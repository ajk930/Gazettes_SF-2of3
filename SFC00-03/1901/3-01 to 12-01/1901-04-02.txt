"Did you sjy Shady?" asked the minister,
who Was about to baptize the child.
"Yes," rerillod the mother. ."You sea our
name Is Bower and my husband thoueht he
would like to have her called - Shady, because
Shaily Bower sounds so pretty."
However that may.be, rightly was San Jose
named the Garden City. We have but lo look
about us to verify this. As our eyes roam the
hills we see a series of terraced lawns, dotted
here and there by a beautiful bunch of blos
soms; as we look over the .valley It is n sou of
flowers: bevond are the noble redwoods rear
| ing their giant heads, while at cur feet are the
waters of the sunlit bay. Nature has smiled
upon ua and ; our soil- iÂ«' as. fertile as our lo- ;
cation is, beautiful. .:-,,, Â¦ .-,
Doubtless there are gentlemen present who
came to this city by means of the- old stage
coach or by boat to Alviso and from thereby
stasre. Surely, many recall the day when the
first train milled Into town a auarter of a
century agoâ I hope, however, with a different
feeling and appreciation than the old stage
driver, who 6aid, "A hoss may run away with
ye, I don't deny it. but there's limits to how
far he can run. But if one of them darned ln
frine-a runs away w!tb ye, it's Pacific Ocean,
riiump! or Roeky Mountain, bump! so far as
I can see. Xo slrree'. Give me a hoss, but
nary an inrlne." '
Now all roads lead to San Jose. If we come
by way ot the south, we pass through the
orange groves frascrant with blossoms; then on
the edge of the summer sea fanned by its re-,
freshing breezes; then through the mountains
and up the fertile valley, to the metropolis of
this district. Bhould the traveler come from
the north, he finds the scenery varied, thouph
equally Interesting. After leaving the great
pine forests he skirts the base of the noble
F-hasta with its crown of eternal snow; then
through the famous Sacramento Valley and
down to the Oarden of the State. No more
delightful trip could be planned, no more fit
ting climax or Joyful ending. -We hail the offi
cers of the company which has Just completed
this famou3 line. It Is a happy consumma
tion of our hopes.
San Jose is near enousrh to .- the bay to re
ceive the benefit cf the ocean breeze with Its
life-fciving ozone, which tempers the warmest"
day and soften* the coolest weather. And it
is far enoujrh Inland to escape the harsh winds
or disagreeable fogrs. - The air Is quite dry and
peculiarly Invigorating, more . mild i and uni
form than in most sections of the State.

Yesterday San Jose and the lovely Santa
CUra valley, this paradise, were established
upon the -highway of nations, were located upon
the tlircucli route between the Occident and
the Orient, between the Eastern States of
America and San Francisco. Henctforth trav.
elers for Europe and the Eastern .States of
America going to Â£an Francisco by way of
the Southern routes, the popular routes for the
â¢ tourist, must pass through this Eden on their
way.
Sir. Chairman, I believe "the future for this
community >Â»nd for this valley looks brighter
then Â«ver before, end though not in -whole nor
in Rxeater part Â«5ue to the completion of. this
road, yet the enterprise which we are cele
bratins -is ' suspicious. It will Â¦ measurably
contribute to tho peace and prosperity of this,
the fairest of California's fair lands. I be
lieve that out of the experience and tribula
tloni of this season, a remedy will be found
for the atscovrapemer.t* and ills of the prune
BTowrrs. -- 1 believe' it. is the purpose of Presi
dent Hays to address himself to the inquiry
as to what wctent his administration of the
affairs of, the Southern Pacific Company can
promote the Interests and better the condi
tions of tbe fruit growers. I am persuaded
- that neither you nor the railroad people will

wish he < were here to speak for himself. I
am sure you would like him. and it goes with

Is not on trial. Ills . record is made. You
may be assured of his competency, of his fair
dealing, of his justice and that bis published
expressions concerning the policy of the com

An4 now, what >>fcs the completion of this

for us, for San Jose, for Santa Clara County,
for the people of the State and the nation.
Fan Jose has the distinction cf being the ln-
Itlol bay point upon the original Central Pa

gan here, and following the route via Niles
nnd over the LJvermore pass was built to
Sacramento, where its rails joined those of
the Central Pacific proper, but immediately
from the driving of the last spike of the
Central Pacific, these two roads were merged
and formed the first through line. San Jose
has from the beginning been rated p.s a ter
â¢ mlnal bay point. It has enjoyed the same
mind and liberal hand, to me and to mine,
to vou and to yours, to this State and all
the States. ha\-e worked together forcood: and

boy who seemed to be the leader of the crowd:
-. â¢"'Sonny, what are you doing with that dog?

There was a solemn silence, for a few. seconds
and the boy with, the red hair replied:
"Hand him the doff." ' Â¦ â¢â¢
That was an unwarranted reflection on the

But, conceding that some lawyer might have
won the dog, the great profession of the law
Is to-day and' always has been the true rep

The general report to -the members, con
tained these paragraphs of Interest: j - .
"Crops, both ; In California and In
Europe, prior to the curing of. them, were
very . much underestimated: â¢ in conse
quence, the growers have realized go^.-l
prices,. but the speculator and dealer have
generally been badly left, the situation Jn
Europe apparently being much worse than
in this country. In California Â¦ the est. 1 -
mate up to harvest time was 3500 cars for
the State; the association. Tiowever. up to
this time, has handled 3500 cars and at
least 1000 cars have been handled outside.
* The actual amount received from sales
to date by the association is a trifle less
than last year, but the market has ab
sorbed a much larger quantity of outside
raisins. The packing company bought
from the association 2343 cars, about 1S0O
of which were paid for; a bill for the bal
ance due was rendered December . 10 of
$566,459 57 and payment demanded therefor.
Up to this date tho packing company
has failed to pay the amount due from
them.- This has obliged us. in order to at
once equalize the advances to growers, so
that all would be treated alike, to make
arrangements with the banks to advance
this amount of money. It must be re
membered that of the total amount ad
vanced to the growers four-fifths has
come from raisins ould and delivered and
only Â¦ one-fifth has oeen advanced by the
bankers. . - > . .
The failure on the part of the packers'
company, to meet its engagements was
mainly due to thÂ© Eastern buyer repudi
ating his contracts to purchase, in con
sequence of the market being flooded by
the above-mentioned 1000 cars of outside
raisins at cut prices.
Â¦ This brings .us to what, in the opinion
of the directors. Is the point of vital in
terest to all raisin growers, viz.: That
the association must obtain control of*the
raisin crop of the State or go out of busi
ness. If . we have control any board of
directors, of ordinary business ability can
run It successfully, but with 25 per cent
on the outside the best financiers and
business men of Europe and America can
not do so. In order to obtain this object
it Is essential to have directors in ofnee
: generally acceptable" to the growers, so
that all old friends of the association will
rally. .to its support and that those who
have heretofore stayed on the outside
may be induced to join, and thereby en
able us to make our association the
grand success it should be. ; Â¦

deavoring for some lime to have his wife
arrested. He called at the Courthouse
and repeatedly demanded that she be sent
to the Stenscoom Asylum.
From the facts elicited at the hearing-
It appears that the Gordons married twen
ty years ago in California. About eight
v'ears later they separated and since have
iivÂ«d apart. For tliÂ« Jirst few years after
the separation Mrs. Gordon was able to
care for herself, but three years ago she
wrote to her husbar.a for money. None
was sent. Instend iv.o physicians had her
arrested for Insanity, examined her. pro
nounced her case miia but needing treat

California asylum. She was confined for
tv.o years and relensed as cored. At the
time she was unab'.c to determine who
had caused her arrest, but she now be
lieves that it v.as ncr husband. She was
in # a nervous condition: but the physicians
â¢were unable to iind any evidences what
ever of insanity.
When Mrs. Gordon was discharged to

Tallman. who advisea the husband to go
from the court and make suitable provis

San Mateo Â« County was to-dky given a
verdict of $7500 in his libel luit against
Editor O'Keefe of the Redwood City
Times-Gazette. The jury was out an hour

Mansfield and Judge Buck during the trial
of Frederick Desirello lor the murder of
James Johnson, a boy, at Colma. Desir
ello was a Deputy Sheriff at the time he
committed the murder. . Editor O'Keefe
declared that the Sheriff had done nothing
to aid in the prosecution of Desirello, but
â¢instead had blocked the prosecution.
Judge Buck was accused of favoring
Desirello. Mansfield took exception to
these statements and began suit for $10,
000 damages. â¢ . â¢
Attorney Richards, for O'Keefe. will ap

Jewelers say that the value of the goods
when, new was not less than $1000. The
police, at Coif ax are of the opinion that

burglar either died, was sent to the peni

The Taylors were en route to Baker
City, Or., when attacked by the masked
robbers. Joseph had left the freight train
and was walking about to keep warm
when they attacked him. took his money
and forced him with revolvers to climb
upon the train. Later the Taylors and
the robbers met \r\ the center of a loaded
coal car, where a desDerate fight ensued.
Each brother attacked a robber and beat
him with chunks of coal. Lennan was
thrown from the train into a ditch, but
soon returned, having caught on the rear
end of the freight train. He began shoot
ing at the Taylors, who were beating his
partner.
Lennan was again crmauered and thrown
overboard, breaking his hit). He was pick

Taylor's clothes were punctured in two

Track Notes.
SMOOTH, slippery Sly fooled those
players who put their checks
down and tried to call the turn in
the introductory sprint at Tan
foran yesterday. Last Friday : the
mare finished third to Dangerous Maid
and Headwater when an even money fa
vorite, and the latter was the anointed
one. It' was different yesterday, . for,
after Yellowtail had led the fast bunch,
to within a short distance of the wire.
O'Connor, on Sly, -backed down from .7 to
1. got Tip in tlmo. to earn the decision by
a neck. In 1:13%. For the first- time in
his career Headwater.' the favorite, ap
parently propped with Mounce just after,
the start, falling out of the running.
Frank Bell performed badly and Sad Sam
was nosed out for third position by
Hagerdon. Those in on the know placed
a well defined crimp in the ring over the
winner's improved showing. â¢ Â¦
Seventeen bookmakers again made the
weight and could the " jarring they re
ceived in the first round be passed over,
had a fairly profitable day of it. Upsets
werâ¬ numerous, only Â«ne ' favorite, Beau
Ormonde, taking a purse.. Flora Pomona
and Lena were the star long shots.
The highly touted Cruzados fell by the
wayside in the two-year-old scramble at
four furlongs. The Emperor of Norfolk
colt was played down from even to 7 to
10, with O'Connor up.. He was slow to get
in motion, breaking from the inside, and
could get no closer up at the finish than
fourth. In a hard drive Flora Pomona
beat Lucien Appleby a head, with E. W.
Brattain a close third. v â¢
Burns and Waterhouse's roguish brown
horse Gibraltar concluded to show what
he could do, and in the Â«six-furlong sell
ing- event stepped ?off the distance cleverly
in 1:13. Hermoso made quite a splurge
out in front until well into the stretch,
where Gibraltar, under Turner's excellent
handling, passed him. Maggie Davis, the
favorite, would have been second but for
O'Connor's persistency in trying to get
througa on the rail.
Lena, at odds of 15 to 1, upset all cal
culations in the mile and a furlong selling
affair. J. Ransch had the mount on the
old mare, and in front from the start, ran
in an easy winner over the favorite, Bar
rack Redwald found the route too far,
finishing a fair third. Topmast made a
poor showing after a bumpy voyage.
Completely outclassing the other start
ers. Beau Ormonde enjoyed a cake-walk
in the :fifth number, over seven furlongs.
Held a 1 to 6 choice the colt breezed home
half a. dozen lengths ahead of Compass
and Merlda. Â¦ -
Pat Dunne's three-year-old. Benson
Caldwell, ran most disappointingly in. the
concluding mile selling "event. He wa3
heavily bet on at 6 to 5, and displaying
no speed, finished last of the four starters.
Bernota easily assumed. the lead, win
ning as he liked from Tony Lepping.

Commissioner Evans is not an office
seeker. He did not seek the post he holds
and he does not ask another as a consola
tion for quitting it, but he does not care
to surrender under fire or step down and
out at the command of his enemies. The
President would like to give Evans a good
diplomatic position and at one time
thought of sending him to Japan, but
Minister Buck Is anxious to remain there
and the President did not care to displace
him.
Owing to the indignities which have been
put upen him In Caracas it is inferred in
administration circles that Minister
Loomis will not care to return to Caracas.
His Ill-health may indeed pre\ent his re
turn to the capital. In that case It is
probable that H. Clay Evans, now Com
missioner of Pensions, will be sent tut
Minister to Venezuela. There has been a
persistent warfare upon . Commissioner
Evans from certain Grand Army in
fluences for two or three years and while
the President sustains Evans' adminis
tration of the Pension Office, he naturally
desires to have in it a man who is not
reg-arded by old soldiers and pensioners as
hostile to them. The President will noi
remove Commissioner Evans, but if he
can find for him a more congenial po<*t
and one which will be regarded as a pro
motion he will make a change
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, X.
W.. WASHINGTON, April l.-Minister
Frank B. Loomis is on his way home from
Venezuela, not because of a controversy
over the asphalt concessions there' or be
cause of the revolutionary tendencies in
the country. The American Minister has
in some way incurred the hostility of the
official and unofficial press at Caracas, if
not that of the Castro Government, until
his presence in Caracas is of no advan
tage to the United States, but rather an
embarrassment. He nas asked for a leave
of absence, which has been granted. He
has been instructed to come home for
consultation with the President and Sec
retary of State. Until he reacnes Wash
ington, some time next ween, and this
conference has been held, no course of ac
tion toward Venezuela will be determined
upon.
The asphalt controversy has been a pui
xllas one because both concessionaries aro
Americans, claiming the protection of this-
Oovernment while they are at war with
each other. But this controversy, while
being the original cause of irritation., has
no part in the recall of Minister Loomis..
Venezuela stands in a peculiar relation
to the United States because of the atti
tude this Government took in .regard In
the Venezuelan boundary question. We
took a riEk of war with Great Britain to
assert the Monroe doctrine and- protect
Venezuela from the aggression of Great
Britain. We insisted that Great Britain
should submit her case to arbitration.
Now the administration feels some deli
cacy in bringing: Venezuela to sharp ac
count because of what it has done for the
little republic. It does not care to give
the impression abroad that the United
States compelled England to keep "hanas
off in order that we might exercise arbi
trary authority over Venezuela. It
thought that the absence of the United
States Minister from the Venezuelan capi
tal may cool the judgment of the authori
ties there..

question Mr. Moore, Patrick's attorney,
said he thought the witness ought to be
cautioned against : testifying to anything
that might incriminate herself. " . Â¦
â¢ Mrs. Francis testified that she had
known Patrick since January, 1S93. Pat
rick bearded with her at the time of his
arrest. She was also acquainted with Da
vid I. Short and Morris Meyers and with
Potts, all of whom have figured in the
case. Patrick occupied the back parlor in
her house.. She herself had no stated
room, she said, In reply to a question by
Mr. Osborne.
"When did Patrick, begin to speak to
you about Mr. Rice?" asked Mr. Osborne.
"I decline to answer, on the advice of
my lawyer," witness replied.
"On what ground?" asked Mr. Osborne.
'.'On the ground that it would incrim
inate," Mrs. Francis answered. Assistant
District Attorney Osborne said there was
no intention of implicating the witness
with Patrick, but she still refused to tes
tify. . . . .-.,...
Justice Jerome then asked the witness:
"Do you believe the answer to this ques
tion would tend to convict you of a crime?
Understand, not Patrick, nor Short, nor
Meyers, nor anybody else but yourself." â¢
The witness thought a while, .,. "I do
think it would tend to incriminate me,"
she finally said. .â¢" . / - ,
' There was some more argument, and
finally Justice Jerome said:
"If the witness is willing to- place her
self in such a position in the community
as she does through her testimony I don't
see that I can compel her to answer. She
js an intelligent woman and fully under
stands this question. Are you willing to
stand in that light?" Justice Jerome add
ed, turning to witness.
*"I am," witness said. Â»
It came out in the testimony that the
witness had been told by a lawyer that if
she said anything favorable to Patrick the
District Atjtorney would have her arrest
ed. The case was continued until to-mor
row. '. â¢ .... Â¦, ' - . . " . . - Â¦ .

-. Â» â
WINTERS. April 1.â Evidence of a
brutal murder was discovered this morn
ing by cattle-herders in the finding of the
body of Albert M. Anderson in a gulch a
half mile west of Winters. The body lay
some seventy-five feet from the road, at
the foot nf * bluff, over which it had been
thrown and then dragged to a hiding
place.
Anderson lived with Colonel Samuel
Taylor, a mile and a half from town, on
the Pleasant Valley read. He was In
town on Sunday until 19 o'clock at night
and then started for home. That was the
last seen of him alive.
The murdered man's skull had been
crushed In with some heavy weapon. Aa
it was known he had no money, no doubt
the murder was committed for revenge.
The motive leading to the crime is
cloaked in mystery. The highway where
the murder was committed is constantly
traveled and the night was very light, so
the deed must have been done by a per
son well prepared and lying in wait.

cjous as Terrible Terry . himself .
His muscles do not stand out in bunches,
but â¢ tbelr rapid play | under ." his smooth
white skin gives ample ' evidence . that
he is possessed of- great strength. It
may not be known to ; local ring-goers that
Oscar is a married man and has two chil
dren. His eldest boy. is aged 5, and the
clever featherweight idolizes the young
ster. Gardner is only 29 years old, but
he has been -in", the ring : for the past
twelve years. During his long career lie
has won innumerable battles. Â¦ His record Â¦
of victories is along one. The cleverest
men at his'weight have gone down in de
feat before him. True, he has met defeat
at the hands of McGovern, but as. better
and heavier men- .have done likewise, this
is not a disgrace. 1 Gardner hopes to re
trieve his defeat .when he meets McGov

Gardner has arrived early on the .field
and will begin ; serious work at Croll's

clever Joe Bernstein to .work with him.
Bernstein has had the distinction of fight

Gardner and i Bernstein are familiar with
Terrible Terry's style of boxing, and this,
they think, will stand Gardner , in good
stead at the next meeting. Bernstein 1s
also the retired champion 115-pound wrest

men will engage ' in heavy mat-work, to

McGLADE'S TRIAL
GOES ON SLOWLY
Evidence Presented Show
ing Guilty Knowledge
of Defendant.
Proof . Adduced That Accussd Man
Admitted Cashing Salary De
mands KnowingThat They
Were Forged.
Direct evidence of his crime was brought
home to Peter McGlade at the proceedings
In his trial yesterday on a charge of forg
ing salary warrants on the city treasury
In 1598.
The second week of the fourth trial ot
McGlade seems destined to pass without a.
verdict belnjr reached, judging by thÂ»
progress of the case yesterday. The hear
ing was dull in comparison with the pre
vious week, for Judge Melvln has put a
stop to the bickerings between counsel
and the "badgering"* of witnesses by At
torney Lennon for the defense, as de
fined by District Attorney Byington. Len
non made but one break of decorum yes
terday, when he sneeringly told Wltnes*
Regensburger that he was "too ready to
give evidence." Judge Melvln reproved
Lennon, and for the rest of the day thÂ«
attorney wag on his good behavior.
Proof of McGlade's Guilt.
Charles True, a clerk for Regenaburger,
who had cashed the forged salary war
rants, testified that McGlade had told
him on October 4. 1S98. that he (McGladO
had collected the money on various salarv
warrants, Including the "John Sullivan
warrant, on which the indictment in the
case is founded. This statement was madÂ»
by McGlade when Clerk True had gone to
the office of the Street Superintendent to
secure from McGlade the salary warrants
on which Regensburger had advanced
money.
Ex-Treasurer Reis testified to having
paid a number of salary warrants Intro
duced In evidence. Bookkeeper Catncart
testified that no entries, as called for by
the warrants introduced, appeared on the
books of the Superintendent of Streets.
Ex-Supervisor Hasklns recognized his sig
nature on the various warrants, placed on
them for the purpose of auditing. John
Ryan, assistant clerk to the Supervisors,
gave similar testimony. s
Memory of Ambrose Is Faulty.
The memory of ex-Superintendent of
Streets Ambrose was as faulty yesterday
as when he previously testified in the
case. Ambrose told how McGlade disap
peared from the office In November. 1838.
but the -witness could not remember if hn
tried to search for the missing man. HÂ«
remembered meeting McGlade on Market
street some time afterward, but did not
know the date. Ambrose stated that, he
had never sought an explanation from
McGlade as to his disappearance.
H. Regensburger, money broker, testi
fied to having known *McGlade for some
years and having had business dealings
with him. The witness swore positively
to McGlade's signature as it appeared on
the forged warrants.
Detective Gibson testified that ha
searched for McGlade in November and
December, 1S98, but could not locate him.
The witness stated that Â»he arrested Mc-
Glade on December 7. ISPS, at Oakland
mole, receiving him from the custody of
: Deputy Sheriff Phillips of Demlng, N. M.
The evidence that McGlade -was passing:
under an assumed name at the time was
stricken out of tho record.
F. J. Ehrmann, late of Demlng. N. M..
testified that he had seen McGlade In tha
custody of the deputy sheriff, in Deming.
Theodore Kytka was also on the witness
stand for a brief period, and stated that
the signatures of "Peter W. McGlade" on
the alleged forged salary warrants were
in the handwriting of the defendant.
The hearing of the case will be resumed
this morning at 10 o'clock.

President Newhall thought it proper to
remove the women and on his motion it
was decided to order the Chief of Police
to close the objectionable houses. Formal
notices were served on the keepers and
they were given a reasonable time in
which to move or suffer arrest.
Last night Chief Sullivan, accompaniftd
by Captain Wlttman. made a tour of the

&>s-|-saHE Robert Etowningr engagement
I at the Central Theater began last
II * night with "The Gladiator," Mr.
UL Downing' s SCOlst presentation of
the name role. It Is too late in the
day to comment upon 'Mr. Do wiring's pos
session of the gladiator habit, his per
formance to-day being just what it was
ten, five, two years ago, and probably
just what It will be ten years hence. The
Central audience, however, accepted the
new star with a flattering cordiality,
marred only by a slight dissent from his
somewhat strenuous methods signified in
the usual manner by the rude gods of
the gallery. Much praise Is due Mr.
Downing for the very effective setting the
piece has received, and also for the man
ner in which all the available energies of
the Central stock company have, been
utilized. ' , ,
Lorena At wood Is cast as Faustina, and
does a very creditable piece of work in
the role. Miss Atwood is always reliable,
and if she would learn to walk, her pleas
ing personality would be still more effect
ive. Fay Courtney is the Neodamia, the
gladiator's daughter, and in spite of her
manv elocutionary sins, is a charming
and pretty figure.
Robert F. Cummlngs, a new legiti
mate" engaged to support Mr. Downing,*
is a graceful and Intelligent Flavian, with
a matinee heroism hanging over his de
voted head. James M. Ward gives the
Origen, the Christian priest, without in
spiration, but with much quiet dignity,
and drew the usual "amen" from somÂ©
Lenten devotee, who had war "ered into
the theater by mistake. The pagan
priest's part was in the hands of Miron
Leffingwell, and a more badly pitched
performance it would be impossible to
imagine. Mr. Lefflngwell brings the man
ners, voice and gestures of his Yankee
spy in "The Heart of Maryland" to his
conception of the role, and a more
flagrantly off-key effect could not be de
vised. It lacks every necessary quality.
The mounting of "The Gladiator" is
very satisfactory, not to say splendid, and
the second scene in Flavian's palace, with
its little ballet, is particularly well
handled. Altogether it is not "thumbs
down!" when the performance is to be
judged, at the Central prices, and the
week will probably see the good audiences
of last nieht repeated.
"Ingomar" will be presented next week.
Alcazar.
Scott Marble's dramatization of "Ten
nessee's Pardner," Bret Harte's idyllic
"pipe dream" of California miners and
gamblers, not as they are in life but as
sentimental boarding school misses would
like them to be, made a sympathetic audi
ence laugh and cry by turns for four acts
that were of so much Interest that they
did not seem to be long. Miss Convere's
Tennessee Kent was artless in Its art and
held the sympathy of the house all
through. Joseph Kilgour's .gambler,
"legitimate and high-toned;" was played
with a quiet dignity characteristic of
gambler gentlemen endowed with the
Bret Harte qualification. The trusting
husband of the wicked woman, who is too
easily converted into the path of recti
tude was a meritorious effort in the
hands of Howard Scott, while Agnes
Ranken was a trifle listless as the newly
wedded bride. Messrs. Emery and
Webster filled In the background of the
chaiacter sketch, but Mr. Webster
seemed to labor under the hallucination
that he was a Roman tragedian instead
of an ordinary American villain.
The fun of the play was contributed by
the quaint acting of Frank Bacon as Gee
whllliker Hay and Margaret Marshall as
the termagant Mrs. Hay. Fun bubbles
out of Bacon like petroleum out of oil
prospectuses.
"Tennessee's Pardner" was a pro
nounced success and it is sure tp have a
good week's run.
Orpheum.
All tastes in the amusement line are
catered to in the excellent bill presented
at the Orpheum ihis week. One. would In
deed have to be maliciously critical to ob
ject to a single number in the programme
presented. Miss Marie Wainwrlght, sup
ported . by clever people, was seen in a
sketch. "Napoleon and Josephine." The
clever actress is as magnetic as ever and
her Empire gowns are a revelation.
Vaudeville patrons are fortunate in being
able to see Miss "Walnwright and should
not miss the opportunity." Fuller, < Moller
and Burke have a rollicking farce, en
titled "Over the Pike." It is nonsensical
but mirth-provoking and introduces many
pretty ballads.
Quick changes of dress and character
songs are the features of a number pre
sented by "A Girl of Quality." The
absence of the young lady's name from
the programme gives rise to considerable
epecualtion. She Is a feature of this
week's performance. Hamilton Hill, the
popular barytone, returns with a budget
of new songs and rouses as much en
thusiasm as ever. The performing dogs of
Tschernoff. the sketches of Callahan and
Mack, Scott and Wilson and tfc- new
biograph views round out one of the best
Orpheum offerings In many months. .
Tivoli.
That- pleasing opera, . "The Wedding

Alleged to Have Violated the Law
Customs Surveyor Spear filed a report

Captain Freeman is a pilot under the

WASHINGTON, April 1.â The findings
of the Military Court. of Inquiry which
investigated the treatment alleged to have
been accorded to the late Oscar L. Booz,
a former cadet at West Point Military
Academy, have been made public at the
War DeDartment. The , findings of the
military court are summed "up in a letter
written to Secretary Root which .accom
panies the report. The letter says: , ' Â¦-.;
"The findings of this court of inquiry,
which are sustained by the evidence, show,
that the statements, which. led ta the con
vening of the court, to the effect that for
mer Cadet Oscar L. Booz came to his
death by reason of injuries received by
hazing at. the academy, were not true.
They show that at the timo Cadet Booz
was a. member of the academy hazing
was prevalent there to a deplorable . ex
tent; that the present officers of the acad
emy have shown -commendable energy,
zeal and efficiency in detecting and pun
ishing offenses of this character, and that
they greatly decreased the practice and
improved. the public sentiment among the
cadets upon the subject. - -
"The testimony and findings of the court
were placed in the hands of the.commit
tee of Congress charged at about the same
time with' the investigation of the sub
ject and the very efficient ; and beneficial
action of that committpe, followed by. the

CADET HAZING
NOT THE CAUSE
When Clara McCann -appeared at the
Hall of Justice yesterday afternoon at 2
o'clock, when the case "of vagrancy
against her was to :. be called in Judge
Mogan's court, Policeman" Sylvester fol
lowed her Into the warrant clerk's office
and served her with the warrant issued
last I November, accusing her of attempt
ing to extort . $2500 from - Christian W.
Smith. She was taken to the City Prison,
booked on the charge and promptly re
leased on bail . furnished by Walter Gal
lagher, her attorney. -
Miss McCann went to, Judge Mogan's
court, and Attorney Gallagher vehemently
attacked the Police Department for what
he alleged was persecution. "This wo
man, comes into court," said Gallagher,
"to ' answer , the charge of vagrancy,
against her and she is pounced upon -by
a policeman and served with a warrant
that has been in the hands of the Police
Department for over, four months. 'The

him here to prove it. It seems as If there
was no intention of serving the subpena.'.
Attorney W. S. Barnes was in court and
said he represented Christian W. Smith,
the complaining- witness in the case of
attempted extortion. He said Mr. Smith
refused to prosecute the case, as the wo
man had not annoyed him since and he
wanted it dismissed. The Judge remarked
that the case was in Judge Cabaniss' court

Clara McCann Arrested on
the Warrant Issued
Last November.,
The mustering but of the Twenty-sev
enth Infantry at the Presidio yesterday
was 'conducted under conditions that af
forded the soldiers an opportunity, to "get
even" with certain storekeepers in the
neighborhood of the military reservation
and others of the human vampire : specie *:
Early in the morning the grafters, began
to gather and their number kept increas
ing until at 12 o'clock there were so many
of those bipeds, who make an easy living
off the unsophisticated ; soldiers, congre
gated around the entrance to the Pre
sidio that, it became necessary to adopt
drastic, measures to protect the soldiers.
Colonel Cummins of the Twenty-seventli
was informed of the condition of affairs
arid immediately had the camp of the
Twenty-seventh surrounded by a mounted
guard, which was ordered to Keep all.per
sons out of the camp who coulu give no
valid reason for their presence. The gua:d
obeyed the order to the letter with the
result that fully lt/0 men, who have bec.\
hanging around the camps for some time
past, were driven" from the reservation.
The guard .was under the S command of
Provost Sergeant Davis, who has been
stationed at the. Presidio for a number ot
months and is thoroughly acquainted with
the men who have been in the habit 01
tieecing the soldiers.- Under his direction
numerous "individuals, who have been
under the impression that a soldier is
easy, game, were ordered out. At the en
trance to the Presidio the â¢ grafters I fell
into the hands of the police officers, who
kept them on the move. The result of
this concerted movement on the part of.
the police and military .-. was a freedom
from the wily schemers such as has not
been enjoyed for some time by the reg'-'
ments mustered out at the Presidio.
The Twenty-seventh was paid off by
Majors Campbell and Belknap. As a re
sult of the payment of the soldiers and
their release "from the army regulations
the police officers were kept very busy
During the day several arrests were
made, but the most serious charge wa*
drunkenness. Several soldiers were taken
to the North End police station and co.i
nned until the effects of too frequent in
dulgence in Presidio whisky had worn off.
This attention to the soldiers was given
in order to prevent the troopers, upon
whom liquor works like a torch on a oile
of shavings, from gathering in crowds.
Lieutenant .Knox of Company A, Twen
ty-seventh Infantry was the happiest man
in the camp of that regiment yesterday.
During- the day he was presented with a
beautiful silver loving cup from, the men
of the company 1 he commanded. The cup
is a handsome affair and was given to the
lieutenant as a token of the esteem In
which he is held by his men "on account
of his many sterling qualities and efforts
on behalf of the men while in camp and in
the field." >
Palmer Hughes, private Company B,
Twenty-second Infantry, died yester'day
at the .General Hospital from dysentery.
The many friends of Captain Orrin B.
Wolfe thronged his tent in I the Mod*l
Camp yesterday . and tendered him the ; r
congratulations upon his promotion to a
captaincy. Captain Wolfe is another of
the soldiers who have risen -from ; the
ranks by reason of merit. He is a hero
of two campaigns, having- served in CuEa
and the Philippines, conducting: himself
with- such bravery in both campaigns as
to receive from his superiors mention for
conspicuous gallantry. Captain Wolfe is

After a bountiful repast. President Greg
ory in a few well chosen words introduced
IV. H. Mills, who spoke on the subject
' 'Forests of California." Mr. Mills, by
quoting facts and figures, demonstrated
the vital importance of the forests to thÂ«
welfare of the State and claimed that it
was the duty of every citizen to prevent
the ruthless destruction of the monarcha
of the leafy kingdom. He cited the ex
amples of France and Germany, which
countries spent millions of dollars to pre
serve their forests and increase the
growth of the trees. The danger of forest
tires and decrease in moisture were ably
dwelt upon by the speaker, who was
v.armly applauded when he concluded his
addres-s. .
Professor Le Conte was heartily wel
cimed when introduced by the chairman.
â¢The distinguished geologist gave a most
tirarr.ed address on "The Mountains of
California," and was listened to for an
.hour with marked attention. The speaker
jowelt on the value of communion with
ir.ature and said that part of his life was
'.to beheld each year the grandeur of the
; superb mountains of California. The geo
. iog-ic-al history of the mountains was ex
plained by Professor Le Conte and many
â¢scientific subjects were touched upon.
. Professor E'.wood Mead spoke on "The
Rivers of California." He described In
.humorous vein the many claims to water
:i-iphts filed in this State and caused hearty
laughter by saying that California would
iÂ«e inundated if she possessed half as
much water as the claims called for. He
â¢dwelt on the possibilities of development
utt California jf the waters and forests
were preserved. The speaker claimed that
riparian rights must be abrogated and
t hat no person liad the right to lay claim
to water which was public property. Pro
fessor Mead argued for the establishment
of a proper tribunal to determine the wat
er rights and end the interminable litiga
tion. He said that the present system of
water rights was injurious to public in
terest and that an end should be put to
this state of affairs. Professor Mead was
loudly cheered at the close of his speech.

THE WAY OF THE CONQUEROR.
READERS who have given even the most casual
attention to the situation, in Manchuria have
noted the conflict between the stories of Rus
sian aggression told by newspaper correspondents in
that part of the world and the official statements of
the Russian Government. According to the cor
respondents, American, British and German, the Rus
sian armies .have actually taken possession of Man
â¢churia; while according- to the diplomats there has
been no aggression of any kind, ; nor has the Russian
Government even made a demand upon China for a
concession of sovereignty in the province.
In passing judgment upon these conflicting reports
and statements some persons have doubtless decided
that the correspondents had exaggerated affairs, while
ethers have been of the opinionthat the" t-.' Russian
Government has been practicing diplomacy in accord
with Talleyrand's rule that words' were given to man
t) enable him to "conceal his thoughts. It may.b'e that
justification exists for each of those views, but another
explanation has now been given which impugns the
veracity of neither tht correspondents nor of the dip
lomats. It amounts to a statement, that the Russian
Government, as a matter of fact, has never been ag
gressive in Manchuria, while at the same time it con
firms the reports that Russian troops have completely
durninated the province. v Â¦ 7
- According to the new explanation, which is furnished;
to the Pall Mall Gazette by a traveler in Manchuria,
tl> Russian general in that province is acting without
'orders. From a summary that comes to us. of his
statement it appears the commander, of the Russian
forces is proceeding on the principle that "a con
queror can never' be punished," and, unless checked
by force, will take possession of North China as wall
as of Manchuria. He is said recently/ to have summed
up.the situation as follows: "France is our bank,
America is governed by women, Germany is too slow,
ancVEngland is finished y therefore Asia will fall into
our hands." ;. ': - . " .
If that statement be true the Russian Government is
playing a policy that has been practiced since ever ag-'
gressive: empires began^n the world. It has not been
an 'uncommon thing ..for "conquerors, to permit
a Â¦Â¦ commander to , go ahead,, while, reserving the
privilege' of disclaiming his actions if events should
nuJce it necessary, but at the same time being always
ready to profit by them .if occasion serve. The Rus
sian general has plenty of historic' precedent to justify
his assertion. that conquerors are never punished. He
â¢s playing for big , stakes, and : if fortune be with him
we may be sure that however emphatically the diplo
mats of "Russia may deny having given him authority
to act/ his Government will ' not remove him from
command unless, indeed/ it be thought advisable to
give him a higher one. ,
Carnegie up to this time has not given any notable
amount of money to' the British since he arrived in
their country," but "he has given them advice to the
effect that they should put a heavy export duty on coal
so as to prevent' the waste of their fuel supply, and
perhaps the advice is more valuable than any amount
of money he could have given them.
peoples would mean submersion. The ex
perience gained in the small laboratories
of the West Indies has npt inspired the
Frenchâ save a few doctrinaires, incapa
ble of learning and forgettingâ with the
desire of applying the policy on a larger
scale. : -- *>_>Â¦>'.: , . Â¦ .
The result is, therefore, that the French
colonial empire, incloses an immense num
ber of negroes whose social status is only
touched upon with the greatest precau
tion. In the African territories the colon
ial administration of the natives is still
rudimental. In the fetichistic countries of
the Congo the black villages keep their
chiefs, whose excesses are repressed by
the French administrator if they go be
yond all measure, unless the tribes be too
far away from control. In the Sudan, on
Mussulman ground, we have begun by a
work of substitution. The great Moham
medan conquerors and slave-hunters had
destroyed the local groupings; we have re
made them as well as possible, aided by
the natural tendency of the Sudanese pop
ulations toward municloal combination.
In Madagascar the village represents
the native unit, though there is already
d slightly more developed organization to
be fcund there. In tJhort, it might be said
that at the present time the French pos
sessions of Africa are divided into an im
mense ' number of small protectorates,
governing themselves under a somewhat
scattered supervision, as are, moreover,
the different French posts.
French, Have Brought Peace.
This does not mean that the French ad
ministration lacks interest in the progress
of the native population. By a continual
pressure it tries to abolish barbarous cus
toms. It represses as much as possible
the remnants of cannibalism. It has
suppressed the slave trade, and if it toler
ates domestic slavery, which is a form of
the family life in the societies of West
ern "Africa, it watches lest it become bar
barous. It prevents as much as it can the
pursuit of fugitive slaves by their mas
ters. :Â¦Â¦ .'>> Â»â¢ Â« .,-;
For the sake of justice we must admit
that the French have introduced an un
known evil Into their African domains, a
hundred times smaller, indeed, than the
barbarian tyrants whom they overthrew,
yet still very injuriousâ It Is the forced
labor system. In the countries where the
European administration was active and
exacting â in Madagascar, for, instance â it
became â¢ odious to the natives. In Congo
it caused small revolutions. But forced
labor has just been suppressed in Mada
gascar and elsewhere, and it is being re
placed more and more by paid labor. - *
In Indo-China the French encountered
an advanced society with graded office
holders, and â¢ they naturally wished to
govern through the medium of this hier
archy. -In Tonquln, Annam and Cambodia
the French provincial President controls,
theoretically, only the administrative and
legal acts of the native prefects, who are
high mandarins, drawn as in China from
the class of the literati recruited by ex
aminations. But though the Annamites,
like all the extreme Orientals, have beau
tiful family virtues, they lack administra
tive gifts. They yield regularly to extor

much so that in spite of all theories, from
the simple controllers they were to be the

ministrators, as in the oldest colony of
Cochin-China.
Natives Not "to Be Assimilated.
Our observations show that the French
have renounced the hope of assimilating
the natives, even In colonies where a
large European element should influence
their ideas and customs' strongly by put
ting them under an assimilating admin
istration. Â¦ We see that the present ten
dency is not toward the humanitarian
openness ; of heart of fifty years ago. and
that there. Is little "probability that the
French republic will make citizens of her
'many-colored subjects; at least not in a
future the present generation will live to
see ---. --. .' 'Â¦ --
It has been demonstrated by experience
that -it is very imprudent to attempt a
hasty evolution of subjected races- that
they are enly completely disorganized
thereby and reduced to ungovernable hu
man dust. It pays better to develop the
good in them than ; to force forpis-n
elements upon them. : "'"gn
autonomy upon the colonies says in effect
that taxes may be imposed upon the colo
nies to the extent of the military ex
penses incurred there. ; â¢
Commerce of the Colonies.
The budget of a majority Â¦ of the colo
nies does not yet allow the charging of
such expenses upon them. So "far. such
payments are required from only four
coloniesâ Indo-China, an exceptionally
rich country, which is to contribute $2,160,-"
000 to the home government's war chest,
instead of continuing to contribute direct
ly a" similar sum to the maintenance of
the corps of occupation; French Guinea,
the ivory coast and Dahomey.: The Gov
ernment asks but $2000 from each of these
possessions, as a matter of principle.
The Government subsidizes not only col
onies, but also colonial enterprises, such
as railroads, for example, in Senegal and
Reunion. The state, moreover, guaran
teesthe greater part of the colonial loans,
amounting at present to $82,400,000. Only
the Indo-China loan of $40,000,000 was
raised without a guarantee from the Gov
ernment of France. These, sums, almost
all of which were loaned within the last
two years, do not seem to exceed the fu
ture capacities of the colonies which bor
rowed them, especially when the railroads
and other public works, for the comple
tion of which they are utilized, shall be
finished. ; .
In 1898 the commerce of Algiers amount
ed to Slll.OOO.CO&v of which $90,000,000 was
carried on with France. To this we must
add $21,000,000 for- Tunis (in 1S99),. her com
merce with France amounting to $13,400,
000. >
The conditions of the more distant colo
nies are less bright, though their commer
cial activity is increasing. Their total
commerce has risen from $93,000,000 in 1892
to $116,400,000 in 189S. This is not a very
rapid progress, especially for new coun
tries; but this very newness explains for
the' most part the slowness. We have just
seen that the , French colonies only very
recently borrowed the necessary sums for
the building of railroads, which they al
most entirely lack. Outside of Algeria,
and, exce-pt for the lines from Dakar to
St. Louis and from Senegal to> the Niger
still incompleteâ and a few very i short
roads in Cochin-China and Tor.quin, the
French colonies have no railroads.' Only
the neighboring parts -of the coast thus
far have entered upon the universal com
mercial activity." ' Â¦
Buta more artificial cause delays the
economic development of our possessionsâ
namely, the protective tariffs ; applied to
the majority of them. The experience
gained by- France in this respect should
Interest the United States. These tariffs
inclose virtually the whole of the Fr.ench
empire. The protectionists in power es
.teem the 'possessions beyond the seas
mainly -as a market for France." The na
tives are impoverished by, the necessity
of obtaining their supplies from a market
not naturally adapted to certain of their
needs. They become less able to pay taxes
at the ; very moment when the Governors
are Â» most . inclined to tax them, because
the revenues accruing from the duties are
diminishing. ."By dint of being protective
the tariff ceases to be fiscal.* -in order to
restore the â¢ equilibrium : of the colonial
budget there is no alternative left to the
Governors but to tax the poor natives or
to ask subsideies from : home. ..They gen
erally decide upon the ' latter proceeding.
Protective Tariffs a Handicap.
The high protective tariffs of the colo
nies ; have rather fallen into disfavor in
France of late. â¢ As a result of treaties
they have not been- enforced in the -last
annexed territories, and these territories
are doing so well under this liberal- re
gime that France probably will not intro
duce its customs Into any new.: acquisi
tions it may make in the future. *A'>new
conception is dawning, one that does not
look: at the colonies as a market for the
republic's products, but rather, as a field
for the capital and energy flowing from
the republic.' Â¦ . , ' . . Â¦ .
: Most of the French colonies are tropi
cal lands,** where the white man Is the
overseer of native, labor, and not a true
settler. It- requires but a very limited
European - list ,to prove such colonies | val
uable.' British .India,: where . the number
â¢of English is 1 not much more than' 100,000,

P\A ANY are the stories of heroism and of daring
/ \ that come to us among the reports from" the
Philippines, but not one among them has told
of a braver deed than that of Lieutenant Commander
Jesse M. Roper, who when his gunboat, the Petrel,
was on fire went down into the suffocating smoke to
rescue the seamen below. ;He met" his death in the
effort, and the War Department ; in .announcing the
rews has well laid aside official formality and cold
ress to add, "It was a hero's death." / \ â¢
;Such deeds are not rare 'in the world. Wherever
danger makes a demand upon humanity'there is nearly
always some brave soul to respond. by an act "of self
sacrifice worthy of the honor.- - Again -and
again the press has occasion to record such deeds.
They are performed not by soldiers or by sailors
only. The annals of the Fire and the Police depart
ments of our cities are full of instances of courage
equal to any ever shown upon the battle field, and not
infrequently men upon whom no official duty rests,
aric who are bound by no professional service to con
front danger, show th-mselves ready to risk life and
to give it, if need be, for the purpose of saving an
olher.V.T^''
Common as such deeds are, they should never pass
unnoted by the public. There is so much of pettiness
and meanness in life that we can, well afford to give
some time to the consideration of acts which attest
the essential nobleness of humanity. Lieutenant Com
mander Roper went to his death under circumstances
that show his courage and his high conception of duty
as 'conspicuously as if he had died at the head of a
forlorn hope storming the fortress of an enemy. He
merits, therefore, as much of honor as has been given
to any of the popular heroes of. war. He attests once
more the sterling manhood of* the American officer,
and his deed can be read with gratified pride as well
as with sorrow by every loyal citizen.
It was a hero's death. With that praise from the
War Department the relatives and friends of. the brave
man may take such consolation in their sorrow as can
come to them from The fact that they have not only
the sympathy of their fellow citizens, but that the
memory of .their dead 'will -be cherished, among -the
heroes of the, navy of their county. . .

The military expenditures of France for
1901 on account of her colonies, including
those of Algeria, Tunis and the expedition
to China, will amount to about $38,000,000.
The outlay. for civil expenses in the colo
nies above the local receipts will be 1 about
$8,000,000 additional. The deficit in Algeria
is $3,000,000 out of a total expenditure there
of $14,000,000, . much of which Is for pay

SAN FRANCISCO
SHOULD HAVE
AN AQUARIUM
The Call does not hold itself responsible for
the opinions published in thl3 column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have as communicat:on3 of general Interest.
Editor Callâ Your editorial upon thu
above subject In the Issue , of Saturday
last -was both* interesting and opportune.
The proposition to have an aquarium la
one which commends itself for many rea
sons, as you very clearly show. Few, ii
any, cities afford such easy facilities and
suck natural resources to establish aa
aquarium as San Francisco.
The proximity of pure sea water, tho
extensive- trade with tropical coasts and.
islands and the grreat southern and equa
torial oce#n regions within easy sail of
this city, present possibilities of mainte
nance and of supply *or such an aquarium
that the conclusion you arrive atâ that
there not being one In this city is "a
notabla omission"â is most fully justified.
There is still associated in the minds of
many a sort of weird, mysterious uncar.
nlness about the "creatures that move la
tne waters." This s'entiment, among oth
ers, ever causes an aquarium to be a
popular place of resort, and more espe
cially so if the collection contains speci
mens of tropic and deep sea life, such aa
the climatic conditions of San Francisca
would enable to be successfully main*
tained in captivity. One could almost ba
excused If he stood In open-mouthed won
der when he sees for the first time the
unique and grotesque platax (seabats>
swimming about, with their curious flna
and ill-formed bodies, as if they had bee:*
made "on contract"- rather than a finished
product of the Divine Creator; or per
chance, the still more "freak-like" fucua
seahorse, whose spines with their lon<
filamentous appendages, give the body
such a ragged appearance that it caa
be scarcely distinguished from, the sea
weed, among which this odd creature lives
and exists. As a cause for surprise what
can be said for the paradise nsh or tha,
parrot-wrasse, the brilliant coloring ot
which outshines the most gorgeously;
plumaged bird, and so with many moro
curious types. Even, hundreds of staid,
New Yorkers will parade around the tan*
in the New Tork Aquarium in which tha

as he is named, unfortunately got one oC
his flippers Jammed In the outflow pipiv
of his tank, completely shutting off thÂ«
water, it was deemed sufHciently Interest
ing to be made public by a two-Inch artl-:
cle In the Sun." As to the popularity*
thc-e would be no doubt. But apart from
Its- popularity the aquarium could be mada
distinctly valuable as an adjunct to the*
Board of Trade, where many of the probj,
lems connected with the "fish industry
could be commercially and scientifically"
investigated. The conservation of thoÂ».
fish products of the Pacific Coast is one
of deep concern and demands and li
worthy of as Intelligent treatment as th<3
outputs of the-placer mine or oil field. To
the trade fisherman, as well as the sporting:
angler, the subject of an aquarium should
especiaHy appeal; could they not stimu
late public interest in the matter by ar
ranging, say in the fall of this year or
other seasonable period, a fishery exhibit,
including in that specimens of marine,
lake and river life in all attainable forms;
preserved specimens scientific and com
mercial, and also exhibit methods of fish
ing, boats, tackle, apparatus, In short all
that tends to attract to, to instruct In
or to develop the great field, of which
such a*n aquarium as you propose wouirt
be the best exponent. The subject. In
consideration of Its importance and In
view of the great future of San Francisco,
is one whichâ let us hope â will be deemed
worthy of the indorsement you so fitly

It is stated that the Southern States which since the
war have been importing from the West nearly! all
their corn and hog supplies are now raising nearly
as large a quantity of those articles as the home mar
ket demands and will soon be competitors for the for
eign market. :Thus does the rush toward overproduc
tion operate among farmers as well as among manu
facturers and in the end civilized man may have io
content himself with working only five or six hours a
<"_ay for the simple reason that he can make no use nor
tuid a market for the surplus he might produce by
working longer.

WHEN the diffenflit religious bodies of England
presented addresses to Edward VII he took
occasion to assure them of religious toleration
and his support of freedom of worship. In the Eng
land of to-day, there is not much need of such as
surance from the head of the established church.
Time was that it would have* been an act of grace
and an expression of purpose to be hailed with great
joy by all nonconformists. Bui that time has gone
by. Martyrs are no longer hauled on hurdles to be
burned at Smithfield.- John Bunyan would not
languish in Bedford jail in these days, and Quakers
are not whipped every Friday at the cart's tail. Puri
tans .would not be made to swelter in the pillory if
they still prayed and ranted by the roadside. The
spirit of persecution has passed away. But it has Its
survival in the use of the term "toleration." To tole
rate a thing implies the right to prohibit it. It im
plies, further, that the thing itself is evil, since it is
?.n anomaly to tolerate that which is good. The King
no doubt means that he will defend the right to re
ligious freedom, which is really the sense in which
we make modern use cf the term toleration.
As the King's assurance of protection to religious
liberty was not necessary, the audience given to the
many representatives of the sectaries of his kingdom
w6uld have been without /significance had he not"
specifically addressed the spokesman for. one sect, and
that the least in numbers in. his realm. Turning to
the Quaker he s/iid he' hoped that his reign would wit
ness the general acceptance and application of the
principles represented by that gentleman, and that the
ispirjt of peace and , mutual helpfulness would become
universal.^ We can imagine that the auditors standing
for the numerous and ambitious nonconformist bodies
were astonished by this royal indorsement of the
simple . tenets of the weakest of them all. Yet the
world would get an immediate example to follow
j toward better, conditions "if the King's wish were -at
; once accomplished.
The Quakers were the pioneers against war; they
stood for nonresistance, believing that evil cannot be
overcome by evil, but only by good. In other words;
they literally accepted the sayings of the founder of
Christianity, and regarded that system as a life to be
lived and not a dogma to be contended" over. >
This is the first indorsement given to their view. by
I any ruler of a great naiion. The heads of states who
! are also the heads, of churches, have made perfunctory
professions of Christianity while doing everything
j that is unchristian. '
Â¦ The King seemed to' have a thought of rising eco
j noraic conditions in his dominions, when he referred
1 to the other point in Quaker doctrine and practice,
EDWARD 0ND ThE QUAKERS.
President McKinley has so arranged his tour that
he will visit the Buffalo exposition before he returns
to the capital, consequently it may be said â¢Â¦Â¦he ; is
going to make San Francisco a way station between
Washington and Buffalo; and it would not be a bad
idea for a great many other people in the East to
follow the example.
1~* HE chronically bad condition of Croton water*
in New York has at last revolted the gorge of
Gotham.
Oddly enough its unfitness for drinking water is
regarded as a secondary eviL The people have other
slaking liquids which take the edge off thirst and leave
it as dull as a kindling wood hatchet The offense of
Croton is rank when it is considered as a bathing fluid
znd for flushing purposes. The New York ratepayer
can get along without ever opening a faucet to get
a drink, but he must wash, and flush his 'closets, and
when the water flows for such purposes it smells to
heaven and over several adjacent townships.
One proposition to reform these conditions is to
obsolete the Croton watershed entirely, losing the
hundreds of millions that system has cost, and tap
Lake Ontario for a supply, carrying it across the State
in an open canal, creating necessary reservoirs en
route- To this it is objected that no matter how pure
and perfect the water may be when it leaves limpid
Ontario, canaling and impounding it will expose it
to the aquatic growths and contaminations that beset
all water so handled, and that when its long journey
is finished the consumer will have tp burn a rag .when
he turns it on.
For these reasons a counter proposition is made
that has not only decided merit for that locality but
is suggestive to all seaboard cities.
The plan is to reserve the Croton supply for po
table purposes only, for which it will suffice for a cen
tury to come. It is to be rendered sanitary and pure
by filtering, and is not to be used for bathing or flush
ing purposes at all, except as an auxiliary to the
former.
For those purposes it is proposed to erect stand
pipes at suitable places and pump them full of clean
salt wuier from the sea, to be piped by a separate sys
tem into every house.
This looks feasible and would bring the desirable
and much sought sea bath into every house. For the
nfter shower the use of the filtered Croton would be
permitted.
The immense discharge of salt' water from bath-
tubs and closets would have an excellent anti
ceptic effect on the sewers, and Gotham would be
made healthier; and happier by the change. Now why
not, in cities like San Francisco and Oakland, try
the 'prentice hand of municipal ownership on such a
salt water plant? It could be used also for street
sprinkling. We have salt water of. the best, ; quality
going to waste all around us, or at best used merely
foi navigation. Our sewers need it, and as a bathing
fluid it has no superior.
Why not try it? f
SALT WATER SUGGESTION.
THE isthmian canal will be pleaded in the politics,
of the year, and if Senator Morgan and his fol
lowers can have their way any conclusion will be
prevented in. order to use the waterway in the Con
gTessional campaign of 1902.
. The bill heretofore before Congress to provide the
construction of the canal requires a discrimination in
tolls between foreign and American ships. That is re
garded as a particularly smart provision, an evidence
o.f American enterprise and greatness.'
But those who think so; forget that we must enter
the territory of two independej/t sovereignties to con
struct a canal within their jurisdiction^ and over which
we can exercise no political control. Nicaragua and
Costa Rica are small and weak and may consent to
anything. But what would we say if another country
wanted to construct a canal from the Great Lakes to
the Mississippi River, within our jurisdiction, and de
manded also the right to discriminate in tolls in favor
of its own ships?
In the Clayton'-Bulwer treaty we aiked Great Britain
to recognize the canal as a trust held for the equal ben
efit of all the commercial nations. We asked that this
principle be recognized, remember, and Great Britain
by our requesf and not for any individual interest of
her own admitted it. Now, those who are either the
fool friends or the secret and sinister enemies of the
canal are demanding that we not only fortify and gar
rison the canal, but that we put higher tolls upon
foreign ships than upon our own!
They go farther than this. Supporting Morgan in
his advocacy of breach of faith, they are now de
manding that we order the evacuation of British Hon
duras !
One may well despair of ever seeing an isthmian
canal if these marplots. are to further influence public
opinion by a mixture of lying and jingoism. A canal
built in their way would be an element of weakness
ntber than strength. ' We would have to make it a
citadel, an unreducible fortification, for it would be
our weakest point, our vitals, at which an enemy
would strike first, and to build it in the' way and for
the purpose proposed would raise up ''plenty of ene
mies.
In the light of settled public and international law
such a canal becomes a part of the Atlantic and Pa
cific Oceans, and no one nation has any right to dis
criminate in its use in war or peace. . Â¦
General Cass was something of a statesman in his
day and something of a Democrat. He ran for Presi
dent and was Secretary of State. In a communication
to Lord Napier in 1857 he said: "The United States,
as I have before had occasion to assure your Lordship,
demand no exclusive privileges in these inter
cceanic passages, but will always exert their influence
to secure their free and unresHcted benefits, both 'in
peace and war, to the commerce of the. world."
That was the doctrine of Marcy, Seward, Fish and
Olney, and Mr. Hay stands in line with them. It was
ihe <3octrine of John M. Clayton, who in 1835 began
agitation. for an isthmian canal and made the Bulwer
treaty in line with the statesmen who succeeded him.
To get a right understanding of it, suppose^ nature
had connected the two oceans by a navigable strait
along the line of the proposed canal, would the United
Slates or any other power have presumed to dis
criminate in favor of its own ships in the use of that
natural waterway?
We hope that the people who want the canal will
see plainly that their hope is deferred by a combina
tion between its enemies and the oxidized dema
gogues of the Morgan stripe. If we are ever to see a
canal the public opinion of the country must cease
subjection to such fantastic claims as are made under
pretense that they are necessary to protect American
commerce. It, is -becoming the odium of our politics
that no great work useful to the "world and symboliz
ing our glory can be proposed without bringing to the
front a spirit* of reprehensible and 1 unpatriotic parti
sanship.

\ The members of the Metal Polishers',
Buffers', Platers' and Brass Workers'
Union, who are out on strike for shorter
hours, held 1 an enthusiastic meeting last
night at 1133 Mission street. None of .the
men connected with , this trade has re
turned â¢ to Â¦ work since leaving the | shops
where they were employed Saturday nignt
and they have determined to remain : out
until . the demand , made by . them for
a shorter day without reduction in pay is
acceded to. " - â¢
The men base their claim for a shorter
workday on the fact that their trade is
unhealthy . and â¢ that - the average life of
a mechanic in their business is but ten
years, j This the men say is reason enough'
for such a demand, and as life is sweet
to them : they intend . to â¢ do , all in their
power to secure the consent i of their em
ployers for an eight-hour day at the rate
of wages . now paid for ten hours' work,
f President John D. Hammell of the union
served a notice last Monday on the pro
prietors of the . different shops v where
buffers and polishers and brass workers
are employed. He 'presented to them an.
agreement for their signatures, informing
them that a walk-out would occur unless
it was signed, A week having elapsed
and the proprietors showing no intention
of acceding to the. request of the '.union,
the members quit work. . ' â¢
'At last night's meeting it was reported
that the men working for the following
tirms had .followed tne dictates of thi?
union and struck: -Globe. Brass and Bell
Foundry, J. RoylanCe Brass Works, Gold
en' West Plating Works, San Francisco
Novelty and .Plating Works, Pacific Plat
ing Works, Eagle- Brass 1 , and Machine
Shop, Pacific Plating and Metal Works,
E. G. Dennison, Central Plating WorkÂ«,
Schaezlein & Burridge and the California
Artistic Metal and Â« Wire Company. . Â¦ Â¦ '
The strength of the union is about sev
enty-five members and there are only a
few working at the trade that are not
members. Every shop In the - city re
mained closed yesterday with the excep
tion of that of the J. Roylance Bra3S
Works, which remained' open and endeav
ored to turn -out the work on* hand, with
the aid of two brass workers who are nc;
members of the union. . ' v". ; ':
BASEBALL '; BOYCOTT IS ON.
Entire California League Is Now TJii-
der the Ban of Trades Council.
The relations between ' the Building
Trades Council and the baseball r, mag
nates is still in a strained condition. No
further attempts have -been made to re
store the pleasant relations , existing be
fore -the- recent trouble. . President. Mc-
Carthy said last night the boycott would
become general and was not against Har
ris alone, but would arfect the California
Baseball League. 7 When seen last night
he was wroth at the statements. that had
been .made concerning his share in the
trouble and would talk only of the dam
age that the Building Trades Council in
tendci -causing the baseball managers.
He said: . .:
"This thing will reach mammoth propor

we can reach r Los Angeles and Sacra

ALMTRA S. TOWNSEUTD'S
ESTATE IS DISTRIBUTED
Judge Troutt Orders Decedent's Prop
erties Turned Over to Mrs,
Ella F. Murray.
Judge Troutt has ordered the distribu
tion of the estate of the late Almlra S.
Townsend to her daughter, Ella F. Mur
ray. Under the decree of the court $539,
000 will pass into the control of Mrs.
Murray. Twenty-five thousand dollars
yet remain subject to the jurisdiction of
the court, this being withheld to meet
expenses of probate and to liquidate any
legitimate claims that may arise within
the statutory time within which they may
be presented.
Judge Troutt's action was In accordance
with a decree of the Supreme Court deny
ing the petition of Public Administrator
Boland. presented by Attorney M. C. Has
sett, for a writ of prohibition to restrain
Judge Troutt from proceeding to dis
tribute the estate of the late Mrs. Town
send. The decision apainat Boland and
Hassett was rendered from the bench by
the Supreme Court and Judge Troutt's
order followed.
In consequence, Mrs. Murray, who is the
sole heir of the deceased, took possession
of her heritage late yesterday afternoon.
HAS NO JURISDICTION
IN A HAWAIIAN CASE
Territorial Court Decisions Not Re
view-able by United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals.
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals handed down an opinion yesterday
in the matter of the Wilder Steamship
Company, a Hawaiian corporation, vs. G.
M. Hind and others. The opinion is to
the effect that the court has no Jurisdic
tion and therefore dismisses the appeal.
The following are some of the reasons In
the opinion:
If Congress had established in the Territory
of Hawai'. a system of territorial courts only
an -appeal from the decision of the highest
court of the Territory wdruld, of oouree, be
reviewable in the United Â«5tates Circuit Court
Of Appeals under the provisions of the act.
But in this instance Congress has created two
systems of courts, onÂ« the district court for
the Jurisdiction of Federal causes, the other
lor the trial of all other causes. It has pro
vided specially for an appeal to this court from
the decision of the District Court. It has made
no such provision for appeal from the final
decision of the territorial court, but has enact*
ed a general statute, the intention of which
end the purport of which was to place the
Supreme Court of the Territory upon the basis
of the Supreme Courts of the States In all
matters which concern their relation to the
courts of the United States.
The fact that the present case is a suit in
admiralty and as such would have been within
the Jurisdiction of th- District Court created
by the act if it had been commenced after the
date when the act went into effect cannot
affect the question which is before us. The
eppeal is denied.
United States transport Bu
| ford, the Pacific Mail Company's
1 1 steamship Acapuico and the ship
il Eclipse of the Alaska Packers' As
sociation, all left port together
yesterday. When last seen the Eclipse was
heading toward the Chignik Bay canner
ies, the Buford toward Honolulu en route
to the Philippines, and the Acapulco to
ward Mazatlan en route to Panama.
Th,e Buford took away two troops of ths
First Sauadron of the Fifteenth Cavalry,
one company of the Tenth Infantry and
the depot battalion of the Fifth Infantry.
The mascot of the cavalry/ did not get
away on the transport. He .was held up
on the wharf and turned over to the po
lice, who kept him in custody until after
the Buford sailed. The lad says his name
is Alfred Esparcia and that he was born
in Concord, Contra Costa County, thirteen
years ago. His father died several year3
ago and his mother went to her old home
in San Antonio, Texas. There she died, as
did also the lad's grandmother. Alfred
determined to strike out for himself and
when the Fifteenth Cavairy was ordered
to San Francesco he attached himself to
one of the companies as a maecot His
desire is to reach the Philippines and
there he is going to get by hook or crook.
Among those who went awav in the
cabin of the Buford were four Judges for
the Philippine courts created by the Taft
commission." They are J.' F. Cooper of
Fort Worth, Texas, and Chas. A. Willard
of Minneapolis, who will be judges of the
Supreme Court of the Philippines, and
Fletcher Ladd of Lancaster, N. H., and
W A. Kincaid of Galveston, Tex., who
will be judges of the Court of First In
stance. Others who went away on the
transport were:
Congressman E. B. Hill, en route to Manila;
Congressman Horace B. Packer and John K.
Souther, for Honolulu; Commander Theodore
Porter. TJ. S. N.; Captain Elmer S. Tennly,
Captain Gerry S. Driver, Captain Ernest H.
AVheeler, Captain Henry M. Hall, Mrs. Kerr.
Mrs. Kneedler, Mrs. Bowman, Mrs. Trott, Mrs.
Campbell, Mrs. Ames, Mrs. Partelle, Mrs.
Driver and Mrs. Wheeler. Judges Cooper and
Ladd are accompanied by their wives and
families.
The Eclipse got her Chinese yesterday
morning and Captain Larsen lost no time
in getting to sea. She was to have sailed
Sunday, but the Chinese, who were en
gaged for the canneries, did not show. up,
so the shlD could not leave her berth.
The Acapulco only took away about halt
a dozen passengers and' a small â¢ quantity
of frel&ht. In spite of the cut in rates the
merchants are -staying with the Kosmos
and other opposition lines, and very little
Central American freight is going on tho
mall boats.
MENACE TO NAVIGATION.
Buoys and Anchor Chains Should Be
Removed by Government.
Captains of coasting vessels and tow
boats are complaining because wreckers
have left a number of buoys at Point Bo
nita and Fort Point. At the fo-mer place
they were laid down to mark the position
of the wreck of the City of New York, and
at Fort Point to show where the Rio de
Janeiro was supposed to have rone down.
In this instance the Buoys with their tons
of anchors and_chains are not anywhere
near the wreck, but still they are kept
there to the disgrust of everybody who
brings a coaster in from the south. ! .
At Point Bonita the buoys are in a still
worse position and It will -not surprise
anybody if some day they are cut adrift
and the chain allowed to sink.- They hav*e
been there for years, and as Uncle Sam is
the only one who has any authority in ths
matter, It Is about time some of his of
ficials had them, removed.
Reinsurance on Overdue Fleet.
The underwriters do not Beem to know
just where they stand In regard to some
of the overdue fleet. Some of the" vessels
are undoubtedly lost, but many more
that carried heavy reinsurance have
reached port than have disappeared. Yes
terday the Eaton Hall, 106 days from Ta
coma for Callao, arrived at Valparaiso.
The underwriters paid S5 per- cent to rein
sure their risks on her.
The John McDonald is now out 196 days
from Baltimore for San Francisco, and
the Ardnamurchan, 127 days from Fraser
River, B. C, for Liverpool. Friday last
the John McDonald was at . 50 per cent,
Saturday she had advanced to 60 per cent,
and yesterday she was at 65 per cent. The
Ardnamurcnan has been up to 65 per cent
and down to 50 per cent, on three "occa
sions. Friday last the rate was 65 per
cent, Saturday it had dropped to 50 per
cent, and yesterday the best offer was 40
per cent. The chances are that the under
writers have heard some reassuring: news
about the salmoi shin. The Fullwood,
now out SO days from Hongkong for
Portland, is still at 15 per cent.
"Water Front Notes.
The Marlposa will be. due' tomorrow and
the Zealandia Fridav from Honolulu. The
majority of the Mystic ShrinerB will come
back on these vessels.
The Curacao went on the drydock yes
terday. She sails for Mexican rrorts next
Sunday. The Arequlpa ?s also scheduled
to sail on that date, but as she will ' not
get here before next Thursday, the
chances are that it will be the 9th inst. be
fore she departs for Central and Soutn
American j?orts. Â¦
Walter Carter was charged with grand
larceny at the Harbor police station yes
terday. Several days ago Amanda How
ard of 420 Sixth street was in the saloon
at 236 East, street. She had her nurse in
her hand, when a voung: man ran in and
snatched it away. Amanda asserted thera
was over $100 in the puise. Yesterday Sa
loon Keeper McVey recognized the thief
on the water front and x.oUOed.Uie police,
who captured Carter after a long chase.
The prisoner denies snatching the wo
man's purse. :. ;-.:'v ,--- ; M-.

TRANSPORT BUFORD WITH SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS FOR MANILA, ACAPULCO FOR CENTRAL AMERICAN
PORTS AND SHIP ECLIPSE FOR THE CANNERIES DEPARTING FROM SAN FRANCISCO.
There was excitement In the wholesale
district yesterday. Hard words were said,
lists were shaken and the official guar
dians of the city's streets were called
upon to stop the Market-street railway
from laying tracks. The Board of Public
Works sent a policeman down to the
junction of Sansome and Busli streets to
prevent the workmen employed by the
street railway system prosecuting their
labors at that point. Murphy, Grant & Co.
were the principal complainants, but the
other merchants in the vicinity were in
terested and coiitribulted to a very spir
ited conversation fhat lasted from morn
ing- until the policeman told the men to
stop track laying.
Before this was accomplished Bush
street, just east of Sansome, was practi
cally filled with tracks. In addition to
one "track that previously existed, two
new ones, curving in from Sansome street
from the north, were in evidence. These
were laid between the time Murphy,
Grant & Co. closed their doors Saturday
night last and the hour of reopening yes
terday morning. At the curve the inner
track was less than three feet from the
curb.
"The law," said C. D. Haven, of Mur
phy, Grant & Co., "provides that no tract
shall be laid within ten feet of the curb,
but this one is within thirty inches. It
shuts us out of loading teams. If noth
ing can be done Murphy, Grant & Co.
might as well close. We have appealed
to the Board of Public Works and it has
stopped the work. We hope to have the
matter adjusted directly."
Late In the aiternoon the attorneys. for
the Market-street Railway Company, the
Board of Works and Murphy, Grant & Co.
held a conference at the City Hall with a
view toward adjusting: the difficulty. At
torney Gartland for the board stated that
the laying of the tracks within thirty
Inches of the curb was clearly in viola
tion of the ordinance which granted J;he
franchise. The ordinance provides that the
tracks shall not be built within eleven
feet of either curb. It was finally decided
to construct the curve on a single track,
after the ultimatum of the Board of Pub
lic Works to tear up tracks laid in vio
lation of the ordinance had been an
nounced to the attorneys of the street
railway company.
While the controversy was at its height
a dray was placed," by order of Murphy,
Grant & Co.. on Sansome street, close to
>he corner, and a man was directed to
stay there to see that the vehicle was not
removed. Cars could not pass that place
at the hour of closing business last night.
Th<=" dray still held the fort unmolested
a; the sentinel stood at his post.

Single commission houses to-day did a suf

EASTERN MARKETS:
CHICAGO, April 1â The advancing tendency
of the corn market which has been shown In
an aggressive I manner in the past few days
received a sharp check. ' but broke only after
a desperate resistance. May opened with sell
ers all the way from 44V&C to 45c, the lnfluV
ences aside from the desire from profits being
favorable weatjier, liberal receipts, including a
good proportion of contract corn and indiffer
ent cables. , Philips bought liberally . and was
trailed by country interests as usual. This
support held the market all forenoon against
the liquidating pressure. May reacted from
44c to 4 4 Vic, and held close under that figure
until noon. Long corn was then offered with
great freedom. May dropping to 43Â»'gc, closing
weak, l@l%c under Saturday at 43V2C.
The withdrawal of the corn' support, which
has been the mainstay of wheat bulls for
some time, had a serious effect on that nat
urally bearish market. May wheat opened
%(gi%c lower at 75%75%c under, the influence
of weak cables, decidedly bearish world's
statistics, liberal receipts . and good weather.
Buying by a corn bull caused an early rally
to 75%C For . a time the market ruled .stag

supply showed an Increase, the market broke
to ~*V*c. The close was weak. May l%c lower

was very actively dealt In at an extreme rise
â¢ Money market conditions were entirely ig
nored In the eager speculative spirit. Although
Government internal ! disbursements i are ex
pected to yield over $3,000,000 to the money
market to-morrow, the absorption of cash by
the. Sub-Treasury on routine operations con
tinues very large. Sterling exchange advanced
a fraction to the gold export point to-day on
the large demand, from stock houses, who are
buying American: stocks abroad. After the
stock market had closed a $500,000 gold shipment
to Europe for to-morrow was announced and
more is expected to go during the week. The
tone of the money market was distinctly
harder, but not the slightest effect was pro
duced on the speculation. Conjecture was at a
loss to account for the heavy concentrated
celling of the United Â¦ Staes Steel stocks, but
there was a suggestion that it was due to the
purchase of an interest amounting to several
million dollars 'which the syndicate under
writers had agreed, to sell, .but had decided to
pass through the open market.
The bond market was not active relatively
as the stock market, but business was small
and the movement of prices Irregular.
Total sales, $6,035,000.- United States 3s and
new 4s declined M per cent on the last call.

NEW. YORK, April 1.â There was a better
feeling obtained for spelte^ in the local metal
market to-day.' Prices advanced about 5 points
in face of a loss of 2s 6d for that metal in
London, on light export Inquiry and a lack
of sellers. The close was firm at $3 90@3 95.
The , exports of copper ,. for the month of
March was 6624 tons, thus indicating a heavy
decrease for the first quarter of this year, the
exports for the latter being only 24,050 ton?,
against 44,679 last year. The local copper mar
ket was dull but steady at about unchanged
prices on the basis of $17 for lake and $16 62vi
for casting.- At London a decline of 9s 3d was
reported; spot closed at Â£69 and futures at Â£63

In London tin was 12s 6d lower The â¢ local
market dropped about 50 points in synipathy
with the .loss ' abroad, â¢ but traders exhibited
little -disposition to do business at any figure.
The close was quiet but firm at $26@26 50. , The
visible supply of tin increased 1040 tons dur
ing the. past month. Lead . was without quot
able change and - very. dull. Iron, while dis
playing . a steady undertone, was inactive and

A conference committee to consult with
the , Council regarding ways and means
of keeping the High Schools open was ap
pointed to report at the special, meeting
Thursday night. It is composed of G. T.
Randolph." chairman;" F. L. Button and
Giles H. Gray. , : Â¦:. . . , - ;-.
Â¦ board took up the consideration of
fin. 3 and a special meeting was called
for Thursday night to attempt a solution
of the problem of funds for the remainder
of the school year. The new members
were Informed that the deficit in the
school fund had compelled the Council,
as. a temporary expedient, to appropriate
during the last week of Its existence an
emergency fund of $4113 to run the High,
Schools until the new board and the new
Council should take office, and that there
fore the board goes into office face to face
with a pressing need of money. It was
explained that unless the money could be
raised by the end of the week the High
Schools could not be kept open.
The estimated expense of running them
to the end of the school #year is about
$15,000.
Director Giles H. Gray addressed the
board on the financial crisis. "We must
Â¦be ready by Friday," he said, "to tell. the
High School principals whether they are
to shut up the schools or not. I under
stand that the new Council is disposed to
take measures to afford us relief, but they
are just now laboring under considerable
excitement and are not in a position to
calmly consider the school situation. As
soon as they are sure of their seats they
will be ready, no doubt, to propose a
remedy. Â¦ Â¦â¢Â¦ . â¢ Â¦ .-.
"I would suggest the following solution
for the problem: There is a deficit in the
city treasury of $38,000. Now let the city
refuse to pay its water bills, amounting
to $33,000. until a judgment is rendered in
the water-rate suit; then let the salaries
of the statutory officers also run over into
the next fiscal year. That .will leave a
balance in .the treasury amply large for
our needs. " This expedient will give the
new city government time to devise meas
ures of permanent relief.; 1

Judge Ogden took the case under ad

agreed to submit it en Briefs.
"Mrs. Wakefield had on a life preserver
and the body was warm. Fifteen minutes
sooner and her life might have been
saved. I reached the cccne of the wreck
at about half past eight. Steaming about
among the wreckage and floating bodies
of dead Chinese we came across the bodv
of a white woman scantily clothed, ana
floating face downward." It was the
corpse afterward identified as that of
Mrs. Wakefield. When we took it from
the water it was so warm that we imme
diately went to work applying restora
tives. After working for some time we
gave* it up. Fifteen minutes before, I
think, she must have been alive. When
we saw that she was pa&t help we laid the
body on the deck and covered it with tho
United States flag. When found, Mn.
Wakefleld had a life-preserver about her
neck."

their mad struggle for life.
The witness said he saw the Wakenelds,
mother and daughter, clinging together at
the vessel's rail as she went down. Gusen
blodt himself was earned down by the
suction far below the surface. He was
bruised and cut by tne wreckage, bat
clung to a spar until picked up by a fish
erman. He did not see either Mrs. Wake
field or her daughter after- the Rio sank.
To offset the evidence Introduced by tla
petitioners for letters of administration
upon tlie daughter's estate, the Public Ad
ministrator, who seeks to prove that Mrs.
Wakefleld survived her daughter, intro
duced the testimony of the captain of tho
tug which found the mother's body, as
proof that Mrs. Wak^field lived for houra
after the steamer was wrecked.
At the hearing of the case last week
several of Miss Waketield's friends tesli
iied that she was an expert swimmer, and
on this ground Judge Ogcen was asked, to
render a decision declaring that the young
lady was the survivor. '*- â¢-,
According to the testimony of" Captain
David Shaw, who took Mrs. Wakeneld'a
body from the water, it would appear that
the contrary was the case. Captain Shaw
said:
Widow Is Given Judgment
A decision was rendered yesterday
afternoon by Judge Hunt, by the terms
of which Annie Courtois, widow of the
late G. M. V. Courtois, was given judg
ment against the Ancient Order of United
Worklngmen for $2000, the face value pf
a policy on the life of the deceased. The
order did not dispute the fact that the
sum named was due on the policy, but
asked the court to decide to whom the
sum should be paid, on the gTound that a
claim to the same .was filed by Emile
Courtois, a former wife of the deceased,
and from . whom he had been divorced.
Emile Courtois was named in the policy
as the beneficiary, but the court held that
upon the issuance of the decree of divorce
she lost all claim upon the policy issued
to her former husband, the deceased. .

the subject of denunciation by the Rev.

touch of pathos in. the proceedings, due
to the sorrowful comment. of several of

was introduced by the. historical commit

have spoken in terms of condemnation of
the pioneers, were denounced, in turn.
This committee consisted of S. W. Hol
laday, Willard B. Farwell, Dr. Charles D.
Cleveland, Almarin B.Paul and Edward
E. Cheever. When their scathing report
had been read and the society had voted
to have it published entire as a pamphlet,

fcpoke.
Foremost among those to make remarks
was the Rev. Dr. Willey, who was chap
lain of the first constitutional convention
< ;f California at Monterey, at which place
ne arrived in 1849. He came to San Fran
cisco in 1850, and traveled all over the
State in early days. His tribute to the
women of California was warm.' "They
were a glory to womanhood itself," he de
clared, while other pioneers applauded.
"They were self-denying, brave home
makers. They did not complain. They
were true to their husbands. They were
founders of churches, schools and other
institutions. Many were highly educated
and came from the most I refined society
In the East. Their lives enriched their
generation. . The bad women were few
and were not an element in pioneer days."

Coal Oil Killed Off the Mosquitoes.
Winchester is the name of a town in
Virginia and it has been somewhat cele
brated in song and story, because one
Sheridan once rode around in that neigh
borhood, creating considerable commo
tion. It has lived on that reputation ever
since, but now it has been doing some
thing on its own account to secure fame.
Its people had read in the newspapers
that kerosene oil properly applied would
kill mosquitoes. They knew of their own
knowledge and experience what an ugly
thing a Virginia mosquito Is and how
viciously it bites. They had read, fur
thermore, in the newspapers that mos
quitoes carry malaria, and other diseases
and that, altogether, they aro very* ob
jectionable insects. Accordingly the Town
Council took the matter in hand and
passed an ordinance requiring the owners
of all ponds and pools anywhere in thÂ©
neighborhood to pour crude petroleum on
the waters. It went further ac<l required
â¢ every householder to put tubs of water,
on the surface of which there was a good
ly supply of petroleum, under all the>
shrutbery. This experiment was made last
summer and it finished the mosquitoes. It
also finished the malaria and struck a
death blow at the quinine business." So
successful were they last year that they
are going to do the same thing next
spring. Winchester's success la this di
rection should incite other mosquito in
fested places to rise up and da likewise.
The residents of New Jersey ia particu
lar should take note of the "Winchester
example and follow it right awmy quick.â

is withdrawn-
Supervisor Braunhart introduced, at the
request of . the' street railway companies,
an ordinance to the Board of Supervisors
yesterday, designed to prevent and pun
ish frauds upon street railroads in con
nection with the "pupils* two and a half
cent' fare bill." The ordinance, which
was referred to the Judiciary Committee,
provides as follows:
Any person who Shall falsely represent him
self or herself to be thereunto entitled, and
any person entitled to the benefit of the re
duced rates of fare as provided in ordinance
221 who shall transfer to any other person not
so entitled any ticket or other evidence oÂ£
his or her right to travel at the reduced rates
Of fare, shall be deemed guilty of a misde
meanor,' and upon conviction, shall be punished
by a fine not exceedingly one hundred dollars
<?100),.or by imprisonment in the County Jail
not exceeding flity (SC) days, j or by both such
fine and imprisonment.
The Sutter-street Railway Company and
the Sutrc road informed the board that
they would submit to the ordinance pro
viding for a two and a half cent fare for
pupils, but reserve the right to test the
constitutionality of : the ordinance.
Secretary Clayton of the San Francisco
and San Mateo Railway Company notified
the board that while the board of direc
tors believed the two and a half cent
fare ordinance a clear evasion of the legal
rights of the company, it intends to adopt
regulations similar to the ordinance to
go into effect on April 15. The directors,
however, reserve the right to suspend
these regulations should they deem it
necessary, owing to abuse of the privilege
or other cause. In making this reserva
tion they intend to concede the privilege
In abroad spirit, with the sincerest in
tensions to' spare no effort to make it a
success. ; . . . . ." ......... ...
An expenditure of $6000 was authorized
out of the urgent necessity fund to place
Chinatown In a sanitary condition; also
$3000 for the extension of the Twenty
sixth-street Hospital.
The ordinance transferring a lot adjoin
ing the Girls' High School for use as a
site whereon to erect the San Francisco
State Normal School was- indefinitely
postponed. The passage of the ordinance
was contingent on the. adoption of a bill
by tho Legislature appropriating $100,000
for the building, which bill the Governor
vetoed.
The Mayor called the attention of the
board to the fact that it would be neces
sary to appropriate the sum of $111,000 to
complete the work of Improving Dewey
Boulevard, in accordance with the agree
ment with the Sutro estate. If the work
is not finished in March, 1902, the 100 feet
right of way will revert to the Sutro es

Grand Jurors Recommend
Increase in License for
Street Cars.
Eureka Valley Residents Want Eight-
Boom Schoolliouse â Valley Road j
Is Granted Franchise on
Illinois Street.
Â» .
Grand Jurors Dunn and Badcer are or
the opinion that the existing license tax
on street cars is entirely too low. In a'
communication filed with the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday they request that the
ordinance imposing a license of $15 per an
num on each street railroad passenger car
be amended to read as follows:
All cars between 33 and 40 feet lone shall pay
a license of flOO per annum; 30 and 35 feet
long, J90 per annum; 25 and 30 feet long, ISO
per annum; 20 and 25 feet long, $70 per annum.
"Computing the above," the petition
says, "the daily charge upon said cars will
be approximately ,2TH, 24 2-3, 22 end 16'*
cents each. The original order applied to
horse cara and was enacted in 1S68. The
cars of the lines then. In evidence were of
small size, capable of carrying about
thirty passengers' each, while some of tha
cars now In operation can accommodate
four times that number. The license of
$15 per annum la grossly an under chargo
as compared with that imposed on hack
ney carriages and witu other vehicle li
censes."
The petition was referred to the License
Committee. , -
The City Attorney was requested to fur
nish an opinion whether the Tax Collect â¢
or may charge $3 per 100 names for com
piling the so-called military roll: also
whether his official salaiy is not a full
compensation for all services he may per
form in his official capacity.
The petition of the Eureka Valley prop
erty-owners and residents for the pur-
Chase of a site and the erection thereon of
an eight-class-room school building in
the vicinity of Eighteenth and Danvers
streets, was referred to the Finance Com
mittee.
The members of the Grand Jury, in a
written communication, lecommended tha
appointment of Jo Gordan aa an expert
accountant for the checking off and veri
fication of fees collected under the pres
ent system.
The ordinance authorizing the appoint
ment of fifteen additional police officers
was not passed on recommendation of tha
Police Committee.
The ordinance granting: a franchise to
the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railroad on Illinois street, near Marin,
southerly to Kentucky- and Q streets
south, thence to Fifteenth avenue south.,
was finally passed.
The ordinance prohibiting the publica
tion of lottery lists was finally passed.
Rev. WVH. -RatclifT, \>astor of the Church
of the Advent, Hied a written protest
against the passage of the ordinance. In
his communication Dr. Katcliff says;
"I am opposed to such restrictive legis
lation, first, as against liberty; second, thÂ»
impropriety of lotteries is doubtful â many
churches permit thorn in their bazaars:
third, if the law steps in. concealed meth
ods* would be adopted: fourth, the slow
but healthy growth of public opinion will
eventually stop all that is injurious; fifth,
the State's prime duty is to stop injustice,
robbery, holdings up, fraud, etc. It should
not fritter away Its time and strength on
minor matters till thld primary duty is
fully performed. Tha States's duty is to
protect men against others, not against
their own action."
SUPERVISORS AT LAST ADOPT
PHELAN'S WATER ORDINANCE
No Reductions Are Made in
the Rates Charged to
Consumers.
- â¢.:Â¦ : â¢-
Â¦Futile Effort to Raise Allowance for
Hydrant Service in Order to Se
cure Increased Fire Pro-
The Board jot Supervisors after^ numer
ous attempts finally passed the" 1 Phelan
water-rate ordinance yesterday. The or
dinance was immediately signed, by. the
Mayor and is now a. law. The measure
makes no reduction to consumers, -but re
duces the allowance paid for hydrant ser
vice from $222,000 to $80,000 Per year. The
specious promise" is held out by Phelan's
board that the difference of $142,000 will
be expended for public improvements.
When the ordinance was taken up Tobln
moved to amend that in lieu of a flat
rate of $80,000 per annum tor hydrants
$15,000 per month or $180,000 per annum be
allowed the company. Tobin asked the
representatives of the company If, the
sum. of $465,000 would be expended for new
mains if the $15,000 per month were al
lowed..* Attorney Kellogg replied that his
company would comply with the exaction
if its taxes were not greater than $196,000.
Kellogg said he would file a new agree
ment to that effect in place of the one
calling- for $18,500 per month.
Braunhart, who acted as spokesman for
the Mayor, opposed the amendment on tho
ground that it. would add $36,000 to the
revenue of the company. He contended
that the City Attorney ' had not advls^il
that the city could not compel the com
pany to lay new water mains.. He held
further that it. was illegal to enter into
any agreement requiring the company to
expend $465,000 for the laying of mains.'
Connor made a plea for the Phelan ordi
nance and said the rates had been based
on a fixed valuation of the Spring Valley
plant and the ordinance could not- bt>
amended without changing that valuation.
He thought it a poor excuse to raise the
revenue because Chief Sullivan had rec
ommended better fire protection.,
Fire Protection .Inadequate. ;
Reed argued that the 'city is in dire need
of fire protection and that was the only
justification for Tobin's amendment. Reed
held that it was a strong Indictment of
the company that it had not provided ade
quate fire protection, for the city. Brana
enstein said that the valuation of the
plant was a mere conjecture, according to
the City Engineer, and the board shoul.l
be generous in its allowances to the com
pany. Â¦ Connor produced figures to show
that the city was not suffering for lack
of fire protection. ,. , ' â¢ ,* - t l
McCarthy said that he had often wit
nessed engines with steam up standing
Idle - at hydrants because they . could not
get water therefrom. : . .
"Rather than pay $142,000 to the -water
company," said McCarthy, "for spending
$465,000, let the city itself expend the
money in putting in the new mains. I am
in sympathy with Supervisor Reed s ordi
nance, which gives the -company 5 : per
cent on a valuation of $20,000,000." .
"Not one citizen has come before this
board " said Tobin,* "and made complaint
that he was being overcharged for water,
and in view of that fact and the conten
tion of the Spring Valley Company that
it will be unfairly treated by giving it only
J80 000 a year for hydrants, I believe In in
creasing that allowance." â¢

" LONDON, April 1.â In the House, of

Mr. Chamberlain, confirming the dispatch
from Accra, Gold Coast Colony, announc
ing 1 that a -number of men belonging to
the British West African regiment who
deserted at Kumassi had marched, armed,
to Cape Coast Castle, where it was' feared
they would loot the town, said that 'be-*

C-amberlain Tells the House of Com-
WEST AFBICAlSn FIGHTEBS
- LEAVE BRITISH FORCES
The case ' referred to. In the dispatch
from London has been known as trie King
versus Cockerton. It was an appeal by
William H. J.: Scott Lidgett and
George- Sepmnus -Warmington from the
judgment Â¦ of the Divisional Â»Court. . The
London School Board was the real appel
lant, and the case raised the very im
portant question- -whether the School
Board was justified ta paying out of the
funds raised bf rates the expenses of the
science and; art classes in- the day schools
and evening continuation schools. â¢ ~
The: local government board auditor ap
pointed, to audit the .accounts- of the
School Board for the half-year ended Sep
tember '29, 1S98, had disallowed and sur
charged three separate sums which had
been expended upon the maintenance Â¦ of
classes registered i under : the science and
art' department. A rule for a certiorari
to bring up and quash the certificates of
the auditor disallowing and surcharging
these three sums had been obtained at the
instance of the appellants, --who are mem
bers of the School Â¦ Board of London, and
upon each of whom one of thethree sums
in question had been surcharged. For the
purposes of the argument of the rule the
facts were- stated- in the'form of a special
case, pursuant to an - order of the court

' THE SULTAN'S CEREMONY
NEW' YORK, April 1.â The Commercial
Advertiser /says: Â¦ A semi-official ai:-.
nouricement was made to-dav that - . the
Lehlgh Valley railroad had been turned
over to . the Philadelphia and Readins
Company arid will hereafter form part of
the Reading: system, which also Includes
the Jersey Central Railrcad. . ,
-j.- P. "Morgan has been the dominating
influence in Lehigh Valley affairs for sev
eral years, but it. was only recently that
he came Into full control of the property.
THls control he Is said to have secured by
the purchase of the Lehigh Valley shares
held by the . Asa Packer estate. At the
time of that transaction a report obtained
credence in Wall street that the Lehieh
Valley road would be madi* part of. the
Erie system. Â¦ .. . ,
The absorption of the .Lehigh Valley by
the Reading system restores the tri
partite combination which' was made by
Archibald McLeod about ten yeara ago
when he -undertook to amalgamate the
Reading, Jersey Centrai and Lehljrh Val
ley railroads. This combination proved too
unwieldly at that time. .
Announcement Is Made That the Line
Will Hereaf tsr Be Faft of the

Lombard Street Barn Burned.
A fire was discovered In a barn belong
ing to Peter Chali, at 1534 Lombard street,
shortly after 8 o'clock last night. There
was delay in ringing In an alarm and by
the time the fire department arrived on
the scene. the building had been almost
destroyed. A high wind was blowing at
the time and had there been other build
ings in the vicinity there would have been
danger of a conflagration. A quantity of
hay was burned in the barn, together with
about 200 chickens which were confined in
a shed -adjoining. An investigation dis
closed the fact that a large quantity of
coal oil had been spread in the vicinity of
the building and the inference was that
the fire was of incendiary origin.
The syndicate that has arranged to
lease the hotel to be erected on the old
Calvary-Church site .from the Crocker
heirs will incorporate within the next two
or three days. The names of the parties
have been kept secret, but all the facts
must â¢iome out when the lease and arti
cles of incorporation are placed on record.
M. H. Hecht, Louis Sloss and Lewis Gers
tle are among those, concerned. . All the
members of the syndicate' are local capi
talists. They will Incorporate with a paid
up capital of $250,000, all of which will be
expended for furniture for the hotel. The
lease will be for ten j-ears. -. While there
is no present agreement concerning the
date when the hotel shall be ready for
occupany, the understanding is that it
will be handed over to the syndicate not
later than the summer of 1902.
The agreement concerning the hotel
building is that it shall be the best that
can be built for money. It will be eleven
stories high and will cover the entire lot.
which has 137:6 feet frontage on Powell
street and 165 feet on Geary. The mate
rials will be marble, terra cotta and red
brick, the framework being of steel. The
cost is variously estimated, but it ..will
be somewhere between $1,000,000 and $1.
500,000. Within the last few days some
changes have been suggested in the plans,
to which Messrs. Green and Scott, the
trustees of the Crocker heirs, have agreed'.
These will not affect the general plan.
The general shape will be that of a letter
H, to insure all outside rooms. There
will be no stores in the structure, which
will be solely devoted to hotel purposes.
The rooms will number 360. All rooms
will be provided with baths," tele
phone and electric lights. Forty private
sitting-rooms will be included. On the
ground floor will be a large cafe, in addi
tion to the general dining-room. The main
cafe will front on Powell street and will
be 40x90 feet in dimensions. It is agTeed
that everything shall be modern In all re
spects, the best that can be provided, the
purpose being to make this the best hotel
in the world if possible. Drawings are
now being prepared. . >>?.'<â¢Â¦Â¦;

District Attorney Byington was awfully
shocked by Sullivan's assertion that any
one of his clerks should be concerned in
a grafting proposition.
"I'll fire every . ono of. them," he de
clared, "if this accusation Is proven. . I've
told these/boys time and again that they
are getting big salaries and they must do
their work. My office is worked night and
day, but they've got to stand it."
'Byington declared that he had visited
the warrant .'and bona clerk's office fully
a hundred times during, the tenure of his
incumbency and while he nad never mada
an expert examination of the books' he
had made a cursory one. The Grand Jury
.will probably do -the rest. "
- After' Kytkals- dissertation on ' handwrit
ing Judges Conlan and Cabaniss declared
that their signatures had been forged.
Deputy '.Treasurer Reis, who handles all
these warrants -. and pays .out the coin,
looked. ' sheepish and apparently appre
ciated his. uncomfortable position.
-Were. It not for Reis' apparent-discom
fiture,'Â¦Sullivan's Insouciance- and the
presence, of former Chief of. Police Lees,
who is ajiersonal friend of the Reis fam
ily, it might have be<:n a happy gathering.
Â¦Knowing -the genuine signatures of the
'four, policy judges, hundreds of which pass
through his hands every week, Reis failed
to make a.proper explanation of why he
paid out the money, especially to a.man
whose, record is known. to everybody. ever
connected -vwith the City t Hall. It was
harder for Reis- than for Sullivanâ that
hour at police headquarters. . Â¦
Sullivan's Statement.
Here' is. Sullivan's statement to Captain
Seymour as reported by the police stenog
rapher:- -Â¦Â¦: Â¦Â¦ '. Â¦ . â¢Â¦Â¦ .. i ' â¢â¢/â¢â¢â¢"

me to make -any statement or anything. I am
willing to say what I said thenâ that I had the
money for those people and got my percentage
out of ' it, â¢ anything they wanted to give me.

Will Be Charged With Forgiiry. \
-Sullivan rested last- night. In f the City
Prison. ,' Some Â¦ time to-day Â¦ he "-will-, he
charged with*- forgery., oil Â¦ complaint . of
Judge Cabaniss. The prisoner does not
mind. He has made a statement, and,
despite the cross-questioning he wag sub
jected to, he stuck to the main points of
his Â¦ probable defense. . - .
How Sullivan came to be apprehended
was a brilliant stroke of detective work.
Early yesterday morning he sent the fol
lowing dispatch:
COLFAX, Cal.
â¢ Charles F.- Peery, Warrant and Bond Clerk.
Hall of Justice, San Francisco: If anything
out of the ordinary occurs, wait till I return.
1 D. m. Will explain. â¢ Make no report till
then. ' - - â¢ â¢ DAN.
This was followed a few minutes later
by the following: .
". ;'"Â¦ ' Â¦- r COLF AX," Cal.. : April 1.. 1301.
1 W- P. Sullivan Jr., Chief Police, San Fran
cisco: Party bought ticket . San Francisco.
Took No. 3, 6:05 a. m.,' to-day.
- ... W. O. SPENCER.
When he reached - police headquarters
Sullivan was met by Peery, - who took
him into a corner and held a whispered
conversation with him. Then Peery hid
himself for the rest of the" day. All ef
forts, to find him later were unavailing.
He declared immediately after his con
versation with* Sullivan that everything
was all right in his office. . -
Several of the cases of those whose ball
money Sullivan cashed in are pending in
the â¢ various departments of the Police
Court to which they were assigned^ How
he worked the game Sullivan is not dis
posed to tell. Of the money he received
on Saturday, he says he paid $50 to the
clerk of Judge Mogan's court, Conway.
Neither. Judge Mogan. nor his clerk had
answered the summons to appear at po
lice headquarters up to a late hour- last
night. "- ,
Signatures Almost Perfect.
"Judges Conlan. and Cabaniss, when
shown the alleged' fraudulent warrants,
denied emphatically that they had ever
signed them. The" signatures to 'the war
rants from Judge iConlan's court were so
perfect that,; the f Judge would not dispute
them until .after.^'ag'close examination.
Kytka-, c!aimedt**that* the: work' was the
most perfect;he.ihad,eyer^seen from the
hand of one whcJU-was, not 'a. professional
forger.-. .:;;.;.' xf.'.tys ~
The only 'salient, difference between tho
forgery Â¦ and .'Judge ; Conlan'a .. own signa
ture was a .'peculiar r'dowrr stroke in .the
formation of the last letter of the name.
J. P. RiceV clerk in Judge Conlan's court,
was asked if he had signed the disputed
orders. , He replied,- after an examination,
that -he. had- not. . lie was aaked to pro
duce the book in which the accounts for
money deposited as bail were kept. An
examination ,of this book- disclosed the
fact that the: bondsmen , named on the
fraudulent warrants "had -never, signed re
ceipts for the return of their money. The
rule of the court demands that suth pay
ments must be receipted. 'j. 1 .
*In the. case of Ella Thomas the forged
warrant showed that she. was charged
with vagrancy. The court records showed
that she was charged. with disturbing the
peace.' Another discrepancy was discov
ered, in .the numbering of the fraudulent
documents, p The > forged warrants were
shown -also to have been tilled, out on a
form unlike that which is at present used
-Judge Mogan and' Judge Fritz have not
as yet passed upon-their signatures whicn
appear In the irregular warrants. Kytka
declares there -.-- is .Â¦ no doubt that they
have been â¢ forged.' " â¢ Â¦Â¦'Â¦: . Â¦â¢Â¦ â¢
â¢s Judge Cabaniss - stated publicly yester
day afternoon that he never had signed
his name- to a blank warrant. In an in
terview last jiight he flatly contradicted
himself -by stating that it was customary
for him: to sign -as many, as eight or ten'
6f, such blank: warrants at a time as a
matter of convenience. The- same prac
tice, it Â¦ is. said, is followed by all the
Judges. The. warrants can be handed up
by the clerk and are signed as a matter
of accommodation.
Â¦-If Sullivan .confesses after he get'
through Seymour's sweatbox some inter
es ting things mayhappen in the Treas
urers; and District -Attorney's offices. Â¦

livan was well known/ he was employed
by Warrant and Bond Clerk Charles S.
Peery, an appointee of District Attorney
Byington, as his bookkeeper. .When Peeiy
was too busy or indisposed," -he .'allowed
Sullivan to go Xo the city treasury and
straighten out the dailj* cash transactions
of his ofllce. Sullivan made out the dailv
reports, because r he "was such a good pen
man and' expert" bookkeeper. Â¦ . Â¦ : .
Â¦ F'amiliar with all the" routine ' of l Peery*s
office and the police courts, Sullivan saw
a chance to do a little, grafting. Â¦ ; : Â¦ .
"Every one around. the office was doinsr
it," said Sullivan to District Attorney
Byington in Captain Seymour's office yes
terday afternoon, - "and- "whv I should not
do the same thing I do not know."
This candid avowal staggered the Dis
trict Attorney, and- he has promised' .to
make an "investigation." â¢ â¢ â¢ y.
Peculiar Business Methods.
â¢ Ever since the new charter went into ef
fect affairs in the .warrant clerk's office
have been at sixes and sevens. . Bail
money was received andrbalances struck
by cashing orders before the City'Treas
urer ever -handled the coin..' The orders
were accepted as cash,- and- the -formula
of putting the. transactions .through the
books was duly observed. \ But in this
loose way of doing business Sullivan saw
his opportunity and failed not .to profit
thereby. Â¦ Cashier C. B. Perkins' and Dep
uty Treasurer Reis generally handled the
papers and coin. The latter Â¦ does not
know just where he stands in ".the matter.
For some weeks past Sullivan has ap
parently been endeavoring with the as
sistance of others as yet unknown to'
make a clean-up. Orders for the payment
out of the city treasury of large sums of
money have been promiscuously handed
about. One of these was for' $1640. for
Chinese bail money, which was drawn .out
from Judge Cabaniss' court on March 15,
before the order releasing the bail. money
was signed. by..the Judge of that depart
ment. . . , ....
Cabaniss Repudiates Signature.
John J. Greeley, a youthful attache of
the warrant clerk's office, made out bail
bonds for the appearance of the Chinese,
whose sponsor put up the money. There
was some informality in the description
of. the property, and then Joseph F. Cof
fey. attorney, for the Chinese, appeared
upon the scene. Coffey secured the re
lease of the men and Greeley lost his per
quisite. Sullivan drew, the money from
the city treasury on an old-style with
drawal blank, without number, which was
in vogue before- the charter went into ef
fect.. It was purported to tÂ»e signed by
George H. Cabaniss, but the latter dis
putes the genuineness of the signature." It
is not disputed that- other money was dis
tributed among those who -claimed ' to
have some interest in it. â¢ In other words,
no- kick has yet been made, but the Sey
mour sleuths have not as yet discovered
how it was done. . '

TWO PERSONS VICTIMS
OF CABLE-CAB MISHAPS
Six- Year Old Julia. I*eroy of Berkeley
and Unknown Man Are
Â¦ Injured.
Julia Leroy. a 6-year-old girl from
Berkeley, and an unknown man were the
victims of street car accidents yesterday
afternoon. The injuries sustained in both
cases were not severe and cannot be laid
to any particular negligence on the part
of any one concerned. Â¦ .
The little girl, with her father, Henry
LÂ«eroy, was on a \isit to friends in the
"Ncity. They got off a weft -bound Â¦ Geary
street car at the corner of Mason street,
and the girl left her father and stepped
from behind the car in front of one east
bound. The gripman attempted to stop,
but the little girl was knocked down and
dragged peveral feet on the fender. Her
hip and one limb were badly bruised and
the side of her head was severely scraped.
She was taken to the Ziouse of a friend
and cared for.
The other accident occurred at the cor
ner of eGary and Powell streets. The vic
tim was standing on the car steps as the
car was passing a â¢wagon loaded with
bricks, and the rear end of the load struck
'him. He was knocked down and his face
â¢was severely cut by the stones in the
road. He was treated at a nearby drug
store and recovered sufficiently to go
home without assistance.

SULLIVAN UNBLUSHINGLY ADMITS
CASHING MANY BOGUS WARRANTS
For a member of tho swell Burllnsaxns
Club to take out a hackman's license may
sound out. of place and somewhat ludi
crous, but such a thing has been done.' E.
D. Beylard, Who has borrowed the Bur
llngame Club coach, named it the Pioneer
and takes' Eastern tourists to and from
the Palace Hotel to the park and- C11C
House for two dollars a throw, has Tsesn
called down by the Hackmen's Union.
Day after' day the hackmexx around the
hotel have been agitating the case and
they ; have won a victory. Beylard yester
day applied to the Police Commissioners
for a license."' Before such a document
can be issued the applicant-must prove h'.a
ability to "handle the ribbons," so yester
day after the lunch nour Police Commis
sioner George A. NewhaJl sauntered into
The court -of the Palace and had a heart
to heart talk Â¦ with Beylard, atâ the ..con
clusion of which Beylard climbed on the
box seat of the coach. â¢ With a flourish
and a tootiryr of the horn he drove out
of the court before the admirice gaze of
sixteen Raymond excursionists who were
asking what time the next twenty-five
cent observation car would leave Post and
Montgomery streets.
Newball watched Beylard's driving crit
ically and i=aid that he would certainly
â¢rouch for the competency of the new can
didate to a hackman's license. One of th<Â»
leaders of the four-horse team stumbled
on the way out of the court to the strec
and several hammer- throwers wanted to
tell KÂ«whall that Bevlard could not drive,
but the counterpart of King Edward VIT
stood , by his friend and said that any
horse was liable to stumble.
Mike Coffey. president of the Hackmen's
TJnion, was in-a forgiving: mood yesterday.
He eays that Beylard i& "a good fellow"
and that. "he is not as swelled up as he
was reported to be."
From Coffey's remarks the general^pub-
Ilc may infer that should Bevlard >wact
to join the union his application will fall
Into friendly hands.
When Beylard was asked yesterday if
lie was going to join the union he smiled
Â¦broadly and replied: "Oh, I say, don't
you think you chaps have had enouffh
fun? Now let it go, won't you, and please

; "The assets of the Mutual Life are clean and well invested. The
company refuses, to take risks in countries where climatic condi-
tions are at ali dangerous, and it does not write insurance on sub-
jects who are in any respects below standard. The result of this
careful management is that a policy in The Mutual Life is not
only an absolute protection, but a profitable investment as well.
. The Mutual Life has returned to policy-holders
the enormous sum of $540,479,809,
Its policies are free from technicalities and broadlv liberal.
Every penny of profit belongs to the policy-holders. â¢ -
: Experienced agents can find no better company for which to
work. It has room for workers.
