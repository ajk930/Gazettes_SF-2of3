for I campea some distance irom the tun
nel so as to be near a spring. Then I
groped around further in that narrow
chamber, and found some candles. I re
membered that on the evening previous
I had put tliem in the niche and covered
them u;> for fear of trade rats.
It is nuite impossible for me to accur
ately describe my feelings when I first
knew that I was entombed alive. After
the first awful shock had passed, a dull
despair took i>os.ses?ion of me. I stuck
my candle Into the wall and covered ray,
face with my hands. I groaned aloud.
My voice sounded Hke the wail of a lost
spirit In that living tomb, and I stopped
that. After a while my brain, which had
been whirling, became clearer, and I ba-,
gan to think.
I thought of my wife and two little'
children on Mission street â here in San .
Francisco. I could see her moving about
the little rooms, putting the humble,
household in order, and wondering'
whether I should make a strike and we;
should be reunited. Ah, when? It;
might be weeks before anybody ever (
came into the canyon, and years, perhaps,
before some prospector, in searcl* of.
pocket gold, should- clear away the debris ';
in the tunnel and find my remains.' I j
was nearly overwhelmed as I thought of:
all this, but by a desperate effort con- j
trolled my nerve? and set myself for the j
first time to see what could . be done to
extricate myself from my horrible posi- '
tion.
Almost the first thing that struck me
was that the air remained pretty fresh
in the chamber. I could tell this by the
candle burning with a steady, white light.
Had it become badly vitiated, the candle
would have been a sure indication. . I
knew then that some fresh air must, be
filtering its way through the fallen debris.
I made my way toward the. entrance
and stumbled over a short shovel at the
side of the drift. I picked up the shovel
and resolutely attacked the huge mass of
fallen earth that intervened between Vme
and liberty. I had not worked ten min
utes, however, before the hopefulness of
such an attempt became apparent. It was
evidently a heavy top-slide. As fast as
I removed the earth from t beneath, it was
replaced by fresh talc falling from above.
I was afraid that the talc might pack
so as to utterly exclude all the incom
ing air from the small chamber. In that,
case I should undoubtedly soon be suf
focated.' In the most frightful condition
of mind you can possibly conceive, . I
threw myself upon the ground and re
mained for some time almost insensible â¢
to my â¢ surroundings. The sufferings of a
kfetim.* seemed compressed .into - mo- -
to admit my body and work in â four or
five feet a day. If I could last out for five
or six days I could surely effect my lib
erty. - : " .
Then I remembered I had no tools
nothing but. the shovel. I would have
given worlds for a pick and I looked
everywhere for one, but the search -was
quite/una vailing.
It was at this time, when about to yield
again to despair, that I thought of th.i
candlestick. I took It up and examined
it closely. I had made it myself of the
best Jessop steel. It was all In one piece,
and 1 was very proud of it. It was a very
climbed flown irom rr.y Â«opner note and.
while resting", sharpene-1 it on the shovel.
It was while thus engased that I dis
covered I was threatened by a new dan
ger. Loose dirt occupies about three
times as much space as dirt in place.
Thirteen cubic feet of quartz, for Instance,
will make a ten of ore in place in a. mine.
On the dump it may take thirty. My small
chamber was already a quarter filled with
the fallen talc. Nothing remained to be
done but pack it as closely aa possible. Â«o
I shoveled it up agatnst the intervening
barrier and tramped it as closely as I
could. When I had don* this, beinj?
completely worn out, I took a. small drink
of water and a mouthful of food, lay
down, blew out my candle and sank into
a long, dreamless sleep, the sleep which
generally follows exhaustion.
How many hours went by I do not
know. I had left my watch In tha tent and
had no means of telling day from night.
At last I was, awakened by a trade-rat
running across my face. I lit my candle
and saw it scuttle away through a crev*ce
toward the entrance of the tunnel. Some
how this little visitor from the outer
world greatly cheered me. I ate a llttl.j.
for I was already almost starving, and
drank moderately of the precious water,
which was rapidly diminishing in the can
teen. Then I climbed up into my hole and
resolutely set to work asain.
"When I again ceased my efforts from
sheer weariness, I had made In all eleven
feet from the ceiling of the tunnel. Cal
culating that an upraise of twenty feet
was necessary in order to reach the shaft.
I was a little more than half way. But
by this time, also, my provisions weie
practically exhausted, m*- water nearly v
all gone, and my worklrlg powers greatly
impoverished by the terrific strain I had
been under. Lisht was also absolutelv
necessary to me, and KJt three of my
precious candles remained. I resumed
work, putting out the candle whenever
resting, and relighting it again. For
tunately I had plenty of matches.
Hours of patient digging with tin
candlestick followed, with sleep at in
tervals. I was at this time sixteen feet
from the ceiling of the tunnel. The fallen,
dirt Lad reduced ths heigUt of the cham
ber in which I was confined from six feet
to a narrow coffin-like space in -which X
was barely able to sit upright. I did not
dare to expend much of my strength in
tamping the dirt so as to set more room.
I required It all for work in the uprise. I
was so weak I could hardly climb to tha
top of the hole. My water was entirely
gone. My fineers were worn to the bonÂ®
with the friction of the steel candle
stick.
I felt the time of mv last effort for life
was~fast approaching.
Once more I attacked the too solid ceil
ing of my escape shaft. *
The fear began to grip my heart string*
with deathlike chill that I had missed the
shaft above. True, my gopher hoiÂ© ran up
as straight as a die. but possibly the tun
nel I had run, although at the beginning
it had been started directly under tha
mouth of the old shaftâ possibly the end
where I now was had diverged to the
right or left and I might not be directly
below the ending of the old shaft.
I felt with sinking heart that surely by
this time I must be on a level with the
old shaft. My God! My God! I might
be only two feet to the right or left and
yet as devilishly burled alive as though
I was two thousand feet below ground!
I felt I was going mad.
I began to curse, and in my agony beat
the narrow Walls of this death "hole with
my doubled fists.
, The talc responded with its usual soft,
dead thud. I might be within a foot of
liberty and such stuff as that would give
no indication of a hollow beyond.
â¢ I threw myself against the ceiling and
with both hands jabbed at it with the
blunted candlestick. Crazily I sang as
the sailors do at work. The blood
streamed down my arms.
I ranted, I cursed, I prayed! My arms
seemed like great, helpless, dead weights
as I swung them, from the shoulders
frantically against that hellish piled earth
above.
â¢One last supreme effort! .Unconscious
ness was all but upon me! There was a
crumbling, a crushing, a downpouring or
talc. The shaft! The shaft! Thank God!
Thank God!
.1 thrust my hand upward and found
nothing but space. Madly I tore away the
talc from the edge cf the hole, and climb
ing up lay breathless on the slope of the
shaft. I was saved!
Up the incline I could see the opening
out into God's own green earth beyond.
Painfully I crawled toward the daylight.
Now I felt the revivifying breath of fresh
air. I was or.ee more on the world 'and
one of its people. â¢ â¢.-Â¦Â¦â¢^r
It was high noon. The light dazzled me
âblinded me.
. I closed my eyes and staggered to my
feet. . -Z:- *
' I stretched my arms out and forward to
ward those: glad, warm rays of the sun.
Giddiness seized me and blackness over
whelmed me. With a cry I fell to the
ground and lay still and quiet.
- Finally consciousness . returned to me
sufficiently that I was able to drag my
self to the water hole.
. It was ten days before I could walk the
eighteen miles to Ballarat.

WHEN my claim up in Pleasant
Canyon played out, I and ray
partner, Robert Souies, began
looking about for something
else. We had heard that Shep
herd's Canyon was a good place for pock
et mining. It is about twenty miles south
west of EaKarat. There a <2ark streak
runs thrortgrh the Ii?ht-brown talo.
and when you strike one of those you
can alv.-ays count on finding string go'.l
in more or less quantities. Bob Souies
was a great believer in pocket mines, and
he talked so eloquently about them that
b" the time we made the canyon I was
almost as toil? an enthusiast on the sub
ject as Bob himpelf.
Bob said he bad his eye on a particular
place and when we had got settled in
camp he took me to an old inclined shaft
near the head of the canyon. This shaft
dippod into the h'llside at an angle of
about thirty-five degrees and it is im
portant to remember that, as it has n
peculiar bearing en the moot intqreating
part of my stcry. The shaft had been
punk to a deÂ±>th of about ninety feet. We
explored it. and sure enough, at its face
v.e found a dark streak running throuK 1 .:
the brown talc. 1 wondered why the
parlies working it had abandoned it ani
Dob said they had heard of the Bower's
Hill strike and had gone off after some
thing- better.
Well, we both started in dead game
at first, but after a bit Bob Scu!es' cour
ape gfive out and one day he told me ne
was going to quit. 1 had faith in that
pocket mine, however, and determined t>
stay by it. But when Souies was gone
and 1 was left alone there was one prob
lem to face on which I had not reckoned.
How was I to both fill the bucket and
hoist the dirt from the bottom of that
pinety-foot shaft?
Of course 1 couldn't do it, so I hit on n
plan of running a tunnel lower down th-3
hill just under the shaft. 1 could then
intersect the shaft on a level with its
bottom, wheel my dirt out and sort !t
easily. Struck by the feasibility of this
plan I made myself a rough wheelbarrow
and started in. It was hard, blue dioritt
for the first forty feet. After that i
struck the brown talc and I made near
three feet a day.
I was seventy-six feet in when the ac
cident happened. It was about 9 o'clock
in the morning. I nad driven a hole in
the face, and had loaded it with blacK
powder. Just as 1 was putting in the fuse
there was a roar like thunder, a concus
sion of air that blew out my candle and
nearly carried roe off my feet. Before a
second had passed I realized th.Â»
prodigious disaster that had befallen
me. The roof of the talc tunnel, where it
was weakest, just at its junction with
the diorite, had caved in. What was the
extent of the slide? That was the ques
tion.
1 was very badly frightened, I confess
but for the first few minutes I kept my
nerves pretty welL I relit my candle and
started toward the entrance of the tun
nel. At a distance of less than ten feet
from the face the whole ceiling hal
caved. There was a solid mass of dam;i.
shiny talc, weighing unknown tons, be
tween me and liberty.
The horror of the thing overcame me for
a moment, as the desperate condition in
which I was placed flashed through my
mind. 1 was alone in the canyon. No one
but a solitary prospector on his way to
the upper levels of the Arg-us Range had
visited it In months. I was doomed to the
most horrible of deaths, from which there
was not the slightest hope of rescue. I
was buried alive in a tomb ten feet loner,
four wide and six high. I must remain
there and perish miserably of thirst and
starvation.
It is astonishing how a human being
clings to life. No sooner did this occur
to me than I began to look around to see
what I had in the way of water and pro
visions in the tunnel. I had been twenty
five years in the business and had never
yet neglected to take my canteen under
ground with me. Yes, it was there, in a
little niche. My. lunch was there, too,

Dr. Filippi's book contains no rcpresen-.

that ;the "Silent City" is a. reflection of
Bristol, England: It is believed that it

distance. Â¦ If the Vancouver expedition
brings Back a well-attested picture that
looks like the city of Bristol, one. will be
justified in timing stock in the notion of
identity. But not imt.il then.
Â¦ Practically all the writers on the theory
of the mirage hold that while the images
presented' to the observer's eye may oe
distorted and obscure they have a certain
basis in fact. They are representations
(accurate or inaccurate) of real things.
Napoleon's ariry crossing the sands, of
lower Egypt, saw remote villages, which
were yet below the horizon, lifted into
view.' At sea itisnot uncommon to detect
ships that are yet too far away to be seen
normally. Indeed, there are multiple im
ages, one above the other, and some cf
them upside down perhaps. But in spite
'of their. eccentricities there is a real ship
involved in" the phenomenon.
In some mirages there is great magni
fication of the objects-seen, but only in a
vertical direction. This effect is closely
allied to the apparent lifting of a scene
above its. true position or what sailors call
"looming.". For instance, a mirage once
je-.-t ot three tr!ps made to this locality In
as many years was to secure a photo
graph of the Silent City.' . .
Mr. Bruce further mentions the popular
suspicion that Willoughby's picture is a
"fake" and adds that he himself is under,
such obligations to the prospector that he
could hardly confess the. truth, even if he
had any doubts of his own. - .
Â¦ Whatever doubt may attach to the gen
uineness of the. picture, the rest of '. Wil
loughby's statement may be accepted
without hesitation, because there is plenty
of corroborative evidence. Independent
testimony of yreat value is that- offered
by Dr. Fillppo de Filippl. who .'accom

Mr. Bruce, who has written articles on
Alaska mines, spent six weeks with Wil
loughby in exploring Glacier Bay. One
day they ascended the side of a" mountain
to a level spice affording' a glorious view
of the whole bay. Willoughby led the way
to a pile of rocks, laid carefully one upon
another to a height of about -'.five feet:
Slowly he commenced to throw off rock
after rock until an opening was made in
the center and, inserting his arm, he drew
out what appeared to be a scroll or book
made from several leaves of birch bark.
It was badly, mildewed and upon unrolling
it a-pencil fell to the' ground. The half
dozen pages' looked bright, however, and
contained a record stating that the ob-
nia began to setva down things grew too
humdrum for young Willoughby and he
drifted along the Fraser River, Cariboo
and Cassiar mining camps; then over
the border into Southern Alaska. .
It was in 3887 that Willoughby created a
sensation and gave newspapers a good
story by exhibiting a picture which he
claimed to have taken of a mirage. The
s=tory which Willoughby told in- Juneau
was substantially as follows:
One morning while asleep in his tent a
native called to him excitedly to "get up."
Looking to the north he saw a strange
looking object' hanging over the sides of
the mountain and following the direction
of a stream or glow, of light, which seemed
to radiate from the range sguarely down
upon the glaciers at the head of the bay.
Gradually it became more distinct and
soon assumed the appearance of a city of
immense proportions, stretching out
into the distance until Us farthermost
limits were lost to view.

6earch was fruitlessâ the fugitive 1 lan.l
had again vanished. Like Falcon Island,
it may have been a volcanic upheaval,
a theory supported, perhaps by the ex
treme agitation of the surrounding water.
It is a remarkable coincidence that, since
as early as the ninth century, there is a
circumstantial record of the discovery o*
an island by Irish and Danish fishermen
about the same place, midway between
the coasts of Ireland and Newfoundland.
From that period to the fourteenth cen
tury it was frequently seen by the Eng
lish and French fishermen and mariners,
but It eluded all their attempts to Ian I
on itâ in fact, it was the sea serpent
sensation of those centuries. In Erse- !t
was called Flath Innis. .or the Noble Isl
and; by the Anglo-Saxons, Icockane, or
the country of the waves; and by the
Irish, French and Spanish it was known
as Brasil and Asomanda. or the Island
of Ghosts. But so confident were the
peographers of the sixteenth and seven
teenth centuries of the presence of land
In the particular spot of the Atlantic that
it Is marked on the maps of the period.
It may have been a volcanic part of
the ocean bed. whose active period cov
ered those early centuries till the seven
teenth, when we have the latest circum
stantial record of its aspearance. or It
may have been a Fata Morgana, such as
that described by Commodore Byron in
his voyage round the world, where ha
tells of a phantom island in high Southern
latitude with capes and mountains that
deceived his most experienced mariners.
But to ccme closer to facts, we find that
among the most familiar wonders in phe

that rise to the water surface, or sink to
the bottom by means of some hidden

I I nest June in order lo stuOy the so-
I called "Silent City" mirage. One
of the members cf the expedition,
I. W. Thompson, is now In Snn Francisco,
en route to Vancouver. He has been
studying somo of the famous southern
desert mirages and will shortly publish an
ecccum of his Investigations.
Mr. Thompsrn has mrule a previous trip
to Alaska to gather rr.irageclnta. In fact
he stayed in tho locality of C!aciFr Bay
several v.eeks. hrvinq r o catch a g-ilmp?e
of the "Silent City." but va? not re
warded with a Eight "f the phenomenon.
However, he in no wise questier:? the as
sertions of others who have claimed that
they have seen the "Silent City" mirage.
The consensus of opinion is tr>".t this
mirage, which resembles the city of
Bristol, is only occasionally visible.
"I spoke with C. W. Thornton of Seat
tle about it last year." said Mr. Thomp
son, "and he said 'that the mirage re
quired no effort cf the imagination to
liken it to a city, but was so distinct and
plain that It required faith, instead, to be
lieve that It was not in reality a city.'
Mr. Thornton was one of the members of
the Duke of Abruzzi party, which scaled
Mount St. Elias in ISS7."
The Silent City mirage has been a sub
ject of much discussion during- the last
ten or twelve years. It was first ex
ploited by "Professor" Willoughby. one
of the early California pioneers, who
piloted Professor Muir's vessel to the
Alaska glacier which new bears the lat

made more extensive explorations in
Southern Alaska and to have had more
stirring adventures than any other man
in the frozen fields of the north.

THE PRESENT DAY.

J7 : <t NTOUCHED throughout the Â¦ long
H ; Jj centuries by the Irreverent hand of
\=& modern progress, the East is at last
yielding up its ancient forms and
usages before the march of Western im
provement. Already railroads- and tele
graphs thread the valleys and plains of
Palestine, and modern hotels have sprung
up in some of. the oldest and most ven
erated places mentioned in sacred history.
Across the ancient battlefields, where
once the hosts of IsraeP, with "their
chariots and their horsemen," contended
with their enemies, the iron steed of civili
zation now goes puffing and snorting, with
its car loads of passengers, to the dismay
of those natives who are not yet quite
accustomed to the new order of things.
From Damascus to Jerusalem Is no longer
a tedious caravan journey, for one can go
comfortably by rail- in a few hours. So
rapidly is the network of shining rails
extending, that soon the Holy Land will
be a comparatively simple problem for the
tourist in comparison with the days when
the awkward cam el back was the popular
style of travel.
Even Nazareth, the beautiful little vil
lage In the hill country, "where Jesus was
brought up." has not escaped the modern
invasion. Nazareth has now its telegraph
office, whpre an Armenian operator, in
ordinary European dress, keeps the vil
lage community, in touch with -the great
world. "When the proprietor of the Chris
tian Herald visited Nazareth, during /hjs
tour of the Holy Land, he handed - to. th$
operator the first cable message ever filed
there for transmission Â¦ to the United
States. The operator hesitated, and de
clined to receive it. After telegraphing to
Eeyrout; however, to ascertain the rate,
he sent the message, which speeding from
the little curtained office in Nazareth,
clicked its way to its destlna.tion in Xew
York.
Dr. N. K. Jamel.-a native of Palestine,
now in this country, but who has lately
revisited his own land, has furnished to
the Christian 'Herald this interesting
description of Nazareth as it is to-day:
"As the town is approached from the
south. It presents a very pretty sight, nes
tled along the brow and slope of a hill,
facing directly east, and the spotless white
buildings looking refreshingly picturesque.
The quaint, odd-looking dwellings with
their fiat roofs are here and there Inter
spersed with red-tiled slanting roofed
buildingsâ the tiles fresh from the, .fac
tories of Marseilles, . France. As Oriental
cities go, Nazareth Is remarkably clean Â£
and healthy; in fact all who visit thÂ«j
town are loud In their praises on that'
score.
"During harvest time, between June and
August, the first sight that meets the eyea
of whoever enters the town from the
south Is a great threshing floor. This Is
a perfectly level .twenty-acre , piece ot
ground, where the newly reaped crops. ot
wheat, barley and lentils are gathered In
sheaves and piled in separate heaps, each
being of larger or smaller proportions ac
cording as it represents an Individual
farmer's harvest returns for the season.
As the heaps stand thus, they are ready
for threshing, which process Is performed
by leveling ofT the borders of thÂ© pile tc
a depth of one foot and a width of five to
six feet. Then horses, asses or mules are
driven or ridden, singly or in pairs, round
and round the heap, grinding and tramp
ling underfoot the grain out of. the ears
and the stalks Into chaff until the heap
Is thoroughly threshed. It Is then gath
ered up and removed separately, and.an
other part of the heap is leveled off for
the threshing process. This Is kept up
until all the heap is done, when the new
iy threshed pile.l3 fit for winnowing. This
work is very tedious, aa In fact are all thÂ«
various departments of field labor in Pal
estine, for the farmers are destitute of
every vestige of machinery or labor sav
ing apparatus that are used by more for- V^
tunate peoples. In spring, the threshing
floors afford unsurpassed facilities fo?
camping, on account of their being secure
ly sheltered from all winds by the sur
rounding hills and elevations. Anybody
â¢who has experienced the' hardships of
camp life during- wind and storm wlll : ap
preciate a sheltered spot.
"A very conspicuous building In Naza
reth is the English Orphanage, which was
erected under the auspices of the Female
Educational Society in England in 1S75.
and conducted by that society until 1S09.
Â¦when it was turned over to the manage
ment of the Church Missionary Society.
This school provides for the education of
poor orphan girls from Nazareth and Its
vicinity, and affords a home for them.
These eighty to one hundred girls ara
taught English and Arabic, grammar,
reading: and writing, arithmetic, geogra
phy, history, housekeeping, sewing and
fine needle work. The staff of teachers
Includes five English ladies and six na
tive assistants.
"The common belief, In other lands, Is
that snow never falls in the Holy "Land,
This, however, is not the case. The win
ters are occasionally quite severe in Pal
estine, and heavy snow storms are noth
ing unusual in the elevated parts of thÂ«
country. The brow of the hill on which
stands the Nazareth Orphanage Is nearly
17Q0 feet above sea level."

places the distant ice is so extremely ir

that It resembles a forest of naked trees.

churches, castles and public r Jiflces.
But the Silent City of Alaska, suspend
ed in mid. air. with Its huge buildings of
beautiful and imposing architecture whose
spires and buttresses strongly suggest >ha
cathedrals of the Old "World, is the mirage
of mirages, according- to those who should
know.
This Arctic mystery has lensr been a
subject cf interest for laymen and sci
entists. It is a matter of congratulation
that it is to be thoroughly studied by com
petent students of the mirage. Every pos
sible effort will be made to photograph
the "Silent City" and the. world can credit
any result offered by this expedition.
Mr. Thompson says that there will be
four or five in the party, not counting na
tive guides, and that they will remain at
Glacier Bay until they have completed
a satisfactory investigation of the mir
age. Every modern device of photography
will be carried along to Insure a photo
graph'if it is within the realms of possi
bility. An actual photograph will do more
to establish the Identity of the reflection
than any mere sketch could possiblv af
ford. Yet one of the members of the ex
pedition will be an artist who will en
deavor to make his pencils accomplish
what the camera falls to catch. Should
the "Silent City" appear even for one en
tire afternoon, as it did for the Duke of.
Abruzzi party, the artist ought to have
little difficulty in sketching a counterfeit
presentment of the "Silent City."
There Is every hope that this Vancouver
expedition will bring back valuable data
about the mirage, if not an actual photo

Professor J. D. Everett of Belfast, Ire

the false ideas of nearness and the dis
Â¦tortlon of form that results from looming.
"This vertical mazniflcation is shown in
cliffs and icebergs at sea," said he, "and
produces an effect of pinnacles, spires,
columns and basaltic cliffs. The mag
nificent columns which constitute a part
of the Fata' Morgana (a mirage) in the
â¢Strait of Messina are in like manner to
be attributed to vertical magnification.
An appearance of the same kind, known
as the 'Merry- Dancers,' is often seen by

COVER the bottom of a broad baking
dish an inch deep with mashed po
tatoes, seasoning well with salt,
pepper, and butter. Smooth the top,
then with the back of a spoon make hol
lows all over it. Set in a hot oven for ten
minutes, take out and break -a fresh egg
in each of the hollows. Sprinkle the egg
surfaces lightly with* salt and pepper,
put a^blt of butter on each and return to
the oven. Cook fifteen minutes, longer if
the eggs are wanted hard. Five minutes
cooks the whites and settles the yolk
Serve piping hot. A variant is to mix bits
of cold meats, especially cold boiled ham,
through the potatoes and season the mix
ture with lemon juice or pepper vinegar.
Coldslaw goes well as a relish for this.
MAGIC EGGSâ These make much fun
for a children's party. . Choose a dozen
smooth, sightly potatoes, Jongish and big
ger than the fist. -Wash them well, cut a
hole on Â£he side opposite that which lies
levelest and hollow out inside a space
just big enough to hold an egg. Salt and
pepper the cavities, then break an egg in
each, put on the potato lid, tie it in place
and bake until done. If any egg runs out,
remove it before serving. Pass the pota
toes simply as potatoes â the fun comes in
the little people's amazement Â¦ at finding
Â¦the egg inside. Another way to make
surprise eggs is to break the shells of a
half dozen very carefully, leaving them
together at one edge, and not splintering
them, then to whip three whites as light
as possible, adding a pinch of salt and
a very little powdered sugar, fill the egg
shells, fit them . together, tie them and
bake in a very slow oven. With care they
will look to be entirely whole. The froth
inside is always a source of delicious sur
prise.
EGGS ON TOASTâ Cut the crust from a
stale loaf, slice evenly, toast the slices,
butter them lightly, and arrange on a
baking sheet. Break a fresh egg on each
slice, sprinkle thickly with grated cheese,
add a little salt and red pepper and bake
in a very quick oven to whatever hardness
is preferred. . Make a sauce by frying a
Spanish onion sliced thin in two ounces
of butter, and when tender stirring into
it a pint can of tomatoes. Season to taste
with saltand pepper, and a little sugar,
and just before serving the strained juice
of a lemon.' ''/'".' .
BAKED . EGGS-^Cut the .crust from a
stale loaf and sMce the crumb rather less
than an inch thick. Butter the slices well
on both sides and line the bottom of a
baking dish with them. Break three fresh
eggs over them, sprinkle in salt and pep-*
per, put in another layer of buttered
bread, break more eggs and finish with
bread over the top. Take care not to
break the egg yolks, and to lay the upper
slices so lightly as not to mash them.. The
bread ought to bean Inch below the dish
rim. . Now pour over the bread a can of
tomatoes that have been mashed through
a sieve and seasoned Â¦ with salt, pepper, a.
little sugar, and :a suspicion of onion
juice. Â¦Cook for-half an hour. in a hot
oven. Serve wJth cress arid cut lemon.
HERE ARE NINE AND ORIGINAL WAYS TO COOK EGGS.
' AN; EGG BORDERâBoil half a dozen
eggs twenty minutes, drop in cold water,
peel, and keep warm. Make a thick bor-
der of good, well-seasoned mashed pota-
toes around the edge of a platter, press
the eggs Into the border, points up, and
set In a hot .'oven for three minutes.- Fill
the center with, string beans boiled and
buttered, or. young carrots stewed in mut-
ton brothi or Brussels sprouts, boiled very :
tender. Or the rilling may be of cold
meat, cut in dice and heated with a can of

button mushrooms. Whatever it is, add
it Quickly, garnish the border outside with
sprigs of cress, and serve very. hot. .This
is a handsome, as well as substantial dish
for luncheon or supper, and not unworthy
consideration for a Sunday tea. '
EGGS WITH' OLIVES^-Boil the eggs
hard, peel them,'flatten the big end so
they will stand, and in the small one cut a
deep narrow, hole just big enough to hold
a baby olive. Put in the olives, stand the
eggs'in'a bed'of crisp, lettuce leaves, and
pour over them a French'dressing mada
with three tablespoonfuls of oil -to one of
vinegar or lemon juice, a little dry mus
Â»tard, sugar, salt and white pepper,

CURIOUS FACTS ABOUT BIRDS.
The curlews are dainty and charming
birds to see. some pink, some white.
Birds In flight often lose their bearing?,
being blown aside from their course by
the wind. In this case they are as badly
off as a mariner without a compass in ;Â¦
strange sea on a starless night.
All very young birds, by a wise provi
sion of nature, are entirely without fear,
until they are able to fly. The reason of
the delayed development of fear is that
being unable to fly, the birds would strug
gle and fall from their nests at every
noise and be killed. Suddenly, almost In
a day, the birds develop the sense of fear
when their feathers are enough grown so
that they can fly.

Arctic explorers 'to find such quantities
of singing birds within the Arctic circle
They are abundant beyond belief. But thd
Immense crop of cranberries, crowberr' â¢Â£

the birds.
A stick of wood seven Inches long an \
a quarter of an inch In diameter was once
taken from a wren's nest. It is very sin
gular that so small and delicate a bird
should use such rough material with
which to construct its nest. If an eagie
should use material proportioned to 1-s
size Its nest would be made up of fence
rails and small saw logs.
The extraordinary situations In which
nests are found occasionally almost give
one the Impression that birds must be
endowed with a sense of humor. For in

Instructor, believes that there is no end

In our midst, and it v.H! 'oe a feather In

Dr. Wood. Stanford's physical tiirectoi
worked out some of the exercises and
Miss March continued to invent along his
lines.
"The work is largely experimental as
yet," she says. "We are making new
exercises all the time and improving upon
old ones. Until we get them in perfect
order and are able to give satisfactory di
rections for all the exercises we don't
vrant to publish instructions in them."
So not until Dr. Wood's return will any
manual of them be issued. In the mean
time you can get some idea of v/hat the
Â¦work means by visiting "Itoble Gym," as
Btanfordites name it, and watching the
sections at work on the big. hard gymna
sium mattresses that don't soften the floor
to any marked degree.
"The mats ought to be hard," the In
structor says. "Never take the exer
cises on a springy couch or bed. It gives
to your every motion and small benefit is
derived."
A dozen girls were at It yesterday.
Miss March led them upstairs to the gal
lery and gave them orders to spread them
selves out. They lay side by side In a
panting row, for they had come from hard
tugging at the pulley weights, and the
mat wcrk was ordered to "rest them."
"It may sound queer to call it rest, but
you try it yourself and see," Miss March
trays "It gets the girls off their feet
and' that Is 'one of its great advantages."
"Ready!" she cried, and the girls took
position in an even row. straight out and
liiit i.n their backs, with arms down at the
sides. It was easy to see at a glance that
they had been taught to relax. The mat
Lore tlieir entire vreight and there was not
a tcr : e muscle to be seen.
Breathing came first. Splendid, long
breaths they took, that you could see
heav:i:g them up and down like waves on
a sea. With hands resting lightly on the
chest they breathed only chest-deep.
tritti hands at the waist they breathed all
the way down to the abdomen, as an ani
mal does.
"Alv.ays be sure to start off with plenty
of breathing," they were told. "It puts
you in good form for the other exercises."
Then came the greatest exhibition of
kicking ever Been outside a baby show.
There lay the girls in all sorts and condi
tions of costumes, for the only require
ment In regard to gym suits is that they
be sklrtless an-1 corsetless. The girls have
on the neck. Even with tills warning,
the little red-stockinged one, who always
seemed to be in trouble, gave a SQtieal
and rolled over sideways, complaining
that her neck was broken: The rest ac
complished the trick, and there they lay,
a row of young ladies presenting a. most
unique appearance with their legs thrown
up over their heads and their toe3 touch
ing the floor beyond their heads. They
lay there until they were out of breath
with giggling at each other.
There are plenty of exercises given on
the side and front as well as on the back.
A slmDle one- given on the fide was with
legs extended, raising and lowering the
upper one. In another thÂ© knees were
drawn up as far as the chest by dragging
them along the noor.
"When the class was lying face down
there were more neck exercises, raising
and lowering the head. Next came kick-

upward to a quick count. The lesson
wound up with a scrambling exercise, In
which the girls raised themselves to a
knee-and-elbows position . in a count of
four, one count for each limb, then ex
tended again In. the same count. They
looked a good deal like a. herd of four
legged creatures getting partly up and
lying down again.
After the class was dismissed Miss
March led the way Into her cozy little
office downstairs, and there she talked
over the general benefit of the system.
Â¦ "It misses hardly any part of .the body,**
she said. "The neck profits."
From the way her own well poised head
sits upon her well poised body It looks as
if the neck surely did profit.
"The lung development Is increased,"
she went on.
Her lungs have a splendid inflation.
"But the great benefit Is noticed In tha
muscles of the lower back, the abdomen,

digestive organs by giving mechanical
pressure over the abdomen. Functional
activity is stimulated. Now an exercise

THE SUNDAY CALL.
'
THE
LATEST
FAD IN
PHISICAL
CULTURE
3THE year 1900 maintained the reputa
tion of the century whose tale of
years Is completed, by producing
the largest crop of books recorded In
America. Besides its size, the crop aver
aged high from a literary point of view,
and the publishers' year was successful
as a whole.
In the United States 6356 books were
published as against 5321 put out in 1S99.
This was the highest number reached In
the history of American publishing. The
next greatest number of books was turned
out in 1S9S. when the total was E703, a
number â¬53 below that of the last vear.
The Publishers* Weekly, the "trade pa
per" of the publishers, In speaking of the
books of the year, remarks:
The Quality of the books published was
ClstlncUy better than it had been for
three years past, notably in the depart
ments of fiction, biography, fine arts and
history. A special feature of the year
was the reissue of celebrated books In
fine and carefully edited editions. Almost
every author whose name ' has outlived
the copyright restrictions has been put
Into attractive permanent form, and many
American authors have edited their works
for their publishers.
The wars that marked the closing cen
tury brought forth a long list of books on
South Africa, China, the Philippines and
the West Indies, and there was a vast
number of books \ of which the keynote
was social problems, the wonderful inven
tions, and the great spread of educational
privileges which have marked the cen
tury.
Of more than SOQO volumes published In
1900, 4490 were new works, and 186S new
editions. InU900 the figures had been 1749
and 572 respectively, showing a slight de
crease in the production of new books,
and a very large/increase in the reissue
of old works. In fiction, there were 616
new books and 662. new. editions:, in 1S99
the figures were 749 and 183 respectively.
Of educational books. 431 new volumes
were issued and 210 old ones reissued, a
remarkable change from the 387 and 32 In
the corresponding classes In 1899. Almost
every department shows a similar change,
those departments which do not show as
decided a change ' in ' another direction.
For instance, in' 1889 there were 288 new
and 22 reissues of books classed as bi
ography and correspondence: in 1900 the
numbers were 225 and 49,'Even more strik
ing are the' figures regarding "poetry and
dramas"; in 1S99 there were 302 new books
and 31 reissues: in 1900 there were only
192 new books but 20S reissues. So It was
with books classed as "literature and col
lected works": 1S09 had seen 304 new vol
umes, and 42 new editions, while the last
year witnessed the production of 187 and
356 respectively. . , , V'w
Of the 625S books issued, 3878 were the
new.'or old work of American authors; 1383
were those of foreign, mostly English au
thors manufactured here, and .1090 were
English books imported complete, not
printed here. In 1899 there were 1124 En
glish books imported for publication here.
Fewer books, by 418,- were published In
England during 1900, than during the pre
ceding year; the figures were 7149 for 1900,
and 7567 for 1S99. The war is credited with
injurine the publishing business In Ene-
land. It is. to be noted, however, that 197
books on the Boer war appeared during
the year, .of which 102 were published be
tween July and January. The chief.de
crease in output was in the fiction class,
where the figures for 1900 were 1563 new
books and 546 xelssues, as compared with
1S25 and 736 published ln:1899.
. In France 13,362 ' books were published,
an increase of S77 books over the number
Issued In 1S99; 5910 "musical compositions
were printed. 149 more- than In the previ
ous year, and 3>2 photographs, engravings
and lithographs, as against 7S1 put forth
j in 1899. Despite all drawbacks, therefore,
.the last year of; the nineteenth, century
' was successful In the publishing business
of three of the four bookish peoples of the
world. There would seem to be no reason
why Germany's publishers should not
likewise have enjoyed a prosperous end

James Harrison "Wilson's book
.â¢*Â» "China: Travels and Investiga
tions in ths . Middle Kingdom â A
Study of Its Civilization and Possi
bilities," made its appearance- in
1887. This work now appears in a
third edition. It has been much en
larged and brought up to date in re
gard to the recent troubles with the
Boxers and the relief of the legations.
It -will rank with the best books on
the subject which have been pressht
ed to the public.
General Wilson's first idea in.
bringing out this book was to show
the Chinaman as he was before for
eign invasion and with that idea in
view the general spsnt a year in
thoroughly investigating Northern,
Central and Southern China.
The main idaa of the book is to
show the progress made in China dur- ,
ing recent years and also the possi
bilities of future development both
from internal efforts and the co-ope
ration of foreign business men.
â¢ The second edition of the work was
published in 1894, when the Chinese-
Japanese war changed existing con
ditions sufficiently to -warrant further
investigations. At the time of the
breaking out of the Boxsrs General
Wilson was in Cuba commanding the
departments of Matanzas 'and Santa
Clara. A man so familiar with Chin
ese affairs could naturally have his
services put to much better uss in
China than in Cuba, so at his own
request the general was transferred.
He- went; as sreond in command to
G'SneralCIiaiiseaiU)yirrived. in Peking
soon after ths relief of the legations.
He took part in all the proceedings
of any importance and remained until
the forces were ordered back to the
Philippines. Then he returned to San
. Francisco, sometime last December.
Having been in such closs touch
Â¦with army atcairs in China, his ac
count of all th'sse rscent troubles can
not fail to bs considered as authorita
tive.
General "Wilson holds Field Mar
shal Count von "Waldersee very ; high
ir his esteem. He says the Count is
"a wise nnd, masterful man, whose
high sense of justice and propriety
cannot, v/hils reflecting credit upon
his own country, fail to be of graat
benefit to the other powers.".
, The author has much to say of in
terest concerning Li Hung Chang,
with whom he renewed acquaintance
â¢when the great Chinese statesman ar
rived to treat for peace.
"In the present edition there are
two excellent maps^-one showing the
city of Peking and the other Chin.-)
as a-whole.
.It is evident that General Wilson's
work is highly regarded, for the first
edition was translated into Japanese,
and it is said that it was the first
means of calling Japan's attention to
the lack of preparation in China for
war. (Published by D. Appleton &
Co., New York. Price $1.50.) ,.

The girl's husband finally dies and the
property Is left to her for life. Henry
knows that she still loves Kipper and can
not see why she does not send for him
or eo to Africa.
The interest of the story centers in a
double sacrifice. Kipper gives up his old
chum and sweetheart and goes to Africa
in order that he shall not interfere with
her chances of marrying and becoming the
Marchioness of Appleford.

much as turning- a hair. 'I'm afraid you're

"She was a pretty little thing, even
then, in spite of the dirt, with those eyes
like saucers and red hair. It used to be

they can get to itâ and it's auburn.
" 'The menoo to-day.* I says, 'Is that
you pet outside 'fore I clip you over the
ear. and that you take that back and put
it where you found it,' meaning, o' course,

"Young Kipper" is the hero of his first
tale. One fine day Kipper walks Into
the "coffee-shop," with a "young imp of
a girl on his arm." That was in the days
when Kipper was a newsboy.
** 'Garsong,' he calls out, 'what's the
menoo to-day?'
His first story is concerned with that
period of his life spent in the "coffee
phop in the Mile End rpad." That was
before Henry changed his name to
"Henri" â a title which he earned through
his wife's and his own efforts, which fin
ally placed him as garcon in a leading
French restaurant. A recital of Henry's
life is not the purpose of the book, but it
comes out through the lines as he tells
the stories of other persons' doings.
Henry has five good stories to tell and
all of them together will only take an
hour to read. Under the simple guise of
waiter there Is in Henry's make-up the
deeper vein of observer and philosopher of
the world. .
In lntroilrcingr him Mr. Jerome says:
"This is the s=tory. among others, of
Henry the waiterâ or, as he now prefers
to call himself, Henriâ told to me in the
long dinins-room of the Riffel Alp Hotel,
where I once stayed for a melancholy
week 'between seasons,' sharing the echo
ing emptiness of the place with two
maiden ladies, who talked all day to one
another in frightened whispers. Henry's
construction I have discarded for Its
amateurishness; his method being gener
ally to commence a story at the end, and
then, working backward to the beginning,
wind up with the middle."
JEROME K. JEROME has a certain
droll and peculiar humcr all his
own, but it is not so much in evi
dence in his latest productionâ "The
Observations of Henry." "Three Men in
a Boat" will always stand for Jerome
with the i>ublic at large, and also his
play-writing is recognized, but "The Ob
servations of Henry" is not so peculiarly
Jeromls=h In flavor as we all could wish.
It may be that we expect too much from
this humorist on the merits of past work,
for this last book of his under the signa
ture of some unknown author could just
ly be considered a work of merit. The
drawback that strikes the reader Is that
it does not ring true of what we have been
led to expect from Jerome.
Henry is a waiter, an English waiterâ
a cockney.

"Now, If the dictionary way of using

that coffee is capable of being ground,
that sugar Is capable of being dissolved,
that lead Is capable of being melted and
that iron is capable of. being welded. If
It be proper to use capable in a passive
sense, what use have we for susceptible?"

the Standard. Worcester and Webst*" use
capable in the passive tense, but the word

Whether It is right or wrong for a man
to smoke a pipe in the street is not the
question/and for the sake of avoiding ar
gument with Mr. Ayres on that point let
it be said that a man who smokes a pipe
in % street Is a very vulgar fellow indeed,
"and should be sent home forthwith, put
in a dark closet for a day and not allowed
any jam on his bread for a week; but why
in the world should Mr. Ayres depart so
abruptly from his subject and make an
undignified attack upon a point that de
serves discussion only In a book of cheap
etiquette? His readers are apt to as
sume, after this tirade, that he is a man
of narrow-gaugs mind. They may possi
bly think that, after all, Mr. Ayres is
raising a tempest In a teapot in some of
his discussions on ill-used words. Here
Is an example, for instance, where It
seems to be a question of Mr. Ayres
against all authorities:
. "We live in a street, meet people In a
street and do things In a street, and not
on or upon a street. The man, however,
that smokes in the street would be likely
to insist that on the street Is good
enough English for him. This is doubly
true of the man that smokes a pipe in
the street. 'No man can smoke a pipe in
the street and have the appearance . of
being other than a vulgar fellow. He that
does it descendsâ In his mannersâ to the
level of the groom and the hackraan."
Mr. Alfred Ayres has written a valuable
and useful work for the use of those
who wish to speak and write correctly.
It is called "Some Ill-used Words." The
title is self-explanatory. There Is one
thing to be regretted In thi3 book, and
that is that a man of Mr. Ayres' evident
learning in matters of correct English
should make the mistake of inserting the
following:
Some Ill-TJsed Words.

"Monsieur Beaucalre" Is now being
translated Into the French and the story
will appear In book form in France dur
ing the coming season. The story of tha
French hero, with hi3 many adventures
and his love affairs, ought to prove Inter

"Beaucaire" was a cousin of one of tha
French kings will surely add to the at
tractiveness of the tale for French read
ers. McClure, Phillips & Co.. the Ameri

cation for a German translation.
Charles Major, the author of "When
Knighthood Was In Flower." will call his
second book, "The Bears of Bine River.
In this, the popular author has taken his
vivid pictures of historical adventura
right into his own State, though, as ha
says, it is "away back In the twenties,
when Indiana was a baby State." Tha
stories, which form a continuous narra
tive, are of the real bears and of the sort
that will make this book enormously pop
ular. Doubleday, Page & Co. are the pub
lishers, and it Is to appear early in tha
autumn.
"The Heritage of Unrest" Is In Its third
edition. Few recent novels have been bet
ter described by their titles than this. It
illustrates Miss Gwendolen Overton's style
of the apt phrase that she has put the
spirit of her book, in four words. Tha
breaking down of the floodgates In tha
social barriers to marriage with Inferior
races is the motive of this story, which
is peculiarly American In its social out
look and Its plot.

5THE MAN THAT HELPED JERRY McGOVERN. "THE TERRIBLE" TO MAKE HIS FORTUNE
TWO years ago James J. Corbett,
accompanied, by a California friend,
walked into "the Broadway Athletic
Club. New York, amid the cheers of
nght-thlrsty spectators, who had
come together for the purpose of seeing
Terry McGovern make one of his whirl
wind finishes.
Corbett bowed acknowledgments to the
ovation and said to his guest of the even-
Ing: "I may get a hand or two from the
crowd, but you will see to-night a boy
who Is the greatest fighter that has ever
lived. He's a human fighting machine.
All that is necessary is for somebody, to
look out for him before the fight, see that
he is In good shape and place him in the
ring. The boy will do the rest."
And Corbett's words fit the facts ex
actly. There Is a man behind Terry Mc-
Govern who looks out for every little de
tail of his life.
That man is Sam Harris. Without him
McGovern would be lost He has depend
ed upon this man for four years and in all
that time Terry has not proved In any
manner or means recalcitrant to Harris'
suggestions. The manager wields an ab
solute power over the fighter, yet at no
time Is it displayed In any way but a mild
suggestion.
McGovern in the ring forgets everything
else but his pugilistic business. He steps
inside the ropes for one set purpose, to
lay low his antagonist with the' utmost
dispatch. If the measure of success hangs
upon accomplishment of purpose, no one
in this world has been more successful
than this same little terror in gloves.
That Is but one form of his success. No
man fights professionally for the pure love
cf fighting. The desideratum Is always
money and the more money a prizefighter
can earn, just so much more is he suc
cessful.
McGovern Is the fighter, Harris Is the
money earner, and between the two they
have builded a bank roll that would
satisfy many men the rest of a long
natural life.
McGovern is by no means a boy under
the domination or mastery of another
mind. He has picked out a -manager and
he allows the manager to manage.
Terry win talk to you on divers sub
jects, but the moment you stray into the
forbidden realm he is at you with his pe
culiar, frank and pleasant smile: and
â¢'You'd better see Harris about that."
This is strange in the pugilistic camp.
Theatrical stars have their managers, but
Â¦with the majority of pugilists there is
such a strong love of lingual exercise in
their make-up that they nullify every ef
fort made in their behalf by the so-called
managers.
Harris is more to McGovern than a
manager of his business affairs. He looks
out for the big little fellow's private mat
ters and invests the money that the fight
ing brings into the exchequer. He has
made some lucky speculations for McGov
ern. The two are practically partners in
many business ventures, which in the ag
gregate represent considerably more than
1100,000, all of which owes its basic
strength to the use of a wonderfully clev
er pair of fists and the bright, shrewd
brain of a skillful entrepreneur.
McGovern and Harris have plunged into
the theatrical business, and they run
stables and they give fights, all of which
have proved to be remunerative.
Prizefight promoters, north, east,
south and west, have tried to break
through the Harris crust which shells
McGovern in completely. They have ex
erted every effort to deal with the feath
erweight himself; they have gone so far
as to promise untold benefits if the Ter
rible Teddy would only do this and that
end agree to fight without dragging his
manager into the negotiations. They
might as well try the repression of the
tide. Harris Is McGovern when it comes
to business, a fact that more men than
one have discovered in their match-mak
ing endeavors.
The following incident will show how
implicitly McGovern relies upon Sam Har
ris: Frank Erne, the lightweight cham
pion, is bristling in his desire to get a re
turn match with the champion feather
weight. On Sunday last he drove out to
the Casino, the then training quarters of
the latter, to beard the lion in his den.
After salutations and hand-shaking Mc-
Govern and Erne sifted out of the crowd
of idlers and the curious and had a quiet
heart to heart talk. Erne, who is his own
manager, steered the conversation to a
match between the two. McGovern felt
â¢what was coming and before Erne had
a chance to reach the vital question Mc-
Govern was there with his Harris answer,
the shibboleth of the McGovern-Harris
forces.
"Don't count me in the game at all."
says Terry. "Why. I will fight anybody
under the sun. Sharkey or Jeffries if need
be, if Harris tells me to." But there is
no need of Terry McGovern fearing that
he will be matched with Sharkey, Cor
l-ott. McCoy. Jeffries, Ruhlin or even the
pugilistic shades and departed spirits
of the bodies of some of those fistic
gladiators who have outlived their pecu
liar kind of usefulness. Harris knows
whom to match and whom not to
match with his world-beater. The
story of McGovern's ring career has
the strains of Harris running through it
from beginning to end. Now that- the
fighter has won everything he puts his
lists to, Harris can dictate terms and con
ditions, and if any outsider imagines' for
a moment that the manager neglects a
chance to squeeze the best of the bargain
let him read the signed articles when a
match is being made.
McGovern is still the McGovern. as far
as fighting ability goes, and the manager
puts a high valuation on his principal's
capacity for money-making.
It was four, years ago when Sam Har
ris first took hold of the "Fighting Ma
chine." the name that Jim Corbett first
bestowed upon the Terrible Terry. Har
ris saw McGovern's capability as a fight
er. He was a raw lad of fine physique,
without much talent as a boxer, but with
a spirit for administering punishment that
few of the heavy-weights ever displayed.
He was then as he is nowâ a natural
lighter. Harris* keen eye saw that this
boy would develop. His physique was ui>-
like that of any other feather-weight. Mc-
Govern's sturdy frame, his big muscles
and his remarkable strength, combined
with a readiness to give and to take all
a fight' ever offered, meant much to Har
ris as he saw the then unknown young
ster end the fistic career of a man better
acquainted with the ways of the ring.
From that time . on McGovern placed
.himself entirely in the hands of Harris.
He himself realizes that the manager's
shrewdness has done more for him than
he could hope to secure by representing
himself. At first It was difficult to find
fights for Terry, but after . a -while,
through the persistence of the manager
good fighters gave him a chance. They
all fell- before this fist churner. In the
beginning the fighting World looked upon
this new comer as something not quite
explicable, and laughed at Harris when'
he asked for matches with the best feath
er-weights of the day. Harris, in turn
laughed in his quiet way as one after an
other they were all toppled over by Mc-
Govern, until to-day there is no one in his
class left to meet him. Â¦
It was Harris' shrewdness that won
the match for McGovern when Frank
Erne was knocked out. Erne agreed to
fight at 128 pounds and to put out Mc-
Govern in ten rounds: Erne at 128 pounds
was a weakened man, incapable of doing
himself justice. In his anxiety to reach
the weight limit he went one and a half
pounds under it. Harris said before -the
tight. "Erne can't fight his best at that
weight." Terry thinks about these things
and tha.t Is why, to him, the manager's
word Is a' law of its own.
This country has seen some prizefight
managers, Tom O'Rourke and Billy Brady
and Parson Davies being the most promi
nent. Harris' name -will be added- to the
list of the big successful ones, although he
has had but one big manâ and he happens
to be a small oneâ under his hands. Har
ris is not like O'Rourke. The oily smooth
ness, the suave, patting manner that fair
ly stuck out on O'Rourke are not com
penents of Harris* personality. - He is a
quiet, businesslike majt, agreeable of man
ner and has many friends. His strongest
quality is tact. He goes about the coun
try making friends and is well liked out
side of the class of fight promoters who
fail to land Terry for . their, clubs. .
This manager has many irons In the
fire and the handles of most of them are
Terry McGovern. The theatrical venture,
the stable of race horses and the primal
business of the principal, fighting, have
made the firm of ' McGovern & Harris
very opulent. The firm has a senior part
ner who dominates all, other members,
but rules in such a way as never to pro
voke a ruffle on the equanimity of the
subject. -
The day that the party arrived from
the East McGovern thought he would go
to the race track. In fact, he said he
wanted to go very much, Â» The crowd was
gathered around him in the Palace court
and an idea suddenly struck Terry that
he should see Harris first before deciding
upon his individual movements. Harris
said: "No: we'll go to the training quar
ters." Terry simply said, "All right." And
they went where Harris pointed the finger.
While making the general statement
v_ at a , woman's testimony is . as trust
worthy as a man's and perhaps more so,
there is % case, however, where the
rule will' hot applyTand that is when a
mother is testifying In behalf of a child
accused of an offense. In such instances
the mother will almost invariably stretch
a point or two in order to save her child,
but perhaps this is more than pardonable.
Judging from the verdicts of juries in
case3 that have been tried before me
where the evidence of a woman was ar
rayed against the evidence of a man,
I. would say that people generally place
more confidence in\t.he testimony of a
woman than of a man,' because in every
Instance the jury has returned a verdict
Jn accordance with the evidence given by
the woman. I recall one case in particu
lar, tried recently before a jury where
the evidence of one. woman prevailed
as against the direct contradiction of
three ir.ale witnesses.
ALFRED J. FRITZ.
SEEM TO HAVE v BUT ONE
' FAULT. \ '
Â«*V*/ VERY difficult question to answer
[ I in a few words, "Is a woman's tts-
I j timony as trustworthy as a
V. I man's?"
JL I say as a general proposition the
testimony of a woman on the witness
TO the question, "Is a woman's tes
timony as trustworthy as a
man's?", I would make answer in
the affirmative.
'I believe that as a general rule
a woman has more regard for the
solemnity of an cath than a man. At
least they have so impressed me while
taking the oath and giving their evidence.
I have also noticed that a woman will
give more attention to details than a man
and observe many small things that
would escape the average male witness.
HAVE MORE REGARD FOR AN
OATH.
In answering the question propounded it
must be remembered that many among
the women who appear in courts do. not
represent the average woman.
By reason of her intultiveness woman is,
perhaps, more desirous to have her opin
ions received as testimony than is man,
but when the rules of evidence prohibit
ing the statement of conclusions are ap
plied no reason will appear why her testi
mony should be deemed less trustworthy
than the testimony of a man.
FRANK J. MURXSKY.
Courts receive with caution the evidence
of the swift witness, the hostile witness,
the abnormally litigious person, the per
son of weak memory, the -witness with the
photographic memory who pretends to re
collect, accurately the most minute de
tails of immaterial. matters, the witness
who cannot be mistaken, the over- voluble
witness and the witness who seeks to im
pose his conclusions upon the court in
stead of the facts about which he is being
interrogated; hut these types are not con
fined to either sex.
Considering the many and varied Influ
ences of environment which surround the
Individual in our day tending to affect his
point of view. It would sometimes seem
that the narrat'on of a plain statement of
facts has become a fine art. Where self
interest, the desire to win, the prejudices
of education, commercial and social stand
ing, pride of wealth, or despair of poverty
are involved. It is difficult to separate
facts from conclusions; or to make unem
"bellished and accurate statements.
Lapses from the' truth, the coloring of
facts and the suppression of testimony,
however, are not more noticeable among
women than among men witnesses; as
many among the stronger sex as among
the weaker are prone to disregard the ob
ligation to tell the whole truth, and to for
get that to tell less than the whole truth
is to deceive.
Is the confidence which the law ex
presses In the woman's testimony justi
fied?
What position would a woman 'occupy in
the forum where her rights are being de
termined if, in addition to the rules
which apply when judging the credibility
of all -witnesses, there should be applied
to her the faintest assumption that be
cause she is a woman her statements are
worthy of less trust than those of her
male opponent? *
IT may be said, by way bf preface, that
there are certain virtues practically
monopolized by women, and others
(though very few, it must be frankly
acknowledged) that are oftener found
in men than In women. But neither the
truth-telling virtue nor its antithetic vice.
lying, can be credited to, or charged
against the one eex more than the other.
I do not ignore the obvious fact that the
various virtues which go to make up -what
we commonly call "good character" are
attributable in part to heredity and in a
degree to moral training. So true is this
that generally speaking if we but know a
man's pedigree to be good â good not in the
sense In which â¢ self-nominated "blue
bloods" boast of high descent, but good
in that it bespeaks a virtue-lovine an
cestry, whether of high or low degree so
cially and further know his moral train
ing- to have been good, we assume that
heredity and moral education dovetailing
in that man's conscience make him im
mune against many vices and Crimea.
The fact that occasionally a man thus
doubly fortified against temptation be
comes a flagrant -wrongdoer, merely Il
lustrates the exception to the general
rule.
But. in dealing with the vice of lying,
all the tests by which we determine char
acter generally fall us to some extent,
just as, according to the sage dictum of
the village weather prophet, all signs fail
in sunny weather. The only inference I
draw from this fact is that lying mav be
differentiated from the other vices in
this. The tendency or proneness to vice
in general is the result (as above inti
mated of a natural tendency in that di
rection, due to heredity training or to
the t-* - o factors working In combination,
while upon the other hand the specific
vice, lying, is largely a matter of consti
tutional propensity which, though modi
fied, can never be altogether controlled
by artificial correctives. Or, in other
words, a person having this Inborn lying
tendency will ever remain a liar, despite
all that may be done to eradicate it in the
way of even the best moral training.
Just as on the other hand a
person otherwise weak and prone to vice
will be truthful even if this, like that

That question is being discussed all
over the United States and has
awakened so much interest tlial The
Sunday Call has asked some of
San Francisco's prominent Judges
for an expression of their opinion,
founded on their own experience
with witnesses.
SEX REALLY MAKES NO DIF
FERENCE
tlxe question, "Is a woman's tcsti-
/N an unfortunate and unguard
ed moment, at least from the
viewpoint of the fair sex, a
Chicago Judge made remarks that
led his listeners to understand that
he was not partial to women as
truthful witnesses. In fact he said
tluxt a woman's testimony was by
no means as reliable as that of a
man. Then immediately sprang up
tue, be linked with a thousand crimes.
Tne best evidence, to my mind, that i
am not wrong in this view is that the ex
pression "he is a constitutional liar" Is a
hackneyed phrase often used in speaking
of men known, as a tactful Japanese eu
phoniously expressed it, to habitually
"say the thing that is not."
All that I have thus far said mav seem
not to bear upon the question you ask.
and yet it is relevant as explanatory of
answer I ain about to make thereto.
Witnesses, with reference to their credi
bility, may be divided into three general
classes â the witness who. In the language
of the witness' oath, tells "the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth";
the witness who tells a He, a whole lie
and nothing but a lie, and the witness
who aims to tell the truth, but unwitting
ly, by reason of an excitable imagination,
inflamed by bias of one sort or another,
deviates widely therefrom. This third
division admits of several subdivisions,
but the above general classification must
serve our present purpose.
I must say that I cannot recall any
woman, testifying before me, whom I could
justly assign to the second classâ that
of the deliberate, perjured liars; but more
than* one man -whose testimony I have
heard I unhesitatingly place there.
Within the first classâ those who tell
the strict truth irrespective of the re
sultâI place a number of witnesses, about
caually divided as to sex.
Up to this point honors are largely with
the women. It is when I come to deal
with the third class above mentioned that
woman comes to grief.
The average witness, even more than
he or she realizes, is a partisan; and be
ing a partisan. Is often" unconsciously and
therefore Innocently influenced by strong
partisan feeling to believe that to be true
which best serves the interest of the par
ty in whose behalf the witness testifies.
women are more susceptible than men,
I think, to this weakness, though it is a
defect it must be confessed that oft
leans to virtue's side. For its mainspring,
in n-.cst instances, is sympathy or love.
Yet it Is a fact that must be reckoned
with by lawyers and Judges, and tends
frequently to detract from the credibility
or trustworthiness of a woman's sworn
statement. For the ultimate fact to be
re-eclved from a witness' testimony is the
truth or falsity of his statement, rather
than a sentimental and metaphysical in
quiry as to why his testimony, if false,
is so.
Everything considered, I do not feel

VERY TRUSTWORTHY ARE
WOMEN.
IS a woman's testimony as trust
worthy as a man's?
Yes.
Responding to the Influence of mod
ern belief the law has granted
woman the right to acquire and convey
property, to engage in business, to parti
cipate in the management of corpora
tions, and to administer the estates of de
ceased persons. The exercise of these
rights frequently causes litigation and
necessitates the taking of woman's testi
mony. Were there the slightest presump
tion of the possibility of a difference be
tween the worth of a woman's word
and the word of a man the granting of
these powers would be a mockery, for one
of the fundamentals of litigation is that
every -witness is presumed to speak the
truth. Such presumption may be over
come in many ways, but to Impair it by
any supposition that the credibility or
trustworthiness of a witness may be af
fected by any consideration of sex would
destroy the value of judicial inquiries.

E. P. MOGAN,
KEEN PERCEPTION OF
EVENTS.
The only fault I have observed in wo
men testifying is a desire at times to
dwell upon unimportant details and a few
instances where they favored the admis
sion cf hearsay testimony. Men have been
equally guilty In- this respect, however.
When there Is something at stake and by
stretching the testimony the object may
be attained, I have never been able to ob
serve any circumstance that convinced me
that a woman's testimony is less trust
worthy than a man's.
stand is equally as reliable as the testi
mony of trie man, but there may be excep
tions and in that case one must be ac
quainted with the specific circumstances
in order to j frame an opinion.
In declaring this conclusion I do not
leave out of view the claim, which is so
frequently asserted, -that a man Is more
likely than a woman to reach a hard
headed understanding of a given situation
upon which their respective senses may
operate â that his sentiments and emotions
would have lesa play in the formation of
his impressions. . .
Those who subscribe to this opinion ac
count for man's superiority upon theories
of inherited temperamental advantages,
and the- claim that he is vouchsafed a
closer experience in and intimacy with,
those elements which deal with the actu
alities rather than the sentimentalities of
human existence. In other words, the
claim is that by inherited qualities and
worldly training, a man is better qualified
to scientifically resolve Into facts the evi
dence of things which are presented to his
senses than are the members of the
gentler sex. . â¢ . .
In support of this theory it is further
pointed out that these disparities between
the sexes have continued so long that
man's advantage is fundamental, and
that while the enlarged range of woman's
activity in the material affairs of life in
recent days is calculated to neutralize
these disadvantages in women that never
theless nothing but the slow process of
time will cause the disparities to disap
pear.
It is probably not to be denied that- by
virtue of man' 1 ! nature, mental tendency to
deal with realities rather than sentiments,
and hfs superior worldly training, he has
a natural advantage over, woman in deal
ing with secular affairs,, and from that
should be elicited from a twofold as
pect of the question presentedâ first,
where the element of sentimental interest
is wanting in the giving of testimony, and
second, where that element is present. I
shall give my views in that order.
Under the flrdt aspect I must venture an
unqualified affirmative answer to the
question. Broadly speaking, I believe that
the testimony r.t a woman is as depend
able as a man's, and that it will serve
eouallv the interests of truth."
IS A woman'? testimony as trustworthy
as a man's?"
From my point of view, and for the
purposes of differentiation, the answer
born liars and cannot speak the
truth; the same may be said of some men.
My experience has taught me that no
general rule w'll apply to either sex. I
have met many women whose word was
worth far more to me than that of many
men. Likewise, have I met many men
whose word w.as verity itself. Perjury is
committed more often than any crime
known to the law, but it is impossible to
say which sex is most prone to commit it.
With some people lying Is a disease, in my
opinion as prevalent with one sex as with
the other. The female liar, though, seems
to lie from the mere lust of lying. Sex.
however, cannot govern the credence to
be given to testimony. I find that a care
ful observation of the manner of the wit
ness, the expression of the face, together
with the movements of the hands and
feet, the intonation of the voice and the
presence or absence of the liar's hacking
cough and clearing of the throat are tests
of the greatest service in determining the
verity of testimony. CARROLL COOK.
TWOFOLD ASPECT TO BE
CONSIDERED.
WHETHER a woman's testimony
is as trustworthy as a man's de
pends upon the woman; also up
on the man. Some women are
accuracy to a marked degree. Yes, I re
peat that in all my experience as a crimi
nal lawyer, prosecuting officer and Judge
I must 'say that a woman's sense of per
ception, and particularly as to identifica
tion, is as perfect if not more so than
that of a man. C. T. CONLAN.
NO GENERAL RULE CAN
APPLY.
Upon a comprehensive view of the sub
ject It is my opinion that the sexes are
equally trustworthy as witnesses.
"WILLIAM P. LAWLER.
Such Illustrations might be multiplied
to an extent as to leave in doubt the
question whether they represent the ex
ceptions or the rule.
Some time since a domestic, to whom
her female employer had become quite
attached, was on trial on a charge of
having committed grand larceny of the
property ; of her mistress, which under
the facts of the case involved a serious
betrayal of confidence. Upon the em
ployer's clean-cut testimony the unfor
tunate girl was convicted. 'And yet be
tween the sessions of the trial and with
a rare kindliness, the former employer
was seen to be yielding consolations to
the discredited employe. This witness
would undoubtedly have been gratified If
the defendant had been spared, but that
gratification found no expression in the
convincing story she told to the Jury.
The defense In a recent rather desper
ate cas'e Included a claim that on account
of an affront offered to the affianced
sweetheart of the defendant by the de
ceased in the case the defendant was
moved to a state of mind which culmin
ated in homicide. The opposing claim,
was that no such affront was offered by
the deceased. The affianced sweetheart
was placed upon the witness stand In the
confident expectation that the claim, of
the defense would be sustained by her
story. It soon became apparent, how
ever, from the distressed manner of the
witness that the expectation would not
be realized, and consequently the claim
ended in theory.
But this- is not always so. Woman's
conscience is frequently seen to be tho
master even over the claim of ties of
blood and affinity or the pressure of other
sentiments. Several Illustrations may be
cited: Two boys were Jointly charged
with crime. They were either jointly in
nocent or jointly guilty. The respective
mothers appeared as witnesses. One sub
scribed squarely to what was afterward
demonstrated to be a bogus alibi. The
other faltered and finally declined .to give
countenance by false testimony to the
effort to save the lads from merited
punishment. And to an observer the
conscientious mother was the more gen
uinely concerned over the outcome of the
trial.
I have some reserve in my answer to
the second aspect of the questionâ where
the element of sentimental Interest la
present in the giving of testimonyâ Is a
woman as trustworthy as a man?
I am possessed of a spirit of reserve be
cause I believe that where t,he maternal
instincts are involved a woman's testi
mony is apt to be subject to some legiti
mate discount. The disposition to come
to the rescue of an offspring 1 , whether the
latter be culpable or not, is pronounced
In many mothers. It may be said of
courts of justice that this experience la
not unusual and it may also be pointed
out that the men upon "whom the duty
rests to weigh such testimony In the In
terests of truth and Justice rarely resolve
it against the mother's story of an alibi
or whatever the particular defense may
be. Daughters and sisters sometimes
lend their testimony against the dictates
of truth to save the family honor from
the felonious taint. The laws of affinity
likewise make responsive though illegiti
mate demands upon female witnesses.

standpoint has a superior claim upon the
science of truth. But I claim that under
the law of compensations and for other
reasons this advantage Is overcome. For
the very absence of worldliness in human
nature increases the disposition to tell the
truth, and this assumption. Joined to the
fact that -woman's more delicate percep
tions enable her to form more Impres
sions from what she sees and hears and
thus to contribute with fidelity the small
details which form so Important a part in
the determination of facts and the scien

supposing that he was interested in my

that I was exceedingly anxious to find or
secure. Then he told me that in his wan

eggs, and finding that they were fresh he
had eaten them, six in all. Then it was
my turn to talk, and when I had told him
that the eggs were very rare and that I
would willingly pay $100 apiece for them
he looked disgusted, and actually turned
pale. He had been having rather a naid
run of luck and felt very sorry, of course,
that he had unawares partaken of such a
high-priced breakfast. He thought he
might be able to find another nest there
abouts and offered to furnish me six eg?s
of the same species for a sum consider
ably less than $600, which offer I accepted.
We hunted together all that day an-1

Three months later I made a similar find
myself, but at a place 300 miles distant

It is a strange moral code these fisher

There is a mystery, too, about many of
the wrecks. One day a ship is seen sailing
safe on her way. The next day, perhaps,
fragments come ashore to tell of her fate,
but the manner of her loss may never be
known. The recent mysterious loss of the
steamer Lucerne is a case in point.
About the same time as the Lucerne,
and a few miles nearer St. Johns, a
schooner or square-rigged sailing craft,
met her doom under equally mysterious
circumstances. No clew has been obtained
to her Identity. All that is known is that
her wreckage in splintered form strews
the shore of Blackhead, three miles from
St. Johns. . . . _...
Another mystery identified with Baca
lieu, where the Lucerne went down, was
the loss of the steamer Lion,; fifteen years
ago. She left St. Johns for Trinity, a seven
hours' run. On a brisrht, clear winter's
night she disappeared and the body of a
woman passenger, floating on the tide the
next day, was the sole evidence from then
until now of her taking off.
A few years later the same locality
chronicled another mysterious disappear
ance, that of the schooner Emmeline. She
was bound from St. Johns; to Twillingate,"
carrying a lot of fisher folk. She "was
seen by another vessel, going the con

to Bacalieu tickle, or strait, which sepa

was about 10 p. m. and the next morning,
some raffle of deck gear was washed
ashore, that being the sole proof that

In the history of the Roman Catholic

comparatively modnn. It was not until
the end of the twelfih century, at the so
called Lateran Council, that in order to
ftop the many abusej which accompanied
the election of the Popes this duty was
henceforth intrusted to the College of
Cardinals, thÂ» constitution of which, with
slight alterations, has existed from that
time, when the primitive election by pop
ular vote and later" by the clergy only,
was restricted to even smaller limits in
the hands of the seventy Cardinals nor
mally forming the Sacred College. As the
repositories cf this august privilege, in
an age when the papacy enjoyed undis
puted political power and preponderance,
Jt can be understood that the Cardinals
wielded an influence which serves to ex
plain the importance accorded to their
personality in the history of the past.

Peter is shorn of its temporal power, it
still exists, and the electing of a new oc
rupant still excites the interest of thÂ«
world. A reflection of the old political
influence enjoyed by the Cardinals still
lingers round the conclaves in which the
traditions of the papacy are handed down
to one more successor of St. Peter, and
It is doubtless with this view that the
Italian element stil! prevails so strongly
in the Sacred College though the cosmo
politan character of that body nowadays
offers a singular contrast to the past.
Only half of the Cardinals are now
of Italian origin. Austria, Germany,
France and Poland are well to the fore.
An Ecclesiastical Democracy.
It is not only cosmopolitan but essen
tially democratic, and thus an exponent
cf that church which Is still to this day
a great republic wherein personal merit
may win even as high a place for its
possessor as it did in the days when the
poor Anglo-Saxon serf. Nicholas Brake
ppere, became Pope under the name of
Adrian IV. Just as according to Na
poleon, every French soldier carries a
marshal's baton in his knapsack, in the
tame manner every faithful son of the
church entering the priesthood may be
said to bear the red hat of a Cardinal In.
his cowl.
The Cardinals owe their appointment
solely to the Pope, who nominates them
at solemn functions known as consistories,
held in the Slstine Chapel at Rome.
A consistory may be divided Into two
ports, the secret and the public.
At the secret consistory the Sacred Col
lege Is questioned as to the creation t of
Cardinals. A chair Is placed at the right
hand of the Pope. All the Cardinals stand
ranged against the wall out of earshot
of his Holiness. In this chair the Dean
of the Sacred College first takes his se^at.
In a low voice the Pope mentions the
name of the prelate upon .whom the car
dinalate Is to be conferred, and asks
"Quid vobis videtur?" ("How seems thi3
to you?") One by one the Cardinals fol
low the Dean to the chair and the same
announcement and query are put to each-
Each has the privilege of answering,
"Place" ("It pleases me"), or "Non
place" ("It does not please me"). It Is*
rare, however, that any or even a consid
erable minority answer "Non place." The
St. Patrick's Cathedral, _ as the mother
church of Catholicity in this country and
the seat of Cardinal Archbishop Gibbons,
In the case of Cardinal Gibbons, Mgr.
Straniero and Count Mucciola were the
messengers from Rome. Archbishop Pe
ter R. Kendrlck of St. Louis, Mo., imposed
the biretta In the cathedral in' Baltimore
on June 30, 18S6, after a mass celebrated
by Archbishop Williams of Boston. ' The
Cardinal went to Rome and was vested
with the red hat and the title of Santa
Maria in Trastavere. .
Although Cardinal McCloskey was made
a member of the College of Cardinals by
Pcpe Pius IX, he received the red hat
from Leo XIII. Ke was summoned to
Rome at the death of Pius IX, but did
not reach there until after the election
of Leo, from whom he received his hat
and his title of Santa Maria Sopra Min
erva.
Mgr. Cesare Roucetti was the ablegate
and Count Marefoschi the member of the
Papal Guard who came- to this country
at the elevation of the late Cardinal Mc-
Closkey. The biretta was imposed by
Archbishop Bayley, then Archbishop of
Baltimore. The ceremony was perform^!
In old St. Patrick's Cathedral in Mott
street, on April 22, 1S75, being preceded by
a solemn pontifical mass, celebrated by
Bishop Loughlin of Brooklyn.
In the case of Satolli the investiture of
the zucchetta took place on December .19,
1S35, at Washington, and that of the biret
ta at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Baltimore
on January 5 following.
Immediately on the arrival of the mes
sengers at the residence of the new Car
dinal, the Noble Guard, at a private audi
ence informally summoned, presents him
with the zucchetta. Then the ablegate
Is introduced. Speeches are made by the
Cardinal and the ablegate, and the Cardi
nal is asked to fix a date for the bestowal
of the biretta.
It may be mentioned that the new prince
of the church is called upon to pay all
the expenses of the journey, as weil as
a fee of $2000 to the ablegate and of $1000
to the Noble Guard. - ,
In the case of Satolli. who was raised
to the cardinalate in 1895. only a member
of the Noble Guardâ the Marquis Sacri
pantiâ was dispatched from Rome with
the credentials, Mgr. Baretti, then resi
dent in Washington,- having been desig
nated by the Pope to act as ablegate on
that occasion.
If, however, the new Cardinal is sta
tioned or resident abroad, a member of
the Pcpe's household, usually a monsig
nor and a member of the Noble Guard.,
the famous Papal troop, are sent to bear
him the zucchetta, the biretta. and the
documents authorizing the investfture ol
the candidate with these minor insignia
of his new rank. The monsignor in this
capacity is known as the ablegate.
The Papal Messengers.
The Cardinals so proclaimed do not re
ceive their hats until the public session
of the next consistory, which may be
days, weeks or months later. If they
happen to be in or near Rome the Pope
meanwhile invests them at private audi
ences, -first with the zucchetta. or skull

from those worn by other ecclesiastics.
He then r>roclaims the names of the
new dignitaries, makes the sign of the
cress thrice, saying each time "In the
name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Holy Ghost," and with that the
secret part of the consistory is at an end.

the Pope makes an announcement, still
in Latin, which may be translated thus:

ANOTHER RED HAT COMMING
TO AMERICA.- "In vlevr of Dr. Koenlger's discovery
it will be well for every one to keep as far
away as possible from persons who cough

suffering from colds to gargle and keep
their mouths cleansed, but is that suffi

"On the other hand, germs are very
quickly disseminated by coughing and
sneezing, and the smaller the microbes
are the farther they are likely to spread.
Among such tiny microbes are those of
influenza and the plague, whereas among
the larger ones are those of tuberculosis

rolling hill and immediately adjoining
their lovely Arbor Villa grounds. In all
of the county there can be found no more
perfect location, with superb 'views,
making it among the finest residence sec
tions in the city. This thirty-five-acre
tract, under the close protection of Arbor
Villa, will always be the site. for the cot
tages, the homes of the little girls. .
The plans have been approved and the
first cottage has been erected. It has a
very pretty courtyard â in which will be
flowers and vinesâ with five little rooms
on each sideâ a reception room, a dining
room, a kitchen, a matron's room and a
guest room. The guest room is so built
that it may be quarantined in case any
of the little maids should develop a con
tagious illness.
The home is started on the basis that It
is a mechanics' home. In the cottage
there is room for ten children. Each lit
tle girl has her own sunny little room. It
has her little white bed in it, her bureau,
a chairâ a shelf for her books, or special
belongings â and under it hooks for her
clothes. This Is always her N roomâ for
this is her homeâ she has come to stayâ
and it is hoped that she will be so happy
In it that all her life long she will care to
come back to it.
Life In the new home has been carefully
planned, but the experiment is going to
move slowly so that the mistakes may bo
seen and corrected and the scheme grow
more perfect as time goes on.
Mrs. Smith makes religion the first es
sential of womanhood in the highest
sense. Education comes next and' - she
holds that a love of humanity, a rever
ence for all that . is good and pure will
spring from the union of the two. .
"It is no charity affair. We are plenti
fully endowed for all present needs. We
need no old clothes or packages of tea,"
said Mrs. Smith with a smile...*
Each cottage is to have its matron or
mother, who will have a regular monthly
allowance with which to run her little
home.* : ; :
"It is her . home," : says Mrs. . Smith,
"hers till she dies, if she wishes to make
it such, and when she gets frail she will
have an assistant, but no one is ever to

have some very young children there.

the experiment which Is being developed
among the East Oakland hills bids fair
to challenge the attention of the civilized
world.
The remedy* Is being quietly thought out
and practically worked out at Arbor
Villa. >:\ 'Â¦}'Â¦
The failure of all institution life for lit
tle girls is now universally acknowledged.
The machine system only serves to feed
and clothe them; it is disastrous to all
individuality and originality. It offers ab
solutely no home training for the little
girl who may possibly be the home-maker .
of the future. In the big institution. there
is no time to give the little girl the love
that her child heart craves. "There Is
not enough of anybody to go around."
She is living in an abnormal atmosphere,
Â¦where Individuality must of necessity be,
crushed out. The freedom which other
children enjoyâ the freedom in going to
and from schoolâ the change of seasons,
the holiday time â are all of necessity de
nied to the little Institution girl. Th9
training which comes from the household
.life â the sacrifices, the sorrows, the Joys
lived through In common â never comes
into her life at all. She is simply part
of a great machine system, anoj poor lit
tle girl, she carries its stamp 'all. her life.
Economy makes it necessary that she
should bo only a unit. In a great dormi
tory system; the little girl is never alone
with her dolls, with her plays. But be
yond all else, she knows nothing of the
duties Incident to the household of the
man of the working class. Yet that is
the position into which her life lines are
likely to lead her. The institution is
equipped with electricity and the other
appliances by which things are done for
great numbers in the quickest way. These
are not at all the methods which muat
prevail in the cottace of the poor man.
The little institution girl has never learn
ed to cook, to sew, to plan, to make things
do: she knows nothing about < the little
self-sacrifices, the thriftâ the economy,
which all make for the success, the hap
piness of the household of the ordinary,
working man. And beyond it all and
deeper than it allâ the poor little girl is
a starved little girlâ she has never had
a. home. All this is known to the scien
tific observers, to the philanthropists of
to-day. And the remedy?
Summer opens on a completed cottage,
the first of the series of cottages in which
Mrs. Smith is to try her experiment, and
it is to be dedicated to this new work.
This Mayday Is a noteworthy one to
those interested in Mrs. Smith's new hu
manitarian projectâ that of surrounding
homeless girls with a true home atmos
phere.
This love has stimulated her to work
out a solution of one of the great social
problems of to-day â the care of dependent
children, and especially of dependent
girls.
This sentiment is the index of her char
acter and the keynote is sounded in her
great love of little children.
True happiness comes in giving and en
joying the* givingâ so thinks Mrs. Smith,
the one behind the scenes of this drama
of Mayday hilarity.
The free kindergarten is a bright spot In
the lives of these poor children, and the
Mayday fete Is a bright spot In the memo
ries of their helpers.
But they are all children at heart, and
household cares are forgotten when they
enter into the kindergarten games or
weave the bright-colored mats or sing
their pretty songs.
The school week really begins for them
on Tuesday, when they turn out in full
force. Then these wise wee totsâ none of
them over 6 years old â will tell you that
they had to "tend the baby" or "wash the
dishes" or "mind the house" while mam
ma did the washing.
Many come from homes of poverty, and
most of them have to do chores and help
with the general work. Mondays the at
tendance is very smallâ there is scarcely
a handful in the large sunny schoolroom,
for Monday is washday.
The proceeds from these pastimes fur
nish pleasure and Instruction for the less
fortunate brothers and sisters of the Oak
land water front. Three large roomfuls of
children gather c'aily at the Oakland Free
Kindergarten and are taught the beauties
of industry and happiness.
Next on the programme comes the battle
of flowers. The children gather the rose
petals In baskets from the rose bushes,
and certain ones go up on the porches of
the house with the baskets and throw this
variegated snowfall of petals down on the
delighted children below, who pick up and
fight with all their might with these
eweet emblems of nature's prodigality.
In the court of Henry VIII and Eliza
beth great celebrations were held on May
day, and the Maypole dance was partici
pated In by the lords and ladies of the
court.
On May morning the people, headed by
the priests, would inarch in procession to
the woods, where all would garland them
selves. Then they would decorate the
longest pole tbey could find with May
flowers and finally return, chanting hymns
of thanksgiving.
The history ot the Maypole dance Is an
interesting one. It was originally a relig
ious rite in the ancient church of" Rome.
Now comes the Maypole dance that for
centuries has been reverenced and ob
served in "Merrie Olde England" as
sacredly as Christmas Is here.
The grown folks will not overlook this
opportunity for a frolic. One old boy has
not missed a May fete for years. "He
certainly spends his money free," and no
hapless little spendthrift feels for donkey
money in vain in his presence.
Mayday is the gift feast of the year
when Dame Nature delivers to her loving
children the key of summer and opens
wide our hearts to her lovely influences:
and the festival atmosphere of the Smith
grounds is well calculated to instill the
wish to give as one has been given unto.
Everything that can be done is being
done to make the young folks happy, for
Mayday is. of all the year, a children's
holiday.

"Not so!" quoth the Bumpkin, "it

The Wise Man marveled and held

they presently entered a Wood where
the Wise Man beheld a Small Bug
â¢wearing Yellow Stripes, like the re
galia of a Convict, sitting upon a lead
colored cone of lint, taking the air.
"Behold!" whispered the Book-

"Nay, nay!" besought the Bump

"Go to!" sneered the Wise Man.

the Same Breed came forth and
sought, one and all, to join the Wise

"Doth the Small Bug appear more

asked the Interested Bumpkin.
"Not so!" sobbed the Wise Man,

nine-tenths of the persons bitten by these
snakes die. All this goes to prove, of
course, that snake hunting is a real sport,
inasmuch as the hunte-1 sometinfes gets
back at. the hunter.
"For persons who enjoy 'snake stalk
ing," said R. L. Ditmars of the Bronx
Zoo, "I can recommend certain parts' of
South Carolina above any other section
of the United 1 States. For example, a
four-mile swamp near the little town of
Robertsville in Hampton County is a
snake's paradise. There be the snakes of
the South un'd the snakes of the North.
Every creeping thing is as the sands of
the sea for numbers. Portions., of the
swamp are overgrown with huge rushes
and portions with cane brake dovetailing
Into pine swamps, the trees running up
ttfty feet to the first limb and hung thick
with sage green mass. Under foot is a
bog alternating with slimy pools and
treacheroub morasses."
Night Is the very best time for catching
snakes, for it is then that the serpent
tribes uncoil themselves and glide hissing
about the swamp in perfect freedom. Ob
viously this sort of thing is not without
danger and after one trial of it the snake
hunter usually prefers daylight. In ihe
moonlight a haze floats above^the swamp
and it lies like" a silvery sea. Within It,
the pines are ghosts whose long beard*
sweep the pools, diamond backed rattlers
rear their ugly heads, racere, moccasins
and strange pink water snakes glide
noiselessly, and alligators keep up the.'r
,loud, uncanny bellowing.
In daylight the hunter rides in mounted
on a mule usually and clad in an armor
of heavy brown duck,, high top boots an-1
Stout flexible gloves. His weapons are a
bamboo sticK with a running noose of fine
copper wire at the end, and a second cane
furnished with a wire net. He always
carries a revolver, too, if he Is wise..
Across the mule's neck is balanced a
short cane stick and from each end of tho
stick dangles a good sized cotton bag.
These bags are for the snakes and if a
score of the squirming things are turned
ioose in each bag before the hunt is ove.\
it is all the same to 1 the mule. Like

. "Well, I bagged eleven snakes," boasted
Ditmars, as they set off.

the woolly headed guide over his- shoulder.
Between a negro and a^snake there is no
affinity, â¢â¢ arid "to the' darky a man who
hunts snake3 is in league with the powers
of. darkness. . Mr. Ditmars lately captured
a hog-nosed snake in a cottonfleld. The
negroes call these serpents "spreadin'. ad

ous, although the bite is about as bad as
the pinch of a Jersey skeeter. A hog

and his favorite role is playing dead. As
soon as' the naturalist laid hold of (he
tail of this terrible "spreadin' adder" it
gave one despairing flicker and apparent

â¢ "It's trafficking with Old Nick, but I've
got to brlns that snake back to life; I
n.eed him in my laboratory," remarked the
hunter. . Â¦
"Fo' Gawd sake, doan' yb' do it, boss."
pleaded the negroes who had gathered
around. The naturalist made a few passes
over the snake and warned the negroes
to move back, so the brimstone wouldn t
strike them. The snake seeing the coast

these shadows if you- watch sharply seem
to dart ahead in a straight line, with a

his way through the swamp along, deer
paths which wind in and out where a sin

A snake stalker, of course, only attempts
to take the more valuable and strange
specimens of serpents. : W,hen he catches
the gleam of the right sort of a coat
through the rushes,' or spies a fine moc
casin dangling from a limb over his head,
he halts and- cots into action with his

copper wires and seizes a snake with his
hands, grasping him well toward the head,
so that he cannot twist it "around and
thrust his fang into the hands.
It is not uncommon for a snake stalker
to bag.'a dozen moccasins around a single
pool. A few weeks ago Mr. Ditmars, in
cempany with his assistant, Mr. Snyder,
and a guide, was trekking in the swamp
near RobertsviHe.
In the middle afternoon .they were pro
ceeding slowly, single Hie, when Ditmars
loitered a moment in search of possible
catches.
"Go ahead; I'll overtake you!" he called
to the others. He began prodding the bog
with his bamboo stick and found it alive
wit.i moccasins. Some he captured wit.i
the wire nocse. One eluded him and slip
ped into the water. Ditmars followed the
snake down to his boot tops in the slimy
pool and dragged the moccasin forth.
After, two hours the hunter found himself
exhausted, sweating at every pore, but
happy in the possession of eleven cotton
mouth snakes. Â¦ â¢

faint red glow across the rushes. Now, to

hunted mercilessly, for he is valuable to
the medical man for his toxlnes and to the
naturalist because out of the eleven va
rieties in the United States the habits anl

In spite of'their deadly poison, the hunt
ing of venomous snakes is not any more
dangerous, If as dangerous, as the hunting
of boars or tigers or lions In India. The
reason is ttiat no snake, except the coral
snake, is likely to attack without provo
cation. The danger to students of snakes
is all In the familiarity bred by close ac
quaintance.
For example, less than a year ago pro
fessor Percy Selous of Michigan, a well
known 'naturalist, and. a cousin of the
\frlcan explorer and scientist of the same
name, was killed by the bite of a pet moc
casin. Professor Selous was in the habit
of taking the snake to bed- with him on
cold nights to keep it warm. One night
he got up In the dar:c to. put .the snake
back In its box and accidentally pinched
the moccasin's tall in the door. It turned
on him and sunk Its fangs into his flesh
and he died four days afterward from thÂ«
bite.
" Mr.' Ditmars relates that he one time
knocked a glass Jar out of his office win
dow and broke Itâ the same Jar in which
a rattlesnake had been kept. In gather-
Ing ur> the broken pieces he cut his hand
slightly. For -weeks afterward his life
was despaired of. His hand and arm
from finger tip to shoulder la to-day a
mass of terrtble scars.
A New York naturalist, blttea by a coral
snake in Florida last year, died within
forty-five minutes.
An attendant at the Smithsonian Insti
tution. Washington, ten years ago. in
transferring a rattlesnake from one Jar
to another, was bitten on the forefinger.
Although every known remedy was ap
plied he barely escaped death. For eight
years afterward on the return of the sea
son the finger sloughed off to the bone.

den or by a physician Interested In snake
toxlnes.
Hundreds of physicians in the United
States to-day tnnke a specialty of study
ing the poison* secreted bv the four ven
omous pnakca of this countrv. They com
pare the efCpcts of these poisons upon the
human BycteaT with the effects of the
toxines produced by the bacilli of various
diseases. In this manner they hope to
discover not only an antidote for snake
bite, but an aniitoxine for swamp fevers
and dozens of vther ills that ilesh is heir
to.
This demand for American snakes has
produced corresponding activity In the
business of snake hunting. The Smith
sonian Institution at Washington Is con
tinually on the alert for rare snecimens.
The Bronx lioo. recently sent a snake
stalking expedition to South Carolina un
der the lead of R. L. Ditmars. Mr. Dit
mars will soon start South on a second
pnake hunting trip. Dr. Weir Mitchell,
the author and scientist, Is one of the
best known students of snake toxlnes. It
is said that he sometimes has as many as
1000 snakes in his laboratory. Â¦ .
For various reasons poisonous snakes are
much less common in the country than
they were at one time. Still there are
enough to make things Interesting in
many localities. In Western Texas ranch
ersC families living in sod huts look un
der the bed dally for prairie rattlers and
only sleep eecure under a mosquito net
canopy. The iiolsonous snukes of the
United States are the rattler, copperhead,
moccasin and coral snake. The ftrst three
belong all to the same familyâ the crata
lidae and their poisons, so far as known,
are similar. The coral or Harlequin
snake Is found only in the South, and its
venom very much resembles that of the
deadly East Indian cobra. He Is brightly
banded, small, harmless looking, but very
vicicus. No certain remedy is known for

Memory of the Man That
Introduced Nicotine
To Be Honored.
THREE HUNDRED AND FTFTT
years ago. according to the allega
tions. Jean Nlcot Introduced tobacco
Into Europe. It was from his name
that the word "nicotine" was derived. The
French Government has Just made an ap
propriation for the erection of a bronze
statue to Nlcot. It is to be set up In front
of the main Government tobacco factory
in Paris. This French claim to the Intro
duction of tobacco Into Europe Is some
what at variance with the general suppo
sition that Sir Walter Raleigh first car
ried the fragrant weed across the water
to the old country. Raleigh smoked his
Virginia tobacco In the presence of Queen
Elizabeth In or about the year 1385.
Thirty-four years earlier, however, Jean
Nlcot. while French Embassador to Por
tugal, purchased some tobacco seeds that
had been brought over from Florida and
sent some of them to France. A year la
tor he presented some of the plants to
Catherine de t Medici, and together they
rooked the dried leaves in pipes.
It Is Interesting in this connection to re
cnll that when tobacco smoking was flrsr
Introduced into Europe, first by Nlcot and
later by Raleigh, It was extremely un
popular. It was called "the stinking
habit." and at least two Popes, Urban
VIII and Innocent XI. Issued decreer
against It- A Sultan of Turkeyâ In which
country smoking is now almost univer
salâmade It a. crime punishable by the of
fenders having their pipes thrust through
their noses. In Russia the noses of the
smokers were cut off. King James I of
England characterized smoking as "a
custom loathsome to the eye. hateful to
the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous
to the Iung3, and in the black, stinking
fume thereof nearest resembling the hor
rible Stygian smoke of the pit that is
bottomless."â Savannah News,

//.\\ introductions which appears In
lT~X> a London weekly Â£3000 Is the rec-
ord sum paid for the privilege of
shaking somebody's hand. This was the
price paid on one occasion for a hand
shake with the late Colonel North, and
that bluff old financier was so enraged
Fifteen Thousand Dollars That Was
Pa id for a Handshake.
But if all the tales one hears In the city
are true and Colonel North had under
taken to reimburse all the sums which had
been paid to obtain- his handshake he
would not have died so rich as he did.
Twenty, thirty and fifty pounds were sums
frequently paid for introduction to the
Nitrate King by persons who expected
him to help them to make their fortunes.
Needless to say, the money was practical
ly thrown away in most cases.
When E. T. Hooley was in the aenlth of
his meteoric success there was hardly a
â¢pushing man of invention or business who
did not seek the famous financier and the
consequence was Mr. Hooley had to
draw a cordon around himself to keep
wildcat schemers away or he would have
never had time to do business.
Mr. Hooley's intimate friends might
have amassed fortunes in fees for intro
ductions, for all sorts of sums were of
fered for such services. In one case Â£2000
was offered and declined, while a fee of
Â£400 was paid for a handshake with Mr.
Hooley by a Midland County merchant
who wanted his business floated only a
week or two before his crash came.
Of course. Mr. Hooley was no party to
these bribes, of which he may be totally
ignorant to this day. If half the bribes
that were offered for Introduction to the
meteoric financier were accepted Mr.
Hooley' s friends made more out of him
than he made out of himself.
It has been hinted that another famous
financier, who was madly sought after by
hundreds of people who wanted him to
finance their schemes, employed a friend
to accept all bribes offered in this manner
and that the two shared the amounts,
which were not infrequently very consid
erable.
The truth Is the financier discovered that
a certain friend was making a very hand
some thing by introducing to him people
with schemes and concerns and that he
threatened the friend with exposure un
less the friend supplied him with a com
plete list of the names of persons from
whom he had accepted bribes for Intro
ductions, and fully repaid all such sums.
The friend laughed at the threat, refused
to comply with either of the demands and
declared that he would give out that the
amounts had all been shared with the
financier himself If the latter mentioned
the matter to any one.
The financier dared not Imperil his repu
tation by being slandered In this way and
was therefore compelled to keep silent.
-But after his death, when It became
known that his friend had Introduced per
sons to him at so much, a time, the In
troducer, declared that it had always been
done with the knowledge of the financier,
who had had half of all the sums obtained
In this way. Hence the rumor, which Is
absolutely without foundation.
The Introducer admitted that he had
made- Â£SO0O by Introducing people to the
financier, which shows the bald improba
bility of his assertion that he only took
half the proffered bribes, since It was
hardly likely that Â£16,000 was forthcoming
for mere Introductions to the financier.

you all. It is up to you to do the
rest.
You must know how to wear the
bewitching things. It is too late In the
day to preach that feathers don't make
the bird. Everybody knows that. The
knowing it doesn't always do away witn
the difficulty.
Perhapn the pictures will help. That Is
what they are here lor. Study the lines
of the figure and remember that although
the model has a good figure by nature it
Â¦wouldn't be worth a cent to her if she
hadn't tlic knack of handling it and so
getting the full value out of every good
line in the cut of the gown. You can do
It. too.
Squint one eye and then take a quick,
generalizing glance to get the main out
line of the sr-ason's styles. Sleeves' mod
erately tight; bodice full, very full In
front and having a tendency to pouch;
skirt dose tilting about the hips, retreat
ing at the knees and flaring forward at the
feet; the bottom of the skirt a mass of
flutters and frills, reaching out behind to
a. moderate train.
In the first place, the gown has to be cut
to this outline. Beyond this the thing lies
In the way you put it on and hold it up.
Pull the pouch out in front and '>ull it
down when you put on the gown. Over
a straight-front corset it will stay in this
shape.
It is the fashion nowadays to hold up
the skirt. It makes a difference how you
do this. Some will tell you that it should
never be drawn to the front and others
'Â¦will tell you not to lift It in the back.
Imagine Bernhardt holding to either rule!
She of all women is complete mistress of
her clothes and she makes them express
her mood. They twine for her, they swish
for her, they cling or they flutter. If you
have any artistic Instinct you will hold
yours as you see fit to show the best lines.
Drawing a skirt back below the hips gives
the flat-front effect, in demand just now.
And in the case of the light summer fab
rics, which are a mass of ruffles about the
feet, you should grasp the skirt at such
a point, as to throw out an avalanche of
ruffles behind or toward one side.
The gpwns in the pictures are all organ
dies from the "White House and every
one of them is trimmed in black. That is
the fad of the season. Whether white,
pink, blueâ whatever the dainty tint of
the fabric may beâ the black is its con
trast. Bands of black lace are soen,
stripes of black embroidery, knots and
streamers of black ribbon. It is to a pale
color what salt is to the bread we eat. It
sharpens.
Two of these gowns are of white organ
die polka-dotted in black. One has very
close dots. Its yoke is low, sloping down
ward m front, a:id is of plain white ma
terial. Bands of black lace about two
Inches in width are the garniture. They
are laid in up and down strips on tha
yoke, radiating in all directions from the
neck. Two ziczass of the same lace run
around the bodli-e below the yoke and
two more border the skirt. Straight
bands of the laoe encircle the skirt higher
xip. dipping toward the front. Black satin
ribbon forms the belt and ties in front
"with long ends, and the same ribbon
makes a high choker stock with a fat
bow behind. "It is a delight to see how
the bow in the back of the neck once
more entering: It Is the most becoming
finish there is, especially to a slender
neck. As for the 1>. Us. they may be fas
tened clthrr back or front, as you like.
The only requirement Is that they dip
down in front to suit the military figure.
The other polka-dottcd gown has the
dots farther apart and, being lighter,
â¢would be all the more perishable. They
are as serviceable ac cobwebs, those
gowns, but you can't blame any girl for
Indulging if she has the price of the cob
web.
Three flounces of dainty black embroid
ered lace cive fullness to the bottom of
the skirt. The skirt overlaps them, in
two points, one to the back and one to
the front. Where it meets the lace nar
row black velvet ribbon forms the band,
and above this is another still narrower.
The same bands of ribbon finish cuffs and
reveres.
These reveres give a dressy finish to
the bodice. They are wide and, bordered
with the lace, they lie over the shoulders
In a 'dainty fluff. They meet at the bust
and there a rreat knot of turquoise vel
vet ribbon holds them. Its long ends. fall
to the knees. Lace falls over the hands;
& lace-covered stock fits tight to the
throat. Fancy for this gown a white

A most demur* little rown, one that

simple bands of embroidery, interlaced
with black velvet baby ribbon. These
trim the skirt vertically, they make a
pointed yoke, they border the sleeves.
One of the bands forms the belt, another
the stock and still another covers the
pleat of the waist, which is hardly more
than a shirt waist. The beauty of the
costume lies in its exquisite material and
its smartness of outline.

SUMMER GOWNS AND
HOW TO WEAR THEM.are 70.000 clocks set hy the
Government every- day when . the
il noon hour strikes in Washington.
In every large city throughout the
United States time balls at the same min
ute indicate the time to hundreds watch
ing for their fall, and hundreds of watches
are regulated to correspond with the sig
nal. This time service, comes from the
Naval Observatory in AVashlngton, and
its. original design was to furnish mar
iners- at seaboard cities with the means
of regulating their chronometers. Like a
great j many other Government institu
tions it has strayed from its original pur
pose, and now It serves another of more
general usefulness.- Â¦ .
The national time signal Is made prac
ticable by the standard-time system,
which has been adopted ln almost every
city in the United gtates. This system
divides the country into four parts along
the lines of longitude. Each division
represents approximately one hour in the
sun's course. One of these divisions be
gins at the seaboard and ends at a line
which passes through the city of Pitts
burg, in Pennsylvania. If you are travel
ing west, when you get to Plttsburg you
will set your watch back one hour. Con
tinuing west, when you reach ". North
Platte, ln Nebraska. : you will ' but your
watch back another hour, and at Ogden
you will find that it has gained an hour
more. These' divisions are known as East
ern, Central, Mountain and Pacific time.
When it is noon in Washington it is an
even hour in each of these other divisions.
The Naval Observatory contains a great
many fine instruments. It holds , what
was for a time the largest telescope in the
the United States.'the 23-inch Clark equa
torial, which cost $46,000 and was erected
in 1873. The Lick telescope in California,
36-inch, soon took from the Government
the distinction of owning the greatest tel
escope, and that In a few years was ex
ceeded by the ; Yerkes telescope, 40 inches.
With the Clark telescope Professor Hall
discovered the ] satellites ; of , Mars, and
there are otherr discoveries to its credit
In astronomical history. .. \ . %
The big telescope has nothing to do with
the time signal. The telescope used in the
business of measuring time is the transit
instrument, which la. much smaller. Here,
on each clear night, an observer watches
the movement of the stars. and by. their
aid corrects the big.Frodsham clock which
stands In the signal room. . In the making
of the observations the; web of the spider
plays an important part. Threads of cob
webs are not only ' fine but . wonderfully
strong for their fineness. They also pos
sess a remarkable stability, not being af-!
fected!by-moisture and neither expanding
nor contracting with the . changes m the
temperature. These threads are used to
celerates or retards the clock to be regu
lated by touching tbe pendulum with his
finger till the space measured shows that
the fractional difference Is just .09 of a
second. Than the clock Is ready for the
day's work.
All this takes place not too long before
the noon hour, so as to give the clock
little time to lose or gain. There Is a
sounder on top of the clock which steadily
ticks off the seconds loud enough to bo
heard in the adjoining room. At three and
a quarter minutes before noon, approxi
mately, the big clock Is switched Into the
telegraph circuit.
This signal clock has a toothed wheel di
rectly behind the wheel which marks the
seconds. The wheel Is divided Into sixty
spaces, but the tooth representing the
twenty-ninth second Is mlsglng, and so are
those representing the fifty-fifth, flftyr
sixth, fifty-seventh, flfty-elghth and fifty- '
ninth seconds. As this wheel revolves the
teeth come in contact with a spring which
Is in connection with the current, closing
the circuit and causing the sounder to re-,
spond. The twenty-ninth signal drops out,
and that intermission Indicates the ap
proach the half-minute. In the same way
an intermission of live beats Indicates tha
approach of the end of the minute. -'--

ute wheel touches the spring which closes
the circuit, and simultaneously tha timer

red ink makes a straight mark on the
paper which is fastened . around a cylin
der. In each of the two clocks is a cogged
wheel just behind .the dial, which turns
with the second hand. Each of the cogs
In turn touches a brass spring which
closes the circuit of a battery. An elec
tric Impulse from the battery passes
through the pen and by a mechanical ar
rangement causes it to make a horizontal
mark on the cylinder. Thus every second
is permanently recorded. The Frodsham
clock is also in circuit with this pen. A
cup" of mercury rests in the clock. It Is
connected with one pole of the battery.
The pendulum Is connected with the
other. As the pendulum swings it touches
the mercury ln the cup, closing. the cir
cuit and sending an electric impulse
through the pen. This Impulse also causes
the sen to be deflected and to . leave a
mark on the cylinder.
It is easy enough to set either of the
other clocks within a second of the
Frodshamâ to set the minute hand at the
eight-minute variation and the ' second
hand twelve seconds more. But the frac
tion of the remaining second must be
measured with great nicety. This Is done
by ' measuring the space . between the
marks on the cylinder with a prepared
graduated . scale which shows the differ
ence between the two beats to hundredths
of a second. The operator doing this ac-
make cross lines extending' at right angles
â¢across the field of view so as to divida it
into mathematical spaces. ,For this pur
pose it is found that spiders' webs gath
ered hear Â¦ Washington are more effica
cious than those which can ( be obtained
elsewhere.
All through the signal room as the day
observer. ? enters there is a buzz- as of
grasshoppers in the field on a warm sum
mer day. * This is' the voice of the chro
nometers, which fill long wooden cases.
All the navy's chronometers are sent here
to be regulated., Â¦ ._ .
Opposite the Frodsham clock are two
less costly timepieces which contain the
mechanism for sending out the time sig
nal. These ' timepieces cost between $700
and $800 apiece. " There is, > by the way,
another..-clock- in the observatory <for
which Congress "aid $10,000. It was in
vented by Dr. John Locke of Cincinnati in
1849 and was the first apparatus for trans
mitting time automatically. It is running
now, but its only use is to measure time.
. " The .Frodsham clock is set for sidereal
time. Between this and standard Eastern
time there _ is a difference of 8 minutes
12:09 seconds. Â¦ The other, clocks when they
are i regulated by the < Frodsham must be
made to vary just 8 minutes 12:09 seconds
from it. This is accomplished by an In
genious recording device for a fixed rate

Others, are from clergymen In all parts
of the country, who;state that they, are
praying for his success. It Is'-not made
clear why the clergv should be interested
in corn deals, but Mr. Phillips accepts the
letters arfd politely answers them. Many
farmers write him thanking him for what
he has done for it has enabled them to

mire him the most say: .

Upset Board Calculations.
It is something new for the Chicago
Board of Trade to have 'a" man upset its
calculations as Phillips has,' end' do it on
the bald proposition that he is right and
the speculators of the, board riot only
wrong; now but wrong for years past. Not :
even "Joe" Leiter gave the' board such a
stirring .up as this ycuns and seemingly

respected name and he was part of the
social life of the very men he was specu
lating against: He had his "fling," it 'was
expected, arid everybody enjoyed it â¢ but
the losers. * - ' Â¦ - m
Not so with Mr. Phillips. Except for
the notoriety^' sained last fall and his
present eminence in the pit, he is not. any
kin r l of a recognized factor In Chicago.
He has lived- a '-' modest! retiring, hard
working life and/ but. for his .remarkable
knowledge of eern.and his faith in. the
corn products might never have been

His Backer "Dan" Hill.
He has a friend from Morris by *the
name of "Dan". Hill. "Dan" is supposed
to own as manj acres of farm land in
Illinois as the famous Scully once did. He .
has money and land, .and abounding faith
In young Phillips. It was he who helped
Phillips to buy and hold until he got ready
to sell a little less than three million

hind the two are many rich and influential '

lieved the combination Â¦ has "too much

ought to know.
As to Phillips himself, he Is not an
enigma," ' although. many_ traders walk
about discussing him In most mysteriousl
tones. He is physically fragile enough to
be blown. away by a breath of wind, con
sisting of little else than a bundle of wire

THE SUNDAY CALL.

f-y EORGE H. PHILLIPS, whose dar-
I / ing operations on the Chicago
\\X Board of Trade are now en every
Western speculator's tongue, is
called the "bis little man" of the
crorn pit. He Is called "big" because of
his nerve and "little" because In physique
he could almost be confined in a pint bot
tle. Then, too. he is modest and retiring,
and, as compared with many of his op
ponents on the Doard of Trade, poor.
In his Nevember, 1900, deal in corn he
is supposed to have cleared U50.000. What
he has since made or lost Jn his fight in
the corn, oats and wheat pits is still a
matter of speculation. Those who pre
tend to know hi* Bjtuatlon assert that if
he defeats the bear movement now oper
ating against him he will be winner of
half a million dollars.
Mr. Phillips' phenomenal rise as a spec
ulator appears to be due to his willing
ness to break traditions of the board, his
utter lack of speculative fear and the al
most unlimited capital which he seems
to have at his command, and which Is
raid to come from a. syndicate of Middle
Iowa and Central Illinois farmers who
believe in legitimate tradingâ that Is, ac
tual buying, selling and handling of grain.
Led by Phillips, they have set themselves
againet the rich and poor traders .of the
board, who most delight in operating,
upon fictitious shortages or fictitious sur
pluses.
Took to the Grain Buiness Naturally.
Thirty-four years old, born in Morris,
111., Mr. Phillips became an elevator boy
in his father's storehouse In Morris while
still a school boy. He went to Chicagp as
soon as he was free from school and
worked at anything his hands found to
do. He preferred city life to that of the
country and announced his determination
never to return to Morris, except as a
visitor. His father was" a grain dealer
and he showed a fondness for the busi
ness himself, so that after being in Chi
cago a short time he found himself work-
Ing with the corn Inspectors of the Alton
and Eurlington roads. He spent his days
about the tracks of these companies and
became familiar with every detail of corn
Inspection and the nature of the cereal.
Later he was a buyer for the house of
George A. Seaverns & Co., in the corn
market, and finally became a commission
merchant on his own account, having a
very limited capital, but a wide experi
ence in the nature of corn. He had also
the belief, that through fictitious opera
tions the bears kept the price of corn too
low in the Chicago market, and that it
could be maintained higher if any one
dared to make the fight.
He proved the truth of his opinion by
entering what has become known as the
"corn deal of November. 1900," without
a dollar to control the market, and yet
having the entire product of corn then in
sight under his thumb. Arrayed against
him were men who count their millions
on their fingers â men of long heads and
shrewd ability as traders. He outwitted
hem all. His head was the longest, his
ierve the greatest, his thorough mastery
af the details of the business too much for
ais opponent*.
Depends on the Farmers.
It I* a characteristic of the man in his
Dpcrationsâ that of fix months ago and
he present oneâ that he depends upon the
armer for his guidance, and not upon
government or other crop reports. His
â¢orreepondeace with the actual producers
jf corn covers every State in the Union
kvhere there is a corn field or a granary.
lie is quoted as saying: '.*:',
*"1 do not care a fig for the Government
reports or the statistics sent out by re
porters. I have nothing to eay about
them, but I do not want them. I want to
know what the farmer has to say about
the supply, and I want Hhe information
Crom him direct. Then I am ready to
act."
Evidently the farmers informed him
tru'y in the "November deal,' 1 for be
caused every big: corn operator on the Chi
cago Board of Trade a big,loss and came
out a heavy .-.inner himself. He acted
fairly in his winning, too, In the face, of
the fact that many of the operators whom
he had at his mercy had endeavored In
ways not too scrupulous In nature to ruin
him by sudden calls for big margins. He
Sid not cause a single failure on the
Board of Trade in his "November deal,"
and in the present battle his conduct has
been so aboveboard that many brokers
are calling those "gray wolves" who on
last Monday week called on him for mar
gins of 2^4 cents a bushel on oats, 4U
peats on corn and 7% cents on wheat Of

who formerly conducted the Lamolle
House. He died several years ago, leav
j ing an estate valued at about $50,000. One
half of this was given to the widow and
the balance to two children. Mrs. Lagrue
was considered a good matrimonial catch
and several Frenchmen "set their caps"
for her. The affections of Hermelin were
returned and an engagement entered into.
Mrs. Lagrue decided to have their prop
erty rights definitely understood before
the marriage. He was to make some
valuable Improvements on her property
and she was to give him only a share of
her estate. Suddenly a coldness came

Then she filed the breach of promise suit.
In her complaint she declared that for
two years she had been engaged to Her
melin arid stood ready to marry him at
all times, but he had refused to keep his
part of the contract.
This brought Hermelin, who Is a man
of wealth, to time. He at once sought
negotiations with Mrs. Lagrue. He told
her he had a wife and children in France,
from whom he had not been divorced.
Thus he could not marry her, and he
asked time for a trip to France. Mrs.
Lagrue surprised him by saying she had

B) W. Cavanaugh was asked to-night
whit he thought of the signed statements
of the clergymen affirming their faith in
Clark. He said:
Mayor Clark details his record on the
poolroom question as establishing his po
sition and closes his statement as follows:
It is not the Bee'a business." â¢ but lt would
seem that a committee composed of these five
clergymen, particularly after the statements
they have signed, would be the very kind of a
committee Mayor Clark would court. The $1000
is still in the California State Bank and the
editor of the Bee, Into whose hands lt was
entrusted, proposes to leave it there until noon
of Monday, May 6. It is a public calamity
that the orphans cannot get it. It would do
more good that way than to keep it in bank
Mayor Clark makes no other answer to
the $1000 offer than to show these letters
from the clergymen and to reaffirm all
that he has said respecting Daroux and
Cavanaugh. He also presents a letter
from Chief of Police Sullivan and Cor
poration Counsel H. W. Johnson, Â¦whose
sincerity, it should be said, has not been
questioned even by. Clark's enemies, in
which they declare that their Instructions
from' Clark were always that they should
proceed against the poolroom men and
the gamblers. "With respect to the $1000
offer to prove the charges on the part
of those making thtm the holder of the
stake remarked to-night:
SACRAMENTO. April 27.â Mayor George
H. Clark took his turn at the bat this
afternoon by presenting statements signed
by Rev. Charles . L. Miel, Rev. A. B.
Banks, Rev. Father Qulnn and Rev. S. J.
Carroll, in which they decline to heed thi
charges uttered against his official con
duct by Daroux anu Cavanaugh, or to sit
as judges in the determination thereof.
The special significance of the ministerial
confession of faith is that yesterday after
noon $i000 was placed in bank to be drawn
at the order of those clergymen if those
accusing Mayor Clark of connection with
the poolroom.3 did not supply the clergy
men with proof of the truth of tho
charges.

WESTERN TOUR OF THE PRESIDENT
SAN DIEGO. April 27.â Preliminary
work Is In progTegs at Picacho on what is
expected to be one of the most extensive
mining developments in the United States.
Senators Morgan of Alabama and Jones
of Ne\-ada, and ex-Senators Pettijjrew
and Dorsey are the persons interested and
they are preparing to put up a mining
plant that will be double the capacity of
the Golden Cross plant at Hedges, which
has 140 stamps In operation. ; The Golden'
Crosa is claimed to be the most extensive
Jow grade mining plant in the United
States, and If the new mill is to be twice
as large it is easy to realize its extent
and importance.
"The Senators own a mountain of ore
at Picacho." said County School Superin
tendent Baldwin, who has just returned
from that district "It is similar to that
lound at Hedges, where the supply is al
most inexhaustible, but it is of a low
grade and the only way it can be worked
profitably Is in large quantities, such as
the projectors contemplate. It would be a
waste of money to put up a small stamp
mill for the ore Is not rich enough to make
such a venture profitable, but it can be
mad. to pay wc-11 in a mill that will crush
many tons a day. A large force of men
are now at work sinking the main shaft
In the mountain.
"Picacho is 26 miles north of Tuman, on
the eastern border of this county, and
the plant will be located on the western
bank of the Colorado River, bo that a sup
ply of water will be easy to obtain. At
the Hedges camp lt is necessary to pump
water from the river for a. distance of
eigrhteen miles to the mines. This draw
back will be overcome by the Senators,
'ihelr mountain of gold ore is located
about five miles back from the river and
men are now setting stakes for a railroad
to be built from this place to the mill.
Stakes are aJso being: set for a railroad
from the mill to the Southern Pacific road,
twenty-six miles distant. It would mean a
l>!g task to haul in the machinery and
supplies by wagon and a railroad is con
sidered the cheaper way.

business. Senator Jones and Senator Dor
sey were at Ficacho last week and gave
directions for the work,"

WASHINGTON, April 27.â The Inflation
of David B. Hill's boom for the Democrat
ic nomination for the Presidency In 1904
has begun. It has already been announced
that the former Senator will make a tour
of the Southern States this fall and plans
are now being perfected for carrying his
campaign for nomination into the West
ern States next year. The arrangements
are being made with the knowledge and
apparently with the approval of Hill, al
though they ostensibly originate w th the
Democracy of the State. of Washington.
The plan is shown In a letter received by
every Democratic and Populist United
States Senator and Governor from the
Western States and every member of the
Democratic National Committee in the
same region. The signer. George Hazzard,

Germans Fight Chinese.
LONDON, April 27.â A Reuter dispatch
from Peking Bays the headquarters staff
nas received a telegram from a British
officer accompanying the expedition to
the effect that on April 23 the Germans
crossed into Shansl through the Kouk
nau and Chanchengllu passes ln pursuit
of the retreating Chinese, whom they fol
lowed eighteen miles, fighting a sharp ac
tion. The French trooDS remained ln oc
cupation of the passes. The Germans
returned April 25 and the French handed
over the passes to them and returned to
their previous outposts. The Germans
are said to have had four men killed and
five officers and eighty â¢ men wounded.

r 'I have but little Information regard
ing the famine," the Chinese Minister
said to-day. "I know it is extensive and
that millions of people are involved, and
to save them from starvation and death
it is absolutely necessary that Immediate
relief measures be taken. The Imperial
Government has done all that it could,
but foreign aid is necessary, and it will
be gratefully accepted."
WASHINGTON. April 27.-Wu Ting
Fang, the Chinese Minister, is earnestly
hopeful that the American people will
promptly answer LI Hung Chang's appeal
for funds to relieve the distress prevail
ing in China. A letter describing the dis
tressing conditions existing in the prov
ince of Shensi, Â¦where the court has es
tablished its residence, was recently re
ceived by the Minister, and .he and the
attaches of the legation, as well as Chi
nese subjects in the United States, con
tributed as large sums as their meana
would permit, which was expended in aid
of their unfortunate countrymen. Th9
Imperial Chinese Government recently di
rected the expenditure of a large sum
for the benefit of the starving, but its- re
sources are less than they were before the
Boxer outbreak, and it is unable to give
the measure of relief necessary for the
saving of thousands of lives.

mander is regarded favorably here, as it
is believed these ruffians deserve the se
verest punishment.

WASHINGTON, April 27.â The
President has appointed Col
olnel Merritt Barber of the
adjutant general's depart
ment and Major Oscar F.
Long of the quartermaster's department
brigadier generals of volunteers on ac
count of their long and faithful services
during the campaign in the Philippines.
Major Long has had charge of the trans
port service at San Francisco and Colonel
Barber rendered important service at the
headquarters of General MacArthur at
Manila.
As second lieutenant and A. D. C. to
the colonel commanding the Fifth Infan
try ln the Indian campaign of 1877, Gen
eral Long won a medal of honor for most
distinguished gallantry ln action against
Indians at Bear Paw Mountain. Having
been directed to order a troop of cavalry
to advance and having found both officers
killed, he voluntarily assumed command
and under a heavy fire from the enemy
advanced the troop to its proper position.
Some weeks since he was mustered out
as lieutenant colonel of volunteers, and
several newspapers obtained the incorrect
impression that he had been obliged to
resume the rank which he held at the
beginning of hostilities. His promotion
now to the rank of brigadier general is
conclusive proof that his services are ap
preciated by. the President and War De
partment.

KEW YORK, April 27.â The third inter
nal iona.1 chess match by cable ended to
day In a draw. By 6 o'clock this evening
Jour gajnes had been finished, of which
*-2'ch side had scored two. The Ameri
cans then offered a draw on the two re
xnaininp boards, ar.d hardly had the mes-
Kage been transmitted when a similar of
fer wsje received on this side. If the Eng
lishmen had submitted the game to ad
judication they would have probably been
awarded the second game and thereby
tli*Â» match.
The play to-day was very eventful and
contrary to all expectations. The Ameri
cans met the first reverse on board No.
5. where Hunt cf Princeton with his thir
ty-flrst move sealed on Friday had also
s-ealcd his fate. His thirty-sixth move
hastened the catastrophe, but even other
moves could not have saved his game.
The defeat of Perry had been conceded.
Yet by dint of stouteEt resistance he de
ferred the disaster and not until the flfty
tixth move did he acknowledge that he
was beaten. The two unfinished games
â¢were: Falk of Columbia against Wiles
of Cambridge, and Keeler of Columbia
against Wright of Cambridge.
Fall: had a very good position, which
looked like a eafe draw, but by a care
loss use of pawns he compromised his
pame and had to sacrifice a pawn in or
der to prevent the hostile king from
breaking into his camp. Keeler had a
very good game throughout the day. but
his attack came to a Ftandstlll and the
position had been greatly simplified.

WITH THELU RESCTJEH3
General Young's address on "Our New
Possessions" attracted much interest by
reason of the prominent part he has taken
throughout the fighting in the Philippines,
where he was In command of the cavalry.
He said that before the war with Spain
and the British-Boer war in South Africa
predictions were made by many writers
that the day of cavalry was over. They
said that the infantry, with long-range
rifles and rapid and deadly fire action,
made the use of cavalry suicidal. Actual
practice in the Philippines proved that in
stead of cavalry having had its day it
was efficient as one of the most formid
able) branches of warfare.
Senator Fairbanks closed the Bpeech

yourself, was duly received and I regret very
much to find that my duties here, prior to leav

Grant birthday banquet on the 27th inst. It
would have been a great pleasure for me to be
able to Join with you and the members of your
as'ociation in honoring the memory of Gen
eral Grant, and I wish to assure you that I
appreciate the courtesy of the Invitation.
Please convey my moat cordial greetings to
those assembled at the banquet and believe
me very sincerely yours,
WILLIAM McKINLEY.
Regrets From the President.
The President's letter of regret was as
follows:
All the slandem you have teeen against me
originated away from -where , I was. The only
foundation waa from the fact that I wai or
dered to remain at Fort Henry and send the
expedition .under Major General Smith. This
was ordered because General Halleck received
no report from mo for near two weeks after
the fall of Fort Donelson. The same occurred
with me. I received nothing from him. The
consequence was I apparently totally disre
garded his orders. The fact was he was order
ing me every day to report the condition of
my command. I was not receiving the orders,
but knowing my duties and reporting dally,
and when anything occurred to make It neces
sary two or three times a day. When I was
ordered to remain behind it was the cause of
much astonishment among the troops of my
command and also disappointment. I never
allowed a word of contradiction to go out from
my headquarters. You need not fear but what
I will come out triumphantly. I am milling
no wires, as political generals do, to alvance
myself. I have no future ambition. My 'object
is to carry on my part of this war successfully,
and I am perfectly willing that others may
make all the glory they can out of it.
ULYS.
General Dodge presided. He read a let
ter of regret from President McKlnley
and another from Mrs. Julia D. Grant, the
latter expressing regret that her health
would not permit her to be present. All
the guests sang the national songs. The
menu card contained copies of a letter
written in the excitement of a battle, on
the field, by General Grant to his wife.
The souvenirs were pyramids of Imitation
cannon balls surmounted by a cross of
gun swabs, oh which were tiny flags. The
letters in the menu booklet were copies
of letters loaned by Mrs. Grant and never
before published. In a letter dated at
Savannah, Ga., March 29, 1862. General
Grant wrote:
The guests of honor were Ulysses S.

News has been received and confirmed
from Warsaw that Count Tolstoi is to be
banished from Russia and take up- his res
idence in Paris. .
The correspondent interviewed a high
official, who said nothing was known here
officially in regard to. the alleged combi
nation of the United States, France ana
Russia to compel Germany to reduce her
Chinese claims. .... ".V
"The whole story Is absurd, ho said.
"If the claims must ba scaled, Russia
should be the first to- begin, since shÂ»
makes the largeBt claim. Germany can
verify the correctness of hers, mark by
mark." ' _, ,
Discussing the sources. of China's .bor
rowings, the official referred to said:
"The United States authorities have
been Informed that many rich private
Chinese are ready to lend money to the
Government. It Is also expected that
American and French investors would do
bo and, perhaps, English and German
money. There can be no question of one
nation taking advantage through lending
money to China." .
Andrew D. White, the United States
Embassador, and Mrs. White returned to
Berlin from Italy last night. . ,
Tolstoi Will Be Banished.
The canal bill is still dragging in the
Diet. One of the Conservative leaders,
Baron von Sedllt. is opposed to the bill.
The Conservative -Herald Is opposed to it.
The Centrists this week proposed to the
Government a compromise measure,
which the Emperor rejected. The Mid
land |canal Is entirely omitted. The Gov
ernment declared it was Impossible to ac
cept it. The committee now freely con
fesses the design not to dispose of the
bill before its members know precisely
how the new tariff bill promotes Agrarian
interests. The Hamburger Nachrichten
says the original Government proposal fix
ing the maximal and minimal duties has
been abandoned. In the Diet a new Agra
rian measure was introduced directing -the
Prussian Government to form an internal
colonization board in every province,
composed of two-thirds Agrarians, and
one-third officials, for the purchase of
large bankrupt estates and to sell them
again in small lots. At the beginning
each board .gets 12,000,000 marks for capi
tal, but this amount can be increased.
Dr. Miquel, Minister of Finance, said such
a plan was not acceptable to the Govern
ment. "
Canal Bill Still Drags.
Although the Emperor and Count von
Bulow strongly favor the German East
Africa Railroad, there seems little chance
that the bill will pass; certainly not in its
present shape.
The Dowager Empress Frederick haa
sent the Countess von Perponcher to
Qrelshotm to express sympathy with the
families of iho victims of the explosions
thorn nnd distribute gifts. The health of
tho Downger Empress just now la fairly

Tho Vosslsche Staltung, commenting on
the Socialist May 1 proclamation, points
out that revolutionary appeals are miss

Weekly Call $1 pep Tear
lady's, UTnI
Has been rudely defined by some cynic
as "slops and sweets." And after all
there's more truth than poetry in the
definition. Ice cream and cake may
satisfy the palate, but they are far from
satisfying to the stomach, which requires
that food be nutritious first and nice
afterward. By, careless eating women
pave the way for stomach "trouble,"
and its kindred miseries. . .
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov-
ery is confidently commended as a
cure for diseases of the stomach and
other organs of digestion and nutrition.
By curing diseases yrt}ich prevent the
assimilation of food it enables the body
to. be built up and strengthened, in the
only way known to nature â by food
digested, and assimilated. .
Â«I*or twelve long months I suffered untold
misery," writes Mrs. Mollie Colgate, of Ran-
dolph, Charlotte Co. r Va. "No tongue could ex- %
press the pain that I endured before I com-
menced taking Dr. Pierce's medicine. I was
not able to do anything at all. Could not eat
anything except bread and teaâ or if I did the
top of my head hurt eo it seemed it -would kill
me; with all. that I could do it would burn like
fire. But now, since using your 'Golden Med-
ical Discovery ' and ' Favorite Prescription,' I
can eat a little of almost anything I want, and
can do a (rood day's work . as well as anybody
' can. Am better than I have been for years."

Publication Office <-^^^^^^> Market and Third, S. F.
OF" the thousands â one might
even say millions â who have
enjoyed the delicious music of
Sir Arthur Sullivan's operas only
the few who are musically culti
vated have realized that this art
cf his, which Appears bo gracefully spon
taneous and bo easily melodious, is in re
ality the result of Intense application, se
vere training and the expenditure of an
amount of intellectual energy compared
â¢with which that, displayed by a Prime
Minister or Admiral of the fleet Is child's
Play.
Few trained musicians, I think, will
question the truth of this statement, for
they know what the labor of orchestra
tion â and such orchestration as Sullivan's
âmeans; let those who are untrained try
to Imagine for a moment what is the na
ture of the task which the composer sets
himself when be sits down to write mel
ody and orchestral accompaniment for
even the simplest ballad. They will con
fess, I think, as Mr. Disraeli once con
fessed to Sullivan himself, that they have
not the slightest conception of the method
of attack and presentation; they could as
soon form a mental picture of the size of
those ether atoms Â¦whose diameter we
know to be less than one one-hundred
thousandth of an inch (but how much less
we know not), or of the mass of Arcturus,
Â¦which, I believe. Is roughly calculated to
be seventy times that of the fading star
we call the sun.
â¢ â¢ â¢
It was only the other day that Sullivan
died, and the grass was hardly green upon
his grave before he was followed by
I>'Oyley Carte, his friend and comrade of
many years. Of the famous trio who did
so much to lighten life for bo many only
Gilbert Is left, and he now is approaching
to three-score years and ten; soon will he
be gathered unto his fathers, and who,
then, shall make song and music for the
English epeaklng world? Oh, yes, we shall
have tragic writers a-plenty; Phillips,
with his undoubted gift of high poetic
seriousness; Swinburne, with his fatal ple
thora of words â "a hundred where one
â¢would do," as Matthew Arnold so well
said of him; Watson, with his passion,
limited In range but sincere and Intense.
All these will be with us to remind us
that man that Is born of woman Is born
tinto sorrow. Just as If we really needed
to be continually reminded of that? I
ehould not mourn greatly the departure
or the silence of these modern tragic
poets; Indeed, I could make shift to get
along very comfortably without them,
having Sophocles and Shakespeaxe. But I
<3o mourn Â¦when time casts his envious
dart at the man who is at once both hum
orist and poet, for he happens along so in
frequently In this oddly constructed
world. Such a man was Hogarth In paint
ing, and such a man was Sullivan in
music. When F.hall we look upon his like
again!
â¢ â¢ â¢
The Btory of Sullivan's life has recently
been simply but Interestingly told by
Arthur Lawrence (Stone, Chicago). His
father (a bandmaster) was an Irishman
and his mother came from an old Italian
family named Rlghi. Whence came his
Â¦wit and whence his musical faculty are
too clear to need discussion. Everything
In the boy's environment favored the de
velopment of his immense musical talent.
At eight years of age he could play almost
*very wind instrument in his father's
band, at twelve he was admitted a chor
ister at the Chapel Royal on account of
the manner In which he sang a difficult
aria from Haydn and at fourteen he won
the Mendelssohn scholarship in compe
tition with eixteen other candidates, all
older than himself. For two years he
studied in London with Sterndale Ben
nett and Goss; for three more at Lelpsic
Â¦with Moschelles. Hauptmann. Rletz and
Plaldy. "I am obliged to work tremend
ously hard here," ne wrote. "No sooner
Is one master dispatched than I rush home
Mr. R. H. Russell sends me a charming
little edition of the "Bab Ballads," with
the daintiest reproductions of the author's
quizzical Illustrations. Many of the old
favorites are here, Including "The Yarn
of the Nancy Bell" and the Immortal
"Bishop of Rum-TI-Foo," but many also
are missing. There is a 10-cent edition
put out by a cheap publisher In New
York, which contains twenty-two ballads
not in Mr. Russell's edition. Why these
were omitted It is difficult to imagine, for
some of them represent Gilbert at his
best Such are "The Reverend ' Simon
Magus," that scathing satire on simony;
"The Haughty Actor," a ballad which
every successful hlstrio should commit to
memory; "The Fairy Curate," which con
tains In embryo the opera of "Iolanthe";
last but not least, "The "Way of "Wooing,"
that most humoristlco-romantic of varia
tions upon the theme "Faint heart ne'er
won fair lady. â¢ â¢ â¢ Your reader, my
dear Mr. Russell, has evidently entered
lightly. upon the delicate undertaking of
selecting his Gilbert without knowing his
subject thoroughly. To omit such gems
from your collection Is like showing us
the crown Jewels in the tower when the
Koh-1-noor is away on exhibition some
where else.
Borne day a better life of Sullivan Â¦will
be written, but that cannot be while Mr.
Gilbert lives. In the meantime this book
will stand a not unworthy monument to
the only English composer worthy to rank
beside the great Purcell.
Sir Arthur Sullivan's other successes are
too recent to need recapitulation. All that
It Is worth while here to do Is to call at
tention to interesting material in Mr.
Lawrence's book other than that already
touched upon. Among this will be found
the American Reminiscences of chapter
VII; Sullivan's Personality and Method
of "Work, chapter XII: the lecture on mu
sic delivered by Sullivan at Birmingham
In 1888, the complete list of his writings
compiled by Wilfred Bendall, and the Es
says in Rhythm, page 224.
His Immense success as an operatic
composer was due to nomere chance, but
was based upon prolonged study of stage
effects while a member of the orchestra
at Covent Garden. His first dramatic
composition was the music to "Cox and
Box" (Burnand's libretto), produced at
the Adelphia Theater In 1866. Five years
later he met Gilbert and in 1872 they wrote
their first opera, "Thespis"â forgotten
now save for one charming song, "The
Little Maid of Arcadee." "Trial by
Jury" followed In 1S75, "The Sorcerer" in
1S77 (why Is this never given now?), and
with "Pin2fore," in 1S78, came world
wide reputation. Curiously enough this
piece did so r oorly for the first few weeks
that it was about to be withdrawn when
an arrangement of Its principal airs for
military band caught the ear of the pub
lic and sent them in shoals to the Opera
Comique. The opera ran for two years
in London; in the United States it was
played at one time by forty-two different
companies and one hundred thousand bar
rel organs were constructed to perform it
and nothing else. Such are the penalties
of popularity.
to prepare for another." But the hard
work told. At eighteen he was composing
his music to "The Tempest," which was
performed at Leipsic with great success
when he was nineteen and was repeated
with still greater success In London the
next year (1S62). "Sullivan was now a
made man; at twenty he had established
a reputation greater than that ever be
fore established by any English composer
of his years. That his worth as a man
was not less than his worth as a com
poser is shown by the fact that his friend
ship was sought and valued by such men

three of Stainer's best anthems: "Awake!
Awake!" "Lead, Kindly Light," and "O
Clap Your Hands"; also solos and chor
uses from his cantatas, "The Daughter
of Jalrus," "St. Mary Magdalen" and
"The Crucifixion."

charity concert, and revert3 rather bit
terly to her Oakland experiences in con
nection with the same. She contrasts her
recent audiences at St. James Hall in
London, when she gave for the first time
her own song cycle, with the $S3 house
she drew at the Oakland Coliseum on the
only occasion when she invited an Oak
land audience to recognize substantially
her long service in the cause of charity
in her native town. She never appeared
again after that experience without be
ing paid, and well, for her work. As be
fore said, the charity concert la a prolific
subject, and a dangerous one In these
days of thrifty women's clubs, but It has
the attraction of its danger, and ere long
some courageous Don Quixote will bÂ»
tilting at the windmills, and great will
be the confusion thereat.
Town Talk of last week contains the
sprightly autobiography of a Californian
girl, who is one of the many that have
won success in a chosen line in other
than her own State and country â Carrie
Northey Douglas, formerly of East Oak
land, and now of the Turner Grand Opera
Company in England. The sketch Is well
worth reading from many standpoints.
The simcer has achieved the enviable po
sition that is hers by sheer hard work,
and modestly disclaims any but the
genius of industry in accounting for her
success. Mrs. ,. Douelas â¢ ends her letter
with the following suggestive credo:
"This brings me down to date, and In
looking forward to my future contracts,
that will keep me busy for some years to
come on this side of the wide, wide ocean,
1 can justly say that I have earned
through hard work all the success and
happiness I am now enjoying. No one has
helped me; there has been.no man's blank
checkbook for me to fill in at my pleas
ure to buy my way to success, neither a
woman's perfumed note to open -the por
tal for me. It has been WORK. WORK,
WORK! filling each hour of my day and
my dreams at night, leaving no room for
the careless, idle moment, from which
are born temptations ending In shame and
degradation. Yes, work has made me
what I am. My voice has been my one
true friend, in shadow as In sunlight, in
success and in failure, that has never de
serted me. In grateful return I treat it
as such, guarding It as the richest jewel
I possess, and living: that life that may
never cause it to be ashamed of me. Its
mistress."
. In her letter Mrs. Douglas touches
After the long silence of the Saturday
Morning Orchestra their good work at the
concert on Thursday evening last at Sher
man-Clay Hall came somewhat as a sur
prise. The club has been working stead
ily during the winter months under the
competent leadership of Oscar Weil and
their faithful effort took effective shape
in the modest, well chosen and well ren
dered programme of Thursday evening.
Mr. Weil's name is naturally enough
found anywhere else but on a programme
given under his direction, but It is well
recognized that it is to his peculiar in
spiration the young ladles of the orches
tra owe the satisfactory level of accom
plishment of which their concert gives
evidence.
The first orchestral number was not al
together promisingâ an arrangement of
the Beethoven "Pathetique" adaglÂ©. The
rendering leaned to the ultra-sentimental,
snowing itself in lagging tempore and an
indisposition to obey the baton. The
shading and balance of the parts were,
however, very satisfactory. With the
second number, a "Marcia, Glocosa" of
Hiller, given with much spirit and
rhythmic swing, the orchestra had pulled
itself together, and by their third num
bers, a Bach Sarabande and the B minor
prelude and fugue, amply evidenced the
progress that has been made during Mr.
Weil's directorship. The Bach numbers
were by much ths best offering? of the
orchestra and" were played with evident
enjoyment of their quaint and dignified,
movement. Some of the Schubert
"I^aendler" ended the programme, and
though not up to the Bach level were yet
played in suificiently worthy fashion.
* â¢ â¢
The club was assisted by Miss Alice B.
Toklas, a clever pupil of Otto Bendlx. She
gave a broad and dignified reading of the
Schubert "Der Wanderer."
The young pianist has the sure, clean
touch of all Mr. Bendlx's pupils and pos
sesses besides marked temperament. The
orchestral accompaniment to Miss Toklas'
number was indifferently good in places,
owing 1 , perhaps, to a " lack of rhythmic
authority on the pianist's part, at least
in Miss Freeman's violin number, the
Viotti twenty-first* 1 concerto (first move
ment), it was so conspicuously better aa
to suggest the criticism. Miss Grace
Freeman, another good student. Is a
Minetti pupil, and gave a very intelligent
and musicianly rendering of the Viotti
movement. The concert, on the whole,
was a decided success, and the next affair
of the kind Is awaited with pleasure.
SIEGFRIED WAGNER, son of the
great master of the German music
drama, has committed a second
opera, "Herzog Wildfang," that
was produced for the first time on
March 23 at the Court Theater in Munich.
According to the lively account of a
Leipsic correspondent in the Musical
Courier, this second effort of the son of
Richard "Wagner and grandson of Llzst
Is an even more pronounced failure than
was his first attempt at operatic compo
sition, the "Barenhaeuter." Those critics
who had before reserved their judgment
for a final decision now emphatically
deny the possession of any talent for this
or other form of musical composition to
Siegfried Wagner. It is freely alleged
that "Herzog Wildfang" is but a feeble
imitation of "Der Meistersinger," which
it closely resembles in plot. The text,
also -written by the composer, is graph
ically described as "tommyrot."
Frau Cosima Wagner managed the pro
duction, which was given under the di
rection of Ernst von Possart, who saw to
it that every possible chance of success,
in the excellent cast and splendid staging,
was afforded the new opera. But all to
no purpose. The opera was greeted with
hisses and catcalls all through the per
formance quite powerful enough to drown
the cheers of the Wagner party, but not
sufficient to deter the younjr Siegfried
from appearing time after time before
the curtain to respond to the demands
of his friends. Poor Siegfried ! he has evi
dently the usual fate of the son of the
great man before him. The performance
ended in a perfect pandemonium and
young Wagner left the place a full
fledged martyr to the Wicked Critics,
who are always found in wait for the
New Genius.

A grand jury sits In secret. It has authority to indict A'hom it chooses and upon what evi
dence it chooses. The accused has no right to demand a hearing, no right to confront his ac
cusers, no privilege to examine . those who testify against him. The ease with which such powers
can be used for partisan or malicious purposes has long been known; and it has repeatedly hap
pened in all parts of the country that grand juries have used their powers for the basest pur
poses. Rarely have they accomplished any good. Many times have they done much evil
and wrong. Sometimes they make reports, "whitewashing" incompetent or bad officials, and
sometimes they make reports casting suspicion upon innocent persons solely to gratify partisan
hostility or personal malice, ,
Why should any American citizen be subject to that kind of outrage? The question is per
tinent to more issues than the one now before the public. The Mayor, the Chief of Police and the
District Attorney.have been this time the victims of outrage,. but who can say where malice will
act next? The secret, sly, star chamber system of the Grand Jury is unworthy of American civil
izatioru It is a relic of bygone barbarism and should be abolished.
The American people have long noted the frequency of outrages committed by grand juries
in their reports, and again and again a call has been made for an; abolition of the system. The re
port of this Grand Jury will revive the question in San Francisco, because it exhibits in a striking
manner the terrible power placed in the hands of grand jurors and the injustice with which that
power is often used.
The Call is not now, nor has it ever been, an apologist for Mayor Phelan or for Chief Sul
livan. It has had many occasions to criticize the Mayor, and has done so without fear or favor.
No paper in the city or in the State has more severely condemned his shortcomings as an official,
or has more repeatedly pointed out to the people the frequency with which he has violated
his campaign pledges and the spirit of the charter of which he professes to be the foremost cham
pion. Recognizing, then, the full extent of the defects of the administration, The Call nevertheless
maintains that he and the Chief of Police and every other official is entitled to fair play and should
not be subjected to the style of attack that has been made in this instance.
Â¦ ' ? Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ â¢
OF the report made by the Grand Jury concerning the Police Department fair-minded
and intelligent men will have but one opinion. From first to last the report shows evi
dence of partisan bias, of personal prejudice and something of malice. It is in fact in the
nature of an outrage against which it is the duty of good citizens to protest.
A GRAND JURY OUTRAGE.
THE public school teachers, and the friends of the public schools in this city, may well feel
uneasy at the prospect of subjecting the teachers to a most offensive, and, in the end, dan
gerous, partisan control.
There has been more intrigue in the present School Board and more fantastic injustice
toward the teachers than ever before in the history of our schools, the unfragrant time of the
"Tough Old Board" not excepted.. What the world called a "compact" between the Mayor and
the Examiner, but what has been characterized by the Mayor and sworn to as "an understand
ing," was a pledge in advance to give a partisan newspaper a finger in the school pie. Other "ap
pointments to the board seem to have recognized in the social clubs a right to representation in
'management of the schools, and the net result is a control that has founded the school system
upon intrigue, and given it over to interests that have no stake in the high purposes of common
school education except to use the power of its organization for the promotion of ambitions that
ought not to use teachers and janitors as horses to be ridden to. the wire- 1 â indifferent to their fate
thereafter.
The new regulation for the maintenance of an eligible list and its us'e.as a means to clear
out the whole teaching force at will is justly offensive to the teachers and injurious to the schools.
Under the new rule fifteen per cent of these eligibles are to be chosen from' educational insti
tutions that have a course in pedagogy, thirty-five per cent are to be selected at will from other
cities after having, shown unusual ability in teaching. The other fifty per cent of eligibles are to
be processed into place by mutual agreement of the members of the board. In selecting from this
list to be permanently appointed, numerical and chronological order will not be observed. By the
consolidation of classes it is possible to obsolete any teacher now in the department, who may go
upon the eligible list/provided it is not already full, but may remain there forever, with no guar
antee of re-employment unless possessed of a sufficient "pull" to get back.
This list is the only door that opens into the department. The graduates of the San Fran
cisco Normal School and the State Normal School must compete with Stanford and Berkeley
and fight for a place in the,, fifteen per cent of the list which is assigned to institutions where ped
agogy is taught, while more than twice as many places are subject to be filled by persons from
New York, Chicago, Boston â anywhere, when in the judgment of members of the board they
have shown unusual ability in teaching! This is the opportunity sought to' quarter on our tax
payers, relatives, friends or favorites of the board, from the East or anywhere outside of San Fran
cisco, while the graduates of our city normal school must take, their diplomas in hand and go beg
ging for the chance to earn bread among strangers. It discredits! that normal school, and dilutes
the value of its diploma, as its recognition is so limited" at home it will get less abroad.
Combined with the power to consolidate classes at will, and throw out teachers now in the
department, this plan for eligibles puts every teacher absolutely at the mercy of the board, and
effects just that disturbance which is the most inimical to good work in the schools. There is no
profession which requires the repose of certainty more than that of the teacher. Standing in loco
parentis, teachers have much of the responsibility and many of the cares of parents transferred to
them, without the sustaining influence of that affection which the child feels for the parent. The
manners, morals, cleanliness end physical safety of thousands of 'children of all .ages are handed
over by parents to teachers for one-third of the time every school day, from the time children are
five years old until they pass out of the public schools twelve years later. In that/period the teach
ers must not only administer the duty and functions of the parents, but they must train a gener
ation for citizenship, for the purposes of the state, and upon that training depends the vast future
of the government itself.
What other class carries such a burden? What other has such responsibilities? What other
deserves equal security of tenure and freedom from the afflictions of intrigue and the offensive
domineering of partisanship and personal self-seeking of' those who are in legal control of their
fate? . . . ''â¢-;*>';
In every respect in which the teachers should 1 be safe in their merit and experience, safe in
their tenure, safe in just and considerate treatment, this new plan strips them of all protection,
and by so doing injures the efficiency of their service.
We are well aware that the board is able to fall back on names'of great authority to jusiify
a system which it has sought for its own use and advantage; but neither the presidents of the
universities, nor their professors of pedagogy, nor the principal of the San Francisco Normal
School, nor the State Superintendent, can give reasons for the plan which overweigh those against
it. It is unjust to teachers, inimical to their best work, unfair to the graduates of our normal school
and treats contemptuously the right of our people to these preferments, merit being equal.
It leaves the board without a check or limit, bit or rein, beyond its own will, and that unguided
by knowledge or experience of practical teaching, unchastened by any sympathy with teachers, and
unrefined by any exalted appreciation of their high calling as the trustees of parents and
the patient sentinels of the safety of the state.

CUBANS APPEAL
FOR ASSISTANCE
President Confers 'With
the Island Delega
tion.
All Now Depends on Early
Formation of a Gov
ernment.
WASHINGTON. April 27.â The Cuban
delegation completed its labor In Wash
ington to-day. In the morning the dele
gates met Secretary Root,, who escorted
them to the White House, where they
had a final and decisive talk with the
President. Then they paid visits of cour
tesy to each of the officials whom they
have met, and finally they started for
New York at 11 o'clock to-night, home
ward bound. They will sail for Havana
Wednesday.
The proceedings at the> White House
were interesting and Important. Senor
Capote acted as spokesman for the dele
gation. He thanked the President for the
many courtesies shown them, which they
accepted as expressions of good will to
the Cuban people. He invited the Presi
dent to visit Cuba to see for himself the
conditions ln the Islands and learn from
contact with the inhabitants of the love
and affection which the Cubans have for
the United States and their appreciation
of what it has done for them in their
struggle for freedom.
Senor Capote asked the President to do
something for the Cubans upon an eco
nomic line, and especially ln the matter
of reciprocal trade relations. He said
that it was especially desirable to have
something of this kind done before the
next crop was harvested, in order that
the Cubans might see the advantages to
them of close political and economic re
lations with the United States.
In reply the President said it was im
possible to settle the economic, questions
until the political questions were disposed
of. He told the delegates first to form
their government and then they would be
in a position to enter into negotiations
with the United States as to trade rela
tions.
Senor Capote responded that something
ought to be done while the Cuban Gov
ernment was forming. He thought that
while the United States was exercising
control there might be arrangements per
fected similar to those under- contempla
tion by the Secretary of War in 1S98.
when the Government first passed under
control of the United States. He told the
President that the Cuban republic did
not wish to be born in poverty and rags,
and if It could not be wealthy it would at
least prefer to have something with which
to support Itself and to have Its people
in a prosperous condition.
Government Must Be First.
The President agrain reverted to the fact
that under the present conditions, as the
Secretary of War had advised them, hs
did not see how It was possible to settle
any economic questions before the Cuban
government was formed. He would ap
point commissioners immediately after a
government was organized to negotiate
with similar commissioners from the Cu
ban government for reciprocal trade rela
tions, and he believed that the United
States would be ready to deal in a man
ner which would be beneficial to both
countries. He thanked the delegation for
the Invitation to visit the islands and told
them to assure the Cuban people of his
friendly interest ln them and his desire
to see them contented and prosperous.
Senor Capote, speaking to Secretary
Root, expressed the hope that in the In
terviews that haa been held he had said
nothing in his earnestness in argument
which was In any way offensive. The
Secretary replied that, on the contrary,
he highly appreciated the arguments of
Senor Canote and his knowledge of the
questions had Increased his admiration
and resnect for the legal abilities and
keenness of the Cuban people. The dele
gates then shook hands with the Presi
dent and departed. General Capote later
said:
Views of the Dslegates.
"We have concluded our business here.
We have had two Interviews with the
President and four with the Secretary of
War, during which all the matters we
came to discuss had the fullest and most
minute consideration. We came to con
sider the relations between Cuba and the
United States and these, both political
and economical, have had the most care
ful attention. We return to Cuba and
will refer to the constitutional convention
all the information we have obtained â in
formation which is highly important and
interesting." â¢
General Capote spoke in high terms of
Secretary Root. He said that the ques
tions were of national Importance, and
that the conferences were conducted with
the care that the serious matters under
consideration demanded.
General Wood also left to-night for
Florida, whence he will sail on a Gov
ernment vessel for Cuba. Mrs. Wood,
rho came on with the Governor General
to visit her Bister, who was formerly Miss
Condlt-Smith, and whom she had not
seen since the latter* s experience at
Peking during the siege there, returned
with her husband. '
General Wood had an hour's talk with
the President to-day before his departure.
He did not care to speak for publication
of his opinion of the result of the visit
of the Cuban Commission. There has
been a mutual understanding between the
parties to the conferences that have been
h.ld that no specific statement as to re
sults should be given out on either side
in advance of the commission's report to
the constitutional convention. There are
many political jealousies among the Cu
bans at home, and General Wood said
anything made public at this time might
be liable to misconstruction and lead to
friction. General Wood, however, does
not hesitate to state that the Cubans
have been impressed with the treatment
they have received and the attentions
shown them, and to say that undoubtedly
they return with a more correct under
standing of the meaning of the terms of
the Platt amendment and of the sincere
desire of the American Government to
put Guba on her feet as an independent
Government than they had before.
Has Not Leased Eugene Opera-house.
S. H. Friedlander, formerly of the Cali
fornia Theater, and now in Portland, Or.,
writes to correct a statement that has
gone the rounds to the effect that he has
leased the opera-house In Eugrene, Or.
Mr. Friedlander has not leased that or
any other opera-house, nor transacted
any managerial business since he was in
jured in Denver in December last. The
manager is, however, well on the way to
complete"recovery, and is expected to ar
rive in San Francisco durlner the coming:
week. Several flattering: offers to enter
ag-aln the amusement field in San Fran
cisco have been made to Mr. Friedlander,
but he has as yet nothing definite to say
on the fjuestion.
In many respects the trial concluded has
been remarkable, especially for the prom
inence of the witnesses and the Important
Â¦positions they occupy in the community.
Philbrook prosecuted his own case and
Judge Paterson was represented by E.
S. Pillsbury, W. S. Wood and William B.
Basley. Â¦
Judgment has been, entered agralnst
Horace W. Philbrook in his slander suit
against ex-Supreme Court Justice Van R.
Paterson. A unanimous verdict ln favor
of Judge Paterson and against the claim
ant was found by the jury sitting ln Judge
Murasky's court yesterday afternoon.
Philbrook claimed that he had been dam
aged in the sum of $100,000 through the ut
terance by Judge Paterson on July 11,
1900. of the statement that Philbrook was
crazy on the subject of fraud and cor
ruption; that he had seen Philbrook en a
boat after an interview in which he was
abusing certain people, gazing into the
heavens and talking like a crazy man.
Judge Paterson admitted that he uttered
the words stated, but denied that such ut
terance was slanderous or that the plain
tiff, through their utterance, had suffered
damage ln the sum named or in anv sum
at all. The jury has sustained his con
tention. . .
Those who served on the Jury are the
following named:
Robert C. Mayes. John Kllngel, Thomas
Corbett. George" W. Rickey. Anslem Ellas,
Adolph Schenkberg. H. fiichorn, Lansing
M. Rlngwalt, Walter S. Brown, Thomas
Gallagher, Bernard Sherry and Edward
Deady. ?
Just before noon yesterday Philbrook
concluded his closing argument with an
expression of regret that the time allowed
him by the court had expired and that
hence he was restrained from elucidating
matters which he had in mind. Judge
Murasky then charged the jury. He dwelt
at length upon the law of slander and Im
pressed the jury with the fact that the al
leged slanderous statement by Judge Pat
erson, having been made in his private of
fice to Judge Nusbaumer, was privileged
and that the plaintiff could not recover
unless It had been shown by the evidence
that the utterance complained of had been
actuated by malice. Judge Murasky also
instructed the jury that as Philbrook s
effort to connect Judge Paterson with an
alleged conspiracy to ruin him, members
of the Supreme and Superior benches be
ing alleged parties to the conspiracy, had
failed, they must dismiss such charges
from their mind and cast them aside in
their deliberation. Philbrook entered an
exception to some instructions given and
another exception to the action of the
court in refusing to give other instruc
tions asked by him.
The jury, in charge of the Deputy Sher
iff, was taken to lunch and a few minutes
after returning announced that a verdict
had been reached. The jury was taken
into court and the decree recorded. JPhil
brook and his wife, who was ln court,
manifested no surprise at the verdict,
though during the trial their every action
evidenced their belief that a judgment
would be found and entered ln their favor.
Instructions of Court Elimin
ate the Charge of
Conspiracy.
Jury Decrees That Phil
brook Was Not
Slandered.

Of the Pyramid Pile Cure
Ts tho fact that It cures every form of
Piles without one particle of pain. This de-
sirable point is not obtained by the use of
Injurious opiates which simply deaden and
paralyze the nerves of the parts and make
matters worse in the long run. But it is
done solely by its remarkably heallngr and
soothing effects. And while it thus gives
immediate relief, at the same time the
disease is not merely checked, but a radi-
cal cure is rapidly accomplished. And the
point we want to make clear is that all
this Is done without a particle of pain.:
The Pyramid Pile Cure has been before
the public too long and its merits recog-
nized by too many, people to allow it to
be classed with the many salves, supposi-
tories, pills, etc., and you run no risk in
trying it. as is often the case with new
and untried preparations. If you are ever
troubled with any form of piles or rectal
disease do not forget the Pyramid Pile
Cure. Prepared by Pyramid Drug Co.,
Marshall, Mich., and sold by all druggists
at 50 cents per package.

DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.
The New Discovery for Catarrh Seems
to Possess Remarkable
Merit.
A new catarrh cure has recently ap-
peared which so far" as tested has been
remarkably successful in curing all forms
of catarrh, whether In the head, throat,
bronchial tubes, or In stomach ajid liver.
The remedy is in tablet form, pleasant
and convenient to take and no special
secrecy is maintained as to what it con-
tains, the tablet being a scientific combi-
nation of Guaiacol, Eucalyptol, Sangulna-
ria Hydrastin and similar valuable and
harmless antiseptics. ,
This safe and effective catarrh cure may
be found at any drug store under name
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
Whether the catarrh is located In tho
nose throat, bronchial tubes or stomach,
the tablets seem to act with equal suc-
cess removing the stuffy feeling in head
and nose, clearing the mucous membrane
of throat and trachae from catarrhal se-
cretions, which cause the tickling, cough-
ine hawking and gagging so annoying to
every catarrh sufferer.
Nasal catarrh generally leads to ulcera-
tion in some cases to such an extent as
to destroy the nose entirely and in many
old cases of catarrh the bones of the head
become diseased. Nasal catarrh gradually
extends to the throat and bronchial tubes
and very often to the stomach, causing
that very obstinate ; trouble, catarrh of
the stomach. "
Catarrh is a systemic poison. Inherent in
the blood, and local washes, douches,
salves, inhalers and sprays can have no
effect on the real cause of the disease.
An internal remedy which acts upon the
blood is the only rational treatment, and
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets Is the safest of
all internal remedies, as well as the most
convenient and satisfactory from a mefll-
cal standpoint.
Dr. Eaton recently stated that he had
successfully used Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets in old chronic cases, even where ul-
ceratfon had extended so far as to destroy
the septum of the nose. He says: "I am
Sleasantly surprised almost every day
y the excellent results from" Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets. It is remarkable how
effectually they remove the excessive se-
cretion and bring about a healthy condi-
tion of the mucous membranes of- tho
nose, throat and stomach."
All druggists sell complete treatment of
the tablets at 50 cents, and a little book
giving the symptoms and causes of the
various forms of catarrh Â¦will be- mailed
free by addressing F. A. Stuart Co., Mar-
shall. Mich.

The members of the California Petrole
um Miners' Association are sat'sfled that
the decision of Secretary of the Interior
Hitchcock will settle the controversy that
has raged between the mineral locators
and the scrippers for a long period. Pres
ident Crane of the Association calls at
tention to the fact that the fight has been
carried on with much vigor by the body of
which he is the head. It was through
the representations of the Petroleum Min
ers' Association, he says, that Land Com
missioner Binger Hermann was induced
to come to California to look the ground
over for himself. While here he collected
photographs of the lands that were in
controversy and these figured in reach-
Ing an understanding of the real facts at
Washington. When the issue was at its
most acute stage, the California Miners'
Association and the Petroleum Miners'
Association acted together, as will be re
called, and the California Miners' Associ
ation adopted strong resolutions concern-
Ing the scrippers and their clalmB. Now
that the decisions have been rendered
many companies that have been waiting
will go ahead again, having an idea that
their land titles will not be disturbed.
Wells In Humboldt
David E. Gordon furnishes an account
of the petroleum prospecting in Humboldt
County. He writes that as a matter of
fact, oil development has only Just begun
In Humboldt. As far back as 1S65 an ef
fort was made in that direction and the
evidences of the work then performed are
still evident at Petrolia and in the Bear
River section. A few years ago a well was
drilled more than 1200 feet in the vicinity
of Briceland, about 85 miles from Eureka.
For some reason the well was capped but
the town of Briceland is being lighted
with natural gas from the pioneer well,
and the gas is also used for heating and
cooking purposes. Some of the owners are
Inclined to resume work at the Briceland
well, believing that oil will reward them.
A number of wells were begun in Mattole
Valley proper last year and some gratify
ing results were obtained. Particularly
was this the case in McNutt Gulch. E. M.
Hoagland of Oakland is in charge of drill
ing operations on the Etter place in the
upper Mattole Valley. At Joels Flat, on
the Jesse Walker possessions, five miles.
north from Petrolia, a well is being drilled
under th*Â» direction of Sidney Stone. One
well was filled with water, last year, and
abandoned. Another well will be drilled
Dear the first welL Mr. Smith Is preparing
to drill two wells, one at Table Bluff and
the other In Mattole Valley. The Arcata
Oil Company Is developing lands in the vi
cinity of Arcata In the search for oil, at
Dows Prairie and In other localities.
There are reports of oil indications In oth
er sections of Humboldt County, but Mr.
Gordon says that definite Information
concerning them Is lacking.
The oil producers of the northwest ex
tension of the Los Angeles field have
troubles in the shape of limited facilities
for the caring of their product according
to the Los Angeles Times. Lack of cheap
transportation has forced producers to
dispose of their surplus at what It would
bring. The product of the field Is about
10,000 barrels per month, the oil being 15
to 16 gravity. As the transportation rates
are 15 cents per barrel the oil can be deliv
ered in Los Angeles at 75 cents. There Is
no standard price and the producers are
at sea.
Association Plans.
It is supposed that the will of the oil
producers 'will soon be known concerning
the plan that has been prepared by the
committee representing the producing
companies within a short time. The com
ments on the plan, which was published
exclusively In The Call, are generally fa
vorablo In this city where many of the
Mineral Locators of Oil
Are Satisfied With
Decision.
SCRIPPERS ARE
WHOLLY ROUTED

leading companies have representatives.
The lack of system that has resulted in
having every company fighting to get a
market, independently, with the inevita
ble fall in price, has been a lesson to the
producers that will help to get them to
gether, if the predictions heard at this end
of the line are correct.
The Truckee Republican says that an
oil excitement is probable on account of
the discovery at Verdi, Nev., of what are
taken for indications of oil. "In fact, an
excitement is now in its inciplency, and
poor ranchers, who have been struggling
along for years, making perhaps little
more than a bare existence, are placing
fabulous prices on their sagebrush and
rock piles."
A. L. Darrow has made a proposition to
the Chamber of Commerce of Stockton
to place a well-drilling outfit on the
ground within twenty miles of Stockton
before May 31 and drill for oil if the peo
ple of Stockton will subscribe for 20,000
shares of stock at 50 cents per share, the
subscription to be guaranteed before May
15. The secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce has Invited Darrow to person
ally present his proposition at Stockton.
Notss of Industry.
The system of extracting by compressed
air was not a success in the McKittrick
district, according' to the Bakersfield Cal
ifornian. The reason assigned is that the
ojl is of higher gravity than that in the
Kern River district, where the experi
ment succeeded.
The Peerless Company, in the Kern
River district, recently turned off a con
signment of fourteen carloads of oil,
which is said to have been the largest
quantity yet shipped by a single company.
The Bakersfleld Callfornian says that
Special Land Agent Ryan will recommend
that the Land Department cancel home
stead entries on oil lands in the Kern
River district that were filed at the time
the scrippers were causing so much con
sternation.
Work has begun on an oil well on the
Huffman-Crocker land near Merced. The
derrick Is about completed and the ma
chinery Is ready to put in place.
The Mining and Engineering Review
ascertains that since petroleum was first
struck In the Lucas well at Beaumont,
January 10, ninety-six oil companies have
been chartered in Texas and four In other
States for the purpose of developing the
Texas oil fields, a great majority of them
Intending to operate in Beaumont. These
100 companies have an aggregate capital
of J28.537.000. The smallest capital is $5000
and the largest $5,000,000. There are six
companies with a capitalization of $1,000,
000 each and fifteen of $500,000 or greater,
not Including the ones specified.
Using Compressed Air.
The Eakorsfleld Califorolan gives an ac
count of the trial of pumping oil by means
of compressed air that "was made by the
Euclid Company in the Kern River dis
trict. It was a success. The Californlan
says: â¢
A short tlmÂ» a*o the Euclid, on 30, 28, 28,
decided to try the experiment, which Is re
ported to have turned out as successful as
could have been wished. , Instead of being
troubled wltlj the wearing out of machinery
and consequent delays the company has been
able to remove all the oil from its wells, to
gether with whatever sand was carried, and
pebble* as large as almonds have floated to
the surface, assuring: a free hole In. the future
and giving promise that the vexatious stop
pages of the past will not be experienced *cain.
In twelve houn the air forces out all the oil
and the well is i allowed to rest for the same
length of time, after which pumping Is re
sumed. In this way a small compressor la
able to do the work for two wells.
The method adopted for the. application of
tbo air is to run tubintr to the bottom of the
bole, the end of the tubing: being left' open.
A foot or so above ths lower end a pipe which
leads down from the compressor ts connected
with the tubing: and the air Is released at thlfe
point. In Its struggle to rise to the surface
the air takes with it all the oil that Is in
the pipe and the removal of the oil causing
a vacuum to be formed the oil rushes Into the
tubing and is thus made to flow in a steady
stream.
The progress of drilling: In Shasta Coun
ty Is summarized as follows: The Bella
"Vista is down 800 feet; the Mount Shasta
drill is not operating because of the
breaking of machinery; the Shasta well
Is down 300 feet; the Keswick has ordered
a. standard rig and will drill two miles
north from Redding 1 . -

CALIFORNIA NORTHWESTERN
RAILWAY.
Summer Schedule.
Effective April 28, the California North
Â¦western Railway's summer schedule goes
into effect.
This means that on week days the
morning train leaving San Francisco at
7:30 o'clock and afternoon train at 3:30
o'clock will both run through to Ukiah,
and there will be two trains daily from
Ukiah to San Francisco, thus giving the
main line double daily service.
In addition there will be double daily
service on Sundays. As usual, the train
leaving at 8:00 a. m. will run through to
Ukiah, but the train leaving here 5:00
p. m. on Sundays, which in tne past has
run only as\tar as Santa Rosa, will con
tinue on to tSkiah. As in the past, there
will be an afternoon train from Ukiah to
San Francisco on Sundays, leaving at 2:15,
but in addition to that there will be a
morning train from Ukiah to San Fran
cisco, leaving at 5:50, thus giving for the
first time to all points double daily serv
ice on Sundays. ' I
On this day, April 2S, the double dally
service will begin between San Francisco,
Glen Ellen, Sonoma, Vineyard and all
Sonoma branch points. The freight trains
on the Sonoma branch will be run en
tirely separate from the passenger, thus
doing away with the mixed freight and
passenger service which governed in the
winter.
WASHINGTON, April 27.â A complete
rapprochement between the governments
of Austria and Mexico has been brought
about end as a result each country is
about to send a Minister to the other.
This terminates an international
estrangement dating back to the days
when- young Maximilian of Austria
Boupht to gain a fcothold in Mexico and
lost his life In the adventure. A bill has
passed the Mexican Congress providing
for a Minister to Austria at a salary of
$11,000 annually. Austria will take similar
action by sending a Minister to Mexico,
and this will close the long and historic
separation.
â¢ihe Mexican Government has taken
steps to resume diplomatic communication,
Â¦with South American countries, the first
move in that direction being the appoint
ment of a Mexican Minister to the Ar
gentine Republic. For many years there
has been no diplomatic intercouse be
tween Mexico and her sister republics on
the southern continent, as there was little
commerce between them and few political
questions requiring diplomatic represent
ations.
Recently, however, Argentina made a
friendly move by accrediting a Minister
to both Washington and Mexico City, and
Uruguay has talcen similar action. The
selection of Mexico City as the place for
holding the Congress of American Repub
lics has been a further influence in induc
ing Mexico to extend her relations with
South and Central America.

Large amounts of money have been in
volved in certain mining deals on the
coast of late. Two and one-auarter mil
lions of dollars made up the purchase
.price .of the holdings of Captain de la
Mar at Bully Hill. Shasta County, and
the transfer of properties from De la Mar
to the Bully Hill Copper and Smelting
Company include nineteen claims and op
tions on several others. The Northern
Light, Grizzly and Fairview claims in
Bir.gham, Utah, brought $50,000 from an
"Eastern purchaser. New York capitalists
havo paid $30,000 for a group . of copper
and gold bearing claims at Cave "Valley,
Nevada, Also, according to the Deseret
Evening Press, a group of mines at Bing
ham, Utah, has been bonded, the price
being $1,000,000. Captain de la- Mar has
just concluded negotiations for a group
of mines adjoining the Bully Hill on the
west.
Isaac. Jones, agent in charge of the
United States experiment station at Ram
part, Alaska, has written a letter to The
Call, of which the substance is as follows:
Considerable attention was given to the Tan
ana and Â¦ Its tributaries -by prospectors last
summer and In a few Instances small pros
pects were found, but nothing more than gO3d
wages. In the early summer exaggerated re
ports of finds on the Xanana reached the Yu
kon and a stampede was started which result
ed In a great deal of staking of claims.
Since that time there has been no development
and there has been no excitement of a:Â«y kind,
alons tn lower Yukon this winter except that
occasioned by reports from the coast. At each
of the camps along the Yukon, in United
States territory, there are a few claims that
pay more than Rood wage?, more that pay
small waROH., for the country, nn<l a still
greater number that so far have yielded but
a prospect, MÂ«ny of the creeks that were
thought to be rich and which wevo worked
for the flr?t time this winter have Kreatly

being taken out, on some of the old claims,
but there is absolutely no new find worthy

Humboldt County Copper.
The Eureka (Humboldt County) Stand
ard is Â¦ntlarled that a rich copper prop
erty haB been found In tho Mattole VallGy
and says that It promises to be the great
est oopper proposition in Northern Cali
fornia. . The following description Is from
the Standard:
The cropplngs of tho ledge can be traced for
nearly four miles along a spur of the Rain
bow ridge. Since the discovery prospect holes
sunk on the;ledgre have given Indications that Â¦
a rich body of copper lies underneath and that' I
the ledge grows richer with depth. The en
tire ledge, as far as the cropplnga indicate
its existence, has been staked off in regular
claims of 1500 lineal feet each, twelve In all,
located respectively by J. C. Hampton, vice'
president, and G. C. Douglass, superintendent .
of the Pacific Lumber Company; J. H., A. S.,
A. H. and M. H. Crismon, W. K. Meakln. G.
M. Spaulding, J. H. French, H. L. Ford, A.
E. Look and Daniel Shlvely.
The Mountain Messenger reports that a
quartz discovery has been made near Si- j
erra City in a ledge in the Golden Era 1
mine. The property is owned by Thomas i
Murphy. The mine is a little more than-!
a mile to the northeast of Sierra City, on i
the Yuba River. |
The Shaw mine in Calaveras County has !
started up, after' disuse extending over!
several years. It is a gravel proposition.
The Calaveras Citizen says that it is on

been found. Â¦Â¦ j
The new stamps of the : Yellow Aster
mill at Randsburg bring up the total to
be soon operated to 150. ,Â¦
Mining in" Siskiyou County is moving

Fortunately it is one of the most de-
licious bits of food used by mankind, the
delicate sweet of Grape-Sugar being of
the most charming- character. All promi-
nent grocers 6ell Grape-Nuts, made at
the pure food factories of the Postum
Cereal Co., Ltd., at Battle Creek, Mich. .
These unite in the human body, forming
the peculiar soft substance which fills the
cells of the brain. Therefore, when one
desires to use a food directly intended
for brain-building the food Grape-Nuts
may be depended upon.
The food specialist, however, has been
at work, and in Grape-Xuts we find a
food containing delicate natural particles
of Phosphate of Potash and larger quan-
tities of albumen.
Farmers select certain food to bring
about desired results in their animals,
but It is not so easy a matter with the
complex machine called man (or more
highly organized woman). :

Pure blood results from wholesome food
thoroughly digested. Impure blood results
from poor .'digestion und assimilation.
When the stomach refuses to work- prop-
erly the food remains too long a time,
fermenting, forming gases, shown by
sour, bitter, taste in the mouth, bloating
and belching of gas, and distress and dis-
comfort generally. Poor . blood, weak
nerves, sleeplessness and a general don't
care feeling can always be traced to im-
perfect digestion.
. This is the" reason why Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are superior to all other
spring medicines and blood purifiers.
They give perfect digestion; the food does
not lie in the stomach for hours. They
give a vigorous appetite, sound sleep,
strong nerves,' arid wholesome food well
digested makes pure blood, and in no
other wav can the blood be purified. .The
idea that a medicine, in itself, will purify
the blood when the stomach and diges-
tive organs are out of order is nonsense.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are used by
thousands in preference to "bitters,"
"after dinner 'pills' and "blood purifiers"
because they remove the cause of the im-
pure blood, and you do not have to take
them forever to get results. Dyspepsia
is an obstinate disease to cure and a
remedy must be designed especially for
it and nothing else.. Cure-alls will not
cure dyspepsia. â¢ Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are not
claimed to cure everything or anything
except Dyspepsia and stomach troubles,
and for that it 'stands alone among pat-
ent medicines. Any one suffering from
any trouble with their digestion will.Iind
these tablets will give immediate relief
and a permanent cure.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are Â£ pre-
pared by the F. A. Stuart Co. of Mar-
shall, Mich., and sold by druggists every-
where at. 50 cents per. package. No diet-
ing nor change of habits, is required; they
digest the food.
The spring of the year is the time for
blood purifiers. It is the season when we
think we must dose ourselves with sarsa-
parillas, bitters and the endless .list of so-
called blood purifiers and nerve tonics..
As a matter of fact, there is but one
possible way in which to purify the blood
and that is through the stomach - and
bowels. .

Alabaster Discovered.
C. B. Hanna, a cousin of Senator Han-
'First, whether a valid discovery of gold has
been made, ,such as -would warrant i a
prudent person in the further expen-
diture of his time and means with the
reasonable hope of developing In the future a
valuable mine, and second, -whether or not
prior to the expiration of the period of notice
of application for patent, February 8. U0Q.
there had been expended by the claimant or
his srantors $5C0 worth of labor or improve-
ments, made in good faith.. for the purpose and
with the intent of developing the claim as a.
mining/claim, and that the improvements â¢ so
made and credited to the claim in satisfaction
of those provisions of sections 23 and 2o,
Revised Statutes, are of a character suitable
for the. purpess intended. Â¦ . .
The Register and Receiver gave a de-
cision, answering in the affirmative both
of the questions submitted by the depart-
ment, and thus sustaining the mineral lo-
cation. .,â¢ r
The coming international mining con-
gress to be held at Boise, Idaho, will con-
tine from July 23 to July 25, inclusive.
The usual objects are set forth for the
congress, viz.â to secure better recogni-
tion of the mining industry by the Na-
tional Government; to bring about needed
changes in the Federal mining laws: -to
exchange practical ideas covering the va-
rious phases of the mining business, etc.
The basis of representation is as follows:
The Governor of each State and Territory to
name thirty delegates at large; the County
Commissioners of each county to name five
delegates at large; the Mayor of each city and
town to name five delegates at large and one
additional for each 10.000 population or frac-
tion thereof; each mining bureau, each mining
exchange, each real estate - exchange, each
chamber of commerce, each board of trade,
each miners' union and each trade and libor
assembly to name five delegates, and all other
commercial bodies to name five delegatea. The
call is slimed by L. Bradford Prince, presi-
dent, and Irwin Mahon. secretary. It urgrea
that delegates be appointed at once and that
the name and address of each besent to Sec-
retary Mahcn In. Boise.
An interesting decision has been ren-
dered by the Register and Receiver of the
local Land Office at Redding. A mineral
location was assailed on the ground that
the land covered by the entry was more
valuable for timber than for minerals.
The General Land Office ordered a hear-
ing on the following points: â¢
The Mining Congress;
The gravel deposits are. working along
the south fork, and at the Summerville
mine several thousand cubic yarda are
being moved off every day. Cooper's mine
at the head of the Salmon is in full opera-
tion. Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦.-Â¦:â¢ -Â¦Â¦Â¦
Plymouth district, Amador County, is
anticipating the expenditure of about
$600,000 by Alvinza Hayward and .the Ho-
bart estate in the near future in machin-
ery, ditches and dams. A large electrical
plant is also an expectation.
A contract has been made, so says the
Etna, Siskiyou County Advance, between
John- Quigley and H. F. Geney and East-
llck brothers of Oro Fino, by which the
latter parties, in company with John
Quigley, will commence operations on the
mining ground of Messrs. Quigley and
Geney, adjoining the Eastllck property at
Oro Fino. They will work this property
by the hydraulic and elevator process
with water from the Eastlick ditches, and
expect to have everything in running
order immediately. This ground is said
to be some of the richest placer diggings
in Oro Fino district, and no doubt the
new company will receive handsome re-
turns for their undertaking. They have
plenty of water to allow them to work
until the latter part of July.
na, reports that he has discovered a fine
deposit of alabaster on the desert in the
Carrlso Creek vicinity, and he has lo-
cated from 1200 to 1500 acres of mineral
land. He claims that experts have told
him that the alabaster is of high value.
He will place tho alabaster mine in shape
for developrnent, and will establish a per-
manent camp.

Accused of Soliciting Fees for a Sac-
ramento Lawyer to Land Chi
nese Immigrants.
United States Immigration Inspector
Hart JCorth is investigating charges made
against Chinese Inspector H. E. Tippett.
The charges were made to Commissioner
General Powderly by B. N. Bugby, Tax
Collector of Sacramento County. Mr.
Bugby says that Louis Chang, a China
man, had told him that Charles T.
Hughes, a Sacramento attorney, and Tip
pett had demanded of him ?75 each for
the landing of five Chinamen.
Tlppett denies all knowledge of the
transaction, hughes says that the
amount that he asked of Chong was at
torney's fees for tryine to land the men
In the usual legal way. Inspector Tiu
pett has not been suspended and has not
been served with a copy of the charges.
He has the reputation of being a zealous
and faithful officer and is not well spoken
of by attorneys engaged In landing Chi
nese, which is a recommendation in his
favor.

DISPUTE OVER
POINT OF LAW
Conlan and Seymour Dis
agree About Robbery
Charge.
Police Judge Conlan and Captain of De
tective Seymour have hurled defiance a
each other. It was"- expected that the dif
ficulty would be settled in fifteen minutes
but the two opponents have decided to de
clare a truce till to-morrow, when some
thing will drop, unless one or the othei
recedes from the position he has as
sumed.
The case of John Desmond and Johr
Hart, charged with robbery, has been ir
the Judge's court for the last three weeks
They were arrested three weeks ago to
day by Policemen Perclval and' McHugl
on the charge of robbing Edith Bashford
a little eirl whose parents then resided ai
177 Thirteenth street. They met her on
Thirteenth street near Howard and Des
mond was accused of forcibly taking from
her two silver bracelets and a gold ring.
They were seen by George McDonald, 214M
Castro street, -who gave the alarm and
Percival and McHugh caught them after
a chase of five blocks.
Yesterday morning the Judge, aftei
hearing the evidence, instructed the offl
cers to get McDonald to swear to a com
plaint for petty larceny, within flfteer
minutes, otherwise he would dismiss th<
cases.
The policemen reported the fact to Cap
tain Seymour, who instructed them to re
port back to the Judge that he would give
him fifteen minutes to alter his mind,
otherwise he would take the matter be
fore the Grand Jury, as he deemed the
actions of the prisoners constituted a
clear case of robbery.
The officers went back to the courtroom
and notified the Judge of the raptaln's
decision. Conlan was angry. "Well." he
said, "you tell Captain Seymour for me
that I advise him to keep as far away
from the Grand Jury as God Almighty
will allow him. I propose to run my court
in accordance with the laws of the State
without dictation from him. and If a com
plaint is not sworn to by Monday charg
ing the defendants with petty larceny
the cases will be dismissed and Captain
Seymour will be responsible for two
thieves escaping punishment." The cases
were accordingly continued till to-mor
row. The Judge said that the evidence
showed that there was neither force nor
intimidation used, which was necessary In
a case of robbery and it was clearly a
case of petty larceny.
- Hart has already served two terms for
petty larceny. Nothing is known against
Desmond, but the articles taken from the
girl were found in his possession when he
was searched. Â¦ ; .
The Board of Fire Commissioners will
not assume control of the Firemen's Mu
tual Aid Society without first establishing
its authority to do so in an action at law.
Suit to â¢ restrain the board from taking
further action toward gaining such con
trol was filed yesterday by George F.
Maxwell, through his attorneys, Lennon
& Hawkins. .
In the petition for an injunction, Max
well, who was the former secretary of the
board, alleges that in April, 1000, it passed
a resolution prohibiting members of the
department from maintaining any society
or association without its specific authori
zation. Subsequently, it is claimed, the
board endeavored to foist and force upon
the association a new set of bylaws and
though the members refused to comply
with the demands of the board, that body
recently ordered that an election of ofli
cers for a new association, under the new
bylaws, be held. Ballots were issued to
the members of the department with in
structions for them to vote, it is set forth,
"and," continues the petitioner, "mem
bers of the department are forced to obey
the instructions, being fearful that dis
obedience would result in the loss of their
position."
This action upon the part of the board,
It Is claimed, is for the purpose of layinr
a foundation to usurp and interfere with
the name of the society now In existence
to secure control of the funds and prop
erty of the society and to unreasonably
invade the private rights of the memDers
In conclusion it is stated by the petitioner
that the action taken by the board Is not
necessary for the discipline or efflciency
of the society. Hence the court is asked
to issue an injunction perpetually restrain
ing the board, the members of which are
Holla V. Watt, John H. Grady, M. H
Hecht and J. C. McKinstry, from count
ing the ballots that may have been sent
in for officers of the new society or other
wise interfering with the Firemen's Mu
tual Aid Society. â¢

MBS. PFAFF IS JtELEA&ED
' ON BAIL BY JXH3GE COOK
Woman Accused of Murder Allowed
Her Liberty in Order to Bury
Husband.
Mrs. Maggie Pfaff, who Is awaiting trial
on the charge of having killed her friend,
Mrs. Mamie Marvin, by throwing a light
ed lamp at her during a quarrel, was yes
terday released on $1000 ball by Judge Car
roll Cook.
Attorney Walter Gallagher had Mrs.
Pfaff produced before Judge Cook on a
writ of habeas corpus. The unfortunate
woman was escorted Into the courtroom
and wept bitterly during the proceedings.
Her husband, distracted by the accusa
tion against his wife, hanged himself a
few days ago.
Attorney Gallagher desired to argue the
habeas corpus proceedings, but the prose
cution stated that Stenographer Vernon
had not written up the testimony taken
in the Police Court.
Assistant District Attorney Whiting
was placed on the witness stand and de
tailed the principal evidence taken In the
lower court. He testified that he did not
think Mrs. Pfaff could be found guilty
of murder, but thought she might be con
victed of manslaughter.
Pending the preparation of the trans
cript of evidence given in the Police Court,
Judge Cook admitted Mrs. Pfaff to bail.
Two bondsmen were In waiting and she
at once made her way to the Morgue,
where her husband's body was lying. The
hearing of the writ of habeas corpus will
take place on Thursday morning. .
Edwin H. Conger, United States Minis
ter to China, left San Francisco last even
ing at 6 o'clock bound for his Iowa home.
Several hours before hla departure he re
ceived a message that he would find at
his disposal when he arrived at Ogden the
private car of Horace G. Burt, president
of the Union Pacific Railroad. Colonel
D. W. Hitchcock conveyed Mr. Burt's
tender to the Minister at the Occidental
Hotel and Minister Conger readily accept
ed the courtesy. It was also announced by
wire that John N. Baldwin, a well-known
politician of the Hawkeyo State, would
be in the railroad president's private car
to escort the Congers from Ogden to
Council BlufTs. 'â¢ . ,.
. The Minister will proceed directly via
the Union Pacific to the Missouri River.
He will arrive at the "Bluffs" early
Wednesday morning and thus be able to
receive the citizens of that place- and
make the trip from the river to Ues
Moines during the day.
All the indications point to Mr. Conger's
acceptance of the Republican nomination
for Governor of Iowa and this, of course,
means that the President must select
some other man to fill the important ofllce
of United States Minister to China. The
California delegation of seven Represent
atives and two Senators in Congress may
be able to convince the President that a
Calif ornian should be appointed to suc
ceed Mr. Conger. . f^^c^

It possessed youths who were good ath

the tremendous shouts of encouragement
that greeted them as they lined up for
each event. Small boys ran riot over the
grounds, despite the presence, of two po
licemen. The little fellows wanted to see
and a force of officers could not restrain
them.. They followed ; the runners round
the track and coached" them.' They 'got
in the way of the contestants and spoiled
the spectators' view, but cared nothing
of it. . . -

The bodies of two unknown men werÂ»
brought to the Morgue last night. Both
had ended their lives In the same man

were about the same age, and In the pock

One body was found in the water at

man. He drew it ashore and telephoned
for the Coroner's deputies. When they
arrived they had the utmost difficulty in
getting the body to their wagon and spent
three hours in carrying It up the steep
cliffs. The remains were those of a plain
ly dressed, gray-haired man, evidently
about 50 years of aee.
The second body was found In the Dev

at this point are more than 100 feet high
and the suicide had evidently Jumped
from that height into the water. Hi3
skull was badly crashed from contact
with the rocks.
Both bodies had been in the water about
an hour when found.

munication was regularly taken up at a meet
ing of the executive committee of the Res
taurant Keepers' Association held April 26,
1901.
Articles I and II were read, but after hear
ing them the committee aa a whole refused to
consider the document further. Being in dfrect

Keepers' Association it â¢ is Impossible for the
association to take any action on any part
of the agreement whatever until the same are
eliminated. Yours truly,
M. JOHNSON.
Chairman Ex. Com. Restaurant Keepers' Assn.
" The rejection of the agreement has
ended all attempts at arbitration, as the
proprietors say they will not recede from
the stand taken by them.
. Chairman . Johnson said last night: "
"The restaurant keepers have organized
and are prepared for battle. Let. the
Walters' Alliance submit another agree
ment with Â¦ the objectionable paragraphs
eliminated and we will have no trouble In
coming to terms; but as it is we positive
ly refuse to consider it. ~ â -.
Restaurant Owners Are Prepared.
: "Every restaurant, keeper of any note
in this city is a member of the organiza
tion and our financial condition Is such
that we are prepared for anything the
alliance may attempt. We expected this
thing and are prepared for It, both finan
cially and in' strength due to organiza
tion. . . .
"At present I am not prepared to state
what. will be done, but I can assure you
that when the strike or boycott or what
ever you choose to call it is over the res
taurants will still be running, and while
It is on our patrons -will be fed.
"The schedule, without the objection
able paragraphs, has our approval with
the exception of a few minor points. The
question of wage and hours of work we
have discussed frequently and the asso

covering these much mooted points,
which agrees with that submitted in al
most every; particular. However, we will

making a fight on a section of the agree

ATTOENEY GENERAL DENIES
COOK PERMISSION TO SUE
Rules Against Contention of ex-Jus
tice of Peace That He Is En
titled to Hold.
Attorney General Tirey.L. Ford has de-
,nied the application of former Justice of
the Peace G. W. F. Cook for leave to sue
In the name of the people of the State of
California to test the right of the present
Justices of the Peace to hold their re
spective offices. J
The application of Mr. Cook was refer
red to Deputy Attorney General William
M. Abbott, upon whose report the At
torney General bases his conclusions.
It was contended by Mr. Cook that the
term of office of Justice of the Peace of
the city and county of San Francisco was
four years Instead- of two, and that his
term of office had not expired when his
successor was elected at the last general
election. This contention, however, is re
solved against Mr. Cook by the Attorney
General, -who cites the case of Kahn vs.
Sutro, 114 Cal., 330, together with certain
statutory provisions, including portions of
the county government act, to show that
Mr. Cook is mistaken, and that- his. suc
cessor was properly elected in November
last. . -

FITZHUGH TO BE
HAYS' ASSISTANT
Southern Pacific After
Oriental Traffic Up
; North.
J > â . â
It -was definitely learned yesterday that
Â¦when E. H. Fitzhugh arrives here he will
take the office in the Southern Pacific as
assistant to President Hays. H. E. Hunt-
Ington will move from his present quar
ters, adjoining those of President Hays
In the Union Trust building, and Fitzhugh
will occupy them.
President Hays has mapped out a great
deal of hard work and he is figuring on
able assistance from Fitzhugh. The road
from Reno to Ogden, that is to be Im
proved and shortened, Involves an im
mense 2mount of work. When this road
has been finally finished it can be op
erated at much less expense and will
have facilities for handling more freight
The coast road has also to be recon
structed. It Is claimed that the con
tractor on this line did not build
the track as he was ordered to,
and that he laid rails around sharp curves
in and around the Salinas Valley to save
the expense of grading. It Is now ad
mitted that the travel to Los Angeles will
again revert to the old line and the coast
division will be used for tourist travel
only. All the fast trains in the future
running between San Francisco and Los
Angeles will be operated over the old
route.
The Oreeon tracks are said to be in
pood condition, but the business up In
the "Webfoot" State will take up a great
deal of Hays' attention. â¢ Active steps will
be taken at once by the Union Pacific and
the Southern Pacific officials combined to
take from the Northern Pacific. Canadian
Pacific and the Great Northern the Ori
ental trade.
President Hays will leave for Texas in
a few weeks. The Southern Pacific tracks
are in bad condition in that State and'
Hays will study the situation preliminary
to making extensive improvements.
The Pacific Improvement Company Is
anxious ot sell Del Monte to the Southern
Pacific Company, but President Hays
frowns down the idea. He is reported to
cave said in regard to tha matter:
"The Southern Pacific Company is In
the railroad business. We want to haul
freight and carry passengers. We don't
v.-ant to be in the hotel business."
What the Pacific Improvement Com
pany will do with the Del .Monte, is
a mystery. Those who Â»r# on the Inside
say that with the Southern Pacific and
the Pacific Improvement Company repre-
The revenue cutter service In this port
has been inefficient and practically worth
less for a long time and the complaints
on this head are loud and frequent. It
appears that the cutters Hartley and
Golden Gate are almost always laid up
for repairs. At present both are laid up
and the customs authorities are obliged
to hire small gasoline launches to do the
work for which the Treasury Department
has provided two crippled cutters.
When the news reached the Custom
house last Thursday that the Nippon
Maru had been sighted the Hartley and
Golden Gate were up for repairs and
Naval Officer John P. Irish and Customs
Surveyor Spear were obliged; to add to
the national debt the sum of $15 for the
hire of a small gasoline launch to take
the Federal officials to the steamship to
receive Minister Conger. While the quar
antine officers were inspecting the pas
sengers Colonel Irish, Deputy Surveyor
St. John and the United States immigra
tion inspectors on board the launch were
tossed about the deck of the launch in
the rough sea, a bone piercing gale from
the -west blowing: in the meantime.
When the word came that the medical
inspection was over and that the officials
might board the vessel Colonel Irish came
within an ace of losing his life.- Anxious
to be the first. on board, he caught hold
of the ship's ladder, and was about to
place one foot upon it when the launch
moved away from the side of the steam
ship and left him dangling between ths
ship and the launch, in danger of being
crushed between- the two or losing his
hold and falling into the bay. It was
only by the strength of his arms that
he succeeded In slowly hauling himself
out of danger, although for a time the
spectators held their breath in fear.' If
he had fallen In no power could have
saved him, as the waves were running
like a' millrace.
The customs officials have complained
time and again of the inadequate reve
nue cutter service, but Washington seems
deaf to their appeals. They say that it
is a common occurrence for the comman
ders of the cutters to report them in need
of repairs and oblige the officials to hire
gasoline . launches from private parties.
They say that such a state of things 'in
a port which collects for Uncle Sara $600 -
000 a month is disgraceful. .

aware. Judge Cook replied that the ques
tion must be decided by Federal courts,
and Knight retorted that he would take
such p. ste;>.
Finally, when Deuprey announced that
his reason for asking that the case be
set was to save the "sixty-day rule,"
Knight jumped to his feet and asked for
the defense that the case be set for that
date. Judge Cook thereupon set the trial
for June IS.
Mrs. Botkin was quickly taken from the
courtroom and escorted back to the
Branch County Jail. John P; Dunning is
now in the East, and it is not known if he
will return in order to be present at the
trial of the woman who murdered his wife
and sister-in-law.

"From" information brought by him we

sent to capture one of his camps. The
attack was made, but Cailles escaped.
He left behind him, however, valuable
papers, from which we learned that he

Noel Gaines, Thirty-ninth Infantry, late
chief of the secret service in Manila.
Captain Gaines is a Kentuckian. and the
knowledge of the police work which fitted
him for the dutle3 of secret service was
gained during five years' service as Sheriff
of Frankfort. County in the Blue Grass
State, the county in which the State capi

murdered, and where, the duties of Sheriff
require a man qf astuteness and courage.
Captain Gairies tells an interesting story
of his experience with the Filipino chiefs,
and their secret efforts to defeat the'
Americans. . ".'Â¦'.
Cailles Cannot Bs Overlooked.
:'- "There is one man in the islands," 'said
the captain yesterflay, "who will .bother
this country a great deal. I refer to Juan
Cailles, who has declared himself dictator
of Luzon. He is a man of great intelli
gence, wily, "full of resources land' when
necessary will fight like a demon. He is
the only one of the Filipino chiefs who
will givothe Americans battle, and is a
foe that cannot be overlooked. He lives
with his men, and leads, them in battle,
and is both loved and feared. He possesses
immense power, and his slightest wish is
executed as soon as it is made known.
"General Caille-5 never acknowledged the
supremacy of the Spanish Government,
preferring to keep up constant warfare
against the Dons. He would start fight
after fight and when pushed too closely
would leave the country until the time
was ripe for another attack^ He* would
then return; constantly harassing the
Spaniards. This is the sort of man the
United States will now have to deal with,
and until he surrenders or is killed there
will be no lej.-up of the guerrilla warfare
in the islands.

but not on the terms we propose.

"As chief of the secret service. I di

have brought him to. terms. We had'his

Members of the Grand Jury are averse
to discussing tne vote that reaulteu in
the adoption of the committee's report,
bome say it was unanimous; others say
it mi as ni-Â»t.
One juror approached yesterday de
clared mat the vote was unanimous.
"Did you vote for it?" was asked him.
"1 did not," he replied, '"but upon my
oath as a grand juror I really can't tell
you whether T did or not."
Another question that is being raised in
connection with the report is. Who was
the real author? Of course, editors of
weeklies are supposed to srind out copy
at an astonishing rate and when the tiles
of a paper containing full stenographic
reports are placed at the disposal of a
grand juror the sandwiching in of a few
words between the scissors and pastepot
parts give the editorial manipulator a
chance to swell his chest with pride,
stick his thumb into the mess and declare
"What a great grand juror am I?": So,
when; ancient- history was revived in the
report and oft told tales repeated, the
community was not as greatly shocked
as if would have been if the memory Â¦ of
the next to the oldest inhabitant did not
run so far back as three months ago.
Politicians are guessing, too, as to the
effect of Barry's rodomontade. An elec
tion for Mayor and other city offices is to
be held six months hence. Is the disao
pointed Congressional ambition Qf Barry
to be satisfied with a plum- that
mean being the local Czar? is a question
they ask. If not so, what other job may
he be seeking that he hath grown so
suddenly great? Upon what meat doth'
this grand juror feed?, is asked.
That is the question that is dividing the
political campus into lines not designated
by the whitewash brush. Then there are
personal feelings existing between Bany
and the Chief of Police. When the latter
started on his crusade enforcing the or
dinance against partitions in. saloons be
ing more than six feet high Barry went
to Chief Sullivan and made a piteous ap
peal that his friend, former Â¦ Under Sher
iff Clack, who now and then conducts a
saloon at the corner of Haleht and
Gough streets, should be exempted from
compliance with the law. \
I Sullivan shook his head and Clack's
partitions were cut down. Barry swore
revenge. His prepared report is the se
quel. , "â¢Â¦Â¦. .
â¢ Then again crops up the old, old storv
of the Esola fight. t Wise- ones say that
Barry espoused the cause of the Exam
iner's' candidate. "Force Sullivan to re
sign" is the slogan of the clan. But Sul
livan stands pat. Mayor Phelan will not
remove him. He will not resign and while
the various acts of. this political farce
comedy are being enacted people are won
dering whence will come the next in
spiration of the Grand Jury.
â¢ So far, Mayor Phelan and Chief of Po
lice Sullivan hold the whip hand. T*ie
members of the Grand Jury have until
Friday, to guess what will' be their next
move.- No indictment against anybody
could be found with the evidence in their
hands. Â¦ .,.Â¦Â¦- '. Â¦ ; â¢ . ....

JUAN CAILLES, THE SELF-STYLED DICTATOR
OF LUZON, IS DESCRIBED AS A FIERCE FIGHTER
AND A MAN OF MORE THAN ORDINARY ABILITY
MANY prominent army officers
with reputations for bravery on
the field of battle, around whom
have been_ woven tales of heroic
deeds and of valorous conduct
while in the Philippines, have . passed
through this city. Now- comes an officer
whose work has been that of /"a. desk offi
cer." No stories of long marches or hot
skirmishes have been written about him,
Â¦but 'he has done more, nevertheless, to
coin would be restored If he surrendered.
Our efforts seemed about to prove suc
cessful, when a lot of the dictator's prl
.vate effects and papers were unearthed,
and we found that It was by 'his order
.that the wholesale murdering of friendly
natives had been committed.
â¢ VThis, of course, ended our negotiations
so far as the treatment we had been
promising him if he surrendered was con
cerned. The understanding previous to
the discovery of these papers was that

COMMODORE W. N. MCCARTHY, WHO WILL PRESIDE? OVER THE DESTI
NIES OF THE SAN FRANCISCO YACHT CLUB DURING THE COMING
SEASON, AND THE DIRECTORS WHO WILL. ASSIST HIM.
The San Francisco Flycasting Club
held its fourth Saturday contest at Stow
Lake yesterday. On account of the high
wind casting was anything but pleasant.
The members were greatly pleased with
the new platform and other Improvements
and the number of those taking part Is
rapidly Increasing as the season advances.
In the long-distance event Brotherton led,
with the score of 111 feet. In accuracy
Everett won, with 91.4 per cent, and Mr.
Mansfield in delicacy, with 84.2.
The detailed score is as follows: > ;

Â¦were of the sensational order. In, all ten
short-ends got decisions which, in a stake
of this size, is a fair average. The length
of the odds, however, tell a different
story and to the piker who figures an
extra long price a good bet, even if i'jsc,
the day will remain a pleasant dream..
Harlean Gladys beat Mose, For ulory
outpointed Warship and Forest Queen got
the Has from Athena at & to 3. Agamem
non in the opening course took the honors
from Dewdrop, a 4 to 1 favorite, and at
the same figure Bohe celebrated her reap
pearance at the game by leaving Chicago
Boy behind in the score when she fin
ished the." course. ' Deckelman's clever
Lawrence failed to score against the
Pasha Kennels' Random Aim, though the
wise ones" were liberal in their ' offers cf
5 to 1 that he Â¦would return 'a. winner.
Tapioca, D. J. Healy's young- â¢ courser,
failed to make good the form players' pre
diction that he would have his colors dis
played at the finish of his go with Ran
dom Aim.. He proved expensive dessert
for his admirers, who backed their jud~
ment at the rate of 10 to 1 that the Peta
luma good one could land the decisio u
Mountain Belle-ran away from . McKinicy
and refused him a point, though he wa.3
a 2 to 1 favorite- over her.
Roman Athlete held tha clever Mayflow
er too cheap and It cost the talent con
siderable to learn the result. Mayflower
was on the small end at 1 to 6. The last
of the upsets was the defeat of Game Boy
by the clever Pretender puppy Elista.
Seven to 1 was freely offered on the Boy.
Gold Bus made a good showing against
Controller leading- him a eood three
lengths. He is a full brother of Firm Fel
low, another good one, and the litter has
shown itself the fastest of .the Firm
Friend get.
Fontenoy ran a slashing course against
Master Rocket, although he lost.
For Glory and Harlean Gladys, the lat
ter the choice, are the best at the top
of the card for stake honors. Flying:
Fox, Narcissus and Wedgewood, the last
named favored, are the pick at the bot
tom. .
The wonners in the second round should
be Fiery Face, Liberator, Fine Fire, Hon

All the Interest In the ball game at
necre&tioo grounds yesterday afternoon
wes centered In the ninth Inning:, when
the BrurorncJs almost tied the score. The
beard read Â«-2 In favor of the local team
and thea the Dudes took on a spurt that
for a tin* looked as if it would land them
on top.'
LohmffC Drennan and Francks were on

re-!lanes hit to rtcht and Lohman aiul
Drennan scored. Streib, who followed, hit
to Hildebrmd, and Hildy dropped the ball,
the ba^s being filled again. Then Dun
let vy went out, but Francks scored on the
play. A base on balls to Moore once more
crowded the sacks. It was up to Moski
xnan to win thÂ« game, but he fouled out
to Pabst and the game was over.
Pabst had the distinction of knocking
out a double in the third Inning which
brought in three runs. Croll, Krug and
Holland were decorating the sacks when
the brewer rolled one out to deep center
end all three runners tripped it merrily
for home honors. In the sixth the local
teem scored twice on errors and a single

CALIFORNIA 1 .
There were threa startling features to
the gameâOverall's spasmodic brilliant
pit chlng, plethoric errors on both sides
and a pugnacious spirit on the part of the
youthful collegians, which resulted in one
Instance in actual recalcitrancy and In an
otix r lr threatened blows by eighteen par
t'.cipants of the company.
California started off in the first part of
the game by scoring a couple of runs, but
in the fifth and sixth innings the Red
a;n&Â«sed four tallies. Then the boy with
the red socks pulled his trousers up and
waved his legs. After a while there came
the seventh inning- and then the Califor
nia swatters fell on Parker for five hits
end as many runs. Overall, with the ex
ception of the fifth inning, pitched sen
sational baseball. He struck out thirteen
men. and in one inning retired three, who
di-.i fancy stunts with the air.
Tho two captains, Hunter of California
and Edwards of Stanford, showed the bel
licose color and nearly precipitated a gen
eral intercollegiate war. Hunter tore the
earth from the. first to the second bag- on
the fly and tfutted into Edwards at sec
ond. Edwards lost his temper and, think
ing that he belonged to the French school
?f bo Â£r in Â£ f ea Z? Hunter a feel of his toe.
Jim McDonald separated the scrappers.

Track Notes.
Harry Spencer, the California rider, has
again been granted a license by the
Jockey Club stewards. Last season his
licence was revoked for a supposed bad
rid. on the Keene colt Commando.
IT took all of Nash Turner's splendid
horsemanship to land Flora Pomona
winner of the Gebhard handicap at
Tanforan yesterday. After twice
finishing: second to the crack Corrl
gan for the Great Trial and Western Foal
stakes the game filly carried top weight,
116 pounds, and in a long drive led Divina
out a neck, the PVturity course being-
Stepped in 1:11. As Turner is easily the
peer of the riders here now, the majority
of the big crowd present wanted a ticket
on the Schulte entry. Sounder a steady
play the price receded from 5 to 2 to 8 to
5. Doreen, from the Burns & 'Vv'aterhouse
stable, had second call, while nearly all
cf the other seven Â¦were accorded some
sort of support. Breaking away- only
once. Starter Jake Holtman at the next
attempt dropped his flag to the prettiest
two-year-old start of the season.
â¢; Turner Goes to the Front.
Turner on the favorite drawing the in
side position, immediately went for the
lead. Only once was he headed, and then
by Doreen. Turning the bend for home
the latter had enough, but there was no
rest for Flora. Divina, with Hafley in
the saddle, came fast on the outside, and
in a fierce finish lost by a neck only. Sis
ter Jeanie, one or the Jennings entries,
aowned Louwelsea for the show. Sol
Lichtenstein ran a disappointing race,
never looking dangerous. The gross value
of thÂ« stake was $2000, of whicn amount
$1500 went to the winner.
As the occasion marked the closing of
the season at the San Mateo course the
attendance was unusually large. Mike
Rice and Graham Greene scored at long
odds, while Frank Bell. Flora Pomona
and Gotobed maintained the prestige of
the favorites.
Frank Weir's Ralston was touted as a
piece of easy money for the first event,
at six furlongs. Freely backed at even
money, he was defeated very easily by
Mike Rice, aeainst which some 20 "to 1
was laid. McAlbert ran Into the show.
Then twelve maiden two-year-olds gal
loped over to the barrier. Vasallo,, the
mount of J. Itansch, ruled favorite, and
met with his usual luck, getting cut off
soon after the start Graham Greene, a
30 to 1 shot, piloted by J. Martin, met
with no -squally weather, and, leading all
the way, won by half a length from Mur
cia, one of the second choices. Vasallo
closed well, losing the show only .by a
neck to Lady Carlo. .- â¢
Equals the Track Becord.
Doughty Frank Bell shouldered 121
pounds and Nash Turner, and In
the ' five and a half furlong: dash
for all ages equaled the track rec
ord of 1:06%. The son of Big Henry was
favorite in the ring and, out in front
from the start, breezed in a length before
Hagerdon. Hermoso displayed no speed
whatever, third place falling to Doublet.
W. O'B. Macdonough's colt, Beau
Ormonde, ridden by Johnny Sullivan, let
the talent down over his defeat by Ber
nota in the mile free handicap. The 109
pounds seemed to set very heavily on his
back, for when ready Ransch on Ber
nota walked by him, winning almost eas
ily in 1:41%. Ten lengths off The Fretter
finished a poor third.
Although the thermometer showed the
odds on Gotobed to be ascending in tho
betting on the final mile run the bay
horse got to the wire first. Taking the
lead before the stretch was reached. Con
ley landed him first, a head In front of
Merops. Filon d'Or swerved as the bar
rier was sprung, ruining his chances.

Mrs. McMillan gave the alarm and Im
mediately a posse was organized to hunt
down the negroes. The posse In a couple
of hours came across "Wesley Lewis, one
of the supposed assailants, who tried to
hide In the bushes. He was handcuffed
and brought under guard to the Fayette
Countv Jail, where he Is now behind the
bars. Bessie "Wares and Lizzie Jones, the
two colored women implicated in the as
sault, were also locked up in Unlontown.
In the meantime word had spread
throughout all Fayette County and a
great number of white men are now
scouring the foothills of the Alleghenies
in the hope of finding the other five ne
groes.
McMillan fell at his door, but before
fleeing the negroes shot at his prostrate
body, another bul'et lodging in the fallen
man near the kidneys. For some time
after the negroes had fled the husband
lay at his door bleeding and his wife lay
unconscious behind the outbuilding, about
fifty feet away. The woman came to her
senses first and found her husband.
Leaving their victim prostrated, the
men gave their atteption to the frantlo
husband, who had been engaged In battle
with one oe more of the men throughout
this terrible ordeal. McMillan broke from
his assailants, and as he darted back Into
his house one of the negroes, evidently
thinking that he was eoing for a gun or
revolver, shot him through the body Just
below the heart.
McMillan's house sits back from ths
highway, near the old Oliphant furnace.
McMillan is about 40 years old, but his
wife Is a young woman, and the two were
alone. Suddenly eight negroes. In the par
ty being two black women, came from
hiding and attacked the house. The men
burst in the door, dragged Mrs. McMillan
from her husband's arms and carried her
out behind the outbuilding, where the six
men assaulted her.
CONNELLSVILLE. Pa.. April 27.â The

At 11:30 p. m. the jury notified the court
that there was no immediate prospect of
an agreement being reached, whereupon
the Judge went home. The consensus of
opinion seems to be that the jury will not
reach an agreement.
The evening session of the Callahan
case was surprisingly brief, as the de
fense waived its right to address the jury.
This action Â¦was apparently taken in order
that the . more skilled talent of the State
might suffer a similar deprivation. The
instructions to the jury were lengthy and
without feature.
The State sought to show that Callahan
had been in the reform school, but was
not permitted to do so. Callahan admitted
that he had been convicted of robbery In
this court. He denied that he had been
convicted of burglary. He said he had
known Crowe for twelve or fourteen
years. He said he did not know what
Crowe was doing except what Crowe told
him. Callahan said Crowe had a hard
name and had asked him not to use his
right name If he met any friends when
they were together, and should not intro
duce him. He admitted that he drove
with Crowe a couple of times. He thought
the buggy belonged to Gillan, Crowe's
brother-in-law, at South Omaha. The de
fendant testified that Crowe never stopped
at Mrs. Kelly's longer than a few mo
ments.
The early afternoon was occupied with
the testimony of Callahan in his own be
half. His story was a series of denials of
all theNallegations of the State. He said
he spent the afternoon of December 18
at home and In the evening played cards
at Orff's saloon in South Omaha,
Mamie McDonald, the little daughter of
the preceding witness, proved an unfor
tunate witness for the defense. She said
she remembered a man named Johnson
who often visited Callahan and had heard
It whispered that he was Pat Crowe.
Frank Hensman, a paper carrier, testi
fied to having seen Callahan daily at Mrs.
Kelly's house as he made his rounds. He
delivered his papers between 3:30 and 5
p. m. and had an impression that he saw
Callahan at the house on December 18.
He felt some doubt, however, as to the
exact date. James Gillan. another car
rier, remembered seeing Callahan spend
ing his time in Henry Orff's saloon, when
he was supposed to be absent on his kid
naping mission. He also was not positive
as to the date.
OMAHA, April 27.â The Callahan case
was reopened this morning with James
McDonald on. the stand. McDonald testi
fied that he and Callahan were together
between 3 and 4 o'clock on the day of the
kidnaping. On cross-examination McDon
ald said Callahan was very nervous. He
admitted that he had recently told the
detectives that he was not quite sure
whemer It was December 18 or on the
day or second day following.

TJNDEBTAKER A2TD DOCTOB
IN SUSPICIOUS CASE
Attempt to Bury Body of Governess
Bouillaguet Without In vesti-
gation Required.
Coroner Leland Is investigating certain
suspicious ' circumstances connected with
the death of Miss Jane Bouillaguet. a
French governess, who was employed in
the family of Jules Levy at 2510 Jackson
street. The lady died of pelvic blood pois
oning, but Dr. R. E. Bunker, the attend
ing physician., neglected to call the atten
tion of the Coroner to that fact, as re
quired by the rules. He merely sent in
a certificate giving the cause of death as
"Septicaemia following opening of pelvic
abscess, contributing cause salplngttls
nnd anaemia." nnd stating that he had<
"attended deceased" from April 7, 1901, to
Anrll 26. 1901."
The first and only person to call the
attention of the Coroner to the fact that
there were suspicious circumstances con
nected with the woman's death was Jules
Levy, the woman's employer. Mr. Levy
notified the Coroner that Miss Boutllaguet
left his house about the 7th of April to
be treated for an affection of the stom
ach, and that he heard nothing more of
her until he learned thRt she had died
at the Bellevue Sanitarium. When the
certificate was presented for the Coroner's
approval, which is a condition precedent
to burial, the Coroner refused to sign it,
and ordered Undertaker Martin to bring
the body to the Morgue in order that an
autopsy might be performed. The Cor
oner learned further that 'Undertaker
Martin, contrary to the rule, had em
balmed the bodv.
"I had given positive orders to all un
dertakers that they should not iniect bod
ies In cases of septicaemia without my
permission, and Undertaker Martin has
violated my order knowingly and Inten
tionally," said Coroner Leland yesterday.

W.5 WASHINGTON, April 27.â Important
action may be taken by the War DepartA
ment this summer in reference to the Pa
cific transport service. While immediate
action may not be taken on the proposi
tion to divert a portion of the present
transport business to a private line of
steamships, the administration appears
favorable to the suspestion that some of
tbo transports be v;ithdrawn later on.
If this is done part of the Government
business to the Orient, which Is bound to
be large and nermanent, will be divertoÂ»l
to private lines. However. It is not prob
able that the entire transport service will
be withdrawn, as has been suggested.

OAKLAND, April 27.â The great
work of philanthropy which Mrs.
F. M. Smith has planned as her
' life-work was fairly launched to
day and Marion Cottage, which
was dedicated this afternoon, has become
an established fact. The ten youthful In
mates of the cottage spoke with beaming
faces of their happiness in their new sur
roundings and their glad smiles were a
tribute to the great heart of the woman
Â¦who has thus assured their future comfort
and welfare.
The cottage stands on a prominence ad
joining the grounds of Mrs. Smith's resi
dence, and in honor of the dedication was
to-day tastefully decorated in pink and
green. Across the front of the house the
v;ords "Marion Cottage" were wrought in
pink geraniums against a background.

General Gleaves says that his company
Â¦will pav the holders of Its debenture
bonds to the last dollar of their Invest

Following the attack on them made by
Insurance Commissioner Clunie the de
benture compar-les tried to secure legis
lation that woÂ«M rut them under th* In
fraction of the Bank Commissioners. That
failed and a b'll providing: for the denoslt

The form of the debentures of this com
pnny is such that when $30. or twelve
monthly payments, has been made, pay
ment may stop without forfeiture of the
nmor.Tit invested. That -will doubtless
ftirnlrh the solution to the Investors' prob
lem. They will stop payment and wait
for the liquidation of their coupons as fast
as acs^ts are available. Most of them.
v.ilMns'ly or reluctantly as the case may
ne. TviM consent probably to the oil In
vestr-^nt rather than take their chances
writine for fi'nd* to accumulate.
If any Investor in debentures considers
that transferring his money to oil stock
would be jumping out of the frying pan
into the fire, he can refuse to give his
consent. If he kteps on paying in $2 50
per month for the remainder of the twen
ty-year period, his bond will have to be
redeemed then for J10Wâ provided that
The company does not go into the hands
of a receiver before that time.
In the event of any holders of deben
tures refusing to give written consent to
the conversion of the debenture company
Into an oil company, General Gleaves says
that the company will remain In exist
ence, making no further sale of deben
tures, but redeeming: those now outstand
ing aÂ« fast as they mature.
The oil company proposition involves
the cancellation of debentures outstand
ing and the issuance to the holders of
them their proportionate shares in the
capital stock of the oil company.
Oil Stock for Holders of Bonds.
At the meeting Friday night such a
course was determined upon, and a com
mittee consisting of General James M.
Oleaves, president of the company, Oeorge
R. McMullen, its secretary, and I. J. Tru
man Jr., its attorney, was appointed to
effect the necessary changes In the arti
cles of incorporation. The consent of the
holders of some 300 debenture bonds that
are outstanding: will have to be secured
before such change can be made. Presi
dent Gleaves claims that many of these
Investors are anxious to go Into oil and
have Importuned the directors to do what
will now be attempted.
When a company has Incorporated and
Bold bonds, even when those bonds are of
the debenture eort. g-olng- out of business
Is not such a staple matter. In this case
It becomes still more complicated because
of a proposition to reincorporate as an
oil company and Invest the assets of the
debenture company in developing oil lands
In Lake County.
The stockholders ef the Home Deben
ture Investment Company met Friday
nleht at the eoir.pany'e office In the Par
rott building and adopted a. resolution to
quit the debenture business. Of the 995
shares of stock, 6S4 were represented ej
the meeting-, and the holders of the re
maining shares are said to be In sym
pathy with thÂ« abandonment Â©f the ta
booed enterprise.
The finish of the debenture companies
apparently Is In sight. OnÂ« of them has
already decided to jro out of business, and
Attorney General Ford, agreeing with the
Insurance Commissioners and the Build
ing end Loan Commissioners that such
companies are vicious In principle, will
bring action to force the remainder of
them to close up their affairs unless they
consent to do po voluntarily.

WRECKS A POUND

Larkspur. ' (
LARKSPUR, April 27.â Poundmaster
and Constable A. J. Marriott to-day
swore out a warrant charging W. H. Ma
honey, the San Francisco attorney, who
resides here, with having wrecked the
village pound. In the complaint Mr. Ma
honey is accused of malicious mischief.
Poundmaster Marriott yesterday dis
covered a clew that led him to believe
that a vandal was at work in the town.
At the Brown residence he found four
pickets gnawed from the front gate. At
the Vescera home a hammock, had been
torn down. By careful stalking and
clever footwork Poundman- Marriott fol
lowed these shadowy clews and was re
warded by catching Mahoney's horse at
large upon- the land of President Wright
of the Larkspur Land Company. Tho
horse was led away to the pound.
When Mr. Mahoney heard. of the plight
of his Industrious horse his rage knew
no bounds. AVith. his. trusty ax he Carrle
nationed the pound and led his equine pet
home. . . s !'jS
Mr. Mahoney has had more : than
twenty lawsuits with President Wright
over roadways and the Larkspur water
service. The feud was supposed to have
been dead until to-day. . ..;, Â¦: â¢-;

REDDING, April 27.â Vincent J. Engle,
a pioneer resident of French Gulch, is
the latest victim of the hunter "who
thought he was a deer." Engle was badly
wounded by Emilo G. Martinez, a fellow
townsman, but it is believed he will re
cover. ,' - - ,
Engle left home early this morning on
a short prospecting trip. Later in .the day
Martinez started over the hills in search
of a missing cow. When about two miles
from home he saw a movement in some
brush, and, believing it was caused by a
wild animal of some species, he fired two
shots in its direction. A human cry of
pain drew him in horror to .the spot,
where he found Engle writhing on the
ground. One bullet had entered Engle' s
groin and passed through the hip. The
victim of the regrettable accident was
brought to Redding this evening and is
being cared for by the Odd Fellows, of
which order he is a member. ' ...

BICE TO BE PLANTED
' ON BECLAIMED LANDS
STOCKTON, April 27.â R. P. Lone is to
make a scientific experiment In rice" cul
ture on the tract of the Old River Land
and Reclamation Company. Mr. Lane has
been Interested in the project by C. Louis
Smith, who Is visiting here from Louis
iana. Mr. Smith tells of the building up
of that country by the rice fields, recall
ing the rise in the price of land .from $3
an acre to- 5150. This has been done In
many instances In the face, of the fact
that water rights cost $20 an acre and
rent the same. Yet with all this, from. $30
to $40 clear was made off each acre. Here
the water would be of practically no ex
pense.
There are different varieties of rice
which thrive In different soils and the
proposition is now to give all a trial. Mr.
Lane says that he does not see why
Chinese and- Japanese, who farm much
of the river bottoms, should not know how
to cultivate rice. If it can be demonstrat
ed that rice can be grown profitably here
he will get capital to put In big tracts.

prospects are reported all that could be de
sired.
â¢ Chicago was firmer on better foreign advices
and the Southwest bought freely on damage
reports from that section. The Hessian fly la
said to be getting serious in Kansas. Com

Increased less than $900,000, the result is shown
In addition of fl.S37.C7S to surplus, bringing
the total to $16,759,773. Needlees to cay. this
Is a favorable exhibit, coming as lt does in
the face of an Impending gold movement. The
banks lost to the Treasury during the week,
but remittances from the interior more than
made up these decreases. The expansion of
$2,877,600 In loans is a moderate reflection of
the enormous dealings en the New York Stock
Exchange of late, and there is reason to be
lieve that the loan item, which has fallen
thirty millions of dollars since March 9 last,
will begin to reflect soon the results of this
trading. The requirements for syndicate pur
poses have been largely met and the decreases
that have occurred for six weeks pas; arc
traceable to the consummation of some of the
deals. The contraction, it is to be noted, has
had ecarcely more than an appreciable t-ffect
on the money market, but it lias resulted in
a flow of money to this center from interior
points, and this really has been the influence
that has kept rates on a stable ba>?ls. The
surplus reserve is about six millions in ex
cpss of the amount reported when loans and
<>p<wits were at a maximum. Considering the
exports of gold and constant absorptions of
funds by ihe Treasury, this ts a very satisfac
tory showing. The factor which will govern
the money market in the immediate future is
the problematical export of specie in payment
cl American subscriptions to the Britl&h loan.
Jt would be Idle to estimate With any preten
sion of accuracy the volume of gold which will
be shipped, but that more or less gold will
go out is regarded certain. With the reserve
at its present figure and with the certain
knowledge that ri^es In money rates will at
tract Interior .funds, the banks can afTord to
part with considerable ei>ec!e without ir.con
\en!ence. The tu>Mson is approaching when
supplies of goM win be forthcoming from orig
inal sourcesâthat is, frcm Alaska, etc.. and
these will serve to replenish domestic losses.
Then, too. the approaching summer will wit
ness in ail probability h reversal of the Treas
ury relation* wuii the banks, so far as excess
receipts are concerned.
FLOW OP BIVERS.
For the consideration of the corn trade there
were reports of freer country acceptances. It
was said that country holders, who for months
have evinced a disposition to hold tightly to
their corn, were willing of a sudden to sell
quantities aggregating 1,000,000 bushels, as the
effect of this was to create bearish sentiment
in the pit. and for a few minutes Phillips, the
bull leader, did some active bidding to sup
port the market. He was aided by an im
provement in the cash situation and during
the remainder of the session the market held
steady. Business was comparatively light,
many traders having deserted to the superior
attractions of the buoyant wheat traffic May
closed unchanged at 4S%c. July closed %@Vic
higher.
Strength characterized the oats market, due
to strong cash demand and unfavorable weath
er. May closed %&%c fclgher at~ 26%fg)27c.
Provisions were dull. Buying of pork by a
packer advanced that product and held the
rest of the list against the easier tendency
engendered by a drop in hog prices. July
pork closed 12%c higher, lard unchanged and
ribs a shade down.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
CHICAGO, April 27. â The market for wheat
was the broadest In weeks. May opened %c to
%c higher at 73^ic to 73%c and without mate
rial reverses advanced firmly to 74%c and
closed l%c higher at 74%c The day's news
developed a feeling of cheerful bullishness. To
srtart with Liverpool cables showed a good ad
vance and the spot market revealed renewed
strength. Receipts were moderate and con
tinental tidings were favorable to holders of
wheat. Broomhall reported that the week's
sales to the Continent aggregated 5,000,000
bushels,. 3,000,000 bushels of lt to Hamburg.
During the half-day session New York export
ers -advised of forty-two loads taken for the
foreign account, while cash sales here of mixed
grades reached a total of 500,000 bushels.
Texas Bent further reports of damages, claim-
Ing that in portions of the State the crop was
a total loss. Other Southwestern points noted
the baneful Incursion of insects, notably Okla
homa. Bankers in the latter territory predict
ed the loss of half the crop. At the opening
large quantities of wheat were for sale, but
this condition 6peedlly gave way in the face
of the strong demand and thereafter it was
found necessary to increase bids in order to
fill buying orders. The volume of business
was large, but was chiefly for the local ac
count.

Business In general was good here to-day.
There was more of the talk reported yester
day of a broad revival" of speculative activity
now that the war loan Is over. The new bonds
were at a premium of % per cent to-day.
American shares were strong, but trading in
them lacked fire, owing to the holiday in New
York. They began well, nevertheless, and har
dened right up to the close. Which was cheer
ful. The buying of Northern Pacifies and
De-nvers was good. Denvers were taken here
on the rumors of big developments in the
Southwest soon to mature. A satisfactory
bank statement was expected from the Associ
ated Banks of New York.

urday. Cherries were steady, though receipts
were larger. Oranges were in moderate sup
ply and firm, with 10 or 12 cars announced for
to-morrow's auction. Limes were slightly
higher, in spite of the cold weather.
Uad reports of frost damage are coming In
from almost all sections. Ice has formed for
several mornings in different counties, and
young fruit cannot stand such low tempera
tures. Receipts of Strawberries have already
been affected. The Apricot crop will probably
be extremely light and Pears will be short
from present indications, while no fruit Is ex
pected to yield a full crop. ' Prices ought to
be above the normal this year, but it Is un
safe to make any predictions.
