Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Aug. 8.â Two
masked robbers held up the players in a
poker game at Sirdar, near Nelson, in the
Kootenay, last night. Three hundred
dollars that was on the tables at the time
Â¦was secured as well as half a dozen
watches, two diamond rings and some
light trinkets.
There were several men sitting at* the
poker table and three others were playing
black jack. The side door was suddenly
opened and the front door swung wide at
the same time. Two men with long white
masks over their faces walked in. One
called out "Hands up," and the men who
tvere now standing around the tables at
ence complied with the command.
Without another word one of the rob
bers proceeded in a cool fashion to range
the players up in a row down the center
of the room. One man tried to pull his
revolver, but he was hit on the head with
the butt of the robber's pistol and was
still unconscious when the desperadoes
decamped.
One of the robbers went through the
pockets of the men and took all the Jew
elry he could find. AH the money on the
tables was made into one pot and put in
a sack which one of the robbers carried.
The robber who covered the row of men
with his pistol did not say a word during
the whole affair. It is supposed that he
was well known in the camp and was
afraid of having his voice recognized. The
robbers got clear away and are probably
across the line before this.

FORT SCOTT. Kans.. Aug. 8.â A jury
of prominent men in a Justice Court here
found Rev. Mr. Price, presiding elder of
the Methodist church in this district,
guilty of malicious prosecution in a liquor
case. The defendant was acquitted and
the costs were assessed against the' cler
gyman. The defendant was the keeper of
a saloon that has been running wide open
and several witnesses readily admitted
having purchased liquor at the place. Rev.
Mr. Price having bought some for the

verdict is the result of a bitter fight for

Husband and Wife Shot.
DENVER, Aug. 8.â Mrs. Phillip P.
Hitchcock, wife of a prominent' railroad
man, to-day shot and seriously, if not fa
tally, wounded James W. Roberts and his
wife in their candy store on Sixteenth
street. The woman was shot in the face
and the man received two bullets, one in.
the middle of the forehead. It was at
first thought that the man was killed,
but at the hospital he revived- and the
physicians hope for recovery of both.
Jealousy was the cause of the shooting.
skipped out of Crockett and fled to San
Rafael. He is a cool, quiet and exces
sively reserved man, so his neighbors say.
They know little of him beyond this. Ac
cording to his own story he always had
money, which he was in the habit of
burying in the earth simply because he
did not care to trouble himself with
banks. A pistol-shot of no mean attain
ments, he constantly practiced shooting
on his small acreage in the hills half a
mile from the Selby Smelting Works s ,
where he was formerly employed.
Winters Flees to San Rafael.
Winters lived in a cabin on the hillside
and showed no disposition for af
filiation with* men or women. In
Â¦%nd near this cabin the police
have found all the material evidences
which they claim will fasten the guilt
upon him. Winters left Crockett on Tues
day afternoon and took his bicycle with
him. On that evening he reached San
Rafael and stopped at the Cosmopolitan
Hotel, owned by Mrs. Spencer, whom
Winters knew fairly well. It was report
ed that he and Miss Ida Spencer, the
daughter of the hotel proprietor, had
something of a heart affair between them,
but this the young lady denies. At the
Cosmopolitan Winters was found by De
tective Gibson and brought to the city.
* Damaging' Evidence Found.
And now for those circumstances which
weave a web of incrimlnation about John
Winters. With the occupant away the
detectives searched the cabin on Tuesday
and Wednesday and Â¦ found many sus
picious material evidences, which caused
them to make the arrest Chalk of the
i same quality and - seeming composition
and of similar appearance to that found
in the hole where the robber worked was
discovered in the cabin.
The slat frame, covered with black cloth
and used to cover the entrance to the
tunnel when the robber was resting from
his labors, will be a valuable piece of evi
dence. In Winters' cabin was found black
cloth of the same texture as that used
on the frame and similar slats were dis
covered on the premises. The tacks used
by the robber in constructing the frame
were of a peculiar kind and their dupli
cates were found In Winters' cabin.

Â¦ Winters ? will talk freely of, his actions
and himself. He is cool, calm and collect
ed and speaks with great deliberateness,
.which may be due either to the fact that
he is a foreigner or that he is careful of

I threw- away my* pantaloons; on \ Monday

that I threw my coat Into the bay:. I "think It
was on Saturday. I burned my" trousers be

them. The reason I had for, getting rid of the
coat was because, it was worn from constant

Winters was-allowed to tell his own tale.
If runs as follows:
My no me Is John "Winters, but I am better
known â¢ as "Buck" Taylor. I was born In
Koentgsberg, P.russia. I have been in th'-
United States for twenty years. I first landed
In New York City and : stayed there for three
days. I then went to St." Louis and remained
only a short time and then went to i Texas,

8:30 Monday night in the' vicinity of the
smelter, and on four or five occasions was
discovered near the hole. ','"Â¦- Â¦ Â¦Â¦'!:,
Hat Found in the Tunnel.
A suspicious circumstance . is furnished
by the remains of fires that Winters set
in front of the house. He says he always
burned his clothes when they were worn
out. Charred buttons told this tale. The
police hold this is rather a strange habit.
The hole through which the thief crawled
was jagged and must, have torn the
clothes of the one who removed the bul
lion, and the detectives â¢ think this ex
plains the fires in-the-front-of the house.
While conducting the inquisition of the
prisoner in Captain Seymour's office tDe
tective McParland noticed " that on Win
ters' right hand recent callous-lumps ..-had
been formed, while the left was as soft

of the stolen gold from Selby's
Smelting Works as being within
a quarter of a mile from the
scene of the robbery and hidden
from view by the waters of the
bay. Search this morning of the cabin
of John Wintersâ known as Buck Taylorâ
strengthened this theory- Beneath the
floor of the cabin was found an Iron rod
nine feet long with a sharp hook and a
pointed spear attached, similar to a boat
hook, and a pair of oars. A sounding line

strengthen the theory that the thief of

WASHINGTON, Aug. 8. â Admiral
Kempff has forwarded to the Navy De
partment an official report, thrilling In
its details, of the biting off of the leg of
Quartermaster S. McKie, third class, of
the gunboat Annapolis, by a shark or
other mammoth sea monster.
The Annapolis has been stationed of
late at Hollo, and on June 24 last a party
was sent out for rifle target practice.
Commander Rohrer, in command of the
Annapolis, states that permission was
given to several of the men to go swim
ming while the others were engaged In
firing. Two of the men had been in for
some time when McKle, who joined them,
asked if they had been able to touch bot
tom. Being answered In thÂ» negative, ho
made a dive and was gone for several
seconds. One of the seamen says ho
heard a gurgling sound beneath thÂ»
water. A moment later McKie appeared
on' the surface and shouted. ''Shark
shark!" Tha surface of the water was
covered with blood near where he cams
up. McKie started to swim, and. al
though crippled, reached the boat and was
pulled In by his companions. A horrible
sight met their eyes, the quartermaster's
av^ ng U. bee1 } y" en off near the knee.
With- all dispatch he was taken aboard
the Annapolis, where the surgeon found
it necessary to amputate the limb be
tween the knee and hip. The surgeon in
his report states that while the accident
was not In line of duty It was Incident to
the service. Admiral Kempff, however
in - indorsing the papers, holds that as
Quartermaster McKie had received per
mission from the officer in charge to go
in bathing the accident occurred In the
line or duty. Under these circumstances
the crippled quartermaster ? probably will
receive a pension.

questioned a little the police were. rather
surprised when Larsen admitted he had

a garbled story as to why the boat's .re

I am afraid the experiments will not be con
clusive, as his balloon will always be at the
mercy of the wind, which Is not the kind of
air ship we have dreamed of.
This time It is not the fault of the motor
which worked admirably. It was the balloon
Â¦which caused the accident. I rounded the
Eiffel Tower with admirable speed, as I had a
favorable wind, and was already returning
over the Bois de Boulogne when the wind
freshened suddenly and struck me sidewise.
like a shin in a storm. The balloon pitched
and rolled, now and then recovering its" normal
position. Another sudden veering of the wind
caased the front of the balloon to pitch down
wards and the ropes connectinc it with the
frame caueht in the propeller, which struck
the balloon wires. They broke. I saw the
dangrer and my only thought, was to descend as
quickly as possible. This I was doing suc
cessfully, but I was driven by a contrary wind
in the direction of the Eiffel Tower. Again the.
breeze veered -and thre-w me aeainst a build
ing. The balloon burst like a toy gas balloon v
and the fragments fell, completely covering
me. - The rest you know. I am unhurt I have
not a scratch and will soon recommence. The
motor is uninjured, si. have worked it for 10
minutes. I will now send it to St. Cloud and
set to work " reDairtng the- balloon. It Is sim
ply a matter of sewing the pieces together.
The cause of the accident was that the bal
loon was insufficiently filled. I knew this. The
ven,tilator,also worked. ba4JjVi. .Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ â¢.-Â¦;Â£'Â¦
M. Deutsch. who '," was "present at the
start, in. an interview said :.- -
Santos-Dumont gave the following ac
count of Ms trip:
Explained by Santos-Dumont.
As M. Santos-Dumont superintended the
removal of the machine he said- he was
quite ready to recommence operations.
M. Deutsch. who offered the prize of
100,000 francs for the rounding of Eiffel
Towor and the return to the starting point
within a given period of time, was so
affected by the- danger that Dumont
passed through that he told him he would
rather present him with the prize at once
than to see him kill himself with his ex
periments, but the balloonist replied that
he had rounded Eiffel Tower in -such a
short time that he considered the. result
too satisfactory to permit the relinquisn
ment of his attempts in the future.
As it -was, the aeronaut hung in a mo3t
dangerous -position in midair tor- half an
hour, until by a great eifort he succeeded
in catching the iron bar of a window, to
which he clung until rescued 'with some
difficulty by the use of ropes. The bal
loonist escaped without a scratch, how
ever. Â¦ Â¦ ' ' .: Â¦ '
The 'explosion of the balloon attracted
enormous crowds, and the reception oÂ£
M. Santos-Dumont \ upon reaching the
street was most enthusiastic, many ladies
clinging to his neck and kissing him re
peatedly.
Narrow Escape of the Aeronaut.
PARIS, Aug. 8.â Santos-Dumont started
for the Pare St. Cloud at 6:30 a. m. amid
hearty cheers. His Initial movements
were favorable', as j the balloon turned
around the Eiffel Tower 9 minutes and 30
seconds after starting.' Just over the
Avenue Henri Marien, however, a strong
gust of wind struck the aerostat; which
wavered violently " ; to . one side, almost
simultaneously bounding backward' a dis
tance of "fifty yards. The > hydrogen gas
was forced from the '"front '-to the back
part of the . balloon, ' creating a sudden
expansion, which caused the machine to
dip. Her screw touched the steel cords
and broke them. M. Santos-Dumont' im
mediately stopped, the 'motor and the bal
loon began' to descend.- Unfortunately,
the cover of the aerostat struck the cor
ner of a six-story, building. A report like
a shot from a cannon followed. The bal
loon collapsed and: fell rapidly. Luckily
the frame caught on the coping of the
building and the balloon remained sus
pended, otherwise Santos-Dumont wouid
have been lulled.

Guerrillas Raiding Towns.
NEW YORK, Aug. 8.â F. A. Drake, sec
retary of the Panama Railway Company,
said to-day that the communication which
J. Edward Simmons, president of the
company, sent to the State Department,
expressing apprehension of trouble along
the isthmus of Panama, and suggesting
that an American warship go to the Pa
cific side at Panama, as well as to the
yard, was wrecked. ' Those killed or in
jured were in or near the shed at the time
of the storm.'
Atlantic side at Colon, was sent largely
as the result of the pressure which resi
dents of the isthmus of various nationali
ties have brought to bear on the com
pany.
Since Wednesday night officers of the
company in New York have received mail
advices from the isthmus showing in
creased activity on the part of the insur
gents m the shape of depredations by
bands of from forty to fifty guerrillas. As
yet these guerrillas have no organiza
tion. They nave raided outlying towns in
the neighborhood of stations of the rail
road, such as Bohio and Gatun, looting
property and capturing citizens for ran
som. The largest body of them is near
Chorrera and the Government force there
is said to be not strong enough to leave
the town.
The company's superintendent has not
reported the destruction of any of- its
property, and the uneasiness felt In this
city is due rather to the statement of the
United States Consul General and to pri
vate citizens.
â¢Traffic, however, even in the absence of
any reported depredations along the rail
road line, is clearly tending. In the opin
ion of the officers, to become unsafe, and
the significance of the movements of the
rebels, they think, is .that they appear
to be a revival of the insurrection that
was supposed to have been suppressed
last year.

An interesting point arises in the case
of the ship Empire, which was burned at
Mahukona on July 26. She was from
Newcastle, Australia, with coal, and last
"Wednesday- was considered such a poor
risk that the underwriters were paying
CO per cent to reinsure her. While the

the cargo caught lire and she was burned.
The news "of the disaster appeared exclu

that brings up the question of reinsur

two days later was destroyed. Do the

ING LABOR MASS MEETING
IN METROPOLITAN HALL.
I The average man believes he is justified
in, stealing, an -umbrella or. a kiss when
ever "he has a chance.
.For the first time since the inception of
the strike the city government felt its
effects yesterday. : Five teanftters quit
work at the Corporation Yard. There are
fifty men employed in the repair depart
ment and they were allowed to remain at
work. Permission was given by the
unions to owners of teams to do the
necessary hauling.' In case the men doing
work for the municipality are called out
there -will be more than seventy-five af
fected. -Â¦Â¦.- i 'â¢â¢ "â¢Â¦
Strike Affects City Employes.
.The Master Painters have settled" down
to a' long siege with-the striking journey
men. The bosses are looking for men at
the old scale of- wagesâ $3 a day for eight
hours. The Building Trades "Council has
not yet taken a hand in this contest.
OAKLAND, Aug. 8.â The union team
sters employed by coal and lumber deal
ers in this city have notified their em-,
ployers that they will strike if at
tempt is made to handle lumber or coal
cargoes at this port with non-union men.
Union longshoremen who had been work
ing for the I Humboldt Lumber Company
were called out this morning because they
had begun to handle lumber from the
steamer Mandalay, which was discharged
a few days ago by non-unionists.
Stocks of lumber and coal are running
low in this city. .
The ship Highland Light, coal laden, is
tied up at the Howard Company's bunk
ers because the hoisting engineers are on
strike. Barnes P. Taylor has been, noti
fied that hi3 union teamsters' will strike

The Strike in Oakland.
Two Seasons for Temperance. :
I do not ask you to the pledge, but I
would advise you to be 'more temperate now
than ever in the liquor' that you are accus
tomed to take, and that for two reasons: It
means bread for your families, and In the sec
ond place it means self-control, and you want
self-control now if never you wanted it be
fore. You can't hire men to be teetotalers for.
you you can't afford to hire men to stay up
air night and work for you and you can't
afford to hire brains; your employers can. They
can pay for men to talk for them; you can't
do it. Therefore you must look to yourselves,
you must be sober yourselves, you must prac
tice self-restraint for yourselves and you must
think for yourselves; and, above all, you must
remember that a strike is not a time of idle
ness; if you can't work for your employer you
must work for yourselves. You are going about
it in the right way. If you can put your case
before the people of this State they win Be e
that it la their own case. How many employ
ers are there In the whole State? How many
of the employed? A handful of the one, a
great ocean of the other. The cause of one
worker is the cause of other workers.
I have come here to deliver my soul; I have
said my say. I believe in the cause of the
worklngman, I belie\-e in a fair wage, I be
lieve In fair hours. I believe in one rest day
in the seven. I believe in enforcing these
things by unionism. I believe In putting them
Into the law whenever you can, and I believe
that these things are at stake in this city to
day: that it is not a question of wages or of
hours, it is not a question of teamsters or
longshoremen, it is not a question whether you
haul this freight or whether that steamer will
go to sea. It is the great nuestlon. Shall men
for -whom Christ died to teach them that their
souls are their own. that they ait free men
with free men's rights, be crushed Beneath the
foot of the meanest of all the angela that fell
from heaven, Mammon, the spirit of greed?
Let me echo the words of the last speaker:
Above all things be law-abiding. There is in
this city, as there is in every other city in
the world, a hoodlum element; an element that
never dees an honest day's work; an element
that will be always around where there Is a
crowd, and that will be delighted when there
is a row. And if the workingmen give any pre
text, or whether they give any pretext or not,
if there is a hoodlum gathering and row down
on Mission street or on the water front the
fact will go into the newspapers as a riot
by worklngmen. It Is an old trick. A man
goes out In the outskirts and some men jump
on him", and he say* he can't recognize them,
but he know3 they are strikers. You must be
prepared to look out for these things in the
papers, andayou must give no opportunity to
the employers or to the conservative people of
the town to- hold you really guilty of any act
against -the naw. It is very hard, I know;
blocd may boil within you and your hands
may twitch, but remember In silence and in
repose shall be your strength. The man wins
who knows how to wait. (Applause.) There
fore abstain from quarrels, especially quarrels
of the tongue, whioh is an unruly member and
gets men into all kinds of trouble. Men begin
by calling names and soon end In blows.
Be Law-Abiding 1 .
The fourth thins that is necessary for you
to do is to keep your eyes on the newspapers.
(Applause.) The newspapers have still a great
power of making public opinion. They may
not have so much power of making public opin
ion in their editorial column as they have of
making it In their news columns. They can
color the news to suit themselves. Therefore
watch your newspapers; and you have reason
for It. The men you are fighting against will
not flsht fair. Only the other day a deputa
tion of them went to the chief papers of this
city and demanded, because they were big ad
vertisers, that the newspapers should In tho
first place take the news of the strike off
their front page, the place of honor, and put it
into the back of the paper, and gradually be
gin to cut it down column by column until the
people of this city would have the idea that the
strike was petering out. I have that on the
authority of a man who has the confidence of
you all, and who has given me permission to
make use of it. and I know, if I had never
heard of it, on such authority, I know it is
what they always do. The advertisers of
course give good money to the newspapers, but
they get as much from the newspapers as they
give. The man who thinks that money for
advertising: is merely charity money under an
other guise is twenty-six different kinds of a
fool. Advertising Is valuable, and when these
merchants pay for their advertising they get
from the newspapers fair value for their money
and they have no right to demand anything
more. â¢ Moreover, the value of advertising de
pends upon the number of people it reaches.
If a newspaper does not give you the news
that you pay your nickel for get another.
"Watch the Newspapers.
gether you are bound to win in the long run.
(Applause.) Don't be too critical now at the
time when the war is on. Remember that the
settlement of this matter does not rest with
you, and it does not rest with your employ
ers; it rests with the people of this city. You
are not dealing .with men who are distributors
of what they manufacture, Â¦ but what they re
ceive from elsewhere. They do ' not produce,
but they receive from elsewhere and distribute
to other3. They distribute to your wives, they
distribute to your relatives and your friends;
they distribute to the people of this city, and
therefore it Is the people of this city, of this
State and of it3 contiguous territory that will
have the say as to whether they shall be allow
ed to tie up the commerce of this town for an
indefinite time. (Applause.) If you can or
ganize the common people your cause Is won.

John Franton, a non-union stevedore,
was attacked by a crowd of strikers on
Market street, near East, at a late hour
last night. Before he could receive ma
terial injuries he was rescued by Ser
geant Blank and Officer Callaghan, who
were attracted to the scene by the sounds
of the scuffling. By the aid of their clubs
the officers dispersed the crowd, and
James Donahue, a sailor, was taken pris
oner. His wounds were dressed at the
Harbor Hospital, after which he was
booked on a charge, of disturbing- the
police.
Strikers Attack a Stevedore.
There was also a rumor circulated at
the meeting to the effect that the Horse
shoers' Union would also place strike
power In the hands of its executive com
mittee. It was stated that the executive
committee hopes by calling out the unions
upon which the teamsters depend for
their supplies to render the strike more
stringent.
Althoug-h the carriage blacksmiths have
placed strike power in the han'ds of their
executive committee, the members do not
expect to be ordered out on a strike. The
membership of the union embraces about
125 blacksmiths.
The Carriage Blacksmiths' Union No. 99
held a meeting last night at Turk-street
Temple and placed strike power in the
hands of its executive committee. This
action was taken in accordance with the
request which the executive committee of
the Labor Council issued at a recent
meeting;. The request was to the effect
that unions should hold meetings as soon
as possible and place full power to act
In the hands of their several executive
comm'ttees, which are to be directed
when to act by the executive' committee
of the Labor Council.
Place Strike Power in Hands of Ex
ecutive Committee.
BLACKSMITHS MAY GO OUT.
.How are you" going to enforce these rights?

in vogue In San Francisco to-day, namely, that
it is the right of the employer to get what he
can out of . the employe for the lowest wages,
what limit is there to his . right. ' what guar
antee that he will not force the laborer to work

was freedom itself. - .
Just Price for Labor.
The price of labor Is not determined in the
open market and* with unlimited competition.
There Is such a thing as a just price; there is
such a thing aa a fair price. If I go Into a store
to buy some article and the man that keeps tho
store presumes upon my Inexperience In com
merce and charges me more than the current
price for the article, do you not say, that he
Is a fraud and a thief? Will any honorable
man. do such a thing? If a man goes into a
store and tries to Impose upon the inexperience
of a salesman to get an article for half what
It is worth is not such a man a thief also?
What is the difference when it Is wages that
are sold? What Is the difference when wages
are the price of labor? The man who tries . by
competition or by throwing ,dust in your eyes
or by any other means to get your work for
less than it is worth commits a great sin, for
he defrauds the laborer of his hire. (Ap
plause.) . Â¦ . Â¦
stance of the decision, which seems to me to
be. merely a question of words, but I wish to
call your attention to the reasoning which
preceded the substance of the decision. If you
take the trouble to wade through the columns
of the newspaper 1 in which that decision was
given out you will find that the learned judge
laid it down as a theory that the present con
dition of labor arises from these two princi
ples: First, that the employer tries to get as
much as he can out of the laborer for as little
as poaslble; and, secondly, that the laborer
tries to get as much out of the employer for as
little work as , possible. He lays down this
principle not as a matter of factâ and as a
matter of fact perhaps it may be true â but
he lays It down as a matter of philosophy, as
a matter to decide what wages are to be earned
and what the value may be of a. man's time,
and he says that the condition of the working
man is to be decided by this, that It Is right
for the employer to try. to make him sell his
labor In the open market at the smallest price
that he can get it for. I say. that such a doc
trine as that . is un-Chrlstian and it is un
natural. (Great applause.)
The Conflict Not New.
This conflict between labor and capital is not
confined to any country or to any time. It has
been fought out before. It has been carefully
studied, and there is absolutely nothing new In
it. The merchants have no new grievances,
and the workingmen have developed no new
form of crankiness to put them upon their met
tle.- - Â¦.-Â¦ Â¦ â¢ - <. â¢ .Â¦ Â¦.-, :
I wish to call your attention in the most re
spectful way that I can to a decision that was
delivered by one of the higher courts of this
city on this question of labor and capital with
in the last week or so. It is our duty to speak
well of and respect the constituted authorities,
and especially in a country I like i this that | is
ruled by law It -is neceseary to speak respect
fully of those who are the interpreters of the
law. of the Judges upon the bench. Therefore
In speaking, of the decision given by Judge
Sloss I wish to speak as respectfully .'as possi
ble of him In his official' capacity. .'.','
I have nothing to say with regard to the sub-
The Rev. P. C. Yorke delivered the chief
address of the meeting. He spoke, for
more than an hour and frequently aroused
the audience to frenzied applause. He
said in Dart: Â¥
I have spoken many times In this hall, but
never with such reluctance and with such a
sense of responsibility -as this night. We are
face to face with n. great crisis. The question
bÂ«twppn the employers and the employes is no
longer a question of hours or wages; it is a
question of unions. Have the men a right to
combine In unions? Have such unions a right
to treat with employers on the condition of
the employed? â¢ . .
A strike Is a war. It Is a last resource. Like
every other war It entails suffering. Both sides
suffer. But the burdens perhaps fall heaviest
upon the innocent third parties that are caught,
between the upper and nether millstones. I
cannot forget the women and the children,
therefore it is with reluctance ana with a
sense of responsibility that exceeds any words
that I can find for it that I speak here to-night.
I should . not like â¢ to be the man that would
stand In the way of an amicable arrangement
between the forces of capital and labor. I
should not like to say a word that would make
such an arrangement more difficult now or In
the future. But at the same time he would be
no friend of labor, he would be no real friend
of capital, he would do no good to this city
and to this State who would conceal the I real
issues that face you. who would not warn you
that while you desire peace you cannot
afford to accept any peace but peace with
honor. (Great applause.)
My purpose this evening is not to Indulge In
oratory or in exhortation. When men are In
earnest, when the matter before them is of
supreme Importance, Â¦ even as this matter, ex
hortatlcns are useless. I want to put before
you, and I want to put before the larger,'au
dience of this city and of this State as clearly
as I know how about how this question stands.
To that end I will speak to you, with your
permission, to-night, first on the question of
the rights and duties of labor in general; sec
ondly, on tBe nature of the present crisis; and
thirdly, on your duty in the premises.
Father Yorke's Address.
Industrial democracy Is developing along the
same lines that political â¢ democracy developed
In England. When the King would not listen
to petitions Parliament stopped supplies. So
when the industrial plutocracy refuses to hear
petitions, to redress grievances, it Is the right
of the people to stop supplies.
Let me close by saying to the Employers'
Association that I am satisfied that if three
of their number would meet three of us, with
some trusted citizen as a seventh, our differ
ences could be adjusted without trouble.
Lester Reeves sang a barytone solo,
"Strike for Justice."
They say the unions are not reliable and
they will not keep contracts. Contracts are
made under certain conditions. There was a
contract between Spain and the United States,
a treaty of peace and amity. Yet a time came
when the United States felt Jt had a right to
ebrogate that treaty and go to the aid of
suffering Cuba. In the same way it was right
for the Sailors' Union to break a contract, it
was right for the Firemen's Union to break
a contract. We looked at It In this way: On
the one hand was the permanent welfare of
workingmen, on the other a temporary con
tract. To my mind there is no question where
duty lay. . I am not sorry those contracts were
broken. I am satisfied those unions would take
the same stand over again to-morrow under
the same conditions.- Â¦
Why Contracts Were Broken.
What do we want? We want recognition of
our unions. Their unions are already recog
nized. We want opportunity to help each
other. They stand for the proposition "You
must not help each other mutually. You must
not bear each other's burdens." We stand for
the proposition, "We must help each other
mutually. We must bear each other's bur
dens." . .
employ Dick, or Harry." I never knew a
union to do that. We want to have an oppor
tunity, to organize and if employers have griev
ances that cannot be adjusted we want to havo
representatives who can go to the employer
and seek to reach agreement.
The third matter which concerns the present
crisis Is the attitude of the civil power. It
Is against the fundamental principles of our
Institutions to suppose that any man is guilty
of crime before there be some acts or some
evidence to ehuw that he has committed it or
that he. intends to commit it. â¢. Who are pro
tected in this town to-night? -Who pays the
taxes of this community? Is it the rich mer

who pay the Mayor; It Is -you who pay the
police. I say that it is a crying shame thnt
while the workingmen have been orderly, while
you will find columns about shooting and out

papers and of shooting this and of shooting

I wish to go now to the third part of this
speech, that ia to say, what is your fluty "In t.'ie
present j circumstances. In ' the first placÂ«s let
me say that His my conviction, and I believe
it is the conviction ; of a 'vast majority of the
people of this city, that your quarrel is just
(applauBe).. that this -thing . hae been forced
upon you, and that what is at the bottom of It
is not a desire to resist ' injustice or Inter
ference, but that it is the desire to so cripple
, and hurt the unions that the employers may
do what th-iy please in the days to come. They
are willing to suffer a little now In order that

Is to Â¦ stick : together. - If you : don't hany â¢to

Guardian Angels of Draymen.
The second point which the employers try to
make In this controversy Is that they will not
deal with the union directly; they will deal
with their Individual employes. If John Brown
or Tom Robinson has a grievance against the
firm let him come up and make his complaint
and the firm will attend to it, but we will
not have anything to do with walking dele
gates or secretaries or anybody else; we will
not recognize the union, and we will not let it
como between the -wind and our nobllltv: the
union must have nothing at all to do with us.
This Is perhaps the most fundamental point in
the contention. If the men can't form a cor
porate body and if they can't appoint their
deputies to speak for them to any employer
whatsoever then they might as well give up
and bury their- unions. What is the good of
a union? The good of a union Is in Its
strength, in tha_t a large number of men are
bound together, and where there is unity there
Is strerieth. The employer who will turn . his
back ucon one man will think ten times be
fore he will offend five hundred.
Strength Is in Unity.
I wish now to take un the second part of
what I Â¦ am going to say, and that is to deal
with the present crisis here In San Francisco.
The most efficacious cry that has been made
against you, the most taking warcry that the
other side has set up is this: That they havs
a right to run their own business as they
please. No man likes to be interfered with. I
say that no man has a right to run his busi
ness as he pleases. There was oply one man
who could run his business as he pleased and
do as he pleased, and he couldn't do it for
long, and that was Adam before Eve was
created (laughter and applause). No man has
perfect liberty except a man who is free from
all human companionship. If I should go to
live on the top of a mountain where nobody
could come near me I would have perfect lib
erty to do as I pleased; I might wear anything
or nothing. I might stand on my head or shoot
oft firecrackers, or I might carry concealed
weapons without a permit (great laughter and
applause), but the minute I go to live in so
ciety I begin to give up some portion of my
liberty. I can't do just as I please: I must
think of what, my neighbor pleases and how he
will look uj>on my carrying-ons. There is no
more Influential portion of this community, and
deservedly so, than the lawyers. Can the law
yers always run their ,own business as they
please? Let a lawyer try to run his law of flee
as he pleases and he will have the Supreme
Court down* on him like a thousand of bricks.
Ho is bound hand and foot by laws, he is
bound by precedents, he is bound by the de
cree of the court, he is bound by the wishes
of his clients, and Instead -of managing his
cases as he pleases he has to walk a very nar
row chalk line when he goes to court.
The Present Crisis.
right of , trial by Jury was gained. If these
rights that I have spoken of are to be gained
they are to be gained In the first place only
by the association of workingmen, and second
ly, when the time is ripe, by making them the
law of the land. It seems to me that Is the
difference between the employes to-day and
the Employers" Association. Have working
men a right to form unions? Have they a
right to band together so that they may be
able to enforce their rights ? Have these unions
the right to speak for the whole body? I do
not wish to dwell upon this point; I wish sim
ply to say that it Is the word of the Pope
himself that such matters as deal with the
benefit of the worklnsrmen come pronerly and
rightly within the sphere . of the law, and in
this country it depends upon the worklngman
entirely as to how soon the law will take
effect.
Little progress is being made in the task
cf unloading the collier Tellus. Two full
pangs are at work, but they are all com
posed of new men, and in consequence
take out but little coal during a day. Yes
terday morning East street was filled
with coal carts sent to the Dunsmuir
bunkers by retailers from various por
tions of the town for a supply of coal.
The collier Milton, which has been un
loading into barges for several days past,
is almost empty. When she is completely
discharged the Czarina and Che South
Portland will be moved out Into the
stream and unloaded by the same means.
Lack of a sufficient number of barges Is
proving a serious handicap to the coal
men.
The Aconcagua was unable to clear for
Chile yesterday, though her owners confi
dently expected she would. Considerable
cargo yet remains on the /dock to be
placed aboard.
Captain Howard of the Mariposa said
yesterday that he would get his vessel
away Saturday. The longshoremen em
ployed on the Pacific-street dock are
handling all the freight that is being land
ed on the dock for the Mariposa in a
rapid manner.
At the Mail dock large gangs of men
are at work. The loading of the America
Maru is so far advanced that she will be
able to sail to-morrow with a full cargo.
A considerable portion of the cargo of
the City of Sydney is still aboard, that
ve-EEel and she will not be ready to sail
for several days. There was no room on
the Mail dock for the Acapulco, which ar
rived yesterday from Panama and way
ports, and she was anchored in the
stream. No attempt will be made to un
load her until the Mail dock is cleared of
fre'jht.
The Belgian King from Hongkong, via
San Diego, arrived here yesterday. She
will be sent to Lombard-street wharf to
unload.
A complete non-union crew, shipped at
Eureka, brought the Pomona into port
yesterday morning. A short time after
ehe arrived she went to Baden, where she
will land her cargo of livestock.
The gasoline launch Snug was hailed by
union pickets yesterday while on her way
from the Ohio to th<; collier Milton with
a boatload of non-union men. The non
union men called the pickets all sorts of
vile names and for a time a battle Â¦was
imminent. The pickets, however, were
armed, and when they displayed their pis
tols the non-union men stopped hurling
abuse at them and urged the launch own
er to go ahead full speed.
The British steamer Imogen from Ja
pan, seventeen days out and loaded with
ballast, and the British bark Dovenby,
also in ballast, were added to the fleet of
tJed-up vessels yesterday. When released
they will be towed to Port Costa and
loaded with wheat.
The Anubis is tied up at the seawall,
receiving the rest of her cargo. She came
down from Port Costa, yesterday, where
2000 tons of wheat and barley had been
put aboard her. She is scheduled to sail
August 13, and will probably get away on
time.
The steamer Columbia is at last fully
leaded and will sail to-day.
Little was done on the water front yes
terday toward relieving the harbor of the
congestion of freight and shipping. Men
Â¦were at work on all the wharves and it
â¢was reported that several vessels were
ready to put to sea, but the Umatilla was
the only large ship to leave the port. Sev
eral schooners cleared for coast ports and
a number of others came in, leaving- the
conditions on the water front practically
unchanged.

Trade unionism 1s an outcome, a sequence,' of
the divine injunction. "Bear ye one another's
burden." When that injunction was given the
world was a world of masters and slaves. The
toller was not supposed to have a soul to save.
As that Injunction percolated down through the
ages It began to find its way into the brains
and hearts of men, until they began to be

Then a time came when men asked if there

Andrew Furueeth. secretary of the Sail
ors' Union, was Introduced. He said in
part: -
Genesis of Trades "Onions.
I wish it were possible for one side or the
other so to make concessions or . so to meet
them that we may have peace. So I believe
the side which shall make concessions will play
the manly and magnanimous part.
We all have rights, but we must all make
concessions sometimes. We all have liberties,
but how about the other fellow? So the cry of
our city and of our State is peace, and I be
lieve It Is your cry. This question will have
to be settled by botlj sides making concessions.
The thins: for all to do is to play the part of
a man. The solution is in the golden rule and
not In the iron rule. In the gospel of human
brotherhood, in the doctrine that will teach
the employer to look upon the toller as a fel
low man. As long as we play at the see
saw gameâ when capital is up labor is down,
when labor is up capital is, down â we shall not
make progress. Let law step in and provide
for the arbitration of labor questions, with
each side compelled to abide by the results.
Some tell me that this is a battle against
unions. We all know that greed has organized
gigantic trusts and monopoly, that it has defied
law and has dictate* to producer and con
sumer alike. I cannot conceive any law that
would prohibit the sons of toll from organizing
for their own protection and profit. Liberty
is our inalienable right, and as lontr as trusts
are allowed to go in their course I believe it
Is absolutely necessary for workingmen and
Email manufacturers, too, to organize for self
protection.
The cry of the oppressed or of those who
think they are oppressed is the cry of the
ages. The industrial question lays every other
social question in the shade. The strike la
a warning. It Is like the skirmish that comes
before the battle. Many who ought to assist
in the solution of these problems are so wrap
ped up in their own selfishness as to be utterly
indifferent to these terribly dark shadows.
. I am not here for any other purpose^ than to
speak a word for peace. I wish it were pos
sible to stop this struggle, and I trust It is
the wish of every honest son of toil that it
might stop speedily. I wish it were possible
for fiome N'ehemiah to come forth and by sim

The Rev. Frank K. Baker, pastor of the
First Methodist Episcopal Church, was
the first speaker. He said in part:
Bev. Frank K." Baker Speaks.
Everything that human beings are capable
of has been done to prevent the present crisis.
Everything possible is still being done to pre
vent further suffering on the part of Innocent
and Involuntary participants. We fully appre
ciate the hardships of the women and children
and the business inconvenience to all concern
ed In the city, throughout the State and along
the Coast. But no amelioration of these con
ditions seems to us possible except by a set
tlement of the issues involved. We are doing
our best peaceably, yet firmly, to bring about
that settlement, and we now submit our case
to you and earnestly urge that the great
hearted public will lend a hand toward a set
tlement that will mean victory for decency,
right and public progress.
The Employers* Association persistently tries
to befog the issue. It declares that it is per
fectly willing to grant the workers the right
to belong to a labor organization.' The trade
unions repudiate this assumption of magna
nimity. The right of the workers to organize
for industrial progress has long been granted
by all civilized countries. That right is the
inalienable heritage of the present generation,
won by the labors. and sacrifices of the work
ers in all times.
The labor organizations, after striving vainly
for months to secure by conference and conces
sion a recognition of their claims for decent
consideration on the part of their employers,
have been driven to the necessity of taking
steps for the defense of the principle of trade
unionism itself.
The conflict now in progress in San Francisco
Is between the workers organized in the trade
unions and acting unitedly under the direction
of the Labor Council, the City Front Federa
tion and other representative bodies, and the
Employers' Association, composed no one knows
of whom and acting by stealth for the ac
complishment of objects which can only be
judged by inference. " â¢
We are now gathered for the purpose of giv
ing: publicity to the labor side of the present
crisis in the industrial affairs of our city.
We have nothing to fear from publicity. A
good cause always courts the light of day.
Only those who would break into the houses
or transgress the rights of others need fear
the public gaze.
Promptly at 8 o'clock W. H. Goff, presi
dent of the San Francisco Labor Council,
introduced Walter Macarthur. editor of
the Coast Seamen's Journal, as the pre
siding officer of the evening. Mr. Mac
arthur gave a preliminary talk, in part as
follows:
Light of Day Courted.
As favorite labor leaders came upon the
platform they were received with deafen
ing cheers. Andrew Furuseth,, Michael
Casey and W. H. Goff were given warm
welcome. Father Yorke entered late,
after the meeting had been called to or
der, and the audience greeted him with a
storm of applause that lasted nearly live
minutes and made the chandeliers shake.
Metropolitan Temple was packed to its
doors at 7:30 o'clock. More than 500 peo
ple found room after every seat was
taken. Thousands were turned away and
went home in disappointment.
The mass-meeting was a great rally of
the strike forces. The audience was re
markable for the small number of women
present. Apparently by common impulse
the wives and daughters remained away
in order that so many more of the men
who are fighting labor's battle might at
tend and receive encouragement to con
tinue the struggle.
filled the hall. The gospel of hu
man brotherhood was preached to them
with the earnestness that convinces and
the justice of their cause was asserted
from the platform with fervid eloquence.
LABOR had its inning at Metropol
itan Temple last night. A great
body of workingmen, every one
of whom knew what toil means.
A conference at Mayor Phelan's office at
4 o'clock was the result of a request by
the Mayor. Michael Ca6ey, T. Westoby,
Hugh McKevitt, Charles Kelly and J. C.
Christianson were present as representa
tives of the unions. The purpose was to
discuss the strike situation and to con
sider methods of preserving the peace.
The grain merchants are endeavoring to
get gome sort of a concession by which
stevedores will be allowed to unload grain
barges and to load grain ships at Port

farmers will suffer great loss, although
entirely innocent of any offense against
organized labor.
Among the films represented were Bal

of the unions were Edward Rosenberg,
secretary of the Labor Council, and Hugh

executive committee, which, in
ordering them to go out on strike,
stipulated that, the men engaged
in hauling street sweepings and the
drivers of sprinkling wagons should be
allowed to remain at work, caused more
than 300 men to join the idle crowd yes
terday. Its action also prevents the con
tractors from keeping the streets clean
and exposes the residents of this city to
the dangers that lurk in an accumulation
of filth and dirt.
The executive committee of the union,
in ordering out the sand teamsters and
excepting the men who worked with the
street cleaning 1 contractors, expected that
its action would meet with the approval
of the union, but its decision was re
versed. The members claimed that every
member of the union should go out,
despite the hardships It might cause.
There are about forty drivers of dirt
wagons and street sprinklers employed
by the contractors, and when they re
fused to go to work yesterday morning
the contractors were compelled to send
their entire force of street sweepers back
to their homes.
Great Indignation was expressed by the
contractors when they were informed of
the action of the union. They said that
last 'March a contract was signed by them
and the teamsters which was meant to
prevent just such action. "They have de
liberately broken that agreement," say
the contractors, "and have destroyed the
faith we had in the fairness of labor
unions."

Merchants "Will Endeavor to Effect

The retail dealers In almost every line
of merchandise in which business has
been affected by the existing labor dis
sensions held a meeting last night in the
assembly hall of the Parrott building for
the purpose of devising a mode of con
ciliating the strikers and their employers.
The meeting was purely preliminary. An
organization was accomplished and plans
were discussed, but nothing definite was
done further than the issuance of a call
for another meeting, to be held next Mon
day night.
It was decided to have every retail or
ganization in the city represented at the
next meeting. The following committee
was appointed to arouse Interest among
the retail societies: W. J. Kenny, chair
man; James K. Taylor, secretary; J. \v

Flageollet, Joe Halle. Chris Hartmann'
J. Kames. John McCafferty, E. L. Bar

Besides inducing retail associations to
send delegations to the Monday meeting
the committee will endeavor to have
all lines of retail, merchants represented
whether they are organized or not. At
the meeting the strike situation will be
fully canvassed and an earnest effort will
be made to devise a means of ending the
labor troubles.
Warrants Issued for Strikers.
Warrants are being Issued daily for the
arrest of strikers or non-union men for
battery and other misdemeanors, and the
Judges will soon have very little else to
do* except to try these cases. Yesterday
several warrants were Issued.
J. L. Golden, a non-union teamster em

reopen the Painter mill.
At Newcastle to-night the Rosana and
Raney furnaces were shut down, leaving
600 men without employment. The order
directed that furnaces be blown out,
which means a long shutdown. ;
President Gompers said to-night:
"1 cannot say anything for publication
at present. I shall be glad to see any of
the press reporters when 'the time comes
to speak, but in the meantime I cannot
discuss ihese matters. I expect to remain
in Pittsburg to-morrow and will hold
another conference with Shaffer during
the day. When we have reached a con
clusion I will call you all in and give you
our decision."
A heavy guard of special officers has
been put on for the protection of the
workmen. The strike leaders plan a
series cf rallies for Saturday, the closing
day of the preliminary campaign. The
largest will be held at Cascade Park,
Newcastle, and its managers claim that
25.OU0 workincmen will participate in it.
Special trains will be run from New
Brighton, Sharon, Sharpsville and other
adjoining towns. The affair is to bp a
picnic. lasting all day. President Shaffer
and other Amalgamated leaders and
President Gompers will deliver addresses.
There will be another (gathering at Mc-
Kees Rocks, and night demonstrations at
Monessen and McKee?rÂ»ort.

The first act of violence in this ncigh
boorhood occurred at Natrona last night
when a foreigner whose name could not
be learned was shot, presumably by strik
ers. He was employed in thr; copper ex
traction department of the Pennsylvania
Salt Manufacturing Company and was
struck by shot in three places, but not
seriously Injured. Six or eight shots were
rirec from the hill back of the works
The company has succeeded in filling the
striking furnace men's places, and thÂ«Â»
strikers are trying to frighten the new
men away by throwing rocks and shoot
ing at them while at work.
The steel corporation succeeded to-day
in getting the farm mill at the Lindsay &
McCutcheon plant and another mill at 'the
Clark works ir. operation. They also re
ceived reports that at Hyde PaiÂ»k last
night four of the mills did perfect work,
and an announcement from Wellsville
that the strike was virtually over there.
They met with no oposition at any of the
four points wnere they have reopened
mills, and expressed their satisfaction at
the progress made. The strikers insist
that there arec not enough men at the
Lindsay & McCutcheon mill this morning
to operate the one mill started, and pre
dicted that it would close down during
the day. It w.is kept going, however, un

.The firemen made gallant efforts to
reach him with their longest ladders, but
the flames and smoke came out of the
intermediate windows with such intensity
that the attempt had . to be abandoned.
There were tarpaulins available, but ow
ing to a mistake these were not ready
for use. The unfortunate man ; was seen

to the unspeakable distress of those who
were watching and powerless to assist, lie
leaped through the - intervening fire and
smoke into Gipps street and was mangled
on the pavement before the crowd. He
died before he reached the hospital.
"Four men, William Dashwood, Waiter

were reported missing during the fire and
it was afterward found that all. had been
burned to death.
5 Leaping across these lanes, the con
flagration attacked the other buildings
almost simultaneously, getting into the
Pitt-street corner block at about the
third story from the ground. This Im
mense place was quadrangular and seven
stories high, being surmounted by a con
spicuous square tower. Once the fire
had got hold of the third story it spread
so rapidly and filled the place with such
volumes of smoke that the employes
there decided on immediate flight. Those
on the lower three stories had a good
chance of getting away, but men on the
four higher floors had the utmost diffi
culty in descending, being desperately
scorched and almost overpowered with the
reek.' Four were unable to escape.

in the big store, the others not having
arrived. Smoke was seen coming from a
cellar where woolen goods were stored
and before anything could be done to in

Jackson went north and rapidly went
into decline. He returned a wan, hollow
cheeked wreck. He wanted to die among
his friends in Australia, and he /was sent
home to end his days under the southern
cross. â¢
He barely lasted the first round. In the
second Jeffries looked. appealingly at the
referee, as if to ask him to ston the con
test and spare him from inflicting un
necessary punishment on, his game oppo
nent. Jackson had : of ten been merciful
under like conditions to his adversaries,
but- this was the first time in his long
career when he needed mercy extended
to him. The fight ended in the second
round.
Â¦Peter Jackson was one of the most pop
ular men that ever entered a ring. As a
boxer he had few equals and in his prime
was practically unbeatable. He arrived
in this city in 1888,- and was then the
picture of an ideal athlete. Tall, lithe,
well proportioned, he attracted the atten
tion of passersby on the street. Although
not well educated he had mingled so much
with men of the world that he had ac
quired a polished manner. He was pos
sessed of a quick wit and was a clever,
well-informed conversationalist. He could
talk on a wide variety of subjects, but
could not be drawn into a discussion of
his own prowess nor was he ever heard
to speak slightingly of an opponent.
He was born on July 3, 1861. in the West
Indies. His early life was spent in Aus
tralia, where he fought for the first. time
in July, 1884. Four years later he came
to this city -unannounced. His first bat
tle in the rooms of the California Ath
letic Club was against George Godfrey,
whom he defeated In nineteen rounds. He
next met Joe McAullfTe, whom he de
feated easily in twenty-four rounds. He
defeated Patsy Cardiff in ten rounds and
then started on a tour to Europe. On t!ie
way he met and defeated a lot of men.
winning usually in two or three rounds.
In Â¦ May, 1S91, he returned to this city
and fought his memorable sixty-one-round
draw with Jim Corbett. Shortly before
the date of the contest Jackson was
thrown from a cart on the San Leandro
road and sustained a badly sprained ankle.
This handicapped him in the fight. Cor
bett was not at his best, so the affair
developed into a long-distance sparring
match. '
" Jackson went back to England and es
tablished a boxing school, which was lib
erally patronized by his admirers. He
tired of this and again visited this city.
Champion Jeffries â¢ was here at the time
and persons who were close to Jackson
arranged a meeting between them. Tho
affair took place in Woodward's Pavilion.
Jackson trained carefully for the bout,
and experts could not detect a flaw in his
condition when he stepped into the ring.
He presented the same rugged appearance
which won the ring followers of a decade
ago. . â¢ .â¢-.','
It took only a moment' to show that
Jackson on that night was only a., shadow
of the once great athlete. His blows
lacked force, and, although he landed left
and right on Jeffries, the blows had no
effect.
The Brisbane papers say that his death
had been expected for some time. -Since
his arrival in Australia he had received
every attention from his former admirers
and- relatives. He 'had >a comfortable
hame at the sanitarium. He was buried
in Brisbane. . â¢Â¦ . - - . -

AUSTRALIAN MILLIONS GO UP,
Rufus- C. Emory, superintendent of the
Arctic Oil Company, was called in behalf
of the Southern Pacific and explained the
prices of different oils and the manner in
which the different varieties are sold. He
found it hard to say just what price Bak
ersfield oil would bring in the market. It
had been offered as low as 65 cents, but
in the opinion of the witness a reduction
of the freight tariff on oil would not nec
essarily increase the consumption. The
cause of the low price of oil was over
production. Another reason was the bit
ter competition among the producers.
Many of . the producers had small tanks,
and when these 'were full they had to sell
or stop producing. When this state of
affairs prevailed the producers sold at
whatever prices were offered, thus demor
alizing- the market.
The witness ventured the opinion that
a reduction of the oil freight tariff would
help the consumer, but not the producer.
Comparative figures were then given at
the recuest of Mr. Herrin. Oil sold at '
$1 25 a barrel would compete with coal
screenings. Oil is about $2 50 as against
from J5 to $6 a ton for coal, the fluid being
worth about one-half the current cost of
coal. In answer to a question by Mr.
Short, the witness said that if the tariff
on oil were to be reduced 10 cents his
company, which is buying oil, would in
sist upon getting the reduction.- If. the
producer refused to allow it, the company
would decline to buy more oil. â¢ - . â¢
W. A. Bissell, traffic manager ' of - the
Santa Fe, was next called and questioned
by Mr. Norton, attorney for the company.
He testified that the rate on oil .was lower
than the tariff rates on hay,- sheep and
cattle. His experience in railroading
taught him that the present rate was a
low one as compared with those on other
commodities charged by other lines in the
country. In Ohio, for example, there was
a rate of 12 cents for 100 pounds. There
was a rate of 15 cents per hundred from
Chicago to the Mississippi River. It was
1538 miles on one road and 237 miles on tho
other road. The rate on 1Q0 pounds from
Bakersfield to this city was 12.9 cents, a
distance of 313 miles.
B. F. Brooks, an oil man of Bakersfield,
was the first witness called after the noon
recess. He said that oil would superseds
coal at about $1 p/Â»r barrel. He did. not
believe that a reduction of the tariff on
oil would benefit the producers under
present conditions. The competition
among oil men was so great that a re
duction of the freight tariff meant a re
duction of the price of oil. The consump
tion of oil was increasing daily. In Ari
zona, especially, the consumption was in
creasing at a great rate. In many places,
notably Chloride, oil had displaced coal
entirely. The witness did not believo the
railway companies could haul oil from the
field to San Francisco at less than the
current rate without loss. /
Edward Chambers, general freight I
3gent of the Santa Fe at Los Angeles,
testified that his company used about 80.
000 barrels of. oil a month on its line. He
deemed 42 cents a barrel a fair rate for
all concerned. As for the rate schedule of
the Santa Fe, the rate on oil was the
lowest of any scheduled by that corpora
tion. Tho witness regarded the switching
charge of $7 as being very reasonable.
Under cross-examination Mr. Chambers
admitted that there was no competition
between his company and the Southern
Pacific in the transportation of oil.
William Sproule, freight traffic manager
of the Southern Pacific, presented statis
tics of rates charged for hauling other
commodities, which tended to show that
the rate on oil was extremely reasonable.
Were it not for the fact that the develop
ment of the oil industry in California
would develop enterprises which must ul
timately add to the revenues of the com
pany, the present rate could never be
maintained.
The inquiry will be resumed at 10 o'clock
this morning.
The question of Attorney Short if it was
not a fact that the profit from hauling a
train of twenty-six cars of oil was $721 67
was answered in the negative. Mr. Krutt
schnitt presented figures showing that the
profit did not exceed $138, or little more
than $5- a car.
Mr. Kruttschnitt said the spur -track to
the oil fields was built in opposition to
his counsel. He opposed the enterprise
because he did not believe it would ever
be a source of profit to. the company. The
proper method, in his opinion," for the oil
to reach a market was by means of a
pipe line. The expense of building the
track was enormous, "and.in the judgment
of the witness the company should not
have been forced to make this heavy out
lay.
General Manager Kruttschnitt of the
Southern Pacific was .the- first witness
called In the oil rate Investigation .before
the Railway Commissioners yesterday.
After testifying at some length concern
ing the cost of railway curves and tho
building of a spur track In the Kern Riv
er oil field, he vehemently dtnled that he
ever Invested a single dollar of his money
in any oil enterprises whatsoever.
Experts Says That. Freight
Schedule Is Very
Reasonable. *Â£?

POUGHKEEPSIE, N.T., Aug. 8.â About
8000 people were disappointed in the ex
hibition by Cresceus at the Hudson River
Driving Park this afternoon. Paced by a
running horse and driven by his owner,
George H. Ketcham, the champion went
his mile in 2:06Vi. He started shortly after
4 o'clock, after Ketcham had driven him
three warming-up heats. On the trial the
running horse picked up near the quarter,
which- Cresceus made In ZV.i. seconds. He
went to the half in 1:03, to the three-quar
ters in l:35Vi and to the wire "in 2:06V*.
There was faint applause when the time
was posted.
Ketcham said after the race: "My horse
did the best- "he could under the condi
tions. Neither the track nor the weather
was favorable to record-breaking speed.
The former was soft, and I was obliged
to pick the horse's position all the way.
The time is in no sense a reflection on my
horse's condition, and I think. he will be
at his best when he meets The Abbott at
Brighton Beach next Thursday."
The Olympic Club cyclers are on thÂ»
verge of disbanding. The famous organ
ization Is in sore straits by reason of the
action of the board of directors of the
Olympic Club compelling the athletic
members of the cycling organization to
become members of the club proper. A
meeting of the cyclers was held last even
ing in their rooms at the club and it ia
probably the last \hat will be held there.
A few weeks ago the officers off the club
discovered that there were certain mem
bers of the cycling organization who were
known as athletic members. They were
only compelled to pay 25 cents a month
and while training for race meets or road
races were permitted to use the gymna
sium and were trained by AI Lean. Ths
directors decided that the racing men
were getting off too cheaply and called a
halt. They gave them the alternative of
becoming athletic members of the club
and paying regular dues or quitting the
organization. The majority will resign, i
A special effort will be made to have the
directors rescind their action. The Baker
and Hamilton trophy has been won by the
Olympic Annex once. If the directors dis
band the organization the club will not
be represented in the coming road race,
and the Garden City Cyclers will have an
easy time securing the trophy, having
also won it once.

Sacramento 2, San Francisco 1.
San Francisco and Sacramento gave an
exhibition of clean, fast, scientific base
ball yesterday afternoon at Recreation
Park, and, although the contest was de
cidedly a pitchers' battle, the Infield of
both clubs had numerous chances and ac
cepted them In good style. Only two er
rors marred the sport, Devereaux and
Whalen being the offenders. '
Both Stricklett and Whalen were In rare
form, and the support they received was
far above the average, Stricklett was hit
safely but three -times, struck out three
of his opponents and allowed one man to
take his base. Whalen's record was four
hits, five strike-outs and two free passes
to the first station. It was simply a piece
of good fortune that the Statesmen won
out, as Hank's men played just as steady
a same.
The Lawmakers went to their work
with a vengeance, making their only
tallies in the initial inning. "Red Dog"
Devereaux got a walking ticket, went to
third on McLaughlin's safe drive to the
left garden and scored on Doyle's out at
first. Courtney in the meantime bunted
the ball, which "Chimmie der Whale"
handled in a clumsy manner and the pre
mier sticker was safe. Stricklett lined
out a hot one and was put out at first,
but not before McLaughlin had bounded
home with the second and what proved to
be the winning run. Stanley struck out
when his turn came, and Sacramento's
run-getting was over.
It was a case .of nothing doing with
both sides until the sixth round was
reached. Here the Germans secured their
first hit and only mark on the Scoreboard.
After two men had been put out Hilde
brand made a great bunt, reached first,
stole second and came home on
Schwartz's safe drive. Captain Pabst had
a good chance to tie the score, but made
an easy out, retiring the side.
Aside from the notable work of the
twirlers. Devereaux distinguished himself
by making two catches of the sensational
order. For the locals Hildebrand did the
best stick work, securing two out of the
three hits made by his team.
Hanlon was ill and did not play, Doyle
was put on first and Joe McCarthy graced
the right garden. Billy Hoffer, the new
pitcher signed by the Statesmen, was on
hand for practice and will be seen in the
box very soon. The score:

St. Louis justice is wrestling with .the case of a
k'oman who having been three times married and as
eften aivorced from the same man married him a
fourth time and is now seeking a fourth divorce. It
would seem that the best thing the courts could do
in a case of that kind would be to stand aside and let
the parties get the trouble out of the family by fight-
A young man in Connecticut who was about to be
married was told by his fiancee on the eve of the wed
ding that she preferred to marry another, whereupon
the accommodating youth not only gave up his
claims, but presented the lucky man with the wedding
ring he had bought for the occasion and moreover
consented to act as best man. The incident is a
striking illustration that the New England heart
keeps cool no matter what happens or how high the
thermometer goes.
Having gone to the front for that noble purpose,
Colonel Kilgour rose to second the nomination of a
candidate for the office of Clerk of the Court of Ap
peals, but when he obtained the floor, there came over
him a flood of memories. He recalled that once be
fore in that very hall he had in a Democratic conven
tion nominated another man for that same office, and
thereupon he. uttered the eloquent soul of him thus:
"Many moons have waxed and waned since it was my
pleasure, as it was my honor, to stand upon this floor
and in this very aisle, in the advocacy of that splen
did specimen" of manhood, that accomplished gentle
man, that bold and fearless champion of Democracy,
the lamented Frank Ford, for the nomination of the
Clerk of the Court of Appeals. But a short time since
the boatman with his silent oar called and bore him
over the river. In the County of St. -Mary's, where
every inch of soil has its story' of romance and of song,
his remains were laid to rest. The odors of the ear-
In these days", when there is so much talk of the
decline of American oratory, it is gratifying to have
this evidence that the spirit of it still burns and
breathes among us. Here, for example, is the way in
which Colonel Kilgour of Montgomery announced
his reason for attending the convention: "In the quiet
of a modest little home,. far removed from the mad
ding crowd's ignoble strife, where song and shadow
blend from the early blush of spring and through the
ripening leaves, I fancied I could hear the mutterings
of discord in the party I have loved so well and have
served so long and faithfully; and, though my name is
not McGregor, yet standing upon my native heath,
there in the hush of my secluded isolation, I swore I
swore that I would go to the front and help to make
the old commonwealth of Maryland Democratic once
more."
Having thus eliminated Bryanism from the contest
and having nothing more to do than to nominate
candidates for the offices of State Controller and of
Clerk of the Court of Appeals, one might suppose the
proceedings of the convention would be dull and
without vigor. Such, however, was not the case.
Maryland Democracy is never without as good a brand
of perverted oratory as ever flowed from the lips of
men who love red liquor, and much of it was turned
loose, to the delight of the delegates. Fortunately, a
good deal^ of it was fully reported, so that it can be
enjoyed in print by those who were far from the tu
multuous scene of its utterance.
DOWN in Maryland the Democratic conven
tion followed the example set by the Democ
racy of Ohio' and ignored Bryan and the
Bryan platform. They adopted declarations of prin
ciples and policies, beginning in this way: "We the
representatives of the Democracy of Maryland do not
feel it to be necessary at this time to do more in re
gard to national issues than to reaffirm our steadfast
allegiance to the'cardinal doctrines of the Democratic
party as expounded by its illustrious founder, Thomas
Jefferson, and our undiminished belief that adherence
to these doctrines will best preserve in its original in
tegrity and strength the constitutional government es
tablished by the fathers of the republic."
DEMOCRACY IN MARYLAND.
A New York magistrate recently told an offender
who had been convicted of drunkenness that he
would be permitted to go free provided he enlisted
in the navy, but otherwise he would be sent to jail.
Surely that is making a new use of our new navy. Is
Uncle Sam to run a naval annex to New York re
formatories?
From this time on every stanch and true Republican
should watch the tactics of the bosses and keep
posted. The issue at stake in the primaries is that of
controlling the Republican nominating convention,
and that in turn means whether the party shall have
a ticket of honest men or 'predatory politicians.* It
is a fight to a finish against the bosses, and every loyal
Republican should take part in it.
The appearance of the falsehoods is not surprising.
Kelly and Herrin and Gage are not noted for devo
tion to clean politics. As a rule they prefer to fish
in dirty water. It is safe to say they will start and
circulate all kinds of foul rumors from this time on.
They are fighting mainly by the aid of the slum bri
gades and they are going to make use of the weapons
with which the slum loafers are most expert.
The executive and advisory committees of the Re
publican Primary League have already had occasion
to denounce some of the more glaring falsehoods of
the predacious gang. In an official declaration pub
lished yesterday it was stated: "The Republican
Primary League denounces as absolutely false any
statement that it or any of its affiliated clubs or of
cers, or any person connected with it, has made or at
any time will make an;/ compromise in any Assembly
district or elsewhere with Martin Kelly, Phil Crim
mins or ?ny other boss. This declaration is issued
because one of the daily papers has published appar
, ently as a fact the absurd raving of a notorious poli
tical mountebank and acrobat (whose unsupported
utterances are not worth the dignity of a denial) that
such a combination with one of said bosses is re
ported to have been made in one of the Assembly
districts. The Republican Primary League cannot
make public too often its unequivocal and uncom
promising position in this regard."
AS the date of the primary election draws nearer
the bosses become more desperate in their
struggle to capture the Republican convention
and more unscrupulous in their methods. The pub
lic should be on guard against the fakes, roorbacks,
canards and general false statements which the gang
are likely to put into circulation from now 00.
THE TACTICS OF THE BOSSES
Food for thought is furnished by the fact that
Northern negroes, for generations native to this sec
tion, show none of the tendencies toward the- crimes
which are punished by the stake in the South. The
negro who for generations has been free and in con
tact with white communities where his legal rights
are respected is, as a rule, as law-abiding and or
derly and moral as his neighbors. This supports the
position of Booker Washington. The Northern negro
is part of the industrial community. He gets-'em
ployment,, and in many instances becomes an inde
pendent business man, or artisan. He shares in the
community life, has the same ties of family as his
white- neighbors, and, while respecting the racial dif
ferences between him and them, receives from them
the same respect. This condition of things in the
North' seems to negative the gloomy and barbarian
view taken by Tillman.' ,
The country has not much confidence in the judg
ment of Senator Tillman. But, unfortunately, it is
not a question of his judgment, but of agreement in
his opinion by the people of the South. South Caro
lina has a half millron whites to three-quarters of ci
million blacks, and if the stake and fire are really felt
by the half million to be their only protection against
the black majority, a most deplorable condition is
disclosed. If the South â¢ generally share Tillman's
opinion there seems to be no remedy except separa
tion of the races.
lightentnent.
Senator Tillman, in a recent address in Wisconsin,
boldly vindicated'the lynching of negroes, and had
the sympathy of his audience. Extending his address
he attacked Professor Booker Washington for ad
vocating the industrial education of the negro as a
remedy. Professor Washington thinks that educa
tion and industrial training of the negro will increase
the influence of civilization upon him, give him self
control and decrease his tendency toward any form of
crime. This is in line with the educational idea, and
heretofore it has been believed that the negro is no
exception to the ' influence of intelligence and en-
Negroes are now the most numerous victims of
lynching for all sorts of offenses, and we believe the
stake is reserved exclusively for them, as so far we
recall no white man that has been sacrificed by fire.
The last one, in Alabama, seems to have been ap
proved by both whites and blacks, for both partici
pated in it. The crime for which this extreme and
unlawful punishment is inflicted does not become less
frequent as the severity of reprisal increases. The sit
uation is one that must be extremely deplored.
Where a whole community is in sympathy with that
mode of punishment the law is powerless. In the na
ture of things lawless burning at the stake will soon
come to be the ordinary expression of community
vengeance for other offenses which have heretofore
been punished by lynching. Homicide and theft,
highway robbery and burglary, have all been in Judge
Lynch's court, and persons accused have been hanged
or shot. Very soon they will be burned at the stake.
IT seems to be impossible to rouse an opposition
in public opinion to the lynching of negroes by
burning at the stake. The first affair of the kind
was in Texas, less than five years ago, and now such
scenes are of monthly occurrence.

TV T EXT â¢ Tuesday night a . scene of
y magnificence wnTbe presented in
I \ Mechanics' Pavilion.: for on that
.â¢ date, the thirteenth sleep of the
.Sturgeon moon, a grand recep-'
tionwillbe tendered to the great chiefs
of the Improved Order of Red Men of the
reservation of California, the great chiefs
of the Degree of Pocahontas and the rep
resentatives to the two great councils.
The reception -will be followed br a ball
in a style never surpassed by any frater
nal organization In this city. This recep
tion and ball will be tendered by the com
bined^; tribes of San Francisco and the
councils, assisted by those of Oakland and
Alameda, The Pavilion is to be patrioti
cally decorated, for the order- is patriotic
as well as beneficial, and to that end the
committee in charge, will spare no effort
to make the immense building very at
tractive. The affair is a strictly invita
tional one and the number of tickets Is
sued is limited to two to each member of
the tribes and councils and two to each
great. chief and representative. Ten thou
sand tickets 'will be distributed in this
manner, but the demands for Invitations
greatly exceed that number. â¢
The following are the committees that
have charge of this grand event:
trade. And why not combine with his fellow worker? The rich
man thinks himself a superior mortal because he has had the
advantage of. wealth and society. But when honest nature madÂ©
some of them so near akin to the loboter that their fine framing
does them little good their education often proves only a gla
mor-a cheap finish that does not wear. I know many of these
well-dressed, finely/ groomed gentlemen that have no fine feel
ings about them, and under that fine or thin veneer are as In
considerate and as selfish as a wart hog.
Now, please allow me this little space in your valuable pa
per and show the world that you do not wish to treat the
workingmen as irresponsible beggars or parasites, and that they ">
are allowed to sell their labor at the best market, and that if hired
by the day they can quit by the day. The laborer i 9 simply
what capital has made him. Treat him kinder and he will be a
kinder man. Kindness begets kindness. The time haa come
when the workingman will not bow down his head to the press
and the pulpit. Lord Byron says, "A fool's labor, is easily
bought." Well, the workingman is setting onto himself, and if
capital will only give him good pay and short hours, so that he
can Improve his mind, he will soon cease to be a fool, a mule or
a. beggar. Give him leave to toil for his daily bread, enable him
to support his home and the home will support the nation. Re
spectfully yours, A WORKMAN.
San Francisco, Aug. 8.
When the machinists quitÂ«on May 30 did they break any
contract? No; but they did their duty like men until the last
moment. So much for organized laborâ and, as a rule, labor
unions keep their contracts. But the rich employer hates labor
unions, because he sees in union there, is strength. He knows
that by putting his money with some other fellow's'money, and
so on, he sees how strong it makes them. Now. what has the
poor man got? Nothing but his labor; that ia his stock in
can he not, and still break no contract. I know by bit
ter experience that the employer can lay a worker off at a mo
ment's notice. Many a time and oft have I seen a wor.]rman -
go to work in the morning, carrying his lunch â¢with him, only
to be told by the boss that owing to "circumstances he would
have to lay him off for the dayâ to come around to-morrow
morning and see if anything is ( doing. Where is the responsibil
ity in this .case? There is no responsibility on either side; only
the wage slaye gets It In the neck. If a workman were treated
with the same respect as bankers and college professors and
hired and paid by the year and then laid down his tool at a
moment's notice, then, and not until then, can you accuse
him of breaking a contract. -^ â¢ Â¦
Maintains That if Employers Join Forces, the Laborer, Whose Stock in. Trade
Is Only His Labor, Has the Right to Combine With His Fellow Worker.
* ~1 DITOR SAN FRANCISCO CAI/Lâ I noticed one of your
â i leading articles In your .editorial columns which I think
j was misleading as far as the "workingmen are concerned-.
If a man is hired by the day he can quit work any day,
No doubt this is the condition hoped for by" the
large interests in Great Britain', which are doing their
best to increase the friction in this country. There
is no doubt that the hope will be realized if the con
test is sufficiently prolonged. It may be questioned,
however, that Great Britain will get as much benefit
out of an American panic as her manufacturers hope
for. In the present interrelated conditions of trade it
is difficult to confine the suffering from hard times to
one country, and England is as likely to share in our
distress as she is to profit by it.
So great is the anxiety felt in England that the
London press makes no attempt at concealment. The"
strikes are spoken of as a revolution that will end in
armed resistance to capital, and there is adopted a
cunning undertone of appeal to the foreign element
in this country, in the supposition that its allegiance
to our institutions is not strong enough to resist the
promptings of personal or class selfishness. This sort
of foreign influence and interference is something new
in our industrial history. If our foreign rivals believe
that labor troubles here are favorable to them there
are many ways, open and covert, in which they can
add to the discords that are now on in every part of
this country. These ways may be open or they may
be secret. The danger of all organization is in its
misuse, and the greater the concentration of its' au
thority in few hands the greater is the opportunity
for the play of illicit motives. American observers all
admit one probability as the outcome. The legal re
sponsibilities of labor and capital being unequal, if
too great restrictions are insisted upon capital re
tires from the field and production and employment
cease. What comes then is familiar to all by reason
of recent experience. Panic, pinch and hard times
have usually been preceded by these contests, as in
1873 and 1893.' In the distribution of production cap
ital has to make contracts and be responsible for their
execution. Whenever there is doubt about its power
to fulfill its 'contracts by reason of threatened in
fringement upon its control of the operation of that
which it owns, capital ceases its activities, and enter
prise and confidence fall together.
Great Britain frankly admits that she lost her lead
by being weakened in the engineers' strike, which
lasted a year and so reduced her productive
power that she fell before our greater vigor and re
sources. Her experienced business men see in the
strikes in this country a chance to recover their trade
and position. Her laborers, realizing the serious con
sequences to them of the engineers' strike in the loss
of occupation, see at last their oneness of interest with
their employers and are ready to encourage their
American fellows in the same course which was dis
astrous to them and to British trade.
The cause of this trans- Atlantic sympathy need not
be sought far. Within a year and * a half we have
taken from Great Britain her supremacy and control
in the metal markets of the world. We have gone
ahead in steel, in structural metals, in machinery and
in tinplate. We have done this while paying nearly
twice as high wages as the British schedule.
ENGLISH manufacturers are showing a keen in
terest in the labor strikes in the United States.
English, labor "unions have been reported as
offering financial assistance to their, idle brethren in
this country, and the English unions and English
capital seem to be so agreed on the subject that it is
easily possible that capital may also extend a helping
hand, using the unions as its medium.
ENGLAND AND OUR STRIKES.
With such a champion why should Maryland Dem
ocracy hesitate to discard Bryan? Why should not
the banner be at once flung to the breeze, Kilgour for
President?
While the country takes little interest in Democracy
just now, there will be none the Jess a good deal of
satisfaction in knowing that the eloquent" Mr. Kil
gour is not going, back to the seclusion of his modest
home, but is going to stay at the front and talk more
beautiful things. He made a pledge to that effect in
these words: "As for myself,. I fully realize that with
me the. shadow is falling far westward; but, thank
God, in the full possession of every faculty of the
mind, and with nerves as strong as the sinews of the
lion, I will go into the campaign with all the vigor of
earlier years, and with my heart in the right place."
higher than, where the eagle builds her nest or the
deer makes her path, that their reflection may reach
along the shores of Worcester. Place the sentinel
on guard. Make every pass a Thermopylae. ,A11
along the line let the battle-cry be heard, 'A white
man's government, through. a white man's party!'
Then, on the morning of the 6th of November, as
'the booming of cannon hails the sun low wheeling
from the deep, the old flag will be seen, floating in
triumph, with'all of its former prestige and glory, and
the welkin will ring with the wild hallelujahs of joy."
.Passing from those 1 sad thoughts the orator, sec
onded the nomination <of his man, whom he described
as one he had met "amid the castellated splendors and
romantic beauties of .Garrett" when he was Y candi
date for County Comptroller, and when "his manly
appearance, his ringing and fearless utterance, and
above all his orthodox Democracy, thrilled and
charmed me." Proceeding to exhort the convention
to rouse for the fray Mr. Kilgour said: "Our homes
and our future are in this struggle. Kindle the fires
on the topmost peaks of the mountain of- Garrett
liest flowers of spring will. fall over and around his
moss-covered home, but they will reach him not down
in his unembroidered chamber; the bluebirds will
come and sing their first notes, "but he will not hear
their music; the winter's winds may shriek and howl
over the desolate plains and snow-capped hills, but
they will disturb "riot his slumber. There he will rest
all through the hours of the day and the nightâ under
the golden sunlight,' under 'the clinging stars. No
birdling's song, no floweret's perfumed breath can
purer or sweeter be than the emanations of his soul;
and no surisetf cloud nor line of life can be more grand,
more beautiful, than the example he has left us." *

REPUBLICAN PRIMARY LEAGUE
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT TICKETS
THE confidence of the Republican
Primary League In its ability to
down the allied bosses at the elec
tion next Tuesday is justified by
the immense attendance at league
headquarters. The workers in the cause of
liberal, honest and progressive municipal
government under the auspices off the Re
publican party are Inspired to renewed
efforts by the encouraging reports from
the several districts. Active Republicans,
v.-ho are animated by a firm determination
to give the bosses a thorough trouncing,
are making a house-to-house canvass in
some of the districts.
Martin Kelly's audacity In placing his
own name at the head of the boss ticket
In the Twenty-eighth District has kindled
in the Republican party of San Francisco
a new determination to fight bossism to
the finish. Now it is clearly and distinct
ly understood that a Kelly triumph in the
Twenty-eighth will be regarded as party
acceptance of Kelly leadership.
The Twenty-eighth District will be
called first on the roll of the Municipal
Convention. The first name on the boss
list of delegates in that district is Martin
Kelly. Shall Boss Kelly be permitted to
stand up in that convention as a repre
sentative citizen and speak first for the
Republican party of San Francisco? The
issue is up to the honest citizens of the
Twenty-eighth District. The time is ripe
for a great popular demonstration in the
Twenty-eighth against boss rule. Every
householder, taxpayer, workingman and
business man of Republican faith residing
in the district should resolve to partici
pate in the primary election next Tues
day and make it his special duty to bring
hi* neighbors to the polls. All the forces
of clean politics and honest municipal ruie
should be called out to defeat the corrupt
boss in his stronghold.
The weak and wavering say that the
Twenty-eighth is l>oss ridden and boss
mastered beyond afi hope of 'rescue. The
honest, square and resolute citizens of the
party can redeem the district from the
odium of Kellyism by attending to their
duties next Tuesday. This time the des
perate boss cannot stuff and smash the
ballot boxes. The arm of the law will
reach out and seize him if he attempts to
smash the voting urns and scatter the
ballots in the street.
Thirty-Seventh District.
A joint meeting of the delegates and
campaign committee of the Thirty-sev
enth Assembly District Primary League
Club was held at headquarters, 444 Devis
adero street, last night. The hall was
ftHed to the doers. J. K. Jones presided
and S. Bloom was secretary. The differ
ent branches of the club on Hayes and
Stanyan streets were fully represented.
A great many prominent citizens of the
Thirty-sevt-nth district for the first time
met as a campaign committee at a pri
mary election, and great enthusiasm pre
vailed. F<-r several hours a lively discus
! f!on on the plan of campaign was had.

Two Years for Burglary
John Ryan, who pleaded guilty in Judge
Cook's court to a charge of burglary for
breaking into the grocery of Louis Hoff
man at 341 Eddy street on June 26, ap
peared for sentence yesterday. He was
sent to Folsom penitentiary for two years.
On account of the large increase of busi
ness in the' San Francisco . Postoffice and'
on the representations made by Congress
man Loud the clerical force has been in
creased by the addition of fourteen at $600
per annum each. They will be assigned'
to-day to the departments most in need
of their services. Louis Miller has been
appointed superintendent of Station Kat
the Palace Hotel, vice Breed/deceased.
W J. Phillips, superintendent of Station
E," corner of Third and Townsend streets,
has been promoted to be assistant super
intendent of the city free delivery depart
ment, F.D. Griffith/ who held that-posi
tion;- having -been- appointed superintend
ent of Station E, vice Phillips. The sala
ries of- these two positions are the same.:.
Postoffice Force Increased.
The next step in the case will be to give
Sheriff Cudihee official notice of the filing
of; the papers and of the appeal and the
demand that all steps going to the hang
ins of Nordstrom cease. . : . ..
Judg-e : Jacobs held that no order allow
ing appeal was necessary, that none. was
contemplated by the statute. The law
made the taking of the appeal after the
court had jurisdiction a complete stay.
.The Nordstrom case differs from the Dur
rant case because the court there, through
Judge Morrow, would not allow the pa
pers to be filed in the , Federal . court.
Nordstrom's appeal papers will now reg
ularly ' be sent to the Supreme Court j of
the United States at Washington.
SEATTLE, Aug-. 8.â Murderer Nord
strom may not hang on August , 23, al
though the scaffold is being built. United
States Judge Hanford, in a letter directed
to James Hamilton Lewis, former Con
gressman from Washington, recently
warned him that he would take no notice
of the case in his court as he considered
Lewis' claim of appeals to be in effect a
travesty on justice. Nordstrom was con
victed over nine years ago of the murder
of little Willie Mason at Cedar Mountain,
but has been kept from the gallows by
Lewis' untiring efforts. To-day Judge
Hanford. modified his previously declared
position and granted the -motion of Nord
strom's counsel, after a second plea,
made yesterday afternoon, accepting his
papers. . ... â¢ Â¦
The unique feature of the proceeding- is
that though the Judge in the letter ad
dressed on July 26. to Colonel, 1 Lewis," re
fusing to grant the writ, said that he
would make no decision one way or the
other upon which an appeal might be
predicated, nevertheless . Lewis files the
Judge's letter in the Judge's own court as
the Judge's decision and claims the appeal
on that as the decision of the court, and
this appeal Judge Hanford allows to be
filed. The case Is now just where it waa
two years ago, when Judge Jacobs of the
Superior Court stayed Sheriff Vande
vanter from executing Nordstrom on the
ground that the taking of the appeal to
the Supreme Court of the United States,
after the Federal court had 1 taken juris
diction, operated as a stay of all proceed
ings, as the act of Congress provides that
after the appeal ia taken -all acts of any
State officer are illegal and void.
A fishing- boat In the channel at - the
time arrived In port this morning for
supplies, and the men on It substantiated
the reports. There were three Portuguese
aboard and they felt a superstitious awe
for the great meteorite. They saw it from
the deck of their schooner about 6 p. m.
They also stated that a sharp, swishing
sound disturbed the atmosphere. ,
These men watched It with Interest,
thinking that it was falling- in the lum
ber yards. As a matter of fact it was
many miles out over the channel. It was
yet broad daylight. The exact location
of the falling body cannot be ascertained,
but it bore to the southeast down the
channel.
The most authentic account of it was
given by Van E. Brown, superintendent
of a lumber yard at Steams' wharf. He
and Captain Reese were standing- on the
dock when both noticed what , they
thought was a Chinese balloon almost di
rectly overhead. As It came nearer it was
Been to be a ball of fire slowly revolving.
As it did so it seemed to unroll a fiery
ribbon, which stood in the atmosphere for
a second. It was so close that the sparks
from the trail were easily visible. The
color of the mass was an electrical Â¦white,
but the trail was made of. many brilliant
colors.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 8.â A large
and very brilliant meteorite fell in the
channel to the southeast of here Ia3t
evening about 6 o'clock. It was seen by
people here and by men on fishing- boats.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The two men at once began an attack
on the Rev. Dr. Green, accusing him of
blackmailing- his parishioners and extort
ing 1 money from them. Simms stated that
Dr. Green took $700 from poor members
of his congregation last month. There
upon trouble ensued. A diner at the next
table arose .'and unqualifiedly denounced
Dr. McReynolds and Simms as "liars"
and offered to fight them in what 'way'
they chose, singly or double. The cafe
was greatly disturbed and the two men
tried to escape, but their nemesis fol
lowed them out and insisted on an apol
ogy on the spot, which was given.
Dr. McReynolds left town on the after
noon Southern Pacific train to-day. Dr.
Green is content with the statement that
both men are "liars" and mentions noth
ing of the fact that his service .has been
gratuitous for two years . and that his
private fortune -has been* used to- help
members of his congregation' for that
time. Â¦ r ' ,
REDLANDS, Aug. 8.â Dr. Paul Mc-
Reynolds, the minister of the Christian
Church in Redlands, entered a local cafe
sometimes frequented by. the Rev. Dr.
Green, the Methodist minister, last even
ing. He was accompanied by C. F.
Simms, a well-known business man and
capitalist. The cafe was well filled at the
time. â¢ ...-'Â¦. .

After thus exhibiting his alleged author
ity he began clutching at his victim. This
attracted the attention of some passers
by who tried to prevail upon the man to
desist. Mrs. Cochrane, seeking- safety,
ran over to the Tlburon waiting-room.
The stranger pursued her. A number of
men attempted to stop him, but a drawn
revolver held them back.
Believing- that her satchel was all he
wanted Mrs. Cochrane threw it at nlm
as she ran. This, however, did not check
him for he paid no attention to it. What
might have been the outcome of the affair
can only be surmised for the police ar
rived at this stage of the proceeding's and
took possession of the belligerent indi
vidual. The entire party went to the po
lice station, where they left their names
and addresses. Mrs. Cochrane caught her
boat and her tall assailant was detained
by the officials. '
This afternoon Mrs. Cochrane. who had
been visiting 1 in San Francisco, went to
thÂ© ferry to board the 6:15 o'clock boat
for this city. With her. were Mrs. John
Gawne of San Leandro and Charles
Gawne and wife of Sonoma. Upon reach
ing the ferry building- a tall stranger
stepped up to Mrs. Cochrane and said:
"Turn over your grip. I arrest you."
At the same time he reached for a small
handbag that she carried. Not caring to
part with her property Mrs. Cochrane
stepped back and intimated that she
would not surrender it. This seemed to
Irritate her tormentor and he threw back
his coat, exposing a silver badge bearing

long time before Mrs. M. F. Cochrai.e,

city, will forget her experience with a
wild-eyed stranger in the waiting-room
of the Sausallto ferry in San Francisco
this afternoon. A wrenching by the arms,
threats with a revolver and a pursuit
about the building' for fifteen minutes are
features of the affair that were well cal
culated to disturb the strongest nerves.

There was a big tumult in the RIordan
Boss Club of the Forty-second District
last night. At the beginning of the cam
paign some good citizens were deluded
into joining the club, believing that the
delegates to be named on the ticket would
not be committed to the bosses. Last
night the well meaning 1 but misguided cit
izens were turned down to make room on
the ticket for job chasers and boss sym
pathizers. After the meeting many citi

character and purpose of the Riordan

He believed the business men were wak

existence for any man who dared, afttr

campaign, he said, called for individual
effort on the part of every citizen worthy
of the name and the battle cry should be
"Down with boss rule."
A meeting of the Fortieth District Re

evening at 2045 Point Lobos avenue. The
large attendance attested to the interest
the Richmond District is taking in the

The Democratic County Committee incloses
you herewith the names of proposed delegates
to the Democratic Municipal Convention, to be
voted for Tuesday, August 13, 1901. These
names represent the regular Democratic organi
zation and good government. They stand for
an honest, fearless, independent, economical
and business administration of city affairs. We
call attention to a few of the many good things
done by the present administration. Through
wise economy, great sums of public money,
hitherto wasted on running expenses, have been
saved and expended on public work, furnishing
permanent imr>royements to the city and labor
to the people. A debt of $320,000, brought down
from former administrations,, and representing
unpaid salaries and unpaid supplies consumed
by the city, has been paid. San Francisco does
not owe a dollar for current expenses. Gas
rates have been reduced. The people get
cheaper gas. Water rates have been reduced.
The people have cheaper water. Taxes have
been reduced. The tax rate is lower than ever.
The streets are better cleaned; and new ttreet
work is constantly making good streets out of
poor ones. The public buildings, parks and
public squares are better kept. New school
houses have been provided for, and are about
to be built. The law? have been observed and
enforced. No scandal or suspicion of dishon
esty has tainted the name of any officer of the
administration. Honesty In public life pays. It
pays the people. What has been done Is evi
dence of what will be done. . .
Encourage men who have faithfully served
your interests. Support men who have given to
this city clean, intelligent and efficient gov
ernment. Uphold Â¦ men who will maintain a
government of which all good people may be
proud. We present some figures on the bene
fits obtained by citizens under the present
administration: ,
Reduction In water rates, 1900 $135,000
Reduction in water rates, 1901 140,000
Total saved to ratepayers $275,000
Appropriated for construction of streets
and sewers $317,313
Permanent improvements to public build
ings .*. ., 218,485
For new public buildings 120,000
Paid back indebtedness to mercnants and
teachers, owing from past years 320,000
Or a grand total of $973,300
All this has been done within the dollar limit
and without incurring a dollar of public debt,
and it can be the boast of our citizens that as
a solvent and well conducted corporation this
city and county stands without a peer in the
grand array of our American cities.
Do we ask too much when we solicit your
support for a continuance of an administration
with a record such as this? Respectfully sub
mitted, jasper McDonald,
Chairman Democratic County Committee.

DECIDUOUS FRUITS.
Continued late' boats have resulted in con
siderable congestion on the wharves. Thus
Wednesday's boats from the river did not get
completely discharged until late that night, so
yesterday's arrivals came in upon already full
wharves. The result was an overstocked mar
ket. Price3 stood up all right as a rule, how
ever, as good sound fruit has. been scarce all
along and in good demand, the only kinds to
show any real weakness being Peaches and
Melons. Supplies of both these descriptions
are very liberal, though Peaches for canning
account are not in over supply and show no
weakness. Good Bartlett Pears bring top
prices without difficulty, and the canners are
taking all the Plums they can get. They are
receiving a good deal of contract fruit , just
now, however, which they are obliged to take
care of to the exclusion of the consigned fruit.

NEW YORK. Aug. 8.â Developments in the
stock market to-day favored operations for the
long account and the demand, which was
broader than for some time, carried many
properties to a substantially. higher level. In
dications were not wanting to show that
traders were attaching more importance to
the character of the crop ' news and the high
ratio of railroad earnings. These considera
tions outweighed the early repressive influence
on the market by the announcement of the
steel strike and stocks were purchased with
an apparent great show of confidence. Un
usual prominence was given to the trading In
the steel stocks, owing to the frequency with
which large blocks changed hands at a rising
scale. Professional operators were inclined to
cover shorts in these issues, owing to the re
sumption of work at some plants and the of
ficial announcement of the absorption of the
Shelby Tube Works. When the prices of steel
Etocks began to mount upward and reached a
level 2U<52 points respectively above yester
day's close for the common and preferred the
general market "kept pace with the movement
and exceeded those gains In some instances.
There were many interruptions to the general
rise during the day by profit taking and short
selling by the room operators, but the reces
sions were not very noteworthy except for the
United States Steel stocks, which ended about
a point below the best when a report circu
lated that a prominent operator was unload
ing stock purchased at a much lower, level.
This selling soon affected the other market,
but semi-stagnation soon resulted and the clos
ing dealings showed steadiness. Conspicuous
strength was displayed by St. Paul. Union Pa
cific, Missouri Pacific, Sugar and Lackawanna.
which were from 1% to 5 points higher and led
the gains in their respective groups. The
declaration of only the regular dividend on
Union Pacific was without effect on, the stock,
the price In fact ruling at 95*i. the best price
of the day, when the announcement was made.
No explanation was made of the rise to 99% at
the close by Missouri Pacific, but it was as
serted that a speculative interest was respon
sible for the movement. Stocks which usually
do not attain prominence In the dealings at
tracted some attention to-day owing to the
material character of their advances, the list
Including Great Northern preferred. General
Elecric. Consolidated Gas. Hocking Valley.
Colorado Southern first preferred. C. C. C. and
St. Louis. St: Lawrence and Adirondack and
Lake Erie and Western, which were 2@3 points
higher.
Monetary conditions were placed in a favor
able light by a steady gain by the banks on
sub-treasury operations, this morning's state
ment showing a gain of over $1,000,000 on the
week thus- far. Although sterling exchange
rates continue upward no apprehension is fel,t
of srold exports in the near future.
The bond market was strong to-day, the fea
ture being Mohawk and Malone incomes, which
advanced nearly 6 points. Total sales, par
value, $1,500,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

"'Present estimates place the volume of this
yfsrs corn crop at barely 1,^00.000.000 bushels
and may b*> less. Cotton as well has suffered
irom excessive hÂ»at and drought. The crop
hat. Ywen in a backward condition and below
the averagp from the start. In the Southwest,
especially in portions of Texas, the prolonged
dry rpell is believed to have caused consid
erable damage, but the news from that par
ticular quarter within the past few days has
fopen more encourapinB. Airainst these factors
Â«re may set a flattering European trade bal
ar.ee and a wonderfully Ftrong treasury po
sition: but while uncertainty exists as regards
our great crops, we can only expect a traders'
market. Hence I may but repeat my advice
of the 6th of June, at a time when great bull
activity carried prices of Etocks to their zenith.
As I thpn raid: 4 The present market affords
great facilities for getting long of stocks, as
there who now hold them have them for sale,
but those who buy at the present range of
prices I advise to get out with great celerity
on the rallies.' The market affords many op
portunities for quick and profitable turns with
in the limits of good judgment."
"Mu"h activity is hardly to be looked for
tntil the settlement of the steel strike. But
a more important and deterrent factor is the
reported corn and oat crop damage. The street
awaits with same anxiety the Government crop
report to be issued on the 10th inst.. which
will indicate the extent of the ravages of
drought and heat, especially at the end of
th*> hot wave, the effects of which were very
severe laM Saturday and Sunday, since my
laFt letter was iFsued. The damage on these
two day? alone if reported as very serious.
"The stock of gold in the United States
trpasury is now the largest In the history of
the Government, being $504,354,237. an Increase
elnce July 1 a year ago of $S1,000,000. This is
in strong contrast with the condition of the
trea5ury only about seven years ago, when it
Tra? about at the vanishing point. As a mat
ter of fact, at this critical moment a number
of sub-treasuries were hastily called upon to
rfmit by express what gold they had to New
York, resulting in $12.000,WQ being forwarded.
If any considerable part of this amount had
miscarried or been delayed twenty-four hours
the Goveminfr.t would have been compelled to
have defaulted in its demand gold payments
for the tim* b^ing at least.

Miss Hughes leax'es for Japan to-mor
row to study the educational system of
that country.
Miss Hughes said that in the English
school system thore were teachers and
testers, but no principals. The duties of
the testers are to watch the methods of
teachers and to give practical tests oc
raslonally. The English teach few sub
jects, hut all of them are taught in the
mast thorough manner. The American,
rurrleulum. fhe thought, was overcrowd
ed. In England there was little home
Â»tudy for children under 12 years of age,
a practice she would like to see encour
aged in every civilized country. The
speaker praised the American system of
Education, her only objection thereto- be
ing the tendency to teach too much, a
rondition that prevented absolute perfec
tion.
Prior to the formal reception Miss
Hughes delivered an address upon the
mbject. "Some Changes Which Are Tak
ing Place in English Education." She
*poke in favor of coeducation, saying that
thV adminiplrati\-e functions of the
teacher phould be purely of a business
nature. If she had her way the normal
school would be abolished out.of hand and
In* university substituted therefor. The
fchools should be free from political con
trol in this country as In England.
The distinguished English educator.
Miss Elizabeth Phillipps Hushes, appoint
ed by the late Queen Victoria as Univer
sity Commissioner of Great Britain, was

NEW RECORD AT BTTFFAXO
- A collection among the saloon passen
gers of the' Oceanic for the widows and
orphans of the drowned realized Â£160.
Among the seven who were drowne-1
was Fireman George Collins, who might
have saved himself, but went below to
endeavor to prevent the boilers bursting.
The Kincora was a coasting vessel, trad
ing between Waterford and Limerick. She i
was a steel screw steamer of 453 tons |
and belonged to the Waterford Steamship |
Company. She had a crew of twenty-one
men and the Oceanic brought the four
teen survivors to this port.
The Oceanic was going dead slow when
the collision occurred. All the Klncora's'
boats, were jammed and rendered useless
by the impact. Fourteen men, including
the captain, scrambled on Â¦ board the
Oceanic with the aid of ropes lowered
from the liner.
QUEENSTOWN, Aug. 8.â The Whlto
Star line steamer Oceanic, Captain Cam
eron, which sailed from Liverpool yes
terday for New York, via Queenstcwn,
arrived," here this morning, and reported
having' been in collision last night in the
Irish Channel with the . steamer Kincora
of Waterfprd, Ireland. The Kincora sank.
Seven persons were drowned. The col
lision occurred in a fog. The bow of the
Oceanic was damaged, but this will not
prevent her proceeding on her journey.
The raiders justify their action on the
ground that they bought the raisins, ht-ld
the warehouse receipt from the Growers'
Association and that the packing com
pany holds a 'lease of the packing-house
raided.
Just about 6 o'clock the crowd with a
special train of an engine and three cars
arrived -and proceeded to remove the
boxes of raisins. Among the prominent
raisin men in charge of the raiding party
were T. II. Lynch of Porter Brothers,
Lee Gray and Roy Paine of the Fresno
Home Company. Adam H. Mowat of the
Pacific Coast Seeded Raisin Company, C.
H. Detoy of the Phoenix and R. D. Rob
inson of the Griffin & Skelley Company.
Sheriff Collins declined to take any hand
in the matter Â¦without process of law.
FRESNO. Aug. 8.â The Pacific Coast
Seeded Raisin Company swooped down on
another packing-house to-night and lifted
all the goods In sight. The work was
well planned and done with dispatch. The
packing-house raided was that of Eiscn
& Velth, in the Donaboo-Emmons ware
house, on the Southern Pacific Company's
reservation in this city. The coup was
planned to take place at 6 o'clock. Thtre
was a watchman in charge of the place,
who had written orders to allow no one
to remove any of the goods without an
order from Eisen or .Velth or from the
court and he was instructed to use suffi
cient force to carry out the orders.

TRENTON, N. J., Aug. 8.â Ex-Governor
William A. Newell died at noon to-day at
his home In Alleton, N. J. The ex-Gov
ernor was in his eighty-fourth year and
had been in poor health for. some time,
owing largely to his advanced age. j
Governor Newell, who was a practicing
physician, was born in Ohio and came to
New Jersey when quite young. He was
a member of Congress, from this State
from 1847 to 1S31. Dr. Newell was elected
Governor of New Jersey in 1856 on the Re
publican ticket. He was again a candi
date for Governor against General Mc-
Clella'n, but was defeated. During the ad
ministration of President Hayes Governor
Newell was appointed Governor of Wash
ington Territory, and from that time until
about three years ago he made Washing
ton his home.

TACOMA, Aug. 8.â At the Presidio of
San Francisco three years ago Dr. E. M.
Brown, as medical examiner for the
Fourth Cavalry, examined Eben Bolce,
who is to be hanged for wife murder to
morrow morning. He then pronounced
Bolce Insane and refused to pass him for
enlistment. General Miller and Adjutant
Harris protested against this action, as
Bolce -was a eornetist and was needed for
the Fourth Cavalry band. At their ur
gent request Dr. Brown withdrew h!s re
port and Boice was allowed to enlist.
Until this afternoon Dr. Brown did not
know tliat Boice was the man whom he
pronounced insane. His testimony to this
effect would have been most Altai during
Boice's trial, when his plea of Insanity
was his only possible hope of escape. It

testify In a general way how a Philippine

Bolce. While in the Philippines Boice

makes her one of the most formidable

construed to be a request for the pro
tection of American interests, it was
deemed best to have the battleship at San
Francisco, from where she can proceed
without delay to the isthmus.
In view of Simmons' letter, which was
The selection of a battleship for this
prospective duty apparently gives a grav
ity to the situation, which in reality it
does not possess. Unfortunately, most of
the smaller ships are in Asiatic waters
and the department wa* obliged to
choose between unserviceable old wooden
Fhips and the fine new battleships on the
Pacific Ccast.
Acting Secretary of State Adee replied
to Simmons that the gunboat Machias had
been ordered to Coion, on the Atlantic
Bide,, but it was the view of officials dur
ing the day, both at the State and Xavy
derrartmentSN that there was no necessity
for sending down a ship on the Pacific
eide. For this reason Adee made no re*
tjuest on the Navy Department for an
other ship-, but as a matter of information
he transmitted the letter of Simmons to
the acting head of the Navy Department.
while this was not a request for a ship,
yet Hackett fen that it was quite desir
able to have one in readiness to go should
the recruest be made. He therefore di
rected that the order be sent to the Wis
consin to come down to San Francisco
and there await further orders.
WASHINGTON. Aug. S.â Just before

der was sent to Captain George O. Relter
of the battleship Wisconsin', now at Ana
cortes, near the Puget Sound naval sta
tion, to proceed to San Francisco-, from,
which point the battleship will be dis=
patched to Panama in case the State De
partment requests the presence of a ward
ship on the Pacific side of the iethmu*.
This action was taken after Acting Sec
retary Hackett had received front the
State Department a. request of J-. Edward
Simmons, president of the Panama Pall
road Company, setting forth the cerious^
nesa of the situation on the isthmus and
suggesting that warships be sent both tÂ©
the Atlantic and the Pacific side.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 8.â The annual
report of Major General MacArthur, dat
ed July 4Â» 1901Â» the day he relinquished
command of the Division of the Philip
pines, has been received at the War De
partment.
A considerable portion of the report is
devoted to the field operations of tho
army, showing that on October 1, 1900, it
occupied 413 stations, which was of neces
sity increased to 502 stations, every com
mand being in contact with some hostile
force. He speaks af the grood service of
the army, and says as a result of the co
operation between the army and the peo
ple who have accepted the invitation to
combine for mutual protection, the armed
Insurrection is aJmost suppressed.
General MacArthur gives the following
s Â£ uis ? c !L from Ma^ * 19W ' t0 J un e 30,
1SQ1 (during which time there were 1026
contacts between American troops and in
surgents), which show the casualties on
both sides:
Americansâ Killed, 245; wounded, 430;
captured, 118; missing, 20.
Insurgentsâ Killed, 2354; wounded, 1193:
captured, 6572; surrendered, 23,095.
General MacArthur gives a brief capit
ulation of the conditions in different prov
inces and says that at present the mold
ing force in the islands must be a well
organized army and navy.

The funeral services were quite simple,
being conducted by Rev. J. N. Anderson,
pastor of St. Paul's English Lutheran
Church.'
Then her friends remembered her and
her former clubmates assumed charge of
the funeral arrangements. Everything
that loving hands could do was done, and
to-day, when the funeral cortege entered
the cemetery, the . bachelor girls accom
panied the remains of their friend and
themselves bore her tenderly to the
grave. The six young ladles who were
appointed by the club to officiate as pall
bearers were Miss Rose Hunt,. Miss Agnes
Ahkman, Miss Nellie Ahkman, Miss
Katherine Petersen, Miss Mary McHugh
and Miss Annie Allen. The floral piece
sent by the Tirra Lirra was the club's
emblem, a heart of sweet peas and roses
resting on a gracefully constructed stand.
Miss Nevander drifted out of the club
circle to some extent when she moved to
Oakland. Her mother died and her father
went to Alaska, leaving her alone. ' She
was taken sick some days ago, and when
death came no relative was at her bed
side.
Some years ago Miss Nevander lived
with her parents In San Francisco. It
was proposed among some of her Blrl
friends that they should form a little club
of bachelor maidens to which no matron

eclipsed love for their little organization.
It was named the Tirra Lirra Club, and

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Aug. 8.â Rear Ad
miral Henry L. Howison, retired, selected
as a member of the Schley court of In
quiry, has never according" to naval of
ficials expressed an opinion as to the mer
its of the Schley-Sampson controversy.
Before orders were Issued assigning him
as a member of the court the Navy De
partment ascertained from him that he
was without bias and was prepared to
give an honest, fair decision. The alleged
statements made by Rear Admiral Howl
son were considered at the Navy Depart
ment to-day, but its officials declined to
admit whether they had been brought to
the attention of the rear admiral.
So far as known at the department the
assignment of Rear Admiral Howison
was entirely acceptable to. Rear Admiral
Schley. His name was among the list of
officers under consideration, which includ
ed Rear Admirals Belknap, Jouett, Gher
ardl and Miller, retired, and Rear Admiral
Farquhar. Any one of these, the depart
ment was Informed, would be satisfactory
to Rear Admiral Schley.
The Navy Department was advised by
Rear Admiral Remey to-day that he had
ordered Ensign William \ B. Wells from
the gunboat Frolic and Boatswain Dennis
J. O'Connell to report to the Bureau of
Navigation. These two officers served on
board the Brooklyn throughout the war
with Spain.
Boatswain O'Connell will testify that
Admiral Schley directed him to hoist the
signal prepared ! in advance by Admiral
Sampson ordering the ships to close in
and engage as soon as possible and en
deavor to sink the Spanish vessels or force
them to run ashore.
Practically every officer who was on the
Brooklyn will be brought to Washington
to testify before the court.
SILVER-STREET BOYS
HONOR THE ALEXANDERS
A cutting affray which Is surrounded by
mystery occurred last night on Second
street, and though the man who was
wounded and the man who is supposed to
have done the cutting are both In custody
the police are unable to gather any infor
mation as to the cause.
John Lunsky, who is supposed to have
done the cutting, says he is innocent,
though a razor was found in his hand
when he was arrested, and Edgar Calkins,
whose head was almost severed from his
body by the cut, avers that the police
have not got the right man. This is aa
much as either man will say.
Calkins walked from the scene of the
cutting: to a point on Third street, near
Jessie, when he fainted from loss of
blood. He was observed by Special Offi
cer Kelly, who summoned Officer Fraher
and they had the desperately wounded
man removed to the Emergency Hospital.
A hanger-on in the neighborhood told
the police officers that he had seen a man
rush into a saloon on the corner of Third
and Mission streets with a razor in hia
hand. When they entered the place the
only man who had a razor in his posses
sion was Lunsky, and they placed him
under arrest.
Lunsky denied his guilt, but the police
believe that they 'have the man who did
the cutting. He admitted having cut a
man a few minutes before he was ar
rested, but claimed to have done It In
self-defense. When he saw Calkins at the
hospital he claimed that he was not tha
man he had used the razor on. Calkins,
when asked to identify Lunsky, said that
he was not the man who had injured him.
and they both refused to say anything
else.
The doctors at the hospital say that
Calkins' life can be saved, though hÂ© i3
very weak from, loss of blood. The cut la
on the left side of the head and extends
from within a half inch of hla mouth
around the back of his neck and upward
almost to the top of his head.
Lunsky is a miner from Virginia City
and Calkins ia a cigar-maker. Detectives
Ryan and Whittaker have been detailed;

WASHINGTON, Aug. 8.â Attorney Gen
eral Knox has received the answer of
Judge Arthur H. Noyea of Alaska to the
charges made against him that he used
his position to his personal and financial
interests in the settlement of a number
of mining cases arising at Cape Nome.
Judge Noyes was recently granted leave
of absence to come on here, and in the
meantime he has sent on to the Attorney
General a written answer to the charges
that were preferred. He denies these
charges in whole, and alleges that rival
mining concerns are at the bottom of the
charges. Attorney General Knox will go
over the papers in the case to-day and
will possibly make them public in a day
or two. '/

The assessment of. the franchise of the
Contra. Costa Water Company was not
called up, and ?o no-test could be made as
to the temperature of Councilman Wlx
son's feet to see whether he had recov
ered from the indecision and frost of
Tuesday night. The assessment of the
water company's franchise will be called
up at some future -meeting, and so will
the plan of the' Council for the proposed
< general increase in the business section of
the city, for no decisive vote was taken
upon this question.
The City Council did not raise the as
sessments of Oakland property owners or
reduce that upon the Contra Costa Water
Company's franchise to-night. ; The spirit
might have been willing:, but the flesh
was weak. There were several hundred
property owners in. the lobby who had
been cited to appear and show cause why
their assessments should not be raised,
and the presence of tnese people acted as
a dampener. Even when Frederick Kahn
of Kahn Bros, rippled the atmosphere and
set the lobby to applauding: with his criti
cisms of the present. Council the only one
who arose to the^occasion was Council
man Bon, who talked back at the dry
gooda merchant. \

The trains left here shortly after 8
o'clock this morning. At Confluence the
first section was stopped and the second
section, rounding the curve and gcing at
the rate of thirty-five miles an hour,
crashed into it. The engine of the second
section and three cars werei wrecked and
traffic was delayed several hours. The
injured named were removed to the hos
pital and the ethers continued on their
way to Atlantic City. The accident is
supposed to have been caused by a mis
take in signals.
A ConnellsvllJe dispatch says there were
three big sections of the express. As the
third section neared Confluence the en
gineer suddenly saw something looming
before him on the track. It was the rear
end of section two. It was then too late
to avoid the disaster, and the engineer
and fireman of the third section jumped.
The third section crashed Into the Pull
man car of the rear of the second section,
telescoping it. The people in the rear car
were mingled with the debris and many
were seriously hurt, the total list number
ing about ten. Messages were immediate
ly sent to Connellsville, and a train of
three passenger coaches was made up and
hurried to the scene. On board were three
physicians. The injured were brought to
this city. With,the exception of the fire
man all it is thought will recover. .

KAHN ATTACKS
CITY COUNCIL
In response, to an inquiry from the Inte
rior Department, Governor Dole - has re
ported that in cases of exchanges of land
authorized by the laws of Hawaii it has
been his custom to have private parties
convey the title to such lands to the Ter
ritory of Hawaii, and not to the United
States. Secretary Hitchcock in reply has
requested that no further conveyance of
this kind be made until further advised
by thÂ« department. Governor Dole has re
ported to the. Interior Department that
the Hawaiian Territory will adopt the
rules and regulations of the Interior De
partment in executing its bonds and con
tracts in future.
The Secretary of the Interior In his lat
est reply says that new legislation Is In
dispensable to the bonded issue, and that
the Governor has not indicated that such
legislation has been had, nor can it be
safely anticipated. -
The purchase by employes of the Ha
waiian Territorial Government of lots or
other public â¢ property at public auction
has called forth a communication from
Secretary Hitchcock to Governor Dole, in
which he says that even should there be
no legal objection to these employes mak
ing such purchases, permitting them to
do so is a matter of questionable pro
priety. . â¢ . i
WASHINGTON, Aug. 8.â It developed
to-day that the Governoivhas twice pro
posed the issue of bonds Co effect needed
public improvements.. The Secretary of
the Interior on both occasions declined to
entertain the plan. Governor Dole first
requested, June 4, the approval of the
President for a proposed issue of an un
stated ' amount of so-called Hawaiian
treasury notes,, under act 79 of the pro
visional Hawaiian Government, a part of
the civil laws of Hawaii in 1897. The ob
ject Â¦was to procure a temporary loan to
replenish the Territorial treasury. Secre
tary Hitchcock replied that the fact that
the amount was neither stated nor esti
mated was of Itself a sufficient objection.
The Governor had. Inclosed an opinion of
the Territorial Attorneys General, which
the Secretary, in his reply declining to
take up the plan, says does not directly
express the~ opinion that the proposed In
debtedness can be lawfully incurred under
existing laws. He inclosed a certified copy
of act 71 of the laws of 1896, providing for
a loan of $2,000,000, and statements of the
Treasurer showing that there remain un
issued bonds amounting to $799,000 author
ized by the act; that the assessed value
of the Territory is $97,094,104, and that the
outstanding bonded indebtedness after
payment will be $940,000. : The Governor
then recommends the issuance of Terri
torial bonds for $799,000, chargeable on the
general revenues of the Territory, but not
on the credit of the public domain, to be
redeemable in not less than five years and
payable in not more than fifteen years
from date of isuue, provided that the-Ter
ritorial Legislature -shall pass the neces
sary appropriation bill providing for the
expenditures set forth in section 55 in the
Territorial act.

The deputies now employed say it is
their intention to appeal the case to the
Supreme Court. They claim that there
is still another injunction in effect to pre
vent the appointment of civil service dep
uties in the Seyden case, in which the
Civil Service Commission is charged with
conducting unfair examinations in not
providing different sets of questions for
the tax and license offices. This case is
r.ow pending and will be decided in a
short time.
Mayor Phelan summoned Tax Collector
Scott to his office yesterday and asked
him whether he would accept the civil
service eligible for Deputy Tax Collec
tors in view of Judge Murasky's decisions
that his old deputies are not entitled to
salary. Scott said he desired to comply
with the law, but insisted en seeing his
legal adviser, A. Ruef, before announcing
his decision. After a consultation with
Ruef. Scott stated that he would give a
decided answer to-day.

business to transact which requires the
seal of the office," says McCabe, "upon
proper application the seal will be affixed
to any instrument necessary for the
proper discharge of the duties of the

fice In the Crocker building."
McCabe was appointed by Governor
Eudd in December, 1S9S, for four years.
and he expects to retain the office until
his term expires.
McCabe' s replv was to the effect that he
had the keys, but since the commission
had only fixed the offices In the Clunie
building for the month of July he had on
August 1 removed the eeal of the com
mission to his office in the Crocker build

Shortridge was appointed a Building
and Loan Commissioner to succeed E. D.
McCabe in June. He has made every ef
fort to reap the benefits of his appoint
ment, but a warrant- for a half month's
salary Issued to him by the State Con
troller is the sum of his success In this
direction.
A week ago McCabe received the follow

Some doubt exists In City Hall circle*
as to whether or not the ordinance passed
by the Board of Supervisors declaring
next Tuesday a legal holiday affects the
so-called county offices. Godchaux has
not yet decided whether or not he will
close his office. He says the days on
which he shall close are specified by the
Political Code, and he doubts whether the
Board of Supervisors has the authority,
even though delegated by the legislative
act. to close his office. Other county of
fices, such as the Assessor, County Clerk
and Sheriff, are In the same category, and

Miss Roberts was on the stage and was
not told of the assault until the curtain
had dropped. She then grew hysterical
and her friends had hard work pacifying
her.
Robbery was the motive of the assault.
Mr. Morrison was on his way to escort
his wife, Florence Roberts, home from
the Alcazar Theater. He resides on ElUa
street, near Franklin, and was walking
leisurely along Ellis ' when the footpad
accosted him. Mr. Morrison was taken
by surprise and offered feeble resistance.
The thief grabbed for his watch, but was
frustrated, as the actor's coat was but
toned. Mr. Morrison then tried to push
his assailant from him. at the same time
calling loudly to him to desist'. The foot
pad, seeing that he had a feeble man to
contend with, struck his victim In the
mouth, felling him to the sidewalk. He
gave him a few kicks and ran away.
Mr. Morrison was dazed by the blows,
but staggered to his feet. He reeled down
Ellis street, and hundreds of passersby
wondered what had happened to him. Ha
was covered with blood and presented a
pitiable appearance. He went directly to
the dressing-room of Florence Roberts at

Mayor Phelan has requested the Supe

by trial jurors will in the future be paid
for actual services only. The appropria
tion for the purpose is $16,000, and as it
has been the, custom to pay the Jurors
when their names are called whether the
case proceeds or not $30,000 will be neces
sary to meet the demands.
The Mayor also requested the Police
Judges not to exceed the appropriation of
$6000 for the care of children committed
to the Boys' and Girls' Aid Society. Last
year the appropriation was exceeded by
$425.

At the completion of the ceremonies the
various uniformed German societies will
pass in review before the statue and place
floral offerings upon the pedestal.
In the evening there are to be exercises
in Native Sons' Hall. The programme for
the evening will be both musical and lit

fessor Goebel of Stanford and Professor
A. Putzker will deliver addresses. Miss
Maida Castelhun will recite an original
poem written for the occasion by her
father. Dr. P. C. Castelhun.
It was found that the statue could be
duplicated in bronze, transported to this
city and set up for about $15,000. To raise
this sum there was held the great Ger
man festival of the autumn of 1S95. This
was a week's celebration in Mechanics'
Pavilion. Goethe and Schiller were the
invisible patrons of the whole affair.
Scenes . from their works, passages and
tableaux from their dramas, were pre
sented with an elaborate setting. In fact,
the setting was entirely too elaborate, for
when the receipts were counted it was
found that, although $27,000 had been
taken in,- the expense was so great that
there remained only $5000. â¢
With only one-third of the required sum
in hand the committee set about to raise
the remainder by private subscription.
.Two years ago the order for the casting
was Â£iven.
The monument is In bronze on a base
of brown Missouri granite. The figures
are eleven feet in height and the base and
pedestal fourteen feet. The position the
statue will occupy is a most commanding
one, midway between the museum and
the Japanese tea garden, and in full view
of the music stand. The ceremonies at
tending the unveiling of the statue on
Sunday afternoon are to be most elabor
ate. There is to be music by the park
orchestra, grand choruses of the united
German singing societies, an original
poem, written by Theodore Kirchhof and
to be read by M. Greenblatt, and us ora

of Stanford University.
