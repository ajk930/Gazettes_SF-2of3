gressman Charles Curtis < of the First
Kansas -District, in addressing the old
soldiers at the Wyandotte County Vet

in defense of Admiral Schley in the San

; "In the late war," said Mr. Curtis,
"Dewey on May 1 achieved the n/rst bril
liant'victory in the history of naval, war
fare. That engagement held the . record
untn the American fleet destroyed the
Spanish boats under Ce'rvera' at Santiago,
with Schley on the bridge of the Brook

command of the fleet, but he was four
miles away when the battle was won."
The statement was greeted with cheers.

. It has been determined that ' Raynor
shall draw up the brief of Admiral
Schley, and after Wednesday's meeting
he will go to Capron Springs, West .Vir
ginia, where he will, write the brief.*
with Admiral Schley. in next Monday,
and still another meeting on Wednesday.
Soon after the adjournment of the con
ference- former Judge .Wilson left for his
summer home at Oakland, Maryland, and
Raynor left 'or Roitimore.-
Captain Parker will remain in Washing
ton and will resume, his examination of
the Navy Department records." There will
be another" meeting of all 'the lawyers
"Yes, several," was the response. "But
it would not be'timelytb speak 'of them
now. Admiral Schley does not desire any
secrecy in this matter, but It Is well to
await the court of inquiry.".
"We considered the precept of the court
of Inquiry," said he, "and examined nu
merous papers and documents bearing
upon the movements of the fleet from the
time it sailed from Key West to May 27,
and then from the Â¦ time Cervera's fleet
was located in Santiago harbor to July 3,
when it was destroyed."
"Did you find any new points bearing
on the case?"
Captain Parker had with him all of the
data he had secured by his examination
of the official records in the Navy De
partment, and he and Admiral Schley ex
plained to Wilson and Raynor many mat
ters which these gentlemen, not being
sailors, had not understood. At the con
clusion of the conference Raynor made
a guarded statement for publication. He
said another conference would be held
on Monday, at which time Admiral
Schley would give his counsel a list of
his witnesses' and then a > request- would
be sent to the Navy Department for a
list of witnesses to be summoned by the
department. Raynor said he did not
know whether the department would fur
nish this list, but he thought thaV Ad
miral Schley had a right to have it. '
ence to-day in the rooms of former
Judge J. M. Wilson in the Shoreham
Hotel? Admiral Schley,. gave his counsel
a detailed account of the movements of
the flying squadron and of his actions
from the time. he left Key West on May
19, 1898, until the destruction of Cervera's

The little cruiser Ranger, which is at San

She is very ' slow, however, making not
more than six knots, and as the distance
to Panama is about 270O miles, . it would
require almost fifteen days for her to

FIFTY BRITISH SCOUTS
CAPTURED BY THE BOERS
One. of the strongest candidates for tha
presidency is believed to be Horace G.
Burt, president of the Union Pacific. Mr.
Burt Is a railroad man second to none in
reputation and ability and Is high In the
good graces of Harriman and that gentle
man's following. In fact Harriman has
such confidence in the ability of Mr. Burt
that he placed the reconstruction of the
Central Pacific in Burt'a hands, which
action on the part of Harriman was one
of the several causes of complaint on tho
part of Hays. Samull Felton of the Chi
cago and Alton is also mentioned for the'
place. Mr. Felton's chances, however,
are considered but small by those on the
Inside.
â¢ The reasons that have led up to the
resignation of Mr. Hays have already
been printed in The Call. Briefly they
may be said to be his general dissatisfac
tion with a position which has been
shorn of most of Its power and authority.
Owing ; to the influence of the .Union Pa
cific element, which is entirely subordi
nated to Harriman. Hays has, from time
to time, had his powers curtailed until
now he is little more than a mere figure
head. He has seen both Stubbs and Her-
Burt, a likely Candidate.
On the other hand Randolph is a warm
favorite of Huntlngton'a, and the ability
he displayed In his conduct of the Tucson
end of the business has raised him high
in the estimation of the man whose name
Is now such a power In the world of rails.
It was at the urgent request of Mrr Hun
tington that Randolph resigned the super
intendency of the Tucson division to takÂ»
charge of Huntlngton's street car line*
in Los Angeles, and it is an assured fact
that he will be called from that place to
assume the management of the greater
railway concern If Huntington once gets
In a position where he can do as ha
pleases. -
If, however, Mr. Huntington does be
come president it is almost a certainty
that General Manager Kruttschnitt will
follow Hays into retirement and that
Epes Randolph, who formerly had charge
of the Tucson division of the Southern
Pacific, will be the one who will* succeed
him. It Is a well-known fact that there
is not much love existing between Hunt
ington and Kruttschnitt and that when
the nephew of his uncle was assistant to
the president there was not always that
absence of friction between the two which
should characterize a well-ordered execu
tive department of a big corporation.
The name of the man who will step into
Hays" place Is still a matter of conjec
ture. That H. E. Huntington will be the
one who will take up the reins of gov
ernment is by no means certain. Mr.
Huntington is thoroughly In touch with
all the details of active management. â¢ He
has the confidence of the controlling in
terests and the strong friendship and sup
port of Harriman. Yet Mr. Huntington
has often expressed himself on this Very
subject and all of his utterances have
been against any such arrangement.
Furthermore, since the death of his uncle
his own private concerns have so thor
oughly taken up his time and require to
much of his attention that it Is doubtful
if he would be able to take upon his
shoulders such a burden as the presi
dency of the consolidated systems with
out greatly sacrificing his private inter
ests. .<*'"'
The telegram comes from a source
whose reliability cannot be doubted and
it states positively and unequivocally that
the resignation of Sir. Hays is now In the
hands of his superiors. Moreover, there
seems to be every likelihood that the man
who will succeed Hays will be president
of both the Union and Southern Pacific
systems and that the two roads will be
consolidated under one management that
will eventually give the traveling public
a half day service between this
city and Chicago and will place one ex
ecutive officer^ at the head of the syn
dicate line., \
N"ot Likely to Be Huntington. â¢
For several days past rumors based on
earlier stories published in. the columns
of this paper have been floating wildly
about the street. These rumors have
heretofore lacked positive confirmation,
and the best the public had to go by. was
the wild guesses of this man and that
man; nothing was stated as a certainty.
The wires 'between this city and New
York were kept hot with inquiries, but as
Harriman himself was absent from the
Eastern metropolis no authentic news
was received until yesterday afternoon,
when one of the local railway magnates
received a * dispatch containing absolute
confirmation of the story.
Charles M. Hays has resigned from the
presidency of the Southern Pacific road.
This* is positive and is exactly what The
Call a month ago predicted would happen.

was at play. At the time of the discov

wages at the Panter & LHsch mine in the
Old Diggings district. While at play one
day in the weeds about 100 yards from tho
Meek home the young boy discovered a
email ledge. He was a miner by instinct
and appreciated his find enough to show
it to his father. Meek began to develop
the mine.- It was made; to pay. and the
fortunate owner is now reaping the re

under water. Farther north, near
Tehach.ipi, more washouts are reported
and all Santa Fe trains from San Fran

SEATTLE, Aug. 16,â Adolph Schreiber,

Â¦what cccurred.
When the "freighter" arrived at Cov
ington it stopped for a brief time. While
the train was standing two- young men
about his own age approached him and
cajoled him into entering a box car. After
the youthful murderers had him securely
in their power they simultaneously drew
revolvers and ordered. "Hands up." The
young- man hesitated in complying in this
and was shot through both arms, causing
them to drop to his sides. At this junc
ture, the victim said in a dying breath,
his assailants proceeded to rifle his pock
ets, obtaining $18.

tried to run. whereupon two more shots
were flred, both taking effect in his left
side. He was then kicked from the box
car and lay paralyzed and half conscious

BLOOIffS OF SANTA CBUZ
IN .BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY
Great Throng of Visitors at the Sea-
side City Views the Floral
Exhibit.
SAXTA CRUZ. Augr. 16.â The people of
this city had a revel in a "fire of flowers
and glowing grasses" to-day when the
floral exhibit in the rooms of the Free
Library was opened. The blooms on ex
hibition were the rarest in the county and
included everything from the reddest of
garden roses to the strong sea daisies
that feast on the sun along the incompar
able cliff drive.
A great crowd of visitors was present.
The general arrangement was in charge
of H. Hesler of Chicago and Miss E. W.
Boston of this city. Miss M. Waterman,
librarian, and Miss Mabelle Chace, the
assistant librarian, had also been untiring
in their efforts to make the display a suc
ces?s. -
E. Lcedham, who 5s acknowledged to be
the leading grower of dahlias in the Stats,
had an immense collection on display. In
his garden he has 200 varieties and near
ly all were in evidence to-day. The May
or of the city, who is a lover of flowers,
had a table. On it were palms, delicate
ferns and a large variety of immense car
nations, all of which were outdoor pro
ducts. His collection of gloxinias was va
ried and g-orpeous in color. He also had
pome immense tube roses, begronias and
some pretty sweet peas. Thomas Thomp
son exhibited many pots of ferns, pome
irr.mense carnations and some fine East
ern golden rod. His collection of roses
Â¦was especially worthy of note.
The exhibit of ferns by Miss E. "W. Bos
ton is of wondrous beauty. Miss Boston
has made a study of the cultivation of
ferns a.nd rare mosses, and the success of
her endeavors Is apparent in the beautiful
display she has made. Her ferns are ali
of out of door growth and of surprising
size and delicacy.
Paul Wench showed an assortment of
gladiolas and sweet peas. E. King's spe
cialties were asters of several shades, also
en assortment of other flowers. P. Thrift
showed about thirty varieties of dahlias,
and Mr. Miller over fifty varieties of this
flower.
Experimental Beet Crop a Success.
SANTA BARBARA. Aug. 16.â The pick-
Ing of beets is now well under way in an
experimental field in the Goleta Valley.
A gang of toppers is up from Oxnard. and
a car of beets per day Is the shipment
record so far. Judge William Roberts
said to-day that the beets were yielding
from 15 to 27 per cent of sugar. They are
of the finest quality, although lack of late
rains made them email. About 1500 tons
â¢will be the result of the experiment.
Plans are already being made looking to
the planting of a large acreage in Goleta
next year. 'Â¦'.Â¦Â¦'

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 15.-Hot words,
but no bloodshed, characterized the meet
ing â¢ of the State Board of Equalization
to-day, the quarrel being between Chair
man Alexander Brown and Equalizer
Beamer on the one side and Equalizer
Toland â¢ on the other. Equalizers- L. H.
Brown j and Colgan maintained discreet
silence.
The real ; trouble orislViated with the re
marks made by Equalizer Toland at the
time of tho assessment of railroads some
weeks ago, when he reflected upon the
action of other 'members of the board in
refusing to assess certain branch or spur
lines contained entirely , within certain
counties and "assessed by^the County As
sessors. Â¦ :" - <Â¦ . Â¦ \~
The excuse' for the discussion to-day
was a remark made by Toland in response
to Chairman Brown. -Equalizer Beamer
had moved to cite certain counties before
the board, to state what reason, if any.
there was why their assessment should
not be raised. Toland went into a lengthy
explanation of why he did not second the
motion, which Beamer . interrupted, say
ing that his motion . had received no sec
ond and he, -therefore, saw no necessity
for the discussion. ' Â¦
Chairman Brownâ While .this matter is up
I want to say right now and here that at the
time the matter of the assessment of railroads
was before the board -you used language that
was Insulting to this board, which reflected in
a constructive sense upon Us integrity. You
at that time impugned the motives of the
members. of the board and in direct language
stated that the board took its Judgment from
Mr. Ryan of the Southern Pacific. I want to
have you understand that I regard such lan
guage as you used as ungentlemanly and en
tirely uncalled for. It was not at all in keep
ing with the respect due to your colleagues.
Mr. Tolandâ That is merely your opinion and
vour opinion has nothing- to do with the case.
Brown Threatens Toland.
Chairman Brownâ I want to say right here.
Mr. Toland, that if you at any other time
use such language I- for my part Bhall settle
it right then and there. . , - .
Mr. Tolandâ I am ? responsible for ; what' I
say and am ready, to answer for. my state
ments- at any time and any place..- . , Â¦
Mr. Beamerâ I am sorry- that this matter
csme up to-day in this way, but now that it
Is up, I want to say that I felt pretty keenly
one remark which Mr. â¢ Toland made at the
time referred to.- When' he said we took our
figures and jurisdiction from Black Ryan; I
felt that he was going altogether too far and
showing very little consideration . for the feel-r
ing ' of . members of .'this .board. I felt that
he had no right to say such a thing. He had
no right to think it and. if he did think it he
should show some respect for the - feelings of
his colleagues. The statement was unneces
sary and was neither fair nor right. I ! think
that statement, at least, should be modified.
I don't see any call. for it. I am governed in
my action upon this board simply and solely
by my own conscience and I object strenuously
to Mr. Toland's taking the occasion he did,
with a hired assassin of men's characters sit
ting there to write It up to his glorification an<l
to our detriment. Â¦ ' >
Mr. ' Tolandâ The words I used were based
upon facts and were argumentative. They
were based upon the fact that roads were
assessed by county Assessors which were not
assessed by this board. Those were the- facts
and I cannot change them.
Puts a Hypothetical Question.
Mr. Beamerâ You started this "trying lan
guage," Mr. Toland. You have shown very
little consideration for the feelings of your
associates. Now, suppose that when you were
making that parade and when you said that
we took our jurisdiction from Black Ryan, I
had said you -were taking your Jurisdiction
from the San Francisco Examiner, which would
not live up to its contract with the .railroad,
would you not have replied in pretty strong
language?
Mr. Toland â If you said that I -would have
said that I was using my own jurisdiction and
that you were saying that which was not a
fact iV-i-viiv;
Mr. Beamerâ And in so doing you would have
reflected upon .ray word, and I would not have
stood that for one moment.
The discussion was : dropped at this
point. Controller Colgan interrupting to
second a motion made by L.. H. Brown at
the start to accept the figures of assess
ment given by the county Auditors, except
in the case of Modoc County, which has
not reported, and to accept the Assessor's
figures in that county 'for the purpose of
State assessment. The motion was car
ried, Beamer alone voting "No."
At the opening of the session L. H.
Brown made the motion which was finally
carried, but at that time it received no
second. He moved that the Calaveras,
Fresno, Glenn, â¢ Kern, Kings, Madera,
Merced, San Joaquin, Solano, Stanislaus,
Tehama, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba counties
be cited to appear before the board and
give reasons why their assessment should
not be lowered. v - ' .

my trousers in his hands, making for the
window. I threw myself upon him just
as he was about to jump out and crashed
against the casing, i breaking it into a
thousand . pieces. Then we clinched and
staggered around the room, each trying
to throw the other, until we fell against

from somewhere about his person and
made a* vicious dig at me. . â¢
" 'Let me go or I'll kill you,' .he said;
'I- haven't got your money.'
"But I was determined to have him and
held on, crying for help all the time. He
got one arm loose and attacked me sav
agely, with the knife, inflicting a half
doz^n wounds before I let him up. I felt
the blood running. down my arm and from
a cut in my\ face, but was so excited and
angry that I experienced no pain. When
I released him he made another dive for
the window, but I caught at his feet and
he 'cut at me â¢ again. Realizing that I
; would be killed if I, held him longer I let
go 1 and, he made his escape through the
.window, which opened into the hall.
"The -whole house was aroused by the
noise of the scuffle and : : my cries, and
when I reached the hall I saw the burglar
running past a dozen sleepy and startled

CHICAGO, Aug. 16.â Garhardt Terlinden
of Duisburg. Germany, accused of forgery
and embezzlement by the German Gov
ernment, was captured in Milwaukee by
Chicago .Plnkerton detectives and brought
to this city for safekeeping.
The prisoner is wanted by. the German
authorities on a charge of having forged
anil hypothecated 1,500,000 marks' worth
of charter* and securities, the property
of the. Garhard!-. Terlinden Company of
Duisburg. of- which he was manager. ' â¢
The business was a land : improvement
and investment enterprise, and it is said
that a great number of poor persons were
financially ruine-t by the alleged defal

equivalent of the sum Herr Terlinden is
charged with having taken is $375,000. He

modified as to the amount. The reason
given for the Tatter statement is that the
men who are behind the reduction move
ment believe that if any reduction Is jus
tifiable It must be large enough to allow
the mills to compete with : mills every
where, and, especially In the South.
To-night the executive committee of the
"Weavers* Association called a special

The announcement of the project met with the most hearty approval of the
steamship people and the public generally, and most of the managers of the great
trans-Atlantic lines undertQok to have the several vessels of their respective
fleets equipped Â¦with the Marconi system and to have their captains co-operate
to the fullest extent to bring out the greatest possible results.' They have as a
rule carried out their promises and their captains are prepared to "call" the Nan
tucket lightship while yet from 100 to 150 miles away and announce the approach
ing vessel.
. From the lightship the news will be at once transmitted by "wireless" to San
katy Head on Nantucket Island and thence by telephone and cable across that
island and Marthas Vineyard and the intervening waters to Woods Holl on the
mainland, whence the land, lines will carry it to the Herald office In. "New York
and The Call office in this city, and a few moments later, by bulletin and wire.
S the people of New York City and the rest of the country will have it And all
this' while the vessel is yet over 200 miles from Sandy Hook.
The possibilities of the Marconi system are yet untried. Â¦ With this constant
practical evocation .of .Its possibilities one need not be surprised to hear from time
to time of new and more wonderful achievements. ,Â¦ * '"
The Call's efforts in the matter of wireless telegraphy for this coast will prob-.
ably soon result in having a system of reporting ships between the Farallones and
the Golden Gate; an innovation that will be of great benefit to the merchant ma
rine. - Â¦ .
GERMANS CALL
HIM A FORGER
T^K system- of wireless telegraphy installed by the' New York Herald be
tween Sankaty Head on the island of Nantucket and the Nantucket
lightship out in the ocean forty-three miles away commenced its regular
work yesterday. It is now possible to hear of the ark-oach of inbound
ocean steamers twelve or fourteen hours, before they*reach New York
and to hear of them that long after they have left that harbor.
Most of the regular liners will be equipped with Marconi's apparatus and be
tween these and the Nantucket lightship communication can be had when they
are 100 miles or more farther out In the ocean. -. ' ' â¢ â¢' Â« - ' Â¦
Some months ago the New York Herald, moved, by the success achieved by
The Call in reporting by wireless telegraphy the ap roach of the Sherman with the
First California home bound from Manila in August. 1899, and its own success
with the same system on the occasion of the Columbia-Shamrock races . off
Sandy Hook later in the same year, conceived the idea of making permanent use
of the new system of transmission of .signals in reporting the arrivals and > de
partures of vessels from Nantucket lightship, which rides at anchor forty-three
miles south of Nantucket Island on the northern edge of the "lane" followed by
trans-Atlantic steamers and 166 miles beyond Fire Island, whence such reports
have heretofore come. .--Â«-. , â¢ "Â¦'â¢â¢Â¦
Formal permission was had from the Treasury Department to make use of the
lightship and the plans. for the work thereon'having been perfected and approved
by the lighthouse inspector for the district, the work was begun some weeks ago.'
MAP OF COUNTRY FROM NEW YORK TO NANTUCKET, SHOWING SHIPS AND TELEGRAPH STATIONS.
HEBALD'S OBSERVATION STATION, NANTTTCKET LIGHTSHIP, Aug. 16.-(By Marconi system-of
wireless telegraphy)â Cunard line steamship Lucania, Captain McKay, seventy-two miles east of Nantucket,
sends this message by Marconi wireless telegraphy to the station of inauguration of the Herald's service for
reporting incoming steamships and transporting messages to and from them:
"All well on board. We are 2 87 miles from Sandy Hook and with clear weather expect to reach Njw
York harbor Saturday. Please inform Cunard agents. "McKAT."
NAXTUCKET, Mass., Aug. 16.â Communication by
wireless telegraphy was established between the Nan
tucket lightship and the LucanlaTan Incoming steam
ship of the Cunard line, at 6 o'clock this evening, and
thus In effect many hours were cut from the ocean
voyage between Europe and America. Long before "they sight
ed land the Lucania's passengers were acquainted with the
world's news of the present week.
At the wireless telegraph station the instruments between
5 and 6 o'clock this evening recorded the signals that were
being sent out from the lightship searching for the Lucania.
Finally at about 6 o'clock It was demonstrated that the two
vessels were In communication. To make absolutely certain
the circuit was temporarily broken to ask the lightship if the
L/Ucania had been heard from. The answer came back that the
big Cunarder had been reached. From that time until forty
minutes after 9 o'clock messages were sent in a stream from
the Lucania.
There were occasional Interruptions from adjustment, but
in a general way it may be said that the conditions were favor
able and that communication for /nearly four hours was un
broken.
From the Nantucket lightship to the Lucania was sent a
summary of the news events of the world that had happened
since the steamship left the other side. It is not difficult t to
Imagine the enthusiasm that this aroused among the passen
gers who -were fortunate enough to take part in the inaugura
tion of this new service.
As the Lucania left the shores of Ireland Sunday morning
they were kept In communication with the world ashore by
this still mysterious agency of air until Queenstown had
dropped below the horizon. All were interested in that event.
Â¦which was made complete when communication was taken up
again this evening at a time when the Lucania had nearly twtÂ»
hundred miles of ocean to travel before reaching its pier in
â¢ JCorth River.
Frequent tests made from 8 o'clock in the morning showed
fthat the instruments ashore and aboard the lightship were in
good working order. Communication was maintained easily
and regularly throughout the day and long messages were
exchanged. Among these were final instructions in regard to
the order In which messages from the Lucania should be re
ceived and messages to be sent. 'â¢
British naval officers assert that messages have been sent
this year In the Mediterranean a distance of more than 100 miles
from ship to ship, but this distance is assumed and not estab
lished. In France wireless telegraphy has been used 1 for several
years, the system being that of Lieutenant Tissot. In the Med
iterranean fleet maneuvers this year this Tissot system was
employed, but It'ls reported that at one critical moment in the
tactical evolutions the enemy's message was picked up ! and
utilized by the defending fleet. The Italian navy has success
fully, used the Marconi system for four years, and several sta
tions on the littoral of the peninsula have been equipped.
In commercial shipping also the wireless system Is making
steady progress. Six transatlantic steamships have made use
of It. The American liner St. Paul In 1809 carried a temporary
installation and communicated with a station situated at the
Needles, on the Isle of "Wight. The estimated distance between
ship and station was sixty sea miles.
The Lucania, Deutschland. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, Kal
serln Maria Teresa and Lake Champlain also are fitted- with
the device, which, except in case of the Teresa, is of the Mar
coni type. 'It Is reported that other steamers plying in impor
tant trade waters are to be equipped. The notable success of
the present trial with the Lucania must lead shipowners to
make this installation a part of the regular outfit.
It is often asked if fog, bad weather, or the curvature of
the earth Interferes with the transmission or distinctness of
messages. No other trial than those carried out by the Nan
tucket station Is needed to prove that foe and bad weather
have not even the slightest effect. "The effect of the earth's
curvature is said to be not appreclablo and leaving out mechan
ical faults it seems fairly certain that electrical' conditions of
the atmosphere are/ the only ones that create disturbances and
these are of temporary character.
No one may venture, to predict the future of wireless teleg
raphy. Double transmission by a single wire has been achieved
âthat is, two messages have at the same Instant been sent and
received between Niton, in the Isle of "Wight, and Sand Bank.
This has been brought about by using different wave
lengths for the two messages.
Three important problems still await solution. As yet the
bearing and distance of signaling a ship cannot be determined.
Although promising experiments have been made with mes
sages that can be read by particular receivers if or which
they are intended, definite success cannot be claimed, and this
work remains within the domain of investigation.
Experts are hopeful that the bridging of the Atlantic by
wireless telegraph will soon be'posslble. This will not demand
any increase in the height of the pole, because the limit In
that direction has been nearly reached, nor will the sensibility
of the receiver be increased to any exeat extent. The secret
probably lies In increasing the capacity of the aerial conductor
and employing more electrical epergy for transmission.

LAECHMON'T TACHT CLUB. NEW
YORK, Augr. 16.â The Constitution drifted
across the finish line lato this evening a
winder, over the Columbia by 31 minutes
and 23 seconds. This difference in time\ :
however, does not represent the difference
In speed between the two yachts, for a very
large part of the big margin was entirely
due to a fluke in the light airs while the
boats were sailing: the second round of
the triangular course of fifteen miles.
It occurred just as the Constitution was
rounding the first marje. Both yachts had
come up from the home mark on a broad
reach with a southwest wind, the Consti
tution leadinp bv about two minutes. As
they approached the stakeboat black
clouds which had been gathering In the
northwest brought with them a small
rain squall and sudden change o( wind.
The Constitution was able to turn on the
southwest wind and immediately after
take the northwester, which drifted her
out into th<> middle of the sound, while
the Columbia wai maklnar for the> mark
close hauled on the port tack In the verv
inst wind nf the first' northwest squall.
This srave the Constitution an opportunity
to take advantage of the westerly wind
which followed out In the sound, while
the Columbia lay almost becalmed at the
mark. This settled the race, for there
aftpr the Columbia was out of It. "
The contest of sn*Â»Â«Â»d was al+orethpi* tn
the first round, while the wind, which
was at all times llpht. held as it <Jtd On
every leg the new boat gained. nnd mntn
tain<?fl a reputation as a wonderfully fa.it
yacht in soft airs. But tho Columbia,
with her perfect sa'l*. was also Rolncr
fast, and in the first fifteen miles the new
boat only made up_ twenty seconds over
her time allowance. The met noteworthy
â¢spectator of the race was Cnptaln Svca

SARATOGA. X. Y.. Aus. 1C.-A11 that
poes to make racing successful has at
tended the first week of the Saratoga As
sociation's meeting. Never before in the
history of this famous place have there
been so many people here, and several
days before the date set for the races to
begin it was evident that the prestige ac
cruing to the sport when William C. Whit
ney took over the plant from a gang of
Guttenburg grafters for the. sole reason or
lending it tone and bringing Saratoga
closer to the Jockey Club than it could
ever have been under its old management
was of the most pronounced sort.
Saratoga is different from any other
rourse on which the thoroughbreds meet
In America. Here racing Is essentially
the sport of the rich. There is a notice
able absence of the small fry and piking
outfits, that do nothing on other race
tracks but get in the way. interfere wltn
the business of the ring and make the
grand stands tincomfortable on warm
day?. Every section of the country is rep
resented at the current meeting. Horse
men and bookmakers from California are
chasing the nimble dollars so liberally of
fered by the association with their breth
ren from New York. Of course, the big
guns" of the Metropolitan Bookmakers
Association are in a decided majority. One
would have Imagined himself at Sheeps
fcead Bay on Suburban day from a Kooa
look at the ring. The whole New York
contingent moved bag and baggage to tne
spa when the last race was run at Brigh
ton last Saturday night. Very few of the
best horses remained in Gotham, ana
there is enough in class and numbers in
the stables to make the meeting stand
out most prominently as the greatest this
historic turf center has ever known.
The opening days of the meeting ">una
the talent on top with a big shade. The
layers have had to content themselves
with a succession of bad breaks as sel
dom come together in a few days. They
got a morsel of comfort when Rockton, an
outsider, won the rich Saratoga handi
cap, but the same day Mr. Whitney b
Goldsmith, running for as much money
as any horse in the big race, brought
home the classic Flash stakes and there

smoothing before the bank rolls fatten up
to their original size.
Senator O'Brien and J. W. Schorr fell
hard recently when Hans Wagner fin
ished outside the money in the first race.
The Memphis brewer, and the Minnesota
statesman went to tlie long price about
Hans as if it were a shame to take the
money. That grotesque pot boy. J.
Woods, rode the colt a country fair race
or he might have taken the place. The
winner. Schwalbe. a black filly, bred and
raced by the smiling- Schreiber, will bear
a deal of watching, as she won off by her

meeting until Otis appeared. He Is a son
of Imported Meddler, out of the old Lor
illard mare Klldeer. one of the fastest
ever in training. An idea of Goldsmith's
ouallty was had when he won the Flash

ouarter he was sixth, pinned on the rail
and apparently hopelessly beaten. Tur

Saratoga Club and do dire things to Rich

hsve given the boss gambler a deal of
trouble and tied him up for the ne.xt
Grr.nd Jury to untie, but the little Ivory

of a raoo horse to do anything with him
during the rest of the season. TJnfortu
nn<*ly. not- knowing what the flrst crop
of Ssin's sret would amount to. Fchreiber
failed to nominate him for the "Futurity,
which he would assuredlv have a grand
chance of landing could he start. Some
doubt exists whether Otis is by Sain or
by imp. Foul Rhot. As all of the colts
sent frcir* the Missouri farm as represen
tatives of Sain have won and. moreover,
sriven evidence of being in the first class,
it in onlv reasonable to.infÂ«r that Otis is
a son of Sain. The Foul Shot horgp* aro

Quite a contest between August Bel

over John Bullman's services when it was
known he would not ride under his con

though the terms of the contract were
not announced. Mounce, the Idaho light

on the Pacific Coast and came East to

to his California reputation, and was re
leased bv the Jockey Club's president as

Full of features was the baseball game
at Recreation- grounds, yesterday after
noon. The Los Angeles team, confident
and boastful, met disaster to .the sad
music of C-4, Jones" was riddled in one
Inning almost beyond repair, Householder
and Schwartz engaged In a bit of rowdy
ism, the ball went oyer -the center field
fence' and Rube Levy was alternately
good and bad without any particular
manifestation of favoritism. The crowd
enjoyed Itself thoroughly, cackling and
shouting all the time. . . ',
Hank Harris, who has a reputation for
running a team on bedrock prices, was
there with his two pitchers; Iburg j and
Whalen. The latter was in the box and
came off with a record of ten hits against
his. name. The locals fell on Jones, Nor
dyke opening the fire by losing the ball
over the center field fence with a drive
that seemed as if it would never end. It
was perhaps the longest 'ever .made on
the grounds. This hapDened-in the third
inning, and before the Wasps took to the
field the scorer rang, six bells and regis
tered six hits in their favor. Jones was
fairly slaughtered. Out of the six hits
one was for a, home run and another for
three bags. The run-getting stopped with
this inning, but the local team kept right
along in its swatting career. ,
In the sixth the Angels had a chance to
redeem - themselves and return to
heaven. Then Whalen " suffered. The
Angels added up four .runs and
four hits â¢before " the Inning was
over. For a time it looked as if
the score would be tied, but death came
before this could be accomplished. Uncle
Henry gesticulated in a frenzied sort of
way when the Los Angeles stickers were
rapping the spheroid.' and even went so
far as to think whether it would not be
financially painful to hire another pitcher
to help out Iburg and Whalen during the
season. The score: "

agers of the fighters "are anxious for a
date at which the strike will be settled

At a meeting last night .between De
laney and Madden, who arrived yesterday
forenoon with Ruhlin and "Denver Ed
Martin, an agreement was reached to
sign articles on Tuesday afternoon or
next week at Harry Corbett's. The ar
ticles of agreement will be practically the
same as those drawn up for the "meeting
which was scheduled to take place at
Cincinnati, and which was so sadly inter
fered with by the Governor of Ohio.
Madden and Delaney have gone even
as far as the selection of a referee. Both
are satisfied to accept George Slier as

insert hi* name in the referee clause of
the articles. . _

Captain Wittman has stationed a police
man at every corner from Market street
to Bryant and from Third street to Sixth.
Their instructions are to see that the non
union drivers and the special officers are
not molested. As soon as a non-union
driver appears with h!s team he is met
by a policeman and escorted to the next
block, Â¦where he is turned over to another
officer. All along the street the sama
methods are pursued until the driver
reaches his destination and gets a receipt
for his goods. By these means the police
hope to prevent any attempt to injure the
nc-R- union drivers while they are deliver
ing a load.
The regular police officers who were
taken off the wagons were yesterday as
signed to duty along the principal streets

John Twedale, who was given a spe

signed principally to Curtln's Detective
Agency.
J. B. Murtha, who was appointed a spe

The retail grocers agreed to Interview
the strike, leaders and ascertain if they
would not consent .to some modification
of their demands as sent to the Employ
ers' Association. -While no radical modi

concerned. .
The matter of securing the consent of

THE Iron Trades Council
adopted a resolution yester
day afternoon protesting em
phatically against the em
ploying of policemen as
guards for non-union teamsters.
The resolution Is as follows:
"Whereas, Since organized labor and
organized capital have been contending
for certain principles, that each party
in its wisdom deems of vital import
ance to its -existence and riirbts; and
whereas, organized labor on its port
has made a peaceable fight and at all
times has kept within tha bounds of
the laws of j the country, simply exer
cising such rights and privileges as
belong to any citizen at any and all
times; and whereas, the employers on
their part have utterly disregarded all
laws, usurped the powers of the city
government to the extent of demand
lne the use of the entire police force
for their special arid sole use as driv
ers of trucks, to create and promul
gate riots uboh the least pretext or
opportunity, to obstruct the free use
cf public streets and thoroughfares
and to shoot, club and intimidate citi
zens and taxpayers: they have also
openly violated the laws of the city
charter by swearing in as police (spe
cial) men who are not citizens or tax
payers of the city; men who are ex
convicts and disorderly characters,
who .->re a menace to the peace and
welfare, of the city in general; and
whereas, the Mayor and other city
officials have violated their oaths of
office In permitting these open ' vio
r latlons of the law and are willingly
lending their official aid to assist a
small wealthy combination of capital
ists to override and tyrannize every
citizen of the city, be he or not inter
â¬&ted in this controversy; __ therefore
be it /
Resolved, By the machinists in regu
lar session assembled that we as a
body of men 1700 strong and mostly
voters of the city of San FrancUco
do hereby protest most emphatically
azainst this â¢ usurpation of our rights
and privileges as citizens: that we
condemn the action taken by the city
officials in their un-American discharge
of their duties; and be it further
Itesolved, That we now and here
after pledge ourselves to vote for none
but union men of unimueachable ln
tejjrity and character to fill every of
fice in the gift of the people, who will
discharge their duties for the protec
tion of the whole people.

ITS PROTEST

H. J. Smith and Special Officers J. E.
Wheaton and W. H. Waite testified to the
crowd of strikers being on East street and
to having seen Knight hit' Maddison ! on
the back with his club. Knight testified
that Maddison' was the only one in the
crowd who did not move on and he hit
him on the back and shoulder. -Maddison
grabbed hold of him and called him an
offensive name. If his club had caused
the wound on Maddison's head it . must
have been by a glancing blow. The case
was continued till this morning so that
the physicians who attended Maddison
could be present and testify.
NEW YORK, Aug. 16.â It was an
nownced to-day at the headquarters of the
Shirt Makers'. Union that 1000 glrls^ would
be ordered to strike to-morrow. The union
says this order is the first of many unless
wages axe raised.

President Believes That More Mills
PITTSBURG. Aug. 16.â "The spread of
the strike." said President Shaffer to
night, "has not surprised me. It la not
even up to my expectations. By this I
do' not mean that I am disappointed by
the way the men have come ouf. but I
am certain that more will come out in a
short time. All those who are out are
going to stay out, too. There is no rea
son for believing that the men in Mc-
Keesport will break away from their
present position, in spite of the stories
to the contrary. Other mills will be
closed before many days and the spread
of. the strike will go on with the same
regularity that has characterized It in
the past."
In reply to queries regarding the re
ports received from Assistant Seeretaiy
TIerhe. now fn Milwaukee, Shaffer said:
"I do not look for any statement from
Mr. Tighe until he returns home. He will
be too busy while on his trip to devote
PITTSBURG. Aug. 16.â A dispatch from
McKeesport says the strikers expect the
Duquesne plant of the Carnegie Steel
Company will be out in three days. They
say It Is organized and is waiting to co
operate with Homestead and Braddock
mills 1 " and that this is the trump card
President Shaffer has been holding. Trou
ble is expected if men are imported or any
other men return to work.
The tube welders published an an
nouncement to-day that they will Join no
union, but will remain out'while the strike
is on. Mayor Black refused permission to
the Socialist Labor party to hold a street
meeting. The Mayor also refused permis
sion to the strikers to hold a twenty
round fight between Jack McClelland and
M. Donovan for the benefit of ; < the strike

Shaffer Said to Have Called Out
The statement closes with an assertion
that one year ago the Amalgamated men
refused aid in settling the scale and that
at Connellsville and Cleveland the Amal
gamated men 'aided the company in filling
the places of striking tin plate workers.
PREPARING A TRUMP CARD.
"Finding at that time that the Interests
of the tinhouse men^were identical with
the members of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation we solicited Shaffer to enter Into
a defensive alliance to strengthen the po
sition of both organizations in trades dis
putes. Shaffer objected. He told us that
the Amalgamated Association stood for
the observance of its contracts and thit
it could not enter into any defensive com
pact which would obligate the association
to violate either the spirit or the letter
of Its signed agreements. He said he could
only promise the 'moral and financial' aid
provided in the laws of the American Fed
eration of fcabor, for which he acted when
he organized the tinhouse employes. We
finally got our scale adopted without any
assistance from the Amalgamated Asso
ciation."
PITTSBURG. Aug. 16.â A lengthy state
ment on behalf of the tin workers, made
public to-day, reviews the history of the
organization after the American Federa

STATEMENT BY TINWORKERS.
MILWAUKEE. Wls.. Aug. 16.â The
members of the Bayview Lodge of the
Amalgamated Association of Iron. Steel
and Tin Workers will to-morrow decide
for a second time whether or not they
will obey the strike order of President
Shaffer. M. F. Tighe, rf presenting Presi
dent Shaffer, accompanied by W. C. Da
vis, vice president of the fourth district
of the Amalgamated Association, reached
Milwaukee this afternoon, but not until
late to-night did he have a conference
with President Redfern of the local lodge
relative to the date of the meeting.
As time goes on the chances seem to
.favar a strike, the sentiment In that di
rection seeming to have gained strength
Finoe the men at Joliet decided to go out.
There are, however, many conservative
members of the Bayview Lodge who favor
remaining at work. These tÂ»re men who
have gone through strikes heretofore and
before another step Is taken the question
â¢will be weighed very carefully. Should
the men decide to remain at work and
should Tighe declare their charters re
voked the matter will be taken to the
next national convention for settlement.
Old members of the association say that
President Shaffer in calling the strike
acted illegally and violated the constitu
tion and further that a charter cannot be
revoked without a hearing before the dis
trict board.
Superintendent George Rels of the Illi
nois Steel Company's plant fn this city
says lhat in case the men remain at work
and the lodge's charter is revoked
his company will agrea to pÂ«y the scale
the same as has been signed, and, furth
ermore, that if the men lose their charter
the *eale v.-ill be signed with the men as
individuals. The r-ituaiion Is grave. If
Jollet had continued- 3t work the Bay
view men would undoubtedly have fol
lowed their example, but since the Joliet
lodge changed front it would not be sur
prising if Milwaukee should take the same
courfce " .
Decision for Action on the Strike
Order Expected To-Day.
BAYVIEW LODGE XRTC^RTATN.
Two hundred men employed in the Na
tional Galvanizing Works of the National
Tube Company at McKeesport struck to
day. They were the last remaining work
men in the affected trades in that city,
and the tie-up is now as complete as
possible there. Many of the tube work
ers, although on strike, have refused to
join any union, and the opinion is ex
pressed, that there will soon be a break
among the strikers.
The leaders plan another rally for to
morrow night to re-enthuse men and
check any break that may be impending.
The organizers are working bard to keep
the men in line. They are also extending
their operations to Duquesne and Home
stead, the two great strongholds of the
Carnegie Company, and claim to be gain
ing ground at both places. The recent
gains here and at Joliet will bring the to
tal number of men brought out by the
third and final call of President Shaffer
to about 30,000 and press the grand total
to something over 70.000 men. Thousands
of the men out have found other work,
and the exact number now idle is un
known. The- Amalagamated Association
is organizing a series of employment bu
reaus, and plans to place many more of
the idle men. President Shaffer announced
to-day that after September 1 idle Amal
gamated men would receive strike bene
fits of $4 a week apiece, and that some
provision would be made for men outside
the organization.
Welisvilie. Hyde Park. Painter's,
Clark's. Lindsay & MeCutcheon's and the
Crescent Works, the six properties open
ed partly or in full with non-union men
rince the strike began, moved along to
day as usual. Another orew has been
secured for Pointer's mill. The other
Ignited States Steel properties unaffected
by th?. strike were also running without
interruption. President Shaffer and all of
his official associates except Assistant
Secretary Tighe were at the strike head
quarters, where a series cf conferences
were held during the day.
PITTSBURG, Pa_, Aug. 16.â The center
of interest in the steel strike to-day shift
ed to the West, where Jollet finally swung
Into line with the strikers, and Milwau
kee appointed to-morrow as the time for a
final vote on the subject.
The news that came out of the "West
cheered the strikers throughout the dis
tricts In this vicinity as no other develop
ment since the labor war was declared.
In their enthusiasm they count on favor
able action at Milwaukee to-morrow and
carrying their hopes still further they say
they will yet win Chicago over. These suc
cesses, they declare, with apparent con
fidence, will make them masters of the
situation and win the strike.
The steel operators, on the other hand,
cay the strikers are nearly at the flood tide
of their success and that when the ebb
comes it can never bi stopped.' They do
not seem to be disturbed by recent events
and with a confidence equal to that of the
strikers talk of the certainty of ultimate
success. They assert that popular senti
ment has never been behind the strikers,
and that the interest which was once
aroused by the contest is quickly waning.
They say they are more than holding
their own in the non-union plants that
Â¦were unaffected or have been started
since the strike began, and are perfecting
plans for reopening several plants now
Idle. They also say that many of their
men, particularly at McKeesport, Wheel
ing and Bellaire, were forced out by in
timidation and will come tack as soon
as the excitement dies out and their
safety is assured. Talk of peace has been
dropped fer the time being, and it is
agreed that in this present aspect the sit
uation indicates a prolonged and stubborn
contest.
More Employes on Strike.
Steel Operators Say They
Are Still Holding Their
Own.
any time to making reports. We will
know more about the feeling of the men
in the West, when a direct statement is
made from him. Any breach of the peace
that has thus far taken place since the
strike began has not come from us. but
from the other side. We have obeyed all
laws and counseled peaceful means in
the conduct of the strike. If the trust
continues to openly transgress the law
as it does in Monessen we cannot be held
responsible for the consequences."
Shaffer then went on to describe how
the Amalgamated men had had every in
ducement to riot and resisted the tempta
tion. In one or two instances the mat
ter had been referred to the authorities
In concluding this statement President
Shaffer said that he would always en
deavor to carry on this strike with per
fect regard for all laws. It had been
conspicuous for this reason thus far and
the Amalgamated Association intended
to show the people that the steel workers
were perfectly capable of handling the
contest, legally.
The strike leaders are confident that the
mgmbers of the Emnloyers' | Association
are beginning to yield to the tremendous
pressure brought to bear against them by
local merchants, whose business is suffer
ing greatly by reason of the strike. They
argue that the retailers are their allies
and that the complaints of these trades
men cannot longer be ignored by the
wholesalers, who in their turn are urging
the members of the association to end
Mr. Rothschild subsequently stated that
the declination of the association to ap
point a committee had nothing to do with
the secret project now under considera
tion. A similar statement was made by
Dr. Salfield and other members of the
committee.
There was no discussion of any kind.
Ex-United States Senator Charles Felton
was in attendance, but the request of the
chair for remarks from him was courte
ously declined. Mr. Felton said he had
come to listen, and not to have others
listen to him. The meeting, after empow
ering the executive committee to act at
its pleasure in matters affecting the set
tlement of the strike, then adjourned.
"We have learned something highly im
portant," he said, "but it would not do
to discuss It here. This meeting -should
never have been called."
This letter was read at the meeting of
the committee of one hundred at 1605 Polk
street last night. Chairman Rothschild
told of what had been done by the com
mittee in the interest of peace, but he
made no reference to his conference with
Attorney Michael. Mr. Barnes said that
the situation in view of Attorney Mich
ael's letter did not require discussion.
Kxecutive Committee of One Hundredâ Dear
Sirs: I am instructed by the executive com
mittee of the Employe! sÂ° Association to ad
vise you that they have had under considera
tion your communication of August 14, and
while .they lully appreciate your good offices
in the matter, they are of the opinion that the
plan for a conference as suggested in your let
ter is not under present conditions advisable.
Very truly yours, M. F. MICHAEL.
During the afternoon there was a meet
ing of tne executive committee of the as
sociation, as the following letter received
by Attorney Kothschild at 6 o'clock indi
cates:
SAX FRANCISCO. Aug. 16. 1901.
"Has any committee been appointed to
discuss the situation with a. committee
from the Federation of Improvement
Clubs?"
""There has not."
No Committee of Eight. .
"The situation is just as it was three
weeks ago," he said, '^Tiie Employers'
Association has expressed its views and
there is nothing to add thereto." Â¦
"How about your consultation 7,1th At
torney Rothschild at noon?"
"I nave nothing to say," was the de
cisive answer.
p^ri-sa HE first ray of sunshine to break
I through the gloom precipitated
I by the strike, indicating that the
il present situation is not absolutely
hopeless, presented itself at noon
yesterday, when M. F. Michael, counsel
for the Employers' Association,'consent
ed to meet Joseph Rothschild of the com
nilttee of one hundred of the Federation
of Improvement Clubs. After'a long con
sultation the two attorneys separated un
der a mutual pledge exacted by Attorney
Michael that the result of the conference
would not be divulged under any circum
stances "until the matter under consider
ation was in perfect shape to make pub
lic."
"I am not at liberty to say anything at
this time," said Attorney Rothschild after
the meeting. "I will make the admission,
however, that since my talk with Mr.
Michael f am more hopeful of an early
settlement of the strike. Until a certain
affair of importance has developed more
fully neither Mr. Michael nor myself is
privileged to discuss the * subject of our
conference." t "/
"is it probable that the Employers' As
sociation will consent to appoint a com
mittee to confer with committees of the
feueration of Improvement Clubs ana
the strikers?" was asked.
"I think so," was the reply.
When Attorney Michael was asked if
there was anytning new relative to the
attitude of the association toward the
committee of one hundred he replied in
the negative..

Does not depend on the start but on the
finish. It's staying power which carries
many a runner to victory.- It's like that
in business. Many a man starts off in
the race for business success with a
burst of speed which seems to assure
victory. Presently be begins to falter
and at last he falls and fails. The cause?
Generally w stomach trouble." No man
is stronger . than his stomach. Business
haste leads to careless and irregular eat-
ing. The stomach and other organs of
digestion and nutrition become diseased.
The body is inadequately nourished and !
so grows weak.
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
cures diseases of the stomach and other
organs of digestion and nutrition. It
strengthens the stomach and so strength-
ens the whole body which . depends on
the stomach ' for / the nourishment from

Republicans, however, have not been content with 1
exposing the humbug of the State issue raised by the
Democrats. "They have in their platform declared the
real- nature of the issues that confront the people
of Maryland.' The State and also the city of Balti
more have long been under the domination of politi-,
cal bosses, one of ..whom and the chief is, Arthur Pue-
Gorman himself. Another, prominent member of -the
gang is a Baltimore boss named Rasin. Â¦ The'Repub-
MARYLAND Republicans have met the Dem-,
ocrats of that State fairly upon the issue
chosen by the Democrats themselves. Since
Mr. Gorman induced his party to ignore not only
Bryan but all national issues as well and to ask sup
port of the people upon State issues only, the Re
publicans have consented to waive every advantage
of the prestige of the party in national affairs and
have started out to meet their opponents on the
ground chosen by themselves.
About the only State issue the Democratic* con
vention could conjure up was that of suppressing the
colored vote. They have raised the cry that Maryland
is in danger of negro domination and that all white
men should vote the Democratic ticket in order to
secure a white man's government. It is on that'plat
form and with that sort of a campaign argument they
are now seeking to capture the State that they may
return Gorman to the United States Senate...
That the cry of negro domination in Maryland is
but a bugaboo has been convincingly shown by Mr.
Goldsborough, chairman of the Republican State
Central Committee. In a recent statement he says:
"The suggestion that the more than 80 per cent of
white population^ the- State is in jeopardy, from any
standpoint, from the less than 20 per cent of negro*
population is an insult to a brave and intelligent peo
ple. ,. There has never been a time when there was not
a white man's government in Maryland, and as "the.
percentage of colored people has steadily, decreased
each decade since 1810, when it was 38.22 per cent, to
(the present time," when it is but 1978 per cent, the
puerility and absurdity of crying aloud for a white
man's' government are apparent."

hardly anything that we do not produce in our own
country. Without American corn and wheat and
meat products the German people "would fare much
worse than they do, while were we to lose the bulk
of our imports from Germany our- working^people
would hardly know it.
The statement of :he bureau goes on to say: "On
the export side the greatest growth has been during
the last five j-ears, in which time our exports to
Germany have doubled, being in 1896 ; $97,897,197,
and in 1001 $191,072,252. The growth is distributed
among a large number of articles. Comparing our
exports to Germany in 1895 with those of 1001, corn
has increased from $1,672,539 in 1895 to $17,305,229 in
1901; wheat, from $1,522,736 to $7,871,573; lard,
from $8,018,516 to $13,700,875; oil cake and oil cake
meal, from $2,339,885 to $5,242,624; flour, from $740,
264 to $2,011,259; agricultural implements, from
$556,914 to $2,677,319; and copper, from $1,604,390
in 1895 to $7,785,496 in 1901. Machinery of all kinds,
including steam engines, increased from $1,595,135 in
1895 to $8,109,095 in 1900, the figures for 1001 in this
item being not yet available. On the import side the
articles which show the greatest growth during the
last decade are coal tar colors and dyes, chemicals,
laces and embroideries, earthen, stone and china ware
and sugar. Coal tar colors and dyes have increased
from $1,272,275 in 1891 to $3,822,162 in 1900; other
chemicals, from $1,368,988 to $3,068,116; laces and
embroideries, from $945,186 to $2,402,372; earthen,
stone and china ware, from $1,475,057 to $2,787,163;
snd sugar, from $7,209,150 to $12,346,734."
The figures show that imports into the United
States from Germany have increased from $27,000,
000 in 1870 to $100,000,000 in 1901, and that our ex
ports to that country during the same period have in
creased from $42,000,000 to $191,000,000. Thus there
has been an increase of nearly 300 per cent in the
value of imports from Germany and of nearly 400
per cent in the value of our exports.
j-~i OR a number of years past there has been more
l~~< or less friction in our commercial dealings with
Â¦*Â¦ Germany. **Ve have had occasion more than
once to complain of an unfair treatment of our agri
cultural products sent to that,- country, while the
Germans, on the other hand, have not failed toÂ»find
some cause of complaining of us. The recent draft
of a new tariff in Germany has given . additional
"vigor to the discussion of the trade relations of the
two countries, and accordingly there will be a good
deal of interest in the recently published bulletin of
the Treasury Bureau of Statistics showing the growth
of the conimerce of the two countries during the
last thirty years.
OUR TRADE "WITH GERMANY.
f. From that statement it appears Mr. Depew has his
Senatorship on his brain. He retires from the field
of interviewing because he deems the old sport in
consistent with his new dignity. It is sad to have to
exchange a unique master of the. art of being inter
viewed for. a very prosy Senator, but the country
must bear its fate. .
Some light upon the question is thrown by further
remarks of the Senator in the same conversation in
which he announced his retirement. For example,
he is reported to have -said: "As a United States
Senator I am precluded from discussing Lord Kitch
ener's proclamation. I presume*, Mr. Balfour and
Mr. Chamberlain will enlighten us on the subject
when they, speak at Blenheim, and it would - have
been a pleasure to rrie to be near them and witness
the demonstration at the Duke of Marlborough's
charming, palace had I not thought my. presence there
would' be misconstrued in the United States."
Senator Depew attributes his decision to retire to
the fact that his sayings and speeches have been
erroneously reported ever since he has been in Eu
rope. That, however, cannot be the real reason.
The Senator is enough of a logician to know that the
misrepresentation of his words by reporters in Eu
rope affords no valid ground for refusing to be in
terviewed by reporters in New' York, or Chicago.
The Senator's retirement, then, must be due to
causes oth'er than that which he gave, and the suf
fering public has an. interest in knowing what they
are. ... â¢ ' â¢
Depew interviews have been a part of the lighter
reading of American people for the whole of this
generation. There was no topic of the time they
did not touch and they ' touched nothing without
telling a pleasant anecdote. That the anecdote was not
always relevant to the theme and never at any time
pointed a moral did not detract from the agreeable
ness of vrtiat he said, or at least permitted the re
porter to say for him. To have no more such inter
views will be a loss both to the passing and to the
arriving generation. The one will miss something
for which it lrad acquired a taste and a longing,
while the other will never have an opportunity to
study the interview as' a fine art and learn how to
say nothing in such a way that none but an expert
could find out that nothing had been said.
That the American people will receive this an
nouncement with regret goes without saying. Had
Depevv determined to retire from the Senate no one
would have cared, for we do not know him as a
Senator; had he decided to retire from business the
country would not lament, or even were he. to aban
don the habit of after-dinner oratory there would be
no mourning, for the world is now familiar with his
style of "piling story on story" and there are plenty
of younger men who can take his place. It is dif
ferent, however, with his retirement from the field
of the interviewer. There is no one in the whole
wide world to take his place' as a purveyor of inter
views for space fillers on every subject from the way
to solve the Chinese question to "what I would do if
I were to be born again."
SENATOR DEPEW recently announced in
London: "I am going to retire from the inter
viewing business permanently. I have served
my full, time and generally have enjoyed it; but
there have been so. many,, fictitious and erroneous re-,
ports of my sayings and speeches since I have ar
rived in- Europe this summer that I have determined
to, give "up the job.*' â¢

It must in fairness be said that the Virginia poli
ticians are like their kind everywhere. They shy
and cry out about diseases in the body politic, but
are the last to vaccinate against them.. Just now
the Democratic politicians are badly in need of a
grievance. They find it in the justifiable public soli
citude over the aggregation of capital. That solici
tude will work out finally in the protection of in
dividual rights. This will be done by the enforce
ment of existing law, not by politicians, but by men
whose rights are imperiled. If such enforcement
demonstrate. the insufficiency of the law, it will be re
inforced. A very large number of existing combina
tions are destined 1 to fail because of inherent infirmi
ties. The watering of their stock is an infirmity that
is sure to cause disaster. When our fat years are
followed by lean ones, as they will be, such combina
tions will find their fictitious value shrinking down
to their real | foundation, and even that crumbling
under them. In. theend whatever is beneficial to the
people and the country's~commerce in the trusts will
survive, and what is noxious will perish.
The cold truth is that any man anywhere in the
United States can invoke existing law. If the Demo
crats of Virginia think there is not law enough their
Legislature can make more. It can outlaw trusts in
that commonwealth. It can refuse the benefit of its
collection laws to all articles imported there by
trusts. It can make illegal the collection of a bill
for powder, tin, steel, whisky and even for the- kero
sene oil used in burning negroes at the stake. It
can even make the sale of trust goods criminal and
prosecute to fine and jail the agents, drummers and
other representatives of trusts, and can make it a
criminal offense for 3 merchant to have in his pos
session and offer for sale the products of a trust.
Virginia has a quiver full of arrows for the criminal
trusts and illegal combinations of capital, but in
stead of using them she prefers to bluster and draw
an empty bow, for political effect.
The only Federal statute on the subject was
drawn by John Sherman, a Republican Senator from
Ohio.
Then why arraign the Republican party for a fail
ure to enforce existing law? Virginia is a Demo
cratic State. That party controls the executive, leg
islative and judicial branches of the State govern
ment. The presence of a criminal trust in that State,
as a buyer or seller, subjects it to Virginia law. Is
the Republican party responsible for failure to en
force the laws of Virginia in the Democratic courts
of that State? The civil law of Virginia is ready to
be invoked against illegal combinations. Why is it
not put in action? Do the Virginia Democrats in
tend to be understood as saying that only Republi
cans or the Republican party is charged with the en
forcement of existing law? The courts are open
everywhere, to any citizen who desires to rebuke the
violation of law. The Democratic .party was in
power in the National Government and a majority of
the States for eight years. At that time the oil and
whisky trusts and others were in existence. Accord
ing to the Virginia plank the Democratic party was
arraignable for failure to enforce existing law and to
enact laws against the trusts.
A motion for, a" bill of particulars would confuse
the makers of that plank. What is a. criminal trust,
and what is an illegal combination of capital? To
be criminal an act must be obnoxious to existing
criminal law. To be illegal a combination of capital
must violate aij existing civil statute. In either case
any citizen can invoke the law against that which
is criminal and that which is illegal."
THE Virginia Democrats cut loose from Bryan
and let loose on trusts. Their trust plank has
that delightful indefiniteness % which politicians
manage so well.' In full 'it reads: "We declare. un :
alterable opposition to the criminal trusts and to
every illegal combination of capital. We denounce
such trusts as a serious menace to public welfare, re
stricting the opportunities and absorbing the-sub
stance of the people. They are the direct product
of partial and unjust legislation, and a reckless mul
tiplication of corporations without suitable provisions
for their control. The rights of American freemen
must not be sacrificed in the interests of corporations
banded together for their destruction. We arraign
the Republican party for both its failure to enforce
existing laws and to enact laws against the trusts."

That is the true purport and meaning of the State
issues in. Maryland this year, and when the votes are
counted after election day it is probable Mr. Gorman
will have reason to be sorry that he said anything
about State affairs at all.
That, then, is the issue that confronts the voters of
Maryland. It is not a question of dornjnation by the
colored vote but of domination by bosses who are
seeking" to suppress the colored vote and to nullify,
that of respectable white men. In fact, as the Bal
timore News puts it, the question is: "Shall the fruits
of twenty years of reform agitation, culminating in
the'great popular victory of 1895 over ring rule, be
surrendered? Shall we go back to the. domination
which for so long a period stifled all honest political
life and made corruption, fraud and subjection to boss
dictation seem the only possible condition . of 'public
affairs in the State of Maryland and. the city of Bal
timore?" â¢
Another ringing plank of the platform says: "We
appeal to all good citizens to unite in defeating the
selfish political bosses in their conspiracy, -begun with
the extra session to perpetuate themselves and their
methods, by one-sided elections, and to thwart the
first purpose of that conspiracy by defeating the elec
tion to the United States Senate of the Democratic
leader who dictated the disfranchising election law to
a servile Assembly. If we succeed we will defeat the
election to the United States .Senate of a man whose
views on tariff and finance fluctuate with political
exigencies, who is stable only in unvarying control of
the * Democratic party machine. If ; we succeed we
will forever destroy the power of that Democratic
city boss who, beyond the average span of human
life, has made legislation and controlled Baltimore
politics for revenue only." â¢
lican platform deals with these men directly. In one
plank it says: "The Republican party compelled offi
cials of the.'Gorman-Rasin administrations - to dis
gorge public moneys and collected public dues from
long exempted corporations. The Republican party,
promises that our unconstitutional election law shall
be* repealed, so that every male citizen in. Maryland
having the. qualifications prescribed by the constitu
tion shall have the right of suffrage." !

Superintendent of Schools Webster Is of
the opinion that the new plan of electing
teachers adopted by the Board of Edu
cation is an "elastic" affair and exposes
the department to political and personal
influences. Webster believes that instead
of awarding credits for, experience, exam
inations only should be held and the pa
pers marked accordingly. .
"If the merit system Is to be carried
out." said Webster yesterday, "it is un
fair to allow at the beginning a certain
percentage of credits for experience.
Again, the only safeguard after the suc
cessful * candidates, in the three classes
have been listed is to select them chrono
logically for appointment. I would con
sider that as a partial preventive of favor
itism. Should the board draw from the list
at > its own discretion the order of merit
will not count."
Webster Says Plan Is Political.
As Consul Coney is to be the honorary
president of the day at one celebration
and Colonel Juan Guillermo Reed is to
fill a similar position at the other some
of the Mexican residents profess to see in
this the cause of certain strained rela
tions between the consular and military
representatives of our sister republic.
"What the Minister of War says is
enough for me," concluded Consul Coney.
Reed says he comes from an old Mex
ican family and that in his country his
name is pronounced Ray-ed. Although
but nine months in the United States he
speaks English, but with a slight Span
ish accent. He claim* to be proficient in
French and Italian.
When the attention of Consul Coney
was called to the documents in the pos
session of Reed he said he had never seen
them and that Reed had never offered to
show them.
During his stay here Colonel Reed has
been following his profession as architect,
a modest sign bearing the inscription,
"John Wm. Reed, architect," standing in
one corner of the dining-room.
"This man called on me a couple, of
months ago," said Consul Coney last
night, "and introduced himself as a col
onel in the Mexican army. He did not
show me any 'credentials. I telegraphed
to the Minister of "War 'and he replied
that there was no such name on the
roster of the Mexican army. If anybody
ought to know if Reed was a colonel in
the Mexicati army the Minister surely
ought to." Â¦
Colonel Reed, bereft of his military
trapping, is a mild-manne'red man, his ap
pearance reminding one of a militia col
onel In every day attire. He freely tells
his story. He does not brag about his
achievements, but points to his many evi
dences of careful study and the war maps
drawn by him as proof of the truth of
his statements.
"I am a native born Mfexican," he said,
and have been educated In Mexico's
schools, taking my final course in the
state military school. I graduated with
honors, as these diplomas and medals
show. I made all branches of engineering
a special study and was given a commis
sion as Instructor. I am a native of
Guadalajara, but received my education
mainly In the city of Mexico.
"My first experience In the field was
against the Yaquis, about eight years ago
in Monterey. I constructed the defenses
which the Indians failed to take. I was
then made first captain of engineers and
since that time I have been steadily pro
moted. My last engagement was under
General Martinez against the Maya In
dians in Yucatan. I served a year and a
half, constructing railroads and military
defenses there. About' nine months ago
I secured a year's leave of absence and
came to this city to place my children in
school. I will return to the military
school in Chapultepec about the middle of
October, when my leave of absence will
expire." Â¦
Colonel Reed, who lives In a comfortable
house on Eddy street, near L&rkin, has
a frame full of diplomas certifying to his
proficiency as a typographer and architect
from the Government military school at
Cnepultepec. He has a breast load of
medals won in school ,and others won on
the field by conspicuous bravery. He has
a- wall. full of military drawings, all bear
ing the official seal of the Government of
Mexico, signed and countersigned by
numerous comandantes and generales.
Yet Consul Coney'says Reed's name is not
on the roster of the army of. Mexico. -He
says he has the authority of the Minister
of War for the statement. <i ,
From the latter side comes the state
ment that Colonel Juan Guillermo Reed
is not a Mexican colonel, that his name is
not on the roster of the Mexican army,
or anywhere else to show that he is en
titled to wear shoulder straps, aigrettes
or anything that goes to make up tha
panoply of war in which the Mexican offi
cer is wont to fight the battles of his
country.
One of those internecine disputes in the
Mexican colony over the celebration' cf
the anniversary' of Mexico's independence
is on once more. While this annual fiesta
generally provokes more or less bitterness
in the colony this year the feeling has
reached an acute stage. On one side is
the Hidalgo Club celebration, scheduled
for September 15, with Colonel Juan Gull
lenmo Reed at the head. On the othor
side is Consul A. K. Coney and the clien
tele that affects an acquaintance with the
local consular diplomatic body.

Cjullle River. Yesterday she came back
into port short of provisions and water,
having failed to reach her destination.
About three weeks ago the schooner was
Broken _away below San Francisco, and
Captain Jacobson then reported that he
could make no headway against the light
contrary winds and calms. A week later
all- hands- were on short allowance and
several days ago ! the men Â¦were reduced
to catching seagulls, out of which they
made soup to eke out their scanty fare.
"We were four times off Coquille Riv
er." said Captain Jacobson yesterday,
"and we could not get in. For days wa
would beat up against an adverse breeze
and then when we thought a change for
the better would come it would fall light
and we would drift back to our starting
pcint. Once we were away below San
Francisco, but managed to get up- to a
point off Coquille again, only once more
to drift back. Finally, when air our pro
visions were nearly gone, I decided to put
back to San Francisco, and here we are.
A tight of nearly six weeks against baf

PARADE IN TACOMA
United States gunboat Ben-
I nington arrived from Manila, via
I China, Japan and Hawaii, yester-
H. day morning and the battleship
Iowa got in from Puget Sound
during the afternoon, while the
cruiser Philadelphia went to the
Mare Island Navy Yard to get
ready for a cruise as far south ' as
Panama. The Philadelphia probably will
be held at the isthmus during the Colom
bian-Venezuelan trouble, while, the Iowa
will rentain here in readiness to join her
should it become necessary. The gunboat
Petrel is also here, and that makes four
warships now in port. The Philadelphia
and Iowa are in first class order and
ready for any emergency, but the Ben
nlngton and Petrel have been a long time
without an overhauling and will not be
sent to sea again unless in a case of abso
lute necessity.
The gunboat Bennington has been al
most constantly in commission for ten
years. She left here for the Philippines
in April, 1S99. On her way down she made
a stop at Honolulu, and it was there
learned that the British proposed annex
ing Wake Island to use it as a landing
place for its Pacific cable. The Benning-
I ton got there first, however, and Wake
Island was annexed to the United States.
From Wake Island the gunboat went to
Guam and thence to Manila. During her
] stay at the islands she was used in pa
trolling the coast and looking out for pi-
I rates and smugglers.
It was while engaged in patrol duty that
the Bennlngton's crew had its first brush
with the natives. Lieutenant Emory Win
ship and several of the men were wound
ed during the affair. The main body of
the crew was sent ashore near Malabon
for observation purposes and was am
bushed near a convent. When the sound
of the firing reached the gunboat she was
run close inshore and the woods were
shelled. This drove the Filipinos to shel
ter and the men were safely taken oft in
the launches.
The Bennington went from Manila to
Hongkong, where she was placed on the
drydock in June last. From Hongkong
she went to Shanghai, homeward bound,
and from Shanghai to Yokohama. She
remained in Japanese waters for a fort
night and on July 21 sailed for Honolulu.
From the latter port she came to San
Francisco.
The officers of the' Bennington are:
Commander E. K. Moore, Lieutenants R.
F. Lopez, N. A. McCully, S. E. Moses, G.
E. P. Stone. G. B. Rice and A. Crenshaw,
Ensigns W. H. Reynolds and W. A. As
serson. Surgeon R. M. Kennedy, Paymas
ter G. C. Shatter and Pay Clerk E. C.
Griswold. She carries 154 jackies and ma
rines whose term of enlistment has about
expired, while the officers' term of ser
vice in Asiatic waters is over.
Commander E. K. Wood was first here
in 1873 on the old sloop of war Portsmouth
and has been here on a number of occa
sions since. In 1892 he was here on the
Boston and was in Honolulu on that ves
sel during the troublous times of 1892-3.
The Bennington and Petrel probably will
not go to the navy yard until next week.
America during a Cape Horn gale and is
probably a total loss. A dispatch to the
Merchants' Exchange says she was driven
ashore and part of the crew was landed
at Puerto Gallego. The Fervaal sailed"
from Antwerp on June 29. She called at
Cherbourg, France, for-; orders and then
came on to the Pacific Coast. She made
good time, as the wreck must have oc
curred at least three weeks ago. Cap
tain Mabon probably saved his entire crew
and then made for the nearest port on
the main land in the ship's boats. The
Fervaal was to have loaded wheat at Port
land for Europe. She was one of the lat
est additions to the Frencn mercantile
marine and was on her maiden voyage.

A remarkable tree, dubbed the skunk
tree by those who have made its ac
quaintance, has been found in the grounds
of the Queens hospital here' in the Punch
bowl district. The tree gets its name
from the intensely disagreeable odor it
/gives forth. The first tree that was found
disturbed a number of residents of the
locality, who made complaints to the
Board of Health, with the result that
tnere was an inspection and improvement
of sewers in the locality. The nuisance
did not abate until the odor was traced
to the obnoxious tree, which was prompt
ly cut down and destroyed.
The tree is about the size of an ordinary
mango tree. Its objectionable odor comes
from the limbs and tender branches. No
one here has been able to Identify the
tree.

turned and accused him of stealing the
ring. He denied it and they searched him.
Walling threw a piece of paper on the
bed and the detectives found the two dia

ring, in the paper.
Detective Wren corroborated Mrs.
Dodge. In cross-examination he was ask
ed if the piece of .paper which contained
the rings was the same as that in Wal

NEW YORK, Aug. 16.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will eay: An Improvement alike in: tone
and in demand is noted in trade i circles * this
week," and fall trade ] may be said to have
opened actively. While the most optimistic
reports come from . the Northwest, Â¦ several
large markets in the corn belt; send more
cheerful reports, based partially upon a still
further improvement In crop conditions, but
likewise the result of the growth of a feel
ing that - while the yields of Â¦ most : crops will
be smaller than last year, : the prices , paid Â¦ for
the same will be higher . and' the ; purchasing
power of the agricultural community as a whole
will be little Impaired. Advances in wheat,
corn, oats and hog products support this view.
Good crops in the Pacific Northwest are also re
ported, and, the outlook for fall, trade In that
section Is a cheerful one, 1 the only flaw . at
present being the strike, confronting the ship
ping interests at San Francisco.

NEW YORK. Aug. 16.â The setback In prices
Â¦m-hich occurred' to-day while Influenced In a
measure by the less favorable aspect to the
btrike situation was primarily due to proat
tsklng Mle? on the week's rise. Improvements
iiave been made Jn pricee from day to day and
the resultant Â«=harp gains showed some strik
ing profits on the long account up to last night.
Bear filing had net been effective in check
ing the improvement and it required only tlie
announcement that th^ Joliet steel workers had
reconsidered their decision not to go out as
a pretext to sell the market. Naturally enough
the Western Ftocks which had made the larg
est gains r^cÂ»nt!y had to take the brunt cf the
tollintr But little rallying: power was dis
played by these stocks at any time during the
day. temporary gains being Immediately can
cried by renewed Fa ies for both accounts.
Their Iorws at the Inu point average a little
nr.ore than 1 per cent. St. Paul figuring for
the extreme decline of 1%. While the West
ern division was generally under pressure (here
Â»as heavy buying at times of the bituminous
and anthracite coal stocks, causing- an lm
rrovemer.t in Norfolk and Western of 1% and
V.'neHinr and Lake Erie issues of 2@3. South
western railroad stocks- were less prominent
than heretofore and the announcement of the
acquisition by the Wf.bash of the Omaha and
St. Louis Railroad failed to strengthen the
Vabash issues. There -was heavy purchases
of Amalgamated Copper late in the day and
the f tock rose 2V4 on reports that a combina
tion in which the company figured had secured
control of the copper production of the coun
try. Its top fisrure was not maintained, the
price running off a point near the close. Sugar
underwent many wMÂ» changes during the day
and after at one time celling a point above
}eEterday'6 close ended a point, lower. There
was no neiii to' account for the conspicuous
strength of People'6 Gas. which Improved 2H
ln fee* of the heaviness elsewhere. Reports
that the United States Steel Corporation had
tecured control of the Republic Iron and Steel
CctnrÂ«any caused active dealings in the lat
t*r e - crocks and they ended a point higher.
I^arge blocks of United States Steel stocks were
dealt :n at the open'.rg and It was at this
period that the low price of the day was made
f<T the common. One block of 6500 shares
oame out at 43%. but when It got down to
<3H. which Indicated a loss â¢ over night, the
Hock was supported and did net yield below

NEW. YORK. Aug. 16.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review will say to-morrow: While the
market Is inactive and transactions are 'main
ly of a professional character, there has been
during the past week a . decided change In
speculative sentiment. The fact that the steel
strike Is much less dangerous than was at
first anticipated and seems likely to collapse
altogether has had a. considerable : effect upon
the minds of the stock market operators and
has also encouraged renewed investment buy
ing of the United States Steel stocks. At the
same time the effects of the damage to the
corn crop have been minimized and the
"street" is less disposed- than 'it was a fort
night ago to accept the theory that corn in
the Western States is a -total loss, or ; that
railroad corporations serving the corn grow
ing sections of the countrv will show Â¦â¢ any
material decline in earnings ' during the en
suing twelve months. The money market also
continues . to be easy and there, Is no, scarcity,
of. funds for speculative uses, while a drop in
the exchange market brings forcibly, before the
eyes of the stock market public the fact that
the United' States is now enjoying a record
breaking export trade ln cereals: ' Railroad
earnings also continue to.be remarkably . good,
large Increases being shown ln most cases
over an extremely f avorable return of the cor
responding period a year ago.
Bradstreet's Financial Review.
There was a fair business on the morning
session of the Bond Exchange. Gas and Elec
tric opened higher at $40 50, but fell back - to
$39 75. Paauhau was firmer at $15. but Kllauea
was lower at *12@12 50 and Hutchlnson at
$13 50@14. The oil stocks were dull.
In the afternoon the light stocks were weak
at $37 50 for Pacific and $33 62%<Â§33 37% for Gas
and Electric. Hutchlnson Sugar was also easy
at *13 25S13 50.
The California Fruit Canners* Association has
declared a dividend of 60c per share, payable
on the 20th Inst. .
The capital of the California Cotton .Mills has
been increased from $800,000 to $1.2o0.000. The
new money will be used in enlarging the bust
ness.' -^ .%Â¦-:.>- Â¦<: . â

CHICAGO. Aug. 16.â September wheat opened
Me to %c higher at 71%@72%c under moderate
buying occasioned by the firmness of Liverpool
cables and the moderation of Argentine ship
ments. Scattered liquidation soon gave the
market, an easier tendency, which was helped
along by reports of favorable harvesting work
In the spring wheat country. The Price Cur
rent estimated a spring wheat crop of 300,000,
000 bushels of good quality. The ranks of the
Fellers swelled on this '. and Information of a
similar nature and September declined early
to 7OVÂ£c. Prices steadied here on bullish news
from France and buying for the French ac
count. September during the afternoon ran up
to 72c, and although there was profit taking at
the advance, the close was strong; %o over
yesterday, at 71%c. " ..^1
The corn market was active, although trade
was of a professional character. | The market
opened firm because of the stiffness of prices
at Liverpool. " After ,an early break of Uc
droueht news from Ohio. Indiana and Illinois
brought about a .rally. The close was at the
best price of the day at 59c, l%o over yes
terday. Â¦ â¢
Oats followed the* fortunes of corn. Septem
ber closed %@% c up at 36%c. .,-Â¦â¢
-Provisions advanced slightly for two reasons
âa demand for cash lard and meats and spec

with corn. The bulk of trade is now for de

DECIDUOUS FRUITS.
All^kinds of Melons are plentiful at about
previous prices. Grapes -keep steady under fair
arrivals. Citrus fruits remain as before.
There are too many ripe Bartlett Pears lying
around. The trouble with them Is that they
are wormy and undesirable for the retail trade.
Good green wrapped Pears for shipment would
sell quickly at $125 per, open box. but there
are very few coming ln. There are also more
bulk Plums offering, though there is no glut.
Nectarines are meeting with a better demand.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
Â¥?llf ha^ e been two arrivals of coal from
British Columbia. 6577 tons; two from Wash
ington. 5300 tons; one from Oregon, 400 tons;
one from Norfolk, \sl.. 1300 tons; total, 14,177
tons. The above list of arrivals will foot up
about equal to one-half of our actual consump
tion, under ordinary circumstances, which ot
course is now being materially reduced on ac
count of labor disturbances. There are now la
the harbor thirteen coal cargoes (seven steam
ers and six sailers): the aggregate of these will
foot up about 35,000 tons. The discharge of
these cargoes Is being delayed by the scarcity
of stevedores, now on a strike. The factories
using coal as a fuel are utilizing a very small
amount at present, for which an ample provis
ion has already been made. Steamers on the
Sound and In British Columbia are being with
held, some of them with full cargoes already on
board, awaiting the final settlement with the
labor leagues. The last reports from Austra
lia and Great Britain report coal freights un
changed, but fewer vessels being offered. Thla
naturally Intimates that bottom rates on coal
have been reached : ln fact, when coal freights
are quoted at about 10s 6d from Swansea,
Wales, and lls 6d from Australia. N. S. W
the nautral inference would be that bottom
rates had been reached, as a little less than
these figures would induce ships to come ln bal
last ln preference to accepting going rates." "

probably secure large lots. Woolen mills have

XEW YORK. Aug. 16. -The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The tone of the stock market was irood to
day. Americans began very cheerful, Erie,
Southern Pacific, . Union Pacific and Atchisons
being the favorites. There was a slight setback
here just before the New York opening, which
was attributed â¢ to the news that three more
lodges of the Amalgamated Association had
finally struck in accordance with the strike
orders. New York did little to help things
along, but London was inclined to buy on the
reaction and the close was strong.
The copper stocks were strong, on the fort
nightly statistics. Stocks have been reduced
c6o tons and supplies 1213 tons.

In textiles it Ms to be noted that the talk of
a strike, with the necessary curtailed produc
tion, has not strengthened print cloths, which
are 3-16c . lower on the week. -Woolen goods
appear to be better situated than those of cot
ton, and in raw products the- low and fine
grades of wool are firm, with some tending up
ward, while raw, cotton is without change. The
iron and : steel strike shows little change, but
an interesting fact is that despite . the low
ered' consumption Â¦â¢ growing out of the strike,
stocks of plgiron are smaller than they were
a month ago, on a comparatively trifling de
crease In production. Chicago 1 Iron . interests
are getting much business diverted from East
ern markets by the strike. Finished producli
affected; by the strike 'are very high, and tlft
position of canned goods ' manufacturers, de
mand from which is active, is rendered uncom
fortable by the scarcity of tin plates. Sheets
and bars are likewise firm. ,--Â¦".
Boot and shoe manufacturers have booked
good orders. Leather Is active and hides are
firm The strength of white pine, supported
as It has been by small stocks at leading mar
kets, is notable. Considerable advances have
been made at Eastern points to meet earlier
price advances at the West.

POSTUM CEEEAL.
BREAKFAST ON DRINK.
Coffee Makes Many Dyspeptics.
Â¦ *
"Coffee and I had quite a tussle. Two
years ago I was advised by the doctor to
quit the use of coffee, for I had a chronic
rase of dyspepsia and serious nervous
troubles, which did not yield to treat-
ment- I- was so addicted to coffee that
It seemed an impossibility to quit, but
v.hcn I was put on Postum Cereal Food
Offce there was no trouble in making
the change, and * to-day I am a well
woman.
"Or.e of the lady teachers In our public
schools was Eick and nervous. Frequently
the only thlngr she took for breakfast was
a cup of coffee; I urged her to try leaving
off the coffee and use Postum instead.
Went bo far as to send her a sample from '
ray box and give her directions. She now
uses nothing but Postum Food Coffee and
told me a short time, ago that Ehe was
perfectly welL "W
"It is easy to make good Postum. once
a person becomes accustomed to it. Put
four heaping teaspoons to the pint of
water and after it comes up to a boil, see
that from that time on it boils fifteen or
twenty minutes, then use good cream and
you have a drink that would be relished
by the queen. Be sure and put a piece of
nutter the size of a pea. in the pot to pre-
vent boiling over." Mr*. Llzze Whittaker.

a defensive battle all through.' He was
willing to mix with his sturdy opponent,
however, and nearly always - broke even
with him at infighting.

After a protest from John Redmond,
the Nationalist leader, against the Inade
quacy of the apology, the offenders were
recalled and asked If they were prepared
to withdraw their allegations. They did
so, in somewhat nervous tones.-. The
Speaker then' severely reprimanded the
two newspaper men, who were permitted
to depart, the members of the House jeer
ingly congratulating them on their escape
from Imprisonment In the. Tower.
After the Speaker, William Court Gully,
notified them of Â¦. the cause of the sum
mons, both Armstrong and Madge - ex
pressed regret at the appearance of the
article and apologized to the House. The
Speaker then ordered the delinquents to
Â¦withdraw while the House considered the
matter. Both the â editor and manager
backed out, bowing ' low at each step,
amid the derisive cheers of the Nation
alists.

The suit of W. S. Sntton against Joseph
Marsili to recover $150 was on - trial yes
terday before Justice of the Peace Dan

had painted a portrait of Marsili from a
photograph furnished by the latter' s wife.
Wfrer Button delivered the portrait Mrs.
Marsili found fault with the color of the
*yes and it was altered to suit her ideas.
Then one of her daughters objected to
a lump on her father's neck in the por
trait and Sutton removed the lump. Some
fifteen alterations were ordered by the
Marsili ladies, according to Sutton. who
testified that the picture was never re
jected until he asked, for his pay, and
then Mrs. Marsili claimed she had never
ordered the work to be done. Judge Dan
iels reserved his decision.
Seeks Pay for Painting Portrait.
The bosses are also boasting: that the
result of the primary election Is an in
dorsement of the present State adminis
tration. As the bosses are bent on mak
ing the gubernatorial fight of 1902 an Issue
in the municipal election this year, the
voters may govern themselves accord
ingly.
It is the boast of the push also that
County Clerk Deane is to be turned down
because the Chronicle supports the Re
publican Primary League.
It is the boast of the push that one nom
ination is already settled. Ex-Assembly
man Fisk, the Examiner's candidate . for
District Attorney, is said to be acceptable
to all the bosses.
Purpose of the League.
The Republican Primary League was es
tablished to promote rile cause of good lo
cal government in San Francisco. In this
work it rallied to its support eight thou
sand Republican voters. As it threatened
to extinguish bossism and political cor
ruption, the local and State bosses of
both parties, and all the tax looters and
place hunters, combined to defeat its tick
ets. The reverse at the polls last Tues
day has not changed the determination
of anti-boss Republicans to work stead
fastly In the cause of good government.
While Martin Kelly, Herrin. Crimmins.
Lynch and the resurrected Senatorial push
are bickering and dispatching agents from
one saloon to another in efforts to dis
pose of the convention's nominations, the
anti-boss Republicans are striving to en
list the zeal of the public in the cause of
honest municipal rule.
Word is passed around to the remnants
of the lamented Senatorial push of the
Sacramento campaign that Herrin Is to be
placed in the saddle again. The story goes
that H. E. Huntington is to be made
president of the Southern Pacific Com
panv and imrne<iiately on assuming power
he is to give Herrin authority to do poli
tics in the name of the corporation. The
rumor is noised around to induce dele
gates on the fence to see Herrin.
It mav be true that Huntington will
again go to the head of railroad affairs
and authorize the company to engage in
politics, but he cannot place Herrin at the
head of a. delegation -in the Republican
Municipal Convention. The distinction of
boss leadership in this field belongs to
Martin Kelly, who went before the people
and won out against the Primary League
and the Republican press. Kelly, expects
to make something out of his victory and
he has as much right to dispose of the
nominations to help himself as Herrin has
to <iistribute them for the benefit of the
railroad corporation and the Spring Val
lev Water Works.
The bosses in their disgraceful squabble
over the spoils seem to forget the fact
that fifty-two thousand registered voters
of Ban Francisco took no hand In the
primary election. The incident that the
Primary League cast 8000 votes and won
123 delegates is not considered by the
bosses. The Republican League's actual
membership of 4200 voters may be in
creased to 10,000 before the general elec
tion next November and perhaps again
doubled before the election for Governor
in 1902. .
Herrin May Be Rehabilitated.
Crlmmins from Kelly and assign the de
tached person to duty under Herrin has
not been carried out. The Indications are
that Herrin will be forced to accept the
conditions prescribed by Kelly. The boss
whose reputation has been appraised In
court as worth $1 holds a commission to
represent the Republicans in the conven
tion. He is in position to punish traitors
in the boss camp. He regards himself as
an orator as well as a boss. A sample or
his oratory was given last September to
an audience of San Francisco statesmen
at B'nai B'rith Hall, buto his few remarks
were too hot for the stenographers to
catch, hence no record of his fervent ora
tory exists. It is said that the big boss
intends to prepare himself for a grand
display of rhetoric in putting in nomina
tion the chairman of the convention. At
the September convention Kelly had too
many things to look after. His .secretary
was slow in seizing and calling the roll.
Guilfoyle hesitated about jumping on the
stage and bulldozing the chairman. Kelly
had to give his personal attention to these
little details of machine politics and at
the same time protect Samuels from Jack
McXamara. None of these tilings will
bother Boss Kelly at the next convention
of the Republican party in San Francisco.
Jack McNamara will not be there to
alarm the orator and deflect the oratory.
Phil Crimmins. in some obscure retreat
near the outside door, will look like "30
cents" compared with his Majesty Martin
Kelly at the head of the sullied statesmen
of the Twenty-eighth on the ground floor
of the convention: Expenses of the hall
could easily be defrayed by selling tickets
enabling people to hear the boss speak.
In order to preserve the eternal fitness
of things the price of a ticket might be
made Jl, to correspond with the judicial
appraisement of Kelly's reputation.

LIFE OF TORTURE
Samuel Levy, a Retired
Merchant, Victim , of
Suicide.
Strangles Himself to Decth
Because of Despondency
i \ Over. Sickness.
Samuel Levy, a retired merchant, 73
years of age, committed suicide at -his
residence, 1003 Sutter street, last evening
by strangulation. Some months ago the
unfortunate man attempted to kill " him
self by cutting his threat in Jefferson
Square. ; He suffered from asthma and
life had become a burden to him. He im
agined himself a source of annoyance to
his friends and relatives and sought to rid
them of his care by death.
Mr. Levy was engaged in the furniture
business In Cincinnati' for a number of
years and flve years ago came to the Pa
clflc Coast, hoping that the change of cli
mate would benefit his health. Instead of
becoming better he gradually grew worse
and suffered. much from the wasting dis
ease. About three months ago he was
picked up in Jefferson Square, where he
had cut an ugly gash in his threat. He
was sent to the Receiving- Hospital and
begged the surgeons, when he recovered
consciousness, to take the stitches out of
the wound and let him bleed to death.
Upon his recovery he was cared for by
his son, but the incurable malady contin
ued Its torture, and he was carefully
watched to prevent a second attempt upon
his 'life. / . , Â¦ â¢
A few days ago it was arranged that
ho should go to Colorado and railroad
tickets had already been procured for
himself and his aged wife. Last night
when a servant knocked at the door of
his room to bring him his supper he found
his entrance barred. When the door was
forced Mr. Levy was found seated In a
chair with a rope, each end of which was
attached to a bedpost, wrapped around his
neck. He had- slowly strangled himself
to death.
The body was taken to the Morgue by
Deputies Brown and Meehan and an In
quest will be held. Levy leaves a wife
and son, the latter the proprietor' of the
Sutter-street Hotel.

Rev. W. W. Case ; delivered an interest
ing lecture last- night at the Simpson Me
morial Church to a large and appreciative
audience. , The material" for the lecture
was gathered by the reverend ' speaker
during- his recent visit to Europe. He
took his auditors through the capitals of
the Old World and gave them some inter
esting glimpses of the Holy Land as it. is
to-day. There was a' short musical â¢ pro
gramme before the lecture, to which Miss
Mabel Perkins, Miss Mabel Jones and
Charles Â¦ Taylor contributed selections.. â¢ *

Stone gave his age as 21, but he looks
four or five years older. He . is broad
shouldered, â¢: and his ; hands show signs of
hard work. He is a fluent talker and ap
parently has received a good education.
He denies that Stone Is his true name. He
is a â¢ native of New i York and says he
was graduated from the high schol there.
He. left. New York in 1898 and went to
Norfolk. .Va..: . .. .'
"The New York World had two war
correspondents there," he said, "and they
chartered a Norwegian vessel to follow
the flying 'squadron. They engaged me as
stenographer and . typewriter and we fol.
lowed the squadron to Key West,- working
between, the Florida and Cuban coasts for
four months. After that we went to Ha
vana, and on our return to Tampa I was
discharged. "I went. to New Orleans, and
after remaining there; for a few days I
shipped. as quartermaster on a liner for
New York. , I went to a business college
and a few months, later shipped on the
pilot schooner Negus. I sailed around the
Horn, "landing in Seattle In June of last
year. I went to Nome, but not meeting
with much â¢ luck, returned." .Stone was
careful not'Â«to say anything .'. about his
residence here and defied the detectives
to locate his room, but they expect to dis

asked to visit- the prison to see if she
can identify him.
â¢Stone appeared in Judge Conlan's court
yesterday morning on the- charge of bur
glary for breaking into the Spruance resi
dence and on a charge of having-burg
lars'-tools in his possession. After. being
instructed as to his rights he offered to
plead, guilty to the burglary charge. The
Judge told him that he could- not accept
his plea of guilty on the felony charge and
continued, both -cases â¢ till August 21.
Stone's object -in pleading guilty was evi
dently for the purpose of having the
burglary case disposed of -before the de
tectives could secure ' evidence against
him on other charges. ' . . . " .. . . \
Conger arrived here six weeks ago from
Honolulu, and was regarded as a "high
roller" at the Palace Hotel, where he re
sided. When the publishing company
heard that he was about to leave the city
the order of arrest followed and a com-*
promise was effected by Conger paying
$283 in cash to the company and giving a
note for the balance.
The thought of leaving hte fiancee was
too much for the impatient* swain, how
ever, and the trip was abandoned for an
earlier wedding. Mr.- and Mrs. Conger
will remain in the city for about ten days,
when they will leave for New York, and
thence to Europe, where the balance of
the honeymoon will be spent.
Conger first met his wife about a year
ago while here on a visit. They were not
formally engaged at that time, but it was
understood that they were very fond of
each other and probably would be in the
near future. The present visit served to
bring matters to a climax and It was ar
ranged that the marriage should take
place in the fall, when Conger had re
turned from a trip to China. j
The ceremony was performed later in the
evening by Rev. Dr. Leavitt of the First
Unitarian, Church at the residence of the
bride's parents. None but the immediate
members of the bride's family were pres
ent, as young Conger desired as little dis
play as possible on account of his recent
arrest. After the wedding Mr. and Mrs.
Conger drove to the Palace, where they
secured apartments and then, taking a
hack, started out to enjoy a little supper
together.
After Conger procured his license he
left the County Clerk's office with his
fiancee and a lady and gentleman who
accompanied them.
Conger gave his residence as New York
City and his age as 31. His bride con
fessed to 18 summers and is the daughter
of Henry S. Fitch, bookkeeper for the
Crown -Point Mining Company, residing
at 990 Pine street. The young man bitter
ly railed to "Cupid" Danforth at the
newspapers for. publishing the account of
his arrest at tho instance of the Gilbert
Publishing Company for collecting $523
without authority.
Roy U. Conger, nephew of United States
Minister Conger, who has been having
trouble with his creditors, took out a
marriage license yesterday to wed Miss
Grace M. . Fitch. Young Conger appeared
bef orÂ© "Cupid" Danforth ; with his bride
to-be in a rather jubilant fashion and
answered all the questions generally put
to prospective husbands and wives.
Trouble Over Street-Sweeping.
The Supervisors' Street . Committee met
yesterday to consider the bills submitted
by Gray Brothers for i sweeping the
streets during July. The Board of Super
visors had reduced the bills by $155 be
cause of inferior work. Testimony was
taken with a view to making a further
reduction. Inspector of. Sweepings Dutton
explained how the contractors had omit
ted in their bills a number of other blocks
which he had- rejected. The committee
directed Dutton to present an itemized
statement of the blocks rejected because
they had been improperly swept. The in
vestigation Â¦ will be resumed this after
noon. Â¦:
Detectives Dinan and Wren discovered
yesterday morning that the suit of clothes
Stone wore when caught bore the addr.ess
of Arthur Callaghan; 2613 Pacific avenue.
Callaghan's house was entered on" the
night of July : i and the suit stolen. Stone
was compelled to doff the suit and was
furnished with some old clothes belonging
to one of the "trusties." He will also.be
charged with the Callaghan burglary. .;
The detectives are satisfied that Stone
is the burglar who entered. the. residence
of Dr. M. F. Bows, 2629 Pacific avenue," ori
the night. of April 21. Â« The only. person in
the house at the time was the servant
girl, and the Burglar with a revolver in his
hand compelled her to take him to the
rooms where jewelry could be found. 'He
carried away with him a watch and a
gold stick pin. set t with emeralds and dia
monds.' He .was very polite â¢ and assured
the girl that he would, not harm her. She
gave an accurate description of â¢ him at
the time and Stone fits it.;: She will be
Was Wearing Stolen Clothing.
Francis Erbln, the: butler at the Ham
mond residence, who also came under the
observation of the burglar, was taken to
the City Prison yesterday afternoon by
Detectives Dinan ana Wren. Stone was
placed alongside of five other .prisoners
and Erbin failed to identify him. He
seemed too scared to take a good look at
the men. About an hour later Mrs.
Hammond was taken to the" prison" and
she at once picked out Stone. A lady who
accompanied her was bo affected by i the
scene that she burst into tears. Marie
Dake, the maid, also positively identified
Stone later. His identification was made
easy by his right eye, which seems, to
have a film over it. . When Mrs. Hammond
was looking at him his knees ..shook and a
ghastly smile overspread his ' face." Stone
will be charged with that; burglary. ... ;
young man captured after an
I exciting chase Thursday^night'by
I Special Officer Helbush, who dls
il covered him breaking Into the resi
dence of John Spruance at 2504
Jackson street. Is not the notorious Â¦"Bill
the borer," but the gentlemanly burglar,
or porch-climber, whose Chesterfleldlan
demeanor at the residence of Mrs. A. B.
Hammond, at 2610 Jackson street, on the
night of July 5 made him famous. > He
was courtesy Itself to Mrs. Hammond and
her daughter, Florence, when detected in
a bedroom, and excited their pity'by tear
fully telling them that he would not- harm
them, as he had a young sister himself.
He got $20 from Mrs. Hammond and was
shown to the door by her maid, Marie
Dake, who. got. a good look at his face
as he removed the handkerchief that he
had used as a mask while speaking to the
ladies. ' â¢ . .
