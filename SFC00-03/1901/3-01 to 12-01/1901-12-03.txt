OPENING SCENES IN THE HOUSE
FURNISH A GREAT SPECTACLE
Amid Beautiful Floral Tribu : tes^,the_|{epresentativeis.
Organize by the Election of Of f iceirs.
WASHINGTON. -Dec 2.â
The opening day. of tha
first session of the Fifty
seventh Congress in the
House of Representatives
furnished a spectacle that
delighted the crowded galleries. The ma
chinery of the House is cumberous and
is set in motion by a laborious process,
but the spectators to-day evidently did
not consider it tedious, as they clung to
their places through the entire proceed
ings, which lasted four â  - and one-half
hours, probably half the time being con
sumed in the monotonous calling of the
rolL The organization of the House was
accomplished according to time-honored
precedents. Speaker Henderson was
Eworn in by General Blngham, and after
delivering a very graceful speech In rec
ognition of the honor bestowed upon
him he in turn administered the oatu to
the meinbers-elect. The usual commit
tees were appointed to inform the Presi
dent and the Senate that the House was
organized and ready to do business; a
committee of three, consisting of Payne,
Hingrham and Richardson, was appointed
lo join a similar committee of the Sen
ate and wait upon the President and
inform him that Congress was ready to'
receive any communication he might
have to make; the rules cf the last House
were adopted after a slight jar, and then
the biennial seat-drawing occurred. This
latter ceremony was robbed of much of
its Interest to-day by the fact that under
the new arrangement oi seats there are
more than enough to go round and those
whese names are drawn last do not suffer
8.s they did on former occasions.
Beautiful Floral Display.
The flower Ehow, which Is the great
feature of the opening day, was not as
imposing as usual. More flowers -than
ever before were sent to members, but
after the Beat-drawing the House ad
journed before a third of them were
brought Into the hall.
On the floor members were arriving
every minute. The lobby in the rear of
the hall was filled with floral emblems
t tent to popular members, by admiring
' constituents. There were tons of flowers
end a glance through the lobby was like
a vista through a veritable flower garden.
>.s< a rule, the leaders on both sides,
like the principal actors in a drama, were
fclow in making their appearance, but as
-wÂ«y arrived the celebrities were eagerly
'â¢pointed out to the spectators in the gal
leries. Richardson of Tennessee took his
old place about the center of the minor
ity side shortly after 11 o'clock. He was
immediately surrounded by his Demo
cratic colleagues. General Grpsvenor of
Ohio was recognized instantly when he
appeared with the never-failing carnation
In his buttonhole. Dalzell of Pennsylva
nia. Littlefield. the hard-hitter from
Maine, who leaped into prominence in the
last Congress: Hepburn of Iowa, another
wielder of the sledge hammer, and other
prominent members began arriving soon
after. A number of Senators, including
Senator Bpooner *of Wisconsin, drifted
in from the Senate side to confer with
their colleagues of the House. "Deacon"

floor as usual, renewing old acquaint
ances. The 'unwonted spectacle of a
member of the Supreme -Court in the ball
was also witnessedâ Justice McKenna,
himself an old member of the House.
House Called to Order.
At 11:30 o'clock one of the assistant
doorkeepers, standing at the clerk's desk,
warned those on the floor that those not
entitled to be there must retire. Wilcox,
the swarthy Delegate from Hawaii, and
Degetau, the Delegate from Porto Rico,
attracted attention as they moved]through
the throng on the floor. Every chair ex
cept those in the diplomatic and execu
tive galleries was occupied when, at 12
o'clock, McDowell, clerk of the House,
brought his gavel down. The b^zz of con
versation ceased and the clerk announced
that prayer would be offered. The mem
bers and many of â  the spectators arose
and stood with bowed heads as the Rev.
Couden, the blind chaplain, invoked ' the
divine blessing. He referred feelingly to
the death cf President McKinley.' '
The roll of members-elect was then
called by States, amid an, ever-Increasing
uproar of voices as conversation became
general throughout the hall. When the
clerk announced that 318 membersâ a quo
rum â had answered to their names. Lacy
of Iowa, moved . that -the House proceed by
viva voce vote to the election of a Speak
er. The motion being carried, Cannon of
Illinois,. chairman of the Republican cau
cus, placed in nomination General Hen
derson of Iowa, amid a salvo of applause
frcm the entire Republican membership.
Henderson Chosen Speaker.
Hay of Virginia, chairman of the Demo
cratic caucus, amid loud Democratic ap
plause, . presented the name* of Richard
son of Tennessee. A general laugh fol
lowed as Neville of Nebraska placed In
nomination Stark of his own State, who
is now the only, other Populist acting in
dependently. Rumple (R.) of Iowa, Me-
Clellan CD.) of New York, Bates (R.) of
Pennsylvania and Maddox (D.) of, Geor
gia were appointed tellers. The /result
was: Henderson, 190; Richardson,' .149;
Stark. 1; Cummins of New York.l. -
Richardson, Stark and Cummins ' were
appointed a committee to escort the
Speaker to the chair. As General Hen
derson appeared two minutes later on the
arm of Richardson, the- Speaker, was
greeted with a great outburst of applause
from both sides of the House. Richard
son introduced him in half a dozen words.
The Speaker spoke briefly:
"Gentlemen of. the House of Represen
tatives: This high honor that you have
conferred^ upon me I profoundly appreci
ate. All. the more do I appreciate it, com
ing as It does with this generous expres
sion from both sides of the chamber.
There is left another method for a pre
siding officer to express his appreciation
of such an honorâ that Is by a kindly;
firm and faithful administration of the
law and the rules that govern this body.
It will be my aim to discharge impar
tially the duties of this office. Aa I said
at the opening of the last Congress, no
presiding officer can successfully admin
ister the duties of his office unless he has
the support of the body over which * he
presides. I asked . f or â¢ it then ; â¢ you < gave
it to me throughout the entire Congress.
Permit me once more, .to . invoke, that *pa-

tlence, kind and splendid support which
was accorded to me In the last Congress."
"The maker of laws should not be a
breaker of laws. We proceed under law
and rules, and the duties devolving upon
each and all of the membership of this
House will be far better conserved If this
principle is keptin mind and acted upon..
"Again sincerely thanking you each and
all, I am ready to take the prescribed
oath of oflice." (Applause.)
Bing-ham Administers Oath. . . Â» '
The duty of .administering the oath of
office to the Speaker fell to Bingham of
Pennsylvania, the oldest member of the
House in point of continuous service.
The Speaker then in turn administered
the- oath to the members-elect. They
came forward in State delegations as
their names were called. At the conclu
sion of the ceremony the Speaker laid
before the House the resignation of Nich
olas Muller as a Representative from the'
Seventh Congressional District of New
York, to. take effect December 1.
Cannon of Illinois then presented the
following resolution for the election of
officers of the House:
"Resolved, That Alexander ' McDowell
of Pennsylvania be and' Is hereby chosen
Clerk of the House of Representatives;
that Henry Casson of Wisconsin be and
Is hereby, chosen sergeant-at-arms; that
William Glennan of New York be and is
hereby chosen doorkeeper; that Joseph
C. McElroy of Ohio be and Is hereby
chosen postmaster; and that H. N. Cou
gen of Michigan be and is hereby chosen
chaplain. 1 '
Hay of Virginia, on behalf of the mi
nority, presented a substitute resolution
containing the names of the candidates
selected by the Democratic caucus, last
Saturday. The minority resolution- was
voted down and Cannon's resolution was
adopted without division. . - ..
To Notify, the President.
The usual formal resolutions to notify
the President and Senate. that the House
had selected Henderson as Speaker and
McDowell as Clerk were adopted. â .'.-â 
. Bingham of Pennsylvania then offered
a resolution for appointment by- the
Speaker of a committee of three, to Join
a similar committee of the Senate to i'wait
upon the President and notify him that a
quorum of the two houses had assembled
and that Congress was ready to receive
any communication he might have .to
make. The resolution was adopted and
the Speaker appointed Payne of New
York, Bingham of Pennsylvania and
Richardson of Tennessee.
Dalzell then offered the resolution
adopted by the Republican caucus on Sat
urday for the adoption of . the rules of
the House, with certain specified amend
ments, as the rules of the present House.
This drew the first fire from "the other
aide. Richardson inquired whether op
portunity, was to be given to offer
amendments, and on receiving a negative
reply he protested against such Â» action.
He said he desired to offer some. amend
ments which he thought would prevail if
the gentleman â  from Iowa (Hepburn)
could deliver? the forty votes which the
newspapers had said he had in the Re
publican caucus last Saturday.

WASHINGTON. Dec 2.â
The opening of tha flrst
session of the Fifty
seventh Congress this
morning drew to the
Capitol a great throng
of spectators eager to witness the- scenes

assembling of the national lawmakers.
Although the actual work of the two
houses was hot to begin until 12 o'clock
the .historic old structure, now refur
nished from end to end until it shone with
marble, gilt and rich decorations, waa
astir long before that hour. It was an
ideal day. to bring out the public, sunny
and warm, with just enough breeze from
the south to lazily stir the flags over the
Capitol, some of which were raised for
the first time since the adjournment of
Congress nine months ago.
No Restriction to Crowds.
There were no entrance restrictions and
the crowd flowed uninterruptedly into tha
building. Many ladles were In the throng.
Including the wives asd families of Sen

the usual handshaking among old friends
and informal talk of the work ahead.
The veteran Senator from Iowa, Allison,
was one of the first to reach the Sonata

FIGHT FOR EXCLUSION OF THE CHINESE

CALL BUREAU, 1406- G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON. Dec. 2.-
When Congress convened, at noon
to-day both California Sena-
tors were in .their seats, ah<i
all of the California members answered
to the House roll call. This, the Fifty
seventh Congress, enters' upon an era of
action which promises to be of great im
portance to the Pacific Coast. Besides the
exclusion of Chinese, which is of para
mount interest, there are the Nicaragua
canal construction bill, Philippine govern
ment bill, the question of irrigation, etc.
Other Congresses of recent years have
passed upon questions of war and strife,
but this Congress will deal with issues no
less important and involving the every-day
material interests of the citizens of the
United States and the welfare of other
peoples whose destinies war has placed in
their hands.
It is in part a new Congress. A goodly
proportion of fresh blood was infused in
the recent elections. Representatives
coming direct from the people will be
present to voice the wishes of their con
stituents. At the same time, there re
main in both Senate and House practic
ally the same number of old leaders, men
of wide experience In legislating, of
thorough familiarity with the needs of
the country, the policies of the dominant
party and parliamentary practice. It
would seem to be a commingling of con
eervatism and enterprise.
Clear Majority in House.
The House has a membership of 357 of
which 197 are Republicans and 151 are
Democrats and 9 are Fusionlsts, Silver
ltes and Populists. With this division the
Republicans would have a clear majority
over all of thirty-seven in case the Popu
lists voted with the Democrats on party
questions.
â¢ The Senate has eighty-seven members,
there being at present three vacancies
The Republicans will have a majority in
the Senate varying from twenty to
twenty-four, according to the way certain
â former Populists and Fusionlsis vote, and
.taking into consideration the proba
bility of at least one Democrat voting
with the administration on national poll
:cies.
" The new members of the House number
.ninety-two, of whom fifty are Republi
cans, thirty-eight are Democrats and four
are Fusionista, but who will probably voto
with the Democrats.
Thus not only is there a preponderance
in numbers of old members of the House
in the present body, but it happens that
most of the individual and experienced
â¢men in both parties were re-elected. The
Questions of national, Internal and foreign
policy' which' are^to be treated and.solved,
cr-rpartly" settled ' by this" Congress' have
been discussed-, for- \yeteks '-past in inter
views with incoming legislators and are
well-defined" and, â¢familiar: -Internal taxa
tion and internal improvements in trade
relations twlth foreign-nations and the de
pendencies; Nicaraguan canal arid the up
buil-iing of thei. American merchant .'ma
rine; increased -naval strength and: coast
defense; submarine telegraphic communi
cations with the Pacific possessions, will
be some of the principal subjects of Con
gressional .consideration.
Clearly Denned Issues.
The new Congress began its work with
a new President -in the White House â not
a new administration, however. In the
fullest sense of the word, for the pledge
the present executive made by the bier
of his predecessor to follow in his foot
steps is still fresh in the memory of the
nation. Aside from the economic phase of
the prospective legislation of this Con
gress its work will be watched. with in
terest from a political .view. point. Cam
paign material for the impending Con
gressional election Is to be made. The
two old parties, having shaken off popu
lism, will face each other on clearly de
fined issues.
The first session promises to be a long
one, probably running -far 'into the sum
mer. Every Senator and Representative
expects it to be an interesting and mo
mentous one. There are not likely to be
many changes made in the committee po
sitions of California Senators and mem
bers, and this is fortunate as they all have
first-class committee places with the ex
ception of Congressman Woods. He suc
ceeded Congressman De Vries when the
latter resigned, but did not fall' heir to
De Vries' important committee assign
ments; in fact, his sole committee position
,ls on '"ventilation and acoustics." This
body Is supposed to regulate and purify
the atmosphere of the House wing of the
Capitol, but unfortunately It never meets
to do business. <â¢â =â â

"A great many Congressmen who were

BY C. C. CARLTON.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, D. C.
Dec. 2.â There appears to be, no
doubt whatever in the minds of
California's Senators and Repre
sentatives in Congress that the Geary
Chinese exclusion act will be continued
in force and strengthened. No sooner
had Congress assembled than the Cali
fornia and the entire Pacific Coast dele
gations set diligently to work in advoca
cy of more rigid exclusion. It Is, of
course, the subject of legislation of par
amount interest to the Pacific Coast re
gion. But they were surprised to find
such lively interest exhibited by Senators,
and members from all sections of the
country. The Boxer uprising and atroci
ties committed during the siege of Pe
king have greatly intensified the feeling
against the Celestials, and the sentiment
against undesirable immigrants of all
classes, especially the anarchists, fanned
Into a flame by the assassination of Pres
ident. McKlnley, has not been allowed to
die cut. Every other member ha3 "a
bill" to put Into the legislative hopper
calculated to protect America from this
dangerous element.
Nor is the Boxer uprising forgotten
The anarchists and Chinese are included
in one sweeping anathema, "They must
go." The laoor organizations throughout
the country are up in arms, too. and
should there be any sentimentalist In this
Congress who religiously protest against
what they are pleased to call "race pre
judice and persecution of the poor heath
en," that sentiment will be quickly dis
pelled when they are brought face to face
with the thousands of petitions and me
morials that are now pouring in from
labor organizations all over . the country.
The petitions are being piled up in the
Capitol like cord wood. The labor organ
izations and the votes of individual work
ingmen are greatly feared by the average
member of Congress.
Combating Chinese Contributions.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation -of Labor, proposes
to solicit dollar subscriptions from mem
bers of the organization with which to
combat the fund to be raised by the Chi
nese Six Companies, who have assessed
each Chinaman In this country $1. Gom
pers has powerful allies in the heads of
other labor associations. Eugene V.
Debs of Indiana introduced a resolution
in the Central Labor Union which de
clares that capitalists would "use the
poorest paid toilers of the earth to Cheap
en production and force workingmen to
the degradation of being leveled to the
plane of these Imported Chinese. Con
gressmen and all thinking men should
use their influence to cause the re-enact
ment of the Chinese exclusion laws."
Congressman Holliday of Debs" district
says:
"I believe that the law excluding Cht
nese should be re-enacted. The country's
prosperity depends largely on the abKlty
of the worklngman to obtain good wage*.
To permit an alien people who are willing
to work for starvation wages to come into
this country and compete with our own
laborers would lower the general average
of wages and diminish by-so much the
ability of the American laborer to sup
port his family and educate his children "
John T. Morgan of Portland, Ore., who
came East to attend the convention of
the American Federation of Labor will
speak at a mass-meeting In Philadelphia
Saturday night and will then come to
Washington. Morgan and other delegates
from the West will deliver addresses
urging exclusion. The Central Labor
Union adopted resolutions calling upon
Congressmen to exert every effort in the
extension of the Chinese exclusion law.
In Favor of Exclusion.
The effect of labor union petitions upon
Congressmen is shown by a straw vote
of the Pennsylvania delegation taken on
a train between PhiladeltThta and Wash
ington by The Call correspondent yester
day. Of, twenty-five Congressmen inter
viewed nineteen expressed â¢ themseivc3 in
favor of rigid exclusion and six wai'ted
"time to think." Quay was silent as
usual.
Representative Mondell of "Wyoming is
one of the most energetic Western mem
bers in behalf of exclusion. He has al
ready introduced a bill on the lines of the
Geary act. " Wi " 4C
"The people of my State and those of
the , whole Pacific Coast are very much
in earnest on this question," said Mon
deU to-day. "And they will be content
with nothing less stringent than the
P e W a Â»K < if Sh o al^l Ve Â». es ? eclal attention
to the subject, and if the law now in ex
istence or some other equally prohibitive
is not adopted it will not be my fault. I
am personally very much interested, be
eause I feel that If by Â«ny B Hp Congress
should adjourn without taking adequate
action it would be a national calamity.
There is no doubt that thousands and
perhaps hundreds of tnousands of Mon
golians are now waiting: to emigrate Here
in expectation that the Geary law or some
similar bill will not be enacted. For- w.y;
part I can see no argument that will ex
cuse a Congressman voting against ex
clusion." â¢â  â¢ . â  â 
Representative Lacey of Iowa said:
"Chinese exclusion â was one of the ' suu
jects which I made much or in my speech
in the last campaign in my State. The
labor organizations of Iowa were agitat
ing the question even then, and I thought
that they should be given an answer. I
told them I was for Chinese excluslo-i.
with an exception. The exception consti
tuted the fifty Chinamen who were on
board the American warships when Ad
miral Dewey licked the Spaniards at Ma
nila. These men should be admitted to
the United States, but no others. The in
terests of the laboring people of the coun
try demand that the bars be kept up, and
I think there is no doubt that Congress
will heed this demand."
Representative Frank Newlandg of Ne
vada is another ally of the Calif ornlan3,
and is doing effective missionary work.
President on the Kight Side.
President Roosevelt will, In his message
to Congress to-morrow, take a deter
mined stand In favor of continuing Chi
nese exclusion, and may. It is understood,
suggest some strong amendments.
Congressman Hitt. chairman of the For
eign Affairs Committee of the House,
is also favorable to a continuance of the
Geary act, and, as he is one of the ablest
talkers on the floor of the House, and
one of the most influential, he will prove
a powerful ally of the Pacific Coast Con
gressmen.
In the Senate, although matters will
be favorable, there are some old-school
Senators like Hoar, for instance, who
may protest against the "unchristlan
like" treatment of the "poor heathen,"*
just as they have often for purely sen
timental reasons lifted their eloquent
voices for "Lo, the poor Indian."
The chairmanship of the Foreign Re
lations Committee will also be a factor
in determining the bill's fate in the Sen
ate. If Frye were to be chosen to suc
ceed Senator Cushman K. Davis of Min
nesota, deceased, he might make trou
ble, for, as is well known, Frye has long
been a warm friend and persistent cham
pion of the Pacific railroads. He was
Huntlngton's best friend in the en
tire Congress, Just as Morgan of
Alabama, also a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, was his worst en
emy. Frye has never been an earnest
advocate of the Nicaragua canal, but
Morgan" has been its champion always.
Lodge a Friend of Coast.
Should Senator Lodge be made chair
man, the Pacific Coast will have a good
friend at the head of that committee.
Lodge is an intimate friend of President
Roosevelt. He will be the President's
mouthpiece In the Senate and will strive
to make the administration's policies ef
fective in that body. The chances are.
however, that Cullom of Illinois will
head the Foreign Relations Committee.
Hla attitude concerning exclusion is in
some doubt, though Californians say he
will not ignore the expressions of the
Chicago labor unions:
In conciusicn there appears to b*Â» no
doubt whatever In the minds of Califor
nia's Senators and Representatives that
Chinese exclusion will be continued.
Their only hope is to get in some strong
amendments to make it more effective,
and seek some means to prevent Chinese
entry into this country via Mexico.
While declaring their entire faith in
the passage of an exclusion act at this
session of Congress, each and every one
<-t them when seen to-nJght by The Call
representative said that the Pacific Coast
people should not relax their vigilance or
their energy merely because the prospects
Â»cem bright, for there are powerful in
i terests at work In favor of the Chinese.
and chief among them is the gigantic
combination of Pacific railroads, with
Morgan, Hill and Harriman at their head.

CONGRESS HAS POWER
TO IMPOSE DUTY ON
PORTO RICAN EXPORTS
United States Supreme Court Sustains the
Constitutionality of the Law In
volved in Dooley Case.
WASHINGTON, Dec 2.-The
United States Supreme Court
to-day decided the second of
the Dooley cases. Involving
the constitutionality of the
law of April 12, providing for the collec
â¢ tion of duty on articles shipped from the
Â» United States into Porto Rico. The de
cision was rendered by Justice Brown.
The Government is sustained In the sec
ond Dooley case. The Chief Justice and
Justices Harlan, Brewer and Peckham
united in a dissenting opinion. They hold
that the duty imposed was export in
character and the fact that it was levied
lor the benefit of Porto Rico did not
change Its character.
The Dooley case grows out of the im
position of tariff duties on goods shipped
from New York to Porto Rico May 1,
jyOO, to October 23 of the same year under
the act of April 12, 1900, providing reve
nues and a civil government for Porto
Kico, the sum involved being 51433. This
money was collected at Porto Rico on
goods shipped to that port by Dooley,
Smith & Co. to their agent In San Juan.
The collections were imposed under that
eection of law in question which provides
that " all merchandise coming into Porto
Rico from the Uunted States shall
be entered at the ceveral ports of entry
on payment of the 15 per cent duties
which are required to be levied, collected
Â«.nd paid on like articles of merchandise
imported from foreign countries into the
United States under the Dingley tariff
law."
The contention on the part of Dooley' t>
counsel vÂ»*as that Congress had not
power under the constitution to impose
taxes or duties such as were levied under
ihe act of April 12 on articles taken into
I J orto Rican ports from other ports of
The United States, Porto Rico being an
f integral portion of the nation.
Porto Rico Not Foreign Territory.
Justice Brown held that as Porto Rico
is not foreign territory the goods shipped
to Porto Rico are not exports, but
whether exports or imports, the wide
range of Congress In the matter of* tax
ation was sufficient for a contingency of
this character. At best, he said, the duty
was a temporary expedient, and as it was
explicitly provided in . the Foraker act
that the Porto Rican Legislature could
change the character of the enactment
it was held that the Foraker act was
merely legislation in the interest of Por
to Rico. The Foraker act was sustained
on the grounds laid down in the Downs
case, another of the insular cases decided
at the last term. The decision of the
lower court was affirmed. Justice Brown
fxplicltly ea'd that the opinion was not
to be construed as a justification of ex
port duties.
Justice Brown said that the duties levied
were attacked on the ground that they
violated the clause of the constitution de
elarir.g- that "no tax or duty shall be laid
on articles exported from any State."
The court, he said. In the case of Wood
ruff vs. Parham, had held that the word
"import" in connection with the provis
ions cf the constitution, "that no State
shall levy any imposts or duties on im
ports or exports." "applied only to articles
Imported from foreign countries into the
United States. In that case Justice Miller,
â who delivered the opinion of the court,
gaid:
It Is not too much to say so far as research
has extended neither the words "export" nor
"import" nor "imposts" are to be found in the
<-;.- ut^ion of this subject as they have come
down to us from that time In reference to anv
other than foreign commerce -without some
special form of words to show that foreign
commerce is not meant. Whether we look,
then, to the terms of the clause of the con
stitution in question, or its relations to other
parts of that instrument, or to the history of
Its formation and adoption, or to the com
ments of the eminent men who took part in
those transactions, we are forced to The con
clusion tiiat no intention existed to prohibit
by this clause.
This definition of the word "imposts"
had afterward been approved in the case
of Brown vs. Houston. Proceeding, Jus
tice Brown said that if then. Porto Rico
he no longer a foreign country under the
Ding-ley act. as was held by a majority of
the court In De Lima vs. Bidwell, it Is
impossible to say that goods carried from
New Ycrk to Porto Rico can be con-
Fid^red as "exported" from New York
v.-ithin the meaning of that clause of the
constitution. If they are neither exports
nor imports they are still liable to be
taxed by Congress under the ample and
comprehensive authority conferred by the
constitution, "to lay and collect taxes,
duties, imposts and excises."
Findings of Justice Brown.
The question whether a duty laid by
Congress upon goods arriving at Porto
Kico from New York is a duty Vpon an
export from New York or upon an import
to Porto RSco. he said, was not free from
doubt, the manner in which and the
place at which the tax Is levied being of
minor consequence. Justice Brown con
tinuing said:
Oce thin*, however. Is entirely clear. The
tax !mr>oi-ed is on goods imported to Porto
Kico r.ince it was enacted by the Collector of
the Port of San Juan after the arrival of the
roods within the limits of that port. From
this moment the duties became payable as
cpon imported merciiandise. Xow, while an
Import into one port almost necessarily in
volves a prior export from another, still, in
determining the character of the tax Imposed,
it 'Â£ important to consider whether the duty
be laid for the purpose of adding to the reve
nues r,f the country from which the export
takes nlace or for the benefit of the territory
Into which they are imported. By the third
section of the Foraker act imposing: duties
upon merchandise coming into Porto Rico from
the United States It is declared that "when

ON PENNSYLVANIA MINE
Supreme Court Decides Adversely to
the Boston and Montana Mining
Company.
HELENA, Mont., Dec. 2.â The Supreme
Court to-day handed down an Important
decision in the litigation between the Bos
ton and Montana Mining Company and
the Montana Ore Purchasing Company.
Eoroe time ago Judge Clancy of Butte de
nied a motion of the Boston and Mon
tana Company for an injunction to re
strain the Montana Ore Purchasing
Company from working the Pennsylvania
mine pending a decision on the ownership
of the mine by the Supreme Court. The
Boston and Montana appealed from
Judge Clancy to the Supreme Court and
the latter to-day affirmed the lower
court. There is now a provisional injunc
tion in force, under the terms of which
the Montana Ore Purchasing Company is
operating the Pennsylvania, but It is not
believed there will be any further at
tempts by the Boston and Montana to
enjoin the rival company until the Su
preme Court hands down its opinion in
the main case.
Imports Into the Philippines.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 2.â Secretary Root
to-day declined to express an opinion as
to the effect of the insular decisions in
the Supreme Court to-day until he has
had an opportunity to read them In fulL
Figures obtained at the War Department
end Treasury Bureau of Statistics rela
tive to the trade affected show that from
the beginning of United States occupancy
of the Philippines, August 22, 1838, up to
June 30 last, the total Imports into the
Philippines from the United States were
valued at $L607.4S6, while during the same
period the imports from Spain were val
ued at J1.993,9'jO. On the other hand, the
Imports into the United States from the
Phillppir.es from September 1 1S98, to De
cember 1, 1901, aggregated $15,448,600. But
of this large total only $1,894,523 consisted
jef dutiable goods, bo that the refund on
1 these would not be large.
WASHINGTON. Dee. 2.â Chief Justice Ful
ler announced to-day that after the session
Â©f the court on Monday next a recess would
be taken for four weeks, the court to recon
vene Jar.UE.ry S.
*hall have enacted and put into operation a
system of local taxation to meet the necessi
ties of the Government of Porto Rico by this
act established' and shall by resolution duly
passed so notify the President, he shall make
proclamation thereof and thereupon all tariff
duties on merchandise and articles coin? into
Porto Rico shall ceaee. and from and after
euch date all such merchandise and articles
shall be entered at the several ports of entry
free of duty."
And by section 4 "the duties and taxes col
lected In Porto Rico in pursuance of this act
â¢ â¢ â¢ shall not be covered Into the gen
eral fund of the Treasury, but shall be held
as a separate fund and shall be placed at the
disposal to be used for the government and
benc/lt of Porto Rico until the Government of
Porto Rico, herein provided for, shall have
been organized, when all moneys theretofore
collected under the provisions hereof then un
expended shall be transferred to the local
treasury of Porto Rico."
Now, there can be no doubt whatever that if
the Legislative Assembly of Porto Rico should
with the consent of Conrress lay a tax upon
poods arriving from ports of the United States
such tax if lesally Imposed would be a duty
upon imoorts to Porto Rico and not upon ex
ports from the United States, and we think
the same result must follow if the duty be
laid by Conrress in the interest and for the
benefit of Porto Rico.
Only 'Temporary Legislation.
The truth Is that in Imposing: the duty as a
temporary expedient with a proviso that it
may be abolished by the Legislative Assem
bly of Porto Rico at its will, Congress there
by shows that It is undertaking to legislate
for the island temporarily and only until the
local grovemment is put into operation. The
mere fact that the duty passes through the
hands of the revenue officers of the United
States Is immaterial in view of the require
ment that it shall not be covered into the
general fund of the Treasury, but held as a
separate fund for the government and benefit
cf Porto Rico.
The exaction is really correlative to that of
Downs vs. Bidwell, in which we held that
Congress could lawfully impose a duty on im
ports from Porto Rico, notwithstanding the
provision of the constitution that all duties,
imposts and excises shall be uniform through
out the United States.
It is true that this conclusion was reached
by a majority of the court by different pro
cesses of reasoning, but it is not the less true
that the conclusion that certain provisions of
the constitution did anply to Porto Rico and
that certain others did not, there was no dif-
It Is not intended hy this opinion to inti
mate that Congress may lay an export tax
upon merchandise carried from one State to
another. While this does not seem to be for
bidden by the express words of the constitu
tion. It would be extremely difficult if not
impossible to lay such a tax without a viola
tion of the first paragraph of article 1. sec
tion 8, that 'â¢all duties. Imposts and excises
shall be uniform throughout the United
States." V>' ;-- >;
There Is a wide difference between the full
and paramount power of Congress in legislat
ing for a. Territory in the condition of Porto
Rico and Its power with respect to the States,
which is merely incidental to its right to resfu
late Interstate commerce. The question, how
ever, is not involved in this case, and we do
not desire to express an opinion upon it. There
duties were properly collected and the action
of the Circuit Court In sustaining the de
nyarrer to the complaint was correct, and it is
therefore affirmed.
Chief Justice Puller Dissents.
Chief Justice Fuller and Justices Brewer,
Harland and Peckham unite in a dissent
ing opinion in the case. The opinion was
read by the Chief Justice and was based
largely on the constitutional provisions
concerning: the regulation of commerce.
He said In part:
The power to regulate interstate commerce
was granted in order that trade between the
States might be left free from discriminating
legislation and not impart the power to create
antagonistic commercial relations between
them. The prohibition of preference , of ports
was coupled -with the prohibition of taxation'
on article* exported. The citizens of each State
were declared "entitled to all privileges and
immunities of citizens m the several States"
and that Included the right of ingress and
egress and the enjoyment of the privileges of
trade and commerce.
The prohibition on Congress is explicit and
noticeably different from the prohibition of the
States. The State Is forbidden to "lay any Im
posts or duties:" Congress Is forbidden to lay
"any tax or duty." The State Is forbidden from
laying imposts or duties on "Imports or ex
ports": that is, articles coming into or going
out of the United States. Congress Is forbidden
to tax "articles exported from any State."
Taking up the plea that the duties in
this case were laid not on articles ex
ported from the State of New York, but
on articles imported into Porto Rico, the
Chi*f Justice said the language used pre
cludes this contention. The geographical
origin of the shipments controls, and it is
not material whether the duties were col
lected at the place of exportation or at
Porto Rico. They were imposed on arti
cles exported from the State of New York
and before the articles had reached their
ultimate destination and had been min
gled with the common mass of property
on the island.
The dissenting opinion concludes as fol
lows:
The proposition that because the proceeds of
these duties were to be used for the benefit of
Porto Rico they might be regarded as if laid
by Porto Rico itself, with the consent of Con
gress, and were therefore lawful, will not bear
examination.
Oor.gress may- lay local taxes in the terri
tories, affecting persons and property therein,
or authorize territorial legislatures to do bo,
but it cannot lay tariff duties on articles ex
ported from one State to another, or from any
*<tate to the territories or from any State to
foreign countries, or grant a power in that
regrard -which it does not possess. But the de
cision now made recognizes such powers in
Congress as will enable â  it, by means of tax
ation, to exclude the products of Porto Rico
fiom the States as well as the products of the
States from Porto Rico: and this, notwith
t<tanding it was held in De Lima vs. Bidwelli
that Porto Rico after the ratification of the
treaty with Spain ceased to be foreign and be
came domestic territory. ,
We thlnk.lt clear on this record that plain
tiffs werÂ» entitled to recover and that the
judgment should be reversed.

CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,' N.

being experienced by the United States
in reaching an agreement with Denmark
for the transfer to this Government
the Danish West Indies. Secretary Hay
and Minister Brun, Danish Minister, have
been endeavoring to settle two Important
pointsâ the price and the relations resi
dents of the Islands shall bear to this
Government -when the sale is made. The
report from Copenhagen that an agree
ment has been reached and the price de
termined upon is untrue. No decision
as to price has been fixed. The United
States is willing to pay about $3,(W0 000
but no more. The question of the status
of the- residents of the Islands after
American sovereignty has been extend
ed over the territory Is on the eve of
settlement. They will not be admitted
as full-fledged citizens.

UNCLE SAMâ Gentlemen, Walk In and Do Your Best.
BILLS AGAINST ANARCHY
ARE COMING TO THE FRONT
Jt^~ l ALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
// W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.âAn
il ti-anarchist bills are coming to
the front thick and fast, and it is
now probable that some legisla
tion In this connection will be among the
early acts of Congress. Among the first
of bills will be that of Representative
Graham of Pennsylvania, which will be
presented to-morrow in the House. It
provides: : ; "â â¢'â¢â 
Firstâ That any person belonging to a
society which countenances in writing
the taking of human life shall be deemed
an anarchist, and. . *â  â¢" '
Secondâ That any anarchist, as thus de
fined, who shall attempt the life of any
person holding a United States office, ex
ecutive or appointive, shall, on conviction
in the United States, be sentenced to
death by hanging.
It was estimated by officials of the
House that over 3000 bills had been intro
duced before 12 o'clock to-day. There
was much rivalry for the honor of having
bill No. 1, no less than fifteen members
having asked for this precedence.
The indications are that the bill of Me-

PEACE TREATY MAKES
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS
DOMESTIC TERRITORY
Chief Justice. Fuller Decides the Diamond
Ring Cases Against the United States
Government.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.-Opin
ions were rendered in the Su
preme Court to-day in the
last two of the insular test
cases. One of ,thexn. the case
of Emil J. Pepke against the United
States, is better known as the "fourteen
diamond ring case." and involved the re
lationship of the United States to the
Philippine Islands from a tariff point of
view. The other case, known as the
Dooley case No. 2, involved the constitu
tionality of the collection of duty on
goods shipped from New York to Porto
Rico.
In the former case the court, tnrougn
Chief Justice Fuller, held that thedla
mond rings brought In from the. Philip
pines and over which the case arose
should have been exempt from duty un
der" the Paris treaty of peace, as that
treaty made the Philippines American
territory. The decision in the Philippine
case followed closely that of the first
Porto Rican case in the last term.
In. the Dooley case decided to-day it
was held that the duty collected on
goods carried from New York to Porto
Rico was permissible, but that it was in
reality a tax for the benefit of the Porto
Ricans themselves, rather than an export
duty, as was claimed by the merchants
who antagonized the Government.
In both cases there were dissenting
opinions concurred in by four of the nine
Justices of the court.
The decisions were rendered In the
room of the Senate Committee on Ju
diciary, where the court is sitting tem
porarily, and owing to the limited space
there were comparatively few persons
present.
1 The delivery of the opinions in chief,
with the reading of the dissenting opin
ions, consumed a little more than an
hour, and it was listened to with the
closest attention. â¢ , . . .
It is generally believed that the find
ing in the Philippine case will lead to
early efforts to secure legislation for
the regulation of our commercial rela
tions with those islands. As the Porto
Rican opinion sustains the constitution
ality of the Foraker act, no such neces
sity 'Will arise with reference to Porto
Rico.
History of the Pepke Case.
The. record in the Pepke case shows
that Pepke. who was the respondent ta
the court below, was a soldier in the
army of the United States in the island
of Luzon; that while there and after the
ratification of the peace treaty he pur
chased the fourteen diamond rings which
are involved in the case. He afterward
brought the rings, while still in the ser
vice of the United States, aboard a United
States vessel transporting his regiment to
San Francisco, where he was mustered
out. Later he went with the rings to
Chicago, where the rings were seized by
the customs officials under the claim
that the Philippines were foreign terri
tory and merchandise brought from those
islands was subject to duties. Pepke set
ud the claim that customs duties on mer
chandise under the circumstances were
contrary to the United States laws and
in violation of his rights as a citizen.
The case came to the Supreme Court
from the District Court of the United
States for the Northern Division of Illi
nois. In that court the facts set up in
Peoke's plea were admitted by a demur
rer filed by the United States, and that
courr sustained the demurrer, overruling
the plea and entering Judgment against
the merchandise seized and directing that
it be sold In accordance with the law, and
from this decision the present writ of er
ror was prosecuted.
In his opinion In the case. Chief Jus
tice Fuller said that the Philippine Isl
ands ceased to be foreign territory as
soon as the Paris treaty of peace was
signed and the resolution to which he
referred as being ineffective was the res
olution adopted by the Senate soon after
the ratification of the treaty. r -
After stating the case at some length.
Chief Justice Fuller quoted somewhat ex
tensively from the opinion of this court
In the case of De Lima vs. Bidwell. His
principal quotation from that case was
the paragraph, setting forth the theory
that a country remains foreign with re
spect to the tariff laws until Congress
has acted by embracing it within the
customs. The opinion then continued as
follows: f
Philippines Are Domestic Territory.
Â«No reason Is perceived for any different rul
ing as to the Philippines. By the third article
of the treaty. Spain ceded to the United States
â¢â¢the archipelago known as the Philippine
Islands," and the United States asrreed to
pay to Spain the sum of $20,000,000 within three
months: The treaty was ratified; Congress ap
propriated the money; the ratification was pro-
claimed. The treaty-making power, the execu
tive power, the legislative power, concurred in
the completion of the transaction.
The Philippines thereby ceased in the lan
guage of the treaty to be "Spanish." Ceasln*
to be Soanlsh. they cease to be foreign coun
try. They came under the complete and abso
lute sovereignty and dominion of the United
States and bo became territory of the United
States, over which civil eovernment could be
exercised. The result was the same, although
there wu no stipulation that the native in
habitants should be Incorporated Into . the body
politic and none securing to them the right to
choose their nationality. Their allegiance be
came due to the United States and they be
came entitled to its protection.
But it is caid the case of the Philippines is
to be distinguished from that of Porto Rio
because on February 14. 1899. after the rati
fication of that treaty the Senate resolved that
by the ratification of the treaty of peace with
Spain it Is not Intended to Incorporate the in
habitants of the Philippine Islands into the
citizenship of the United States nor to per
manently annex those island*.
"We need not consider the force and effect ot
a resolution of this sort. If adonted toy Con
gress, not like that of April 20. 1898. In respect
to Cuba, preliminary to the declaration of war.
but after title had been passed by ratified ces
sion. It is enough that this was a Joint reÂ«o
lutlon; that it was adopted by the Senate by a
vote of 26 to 22. not two-thirds of a quorum.
and that it Is absolutely without lesral signi
ficance on the question before us. The mean
ing of the treaty cannot be controlled by sub
sequent exDlanations of some of tnoÂ»e
who may have, voted to ratify it. "WTja*
view tie House mleht have taken as to th3
Intention of the Senate In- ratifying the treaty
we are not informed, nor is It material, and II
any Indication from the action referred to
could nroperly *Â» Indulged. It would seem
to be that two-thirds of a quorum of the Sen
ate did not consent to the ratification on the
grounds indicated.
Sovereignty of Spain Ceases.
â  It Is farther contended that a distinction ex
ists in that, while complete possession of Porto
Rico was taken by the United States, this was
not so as to the Philippines, because of the
armed resistance of the native Inhabitants to
a greater or less extent.
â¢ We must decline to assume that the Govern
ment wishes thus to disparage the title of the
United States or to place itself to the position
of waging a war of conquest. _j_ â. ,
The sovereignty of Spain over the Philippine*
and possession under claim of title had existed
for a Ions series of years prior to the â war wltn
the United States. The fact that there were
insurrections against her or that uncivilized
tribes may have defied her will did not affect
the validity* of her title. She granted the isl
ands to the United States and the grantee. In
accepting them, took nothing less than the
whole grant. If those in insurrection against
Spain continued in insurrection against the
United States the legal title and possession of
the latter remained unaffected.
We do not understand that It la claimed that
In carrying on the pending hostilities the Gov
ernment Is seking to subjugate the people of a
foreign country, but on the contrary that It la
preserving order and suppressing Insurrection
in territory of the United States. It follows that
the Jurisdiction of the United States Is ade
quate and this cannot be admitted for one pur
pose and denied for another. It Is sought to
detract from the weight of the ruling in De
Lima versus Bidwell because one of the five
Justices concurring in the Judgment In the ease
concurred In the Judgment In Downi versus
Bidwell.
In De Lima versus Bidwell Porto Rico was
held not to be a foreign country, after cession,
and that a prior act exclusively applicable to
foreign countries became inapplicable.
In Downs versus Bidwell ; the conclusion of
a majority of the court was that an act of
Congress levying duties on goods Imported from
Porto Rico into New York not in conformity
with the provisions of the constitution in re
spect to the imposition of duties, imposts and
excises was valid. Four of the members of the
court dissented from and five concurred in the
decision, though not on the same grounds. The
Justice who delivered the opinion In De Lima's
case was one of the majority and was of opin
ion that although by the concession Porto Rico
ceased to be a forelgun country and became
territory of the United States and domestic,
yet that It was merely "appurtenant" terri
tory and not a part of the United State* with
in the revenue clauses of the constitution.
Court Orders the Decree Reversed.
This view placed the territory, though not
foreign, outside of the restrictions applicable to
Interstate commerce and treated the power of
Congress when affirmatively exercised over a
territory, situated as supposed and uncontrolled
by the provisions of the constitution In re
spect of national taxation. The distinction was
drawn between a special act in respect of the
particular country and a general and prior act
only applicable to countries foreign to ours In
every sense. The latter was obliged to con
form to the rule of uniformity, which was whol
ly disregarded In the former.
The ruling in the case of De Lima remained
unaffected and controls that under considera
tion. And this Is so notwithstanding four mem
bers of the majority in the De Lima case wero
of the opinion that Porto Rico did not become
by the cession subjected to the exercise of gov
ernmental power in the levy of duty unre
stricted by constitutional limitations.
Decree reversed and case remanded with di
rections to quash the information.
Justices Gray, "White, Shiras and Me-
Kenna united in dissenting from the
court's opinion in the Philippine case, but
they filed no written statement beyond a
mere note in which they said that they
"dissented for the reasons stated in their
opinions in the case of De Lima vs. Bid
well, Dooley vs. the United States and
Downs vs. Bidwell in the last term of the
court."

SWIMS TO SHORE
WITH HER BABES
Squaw's Rescue of Three
Pappooses Proves
Futile.
Little Ones Saved From
Drowning Die of Expos
ure on the Beach.
Special Dispatch to The Call;
VANCOUVER, Dec 2.â A drowning ac
cident, accompanied by a noteworthy ex
ample of heroism, occurred in the North
Arm of the Inlet this afternon. A boat
in which were an Indian from the Catho
lic Mission, his wife and three children
and another squaw, capsized in- a squall.
The Indian and the second squaw went
down with the boat, while the mother
of the pappooses seized one under each
arm and the third in her teeth and swim
to the shore, a distance of 150 or 200 yards.
Such an act has rarely been equaled and
the fact that it was performed by an
Indian woman speaks well for the trair
lng of the aborigines and their skill in
the water. But the saddest part remains
to be told. After , gaining the beach the
three pappooses died from the effects of
exposure, despite all that could be done
by white loggers who came to the brave
woman's assistance.
Tt.fi Indian was a brother of Chief Har
ry of the Mission across the inlet and
was proceeding to a lumber camp at the
farthest end of the North Arm. His chil
dren were aged 6 years, 4 years and 3
months, respectively. When the party
â was nearly at its destination a squail
blew down from the hills and put the boat
on her beam ends. She made considerable
water and righted herself, but immediate
ly afterward went down suddenly. The
Siwash was clothed in an oil skin and
heavy gum boots, besides having- his
cartridge belt about his waist and he
sank straight away. His squaw on com
ing to the surface found â¢ the children
within easy reach. Taking one under
each arm and seizing the clothing of the
baby with her teeth, she struck out for
the shore. Kathleen, the other squaw,
was also a cwlmmer, but > succumbed to
the coldness of the water and sank soon
after the boat went down.
It was a long swim and a hard one to
the shore, which was nearly 200 yards
from the spot where the accident oc
curred. With that desperation prompted
by the maternal Instinct to save her lit
tle ones, the mother buffeted the wind
and the. choppy sea bravely and finally
succeeded in reaching the beach. How she
did It she does not know. William Mearns
of Phipps* logging- camp saw - her strug
gle and went to her assistance. The
squaw was utterly exhausted when she
landed and deposited her precious bur
dens on the beach.
But the mother's heroism was to no ef
fect. Her first thought was for the wel
fare of her children and on turning her
attention to them she found the youngest
vomiting water. It died shortly after
ward from the effects of its exposure in
the water. The other two boys were also
thoroughly chilled, and though aid was
sought from the, nearest camp it did not
come soon enough to relieve them from
the effects of the exposure. They ' died
within an hour. â¢ . ,, â 
The funeral of the little ones will take
place to-morrow, and all of. the white
residents in that vicinity will attend.

DEATH ENDS C HARITABLE LIFE
OF MRS. MARGARET E. CROCKER
Philanthropic California Woman Succumbs in New
York to Pneumonia After a Long Illness.
SA.CRAMENTO, Dec. 2.â Private dis
patches from New York announce
the death of Mrs. Margaret E.
: Crocker,- widow of the late Judge
E. B. Crocker, in that city, yester
day... She succumbed to pneumonia, after
a long illness, at the age of 79 years. To
morrow the body will be taken to Buffalo
and there cremated, this being Mrs.
Crocker's wish.
It was in this city Mrs. Crocker spent
the best and happiest years of her life.
It was here that her children were born
and reared and itVas here that her phil
anthropy found freest expression. The
magnificent Crocker â¢ art gallery of 700
paintings and several thousand pen and
ink studies from the studios jof Europe,
the whole representing a value of $750,000,
was her gift to the city of Sacramento, for
the free use of the people for all time.
Her establishment and endowment of the
Marguerite Home for Old Ladies, at an
outlay of $130,000, was another notable in
stance of her bounty. Recently she deed
ed to a modest local charity, for the pur
pose of a rescue home, her beautiful man
sion- at Third and O streets, rich with its
laurel and- maple and fine marbles.
Mrs. Crocker's gift of the art gallery to
the people was followed, on May 6, 1885, by
a floral festival' in her honor, which has

SAN DIEGO, Dec. | 2.â R. H. Hall and
the woman who has passed here as , his
sister, -Bessie Hali;-and In other; places
as his wife, but who -is .said to be Mrs.
Bessie Groch of Sanderson, .Tex., are in
jail here on ' a charge ' of grand larceny,
preferred by W. H. H. Stowell of New
York. â¢ The larceny complained of was
unique in its way, -the charge being that
the couple opened the baggage of Stowell
and his wife at the Santa Fe depot in
this city, where Hall was the night oper
ator, and abstracted' therefrom between
$2509 and $3000 worth of set diamonds. The
theft -was -not discovered until after Hall
had t been J arrested ; on a charge of. petty
larceny, preferred by C. Niemann, from
whose valise he is said to ' have', stolen , a
revolver and a pair of driving gloves.; -
When the news, of.- the theft. of the re
volver was printed Mr.: Stowell and his
wife, who were stopping at the Coronado
Hotel, - opened . their valises and , trunks,
which had. been, left ' for "several , days â¢ in
the -.baggage-room at the. depot' and dis
covered^ the absence of- : the . diamonds.
They reported the | loss to Agent - Steuart
and,"; through r him, .-to. the " Police â¢ Depart
ment, with. the result that through Detec
tive Cooley one .' of â¢ the ; rings, : : valued at
$500, was found in the possession of Hall's
attorney, to, whom it had' been- given as a
probably never' found its like anywhere
in the- world. A holiday, season was be
gun throughout the city, factories and
business houses closed, as did all the
schools. The churches and all fraternal
societies ' participated. The path of Mrs.
Crocker through the streets was strewn
with roses by thousands of children dress
ed in white. * .
Wonderland of Flowers.
At the great State Exposition building,
which covers several acres ! of Capitol
Park, such a .scene was produced as sug
gested ., a fairyland vision. The whole
place was redolent of perfume, aglow with
the- rarest blossoms.- Flowers were fash
ioned into churches, pagodas and temples,
all of them capable of holding scores . of
persons. In the- center of the great en
closure was a maypole, around which a
hundred' or more children danced as they
wound the gay- ribbons. The gardens of
Sacramentoâ and not alone Sacramento,
but of surrounding townsâ had been strip
ped of their choicest blooms in order that
the day should be ever memorable. ,
Fully 15,000 persons filled the pavilion
and joined in the acclaim in honor of
Mrs. Crocker. Three thousand school
children passed before her, tossing roses
at her feet as they went. In the evening
the festival was renewed. ,The Sacra
mento Society of California Pioneers pre
sented her with four tablets of solid gold

fee in the petty larceny case. Other jewels
have been found where Hall had pawned
them, besides considerable other plunder
of more or less value, which evidently
had been obtained In the same way. '
Hall's bail has been fixed at $5000 and
that of the woman at $2500. ' '
Detective Silva. of the SarttavFe, who
was sent here -to investigate the loss of
several articles about the Hotel Coronado,
supplies the^ other portion of the story.
A week ago 1 he was asked by the Chief
of Police of Albuquerque to locate R. H.
Hall, a telegraph operator from Shawnee,
N. Mex.< and the woman who was passing
as his wife. The Albuquerque officer wrote
that the woman was the wife of D. E.
Groch of Sanderson, Tex. ; that the couple
had eloped from there; that the husband
had followed them to Shawnee and had
exchanged shots with Hall in an im
promptu duel,, in which neither was hit.
When â  Silva came here to investigate a
petty larceny case he did not know that
Hall was here,' but when he learned the
fact, he was -sure that the local detec
tive, had the right man. The diamond
charge came later and the officials are
â¢confident that other- sensations will 'de
velop.' â â¢'â '". .â¢'â â¢-

When Amy Crocker, their daughter, was
budding into womanhood the reception
halls of the art gallery were the scene of
the most brilliant social events this city
ever beheld.
After giving the art gallery to the city
Mrs. Crocker spent most of the time with
her daughter Amy, then Mrs. Porter Ashe,
and her daughter Jennie. Mrs. J. Sloat
Fassett nf New York. Another daughter
Is Mrs. Jackson Gourand of New York.
Her visits became less and less frequent
and finally ceased altogether when she

her daughters in the East, several rel

are nieces. Mrs. W. F. Dillman and Mrs.

OUT OF COURT
Judge Harrington Disci
plines Counsel for
Lynchers.
Checks Verbal Attack Upon
Deputy Attorney General
' Post.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALTURAS, Dec. 2.â Each day has its
exciting feature in the trial of James TV.
Brown, the alleged leader of the mob
that hanged aged Calvin Hall, his three
sons and Daniel YantisMn Lookout. Dur
ing the morning? session of the court Dep
uty Attorney General C. N. Post aroused
the ire of counsel for the defense by de
claring his belief that the entire commu
nity of Lookout was in a measure respon
sible for the crime. Judge G. F. Harris,
for the defense, resented this statement
and his language became so violent that
he was ordered out of the courtroom by
Judge Harrington. The Attorneys Raker,
who are associated with Harri3 as coun
sel for Brown, took up the fis^t and were
rtnally compelled to take their seats or
sutler for contempt of court.
Post's words were called forth by the
fact that almost every venireman who is
examined declares that he believes the
lynching of the nve men was Justifiable,
'ihe case began a week ago and thus far
only tour jurors have been sworn. It 13
liKeiy tnat several special venires will ba
exhausted and two weeks may elapse be
tore the full jury is chosen. The pre
ponderance of puollc sentiment is in the
lynchers' favor ,and the Ieeltng against
tne prosecutionâ especially counsel rep
resencing the Stateâ grows more bitter
each da.'.
Only lour talesmen were examined to
day.. J. A. Winer of Lake City de
clared that from all he had read
and heard of the lynching he believed it
was **a good job well done." He believed
there are times when the lynching of
rough characters such as the Lookout vicÂ»
tims was not only justifiable but good for
the community. He was challenged by
the prosecution and excused under ob
jection of the defense.
L. M. Henderson, like the preceding
venireman. said he had lived a good many
years in Modoc County and he did "not
believe that Modoc citizens would hang
any man unless they had good grounds
for so doing. Henderson is a rancher and
a son of Supervisor Martin Henderson.
George Sweeney of Lake City and John
A. Dyke of Cedarville entertained views
similar to those expressed by their two
predecessors.
.W. W. Williams, who was passed yes
terday, was re-examined by Post for the
prosecution as to his supposed sympathy
with defendants. Williams said that if
the men hanged were not cattle thieve*
he would judge Impartially from the evi
dence, but if they were thieves he would
not like to convict the lynchers.
The defense re-examined Gahey, who
also was passed yesterday. Gahey said
he was opposed to mob law and that he
was friendly with Calvin Hall, who was
hanged. The defense then used a. peremp
tory challenge on Gahey and retained
Wilder and W. ,W. Williams, who were
sworn to try the case. These make four
jurors obtained since the case commenced.

Proposed to Exclude Whites

STOCKTOX, Dec. 2.â There is soon to
be a big negro colony in Contra. Costa
County, just across the line from San
Joaquln. It will consist of SOO families
from Louisiana. \-\ .V : : .'vi'.-
Negotiations have been in progress sev
eral weeks and the bargain haÂ» practi
cally been struck for 3000 acres of lan<M
Later an additional tract of 13.000 acres
will be thrown open to the negroes. The
present understanding is that only the
advance guard of the black brigade shall
come until the first comers have had ex
perience enough to determine whether the
venture will be satisfactory to all cou
cerned.
It is expected that agents of the col
onists will arrive here this week, or early
next week, to close the deal. The land iÂ«
owned by John Herd and lies on the west
side of the river, which constitutes part
of the dividing: line between San Joaquin
and Contra Costa. It will be divided into
tracts of from ten to fifty acres. The set
tlers will raise garden produce, which
may readily be shipped to market, inas
much as the Santa Fe line runs through
the tract, and there is also communica
tion by water.
The colonists want a place where they
may live exclusively. The nearest town,
Brentwood. is several miles away. ThÂ»v
propose to incorporate a town, elect their
own officers, establish a school district
and, in short, control the government of
the colony.

London, Dec 2. â Thomas Peterson
Goudie. the bookkeeper of the Bank of

of the disccverey that the bank had been
robbed of about Â£170,000, was captured to
day at Bootle, where he had been in hid

two of whom. "Dick." Burge, the pugilist.
and F. T. Kelly, the bookmaker of Brad

them. .
Hundreds of people clamored for admis
sion into the courtroom at Bow street,
hardly cr.pable of holding those directly
inter- <6 'n the case.
Char* lathews, counsel for the vic
timized .:ik, in presenting the case
against me prisoners, gave the first au
thentic details of the fra.uds. He ex
plained that there had been twenty-seven
checks forged. The first two affected
Goudie. The next twelve, representing in
value Â£25,300. would be mainry traced to
Kelly. Another seven checks, aggregat
ing Â£53,000. would be first traced to Kelly
and afterward to Kelly and another per
con not yet before the court. Six other
checks, valued at Â£51,000, would be traced
first to Lawrie Marks, who paid them
into his bank accounts. But some of the
proceeds were also traceable to Burg-c.
The whole amount had been drawn out
of the Bank of Liverpool by checks
drawn to account of G. W. Hudson.
Evidence was then presented to show
that Lawrie Marks opened an account
with the Credit Lyonais at the end of 1S39.
In October. 1901. he paid In the first Hud
son check, amounting to Â£5000. Later he
introduced Burge, who opened an ac
count. After the first Hudson check was
paid in, in October, Marks deposited two
more Hudson checks, for Â£16.000. On
November 1 Burge. accompanied by
Marks, cashed a check for Â£13,000. recelv-
L Ing Â£7000 in notes. The same day the
f identical notes were deposited by James
Mances, whom Marks had in the mean
while introduced at the bank. Marks,
November 4, deposited a Hudson check
for Â£30.000. and November 8 Burge pre
sented a check for Â£15.000. drawn by
Marks in his favor, while Mances. the
same day, cashed another of Marks'
checks for Â£10.000. A witness testified to
a number of similar transactions. "When
the bank was enjoined the amounts
standing to the credit of the accused
were: Burge. Â£13,585; Marks, Â£10,59L and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY; DECEMBER 3, I9O1.
AUTOLIG HT IS AN ABSENTEE
AND OBIA WIN5 GALLOPING
P, Ryan's Mare I^uns Away From Qalanthus=-=E1 Rey
Beaten Out by J. N. nburicei's Disturber.
AMONG other things on the menu
at Oakland track yesterday was
the free handicap for three-year
olds : over a mile and a. furlong.
The track was fearfully muddy,
so Green Morris decided to let Autolight
stay in the stable. This caused it to sim
mer down to a battle between the three
lightweights, Obia, Galanthus . and Bru
tal. Galanthus had -promenaded out In
front of three fields, but they all lacked
class; still, for a time, he ruled the fa
vorite. Then keener judgment prevailed,
which, taken together with P. Ryan's
money, made Obia close a 4Â»to 5 chance.
J. Ransch had the leg up on the latterâ
the first mount since his accident. lie
received a pretty ovation from the stand
and returned the compliment by , going
out and winning all the way. Brutal came
strong at the finish and was only beaten
two lengths for the place by Galanthus.
While but two favorites succeeded \ in
passing the wire first, there appeared to
be considerable wise I money afloat, and
â¢many of the books quit loser on the play.
The attendance was large, as usual.
After many trials the Inverness colt.
Senator Bruce, left the maiden class in
the opening two-year-old . scramble. ' Bull
man took a trick at the wheel and the
chestnut fellow led from start to finish.
The Maniac, an 8 to 1 shot, downed,Ma
jor Bird for the place. ' â â  â 
By his ridiculous win of the six and a
half furlong sprint it would seem as if
sloppy going was the long suit of Dide
rot. Jack Atkin's gelding was as good
as 6 to 5 for the second number and sim
ply galloped in ahead of Herculean and
Ben Ledi. Sea Lion was an indifferent
fourth. . â¢ . . ' â¢
To Birkenruth's bulldog tenacity-Tin
clinging to the rail position can be. aa
cribed the win of theflve furlong scram
ble for two-year-olds by St. Sever. A fur
long from the stand he looked hopelessly
shut off, but gradually wedged his way
through and at the wire beat Sol half a
length. Dr. Scharff, the â¢ favorite, - on
which Spencer had the mount, did not
get a very good send off, finishing fourth.
Billy Magrane's piece of vocal equine
furniture. The Singer, made his company
in the mile selling race look like - low
notes. Going to the post third choice the
geding came home the easiest sort of a
winner over Hohenlohe and Rose of Hilo.
The latter jnare closed, favorite, but her
chances were not improved by the start.
Nothing but Disturber had much chance
in the final seven furlong dash. Mounce
had the mount on his father's gelding and
played for a good thing beat the barrier
three lengths. With an equal break El
Rey, which finished second, would have
won. Plohn; the favorite, proved a dis
appointment and "Wyoming was not
straight when the barrier was released.
Track Notes.
Jake Holtman will now take his turn
at . the starting gate for the next two
weeks.. With one exception his work yes
terday was excellent.
The win of St. Sever proved costly for
Dr. Rowelh The two-year-old was en
tered to be* sold for $500 and Tom Ryan
boosted him a similar amount. It appears
that the doctor tilted one of the Ryan
string at Chicago last summer and the
genial "Tom" forgot not.
Birkenruth, it must be conceded, is one
of the best boys now riding at Oakland.
If in his predicament on St. Sever nine,
out of ten riders would have given up
the ghost a furlong from the stand, but
"Birk" persevered and won out by halt
a length. It was. a nervy piece of work.
Al â¢Ralston, a well-known laver of
prices, arrived from New York on last
evening's overland.
At the Occidental Horse Exchange to
night there will be a great sale of year
lings, two and three-year-olds and horses

FIGHT AGAINST
CONSOLIDATION
Minnesota Officials Are
Preparing Legal
Papers.
ST. PAUL, Dec. 2.â The following state
ment was given to the Associated Press
at the Governor's office late this after
noon: .
â¢ "Governor Van Sant reports that he has
been informed by Attorney General Doug
lass that from the investigation made he
has decided to institute legal proceedings
In opposition to the proposed consolidation
of railway Interests, and that the papers
are in process of preparation." i
Copies of the annual report of the Great
Northern Railway, filed with the State
Railroad and ijyarehouse Commission, ac
cording to a State law, were forwarded to
the Attorney General to-day, with the re
quest of the commissioners that he bring
an action to compel the company to fur
nish reports showing operations in Minne
sota for the last fiscal year upon a mile
age basis.
The Great Northern for several years
has not furnished this information, insert-
Ing in the reports the statement:
"This company has abandoned as Im
practicable and misleading the plan of
making divisions, on interstate earnings
between the States through which the
system runs, and cannot therefore give
iigures purporting to show earnings in
.Minnesota from such traffic."
Tables were given showing business
purely local to the State.
It is asserted by the commissioners that
the refusal to furnish figures of Minne
sota's proportion of interstate traffic re
daces the apparent earnings for the last
fiscal year from a figure in excess of $19,
000,000 to J4.847.382.

Secretary Wilson was greeted with liwd
applause. His remarks â were largely on
the importance of the cattle business in

cattle exports from this country were
worth $8,000,000 the great market was at
home, "among our own people, and under
our own flag." â¢ ~v :â  Â« .
"The horse," said the speaker, "is with
us to-night and he will be with us through
the ages when the automobile and bicycle

would own an automobile who understood
the beauties of the horse."

draws to its close. The attendance last
night, while not as great as at the Sun

Robert : Bowman had an easy time de
feating young Pockwitz. The victor
played in old-time form, killing at will
and taking the most difficult serves .with
either hand. His chances In the tourna
ment are very good," despite the fact that
he has already lost a gamw. - Oatis Crabie
wore the shoes of Champion Al Hampton
and played In great -.form. He defeated
Jack Tait without mussing his hair. Tait
was bothered by, the poor lights. Fritz

The feature of the evening was the play
ing of | Janes against Tom Powers, the
"Irish' Champion.". Janes had- played a
hard game the day before, but entered
the court in good shape. His hands both
ered him, however, and he was forced to
wear a glove. Powers won the first game
and rested -the second. In the third and
final game Janes plucked up hope and by
a difficult serve won from his opponent. -

children. But there can be no joy in
motherhood without health, and without
health for the mother there can be no
health for the child.
t It is of vital importance for women to
know that the health of mother and child
is in general - entirely within woman's
control. Th'e thousands of women who
have used Dr. Pierce's Favorite Pre-
scription when expecting motherhood,
have testified that it made them healthy
and happy in the days of waiting, made
the baby's advent practically painless,
and gave them health to give their chil-
dren.
Mrs. W. J. Kidder, of Hill Dale Farm (Enos-
burg Center), Enosburg. Vt., writes: Â« During the
past year I found myself expecting maternity,
and in rapidly failing health. I suffered dread-
fully from bloating and urinary difficulty. I
was growing perceptibly weaker each day and
suffered much sharp pain at times. ! I felt that
something must be done. I sought your advice
and received a prompt reply. Took twelve
bottles of Doctor Pierce's Favorite Prescription,
and also followed your instructions. I began
to improve immediately, my health became
excellent, and I could do all my own work (we
live on a good sized farm). I walked and rode
all I could, and enioyed it. I had a short, easy
confinement and have a healthy baby boy."

THE MONROE DOCTRINE.
S.EVERAL London newspapers express a desire
.that .England accept the Monroe, doctrine and
then' join' the -United. States in â¢ asking its ac
erycance~by the" btRer" nations" Of Europe. This is
conditioned upon our defining that celebrated doc
trine and asking Britain to accept it upon such defini
tion.^ \V< see no necessity for asking anybody to ac
cept the Monroe" doctrine. If seems to be doing
quite" vrell as a declaration of our' hegemony of this
hemisphere,, and will be made neither stronger nor
weaker by European acceptance.
As Jot. Great Britain, her interest in it is common
with ours. With her we now share ownership of the
, northern part of the hemisphere. While her do
minion does not cover as much territory . available
to man as ours, it cannot be said to be of less im
portance to her, for it is a great segment of her zone
around -the world, without which communication
between the antipodal parts. pf her empire would be
interrupted.
Besides that, the Monroe doctrine originated in a
British Ministry. When Lord Canning became aware
of the Holy Alliance, formed by secret treaty for the
purpose of aiding Spain in Tioldirfg or regaining her
grip on her fast fading possessions in America, he
suggested to Monroe and Adams what is now known
as the Monroe doctrine. His object was to com
pkte-the undoing of Spain, as a world power and a
rival- in; empire to Great Britain. reflection
one must see that this suggestion was really one of
the-highest manifestations in the last century of Brit
ish statesmanship. It prevented the rejuvenation of
Spain, avenged* the insults of Philip II, and, above all,
secured tile" .United States as a necessary ally in any
war/between England and the Continent that might
threaten her -loss 'of -Canada) since under the' plain
language of Monroe a transfer to another system of
that territory y;ould be held "an act unfriendly to the
United States." ; . . .'. 'S '
Considering its English -origin its. acceptance- by
Great- Britain ought rot to require much urging, and
jfeifrdo there will be. neither urging- nor acceptance.
If- the Spectator and other London newspapers will
indulge in a little retrospection they will observe that
their Government has already accepted that doctrine
which an English Cabinet formulated. More than
that, when Lord Salisbury accepted Mr. Cleveland's
clear-. cut *and- virile "construction of it by conceding ar
bitration of the Venezuelan boundary the doctrine
was, acknowledged in- its broadest feature.
It is no favor to us for any nation to formally
acknowledge, our hegemony of this hemisphere, since
our leadeiship can endure only while we have the
power to assert it against the world in arms. In 'our
strength we need no partnership, and in our weak
ness^if.it come, we will have none, no matter. what
nations may .previously .have accepted Monroeism.
Naturally -We are hand in hand with Great Britain in
the. matter. She owns ail. of the hemisphere she can
ever acquire, and in the affairs of nations two neigh
bors. are"better than' a multitude. ' With a South
American federation becoming every year more re
ntote and that patriotic. dream of Simon Bolivar gone
gj^nniiering, the dominating^ power he^e will be ours,
but England has the same interest that we have in
pixventing ,the .extension in this hemisphere of the
systems of any of her. rivals. ' :â 
llnasttjujilr as -thejinterests of the two; nations touch
palms at so many common points, let England pro
ceed to embossMn" her international policy the 'doc
trinc. .-MÂ° n . ro ? -Canning, so that next Fourth of July
we can celebrate it, among the. other, laudable 'events
of the vear. / **~
A clever young man in New York went to the city
prison, -permitted his hands and arms to be bound by
ten pairs. of handcuffs and his legs to be chained by
sbacMes in two place*, then', he'^ freed himself from "the
bontls^in just eleven "minutes. It would seem that
lifitiung Â£an hold the youth, but somebody slibuld put
h'inf'intd Wall street and give Morgan a lead pipe
cinch on him and then see what he would do.
OIL RATES REDUCED..
BY reasdn of the firm standtaken by Commis
sioners; Laumeister and Edson in the oil rate
cases the railroads have profited 'nothing by
the rehearing.. The decision of the commission is
this time.much more favorable to the public than was
the former one. The reductions are larger and are 1
more general in their application, and consequently
will give to the oil men and to consumers a greater
degree, of relief from railway extortion. ,â  -
The decision. of course is not final, for it is quite
probable the railroads will appeal to the courts to set
it aside and to grant an injunction against its enforce
ment until the appeal has been heard. In' fact; the,
objections made by Commissioner Blackstpck render
it almost certain the appeal will be made. Those
objectionshave a certain legal form that suggests the
fine Italian hand of Herrin. It' seems evident he will
make an appeal, if for no other purpose than that
of delay, so that he may still persuade the Southern
Pacific managers that he can be of. some use. to them.
That, fact, however, does not in any way diminish the
credit due. to the Commissioners who have resisted all
the blandishments and all the threats of the railway,
and who have given to the public" much' fairer rates
than the roads were willing to concede.
Unless the courts discover some technical flaw in
the decision. or in the proceedings of the hearing it
is not likely the decision will be set aside, for it is
clearly sustained by the evidence given before the
Commissioners. The rates imposed upon oil shippers
have been of the kind sanctioned by the policy of
making all rates as high as the traffic will' bear. The
reductions made will not prevent the railroads from
earning a fair profit on the oil they haul, but will give
the oil men a chance to get their goods' to market
at a not unreasonable cost. Thus the new rates prom
ise cheaper oil to consumers and better .profits for
producers without in any way wronging the roads. . \
The decision has a political as 1 well as a business
significance. The reduction in oil' rates is : tanta
mount to a reduction of Herrin. . It is now evident
that the astute attorney for the Southern Pacific does
not own the majority of the Railroad Commission.
He has not been able to cave Commissioner Edson
down the bank. That gentleman has not only stood
firmly by his decision in favor of reduction given at
the first hearing, but upon the fuller evidence brought
out at the recent hearing has voted for further re
ductions still. Herrin has done all he could and he
has failed. The commission is not to be pulled down.
Herrin's position is now extremely precarious. He
endeavored to get control of the municipal govern
ment, but- failed completely. In the new Board of.
Supervisors he will not have control of a single menij
ber.. His services to the water company and- to the
gas cdmpany will therefore be less valuable than they
have been in the past. It has been demonstrated that
he cannot control the Railroad Commission, and con
sequently the'Southern Pacific will have little use for
him. He has been clever enough to make use of the
Market-street Railway Company in promoting
schemes for the water company and, the gas* com
pany,.but now that. corporation will doubtless get rid
of him. In fact, there was never any reason jwhy the
Market-street company should have employed .the
attorney for the water and the gas corporations. The
Board of Supervisors does not fix street railway rates
every year, as it does water and gas rates, and conse
quently the Market-street company has' gained noth
ving by uniting with the two corporations to employ
an. attorney to fix. things with the Supervisors. It is
safe to say the Market-street company will not much
longer continue to pay a pro rata of Herrin's salary
for serving the water company and the gas company
and doing politics in their interests.
The defeat, of Herrin's effort to get the oil rates
restored by the Railroad Commission will probably
prove his Waterloo. By the. time Mr. Kruttschnitt
returns the new managers of the Southern Pacific
will probably have determined . that â  they cannot
longer find it' profitable to retain an attorney in com
bination with the water company and the gas com
pany. Mr. Herrin has been carrying too many
buckets of water on his shoulders. Something is

One of the good results of Roosevelt's ability to
compel every caller to come to the point at once and
state his request without waste of time is that it en
ables the President to finish with each in short order
and thus have time to see and v to hear another. In
consequence of that faculty he is said to be the most
approachable President we ever had. He listens 'to
no one very long, but he listens a little to all who
come. ,
CONDITIONS : IN MANILA.
DOWN in the capital city of the Philippines
there has been established an. American'
journal under the title TKe American Critic. '
We have seen only the. second number 'of the publi
cation^ but judging by that it is in the! hands of a :
live maii and he fills it as full of good substance as an
egg is full of meat. â  '.'if, . : v
' With genuine Americanism he devotes the most
extensive article in his paper to boasting about . the r
climate. We are informed that the Philippines have
a climate peculiar to themselves, that they "are not
like other islands on the same parallels of latitude.*
"'The climate is not only "suff erable but tolerable, not
only tolerable- but pleasant." As if this were not
enough the writer goes on to say: "the intense,
paralyzing . heat of June, July and August as .ex
perienced in the United States is unknown to the
Philippines.',' It appears that/ more . centenarians
have been discovered in Manila in" the' last three
years than in any other region of the earth, .and;
among' them are "one who is over 137 years of age,
and a mother who can boast. of a progeny of over
600 human souls."
As for prospects for Americans in the islands the
Critic says that at present there are very few com
mercial positions open in^ Manila. Living expenses
we. learn, are. much;. higher in Manila than\ in the
States, and to young Americans the general advice
is given: "It is far better. to stay at home- and sell
ribbons' at 10 cents a yard on a salary of^$10 a
week."
There are, however, chances for somebody. The
Critic asks: "Why does not'some energetic indi
vidual seeking large returns on a small capital start
a vegetable garden.- for supplying - the wants * of
Manila's American residents?" Of such a man it is
said: "Not only would he "profit .financially; .but he
would be hailed far and wide as a delivererâ one who
rescued his- fellow-beings from that awful
for green stuff that forces us to consume great quan
tities of poor garden truck which could' not obtain
recognition in an American market."
It is announced that 'American manufacturing

DEFECTIVE TIMBER LAW^
y*â^ CONSIDERABLE space is given in the report
I of the Secretary of the Interior to rec'oni-
N-"* mendations in favor of legislation designed to
regultte the sale and use of timber on the unappro
priated and unreserved public lands. It is stated that
the experience the department has had with the pres-.
ent law. is sufficient to, show, conclusively that unless
the law is; repealed or radically amended it will result
in the complete destruction of the timber on the un
appropriated and unreserved lands.
As an illustration of the defectiveness of the law
attention is directed to the section which provides
that any person who is prosecuted for trespass on the
public timbered lands may be relieved from prosecu
tion by paying a sum equal to $2 50 per acre for the
land on which the timber was' cut. Under that
clause the department reports four casts involving
720 acres of valuable timbered lands, the timber on
which was worth several thousand dollars, where the
offending parties escaped prosecution ;by paying the
wholly inadequate sum provided by the statute. -
In addition to f the inadequate penalty for the pun
ishment of trespassers the- law affords considerable
opportunities for fraud. The report says that during
the past year quite a number of these frauds have been
discovered. Prosecutions are .now pending against sev
eral offenders for perjury^ and subornation of perjury,
and suits have -been" instituted' to /vacate the patents
upon entries that were obtained by fraud embracing
upward of. 14,000 acres. By reason of all these de
fects the Secretary declares that the passage of a bet
ter'act on the subject is absolutely imperative to the
protection of the timber.
The matter is the more important because the
United States has no longer any forests that it can
afford to waste." Forest protection has, in fact, be
come a very live issue in this country, and the peo
ple are beginning to understand thevalue of wood
lands to the community as a whole.
Commenting upon the change in public sentiment
concerning forests, the report says: "The irrigators
of the West have been specially active in urging the
necessity of complete protection of .the forests. from
fire and other destructive agencies, and in asking that
the reserves beextended to include all areas of public
land from .which issue streams of importance .as
sources of water supply. The extreme drought in
many parts of -the country during the past year has
seriously diminished the flow- of the/ mountain
streams. , Together with the deplorable scarcity of
water in portions of the .West; during the three pre
ceding, years,, it has called public attention as never
before to' the vital necessity of forest preservation
and reforestation."
' Of!c0urse the preservation of the forest reserves
and the protection pi the unreserved timber lands are.
not identical problems,' but 'they have the common
end of checking the waste that- is going on among
the woods/ of ;the national domain.- Both subjects,
therefore, are deserving the immediate attention.;. of
Congress. As, the Secretary says, "Action is im
perative at the earliest possible date."
The" inability of humanity to see more than one
thing at a time is shown in the attention given to
Miss Stone and the complete indifference of the pub
lic to her companion, who was- kidnaped along' with
her. She is:in as great danger as Miss Stone and is
having just as hard a time,' but she gets no press no
tices, and if she took '.to lecturing -she could hardly
draw a crowd with free admission. ..
The recent order granting free admission of Christ
mas presents sent to officers or men in the army in
the Philippines, but. denying the privilege in the case
of gifts â  sent to employes of the civil government, is
hardly fair.. Uncle Sam is Vicfc enough and ought to
be broad enough to treat all his servants in the Phil
ippines alikel in little matters of that kind.
It was announced recently that a "prominent New
Yorker" has declared that; David Bennett Hill is the
logical Democratic; candidate for" the next Presidency,

name of the prominent one is not given, but it is safe

They Will Be of Larger
Displacement Than
Those in Use.
Secretary Long Sends a De
scription of Them to
Congress.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G street, N. W.,
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 2.âBattle
ships and armored cruisers of larger dis
placement than ever before built are pro
jected by the Navy Department.
Secretary Long has transmitted to Con
press a description of two battleships and
\ :wo armored cruisers, in accordance
with the provisions of the last naval ap
propriation. Each battleship will have a
maximum displacement at full load of
17.604 tons and each armored cruiser a
maximum displacement of 15,959 tons. The
battleships will be longer and have greater
beam than any in the United States navy.
Each ship will have length on its load
water line of 450 feet and an extreme
breadth on the local water line of 72 feet 8
inches. Regarding the sheathing and cop
pering, the Naval Board expresses the
opinion that "it is inadvisable to sheathe
and copper under the water the bodies of
armored vessels of large displacement."
Eleven inches is the maximum thickness
of the armor made by the Krupp process,
and all that is considered necessary or de
sirable for the battleships. In the case of
the armored cruisers, the maximum thick
ness has been reduced to six inches. As
regards the form of turret, the elliptical
balanced type with Inclined port plates is
considered the best. The board is of the
opinion that the most suitable types of
guns are those adopted for the ships un
der construction. It does not consider it
expedient to equip the battleships and
armored cruisers with torpedo tubes. The
woodwork should be reduced to a mini

CLEVER MEN WILL BOX
AT THE RELIANCE CLUE
Excellent Card Arranged by Asso
*Y elation Across the Bay â Other
Contests.
Ring-goers will journey across the bay
to-night to take in the boxing exhibition
arranged by the Reliance Athletic Club.
The gymnasium of the club Is an ideal
one for holding contests of this kind.
Two thousand people can be easily ac
commodated. The manner in which the
club conducts its contests compares fa
vorably with the Olympic Club of this
city. The spectators are kept within
bounds. The president of the club al
ways admonishes the spectators not to
give way to boisterous conduct and his
request is never violated.
The card is a good one. Jack Capeliss.
the Reliance Club's best boxer, is to be
pitted against Frank McConnell of the
Keystone Athletic Club. The latter is a
pupil of Professor DeWitt Van Court. He
is not only clever, but possesses a knock
out punch. They will battle fifteen
rounds. "Spider" Welch, the lanky box>rr
who put away "Sharkey" Joe Fields the
night of the Jeffries-Ruhlin fiasco, is to
battle ten rounds with Tommy Gil
feather. Welch will find Gilfeather a
hard lad to beat, judging by the latter's
past record. The entertainment will open
with a four-round bout between Bobby
Johnson and Dick Cullen.
Gecrg^e Gardner and "Kid" Carter have
begun training for their coming twenty
round contest. The match will be brought
off before the San Francisco Athletic
Club on the 20th Inst. This will be their
third meeting. In former battles Gard
ner managed to get the decisions. Carter
claims he was not in good condition when
he last met Gardner. He will train as
faithfully for the coming fight as he did
for his contest with Walcott, whom he
defeated. As Gardner was beaten by the
"Barbadoes wonder." Carter's stock has
risen and the betting will be very heavy,
on the coming mill.
On Friday evening next the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club wil give its monthly
amateur exhibition. Manager Greggains
has arranged a fine card and thinks his
patrons will be pleased. The exhibition
was to have been given last Friday
night, but as it conflicted with the show
given by the Olympic Club, Greggains
postponed it a week.

SMUGGLER CATJGHT WHILE
LEAVING STEAMSHIP DORIC
Joseph Alexander Arrested With Ar
ticles on Person, and His Brother
Also Apprehended. \
Joseph Alexander and^ George Alexan
der, brothers, working as" longshoremen
on the steamer Doric, were arrested yes
terday by Lieutenant Edward Durkin and
Inspector Edward Peppin of the Customs
service for smuggling. The prisoners
have been for several months under sur
veillance of the Customs officials.
Customs Inspector J. B. Peppin' con
cealed himself in the forecastle of â¢ the
Doric on Saturday evening and overheard
Joseph Alexander In conversation with
the Chinese sailmak'er of the steamship.
The Inspector heard the Chinaman and
Joseph bargain for several silk caps, such
as are worn by engineers, which caps the
Chinaman took out of the folds of a sail
stowed away in his quarters. Alexander
was arrested as he was going off the
deck and two dozen caps were found con
cealed in his clothing.
The authorities are hesitating about
arresting the Chinaman, as he is not' en
titled to be landed and if arrested would
have a right to be released on bail and
this would cause complications under the
restriction act.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CATjIj, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1901.
SAILING VESSELS MAKE PORT
IN SPITE OF THE DENSE FOG
Bark Annie Johnson, Ship Wiscombe Park and Bark
entines Ruth and Tropic Bird Get In.
FLEET OF VESSELS MAKING PORT IN THE FOG. THE TROPIC BIRD ARRIVED FROM TAHITI, THE ANNIE
JOHNSON FROM THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS AND THE MILTIADES FROM AUSTRALIA. ALL THREE
SAILED INTO THE HARBOR.
THE fog did not stop the wind
jammers from making port yes
terday. The tugs would not go
out, but nevertheless the vessels
were bound to come in. Early in
the day the barkentine Tropic Bird
showed up off the heads, and as soon as
her numbers were made out the tugs
made a rush to secure the tow. Captain
Johnson had his vessel well inside the
heads before the Relief showed up, how
ever, and decided to sail in, finally mak
ing an anchorage off the Presidio.
If the tug Relief failed to get a tow from
the Tropic Bird she did manage to pick up
the ship Wiscombe Park, 101 days out
from Newcastle. Aus., via Valparaiso 51
days. The Wiscombe Park started away
from Australia with a cargo of coal, the
intention being to discharge at.one of the
South American ports and then load nitre
for England. Instead there came the
story of the shortage of the wheat crop
in Russia and the Argentine and the sur
plus in California, The consequence was
that the vessel was headed this way and
came from Valparaiso in ballast. Her
charter of 37s 6d will more than pay ex
penses and she will reach her home port
with a dividend for the pockets of her
owners.
Came In Through the Fog.
Among the vessels that followed the
Wiscombe Park into port were the bark
Annie Johnson, barkentine Ruth, ship Mil
tiades and the steamer Mineola. The An
nie Johnson was fifteen days coming from
Hilo and has made the record run of the
season. The Ruth was twenty days com
ing from Mahukona and had one hard
gale to fight out on the way up. The Mil
tiades was fifty-nine days coming from
the Antipodes and the captain reports fair
weather up to the time of reaching the
California coast. This vessel, the Wis
combe Park and the Tropic Bird, which
was off port with them, were all in the
gale that raged off the coast and while
none of them suffered severely, all were
more or less injured
The Tropic Bird was thrown on her
beam ends and for a few minutes captain
and crew thought she was going down.
She righted herself and like the stout craft
she is. rode out the gale. and came in
without a rope yarn being "carried away.
Captain Jackson is proud of his vessel and
is deservedly so. A stouter craft than the
Tropic Bird does not sail through the
Golden Gate.
On the Wiscombe Park there was an ac
cident during the same gale. On Novem
ber 29 there was an order to shorten sail
and the starboard watch was ordered
aloft.
August Tell was on the mainyard, mak
ing fast a clew line when the order came
and just at that moment a squall struck
the ship and Tell was blown from the
yard to" the deck. Falling, he struck the
rail and went overboard. The vessel 'was
hove to and a boat lowered, but it was
like looking for a needle in a bundle of
hay and the unfortunate sailor was never
heard from again.
Seas Rise About Tropic Bird.
Captain Jackson said of his trip:
We had a good run from Tahiti and made a
splendid run to the equator. We were only ten
days getting .there, but after that we had a
terrible time with lieht and baffling winds. We
ran our course up to November 26 and then
there came a terrific west southwest Bea that
made the vessel roll gunwale under. On No
vember 29 our barometer was away down. I
felt sure ! there had been an earthquake anl
feared for my family in Alameda. Then the
sea began to pile up and now I can't under
stand wherÂ« It came from. There was no wind
and the ship lay like a log for a time. All
of a sudden the seas came along: and for a
moment I thought we would roll some of the
masts out. I don't know whether you had any
disturbance ashore or not, but Friday night
we had one at sea that made itself felt.
Sierra's Sailing Postponed.
The sailing of the steamship Sierra,
â¢which was advertised for 10 a. m., De
cember 5, has been postponed twenty-four
hours on account of a delay in the arri
val of the English malls in New York.
She will now sail Friday, December 6, at
10 a. m.
Water Front Notes.
Uncle Sam's survey steamer Ranger did
not get to sea" yesterday. She Is manned
and coaled and ready to sail at a mo-.
ment's notice, but the Government does
not think it a safe proposition to send her
out in the fog.
The Nippon Mara from the Orient and
the Chile from South America are both
due this morning. The chances are that in
epite of the fog they will make their
docks in time.' i
The Occidental and Oriental Company's
Doric sails to-day for China, She will
take away a very large cargo, but not
many passengers. Among those who will
go away in the cabin will be Bishop Part
ridge and his bride.

FORMAL OPENING
OF EXPOSITION
Senator Depew Delivers
Oration in the Big
Auditorium.
President Roosevelt Sends
Greetings From the
White House.
CHARLESTON, S. C, Dec. 2.â The
South Carolina and West Indian Exposi
tion was formally opened to-day with
words of greeting from the President of
the United States.
An Imposing parade of military and
civic bodies escorted the guests of honor
to the exposition grounds, where they
took part in an appropriate programme
of exercises. All Charleston observed the
day as a holiday and the city was hand
somely decorated. The weather was
beautiful. After the parade the guests
assembled in the auditorium, where the
ceremonies took place. The invocation
was delivered by the venerable Charles
S. Vegder of the Huguenot Church, and
Captain F. W. Wagener, president of the
Exposition Company, and Governor M. B.
McSweeney, s'poke words of welcome.
Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, United
States Senator from New York, orator
of the day, was then introduced. At the
conclusion of the Senator's oration Presi
dent Wagener stepped to the wire con
necting the auditorium with the execu
tive mansion and sent greetings to Presi
dent Roosevelt. A few minutes later the
response was received.
A number of State days have been ar
ranged, the first being Utah. December
14 is the day assigned to that State.
The principal object of the exposition
is to give a true representation of
American progress and the possibilities
of the country, and particularly of the
Southern States. A commercial problem
at this -time confronts the South, and,
perhaps, the supreme purpose of the fair
is to solve it. The great advance in the
number of cotton mills constructed and
the output of finished products- has cre
ated a surplus of cotton goods. Of this
product China was at one time the larg
est consumer outside of the home mar
kets. The recent disturbance in that
country, however, has virtually paralyzed
the markets and the home surplus multi
plies. The exposition site occupies about
160 acres of land on the bank of the Ash
ley River. The architecture of the build
ings follows closely the styles which were
introduced at the Chicago World's Fair.
The number of great departmental
buildings Is eleven, cotton, hall of agri
culture and minerals, and forestry build
ings, and structures devoted to women,
art, negro, and machinery.
The cotton palace covers 50,000 square
feet of ground area.-
The United States Government, in spite
of the failure of Congress to make an ap
propriation, has a display here, the Ex
position Company having provided the
necessary accommodations for the Gov
ernment exhibit recently seen at Buffalo.
/The Court ot Palaces, around which
the main exposition buildings are
grouped, is 1200 feet in length and over
900 feet wide. This court contains 1,650,000
square feet, and one of its unique fea
tures is a sunken garden filled with
tropical plants grouped around an elec
tric fountain.
The woman's department is under the
direction of Mrs. Sarah Calhoun Simonds,
a grandniece of the great statesman,
John C. Calhoun.

SUPERVISORS
SOUND ALARM
Creation of State Com
mission Strongly
Opposed.
Would Nullify Local Author
ity to Fix Rates on
Utilities.
Supervisor Braunhart introduced a res
olution at yesterday's meeting of the
board having for its object the defeat of
the proposed constitutional amendment
whereby a State commission is sought to
he created with extraordinary powers.
These powers comprise the fixing of rates
to be charged by railroad, water, electric
light, power and express companies, and
to make regulations concerning the same.
The resolution, which was referred to the
Judiciary Committee, reads:
Whereas, The said State Commission is to
be in every respect, so far as relateb to all and
every ttae said rates and charges hereinbefore
mentioned, and all and every the matters and
things howsoever connected with performing
said service and furnishing and supplying- said
commodities, the successor under the consti
tution and laws of the State of the Boards of
Supervisors and city and county or city or
town Councils and other covernins bodies or
body of toe eeverai counties, cities and coun
ties, cities and towns of the State, with the
came vcwera, authorities and duties now es
tablished by the constitution and laws of the
estate, or hereafter to be established by the
Legislature, "excect where the latter may con
flict with this section"; and whereas, it Is also
clothed with power to exact a license from, ail
persons encased in any of the specified busi
nesses, or desiring to engage in them, and to
fix the amount of such license, which shall be
conclusively deemed jast and reasonable; and
A Pernicious Proposition.
"Whereas, this State Commission is to be com
posed or five members, the first set to be ap
pointed by the Governor for two, four, six,
eight and ten years, and afterward they are
to be elected at the general elections for terms
of ten years, their salaries to be JboOu per an
' num. with power to appoint as many attaches
as they eee nt; and wnereas, the amendment
prescribes tha.t said commission is to be the
successor and absorber of a large measure of
the local authority of every political subdi
vision of the State, it should be the duty of all
friends of local self-government to exert every
effort to secure tae defeat of this pernicious
proposition, framed in the interest of corporate
greed and aggrandizement. Now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, By the Board of Supervisors of the
city t>nd county of S<ui Francisco that it here
by pledges itself to do all within Its power to
â¢ compass the defeat of this insidious ana ob
noxious amendment, and be it further
Resolved, That the Mayor is tereby au
thorized and requested to appoint a commit
tee of five members of this board, whose duty
it shall be to communicate, consult and co
operate with all Boards of Supervisors. City
Councils and Town Trustees tarouuhout the
State, and take such further steps as may be
necessary to defeat said constitutional amend
ment number 2S.
Public Utilities and Improvements.
The City Attorney was asked for hi3
opinion as to the legral manner of sub
mitting propositions for the acquisition
of public utilities and improvements to a
vote of the people and to clear up certain
ambiguities in the charter on the sub
ject. The City Attorney was also asked
to pa&s on the sufficiency of declaratory
ordinances on the acquisition of water
works and a municipal street railroad, as
amended by the Judiciary and Utilities
Committee and whether the bills must be
published fourteen or nineteen days.
The petition of S. C. Mott and William
Kellner for permission to hold a series of
bull-fighting exhibitions was denied.
An ordinance was passed to print
changing the name of Primrose street to
Carmelita.
A resolution of intention to change the
grades on Polk street, between Chestnut
and Bay, was adopted. â¢
The resolutions passed out of respect to
the memory of the late Chief of Police
Sullivan were ordered engrossed.
The Printing Committee was authorized
to enter into a contract to photograph
the members of the board at a cost of
$75.
A resolution was adopted appointing an
advisory committee of five, consisting of
Dr. D. B. Todd. K. Welch and Charles
Milly and two members of the Merchants'
Association, to recommend sites other
than the Bay View Farm for the erec
tion of a pesthouse thereon.
Curtis introduced an ordinance fixing
the license tax on professional boxing ex
hibitions at $250 each. The bill, together
â¢with Reed'B measure fixinpr the license at
55000 per annum, was referred to the
Joint Committee on Judiciary and Police.
rEOSECTJTTNG ATTORNEY
SCORES ROBERT "WILSOU
Case of Ex-Policeman, Charged With
Murder of Maggie Hartwell,
Is Closed.
The trial of Robtrt G. â Wilson for the
murder of little Maggie Hartwell on the
evening of July 4 of this year, which has
been going on in Judge Dunn's court for
the last week, was closed yesterday, so
far as the taking of testimony and the
presenting of the case by the â¢ attorneys
for the defense and prosecution was con
cerned. The case will be submitted to th'e
Jury this morning.
Assistant District Attorney John T.
Greany. who has been prosecuting the ex
policeman on the murder charge, deliv
ered a Bcathins speech in presenting his
case to the jury. He told of the cruel
end of the 13-year-old girl. How an old
man, who, forgetful of the days of his
own youth, lost his temper and deliber
ately took the life of a happy little child
â whose only thought was of thÂ« Joy she
was having with her playmates.
Greany was followed by Robert Ferral
end Judge Bahrs, who defended Wilson.
Both - these lawyers reviewed the testi
mony given by the witnesses at the trial
fr.il Â«xied to show that the shooting, if
It haj been done by their client, was ac
c'cmtal. â¢ ' ;Â» ; â¢ -fi

Malt Breakfast Food Is the only cereal
food that children will use and relish from '
day to day. It has a delicious flavor and
does not pall on the taste as other grain
foods do.
Oatmeal and other forms of grain foods,
0-wlrg to the presence of Insoluble starch,
are Injurious to the stomach and diges-
tive organs of the little ones, and fre-
quently give rise to overheated blood and
dangerous skin eruptions.
Malt Breakfast Food Is easily digested
by the youngest children; it quiets the
stomach when Irritated and gives restful
Bleep. Malt Breakfast Food Is specially
reccmirended for the babies after wean-
Ing. It affords all the elements for solid
flesh forming, bone and 4 muscle building.
Thousands of mothers are . bringing up

BOARD PROPOSES
NEW PLAYGROUND
Supervisors Order Ap
praisement of South
side Block.
Fence at Foot of Twentieth
Street May Remain as
Safeguard.
As a preliminary to the proceeding of
submitting to the electors the proposition
of acquiring grounds suitable;for recrea
tion In the district south of Market street
and east of Twelfth street, a resolution
was adopted by. the Board of Supervisors
yesterday directing the Board of Public
Works to appraise the value of the lands
contained In the block bounded by Harri
son, Seventh, Bryant and South streets.
This site was recommended by the Park
Commission for the proposed playground.
Later in the meeting the Board of
Works filed its appraisement of the block,
on part of which tho Board of Educa
tion has established a playground. It is
divided into two portions by Gordon
street, the smaller being valued at $137,
840 for real estate and $&6,200 for improve
ments. The larger portion , is valued at
5361,580 and the value of the whole block
is placed at $585,620.
The Board of ~Works filed a report that
the best mode of making connection with
Bernal Heights is to extend Folsom street
southerly to Cortland avenue and con
struct thereon a cable road with transfer
privileges with existing electric roads near
the present southerly terminus of Fol
som street. In the communication, how
ever, is no estimate of the cost of the
work owing to lack of time. >*â 
Petitions were filed by the citizens and
taxpayers in the University Mound dis
trict requesting that a resolution allowing
certain fences to be maintained in that
district be rescinded. The petitioners
claim they were unable to reach their poll
ing places on election day and the Board
of Works In permitting the obstructions
to remain is causing Inconvenience.
The Market Street and Eureka Valley
Improvement Club petitioned for the
transfer of a school lot on Sixteenth street
between Park and Prosper streets.
Mary T. Gaff, administratrix of the
estate of Owen Riley, deceased, filed a
claim for $125 damages, alleged to have
been sustained by the loss of a horse.
Fence on Twentieth Street.
The Board of Public Works presented
the application of the Rlsdon Iron Works
to temporarily maintain a fence across the
extereme end of Twentieth street, between
Louisiana and Maryland. The board stat
ed that it had no jurisdiction in the prem
ises as the Supervisors have exclusive
authority to grant such permits.
Chief Heath of the Bureau of Streets re
ported that the petition If granted will
only close the traffic created by the Ris
don and Union Iron Works and none
whatever by the general public. Heath
recommended that the petition be granted
with the condition that a gate in the same
be kept open throughout the day. The
fence will serve to prevent accidents to
others than employes on account of the
switching of freight cars on the street.
A resolution was passed to print author
izing the payment of $601 35 out of the
urgent necessity fund 'to James D. Phe
lan, chairman of the Supervisors' com
mittee to call the Anti-Chinese Exclusion
Convention.
Theodore F. Payne and Warren Payne
petitioned that the report of the Board of
Works regarding obstructions on Third
street be taken from the file and duly
considered.
Oppose Extensions of Time.
The practice of granting extensions of
time to contractors on public work came
in for much . criticism.
The ordinance granting- the contractors
an extension of ninety days wherein to
complete the construction of a culvert in
Trocadero gulch was opposed by Reed,
who said it was the third extension asked
for. Reed held that the policy of grant
ing extensions on public contracts j is
wrong. He Baid that the contractors were
in the habit -of accepting contract after
contract without regard to what they al
ready had on hand. Chairman Curtis of
the Street Committee explained that the
Board of Works had recommended the
extension and the ordinance was passed
to print. .
An extension of time was also granted
to the contractors who are repaving Polk
street because. the work has been delayed
on account of the labor troubles.
Russell P. Dunn, who filed an offer to
sell to the city the Visltacion Water
Works, with certain other water works,
rights and franchises, petitioned that a
time be set for the consideration of the
proposition. The petition was referred to
the Utilities Committee.
The Mayor filed a recommendation that
a bookkeeper be appointed in the Bond
and Warrant ' Clerk's office, also that tho
Auditor be authorized to employ ten tem
porary clerks. Ordinances on the subject
were passed to print.

MANAGERS AIR
THEIR TROUBLES
A Restraining Order Is
Granted Randall by
the Court.
Walter H. Willett Forbidden
to Sell the Business of
â¢ Wakelee & Co.
â Wakelee & Co., represented by Charles
Randall, manager of the firm's wholesale
drug store, petitioned yesterday for a
restraining order to prevent Walter H.
â Willett' and Viola V. Willett, his wife,
from forcing the collection of a note for
$16,000 and from entering into legal pro
ceedings against Randall.
Randall claims that Willett advanced
the firm $16,000 on a note which would
not become due for five years, and that
his object in seeking an order restrain
ing him from collecting it now is to save
the firm, which has been in existence
here for upward of twenty years. He
alleges in his complaint that last August
while he was sick in bed Willett came to
his home, and by threats of legal pro
ceedings and by insinuating that he
\Randall) was guilty of embezzlement
prevailed upon him to sign a contract,
wherein he agreed to consent to the set
tlement of the debt in October of this
year.
At the time the loan was made, alleges
Randall, Willett was made assistant
manager of the firm at a salary of $200
per month, and an agreement was made
whereby Willett was to receive one-half
the dividends of the firm. Randall, who
was elected manager of the firm at the
same time, claims that he found it im
possible to get along with Willett owing
to the latter' s attempts to cause him an
n( Kandail alleges that the money which
Willett says he embezzled was drawn
from the firm with the consent of the
assistant manager, and that in drawing
it he did not violate any of the terms of
the contract made at the time Willett
advanced the $16,000.
Judge Dunne issued a restraining order,
made returnable before Judge deawell
December 16, preventing Willett from
preferring any charges against Randall
or disposing of the business pending the
trial of a suit for a permanent injunc
tion.

NEGRO RAIDS
PULLMAN CAR
Boards Overland Train
and Flourishes a
Revolver.
Frightens Passengers and
Then Jumps Off and
â  Disappears.
A big burly negro ran amuck on over
land train No. 9 early yesterday morn
ing shortly after the train pulled out of
Martinez. A colored porter reported to
Seregant Mahoney of the Harbor Police
Station on the arrival of the train in this
city that the engro rushed through the
cars at 6 o'clock this morning brandish
ing a big revolver, frightening passengers
and . crew.
â  The porter, when he saw the revolver,
ran down the aisle of the car, and tho
passengers drew into the corners of their
berths and anxiously waited until the
negro had passed out of the car. The,
conductor of the train notified the rail
road officials in this city when he arrived
and two railway company detectives wore
sent post haste to Martinez to try and
fathom tho mystery of the negro's wild
action.
Who the negro Is nobody knows. He
boarded the train at Martinez and
whtether his motive was to attempt rob
bery is not yet known. After he ' had
passed through several of the cars he
Jumped off the last platform, although
the train was going at a moderately fast
rate of speed.
One theory is that the negro was
sneaking through the cars intent on
avenging some real or fancied wrong he
might have had against some colored por
ter on the train. .
The railway officials decline absolutely
to discuss the matter. -.

KEEPING QUIET
Police and Judges Use
Drastic Measures to
That End.
Highbinders* Pistols Win
Be Retained as Evi
dence.
Some of the be#t "gun fighters" at
tached to the police force were detailed
last night in Chinatown to assist Ser
geant Conboy and his squad to preserva
peace. There were eleven police officers
in citizen's clothes detailed there, and
they wandered around waiting for tha
shooting that did not come.
Notwithstanding the apparent quietude,
the. police expected to hear of a breaking
out of the feud between the Hip Yinga
and the Ping Kong3. Efforts were madd
again yesterday by the Six Companies to
bring about peace, but the. members of
the Kwong, Jue. Lee and Quon families,
who are concerned in the feud, would not
come together. These families are the
most powerful in China, and they still
endeavor to maintain their aristocracy in
Chinatown. This makes the task of the
police and the Six Companies all the
more difficult.
Notices were posted in Chinatown an
nouncing the fact that Police Judges
were imposing extraordinary punishment
upon the captured highbinders. Cock
1 ou was sentenced yesterday by Judga
Fritz to six months in the County Jail for
carrying a pistol In a hat box. Yee You.
also arrested on a charge of carrying
concealed weapons, was held under 1500
bonds, and his case was continued. He
hails from Marysville. Another gun man.
Jue Nun. charged with the same offense.
â who asked for a continuance until Thurs
day, was held under J20iK) bonds.
Jue Nom, another Fresno highbinder,
also languishes in jail because his tone:
will not provide the cash necessary to
ball him out. The four men are well
known to the police of this city, and
were forced to emigrate some years ago.
There are a few more the police are
looking for, but so far they have man
aged to escape arrest.
In Ross. Spofford, Baker and Pish al
leys, along Dupont, Jackson and Clay
streets, and in Waverly place, many of
the leading clubs are closed. Storekeep
ers connected with the families concern
ed In the feud have put up their shut
ters until the trouble i3 settled.
Another move has been made by Chief
of Police Wittman. Instead of returning
the pistols taken from the highbinders,
he has instructed his property clerk not
to return the pistols taken from them
when arrested. "Let them sue for them."
says the ,Chief , "or buy new ones." - *

FOOD FACTS.
How to Properly Feed the Body.
Physicians nowadays realize how nec-
essary it is that the food contain the
right elements that the body requires to
rebuild itself and replace the loss that
occurs each day from activity and en-
ergy.
If one lifts an arm, that means the ex-
penditure of a small amount of energy,
and the burning up, so to speak, of cer-
tain deposits from the food. This means
a certain loss and this loss must be made
up each day from food. If the food
does not contain the things required, na-
ture hoists a flag cf distress; aches, ails,
sickness cf some sort sets in, meaning
that there is something lacking in the
food.
The reason physicians so generally ad-
vise the use of Grape-Nuts Breakfast
Food is that they know from what it is
made and what it contains. The medi-
cal journals In various parts of the world
have given the analysis. The famous
"London Lancet" went bo far as to make
a very careful analysis by Its own chem-
ist. Its remarks are worth repeating:
"The preparatory process undoubtedly
converts the food constituents Into a
much more digestible condition than ln
the raw cereals. This is evident from
the remarkable solubility of the prepara-
tion, no less than one half of it being
soluble in water. The soluble portion
contains chiefly dextrin and no starch.
According to our analysis the following is
Moisture 6.02 per cent
Mineral matter -. 2.01 "
Fat lâ¬0 " "
Proteids 15.00 " "
Soluble. Carbohydrates 49.40 " â¢â¢
Unaltered Carbohydrates.... 25.97 " c/V
"The features worthy of r.ote In this
analysis are the excelent proportion of
proteids and mineral' matter, and solu-
ble carbohydrates.
"The mineral matter is rich phosphoric
acid. Our analysis shows that it is a
nutritive of high order, since it contains
the constituents of a complete food in
the right proportions and in an easily
assimilable state."
Notice the carbohydrate total Is about
75 per cent. These produce energy and
warmth. The phosphoric acid ln the
mineral matter comes, as do all of the
other ingredients, from the field grain,
not one particle being introduced as a
drug.
Physicians know that the Boft matter
ln the brain and nerve centers through-
out the body are made from the elements
of albumen acted upon by phosphate j of
potash. Albumen is a very common arti-
cle in almost every food, but phosphate
of potash does not exist ln all foods, nor
is it found in easily digestible form al-
ways. However, in Grape-Nuts these ele-
ments exist and are presented to the body
In an easily digestible form, and explain
the reason why users feel the new spring
of life, the brain and nerve power in-
rrease. after they have been using Grape-
Nuts for a time. There Is . a reason for
it. The doctors know it, therefore they
prescribe Grape-Nuts. - : ," â
thrf wisdom and joy of children is "Le
I*ozze di Figaro," with its confident op
timism and gay, fresh laughter. Its
cloudless, serene skies are the gift of a
younger day than this, of a spirit un
touched by the overshadowing "Welt
senmerz" of the hour, but when they
lift over us we also are there, with Mo
zart, in a fragrant Arcadia and with his
mirthful philanderers for the best of
company.
The cast was the same 'as on the first
performance and a wonder as before.
Everybody was there, and as-little as we
should have liked missing one of the
singers, it seems probable that any of
them would have liked it still less, the
na P of missing an appearance in such
glorious company.- It- came near It,
though. Sembrich, after the first act, de
veloped a sudden hoarseness, but asking
the indulgence of the audienceâ through
the genial Mr. Hirschâ went on with the
part. After only a few notes a shade less
luminously clear than usual the singer re
gained her voice in all its glory and the
audience breathed again. Eames seems
in all but perfect form, and her "Dove
Sono' -was sung with even more ravish
ingly beautiful effect than before. The
Letter Duet" was sung by the twin
stars in a fashion to make one forget
heaven, with a perfection of lovely tone,
exquisite sympathy and gracious poetry
that could hardly be. paralleled bv anv
other .two singers out of the celestia'l
choir. They were good enough to repeat
It, in response to the overwhelming en
core. Both singers are cast immaculate
ly in their parts, Eames the regal, as the
lady of high degree, and Sembrich, the
coquettish, as the merry Susanne, . and
the flowers that are becoming a feature
of the performances were showered on
both alike.
Little Miss Scheff caroled again in her
iresh ana buoyant fashion as Cherubino,
ana though she sang not quite so well on
the whole as the first time, her "Voi che
Sapete" was a. clever and pleasing ef
fort. She is a naive little girl, receives
her bouquets with surprise and turns
them stem on to the audience as she puts
them down, a little hastily, before report
ing to the conductor that she is ready for
action again. Miss Scheff is a most
promising young artist, who has made
great strides since last season and who is
deservedly a great deal of a favorite
here.
In this opera without a tenor hero, De
Reszke has one of his beautiful oppor
tunities as Almavina and was in his most
sumptuous form yesterday afternoon. He
is always sufficient unto the role, and so
yesterday did just what he always doe?
everything that is needed. Campanari's
Figaro is another tp'.endcr of the cast
and he, also, was fit and fine as the valet.
Tavecchia added his valued effort as
Bartolo. Miss Bauermeister could not be
anything but Rood as Barberlna. Dufriche
pleased as Antonio, and thus ends the
records of another all-star performance.
ABTTETS SCORE TRIUMPHS.
Hearty Applause Is Given Singers
at Matinee and in Evening.
Calve has redeemed her # fame as a prima
donna and last night she showed that re
markable ability as an actress and singer
over whic*h two continents have gone into
raptures.
Yesterday was a remarkable day for the
present grand opera season. In the after
noon "Le Nozze di Figaro" was repeated
before an audience that was the biggest,
in point of numbers, that has ever gath
ered within the Grand Opera-house. In
the evening a double bill was given, con
sisting of "La Boheme" and "Cavalleria
Rusticana," with Calve in the role of San
tuzza in the latter opera. The evening
audience was far from being a large one.
But Calve, whose rendition of Carmen
was declared by many not to be above
the average, proved last night that she
is all that has been claimed for her. She
was in splendid voice and there was not
a moment when she was on the stage that
she was not acting. A more dramatic
Impersonation of the character of San
tuzza has probably never/ been witnessed
In America and Calve was the recipient
of six recalls while the curtain was up.
Many flowers were showered on- Grau's
artists yesterday. The crowd at the mat
inee was composed principally of women
and the theater presented a brilliant ap
pearance. Mme. Sembrich is the last of
the Grau singers to succumb to the cli
mate and an apology was made for her
yesterday from the stage, after the first
act of "Le Nozze di Figaro." The song
stress was reported to be suffering from
hoarseness, but had determined to go
through with the performance.
The reception given to Sembrich and
Eames was of the most hearty character
and bouquets by the dozen were thrown
on the stage. Eames presented Sembrich
with a floral horseshoe and in return was
kissed by her sister artist. Then Sem
brich hugged all the rest of the cast and
distributed some of the floral gifts she
had received. The stage "love feast"
was enjoyed by the audience immensely.
Needless to say that Fritzl Scheff, Cam
panari and De Reszke shared in the ova
tion.
"La Boheme," which preceded "Caval
leria Rusticana" last night, was heartily
applauded by the audience. Suzanne
Adams, Fritzl Scheff. De March!.-. Gill
bert and Scotti were In the cast and were
called before the curtain time and time
again.
The attraction of Ihe evening was Calve
in Leoncavallo's opura. The famous in
termezzo was artistically rendered by the
orchestra under Fionas direction, and the
leader was forced to bow his acknowl
edgments to the applause.
To-night. "Tristan und Isolde" will be
heard for the first time in this city, with
Reuss-Belce, Homer, Van Dyck, Bispham,
Reiss, Bars and De Reszke in the cast.

to be given. The season ends Thursday
night with Â¥Le Nozze di Figaro."
AT THE THEATERS.
"The Girl From Maxim's" Captivates
Audience at Columbia.
Just to say it a little slangily, like the
play itself, "The Girl From Maxim's"
â Maxeem's, if you pleaseâ "has hit the
town right." The announcement that the
farce produced at the Columbia last night
was from the pen of the brilliant George
Feydeau, author of "The Gay Paris
ians," was in itself a sufficient guaran
tee that there would not be a dull, line
in the production. The farce in the
hands of the exceedingly clever com
pany -came up to expectations, and ex
pectation was high. It is as funny as
the Parisians, the fun being Parisian, be
ginning with a married man waking up
with a sore head after a night with the
boys and finding a pretty and vivacious
girl in the bed that he had not occupied,
he having snored through the night un
der an upset lounge in an adjoining
room. Dr. Petypont, the aforesaid mar
ried man, is informed by his friend, Bru
marge, that he had mistaken his own
house for a hotel ana had conducted the
girl from Maxim's thither. The girl,
whose latest name is Praline, sticks to
the doctor like a leech or a wife, and in
order to get her out of the way he takes
her to General Petypont' s country villa,
where the general, naVing mistaken her
for the doctor's wife, introduces her -as
such.
Praline's high kicking is mistaken by
the ladies at the villa for the latest Pa
risian style of curtsying and in the sec
ond act there are tantalizing | half
glimpses of shapely limbs and â¢ fluffy,
rustling lingerie. The fun of the play
centers about everybody mistaking Pra
line for the doctor's wife and Mrs. Dr.
Petypont mistak >.fe her for the spouse of
the general.
Joseph Allen, the general, has a laugh
that is contagious, and everybody on the
other side of the footlights laughs with
him. Funnier than even his laugh is the
quaint way in which he bestows kicks
upon himself. W. H. Turner is the
married doctor to perfection and makes
the best of the bad scrape into which he
has got himself. The Duke, John H.
Armstrong, in love with 4 Praline, is a
comical character, and his make-up pro
vokes merriment. Florence Gerald is the
rangy Mme. Petypont and comes In* al
ways at the wrong moment, but just late
enough not to find out anything. Even
the subordinate characters are funny,
and there is quite a brilliant satire on
the harmless French pastime of dueling,
in which the seconds arrange all the pre
liminaries, utterly regardless of the
wishes or the feelings of the principals.
The farce must have been rigidly blue
penciled, for it is not at all naughty as
ono might expect. For instance, Praline
Jumps out of bed in a very natty costume
and with shoes and stockings on, as if
she, too, had been too tired to remove
them when she retired. .
Although the night outside was threat
ening, there was the usual Columbia
Theater audience, and the applause was
liberal, but not , more liberal than the
performance deserved.
California.
Judging from the laughter and general
hilarity that reigns at the California this
week Thall and Kennedy's "Stranger.in a
Strange Land" has made a '; decided '. hit.
The fun is of such an infectious order that
one must be dumb indeed to be able to
resist it. From first to last there, is not
a quiet moment in the entire piece. Un
usual interest is already being taken in
the California's following attraction,
Clyde Fitch's famous comedy, "The Cow
boy and The Lady," which will be seen
here for. the first time on Sunday night.
The thousands who saw the Neill Com
pany play Fitch's other big success, "Bar
bara Frietchie," will be more than anxi
ous to see "The Cowboy and The Lady."
The advance sale will open on Thursday.
Alcazar.
The romantic drama, "An Enemy to the
King," was the attraction at the Alcazar
Theater last night. It called for the full
strength of the company and was most
elaborately staged. There were some slips
owing to an apparent lack of rehearsal,
but these will disappear. The plot is
based upon the struggle of Julie de Va
rion with the life of her father hanging in
the balance on one side and that of her
lover on the other. She is induced by the
Governor of the province to betray to
him the hiding place of Ernanton de Lau
nay, a'Huguenot captain, on the promise
that the Governor would spare her fath
er's life. Before she starts on her mis
sion De Launay, who is unknown to her,
rescues her from the clutches of Henri
le Conte de Berquin and consents to pro
tect her on her. journey, during which
they, fall in love with each other and
when she learns his identity she is strick
en with remorse and tries to undo the
wrong committed in betraying him. All
ends happily for the lovers. M. L. Aisop
as De Launay was a gallant and brave
lover and received several curtain calls
after the close of the third act. Howard
Scott was dignified and crafty as Claude
de Chatre, the Governor, and Henry Shu
mer was effective as his secretary. Paul
Gerson as De Berquin was a capable
swashbuckler. Miss .Marion Convere
threw considerable spirit Into the part of
Julie de Varion and her interpretation of
it was consistent throughout. Miss Mar
garet Wycherly as Jeannette, her maid
was . excellent. ... ' ...
Central.
"The Streets of New York" was pre
sented to a well-filled house last night at
Belasco & Thall's Central Theater, and
the old melodrama seems to. have \ lost
none of- its former charms. Thundering
applause greeted each new act of daring
performed by the hero, and- the fire scene
brought the audience to its feet. Thu
characters were well sustained by the
members of the stock company, except
ing for a really weak interpretation of the
role of Lucy by Mabel Pennock. | Hallett
Thompson was a manly Badger, and
Stanley -Ross -a- 'well, conceived Gideon
Bloodgood. Three character bits special
ly worthy of. mention were the ones as
signed Margaret Marshall, James " Corrl
gan and Ernest Howell. " .. , , *.
Tivoli.
A | large and unusually enthusiastic
audience was present for the opening of
the. second week of "The Geisha" at the

is the same as that of* : last week, except

sing- at the Orpheum last night. The
management announced, however, that
she Would < positively be able to fill her
engagement to-night. The general pub
lic can, therefore, be certain that this
evening they will hear and see the cele
brated vocalist and dancer.
All the other numbers on the pro
gramme went with a swing and there was
the usual Orpheum crowd in attendance.
Goleman and his trained dogs made a
great hit, as djd also the Dumond Par
isian Minstrels, while the Andy Lewis
Company was almost compelled to repeat
the clever skit, "The Cocaine Fiend/'
Fischer's Concert-House.
A capital programme from beginning to
end was presented at Fischer's Concert
house last night and so great was the en
thusiasm when Mme. Charity Martin and
John Desmond sang the duet from "Robin
Hood" that, the singers were obliged to
repeat the number three times. The Ler
ner children introduced many bright sing
ing and dancing specialties in their
sketch, "Aunt Amanda's Visit." Blanche
Reynolds, trombone soloist, made her first
appearance in this city, scoring a decided
success, and Dunning and Grimm pre
sented a graceful and daring trapeze per

and equilibrist, and Oro, Bernard and

STR.0THER SPENCER'S LIFE
ENDS ON OPERATING TABLE
Is Found Dying From Heart Disease
in Cellar of Owl Drug
store.
Strother Spencer, a clerk in the Owl
drug store, died while lying on the op
erating table in the General Emergency
Hospital yesterday forenoon. Spencer,
who had been connected with the Owl
6. ore for the past eight years, went down
into the cellar yesterday, a place where
he had not been in the habit of visiting,
and when missed by the other attendants
in the store he was searched for and
found lying on the floor breathing heav
ily. Restoratives were administered, but
as they failed to rouse the sufferer to
consciousness he was rushed off to the
Emergency Hospital. Dr. Bunnell placed
him on the operating table for examina
tion, but before anything could be done
for him he expired. The Coroner was no
tified, but permitted the remains to be
moved to an undertaking establishment.
Heart trouble is supposed to be the cause
of death.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Nrju York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. Dec. 2.-^>ecided weakness de
veloped in the stock market to-day after some
early exhibition of strength, and the last prices
of tiie day show considerable net losses and
all of the earlier grains wired out. The prin
cipal factor in the early strength was the re
covery In Amalgamated Copper and the de
cided rebound In the price of raw copper in
London. The reaction was based on the gold
exports and apprehensions that the President's
message to be sent to Congress to-morrow
would take strong grounds against great com
binations of corporations, with unfavorable
effect upon the market values of their shares.
A flurry developed in the call money market,
which later in the day accentuated the weak
ness in the closing dealings in stocks Pro
fessional bear operators were active in the de
cline and followed vieorous manipulative tac
tics, but they met with little resistance to
tnejr efforts in the way of supporting orders
ana the market was apparently lett unpro
tected. The resultant uncovering of stop-loss
oroers dislodged some large amounts of stock
especially amont the industrials, the trans
continental railways and the Vanderbilts,
which have been lifted on persistent reports ot
deals end mergers. The violence of the re
covery in raw copper in London pointed to the
conclusion that taaturday's demoralized break
was due to speculative short selling or that
later information was changed from that
which nrompted the selling. The recovery in
Amalgamated Copper reached to 76%, but the
etocR slumped atain to 72%. helping to upset
the market. Louisville and Nashville, South
ern Railway preferred. Southern Pacific ani
fcugar were prominent features of the upward
movement and Long Island became strong and
active at an advance of 4%. The announce
ment of gold exports to the amount of $2 000 -
000 was the turning point of the market, al
though considerable resistance was offered to
the decline after the announcement was made
The outward movement of gold had been gen
erally expected and speculators for the advance
tried to belittle its importance. Their efforts
were pertly successful until the party of reac
tion was reinforced by the anxiety over the
effect of the President's message and possible
Congressional action on the subject of cord
liinarior.s and the flurry in . call money. The
earlier ease of the money market and the late
ness of the hour at which the rise in rates
occurred gave rise to the supposition that it
might be partly due to manipulation. There
was a large disbursement of dividends and in
terest durins the day, but the effect of such
disbursements is likely to be somewhat be
lated in the New York money market. There
v.as a drop in New York exchange at Chicago
to 48 tftnts discount, which indicated some re
neweo requirements for funds at that center.

Chicago Grain Market
CHICAGO. Dec. 2.â Wheat was easily the
leader over everything else on the floor and
ruled uniformly strong. The speculation was
the heaviest in weeks and of the kind" traders
have been longing and hoping for. Cables were
a trifle down, but were considered remarkably
firm, considering conditions here at the last
session. Northwest receipts showed a marked
falling off, though they were still heavy. The
*Â¥? n U 2$ Â°v on passage had decreased
2.840,000 bushels, but the strong bullish argu
ment was the fact that this was delivery day
ror December options and something under 500 -
000 bushels was all that was delivered. Added
to this was the continued report of bad weather
in the Southwest for the winter crop. This
aggregation of bullish arguments started prices
upward with a boom. Even the bearish report
of an increase of 3,484,000 bushels in the visible
supply had only a temporary depressing effect
December opened a shade lower to a shade
higher at 73@73%c, sold up to 74%c and closed
strong, lc up, at 74@74%c. May opened Â»4c

said it was inflammation of the lungs. On

ONE OF HÂ£B HUSBANDS
WANTS MAERIAGE ANNULLED
John Valentine Says Wife Was At
tached to Another Before She
Wedded Him.
OAKLAND, Dec. 2.â John Valentine,
claiming to have discovered that he Is
one of his wife's two husbands, filed a
suit to-day by asking that the bonds of
matrimony existing between him and Em
ma J. Valentine, alias Emma J. Dickey,
be dissolved. In his petition Valentine
declares he married Emma J. Dickey in
Lowell. Mass., on October 15, 1900, under
the misapprehension that she was heart
whole and fancy free. She never dis
abused him of his mistaken belief accord
ing to the complaint.
It was not until November 4. 1900, contin
ues Valentine, that he made the discovery
that his. wife had already been married
to a man named Edward J. Dickey, from
whom she is separated neither by divorce
nor death. The complaining husband
says that the first marriage was cele
brated on February 18. 1880.
"She" Makes a Big Hit
OAKLAND, Dec. 2.â "She" was pro
duced this evening at the Dewey Theater
and was received enthusiastically by a
large audience. Manager Stevens has
s--pared neither trouble nor expense in put
ting on this piece. The scenic effects fully
igBtify the apparent outlay of money and
the artistic effort and the company was
never seen to better advantage. To
night's performance was the best produc
tion of Rider Haggard's dramatized novel
ever seen on this coast.
Child Attacked by Dog.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 2.â Edith Scott. 6 years
old, and whose home is on Encinal ave
nue near Willow 6treet, was attacked by
a dog last night and bitten several times
before the animal was beaten off by a
pedestrian with a heavy cane.

The liability to disease is greatly

COWELL REFUSES
TO REDUCE FEE
Capitalist Says Acting as
Lucas' Guardian Is â  . ...
Business.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, December 2.
Henry Cowell,- the man who made a for
tune in lime and plaster on Drumm street
In San Francisco, was a witness in Judge
Ogden's court this morning whither he
had gone in response to a summons . to
tell about the management of the estate
of John W. Lucas, an incompetent, who
owns some interests in the Cowell corpo
ration. - .
When Cowell was asked how much he
thought his fee ought to be for acting in
the capacity of guardian for Lucas, he
said $500 was about right. Judgs Ogden
asked Mrs. Lucas, who was present, if the
amount was satisfactory to her. Evi
dently It wasn't, for while she agreed that
$500 was reasonable compensation, she
didn't want it paid until Cowell had set
tled with her husband for $500 back salary
she claimed was due him.
"It's a cold business proposition with
me," exclaimed Millipnaire Cowell when
askpd about this salary matter, and he
signified that he was in no mood to take
less for his services or call It square be
cause money was alleged to be owing, i
Judge Ogden told Mrs. Lucas that he
could not consider the matter of non-pay

Judge Smith looked solemn and said
"Mr. Bailiff, lock that door."
The look of pleasure. faded away from
the faces of those responsible for the des
ecration of the temple of justice. They
had all committed an offense against 'he
dignity of the court. The court had seen
them, had taken cognizance of the mis
demeanor, and had them air under arrest
There was a sigh of relief when tho
Judge Picked out one individual and or.
dered him into the prisoner's dock There
was another sigh when Judge Smith a 1$

the reoort of the Chief - of Police on the
pound scandal. A number of witnesses
were examined! Poundmaster H. p;
Swift dehied : charges.of fraud, and said If
he had used his "opportunities to their
limit he. could have increased the pig
claims by thousands instead of hundreds.
Ho said that on one occasion he picked
up a dead shark on the beach, for which
he made no charge' to the city. Council
man Wixson tried to champion the
Poundman, and severely censured the po
lice officers detailed to investigate the
mysterious increase in pig bounty claims
for allowing an overcharge .of four pigs
to pass the City Treasurer. '
The Council will come to a decision, at
its next meeting. One hundred and thir
ty-one dead pigs were picked up on Oak

THREE WITCHES
One of the Assassins Will
Appeal to Supreme
Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 2.â It is announced
that an appeal to the United States Su
preme Court will be taken in the case of
Solomon Hotema, the Choctaw Indian,
who has just been tried and. convicted in
the Federal court of the Northern District
of Texas of the crime of killing three al
leged witches near his home at Cold
Springs, Indian Territory. The particular
case in which he has just been convicted
Is that of murdering a woman, Vina Cole
man, one of the alleged witches. Hotema
is a remarkable man in many respects
He was educated at Roanoke, Va., and re
turning to his tribe in Indian Territory
be held important offices, discharging his
official duties In an able and conscien
tious manner. He afterward became a
â¢Presbyterian minister and was a power
in the community where he resided
In the spring of 1899 an epidemic of men
ingitis prevailed in the Cold . Springs
neighborhood. Many people died of the
disease, among them being the little
daughter of Hotema. An Indian witch
doctor lived at the place and when the
list of fatalities assumed alarming pro
portions a number of -people, including
Hotema, consulted with him as to the
cause of the scourge. The witch doctor
asserted that the victims of the disease
had been bewitched and he went so far
it is alleged, as to name those who were
guilty of the dark deeds. Hotema and
three companions upon receipt of this in
formation from the witch doctor started
on a murderous pilgrimage through the
little community. Before they could be
captured they had killed two women and
a man and- wounded a number of others
whom they had attempted to kill All
the victims were alleged to be witches
These murders and the circumstances
under which they were committed caused
a big stir throughout a. large portion of
the country and the outcome of the trial
of Hotema was watched with interest.
One of his companions in the murderous
pilgrimage died In jail and the other on*
is still in jail awaiting trial. e

ENGAGED YOUNG
COUPLE MISSING
Strange ' Disappearance
Puzzles People of
Bakersfleld.
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 2.â Belle Kline,
19 years old, and William Martin, who
has just reached his majority, have dis
appeared .from their homes in this city.
Up to a week ago Martin was In the em
ploy of the local telephone company as
a lineman and Miss Kline had been in
the employ of the same company as an
operator. They were engaged to be mar
ried and no objections were raised on the
part of the parents of either.
On the afternon of November 22 the
couple started out for a walk. Since that
time they have not been seen. They
were attired in their Vevery-day" -clothes
and nothing of value belonging to them
has been missed. The authorities, who
have been notified of their disappearance,
hint at an elopement, but the parents of
the young lady dp not agree to this the
ory. As grounds for their contradiction
they say that there was no reason for an
elopement, as the young pair had been
told that they were welcome . to ' marry
when and where they pleased. Further
than this, it is said Martin was not finan
cially In a position to marry, and because
of this would not have been able to pay
the expense which would ;be attached to
a runaway marriage.
The officers dp not fear for the safety
of the missing couple, but the parents of
the young woman say that this hopeful
view does not allay their anxiety. It is
known that they are of the opinion that
a tragedy has been committed, but how
or when is a perplexing addition to what
has already proved a mystery.
Descriptions of the missing couple have
been sent by Sheriff Borgwardt through
out the country and deputies have made
a thorough search of this and Kern City.
A statement which would tend to
strengthen the opinion that Miss Killne
and Martin have eloped was made to-day
by Charles P. Fox of this city, who but
recently returned from Los Angeles. He
says that Mrs. Fox noticed on the streets
of Los Angeles a few days ago a young
lady whom she supposed at the time was
Miss Klline. Not having heard of her
disappearance, however, no particular at
tention was paid to her and the incident
was forgotten until it was recalled to-day
by the publication of the story in this
city. \
BERLIN EDITORS

BERLIN, Dec. 2.â Trial. was begun to

members of the editorial staff of Vor

mary and barbarous treatment of the
Boxers during the Chinese expedition, es
pecially of shooting , twenty-two Boxers
at Yachiao.
General von Ketteler maintained' that
these twenty-two men were shot in. pur
suance of a sentence of court-martial for
the massacre of 200 Christians: .
Lieutenant Stolzenberger testified that
the inhabitants of this village were driven
together in the market place, where" two
Chinese Christians picked out Boxers
whom they accused of participating in
the massacre in auestion. .
An English missionary named â  Lawry

two converts and selected twenty-two -of
their. . number as surely being Boxers.

POLICE DOUBT
ROBBERY STORY
Edward Ezekiel Says He
Was ;< Held c Up" in
Nevada Block.
Admits That He Loses All
, Earnings Playing
Poker.
Edward Ezekiel, collector and bellboy
at the Union League Club, reported at
police headquarters yesterday afternoon
that, he had. been knocked down and rob
bed of between $140 and $150 in the Ne
vada block by an unknown man. He told
Captain Seymour that after leaving the
office of, Reuben Lloyd he went toward
the rear stairway, when he got a blow on
the left side of the face. He staggered
against the wall and got another blow on
the right side of the face. . " Â« '
The next thing he remembered he was
lying' on the floor. He was carried j into
an office, and it was then that he discov
ered that he had been robbed. He did
not see any one and he thought the per
son who hit him must have been hiding
by the rear stairway. The money was in
his .trousers pockets, and $5 that he had
in his coat pocket and a check in his Test
pocket were not taken. \ ,
Before going to the Nevada block he
said he went to the Sub-Treasury to col
lect, where he saw a man standing in the
doorway. He saw the same man after
ward when he went up In the elevator of
the -Safe 'Deposit building. The man wore
a blue coat and light Fedora hat. He
said he would- not know him if he saw
him again. Ezekiel showed a bruise on
his left cheek and two slight bruises on
his forehead as evidence of the blow he
received.
, He was closely questioned, and admit
ted that he spent most of his time play
ing poker in the Cafe Royal and the Bald
win Annex.' He led the people in the Cafe
Royal* to believe that he was a reporter
on the Examiner. He had lost all that he
had saved and earned for the past two
years while employed af the- Union
League Club playing poker and he waa
behind the game at the Cafe Royal. He
has a wife and child at 1003 Golden Gate
avenue, where be lives.
He had promised his wife that he would
not gamble, and she believed him. Ho
owed $100 personally and his wife owed
$50. His salary is $50 per month, but his
wife rented out rooms in their house and
he had borrowed money from her to gam
ble with. She provided for herself and
the baby from the money that came In
from the rents and boarded with her pa
rents, who charged her nothing.
Captain Seymour and the secretary of
the club, who heard his story, were doubt
ful about it, and the captain detailed De
tectives Wren and McMahon to make an
investigation. .
After a thorough investigation Detec
tives Wren .and McMahon reported last
night to Captain Seymour that they were
satisfied that Ezekiel was not robbed.
They believe that a wound above his eye
was inflicted by himself in order to make
it appear that he was the victim of a
robber.
Robert Craven, a dishwasher, reported
to the Harbor police yesterday that he
had been knocked down and robbed of
$1 75 on Mission-street wharf yesterday.
The matter is being Investigated by Cap
tain Dunleavy, although little credence la
placed in the story.
James Dooley and John Rolkey were ar
rested early yesterday morning by Po
liceman McCormlck and booked at the
City Prison on a charge of robbery. They
were accused of robbing John Harring
ton of 614 Howard street . of 80 cents and
a pocket knife near his home. They ap
peared before Judge Mogan yesterday,
and after being instructed and arraigned

CHILEANS OBJECT
TO ARBITRATION
Some Fiery Speeches in
â¢ the Pan- American
Congress.
CITY OF MEXICO, Dec. 2.â The session
of the Pan-American conference took an
unexpected turn to-day. The order of the
day- called for a discussion of the project
for a Pan-American bank and the ex
change of official publications, but at the
opening of the session Mr. Baez of Para
guay took the floor and made a speech
advocating a comprehensive scheme of
arbitration.
Delegate Baez said that the Monroe doc
trine protected the American nations
only from European aggression. What
was needed was another doctrine to pro
tect'them from aggression on the part of
one another. This desideratum had been
supplied | by the Diaz : doctrine, recently
enunciated by Senor Chavero at the ban
quet given* by. the Mexican delegation In
honor of their colleagues. The basis of
the -Diaz . doctrine, he said,, was peace,
but peace could be assured. only through
Justice, and Justice could be assured only
through arbitration. Therefore, said Mr.
Baez, itwas necessary to proclaim com
pulsory and universal arbitration as the
basis of the international law of the
Americans.
The Chilean delegates showed manifest
Indications of impatience during the
speech of Mr. Baez. At its conclusion Mr.
Matte of. Chile arose and said that he
thought it would be better for the con
ference to confine Itself to the order of
the day, instead of listening to mere
academical discussions.
Mr â  Bermejo ! of Argentine, when he
"arose to report on the project for the
â¢Pan-American bank, took exception to
Mr. Matte's remarks, saying that the sub
ject of arbitration was not academical,
but one that vitally concerned the future
peace of the American continent. He then
went on to show the expediency of the
Pan-American bank.
The Chilean delegate then offered an
amendment to the effect that interested
Governments give the proposed bank a
subsidy of $100,000 Bold per annum for five
years, -to start with, to be contributed
according to population by the several
countries. The project was referred back
to the committee with this amendment.
The project for ; the exchange of publi
cations was also referred back to the
committee j with an unimportant amend
ment. -.' 1 " * < ; â â . â  - â  .'
' The session was about to adjourn when
Walker Martinez of Chile sprang to his
feet and made a fiery speech denouncing
what he f called the premature introduc
tion'of the/subject of arbitration. He said
that, as the subject was still in commit
tee, it was manifestly improper to pre
cipitate a discussion thereof before the
committee had reported. â  .

MORE ABOUT MAX
KERSHOW'S WILL
McAllister Says. Kowal
sky Showed Him a
Document.
Gives His Reason for Refus
ing to Serve as Executor
of the Estate.
The trial of the Kershow will contc3t
case was resumed yesterday in Depart
ment 9 of the Superior Court. Alice
Kennedy, Kershow's nurse, was on the
witness stand all morning. She testified
that she never saw Morgan Smith do
any writing at Tortoni's, but that she
saw him frequently at the Maison Rlche
take a sheet of paper and do a little
"scribbling." On these occasions, said
the witness, he always remarked that' he
was writing to a friend.
Hhea Gettings was recalled by Attorney
Rix. She said she saw Kershow in,18U9,
but did not go to live with him until 1900.
She left him, she said, in February or
March of this year. ~
Hall McAllister, who was named as ex
ecutor in the disputed will, testified that
he saw Kershow only .twice before â¢ he
died, and then only for a few minutes.
McAllister said the first time he saw the
document purporting to be the last will
of Kershow was in the courtyard of the
Palace Hotel, when it was shown to him
by Attorney Kowalsky. McAllister also
said that the reason he resigned the office
of executor was because he was going to
leave the State.
Dr. Henry L. Wagner, who attended
Kershow In bis last illnesB, was placed
on the stand. Dr. Wagner said the first
time he met Kershow was in 1899. when
he was called to attend him for sickness
due to overindulgence in intoxicants. In
April, 1901, the month in which the al
leged will was written, the doctor stated
that he called upon Kershow thirty times
as a physician and made fully fifteen
friendly visits. He said also that he
never, saw any one In the rooms of the
collegian but the nurse and occasionally
John Roland, his office boy, whom he sent
to Kershow's rooms at the latter's re
quest.
The case was continued until this
morning at 11 o'clock.
URGES PASSAGE
OF TARIFF BILL
Chancellor Von Bulow
Opens the Debate in
the Reichstag.
BERLIN, Dec 2.â "This bill is the most
important that has been before the house
for a long time, but 'it does not imply
any deviation from the policy in regard
to treaties of commerce," said the Im
perial Chancellor, Count von Bulow, at
the opening of the debate on the tariff
bill in the Reichstag to-day. "On the
contrary the Federal Governments are
firmly resolved to pursue a policy with
commercial treaties in the future In the
interest of German industry, while, of
course, upholding the just rights of Ger
many."
The Chancellor then proceeded to say
that the bill had been carefully prepared
upon material furnished by experts in
the various branches of trade and indus
try.' On these branches the imperial
authorities had built up the present bill
and submitted it to the Bundesrath,
which practically agreed on the measure
as long ago as July. The bill took into
account all the Interests and wishes that
were especially deserving of considera
tion, and more particularly agriculture.
But it was also Intended to remedy de
fects that the existing tariff displayed in
respect to commerce and industry. The
Federal Governments were fully prepared
for heated conflicts, but he (the Imperial
Chancellor) â¢ was convinced that the new
tariff offered a basis affording good pro
tection to agriculture, industry and trade.
He hoped that in the ensuing discussions
a sense of confidence in the Government
would prevail.
Emperor Approves the Bill.
The Chancellor's remarks were greeted
with cheers. Continuing, the Chancellor
said:
The Emperor has approved the bill, which
is the result of several years' comprehensive,
careful labor; which Is the outcome of the
requirements of German economic - life, and
which is Intended, while giving, so far as pos
sible, equal consideration to all interests, to
meet, above all, the wishes for increased pro
tection manifested by the agriculturists, the
Justice of which, within the limits prescribed
by one regard for the commonweal, cannot be
disputed.
The measure also is intended to furnish a
better weapon for future commercial treaty
negotiations with other states.
The bill, therefore, is not a departure from
the policy of tariff treaties. â 
The statement caused exclamations
from the Leftists.
"Wait a moment," retorted Count von
Bulow, "and see which way the hare
runs next." After a short pause he con
tinued :
In any case the Federal Governments have
firmly resolved in the interests of German ex
port trade, to pursue this policy in the future
as In the past, and to decide, according to our
own judgment, upon the limits of what we
can grant without abandoning vital German
interests.
It is now the business of this exalted house
to examine the bill and pass it to law. Tha
Federal Governments are' conscious of the far
reaching Importance of the task before them,
so far as the economic life of the nation Is con
cerned, and of the unusual difficulties attend
ing the reorganization of our customs system.
I dwell especially on agriculture because
with the Federal Governments I am convinced
it is. in a particularly difficult position, while
industry and commerce during the last de
cade have shown much more favorable devel
opment.
Protection, for Agriculture.
In view of the high importance of agriculture
for the nation's power and sustenance it should
be afforded every measure of protection com
patible with the conditions of our general eco
nomic life. Germany is both an Industrial and
an agrarian state. We must have regard for
the millions of hands- employed in the factories
and in traffic on land and sea. It should be
the earnest endeavor of every responsible
statesman to Insure and facilitate our share
of the International exchange of goods and se
cure foreign treaties on acceptable conditions,
thus promoting the well being of the great
masses of the population.
"We shall have to conduct our debates and
attendant domestic conflicts, which certainly
will . not be lacking, before foreign ears. Let
us remember throughout the conflicts and party
differences that we are dealing In our own in
terests with the national egotism, which Is
our perfect right, and let us not forget that
we can only present a united and strong front
to other countries by demonstrating in the
speeches and resolutions the paramountcy of
the general welfare"and general idea.
The appearance of Dr. von Thielman,
Secretary of the Imperial Treasury, was
the signal for an uproar that was contin
ued throughout his address. He urged
forbearance upon the part of those who
were dissatisfied, pointed out the care
with , which the tariff measure had been
drawn up and assured the house that it
would facilitate negotiations with Rus
sia and other countries. He said that In
spite of higher duties on cereals the Gov
ernment hoped to come to an understand
ing with the United Statesv ". \- ,i-

SOUSA RECEIVES
VICTORIA MEDAL
"March King" Tells How
King Edward Sur
prised the Queen.
Great Secrecy Maintained in
Arrangements for Playing
" at Sandringham.
LONDON, Dec. 2.â Sousa brought to
London from Sandringham, where his
band played last night by royal com
mand before their Majesties and the
royal family,, the Royal Victoria medal,
with which King Edward presented the
bandmaster in appreciation of hl3 serv
ices to music. The Prince of Wales per
sonally affixed the decoration to Sousa's
breast. â¢ .In describing the visit Sousa said
to a- representative of the Associated
Press: . ?-' â 
â¢â¢It was among the most gratifying ex
periences of my life. The royal command
was received several days prior to tha
visit, but was kept a strict secret, thÂ«
King desiring to give the Queen a birth
day surprise. Considerable duplicity waa
necessary to complete the arrangements
without divulging our destination. We
took Alfred de Rothschild Into our confi
dence and gave out that we were going
to play at his country seat on Sunday.
It was only when we entrained that the
band was informed whither we were
bent. The King's motor-car took myself
and wife from the station. We marched
into the ballroom, at 10:30. Some twenty
persons were present, including the King
and Queen, the Princess and Prince oC
Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, the
Duchess of. Manchester and Lady- de-
Gray. We first played 'God Save the
King,' and then his Majesty sent word '
that he wanted 'The Star-spangled Ban
ner/ during, the playing of which they
all, including King Edward, stood up.
The programme consisted of 'Plantation
Songs and Dances,' The Washington
Post March,' 'The Stars and Stripes,' a
trombone solo by Arthur Pry or and the
Reese-Davies collection of American
hymns, including 'Nearer, My- God, to
Thee.' which seemed to deeply affect the
distinguished listeners.
"The King especially requested us to
play 'Hands Across the Sea,' and then
sent word that he wanted 'Â£1 Capitan.'
He then requested 'King Cotton' and
the 'Coon Band.' At the conclusion
the King again sent word to
play 'The Star-Spangled Banner* and
again all present stood up. The King
stepped forward, shook hands with me,
chatted with me in the most cordial man
ner and asked me to congratulate the
band on. its excellent technique. The
Queen came up, thanked me and, turning
to the King, told him how much she had
enjoyed her birthday surprise, especially
the hymn tunes, of which she requested
copies. The â  Prince of Wales joined in,
referred pleasantly to his trip and ex
pressed regret that he did not have time
to visit 'the United States. Then the King
handed me this medal, which the Prince
of Wales pinned on my breast.
"The Queen accorded me permission to
dedicate a march to her. It was nearly
1 o'clock when we drove off to the sta
tion. I have never played to a more ap
preciative audience, nor have I been more
kindly treated. The King looked to be
In excellent health. He certainly was In
the best of spirits. He had nothing but
kind words for America, and certamly
knows more than most people about
American music."
DESERTERS PLAN
THE MASSACRE
American Renegades Are
Held Responsible for
Samar Disasters.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.â According to
Manila newspapers, copies of which havÂ»
been received at the War Department, the
massacre of Company C, Ninth Infantry,
at Balangiga, Samar, was planned by de
serters from the American army. The
newspapers state that two such deserters
are known to have acted as spies two days
before the massacre.
It is said that when the First Infantry
was relieved by the Ninth on the island
of Samar, these deserters obtained somo
uniforms. which had got adrift during tha
transfer and thus equipped passed as
American regulars. -
. Deserters in Samar are becoming very
bold, it is stated, and it is not an infre
quent sight to find signs written in Eng
lish posted on treea and shrubbery. Invit
ing Americans to Join the Insurgents and
instructing them how to enlist.
It is also said to be a generally under
stood fact that deserters from the Ninth
Cavalry (colored) are responsible for all
the trouble the American troops have
been having In the Batangas Province. It
is said deserters from this regiment led
the fight near Lipa in July, In which Cap
tain Wilhelm and Lieutenant Ramsay,
Twenty-first Infantry, and Lieutenant
Lee of the Engineers, were killed.
General Smith, In Samar, and the Twen
tieth Infantry in Batangas are said to bÂ«

In its report the Grand Jury says that

were dismissed and a number "of cases
that were presented were not considered.
In all sixty-live complaints of various
kinds were* considered and disposed of.
'ltee report says:
Criticize Police Courts.
The department which has haU our severest
criticism is that of the Police Courts and the
prosecution of criminals. We repret that politi
cal conditions have been such as to stand in
the way of a prompt and efficient dispensation

delays are <>rove;bial. but the slowness of ac

e'jflicienoy of punishment in many cases have
n<_t ajijieared to t's excusable.
This jury has been appealed { to to take up
cr.*cs vhich properly belong to the Police
Ooiite on the ground that the parties were de
void of laith in these aer>artnients. Such de

"We have visited seventy -one school buildings,

No teacher should be called upon to teach a
mixed grade, if it can pofsibly be avoided, as
it inevitably detracts iroci the best results.
The General expression of the teachers seems
to be that there are too many studies for the
school hours and the larger the class the less
effective is their work. In no case should a
teacher be called upon to teÂ»:h more than fifty
paplls in a class, and the number should be
restricted to forty whenever possible.
The school buildings have J>ean so often con
demned in imblic and private that it seems a
pity to repeat the condemnation. Many of them
arv a disgrace to the city; a. continual tax upon,
p-cpil and teacher alike. In jnany cases the
Eir.itary arr-liances call for immediate atten
tion; the provisions for escape in case of fire
are also entirely inadequate.
The old style desks aEd seats should be done
away with and replaced by modern ones, and
in every case they should be adapted to the
sire of the pupil. We saw children carrying
empty soap and candle boxes into school in

their feet. Those who are not so provided must
be in continual torture.
The usual praise and suggestions as to

NEW SCHEDULE OF OIL RATES
MAKES PRODUCERS JUBILANT
Railroad Commissioners Decide Against Defendant
Corporations Upon the Rehearing.
THE "oil: ' people/' r for such 1 the
producers of the \ valley ' oil fields
have been ", called, have won ' an
other victory, over the combined
railroads, -fhe. Southern Pacific and
the Santa Fe. . In a decision signed, by
Railroad Commissioners Laum.eister and
Edson the rehearing of ' the case of Le
Blanc vs.. the Southern Pacific et al. was
finally concluded yesterday. A new
schedule of . rates . has been established
and these rates are even fairer to the
oil men than those established by the re
duction made by . the commission last
year. . â¦. . .
The rate as . originally established by
the Southern Pacific Company was 42
cents per barrel from Bakersfield to San
Francisco. Complatnt after -complaint
poured into the Kailroad Commission on
account of the exorbitant charge, and
when John Le Blanc filed his charges the
case came up for a hearing. After an
investigation, conducted by the railroad
attorneys on one side and Frank H.
Short, the representative of the -oil men
on the other, the commission -reduced the
rate from 42 rents per barrel to. 37.8 cents.
Then came the rehearing because the
Southern Pacific, this time reinforced by
the Santa Fe, claimed â¢ to have new-evi
dence. The new evidence was heard and
a. new' schedule resulted. The* old switch
ins rates on the spur track,- a bone of
contention, received the heaviest shock.
They were cut in two. As In the .former
decision, Laumeister and Edson voted for
reduction. Blackstock. demurred, though
he was in favor of - a slight reduction in
the switching rates. _< . -"..-. ... ., \. 'â 'â¢.-.
jfrew "Schedule of Kates.
The new schedule of rates is" embodied
In the decision, which is as follows: ;
On all -shipments .where .the-.- distance ifrom
the point of shipment to. the point of consign
ment is 100 milts or less, a maximum rate' of
seven and one-half* (7V4) cents, per 100 pounds
shall be charred: for all .shipments where the
distance from the point of shipment to' the
point of consignment is over 100 ' miles, and : less
than 200 miles, a maximum- rate, of .nine and

Short Is Satisfied.
; Frank H. Short was well satisfied over
the decision: In an interview yesterday
he' said: . ' ' "< '
'â  The reduction made; while not a radical one,
is acceptable to the . oil interest. The reduc
tion in the switching charge Is of great direct
benefit, and is not complicated by, any tech
nical or legal questions, "i
: It is unnecessary to say that I am highly
gratified under the circumstances. It is not
so-much the immediate "question Involved as
the confidence "of the- people In the efficiency
of; the fcourts and public tribunals. The people
are disposed to. draw too hasty and unwar
ranted conclusions. The rehearing:, for in
stance, 'while apparently adverse to the oil men,
nas resulted In positive good, j
: It is my sincere hope that the companies
Involved, will . acquiesce' in â¢ the decieion. It
certainly cannot- be -seriously claimed that the
order : operates unjustly to them. They have
transported oil In large quantities from- Los
Angeles to San Francisco over the Tehachapl
mountains for less than 52 cents per barrel,
and- they admit that.it is more dlffloult to
transport c It from Los Angeles to Bakersfleld.
than - from Bakersfleld to San Francisco. It
follows that they have" voluntarily transported
oil from Bakersfleld^ to San Francisco at' the
equivalent of twenty-six (26) cents per barrel.
To say. < therefore, that Ian enforced rate ol
thirty-seven (37) cents and a little over per
barrel is unjust or deprives them of profits
ia not debatable.
It is to be hoped that litigation â will not fol
low, because it' can only, result in bitterness
and loss to all Interested.
The Railroad Commission has been In exist
ence more than twenty-one years; it is cer
tainly entitled at some stage of its - existence
to exert some - rights and exercise some con
trol.-The-railroads ought to - understand their
own business, and my Judgment in such mat
ters may be worth nothing or nearly so, but
results, business and profits, not litigation,
ought to be sought and obtained.
;' We are prosperousâ that is everybody but the
oll'men,; and 'they "ought to be. We ought not
to fight. ' bicker and contend. We ought to be
willing; to give' and' receive,, and benefit and
advance, all industries and Interests. The de
velopment of oil has. proven of greater benefit
to.the: railroads than any other one event in
the State's history.. They ought, . I think,, and
I -hope '.will/ accept the proceeding in the spirit
in' which it has been prosecuted; only to obtain
without 'injustice to anybody: the best results
for all. '* We -greatly need a sense of Just con
trol in â California; any. pretense of actual hard
ship r or* loss ' under existing , conditions ' could
only be â ' technical; and as a general claim â  is
preposterous â¢ on its face, and - would be vigor
ously combated. We ought to co-operate â  and

and then have an end of it. I. have not sought
or attempted anything beyond what seemed

GETTING READY
FOR CAMPAIGN
Convention of the State
League Republi
can Clubs.
Thousands of Delegates to
Meet April Next in
> San Jose.
Alden Anderson, president of the State
League of Republican Clubs, is In tha
city. He will soon call for a meeting of
the â  executive committee of the league,
so that the date of holding the biennial
State convention at San Jose may be des
ignated in ample time to make arrange
ments for a great Republican demonstray
tion. At Los Angeles in 1900 San Jose was
chosen as the city in which the convention
of 1902 should assemble and the executive
committee was authorized to fix the time.
President Anderson has recently con
sulted with leading members of the com
mittee in San Francisco and elsewhere
and ascertained that some time early in
April would be acceptable to a majority
of the clubs. The main idea is to desig
nate some week when farmers and work
ers in other fields of industrial activity
may be able to leave their accustomed
places of toil to render. their country and
the party a -patriotic service. It is esti
mated that 3000 young and progressive
Californians of Republican faith will at
tend the convention and assist in the
opening of the State campaign of 1902. It
is essential also that the citizens of San
Jose shall have ample time to arrange
for proper reception of the delegates and
provide facilities for the important work
of the convention.
Great Event in Los Angeles.
The meeting at Los Angeles in 1900, when
Alden Anderson was chosen president in
recognition of his clear record and dis
tinguished services, was a great event in
Southern California and awakened inter
est in the Republican cause throughout
the State. The demonstration next April
in San Jose may surpass all previous rec
ords of attendance and enthusiasm. It
is expected that every Republican club
in California will be represented.
The constitution of the league forbids
the endorsement of any aspirant for of
fice, but the i convention may proclaim
principles and express its judgment on the
great issues' of the day. It may be re
corded as a fact that the convention will
express the sentiment of the people of
California on the vital question of Chinese
exclusion, and it goes without saying that
the gag law will not be invoked to sup
press free speech and neither will tele
grams from eminent Republican members
of Congress be garbled at the direction of
the chairman. The presiding officer of
the convention will not accept a pro
gramme or look to a yellow newspaper of
Democratic tendencies for advice and In
struction. It can be safely predicted, also,
that the convention will not appoint four
Democrats on a committee of five to im
press upon a Republican Congress and a
Republican President the necessity of re
enacting the exclusion law. - â¢
Flint Arrives From Mexico.
Thomas Flint Jr., President of the Call
.fornia Senate, and a well known aspirant
for the first place on the Republican
State ticket of 1902. arrived In the city
yesterday from Mexico. During a recent
sojourn in Southern California Mr. Flint
received many assurances of personal
friendship and promises of political sup
port from leading public men of the
south. . .---....
State Senator "William M. Cutter of
Yuba is In the city. He understands that
Judge Edward Sweeney of Shasta and
Judge John F. Ellison of Tehama are
candidates for the Supreme Bench. The
Senator fancies that the Republican State
Convention would make no mistake in
establishing an order of business which
would permit judicial nominations to be
made first.
There is talk among local politicians
that Tax Collector-elect E. J. Smith has
selected James Simpson for chief clerk in
the tax office. It is also gossip that John

urer. â  r.-T'-Â£Â«<*-! '. .
W. F. Herrin received another backset
yesterday when the Railroad Commission
refused to recede from its former decision
to reduce tolls on oil shipments. Herrin
hoped to pull down Edson or Laumelster
and thus obtain a reversal of the board's
former decision. It is now obvious to the
dullest of politicians that Herrin is a

Mrs. Kingsley Returns.
Mrs. Clara Kingsley,' for whom much
anxiety was felt by friends and relatives,
returned this morning on one of the early
boats. The lady fortunately missed' the
San Rafael and returned, staying with
friends in San Francisco over Sunday.
She was the last of the Sausalito people
on the sunken vessel to be accounted for.
The body of George T. Treadway, the
waiter who perished, has not yet been re
covered and his widow still remains in
San Francisco. It is now believed that
Treadway's body is held -by the wreck
age at the bottom of the bay. When' he
was helped to the upper deck and left in
the cabin he was able to walk, although
he limped, and those who deserted him
thought him' able to care for himself.

INVESTIGATE THE WRECK
Commuters Are Clamoring for Greater Pror
tection Against Collision. f
SO FAR no new names have been
added to the list of those known
to have been lost through the
sinking of the ferryboat San Ra-
fael on last Saturday night. One
Sacramento man has been reported as
missing arid his relatives fear, though
they do not know, that he was aboard the
San Rafael. William G. Crandall, George
T. Treadway and Cyrus A. Waller are the
only ones known to have been lost.
Rumors have been circulating freely of
many missing men and women, but all
have proved untrue. Men whose friends
were sur6 that they left on the ill-fated
boat caught earlier ones and dropped oft
the connecting trains at their various sta
tions. From many of these stations in
formation was flashed over the wire yes
terday of the safety of those whose anx
ious friends and relatives had in their fear
given them up as lost.
The first chapter of the wreck story has
closed. â  The next will open with the in
vestigation of the accident by the United
States Inspectors of Steam Vessels. Cap
tains McKenzle and Tribble cling fast to
their original stories about signals and
they will have the opportunity to explain
the first and the last of the accident In
regular proceedings. Until then the story
of the disaster itself will rest
Alexander Hall of Sacramento Is miss
ing. His relatives have tried unavall
ingly to locate him and they fear that he
was a passenger on the San Rafael the
nigrht she sank.
The wreck has stirred up the commut
ers on both sides of the bay. All are
clamorous for greater protection against
collision. Schemes there are a plenty to
prevent future disasters. * This Is a sub
ject which the railroad companies will
have to consider in the near future, if only
for their own protection.
On all the ferry-boat lines traffic has
fallen off since Saturday night, because of
the fear of accident in the fog.
MAY HAVE GONE DOWN
WITH THE SAN RAFAEL
Disappearance of Alexander Hall, a
Wealthy Farmer, giving Near
Sacramento.
Alexander Hall, a well known and
wealthy farmer living near Sacramento,
has been missing since Saturday, and It
Is now thought he went down with the
steamer San Rafael. Hall left Sacra
mento at 1 o'clock Saturday to visit his
friend Patrick Cassldy at San Rafael, and
he was to take the boat' for that place at
6:15 o'clock. His disappearance lends
color to the belief that he fell a victim to
the disaster which shocked the entire
State.
Alexander Hall was well known In this
city. His cousin, Robert Cassidy, a track
man, lives at 114 Lily avenue. Patrick
Cassidy, a brother of Robert, lives at San
Rafael, .where he conducts a draying busi
ness. It was to see the latter that Hall
made the trip from Sacramento to this
city Saturday, arriving just in time to
make the 6:15 boat for Sausalito.
Robert Hall, a son of the supposed vic
tim of the bay disaster, arrived here on
the hunt for his missing father yester
day. He was Joined during- â  the day by
Patrick Cassldy, and all of the emergency
hospitals were visited. No traces of the
missing man were discovered. The two
searchers went to San Rafael last night in
the hope of finding some clew as to his
whereabouts in that section, if indeed, he
Is still alive.
Robert Cassldy said last night:
I do not doubt that Hall went down with the
San Rafael. He was to take that boat on her
last trip, and the fact that he has not been
haard from since leavlnjr Sacramento con
vinces me that he was a passenger on the Ill
fated vessel. Had ho not been, he would cer
tainly have shown up and made - his where
abouts known to his family. He was always
very particular about acquainting his wife and
children of his movements while away from
home. He Intended to visit his wife, who Is
HI in a sanitarium at Hvermore. but he has
not been seen there since the bay accident.
This convinces us that he Is either dead or ly
ing somewhere in a condition which prevents
him from communicating with his wife or son.
Hall -was about BO years of age, over
six feet tall, and of slender build. He had
bright eyes, set deep in their sockets; his
face -was thin and complexion ruddy. He
wore a mustache and close-cropped hair,
tinged with gray. He was a man of
wealth, and well liked by all who knew
him. Every care is being taken to keep
the news of his disappearance a secret
from his sick. wife.
SAUSALITO RESUMES OLD

and Excitement Over Wreck
, ; Dies Out.
SAUSALITO, Dec. 2.â The sinking of
the" ferry-boat San â¢ Rafael still continues
to be' the' chief "topic of . conversation,
.but the strain of- uneasiness that
marked â  the passing of yesterday, when
all Ihe passengers had not been accounted
for, has entirely subsided. > The ferryboat
J. M. Donahue, of the San Francisco a\id
North Pacific line, was secured . to take
the place of the ill-fated vessel and com
menced regular trips early this morning
Captain McKenzie has assumed charge
of the Donahue and he will continue â  in
command until - the company can make
provision for a" new boat of Its own : The
captain was exhausted by. the excitement
of the last two days and the accompany
ing loss of sleep, so he turned the charee
of the boat over ; to First Mate . Johnson
at noon and went to his home to rest for
the remainder of the day.
F. D. Lindsay, who has charge of the
local telephone station, rendered remark-
able service with the aid of his assist
ant. Miss F. Wosser. during the rush for
conversation over the wires. An idea of
the amount of business transacted may
be realized when the records of the com
pany show that more than 500 out-of
town switches were made and nearly MXK)
local switches. The average of out-of
town switches is between twenty and
thirty in the same length of time.

Wreckers Give Their Opinions as to
the Location of the Ferry
â < boat.
TÂ£e wreckers were out looking for the
remains of. the San Rafael yesterday, but
none of them have any hopes of locating
her bones, let alone raising the vessel.
Diver Roach says she is somewhere near*
the City of Chester, while Captain White
law Is of thefppinion that she Is some
where in the Tlcinity of the place whera
the Rio sank. He said yesterday:
There was a strong: flood tide running at tha
time of the collision. The current would carry k
the steamer down toward Lime Point. Accord- â¬
Ing to the best Information she floated fcr *
twenty-flve minutes, and must, therefore, have
sunk on the edge of the fifteen-fathom bank.
If she escaped that and was carried further
to sea she is in forty fathoms of water and
not a thins win ever be recovered from her.
