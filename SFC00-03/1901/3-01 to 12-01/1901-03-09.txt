"Did you ever see this peal before?'
Â¦was Captain Seymour's first question.
This was the seal v5:ich he impressed
upon some of the documents that led to
his latest arrest.
All his personal belongings were brought
with him. These confisted of two small
valises, and the evidence upon which the
police expect to prove the charges laid
egainst him. Nearly three years' confine
ment in San Qutntln served to curb his
spirit, but not his cunning. On his re
turn trip he gave Detective Byram no
trouble, but declined to taiti of himself.
Cooper Is Silent.
It was "Hello. Harry." when he entered
Captain Seymour's office, where his com

ives and the detectives who knew some
thing of his career. To the salutations of
each he responded courteously, and thank
ed Detective Byram when he removed the
Iron that was first used on Hedgepeth, the

accorded a free hand to take - all eha

other power aggressive enough to step
In and annex Chinese, provinces under the

Upon the degrees of support- afforded
the movement by Germany and Japan de
pends the result of what is understood to
be the almost synchronous action of
Washington and London The whole affair
is guarded with the greatest secrecy, and
It was not apparently without motive that
a special dispatch was allowed to go from
London erroneously announcing that the
negotiations going on between Choate
and Lansdowne related to the Nicaragua
affair. .'â¢''Â¦
Count Lamsdorf's reply to^ Sir Charles
Scott Is considered quite unsatisfactory.
"If such excuses are accepted by the
powers." said a British official last even
ing, "there will be nothing to prevent the
Immediate partition of China, for with al
most exactly the samo verbiage any Eu
ropean power could iustlfy the occupation
of other provinces.",
Russia's Iteply Unsatisfactory.
What prompts the British Foreign Of
fice to take such an aiarmlst view of cir
cumstances usually looked upon as fatal
istic sequences Is the apprehension that
Russia, having held her own in spite of
the protest of the Ministers of the pow
ers to the Chinese Government and hav
ing put herself on record in the reply to
Sir Charles Scott as determined on at
least a temporary occupation of Man
churia, will refuse to back down. That
she must do so Lord Lansdowne considers
vital both for the future of China and for
the continued existence of the concert of
the powers.
Lord Lansdowne is using every effort to
bring tho powers Into line In order to
present to Russia such a menacing front
that, without any ambiguity regarding
temporary or other occupation, she may
give up all designs upon Manchuria.
The slcnlflcance of the present phase
can only be appreciated by those cogni
zant of the lethargic attitude of the
British Government hitherto regarding
Russian action In China. Within the last
few days all this has changed. What a
week or two ago was pronounced only in
line with Russia's usual policy Is now
termed "a grave and serious state of af
fairs."
Now Considered Very Grave.
Almost simultaneously, it is understood,
the United States Government instructed
the various Embassadors to take similar
steps:â '-'â¢"" "y'j\ ;;^'':. Â¦Â¦;*Â¦".* Â¦"â¢ "â¢Â¦-â¢â¢'- :'Â¦*
Tho' answer* of Secretary Hay has ap-*
parently not yet been received in London,
although the fact that almost concurrent
instructions were Issued from Washing
ton is taken' hero to bo a self guarantee
that Russia's action in Manchuria will
not be tolerated by the United States.
Japan is relied upon to take a line in har
mony with the United States and Great
Britain. Germany, in spite of the Anglo-
German compact, is regarded as rather
doubtful, owing to Emperor William's
friendship for the Czar. France, of
course, will side with her ally.
What Choate did was to receive from
Lord Lansdowne an Important message,
declaring that Great Britain was not sat
isfied with Russia's declaration regarding
Manchuria as delivered to Sir Charles
Stewart Scott. British Embassador at St.
Petersburg, by Count Lamsdorf, and ask
ing the United States If It was pro
pared to take joint action of such a de
cisive nature that Russia would have no
alterative but to recede from her position.
Asked to Take Joint Action.
The conference held Wednesday be
tween United States Embassador Choate
and Lord Lansdowne. the Foreign Secre
tary, had nothing to do with the Xlcara
guan canal. To quote from a British offi
cial, "the Nicaraguan canal controversy
Is a minor matter compared with the pres
ent situation."

dressed as Cecil Sherbrooke Beaumont
Howland, Earl of WargTave. One letter
from "Beresford. Gray & Seymour of Lon

death of his uncle and his succession to
the title and estates. Howland was ot *>n
ffaffinsr manners and handsome, and his
conversation indicated the educated and
traveled gentleman. He rarely ref erre 1
to his past life, but of. one occasion stated
he had spent three large fortunes.
A. H. Harrison, a brother of the dead,
man who came from New York to claim
the body, denied emphatically that hi.-*
brother was of noble birth, but was silent
as to the cause for tie difference in th*
names. He admitted that thÂ© deceased
had earned several fortunes and lost
them again In speculation. Arrangements
have been made by the brother for the
Interment of the remains in Calvary
Cemetery this afternoon. In the burial
permit the name la given ac "C. B. How.

certainty over the proper name. It 13
stated that the deceased was born in
Brooklyn, N. Y.. and that he was 34 year3
of age.

LONDON, March 9.-The Morning Post
and the Daily Express publish dispatches
from â¢ Copenhagen declaring that the ne
gotiations between Denmark and the
United States for the purchase by the
latter of the Danish West Indies have
been definitely broken off.
Of course, the Danish Government Is
aware that the Monroe doctrine is cher
ished by the Department of State and the
Danish Government is perfectly aware
of the disposition of the State Depart
ment to acquire the Danish West Indies
for the United. States. It knows also pre
cisely the amount of money which thÂ«
executive branch of the United Stated
Government is willing to pay for the
islands providing the assent of Congress
can be obtained. The obstacles which sell!
exist, therefore, are located entirely with
in Denmark, and when the Danish Cabi
net can succeed in securing the approval
of the Danish people to the alienation of
this territory and . is willing to accept
the price offered a treaty will be speedily
arranged for submission to Congress at its
next session.
It is said the United States has never
threatened Denmark or attempted In any
way to bring pressure to bear upon her
and the negotiations always have boon
conducted in the most amicable spirit on
both sides.
WASHINGTON, March 8.â An emphatic
denial is given at tho State Department
to the statement published in a London
newspaper to the effect that the Unlto-l
States Government has addressed a nota
"almost threatening In tone" to the Dan
ish Government declaring that it will not
permit a transfer of the Danish West In
dies to any foreign power.

Has Threatened That

DENMARK NEED
HAVE NO FEAR
The abolition of the duty affects cigars
and cigarettes as well as tobacco in leaf,
filler or cut, all of the various classes of
tobacco, raw and manufactured, having
heretofore been subject to various rates ot
duties. That on cigars has been $1 35 per
thousand; on cigarettes in boxes 90 cents
per thousand; cut tobacco, *3 75 per 100
kilos; leaf or filler tobacco, J6 35 per 1TW
kilos, except tliat harvested in the pro
vince of Santiago de Cuba and exported
through the customs-Vouses at Santiago,
Gibrara or Manzanlllo, which paid $2 20
per 100 kilos. All of these duties are abol
ished under the order of to-day.
It Is estimated by the War Department
officials that the abrogation of the tobacco
duties will cause a loss of revenue of
about $SOO,000 or $1,000,000 per year. But It
is said that this loss will be more than
offset by the encouragement given to the
planters in Cuba to increase their produc
tion. The extent of trade affected by the
order Is very large, the tobacco exports
amounting to about $20,000,000 a year. Of
this by far the larger part came to the
United States. The value of unmanufac
tured tobacco exported v.'Ithin the seven
months ended July 21 last was $5,202,000.
and of this the export to the United State*
amounted to $4,802,000. In the same period
the export cf Cuban cigars was largest
to Great Britain, the United States com
ing second. The total value of thÂ© cljrar
exports for tho seven months was $-J,
030.000. .
General Wood's approval of the aboli
tion of this export duty Is practically an
expression of his belief that the Cuban
revenues from other sources are sufficient
for the needs of the insular government.
The original Idea was that the tobacco tax
was necessary to fully meet the financial
requirements of the Government.
WASHINGTON, March 8.â The Presi
dent to-day Issued an, executive order
abolishing tho Cuban einort duty on to
bacco from April 1 next. This action waÂ«
taken on the earnest recommendation of
the Cuban Economic Commission, which
recently visited Washington, Indorsed by
General Wood. A previous order had
been issued fixing an export duty of 50 per
cent on Cuban tobacco from April 1. To
day's action removes the export duty en

Disappointment among American busi
ness men here with the limitations of th.?
Spooner amendment to the army bill Js
increasing as its provisions become better
known, it is considered to be especially
unfortunate in apparently prohibiting th<;
issuing of licenses for the cutting of tim
ber upon public lands. If this interpreta
tion proves correct it will be a bonanza
for the few owners of private timber lands
in these islands and the beginning o/
building activity In all towns will be con
siderably retarded.
An inquiry has been cabled to Wash
ington asking whether or not this pro
hibition on timber cutting is to be con
strued as Included in the amendment.
The Forestry Department of the Philip
pines hitherto has issued Hcepses for the
cutting of timber upon public lands for
one year.
The question of the sales and apportion
ments of land and ruining rights, although
importantly affecting the growth of busi
ness In the Philippines, can wait until- the
regular session of Congress, but lumber
Â«s in such great demand for building pur
poses that it would be considered most
unfortunate should the control of Its pro
duction be vested in those few men who
now own timber land.
Regret Js expressed here at the fact that
Congress does not intrust the timber,
mining and land questions to the dis
cretion of the representatives of the ad
ministration here.
Timber cutters paid the Government an
average of 5 cents per cubic foot for tim
ber cut on Government lands, of which
there are to-day about 7,000,000 acres avail
able for such cutting.

his lonpr speech against time, which

FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR THOMAS H. CARTER OF MON
TANA, WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT A COM
MISSIONER AT THE ST. LO.UI3 EXPOSITION.
Â¦the war in So-jth Africa h:yl brought to
UpM many faults, even in those portions
of tfce army system which were believed
to be best He complained of the scanty
and reiuctsnt supp-.irt tliat the Govern
ment's proposals for strengthening the
military arm had received In the House
of Commons. ...
Broderick then proceeded to divulge the
War Office proposals, which contemplate
thp ability to send abroad three army
corps with a division of cavalry, in all
120,003 mon. and at Cw same time to have
a sufficient force for home defenses.
The War Office proposals further con
template that the country be divided into
e:x districts, each tllririct representing an
army corps, and each corps commanded
by an officer who hu-i a command in time
cf war. The artillery was obviously in
tufflcient and the iie!d artillery must be
supplemented by heavier gun?. The army
must be provided with a much larger
body of mounted men and transport, and
the musketry drill needed improving.
Favors Voluntary Enlistment.
It was a question between the voluntary
&nd the compulsory systems. He adhered
to th* former, untU-r which 140,000 men
had offered themseJyit for the war. Com
pulsion would, he pa:d, be like applying
the spear to a wffllas horse and would be
disastrous. The Government could not
hope to got rid of European rntangle
nu-nts. It could not shut out the possi
bility of having to dispatch forces to de
ter.d the British jKjsstsislons abroad.
Droderick thvn enured into details con
cerning the propoftel reorganization of the
army. Ho said the object of the Govern
inent in dividing the country into six dis
tricts was to centralize the responsibility
and decentralize the administration.
Three army corps. io be composed of reg
ulars. would be stationed at AMershot. at
Pr-.Si.-liury and in Ireland. The other three
ari:\v corps, to include sixty battalions of
miiitia and volunteers, would be stationed
ct Colchester. York and Edinburgh.
The Government in addition proposed to
raire eiprht battalions for garrison duty
frÂ«">m ncn about to enter the reserve, to
establish a reserve militia and to raise a
force of S/000 yei^nanry, to be armed with
ehort rii'es and bayonets. The net aridi
tior. to the- army under this scheme would
t>f 11S..WI mon. at a cot.t of Â£2,000,000, an-i
Â«9Av additional trained volunteers.
More Co-operation Desired.
Rroderir k also said it was proposed that
officers hertaftor Fhoula be able to jir.'i
c;;re their uniforms at Government estab
lishmrms at tho coÂ«t price.
Dealing with War Ofllce reform Broder
ick insisted that there mupt be hearty co
operation between the commÂ«nder-in-chlef
and the Secretary fcr War. and he asked
that a committee be appointed to advise
in regard to needed changes. He Bald tile
emimates for the year, apart from the
war estimate*. amounteC to Â£ 29 ,6S5 .OCH.
ThÂ»* Government had already taken on ac
cour.t cf the war tho fui! sum it expected
to have to ask for. They were determined
to carry the war to a conclusion and hai
rot stinted the nenerals in any way.
Broderick proposes to arm the volunteer
and militia artillery with field and posi
t'.on guns cf modern pattern, to raise live
mere Indian battalions for garrison duty
ar<5 to transfer the priirrisonJnR and coal
ing stations to the admiralty. He will not
increase the pay of the soldiers, but will
r'rvote more time lo maneuvers and less
time to barrack square drills. Under the
r.Â«=w scheme the array for home defense
will consist of l'<5SM repulars, 100.000 re
serves. 150.000 militia, 23,000 yeomanry an-J
2S0.O0IJ volunteers.
Brodc-rick emphasized the determination
of the War Office that only officers proven
fit to command in war time should have
fcppointmenta. He said:
*'V,> intend to delegate to these com
manders a large amount of the
row exercised by the War Office. I be
liove this delegation of power is the oniy
means whereby we can redeem our mili
tary system. All the forces of good na
ture, all the forces cf prejudice, all the
pressure which can be exerted will be
exerted to induce us to appoint officers to
or.mTram's for which thoy arc unfit, but
ajrain^t whom no fault can be proved. I
will not rorac to the House to ask for
thrvo largo *- stirnates for nn efficient army
and then be rncde for the sake of peace
pr.d <ju:et to put these troops under the
command of inefficient ofllcers."
Country Glad of Eef orms.
Judging from the editorials this mor.i
!nR this country will view the reforms
with the greatest satisfaction. The gen
eral belief Is that they ;ire ho thorough
and far-reachir.g as to betray the hand of
I>crd Roberts. Some of the papers con
f-ider the changes hardly sweeping enough
end are disappointed that there is no in
crease in the pay of the soldiers. Most of
them, however, recopnize that, the diffi
culties of the exchequer had to be con
sidered. Â¦Â¦Â« ',--
Eroderick's speech, which lasted tw/>
and a half hours and kept the house in
terested throughout, is praised on a 1 .'
sides as n. model of what such a statement
rhot:lrt be. it contained numerous miner
details for increasing the efficiency and
comfort of the fT^es.
The remainder of the debate turned or.
the vote fcr horses, the only incident be
ine: th^ Government's refusal to say what
â¢ price it paid for animals. The Radicals
interpreted the refusal to mean that t'o<?
authorities had been grossly swindled.
The Daily Chronicle says It fears that
when v^ace Is restored Broderlck and
. TsirA Roberts will find hard work in their
laudable efforts to exclude inefficients an 1
10 check extravagance in the crack regi
ments, but in this connection It should
be mentioned that a certain number of
commissions have been reserved for dc
rerving: men cf the rank and file.

OMAHA, March 8.â Ernest J. TColter. a
prominent merchant of Srhuyler. Xebr..
who was arrested In that city by a United
States Marshal on th<i charge of attrmpt
irg to blackmail United States Senator
Kcarns of ITtah, was arrrti^neii before
Commissioner Anderson this aftrrnoon.
He waived the preliminary hearing ar.d
was held to answer before the Federal
Grand Jury under $2000 bonds.
The arrest of W'olter was the result of
prompt work by the postofflce Inspection
department, its agents having been at
work on the case but five daya. Thpro
were three iettera written in connection
with the attempted blackmail. The first
February 19, was addressed to the newly
elected Senator at Salt Lake. It marte a
demand for $3000 and went into consid
erable detail in direvtins how the money
should be sent. It was specified that it
must be In $20 bills and that Kearns must
get a bundle of books and magazines ami
put the money between the leaves. It
was threatened that if this was not done
the writer would take Kearns* life an<l
that they would go to eternity together.
The writer said he cared nothing about
life until he could have the money, anJ
he directed that the amount be sent to
Box 4S4. Schuyler. Xebr.
Two days later. February 21. the sumo
person wrote a letter to Mrs. Kearns de
manding $12,000 at onco, and another $120)
by August 1. A threat of kidnaping her
children, was made as a penalty for non
compliance, and the writer stated that he
was an "expert with dynamite and nltro
glycerln."
These letters were put into the pn?=Â«pg
sion of Inspector Sullivan of Denver, who
at oncn started for Schuyler, arriving
there Tuesday. He called at the pn*t
ofllce and inquired who had rented lock
box 4S1, and was tr>ld that it had been
rented by Ernest J. Wolter. the proprietor
of a leading retail establishment of that
city. The inspector also learned that tho
Postmaster at Rogers. Nehr., had re
ceived a letter signed J. B. Walker, ask
ing him If a lockbox could be rented with
a combination that could be opened
hurriedly. The writer stated that he was
! a traveling man and had occasion to re
ceive mail at Rogers and did not wish to
ask for it. "
Th<Â» inspector confronted Walter -with
this letter and he admitted having written
It, saying he had done so at th* request
of a traveling man named Walker, nbom
[ whereabouts was unknown, and Walter's
j arrest followed."
i Wolter refused to dlreuss the case f:ir
i ther than to say that he is not guilty aa
charged. "The case may look bad upon
its face." he said, "but I have no mis.-.iv
ings as to the outcome. ThÂ»re art- othpr
parties In this. That's all I care to say
at present."
Welter went to Schuyler from Salt L.iSo
three years ago and opened a lar.re <lry
gooda establishment, taking a prominent
part in the business affairs of the com
munity. Hitherto he had borne a roo<1
reputation, and the news" of hl3 ariest
was received with much surprise. While
in Utah he conducted stores in several
towa-4, and during his way at Sail L;!ke
became familiar with the reputed wealth
of Senator Kearns. He gave bond and
returned to Schuyler this evening.
WOLTER MUST
NOW EXPLAIN
The Nebraska Merchant,
Charged With Blackmail,
Is Held to Answer.
He Is Arraigned In Omaha and Is Or
dered to Tell His Story to
the Federal Grand
Governor Allen denlor*s the unfortunate
occurrences, especially the action of the
artillerymen. Corporal Hlscock has been
placed under arrest and is now in th'i
guardhouse. It is probable that he wl!l
be tried by court-martial.
Tho teachers who have been questioned
on the subject have made statements
agreeing: with those of Superintendent
Armstrong to the efTect that the girl was
not harmed. It is probable that four-flfth.V
of those who took pai t in the rioting dLl
not know why they were mobbing the
American?. The rioters mostly belonged
to the unemployed Workmen of the popu
lation.
In the meantime the city police had firol
about 100 shots, mostlv In the air. There
were no casualties. Several other Ameri
cans besides the treasury clerk were
stoned from roofs and balconies. At S
o'clock last night the city presented i*Â»
usual tranquil appearance. Up to the hour
of lillng this dispatch to-day there has
been no further demonstration.
Firing by the Police.
A treasury clerk, who was one of the
men who ejected the lioters from tho
Independencia, was attacked, stoned and
disarmed by the mob. The insular police,
who have no jurisdiction in the city ex
cept In rases of emergency and at the call
of the Mayor and Governor, were not
called upon until 6 o'clock. At that tlm*
the artillerymen previously referred to
took the Initiative without orders and dis
persed the gathering.
This excited the girl's mother and sensa
tional stories were circulated with the
result that when the school children were
dismissed a number of boys gathered to
gether and paraded the streets. Thoy
were joined by many loafers and full
grown men and It became necessary for
the pollce\to escort Superintendent Arm
strong 1 from the schoolhouse to his home.
The Superintendent and policemen were
stoned as they passed through the streets
and, as the crowtFyonstantly increased In
size, the Americans sought refuge In tho
Independencia building. A number of
persona from the crowd succeeded in en
tering the building, but were ejected by
employes and others.
By 5 o'clock affairs had assumed such
a threatening aspect that Governor Allen
ordered the Mayor to disperse the mob.
notifying him that he sheuld ask for Gov
ernment assistance if he was In need of
It. The Mayor, however, paid no ptten
tion to the Governor's notification, al
though the city police, were poworlesr,
not being in any way respected by the riot
ers, whom they did not attempt to dis
perse. At 5:30 p. m. the offices were closed
and Martin C. Brumbaugh, tho Commis
sioner of Education of Porto Rico, asked
for police protection of his office and
hotel. _v.; = : v
Causes of the Riot.
The excitement originated in a trivial
school incident Involving Superintendent
Armstrong and illustrating the excitable
nature of the Porto Ricans. The Superin

CONTAGION AND INFECTION.
La Grippe Is Infectious but Not Con-
CoxitecrioHS dlreases nr? communicated
froiÂ» one person to another: infectious
diseases are conveyed through the air.
'Smallpox Is Â¦ contagious disease; La
Orippe is infectious. When an epidemic of
the pTip is prevailing It Is in the air we
breathe, and no one Is safe.
The only s--af<=truard is to keep the sys-
tem In th*> highest possible condition of
health, nnd on the first appearance of a
cold in the head to usp some safe antisep-
tic like Stuart's Catarrh Tablets freely.
A tablet taken every hour or two for "a
couple of davs will be sufficient to break
up the attack.
La Grippe attacks the weakest part of
*.h<? syFtom; it may be the lungs, heart,
liver, stomach or kidneys, but wherever It
finally locates it almost invariably starts
\r!th cold in the head and throat, or. in
other words, the disease at the beginning
if ncutp cartarrh.
Tni? Is the reason Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets have been so successful In break-
ing Mp attacks of grip, the antiseptic
properties of the remedy destroy the
frerms before the whole system is thor-
oughly infected.
Dr. Anniston says: Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets, being free from* cocainÂ»Â» and
harmful drugs, should be freely used at
this time of year on the first appearance
of RTip Ermptoms. â
They check the excessive catarrhal
secretions, stop the faver and prevent
pneumonia.
They are composed of antiseptics and
may b# u?ed b>' little children as freely as
by a<5Â«Its and with great b*Â»n<?flt.
Dr. Lewiston says: My usual prescrip-
tion for the grin is Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
let! 1 , which can be found at all drugstore?.
Keep to the house for a day or two and
nÂ«*> the tablets freely, and I- have ne\-er

who has been particularly vigilant In en
forcing an ordinance relating to sidewalk
signs, had the table3 turned on him this
afternoon and for ten minutes he hustled
about to comply with tho ordinance and
save himself from arrest. During this
time a warrant drawn up and signed was
awaiting service in City Justice Richard

An ordinance provides that signs over
sidewalks must be crescent-shaped and
nine feet from the walk. A. E. White,
proprietor of a First-street restaurant,
was obliged to remove a sign by the po

KIdward's livery stable on San Fernando

of the ordinance. White saw a chance to
retaliate and at once went before Justice
Richardson and swore to a warrant Â¦ for
the Chiefs arrest.
The police were called in, but, trem

warrant on their Chief. Kldward was
communicated with and begged ten min

granted the request and the arrest of the
Chief and its accompanying perplexities

ENTER STANFORD'S FACULTY.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March 8.â
The university announces' the appoint
ments of Dr. Edward Playfair Anderson
as assistant professor of English philology
and M. M. Ramsey as assistant professor
of Spanish. Professor Anderson has been
for the past five years connected with the
Washburn School at San Jose. Professor
Ramsey is a well-known authority on
modern Spanish and the literature of the
Spanish-American countries. His appoint
ment Is the first step in the development
of the study of Spanish at the university.
The defense had not finished with the
witness when adjournment was taken for
the day.
Mansfield admitted that Desirello, while
confined In Jail, was allowed to eat with
the jailer and given other privileges not
enjoyed by prisoners. It developed that
Deslrello Is an Italian politician at Colma
and has considerable influence ln that lo
cality, and the defense Intimated that this
had saved him from prosecution. Mans
field admitted that Deslrello had been a
member of a Republican convention which
named Mansfield's opponent for Sheriff,
but while the deputy differed from his
chief In politics he was retained in office.
On cross-examination by Attorney Rich
ards for the defense, Mansfield admitted
that he had summoned the jurors to try
his deputy, Desirello. for murder, and that
most if not all of the members of the two
juries that disagreed were special venire
men. In the first trial he had summoned
A. J. Fromm, a saloon-keeper, who served
on the jury. This jury stood six to six for
acquittal and Fromm voted for acquittal.
After the jury, was discharged. Mansfield
walked with Fromm down to the latter^
saloon and there "treated" Fromm anu
the crowd. A partner of Fromm, M. Du
lack, served the drinks. On the second
jury Dulack served as a juryman and was
summoned by Mansfield. Along this line
Mansfield was willingly led by the defense.
Mansfield denied the substance of the
article in toto. He admitted that he and
Desirello had been friends for years.
Manslle'.d said he did not consider the
Sheriff's duties to be those of prosecutor,
and he had done no more than summon
the Jury. He had asked the editor to re
tract the charges, and O'Keefe refused.
He believed his reputation had been dam
aged to the extent of $10,000, and therefore
brought suit.
The suit is based on an article in which
Sheriff Mansfield and Judge Buck of the
Superior Court of San Mateo were ac
cused of lack of interest in the prosecu
tion of Frederick Desirello, a deputy of
the Sheriff, who shot and killed James
Johnson, a bov, at Colma ln March, 1S99.
These officials were charged with using
their influence to obtain Deslrello's ac
quittal. Two trials of Desirello resulted in
disagreements.

HIS TESTIMONY
Every man who is educated will work; lie
will see that honesty Is more than not taking
his neighbor's goods. Ills duty to make somo
return to the world will be recognized.
To see things as they are In their proper
relations Is In Itself an "education. Xo man
commits a crime who foresees the results o*
his acts. The -criminal sees only himself.
his environment. Man must be bigger than
anything that can happen to him, for man
is not a happening:. The law of gravitation
Is no curtailment of our liberties. Freedom
even academic freedomâ Is* to do only what
becomes a man. More than that no one should
a?k for.
To carry out this tremendous contract
will strain the facilities of the Southern.
Pacific transportation department. A
great many cars will be required. The
shipments are now in progress and long
sugar-laden trains are daily passing
through Los Angeles.
The reason for the scarcity of cars for
fruit shipping is explained as follows: The
Southern Pacific Company has entered
into a contract to haul over the Sunset
route the entire sugar crop of Hawaii.
About 100,000 tons of raw sugar will bo
brought to San Francisco, whence it will
be taken over* the long haul . by rail to
Galveston and Morgan City, thence sent
by the Morgan line of steamers to the
Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York
renneries.
LOS ANGELES. Marrb 8.â Complaints
continue to come In from all over South
ern California about the shortage of fruit
cars and the Inability of the railroad
companies to handle the big orange, crop.
Many of the large growers have already
lost heavily, and If something is not. done
soon tons of marketable oranges 'and lem
ofis will go to waste. The situation is de
clared to be unprecedented. Thousands of
dollars have been lost to the fruit grow
ers of Southern California, with more to
follow, even under the most favorable
circumstances. Unless a special effort is
made by the railroads great hardship is
certain to resuil to the orchardists.
Redlands shiipers are greatly alarmed
by tht luck of cars to take away the
packed navels stacked up in the packing
houses, it-adv to leavf for the East as
soon as the oars to take them away ar
rive. Several packing- houses have been
forced to close their doors, not because of
any scarcity of fruit, but simply because
they cannot get cars.
Corona and Riverside packing-houses
tell the same tale. Covina orange hand
lers cannot get cars. Fullerton men ftar
a large part of the crop, will be lost un
less something be done Immediately.
Much' of the packed crop is already unfit
for shipping Ebst and has been thrown
out. Indeed, many of the packers have
had their men at work unpacking oranges
that were ready for shipment, simply be
cause they might keep a little longer un

part: Â»
The university Is but a part of the world
and its purpose is to help the individual to

There was a lone silence a3 Belahaw
sat down. There had been no passion In
his voice, but as he proceeded with his
arraignment he became deadly in earnest
and his words thrilled with the sup
pressed excitement that held him. He
used no Invectives, but his charge was
clear and to the heart of the condition
of things at this Legislature. He ds
manded that the Governor stay within
the powers and province of the Execu
tive and leave legislation to those In
whose hands the constitution has placed
it. It was a bold and a dangerous thins
to do, but as those who afterward voted
against him enviously said. "Beishaw
doesn't have to live by politics."
Fellow-Senators Criticize.
Shortridge followed him, saying tho
Senator from Contra Coata had mistaken
the meaning of the motion.
Smith of Kern said nothing had hap
pened in this seslon which would cause
so much regret as the "intemperate
speech of the Senator from Contra
Costa."
Curtln regretted the "lack of good
Judgment," and Senators who have bills
in the Governor's hands, or bills going
there, stood up and thrust the Iron Into
the man they knew had expressed, tho
conviction of them all.
Cutter again declared that there was
no personality in the matter, and the dis
cussion drifted upon the merits of the
measure. The motion to rescind the
resolution was passed by a vote which
showed the Contra Costan's words had
not passed unheeded. The roll call was

February 20. providing for the appoint
ment of a committee to Investigate the
State prisons, accused the Governor of
putting upon him a personal slight and
Indulging In petty dealing. The resolu
tion to rescind was Introduced by Cutter
earlier in the day, and was taken up to
night. .
. Cutter opened the discussion by re
ferring; back to a bill of $14,000 Incurred
by a former committee to investigate
the prisons, and predicted a similar, if
not a larger, expense should the resolu
tion adopted on February 20 be allowed
to stand.
Beishaw followed him. He spoke first
of the need of such a committee and of
the willingness of the Senate to adopt a
resolution providing for Its appointment
only a few days ago. Then he said:
I consider this attemot taken, to rescind the
action taken as a personal slight needlessly put
upon myself and a direct slap at me, delivered
by the Governor of this State, and I do not
propose to take Â«uch a slap from any man. I
am my own master here. I take orders from no
one, and that is the reason this resolution Is
going to be put through.
I am of one branch of the government; the
executive of this State is of another; and If he
is to run all branches we have a poor form or
republican government. It would be much bet
ter If were a monarchical government. This
resolution Is Introduced because I would not
take orders from himâ because 1 am on the floor
o( this Senate when people high in the govern
ment of this State did not want me here.
Ordered by the Governor.
I know this motion emanates from the Gov
ernor because I have been told that he has or
dered it. Senators on this floor have come to
me and told me that they had to vote for It
because the Governor had ordered them to â and
I respect them for it. They did not try to
hide; they came out directly and told me why
they would have to vote as they will vote. I
presume they thought Beishaw would be on the
committee of Investigation, and they feared
that, as there was some trouble In the last
campaign In San Quentln precinct, they would
get the worst of It. But they need not have
feared. I hope I am man enough, not to feel
the spirit they would credit me with havinar. It
they have anything down there to. hide I do
rot know It, nor will I be a party to it; but I
would not be unfair. ..
If the Governor of this State were assailed
unjustly and without cause I would be the first
Senator upon this floor to get behind him and
uphold him. I am with him when he Is right;

MENTO, March 8.â Just before the ad

provisions of the San Francisco charter
was taken up and passed. Few in the
Senate knew what they were voting on,
and there was no notice of a motion to re

SACRAMENTO, March 8,-The Assem

bill on reconsideration of the vote by
which it was defeated last night. Ander

measure calculated to secure more capa

SACRAMENTO. March 8.â The resolu
tion providing for giving 12500 out of the
Assembly contingent fund for a monu
ment to Stephen M. White came up In the
Assembly on a report from the Commit
tee on Ways and Means. Johnson said he
should be compelled to vote against the
resolution, as he regarded it as absolutely
illegal. He would vote for a bill provid
ing for such a monument, but he did not
believe the Assembly had any more right
to give money for this purpose out of its
contingent fund than to put a Â¦ fence
around his house. A simplifying amend
ment was adopted and the resolution sent
to print.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March 8.â Senator Wolfe arose
to a Question of personal privilege this
afternoon and with an editorial In this
morning's Call for his inspiration and the
paper itself for a subject he spent a half
hour in making a w-ell sounding and im
passioned speech. It was vastly different
from the speech of a few days ago, In.
which he roasted the commercial oodles
of the city quite as warmly as he in
dorsed them to-day, and which called
forth The Call's editorial.
Wolfe paid the management of The Call
had always been against him, which will
become obvious from a glance at the back
tiles of the paper, and ne quoted a com
plimentary speech from Senator Smith or
Kern, made two years ago, and commend
ing him in a friendly way. The remarks
as quoted were somewhat different from
those made by the Senator from' Kern on
the same day that Woife made his own
injudicious tirade.
Wolfe declared that The Call had mis
taken his remarks, but in this he was
wror.g. The Call's editorial quoted him
correctly. He also said the time' had
passed when a man had to bend the knee
to a newspaper. It was not asserted that
it was to a newspaper that Wolfe bended
his knee. It was asserted, however, that
such good citizens as voted for the elec
tion of the notorious "Eddie" Wolfe to
the State Senate solely because he ob
tained through the bosses the nomination
of the Republican party have now an op
portunity to study the result of their ac
tion. It was asserted in effect that Wolfe
cringed to the bosses, spoke contemptu
ously of the commercial bodies of San
Francisco, and, in disregard of the senti
ment of his -constituents, sought to hold
up the Santa Fe. Wolfe did not explain
that The Call was against him because
he elected at the outset of his public
career to give his sympathy and support
to Doodling measures of legislation. Wolfe
evidently comprehends that the people of
San Francisco are now taking his true
measure. Having failed to stand up the
Santa Fe in the Senate, he is striving to
"square" himself with good citizens, who
placed faith in his professions of honesty.
Wolle called attention to the legislation
which had been placed In his hands and
said it spoke for the confidence in which
he was held by the commercial bodies.
His speech was not a bad effort, but it
called to mind the answer Senator Sims
made to Wolfe's liery speech against the
China Basin lease last Wednesday. Sen
ator Sims said it reminded him of the
words of the ancient poet; who said:
I love to hear It ripple;
I iove to hear It now.
I love to wind my mouth up
And then to hear It go.
WOLFFS VIRTUES EXPLOITED.
lin opposed it. They said it was the
entering wedge for full suffrage for
wemen. and those who favored the bill
said they hoped it was. Wyoming and
Kansas were held up by one side as proof
of the uselessness of the plan and by the
other as proof of its effectiveness. Out
side of that, there was nothing new In
the arguments. The amendment was lost
by the following roll call:

The Senate has begun to talk of ad
journment next Thursday night. Instead
of Saturday. March 16. the date set In the
concurrent resolution adopted this morn
ing. Smith of Kern, chairman of the Fi
nance Committee, said to-night that the
general appropriation bill, the county
government bill and the primary election
bill were the only important measures
now betore the Senate, and that these
could be finally disposed of In time for
adjournment Thursday night.
The primary election bill, however, has
been amended in the Assembly in the Im
portant feature of the test of party affili
ation, and this amendment may prove a
stumbling block in the Senate. The legis
lative apportionment bill, accounted by
Senator Smith is out of the way. has been
amended in the Assembly and will come
up for final passage to-morrow. The As
sembly amendments play havoc with some
of the pet apportionment hobbles of some
of the Senators, and there is apt to be
mere or less prolonged contest when the
bill goes back to the Senate for concur
rence. On the other hand, the Senate will
rrs^ke considerable change in items of the
general appropriation bill if it follows the
recommendations of its finance committee.
The Governor has been consulted in
these, however, and the Senate amend
ments will probably stand. An adjourn
ment on Thursday, however, is not prob
able.
Defeated by the Governor.
The Governor's hand was seen in the de
feat of James' Assembly constitutional
amendment No. 9. providing for a system
of Courts of Appeal. There is with the
amendment a bill providing for the elec
tion of Judges at the time the amendment
is voted upon, to take office if the amend
ment be adopted. There are other things
In the amendment itself which take from
the Governor the valued power of appoint
ing the first Judges, and so the edict went
forth that the amendment should bo
beaten, and it was beaten. There was no
discussion, but many of the insiders got
oft wrong and had to change from no to
aye. Simpson gave notice of a motion to
reconsider. The roll call was:
Ayesâ Ashe. Beishaw, Burnett, Caldwell. Cor
ktt. Currier, Curtin, Cutter. Davis. Flint,
Greenwell. I^ardner. Luohslnger, Lukens.
Muonter, Xutt, Knweil. Selvage, Elms and
Smith of Los Angelesâ 20.
Noesâ Bfttman, Byrnes. Hoey. Laird. Kelson.
Oneal. Plur.kett. Phortridge. Simpson. Smith
of KÂ«>rn Taylor. Tyrrell of San Francisco,
Welch and Wolfeâ 14.
Absentâ Devlin. Goad, T^eavitt, Maggard,
Pace and Tyrrell of Nevadaâ â¬.
It was also understood that the amend
ment was beaten the more easily because
the measure was a companion to one by
Davis, and Davis got through the China
Basin lease bill.
Woman's Suffrage Loses.
Under Aiellck's constitutional amend
mÂ« nt to extend the elective franchise to
women in school elections, the whole sub
ject of woman suffrage was opened out
for the Senators to discuss, and right
lustily they availed themselves of the op
portunity. Simpson, Davis, Smith of
Kern. Shortridge. Lardner and Selvage
spoke for It and Cutter. Lukens and Dev-

CAI.T, TIEADQVARTKRS. SACRA
MENTO. March 8.â Assemblyman I-airds
constitutional amendment TS was passed
by the Senate this mornir.R. The measure
is one of the m*t sweeping that has been
introduced and lias caused much comment
and discussion. It went through the Sen
ate with just a sufficient number of votes
to carry it.
The amendment provides a "State Com
mission": It does away with the Railroad
Commission, the Bank Commission and
the Insurance Commission, and will exer
cife many of the powers now held by
Boards of Supervisors in the different
cour.ties. Its duties will be to fix rates on
telegraph n.nd telephone lines; gas. water
and electricity for light and power; to
control rai'.roal and eleepir.g car compa
nies' affairs; to supervise tanks and in
eurance matters and to control generally
all quasi public institutions and all public
utilities. For these purposes the jurisdic
tion of the commission Is not limitedâ it
can go into any city or county and regu
late as it pleases, for the Boards of Su
pervisors and governing bodies are re
lieved by the amendment of all the pow
ers it confers upon the State Commission.
The commission, as provided, will con
sist of five men, one to be elected every
two years, the State to be divided into
Commissioners' districts. Just as it is di
vided Into equalization districts. The
Commissioners are to hold office for ten
years, but the Governor is allowed to ap
point the first commission, one member to
rerve for two years, another for four, a
third for six, a fourth for eight and the
fifth for the full term of ten years. The
pay of each Commissioner is fixed at $60W
a year.
Taylor ar.d Curtln opposed the amend
ment and it had a hard time getting
through, but finally Currier, who had
voted no. was persuaded to change to aye
and make the twenty-seventh vote. The
roll call was as follows:
Ayrs â B^ttrr.an. I?urnett. Byrnes, Caldwell,
Coriett, Cutter, Davis, Devlin. Flint, Greenwrll,

Scant Courtesy to Senate.
The Assembly signalized its sixty-first
cay of the sessionâ the first day that has
carried) with it no pay â by a breach of
faith with the Senate and by a paucity of
results that made its services for the day
worth little more to the State than the
State laid it in salary â and that is noth
ing. The Assembly, by concurrent resolu
t'.nn, was to have devoted all of the morn
ing and aftcrnon to the Senate special file.
Instead it frittered away all but twenty
minutes of the morning session on mo
tff.r? to reconsider, reacing Senate mes
sages and oth^r work. In the afternoon
comparatively few Senate bills were put
on iinal passa^s. as contests over amend
ments and the second -eadinp of bills oc
cupied a larper part of the time, but on
m<-Uon of Knowland some restitution was
made by continuing the session till 5:30 p.
m.. when the S:le was completed.
Senate bill UCo. appropriating $100,000 for
a build'ng for the San Franciscc State
Normal School, was parsed by a vote oi 44

having met practically no opposition.
Oneal> Senate bill 473. by which the Gov
ernor's power of appointment during the
recess of the Legislature is defined and
the term of stich appointee is made to

sion, was passed by a vote of 45 to 11.
Cowan made a strong speech against the
bill, but Johnson said the measure was a
pood nv.p, and it went.

bfll by putting in a clause making the bl- i
appropriation of 1200,000 contingent
upon the application bv the Regents of o
I><-r cent of all the university revenue to
practical agricultural education. The
.â¢iirpndmPTit was defeated.
The "Rosier bill" was given its death
b'ow by the striking out of Its enacting
clause on motion of Johnson. Stewart of
San Diego and Duryca areued that the
"war claims" wore valid and some manner
of collecting them should be devised.
Johnson quoted from the Governor's veo
of a *rmiiar bill years ago and spoke in
opposition to the bill.

DUNN MATCHED WITH
LOCAL HAMDBxiLL MEN
The Twentieth Century Club hao all but
matched Terry McGovern and Davo Eur.l
van to f.jht here ln April. Within a fev;
daye articles of agreement will be sent to
these borers by Manager Glea:on of the
local club and both men will bo asked to
hasten their trip to this their future fle'.fl
of battle. These two little fellows havo
never .met ln the ring, but have had tv.-o
fights in public. There is no love between
them, and both are itching to set at one
another; at least such is the story. Dave
Sullivan has heretofore been prevented
from taking on the little Brooklyn terror
by his astute brother. "Spike" Sullivan.
The latter feared that Dave might be de
feated by UcGovern, and he wanted him
to hold off until he had sized up the situ
atlon. Dave was more hot-headed. He
was always eager to try his skill against
the champion and took every opportunity
to do so. On one occasion he and McGov
ern met in front of the Broadway Ath
letic Club. Their sneering looks and aide
remarks resulted in a street battle that
was only stopped by police interference.
Another time Dave Sullivan was danc
ing with a comely maid in a Coney Island
resort. McGovern and a party of friend?
entered, and when Terry saw his hated
rival he tried to stare him out of counte
nance. When the dance was over and
Dave had pallantly led his fair partner
to her seat he sidled up to McGovern and
wanted to know at whom he was staring.
McGovern soon pave out the desired in
formation, and when they were separated
there were some old clothes to sell. Sulli
van is the only big feather-weight now
before the public that McGovern has not %
scalped. Hegarty. the Australian cham
pion, will not arrive here until late in the
pame, but If he proves himself a worthy
opponent for the winner of the coming
battle he will be matched.
Cribb and Thurston are practically
matched by the National Athletic Club.
They will meet again in a twenty^round
"go" the latter part of this month in
"Woodward's Pavilion for 50 per cent of
the gate receipts. That the bout will be
an Interesting one is evidenced by the
splendid battle they put up two months
ago before the. same club. Ring-goers
have been anxious to see these two fel
lows meet again, ar.d it is certain they
will draw a large house. It will be re
membered that Crlbb and Thurston
fought twenty fierce rounds to a draw.
The "FlarMIng Dutchman." as Thurston
Is called, surprised every one by his
Fplendid showing against the seasoned
Australian pugilist. The bout v.-as fast
and furious from the opening to the clos
ing round. Thurston Is certain that he
can defeat Cribb. and the latter in as cer
tain that be can take the local man's
measure. Thurston' haS been training two
hours a day for the past three weeks to
prepare himself for his contest with the
Au*trs>11Â»n. Alec Gregp-ainÂ». hi' manager
and adviser, will take the Dutchman into
the country to give him a week's rest
nrlor to going into nctive training. Cribb
haÂ« been living at Rlanken's and Is doing
Hirht gymnasium work to keep his mus
cles In shape.

GUNMEN WILL
OPEN THE
SEASON.
The trap-shooting season practically
opens to-morrow. It is true that tho
Union Gun Club held a meeting last Sun
day, but it was purely preliminary to the
regular season. To-morrow the four big
clubs will inaugurate the season of 1901.
The best wing shots on the coast will
shatter bluerocks and pigeons at Ingle
side anoVat Alameda Point. All the cracks
have oiled their guns and laid in a stock
of shells ln preparation for the sport.
The California Wing Club will shoot live
birds sprung from their new set of under
ground traps at Ingleside. It was the In
tention to use them last Sunday, but the
club decided to open the ball to-morrow.
These new traps have been voted a suc
cess. The birds are placed into them from
underground and a dog Is stationed ln the
deep cleft behind the traps and retrieves'
with speed. This means a great saving
of time.'
The San Francisco Gun Club will shoot
bluerocks at Ingleside. It will be the
first club nhoot of the season and a large
number of members Is expected to be
present.
The Empire Gun Club will hold its open-
Ing shoot at Alameda Point to-morrow.
Bluerocks will be the target.
Quite a delegation of experts will Jour
ney East the latter part of next month to
participate in the grand American handi
cap, which will be held in New York from
April 1 to 6. inclusive. Clarence Nauman,
the local crack, will lead the vanguard.
Nauman is looked upon as being one of
the best trap-shooters In the West, and
his friends believe that he will make a
showlnur against the Eastern cracks.
Tod Sloan and Johnny Coleman shot at
Ingleside last Thursday afternoon In a
fifty-bird race. Sloan was defeated by the
bookmaker. Coleman secured forty-five
birds out of fifty, and Sloan could only
drop thirty-eight. A dinner was paid for
by the loser. , ,

YACHTSMEN TO ROLL
ROCKS INTO THE BAY
The Corinthian* will go over to their !
clubhoUM nt Tiburon in force to-morrow.
ThÂ« club bought an old buy penw which
was damaged in one of the winter storms
and hnÂ« uunk her a little off Bhore at the
wentorly ntda of the point. It is intended
to fill up the npnen between the scow and
tho nhore with rocktt and to uso the space
thus gained for the purpose of taking
npara, Balla nnd equipment of all kinds
from the yachts to the shore or putting
such things aboard the yachts. Hitherto
the float on the easterly Bide of the club
quarters has been used for these purposes
and has frequently been so cumbered with
material an to cause considerable incon
venience. The proposed extension of the
club premises will be very useful, espe
cially during tho period elapsing between
bridge-raising day and tho opening day of
the yachting season. Some of the owners
are going to have all they can do to get
their craft into commission for opening
day, especially as the bridge Is not to be
raised until the 24th. Things are so pros
perous along the citv front that few good
ship carpenters can be obtained aml'Roat
kecper John Norly will find It hard to get
all the help he wants. ,
George E. Billings' slooo Nixie and the
ark La Boheme are still on Swanson's
ways at Tiburon, but will soon come off.
At the .recent meeting of Corinthian
yacht owners the question was raised
whether Jack Short was an owner or not,
but was not pressed to a decision. Now,
however, it is understood that Short has
made an arrangement with Mr*. C. G.
Taylor for the yacht Emma, formerly
owned by the late C. G.. Taylor. The well
known large sloops -Embla and Sappho
wfll sail with the Corinthians this year,
as also will the little Pride. As the own
ers' meeting a "cabin yacht" was defined
as one having: substantial rabln accom
modations forming a part of the perma
nent structure of the craft. The defini
tion of a "Corinthian'.' yachtsman was
left to be decided at a later time.
The regatta committee will determine
whether the one-gun start Is to b#j adopted
in the races to be held this Reason or not.
An effort will be made during 1901 to
have the correct measurements of all
yachts entered on the club roll. A rule
has long existed to this effect, but has
been entirely disregarded. - .
It is said that Charles Chapman of the
Valiejo Yacht Club is desirous to send in
a challenge for the San Francisco Per
petual .Challenge Cud.: which was lost
last year by the Pan "Francisco representa
tive^ tbÂ« sloop Ondder. nailed bv Chap
man. The San Francisoos are also anx
ious to try to regain Â¦ the trophy which
they held for one year. â¢
The yawl Arcturns. owned by tV. 8.
Orover, is to be flold or chartered for the
season, her owner having o>dded not to
nut her into commission. The big sloop
Volunteer hÂ«s bÂ«Â«n bought by a syndicate

| Club, she hnn hitherto been an unpopular
craft from her owner's habit of cruising
.iÂ°i er the course while races were being
sailed. .. ... -
Jump lies between him and Cadogan.
Cooley '04 will get the high jump and
Wilcox '04 tho pole vault. In the weights
the freshmen, with Vilas and Ugda. will
win. The results of the one mile and two
mile runs are doubtful. Woods '04 and
Bailey '03 stand best chances in the
former, while, the latter will probably be
won by Clifford '03 or Stalder '04.
The varsity nine is keeping up strong

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March 8.-
Active track work >>Â»gan with Captain
Stewart's call fur caj dates last Monday,
and Stanford is assured of the strongest
point winning team that she has sent
a gainst the blue and gold since the spring
ct 1E97. Stanford will be strong In the
Jumps, eprinte, distances and pole vault,
and weak In the hurdles and weights.
Henley, the crack athlete from Uklah. is
conceded two firsts In the Jumps, and It
Is claimed that his work for the cardinal
will make a difference of twenty-five
points in the annual field day.
In the sprints Stanford has two stars In
McCaughern and Lamb. The former won
the hundred last year and took a place in
the 220-yard dash. The latter comes to
Stanford from Lon Angeles with some
fast records. Hamilton of Palo Alto, a
freshman, who was a crack in rhe
Academic League last year, Is looked to
as a possible point winner in the sprints.
These three men. together with Harter.
Nourse.and Stewart, will make a strong
representation for places in the short

either Lewis '04 or Zschokke '02. Richards

Naramore '03 and Rtrout '01 have entered
for the hurdles, with the chances in favor
of the two last named. Henlev in expect
ed to take first place In both the high and
broad jumps and a place in the pole vault.
Beach, Dole and Foster will enter these
events with him.
Stanford's woak^st point is the weights.
Brooke. Berwick. Slaker, Hyde nnd Clarke
are the only men who have shewn any

Since the first introduction of golf Into
California tournaments have never been
so numerous in this neighborhood as at
the present time. The famous profession
als, Willie Smith and David Bell, dis
played their skill at Oakland on March 1
and 2 and at the Presidio on March 5 and
6. giving flve exhibitions of golfing on all
four days. Though Bell took a higher
place than Smith In the United State3
open championship of 1900. being beaten
only by the famous Englishmen, Harry
Vardon and J. H. Taylor. Smith has
beaten Eell throughout almost the whole
of their California tour. Those who saw
Smith and Bell play at Oakland and San
Francisco were Inclined to think Bell the
more brilliant golfer, but somewhat care
less and erratic. Smith, on the other
hand, played an accurate, steady game,
driving, approaching and putting well and
getting out of the few difficulties into
which he fell with wonderful skill. ThÂ»
Oakland course, not having had so long
to dry out, and being of a heavy adobe
soil, with some low lying spots, was some
what heavy, though the putting greens
were In excellent condition. The fair
green on the Presidio course was never
In better condition and was favored by
the vlsltora. -
With regard to the comparative merits
of himself and Vardon, Smith stated that
he had met Vardon In flve matches and
hatl won two out of the five. He say3
that Vardon plays with machinellke reg
ularity, Is equally good In all depart
ments of the game and has an air of easy
confidence that is very disconcerting to
some opponents. It Is to be regretted that
the splendid golfing should have attracted
so few spectators and that the profes
sionals could not have tried their strength
against some of the best amateurs of this
city and neighborhood, but three of the
Tour days in which they were at Oakland
and the Presidio were ordinary week
days, so that Saturday, March 2, was the
only day on which there was even a mod
erate number of spectators. Â«
The tournament that was to have taken
place at Burlingarne on March 3 and 4
fell through entirely. Smith and Bell not
jming down to the San Mateo Club on
Sunday, and being informed that thetr
presence was not desired on Monday. The
reason for the professionals' absence on
Sunday was the fact that no prize money
was in sight, though there was an inten
tion to make up a purse by subscription
among golf-lovers of the Country Club.
However, golfers on a professional tour
do not care to exhibit their skill unless a
definite offer of prizes is made, and the
Country Club people should have made
up their minds Just how much they were
prepared to pay and have published a
prize list. If they did not care to pay for
their pleasure they should not have al
lowed two days to be set aside on the
golfers' programme for a vialt to Bur
lingame. especially as one of the days
was a Sunday.
Thl3 morning at 10 o'clock the second
half of the home-and-home tournament
between teams representing the San
Francisco and Oakland Golf clubs will be
played on the Presidio links. Last Satur
day at Oakland the city golfers were com
pletely snowed under, losing 44 up. To
day, however, the San Francisco team
will be much stronger, as it will Include
Mrs. R. Gilman Brown, Miss Alice C.
Hoffman. Miss Edith McBean. Miss M.
B. Houghton and Miss Alice Hager. Mlsa
Sarah Drum. Miss Florence Ives and Miss
Caro Crockett being the other three prob
able players. The Oakland team, will be
made up of Mrs. H. H. Sherwood, Mrs.
\V P. Johnson, Miss Bee Hooper, Mrs.
Le G. C. Tibbetts. Mrs. F. E. Magee. Miss
A. Knowles. Mrs. P. E. Bowles and Miss
M. Deane. Though It Is not to be expect
ed that the San Franciscans can save the
match, they will probably reduce the
heavy score against them.
This afternoon the opening match play
round of the fourth contest for the Coun
cil's cuprfor men will be held on the links
cf the San Francisco Golf Club, the eight
players who qualified being matched as
follows: Hugh Tevis vs. Charles Page.
W. H. La Boyteaux vs. H. C. Golcher, H.
C. Breeden vs. Captain D. J. Rum.ba.ugh
and S. L. Abbot Jr. vs. J. W. Byrne.
Last Saturday a team of six members
of the Sausalito Golf Club visited San Ra
fael, where they played an el eh teen-hole
match apralnst an equal number of thÂ»
home golfers. The San Rafael men won
easily, Dr. H. O. Howitt beating R. VT.

there will be a men's handicap over eight
een holes, match play, against bogey, thÂ»
two players making first and second low
est scores to rece-lve prizes of golf balls.
Play will begin at 2 o'clock.
Miss Healey recently won a nine-hols
ladles' handicap at Coronado, with a
gross and net score of 60. Mrs. Kautz

who will probably go are Drumxnond Mc-

power the Harbor Commissioners to set
apart a suitable site for the exclusive usÂ«
of rowlne clubs, incorporated under the
laws of the State of California for athletic
purposes only and not for profit and to
lease the same to the clubs for a period of
years. If the enlarr/jd powers abovÂ«
stated are given to tne Haroor Commis
sioners a petition will be prepared asking
them to set apart a location for the row-
Ing clubs. The Ariel Rowing Club is In
corporated and It will be quite easy to In
corporate the South End Rowing Club
also.

The bench show committee of. the San
Francisco Kennel Club held its regular
weekly meeting on Tuesday last, on whlcn
occasion many important preliminaries of
the show were settled. The secretary,
who has been authorized to select the lo
cation for the office of the club, will be
In a position shortly to report to the com
mittee with a few offers from the owners
of the necessary space. It Is a point in
favor of the show that the club will this
year have more trophies to offer the ex
hibitor than ever before. These trophies
will be of great value, and takinsr-this
circumstance in conjunction with the fact
that the judges will be two gentlemen of
the widest and best reputation as experts,
there is no reason why the entry this year
should not- surpass every, previous record.
A. B. Tr.uman of tho Elcho Kennels
promises to make such an exhibition of
pointers and Irish setters as has never
been seen on this coast before. E. C.
Plume, the secretary of the newly, orgaa
ized Cocker Spaniel Club, expects that his
club alone, exclusive of outs!de fanclsrs.
will bench not less than 110 dogs, wh'ch in
Itself Is 50 per. cent more than the total
number of the breed benched last year.
The secretaries of the other specialty
clubs are Just as enthusiastic, and it !s
stated that the bench show committee has
made arrangements with the contractors
to put up benches for not less than 600
dogs.

Bâ â RUTAL. Silurian. Telaaion and
Ada N" came together yesterday
at Tanforan for a four-cornered
race over the seven furlong
course. The crowd, which was
exceptionally good for a week-day, had
been worked up to an expectation of
something In the track line well worth
looking at. Disappointment was the po-
tion served, not that Brutal, the Burlin
game Stock Farm entry, won, nor that
Telamon, the favorite, was blanketed
with defeat, but that horses of such
known class could cover this distance in
such poor time. Â¦ It was an easy victory
for Brutal, and Ada X, supposed to be
the rank outsider, captured money which
burned the fingers of Telamon and Silu
rian, the first and second choices.
For a time down the back stretch the
fleet-footed four kept a line something
like well disciplined young seminary girls
in a march display at commencement
time. Then Ada N and Brutal grew
wearied at the slowness of the pace and
broke away from the staid monotony.
Silurian. O'Connor up. held the show
position, and favorite Telamon churned
the wake. And so they went their own
slow pace. Burns carried Brutal under
the wire a winner. Miller, on Ada SJ;
getting the place. Henry thought It wa_s
time to come in from the fields and he
sauntered home ahead of O'Connor, with
the leg on Silurian. The time was 1:2S%.
This race was by no means the surprise
solitaire. That game began at the out
set of the day when Mission, 7 to 1, with
Enos up, put to shame a field of ten in
the five and a half furlong race. Amel'a
Fonso was made a false favorite simply
because O'Connor was in the saddle. A
great deal was heard of Ulloa and some
thing of Dunboy. Both figured on the
tally sheet when the votes were counted.
Amelia was out in the snow trying to
rouse a sluggish circulation.
Greatland. with Charley Thorpe up, ad
ministered a .mild surprise in tho mile
race, the second on the card. It was
pretty much Greatland all the way. Im
perious, with O'Connor on top, giving tha
rest of the field no chance for the place.
In the third race O'Connor took Mac-
Laren over the five and a half furlonijs
ahead of the field, Valenclenne, the favor
ite, figuring not at all. Foul Play, very
long in the betting.lETot the place.
O'Connor's second winning came in the
fifth race, when he piloted Bonnie Lissak
safely to the bank. Moonbright. whj
made the place, was 20 to 1, and Maresa.
2 to 1. with Burns in the saddle, was the
favorite. One of those deep, finger-up
secrets buzzed on Sinfi, 19 to 1. Sinn cama
a neck or so of reaching the tail-end cf
the money. When the stretch was reached
SInfl fell In a pot of mucilage
Had Thornwild got away strongly the
last race on the card would have swelled

AT TANFORAN TRACK
BY LOUIS H0NIG.
WITH no attempt at exagger
ation, the racing at Oakland
track, clean and healthy as it
Is, has a firm hold on thÂ«
. pubile affection. Yesterday
the bright summer weather attracted
another large <rowd. there being an
especially liberal Eprlnkling of the fair
sex. Business In tho ring was enlivened
by the presence of several well known
plungers who had tired of the game else
where. Favorites again struck a winning
clip, romping away with four of the six
pvrses. Two long shots. Constable and
FJnaldo, gladdened the hearts of -the for
tune dreamers.
Passing over several pages to the dos
ing chapter, where a natty delegation of
rpeed had assembled, a very pretty race
was witnessed. The distance was over
tha Futurity course, and while Miss
Rowena. The Benedict and Good Hope
had loyal friends In the ring, their cause
was hopeless. At the start, Mounce took
The Light away in front, and made every
post a lamp post, beating The Benedict
four open lengths. Â« Even this did not
furnish sufficient illumination for "Pi"
Ruiz, who lost the show with Miss Row
ena to Good Hope. The mare's showing
was a very bad one. So fierce was the
betting on this event that the winner, con
sidered by many a rosy 4 to 5- chance,
opened at S to 5 and closed 6 to 2.
I Act Prince finally dropped into a spot
where he could get car tare, Billy Ca
hiil's colt met a field of trashy ones In the
first event at five furlongs, and ruling a
3 to 5 chance around post time won hand

Hughes and Elliott's bay horse Sir Rolla
had another try at the sport in the mile
and a sixteenth run. Shouldering 119
pounds, he gradually moved up from fifth
position, beating out- Barney F with lit
tle to spare. Even money was the clos
ing quotation about the winner. Jim Mc-
Cleevy finished' third.
No doubt a stumjÂ»le just before reach
ing the wire cost Maraschino ' the two
year-old purse. Johnny Humphrey's colt
occupied the place of honor in the betting,
and after cutting out all the running was
collared and downed a neck by Consta
ble, a 15 to 1 shot. Bassinger piloted the
last named youngster, Â¦which 'Is a member

Lento. Teddy Marks, owned by the
matchless dancer Paplnta, started, but
was unfortunate in getting away from
the post poorly. He is a fine looking son

Bullman scored an easy winning mount
on Rollick in the six and a half furlong
jaunt. The Burns & 1Vaterhou.se gelding
ruled an even money favorite and gal
loped home in front. Parsifal and An
drattus both tired after making the pace,
allowing Compass to come from far back,
securing place honors. There were only
four starters.
The lumbering Hagerdon was set up as
favorite for the six furlong dash, fifth to
be decided, only to be tumbled over.

place. \ : *<' :
It will be remembered that during, the recent inves
tigation by the Assembly committee into the relations
of the police with Chinese violators of the law one of
the Chinese witnesses swore that a large sum of
money was raised by the highbinders of Chinatown
for the purpose of getting Price remo\'ed because his
activity in suppressing vice in the Chinese district was
displeasing to them. That evidence, taken in connec
tion with the fact that the former Police Commission
had removed Price upon secret testimony and with
out giving him a hearing, was almost sensational in
its effect upon the public. It disclosed the existence
of a conspiracy supported by Chinese money to pro
cure the removal of a police officer solely because he
was faithful to his duty, and consequently it will be
even-where recognized that the Chief of Police
lias done right in restoring Price to the Chinatown
v/crk.
The conspirators who procured his removal in thÂ»
first instance will doubtless renew their intrigues
against him, and it is therefore the duty of the Com
missioners and the Chief of Police to give him a full
and resolcte support. If that be done we may see Â«t
speedy reform in the purlieus of Chinatown. Lieuten
ant Price cannot be ignorant that he has an oppor
tunity Xo make a brilliant record as a supporter of the
law. nor can it be doubted that he will do his best to
make the most of it.
LIEUTENANT PRICE has been- not only re
instated in his former rank in the police service
but has been intrusted with command of a squa<]
assigned to the duty of suppressing vice and maintain
ing the law in Chinatown. In appointing Price to that
duty the Chief of Police has done well. The act
completes the vindication of the wronged officer anil
restores him not only to his rank but to the very work
he was engaged upon when removed and disrated.
Having been assigned to that work the Commission
ers should now give Lieutenant Price full authority
to act and should cordially support him in all that he
undertakes for the enforcement of law. He should be
given as far as possible a free hand in order that he
may effectually disprove the charges of his secret ene
mies by showing himself exactly the right man for the

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
.Of all the speculations on the subject that which is
cf most interest to us is the suggestion that the new
star may be some huge burning and blazing mass
travelinjrin our direction from the far-off regions of
space. If such be the case the fiery wonder will yet
be a' menace and make things warm' for this planet, so
that Alaska will be the pleasantest place of residence
within the wide territories of the United States. For
tunately we need not be alarmed â¢ for the present.
Those who believe the star to be coming our wav
have made calculations of its speed and have arrived
at the conclusion that if it be journeying in our direc
tion it will not get as near to us as the sun in less
than 30.000 years.
â¢Finally, it is to be noted that this is not the first nor
Such figures are large, b.ut they are not the lar
gest that have been estimated. -Another astronomer
is quoted as having said: "What are we witnessing?
A phenomenon that occurred on the 22d of February,
1901? No. . We are perhaps looking upon that which
took place in the dawn of the history of man upon
earth. That which we see now is no more in /exist
ence; we are witnessing that which occurred in .the
long distant past. Is it the burning up of a world?
The spectroscope shows all such conflagrations, if
such it be, to be caused by the brilliant incandescence
of hydrogen gas. May it have been caused by the
falling. of a planet into a sun, or a star colliding
with a star in its course through the heavens? Science
reaches out to solve the mystery. Some day we will
know more about it."
One authority says the star is about six million
times as far from the earth as the sun, or "about 560
trillions of miles," and he estimates that the illumina
tion we now sec must have occurred in 1803. In
ether words,' it has taken this light something like
ninety-eight years to travel to our eyes. The same ex
pert adds that if the explosion which caused the light
also gave rise to sound loud enough to traverse the
distance to this globe it will be heard here somewhere
about 70,000,000 years from now, and will no doubt
greatly astonish the natives who happen to be here at
that time. â¢
With thÂ§ social aspect of the matter, however, we
have little concern and hardly any interest. The slight
est words of astronomers are worth more to the peo
ple of this coast than the enthusiastic babbling of forty
lovers on a subject of this kind. When we turn to
the talk of -the astronomers, however, we find them
engaged in a dispute in which they fling around jef
crences to a hundred years, more or less, as if time
were no object. Even worse do they treat space.
They put on or take off some billions of miles from
the estimates of one another as <f space were a mere
matter of speculation.
From the reports that come to us it seems the star
makes its appearance in the skies of our Eastern
States at a time propitious to popular entertainment.
Boston reports seeing it almost directly overhead at
sunset and high up in the northwest at 9 o'clock.
Those are hours well fitted for star-gazing, and even
Mrs. Grundy can hardly complain of young folks who
start on their strolls for astronomic study at early twi
light and get home before 10.
PROM a popular point of view the new star that
suddenly made its appearance on February 22
in the constellation Perseus has not been so great
z. success on this coast as in the East. It. has received
here a handsome but passing notice from the press,
and tHat has' been about all. In the East, however,
it appears to be a bigger attraction than anything at
the theaters, the Presidential inauguration or city
politics. Journalists write about it, society talks about
it, science studies it, and young men and maidens go
forth in the evening 10 gaze at it
THE NEW STAR.
Major Blakeney is of the opinion that any effort on
the part of Uncle Sam's soldiers to tell the truth
would be in the nature of a fatal operation. He is
probably also assured that some of the witnesses a;
the Rio investigation will never die from the cause he
suggests.
The statute fcas now been repealed, however, and
the burden has been taken off the backs of the people;
but notwithstanding it ought to be somebody's duty
to ascertain whether or not the express companies of
the United States owe any duty to the Government
the performance of which it can enforce. Laws are
passed to discipline the railroads, the trusts and other
interstate Corporations, but the powerful hands of
.Uncle Sam seem to be paralyzed when he attempts to
take from the express companies a small sum in taxes
to be used for the defense of the nation in a foreign
war.
This sum does not seem large when it is remem
bered that it has been taken from the people in the
shape of cent pieces, but the principle is sufficiently
important to merit further consideration. When Con
gress passed the war revenue act it intended that the
express corporations of the country should contribute
a small sum toward carrying on hostilities with Spain
and paying the expenses of the conquest of Porto
Rico and the Philippines. Not only have these organ
izations succeeded in defrauding the Government of
this money, but they have done so with insblence and
defiance.
Indeed, the action is something more than a con
fe'ssion of judgment. It is a confession that during the
past two years Wells, Fargo & Co. has been, through
technicalities and with the aid of its attorneys, rob*
bing its customers of large amounts of money daily.
At the beginning of the controversy over these war
taxes it was estimated that by refusing to stamp its
receipts and bills of ladingthis express company alone
took from its patrons in the neighborhood of $10,000
a month. Therefore successful evasion of the law has
netted the company in two years about $240,000.
Moreover, the fact that, according to statements of
the parties interested, the corporation has liquidated
the judgments in full and all the costs is a practical
confession that when it refused to pay its war taxes in
these cases it openly and flagrantly violated the law.
In short, notwithstanding the indignant denial of the
attorney for Wells, Fargo & Co., we consider the set
tlement of these suits a confession of judgment.
THE action of Wells, Fargo & Co. in settling the
suits brought against it in this city to compel
it to pay its war taxes indicates conclusively that
the corporation did not care to meet the issu-.
squarely. If it was not worth while to litigate the
matter the suits might have been compromised imme
diately after being instituted; but skillful attorneys
have been paid handsomely for carrying these actions
into the United States courts and back again, and for
devoting.a great deal of valuable time to obstructing
the wheels of justice in 'conjunction with them.
TRIUMPHANT TAX SHIRKING.
In the meantime the public may draw what consola
tion it can from the fact that the author of the lngle
side gambling ordinance has openly and publicly an
r.ounced himself as "responsible."
We shall have many such offenses to record while
lngleside is in operation as a place of legalized gam
bling. The menace of the curse affects every business
hou*e and every home in the city. No one can fore
see what cierk, what trusted emplcye, what public offi
cial, is going to be crazed into crime by losses at the
track: nor can any one tell what home will be next
raided by burglars, or upon whom the footpads of the
night will make their r.ext assault. The danger is over
the whole community, and until the crime has been
committed no one can even so much as guess what
will be its nature or who will be its victim.
It is to be noted th'jt legalized track gambling not
only corrupts the people of the community where it Is
tolerated, but it attracts to that community the vicious
and tht brutal from other localities. Toughs, black
guards and criminals ere drawn by racetrack gambling
as buzzards are attracted by carrion. Thus it is not
surprising that on the very day one broken track
srambler was arre;te3 for burglary it was learned that
a citizen troinp: to his home on a quiet street in the
citv was assaulted by masked footpads, who demanded
his money and fired at him when he fled from them.
ANOTHER TRACK VICTIM.
ONE more has been added to the lengthening list
of cases in the annals of crime caused by bet
ting at the racetracks, and the "responsibility"
of the author of the ordinance permitting gambling ar
lngleside has to that extent been increased. A young
man arrested on Thursday upon a charge ot burglary
has confessed himself guilty, and by way of explana
tion has stated that after squandering all his money at
the racetrack 'he became desperate and could find no
way to retrieve his fortunes except through the com
mission of crime.
Such offenses as this were very common in San
Francisco when lngleside was running in full blast in
past years, and they will be common again now that
the Supervisors have granted a renewed privilege pi
gambling. The author of the bill, who proudly de
clared himself responsible for it, is not going to find
his responsibility a sinecure. Gambling has a vitiat
ing cfTect upon the brain as well as the morals of men.
The broken gambler has left neither a conscience nor
a fair degree oi intelligence. He turns from the race
track to obtain money by any means possible. Some
times he commits forgery, sometimes larceny, some
times embezzlement, sometimes burglary and some
times murder. When none of those means of obtain
ing money for further gambling are open to him the
dazed .ind desnairir.2 wretch commits suicide.

They knew he would not do. their bidding and they
tried to defeat him. Fortunately for the city and the
State the voters of the Twenty-fifth Senatorial District
were not to be deceived. The event has proven that
they voted for the right man. The China Basin bill is
a measure of great importance to San Francisco, and
the defeat of the bill by the votes and the intrigues of
San Francisco representatives in the Senate would
have been in the nature of a public disaster. It would
have delayed for many years an improvement in our
transportation facilities which is of iiriperative
urgency. Therefore, in all our satisfaction at the pas
sage of the bill, we should not forget to give due credit
to the fidelity and efficiency of Senator John H. Nel
son.
The attitude of Senator Nelson in the contest is in
striking contrast to that of the notorious "Eddie"
Wolfe, who, by the grace of the bosses, misrepresents
the Twenty-first District. While Wolfe was doing the
work of the bosses in a coarse way and was
denouncing right and left all the advocates of the bill,
including in- his sweeping condemnation every com
mercial organization representing the business inter
ests of the people, Senator Nelson was working with
an equal zeal but with much better manners on th;
side of public interests. He represented the senti
ment of his constituents and was faithful to their wel
fare. Nothing that the opposition could do was able
to shake him in his firm resolve to be true to the peo
ple who had elected him to office.
WHILE the people of San Francisco and of the
State generally are congratulating one another
. upon the passage by the Senate of the China
Basin bill they should not fail to give due credit to
Senator John H. Nelson of the Twenty-fifth District,
who during the whole controversy stood firmly on
the side of the people and was largely instrumental in
obtaining the victory over the antagonists of the
measure. '.. .
SENATOR NELSON'S EXAMPLE.
IV.â TAKINa THE CENSUS.
The foundation of census-taking is geo
graphical. It consists of -the division of
the- territory to be canvassed Into dis
tricts of proper size, having regard both
to area and to population.- The number
of enumeration districts in the present
cenBUS was about 53,000, and the popula
tion enumerated was 76,304.799, so that the
average number in each district was ap
proximately 1500, although there were
great differences In detail, according to
the varying density or sparseness of pop
ulation. In general the boundaries of the
districts correspond, to' those of political
divisions, beginning with the States and
descending to those of townships or of
voting precincts, according to locality.
The determination of these boundaries in
advance necessitates a vast amount of ex
amination of maps and of statutes, to
gether with much official correspondence,
and is a troublesome undertaking. A de
scription of the district was pasted In
each portfolio for the enumerator's Infor
mation; also, wherever practicable, a map
showing at least its outline. This detail
was new and serviceable.. The only Inno
vation of importance In this branch of
the work was the reauirement that the
enumerator in a city should return the
population of each block' separately.
A more striking novelty was the use of
"street books," In which not only the pop
ulation but the dwellings and other build
ings, or even the vacant lots, were entered
in detail. This system served as a valua
ble check upon frauds in the enumera
tion, besides insuring a thorough canvass
of the district 1 and furnishing a record
which enabled a vigilant supervisor to
keep track of "Call backs," where houses
had to be revisited on account of the ab
sence of families on the occasion of the
first visit. Â¦'Â¦Â¦ , ,
In addition to the street books, in cer
tain large cities lists of the houses and
of the vacant lots, by street numbers, in
each enumeration district, were prepared
in advance for the enumerators' use by
the aid of the fire underwriters' maps.
These were In the nature of a notifica
tion of the character and amount of work
to be done by each* of them, and enabled
the supervisor to satisfy himself that no
occupied dwelling had been overlooked m
the house-to-house visitation.
Choosing a Date for the Enumeration
There Is no satisfactory date In the en
tire year at which to take the census. If
the date is too early the northernmost
portions of the country^are Inaccessible
on account of the continuance of the win
ter season. At a somewhat later date the
farmers In rural districts are busily en
gaged in the preparation of the ' ground
and planting. By Juno 1 many residents
of cities have left their homes for tha
summer and are temporarily absent.
There are objections to a date in the au
tumn also which need not here be men
tioned. . .
The fact that there are so many ab
sentees in cities at the time of enumera
tion i3 the occasion of much dissatisfac
tion and complaint. There is probably
not a growing town In the United States
of any size which does not cherish Illu
sion with reference to its population. In
many of them the exaggerated ideas en
tertained as to the actual number of In
habitants are based upon the more or less
fictitious estimates given Out by the pub
lishers of directories, who multiply the
number of names contained In each of
them by some assumed number. This
number is invariably- too large. But in
the twelfth census, , taken last year, an
attempt was made to Include absentees
in the enumeration as far as possible.
Elaborate arrangements were devised
with this end in view, including In cer
tain cities postal cards left at each house
in advance of the summer exodus. Inquir
ing whether the family there residing an
ticipated leaving the city, and, if so, what
would be their probable address on June
1. Much correspondence was had with
absentees whose addresses could be pro
cured from any source, and they were af
forded the opportunity to fill and return
by mall a special blank giving replies to
the questions upon the population sched
ule. Large additions to the population
were thus secured, and the result must
have been a certain amount of duplica
tion of names, which was not a serious
error in view of the unavoidable omis
sions on the other hand. A perfectly ac
curate enumeration la, of course, impos
sible.
By the combination of the methods *nd
devices here described a more perfect and
accurate enumeration of the population
was secured than in any previous census.
The amount of criticism in the press has
been surprisingly small and but few at
tempts have been made to secure a re
count of any city.
Statistics From Farms and Factories.
The agricultural and industrial census
present difficulties peculiar to each, quite
different from those encountered In the
listing of inhabitants. The number of
farms to be enumerated approximated
6.000,000, and of manufacturing establish
ments it was very nearly 650,000. Each of
these was reported on a eppclal schedule.
Few farmers keep books or accounts.
This is true of many small mechanics.
The larger .firms and corporations are
often most reluctant to disclose their
business, even to the Government. Much
tact and patience and some slight show
of authority are necessary in order to
secure the desired information, and part
of that secured is only an estimate, aCter
all. The manufacturing statistics were
chiefly collected by Bpecial agents,, the
schedules having been withdrawn In all
manufacturing centers from the enumer
ators. The number of special agents
was more than 2500, and the cost of field
work in this division of the census ex
ceeded $400,000. The number of agents and
cost of service in the agricultural division
was far less, because the farm statistics
were gathered by- the enumerators. .
Getting Figures on the Death Rate.
The Government attempts to secure a
statement of the number of deaths which
occbrred during the year prior to the cen
6us. Could it do so this would furnish one
of the elements needed In order to formu
late the law of grov/th of population. It
grows by births ami by immigration, but
diminishes through the operation of emi
gration and death. The aggregate change
noted from one decade to another is due
to the differences in the rates at which
these two groups of antagonistic influ
ences operate. The minor changes noted
are due. on the other hand, to removals
from place to placi within the. territory
of the United States.
Experience has shown that no accurate
return of deaths can be secured through
the enumerators. In the present census
additional information has been obtained
from the records In the offices of the Stale
and city boards of health, so that a more
probable estimate of the death rate In par
ticular localities in the country at large
can be deduced from such figures as are
available. The returns of the population
In cities by blocks will no doubt be of
much benefit by enabling city health offi
cers to locate with greater accuracy than
ever before the preclHe plague spots which
need watching and purification.
â¢ Preparing for the Tabulations.
L*t us now suppose that all the census
data have been collected, and that the
material to be worked up Into statistical
tables" is in the vau'.ta and on the shelves
of the office at Washington. What hap
pens next? ' â¢
The first effect of the completion of the
field work is the pudden and enormous
growth of the office force. What a task
this involves in the way of quick organiza
tion and painful training of raw recruits
can scarcely be Imagined. There are no
camps of instruction for this army like
those established at Chlckamauga and
elsewhere In the early days of the Span
lsh war. '-*
The * fbrpe, including- both officers and
employes, grew from twenty in March,
1899 to 238 in December of that year, and
to 701 in April, 1900.: InJune, two months
later. It was 2251; in July, 8248. and It
reached Its maximum in October, when it
was 3476. Since then it has somewhat de
clined on account of the discharges of the
clerks -temporarily: .employed in card
punching.- It still numbers, however, bo-

twecn 2500 and 3000. The total cost of the
clprlcal service to date has been in round
numbers $2,000,000.
Hut what of the count to be made by
these clerks in a limited time, since the
act orders the publication Of the final vol
umes by July 1, 1902?
First, as to the population. The popula
tion nche'dules are arranged In alphabeti
cal order by States, and in numerical or
der by supervisors' and enumerators' dis
tricts and placed In an Immense fireproof
vault built for their special accommoda
tion. Before they can be used they re
quire more or less editing to supply pal
pable omissions, correct obvious errors,
and to see that the population of incor
porated towns and villages is clearly dif
ferentiated from that of purely rural dis
tricts.
Then begins the- -labor of transcribing
all this information upon punched cards.
There is a card for every man. woman
and child enumerated, and these cards if
placed In a. pile one on top of another
would reach to a distance of ten miles
above the earth. , The answers to the in
quiries contained In the population sched
ule are indicated by the respective posi
tions of the holes punched. One thou
sand clerks were employed in this par
ticular work, and were able after acqulr
ng facility to punch 1,000,000 cards, more
or less. In a day. The punching was com
pleted in practically four months. Each
card is so marked as to admit of lden
lncation and comparison with the orig
nal schedule from which the recorded
facts were taken.
Counting by Electricity.
The counting of the entries of each de
scription Is done by a most ingenious eloc
rlcal machine Invented by Mr. Hermann
Hollerith, himself an employe of the cen
sus office in 1SSO. The essential parts of
this machine are: (1) a pinbox, with fine
needle points set on delicate spiral
Bprlnga in such manner that all or any
number of them can be shoved back into
the box when brought down, by the aid
of a. hand lever, upon the upper surface of
a card; (2) as many sets of dials and auto
matic counters as are required for a sin
gle run of the cards; (3) the necessary
relays and electrical connections. Each
card Is -successively placed in position be
neath the pinbox, the lever is pulled by
the operator, the box is "brought down and
wherever there Is no hole the needle is
shoved back and there is no count; but
wherever, a hole Is directly over a hole
In the card and passes through It an elec
trical contact endues and the current,
passing over the proper wire or wires. Is
connected to the proper counter or count
ers and the pointers affected make a
sudden jump on the face of their respect
ive dials. The advantages of this meth
od are that it Is rapid; it is automatic
and involves no waste of brain energy
on the part of the operator; It is cer
tain; it allows of counting several sets
of replies to questions at one time, and,
above all, It admits of counting these re
pliea not singly but in combination. Thus,
for example, instead of counting separ
ately the number of males, that of whites
and that of persona over voting age, we
are enabled to count at one operation the
number of males who are also white and
also of voting age. "Without this machino
the tabulation of complex results would
be too difficult and too expensive to be
made at all. Tho Bcope of the Bdentiflc
work of the census la thus Immeasurably
enlarged.
T>etectiii|r Errors by Machinery.
The machine count is divided Into what
are known as "runs," of which five or six
are required in order to complete it. At
eacli run a different group of facts is
counted. The first of these is known as
the "verification run." Its primary aim
is to discover errprs In the punching, of
which nine-tenths can be detected by the
machine, which ceases to operate when
ever a- card Is placed under the pinbox
that is inconsistent with itself or contains
any one of certain inherent inconsistencies
which -the machine lc wired to throw out.
The rejected cards are compared with the
original schedules, and new ones made to
take their place. At this preliminary run
a count Is made of tlie native and foreign
population, the negroes and whites, and
the males and females. The data for tho
published census bulletins showing the
population of the several States and Ter
ritories by* minor civil divisions were thus
obtained. Each "run" consumes nearly
or quite three months. The number of
machines In operation Is 150. for the use
of which a heavy royalty is paid; but the
saving in the cost of clerical labor Is
great, as well as In time, and a higher
uegTee of accuracy In the result is in
sured.
The Hollerith machines are used in the
division of agriculture aleo, but there they
are of a different type. The record made
on the punched card3, of which there are
two sortsâ farm and crop cards-^ls one al
most exclusively of figures, so that a dif
ferent punching device is required, and
the machine for counting out the result
is an electric adding machine of marvel
ous capacity, both in respect of the vol
ume of work accomplished and the rate
of speed at which it eats up the cards.
As soon as the count for any subdivision
of territory . is completed the result 13
copied from the dials upon "result slips."
which are handed to the clerks engaged
in tabulation, by whom the copy for the
printer is prepared.
Triumph of thÂ« Twelfth Census. â¢ .
From this brief account of the work of
the Census Office it will be seen that it Is
partly a scientific bureau, partly a manu
facturing establishment and partly a pub
lishing house. Its operations are upon a
scale so vast, and are in themselves of
such interest, that a number of repre
sentatives of foreign governments have
closely observed them, with a view to the
improvement of their own statistical
methods. The great success of the
twelfth census is another triumph of
American Inventive genius and practical
talent.
When tho four principal reports shall
have been given to the world In the form
of final volumes. Congress has authorized
the director tt> take up a list of specified
topics formerly included in the census,
but which can be Investigated without
the aid of enumerators, by correspond
ence and by special agents. These in
vestigations will be published In certain
supplemental reports. Instead . of dis
missing the entire force', as heretofore,
the best of them will be retained, and a
nucleus of experts will be on hand when
the time for taking the thirteenth census
arrives; so that more and better thought
will be given In advance to its or
ganization, and the heads of subordinate
branches of the work will not be, to so
large an extent, novices without experi
ence in their duties or special training
for them. This Is a consummation de
voutly to be wished, and public opinion

It is to be noted that the amount of the reduction is
far in excess of what was originally proposed. Sec
retary Gage recommended a reduction of $30,000,000
only. The increasing prosperity of the country, how
eevr, has been such as to make the revenues much
larger than was expected, so that the reduction of
$41,000,000 is not likely to hamper the Government in
any respect.

In his inaugural address President McKinley esti
mated it would reduce taxation by about $41,000,000,
or $1,000,000 more than was provided for in the orig
inal measure. A summary of the bill agreed upon by
the conference shows the following changes:
DESPITE the fears of the public that in the con
ference on the war tax reduction bill the Sen
ate would force the House. to accept the Sen
ate amendments, the result was a distinct triumph for
the House. The bill 25 adopted is much more like the
original bill as reported from the Committee on Ways
and Means than that sent down to the House by the
Senators. If in its present form the measure be not
wholly satisfactory, it is* certainly much better than
â¢what was threatened when the conference was ar
ranged.

"Dewet and Steyn remained irreconcil

will surrender to General French.
"According to our Information, Lord
Kitchener's dispositions made the speedy

certain. General Bgtha frankly accepted
the situation, and was treated by Lord
Kitchener at both interviews with great
consideration.

Work of Mrs. Botha.
The Dally Chronicle, referring to the
armistice at Pretoria, saye: "We learn
that the untiring agent in bringing about
the negotiations was Mrs. Botha, who
was deeply affected by the hopeless plight
of the Boers and did her utmost to in
duce her husband to accept the British
terms. The meeting of February 27 was
limited to General Botha's request to
know Lord Kitchener's terms. Lord
Kitchener replied that a general amnesty
would b<? granted to all who would sur
render as well as to all prisoners except
those Cape Dutch, who, being British
subjects, have actively fomented Boer
resistance. General Dewet and President
Steyn were, however, expressly excluded
from the amnesty.
"Lonl Kitchener further promised that,
if peace were concluded, the Government
would assist in rebuilding the farmhouses
and other buildings destroyed under mili
tary exigencies, would reinstate the law
ful owners and would help them stock
their farms. These guilty of acts of trea

Dewet and Steyn Decline.
"General Botha appeared satisfied with
the conditions. The armistice being ar

Governor Hunn declared this afternoon
that he would not appoint a United States
Senator. . . >
As President Ellison walked out he was
hissed by the Addicks men, who cried,
"Old maid!" and "Traitor!" but he was
cheered to the echo from the other side
of the house.
Speaker McCommohs in about half an
hour had restored order and quietly ad
journed the House,
Representatives Shallcross and Healy,
Democrats, locked arms and led the Dem
ocratic side of the House around the
room singing, "Hail, Hail, the Gang'a All
Here." â¢
A crowd of Addicks sympathizers
swarmed around Representative Chandler,
one of the regular Republican leaders,
whp was cheering vigorously. "Shoot
him! Stick a knife in him!" they shout
ed, and Colonel Morrow, Major Mitchell
and several detectives crowded around
Chandler, who kept on cheering. A union
Republican Senator approached Chandler
and jumped on a chair, yelling, "Three
groans for the Republican traitors!"
Friends urged the men to desist.

The ballot for the short term resulted:
Saulsbury, 23; Addicks 22; Richards, Reg

The two houses at 12:22 o'clock separat

ballot was at an enl with a double dead

regular Republicans who have steadfact

the twenty-three Democrats.
Forty-five ballots have been taken in
joint session since the balloting began on
January 16.
OVER, Del.. March 8.â The last
day of the present session of the
Legislature brought a large
crowd to Dover. Promptly at 12
o'clock the Senate entered the
House chamber, where the joint session
of the two houses was held. There was
intense excitement when the presiding of
ficer called for the ballot on United States
Senator. The vote lor the full term re
sulted as follows: Kenney. Democrat, 23;
Addicks, Union Republican, 16; Dupont,
Regular Republican. 7; Hlggins, Regular
Republican, 6; necessary to a choice, 27.
The crowds rushed about in an almost
frenzied manner, shouting out the names
of the seven Republicans who refused to
vote for Addicksâ Senators Knox and El
lison and Representatives Clark, Chand
ler. Flynn. Hodgson and Pillling. The
other side cheered for Addicks at the
"Vote it down." was shouted from their
section of the chamber. Amid the gTeat
est confusion the roll was called and as
the Democrats and regular Republicans
were solidly together the motion was
carried. When President Ellison's gavel

that the Joint session was ended there

the expiration of former Senator-An
thony Hlggins' term in 1S95. Higgins was
a candidate for re-.circtlon, but was op
posed by J. Edward Addicks, who had
recently moved to Delaware from Phila
delphia. Addicks neadlocked the Legis r
lature and made thj threat that the Sen

deadlock has existed ever since, and the
factional fight has been perhaps the bit
terest in the history of American politics.
The motion to separate, which was made
by Senator Knox, regular Republican of
Wilmington, was a complete surprise to
thfe union Republicans.

Baxj to commit him to some institution
vherc he could have proper care and

pesEjon he lost to a great decree control
over his motions and his speech.. He at
tended the sittings of the House with
rpgularity, however, and it was not until
the session of Sunday afternrv>n before
lnaug-uration day that his condition be
came generally noticeable. On that day
it was evident even to occupants of the

"In my opinion such a statute is an in
vitation to the unscrupulous and design
ing to prostitute it to unworthy and'igno
ble purposes, and singles out the District
Judges as the special marks fAr. the char
acter assassin. Of late years It has be
come quite the thing for irresponsible par
ties, by innuendo if not by open charges,
to impugn the motives and attack the in
tegrity of those in political and official
life. -The avenues that lead to this should
be circumscribed rather than enlarged.
"In the main this has been cpnflnea to
representatives in the State Legislature
and the National Congress. Fortunately,
however, it has come to be recognized
that there is scarcely anything more
harmless than political malice, but when
avarice and greed, robed in the disguise
of injured innocence, open- up a new high
way by which they may enter the tem
ples for destruction of personal and of
ficial reputations it is time for public sen
timent to assert itself and uncompromis
ingly set its face against them."
In conclusion the Governor says: "If the
apprehension of danger be sufficient to
suggest the necessity of such a law as
Senate bill No. 87, lei the law be made
broad enough to meet every emergency In
every court and the constitution amended
to provide for a 'Supreme Court Commis
sion,' to sit only when required for the
purpose, instead of making the invidious
distinction now contemplated at the be
hests of those who insist biennially upon
parading their imaginary grievances be
fore the legislative Assembly.
"But I am frank to say that such action
as I. have suggested Is as unnecessary and
Inexpedient as the bill under considera
tion. A measure which. In my opinion, is
demanded by no public interests Is the
outgrowth of a sordid sentiment emanat
ing from litigants suffering or apprehend
ing no real Injury, but manifestly an ef
fort in disguise to obtain some undue ad
vantage over in adversary in a lawsuit
by placing impediments in the way of
speedy, trials and otherwise defeating the
ends of Justice."
HELENA. Mont.. March S.â Governor
Joseph K. Toole to-day .vetoed the meas
ure commonly known as the "change of
venue bill." It provides that when "Judi
cial prejudice" could be. shown on the
part of the presiding Judgeâ such preju
dice to be shown by oral testimony â a
change of .venue could be demanded, and
if refused by the Judge himself appeal
could be taken to the Supreme Court, and
that body could grant such charge of
venue. ' .
The Amalgamated Copper Company and
others were oommonly recognized as the
men urging the bill. T.'ie Helnze interests
were opposing It. Its purpose, according
to the general understanding, was to en
able the Amalgamated Copper Company
to get a change of venue Irom Silver Bow
County, where It has an Innumerable num-^
ber of lawsuits with the Heinze people
on the dockets.
In the course of his reason for vetoing
the bill Governor Toole says:

Alcatraz Island Is to have a new com
manding officer. Orders were issued yes
terday assigning Lieutenant Colonel S. H.
Lincoln to that post.
Lieutenants Wiley Mangum, Charles
Burnett and Arthur J. Lynch, recently
graduated from AVest Point, have been
assigned to duty with the Fifteenth Cav
alry, now being organized at the Presidio.
Major R. T. Yeatman, who was in com
mand of the detachment of i*ough recruits
sent here from New York, has been given
command of the First Battalion of the
Twenty-eighth Infantry.
The Second Battalion of the Tenth In
fantry arrived at the Presidio late last
night. Colonel Duggan. who Â¦ is In com
mand, reports 547 men In the battalion.
Two hundred and thirteen volunteers
were given their discharge yesterday
from the Presidio.
The men who caused the row have be
fore them the prospect of spending from
one to five years at Alcatraz, as their of
fense is a serious one. â¢ â¢ .
Not satisfied with refusing to obey or
ders, the three men called the officer of
the day all sorts of names. During the
scuffle the rest of the battalion stood
around, seemingly amused at the display
of drunken courage, but they were dis
persed by the threat of a few hours' ex
tra drill. ...
The row started over the refusal of the
three culprits to obey Lieutenant Hal
stead, officer of the day, who ordered the
men arrested. When the guard attempt
ed to obey the command of the officer It
met with a determined resistance, and' it
was only after the employment of con
siderable force that the soldiers were
placed In confinement.
The officers commanding the Twenty
eighth Infantry were kept busy yester
day tfternoon subduing a lot of recruits
who had partaken a little too freely of the
various brands of fire-water sold in the
neighborhood of the Presidio. Had it not
been for the strict enforcement of mili
tary discipline a wholesale riot might
have occurred, but the disturbance was
stopped before the mutinous feeling be
came general. Three men were hand
cuffed and Ironed before the disturbance
was quelled, however, and they will have
to answer to the serious charges of
drunkenness, disobedience of orders and
resisting an officer.

Recently some of the soldiers stationed
at the Presidio have been spending the
money they received as wages in saloons
and when Intoxicated have had little re
gard for law and order. For the past
three nights extra details of patrolmen
were required on Kearny and Pacific
streets, and many tlm^s riots have oc
curred, in which the officers were obliged
to use their clubs freely.

TRUCULENT "ROOKIES"
ARE ON THE RAMPAGE
HUGO TOLAND Is about to turn
benedict. illsS Gertrude Tidball
is the lady who has lured *lm
from bachelordom and who
' early In June will make him the
happiest of men. Toland kept his engage
ment to Miss Tidbail a dead secret. He
told none of his professional friends or
associates of his happiness. Only a few
Intimate friends of the lady were told
that the wedding bells were soon- to ring
outâ and of course there was the "little
bird" who hears all and tells all.
When Toland was seen last evening at
the Columbia Theater he confessed that
he had placed a solitaire on Miss Tidball' s
third finger, left hand, but begged that
the announcement of the tender fact be
withheld until he had left town.
. "I have: so many friends." pleaded To
land. "Then to-morrow is a matinee, and
what with drinking congratulations and
playingâ oh. I don't know what will be
come of me."
Hugo Toland Is one of the most popular
men connected with the stage and Is
equally well liked in exclusive social cir
cles. He is a San Francisco boy, son of
the late Dr. Toland. one of the most prom
inent of the pioneer physicians and foun
der of the Toland Medical College. Be
fore adopting the stage Toland gave much
of his time to society, and when he quitted
the ballroom for the footlights many a
belle was Inconsolable.
Miss Tidball Is the daughter of Mrs.
Keeling of Berkeley and is socially and
professionally well known in this city
She graduated from Mills College about
four years ago ano shortly after made
her professional dol-ut at the Alcazar
Theater. For the pact three seasons Miss
Tidball has been playing with Eastern
companies and is new with Nat Goodwin
and Maxine Elliott.
"I did not,", replied Carpenter. "When
I reached the upper deck I met Captain
Ward. I asked him if we were in a se
rious position. He replied that he thought
that we were in a dangerous place, and
asked me to co below and awaken the
other passengers.- 'When I went below the
steward was rapping on the doors of the
rooms and calling out. "First call for
breakfast.' I^presume that he wanted to
get the passengers out of their berths
without causing any unnecessary excite
ment. I felt so secure in the safety of the
vessel that I proceeded to my cabin and
completed my toilet. When I again
reached the upper deck there did not seem
to be any danger. ' The whistles were
blowing. The officers were lowering the
boats. Everything was conducted In an
orderly manner. 1 met Mrs. Wildman on
the deck. She was insisting upon the
nurse going below to get the baby's shoes.
The nurse refused to go. I would have
gone after the shoes had it not been that
at that time I noticed the steamship was
commencing to list. It was then that I
first feared for the safety of the vessel.
The boats were being lowered on the star
board side. There was a sudden lurch and
the vessel pitched over. I think that ev
erything possible was done by the officers
to save the crew and passengers."
"How *o you account for the loss of so
many of the passengers?" asked Inspector
Bolles. I
"I believe that many of those who were
In the boats were killed by the wreckage
when the steamship turned over and went
down," answered the' witness. "They had
not (?ot away a sufficient distance from
the Rio before she turned over and Bank.
There is no doubt in my mind that many
of the passengers ' were in their rooms
when the vessel sank."
"Did you believe that there was any im
mediate danger?" asked Inspector- Bolles.
"I was up when the Rio de Janeiro
struck," he said. "I hurried on deck. The
fog was thick, but you could- see about
thirty-five or fortv yards ahead. I /was
surprised <to see the fog. for if was per
fectly clear when we left the anchorage.
My first Impression was that we had run
ashore on the . beach below the Cliff
House."
The Investigation conducted by the
United States Inspectors of Hulls and
Boilers intq- the Bio de Janeiro disaster
was concluded yesterday, but it will be
fully two weeks before Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger make public their report.. The
only witness examined yesterday was J.
K. Carpenter, who was a passenger on
the Ill-fated steamship. His testimony did
not throw any new light on the disaster.
Carpenter, who has traveled extensively,
said that he never met a better set of of
ficers than were in charge of the steam
ship.
Passenger Carpenter of the Rio Tells
His Story to the Inspectors.
SAYS CREW ACTED WELL.
"Because." replied Mr. Coghlan, "after
the ship struck she listed a little to port
and then listed an angle of 25 or 30 de
grees to starboard and in order to get at
the boats divers would have been neces
sary to work under water. The passen
gers didn't seem to realize their danger
and we were obliged to put some of them
into the boats forcibly."
An adjournment was then had until 9
a. m. to-day.
"Then, Mr. Coghlan," asked Major
Blakeney, "since ten minutes elapsed
from the time the ship struck until she
went down, how was it that the boats
and rafts were not lowered and the lives
of the passengers and crew were not
saved?" V
Second Officer Graham Coghlan was re
called at 1 p. m., and said that the Rio
carried a patent sounding machine, but
that it was not used in coming into the
harbor on the occasion of the shipwreck,
although it had been used frequently on
other occasions. He repeated his former
testimony that after he left the bridge
the whistles were tied down so that they
emitted continuous blasts. The rafts and
boats, he added, were sufficient to take all
the passengers and the crew. Ordinarily,
as In the case of a man overboard. It did
not require more than two and a half min
utes to lower a boat.
Mr. McAllister then retired, and Cap
tain Varney and Captain Hodgson. of the
life-saving stations, were- called to prove
that the watchmen in their charge had
punched. the time dials every half hour
from 4 o'clock until 8 on tne morning of
the shipwreck. The object of this testi
mony was- to show that the life-saving
people .were awake at those times, but
the witnesses were not asked how it was
that the distress Blgnals of the sinking
steamer and the cries of her passengera
were either unheard or unheed<Â»d by their
watchmen.
Privates H. C. Taylor. S. O. Brldgens
and F. M. George of the United States
army, who were on sentry duty at Fort
Point at the time of the wreck, said in
answer tt> a question b>\ Ward McAllister,
counsel for the Pacific Mall Steamship
Company, that simultaneously with the
sound of the long and lotld blasts from
the steam, whistle of the Rio they heard
the shouts of the male passengers and
the screams of the women and children
coming out of. the fog pear the Golden
Gate. Sergeant SanfoiM testified that
there seemed to be a large crowd of peo

VICTIM'S CRIES
CLEARLY HEARD
Unfortunately Williams has not the
funds to visit New York at once, or had
not yesterday, by his own statement. The
lluiiigans sent him $125, he admits, but.
he pays, bein? overcome with grief at the
oeath ct Ms wife, which happened recent
lv. h? spent the mone;.- in the saloons of
S^an Francisco. Since then, however, he
has received a di?patch from Mulligan
telling him to come on as far as his
money will bring him and then telegraph
for more. Williams said he would start
East in a day or two.
There are contradictions of a radical
port between the statements Williams
makes ard those made by persons who
figure in his recent history. He says the
Personal estate of the late Mrs. Williams
amounts or.ly to jywO, whereas Mr. Mul
ligan, acc-.rdim? to the press reports from
New York, mak^s it $20,000. He Insists
that he came here under duress, and Al
bert Gre<n. son of the executrix of the
Williams estate, says he was persuaded
to come because the friends of Mrs. Wil
liams were afraid hip acts in New York,
he having be<;n drinking heavily, would
shorten her life If he remained in the me
tropolis. Green also alleges that Williams
insisted that ihe will that is now claimed
to be forced should be drawn before he
would i<Â»?.ve New York, and that h<Â» came
to thÂ»- coast willingly enough when that
na.5 done. The wll! shows that Williams
5f to receive $13 per we^k from the rer
Â»on:i! estate of his >vife until the principal
is exhausted, and that he is also to get
half of the reoi estate.
TTilliam H. 'Willlanis of New York, now
ecjourrJne: In San Francisco, has blood In
his eye. He Is threatening- to return to
New York to bare Mrs. Lena Green, the
executrix of the estate of his late wife,
arrested. He does not make clear the
charge that he will bring, but he has two
alleged grievances. One is that the prop
erty of the late Mrs. Williams is being
Â¦withheld from him through the terms of a
forged will, and the other Is that he was
brought to San Francisco while under the
influence of liquor, without his knowledge
cr consent. Ha does not aJlegre that Mrs.-
Green forged the will, but says she caused
his deportation to this city and Is bene
f.rir.e by the will.
He el?o affirms that his cousins, Mr.
ar.d Mrs. Mulligan of 727 Fremont avenue.
New York, ara winners under the will.
They have charge of the real estate which
his wif<Â» left, amounting to about $40,000.
so he claims. Yesterday Williams exhib
ited a copy of the alleged Â¦will. It was
witnessed by Mrs. Frederick Johnson and
Charlie Herrmann, both of Â£25 St. Ann's
avenue. New York, but the document fails
to show that ir was acknowledged before
a notary. It was signed Â¦with the name
of Mrs. Williams, the signature being
ecrawiing and uncertain. Williams says
he has proof In a letter received from his
â¢wife since he arrived at San Francisco
that the signature is a forgery- Tne sig
nature to the letter is wholly unlike that
en the will.

The first popular excursion of the sea

San Francisco to Bakersfield. and ia
given by the Southern Pacific in response
to the very general desire to see the oil
fields and understand from a practical
f>oint of view what all this oil commotion
3 about. Hundreds of business men in
this city who are more or less Interested
In oil have never seen a derrick and all
they know about oil ia the din and babel
of the OH Exchange. Going right into th?
Kern River oil fields under ordinary cir
cumstances consumes valuable time anl
Is somewhat expensive. This excursion
reduces that fact to a minimum by taklns
no time out of business hours, cutting the
transportation expense almost in half and
giving a whole day for inspection.
The special train, composed of Pullman
buffet sleepers and day coaches, leaves
at 7 o'clock and returns early Monday
morning. Round trip to Bakersfleld $10.

Deckhands Quit a Steamer Because
Increase in Pay Is Refused.
There was > trouble on the Sacramento
River .steamer Pride of. the Rlrer yester
day and in consequence fourteen deck
hands walked out. The steamer brought
down 7000 sacHf of potatoes and when she
docked all hands thought they were go
ing to be paid off and the vessel tied up.
Instead the agents ordered- her out on an
other trip. The crew then refusal to
handle the freight for their pay of $30 a
month, but instead askrd for 40 cents an,
hour, the regular . longshoremen's ratÂ«Â».
Their demand was refuted and the men
quit.
The longshoremen were then called In
and refused to handle the potatoes for Ies3
than 1 cent a sack, which averages nearly
DO cents an hour. The longshoremen were
employed and by the time the cargo was
out a new crew had been secured and the
Pride of the River was ready for another
trip to Sacramento. â¢

FATHER WYMAN'S
ANNIVERSARY
The - substitution of an elderly China
man, for the 15-year-old . Chan Ylt in the
detention shed at the . Mail dock has
opened- up the probability of numerous
other substitutions having been made
there and the likelihood that bribery may
have been resorted to. The detention shed
belongs to the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, which uses it as a storefoom
for Chinese immigrants pending the de
termination of their right to be landed
and their deportation when denied land-
Ing by the Collector of the Port. The shed
is constructively the steerage of the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company and the
company is responsible for the safe keep-
Ing of the coolies. The company has
watchmen and these' are assisted by spe
cial watchmen appointed by the Collector
and paid at the rate of 573 per month. Re
cently eleven Chinese Immigrants escaped
from the shed through -a back window
while one of these special watchmen was
on duty. ..
Collector Stratton announced yesterday
that he had come to the conclusion that
substitutions were much more frequent
than is generally suspected.- He believed
also that the system . of hiring special
watchmen Is not Judicious.
"They are not under the civil service
system," he added, "and they are liable
to be dismissed at any time and other
men may be appointed to their places.
Seventy-five dollars per month under such
conditions is not much of an inducement
when confronted with a possible bribe of
1500. I know that there have been Chinese
in that shed, merchants In factâ but tech
nically not such, because they may have
a restaurant or a pawnbroklng establish
ment connected with their businessâ who
cannot get in and. who would. gladly pay
$500 or $1000 to be landed. I think It would
be safer to dispense with special watch
men and fill their places with customs in
spectors, who are under the civil service
system and who would not be likely to
accept bribes and jeopardize their life po
sitions." ' ". Â¦ "-. Â¦ Â¦
No trace has been found of the missing
Chan' Yit 15 years old. . The 50-year-old
Chan Ylt was smuggled into the shed. He
was willing to accept a free passage to
China and he was put Into the shed by
some derelict otticlal so that the total
number of Inmates might not be reduced.
Declares That Substitutions Like
Those of Chan Yit Are More Fre
quent Than Has Seen
Suspected.
> Â¦ . -
Collector Stratton Thinks
That Bribery Was
Employed.
CROOKED WORK
AT MAIL DOCK
Every effort is to be made by represen
tatives of local commercial bodies to se
cure a class of desirable settlers for Cal
ifornia. These are to be drawn from the
colonists that are expected to visit this
State by reason of the present colony
rates established by the various railroads
centering here. In order to concentrate
efforts at a meeting held yesterday after
noon at the Chamber of Commerce It was
decided that the new body should be
known as the California Colony Associa
tion.
W. M. Bunker called the assemblage to
order and H. P. Sonntag took the chair.
Proceedings were opened by the Introduc
tion of the following resolutions read by
Secretary Weil:
Whereas, Through the action of the trans
portation companies in providing for the in
troduction of desirable immigrants into the
State a welcome emergency Is about to be
created and we are suddenly to enjoy unus
ual opportunities for settling our vacant land
and generally increasing the prosperity of the
State; therefore, be it
Resolved, That a. permanent organization,
known as the California Colony Association,
be formed for the purpose of disseminating
information regarding available lands and la
bor, to co-operate with all other organiza
tions of a kindred character throughout the
State nnd to iierform all other acts that will
further the object of the association.
A committee on organization, composed
of R. B. Jennings, Hugh Craig. Isidore
Jacobs, H. P. Sonntng and N. B. Greens
felder. named the following as permanent
officers:
H. D. Loveland of Tillmann & Bendel. pres
ident: A. Sbarboro of Italian Swiss Colony,
first vice president : Harry Holbrook of Hol
brook. Merrill & Stetson, second vice presi
dent; Joe Sloss of Miller, Sloss & Scott,
treasurer; William M. Weil of William M.
Well Company, secretary.
A number of communications were read,
one urging that efforts be made to induce
discharged soldiers to remain In the State
instead of yielding to the efforts of rail
road agents to get them away. The com
munication stated that the writer thought
It would be better to keep the soldiers
here in preference to letting them go
East. Another letter was from a Florida
preacher and orange grower, who said he
had lost three orchards in three succes
sive bad winters and was desirous of j
bringing a number of disgusted Florida
residents to the coaft. These letters will i
receive due attention. '
It was reported that thirty-three car
loads of excursionists were on their way
here and in order that there might be no
feeling of sectional Jealousy regarding: the
distribution of visiting tourists it was de
cided to make the California Colony Asso

There is a sreat uproar In the State
ever the last oil bulletin prepared by Pro
fessor Watt for the State Mining Bureau,
and which was printed by the State print
ing office. It is only procurable at the
present time upon payment of from Jt 50
to 53 a copy. There are about 3000 incor
porated oil companies In the State. Pre
sumably every one of these companies haa
been a candidate for the possession, of at
least one copy of the bulletin In question.
Prof3ssor Watt put In many months
looking over the State and studying oil
indications. He took a camera along. and t
the bulletin was illustrated with numer-*
ous pictures, showing all about anticlines
and seepages and other things that are a
part of the furniture of the oil fields.
Every prospector was led to regard the
bulletin as a sort of ready handbook to oil
lore, and the rush for copies when they
arrived in San Francisco was tremendous.
Oil experts have inquired recently at the
Mining Bureau for copies. Mr. Jacobs,
the clerk who has charge of the literature
of the bureau, has told every one that
there were no more copies for distribu
tion. Within the last few weelts track of
a few vagrant copies has been discovered.
The second-hand book men are found to
have a supply of them. They sold them
out at not less than Jl 50 a copy to a spec
ulator, and the same copies have been
sold subsequently to oil men for advanced
prices. Some of these copies have been
procured by Clerk Jacobs and he haa
placed them in the way of inquirers. Now
he wishes thai he had not tried to be so
accommodating, for there are some who
have insinuated that he was making
money out of the transaction. This he in
dignantly denies, and he is upheld in this
denial by the State Mineralogist.
1 There were only 3000 copies published.
One-half of that number came to San
Francisco: the remainder were distributed
in Sacramento. Every member of tfto
Legislature received copies. The disposi
tion of the other coplea In Sacramenta la
not known here. From the indications
many of them ultimately found their way
to the second-nand bookstores, and the
shrewd book men are reaping a bonanza.
This Is not a new feature of the Mining:
Bureau reports. They have been sold for
years at a profit In the second-hand book
storesâsometimes at $5 a volume, though
they cost the book men nothing.

COFFEE HITS HARD.
Almost Killed a California Girl.
A young lady in California had a re-
markable experience with coffee drinking.
The details are most interesting to any
cr.e who even suspects that coffee Is dam-
aging to the heaith. She says: "I drank
coffee from a child, and a few years ago
xny health begran to break down, every-
thfrig I ate or drank distressed me, and I
eettled into a chronic form of dyspepsia,
fiocompanled with a headache every
morning, and was very irritable most of
the time. I could not sleep without tak-
ing a fleering draught. While at first the
pains in Â¦ my etomach were slight, they
kept prowing worse, until finally the most
v.holesome food and drink would cause
intense agony, and a few minutes after
eating I would have to throw everything
up. My doctor had been telling me for
some time that coffee was hurting me,
but I did not believe it was true, for I
f aw many people drink coffee and thought
I could.
"Of course, in- this condition I could not
t-jptain xny flesh and strength, and I lout
in weight from 185 pounds down to 90
pounds, and became a perfect skeleton,
starving to death in a land of plenty. I
was confined to my bed and dying b>-
inches. The doctor told me there was no
chance of my ever getting well, as my
Ftomnch was worn out.
"â¢They had begun to wonder how many
mere days I would live. One day a lady
friend called and told how wonderfully
she had been helped out of stomach
trouble and headaches by leaving off cof-
fee and udng Postum Food Coffee and
Grape-Nuts Food. She went right to
work end made me a nice cup of Postum
and prepared a little Grape-Nuts. I
dreaded the torture of taking anything
into my s-tomach. but she coaxed me to
take a spoonful of Postum and of Grape-
Nuts. To my great surprise, I found that
I did not have any pain to speak of in
my stomach, and the food actually stayed
down.
"Every one was completely mystified. In
a little time afterward I drank threo
spoonfuls of the Poetum and took a little
more of the Grape-Nuts, and that stayed
down and seemed to soothe my nerves
and give me a restful feeling.
"Soon aft*r the doctor came in and my
nurce told him that, for the first time in
three weeks, food had stayed on tho
stomach. He could hardly believe her. as"
he tjioueht death was very near. Then
he wanted to know what I Tiad been eat-
ing and drinking. He took home some of
the Grape-Nuts and Postum. The next
day he taSd there was no mystery about
it. as he had analyzed the samples and
s-aid he had found a pre-digested food,
tx.d one that would not hurt the stomach,
and the Postum was the most natural
drink he had ever seen. He said that it
did not excite the nerves as did coffee,
and that it was nourishing and built up
the pystem instead of tearing it down. Hq
had my nurse give me more of the Pos-
tum and Orape-Nuts and said there was
one chance in ten that my system might
be built up and my life be saved. -':"<.
"In less than a week's time I could
drink half a cup of Postum at once, and
how it did quiet my nerves and make me
feel like I was getting some strength.
"Six days after beginning Postum I
Â¦went to eleep the first time in two zndnths
without . taking a Bleeping draught. " So
etep by Etep 1 kept on Improving. The
headaches disappeared. My stomach be-
came stronger each day and I gained
steadily in weight.
"At the end of four months I felt like a.
new person, and had gained fifty pounds
in weight, could sleep well, eat plain food;
and. all in all. feel well and .strong again.
"My head is so clear that I can think
better than I ever could. I know, and all
of our friends know, that there Is not the
Elightest doubt but that I would be In my
grave to-day, but for Postum Food Coffee
and Grape-ICuts.

wish, but please enly use my. initials.';

.'NETvr iTORKj, March S.â Bradstreet' s Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: Although not
a little strength was shown In the movement
of prices, speculation has been Irregular in Its
tendencies through the week. The so-called
steel deal has been the topic which received the
preatest amount of attention In Wall street,
but the greatest amount of interest in the mat
ter took the form of a discussion of Its form
and rrobable effects rather than any marked
disposition to operate cither !n the shares of
the United States Steel corporation or those of
Its prospective constituent companies. The ac
tivity of the market. In fact, waa shown in
other parts of the list and was of a somewhat
diversified kind. Railroad chares, headed by
Pennsylvania and other standard stocks came
in for a good share of attention, and the
strength and advances in this quarter contrib
uted toward the upward movements which took
place in Union Pacific. Atchlson and the Pacific
securities. The Grangers also had their share
of attention, Burlington being a strong feature
on reports of a deal of some kind, and efforts
were made apparently to revive the Interest in
the anthracite shares, though they were checked
by the fear that labor troubles In the coal re
gion are apprehended. Various specialties also
asFumed prominence, the,, most conspicuous
movement of this kind being in Amalgamated
Copper shares, which rose from 93 at the close
of last week to 103% on reports as to the con
per mining and legislative situation In Mon
tana, where the company's chief Interests ate
centered.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March f.~ There was a very
animated speculation in a few of the mo*t
prt-rr.lnont lnduptrials In the market to-day
an<l ncrne large operations in one or two rall
r'M<\ Ftockf. The day's activities were much
rongr^ted In Â«h" quarters Indicated. Trading
In the general \\n was, in faot. pmall and
rÂ«th*>r unimiv.rtant. and the movement in
l<rlce* was nluggifb. The number of issues
<*Â«"alt in. however, continues very large, owing
mant rlao-*Â« in the lift for an adjustment of
values to the rhanped level in the active list.
The rroeptiven*^* in the speculative mind to
onytbing In the nature of a euggÂ«Â»Â»tion of con
srilidatii n or Â« merger brings a quick renponse
11 anv manipulation In these minor properties.
But the purely f t>eculatlve movement in the
mercurial industrials was the leading charac
teristic of to-day's market. Sugar and Amala
mÂ»t*^l Copper were mojrt prominent In th*
<!eÂ«lingK. There wae mrae evidence of a specu
lative contPFt betw^rn the friends of the two
rtrxfcs. very large dealings In which were for
Boston account. Sugar sold ex dividend of Hi
per cent, and was not long In recovering that
â¢mount. Later It was lifted over 4 points on
very lsrse dealings, with accompanying ru
morfi ..f nn adjustment of trade rivalries. In
frmff drawn from the large increase shown
hv the statement of the company made In
Maffiachufetts In the amounts of the Invest
ment*, in the other companies held the advance.
Amalcamated Copper rose at one time 2H on
â¢pcount of the adjournment of the Montana
L^giy'.ature. which was taken as averting the
probability of hostile measures, but in the
late dr-Ti'.lr.K* the ctock slumped under a flood

with a net loss of Â£3*. The market was weak

Â¦^CHICAGO, March S.â At the opening the
situation looked bearish. Liverpool reflected
the slump here yesterday. Argentine ship
ments were liberal and Northwest receipts con
siderably larger than tney were the same day
last week. The weathsr was mild and moist,
but at this season of the year prospects of a
freeze 'may be taken as almost assured, hence
the weather. If anything, was bullish. This
had some influence in holding the market at
the beginning, although one bull leader and
a handful of followers were compelled to con
test the field against the great majority of the
pit; May opened a shade lower to Vk@U<: higher
at 75c to 75%!ji73^4c. The meager crowd of de
fenders of the price were swept away by
force of numbers and the market was poundeil
down to ~\%<(iH%c. The decline caught stop
orders under 75c, all of which assisted the mar
ket along on the downward path. Corn at thl.Â«
period developed considerable strength. Shorts
began to cover on belt<.*r export movement and
the market rallied to "u^c and closed hie
higher at 75Vlfo75%c.
Corn was moderately active and generally
steady even when wheat was at Us worst. May
closed H@%c higher at 41c- Â¦ , â¢
Oats were more active than for some time.
It was strong In sympathy with corn. May
closed H@Â»^c higher at 25@25VÂ»c.
In the provision pit May pork was .the ad
mired object of speculators, especially of
shorts. The market for this product opened 5c
higher and was bid up sharply, closing 37>,ic
over yesterday. Lard closed 2Vi@5c higher and
ribs 5(57%c higher.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â The markets all over the world
were inactive and featureless.
Chicago opened firm but quiet and primary
receipts continued large, contrary tq expecta
tions. A good many holders liquidated on
this account and the feeling became weak,
though bidding by Armour tended to check
the decline. Minneapolis reported an ex
pected Increase of 150,000 bushels for the
week, though the demand for Flour was good
and the millers were good buyers of cash
Wheat. The strength of Corn served to help
the Wheat bulls. Argentine shipments for
the week were 1,603,000 bushels, against 3,23:!,
000 for the same week last year.
This market showed more activity on call
at about previous prices.

NEW TORK. March $.â At the opening of
the cotton market to-day prices advanced 10@13
points on general buying, but particularly
among the shorts, owing to better cables from
Liverpool than expected. The March option
sold up to 8.50c: May, S.53c; July, 8.66c, and
August. 8.29c. The demand here was supplied
by commission-houses and the largest spot cot
ton interests were heavy sellers. This caused
a slump, and when later cables reported a loss
of all the early advance at Liverpool, with the
closing prices showing a net decline of about
1 point, there wan a break here to about last
night's prices. Thereafter the market followed
an irregular course. At the close the market
was very steady, with pi Ices showing a rise of
9Â® 15 points for the day.

NEW YORK, March S.â Money on call steady
where It Is being utilized It Is reported very
satisfactory. Still there will always be a â¢lf
mand for about l.JCO.OOO tons of coal in Cal.
ftrnia for domestic, steamer and gas uses,
I'nless the price of oil shall seriously d?cllnÂ».
This is very questionable, as the.preient rail
road freight on oil from Kern and Fresno
ccuntles is equal to $1 ft) per ton on coal, and
they show no disposition to modify the same.
The carrier at present receives more than thÂ«
producer. Contracts are being drawn for lib
eral supplies of oil for the Hawaiian Islands,
to be transported by tank steamers, at prices
which will save the consumer equal to $2 p*r
ton less .than they are now paying for coal.
There are at present seventy-nine vessels etÂ»
routs and chartered to load coal from Aus
tralia for the islands. This will give an Idea
of the magnitude of this trade." .

NEW YORK, March S.â R. G. Dun & Co.'b
Weekly Review or Trade to-morrow will say:
Little change was developed this week in the
condition of general business. The ground re
cently gained seemed to be held without diffi
culty with a good distribution of merchandise
by jobbers in most directions and, with entire
absence of speculative activity. There has been
a lurther decline in cotton, which does not help
the goods market, still the most backward and
disappointing of all . the great Industries, but
in mechanical lines the progress being made
is noteworthy. Building materials, including
lumber, are in especially urgent demand and
dealers who can deliver stock have no diffi
culty in securing advanced prices. In this, un
like most other Ilne3 of business, the Eaat
leads the country and Just at this season It Is
of particular significance. Collections are re
ported good all through the West and are bet
ter than usual at the South.
Conditions in iron and steel begin to assume
an appearance similar to that of 1S99. Prices
have moved up rapidly since the upturn was
made and bids at current rates for distant Je
llvery ! are often refused. Manufacturers are
unanimously representing a great demand for
domestic consumption, while export contracts
for finished forms are still taken in competition
with declining foreign markets.
Footwear Is steady at former prices, . and
while- sales have decreased somewhat, factories
arc assured of activity lor a month or more.
There Is good demand for low-priced heavy
goods from Southern Jobbers, but many West
ern buyers have not placed their usual con
tracts as yet. The local jobbing trade has im
proved and city wholesalers have liberal orders
from country retailers. Large contracts ha\;e
been placed with Western manufacturers, wno
report conditions satisfactory.
Textile fabrics exhibit a little animation, al
though the markets are still far from a satis
factory position. Two large failures In wool
occurred abroad and three Vermont concerns
were forced to suspend. Sales of wool at the
three chief Eastern markets decreased nearly
3.000,000 pounds, compared with the previous
week's business, but this a favorable symptom,
as excessive operations of late were due to
forced sales at lower prices.
Wheat Is in abundant supply with quotations
well above last year's, owing to reports of the
Hcsflan fly, which promises to be unusually
troublesome, while weather conditions nre rIpo
threatening. " Atlantic exports of wheat, .flour
Included, were 2,477.990 bushels for the week,
against 1.7S1.S95 bushels a year ago, while corn
exports were 2.337,432 bushels, against 2,183,21$
bushels In 1900. Heavy supplies of coffee at
last prevailed over manipulation and prices de
clined.
Failures far the week were 20S In the United
State?, against 2C5 last year and 26 in Canada
against S3 last year.

become active and stronger on the report that a

ican department was slacked at first, like the
general list. There war slight selling pressure
In the early hours, to which Berlin contributed
with offers cf Ealtimori; and Ohio. The rally
In the afternoon was caused by buying ordei"s

Most l'.nea of 'distributive spring trade are '

however, about all that Is unfavorable has
been enumerated.
The season of winter wheat crOD scares Is
now approaching, but the market Is dull, nar
row and irregular. Speculation is almost nil
Corn has weakened but slightly on better
weather and bearish statistics of .farm reserves

Chicago Society Man and
Former Soubrette Ar
rive From OgdÂ«n.
Edward Ellis Hamlln, a young society
man of Chicago who married Miss Mabel
Hite, the soubrette of the "Telephono
ulrl," In . Ogden on March 3, after two
days' courtship, arrived on the overland
last night, accompanied by his pretty
wife. They are registered at the Palace
Hotel.
Hamlln says that they are out here to
spend their honeymoon and will pay a
visit to the southern i>art of the State be
fore they leave for the TSast. He claims
that hlB father Is Immensely rich and a
member of the firm cf Marshall Field &
Co.- of Chicago. He also says that Ma
parents are pleased that he is married
and that they will Bee that he and his
newly made bride are provided with a lib.
eral allowance.
â¢The courtship of Hamlln and Miss
Mabel Hite was most romantic. When
the "Telephone Girl"' company was play
ing at the Taber Theater In Denver Ham
lln fell in love with the fair soubrette thiÂ»
moment she tripped out before the foot
lights. He threw a bouquet on the stage,
which â¢ was gracefully acknowledged by
Miss Hite. At the close of the perform
ance the ever-to-be-found mutual friend
Introduced the couple. The company left
for Ogden the same night, followed by
Hamlin. They were married at the Ke>i
yon Hotel In, Ogden, a member of the
company, Steve Holllday, acting as bes;
man. ..
Hamlin was, so it is claimed, engaged
to | a Chicago young woman named , Lou
Martin, who followed nlm to Denver. He
also paid a great deal of attention to Miss
Maybelle Myers, a belle of Denver. Ham
lin has been married before, his first wife
being Miss Nancy Stutt of Chicago, from
whom he obtained a divorce. \
HAMLIN IS HERE
WITH HIS BRIDE
ple "With Musical Lecture.
At the Metropolitan Temple last even
ing a large house was royally entertained
by Father McLougblln. who gave his Il
lustrated musical lecture on the "Music
of Mother Church." The vast subject was
treated In a concise and eloquent fashion
and the polished diction and pleasing
voice of the speaker added much to the
charm of the evening's entertainment.
Beginning with the ftlstory of all har
mony, when the "Gloria In Excelsls," the
song of the children of Israel, as they
hung their harps In the willows, and the
song of the morning star and the winds
and waves were* stiil with Godâ who is
Himself the spirit of harmonyâ the lect
urer brought the subject of sacred music
down to present day classical church har
monies. From the plain chant of St.
Gregory to the "Hosanna" of Jules Gra
nlcr, both of which Father McLoughlln
sang In highly sympathetic fashion, he
showed the gradual and Inevitable pro
gress. In quaint and simple fashion the
lecturer told of the fears entertained by
Pope and Cardinal of that strange and
wicked instrument, the organ, which was
first Introduced, in the church service in
the fourteenth century. And he asks:
"Were not their fears perhaps justified?"
as he told of latterday church music as
he had heard It In Boston, New York and
Philadelphia, where the speaker had
heard "Juanlta" masquerading as an
"Ave Maria." "O promise me that you
will take my hand" as a wedding hymn,
and kindred anachronisms, of which the
only logical conclusion was an "Annie
Rooney" and "Just Tell Them That You
Saw Me" anthem by the choir. For the
glory of God. "Gloria In Excelsls," not for
the glorification of composer, organist or
choir, Is the sacred hymn, and only music
written, played and sung in such spirit
can appeal to the highest in man. With
a plea for congregational singing and a
delightful reading of Cardinal Newman's
beautiful hymn, "Lead, Kindly Light,"
the lecture was concluded.

OAKLAND. March 8.â The Muni
cipal League added novelty to Its
campaign to-night by illustrating
its closing meeting with stereop
â¢ ticon views. The league held Its
meeting â¢ in the Tabernacle and the
speeches were Interlarded with cartoons,
pictures of candidates and written state
ments of the issues of the campaign.
Carey Howard, president of the Munici
pal League, called the meeting to order,
and after appealing to all present to sup
port the Municipal League ticket on
Monday next introduced Warren Olney
as chairman for the evening. Â¦,
"I understand the water question to be
the question of the campaign," said the
chairman. "I do not wish to be unjust
to the water company. I think It ought
to have a fair Income, but I believe the
people should rule the water company,
not that the water company should rule
the people, as It threatens to do."
Chairman Olney then began with the
head of the ticket and called upon all
the various candidates for short ad
dresses.
"We need good streets, we need a wa
ter front, we want more lights, but,
above all. we want pure water." said W.
G. Manuel, candidate for Mayor. "We
want water at a rate that â¢will be some
what reasonable to our taxpayers. The
Contra Costa Water Company gets an ex
orbitant rate of interest no,w on an In
flated valuation, and it is trying to estab
lish Its contentions by law. This city
could easily build a water works of Its
own for $2,000,000. For that sum it could
have everything to make the plant com
plete, including an elaborate distributing
system. Bonds could be Issued and In

fCEW YORK, March 8.â A Sun special
from London says: The Dally Expr.esd
declares that an alliance Is Imminent be
tween American trusts and great commer
cial syndicates in Germany. A member
of the Manhelm-Brem^n Petroleum Stocx
Company, one of the German agencies of
the Standard .OH Company, and J. -Plor
pont Morgan are. according to the paper,
the moving spirits in the plan. It says
that Morgan will meet representatives of
the leading German syndicates at a con
ference In Berlin in April. This confer
ence has already been .irranged by cable.
The Express prints a statement made by
an unnamed American â¢ millionaire, who,
it "ays has discussed a German-American
business union with the principals In both
countries. He savs: â¢ â¢
"We do not fear England In America,
nor Germany. V>'e simply fear each other,
but the world is big enough for both na
tions 'and the rival trusts are going to
harmonize their Interests. Morgan will be
here in April. After he begins It will not
be long before an International cartel to
regulate prices and' products 'will 'be
formed. We do not fear England, because
her machinery is obsolete and her men are
spiritless and ground to a low level by
false unionism. America and Germany
are going to stand together and dominate
the world's politics of business. I think
that one day the industries of the entire
world will be syndicated."

M. K. Miller. B. C. Cuvellier and othera
urged that the ticket be -voted from top

"The election of the Municipal League
ticket." said II. A. Powell, candidate for
School Director at large, "is a necessity.
The use of the name of a national party
in local politics is a detriment to the peo
ple of the city In which it Is used. It Is
a mistake to permit political managers to
thrust themselves into local affairs, where
our schools and people'3 Interests are con
cerned. What has 16 !.o 1 got to do with
this campaign so far as the water com
pany Is concerned? What has the consti
tution and the flag cot to do with our pur
chase of a municipal water works? How is
national party politics to assist the peo
ple of Oakland to fix water rates upon c
reasonable valuation? Any one who brings
his party In local affairs brings discord
and disunion into his city."
Felton Taylor, candidate for Treasurer,
eulogized his associates In the city gov
ernment.
George W. Dornln. candidate for Coun
cilman at largre. said that the course of
the water company in the courts and be
fore the Council furnished the people
with all the argument necessary for th'.s
campaign. He was not ordinarily opposed,
he said, to corporations, but he was op
posed to the Contra Costa Company for
Its conduct in this city. Water works in
private hands are a failure as compared
to the ownership of such necessities by
municipalities.

WARREN OLNEY, WUO PRESIDED AT THE NOVEL MEETING OF THE
MUNICIPAL LEAGUE AND DELIVERED A SHORT ADDRESS TO THE
VOTERS OF OAKLAND.
Joseph D. Redding, Jefferson E. Doollt
tle and E. A. Wiltsee are charged by the
Gold Run Gravel Company . (Limited), in a
complaint which will probably be filed in
the Superior Court to-day with having
mulcted the plaintll? out of $90,000. It Is
alleged In the complaint that ReddinÂ«
claimed to have paid $200,000 for the Gold
Run Consolidated Placer when in reality
be paid but $110,000, the defendants Do
little and Wiltsee sharing the difference
with him.
Reding as a director In the Gold Run
Company was authorized to make the
purchase. :
In May, 1S97, Redding came to California
for the purpose of completing the negoti
tions. It is charged that he entered Into
a conspiracy. with I>oolittle and Wiltsee to
defraud the company out of $90,000 and
that the terms of the conspiracy were
that Redding, In detfregard of his duty aa
agent, should falsely and fraudulently
represent to the company that the sum
actually paid for the property was $200,000.
Although the transaction took place in
18D7 the conspiracy according to the com
plaint was but recently discovered.
Mr.. Reddine. whose home Is in New
Yock, 13 In the city and declares there Is
no truth In the charges. He says:
"The only correct statement is that the
company bought the property and got a
good bargain. There \rasÂ» no conspiracy.
The money was paid by checks and passed
through the banks In the regular course
of business. No conspiracy could have
been carried through under such condi
tions.
"Doolittle and Wiltsee were part owners
In the property and joined In making the
sale. Everything in the transaction was
clean, open and aboveboard.
Colonel Doolittle declares the suit ia
simply a piece o{ spite work.
"It is four years since the sale Â¦was
made," said he last night, "and this is the
first complaint I have heard. No demand
has been made against me. and this suit
comes as a surprise. I got the property
together. Wiltsee took the bond on It and
Redding placed it on the market.
"Wiltsee and I got one-tenth of the
shares of the new company, which we di
vided. I also owned an interest in one of
the claims and got my pro rata for that.
The full amount of Â£40.000 was paid out."

reached her gate when she was seized,
carried to a nearby vacant lot and bru

her assailant as a roughly dressed negro

were smeared with coal dust, grease or

Tell a Thrilling Story of
Perils Undergone by
British Ship.
ASTORIA, March 8.â One of the most
thrilling stories of the sea, which havf*
been told. in this port in recent years. N
related by the men of the British ship
County of Linllthgrow, which reached
Astoria last night from. Kobe, Japan. For
more than seventy-two hours the vessel
lay on her bean ends, her spars burrted
in the sea. The captain and first officer.
the men assert, were speechless with ter
ror and upon the second mate, a youn.?
man of 26, devolved the task of saving th.Â«
ship and the twenty men aboard. ThÂ»
men charge that Captain Stoark was In
toxicated when the disaster overtook thd
vessel, and six of them to-day left tha
ship, refusing to go to sea again with tha
skipper.
The story of the LJnlithgow'a tercibla
experience was told to Itie Call correa
pondent this evening by John Klebe, one
of the deserters. Klebe Is 43 years of age.
but Is still strong and vigorous and his
honest countenance left no doubt as to h'Â»
sincerity. His story follows:
Trouble Soon Begins.
We sailed f rim 2(ew " York for Kobe with
a cargo of oil and \%ere five months in making
the voyajfe. On the trip Captain Stoark dis
played woeful lack of seamanship and we loÂ»t
considerable canvas. The board9 which were
reed to hold the cargo " in place were sold .
to Japanese for firewood and when we came to
take on ballast we had practically no shit tin*
beards. The ballast was coarse sand, which
shifted easily, and forty-eight hours after !eav.
ing port our troubles commenced.
It was midnight on February 2 when all
hands were called on deck. A storm was
blowing, but the wind was not high enough
to cause the least bit of alarm aboard a well
regulated Vessel. The main lower topsail had
carried away and the captain became Â»o dis
cc ncerted that he ordered the fore lower top
pail and mlzzen lower topsail cut loose. When
hi gave orders to heave th^ vessel to she would
trough of th â¢ sea. The ballast shifted and
the ihip went over on to her beam ends.
The men were forward ar the time, but
cravled aft for or>lÂ«-rÂ». They found the cap
tain in an Intoxicated condition and the first
officer so badly rattled that he could not fflvw
orders. The second mate was calm and in
structed us to go below. We could not it*t
down through the main hatch, but Vent
through the lazarette. The ballast was f.y-
Ing to starboard and the ship was golr.Â« fur
ther over every minute. Six of us went tnti>
the hold. We flm tore off the 'tween deck,
hatches, and u?lnp them as shifting boards,
began righting ballast.
No Best for the men.
Then followed the worst seventy-two hours I
ever experienced. The men worked night and
day, resting a few hours in every twenty-four.
The captain did not show up till the second
day. and even then did not want us to floor out
ballast, paying the vessel would be sunk so low
she would roll her ma.<ts out. Finally, how
ever, he consented to Oils, and we got the ship
en an even keel araln.
A fortnight later another storm came up. TTw
captain araln became rattled and ordered all
Â¦all In. Under bare poles the vessel was at tha
mercy of the seas and rolled about In a trough.
Fortunately the ballast held, else the ship
would have capsized.
During the first storm the men had only water
and* biscuits, and when we finally demanded,
food of s the captain he sent up a six-pound tia
of beef for sixteen men.
Klebe charges that on the second day
of the first storm he came on deck ani
found the captain hanging over tha
weather rail on the poop deck In a drunk
en stupor. He says he is utterly incap
able of handling the vessel and the men
fear he will drown them If they remain
aboard. Six of the crew will libel the ves
sel for wages.

ance of the Peace.
SOFIA, March 8.â Increasing apprehen
sion is felt in Bulgaria at the concentra
tion of Turkish troops on the Macedonian
frontier. It Is known that large quanti
ties of arms, and ammunition have been
secretly imported Into Kossovo, Uskuv
ami Monastir.
Two Russian officers who have toured
recently In Xorthern Macedonia left last
night for St. Petersburg. The Bulgarian
Government has received sharp reminders
from three of the great powers that it will
be held responsible for the preservation of
order In the border districts. Great anx
iety exists In Albania, which la in a state
of unusual ferment.
Two Hundred Infantrymen Stir Up
the Town of Highwood and
Clean Out Saloons.
CHICAGO, March 8.â Two hundred sol
diers of the Fifth Infantry^ stationed at
Port Sheridan, created a panic last -night
in' the little town of Highwood. which
adjoins the fort. The soldiers were on
leave and after visiting the saloons many
of them became drunk and lights were
numerous.
Frank Hughey, a private of Company
F, was terribly beaten in one of the
fights and is now in a serious condition.
Two saloons were wrecked and the resi
dents of the village were compelled to
keep off the streets. The Highwood au
thorities were unable to cope with the
soldiers. There was no trouble to-day or
to-night, however.

STOCKTON. March 8.â H. J. Severns
of Modesto this evening stabbed hia wife
with a pocketknlfe at the Alta lodging
house. The blade narrowly missed the
jugular vein. He was slightly intoxi
cated and on joining his wife this after
noon he charged her with infidelity.
After the stabbing he was arrested and
it was found that his own neck had been
cut, but the long gashes had not struck
a vital spot. He refused to tell how the
wound was inflicted. Last May he wound
ed his wife with a shotgun in Modesto,
but claimed it was an accident. He was
not prosecuted for that shooting. Â¦ _ .

publications. Bailey it- a Theta Delta Chi
man and a prominent athlete. He is from
San Diego. Cook :s a graduate of the
Lowell High School, San Francisco.
Even down In thÂ«Â» freshman class th".
Influence of the women has been felt.
That class Â¦was trying to make arrange
ments for Bourdon to-day. The male
members wanted something startling to
happen on that dayâ something to be re
membered and where the chances of
punchirs a pnphnnwri 's face were excel
lent. T!iÂ«? all-pervatiir.fc Influence of the
co-eds oppressed their plans until a mlid
rr.ajinficd freshman named R. Phillips
humbly suggested tiiat the festivitit-s of
Â¦the day consist of \Â». pink tea and that
invitations be extended to the members
cf the faculty an<1 their wives." This bit
of ircr.y roused the lighting spirit of the
men and they have Â¦ flered a reward for
any one who can think of something real
wicked for them n do on Bourdon an.l
yet not get them cupelled trr.xn coilege.
Committees on Bour.ion and Charter day
hostilities will be appointed.
The men to relieve their feelings heM
an extra session after the co-eds had gone
their way. They declJfd to hold a Bniokt-r
âa *'m-co- <> ds-admitted-senior-men-only

Fmoke up and have a time without fem
tr.ir.e interference. President Butler was

will name the date and place. for the
hmoker and make the necessary arrange
ments.

The spirit of rebellion was first shown
to-day :n the senior class meeting. Plans
were being made for class day exercises.
Several of the j oung iadies arose and
a*=ked for reformation in the matter of
the class day extravaganza. They wanted
more refinement in the open-air class day
play. They said that the humor of plays
that have gone before was as rough as
sandpaper, and that the jokes, evolved
from masculine brains' on faculty and stu
dents, were just too awful. They inti
mated that co-eds costumed in Chinese
parb or senior men in the summer carb
of the Aztec or the airy raiment of the
Roman senator were not beautiful or ele
vating eights when gamboling over the
grrer. of the Berkeley campus.
Promptly at the close of the co-eds'
*peÂ«ches a half-dozen senior men were on
their feet. They warned to know what
â¢was the matter with a joke'with a nub;
they wanted to know *\hat was the mat
ter with the good old-fashioned times pre
oeding classes had had in graduation: and
â¢what they particularly wanted to know
was, were the co-eds running the college.
and if go wer.Â» they- poing to do a^\ay
with the rollicking things of the pan and
introduce funeral processions and Sunday
school picnics. A compromise was finally
effected. It was left for President John
\V. S. Butler to appoint the class day c m
mittees. and the person! he selects, will
â¢<!ecidÂ» the character of the extravaganza.
President Butlvr is not fÂ«*clinp altogether
comfortable in his position. He will not
appoint the committees until next week,
after he has had a chance for a good long
think.
The constantly Incseasing number of

then the men feel what it is to have the
strong ruling arm of the co-ed around
their necks, metaphorically, of course,
and they den't like it.
BERKELEY. March S.-The men of the
University of California broke out in open
rebellion to-day against co-ed rule. They
asserted that ihe good old-time rush, the
frolicsome class day and the spectacular
and epg-tx-sprhikied Bourdon have degen
erated Into cusnion tÂ«is, ladies' dajs and
other dregs suit functions, highly er.er
vatir.Â£ to college spirit and pocketbook.
All of this has happened, they declare,
on account of the usurpation of man's
rig-ht to rule by the ekirt-wearlng Etu

SAN JOSE PLANNING
FOR A CELEBRATION
Heal Estate Boom Expected to Follow
the Opening of the Coast
Hail-way.
SAN JOSE, March 8.â A movement has
been Instituted by a number of business
men looking to a celebration In this city
In honor of the arrival of the ilrst train
over the new coast road. The sentiment
Is unanimous, and the Improvement Club
will take the matter up and make ar
rangements. The first train Â¦will arrive
hero on Sunday, and It is proposed to hold
the celebration the next day. Speech
making and a general jollification have
been suggested.
A remarkable change has come over
the conditions of the local real estate
market in the past sixty days, and a
email boom is expected when the trains
of the coast road commence r&nning-. N'oc
in seven years has there been such a de
mand for real estate by buyers, and rent
able , property Is almost unobtainable.
Many sales have lately been made and
inquiries are numerous. The bulk of the
transactions Is in city realty and income
paying property. Although there is some
demand for orchard property, moat of
those Investing in outside property take
unimproved lands. Real estate agents
are preparing for what they believe will
be a rush when the coast trains are run
ning. \

Special Dispatch to The Call,
VALLEJO, March 8.â Miles Sears was
found at 2:30 o'clock this morning wander-
Ing along Georgia street with a lar^e
wound in his left breast from which blood
was flowing copiously. Officer Williams
took him to Dr. Bond, who found a ball
from a 32-caliber revolver lodged in the
muscles of Sears' back. The bullet had
entered two and a half inches above the
heart, inflicting a dangerous wound. After
extracting the bullet and taking from the
wound a piece of cloth which had been
carried in by the lead. Dr. Bond sent
Sears to the receiving 1 ship Independence,
to Â¦which he is attached
Sears, who is an acting boatswain In
the navy, accuses his mother-in-law. Mrr.
Sheehan, of Vallejo, of having shot him.
Mrs. Sheehan disclaims all knowledge of
the affair. It is said Sears has had vari
ous quarrels of late with his wife's family
and he is known to possess an Irritable
disposition. -
The general belief is that Sears' wouPv!
was self-inflicted. Sears was under tlie
Influence of liquor. He had applied lor
leave of absence from the Independence,
.which was refused by tho captain of that
ship. Sears then manufactured a storv to
the. effect that the commandant of the
navy yard had given him permission to go
to Vallejo and told it to the executive offi
cer after the captain had left the sh'.u.
The dodge worked and Sears obtained
permission to leave the vessel. ,"
While in "Vallejo Sears occupies a room
at the Hollman House. The other room
ers say they heard no shot*, but a 32
caliber revolver was found In the room
he occupied and it is with this weaDor
he Is supposed to have inflicted the wound
which may cause his death.
Sears got his appointment recently and
has not yet received his warrant. Th'i
affair may cost him his chances in the
r.avy if not his life.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSH. March 8.â Because thÂ»
Healtn Inspector had insisted that he
keep the cowyard clean John Murphy, a
dairyman, became despondent and killed
himself this morning. Murphy took dras
tic measures and precautions to make
death certain. First he drank a pint of
wood alcohol and then he cut his throat
from oar to ear with a razor. The Jugu
lar vein was severed and he bled to death.
Murphy was 23 years of age and resided
with his parents at 707 South Ninth street.
He conducted a Bmall dairy at Fifth and
Margaret streets and had a milk route.
The dairy was sosrjjy and filthy and
Health Inspector Connor ordered him to
clean It. Murphy delayed action and the
health authorities threatened his arrest.
This led to his despondency.
Murphy's relatives called him at 1
o'clock this morning and he arose and
went to the barn to milk his cows. Ho
did not appear at breakfast time and a
younger brother was sent to learn the
cause. Murphy's body wa% found lyinjr
in a pool of blood In a shed. Beside him
was an empty bottle that had contained
the alcohol and beneath his blood-stained
hand lay an open razor.
Some 'of the cows had been milked and
the milk strained. In the mltlit of his
labors he had stepped aside to kill him
self.

Rabbi Voorsanger said that in this age
of progress It was only the minority of
people who delved to any depth in ancient
literature, the great majority seemingly
being content to study it from the sur
face. The history of the New Testament
cannot be studied without research tnto
its source, and that source is the marvel
ous Talmud. <' >"â¢
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger told his con
gregation last night of the Talmud. His
lecture tended to show'that the book of
Israel was not only a book of laws but a
book containing the ideas of the fathers
of Israel gathered during a period of 1000
years.
The rabbi, continuing, said that the his
tory of thirty generations was comprised
in the book. It was written without sys
tel J?.'. ?: nd if the methods of the modern
publisher were used it would make a
library of more than 100 volumes. The
glory belongs to Israel that It has pre
se Â£X ed v. ,. Uterature for ten centuries,
while the literature of others was allowed
to sink into the gloom of ignorance

abroad for further study. He spent seven
months in the National School of Design
and then sailed for Paris. He became a
private pupil of Paul Chopin, a gold med
allist at the Salon and. like Mr. Tilden, a
deaf mute. After five months' study with
him Mr. Tilden felt able to work inde
pendently. In all he had thirteen months*
Instruction in his art. He spent seven
years In Paris, studying the history of
sculpture sjnd the methods of its masters..
The first work he sent to the Salon was
accepted. This was the statue known as
the "Baseball Player," familiar to all vis
itors to Golden GatÂ»5 Park.
In 1889 the scurotor exhibited at thÂ«
Salon the bronze of "The Baseball Play
er" and a Blaster cast of "The Tired
.Boxer. The latter, which now graces
the vestibule of the Olympic Club, when
exhibited in bronze in 1830 gained the cov
eted "mention honorable" at the Salon
In 1S91 he exhibited "The Young Acrobat."
In 1S92 a much more ambitious work was
exhibited at the Salon. This is the largo
group known as "The Bear Hunt," rep
resenting an Indian in the clutch of. a
grizzly. This work, whiph is now on the
grounds of the Institute for the Deaf
Dumb and the Blind at Berkeley, won the
sculptor the honor of an appointment on
the Jury at tho Columbian Exposition.
He exhibited again In 1S03 in the Salon.
This time he was represented by "Tho
I-ootball Players." This was offered as a
prize for a series of games between elev
ens representing Stanford University and
the University of California. It was won
by the latter players and now graces ttie
campus at Berkeley. In 1S34 Mr. Tilden re
turned to this city. He was made un in
structor in modeling at the Mark Hopkln*
Institute of Art. a position he still holds"
The two works which will perpetuate
the memory of Mr. Tilden are the Native
Sons monument on Market street, oppo
site.Mason, and the Donahue fountain,
now In course of construction on Market
street, opposite First. The former is com
memorative of the admission of Califor
nia as a State and was dedicated to the
Native Sons. The Donahue memorial
fountain was provided for bv James Mer
vyn Donahue, son of Peter Donahue, pio
neer ship and railroad builder. He left a
bequest of $25,000 for the purpose of ereci
lng the memorial. The amount of h'i
work is not large, but his friends and ad
mirers have predicted that some day ho
would win world-wide fame.

Douglt-s TiWcn is one of the famous
sculptors of California. He was born at
Chico. May 1, 1S50. An attack of scarlet
fever at the age of 5 left him incurably
deaf and dumb. He was sent to
the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb
and the Blind at Berkeley and re
mained there until his graduation
in 1Â£79. He entered the University of
California in the class of 1S83. A vacancy
occurring In the faculty of thtÂ» institute,
he gave up a collegiate education to ac
cept a position as teacher. It was In his
twenty-third vear he discovered, almost
by accident. In which direction his talents
lay. He saw rome modeling in clay by
his brother, and it made a strong impres
sion on him. At the time his brother was
under the Instruction of Marion Wells,
and he joined his class. He learned the
technique of the art with such rapidity
that at the end of a month he was able
to work alone. He continued at the in
stitute for four years longer, spending all
his leisure in modeling. In 1SS5 he pro
duced what he considers his first work, a
small statuette entitled the "Tired Wrest
ler."
The family of the gifted sculptor are
grief-stricken over the fate that has
overtaken him. The suddenness of the fit
of wildness prostrated them, as Mr. Til
den had been In the enjoyment of perfect
health and his behavior gave no inkling
that his mind was giving way. He was

In view of the very explicit limitations placed
upon the tax rate by the charter and because
of the further fact that it does not appear to
me to be mandatory that the entire debt
should be canceled In one year I am unwilling
to advlre that a tax levy In which you should
provide for such claim* outside of the dollar
limit would be valid aj to such excess. The
amendment in my opinion Is self-executing
and requires no legislative action to give it
effect.
The City Attorney filed an opinion with
the Supervisors' Finance Committee yes
terday in response to a number of ques
tions relating to the proposed payment of
unpaid claims accruing: in past fiscal
years. The important features of the
opinion are that It will not be necessary
for the claimholders to obtain judgments
against the city, and that the surplus
fund will be available to pay the back
claims on July 1, 1901. The opinion says:
The constitutional nrr.endment empowers the
city to meet obligations which In fact It had
never repudiated, but which it found itself
unable to satisfy by reason of the Inhibition
of tho constitution. In this view of the law
therefore 1 do not think It necessary that such
claims i-hould be prosecuted to Judgment be
fore they can be paid. If in July. 1S93, it had
been legal for the city t^nd county out of the
fiscal revenue? of the year 1833-4 to pay 1SD2-3
claims it certainly would not have been re
quired that such claim3 should have been put
into judgments against ths city and county
before payment.
The only proceeding now necessary to carry
out the Intention to pay valid, approved claims
is to provide funds out of which they can be
paid and authorize their payment by ordinance.
There should be direct and positive action
showing the determlnr.non of the city to pay
these claims and the appropriation of funds to
this purpose.
The city hes power to pay with Interest at
5 per cent per annum; for there Is no power
to pay otherwise. Tha people evidently re
garded the holders of these claims as entitled
to Interest, but at a rate less than the usual
legal rate. My construction of this amend
ment, however, does not require that these
claims shall be paid ouc of the funds of any
one year. They may be paid at any time out
of the Income and revenue of "any year or
years" succeeding the years when the debts
were incurred. All mat is required to make
the surplus available for payment of these
claims Is that It be carried over Into next
year's revenues, after all proper obligations
against it have been discharged and appro
priated in the budget for the purpose of pay
ing these back claims. And thus this money
which upon the 30th day I of June, 1901. the
last day of the present fiscal year, would not
be available to pay these claims would be
available for such use upon the 1st day of
July, 1S01, the first day of the next fiscal year.
Interest Shall Be Paid Thereon and
Tax Bate Must Be Kept
Within the Bollar
Limit.
