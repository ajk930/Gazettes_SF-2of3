Near the village. of Salshufu a meeting
was held on May -16. While this meeting
was in progress two French missionaries
suddenly appeared at the head of a band
of 300 converts, who were armed with
rifles and guns. The converts - at once
opened, fire on the assembled natives,. who
fled in disorder. One native was wounded
and Go Daijen, a leader {of the natives,'
and five others we're ' carried away by the
attacking party. . 'Â¦Â¦ Â¦â¢'-Â¦Â¦-

VICTORIA. 1J. C. June 25.â The steamer
Kamakuta Maru, the new COOO-ton vetsel
added to the Nippon Yusen Kalsba line,
brought full details on her arrival Â¦ to
night of the recent massacre of more than
three hundred French converts. In
Korea. It seems from the reports
received by Japanese papers from
their correspondents at Seoul that the
1 fault lies with the converts and two
French missionaries, they having attack
ed the natives.
The MainchI, a Tokio paper, publishes
a minute report of the Governor of Quel
part, dated at Quelpart on June 20.- In
this report the official says that revenue
cfllcers during the past few years have
been In the habit of levying heavy taxes
The ccr.vtrts then marched on into the
village of Salshufu, invading it and Â¦ car-^
rying away a number of flags and much
ammunition, as well as despoiling consid
erable property. They took possession of
the ; place, and, closing thej gates, .fired
from the walls upon a party of natives
who were returning to the village, .killing
one and injuring three. others very badly.
.This act on. the part of the two mission
aries and I their converts ': so enraged Vthe
natives that they massed in large numbers
arid drove the converts from ; the 'Seized
village', killing eight converts and forcing
them. to release the six men who had been
arrested.. When the Christians "saw, that

Protection's Signal Triumph.
. The platform sets forth that the prin
ciple of protection has achieved its most
signal triumph in the results of the Ding-
_ "The Republican party, by its magnfl
cent achievements, has added luster to
American history, and under its adminis
tration of national affairs the United
States has become a world power of tha
first class. Industry has revived. Capi
tal and labor are employed, plenty has
succeeded want and the cry of the hun
gry and unemployed Is no longer heard,
but from every quarter comes the de
mand for workmen at the highest wages
ever. paid to American labor. Our export
trade has increased until it leads the
world, approximating for the present
year $1,500,000,000. ' The Republican party,
by/ its monetary legislation, has estab
lished the gold standard, thereby remov
ing the menace of an inflated currency
and its attendant repudiation of its finan
cial obligations, private and public, and
has raised our credit above that 'of any
other nation. A Republican Congress has
relieved the people by a reduction in di
rect taxation approximating $40,000,000 and
our national treasury shows that a grow
ing surplus has succeeded an increasing
deficit.".
â¢The platform . reaffirms tho principles
set forth by the last national Republican
conventions, and continues: ..
General Charles H. Grosvenor presented
the report of the committee on resolu
tions, which was adopted.
"We ar,e in favor of a reciprocity to ex
pand our trade in foreign countries, but
underlying that must be a condition that
makes it purely a reciprocity, not for the
sake of encouraging any nation in closer
commercial relations with a profit on ona
side." ,â-;,â¢ /
Platform Is Presented.
"If I had time to discuss the economic
questions, at .issue I would simply say
stand by. cur record upon the tariff ques
tion. We stand by that* principle which
has built up this magnificent country and
our great industries, and we will not per
mit an abridgment of It that will Inter

PROCEEDINGS IN CONVENTION
Hanna's - Speech and the Platform
Think Slate Is Broken.
It had been currently reported. that Crew
and Critchfleld were on the Hanna slate
for these two nominations,; but' Senator Â¦
Hanna vigorously denied taking any par t " ;
whatever in the contests; for those two':
places. 'Judge Crew is an old; friend. and-,
neighbor of. Elmer C. Dover, the private V
secretary of Senator Hanna.. Dover. was. *
working at the Crew headquarters. Many .
therefore claimed that Dover's operations
had the sanction of , the Senator/and that/
the slate was broken. The vote . showed ; Â£
that Price and Emerson' had formed 1 a '
combination that worked successfully for â;
both of them. Judge Price of. Lima- has'
been on the Common Pleas and Circuit
benches and Emerson has been promi
nent-in politics In Eastern Ohio for many;
years. ,- : - -Â¦Â¦/.ââ¢ Â¦Â¦"Â¦'"'Â¦ "l\\ ''Â¦
The nomination that caused .the most'
comment was that of Nippert 'in- place of
Lieutenant Governor Caldwell, .the latter
being' the only 'one who was elected with"
Governor. Nash two years ago that was '
not denominated for a second term. . The .
State Anti-Saloon League caused Caldwell r
to run "several thousand behind his ticket^
in' 1893 and : had : vigorously Opposed his
nomination."' .' ~
Hanna Prevents Demonstration.
There were frequent calls for Caldwell
in the convention, but. he. could, not .
induced to take the platform or. even rise
In his seat, ' and Chairman Hanna dis-^
patched business . in' such', a way .as to '
give no opportunity/ for demonstrations. '
When'the delegates were calling for Cald
well;-Chairman Hanna made Caldwell a
member of the committee to escort . Gov- l
ernor Nash to the ' hall to deliver his '
speech of acceptance, and while this J
committee " was out Chairman Hanna ?
promptly called up the next order of ; '
business and State Senator.., Nippert was <
nominated.' Nippert had -been principal '
of schools i at CInclhnaf i and Police | Pros- '
ecutor there. 'Like Caldwell, he Is liberal,
and the State "Anti-Saloon League has ex-' '
pressed its displeasure ' because. Nippert'. '
in' the last Legislature voted against the â¢
â¢ Clark': lojcal option bill. On the other hand, 1
the representatives of the liquor interests ; 
were very much displeased over what â¢
theyi." term /â¢ the enforced* retirement 'of \
Caldwell,, while Rev. Mr. Clark has' been ,
rehomlnaited- in . Columb'us , f or the .Legis- ;
lature. and several . Republican ; members .
who opposed the Clark ' local option bill { ,
have been defeated. for. renomination. : .
and Chairman ; Hanna not only . cut short - Â¦
his own speech^ but : also those , of others
arid then dispatched business with the
utmost speed.- -In those .three, hours the
convention nominated a. . full. State ticket, y
adopted 'its; declaration'- of principles; in- ,
dorsed'-. J. ' B/iFomker -as- .tho' â¢Republican ;<

: Of the seven '-. nominations ' only three "_
were new men and one of these, Nippert Â¦
for Lieutenant Governor, was nominated '
without opposition after Lieutenant Gov- -
ernor Caldwell had declined renomination. '
Nash, Sheets, Cameron and Johnson were
renominated for second terms without op- -
position.'- There were free for all contests \
for the nominations for Supreme Judge
and Clerk of the Supreme Court..
Considine coolly i handed , his smoking
weapon to Sheriff Cudihee and gave him
self up. The Sheriff and Lane arrested
Thomas Considine Â»and both prisoners
were hurried away to the County Jail.
The Coroner. was summoned and removed
Meredith's .body to the Morgue. ' In the
dead man's clothing were found the small
revolver and a small dirk knife. An In
quest will be held to-morrow.
The second shot which Meredith fired at
Considine was the only one which took
effect. The charge tore Considine's hat to
shreds and. one of the buckshot lodged in
the base of- his ' } skull. .Considine's. neck
and head were badly powder burned. ' His
wounds, however, are not serious. -â¢
For a time after the tragedy, there were
angry threats of a lynching. The thou
sands who hurried to the scene, lacking
full particulars of the affair, supposed
that the ex-Chief had been set unon by
the Considine's and " murdered. As :the
facts became known public anger sub
sided. ';"'
Have Long Been Foes. v
Considine and Meredith had been mortal
enemies for about three years, although
they were prior to that time . warm per
sonal friends arid associated i together in
the theatrical business in Spokane. Mere
dith, Vho resigned his office last, Saturday
on account of pressure brought to bear
upon him by Mayor Humes, was a -city
detective before being made chief. While
in ; the ' subordinate position - he and Con
sidine never, spoke, but avoided open ;bat
tle.VAfter Meredith was made chief, how
ever, : he served notice on Considine that
the latter could hot remain in ' the city
and do business, and.; followed up the
threat by making , several ; police orders
which affected" Considine's business.'- Â¦' -
In retaliation,' Considine ' publicly made
.charges of corruption in office against
Meredith, and reiterated/ them until the
Law and Order League took up the mat
ter."arid called for a Council, Investigation
of the police department. A Council com
mittee . investigated and last : Friday night
made a' report to ; Mayor Humes, advising
the * removal of Meredith '. and one of :hls
detectives",: C. . W. Wappenstein: Mayor
Humes ..requested \ Meredith's
resignation.;^./ -'Â¦Â¦ . â¢..- ./.;-Â¦ rv 'â¢'Â¦-'â¢Â¦/
Â¦./Â¦ it'.' was* believed I by 'Â¦ the friends of Iboth
men" that , a t shooting; would ; follow, Mere-
Talk of a Lynching.
Then Considine' and Meredith' engaged
in a desperate struggle for the" revolver.'
Tom finally wrenched it from Meredith's
grasp and repeatedly beat the ex-Chief
over the head with it. -Sheriff Cudlhee,
Police Detective A." G. Lane and several
other police officers, who had Â¦ been
standing on the opposite side of the
street, rushed into the drug store and at
tempted to separate. the combatants. The
Sheriff flung Tom Considine aside and ob
tained possession of the revolver.. Lane
caught John Considine and held him fast.
Meredith, half-stunned by the blows he
had received, reeled against a showcase
and made a feeble movement as though
to draw, another and smaller pistol from
his pocket. At this juncture John Consi
dine tore himself away from Lane, and,
drawing his - own revolver, fired three
shots in quick succession at his antag
onist at a distance of eight feet. Mere
dith reeled and" fell dead, his body pierced
by three bullets.
Considine found himself^ cornered on
reaching 'the "rear 'of the store, and turn
ing, grappled; with : his enemy..-; .Thomas
Considine. the gambler's brother,' who had.
been standing ysvith him iuj. front -of rthe
store," had : followed Meredith"; aricThe'"a.lso"
grappled with him. Mefford aided In j the
attempt-to disarm Meredith.
Aid Comes to Considine.
He found Considine in front, of the drug
store shaking hands with'a friend, Police
man A. H. Mefford. , Thrusting the barrel
of the gun over Mefford's shoulder, he
discharged the weapon full in' Considine's
face. The paper wrapping prevented his
taking accurate aim and the charge went
wild. ; Considine ran into: the store and
Meredith followed, discharging the second
barrel -just as he entered 1 the door.' Then
Meredith dropped the gun, and, drawing
liis heavy revolver, continued; the pursuit.
_. Meredith was the' aggressor and made a
deliberate attempt to" assassinate his per
sonal and political enemy".-. He spent the
afternoon in . walking about, the. streets,
armed with a "sawed-off" double-barreled
shotgun loaded with buckshot, in search
of his man. In order to avert suspicion
he had wrapped the weapon In > a large
sheet of butcher's paper .and tied it. with
a cord so that it bore little resemblance to
an instrument of death. â¢
â¢ SEATTLE, June 25.â John W.' Considine,
one of the proprietors of the Standard
gambling-house and the People's Theater
in ' this . city, shot and killed Â¦/ex-Chief of
Police W.T. Meredith at 5:30* o'clock this
afternoon. The shooting occurred in Guy's
drug store, at the corner of Second ave

Nebraskan Beplies to Senator For-

WATERTOWN, N. Y., June 25.â In an
interview W. J.; Bryan said that Senator
Hanna was the logical candidate of the
Republican party for President in 1904,
because he represents the dominant force
In that party. Vice President Roosevelt,
he said, represented "the warlike spirit
which was developed by a war of con
quest." In reply to Senator For&ker's
speech at Columbus, Ohio, last night
Bryan said:
"When Senator Foraker says that I am
the only intelligent man who does not
admit that the defeat of 1896 was a bless
ing to the country he makes an unjust
reflection upon the intelligence of more
than 8,000,000 Â¦ people, for there are that
many who do not believe that a Demo
cratic victory in 1S96 would have brought
disaster to the nation, and they are suffi
ciently intelligent to deserve the respect
of Senator Foraker."

had read extracts from a paper written

the war had proved that military service
as practiced to-day Is absurd and decisive
war is impossible.
"Wars will be fought out by. decisive
battles as formerly," said General Miles,
"though field operations will be more ex
tensive. In order to successfully, prose

with Spain demonstrated that decisive

the loss of life at about fifty, a greater
part of whom were colored miners and
their families.' A great many more are
missing and are supposed to have been
swept away. There are great piles of de

not taking into consideration the delay to
traffic, etc. Their double track is prac

miles and at least 3500 men are at â¢ work
day and night repairing the roadbed and
removing drift. It will be four days be
fore any traffic can be moved, but the loss
to the company will reach about $400,000.
The property lost by private parties is
very heavy and may reach the million
dollar mark. The wires are deluged with
press matter and hundreds of messages
are received hourly frorn anxious friends
in all parts of the united States Inquiring
about relatives and. friends. Until traffic

in the international pigeon shoot which

The alleged reason for tne present refusal
Is that Money does not belong to any club

Cleveland.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 25.â In a
grave on a hill' that overlooks the city, in
Lakeview Cemetery, the body of Adelbert
Stone Hay was laid to rest this afternoon.
The , funeral party arrived , in Cleveland
from New Haven at noon and the funeral
services were, held in the Wade mortuary
chapel a few hours later. Accompanying
the remains were the parents of the de
ceased, Secretary of State John Hay and
Mrs. Hay; Helen. Alice and Clarence Hay,
their children; Mr. and Mrs. J. H. "Wade
and Samuel Mather, relatives. Harry
Payne Whitney, Mr. Hltt, Mr. Wadsworth
and Mr. .Hale, classmates of Adelbert, ac
companied the body as representatives of
Yale College.
The casket rested on a white marble
catafalque ia the center of the new mor
tuary chapel. It was covered with flow
ers. A wreath of roses was the gift of the
State Department at Washington.
Yale classmates of the deceased were
the honorary pall-bearers. Mrs. Hay waa
so nearly prostrated that her husband had
to assist her nearly all the time. The re

by a quartet. The Rev. Hiram Hayden,
tho venerable pastor of Old Stone Presby

Poolrooms in Butte Are Closed.
BUTTE, Mont., June, 25.â All the pool
rooms in Butte closed down at the end of
business to-day, Mayor Davy having or
dered their licenses revoked. The rooms
have been paying the city $150 a month
each. They claim that they were ordered
to do so, and, further, there is no pro
hibition against their business in the anti
gambling law. The Mayor takes the
ground that there is no law permitting
poolrooms. It is claimed the closing of
the rooms was brought about by the
gamblers who were not allowed to â¢ run
their business and who agitated the doc
trine of "all or none."

by United States District Attorney Rogers
at Helena to set aside patents for 10,000
acres of valuable land in Missoula Coun
ty, alleged to have been filed on for specu
lative purposes, Senator TV. A. Clark said
to-day:
"I' was an innocent purchaser of these
lands for a valuable consideration and I
maintain the Government cannot cancel
the titles nor interfere ' with my rights.
That doctrine was clearly established In
the case of the United States vs. Budd."
: You ask me what the friends of civil service
reform In the States can do, and all I can say
is that you will strengthen us, I think, by hav
ing the fact generally understood that the law
has never been suspended since it was passed,
and that no attempt has been made to evade
its provisions.
I desire to add that in our civil service law
and in carrying it out to the letter we have the
assistance, both sincere and active, of the
President and the Secretary of War. . We have
not been obliged to make a single appointment
'at the request of the Secretary or .the Presi
dent. They have assisted us when we called
on . them for advice, but that is all, and they
have had us understand that they were in
sympathy with our purpose in making the law
effective., As It Is, we have not heard of any
complaint of It from any 6ource. As an earnest
of the sincerity with which the law was. put
into effect. I should like to call your attention
to the fact that every man who was appointed
between the first week of September, when the
law was passed, and the 1st of March, when the
machinery was all ready for operation, was re
quired to pass a competitive examination unless
he had been a volunteer soldier, and that 700
applicants took the first examination, a very
large proportion of whom were temporary ap
pointees. It was suggested and urged that we
ought not require such appointees to pass a
competitive examination, but we were firm, and
as a result a great many worthless appointees
abandoned the Idea of taking the examination
and went home.

THE REQUISITE
EL. PASO, Tex., June 25.â A fight is now
on near Deming, N. M., between the
Bouthern Pacific and Bisbee railroads.
The Bisbee Railway people have declared
their intention of crossing the Southern
Pacific tracks " at that point to connect
â¢with the Santa Fe, and the Southern Pa
'cific has stationed armed guards and has
built a fence along its right of way to
prevent the 'Bisbee from carrying out its
determination.
The Bisbee grade Is complete to within
a. hundred feet of the Southern Pacific
track, but as often as the contractors and
workmen of the new railway have en
deavored to extend the line across ' the
Bouthern Pacific the four armed guards
have interfered and ordered the employes
of the new company to clear out or take
the consequences. Guards are on duty
day and night and have been stationed
there two weeks, or ever since the pur
pose of the Bisbee became known. The
Bisbee people have eighteen teams and a
large force of men engaged in grading
find have made a number of ineffectual
attempts to cross the Southern Pacific,
but the guards have on each occasion re
pulsed them.
The Bisbee grade comes up from the
southwest and approaches the Southern
Pacific at a point about one mile west of
Deming. The company's intention is to
cross over and connect with the Santa
Ke and the latter's roundhouse and use
the Santa Fe tracks into El Paso until
its own tracks have been laid. A few
days ago the Southern Pacific people,
fearing that guards might prove ineffec
tual in preventing the laying of the Bis
bee tracks across its own, ordered that
fences be constructed along its right of
xvay. A fence one mile and a half long
ie now being built. Just how the trouble
will end can only be surmised, but it is
said that it will likely be settled among
officials who are now considering the
crossing Question.

CHICAGO, June 23.â Xhrringr a heavy
thunder storm to-night a bolt of lightning
struck the College of Physicians and Sur
geons, on Harrison street, between "Wood
and Honore. The flre which followed the
lightning in a short time destroyed the
college building, which was one of the
finest of its kind In the West. The.light
ning struck the college squarely on the
top of a rising projection In the front
part of the roof, and such a tremendous
crash _of thunder accompanied the flash
that all people in the neighborhood
thought an explosion had taken place in
the college. Almost before the first fire
engine had arrived the flames had spread
all through the five stories of the build
ing.
Adjoining the college is the smallest
building of the "West Side Hospital which
was filled with patients, about 100 being in
the various wards. As soon as it was
seen that the college could nofbe saved
and Its walls were liable to fall at any
time, the work of removing the patients
from the hospital began. Rain was fall-
Ing heavily at the time, but fortunately
there are so many hospitals and medical
institutions in the neighborhood that It
was necessary to remove the patients but
a short distance, most of them being
taken to the County Hospital, one square
away. The firemen and the attendants at
the hospitals did most of the moving,
carrying the invalids on beds, cots,
stretchers or whatever came to hand.
None of the hospital patients was Injured.

down, the steeo slope of a mountain this
morning between Banff and Calgary.
Brakeman Fitzhugh was seriously in
jured and Engineer Kennedy had his hand
crushed and was sent to the hospital.
A slide came down the rocky side of
the mountain just as the train was com
ing along. Trains are all running very
cautiously since the- beginning of the
trackmen's strike, and this freight was
going especially slowly. The engineer ap
plied the brakes and the train was at
a standstill almost as soon as the slide
struck the cars.
The engine now lies bottom up In the
bed of a small stream at the foot of the
slope. Two of the cars at the rear of the
train remained .on the track, while the
others followed the engine into the gulch.
The engineer went under the engine when
she first toppled over, and his escape was

Edward, which caused the seizure of the
last mentioned weekly neriodlcal by the
police of Dublin, Cork and other towns of
Ireland.
Mrs. Perry Summers, the wortan whose
Â«vldence was largely instrumental in
causing the indictment of. the alleged
Jynchers, has been afraid to return to v her
home in Lookout and :s etill in Alturas.
She fears that the friends of the lynchers
will wreak vengeance upon her should she
ko back to the scene of the tragedy. Judge
Harrington has promised that she will be
protected while Phe remains in Alturas.
There have been no additional arrests of
alleged lynchera since the incarceration
of Robert Leventon. James Brown and
Imotn Cades, and It does not appear likely
that there will be. The sympathy of the
Lookout country ie with the prisoners,
and a formidable array of legal talent has
been engaged in their defense. Judge Har
rington has telegraphed to Governor Gage
to send some good attorney to assist Dis
trict Attorney Bonner in the prosecution.
The case will be hard fought on both
Bides. The prisoners will soon have their
hearing, at which time the date of their
trial will be set.
The prisoners are conducting themselves
coolly end apparently do not fear the out
come. Their friends have already begun
to frame a defrase, and it is likely there
Trtll be some "tall swearing" done in court
Â¦when the cases are called. Lookout citl
lens visit the prisoners every day.
ALTTTRAS, June 25. â Superior Judge
Harrington and District Attorney Bonner,
â¢whose fearless attitude has resulted In
placing behind prison bars three men who
are accused of having been leaders of the
mob that hanged Calvin Hall, his three
eons and Daniel Yantis near Lookout, have
again stepped in to prevent the defeat of
Justice. A. C. Calburn, a young man who,
before the Grand Jury, gave damaging
testimony^ against the prisoners, has since
then been threatened that it were better
lor him If he should depart from this
district. Calburn, fearing an attempt upon
his life, closed up his affairs- here and was
preparing to leave when the court offi
cial* heard of his plans. District Attor
ney Bcnner at once ordered that he be
detained in the County Jail as a witness.

BAEKLEY EAST, CapÂ© Colony, Mon
day, June 24. â General Fouche's two Boer
commandos have advanced beyond Glen
Almond, which is about ten miles south
east of Aliwal North. Boer and British
scouts have exchanged shots six miles
hence. All the local defense forces have
been mobilized.
- CAPE TOWN, June 23.â Jacobus Bo
tha, the member of the Cape Assembly for
Aliwal North, has been captured by the
Boers and publicly sjamboked. In addi
tion, his house was burned. The reason
assigned for this treatment i3 that Botha
voted in favor of the treason bill.
LONDON, June 28.â The casualty Jlsts
made public by the War Office last night
I show severe fighting in various parts of
Africa that is not reported in the
."ordinary dispatches. This is noticeably so
[with regard to the Zeerust position in
! Cape Colony. It also destroys quietude,
i which. is added to by the repeated looting
! of Jamestown In spite of the proximity of
: a strong British force at Aliwal North. It
Â¦ appears that, including the ( Boer prisoners
and those in the concentration camps the
! cost of supporting some SO ,000 Boers is to
! day falling upon the British taxpayers.
I CAPE COLONY, June 25.â Details of the
engagement between General Eliot's col
! umn and Dewet's force near Reltz, June 6,
! show that the British surprised the Boer
â¢ convoy. The burghers fled, but. seeing
: that the captors were not in strong force,
! the Boers returned and charged with
j great determination, after desperate fight
ing recapturing the convoy.
Meanwhile Colonel DeL isle arrived with
reinforcements and the fighting was re
\ newed. The Boers lay beneath their
wagons and unflinchingly fired volleys
between the wheels, while their comrades
were engaged in inspanning and driving
off that portion of the convoy farthest
from the British. The latter pushed in
among the wagons, using their bayonets
freely. General Delarey was present,
and personally used a rifle. A man at his
right hand was killed and the comrade on
his left wounded. â¢
The affair ended in a series'of hand-to
hand encounters and fierce melees, the
â¢ Boers eventually being driven off. One of
j General Dewet's staff officers was wound
ed and taken prisoner.

LOS AXGELES.June 25.â The campaign
having for Its object the succession . to
United States Senator George C. Perkins,
whose term will expircwon March 4, 1903, is
in full blast in this end of the State. The
word has been passed down the line that
the present Senator is to have. the support
of the Republican State machine, and
such politics as \V. F. Herrin will do next
year is "to be done in Senator Perkins' in
terest
Governor Henry T. Gage has not yet
been brought around entirely to that way
of thinking, the Governor having once, it
will be remembered, criticised Senator
Perkins* public record rather severely.
The occasion was the free harbor jubilee
at San Pedro two years ago. The Gov
ernor and Senator Perkins are supposed
to have settled their differences since then
and tl-ey are now believed to be upon ex
cellent terms.
Senator Perkins" has established a Los
Angeles bureau, where his good points are
reiterated from early morning until late
at night. The scene of operations is the
Westminster Hotel, and the chief in
charge is James V. Kelly, erstwhile of
San Jcse.
"Jimmy" Kelly is said to have been se
lected ' as the Perkins field manager for
Southern Californiaâ the chief medicine
man south of the Tehachapiâ and it will
be Kelly's duty to select the proper ma*
terial for the legislative nominations next
year. .
Stephen Kelly - of San Bernardino, who
desires to Jbe the successor of John C.
Lynch as Collector of Internal Revenue,
Is one of James V. Kelly's principal lieu
tenants. Senator Perkins is in a quandary
over his position. He would like to reap
point Collector Lynch, but* Stephen Kelly
is in the way. Just how the Senator will
finally squirm out of a ticklish situation
Is a mystery, as Kelly and Lynch are both
certain, they say, of landing the prize.

While scientists are puzzling their brains
to find out the cause, each individual can.
by a little precaution, avoid the chances
of contracting dreaded and dangerous
kidney trouble, or eradicate It completely
from their system if already afflicted.
Many precious lives might have been, and
many more can yet be saved, by paying
attention to the kidneys.
It is the mission of The Call to benefit
its readers at every opportunity and.
therefore, we advise all who have any
symptoms of kidney or bladder trouble to
write to-day to Dr. Kilmer & Co.. Bing-
hamton, N. T.. for a free sample bottlÂ©
of Swamp-Root, the celebrated specific
which is having such a great demand
and remarkable success in the cure of the
most distressing kidney and bladder
troubles. With the sample bottle of
Swamp-Root will also be sent free a pam-
phlet and treatise of valuable informa-
tion.
To-day we see a, relative, a friend or an
acquaintance apparently well, and in a
few days we may be grieved to learn of
their serious Illness or sudden death,
caused by that fatal type of kidney trou-
bleâ Brieht's disease.
Kidney trouble often becomes advanced
into acute stages before the afflicted ia
aware of its presence; that Is why we
read of so many sudden deaths of promi-
nent business and professional men, phy-
sicians and others. They have neglected
to stop the leak in time.
At no time in the history of disease ha*
there been such an alarming increase in
the number of cases of any particular
malady as in that of kidney and bladder
troubles now preying upon the people of
this country.

Jeffries is a . much observed figure at
Catalina. In the shooting gallery, on the
beach, around the hotel, at the billiard
table, Hshing or swimming, he is always
watched by the curious visitor with all
the interest that attaches to the pugilis
tic peer. To those that have seen Jim
Jeffries in hjs early ring career he now
appears a different sort qf man â physical
ly speaking. He has grown so broad and
fleshy that he no longer gives the impres
sion of a tall, muscular : giant. HIa
shoulders, chest, arms and legs seem
bulkier, and there is a strong trace of
fat about him. His face shows lateral
extension and a puffing that was not no
ticeable a few years ago. The long rest
and the easy life have left their marks.
Jeffries and his manager, Joe Eagran.
who is with him. look for a fight in this
city some time in September. They de
clare that it matters not who his vis-a-vis
will be as long as it is another heavy
weight capable of drawing the crowd.
Jeffries seems anxious to meet somebody
and with this Idea in mind he has begun
light training at Catalina. Not many days
ago he tramped the hills for several
hours and brought back as a trophy sev
eral heads of wild goats. He Was not
quite bo successful in his fishing ven
tures. On Saturday last Jeffries started
with the rising sun and mafle a wild chase
for tuna. He fished the deep sea hour
after hour, and just before nightfall he
hooked to something of the finny tribe
that was thought to be a whale. Jeffries
fought the monster for an hour or more,
but did not kill the Pea demon. As facts
developed the monster proved to be a
small shark. Jeffries thought he had a
tuna. ,
The champion will remain at Catalina
for another week and will then leave for
San Francisco with his manager. Then
will come thÂ© battle of the prize fight
Hub* for this big fish to be run In harness
with another. Fltzsimmons or Ruhlin or
one of the> many younger aspirants for
championship decorations.
Jim Jeffries, pugilist and actorâ like all
the championsâ Is putting in a couple of
weeks at Catalina Island, where he is
making the best of all the outdoor facili
ties for exercise that place affords. And
this heavy-weight champion needs it. The
open life in boat on the sea and with the
gun In the canyons of the Catalina hills Is
medicine to him.' Not that Jeffries Is a
sick man, but he has taken on much cum
brous adipose, and to slough this extra
weight the present holder of the world's
first pugilistic laurels will be forced to go
through more than the ordinary training

Reports received at the headquarters
of the striking Ironworkers "are to the
effect that some of the smaller shops that
conceded the demands of -the , men : since"
the inauguration of the strike are. slowly
yielding to pressure and are either . clos
ing up or demanding the ten7hour-a-day
schedule ;^'at --the' old wages. " In Â¦ other
words, the conditions resumed ' are the
same â¢ as before â¢ the \ ironworkers made
their demands. These shops are depend-'
ent in : a large measure , upon the bigger
establishments, and their policy is prac
tically controlled by them.- \ . i ,
: Placards have been posted in various
parts of the city notifying- workmen that
employment may be obtained in the RIs
donlron Works. This is especially evU
dent in the neighborhood of the PresMio/
where every dead wall, fence ajnd bill
board bears a poster. Thousands:. of col
diers will be discharged in the city dur
ing the present week and many of them
will seek employment here. â Quite a num
ber, it is said, have gone to -work al
ready, but the demand -is .for more men.
All that show any capability in the llfle
of work embraced in the iron trades are
being engaged. , - ~
This situation is seriously considered at
headquarters, and efforts to stem the
tide are now being made. News of a pos
sible settlement of the controversy in the
East was anxiously awaited yesterday,
but nothing of a reassuring nature was
received. It was said that in the three
foundries and twenty machine shops that
had been unionized, a disposition on the
part of the owners ana -managers was
manifest to remain firm against any fur
ther maintenance of present conditions.
.A break is daily expected in the ranks
of the proprietors of restaurants now dis
playing the union card in the window.
It Is rumored that every card will come
down before the end of the week. A
meeting of the restaurant men and job
bing butchers was to have been held yes
terday afternoon, but a conflict in dates
caused its postponement. The Jobbing
butchers are not taking any part in the
matter as yet, and are continuing to sup
ply meat as usual.
"We have no interest in the matter at
all," said Sam C. Hammond, a member ol
the executive committee of the Jobbing
Butchers' Association. "This movement
originated entirely among the restaurant
men that accepted the union card and its
attendant schedule of wages. They find
now that they cannot do business at these
rates, and are heartily sick -of their bar
gain. .The butchers will take no -part in
the affair. As long as they can pay their
bills they will be supplied with meat, but
they are finding it hard now to make both
ends meet. The movement emanates en
tirely, from the union restaurant men, and
they will have to solve the question en
tirely among themselves." j
The Restaurant-Keepers' Association
discussed the situation thoroughly yester
day, but claimed that matters Â¦ were in
such condition that the strike of the cooks
and waiters would die of inanition within
a day or two.

AN OTHEB WONDEB OF SCIENCE
Biology Has Proved That Dandruff
Is Caused by a Gtenn.
Ecior.ce is doing wonders these days in
medicine as well as in mechanics. Since
.Adam delved, thQ human race has been
! troubled with dandruff, for which no hair
preparation has heretofore proved a suc-
cssf ul cure until Newbro's Herpicide was
put on the market. It is a scientific prepa-
ration that kills the cerm and makes dan-
druff or scurf by dig^rine into the scalp to
get at the root of the hair, where it snps
the vitality; causing itching scalp, falling
hair and finally baldness. Without dan-
druff hair must grow luxuriantly. Herpi-
cide at all druggists. It is the only de-
Btroyer of dandruff. x

THE EMPOBrCTM.
THE EMPORIUM.A TRANSMITTER WITH MEGAPHONE ATTACHMENT IS PLACED IN
THE CAVE OF THE ..WINDS AND THE STUPENDOUS ROAR OF THE
F.ALLS TRAVELS MILES AWAY TO NEW YORK. -
ALONG distance telephone transmitter with megaphone attachment has been
. installed in the Cave of the Winds at Niagara Falls, in order that the stu
pendous, deafening roar of the Falls of Niagara may be transmitted over
the Bell telephone .lines to New York, Buffalo, the Pan- American Exposi
tion and other places.
The megaphoni catches up the roar of the falling waters, leads it into the tele
phone transmitter, from which it passes into the telephone exchange at Niagara
Falls, where the roar is supplied at the will of the operators to subscribers, or is
turned into the long distance lines, which carry it to New York or to the Bell tel
ephone exhibit in the electricity building of the Pan-American Exposition.' It 13
heard over the telephone with wonderful realistic intensity, and one can easily im-'
agine the tumbling, tossing, plunging waters striking the rocky talus in front of
the Cave of the.Winds. . < , .
THE CALL'S efforts in behalf of wireless telegraphy are meeting
with the approval of those who are familiar with the workings of
the Marconi system. Since July, 1900, monthly reports have been
sent to Washington by the chief signal officer of the Department of
California certifying to the efficacy of the wireless system in use be
tween Alcatraz Island and Fort Mason. This system was installed
under the supervision of Lieutenant Rieber, now a lieutenant
colonel on General Miles' staff. .
, The Weather Bureau chief has also been receiving reports from Govern
ors Island, New York, where a similar system was installed a year ago. The
plant at Fort Mason has only been used for practice by the signal corps men
stationed here. It was erected for test purposes, and, proving successful,
was allowed to remain, as at any time a break in the cable connecting
Alcatraz Island /with the mainland might occur. On many occasions the sig
nal corps men have used it as a means of communication, and at ho time has
it failed to work.
' It is not entirely the Marconi system that is in use here and at the New-
York fort. The signal corps men, under the direction of Lieutenant Rie
ber, sought to improve upon the invention of the Italian inventor. They suc
ceeded, and since the erection of the plant here have had no difficulty in
keeping it in working order at a very low, cost.

, Kansas is still in the. center of the stage. A revered
citizen of tjiat State haS been asleep continuously for
two months, and a Kansas private soldier; just returned
from' the; Philippines, after two years, of army'ser
vice, has bought a $2000 farm and paid cash, for, it out

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
"SHERMAN i IN SIGHT."
WHEN The Call installed a wireless telegraph
plant at the Cliff House, using the lightship,
nine miles out, as its ocean outpost, and
received the message,""Sherman in sight," it brought
in sight almost a new world. When the lenses were
fitted into a tube and the first tejescope was turned to
the stars, a universe was brought within range of the
assisted eye. There followed a' great intellectual
awakening in the small world that could comprehend
the vast. problems of mathematical and physical as
tronomy,: but to the mass of mankind the event was
without significance. . :
Not so with Morse's discovery of the telegraph, and
its application to ocean cables, and Marconi's inspira
tion that obsoletes the wire. These discoveries and
inventions are of the highest value to mankind. In
this age certainty and rapidity of communication be
tween distant points have become factors in the eco
nomic condition of the people of all the ,world, and
a necessity in commerce and politics. The fortunes
of a California wheat-grower may depend on prompt
news of the blowing of the rain-bearing monsoon in
India, or of the invasion of the Russian crop by the
fly. From far field, orchard and vineyard the spark
of electricity brings that information upon which men
may plan for future profit or prevent future loss.
When The Call station at the beach received
through the air the message, "Sherman in sight,"; it
meant in sight economies for the people of this State
amounting to millions. We do not boast in saying
that this first practical use of the wireless system was
as necessary to its acceptance and success as was the
patronage of Congress to the demonstration of
Morse's discovery. From- that moment the Marconi
system ceased to be an interesting laboratory experi
ment, and emerged- from the realm of speculation and
doubt. "
It was significant and proper that j the epoch
making message thrilled through the air from the
heaving bosom of the sea to the coast of California.
Here will be gained some of the first and greatest
benefits of wireless telegraphy. The weather service,
which is of such vast importance to our productive
interests, has been deprived of much of its power to
do good because it can get reports of meteorological
conditions from the land only, while the local weather
that may help or hurt our crops is affected by the con
ditions over the sea also. Secretary Wilson has de
termined to put a Marconi station on the Farallones,
which will give the signal office an outpost that is
not in sight from the shore. ' But who shall say that
that will be all? When Morse stretched his line from
Baltimore to Washington it was thought that would
be the maximum distance over which the current
could be sent by wire. Now, however, by use of the
local circuit and methods of reinforcement the world
is belted. Who, then, can limit the possibilities of
Marconi's discovery? If the Sherman could be seen
from the lightship when hull down and her coming
ticked to shore nine miles away, and if the Farallones
can be hailed twenty-four miles away and below the
horizon, who shall say that distance or the curvature
of the earth shall bar communication with Hawaii or
more distant land?
The signal service and the State Board of Trade
have gone far to demonstrate that our California rains
can be foretold three months in advance by knowing
the temperature on Unga and other islands of the
Aleutian Archipelago. The Japan current being the
source of our moisture and its evaporation depending
upon temperature, when that current deflects from. its
no"rmal course and enters Bering Sea through the
Aleutian passes, it parts with its warmth there, and
when it reaches us three months later chilled by its
Arctic wanderings it is as cold as the air and we get
no rain. Now with a Marconi station on Unga Island
communicating with Unalaska, we can know if the
rise of temperature on the archipelago in July, August
and September indicates that the current has gone
vagabonding and we are to miss our early rains. If
this theory of the cause of our droughts be true, and
by every known fact and all analogy it is true, the
command of knowledge of Aleutian conditions by the
signal service is worth millions to California.
All this came in sight when the Sherman was re
ported to The Call.
"About that time and later the Examiner was fill
ing its columns with reports that Tesla had tele
graphed to the planet Mars, and * by other devices
was seeking to cast ridicule upon Marconi and the
marvels born in his genius.
It is' interesting that the late Judge -Hastings was
the first man to discuss the probability that electric
currents in the air would transmit sound and energy.
He printed an essay on the subject about thirty years
ago that would be interesting reading now if it could
be found. > - . .
Â¦When Rockefeller visited the University of Chicago
the students greeted him with a song having the re
frain: "Rocks, rocks, rocks, give us loads of rocks,
gold, bullion, coin and ducats too." It is not a -very
lofty song, but perhaps it reached as high as the
Rockefeller intellect. .
ANOTHER PARTY.
A THIRD party has been born and brought up
in Missouri It has not been named yet, but
several of its parents are yelling various names
in a barrel, intending to take the one that sounds
best Its principal sire seems to be Mr. Merriwether
of St. Louis. He ran at the last election for Mayor
of that city as a Democratic bolter against the Gold
Democrat who was elected. His proceedings as a
pessimist and a progenitor give the lie to both ends
of his name. He is not merry nor a wether.
He talks of the republic in epitaphs, and believes
that freedom shrieked when he was beaten for Mayor.
He hopes to do something raising a new crop where
our ancient liberties are buried, hence his new party.
It is to bring about Government ownership of all
public utilities, railroads, telegraphs, steamer lines and
telephones. Along with this he will have the initia
tive and referendum, and full legal tender money is
sued by the Government in sufficient volume for busi
ness purposes, and the volume in proportion to the
population. It is evident that Mr. Merriwether in
tends to impress the members of his party with the
idea that the Government should furnish them with
money whether they have collateral or not But he
suggests a double ratio in the matter of. volume. There
is to be a volume sufficient for business purposes, and
also a volume in proportion to the population.
Does he intend that these two volumes shall be sep
arate or merged? Then how is he to have a volume
in proportion to the population unless he plainly
states the amount per capita? Again, suppose that the
volume in proportion to the population shall not be a
sufficient volume for business, or too large a volume
for business, how will he reconcile the two?
It will be seen that his financial scheme is a renewal
of all the old fallacies. General Weaver and the early
greenbackers taught their followers that it was the
duty of the Government to give every man all the
money he wanted. That implied the obligation to
give him more when the first lot was gone. It was a
proposition to enable every man to eat his cake and
keep it. Will Mr. Merriwether do that, or will he
have the Government compel every man to keep his
share of the money that will be issued in proportion
to the population?
It is said that Mr. Bryan favors this new party move,
and he should, for he proposed last year that every
man should draw interest instead of paying interest
on his note of hand. A cross between his system and
Mr. Merriwether's would inspire confidence in coun
terfeiting as a sounder system of finance.
Added to this bright and shining money scheme
the new party will have Government ownership and
operation of public utilities. All of the employes of
those enterprises are to work for the Government and
look to it for their bread and their butter, and busi
ness is to look to it for a sufficient volume of money,
and the people are to look to it for a volume of
money in proportion to the population, and after the
Government has been" doing all these things for
awhile the best friends of the republic would not
recognize it if they met it in the road at high noon.
When one reads this third party prospectus he
wonders what the members thereof think of the
fathers and founders of the government Our insti
tutions have been in operation only a little more than
a century. When they were founded we were the
weakest people on earth, and under them we have
become the strongest. In the arts of peace arid war
we hold the world at bay.- What right, then, have
these pseudo reformers to. demand a revolution in
those institutions?
In a century of administration mistakes have been
made and have been. corrected at great cost, but do
these galvanized reformers pretend that their fantastic
system will work infallibly and produce better re
sults? :'. . V
CHINESE ALLUREMENTS.
MINISTER WU. TING FANG and certain
supporters of his diplomacy are making an
earnest effort in the Eastern- States to pre
vent the extension of' the Chinese exclusion law. It
appears their arguments are addressed to the business
interests of the East, and they are promising all kinds
of advantages to manufacturers and to merchants if
our Government will withdraw its restrictions upon
Chinese immigration. -
In all that there is nothing surprising. Appeals to
commercial interests are common in our time, and
since such appeals have been j made by us to gain
support of our invasion of China, it is but natural that
astute Chinamen should make similar appeals in order
to win favor for a Chinese industrial invasion of this'
country. *
All of that is what might have been expected, but
there is something. curious in the kind of appeals
which the Eastern people admit to be alluring and
attractive. For example, the Springfield Republican
in describing the arguments of the Chinese diplo
matists says: "They also tellus that a plentiful supply
of Chinese labor would- enormously, develop the re
sources of the United States, particularly those of
the South, where material development has been slow.
The Chinese Consul General in New York talks al
luringly to Southern plantation owners when he says:
'Repeal the exclusion act and the Chinese will turn
the great marshes of the South into rice lands, and
in other parts they will huild great tea gardens.' The
negroes, who have furnished labor . to . the ' South for
a century, could -almost be exterminated -in .two ' or
three generations by the. competition of coolies Chi
nese labor could transform the South in fifty years
it' could make Xuba a finely cultivated garden in
twenty-five* years." .
The Republican does not advocate a repeal. of the
restriction law, nor object to extend it for 'another
It would-be aboon to the States which have the
unhappy reputation of being proof against consump
tion. ; . . , Â¦. , - : . -Â¦
Surely that is a precedent' for joint State' and Fed
eral action in providing a retreat for consumptives
where they may be isolated under circumstances the
most favorable to recovery and the best .adapted ; to
check or prevent infection of the * sound.
If the medical prbfession'in every State would com
bine upon such a. plan, it would be easy to secure co
operation of all the States in its execution, and such
a division of the first cost among the*" States, and with
the Federal "Government, as would make it easy of
accomplishment. The United States owns the' Hot
Springs of Arkansas. The therapeutic quality of the
waters was considered of such value that the Gov
ernment bought out all the private" rights there, and
the springs are run by a Federal superintendent.
It should be possible to form in some. such place
a reservation, provided with every appliance for the
comfort and cure of consumptives, for disinfection of
their excreta, and to make such reservation so de
sirable that all patients would' seek it voluntarily, as
all who are able to do so now seek the hot springs
for rheumatism and neuralgia, and Carlsbad for liver
and kidney diseases.
It may well be worth while to inquire into the fa
cilities for isolation offered by' certain desert * tracts
in Arizona. Near Phoenix there are already estab
lished camps of consumptives, but there may be found
mingling with them rheumatic, asthmatic and hay
fever patients, all seeking'the same dear, dry desert
air and congenial heal. Many a patient has in those
camps exchanged rheumatism for consumption, con
tracted â¢ by infection.
It is evident that public opinion must accept and
back up some comprehensive plan for,, the isolation
and extirpation of this dreadful disease.
Consumption is a disease of. civilization. Primitive
people, like our Indians, who Jived naturally, knew
it not. But take an Indian and put .him in a house
and white man's clothes, and in nearly every instance
he will develop the disease. The analogy is plain.
If civilized people live in such climatic^conditions as
to require less clothing, less shelter, and to permit
the proper enjoyment of outdoor life, their return,
to that' degree, to the primitive and natural way of
life, lessens their liability to develop consumption.
But the disease is transmitted by infection, and when
its bacilli are present, distributed , in the sputa of suf
ferers, no climate is proof against it.
The sooner these Western States and Territories,
whose clement climate is their most valuable asset,
accept and act upon this conclusion the better it will
be for their future welfare.
Dr. Sewall's conclusion is: "That nothing is
clearer in the history of demography than the fact that
localities, if not climates, which were at one time fa
vorable to the recovery of the consumptive patient
later lose this beneficent power and even become h6t
beds of the disease through cases contracting it on
the spot. That is, consumption, though at first
exotic, later becomes indigenous."
. Southern California is having the same sad ex
perience, and our sanitary authorities have even con
sidered a quarantine against exotic cases and meas
ures to stamp out the disease within the State./
Minnesota has exactly the same history. v It has a
dry climate, favorable to outdoor life, and as there
were in pioneer times no cases of indigenous con
sumption it was widely advertised as a prophylactic
climate, and sufferers sought it with good results
that surprised medical men. The clear, dry air and
invitation to outdoor life effected cures as remark-"
able as any that are in the record of Colorado and
California. But the patients who found life there
seeded the State with death for others, and Minne
sota no longer boasts immunity, and has - fortunately
lost her reputation as a sanitarium.
The climate was no doubt kindly to sufferers who
had contracted the disease elsewhere, and the fact
that at first it did not originate there gave rise to the
belief that Colorado was consumption proof. This
flattering delusion* is dispelled by Dr. Sewall. who
reports that 13 per cent of the- local -deaths from
consumption are cases that originate in Colorado.
The greatest number of indigenous cases are in the
cities, but no parÂ£ of the State is exempt from the
potential development of the disease. This condition
is due entirely to infection of the State from imported
cases. ,
THE State; of Colorado was inclined to resent
Dr. Sewall's report to the State Medical So
ciety that tuberculosis has become indigenous
there. , : â¢ '" . ..'-.
CLIMATE AND CONSUMPTION.
It has been decided that the Santiago medal shall
bear the face of Sampson on one side, but there
seems to be a hopeless perplexity as to what shall be
placed on the other." A proposal to put the Oregon
there was set aside on account of Eastern objections.
If nothing better be, offered the thing might be made
to look pretty by a picture of.Hobson kissing a girl.

"VS'ILk PROBABLY 'LOSE HIS HANDâ A.
Padden. while at .work in the Bowers Rubber
Factory on Commercial street yesterday, got hr|
left hand caught in the revolving cutter. â¢ The
hand was badly crushed and it may have to be
amputated at the wrist. Padden lives with his
parents at 113V4 Lily avenue.
The popular music to be used during the
convention will consist of buch songs as
are familiar to all Protestant religious or
ganizations. The famous Park sisters and
other celebrities will also be present and
assist in making the music of the con
vention one of its features to be most
pleasantly remembered. â¢
The speakers who have been selected to
address the different meetings of the con
vention are more than 100 in number and
have been chosen from among the most
prominent religious leaders of the coun
try. In addition to the - regular pro
gramme, many additional evangelistic ex
ercises are being , planned and visiting
clergymen will appear, in* nearly every
pulpit in San Francisco, either at the
time of the convention or immediately
following It. Everything connected with
the affair is said to be progressing
smoolhly-and its success Is assured.
Sections of the chorus have been prac
ticing weekly for several months in Los
Angeles, Oakland, Fresno, . Sacramento,
San Jose and in this city. On the after
noon of the day on which f ho grand con
cert is to be held, the chorus will hold a
mass rehearsal in Mechanics' Pavilion.
The music for the meetings and concerts
has been selected from the best works of
the masters, and when rendered by such
a large number of voices, with the accom
paniment of the immense organ, the effect
will undoubtedly be most inspiring.
The musical programme arranged for
the Epworth League Convention will bo
one of its most attractive features. The
committee in charge of that portion of
the exercises has spared no trouble or ex
pense in its efforts to secure talent and
appliances worthy of the Important event,
i The great pipe organ, which Mrs. Stan
ford has had built for Stanford Univer
sity, has been loaned by her to the league
for use during the convention, and will be
a great attraction for the visitors. This
organ will accompany the grand chorus of
2000 voices which has been organized in
California for the occasion.

"The California Powder Works,. In my
oplnion.had no just cause for complaint.
Its total assessment In the State of all
its property. Including the franchise, was
only 44 per cent of the amount for which
the property has been selling in , the open
market for more than a year past. The
franchise tax, as fixed by, me,- if paid by
the company would have '- reduced the
yearly dividends of the stockholders only
25 cents on $12â that is to say; the yearly
dividends to these stockholders, who pay
no tax on their stock, would have- been
reduced from $12 per year on each share
of stock to $11 75."
"I have reason to believe," said Asses
sor . Dodge, "that the State Board of
Equalization will not permit the Assessor
of any county to grossly undervalue for
assessment purposes such franchises,
thereby diminishing the State revenue
which they should yield. All such taxes
paid to the State lower the State rate of
taxation and thus benefit the taxpayers
in all counties. The Assessor of no one
county, therefore, should be permitted to
deprive other counties of the benefit of
such revenue In order that his j county
may profit in a . smaller degree by
his failure to properly assess such fran
chises. . . Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢.
The State Controller yesterday directed
the Tax Collector to withdraw from sale
the real estate of the California Powder
Works, securing the taxes on Its fran
chise, which it has neglected to pay. Fol
lowing this action the Attorney General
of the Stato will buo the corporation for
the amount of taxes delinquent on the
assessment of its franchise. . This Is a
procedure which the State rarely resorts
to, but which the revenue law recognizes
whenever the amount of taxes Involved
is in excess of $300. As the State, as well
as the city and county of San Francisco,
Is directly Interested in the collection of
these taxes it will inaugurate the neces
sary legal steps to enforce such collection.
The California Powder Works, accord
ing to Assessor Dodge, is the only pri
vate corporation which has removed Its
office from San Francisco as a result of
the assessment on Its franchise. Shortly
after the assessment last year the cor
poration removed Its principal place of
business to Contra Costa County. Should
the Assessor of that county refuse to as
sess its franchise the State would loso
the revenue to be collected therefrom.
State Controller Is to
Proceed Against

He says: "The patient was a man who
had suffered, to my knowledge, for years
with dyspepsia. Everything he ate seemed
to sour and create gases in the stomach.
He had pains like rheumatism In the
tack, shoulder blades and limbs, fullness
and distress after eating, poor appetite
and loss of flesh; the heart became affect-
ed, causing palpitation and sleeplessness
at nieht.
"I gave h!m powerful nerve tonics and
blood remedies, but to no purpose. As an
experiment I finally bought a 50-cent
package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at
a drug store and gave them to him. Al-
most immediate relief was given and af-
ter he had used four boxes he was to all
appearances fully cured. Â¦ â
"There was no more -acidity or sour,
Â¦watery risings, no bloating after meals,
the appetite was vigorous and he has
gained between 10 and 12 pounds in weight
of solid, heilthy flesh.

STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 25.â Prices of stocks re
acted sharply to-day and were . carried down
under such active selling as has not been seen
In the market for Bcveral weeks past. This
development did not make itself Jelt until, late
in the day, and after such a period of neglect
and apathy on the part of the speculative and
investment interests as in itself invited attack
on prices by professional bears. There was . a
continual slight dribble of stocks on the mar
ket under which prices slowly but pretty stead
ily, yielded, except for a few special cases,
where a desultory speculation for the rise cen
tered, or v/here buying was Induced by causes
Individual to the stocks.' These were entirely
without influence . on the general list. A
rather general tendency to recover from some
opening declines had the edge taken off It by
the first bulletin announcement of the suspen
sion of an . important bank in Leipzig. ,The
course of German bank shares for the last few
days has indicated an unsettled condition of
affairs in Germany, and to-day's occurrence
arouses apprehension that the coming ' semi
annual settlements in Berlin may be the oc
casion of a more or, l*s extended collapse.
The recent failure of a bank in Dresden re
vealed such a state Â«f involvement with for
merly Inflated industrial securities, which had
suffered from the industrial depression in Ger 7
many, that the credit of many industrial en
terprises was considerably undermined. But
at this time the German money market Is un
usually well equipped to meet a crisis. The
consideration of these conditions made the
speculative mind sensitive, and late In the
day. wjien many rumors began to circulate of
local banking troubles, there was a Hvely
f pill ins out of stocks all through "the list. The
bears made the most of their unexpected op
portunity and offered prices down boldly, while
the rumors were at the high tide- of exaggera
tion. They succeeded in breaking through the
defense which had been established by the
bull leaders while they were away for their
vacations, and heavy stop-loss orders were
uncovered. Stocks with any large speculative
accounts in them' were naturally most affected,
notably St. Paul and Missouri Pacific, the
former dropping 5 points. When the nature
of the investigations being made by the Clear
ing-House Association of the affairs between
one of -the banks and the association became
more accurately known and It was announced
that no action would be necessary, there was
a lively scramble on the part of the profes
sional shorts to cover, and the rally In the
principal acUve stocks was between 1 and 2
points. St. Paul recovering 2%. The closing,
however, was not free from feverlshness, and
was rather irregular. The money market was
not disturbed.
The bond market was affected by late sell-
Ing, but in a much less degree than stocks.

Weather Report.
Generally warm, clear weather has prevailed
during the week, with fogs- at night along
the coast, and conditions have been very
favorable for the maturing of grain and de
ciduous fruits. 'Â¦ Â¦Â¦ ' \ '-.'.
Grain harvest is progressing rapidly In all
parts of the State. Tha results thus far are
said to be entirely satisfactory to farmers,
end nearly all reports agree that the yield of
wheat, barley and r-e will be better than an
ticipated earlier in the season; the quality is
reported superior. In some places farmers are
Felling their grain as eoon as harvested, thus
eaving storage, but the warehouses will re
ceive a larr? portion of the crop. The hay
crop is being rapidly harvested, baled and
ttackcii, and in many sections is the best
yield lor several seasons'. Heavy shipments
of corn and tomatoes are being made from
Vacaville. Potatoes are yielding a fair crop.
The sugar beet crop in portions of Southern
California will be the largest for several
years. Hops, beans and garden vegetables
are in good condition and will j-ield average
crop?. Pasturage is becoming very dry in
eome sections, and cattle are being driven to
the_ northern ranges.
Vineyardists in some sections are reported to
be losing considerable quantities of the older
vines, and many attribute the cause to the
thrf-e Fuccefsive dry years. Deciduous fruits
er? ripenfr.B rapidly, and In many places are
yielding nearly averase crops. Oranges, olives
and walnuts continue in good condition. .
Sacramento Valley.â Conditions have been
favorable for all crops during the week, and
prain and fruit have matured rapidly. Grain
harvest is prcg*Â»Â»Elng In all sections; the
yieid is reported large and the quality excel
lent. Haying is not yet completed; a heavy
crop is being harvested. Potatoes are yielding
a good crop. Corn, hops and garden vegetables
are doing well. Tragedy prunes and early
peaches are being gathered, and are yielding
pood crops. Apricot drying Is progressing.
Gi-ai*Â»s and citrus fruits are In good condi
tion, and will probably yield fully average
crops.
<"oast and Bay Sections.â The weather has
been slightly warmer than during the preced
ing week, causing more rapid maturing of the
grain and fruit crprs. Grain harvest is pro
gressing in nearly all sections, and an excel
lent crap Is being gathered in most places;
the yield i? reported very light, however. In por
tions of Lake County. Hay making continues

WHEAT â Liverpool futures were lower and
Paris futures firmer.
Chicago was dull and still tending downward,
with continued liquidation.. Crop reports were
such as to lead to the general expectation of
weak markets. Minnesota. Manitoba and Da
kota report prospects for the largest crop for
ycarp. Against this, however, Is the gloomy
report from France, which says that the phe-'
nomenally cold weather has produced a very
bad effect all over Europe, and especially In
France, where the crop Is *a1d to be ruined.
Hence the French Importation of American
Wheat will bo very large. Two firms alone are
said to have already ordered more than the
entire French importation from the United
States In 1900.
Bradntrcpt's estimate of stocks Is as follows:
East oC the Rockies, a decrease of 3,026,C00

CLOSING,
The stock market was stagnant to-day
awaiting to-morrow's settlement. Prices were
heavy on the failure of the Leipzig Bank, fol
lowing the suspension of the Dresden Credit
Anstalt a few days ago. This caused free Ber
lin selling Â¦ of Americans, Canadians, Argen
tine and Brazilian stocks. New York bought
Pennsylvania. Illinois Central .and | New York
Central, but in â¢ very limited amounts. â¢ The
rest dragged. Money was harder, the call
rate running up to 2Vi per cent. ;

' CHICAGO, June .25.â Wheat opened lower on
cables, j together with good crop reports. There
was . very little trading, with offerings quite
general. Bradstreet's report of a decrease of
4,400,000 bushels In the. world's visible supply
was a 'strengthening influence, and prices ral
lied after the opening,' which was at
the . low point ' of the day. The -general news,
however, was ' bearish, the splendid showing
of the new crop in the Southwest being a
leading factor. . The first car of new wheat
arrived here to-day from Oklahoma and was
'perfect In . quality and condition. Â¦ September
opened t Vi<S%c to â¢ lower at 6Cc to 66Vic.
There was considerable commission house sell
ing : around these figures. A rally was
brought â¢ about by shorts covering, the price
going to 66>,4c. A slight reaction followed,
but the- close was firm and V4c down at 66%@
66M1C. :"Â¦;.'
Lower cables imparted a weakness to corn
at the opening,- and the continued liquidation
of July holdings tended to increase the bear
ish feeling. Receipts continue small and the
demand poor. Reports of damage 'by the heat
in the West . were considered by some a bull
feature. September closed %@%c higher at
44?i@44%c.
; Liquidation of July and selling of that op
tlcn by Phillips was the feature in the oats
market. The spread between July and Sep
tember : narrowed to %c. September closed %c
higher at 26%.
Provisions were Â¦ dull a,nd the market feat
ureless. September, pork closed 10c lower,
lard 5c lower and ribs 2^4c lower.

And now, what has the club done? A study
of the sociological conditions in the United
States before the club era shows that the life
of women in those times was very isolated.
They only knew women who worshiped In
the . same church or the wives of those , men
who belonged to the same political party as
their own husbands. The club brought out
new lines, new thoughts and new ideas. It
has served to bring sects and creeds
and uncial relations together. This Is
what the women's club Is for: to bring you
out of the bondage of relationship only ' to
those who form your own religious sect or
political parties. This Is why the club has
become a great social force in out country.
women do begins In womanly things, and orig

eIe Originated in the desire of a few women to
attend a party, the particular one being that
at which Charles Dickens was to be enter
tained when he came to New York. The Press
Club was to give the reception, and Jennie
June, who belonged to the Press Club, de
cided to get a new dress for the occasion. Her
husband told her this was unnecessary, as there
would be no women present. Discovering this
to be actually the- state of affairs, she
thought It was time for the women to organ

BERKELEY, June*" 25.âRepresen
. tative women from Berkeley,
Oakland, Alameda and San Fran
cisco and other still more distant
cities tilled the First Unitarian
Church to-day to greet Mrs. May Wright
Sewall, president" "of the International
Council of Women, and to take part in
the symposium on "Women's Work and
Women's Clubs." Four separate topics
upon women's work weie programmed,
each of which was to be presented by Mrs.
Sewall. followed by. discussion by those
present.
Mrs. Emma Snell Paulson called the
meeting to order at 10 o'clock and asked
for nominations for a presiding officer.
Mrs. Emma Shafter Howard was -chosen
by acclamation, and immediately took the
chair. Her address of welcome pertained
to the function and importance of the
Women's International Council, wUch
was organized in 1883 with the object of
bringing women's work into universal,
concerted activity.
The introduction of Mrs. Sewall was ac
companied by a wave of enthusiasm that
swept over the assemblage and forced the
distinguished speaker to wait several min
utes before the applause ceased. Through
a misunderstanding the first topic was
changed, and Mrs. Sewall opened the dis
cussion with an address on "Women's
Clubs." She said in part:
The first well-known club Along the lines of
modern -onrantzation was . rot Â¦ the Sorosls In
New Ycrk, not the New England Women's
Club In Boston, but one in a little town In
Indiana, called New Harmony. There the
Owen lamily, who gave bo much to the State
In richness of Intellect and who, when the
constitution of the State was formed, called
! for equal civil liberty to women, resided.
There was a gifted woman in the family, a
daughter, who had been sent to Germany and
France to Study. On her return ehe felt her
lon^linefs. and, by the association of a few
women of her kind, organized a women's club.
Ten years later in New York Jennie June
was asked by Alice and Phoebe Cary to or
g-anlze a women's club. Confronted by the
need of a constitution and Ignorant of the
methods of procedure, they consulted Ella
: Deets Clymer, a member of the New Harmony
' /Hub. She not only agreed to help them, but
i T?he was the chief writer of the original con-
I stltutlon of Sorosls.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
For the last two years Mr. Mason, has
, been playing leading roles with the Froh
man stock company at Daly> Theater,
: New. York, there achieving a. considerable
success. The actor will make his first ap
pearance as Charles Darney in "The Only
Way," the part played here by Frank
Worthing last year on the occasion of the
play's presentation by Henry Miller at
the" Columbia. . .
"The Only Way" will be the first offer
ing of the Frawley company, and will
be put on next Monday evening. The
play made a sensation on its first pro
duction here last year, and. many play
goers will be glad to take advantage of
the opportunity to renew acquaintance
with Freeman Wills' clever dramatic ren
dering of Dickens' picturesque "Talo of
Two Cities." ...-.'
Local representatives of the Santa Fe
Railroad know nothing- of the proposed
plan to form an Italian, colony In the San
Joaquin Valley. According to a dispatch
published in a morning paper and alleged
to have cmannted from a Chicago Jour
nal, the Santa Fc Railroad Company was
about to send agents to Italy and later to
other European countries, whose labors,
It was expected, would result in ma'hy
thousands of Italians coming- to this
country and locating on lands in Southern
California, New Mexico and California.
The principal objective point in this State.
was said to be the San Joaquin Valley. '
H. K. Gregory, assistant general passen
ger agent- of the Santa Fe line, knows
nothing about this proposed plan
."Our latest folder," he said, "does not
give the namo of any agent in Italy.-Sev
eral'local Italian agents have spoken to
me about, .the matter. but...I' was' unable
to give them any information.' -.Â¦"Perhaps
later I-may have some advices from Chi
cago, where the head officers -are located,
bqt as yet- 1 cannot give any definite In
formation. In a matter of this kind I
think I would be early advised, . as it
would-be a matter- of great importance to
the Pacific Coast." .,
Chevalier Carlos F. Serra, ConsulTGen
eral of Italy, puts little credence in the
dispatch. He said: - .
"The better rlass of Italians can- find
as good opportunities at" home as they can
here, for the employment and enjoyment
of their wealth. I do-not expect any gen
eral exodus of my countrymen. Too many
considerations are involved. .When an
Italian leaves -Mb native land and settles
in this country he generally does so on
the advice- of a relative who preceded
him. He soon fits himself.. to conditions
and rears his lamily, and his sons "and
daughters become an integral part of the
community. From my knowledge of my
people I would unhesitatingly say that the
proposition would not for a moment be
seriously considered, as the problem of
earning a. living: would be. a. most serious
question until the^arid lands could be
made productive. An Italian with suffi
cient capital to farm for. three years or
more without return would probably pre
fer to remain at home."

II JJ DREU, pastor of the Church of
Kjt' Nuestra Senora de Gundalupe,
ll^N. yesterday celebrated the twenty
fifth anniversary of his â¢ ordina
tion to the priesthood.' A solemn high
mass was celebrated in, the Spanish
church and the parishioners crowded the
place of worship and prayed that their
beloved pastor might continue' his noble
work. Archbishop RIordan Is in retreat
at Santa Clara College and was unable
to lend his presence on this auspicious
occasion. . He, however, sent a- beautiful
letter and a breviary to the pastor in ap
preciation of his services to the church.
-At the solemn high mass Father San
tandreu acted as celebrant and Father
Lagan and Father Cummings, his class
mates,- acted as his- assistants. Special
music was rendered by an augmented
choir under the direction of Professor Ar
rillaga.
â¢ In the afternoon the Sunday school Class
tendered a reception- to the father . and
presented him with beautiful gifts. A
number of presents were given Father
Santandreu by his people.
Father Santandreu was born at Burgos,
Spain. After years of study in the Semi
nary of Urgel he finished his ecclesiasti
cal course In All Hallows College of For
eign Missions, Dublin, Ireland, where he
was ordained. At the request of the late

LOS ANGELES, June 25.â Ben Trimble
; of Los Angeles knocked out Tom Reilly
.of San Francisco in the final round of a
twenty-round contest before the Alpha
Athletic Club to-night. The end came
rather suddenly in the last thirty seconds
of the fighting. During a mix-up, Trim
ble sent in a vicious right swing to the
jaw that floored Reilly. As the latter
struggled to his feet the local man fin
ished his helpless opponent with a suc
cession of rights and lefts to the face.
Previous to the knockout Reilly had a
shade the better of the contest, landing
two blows to Trimble's one, besides dis
playing great cleverness in blocking the
latter's blows. Owing to the fact that
Trimble was at least nine pounds over
weight, the men agreed to a division of
the purse. Harry Stuart refereed the con

General Young is well known in this
city. He was stationed at the Presidio
seme years ago as lieutenant colonel of
the Fourth Cavalry, in command of the
equadron at that post, and later as a
colonel of cavalry and commandant of the
post. He went to Manila as a brigadier
and returned with two stars. He will re
tire in 1904.
General Young said last evening that
ihcre would be no change In the personnel
of th*> department staff with the excep
tion of the aids who form the personal
â¢. '.off of the general. General Young will
have for hie aid* Captain H. P. Howard,
Â¦jhlrteenth Cavalry; Captain W. R. Smed
berr. late of the Fourth Cavalry, and
Lieutenant James F. McKlnley, of the
tilxth Cavalry. Ueutenant McKlnley Is a
r.ephew of the President. Captain Smod
bcrg is a uon of Colonel W. It. Smedbcrg
ct thie city. It will be noticed that all
three aidn arÂ«Â» of the cavalry, the branch
of the service in which General Young
r;:ent his >cBr* Flnce he entered the regu
j*r army, lust after the civil war. Hie
lirpt service was as a private in 1861, and
~f:er winning distinction In the ranks and
:.s an officer of volunteers he entered the
rtpular service and rose steadily until
:iow he Is one of the high general officer*.
General Young has no particular plans
for the department, except to carry it
along as it has been working. He will
have to muster out the last of the volun
teers, for they will hardly be out of the
service before he takes charge.
General Young arrived in this country
from the Philippines last April after
making a brilliant record for himself dur
ing his island service. He went at once
to Washington, although it was known
at the time that he was going to relieve
General Shafter. and after fcportlng at
army headquarters he took a leave and
toured the East, visiting the Buffalo Kx
posltion and other places of interest. He
started west In time to arrive a few days
before the formal transfer of authority
from General Shafter to himself.
Major General Samuel B. M. Young ar
rived here last evening Under orders to re
lieve Major General Shafter of command
of the Department of California on the
Sfrth inst. He Is at the Occidental with
his two daughters, and there he will re
main until the department has been
turned over to him and General Shafter
has resigned command. Then he Â¦will take
Hp his residence at the- commandant's
house at Fort Mason, the house General
Shafter occupied bo long as commanding
officer of the First Infantry and after

All demands payable out of the common
echool fund shall be filed with the secretary
of the Board of Education, and after they have
been approved by the board they nhall bÂ» fllgnbd
by the prenldent of the board and the- Super
intendent and sent to the Auditor. Bvery per
son In the employ of the School Department
entitled to a BHlury therefrom shall receive a
warrant for the amount due nnd approved by
tho board. nlgnptl by the prenl<]ent and secre
tary thereof. Tho entire monthly salary roll
of the ' department Khali be mncio up by the
â¢erretary of tho board;. and after being duly
audited by the Flnanco Committee thereof nnd
approved by u majority of all tho members of
the board shall be Indorsed In the same man
ner as other demand*. .
' While the language of tho section seems
to necessitate tho elgiyiture of tho Super
intendent to all demands it makes a dis
tinction in the case of salary warrants
and excludes him from auditing, them.
Had this fact been known some months
ago endless litigation' over the demands of
employes in tho .school repair shops
would have been avoided. The employes
were unable to get their pay because Su
perintendent Webster would not Blgn their
warrants. Now the Auditor finds that the
Superintendent's signature is not required.
No doubt when tho facts are brought to
the attention of the Board of Kducation
that body will cheerfully exclude the Su
perintendent from participating in the
execution of salary demands.
The officials of the Auditor's office dis
covered yesterday by a careful reading of
the charter that the signature of the Su
perintendent of Schools need | not be af
fixed to the salary demands, of teachers
and other persons employed by the School
Department. While it has been the custom
In tho past for tho Superintendent . to
countersign the salary demands, Chief
Deputy Auditor William Wells, who is
acting Auditor during his father's
absence, says that the practice has been
pursued under- a wrong interpretation- of
the charter, which "In language plain and
specific provides that only the President
and Secretary of the board aro required to
sign tho demands which are more properly
termed warrants. The section bearing on
the subject follows: "

NEW YORK, June 25.â It became known
to-day that there was a debit balance at
the clearing-house - against the Seventh
National Bank amounting: to $038,000. This
grave rise to rumors that the bank was In
difficulties, and caused other rumors that
other banks were also hampered. The sus
picions were cleared away when Manager
William Sherer of the Clearing-House As
sociation gave out a statement to the ef
fect that all the banks In the association
had met their obligations, and that all
clearing-house sheets had gone through.
William H. Tappan, president of tha
Gallatin National Bank, who was present
at a conference held during the day with
other members of the Clearlng-House As
sociation, made the following statement:
"All the banks have settled their bal
ances satisfactorily. This disposes of all
rumors."
To-night a statement was Riven out by
the officials of the Seventh -National
Bank, In which It was said that tho debit
balance* of the Seventh National Bank
with the clearing-house this morning wu
$333,000 and that this balance was duÂ» to
heavy checking on the part of men con
nected with several large brokerage and
banking hounes. The director* and Â¦tock
holders of the bank convened and at one*
provided ample means for all the business
purposes.
The statement further says that thÂ«
flurry was probably started for Â¦tock-
Jobbing purposes, and that the rumors so
weighed on the mind of President William
H. Klmball of the bank that he tendered!
his resignation, which was accepted and
K. R. Thomas, son of Oeneral Samuel
Thomas, was elected In his place. Oeneral
Thomas Is a director and onÂ© of the heav

TJ. S. Consul Pike of Port Louis. Maur-
itius, has written a charming book upon
this gem of the ocean, the home of Paul
and Virginia.
Color.el Pike, whose Xew York address
is 43 Exchange place, had a curious expe-
rience with coffee and the beverage al-
most cestroj-ed his eyesight.
He says. "Speaking of coffee, my first
Â¦warning against its use was insomnia, fol-
lowed by depression, and despondency.
The nervous system was In such a con-
dition that I could not attend to business,
and to my distress I discovered that my
cyepight was. becoming more and more
Imperfect every day. From my know-
ledge of the symptoms of coffee poisoning,
I concluded to leave off the coffee and
take up Postum Food Coffee in its place.
"The results were astonishing. Gradually
nay eyesight recovered, and the nervous
condition and depressed feeling disap-
peared. I have now been using Postum In
place of coffee for several years and am
ia r>erfect health.
"My family of six persons discarded
coffee some time ago and use Postum. I
would not be without It. It Is" a most
valuable addition to the. breakfast table
end should be in every household."

And It is profitable only because the stock haa
merit Having -merit, we wish the. public to
know It; and that can. be! accomplished only
by presenting to them the facts concerning the
great Montezuma Copper and Coal Mines. It
was Lincoln who said, "You can fool some of
the people all the time and all the people
some of the time, but you can't fool all the
people all the time." Rest assured that If
Montezuma stock lacked merit all the adver-
tising we might do would not make the hosts
of friends the company haa gained in Califor-
nia. The Montezuma mines have been exam-
ined by shareholders, to their entire satisfac-
tion. It offers safe and profitable investment,

Judge Cook, just returned from Santa
Rosa, occupied the bench in Department
12 of the Superior Court yesterday morn
ing: and rapidly disposed of a number of
cases. James Sweeney and Peter Flnni
gan, two ex-convicts, pleaded guilty to a
charge of burglary and were each sen
tenced to fifteen years, the first named in
San Quentln and the last named in Fol
som. On the night of March 9 they
broke into the store of Carl Mannes,
821A Howard street, and stole articles
valued at a few cents. As'they had agreed
to plead guilty the prior convictions
against them were not pressed. In sen
tencing them the Judge remarked that if
he had his way every burglar who en
tered a residence at night when murder
might follow would receive a life sentence.
The prisoners had got the limit, but if
they had gone to trial and been convicted
with the priors against them he would
have imposed the life sentence.
Mrs. Botkin's Case.
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, charged with the
murder of Mrs. Dunning and the sister of
the last named/ Mrs. Deane, was again in
court. By consent the case was continued
till Saturday to be set for the second trial.
The Judge said he understood the defend
ant's attorneys were to apply for a writ
of habeas corpus before the Federal
Courts- and he hoped they would do so
soon. If he was applied to for a writ he
would deny the application so that the
matter could be taken to the higher court
at once. If no writ was applied for before
Saturday, the case would be peremptorily
set and the witnesses would be brought
from Delaware.
The cases of C." H. Merrill and H. A.
Hudson, the two â¢ bunko men who came
from the East to await the arrival of the
Presidential party and were arrested at
the Orpheum charges of grand larceny
for stealing a diamond pin from James A.
Berry of Fresno, were called. When they
were held to answer their attorney ap
plied for a writ of habeas corpus, which
was denied by Judge Cook, but the Judge
remarked that If there was no other evi
dence than that before him he would have
to instruct the jury to acquit when the
cases came up for trial.
Lack of Evidence.
The men had been released on $500 bonds
each and that was the last seen of them.
Yesterday Captain Seymour was called to
the stand and admitted that he had been
unable to procure any further ! evidence
and Assistant, District Attorney Deuprey
asked that the cases be dismissed, which
was so ordered.
Joseph Kearney, known as "Bull"
Kearney, was arraigned on a charge of
burglary for breaking into the store of
Charles Samuels, 535 California street.
There are eight prior convictions against
him and he' pleaded not guilty, but was
given till Saturday to reconsider his plea.
The case of Julia Gonzaleski and Fran
cisco Gardelli, charged with grand larceny
for stealing valuable jewelry from the
residence of Mrs. Catherine Espinosa,
where the woman was employed, was
called and continued till Saturday, when
the defendants will plead. The woman has
already made a confession to the police
and it is expected she will plead guilty
and turn State's evidence against her ac
complice, whom she accuses of leading
her into crime.
Judge Cook : Imposes
Heavy Sentence in
Two Cases.
Mrs. Botkii^'s â¢ Second Trial
Will Be Peremptorily Set

Pence Is Very Reticent.
When questioned after the adjournment
as to the meaning of his remark. Pence
said: â¢ "I do not c.are at this- time to ex
plain the meaning of my statement. I will
â¢Â«ay, however, that we purpose . fighting
this matter to the endâ yes, until hell
freezes over." "
When Pence made his statement on top
of Mrs. Craven's refusal to answer the
allegation, V that the petitioners are the
only children of the deceased, the attor
neys representing the children- and the
executors of decedent's will looked in
terested and they will expectantly await
either- the forthcoming of a child Â¦ with
.Mrs. Craven as its sponsor or an explan
ation by Pence as to the cause which ac
tuated his - suggestive remark and the
stand of his client as stated. .
When the petition for a transfer filed by
Mrs. Craven was 'called for hearing yes
terday morning the majority of attorneys
representing those interested were present
in court. Mrs. Craven was represented
by Lafe and Charles Pence. Charles LÂ».
Fair's interests were in the hands of
Knight & Heggerty and ex-Governor
Budd. Charles S. Wheeler and Reuben H.
Lloyd appeared for Theresa A. Oelrlchs
and Virginia Vanderbilt, and Garret Mc-
Enerney, Robert' Y. Hayne and W. M..
Plerson for the executors.
After a preliminary wrangle between
Charles Pence and Charles J. Heggerty,
Judge Troutt decided to take up the hear
ing of the petition for a transfer prior to
considering the petition of the children
for distribution. Charles Pence then made
a long argument in. support of Mrs. Cra
ven's affidavit that Judge Troutt was
prejudiced against her. .
â¢""Do, you contend. Governor Budd,"
asked Pence, "that you or Judge Troutt.
or any of . us here who sat through the
ninety days -of the recent trial,- Is com
petent to try without bias the same issues
when presented in another proceeding?"
Counsel Grow Sarcastic.
"I'll admit," said Budd, "that no sane
man who sat in this court during the re
cent trial could ever believe that Mrs.
Craven was the widow of James G. Fair."
"Budd's $100,000 contract prejudices
him." remarked an attorney.
"Well," answered Budd, "you will never
be prejudiced by any money you ever got
or 'ever will get out of this estate.".
This exchange of repartee closed the
morning session.. At the opening of the
afternoon session Lafe Pence argued in
favor of the motion for a transfer and
Charles S. Wheeler closed the argument
for. the opposition.
Judge Troutt held that there had been
no showing made by those who urged the
transfer, "for," said the court, "though I
have decided that Mrs. Craven ls not the
Â¦widow of the deceased that does not con
stitute or establish .- prejudice ' upon my
part. In my opinion the statute support
ing a transfer on the ground of prejudice
refers to personal prejudice alone,- and
the act of a court in deciding adversely to
the claims of a litigant does not. In my
opinion, show prejudice upon the part of
the court toward the party adversely, af
fected by the- decision. Therefore the mo
tion for a transfer will be denied." ~
.Pence noted an exception to -the ruling
of the court. The hearing then proceeded
upon the petition for distribution. "Charles
S.' Neil, manager of the Fair estate, was
put on the stand to prove the present
status of the properties in his control.
Incidentally he stated that James G. Fair
left no wife or children other than the
petitioners. His testimony will be sup
plemented by that of a few persona hav
ing intimate knowledge of the affairs of
the dead millionaire and the court will
then construe the trust clause of the will
relating to the. personal property of the
estate, for the distribution of which the
children have petitioned. , .
The trustees, under the will, claim;this
personal property is trust property, and
the children claim that the entire trust
clause in the will of their father fell with
the recent decision of the Supreme Court.
This controversy the court will settle.
Another sensation Is brewing in tl'ie Fair
case. under the'guidance of Mrs. Nettie R.
Cravenâ and her lawyers. An Intimation
of '.what' stay-. be expected In the near fu
ture is * contained in an answer j filed by.
Mrs.' Craven to the petition of Theresa A.
Oelrlchs, .Virginia Vanderbilt arid Charles
L. Fair for distribution to them of the
personal property of- : decedent's estate,
now on hearing before Judge Troutt.
' '-'I have been advised," says Mrs." Craven
in her answer; "that it is nat necessary
for me at this time to answer the allega
tion that Iho^etltlonerp are the only chil
dren of the deceased.''
. This statement at least conveys the im
pression that Mrs. Craven does hot wish
to estop herself of the right to appear In
future as the guardian, if not nearer re
lation, of a child that will claim James
G. Fair as its rather. ' ' ' ' â¢ .
â¢ And jMrs. . Craven's intimation that she
might *attempt to prove that Mrs. Oel
rich:3, Mrs. Vanderbilt and Mr. Fair were
blessed with a brother or sister of half
blood is strengthened . by a remark made
by Charles Pence, one of her attorneys,
during the hearing befo;e JtRTge Troutt
yesterday of Mrs. Craven's petition for a
transfer of * tho â¢ distribution proceedings
to some department of the Superior Court
other than that presided over by Judge
Troutt. -
"We want time in which to prepare our
case," said Perce, "because we purpose
contesting every alelgation . made by the
petitioners in this case.' We purpose con
testing even the allegation made by the
petitioners that they are the only children
of the deceased." ' ,
Attorney Pence Also Lets Fall
. a Remark, but Won't
Mrs. Craven Intimates
That Another Heir Is

estimate of the cost of constructing a
roadway thirty feet wide along the center
line of Van Ness avenue from Bay street
connecting with the pavement now being
laid on North Point street, between Polk
street and Van Ness avenue. The pro
posed improvement was petitioned for by
the North Central Improvement Associa
tion, Draymen's Association and a-num
ber of taxpayers so that the business por
tion of the city may be connected with
the northwestern section and the Presidio.
The City Engineer finds that the pro
posed roadway would require 10,350 square
feet of paving and 690 feet of redwood
curbing. The estimated cost is $2915, but
if the cobbles that are to be removed from
downtown streets can be utilized and tho
roadway constructed to a temporary
grade the cost will be but $558.

MRS. EDA BLANKART FUN
STON, wife of Brigadier. General
Frederick Funston, U. S. A., was
among the arrivals on the trans
port Logan from Manila, j Mrs. â¢
Funston's I sister. Miss Lillian Blankart,
was with her. They were greeted^ by their
mother, i Mrs. Otto Blankart, and were
taken" direct from the transport to Oak
land pier on the Government tug r Mc-
Dowell," whence Mrs. Funston went t% her
parents' residence at 1319 .Tenth avenue,
East Oakland, to remain indefinitely. Ill
health occasioned Mrs. Funston's return
from the 1 Philippines, where she had been
with her husband ever since he went back
to the Islands last year ."as a brigadier
general of volunteers. '
The climate was oppressive, and, after
she had seen her daring spouse win .his
promotion to the regular army because of
his capture ot . Agulnaldo. Mrs. Funston
turned homeward in search of the bracing
air of the California Coast.
For a year Mrs. Funston had been, with
her husband at his headquarters in San
Ysidro, 100 miles from Manila, where,
with his forces, the dashing young Kan
san had been meeting remarkable success
In inducing the surrender of insurgent
forces which had been under arms in. his
district. It was during one of his expe
ditions that the documents which gave
the clew to the hiding place of Aguinaldo
In the far away mountains were found on
insurgent officers who had laid down their
arms. â¢ '
Then and there General Funston con
ceived the plan of capture which proved
so successful.- And the brave little Oak
land woman who had sacrificed comfort
and home to be at the front with ,her
lighting husband was the 41rst one to lis
ten to his ambitious project as they sat
together in the quiet of Ysidro's camp.
"And you want to know how the plans
Â¦were made?" queried Mrs. Funston to-day
at the Blankart residence.
Funston Consults His Wife.
"After the papers were taken General
Funston Immediately began to scheme
upon the possibility of*Agulrialdo's cap
ture. My husband . talked a great deal
with me about his plans,- and he: Im
pressed me with the hazardous features,
but I did not have to be told that. I
realized as weir as he did the risk that
was involved.
"After we had talked many times and
gone all over the situation, he asked me
flatly:
" 'Do you want me to go?'
'"Do you want to go?' I asked, a bit;
evasively, but after all I was willing he*
should make the attempt.' It was a des
perate undertaking, but I had to feel that
I should be only; an encouragement and
not a hindrance to the possible successful
culmination of the.. plans. Â¦ _,_
"After it . had â¢ been .wpll-f raraed in ; his
mind. General- Funston. made a trip to'
Manila, He, laid the scheme before his
immediate superior. General Wheaton,
who 'approved it.,' and 'then submitted the
proposition to General MacArthur. After
his permission had been secured, General
Funston returned to Ysidro and then I
went to Manila with him to await the re
sult of the expedition, which -left ; on the
Vicksburg." ,â¢ ' - -. Â» ...- â¢
"Was there opposition" to your husband's
undertaking?" was asked. â¢ - "

Forty-Fourth District.
The Republican Primary League, free of
cliques and factions. Is the center of
political activity in San Francisco. The
league has no candidates | to boom. The
main purpose of the organization is to
awaken the public to a sense of the im
portance of primary elections, to the end
that men of character and intelligence
may be elected as delegates to the mu
nicipal nominating conventions. In every
district of San Francisco there are in
dications of Republican activity. Citizens
are coming- together to discuss municipal
affairs, and the result of the agitation will
be an immense Republican vote at the pri
maries.
Democratic voters, noted for docile ad
hesion to boss rule and party discipline,
will occasionally, permit a State Central
Committee to step in and take control of
local affairs, but Republicans as a rule
are so independent that they will not sub
mit to such intrusion: Democratic news
papers known tg be in sympathy if not
alliance with Republican bosses are very
much concerned at this time over the
growing strength arid power of the Re
publican Primary League. Politicians are
importuned Â¦ to step in I and establish
counter organizations. The scheme to
provoke discord' in Republican ranks is
clumsy, to say the least. Only the
gudgeons will take the - bait. âSensible
men of the Republican party who are
looking forward to Republican success in
the next State campaign will join in ef
forts to establish harmony and secure
Republican victory in the municipal cam
paign this year.. . . " Â¦
The framers of the charter fancied that
the interests of San Francisco would .be
protected by separating-* the municipal
election from the contest for State officers.
This year citizens will vote for men to
govern .the city. Next year they will vote
for men to govern the State. The Repub
lican /taxpayers of San expect
to regulate local affairs without advice or
dictation from State or Federal office-seek
ers. The Republicans of the city ..are or
ganizing their forces in a sensible fashion,
and expect to place San j Francisco as a
municipality under Republican rule. They
do not expect -resistance from men who
are supposed or avowed candidates for
the favor of the Republican State Con
vention of 1902. It would be short sighted
politics on the part of outsiders" to inter
fere in the local concerns of San Fran
cisco Republicans.

CREDITORS WANT
THEIR INTEREST
Unwilling to Sign a Clear
Receipt for Face Value
of Claims.
It was finally -decided, after a long dis
cussion.- to submit the matter to con
sideration by' the Joint Committee on
Finance and: Judiciary. A meeting "will
be arranged for a later date, at which
the City Attorney will be present, to dis
cuss tbe leg-al phases of the Question aft
er the Interested creditors have explained
their case.
The attorneys of â¢ the merchant credi
tors of the city appeared yesterday be
fore the Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors and officially- notified the
members thereof that their clients would
positively refuse to waive interest on
their back claims. While* the board has
appropriated the sum of $12,000 to pay in
terest on teachers' claims, Â¦ no provision
has been made in the- tax budgret to pay
Interest ont merchants' claims, although
the "ionstitutional amendment adopted at
me last election provides for the payment
of interest on all claims of certain back
years.
The merchant creditors were represent
ed by Attorneys . Thomas D. Rlordan,
Frank Powers. J. C. Bates and Walker
Graves. While they offered no objection
to paying interest to the teachers, they
expressed themselves as being opposed to
signing a clear receipt for the Â£ace value
of the claims. In other words, they de
eired that some plan be formulated so
that the claims for interest would oper
ate as a lien for.the amount due them.
Supervisors Hotaling and Jennings, as
members of the T committee, could not see
their way clear to accept "a partial re-,
ceipt on behalf of the city for the face
value cf the claims. They refused to rec
ommend to thes board that the payment
of interest be left as a legacy to the suc
ceeding ZSoard, as suggested by the attor
neys. , . :
