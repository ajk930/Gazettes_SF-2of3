The Fleming brothers assert that from

statement that the story told by the
Fleming brothers is authentic and that it

conclusion provoked â¢ a double apprecia
tion. He said in part:
I am sure that every one within sound of
my voice will Join In congratulating my
brother, the Bishop of California, in the suc
cess of this great meeting. One thing he has
forgotten, a megaphone, but fortunately for
you it will constrain the speakers to be very
brief.
The remarkable change In the relations of
the United States to the Far East have led
men to look to the relations of Christianity to
other religions. We must recognize that sit
uation. No one who knows pagan lands can
be Insensible to the fact that In the books of
these old religions there is something of good.
Our Anglo-Saxon Christianity has a message
to the pagan world that no other Christianity
ever has had. The triumph is that God has
given to Anglo-Saxon Christianity a distinct
adaptability of turning civilizations of
heathendom to a civilization of the Anglo-
Saxon.
I wonder If you know how It touches our
imagination when we come here and look out
through the beautiful Golden Gate and far
over the waters and think of that distant land
âthat land where the work Is to be done, work
which in Its results Is far .more golden than all
the wealth of your glorious land. "I will make
a man more precious than gold," the lines
read. \u25a0 .
May God so order that out of your Golden
Gate there shall pour \u25a0 the stream of i some
thing more precious than gold, that shall re
generate that pagan world ' to j the glory of
God and the upbuilding of his kingdom among
men,

REQTTICKENED FAITH

The last speaker, Burton Mansfleld, said
In substance: " â¢-
Somebody has seen fit to say ' that deficit in
this church of ours marks a crisis In its mlsf
slonary work. It is lack of motive .p6wer,
lack of faith In God and In the plan which
he has to redeem the world. It comes largely
from selfish motives." It comes because we as
men \u25a0 demand scientific i proof and hide under
the shadow . of evolution. God himself has a
plan of evolution.
The world moves and the church must move
with it. We mark time too muoh. This church
Is losing too much time. "We need a re

The House of Deputies in the afternoon
session did not accept the amendment by
which new dioceses may be formed un
der certain conditions. The chief objec
tion to the amendment was that It took
the power of forming new dioceses out of
the hands of the General Convention.
The report of the joint commission on
the marginal readings on the Scriptures
was presented and accepted, similar ac
tion having been previously taken by the
House of Bishops.
The House of Bishops discussed the sub
ject, of marriage and divorce, but took
no action. They will vote on this im
portant question this morning. News of
the death of the venerable Bishop Burgee
of Quincy was received with sorrow. A
telegram of sympathy was sent to a
daughter of the deceased. Nominations
to fill the Bishopric of Olympia and North
Dakota were made and a vote will prob
ably be taken to-day.
The changed vote upon reconsideration
did not comprise all of the sensation. It
developed that the secretary had made a
mistake in recording Monday's vote and
that the amendment was really defeated
on that day instead of being adopted.
Monday's vote on the amendment was
extremely close. One diocese could sway
the balance either way. When the secre
tary concluded reading the mlnute3 yes
terday morning Rev. Dr. Williams of Ne
braska claimed that the vote of his dio
cese had been wrongfully recorded; that
instead of voting for the measure, aa
stated by the secretary, the clerical and
lay delegates of that diocese voted against
It. There- was a deal of discussion over
the move to change the vote and after
motion upon motion had been made, laid
on the table, carried or defeated, a second
vote was taken, with the result that the
amendment was defeated.

UP MISSIONARY WORK
In substance the Lord Bishop of New
castle said:
I shall plunge into my subject. First of all.
what Is our object In the mission work? It
means that our Master has charged us to bring
the mesnage of Jesus Christ to everybody in this
world. It means that we are to found a
branch of that society which he himself
founded.
We are told that it Is the rood pleasure of
God to make known on earth the manifold
wisdom of God through the church. I We all
have our contributions to make. Aa the reli
gion of Christ Is made known, so Is God's
wisdom made known.
I find a passage in which my Master by his
crucifixion and resurrection spread a gospel
which should teach all mankind. I find a paa
eagre which says: "Lo, I am with you alway,
even unto the end of the world." I find alBO
"Go, make disciples of all people of the
earth." We are determined to make known
this salvation and plant in^every country the
societies our Master directed.
There are four methods of doing; this. First,
the evangelistic, and when I spÂ«ak of evangel
istic work I want to ask your sympathy and
admiration, for the work is severe and trying.
Secondly, the educational. If this world Is
V> be won to Christ it I* not to 'be won by
Americana anl- English alone. The Chinese
and all others must be enlisted and all that
Is best of the native must be brought Into the
ranks. Missions must be undertaken by the
natives themselves.
Thirdly, the^medlcal. This Is a branch that
has not always had Justice done to it. , '
Fourthly, the magnetic. I mean that besides
the evangelistic, the educational and the.medi
cal work "there is still another Important as
pect. It la that the society should attract the
Individual. The influence of the individual
must be followed by the Influence of the so
ciety. It Un't always the Influence of the
society. This missionary work Isn't simply to
bo done abroad, not depending alone on our
work here. They are dependent upon one
another. I aÂ«k that this gathering to-night
should express what our missionary work la in
the heart and soul.

spacious hall as the choirs marched in

addresses, the first of which was by the
distinguished English Bishop, introduced
by Bishop Doane.
ELEMENTS THAT MAKE

this coast. The gathering \u25a0was Just a
part and parcel of the big Episcopal
convention programme, but it was a sig
nal religious affair and one that will not
easily bo effaced from the memory of
those who attended.
At one and the same time were fath
ered on the same platform the Bishops
end minor clergymen of the Episcopalian
denomination who have made the pulpits
of, England and America resound with
their eloquence. And at least three world
famous Bishops took part in this public
missionary meeting. The Right Rev

the distant rafters ar.d great epaccs of
tlie pavilion. The church restriction to
applause was removed and all the speak
er* received round after round of hand-
Clappln? during and at the conclusion of
their addresses.
FAMOUS PRELATES
ON" THE PLATFORM
To Bishop Doane was entrusted the
work of direction. Under his leadership
the prayers were read. Wallace Babin
conducted the hymnal music of band and
choirs, of which there were nine from
the various Episcopal churches of Ban
Francisco. Choir boys and young women
and young men, dressed in the surplice.
Eat in parallel rows on each side of the
extended platformâ the game that was
not long since crowded with civic and
military authorities brought U.Â£ether to
pay devotional' respects to the memory
of a dead a President. With the united
choirs was the concourse of people,
standing, singing, praying.
Of the four speakers of the evening
three were prelates and one lay. The
Lord Bishop of Newcastle, logical, concise
and analytic, gave a careful exposition of
his subject. Then came Bishop Potter,
sure o'f himself and dignified, wasting not
a word and closing his address with a fine
bit of imaginative word/ painting. He was
followed by the earnest, fervent Bishop
Partridge, who is fresh from missionary
work in the Orient. Burton Mansfleld, the
lay speaker of the evening, was the last
on the programme, and he concluded with
a call for help, financial and spiritual.

Robert E. Withers of South Virginia re

Stetson said:
It is not impracticable to change It at a sub
sequent meeting. â¢ The object of reading the
minutes is to correct that report until it is con
firmed by the body and until then it is no re
port. Every delegation has a right to demand
the right to have its vote recorded as given.
This motion presents a question of the very
highest constitutional importance. A vital
change In the constitution of this chufch should

tution.. It 1s of. the greatest importance that
a vote of this kind should be announced at

The Rev. Dr. Oberly explained that
there was no discussion In the committee
on the prayer book in regard to the mat

both of clerical and lay deputies, to ex

sibly by vote on the question of a change
of the name of the church.' There should
â¢be the largest liberty of debate, and with
that in view the minority had adopted

consecrated or assigned thereto shall for the ad
ministration of his jurisdiction select the con
stitution and canons of this church, which shall
remain ln force so far as applicable to the cir
cumstances of said missionary district, except
so far as altered from time to time with the

Bishop may, however, at any time submit to
the House of Bishops a draft of a proposed con

by the Houjo of Bishops, shall so into effect

House of Bishops.
The matter was on motion referred to
the committee on canons.
A deputy proposed as an amendment
the following:
In cases where the prayer book has not been
translated Into the language of the congrega
tion provision may be made by canon for the
temporary use of other forms and directories of
worship by congregations not in union with this
church, who are willing to accept the spiritual

HIS CHURCH WABDEN
ATTENDS TO BUSINESS
Rev. C. E. Cooper, M. A., rector of St,
Paul's Church, Nanaimo, B. C, and Rural
Dean, was next introduced and spoke
briefly, saying among other things:
I feel that it is the. greatest honor that the
Primate of all Canada has put on me in ap
pointing me a delegate to this great conven
tion. And T want to say that he could not
have found any one better disposed toward the
American church, or in a certain sense better
qualified to do so. not from any personal gifts,
but it la from the benefits that I have received
from the American church. I am not speak
ing of the hospitality, bounteous though It Is,
! with which we have been received, because
the Americans are everywhere proverbial for i
their hospitality and we have come to expect
nothing else, but. I mean for the benefits that
I have received in my own parish, because I
have a church warden who is an American
citizen and the son of an American clergyman,
an ardent patriot, a loyal and devoted church
man who does what Is, I may say, rare on our
side of the line, perhaps not very common any
whereâ he places all of his business ability, of
which Americans have so much, at the dis
posal of the church and uses all the keenness,
all the knowledge of detail, all the business
habits that he has In the service of the church.
Justice Harrison of the Supreme Court
of Victoria, the layman of the deputation,
was next introduced. He spoke In part as
follows: . .
I have the honor and' the great pleasure of
joining in the pleasing duty which devolves
en the deputation of conveying 1 to the Ameri
can church the good wishes of the Canadian
church. And as British people we feel it only
light and proper to express that feeling that
we Britishers have toward your people of
friendship and good will, and - also the heart
felt sympathy that* we feel with your people

tained in the death by assassination of your

less in the judgment of the minister It shall
be Impracticable to obtain such witnesses.
Every minister shall without delay formally
record In the proper register the name, age and

signed by the minister who perform^ the cere

No minister shall solemnize a marrlasre be

living; unless the former marriage was an
nulled by a decree of some civil court of com
petent Jurisdiction for cause existing before
such former marriage.
Fourth Section Causes Warm Debate.
The first three sections seemed to be
satisfactory to a majority of the mem
bers, but it was. on the fourth section that
a warm debate was had. The question
discussed was as to whether the church
should forbid the innocent party in a di
vorce for infidelity to remarry. A further
discussion will be held to-day. Canon 37
of the discipline of persons marrying after
divorce will also be debated. It is aa fol
lows: â¢ ;â¢-â¢
No person divorced for cause arising after
marriage, and marrying again during the lfte
tlme of the other party to the divorce, nor any
person marrying a person so divorced, shall
be admitted to baptism or confirmation, or be
permitted to receive the holy communion, ex
cept 'when penitent, and. If the other party to
the subsequent marriage be then living, when
separated from such other party, or when peni
tent and in immediate danger of death; but
this provision shall not apply to the innocent
party to a divorce for the cause of adultery.
No person shall be denied baptism or con
firmation or the holy communion under this
canon until after the minister shall have given
to the person due and sufficient notice of such
intended denial, and of the right of appeal
At the afternoon session the Bishops
took up the question of marriage and di
vorce. The discussion was over canon 3S
of the solemnization of matrimony. It is
as follows:
The solemnization of matrimony In this
church Is a service In which the mutual con
sent of the parties entering Into this state of
life is given In the presence of a minister, who.
having pronounced them in the Name of tha
Holy Trinity to be man and wife. Invokes the
divine blessing upon their union.
In the solemnization of matrimony the min
isters of this church shall be careful to ascer
tain and to observe the law of the State gov
erning the civil contract of marriage in the
place where the service shall be performed.
No minister shall solemnize the marriage of
any person, who under the law of the place of
marriage Is not free to marry without the
consent of parent or guardian, unless the par
ent or guardian of such minor Is present and
consenting, or shall have given written con
sent to the marriage, or is permanently resi
dent In a foreign country.

Rev. Dr. W. W. Case, who recently re
turned from an extended trip through the
Holy Land, addressed a large gathering
at Grace Methodist Episcopal Church last
night upon the subject of "Palestine." Dr.
Case related the principal incidents of his
journey to the historic scenes familiar to
students of biblical history.
He described In a graphic manner the
old city of Jerusalem, with its five hills
and four squalid and filthy quarters. He
spoke of David's tomb, which Christians
may view but never enter: of the Church
of the Holy Sepulcher marking the tradi
tional site of Christ's crucifixion and bur
ial; of the stone of unction where Christ
lay when he was annointed; of the sus
pended rock of Enoch which shows his
footprint, as well as that of Mohammed;
of the garden of Gethsemanle, where
Christ wrought out the salvation of men;
of the Coptic Church, which is a veritable
dungeon, but a place of refuge for pil
grims whose lives are constantly sought
by the Mohammedans, and of the man
ers and customs of the modern populace.
The relation of numerous anecdotes of the
journey to and from Palestine served to
render the address enjoyable as well as

eettled and qualified as above provided.
WESTERN" TEXAS MAKES
PLEA FOE A DIOCESE
The Rev. H. Stuck of Texas asked that
the amendment be rejected. He pleaded
for Western Texas, which had worked
hard to become a diocese, but which was
unable to comply with the new canon
\u25a0which stipulated that a missionary dis
trict must have six self-supporting par
ishes before it could become a diocese
He told of the wide area of Western
Texas, which was, however, more flour
ishing- than many of the dioceses repre
sented in the convention.
Deputy Saunders of Massachusetts said
that the amendment had many radical
defects, and he also hoped for "its rejec
tion. The spf-aker laid stress on the fact
that under the proposed amendment the
formation of new dioceses was taken out
of the hands of the General Convention,
and that it should be defeated for this
reason alone.
Deputy Packard of Maryland and Major
Fairbanks of Florida also spoke on the'
Fubject and the Rev. Frank Page of Texas
made a stirring appeal for the missionary
district of the western part of his State.
He said that the amendment was not fair
nor just and that it prevented the forma
tion of a wide field as a diocese after its
clergy had worked hard for a desired end.
Speeches were made* by the Rev. Dr.
Fulton and the Rev. Dr. Lewis of Penn
sylvania and Judge Stiness of Rhode.Isl
and. The amendment was lost when put
to a. vote.

question of the marginal readings to the

publication and use by the clergy In the
pulpit.
PRESENTS REPORT ON
THE MARGINAL READINGS
The Rev. Dr. Joseph Carey of Albany,
representing the joint commission reap
polnted at the last convention to prepare
the marginal readings, then presented the
report of the commission. The speaker
eaid that all the members of the commis
sion had agreed on the alterations and
readings and felt that a clearer under
standing would be given to readers of the
Scriptures. He stated that an offer had
been received from the King's printers
in England to print two editions of the
marginal readings without cost to the
American church. The speaker dwelt
upon the magnitude of the work of the
commission, and then offered the follow
ing resolution:
Resolved, That the marginal readings of
the English \-erslon of the Old and New
Testaments reported to this house by the joint
commission appointed in 1S95 and reappointed
In 1S9S to make such report be published un

Board of Foreign Missions to a reception
at the mission house next Tuesday after
noon from 2 to 5. Some discussion was
had as to the proper manner of accepting
the invitation.
The house then adjourned until this
morning'.
The Rev. Dr. David H. Greer of New
York moved that further action on the
amendment be postponed until a report
upon the proposed constitution is re
ceived from the House of Bishops. The
speaker said that it might be necessary
for the two houses to appoint conference
committees to deliberate ypon points on
which the two bodies might differ. The
motion of the Rev. i^r. Greer was carried
and the consideration of the amendment
went over.

Continued on Page Five.
Chairman Lindsay read a < protest from
eeveral members, who objected to the con
tinued conversation carried on in the
house by various deputies. DrÂ» Lindsay
appealed to th-i delegates.to refrain from
this annoying habit, as tnere were many
delegates who were In attendance to at
tend to business.
The Rev. Mr. Hickman of Colorado of
fered a resolution asking that certain
words In Article 8 of the Constitution be
striken out and others substituted. It was
referred to the committee.
The Rev. Dr. McKim of Colorado de
sired to have the subject of "Capital and
Labor" taken up at this time, it being
11:30 a. m., the hour set for its discussion.
Mr. Lewis of Pennsylvania, a member
of the committee on the dispatch of busi
ness, objected to Its being- brought up out
of' order. He said it ought to take its
place on the calendar. This course was
followed.
Resolved, That, In the adoption of article 10
of the constitution. It is the purpose and un
derstanding of this house that the several por
tions and offices of the Book of Common
Prayer specified in said article shall be used
in accordance with the terms set forth in said
book.
a resolution asking that a diocese be es
tablished in the Philippines.
The Rev. Dr. Restarick of San Diego
suggested that under article 6 of the
constitution the House of Deputies had no
authority to pass such a resolution; that
the matter \u25a0was entirely in the jurisdiction
of the House of Bishops.
Mr. Morgan then asked that the resolu
tion be referred to the House of Bishops
by the House of Deputies.
A lay delegate from Missouri rose to a
point of order. He said the convention
was engaged in adopting a new constitu
tion; that the house was created and de
rived all its powers from the constitution
under which the deputies were acting. He
said it had begun its work under it "and
would continue and end its work under
that constitution. Its duties under the
constitution, which gave it birth, gave it
Its powers. He claimed that the new con
stitution had not as yet been adopted and
could not become the organic law of this
body until both houses had passed upon,
every section embraced and therefore the
reference of the motion was out of order.
Chairman Lindsay did not take this
view and ruled accordingly. Banker Mor
gan then renewed his motion that the
committee on new business present the
resolution to the House of Bishops.
Judge Stiness of Rhode Island sug
gested that the House of Deputies should
present Mr. Morgan's resolution to the
House of Bishops.
A clerical deputy offered an amendment
to the New York lay delegate's motion
that 'the memorial relating to the epis
copacy in the Philippine Islands be re
called from the committee on new busi
ness and that it be referred to the House
of Deputies. Mr. Morgan apcepted the
amendment and it became the original
motion and was adopted.

The Rev. Dr. Pentreath, Archdeacon of
Columbia and Kootenay, was next Intro
duced and made an eloquent speech of ten
minutes' - length, in the course of which
he said:
\u25a0 I- esteem it a great honor that we have been
deputed to bear the greetings of the â¢ General
Synod of . the church in' Canada to this joint
convention meeting for the first time in the
city: of San - Francisco in the dawn of the
twentieth century, . with : all its possibilities be
fore us and before you. We men of the north
ern zone may differ . from you politically, per
haps we' have some different Ideals; in the
hearts and in the minds of our people to-day
there are the strivings after imperial unity and
the consolidation of the British" empire. But
when -it comes to the old historic church and
the ancient faith we do not know any forty-
I was allowed officially to visit San Francisco
the first time two years ago, when I took part
in the consecration of Bishop Moreland to the
Diocese of Sacramento. In the short time that
I was here I made many friends, and it la a
pleasure to be allowed to come back again to
see them. But it is in a wider way than that
altogether that I stand upon this platform this
morning. We are essentially a Western
deputation. Unfortunately to-day while we
have no representative whatever from the
Kastern part of Canada, in a certain way per
haps it is fitting that, meeting in this, which
is, I am constantly reminded not by any means
the westernmost city of the United States of
America, but, as my geography has been set
right, is actually the central city of the whole
states so far as East and West are concerned,
yet, still It Is proper that we of the West
should be here to-day to represent the great
church of Canada. AVe bring to you the heart
iest" greeting from the Archbishop - of Rupert
Land, the Primate of Canada, and I am sure
from the whole of the Bishops, clergy and laity
of the church in the Dominion. We feel that
we need indeed to experience, and realize our
unity with this great church of the United
States of America. And speaking especially
here in the West, it seems to me, from my
seven or \u25a0 eight years experience that there is
"i^othing that will really meet the needs of fcur
people in the West except the position of the
church that is represented here within these
walls. We. go back to our work, difficult In
deed as it-is, compared perhaps with that of
some, who work in large towns, especially the
work of the men who have to labor in the
sparsely settled districts, is to say the least
of it, hard; but to go. back as some \u25a0â¢ have to in
in Western 'and mid-Western dioceses without
the financial support that they ought to receive
from the wealth of the East. If sometimes we
are Inclined to despond and to despair and al
most to give up the condition of hopelessness
that, confronts us, we realize to-day our union
with you all from east to west, and from north
to south still in this great continent of America
and we heartily thank you on behalf of the
Bishops of Canada for the reception that you
have given us; it is for our inspiration and
for a rising to a higher conception of what our
duty ' shall be that we shall go back, please
God, to our work from this joint convention in
San Francisco. .

DEPUTATION FROM
CANADA INTRODUCED
Dividedâ Clerical, 4, lay, 4. â¢
An effort was made to have the vote on
the Huntington resolution postponed. The
Rev. Mr. Hodges tried to have the discus
sion on the amendment reopened. He
seemed to be under the impression that
the reconsideration of the vote gave him
the privilege of asking further questions.
The Rev. Dr. pulton arose to a point of
order and shut off further discussion by
saying his motion was simply to recon
sider the vote and nothing else. The chair
ruled accordingly. - ,

IN A SAIiOOX BRAWL
The witness had not concluded his testi
mony when the court, at 4 p. m., adjourned
for the day. ~ ; . " . .
Admiral Dewey. speaking for the court, then
said that as there were no legal obstacles In
the way of putting the question it could be
asked. Lieutenant Bristol said In reply
â¢â¢I do not agree with Captain Folger a's re
1 ? Â£? e ,v act tv that the 8hl P s were nearer In
at night than they were in the day time be
cause it 19 my firm reoollectlon now that 'they
were farther out at night than they were In
the day time; also I read. from the log when
I testified that the average revolutions of the
Texas by the watch "were a certain number
The revolutions, according to that, give the
ship a certain speed, which would be-greater
than the distance given by Captain Folger be
cause we also stated In that log that* we
steamed for two hours and turned first to the
east and then to the west."
When Mr. Hanna had taken his Â«eat Mr
Raynor replied, referring to Mr, Hanna as hU
"learned and solemn friend." This charae
te r.^ lo . n 1 br Â° u *!} t .^P^ 1 , 11 hla feTt..
,. Thls -h e said, "is eminently improper. All
these left-handed compliments thrown around
Mr. Raynorâ I withdraw It.
Mr. Hannaâ It did not make me feel solemn.
Mr. Raynorâ I would not object to your call
ing me solemn. .
Captain Lemly-You are not aolemri: I call
you funny. (Laughter.) - CttU
(UushtoT" 1 don't call you at all funny.
Mr. Raynor then questioned the witness aa
to the stay of the flying squadron at Clenfue
?Â£*: .? he latter Bald he nad not considered
that they maintained a blockade there
"We were merely lying off that port." ha
said, 'and at night anything could have passed
in, so far as we were concerned."
Mr. Raynor then undertook to compare the"
estimate of the distances which Commodore
fcchley's fleet went to the east and west of
Santiago harbor with that of Captain Folder
Mr. Hanna .suggested that the practice of quot
ing from the testimony of former witnesses,
while not objectionable from a legal point of
ylew waa calculated to produce delay and
therefore not desirable.
"I do not believe Mr. Hodgson took an ac
curate observation. I don't want to make
that positive statement, but I do want toSnake
the statement of what I know in regard to
the Instrument. The Instrument as I use It
is accurate at lower ranges and Inaccurate at
higher ranges." \ . -.."-
Mr. Raynorâ Is It possible for the stadlmeter
to have made a mistake of 2000 yards? Don't
you think if that is the case you would better
abolish that Instrument? .
"Is It Inaccurate under 4000 yards V
"It is more accurate under 4000 yards, but
If the instrument has not been corrected re
cently it la likely to err."
"The stadimeter at 4000 yards and over Is
well known to be Inaccurate for measuring dis
tances, because the gradations are so close to
gether that a small error in observation makes
a large error In the result."
Mr. Raynorâ And those are the reasons you
give now for accounting for this wide di
vergence? You do not think the etadimeter
Is as accurate as It ought to|}>e?
"Those are the reasons I have always had
in my mind for not reconciling those two state
ments. Another reason for thinking myself
right was the speed of the ship, which was
given me as half-speed. Take it at full speed
at her Initial position and she could not ar
rive at a certain point which would give her
that range, 1400 yards."
Mr. Raynorâ Then the stadimeter Is not to
be relied upon at all in comparison with your
observations, as I understand It. in this In
stance?
The Inaccurate Stadimeter .
"A range of 1400 yards at the time of the
turn of the Brooklyn Is absolutely irrecon
cilable. My idea is that a stadimeter at 4000
yards is not an accurate instrument and that
is . what they state \u25a0 they took the measure
ments with it. Also in smoke of battle it Is al
most impossible to take ranges accurately.
It was a good deal of an estimate. Also I
have heard I do not know how true It is, the
ranges on board the Brooklyn were taken by
ftn enlisted man. I do not question the en
listed man's accuracy except that I would
think an officer's accuracy would be greater
than that of an enlisted man."
"Then those two statements are perfectly Ir
reconcilable?"
Lieutenant Bristol then detailed the part
the Texas played in the battle, giving the
details of the chase up the Cuban coast. De
scribing the close of that pursuit he said:
"We continued on with the chase of the
Colon, which was then ahead of the Vlscaya,
in the same relative* positions, the Brooklyn,
Oregon, Texas and. afterward at the end of the
chase, -the New York joined in it. I forgot to
mention that the Vixen was outside the Brook
lyn at this time and along at the time the
Vlscaya sheered inside and kept about abreast
of uÂ« until we overhauled her and went ahead,
until the Colon finally turned inshore and
hauled down her flag. The Texas then Joined
the rest of the ships at the prize and remained
there that night."
Mr. Hanna inquired: "From the position you
occupied during the chase could you or not
determine which of tha vessels was leading?"
"I could with the distinctness with which
the ships could be seen, not the positions."
"What did you estimate as their relative
positions?"
"That was obtained comparatively. The dis
tance to the Colon was from about three and
aÂ»half miles to four miles, up to five or six
miles, at the end of the chase. She drew
away from us slowly. The Brooklyn and Ore
gon were considerably closer to ua than the
Colon. The Oregon was closer than the Brook
lyn, bo that the Brooklyn was leading aa re
gards the distance from us that she waa out
on our bow."
- In response to questions by Mr. Raynor
Lieutenant Bristol said that he had made his
chart because of his Interest In the battle and
that he had prepared It a few days after the
battle, and stated that "to the best of my
knowledge and belief the chart in right." . . \u25a0.
Mr. Raynor called attention to the fact that
the witness had said at the beginning of the
battle the Brooklyn was heading \u25a0 north and
east, while Lieutenant Commander Hodgson,
who had been aboard thÂ«r~Brooklyn, had said
the vessel was heading north and' west.
"Which is right?" he asked.
"I believe I am right," the witness replied.
"You can't both be right."
"That is right, too."
In response to further questions, Lieutenant
Bristol said his ' chart had been stored away
for some time, but that previously he had
had several blue prints made of it.
At Mr. Raynor' s request the witness made
measurements showing that according to his
chart at the beginning of the fight off San
tiago the nearest Spanish ship to the Brook
lyn was 1300 yards. Mr. Raynor asked:
How can you reconcile that with the state
ment of Lieutenant Commander Hodgson that
the range at the time of the turn of the
Brooklyn was 1400 yards?" \u25a0'\^- -\u25a0'
'*I cannot reconcile my statement with that
of Lieutenant â¢ Commander Hodgson."

"She was about aa far out on our port bow,
relatively speaking, as the Spanish ships were
on our starboard bow."
"Had she completed the turn at that time?"
\u25a0 "I do not ' know. She did not make any
turn after that and always kept on to the
westward. At that time I did not know any
thing about a turn."
"You did not see what Is known as the loop?"
"I did not."
Chase by the Texas.
The witness described the engagement of
July 3. saying that the Spanish fleet had come
cut only sufficiently far to clear the shoal
near th<i mouth of the harbor before turning
to the westward. He did not think this was
to exceed 1500 yards out from Caysmith, which
is inside the harbor.
Lieutenant Bristol said that after the en
gagement began he went below and fired three
shots from the 12-lnch guns. When he came
on deck the first of the Spanish ships waa
going ashore.
"We were then," he said, "headed to the
westward, with the enemy's ships running close
along a point seven miles west of Santiago."
"Did you see the Brooklyn when you came
on deck?"
"I did."
"Where was she at that time?"
suddenly appeared, what orders had you to
meet 6uch a contingency?"
"No orders, were turned over to me In regard
to a contingency of that kind," replied the
witness.
"As watch officer, should you have had such
orders?"
"I should have had."
Lieutenant Bristol then spoka of the Spanish
shore batteries, sayincr:
"I \u25a0 personally examined them the day we ar
rived there and satisfied myself that the bat
teries amounted to nothing."
Lieutenant Bristol said that'on the morning
of July 3 he had fixed the position of the
Texas and also generally of the other ships
of the fleÂ«t and had. prepared a chart showing
theso positions. He considered the Initial po
sition assigned to the Texas, the Brooklyn and
the Iowa as accurate.
Commander Wainwrlght was then excused,
and Lieutenant M. L. -Bristol, former watch
and division officer of the Texas, was called.'
He had only related the arrival of 'the, Texas
at Cienfuegos . and detailed conditions, there
when the court took a .recess for ' luncheon.
Bristol continued his testimony at the afternoon
session of the court. Speakingr^of the blockade
of Cienfuegos, he sald.he had observed the elg
nal lights on. the shore near Cienfuegos, but
had not understood their significance. -The wit
ness also described the .blockade off Santiago.
Hanna here asked the witness:
"If the vessels of the Spanish equadron had
Mr. Raynor asked if It was true as had
been officially stated' in the report, that the
positions were assigned from "known bear
ings?" "The witness replied that that state
ment wa.3 Incorrect;, that they were established
by estimated bearings. Most of the positions
were, he said, fixed by discussions among the
navigators constituting the board, although
Captain Chadwlck was before thÂ© board. The
navigators had done the best they could in
platting the vessels and had made It as nearly
correct as possible, so long after the engage
ment, as had been stated by the board.
Asked by Raynor about the places assigned
to the Brooklyn and the Texas, while the
former vessel was making her loop, Com
mander Wainwrlght said he did not consider
them correct.
"For myself," he said, "I was never satis
fied with the places assigned."
He said further that the board had done
the best that they could at the time, an a
board. "It was the best we could do to get all
the members of the board to sign the report,"
be said.
"Who In addition to yourself waa not satis
fied?" asked Raynor.
"I would not like to say," responded the wit
ness. "I know that the navigator of the Texas
was not, for one. I think none was satisfied
except the navigator of the Brooklyn, and I
don't know that he was."
"Bat, notwithstanding, you wero all, includ
ing the navigator of the Brooklyn, dissatisfied,
you signed the report?"
"That is correct."
On redirect examination. Commander Wain
wrlght said that in making the chart all the
members of the board were at liberty to con-'
tribute whatever data they had or to make
whatever arguments they might desire. He also
said that the chart was a compromise of opin
ions. In response to further questions -the wit
ness said he did not see the Brooklyn on the
day of the battle off Santiago. Questions were
put by the court and answered as follows: '
"Were the positions of the ehlps as shown on
the chart in question obtained from testimony
taken by. the board or from a general discus
sion by the members of the board?" â¢
"Almost entirely by general discussion" by
the members or the board. Captain Chadwlck
and Captain Cook appeared end discussed the
matter with the board." ....
"From the position of the Gloucester at the
commencement of the battle of July 3, could
you see both the Brooklyn. and the Texas?"
"I do not remember seeing the Brooklyn and
Texas at the commencement of the battle." '
"What" orders, If any, were signaled by the
Brooklyn to the fleet during the engagement of
July 3?" , â¢ .-:-...
"I saw none."
Raynorâ This does not mean that no signals
were displayed,, does It? " ' .
"No, it does not."
\u25a0 By the courtâ Did any one of the Spanish'
vessels change her course to the southward, aa
if intending to ram one of the fleet? "
"I saw no signs of it." ,.: . - ;.' j

The witness told how conclusions were reached
by the board. He said:
"When I reported as senior member of the
board, the board of navigators had a sketched
chart before them with the number of the po
sitions sketched on it, which had been-deter
mined by them, starting at different periods,
first when the ships came out and afterward
when they went ashore. Each navigator, as
near as possible, would put the position -of his
ship at that time. Then there was a great
deal of discussion as to the relative positions.
Of course It was impossible to get any position
by bearings-- and- there was known
about the relative positions. We also, knew
that the distances In the chart were some
what incorrect and the final decision of the
board was to reconcile each one as near as
possible, but none of the positions was con
sidered exact. The impossibility of getting
bearings even if we had had a correct chart,
was apparent, but It gave a general Idea of the
positions of the vessels during different periods
of the battle."

FAMOTJS OFFICER OF THE NAVY WHO DIRECTED THE OPERATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES FLEET AT
THE GREAT BATTLE OFF SANTIAGO AND WHO WILL RETIRE FROM ACTIVE SERVICE TO-DAY UN
DER THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AGE LIMIT REGULATION.
Lieutenant Commander Hodgson being
cused Commander Wainwrlght was called
Captain Lemly began his examination by
drawing- from the witness the fact -that he
had been a member and latterly senior mem
ber of the board which had officially acted
In making the charts showing the positions of
"I. of course, am very sorry that I ever so
far forgot myeelf as to write a letter containing
such intemperate language. It waa not written
exactly lor publication, but under great provo
cation at the time. In that letter I did not
accuse this newspaper of lying for printing that
statement. In fact. It was to absolve it from
lying that I gave the paper authority to use
my name for the correctness of the gist of that
statement. The lying was on the matter of the
fact that the commodore displayed such trepi
dation and cowardice on the Erooklyn the day
of that battle that he ran from the Spaniards
and took the Brooklyn to the southward and
away rrom the nght. In order to detract from
the credit of the fame of the commodore In
that battle; that they wished also to detract
from the credit of all the officers of the Brook
lyn on account of the glorious part she took Id
that day's fight. It was the words to that ex
tent that I characterized as lying. There was
no lying In that colloquy unless a man stuck
to the verbal correctness of the words So I
did not characterize the paper as a Hal for
printing that colloquy."
After Lieutenant Dyion was excused Lieuten
ant Commander Hodgson was recalled for the
purpose of correcting errors In hU testimony as
printed in the official record. He took occasion
to change some of the language of his previous
testimony. One of these changes was made In
response to the questions asked yesterday as to
why he had designated aa a "liar and a black
guard" the editor of a newspaper which had
originally printed the alleged colloquy between
himself and Commodore Schley. He said' he de
sired to alter the reply that he had yesterday
given' to this interrogatory. He then said:
Hodgson on the Stand.
"Mr. Raynor asked if It was not necessary to
stop the ship to couple the uncoupled engines,
and the witness replied that the ship could have
been kept going with one engine while the other
was coupled. The engines were- designed, he
said, to be kept coupled during- war. Discuss
ing the speed of the various vessels of the fleet
on July 3, the witness said that the Oregon got
up a Ppeed about equal to the Brooklyn on that
day, notwithstanding that on her trial 1 trip the
Drooklyn made over twenty-one knots to the
Oregon's seventeen knots. , He called attention
to tr-.e ract that the New York had made six
teen or peventeen knots' ppeed on the day of
the battle. In response to questions from Cap
tain Parker he Bald that the New Tork had not
had her engines coupled on the day of battle
and that the Brooklyn had mane all the neces
sary speed. > . -. ' â¢, -'..
In response to other questions the witness de
tailed from the log of the Brooklyn all that was
done en that vessel to get up soeed. .
The reply was: "The Brooklyn has four main 1
engines, two to each shaft, connected together
by couplings. Sho has seven boilers, five main
and two auxiliary. On the morning of July 3
both forward engines were uncoupled; there
were banked fires under three of the main boll
era. Two other boilers were what we call
'dead,' no steam In them." Judging from the
time it took to start fires in these boilers after
the Spanish fleet came out of the harbor I
should say the furnaces were, not even primed
and two of the boilers had to be run up to
the fsea steaming level. It took from 9:35 to
10 o'clock to start fires."
"What does the Brooklyn's steam log show
as to the number of engines coupled up and
the boilers In use July 3, 189S, as compared
with the total engine and boiler power of the
vessel?"
At the* request of Captain Parker of counsel
for Admiral Schley the witness examined the
log of the New Orleans of May 30 and 31, 1898,
for the purpose of determining- accurately the
state of the weather, but he declined to modify
his statement of yesterday that the weather on
those days was bad. â¢ â¢
Captain Folger was then excused and Lieu
tenant Dyson was called. He was questioned
by Captain Lemly concerning the steaming

In this morning at the Instance of Admiral
SciUey's counsel for the purpose of giving
further teetimony concerning the availability

It was the understanding when court opened
that Commander Kichard Walnwrisrht would
be the principal witness of the day and that
alter he should be excused Messrs. Bristol,
Grant and .Potts would be called in the order
named. The three last mentioned were all
watch officers on various vessels of the Amer
ican fljet on July 3, when the naval engage
ment ctf Santiago was fought. It has been
the desire of the court to secure as much tes
timony as possible from the men whose especial
duty it was to keep a lookout and these three
officers were summoned to gratify this wish.
There was a special interest in Commander
Walnwright' s. testimony because of his prom
inent identification with the Spanish war and
also because of the fact. that he is now super
intendent, (ft the Naval Acadamy at Annapolis.

"The fact that they have occasional
earthquakes on the isthmus will not have
any effect upon the work now In progress
toward the ultimate building of the
canal. It would be idle to abandon the
project or unnecessarily delay commence
ment of the work because we are afraid
of earthquakes. On the. same principle
you might say It is idle to encourage tne
.growth of Southern cities because
Charleston \u25a0was once visited by a serious
earthquake.
"I have no doubt that this occurrence
may be ured by the opponents of the
canal as a reason why there should be
no definite action taken by Congress on
the subject this winter. The Panama
canal people are hard at work to defeat
the selection of the Nicaragua route, and
their efforts are reinforced by the Pan-
US* Railroad Company, the Pa-ciric
Steamship Company, the transcontinental
railroad systems, and in fact all those
\u25a0who are opposed to the -building of j a
canal by either the Nicaragua or Panama

Lieutenant Bristol had not concluded his
testimony when the court adjourned for
the day. He<iid not see the loop made by
the Brooklyn, the greater part of his tes
timony turning upon a chart he had made
showing, largely according to his memory,
the positions of the various ships of the
American fleet at different times during
the engagement of July 3. There were
several spirited controversies between
counsel over Questions asked the witness
by Mr. Itaynor concerning his chart.
Commander Wainwrlgnt's testimony
dealt largely with chart-making. He was
for a time senior member of the Board
of Navigators which prepared the official
chart snowing the position of the Ameri
can ships during the battle off Santiago,
and he gave details of the method of its
preparation. He said he did not consider
the positions assigned in that drawing ac
curate, but they were given as the result
cf a compromise of the views of the mem
bers of tne board.

000 to Pretoria. After I>r. Krause had
been paroled he went to Europe and ap
plied to Dr. Leyds, the agent of the
Transvaal, for money on account of these
services.
The prosecution Introduced evidence to
show that Dr. Krause was in communi
cation with Dr. Cornelius Borecksman, the
Public Prosecutor of Johannesburg, who
was executed September 30 last for trea
son, and that he urged the necessity for
shooting or otherwise disposing of Doug
lass Foster, an English lawyer attached
to Lord Roberts' staff, who was very ac
tive against the Boers.
The nrosecutlon Introduced letters in
which Dr. KraTise described Lord Milner
as "an arch scoundrel and an enemy of
Boer national existence and a willing tool
of the jingoes," and advised the burghers
to break their oaths and shoot traitors.
The letters indicated that Dr. Krause act

KINGSTON, Jamaica, Oct. 8.â The
newspapers here print a number of let-,
ters from Bocas del Toro and other ports
of Colombia complaining: of outrages on
British subjects, including women. Strong
appeals are made to the government to
send -tf warship for their protection and
also to demand compensation. Over a
hundred refugees have arrived here from
Colon.
COLON. Colombia, Oct. 8.â (Previous
cabling of this matter prevented.)â A
force of Liberals numbering at least 250
attacked Morro Island, commanding the
entrance to the port of Tumaco. Septem
ber 24th. The Island had all along been
garrisoned with fewer than a hundred
troops, well supplied with arms, ammuni
tion and commissary stores, including:
more than 150 head of cattle and other
provisions In proportion. The landing was
effected before daybreak by means of
canoes. \u25a0* Simultaneously the island was
stormed from the other end by Liberals
on the mainland. .
Morro Island Is surrounded by shallow
sandbanks and the only means of ap
proaching Tumaco is by the narrow river
which is within easy range of the Island.
The British steamer Quito, bound from
Guayaquil, Ecuador, for Panama and
touching at port3 between, anchored off
Morro Island on the night of September
28, and, weighing anchor at daybreak,
started up the stream toward Tumaco.
The Liberals fired a shot across her bows.
Suspecting the situation she immediate
ly turned, but rifle shots and one cannon
continued to be fired at her, the former
striking her several times and the latter
ohce, the ball making a hole right through
her above the water mark, though the
damage in other respects was slight.
The Quito then steamed to the farthest
pofnt the tide would permit and again an
chored. The firing was now resumed, but
it ceased after a few minutes, the Lib
erals having discovered the imprudence
of their action.
It is significant that shortly after the
Quito incident became known the British
warship Icarus left Panama for a desti
nation not made public, but presumably
Tumaco. The steamship agents have been
officially notified not to accept freight at
the iÂ»ort.

Bold Robberies in Victor.
SAN BERNARDINO, Oct. 8.-Vlctor,
the mining town thirty miles from this

Hotel, and while the clerk was out of the
office stole a revolver and a small sum of
money. They left the Jiotel and walked
to Preciado's saloon, where Jthey covered
the barkeeper and the loungers with their
revolvers. While one stood guard the
other rifled the money drawer, obtaining
about $100. They backed out of- the sa
loon and disappeared in the darkness.

woman by the assertion that such visi

had been brought about through such
wickedness as hers. Suffice it to say the

else and in the presence of an admiring

VICTORIA, â¢ B. C, Oct. 8,-News was
received from Fuchow, by the latest
Oriental liner, of the public suicide by
hanging 1 of a Chinese widow before a
crowd of *\u25a0 several hundred spectators.
The poor woman resolved upon killine
herself after* the death of her husband
and gave notice of her Intention, 'the
event being looked forward to by the
Chinese. Twice arrangements were marie
to carry out the suicide, but on account
of the ravages of a typhoon and because
of floods it was. twice postponed: v The
unfortunate woman sold the paddy field
she possessed for $160 and purchased
some splendid clothing and a coffin with
the money.
The taotai, getting word of her Inten
tion, had her brought before him and
kindly expostulated with â¢ her, pointing 1
out the unreasonableness and wrong ot
the resolve she had made, but all to no
effect. She said that her husband and
all her children were dead and she no
longer desired to live. The taotal's offer
to make provision for her did not divert
her from her purpose and he next sent
her brother-in-law with an order to pre
vent her carrying -out her intention, but
this action was equally useless. \u25a0

to express the very great gratification and
thankfulness I feel at being able to bo pres-.
ent at this convention, at least during a part
of its sessions, and my very earnest hope that
all* that Is done here may be for the well
being and the extension of your church and
of the church at large. I am not altogether
a stranger to San Francisco or to your con
ventions. I have been present at a number of
conventions â one at Philadelphia, eighteen
years ago. I shall not easily forget the dis
cussion when the first report of the commit
tee upon, the revision of the prayer book was
brought before the House of Deputies, nor cer
tainly shall I forget what I considered the
very marvelous chairmanship of the lay
man who was in the chair as the chairman
of the committee during that time. I had the
pleasure again nine years ago of being pres
ent at Baltimore when the revision of the
prayer book received its consummation, and
among the volumes in my library which I
value most highly is a presentation copy of
that prayer book, which was sent to me after
that convention.
With' a concluding expression of gratifi
cation at the visit of the deputation the
presiding Bishop brought the meeting to
a closed
"When the house reassembled a resolu
tion was offered inviting the deputation,
from the synod of Canada to seats on the
platform during its stay.
A vote was then taken upon the now
famous and much-debated Huntington
amendment, and it was lost by the fol
lowins vote:

on the campus to-day. McMillan" played

OGDEN, Utah, Oct. 8.â Professor
William Robinson, one of the
foremost musicians of Utah, was
found dead in his bed this morn-
ing. Â»He had been suffering from
neuralgia of the heart for some days and
had been taking medicine, but seemed in
his usual health last night when he re
tired. He was seen in his room "at 8 a. m.
to-day, but later was found reclining on
his bed dead. Cigarette smoking was the
remote cause of the disease.
Robinson came here from San Francisco
six months ago with an opera company,
which disbanded here. Since then he had
given Instruction on the piano and the
organ and had been employed as instruc
tor in the public' schools and as an or
ganist at several churches. He won a
place in the front rank In musical circles
in Utah during his short residence. He
was 38 years of age and had no relatives
in this country.
DISTINGUISHED DEPUTATION,
He was a pupil of the late Arthur Sulli
van at the Royal Academy of London,
from which he graduated. For eight
years he was musical director for D'Oyly
Carte, the original producer of all the
Gilbert and Sullivan operas.

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE DISCUSSED
After several seasons of touring through
the country Robinson located at Chicago,
where for some seasons he wielded the
baton at the Schiller Theater. Two years
ago he was called to the leadership of
the Southwell Opera Company, then play
ing an engagement at the Grand Opera
house in this city, and succeeded Selli
Simonson as leader. When \u25a0 his engage
ment expired he went on the road with a
comic opera company, and last February
succeeded Professor Hirshfeld as leader
of the Tivoli orchestra. On the termina
tion of his engagement at this house he
went on the road, and was out when
death claimed him.
The news of the death of Professor
Robinson came as a shock to his many
acquaintances in this city yesterday. Him
sterling qualities as a man and artist
were generally recognized and he became
very popular among all his associates.
He was a bohemian in the true sense of
the term, and there are many recipient:?
of his generosity who will sincerely
mourn his unexpected demise.
Professor Robinson was a native of
England. He received a good education
and at an early age evinced a talent for
music. He became a pianist of rare pow
er and soon attracted the notice of Lon
don managers. About, fifteen years ago
he. attached himself Savoy -Thea
ter, then devoted to-ttie exploitation of
the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He be
came a leader of the orchestra at that
house and when, ton years ago, the
D'Oyly Carte Company came to America
with the Gilbert .and Sullivan repertoire
he accompanied the company as leader
and concert master.

PUEBLO, Colo., Oct. 8.â The Daily
Chieftain to-morrow will say: The posi
tion of the beet-sugar manufacturers in
regard to the attack upon their industry
by the cane-sugar trust is given in a
statement made by W. I. Hartman, attor
ney for the National Beet Sugar Com
pany, whose refinery and lands are at
Sugar City, Colo.
This company's works and those of the
American Beet Sugar Company at Rocky
Ford began the annual sugar campaign
last week, and they are consuming about.
1500 tons of beets a day. Hartman says
the sugar mills will be run right along
the same as if the American Sugar Refin
ing Company's edict had not been made,
but the companies will not sell their prod
uct at at 3Vs cents a pound, as the trust Is
attempting to force them to do. Instead
they will store it if necessary, confident
that they will not have to hold It long,
but that if necessary they are able to hold
it until they get a living price. A com
bination of all the beet-sugar works is In
timated by Hartman.

Cuts the Price of Prunes.
SAN JOSE, Oct. .8.â The California
Cured Fruit Association has cut the price
on old crop prunes to '3 cents basis.
\u25a0 When the conflagration was subdued it
was found that twelve stores and â¢ four
large dwellings had tbeen burned to the
ground. Besides a nnmber of fish-riTv'ne
sheds 'were razed. It is estimated that
the loss is about $40,000. Magistrate
Brooking's loss amounts to "nearly $10,WU,
in drug stock and premises.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 8.â The fish
ing town of Steveston, at the mouth of
the Fraser River, where' hundreds of
thousands of oases of salmon are annual
ly packed for shipment to Europe, was
nearly destroyed by fire this morning.
The conflagration was the direct result of
incendiarism, the motive being found in
enmity recently stirred up by legal deci
sions rendered by the local justice of the
peace, W. H. Brooking, who is also owner
of one of the stores destroyed. Residents
of Steveston who are In touch with the
question excitedly aver that -to the bad
feeling engendered between former Chief
of Police Johnson and Magistrate Brook
ing the disaster is attributable. It was
mainly owing to Brooking's effort that
Johnson was discharged.
The fire was observed. at 3 o'clock in the
morning to be enwrapping Brooking's
store. Before the volunteer brigade could
be summoned ;he flames had spread over
a large section of ground. Hand pumps
were brought out and bucket brigades
formed and the- flames fought in this
primitive manner till the brigades of Van
couver and New Westminster reached the
scene, after a hard drive of nearly twenty
miles.

STEVESTON'S HEAVY LOSS *
BY I1TCENDIAIIY BLAZE
MACKAY'S HENO
DEFEATS YANKEE
For a while Buchie was safe, but some
enterprising citizen said that it was a
shame to let such a contemptible being
exist in the town. Then a crowd marched
upon the jail, threw open the N doors and
dragged out , the anarchist.
The fire hose was attached to a hyd
rant and turned upon the cringing
wretch. After he had been thoroughly
cleansed he was told to get out of town
and never appear there again. His exit
was undignified.
SEATTLE, Oct. 8.â The people of Te
koa, Wash., have invented an entirely
new method of dealing with anarchi&ts.
Briefly stated they expunge from their
creed the vulgar system of hanging and
substitute the more cleansing and yet
more depressing gush of the fire hose.
According to the latest reports the in
novation has proved 'efficacious and will
be used exclusively for all persons who
express ideas of an anarchistic tendency.
The especial object of Tekoa' s indig
nation is John Buchie, who has been
driven from pillar to post ever since he
spoke too freely after tire assassination
of President McKinley. Spokane kicked
him out and then Fairfield gave him
a similar push. When he landed in Te
koa the City Marshal, was compelled to
put him in jail to prevent a mob using
him fdr a football, the season's practice
having just commenced.
The rain began last night, but the storm,
which formed off Galveston did not break
until early this morning, and from 3 a. m.
until 3 p. m. the precipitation was tremen
dous. For the fourteen hours ending at
12:30 p. m. 14.08 inches of water fell. From
8 a. m. to 1 p. in: three inches fell.
The rain- was accompanied by wind,
which blew forty-two miles an hour at
11:30 a.*m. from the east. The streets were
inundated and streetcar traffic was
stopped, all business being practically
suspended.
The damage cannot be estimated at this
time, but it is not believed to be heavy.
Some of the buildings were partly flooded
by water backing over the streets. The
tide was only two feet above normal, and
there was no salt water in the streets.
The rain was local, extending only along
a portion of the Texas coast and inland
for firty or sixty miles with less,intensity.
GALVESTON, Tex., Oct. 8.â Galveston
was visited by the heaviest rainfall in Its
history to-day.

The Sketch draws attention to the fact
that there has been no notice In any Eng
lish journal of the remarkable life of the
Prince Imperial which was recently pub
lished In France. "The author," says the
Sketch, "had the audacity to combine a
kind of drama with biography." The
book Is a dialogue, -with a running com
mentary. It reproduces, for Instance, a
conversation which is supposed to be ex
changed between father and son on the
battlefield of Saarbrucken at the begin
ning of the Franco-Prussian War.
It dramatizes a scene in a miserable Inn
in the Ardennes, where the fugitive Prince
enters for a moment with Duperre, who
is conducting him out of France. The
writer rises to the supreme height .of sen
sationalism when he represents Imagin
ary conversations between the unfortu
nate Prince and the equally unfortunate
Charlotte Watkins on her daily journeys
between Woolwich and London. It is not
a pleasant book to read, especially when
Its author deals with the tragedy in Zu
luland.
Miss Marie Corelll is one of those who
suffer mest from the penalty of great
ness. Like other leading lights in litera
ture and in politics, she has her enemies
who refuse to leave her alone in the se
clusion for which she yearns. One of the
bitterest attacks ever made upon her haa
been that for which she is most unjustly
accused â namely, the publication of her
geography In a series of biographies of
eminent people which she has been ac
cused by certain irresponsible writers of
having published as an advertisement of
herself. Now, nothing could have been
more unjust, for if ever any person de
sired to live a- retired life, with only Inti
mate friends around her, it is Miss Co
relli.
She could not even have a photograph
taken lest it might be seized upon by
some one for publication in some Illus
trated masrazine or paper.
Writing to the Dally Chronicle, Miss
Corelli in defense says she is at present
the recipient of daily Insult from various
quarters on account of that small btjou
biography which was published In a com
panion volume to those on the King, Lord
Roberts, Lord Kitchener and others.
"Have any of these." she pertinently
asks, "been accused of writing their own
biographies for purpose of advertise
ment?" But that libel is being freely cir
culated about herself. As a matter of
fact, she made every effort to prevent,
that biography being published. She adds
that the publisher himself can confirm
the statement. On" asking a solicitor's ad
vice on the subject she was told that un
less the biography contained something
false and libelous she could not success
fully take exception to It in any court of
law.
I It has been generally supposed that
"The Aristocrats" owed its conception to
the sudden craze for epistolary fiction.
As a matter of fact. I hear that Mrs.
Atherton'3 book was In the hands of tha
publishers last September. The story was,
I believe, issued anonymously, becauso
all of Mrs. Atherton's work has been re
ceived with a certain amount of abuse In
America, and she wished the work to
stand the test of unbiased criticism.
It may be guessed, then, with what rel
ish she found the newspapers which had
been most consistent in denouncing her
were loudest In their praise of "The Aris
tocrats."
Everybody has heard of that remarka
ble woman, the" Empress Dowager of
China, but not, perhaps, her name. It is
Yehonala. Georffe Lynch, who -was with
the allies in China, mentions it in his
forthcoming book- He thinks Yehonala
the most marvelous woman in the world,
and the Chinese not the least remarkable
nation. Mr. Lynch makes no pretense to
erudite knowledge. He thinks the Chi
nese were to blame, but he seeks to sec
out their case fairly. He offers an ac
count, "disjointed, lopsided, incomplete,"
of much that appeared to him as a "for
eign devil" during the recent conflict of
China with Western civilization. It ia
really a notebook, as its title implies.

of light on the childhood of Queen Vic

placed In her possession for purposes of

with the Queen's girlhood. Mrs. Gurney

that it was derived from the drehtanz, or
turning dance. The latter was introduced
in France by Louis XIV \ after the con

VOTERâ I. W. G... City. In order to
vote in the State of California the citizen
must have been a resident of the State

claims his vote ninety days and in the
precinct thirty days next preceding elec
tion, provided he has complied with the
law regarding registration. .
After citing numerous instances of official corrup
tion in Philadelphia and in the, State, and several
illustrations of the toleration of the: abuses by the
better class of citizens, the writer goes on to explain
that the evils are due mainly to the fact that the peo
ple are so much absorbed in business affairs, or in
the maintenance of the Pennsylvanian idea of a dig
nified social position, that they not only neglect poli
tics, but occasionally even scorn men for performing
their political duties. He says: "Pennsylvania is a
State' of large corporations; office in them is more
attractive than political office. The president of the
Pennsylvania Railway gets $50,000 a year; the Gov
ernor of the State gets $10,000. The presidency of
the railway lasts for life, the governorship for a
thorny uncertain four years. There are in the Penn
sylvania Railway system more than -200 officials that
have more pay and more power than the Governor
of the State;' and there are- in the State a score of
corporations only a little less imposing than the Penn
sylvania Railway. Is it any wonder that the best of
the young men take to the corporations and devote
their every energy to promotion therein, leaving 1
politics to the less capable, the less intelligent- and
the less mor.al?"
In addition to such inducements to unite with' the
corporations the abler young * men of Pennsylvania
are further carried away from a performance of their
duties as citizens by a social sentiment among men
of wealth and of good birth that is distinctly, averse
to a political career. It is said: "Had Senator Lodge
ONE of the severest arraignments ever made
against an American commonwealth is that
published in the Atlantic for October under
the title, "The Ills of Pennsylvania." The writer,
who signs himself "A Pennsylvanian," begins by
pointing out that when Philadelphia recently tried to
borrow $9,000,000 at 3 per cent she obtained only
$5000, and adds: "When political knavery reaches
the point where the State's- financial credit is im
paired, then even calloused Pennsylvania realizes that
it is no longer a mere cry ' of wolf, and begins a
searching of hearts."
The writer asserts that politically Pennsylvania is
the most corrupt State in the Union, and he quotes
with approval the saying of a Philadelphia editor:
"I have lived in Nevada in the boom times, I have
lived in New York through several administrations,
I ' have lived in the easy virtue of official Washing
ton; Pennsylvania beats them all. Pennsylvania has
every kind of political deviltry I ever saw or heard of
elsewhere, and a few kinds that she has evolved her
self." â¢ : \ \u25a0 .-'

Uncle Sam is financially able to undertake those
much desired river and harbor improvements in Cali

UNDER ordinary circumstances it would be- a
useless waste of time and energy to assemble
a State convention 1* any part of California
to consider the Chinese exclusion act. Upon that
question the campaign of education has been com
plete, and the opinion of the people upon^ it is well
nigh unanimous. It happens, however, that the cir
cumstances surrounding the issue at this time are by
no means ordinary. The advocates of immigration
have managed to appeal successfully to powerful in
terests in the Eastern States, and accordingly the op
position to any comprehensive and adequate system
of restriction has already become bold and outspoken
in that section of the Union.
Such being the Gase it is well to have a convention
for the double purpose of rousing our own people to
a renewal of the fight against the yellow peril and of
impressing upon the Eastern mind the fact that upon
this question the people of the Pacific Coast are
united and will accept no compromise.
As has been pointed out in the call for the conven
tion issued by the Mayor and the Supervisors, the
exclusion act, after having been in existence for
about ten years* will expire next May, and accord
ingly the question of its re-enactment will have to be
decided at the coming session of Congress. The Chi
nese have learned of the richness of the United States
and are eager to obtain an opportunity to pour their
millions cf workers into the country. The- Chinese
Minister at Washington has made appeals both to
the North and to the South for support. He has
'sought to win over the Southern people by promising
them abundant cheap labor for their manufacturing
enterprises, while in the North the merchants and the
.manufacturers have been informed there would be a
much bigger and more profitable trade for them in
China if only the exclusion act were repealed and the
Chinese immigrants were treated like friends. â¢
It is safe to say that a man so adroit as Minister
Wu has not confined his work against' the exclusion
act to the speeches and the writings he has addressed
to the. public. He has doubtless had heart to heart
talks with persons of influence whose interests are
likely to be advanced by permitting: the act to pass
from the statute books. He and they will have in
genious ways of postponing the issue and preventing
action upon it. It is not improbable, therefore, that
the fight for the re-enactment of the law may be a
much harder one than has been expected. At any
rate, it will do no harm for California to speak out
on the subject. To us an unrestricted Chinese im
migration would bring ruin. Our fight on this issue
is not one of politics merely, but. for life itself.'

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
previous session and more
young men than at any Grand Lodge that
has ever convened in the temple.
THE Grand Lodge of Free and
Accepted Masons of California
met in annual session in the
Masonic Temple yesterday. A
larger number of representa
tives were present than at any
Proceeding to explain what these issues are -and
how they should be presented to attract the thought
ful and independent, Mr. Quincy says: "The Demo
cratic party should be uncompromising in opposi
tion to certain Republican policies, and in its advo
cacy of progressive legislation in the interests of the
mass of the people. In the nature of the case it must
tend to favor the side of labor rather than that of
capital where their interests are antagonistic, just as
the Republican party is necessarily capitalistic in its
tendencies; but the Democratic party need not put
forward such a radical programme that the Ameri
can people, who are at bottom pretty conservative,
cannot be persuaded to accept it; and it need not
rest its case before the people upon any principles
lacking scientific foundation. * * * In my view
statesmanship must be to a large extent .based upon
opportunism rather than upon abstract principle, in
order to accomplish any results." - \u25a0
Whatever view may be taken of the obscurity or
lack of it on the part of Mr. Quincy- himself, no one
can- accuse him of .obscurity in his platform. It is a
plain' and clear declaration of support to any policy
that promises ito catch votes, j Mr. Quincy is in favor
of a platform that'will array labor against capital, but
sufficiently mild to obtain support from the thought
ful and independent. Whatsoever opportunity of
fers, he will take advantage of. Such is the leader
whom Massachusetts offers to Democracy as a
Moses. It remains to be seen whether Jones of
Arkansas will approve the choice.
To his fellow Democrats of ; Boston, at any rate,
Mr. Quincy is a man who merits a boom, and they
have arranged to give him one. They propose to
nominate him for Governor this year, and, foreseeing
his defeat, they offer to add to the nomination the
promise of a renoraination at the next election. It is
like inducing a man to buy one gold brick by prom
ising that if he will return to the same place about
the same time next year he will be given another.
Meeting his friends in the spirit in which they ap
proached him, Mr. Quincy has written a letter in
which he announces his views concerning the wide
sea of politics and the situation of the Democratic
crew. He says: "The first efforts of the" Demo
cratic party should be to harmonize and consolidate
itself; to that end it should bring forward such issues
in harmony with the fundamental and unchanging
principles of Democracy as will attract to it the
thoughtful and independent citizen."
Among these men is Josiah Quincy of Boston.
Of course Mr. Quincy can 'hardly be classed as v an
obscure man, for no resident of Boston can be that,
nor could any Quincy. A Quincy of Boston must al
ways be more or. less conspicuous and he will always
rank as a great man in Massachusetts. Nevertheless,
this particular Mr.- Quincy is just about the kind of
man that Jones of Arkansas referred to as obscure,
the difference in the appearance of Mr. Quincy being
due solely to the difference between the Arkansas and
the Massachusetts point of view.
SOME time ago Chairman Jones of the Demo
cratic'National Committee predicted that Mr.
Bryan would be dropped from the list of candi
dates before the next Democratic Presidential con
vention, and that the nominee would be some person
now living in obscurity and unknown to the great
masses of the people. The suggestion has of course
given hopes to a good many men who have no na
tional fame but enough of local reputation to give
them at least a chance to be heard of by those who
are looking in obscure places for the new Moses.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The session was called to order by the
grand master and opened In due form.
After the report of the committee on cre
dentials the grand master presented his
annual report, which shows the fraternity
to be In a most satisfactory condition.
There Is a membership of about 23,000 dis
tributed in 271 lodges, showing an increase
during the year of more than 1200 mem
bers.
During the year a new lodge -was Insti
tuted at Oxnard, In Ventura County, one
was instituted at Manila, P. I., and the
Hawaiian and Philippine Islands were
added to the California jurisdiction.
The public ceremonies during the year
were laying the corner-stones of the
courthouse at Madera, High School at
Oakdale, High School at Berkeley, post
offlce at Stockton, High School at Ana
heim and Masonic halls at Bakersfield,
Oxnard and Hanford.
At the afternoon session there \u25a0were
presented the rtpqrts of the grand secre
tary, grand treasurer, grand lecturer and
the several committees, which were re
ferred to the committee on distribution.
The Grand Lodge decided to go in a body
to the Masonic Home at Decoto to-day*;
therefore there will not be any -session.
The lodge will meet again at 9:30 o'clock
to-morrow morning.
The visitors to the home will leave this
city at 11 o'clock this morning by special
train.
During the present session \u25a0William S.
Wells, deputy grand master, will be ad
vanced to the office of grand master;
George Johnson -will be continued as grand
secretary and Edward Coleman as grand
treasurer. The .only contest will be for
grand senior warden. There are several
candidates for this office, which Is the one
that leads to that of grand master. Judge
Carroll Cook appears to be In the lead.
The twenty-third annual meeting 1 of the
Masonic Veterans will be held to-day.
John "W. Linscott, senior, and Thomas J.
Baker, Junior grand steward; "William
Kettner, granl pursuivant; Samuel D.
Mayer, grand organist, and G. P. Adams,
grand tyler.
Goldwin Smith says the best way to eliminate
anarchy from the land is to give, more time in the
public schools to the teaching of music. It appears
to be the theory of the' professor that, a man who
sings or plays upon some instrument never commits
murder, but he ignores the frequency with which
singers' and musicians tempt other folks to shoot or
throw a brick. ...
There is a morbid conception of religion that re
lates it solely to death, to the last incident of mor
tality, and turns its hope to a dirge, its song to a
threnody, and its purpose into the disposition of
things unseen, forgetting this world and its sunshine
and the banners which the seasons unfurl upon its
mountains and plains.
Those who hold this morbid conception may take
great comfort in the wholesome ways of this conven
tion, and may learn that whatever world the eye of
faith may see beyond, this great body is inspired by
the conviction that nothing in this present world is
too good for man's reasonable enjoyment in prepara
tion for the world to come.
The debates have been intellectual combats in
which training, genius and courtesy have most highly
illustrated rhetoric as an art of persuasion, and the
discussions have disclosed an abiding interest fn the
church, hand in hand with a genuine patriotism which
inspires confidence in that feature of our system
which keeps church and state apart for the good of
each.
In another respect the great convention gratifies
and charms our people by its gentleness of spirit
toward all other religious bodies. This spirit \yas ut
tered in Dr. Huntington's "vision of the future
Church of the Reconciliation.
So, in its lesson of charity, activity, union/bf the
humble and the high, in the universality of its sym
pathies, this body has entered the heart of our peo
ple and has raised San Francisco perceptibly higher
than before above that which is merely gros* and
sordid.
The prayer uttered by the English dean in his
memorial poem on the death of President McKinley
.embraced in the scheme of faith all who are, and San
Francisco cries, out with him:
Oh, guide thy peoples by the way of peace
Through cleansing splendors to the gates of light.
SAN FRANCISCO has proved worthy of the
kindest conception of her quality, and perhaps
better than her fame, by" the interest of all her
people in the great General Convention of the Epis
copal church that is sitting in'solemn session here. \
We have frequent political conventions that meet
to consider temporal things, and as our temporalities
touch us daily and we often mistake them for the real
quick it is only natural thafsuch conventions are at
tractive and that our interest in them asserts itself in
many ways. But here is a great body of solemn and
earnest men, gathered from many zones, met to con
sider things eternal and not made with hands, and in
stantly among all our people runs the voice of the
Spirit, crying that these things ineffable are the real
quick, the highest concern of man.
In this convention are gathered those who come
from places, wide apart. The preacher of the Word"
whose shelter is an Indian tepee, and who spreads
the sacramental elements in a forest temple, sits be
side him who breaks the bread of life in the cathe
dral, in light dyed to softness, in air sweetened by
music. It is a spiritual democracy in convention as
sembled, to which all kindreds and tongues of men
are welcome, coming in the name and countersign of
a common form and faith.
The people are faithful readers of the daily proceed
ings of this convention, and among' many there is
surprise at the revelation. The Episcopal church in
this country works as quietly as the forces of nature.
It affects but little grandeur in its churches. Even
in large cities these are quite plain wooden struc
tures, imposing but iittle burden upon their builders
and leaving the parish free from mortgage and inter
est. The church charities are administered, its place
in society held and its mission executed with such
absence of ostentation that -when its general conven
tion reports aggregate the work done men are aston
ished at the grand total.
It is still a missionary church, as when Heber wrote
"From Gieenland's Icy Mountains," and. from many
lands come affiliated delegates, to bring tidings of
the gospel progress on far continents and islands.
The writer finds the primal cause'for: the difference
between Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in the dif
ference between the spirit of the early Quakers and.
the spirit -of the Puritans. "The Puritans were a
church militant. The Puritan went to church with
a Bible in one hand and in the other a musket for
hostile Indians. The Quaker- settled his difficulties
with the Indians by reading tracts to them. * * *
The Puritan insisted en governing his common
wealth in his own way. The Puritan formed the dom
inating habit, and to this day Puritan ideas dominate
the essentially non-Puritan population of Massachu
setts. Among the Quakers, on the other hand, meek
ness was a cardinal virtue. The early Quakers, in
slead of strangling doctrines" not in agreement with
their own, instead of casting, out the apostles of
strange creeds, welcomed them and tolerated them.
Put in a minority by the unrestricted immigration of
less worthy people, and lacking the strenuous, domi
nating spirit of the Puritans, the early Quakers soon
let the control of the colony pass into the hands of
the least desirable elements, and there it has always
remained." .
.Such is the theory which a- native of the State puts
forth to account for the surrender of Pennsylvania
to a control which has made her politics a byword
for corruption. The moral seems to be that expressed
by President Roosevelt in the ' words': "In the long
run a class of professional non-combatants is as
hurtful to the best interests of a community as a class
of professional wrongdoers." The statement merits
the earnest consideration of those people in San
Francisco who deem themselves "good citizens" but
who neglect their civic duties.
and the b.te Governor Wolcott beeruborn in Phila
delphia they might have/attained fame as golf cham
pions', or cotillon leaders,*but never as writers, col
lege professors or politicians except at the sacrifice of
social position."

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
A dastardly attempt to blow up one of
the hoisting engines on Mission-street
wharf was made yesterday morning. The
collier Asuncion Is lying at the wharf and
Bennett & Goodall are discharging her.
One of the engineers is a non-union man
and when he ieft the hoisting machine
Monday night the boiler was full of water
and the fire laid ready for an early start
yesterday morning. During the night
some one ran the water out of the boiler
and fixed the gauge so as to make it show
a full supply. Yesterday morning the en
gineer made his lire and when the boiler
was well heated the water disappeared
from the gauge. He was about to turn
more water into the boiler when he decid
ed to investigate. Turning a stopcock, he
found the boilsr empty and at once drew
the fires. Had he turned in the water the
machine wouM have been wrecked and
the engineer probably killed.

The Meade is now seven days out on her
way here from Manila, while the Dix has
nearly finished loading on the Sound and

The Sheridan has not yet sailed from
Manila and the Logan is being rapidly
put into shape at Mare Island.
The Kilpatrick. with the Eighteenth
infantry aboard, is scheduled to arrive
next Friday. She comes direct from Iloilo
and is expected to make good time. The
Thomas is now -loafting for Manila and
will get away en the ltkh inst., while the
Grant, which was to have gone out on
that date, has been laid up for repairs. â¢
Captain Batchelder. formerly assistant
quartermaster of the transport service,
has been assigned to the transport Sher
man temporarily as quartermaster cap
tal.i.
The Samner. the Lawton, the Relief and
the cable ship Burnside have been de
rached from the San Francisco depart
ment and assigned to a new department
with headquarters at Manila, The
chances are that it will be majiy a long
day before the boys on these ships see
San Francisco again unless they resign or
the vessels come here for an overhauling.
Work on the Sherman Is progressing at
the Union Iron Works, but it will be the
first of the year before the transport will
be able to go into commission again. The
Sherman went to the Union about the
same time the Alameda went to the Ris

ney sailed for the isthmus via way

"il'j tons, all of which is New York mer-
Cbeadise for S?an Francisco houses, \u25a0while
ihc Sydney's consignments are light and
are for ports from Mazatlan to Panama.
The passengers on the Argyll were: Al
bert Franck. Fred Schleyer. Mrs. L.
Meizer, E. Moesch, Mrs. J. H. Beekman
and four children. Paul Gardner, Paul
Uallois and Louis Gallois.
They all say that business on the
isthmus is at a standstill. Every man
and boy able to bear arms has been draft
ed into the military service and the wives
and daughters are earning their own live
lihood. Along the line of railroad there
is no fighting nor is there the slightest
chance of a disturbance, as both sides are
afraid of the United States taking a hand
in the matter. In the interior, however.
the poor are suffering terribly and many
are dying from star\ation. When the
Argyll lett Panama with her passengers
the Government of Colombia seemed to
have the insurrection in .hand, "but." said
the passengers with a shrug of the should
ers and an uplifting of the hands, "there
is no telling- what a day may bring forth."

this purpose. The Government was restrained
from paying the money by constitutional lim
itation, and the American Board seemed equally
restrained from payins a ransom.
Sympathy of the President.
The solicitude of the committee was such
and their purpose to do everything was so
strong that they sent a deputation consisting
of the president and one of its secretaries to
Washington to meet President Roosevelt and
the officials of the State Department. This
conference was held last Saturday forenoon
It is Impossible to overstate the sympathy and
Interest of the President, the acting Secretary
of State and other officials.
The conference was lengthy, during whlcn
the Government showed what steps it was
taking and how every power of diplomacy
was being used to effect the release of Miss
Stone. Confidential details were given, which,
of course it would be a breach of trust to give
to the public but the friends of the board and
the whole nation may be assured that every
thing possible is being done , to further the
recovery of Miss" Stone. The heart and the
persistence olV the President in this effort were
most significant. The officials assured us that
apparently at the moment the only practicable
method to secure her life was to have the
funds promptly at hand to pay the ransom. It
was evidently the positive conviction of the
Government that this step was the first one
to be taken. But It ought to be clearly under
stood that this Is but one step; that when she
has been released there will be a vigorous at
tempt not only to secure the return of the
money but furthermore, to bring about such
conditions that such an occurrence shall not
be possible In the future. Xo one doubts that
our Government as at present organized will
not drop this matter until the rights of Ameri
can citizenship are established.-
Meanwhile a movement was begun under the
leadership of Miss Stone's family to secure by
popular appeal the amount of the ransom, and
notice had already been sent out that funds
could be sent to Boston. -
Under this advice of the Government a meet
ing of the prudential committee was called on
Sunday morning, which was attended by eight
members of the committee and four officers.
The report of the gentlemen sent to Washing
ton was received, and after full deliberation It
was decided that, while we could not recede
from the action of last Friday, the tidings of
the Government made It most evident that the
first thing was to secure Mies Stone's safety,
then, other steps would follow; therefore we
felt that as individuals it was our duty and
privilege to help by all means in our power
the securing of this ransom from the general
public. Communications were sent by" tele
gram, so far as possible, to every part of the
country, even to the Pacific -Coast.
Money in- sums large and small has been
received In answer to this appeal to humanity.
The Government has shown its supreme inter
est in this matter by already becoming the
custodian of this fund, as handed to It by the
firm of Kidder, Peabody & Co. This plan not
only shows the Government's interest, but it
forbids any possibility that any part of the
money will be paid over until Miss Stone per
sonally has-been placed In safety In the hands
of the proper authorities.
It will be seen from the above statement that
the board was a"~trolt in Its whole "action from
the beginning and consistent throughout. Its
officers and friends are willing to use every
effort to procure this fund under the "conditions
and limitations given. Any one who had been
present at the conference in Washington would
not hesitate to have full confidence in the Gov
ernment's efforts. The official^ of the board,
having been received Into its confidence, are
willing to trust the Government, and we have
no doubt that the friends of the board will
have confidence in us.
Raising Money. for Ransom.
BOSTON, Oct. 8.â No additional state
ment of money received for the ransom
fund for Miss Stone was given out to
night by Kidder, Peabody & Co. after the
one of the late afternoon showing $49,
574 81 in cash and $7000 in unpaid pledges.
This made the total $56,574 61, to- which
will be added in the- morning the sums
received over night. The rush of contrib
utors Is over, because of the general opin
ion that the critical moment has been

Utah Judge Passes Sentence on Young
Man Called the "Boy
Murderer." Y
LOGAN, Utah, Oct. 8.â In the' District
Court to-day Judge Hart sentenced Abe
Majors, popularly known as "the boy
murderer," to life imprisonment for the
killing of Captain Brown, chief of the
Ogden police, three years ago.
J Majors, who is barely out of his teens,
was convicted of the crime and sentenced
to be shot in 1899, but the Supreme Court
granted him a new .trial, which was con
cluded on Saturday.

averted, and that a month's time offers
ample opportunity to add to the fund.
Charles A. Stone, brother of the captive
missionary, wishes activity for the fund
to continue for a few days longer. He
hopes that the cable dispatches indicat
ing that the brigands have granted a
month's time are right, yet he has no per
sonal confirmation of that fact, although
he has repeatedly sent, messages to both
Constantinople and Samokov. He says
that, the idea In the "West that he had
stated that no money is needed because
enough has been given is all wrong. He
is still anxious about getting the total of
$110,000. â¢
Next Saturday will be the twenty-third
anniversary "of Miss Stone's sailing from
Boston for the missionary field in Bul
garia.
Accuses Turkey's Sultan.
KAXSAS CITY, Oct. 8.â Dr. M. Mesro
pian of this city, a physician and a na
tive of Armenia, who has lectured much
in Eastern cities on the atrocities prac
ticed .upon the Armenians by the Turks,
declares that the abduction of Miss Stone,
the American missionary, by brigands in
Bulgaria was the work of the Sultan of
Turkey. He said:
I am sure that it was he who ordered the
brigands to carry off Miss Stone. He ordered
her taken acro3s the Bulgarian border so as
to distract suspicion from himself. It is a
move In retaliation for the enforced payment
of the $90,000 Indemnity that the United States
exacted of him for the burning: of American
missionary buildings. I believe it would be far
better for the Government to send a warship
over there than to pay the ransom. Mission
aries will not be safe after Abdul , Hamld has
received, the ransom. Missionaries will be ab
ducted everywhere. The Sultan is determined
to be revenged for the loss of that $90,000 and
the abduction serves a double purposeâ the re
turn of the money and the behest of fanaticism.
There is rto crime the Turk would not commit

of "War George D. Meiklejohn, resuming
his detailed a conversation he
had with Hawkes, in which the latter de
clared that unless he was appointed to a
position he would publish the details of

him that so far as he was concerned he
might do so. It was during this talk that
Hawkes told him of his controversy with
Flint, Eddy & Co., Hawkes expressing the
opinion that his appointment had been re

F. S. Brown, a clerk in the office of the
auditor of the JVar Department, was
called to testify as to the auditing of a

$5000. The account was certified to by-
Adjutant General Corbin. The records
showed that the cost of the Heistand

Miss Stone. The United States will advance
the money, afterward settling with Turkey.
The Turkish authorities have made numerous
arrests among the Bulgarian population, with
out distinction of religion, and nearly all- have
been put to torture in the hope of abstracting
Information. A prisoner named Dimitrl said an
understanding existed between the Protestants
and the Macedonian committee, and that Miss
Stone was even acting in concert with them,
with the view of obtaining funds for a political
religious propaganda. These declarations,
wrung from Dimitrl under torture, are value
less. What is certain is that the captain of the
band designated for the payment of the ransom
a place In proximity to the Roumanian frontier,
which proves that he hopes to escape the Turk
ish police, and that the Bulgarian police do not
cause him anxiety.
This condition of affairs is shown by the fact
that five or six bands of brigands of twelve or
fifteen men each have become so bold between
Strumitza and Kuprill that- the officials of the
Oriental Railroad have requested the Turkish
military authorities to reinforce the troops
guarding the track and bridges.

HARTFORD, Conn., Oct. 8.â An inter

the American board of commissioners for
the board of foreign missions, which be
gan here this afternoon, was the response
by Dr. Capen, president of the board, to
the address of welcome delivered by Rev.
EX P. Parker. D.D., of this city.. Dr.
Capen said:
We are in great anxiety over the fate of
Miss Helen Stone.* so greatly beloved, who is
to-day in the hands of the bandits 'with the
sentence of death hanging over her. It is a
comfort In our tears to know that our Gov
ernment is doing everything that is possible
to be done for her rescue. Saturday Secretary
Smith of this board and myself met President
Hoosevelt and Assistant Secretary Adee In
conference on this matter. If Miss Stone were
a member of his own family Mr. Roosevelt
could hardly put more heart into it.
Every power of diplomacy Is being used for
her rescue. We must thank God that although
President McKinley is gone there is in Presi
dent Roosevelt another man of God who will
see that American missionaries under' the flag
of the stars and stripes shall have the fullest
possible protection. It may be necessary that
a ransom shall be 'paid, but that will not close
the incident. It will be but the beginning of
the chapter. *

After devotional exercises at this even-

President Capen read the official report
of the board concerning the captivity and
ransom of Miss Stone. The report fol
lows:
There Is such universal Interest In the case of
Miss Helen Stone, now In the hands of brig
ands, that It seems wise for the officers of the
board to make a brief statement of the facts as
they exist at the present time. For several
weeks the Government authorities at Washing
ton have been at work using every possible ef
fort to secure her release. These have been
days of deep anxiety for the officers of the
board. We have been in frequent communica
tion with our representative In Constantinople.
Last Thursday we received a dispatch from
Washington that told us how Increasingly
grave the situation had become. On the re
ceipt of this telegram a meeting of the pru
dential committee was hastily called to meet
the following day at 12 o'clock. The committee
came together and discussed the situation most
thoroughly. On the one side was the life of a*
dearly beloved missionary; on the other side
was the fact that if we yielded to this demand
for ransiJm It was putting a premium upon the
life of every missionary of the American Board,
and not of our board only, but missionaries of
every society in the world. The question was
even broader than the case of missionaries; it
practically : concerned the safety of any and
every American citizen. Recognizing the full
gravity of the situation, the committee, without
a dissenting vote, decided that it had no right
to pay a ransom and establish a precedent that
would be sure to be dangerous In all the future
Furthermore, we were restrained by the fact

when the people of the Canaan district

The hunt Is booked to start at Pipe

The mustangs, or desert horses, are so
thick in the district lying between Hur

that ranchers are complaining on many
scores. The range is being eaten up, gen

valuable animals are being shot by mis

posed desert horses. So the populace has
decided that the mustang must go.
. Two years ago a similar decision was
reached. During thÂ© progress of the hunt
300 horses were shot and left on the plain
and 1500 were run down and dispatched,
with the exception of 300 considered worth,

/f N. W. f WASHINGTON. Oct. 8.-
IL . Though the . time limit within
which the ransom for Miss Stone
was to have been paid expired at
noon to-day, the woman, according to in
formation received By the State Depart
ment. Is etill alive. This gratifying intel
ligence Ib clouded by a suspicion of the
course which Bulgaria has pursued.
Should the suspicion now entertained that
Bulgaria participated In the plot for the
.American missionary's abduction be ab
eolutely confirmed, it is the purpose of
this Government to BUbmit a heavy claim
which shall include indemnity for Miss
Stone and the amount of ransom that will
be paid, or. In "he event of her death, an
Indemnity for her heirs. The officials in
sist that there is xio fund out of which
the ransom of Miss Stone can be dis
bursed, but there Is reason to believe that
the secret fund of the Slate Department
will be used to supplement the amount
contributed by the charitable of the Unit
ed States In case the money collected
ehould not reach the sum fixed by Miss
Stone's captors. The department is ob
eerving the utmost reticence, claiming
that an ill-advised publication may de
feat the elaborate plans they have under
way for the woman's rescue. The officials
absolutely refuse to confirm or deny
rumors in circulation as to the negotia
tions in progress, but say that everything
possible is being done to rescue Miss
Stone.

Vienna representative:
In reply to a telegram I addressed to him to

donian committee, denies that the committee
had any hand In the abduction of Miss Stone.
He adds that the committee desires the support
of the civilized world for the Macedonian cause,
and therefore would not commit such a folly.
"The Turks," he says, "did the deed, and
Turkey must be made responsible."

that the Bulgarian Government is not do

Public interest in the fate of Miss Helen
M. Stone, the kidnaped American mis
sionary, intensifies here. There Is wide
spread condemnation of the Government
for allowing such freedom to the Macedo
nian committee as to enable it to engl
reer the outrage.
Miss Stone resided here before she went
to Saloniea and she is well known
throughout the country. The patriotic
Bulgarians are incensed, as they recog
nize that Miss Stone and her colleagues
of the American missions In Bulgaria and
Macedonia have been their best friends
throughout the troubles. There is no lack
of indications that Prince Ferdinand is
Imperiling his own position by permitting
such license -to the committee as to enable
it to blackmail, prominent people in sup

Consul General Dickinson, when here on

CARSON, Nev., Oct. 8.â "Word was re

the Indian who murdered William Dang
berg in Alpine County, California, about
a year ago, has been killed by his broth
er. Only last week Joe Pete murdered his
father-in-law and nearly killed another
Indian in the camp.
Joe Pete was arrested for the murder of
Dahgberg, was tried and convicted and
the day set for his execution. Then he
made his escape from the County Jail.
Rewards aggregating $2000 were offered
for his capture. He was heard from many
times, but the white men did not care to
attempt his capture in the mountains and
the Indians \u25a0would not lend assistance.
After the murder of Joe Pete's father
in-law recently the tribesmen held a con
sultation and appointed Pete's brother as
the one to kill the' murderer. The brother
executed his mission early this morning,
slaying Joe Pete in his hiding place in
Alpine County.
The State of Nevada has had a standing
reward for Joe Pete, dead or alive.

last night forced to retire with his audi

citizens have adopted this means of retir
ing the orator and his disciples. Last
night the operation was conducted from
the roofs of adjoining buildings. The, fire
was carefully directed and although the
orator received more eggs thaoi would
have sufficed to insure his silence and
withdrawal, his audience and even a few
spectators were not overlooked by the

Dr. Singer of Santa Barbara, a member
of the State Board of Pharmacy, was
among those present in the circle of spec

James M. Beck, acting Attorney Gen

for the information of United States Im
migration Commissioner Hart North re
specting the: authority of his office over
alien sailors landing at this port. Beck
advises North that it is in his power to
make such examinations take such
precaution as may be reasonably neces
sary to prevent any alien immigrant,
whether he be a sailor or not, from-enter
ing this country in the sense that all im
migrants. enter, it. An alien immigrant of
the prohibited classes does not escape the
operation of the statutes because he ships
as a seaman. This ruling does not refer
to alien sailors who have arrived here in
the pursuit of their calling and are await
ing their departure, but if they- ship as
seamen as a convenient method of secur
ing passage to this country and for the
purpose of entering therein as other alien
immigrants, then they are passengers, and
as such subject to the usual examination
and the capitation tax of onÂ© dollar.

she was dissatisfied with the way he was
conducting- the business. He left, but re
turned last Saturday night and- took $92
out of the safe. She ordered him to re

and given terms of from twelve to eight

Army officials are very much puzzled at
the unusual number of desertions which
are occurring among the troops stationed
at the Presidio. Within the last two
months several men have quietly left va
rious companies of the Eighteenth Infan
try. A few have deserted the Fifteenth
Cavalry and the new batteries of artillery
which are being organized in San Fran
cisco have suffered In like manner.
The soldiers at the Presidio have better
quarters and are better fed than at most
military stations, but It is proverbial in
army circles that enlisted men cannot
stand good treatment. Extra precautions
are being taken to discourage the deser
tions. The offenders when apprehended
are severely punished. Some of the men
surrender themselves and many re-enlist
In other organizations. Very few of the
men who desert, however, are caught, for
the. department cares little to keep such
soldiers in the service.

cording to the arrangement adopted by
the managers of the party. Max Goldberg,

Supervisor Charles "Wesley Reed, who
was turned down by the late Democratic
convention, has about made up his mind
to enter the race for Supervisor as an in
dependent candidate. He is told by many
of his supporters that the people are long
ing Icr an opportunity to vote for him,
and he may decide to afford them the de
sired gratification. He fancies that the
nineteen hundred names required for his
petition can be readily obtained.

The executive committee met later in
the evening and each of the fifteen mem
bers thereof was authorized to select
twenty delegates to the convention.
There was gossip last night to the effect
that the non-partisans would nominate
Reginald AVebster, Superintendent of
Schools, for Mayor; William Broderick
for Auditor, and W. A. Deane for County
Clerk. In order to preserve the organiza
tion for service in the next campaign one
candidate whose name does not appear on
any of the existing tickets will be nom

The local campaign is to be enlivened
by another convention. Last evening sup
porters of the Non-Partisan Municipal
League met at Lodge Hall. .1605 Polk
street, and. authorized the league's execu
tive committee to appoint delegates from
each Assembly district to assemble at
some suitable hall on Friday evening of
this week and proceed to the nomination
or indorsement of a municipal ticket. The
meeting last night was attended by forty
interested citizens. Nathah Bibo presid
ed. Animated speeches were made by ex-
Senator H. V. Morehouse, A. B. Tread
well, E. R. Peace and Charles G. Nagle.
The orator of the evening- was Senator
Alcrehouse, who said: "We want to ef
fect an organization which shall be a
factor in .the control of the city and give
to the public an honest administration of
municipal affairs. We want San Fran
cisco to stand as one' of the finest cities
of the world. Let us organize a move
ment in which men who appreciate the
honor and standing of the city may. put
their hearts, their souls and their ener
gies. We are not .seeking Republicans or.
Democrats to perform party service, but
we want men irrespective of party affilia
tion who will honestly and efficiently per
form public duties."
Among the allegations in the petition
were that Pierce had obtained a fee of
$3800 for practically doing nothing in the
case and that Wolf had given large fees
to other counsel without any apparent
necessity for doing so.
I desire now "to enter an absolute denial to
the allegations of the petition and the state
ments of its author's attorneys, both for my
self and Mr. Wolf. I say that the instrument
on its face shows its-falsity; that nothing can
excuse the wantonness of its misrepresenta
tions. The Intention of the attorney who drew
the petition' cannot be misunderstood. He
makes oath to its contents, and. It appears,
a iree and voluntary oath.i If I were guilty
of the imposition on the court that is charged
by Mr. Pope, if Mr.' 'Wolf were, if any of
the things charged were true 'we would be
the lowest of scoundrels, unworthy of the re
gard of even the meanest of men.
There would be my place (pointing to the
dock) and not for long, for the State has pro
vided a place for just such a scoundrel as I
would be if what is charged here by Mr. Pope
were true. I shall not again address the court
in this matter as an attorney, my - position
until a hearing, is concluded belnff that of a
witness, but I shall ask this courUafter a full
investigation of the facts ot the case, of -my
acts and of Mr. Wolf's acts, under- its seal
and under its honor to write its word against
those who are the Bcoundrels in this case.
And I shall ask this court to name the person
responsible for these baseless charges.
Ex- Judge Slack, who appeared as coun
sel for Pierce and Wolf, after argument
was sustained by the court in opposing
the petition. He insisted on the investi
gation being proceeded with at once, but
Attorney Pope begged for delay and the
matter was continued till Friday.
The allegations made in the petition of
Mrs. Mary Brunning or Brunnings for a
change of venue formed the grounds for
words of severe denunciation by Attorney
W. L. Pierce In Judge Cook's court yes
terday, when the case was called. Attor
ney Francis Pope represented the peti
tioner and Attorney Pierce was counsel
for the trustee of the estate. Attorney E.
Myron Wolf. Mrs. Brunnings was sent
to the insane asylum some years ago and
she has now -been restored to capacity..
Attorney Pierce, in addressing the court,
said: .
Attorney Collins objected to the testi
mony on the ground that the claim was
irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent
because the indictment charged that the
claim had been paid in money, while the
testimony was to the effect that it had .
never been paid at all, but had been off
set by material furnished to the Selby
people by the Mint. The objection was
overruled. *
Collins on the cross-examination called
the attention of- the witness to the fact
that on the preliminary examination be
fore United States Court Commissioner
Heacock he had testified that the bill had
been changed on the suggestion of Super
intendent Leacn^over the. telephone, who
said that it would facilitate their (the
Mint people's) bookkeeping. The witness
admitted that ihe transcript of his testi
mony was correct and that l^each" tele- ;
phoned two or three days after the wit
ness had received the penciled request
from Dimmick. He added, in response to
a question by Attorney Denson, that Dim
mick had never been authorized by the
Selby Smelting and Lead Company to
collect $498 37 or any other sum for them.
Frank A. Leach, superintendent of the
Mint, was the next witness. â¢â¢ Leach ex
plained the transaction of the $498 37 and
said that he had ordered Dimmick to call
the atetntion- of the Selby people to the
bill for 1536 05 and request them to divide
it so as to have one of the bills 'wiped
out" by credit, fcr material. The witness
feared that unless this should be done his
accounts might be confused. On the cross
examination the witness admitted that
that was a correct method of dividing the
bill.
. The court adjourned until 11 o'clock this
morning 1 .
â¢ The opening statement for the Govern
ment was made succinctly and impres
sively by Attorney Woodworth. He ex
plained that the amount mentioned in the
indictment was a balance against the
Mint for bluestone furnished by the Selby
Smelting and Lead Company. This bill
was paid by the Government to the Selby
people March 26. lfHX). and on April 7 of the
same year Dimmick presented the bill to
Cashier Cole of the Mint and .received
$49S 37, when Dimmick, at the sanie time,
knew that the bill had been paid. This
nioney he converted to his own use- for
almost a month.
Theodore Gray, principal accountant
and bookkeeper of the Selby works at the
time of the transaction mentioned in the
indictment, was the first witness for the
Government. He testified that a bill dat
ed March 20, 1900, for $636 05 had been sent
back to the Selby Company.-with a note in
pencil in Dimmick's handwriting affixed,
requesting the Selby people to segregate
the bill into two, one of them for $498 37
and the other for the remainder.
Collins Interposes an Objection.
Prosecution States Its Case.
The prosecution was conducted by Unit
ed States District Attorney Marshall B.
"Wcodworth, Samuel C. Denson and . Bert
Schlesinger. George D. "Collins appeared
for the accused. .
The following named were sworn In as
jurors to try the case: Jeremiah Deasy,
A. B. Clute, George N. Hind. William J.
Casey, William Schroeder, James Hogg,
F. P. Cutting, R. Chartrey, Samuel
Schwartz, A. A. Schneider, William H.
Stevens and J. J. McNamara.
The trial of Walter N. Dimmick, ex
chief clerk of the United States Mint,
was begun yesterday before a jury in the
United States District Court on an indict
ment charging him with having presented
a false and fraudulent voucher for $498 37
on April 7, 1900, and with having convert
ed the money to his own use for the peri
od of elmost a month. . â¢
During recent months copper discov
eries have been made in the Siskiyou
Mountains which give rich promise. Cap
ital was plow tn invest in them, be
cause it was believed they were merely
superficial offshoots from the Shasta
belt. Notable discoveries have been made
at Preston Peak and along Joe Creek.
Isear the Oregon line some rich copper
prospects have been opened. The an
nouncement that the great belt on which
Delamar finds ore running 33 per cent
copper actually extends through the ter
ritory in which the new discoveries have
been made will cause an inflow of cap
ital to the more northern regions and the
rapid development of properties. By
next spring an army of prospectors will
have invaded the Siskiyou Mountains,
and the discovery of copper mines as
great as those of Shasta may result.
Since the first copper mining in this
county it has been maintained that the
copper belt extended from the Bully Hill
section in a northwesterly direction to
Backbone Creek, nea/ which the Bala
klala, Shasta King, Mammoth and Fri
day-Lowdon are situated, and then
turned southwesterly to Bully Choop.
The examinations by Anderson "and l>u
bols have convinced them that the true
belt extends from Bully Hill northward
through Siskiyou, and. curving back near
Ashland, Or., runs south through the
Backbone country. Thev will present
their data in the official bulletin.
REDDING, Oct. S.-Professor Frank M
Anderson and Peter C. Dubois, mine ex
perts serving as assistants to the State
Mining Bureau, have made some discov
eries which proclaim the general theory
of the great copper belt of this county
to be in error, and which indicate that
the copper district is of far wider scope
than had been supposed. Their Investi
gations, made in the interest of the cop
per bulletin, to be issued by the State
Bureau, shows that come recent surpris
ing copper developments In Siskiyou
County and Southern Oregon are upon
the same belt on which the famous mines
of Shasta are located.

What ShaH
We Eat
To Keep Healthy and Strong;?
A healthy appetite and corrAnon senss
are excellent guides to follow in matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
<^Â£\ .- '
and meats is undoubtedly the best, in
spite* of the claims made by vegetarians
and fcod cranks generally.
As compared with grains and vegeta-
bles, -meat furnishes the most nutriment
in a highly concentrated form and is di-
gested and assimilated more quickly than
vegetables or grains. . ..* . .
Dr. Julius Remusson on this subject
says: Nervous persons, people run down
in health and of low vitality, should eat
plenty of meat. If the digestion is too
feeble at first it may be easily strength-
ened by the regular use of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets after each meal. Two of
these" excellent tablets taken after dinner
will . digest several thousand grains of
meat, eggs or other animal food in three
or four hours, while the malt diastase also
contained in Stuart's Tablets cause the
perfect digestion of starchy foods, " like-
potatoes, bread, etc., and no matter how
weak the stomach may be, no trouble will
be experienced if a regular . practice is
made of using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
because they supply the pepsin and
diastase so necessary to perfect digestion,
and any form of indigestion and. stomach
trouble except cancer, of the stomach will
be overcome by their daily use.
That large class of people who come un-
,der the head of nervous dyspeptics should
eat plenty of meat and insure its cora-
plete'digestion by the systematic use of a
safe, harmless digestive- medicine like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, composed of
the natural digestive principles, peptones
and diastase, which actually perform the
work of digestion and give the abused
stomach a chance to rest and to furnish
the bedy and brain with the necessary
nutriment. Cheap cathartic medicines
masquerading under the name of dyspep-
sia cures are useless for relief or cure of
indigestion, because they have absolutely
no effect upon the actual digestion of
food.
Dyspepsia in all its forms is simply a
failure of the stomach to digest food and
the sensible way to solve the riddle and
cure the indigestion is to make daily use
at meal time of a safe preparation which
is indorsed by the medical profession and
known to contain active digestive princi-
ples, and all this can truly be said of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
All druggists throughout the United
States. Canada and ; Great Britain sell
them at the uniform price of fifty cents
for full treatment. -.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Conditions in the Butter and Egg markets
have 'not changed for some little time. Deal
ers are pressing up prices for both as fast
and far as they can, in order to work off their
Eastern and storage stock, and It must be con

successful. Still, both markets lack snap, and
the medium and lower grades are Inclined to
drag. Cheese remains steady and unchanged.

NEW YORK. Oct. 8.â The conflicting or
varying movements of prices in the stock mar
ket to-day showed that speculative sentiment
was considerably unsettled. The impressive
buying of yesterday, which came from a few
concentrated sources, evidently made an im
pression on professional traders. They .were
inclined to take the view that the wavering
movement of the market yesterday was a cul
mination of" the downward movement, large
bear interests taking advantage of a raid on
leading stocks to cover their short contracts.
Influenced by this conviction there was a dis
position to cover short lines to-day. A drive
against Sugar and Brooklyn Transit after the
early . strength unsettled this conviction but
the bears had evidently lost their aggressive
spirit and did not pursue their advantage but
took occasion to cover their short lines again
Prices touched the highest late in the day,
but the situation once more overcame the specu
lators and prices sold off again, making the
closing easy. . The signs of an oversold condi
tion of the market were balanced against the
persisting doubts and dread that the money
market resources are not sufficient to save the
situation for the remaining period of interior
demands for currency. Back of this lies an
apprehension In some quarters that the present
reactionary tendency of the market may mark
a step in a prolonged downward movement
preliminary to a coming cycle of declining
trade and Industry, following the culmination
of the late period of prosperity. Even suppos
ing such a period has fairly set ln the normal
course of the decline is sure to be punctuated
by occasional upward reactions. Of special in
fluences at work to-day the publication of the
unfavorable August statement of earnings of
Brooklyn Transit was regarded as the culmina
tion of unfavorable conditions for that stock.

Late mail advices from New York say:
â¢â¢Thare is no improvement in the California 1
situation on new raisins and practically no j
likelihood that there will be any change in j
the outlook before the end of the week at j
the earliett. One large local Jobber is under- j
etood to have secured a few cars of new goods ;
at the prices sent out from the ccast Saturday, j
but no others can be found who were as |
fortunate. At present it Is very doubtful if j
any orders placed even at the first low prices !
named on Friday would be confirmed. A coast j
dispatch states that leading growers are seek
ing an injunction to restrain the association I
and the i ackers lrom delivering raisins at the
prices named. The spot market is unchanged,

The Weather. and Crops.
The Weekly report of A. G. McAdle, section
director of the climate and crop service of
the weather bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The temperature continued below normal dur
ing the first of the week, but warmer weather
prevailed toward the close. Light rain has
fallen in portions of the State, and there were
thunderstorms in many places on the 1st
and 2d.
Grain thrashing and hay baling are nearly
completed in all sections, and the heavy crops
are now being moved rapidly. There has been
l>ut little loss from the recent rains. Hops
are nearly all baled and under cover. Bean
harvert is progressing rapidly and at present
the prorpects are good for an unusually large
crop. Sugar beets are yielding a good crpp.
New grass and volunteer erain have made a
B^ood start since the rain. Irrigation water is
pkntiful.
Raisin making and fruit drying are in prog
rrys. Tbe&e crops were not seriously injured
by the rain, as ample warnings- had been given.
Apples are yielding excellent crops in all the
northern districts and in some places the yield
is reported the largest for five years. Citrus
fruits are in excellent condition; in Butte
County the orange croy will probably be. su
perior to that <jI last season, owine to the !
absence of severe winds. Walnuts are yield- ;
Ins well. .
â¢ COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â The weather
has been generally favorable for all late crops
and for fruit drying. Light showers at the
beginning of the week caused but little dam
age, but late grapes in some places have been
considerably injured by rain. There were
thunderstorms at Calistoira and other places
on the 1st. Bean harvest is progressing rapid
ly, and the yield ie resorted very heavy in
seme . sections. Hops' are mostly baled and
under cover; there is a large crop, excellent in
quaiity. Sugar beets are yielding a good crop.
Grain and hay are now moving rapidly, and
the greater part of these heavy crops will be
raved; there are daily shipments by steamer
from San. Luis Obispo. The correspondent at
Arroyo Grande estimates that the srain crop
in 6outheaptern San Luis Obispo County and
northern Santa Barbara County will be not
less than one million sacks of two bushels each.
New erass and volunteer grain have started
up finely. There â¢will be a heavy crop of winter
pineapple muskmelons at Calistoga. Grape
picking continues. Apples are yielding an ex
cellent croo in Sonoma County.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.â The first part of
the week was cloudy, 'With light showers, and
the latter Part clear and warm. There was a
epvrre thunderstorm and heavy rain in portions
of Tehama County on the 2d. The rain has
caused .but little damage to cror>s. Plowing
Is progressing In some sections and Fumtner
fallow seeding has been quite extensive on the
bottom lands.. The train, hay and hop crops
are practically all Gathered and .under cover.
Mountain Â»applPs are abundant in the vicinity
of Red Bluff, and said to be the heaviest crop

.WHEAT FREIGHTS â A ship has Just been
taken for Europe, usual options, at 36s 3d,
which is now the quotable rate. The chartered
wheat fleet ln port has- a registered tonnage of
84,820, against 47,180 tons on the same date last
year; uisengaged, 13,692 tons, against 1600; on
the way to this port, 180.340 tons, against 142,785.
WHEATâ Liverpool and Paris futures were
both higher. The visible supply of the world,
according to Bradstreet's, increased 1,748,000
bushels, as follows: East of the Rockies, an
increase of 2,348,000; Europe and afloat, a de
crease of 600,000.
Chicago was quiet' and featureless. There
were more sellers than buyers." Northwestern
receipts were 500 cars less than last week. Later
on the market became firmer and the shorts
were made nervous by reported buying for
French account. There was an urgent demand
for winter, but a poor demand for spring
wheat. The advance for the day was %c.
Conditions in the local maket remained about
the same, futures improving and shipping
grades standing unchanged.

OATSâ The. market rules firm. The Govern
ment will probably take from 1000 to 1500 tons
and the Fueet Sound and Oregon markets are
both higher. The scarcity of Oats in the West
and Southwest this year has advanced the price
of Oatmeal there to a point where it cannot
be shipped to California, and as our usual lib
eral importations of this product are shut off
our local Oat market is naturally firm inde
pendent of the Government demands. Then, as
previously mentioned, the termination of the
strike has led to increased feeding of horses,
so the situation is strong all around. The
world's, visible supply, according to Brad-
Street's, decreased 1,139,000 bushels last week.

CHICAGO, Oct. 8.â Wheat* was dull for the
first two hours' of trading, December opening
a shade to %@%c lower on indifferent cables.
The traders had expected a buoyant cable list
after yesterday's bulge. , and when they were
disappointed they began to feel the influence of
the bearish conditions that have prevailed for
the last week. ' December sold off early to 69%a ]
Then reports of buying for the outside account,
especially of May for the Northwest, coupled
with buying by prominent local bulls, . began
to frighten the shorts and a rise was the re
sult. Profit taking near the close eased De
cember and it closed firm at %c advance at
70%@70%c.
Corn was weaker at the opening, partly under
the lnliuence of prevailing expectation of a
free and- early movement of the new crop. The
dull trade and absence of any* considerable de
mand also had a depressing effect. December
closed weak, %c- depressed, at 56%c.
Oats had a dull and featureless market. De
cember closed unchanged at 3o?Â»c.
Provisions were dull and lower, Influenced
by a continued selling of the outside account
and' lower prices for \u25a0\u25a0 hogs. January pork
' closed .17%c lower, lard 12%c down and ribs
7%c depressed.

well; oranges will be of better quality than
last season's, owing to the absence of severe
winds. .
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.â Monday ? was
cloudy, with light rain, which did very little
damage to drying fruit, owing to timely warn
ings; the remainder of the week was clear
with pleasant days and cool nights. The con
ditions have not been very favorable for raisin
making, owing to the cool nights and heavy
dews. Large quantities of grapes are moving
to wineries. Two or three weeks of warm,
clear weather will cure the greater part of
the raisins now on the trays. The crop is
generally good. Prunes and peaches are about
all cured. An unusually large crop of hay has
been harvested and is now mostly under cover.
A good crop of sweet potatoes is being har
vested. In some portions of the valley plowing
and seeding grain are progressing, but gen
erally the ground is too dry. Feed and
are plentiful, and stock of all kinds is in
rood condition.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â The weather
has been generally clear and cool during the
week, and favorable for fruit drying, raisin
making and bean harvest. Beans were not
damaged by the rains of the preceding week I
and will yield a good crop. Harvesting and !
haying are completed. The hay crop is above
average. Barley is of rather poor quality, but
yielded a heavy crop. There are good crops
of corn and vesetables. Walnuts are heavier
than usual, indicating good quality. Apples
and pears are nearly all gathered and have
yielded good crops. Citrus fruits are doing
well.
EUREKA SUMMARY.â New grass is making
fine growth. Grapes and tomatoes were con
siderably damaged by rain. Apple gathering
is in progress. Some fall -plowing is being
done.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â Weather is
favorable for crop gathering. Walnut picking
is in full blast; cood crop. Bean cutting and
beet hauling nearly ended; some beans being
thrashed. Orange crop well advanced; peaches
are nearly cone.

The local packers are again In the market foT
Hogs, receipts of which are now lighter. Prices
are unchanged. The packers say that the sick
ness among Hogs in the northern part of the
State has been very much exaggerated. . and
that more Hoes have been reported lost there
than can be found In the whole State. They
further say that they are not buying any Hogs
that are sick, or even in poor condition. a3 no
packer would be foolish enough to buy any
Hog that was likely to die on his hands, es
pecially when the margin of profit is so narrow
as at present.

The steadying of the raw copper market in
London seemed to affect Amalgamated Copper
favorably. There was "also a report of a set
tlement with contending Interests. The death
or the Ameer of Afghanistan was a depressing
lactor in the London market, which was re
flected here. Movements in the foreign markets
were decidedly confused. Consols dropped
sharply and the fall in sterling exchange at
both Berlin and Paris seemed to reflect some
withdrawal of capital from London, this in
spite of â¢ repurchases for Paris account inj the
London stock market. Interest rates also de
clined in London, notwithstanding the install
ment of subscriptions due on the new consols
on Friday, which amounts to 123,000,000. Ster
ling exchange in New York continued firm,
which was probably the dominant influence in
the decline in money rates at London. The
recent reports of a coming increase in The
Atchison dividend rate persisted to-day, but
that stock showed less firmness than others in
the list and closed at a net decline. St. Paul
was conspicuously strong and there was a re
newed advance in the Vanderbilts. The late
reaction, however, was universal.
Railroad bonds shared in the irregularity of
stocks. Total sales J2.275.0OO.
United States bonds were all uncCihged . on
the last call.

bride's parents, was. one of the very
pretty events of the season. The decora
tions, which were placed under the direc
tion of Mrs. Woodworth, were unusually
artistic; bamboo, long- fern plumes and
huckleberry foliage forming an effective
background for a lavish arrangement of
pink gladiolus and amaryllis. Tall bam
boo branches were arranged to form a
bower lined with pink Duchess roses,
while overhead a great true-love knot of
white tulle held in place a large bell of
the same filmy material.
Here the bridal party stood while the
Rev. Robert Ritchie, rector of St. Paul's
Episcopal Church, read the solemn mar
riage service. ,
The bride wore an elegant gown of
heavy white satin, the. long train being
outlined with a drapery of tulle and or
ange blossoms. The bodice showed a
berthe effect in rare lace. The tulle veil
was quite long and the shower bouquet
was of lilies of the valley.
The bride's only attendant was her
sister, Miss Bessie Palmer, who was
gowned in pink liberty silk over pink
taffeta and carled Bridesmaid roses. Rob
ert M. Fitzgerald- of San Francisco was
best man. Little Elizabeth Adams, a
niece of the groom, preceded the bridal

The profits of the big project are to be
estimated as closely as possible, and if
they be inviting the trust company is
ready to begin immediately.
Between Redding and Red Bluff
stretches thirty-five miles of land which,
though not all valuable, will under irri
gation grow almost everything. Strayer' s
Idea is to procure as much of this land as
possible and bring water upon it by a
large ditch taking its supply from the
Sacramento River at this city. The.
topography favors its construction. The
land would be subdivided into small hold
ings and families brought from the East
to farm it.
As an additional inducement to home
seekers, Strayer plans an electric railway
giving easy access and ready means of
transportation. An important feature of
this road would be that it would give the
rapidly expanding city of Redding con
nection with the head of navigation on
the river.
REDDING, Oct. 8.â A great trust com
pany is making investigations regarding
the largest Improvement project yet un
dertaken in Northern California. It em
braces the acquiring of all the rich bot
tom lands between Redding and Red
Bluff, the digging of a great irrigating
canal between the two towns and the
paralleling of the canal with an electric
railroad. The company having this scheme
in mirid has been forced to the Paciflc
Coast to find large investments for its
surplus and Is attracted here by the min
ing activity of Shasta County. Its repre
sentative, J. N. Strayer, has made a brief
visit to Redding and arranged with agents
for procuring all the data necessary to
determine the feasibility of the scheme.

In the event of a Grand Jury investiga
tion Saloon-keeper Solari will find him
self In an awkward position, being com
pelled, if called upon to testify against
Newell, to confess himself a bribe giver.
In that connection Councilman Cuvelller
has opened a fight In the City Council
against the granting of Solari's applica
tion for a liquor license. The petition,
which was recommended by the Munici
pal License Committee, of which Council
man Boyer is chairman, was laid over at
the Council meeting last night. It was
then said that there would be an investi
gation of the charge of bribery- Newell's
action to-day eliminates him from the
case so far as the Mayor is concerned,
but the Council has not yet done with So
larl'e application.
James W. BaTIard. formerly County Li
cense Collector, now in the liquor busi
ness on Broadway, is a candidate for
Newell's position.
I have no statement to make. See the Mayor.
After leaving the Mayor's office Newell
declined to supplement his resignation
with any explanations. He said:
No Statement From Newell.
I simply told Mr. Xevrell what were the cir
cumstant-es of the care as reported to me,
and he made some explanations which might
or might not tend to explain.
1 told him that Solarl had flatly accused him
of exacting money, and that there were wit
nesses who would give testimony tending to
corroborate the charge. Under the circum
stances I decided that Newell must resign or
be removed. Ke decided to resign and that set
tles it to far as I am concerned. If the Grand
Jury desires to investigate the matter, that Is
not within my province. It is up to Solari
v.ovr, so far as further action Is concerned. I
have done.
The resignation followed immediately
upon the conclusion of a conference be
tween Xewell and the Mayor at the City
Hall this afternoon, the suspended in
spector having, after four days' delay,
gone to talk over matters with Mayor
Warsto'w. Newell was advisedâ in fact
his friends demanded last nightâ that he
make a statement to the Mayor, even if
he did. not desire to make a public expla
nation of his lealings with Saloon-keeper
Solarl, who charged him with extortion.
Before Newell met the Mayor this after
noon Couneilm^n Fitzgerald, the former
inspector's sponsor, visited his honor,
and was shown the evidence which the
police had gathered iri the matter. Fitz
perald left the office and an hour later
Newell arrived to make his showing.
Mayor Barstow said to an interviewer:
Hon. Anson Barstow, Mayor of the City of
Oaklandâ Dear Sir: Learning that certain com
plaints have been made against me regarding
my official action, I desire to emphatically deny
the truth of said assertions, but for the sake
cf the peace and harmony in your able ad
ministration, and not desiring to obstruct same
in any way or manner, I hereby tender my
resignation as License Inspector, to take effect
from date hereof. Fully appreciating all your
kindnees to me. I am, Tours respectfully.

Talks With Mayor First.
The document by which Newell volun
tarily severed his connection with the
municipal government reads as follows:
OAKLAND, Cal.. October 1 8, 1901.
It Is left for the Grand Jury to uncover
the facts connected with â¢ the accusation
of bribery against License Inspector Tim
othy J. Newell. Without demanding offi
cial inquiry or public Investigation con
cerning the serious charge, Newell, who
had been suspended, .stepped out of his
position to-day, his resignation being
handed to Mayor Barstow.

The examination of the physician occu
pied all the afternoon and will be con
tinued to-morrow morning.
"They indicate a hyper-sensitive condi
tion of the bram due to excessive drink."
"I think his condition was an unnatural
or.e for him. He had been addicted to
drink so long: that he was not in a natural
state unless he was intoxicated."
"What do you think these illusions and
hallucinations that are spoken of here
sr.ean?"
District Attorney Allen asked the wit
ness In cross-examination what effect the
continued use of alcoholic liquors had on
a human being.
"It first acts on the brain," was the re
ply. "It produces gradual changes In the
brain structure that finally result in im
pairing the faculties. The liquor acts by
absorption and reaches the brain through
the blood. It disturbs the equilibrium."
"What do you think Adams' condition
was during his periods of sobriety?"
r.e never would have done if he had been
Rar.e. He thought he was being attacked
by demons and he was so frightened at
one time that rls hair siood on end. One
of the Episcopal clergy here testified that
he eang in an upstairs room in his night
clothes while the family was at breakfast
and another said he drove around the city
In a sulky, arrayed in a long coat and silk
hat. His daughter tells how he crawled
about his home on all fours, barking like
a dog.
"Now, all these things taken in connec
tion with the raan's uncle's insanity, tend
to show that he was unbalanced â they are
not things that a well-balanced man of
the cloth would do. Taking into consid
eration Adams' career, the fact that his
brain and body were subjected to a con
stant drain, that his will power had about
become exhausted, that he suffered a
series of attacks of delirium tremens and
that his periods of sobriety were few, I
should say that his mind had been de
ranged to such an extent that he had no
command over his faculties and that he
had no realization of the nature of his
crime when he ehot Dr. Jeseup. In other
words, he was insane when he shot Dr.
Jeesup."
Drunkenness His Natural State.
"One of the results of his habits was to
rnake him have Illusions and hallucina
tions. He frequently mistook his wife for
his daughter and his daughter for his
wife. Alter hia wife was aead he called
his daughter by the wife's name, having
The Illusion that she was still living. He

Illusions and Hallucinations.
"I base my opinion upon the ancestry
of the man, his history as related by his
daughter and his excessive drivking hab
its. 1 find upon reviewing his liie that
when he entered the ministry he was well
c-ducated and full of zeal lor his work.
Within a few years he had become ad
dicted to drink. He exhibited unusual
Bymptoms, at times being very excitable
and at others morose and drowsy. He
frequently ha<l delirium tremens, which
certainly had their effect in destroying his
faculties and intellect.
Attorney Church, for the defense,
broached the subject of Adams' sanity by
reading to Dr. Hatch an extended hypo
thetical question, dealing with Adams'
heredity, his excessive use of intoxicating
liquors, his habits, his inebriety and all
his actions prior to the shooting, to
which the witness replied that in his opin
ion the person described must have been
insane and wholly incapable of appreciat
ing the enormity of his crime.
"Will you please explain why you think
so, doctor?" asked the attorney, and Dr.
Hatch replied:
Expert testimony, designed to establish
;he theory th;it Charles G. Adams was
:nsane at the time he shot Dr. John G.
Jessup was introduced %y the defense to
day in Adams' trial for murder. Dr. F.
W. Hatch, president of the State Board
of Lunacy Commissioners, taking the wit
ness chair and asserting his belief in the
irresponsibility of the accused when ho
fired the fatal shot." Dr. Hatch has been
a spectator of the proceedings of the trial
eince it began and his opinion as to Ad
ams' sanity is based upon the testimony
of the several witnesses who reviewed
events in the lif? of the accused man, and
a personal examination of him since his
incarceration in the County Jail.

Charles R. Roesch. 505 Pacific avenue
Rev. Frank S. Brush of the First Presby
terian Church officiated. The bride was
attended by her sister. Miss Eva, as
bridesmaid, and another sister. Miss
Louisa, as maid of honor. She was at
tired in a gown of white silk mull over
white silk and wore a tulle veil, caught
with an orange blossom spray. Her bou
quet was one of Bride roses. Jonathan
Floyd supported the groom. Mr. and Mrs
Nissen will reside here, the groom being
employed in the postoffice.
Miss Mabel TrcthÂ«>way became the bride
of "William Isidore Macdonald this even
ing at the home of the bride's parents,
Mr. and Mrs. F. Tretheway, at 1120 Tenth
avenue. The wedding was a home affair
and was attended by only a few of the
many friends of the couple. /
The Tretheway home was decorated in
pink and green, and with the bright light
ing made a pretty appearance. The Rev
XV. H. Frazer of the Brooklyn Presby
terian Church performed the ceremony
The bridesmaids were Miss Evelyn Bunt
ing. Miss Elsie Macdonald, Miss Adelaide
Resseguie and Miss Blanche Morse. Miss
Edna Tretheway, the sister of the bride
was maid of honor. Seth Talcott, a close
friend of the groom, was best man.
The bride is a graduate of the Oakland
High School, class of 1899, and has many
friends in Oakland. She possesses mus
ical ability that has given her no little
local reputation. Mr. Macdonald is a
graduate of the State University and is
in business In San Francisco.
The groom is a well-known young news
paper man, connected with the business
department of a local newspaper. He has
many friends in Oakland.
On their return from a short honeymoon
at Del Monte the young couple will reside
at the Hotel Crellln.
She wore a large white hat of panne vel
vet, trimmed with ostrich plumes.
J. Cal Ewing attended the groom and
the ushers were: J. A. Bittel, Harry
Bridgeman, Harry Keeler, Clarence
Crowell. XV. H. Dickerson and Charles
Beck. . .
Yee Ting admitted that he fired the
three shots last might. He claims to be
a cousin of the murdered man, Yee Kit,
and says that Yep Suey, at whom he shot,
was one of the trio that shot Yee Kit.
Yee Kit, who was shot on Saturday
night by gunmen of the Suey Dun Tong,
died last evening at the Emergency Hos
pital. The tong to which Kit belonged at
once took up the work of revenge and
three hours after he died highbinders
made a bold attempt to murder Yep Suey,
a prominent member of the rival organi
zation. Three shots were fired at Suey.
None of them took effect, but the pistol
was placed so close to his body that hi?
hands were powder burned and his clothes
took fire. Yee Ting was arrested by Offi
cers Tyrell and Tillman and charged with
the crime. The shooting took place at the
corner of Dupont and Washington streets.
Both tongs now at war are branches of
the See Yup Society. The latter organi
zation made an effort to settle the diffi
culty before any more blood was spilled,
but the death of Yee Kit caused a sudden
renewal of hostilities. The war is now on
in earnest and the police think much
murder will be done before a settlement
can be effected.

Colonel John P. Irish and Andrew Fur

In all of Its aspects beneficial to the labor
ing classes?" last night before the Men's
League of the First Congregational
Church of Oakland. The lecture room of
the church was crowded with an audience
of men and the partisans of the two
speakers frequently applauded their re
spective champions.
Some acrimony crept into the argument,
and once the efforts of the chairman.
Giles H. Gray, were necessary to restore
order. â¢
The debate was opened by Mr. Furu-
Eeth, who defended labor unions as a po
tent and necessary factor In industrial
evolution. Colonel Irish replied in a
forty-nve-minute speech, in which he
argued that trade unionism was opposed
to the spirit of our institutions. Mr. Furu
seth spoke in rebuttal and Colonel Irish

A slight change has been made in the
management of the depot quartermas
ters department since its , separation
from the army transport service. Cap
tain Nathan P. Batchelder, who has been
serving as assistant depot quartermaster,
has been relieved and assigned to duty
as quartermaster on the army transport
Sheridan. As the transport is not yet
ready for sea and may not be for some
time, owing to the strike conditions ex
isting, other service may be ordered for
Captain Batchelder in the meantime.
There have been no changes made in
the army transport service and, accord
ing "to General u. F. Long, who is in
charge of the service... none are con
templated.- The service is now in a high
etate of efficiency and the transports of
the United States Government are leav
ing this port on regular time.
Some few weeks ago it was decided to
separate the depot quartermaster's de
partment and the army transport service.
General Long, who was depot quarter
master before the war and who organ
ized and managed the United States
army transport service over the Pacific
Ocean, was given the choice of service.
Having organized the transport service
he felt a natural pride in the work and
chose to remain in charge of the vessels.
Colonel Miller was then made depot
quartermaster and is now in charge of
that department. It was in the separa
tion of the work a^id officers of the two
departments that Captain Batchelder re
tired from his old position.
The trans-Pacific transport service is
now the only transport service that the
United States Government possesses. The
service to Cuba and Porto Rico has been
done away with, the few soldiers that
are being transported between the United
States and those points being handled
by the commercial lines. But the trans-
Pacific service has been put on a regu
lar sailing basis and has been left with
General Long for management. When
the Hancock left last week that vessel
sailed on the two hundred and fifty-fifth
trip that has been made from the port
of San Francisco by army transports in
about two years. There are now fifteen
transports plying between San Francisco
and the Philippines and among the isl
ands, all handled from this port. The
service has been gradually reduced to
this figure though at one time there were
nearly fifty, vessels, employing about 10,
000 men, making a small army in itself.
It was this service that. General Long
built up and which he is now reducing
to the lowest limit that is consistent with
the work required of it by the Govern
ment. During all this time not a* single
life has been lost in crossing the Pacific
Ocean these many times.
"There are no changes that I know of
contemplated in the transport service,"
said General O. F. Long, "since the ser
vice was separated from the work of the
depot quartermaster. Some slight
changes have been necessitated by that
separation, but nothing of importance.
Of course the transport service is being
reduced to the lowest and most econom
ical limit consistent with a good service,
but that is all."
LIMA. Peru. Oct. S.â It is asserted herÂ©
on reliable authority that the greed of Bo
livia has been excited by the wealth of
the SantO/ Domingo mines, which are the
property of the Inca Mining Company, an
American organization. The Bolivians de
clare that the mines arc on Bolivian terri
tory, which they assert extends to the
lnambura River.
The Government of Peru is determined
to oppose this contention firmly. To-mor
row the new Peruvian Minister to Bolivia.
Dr. Felipe Cama, will proceed to La Pass,
the capital of Bolivia, to discuss the issue
as well as other questions.

partment Is Made a

e<-!e or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at borne.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect cf warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, givingr strength
end development just where it Is needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success in
a':l cases. A request to the State Medical

them to gee how easy it is to be cured of
fic-xual weakness when the proper reme-
dies are employed. The Institute makes
, iio restrictions. Any man who writes will
Y>" sent a free cample, carefully sealed in
a plain package, so that its recipient need
have no fear of embarrassment or pub-
licity. Readers are requested to write

Ladewig, when given a chance to talk,
denied every accusation made by his wife.
The case was continued by Judge Sea
well until 10 a, m. to-day. , â , !
Mrs. Ladewig had a number of wit
nesses, principally relatives, corroborate
her testimony concerning the beatings
and maulings.
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Ladewlg have had
anything but a peaceful life since their
marriage. The testimony given by Mrs.
Ladewig's relatives before Judge Seawell
yesterday showed that kicking, beating
and choking have occupied most of the
time of the couple, with wordy wars in
which "yellow dog" and "gol darn brute"
and other choice bits of English were the
weapons.
Mrs. Ladewig took the stand In her own
behalf and told the court that her hus
band came home drunk, swore at her,
knocked her down and choked her. She
also told of him reciting stories of his be-'
ing the object of the affections of all the
women clients who visited the office of
Bovee, Toy & Sonntag, where he is" em
ployed, and that one of the women
brought him pleated shirts, fancy stock
ings and pretty neckties.

be charged on aTid after November 1. 1901.
The board further finds that a reasonable
profit for such transportation by the defendant
corporations from Bakersfield and all points in
California north of BakerEfleld and south of
San Francisco to San Francisco would be and
is 4 2-10 cents per barrel, or 12% per cent net
\u25a0profit per barrel, and that snch profit in view
of the extent and volume of the business of
transporting crude petroleum, as presented by
the evidence, is a reasonable, fair and Just
unouit to be allowed to and charged by the
defendant corporations as such net profit, and
that a rate of 37 S-10 cents per barrel for such
tranri citation from Bakersfield and all points
in California north of Bakersfield and south
of San Francisco to San Francisco would be
a reasonable, fair and Just rate to be allowed
to and to be charged by said defendant corpo

The above entitled cause came on regularly
for decision this 8th day. of October. 1901, pur
suant to adjournment, heretofore regularly
taken. Evidence, both oral and documentary,
having- been by ail parties heretofore presented
to end received by this Board of Railroad
Commissioners, all parties being at all times
duly represented at each and every hearing,
and the cause having heretofore been regularly
submitted and taken under advisement by the
board, from the evidence taken the board finds.
based ur>on the figures presented by the de
fendant, corporations that the cost to the de
fendant corooratlons of transrortir.g crude
petroleum by theic respective railroad lines
from Bakersfield to San Francisco, a distance
of 314 miles, 33 5-10 cents per barrel, and that
euch cost is less from points on their respect
ive lines north of Bakersfield to San Francisco.
This cost is calculated UDon what, as ap
plied to this particular haul and freight, this
board believes to be for the defendant corpo
rations a most "liberal basis of estimate, but
is nevertheless for the purposes of this case
accepted by this board.
The board further finds that the charge by
the defendant eorr>cratione to the shippers of
euch crude petroleum for transportation there
of from Baksrsfield and all points in Califor
nia north of Bakersfldd and eouth of San
Frnnoisco to San Francisco is a uniform

The shippers of crude petroleum from
the Bakersfield district have won a signal
victory over the railroad companies that
carry oil from the valley points to San
Francisco. For several months the case
of John Le Blanc against the Southern
Pacific and Santa Fe railroads has been
waged before the Railroad Commission.
The best attorneys in the law depart
ments of the public carriers were called
Into service and the case was tried with
earnest legal and forensic force.
It is now all ended. The real point of
contention was whether the rate of 42
cents a barrel charged by the railroads
was unreasonable or not. Two of the
Railroad Commissioners have found that
it was. They ascertained that the profit
of carrying amounted to 8 4-10 cents on
every barrel of petroleum. Tbis has been
pronounced unreasonable by two of the
Commissioners â C. S. Laumeisler and E.
B. Edson; so they have fixed a new rate,
which will take effect November 1, at
37 S-10 ceitts per barrel.
N. BlackstocK in a voluminous opinion
dissents from the decision on legal
grounds and concludes that the complain
ant has failed to show that the former
rate is unreasonable or to establish
gToundss that would justify the board in
setting aside said rate and promulgating a
new one in its stead.

Luther Burbank, propagator of the Bur
bank potato, of the seedless prune and
countless other varieties of vegetables
and fruits in this State, was honored yes
terday by the State Board of Trade. Bur
bank Is known as the wizard of the soil.
In Europe his reputation Is J widespread.
On one occasion, so it is authentically re
ported, when his name was mentioned,
the entire French assembly rose to its
feet in his honor as a benefactor of man
kind. If it is Indeed true, as a famous
writer has it, that he is twice blessed
who makes two blades of corn to grow
where one grew before, then Burbank is
entitled to be considered several times
blessed, for he has made many things
grow, edible and delicious, that were
never imagined before his magic skill and
knowledge caused them to come into ex
istence.
The State Board of Trade has decided
to make a complete collection of samples
of every form of vegetation to which his
name as propagator can be attached and to
keep a permanent exhibition of the same
at the rooms of the board In the ferry
building in this city. To carry this out.
Colonel John P. Irish, C. M. Wooster of
San Jose and B. M. Rowley of the Cali
fornia Fruit Grower were appointed a
committee. The Board of Trade at its
meeting yesterday also authorized W. H.
Mills and Secretary Filcher to make ar
rangements for storing at St. Louis the
portion of California exhibits now at Buf
falo that will be in shape to show at the
St. Louis Exposition in 1903.

robust health. He is full of life ana vital
ity and does not need to undergo \u25a0 any
building-up process such as a boxer would
require who had neglected himself for any
length of time. Jeffries has little to learn
about boxing or lighting, so that branch of
nis exercise can safely be cut down to a
minimum.
Ruhlln is in the same condition as Jef
fries. He has lived temperately out of
doors and will work into lighting condl-
The only matter in abeyance now is the
selection of a referee. It is generally un
derstood Harry Corbett will be' the man
il he can be prevailed upon to accept. The
club and the lighters want a local man
for referee. This shuts out the Los An
geles man who has retereed some minor
nghts down there and whose name was
mentioned in connection with the big
light.
The details preliminary to . the Jeffries-
Ruhlin championship fight were advanced
considerably yesterday. Most important
of all. "Billy" Delaney deposited with
Harry Corbett,. the stakeholder, Jeffries'
forfeit of $2500 in coin to guarantee his

November 15. This date was fixed abso
lutely.

12. I recommend a vote of thanks to Dr. E.

tire expense of sending a delegate from the
department of pharmacy to the meeting of the
American Pharmaceutical Association in St.
Louis. The department was represented by its
dean. Dr. W. M. Searby.
11. It affords- me much pleasure to report the
gift to the department of pharmacy from a
number of friends of cash donations amount
ing to $650 for the library and equipment fund
of the post-graduate course, and in addition a
gift of 281 pharmaceutical books, periodicals
and pamphlets for the department library. Mr.
H. E. Law has presented to the university a
Schumacher duplicating machine, with inter
changeable dies and necessary accessories. This
will prove a very useful addition to the equip
ment of the pharmaceutical library. The raa
ckine represents a money value of $200. I re
commend that a vote of thanks be extended to
Mr. Law.
10. I recommend a vote of thanks to the heirs
of Professor Joseph Le Conte for their generous
gift, to the university of the bulk of his library.
The collection contains many well-nigh In
valuable . books, periodicals and scientific pa
pers. An exceedingly \u25a0 Interesting part of the
gift is the index rerum. an extraordinarily full
card index to Professor Le Conte's scientific
reading for the past fifty years.
Generous Gifts to University.
9. That Dr. Robert Orton Moody be appointed
assistant in anatomy at $1000 for the current
academic year. I recommend that of this sum
$300 be supplied from the amount appropriated
for the department of anatomy, and that the
remainder be taken from the funds of the med
ical department. Dr. Moody was born in Buf
falo, N. Y.. in 1864; studied in the Buffalo High
School, and afterward In the Buffalo State Nor
mal School; entered Cornell in 1885; graduated
from Cornell in 1891 with the degree of, B. S.

Yale. He spent the following year in New York
in graduate study. From 1895 to 1900 Dr. Moody
