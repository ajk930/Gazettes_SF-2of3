around inside the tree so that he was quite
invisible, and there he blazed away
through the crack with his telescope rifle
as easily as from a porthole. He was a
deadly shot, too, that fellow: he killed
thirty-five or forty of our men and came
out himself with a whole skin.
The cause of that battle lay with a
bunch of outlaws. They were whites, but
they had acted in a way that would have
disgraced Indians. They had Jellied, mas
sacred thirty-five squaws, poor, helpless
things who were camped on Bear Creek.
So the bucks started on the warpath, no
blame to them, but they killed a lot of
good men instead of the outlaws. They
made for the first white man's house they
came to; It belonged to a man named Har
ris. It was a double-storied hewed house,
pretty good for thereabouts. Harris and
his wife and the little 2-year-old girl wera
at home. The woman, with the Judgment
that women have, tried to eet her hus
band to stay inside; but no. he was going
out to fight those thirty-five Indians. As
he opened the door they shot him down.
Â©V course. The same fire that killed him
wounded the little girl. Mrs. Harris picked
up the child in her left arm; a pistol was
grasped in the right hand. For two days
and nights that woman" stood off the In
dians from her home and her baby, and
was still standing them off when we ad
vanced and took up their attention. That's
the kind of stuff that women of the West
were made of in early days.
It was later on after much more trouble
that we returned to Big Bend and \u25a0 tried
to make a treaty. While we were camping
one night a friendly squaw stole through
the close trees and bushes to our camp
fire, and she warned us that attempt at a
treaty was in vain; but we persisted and
held our camp. The result was that nine
men were killed on guard and we had the
dickens of a time until Captain Ord was
relieved. Then we licked them, and in the
end the conquered Indians helped carry
our wounded to the hospital at' Port Or
ford, and. we conducted the Indians safely
to the reservation In tha Willamette Val
ley.
Presently a big Indian, a sulky looking
brute, came into the' camp with a paper,
which he handed to';' the --colonel. His
squaw was along with -him. When the
colonel looked at the paper he discovered
that it was a neatly made out death war
rant for the bearer. We never knew for
certain who made out that warrant and
the others that followed, but we always
supposed it was the old priest. Father da
Bmet, who was in the confidence of Spo
kane Gerry. At -any rate, none of tho
bearers knew the contents, but had evi
dently been given some fictitious explana
tion; of them \ by their chief, who had
picked- those he considered. the most easily

It was when Colonel Wright took hold
of -matters that- there: was a grand -set
tling. He said that the Indians woull
have to pay for a life with a life, and he
told old Spokane Gerry, the bif chief, so.

kind that are packed by. mules. There was
nothing else to 'do with them.

swam our horses over. When we were
within two clays of Spokane River we met
forty or I fifty mounted Indians. .
"We have killed* two beeves," their
spokesman told us, "and the first beef was
for peace and the second beef was for
war."
That was what we had expected and we
were pleased enough. When we had rid
den a mile further we came to three or
four hundred, and they all wanted to fire.
We went right on and-paid no attention
to them at first; they followed along near
us, and when we had pitched camp, on the
lake they began in earnest. They kept
firing right into the camp all night and we
barelv held out. â¢
Early [in the morning we started out,
they- aft^r.us. We. got into a canyon; its
sides' were perpendicular and we looked up'
to see abo/ve a great row of savage faces.
They had us, had us tight, and they.didn't
mean to /waste;thelr opportunity. We were
penned in- like sheep and they were firing
as fast as they could load, straight into

hold out any longer. - .
Word <:ame from Father d e . Smet : .''I
have dorje all I can; my resources are at
an'end." He was the old French priest
and a good man he was; he had a tre-'
mendoua influence over the Indians and he
had used it as far as possible to avert thii
massacri that they were attempting.;
Help from the colonel came in time to
prevent Its being carried out in full. With
a reinforcement we managed to make our
way out of the canyon and we stood off :
2000 Indians in the timber. We retreated

the other day as I was sitting in the park
one of the art -students came along and

It seems a wonder that I have dodged
bullets the way I have; f Seven wounds
are all, and most of them were slight. I
was struck by a spent ball several times,
and I call that getting off easy.
At the close of tne war, in '65, I went
back to Indian fighting, and .1 quit twelva
years later. I had enlisted when I was a
boy of 18. and I had kept on in the army
until I was getting toward middle age.
and I thought it was about time to quit.
So I drifted back to the mines and I've
been there ever since, except when I taka
it into my head to go off hunting for a

been proud that I -was, under Sheridan,
and I served under, a lot more big men
besides. There were Generals Stoneman,
Buford, Merritt. Pleasanton, Palmer. Mc-
Clellan, Burnside and Hooker. In Indian
warfare I served under Generals Crook
and Miles.
When it came to the real fighting It was
so hot and heavy that %e just fought
straight ahead, and we hardly knew what
we were doinj. I remember how wÂ«

rebs were behind It blazing away. They

man. I'll never forget the way that squaw
looked when : she saw her lord and master
- violently borne away. 'She. gave one wild
shriek, then she took a firm grasp of tho
spear she carried! It was a beautiful
â¢spear.-' so. remarkable that I had been
â¢looking at it all the'time. It was stained
a deep red, set with brilliant stones anil
' decorated about the handle with rare
feathers. She took a perfect at the
colonel and whizz went the spear. By
" dodging he got only a slight wound. The
â¢weapon shot past: him and stuck in tlie
tent. \u25a0
One after one Indians bearing death
.warrants filed in and were promptly
seized, much to their surprise. One after
"one we bumped them â strung them up,
you know. At one time we had thirty
five hanging to various trees, and the
. place has gone by the name of Hangmans
' Creek ever since. "Before we got througn
with the business we hanged as many
270 in different "camps. ,
Nevertheless Indian outbreaks were far
from finished when, the Civil War arose,
and I was sent off to the other side of the
continent. .
I can't name anywhere near all the bat
tles I was in between '61 and '65. There
was Antletam and the seven days' fight,
and McClellan's retreat and Chancellors
ville, and, worst of all, there was Gettys
burg.
;That was fighting for you. For twenty
three days while we -were in the Gettys
burg region .we never ,- -unsaddled our
horses. For twenty-three days we never
took our clothes oft. "We rode night
and day, with an- hour's stop now
and then to feed our horses or our
selves. Then "boots and saddles" would
be sounded and off we would go again.
"Vta had plenty to eat. but little enough
time to eat it. We had pork, coffee and
crackers, for rations. The crackers were
about >four~4nches square and we had
twelve of them a day. The horses had
plenty, of grain but no hay. -
IT took me twenty years pf hard fight
ing to live through 165 battles and
skirmishes. Those years are over now
â I'm glad enough of that â and there's
nothing left to tell the tale of them
except seven scars and my name â "Old
Trailer."
I've been Old Trailer so long that I have
to 6top and think and take a pull or two
et my pipe before I can remember my
other name, the or.e I got back in Massa
chusetts sixty-six years ago. It is Arthur
S. Kitchenâ yes, that's it; but I don't
think much of it as a name. I never have
any particular use for it. Old Trailer's
good enough for me.
I sot that name 0:1 account of the Indian
â¢wars I've been through. There was a
plenty of them; counting skirmishes and
battles together it comes to an even sixty
eeven. I had more tights in the Civil War
â ninety-eiprht battles and skirmishes be
tween '61 und '65; but somehow they never
made fo much repression on me as the
Indian fights did. They weren't so horri
ble. 1 began Indian lighting- in 'Z2 and I
kept it up until '77, barring the four years
it took 10 put down the Kebs. So it's no
\u25a0wonder, is it, that 1 see Indians being
bumped now and then when I'm asleep,
and that I sometimes wa.ke yelling that
they're going to make me run the gaunt
let or burn me at the stake?
They never did either of those things to
me, but they came j:rÂ£tty near it plenty
of times. I must have l:ad some kind of a
mascot that brought n-.e through all right.

I fooled around in the mining country
until 'Â»3, then I enlisted in the. regular
ermy end west out to tackle the Indians
of the north. It was up there, all around
Oregon and, that country, that I was kept
busy with the reduMns.
My first fight was on Hungry Hill, near
Cow Creek, in Oregon. There thirty-five
of those good for nothing Indians defeated
600 American soldiers, and 133 of them
were regulars, too. It was lack of disci
pline that was responsible for the whole
trouble. I was a green one mfaself, .and J

The small cajlber, of course, enables a

the advantage of the %mall caliber is neu
tralized. This refers to calibers below 7.5
millimeter, as compared with one of S
millimeter. Again, the S raUihncter pro^
jcctile (with the same muzzle velocity)
will be superior to the smaller calibers at
lpng range?, tccau.ee it will retain u
greater energy and will be leas affected
by air currents acting across the plane of
lire.
It may be possible, perhaps, to con3truct
guns of very small caliber (under 0.3 inch)
which will fulfill all requirements, but tho
present indications ore th,at the rifle of
the future will have at Ka3t a O.U13-inch
bore and probably yreatc;'. \u25a0
The question of-a practical sight h at
least aa important as that of caliber. Tha
sight should be very simple in construc
tion, admit of quick and certain adjust
ment for every range and of easy super
vision by the squad leaders, and possess
an extended field of view. Above all, U
should admit of quickly catching the tar
get, wlilch would indicate the open rtne
sight as the best. such, for example, as Is
used in sporting* rifles, where tl\o same
quality of quickly catching the target
comes into play.
Anotner requisite is a simple and rella
bWÂ» range finder, since the best sight may
prove dead capital without it. Finally,
The surgeons of these wars are unani
mous in the opinion that these modern
projectiles are really as humane as was
reported when they were first adopted.
Even as early as the Graeco-Turkish war
Pr. Edmond Lardy reported that "our
small-arm projectiles did not arrest the
cavalry at all. and the infantry only very
inadequately." And Dr. Hildebranut, sur
geon in the Royal Prussian Infantry, re
ported in regard to the South African
war: "More than a third of the wounds,
unless the projectile strikes a nerve or
large, vessel (which Is rare), are so light
that the wounded are able to march on,
and even to continue to fire, while the
pain Is scarcely felt. In case of horses,
even wh.en fatally wounded, they can go

cally constant pressure while the projec
tile is in the here.
It may be assumed as nulte certain that
in the near future the infantry arm will
utilise the force of rÂ«coll to open, com
press and close the breech mechanism.
.Vntil the proper propelling agent Is
found, however, tt will be impossible to
construct a suitable Infantry arm of this
kind.
The question of caliber has also came
up again. The Spanish-American and the
South /African wars have sl;own that
small-aim projectiles of 0.?36, 0.276 and
0.303 inches diameter produce. In tho ma
jority, of cases, wounds which do not t put
the wounded out^ of cction even tem
porarily, not to speak of incapacitating
them for a war of any considerable dura
tion. '
INFANTRY ARM OF THE FUTURE
Tho small arm of the future will, there
fore, weigh about 7.15; pounds (without
bayonet), its caliber will be .815 to .3TJ
inch; it will have a bolt block, a movable
(but not detachable) magazine holding
five or sis rounds, a simple rinsr sight,
with an arrangement to prevent flrtng too
hish, and a p'.stol grip. The plates, bands,
etc., will be qf magnalium or some similar
light metal, and the bayonet a four-cor
rje-red dagger. '
Tliis U the weapon which the modern
authorities on tactics would *.ke to see in
the hands of the Infantry soldier, and ba

The tcU ami the movable (but not de
tachable) magazine will remain, as they
have proved their efficiency.

there must be an arrangement "to prevent
tiring too high: it is much less important
to continually ratao the ballistic power cf
a firearm than it is to arrange it so that
the soldier is automatically compelled , to
tiro approximately right. : This matter haa
been referred to. by many high authorities
of late. The Belgian Lieutenant d'Aout
says: "Give the soldier as soon as possi
ble a gun which approximately points It
self." Lieutenant General Rohne of tho
Pvu?*ian army adds: "I consider it quite
pcs&lble to construct a rifle which can be
lited or.l,'\at elevations under 2 or 5 de
grees, civlng Â« maximum range of 1070
yards, and entirely preventing firing at
elevations now possible. Of course, this
is only for ordinary use: there must also
be a special arrangement to. admit of the
U3f of higher angUs," It Is believed that
ordinarily no range over 1750 yards will
be required, and the modern graduations
to 2190 yards art- of no practical use.
WHEN the present small-caliber
rifles were first intr-jdueed there
were many criticisms! on all aides,
but gradually ttae c/itica became
eilent and, the new weai.um was accepted;
â¢without further objection.; â¢
The outer form of- the various models
constructed between- 1S88. and 1889 Is ma
terially different from t-hat of earlier
types. Tho addition of a jacket or man
tle for the tube and the attachment of the
magazine, however, were not conducive
to a convenient, shape of the rifle, al
though a more convenient form is much
desired by the soldier.
In, tbe last decade it lias T^een found that
the outer jacket could bt> dispensed with
and the weight thereby considerably re
duced, at the same time giving the piece
a more manageable form.
Reduction of weight ha3 been the con-
Etant effort of the manufacturer and in
ventor of late years, and it is greatly de
sired for service. The present models vary
In weight from eight pounds to 9.02
pounds, the United States Krag-Jorgen
sen weighing 9.353 pounds. High authori
ties are of the opinion that it is not ask
ing too much of manufacturers to have
this weight reduced to 7.15 pounds, and it
Is believed that this will be the weight of
the Infantry riflo In the near future.
The objection that this will Increase the
shock of recoil too much will not hold, as
it can be overcome by finding a proper
propelling agent. The Vetterli gun (model
of 1S0S-81). weighing 1,0.14 pounds, had a
foitre of recoil of 1.2 metcr-kllograms, and
did not incommode tho J soldier. The
Mauser gun (model 1895), weighing 8.7
pounds, had a recoil of but 0.S5 meter-kllo

2Velvet is, .to be . worn . a great, deal' in
hats, but a soft French felt is more fash
ionable and consequently more expensive.
The jvery . soft, -limp felt, is decidedly
gcarco'here as it 1h all imported directly
from Paris. The stiff . ones fail to look
The only trimming on it-is some extra
long Sweeping black and white aigrettes.
It takes about ten of them to make any
kind <if a showing where they are used as
the only trimming. They sweep from one
side across to the other, where a few. of
them 'are lightly tacked so as to hold
them In place. The only other touch of
color is added by a capsion which hides
the rough ends of the aigrettes. It is an
exceedingly simple hat, but- very, very
swagger looking. , -- . â¢
sion there are about one hundred rhine
stones, and as they are set Individually
in white metal, what luster they havens
shown to the best advantage!
The |rhlnestones make a pretty contrast
against the hair. Somebody said that the
pompadour was going out, but with the
hats Off the face they are more stylish
than ever. The* head of the Emporium
hair-dressing parlors -says that the hair
is not J popular low, but these hats demand
that-the snace at the back of the neck be
filled, j for the hats are off the face and
the broad brim at the back gives an ex
ceedingly awkward appearance.
Black and white still continue to be
fashionable, and when was it not con
sidered swell looking? One of Madame
Pouyanne*s.hats is of the two colors. The
entire hat is made of ribbon about an inch
wide. Each piece is put on slightly gath
ered, and increases until the wide : brim
is reached. The llnlH" is the same, so the
gathered effect is carried, out in the en
tire hat. . -

But the trouble with both of these hats
is that they require handsome gowns. An
ordinarily pretty frock would look very
common, and the hat Itself would â¢ lose
some of its exquisite daintiness.
An old favorite, the Napoleon, has re
turned with Increased vigor. They are
here in every conceivable color, but the
prettiest are of blue. When the brim la
is made of chenille appliqued with span
gles a eplendid effect Is produced. The
crown is ordinarily made of blue tulle.
To supply a contrast the brim is outlined
with black velvet, and there Is a large
black velvet rosette with a capsion on tha
very front. This- Napoleon, by the way,
Is new in one respect. It has only four

the soft stuff, white chenille alternates

One side rails completely over the. crown
and fastens in the center of it with a
large rhinestone capsion. A yard and a
quarter white plume leaves Its hiding
place from under the roll and circling the
brim takes refuge on the opposite side.
It Is a most curious hat to pick up and
glance at casually. Which Is the front
and which is the. bs.ck is a question in
one's mind. Naturally the black roll Is
selected as the back. Just because it turns
up so suddenly, but in reality that is the

and soften the face, and It fullfills its part
of the contract.
The pattern hats are very apt to look
a wee bit theatrical, but extremely'at
tractive withal. A very beautiful even-
Ing hat is made of blue panne velvet.
Just a large frame draped entirely with
the panne, and a large full feather that
measures a yard and three-quarters laid
softly about the brim. There isn't an
other thing on it, not a buckle, nor eyÂ»n
a pin; in fact, the feather Is its cnlef
beauty, and anything would detract from
it. Paris says it is a typical Florodora
hat, and Paris certainly ought to know.
bound to look swell. Small hats are sim
ply non est.
- These pompons are going to be extremely
fashionable, and probably very much run
into the ground in consequence. The os
trich ones are by far the prettiest and
the best, but there are others made in a
variety" of material. Black and white
mixed, or either one color or the other,
are in the lead. On plain felt walking
hats taffeta is used in what we used to
call a rosette, but the edges are frayed
a trifle and the silk falls in a free fashion.
Brown is going to be used somewhat in
millinery. One of the Paris models is a
large brown shape turned up. on one side.
The entire crown of the hat is covered
with a large bird." The lining is made of
the ' new ostrich ..trimming. It resembles
tiny ostrich feathersâ just the smallest
imaginable ones. In reality the trim
ming comes by the yard and Is - a little
over an inch wide. The other colors, pink
and a .pale castor, are used -as -a drape,
and where the hat rests on the head is a
large crushed bow. of the old-fashioned
Persian ribbon.
Each and every hat that bears the real
Parisian stamp is well worth giving
minute attention. It is a mystery how
so; many, . many hats can be turned, out
and not. one of them' look the. least- bit
like any other. It certainly is an art, and
Paris has quite perfected it,'
Lace, by the way, seems to be used very
little excepting .when it is combined with
fur. The other soft trimmings are either
chiffon or tulle, and both are very per
ishable. : Taffeta is not as soft oF as
graceful, and fails utterly on a swagger
hat. Panne, felt and feathers are just
about the proper thing, but the way they
are put together makes all the difference
in the world.
Silver tinsel appliqued on black velvet
makes a showy hat. A round brim liber
ally covered with the glittering stuff "looks
well with any kind of an evening gown,
and any afternoon frock, in fact. One of
the new soft, fluffy pompons is added to
give height.
gray tulle. There is fold upon fold alter
nating, one black velvet and the next
gray tulle. The frame is perfectly round
and the rows follow one. another until
they suddenly commence on baby tabs
that rest over the back of the hair. The
facing of the hat is black velvet, and it
is covered with real Arabian lace. The ef
fect is very lovely and one greatly appre
ciated by everybody, but particularly by
lovers of beau:iful and rare lace.
PARIS has sent over her semi-annual
load of bandboxes.
Have you seen' what is in them?
If you haven't it i3 about time that
you did. for most hats are com
mencing to look like the last rose, of sum
mer, and somehow, faded headgear Is. not
conducive to comfort;
But the winter hats! They are simply
dreams, that is all there is about it.
Quite the loveliest things you ever saw.
And, really, most everything seems to
be fashionable as long as It' is not small.
But that is an unpardonable error. Get
a cartwheel, put a feather, a few ai
grettes or a pompon on it, and it is

of his august majesty had five.
Meet of the new hats turn off the face.
The Xapoleon"'turns off abruptly, the Flo
irodora at an angle of about forty-five de
grees, and a Louise Pujol rolls gently^
But none of them, even the very best,
make any pretense at shading the Jeyes.
And by the way, perhaps you do not
know what- a capsion is. It is a French
ornament, and a very fetching- one at
that. To be exact, it looks like a ball of
diamonds. One half the ball is tucked
under the trimming, but the other half
makes up for lost time by glimmering and
sparkling for all it is worth. In each cap-
the same, but there are two very good
substitutes. One is a heavy broadcloth
stitched, and the other is called "scratch
felt." It is more woolly and is made over
a frame. Chenille is run through it at
regular intervals, and trie soft wires give
it a litt-.e support.
One reason of its sudden popularity Is
that it does not spot like velvet,, and it
can be turned and twisted and yet look
as well^as ever.
Fur and lace seem to be popular, but the
two are not combined alone. A' brown fur
is made up with ecru lace and baby pink
roses. The flowers rest against the fur
and the lace falls gracefully over the
combined two.

Any one who has had a copy of the first
"Who's Who in America?" has by this
time fully realized Its value and will wel
come the new edition of 1901-02. The first
edition was published to cover 1899-1900,
and met with such success that its editor,
John W, Leonard, and publishers, A. N.
Marquis & Co.. Chicago, have used the
experience of their first attempt to ad
vantage, and in this second edition pro
duced even a better book. "Who's Who?"
for 1901-02 carries out the scheme of the
first edition inasmuch that it is In every
way "A Biographical Dictionary of Nota
ble Living Men and Women of the United
States." One of those whose names go to
make up the^ work has in a letter to Mr.
Leonard described the quality of matter
in a nutshellâ "Careful, accurate; no bou
quets, no bricks." Of course, In a work
covering a field of 76,000,000 of people some

for all practical purposes the book is In

undoubtedly the best of ite kind that we
have in America; in fact, it contains mat

The scheme of the work Is this: You

living person of prominence. The boolt la
no index but turn directly to the person's
name and there you have all there is to

Who's Who in America.
When he leads his band he is happyâ he
feels that he is master. He spreads out
his arms and starts with the opening bars
of the overture. As the brasses and the
drums and the cymbals and the reeds take
up their parts he looks toward them and
commands them to begin. The music
swells on a wailing crescendo, and Crea
tore himself is transformed into a wailing
crescendo, swaying to and fro with the
rhythm. On, on, upwardâ ever upward he
goes with the music until the high level
ground of his purpose is reached, and
then, amid a deafening volume of crash
ing chords and harmonies, Creatore, the
dirty Neapolitan urchin, the soldier of
fortune, an outcast from the society of
men because he is a lover of music,
speeds swiftly along, happy, singing into
the mouth of his horn.
The world and things mundane are all
beneathâ forgotten. His soul is trans
formed by the music he commands. The
men behind the horns answer to his every
toucn and spring to their work with all
the fire of their nature. The ensemble is
deafening, the climax is reached, the last
chord is sounded and Creatore, the man,
comes back to earth.
Generally he is exhausted; sometimes"he
faints, for Creatore leads with his whole
soul. If the music glides his hand glides;
If the music is tremolo his whole body
quivers, while his baton never misses a
beat; if the music is dignified and slow,
he stands up majestically, and his tall
figure and long arms sway rigidly. But it
is In a grand finale that the gyrations are
the wildest. With the beating cymbals
and the flare of the brasses the white suit
of the leader flashes from one side of the
platform to the other. His black pompa
dour flies madly In the air; his arms beat
out with violence and precision. A trained
athlete does not endure a greater strain
than does Creatore when he leads his
band.
True, the boy did not know one note
from another.' The mysteries of harmony,
counterpoint and thorough bass were un
known to him. but he could play well the
music he had heard. "What astonished the
leader most was the passion with which
he played even the simplest things.
"There's promise in the boy," he said
at last, "and if he will work I'll make a
musician of him."
The boy did work. His trombone was
his only passion. Instead of playing with
wagons and toys be nursed his instrument
as if it were a baby. The hidden mys
teries of music were revealed to this boy
by one of the masters. It was the oppor
tunity that comes onoe in a lifetime to
very few, and although the boy did not
know its value he took advantage of it
and studied hard. â¢ A year or so later
Naples was astonished to s?e a 12-year
old trombone player in the best orchestra
in the country, playing solos from the
top of a box, for he was too small to
reach up to the music rack.
Such was the early life of Giuseppe
Creatore.
Creatore is a trvie soldier of fortune. lie
goes where the winds drive him, and the
money he earns goes, too. When he land
ed in America iie was "broke," but money
matters never worry him. He never
dreams of making a fortune. His whole
mind is wrapped i:p in making music. .
But he cares no more 'for his audience
than he does for the baton he breaks
every night. He knows nothing eise but
the history and literature of music, the
bounds of his instruments and the mes
sage his music conveys.

Creatore is a born musician. He has

ragged little urchin running wild on the
streets of Naples. One day an old gen

It was a simple little Italian melody, but
it was enough to show the old gentleman
that the lad had exceptional merit.
Forthwith he took him to Signor Man

the idea of a bareheaded, sunburned, dir

great charm of the first book was seeing
the world as it appeared to the eyes of a
young girl. This second volume, of
course, runs the risk that falls upon all
"second books" or "sequels." The mother,
is not nearly as interesting as Elizabeth,
and It must be said that the only pleasure
in reading her tetters is the satisfying
of one's curiosity as to just what kind of
a woman Elizabeth's mother could be. In
this way the interest comes rather by
reflection. The book would appeal to no

LOR already hr.s to his credit
a book of original poems and ft
scholarly translation of the Sonnets
of Heredia. His last work, a poem of
fifty-five stanzas called "Into the
Light," will probably attract more
attention than any of his other verses.;
partly on its own merit and largely
because it is similar in form and
treatment to the Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam. Dr. Taylor in these verses
has taken up the optimistic side of
life and spiritual advancement, as
contrasted with the pessimistic and
material views of Omar. With, re
rpect to the right side, of the argu
ment the doctor undoubtedly has the
advantage, but of course a compari
r-on cf the cne poem with the other
r.s poems is, entirely out of the ques
tion. Omar's work is that of a genius
â the poet who is born, not made.
."Into the Light" is good verse, care
ful verse, the work of the man of lct-
ters, perfect in rhythm tfud diction,
but it does not show the divine in
spiration, of the true poet. If it had
not been so direct an imitation of ono
of the greatest poems ever written,
"Into th,3 Light" -would invite, rather
favorable criticism, for it is rvidentiy
the result of a careful and sincere
effort.
Dr. Taylor is a Calif ornian and a
member of the San Francisco Bar As
sociation. "Into the Light" is pub
lished by Elder & Shepard of San

The young doctor's first meeting with
Ithuriel Butters is related by himself In
this wise:

want me sent for; in fact, the family had
done it on the sly, being alarmed at cer

"When I got there they kept out of the
way, evidently scared at what they had

In "Geoffrey Strong" Laura E. Rich
ards has given a little picture of life in
a small Eastern town that is as delicate
as a miniature painting on ivory. She
evidently knows her material through and
through; the sureness with which she
has handled every character, from the
debonair young doctor, who serves as hero,
to the hard-headed old farmer, whose
caustic remarks are worthy of a David
Harura, proves this.
A/i optimistic little love story is the
slight thread on which the story is hung.
It is not deep nor emotional; it deals
with the lighter phases, the superficial
ones of life for the most part; but it is
compact and flawless in construction and
both human and humorous. In fact. Miss
Richards has displayed a vein of quiet
humor unusual in the writings of her sex.

And last of all the author tells of the
real tragedy, the threat, the horror, of the
desert. It is creeping all the time. It 'bit
a piece off the sea, as we saw at the head
of the Gu'.f of California and licked it dry
till there was but a pillar of salt left. It
is creeping: on the lakes and drying them
out. leaving a mirage in the place. Its
sands are creeping over the forest and
choking them. It is the slow coming of
the end of the world. Of this he sajs
"Our outlook is limited, but have we hot
proof in our own moon that worlds do die?
What was the element that failed? Pef
haps it- was water. Perhaps it died
through thousands of years with- the slow
evaporation of moisture and th? slow
growth ofâ the desert." (Published by-
Charles Scribner's Sons, New York.)
But they are useful. these -desert
growths? Certainly they are. just as use
ful as : the pine tree or the potato plant.
To be sure man cannot saw them into
boards or cook them in a not; but then
nature has other animals beside man to
look after; other uses for her products
than supporting human life. She toils and
spins for all alike and man is not her
special care.
"The life of the desert lives only by
adapting itself to the conditions of the
desert. Nature does not bend the elements
to favor the plants or animals: she makes
the plants and animals do th6 bending.
The evening primrose must get used to
heat and drought, the coyote must go
without food and water for long periods.
Even complacent man fares no better
than coyote or cholla: he must endure the
same heat, thirst and hunger, or perish.
"Half the plant's on the desert put forth
their leaves with impunity: they are not
disturbed by either browsers or grazers.
Some of them are poisonous, many of
them are cathartic or emetic, nearly all
of them are disagreeable to the taste.
"So it seems with spines, thorns, var
nishes, resins and smells nature has
armed her desert own very effectually.
The little vegetation that grows in the
waste may not seem worth while, but na
ture does not think so. To her the cac
tus on the desert is just as important In
its place as the arrowy pine on the moun

"The deserts should never be reclaimed.
They are the breathing spaces of the
West and should be preserved forever.
To speak of sparing anything because it
is beautiful is to waste one's breath and
to incur ridfcule. The main affair of life
Is to get the dollar, and if there is any
money in cutting the throat of Beauty,

at its somber Syrian might of infinite
vast ness, beside which all works of man,
till even of nature's other spectacles of
mountain, forest, cliffs and waters, sink
Into melodramatic naught.
Van Dyke explains something of how
this !ov<=> of the desert grows on one. but
it must have been lived through to bs
rcaiiy fc!t. The traveler' who crosses on
the railrcsd will rover know why the .In
dians left the fertile watered glens of the
hills, or the rich valleys of the coast and
took to the desert to spend their lives
fighting with death.
In his preface he says:
"TJie love of nature is after all an ac
quired taste. One begins by admiring thÂ«
Hudson River landscapes and ends by
loving the desolation of the Mojave. Just
why cr how the change would be dim
cult to explain. You cannot always dis
fect a taste or passion. I shall never be
able to tell you of the grandeur of the
mountains nor the glory of color that
wraps the burning sands at their feet.
"So it is that my book is only an excuse
fcr talking about the beautiful things In
this desert world that stretches down to
the Pacific Ocean and across Arizona and
Sonora. - Â»
"The desert has gone begging for a
word of praise these many years. It
never had a sacred poet. It has in me
only a lover, but I trust that the nature
loving public will accept this record of
the Mojave and the Colorado as at least
truthful. Given the facts, erhaps the
poet and his fancies will come after."
To ore who thinks of the desert as but
cne thingâ 1 waste of arid, shifting sand,
"beneath that inverted bowl we call the
sky" â :t is wonderful how a writer can
t-crape enough out of it to nil a book.
The chapter headings partly explain.
Firstâ "The approach to the desert" as
one sees it in early morning, flickering
with its miragric illusions, cool and blue.
"The Make of the Desert." How it came
that a great upper end of the Gulf of Cal
ifornia was cut off by the silting deposits
of the Colorado River, which then
emptied into Its eastern side, and the
darcmed-in waters dried away, till the
Walton salt glacier is all that is left.
The topography of the bottom of the
bowl, all that is left of this truly "dead"
and gone sea, makes another chapter, and
the bottom of the sea is interesting even
tif'erthe sea has dried away.
A chapter on the Colorado River tells
how tr.at silent stream crawls past the
desert ruin it has wrought, sometimes to
tink silently into the sea, while again at
the full and change days of the moon it
meets the ocean waters angrily and casts
up a vast "bore" like that giant tidal

Une of the treasures of Hsueh Sung
Ying of the fraternity Is a likeness of his
17-ycar-old niece, who is still' In 'China.
Ho relates that at the time of the pro-
ration had already been begun on the
wall, and thrown artistically across the
bed was a gay quilt of patch work. In
posed Manchurlan treaty with Russia
public feeling was greatly aroused all
over China and a mass-meeting was
called at Shanghai, at which speeches
were made and resolutions made,^very
much as might be done in this country
under similar circumstances. He accom
panied his niece to this mass-meeting,
and during the enthusiasm she electrified
him by mounting the platform and mak
ing a ringing speech, full of fire and pa
triotism.
For a Chinese woman to address a pub
lic meeting was astonishing enough, and
the extreme youth of the speaker, as well
as her unexpected eloquence, made a
strong impression.
"Were you not very proud of her?" was
asked.
Mr. Hsueh looked a little dubious; very
much as one has seen an Amsrican boy
hesitate over admitting some achievement
of his small sister or cousin.
"Well," he admitted, "it was a good
Epeech. But I think she has been some
what spoiled since by flattery."
Another . large photograph shows the
mining class and professors of the Tien
tsin college,'' of which Hsueh Yung Sing
is a graduate.'
The upper portion of the fraternity
house is divided up into neatly furnished
bedrooirs, 'each containing two single
beds. The. rooms show very successful
attempts at decoration in the way of
photographs, draperies, etc.
One room was particularly interesting.
The bureau held many photos, some deco-
tne center of this quilt, arranged so as
to come over the sleeper's breast, were
the words in large, embroidered letters:
"The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
want."
A name for the fraternity has not been
decided upon. Professor Fryer suggested
"The Oriental." but the boys entered a
decided objection.
"There are a number of Filipinos anÂ«l
other foreigners In the university," ex
plained Mr. Hsue'h, "who have Just as
much right to be called Orientals as we.
This Is distinctively a Chinese society, and
we must have a name that expresses that
fact."
So the Question of a name Is as yet un
decided.
The Filipinos mentioned by Mr. Hsueh
form another Interesting feature of this
year's freshman class in Berkeley. Thera
are several of them, all members of good
families. One* of them is the son of a
member of Aguinaldo's former staff. Thsy

ands, came up to see him a short time ago.

that he was already forgetting his mother

learning and customs that they may re
turn to their own country thera perhaps
to become leaders and expound to their
own people the principles of Western civ
ilization.
It seemed advisable to keep them in one
community, and if possible under one
roof. Professor Fryer decided to ac
complish this by the establishment of an
Oriental fraternity, of which the new
comers will be the initial or charter mem
bers. The fraternity will be a permanent
Institution, will be given an appropriate
name and will doubtless grow year by
year as our national and commercial re
lations with China expand.
Whether China be divided up among
the nations or retain her own in
dividual life as one of the great empires
of the world, change has set in and is
bound to continue, both In her mode of
government and in the educational ideas
and customs of her people. It is believed
that Chinese subjects educated In Ameri
can schools and colleges will take back
to China American principles of educa
tion and government, and gradually these
new ideas will take root and become
formative agents in the regeneration of
China. Therefore the Installation of this
Chinese fraternity in Berkeley takes on
peculiar significance, and it Is Interesting
to know something of the members of the
new society.
A number of the young men are already
Installed In their new home on Durant
avenue. Of these seven have just ar
rived and one came on a few weeks ago.
Mr. Chueh entered last term and will
continue his course. As he resided last
year in the family of Professor Fryer he
will probably continue to live there,
rather than in the regular fraternity
house. He is a musician of considerable
skill and has a pleasing voice. He enter

handsome new house In Berkeley and will
shortly move into It his family, his house
hold roods and his household godsâ of
\u25a0which he has a fine collection.
He has also purchased a large house
near his own prospective home in which
he will domicile ten or more high-class
young Chinese entrusted to his care by
parents and guardians In China.
Lest alarm bo felt In Berkeley at this
double "Celestial" advent, It may be ex
plained at once that Professor and Mrs.
F"ryer are stanch CongTegationalists,
and their Quaint Buddhas and "Quan
yins** are cherished only as curios and
mementoes of a long sojourn In the
Orient, and not as household dletles, and

Last yea*-, however, he employed his
time in writing a booklet in Chinese, in
which he described tho California Uni
versity, dwelling upon its advantages and
high standing as an educational institu
tion. The booklet was illustrated with
engravings and received an immediate
circulation among the educated class in
China. Its result was apparent this year,
when officials of the Imperial Govern
ment came to Professor Fryer and be
sought him to take charge of a number
of young men who were desirous of com
pleting their education in this country.
Most of them were graduates of the Col
lege of Tientsin, which was destroyed

Ensang, who comes from the Honolulu
High School. Incidentally, he brings with
him seven medals, prizes won in athletic
sports In the islands. He has a record as
a sprinter, knows something of football,'
and altogether i3 likely to prove a wel
come addition to the Berkeley student
body on the athletic side. He is also a
fine musician, both on the piano and on
his native instruments.
Of the seven Chinese students already
at home in the new fraternity house,
Chun Chin Tao was a teacher in mathe
matics in the University of Tientsin. Wu
Tung Chao Is a civil engineer. Wang
Chung TIul and Hsueh Sung Ying are
graduated law students. Wang Chung Yao
is a mining engineer. Yin Chin Yung and
Wu Kui Ling were mining students at
Tientsin. Chan Yu Chuan was a law stu
dent at the same college.
The boys seem quite at home In their
new surroundings. They have nick
names for one another, one being known
as the "Theologian," another as the "Jur
ist," etc., and animated discussions are
being held in the attempt to decide upon
a suitable name for the fraternity. They
take readily to "Western customs and will
enter fully into the social life of the col
lege town. An invitation to tea at the
new "Frat House" will have a piquant
Oriental flavor which will add to the
favor with which such courtesies are re*
celjred by the young ladies of Berkeley.
The house purchased by Professor Fryer
for his proteges Is that formerly occupied
by Mr. and Mrs. Archie Pierce on Durant

THE ODDELT
COLLEGE FRATERNITYHe was more than astonished at himself
for having tricked her a few moments be
fore into a perfectly natural departure
from Indifference, She had been so re
served and so natural that he looked back
and asked himself what had happened to
flatter his vanity except a passing show
of interest. With this, he smiled and re
called similar opportunities in days gone
by, all of which had been turned to ad
vantage and had resulted in amusing pas
tjmes. And hare was a pretty girl with
an air of mystery about her, worthy of
his best efforts, but toward whom he had
not dared to turn a frivolous eye.
He took out the coin and leaned back
in his chair, wondering where it came
from. "In any case," he thought, '"It'll
make a good pocket-piece, and some day
I'll find some Idiot who knows more about
geography than I do." Mr. Lorry's own
Ideas of geography were jumbled and
vagueâ as if he had got them by studying
the labels on his hat box. He knew the
places he had been to and he recognized
a new country by the annoyances of the
Custom-house, but beyond this hnÂ» ignor
ance was complete. The coin, so far as he
knew, might have come from any one of
a hundred small principalities scattered
about the continent. Yet it bothered him
a little that he could not tell which one
He was more than curious about a very
beautiful young womanâ in fact, he was
undeniably interested in her. He pleas
antly called himself an "ass" to have his
head turned over a pretty face, a foreign
accent and an insignificant coin, and yet
he was fascinated.
to his section dizzily he thought of tho
good fortune that had been his In other
attempts, and asked himself why it had
not occurred to him to make the same ad
vances in the present instance. Somehow
she was different. There was that strange
dignity, that pure beauty, that imperial
manner, all combining to forbid the faint
est thought of familiarity.
Grenfall had formed many chance ac
quaintances during his , travels, some
times taking risks and liberties that were
refreshingly bold. He had seldom been
repulsed, strange to say, and as ho went
room. She became interested in the
search and bent over to scan the dark
corners with eager eyes. Their heads
were very close together more than once.
At last she' uttered an exclamation and
ber hand went to the floor in triumph.
They arose together, flushed and smiling.
She had the coin in her hand.
"I have it," >she said gayly, a delicious
foreign tinge to the words.
"I thank you ," he began, holding
out his hand as if in a dream of ecstacy,
but her eyes had fallen momentarily on
the object of their search.
"Oh!" she exclaimed, the prettiest sur
prise in the world coming Into her face.
It was a coin from her faraway home
land, and she was betrayed into the In
voluntary exclamation. Instantly, how
ever, she regained her composure and
dropped the piece into his outstretched
hand, a proud flush 'mounting to her
cheek, a look of cold reserve to her eyes.
He had hoped fhe would offer some com
ment on what she must have considered
a strange coincidence, but he was disap
pointed. He wondered if she even heard
him say: .
m "l am sorry to have troubled you."
*She had resumed her seat, and to him
there seemed a thousand miles between
them. .Feeling decidedly uncomfortable
and not a little abashed, he left her and
strode to the Joor. Again a mirror gave
him a thrill. This time it was the glass
in the car's end. He had taken but a
half-dozen steps when the brown head
was turned slyly and a pair of interested
eyes looked after him. She did not know
that he could tte her, so he had the sat
isfaction of observing that pretty, puzzled
face plainly until he passed through. the
door..
Under ordinary circumstances Lorry
would have offered her the : paper and
thought nothing more about it. With her,
however, there was an air that made him
hesitate. He felt strangely awkward and
inexperienced beside her; precedents did
not saem to count. He arose, tossed the
paper over the back of the chair as if
casting It aside forever and strolled over
to the opposite window and looked but for
a few moments, jingling his coins care
lessly. The jingle of the pieces suggested
something else to him. His paper still
hung Invitingly, upside* down, as he. had
left it. on tho chair, and the lady was
poring over her novel. As he passed her
he drew his right hand from his pocket
and a piece of money dropped to the. floor
at her feet. Then began an embarrassed
search for the coinâ in the wrong direc
tion, of course. He knew precisely where
It had rolled, but purposely looked under
the seats on the other side of the car.
She drew her skirts aside and assisted in
the search. Four different times he saw
the little piece of money, .but did not pick
it up. Finally, laughing awkwardly, he
began to search on her side of the car.
Whereupon she rose and gave him more
alive with fresh and Important dispatches,
chiefly foreign. At length, after allowing
himself to become really Interested in a
Paris dispatch of some international con
sequence, he turned his eyes -again to the
mirror. She was leaning slightly for
ward. Holding the open book in her lap,
but reading, with straining eyes, an arti
cle in the paper he held.
He calmly turned to the next page and
looked leisurely over it. Another glance,
quickly taken, showed to him a disap
pointed frown on the pretty face and a
reluctant resumption of novel reading. A
few moments later he turned back to the
first page, holding the paper in such a
position that she could not see. and, full
pf curiosity, read every line of the foreign
news, wondering what had interested her.
with his back to the door, his face to
the window, studied Its lettering.
During the afternoon he strolled about
the train,, his hand constantly jingling
the coins. He passed her compartment
several times, yet refrained from look
, ing in- But he -wondered if she saw him
pass.
At one little station a group of Indian
bear hunters created considerable interest
among the passengers. Grenfall was
down at the station platform at once,
looking over a great stack of game. As
he left the car he met Uncle Caspar,
who was hurrying toward his niece's sec-*
tion. A few moments later she came
down the steps, followed by the dignified
old gentleman. Grenfall tingled with a
strange delight as she moved quite close
to his side in her desire to see. Once he
glanced at her face; there was a pretty
look of fear in her eyes as she surveyed
the massive bears and the stark, stiff
antelopes. But she laughed a3 she turned
away with her uncle.
Grenfall was smoking his cigarette and
vigorously jingling the coins in his pocket
when the train pulled out. Then he
swung on the car steps and found him
self at her feet. She was standing at
the top, where she had lingered a mo
ment. There was an expression of anx
iety In her eyes as he looked up into
them, followed instantly by one of relief.
Then she passed into the car. She had
seen him swing upon the moving steps
and had feared for his safetyâ had shown
in her glorious face that sho was glad
he did not fall beneath the wheels.
Doubtless she would have been as solicit
ous had he been the porter or the brake
man, he reasoned, but that she had no
ticed him at all pleased him.
At Abilene he bought the Kansas City
newspapers. After breakfast he found
a seat In the observation car and settled
himself to read. Presently some one took
a seat behind him. He did not look back,
but unconcernedly cast his eyes upon the
broad mirror in the opposite car wall.
Instantly he forgot his paper. She was
sitting within five feet of him, a book
in her lap, her, gaze bent briefly on the
flitting buildings outside. He studied the
reflection furtively until she took up the
book and began to read. Up to. this time
he had wondered why some nonsensical
idiot had wasted looking glasses on the
walls of .a railway coach; now he was
thinking of him as a far-sighted men.
The first page of his paper was fairly
Grenfall'a ticket carried him by way of
Chicago. He caught himself wondering if
he could exchange bis ticket in St. I^ouis*.
"Traveling with her father and mother,
I suppose?"
"No, suh; they's huh uncle and aunt. I
heah huh call 'em uncle an' aunt. Th'
ole gent'man is Uncle Caspar. I don'
know what they talk 'bout. It's mostly
some foh'en language. Th' young lady
allus sneaks Amehican to me, but th* old
folks cain't talk it ver' well. They all
been to Frisco, an' th' hired he'p they's
got with 'em say they been to Mexico,
too. Th' young lady's got good Amehican
dollahs, don* care wha' she's been". She
allus smiles when she ask me to do any
thin', and I wouldn' care if Bhe nevah
tipped me, 's long as she smiles that
away."
"Servants v.-ith them, you say?"
"Yas, suh; man an' woman, nex' sec
tion t'other side the ole folks. Cain't say
mor'n fifteen words in Amehican. Th'
woman Is huh maid, an' th' man he's th*
gen'ral hustler fer th' hull pahty."
"And you don't know her name?"
"No, suh, an' I cain't ver' well fin' out."
"In what part of Europe does she live?"
"Australia, I think, suh."
"You mean Austria."
"Do I? 'Scuse ma ig'nance. I was jis'
guessin' at It anyhow; one place's as good
as 'nother ovah thuh, I reckon."
"Have you orie of those dollars she gave
you?"
"Yes, suh. Heh's a coin that ain' Ameh
ican, but she says it's wuth seventy cents
in our money. It's a foh'en piece. She
tell me to keep it till I went ovah to huh
country: then I could have a -high time
with itâ that's what she says â 'a high
time'â an' smiled kin' o' knpwin' like."
"Let me see that coin," said Lorry, eag
erly taking the silver piece from the por
ter's hand. "I never saw one like it be
fore. Greek, It looks to me; but I can't
make a thing out of these letters. She
gave it to you?"
"Yas, suhâ las' evening'. A high time
on seventy cents! That's reedlculous,
ain't it?" demanded the porter scornfully.
"I'll give you a dollar for It. You can
have a higher time on that."
The odd little coin changed owners Im
mediately, and the new possessor dropped
it into his pocket with the inward con
viction that he was the silliest fool in
existence. After the porter's departure
he took the coin from his pocket, and.
She Became Interested in the f earch and Bent
Over to5can the Dark Coroers With Eager Eyes.
There was a theory in his family that
it would have been a decenter thing for
him to stop running about and settle
down to work. But his thoughtful father
had given him a wealthy mother,- and as
t-arninp a living was not a necessity, he
failed to see why it was a uuty. "Work
is becoming to seme men." he ence de
clared, "like whiskers or red ties, but It
does not follow that all men can stand it."
after that the family found him "hope
less, " and the argument dropped.
He was just under 30 years, as good
lookine as rooet men. with no one de
pendent upon him and an income that had
Withstood both the Maison Doree and a
dahabeah on tho Kile. He never tired of
Feeing things and peoples and places.
â¢"There's gaire to be found anywhere," he
said, "only it's sometimes out of season.
If 1 had my wayâ and millionsâ I should
run a newspaper. Then all the excite
ments would come to me. As it is â I'm
poor, and bo I have tu go all over thÂ«
world after them."
Thic agreeable theory of life had worked
â¢well; he tras a little bored at times â not
bc-rause he had seen too much, but be
cause there were not more things left to
see. He had managed somehow to keep
his enthusiasms through everything â and
they made life worth living. -He felt. roo.
a certain elationâ like a spirited horseâ
at tnrr.ing toward home, but Washington
had not much to offer him, and the thrill
did not last. His big bag and his hatbox
â pasted over with foolish lafce's from
Continental hotelsâ were piled in the cor
ner of his compartment, and he settled
back in his seat with a pleasurable sense
of expectancy. The presence in the next
room of a very smart appearing young
woman was prominent in his conscious
ness. It gave him an uneasiness which
was the beginning of delight. He had
eec-n her for only a second in the passage
way, but that second had made him hold
himself a little straighter. "Why is it,"
he v.ondered. "that some girls make you
ttar.d like a footman the moment you see
them?" Grenfall had been in love too
many times to think of marriage; hla
habit of mind was still general, and he
classified women broadly. At the same
time he had a feeling that in this case
generalities did not apply well; there was
something about the girl that made him
hesitate at labeling her "Class A or B or,
Z." What it v.as he did not know, butâ
unaccountablyâ she filled him with an af
fected formality. He felt like bowing to
her with a grand air and much dignity.
And yet he realized thai his successes had
come from confidence.
At luncheon he saw her In the dining
car. Her companions were elderly per
sonsâpresumably her parents. They
lalked mostly in French-occasionally
using a German word or phrase. The old
gentleman was stately and austereâ with
an air of deference to the young woman
â¢which Grenfall did not understand. His
appearance was very striking: his face
pale and heavily lined; moustache and
Imperial gray; the eyebrows large and
bushy, and tho jaw and chin square and
firm. The white-haired lady carded her
head high with unmistakable gentility.
They were all dressed In traveling suits
which suggested something foreign, but
not Vienna nor Paris; smart, but far from.
American tastes.
Lorry watched the trio with great In
terest. Twice during luncheon the young
\u25a0woman glanced, toward him carelessly
and left an annoying impression that she
had not seen him. As they left the table
and passed into the observation car, he
stared at her with %me defiance. But
she was smiling, and her dimples showed,
and Grenfall was ashamed. For some
moments he eat gazing from the car win
dowâforgetting his luncheonâ dreaming.
When he got back to his compartment
he rang vigorously for the porter. A
coin was carelessly displayed in his
fingers. "Do you 6uppose you could find
out who has the next compartment,
porter?"
"I don't know their name, suh, but
they's goln' to New York jis as fas' as
they can git thuh. I aln* ax um no ques
tions. 'cauPe thuh's somethir;' 'bout um
makes me feel's if I aln' got no right to
look at um even."
The porter thought a moment.
"I don' believe it'll do yuh any good,
suh. to try to shine up to tha' young lady.
She a in' the sawt. I can tell yuh that I
done see too many guhls In ma time "
"What are you talking about? I'm not
trying to shine up to her. I only want to
know who she isâ just out of curiosity."
Crenfall's face was a. trifle red.
"Beg pahdon, suh; but I kind o' thought
you was like oth' genfmen when they
see a ha'n'some woman. Allus wants to
fin* out somethin' 'bout huh, suh, yoh
know. 'Scuse me foh misjedgln' yuh* suh.
Th 1 lady In question is a foh'nerâ she
lives across th* ocean, 's fuh as I can fin'
out. They's In a hurry to git home foh
some reason, 'cause they ain' goln' to stop
this side o* New York, 'cept to change
cans."
"Where do they change cars?"
"Â£t. Louisâ go'.n' by way of Cincinnati
eu' Washta'toa."
As it happened, Mr. Grenfall Lorry did
not have a dull moment after the train
started. He stumbled on a figure that
leaned toward the window in the dark
passageway. With reluctant civility he
apologized; a lady stood up to let him
pass, ar.d for an instant In the half light
their eyÂ«?<= met. and that is why the miles
rushed by with incredible speed.
Mr. Lorry had been dawdling away the
months in Mexico and California. For
years he had felt, together with many
other people, that a tea voyage was the
essential beginning of every Journey; he
had started round the world soon after
leaving Cambridge: he had fished through
Norway and hunted in India, and shot
everything from grouse on the Scottish
moors to the rapids above Assouan. He
had rim in and out of countless towns
and countries on the coast of South Amer
ica: he had done Russia and the Rhone
Valley and Brittany and Damascus; he
had seen them allâ but not until then did
it occur to him that there might be some
thing of Interest nearer home. True, he
had thought of joining some Englishmen
on a hunting tour in the Rockies, but that
had fallen through. When the idea of
Mexico did occur to him he gave orders
to pack his things, purchased Intermin
able green tickets, dined unusually well
at his club, and was off in no time to the
unknown West.
MR. GRENFALL LORRY boarded
the east -bound express at D<?n
li )k> \ VPr wltil n11 tlle alr of a martyr.
He hv.i traveled pretty much all
over the world, and he was not with
out resources, but the prospect of a twen
ty-fivo hundred mile Journey alone tilled
him with dismay. The country he knew;
the scenery had long since lost its at
iractions for him; countless newsboys had
failod lo t.'mpt hiin with the literature
they thrust in his face, and as for his
fellow passengers -well, he preferred to
lÂ»e al^ne. And so it was that he gloomily
motioned the porter to his boxes and
mounted the steps with weariness.
With this he turned and ran rapidly
toward the little depot and telegraph
office.
"We cannot catch the flyer.. I want
to catch It as much as you and"â here he
straightened himselfâ "I would add a
thousand to yours." He hesitated a mo
mentâthinking. "There is but one way
and no time to lose."
Down one of these streets walked the
young lady, curiously interested in all
about her. She seemed glad to escape
from the train and Its people and she
hurried along, the fresh spring wind
blowing her hah- from beneath her cap.
the ends of her long coat fluttering
Lorry stood on the platform watching
her;, then he lighted a cigarette and fol
lowed. He had a vague feeling that she
ought not to be alone with all the work
men. She started to come back before
he reached her, however, and he turned
again toward the station. Then he heard
a sudden whistle and a minute later from
the end of the street he saw the train
pulling out. Lorry had rather distin
guished himself In college as a runner
and instinctively he dashed up the street
reaching the tracks just in time to catch
the railing of the last coach. But there
he stopped and stood with thumping
heart while the coaches slid smoothly up
the track, leaving him behind. He re
membered he was not the only one left
and ho panted and smiled. It occurred
to himâ when It was too lateâ that he
might have got on tho train and pulled
the rope or called the conductor, but that
was out of the question now. After all,
it might not be such a merry game to
stay in that filthy little town- it did not
follow that she would prove Triendly.
A few moments later she appearedâ
wholly unconscious of what had hap
pened. \ A glance down the track and
her face was the picture of despair.
Then she saw him coming toward her
with long strides, flushed and excited.
Regardless of appearances, conditions or
consequences, she hurried to meet him.
"Where Is the train?" she gasped, as
the distance between them grew short
her blue eyes seeking his beseechingly'
her hands clasped.
"It has gone."
"Gone? And weâ we are left?"
He nodded, delighted by the word "we "
"The conductor said thirty minutes: it
has been but twenty." she cried half
tearfully, half angrily, looking at her
watch. "Oh, what shall I do?" she went
on, distractedly. He had enjoyed the
sweet, despairing tones, but this last wail
called for manly and instant action.
"Can we catch the train? We must! I
will give a thousand dollars. I must catch
It." She had placed her gloved hand
against a telegraph polo to steady her
trembling, but her face was resolute, im
perious, commanding. She wa3 ordering
him to obey as she would have com
manded a slave. In her voice there was
authority, in her eye there was fear. She
could control the one but not the other.
Off the main street of the town ran llttJa
lanes leading to the mines below. They
all ended at the edge of a steep declivity.
There was a drop of almost four hundred
feet straight Into the valley below. Aloru?
the sides of this valley were the entrances
to the mines. Above, on the ledge, waa
the machinery for lifting the ore to tho
high ground on which stood the town nnd
railroad yards.
"How long are we to be delayed?" she
asked. Just two minutes before Ihi3
same conductor had responded most un
graciously to a simple question Lorry hari
asked and had gone so far as to Instruct
another inquisitive traveler to go to a
warmer climate because he persisted in
asking for information which could not be
given except by a clairvoyant. But now
he answered in most affable tones:
"We'll be here for thirty minutes, at
least, Missâ perhaps longer."
She walked away, after thanking him.
and Grenfall looked at his watch.
Lorry strolled up to tne crowd of pas
sengers who were watching the engineer
and fireman at work. A clear, musical
voice, almost in his ear. startled him. for
he knew to whom it belonged. She ad
dressed the conductor, who, impatient
and annoyed, stood immediately behind
him.
Lorry realized that his opportunities
were fast and that he dii
not seem to be any nearer meeting her
than when they started. He had hoped to
get Uncle .Caspar Into a conversation and
use him. but Uncle Caspar was as distant
as an Iceberg. "If there should be a
\u25a0vreck." Grenfall caught himself thinking,
"then my chance would come; but I don't
see how Providence is going to help me
in any other way."
Near the close of the day. after thpy
left St. Louis, the train began to wind
through the foothills of the Alleghenies.
Bellalre. Grafton and other towns were
left behind, and they were soon whirling
up the steep mountain, higher an-1
higher, through tunnel arter tunnel, near
er and nearer to Washington every min
ute. As they were pulling out of a lltt!o
mining town built on the mountain sirie
a sudden jar stopped the train. There was
some little excitement and a scramble for
Information. Some % part of the engine was
disabled, and it would be necessary to re
place it before the "run" could proceed.
Before the train reached St. Louis he
made up his- ailnd to change cars there
and go to "Washington with her. It also
occurred to him that he might go on to
New York If the epell lasted. During the
day he telegraphed ahead fcr accommo
dations, and when the flyer arrived In St.
Louis that evening he hurriedly attended
to the transferring and rechecking of his
baggage, bought a new ticket and dined.
At 8 he was at the station, and at 8:15
he passed her in the ai3le. She was stand-
Ing In her stateroom door, directing her
maid. He saw a look of surprise flit across
her face as he passed. He slept soundly
that night and dreamed that he was
crossing the ocean with her.
At breakfast he saw her. but if she saw
him It was when he was not looking at
her. Once he r aught Uncle Caspar star
ing at him through his monocle, which
dropped instantly from his eye in tba
manner that Is always self-explanatory.
She had evidently called the uncle's atten
tion to him, but was herself looking se
dately from the window when Lorry un
fortunately spoiled the scrutiny. His spir
its took a furious bound with the realiza
tion that she had deigned to honor him by
recognition. if only to call attention to
him because he possessed a certain coin.
Once 'the old gentleman asked him the
time of cay and set his watch according
to the reply. In Ohio the man servant
scowled at him because he Involuntarily
etared after his. mistress as she paced the
platform while the train waited at a sta
tion. Again, in Ohio, they met in the ves
tibule, and he was compelled to step aside
to allow her to pass. He did not feel par
ticularly jubilant over this meeting. She
did not even glance at him.
THE SUNDAY CALL.

TWO STRANGERS IN A COACH.
Lorry* wasted very little time. HÂ«

"Isn't it strange that this particular
coin should have reminded you of home?"
"You have no right to question me, sir,"
she said coldly, drawing away, only to be
lurched back again. In spite of herself
she laughed 1 audibly.
"I beg your pardon," he said, , tantallz
ingly.
"When did he give it you?"
"Who?",
"The porter, sir."
"You have no right to question' me," ha
said. \.
"Oh!" she gasped. "I did not mean to
be inquisitive." .
"But I grant the right. He gave it me
inside of two hours after I first entered
the car."
"Oh, but I have seen many like it In
my purse there are several at this min
ute." . . . ..
"Especially if I had not seen one of Its
kind since leaving home," he replied, in
sinuatingly.
to go to Europe in order to follow tho
injunction of Ihe donor. . As I am more
likely to go to Europe than he I relieved
him of the necessity and bought his right
to a, 'high time. 1 "
There was a long pause, during which
she attempted to Withdraw herself from
his side, her little fingers struggling tim
idly beneath the big ones.
"Are you a collector, of coins?" she
asked at length, a perceptible coldness in
her voice.
"No. I am considered a dispenser of
coins. Still, I rather like the idea of pos
sessing this queer bit of money as a pock
et-piece. I intend to. keep it forever and
let it descend -as an heirloom to the gen
erations that follow me," he said, laugh
ingly. "Why are you so curious about
itr;
'Because it comes from the city and
country in which I live," she responded.
"If you. were in a land far away from
your own would you not be interested in
anythingâ even a coin â that reminded you
of home?" \ .
Did he remember! His heart almost
turned over with the joy of knowing that
she had really noticed and remembore-l
him. Involuntarily his glad fingers closed
down upon the gl6ved hand that lay be
neath them.
"I believe I do remember, now that you
speak of it," he said in a stifled voice.
"You were standing at a window?"
"Yes; and I saw you kissing those ladles
goodby, too. Was one of them your wife,
or were they \ all your sisters? I have
wondered."
"Theyâ they wereâ cousins," he In
formed her, confusedly, recalling an in
cident that had been forgotten. He had
kissed Mary Lyons and Edna Burra} 1 ;^ â
but their brothers were present. "A fool
ish habit, isn't it?"
. "I do not know. I have no grown cous
ins," she replied demurely. "You Ameri
cans have such funny customs, though.
Where I live no gentleman would 'think
of pressing a lady's hand until it pained
her. Is it necessary?" In the question
there was a quiet dignity, half submerged
,in scorn, so pointed, so unmistakable that
he flushed, turned cold with mortification,
and hastily removed the amorous fingers.
"I crave your pardon. It is such a
strain to hold myself and you against the
rolling of this wagon that I unconscious
ly gripped your hand harder than I knew.
Youâ you will not misunderstand my mo
tive?" he begged, fearful lest he had of
fended her by .his ! ruthlessness.
: "I could not misunders.tand something
that does not exist," she. said, simply,
proudly., ;
"By Jove, she's beyond comparison!" he
thought. ,
"You have explained, and I am sorry I
spoke as I did. I shall not again forget
how- much I owe ypu.". . ... ..
"Your indebtedness, U Uiere be one.
, "At Denver?"
"How do you know I got on at Den
ver?"
"Why, you passed me in the aisle with
your luggage. Don't you remember?"
He detected a tone of security in her
voice.
"But he will stop! Your uncle will see
to that, even If tho operator fails."
"My uncle will kill him if he does not
stop or come back for me," she said,
complacently!
"I was not wrong," thought Grenfall;
"ho looks like a duelist. Who the devil
are they, anyhow?" Then aloud: "At
this rate we'd be able to beat the train
to Washington in a straight-away race.
Isn't it a delightfully wild ride?"
"I have acquired a great deal of knowl
edge in America, but this is the first
time I have heard your definition of de
light. I agree that it is wild."
For some moments there was silence in
tho noisy conveyance. Outside, the cack
of the driver's whip, his hoarse cries, and
the nerve-destroying crash of the wheels
produced impressions of a mighty storm
rather than of peace and pleasure.
"I am curious to know where you ob
tained the coin you lost In the car yes
terday," she said at last, as if relieving
her mind of a question that had been
long subdued.
"The one you so kindly found for me?"
he asked, procrastlnatingly.
"Yes. They are certainly rare in this
country."
"I never saw a coin like it until after
I had seen you," he confessed. He felt
her arm press his a little tighter, and
there was a quick movement of her head
which told him, dark as it was, that she
was trying to see his face and that her
blue eyes were wide with something
more than' terror.
"I do not understand," she exclaimed.
"I obtained. the coin from a sleeping-car
porter, who said some one gave it to him
and told him to have a 'high time* with
It," he explained In her ear.
"Ho evidently did not care for the 'high
time,' " she said, after a moment. He
would have given a fortune for one
glimpse at her face at that instant.- \u25a0 '.
"I think he said it would be necessary
Unable to resist, he released the strap
to which he had clung so grimly, and
placed his strong, firm hand encourag
ingly over the little one that gripped his
arm with the clutch of death. It was
very dark and very lonely, too!
"Oh!" she cried, as his hand clasped
hers. "You must hold to the strap."
"It Is broken!" he lied, gladly. "There
is no danger. See! My hand does not
tremble, does it? Be calm! It cannot
be much farther."
"Will it not be dreadful if the con
ductor refuses to stop?" she cried, her
hand resting calmly beneath its protector.
"Perfectly. He is no other than Light
horse Jerry, the king of stage drivers."
In the darkness he smiled to himself ma
liciously.
"Oh, then we need feel no alarm," she
said, reassured, not knowing that Jerry
existed only in the yellow-backed novel
her informant had read when a boy. â¢
There was such a roaring and clattering
that conversation became cfnost impos
sible. When either spoke it was with
the mouth close to the ear of the other.
At such times Grenfall could feel her
breath on his cheek. Her sweet voice
went tingling to his toes with every word
she uttered. He was in a daze, out of
which sung the mad wish that he might
clasp her in his arms, kiss her, and then
go tumbling down the mountain. She
trembled in the next fierce lurches, but
gave forth no complaint. He knew that
she was in terror but too brave to mur
mur.
and they might go rolling to the bottom
of the ravine, hundreds of feet below.
Still, he must not let her see hia appre
hension. "This fellow is considered the
best driver in the mountains," he pre
varicated. Just then he remembered hav
ing detected liquor on the man's breath
as he closed the door behind him. Per
haps he w-as Intoxicated!
"Do you know him?" questioned the
clear voice, her lips close to his ear, her
warm body pressing against his.
\u25a0 "Pray be calm. I was to blame, for I
had become careless. He is earning his
money, that's all. It was not stipulated
in the, contract that he was- to consider
the comfort of his passengers." Grenfall
"I believe I thought as much at the
time. Oh, confound this road!" For a
half-mile or more the road had been fair
ly level, but, a3 the ejaculation indicates,
a rough place had been reached. He was
flung back in the corner violently, his
head coming in contact with' a sharp pro
jection of some kind. The pain was al
most unbearable, >ut it was eased by the
fact that she had involuntarily thrown
her arm across his chest, her hand
grasping his shoulder spasmodically.
"Oh, we shall be killed!" she half
shrieked. "Can you not stop him? This
is madnessâ madness!"
"Since you presume to believe the mir
ror instead of me, I will tell you. There
was a dispatch on the first page that in
terested me deeply."
"With a poor old mirror? For shame!
Yet, in the name of our American glass
industry, I ask your forgiveness. It shall
not happen again. You â¢will iSlmit that
you were trying to read over my shoulder.
Thanks for that immutable nod. Well, I
am curious to know what you were so
eager to read."

"How did you know that?" she inconsist

"Now, that is unfair."
"So it is. Did you read the dispatch
from Constantinople?" Her arm fell to
her side suddenly as if she had just real

"The one that told of the French Em
bassador's visit to the Sultan?"
"Concerning the small matter of a loan
cf some millionsâ yes. Well, that was of
interest to me inasmuch as the loan, if
mado, will affect my country."
"Will you tell me what country you are

"I am from Graustark."
â¢'Yes; but I don't remember where that
Is."
"Is it possible that your American

"I confess ignorance," he admitted.
"Then 1 shall insist that you study a

"Frcm the tenor of your remarks I
judge that you have been away from
home for a long time," he volunteered.
"We have seen something of Asia, Aus
tralia, Mexico and the United States since
we left Edelweiss, six months ago. Now
we are going home â home!" She uttered
the word so lovingly, so longingly, so ten
derly, that he envied the homeland.
There was a long break in the conver
sation, both evidently wrapped in thought
which could not be disturbed by the whirl
of the coach. He was wondering how he
could give her up, now that she had been,
tossed into his keeping so strangely. She
was asking herself over and over again
how so thrilling an adventure would end.
They were sore and fatigued with the
strain on nerve and flesh. It was an ex
perience never to be forgotten, this ro
mantic race over the wild mountain road,
the result still in doubt. Ten minutes ago
âstrangers; nowâ friends at least, neither
knowing the other. She was admiring him
for hir, generalship, his wonderful energy;
he was blessing the fate that had coma
to his rescue when hope was almost dead.
He cf.uld scarcely realize that he was
awake. Could it be anything but a vivid
fancy from which he was to awaken and
find himself alone in his berth, the buzz-
Ing, clacking car wheels piercing his ears
with sounds so unlike these that had been
whispered into them by a voice, sweet and
maddening, from out the darkness of a
dreamland cab?
"Surely we must be almost at the end
of this awful ride," she moajied, yielding
completely to the long suppressed alarm.
"Every bone in my body aches. What
shall we do if they have not held the
train?"
"Send for an undertaker," he replied
grimly, seeing policy in jest. They were
now ascending an incline, bumping over
boulders, hurtling through treacherous
ruts and water-washed holes, rolling,
swinging, jerking, crashing. "You have*
been brave all along; den't give up now.
It is almost over. You'll soon be with
your friends."
"How can I thank you?" she cried, grip
ping his arm once more. Again his hand
dropped upon hers and closed gently.
"I wish that I could do a thousand times
as much for you," he said thrillingly, her
disheveled hair touching his face so close
were his lips. "Ah, the lights of the
town!" he cried an instant later. "Look!"
He held her so that she could peer
through the rattling glass window. Clode
at hand, higher up the steep, many lights
were twinkling against the blackness
Almost before they realized how near
they were to the lights the horses began
to slacken their speed, a moment later
coming to a standstill. The awful ride
was over.
"The train! the train!" she cried in
ecstacy. "Here, on the other side.
Thank heaven!"
He could not speak for the joyful pride
that distended his heart almost to burst
ing. The coach door flew open and Light
Horse Jerry yelled:
"Here y're! I made her!"
"I should say ycu did!" exclaimed Gren
fall, climbing out and drawing her after
him gently. "Here's your ten."
"I must send you something, too, my
good fellow," cried the lady. "What la
your addressâ quick?"
"William Perkins, Oâ -, West Virginny
ma'am."
Lorry was dragging her toward the car3
as the driver completed the sentence.
Several persons were running down the
platform, dimly lighted from the string
cf car windows. She found time to pant
as they sped along:
"He was not Light Horse Jerry, at all!"
Illâ MISS GUGGEXSLOCKER
He laughed, looking down into her se'i
ous upturned face. A brief smile of' un
derstanding flitted across her lips as she
broke away from him and threw herself
into the arms of tall, excited Uncle Cas
par. The conductor, several trainmen
and a few eager passengers came up, tha
former crusty and snappish.
"Well, get aboard!" he growled. "We
can't wait all n'ght."
The young lady looked up quickly, her
sensitive face cringing beneath the rough
command. Lorry stepped instantly to the
conductor's side, shook his finger vigor
ously under his nose and exclaimed in
; no uncertain tones:
"Now, that's enough from you! If I
hear another word out of you I'll make

"Aw, who are you?" demanded the con

"How far is it?"'
"Four miles."
"Telegraph ahead and hold the train

"The train don't stop there."

GrcnCall'e manner was commanding. The
Bgent'l impression was that he was Im
portantâthat he had a right to give or
ders. But he hesitated.
"There's no way for you but to get to
P â anyway," he said, while turning the
matter over in his mind.
"You stop that train! I'll pet there in
side of twenty minutes. Now be quiok!
Wire them to hold herâ or there'll be an
order from headquarters fcr some nine'y

then turned to his instrument, and thei
message went forward. Lorry rushed out.
On the platform he nearly ran over the
hurrying figure in the tan coat.
"Pardon me. I'll explain things in a
minute." he grasped, and dashed away.
Her troubled eyes blinked with astonish
ment.
At the end of the platform stood a moun
tain coach, along: the sides of which was
printed In yellow letters. "Happy
Srrinp-p." The driver va? climbing up to
nis se?t and the cumbersome trap wad
empty.
"Want to make ten dollars?" cried
Grenfall.
"What say?" demanded the driver, half
falling to the ground.
"Get me to P inside of twenty min

up! Answer!"
"Yes. but you see. I'm hired to "
"Oh. that's all right! You'll never make

Pnck to ine station he tore. She was
f-t.Trding: near Use door, looking up the
track miserably. Already night was fall
ing. Men were lighting the switch lan
terns and the morntains were turning
into great black shadows.
"Come quickly: I have a wagon ctit
here."
Resist'epsly she was hurried nlong and
ffirly shoved through the open door of
tbe odd-locking erarh. He was beside her
or the seat in an instant, and her bewil
dered ears her.rd him say:
"Drive Slice the very deuce!" Then the
door slammed.' the driver clattered up to
his seat and the horses were off with a
rush.
"After that train. I'll tell you all about
It wbon I get my breath. This Is to be
the quickest escape from a dilemma on
! record â providing it is an escape." By
th's time they were bumping along the
flinty road at a lively rate, jolting about
on the seat In a most disconcerting man
ner. After a few long, deep breaths he
told her how the ride in the Springs luieK
had been conceived and of the arrange
ment he had made with the dispatcher.
Tie furthermore ncquwinted her with the
cause of his being left when he might
have caught the train.
"Just as T reached the track, out of

"How can I ever repay you?'' she mur
mured. "It was so good and thoughtful
of you. ' Oh, I shculd have died had I

know. That could easily happen," tri
umphantly.
"Can this man get us to the next sta

the black mountains and the dense foli
age. It was now quite dark.
"If he doesn't bump us to death before
we get half way there. He's driving like
the wind."
"You must let me pay half his bill," she
eaid. decidedly, from the dark corner in
which ehe was huddling.
HÂ© could find no response to this per
emptory requegt.
"The road is growing' rougher. If you
â¢will allow rne to make a suggestion, I
think you will see Us wisdom. You can
escape a great deal of ugly Jostling if
you will take hold of my arm and cling
to It tightly. I will brace myself with
this strap. I am sure it will eave j'ou
many hard bumps."
Without a word she moved to his side
and wound her strong little arm about I1I3
big one.
"I had thought of that." she said sim
ply. "Thank you." Then after a moment,
while his heart thumped madly: "Had It
occurred to you that after you ran so
hard you might have climbed aboard the
train and ordered the conductor to stop it
for me?"
"Iâ I never thought of that!" he cried,
confusedly.
"Please do not think me ungrateful.
You have been very good to me, a
stranger. One often thinks afterward of
things one might have done, don't you
know? You did the noblest w T hen you

this so prettily that he came gayly from

ness, bordering on criticism, had thrown
him. lie knew perfectly well that she
was questioning his Judgment and pres

cf it the more transparent became the
absurdity of his action.
"It has been no trouble," he flound

THE SUNDAY CALL.
THE STORY OF LOVE BEHIND
THE THRONE.
7Millions of dollars hove been given by
Morgan to charity, but the- work In which
he takes the most interest is that of Dr.
Rainsford In St. George's parish. New
Tork. Here they have all kinds of costly
experiments in progress for the ameliora
tion of the condition of tho submerged
tenth. There Is a coal yard where coal is
bought by the ship load in summer, when
it Is cheap, and sold out by tho tin buck
etful in tho winter time at the same price.
There is also a parish store where are
gathered the good as new cast-off clothes
of tho wealthy parishioners, to be sold at
nominal prices to the poor who have
many shivering children to cover. A
school of domestic economy 13 conducted
free of charge, where women may go and
learn to make one dollar do the work of
four by judicious expenditure and careful
handling of the purchases. A boys* train
ing school and boys* clubs are on a larger
scale than usual, and to these Mr. Mor
gan pays the compliment of giving his
personal attention, even making short ad
dresses to the boys. Cottages by the sea
on Long Island have also been built and
are rented at small cost to cover repairs
to those poor of the parish who need the
sea air to enable them to recover from
illnesses that succumb to the atmosphera
of the tenements. There is no limit to the
amount that he is willing to expend In
charity so that it is the kind that he!p3,
but he is wary of the kind of giving
which only tends to make the recipients
more dependent. So broad are all of the
many works of Morgan that it Is confus
ing to attempt to even classify them. A
story of his life would be the history ot
America to-day.
WHERE HOSPITALITY WILL BE
- AT ITS VERY BEST:
THIS has been California's lucky year
In things both large and small. Cali
fornia hospitality is famous, and as
though she has not enough reputa
tion the richest man in America and
the best cook in America have come out
here to help sustain It. When Mr. Mor
gan determined to keep open house for
the notable delegates to the convention
he very thoughtfully took away with him
the caterer best beloved of all New York's
four hundred and brought himâ the inimi
table Louis Sherryâ out here to delight
the palates of our notable guests.
It took something more than money to
make Louis Sherry leave his eight-story
rotisserle, with Its cellar full of wines and
the roof garden which crowns Its glory,
and' hike out here to California. But the
gustatory honor of the country "was at
stake. It is well known that clergymen
have delicate appetites and Bishops, by
one degree more of advancement, have
still more refined palates. , There were
Lord Bishops coming from England and
Bishops from Asia, . Africa and South
America. Furthermore, the American
delegates are something themselves.
When the convention was at Washington
three years ago Washington said that it
was the brainiest convention which had
ever met there, and Washington knows
brains when it sees them. Now every
body knows that preparing brain food is
a delicate matter, 'and for the glory . of
the convention, of California, of the
church and the ' whole country ' Louis
Sherry left the four hundred to whet their
appetites, while he came out here to cook
for tho one hundred.
Mr. Morgan has always been an ardent
worker for the church in his quiet way
and has attended every convention for
the last fifteen years or more, always tak
ing a large house and doing his best to
make the wanderers gathered from
abroad feel themselves at.home under his
roof. .It la at rreat \u25a0aerifies of his own
interests, without doubt, and sometimes
the high pressure under which he works
even breaks- in on .the midst of, his trip.
An Instance of ; this is given by one who
was at his dinner table one day while in
Washington, at the last Triennial Con
clave. A servant came in and laid
a letter -. on the table by his / plate
before he had finished his soup. Mr.
Morgan read the letter, whispered to an
attendant to whom He had beckoned and,
excusing himself, .shortly afterward left
the table. It transpired that he had upon
reading the letter ordered his private car
to be telephoned for, a carriage ordered
and before his guests rose from the table
he was speeding away over the Pennsyl
vania line, going to Wall street as fast
as steam could_ carry him. While Mr.
Morgan alone dispenses his hospitality
out here all California* reaps the advan
tage of It, for those people from far-away
States and countries^ who have the for
tune to be his guests, will always carry
inseparably connected In their memories
the luxurious Interior of the Crocker
home, the incomparable catering of Sher
ry, the genial manners 'of Mr. Morgan
and the sunny skies and balmy airs of
the city by the Golden Gate.
only thing remaining for him, which was
to accept the offer.
He is above all things a quick judge of
human nature, and It Is by his study of
men more than facts that he makes up
his mind for action. This is shown by
the difference In the reception accorded to
a. young broker who had undertaken to
finance a rather daring scheme for a -cli
ent and came to Mr. Morgan with some
trepidatlwi to submit what was really a
good list of securities upon which his cli
ent wished to secure his loan. Morgan
was, as usual, easily accessible. He
looked at the broker with those eyes
which seemed to the young man, in his
own words, "to be burning clear through
him." Then, after scanning the list, Mor
gan said, "I'll take the loan," and the
young borrower was passed on to one of
the junior partners of the house. In two
minutes' time, and with the use of only
five words, Morgan had done more busi
ness than many a village bank does in a
whole year.
Mr. Morean evidently believes, with the
Indian school of philosophers, that the
use of words Is a waste of strength and
that vital energy is conserved by silence.
It Is his usual habit in accepting invita
tions to public dinners to stipulate in ad
vance of his acceptance of the Invitation
that there shall be no speechmaklng. In
his officeT^'en during the most Important
mendous profit for himself from the ne
cessities of the case. It surprised him
much when Morgan suddenly appeared
before him and said, "I'll give you $
for your property," and subsiding into
silence left the mine owner to do the.
centratlon the most eloquent gabblers and
supposedly irresistible oratorical water
spouts shed their words in vain, and come
away dumber and wiser men, leaving the
field of victory to Morgan.
, Not only Is he silent, but immovable. If
other men want to see him it is their
move. He runs to the beck and call of
none. Even when our great and glorious
Uncle Sam needs some gilding done In the
Treasury Department it Is the Secretary
of the Treasury who climbs the steps of
J. P. Morgan & Co., at the corner of Wall
and Broad streets, and not Mr. Morgan
who rushes to Washington.
All the good old axioms go to smash be
fore Morgan's way of doing things. He
does not look before he leaps, but leaps
before he looks half-over a thing, coming
to conclusions before explanations ars
finished and giving Judgment Immediately
by saying "I'll do this" or "I will not do
that." As his words are few it Is easier
for him to keep them, and It is to this
that the keenest men about him ascribe
his wonderful success in Inspiring con
fidence Jn those with whom he deals. The
nice old sayings about taking advice are
also carefully disregarded by Mr. Morgan,
who once, when a very young man, said
In answer to a friend who was trying to
restrain his impetuous business methods
and get him to seek counsel, "I find that
successful men keep their own counsels,
and only thoa-j who have made failures
are willing to give away advice."- His
own advice is good enough for him, and
by his system of non-communicative deal-
Ings he succeeds in keeping the best part
of it for himself. By acting independent
ly he saves much time, and has surprised
other financiers more by the rapidity with
which he makes financial combinations
than by the size of them. The entire
work of planning and perfecting the com
bination of the United States steel indus
tries occupied but three months. Morgan
was already the head of some branches
of the business, and happening to be at a
dinner where Mr. Schwab was descanting
dlscuBsiona, he usually observes the same
silence that he has shown during the con
vention here, but, like the Irishman's owl,
he keeps up a devil of a thinking. Op
posed to this fortress of silent mental con-
1K the good old colony times, when we
lived under the King, the ancestors
of J. P. Morgan were then, even la
those early days, stout pillars of the
church in the commonwealth of
Massachusetts.
They treated with the Indians, helped
in'lhe drafting of the State's constitution
and later on fousht in *the war of the
Involution. For the whole two hundred
end fifty rears that the family has been

Miles Morgan was one uf the founders
of the town of Sprinsfield, and Joseph
llorfran. grandtatber of N John Pierpont
Horsan, \u25a0was a trcll-to-do innkeeper of
Hartford. Cor.r... In the Oays when the
keeper of tho inn was the principal gen

Til;cn there wore only a few barrelsful of
pino tree shillings in New England and
Spanish douM.-ons hud to fill the gaps left
by the scarcity of English coins.
JunrJE Spencer Morgan, the father of
the present master of finances, was him
eelf a banker of hisrliest ability. He had
a natural inclination for work of the
cer.ntfns house and uas a bank clerk
whci only a boy. Me inherited from his
father Joseph .ill of the earnings of the
profitable tavern commenced life well
oft for those times. He was associated
for a time with Lcvi I\ Morton in the dry
goods trade and later becamo interested
in bt'.s:r.?.-:s ventures jointly with George
Foabody, the first notable millionaire
philanthropist.
Junius S. Morgan's success was owing
to his daring in starting: his London bank
ing house, which prospered his affairs to
such an extent that he w Â»s able to leave
nearly ten million dollars to his son, John
Plerpcnt Morgan.
The mother of J. P. Morgan was de
scended Irom a stock which was as strong
and influential in a patriotic, poetic and
literary way as the Morgans were in the
financial. She was a daughter of Rev.
John Pierpont of Boston, a man whose
strong mind was devoted to reforms for
the good of the human race.
J. P. Morgan was born on the 17th of
April, 1S37. near Hartford, Conn., on a
farm which has since been incorporated
with the town, as the latter has grown
out and around it. Morgan as a boy was
sturdy and solid, studying not so hard as
to distinguish himself and ruin his con
stitution; neither was he talkative nor
Inclined to the social side of school life.
His pleasures seem to have been mainly
those of outdoor sports, hunting, fishing
and boating. His education was finished
by two years* study at the University of
Gottingen, Germany. From there he re
turned to take a place in the foreign ex
change department of the American
brar.ch of his father's bank, and it was
In that broad school that he got his grasp
on the method of handling International
finances.
The latter part of Mr. Morgan's life has
been devoted to a realization of the
dreams of his two grandfathers: for one
the achievement of vast wealth: for the
other, the reformer John Pierpont. He
is putting an end to destructive compe
tition by uniting rival and combative
forces and increasing the possibilities for
useful creativeness. The scale on which
he is uniting already surprising aggre
gations cf capital is something unknown
in the world before and has been called
"Morganizing"' by the Xew York brokers,
vrho had nc name for such tremendous
t'nior.s cf capital as Mr. Morgan has ef
fected. It is a direct step toward nation
alization, yet accomplished by a process
which appeared to have been always
tending in a reverse direction.
"The bogie of Wall street," where
troubles dim and big are continually
frighting timid capital, is J. P. Morgan,
"the old man," as he is generally called
by those who do not care to have his
name too often on their tongue. If he
\u25a0were the old man of the sea he could not
Inspire more terror among many of the
"operators" who make an exploiter's
living by wiggling values up and down a
point or so to clip margins off specu
lators' investments. He has little sym
pathy with stock .jobbers of this class,
and has given them such hard squeezes
that even he himself felt sorry, and
rather than send the whole card house of
speculative investment tumbling by ex
acting his pound of flesh he has permit
led liiem to "Â£>ab?" and c~t tbelr losses
to figures which they could stand.
This will be remembered as. having ofi'
curred only recently In London, when
thÂ« fight over Northern Pacific nearly
caused the ruin of dozens who got caught
between the shears that Morgan wields.
Mr. Morgan has from the beginning of
his business life always followed his own
advice and been sole dictator of all of
the affairs In which he has taken part,
for he believes In no divided authority,
and even the banking house of J. P.
Morgan & Co. Is a partnership and not
a corporation. It Is to this freedom of
action that he owes much of his power,
for it enables him to Instantly take ad
vantage of turns of the wheel of fortune
without waiting for the action of a cum
bersome board of directors.
In the matter of the use of words he
chows extreme parsimony. He has
learned well the lesson that words are
the most expensive things any person
can uso, even 'if they do flow freely. In
business he Is fond of limiting his con
versations to the conventional length of
the ten-wcrd telegram, or as much less
as he can condense his statement.
When once the short statement is made.
It Is his last. There Is no appeal and no
time lost in making one. The advantage
which this method of doing business
gives him can be Imagined from the fol
lowing story.
The owner of a Pennsylvania coal mine
found that his mine was the key to a
situation which Morgan must hold. Mor
gan did not go to the miner. That Is not
his way. Finally the miner came to Mor
gan, who allowed him to have a good,
long wait in the anteroom to work him

New York financiers are usually lumped
together in a single class, with no differ
ence between them but their relative
wealths, in the minds of those who are
not familiar with their ways. As a fact,
no two of them are in the same line of
business. Sage was a money lender pure
and simple; Keene a speculator who
watched for the turn of the market as a
gambler does the turn of a card. Goulti
was a wrecker who profited by the mis
fortunes which he often helped to bring
about. The Vandsfisilts and Astors are
strictly confined to their specialties oC

of competition, by paying the bills of
those who are swamped with debt and
reaping hl3 profit from increased produc

railroads of the South offered an Inviting

nearly everything on wheels that is pulled
by steam. The methods of the Southern

make head or tail out of the confusion.
When his plan was formulated It required
twenty-six foreclosure suits to vanish the
ghostly equities of the chancery courts
and expenditure of enough money to can
cel two hundred and fifty millions of In
debtedness. The Southern Railway, whlca
was the name of the company evolved by
this feat of "Morganization," was not at
first popular with investors, who were loth
to see how the combination of a number of
failures could make a success. It was in
1S33 that Mr. Morgan began his recon
struction of the Southern reads. To-day
the combination of them makes one of
the best paying systems of the country

Morgan's upbuilding, helpful policy
should be remembered by those who crit

Government were running down Its credit
and running up the price of gold In a vain
attempt to wreck the Union the Morgana,
on the contrary, were the first to offer
gold for the resumption of specie pay
ments in 1S7G, when the country had been
for years in a precarious financial condi
tion, with its paper promises always be
low par. Again in 1S35 and 1S96 Morgan
came to the aid of the country and if he
did charge a high price it was no more
than was necessary to enable him to

The greatest feat which Morgan has
accomplished in the financial world â ona
that appeals to every proud American â
was his turning the tables on tho money

he secured twelve million dollars by the

8Many Alameda and South End oarsmen
were out last Sunday. The South Ends
had a race between a crew consisting of
Charles Jenkins, Ed Pallas, J. Pallas and
M. Cashman in the racing barge, anil a

Iron Works and back to the clubhouse
was a close one, the Felton crew winning
by one length, though on the previous
Sunday the McGeorge erew in the racing
barge, conceding one minute, had been
beaten. It is likely that eome South EM
oarBmen will attend the Dolphin enter
tainment to-day. If the South Ends can
get the loan of the Ariel racing bar^e
they may send two crews over to the A\i

There will be a quarter-mile handicap
Bwlmming race, and for the entertain
ment of the fair visitors several comic
events have been provided, such as kyack
races, walking the greasy pole and an
old-clothes race, in which the swimmers
must wear coat, vest, trousers, hat and
shoes, and must return to the slide with
everything on, the distance being fifty
yards out and back.
The Olympic Club Is desirous to secure
a long lease of suitable ground in East
Oakland near Sessions Basin or in Ala
meda near the Alameda Boat Club quar
ters, but so far has not toeen able to get
what it wants. It is said that some of
the members of the Olympic Boat Club
would rather retain the Belvedere house,
but the advantages of that location are
small as compared with those of quarters
on Oakland Creek. Oakland or Alameda
can be reached every half-hour during the
day, and a large number of associate
members could be obtained from those
towns who do not care to Incur the ex
pense of joining the Post-street club, che
dues of which are high for many young
men. It is certain an accessible boathouse
and smooth water to row upon would
greatly Increase the interest in boating
among the Olympics, who have plenty of
excellent material for oarsmen. It ie
almost equally sure that rowing will
never acquire much hold of the Olympic
members as long as the inadequate, in
accessible quarters at Belvedere are re
tained. It is hardly possible to train a
racing crew in Tiburon Cove, cumbered as
it Is with arks and yachts, and the upper
bay is not suitable for rowing on sum
mer afternoons.

lucky in getting hard coursing in these

the big event at present. Aeolus has had
more than his share of hard running and
it is doubtful If his owner considers him
a good chance. Cold Shivers, looked upon
as the strongest of the youngsters with
high ambitions, is out of the game, at
least for this stake.
It is expected the nomination of Beacon,
runner-up In the last John Grace cup. will
be offered. Beacon has been In training

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct.
32. -(Improvement in the football
teams, particularly the, fresh
man, has been quite marked this week.
While the weather has been j decidedly
warm for hard work, the men seem to get
into the- game with much more snap than
they did last week. Undoubtedly the Im
proved condition and spirit of the men is
due in a large measure to the strict train
ing rules enforced since Monday and to
the , fact _that they have been eating at
the' training table under the supervision
of Trainer "Dad"* Moulton during the
week. I After the game with' Reliance Sat
urday tho coaches decided that something
must be done to put more life into the
players. As a result an order was issued
Monday that candidates for the football
teams must refrain from attending dances
and other social functions during the foot
ball season.
TENNIS REGAINS ALL ITS OLD-TIME POPULARITY.
SERKELEY. Oct. 12.â The im
provement during the past week
of the individual and team play
ing on the University of California eleven
has- been decidedly marked. The men
have increased in ability in a satisfactory
way, although there is of course still
much to accomplish before the big game,
less than a month away.
In the Olympic gamo of last Saturday
the Californians several times failed to
concentrate their efforts at critical mo
ments. ' After playing in splendid style
until the goal line was within their reach,
they would go to pieces and fail to score.
This la^k of united effort was noticeable
throughout the game. Recent practice is
eliminating this.
Gendotti now has Freshman Morehead
as an opposing candidate for center, Tho
new man is heavier than Gendotti but is
less certain in passing the ball. He is,
however, developing into a promising
rival for the older man. Overall, at right
guard, is playing a steady, reliable gamo,
When opposed to Cadwalader In the
Olympic struggle he was able to play even
with that veteran in spite of tho club
man's superior weight. His punting Is
strong and reliable.
More and Hudson are trying out for
quarter and are making an even race for
it. Hudson is playing remarkably well,
Womble Is back at his old position at,
right end and plays with his* usual sure-
ness and dash. Mini, at left half, is doing
remarkable work and is one of the sur
est men for gains on the team.
He is suffering from a badly bruised
thigh which is hindering his practice con
siderably.
The freshman eleven is an erratic body
and has been playing some bad ball. Can
didates for positions are numerous and
among them are some good men.
The executive committee of the student
body has reported favorably on an East
ern trip for the track, team. Graduate
Manager Decoto has been instructed to
look carefully into tho. financial side of
the matter and- if necessary funds can
be secured the team wjll go. An early de
cision is wanted, as the men wish to make
dates as soon as possible for meets next
spring with Yale, Harvard, Princeton,
Cornell and possibly Chicago. The mon
would like also to take part in the Mott

On Saturday, the 5th inst.. the San

During the evening there was an In

there is almost continuous shooting there
the birds are timid.. A dog moving about,
a bunch of decoys or a clumsily arranged
shooting stand at once attracts their at

range of a shotgun. They spend the days
on the bay, where they are inaccessible,
and go in to feed at night.

and refurnish their shooting lodges in an

Indoor work has opened a field for all
girls, for most of the games demand that
the pocket-book be opened, the wider the
better. And the timid get a chance, too.
They can taka sojid comfort in doir.sr a
hand-spring or a back flip in a secluded
corner. Then again class work is not as
expensive,, but there is a certain amount
of sociability connected with it.
That the girls have trespassed Is true
in a measure. Tennis was the fir3t game
of an athletic character which found any
favor. That jwas about thirty years ago.

and so, too, do men. It is as easy for a
man to fall and break a couple of ribs
as it Is for h!a sister, but the old-fash
ioned people never set this Idea into their
heads. The one old idea remains firm
that women are usurping man's amuse
ments and that no good can possibly
come from it.
I?f a shop on Atlantic avenue there Is
building a torpedo-shaped metallic
boat, about sixteen feet long, with a
depth of five feet and egg shaoe in
cross section. The cockpit seats four
people. Their heads come about a foot
below' the highest point of the boat.
Boats of this style are designed for use
In a r/cw scheme for summer and beach
resort to b<:Â« known as "Dip the Dip."
The "Din tho Dip" Is a submarine div
ing boat, running on overhead rails. Tne
scheme is to shoot these sixteen-foot me
tallic boats, containing four passengers
<ach. dov.n an incline similar in shape,
ces:gn and angle to the "Shoot the
Chutes." exrr^Ungr that it makes a com
rl^t'S circuit, bf ins an endless track. At
the bottom of the incline is a tank of
water, about twelve feet (*efp, eight feet
wide and seventy-five feet long.
As the heavy metallic torpedo boat
ccmc? down the Incline it plumfes into the
tank nf water for a distance of thirty feet
and is totally submersed to about four
feet at its greatest depth. The boat's
Impetus is sufficient to carry it through
the v.ater and up an Incline back to the
normal level, which is several feet higher
than the t-urface of the water in the tank.
The passengers are seated In a cockpit,
cntireiy ope a t t he top and sWes, and
yÂ¥i t not a drey cf water -comes within a
or eighteen Inches or the passengers.
The reason of this, so the inventor. L. A.
Carpenter of Meachmont, claims, Is that
Mr. Carpenter haa been allowed a patent
on the "Dip the Dip" and Is now building
at Crescent Beach tho first full-sized
structure.â Boston Post,
the speed of the pointed boat throws the
water aside, or to use Mr. Carpenter'a
own words, "the speed -of thÂ« boat as
It enters the water ia about fifty feet a
second, or thirty miles an hour, which en
ables the boat to travel Us own length
in one-quarter of a second. This takes
them through that part of the tank in
Which they are totally submerged, a dis
tance of thirty feet, in loss than one-half
a second. The opening In the boat being
but five feet, gives the water but ono
twelfth of a second In which to faM on the
passengers, but as the force of gravity Is
not sufficient to draw any object further
than one-quarter inch the first one
twelfth of a second the water does not get
time to get into or touch any part of the
boat, particularly the opening where the
four passengers sit.
"Ttke boat Is so heavy and sharp pointed
and comes into the water at such a rate
of speed that Its sharp nose literally bores
or tunnels a passage for Itself through the
water, which does not have time to fall
back or cave in until the boat has passed
through. The boat, after coming out of
the* water, travels along and up an incline
of a height of six or eight feet by its own
momentum. This acts as a brake and
slows the boat up so that it glides around
the curve and comes to a standstill at the
starting point, ready to be connected to
an endless cable and drawn up the incline
for a fresh start."

away scamper the lithe, b'.ue-bloimered
students.
Miss Palmer joes not go In for' what sha
calls "circus feats." She thinks they are
rather risky, and she 5s quite positive that
the results are not nearly as satisfactory
as the pulleys, chest weights, the club.?

Posto-graph, that Is. half poster and hair
photograph, a photograph with the poster
effect In design and colors.
I was looking at some posters one day
when the Idea of poster-photograph came
to me. ; I said to myself, "Why couldn't
a poster effect be made that would re
tain the likeness of the individual?"
In the postograph we take the likeness
directly from a photograph. The rest Is
done by the artist.
I think the photographer, more than
anybody else, feels the demand for nov
elty. Every once in a -while he must
come out witli something entirely new.
He must surprise and Interest the public
or else move his photograph gallery to a
back street. * j .

limited field".
Great and wondrous have been the
strides of photography In thÂ« last tea
years, but these strides have been from
a mechanical standpoint purely.
A new finish or a new mounting wSX
produce an entirely new effect.
For this the photographer has relied on
the manufacturing: firms. They send thÂ«ir
paper men around with the latest novel
ties. They send their demonstrators, who
show the photographer the wonderful ef
fects given by the platinum and the> soft
carbons. And close upon the heel* of thÂ«
paper man comes the mount man with ar
tistic mounts to match the new papÂ«r.
So far everything has been dona to help
the photographer with his work and
nothing has been left to htm but the
posing.
In the postograph I think we have
something new from an artistio stand
point.
The photograph Is enlarged and printed
upon any paper that will take- water col

It is difficult work and he who would
be a postographer must have the yerJua
of a real artist.
The whole Idea must be in keeping with
the subject. The accessories must b* m

you to sign it, and as two, witnesses are
required he asked Captain Loeffler, a
doorkeeper, who sat in the reception hall,
to come in and witness it also.
He said to Loeffler: "Captain, this Is my

signed his name and retired.

BERLIN, Oct. 12.â According to reports
received here from Sofia the captors of
Miss Stone demand that the ransom shall
be deposited at Samakov. A Bulgarian
cattle drover, v.ho was an eyewitness of
the kidnaping, has been arrested on sus
picion of complicity in the outrage at the
instance of the United States Consul.
SOFIA, Oct. 12.â An official communica
tion, which has just been issued here, in
dignantly protetts against the assertion
that the Bulgarian Government has been
conspiring with the Macedonian commit
tee in regard to the abduction of Miss
Ellen M. Stone, the American missionary.
The note points out that while nothing is
positively known of the composition of,
the brigand 'jand, it was undoubtedly,
formed in Turkey. Miss Stone was' cap
tured near Mchomia, a short distance
from a Turkish post, and her captors
were seen October 9 in the hills between
the Turkish villages of Eleschnitza and
Jakorunda, all these facts tending to .
show that she has never left Turkish ter
ritory. ,
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 12.â The situ
ation in the case of Miss Stone to-night
is that Missionaries Baird and Haskell
are still trying to get into touch with the
brigands in order to agree on the amount
of ransom. It is scarcely likely that this
agreement will be reached for some days.
As soon as word comes from the mis
sionaries that the amount of the ransom
has been determined upon a member of
the United States legation will start for
the place named with the money.
Since the brigands who abducted Miss
Stone were located on the mountain of
Gultepe, the approach of the troops in
duced them to change their retreat. They
are now hiding on the Turko-Bulgarian
frontier, ready to cross to either side, as
circumstances demand. The decision to
suspend the movements of the troops was
partially due to the difficulties of operat
ing in the mountainous country and part
ly owing to fear that a further advance
might endanger the life of Miss Stone,
hence the American desire to try to
negotiate for the payment of a ransom.
It is hoped this will result in the release
of Miss Stone in a few days.
Bulgaria U"ot Implicated.
Negotiating With Bandits.
The State Department is extremely anx
ious that the entire amount of Miss
Stone's ransom shall be raised as rapidly
as possible. It is evident that the efforts
to secure a reduction in the amount of
ransom have failed and that before they
will release their captive the brigands
will insist upon the payment of the entire
5110,000 demanded.
The American agents will continue nego
tiations with the brigands through the
channel of communication already estab
lished in the hope of securing additional
time within which the ransom can be paid.
CALL. BUREAt", 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.â Miss Ellen
M- Stone is apparently no nearer liberty
to-day than she has been since captured
by brigands in Bulgaria. A serious men
ace to her life has been removed by the
compliance of Turkey and Bulgaria with
the request of the United States not to
authorize their troops to attack the band
should its new place of refuge be dis
covered. There remains danger that a de
tachment, coming- suddenly upon the
brigands, may attack and that the latter
will murder their prisoner. This is a con
tingency which both Consul Eddy in Con
stantinople and Consul Dickinson in Sofia
are trying to guard against.

Papers Consummating the
Transfer Are Now Being

BALTIMORE. Md., Oct. 12. -It la
positively stated here that alX
negotiations looking to the pur
chase of the Market-street Rail
way Company of San Francisco were
practically closed to-day and that
as soon as the necessary papers can be
drawn up the road will pass into posses
sion of the syndicate headed by G. R.
Webb, J. T. Blackwell and R. G. Hanford.
Ever since negotiations were com
menced between the syndicate and I. W.
Htllman. H- E. Huntington and the rep
resentativts of the Crocker estate the lat
ter have insisted that all shareholders
should be treated en an equal basis. It
was known that a two-thirds interest as
represented by the larger stockholders
could be purchased at par. This would
have, left the 300 smaller stockholders
without the customary financial safe
guards. But the insistence that the syn
dicate should take all of the stock at the
one ba^Js, said to be the par value, caused
a delay in negotiations.
At last, after many exchanges of letters
and telegrams, it was determined to-day
to accept the inevitable and pay the prlct>
demanded. S1G0 a share. This will Involve
a transfer of about $iS,GOO,O0O of Baltimore
capital to San Francisco. But It is not
probable that the syndicate will stop
at the Market rtviet system. It has al
ready secured the San FAncisco and San
Mateo electric line. It is also said that
negotiations are pending for the purchasa
of the Sutter street line and Sutro rail
road, a portion of the same line.
In order to secure a controlling interest
in these lines and effect a consolidation
of the Market street, San Mateo, Sutter
and Sutro lines a two-thirds vote of thÂ»
stockholders would be needed. The heav
iest deal has been made, and all that re
mains now is the drawing of the neces
sary legal papers. It is expected that this
will be consummated within the next
thirty days.
The plan adopted by the local stockhold
ers of the Market-street Railway Com
pany is the same/ as that followed when
the transfer of the San Joaquin Valley
road was made to the Santa Fe system.
All the stock was pooled and sold at par.

PORT TCAVNSEND, Oct. 12.â According
to advices received here to-day by the
steamer John S. Kimball, Nome was vis
ited by a severe storm which commenced
on the night of September 26 and con
tinued for three - days, with increasing
fury. As a result every lighter that was
anchored off Nome is ashore and the Gov
ernment tug Captain Warden is on the
bt-ach. "While the storm was almost as
severe as the memorable storm of last
year, the most serious damage will result
from the delay -in getting the lighters
afloat so they can be used in discharging
the large number of steamers due at
Nome. Some fears are now entertained
that cargoes cannot be discharged in time
for vessels to get out before navigation
closes.
The only loss of life as" a result of the
storm thus fur reported occurred after It
war, abating. The schooner Abbie Deer
ing sailed in and Captain George Stevens
of the schooner Prosper, which was
wrecked at Cape Lisburne on August 26,
and Tracy Robertson of Seattle attempteO
to go ashore in a ship's boat. The boat
capsized and both men were drowned.
Reports brought .down by the steamer
John S. Kimball state that a reign of
terror prevails in Nome. Holdups and
robberies are of nightly occurrence. Men
are being sandbagged and robbed in
broad daylight when caught in -lonely
places. Sluice-box robberies are frequent
and several mines have been robbed of
from $500 to |2000. Business houses huvo
been entered, and even women walking"
on the streets are mafie victims. On Sep
tember 29 two masked men entered the
store of Mrs: S. M. Hovey and at the
point of'a pistol forced her to give up
1500. \u25a0 ' \u25a0 - - â¢
The Discovery claim* on Anvil Creek has
again distinguished itself. On September
14 $1552 in nuggets was picked up and on i
the 29th it yielded others weighing $1720.
The Kimball brought down 330 passen
gers and $300,000 in 1 treasure.
SEATTLE, Oct. 12.â Tracy Robertson,
who, with Captain George Stevens of the
steamer Prosper, was drowned at Nome
during the storm on September 28, was
tecretary of the Seattle' Chamber of Com
merce. The men attempted to land on .he
i beach through the raging surf. Their boat
was upset and both sank, almost Immedi
ately. The bodies were recovered the next
day. People on shore heard the men cry
for help wTien.the small boat capsized,
but no assistance could reach them in
tlmato be of avail.
Tracy Robertson," beetdeu being a prom
inent society man In Seattle, was manager
'of the Oceanic Packing Company. Cup
tain George Stevena was In command of
the Bteamshln Prosper when that vessel
waa wrecked on the northern const. He
was coming home from the Ill-fated expe
dition and owned valuable mining prop

REDDING. Oct. 12.â The Mammoth
mine, one of the best known copper prop
erties of Shasta County, has been sold
by the bonders, John Fillius and F. G.
King, to the Boston Exploration Company
of Boston for a sum approximating $250,
000. Though the deal is in the form of a
Eix-months option, the sale is assured.
The new owners buy upon the showing of
a great body of copper ore of unknown
extent, which samples nearly 4 per cent
copper in the lowest assay. Off shoots
from the present tunnels are expected to
develop 7 per cent or higher.
The Boston Exploration Company will
put on a large force of men, and as soon
as the winter storms are oyer will com
mence the building of a smelter of such
size as is shown to be needed. It. will
be of at least 500 tons daily capacity at
the start.

I fail sometimes, but not often. My
records show that S9 out of 40 who get
those six bottles pay, and pay gladly. I
have learned that most people are honest
with a physician who cures them. That
is all I ask. " If I fail I don't expect a
penny from you.
Mine is the only way to restore vital
nerve power. Other treatments bring but
fleeting results at best. If you want to
be well, let me send you an order for the
medicine. If it cures pay $5.50. I leave
the decision to you.
I will send you a book that tells how a
lifetime of study has enabled me to
strengthen the inside nerves. Those are
the nerves that operate the stomach, kid-
neys, heart, womanly organism, etc.
Weakness of these organs means weak-
ness of those nerves. Nerve strength
alone makes any organ do Its duty.
I will send you, too. an order on your
nearest druggist for six bottles of Dr.
Shoop's Restorative. Use it for a month,
and if it succeeds pay him $5.50 for it.
If not. I will pay him myself. - \u25a0\u25a0' -
N"o matter how difficult your case; no
matter what you have tried. If my book
shows you that your trouble is nerve
weakness â and moet sickness is â I will
warrant my Restorative to cure you.
Send me no money, but simply write me
a postal if you are not well. Pay when
you get well.

November 8 and 9 have been selected as
the days of the show. The maple room
of the Palace Hotel will, as usual, be the
place. Miss Jennie Blair is chairman of
the committee of arrangements, assisted
by the Misses Buckles and Dillon and
Mrs. Tubbs. The doll committee is head
ed by Mrs. Frank D. Bates. All indica
tions point to a most unique and success
ful entertainment.
A novel departure from the plans here
tofore obtaining at the annual doll show
of the 'Doctor's Daughters will be intro
duced this year. Instead of the display
of rrodel dolls which has always been a
conspicuous figure, only salable dolls will
be Dlaced on exhibition. Of course there
will be a miniature doll house, donated
this year by Misses Lillian and Grace
Spreckels.
A vaudeville performance on the after
noons and evenings of the two days the
show will 'be open is the new feature. Al
ready society is greatly interested in the
matter and is curious to know who will
be the participants. Mrs. W. J. Somers is
chairman of the entertainment committee
and has decided to arrange the afternoon
programmes for the benefit of the younger
generation and the evening programmes
for their elders. . >
Doctor's Daughters Will Introduce a
Vaudeville Show by Society

There were no notable performances in
the field events. Neither the jumpers,
pole-vaulters nor weight men approached
the previous records.
The hammer-throw was the last event
on the programme. At this stage of the
PREPARE FOR GRANTJ
DISPLAY OF DOLLS
The mile run resulted in a grand race
between G. Weller and Coggins. Weller
led throughout and stalled off Coggins'
effort at tne finish. The remainder ot the
big field was run to a standstill.
The quarter mile was almost a dead
heat between Sheean and Boettiger. The
former caught the judges' eyes first. In
another stride his opponent .was abreast
of him.
Â» FTER withstanding for years the
J\ assaults of such sprinters . as
ZA\ Drum, Asbill. Abadie and Ligda,
Â£ the Academic Athletic League 100
.yard record of 10 3-5 seconds was
reduced yesterday at Oakland racetrack
by one-fifth of a. second. The new sprint
ing wonder is W. B. Hagans of Ukiah
High School. He is 16 years old, very tall
and thin,- and would never be picked out
as 'a sprinter or an athlete. He also es
tablished a new record in the 220-yard
dash, covering the distance in 22 3-5 sec
onds, replacing Cadogan's former record
of :23 1-5. In this he finished all out,
inches in front of Wilcox of Oakland High
School. He proved a slow starter in both
races, not getting up until the last twen
ty-five yards. This is the first year Ukiah
has won the "hundred."
The third record established during the
day was in the 220-yard hurdle. Captain
Weller of Ukiah did 26 2-5 seconds, as
against his own record of :27: 2-5. He
was not present in either of the hurdle
events, winning handily. :
When the fast time was made in the
sprints the claim was made that the track
is down grade. The matter was referred
to the superintendent of the grounds. He
said the surveyor's maps show it to he
two feet up grade from the three-quarter
mile post to the finish. This is the direc
tion in which the races were run. The
summary: ?
100-yard dashâ First heat won by Wllcox, O.
H. S.; Griffin, O. P. H. S.. second; Lang, C.
S. M. A., third. Time, :10 4-5. Second heat
won by Hasans, U. H. S.: -Nelson, B. H. S.,

proceedings Ukiah and Oakland High
schools were a tie for the championship,
each having scored ."9 points to 28 for
Berkeley High School. Ukiah won the
hammer-throw. Captain Weller taking
first place and Briggs third place. This
carried with it the championship.
THE SPRINTER FROM ' UKIAH HIGH SCHOOL WHO WAS. A STAR PERFORMER AT THE SEMI-ANNUAL FIELD
DAY OF THE ACADEMIC ATHLETIC LEAGUE HELD YESTERDAY ON THE NEW CALIFORNIA JOCKEY
CLUB TRACK, EMERYVILLE, WITH SOME INCIDENTS OF THE DAY'S SPORT. . .
BALTIMORE. Md.. Oct. 12.â Judge Mor
ris of the United Stales Circuit Court to
day handed down his decision in the Rus
sian sugar bounty cases, upholding- the
action of Collector Stone in levying an
extra duty of 70 cents a hundred pounds
on sugar imported to this countrj- from
Russia by Robert E. Dov/ns, .a commis
sion merchant of this city.
Stone's action wa? taken in accordance
with an order from the Treasury Depart
ment, dated December li. 1S9S. which lev
ied this additional duty, claiming that the
Russian Government allowed a bounty of
thai amount. The attorney for Downs,
in his argument before Judge Morris,
maintained that Russia -paid no bounty
on sugar, and that the legislation in that
country which gave rise to the action of
the Treasury Department was simpiy an
attempt to avoid the evils of overproduc
tion.
To do this it was enacted that all sugar
produced above a prescribed amount

TOPEKA. Kans., Oct. 12.â As a result of
a quarrel at a dance in Lane, a little town
in Pottawatomie County, early this morn
ing two men were burned to death, one
lies at the point of death and another is
hopelessly insane.
A dance was held there last night which
was attended by a large number of the
rougher young men of the community.
About 1 o'clock this morning a general
light started. When it was over it was
found that John Teehan had been* struck
on the head and fatally injured.
When it became known how seriously
Teehan v.as hurt the other dancers scat
tered. One of them. Eugene Cronan, a
real opiate agent, went to his office to
sleep, and was accompanied by J. Mc-
Donald. During the early hour* of the
morning the office was set on fire by some
of the other dancers and the two men
wrre burned to death.

Princess Radziwill, who was present in
court, has been a frequent visitor to
South Africa, and the case has aroused
ali the greater interest because the Prin
cess has apparently always been on
friendly terms with Rhodes and the cir
cles of which he was the leader.
LONDON, Oct. 12.â The London Times
on August 8 published the following:
"We understand that attempts have
beenÂ»made to negotiate certain promissory
notes purporting to have been indorsed
by Mr. Cecil Rhodes. We are instructed
to state that if any such instruments are
in circulation they are forgeries."
This notice was inserted by B. A.
Hawkesley, counsel for Rhodes.. Hawkes
ley informed a correspondent to-day that
he had heard early in August that some
body was trying to pass some such notes.
. "Mr. Rhodes," said Hawkesley, "never
signs notes. If he. wants to give money
away he gives a check. Mr. Louw, on
whom the note was passed, is a trades
man. The mere fact that only Â£1130 was
paid shows there was something fishy ti
the transaction."
Princess Radziwill is the Princess Cath
erine, who lived at the Carlton Hotel,
London, in luxurious style.
The money was advanced on a promis
sory note for Â£2000, drawn by the Prin
cess and purporting to have been indorsed
by Cecil .Rhodes.- The latter's lawyer
made an affidavit to the effect that he had
written to Rhodes on the subject and that
Rhodes repudiated the indorsement and
all knowledge of the affair. The court al
lowed the case as against Rhodes to stand
over until November 1, pending the arri
val of Rhodes' affidavits.
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 12.-Sensational de

Respecting his personal character there will
be different opinions expressed. Outwardly
cold, tacjturn and austere, he was a man who
made 'few -Intimate, friends,- yet those who
knew him well say that no man had a' warmer
heart or took greater interest in those he es

The death of -Christopher 'S. Batterman is
more than a personal loss. to his relatives and
friends. It is a loss to. the mining industry
of Montana. As a mining engineer' he was a
man of remarkable ability. 'He was devoted
to his profession to the exclusion of everything
else except his family. His. capacity for. work
was extraordinary. His .rnlevwas ; " never", to
waste a moment, of time. :As 'a miner he has
had no superior in Montana. \u25a0 As a witness in
mining cases requiring accurate : knowledge
perfect self-control, -.quick wit and
of detail he was without a superior in the
world of mining litigation. /Hts memory was
marvelous, which fact largely accounts for his
success in life. ' . . . . \u25a0
His funeral took place at Odd Fellows'
Cemetery in this city last Friday and was
attended by many of his former college
mates,., among them Charles Butters of
South Africa,, who delivered the-follow
ing eulogy on Mr. Batterman: - .
Mr. Batterman' first made his appear
ance In Montana as a witness in the fa
mous Bell-Speculator case, and was later
employed by F. A. Heinze, After leaving
Heinze's employ he became superintend
ent of the underground work for the Bos
ton and Montana, probably the richest
copper mine In Butte, ; which, during the
last year of Batterman's life showed. a
profit of $7,000,000. In addition to this he
was also underground manager of the
Butte and Boston and other Montana min
ing companies.
During the miners' strike in Tombstone
in 18S4 he was ordered to leave Tombstone
by the Miners" Union under pain of per
sonal violence if he disobeyed the order.
Other* mine superintendents had the no
tice served on them and left the camp
the night they received the order, but
Batterman did not. He called upon a
friend and said that if he could get three
men to stay by him he wou.d not leave.
All he wanted was a fair chance and he
would fight it out.' The: three men were
found and Chris Batterman stayed at his
post, and his bravery and personal cour
age were the admiration of the mining
camp. â¢ -
Shortly after that mining case he was
called as a witness in* the great mining
suit between the Copper Queen and Cop

Ariz., and :agrain created a favorable im

death his reputation was established as
one of the leading men among the miners
of the West.

was appointed.
CHRISTOFHEK S. BATTEKMAU.
one of the most prominent engi
neers in the. United States, died
at Butte, Mont, on October 7.
His body was brought to this city
for cremation.
Mr. Batterman was well known thrangh
out all mining sections In the United
States and was connected for the last
seven or Â«>ight years with some of the
largest copper mines In Butte, Mont.
Mr. Batterman was the only son of Gen
eral C. C. Batterman, for many years su
perintendent of the Gould & Curry and
other Comstock mines. He entered the
University of California In 1875 and grad-

mine. Tombstone, during 1SS1 and 1882. As
a witness for the Head Center Mining
Company during the celebrated case be

Mining Company in 1882 he displayed such
remarkable coolness, combined with a
knowledge both theoretical and practical
of his profession, that the attorneys for
the Contention Mining Company, and
they were the greatest in their specialty
in the, West, expressed amazement at his
conduct and ekill under their cross-ex

Mrs. Aggie Kelly, who was convicted by
a jury In Judge Lawlor's court Friday on
the charge of abducting Sophie Finegold,
a young girl, and placing her in a house
of ill fame in Eureka, appeared for sen
tence yesterday. Attorney Sweeney asked
that sentence be postponed to enable him
to prepare a bill of exceptions for an ap

Judge is to leave to-day on his vacation
the matter was continued till December

Aggie Kelly Not Sentenced.
Shortly after his arrival at the hospital
he was taken with . an acute attack .ot
heart tro'uble, but rallied. Yesterday
morning a second attack followed, which
proved fatal. The attending physicians
diagnosed his case as acute inflammation
of the muscles of the heart. Notice of his
death was immediately posted in front of
the two theaters and hundreds called to
express their regrets.
At U years of age .Mark Thall had
\u25a0 achieved a notable success in the theatri

first introduction into the show world by
joining a circus. \u25a0 "He did not remain witn

San tYancisco became, office boy at the
old Bush-street Theater. .....
It was not long before his- geniality and
ability, won him promotion and he was
soon made treasurer. ' He went on the
road as agent for Leavitt's attractions,
traveling between' here and the Missouri
River, handling some of the largest at

everywhere as the "boy agent." After
Leavitt gave up his troupes Thall went
to the Alcazar under the old management

i where lie remained five' years.
Georgie Cayvan was the next to secure i
his services, and he traveled for several
years as her advance agent. But his old
love for San Francisco caused his return,
and taking up the waning fortunes of the
Alcazar, together with P'red Belasco and
M. E. Mayer, he helped make it one of
the most popular -and best paying house;}
in the 1 ' city. Always genial, he made j
friends in all directions, and his success |

ADVKBTISEMElTTSiCATARRH CAN BE CURED.
Catharrh ie a kindred ailment of consumption,
long considered incurable; and yet there is one
remedy that will positively cure catarrh in any
of its stages. For many years this remedy was
used ey the late Dr. Stevens, a widely noled
authority on all diseases of the throat and
lungs. Having tested its wonderful curative
powers in thousands of cases, and desiring to
relieve human suffering, I will send free of
charge to all sufferers from Catarrh. Asthma,
Consumption and nervous diseases, this recipe

SAGINATV, Mich., Oct. 12.â Early to
day burglars, who had previously blown
open the safe in the office of the United
States Graphite Company here and se
cured S3J in cash and $&*> In checks, ter
rorized the inhabitants of the village of
Foster, near here.
They captured Night Watchman Jones
and bound and gagged him. Then they
took him to Harden's hardware store,
where they blew open the safe. Unable
to open the strong box, they made the
watchman conduct them to Harden's
home, expecting to compel Harden to go
to his store and open the cash drawer of
the safe. Harden was prepared for them
and opened fire. The burglars used the
captive watchman as a shield to Harden's
fire. Jones was shot in the hand, but
none of the burglars was hit. The shoot
ing- aroused the villagers and the burglars
fled.

The sale of beer at the post exchanges, re
oentUr prohibited by act of Congress, will not,
I ftar. lead to the best interests of good dis
cipline in Porto Kico; the low price of native
drinks, their injurious effects ar.d the degrad
ing influence which surround here their sale
;ili tend to the undoing, rather than the up
lifting of the enlisted man; the number of
places where these drinks are sold is greater
than in the United States, thus affording more
opportunity for drunkenness ; again, the cost of
beer and other beveragvs outside of the post
< xchange is so great as to compel the soldier to
purchase the cheaper and more injurious na
tive drinks.
In an appended report Lieutenant Col
onel James B. Buchanan, commanding the
'lihtrict of Porto Rico, says as to the can
teen:
WASHINGTON. Oct. 1*.-General John
B. Brooke, commanding the Department
of the East, in his annual report for the
last fiscal year records the fact that since
his last previous report he has visited and
inspected. With a few exceptions, all the
posts in that department. He was much
gratified at the progress made at all the
artillery posts where modern armament
has been installed. The barracks at the
infantry and cavalry posts he found in
adequate in size and he recommends an
enlargement. He renews his former rec
ommendation in regard to the possibility,
in case of war, of an attack of sea coast
defenses from the land side or the rear,
and urges that the approaches from the
directions named receive â¢ the attention
which their importance demands. .
In an appended report of the acting sig
nal officer of the department, Captain L>.
S. Lycn, it is recommended that experi
ments in wireless telegraphy be conducted
with a view to its use in such harbors as
Boston and New York.
The most important feature of the re
port is an appendix by LJeutenant Colonel
J. P. Storey, artillery corps, dealing with
ordnance and artillery. He says the most
important problem now pressing upon the
artillery is how to provide a sufficient
number of officers and men qualified t<;
operate the mining defenses of our har
bors. It is admitted that the present es
tablished strength of the coast artillery
will not furnish one relief for the modern
armament alreadv provided and that in
the event of war the deficiency must be
supplied by raw recruits or by volunteer
artillery.
If war were to occur with a superior
naval power an immediate dash, no doubt,
would be made upon one or more of our
most important posts. To oppose such an
attack we should have an instructed force
of sufficient strength io execute in less
than one week after the declaration of
war the approved project for the planting
of mines in all our harbors. To operate
the mines in the harbors of the United
States and its distant possessions will re
quire about 70 officers and about 2700 sol
oiers. At the time of the immediate
planting an addition of 5000 men as labor
ers and boat crews will be temporarily
needed.

THE EMPORIUM.the ineffaceable magic of the plays them
selves without doubt, but certainly min
istered to by the modesty of the players,
that, if they could not greatly make, yet
kept them from much marring the
dramas. Of Mr. Haworth's work much
has been said, but there were also among
the humbler players a few who did more
than just keep from spoiling things. Mis.*
Belgarde was a distinctly sympathetic
Portia, also an intelligent. thougU phy
sically unconvincing, Ophelia.
Hal de Forrest's Polor.ius was really
good, and Herschel Mayall as Bassanio
was also a pleasing figure. A small part
verv well taken was the Lancelot Gobbo
of Gilbert Gardner. H. D. Byers also did
good service in small roles. William Ber
nard, who is a genial actor and a very
bad elocutionist, played the part of
Gratiano well, but did his elocutionary
worstâ and it is very bad â as the "first
actor in "Hamlet." Mabel Heritage made
a pretty Jessica, and Charles Smiley was
successful in keeping up the ghostly dig
nity of the spirit of Hamlet's father. The
other parts in both plays were all inoffen
sively handled, and it is contended that
the performances, even in their admitted
incompleteness, have made for the better
ment of the mind and heart of the actors
and their audiences.
"The Little Minister" goes this week at
the Grand Opera-house, with Ms Mayall
as Gavin Dishart and pretty Miss Laura
Nelson Hall as Lady Babbie. She should
make a good one, too.
A remarkable feature of the Haworth
Shakespearean audiences has been the
large size of the gallery population, not
the accidental audience, but a crowd that
knew what it came for and applauded dis
creetly when it got it. It got, incidentally,
the best 10 cents' worth that has been on
the theatrical bargain counter for many
months, a principal player like Mr. Ha
worth, whose conceptions- of Shylock and
Hamlet are nobly intelligent, two casts
without absolute disaster and effective
settings for both plays. It got also two
performances that, though somewhat
shaky in outline and thin In color, were
yet sincere and reverent, and though often
inadequate were never impertinent, nor
In any sense a caricature of the author's
design. They possessed besides no small

Who shall say, for example, that the
large audiences that have greeted "Ham
let" and "The Merchant of Venice." Tiur
ing the last two weeks at the Grand
Opera-house are not incomparably better
off than they would have been had the
conipany wasted its not superabundant
genius on "Sapho," "A Brass Monkey" or
"Under Two Flags"? Or, and this counts
out the not always available inspiration
of a leading man like Joseph Haworth,
were not the Alcazar audiences that
"stood for" two weeks of "The Taming
of the Shrew," with Florence Roberts
cleverly shrewing it, indubitably the rlcn
er for it than those who spent their time
and monev at the same theater on the
pseudo-classic "Ingomar," or the rancid
moralities of "Sapho"?
â¢ * â¢
SHOULD the cheap theaters meddle
with Shakespeare?-the Grand
Opera-house with "Hamlet," "The |
Merchant of Venice," the Alcazar !
with "The Taming of the Shrew,"
or the Tivoli with "Tannhauser," "Otello,"
"Mephisto"?â or should these leave the
masterpieces of the human heart and
brain to those wiÂ»> alone can interpret i
them in all -their excellence and glory?
Does it make for the betterment of the
artistic moralities tha*t the cheap theater
shall forever confine itself to the banal,
the inane in dramatic art, because of its
inability adequately to interpret its high
er forms of expression? Shall that "lead
ing heavy" of the demagogue cast â who
indubitably, if impertinently, exists, how
everâthe workingman, be compelled to
take along with the other cheapnesses of
his career the bad music and bad play, as
well as the bad singer and bad actor?
It is easy for the dramatic purist to say
"yes," to affirm sternly that no Shake
speare at all is better than a weak, in
sufficient rendering of the great play
wright's work, and still further to insist
that no play is better than a bad play.
But the subject may not thus be lightly
dismissed. One of the inalienable rights
of humankind, based on a universal in
stinct, is the right to rational amusement,
the right to happiness in one or another
shape". So intimate and vital is this need,
so imperious its gratification, so all-im
portant its bearings, that a civilization
may justly be measured by the degree in
which it ministers to this single necessity.
It is a right recognized by all Govern
ments alike, more or less, and given ex
pression to in such forms as free art
galleries, parks/ museums, subsidized
theaters, free concerts, public libraries,
and so on, and according to the kind and
prevalence of these things, so is the de
gree of civilization in the community.
Now. and more's the pity, we have not
yet arrived in this country at the pitch
of civilization indicated by the subsidized
theater, neither the player nor the play
having yet attained the point of national
respect that is demonstrated by the sub
sidizing of the art. Until that time, that
may not be so far distant as it seems, the
perennial problem of the cheap theater
will be with us, the good play with in
different players or the bad play with
the same indifferent players, and in spite
of possible mangling, distortion even,
and- inevitable comparative unworth
.of the good play's interpretation
in poor hands, the former policy
would nevertheless seem, to be clear
gain. Half a loaf, is^ better than
no bread and a bedimmed ideal better
than no ideal; therefore is it for the ulti
mate good of his own soul and ours that
the cheap player shall sometimes- lay
awkward but reverent hands upon the
holy of holies itself, the Shakesperean
drama, and the Tivoli give us the very
good four-bit "Tannhauser" that is sub
stitute for Mr. Grau's magnificence at $7
a head. .

Mrs. Pepperyâ Well, the married man in
question is her husband.â Philadelphia
Press. .
Mrs. Pepperyâ There's something pe
culiar about that couple who just moved
in next door. She's receiving attentions
from a married man who's in love with
her.
Mr. Pepperyâ What's unusual about
that?
The assassin appears a victim of evil communications, turning a ready ear to the lessons of
ignoble discontent' with a grudge against the success of others, led to abandon the industrious
habits of his non-age, and instead of holding to a noble ambition in gratitude to the civil institu
tions of his country that laid all opportunity open to his energy, becoming an enemy of mankind
and closing his career a murderer!
On the other hand, the American boy, discontented with his lot only in that noble way that
leads to its betterment by his own exertions, not envious of others, but .desirous by his own qual
ity to equal their successes, stands as the embodiment of that wholesome independence and pat
riotism to which this republic, owes its'primacy in the world.
The hope of the nation is in boys like that, whether native born or not. Let them be re
membered by the generation that is.ahead of. them, and in the public schools and every other
agency for the training and development of manhood, let them feel that their country appreciates
them and stands by their rights. '
The manly words of this Chicago lad might be put. upon the walls of every schoolroom
and their spirit be taught with benefit to every schoolboy. His lines were cast where a weak
spirit might complain, but with a healthy American spirit he regarded whining and complaint as a
waste of time that could be given better to exertion that would, send him forward toward the high
mark of his ambition. ..Every such boy may become a captain of industry, the strength of his
country and the final cause of its glory and greatness.
Not often has the true spirit of American aspiration, energy and independence found better
expression than by this boy. It is interesting to study the different uses that are made of oppor
tunity. It is known that the assassin of President McKinley. by the time he reached twenty-one
'years of age had accumulated, of his own earnings two hundred and fifty dollars. That fact is
evidence against his. assumption that no one has any chance in this country. In what other
country can a boy do as well? Had he been content to be- industrious, thrifty, saving and
temperate, by this time he would have accumulated, from thai fine beginning, a capital that would
have made him independent, but instead of doing this, he listened to the lies ofanarchy, became
sodden in his enmity to the country and ends his career a capital felon. What a lesson there is in
the spirit and the careers of Sloan and Czolgosz!
Upon inquiry it was found that Sloan was a poor boy, working for three dollars a week,
and desirous of earning enough to get an education, and that he was a reader and thinker as
well as a worker. 'A Mr. Simmons upon learning these -facts declared that the boy should have
the education he coveted.
THE murder of President McKinley drew public attention to the anarchists, and resulted
in stirring that class to many manifestations of defiance In the present condition' of our
laws it is not easy to suppress anarchistic expressions and teachings, and the devotees of
that bloody cult took advantage of their, exemption. They had the opportunity' to show
how closely they are allied to all the preachers of pessimism and' discontent, whose, mission is
to arouse all the grudges that lurk in the heart of man. They impeach our laws, our social state
and everything that has made America the refuge of the people of the world. .
This class were very active in Chicago and furnished many, street preachers of anarchy,
who used the streets and public parks for meeting places. One Italian anarchist occupied Union
Park regularly and attracted c- large audience of the idle and vicious â¢and curious, by his ha
rangues. But he was finally put to flight by an American boy. He had made an attack upon this
country, its industrial system, its government and the features which make it distinctly American.
When he finished Eddie Sloan, an American boy, fourteen years old, stepped in front of the
crowd, and iti a clear voice said: "The hard working American boy doesn't; waste time in whin
ing and lamenting his lot, like the class that you represent. . He doesn't hate his employer, nor
does he fear the capitalist, for he aspires to become one. He knows that all the, great captains
of industry were once like him. Anyway, if your kind don't like American ways, why don't you

The following exacting programme
was rendered last Monday night by
Miss Helen Heath, a pupil of the Von
Meyerinck School of Music, on the occa
sion of her graduation from the school. I
was unable to attend, but hear on good
authority that the young lady did exceed
ingly well:
â¢ â¢ â¢
March, "Roya! Purple" (Creatore), dedicated
to Spokane Lodge of Elks No. 228; overture,
â¢Tannhauser" (Wagner); harp solo, selected,
Miss Ida Heintzen; "Traumerei" (Schumann);

soprano solo, selected. Mme. Barlll; "La. Glo

Hours."
The first concert of the Royal Italian
Band will take place to-night at the Al
hambra Theater. Great things are ex
pected of the organization this year from
the lively reports that have reached here
from time to time of its well-doing in the
East under the new conductor, Signor
Creatore. There will be twelve concerts
in all during the week, eight evening con
certs, beginning with to-night, and five
matinees, on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday afternoons.
Following is the good programme pre
pared for this evening:
â¢ â¢ â¢
To-morrow night the Tivoli will cele
brate Verdi's birthday, with a pro
gramme that will include acts from
â¢'Otello," "Trovatore," "Lombardl," "Rig
o'etto" and others. "Ernani" will be the
alternating bill with "Carvalleria" and
â¢Pagliacci."
The Tivoli has another interesting
novelty on hand this week In the shape
cf the debut of a very promising young
soprano, who will make her first appear
ance in grand opera on Wednesday night
next as Nedda in "I Pagliacci." The
singer is Miss Barnetta Mueller, a New
Orleans girl, numbering only 21 years and
n-ith a considerable experience alroady
behind her. Miss Mueller is also quite
handsome and sings for pure love of the
art, as her people are wealthy, and has
a temperament that seems to warrant the
choice. She was a pupil of Paul Stein
dorff's some , three years ago in New-
York and while there also went on -the
comic opera stage with Alice Nielsen for
a short season. Then, on the advice of
her teacher, the young student went to
Italy and has since spent a year with
Carignani in Milan, and another year in
/'"ranee with Madame Duprez-Du Wast.
Miss Mueller sang for Puccini and Mas
cagni and seems to have created a favor
able impression upon both composers.
She was also offered a debut in Italy,
l>ut refused it, preferring to make her
first essay in her own country and alto
gether Miss Mueller's is a debut that
promises more than usually well!
1HAVE had the serious misfortune
this week to fall afoul of that per
verse little person, Signor Richard A.
Lucchesi, by reason of the kinder
than wise small courtesy extended to
him in these columns last Sunday. Of
that order of intellect that can scent a
personal insult in the multiplication table,
the irate little ex-critic of the Wasp
charges me with conspiracy, intent to kill
and all the other sins in the 'decalogue, by
reason of the phrasing of the before-men
tioned notice of his intention â¢ to cease
from journalism. It should also be saiÂ«l
âI have no desire to mitigate my er
rorâthat my sins of omission in the said
notice were not less vicious than those
committed. The sad truth is that I ven
tured to regard with different eyes from
the sijmor the public importance of a pre
posterously insignificant resemblance of
a phrase in Mr. Lucchesi's quintet to a
bit from Puccini's "La Boheme" (written
four years later, look you!), keeping the
fact for my own selfish delectation. Be
ing a peaceable body, however, I make
the following retraction of the offending
statement, the handsomest in my reper
toire, in the hope that it will make for
the general amity of nations and the par
ticular peace of Signor Lucchesi:
"The pages of the Wasp are not the
poorer these days by the lively vitrlolism
of Signor Lucchesi. The vitrioltsm of
Signor Lucchesi is anything but lively.
Neither can the said vitriolism properly
be classed as vitriolism at all, but should
rather be termed mush, canicular mush."
Among announcements in connection
with the Grau grand opera season, one
that will be received with much pleasure
is that of the Wagner lectures of Walter
Damrosch, that will take place, as last
year, before the opening of the opera sea
son. Mr. Damrjseh will lecture in the
California Thea'.er, the dates later to be
announced, and his subjects this year will
embrace "Tristan and Isolde," "Der
Meistersinger" end "Parsifal," the former
two ot which we shall later have the joy
cf hearing in the Grau repertoire. Mr.
Damrosch's lectures are remembered with
much pleasure, and with their suggestive
text and ampie musical illustration are
the foest possible preparation for hearing
the operas themselves. The lectures are
under the direction of Messrs. Ellinghouse
and Oppenheimer.
The musical programme ;it St. Domi
nic's Church for this morning at 11 o'clock
will include four compositions by Alois F.
Lejealâ the "Fifth Mass." "Asperges Me

of James H. Howe, the organist and choir
master.

clever accompaniments are a feature of
any programme in which she takes part,

It is the duty of President Harriman to give attention to these things. They are not mat
ters of local concern merely. Herrin is but a subordinate in the railway office, and the issue raised
by the misuse of his official position runs direct to the president himself. It is in fact up to Mr.
Harriman to take note of what is going on here and to decide whether he is to remove the ;nis
chief-maker from office or retain him there and so antagonize the business elements of the city.
Whatever may be Mr. Harriman's decision the public have satisfaction in the fact that Her
rin's power for evil in city"politics has been already largely diminished. It was learned yesterday
that the Market-street Railway system has been transferred to a Baltimore syndicate. Mr. Herrin
has long been attorney for the Market-street company and has made use of it in his political work.
It is no longer under his control. The operatives need not now take orders from him in matters of
politics. They can vote as they please. The men into whose hands the control of the Market
street system* has passed have operated street railways in other cities, and it is known that they are
business men, devoting themselves to the work of street railway transportation. They will not
themselves use the road in politics, nor will they permit their officers to do so. Mr. Herrin. lifts
thus been shorn of that much of his former power, and it may not be long before Mr. Harriman
will see fit to further curtail it. .
As President Harriman does not live in San Francisco it is probable he is not aware of the
injury which Herrin and his gang do, not to San Francisco only, but to the railway itself. The
very, activity by which Herrin makes himself needful to the gas company, the water com
pany and other corporations makes him antagonistic to the business elements of the city. , He
makes enemies for the road among merchants, manufacturers and shippers' of every grade arid de
gree. If Mr. Harriman desires to learn how deep is the feeling of antagonism in this city to
Herrin let him note the enthusiastic reception given by the merchants to Mr. Hays when he came
to San Francisco and announced decisively that the road would be taken, out of politics. Let him
also note the silence with which the merchants received the news of Mr. Hays' retirement. There
were no meetings of congratulation among business men when that change was made. (
MUNICIPAL politicr is now in shape for the active work of campaigning. The various
parties have aligned themselves, have adopted their platforms' and nominated their can
didates. The contest- is local in its nature. It is of great importance, to the people of
San Francisco, but it ought not to be' a matter of much personal concern to other per
sons. There is, however, one man living far from San Francisco who is seriously concerned in cer
tain phases of the contest, to whom indeed the situation presents an issue that directly affects
him. That person is President Harriman of the Southern Pacific Railway, and the issue that runs
directly up to him is that raised by the use which W. F. Herrin, Jere Burke and others are making
of the railroad in city politics.
â¢ The people of Saiv Francisco have' certain questions to ask of President Harriman in this
regard. They have a right to ask whether it be his intention to carry out the policy announced
by Mr. Hays, and confine the officers of the road to railroad work, or to return' to the old way of
using the power of the road as. a political machine for the purpose of 'advancing the schemes and
personal fortunes of those officers and their favorites.
Is W.F. Herrin to be permitted to use his position in the railway office as a means: of
making himself powerful in politics and thus able to demand and obtain large fees and salaries
as counsel for local corporations who desire to do politics on occasions?"
Is he, to be permitted to drag the road into municipal politics and make it the -ally of
bosses of the worst type, using it for the purpose of electing corrupt men to office, or of corrupt
ing such as have hitherto been honest?

from the high court.
Other recent happenings have caused a
jar in the law department. It is common
gossip that Herrin is inclined to blame
Colonel Burns and Jere Burke for select
ing a questionable bunch of candidates
for the Board of Supervisors. The story
goes that Herrin and Jere Burke ex
changed unpleasant words over the affair
and that the latter broadly intimated that
he obeyed orders from some one higner
in authority than the chief of the com
pany's law office in San Francisco.
The Railroad Commissioner's long rec

A lone burglar early Thursday morning
broke into the Mechanics' clothing store
at 775 Market street and stole a suit of
clothes, some underwear and a miscellan
eous assortment of cheap jewelry. An
entrance was effected by prying open the
rear door on the Stevenson-street side
with a jimmy. The burglar, after gather
ing his booty, went into a small room in
the back of the place and discarding his
old clothes put on the suit which he had
selected from the stock. As it was one
of the most expensive suits in the place
the proprietor is inclined to believe that
the burglar knew something of the value
Ql the clothes.
â¢ A citizen who was pa&sing on Stevenson
street at the time sa>s he saw the crook
enter the place. He was poorly clad
when he entered, but when he emerged
some time afterward, - he claims, he
looked like a winner on a horse race.
The citizen describes the burglar as b^
ing about 30 years of age and with a sev
eral weeks' growth of beard. He wore a
dark slouch hat which was pulled down
over his face.
The suit of clothes which was left in
the store by the burglar has been turned
over to Captain Seymour, who is making
every effort to locate its owner.
Early Friday morning burglars entered
the New York saloon on Jackson street,
near Sar.scme, and looted the cash regis
ter of about $90.
This Is the fourth time that the salojou
has been robbed in a few months.
Chief Donahue did not accept the prop
osition, but made a counter offer to waive
the reward himself, saying nobody else
could secure it. The Chief says Crowe is
tired of being hunted and is willing to
take chances of a trial if the reward is
withdrawn, but expresses the fear that
manufactured testimony would convict
him if the reward were allowed to stand.
He says Crowe is less than 500 miles from
Omaha and is not with his relatives.
Edward A. Cudahy $r. was seen to-day
and asked if the reward for Crowe would
be withdrawn. In reply he said:
"Yes, we will do anything to secure
Crowe. This is the first I haye heard of
CrovÂ»e's proposition, but I presume it is
bona fide. 1 still believe Crowe was one
of the abductors of my son, but if he sur
renders he shall have a fair trial and if
he gives himself up under the circum
stances named the reward will be with
drawn at once. I have not heard from
Crowe directly or indirectly myself, but
Chief Donahue has had the matter in
hand and 1 will have him act in any man
ner that will secure the presence of
Crowe."
There was another Jegal fight to-day
over the case of James Cailahan, held for
perjury in the Cudahy kidnaping trial.
The plea at bar was not argued, but Cal
lahan's attorneys tiled a motion to quash
on the ground that the jury has been
called and that indictment rather than in
formation is the proper procedure. The
Judge said he would call the motion up
next Thursday and indicated that he
would overrule It. Callahan's attorneys
are said to be expecting Pat Crowe to iig
ure in the case soon and are fighting for
time.

etc., are but symptoms of some damage to the
reproductive system. In looking for the loca-
tion oÂ£ this damage we generally find an en-
larged, swollen and Inflamed prostate gland.
As this gland Is the very center of the repro-
ductive system it can readily be understood
that inflammation of it must cause disordered
function. These cases are promptly benefited
by proper treatment, otherwise the patient goes
from bad to worse. The essential point In ail
of them Is the necessity of the cure of the focus
of the trouble in the prostate. Many men have
unsuccessfully treated for a weakness and be-
come discouraged, when If an antiphlogistic
plan of treatment had been adopted instead of
tonics', a cure would have been the result. In
our experience there is no drug In the Phar-
macopeia, taken Into the stomach, that will
even benefit this class of cases. Our clan of
treatment Is entirely a local one and prompt
results are obtained, as indicated by increased
circulation and return of natural vigor. Our

Contracted Disorders.
Under the treatment pursued before Irriga-

the duration of an acute contracted disorder.
If it proceeded beyond six weeks it was con-
sidered to have rone Into chronic condition.
From statistics compiled from our practice In
the past live years, covering over 6500. cases,
we can show that 90 per cent of our patients
have recovered In fourteen days or less. It Is.
therefore, equally proper to hold that a casa
not entirely cured within two weeks must be
considered a chronic one, and some complica-
tion has arisen for which the patient should
see a specialist. "We invite free consultation

Drunkards
A Remarkable Remedy Which Clergymen,
Physicians and Temperance
Workers Now Heartily
1 Endorse.
Can Be Given Secretly in Coffee, Tea or
Food, Tbu3 Curing the Drunkard
Without His Co-op9ration;
The Remedy Is Sent Free to AIL
After many years of unceasing endeavor Dr.
J. W. Haines has finally secured the endorse-
ment of the professions for his remarkable rem-
edy. Golden Specific. This remedy is odwless
and' tasteless, 1b mixed with coffee, tea. milk or
food and given the drunkard secretly. Its effect
Is remarkable, curing cases In a short time that
seemed absolutely hopeless.
Rev. Schimpfelman, a noted German divine,
says: "I am gratified to say that I have met
many cases of drunkenness cured by Golden
Specific. The secrecy with which it can be used
i is certalrriy a great gain to the cause of tem-
perance."
MRS IRENE FLORENCE, Franklin, Warren Co., 0.
Dr. Rene Chabot. one of the greatest of
medical scientists, says: "Golden Specific is the
only cure for drunkenness. It leaves no after
effects, and I have frequently prescribed it to
be given secretly by the drunkard's wife, moth-
er or dauuhter."
Franklyn Waters, who has moved thousands
by his stirring temperance lectures, says: "No
amount of eloquence can equal 'the wonderful
accomplishments of Golden Specific. It is the
greatest temperance worker the World has ever
seen. I have known it to cure drunkards who
were always too drunk to even attend a tem-
perance lecture. Every woman should do her
best to .make Golden Specific a household
word."
Mrs. Irene Florence, box 138, Franklin, "War-
ren County, Ohio, says:
"I had for years patiently borne the disgrace,
suffering:, misery and privations due to my hus-
band's drinking habits. Hearing of your mar-
velouB remedy for the cure of drunkenness,
which I could give my husband secretly, I de-
cided to try it. I mixed it in his food and
coffee, and, as the remedy is odorless arid taste-
less, he dia not know what it was that so
quickly relieved his craving for liquor.' I soon,
found out that my mission was a complete suc-
cess and that Golden Spe*cinc had wrought al-
most a miracle for me. ! I want others to profit
by my experience and If you want you are at
liberty to refer to me as having told you about
this marvelous remedy."

Results of the .
AUTOMOBILE
ENDURANCE CONTEST
Under the Auspices of the
"Automobile Club of America" From New
York to Buffalo, September, 1901.
"We quote the following from the "Cycle
and Automobile Trade Journal" of Octo-
ber 1, 1901:
"The 'White* Steam Vehicles. â The
I White Sewing .Machine Company, Cleve-
land, Ohio, entered four of their steam
vehicles in the run, one in class A and
three In class 13. These machines made a
better combined record than that of any
other make of either steam or gasoline
vehicles. Two of them undoubtedly se-
cured first-class certificates, with an av-
erage of nearly fourteen miles per hour
for the entire run; another averaged in
the neighborhood of twelve miles per
hour, and may also secure a first-class
certificate. The two first named had the
best average .speeds next to Bishop's,
rankii.g second and third, respectively.
"At many of the controls the 'White*
wagons would follow this powerful Pan-
hard in cne, two, three, four order, and
the most excellent performance of the
machines was the talk of the run.
"The 'flash steam 1 generator used in
this vehicle has showr. itself to be highly
efficient and trustworthy. Not a single
mishap of any kind happened to the gen-
erator or engine on any of these car-
riages.
"The good work of the 'White* carriage
was especially noticeable. During the
rainy days, when the roads were m the
worst condition, they used less than a
gallon of water per mile. E\'ery one of
the four made the- complete Journey
through to Buffalo, and could have turned
around and made the trip back again to
New York over the same schedule.
"The steam generator, which is the dis-
tinctive feature of the 'White' carriage,
consists of helical coils of seamless tub-
ing, placed one above the other and sur-
rounded by a casing of insulating mate-
rial, and at the bottom the heat is applied
by means of a burner."
A. L. Clough, in the "Horseless Age"
for September 38, 1901, says:
"One point of novelty in this test was
the first public appearance in America of
the 'flash boiler.' It certainly earned for
itself the respect of all by the very cred-
itable performance which it made, which
was perhaps the most interesting feature
of the test. The future of the flash boiler
will be watched with great interest."
Hugh D. Meier, in the same paper:
"The majority of the machines in this
contest were stock machines, and most of
them were only recently out of the fac-
tory. Many of them, particularly the light
steam carriages, should never have start-
ed on this run. No matter whether these
light vehicles covered the distance in good
time or not, they were decidedly out of
place. Had they been in charge of men
not thoroughly familiar with all their de-
tails none of ihem would have reached
Albany. One Qf these light rigs received
a new engine en route. Boiler priming
was a source of trouble to most of them,
and no doubt the strong wind at times
interfered with the fire. From these trou-
bles the steam carriages with flash boil-
ers were exempt; their burners being
properly inclosed they were not affected
by wind 1 or weather." (Noteâ The
"Whites" were the carriages referred. to
as having flash boilers.)
"The schedule for the third day's run
showed that the 'Whites' started fifth,
forty-seventh, forty-ninth and fiftieth, the
last machine starting sixteen minutes
after the first. The distance was eighty-
two miles. The 'Whites' finished second,
third, fourth and fifth. The work of the
four 'White* carriages caused more talk
than anything else on the run. Their
striking snow-white finish compelled at-
tention from the very etart, and as the
run wore on they proved themselves as
good as their looks. Before the run was
half over their performance gave 'steam-
er' stock and water tube bolfers a boost
that put the gasoline vehicles on their
mettle. If they gave trouble that fact
was remarkably well concealed, and in
justice it must be saidHhat there is not
the slightest evidence of such a thing."
Dr. F. H. Bangs of San Jose made the
run from San Jose to the top of Mount
Hamilton in two hours fourteen minutes
in a "White" steam carriageâ less than
one-half the time the same trip was ever
made in. The "White" steam carriage is
as simple to operate as an electric motor,
with none of the disadvantages of exces-
sive weight and expensive power and re-
pairs. We have no water glass to watch;
impossible to burn out the steam gen-
erator; no pump or fire regulation by the
operatorâ it being only necessary to turn
on and- off the steam, steer the machine
and use your brake in operating it.
It is honestly built of the very best ma-
terials and workmanship, all v of which are
fully guaranteed. We have, we believe,
the best automobile ever offered to the
market, which has been proved time and
again in practical tests. We feel safe in
asserting that there are more repairs
necessary In one automobile of any other
make to keep it In proper working order
than on ten "Whites."
The "White" steam carriage, uses lesa
gasoline, and water than any other car-
riage, has less expense for tire mainten-
ance and other repairs, and, -on the
whole, can be operated with far less ex-
pense to the owner, as well as with far
greater satisfaction, than any other auto-
mobile ever built. Is this what you are
looking for?
If you have had unsatisfactory experi-
ence with cheap automooiles you have no
one to blame but yourself, for in automo-
biles "the best is surely the* cheapest."
Our reputation for manufacturers of
only the highest class of machinery,
which has been maintained for a half-
century, is a guarantee of perfect satis-
faction. '

yesterday's game from the sturdy Reli
ance athletes-. At the close of the con
test the score stood 6 to 0 in favor of the
students, the ball being on the clubmen's
20-yard line. The Berkeley eleven In their
team work showed solid improvement.
The interference was good, and time and
again Mini and Womble were carried
around the ends for substantial gains.
The clubmen apparently outweighed
their opponents, but the extra weight
counted for naught against the team work
of the students. 'During almost the entire
game the ball was kept In Reliance terri
tory. Several times Platt, the Reliance
fullback, was forced to punt in order to
prevent the students from scoring.
atF Â°. r -$ e Berkeley team in the first half
Mini, Womble, who played right half in
stead of right end, and Overall were re
sponsible for most of the gams. Overall's
long high punts were one of the features
of . the game. In the second half, after
the goal had been scored, Sherman and
Hamilton were substituted for Womble
and Mini, and Kelsey replaced Duden at
fullback. The addition Qf these fresh men
infused greater life into the college team
and the ball was forced toward the Re
liance goal.
STRONG interference, consistent
team work and the general good
condition of her players material
ly assisted the University of Cal-
kick. Platt punted to Hudson, who ran in
ten yards before hÂ© was downed. Mini
gained nve yards on an end run and,
Womble secured three more. At this point
there was an exchange of punts, with the
advantage on the side of California.
Mini Scores a Touchdown.
The ball was gradually carried back to
the clubmen's 15-yard line, at which point
a. determined stand was mads and tha
ball, went to Reliance on downs Platt
attempted a kick, but tha ball was
blocked by a Reliance man. The ball went
to California and Mini was sent around
end for five yards. On an off-side play
California was given tan yards, which left
the pigskin on Reliance's 15-yard line
Duden bucked center for a yard, and then
Mini, with the assistance of Hanien car
ried the ball over the line for a touch
down. Overall kicked a goal directly be
tween the posts.
For the few minutes remaining of Dlav
the California team forcedthe^cfubmeS

Baseball Meeting Postponed.
CHICAGO,. Oct.; 12.â Owing to the un
settled conditions in baseball it has been
decided to hold the annual meeting of the
American League in this city December
2 instead of next Wednesday, the date set
In the leasuo constitution.
Olympic took the kickoff and Cadwala
der eent the ball thirty yards. Fisher ran
It in ten yards but dropped it when.tack
led, and a clubman fell on it. After a
few gains through, the line Gammon went
around left end \u25a0 for seventeen yards.
Three downs netted the club athletes but
three' yards, and Stanford got the ball
but seven yards from the goal line. This
had occupied but a few minutes of play,
and It was the only time during the first
half that the Stanford goal was in dan
ger, and the conviction grew that Olym
pic had lost Its only chance to score. Hill
Gammon and Clay, the former Berke
ley players, \u25a0 carried the ball for many
yards' gain through their old enemy's
line. Each of them played like a demon,
and they, .with Embrick, the West Point
er, are to be given a large percentage of
credit for the excellent showing made by
the club team. â¢
Stanford had the best of it In punting
and in the handling of punts. -Hill, Slak
er and Fisher hit the Olympic line for re
peated gains in the' first half. Raltt
showed some - of his old-time form, and
Traeger played a great game at tackle,
both offensively and defensively. In â¢ the
second'half he stopped, single-handed, a
playjln which the weight of tackle, end,"
both half s, quarter and fullback of the
Olympics was hurled at him. > â¢
Gammon and Clay tlie Stars.
There was nothing to it but Stanford
in the first half and the collegians were
chuckling in the expectation of their team
pilling up a big score in the second half,
when condition was expected to tell. The
Olympic men had lined up but twice dur
ing the week. Cadwalader's avoirdupois
made. the. whole line' look fat and 'wise
ones who were up in the terminology of
the manufacture of lard said the Stan
ford players would make "cracklings" of
the clubmen before the end of the game.
But the unexpected happened. Those old
timers took a hitch in their belts, got to
gether and played with machine-like pre
cision, and kept Stanford on the defen
sive throughout the second half. They
tore holes in the cardinal jerseyed line
and thev ran the ends. Man after man
was taken out of the Stanford ranks and
fresh ' players substituted, but the on
slaughts of the champions of Winged-O
were irresistible. This, too, with but two
changes during the game in the Olympic
line-up, one of those, being due to a head
on collision in which Nourse,. the Olympic
left end, got the worst of it and had to be
carried from the field, limp and~semi-con
scious. This surprising difference in con
dition does not augur well for Stanford,
though the collegians say they are on the
up grade, after a slump and that a few
days or a week at most ought to put them
on edge again.
ford eleven at Sixteenth and Fol
som streets the big stars of the collec
tion pulled themselves together in the
second half and by some of the prettiest
and most fiercely aggressive play \u25a0 seen
this season tied the score and fairly won
the honors from the collegians. â¢ .
While each team secured a touchdown
and a goal, making the score a tie at 0
to ,6, the college boys held the clubmen
down to that mark with the greatest dif
ficulty and the superiority of the Olympic
team was evident.
THE Olympic Club football team
"found itself" yesterday. After
being badly outplayed in the first
half of the game with the Stan-
Cadwalader kicked off. Hill punted for
s Stanford, Olympics failed to gain, Gam
mon punted and Hill punted again on the
first line-up. Smedberg fumbled the punt,
but Parker got the ball, almost, in the
center, of. the field. Olympic ' bucked
slowly down the field, but Stanford held
on the 25-yard line. An exchange of
kicks gave Stanford the ball . again. Hill
punted and the ball rolled over the goal
line. Horan !ell on it, but he was off
side and the play was a touchback. Time
was called for the .first half.
In the second half after stubborn line
bucking and several exchanges of kicks
Olympic team work began to tell and the
club players carried the ball to the 7-yard
line. . Gammon" got two yards through
center, Clay was stopped by Dole with
but half a yard gain, and -the cardinal
line held on the third down and Stanford
got the ball on- the 5-yard line and punted
it out of danger. Kerfoot ran the punt
in 15 yards to the 25-yard line. Then

I<os Angeles "Wins at Sacramento.
. The baseball game at Recreation Park
yesterday was as listless as it is possible
for a ball game to be. After two hours
and fifteen minutes of sweltering on the
bleachers the crowd left the grounds de
jectedly to tell their friends that San
Francisco had won again, beating the
Oaklands by 10 to 7. "Youngey" Johnson
was relieved after he had twirled a few
Innings for Ewing's men with but poor
success. Schmidt succeeded him in the
box, but the Oaklands were defeated as
usual. Mohler's base running was the only
bright feature of a sultry lot of playing,
the little, fellow hitting the ball well and
stealing five bags. Nordyke injured his
ankle toward the close of the game and
_had to retire, Wilson going to second and
Graham taking his place behind the bat.
Pete Lohman received a warm foul on the
knee-cap, but he continued in the game.
The score:

H. \V. Frank estimates the loss at $30,
000, $25,000 of which is covered by insur
ance. The insurance on the building was
$10,000, and a $15,000 insurance was carried
on the stock.
Peter Hauk, the assistant foreman, dis
covered the blaze first, and grabbing a lire
t-xtin-gruisher he attempted to check the
progress of the flames. Andrew Alex
arder. another employe, and- Foreman
Westerfeld, ran to Hauk's assistance, and
the three men fought the flames until they
were almost cut off from retreat. Togeth
er they attempted to fight ytheir way down
the burning stairway, but'they could only
get as far ac the next floor. There they
made b galluni rush for the front of the
building to the fire escape. The flames
caught the fire-fighters just as they were
near the window and all three were
turned. Alexander was so badly burned
that he was taken to the Harbor Hos
pital, where his injuries were dressed.
The fire department responded quickly.
Chief Sullivan stationed the water tower
in front of :he building, which was by
this time burning on every floor. The
tower threw tons and tons of water into
the building, but the fire fought stub
bornly. Streams were thrown into the
burning structure from every accessible
quarter, but it was found necessary to
turn in another alarm. After several
houis of haru fighting- the department
finally extinguished the fire.
Fire Tjrckc out yesterday afternoon ' In
the four-story brick building at 216 Com
mercial street, owned and occupied by H.
W. Frank & Co., manufacturers of furni
ture and mattresses, and before the lire
department go; the blaze under control
the building was completely gutted and
the stock entirely destroyed. 'So rapid
was the spread of the flames that three
of. the einployes of the concern who were
in the building at the time came near be
irg burned to death. As it was, they were
br-.dly scorched about the hands and face.
The tire started in the picking-room of
the mattress making department, which
is on the fourth floor. Just how it start
ed nobody connected with the firm knows,
but Mr. Frank, the proprietor, believes it
was due to spontaneous combustion. The
picking-room was at the rear end of the
building and in it were kept large assort
ments of hair and excelsior used in the
manufacture of mattresses. This, burned
like linder, giving the blaze a good head
way.

Probably no other disease causes the human family so
much misery,* annoyance and trouble as catarrh.
Catarrh in the nasal passages is a perpetual cold in
the head.
The nasal passages are' stopped up and the membranes
are inflamed and the secretions reek with filth and nasti-
ness.
The air you breathe through the nose carries the poi-
' sonous impurities into the lungsâ when you exhale the
breath the odor is rank and offensive.
How can it be otherwise when the catarrhal inflam-
mation is rotting away the membranes and bones of the
nose and head? When the sufferer lies down on his couch
the decayed matter slips down in the throat and on to
the stomach, where it interferes with the digestive sys-
tem, causing dyspepsia and many kinds of stomach
troubles.
When the inflammation becomes chronic it is impos-
sible for Nature to overcome itâ Nature must have assist-
ance, and the best and quickest and most effective assist-
ance Nature can have is Dr. Halpruner's Wonderful
Medicine. It gives vigor, strength and force to the
blood, assisting jt carry away the impurities and drive out
the inflammation.
I If you suffer with catarrh you well know the nastiness
of itâ^vords cannot describe your annoyances and neither
can they apologize to your friends for your condition
rhere is but one thing to do, and that is to cure yourself
of catarrh by removing the cause, and Halpruner's Won-
derful Medicine is the right medicine to do this.
If you have catarrh you ought to have a bottle of Hal-
pruner s Wonderful Medicineâ give this remedy a con-
scientious trial. Because you* have tried other medicines
and they have done you no good is no reason why Hal-
pruner s, will not do you any goodâ you cannot judge
Halpruner s Medicine by other medicinesâ it is different
and hecause it is different is why it cures. . . l
Look out for the druggist who tries to talk you out
of Halpruner sâ he cares more for the money he makes on
own preparations than he does for your healthâ de-
mand Halpruner s, and if the druggist won't {rive it to you"
telephone to Bush 463 and a bottle will be delivered or
call at 28 California street.

Scrofula is the twin brother of Consumption. There is a strong resemblance : V'||\
between these diseases, and while the symptoms in Scrofula are more numerous and varied, /r^^SjL : j ! i \\ \
there is of ten-times the same gradual decline of strength and wasting away and destruction -*y \\\ VI >^^Qv
of the body that we witness in Consumption. Scrofula manifests itself in many ways, yj&w i (CrT\{
often producing gangrene of the bones and White swelling. The glands about the neck "^iry^^^^^^^""^ J}
enlarge and burst, leaving deep discharging ulcers and scars. A pallid complexion, brittle, ' >Â§?
chalky bones, soft and flabby muscles, weak eyes, chronic catarrh of the nose, violent
headaches and weak digestion are common symptoms of this terrible disease. Stunted growth, inclination to mope and lack
of interest in childish sports denote the presence of this destructive poison in the blood of the little sufferer. Again there
may be no prominent or marked symptoms, the disease hiding itself, and lying in wait for a favorable time to spring out
and destroy its unsuspecting victim, and childhood may be passed and middle life reached before the disease develops.
Scrofula is a constitutional disease and hereditary in almost every instance. It descends from father to son, from
mother to child, and on down through generations, and nothing can storj its progress until the deteriorated blood has
been restored to its normal state and all tubercular matter expelled from the circulation. SÂ» S.S. because of its absolute vege-
table purity, its freedom from all poisonous drugs, can be given with perfect safety in all stages and conditions of this disease.
Its wonderful purifying and tonic properties make it pre-eminently the remedy in scrofulous affections, as it searches out
and destroys the poisons that have been so long and so firmly embedded in the blood and system, and sends a supply of
rich nutritious blood to every part of the body; and when the weak and colorless blood is again filled with healthy red
S^ppa^^ corpuscles and regains its natural strength and hue, all symptoms disappear and a radical
ffg&asgjk /FjttivI an d permanent cure is the result. S. S. S. is a most invigorating tonic, improving tie
8 CaZr^ \ &^^ appetite and assisting in the digestion and assimilation of food. S. S. S. claims the dis-
tinction of being the only strictly vegetable blood purifier -known, and no medicine ever
tow^J I fe^/_3 1 placed upon the market has met with such unbounded success. Â»No remedy has proven
y^***ZS C^^ar so e *fc cac^ ous > so reliable and safe in all blood and skin troubles.
' g # g # s. has been for nearly fifty years, and is to-day, the most popular blood
remedy. Its friends are legion, because of the thousands of cures it has effected, and it can be truthfully said of S. S. S.
that it is as near infallible as any human remedy can be made. /'
Parents who suspect any taint of Scrofula, blood poison or other diseases that could affect their own blood should
begin at once a course of S. S. S. and stamp out every vestige of the poison, thus insuring pure blood, health and happi-
ness to their offspring. Write us about your case, and our physicians will cheerfully advise and help you in every possible
way to regain your health, for which service no charge whatever will be made. Book containing interesting information

George W. Rice, the non-union machin
ist, who was clubbed and shot Friday
evening at Twentieth, and Howard streets,
died yesterday morning at 9o.'clock at the
City and County Hospital. Four men are
in the "tanks" at the" City Prison, held on
suspicion of being, implicated in the mur
der. They are William Buckley, who was
chased and captured immediately after
the shooting and to whom the evidence
points as the man who fifed the fatal
shots; Charles Donnelly, an ex-convlct;
; Thomas Moran, a baker, of 536 Third
street, and Edward J. Duncan, a union
machinist, living at 430 Brannan street.
The murder was apparently a cold
blooded and deliberately planned assas
sination. Rice, though a non-union man,
had not taken the place of any striker,
as he had been employed at the Golden
! State and Miners' Iron Works between
three and four years. His refusal to go
out with the strikers, however, led to an
attack upon him on Fourth street August
7, and in self-defense he fired several
shots. It is thought he -wounded one or
more of his assailants and that his mur
der was the direct result of that affray.
Every featuie of the attack upon Rice
was. dastardly. His assailants rode from
First to Twentieth street upon the same
car with the non-union man. The mo
ment he alighted one of them struck him
with a white oak club, shaped like
a policeman's club and loaded with
lead. Rice was unarmed and at their
mercy, but. as he turned to attempt to
defend himself another of the gang de
liberately shot him and continued shoot
ing after his victim had fallen, nring four
snots, three. of which took effect.
Buckley Modifies Statement.
When Buckley was arrested he made a
statement which the police were convinced
was not true. Later he qualified his
statement in the presence of Detectives
Ryan and Bailey, Warrant Clerk Burke
and.. Sergeant Duke after he had been
taken to the City and County Hospital to
be identified by Rice. He said, that Fri
day afternoon he was in Maloney's sa
loon at Brennan and Zoe streets with
Duncan, Donnelly and Moran. Duncan
said something about' there going to be. a
fight out on Twentieth street and wanted
to know if they would go out and see it.
He thought it was going to be a fist fight,
and after they all left ..the saloon they,
met two men, strangers to him. At Sec
ond and Howard streets they -stopped to
wait for a car. One of the two strangers
went down Howard street toward First.
Several cars passed them till finally a car
came along and the stranger who had
joined them said, '.'This is the car." The
other stranger, who had left them, was
on the car. -Dun(5an had .gone on with a
previous car. When the car reached
Twentieth street a man got off,, and as he
was stepping off the-'car the stranger who
had-been-on the. car hit him several times
with a""blg clnb. As the man- fell from
the beating he saw. the. stranger who had
told them what car to take go up to him
and shoot several times at him.'. When
Buckley heard the shots he ran and the
man who had done the shooting ran in the
same direction. He had seen the man who
did the clubbing several times before, but
never saw the man who fired the shots
till that day.- - \u25a0
As soon as this statement was made
Ryan and Bailey went in search of. the
men referred to by Buckley. They first
arrested Moran at his lodging house, but
he denied knowing anything about, the
shooting. Further than that he would
say nothing. At the City Prison thev
confronted him with Buckley, who said
to him; "Well, Tom, they have got me
and got me right. I told them that you
were there and that you would prove I
had nothing to do with the shooting. I
depend on you for that because you know
I had nothing to do with it."
Conflicting Stories Told.
Later the detectives arrested Donnelly
as he was coming out of his house at
Brannan and Zoe streets. They asked
him if he knew anything about the shoot
ing at Twentieth and Howard streets,
and he replied he know nothing about it.
He denied being out with Buckley and
Moran. He said he had left Maloney's
saloon with them Friday afternoon, but
after leaving the saloon he left them on
Third street and went into a saloon and
got drunk. . Buckley was confronted with
him at the City Prison and begged him
as he had Moran to say that he had noth
ing to do with the shooting-. Donnelly
then said: "Yes, I did lie to you ln the
first place. I was with Buckley and Mo
ran, but Buckley was on the south side
of the car, where Rice was. When we
got to Twentieth and Howard streets and
the car stopped I heard two or three shots
fired, but I could not see who fired them."
He added that he did not know there was
going- to be a fight, that he had been
drinking and Moran had asked him to
take a ride. Moran was then brought out

The Alameda had her trial trip last
Sunday, and it was a success from every
point of view. The following Tuesday
the white firemen were discharged and a
Japanese crew put in their place. Every
thing went along as usual until Friday
afternon. when one of the Risdon Iron
Works machinists dropped His square into
one of the cylinders, the head having
been taken off that everything might be
inspected before going to sea.
ln order to recover the square the pis
ton rod had to be taken out, and then a
small flat piece of iron was discovered at
the steam port in the steam chest. Marine
Superintendent Kingrsland of the Risdon
was still in chaise of the ship, and he at
once ordered the entire engine taken
apart. Four more pieces of flat iron were
found in the steam ports, and all the oil
pipes were found charged with emery
powder.
Had the Alameda gone to sea without
these things being discovered the emery
powder would have eaten all the face otf
the brasses, the steam when under high
pressure would have driven the pieces of
flat iron into the cylinders and the piston
rod, working at lightning speed, woula
have done the rest. The bottom would
have been driven out of the cylinder, tne
steam chest would have been wrecked
and the stout mail boat would have been
heipless. As tt is, the machinery is In
t-plendid shape and a quick run to Hawaii
is cssured.

he knew Buckley, and'he said he had "met

sonably certain that he .was. . 1
Rice was 38 years old. He was unmar
ried and . lived at 3353 Twentieth street
with his mother and .hree brothers. The*
time of the inquest has not yet been set.
In this connection the statement Is also
made that the Associated Oil Company
in Its prospective membership controls
contracts for 13.000,000 barrels of oil, the
handling of which alone Is a large amount
of business to start -with. Railroad rates
always come down when there Is a cer
tainty of competition in the near future
as an alternative, and tolls for pipe line
transportation of oil undoubtedly are sub
ject to- the same rule. \u25a0 Producers in the
Kern and McKittrick districts whose
property has not yet been made a part of
the combine are generally pleased.
Some Interesting information is taken
Men prominently connected with the
Associated Oil Company have been inter
viewed In the past few days. They were
found to take a pleasing view of the situ
ation. One statement made was that the
Standard Oil Company would do the pro
ducers good if its line was operated at a
low enough rate of tolls to- make it an
object for them to use It. "If," It was
said, "the tolls are too high when the line
is constructed there is nothing to prevent
the producers from â¢ having their own
line."
There have been two matters of great
interest to engage the attention of the
oil men of the State during the past week.
One, and naturally the leading topic, was
the incorporation of the Associated Oil
Company to take in the properties of the
producing companies of the Kern and Mc-
Kittrick districts, an account of which
appeared exclusively ln The Call. The
other matter is the reduction of the rates
for hauling oil to San Francisco by the
railroads to the amount of a little over 8
cents per barrel. The latter is minimized,
although valuable for the present, by the
moves that are being made for a pipe line
trom the districts to tide water.
The Standard Oil Company some time
ago through its local representative an
nounced tnat it would construct a pipe
line. When tho articles of .incorporation
of the Associated Oil Company were made
public they contained provisions for a
pipe line building from Bakersfleld to
some point to be selected. There is not
much chance that both of these linea will
be laid. The chief Interest of the pro
ducers is naturally with the consideration
of their own welfare.

COMBINE GAINS
PUBLIC FAVOR
The men have made so many contradic
tory statements that Captain Seymour is
convinced that they were implicated in
the murder. To give strength to his con
viction Erline Piatt, a little girl, the
daughter of W. J. Piatt. 2496 Howard
street was taken to the City Prison by
her father yesterday afternoon. Buckley,
Donnelly and Moran were placed along
side of three other men, and the little girl
picked out Buckley as the man she saw
tire theifour shots at Rice. She said:
I was riding with my papa out on the How
ard street car at about 6 o'clock last nijeht.
A eirl was Blttlnjr next to me and when the
car got to Twentieth street she wanted to get
off There -was a. man st&ndlns on the step
in "front of her holding on to the Pole. She
Doked him in the back but he did not notice
her. I then saw a man clubbing another man
near the car and the man who was Doked ln
the back Jumped oft the car and fired two
shots at the man who was being beaten. The
man with the club then ran. The man fired
two more shots and then he,, too, ran. The
man who fired the shots was the .-man that I
saw in the City Prison Just now. I saw-an
other man in the City Prison who looks like
the man who did the clubbing.
Donnelly was the man v/hom the girl
identified as doing the clubbing. . J ,
. .Rice made an ante-r lortem statement to
Sergeant Duke at the City and County
Hospital, which was witnessed by. Edith
McGillivray,' Dr. William A. Reckers,
John J. Prendergast and James A. Kelly.
He said: â¢ . '
I believe I am about to die. To-nlBht I rode
out on the car on the Inside and a man who
waa.sittinE on the outside of the car KOt off
when I did and he shot me. My. best, impres
sion is that he was, a man of medium height,
about five feet seven inches and smooth shaven,
and that he had on a white hat and I thought
he wp.s dark complexioned.
1 This answers Buckley's description.
â¢When Buckley, was taken to the hospital
by -Detectives ' Ryan and Bailey, with
Warrant Clerk Burke to make a state
ment, Rice was not in a condition to
make a statement. They asked Rice if
Erline Piatt S%w Buckley Shoot.
and again confronted with Buckley and
Donnelly, but he persistently denied hav
ing been at Twentieth and Howard streets
with them..
Later Moran made a statement to Cap
tain Seymour, in which he admitted being
in Maloney's taloon with the others and
leaving it to go to Twentieth and How
ard streets. "to see a 'scab' â¢ beaten," as
he said. When the car stopped at Twen
tieth and Howard streets he and Don
nelly got off the right side of the car. He
heard shooting on the left side of the car
and ran away. "He saw another man run
ning away, but did not know who he was.
He ran because he did . not want to get
mixed up in the shooting.
Duncan was arrested yesterday after
noon and made a statement to Captain
Seymour. He lives over Maloney's sa
loon. He said he was a union machinist
but was not ov-e of the locked-out men.
He sometimes tended bar for Maloney.
and he served drinks to Donnelly, Moran
and Buckley Friday afternoon. He de
nied saying anything to any of them
about' going out "to get a 'scab .' He
left the saloon with them and' went as far
as Third and Brannan or Bryant. He did
not' get on thn Howard street car with
them. He got on a- car between Eleventh
and Twelfth streets and got out at
Twentieth street, as he wanted to find a
man named Edward Angelus, who owed
him money. He did not find him till the
shooting took place and saw him in the
crowd He was on Twentieth street when
he heart! the tihots. Then he saw several
men. running down the opposite side of
Twentieth street into Shotwell arid a mail
carrier was chasing them. He did not
know any of** he men who were running.

What Shall
We Eat
To Keep Healthy and Strong?
A healthy appetite and common sense
are excellent guides to follow in matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and meats is undoubtedly the best. In
spite of the claims made by vegetarians
and food cranks generally.
As compared with grains and vegeta-
bles, meat furnishes the most nutriment'
in a highly concentrated form and Is di-
gested and assimilated more quickly than
vegetables, or grains. . â¢
Dr. Julius Remusson on this subject
says: Nervous persons, people run down
in health and of low vitality, should eat
plenty of meat. If the digestion ls too
feeble at first it may be easily strength-
ened by the regular use of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets alter each meal. Two of
these excellent tablets taken after dinner
will digest several thousand gralna of
meat, eggs or other animal food in threo
or four hours, while the malt diastase also
contained in Stuarfs Tablets cause the
perfect digestion of starchy foods, like
potatoes, bread, etc., and no matter how
weak the stomach may be, no trouble will
be experienced if a regular practice is
made of using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
because they supply the pepsin , and
diastase so necessary to perfect digestion
and any form of indigestion and stomach
trouble except cancerÂ»of the stomach will
be overcome by their dally use. â¢
That large class of people who come un-
der the head of nervous dyspeptics should
eat. plenty of meat and insure its com-
plete digestion by the systematic use of a
safe, harmless digestive medicine likp
Stuarfs Dyspepsia Tablets, composed of
the natural digestive principles, peptones
and diastase, which actually perform tho
work of digestion and give the abused
stomach a chance to rest and to furnish
the bedy and- brain with - the necessary
nutriment.- Cheap cathartic medicines
masquerading under the name of dyspeo-
Bla cures are useless for relief or cure of
Indigestion,. because they have absolutely
no effect upon the actual digestion of
food. -
Dyspepsia in all Its forms Is simply n
failure of the stomach to digest food and
the sensible way to solve the riddle and
cure the indigestion Is to make dally use
at meal time, of a safe preparation which
is Indorsed by the medical profession and
known to contain active digestive princi-
ples, and all this, can truly be said of
Stuarfs Dyspepsia Tablets.

They were both invented .by a food ex-

food factories of the Postum Cereal Co.,
Ltd., at Battle Creek, Mich. This food
and the food drink are both made for a
definite purpose, and there are thousands
of users throughout the world that can
testify, from practical experience, that
tfce theory ls borne out by the facts. .
."Formerly I had more or less nervous
trouble and severe headaches. I am glad
to Â£ay since using Grape-Nuts and Pos-
tum food Coffee I have forgotten what a
headache feels like. .My heart ls In per-
fect condition, whereas while I was using
ordinary coffee It would not etand the
heavy strain. This statement Is absolutely
true, and I do not object to your publish-
ing it, for it may bring back health and
strength to some poor being suffering
irom ill health caused by the use of im-
proper food."
There ls a reason for this. In the first
place, ordinary coffee will show its effects
eomewhere in the nervous eyetemâ fre-
quently in weakening of the heart or in
ttomach troubles, which prevents one
from obtaining the strength and value of
food. It is. therefore, necessary to quit
the use of this drug, and ln Its place use
Postum Cereal Food Coffee and Grape-
Nuts Food. ,

ers' Benefit Fund Is Increased
by Donations.
The. machinists' strike continues to oc
cupy the attention of the metal trades
men, although the situation remains prac
tically unchanged. Both sides claim ad
vancement in their light and these claims
axe not disputed. The machinists stand
linn, but on the other hand, the iron men
are gaining new recruits from the East
almost daily. The situation therefore of
fers little hope of an early settlement of
the dispute.
During the week the working force at
the Union Iron Works was increased by
about ia*0 men. It is claimed many of these
are union men who walked out in May
last, but the greater number are East
ern men. Other iron works and foundries
claim proportional gains.
At the headquarters of the machinists
It was alleged yesterday that a check for
ti 0,000 was received Fridav from Senator
Hill, the mining man of Washington. The
statement Is made that this makes $20,000
received by the Machinists' Union from
the same individual. The further state
meat is made that Mrs. Phebe Hearst also
cent a check for 110,000 in aid of the strik
ers benefit fund. The machinists In con
sequence say they are on easy street and
that they are receiving their benefits three
times a week with comforting regularity.
Following the order directing the pay
ment of alimony Smith commenced . suit
for divorce. With the granting of the de
cree the payment of alimony ceased.
Smith's former wife forthwith asked
that the decree be set . aside and that a
new trial be ordered. She also made a
motion for alimony pending the decision
of the motion for a new trial. The motion
for a new trial was denied in the Superior
Court and an appeal was taken.
Judge Sloss decided the motion for ali
mony yesterday and held that the fact
that an appeal had been taken suspended
the decree and the husband could claim
no rights thereunder. Hence Mrs. Smith
was entttled to alimony pending the final
adjudication of the case. .
Charles H. Smith, treasurer of the
Southern Pacific Company, must pay his
former wife, Josephine Smith, alimony in
the sum of $100 a month until. the Supreme
Court passes upon the validity of the de
cree of divorce which was granted Smith
by Judge Dalngerfield several months ago.
| The payment of the alimony was or
dered by Judge Sloss yesterday. - â
The Smiths separated some time ago.
Mrs. Smith Instituted a suit for alimony,
which was decided in her favor by Judge
Hebbard, who ordered the railroad official
to pay $100 on the lath of each succeeding
month.

HE3 official records at the United
I States Weather Bureau show that
I yesterday was the hottest day of
JJL the year. Ninety-one and four
tenths degrees Fahrenheit was
what the record at the United States
Weather Bureau showed as the highest
temperature. This was at about 2 o'clock
of the afternoon. This is not a record â
not even a record for October, but It was
warm.
It was warm. It was warm when the
daylight came. It was warm when the
sun disappeared for the night. Because
of this warmth Alexander G. McAdie, the
man who watches the sun and clouds for
Uncle Sam, narrowly escaped losing a de
gree or two of his popularity. ! i
When the sun turned Friday Into a trop
ical period McAdie was consulted. He,
said: "Yes, it is hot,- very hot; it will De
hotter. But, take my . warning, do noth- :
ins in the way of discarding warm gar
ments. There will be a cold wave. The
fog will come. The temperature will drop
probably 30 degrees. Our Eastern visitors
will all be laid up with cold. Warn them,
I beseech you, of the temporary nature of
the sun's fogless and windless reign and
bid them prepare for the chill to come."
The warning was issued. The Eastern
visitors accepted the warning literally;
When McAdie said cold they understood
cold as they know it in the East and pre
pared accordingly. In spite of the sun'a
early smiles they faced the day well pre
pared to meet the cold wave half way.
The ladles carried a fur or two and all the
men were prepared with overcoats.
"When the panting, wrap burdened vis
itors returned to their hotels yesterday
afternoon they, with few exceptions,
adapted, their wearing apparel .to the tem

The Department of Agriculture is also
Interested in the subject because weather
reports from the islands would be of con
siderable assistance in making forecasts.
"What the merchants of San Francisco
have so long been demandingâ closer con
nection with the Farallone Islandsâ in or
der that' the arrival of ships may be more
promptly reported, seems now in a fair
way , to be accomplished. Congressman
Julius Kahn has given the question much
study and he proposes to bring the mat
ter up at the next session of Congress.
Several plans have been suggested. One
is the establishment of the Marconi sys
tem of wireless telegraphy/ The other is
the laying of a cable between the islands
and the mainland. Either plan would be
acceptable -toy the commercial interests of
the city. Here Is what Congressman Kahn
has to say about the matter: >
BAN FRANCISCO, October 12. 1901.
To the Editor of The Call: During' my recent
trip to the Philippines it was my good fortune
to meet Brigadier General A. "W. Greely, chief
of the Signal Corps, U. S. A. Recognizing the
importance, of having the Marconi wireless tele
graph system inaugurated between the Faral
lones and San Francisco, I called the matter to
the attention of General Greely, and the latter,
recognizing the importance of such a station
to the commerce of our city, has agreed to aid
us in having it established. This will enable
us to lt-orn of the approach of a vessel much
earlier than at the present, and in cases where
vessels are reported in distress it will allow
assistance to be sent promptly and effectively.
San Francisco has one of the finest harbors in
the world. The fact is recognized by all sea
faring men and by all persons who are inter
ested in the ocean carrying trade. â¢ And yet
every effort should be made to supplement the
work of nature by man's handiwork. I am sat
isfied that the establishment of telegraphic
communication between San Francisco and the
Farallones will be a great boon to mariners aa
well as to all persons Interested in ocean com
merce, and knowing the great interest that The
Call has taken in this matter I a:n pleased to
report that in all likelihood the work will soon
be consummated. Respectfully yours.

A NEW DEPARTURE
A New,". Effectual -and Convenient
Cure "for Catarrh.
Of catarrh remedies there Is no end,
but of catarrh cures there has always
been a great scarcity. There are many
remedies to relieve, but very few that
really cure.
\u25a0 The old practice of snuffing- salt water
through the nose would often relieve, and
the washes, douches, powders and inhal-
ers in common use are very little, If any,
better than the old fashioned salt water
douche.
The use of Inhalers and the application
of salves, washes and powders to the
nose and throat' to cure catarrh is no
more reasonable than to rub the back to
cure kidney disease. Catarrh la just as
much a blood disease as kidney trouble
cr rheumatism and It' cannot be cured
by local treatment any more than they
can be. Tv
To cure catarrh, whether in the head,
throat or stomach an Internal antiseptic
treatment is necessary to drive the catar-
rhal poison out of the blood and system,
and the new catarrh cure is designed on
this plan and the remarkable success of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is because be-
ing used Internally it drives out catarrh-
al Infection through action upon stpm-
ach, liver and bowels.
Wm, Zimmerman of St. 'Joseph relates
an experience with catarrh which is of
value to millions of catarrh sufferers
everywhere. He says: "I neglectefl a
slight nasal catarrh until It gradually ex-
tended to my throat'and bronchial tubes
and finally even my stomach and liver
became affected, but as I was able to
keep up and do a day's work I let It run
along until my hearing began to fail me
and then I, realized that I must get rid
of catarrh or lose my position, as I was
clerk and my hearing was; absolutely
necessary. . '\u25a0\u25a0'-',
: "Some of my friends . recommended an
inhaler, another a catarrh. salve, but they
were no good in my case, nor was any-
thing else until I heard of Stuart's Ca-
tarrh â¢ Tablets and bought a package at
my drug store. They benefited . me from
the start and In less than four months
I was â¢â¢ completely cured of catarrh
although I had suffered nearly all my life
from it. ;â¢;,*:. .
- "They are . pleasant to take and so
much more convenient to use than other
catarrh remedies that I - feel . I cannot
say enough in Â«favor of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets." . â¢ -'.-\u25a0 .
_A little book on cause and cure of ca-
tarrh .will be mailed free by addressing
F. A. I Stuart Co., Marshall,. Mich., and
the tablets are sold by \u25a0 all druggists in
, tbe United States and Canada. â¢

Several messages were received from
the House of Bishops at this point. The
first informed the deputies that it ha;l
voted to appoint a joint commission of
five BlEhops, five presbyters and five lay-
MESSAGES FROM BISHOPS.
Deputy Woolworth gave a lucid expla
nation of the new rule. Mr. Packard of
Maryland followed and said the rule was
one that had heen tried and never found
wanting. He said the trouble with the
existing rule was that thereunder the
house was compelled to vote blindly. He
said It was not a new experiment, but
was a rule w'/iich had been found useful
In all large parliamentary bodies. -
The motion on the amendment was then
put and was carried.
The committae further reported that It
had under consideration the two resolu
tions offered by Rev. Dr. Arnold relative
to delegates from missionary districts and
conventions in foreign lands having seats
In the general convention. He offered a
resolution asking that the committee be
discharged, as it had no province in the
matter. The request was granted.
Senator Withers of Southern Virginia
said the rule was drawn up for the ex
pediency of the house. He admitted it
was not according to parliamentary
usage. â
Deputy Bassett of Maryland in discuss
ing the report of the committee on rules
of order said that rule 13 as it at present
exists Is a wise provision and that the re
port of the committee violates it. He
suggested that as it contained a serious
defect it ought to be recast:
Deputy Woolworth of Nebraska, from
the committee on rules of order, present
ed an amendment to rule 11, with a view
to the more orderly dispatch of business.
The amendment was adopted. The com
mittee also recommended that rule 13 be
amended to read as follows: "When a
motion or proposition is under considera
tion a motion to amend and a motion to
amend that amendment shall be in or
der; and it shall also be in order to offer
an amendment, and it shall also be in or
der to offer a further amendment, by way
of substitute, to which one amendment
may be offered, but which shall not be
voted on until the original matter is per
fected, but either may be withdrawn by
the mover, witli the consent of his sec
ond, before amendment or decision is had
thereon. No proposition not germane to
the subject under consideration shall be
received under eoler of an amendment or
substitute."

The session of the House of Bishops was
also a light one. Amendments to the con
stitution were acted upon and sent to the
House of Deputies for concurrence. A
committee was appointed on provinces
and instructed to report to the next Gen
eral Convention. A board of managers of
the Boards of Missions was also appointed.
It was decided that a Bishop who had re
signed because of age or infirmities was
entitled to a seat in the House of Bishops
as an honorary member.
In the afternoon the majority of the
members of the convention accented the
Invitation of the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company and enjoyed a trip around
the bay on the ferryboat Berkeley.
A number of the convention members,
accompanied by their families, left for
Monterey, Santa Cruz and other near
points to spend the Sabbath at the famous
watering places.
The Brotherhood of St. Andrew held a
cession yesterday morning in the Young
Men's Christian Association rooms and in
the afternoon an open-air meeting: took
place in the Berkeley Hills. In the even-
Ing the brotherhood" gathered in Shattuck
Hall, Berkeley, many of the students and
faculty of the State University being pres
ent at the nrpetins:.
matters that came up for dis
cuss'cn were upon reports rendered by
various committees. The committee on
amendments brought in a favorable re
port upon the amendment offered by the
Rev. Dr. McKim of Washington on the
preceding day, but owing, to an inaccu
racy in the wording of the amendment it
â¢was withdrawn. When it is again report
ed on the members of the house will have
printed copies before them. It is based
on the amendment offered by Rev. Dr.
Huntingdon at a previous session of the
General Convention and there is every
likelihood of a keen debate.
The report of the committee on the
Apocrypha will be printed and the min
isters of the church are notified to use it
in reading their morning service.
The House of Deputies and the House
of Bishops held a joint session to listen
to the report of the committee on Chris
tian Education. The Bishop of Lexington
read the report, which was adopted.
THE session of the House of
Deputies yerterday morning
was a quiet one. The heat was
oppressive and the delegates
took advantage of the half
session to go visiting. The
Rev. Pr. Crammer at this stage renewed his
motion lo have the raport of the committee
on the apocrypha adopted. He asked to have
the rules of the house suspended so that he
mlKht take It from the calendar.
- By a two-thirds vote of the house the reso
APOCBYPHA ADOPTED.
Delegate J. Plerpont Morgan on behalf of
New York, seconded by a delegate from North
Carolina, demanded that the vote be taken by
dioceses and orders. The vote w,as so taken
and resulted almost unanimously in the af
firmative, there being only four clerical and
three lay votes in the negative.
A message from the House of Bishocs noti
fied the House of Deputies that its message
had been received and that the prelates would
attend the session at noon to discuss the sub
ject of Christian education.
MORGAN MAKES A MOTION.
The chair ruled that the only question be
fore the house was on the question of agree
ing oÂ» \u25a0 disagreeing to the report. :\u25a0
IN glorious weather the members of
the General Convention of the Epis
copal Church enjoyed a trip yes
terday afternoon around the Bay of
San Francisco as the guests of tha
Southern Pacific Railfpad Company
and a more joyous gathering has
never been seen on board the ferryboat
Berkeley.
The hour ct departure was 2:30 p. m and
it is estimated that fully 1400 people ac
cepted the invitation of the railroad com
pany. The ferryboat Berkeley looked
spick and span in new coats of paint and
whitened decks and the visitors comment
ed on the beauty of the commodious bay
vessel.
The affair waa free from all restraint
and Bishops, distinguished clergymen and
lay deputies to the convention assumed
an air more in keeping with a picnic gath
ering. The ladies of the party were gen
erally envied by their somber-garbed com
panions, for the fair ones, \u25a0with few excep
tions, had donned shirt waists on account
of the hot weather.
There were enough cameras and kodaks
in the party to fit out a good-sized store
and pretty views of the scenery around
the bay will be taken to far distant homes
as souvenirs of yesterday afternoon's out
ing.
The railroad company was represented
by "William McMurray of the Information
bureau ; T. L. ' Frazier, superintendent of
the Western division; H. R. Braden of tha
passenger department and K. A. "White,
steamer agent. The railroad officials re
ceived their guests at the gangplank of
the ferryboat and all were told to "make
themselves at home."
An orchestra was on board and dis
coursed music, which was not entirely of
a sacred character. Huge bowls of iced
lemonade were placed in charge of attend
ants on the lower deck and the clerical
gentlemen seemed to enjoy the task of car
rying the cooling drink in glasses to their
fair companions and relatives, seated on
the upper deck.
The Berkeley went along 1 the water
front in the direction of the Union Iron
Works and to Hunters Point, then turned
and made a wide detour for the Marin
shore, passed Angel Island, went through,
the Raccoon Straits, passing Tlburon and
Belvedere and came back by Alcatraz, the
Presidio shore and North Beach.
The various points of Interest were
pointed out to the visitors and many ex
clamations of delight were heard on all
sides. The bay trip lasted two fcours and
a half and the guests expressed them
selves as being under obligations to the
railroad company for a delightful outing.
Ings, presented as the action of the commit
tee named the following resolution:
"Resolved. That the report of the marginal
readings committee be accepted and the read
ings therein recommended be adopted which
are taken from the margin of Kins James'
version or from the English and American re
vised versions with their margins, and that
the commission be allowed before printing:
their readings to substitute for those not taken
from one or the other of these sources others
taken unchanged therefrom."
Rev. Dr. McKim of Washington moved that
this house accede to the resolution.
Rev. Dr. AlÂ«op of Lorn? Island arose to pro
pose an amendment, but being prevented by a
point of order said in explaining his purpose:
<# I think our commission has been treated with
marked diseourtesy. We have had a commis
sion appointed for six years. It has been doing
its best work. It has come here with a report
which from very many has received the
very hizhest commendation. I am not pre
pared to say, of course, that the house is
bound to accept what it has done, but the
house is at least bound to give it the cour
tesy of a vote, and it waa to that end that I
wanted to move something .that would allow
the house to vote. If that vote is adverse I
am heartily prepared to vote for the proposi
tion' which has been brought in by the com
mittee of conference."
Rev. Dr. Kccleson of Maryland disavowed
any such intentional discourtesy and asked the
house to say if any such discourtesy bad been
shown the committee.

Mr. Raynorâ That is just what we v/ant to
proveâ that he. had no orders except those con
tained In dispatches numbers 7 and 8.
Mr. Raynor then repeated h's desire to offer
the dispatch of May 27 In evidence, and after
a colloquy between Mr. Raynor and Judge Ad
vocate Lemly Mr. Hanna remarked that there
was no objection to putting It in except that
it was "obviously Intended to reflect on a
person v*'ho is not under inquiry."
To this Mr. Raynor responded that It was
not intended to reflect on any one, but that it
was Intended "to prevent a reflection on Com
r..cdoro Si'hley." It was decided that the dis
patch was already in evidence and Mr. Hanna
took the witnees for redirect examination. Ho
bogan by asking If he knew the reason for the
lapsf of five or six days between the sending
ot dispatches by the Hawk and the Wasp.
To this inquiry Mr: Raynor objected, and there
was quite a spirited argument on the part of
elicit information as to correspondence between 1
the two commanders and objection on the part
of Mr. Hanna to bringing In dispatches which
had no immediate bearing upon Commodore
Schley's conduct. Mr. Raynor said there was no
communication between thorn between May 21
and May 27. He then quoted the dispatch ot
May 27 as the first positive knowledge con
veyed to Commodore Schley of the presence of
the Spanish fleet at Santiago. This dispatch
was as follows:
"U. S. Flagship New York, St. Nicholas Chan
' ncl. May 27, 1SS8.
"Sir: Every report and particularly dally
confidential rcpoits received at Key West from
Havana state Spanish squadron has been in
Santiago de Cul>:i from the 19th to the 25th
Inst... inclusive, the 25th being the date of the
last report rccÂ» '.ved. You will please proceed
vlth all Kositle dispatch to Santiago to block
ade that port. If. on arrival there, you receive
positive Information of the Spanish ships hav
ing left you will follow them in pursuit. Very
respectfully, W. T. SAMPSOX."
Mr. Hannaâ What Is the first positive order?
Mr. Raynor â May 27.
Mr. Hannaâ Did he receive It on the 27th? \u25a0
Mr. Raynor â He- never received it on the 27th
(.liter being- prompted by Admiral Schley). He
got It on June 10.
Mr. Hannaâ How is it possible that he can
bp affected by an order after all the lapse of
time? . . . . \u25a0
After further effort on Mr. Raynor's part to
Correspondence of Commanders.
"The captain of the Hawk was called on
board and 1 remember his instructions were
to proceed with all uneed until he met the
Vesuvius and transmit the dispatch to her, as
she was a faster vessel. As to whether No. S
was inclosed with this I was not secretary
and-did not inclose it." .
"When did the Hawk leaver 1
. "She leit the Havana blockade, some dls
tajice west of Havana., about dusk on May 21,
probably about 6:20."
"Then you received this information on May
20 at 8:30 in the mornins and the Hawk lelt
at d'.:sk May 21?" â¢ , .
"That is correct." J,
T.l>e -witness said in reply to questions that
the memoranda beginning. "The inclosed in
structions will reach you." had not been sent
by the Iowa, as the dispatch was dated May
21 and the Iowa had left on the day previous.
Mr. Raynor â Was not the Hawk the first
'vessel that carried that memorandum?
"To the best of my knowledge the Hawk
was the first and only vessel that carried that
memorandum,". reDHert the witness.
"The Hawk left on May 21 and the first in
formation you had was about 8:30 or 9 o'clock
on the 20th. When did you get this second con
flrmatory information you speak of?" \u25a0
"I got it on shore at Key West about .7
o'clock on the evening of May 20."
"Then the confirmatory dispatch, as ' I un
derstand it, was received twenty-four hours
before the Hawk left with this memorandum
to Commodore Schley. Is that risht?" - \u25a0
"Yes, at Key West, and the Hawk was sent
from Havana." ' . -\u25a0
"Can you Rive me any subsequent dispatches
or memoranda that passed between Admiral
Sampson and Commodore Schley in reference
to the Spanish squadron being at Santiago?" '
"I do not think I can refer you to-any.
After Admiral Sampson heard that the "fleet
of Commodore Schley had not left Cienfuegos,
In other words, after he got a reply from
the commander of the flying squadron, he sent
the Wasp, I think, about May 26,' to Cienfuegos
with an additional dispatch, but she, of course,
did not arrive there until Commodore Schley
had left for Santiago, and I do not remember
what those dispatches were." -. â¢ :
"Was that the Wasp?"
"Yes.". "
"What daLe?" -. .
"My impression is she left by the old Ba
hama Channel. May 26."
â¢ "Then I understand that between the time
that the Hawk carried this . Information to
Commodore Schley at dusk on the evening of.
May 21 and the time when this dispatch was
sent from the Bahama Channel on the 26th
there was no communication between Admiral
Sampson and Commodore Schley in reference to
the Spanish squariron at Santiago. Was there?"
"I. thought I replied that there was no op
portunity for any." ;
Captain Lemly â Tell the court fully from
what source this information was received con
cerning the . arrival of Cervera's fleet in San
tiago. I would like you to Identify the tils
patch put into cipher at that, time, to which you
refer. .., t

to the effect iliat the fleet had entered the har
bor on Msv 13. v
The information came from an employe ot
the telegraph office at Havana, who could only
send his information at G o'clock, when others
were absent from the office there. .Captain
Allen had, the witness said, asked that great
secrecy be observed for the protection of the
operator, only agreeing that the commander In
chief and his staff should be informed. Later
Uie witness had returned to Key West and re
ceived confirmatory information. He then
stated that on the next morning. May 21, the
fleet proceeded, to the blockade of Havana, Ad
miral Sampson belnc satisfied that the infor
mation concerning the presence of the fleet at
Santiago was correct. The admiral accordingly
had calied up the Hawk and forwarded his dis
patches to Commodore Schley.
Lieutenant Commander Stanton related the
pcrtlculars cf hifc securing informations^ the
presence of Cervera's fleet at 8antiago. He said
that while the fleet under Admiral Sampson
lay at Key Wert on the morning of- May 20 he
went ashore. "While in the office of. Commodore
Remey. he eaifi. thei Captain Allen of the sig
nal office had rnlled him aside and told him
that he had received information of the pres
ence of tfie i. pnnlth fleet at Santiago. - which
he be-lieyed to b<} correct. â¢ The Information was
On re-direct examination Mr. Hanna brought
out the Information that the telegram of con
gratulation to Commodore Schley had been
based partially upon the capture of >t collier
with coal for the Spanish fleet, which capture
was made by C&ptain Slgsbee. â¢ . ,
Captain Chadwick also said that he had
drafted Admiral Sampson's second dispatch of
May 21. the one sent from Havana, and while
the dispatch from Key West, designated as No.
S, was sent at 3 o'clock, the second was sent
between 5 and C o'clock.
Captain Chadwick was then excused and Lieu
tenant Commander Sidney A. Staunton was
cÂ»liea. Before the witness took his seat Judge
Advocate Lemly asked and received permission
to rut In as â¢â¢vidence Admiral Sampson's offi
cial report n.^de at Guantanamo Bay, August
3 U98.
After Mr. Raynor had formally asked his
second question Captain Chadwick offered a
written reply, but Mr. Raynor objected, say
injr:
4- I must first read what he has written before
he answers. It might be something very ob
jectionable. Suppose he did protest? How does
that affect the case? What we wanted is the
congratulatory dispatch. Now, he brings in
something entirely different. If the witness in
answer to my pecon<! quection says 'Yes' or
"No,' I won'* object, but ,if he says anything
else I would like to have the opportunity of
seeing what he has written."
Captain Chadwick then tore up his written
reply and .viev. ercd verbally:
"I had ic potlally In mind."
Kaynor Makes Objection.
Raynor formally addressed the court, request
ing permission to ask the witness two ques
tions, which he outlined. He called attention
to his question put to Captain Chadwick yes
ttrday concerning a telegram of congratula
tion which Admiral Sampson had sent to Com
modore Schley on May 28. He Had asked the
witness if he remembered that message and
the witness had replied that he did remember
it very well, adding: "Because I protested
against his consTatulations."
Mr. Raynor 3ald that this last expression
was purely voluntary on Captain Chadwick's
part and wa3 not necessary in response to the
inquiry. The questions whicil he stated to the
court were as follows: ... \u25a0
â¢â¢First, when did you first learn of the ex
istence of dif;iatch No. 8 7 v
"Second. did you then, in pretesting against
the sending of this congratulatory dispatch,
refer to his blockade of Cienfuegoa in dispatch
No. S?" . ;\u25a0 .
Admiral Dewey stated the court had no ob
jection to the questions and Captain Lemly
said he would not- object, providing he could
cross-examine on the -points raised. Mr. Ray
nor did not concede this request, but before the
point was decided Mr. Raynor asked his first
question, as previously given to the court.
After reading the dispatch in question the
witness said:
"I was Informed of its purport at the time
It waE sent to the Marble head." ' .
"IMd you see It when it was sent to the
Marblehead"?
"I did not read it."
"When did you first read it?" â¢
"I did not read the original dispatch until
the answer was received from Commodore
Schley, brought by the Hawk."
"Was that dh May 26, when your ship was
at a point between Havana and Cape Francis,
in the vicinity of Cape Pedras"? ..
"Yes." \u25a0 . â¢ .
"Did you have the blockade of Cienfuegoa
in mind when you protested against the send
ing of the congratulatory dispatch"?
"May I ask if you mean that I had that
only in mind"' ?
'"I do not mean that. I mean whether you
had H in mind p.t all."
"I can gay I had H partially."

WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.â Captain F. E.
Chadrrick, who was Admiral Sampson's chief
of elaff during the war with Spain, continued
his testimony before the Sehley court of In

understood that Mr. Raynor will be prepared

TESTIMONY OF OFrTCEBS.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 12.-The
Schley court of inquiry held
but one session to-day, ad
journing at 1 o'clock untti
Monday in order to give those
engaged in the inquiry an opportunity lor
recuperation.
Captain Chadwick concluded his test!- '
rnony begun yesterday and Lieutenant
Commander S. A. Staunton, who served
on the New York as an assistant to Cap
tain Chadwick as thief of staff for Ad
miral Sampson, and Lieutenant Nathan
C. Twining, formerly of the Iowa, were
introduced as new witnesses.
Lieutenant Etaunton's testimony dealt ;
with dispatches forwarded by Admiral
Sampson to Commodore Schley. and while
he was ur.der examination Mr. Raynor
outlined a contention in behalf of 'Admiral
Schley to the effect that the dispatch
written on May 27 was the first positive ,
notice that the commander in chief had
given Commodore Schley of the presence
of the Spanish fleet in the harbor of San
tiago.
Lieutenant Twining said in his testi
mony that while the flying squadron oc
cupied u position of from three to five
miles out from Cienfuegos during the day,
the distance was increased to from sevon
to r.ine miles at night. He was in charge
of the eight-inch guns during the bora
fcardnicr.t of the Colon on May 31, and he
.said that all the shots from the American
fleet fell short.
Near the close of the session Judge Ad
vocate Lemly and Mr. Raynor became en
gaged in a controversy over the admissl

I do not think my brother wants that state

him "Neighbor, remove the beam from your

There was a ripple of laughter through the

it was noticed that Mr. Raynor did not ac

Captain Ltmlyâ If he states that' outside the

livered an address to men exclusively.
Bishop Gailor spoke on the Christian
standards for the development of man
hood, placing being true to one's serT as
the standard and ideal of a successful life.
He said:
There is enthusiasm in doing things good
and divine. It is a question of doing our best
for ourselves and the world in order that -we
may add to the sum total of righteousness with
which our God Is leavening the universe. Let
us believe in good in ourselves and in the
world. Men who do not believe in themselves
are a burden to society. Every, human' being
has in him the power through God to attain
unto grace, goodness and purity. \u25a0.

Though' nothing has been said, it has*
been felt that the football play was be
coming an exaggeration of the comic de
partment of the Blue and Gold, and there
was a slight danger of its going too -far,
as the Blue and Gold has occasionally
threatened to do. The play was always a
student production and \u25a0â¢ the originators
did not hesitate to handle professors, stu
dents and prominent men with the de-
and an alumnist of the State University.
But Professor Syle will be in charge of
the rehearsals, and announces aa his in
tention the giving of a performance of as
high dramatic standard as can possibly
be secured in the State University.
CAST OF THE UNIVERSITY
. FOOTBALL. PLAY, "THE FAN
TASTICS." l
Eddie Yarrow, alias Gallagher, was held
to answer before the Superior Court by
Judge Conlan yesterday on the charge of
burglary in $1000 bonds. Two similar
charges against him were dismissed. He
was accused of breaking into the room
of Mrs. Kate Edgerton, 1206 Stockton
street, and the rooms of two other board
ers and stealing a large quantity of jew
elry, which was recovered by Iietectives
Dinan and Wren. Yarrow was arrested
last December for breaking Into the resi
dence of Simon Donau, 1452 Franklin
street, but was acquitted by a Jury In
Judge Cook's court.
Yarrow Held for Burglary.
lightful frankness that characterizes the
uncergraduate.
And so the new scheme will be watched
,with interest. Professor Syle is deter
mined to make- the very best. that he can
out of his material and show that the
students of Berkeley are really capable
or a high grade of dramatic work, and it
is expected that the play will become a
matter of education and not solely of
amusement.
"The Fantastics" is one of. Rostand's
early romantic comedies. It is full of ca
pabilities both in situation and dialogue
The college presentation will be from a
rendering into English verse by George
Fleming. This translation is exceedingly
good and carries the author's meaning
well. â¢ .â¢
The cast has been selected from stu
dents and graduates who have already
shown their ability on the amateur stage.
They have taken part In good productions
and in a play where so much is possible
should do some really artistic work. The
characters have been cast as follows:

tion saloon ' on Sutter street, above
Kearny.
According to the statements of the
young men they were practicing the
new college football yell, some time aftrr
midnight. Some .person in one of the
neighboring buildings raised a window
and asked them to desist. In return the
yell was given with -renewed vigor, and
a pistol shot rang out on the air. The
students scattered, but were caught by
the police, their stories not Quite agroe

hurt by the discharge of the pistol.

BERKELEY. Oct. 12.â A departure
from . established custom', has
been made in regard to the play
that is annually given, by the
students of the State University
on the night of the day of the big foot
ball game. This year the football play
will be a legitimate drama . instead of a
burlesque and it will be given under the
supervision of Professor L. Du Pont Syle
Instead of under the unrestrained man
agement of the students.
The general supervision of this produc
tion was quietly turned over to Professor
Syle this year without any commepts.
Professor Syle at once left the farce and
burlesque written by some member of the
student body and announced that the foot
ball play v/ould be strictly legitimate and
announced Rostand's "The Fantastics" aa
the piece. '
Of course, the entire cast has been se
lected from the students, and the busi
ness management will be in the hands of

Special Dispatch to The Call
GEORGETOWN, Ky., Oct. 12.â When
court adjourned at 6 p. m. la the trial
of Caleb Powers, charged with being an
accessory to the murder of Governor
Goebel, the Jury had not been completed.
Six times the panel has been, accepted by
the commonwealth and each time It has
been .broken up by the peremptory chal
lenges of the defense. A special venire
of seventy-five more Bourbon County men
was ordered by Judge Cantrill late this
evening and the work of selecting: the jury;
will be resumed again at 9 o'clock MonÂ«<
day morning:.
When court opened at 9 o'clock to-day;
there were eleven men In the Jury box.
Gano Shropshire of Scott County was
temporarily accepted, Judge Cantrell
overruling the challenge of the defense
for cause and the panel was ailed. Tho
commonwealth accepted the Jury as It
stood. The defense challenged peremp
torily six of the men. The Jury list of
Scott County men was by this time ex
hausted and the box was refilled by men
drawn from the venire of 100 men from
Bourbon County, who had been brought
into court by the deputy sheriffs.
During the forenoon It became apparent
that these Bourbon County men had firm
ly grounded opinions as to the guilt or
innocence of the accused and they were
excused. "When the venire was exhausted
at 6 p. m. there were ten men In tha
jury box that had held eleven when court
opened in the morning. i

FAVORS RAISE
HUGE LIMIT
Givil Service Board to
Submit a Charter
Amendment.
The Board of Civil Service Commission
ers is considering the advisability of pre
senting an amendment to the. section of
the charter which provides that all per
sons appointed to positions in the fire ,
department must be not less than 21 nor
more than 35 years of age.
The proposed amendment, which will be
filed with the Committee on Charter
Amendments of the Board of Supervisors
for. final submission to the people, contem
plates the raising of the maximum age
limit required for fire department :\u25a0;\u25a0 em
ployes from 35 to 40 years.
This action on the part of the Civil Ser
vice Commission was prompted yesterday
by the application of a former locomo
tive engineer on the Southern Pacific
Railroad \u25a0 for. permission to â¢ take the next,
examination lor engineer In the fire ' de
partment. On being asked his age- the ap- ,
plicant told Chief Examiner Moran that
he was. 36 years of age. The applicant
vas thereupon informed that under' the
.charter, which set the age limit -at 35
years, he was barred from holding a posi
tion in the flre department and therefore
could not take the examination. .
The applicant appeared surprised, and
after â¢ Commissioner Freud had corrobo
\u25a0rated Moran's interpretation of ttie char
ter he proceeded to impart some informa
tion which may impel. the commission to
endeavor, to effect,a radical change in the
age requirement .mentioned. He declared
that locomotive engineers generally did not
become really competent until after they
had passed the age of 35, and he charac
terized the "fixing of the age limit by the
charter at that figure as absurd. He con
tended that the same responsibility de
volved on the engineer of a fire engine as
on that of a locomotive, and it was bad
policy to bar competent engineers because
they are ever 25 years of age.
President Freud of the commission ad
mitted the soundness of the applicant's
argument, and he. Immediately Issued a
call for a meeting of the commission, at
which the subject will be thoroughly dis
cussed. It is not unlikely that the other
two Commissioners will agree with Freud
that the section referred to needs amend
ment, and that the age limit will be rec
ommended to read from 21 to 40 instead of
21: to 35 years for employes in the flre de
partment. . -'

Always Afraid Something Dreadful
is Going to Happen. Why Should
Women Havejthe Blues More
Than Men?
: \u25a0 ' ? . ., ,
When a cheerful, brave, and light-hearted woman is suddenly
plunged into that perfection of misery, the blues, it is a sad picture.
It is usually this way :
She has been feeling out of sorts for some time, experiencing severe
headache and backache ; sleeps very poorly and is exceedingly nervous.
Sometimes she is nearly overcome by faintness, dizziness, and pal-
pitation of the heart; then that bearing-down feeling is dreadfully
weÂ£trin or *
Her husband says, "Now, don't get the blues! You will be all
right after you have taken the doctor's medicine.
But she does not get all right. She grows worse day. by day, until
all at once she realizes that a distressing female complaint is established.
Her doctor has made a mistake.
She loses faith : hope vanishes ; then comes the morbid, melancholr,
everlasting blues. She should have been told just what the trouble
was, but probably she withheld some information from .the doctor, who,
therefore, is unable to accurately locate her particular illness.
Mrs. PlrLkham has relieved thousands of women from just this
kind of trouble, and now retains their grateful letters inner library; as
proof of the great assistance she has rendered them. This same assist-
ance awaits every sick woman in the land. Write her to-day.

How Two '-Women Were Cured.,
" Deab MBS.' Pinkham : â I was troubled yery much, with female weakness, '
falling of the womb and "bearine do-wn pains. Could not walk fifty yards with-
out stopping to rest, and could not do my work. Life was a burden to me.

- MILLER & HOWARD. Proprietors.The Rose Gold Reclamation Company,
614 Call Building, this city, has awakened
a new and widespread interest among
mining men over the problems of reclaim
ing and saving the fine gold and platinum
values contained In deposits of auriferous
sands and gravels. Already contracts
have been entered into for placing a num
ber of plants in operation and the appli
ance is inspected daily by large numbers
of those whose attention has been called
to this really wonderful invention. That
it saves the gold and . platinum values
from sands Is an absolutely demonstrated
fact and a consideration but little' less im
portant is that it is simple and inexpens
ive both in construction and operation.

The work of scattering the sand can be done
by the regular street sweepers, and the results
of our experiments show that when the sand-
Ing is properly done the amount of extra work
in cleaning up and removing- this sand when
the etr-iet becomes dry is hardly appreciable.
We do not think it will be necessary to sand
all the bituminous rock or asphalt pavements,
as some of them do not become slippery.
Neither will it be necessary that the sanding
should be done every day, but only on such
days or parts of days as the conditions of the
weather may render the pavements slippery
enough to cause horses to fall. Believing that
the extension of this sandinc of the principal,
heavily traveled, smooth pavements will be
greatly appreciated by the public generally, we
respectfully submit the matter for the consid
eration of your honorable board.
We believe the only thing necessary tn this
matter would be for your honorable board to
provide a sufficient number of metal receptacles
along both sides of the blocks which are to
be sanded, and keen the same filled with the
suitable kind of sand.
Receptacles for the Sand.
We have no particular suggestions to offer
as to the manner in which this work should
be performed. Our experiments have shown us
that the two essential points are: (1) That
the Ban.I used shall be clean, sharp sea sand,
free from loam, and (2) that it should be very
lightly scattered over the street. We believe
the scattering car. be done better by hand than
by mechanical method, as the sand can then
be placed just where and when it is needed.
Demand for Noiseless Pavement. .
"The people generally demand that smooth,
noiseless pavements shall be used In the retail
districts. As a matter of humanity, however,
it is desirable that something should be done
to prevent the numerous accidents which are
continually caused- by the slippery character
of these pavements on days when the pavement
is slightly wee We fee! that the benefit to the
entire draylng and teaming community, if these
accidents can be prevented, will be more than
sufficient to compensate the city for the com
paratively smsll cost of the work, and that it
is the duty of the city to do something in this
matter.
Whereas it was a common sight on wet days,
before this was done, to see several horses
down on this block at the same time, we have
not heard of a single case of a horse falling
since this sanding has been performed.
The results ot this experiment have been so
satisfactory that we are convinced of the de
sirability of extending this sandlnc of the
pavements to such other smooth paved streets
in the heavily traveled business portion of the
city as require it.
We beg respectfully to report to your honor
able board that the experiment which thp
Merchants' Association has been trying, during
the last few weeks, of sanding the bituminous
rock pavement on Montgomery street, between
Bu*h and Pine, to prevent horses falling, has
proven a comDlete success.

Th<*re Is general uneasiness throughout

The Treka Journal predicts that a very
rich copper mining district will be devel
oped in the northwestern corner of Sis

mines are situated on Joe Creek, a tribu
tary extending In Siskiyou County to El
liott Creek on the State line and also at
Preston Park, near the Del Xorte County
line, several miles south of the Oregon
boundary.
The New York Commercial says that the
lower prices for copper cannot affect the
companies tha-t have been producing for
a fraction of the present market price.
Low prices must follow increased demand
and, in turn, bring great profit to those
who are producing copper on modern eco
nomical lines. Copper, like every other
commodity, and particularly those In
which great results often follow small in
vestments, must fluctuate in value. The
preat holdings of the metal made it highly
probable, some months ago, that there
would be a slump In prices.

MINERS PREPARE
FOR CONVENTION
With reference to the first count; charg
ing the prisoner with having presented a
faise. fraudulent and fictitious voucher,
the court said that- the evidence on the
part of the Government tended to siiow
that the United States was Indebted to
the Selby Smelting and Lead Company in
the sum of $49S 37, and a bill therefor had
been presented for payment, and by an
agreement- between - the Selby Company
and- Superintendent' Leach- the samefwas
on the same day offset. by a claim for the
same -sum'held by the â¢ Selby- Company
against â¢ the United States for material
furnished, and this bill had "Paid Marclv
2(5. 1900," indorsed upon it and was there
upon returned to the Mint. â¢ The court
continued:
I charge you that If the claim of the United
States .i gainst the Selby Company ,was settled
In the manner stated, such settlement. Was In
effect' a payment or satisfaction of the claim,
and after such settlement- the Selby Smelting
and Lead Company had no further . charge
against the United States. I further instruct
you that there was no excuse or defense for
the defendant presenting: that claim thereafter
for payment, with a full knowledge of \u25a0 the set
tlement. If the jurors are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that. he, Dlinmtck, presented
for payment on April 7 or on March 21,- 1900,
this voucher, knowing that the same had been
satisfied and that no money was due thereon,
and demanded payment of $498 37 and received
said sum from the' cashier, you must find the
i".ef enciant guilty on the tlrst count of the in
dictment.
With reference to the fourth count the
court charged that if the jury were satis
fied that Dimmick, not being the depos
itary of the money, had received it from
the cashier and used it in a manner not
prescribed by law. they should render a
verdict of guilty. .... ; ,
Mr. Collins took all the exceptions that
the law allowed him. The jury was out
less than half an hour. and. stood on the
first ballot ton for conviction and two for
acquittal. The maximum sentence that
can be imposed is five years' imprison
ment on each count.
Next Tuesday at 11 a. m. was the day
set for sentence, i *
Charge to the Jury.
It had bc^n the custom in the United States
Branch Mint in this city for many years be
fore Mr. Leach took- charge to sell t!i<> old
lead and other material to Junk dealers, but
Mr. Leach conceived the idea of saving it to
the Uovernment by having it shipped to the
refinery and the value thereof returned in
new material. It was thereiore impossible to
ascertain what was due to. the Mint lor such
old material until after the old lead h;Â»d been
rotined. The Government had never questioned
this method of do-ins business, and it should
be presumed therefore" to be lawful and
proper. Even if this method of disposing of
the old materials' were, irregular, it does not
justify the defendant in using the money of
the Government for his own purposes.
Judge de Haven charged the jury, but
he read the charge in a tone so low that
the majority of tne persons in the-court
room could barely glean the context. He
advised the jury that the second count of
the Indictment had been stricken Out on
demurrer, and that the Government had
failed to prove the third count, which
charged embezzlement. He therefore in
structed the jury to render a verdict of
not guilty on the second and third counts.
In reply to the attacks made upon Su
perintenuent Leach, Mr. Denson made the
following statement in substance: \u25a0
Eeplies to Attack on Leach.
The result of the trial was a substan
tial victory for the prosecution after a
battle brilliantly fought on both sides.
The counsel for the Government, United
States District Attorney Woodworth, ex-
Judge S. C. Denson and his' law partner,
Bert Schlesinger, were handicapped by the
fact that according to the testimony of
Cashier Cole, their chief witness, the
finacial and clerical affairs . of the Mint
were conducted in an extremely unbusi
nesslike manner, and by the further fact
that Cole paid out J49S 37, to Dimmick on
a worthless voucher without making any
entry of that transaction, although at the
time he thought it peculiar, and tnat Cole
made no report of tne aiiair to Superin
tendent Leach until ten months' after
ward. \
The task of removing this handicap was
intrusted to Mr. Denson, who mane the
concluding argument for the Government
yesterday forenoon, ihe counsel opened
the matter with tact and . discretion.
He said that oniy for tne fact that Attor
ney Collins had read to the iury garbled
extracts from the evidence he wouid "have
no hesitation in submitting the case to
the jury without argument.'
Walter N. Dimmick, ex-chief- clerk of
the Mint, Was found guilty yesterday, by

to Cashier Cole of the Mint a false, ficti
tious and fraudulent voucher for $498 37,
and the fourth count charged him, not be
ing a depositary of public money, witn
having appropriated and used that sum
for a purpose contrary to law. ; \u25a0 ; \u25a0 !

Here is a man with a message! The re-
markable â¢ reception given to "The Re-
ligion of Democracy" showed that his mes-
sage is a vital one. In this new book it is
â¢clearer, the style more lucid and no less
brilliant, the note of confident . hope
stronper and fuller. In an "age of intel-
lectual depression" it rings out like s a
bugle note on a frosty, morning. Under
Mr. Ferguson's pen Christianity is ;no
longer seen as .mere eccl?siast!cism, but as
a new world-order, of which -Americanism
is the foreshadowing; the University,
broadened and democratized, the center;
the affirmative intellectâ the intellect that
. creates, â¢ Initiates. ' leadsâ Is the- - dominant
force. The part to be played by the Prot-
estant Episcopal Church is of special In-
terest-.

Hay continues in light receipt and very firm
at the recent advance. Dealers say. however,
that the flrmnes3 is temporary and fictitious
and chiefly due to the scarcity of cars on both
of the large overland lines. A few days ago
the Southern Pac. fie refused to allow any of
its cars to be loaded with Hay and on the
luth the Santa Fa followed suit, issuing an
order receiving no Hay between 'San Francisco
and Stockton for ten days from that date.
Dealers sav thst there is plenty of Hay In
the country, but under these conditions it is
impossible to get it in, hence the firmness of
the market. The same scarcity oÂ£ cars was
observed last year."

KEW TORK. Oct. 12.â The cause of the re
lapse of prices in to-day's stock market was
not altogether clear, but the same was true
of the sudden advance of yesterday and the
day before. ' Distrust of that movement and in
credulity as to the rumors which were set
afloat to account for It because of some intrin
sic grounds of improbability seemed to be the
reason for to-day's reaction. The same bro
kers, commonly supposed to act for the same
large Standard, Morgan. Harriman and Gould
interests, were active In buying and. bidding up
stocks ' to-day, as they were yesterday. St.
Paul was especially lifted again and again
by main force to 167, but the last price was
164%, only a shade above the lowest, the course
of that stock forming an epitome of the whole
market:' The Central and Southern transcon
tinental stocks were nearest to it In point of
activity, but the advance showed a tendency to
spread beyond yesterday's narrower limits un
til the enormous realizing forcing prices back.
Prices generally show losses on the day run
ning from 1 to 1% in the leaders and from that
up to 3% in St. Paul and, the local traction
stocks, which were notably weak throughout.
The decreased loan item of the banks failed
to show the full effect of the repayment dur
ing the week of some $15,003,000 of New York
City revenue warrants and the supposition
was. therefore, made that foreign bankers con
tinue their borrowing In the local market to
repay foreign borrowings. The disturbance in
the Paris money markets points to the likeli
hood of a continuance of this process. The mar
ket closed weak at the lowest.
There has been some upward action in the
stock market during the week following: the
rather prolonged period of depression. The
presence of liquidation was distinctly relaxed
during the early days of the week, but there
was manifest hesitation about taking up the
movement for an advance, and even the un
covered bears were not 'apparently in great
haste to cover their short contracts. For sev
eral days the market waverod before a pro
nounced advance drove the bears to cover. The
opposing arguments of the speculative element
now represent the belief on the one hand that
the depression In the stock market has had
no other cause than the depletion of money
supplies by the autumn requirements, and on
the other hand the apprehension that the last
great cycle of prosperity has reached Its crest,
with a prospect of gradual decline and shrink
age of business and earnings to be faced. The
first named element are confident that the sea
son's interior requirements for money are
about satisfied, or that the banks are in pos
session of sufficient resources at present to
meet the demands without forcing further li
quidation In the stock -market. It is urgued
that surplus reserves cf the banks now are
$17,483,175, compared with $4,463,920 at this time
last year, and $1,177,350 in 1S90. The move
ment of currency to the interior last year after
this, date amounted to $13,8)2,000, and termin
ated In the last week of October. In 1S99 the
movement continued into the third week in
November, but the amount moved after this
\u25a0date was only $ll,58"i,G00. Last year, however,
there was a free movement of jrold from Lon
don during October. This year there is no pres
ent prospect of such a movement. The cotton
crop has been very slow in moving and this
may involve a considerable further demand for
currency from the South, with the possibility
of a resulting pressure upon the exchange mar
ket that may bring gold. Nothing in the re
cent markets has po clearly demonstrated the
extent to which cnpltal was embarked in the
enterprices of the boom period of this year as
the recent, course of the foreign exchange mar
ket. The employment of hundreds of millions
of dollars by capitalists and syndicates In the
furtherance of community of "Interest projects
among the railroads and in the formation of the
United States Steel Corporatfon was well known
to the public, and there were self-congratula
tions upon the unruffled composure of our
money market under the unprecedented de
mands put upon it. The summer's events in
dicate that not only our own money market,
but those of pretty much the whole world be
sides, were drawn upon to provide the credits
for the gigantic undertakings of American syn
dicates. These foreign borrowings have ap
parently involved the sale of bankers', exchange
bills of distant maturities, which were left un
covered; . relying upon the autumn outward
movement of merchandise to replenish the sup
ply of exchange and enable them to cover. The
belated movement of cotton, the decreased corn
export and the .falling oft in manufactured pro
ducts, especially Iron and copper, have kept
down the supply of exchange and have made
this repayment of foreign loans especially effec
tive In sustaining the exchange market and
keeping it away from the gold import â¢ point.
Moreover, the repayment of these foreign loans
has been followed to a large extent by rebor
rowing in this market, so that the loan account
of the* New Tork banks has been maintained In
spite of the extensive liquidation In the stock
market. These are symptoms of the extensive
taking, up of capital not to* be Ignored, and
they bring forward the problem of how far the
year's great financial projects will warrant the
sanguine expectations of them during the spec
ulative excitement of .last year.' The panic In
May caused by the Northern Pacific corner and
the assasFlnation of President McKinley upset
the calculations of these promoters and their
original prosperous efforts to dfcstrlbute tho
crop of securities which were issued to reim
burse the syndicates for their outlay and In
their elaborate plans for the recuperation of
the market to enable them to renew the process
of distribution. With th<Â» additional. . outlay
made necessary by the measures' for support
ing the. market, the coming of the autumn re
quirement for â¢ money forced ' some retrench-

liberal at the Etart, but the actual selling was
on a small scale and of a nature that indi
cated a desire on the :iart of the buyers to
depress the market wltli a view to buying in
again. Commission-houses began to buy and
a report of a good demand for the Southwest
and New .York broujrht an upshoot in prices
until December told at 70%c. Local tradsrs
also helped by considerable buying, but toward
the end ot tlje short session profit-taking eased
the \u25a0 market- and December closed steady, a

Table Grapes were In light supply and owing
to the hot weather and the shipping demand
for the Victoria steamer good stock sold read
ily at an advance. The same may be saia
of Figs. Watermelons cleaned up at an ad
vance. There waa but one car on the market.
Good Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons were
scarce and higher.
Receipts of Peaches were still light; they
are doing better. Some late Clings sold at $33
@40 a ton. New crop Grape Fruit is coming
in more freely and Is bringing the top quota

WASHINGTON.- Oct. 12. -To-day's statement
of the Treasury balance shows:
Available cash balance, fl65,S74.619; gold,
$100,334,426.
Condition of the Treasury.
Â£!^Â£ r . han , tnat f h . own b y the statement. The
payments of municipal taxes last week were
about twenty-five million dollars " and this
amount of tax warrants was at once liquidated.
Jif^^ 1 -! 111 ** e . 1 2 an ltem did * ot fuIl y re-
Beet this large liquidation would seem to show
that the greater part of the money released
through payment of the warrants was im
mediately reloaned. This would indicate a dis
position on the part- of the banks to expand
loans, which they would seem to be Justified in
doing, considering the comparatively larise
surplus reserve now being carried. It is note
worthy â¢ that the scale of operations of the
sub-treasury last week resulted in a loss to
the banks of }2, 070, 700. These .excess receipts
over disbursements will doubtless increase,
tending ultimately to an Important decline of
bank reserves.. It Is unlikely, however, for
the reason above noted that this absorption of
surplus by the Treasury will have a deranging
effect on bank conditions in the near future. â¢
ment, which exposed some weak spots In the
market, especially among the minor industrials,' ;
which have notably affected the public confi
dence In securities. The future of the market
is by no means clear, although the usual up
ward reactions which are normal t<$ any de
cline in stocks are bound to occur. .
â¢ Expert views on the outlook in the iron in- i
dustry are not at all sanguine. Present activ
ity of production is held to be due to making
up orders delayed by the steel strike and some
eagerness is shown to secure contracts run
ning into next year. A session of Congress is
a depressing influence by tradition upon the
stock market, especially where a revision ot
the revenue law is in contemplation. Specula- '
tive sentiment is therefore somewhat Hl-de
flned. I
Railroad bonds have been in better demand at
some advance In prices, . . "

For several days smoldering ashes from
a small brush tire on the Nicholson tract,
close to PranedaJe, about*six miles from
Salinas, have frequently started fresh
tires. This afternoon they again burst Into
Ilaxnes and soon more than 200 acres of
fine timber and undergrowth were de
stroyed.
The flames were got under partial con
trol, but a light wind this evening fanned
the dying embers into a fresh blaze, and
now the fire ls spreading with great
rapidity, working back of Prunedale and
down the canyon toward Xatividad, a few
miles from here. Fuel ls added to the
flames by the dense undergrowth and
dry grass and leaves.
From Chualar Canyon, a few miles
eouth, private dispatches received to
night give Information that a forest lire
that started this morning has got beyond
control, and it is feared that thousands
of acres of wooded land will be burned
over. Men there and at other points are
fighting heroically to subdue the flames.
PACIFIC GROVE, Oct. 12.â The forest
fire that has been causing so much loss
In this section for the past two days is
still burning fiercely, a change in the wind
having caused the flames to spread south
ward and Involve new territory. Thou
sands of acres of oak and pine timber
and young trees and miles of fences h~"e
been destroyed, the property burned or
being the Doud and Jacks tracts back or
Monterey and the Pacific Improvement
Company's celebrated seventeen-mile
drive reservation near Pacific Grove.
More than 4000 acres of the latter tract
alone has been ablaze, but the fire fight
ers have succeeded in -getting the flames
there eomewhat under control. The fa
mous cypress grove was saved and the
flames have been kept from the main
driveway. The fire is driving game from
the woods Into the open.
SALINAS, Oct. 12.â Since this morning
reports of a discouraging jiature concern
ing: the forest tires In the vicinity of Sa-
Jinas have been received. To-night the
ekles In every direction are illuminated.
From the northern end of San Miguel
Canyon comes the news that the fire has
already consumed the timber on hundreds
of acres of land and ls still spreading.

C01TSPICTJ0TJS IN A BALLROOM.
Flakes of Dandruff on the Collar and
Shoulders of a Gentleman in
Pull Dress.
This ls the thing you quite frequently
see In the ballroom â a man's black dress-
coat literally covered with dandruff.
It must be annoying to the wearer, and
certainly not a pleasant thing to observe.
But dandruff can be eradicated. It is a
germ disease that will some day cause
baldness.
Newbro's Herpicide kills the hair-de-
stroying- germ, and stimulates the hair
to a rich, abundant growth: it does more
âkeeps the hair soft and pliant.
Furthermore, Herpicide is a most pleas-
ant toilet accessory; pleasing of odor, and
cooling to the scalp.
