THE sacrifices of the dead stirred the patriotism of the
living yesterday, while garlands were placed with lov
ing hands' upon grass-grown mounds of Civil War
heroes and upon the yellow earthy heaped "above graves
lately made to receive the bodies of men who died
for their, country in jthe" jungles and rice paddles of
the Philippines. Never have the soldier heroes buried
in San Francisco cemeteries ; been remembered with . more of
deep, genuine affection and homage than on -this first Memo-,
rial day of the new century, which found; peace restored and
the glory of American arms and. the valor of American man
hood more lustrous ever on "the scroll of, fame.
Citizens gathered by thousands on the ; grassy slopes of the
National Cemetery in the Presidio and among tnVgray monu-;
ments of the Odd Fellows' 'Cemetery to stand' with uncovered
and bowed heads while veterans spoke in tender remembrance
of their departed comrades, who once .fought shoulder to
shoulder with them, and to look on 'with moist eyes while
trembling hand* scattered roses and lilies, carnations and
sweet peas and all the beautiful and fragrant blossoms of Cali
fornia gardens upon the graves of comrades. Men and women
. and children gathered at' night in two great audiences that lis
tened to song and story and to. the eloquent tributes of noted
orators to the brave lives and noble sacrifices of the soldiers
and sailors who fill heroes' gravesA . . *Â»

Brides the mere fact that the local j
were victorious in the game at Recrea
tion grounds yesterday the defeat was
administered in such a manner as to
bring delight, to every fan's heart. Up to
the eighth inning neither side had be?n
able to advance a man to the homo sta
tion. But in- the eighth, the fatal eishth.
when the fondest hopes of the enthus -uits
from the south were blighted. Hil<!e
brand started the procession with a cle&n
hit to left.- He was advanced to the sec
ond cushion by Schwartz with a hit to
first, Kniff followed with a line drive
ovef second. Just a little too high for
Brlseno. sending- Hlldey to third. Then
Pabst stole softly to the plats imld the
plaudits of an expectant host. Hale
rolred ud one of his most subtle curlers,
which the leader of the Dutch landed en
for a three-base hit clear to the center
field fence. Hildebrand and Krug both
came home. Pabst. after his. heroic per
formance, was not to be allowed to dU- on
third. He was brought home on a ba**Â»
hit by Graham to left <Here ended thÂ«
run-making.
The game was full of sharp fleWInjp.
Ions running catches and accurate throw
ing. Not a> single error was accredited to
the locals.
Iburg allowed but flvs scattered hits,
struck out two and lssaed but a single
free transportation.

NEWMAN furnished the
/T excitement at Tanforan track yes
(l â¢'>. terday during the races of the
N^^ Golden Gate Park Driving Asso
ciation. He participated in the
third event, which was a double-team
race, and while cotn<? at top speed around
the turn the KÂ«rth band on one of his
horses broke. The team took fright, and
despite all hla efforts Newman was unable
to control the steeds. He managed to hold
them for & part of < he Journey, but at the
last quarter the horses took the bits In
their teeth and raced down the home-
stretch at breakneck speed. The specta
tors wore on their feet. Friends yelled
to Newman to hold his scat and the driver
obeyed them. Ho took a double wrap of
the lines around his- hands and pulled
back with ail hts atrengtb. but with little
avail. The horava could not be stopped.
Dr. DalzJel. who was on horseback, gavo
chas.Â«. but was left far behind. Again the
team dashed around the track, and New
man, seeing that he could not stop his
horses, gave them a free rein and let
them tire themselves out. Only until they
had done so was he able to bring them
to a standstill. Fortunately for the driver

to ret the King going again and the
swift horse rapidly closed the gap be
tween himself and the leader. In the
stretch King Cadenza broke for an In
stant, but managed to pass under the
wire a winner. Mattle B was winded at
the finish. The deciding heat .was won
by the King In clever fashion. Mattle B
was second and Sable Le Grande, driven
by his owner, R. E. MIzner, was third.
The time for the fastest beat was 2:24.
The lost race of the day was captured
by James O* Kane's Sandow in straight
heats. J. Doran's Lady G gave the win

called the big holiday stake events In the
heart cf the season. It was not only big
1n numbers but ca^er in betting and. as
the first choices divided the honors with
ih.e outsiders, these who jostled one an
other In the rinp and the chalk manipu
lators distributed the plunder In about
vqual portions.
The Memorial handicap for two-year
olds and the Decoration handicap for
three-yenr-olds and up were the two
Â«venis on the card which furnished sport
cf more" than the ordinary quality., In
l>ath hcndlraps the favorites were/sup
j'larnrd by the second choices. Doublet
being: an easy winner in a Held of, Cix
and Vasallo Just eapturlnp the MÂ«mo
r'al cx-ent from Louwe'.seti by neck elo'nir-
t-.xlca Â£t the wire.
Good Hope was ih<? favorite in the slx
furlor.g- handicap, but Armstrong* on
Doublet ;eo!r the lead at the verylstart
tnd. separating from the bunch, was
i ever distanced. Good Hope tacked on.
but Hear cculd not cut down the Initial
lead to keep the dayUght from shomine.
Mission &r.d Dclly Welthoft were both
well played, but that Ss the most that can
be said of thea.
When Vssallo. corning from behind,
r.ot-ed cut Louwelsea for the first money
in the twt>-year-cld handicap the crowd
taw an exciting- finish. At the 3tretch
I.ouwelsea hp.d a comfortable, lead, but
was not peme cnouch to hold on. and Bas
fc!i:gw had the pleasure of seeing the
Â¦wings en the money flap. Jarretierre d'Or
was in the race all- the time, but got no
Letter than third money.
The wannest tip of the day struck the
rins Uie a 13-iach projectile before the
third race, which was won by Ralston.
In little time the Â»>enci!ers reduced the
odds on this horse by unit stages from 7
to I to 4 to 1. Stmnfre to say, a second' tip
was generally circulated, this time on
Duckoy. backed from 6 to 3. Ralston fin
ished ahead of Duckoy with broad flashes
o? daylight between them. Nullah, rid
den by Burlinjcame. was champion for
four furlongs out of the six, giving way to
the purse and clace winners.
The mile and a quarter event for four
year-olds was wen by Alicia, with the
"LJttle Lord" Fauntleroy In the pilot box.
Lost Girl, at 10 to I. looked to be the win
ner, but the fight on the stretch gave
Alicia the money by a working neck.
Pat Morrfssey, as soon as the falling
Â¦was clear, cams booming into port in the
first race. Rio Chico and Rinaldo wore
themselves out and on the stretch Do
nstor rollÂ«Â»d In tor the place. " - ' -. Â¦
Einstein was a warm tip in the last race.
cne ar.d a sixteen miles, and was heavily
played until tho money be pan to find a

nne and everything- went off so smoothly
end expefiitiously and the various events
were so keenly contested that every one
was fully satisfied. The games were not
started till after 11 o'clock, but, although
there were forty events on the pro

Thirty-Fifth Annual Gathering of the Caledonian Club Draws
Cro\yd That Fills the Grounds and Distances AIL Previous
Picnics Given by the> Organizationâ Events Keenly Contested
Chairman Frank Miller of the executive
council reported on. the uselessneM of the.
special committee appointed to protest to
Congress againÂ»r the Injustice of taxing
bankers' capital and reserves while ex
empting capital engaged In every other
enterprise. Tho law. still remains .un
changed. The. legislative Amendment to
exempt from taxation bonds ' of State,
counties, cities and municipalities, which
was defeated, will be again submitted to
the people at the election of 1301 .
It wait recommended that a special com
mittee be numnl to urge the Legislature
to adopt a uniform law of negotiable in
struments which within the past few
years has been adopied in other States.
The report of G. W. Kline, treasurer,
showed that during the year the. receipts
and balance on hand amounted to 94317,
and the* disbursements to 12319.
Secretary R. M. Welch reported 'the '
membership of the association as 198. a
gain of forty-seven In the last year. There
were Â£57 bank* doing business In Califor
nia on September 12. 1900, and eighty-nine
of these arÂ« outside the association.
"Abuse of Banking Privileges as Prac
ticed in tho Mutter of Commercial Collec
tions" was the subject of a paper by H.
8. Fletcher of the Bank of Watson ville.
It dealt with country banks and called
attention to . what bankers call "lamo
duck" collectionsâ that class of collections
â¢for which banks receive drafts when . the
drawer knows quite well that the darwee
will not honor the same. "Let us compel
payment for each service we perform,"
said Mr. Fletcher.! "A bank is neither a
bloodsucking corporation or a dispenser
of gratuitous labor. It is an Institution
for the conduct of legitimate and prorlta
ble business. Let It be generally under
stood and agreed between the banks that
no draftn will be presented unless pay
ment for handling them Is prepaid. Sucn
proceedings will cut out .the collections
that have no business in banks."
This evening tho bankers spent in social
chat about tho hotel corridors. Among
those who wUl contribute papers to-mor
row are Honry Brunner of the Oermania
Trust Company- of Ban Francisco. "Some
Essentials of the Modern Corporation";
C. W. Bush of the Bank of Yolo, "The
Banker and the Patron"; James K. Lynch
of the First National Bank of San Fran
cisco, "Corporations as Bank Customers";
J. J. -Morey of the Pajaro Valley Bank,
"Tho Client of a Country Bank. | Satur
day the delegates will be the guests of
local bankers. ,
-About fifty delegates; consisting of bank
presidents, cashiers and directors, were
present when First Vice President J. M.
Elliott of Los Angeles called the meeting
to order at 11 o'clock. President O. Alt
sciiiil is in the East. Lovell White of San
Francisco, who was to respond to the ad
dress of welcome, was- not present, and
the session drifted Into an informal affair.
This afternoon Judge J. R. Lewis of this
city delivered van address of welcome to
the visitors. He greeted the delegates in
behalf of the Garden City and was pleased
to meet the representatives of "institu
tions at whoso magic touch shops opened,
trains loaded, manufactures â¢ revived,
farms, vineyards and orchards were made
to produco and whose means sent abroad
trains and ships freighted with our indus
tries." In reviewing the resources of
SantaClara County he gave the follow
ing estimates of the coming crop, which,
he said." he had secured from growers:
. The prune yield would be one-eighth of
a crop, which means 15,000.000 pounds, but
there were oO.OOU.OOO pounds still on hand;
the apricot crop would be from 20 to 25
per cent, cherry crop not more than one
eighth, and the peach yield from 25 to 30
per cent. The local banks had a total
paid-up capital of S1.M7.000 and 14,875,000 In
deposits, of which latter sum 30.5 per cent
lay In the vaults.
Mr. White was still absent, and Vice
President Elliott responded briefly to
Judge Lowls' greeting. He said they were
glad to come to San Jose. It was truly a
garden city, and now that it was on the
main line of travel thousands of tourists
who visit the south would come here. He
predicted a brllilant future for the city.
President Aluchul's report was read
by Vice PrestJent Elliott. The banking
business In California was reviewed, and
tho nnanctal question In general. It was
the opinion of the cuthor that the funda
mental principles involved in the financial
question turned the scales and carried the
day, "and must be considered the primary
and mo.Â«t decisive ca.uses of the RepubU
can success in the last national cam
paign." He raid the majority of. banks
have made good use of the Improved con
ditions in the pant few years to solidify
their position. \ .The association . showed
satisfactory progress since tbo last con
vention. *,--' Â¦Â¦Â¦: ''â¢Â¦:'*â¢ â¢Â¦,Â¦Â¦-.Â¦:
Many interesting questions will be dis
cussed. One of these' is that of taxation.*
Under existing methods bankers .claim
that it often occurs that capital interested'
in corporations pays taxes twice, and in
many States this is an interesting ques
tion at present! In' some States the man-'
ufacturlng plant is taxed at its full value
and the holder of the stock Is also taxed
for the value of his holdings." In: these
instances, j it Is claimed, the same prop
ertyâthat" is. moneyâ is taxed twice. It
is argued that if Â¦ the ' plant is taxed Â¦ the
stock should : not, be, risf. the certificate of
stock simply shows the holder has money
interested in the plant'

SEVEN YEARS OF WORK.
UPON the record of work accomplished during
,-. the seven years of its history the Merchants'
Association had good reason to be gratified
when it assembled in annual meeting at the Academy
of Sciences on Wednesday evening. It is to be
doubted if any other city in the world has' a body of
public-spirited men who by voluntary effort have
nchieved so much for the public good within anything
like a. similar space of time.
A few California gentlemen of the cloth complain
that people are too prone to look upon matrimony as
a picnic. would be interesting to know what the
critics would think if most of us viewed the solemn
state as a bear fight.
Such, then, are the ideals of Stanfordâ a , compre
hensive course of instruction directed in the case of
each student 1 to specific ends useful to the'eommunity I
and di re'eted by a" teaching force composed ? of . men ! j
The most interesting part of the address was that
dealing with the teaching of the university and
the principles governing its selection. On that point'
the president said: "Compared 'with; the character
of the faculty every other clement in the' university
is of relatively little importance. Great teachers *
make a university great. â¢ The" chief duty of i the col-*
lege president is ! the choice of teachers. If he has
learned the art of surrounding himself with men who
are dean, ftane and scholarly, all other nutters of uni
versity administration , will take care of themselves.
He cannot fail if he has good men around him. And
in the, choice of teachers the clement of personal sun-,
ity seemed of first importance to Mr. Stanfordâthe'
ability to see things as they are. The university chaJr
should be the center of clear seeing, from which right 1
acting should radiate." ,/ ' t * '
Stanford held the belief that the essential part of
education is the thorough knowledge of some one
thing that-would fit the student for a useful life; he*
would have the study of literature and the study of
engineering pursued side .by side jit order that the
student of cither should have ttig benefits of the in-*
fluences emanating from" the other; the courses of
instruction wer^ to be open to men and to women
alike, but it was not desired by the founder to make
4he university notable mainly for the number. of its
students.". Stanford knew, as Dr. Jordan says, "that^
a few hundred men well" trained and under high in
fluences would count for more than as many thou
sands hurried in droves over a ready-made , curri
culum." . * ; .
In the first place it is noted that the founder
"would leave the university free to grow with the
coming ages. He would extend no dead hand from
the grave to limit its activities or to* control 'its' move
ments. The deed of gift is in favor of education pure
and simple." It was designed to be a democratic in
stitution, and Dr. Jordan says: "No other university
has recognized' so distinctly the absolute democracy
of knowledge.-"** * * No class of men are chosen
to the exclusion of others, and no class of studies is
given a 'fallacious importance through force of aca
demic pressure or through inertia of academic tra
dition."
After pointing out that the university, though but
ten years old, has made a character for itself and
must be judged by it, and that character is the result
ant of the initial impulse, the ideals developed and
the resistance of surroundings. President Jordan pro
ceeded to outline the nature of the initial impulse, the
founder had given to the university and to describe
the ideals which have developed from it.

PRESIDENT JORDAN'S address to the gradu
ating class at Stanford upon the "Educational
Ideals of Leland Stanford" was evidently de
signed for a wider circle than the academic audience
that heard it. In some measure it is a vindication of
the university from the adverse criticism to which it
has been subjected. Of course no direct reference
was made to the critics or to their criticisms, but at
the same time the purpose of Stanford and the spirit
that animates it were set forth with a degree of em
phasis which doubtless owed much of its fervor and
eloquence to the fact that such criticisms have been
made.

The : Federal courts are still sending out of the
country the coolie "native daughters" 'of Chinatown.
It might not be amiss to send their white sponsors
on the same journey.
The South has had one more illustration that burn
tag st the stake does not prevent crime", and yet that
savage sort of lynching has been repeated; so it seems
evident that unless vigorous measures be taken to
prevent it the common run of people in that section
may relapse Â«<nto, barbarism. ;.^.
An English engineer it quoted aÂ» laying that .the
greatest menace now visible to British manufacturing

willing to work thii off at a reasonable rate, and

Who knows but a vigorous bombarding might loosen
the grip of the San Jose scale, affright the red spider,
knock the thrip silly, and even kill the destructive
phylloxera?
We owe it to France that the cannon is now added
to the spear and sword as capable of useful conver
sion to the purposes of the agriculturist. In that
country the furious charge of hailstorms, threatening
the vineyards, has been turned by a vigorous can
nonading. Having conquered Jack Frost in the form
of hail. French ingenuity has turned upon him in his
more s-ubtlc form, and the destructive white and black
frosts are rendered powerless to do harm by firing
cannon over the vineyards, orchards and fields until
they are thickly covered with the powder smoke of
battle. By preventing radiation of heat this paH
either raises the dew point or by excluding the sun's
rays protects the vine* against the sudden change of
temperature which destroys them.
It is also proposed to train cannon on the mobile
and voracious grasshopper and cause him to cease to
be a burden to the agriculturist, as he was in Egypt.
We hail these economic and constructive uses of
the deadly cannon. In California we have long known
and used artificial cloud or fog, produced by smoke,
Â£s a protection frpm frost. As there is more fun and
noise in firing a cannon for the same purpose it will
no doubt become popular. While the country is at
peace, which we pray may be the case most of the
time, the army and the guns might be well employed
in shooting grasshoppers and fighting frost Such
use would reconcile fearful , people to an increase in
the standing army, and would introduce army officers
to our rural society.
oitcn that the phrase must be fatigued.
There is scriptural authority for the conversion of
small arms into plows and pruning-hooks, and that
happy agricultural figure has pleaded the advocates
of peace, and post-martial oratory has ridden it so
HERETOFORE it has been the proud privilege
of the people to secure captured cannon or
cannon of obsolete patterns to adorn town
plaras and courthouse iauns, and in some cases to be
noisily fired on the Fourth of July.

At the meeting of the Confederate Veterans' Asso

schoot histories in which it was stated: "We South
ern people once regarded Abraham Lincoln as one of
the most despicable creatures that ever lived; now,
while we do not indorse the policy which he pursued,
we honor him for his unquestioned sincerity, patriot
ism and ability": , so now the bloody chasm may be

While at the present time the Canadian country
around the Klondike holds the foremost place among
the northern gold fields and Dawson is the metropolis
of the whole country, there are good reasons for be
lieving that on the American side of 'the line there
will yet be richer mining camps than any in the Cana
dian provinces. The Nome mines are known to be
rich, and their output would this year have been very
large had not the intrigue* of Judge Noyes and Re
ceiver McKenzie involved so many 'of them in law
suits it was impossible to work them.. After the ex
perience McKenzie has had with the Circuit Court of
Appeals and that which awaits Judge Noycs when he
gets here to answer the charges against him, it is riot
likely there will be any further interference -on their
part with the miners cither at Nome or elsewhere.
Accordingly we may look for ft rapid development of
Alaska at all favorable points and count the country
as a valuable addition to pur Pacific Coast markets.
In short, there is every reason to believe that Alasj
kan trade and travel have now settled down
to a solid basis. The crowds that go north are no
longer made up mainly of dreamy visionaries or needy
and reckless adventurers. Men of capital and Of good
business sense have taken hold of the. country, and
with the accustomed enterprise and energy of Ameri
cans arc rapidly making it a land where industry and
thrift will be reasonably sure of reward. A variety
of industries are springing up along the Yukon, and
recent reports described the success which has at
tended the manufacture of brick on a large scale for
use in the construction of buildings at Dawson. : All
of* these things imply a permanent settlement of the
country and promise a profitable market for Califor
nia products of nearly all kinds.
REPORTS from Seattle-are >. ito/the- effect that
long before the, day of sailing there was not'a
ticket left for passage on any of the first ves- ;
sels preparing to depart for Nome. It is added in the
dispatch: "Each of the steamship agents has orders
in hand for from 150 to 500 tickets, and could sell as
many mort^if there were any chance of getting a
vessel."'.',.. â¢Â¦; Â¦Â»;-;' ;.-' ; /- : i -'^-^; K:?\/*'. ' Â¦. ; :
Among the passengers there are doubtles$ a great
many unwise 'adventurers,, persons unfitted for the
climate or the work 1 they are going to face,' but these
will n,ot be anything like such proportionate numbers
as in '.the, first wild scramble to get 'to Dawson and
the Klondike. Alaska is no longer an unknown land.
Its. resources 'and its' possibilities are now fairly well
understood, although of course they have been but
superficially explored and can hardly be said to be
developed at all. From the reports that have been
published in the press or sent out through private let
ters the people have derived a knowledge of what to
expect at the different mining camps'; and as a conse
quence it is fair to assume that most of those who are
now going north are reasonably well informed and
have some substantial basis for their hope's of success
when they get there. Â»,

The public punishments of the year 1801
differedmore from those of 1901 than did
the Â¦crimes. 1 ,- Public .whippings for many
crimesr still . were inflicted. Every State,
every town; had whipping posts. Fre
quently these stood in 1 the public streets.
The greatest publicity was given' both to
the . criminal and his .punishment. This
was held to teach a great moral lesson, to
deter young" folk from crime; the visible
token of the result of evil llvlnar was held
to be the best holdback from vice nnd
crimeâ it would frighten people Into being
good. 'Â¦ Â¦Â¦.Â¦ i â¢Â¦Â¦â¢'â¢Â¦- .. â¢,. ...i- v Â¦ Â¦ s. ,

Some Barbarous Practices.
A good deal* of ancient barbarism and
superstition prevailed. It seems Incred
ible that as late aa 1823, In .Baltimore, a
suspected murderer, one under arrest, was
made to go through the "blood ordeal";
that Is. to touch the .corpse of. the mur
dered person, with' a view, to seeing
whether blood would gush from the corpse
at his touch; this being held an Infallible
sign of guilt. â : Â¦ Â«â¢
On October 16, 1660, a law was enacted
in Massachusetts In regard to suicides.
The preamble says It was necessary,
"considering how- far Satan doth prevail
upon persons within' this Jurisdiction to
States sufTer ' long In silence ere . \ they
would resort to divorce. ,' :,y ; ;' V :
Horrors of Prison Life.
"'Â¦ In' general, pYlson life ' was~cruel In^ the
extreme. There was In 1801 In Connecticut
a Newgate which far outdid In horrors the
London prison for which If was named.
An old copper mine af : Slmsbury was
taken In 1773 by wise , Connecticut legis
lators to provide a dungeon* which met all
reasonable requirements as a hell upon
earth, j Two shafts three and one-half feet
In diameter, over seventy feet deep, led to
the cleared spaces or caverns 'which were
to -- serve as sleeping cells. ' One of the
commissioners who secured this n\tne for
a prison was held to be a man of enlight
ened principles, and was three years later
a signer of the Declaration of Independ
ence. Convicts were sent to" this subterra
nean prison from other States. President
Washington sent criminals and political
offenders there. At one time forty tories
were - confined there, among them the
wretched clergyman Samuel Baxter, and
they had a fierce but unsuccessful upris
ing. Revolts were frequent, and prisoners
aeV flre tf> thelr beds, hoping to escape In
thi confusion. In lÂ£02 one keeper, Daniel
Forward, being alone, .was faced by a
gang who refused ' to descend the shaft.
The Intrepid official hurled one convict
after another down the opening until all
were cowed/ In 1806 three brother bur
rlars, working" at nallmaklng In the'fac
tories at the opening of the- shafts, made
keys for all the convicts to unlock their
fetters, but the killing 'of the first man
who tried to eacape brought the revolt to
a speedy close. One clever woman let
down a knotted ropÂ« to her husband, and
between them he managed to escape. In
1815 some buildings were erected overhead
with sleeping cells for women prisoners,
in which four slept in one bunk, two head-
Ing one way,, two the- other; ventilation
and light were i educed to a minimum. In
1827 the prisoners were transferred to the
new Jail at Wothersfleld.
Those wretched convicts were not
starved; each man had a dally ration of a
pound of- beef or three-quarter* of a
pound of pork, a pound of bread, a pintâ
at one time a quartâ of elder, also rum
and? a moderate allowance of potatoes.
Visitors were permitted to coma and gaze
on the Inmate*, who begged and sold
petty i souvenirs | made In their leisure
hour*. For they had leisure; the work
hours for the State were only from 'day*
light to the middle of the afternoon.

It appears, however, that this industrial ' phase of
the question does; not appeal to Morgan, who is on
record as desiring that very thing. The business men
of Alabama, however, may not agree with the poli
ticians upon the benefit of banishing the laboring
population.
Booker Washington has- addressed the convention
in an appeal of great power in behalf of the negro,
reminding Alabama that it should not substitute
oppression for justice in dealing with him, lest it
water the wheel of the numerdus exodus schemes
which, by appealing to the negroes, maj deprive the
State of its wealth-producing black labor population.
The Alabama plan provides a board not to cancel
the ballot, but to wipe out the voter." As. it is pro
posed to permit only white men to hold office, it is
conceivable that the registry , boards with plenary
power may secure the defeat or election of candidates
by rejecting voters white or black.
Senator Morgan adds what seems to us an entirely
unnecessary feature to his plan. It is a county board
of. registry with plenary power to decide who. may
vote and who may not This power might embroil
the whites. The county boards arc to be appointed
"by the Commissioners' Courts, and may admit to
vote or reject whom they please, and are answerable
to no authority for their acts. The Goebcrplan in
Kentucky was to let everybody vote and then throw
out such ballots. as the election boards chose to re*
I ject. It was what is commonly called a deadopenand
i shut, and is believed to have been the means of over
coming a majority of 40,000 cast against Goebel for
i Governor.
The South is between the devil of prejudice against
thenegro and. the deep sea'of deprivation of Repre
sentatives in Congress and votes in the Electoral Col
lege. If the negro is deprived of. the ballot the "free
States may conclude to exercise their /power , to
abridj|: representation based upon the negro popula
tion. But if the negro is permitted to vote, but can
only^vote for white candidates, he will probably
choose not to vote, at all. - He will be deprived of
political aspiration and public ambition, but his legal
right will ' remain unabridged, and therefore repre
sentation and the electoral vote will remain un
changed. â¢
He has communicated with the convention, with the
result of raising its enthusiasm to a high pitch. His
plan is to put in the constitution a section^ making
only white men eligible to office in Alabama. , This
has the merit of exceeding subtlety. Such* a provision
will not be found obnoxious to the Federal constitu
tion, and will ".render unnecessary any .interference*
with the negro ballot. *
rpHE Alabama , constitutional convention . is; e'n-
I 'gaged in exercising its ingenuity upon the "negro
A> suffrage question. It meets for. the sole pur
poBt-of depriving- the negro" oÂ£ the â¢ political pipwer se
cured to him by the fifteenth amendment. "*". 'Senator
Morgan seems to be -relied upon, to lead the. conven
tion to a result that will stand fire in the courts. / *.

An Execution in City Ball Park, New York.
There was much advertising In the press
of recreant and disobedient wives by sad
or angry husbands, these often beginning
with these solemn words printed in ital
ics: "Cursed be he that parteth man and
wife and all the people shall say amen."
Many of these notices of wives having
"left bed and board" Vere followed by
spirited rejoinders from the wife, detailing
the scantiness of board and the husband's
IH-iisnKÂ«\ The husband then "answered
bock" In print, usually blaming his moth
er-in-law. Connecticut papers, according
to my observation*, have more of these
tinhnppy matrimonial advertisements than
have th*Â» papers of other States.' It Is as
serted that divorces were f% more preva
lent In Connecticut than In other States,
but I have not hern able to obtain any
data or proofs which would make me will
ing to confirm this assertion. Divorces
were certainly not frequent in any of the
States and were held In much. disrepute.
The great reserve, the reticence of the
New England nature, would make many

Assessor Washington Dodge has issued
a statement showing' tho chnnges and re
ductions marls in the aMfMment roll for
this year and the reasons for the changes.
The statement in full reuds:
A complete reapprsUcment of the vfcluo u(
each tot Â»n<i of th* Nuilllnjc thereon ha* been
murlc In shout one>half of th* city. Including
thÂ« Mission, llorner'a Addition and the Horn*

owing to lack of aufilclent help. Next year,
however, th" work will probably be completed.

built resr* ago, and which In mnny Instance*
were found to be assessed for *Â¦ much to-day
Â¦s they win when . first erected ten. twenty
and In som* Instsnce* thirty years ago. In
â¢uch case* th* assessment ha* been griraily
reduced. The Mcrea-ste of such reductions on
dwellings amounts to between 13.000,000 an>1
14.000.000 and affect* nl least 10,000 taxpayers
Tn*t building;* hav* J.Â»on unreasonably a*

that rear, they were asÂ«eÂ»aÂ«d at more than
their actual value, and this In spite of. the
fact that land was only assessed that year at
70 per cent of It* actual value. Now, It Is a
well-known fact that a tax on Inn 1 I* borno
by the land owner end cannot b* shifted to
another, but a high tax on rented building*
Is shifted In the Â¦< way of .higher rent* to th*
tenant, the one least able to bear th* tax. A
high tAx on a dwelling occupied as a horn*
by the owner. It being unproductive property
and often th* only property of th* owner. Is
equally objectionable. An- long, however, as
we are compelled - to work under the revenue
system of this Ptate which Is the general
property tax theory, developed to th* lanv dÂ»
gree, w* should so fix value* u not to em

system, a* Is don* when building* ar* as

It has bÂ«en my aim, therefore, since, I hvn
filled the office of Assessor to afford som* re

reduction*. Until, however, sufficient property
escaping taxation had tx>en discovered and

contemplated and afford ark adequate â¢ revenu*

attempt this revision./.. It has, however, been
demanded - for year*, i Those taxpayers â¢ who
have heretofore complained to th* Assessor as
their buildings grew old hnve often b**n
granted relief; thost who .made no complaint
have been penalised for their suhtnlsslon. .
With regard to th* valuation* on - land th*
necessity for revision of values was equally
great. Advancing value* In one part or the
city, with the establishment of new localities
for fashionable quarters, have caured values to

SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE LOOT

McKINLEY.
There were flowers in the garden which
were looked upcÂ» by the President, tnd
they have flown. TherÂ«Â» was a door mat
which had felt the tread of Presidential
feet and detective minds reel at the fear
of its disappearance. There was a door

A relic hunter has neither- bowels nor
conscience: he is all eye and finger, and
the only tools he know? are a jack-knife
and a hammer. He Is Indiscriminate In
his ltkes and dislikes, and he has been
reveling: in the path of the President from
Washington to San Francisco, but in no
place has the field been so prolific as the
Scott house. It Is what Henry T. Scott is
paying for being the Presidential pronoun
for two weeks, but a house, and perhaps
the lot as well, is somewhat of a price to
pay for having loaned the President a
temporary habitation and suffered the in
justice of having been suspected a mo
nopolizing entertainer. So the Chief of
Police has been called Into caucus and
three of his undyed men take turns at
holding down what Is left of where the
President stayed.
AFTER the . sunshine comes the
shadow, and often night and
nothingness, and in the same
way the Scott house on Laguna
street, after being the social and
political center of the country and en
joying the middle of the stage and the
full-powered limelight, is in danger of be
ing lifted piecemeal from the residence
section, for the relic hunters are after It.

The flags of the walk which had . they

Presidential tread are just as good, like an
old master badly faded, as if they did

the police on duty have about counteract

Copt Bin of Detectives Seymour ridicules
the story of a morning paper that two
men wero Implicated In the murder, and
that one of them was n*Â«n to leave the
Hislop house by the rear stairs. Mr. and
Mrs. Hislop are most positive that when
they . returned to their home last Satur
day night and found their son dying the
kitchen door leading to the rear stain
was bolted and that Mrs. Hislop after
ward opened the door to admit a neigh
bor. Â¦
Chief of Detectors Seymour stated res
trrday that the most puzzling fact In con
nection with the murder was that no one
hud come forward to claim the hatchet
found In the vacant-lot opposite the His*
lop house. That the hatchet was, the In
strument used to butcher Robbie Hislop
Is onlv a theory. '
The statement of Mrs. Houston that she
saw a man with a white hat on attempt-
Ing to ehtrr the house at 24 Octavla rtreet
on the night of the murder was shown
yesterday to be true, but It was also
found that the man had nothing to do
with the crime. Tho detectives yesterday
located Morris Dee, who lives at 24 Oc
tavla street, and he Informed th# officers
that he returned home on Saturday night
at the hour mentioned by Mrs. Houston
and that he wore a white hat at the time.'
I Unless the police can discover some Im
portant testimony to link Lukherath with
Ihc murder of Robbie Hislop the suspect
ed man will be set at liberty to-day. .
The detectives are actively engaged on
thÂ» cose, but each clew followed up falls.
That Robbie Hislop was murdered for re-,
venge Is believed. The police decry the
thten* of burglary and robbery.

erate by nature and crazed by reading
dime novels. . '' .i '' ' â¢ - .- .
Kitchen Door Was Bolted.
Lukherath's persistent denials of this
event were upset yesterday when Captain
Seymour sent Detective Ed Gibson to
search the clothes of the murdered lad
in the hope that some clew might be fur
nished. Detective Gibson found in one of
the boy's pockets the identical pard on
which Lukherath's address had been writ
ten when he. with Robbie Hislop, were in
Sclbt's fruit store. . Â¦
Lukherath maintains a stolid demeanor
and said yesterday that he did not re
member a single Incident of being with
Robbie Hislop in the Selbt store on any
occasion. He claimed that he might have
been there, but that if any of the events
occurred as stated by Mrs. Selbt he,
Lukherath. was too intoxicated at tho
time to remember anything.
The suspected' man, however, has ad
mitted that he went to the Hislop house
on the Wednesday night preceding the
murder to see If. there were any letters
for htm. but says he could not get into
the residence.
The theory that Thomas Lope*, who com
mitted suicide in the jail at Redwood
City on Wednesday night, might be the
murderer was exploded yesterday. Lopes
when arrested at Redwood City for Intox
ication raved In hi! cell and declared that
he had been arrested for a murder. Later
on when the officers discovered his life
less body they assumed that Lopes might
have been the murderer of Robbie His
lop, and communicated with Captain of
Detectives Seymour. '
Investigation showed that Lopez was In
h!Â» home at 523 Vallejo street last Satur
day from 3 p. m. until 11:40 p. m.. when
Officer Du&ne was called Into the house
to arrest him. â¢' Yesterday Mrs. Lopez
called on Captain Seymour and stated
th.it her fcusband made a practice of cut
ting out newspaper stories of murders
when In hlÂ» cups. The "blood-stained"
handkerchief found by th* officers of
Redwood City turns Â«out to be nothing
more than a handkerchief marked with
fruit stains. ' .
Card Found in Deaâ¬ Boy's Clothes.
Mrs. Carl Selbt, whose husband keeps t
fruit and candy store at 1944 . Market
street, has stated that Lukherath anc
Robbie Hislop were in the store on thi
Wednesday evening preceding, the mur
der. Mrs. Seibt informed the police thai
Lukherath had purchased some candy foi
the boy and that he tried t to write his ad
dress on a card so that the boy mtghj
bring him any letters that were delivereC
at the Hislop house for him. .
Mrs. Selbt declared that Lukherath wai
too intoxicated to write his name an<!
address on one of her husband's buslnesi
cards, and that she had written the i ad'
dress\ "162 Ninth street," on the card foi
him. â¢
Herman Lukherath,^ the suspect; is still

In the Firet Circuit Court lengthy ar

Privileged Communications.
The Grand Jury has indicted Walter G.
Smith, editor of the Advertiser, for per
jury. It is alleged in the indictment that
be denied knowledge of the name of a cor
poration said to have been approached by
Climbers of the Legislature with solicita
tions for bribes, when. In fact, he knew
the name of th<Â» *aid corporation. Smith
was released on S5000 bail.

parsed by the present Legislature and
f ipned by the Governor providing lor the
selection of Grand Jurors by bailiffs of the
court instead of by the High Sheriff, as
hr-rotcfore. *
Tho Grand Jury is fctill In session and is
very vigorous in its search for evidence

Walter G. Smith Indicted.
Judee Humphreys adjudged Thurston
guilty of contempt, fined him J100 and or
derec him into custody until the end of
the session of the Grand Jury, or until he
answered the question of the jury as to
who was the clit-nt. The arrest created a
profound sensation, as Thurston is a lead
ing citizen of Honolulu. He at once ap
plied to the Supreme Court for a writ of
habr.as corpus and was released on $500
bail
Actir.gr Governor Cocper, Attorney Gen
eral Dole and L. A. Thurston, president of
the Gazette Publishing Company, were
summoned to appear before Judge
Humphreys and -how cause why they
shouid not tell the "Grand Jury what they
had heard regardlr.R bribery in the Legis
lature. The arguments in the case were
by Attorney General Dole on one side and
Tom Fitch, the well-known American or
ator, on the other, and the case aroused
much interest. Judge Humphreys sus
tained Dole, as it \v;u shown that he had
tnld the Grand Jury the names of the
men from whom he had received evidence.
Thurston had told the Jury that he beard
that legislators had approached a cor
poration with solicitations of bribes, but
he declined to give the name of the cor
poration on the ground that as attorney
he had a right to withhold It as'given in
confidence by a client to an attorney.
Thurston Guilty of Contempt.
The jury began its Investigations on a
letter from the Governor to the Legis
lature, refuslnp to extend the ses.sion be
cause he had information that bribers'
was taking place. AH of the Government
offici&ls were called. Governor Dole ap
peared before the Jury and. it is said, told
all that he knew. He was on the eve of
his departure to a resort In the Waianae
Mountains, as he had been ordered by his
physician to drop business matters and
take a vacation. Tiie other heads of de
partments. Attorncv General Dole. Secre
tary of the Territory Cooper. Superintend
ent of Public Works MeCandless and
Treasurer Lansing, were summoned to
testify, and each refused to tell what he
knew, on the ground that the information
received was in the nature of a "privi
leged communication." having been given
to them as Government officials. It is
stated that the evidence in question was
discussed in a council consisting of the
Governor and the heads of departments.
HONOLULU. May 23.-The spec!*!

Do Hair No Good, bat Often Causa
It to Fall Out
Many hair preparations are "fake" be-
caufe tbey are merely scalp Irritants.
They often cause a dryness, making the
hair brittle, and. finally, lifeless. Dandruff
!s the cause of all trouble with hair. It is
a rerrn disease.. The germ makes cuticle
f.-iW aj> it dies to the root of the hair,
where It dfstroys the hair's vitality, caus-
ing the hair to fall out. To cure dan-
druff, the germ roust be killed. "Destroy
the rouse, you remove the effect." New-
bro't Herpiddc is the only hair prepara-
tion that kill* the dandruff germ, thereby
leaving- the hair to- grow luxuriantly.

School days are danger days for American girls.
Often physical collapse follows, and it takes years to re-'
cover the lost vitality. Sometimes it is never recovered.
'Â¦Â¦Â¦;Â¦'Â¦ Perhaps she is not over-careful about keeping her feet i
dry; through carelessness in this respect the ; monthly -sick-
ness is usually rendered very severe.
Then begin ailments which should be removed at once, |
or they will produce constant suffering. Headache, faint- i
ness, slight vertigo, pains in the back and loins, irregularity,
loss of sleep and appetite, a tendency to avoid the society of
others are symptoms all indicating that woman's arch-enemy
is at hand.
This need not be so if mothers would have a thought for
thp physical condition of their daughters, and. see to it that
.they have proper assistance. ~c

WASHINGTON. May 80.â The board on
awards is still giving consideration to the
dealgn of a jnedalto adopt for the officers
aud Â¦.men who took part ; in" the battle of
Santiago. This much Is certain, the medal
will not bÂ«nr the profile of Rear Admiral
Sampson as the. Manila medal bears the
pronto oiA Admiral Dewey. Such action
would. It w feared, revive the Earapson-
Schley controversy. A _. ,
The adherents of Hear Admiral Schley.
however, will probably find fault with a
suggestion of Rear Admiral Sampson's
supporters that tho medal to be given to
the latter officer bÂ« inscribed. "Rear Ad
miral William T. Sampson. Commander
In Chief." while that of the other of
ficer bear the Inscription, ."Rear Admiral
W. 8. Schley, Commanding Second Squad
ron. North Atlantic Fleet." Those who
advocate this nuggestion point out that
It is strictly correct, while Rear Admiral
Schley 1 b friends Insist that It doea not
give that officer tho credit which is his
due. The board has not yet decided upon
the Inscriptions to be placed upon the
medals. to be awarded to the two senior
officers. . Â¦

' Genera' B. Ruiz, who fled from ' Nicar
agua, some - years ago, returned to his
home on one of the Central American
ete&xnehins last month. As soon as he set
foot on Nicaraguan soil he was arrested
for some criminal acl committed long ago.
He wae Jn Jail, with the prospects of a
speedy trial when the Sydney left.
The City of Sydney brings the news that
President Zelaya of Nicaraguan will prob
ably visit the Pan-American Congress at
Buffalo. He is to leave home next month
and should reach San Francisco about
Jur.6 IS.
When the City of Sydney was at Co
rlnto the people were expecting an Inva
sion from Colombo. Th<5 Government of
Nicaragua, in order to make sure that It
would not be caught napping, has rta
tioned 500 men at Corinto.
&â¢: Salvador Is to have a man-of-war.
The Government has purchased from her
British owners the steamship Soy and will
transform her Into a cruiser, renaming her
Saivador. The new warship is now at
Acajutia and will go Into commission at
one*. She Is COO ton* net burden. Ztt feet
long. S4 feet beam and 13 feet deep. Her
speed is plven as 15 knots.
The men on the Sydney say the Ore was
under control when 'they left, but coal
handlers here don't believe them. General
Agent Pearne and his men were trying- 10
drown out the flre with salt water and
have; in consequence, caked the outside
of the mass, while the Ineide Is mclte*!.
The TWO tons were easily worth J73JÂ»0 and
It is very doubtful whether any of It will
be saved. The company's boats win now
rave to carry coal for the round trjp until
a frf sh supply can be sent to Panama on
a collier.
Nearly all the coal came from New
castle, Australia, and some of It was Irotn
mines which loaded vessels that arrived
here with either their cargoes hcatcÂ«l or
on fire. This stuff in the pile en Naos Ig
nited from spontaneous combustion and
won the whole mass was ln flames. Hun
dreds of men were put to work by General
Agen; Pearne of the Mall Company, but
they could not drown out the fire. They
were still at work wben the City of Syd
ney and Leelanaw left Panama, and the
fire had then* been burning fifteen days.
Th<Â» steamship City of Sydney, which ar
r:vÂ»d from Panama and way ports yes
terday, fcring-s the news of a heavy loss
fustainc-d b> the Pcciflc Mall Company.
For years the Island of Naos, In the Bay
cf Panama, has been used by the com
pany, sjb a oca! yard. All of Its steamships
rilled their bunkers from the supply, and
on April CO last 7500 tons of fuel was still

One cuestion to which much attention
will be given is as to the extent of pow
ers conferred on the President by the
Spooner amendments to the army appro
priation bill, which provides that "all mil
itary, civil and judicial powers necessary
to govern Ihe Philippine islands shall, un
til otherwise provided by Conrrcss, be
vested in such person or persons and
Khali be exercised In such manner as the
President shall direct/' There is no doubt
among officials that this empowers the
President or the Philippines Commission,
acting under hin authority, to promulgate
a tariff law which will have . the same
It- gal force as the Foraker act as to Porto
Rico Just declared constitutional.
"We will keep right on sawing wood

Dole has .become unpopular with the
natives and the Independent Republicans,
and a movement was started to unseat
him. He Is suffering from a threatened
attack of paresis, according to rumor,
and is unable to fulfill the duties of the
office. Estee, who is Federal Judge of
Hawaii, has gained a great measure of
popularity and a large percentage of the
people favor making him Governor.
w Wi!cox sits next to Representative)
Wocda in the House of Representatives,
and Woods is reported to have consider
able influence with him. At any rate.
Wilcox and Beckley went directly to>
Woods* office upon their arrival and re
quested him to accompany them to thÂ«
President, who was then in the metrop
olis. He did so, and all three had an in
terview with the chief executive, who
has the appointment of the Governor of
Hawaii. ,
Although the object of calling upon Me-
Klnley was to gain the good will of the
administration in favor of Estee. the mat
ter was handled delicately, the Repre
sentatives merely reporting the condition
or affairs at Hawaii and the sentiment oC
a large number of the people there.
"Did Mr. McKlnley express himself as
against Dole?" asked a reporter who In
terviewed Congressman Wood.-* to-day
"Why, no: he would not hit a sick
man," was the reply. "He advised-Beck
ley to return to Hawaii and come back
after the Legislature had adjourned.
w . h i n w. he would have another msetlng
with him In Washington. He asked him
to advise the Legislature to pass laws
for the betterment of conditions down
there and to do all possible in the way
of having the country get into closer
touch with the United States." "
STOCKTON. May 30.- That the active
Hawaiians are working for the political
undoing of Governor Dole is made evident
by a story published here to-day evident
ly upon pointers given by Congressman
Woods to the paper. According to the re
port:
Robert Wilcox, Delegate * from Hawaii
to Congress, and Frederick Beckley of the
Hawaiian House of Representatives, ar
rived in San Francisco recently and went
to the law ofiice of Congressman 8. D.
Wocds. They explained to the Congress
man the situation of affairs in Hawaii,
which, briefly stated, they represented to
be as follows:
Judge Estee is Spoken of as
the Possible Chief â¢
Executive.

between the several electric railway com
panies of this city and. their" â¢ employes
xave been satisfactorily adjusted so far
as the Las Angeles Railway Company is
concerned - by the adoption of a - wage
schedule of 20 cents an hour for men who
have been with. the company for less than
three years, fil rents an hour for the neit
two years and 22 cents for five years' ser
vice. . It Is believed 'the other companies
will adopt the same, schedule, which is
said. to be satisfactory to the men.

attempted to turn the boat, which was
then about fifty feet from the dam and
twenty-live feet from the shore, but ho I
turned the wrong way. * . :

Â¦ If the charter can render a Police Com
missioner ineligible for one year, aftsr his
term expires it con render him ineligible
forever. Its force in this respect is doubt
ful, but nevertheless Mr. Newhall is rlrra
in his purpose to keep out of the contest,
declaring that he would not accept a nom
ination even If the charter provision did
not exist. He says*-. "I do not want the
place and vould not. take It. that la cer
tain. I am ready to work for the pub:ic,
but not in that line.. There are others
who are older and better qualified tor the
position than I am." . Â¦

Mayor Phelan Is not mentioned as an
aspirant for gubernatorial honor. 1 1 His
political frlenas Incline to the belief that
he will run again for Mayor, hoping to
win through Republican credulity and
Democratic stupidity. ;
George A. Newhail. Republican, wishes
to have It denied that . he â¢ is a candidate
for Mayor. He fancies that he is ineligi
ble under section 31 (miscellaneous) of tne
new charter, which is as follows:
Mr. Lane was a generous giver In aid of
Bryan and the Sllverites. He gained many
admiring friends by his liberality in lKlb.
Since then his store of worldly wealth has
been largely augmented, although at that
time he was a multi-millionaire. No won
der, then that I*ana Is the long-looked -ror
Moecs of the California Democracy.
Lane a Generous Giver.
The Democrats talk of reorganizing all
along tho line for the battle to beat the
Republican nominee for Governor next
year. Already they boast: of their ability
to win. ThÂ«s hopeful of the party are look
ing tor a. Moses. Mayor ttnyaer of Los
Angeles is not entirely * acceptable. As
sessor Washington Dodge -does not pos
sess all the Motses-llko attribute* desired
by tho rank and liie. Hagaclous states
men who have â¢ been vigorously beating
the bulrushes whisper onÂ« to another thai
Charles D. Lane Is the real ana true
Moses to lead the Democratic column to
success. Word Is given i to the faithful
that . Lane vvijl accept ! the ! leadership -and
contribute sinews of strength to cheer the
mobt despondent. . â¢ V .
The political : prophets are predicting a
light vote At the August primary election
for delegates to the municipal nominating
conventions. Reasons are advanced for
the prediction. It is claimed that politics
Is the occupation of idlers, and < as the
Idlers are few and far between In this era
of prosperity and active business the citi
zens will -not -take the time to discuss, af
fairs of local government \ oÂ» participate
In a contest for selection of delegates to
a conventldn. Furthermore,* it Is claimed
that the . State election of 1803 for Gover
nor, members of the Legislature and prac
tically,, for United States Senator is al
ready engaging quite as much attention
as that accorded. to the local event of this
year.. As the law now stands' San Fran
cisco is blessed or vexed, as the case may
be, with ! an election , every;, year. This
year a Mayor Is to be chosen, . next year
a Governor..- In 1903 another charter elec
tion J occurs, and , in the year following
comes the Presidential contest. All sea
sons are given to politics. ' \ ,

The election of grand officers will engage
a good deal, of. the time and attention of
