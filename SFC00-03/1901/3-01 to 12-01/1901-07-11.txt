The inountaln, -which is one of the last
ramifications of the Alps, rises In a pyra
midal mass to the height of 6230 feet and
gives a superb view of the panorama of
the Rhone. The use of this high and iso
lated summit, was proposed by the Mete
orological Commission of the Department
of Vaucluse in 1S79, and national and local
subscriptions were solicited for the erec
tion of a building which should benefit
meteorology, including weather and flood
predictions. It was necessary to first con
struct a road twelve miles long to unite
the summit of the mountain with the
thoroughfare beiow. In 1S83 the observa
tory was opened . (or meteorological work.
There is a main building 100x35 feet, which
is sunk In the north slope of the summit,
having its principal facade to the south.

VENERABLE, revered for his no

for his achievements in the realm
of pure science. Dr. H. W. Hark
ness went peacefully to his long
rest in the gray dawn of yesterday morn
ing. His death occurred in his apart
ments at the Pacific-Union " Club, where
he had been confined to his bed since
early in June.
The aged scientist's eightieth birthday.
May 25, was an occasion of celebration
among his most intimate friends. With
in a week afterward the feebleness of old
age compelled him to take to bed, and he
failed steadily from that time until death
ensued.
F. J. Harkness of Skofleld. Utah, a
r.ephew and the only surviving near re
lative, was with Dr. Harkness during his
last moments. IJfelong friends did all
that was possible during the venerable
physician's last illness to add to his com
fort and happiness.
Dr. Harkness was one of the most emi
nent scientists of which California has been
able to boast, and in his chosen specialty.
In botany, the lower cryptogams, he -was
for many years an authority. His name
has been closely associated with the Cali
fornia Academy of Sciences for more
than a quarter of a century, and a very
considerable portion of the success of that
institution has been due to his unselfish
devotion to the cause of science.

Scientific Bent in Youth-
Karvey Wilson Harkness was born May
25. 1E21. at Pelham. Mass. His parents
were of Scottish birth. As the seventh
child of a large family in comparatively
humble circumstances his educatjonal op
portunities were limited, but he early dis
played a. fondness for study and perse
verance in the pursuit of knowledge. Â¦ He
turned his attention to the study of medi
cine and In 1817 was graduated from the
Berkshire Medical College:
The young physician joined a party of
emigrants at Rock Island, Illinois, and
Journeyed across the plains to California.
They met Â¦with many hardships but finally
crossed the Sierras Into the land of gold

Inestimable Service to Science.
Dr. Harkness' researches during his
first years of residence in San Francisco
began, to attract attention. In 1S75 he be
came connected with the Academy of Sci
ences and the study of fungi became his
hobby. His devotion to science and his
unremitting efforts to advance the Inter
ests of the Academy, were recognized Â¦ in
18S7 by his election as president of that
scientific body. He served in that-capa
city until 1896. when he withdrew and
was succeeded by Dr. David Starr Jor

When the first transcontinental railroad
was completed Dr. Harkness presented on
behalf of the State of California the gold
6pikes which were driven by Leland
Stanford, May 10, 1S69. On May 17 of the
same year Dr. Harkness was present as
the invited guest o'f the Viceroy of Egypt
at the opening of the Suez Canal.
Dr. Harkness removed to San Francisco
In 1869 and resided here continuously from
that time until his death. He was a great
traveler, and made many trips to Europe
and to the Eastern cities and two visits
to North Africa. ; " v J^V"

profession there. A year later he had
come to realize the larger opportunities
that were offered at Sacramento and he
removed to that bustling mining camp.
He met with a high degree of success, be

of the State. He amassed a considerable
fortune and in 1S69 he retired permanent
ly from the practice' of medicine and
thenceforth devoted himself to scientific
research and the furtherance of the work
and interests of scientific societies.
Dr.\ Harkness' scientific research was
in the field of the lower cryptogamsâ
chiefly a study of the fungi of the Pacific
'Coast. He was the author, of a large
number of bulletins and monographs pub
lished by the Academy of Sciences, 'and
was a frequent contributor 'to scientific
journals. His collection of cryptogams,
containing 10,000 specimens, than which
none finer exists in any museum, was pre

Sweeney Again a Candidate.
The Call understands that C. H. Ga
routte is in ths field as a candidate for
Chief Justice to succeed W. H. Beatty.
Judge Edward Sweeney of Shasta County,
Who was backed by railroad influences in
the 'State Convention of 189S for nomina
tion for Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court, is eaid to be in the field again as a
candidate. W. F. Herrin and J. B. Wright,
who advocated Judge Sweeney's nomina
tion in 1S98, did not press his candidacy
with all < the power at their command,
deeming- excessive" pressure at that time
inadvisable. W. F. Herrin has knowledge
of the political scheme recently devised to
bring about .the nomination of Judge
Sweeney in the next Republican State'
Convention. He expects that delegations

Local 3Torecast^.Offlcial Says That
Scientific Plant Should \ Be the
Best in the World.
Secretary Wilson of the Department of
Agriculture has expressed his approval of
the ; plan, long entertained i by Alexander
McAdie, local forecast official of the
Weather Bureau In SanFrancIsco, for. the
establishment of a high class station,' ob
servatory and . laboratory on the summit
of Tamalpais Mountain. He has also re
quested Forecaster McAdie to prepare
estimates for the cost, which Is roughly
fixed at about < $200,000. ..' The -Department
of Agriculture has not the funds, so. Mc-
Adie says, to establish the proposed scien
tlflcjplant at this time. V; He Is preparing
the estimates- as. requested. He thinks
that there are wealthy men In the country
who could well afford to build for them
selves this striking scientific^ monument to
their memory, on- the,, towering peak of
old ' Tamalpals. The Interest that Sec
retary Wilson Â¦. has manifested is signifi
cant. If it should lead to results in the
near future It would mean that the fore
casting for this region ? would be per
formed at the summit and not In San
Francisco. . ,
It would also bring about an extension
of the study of meteorological phenomena
on a wider scale than has been possible.
Forecaster McAdie* thinks that the ob
servatory and laboratory should be, the
best and most complete in the world.
! When the Presidential party was in San
Francisco Secretary 'Wilson had several
conversations with- McAdie on the sub
ject of the observatory on Mount Tamal
pias. â¢ * ;
_ -Weather Breeding Topography.
The Secretary, stood on the summit of
Mount .Tamalpals and viewed the won
derful topography* of the country about
the ' bayjofy- Sao . -^i'anoisco, ~ the A Golden
Gate, the mountain ranges on both 6ldes
of tho bay and the valleys "that, are re
vealed from the mountain top and he was
greatly interested. To the west was the
broad expanse of the Pacific ' Ocean,
over which sweep the storms, that strike
the Pacific Coast as their initial point of
visitation in the territory of the United
States on their journeys eastward. North,
south and east, for many leagues, until
the view was bounded by the horizon, ex
tended, the fair land of California, with
vast agricultural interests to be benefited
by prompt knowledge of the meteorologi
cal disturbances from the sea. Almost at
his feet, as it appeared, was the city of
San Francisco, which manifest destiny
has selected to be one of the great com
mercial ports of the world. . He realized
that the summit of Tamalpais was favor
ably situated for the study of the
meteorological phenomena of the levels
from 1500 to 4000 feet and that It was feas
ible there to study frost, formations of
fog and other phenomena, which, in their
final application,- are of great practical
concern to mankind. What will come of
the matter is yet uncertain. Forecaster
McAdie insists that the department Is not
prepared to take action. There are
others who believe that the Secretary has
not Invited the preparation of estimates
out of mere idleness and curiosity.
Four Buildings Required.
To make up the complete plant required,
will, in McAdie's ppinion, require one cen
tral building and three other structures.
The central building would be the seat of
weather observations for this region. The
fitness of Mount Tamalpais for meteoro
logical observation has already, been de
termined by the small station placed on
the mountain some years ago at the in
stance of the forecaster. In two of the
other buildings there would be instru
ments, etc., for spectroscopic, optical and
electrical work. There would be uses
not defined for the third building.
"The problem before us," said the.
weather forecaster, j "Is the successful
scientific forecasting of atmospheric con
ditions. In no other direction would the
work of the aero-physical laboratory be
so Â¦ pronounced. Carried from short pe
riods-to periods of weeks and months,
what 'branch of applied will be
found to exercise so great an influence
upon the r welfare of man? There is a
popular 'impression that forecasting
weather i conditions is, in high degree, a
matter of scientific procedure. . Much that
is scientific- in character has been done,"
but, without disparaging such work, the
present condition of our. knowledge Is
quite ; unsatisfactory. The direction in
which the demand, for^immediate appli
cation of our knowledge of aero-physics is
greatest Is in. connection with the tides
and fluxes of that aerial ocean in which
we live, the storms and currents of the
atmosphere.' We know almost nothing of
the electrification of the atmoaphet e.
How, the air receives its charge .we Tlo
not know and of the distribution of the
potential and the significance of its varia
tions we have only fragmentary and scant
knowledge." ' 'Â¦â¢- * Â¦- h -' -

Ellace between Machododorp and .Lyden

least fifty. killed. > '
Many offers of aid were made to the
young Boer as soon as the numerous
sympathizers with the cause he represents
learned of his arrival. The immigration
authorities had detained him, because un
der the law they are supposSed to collect
a fine of $10 -for every stowaway brought
into this port. It was also necessory for
the Commissioner of Immigration to be
assured that Du Plooy would not become
a public charge.
The Board of Special Inquiry asked Du
Plooy questions about his character and
his health, and decided that the .Boer
was a qualified immigrant .provided the
$10 fine were paid and a bond given that he
would not become' a public charge. Mr.
Schramm paid the fine and gave the bond
and the Boer was. then officially pronouncad
to ; be a proper person to land on American
soil." Du Plooy was loudly cheered by the
immigrants aa- he left Ellis. Island. He
said: r; â¢*â¢â¢<Â¦Â¦ > t

OMAHA, Nebr., July 10.â The South
Omaha Fair to-day celebrated Governor's
day, and a special bullfight was provided
for the executive's entertainment. A half
dozen animals were Introduced, but each
was listless in the intense heat and the
show was tame. One huge animal sought
shelter in a shady spot and the perform
ers prodded it' with their blunt lances In
vain.
The exhibition was followed by wild
bronco breaking, which was much more
acceptable in the Governor's sight, the ex
ecutive being himself a frontiersman.
Previous to the bullfight there ocurred
an elaborate parade through the avenues
cf the fair, companies of the Tenth In
fantry and various militia organizations
participating. Governor Savage was at
tended by his staff in full regalia. . . ;
In a published interview to-day Gover
nor Savage indorsed the sport of bull
fighting, providing the animal itself es
caped harm. He was told that so far no
bull's blood had been shed and replied:
"That's good. So long as the bull is not
badly treated there is no ground for in
tervention. The performers go into the
arena with a : full knowledge of the risk
involved, and if they are hurt it Is their
own lookout." '
I The bullfights will take place daily dur

COLUMBUS. O.. July 10.â The Demo
cratic State Convention here to-day had
'more prominent men as delegates than
any convention of Democrats in Ohio for
many years. It was otherwise distin
guished.
The nomination of Colonel Kilbourne
was appropriately called one of "spon
taneous combustion." Howell, Hidy, Al
shire and Holman were favorites at great
odds frcm the start. Young was sprung
as a surprise and nominated over Smoots,
who had been such a favorite that others
would not previously enter the race for
Clerk of the Supreme Court. None of the
delegates outside of Cleveland knew
Young, and he was nominated because
Cuyahoga wanted him. Cuyahoga could
get anything it wanted, except the head
of the State ticket, after the Johnson
amendments were ingrafted into the Mc-
Lean platform, and that document as
amended was adopted with equanimity.
Defeat of Monnett.
It was currently reported that Johnson
desired the nomination of Monnett as At
torney General, and the McLean men
wanted ilonnett defeated. At any rate,
the defeat of Monnett was so decisive as
to be a feature of the convention, and he
was not defeated by Mykrantz, who had
been the favorite, but by McCarthy, who
was being called an "also ran" on the
floor of the convention until one of the
Monnett men circulated the report that
McCarthy was an attorney for the Stan
dard Oil Company. When the reaction
came on this charge. Mykrantz withdrew
during the ballot, in favor of McCarthy,
and the latter-got two-thirds of the votes.
Monnett as Attorney General had
brought suits against the Standard Oil
Company and other corporations to cancel
their charters under the anti-trust law.
He had sought a third term nomination
from the Republicans on the issue that

Eupported Bryan in 1900 on the anti-trust
issue and cam'assed Ohio and other State*
with Brjran. Jud^e Smalley In present
ing Monaett's name said he was known
from the Golden Gate, San Francisco, to
the Heir Gate, Xew York, as the enemy
of trusts.
Bryan ? s Picture Is Trampled.
In the alleged -stampede "for principles
rather than men" the most striking turn
of the convention was on Bryan. The
most bitter things were said on his leader
ship this morning when It was said that
his name should not be mentioned, and
that there should be no reference to cither
of the national platforms on which he
made his campaigns. After this plan had
been agreed on one of the twenty-one
members of that committee offered a
minority report reaffirming the Kansas
City platform and expressing confidence
in Bryan, and he received only six votes
out of 950 delegates on his substitute for
the platform preamble. A few moments
after the platform was adopted one of
these six delegates called attention to the
fact that pictures of other Democrats
were displayed in the hall and none of
Bryan, as heretofore. He started, to carry
a small banner with Bryan's picture on it
to the platform. The aisles were ordered
cleared and the picture did not reach its
destination. It was trampled under foot
and spoiled during the wild demonstration
when Kilbourne was escorted into the
hall. Members of the committee on reso
lutions say that over one hour was spent
after last midnight in efforts to strike the
word "salable" out of the plank on rail
way taxation, and several hours in de
nouncing the Chicago and Kansas C'ty
platforms and the leader who stood- on
them. The platform caused much com
ment to-night over what it does not tay
as well as what it does say.
Platform on Old Principles.
Most interesting of the routine proceed
ings was the platform. Hon. M A
Dougherty reported the following resolu
tions, which were adopted: Â¦ -
The Democrats of Ohio reaffirm their belief
In the equality of taxation and other public
burden*: their advocacy of the equal rights
of all people, with special privileges to none
their hostility to the monopolization of In
dustry, with tendency on the one hand to
crush out individual enterprise and on the
other to promote a. *ociaIiFtic eplrlt among the
jveople as the only refuge from oppression; and
their faith in that theory and practice of con
stitutional government which brought the na
tion into existence, and have preserved It to
the present generation. With these objects the
I>emoci"atic party of Ohio makes the following
declaration of principles and policies:
CINCINNATI, July 10.â The twentieth
international convention of Christian En
deavorers came to a close to-day.. Audi
toriums Endeavor and Williston were
used for two big rallies in the morning
devoted to a discussion of the twentieth
anniversary session of the society. Secre
tary John Willis Baer of Boston presided
In Auditorium Endeavor. George W. Cole
man of Boston described the Christian
Endeavor work among soldiers and sail
ors. He said that two went down with the
Maine in Havana harbor and that twelve
more sailed with Dewey and the Olympia
into Manila. Bay. The Rev. George W.
Moore of Nashville, Tenn., told of the
work among the Afro-Americans, and
Frederick A. Wallace of Lexington, Ky.,
described the prison work of the Endeav
orers. The Rev. J. F. Cowan" of Boston
dwelt on the work among the foreigners
in this country. - -
Bishop B. W. Arnett' of Wilberforce,
Ohio, presided at the meeting at Audito
rium Williston. "What the Church Has
Gained"-- was the- subject -treated -by -the
Rev. G. W. Butler of Washington, D. C.
The Rev. Harlan L. Freeman of Sheridan
ville, Pa., spoke of the inter-denomina
tional fellowship of the society. The Rev.
W. S.' Ament of j. eking. China, spoke on
"International and Interracial Fellow-
Ship," President Clark on "The World's
phrfstian Endeavor Union" and the Rev.
George H. Hubbard of China on "China's
Greeting to the Intermediate Society."
: The afternoon rallies were given over to
the missionaries foe a discussion of their
needs.: President Clark presided at the
meeting In Auditorium Endeavor. Robert
E. Speer of New York, a member of the
Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions,
made an appeal to Christians to carry out
the injunction of the Savior to teach the
gospel, in all lands. The Rev. Willis P.
Hotchkiss of East Coast/ Africa, told. a
thrilling story of the establishment of his
mission in the African jungles.
The evils of opium and liquor In mis
sionary fields were given a- scoring. The
Rev. G. L. Wharton of Hiram, Ohio, a
missionary, said that they were the great
est evils in the missionary fields, because
the cheapest, strongest and most madden
ing kinds, of. liquors were used by the
masses of- heathen. The Rev. J. P. Jones
of India stated that for many centuries
India was a sober nation, till the coming
of the Anglo-Saxon with his drinks, and
that to-day drunkenness was regarded by
manj' as a mark of distinction. If Eng
land should evacuate India â¢ to-day, he
said, the greatest evidence of her occu
pancy would be the number of empty
whisky bottles. Edward Holten of India
corroborated these statements.
Uncle Sam's Indem
nity Claim.
Turkey's Ruler Settled
Women predominated in the big rally In
Auditorium Williston In the afternoon,
which was presided over by Bishop Alex
ander Walters of New Jersey. Samuel B.
Capen of Boston warned his hearers to
beware of Russia, which, he said, was
holding down the Christian Endeavorers
in Russian territory.
SULTAN PAYS
THE THOUSANDS
"WASHINGTON, July 10.â The State De
partment has received the amount of the
An.erican indemnity for the claim against
Turkey, $95,000, through the American le
gation at Constantinople.
The money was paid by the Turkish
Government to Mr. Leishman, our Minis
ter at Constantinople, and was by him
placed in the Ottoman Imperial Bank and
drafts remitted for the amount. These
drafts have just reached Washington. As
is always the case, the claims in the ag
gregate considerably exceed the amount
of the indemnity actually paid, but our
Government has expressed itself satisfied
with the payment. It assumes full respon
sibility for the distribution, the Turkish
Government paying down aÂ«lump sum of
$95,000, and leaving It to the State Depart
ment to distribute it among the claim
ants at its discretion and after its own
fashion. It is stated that , as soon as the
department officials can prepare their list
it will communicate directly with the
claimants. . .
These claims are principally based on
losses suffered by the American mission
ary and educational institutions in Tur
key,, notably those at Harpoot and Ma
rash, but there are a number of Individ
ual claims, such, for instance, as that of
the family of the unfortunate cyclist
Lenz, the Pittsburg man who was killed
by Turkish soldiers while attempting to
go around the globe on his wheel.
â¢ The State Department officials feel the
greatest satisfaction at the settlement of
these claims. Secretary Hay has been
told by diplomats skilled in the ways of
Oriental diplomacy and experienced in the
political conditions of Southern Europe
that he never would be able to collect
them. Among other difficulties the State
Department had to contend with was the
jealousy of the great European powers,
mest of whom had claims .against Tur
key vastly larger In amount than ours,
and whose total was beyond the ability
of the Turkish Government to meet. For
more than a decade the American claims
have been pending. .
Reception to Oarsmen.
DUBLIN, July 10.â The members of the
crew of the University of Pennsylvania,
on arrival at Killarney, met. with an en
thusiastic reception. , The Urban Council
presented to them an address of welcome.
To-day the crew practiced on the lower
lake. Â¦ *

McAn-na assumed the throttle himself on
leaving Marshall and was running the
engine when the collision occurred. The
trains met two miles west of Norton on
a curve surmounting: a hieh embankment.
A relief train started from Kansas
City at noon and returned here with the
injured at 6 o'clock this evening. Those
who died en route were taken to an un
dertaker's, while -the others were dis
tributed between two hospitals. The six
killed outright were left at Slater, Mo. '
The trains collided while going at a good
rate of speed. The engines were pushed
to either side of the track and practically
demolished, while the forward cars of the
passenger train telescoped each other..
The forward Pullman and the tourist
sleeper in front were burned. The bag
gage car was wrecked and freight' cars

.The train which was wrecked was one
of the finest passenger trains in the

Eight of Labor to Combine.
No question of the right of labor to combine
for the assertion of its rights and" for the pro
tection of its Interests. The burdens of the un
just and discriminating laws for which- the
Republican party is responsible-- fall chlefl>
on those who till the soil or labor at other
forms of production. The Democratic party
pledges Its efforts to relieve them, of the bur
dens which class legislation has. laid on thjm.
That the Republican party has. always up
held class interests and". is Justly chargeable
with hostility In both belief and practice to
the above principles is common, knowledge. Â¦
It cannot be trusted to deal -with evils of
Its own creation. The arrogant assumption
by that party of all credit for -everything and
the threats of those who speak- for it and' Its
favored interests, already too;/: powerful to
cr*ate .artificial conditions of stringency and
distress, unless the . policies, they advocate are
supported at the polls, deserve. the condemna
tion of a people who a're 'Just and ' propose to
remain free. - -'-~"'?~J-"^. '<.' ' * â¢ '" , "'â¢ ;Â»-â¢â¢"_>/'

Only territorial expansion' demanded ' by the
national welfare and the national safety tabc
at any time favoredr-the objection which should
have prevented " certain of- our recent occupa
tions being that, they imperil the national
safety without promotion of the national wel
fare; that they devolve upon ua enormous re
sponsibilities-we have no call to- assume; that
they are certain to be an unremunerative drain
upon our resources; that , they . tend to embroil
us with European powers;' that they weaken our
claim to supremacy. on. the American continent,
at the same .time that they lessen our ability
to make the claim good,* and that they furnish
a dangerous opportunity and temptation for the
disregard, of "the -self-evidenÂ£ truth of uni
versal application that governments derive their-
Juet powers from the consent of the governed."
The obvious sympathy of the' national admin
istration with ;the British Government In Its
efforts to destroy the South African republic*
and the policy which has made the ports of
the United States a basis of supply for the
British army, without which the war could not
be successfully carried on, are -condemned by
the Democracy of Ohio.. . ;.;.';
The powers granted the Federal 'Government
were not meant to be used to conquer or hold
in subjection the people of other countries.
The Democratic" party "has never" favdred and
now opposes any extension of the national
boundaries not meant to carry speedily to all
inhabitants full equal rights with ourselves. If
these are unfitted by location, race or charac
ter to be formed into self -governing territory

Opposes Boundary Extension.
Our merchant marine to be restored to its
former greatness and made the ally of the peo
ple against monopoly by the repeal of antl
quate and restricted navigation laws. No sub
sidies for favored shipowners.
Tariff reform was never more urgently de
manded than now. when th*e existence and
abuses of trusts have been brought about by
the policy of protection of favored industries.
The abolition ,of the so-called protective sys
tem and the substitution in Its place of the
traditional Democratic policy of a tariff for
revenue so levied as not to burden one indus
try for the benefit of another is demanded.
The enactment and the vigorous enforcement
of measures which shall prevent all monopolies
and combinations in restraint of trade and com
merce â the matter of first importance being: to
prevent the use of the Government as an in
strumentality for the creation and increase of
the wealth of the few. while preserving intact
the rlgrht of private property and the fullest
measure of individual liberty of contract and
assuring to every man the Just reward of su
perior industry and skill. We demand the sup
pression of all trusts and a return to industrial
freedom. As a means to that end all trust
products should be placed on the freÂ«S list and
the Government should exercise a more -rigid
supervision of transportation lines and abolish
In fact all unjust discrimination in rates.
The reserved rights of the State and people
to be upheld. Centralization, which would de
stroy them, to be condemned. A strict con
struction of the constitution. The greatest in
dividual liberty consistent with public order
and welfare.
The present Republican administration, in
the conduct of public affairs and in the man
agement of public institutions, has been the
most costly in the history of the State.
Benevolent and penal institutions should be
conducted upon a non-partisan and business
basis..
Tariff Reform Demanded.
The proceedings of the Republican majority
of the State Board of Equalization are a scan
dal. Property values, instead of being equal
ized, were increased or diminished at the dic
tation of political bosses, pursuant to corrupt
combinations and conspiracies. . , .
Steam and electric railways and other cor
porations possessing public franchises shall be
assessed in the, same proportion to their sal
able value as are farm and city real estate.
The Acceptance of free passes or other favors
from railroads by public officers or employes
shall be made adequate ground for vacating
the offices held by them.
The government of municipalities of the
State should be radically reformed' and wise
general laws be- enacted to correct abuses and
prevent their recurrence. - ',
The Democratic party, therefore, calls upon
the people to unite with it in placing the con
duct of municipal affairs upon a business basis,
that they may be administered by tha people
in the interest of all the people on the prin
ciple of home rule. No franchise, extension or
renewal thereof ever to be granted by any city
or village without first submitting the same to
a vote of Â¦ the people.

away a better paper than sollo
and costs 15 per cent less.ment and all kinds of machinery save
agricultural machinery. There is as yet
no agriculture in Manchuria, and not
enough in Siberia to justify the importa
tion of machinery. The steamers will
bring to America teas, silks, dried fish,
gold, copper, coal and tobacco. If Man
churia is ever opened to settlement the
lumbering industry willalso grow to enor
mous proportions, for there are vast for
ests there which have never been touched.
More than this, there is the trade of
Europe, much of which will eventually
come this way. But it will be seen that
for many years to come, at all events, the
balance of trade between San Francisco
and Siberia and Russian Manchuria must
be in favor of this port.
The steamers of the Russian line al
ready built and those building are large,
modern vessels of the most approved pat
tern, and will make competition on the
Pacific of the keenest. Running as they
will under the flag and with the protection
of the Russian Government, the competi
tion will be in fact as well as in name,
and the struggle for commercial su
premacy between the Russian city and the
English and Japanese ports ln the Orient
will be a death grapple from the first.
The merchants of San Francisco will do
well to keep their attention upon the new
Russian city of Dalny. When the Czar
builds a city he sees that it becomes
great, and the building of Dalny is a part
of the Russian plan to win unquestioned
supremacy in Northern Asia.
it Â¦will one day be enormous in volume â

tures of the United States destined to
supply the colonists on the steppes of Si
beria will be received and transhipped at
Dalny. and from Dalny the products of
the Old World will be shipped to San
Francisco for distribution to all parts of
America. The trade that has already be
gun to find its T7ay to -Vladivostok will
eventually â¢ be centered at the new and
more southerly port of Dalny, where there
will be no freezing of the sea to block
commerce in winter.
It will be from Dalny that the new
steamship line between San Francisco and
the Russian possessions in Asia 'will run.
The company that is to run these steam
ers, a Russian corporation, is already in
existence and is pushing out boats for
trade along the shores of China. One of
the boats that is destined for the trans
pacific trade is completed. A second wai
launched last month. Eight more have
been contracted for and will be built as
speedily as possible. The first of these
boats to cross the Pacific will reach the
port of San Francisco in December next,
and after that the boats will make regu
lar trips.
Possibilities of Trade.
The steamers will carry away from 4he
shores of America lumber, provisions of
all kinds, but especially flour, , canned
goods and meats; iron and the manufac

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
"Dunn, under the arrangement which
Lewis had with him, according to Lewis'
statement to us. was to receive one
fourth of all big claims, and this $200 was
Dunn's one-fourth of these two bills,
which I had collected on Lewis' assign
ment. My father asked Dunn for a re
ceipt, but Dunn declined to give one.
"We both spoke to Lewis and told him
that this kind of business was not right;
that he was not getting from the State
for his material any more than he
charged others for it, and that, in fact, he
was simply surrendering to Dunn a por
tion of his own earnings. Lewis replied
that he could not help it, that he had to
give up to Dunn."
Dunn declined to make any statement
to-day, saying- that he had told his story
to the Commissioners. He denied the
charge of blackmailing.
"I know of my own knowledge that
Thomas Lewis did pay to State Gardener
M. H. Dunn a commission on the bills
which were allowed Lewis on Dupn's
'O' K' mark. I saw Dunn paid $200 of this
money. It was . Dunn's percentage
money, which I had collected at the State
Treasurer's office on a claim assigned to
me by Lewis. The money was paid to
Dunn by my father, in' the presence of
Lewis, at* our old offlce at Third and J
streets, ln January, 1899, and was Dunn's
commission on two bills which had just
been allowed Lewis by the State, one for
$625 for fertilizer, and the other a separ
ate bill for $175 for various items.

adduced at the examination was of a
damaging character, Lewis saying: that
He had paid one-quarter of his earnings
from the State- to Gardener Dunn, this
payment being: a condition reaulred by
Dunn before he would "O K" the claims.
Although the Investigation was conducted
In secret and the Commisisoners have not

Ask for a Sheriff's Removal.
TOPEKA, Kans.. July 10.â A delegation
from the Colored Ministerial Union of
Kansas is here endeavoring to persuade
Governor Stanley to remove Sheriff Ever
hardt of Leavenworth County from offlce.
They claim the Sheriff was guilty of mal
feasance in not attempting to rescue or
protect Fred Alexander, the young negro
â¢who was burned at the stake by a Leav
enworth mob on January 15 last. Â¦ Tho
Governor and Attorney General are con

SOME Idea of the character of the
work the Russians are doing at
Port Arthur may be gathered trom
the picture that accompanies this
article, the first photograph from
the neighborhood of the Czar's great fort
ress en the Chinese coast that has ever
been printed in this country- Probably it
Is the first photograph ever taken of Port
Arthur. The officers of the Russian Gov
ernment do not lend any great degree of
encouragement to the kodak idea, partic
ularly in the vicinity of defensive works.
The picture was obtained by a gentleman
who passed through that region lately
and is the choicest ln his collection. It
shows the outer harbor, and is taken from
the railroad " wharf . On the bluff to the
right are the great defensive works of the
port, built by the Russians and destined
to make Port Arthur ln effect impregna
ble. Within this bluff and still to the
right lies the Inner harbor, while the
basin and the Government docks are to
the left.
It is deemed necessary to thus expialn
the photograph both because it is the first
ever printed and because the people of
San Kranclsco have more than a. passing
Interest in the work the Russian Govern
ment is now doing at Port Arthur and all
through Manchuria. It will be borne in
mind that at the close of the Chinese-
Japanese war, when the forces of the
Mikado captured the Chinese stronghold
of Weihaiwei, there was a sudden and
startling collapse of the Peking Govern
ment and the world saw that the Mon
golian giant was the veriest weakling
among the nations. Then came the treaty
of peace negotiated between the plenipo
tentiaries of the powers and the cession
of Manchuria to Japan ln default of a
war indemnity.
The Sand of Russia.
It was at this point that the White Czar
showed his hand. It was no part of the
Russian plan that the control of Man
churia should pass to any power other
than the Muscovite. Manchuria was the
key to the Russian situation in Eastern
Asia. So long as China held Manchuria
and .China was strong the Czar would
make no move. With China known to be
weak it was not to be tolerated that a
strong power should enter that province
and hold the Russian forever locked ln
the Ice of Siberia. The great trans-Si
berian Railway, pushing out from. Mos
cow and St. Petersburg to Vladivostok,
would find the sea and justify itself both
as a commercial enterprise and as a
strategic movement, but it woiild find the
sea, with Manchuria in hostile hands, at
a point that would be locked in ice during
at least half the year. Russia could never
realize that supremacy in the Northern
Pacific, of which "all Russian statesmen
dream, with only the port of Vladivostok
as a marine base. The Russian vision has
been of a port below the freezing zone.
The prowess of Japan gave the Russians
their opportunity. The war and the out
rages of the Boxers made that oppor
tunity complete. When Japan seized Wei
haiwei Russia coolly seized Port Arthur,
and the Chinese Government connived at
the seizure. The reason for that became
apparent later. The treaty of peace nego
tiated with Japan, giving to that country
practical possession of the province of
Manchuria, was no sooner promulgated
than the St. Petersburg Government
stepped to the front with the announce
ment that Russia could not look with in
difference upon this practical dismember
ment of the Chinese empire "in a quarter
that had always been considered within

Russia, unknown to the world, la build
ing a great port on the gulf of Talienwan,
almost under tho guns of Port Arthur
Forty miles in> a northwesterly direction
from that fortress, on the shore of the
gulf of Talienwan and with a harbor that
is said by expert engineers to be one of
the best and most commodious In the
â¢world, the Russians have laid the founda
tions of their new city. It is called Dal
ny. The name is Russian and the plans
will be Russian. The siteâ for the build-
Ing of the city has already begunâ is on
the line of the Manchuria Railway. Dal
ny will be, in fact, the commercial ter
minus of that line and the point from
which Russian enterprise will seek to con
trol the commerce of the Pacific. There
will be great business houses there, and
from that port the steamers that are to
carry the Russian flag to all the western
world will clear. Tho vast trade from
America to Europe through Siberiaâ and
Eus3ia's New City.
But in the seizure of Port Arthur the
whole Russian scheme was not accom
plished. That gave a military and naval
base. The Russians are a modern ag
gressive people, and they realize therefore
that it is also necessary to secure com
mercial supremacy in the Northern Pa
cific. Port Arthur gives them the mili
tary advantage Manchuria gives that
military base unbroken communication by
land with the capital of the Muscovite
empire over Russian territory. It Is neces
sary to found a great commercial entrepot
with a trade that will ramify to all the
points oÂ» the shores of the great ocean
at the doors of Russia and America. It
is here that the vital Interest of San
Francisco in the movements of Russia
comes in, for it is with this future Rus
sian metropolis that the commerce of San
Francisco will be carried on.
Then came the concession for a Russian
railway through Manchuria from Mukden
to Port Arthur, giving an outlet for the
trans-Siberian line south of the freezing
zone. That was a long step, although the
railway still ran through Chinese terri
tory. Not until the Boxer outbreak did
the Russians complete the work that was
probably In the minds of the St. Peters
burg Cabinet when Port Arthur was
seized. The relief of the legationers at
Peking saw at its close the' Russians In
actual armed possession of the whole of
Manchuria, and saw, too, the expressed
purpose of the Czar to hold what he had
taken, despite the protest of all the world
In arms. The world in arms weakened
and the Czar holds what he has. In the
dispatches of yesterday the announcement
was made that China had resolved to
withdraw all Its troops from Manchuria
"to avoid the possibility of collision with
the Russians." This may not be an actual
cession of territory in form, but it an
swers the same purpose. The Russians
have the province.
Russia and the Boxers.
the sphere of Russian Influence." The
Mikado did not deem himself as strong
then as he probably does now, and Man
churia was abandoned. It was said at the
time by the diplomatic â¢world that China
had paid Port Arthur as the price of the
interference of Russia. It w.as known
then and has become more apparent since
that Russian diplomacy has made the rep
resentative of the Czar at Peking- the
most influential of all the European diplo
mats accredited to the court of the Man
chu Emperor. The Russian Embassador
was listened to when any other European
Minister who approached the forbidden
city took his life in his hands. And the
prestige of England, which Russia had
most gravely to fear in the Far East, was
destroyed almost at one blow.

There are about fifty men employed at
1 he sawmill, which Is owned by TV. J.
Doherty of the Union Lumber Company
of this city. It was at first supposed by
the xr.en that Mrs. Kinney had been fa
tally stabbed. Since it has been learned
that her wounds, while painful, are not
fatal, though they will disfigure her for
life, end that the Chinese was probably
insane, those at the mill wish that the
lynching might be undone. This was the
first lynching ln this part of the State
during the past fifteen years.
Lynchcrs Are Sorry Now.
"I learned after the inquest that as Mr.
Kinney was struggling with the Chinese
he was bitten in the wrist. The wound is
deep and painful. It Is hard for those at
the mill to determine whether Yung Fook,
who?* life paid the forfeit for his actions,
was insane or naturaily vicious."
"By this time the employes rushed the
Chinese in a body and after a severe
struggle he was knocked down. Mr. Kin
ney hurried to his wife's assistance and
Cli not witness the lynching. Others ex
amined at the inquest were exceedingly
re acent in regard to the affair.
"The Chinese, now frantic with Insane
rage, slashed at the frightened woman's
face. The knife sank Into the flesh over
the cheek to the bone and from the mouth
around and under the ear! Mrs. Kinney
ran screaming toward the men for help,
but she -was soon overtaken by Yung
F"ook, who threw her down. Tie was about
to plunge the knife into her breast when
her 13-year-old daughter grasped the
cook's queue and pulled him quickly over
upon his back. Jumping to his feet, he
out the child on the -wrist. Mr. Kinney,
5n attempting to protect his family, was
sliphtly stabbed in the arm.
"According to the story related by Mr.
Kinney. his wife was well pleased with
Yung Fook as a cook, but a few days ago
he had threatened to leave, but as hi3
salary was raised $5 a month he consented
to remain. Yesterday afternoon Mrs.
Kinney told the cook to fry some meat
which she was afraid was about to spoil.
Fook. who had acted peculiarly, without
Training lung-ed at Mrs. Kinney viciously
with a butcher knife. Her corset steels
turned the knife blade, undoubtedly sav
ing- her life.
Attacks Without Warning.
BAKERSFTELD, July 10.â Sheriff Borg
traxdt, accompanied by Coroner Buckreus,
I>eputy District Attorney Dorsey and
Court Reporter Laird, returned to-night
from Mount Breckenridge, whither he had
gpne to Investigate the lynching of Yung
fook by the employes of the sawmills at
that place. The Coroner's Jury returned
a verdict of "death by hanging at the
bands of parties unknown." No arrests
were made, els It was impossible to fix the
responsibility for the tragedy by the tes
timony given at the Inquest by the em
ployes of the place.
The story of the lynching and prior
events Is full of dramatic situations and
proves that Charlotte, the 13-year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. G. C. Kinney.
both of whom were stabbed by the Chi
nese, is a heroine.
"When I arrived at the sawmill." said
Sheriff Borgwardt, "the body of the Chi
nese was still dangling from the tree
â¢where he had been hanged the night be
fore. ThÂ© corpse was cut down, A. large
lump was noticeable on his forehead, pre
sumably caused by the blow struck by
one of the men during the struggle.

(Last night .hundreds of people slept in
the streets and all were anxious to main
tain their places in the lines, which began
forming yesterday at the six registration
booths in El Reno. Many had waited on
the border: of the new country for two
years or more, and. the last night of their
long vigil was the most trying 'they had
experienced. . The- line Â¦ was made up- of

The lottery scheme robbed the . "open

opening ten years ago. Compared with
that event the affair is tame, in the ex
treme. Although there' are perhaps 20,000
people in town no disorder 'prevails. As
a 'rule the home, seekers ; were > well pro
vided with money and i â¢ provisions, and
aside from the long wait in the sun be
fore the registration booths no serious in
convenience has been experienced.

out the proclamation of President Mc-
Kinley opening up â¢ to settlement by tho
whites the 13,000 farms in the Kiowa and
Cqmanche country, the first registration
of home seekers was made.] here and, at

CROWDS WAIT

Trouble was prevented by the early an
nouncement that the line organization
would be respected by the Government of
ficers. Cheers and waving of hats greeted
the word and from this time on there was
no sign of trouble. Applicants were ad
mitted to the booths four at a time and
the filing proceeded rapidly all day long.
' During the day the heat became intense,
but no serious suffering was reported. The
numerous women in line were treated gal
lantly by the men, who shaded them from
the sun with umbrellas and furnished
drinks from the lemonade venders.
The second place of registration named
in the proclamation was at Lftwton, twen
ty-five miles overland, where r similar
scenes to those enactett in El Reno were
witnessed. The people in the vicinity; of

Mr. C. George Krogness of Chicago, whai
Is a special advertising agent represent*
Ing several of the leading dallies of the
United States, has for several weeks been,
suffering from serious complications re
sulting from overwork, and accordingly
left Chicago about a week ago for a trip
to California.
He was provided with transportation,
which he carried In a pocket memoran
dum book, and leaving bis affairs In com
petent hands started on bis journey. His
route took him over the Burlington to
Denver, the Denver and Rio Grande and
the Rio Grande and "Western to Ogderi
and the Southern Pacific to San Fran
cisco.
As a rule in his travels Mr. Krogness,
possessed of a very affable disposition,
converses freely with the different con
ductors en route, but on this trip, feellns
too weak to talk, he lay Idly back; on the
Pullman cushions and handed up his
pecketbook to whatever conductor ap
peared without looking to see if the tick
ets were properly punched or the coupons
regularly torn off. He noticed, however,
that each conductor scrutinized his face
intently and quizzically, then smiled and
passed on without comment.
His serenity was undisturbed until near
ing Sixteenth street, Oakland, -where the
ferry tickets are given out. Mr. Krog
ness failed to receive his and asked the
conductor for one. The latter laughed
and reulied: "That ticket of yours is
good on any train in the United States,
old boy. but I can't Issue transfers on it
without getting into trouble."
"Why, what do you mean?" exclaimed
Krogness. "Aren't my tickets regular?"
And he pulled out his pocketbook.
All that he found there was a. miniature
reproduction of the well-known "hold-up'*
Gold Dust poster which adorns the bill
boards of every city In the country.
He was simply bereft of speech for the
nonce, then lie exclaimed: "You don't
mean to tell me that I have traveled from
Chicago across the continent on an ad
vertisement of Gold Dust washing pow
der, do you?"
"That's what you have." replied tho
man of the punch. "There Isn't a con

Oroville Team, the Dissenting Ele

for All Clubs.
TTOODL.AXD. July 10.â The Northern
California Baseball League is in danger
of going to piece?. It was originally
composed of four clubsâ Woodland,
Marysville, Oroville and Sacramento.
These clubs have bÂ«en putting- up cham
pionship.ball and drawing big crowds. For
some time there has been dissatisfaction
among the subscribers as well as among
the players with the Oroville manage
ment.
The trouble culminated last Sunday in
the retirement of the Oroville manager
arid the failure of the club to meet the
Woodland club on the OroviUe diamond
In a regularly scheduled league game.
Efforts so far to reorganize the club un
der a new management . have been un
availing:. Unless it is done soon an ef
fort will be made to gpt another club to
take the place of Oroville. . In the event
of failure to do that the league will prob
ably go to pieces. Woodland has been
giving Its club good support and there will
be much regret if the league should be

Start Is Made, but Boats Are

View.
NEWPORT, R. I..' July 10.â The . third
race between the Constitution, Columbia
and Independence came to an inglofious
end late this afternoon In a dead calm
and thickest kind of Atlantic fog. There
was little time to form judgment on the.
relative speed of the three boats, for in
less than half an hour after the start the
boats ran into the fog and at no time
after that could all three be seen at one
time. ,.
A little over an hour after the start the
Constitution withdrew and came back to
the start. The Columbia and Indepen
dence stood on for the outer mark, which
they rounded with the Columbia about a
mile in the lead. The wind, however, died
down almost to a calm and the leading
boat could not finish in the time limit.
The race was therefore off and will be
sailed over to-morrow. At the timo the
Constitution withdrew, she was leading
the Columbia in the beat to windward by
nearly a mile and the Independence by
nearly two*miles. .
SUPERVISORS SIT
AS EQUALIZERS
Several Small Property-
Owners Secure Lower
Assessments.
The Board of Supervisors met as a
Board of Equalization yesterday after
noon and proceeded to consider the appli
cations- of many small and a few large
property owners for reductions in their
assessments. Mayor Phelan was not pres
ent when the meeting opened, although
he dropped in later, and Supervisor Mc-
Carthy took the chair.
Alexander W. Wilson was denied a re
duction in his assessment of property at
Turk and Taylor streets from $40,000 to
$20,000, and R. J. Techau, who wanted a
$10,000 reduction on a $20,000 assessment,
was allowed $5000.
Then Daniel Meyer, capitalist, stood up
before the board and was sworn. He was
asked what reduction he wanted.
--Â¦ "I- don't want any. said Meyer. â¢ "I
don't want to be raised."
"How much were you assessed for?"
asked Supervisor McCarthy.
"Five hundred and eighty thousand dol
larF." . . â¢-
"Did you apply for a reduction?" â¢ â¢
"No; I was void to come up, so I would
not be raised." _;
"Ah," said McCarthy.- - "Your '. assess-'
ment was arbitrary?" .- . . .
"That is so." . ._
"And was it just? Have you that "much
personal property?" . . , ', -
"I cannot say. Possibly less; possibly
more.. I do not know- how much. But I
do not want it raised."
"Let us hear from the Assessor," sug
gested McCarthy.
"I object." said Supervisor Stafford.
"The Assessor should not say anything
until Meyer justifies himself."
"How '.can I justify ' myself ?" asked
Meyer." -;
"You have not given a proper answer tc
the question," replied Siafford.
Does Not Know How Wealthy He Is.
"I cannot give any other answer. I do
not know how much I am worth."
"But we want to know," Stafford insist
ed. "We would like to raise you if we
could. >
"That is a bad spirit," said Meyer,
sadly.
Then he went away, and the Mayor,
who came in at the moment and bowed
to Aley<$r, , observed, solto voce, "A- case
of Daniel in the lions' den."
The board reduced the assessment of
the Pacific Glass Works to a merely nom
inal figure because the old plant had been
abandoned.
H. H. Wyckoff, representing the Congre
gational Church Building Society of New
York, asked to be relieved of the pay
ment of taxes on a mortgage for $1403
given by Bethlehem Congregational
Church to the people he represents, be
cause the money had been borrowed to
build a church and 'was in a sense a char
itable donation, inasmuch as no interest
was charged on the loan. ...
"It makes no real difference to us,"
Wyckoff said, "because if the mortgage is
taxed the congregation will feel in honor
bound to pay the taxes."
Raises a New Point.
The point raised was a new one. "But,"
said the Mayor, "how far can the board
take cognizance of the benevolent, inten
tion of mortgagees? We do not dispute
you, but we are not exempting from txa
ation money lenders who advance money
to churches with the expectation of get
ting their interest in heaven. If you had
taken a mere note from Bethlehem con
gregation, trusting to its honor to repay
you, we -could 'not have levied a tax." .
The application after some discussion
was rejected.
The balance of the session was devoted
to the equalization of small assessments,
almost every application made. for reduc
tion being granted.
The list of arbitrary assessments was
then taken up, together with the names
of those property owners who had been
notified but who had failed to appear. Of
these latter all reductions 'Â¦ recommended
by the Assessor were ordered made. The
others, with the list of arbitrary assess
ments, went over for consideration until
next Friday at 2:30 p. m., to which time
the board adjourned.
Would Evade Franchise Tax.
Wells, Fargo & Co. filed a petition yes
terday with the Board of Supervisors for
a reduction of the assessment on its fran
chise of .The petition recites that
the secretary of the company made re
turn to the Assessor on June 11 as to the
personal property owned by the company,
and Assessor Dodge placed an assessment
thereon of $533,267. To this sum Dodge
added $750,000 for the company's ' fran
chise, on which no return had been made.
The company claims that its franchise is
not assessable .under the laws of the
State, and the Assessor did' not take into
account that the corporation pays taxes
in 3500 places where it has an office, and
that a higher standard of valuation was
used by the Assessor than that employed
in assessing other corporations,
j The Giant Powder Company also peti
tioned that the assessment on its franchise
of $150,000 be canceled. The company
claims to have paid $576 58 on a valuation
of $35,482 on its personal property, which
included $10,000 on .' its < franchise. Dodge
thereafter made another assessment of
$150,000 against the corporation.

FROM SEATTLE.
The hearing of the petition of Theresa
A. Oelrichs, Viriginia Vanderbilt and
Charles LÂ». Fair for distribution to them
of the personal property of' the estate
of the late James G. Fair has been turn
ed into a scramble for attorneys' fees,
with the attorneys representing the trus
tes and executors leading the scramble.
Ex-Governor Budd, Knight & Heggerty
and Charles S. Wheeler have been exam
ining Charles S. Neal, manager of the
estate, for several days to try and estab
lish the great value of the personal prop
erty which there is to distribute and 40
establish a basis for the construction of
the trust clause of the will so. that it will
fall, let loose. the personal property .into
the hands of the Fair heirs and bring big
fees to them. Attorney McEnerney ; and
ex-Judge Haynei on the other hand,
simply want to prove that the work of the
executors and their lawyers was 'well
done. They want to sustain the validity
of the trust clause If possible.
The attorneys for the executors have
already received $185,000 for their ser
vices. Under Judge Coffey's schedule
the attorneys' fees on a $17,000,000 estate,
which it is claimed the Fair estate is,
would amount to $53,000. The attorneys
have already received about four times
this amount.
On the other hand, the attorneys repre
senting the Fair heirs have not as yet
been paid. Their fees are all contingent,
so yesterday ex-Governor Budd protested
and "Wheeler protested against the effort
of opposing counsel to produce testimony
upon which to base their demand for
counsel fees, while Hayne and McEnerney
fought for the coveted right. Finally
Judge Troutt ruled that in the hearing at
bar it was not 'proper to establish a basis
for a demand in the future for attorneys'
fees, but he Initmated that in event he
ordered the distribution of the personal
property to the heirs he would order $100,
000 withheld for which the attorneys for
the trustees could battle later.
During the morning session Manager
Neal talked about millions. His, testi
mony established the following facts rela
tive to the present financial condition of
the estate:
- Total income from real estate since death,
$1,379,077 53; income sales, real estate, $150,000;
income from Pine and Sansome, $268,511 83; in
come, Mission-street property. $40,862 12; in
come from personal property, $1,887,27133; in
come from sales of personal property. $4,164.
641 80 Total repairs, $338,113 38; wheat on
hand. $30,0C0.
These figures show that the estate has
certainlv prospered . since the death of
James G. Fair and furnish a good basics
for an argument by the attorneys repre
senting the executors that their demand
for. a few hundred Â« thousand dollars is
naught but reasonable.

2JE1J7S OF THE OCEAN.
The owners of the May Flint are mak
ing good progress with the wrecking of
that vessel. They have already recov
ered 3%0 tons of her coal cargo and now
work has begun on the hull. It was at
first thought the vessel couid be raised.
but an examination showed that her back
was broken. Monday last she was blown
to pieces, and yesterday the wreckers
xt-j-re engaged in recovering portions of
the hu!l. Whatever i.= salved will be sold
for old iron, and the owners expect to
make enough out of it to pay all expenses.
Â¦Wrecking the May Flint.
Round about the foot of Third street
and infesting the hay wharf Is a gang of
"wharf rats" that is making the lives of
policemen and night watchmen miserable.
It is only a few nights since they board
ed the scow Mir.nette and heaving up the
anchor sailed her over to Oakland Creek.
They then stripped her of sails, running
gear, anchor and chain, compass and car
go covers and left her, hard and fast in
the mud. Next they ransacked the
schooner Chevalier and stole thÂ« cap
tain's clothes while he slept. In the pock
ets was the month's wages to pay the
crew, so the "rats" secured more than
S200. Eob GibEon had his Whitehall made
fast with a chain and padlock, but they
stole boat, chain, padlock and all. Hardly
a night passes but a dingey is stolen, and
the people in the vicinity are now satis
fied that nothing but a police patrol boat
will stop the thieving. San- Francisco is
the only "harbor in the world of its size
that cannot boast such a service, so it is
no wonder the "wharf rats" have it all
their own way.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's Zea

II . the fastest of the mosquito fleet
of lumber vessels. Captain Han
sen cf the S. Danielson holds the
same high opinion abo'ufHiis vessel, while
Captain Gruggel thinks the Sacramento
can beat anything of her size sailing out
of the Oolden Gate. The owners of the
vessels hold the same opinions as their
captains, so when the schooners were
ready for sea iast Friday a "three-cor
nered" race for $50 "a. corner" was ar
ranged. All three are now out six days
for Siuslaw River, and the owners of the
Nettie Sundborg expect to hear of her ar
rival early next week. Arrangements
have been made with the telegraph peo
ple and the result of the race will be sent
to the Merchants' Exchange. Ever since
the three schooners started it has been
blowing strong from the northwest, so
there will be plenty of chance for seaman
ship. It will be a dead beat to windward
all the wav up. and the chances are that
none of the vessels will reach Siuslaw by
next Monday.

â¢Twin Screw Express Steamers. â¢ â¢ <-â¢ Eastern folks are praying that the late hot spell may
be known as the htottest of the, twentieth century.
Thcv have no desire, to see the record broken
The Alabama constitutional convention is said to
be, confronted by an unexpected snag; it has ex
cluded the negro from the franchise. very neatly, but
now the female suffragists are demanding a ; hearing.
All talk about a probable commercial war between
this country' a r -d Russia might as well be stopped â¢
the Czar has recently invited our Embassador to
lunch.
It is announced from Washington that the Chinese
Minister Hires to have his name spelled Wu Ting-fang.
His family name is Wu, and he is proud of it. '
BY the New York Tribune there was recently
published from its Paris correspondent a de
tailed statement of the taxes imposed by the
French Government upon posters and billboard ad
vertising. Under the French law a "poster" is any
written, printed or painted placard exhibited on a
wall, boarding or other public place in order to spread
information of any kind. All- governmental posters,
whether set up by the courts or by executive or leg
islative authority, are on white paper/ while, all private
posters must be on colored paper and carry the gov
ernmental stamp.
The stamp tax varies with the size of the poster
and the population of the community. The. revenue
produced by it in 1898 was 3,515,000 francs, and in
1899 it was 3Â»553..o6o francs. The figures for 1900' were
not given by the .writer, because the income for that
year, by reason of thevexposition, was so much in
creased as not to afford a fair test of the value of the
tax as a revenue producer.
The example of France is of importance- to all
American cities that are struggling with â¢ the bill
board nuisance. It seems clear that the most "effective
way to deal with the evil would be to impose a tax
somewhat similar to that in France. The tax would
not be onerous, nor would it prevent any legitimate
advertiser from making use of that method of attract
ing the attention of the public to his wares if he chose,
but it would have the effect of putting a stop to the
display of many of those hideously ugly and enormous
placards that disgrace our cities.
There is no reason why those whomake use of walls
and fences along the public streets to get a profit
from them should not be made to pay a fair amount
of tax. The tax. too, might be made to settle the
question of. the height of permissible billboards. . If
a properly graded tax were imposed they would not
go too high. This is one of the things in which we
can learn something from Paris*. -
FRENCH POSTER TAXES.
Political economists and other philosophers have
been of the opinion that the drift of population frpm
the rural districts of England to the towns is due to
the decline of agriculture and the . higher rate of
wages in : . the* cities; but one laborer, when asked by
a commission tl;e other day why he had left the coun
try, replied: "I could not stand it, sir. There wasn't
an alehouse within a mile of the farm."
With such high-sounding words and lofty senti
ments did the astute Minister make his olea ae-ninsf.
Having thus laid down the proposition that Ameri
cans and Chinese are alike in their belief in popular
sovereignty, the orator went on to point out that
commerce is drawing them nearer together and that
it is to the interest of both to extend and multiply
their commercial relations. Then he hastened to his
conclusion: "Your invitation to me shows that your
patriotism is not of that kind which cannot see any
thing good in the people of other lands, and the
motto of which is, "Our country, right or wrong.'
That is only national selfishness which goes by the
name of patriotism. It is a relic of bygone days,
when there- was comparatively little intercourse be
tween the people of orte country and those of an
other, and when a man could be free to enjoy life
and liberty only in the land of his birth. All of that
is now completely changed. Happily we live in a
more humane and enlightened age. National inter
ests have gradually given way to world interests, and
the day is not far distant when love of country will
be secondary to humanity as a virtue. This: nation
has not sprung into existence without a manifest des
tiny. It was established * * * to treat all peo
ple alike with fairness and justice: to do away with
all selfish and clannish feelings; to make American
patriotism synonymous with fair play, with love of
mankind, with full freedom and liberty in accord with
law and justice."
The argument opens with comparison of the Gov
ernment of China with that of the United States, and
the claim is made that in China as in the United
States there is a complete recognition of popular
sovereignty. Minister Wu went on to say: "The
difference between the two countries lies in the man
ner in which the principle is carried out. You be
lieve in the choice of officers through the ballot-box;
we believe in the choice of public officers through the
examination hall. In this country all men are equal
at the polls. * * * The man who has grown gray
in the service of his country, as well as the man who
has just taken out his naturalization papers, has no
more than one vote. Every vote counts as much as
any other, and those who get the most. votes are en
titled to represent the people. *__* * In China we
endeavor to attain the same end by a different road.
The competitive examinations are open to all. All
candidates stand on the. same ground and have, an
equal chance of success. â¢ * * * In that way a cer
tain proportion of the ruling class of the land is
drawn directly from the people."
FULL reports of the Fourth of July address de
livered by Minister Wu Ting- fang at Philadel
phia^have now been received in our Eastern ex
changes, and judging by the comments of several of
the leading papers of that, section of the country it
was a distinguished success. A careful reading -of it
shows that from first to last it was a subtle'and clever
plea against any further extension of the Chinese ex
clusion act The Minister, of course, did not refer
to the act, but none the less the logic of his argument,
if accepted, would carry with it a condemnation of
any measure of the kind.
MINISTER WU'S ORATION.
rr.d appreciated. Our government in the Philippines
is purely autocratic, with no popular feature in it.
A similar community of Americans would destroy it
":i an hour rather than submit to it a minute. This
i<; hot denying that it is good government, superior
to any the Filipinos bsve known, but it is a despot
ism imposed from without. That three of its eight
members are natives does not change it, for they
were not elected by the people. That part of the
Fystern is copied from England's scheme in India,
where there is a minority of natives in the Council,
uot enough to make things go right, but enough to
be accused of responsibility if they go wrong.
It is necessary to say these things in order that our
cwn people may not deceive themselves as to the
problem in the islands. It is not solved by the pres
ent scheme of government, nor by the cessation of
armed resistance in rrany of the provinces. It will
not be solved by making Territories of the islands,
for that makes them potential States, and our people
will rot have them as States, and will grind to pow
der any party that proposes it. Let the truth be told
The financial report from the islands shows that
we have taken out of them the same taxes as Spain
did, $10,000,000 a year. So in denial of self-govern
ment and burden -of taxation they are just
where they were when Dr. Rizal and Aguin
aldo made their first stand for freedom in
1896. They cannot effectively reach the source of the
laws that govern them any more now than they could
â¢when Weyler was the Captain General. Those laws
could be just as well passed in San Francisco and ex
ported to them.
But that is neither self-government nor a step in
that direction, long or short. No one cares to dis
cuss the islands. The country seems tired of that.
But let us not confuse our own ideas of self-govern
ment If the eight men who are to legislate for
twelve millions of people had been elected, by those
people," then their power and the laws they pass
would be derived from the people affected by them.
If the laws were oppressive the oppressed could re
peal them by electing other legislators for that pur
pose. But the Philippine legislature is not elected by
the people, nor are they consulted in its appointment,
r.or are natives given a majority in its membership,
nor can the people displace it and elect others. The
plan is just as far away from self-government as was
the Spanish rule. It is, in form, exactly the same
despotism, the difference in our favor being its
greater benevolence.
THE Oakland Enquirer, a paper edited with
quite unusual care and discrimination, makes an.
odd blunder in its characterization of the new
Philippine government The five American members
of the commission, with three natives, constitute the
legislative department of the government They are
all appointed from Washington. The Enquirer says:
"It is a pretty long Â«tep in the direction of giving
the Filipinos self-government to make three island
ers members of the legislative body which frames
government for the provinces and municipalities,
makes appropriations, establishes schools and enacts
all other important laws."
NOT SELF-GOVERNMENT.
Ex-Senator Edmunds says that for the redemption
of Philadelphia there is needed "the most complete
and united organization possible of all voters with
out regard to party, society, sect or any other thing,
who wish to overcome the existing evil condition of
the government of the city." Philadelphia is evi
dently in a much worse condition than San Francisco,
for to. redeem this city there is needed no other uniqn
than that of the better elements of the Republican
party..
It is possible that British politicians feel the need
of something to rouse the flagging jingo spirit at
home and to divert the rising sympathy in the world
for the forlorn Boers. Nothing could do 'this* more
effectually than such' a story. But suppose it is true,
still there is Kitchener and the record of Omdurman.
The public opinion of the world w ; U receive the
story of Boer outrage of the wounded with much
caution. The Dutch are a race accustdmed to* face
peril and go into hard undertakings. Their battles
have always been against a,, superior force. When
Spain was as strong as'^ Great Britain is now the
Dutch withstood her, under circumstances as forlorn
as those in South Africa, and finally won by sheer
persistence and courage. Yet in all that dreary and
bloody struggle for the independence of The Nether
lands there is no record of their slaughter of the
wounded or other violations of fair war. That was
more than two centuries ago, when the war code was
not as scrupulous as it is now and combatants were
permitted a.greater latitude. If 4hey refrained then,
when fighting the savage Alva, it is not likely that
they yield to temptation now. â¢' -
In a late delivery Lord Salisbury admitted that
England was hated, and to be safe in her empire must
also be feared. Her South African policy will cer
tainly not mitigate any hatred that others may feel
for her, though it may inspire that fear which seems
necessary to her^velfare.
IT is inconceivable that if the unsigned story of,
killing the wounded by the Boers were true it
would be censored by the British authorities.
It happens that the British commander in South
Africa is Lord Kitchener, whose wholesale slaughter
of the wounded at the battle of Omdurman appalled
the world, and was freely published. by the British
press. Under the circumstances it is hardly possible
that his Lordship would rigidly censor the news of
like conduct by the Boers, as his misery in that con
nection is of the kind that 'loves company. At the
same time it must be admitted that his- military policy
is calculated to provoke "desperate reprisals.. The
wholesale destruction of Boer homes and farmsteads,
atid the driving of women and children and aged non
corfibatants like cattle into stockades, where the little
ones perish by hundreds, is not calculated to pro
mote "a gentle frame of mind in the fathers and
brothys of these helpless victims of a ruthless policy.
The banishment of Cronje and the exiling of military
prisoners to the various hells which Great Britain
.owns in the tropics is another measure that prolongs
the war and increases its horrors.

There may be people who make fun of Missouri, but

It will be perceived that Wu's speech was highly
successful from his point of view. It is not strictly
true that he has revolutionized public sentiment, as
the Baltimore American says, but he has evidently
accomplished a good deal in that direction. Upon
the exclusion act, therefore, it behooves Californians
to prepare themselves for a hard fight. . Minister Wu
is not an opponent to b'e despised.
_LL.D., _was gracefully and forcibly "portraying in In
dependence square the high ethical principles that
cluster around Independence day, the. inveterate ene
mies of his race, even the California Congressmen,
were vaunting their design and ability to. prolong for
another twenty years after May next the peculiarly
despotic end un-American edict of exclusion now in
force in this country against the brilliant Dr. Wu's
the (exclusion act. The Baltimore American, in com
menting^pon it, said: "Minister Wu, .without craft,
has succeeded in revolutionizing public opinion in the
IJnited States with regard to his country." The Phil
adelphia Record' said: While ,'Wu Ting-fang,
All men know that no matter upon what pretext
or upon what profession of virtue the Democracy
achieve power, they will use it to again disorder the
revenue and financial system of the country, with the
same old result which has always followed such
erratic change in policy and unsettling of the foun
dations of prosperity. If Republican rings and bosses
repeat frequently the misdeeds which are a stench in
Pennsylvania, they will be responsible for a party
disaster which will be also a misfortune to the coun
try. The Call makes no excuse for its constant effort
to secure Republican practice of the virtue professed
by the Democracy, for in that, and that alone, lies
the future safety of the party.
' Had the Democracy not thought the Whig party
dead in 1838-39 the Whigs would not have carried
the election of 1840. When a large element, in a tri
umphant party feels that the opposition is dissolved,
only the sternest measures can restrain it from
prodigal use of its power.
The Whigs were out of power in 1839 and the Dem
ocrats were in. The defalcations of Federal officers
in New York' and the charges against, Van Buren's
administration were used to convince the reason of
the people that the party in power was not living up
to its obligation to practice virtue, and that failure,
contrasted with the Whig professions, revived a party
declared to be dead, and after its official epitaph had
been written by its enemy. Not only that, but in
1848 it performed a feat that stands singular in Amer
ican politics. Â¦ It expelled from power the Democ
racy whose administration had just successfully car
ried on a popular foreign war. These incidents are
admonitory, and the Republican party everywhere
must be admonished by them. Hard times produce
political changes, and so. do good times. All men do
not consider themselves the equal beneficiaries of
good times, and as the profits of enterprise increase
so do the grudges which they arouse. Add to this
outgrowth of human envy a reckless course of con
duct on the part of the party in power, and there are
present the. .elements of a political reyolution. Al
ready it is apparent that the profound minds in Re
publican leadership appreciate this situation, and
hence such a bold stroke against the leckless ma
chine as that made by Postmaster General Smith.
-This history is of interest in view of the courageous
stand taken by the Postmaster General against the
Republican machine in Philadelphia. We lay it down
as an axiom in American politics that the party out
of power needs only to profess virtue, while the party
in power must practice it.
Â¦Yet the Whig party svept the country the next
year by a popular majority of 146,315, and by 234
electoral votes to Democracy's 60!
IN October, 1839, the Democratic Review, long the
exponent of 'that : party, announced the death/ of
the -Whig party. The Review said: "Well; the
summer and autumn elections are now for^the most
part .over,' and what have the Whigs left to say -for
themselves and their exhausted and exploded 4 cause?
Will they, can they/ pretendto maintain* any longer
even a show of regular opposition? Will they, can
they, attempt seriously to contest the coming Presf
dentiarelection? We find it difficult to imagine "that
they will or can." . . ..

OBSERVATIONS ON THOSE WHO
PUT THEIR TRUST UN TRUSTS
RECENT reviews and * magazines
have contained many articles on.
the dangers of trusts and others on
the advantages of combinations of
capital. Notably in the May North
American Review are a number, all, with
tho exception of one by Russell Sage, rad
ically favorable to the system of combin
ing capital and industrial enterprises.
A consideration of these articles leads
to the conclusion that our thinkers who
are out of the trusts see little but pros
pects of evil from sucli unprecedented
and gigantic combinations, while the
other class, principally those in the trusts,
see no real dangers and only prosperity
and progress, and anticipate that the
world is through the trusts entering upon
its first real and endless prosperity.
(Faith is always beautiful, be it faith In
God, faith in man or faith in money. I
have observed, however, that one who can
put unlimited faith in money usually has
next to no faith in God and little in man.
. To read one side only of this controversy
a person would naturally be led to sup
pose that trusts could do no good In any
way to any one. By the other It is made
to appear that they will go on benefiting
mankind and blessing the world forever.
Obviously the questions raised and now
being discussed came â¢up naturally; they
are the result of inventions, modern Im
provements and methods of doing busi
ness. To say this, however, is not to say
that they are right or wrong. Weeds
grow more naturally than grain, and be
cause a course is the one being pursued
does not prove it right nor prove it wrong,
and it may be and it usually is true that
any course partly the result of circum
stances and partly the. result of design is
partiyright and partly wrong.
Faith, of Trust Makers.
It is not surprising that those who cre
ated the trusts and whose wealth thus far
It least has been almost immeasurably In
creased thereby should admire them and
have only good reports thus far to make
and favorable anticipations of the future.
Such has been the habit of creators and
ownors from' the beeinning.
It is written that when God created the
heavens and the earth and all was fin
ished . he looked upon his work and
said, "It is good"; but even an* all-wise
mind was, either observing as to immedi
ate appearances or did not comprehend
the capacity of his creatures to turn good
into evil.
The creators of the trust assume that
they, have been tried and found perfect.
As a matter of fact they have not been
tried at all. All the great modern indus
trial combinations, except the Standard
Oil and a few others, have been formed
during the present era of good times. No
dark clouds have as yet lowered over the
house'of the trusts, no stress of any finan
cial depression or great strike or indus
trial disaster, has occurred to test their
alleged stormproof character. Thus far
they have journeyed over favorable seas,
wafted by prosperous winds, comforted
with plenty to do and many to buy, large
salaries and larger dividends. Is It any
wonder that the trusts and their bene
ficiaries are as happy and as hopeful as
lovers on their honeymoon and apparently
have as little thought of squalls and
troubles to come? That hard times will
come no man can doubt, and when they
do come, with their attendant train of
troubles and disaster and bitter discon
tent, then and not until then will the
trusts be tested and their perpetuity de
cided. The organizers' of trusts are not
only optimistic to a degree, but exceed
ingly self-sufficient and intolerant of crit
icism or interference.
Trust Organizers Resent Criticism.
Those from the outside who study them,
question them, criticize them or threaten
in any manner to control them are at
once ostracised and execrated and classed
as "meddlesome newspapers," "agitat
ors," "politicians" (a particularly low
order of creation in the minds of these
modern solons with Croesus attach
ments), "demagogues," "charlatans,"
"mountebanks" and the like.
Jt Is not wise by offensive language to
be driven to resentments or to assume be
cause an advocate is intolerant and of
fensive that he is necessarily wrong in all
claims or conclusions. These gentlemen
who write so learnedly, even interestingly,
are all advocates of the doctrine that
work can only be well done by specialists
and, not being themselves specialists in
magazine work or in literary discussion,
have doubtless proven the correctness of
their own views by not making as good
or courteous presentation as might have
been made with the material at hand. A
tyro in discussion is always contemptuous
of his adversary and Intolerant of oppo
sition. One is constrained to the belief,
however, that in some instances these
very wise and wealthy gentlemen are au*
ihors in name only and have been dis
creet enough to employ specialists to do
their literary work.

attaches itself to great wealth, a million
a year, not to mention dividends and
profits nor sucji little things as an unusual
amount of energy and much Practical
sense, all of which he possesses. But an
illustration may be drawn from his posi
tion and his argument. God and nature
filled tho earth with coal and iron. The
rivera, lakes and seas are highways sup
posed to be useful and beneficial to all
mankind. Railroads exercise the rlgnt or
eminent domain because they are. sup
posed to serve the public. But if the Fed
eral Steel Trust owns its own mines of
coal and Iron and they happen to be all
of the best and most available acquired
at nominal costs, and if they own their
own ships and railroads and factories and
fix the price of labor, the cost of produc
tion, tho expense of transportation ana
the price paid by consumers, and ail or
these questions are to be settled "in the
counting room and in the factory," and
without antagonistic action either upon
the part of the people or Congress, it
will beco"me true that government created
for the protection of all of the people must
abandon Its supposed sovereignty over all
of its subjects to a few of its subjects, or
is It the idea of our-friends'of the trusts
that governments are organized for police
purposes only to protect property and peo
ple that own property?
It Is assumed that the President of the
United States earns In his hitherto con
sidered great and responsible office fifty
thousand dollars per year enly and that
the Federal Steel Trust is dealing fairly
with consumers 'when it pays from their
contributions to its president one million
dollars per year, when all the people can
afford to pay their President such a com
paratively small salary. The Â¦whole situ
ation is preposterous, unnatural and Im
possible to be perpetuated and could only
be thought expedient or just by a Judge
sitting in his own case to decide for him
self and all others. It is true, we hope,
that broader, saner, fairer counsels than
these will prevail. It should not be as
sumed because we have great and power
ful combinations of capital we need Ies3
government and next to no government,
but upon the contrary we all need more
government, more intelligent government,
stronger government, more honest and
better government than ever before.
Control of Combinations. \
Money alone never did make mep Just
or wise. It is not written or observable
in history that great accumulators of
wealth were wise beyond their fellows or
qualified to judge better than others upon
questions pertaining to the science of gov
ernment or- what was likely to bring hap
piness or true greatness to a generation
or a race of men.
The counting house and the factory
have their uses and their places not In
conspicuous or secondary- Those in con
trol of them are, many of them, possessed
of brains, energy and good sense not to
be despised in counsel. But they show
neither wisdom nor good sense when they
assume to- possess the right or power to
ignore the just and necessary control of
government over all persons and corpora
tions. Pernaps they do not intend to as
sume such a position or to be understood
as doing so, but that they actually do so
assume. and pretend is "written In terms
in the articles referred to. â¢
Such an assumption of unrestrained
power in combinations of capital amounts
to monopolistic socialism confined to its
operators and stockholders. The assump
tion- of such a position and the execution
of the programme now under way can re
sult only in the tendering of an issue that
can ultimately be decided in one way only.
Rich men are ambitious. They want more
power, more wealth and more control.
But others are also ambitious and want
some wealth, some power and some con
trol.
If combinations of capital are beyond
control of governments as now conducted,
and they appear to be at least tending
that way, the inevitable tendency of the
opposition will be toward like combina
tion through public ownership and public
operation, amounting Â»re " long to state
socialism, in which many broad and hon
est men see many dangers to our form
of government, our civilization and our
race. But government must and will b<;
government and ultimately must control.
The question is, shall it control in its
present form or in a form and manner
much less satisfactory to capital and
vested Interests?
Those who love our institutions as they
have been and are (at least in a degree
they are still the same) see little to hope
for in such exhibitions of. superlative con
ceit as the organizers and those in con
trol of the trusts are now furnishing.
Should Not Seek Industrial Control.
The assumption that all government
control is meddling; that all officials who
do not defer without question to the lords
of the "counting house and the factory"
are mischievous meddlers. That all news-
all politicians are demagogues and that
all statesmen are dead, 13 not likely to
settle wisely or well these or any other
problems. Our only hope is that a saner
time and a soberer view will come before
the inevitable other extreme 13 upon us
and our Institutions are Irrevocably anl
injuriously changed. Equality, character
and good government, not monopoly or
socialism, have accumulated the wealth
we enjoy and achieved the position wa
now occupy as a nation and a people.
Suppose we succeed as suggested in be
in" by the trusts "put in indus
trial control of the world," which
is about as sane an Idea as
Monte Cristo's exclamation, "the world
is mine." What would we do with
the industrial control of the world it -wa
had It? "We could remain in control only
by competition with the toil and poverty
and comparatively helplessness of the
world's labor. We may begin such com
petition in pride and conceit but it can
only end In disaster. It can be continued
for a time and for a time only by use of
our superior machinery and our more in
telligent labor, but to assume that other
countries cannot even Imitate us or uso
the same machinery or- copy the ways of
our labor (some of which has been but
recently imported) is too much conceit for
practical business uses.
Trust God and the Constitution.
What we need is to be "put in con
trol" of ourselves and our own govern
ment, protect our own markets, develop
our own resources and protect our own
people from outsiders <nd from each
other- and preserve all that 13 best in our
form of government, laws and civilization
and institutions.
Suppose other countries organize trusts
of their own, we cannot claim to have
copyrighted these peculiarly wise and
beneficent organizations that supply the
place of government, remove competition,
and all other ills and woes at will. So If wo
cease to, have a monopoly in trusts our
commercial supremacy might ba called
seriously in question. Possibly, therefore.
It might be well to continue to be- so 014
fashioned as to put some of our trust in
Almighty Gcd. some in our constitution
and laws and some in our worth and In
tegrity, and not all of it in mere mone
tary wealth in the hands of millionaires
combined under corporations called trnst3.
The matter I should like to impress is
one dear to every thinking American: and
that is that the arrogance and" exactions
cf combined capital are rot likely to do
nearly so much harm in the temporary
exactions it m.n.r extort and obtain as the
inevitable tendency It generates to drive
the masses of the people to the other ex
treme, which other extreme, will be dis
astrous to capital, which would amount
to a temporary calamity only. The- far
graver Injury, however. Is that It will also
work a radical change in our form of gov
ernment and methods of life altogether
injurious and wholly unnecessary unless
the arrosance of organized wealth shall
render it possible and acceptable to the
people as their last choice between two
evils. FRANK IL SHORT.

Borrowing wisdom from Intolerance it
may very truthfully be conceded that
combinations of cap.tal are in a position
to do much of the good claimed and may
do some part of it, and also that they are
likely to do much less good than they
prophesy and not all the harm anticipat
ed by some radical thinkers. It is true
that steam engines, steamships and steam
railroads,^ telegraphs, telephones, electric
transportation and their thousand kin
dred appliances afford opportunities for
beneficial industrial * co-operation and
combination such as never before existed.
That thereby much good can and ought
to be done. That the greater the system
the more perfect should be its operation.
The more direct the course from the raw
material to the hungry consumer the bet
ter the results ought to be and the lower
the price should be. As cited where the
steel trust owns its own mines of coal and
iron, its own ships, its own factories and
railroads it ought to. be able to produce
the best article possible for the least pos
sible price. That It does produce a good
article in a skilled and economical way is
undoubtedly true. That it sells as cheap
as possible to the consumer is not true.
High Salaries and Big Dividends.
That It sells at even a'reasonable profit
can hardly be true, as it seems to be ad
mitted that it sells certain of its products
in foreign markets . much cheaper than in
its own. Its salaries are ridiculously high
and its dividends on actual investments
are exorbitantly large. Mr. Schwab, for
instance. Is "paid $1,000,000 a .year for su
pervising, and is delighted with combina
tions of capital because -it reduces "the
item" of supervision, but since his salary
would pay that of 100 men at $10,000 each
per year, the steel trust seems to have
been more efficient in reducing numbers
than cash. Mr. .Schwab, obviously. not a
foolish man, would hardly get a million
a year as a logician. Mr. Schwab being
a supervisor magnifies the importance of
supervision. Being a* combine, he mag
nifies the advantages and beauties of
combinations. Being in a great trust,; he
magnifies, the benefits of trusts and min
imizes the importance of the functions
of government; in. fact, unconsciously, no
doubt, he infers that government is a
mere side issue that.will do no harm if it
keeps "hands off" of '' trusts. He (Mr.
Schwab) thinks the whole question will
be allowed to work itself out "in the fac
tory", and in the "counting .room." . "The
Iron and steel industry of America is not
apprehensive of antagonistic political ac
tion toward it, either by the people or by
Congress.' 1 Antagonistic interference is
evidently v referred to as anything pre
venting the full control of all questions
involved "in : the factory and counting
room." . ' SSSflfeP^^&gSgjSJfcg

Registrar's Office Opsn Evenings.
A significant commentary upon the
state of affairs that h3s arisen at the
Mint, whether due to Treasury Â¦ Depart
ment official orders or to lack of pre
caution on the part of Superintendent
Leach is afforded by the fact that $47,000,
000 in gold is now stored in the basement
vaults, where previously only silver was
stored. they not being deemed safe
enough for the more precious coin. Upon
the. discovery of the theft this amount of
gold coin In sacks was transferred from
the two cashier's vaults to the basement
vaults, where it is being carefully guard
ed by an extra force of watchmen while
inspection of the treasure proceeds.
Responsibility for the $30,000 stolen will
be difficult to fix. The Treasury Depart
ment will no doubt contend that Superin
tendent Leach's bond must make It good,
and the Superintendent will pass the re
sponsibility along to Cashier Cole. The
two local officials will probably join in
the contention that the fault lies with
the -Treasury Department officials, whose
orders are responsible for the plethora of
coined gold that made the theft of the
$30,000 possible. , â¢'
The inspection of the treasure in the big
vaults went on yesterday from 9 o'clock
In the morning till .4 In the afternoon.
Nearly $4,000,000 was counted and not a
single sack found to be shy of its proper
amount of coin. This inspection will re
quire about ten days yet for its comple
tion. It is not thought that further
thefts v/ill be discovered.
Treasure in Basement Vaults.
The private life of the suspected man Is
being scanned as closely as his conduct
at the Mint. Both phases contain damag
ing evidence, but not the clean-cut sort
that convicts.' Dlmmlck was surprised In
the act, practically, of imitating the sig
nature of Superintendent Leach. He is
known to have taken money from the pay
envelopes of employes, making restitution
at later dates. He made remarks to
Cashier Cole that seemed to be "feelers"
put out cautiously In search of a confed
erate in a . plot to loot the vaults. A
mass of evidence has been uncovered
that points the finger of suspicion at Dlm
mick. But apparently that Is all. No one
saw him taking treasure from the vault;
none of It has been found in his posses
sion, and no sack' or tag or other bit of
evidence has been found to give a claw
to the disposition made of the loot. Fel
low employes of Dimmlck predict, while
assuming his guilt, that he will never be
convicted.
Director Roberts, Superintendent Leach,
Secret Service Agent Hazen, Cashier
Cole and Chief Clerk Dimmlck were
closeted together during most of the day's
investigations. Charles Waltz, the lock
expert, was present during several hours
of the afternoon and it is believed that his
reports on the combinations of the locks
to the cashier's working vault were dam
aging to Dimmlck.' Waltz was employed
to determine whether or not Cashier Cole
changed the combination to a degree that
the chief clerk, who previously held the
combination, .would not be able to open
the vault doors. .
Experiments by Lock Expert.
Dlmmlck jj remains at liberty, but the
surveillance of secret service men is not
relaxed for a moment and flight, It is al
leged, would be impossible for him. In
justice to him it must be said that he has
shown no disposition to shrink from the
investigation, but those aniong the Mint
employes who are convinced of his guilt
say his attitude la due to confidence that
convicting evidence against him cannot be
obtained. .
The longest session yet held of Mint of
ficials and secret service men was that
of yesterday. Beginning at 10 o'clock, It
lasted, with but an hour for lunch at
noon, till almost 7 o'clock in the evening.
When It was over 'Chief Clerk Dlmmlck
bore the look of a man who had been un
der fire and who realized that he had not
came out of it with credit. On the
other hand. Director of the Mint Roberts,
Superintendent Leach and Cashier Cole
evidently felt pleased and almost elated
over the results of the day's investigation.
"While the men who are probing into the
mystery are keeping their own counsel,
there are numerous Indications that the
meshes of the law are tightening about
the chief clerk and that the Investigators
no longer fear that the thief, whoever he
may be, will escape detection.

A. j\ mence Its sessions, the head
quarters at Mechanics' Pavilion
have already assumed an air of intense
activity. To accommodate the hundreds
of delegates who have already arrived, the
registration and entertainment commit
tees remained at their poets all day yes
terday. It was the intention of the local
leaguers to have sent representatives to
receive the delegates when they stepped
from the overland trains, but their early
arrival disrupted all the plans. Imme
diately after registering yesterday the
major part cf the visitors left on excur
sion trains to visit points of interest in
various parts of the State. They will not
return until the opening of the conven
tion
The registration and entertainment
committees have already established
themselves at Mechanics' Pavilion and
their example will be followed to-day by
aJl the rest of the executive force.
The work of transforming the interior
cf the Pavilion into a magnificent audi
torium is steadily progressing. The
framework for the placing- of from 8000 to
8000 chairs is about completed and it is
expected that the seats will all be in po
sition to-day.
It has been stated by the railroad au
thorities as a conservative estimate that
there are now 23.000 excursionists on their
way to this city and that as many more
are expected.
Deppjte the great' benefit that the Ep
worth Leagu- convention.* with its thou-
Fands,of visitors, will confer upon this
city and Etate. the subscriptions are still
coming in very slowly. The managers of
the convention need nothing now to insure
\
The New York special train, which Is
scheduled to arrive at Denver this morn-
Ing, is bearing more than 150 delegates.
On Saturday and Monday the heaviest
traffic on the Ogden route is expected.
There will be at least twenty excursion
trains and in the neighborhood of fifty
extra carp.
It is estimated by the railroad compa
nies that they have already transported
700 delegates to the city and that within
the next two days the number will be
swelled to 5000. The main body of dele
gates however, will not arrive until Mon
day or Tuesday. From all over the Union
come reports each day of Increases in the
army which is on the way. The local
agents of the railroad companies have
been informed that immense numbers of
visitors are coming from New England
and the Middle and Southern States.
Word was received that 400 delegates and
their friends departed on a special train
bearing the frame Golden Gate from Phil
adelphia yesterday morning. There are
four other special trains speeding from
Philadelphia. carrying at least 500
leaguers. They will leave Denver this
morning and arrive in Ogden early to
morrow.
Delegates on the Way.
The representation by the Humboldt
farmers of their giant trees is about com
plete. So perfect has the resemblance
been made that it is almost impossible
to distinguish the imitation from the
original.
The Stanford University booth, decked
In a brilliant hue of red, will contain an
exhibit of the results of the State's edu
cational advancement.
Across the aisle leading to the booths
will be placed an arch of welcome, deco
rated lavishly with bunting, various
colored streamers and a wealth of beauti
ful blossoms and foliage. During the
night this arch will be brilliantly illumi
nated with electric lights. ; Â¦
In the line of displays the two principal
transcontinental railroad companies are
both striving after the picturesque and
unique. The Santa Fe will have as its
headquarters a booth representing one of
the old California missions, with its roof
of ti'.es and its walls of old gray stone.
As a historical representation this dis
play will be one of the features of the
convention.
The Southern Pacific Company will en
deavor to display the products, resources
and picturesque scenery of all California.
This display is being devised by Wiiliam
Murray of the company's information bu
reau. "When it is completed it will be un

hearsal is scheduled for Tuesday after
noon. The singing of the grand chorus,
which is the largest ever assembled on
the coast, accompanied by the magnificent
Stanford organ, will be one of the most
memorable features of the Epworth
League Convention.
The section of the gallery which has
been devoted to the booths is rapidly be

destructive of these is Cancer, which finds the
greatest number of its victims among the children*
and grand-children of those whose blood was tainted
with this dreadful malady. You may carry this poison in the blood for years, but
as the vital powers begin to wane a slight bruise or cut, wart or mole, sore or '
pimple may develop into Cancer. From middle life to old age is the time when
the slumbering poison is most apt to break out, a sore or ulcer often degenerating
into Cancer, and Tumors become more progressive and ulcerate through the skin,
the sharp, shooting pains causing the taost intense suffering.
The Cancer patient naturally grows despondent as one after another the usual,
remedies fail, and the sore shows no sign of. healing. 'The impurities that have'
been accumulating in the system, perhaps for generations, cannot be eliminated nor .
the poisoned blood made pure by salves, washe3 and plasters. The proper treatment
is to purify and build up the blood, remove the cause, when the sore or ulcer heals."

A New Departure in
San Francisco Shoe Selling
The world-famed Regal Shoes are now on sale in this city.
The Store at the corner of Geary and Stockton Streets is the only
one West of the Missouri River where shoes are sold direct from tannery
to consumer.
This is. the Regal method. The manufacturers of Regal Shoes own
and maintain retail stores in all the principal cities of the country. The
San -Francisco store is the latest to be established.
Shoe's sold by ordinary methods are handled many times unnecessarily.
This handling costs money. It makes a shoe of the same value as the Regal
cost more. It makes a shoe sold at the Regal price worth much less. The
Regal method eliminates this handling. It saves to the shoe wearer all these
unnecessary profits. It .gives to the shoe wearer $3.50 worth of real
shoe value for $3.50. It gives a shoe the equal in every respect of any $6.00
shoe sold by ordinary methods.
All styles of Regal Shoes sell at the one price^ â $3*50. The styles
are exact duplicates of the patterns now made by the high priced custom
bootmakers of London, Paris and New York.
Regals are made in 162 styles and 121 sizes â a style for every taste
âa fit for every natural foot.
There are 26 styles of Oxfords, (low cut) the popular Summer shape.

CHICAGO. " July 10.â Influenced by strength
in coarse Grains, wheat opened firm, and on
light offers the market continued to rule firm
throughout the day. Trade was. moderate, the
crowd continuing to favor corn . and oats, as
promising better results to buyers tinder ex
iatir.s hot weather conditions. Demand was
mostly by shorts, while commission houses
were the sellers. September opened %c to %c
higher at 64VÂ»c to 64%c, and advanced stead
ily, closing %c higher at 64%c, the high point
of the day.,
Exceedingly hot temperatures over Â»a large
section of the country created excitement in
tho corn pit at the opening. There was an
enormous demand both local and on outside
account early, and it was hard to execute
orders, as scarcely any corn was on the mar
ket, and what was for sale was held by thosÂ»
waiting to take profits. Heavy realizing on
the â¢ advance caused a sharn decline, but en
renewed buying pries rallied again. Septem
ber corn closed %@%c higher at 49%c.
There was about" as bier a market for oats
as for corn. Weather conditions were the bull
influences, together with sympathy with corn.
September closed %@%c higher at 31%c.
Provisions opened steady with a firm under
tone. The damare to corn and oats by heat
and the drying up of pastures had a, stimulat
ing effect. . September pork closed SOc higher,
lard 13c higher and ribs liic higher.
The leading futures ranged as "follows:

was very generally affected, the Eastern trunk
lines sharing in the fullest of the day's weak
ness. ' Indications show that speculative buyers
of the recent past and even Ions time holders
who refused to be shaken out by the May
panic were among the sellers. The growing
conviction that there would be no sufficient
ease of money before the fall demand for. mov
ing the crops to Invite active speculation was
borne in upon speculators who were holding
large lots in anticipation of a midsummer buy
ing movement, and they threw over stocks in
large volume under the conviction that money
conditions might .be worse before they are
better again. - ,
The gold export was the most important fae
tor in causing this feeling. The fact that in
terior hanks are already feeling the demand
for money from the agricultural centers is an
indication that that demand on New York will
come unusually early this year. A possible
source of relief was by imports of gold from
abroad and foreign money markets have cal
culated upon supplying gold for such a move
ment. An outward movement of gold after the
July settlements abroad and when exchange
bills against future payments of grain are al
ready in large supply in the New York mar
ket comes as a shock. Probably the unsettled
financial conditions in Germany explain the
movement, which must be a special one, al
though the plans of the Austro-Hungarian Gov
ernment to attract gold for currency purposes
may have its part.
The announcement of the engagement found
the market well above last night on a con
tinuation of yesterday's recovery, but liquida
tion set in at once and was continued in in
creasing volume until the close, which was
active and* weak at about the lowest The net
declines in the market leaders reached such fig
urs as the following: Rock Island 8, St. Paul
a%, Atchison 5%. Union Pacific o'i, Missouri
Pacific b%, Kansas and Texas preferred 1%,
Louisville and Nashville 4%. Iowa Central 5,
do preferred 7% and Chicago and Eastern Illi
nois 6. .
In other prominent active stocks, including
some of the Eastern trunk lines and leading
specialties, prices are between 2% and 4 points
lower qn the day. The steel stocks are about
two points lower.
The unbroken drouth in the corn belt and an
effort to discount an expected favorable show
ing of the Government's monthly crop report
were elements in the weakness of the market,
but were not sufficient to account for the gen
eral weakness Fhown.
The railroad bond market was -fairly active

The stock market to-day was much more
cheerful than yesterday, but it was rather a
reaction from weakness than anything really
specific In the way of improvement. Business
was only moderate, eave In the American de
partment, which was more active than lately.
The strength and buoyancy exhibited in New
Y.ork yesterday decidedly demoralized the local
bears and to-day there was a 'fresh crop of
bulls, particularly in Atchison. The Continent
was a slight seller only. New York's buying
gave an early boost to Louisville, which was
talked of as going on a 6 per cent basis. On
the official opening Atchison was sold heavily,
causing a flat finish, Louisville and Nashville
alona maintaining strength. The weakness was
partly due to talk about a Western heat wave.
Money ruled steady. â¢

NEW YORK. July 10.â The feature ! of the
metal market to-day was the heavy decline
of Â£12 In the price of spot tin in London, the
closing- figures being Â£123. F"tures declined
Â£2, to Â£115 5s. This great break- in prices for
spot tin was due, it is said, to the miscalcu
lation of the clique as to the necessities of
spot buyers. There was no demand for spot
tin. The local market was influenced to some
extent by the break abroad, and the spot price
at New York was marked down 75 points with
the closing price standing at $27 25Â§27 75, and
ihe tone was weak at the close.
Copper was inactive here, but nominally un
changed, with lake quoted at 17c and casting
at 16%c. The London market was 3s 9d bet
ter, closing with spot at Â£63 and futures at
Â£G7 Ss 9d. ,
Lead in New York was dull and unchanged,
with 4%c quoted, while London was Is 3d lower
at Â£12 5s.
V Pigiron warrants, quiet, $9 50@10.
The English markets were dull, with Glasgow
closing at 51s and Middlesboro at 44s lVÂ£d.
Spelter, dull and unchanged at %Z 90@3 93.
Nciv York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, July 10.â Much of the advance
recently scored in cotton futures was wiped
out to-day. The close was easy at a net de
cline of 10 to 19 points, with July leuding the
decline'.

of scoureds and crossbreds sold readily. Falk

London Wool Sales.
The sales since January 1 amount to 114,852,600
pounds, against 70,272,600 pounds for the corre
sponding time last year.
The sales for the week in Boston amounted
to 3.670,500 pounds domestic and 212,200 pounds
foreign, making a total of 3,882.700 pounds,
against a total of 6.195,000 for ihe previous week
and a total of 1,316,000 pounds for the corre
sponding week last year.
Another fact which has also tended to im
part strength to the market Is the continued
firmness in the Territories. Quite a lot of de
sirable medium stock is reported to have sold
at 14c. Indications are that wools will be
cleaned up as thoroughly in Montana as they
were In Idaho, and as they have been in most
of the Territories this season.
The wool market has been less active the
past week, the intervention of a holiay, com
bined with the dull and unfavorable opening at
the London markets, naturally tending to re
strict. Reports received since the opening of
the London sales indicate some improvement.
The trade is feeling better than at the begin
ning of the week under review and this feel
ing has been greatly strengthened by the tenor
of the reports from the goods market.

NEW RAILROAD OFFICERS
ASSUME THEIR DUTIES
ntzhugh and Herbert Get Into Har
ness and Settle Down to
Hard Work.
The two new appointees of the South
ern Pacific Company took charge of thÂ«ir
offices yesterday, and spent most of the
business hours receiving callers and get
ting their work into shape.
E. H. Fitzhugh has taken the place
formerly occupied by H. E. Huntingdon.
He said he was not long enough in the
office to make any definite statement of
his plarts yesterday, nor would he defi
nitely define the limits of his duties and
authority. That he will soon make him
self felt in the company is certain, for
from all appearances he will be the pro
noun of the president and will act in his
name In a great many ways that call for
high authority and discretion.
J. M. Herbert installed himself In Mr.
Flllmore's rooms yesterday morning and
immediately dug into the routine of the
office. He will spend a few days in get
ting himself into the swing of the busi
ness, and then will commence the sys
tematic touring of the divisions, nor will
he stop until he has traveled over every
bit of track the company possesses. He
will start on this tour probably next Mon
day, and will take it in sections, return
ing to San Francisco at the end of the
week, whenever possible.
Mr. Herbert said â¢ yesterday that he
found the system and methods of his new
office practically similar to the routines
of other roads, and as he has served as
manager of several railroad properties he
finds himself fitting into the new placo
easily and without delay.
DYEB RENAULT TAKES
DOSE OF CARBOLIC ACID
Suffering- From an Incurable Disease,
He Puts an End to His
Existence, i ,
Louis J. Renault, a dyer, doing business
at 330% Tenth street, committed suicide
yesterday by taking carbolic acid.
[ He was found dead In his room by his
! daughter, Mathilde. Renault was 61
! years old and a native of France. He
had been suffering for c long time with
valvular disease of the heart and lately
had ben very despondent and erratic In
his actions.
Evidence at the Inquest yesterday
showed that Renault had been practical
ly insane and irresponsible for several
months past.
The jury brought In a verdict that he
had Â¦ committed suicide while temporarily
Insane. , . Â¦ , , -
At 10 o'clock an alarm was sent Jn from
the same box, 39, and the firemen had to
renew their work. It appears that a piece
of oakum lodged in the rafters and a
spark from the original fire ignited the
inflammable stuff. The chemical engine
extinguished the blaze in quick time. The
damage to the building and contents is
said to amount to about $3000.
A fire broke out in the building .used as
a storehouse by the Pacific Refining and
Roofinf Company and the Guadalupe As
phalt Company, at Sixteenth and Missis
sippi -streets, last night and caused a loss
of $1000. A second alarm was sounded, but
the department got the fire under control
before it had gained much headway. A
nearby shed, in Â¦Â¦which was stored a large,
amount of pitch and other inflammable
material, was paved by the prompt action
of the firemen. â¢ Â¦
Spontaneous combustion caused a lively
blaze in the shipwright shop of George G.
Rundle at 209 Steuart street at 5 o'clock
last night. The oakum and tarred ropes
stored in the place, made excellent fuel
for the fire and the department had a
hard task subduing the flames. The
building was badly burned and the loss to
Mr. Rundle te said to have been con
siderable. C. E. Boudrou. who kept a
junk shop in the same building, suffered
slight damage. The families of Mrs;
Teamer and Mrs. Williams, who occupied
the upstairs portion of the house, suffered
considerable loss.

Cornelius Jurey. formerly a member of
Company I, First California Volunteers,
died at his home, 1508 Bryant avenue,
Tuesday. He will be buried in Calvary
Cemetery to-morrow morning.
Jurey was but 23 years of age and was
a most popular young man. He served
with Captain Richter's company during
all the engagements participated in by the
California regiment. He -was presented
with a testimonial and medal by the
colonel of the First for conspicuous gal
lantry at San Pedro Macati. In the face
of a heavy fire he crossed a field and re
covered a great deal of ammunition which
his regiment was compelled to leave be

CHICAGO, July 10.â John A. Hin3ey,
former president of the board of control
of the endowment rank of the Knights cf
Pythias, appeare'd before the Supreme
Lodge to-day and admitted the report
submitted yesterday, to be. true." The re
port shows that the affairs of the endow
ment rank under Hinsey's management
drifted into a practical insolvency. Of
$500,000 invested under Hinsey's direction,
nearly two-thirds went into enterprises
which rendered them unavailable to pay,
death claims. Other funds went into
channels for which there, is no account
ing.
The former president of the Board of
Control declared that he had done his
best to keep the treasury of the endow
ment rank in a sound condition, but the
death Â¦ claims had mounted up, invest
ments had turned out failures and it had
been necessary to overdraw the rank's
account at the bank..' , ' .
The report which was compiled by the
present Board of Control, excepting Hin
sey and the Insurance Commissioners of
Illinois and Connecticut, does not charge
Hlnsey and others with Â» misusing the
funds, but simply states that they were
misused. To reporters Hinsey. said: .

"Secret Service," at the Grand Opera

the stirring Gillette play, every character
in It being filled most satisfactorily.

best advantage. It is one, of the best
things we have seen here.

Special Dispatch to The Can.
SAN BERNARDINO, July 10.-N. TT.
Lamb, 30 years of age, occupies a padded
ceWat the County Hospital, where he was
placed this morning pending an examina
tion" by Superior Judge Campbell on an
insanity charge. Lamb created a sen
sation yesterday afternoon at Redlands,
where he suddenly became a raving
maniac. His misfortune is due, it is. said,
to the excessive use of cigarettes.
Â¦ Lamb at 4 o'clock yesterday entered
the home of Mrs. Sarah Watson, 3OSV3
Orange street, and informed .that lady
that for some time he had been in love
with her pretty 19-year-old daughter,
Miss Mabel .Watson, and was now ready
to take her to Boston, where she would
be provided for In a luxurious manner.
The madman was determined in his
Â¦wishes and made a thorough search of the
premises. Mrs. Watson was thoroughly
frightened, but sÂ«ceede\ In hiding Misa
Watson in the dining-room. Failing to
find her, Lamb left the place.
The maniac returned an hour later,
more determined than ever to take Miss
Watson. This time, by a clever ruse,
Mrs. Watson got the stranger out on the
street and. hÂ© disappeared. The police
were notified and after hunting several
hours for Lamb they abandoned further
search.
At 11 o'clock last night Lamb appeared
on a bicycle at a cigar store. He imme
diately took possession, and, after filling
his pockets with cigars and cigarettes,
opened several boxes and passed them
among the bystanders. Owing to his
threatening, attitude no one ventured to
arrest him. His next escapade was at
the Casa Loma Hotel, where he tried to
abduct a waitress. At midnight the
police succeeded in placing him in jail.
Lamb is a carpenter and has been a
resident of Redlands but three months.
No one knows whence he came.

PURE FOOD ACT
A DEAD LETTER
Former Senator Withing
ton Says It Is Now .
Worthless.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO. July 10.â The. Union to
morrow, will print an interview with D. L.
Withlngton, former State Senator from
this district; who, in the 1895 term of the
State Legislature, fathered the bill which
is and has been known as the pure food
bill and which the Senator â¢declares was
knocked out by the adoption of the report
of the Code Commissionersâ A. C. Free
man, W. C. Van . Fleet and George J.
Denis â which has been incorporated in the
laws of 1901 and which became of effect
and in force the first of this month.
The pure food law approved by Gover
nor Budd on March 2S. provides In its first
section: "No person shall, within this
State, manufacture for sale", offer for sale
or sell any drug or article of food which
is adulterated within the meaning of this
act." Another and separate section of the
law fixes punishment, together with
added penalties. There was, moreover, a
provision in the old law that the provis
ions of the act should not apply "to mix
tures or compounds recognized as ordi
nary articles or ingredients of articles of
food, if each and every package sold or
offered for sale is distinctly labeled as
.mixtures or compounds, with the name
and per cent of each ingredient therein,
and are not injurious to health."
The new law of the Code Commission,
according to the Senator, Is so carefully
hedged around with phrases which almost
preclude a conviction under it, that there
is no chance, of ever getting a conviction.
The new law Is section 3S3 of the code
and provides that "every person who
knowingly sells, or keeps, or offers for
sale (the manufacturing is entirely left
out) or otherwise disposes of any article
of food, drink, drug or medicine, knowing
(the first "knowingly" seemed not enough
to protect the breaker of the law) that the
same is adulterated or has been tainted,
decayed or otherwise unwholesome or unfit
to-be eaten or druntf, with intent to per
mit the same to be eaten or drunk, is
guilty, etc."
"The commissioners," says the father,
of the bill, "seem not satisfied with pro
tecting the man who breaks the law once,
but they, have to do it three or four
times over. The District Attorney has
to prove knowledge on the part of the
offender twice, but he must prove an in
tent also. He must prove that the fellow
knows he' has it, that he knows that it is
adulterated and that he intends that \t
shall : 'be eaten, three strong protections
for*tlie offender. Not only that, but the
section; .providing that the adulterated
food,s which are not Injurious shall be
labeled is entirely stricken from the law
and the act of 1S95 has been so disfigured
that it is of no effect whatever. A con
viction under it is utterly impossible, and
that which the people of the Bast would
have been willing to pay at least $50,000 to
have done has been done by the Code
Commissioners without any one who was
interested in the first measure knowing
it."
W. C. Miller Attempts to Strangle
INSANE PRISONER TEIES
TO KILL HIS CELLMATE
William Bauer in the City-
Prison.
W. C. Miller, who is under sentence of
six months for carrying a concealed
weapon, became Insane in the" City Prison
last night and started to strangle William
Bauer, his cellmate. The latter's screams
attracted â¢ the attention of Corporal
Heggerty and Turnkeys Mahoney
and Murphy. Rushing to the cell they
seized Miller Just in time to prevent him
from making Bauer a subject for the
Coroner. As it was evident that the fel
low is deranged he was sent to the Re
ceiving Hospital and locked up in the de
tention ward. . . i
FENCING OF THE BANGE â¢
THE IMPORTANT QUESTION
DENVER, July 10.â The most Important
business transacted by the board of di
rectors of the American Cattle Growers'
Association at its meeting in this city,
which ended to-day, was to pass a reso
lution recommending that the next con
vention . eliminate f roin the constitution
the assessment feature of raiding money
to , defray extraordinary expenses of the
association, which has proved unpopular.
â¢ The board is working to preserve a
status quo on. the range fencing question
until. the next Congress meets and it is
seen ,what that body will do on the leas
ing question. . President Lusk will appoint
a committee to draft a leasing bill. The
board will meet in this city again on the
first -Monday in November., . ; â¢Â¦Â¦-.- .
! The estimates made by the Board of
Public Works for improvements to the
! Fremont and Buena Vista School build
! ings subjected that body to criticism at a
meeting of the Board of Education yesr
terday. The first named board sent in a
communication that the lowest bid for the
: Fremont- School was $12,755, for the'Fre^
mont Primary $1340 and for the Buena
Vista $15,2?5. These figures were consid
erably above the estimates made by the
J Board of Works' engineers and the bids
were recommended for rejection. Since
they are not within the estimates, the
bills could not be legally paid.
j Superintendent Webster took a fling at
the Board of Works, which he said had
I certainly erred In Its figures, and he could
not understand why its estimates had
failed. Webster joined in the recommen
: dation for rejection of the bids.
i As a result of the error in estimates
: the board will be compelled to rent out
: side Quarters for the accommodation of
pupils in the district where the schools
named are located, as the improvements
may have to 'be made while school is in
session.
Silas White, principal of the Spring Val
ley School, asked to be placed on the re
tired list and his application was referred
I to the Rctirement*"Committee.
j The registration of Emma F. Liebold, a
I teacher in the Hancock Grammar School,
was accepted.
A. H. McDonald, principal of the Lin
coln School, recalled his resignation and
if the board agrees he will retain his posi
tion.
Director Denman opposed the applica
tion of Miss Susan Kingsbury, sister of
Deputy Superintendent Kingsbury, for
one year's leave of absence on the ground
that no teacher should get a year's leave
unless she has been in the department
for ten years. The application was
granted.
Leaves of absence were granted to Miss
Ruth G. Campbell. Miss L. C. McNear and
Charles L,. Turner, each for six months.

fake orders have been given them by an
unknown swindler who has been posing
as F. W. Dohrmann, the well known local
merchant. The swindler's methods have
been simple and easy. His mode of pro
cedure has been to visit the large fac
tories, inquire as to the orders on file
from the Sen Francisco house of which
he was posing as the head, discuss the
business knowingly, augment or vary the
order and incidentally make a borrow of
from $100 to $300. A draft for $300 on an
Eastern bank, bearing the. forged name
of F. W. Dohrmann, made telegrams of in
quiry fly back and forth from the East
ern metropolis to this citj^ and- resulted
in the case being placed in the hands of
the New York police.
Mr. Dohrmann has absolutely no clew
as to who the man can be who appears to
be eo thoroughly conversant with the
business of his firm and the crockery
business In general. No man has been
discharged for the past two years from his
house, and this fact coupled with the in
telligence that the fictitious Dohrmann ap
pears to possess about the intimate busi
ness of the firm makes the case very mys
tifying. Considerable correspondence has
passed between Mr. Dohrmann and the
Eastern firms, who have been swindled,
and this correspondence contains much
interesting matter. One firm complains
of a $2000 order which the glib impostor
gave while he borrowed $300, and
another firm writes pathetically of a car
load of goods shipped at "Mr. Dohr
mann's" order, and which the firm man
aged to stop at Columbus. Ohio.
The description of the swindler which
the Eastern manufacturers have sent out
hero is as follows: "Five feet nine inches
in height, and weighing probably 150
pounds. Dark complexion, black mustache
and hair slightly tinged with gray. Good
teeth and dark eyes. Good appearance,
pleasing address and thoroughly posted
on business affairs of the firm of Nathan,
Dohrmann & Co. Also knows all about
the trade and jobbing and retail prices."

Frank had a petty quarrel to-day with
Mr. Einstein in the orchard, over ranch
details. Returning to tne house he wrote
a note mentioning the trouble and con
cluded with the sentence: "All is over;
I have done it." When Einstein reached
the house he found Frank dying. Ein
stein rushed out to where the workmen
were engaged and asked some one to go
for medical aid. When they arrived at
the house, however, Frank was dead.
Emanuel Frank retired from business in
this city in 1883. He was at one tlmo a
partner in the wholesale liquor house r-f
Braeg & Frank, doing business on Cali
fornia street. Later the firm name was
changed to Frank. Dallem & Co., and still
later to Gilman, Walker & Co. Mr. Frank
twas about 63 years of age.
FALLBROOK. July 10.â Emanuel M.
Frank, part owner and manager of the
fine Red Mountain ranch four miles east
of here, committed suicide at 10:30 o'clock
this morning: by taking poison.
Frank, was a German Jew, about 60
years of age, and was formerly a who'e
sale liquor dealer of San Francisco. For
the past three years he had lived at the
ranch with his partner and second cou
sin, Jacob E. Einstein, <iiso of San Fran
cisco. - The ranch has lately been involved
in much litigation. This, in connection
with other private business troubles,'wor
ried Frank. To add to his despondency
he recently became afflicted by a car
buncle on the neck, which ho believed
was a cancer.

The works are located quite a distance

by the breaking of the belt which con

to run the clumsy vehicle back to a point

passengers were to operate the pole.
The wagon had moved only a few feet
when the brake blocks flew out and it

morning in the bar of the Oxford Hotel.
The funerals were held within an hour of

Quite a number of union -restaurants have
Shut Off Meat Supply.
Â¦When the Journeymen Butchers' Union dis
tributed the j union meat card I to Insure Us
members of the permanency of the shorter
work day recently gained and to 'stop the dis
charge of its members for the only reason that
they were members of the union, the boss
butchers shut off the meat from butcher shops
displaying the union card: The Rtrlke- thus
forced ur>on the journeymen resulted disas
trously to the Butchers' Union. Ths odds on
the sid; of the employers were too great. The
Butchers' Union thus jveakened, the boss
butchers went back to their old game. They
issued the ukase that no more meat shall be
sold to restaurants displaying the union' card.
The y are enforcing this ukase to the beat of
their ability. Interviews had by committees
of the Labor Council ' with Rodolph . of â¢ Miller
& Lux, with H. Moffat and H. Levy, repre
senting the wholesale butchers. and holding the
key to the situation by controlling the meat
Rupply. proved futile. These men were fully
Informed of the conditions existing in the res
taurants and what the success. of their policy
meant to the several thousand men and women
compelled to work in restaurants of this city.
But Mr. Rodolph of Miller & Lux, the heavy
man, in the committee, cared, nothing for the
miÂ«*fyÂ»/ind degradation of these unfortunates.
The t ollowlnr circular letter, dated July 1,
was sent to the boss butchers of this city;
"Dear Sir: Please take notice that.it haa been
determined by ' the "Wholesale Butchers and
the Jobbers* and Retailers' Association of . San
Francisco to end the strife between restaurant
proprietors of San Francisco and place all on
a footing of equality. It has been deemed ad
visable ! that they . all should remove their
union cards. You are requested to discon
tinue doing business, with such establishments
as refuse to accede to this demand. By order
of executive committee."
Right from the start of this fight the boss
butchers .were prepared to come into it by
shutting off meat from union restaurants, for
in j-pitc of the attitude of the Employers' Asso
ciation fruite a number of restaurant em
ployers acreed .to . give their employes union
conditions. The Journeymen butchers at that
time s;ared the boss butchers off by threat of
a strike if they were forced to cut meat only
for non-union houses. For over three days the
oyster companies absolutely refused oysters to
union restaurants and only the threat^of a
boycott by the Labor Council forced thes^
companies to again supply union houses. The
Cooks' and Waiters' Alliance continued to gain
ground, but the boss butchers only awaited
their opportunity to punish their employes for
attempting to balk them In, their design to
disrupt the Cooks' and Waiters' Alliance.
tice of the moderate- demands of their help
slgnilied their willingness to grant these, be
ing assured that with the aid of the union card
â this cuarante* or humane working condl
tior.sâthey would get sufficient additional
trade to offset the unfair competition of their
neighbors who refused to grant better condi
tions to their help. Then, backed by the work
of the unions and the aid of the fair-minded
public, very soon the unfair restaurants would
see that it paid to run union houses and would
also grant union conditions to their employes.
All of this would have been accomplished
Â¦without strlkâ¬Â« and boycotts, just as it was
done tbrouch the union In the case of the
2CC0 laundry workers in this city, if it had
not been for the Kmployers' Association, which
issued its fiat that the restaurants and hotels
of this city must not concede the trade rules
of the Cooks' and "Waiters' Alliance. Through
promisj of financial i support aÂ«d through
threats of withholding supplies bf all kinds if
the hotels and restaurants were placed under
union conditions a large number of restau
rant keepers were gathered into the Restau
rant Employers' Association, and the fight be,
ean on May 1. .
so far successfully stood off' the bow butchers
and still display the union card.
The folio-wing circular letter, dated July 3,
shows the opposition the boss butchers arÂ«

John Goetz, a baker, of Crockett, filed a
petition in. insolvency yesterday in the
United States District Court: He owes
$1453 16 and he ha3 SS27 assets.
After making this recitation, Mrs. Bell
asks that she be given judgment against
Ashe for the sum of $23,000, the difference
between the alleged value of the jewels
and the sum he returned to her, $12,000.
and that he be adjudged guilty of fraud
and imprisoned until the debt is paid.
"Mr. Ashe, the defendant, advised me
to place the jewels in his hands for safe
keeping. Believing what he said was true
and wishing to save the diamonds, I
placed them in the possession of the de
fendant. Subsequently he took the jew
els to New York and later informed me
that he had sold them. Though he ad
mitted having received $15,000 for the jew
els, he only paid into my hands the sum
of $12,000. Since the sale of the jewels the
defendant has refused to make an ac
counting of the sale of the jewels and
upon information and belief this plaintiff
alleges that the defendant either received
$35,000. the value of the jewels, or con
verted a large portion of the same to his
own use."
"On May 24, 1899, R. Porter Ashe, who
was then acting: as my attorney, availed
himself of his relations as my attorney
and represented that certain persons were
seeking to have me declared Incompetent.
He was aware of the fact that I had In
my possession diamonds and jewels val
ued at $35,000, and he Informed me that
the persons who were seeking to have me
declared incompetent would also endeavor
to get possession of the jewels and con
vert them to their own use.

Labor Council Statement.
At the- meeting of the executive com
mittee of the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil held last night the following review of
the local labor situation was adopted:
The Employers' Association, -true to its pol
icy of attempting to disrupt the trades unions,
and to have only servile labor In this city, has
ordered the . wholesale and retail butchers to
Interfere In the cooks' and -waiters' strike. Res
taurants displaying the union card are being
refused meat and threatened that if the card
is not surrendered within a certain data their
meat BUj>Dly will be shut off for a definite or
indefinite period. And the employing- butchers
boast of this action and glory In their power
to rum business men who refuse to obey their
mandates.
The s-Dokesmen of the Employers' Association
have again and again accused the trades unions
or "'dictation. '* or of "trying to run an em
ployer's business." "What should this tyranni
cal exercise of power now displayed by the boss
butchers be called? Is any business man safe
once this policy of Oie wholesalers and jobbers
is established In this city? In view of the well
known fact tliat the agents of the Steel Trust,
the Meat Trust and other trusts are the ruling
spirits of the Employers' Association, commer
cial ruin and vasjtalae-e to the East are the in
evitable results of euch a policy.
The trades unions s=o far are the only parties
fighting openly this commercial feudalism.
How Ions will It take the still Independent
merchants to realize the position they are
thrust into? It can only be hoped for the ben
efit of the city that the aggressive tactics ot
the Employers' Association and its agents will
Quickly arouse to action thÂ» citizens of San
Francisco -who still dare to assert independence.
Leads Girls to Life of Shame.
I>et -us briefly review the cooks' and -wait
ers' fight; its various phases throw a Etrong
light en the tactics of the Employers' Asso
ciation. The cooks and waiters of this city
formed a union to better tuejr conditions. They
were driven to this to save themselves from
moral and physical ruin. Prior to the strike
men and women were compelled to work seven
days a. week from twelve to eighteen hours per
da^ in the restaurants and hotels of this citr.
And this unmerciful grind went on year In
and year out. Every student of human nature
knows the results. Many a strong and virtuous
girl, aftÂ«r a year or so of such labor, lost
her health and with It came moral degenera
tion. The hotels and restaurants of our city
are the best recruiting grounds for the houses
of ill fame. And let society throw no stones at
these unfortunates who fell exhausted by the
Â¦wayside. Society itself t3 responsible for al
lowing these conditions to continue in the ho
tels and restaurants. It Is society's duty to
check the gTeed of Individuals. From the ho
tels and restaurants come also a rich harvest
of male criminals. â¢ It can't be otherwise when
mm are worked thus.
The trades union stepped In and reached out
it* helping hand to the slaves of the dining
room and kitchen. Discouraged by past failures
the response at first vras slow, ' but earnest
and hard work at last gathered about 2800 men
and women under the folds of the Cooks' and
Walters' Alliance. In, due time trade rules
were adopted and presented to the employers
And what were these trade rules? Stripped of
minor details, it was simply a request for one
day's rest in seven (the employers to select the
day of rest) and for a working day of ten
hours for waiters and twelve hours for cooks
The employment of union hÂ»lp and the displav
of the union card were simply methods, used
throughout the length and breadth of our coun
try, to Insure the permanency of union condi
tions once acquired. There was nothing in the
trade rules taking away from the employer the
right to run his business. He still could hire
and discharge whom he pleased, taking his pick
from the 2000 members of the union.

attempting to act in the matter of asettle
ment of the strike of the machinists and
allied branches of the Industry announc
ing that the local organization has full
power to settle this matter. The mem
bers of the Metal Trades Association will
be notified of this action and probably be
fore the end of the week, a settlement may
be reached. It is generallr understood
both in labor and other circles that this is
the mission to the ft>ast of Thomas Ii
Wilson, one of the vice presidents of the
International Association cf Machinists.
Xeither the leaders of the strikers nor
the members of the Metal Trades Asso
ciation will directly admit this as a fact,
but all indications point to a closing of the
strike at the end of the present weslc.
The Fulton Engineering and Ship Bufid
ing Works claims that it has secured a
large number of men from the interior
and the East and will resume work at

The conciliatory committee of the Fed
eration of Improvement Clubs appointed
at the meetins held on Tuesday night
called on the representatives of the Metal
Trades Association in the morning- and at
the headquarters of the Iron Trades
Council during the noon hour. The firtt
question propounded by the representa
tives of the Metal Trades Association
Â¦was: Â¦Â» - â¢:
"Have the local organizations of the
ironworkers power to settle differences?"
As none of the committee had informed
himself as to the power, a conference with
the strikers was arransed.
Strikers Will Vote en Hatter.
. Representatives of all the iron trades
Â¦were present at the latter meeting. Tho
representatives of the committee were in
formed that under sections 2 and 3. article
VI. of the constitution of the Grand L^dffe
and subordinate lodj;fs of the Interna
tional Association of ilach-nists, *=uch a
power existed. These sections refer to
the grievances of members, and provide
that the lodge shall decide by secret bai
lot upon the question. The matter of set
tlement is practically embraced in the
latter part of section 3, reading as fol
lows:
Wnen a proposition of F^ttlement. or one to
declare the strike off. Khali be presented at a
regular or called meeting- of the lodge, it shall
require a majority vote by secret ballot of all
members orÂ»sent to accept the" proposition.
Â¦When the judicial officers find it impossible to
FÂ«?ttle the difficulty in a satisfactory manner
they shall order the men to resume work, as
they xrould not receive further financial aid;
excepting that it shall be discretionary with
the judicial officers lo give relief in deserving:
cases, euch relief not to exceed, weekly, the
amount as provided above.
In expectation of some such action as
Js now being taken, a referendum vote on
the question -whether to continue the
strike or submit to arbitration is now be
ing taken by the local unions. Just in
what form the matter was put none of
those in authority will say, but the public
will be informed some time to-day,
through the medium of the Iron Trades
Council, what result has been reached.
Where regular meetings have not been
held eince the vote was called for spe
cial meetings have been held. The votes
will be counted early this morning, or as
soon as all the returns are received. Any

L 1 AST night in the several Assem
bly districts of i San Francisco
blubs were, organized under the
kuspices of the Republican Pri
. mary League. The enrollment of
voters was larger than expected. In two
or three, districts the meetings for organ
ization took on the character of popular
demonstrations in behalf, of good govern
ment. The .Republican Primary League
is now effectively established in every dis
trict of the city and will be able to ren :
der the puMic great service in putting for
ward good and true men for delegates 1.o
the municipal nominating convention of
the party. It Is obvious that the power
and influence of the league will increase
daily from this time until August 13, the
day of primary election.
Twenty-Eighth District.
Republicans of the Twenty-eighth As
sembly District, In response to a call is
sued by the Republican Primary League,
met at 46 Steuart street last evening and'
organized a club. Colonel L. P. Crane
was .elected president, M. , M. Foote vice
president and F-. J. Hopper secretary.
Gangs of ruffians and rounders recruited
in the tenderloin sought to disturb the
meeting and caused several fights. This
district is the stronghold of thÂ« bosses,
hence the attempt to prevent organization
of the league forces- The rounders who
provoked the disturbance sought to show
their gratitude to Boss Kelly for favors
extended in keeping them from going to
jail by putting him in nomination for
president of the club. There are many
indications that the league will develop
sufficient strength in the Twenty-eighth
to elect the delegates from that district
to the nominating convention-.
Twenty-Ninth District.
The Republicans of the Twenty-ninth
Assembly District organized a good club
last evening. J. B. McNamara called the

if they keep up the good work begun last
night.

division of the rewards of politics as of its
labors, so that North Beach can have a
Supervisor -now and then, for instance.
The league is not seeking patronage, but
it wants to see the patronage apportioned
to the districts, and by the districts given
to their workers. This is an auspicious
year, and we 'want to win and to win hon

feature of the meeting was the lack of

followed, "which ended only when one of
the members was escorted from the hall

Rely Upon Public Verdict.
"We don't know whether ' the . law can reach
these men who seem determined to ruin the
business of employers that give their employes
humane conditions and who advertise this to
the public by the display of a. union card. We
believe, however, that public opinion -will
quickly and surely render its verdict. We ap
peal to all union men and women and to all
friends of progress and opponents of tyranny
to give their patronage to restaurants dis
playing the union card. We also urge upon all
members of unions and all friend3 of progress
and opponents of tyranny to help us check
these outrages upon the citizens of San Fran
cisco by withholding their patronage from

bers' and Retailers';. Association, and boasts
of his success in his interviews in the papers.
The. proprietors of this market were largely
responsible for the strike of the Journeymen
butchers; now they are fighting the cooks and
waiters.
Having thus laid our case before the public,
we ask for its most- careful consideration. We
believe, nay, we know, that the trusts are
trying to crush out the manhood of the people
of this city. We shall â¢ continue the fight
against tyranny and oppression. But the fight
is hot and hard. We ask the support of all
who . believe in progress, of all who believe
in freedom and Justice. We are.

Satin Corded Belts for 35c is another convincing proof of what our work-
