"Who Is this Portia Knight?" in^uireV
the Duchess in a high, light tor.e. Her
natural voice Is rather deep, so the Duke
knew that something was the matter. It
behooved him to explain as gracefully as
possible.
"My dear," he replied "it is .in ordi
nary game of bluff. Of course, the ladv
Is after money, and of course. I haven't
any money. The only thing she can-<lo
Is to Join the band of hope of my other
creditors."
Then the Duchess laughed in a j=atlsflefl
way. He put it neatly, and she likes to
hear a thing put r.eatly. She has an al
most French appreciation of that sort of
thine.
â¢"We have had a charminp trip to Amer
ica, have we not?" he asked.
"Cha/mlr.g." she replied, wanting to be
reassured.
"And wouldn't it be a pity to spo'.l It by
a rMiculous girl's ridiculous charge?"
"If the charge is ridiculous." with hes
itation.
"If the past r.--onths haven't proved that,
tvlat could prove it?"
"We'll go OÂ£ to Ireland." she replied
adorably, and the merry honeymoon
<5anced on to the Jingle of Zimmerman
dollars. '
This !ittle episode because, as you rÂ»
rr.err.l<Â«>r. when the Duke and Duches*
landed at Liverpool In March of this year;
ihcy were met with the announcement of
ihe Jegal contention to ben made by Miss
Portia Knight, who claimed that by right
of the Duke's promise she should be thÂ«
Duchess.
â¢a: bc**Â£b of premise suit is such bad *
form." tbe Duke always said.
"The breach of promise is worse form,"
fiaid Hiss Knight when she heard the rÂ«
ir.srk
Portia Kr.Igbt Is one of those uncom
fortable people who always want mor?
Than they can have. Perhaps it Is her
misfortune not to have it. or perhapg It
!b her fault to want it. At any rate, eh<*
le a most restless, dissatisfied young per
frcn. .
First ehe wanted to become "Our Per
tla" to American theater-goers, and ehe
couldn't make out what they were about
that they never laid claim to her. They
bore up beautifully when she left and
went to London.
Next ehe wanted to be London'i dar
ling. It was her bad luck again that
London didn't have any vacancy on Us
list of darlings.
Finally she wanted a Duke. Not only
that, but ehe -wanted a particular r>uke,
Bhe wanted the Duke of Manchester,
Simultaneously Helena Zlmmermm want
ed him, and she was the one taken, whllo
Portia was the one left. *
It I9, perfectly plala that eho <!Â©<?sn't
wear a four-leaf clover in a locket *.n<1
that ehe lost her left hind rabbit's foot
found behind the third white stone at tha
right hand eide cf the graveyard's Â©14
path's eecond turning in the ninth quar*
ler cf the moon.
Perhaps ehe etarted out wrong: by be
ing born in Salem. Or. It never waÂ« eon
elfiered. an especially lucky place to b<?
born. She may realize now that thlE r/aq
her first mistake, and she known well
enough that it is too late to rectify it,
Just as it always Is with mistakes.
Seriously, though, ehe has bad 4 har<l
fight of it, for she has often been poor
and has elwaj's had no health. For thc<
latter reason ehe didn't play when Â«hci
was a little girl, but eat by herself an4
thought whenever she could get "Klng'a
X" from sticks or tag.
"I want to grow up to be a beautiful
lady and live In a castle." was what Â«he
thought In her fooiish little head. Unfor
tunately she kept on thinking the earn?
thing after she grew up, and that is why,
at 26, ehe is euir.g tbe owner of a casuu
for breach of promise.
Physical weakness has haunted her all
her fife and perhaps ie the. cause of what.
tome call her emotional temperament, anQ
other" call her hysterics. She is pltoously
ambitious. She wants to be everything
that she can't be, a duchess included.
"I'm elck of the convent." she said Â«t
the end of her first lsudlment of educa
Â£0 ehe was sent to a boarding school In
Portland. . .,â ., .
"I hate boarding school life, ahe raid.
"That's not the point." her father re
plied. It was up to him, as there waÂ« ni
mother, and a father always has to hit
a wall until he knocks it down. Colonel
N. P. Knight didn't know how to get
erounfl the matter.
Then ehe arranged to ha.ve her health
Probably she didn't even know that ehe
errarged It. The health really gave out,
because ehe fretted it to death. That
cave her a chance to go home.
Home by this time was a ranch In
Klamath County. Her brother. Winter
Knieht, was having a flirtation with the
Indian cook, a reservation girl named
MeMnda. Fhe was an ordinary reservation
Indian with nothing romantic in her
ores or her ways, nothing even pio
lureeque. She was merely dark brown
end greasy. *
Winter and Portia had been very g^od
friend* as children, but there 1* no rooord
that ehe sympathized with him In this
kitchen love affair. It Is likely that it
was a sore subject between them, Judg.
Ing from her love of the beautiful and the
romantic and from hla ptubbornneea.
Winter was cutting himself loose from
his white friends and spending hla time li
the wigwams instead of in the losr cabin
on the ranch. He finally eloped with Me.

The next thing she heard of was tha
wedding in Marylebone parish church.Th-3
result of this was that phe went back
to a small part on the stage and that a
court summons awaited the Duke at tha
Â«ad of bis honeymoon.
/When she heard of the Zimmerman en
gagement it wasÂ» just after the Dtike had
lÂ»ft for a little trip across the Channel.
Portia Immediately packed up and fol
lowed to Paris. There she could not sea
himâ he disappeared as completely as she
had a short time before, and she never
succeeded in obtaining the Interview she
â¢was after. - . -
Miss Krilgbt says that the plan of star
ring was abandoned because Manchester
wanted her to marry him and give up tha
utage entirely. â¢ She also says that they
â¢were to be married last summer and that
the , arrangements had been made with
Father Gordon of the Brompton Oratory.
Ile'fo flead now. po he can't witness.
There were all kinds of theories about
this. Perhaps she and the Duke quarrel
ed. Perhaps she did It for the sake of
advertising. Perhaps it was all a freak,
a whim, without explanation. At any rate
nhe entered a convent and was about to
assume the veil when he found her. Ha
had been hunting like a sleuth and had
employed detectives. She was in a con
vent connected with Brompton Oratory,
and he dragged her out of It. I presume
that she wanted to be dragged. The Duka
had very prettily written that he would
Mow out the ga3 If she didn't come with
him. and she very prettily replied that
she couldn't let him waste the gas. He
is said to have broken into the convent
by force of manly muscle. He got her.
The plan of starring her came to naught,
but the lovemakfng of the two was re
sumed and the nlTair was doing nicely
when 'the report of the Zimmerman en
gagement was -circulated and soon follow
ed by the Zimmerman wedding.
Whether this was true or not, sha told
her friends that the engagement had hap
pened and she cabled to her father for his
consent. Goodness knows why he refused
it. but he did. This, however, only lent
charm to the affair.
The Duke, having exhausted all tha
flower, candy, dinner, boat-naming and
excursion possibilities, next decided to
star his- favorite. He bought a play for
her. he bought a manager for her, ha
bought the use of a theater for her. Just
as the time for her debut waa at hand,
she disappeared.
As soon as she was able to be out they
went on excursions together. They went
to Oxford one day, she became tired In
making the rounds of the buildings and
she was taken ill again. She claims that
It was during this Illness that sha and
the Duke became engaged.
She must have proved an interesting in
valid, for the Duke was devoted. Ha
bought her roses in carnation season and
vice versa. He named his boat Portia.
He had a beautiful time sentimentalizing.
Whether she really thought he meant It
all can never be known, but at any rata
she chose to claim that she did.
The Elliott girls got her work. Her
eyes got her a Duke. She couldn't keep
either.
She was In the height of a magnificent
time when she fell down stairs. And this
â¢was only the first of her downfalls. Sha
had been dining at the Hotel Cecil when
it happened. That was the last gay din
ner for her foi some time. Her aplns
was injured and she was laid up for
weeks.
On the whole, they greatly enjoyed her
visit, taking their enjoyment in delicious
Ebocks. As for her, she thought they
were great bores. She did what actresses
all do sooner or laterâ she went to Lon
don.
She astounded Salem.
She had learned so many things sine*
she had been Â«one. She set about teach
ing these things to the Salemltes, and
some were eager to learn, while others
hesitated.
Her fatber'3 joy at seeing her waa not
unmixed. During Portia's ups she had at
tended to some of his financial affairs,
and he had reasons of his own for liking
to see her prosperous.
The ups and down continued and In
cluded a small part in a barn-stormlng
company, a metropolitan engagement as
understudy in Sothern's company, mere
tramping among agencies, and in tha end
a return to Oregon. â¢
It occurred to her to try posing. 8hÂ«
thought up a false name, as they all do
tor-rtbts pot-boiling work, and with It sha
betook herself to the studios. She was
turned down, sometimes politely and
sometimes impolitely. You can see from
her photograph what was the matter. She.
has gorgeous eyes, storm-clouds of hair,
the figure of a Venus, but her mouth and
nose won't do a little -bit. They are not
classical. In fact, they are rather coarse.
From an artistic point of view she was
out of the question. So she gave up tha
studio canvassing.
She was ill again. She was 111 a great
many times, and all the while she was
dragging herself from one agency to an
other when she was able to walk. Car
faro was a luxury. She kept her belong
ings in a dreary Twenty-third street
boarding house and she gave her address
as often as she could at a friend's housÂ«
and was vague about It the rest of thÂ«
time.
Once there, she had ups and Â¦ downs.
Phe has a knack of making friends and
this knack gave her several starts that
never developed into anything more than
starts. Mrs. Sarah Cowell Le Moyne was
one of her most valuable acquisitions.
Mrs. Le Moyne has a tremendous heart,
and she took Portia into it. She cheered
her and advised her and condoled 'with
her, and better, she introduced her right
and left to the right people. The upshot
was that she got a chance to rehearse
with the "Moth and the Flame" company,
but a man whom she called a heartless
wretch refused her the part she wanted
and she left the company In something
that looked like hysterics and that she
called anxiety.
Her troubles now became financial. ShÂ«
has always had troubles. It has been for
tunate that they have changed about. Her
health was doing very well for It, but
Warde was hearing of discrepancies at
the box office. It was one of those years,
you will remember, when he and James
split and both took pleasure In becoming
poor but proud. Warde's company finally
broke up. the people of It were left
stranded, and Portia Knight had to tele
graph to her father for fifty dollars with
which to reach New Tcrk.
She made her next start toward the pro
fessional stage and for the once she had a
little show of success. Frederic "Ward*
was playing: in San Francisco in the early
part of '96. and somehow he and *ho
patched it up between them that shÂ»
Bhould understudy his leading lady. This
pave her come training and the chance to
add an experience line to her professional
card.
By the time she considered herself
through with study ahe had gained Just
enough practicality to know the value of
advertising. She attempted to give dra
matic recitations for the purpose of mak
ing herself known. After a few small at
tempts she prepared for a blar entertain
ment, and then her haunting Illness ap
peared again and on the eve of the per
formance she gave out. The entertain
ment was indefinitely postponed.
As the stage was not looking for â¢
roung lady without training, without
money, without anything but a good fig
ure and a pair of stunning eyes, she found
It necessary to study first. She entered a
dramatic school, where she studied what
phe didn't know and taugrht what shÂ»
did. In this school she made friends with
Maxine and Gertrude Elliott, who came In
hnndy later on.

can be found the most valuable collection
of old-time followers of the stage in thfe
city. Perhaps the most marked of all is
the group photograph, showing all of the
great American actors and actresses that
from time to time have figured .in the
famous old stock company of the Cali
fornia Theaterâ Edwin Booth, Lawrence
Barrett. Adelaide Nielson, old Mrs. Ju
dah. Mme. Janauschek, James O'Neill.
Clara Morris, Emily Melville and many
others.
Walter and Harry Morosco of the Grand
Opera-house have quarters that would
tempt almost any one to become a man
ager. Rich tapestry, quaint artistic bits
of bric-a-brac, easy chairs and soft rugs
in abundance.
Now to some of our local managers and
their homes. Perhaps there is more spec
ulation as to the duties and .pleasures of
theatrical people than of -any other
profession. Some will insist that a man
ager's life Is all beer and skittles, others
that It is all worry; neither, however, is
correct, but from general observation the
former theory has a blp the best of it. I
fancy.
Nat Goodwin and his beautiful wife,
Maxine Elliott, make their headquarters

The crowning torture of a stage kiss
may beâ and. where possible. Isâ avoided
by the "kiss Implied" method. Here the
author's victims shoot their heads over
each other's shoulder, and by their ec
static thrills give the audience to under
stand that a kiss is going on somewhere
in the region of" the ear. But the "kiss
Implied" must be done very adroitly or
the implication will be missing; and he
must carefully guard the lapel of his
dress coat from contact with her cheek,
for both their sakes. But ifls a cowardly
subterfuge at best. Or it may be that a
mere planting of the lips , on her brow.
Just near the wig. will suffice: but this
"kiss paternal" denotes a flabby, Regen
erate sort of lover.^ Again, If matters
have not ' gone to extremes, the young
man may get off with kissing the lady's
hand; the "kiss reverential" is a good
way out of thft difficulty when practica
ble. But the best way of all, from the
actor's point of view, is to cut out the ob
jectionable Hne3 ana episode or to rewrite
the play. ..%. ; :

hundreds of peopleâ meny of them
experienced In \ the art of osculation
âhave nothing else Â¦ to attract their at

audience forgets that, which is probably
the case, these ardent lovers are the
merest acquaintances, possibly even not
on speaking terms outside the theater, es
pecially If there be a great discrepancy
in their respective salaries. No, the dress

his manly bosom.

A bump of domesticity are tHese facts
concerning the off-duty -hours and the
pocjal Fide in the lives of some of our well
known professionals.
Actors may travel ten months out of the
year and during that time hotels will be
their abiding-place, but as surely as the
months between seasons come around you
will find them in their own homes enjoy
ing the delights of amateur gardening,
farming, prospectingâ In fact, almost any
thing that is In direct contrast to their
life work, for it is the country air, the
new occupations and the exercise that
give them strength and vigor to cope
mentally and physically with the demands
of the public for the following season.
Many a stage heroine or a matinee hero
develops the taste for ranching, and all
over California one can find cozy little ha
ciendas belonging to various members of
the profession. Foreign artists are not ex
empt from this love of country life ar.d
domesticity.
Jean de Reszke has a country home a
few miles from St. Petersburg, where his
friends can find him sunburned and happy
and In all probability if one should call
In the morning they would catch this art
lit with a fcroad-brlmmed sombrero shad-
Ing his eyes and a garden rake in his
hands. There Is nothing really more de-
Jlghtful than playing at work.
Albert Saleza spends his off hours on his
farm near Burges in the lower Pyrenees,
where he Is enthusiastic to a degree over
his chickens, pigs and cows. I am told
that the keenest pleasure and the most
beneficial exercise is taken In these serio
comic attempts at ranching.
Imagine the handsome Ernest Hastings
varying his morning calisthenics by pull
ing the weeds from the lettuce bed, or the
dainty little Edna "Wallace Hopper taking
corn to the chickens and every afternoon
going the rounds gathering the eggs In
her gingham sunbonnetâ well, that is
what you are very apt to find her doing
should you happen to visit her in her lit
tle ranch home near Alameda during va
cation.
Modjeska delights in entertaining her
friends in her country place near San
Diego. Florence Roberts takes her vaca

where every room is furnished with an
eye to solid comfort, and as Lewis Morri

San Franciscans are familiar with the
sight of these two spinning along the

TVhite TVhittlesey has a hobby, think of
it. matinee girls, your hero has a hobby,
and it isâ home. But that home is in Con

embroidered draperies are now and then
picked up along the route of travel and
all find their way back to the Eastern

Mr. Whittlesey busy transplanting pan
sies. and sometimes when the gardener Is
not looking he will run the lawn mower
along In uneven amateurish fashion,
thinking all the time, no doubt, that had
not fate made him an actor he would have
been a capital farmer. Midsummer illu
eions. to be sure!
Henry Miller is absolutely devoid of
hobbles at the present time: work, work
Is his every-day programme, and his home
Is where the hour finds him. His vaca
tions are spent abroad, where he still
keeps in touch with theatricals and study,
but fifteen years hence he Is going to pur
sue a fad- I have his word for it. Now,
what do you suppose It Is? No more nor
less than doing just exactly as he pleases.
Sleep when and as long as he wishes, eat
what he likes regardless of the fattening
qualities, let his beard grow long, don
his most comfortable clothes for all occa
sions, and last, but not least, occasionally
enjoy seeing a show from the front of the
house In place of getting a profile view
from the wings.
Can any one conjure a more ideal pic
ture of comfort for an overworked actor?
Lillian Burkhart has a flat in New
York-
In reality a stage kiss Is a thing of lit
tle ecstasy to the parties concerned. It
Is. as a rale, dreaded by both. Where the
artists are of a nervous temperament the
thought of the stage kiss keeps them
awake at nights. Never since the days
of Judas has anything In kisses been in
vented so completely giving the lie to the
real article. In the first place, however
It may seem from the front, it is not easy
to* put much "soul" Into the affair under
the eyes of several hundred spectators. It
would not be easy, I imagine, in actual
AMT (wildly)â I love you! I' love
you!
Sir Athol (crossing to her quickly)

They embrace passionately.
So runs the manuscript, and "Sir Athol"

each other's eyes and yearn.
'"You bet he's pretty sweet on her In real
life." observes the sapient Edwin on the
way home, "or he'd never kiss her like
that!"
"Oh, do 'ueh!" replies his divinity coyly.
"Not but what I thought so, too."
And the ardent young stockbroker's
clerk, who has a great reputation In his
home circle as a "regular flirt," feels
that he Is being wasted in mere business;
that, loving the stage, he would make a
eplendld "stage lover": and, with no other
qualification than that of suburban Don
Juanlsra, he forthwith Joins Mr. Squeezer's

HOW
THEATRICAL
FOLK LIVEThe Germans used to make the manner
In which the. ring was worn of signifi

marry, he wore a ring on the first finger
of his left hand; if engaged, he put it on
the second finger; If married, on the third;
if he preferred to remain single he wore
it on his little finger. The woman an
nounced her intention In the same man

Wedding rings are not always plain gold
circlets. During the last few years a
large number of couples have adopted a
ring* made in two parts. When worn, it
looks like an ordinary gold ring, with an

k As a matter of fact it Is thirty years
old, but only lately has anybody paid at
tention to it. Old Dr. Stillof Kirksville,
Mo., was . the man who made it and
named it. and ha started other men to
working out what he was pretty vague
about. He named the system osteopathy,
from "osteon," - which means bone, and
All over the country It is being henrd
of, and is gaining converts every day.
Besides those already named, such famous
people as the Forakers, Governors Tan
ner, Stevens. Grout, Lee and Shaw, e>x-
Governor Pingree, Daniel Frohmanâ these
are all on the list. In our own city
Charles Paxton and Charles - Fish are
among those who have been won over.
It's time to know what osteopathy means.
Other States -besides New York have
squabbled over the same thing, and in ten
of them the new practice of healing las
come out ahead. , California is at last on
the list of those legalizing the practice,
and, in consequence, osteopathy is flour
ishing hereabouts like the green bay tree.
San Francisco has a sanitarium and a
college, where, after a two years' course,
students may be graduated to the degree
of D.-O.,; which means Diplomat or-Doc
tor'of Osteopathy, as you like. /-.; .-_ 'Â¦ -_[
we will be bound to have them. I didn't
care a ftg about them till I heard of this
bill. I may want more than one osteopath,
because had the Clemens ' tribe been In
the Garden of Eden they would have tak

Goodness only knows there are
enough broken bones and brain con
gestions and pneumonias in the world
âquite enough to help us find out
cur friends. As for the unreal ones,
they are a bore to others and ought
to be to ourselves. I have the kind
est regard for all the doctors I know,
osteopathic and otherwise, but I
think we should be better off if more
of them had to give up their rigs and
ride in five-cent street cars.
At present, some of us are doing
bo in order to pay their bills.

they can help us more. It makes us

Osteopathyâ A Gangerous thing
because a break from the beaten path
say the more serious-minded opposers.
Osteopathy â The only possible system of
healing, say the devotees.
At any rate, all acknowledge that it is
worth fighting about, and that proven
that it is . no unimportant system of kill-'
Ing or curing, whichever it may be.
Well-known people all over the United
States are taking it up and Introducing it
to their families. Among them are Mrs.
Carrie'Nation and Mark Twain. The for

dares disapprove of it while she is
around. The latter told 4000 people In the
Albany Assembly chamber that josteo'-'.

â¢ The State of New York was divided
against itself in the matter. What Mark
said was this:
"The State stands like a Gibraltar for
spiritual liberty, and it should stand for
bodily liberty. You have a right to doctor
your soul in any way you please, even to '
its, everlasting. death. Why should the
State step in with this matter of smaller
consequence? Don't let us "whittle our
liberties down.
"Drive the osteopaths out of the. State
and it will be the old story of the Garden
of Eden. Adam didn't . need the apple,
Â¦ but when It was' prohibited he sinned to
eet it. A3 sure as you prohibit osteopaths.
But it is still another encourager
of ailments. This town and every
other town of America is full of
them. There are the orthodox prac
tioners, tier upon tier of them, in the
downtown office buildings. There are

I was looking to see a room split
in two by a screen- I was looking for
a piece of furniture, outwardly any
thing from wardrobe to parlor organ
and inwardly folding bed. Not a bit
of It.
Osteopathy occupies the whole
building represented by its Sutter
street number. I awaited Diplomat
in a reception room where I saw mir
rored full-lengths of myself framed
in gold on every side and where I
could not hear my own feet fall for
the velvety depths of the carpet. The
chairs were sleek and portly and bro
caded.
"You look prosperous here,*' I said
to the Diplomat.
He rubbed his silky hands to
gether in a prosperous way and
smiled a prosperous smile.
"We are," he replied, and opened
his dainty Sussia leather appoint
ment book. ' j
It was overflowing.
That is just the trouble. Osteo
pathy, like every other form of cure,
is far too prosperous. Osteopathy is
no doubt all right; after ell the Di
plomat's beautiful explanations of
the bodily mechanism and the way
its wheels and levers should be put
in order, I can't but believe that it is
all right. There could' be nothing
more plausible; the mechanism of
your body is tut of order just as that
of your bicycle might be; Osteopathy
keeps a repair shop -where you can
drop in with your body and have it
repaired while you wait.
SOME obscure quackery," I said
when I started out to find Os
teopathy.
Then, when the number was
given me â
"In the smart Sutter-street dis
trict," I reflected, "where it is good
form to take one's ailments. For ths
cake of engraving that address on its
card, Osteopathy hangs out a shingle
in a back room. The shingle an
nounces '2 to 4 p. m.' because that
gives an air of importance, and Os
vteopathy lunches on coffee and
doughnuts and wishes it dare receive
patients the other 22 hours."
It Is a. sorry fact to own that we
women have more of these cherished
ailments than men have. A man
doesn't often develop them unless his
wife is the kind that runs after him
armed with a bottle of liniment in
one hand and a mustard plaster In the
ether; then he feels that he must pro
vide targets for her weapons.
. It is left for some of our sex to
assemble and compare notes over the
teacups on headaches. Most men con
sider ailments the unimportant
things of life because they are the
disagreeable ones. A man said to tee
the other day:
tered here, there and everywhere.
There are too many of them doirg
thriving businesses. There can't be
enough real ailments in this town
of 350,000 people to pay the rent ot
all these suites of offices and to ke^p
up all those swagger, professional
rigs. The trouble is that they ara
largely supported fcy unreal ailments
We have so many of. them and

lavish on them all we can afford and
usually a good deal more. The doc

for their coverings. I took my throat
to Chicago and gave it a five-dollar-a
peep specialist. When it was tired of
him, I hired others and bought out
drugstores. I treated it like a spoiled
child. It ran up immense bills for
me, and for a while I worried abou 1 :
them, but in the end I learned phil
osophy. The last bill -was so big that
I knew it must be meant as a joke, so
I threw it in the waste basket and
decided to take the joke all in good
part and always to speak pleasantly
to the joker when I met him.
By that time I was tired of bror
chitis and tonsilitis. I had gone the
round of cures and it occurred to me
that I had done enough. So I gave
up my throat, cut its acquaintance,
forgot that it existed, and the resu' r t
ie that I have never heard from it
since. ,
Old Dr. Still invented the thing in Mis
souri, but It is, being talked about from
coast to coast, and one of its representa
tives, Dr. Llttlejohn. has read a" paper
about It before a society in London. So if
it keeps on at this rate it looks as If the
druggists would have to throw out all
their stock except stamps, telephones and
the directory.
He makes a big point of the claim that
there are no sorry effects from their
treatments. There are no stimulants to
react from, no poisonous drugs for the
system to recover from.
Then the diplomat repeats: No drugs ex
cept toxic antidotes and anesthetics. The
druggists hate him,* and no wondei. We
use' mechanical therapeutics. And he
spells it with en upper-case M and T.
Dr. J. M. Smith, they add, oftthe New
York Collfge of Physicians and Surgeons
says of digitalis: "It has hurried I thou.
pands to the grave. All medicines which
enter the circulation poison the blood in
the same manner as do the poisons that
produce disease."
"The blood is the life," they quote, and
It can't be set in order by the use of
drugs. As for heart diseases, they say.
the current practice is to treat the pa
tient with some of the cardiac poisons or
heart paralyzers, seeking to control the
heart's action, when the heart Is doing
the best it can under the abnormal condi
tions existing elsewhere. Probably by far
the most commonly used of these poisons
Is digitalis, yet Dunglison in his medical
dictionary says of this poison that "It Is
cumulative in Its action, and that In over
doses it causes vomiting:, purging, dimness
of sight, vertigo, delirium, hiccough, con
vulsions and deathâ all the symptoms, in
short, which characterize the acrotar
cotic class of poisons."
â¢ Every druggist in the country is apply
ing his little hammer to the' osteopaths,
for they are smashing his bottles for him
as if they were all Mrs. Nations and his
goocU were all gin. They don't do It with
a hatchet; they merely tell you that he Is
selling you poison. and~they can cure you
by other and far pleasanter means. There
Is no doubt that it Is far nicer to lie down
comfortably and be rubbed and kneaded
and stroked until you feel like a sleepy
kitten than to pour down brown doses and
gulp pills, one after each meal and at
bedtime.
The body, says. Dr. Potter, is like a
clock. If all the -wheels and springs are
in good running order It will ,take care of
itself. They can be put in order by keep
ing up th? circulation and the activity of
the nerve forces.
These sympathetic nerves are the means
of reaching those organs that cannot be
directly wrought upon by manipulation.
The solar plexus is the center of them.
How are you going to regulate matters
without medicine? There are nerve cen
ters In the spine; these connect by a per
fect telegraph system with the vital or
gans. Then throw away your medicine
bottles, say the osteopaths, let us lay you
on an operating table and we will inhibit
the nerves along your spine, or lrrita*e
them, as the need may be. Maybe you"
don't believe it. but we can reach your
digestive organs that way and settle In
ehort order with that lobster salad that
you stowed away after midnight.
Then he will explain to you how he
presses upon a nerve, usually in the spine,
and how this pressure, by means of the
sympathetic nerves, reaches In. Its effects
the part of the body where the obstruc
tion has occurred. The proper manipula
tion or pressure, causes a stimulation that
results In the "moving on" of the obstruc
tion.
The way that the osteopath does this
Is by manipulation. He has the trick of
kneading down very much finer than any
masseur that pretends to do the same. If
you compare his treatment to massage he
will look at you In a way not friendly,
and you will feel a chill In the atmosphere
until you have covered up your blunders.
"The difference," he will explain Icily, "is
that massage Is a general system of
manipulation without any specific end In
view, and Is usually practiced by per
sons who wouldn't understand the science
of the body If It were explained to them.**
All this was well enough In Its way. but
there was not enough of ft. Evidently
the bones could not be m$de responsible
for every 111 that flesh is heir to. So the
followers of Dr. Still enlarged upon his
theory- They said: The principles ap
plied to the osseous system are equally
applicable to every system of the body.
Then, if all the syste'ms of the body are
unotstrrcted in their work they will per
form their functions perfectly, health will
be certain, and man will need no remedial
agency whatever. If a policeman finds a
street obstructed by a disorderly crowd,
he says "Move on." The physician who
finds the system of the body obstructed
says "Move on" to the obstruction.
So he began to experiment and in time
he worked out a system by which he
claimed and believed that disease could
be cured. His reasoning was this: By
the displacement of a bene the blood or
nerve supply of the body is interfered
with and disease results. Remove the ob
struction by placing the bony parts of the
body in perfect order and health returns.
Something was wrong with medicine, he
told himself. The children might have
been saved.
"pathos,"* which means disease, but thÂ«
Idea of bone disease Is. so narrow & on*
that the modern osteopaths would like to
change thÂ© name If It hadn't already be
come a fixture. Dr. Still had some sort
of an Idea that all disease was In the
bone and could be treated accordingly.
but his followers don't hold to that. They
say that he had an Inkling of the real
thing and that they are elaborating It.
He pointed out the way and they are
grading it. The chances are that they are
reaping the rewards, too.
In the year 1871 Dr. Still lost three chil
dren within twenty-four hours. They all
died of spinal meningitis.

Yale Bicentennial Series.
A series of volumes has been prepared
by ifi number of professors and instructors
of Yale University to be Issued in connec
.tion . with the bicentennial anniversary
of the university as a partial indication
of the character of the studies in which
the University teachers are engaged. The
serler" will be published by Charles Scrib
[ner's Sons, and will comprise about thirty
volumes, which are intended to illustrate
the function of the .university in the dis
covery and orderly arrangement of knowl
edge. Some of the works are special and
technical, but works of more general in
terest will also be found in the set. In
the series will be Included books on the
social sciences, history, minor philological
Â¦sciences, linguistics and phonetics; vol
.umes.on literature, ancient and modern;
mathematics, pure and applied, arid on
physics and mechanics. Also collected pa
pers written by Instructors and advanced
students In the various laboratories, taken
from scientific j journals and reprinted
with some new additional contributions.
*In one case all the work of the laboratory
is thus .collected. % If is confidently ex
pected that with few exceptions these
volumes will be published before the bi
centennial celebration in October.
Â¦ , The first of the .series to appear Is one
on' "The. Confederate States of America,
1861-1S65," by John 'Christopher Schwab,
professor of political economy in Yale Uni
versity. ' This work gives a financial and
Industrial history of the South during the
Civil War. Others have written the his
tory of the finances and industries of the
North, but the South has heretofore been
neglected, -owing to, the lack of reliable
material upon which to base the complete
sister, and a sympathetic priest, Durant,
escape to the mountains to make a last
stand at an almost impassable defile.
Their party is finally overwhelmed by
superior numbers, but not until Mathilde
has murdered Madret in his tent and
nearly every one else has been killed or
mortally -wounded.
The end of the book is as tragic as coujd
be expected for a tale that from the first
page breathes of portending evil. Mr.
Embree writes with* a forceful pen, but
this story is really far ' fetched in its
dramatic effects and of rather the dime
novel order. (Published by The Bowen-
Merrill Company, Indianapolis. Price
$1 50.)
The Aristocrats.
"The Aristocrats" Is supposedly a col
lection of letters written by an English
woman in the Adirondacks to a friend in
Great Britain. Lady Helen, the writer of
the letters, is the sister of a,, young Eng
lish Duke. The Duke has come to
America "with his two sisters to seek
among the forests of the Adirondacks
restoration of a health lost in dissipa
tion. ' . Â¦ ,
Several months are spent by them in a
cottage far up in the woods. The author
is certainly a great lover of nature, as Is
shown by the appreciation in the letters
of this young girl. The matter of climate
and scenery Is, however, a side issue to
the real purpose of the book. This real
purpose seems to be a sarcastic and caus
tic criticism of both Americans and Eng
lishmen.
The letters wonder at the odd types of
humanity we have that call themselves
Americans, and most cleverly set forth
our weaknessesâ all as 6een' through the
cp.i did eyes of this young woman who is
sveh a good correspondent of some one
over the -water.
This said young woman, the sister of the
Duke, holds the most extraordinary views
and also seems to think that her. ideas
are those of the whole British empire. The
main tenor of her thoughts is the vin
dication of free love â she does not claim
to personally approve- of it for herself,
but simply for other people.
The Identity of the author Is held a se*
cret. Tt may have been written by any
one, but it sounds as if It came from the
pen of some New York newspaper man
out for a little fun. It is certainly well
written, .filled with clever epigrams, and
1.3 said to be creating considerable discus
sion in. the East. . From a moral stand
point it is at timesâ rotten! (Published
by John Lane, New York.)
AUPRED DR5VPUS.
ftF the diary of Alfred Dreyfus had been
i published two years ago it would have
jl eet the world on fire. At this time it
is not likely to prove a fad. but. never
theless, it promises to command a great
amount of attention.
Six years have passed since the accusa
tion of the young artillery captain for the
most atrocious of all crimes known to the
Foldierâ high treason against his country.
To the world at large the cry of this man
against the degradation that followed his
trial seevaeA the plea of an innocent man
and subsequent events pointed but the
more strongly to a martyrdom.
For years Dreyfus was out of the world
and remained silent. When he was finally
brought back to receive again his liberty
it was thought for some time that this
wreck of a man would never again know
the blessings of health and strength. He
went to prison young and came out after
those few years prematurely aged.
At last he has spoken and submits to
the world his own account of those fright
ful five years of trial and incarceration,
1R94-1899.
The life of Dreyfus up to. the time of
his accusation Is told In two pages. It
amounts to nothing more than the usual
career of a young army officer. Born in
Alsace. October 9. 1?59. he became a cadet
of artillery in 1SS0. in 18S9 received a com
mission of captain of artillery, was mar
ried the next winter, and in 1S93 took serv
ice In the Second Bureau of the General
Staff.
Saturday, the 13th of October. 1894, was
the beginning of what came very near
being the end. He was arrested on the
suspicion of having furnished the German
military attache in Paris with a treason
able paper. This -was the famous "bor
dereau" that became the basis of the
entire Dreyfus case.
This account of his life by Alfred Drey
fus appeals to the reader not as a mere
recital of occurrences in the case, but be
cause 5t Is by Dreyfus himself. At last
we hear from the persecuted man his own
Fide of the story, his own feelings and
sensations.
We have had the newspaper and maga
zine accounts and reports until every one
is familiar with the details of the case
ar.d has formed his own opinion long ago.
The interest in the mere recital of facts
is dead, trot the curiosity to know exactly
what Dreyfus himself thought about the
whole affair certainly exists. It must be
paid in all justice to the man that abso
lute fairness seems to rule his account,
nnd still this recital is the most dramatic
bit of fact ever published.
In the first chapter Dreyfus tells of his
arrest and peculiar examination by Com
mandant Du Paty. The proceedings were
certainly irregular, to say the least. He
was called into a private room and asked
to copy certain sentences from dictation,
then suddenly charged with high treason,
end hustled away to the military prison.
A note from Commandant Forzinetti.
the head of the prison. Is given In full and
i=hows that this man, accustomed to all
sorts and conditions of prisoners and
criminals, decided in his own mind be
yond the question of a doubt that Drey
fus was an innocent man. It is certainly
a most interesting paper, but too long to
ropy as a whole. This extract shows the
general sentiment:
' "During the years that I have spent as
the head of various military prisons I
have acquired a great experience of pris
oners, and I do not fear to Â»say. and to
pay deliberately, that a terrible mistake
has been made. I have never regarded
Captain Dreyfus as a traitor to his coun
try and uniform."
Then came the first court-martial of
3S94 and the conviction, the beginning of
persecution for the unfortunate man. The
diary says:
To me acqultt*! pwmed certain.

The man's terrible mental sufferings af
ter this are shown in his letters to his
devoted wife. He received another blow
when, on the 31s t of December. 1891 ha
heard that his appeal for a new trial'had
been refuFed. It was then that onlv the
thought of his family and of regaining
his honor kept him from a suicide's
grave. On the 5th of January followed his
degradation. .
"I underwent the horrible torture with
out weakness," he begins simply, as. in
deed, the newppaner reports attest. "Be

the hall of the garrison adjutant. â¢. * â¢

â¢Imagine the, good lady's surprise when,
during the event, she finds her husband
surrounded by all the. titled personages in
the' room, all' falling over each other in

that Mr. Nash is recognized abroad as the
greatest railroad promoter of the century

, Mr. Nash goes his way. with dogged per
sistency, however, and sees everything
there is to be seen; and often surprises
his wife by showing that he knows more
of the ; works of art they are visiting
than she does herself. , She is in despair
when a grand function is in the near fu
ture where they .will meet all the notables
of Europe. First, because she fears that
"George" will not go, and, second, be
cause having consented to go she is afraid
he will not be dressed in the proper man
ner and will disgrace her with his/'Amer
ican .ways." Â¦ .; . . ; . . â¢ . v
Mrs. Nash does not hold a very high
opinion of her husband when it comes to
chancing the delloate diplomacy of mixing
with the cream of foreign society. She is,
moreover, bored to death when- he ex
presses the desire to see Paris as th.e tour
ist sees it. He almost drives her crazy
when he floats about the city in an open
carriage with his guide book In his hand
and his head in the air. j ,

of the refined Mrs. : Nash can bear.' .
It Is to be in Paris that these two, typi
cal of a certain class of Americans, are
to become better friends than ever, be
fore. â¢ . .
This year she succeeds In getting Mr.
Nash to accompany her. Mr. Nash goes
under the doctor's orders, for. like other
American men,' he has worn his life near
ly out in business and had barely time to
strike up a passing acquaintance with his
family. .
Mrs. Nash Is an old hand at the annual
trip to Paris of the New York wealthy
class. She has been going over for years
to pick out her gowns, enjoy the gossip,
educate her child and spend her husband's
money. . . .-
It tells in dialogue the humorous story
of how Mrs. Nash took her husband to
Paris. Mr. Nash is a New York business
man and one of the greatest railroad men
of the United States. He has some twenty
thousand men who hold their positions at
his discretion. In spite of that fact he is
rather under the thumb of madam, who
by no means appreciates the kind of hus

The latest work fro-i the pen of Anna
Bowman Dodd is "The American Hus
band in Paris." The "Three Normanfl

"Falalse, the Town of the Conqueror"
repeated the success 'for Mrs. Dodd. Her

as either of the other two, but it bears
the author's stamp of cleverness and can
not fail to entertain.
In view of the general popularity, espe
cially 1n England, of the revival of handi
crafts, it would be well if Mr. James' sug
gestions on "How the art may be pre
served" were taken up and put in force
by those who have the leisure to devote
to such matters. The Government is
spending much money on the education of
the Indians and there Is a great field for
them In the perpetuation of their own
arts, for which they are better fitted than
for ours.

number the opportunity to secure them is
passing away.
Through all of his more -than two hun
dred . large pages Mr. James never once
gets away from his subject, and there is
not a line of padding in the book. It Is
"copiously illustrated" in. reality, with
pictures which are pertÂ»nent. Over three
hundred illustrations, mostly photo
graphic, and showing altogether probably
more than one thousand basket patterns,
so that the collector or dealer will have
no trouble in placing at once any pattern
which .may come under his notice.'

that the compassion which so great a'
misfortune as mine inspires may be given
"I simply declare once more that I am
innocent of this abominable crime, and I
ask ever and again for this one thing,
always the same thingâ that the search
for the culprit who is the real author of
this base crime be prosecuted.
Following this is a petition to the Pres
ident of the republic to give the diary to
Mme. Dreyfus, closing with:*
"I am so utterly weary, so broken down
In body and soul, that to-day I stop my
diary, not beinp able to foresee how long
my strength will hold out, or what day
my brain will succumb under the weight
of so great a burden." . \
From that time on it is a constant
round of hot, tropical weather varied by
frightful rains, fever, sickness and de
spair. The- only thought that Feems to
hold Dreyfus up is the idea that his men
tality must support life in his body until
he can finally clear his good name. Fi
nally he is put in irons, "as a measure
of precaution," and then he closes his
diary with this last entry:
"Thursday. September 10, 18f6.
I have finished my cooking for the day. This
morning I cut ray piece of meat in two; one
pioÂ«-e In to boll, the other is for steak. To
cook the latter I have contrived a grill from
en eld r!ecÂ» of sheet iron which I picked un
r.n the Island. For drink I have water. My food
is 111 prepared Jn old tin cans. I have nothing
with which to clean these properly and have no
plates. I must pull together all my courage
to live under such condition*, added to all my
mental tortures. Utterly exhausted. I am go
ing to stretch myself out on my bed.
Then follows his dlnry of that year on
this Devils Island, j The man's sufferings
with the heat and the vermin, the rattle
and change of the guards every two hours
so that sleep r is almost impossible, his
struggle for life against the bad food pro
vided, the prevention of all communica
tion with the outside worldâ these things
sound rather like a story from back cen
turies than the doings of a civilized na
tion only a few years ago. Here is a page
from his diary, April 20, 1895, 11 o'clock in
the morning:
At the beginning my rations were those of a
soMlor in the colonies, but without wine. I
had to do my own cooking, and in fact to do
everything myself.

lepers* camp had been, a treeless *na.eÂ« of less
than half an acre. I was absolutely forbidden
to loave these limits. The moment I started
out I was accompanied by the guard, who waÂ«
not tp \ort sight of a elngle one of my move

later on a rifle and cartridge belt were added.

out, so that every two hour^ at guird relief
there was an infernal clatter of keys and
ironwork.
The hut destined for my use -wan built of
Ftone and covered about neventeen square
yards. The windows were prated. The door
was of lattice work , with simple iron bars.
This dcor led to a little hallway six feet square,
the entrance to which was closed by a solid
wooden door. In the anteroom a guard wac
always on duty. These guards were relieved
every two hours; thev were not to loÂ«e sight of
me day or night. Five men were detailed to
that sorvlco.
On April 13 he Is taken to the lie du
Diable, a barren rock used previously for
the isolation of lepers. Here Is a descrip

At lfst he is allo-wed to pee his wife
with the director of the prison in the
middle of the room and guards in front of
the glass door outside. They are warned
that conversation on anything concerning
the trial is forbidden. Even this, however,
was easy compared to the long years
ahead in the solitude of Devils Island.
On the 21st of February he sees his wife
for the last time.
"And now I must remind you that be

since they believed that before them was

strvrreled to transmit to their hearts an

He has written, this part in such a plain,
straightforward way that reading brings
appreciation, sympathy and conviction.
On the 5th of June, 1899, came the first

would have soon sunk into the. unnoticed
past.
It should bÂ« eTp'otneri In t^e beginning
that California Ind-an baskets are some
thins: more than mere baskets as baskets
are known to trÂ» eommTclal world. Thev
are pcipnc\ literature, legend and art all
woven into one.

Is full r>f irfan're. . "Every flbpr nf its
warp and woof was fathered with tender
solicitude- and painful care. The basket

religious idÂ»n. Every shape and design

world-known swastika, eld as the hills
andMmost as unknowable.
Baskets are_ made by other aborigines,
but they are merely containers, utilitarian
makeshifts to take the place of box or
bag, and are void of- meaning or artistic
purpose. , - ; . t
The baskets of u the California Indians
rre alonf enough to Rive their makers
lilgh rank in the ethnological scale, and
the much-repeated ; statement that the
California Indians wore the lowest of all
the American tribes will be hushed before
the evidence, recorded in "Indian Bas
ketry." ".. "
Comparing the Amerinds of East and
West. Mr. Wharton says:
California has long been known as the home
of particularly expert basket . wpavpni. Possi
bly the finest baskets ever madn with but two
or three exceptions, were thÂ«> work of Gualalaa.
Yokuts or Pomas. T.ie fertile, well-woodrrt and
watered western slopes of the majestic Sierra
Nevadas were long the home of an aboriginal
people which In earjy days was so large as to
command the astonishment of travelers fami
liar with the populations of the cold forests
of the Atlantic States, or the vast sterile
waÂ«tÂ«?s of the Interior of the continent.
Stephen Powers estimates that at the begin
ning of the century there must have been not
lew than 700,000 Indians in California alone.
Civilization has swept most of them away. Re
gardless of what the "carpet knights who wield
compiling pens" in comfortable Eastern or
Kuropean libraries say. we who havÂ« Btudlod
the Indian In his own home, have heard his
traditions of the origins of his races and the
stories of their decline, have seen the rapid
diminution of population In recent years, know
full well that it is sadly too true In most cases
that "Civilization bestows all of Its vices and
few if any of its virtues on the American In
dian." ' Â¦
The California Indian was very different from
his warlike brother of the Atlantic Coast and
Great Inland Basin. He was the type of quiet,
contented, peaceful simplicity, i Not that he
never went to war. but he preferred to take
life easy, enjey his simple pleasures. Indulge In
his religious dances, destroy his enemies by
treacherous assassination rather than by open
warfare, and run away with a good-looking
girl whenfhe was too poor to purchase .her.
Of the vast and teeming population of this
ideal land, them are but scattered remnants.
It is a credit to California to have such
â¢a thorough work on a subject the import
ance of which will not be fully apparent
until the opportunity for compiling will
have passed forever. For there is but lit
tle popular interest in -aboriginal art,
which Is the fountain of all art, and the
author's work' must of necessity be a
labor of love. Long as Turkish and* Ori
ental rugs have been before the public, it
is only within the last year that a book
has been published which was devoted ex
clusively to Oriental weaving, although
thetrafllc in the goods must have amount
ed to millions of dollars each year, and
they are found in every household where
beauty Is held above gaudiness. Yet to
many, "the many," all rugs look alike:
â¢ they are merely different kinds of carpet.
To those who know, an antique oriental
rug is something to be put in a glass case
or hung on the wall. There 1 is. the differ
ence between it and other rugs or carpets
that there is between true diamonds and
bits of polished or other glass. So there
is the same intrinsic beautiful value in a
genuine basket, and this book which so
fully records the basket weavers' art and
attainments may by stimulating interest
in the craft rescue It from fast coming
oblivion.
The book is dedicated to "Otis T. Mason
of the Smithsonian Institution, whose con
scientious labors reveal how large a debt
the world owes to aboriginal woman."
In support of this statement, among
other things Mr. James says:
Indian basketry Is almost entirely the work*k
of Indian women, therefore Its study neces
sarily leads us to the sanctum of feminine In
dian life. The thought of the > woman, the art
development, the acquirement of skill, the ap
.prcciation of color, the utilization of crude ma
tprial for her purposes, the labor of gathering
the materials, the objects she had In view in
the manufacture," the methods she followed to
attain, those objects, hfr failures, her" suc
cesses, her attempts to Imitate the striking; ob
jects of nature, with which she came In con
tact, the eBthetlc qualities of mind, that led
her to thus desire to imitate natureâ all these
and a thousand . other things In ' the . Indian
woman's life are discoverable , In an intelligent â¢
study of the baskets they have woven in their'
camps.
One has but to study the history of all In
dustrial, as distinct from military occupations,
to see how honored a position woman hast won,
by her energy, Industry and wit. -.'
about which he Is himself most modest.
Then it is that it gradually dawns upon
the. dress-and-f unction-loving Mrs. Nash
that her husband Is' really a BOmebody,
and . not, merely "the husband of Mrs.
Nash." She has a hard time nursing him
through : a Â¦ dangerous illness, \ but after
that his. stock with his. own family goes
up just about 800 per cent above par, and
the reader, man or woman, cannot help
being pleased. ' â¢
The story as told in dialogue is spark

story entitled "The Inheritors," In which
they claim the heroine- to be an ' nhabl :

her remarkable actions do give color to
the possibility of an ultramundane origin.
The story is a fantasy, and deals with

The July Century, which is to be a fic
tion number with stories by some of the
best known writers of the day. will con
tain nothing more thrilling than the ac
count of an actual escape from the Cha
teau de Joux just a century ago. from the
hitherto unprinted diary of a French roy
alist. "William Glrod, who was the chief
actor in the affair and whose son died re
cently in Brooklyn at the age of 85. Nor
will it contain anything more romantic
than "The True Story of Harman Blen
nerhassett." the highly cultivated young
Irish aristocrat, who came to this country
in 1796 and was induced to advance large
sums of money to aid Aaron Burr in his
treasonable schemes. This narrative, by
a collateral descendant, gives for the first
time the actual facts in the career of this
unfortunate man. who figures conspicu
ously in two of this summer's novels.
"*Even Flnce he finished "Evelyn Innes"
George Moore, the author of that much
talked about piece of realism. "Esther
Waters," has been working steadily and
with intense earnestness upon a new
story. This novel, with the title "Sister
Teresa," he completed a few weeks agoâ
about the time he flung the dust of Eng
lish soil from* his shoes in revolt against
what he regards as the artificiality and
sordidness of London fashionable life and
betook himself to the peaceful delights of
Ireland. And now J. B. Lippincott & Co.
will publish the novel, giving It handsome
dress. Its title must inevitably recall to
readers of "Evelyn Innes." that unusual
story. Evelyn with her beauty, he: art.
her joy in the material pleasures of the
world, but with that strange compelling
impulse now and again to deny the flesh
utterly in theÂ»repose of meditative life â
the same Evelyn, and yet not the same.,
is brought forward in "Sister Teresa."
Nor does her figure lose any of its allure
ments nor her emotions any of their vi
tality and sympathetic appeal in this new
chapter of her life. Mr. Moore's psycho
logical analysis was never as penetrating
and- delicate, so his publishers declare,
his power of expression so sustained and
his story as human as in "Sister Teresa."
Mr. Moore has said that this new book
he regards as the finest thins he has done,
the most satisfactory from an intellectual
point of view and the most satisfying to
his desire to picture life aa It is. The
book will be issued early in July.

reduced to a paragraph. You know how
fond the professional ventriloquist la of
talking up the chimney to an imaginary
man on the roof. Sothern had arranged
for his slavish confederate to mount ths

man, who, when he wished to descend,
found that the ladder was gone. By hook
cr by crook the deceived confederate
found his way to the chimney of - the
smoking-room, where the supper paity

Presently a voice was heard calling down
the chimney, "Sothern! Sothern! Fur
heaven's sake come *nd help me! I can't
get down, and It's raining like mad. 1 "
Sothern was taken aback for a moment,
but only to be in ecstasies the next at

Deafness Is another ailment which haa

the victim's life. Now and again a deaf
man is run over In the streets of cities.
But when deaf people prudently pitch
their tent in the country they live, as a
rule, to a very old age. Probably the
true explanation of this fact is that deaf

A weak heart does not often prolong

we have lost a splendid life preserver. In
a census of aged people taken many years
ego it was found that a very large num

to make a calculation, which proved that
there were twice as many pock-marked
people over M years old as there would

counted for this curious fact by conclud

away all other microbes. Just as rats

DISEASES THAT ARE HELPFUL
IT appears, from the latest medical dis
covery, that several diseases prolong,
Instead of shorten, life.
OCIETY'S newest fad is the photo
y-^. sketch â so it has been named by
Y^ Its originator. The photo sketch
KÂ«y is the latest, most novel develcp
4. ment of artistic photography. It
can scarcely be called a photograph. It
is rather a portrait made by a. combina
tion of t'ae camera and the brush.
The woman who sits for her photo
sketch obtains an absolute likeness of
herself. And yet she beholds herself not
as she Is, but as she longs to be. All the
Idealism of the artist has been blended"
with the matter of fact lens. She may
pose In the plainest of govras, yet in the
photo sketch appear in the most bewitch
ing' of costumes.
In the photo sketch a platinum print is
made of the head of the subject from the
negative. So far it Is photography pure
and simple. The likeness Is absolute.
Then the brush of the artist comes into
play. "With it he fashions for my lady
the gown she most desires, or in which
his taste and judgment tell him she will
appear to most advantage. With It he
gives her . the figure she would have had
had nature been most kind. Sometimes"
he may sketch from life, in order the bet
ter to catch the personality of his subject.
or when my lady has a gown In which she
particularly desires to be seen. More often
6he simply describes one which suits her
taste or leaves the matter entirely to the
artist's fancy.
The figure Is generally purely ideal. Al
ways it is idealized. And yet the likeness
Is unmistakable. No one can deny it is
xny lady's portrait
The woman with a perfect figure is sel
iom found in nature. For such a one.
however, the negative is reproduced in
full, and sufficient outline of the body is
left to guide the artist. All undesired
parts of the photograph are faded from
the print before the brush work begins,
eo that no shadow of the portrait appears
beneath It. This Is accomplished by a
mechanical process known only to its dis
coverer. What It is the earnest amateur
may find out by experiment. It Is a nut
he must crack before he may become a
photo-sketcher.
Not a photographer In a hundred could
become one even then. He must also be
en artist and a master of his art. The
platinum prints are easy of production.
The drawing is the important and difficult
part of this new departure in photog
raphy. It is never reproduced. Its beau
tiful, eketchy effect jvould be lost in the
process. Every copy must be done by
hand and each, except in the face, may
be entirely different from the others. The
beautiful photo sketches reproduced on
this page are the work of Marion of New
York.

WHAT CAN
BE DONE
WITH A
BRUSH AND A
CAMERAFor Theresa had learned that love Is
akin to pity, and joy is often to be found
in sadness.
"Dick." she said pleadingly, "don'tâ
don't you understand? I â I â oh. but don't
you understand?" She touched the scar
red cheeks with her lips.
Dick did understand, and so did Walter
when he came back to the room.
But she took no heed. A sudden ex
citement had seized her. "Well, tt's not
true now. Dick: it's not true now."
She sank beside him and he put out
his hands, and toudhed the tears on tha
woman's cheeks.

agony in the face. -**'*â¢

Maitland Hall inâ in the summer."

Walter Fairbank went off to look at tha
horses. x
The girl stood before the blind man. He
was smiling quietly. The tears flooded her
eyes and a great yearning took possession
of her.
"Are youâ you there. Miss Fairbanks
Dick asked. \
"Yes."
"Where?" . â¢ -
"Here." She went to him and rested
her hand upon h!s shoulder.
Towards dusk her brother came home,
his face lined 'with pain as though he had
suddenly grown old. ,.;~
All day she wandered " disconsolately.
EVery servant whir came back from the
farm she questioned. She wanted to run
over herself, but her brother had f<vbid
den it. She" hated the sun because it was
shining so brightly, she thought the birds
were cruel for chirruping in the trees.
.Theresa knelt by the. couch and wept.
She didn't know why she wept. .Perhaps
it was only the pity in her heart. She
had never cared for Richard Sparling, but
for him to die like thisâ it was terrible."
She watched them go with aching heart;
she sent her maid 6ver to find out some
news, but the answer she brought was
that the poor gentleman^ was dying.
She did not plead further. Some of the
men . servants went back with Walter to
the farm.- ' .'â¢!Â¦ .; Â¦...'Â¦ ' ." -,>Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦ * Â¦ ..; "> Â¦

"Oh, but, Walter, I could tell howâ how
dreadfully sorry I am." -
VYau.. could- tell- him nothing; -he's un

, Unable to speak, unable to decide what
to do, Theresa stood with blanched, plain
tive countenance..
"Canâ can I," she said with tearful
voice, "can I go to him?"
All through the service she was like one
dazed. . She found herself in a reverie
thinking of "a time when she used to
search the ditches by the meadows for
rare weeds. But during the special prayer
prayer of the old vicar. she pulled down
her veil. The tears were running too fast.
It was then that she turnÂ«d to look
through the mist at Dick Sparling.
It wasn't like the face she had once
known. It was horrible, and the closed
Â«*j-C3 were hid behind dim glasses. The
Sli<? was aware of her brother opening
the pew door, aware of a trembling, weak
figure being led into a seat by her side.
She dared not turn her bead to look, but
she put out her hand and took that of the
stricken man. She tried to say something,
but words would not come. The man's
hand was shaking.. .
She kept her eyes on the ground.
There was a slight commotion at the
church door. Everybody turned to look
and there was whispering.
ShÂ«- muttered a soft '"Yes" and on the
Sunday they drove to Thirwell. She had
often been In the quaint, stunt-towered
church before, but she felt a swelling at
her bosom and her breath came quick as
she walked to the Sparlmg pew alone, for
Walter had gone to meet his, friend. She
knew all the villagers were looking at her,
but she cared not for their looks. *
She was. afraid, however, they would
hear the beating- of her heart.
For Theresa had learned that Sove is akin to pity.
"poor Dick is bearing It wonderfully well.
This mcrnlng he was quite cheery and
actually laughed. And on Sunday there
is to be a service of thanksgiving in the
little village church that his life was not
lost. Will you go?"
She was in a soft white morning gown
that set off her sweet beauty. She wij>hod
them both good sport during the day, gave'
an eye to their accouterments, and, stand
ing at the hall door, waved them a merry
adieu. , ...''â¢
"Thessy's jovial ' this morning," said
Walter, as they walked down the aveuue
.with guns across their shoulders. 1 Â¦}Â¦.,
In the morning, at breakfast table, The

chattered gaily and the two men laughed.
"Well, you can "use one of the guns

we can get out early.".
"Oh, but my guns are not in condition."
"And I'm glad of it, old man," said
Walter, reaching forward - for another
cigar, "for my mind is now at rest. What
are you doing to-morrow? - Why 'not. let
us have some shooting together?"

Squire Fairbank attempted to chat gaily
for a* few minutes. But all the time he
was filled with hot anger. He understood
his friend's discomfort and was irritated
at the sudden haughtiness of Theresa. "
When Dick Sparling had" ridden on he
turned almost savagely.

Within a^week, as she and- Walter were
taking horse exercise down Thirwell road,
they encountered Sparling.
Thirwell was but some four miles from
Maitland Hall. Indeed the two estates
joined. It was impossible therefore that
long time could pass before Theresa met
her rejected lover. V
Fairbank was for some days openly an
noyed at the conduct of his sister. Tak
ing a personal interest in his estates, he
had a mixture of scorn- and mirth for
Theresa's affectations of culture.' He
knew her to be just what she was, pretty
and vain; not heartless or insincere, but,
with the unthinking buoyancy of young
womanhood, taking the world to be her
playground.
She had neve.- loved him. Indeed she
cared a good deal less for him than many
another man she knew in the south coun
try. She was amused at his amiable fol
lowing of her into the mysteries of
Browning, which she didn't understand.
His docile obedience, his unhidden admir
ation, pleased her. Had she been other
than a light-hearted, frivolous girl' she
would have seen the personal advantages
of becoming the mistress of Thirwell.
But these had no weight with her. She
had her triumph .in the knowledge that
she had brought the richest man in the
shire to ji protestation. Thoughtless anJ
merry, it never entered her mind that her
amusement might be the cause of pain.
the same age as Waiter, a kind-hearted,
sincere country gentleman who knew,
though nothing had been said, that for
him to marry Theresa would bring joy
into the heart of his chum. And so he
had loved and Theresa had coquetted, and
then suddenly, this afternoon, matters
had been brought to a climax.
stant v/inning smile, her tall graceful car
riage, had set aglow the heart of many a
man.
Yet she was an arrant flirt. Not that
she exchanged sweet sighs with would
be lovers, but she delighted in her powers
of fascination. To have a hoet of admir
ers, to feel that her wish was their law,
to see the love in their, eyes which she
was careful should never have an oppor
tunity of being spoken, and yet caring
not one jot for any of them, -such was
the desire of Theresa Fairbank. the sister
of the young Squire of Maitland Hall.
Her great conquest 'had been Richard
Sparling of Thlrwell, the life-long friend
of her brother. Sparling was rich, about
violently in love with you?"
"I didn't." â¢
"And you've refused him."
"I have, for I don't love him. I don't
like little men. and Mr. Sparling is a little
man."
"That's because you yourself are so
tall." :
There was silence for some moments.
Then the brother spoke again: "Look
here, Thessy, don't be an idiot. Sparlings
a very decent chap. Besides, he's just
about six times as well off as we are.
Thlrwell is a lovely place: he's got a nice
town house; you would have everything
a woman can desire, and yoVi'd search a
mighty long time before you'd get so in
dulgent a husband."
"You're his friend. Walter." said The
resa, suggestively, looking up for the first
time.
"I am, and when I saw what was hap
pening I was glad. Now do be sensible.
If I were asked to pick you a husband I
would pick you Dick Sparling."
"But you're not asked. And when
there's any picking to be done, I'll do it
myself."
"Then a'.l I can say is you're a heart
less flirt. You've flirted with Dick abom
inably."
Theresa laughed softly- "Oh. do finish,
Mr. Crcssbones." she said, "and don't lec
ture. Mr. Sparling will no doubt soon re
cover from hisâ his infatuation, and then
we will all be friends' again."
"You make a mistake if you think Dick
that sort of man. I'm sorry for him, and
I'm ashamed of you." .
Then he went out and left the girl In
the room alone.
As soon as she heard Walter whistle
for his deg, which indicated he was off
for a walk, Theresa threw aside her bon
net and. leaning back in the big yielding
.chair, laughed merrily.
No man could ever look upon her with
out being captivated. The soft, warm
tinted skin, telling of constant life in the
country: the full, - inviting lips; the soft
and yet often kindling eyes, the mass of
black hair, her ingenuousness, her con- 1

"Of ccurse, I saw ycu both under

"You saw nothing of the kind."
She stood by the window with the warm
afternoon light flooding abcut her head
and shoulders, a beautiful young woman
In a bright summer garb. There was a
deeper touch of color in her cheek than
usual. She was agitated, the breath v.-as

lips, and the rise and fall of the diaphan

excitement. >_
Her brother twisted round on the couch.
where he had been yawning through a
novel. "What's up?" he repeated.
"Mr.â Mr. Sparling has just proposed to
me. and I have told him it can never be."
"You've rejected him!"
She nodded her head.
Walter crossed the dca wing-room, a
burJy. ruddy cheeked Saxon, and stared in
the face of his lovely sister.
"Tbessy." he said, "you're an awful
ass."
"I knew you would say that," replied
the woman.
"Any girl would Jump at a man like
Eparling."
"Well. I haven't," and she commenced
to pick the leaves from a butch of blown
roseÂ«i and place them in a Jar.
The room was partly darkened to keep
out the rays of the sun. But through the
French windows that opened upon the
lawn, where the buzz of bees could be
heard among the flowers that skirted the
paths, then* came long beams of light that
fell about Theresa Fairbank as though
they sought to glorify her loveliness.
Walter pitched his novel away, and
looked curiously at the girl as she bent
over the bowl of roses.
"You know Dick Sparling is a particu
lar friend of mine." he said with the
faintest touch of anger in his voice.
"I know." said the eirl.
"Then why on earth did you encourage
i"l never encouraged him." Â»~
"Fudge! Nobody wilh half an eye could
have mistaken what Sparling was after;
you, least of all, with your talks together
about Browning and ethics, and your
searching together for rare British weeds
â as though Sparling cared a. rap for those
things."
"Then I misunderstood Mr. Sparling."
"Not you; no girl could. Do you mean
to say you didn't know all along Dick was
Â¦
"Do give over" talking in that stilted
way. Dick's far too sensible to run away,
andâ and look here, Theresa, you'll live to
rue the day. that you refused him."
"'Pray don't try coercion."
"I won't. It's not for me to force you
to marry a man whom you don't love,
but it is for me to remonstrate against
ycur putting my dearest friend into a
position* almost ridiculous." The horses
broke into a canter. "Andâ and I'm going
to have Dick at. the hall as much as be
foreâif he'll come."
"If he'll come," repeated the girl. .
"Oh Iâ I daresay his affection willâ will
smolder away pretty quickâ quick enough,
when he sees how worthâ worthless is the
person on whom he bestowedâ stowed It."
â¢ Theresa tossed her head and deigned
no notice.
And it was as young Squire Fairbank
foretold. The friendship of the two men
was not interrupted by the coquetry of
the sister, fe At first Sparling hesitated
running the risks of meeting her. But
as Sparling's love waned, for he saw it
had been but a flitting fancy nurtured by
his esteem for the girl's brother, so Ther

quivered.
She followed Dick and her brother from
the church.
"Whereâ where Is Miss Fairbank?" tot
man asked with a tremor in his voica.
"Here." said Theresa, placing her hand
on his arm.
"Ah. yes, forgive me. But we'll Â»3
three go up to the Hall and have lunch.
Yes, yes. Watt, I can walk; really I'm
4juite strong enough to walk itâ it M1Â«J
Fairbank will give me her arm as well.
They sauntered up the village street ta
the gaunt Elizabethan' mansion, in whlcb
the Sparlings had long lived. Dick WU
-merry; the others- had hearts too full ta
eay much.
"What a helpless old cripple I am, am
I not," said Dick apologetically when hiÂ»
foot hit against a stone. "But It's not â¢â¢
bad as you might â might "
He stopped, for he instinctively felt thÂ«
man and the woman by his side werÂ»
pained.
They walked across the lawn, with ltÂ»
cold, damp grass, and slowly climbed thÂ«
old stone steps. _ .
Once in the drawing room Dick Sparllnx
sank back with exhaustion.
"It's nothing, nothing," he Â»aid. "Oh,
I'm getting all right amazingly quick. And
how have you been. Miss Fairbank?"
"I've â I've been very well, thank yoa.' #
It was a commonplace answer, but sha
could not find another. She wanted to say;
He sank down into the nearest chair,
and, covering his face with ' nis hamls,
sobbed bitterly.
â¢ "He's notâ not dead, but it's â it's uwful.
That gun of mine I lent him, it â it explod
ed. Weâ we've carried him to theâ to the
farm, j Gray has ridden off for a doctor,
and I want handkerchiefs and lint andâ oh
my poor pal, Dick!"
.Walter was pale with excitement.
"Dick," he gasped, "has beenâ been rhot."
s Theresa uttered a- scream, and held to
the table for support.
"Mercy!" she exclaimed, "what is it?"
Many minutes she stood musing, and
then suddenly she saw her brother run
ning breathlessly and excitedly up the
drive.-
His' cap was off; he had no. gun with
him.
She hastened Into the hall.
She rose from the piano. and, going to
the window, looked out upon the glowing
scene of autumn. The plantation, away
over by the home farm, was a mass of
gorgeous tints and burnished gold, but In
a few weeks there would be nothing but a
dark array of bare trees. She thought of
this with a sigh, for she loved the sum
mer and the autumn, the songs of the
birds and the breath of the flowers.
Neither her brother nor his, friend would
be back for some hours. She had all the
morning to herself, to play her music, to
spend an hour in the conservatory among:
the flowers, to look into the kitchen and
see the husekeeper. , Â¦
Theresa watched, the men out, of sight.
Then, humming- an air, she went to the
drawing-room Â¦ and played some .of her
favorite Chopin. She was free hearted
this bright, keen-aired autumn day.
Everything in the world was so pleasant
that she sang for Joy* of heart. Â¦ - \ .
"Tes," muttered Dick, and he offered hu.
friend a. cigarette. , ..Â¦'â¢'
ly he gained strength, but there was no
hope he would ever see again. That v^aa
beyond hope.
"Thessy," said Walter one afternoon,
-Waiter. Walter." she beseeched., "is he
Â«*t)lngr to die?" *--'." . ...
"No," he said sadly, "the doctors don t
, nlnk he'll die. but It will be worse than
5eath. far worse. His face Is all torn and
âand. Theesy, he'll never see any more.
â¢'Blind 1" ,
Her brother nodded. He forced bacK a
sob, and the girl came to him and nestled
close to his side. He did not quite appre
ciate her presence, but he stroked her wet
cheeks with his hand.
At last he raised his head and looked at
her. â¢ â¢
"Thessy," he said, "Dick will be no good
now. He'll be a cripple, his face will bo
seared and scarred, he'll have to crawl
through life a blind man. Now. now. don t
you take it so hardly.- Think, you might
have been his-hls wife! Then It would
have been terrible. But you've been saved
that agony, Thessy. How much worse. It
would be were you married to him! It
would have killed him with sorrow. I
didn't think so at the time, but It's well
you didn't marry him. Now, now, don't
cry, the doctors say there is practically no
fear of him dying, only that he'llâ he'll be
âbeâ"
"Always blind," said Theresa, her dis
tress shaking her with Its Intensity.
The next day she went over to the farm.
But neither the nurses nor the medical
men would permit her to see the patient.
Others went with stealthy step In and out
of the room, but she was prohibited.
Walter marveled at the great pity there
was in the heart of his sister.
He was racked with pain, thinking of
the sad fatÂ© of his friend. Day by day
he saw his sister grow paler and more
wan. She ceased to be the "? frolicsome,
venturous girl, ever rippling with merri
ment, and became a demure, anxious
woman.
She rarely spoke about the blind man,
but her brother could see the disaster had
left its mark.
And so the weeks slowly dragged along
and Richard Sparling was taken from the
farm to his own house at Thlrwell. Slow-

8"as moonlight unto sunlight and as water

to man a thing apart"? I asked her.
"The idea." she reiterated: "as if wo
men didn't do all the loving there is don*
in this world!"
"Ah!" Â»
"Perhaps I shouldn't say quite all," ah*
added. "Of course, there do exist a few,
a very few noble men- who are capable of
great love and great sacrifice for a wo
man because they are truly noble and
could under no circumstances be anything
else. But they are so rare that they are
hardly worth considering In laying down
general laws. They are only the excep
tion that has to be to prove the rule.
"But as for womenâ they love to love.
They will give their lives to men who
don't care for them more than for a doff.
I believe they even love to be abused by
the object of their adoration. A woman's
life Is all sacrifice, all devotion to the man
whom she loves. She will let herself b*
walked over. There is no limit to what
she will suffer for the man of her choice."
"Have you ever seen perfect love â mu
tually perfect love?"
"Yes; and it was the most beautiful
thing in the world-^but it didn't last. Per
fect things never do. While two peopla
are loving each other they are living ab
solutely perfect iives for the time. But
it's no use for a woman to expect it to
continue. A man doesn't know the mean
ing of the word love in an absolute and
lasting sense. He isn't capable of thÂ«
sacrifice which love involves.
"I sometimes think that women arÂ»
happier being unhappy in love than they
would be if it were all smooth sailing. A
woman enjoys suffering.
"The reason that she does so much
more of it than a man is that love Is her
business in life. Men live broader lives
and the perspective is changed accord
ingly."
"I think I've got that down In good or

Miss Walford of St. Luke's Hospital
NurÂ«es know in the same way that doc
tors do. Perhaps they know. better, being
women. Take the intuition of their sex
and combine it with their opportunities
for studying human nature and they
ought to have learned.
Miss Walford struck me as so gentle In
manner that I was all the time surprised
at the keen way she showed of looking
things through.
"Do you find that men are devoted to
their wives through sickness?" I asked
her.
â¢ very much so. Nearly all men are.
Their sense of duty is very strong."
"Ah! That's another point. The ques
tion really is. Do men love as well as
women? Duty Isn't love."
"No, and therein lies a big difference
that I have noted. I don't think women
sacrifice themselves for a man, devota
themselves to him in sickness, unless they
love him. On the other hand, a man will
devote himself to a woman through his
â¢sense of duty, even though love doesn't
enter in. I have one in mind now. Ha
nursed his wife with the tenderest car*
through a long sickness. He spared no
expense in doing all for her that could be.
done, although he could ill afford it. and
all the time I don't think he cared a pin
about her. A woman in the same cir
cumstances would not have done that.*
She must love a man to be good to him."
"And do women love less than men?"
"I don't think so. I don't think they
love as hard, although I have seen soms
that were volcanoes; but as a rule thÂ«
man is the one who feels the more intense
passion.
"A woman Iove3 longer, though. ShÂ»
has the stability, man the intensity."
Mrs. Arthur Cornwall of the Red
Cross Society and the California
N Club Thinks Men Are Bet
ter Than They Are-
Believed to Be.
Mrs. Cornwall insisted that she didn't
know anything about the affections.
Her looks belied her.
"I know a great deal about men,
though," she said. "A great deal morÂ«
than I do about women. For although
I'm a club woman. I have had more deal
ings with men than with my own sex.
The Red Cross has taught me a lot"
"What has It taught ycu about men la
their affections?" I coaxed, but she was
not to be trapped.
"I don't know anything about their af
fections," she persisted, "but a great deal
about their character. ' They arÂ« better
than they are half believed to be. I Hk*
men."
"Do yon find their affections more last
ing than those of women?"
"That I don't know. I don't know any
thing about the versus of the matter. I
only know what men are. They are tre
mendously stable. They are loyal
friends."
"llore than women?**
"I can't say."
"Are they Intense In fettling?"
"They are not emotional, but they arÂ«
stable, reliable."
"Are women emotional?"
"Very emotional. That much I know.
Our emotions must be played upon all
the time to keep us amused. We must
be diverted with something new."
"And we need new playthings for our
affections?"
"No, no, I don't believe that. I admire
and respect women. I am a club woman,
myself. All I say Is that I don't know
so much about them as I do about men.
What I know of them i3 nearly all good."
Men stable but not emotional; women
emotional but notâ no. she didn't say that.
However, she has laid down laws that axe
general and ought to apply specifically to
the affections. Why not?
If men are stable, -reliable by nature,
they must be lasting and true In their
affections. If they are not emotional,
they cannot be intense. If women ara
emotional in a vacillating way, why not
the same in love affairs?
But remember, Mrs. Cornwall did not
draw any of these conclusions. These arÂ»
the reader's. She was characterizing far
more generally.
For she says fiat she doesn't know any
thing about the affections â that big
hearted woman who has slaved In ths
slavery, of the Red Cross labors, carrying
a big share of the brunt of the work for ;

and weighed deliberately.
Dr. McNutt received the problem as he
might receive a puzzling case of apppn
dicitis. It was to be considered seriously
"This is *" very interesting and very
deep," he launched out slowly. "It is a
question to require much time . and
thought." .
"But try something offhand." I urged.
"It's the kind of a subject, too, that one
knows almost as" much about offhand as
after study."
"But it involves too many conditions to
be treated in a hurry," he insisted.
"In sickness, what do you see?" I hur
ried on. "Is a man more faithful to a
suffering wife than she to him?"
"The doctor pondered. The doctor dis
cussed, more with himself than with me.
And he finally came to the conclusion
that it is all a matter of the tempera
ment of the individual, and that, speaking
generally, the matter is nip and tuck.
"I have seen sickness bring out all the
worst traits in both men and women," he
said. .."I have seen those husbands and
wives who have been loving enough in the
smooth waters of life shew gross neglect
and disloyalty when the life. partner was
suffering and ill.
"And I have seen just the opposite. I
have seen times of distress bring out the
most beautiful qualities of tenderness and
loyalty. I have seen big, rough husbands
turn nurse and take care of a sick wife
with a tenderness that only true love
could have taught them. And as for
wives â 'Oh, woman! in our hours of
ease ' "
He was caught there, and I hastened to
rescue him, for I saw that the dear old
doctor had warmed to a very pretty sen
timentality of the old school, and his
mood had its charm.
"Yes â "a ministering angel thou," " he
repeated.
"There's another point about ill health,"
he went on. "Love, as I have said, some
times weakens when the object of the love
Is ill. Illness weakens love in another
wayâ the one suffering often loves less.
Emotions are apt to be weaker in a per
son of weak physique.'j
There's something to think about*
P. J. McCormick, the Chief Deputy
Coroner, Has Something
to Say.
/The Coroner wasn't in. The chief dep
uty was, and I told him he woulddo. He
was having his picture taken and I
waited.
"I wonder if you'd mind letting me look
pleasant at you?" he inquired, dolefully.
"This is a hard place to get up a smile
in."
"Yes, I guess I see trouble enough to
know something about the affections," he
went on -when the matter was explained
to him. "Murders for love, suicides for
love. I guess I ought to know a thing or
two. . t
"More women, I should say, ' -without
looking over the records, far more women
commit suicide for love than men. To be
sure, there are no doubt many men whose
cause of suicide is assigned as something
else when in reality it is love that is the
indirect cause. Financial affairs often ap
pear to be, while love is at the bottom of
the trouble. A woman does not have
financial affairs to serve as an excuse.
But, even so, there are more women who
suicide for love, I am sure.
"Women are more impulsive. Time will
heal any pain, and a man realizes this
better, and gives time a chance. Woman
does not. '' ,
"More murders for love are probably
committed by men. A man puts the other
one out of business; a woman gets rid of
herself. But very likely these murders
are often no indication of real love â only
a spiteful Jealousy.
"But does anybody think of doubting
that women love better than men? How
can they? To me there is no doubt. I
tell you, if a fellow's in trouble it's a
woman that he wants to comfort him. If
he's sick, it's a pity for him if he has to
do with a man for a nurse. It's a woman's
affection he wants. Of course they love
better than men. And I'm called an au
thority on love affairs, too."
Mrs. E. G. Denniston, President of
the Forum Club, Is
Neutral.
Mrs. Dennlston is president of a pros
perous club, mingles in prosperous so
ciety, and receives in a prosperous home.
Her point of view is a very different one
from those of the men who have watched
love through its trials of sin and sickness
and poverty. Her view is that of a hap
pily housed woman.' Â«
She sounds so, too. She doesn't talk
much abcut the heart breakings and dis
loyalties. She concerns" herself with the
loyalties.
"I think women are just as affectionate
as men, and that men are just as affec
tionate as women," she said. "I have
seen the most beautiful cases of lifelong
devotion on both sides."
*'Does a man love the more intensely?"
"I don't think so. Of course convention
ality permits him to show his feeling first,
to express himself."
"Does he love longer?"
"I don't think that, either.. I don't think
stability Is a question of sex."
"And t;o sum up?"
"I think it all depends on the Individual.
There are both kinds of women and both
kinds of men. I don't think either sex
loves better.
"There ought to be more happiness on
both sides in the future," she went on.
It was the club woman speaking. "Women
are so much 'more independent, aad there
fore marry later in life. \
"I suppose they are the same women
at hesirt." she added.

KATHEYN MAESH;
Judge Carroll Cook Thinks That
Women Carry Off the
Prize.
IT struck me that Judge Cook was a
very good man to start out with. Ho
ought to have two points of view;
that of the criminal lawyer and judge
who has watched the crime-bound
emotions of men 'and women, and that of
the recently married man.
Perhaps the latter is what made him a
bit diffident about' expressing his mind. I
noticed a certain diffidence with all Ihe
married ones, for. that matter. Perhaps
they have begun to realize how little tliey
knoW about it all, anyway.
"I couldn't sayâ I really couldn'tâ I
don't know anything about it," he in
sisted. According to the trick of his trade
he had me backed against a lighted wall
while he was between me and the window
and I couldn't see him clearly.
"Buf surely you have some ideas on the
subject. Do more men or more women
sue for divorce?"
"More" women."
"What does that indicate? That they
are more fickle, or that fickleness on their
husbands' part has prompted suit?"
â¢ "Couldp't say." .
."Which commit . more murders for
love?"
"Far more, men." â¢ â¢ V .
"Because they love better?"
"No; because Â¦women are too timid to
kill."
"Although they may love as much?"
"Oh, I don't know. I really don't know
anything about it. But I'll tell you. I
think that women carry off the prize for
affection every timeâ if you want to know
what I think."
Which was exactly what I did want.
Seme Things That a Minister Has to
Say on the Subject.
When Father Parrish opened to me the
door of his famous basement he had just
emerged from a wedding. I waded to
him through inches of rice and stumbled
over ah old shoe at the threshold. It
looked as if he might be in a frame of
mind to discuss the affections.
"Ministers ought to know human nature
if anybody does," I said/ "You see the
great crises of life, the times when love
is put to the .test. Which loves betterâ
man or woman?"
"Oh, woman, woman, beyond a doubt,
woman," was what he exclaimed offhand.
But ha begged to be permitted to write
ouf his opinions on the subject instead of
being interviewed. I gave him several
days to do it in, and you see that by the
time he had thought the matter over he
wasn't so sure. Here is what he wrote:.
By Father Herbert Panish.
Most people remembering Nancy Sykes
would probably give the palm to woman's
long-suffeiing affection for man. I see,
however, that in the divorce statistics a
large majority of the" suits- for separation
are begun by women. This may not prove
anything. Still it is interesting. ,
In regard to the psychological difference
between ir.cn and women you must con
sult an expert. There Is said to be some
thing in the maternal instinct which may
account for the patience shown by some
women. for tKe nren everybody else would
hate. I remember that Professor Baris
Sldls in his work on the psychology of
suggestion says that, women can rarely
rise above the tribe and are Philistines
by nature. But this is a hard saying.
Ideally -thera should be an equality at
least in the durability if not in the quality
and capacity of the affections of each sex.
As a matter of fact the general depend
ence of women upon men puts a compul
sion upon loyalty.
In her judgment of the man a woman is
handicapped. She lacks experience,- and
at. the marriageable age idealizes absurd
ly. Her imagination make3 a king of. a
cad. Later on, when sho sees more of the
world and finds the type reiterated or dis
covers from experience that she has made
a mistake, she >s apt to rush to the other
extreme. Then she decides to get a di
vorce or joins a strong-minded woman's
club. '
Men, on the other hand, with wider ex
perience in the world, have less imagina
tion in affairs of the heart. With them
disenchantment is less disastrous.
Problem Pro and
Con.
I should say, however, that too often in
both sexes affection is only a species of
blind idolatry. It is foolish in its incep
tion and fatal to happiness of a per
manent order in its result. The golden
rule says" that we should love our neigh
bor as ourself.- Most people violate this
rule by loving the majority of their neigh
bors a good deal less than themselves and
by loving some of their neighbors a good,
deal more Â¦ than themselves.;. I. do not
think that women, are any worse than
men in loving "not wisely but too -well."

Whether rich, or poor, there is no reason why your home
should not be made beautiful by artistic arrangement and
tlie proper outlay of time and energymore than by. the expenditure
of money. Correspondence is invited. Just address your letters to
Kate Greenleaf Locke, Sunday Call, and these questions on making
the home artistic will be answered at length in subsequent columns
of this department.
IT Is one thin* to furnish a home
Ideally when you' can order In profes

There are plenty of Â¦ times when you
tcant to give up In despair because you
have to put up with dismally high cell-
Ings, dark rooms, bareness of outline.
Your bouse, perhaps, was built with no
regard for beauty. And you feel very
much like saying, "There's, no useâ It
never can be artistic, anyway." . -

It may take much time and study to bet

I* D. writes be follows: "We have just
finished building a house which is very
artistic in design." I will be very grateful
for suggestions from you as to- the fur
nishing of the living-room. This room is
18x20, the ceilings are low and heavily
beamed with oak, the floor is polished oak
finish and the side walls are In rough
plaster. The windows, of which there are
four, r.re all casement style; with deep
sills. One, a long one in the north, Is of
amber glass leaded 5n. The chimney
breast is tiled with a deep shade of yel

these things I. would . like :a ; different

Turkish rug for the center of the floor
which has a, good deal of dull blue in it,

color shall I paint the walls and what
style of furniture shall I buy?"

of this unique and beautiful room, run

amber glass, etc. At your windows hang
two straight scarfs of this silk of a deep,
golden yellow. Draw these back to fall

other side hang a looped-back curtain or

leads from the hall hang a single curtain
of dull blue, lined on the parlor side wltn

THE HOUSE BEAUTIFULTHE SUNDAY CALL.
11
THIS is tne second of a series of
articles being published by Tb a
Sunday Call in the interest of
cnarit} as exemplified by those char
itable institutions of San Francisco
controlled by women.
These papers are written by the
presidents of the different orgar
izations and therefore can be relied
upon as accurate in detail.
Coming from such sources of au
thority they cannot fail to awaken
interest among the many readers -who
know, in a general way, that, good
work is being done, yet lack specific
information as to how, where and by
whom.
The present interesting paper on
the San Francisco Fruit and Flower
Mission is by Miss Muriel Weinple,
the president of that organization.
Next week will appear an article
â¢ by the president of the Maria Kip
Orphanage on the condition of that
charitv end the good it has accom
plished.
Sy Muriel &)2mp!e.
FLOWER Mission work in San Fran
cisco originated in 1879, when a
number of the members of the
Toung Women's Christian Associa
tion conceived the idea of carrying
fruit and" flowers to the hospitals and to
'he sick in the tenement houses of the
rlty. They were made a committee by the
tresident if the association, but at the
close of the year asked permission to form
an organization of their own, nnd in 1880
the San Francisco Fruit and Flower Mis
sion, with Miss Mary Bates as president,
began a work of active charity that has
extended over twenty years.
There are no paid officers, and many a
worker has lovingly given her entire time,
counting it no sacrifice. !
In the beginning of the^work the spirit
of the mission was 'entirely in the personal
visit, the fruit and flowers being nails
to hang it on, as it were. The idea of the
visit has remained the same through all
the years, but the fruit and flowers are a
very small feature of the mission's dis
tributions. The name Is so suergestlve of
sentimental limitations that the mission
would correct the prevalent and errone
ous impression that the work is on no
more practical lines than fruit and flow
ers suggest. "Fruit and Flower Mission."
a physician exclaimed recently â "Flowers
in a sickroom! Bah!"
Think of the inconsistency of putting
a pansy away to die in loneliness, while
a leaky sewer sends out a million mi
crobes a minute! ?
Early in the mission's history visiting
was done in the hospitals.' but now It is
confined to the invalids in their homes.
The organization Is entirely non-sectarian
in membership and benevolence. There is
no sccial element in the mission work
just the lovely- spirit of harmony among:
people working for a common good. ~ The
active members are young women who
might send their grocer to the needy and
sit back in ldle'indifference if they would,
but they prefer to make the people their
friends. They do it in a delicate, tactful
way, and cJiarlty is spelled love among'
them.
The number of cases cared for averages
thirty. Practically, that means a great
many more. If there are children, they
must all be clothed. Very often the in
valid Is the bread winner and the family
must be tided over the time of illness. '
These cases come to the mission in va
rious ways. Sometimes a member of the
family calls, and it is always a pitiful
tale. They hear of the mission through
their neighbors, or "Johnnie read some
thing in the paper about yousc helping
folks." Then letters are sentâ pathetic at
tempts, most of them. Frequently other*
jistitutions report cases requiring the del
icacies the mission provides. In almost
every instance the name is handed to tho
Associated Charities for Investigation. â¢ If
on receiving ths report the president con
siders taking the case, she makes a per
sonal visit- to see the conditions and dis
cover the particular needs. When the
name is added to the list the sick one- 'is
taken into the mission family and cared
for tenderly. The system of investigation
does away with fraud3, and inasmuch as
money is never given the wayfarer finds
little satisfaction in his appeal.
Not infrequently reepeetable looking
men call at the mission in desperate need
of work. It is' impossible to direct them
and feel confident that anything wii: come
of it It would seem as though- there Is
something wrong in the scheme of things
when no definite provision can be made
for such men.
In the unpretentious little cottage at 631
Butter street the household affairs of the
are conducted. It is there, on
every Thursday morning:, that aj bright,
cheery looking girls gather to have their
baskets filled v/ith good, substantial pro
vision*. The cynic may regard those bas
kets as an unnecessary badge of thought
ful care. He probably never has lifted
one. It is working. pretty hard to look
picturesque.
The provisions are. everything from
clothing to the dnintiest delicacy. The
store- closet ir, /â¢_'â *uetcd on* a wonderful'
system. Sugar, rice and meal are kept.
In .bins and packed in bags that
hold Â¦ a week's supply. Each basket
is filled with these", as well as po
tatoes, tea. . flour, coffee: frrpÂ«Â». soup,
wine jelly, custards, beef extract, con
densed milk and sherry or port as the
physician prescribes it. Other jfUi^s and
fruits, fresh rr. canned, are Riven out.
Some discrimination is made, in third's-'
tribution, the cases' receiving thn delica
cJ.es they moat icqulre. In many instances
milk is sent every day, and fuel is fre
quently provided. â¢ . *
The diet k'tchen is an important feature
of the work. . There i? a well-ein'r>T) C rl
kitchen, and every- Wednesday afterroon^
a committee of capable p'rls make jellies,
custards or whatever si'gpests itself to
them. They enter Into It with. an enthu
siasm that would silence the cynic for
ever.
'There, is a cl^then . closet filled with
garments that have been slightly worn.
.There are Infants' outfits, and children
of every age Â«re provided for. There are
new gaj-mentsâ flannels, sheets, towels,
and the like. Many of these are voted to
the mission by the Needlework Guild
each year.

cf v/ithercd th r ng3 and heard the plan
tivc explanation: "I couldn't bear to
throw* 'em out. Dearie." Flowers play a
lovely part in the work, but in very seri
ous cases they nre given no thought.
Save these of contagion, all the ills
(hat men. women and children are heir
to have been catalogued in the mission.
Sometimes Improvidence seems the cause
of the^uiJlress, and sometimes an accu
mulation of misfortunes â and children.
There are chronic cases that have been
on the Mat for years. The mission's af
fairs are theirs, and the marriage of a
president is a matter for their personal
concern. It is in cases of this sort that
the visit counts for so t " much. Their
weeks begin and end 'with Thursday.
One invalid who has lain in bed for
years and has a face like. a flower that
has bloomed in the shade In full of prtt
ty drollery and wit. She thinks, of get-Y
ting a guest book, she says, because all
of her visitors are lovely and there can
be no distinction save in the name.
It is not only the ccarse intellects that
the visitors meet. Refined, gentle peo
ple also seek their care and friendship.
There was an instance of unusual and
extreme need. Both mother . and child
were ill and other little ones. were unpro
vided for. . When -the visitor callqd and j
recognized "an old schoolmate she hesi
tated in the embarrassment of having
made what semned to be a mistake. It
was a trying moment, but a womanly
girl's gentle tact left a sensitive pride un
hurt. They talked of care free days and
half forgotten experiences, and the pain
seemed easii'r and life more worth while
to the sufferer.
This work among the sick reaches every
heart somehow. A Etranger will call at
the mission with a Uisket and explain
that she has been ill herself, and knew
just how pleasant it war. to be thought
of, or just how good a particular jell>
tasted. -Dellverymen who know nothing
of the people nre Interested in the num
ber of Pick, and will tell how such a on*
In the family had pneumonia," but "pulled
out all right." " The disconsolate and th"Â»
weak are everywhere In the world, and
on: this common pround . of misery and
pa'n class distinctions are forgotten.
In the visiting the gir's are often en
curaged to keep up their- languages.
There Is a representative of almost every
rat'ona'lty in the mission's family. A
pentle Snanlsh greeting has made many
n Ir-terless brown eye .young- again.
Trrubles told in German have lost a
we'rM of woe. There is no place for a
morbid nature in the work. There is too
much real suffering, and the visitor's
sunshine should obscure the misery.
The mission's support is in membership
subscriptions of . twenty-five, cents or
more a month. An appeal is made just
crce a year. Â¦ 'That is at Thanksgiving,
when dinners are sent to two hucdred
anrl fifty or three hundred families, rep
rf sertinrc eight or nine hundred people.
The dinre rs .are given to the worthy poor
of the city, to be prepared in their own
hr.rr.ep. ard there are good things to make
e--es b'g with worder, and appetites sat
isfied for\once. The people resort to
every possible means to be thought de
serving. A pale faced man will come
with a t;iby in arms, and four or five
at his b^e'.s. Applications come in sev
eral weeks early, but the greatest pre
cautlors are taken and a dinner is seldom
misplaced. ! Â«â¢ , .
Those who have never seen the mis
sion's Thanksgiving preparations have
m'ssecl a goodly sight. Through the
crurtesy of Mr. Reichart the basement
of Golden Gate Hall Is theirs for the day.
Girls', in huge aprons are everywhere,
each with a particular duty. . Express
men hurry in and out. There are turkeys'
and pics for a Teglment, and it seems as
though the world and his brother had
lovingly opened heart and purse on that
one long looked for, dreamed of day.
At this season, also, the mission's
store closet and funds are replenished.
Canned goods, dried fruits, meals, flour
and wine help tide over ,the year's de
mands. '
Contributions come from far and near,
many without' cards or, a suggestion of
the donor. One friend calling himself
"M. R.â M. F." sends $50 each year
through the Argonaut. "H. E. C." and
others as modest -have baffled the mis
sion's efforts to thank. them. If you be
lieve that the average young woman la
bored ard self absorbed, visit the mission
at Thanksgiving, and have your Illusions
dispelled. It is a long day of hard work, Â¦
and the enthusiasm isn't a thing of a day
or a week, either. Many of the members
have been active for years, and their
families have entered Into and shared
that enthusiasm.
The brother of a member visited one of
the mission's .most delightful cases with
her, and in her absence came himself to.
carry the basket. He was a boy, with a
boy's love of play, but somebody's suf
fering touched all the chivalry and fine
manhood in him. . Â¦.'
Some one said not long ago: "If young
women knew what infinite pleasure they
would get out of the work, they wouM
do it for selfish motives." Isn't it some
thing to be the only bit of. sunshine in a
poor, .worn out life? Doesn't it mean
more 'than the bickerings of a card
party? ,
There is a child 9 years old who never
has known' what childhood means. She
Js her dying father's nurse, housekeeper
for her mother, who earns the daily
bread, and caretaker of a sister who is
mute and simple. She seldom smiles.
There is so little to smile at. Girls who
play with dolls are "silly," she thinks.
The patient efforts of, a sunny natured
girl might give her back her childhood,
a little delayed, perhaps, but her child
hood nevertheless.
A. dainty personality and gentle Bug-*
gestlons have often made a woman take
pride In cleaning 1 out the corners a bit.
The result Is sometimes grotesque, but
the desire to be even a little cleaner is
worth the struggle to Implant It, Very
often there la little encouragement to go
on. The mission's work seems such a
drop in the great wells of misery, but
then conies a word of appreciation, rude
ly expressed, but straight from the heart,
The gladness of it is not soon forgotten,
So, wlth'no thought of reward, with no
expectation of getting, it bads in any
way, the mission workers give much of
themselves to the sick and the suffering,
and live their motto, "Bear ya ona
another's burdens."

fell dead. Â¦
Garner succeeded in getting possession
of the pistol, but while the struggle waa

its difficulties with the Packers' Company.

Went of the association. Now the packers ;
will be given the ultimatum of accepting i
the contract or the association will do its

The packing house proposed will be an

upon property leased from the town and
convenient to railroads. This move does
not meet the views of Director J. O.
Hayes, and it Is sail that he will tender
his resignation at the next meeting.

days that Dunn- was charged by Thomas
Lewis, a scavenger and owner of a fertil- I
izer, with having exacted tribute from all |
bills before he would "O K" them for
passage by tha Capitol Commissioners.
Lewis was asked for a statement, but
said that tha matter rested with higher
powers, and that while he could tell a j
etorv which wcuZd "set the town on fire"
>.e could not talk, as Dunn belonged to
the same society as himeelf.
The etory -which Has gained circulation
Is that Dunn required Lewis to hand him
over his percentage jjpon each claim, be
fore he would indorse it. and that Lewis
-when pressed told the whole story to Wil
liam Davis, secretary of the commission, â¢
and likewise executive .secretary to Gov
ernor Gage. Davis to-day denied knowl- \
edge of any such story, and declared i
there was nothing in It, but State Treas

Commissioners, said that the commission
Â¦would investigate the stories as soon.' as
Governor Gage returned to the city.
Dunn when wen this afternoon said he
had been informed that Lewis went to
Secretary Davia and told aim he had been
forced to pay tribute, but Dunn asserted
that the story was entirely false and that
lie never received a cent from Lewis.
It appears from an exanrination of the
bills on file in the State Controller's office
that Dunn indorsed bills f*r large sums
drawn by Lewis. Not counting scores of
bills for small sums. Lewis was allowed

SAN JOSE, July 6.â The political fight
that started between "Jim" Rea and
"Johnnie" Mackenzie over the appoint
ment of a County License Collector by the
Supervisors is spreading, and it is said
that the Mackenzie faction will come back
at the Realtes by attacking the county
license law. Mackenzie's candidate for
collector, Elmer Cottle, was turned down
and Rea, with the aid of Supervisor Roll,
a Democrat, elected J. D. Canelo. The
compensation of the office Is 5' per cent of
the amount collected. This should net the
License Collector from $1200 to $1500 a year.
The Mackenzie clique is bitter over the
treatment of Cottle and willing to do any
thlng- to get back at Rea. - They propose
to attack the county license law, wnich
provides for collecting city licenses, on
the ground that it is unconstitutional. It
is said a test case will be brought to re
strain the County License Collector from
collecting licenses from, the saloon-keepers
of this city. A firm of attorneys has been
consulted and It is said that a number of
saloon-keepers have agreed to contribute to
a fund. with which to make the fight. '
There are eighty-four In the
city, each of which contributes $120 a year
to thÂ© county treasury. In the various
towns of the county there are 124 saloons,
which turn into the treasury $14,880 yearly.
If the law were declared unconstitutional
it would cut the compensation of the col
lector to lesa than $600 a year, and make
the office practically worthless.

Santa Fe's Generosity.
STOCKTON, July 6.â The Santa Fe has
settled with Engineer W. J. Allen for his
injuries received in the accident at Point
Richmond several months ago, when a lo
comotive plunged through the wharf and
sank in the bay. It was reported to-day
that the Santa Fe had paid Mr. Allen
$12,000. but this Agent Lehmer denied
Mr. Lehmer. however." said that he was
not at liberty to state the exact amount
paid, but that both Engineer Allen and
the company were satisfied. Mr. Lehmer
said that the injured engineer could ob
tain a position with the Santa Fe if at any
time he were able to gro back to work.
The accident In which Allen was Injured
was the one in which Fireman Press
Adams lost his life.
Fleeces Many Residents.
SAN JOSE, July 6.â Harry Smith has
been "working" the small towns from
Santa Clara to Mountain View, and hav
ing fleeced all who are gullible, has gone
to parts unknown. He contracted store
bills, board bills and livery bills galore,
and now his creditors are looking in vain
for pay. One .of his last acts was to
hire a livery team at Mountain View and
take it to Santa Clara, pretending it was
his property. Of course the hungry cred
itors gobbled it at once and the Mountain
View owner of the property had to come
down, prove property and pav charges.
The officers are looking in vain"for Smith.

Â¦ra-r-y ERLIN, July 6.â Prince von Ho-'
= _2/ henlohe, formerly German Im
==^V perial Chancellor, died at Ra
>*,*/-* gatz, Switzerland, last evening.
Prince von Hohenlohe's death
was generally unexpected here, as he left
Berlin several weeks ago apparently in
good health, although his Increasing
weakness was evident. The Prince ar
rived at Ragatz extremely exhausted. . His.
death Is attributed to the weakness of old
age. The arrangements for the transpor
tation of the body to Germany ,and for
the obsequies are not yet definitely de
termined upon, but it is expected that tho
remains will be conveyed to the Hohen
lohe ancestral home at Schillingsfurst, Ba
tavla, where the family vault is situated
and where the- body of Prince von Hohen
lohe's wife is interred. It is also expected
that Chancellor von Bulow will break his
seaside rest and attend the funeral.
Although Emperor William has fixed his
departure on his trip to Norway for Mon
day next, it is deemed likely that his Maj
esty will once more postpone the date of
his starting in order to enable him to at
tend the obseaules. Owing to Emperor
William's relationship to Prince ' Hohen
lohe, his Majesty always called the Prtnce
"Uncle Chlodwig-."
It is not believed here that the body of
Prince von Hohenlohe will be brought to
Beriin before being taken to Schillings
furst.
Was, a True Friend of America.
The officials of the United States em
bassy informed the correspondent that
the death of the former Chancellor was
much regretted because of his uniform
kindliness toward Americans and Ameri
can interests. Prince von Hohenlohe's at
titude during his Chancellorship was al
ways fair and conciliatory in regard to
Ger.nan-American relations. Although he
was an extensive estate owner, he did not
share the Agrarian hostility toward the
United States. It was owing in a large
measure to his friendly spirit during sev
eral trying years that Germany's rela
tions with the United States never altered
from cordiality. He received many Amer
icans and was always friendlv to them.
At the time of the death of United States
Embassador Theodore B. Runyon, in 189fi,
which pecurred in the middle of the night,
Secretary Jackson went early in the morn
ing to inform the Cabinet Ministers of
Mr. Runyon's demise, but only found
Minister Hohenlohe ready to receive him.

The record of tin plate prices during- the
past two years shows a remarkable fluc
tuation, largely due to the unusually high
price of material in 1900. Quotations for
tin plate furnished to the Treasury Bu
reau of Statistics show the price per box
of 100 pounds of tin plate of Bessemer
steel in New York in April, 1901, as $4 20,
the uniform price since January 1, 1901; in
January. 1900. the price was $5 50, while in
January, 1898, it was $3 SO. Meantime the
price of Straits .tin used in the manufac
ture of tin plate has increased from 13.S2o
per pound in January, 1898, to 34.62c in
July. 1900, and thence downward to 26.2c on
April 19, 1901, and again advancing to 28.15c
on June 1. 1901. while steel billets increased
in price from $15 per ton in January, 1898,
to $35 per ton in January, 1900, since which
date the price has fluctuated considerably,
finally becoming practically stationary at
$28 per ton in March, 1901.
The figures of the Treasury Bureau of
Statistics show that the exoorts of tin
plate from the United States, which in the
ten months ending with April, 1899,
amounted to only 183,955 pounds, and in
the ten months ending- with April, 1900, to
275,990 pounds, were, In the ten months
ending with April, 1901, 1.306,100 pounds. In
imports of tin plate the figures for the ten
months show a material decrease as com
pared with the Quantity Imported during
the same period of the preceding fiscal
year, being 28,009,722 pounas, as compared
with 123.59S.773 pounds for the, ten months'
period of last year.
Our total exportations of tin Dlate in
the fiscal year 1901 seem likely to be from
eight to ten times those of 1599, while the
importations of tin plate into the United
States promise to be little more than one
tenth those of 1891, the year of the largest
importation of tin plate into the United
States, and but about one-fifth of the av
erage annual importation during the five
years prior to the establishment of the tin
plate industry in the United States.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, July 6.â American
manufacturers of tin plate are making
rapid gains in their attempt to enter the
foreign markets of the world. To be sure,
their exports are yet small as compared
with the domestic demand which they are
meeting', but they are again reducing the
imports, which temporarily increased in
1&00 under the.exoessive demand and ex
tremely high price of 'materials, and are
at the same time Increasing their exports
in a manner which proves interesting to
those who have watched the development
of this comparatively new industry in the
United States. . .

OMAHA, July 6.-The First Methodist
Church, a house of worship frequented
by ' fashionable society, will no longer
present a. gay appearance on Sunday
morning. The board of trustees has
passed a resolution forbidding women to
.wear hats during the hour of service, de
crying gorgeous headgear as an impedi
ment in the attainment of godliness. The
congregation is . presided ; over by Dr.
Hirst, formerly a well-known divine in
Chicago, and the audience room is
crowded at every service.
Dr. Hirst has inaugurated the reform
in order that those who come for wor
ship and with no eye to the adornment of
the outer man may be spared inconveni
ence. He points out that Omaha was
the first city to dispense with women's
hats in the theater and believes It ill be
comes the church Â¦ to tarry behind when
such an- advanced and commendable step
is going forward.
The formal resolutions passed by the
board recite at some length the evil
which results from competition In the
matter of raiment and conclude with the
following demand:
"The officiary of this church insist that
at all public services the women shall re
move their hats Immediately upon enter-
Ing the pews."
In thus giving the hairdresser the ad
vantage over the milliner the board be
lieves that rich and poor will be placed
on the same level.

After the alarm of fire had been sounded
the residents of Sausalito turned out in
large force to assist in staying the pro
gress of the flames. The marines from. the
revenue cutter McCulloch were landed,
and with chemical fire apparatus hurried
to the scene. Little could be done in sav
ing the dwelling, as the fire gained rapid
headway and soon flames had enveloped
the many tall turrets that made the struc
ture one of Â¦ the ;, beautiful marks of the
town. "Water, was scarce. I The fire light
ers were* forced to . depend on - a limited
supply obtained from; a tank and a well
situated a short distance from the con
flagration.
After a time the. work of preventing the
total destruction of the building was aban
doned and attention was given. to saving
the adjacent structures. Showers of sparks
shot heavenward and alighted on roofs in
the vicinity. Many incipient flrea were ex
tinguished before they caused much dam
age. The Wirthle stables were on fire sev
eral times, but by dint of hard work were
saved.
Mrs. Wirthle. who Is an invalid, was
carried from the house and suffered so se
verely Â¦: from shock that It became neces
sary to send her to San Francisoo for med
ical, attention. The other inmates of the
house, though they had retired, found time
to make their escape and save most of
their personal belongings. Most of the
costly furniture was , burned and con
tributed largely to the loss. : Â¦

shortly after 10 o'clock Friday evening.
The flames originated in the upper story
and in less than one hour from the time
of their discovery the structure had been
reduced to a heap of ashes and glowing
coals. The only water available was drawn
from a well and was utilized in saving the
stables and buildings adjacent to the burn-
Ing residence. The loss will be heavy and
will probably amount to $50,000.

Prince Von Hohenlohe was reluctant to
take up the reins, but .the Emperor
pressed- him to' continue his services to
the state which he had rendered as Em
bassador at the great courts of Europe,
and as statthalter of Alsace-Lorraine. He
continued to carry out his imperial mas
ter's policy till the advancing burden of
years made it evident that he -was un
able to cope with the obstructive tactics
pursued by . the Government's opponents
in the Reichstag and 'Prussian Parlia
ment and he retired last October in favor
of Count Von Bulow. His appointment to
the chief office in the German ; Empire
marked a complete fusion of the south
German states with Prussia. Born in 1819,
he was four years younger than Bis
marck. He was a second son, but by
virtue of a contract with his elder broth
er, the Duke of Ratibor, he succeeded in
1846 to the titles and honors of the head
of the family. Few houses can boast of
such ancestral dignities or such a long
descent even in Germany. The Hohen
lohes came into prominence as early as
the twelfth century and have retained
immense estates in various parts" of the
fatherland. By his marrriage with the
Princess Marie de Savn-Wlttgenstein
great possessions came to him In Russia,
but the law forbade foreigners to hold
real estate in the Czar's dominions and
these lands had to be given up.
Chlodwig Carl Victor von Hohenlohe-
Schilling-sfurst, Prince of Ratibor, be
come Chancellor of the German Empire.
That was in 1894, when General Von Cap
rlvl, who had found the chancellorship a
thorny > and unpleasant position in suc
cession to Bismarck, was glad to escape
from thej constant opposition he met with
from the Agrarian and other political
parties."
WASHINGTON, July 6.â The Presi
dent's proclamation opening to settlement
the newly ceded Indian lands in Okla
homa Territory will be made public in
the newspapers of 'Monday morning-.
There is a vast area of the lands, and
thousands of people have been waiting
upon the borders for months in order
to be among the first ' to enter.
The opening of the - new country will
necessitate â¢ the creation of two new land
districts and three new counties, and
they, have been established by proclama
tion of the President. ' The Land Office
for the first district is to be . located at
El Reno, In Oklahoma County, and the
second at the new town of Lawton, named
for the late general Lawton, and located
on the site of old Fort Sill. The lands
embraced In the Lawton district will be
wholly ' in the ceded country, but addi
tions will be made to the El Reno district
from both Â¦ the Oklahoma City and King
fisher districts. The new counties created
are named respectively Caddo, with Ana
darko as county seat; Comanche, with
I.awton as county seat, and Klowa, with
Hobart as county seat. A portion of the
new lands" is added to counties already
established.
The President has also issued a procla
mation designating the Wichita Moun
tains, In the heart of the old Kiowa res
ervation, as a forest reserve. The lands
thus reserved cover an area of 58,000 acres
and are covered with timber and under
growth. The proclamation and the papers
issued with them are prepared by Judge
Vandeventer, Assistant Attorney Gen
eral. â¢

The â¢ board of trustees assembled later
to decide upon the city for the next con
vention, which is to be held in 1903. A big
delegation presented the claims of St.
Louis, laying especial stress upon the ex
position rates which . will be In effect
there at that time, but as the trustees
expected to hear from other cities, nota
bly Denver, which is after the 1903 conven
tion, they left the matter in the hands of

decide, and no city will be chosen during
the present convention..

Wholesome Advice
For Peopls Whose Stomachs Are
Weak and Digestion Poop.
Dr. Harlandscn, whose opinion in dis-
eases is worthy of attention, says when a
man or woman comes to me complaining
of indigestion, loss of appetite, sour stom-
ach, belching, sour watery rising, head-
aches, sleeplessness, lack of ambition and
a general run down nervous condition I
advise them to- take after each meal one
or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, al-
lcwing the tablet to dissolve In the mouth,
and thus mingle with the food eaten. The
result is that the food is speedily digested
before it has time to sour and ferment.
These tablets will digest the food any-
way, whether the stomach wants to or
not, because they contain harmless di-
gestive principles, vegetable essences,
pepsin and Golden Seal, which supply
just what the weak stomach lacks.
I have advised the tablets with gTeat
success, both in curing Indigestion and to
build up the tissues, increasing flesh In
' thin, nervous patients, whose real trouble
was dyspepsia, and as soon as the stom-
sch was put to rig-hts they did not know
what sickness was.
A fifty cent package of Stuart's Dyspep-
ela Tablets can be bought at any drug
store, and as they. are not a secret patent
medicine, they can be used as often as
desired, with full assurance that they

Perfect Health
Is within the reach of almost every
woman. The weakness, nervousness
and irritability from which so many
women suffer is in general due to dis-
ease of the delicate womanly organism.
When the disease is cured the general
health is re-established.
Doctor Pierce's Favorite Prescription
makes weak women, strong and sick
women well. It promotes regularity,
dries disagreeable and enfeebling drains,
heals inflammation and ulceration and
cures female weakness. When these
diseases are cured, headache, backache,
nervousness and weakness are cured also.

suffering for seven long months, and had taken
medicine from a physician all the time, but it
seemed to make me feel much worse. My
stomach was so bad (so my doctor told me), and
my nerves were in such a state that I would
start at the least noise. I felt irritable at all

a deep underlying reverence for nature in
its most beautiful manifestations he
would spend his vacation in this locality.
He knew every stone and tree of the val

Professor Joseph N. Le Conte had lent
the luster of his great name to the Uni
versity of California and to the whole Pa
cific Coast for the last thirty-two years.
His fame was worldwide and all science
and letters everywhere claimed proprie
torship in him. '
The Father a Scientist.
The distinguished naturalist and philos
opher responded to a call from the nas
cent State University, â¢ then located in
Oakland, in 1868. at the age of, 46 years.
With him came his brother, John Le
Conte. the great physicist and chemist,
at- a later period president of the univer
sity. . . â¢ . ,
The Le Contes.wcre Georgians by. birth.
Their father, Louis LÂ© Conte, settled in
I4b'erty Countv in . 1810. He there mar
ried Anne Quaterman, a young lady of
Puritan descent; On the plantation In
Liberty r County four sons and " three
daughters were born to the couple. Jo
seph .was born Â¦ February 26, \1823. * His
mother died when he was but a boy, and
the father devoted himself to .the rearing
of .the family of children. Professor Le
Conte was wont to speak of. his father
with the most passionate affection. Loui3
Le. Conte,. though burdened with the con
duct of a large estate, was devoted, to an
aVpfcatlon much more '. congenial his
tasteâ rthat of tho study of natural
science, i He possessed on â¢ his plantation
the finest botanical garden- ln America
and had a chemical laboratory fitted up
ln his'hou8e. He Imbued his sons with
his own love of nature, and. to the trafn-
with 'tender 'regrets; many encouragements,
mingled with earnest entreaties to take care of
myself, and to keep out of draughts and 'damp
while sleeping on the bare ground in the open
air; many half suppressed tears, concealed be
neath bright smiles. I left my home and dear
ones this morning. Surely I must have a heroic
and dangerous air about me, for my little baby
boy shrinks from my rough flannel shirt and
broad-brimmed- hat, - as did the baby son of
Hector from his brazen corslet, and beamy
helm and nodding plume. I snatch a kiss and
hurry away to our place of rendezvous.
3. Myself â long and lean and lantern-jawed,
and in search of romantic adventure, I was
sometimes called, by Llndennan, but very sec
retly. Don Quixote. I accept the nickname with
pleasure perhaps with pride. I have a great
respect for the old Don. There was nothing re
markable about my- horse. 'A strong, tough,
well-made gray, both gentle and careful, he
was admirably suited for my purposes. My
function ln the party was that of surgeon and
scientific lecturer.
This is the description ' given by the
writer of the- big trees In the Mariposa
grove at Wawona, then known as Clarks
Big Tree Station: . i
My first Impression of the big trees was
somewhat disappointing, but, as I passed from
one to another; as. with upturned face I
looked along; their straight polished shafts,
towering to the height of 300 feet; as I climbed
up the Bides of the prostrate trunks and
stepped from end to end, as I rode around the
standing trees and into their enormous hollows;
as we rode through the hollows of some of
these prostrate trunks, and even chased one
another on horseback through these enormous,
hollow cylinders, a sense of their Immensity
grew upon me. If they stood by themselves
on a plain, they would be more Immediately
striking. But they are giants among giants.
ThÂ« whole forest Is filled with magnificent
treeo, sugar pines,- yellow pines and spruce,
eight to ten feet ln diameter and 200 to 250 feet
high. The sugar pine, especially, Is a magnifi
cent tree in size, height and symmetry of form.
Of all the big trees of this grove, and, there
fore of all the trees I hava ever seen, the
Grizzly Giant Impressed me most profoundly;
not, indeed, by its tallness or Its symmetry,
but by the hugeness of Its cylindrical trunk,
and by a certain gnarled grandeur, a fibrous,
sinewy strength which seems to defy time it
self. The others; with â¢ their smooth, straight
tapering shafts, towering to the height of 300
feet, seemed to me a type of youthful vigor
and beauty, in the plenitude of power and
success. But this, with its large, rough
knobbed, battered trunk, more than thirty feet
in diameter â with top broken off and decayed
at the height of 150 feetâ with Its great limbs,
six to eight feet ln diameter, twisted and
brokenâ seemed to me the type of a great life,
decaying, but still strong and self-reliant. Per
haps .my own bald head and grizzled locksâ
my.. own top. with its decaying . foliage â made
me sympathize with this grizzled giant; but I
found the Captain (Professor Frank Boule), too,
standing with cap in hand, and gazing ln
silent, bareheaded reverence upon the grand
old tree. t
Here is the 'description written by Pro
fessor Le Conte of his first view of the
Yosemlte Valley, in which he was to die
thirty-one years later:
. With increasing enthusiasm we pushed on
until, about 6 p. m., we reached and climbed
Sentinel Dome. This point is four thousand
five hundred feet above the Yosemlte Valley
and eight thousand five hundred feet above
the sea. The- view which here burst upon
us of the valley and the Sierras it is simply
impossible to describe. Sentinel Dome stands
on the south margin of Yosemite, near the
point where it branches Into three canyons.
To the left stands El Capltan's massive, per
pendicular wall; directly In front, and dis
tant about one mile. Yosemlte Palls, like a
gauzy veil, rippling and waving with a slow,
mazy motion; to the right the- mighty granite
mass of Half Dome lifts Itself in solitary
grandeur, defying the efforts of the climber;
to. the extreme right, and a little behind.
Nevada Falls, with the Cap of Liberty: in the
distance. Innumerable peaks of the high Sier
ras, conspicuous among which are Clouds
Rest. Mount Starr King. Cathedral Peak. etc.
We Â¦ remained on the top of this dome more
than an hour, to see the sunset. Â¦ We were
well repaidâ such a sunset I never saw: such
a sunset, combined with such a view. I have
never Imagined. The gorpeous golden and
crimson in the west, and tiie exquisitely deli
cate, diffused rosebloom tinging the cloud
caps of tho Sierras ln the east, and the
shadows of the grand peaks and domes slow
ly creeping ud the valley! I can never for
get the Impression. "We remained, enjoying
this scene, too long to think of going to Gla
cier Point this evening. We therefore put this
off until morning and returned on our trail
about one and a half miles to a beautiful
green meadow (Hawkins had chosen it on his
way to Sentinel Dome) and there made camp
in a grove of magnificent ipruce trees.

SUXDAT. July 31.
I got up at peep of day this morning (I am
dlshwash to-day), roused the party, started the
fire and in ten minutes tea was ready. All
partook heartily of this delicious beverage and
started on foot to see the sun rise from Glacier
Point. This point Is about one and a half miles
from our camp, about 3200 feet above the valley
and forms the salient angle on the south side.
Just where the valley divides into three. We
had to descend about 800 feet to reach it. W"Â»
arrived just before sunrise. Sunrise from Gla
cier Point I No one can appreciate It who has
not seen it. It "was our good fortune to hava
an exceedingly beautiful sunrise. Rosy-fin
gered Aurora revealed herself to us, her vo
taries, morÂ© bright and charming and rosy than
ever before. But the great charm was the
view of the valley and surrounding peaks in
the fresh, cool morning hours and in the rosy
light of the rising win; the bright, warm light
on the mountain tops and the cool shade in
the valley. The shadow of the grand Half
Dome stretches clear across the valley, while
Its own "bald, awful head" glitters ln the
early sunlight. To the right Vernal and NÂ«Â«
vada falls, with their magnificent overhanging
peaks In full view; while directly across see
the ever-rippling, ever-swaying, gauzy veil of
the Yosemlte Fall, reaching from top to bot
tom of the opposite cliff, two thousand six hun
dred feet.
Below, at a depth of S200 feet, the bottom of
the valley lies like a garden. ThÂ«rÂ«. rlerht under
our noses are the hotels, the orchards, the fields,
the meadows (near one of these, Hawkins, even
now, select* our future camp)â the forest and
through all the Merced River winds its appar
ently lazy serpentine way. Yonder^ up the
Tenaya Canyon, nestling close under the
shadows of Half Dome, lies Mirror Lake, fast
asleep, her polished black surface, not yet rip
pled by the rising wind. I have heard and read
much of this wonderful valley, but I can truly
say. I had never Imagined the grandeur of the
reality.

â¢ About a week before the end of tne first ses
sion of tha University of California several
young men, students of the university. Invited
me to join them in a camping party for the
Yosemlte and the high Sierras. The party was
to go in- regular pioneer style, cooking their
own provisions and sleeping under the open
sky whenever a convenient place was found;
each man was to bestride his own horse, carry
his own bedding behind his saddle, and his
clothing, with exception of one change of un
derwear, on his back. Tills was, it la true, a
little rougher and harder than anything I had
ever undertaken, but still I was fond of ad
venture and longed * to enjoy the glories of
Yosemlte and the beauties of tho Sierras, and,
more than all, to study mountain structure and
mountain sculpture as exhibited there . on a
magnificent scale. I therefore at once accepted
the offer. The party was forthwith organized,
ten in number. , Mr. Hawkins, who understood
something 'of mountain life, was commissioned
to buy the necessary supplies I and the general
outfit, such as camp utensils, pack horses and
pack saddles, and have all in readiness that
we might start the very first day after com
mencement. ... . . ;
After his return from his first trip Into
the Yosemite Valley Professor Le Conte
wrote up his journal- and it was printed
for private distribution in 1875, five years
after the party went into the valley.. This
book contains many little bits that show
the character of the great scholar and
supplies some description of the very
place where he died that will have partic
ular interest under the circumstances.
This work contains his^flrst impressions
of the place he last gazed upon. >
This is the preface to the work, de
scribing how the party started: â¢
OAKLAND, July, 6.â Professor Joseph
Le Conte made his first trip to the . Yo
semite Valley in 1S70. He became an en
thusiast upon that wonderland, and it
seems almost fate that he should have
met his death in a place that he loved so
well. Despite his great age Professor Le
Conte always took all of the trails and
made, trips that younger, men would not

face"; "On Some of the Ancient Glaciers of

It was as a lecturer in the crowded
Berkeley classroom, however, that Pro
fessor Le Conte made his greatest repu
tation. His was the learning of the sa
vant with the. diction of the poet.
His Varied Work.
Since his coming to the University of
California Dr. Le Conte had held the post
of professor of geology and natural nis
tory, a chair which embraced zoology
and oven botany. In the last few years
he had given -way to specialists in the
several departments, Professor Lawson as
suming the work In geology. Professor
Ritter in zoology â¢ and Professor Setcnell
.in botany. .-.V^3j^*-.:-v4Â£'"..-; â¢ A . .
Professor L*e Conte's; work hau branched
inta other lines." He was a literary man,
a Shakespearean scholar .and a philoso
pher. Professor Howison of the chair in
philosophy once said: "However well
known Dr. Le Conte will be in future as
a scientist, he will be even better known
as a philosopher."
He took an able part several years ago
ln the famous discussion .before the
Berkeley Philosophical Union. . Professor
Josiah Royce of Harvard led the debate
and Professors Howison, Mezes and Le
Conte followed in a brilliant discussion.
In 1891 and 1S92 he took a leave of ab
sence from the university and attended
conventions in the East and ln Europe.
He was elected president of the American
Society for the Advancement of Science
and one of the vice presidents of the In
ternational Geological Conference.
He went on a second trip in 1S99 and
visited many European friends, attending
conventions and conferences in England
and France.
His Pacific Coast connections were nu
merous, - including Important positions in
the California Academy of Sciences and
the Geological Society of America.
Dr. Le Conte's work recently had .been
more in philosophical linesâ in general
izing geology. His last contribution of
Importance to geological science was a
paper prepared for the Geological Society
of America, in which he > recognized the
Sierran epoch in the Quaternary, naming
that long prc-glacial period In that age.
His recent college work consisted in giv
ing 'special courses along lines in which
he was most interested. After giving up
his heavy lecture work in geology . and
zoology some six years ago, he devoted
himself to lecturing on evolution, binocu
lar vision, genesis of ore deposits, theo
ries of Jiountain building and quaternary
geology.
His last public appearances were on
March 23, the university charter day,
when he spoke at the presentation of Re
gent Hallidie's picture, and last May in
commencement week, when he was chosen
to give the annual oration before the Phi
Beta Kappa society.
To the affectionate students at Berke
ley he has been knbwn for thirty years
as "Professor Joe." His charming per
sonality and infectious enthusiasm for
his high calling endeared him to all who
were privileged to come within the sphere
of his influence. ; , ,
Dr. Le Cdtite was a singularly fruitful
and fascinating thinker along lines of
speculative and popular philosophy, no
less than in the technique of his own spe
cialties. He was the author of several
volumes, which remain classics ln the
universities of both hemispheres. _'
He published his textbook on the Ele
ments of Geology" in 1S78. "The Mutual
Relations of Religion and Science, a
monograph which spread his fame
throughout the civilized world. ap
peared two years earlier.
"Sight" was issued in 1S81 and "A Com
pend of Geology" in 18S4. Other works
of his which appeared from time to time
are the following:
Known as "Professor Joe."
Dr. Le Conte's place in scholarship and
letters is unique. For profundity of re
search, coupled with luminous power or
exposition, he was without a peer in the
University of- California and Â¦ had few
equals in the history of thought. Learned
societies of all nationalities heaped hon
ors upon him and he was sought as a lec
turer at the greatest European centers of
education when abroad.
. In 1851 the professor was drawn by the
great name of Agassiz to visit Harvard
College, and once within the spell of that
famous teacher he abandoned all further
thought of life as a practitioner and de
voted-himself to the stuGy of natural his
tory. Later in the same year he accepted
a call to the chair of natural science In
Oglethorpe University, and in 1852 be
came professor of geology and> natural
history in his alma mater, where he lec
tured with increasing renown until 1S5*?,
when he was called to the headship of the
same department in the South Carolina
College at Columbia an institution whose
strong literary atmosphere possessed a
great attraction for him. -
At the outbreak of the civil war the
college was disbanded. ' Â¦ ,
Dr. Le Conte entered the service of the
Confederate Government . as chemical ex
pert, retaining that position till the close
of the war.
In 1866 he assisted in reorganixing the
college at Columbia, remaining there two
years till the call from California opened
the way to the position which he has over
since filled with such eminent success.

At 3 p. m.â "Went again alona to the lower

directly through the gate and up the valley.
There, again, rlslnjr to the very sklas, stands
the huge inass of Â£3 Cjipltan on tha one stda

PROFESSOR JOSEPH LE CONTE
DIES IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY
"He loved all young people," said Da
vidson, "and he delighted to be In their
company and to be able to â¢ help them.
Many a time he has told me how some
great big fellow, whose name and even
face he had forgotten, had stopped "him
and, recalling to his memory who he was,
had told him of his life and his ambi
tions and bis alms, 'just as though I were
There was something Infinitely tender
and touching in the way Davidson spoke
of his old friend. He had countless anec
dotes to tell of the dead man's full and
useful life, and they were all anecdotes
that proved his universal kindness and
chivalrous nature. . . _ .
"His life was pure; his ideas were pure.
He was thoroughly religious, and while
believing in evolution he tried to reconcile
scientific evolution with the doctrines of
the Bible." -
"He was a model for young men." con
tinued Professor Davidson. "He had only
one fallingâ he never wanted to say 'no.*
He was never known to say evil of any
man. He was always kind, and no matter
how much evil was reported of a man, he
would still believe there must be some
good streak in him.
"He was a supreme man. made to Im
part knowledge. As Agassiz said 'I am a
teacher,* so may it be said of Le Conte,
â¢He was made to impart knowledge, not
only to the young, but to the old as
Â¦well.* " That is the tribute Davidson paid
to his old friend last evening. In these
few words the scientist summed up his
regard and admiration for his old friend.
California, and that office brought the in
terests of the iwo teachers in close con
tact. Then in '98 Davidson was offered
and accepted the chair of geography in
the University of California, and so closer
still became i'ie friendship of the two
prreat old men, who were thereby thrown
constantly together.

The announcement that the policy of the
management will be favorable to the
American play is already turning the at

Rumors ana proclamations as to the dra
matic season of 1901-1S02 are of frequent occur
rence. The most auspicious announcement Is
that of the opening of Mrs. Flske's theater,
the Manhattan, in September. Mrs. Fiske Is
a woman of fine Intellectual character and an
actress of great ability, and she will main
tain a theater Independent ot all cliques and
free from the blight of sordid speculation. Her
ambition has shown Itself to be noble: her rec
ord is stainless; her experience is ample, and
she is In the prime of life and hope and suc
crsÂ«ful achievement. "With her advent as a
New Tork manager the void left by Augustin
Daly seems likely to be filled, in which case
the New York public can again have access
to at least one theater that Is exclusively and
rigorously devoted to good plays and good act

PROBABLY as hopeful news for the
future of dramatic art in America
as may be heard on a summer's

of the Manhattan Theater, New
York, by Mrs. Fiske. Hear William TV in
ter on the subject in the New York
Tribune:
- But the playwright went manfully to
work, suggested with real genius his cen
tral, figure, left out the women of the
drama, and gathered up Into genuinely
dramatic sequence the salient incidents of
the story- He wrote a dignified and pic
turesque dialogue, and when, the play was
finished spent two months In drilling tho
students in their parts, with an ultimate
success that has persuaded Joseph Gris
mer (the New York theatrical manager
who came across the continent to see the
play) to put "Nazareth" on the stage in
this Bast. Mr. Grismer will be associated
with William A. Brady In the production,
and a theater has already been engaged.
It is expected that "Nazareth" will be
produced some time during the fall, prob
ably not quite In Its origlnaf form, as Mr.
Greene intimated to me his intention of
adding the principal female figures of the
drama to his play. Meantime "Nazareth."
written by a Californian playwright, . for
the jubilee fete of his alma mater, is one
of the features of the hour.
Again, the student material, from which
the cast of Mr. Greene's play was neces
sarily to be drawn, though bright and
reverent, was not exactly that from which
stars are made; and the college stage,
though amazingly well equipped' In some
regards, yet In others lacks considerably.
So much for the conditions.
The other way. that of personifying the
Christ, has been tried with indifferent
success In America, only in the weird and
barbarous attempts of the Indians at
physical representation of their Christ
Ideal. J Salmi B. Morse died broken-heart
ed of his attempt to stage the sacred
drama, and altogether the outlook was
not encouraging:.
In some cases the inconvenient petticoat
is simply dropped from the cast, with
mere or less picturesque result. Then in
those plays otherwise deemed desirable
for college presentation, in which the fe
male characters stubbornly refuse to be
done to a literate death, they are re
sexed, given hose and doublet, and bidden
to strut the stage in all the new-found
glory of their masculine habiliments.
Thus Portia, in "The Merchant of Ven
ice," becomes Peter (or Paul; no, I re
member now, Bellarlo) and analogous
changes in all such plays are made. This
is all. by the way, except in so, far as it
explains one chief difficulty that confront
ed Mr. Greene in the writing of his Pas
sion Play. .

The second lion in the path was appar
ently even more difficult of mastery, the
question of the representation of the
Christ figure; but the playwright had
dreamed for twenty years of a certain
possibility, now made actual, by which
this could be overcome. It was, to sug
gest the Christ by the action of the other
figures In the sacred drama, to intimate
the divine presence by the reflected im
pulse of his personalityâ a sufficiently
high and poetic conception. So it was
done in pre-Oberammergau days, com
manded- thus by some reigning German
Prince, to whom the spectacle of a Judas
remorsefully disemboweling himself of a
string of frankfurters In one of the Pas
sion Plays presented itself as lacking in

have had to get along as best they might
without the employment of feminine tal
ent In their representation. The difficulty
is a familiar one to the play promoter In
both classes of private schools, but is
usually obviated by the male assumption
of feminine characters and vice versa.
Here, however, the students have never
assumed female roles, an arrangement
that would seem to be utterly prohibitive
of any extended repertoire but for a truly
ingenious if doubtfully artistic expedient.

It is surprising the people of the' East have not long since broken away from the conven
tion that required them to wear a coat during the heat of their sweltering summers. The hew move
ment is not a fad, but strictly one of common sense. We do not need shirt waists in San Fran
cisco, but none the less we can sympathize with our friends in the East. Indeed in reading the
reports, of the heat and humidity which have made it impossible for men to work or sleep, the
only wonder has been that some of them did;not feel inclined, like Sydney Smith, "to take off
their flesh and sit down in their bones."

In Omaha the pastors of all the churches held a conference on the subject and indorsed
the innovation. One of them is reported to have said "anything that is good enough to wear
upon the street is good enough to wear at church." Another said: "Clothes do not make re
ligion. I favor comfort." Thus there has been something like an official invitation to the men of
Omaha to wear shirt waists at church, and that garment is now looked upon as an irreproachable
dress for all occasions.
A report from St. Louis states that the pastor of one of the largest churches in the city
announced two weeks ago that he would adopt the new substitute for the coat, and advised the
men of his congregation to follow his example. The report goes on to say that upon the follow
ing Sunday "anumber of young men congregated in their shirt-sleeves. They appeared so cool
and comfortable that in the evening the greater part of the men in the congregation followed the
example; and a number of women with their hair dressed in attractive modes sat with their hats
in their laps,' and several came bareheaded."

OUT of the prolonged hot spell that has prevailed, over the entire East from the Rocky
' Mountains to the Atlantic coast there has come. something like a wholesale use of the
shirt waist among men. The garment is worn not only at business, but at social
functions in the afternoon, and even at church.
A BOOM FOR THE SHIRT WAIST.
In June of each year an annual statement
will be* mailed by the board of trustees to each
contributor, showing actual condition of fund
and number of students benefited.
Students desiring loans from this fund shall
make application at least ten days In advance,
to enable trustees to investigate each particu

Each loan shall be secured by a. note payable
on or before two years from date, shall bear
Interest at 4 per cent per annum and shall bÂ»
Indorsed to the satisfaction of the trustees.
Before a student Is entitled to a loan from
the fund he must have an application signed
by the Columbia School faculty, guaranteeing
his work in the school (of at least one term's
duration) and indorsing his worthiness: ha
must have indications of ability and determina

An Interval of at least thirty days shall
elapse between the successive loans, and no
single loan shall exceed $30.
The total amount loaned to one student shall
not exceed $300.
All funds shall be placed In a. reliable bank
by the treasurer, to be drawn upon as oc
casion requires: a reserve fund (of not less
than $100) at all times to be retained in tha
bank to meet any withdrawals of depositors.
After one year, if it Is tha wish of any de
positor to withdraw hla contribution to tho
fund, he may do so at any time thereafter
upon thirty days* notice to the trustees.
The fund is to be cared for by three trus

DIRECTOR OF THE ORCHES
TRA AT THE TIVOLI. WHO
HAS A SPLENDID RECORD.
POSTMASTER GENERAL SMITH has set the pace for the Republican party, in all
issues, everywhere., between the corrupt minority, running the machine,' controlling the
push and usurping the organization for private and personal gain, in opposition to public
interests. The machine in Pennsylvania has its seat of power in Philadelphia. Therefrom
it controls the Legislature and the State. It made a long fight to re-elect Senator Quay and suc
ceeded by securing the aid of the Democratic machine. Then it celebrated its victory by passing
the "Ripper bills," which deprived of self-government the anti-Quay cities. Their system of local
municipal government was legislated away from them and they were put under the rule of offi
cers appointed directly by the Governor, who is a member of the Quay machine.
Philadelphia retained her municipal government because it belonged to the machine. That
government has recently outraged the people by granting blanket franchises to favorites of the
two' Senators, refusing to accept for them millions of dollars that were bid, bona fide, by John
Wanamaker and others able to respond. upon their offered contract of purchase.
The machine programme there^ has been to rob all cities that Quay controls, and deprive
all others of self-government and rob them* also.
Philadelphia has protested. Independent Republicans there have nominated a ticket in op
position to the Quay machine, and it has been indorsed by a great meeting. To that meeting
Postmaster General Smith addressed a letter declaring his support of and sympathy with the anti
machine movement, -and scoring the" gang with a .pen trained to plain statement of plain truths.
If the Quay people were persons of ordinary sensibility they would wince under Postmaster, Gen
eral Smith's knout and bastinado; but they have neither ordinary nor any other kind of sensi
bility, and are impervious to anything, except defeat at the polls. Like the daughters of the
horse leech, they suck and cry, "More!" The only thing that impresses them is cutting their
sucker, by depriving them of office.
Postmaster General Smith's action is the sign given by the administration that Republi
cans must array themselves on the side of decency, decorum and common honesty.
The issue made in Pennsylvania is an issue made elsewhere, wherever the party organiza
tion is in the hands of the party machine, and its power is used to give high office to low men. It
has been made in Calif omiaY:.; Here the gauntlet was thrown down and decency was challenged
by indecency and dishone|fcy&'-It is easily remembered that the challenge was accepted, the issue
joined and the battle fotlght|out. When that emergency came The Call took the same position
now taken by Postmaster General Smith, and led a fight that was finished as we hope his will be.
To his attitude now we invite the attention of California Republicans. The State can be held
only by a party that comes with clean hands. The Republican party rose above the gutter, defied
the push, smote the machine and at the last election carried the State by 40,000 majority. But
even that majestic lead can be lost by wallowing in the gutter with the push.
In all issues of the kind with which we dealt before, The Call will stand on the side occu
pied by Postmaster General Smith and the administration. Where he leads for cleanness and de
cency this paper will follow, and where we lead in the same high cause we confidently expect
that he will follow.-
The Republican party is' the trustee of popular prosperity. It is in peril because of the
weakness and inconsequence of the party opposed to it. When two armies are equal in strength,
they must be officered by the best men. But an army that has no opposition may be led by camp
followers. Let the Republican party be put upon its caution. Nothing in its splendid- record
"made in peace and war under President McKinley can save it from defeat, if its camp followers
displace its generals. . .
This is the lesson taught by current events in Pennsylvania, and it must be heeded every-
A REPUBLICAN KEYNOTE.
Altogether the. Tivoli grand opera sea
son promises more favorably than any
season of its history, and no small share
of its success will be due to the man with
the baton. Mr. Paul Steindorff. After the
opera season la over, possibly before, -we
may hear from the Tivoli conductor in
quite another line of work, for he is a
person of appalling energy; but there Is
tlnie enough . to speak of that. For the
present ha is sufficiently occupied In drill
ing his chorus in the grand opera reper
toire at the rate of two operas a week,
orchestrating "Tannhauser" or "Lohen
grin" with sixteen instead of sixty parts
so that you won't Â¦ know the difference,'
getting acquainted with the Collamarlni,
Agostini and the rest of their idiosyncra
sies, and in his leisure drilling a chorus
of 150 voices that will be one of the fea
tures Â¦ at the German festival . on â¢ August
11, when the Goethe-Schiller monument
is unveiled' in the park.
Requiescat in pace!
Â¦Until all education is the concern of the
state, Us art, music and drama, as well
Collamarlni will sing the Delilah part in
Saint-Saens' "Samson and Delilah," and
it will be interesting to hear the dashing
Carmen as the olden time Hebrew siren.
Samson will be sung, by Agostini, who will
probably also assume the part made so
famous by Giannini in "II Guarany." I
believe this will be the first hearing here
of this opera also. "Falstaff" is another
novelty long-promised, and that fine ar
tist Salassa will be heard in the name
part. . The singer's Falstaff Is said to be
a conception equaling his lago in Verdi's
"Otello," though to me the broad humor
of the part seems somewhat foreign to
Salissa's make-up. Boito's "Mefistofele"
is now being revived in many opera
houses and will be fn eagerly looked for
novelty here. The opera is as different as
it is possible to imagine with an opera
telling the same story, from the "Faust"
of Gounod. The libretto is largely drawn
from Goethe's "Faust," and Is all through
cf unusual literary Boito's fine
gifts as librettist being here exhibited In
their fullness. The music also is of ex
ceptional beauty and Interest, and the ac
companying scenery of the opera of rarest
imaginative scope. The prologue is set
in heaven amidst clouds, the sounding
of the seven trumpets and the singing of
Invisible celestial phalanxes that are hid
den among the clouds. Meflstofele, a soli
tary figure, appears in the foreground,
making his wager with the heavenly pow
ers for the soul of Faust. After him come
a mystic chorus, penitents, cherubs,
leaving him at the close of the scene in
the shadows. The fourth act, too. Faust's
living vision of the "classical Sabbath,"
has a lovely scenic setting, not wholly
unlike that of the Venusberg in "Tann
hauser."
And of the man at the helm, Paul
Steindorff. Of themany good things that
the Tivoli has done for' music in San
Francisco none has probably been of more
value than the importation of the pres
ent conductor of its orchestra. Mr. Stein
dorff is a thoroughly cultured musician, a
pianist of eminence and of a long and hon
orable experience as conductor both with
Maurice Grau (for Lillian Russell) and
"Smiling Jimmy" Morrissey, the long
time manager of Emma Abbott. This by
no means is the measure of hla activity
as conductor, Bremen, Konigsberg and
other German cities having been lnclud-"
ed in his itinerary. Neither has the oper
atic stage entirely engrossed Mr. Stein
dorff's attention. He has conducted sym
phony orchestras in New York Â»nd Phila
delphia and spent a season as conductor
of the Society of Musical Art at the Wal
dorf-Astoriaâthe latter an honor much
coveted among musicians.
THE Tivoli Is beginning to look and
sound quite grrand opera-like these
days; with strains from "Aida"
and "Carmen" floating through the
air, new scores galore . littering
desk and shelf, and a garnish of Mme.
Collamarini's new purple and gold hose
and doublet that will later make their
debut in "Falstaff."
Among the scores I note with pleasure
those of '-'Samson and Delilah." the Boito
"Meflstofele," Giordano's "Andrea Che
nier," and a new-old Brazilian opera by
A. Carlos Gomez, "II Guarany." The
playgoer of an older time than mine will
well remember when "II Guarany" was
first given here. The company present
ing it came upon us unknown, unheralded,
unsyndicated, a little company of gifted
Italians who were journeying to Italy
after a South American tour that had
put some money in their purses. That was
sixteen or seventeen years ago, and the
company that of the Glannini brothers,
one of them the famous tenor who short
ly afterward returned as a star with
Patti. On the first night of their ap
pearance (at the old California Theater)
perhaps 200 people witnessed the perform
ance. The second night the house could
not hold the crowd, curious to hear the
company that the critics had been rav
ing over in the morning papers. Then
"II Guarany" ran to the limit of its en
gagement at the California, and after
ward went over to the Grand Opera
house, there playing for some weeks. Not
since then, I believe, has the opera been
heard here, and it is. of course, a ques
tion whether it will" appeal as strongly
to the public of to-day as to that of the
dear, dead yesterdays. It will at any rate
have all the grace of novelty. ;..'Â¦'
His loss- of course will be severely felt at the university, but fortunately the influence of
such men never wholly passes away. It has been said; "By this shall they be known who have
worked righteously â their works shall live after them." Neither the work, nor even the personal
influence of Joseph Le Conte will perish altogether from the State or from the university. Thou
sands of his former students as they read to-day of his death will feel in their hearts the thrilling
and throbbing of certain fine, sweet impulses that were started into life by'him and which survive
to continue his work now that he himself is gone."
Over and above all his scientific attainments Joseph Le Conte had another claim and hold
upon the esteem of Californians. It is an old saying that every man is greater than his work,
that there is something in each personality that can never be wrought out 'in any deed or
, uttere,d through any song. In Professor. Le Conte^that truth was strikingly illustrated. His per
sonal influence was felt not only by the students in his classes and by all who knew him, but
throughout the wider circle of those who only indirectly came into something of relation and
association with him.
The vital principle of his life was that of absolute unselfishness. Through his fine nature
and high genius that trait showed itself in every direction. In his work he sought not money nor
'fame, but truth. In all his dealings with men he* sought not personal advantage, but the good
of others. His courtesy was a charm felt/by all who came into his presence. So gracious was he
that at every period of his life there was felt for him a respect mingled with love, and in later
years he was looked up to with a genuine veneration.
FROM the University of California there has graduated and gone, forth forever Joseph Le
Conte, one of the most earnest of scientists, truest of teachers and best loved of men,. The
place he so long occupied, not in the university only "but in the State, was so high
and so unique it is not likely there will ever live another, to attain it. He was one of the few
Californians whose fame as a student and master of science was as wide as the civilized world,
and in his work every intelligent Californian.felt a pride because it stood forth as proof that our
young commonwealth was not given over wholly to mere material good, but had among her
-people those who loved intellectual truth and beauty and counted knowledge more precious
than gold. -' \

fatally shot by a crazy man named Henry
Wlimbusy at Rathdrum, Idaho, last night.
Brady was seated In the probate office
when Wilmbusy entered and fired at close
range, the ball entering below the right
eye and fracturing the base" of the brain
The murderer turned out the lights and
escaped. '
Wlimbusy was adjudged insane four
years ago by Judge. Brady. This preyed
on his mind. He escaped several times
and was recommitted, but the last time
was allowed to remain at large.

PITTSBURGH July 6.â The strike of the
American Sheet Steel Company and
American Steel Hoop Company mill em
ployes will probably be terminated next
â¢week. Arrangements were made in. this
city to-day for the holding of a joint con
ference in Pittsburg between representa
tives of both companies, which are mem
bers of the United States Steel Corpora
tion, and representatives of the Amalga
mated Steel, Iron and Tin Workers for ad
justing the existing labor troubles. The
agreement to meet in conference means
virtually a settlement of the strike, inas
much as the operating officials of the hoop
and sheet companies would not have con
sented to meet the workers' committee un
less there was good prospect of immediate
settlement, and it may be accepted as a
settled fact that all the mills now idle
will be In operation by the last of next
week, and that the strike, which tnreat
ened the steel industry generally, will be
averted in its incipiency. It is stated on
good authority that the conference will be
held early next Â¦week, probably before
Wednesday, and assurance is given that a
settlement of the trouble will be speedily
effected. The operating officials of the
steel companies will meet the workers'
committee, and as the question involved
Is not one of wages, but the extension of
organization control to so-called non
union plants, an agreement is likely to be
readily made. ...

INHERITS THE WEALTH
. OF LATE ALFRED FULLER
Judge Davis Recognizes William
Fuller as the Son of the Chico
Capitalist.
MARY SVILLE. July 6.â Judge Davis,
sitting in the Superior Court of this coun
ty, handed down an opinion this afternoon
for the contestant in the estate of Alfred
Fuller, deceased, transferred from Butte
County for trial. . Suit was brought by
William Fuller,- the son of Alfred Fuller,
and an Indian woman named Jenita. with
whom fuller lived! from 1S70 to 1875 at\the
toll gate near Sonbra, in Tuolumne Coun
ty. Fuller later lived in Chico, where he
died two years ago, leaving an estate of
$30,000. Â¦ - â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦-, . Â¦Â¦
Much criminal - and civil litigation fol
lowed Fuller's death. Dr. Rodley of Chico
is now serving a term" of ten years in San
Quentin for having forged a will which
he produced as the last will of Jthe dead
man, naming Mrs. Minnie Houseworth of
Chico as the principal legatee, and him
self and John Garner of Chico signing the
alleged will as witnesses. Garner con
fessed and Rodley's arrest and conviction
followed. Mrs. Houseworth' and Garner
are now in jail in Oroville awaiting trial
at the fall term of court.
The important findings of the court are
that the claimant j is the son of Alfred
Fuller and that he had been held up to
the world and received Into the family of
the deceased as such. The defendants
will appeal to the Supreme Court. .

BAKERSFIF.ID, July 6.â The investiga
tion of the Kern County course ot study
has resulted' in Superintendent of Public
Instruction T. J. Kirk ordering grade by
grade the reinstatement of the textbooks
provided by the State and insisting that
the long list of other books in the manual
as adopted by the Kern County. Board of
"Education be properly designated as sup
plemental to the lawful series. The bofird
was instructed to have the manual pla
carded with slips in accordance with the
changes required by Superintendent Kirk
and a certified copy sent him to Sacra
mento.
Superintendent Doub Insisted that there
was no intention on the part of the board
to violate the law, and agreed to conform
to the request cf Mr. Kirk. The investi
gation was proceeding without feeling on
either side when Attorney- S. C. Smith,
who represented Mr. Doub, arose and said
that he considered the investigation on
the part of Mr. Kirk an insult to the citi
zens of Kern County. He declared that
Kirk "rubbed it in" by ordering each se
ries labeled as supplementary books.
Grove L. Johnson, who represented the
Allied Printing Trades Council, replied
with a sarcastic and bitter denunciation
of Attorney Smith's course.
There was no effort made on the part of
Mr. Kirk to be harsh in his dealings with
the board. Ho merely requested that, if
the board were not contemplating any vio
lation of the law, the manual be so re
vised that the general Rublic. as well as
the teachers and pupils, would be able to
understand just .what was meant.
Â¦ Attorney Johnson said after the meet
ing that the parties he represented would
not be satisfied with the mere statement
on the part of Mr. Doub that . the law
would not be violated. Â»He was of the
opinion that there was an effort to over
throw the State textbooks, as was evi
denced by th.e fact that the schools of this
county had not for the past year taken
the State series into consideration.

COUNTY OF KERN
YIELDS TO STATE
M'COY TO WED
A PRAIRIE BELLE
NEWPORT, R. I., July 6.â An unquali
fied victory for the Constitutionâ an over
whelming defea't for the Independence;
a most commendable showing for the old
champion, the Columbiaâ is the record of
the first day's contest of the big sloops
in the Newport Racing Association's
series.
From the firing of the starting gun,
which sent the yachts off to windward in
a light easterly breeze, the Constitution
held her rivals. At the.-turning buoy she
was a little more than two minutes in
advance of the Columbia, while the In
dependence was hul 1 down to leeward.
But it was on the run home that the new
Herreshoff .yacht showed her greatest
strength, beating the Columbia over eight
minutes in the fifteen miles down the
wind, and when the new champion of the
America's cup swept across the line the
Boston yacht was over seven miles
astern.
Owing to the lightness of the wind there
was no brilliant or dramatic scene ' to
chronicle. The race lacked the charm
that attends a scupper breeze, but it was
full of interesting if not exciting events,
nevertheless.
Failure of Independence.
The chief incident of the contest was,
of course, the failure of the Independence
to meet the expectations of her adherents.
That she was a failure In the weather
conditions that prevailed to-day 'cannot
be gainsaid. At no time during the con
test to windward did she show any
weatherly qualities whatever. She did not
point as high as her opponents, nor did
she even for a brief interval demonstrate
that she possessed a fraction of the speed
which she seemed to have shown when
sailing by herself. That she may be vast
ly Improved is possible, but that she pro
foundly disappointed her friends to-day
cannot be concealed, for in light winds
her excellence was chiefly supposed to
rest. When she got fairly out into the
open sea she pounded heavily in the
southwest swell, and the more she pound
ed the more she seemed to lose headway.
So far as the Constitution's success was
concerned it was no more than was ex
pected of her by those who have watched
her keenly since her launch. \ Handled
splendidly and with rare judgment, but
not in the least better than the Columbia,
her superior size and bigger sail plan told.
The boasts of some experts that Nat
Herreshoff had reached his limit when
he designed the Columbia are not justi
fied by to-day's race. Whether the Colum
bia will beat the Constitution in hard
weather remains to be proved. A
The Columbia was sailed in a moÂ»
meriterious manner from start to finish.
All the arts of the professional sea jockey
were practiced by Barr. the sailing mas
ter, and E. D. Morgan, the manager, to
overcome their vastly abler opponent.
That they should have kept the . inferior
boat so close to her . superior antagonist
in the race to the outer mark was a won
derful piece of work. That the Constitu
tion is by far the better all-round boat,
let it blow high or low, is hardly to be
doubted after her showing to-day.
Becord of the Contest.
The following table shows the record of
the race in figures: ;
Elapsed, Corr.
' YACHT. Start. Finish. Time. Time.
Constitution 12:10:02 5:48:C8 5:38:06 6:38:06
Columbia .......: 12:1O:1T 5:59:29 5:49:12 5:47:55
Independence 12:12:00 â¢ ;. ,
â¢Did not finish within time limit
. Thus on corrected, time the Constitution
beat the Columbia by 9 minutes 49 seconds
over the whole course. On the first leg of
the course, the beat to windward, the
Constitution beat the Columbia 1 minute
59 seconds. On the run home the Consti
tution beat the Columbia 9 minutes 8 sec
oeds. The Constitution won by 11 minutes
7 seconds on elapsed time. The Constitu
tion allowed the Independence 43 seconds
and the Columbia 77 seconds. Time at the
outer mark: Constitution, 3:43:35; Colum
bia. 3:45:58.
Duncan, the manager of the Constitu
tion, came ashore at the yacht plub in
his launch just After 8 o'clock this even
ing. When asked if he had anything to
say about the victory of his boat, he
simply stated that all on board were thor
oughly satisfied with her performance.
The Constitution is all ready for the sec
ond race on Monday. She will probably
remain at her moorings to-morrow and
her crew will be given a rest.
The Independence arrived back in the
harbor about 8 o'clock, nearly an hour
after the other two yachts had caught
their moorings. Crownlnshield left the
yacht 'at that time, being taken ashore in
a launch. Soon after the Independence
was moored Lawson went aboard from
thÂ« Decatur and had a chat with Captain
Haft. No one one the Boston' boat would
talk for publication. Chapman, private
secretary for Lawson, said that no one
aboard had any comment to make. He
added that the Independence would be
ready for another race on Monday. No
one on board the yacht seemed depressed
over the poor showing of the yacht, all
treating the matter as the result of hard
luck.

The maximum temperature for the day
In Washington was reported at 2:30 this
afternoon, when the Weather Bureau re
corded S5. which Is two degrees less than
WASHINGTON. July 6.â The backbone
of the hot wave has been broken, at least
temporarily, by showers and thunder
storms that swept over the Atlantic
States and the upper lake region this aft
ernoon, but the Weather. Bureau holds
out no assurances as to the permanency
of the break. Up in Xova Scotia the ba
rometric high pressure area is banked up
to-nlght, giving promise of winds from the
eastward, with cooler weather In its train.
It is very much cooler to-nlght through
JCew Kngland and the storme this, after
noon and evening, according to Forecast
Official Frankenfield, gave promise that
tne r.ext day or two at least will not be
ko abnormally hot as the record-breaking
days of the past week. The mercury has
fallen In greater'' or, Â¦ less degree every
v-here to the east of^ihe Mississippi, while
west of the Mississippi, except in the ex
treme Southwest, tfce temperature Is con
siderably warmer. Further relief in tne
way of showers In the New Bngland and
Middle Atlantic and thunderstorms In the
South, Including part of the West Gulf
States, together with variable winds and
clouds In the lake region, is predicted for
the maximum for the corresponding day
last year. But the storm that broke a
little later caused a drop of 24 degrees
within three and a half hours. The night
Â¦was cool, -with a refreshing 1 breeze.

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
Over at Alameda Point' Hay & Wright
are building another four-masted schooner
for Sanders & Kirchman. For two years
now this firm has been turning out new
vessels as fast as it could build them,, and
new it has enough work ahead/ to keep it
going for twelve months. The new schoorf
er is to be named Samar and will be a
sis-ter ship to the Philippine and Mindora.
There will be no fault to flndy.with the
Samar if she equals her -sisters. . Her
builders say she will excel them. The
Samar will be 175 feet longv 38 feet 6 inches
beam and 14 feet deep. She is intended
for the Philippines and "off shore" trade.
Another Four-Master, Building.
THERE was quite a scene on How
ard-street wharf yesterday prior
to the departure of the steamship
Tucapel of the Companla sud
Americana de Vapores. A de
serted wife, accompanied by a policeman,
was there looking for her husbandiand
four-month-old - baby. The man had told
a number of people that he was going to
South America, but he did not sail on the
Tucapel, or if he did he v/as so securely
stowed away that the crew could not find
him.
Several years ago pretty Lottie Perkins
of 590 Stevenson street met Francisco Cas
sio. He passed himself off as the inter
preter employed by the management of
the Occidental Hotel, and as he spoke
four languages fluently and was an ac
complished musician the young lady be
lieved him. At the Occidental, however,
where he was employed as a waiter^
Francisco was known as Frank Swain*
alias "the Black Diamond."
On April 9, 1899, when Miss Perkins was
18 years of age. Cassio took her to a pic
nic at San Rafael and while there per
suaded her to marry him. For five months
the secret was kept from Lottie's mother.
Soon after it came out that Cassio was
only a waiter and quarrels began. Last
"Wednesday Swain gave up his job at the
Occidental and going home told his wife
he was going to leave. One word" led to
another and Cassio knocked his wife
down. Thafnight he returned home, and
while his wife was in another room he
picked up the four-month-old . baby and
decamped.
Cassio made all his plans for running
away several weeks ago. For the "past
ten days he has been advertising for a
nurse who could speak Spanish only; "and
he evidently secured what he wanted.
Last Wednesday he told .Dr. lturrizaga,
surgeon of the Tucapel, that he was going
to Peru on that steamship as a passenger.
To others he said he was going to play
the "prodigal son" and return to his
father, who is a wealthy planter living
near Lima. His wife swore to a warrant
for his arrest on a charge of battery and
the harbor police are still looking for
him. They are certain that he did not get
away on the Tucapel nor on the Sierra;
and to-day they will keep a watch on the
Curacao that sails for Mexican ports at
10 a. m. â¢
NEW FOUR-MASTED SCHOONER SAMAR, NOW BUILDING AT HAY & WRIGHT'S YARDS, ALAMEDA POINT,
FOR SANDERS & KIRCHMAN. SHE WILL BE A SISTER SHIP TO THE PHILIPPINE AND MINDORA, AND
IS INTENDED FOR THE PHILIPPINE TRADE.

whose life had been despaired of for
weeks after the accident, was discharged
but he will be a cripple for life. The in
juries affected his spine and caused par
alysis of the lower limbs. Dr. Maher,
who had him constantly under observa

Scores of charitable missions are enabling
the children of the poor to go to the sea

patching trainloads of invalids to the

not only in Berlin but throughout Ger
many, owing to the Prussian Government
having extended the period of validity of

THE MOROCCANS
TELLURIDE, Colo.. July 6.â With the
positive information from Lieutenant
Governor Coates, a member of the com
mission appointed by the Governor to in
vestigate the strike in the Smuggler-
Union mine, that Governor Orman would
not send troops, and with the assurance
from the mine managers of the district
that they could not longer afford to close
down to aid him, Arthur L. Collins, gen
eral manager of the Smuggler-Union
mine, this afternoon conceded several
points and a. settlement between himself
and the miners' union was made. This
ends the strike. Many miners will return
to work Monday and within a few weeks
the 1 mine will be opened to something like
its full capacity.
The terms of settlement are looked upon
as a victory for the miners, and to-night
hundreds are celebrating in Telluride. The
tension of the last four days has been re
moved and the miners and citizens alike
are jubilant.
Prominent Men in Council.
The agreement was signed after a con
ference lasting three hours, in which the
following persons participated, in addition
to the local committee of five appointed
at a meeting of the citizens a week ago:
Lieutenant Governor D. C. Coates. Theron
Stevens, Judge of this district, and John
Murphy, attorney for the miners' union,
the three composing the Governor's com
mission; Arthur L. Collins, general man
ager of the Smuggler-Union mines; Pres
ident St. John and Secretary Carpenter
of the local union, and T. M. Sullivan of
the executive committee of the Western
Federation of Miners. The local union
held a meeting to-night and declared the
strike off. . â¢ â¢
By the terms of the settlement non
union men may be employed In the Smug
gler-TJnion mines. It is certain, however,
that the union miners will not allow non
union men to remain so any longer than
they can help. The union is permitted,

SAN JOSE, July 6.â By acquitting Sam

mitted the breach of law, a jury ln a Jus

shoot the birds and were arrested with
them in their possession. | A number of re
putable witnesses j swore to these facts.
Devito admitted having killed : the quail,
but pleaded that they did not resemble the
quail of Italy and consequently he did not
know they. were such. .On these grounds
the jury acquitted, him. Devito had pre
viously agreed to plead guilty, if he were

6. If the president or secretary of thÂ«
union shall at this time represent to the man'
agement of the mine that any contractor is 'In-
through its president or secretary, to de
clare a man incompetent and order his
discharge. This feature of the settlement
Is a distinct advantage to the union and
will enable the union to regulate unionism
in the mines. The secretary is given the
right to visit the mine at any time and
can order the measuring of the men's
work whenever he wishes, even though
the man has worked but one hour. He
can also order the payment of the men
at any time. The Liberty Bell and Tom
Boy mines, which were closed during the
Smuggler-Union trouble, will also open
again Monday morning.
Agreement Bringing Peace. /
The following ls the text of the agree
ment:
1. 'The union expresses Its entire disapproval
of the recent outrages.
3. - The company agrees not to discriminate
against the union nor tho members thereof, and
the union and the members thereof undertake
not to interfere with or molest non-union men.
3. The company agrees to let the president or
secretary of the local union have full access to
Its surface property at all reasonable hours,
provided that the work of the men ls not Inter
fered with.
4. The union agrees to use all its influence to
stop the Illicit selling of liquor in Marshall Ba
sin or around the mine.
6. The company, is to have the right to let
contracts to any men who wish to take them.
All such contracts are to be on printed forms,
which are hereafter to be drafted by J. H. Mur
phy, representing the union and Jacob Fllllus,
representing the company. Such contracts are
to be for the period of one month, at the end
of which time the work done under the terms
thereof shall be measured up, and If It shall ap
pear that the contractor has not earned three
dollars or more per shift the company under
takes or agrees either to pay off the contractor
at the contract rate or to raise the contract price
pro rata; that ls to say, the price for the work
will be raised so as to make lt equivalent to $3

Campflre Scintillations.
Camp Reverie, Forestville, July 6, 1901.â
"Jack is coming for a day at Camp Rev
erie," said a lady who, with her four chil
dren, had been guests at the camp since
Its opening, "and he simply despises sum
mer resorts. I wonder will he take us
home."
I wondered myself how he would like
us. I knew Jack for a cynical, blase,
much-traveled man; I had never written
him down for an Abou-ben-Adhem, and
eo I watched him a bit out of the corner
of my eye. But Jack came, saw and was
conquered, for as he bade his family good
by I heard him say to the little golden
haired girl wno hung about his neck,
"Good-by, puss; papa will be up next Sat
urday."
The early part of last evening was given
up to the children, of whom there is a de
lightful little party. Master Leonard Je
rome of Oakland with his ragtime songs
gave much pleasure to his friends, big and
little. After a dance and a Cakewalk thev
reluctantly left the campflre and went to
bed, when Mrs. Alice Heynemann read a
story to the "grown-up children who were
gathered about the fire.

BRUSSELS, July 6.â The Petit Bleu
says that Kruger has lately refused to
entertain proposals' to arm privateers, but
that the promoters are again urging the
former President of the South African re
public to notify the powers that unless
they intervene he will issue letters of
marque. In the event of Kruger's contin
ued refusal the promoters propose to act
without authorization.
WASHINGTON,- July 6.â The report
from Brussels that former President
Kruger, being urged to notify the. powers
that unless they intervene in the South
African contest he will commission pri
vateers. Is not treated seriously here. It
ls well understood as an outcome . of the
war with Spain that the United States
Government will never again, except in
the most extraordinary emergency, issue
letters of marque, and the same reasons
impel the Government from recogniz
ing any such warrants issued by any other
nation even were that nation in full stand
ing.
ln the case of the Spanish war both of
the belligerents, by agreement, refrained,
from issuing commissions to privateers,
and it now has been many years since the
flag of any respectable nation has flown
over such craft. In the case of Krugrer it
ls extremely doubtful whether he would,
if the issue were forced in this way, be
recognized as a de facto President author
ized to issue commissions to privateers.
That point would have to be settled at the
outset and each nation whose commerce
was affected or was threatened by the pri
vateers would determine for ; Itself his
competency. I It is scarcely to be expected
that they would decide against their own
commercial interests, so that Kruger's
privateers would find it difficult to secure
general recognition. ' -. "Â¦' t. â¢
The threat to send out privateers with
out President Kruger's consent Is idle. It
ls pointed out here that such craft would
be pirates pure and simple and the civil
ized world would sweep them off the Beas

department of the convention, ln a letter
to William McMurray, chairman of the
exhibition committee, Bishop John W.
Hamilton says:
It will not be possible for our many visitors
who come to California during the Epworth
League convention- to visit every part of the
State before they . go away. The next best
thing has been done by our hospitable people;
by a happy stroke the State has been brought
to the vlsitors-^not the mountains and valleys
themselves, but their products. No one will
Â«ee California as It is unless much time is
spent in the exhibit of coast products in the
Mechanics' Pavilion in seeing the exhibits*
which ccme from all over the State.
The people have brought of their substance,
what is much more to the credit of California
than all of the gold taken out of her gulches.
"The production of something where nothing
was before is an act of greater energy than
expansion cr decoration of the thing produced."
California produces what the world both need*
and applauds. Do not fail to see the exhibit.
We are Justly proud of what we grow; faith

IMPOSING FINES
ON MILITIAMEN
Captain Nerney Decides
to Test the New
State Law.
Members Absent Prom Last
Parade' Are Subject to .'
Punishment. /
The members of 'the local organizations
of the National Guard are still resting
from the work of the week in camp and at
the armories are discussing what advan
tages were gained during the encampment
on Laveaga Heights. Such, if any, will
become apparent during the next . few
months in the discipline, the school of trie
soldier and the management by the offi
cers.
The law requires that all members of
the National Guard shall parade on the
Fourth of July unless prevented by phys
ical disability, absence from the place of
parade on business or inability to be ex
cused from employment. The small num
ber of men who were in the ranks on the
Fourth was a subject of remark and it is
likely that many of the above excuses will
be' presented. Â¦Â¦ Captain Nerney of the Na
val Militia declares that so many men and
officers were absent that he will not ac
cept excuses unless they are bona fide.
He proposes to put the absentees on tne
defensive. He will impose a tine, as piu
vided by law, on each, and then nave the
Shenft make the collection. In case of
failure to pay the delinquent will be
brought up before a court-inaitiai. This
he proposes to do with a view of testing
the law which authorizes the irnposiuoa
of a tine on those who without valid ex
cuse absent themselves from parade.
The Naval Militia came very near los
ing the Marion, which has been loaned by
the United States Navy Department to
the State for the use of the militia. About
tha time that the present commander as
sumed command there was ' sent to the
Navy Department a complaint that tne
vessel was not properly cared for, and, in
fact, was filthy and a disgrace to the
navy. After inquiry the Navy Department
must have concluded that the compiaim
was well founded, for an order was Issued
directing the State authorities to return
the Marion to the navy yard at Mare Isl
and. When the new commander took
charge he was unaware that any com
plaint had been made. He found the ship
in such a filthy condition that he at once
had the men turn to and give her a com
plete overhauling and had got her in the
condition that a man-of-war should be as
to cleanliness when he became aware that
the order alluded to had been Issued. He
at once communicated with the Navy De
partment, stating what had been done,
and wrote that the* former condition of
the vessel should not be charged to hlÂ»
administration. He also called for an In
spection. The Navy Department must
have concluded that the objection was a
just one, for it rescinded the order and di
rected that an officer from the navy yard
make an inspection as asked for. Upon
the report of that officer will depend
whether the Marion shall be returned to
Rotten Row at Mare Island or be re
tained by the Naval MiJitia.

A BRAIN FOOD AND REPAIRER.
Every minister, lawyer. Journalist, phy-
sician, author or business man is forced
under pressure of modern conditions to
the active and sometime* overactive use
of the brain. Analysis of the excreta
thrown out by the pores shows that brain
work breaks down the phosphate of pot-
ash, separating: it from its heavier com-
panion, albumen, and plain common sense
teaches that this elemental principle must
be introduced into the body anew each
day If we would replace the loss and re-
build the brain tissue.
We know that the phosphate of potash,
as presented in certain field grains, has
an affinity for albumen and that is the
only way gray matter in the brain can be
built. It will not answer to take the crude
phosphate of potash of the drug shop, for
nature rejects it. The elemental mineral
must be presented through food directly
from Nature's laboratory.
These facts have been made use of in
the manufacture of Grape-Nuts', and any
brain worker can prove the value of the
proper selection of food by making free
use of Grape-Nuts for ten days or two
weeks. Bold by grocers everywhere (and
in immense Quantities). Manufactured
by the Postum Cereal Co., Ltd., Battle
Creek, .Michigan. .. .

Are making: It a Practice to Pass
Worthless Checks on Busi
ness Men.
Warrants were sworn out yesterday for
the arrest of two men who are passing
forged checks on business men, and they
seem to be doing a brisk trade from, the
number of complaints received at police
headquarters.
Edward Harris, who conducts a cloth
ing store at 626 Kearny street, swore to a
warrant for the arrest of J. K. White on
the charge -of forgery in Judge Fritz's
court. White cashed a check for $24 50
with Charles Newman of the Rfchelieu
saloon, which purported to be signed by
Harris. The check was dated June 22
and was made payable to "J. K. White,"
who indorsed it. Harris pronounced his
signature a forgery. . -
B. E. Lasky, camera supply store, 42
Third street, secured a warrant from
Judge Mogan for the arrest of "John
Doe" on a charge of forgery. The man
called at Lasky's store, representing him
self to be Dr. J. B. Crawford of the Stan
dard Electrical Works, and bought sev
enty cents worth of roods. Â¦ He gave a
check in payment for $20 purporting to be
signed by William B. Angus for the Stan
dard Electrical Works, and made payable
to "J. B. Crawford." He indorsed "the
check and got the balance, $19 30. The
check was a forgery. The same man
passed a forged check on Lasky's brother
the previous day.

R. J. Techau filed an application yester
day with the Board of Supervisors for a
reduction from $20,000 to $10,000 on the im

Mason street, near Eddy. Leslie Wright
petitioned that the assessment of $35,750 on
property at the northwest corner of Ellis
and Jones streets, owned by Anna Luhrs
be reduced to $25,000.
Â¦Warrants were sworn out yesterday by
Policeman Wedekind for the arrest of
Edith Sanford and Virgie Sanford of the

Mrs. M. Tracey Jones, proprietress of the
restaurant at 287 O'Farrell street, on the
charge of selling liquor without a license.
Edith and Vlrgie Sanford were arrested,
and Edith, who gave the name of Marie
Allen, was also charged with grand lar

Smith, an ex-member of the Forty-third

The Board of Health sent a communica
tion yesterday to the Board of Education
explaining the operation of the act of
1899 'providing for the vaccination of pub
lic school children whose parents are pe
cuniarily unable to pay the expense there
of. The Board of Education will be re
quired to carry out the provisions of the
law next Wednesday, when the Health
Board will surrender its power formerly
exercised In the premises. The School
Board must bear the expenses, but the
vaccination will be under the supervision
of the Board of Health. To that end it
will simply be necessary to supply the
vaccine and the salary of the vaccinator.
If the board will fix certain hours each
day for vaccination of school children it
would not reauire the entire time of the
physician, and the expense will be less.
The expense is estimated, at $1800 per
year; $600 for vaccine and $1200 for a vac
cinator. The Board of Education will
hold a meeting next Tuesday to. consider
the suggestions of the Health Board and
formulate a plan to carry out the law.

Clever Eastern Crook Successfully
Despoils a Number of Saloon-
Eeepers.
During the past week a smooth Eastern
crook for. whom the police are anxiously
searching cleverly worked the card ma
chines in various saloons and secured
several hundred dollars. His scheme was
to visit a saloon and while the attention
of the bartender was temporarily distract
ed he would insert a key in the card ma
chine and abstract the contents. Among
nls principal victims are Marks & Adler,
â¢who conduct the Davy -Crockett saloon on
Market street, near Stockton. Recently
they missed the usual number of nickels
placed in their machines, and suspecting
that a clever crook was at work they de
cided to catch him in the act. A private
detective was called in and at his sugges
tion the proprietors gave him the privi
lege of occupying a small room in the rear
of the saloon so that he could sit and wait
for the thief. .
Early yesterday morning the detective
visited the saloon, and after announcing
bis mission to at least a half dozen peo
ple who were present ordered the bar
tender to place the card machines in a
position so that he could command a full
view of them. The bartender, thinking
that the fellow was a faker, refused to do
his bidding and ordered him to leave the
Ealoon.
Last night the services of the regular
police force were enlisted by several sa
loon-keepers to run down the thief. From
the clever manner In which he works Cap
tain Seymour is satisfied that he is an ex
perienced hand at the business.

There being no more volunteers to oc

it will soon become a thing of the past.
Quarters for 7000 men have been main

and on many occasions every' tent has
been occupied.
In a few days the work of demolishing
the camp will be commenced. Only enough
tents will be kept standing to furnish tem
porary homes for the regular soldiers now
en route from Manila.
The batteries and companies of artillery
and the regiments of Infantry and cavalry
now due here have all been assigned to
garrisons throughout the United States,
and in consequence will remain at the
Presidio but a few days.
The fir^t of the regular troops to return
from the Orient left the Presidio yester
day for Vancouver Barracks. The Tenth
Battery of Field Artillery, known to his
tory as Reilly's battery, arrived here but
a few days ago and remained in camp
only long enough to collect the baggage of
the men and secure transportation to its

Cole has stated to the investigators that
when he arranged his combination on the
vault DlmmicTc assisted him by working
the levers and tumblers, and that it was
possible for Dimmick to have become ac
quainted with the combination.- Dimmick
has admitted that he explained the work
ings of the levers and tumblers to Cole,
but says it was not possible for him to
have learned the combination of Cole at
the time the system was arranged.
Yesterday's investigation by Federal of
ficials was made in the hope of discover
ing whether it was possible for certain
employes of the Mint to have discovered
the combination used by Cashier Cole on
the door of his working vault.
W. K. Cole was formerly in the drug
business in Martinez. He was appointed
cashier in the Mint two years ago, and
his character is beyond reproach. Cole
lives with his wife and three young chil
dren at 1S27 Sacramento street. Mrs.
Cole belonged to the wealthy Fernandez
family of Contra Costa County, her father
being rated as a millionaire. From the
time Cole became cashier in the Mint he
usually spent his evenings at home, an oc
casional visit being made to the Union
League Club after leaving the Mint at 3
p. m.
Dimmick's character has never been
questioned, and his favorite amusement
was a game of chess at the Union League
Club. He was formerly engaged as an
agent and broker in Portland, Or. He
then went to Santa Barbara, where he
married a daughter of Judge Wright and
worked as a clerk in the Santa Barbara
County National Bank.- Twelve years ago
he removed to Almeda County and en
gaged in the commission. business in this
city. He was appointed as cashier in the
Mint by Superintendent Leach, and held
that office until succeeded by W. K. Cole.
Dimmick paid little attention yesterday
to the warning of Superintendent Leach
that he must not talk. Where other em
ployes, including Cashier Cole, positively
declined to answer questions^ Dimmick
entered into certain explanations. He de
nied again that he knew the combination
of the cashier's vault as arranged' by
Cole, but admitted that he showed Cole
how to work the levers and tumblers
when Cole came into office two years ago.
Dimmick declined to say whether he fixed
the tumblers on the back of the vault
door while Cole worked the combination
knob on. the front of the door. Me also
refused to affirm or deny the statement
that Superintendent Cole had informed
him three months ago to look for another
position.
Dimmick knows that he is being watched
by secret service men, and has the air of
a worried man. Cole, the cashier, who
alone was supposed to know the combina
tion of the vault, is attending to his du
ties, but keeps silent when questioned.
Pedlar yesterday changed the combina
tion on the cashier's vault and placed a
copy of the combination in a sealed en
velope, depositing it with Superintendent
Leach. : .-
Superintendent Leach refuses to affirm
or deny the truth of the story that three
months ago he informed Chief Clerk Dim
mick that his services would be no longer
required and that he had better i look for
another position. Â¦ ~ ,
"I do not know how that story got
out," said Leach, "and at this time I can
not say whether it is true or not. We are
proceeding with our Investigation as ' to
the robbery of $30,000, but â¢ 1 cannot give
out anything we have discovered." V
Cashier W. K. Cole and Chief Clerk
Walter Dimmick were at their desks yes
terday, but the responsibility of their- of-*
fices rested on Frank A. Pedlar and Ben
jamin W. Day, respectively. -
Mint Director Roberts, Superintendent
Leach and Secret Service Agent Hazen
examined a number of the Mint employes
yesterday. Men and women engaged in
various departments of the Mint were
closely questioned, and all the employes
were warned to -maintain silence and an
swer no questions on the outside.^ Sum
mary dismissal will be the fate 6t any
employe who violates the warning.
Secret Service Agent. Hazen is satisfied
that the stolen gold was removed; from
the Mint building, and he i3 now engaged
in trying to locate the coin. , ; Hazen and
his assistants are tracing the movements
of certain Mint employes during the- past
six months, and it is hoped that the work
will furnish the missing link to the chain
of evidence essential for the arrest of the
suspected employe. ;
The robbery of $30,000 in gold coin from
the cashier's vault in the Mint still re
mains unsolved. Yesterday's Investigation
helped to strengthen the chain of evidence
around a suspected employe, but the di
rect testimony necessary to warrant a
conviction In the Federal . courts is still
lacking.

STANISLAUS RIVER PROJECT OR TUO-
YUBA RIVER PROJECT.
City Engineer Grunsky - yesterday sub
mitted to the Board of Public "Works a
revised report" on the estimated cost of
bringing water from the Yuba, Stanislaus
and Tuolumne rivers. The report was im
mediately transmitted to the Mayor, who
will forward it to the Board of Supervi
sors to-morrow. The report shows that
the cost of bringing water from the Sier
ra Nevada sources for a delivery of 30,
000,000 gallons per day In a single pipe
line falls as low as 8.53 cents per 1000 gal
lons, and that If a double line of pipe be
used the cost will be 9.63 cents per 1000 gal
lons. . v
When the works are planned with an
expansion to 100,000.000 gallons a day as
ultimate capacity, the cost of the .water
delivered by a single pipe line would be
8.49 cents per 1000 gallons, and 10.39 cents
per 1000 gallons if delivered in two pipes.,
each having a capacity of 15,000,000 gal
lons. . . \
City Engineer Grunsky states that the
following figures are subject to revision
and may be used as a basis of what the
cost of bringing water from the three
sources named may be In the future:.

A crowd of boys carried away a portion
of a building on Prescott court, near Val
lejo street, last evening and caused a riot
that claimed the attention of the police
for a couple of hours.
The building which- the young vandals
partly demolished was adjacent to one of
the tenement houses destroyed by fire on
the morning of July 3. It had been
drenched with water to an extent that
rendered it unfit for habitation, and the
occupants removed to other quarters.
About T'Vclock last night a mob of
boys visited the property^ and started to
tear the building down. They carried
doors, windows and lumber away with > a
rapidity that startled the neighbors. Sev
eral-residents in-the vicinity made a pro
test, but were driven away by showers of
bricks. When the owner of the building
attempted to stop the malicious work he
was accorded the same treatment. A riot
alarm, was sent to the central police sta
tion, and Sergeant Christiansen with a
posse of officers started for the scene.- It
took some time for the policemen to sup
press the commotion. .
Â¦ A search was made for the stolen lum
ber and, some of It was recovered. Ansal
do Jovana, an Italian fisherman, in whose
bouse one of the doors was found 'was
arrested and charged with petty larceny.

MALICIOUS BOYS
WRECK BUILDING
that the explosion was not caused by his
corporation. However. . he ordsred his
carpenters to repair some of the damage
and engaged a policeman, to . guard . the
premises. In discussing the accident, Mr.
Crockett said it was similar to the one
that occurred in front of the Phelan
building a year ago. He says these acci
dents are likely to occur at any time, de
spite the precautions taken to prevent
them. The electric currents that escape
from the underground wires pass over the
pipes and the current eats Into the iron.
The damage is not discovered until tiie
odor of gas gives warning.
Before the Explosion.
Many hours before the explosion the
storekeepers in the vicinity of the build
ing noticed the odor of gas. Mr. Johnson
and the Spreckels Market people tele
phoned to the gas company that there wa3
a leak. Men were sent Immediately to re
pair the pipe and were working In front
of the building when the gas exploded.
It has often been said that rats will
leave a sinking ship. The stallkeepera In
the Spreckels Market can vouch that
scores of rodents scampered to places of
safety long before the explosion occurred.
They were evidently driven out by tha
gas. .
There was a rumor rife that represent
atives of a local electric lleht company
â¢were responsible for the accident. It Is
claimed that two men from the company
were at work in the basement looking for
a defective wire. They were lowered into
the basement and a few seconds later Wal
ter Pantry, â¢ the janitor of the building,
who was standing .near the entrance of
the elevator on the main floor, .heard ono
of the men ask the other if he had a
candle. The man then scenting eras re
marked that-the. use of a light might be
dangerous In such an atmosphere. A few
minutes later Pantry was thrown off hia
feet. On regaining his equilibrium he
rushed out to the entrance and wasÂ» in
time to see the sidewalk rise up and then
fall into the basement
thrown to the floor and suffered a broken
wrist. McClure Cowen, an elevator man
emploved In the building, was standing
in the Stevenson-street entrance and was
blown half way into the street, but .for
tunately escaped injury. Mr. Lyons claims
that he is in no way responsible for the
explosion. He says the bSseraent was
occupied by Whitaker, Ray & Co. He be
lieves his "damage is very heavy, as he
'will have to dispose of the stock and fix
tures. He had to close his place of busi
ness and disanpoint many customers.
Lyons is insured.
Whitaker. Ray & Co. were unable to
assess their loss. Mr. Wigstfn of that
company stated that blackboards and
hundreds cf desks were stored in the
basement and only a close examination of
the school furniture will disclose the dam
ape. He says the company is insured.
The building itself is damaged In many
jMaces. It was built immediately after
the great Bancroft fire, which occurred
fifteen years ago. The walls were crack
ed and the flooring was forced upward by
the explosion. It is understood that the
building was covered by Insurance. Th6
damape to the structure is said to amount
to ?4000. Â¦ â¢ Â¦ -.;Â¦ =:"/ V :
Cause of Explosion.
The cause of the explosion was discov
ered an -hour or two after It happened.
It appears that the gas pipe of the Pa
cific Lighting Company, which runs close
and parallel to the curb in front of the
History building, sprung a leak and the
pas found an outlet In the basement of
the structure.- This leak was caused by
two electric wires crossing the pipe. The
great heat generated burned through the
iron and. made a hole two inches in diam
eter The workmen. had to tear up , the
street In four places before they could
locate the break. , . â
President Joseph B. Crockett of the San
Francisco Gas Light Company was on the
scene immediately after the explosion.
He set a number of men at work investi
gating the affair and was relieved to find
Mrs. Hammond's request that he return
her some articles in it of no possible value
to him the burglar emptied it of its con
tents, took some $23 and odd cents that it
contained and requested the butler to
show him out "f the front door. He was
so cool that in was perhaps contagious.
At all events Miss Hammond asked him
at this point how he got In.
"You just keep your windows closed,"
he said, "and you will never be troubled
by burglars."
"But you will not hurt us, will you?"
Miss Hammond said.
"I would not hurt a hair of your head,
miss. I think loo much of my own sis
ters."
"And you will take this money and try
to be good â for the sake of your sisters?"
Miss Hammond went on.
burglar coolly met him at the door of
jlrs. Hammond's room with a drawn re
volver. "You come any further," ob
served the burglar, "and you are a dead
man." Irwin <1id not come anv further.
Then the burglar turned to the ladies,
bowing most courteously:
"I really do not want to alarm you, la
dies," he said. "I have a mother and sis
ters myself. But I must have money."
"Bring him my purse, Mary," said Mrs.
Hammond, who was pretty cool herself,
all things considered.
A MOST gentle mannered burglar,
in a light tan overcoat and a
black derby hat, is at work in the
swell neighborhood about Jack
son arid Steiner streets. He has
en apparent scar above his right eye, but
cs the scar may have been painted in to
assist his disguise this mark is not to be
relied upon.
The burglar entered the residence of A.
B. Hammond, at 2C10 Jackson street, a lit
tle before midnight last night. Mr. Ham
nioiid is out of town, but Mrs. Hammond,
her daughter Florence and the servants,
a butler and a maid, were at home. The
ladies of the family slept on the second
floor of the mansion, the servants on the
floor above. The burglar made his en
trance through a closet window at the
back of the house on the second floor,
reaching the window by the aid of a shed.
end passed from the closet into the bed
room of Mrs. Hammond, that lady having
neglected to lock her door, a most un
usual circumstance. The family had re
tired and Mrs. Hammona had herself shut
off the electric light, but she was not
asleep, Â¦when she became conscious of the
presence of some one in her room. She
Fpoke ut once the name of her daughter
ttrA of Mary Dok. the maid, and then the
p<=r.tlemanly burglar leaned over her and
' taid, in a low, beautifully modulated
voice:
"Make any outcry and I will shoot you."
He had a revolver in his hand and there
FPfcmed came danger that he would carry
ft his threat. Mrs. Hammond, much
1 ehtened, said nothing, and when her
daughter answered her call from the next
room the burglar whispered to her again:
"Tell her that ycu were dreamingâ that
you are all right."
The lady did as she â¢was bidden, and
â¢would have remained silent in all proba
bility while her house was being plun
dered had she not thought that she de
tected the odor of chloroform. Then she
arose. "You cannot chloroform me!" she
cried. "Florence, Mary, there is a burglar
In the house!"
At once Miss Florence Hammond gave
the alarm, and Francis Irwin. the butler,
came rushing down from his bedroom on
the third floor. He had no arms, and the
BOY RUN DOWN
BY TROLLEY CAR
So Badly Hurt That He
Suffers Loss of His
Right Leg.
Early yesterday morning little Howard
Holy, seven years old, whose home Is at
904% Folsom street, was run over by an
electric car running south on that street.'
The child was playing on the track when
the accident occurred, and tbe motorman
did not Bee him in time to check the mo
mentum of the car. The little fellow was
knocked down and so seriously hurt that
upon being taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal It was seen that amputation of the
right leg would be necessary.
The attendants at the hospital ax once
telephoned to Chief Surgeon Bunneli. who
had g-cne to the Morgue as a witness In a
Coroner's Jnquest, and without waiting: to
give his testimony Dr. Bunneli at once
returned to the hospital. Entering the
operating room he saw that an operation
was Instantly necessary and the surgeon
prepared to operate.
In the meantime Coroner Leland, finding
his witness missing, sent an officer with
a subpena after Bunneli. The officer went
to the Receiving- Hospital, and finding the
chief surgeon with his apron on ready to
operate discreetly refrained from serving
the Eubpena and the operation proceeded.
There is every hope, the surgeons say.
that the little victim of the trolley car
trill survive his injuries.
After the operation had been per
formed Dr. Funnell explained that he had
had a dispute with Coroner Leland rela
tive to the duties of the chief surgeon.
Dr. Kunr.ell, according to his own view,
thought hie place was at the . hospital
when a patient In a critical condition was
to be operated . upon, jj Coroner
PEDESTRIANS on Market street
1 were startled at 8:45 o'clock yes
terday morning by ' a terrific ex
plosion.' Gas had accumulated in
the basement of Bancroft Hls
tcry building at 723 Market street and 1n
some unknown manner became ignited.
The explosion that followed played havoc
with the cement sidewalk and other por
tions of the building.
Market street was crowded with people
at this hour and, fortunately, only a
few pedestrians were passing at the
time over,.. the spot where the ex
plosion occurred. Argello Arata, a
-recent arrival from Alaska, who lives at
309 Broadway, was one of the..unfortu
nates to be there at the Inopportune mo
ment. He received burns about the face
and hands and a severe shaking up. Will
ing hands lifted him out of his position of
periland he was. quickly sent out. to the
Emergency Hospital. Rumors that a
number of people had been killed spread,
and brave men examined the ruins to dis
cover if any one else was engulfed. The

Ropes Immediately Stretched.
The - police were immediately on the
scene. . Ropes were stretched and curious
people were kept In the background.
Every precaution was taken to prevent a
second explosion; but in this the work
men failed. The big service pine which
fiupplied the tenants of the builcCng with
gas was broken off by. the fall oj.'he con
crete, and the gas poured out.. The first
thought was to stop the flow, and this
was done with startling results. When the
broken pipe was capped the gas was driv
en-back and filled the manholes, an elec
tric spark Ignited the fluid, and there were
loud reports. The Iron covers of the man
holes were blown some distance into the
air,, and pedestrians Â¦ and horses i wero
treated to , another scare. Ernest Herbst
of 839 Bryant street was severely burned.
Ezcitement in Hestaurant.
The scene in the Bancroft building after
the explosion was extremely exciting. The
men and women employed In the various
offices and factories were frightened by
the noise and locking of the big building,
and fearing that death was near made
wild attempts to escape the danger.' They
ran down the stairs and out. through the
Stevenson straet exit. Many of them
crowded on the fire escapes, and there
was some danger of them falling off.
Cool head's in the street below advised the
frightened people that all danger was past
and advised them to re-enter the building.
Many of them d-d.so, but a dozen or more
feared to risk it. ' . "~
Johnson's restaurant, which is in the
building, was crowded with people at the
time of the accident. The diners were
startled by the roar and rattle of broken
glass and dishes and .with ona concerted
movement- dashed for the door. The in
terio'r of the eating establishment sufEeied
somewhat from the explosion. The floor
ing was ripped up in a number of places,
the transom was broken and the glasses
In the windows were shattered. Counters
were blown upward and a big hole was
opened in the floor. Dishes were thrown
from the tables and the plastering was
cracked and loosened in a dozen places.
Charles Lvons, who conducts a tailor
ing establishment at 721 Market street,
was the greatest sufferer through the ex
plosion. The windows were shattered and
the dust thrown up by the explosion cov
ered the Roods in his establ'shmsnt. The
flooring and dressing-rooms were darn
acred by:the shock and the plastering was
also damnsred. The. srreatest damatre was
done In the hack of the store. Six big
windows used to Hphten the -place were
blown out Into the street, and . it is
miraculous that passing people were not
cut by the fly'ng glass. A heavy iron

fell with 1 clutter to the sidewalk. The

leading thereto were spiit and ruined.

In his monthly , report for June,* sub
mitted yesterday to. the Board of Educa

tion to the dilapidated condition of the
Washington Grammar school building and
urges that steps be taken to remedy the
matter. Deputy Jordan, who made a per
sonal Inspection of the school, says in his
report: ,Â¦ * . -
The building of this school is condemned as
old, unsightly and unsanitary. The windows
are so poor, the walls and ceilings so old and
grimy that if pupils retain self-respect It must
be due to extraordinary Influence on, the part
of the teachers. The impression of a visitor
would be that school , authorities had sadly
neglected this school. \ Acting principal and
teachers were found generally ready to co
operate with the deputy on all matters set
â¢orth in accordance with the- directions or the
Superintendent. The first grade is in especial
ly good hands.
Deputy Superintendent Kingsbury re
ports that he visited the Lowell High School
;in<l found the classes to be in good con
dition. The school lacks some necessary
"aclllties in the scientific department. The
Girls' High School classes were found to
be doing satisfactory work. The Lincoln
Evening- School was completely inspected
ind the teachers found to be in earnest
ind giving close attention to their work.
Much complaint exists concerning the
luality of the ink furnished this school. It
s thick and so. adhesive as to be unfit for

he addition of water causes it to be so
iight as to be scarcely readable.

The story of the manner in which Rob
ert G. "Wilson shot and killed little. Maggie
Hartwell on Shipley street was retold yes
terday in the inquest before Coroner Ice
land. All the witnesses united in' saying
that Wilson fired the fatal shot. Although
they did not see the revolver, they saw
him raise his hand, saw the flash of the
pistol and saw little Maggie fall immedi
ately.
George Hartwell, the 16-year-old brother
of the dead girl, said that some of the
children threw a firecracker on Wilson's
porch, where Wilson was sitting, and that
immediately Wilson stepped down to the
sidewalk, raised his right hand in the
manner of a man about to fire a pistol
and that there was a Hash and a report
from /Wilson's hand. Immediately there
after Maggie fell to the sidewalk and said,
"Wilson shot me." Maggie was on the
sidewalk with other boys and girls about
seventy-five feet away from Wilson and
in the street was a large bonfire which
threw its light upon the accused and the
crowd of boys and girls at which he fired.
ft All the witnesses said that "Wilson was
disliked by the children In the neighbor
hood, because he showed his hatred for
them. He owned another house on the
opposite side of the street and In front
of which the bonfire had been burning.
The immediate provocation for the shoot
ing, they said, was the throwing of- the
firecracker upon Wilson's porch. Edward
Gegan. Laura Chessman, Mrs. Catama
tori and others saw the flash near Wil
son's hand at the time the shot was flred.
Maggie said to several of. the boys and
girls who gathered around her that Wil
son had shot her.
The accused man is large and powerful,
although his hair and beard are gray with
the frosts of sixty winters. He sat with
his counsel, Robert Ferrall and ex-Judge
Bahrs. By advice of his attorneys, he did
not make any statement.
The jury did not deliberate more than
five minutes on his case before they re
turned the folio wins verdict:
That the said Masrgle Hartwell. age about 11
years, nativity California,' occupation schoolgirl,
residence 206 Shipley street, came to her death
at the Central Emergency Hospital. July 5,
through gunshot wound through body.
And we, the Jury, - further find that Maggie
Hartwell came to her death of a jmnshot wound
flred by Rohert G. Wilson, and we charge said
Robert G. Wilson with murder. â¢
"Wilson appeared in Judge Conlan's court
yesterday morning on the charge of mur
der. The defendant was instructed as to
his rights, and. by consent the case was
continued till next Wednesday.

Wilbur Kyle Wins Again.
SAN DIKGO. July 6.â The second race
for the championship of tho State- be
tween E. B. Stolle of San Francisco and
Wilbur Kyle of San Diego was won to
day by the latter, though the race was
unsatisfactory in nearly all respects. It
was to be a mile race, but no course was
mapped out and the boys agreed to swim
to the United States steamship Pinta and
return. Through a misunderstanding of
the effects of the tide Stolle missed the
steamer and went some distance farther
before turning. On the way back he also
miscalculated the effect of the tide and
reached the Commercial wharf more than
100 feet farther down the bay than he
should have landed. The time made was
18 minutes and 50 seconds, -but the dis
tance was hardly a mile.

dom. .
Following arÂ© the day's results with
Judge John Grace's official scores:
For Freedom won his trial without al
lowing his opponent to score. In .his last
time out the rejuvenated hound was
paired with the same Rosie Clair and won
out. He was given a baÂ« fall at the time
and showed plainly in yesterday's course
by the way he limped that he had not re
covered from it. His snappy work, how
ever, has set the hope that the once great
dog will again rank among the stake win
ners.
Agamemnon ran a great course against
Plough Boy and showed considerable im
provement.
Palo Alto, at prohibitive odds, holds first
place as choice for flnal honors. Three to
one at opening time, Geary's champion
was cut to 9 to 5 at the close of the run
down. Ireland is at 8. The Pasha Kennels'
youngster, Royal Archer, led him and took
first and second turn in their course and
would have won could he but have got the
kill. This shows that Ireland is not up to
his speed or that Archer is a better dog
than the talent wants to credit him with
being.
Flying Fox a.t 7, Luxor, Anchor and
Wedgewood at 8 is the way the wise ones
figure the odds. Harlean Gladys opened at
6 and closed at 4. Fifteen short ends, the
better portion of which were at good odds,
helped to make a bad day for the talent.
Just at the close of the day's sport at
Union Park yesterday the once peerless
racing dog For Freedom gave an exhibi
tion of coursing that showed that the old
timer has yet a bit of the proper stuff In
his make-up. For Freedom . went to the
slips with Rosie Clair, and when once in
sight of the jack, set a pace that gave the
crowd a surprise. With a display of dash
and energy like that of the champion of
old, the courser made a sensational run
ning pick-up, rolling over three or four
times In his effort to hold the game.
Palo Alto at Prohibitive
Odds Is the Stake
Favorite.
FAST COURSERS
OUT FOR HONORS
The people of San Francisco are prepar
ing for the reception of the visitors, and
the bundesfest will be made a 1 season for
celebration.
Letters and telegrams received at the
headquarters of the National Shooting
Bund of the United States In this city
within the past two days Indicate that a
larger number of sharpshooters are com
ing to San Francisco to participate in the
contests, commencing July 14. than was
anticipated. The New York Independent
Schuetzen left New York yesterday on a
special train heading for San Francisco.
One special started from Brooklyn bear
ing the other riflemen of Greater New
York. It is now estimated that nearly
3000 riflemen from all parts of the Union
will attend the festival during the ten
days.
The prizes thus far on hand are valued
at about $100,000 at a conservative estir
mate. This aggregation of costly gold and
silver ware will be displayed in the park
where the shooting festival is to be held.
A palace for prizes, constructed of plate
glass panels set in gilded rods, will con
tain the -many gifts, which are considered
the best and most valuable prizes ever of
fered at any bundesfest. Armed and uni
formed guards will be on duty,at the en
trance to the glass palace day and night.
The riflemen detailed for that duty will
be assisted by four of the Pinnerton force,
while detectives in civilian attire will
watch over the safety of visitors and also
guard the approaches to the festival place
containing the palace of prizes.

Handicap. ) -
CHICAGO. July 6.â Robert Waddell. the
Derby horse, was left in the ruck to-day
in the Great Western handicap. Waddell
had up 122 pounds and was trying to give
a big pull In the weights to some of the
best Worses in the West. Advance Guard
was the betting favorite at 3 to 1, Robert
Waddell and Six Shooter at 4 to 1 each
and Terminus, Star Chamber and Vesu
vian 8 each, and the others were at longer
prices.
After several trials they got away to a
fair start. Vesuvian showed In front, with
the field close up. The pace was slow,
and coming down the stretch for the first
time Sidney Lucas got into the lead,
closely followed by Vesuvian, Six Shooter
and Robert Waddell in the order named.
On the turn, after passing the stand, Sid
ney Lueas dropped bacK beaten, and
Vesuvrkn and Six Shooter took up the
running. Robert Waddell was already In
difficulty, and on the backstretch It was
seen that he was beaten. ?
In the meantime Advance Guard moved
up and got third place. It was still a half
mile from home, and In view of Advance
Guard's unexcelled finishing qualities it
seemed a foregone conclusion he would
win. He held his place until the head of
the stretch. Here Vesuvian and Six
Shotter had shot their bolt, and Advance
Guard took command. The race was over
as far as first place was concerned. Ter
minus came along and made a bold bid,
but it was a futile effort to catch Advance
Guard, who won by two lengths from Ter
minus, who beat Star Chamber a length.
Robert Waddell came in sixth, fighting
hard but completely exhausted. Summary:
First race, five furlongsâ Rossfame won,
MeChesney second, L ssamuelson third. Time,

NEW YORK, July 6. â James R. Keene's

the deadlock would be shattered. Then
"'King" Kelly absorbed one of those far
away grounders and made out of Josh
Reilly the third dead, Pabst looking glum
and Indigo blue on the third sack.
The ninth did nothing but clear the way
for a string of good local batters for the
following inning. Hildebrand wisely and
â¢well allowed the ball to scrape his abdo
men In the tenth and was soon ornament-
Ing the first sack. Pabst came to' the
plate and by a pretty and hard hit to the
right fleld fence made a couple of bases,
but so remarkable was BrockhofTs throw
to the plate that Hildebrand was forced
to hug third. But Hildy scored soon aft
er. Krug hit to Reitz and on this out
Hildy treaded the rubber and the game
was over. Score:

The Americans thus got everything for
which they competed with the exception
of the quarter mile run. No records wera
touched in the other events of the day.
In the preliminary heats of the 100-yard
da3h A. F. Duffy of Georgetown Univer
sity won the first heat. Time 10 1-5 sec
onds. In another heat of this event W.
B. Tewksbury cf the University of Penn
sylvania finished third. Time 10 seconds.
The final heat was won by Duffy by three
yards. Time 10 seconds.
In the 120-yari hurdle race A. C. Kraenz
leln of the Chicago Athletic Club won.
Traffordf of Birmingham second. TimÂ©
15 3-5 seconds.
The 22C-yard hurdles proved another
safe thing. Kraenzleln led all the way
and won by four and a half yards in tuna
equaling his own record. Baxter of Penn
sylvania started, but was outpaced ami
stopped at the sixth hurdle.
In the pole Jump Irving K. Baxter of
the University of Pennsylvania tied at
nine feet ten inches. .
In the preliminary heats of thÂ© quarter
mile run Maxwell W. Long of the New
York Athletic Club won the first heat In
:57 2-5. In the final heat of the quarter
mile run Wadsley of the Unity Athletlo
Club beat Long by two yards. Time,
:49 4-5 seconds. ''
The heats of the long jumps and thÂ«
quarter mile run were carried out slmul*
taneously. In the former event the Irish
champion, O'Connor, had a walk over, A.
C. Kraenzleln of the Chicago Atbietlo
Club not competing, owing to the fact
that he had strained one of his thighs
while contesgnsr in the hurdles.
Irving K. Baxter of the University oC
Pennsylvania won the high jump and tied
Hodgson in the pole vault. In the latter
event Baxter was heavily handicapped by
having to use an unwieldy pole. His Eng
lish competitor somewhat churlishly re

Lennox has taken the money to Los An
geles. He lives a mile and a half from
the city, in a suburban district. t
The story is that when she was 25 year*
old Miss Lennox fell heir to a large sum
of money. She never banked it. but took
it always with her, burying it from place
to place.
"What took place at the interview no one
knows, but at i o'clock this morning the
brother commenced digging with an ax at
the foot of the central post of three in the
back fence of the cottage. The ax prov
ing inadequate, he obtained a pick and
shovel from a neighbor, who went with
him to the yard. At 4 o'clock the pick*
struck metal, and soon a rusted yeast
powder can was unearthed. In it were
gold coins, some of them many years old.
Another and yet other cans were dug up.
The find was one of .thousands of dollars.
John Lennox, a' Los Angeles man, is iho
luro of the story. He is at least the pres
ent owner of a sister's hoarded gold. For
four years prior to the night of July 4
Mi?s Mary Lennox lived in a tiny cottage
on the avenue. It was a place that stood
well apart from other houses. The woman
was a wanderer on the face of the earth,
and reputed to be a great traveler. She
had. lived everywhere, she taid. She had
not lived on the avenue long before her
neighbors discovered curious things. Sha
never, under any circumstances, used a
light at night and she was subject to fitÂ»
of the most terrible agony.
The old lady was 60 years of age and
had no visible means of support. "Where
her money came from no one knew; yet
she was a rich woman. A few days be
fore the Fourth she became deathly sick
and her brother, John Lennox, was sent
for at midnight, as she seemed to ba
dying.
"Won't it be terrible if she dies with
out telling where her money is?" said
some one at the bedside.
At the word "money" the woman
aroused. Her nurse was sent home and
no one but the brother remained with her.
At that time she probably revealed her
secret. She died an hour later.

"It is not easy to over-estimate the in
fluence he has exerted In rectifying the
popular idea that the doctrine of evolution
necessarily tends to materialism, if not
.i theism. So far from this, he regarded
it as inculcating the highest Ideal of a
vorld-plan, and he staunchly maintained
r.ot only its compatibility with religious
belief, but that it offered a much higher
point of view than could be derived from
any of the orthodox doctrines, by elevat
ing nature into the realm of theological
thought and aspiration. This part of his
infiurnoe will be sadly missed In the pref
<-nt state of scientific thought. His death
brines heavy loss not only to the univer
sity but to the world of thought at large."
"It was he who first made the Univer
sity of California known to the outside
world as a school and center of science
on Uw western border of the continent,
ard -who kept It In view of the world of
science, almost alone, for many years.

â¢whose affection and esteem remained with
him through life.
Professor Eugene W. Hllgard said:
"The death of Dr. Joseph LÂ« Conte re

scientific men of the time; one whosa
â¢writings and modes of thought have in
fluenced the progress of science all over

for a medical career, he thus acquired the
foundations of the broad knowledge which
later made him equally at home in the

"And that was true. Professor Le Conte
had been connected with the university
ever 6lnce the early seventies, whenthe
California College was merged into the
university. He was the companion of the
strong and the shield of the weak. And
the man in the college, be he professor or

that he could always find shelter behind
the rugged strength of Joseph Le Conte.
"He was the one man, almost the only
man, of really world-wide fame at Berke

There are many men whose fame is more
than American. But, go where you would,
there were men who had heard of Joseph
Le Conte. In the Old World, in Aus

turned upon college affairs, some college
man would ask your college, and if you
announced that you were from the Uni

tainly say: 'Oh, yes; that is where Joseph
Le Conte teaches.' . . Â» .
"Professor Le Conte stamped his Indi

kindly to a human being, and never doing
injury to any of God's creatures, he was

REDWOOD CITY, July 6.â The Board
of Supervisors of San Mateo County will
probably at its next meeting pass a strict
ordinance regulating the running of auto
mobiles upon the county roads. . Super-
Visor Coleman of San Mateo, at a meeting:
of the board, said that the machines were
becoming so numerous and their operators
so reckless that driving along. the roads
was becoming a hazardous recreation. He
desired a limit to- the speed of an automo
bile on mountain roads so slow as to make
the ride unattractive.
After considerable discussion the" board
finally determined that the following reg
ulations should be Incorporated in an . or
dinance: Automobiles must be operated
only by those who possess a certificate
attesting their competency, the examina
tion to be made by a board of examiners
to ; be appointed; Â¦ on approaching a team
the automobile must turn to the side -of
the road and come to a stop, and no noise,
such as allowing ' steam..- to escape or
clanging of gongs, shall be permitted
while the team . Is passing. . A speed limit
of probably six miles an hour will be in
sisted upon.' Â¦ <- Â¦ â¢Â¦.â¢-Â¦ :
Taking it all In all, the outlook for the
automobllista In San Mateo County is not
encouraging. . - Â¦ .. ,

ROME, July 6.â The Pope has sent a let
ter to the superiors and generals of the
religious orders and institutions, con
demning 'the French legislation against
congregations.
The letter says his Holiness is much af
flicted at the g-ravity of the offenses com
mitted by some nations against the re
ligious orders and institutions. The church
has thus not only been deeply injnred in
Its rights, but Its power of action has
been impaired.
The Pope severely reproves the recent
enactment of these laws by a country to
ward which the Pope. has exhibited par
ticular solicitude, 'and his Holiness desires
to comfort these orders and Institutions
that are suffering from the hatred of oth
ers toward the church. He urges them
to redouble their ardor, faith, prayer and
good works, 'to imitate the examples of
the beioved founders of their orders and
to repeat with Christ the sublime words,
"Father, forgive them."
The letter concludes: . "Console your
selves In God. The Pope and the whole
Catholic world are with you." .

Palma for the Presidency.
"Is there any feeling of apprehension
in Cuba with regard to the intentions of
the United States?" he was asked.
"No, there Is no question about it," he
replied. "Cuba trusts implicitly in the
honor of the American people."
"What can you say as to the future
policy of Cuba?" '
"That cannot be answered," replied
General Gomez, "because no one can fore
see the future: but I believe that the at
titude of Cuba will be one of gratitude in
accordance with the obligations of Cuba
to the United States."
"Whom do you think will be the Presi
dent of the Cuban republic?"
"I do not know, but I hope that it will
be General Palma."
"No, no," said General Palma; "that i3
for the Cuban people to 'say." â¢
"Well, there 'are three candidates," said
General Gomez, "or, rather, three persona
namedâ myself. General Bartolomeo Mas
so and -General Palma; I will not accept
under any circumstances. General Palma
was elected during the ten years' war and
I hope that he will be elected again."
After the dinner General Gomez said to
the newspaper men that he wished to ex
press his gratitude to the press of the
United States and of the world for the
great good they had done to the cause of
Cuba Ubre. He said that when he came
here years ago he was very sad, but that
on this visit he was very happy, and was
glad to recognize how much the American
people had done for the Cubans. He felt
a bond of sympathy with the American
nation when he first mingled with its peo
ple, but he now felt much more strongly
the reality of that bond. He was sure that
the Cubans were now established in their
own government, and would show, the
gratitude they feel for the help of the
Americans in removing the Spanish yoke.
Cuba and the United States, said the
general, belong together. It Is only a
question of gravitation when they will be
one. But at present, after the great strug
gle in which hundreds of thousands of
lives were sacrificed and when men re
turned to their homes only to find their
Ivives and children starved to death in
the restricted barriers in which Weyler
held them under his* policy of reconcen
tration. they felt that they must have
Cuba libre. It is realized fully. He said
that Cuba cannot get along without the
United States, but the Cubans want to
feel freedom. .

NEwfYORKrJuly 6.â W. E. Stokes gave
a dinner at the Union League Club to
night'to'General Maximo Gomez and Gen
eral Estrada Palma. â¢ Stokes was formerly
a member of the Cuban League of-Amer
ica and was olosely Identified ; with the
work of the junta of which Geneial Palma
was the head.' The' dinner was arranged
on the spur of 'the -moment. Â¦ General
Gomez intended to return to Cuba to-day,
and decided to remain until the morning
when he accepted Stokes' Invitation, and
the guests were summoned by telegraph.
The Cuban general was the hero. of the
occasion/ and was -warmly received. He
made a brief speech, which -was Inter
preted by General Gonzales.
General Gomez said he was almost
touched to tears by the remarkable recep
tion he had received in the United States.
He knew Cuba was indebted to the United
States,' but he never knew, until he came
here how deep that debt wasâ that it was
not merely the obligation of one country
to another, but of brother to brother.
Every Cuban born and bred, he said,
lived and died with the idea of Cuba libre
before him, with the hope of the people
being free and relieved of the yoke of op
pression. ,

"Work in Various Fields.
It has been known for some time that the
Standard was the only company with wiiich
there was a possibility of making a direct sale
of the local product, and the withdrawal of
that company from the negotiations leaves but
one possibility, that of uniting the product In
the hands of a single concern for its sale on
commission.
The Producers' Association has before it two
propositions, one from the Union Oil Com
pany, and the other from the Oil Storage and
Transportation Company, and President Allen
of the association said yesterday that . It was
thought by the committee of the association
-that' the proposition made by the Storage com
pany is the better one. It is understood that
at the meeting of the association a report will
be submitted by the entire committee recom
mending that the proposition of - the Storage
company be accepted. It Is believed that the
practical cessation of drilling In Los Angeles
has already cut the production below the local
consumption, and that with the producers or
ganized to handle the output on a uniform
price there is every reason to expect an* ad
vance In the market price.
pany to handle the product of the Los
Angeles Oil Producers' Association has
led to more serious consideration of a
proposition made by the Oil Storage Com
pany. There is an interesting rumor in
Los Angeles that the Standard and Stor
age companies have entered into an agree
ment whereby the local company is assur
ed of protection against competition with
Kern River oil. "The Standard Oil throws
up the sponge," says the Los Angeles
Times, in announcing the decision of the
great corporation. The Los Angeles Her
ald says that the Producers' Association
plans to have Its oil sol4 on commission
by the Storage Company. The particulars
given by the last named newspaper are as
follows:
The project to sell the oil went up In smoke
when a letter was received from Mr. Miller,
the agent of the Standard Oil Company at San
Francisco. For some time the committee of
the Producers' Association had been negotiat
ing with the Standard company, and it was
thought that an agreement was about to be
reached on the basis of the Standard taking
the entire product of the members of the as
sociation on a five years' contract at 65 cents.
Time- was taken to submit the proposition to
headquarters in New York, and the, reply came
back Tuesday that It was found that it would
require a number of months to put in sufficient
storage tanks to meet the requirements of the
local field, and It was therefore necessary" for
the Standard to withdraw from negotiations to
handle the Los Angeles oil on any basis,.
The oil locators are still busy in widely
separated portions of the State. The Fern
dale Enterprise tells of the location of a
group of claims in the Squaw Creek region
of the Mattole district in Humboldt
County, to be known as the Ruby, Sum
mit. Oak and General Grant, which to
gether embrace 480 acres.
Articles of incorporation of an oil com
pany capitalized at the extremely modest
figure of $24,000, the stock being divided
Into 240 shares of $100 each, have been filed
at Eureka to operate the Humboldt well
In the Mattole district. The incorporators
are S. M. Buck, J. F. Coonan and T. W.
Hine of Eureka; William I. Hamilton of
Fond du Lac Wis.. and Herbert Hamilton
of Arizona.
On the desert, at Victor, according to the
San Bernardino Free Press, oil has been
struck. The tools drilling In a well were,
according to the report received at San
Ben-ardino. shot up 100 feet and traces of
oil followed in the water that came up.
In the meantime the hopes of the people
at Carbondale, in Amador County, have
been dashed. Land was bonded some time
ago on the strength of oil indications. The
excitement extended to Jackson Valley
and several farmers were offered liberal
prices for their holdings. An expert has
Einee then made an adverse report. The
Carbondale Company has thereupon dis
banded, after a somewhat stormy discus-
Elon over the expert's opinion.
The refusal of the Standard Oil Com-
ing downi The excitement has about died
out and business is taking its place."

The Hanford Journal says of the
Coalinga district that more work is being
done in the territory of the Confidence

The. banquet that was recently tendered
to Mrs. Genevleve Baker," grand president,
by her parlor, Buen_a Vista, was planned
to be only for the members and officers

fice in the order how. much she was
thought of. It was for that reason that
no other grand officers or other members
of the order were, present. The affair

STOCK MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 6.â The opening in the wheat
market was fairly steady, but this feeling soon
gave way to the bear influences and there was
a general decline. Elevator Interests were the
principal sellers and commission houses
bought, but the buying by the latter was not
sufficient to sustain the market. The grading
of the new wheat Is almost perfect and was
also a bear factor. . September opened %c to
%@%c lower at 66c to 66ti@<66Vic. On local
Belling the price dropped to 65%c. Weakness
prevailed throughout the day and the close
wan IVic lower at 65%@65%c,
There was a moderate activity In corn, with
a gtnerally easy tone. -Weather influences
were the causes for- the weakness exhibited
shortly after the opening, and considerable
long stuff came on the market. A slight rally
took place, but weakness prevailed throughout
the remainder of the session. September closed
%ff?HrC lower at 47%c to 47V4c
Trading in oats was active from the start
and there were .enough ready buyers to keep
the feeling etrong. Bad crop news continued to
be the main bull feature.. September closed
>>SÂ»ic higher at 2Â»Hff29Uc. -
Provieions opened higher and the market
was moderately active. Receipts of hogs were
below expectations. September pork closed 25c

v hole Is good. While much depends upon the
Frowlnsr crops of corn and hay, etockmen are
not looking: for any advance In stockers and
feÂ«?dÂ«rs, but they do anticipate a steady mar
ket at about last year's figures. Should the
corn crop be unusually large these prices will
b* much firmer, but 6hould it fall short they
will expect to take something off the present
trices.
Weather Report.
A feature of the Western range situation has
been the large demand for pure bred and high
rrade bulls and rams. This demand seems to
be satisfactorily Increasing, and as the West
ern rene* man usually desires this class of
nnimals In carload lots and prefers them al
ready acclimated. H may be said that the de
mand U coming principally from ranchmen
v.ho are putting in pure bred herds for the
purpose of breeding the etock needed on the
ranch. This accounts for the unusual demand
for female stock. The Western range breeder
realizes thoroughly now that he must breed
a first-class jcrade of beef cattle end mutton ia
ortcr to compete with the Email ranchman,
and plcns are being made to accommodate this
Semajid on a liberal scale.
The outlook for the livestock business on the
The (sheep situation Is not so satisfactory.
Reports all indicate a general expectation of
lower prices, due to the crowded condition of
the ranee6 and the absolute necessity of re
ducing the flock* to fit the range conditions.
The lamb crop has been unusually heavy, ow
ing to the mild winter and favorable Weather
â¢t lambing time. The movement from tfae
range to market will commence earlier than
usual en both cattle and sheep and a heavy
rt:n of sheep and an average run of cattle Is
expected.
Cattlemen expect to market a larcrer per
cent of their cattle as beef than usual, owing
to the (food feed that has prevailed In nearly
all sections. Ov.inr to the generally favorable
conditiors of the beef market, range prices
are holding steady and cattlemen are looking
for steady prices in the fall at about an aver
ace v.-lth last year. TSe strong- demand on
tlie Pacific Coast for all kinds of stock has
diverted many cattle In that direction that
usually come East. The movement In this
direction will continue this fall and is caused
hy the Increased home an<l Asiatic demand
for meats. This Is particularly true of Neva
da, Utah, Idaho, Arizona and Western Wyo
ir.tni:. Quite a number of Montana cattle,
mostly fat stuff, have also gone West instead
of East to market, and more will eo in the
fall. The movement of horses Is unusually
large owing to the general remunerative prices
jrevailing in the East, and the ranges are be
ing cleaned uo of many bands which only a
few years ago were considered worthless and
a nuisance. ' 'â¢
The situation In the corn States of the Mis
rispippi and Missouri valleys is too uncertain
Et this time to enable a prediction as to the
feeder fiemand in the fall. According to re
ports received at this office, the number of
cattle on summer feed is very much lighter
than usual an i the markets will be com
pelled to depend to a certain extent upon
prass cattle. There are an unusual number of
?attle on pasture in Kansas and Nebraska
and prass conditions are reported to be very
pood In most sections, although the late warm
wave has threatened the situation somewhat.
Semi-annual reports received by the secre
tary of the National Livestock Association
from all "Western States and Territories re
rardlng- conditions of the livestock Industry
cn the ranee indicate a most properous year
for the industry as a whole. The winter losses
â¢were lighter than for many years, but heavy
Fprlng- storms In some sections caused about
the usual eprlns: losses, but the average will
not reach over three per cent. Many sections
report losses from predatory wild animals
greater than usual, showing that this pest
must soon be met In some way. Another cause
of loirs has been thieves, who have been un
usually bold and successful during the last
few months, ewecially on the horse ranches.
Reports from ronnd-ups show an average
above the usual calf crop. At the present time
the only sections threatened with drought are
Southern and Eastern New Mexico and South
ern Arizona. There is still time, however, for
rummer rains to relieve these conditions. The
northern lialf of Montana and Western North
and Soutn Dakota suffered frorrt a late spring
and flrcught, but thÂ«=se conditions have lately
been relieved and tht range feed, though late,
was never better. There has been a large
movement of stock cattle from the Southwest
era to Northern ranees, approximating: 150. â¢
O00 heafl. The movement of Western cattle
has been much lighter than usual, being prin
cipally from Pacific Coast States to Montana
and Wyoming. Many sections report the range
badly crowded and early in the EDrine there
were many clashes between sheep and cattle
owners for possession of the range, but the good
rains ar.d consequent Improvement of the feed
on the ranpe has temporarily relieved this Vcn
dltion. Prospe-ts are considered good for a heavy
movement of Western range grass cattle com
mencing' about a month earlier than usual and
probably continuine late into the fall. Prices
in stock cattle have been from Jl 50 to $2 50
per head lower than last year. Strictly high
grade cattle are steady with a year ago and in
demand.

Livestock Conditions.
The Lonaon Grocers' Gazette of June 22
ears: Calif ornla fruits continue to move off
slowly, and prices may be Quoted as generally
unchanged. The question of the duty on tinned
apricots enfl apricot pulp was raised In the
House of Commons, when in reply to ques
tion* by Mr. X. E. Kearley. the Chancellor of
the Exchequer said that canned apricots were
eubject to duty on fruit, and on being asked
to define the difference between a peach and
an aDricot he said: "The decision dates for
many year* back, when it was decided that
an apricot was a plum and a. peach was not!"
Subsequently, however, the Chancellor said
tfcat he wi considering whether a lower rate
of duty might not properly be charged on pre
eerved than on dried apricots, eo that the
trade are hoping that tinned apricots may yet
be relieved from the excessive rate of duty.

The Building Review makes a summary
of , the building operations In the city for
six-month periods during a number of
years. The $4,000,000 mark has been
touched only four times since 1884. In 1S&
the total value of buildings erected in the
first six months was $4,267,375; in 1890, $5.
576,007; in 1891. $4,576,070. The month of
June, 1901, leads June, 1890 by a slight
margin, the buildings of the first men
tioned month representing a value of $1,
057,776. as against $1,021,218 in June, 1900.
On June 30. 1901, the deposits in the sav
ings banks of San Francisco amounted to
J135,26J,308. The money loaned by. the
banks' on real .estate amounted to $64,121,
360, or. 47 per cent of the deposits. Twenty
years ago. 75 per cent of the deposits was
loaned", on real- estate. The. mortgages
for the first six months of the year in San
Francisco amounted to $11,256,104. ; The re
leases ' of the - same - period - were - In total
Progress of Building.
The â¢ remainder of the year. wltlT>the
costly and large buildings already planned
and the many others yet to be arranged
for will add enough to the showing of
the first of the present year to break the
record for 1S9L
' The ' sales ' of realty In the first jj 3lx
months of 1901 aggregated -2223 in number
and ;. $14,516,988 in value, as against 1783
sale's representing $10,890,563 for the first
half of 1900, and 1566 Bales representing
$7,289,624 , for the first six months of 1899.
Thomas. Magee & Sons in their real estate
circular- write that uniesa the existing
strikes last long, the city, real estate sales
of the last half of the year will consider
ably ' exceed thosa of the first half.
Altogether the outlook for the year Is
excellent. . '..-...
I The statistical review of buildings erect
ed and of sales of realty effected* during
the first half of the present year affords
a fair and unimpeachable basis for esti
mating 1 the advancement of San Fran
cisco. The building statistics for the six
months show a total of 763 structures, of
which the aggregate Value is $4,090,955.
This Is the best record since 1S91 in num
ber of Improvements and also in total

The proposition to establish a weekly
labor organ does not agree with the opin
ions of a majority of the members of
Carpenters' Union No. 22. which at Its
last meeting adopted a series of resolu
tions, concluding as follows:
Â¦Resolved. That we pledge our hearty support
to Organized Labor <the present publication)
anfl commend Its efficient management and the
untiring zeal of Us able editor. O. A. Tveit
rnoe; and. be it further
Resolved. That we deplore the action taken
by the email sister union, and although we do
not wish to criticize its members generally,
still we are firm In our belief that among the
members of this yo'ing sister organization
there were two or three who, by reason of petty
envy and unmanly jealously of more able men.
succeeded In poisoning the minds of the re
mainder, who. through prejudice or 'indiffer
ence,, totally forgot their obligation as union
xnes and their duty as men to the cause of
organized labor.
Millmen's Union No. 423 has elected and
Installed the following named officers:
Several representatives of the various j
local unions met last night at 927 Market I
street and discussed the details of the !
formation of a "united labor party." The j
meeting was executive and the chair- '
man at Its close announced that the plans )
filxthâ Where extraordinary precautions are
required, either of the following solutions may
be used to advantage for antiseptic purposes:
\ 1â Alcohol (pure), 05 per cent proof.
2â Lysol (L.. & F.). 2 per cent solution. â¢
3â Pyrozone (McK. & R-). one part to eight
parts of boiled water.
4â Hydrogen dioxide (Oakland), one part to
eight parts of boiled water.
fcâ Bensolyptus (Schiefflln), one part to six
parts of boiled water.
Seventh â The use of a sponge for public use
Is hereby prohibited.
Eighthâ For disinfecting cuspidors or other
vessels. Plan's Chlorides are recommended as
eafe and efficacious in the proportion of one to
eight, parts of water, but they should first be
cleansed dally by flushing them under a hy
drant or hose.
r Ninthâ Pulvola. being an lmpalable and anti
septic powder, could be used with advantage on
an Irritable -skin in place of the cheap talcum
powder now in use.
.Tenth â The barber should wash his hands In
running water before handling each customer.
After stropping the razor it should be wiped
vlth gauze or cotton wet with alcohol before
putting it on a man's face.
Eleventhâ Hair brushes can be thoroughly
sterilised by baking for a few moments after
ore In a small tin oven 4x10 inches, and should
be washed thoroughlv with strong soap under
hot running water every day.
Twelltbâ Sea sponges should be discarded and
replaced by a clean towel or surgeon's gauze, j
<costlng only 15 cents for five yaitls). It !s ab- j
eolutely necessary that clean unused towels be i
used on each custorcer. j
Cautionâ When usiap water to cleanse with I
It should be runnln; water.
A card containing these rules, -when
finally adopted, must be placed in each
shop. Under section 14 of Its act creating- I
the State Board of Barber Examiners j
power is vested in the officers of the Stale
and Municipal Boards of Health to ex
amine into the sanitary conditions of ail
barber shops and provide rules and regu
lations for their proper conduct.
The certificate of registration, a very
handwrnely engraved document. Is now
ready, and will be sent out on Monday. It
is printed on heavy vellum. At each side
of the seal of the State, in the center, is
a barber pole, executed In the colors of
the profession.
Chairman Goff and Secretary Ed Rosen
bÂ«Tg of the San Francisco Labor Council j
vif-ited a larere number of jobbing- butchers
yesterday and discussed the .situation rc
parding the ultimatum of the butchers.
They were well received, but no -denntto
results were reached. A report will b *. \
made to the executive committee as soon i
as sufficient data are gathered. -
. Ab a result of the investigations of the
local barber "colleges" made on Friday
afternoon by State Barber Examiner Ca
lisn a series of sanitary rules has been
proposed. Examiners Calish and Drake
called upon Dr. Williamson, president of
the Board of Health, and submitted the
proposed rules to him for examination. As
Beveral of the States where the barbers
hiÂ«V6 boards of examiners have already
adopted similar rules, the same will be ef
fectively placed in force In this city. These
rules will be embraced, on the recom
mendation of the Board of Health, in an
ordinance to be submitted to the Board
of Supervisors, and an infraction of them
irtxl be made a misdemeanor. The sug
f.estions presented are as follows:
Firstâ Absolute cleanliness in every detail of
â¢work and environment Is the underlying princi
ple of tonsorial sanitation.
Secondâ The methods of enforcing the above
principles should be simple, safe, effectual and
convenient in application.
Thirdâ For cleansing purposes usually strong
soap and hot water will meet most of the re
quirements.
Fourth â Towels and linen should be thorough
ly boiled when laundered and kept In places
secure from dust and other impurities and fre- 1
cuent handling. Brushes, combs, shaving cups. |
razors and soap should be kept in clean glass
cases, aiid never used without being thoroughly
cleansed with soap and hot running water, the
brushes afterward dipped In 95 per cent alcohol
If desired. .
Fifthâ In shaving or cutting the hair of cus
tomers who -have eruptions of the scalp or face,
particular attention should be paid to cleans
ing everything used on them, with due refer
ence to antisepsis. In thesse cases sponges,
brushes or combs should be thoroughly boiled
or disinfected with a 5 per cent solution of car
bolic acid before being used again. The razor
can be made safe by washing In running water
with soap and wiped with gauze wet with al
cohol.
