ONE SPECIAL MAKES A
A number of the specials attacked yes
terday were ex-soldiers.' They were treat
ed as the other specials until they brought
their six-shooters to bear In the direction
of the rock batteries. There was no
necessity for the sounding of a "cease
firing" call. '
Nearly every fusillade of stones was fol
lowed by a gun play on the part of the
specials. The gun play generally resulted
in. the slinking to cover of the attacking
party and the frightened, huddling to
gether of the crowd of onlookers and sym
pathizers, who were apparently too mucn
fascinated by the- open display of law
lessness to seek safety in retirement. from
the scene. of violence. Â¦ .
of them owe their lives to a lucky duck

by. a gang of strikers yesterday forenoon

was taken to the Emergency Hospital,

a cut on his scalp. In addition to this he
had several contused wounds about the

The [ close of the baseball game ""at the
THE flame of resentment,, smol
dering since the commencement
of the present labor troubles,
j against the employment' of po
lice-protected non-union team
sters, burst into a blaze yester
day afternoon and for three hours the
pent-up passions of ' the strikers were
given free play. For three hours one^of
the most thickly populated sections of the
city was virtually in the hands of a mob.
The police were comparatively' helpless.
Guns were displayed with the legendary
freedom of the wild frontier times, 'shots
were fired and bullets and rocks ricochet
ed hither and thither with alarming fre
quency and In every direction. .' [
The leaders in this outburst from the
lestraint of weeks .were- for the most
part striking teamsters. -The active par
ticipants in the attack _ or series 'of at
tacks on , special officers and non-union
teamsters numbered' about 500." This
number was augmented . by a crowd of
over 5000 spectators apparently more or
less in sympathy with the excited strik
ers.
The restraints placed upon the men- by
their leaders in the strike movement
were entirely forgotten for the while.
Women and children huddled in the
shelter of -â¢ doorways fearful for their
lives, and tradesmen watching the
rising and, falling of the mob's fighting
temperature heaved sighs of relief when'
the police managed finally to clear the
streets.
Twelve or 'fifteen shots were fired, but,
as far as could be learned last night,
wlth'out fatality. Forty .or fifty times
during the three hours pistols were dis
played, and only the fact of ! ' the display
serving" the purpose and making the mob
cease its bombardment of rocks 6aved the
firing of many more shots and a large
sacrifice of life.
The trouble started soon after 4 o'clock.
The police did not reach . the : scene until
some time after, and it was not :. until
yearly 7 o'clock that the officers were
able to make a clean sweep of the crowd
and leave the district in its normal quiet;

cape.
Ashcroft followed more leisurely; hold
ing the crowd at bay with . his revolver.
He had occasion to fire once more, when
near Market street, and during the halt
of his pursuers, which followed the shot,
he .was' able ; to reach the two policemen
wher later escorted him safely to the Hall
of Justice.
. McLaughlin, the driver, stampeded by
the. mob, tore along. Sixth street with a
horde of infuriated strikers at his heels.
There was not a policeman in sight, but
an open-door at No. 103 looked g. promis

.Under ordinary circumstances the refuge

proved a lucky choice. In '.the darkness
it was impossible _. to distinguish friend

LONDON, Aug. Â£S.â A dispatch from
Lord Kitchener dated Pretoria, August 25,
says:
EIGHT non-union men.~thres of
whom were ex-soldiers,- were at
tacked by a "crowd of men sup
posed to ' be members of the
unions out on strike, at the cor-
ner of Steuart and Market
streets shortly after 11 o'clock last night,
and but for the presence of police officers
in the immediate vicinity they would
have been badly beaten if not killed. As
it was three of them had to go to the
Harbor Hospital to have their wounds
dressed.
The men who were attacked are em
ployed at the transport dock loading flour
on one of the transports. They were be
hind in the work and were kept over
time. They quit work at 10 p. m., and
knowing that it was dangerous to walk
the front alone they left the dock to
gether.
They were not molested as they pro
ceeded along East street, though there
were a number of strikers standing or
sitting in the doorways. The eight men
walked at a rapid gait and did not feel
safe until after they had turned into Mar
ket street.
Once on that thoroughfare they felt
that they were free from danger of at
tack, and in consequence were not pre
pared for the rush that met them as they
started to cross Steuart street.'
â¢ t
The non-union men were surrounded in
a moment by fully fifty men, who darted
from the darkness of Steuart street, and
without uttering a cry. even of derision,
started to hammer them* unmercifully.
The employes of the Government fought
back as best they could, but the number
against them was too great. . They
managed to stay together for a time,
and thus saved themselves- from being
knocked down and trampled. upon. - Blows
were showered upon them from every di
rection, but most of them landed upon
their shoulders and arms.
The attacking party, had carefully plan
ned the attack, for it made no noise.
There was no yelling or shouting from
the attackers, and the men who were at
tacked were too busy warding off the
blows to think of yelling for help. '
The crowd surged backward and for
ward on the street, and It was not until
the unequal contest had been In progress
for several minutes that the strikers suc
ceeded in separating the crowd of eight.
Five of the men who were assaulted
broke away from their comrades, and by
punching, kicking and shoving right and':
left got through the crowd and dashed
up Market street. The three who were
left behind were having a hard time of
It when Policemen Edna and McGowan
reached them.
The sight of the regular officers run
ning swiftly, armed wit"h their wicked
looking riot clubs, frightened the mob, for
the men started to run and In a very few
moments there was not one but .the three
non-union men and the officers left at
Steuart and Market streets. The patrol
wagon was . summoned and the injured
men, escorted by the officers, were taken
to the hospital, where their wounds,

marched forward and received the trophy
at the hands of thirty of the fairest young

there was an added heartiness in the
cheers given to the Callfornians of both

judging by the comments heard in

night. In the face of most vexatious ob
stacles andiagainst the finest drill corps
of the United States it carred off the thl.U
prize and received the trophy, a magnifi
cent center, piece valued -. at , $1300. The
scenes at' the drill and the award of the
prizes were spirited and brilliant in spite
of the heat that wilted â¢ marchers and
spectators alike. . California Commandery
is also sharing in the joy, having won the
fifth prize, a punch bowl, awarded to the
best mounted commandery.
The drill contests were held on Churchill
Downs, on the Louisville Jockey Club
track. No better parade, ground could
have been selected. The various com
manderies participating were supported
by scores of home friends, while. the gen
eral crowd numbered many thousands.
Golden Gate was the last infantry corps
to drill, having been preceded by the crack
St. Bernard Commandery of Chicago. Col
orado Commandery of Denver, which cap
tured first prize, performed Its evolutions
with marvelous precision. The indications
pointed to victory on the part of the St.
Bernards, but their commander omltleu
three orders, which took off thirty points.
Golden Gate was hampered by heavy
capes and chapeaux, the rule having been
made that all corps should drill in full
uniform. As Golden Gate had never be
fore drilled in capes and chapeaux its suc
cess is all the more gratifying.
The headquarters of Colorado, Golden
Gate and California commanderies, all at
the Gait House, were thronged until long
after midnlcht..
The most, striking spectacle of the day's
drill,' In the eyes cf the crowd, i was ' the
mounted drill of California Commandery.
With glittering accouterments and
lances the plumed knights swept down on
coal-black Kentucky chargers and quite
caDtured the fancy of the spectators. The
prize, while fifth in the order anncmnced.
ls really a first prize, as there was no

SACRAMENTO. Aug. 28.â The war
which has raged between J. T>. Tate and
F.^W. Fratt, both equally elderly citizens
of "Sacramento and both such extensive
property owners that it would be some
trouble to count their possessions, has
been given a new Impetus by a complaint
filed by Tate to-day. It charges Fratt
with defamation . of character, and asks
the court to award the plaintiff $20,070
damages. ' Â¦ '
A few weeks ago Fratt had Tate ar
rested for having, aa alleged, maliciously
torn down a~ fence forming the division
line between two lots which they own up
town. The case was fought with vigor
on both sides, but the jury acquitted Tate
of the charge. The glad hand of reconcili
ation was not passed, however, and Tato
determined that ft was up to him to make
a move. This he has done in the case filed
to-day, in which he particularizes that in
assailing his reputation by having him
arrested without due cause Fratt has
made himself liable to the extent of $20,
000. Besides this, Tate would like to havo
the court decree that Fratt should pay
$70 to cover the cost of Tate's appearance
as a defendant In the lower court.

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 28.â The down
river community of Freeport. the scene
of the annual Holy Ghost festivals and
the seat of a deeply religious sentiment by
Portuguese, is greatly, exercised over tha
case of a girl named Maria Careia. Up
to three weeks ago Maria, who 13 17 years
old, .was apparently in. perfect health.
Thereafter and up to the present she
has undergone periods of a remarkabla
frenzy; during which her language, utter
ed In strange tones, has borne out tha
idea that she was possessed of the spirit
of a murderer, who was himself slain in
Portugal twenty years ago by the brother
of his victim and whose spirit, like that
of Hamlet's father, was "doomed to walk
. the earth" for a certain period. The girl,
while in this state, avers that the spirit's
time will be up in a few months, when it
will leave her in peace again. She emerges
smiling from these grewsome spells and
is happy and rational, with no recollec-*
tion of her strange ordeal.
The attacks have been quite numerous
during the past three weeks, and the re
cital which she gives each time does not
vary in any essential. Her relatives ara
utterly at a loss to account for her re
markable behavior, and even the medical
diagnosis of hysteria will not satisfy tha
Portuguese community that the supernat
ural does not figure in her case. â
In the Bee to-night Joseph Rodgers, for

Special ZMspatch to The Can.
TACOMA. Aug. 28.â The fire which Is
burning In the Cumberland coal mines on
the west coast of Vancouver Island proves
to be a worse calamity than has been sup
posed heretofore. Mining experts esti
mate it will be at least two ytars before
the fire can be fully extinguished and the
mine cleaned out and again' placed In
complete working order.
The conflagration broke out several
weeks ago In the underground workings
to tha right of the main shaft, and is be
lieved to have been started by a small
gas explosion in some unused drifts. John
Nichol and two Chinese were in that por
tion of the mine at the time. Nichol was
an electrician and had gone there to
superintend the taking up of some copper
wires that were no longer needed in that
part of the mine. No trace of the three
has since been found. They perished
by either the explosion or â¢ the fire that
followed. . Â¦.--.âÂ¦ i Â¦-.
When first noticed by workmen below,
the fire was - consuming the oily shales
and assuming proportions that threatened
to quickly destroy the mine. The miners
hurried out and arrangements were made
to flood the entire workings. For several
days. past 3000 gallons of water have been
poured into the burning mine every min
ute. Even at this rate it will take nearly
a month to fill the mine and extinguish
the flre. Immense pumps must then be
placed In operation and the water slowly
pumped out.

cians who to-day committed him to the

lif-ved that when he had outlived the re
sults of recent debauchery he would be
aJl right. He did not Improve and it was
to-day decided that he would fare better
at the asylum.
Roberts Is a typical Englishman, about
six feet three Inches in height and of
rather slender build. He is about 30 years
of. age, and, were it not for the rather
foolish appearance his face at times as

which has grown during his confinement,
is brown, while his hair is of flaxen color.
His features are patrician and his hands
and feet are small and well shaped. Alto
gether he is, apart from his clothing, the
most aristocratic looking tramp ever
picked up on the Santa Clara County road.
Â¦Roberts claims to be a nephew of Lord
Roberts and says that his sister Is Mrs.

was stationed at Malta, in the Mediter

are held outside the entrance to the dock
awaiting a chance to unload. "
At the Howard-street dock the Palena

Is, no knowledge In a legal sense. Mr. Foote
very frankly announced yesterday that It had
been his Intention at the time of the Imposi
tion of sentence herein to suggest that- the
court deal very leniently, with this defendant,
that he was deterred from pursuing that course
and led to pursue the very contrary course,
namely, that of urging upon the court the
necessity and the importance of inflicting . a
very severe jjunishment, by reason of facts or
alleged facts, subsequently transpiring. My
attention was drawn by him to the fact, as
stated, that the purpose of punishment. Is
two fold: First, to inflict punishment upon
an offender and next to take into view the
likelihood of thereby deterring . other persons
from offending. That is true. Â¦ but to apply the
rule suggested yesterday by Mr. Foote, namely,
to bold a man found guilty for committing an
offense at one time responsible for something
eald or done, or alleged to have been said > or
done, subsequently by another person would
savor, It eemes to me, in" spirit and- essence
at least, if not otherwise, of an ex post facto
proceeding. It would seem to make a def end-
The contention put forth here that an offi
cer is vested with what has been termed by
his counsel "Judicial power" or "discretion"â
"judicial discretion," I cannot indorse. I
think that h. police officer is essentially a
ministerial officer, and as such is vested by
the law with ministerial powers and with min
isterial powers only. : The very theory on
which our- government rests (and It runs
throughout all the various subdivisions of the
Federal Government) Is that this government
âwhether you consider it federally, with ref
erence to State government or with' reference
to local governmentâ is a government of co
ordinate powersâ the executive, legislative and
the judicialâ and that applies, as I have al
ready intimated. Just as much to the subdi
vision of a local government or a municipal
government, commonly so termed, as to any
other. Now. while I have eald this much,
it is but fair also to say that though a police
officer is never vested with Judicial authority
there are times when he must exercise a dis
cretion, a discretion which must be exercised
In order to enable him to determine Just what
course of action Is to be taken by him in
any emergency arising in the line of his min
isterial or executive duties, and as I Inti
mated when this matter was first decided it Is
but right In every case to consider all the sur
roundings, particularly where the case is that
of the exercise of undue power by an officer,
police, Eherlft or any other. Now I have care
fully considered It In that light, and on . the
other hand I cannot Â¦ but think that the line
of demarkatlon which defines the duties of a
police officer in a situation such as 'was pre
sented at the wharf Is quite clearly defined,
and having found that line overstepped I must
accordingly exercise my judgment.
I want to say. too, because it was particu
larly drawn to my attention yesterday by
Mr. Foote In his argument, that I cannot agree
with him altogether, at least In the view that
the punishment to be Imposed upon this de
fendant 1b to be fixed not alone with reference
to his own act but also ;. with - reference to
The court In this matter, as In all others, Is
desirous of Imposing a punishment which, In
view of all the circumstances and conditions
surrounding the transaction, will, according t-j
the court's view, meet the demands of justice,
and I have therefore given it careful considera
tionâconsidered it in every possible lightâ and
feel In . a measure that there some circum
stances which ought to be taken into considera
tion on each side.
When the case of Policeman O. H.
Knight, convicted of battery upon James

As Attorney Coffey was leaving- the

of Attorney W. W. Foote, who specially
prosacuted the case, said to Knight, tak
ing him by the hand. "My brother has
been prosecuting you, but I want to say
that my sympathies are entirely with you.
You should never have been convicted.
You are a martyr."
"In this Instance," said the Judge,
"owing to the fact that the District At

material facts in the case, not having
been actively engaged in its prosecution,
I would suggest, Mr. Lermen, that you

Attorney Coffey at once gave notice of

Nathan Walter was -well known among
business men in San Francisco. He was
formerly connected with the commission
branch of the Crown- Distilleries Com
pany, conducted by Lilienthal & Co, For
the' last two years he has been in busi
ness for., himself in the north, to which
section he has made two trips.
: The news. of his death was received by
his former business associates last even
ing and they were greatly shocked The
blow came particularly hard to his aged
and widowed mother.
Walter was 38 years old and a' bachelor
He was \ the only brother of Sanford
Walter, vice president of George Morrow
& Co. None of his friends or former
associates could, give a reason for his
suicide. The last time he was in thia.
city was about two years ago.- Last sea
son he came down from the north on the
last steamer, as he had done the pre
ceding season, but he stopped at Seattle
and returned to Nome without visiting
San Francisco. He was in good health.
If he met financial that fact is
nor admitted by his friends. Seemingly
he had much to live for.
SEATTLE. Aug. 28.â The body of Nathan
Walter, who committed suicide in Nome,
was brought down on the steamship Sen
ator, which arrived this morning. Walter
was well known in Seattle, having repre
sented Lllienthal & Co. of San Francisco
here for many years, buying hops. His
body is held awaiting advices from his
parents in San Francisco.
Special Pispatch to The Call.
Henry T. Scott said that he had no.
means of knowing how many of those
who joined the works areunion employes.
He was .told that all of them were old
employes and as a- large percentage of
the.. men. were machinists he supposed
they- were strikers. -".,.',
force of non-union hands at the

East. They were brought over from Point.
Richmond in a gasoline launch and taken
direct to the works, where they were
given quarters in the bunkhouse erected
for the convenience of the employes The
trip.was made in the early. hours of the
morning and" was accomplished without
the knowledge of the union pickets. A

NATHAN WALTER
DIES A SUICIDE
The arrival of the police under Lieuten
ants Anderson and Martin and Sergeant
Michael Joseph Conboy tended to reduce
the fighting temperature of the mob. But
tbat was all. The guardians of the peace
were outnumbered a hundred to one, and
while able to control the crowds in their
immediate proximity, such a thing as
clearing the streets was . so apparently
hopeless that it was not attempted.
Although the special policemen came in
for the lion's share of the bombardment,
opportunities to assault the regular police
were not overlooked. Lieutenant Ander
. son was struck twice, and the back of his
buggy bears silent testimony to the flight
<Jer. With the rapidity of chain lightning
he wheeled around and before another
rock was hurled was sitting, calm and
immovable as before, facing the attack
ing party, a revolver in each hand and
two alert eyes searching the crowd for a
sign of further hostilities. The sign was
never given.
The small boys did their share in keep
ing up the trouble. Throwing rocks at
"scabs'" was sport too rare to be over
looked, and they indulged to their heart's
content until the appearance on the scene
of Sergeant Conboy, who gave them a
series of heart-to-heart talks which had
the effect of restrictinz their activity to
gathering rocks, providing the strikers
with ammunition, hooting the unhappy
targets and cheering every bullseye.
Most of the rock throwing was done by
a crowd of husky young teamsters. In
the crowd which caused yesterday s dis
turbance the professional hoodlum was
conspicuous by his absence. It was an at
tack on the non-union teamsters and their
police guards bv striking teamsters, and
the latter made no secret either of their
identity or their determination to work all
the bodily harm in their power on the men
holding down the jobs vacated by the
strikers.
Percy Ashcroft, the special police offi
cer, was charged at the Central police
station with "exhibiting a deadly weapon
in a. rude manner." He was released on
bail. ...... . 1
"The throwing of cobblestones must
stop," Captain Wittman remarked last
night. "I do not object to the strikers
taking fair means to convert the non
union teamsters, but I will do everything
in my power to stop the practice of using
cobblestones to intimidate men who are
not affiliated with the unions. From
v?hat I have learned the strikers used
blank cartridges, expecting that the non
union men would become frightened and
desert their teams. Had they . used bul
lets many a disinterested person would
have been injured. I intend to take every
precaution to prevent a recurrence of to
day's troubles. Every policeman that can
be spared will be assigned to south of
Market Ptreet, with instructions to pro
tect the non-union teamsters ~at all haz
ards." â¢ â¢'Â¦ Â¦ Â¦Â¦
To avoid another attack by strikers on
non-union \ teamsters, Captain Wittman
intends to place an extra . guard of
police in the vicinity of last night's
trouble.
Policeman D. J. Driscoll was treated
at the Receiving Hospital about 7
o'clock for a badly sprained thumb. He
was one of the officers stationed at the
corner of Sixth and Harrison streets
during the heat of the melees, and In
endeavoring to force back the crowd
struck his thumb. He continued on duty
until, he was relieved with the rest of
the squad, i ' ' "
Police Officer Patrick Sullivan, while
beating back the mob, was struck on the
left arm by a cobblestone hurled by one
of the strikers. He. was forced to go to
a doctor's office, â¢, where the injured mem
ber was dressed.' â¢ Â¦ ' . â¢â¢.,Â¦Â¦-
As the officers detailed on Sixth street
were returning homeward in the direction
of Market street, they had another,, ad
venture which for a few moments threat
ened to assume serious proportions. ' An
Armenian' peddler named George Alexar
had a- small push ' cart laden with fruit
nesr the southwest, corner 'of Sixth and
Market streets. ; Some of .the boys who
had followed the policemen up the street,
expecting more trouble, began stealing
the man's fruit. ; He made a great outcry
and a crowd quickly gathered. â¢ *
The officers started^to drive, the crowd
off, but were met with a volley of stones.
One of these struck Officer W..J.. Cav
anaugh in the back, and two persons
who saw the stone thrown -and the of
ficer struck: pointed out William Irvine
a lad 16 years old living at 522 Steven
fon street, as the offender. He was ar
rested and charged with battery on an
officer. He claims to have been an in
nocent onlooker.*
In connection with the earlier troubles of
the evening: the police arrested the follow
ing strikers, charging them on the regis
ter of the Southern Station with drunken
ness: Thomas Me Ardle, aged 43, painter;
William Grimshaw, aged 36, boxmaker,
and Edward E. Case, aged 40, teamster. T.
F. Rafferty, aged 22, a teamster, was ar
rested about the same time at the corner
of Fourth and Harrison streets on the
same charge: *
Lieutenant Anderson was in a buggy at
the corner of Sixth and Folsom streets in
company with Sergeant Conboy. A dozen
or more mounted officers were stationed
at Sixth and Folsom streets, at the oppo
site corner. Lieutenant Anderson gave
the order to charge, and the mounted offi
cers, with- clubs .in hand, rode upon the
sidewalk, while officers â¢ on foot also
charged the crowd, which sought door
v.-ays and side Â«strpets in an effort to get
away from the officers. In a very few
minutes the crowd had scattered like
chaff before the wind. Some returned, but
were orderfrd off the street again. In half
an hour afterward Sixth street had re
sumed its normal quiet. . . â¢
THBEE EIOTEES HELD
i^j : AT POLICE STATION
The mounted police were specially use
ful yesterday in keeping the crowds mov
ing. Mounted and foot, however, they
had their hands more than full and for
two hours were kept busy following thv?
rushes which greeted 'the appearance on
Sixth street of every non-union teamster.
Two horses were injured in the course
of the riot. One was severely stabbed in
the shoulder. Another shot in the hind
foot. The bullet in the latter case is said
to have come from a gun in the hands
of Special Officer Ashcrof t, on guard on
the Farnsworth & Ruggles dray. The
dray was surrounded by strikers and the
shot was fired by the special in defending
â¢hims=elf from the crowd which after
ward chased him. He fired again at his
pursuers v.'hen near Mission street, but
his bullet lodged in a shoeblack stand.
About 6 o'clock a dray, without any
thing about it to indicate its ownership,
drove down Sixth street, below Folsom.
A resular police officer was on the seat
beside the driver. As the team was in
front of the engine house on the corner
of Shipley street a fusillade of stones,
bricks and concrete was hurled at the
driver.. Some of the missiles came in dan
gerously close proximity to him, but he
whipped up his horses and drove through
the lanes of strikers and. past the machin
ists' headquarters as fast as -the .horses
could be made to eo. ' ' ' .

HUNDREDS OF STRIKERS IN FRENZIED MOB HOLD SIXTH STREET IN REIGN OF TERROR
The other match of the semi-finals was
a. great surprise to followers of the game.
Miss Violet Sutton and Drummond Me-
Gavin were expected to beat Miss May
Sutton and W. B. Collier, but the latter
won easily in straight sets. The score <n
favor of Miss Sutton and Collier was 6-4,
6-3. Miss Violet Sutton played' her usual
steady game, while the. brilliant, but er
ratic McGavln was far off In his play.
Had he played the game of the previous
day his team would probably have won.
The remarkable match of the morning
brought out a large crowd in the after
noon to witness the finals, but two such
matches very seldom occur- in one day
and yesterday was no exception to the
rule. In the first set Miss Hail and Whit
ney ran the score up to 5-0 In .their favor
and from the way their opponents â¢ were
playing it soon became evident that Miss
Hall and Whitney would win. The score
In favor of the latter was 6-2. In the sec
ond set the losers improved somejn their
play and won â 6-4. The last set was a
repetition of the first,- the -champions
running the score up to 4-0 and vantage
In their favor. Miss Sutton and Collier
took a brace and won the next two games,
but the succeeding two went to the win
ners rather easily. The complete score
was 6-2, 4-6, 6-2.
Miss Sutton was decidedly off in her
play and Collier, who is not a very good
The second eet was won rather easily
by Miss Sutton and Smith, who led at 6-3
and won outâ 6-4. Smith had his first
cramp in the ankle in this set, but ha
and nis partner won it out. In the last
Bet Whitney and Miss Hall won the first
two games, but their opponents took tlie
next three easily, and with a lead of
SO-love and their opponents about ready
to quit in despair they seemed to have
everj-thlng their own way. At this stage
of . the game Smith got a had cramp in
the calf of- his leg. after which he was
hardly able to move around on the court.
Miss Sutton was forced to do most of the
playing and tried hard to stave off defeat,
but to no avail. When Smith became dis
abled the winners seemed to take heart
and everything then went their way, the
score being 6-3.
Miss Sutton passed Whitney time and
time again with beautiful back-hand
cross-court drives. Miss Hall played well
in this match, but was slightly outclassed.
The serving and smashing of Smith
seemed to strike terror to the heart of
Miss Hall and she was able to do but
little.
Throughout the match the spectators
yelled themselves hoarse and all agreed
that it was by far the best match of the
week.
Contrary to expectations by far the best
match of the day was In the semi-finals
Â¦when George Whitney and Miss Hall were
opposed to Grant Smith and Miss Florence
Sutton. Up to yesterday morning May
Sutton was the star of the sisters,
but she was certainly eclipsed by her
sister Florence yesterday. The game
put up by Miss Florence Sutton in the
morning was by far the best tennis
ever played by a woman on this coast.
The ease with which she handled Cham
pion Whitney's speedy serves and drives
was remarkable. The defeat of Miss But
ton and Smith was unquestionably due to
the cramps suffered by the latter In the
last two sets. The first set of the match
â¢was the longest ever played in any coast
championship tournament and after a des
perate struggle in which the losers were
In the lead many times the set finally
Â¦went to Miss Hall and Whitneyâ 12-10.
The winners led at 3-0, but their op
ponents ran the score up to 5-4 in their
lavor only to Io6e in the end.
The first mixed doubles tournament for
the championship of the coast came to a
close j'eEterday on the courts of the Hotel
Rafael. The present champions of -the
coast In singlesâ Miss Miriam Hall and
George Whitneyâ were the winners. Miss
May Sutton and W. B. Collier were the
runners-up. In the final match play was
rather close, but the outcome was evi
dent from the start. The score in favor
of Miss Hall and Whitney was 6-2, 4-6, C-2.

mainsail was hoisted at 10:40, and ten
minutes later the same club topsail that
was set yesterday went up. The wind was
light from the southeast at this time, and
when the yacht filled away and headed
for the Southwest Spit Buoy she was
traveling at six-knot gait. As 6he en
tered . the channel Captain Sycamore
headed her straight for Staten Island.
The steam yacht Erin had meanwhile ta
ken on board a number of the members
of Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, who had
been brought to Sandy Hook by the po
lice patrol, boat. At Atlantic Highlands
she picked up some others who had come
down on the Sandy Hook boats and she
followed the Shamrock up the channel to
the northward. Every passing steamer
saluted the yacht as she sailed at almost
steamboat speed up the bay.
From Coney Island Point down to the
Southwest Spit it was a long stretch,
close hauled on the port tack. The Sham
rock was able to lay her course easily in
th6 smooth water and she passed the
buoy at 1:23. She had covered the. first
half in one hour and fifteen minutes
against a strong tide and the second half
in. Just fifty minutes. -This was consid
ered by the experts to be very good time,
considering the breeze she had. .
After a bit of maneuvering Captain
Sycamore gybed her and started back
over the same course with a somewhat
lighter breeze and with exactly the same
sail that the yacht had carried in yes
terday's spin. This time she only went
to Craven Shoal Buoy, about a mile out
side Â¦ the Narrows, and then, turning
around, Bhe made another long stretch on
the port tack to the Spit Buoy, where she
quit for the day. â¢". .
NEW YORK, Aug. 28.â The fourth trial
spin of the Shamrock II In these waters,
sailed to-day, was not attended with any
exciting incidents. The yacht did not go
outside Sandy Hook as expected, but sail
ed from Southwest Spit Buoy to Staten
Island twice, covering a distance of about
thirty miles in four hours.

"WOODLAND, Aug. 28.â The feature of
the fair to-day was the bronco busting
exhibition, which called out a big crowd.
The contestants were William Starks of
Montana, Orln Morris of* Yolo County,
Â¦William Welch of Red Bluff. Sam Young
and D. B. Gruwell. Two Santa Clara
County officials presided. The horses used
were the most vicious that could be found
in the county. ?
Each contestant was allowed one assist
ant. Morria. the Yolo County entry
made the best time In mounting. The
mounts of Starks and Young were com
paratively tame. The other horses bucked
and kicked from start to finish. None of
the riders were thrown. Morris' mount
jumped two fences; Gruwell's mount
jumped a fence, bolted into the crowd and
knocked down and seriously Injured a
spectator. The decision will be rendered
after another exhibition on Friday.
There was a big attendance from Sacra
mento at the races, the road race, for en
tries from the Sacramento Driving Club,
being the drawing card. The 2:12 trot
aroused great enthusiasm. R. T. Mc-
Greely's mare, Minnie Wilkes, in a race
against her own record lowered her time
from 2:23% to 2:17^. The running races
were not good. Long delays at the post
marred the sport.
The pavilion exhibits are Improving and
the attendance is increasing everv day
The greatest stock parade of the fair will
take place on Thursday morning. Thurs
day will be Woodland day. Most of the
business houses will be closed during the
afternoon and it is expected that the at
: tendance will be the greatest of the week.

exceeded those of corresponding days of

STANDING OF THE TEAMS
Among ! the many thoroughbred year
ling, sales to.be held next. month by .the
Fasig-Tipton, Company : at, Madison Square
Garden',] New. York, September 10, few are
attracting more attention than the Napa
Stock Farm, consignment, the property of
A; B. Spreckels of California. The young
sters from . this , establishment were
shipped over the mountains last year for
the first time and after careful inspection
|.by the critical . Easterners brought most
'encouraging. prices the night of the sale.
On Geraldyn, a daughter of the dead Ger
aldine, one' of the batch' disposed of, the
talented; ' little actress, Edna Wallace, re
cently executed a well planned coup at
Saratoga, 'the filly scoring from a fair field
at long odds.. ..,'. '".'. , ,' .. Â¦
Before their departure experts, pro
nounced this year's a . particularly | fine
crop, combining action, bone and sub
stance in. their make-up.-. Eleven are by
the-. Australian sire Crighton, four by
Ravelston, seven by 'imp. The Judge, six
by Puryear D, while" St. Carlo, Trappean,
Eolo and' General' Miles are also lightly
represented. â¢ Beyond question with his
limited opportunity imp. Crighton can be
credited a success m the stud. A splen
did individual himself and possessed of a
marvelous turn of speed, Canace, one of
his daughters, was Â¦ a sensational per
former both East and West and but for
his untimely end Catulus would -have
added still further -to (this horse's luster.
Puryear D. a winner over all sorts and
conditions of tracks, â¢ is also beginning to
attract attention through the speed shown
by Pompino and Bamboulla. The get of
his first season won $4245 in stakes and
purses. Ravelston, a young horse bred at
the Palo Alto Stock Farm, was wonder
fully fast while raced and his get seem
to Jnherit the paternal parent's speed.
Flambeau, the sire of Ravelston, also got
the great Crescendo. His many noted
sons and daughters make it needless to
dilato on the merits of St. Carlo. Trap
pean is a young horse bred at the Bitter
Root Farm, Montana, and as yet has had
no opportunity to make a reputation.
Horsemen recognize the fact that at best
purchasing yearlings is a lottery, but
good judges fancied the chestnut filly by
imp. Crighton-Folly, predicting she will
bring a neat sum. A bay filly by imp.
Crighton-Lista Hock is another catchy
looker. A brown colt by imp. Crighton
from Lady Cleveland II; dam of Georgie3
and Catulus, possesses great bone and
substance and cannot help but evoke
some spirited bidding. It would not do to
pass by the chestnut colt by imp. Crigh
ton, from Sweet Peggy, without predict
ing big things for him. He is racy look
ing and bred as he is ought to bring a big
price. In fact each and all of them look a
credit to the State where they were bred.
Suffice to say even at this early stage
they wear a "ready money" air and reflect
credit on Superintendent George Berry.

The board set next Tuesday at 10 o'clock
a. m. for. the hearing of the charges
brought against Miss Jean A. Dwyer,
teacher In the Sherman School. Superin
tendent "Webster reported that he had
investigated the charges made by the
Misses - Barlow and Hurley, principals,
and that a letter sent by the last named
gave "no 'additional fact, but simply re
iterated a former request for the transfer
of Miss Dwyer; also that the allegations

' The . charges, made by Principal Albert
Lyser of the John Swett School against
one of his teachers were referred to the
Superintendent for investigation.
The president and secretary of the board
were authorized to execute a lease of the
lot on Seventh and Harrison streets to be
used as a playground.-
Leave of absence was granted for one
year to Miss Emily P. Rhine.
Superintendent "Webster was allowed an
additional appropriation of $500 for the
purchase of books for poor pupils.
After eome discussion a resolution was
adopted in which the City Attorney was
requested to give an opinion as to whether
when a teacher is elected to the school
department she is thereby bound by con
tract to observe the rules and regulations
with special 'reference . to the . rule which
reads that "..Whenever; a. female teacher
marries,' her -position thereby becomes
vacant." v - ' , Â¦
A- former, opinion of -the City Attorney
and a Superior . Court decision both hold
that when a teacher marries she cannot
for that reason be found fpillty of unpro
fessional â¢ conduct â¢. or ; - incapacitated for
teaching, - and therefore'may not be re
moved. The case has been appealed, but
the board, fearing thai the Supreme Court

The report of the schooner Mary and Ida
in regard to the probable loss of the Arago
Is probably Incorrect. The captain of the
barkentine Fremont reports that July 27
he was aboard the Arago and that she
then had 52,000 codfish. She was a long
distance from the reported wreck and it
could not have been her that was ashore.
Some of the^ captains of the codfishlng
fleet think it may be the schooner Enter
prise that Is ashore. She left- Nome for
San Francisco and -was to call at points In
the Aleutian group on a prospecting trip.
She is a very similar vessel to the Arago
and could easily be mistaken for her.
Schooner Arago Safe.

STEAM SCHOONER GRACE DOLLAR TOWING THE DISABLED . COLX.IER EMPIRE INTO PORT. THE EMPIRE
BROKE DOWN OFF TRINIDAD AUGUST 21 AND WAS DRIFTING AROUND AT . THE MERCY OF THE
WINDS AND WAVES WHEN PICKED UP.
The disabled collier Empire was towed
into port yesterday by the steam schooner
Grace Dollar. The Empire sailed from
here for Coos Bay last week and when off
Trinidad her tail shaft broke. She was
reported and a tug sent out to look for
her. The Grace Dollar came along in the
meantime and picking her up brought her
into this port. In his report the ca.ptain
of the Empire says his vessel broke down
on August 21 at 11:30 p. m. when twenty
right miles southwest of Trinidad. She
drifted around until August 26 at 2 a. m..
when she was taken In tow by the Grace
Dollar. The latter was on her way from
Grays Harbor for San Pedro and as soon
as she dropped her tow here proceeded on
her voyage.
Empire Towed to Port.
In deciding in favor of the School Board
Judge Seawell has practically ended Miss
McKenzle's fight for reinstatement, so
far as the Superior Court is concerned,
though it fs probable that the Supreme
Court will be called upon to analyze the
decision and determine its soundness.
At the hearing Miss McKenzie was rep
resented by counsel, but her efforts to
disprove the charges were futile. She was
dismissed and forthwith filed suit for re
instatement. In passing upon her claim
that the Board of Education was not vest
ed with authority to dismiss a teacher
except after investigation of formal
charges filed by the Superintendent of
Schools Judge Sea well says:
"The power to dismiss is not limited to
rases where charges are made by the
Superintendent. The demurrer is sus
tained."'
Judgre Sea-well has sustained the legality
cf the dismissal of Miss Margaret ilc-
Kenzle by the Board of Education from
the position of principal of the Hancock
Grammar SchooL The court sustained a
demurrer yesterday filed on behalf of the
tooard of Education to Miss McKenzia's
?* J^ n Â£ or a writ oÂ£ mandate to compel
lh Â« board to reinstate her.
Â«f^>f s Jf cK ! Mie disputed the jurisdiction
or the Board of Education or its right to
VL her . u Pon charges filed by any person
other than the Superintendent of Schools,
ine charges against her. which were not
prererred by the Superintendent of
Schools. Included the complaint that she
had declined to introduce "Thanatopsis"
and Snowbound" among the studies at
the school and had failed to send pupils
of the eighth grade to the High School
for examination.

Upon to File All
Charges.

"It deserves the highest praise, and I
know that those who have tried it have
"/ endorse Peruna because I have
found by personal experience that it is
not a common patent medicine, but a
scientifically prepared medicine which
simply curds catarrh and cleanses the
blood of its impurities, keeping the
system in a fine, healthy condition.
I consider It as rather a carefully pre-
pared physician's prescription, and have
never found any which acts as promptly
and permanently as Peruna.

"/ can conscientiously recommand
your Peruna as a fine tonic and all-
round good madicine. To ihoso who
ara in need of a catarrh remedy I
know of nothing better."â H. W.
Ogden.
F. "W. Radtke. 740 Mlntzer street. Phila-
delphia. Pa., writes:
"I deem it my duty to inform you that I
have been troubled with catarrh for four
years and could not work at my. trade. I
have tried almost every cure on the faca
of the earth, .and had doctors attend me
at . their offices and in the hospital, but
could not pet relief until I tried your
wonderful Â¦ Peruna. I was very doubtful
whether it would help me. but at a good
friend's advice I tried your Peruna. which
is a godsend to all catarrh sufferers. After
taking but four bottles I am very much
pleased indeed. I can safely say that one
more bottle will be enough. After taking
the second bottle I could go to work at
my trade (sawyer), and the dust ha3 no
effect on my throat now. I shall recom-
mend Peruna to everybody who suffers
with catarrh."â F. W. Radtke.
If you do not derive prompt and satis-
factory results from the use of Peruna.
write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a
full statement of your case, and he will
be pleased to sjive you his valuable advtca
gratis.
Address Dr. Hr.rtman, President of The
Hartman Sanitarium. Columbus, O.
After all, the personal experience of one
man is worth - more than the theoretical
guesses of a thousand men. Mr. Jenkins
knowswhat he is talking about when he
recommends Peruna, because he has tried
It- Peruna cures catarrh because it
reaches the source of catarrh.
Peruna cleanses the blood of Its Impuri-
ties, because it regulates those organs
that make blood.
Peruna keeps the system in a fine,
healthy condition, because it restores the
function of every organ and brings vigor
to the organic nervous system.
Mr. Jenkins is right. Peruna is a care-
fully prepared prescription, prepared by
one of the oldest and best known physi-
cians in America. This is why it acts
promptly and permanently.

It is said that the failure of his cylindrical balloon
has decided Santbs-Dumont to make the next one

balloon to travel on its name or its shape, the new

, It is announced that. when the Czar visits France
he will be entertained :by a' review, of 150,000 troops;
but it would have been more. appropriate to call an
international peace conference to meet him and show
him how- it can work. ' /
The agitation for a change in the date of inaugura
ting Presidents so as to fix it for the end of April in-
I stead of March 4 is going briskly on in the East, and
it begins to look as if there might be something, done
about it at the coming session of Congress.

In 1S57 the railroad company in Rome
decided to present to/Pope Pius IX a
private railroad carriage, which .was j to
consist of an oratory, a salon and a sleep
ing 'compartment, ~ and osvhich was to be
decorated by the eminent Gerome. The
artist accepted the commission, and in due
time three beautiful paintings by . him
adorned .the carriage. One was a grand
allegorical work, in j which the truths of
religion were represented by ' St. Peter

which the Pope was represented as bless

POPE'S CARRIAGE LOST
Parisian reformers have come' to the conclusion
that vice in their city is due mainly to holiday visit
ors' They^ have compiled statistics showing that it
blossoms out on the streets as soon as the tourists
begin to come in and dies out - when they depart.
One of them has gone so far as to s say that Americans
do more harm to Paris than Paris\does to them/ -
When the valorousrand mystical- Owen Glendower
declared, "I can call spirits frt5m^ the vasty deep/'
Harry Hotspur replied, "So can ? I and so..; can any
man; but will they come?" Much the same sort of
answer has been > made by practical politicians in the
East to the Alabama enthusiast who claims to. be
able to call up Clay and Webster. from the ivasty^deep
The advocate of the, revival asserts, that Webster
and Clay were the greatest of American statesmen,
that the principles they inculcated and the -policies
they approved during their lives are as excellent and
as valid now as" they were in the days when the two
great orators, with living voices, expounded them in
the Senate and declaimed them to â¢ the people.
Therefore, says he, let us resuscitate the-^party of
Webster and of Clay and appeal to the people in the
next election on a platform declaring for "the Union,
the constitution; as -it was in i860, and the enforce
ment of all just laws." ."",.-< . : :-.
DURING the silly season, when politicians have

California has had a prosperous year, and her peo
ple should now be ready to enjoy it. The opening
of the fair will afford recreation and instruction for
all classes. The patronage should be" large and
should come from all parts of the State. Every ef
fort has been made to prepare an exposition that will
awaken the gratification and the pride of Californians,
and now the popular support should be liberal and
abundant.
The racing at the fair will be exceptionally inter
esting. " California is the land where the horse
reaches his highest perfection. We have not the
large number of wealthy stables that is found in
New York, nor so many almost historic breeding
farms as Kentucky, but already we have become
famous for the excellence of our horses of every kind,
and the entries that have been made for the various
events at the fair assure a season of sport hardly to
be surpassed in any part of the Union.
It js the expectation that all the exhibits 'intended
for the fait will be in place in readiness for the open
ing on Monday evening. Still it is noted that a good
many exhibitors have been slow in making up their
minds to take part in the display, for applications for
space are being received at this late date. With prop
erly directed energy, however, all can be completed
in time to fulfill the expectation of a. complete exhi
bition on the opening day, and from the reports that'
come from Sacramento it seems that the energy is
not lacking in any department.
The California State Fair ought to be the most im
portant of its kind in the Union. In the first place
the State has richer, larger and more varied agri
cultural resources than any other State, not even ex
cepting the giant commonwealth of Texas. In the
second place the location of the State and its trade
conditions give it a prestige in its own territory not
possessed by any other State. On this coast we have
no rivals. In this section of the Union the year "'is
not marked by any of those large expositions which
have now become so common in the East. The Cali
fornia State Fair is therefore in a position to com
mand attention as the chief exposition of the Pa
cific Coast, and as such it merits the liberal support
REPORTS from Sacramento concerning prepa
rations for the State .Fair, which opens on
Monday, give assurance that the exhibits of
the year will fully reflect the abundant prosperity and
growing improvement of the State. ! It is of course
natural that it should be so, for as California ad
vances, so should all her institutions advance. The
State Fair in particular ought to reflect the growth of
the industries and material welfare of the people, and
it is gratifying to know that it will do so on this oc
casion.

rights" have deliberately forced the negro citizens of thÂ« city
from every avenue of any but the most menial employment.
Negro citizens are refused admission to their unions and the
advent of a negro mechanic or laborer among them is fol
lowed by his expulsion. His family can starve. For thl3
. reason no negroes can be seen employed in the shops or along
the wharves of San Francisco, although these men are our
feliow-citizens. Even avocations once considered beneath the
dignity of the American white man are now "unionized" and
filled and the '"Scullions' Union," the "Bootblacks' Aggrega
tion" and the "Pot and Pan Washers* Association" drive the
negro from their ranks, thereby denying him the chance to
earn his humble pittance. Ye gods! and these are the men
who prate of "human rights" and squeal like stuck pigs when,
they realize (as they now must) that their cause haa been lost.
It is this tyrannical hypocrisy that Is detaching from the
unions large numbers of their members. "When the unions
themselves cease to be a tyrant and a living lie, ruled by agi
tators, the public will be more Inclined to believe their asser
tions about "rights" that they claim for themselves but deny
to others in the most despotic manner. Respectfully yours,

PERSONAL MENTION.
* Â¦ DITOR San Francisco Call: I am one of the laboring
â4 men of. San Francisco. ,For fifteen years I have resided
-'-Â¦j in this city and I was until lately a member, in good
"^ - " standing, of the union. As all_of the affairs of the or
ganization have been discussed before the public by the self
styled leaders, representatives and exponents of our wants, the .
Caseys, Rosenbergs and the German anarchist (who uses his
official position in the labor councils to propagate and dissem
inate his socialistic theories), I suppose that a few words from
the rank and file of. the labor army will be accorded a place
in your fair and impartial columns.
My own reasons fo& withdrawing from the union were that
I found that the union under its present blatant demagogues
was tenfold more tyrannical than any corporation or employer
I ever worked for. That the condition of the poor, deluded
devils who are blindly following their lead is systematically
concealed from the public is well known among the union men
themselves. It must have been with a smile- of contempt that
the intelligent public read the verbose and ytterly lying "open
letter" by the San Francisco Labor Council, addressed to the
editors of the interior press. ' I will only quote one passage of
this hypocritical screedâ "human rights are more sacred than
business success." The fellows who prate so glibly of "human

try at large.
/ Of such a party, so constituted "and^ so led, the
country. can expect nothing. It does not afford even
a- reasonable opposition parfy to serve as a check
upon Republican extremists. It is in fact absolutely
valueless to the country. Conservative s Democrats
who after the Ohio convention may have indulged
the hope that they would once more have power and
influence in their party will now perceive the. folly of
thejr hopes. Bryanism is* still strong and 'wherever
anything' is to be gained â¢ even temporarily by yield
ing to it the politicians of the party will- consent. The
Iowa platform, therefore, while of no value in that
State is still one of much significance for" the' coun-
.The one feature of importance in the event is the
added proof that Democracy as a political party .with
clearly defined aims in national politics has ceased to
exist. The men who are now leading the different
States are using its name and its # machinery for per
sonal purposes only,- and each" set adopts such a
declaration of principles as they deem most advan
tageous in their own States for the present cam
paign. Thus Ohio, Democrats ignore Bryan's platr
form and virtually repudiate Bryan himself; in Mary
land similar tactics are followed; in "Pennsylvania
they declare for a "non-partisan" campaign; while in
Iowa they ostentatiously bid for the Populist vote.
Conceding that something in the way of voting
strength. has been gained by reaffirming the Kansas
City platform, there remains the question whether the
gain is worth having.. Even with the full support of
the Populists in Iowa, the Democrats cannot win
in that State, and their manifestation, of continued
devotion to the*.' exploded fallacies of Bryanism. will
prevent any return of the conservative Democrats.
It is therefore a barren victory and one over which
there will be little exultation even among the Bryan
ites themselves. .
In the debate on the question itwas asserted by
some of- the Bryanite speakers that to" ignore the
Kansas City platform would lose to the party in Iowa
upward of 20,000 voters. The estimate was prob
ably an exaggerated one, made to suit the occasion,
but there is undoubtedly a measurable degree of
truth in it. There are a good many radicals in Iowa,
as was shown by the support General Weaver had
there, and they have been induced to vote for Demo
cracy only because Democratic platforms have con
formed to their peculiar ideas 'about money. To
have ignored their platform would probably have led
to a loss of their, votes, and without them Demo
cracy in Iowa would hardly be more than a faction.
Of course as- Iowa is surely Republican, notonly
for this year but for 1904 as well, the adoption of
the Bryan platform by the Democracy of that State
will hardly have much - political effect. It serves,
however, to show that the free silver man i$ not so
hopelessly in a minority of his party as some persons
have supposed. He and his friends have still strength
enough to make a fight in -some quarters, and will
probably retain it'long enough to be able to' give a
good account of themselves in the next national con
vention.
setback.
BRYAN has received from the Democrats of
Iowa something of consolation for the wrong
put upon him by those of Ohio,- Pennsylvania
and Maryland. In the Iowa State Convention a
majority of the committee on resolutions reported a
platform ignoring the declarations made by the
national convention at Kansas City, but the minority
insisted on a substitute which explicitly reaffirmed '
those declarations, and when a vote was taken, the
substitute received 669^ votes against 550^. So
Bryan scored a victory and the reorgariizers had a
ONE FOR BRYAN.
A double suicide in New England has brought to
light the-fact that a married, man had been for years

and now the moralists do not know whether'; to con
demn him for falseness to his sweethearts or praise
him for fidelity to his wife. Â¦
Under the Examiner's advice street cleaning
stopped. That prime necessity for the health of the
people ceased.. The teamsters who hauled the waste,
in violation of a contract, urged by the Examiner's
impish malice, refused to keep their agreement and
the thoroughfares of this city will soon need graders
instead of sweepers. The people have the filth blown
in their faces, into their stores and houses, carrying
deathly germs, all that the Examiner's idiotic malice
may be indulged and z few more nickels get into its
cash drawer. "\
When the country produce was put in peril of de
struction, by its evil advice to tie up handling and
shipping, it felt retribution coming, from the coun
try and its counting room conscience was .touched.
Thereupon it began a frantic effort to shift the re
sponsibility to the employers who had nothing to do
whatever with the sympathetic strike of the steve
dores and longshoremen and had no power to end it.
Every farmer knows that the wheat blockadei can be
broken when the stevedores, who quit without griev
ance, return to an employment in which they had no
complaint. Let those who shut the crop out of mar
ket by ordering, the strike without grievance permit
their deluded followers to return to work, and the
crops will move. The employers are not responsible,
no demand involving hours or wages is made upon
them, , and as no concession is asked how can they
grant any? . .
When calm and dispassionate consideration was
needed, the Examiner daily seeks, to excite lawless and
insurrectionary passion, riot, bloodshed and anarchy.
By shameless effrontery and misrepresentation-it
has sought to make the earnest and enterprising
business men of this community appear as inhuman
monsters of greed, indifferent to the rights of their
fellow men, and has held over them the threat of mob
violence, boycott and rapine, which it openly advo
cates.. Â¦ ' Â¦.:Â¦ Â¦Â¦;- Â¦:'-,:
The Examiner loudly proclaims that the city is
without police protection and invites an invasion
of thugs and thieves, and yet when special police are
employed to furnish protection it denounces that and
saj's their employment is superfluous ana insulting!
It lies shamelessly about the number and character
of assaults upon persons and property by strikers and
their sympathizers, though these have been minimized
by the very police protection which it denounces. In
this land of law and liberty can it be regarded as a
slight thing that even one man in the exercise of an
inalienable right to labor for the support of his fam
ily is beset by a mob, beaten, broken and left to suf
fer, languish and perhaps die? These things occur
numerously every day and yet the Examiner tells its
readers that police protection is unnecessary and an
insult to the strikers! What a devil's roar that paper
would make if such a cowardly mob of employers
should attack and beat a striking employe â¢ as he
walked the street peaceablj-!
In pursuance of its policy the Examiner has vili
fied the Police Department, which has patiently and
temperately done its duty in preserving order. No
honest man can object because a laborer is protected
in his right to work, nor because a merchant's goods
are protected in transit on the streets. The man or
newspaper objecting is at bottom a criminal.
When the Examiner, using as its pretext a lie about
Mr. Frank Symmes, injected itself intothe contioversy
and proceeded to out-Herod Herod, the public was
not surprised. A ripple of amusement passed over
the city, for every one knows that, the only controll
ing principle .of the Examiner is money getting â <lirty
or clean, matters not. No money can come to it foul
enough to soil thehands that grasp it. Its reasoning
was plain. It said: "We will take up the cause of
the strikers. We will shout and outlie everybody.
They number thousands. We will get them to? stop
other papers and take ours. Merchants and manu
facturers have destructible property. They are' timid.
If they stop advertising" we will bully them into com
ing back." Upon that line the Examiner acted. If
the unions had suffered its friendship in silence they
would not have lost ground, for no man is respon
sible for the folly of his fool friends. But they ac
cepted their new leader and ruined their cause. -
The striking employes in San Francisco should
realize by. this time that the Examiner's management
of their case is alienating their friends, antagonizing
their well wishers, and. toughening into steel the
fighting fiber of .their opponents. Left alone, an un
biased public opinion would look kindly upon them.
To-day public opinion in California is wholly against
them". â¢
A good cause, however; is frequently lost by the
use of bad means in its advancement. When labor
unions are advised to use unlawful means, and to
deny to others the rights claimed for themselves, they
are on untenable ground and cannot win. By seek
ing ends not lawful they sacrifice more desirable
ends that are lawful/ ;â¢ :
EVERY, fair minded man recognizes the right ;of
labor to combine to better its condition, within
. lawful bounds and by lawful means.
BAD ADVICE.
Here, then, js a party, a ; platform and , a ticket
ready-made for any citizen who wishes to get in and
shout for it. Whether- such a party could run with
any success may be questioned, but there can be no
dispute that it could flyâ for' it would be a bird. â¢

Superintendent W. J. Kelly of the Alms
house filed his annual report yesterday
with the Health Board/ The report shows
the total number of inmates admitted was
1C15, of which 731 were discharged or died.
The yearly cost for each inmate was
$&3 33. The highest number of Inmates
recorded for one day was 1024, on January
27. 1901, the lowest SSO, on June 29, 1901.
Report on Almshouse.
It is alleged that the contract would
have netted great profit for the Cali
fornia Packers' Company, as the price
to be paid was far below market value.
Realizing this fact, the plaintiffs allege,
R. W. Hersey entered into a conspiracy
with W. M. Griffin, Charles B. Bills and
Albert E. Castle, all being interested in
the California Packers' Company, where
by It was made to appear that tTie
prunes had not been purchased by the
California Packers' Company, but by the
California Dried Fruit Agency, and by
it aesold to all the defendants except the
California Packers' Company.
The defendants named, with the ex
ception of the California Packers' Com
pany, it is alleged, appropriated the
prunes and sold them at increased
prices. Hersey, it is claimed, permitted
them to pay the California Packers'
Company just the purchase price of the
prunes, which he then turned over to
the defendants, with the exception of the
California Packers' Company, for their
profit. . f
Through the operation of this alleged
conspiracy the plaintiffs aver that all the
profits went, not to the original con
tractor, but to Hersey and the other de
fendants. The plaintiff stockholders in
the California Company now
seek to enforce the original contract
and compel the other defendants to ac
count to the California Packers' Com
pany for all prunes received, that judg
ment for profits earned may be entered
in favor of the California Packers' Com
pany and'ag-ainst the other defendants.
In the complaint the plaintiffs allege
that on July 30, 1301, the California Pack
ers' Company entered into an agreement
with the California Cured Fruit Asso
ciation for the purchase^ of 24,000,000
pounds of prunes at prices ranging from
1*4 to 1% cents a pound. The sum. of
$50,000 was to be paid on delivery and
$200,000, if the balance due should amount
to this figure, ten days after the prunes
were weighed. After weighing the dif
ference in money between the parties
was to be adjusted and the deal closed.
The plaintiffs in the case are A. G.
Freeman, the S. K. Armsby Company
and the firm of Miller and Hotchkiss.
The defendants are the California Pack
ers' Company, W. M. Griffin, Charles B.
Bills, Albert E. Castle, R. W. Her&ey,
the Griffin & Skelly Company, the Porter
Brothers 1 Company, Charlotte L.. Castle,
Castle Brothers, the California Dried
F"ruit Agency, the Phoenix Dried Fruit
Company, the Phoenix Raisin Seeding
and Packing Company, A. Gartenlaub,
Rosenberg Brothers & Co., the J. B. In
derreiden Company and John R. Adams.
The plaintiffs are stockholders in the
California Packers' Company to the ex
tent of 725 out of the 6025 shares, while
the defendants, Hersey, W. M. Griffin,
Albert E. Castle and Charles B. Bills,
control the corporation, it is claimed.

INVESTIGATION ' INTO ;
BIVER COLLISION
Watchman Erickson and Pilot Hide-
out Give Important Testimony
as to the Signals.
Captains . Bolles ; and Bulger, United
States Jjocal Inspectors of Steam Ves
sels, began on yesterday afternoon an In
vestigation into the sinking of the river
steamer Dauntless last Saturday by the
Mary Garratt. A. L. Levlnsky appeared
as counsel for Eugene P. Rideout, pilot
for the Garratt.
Louis Erickson, bow watchman of the
Dauntless, testified that he saw the Gar
ratt coming- when the steamers were about
three-quarters of a mile apart. He saw
all her lights and she was coming head-on.
The Garratt did not change her course and
the Dauntless went to the right. - Then
the Garratt struck her amidships' and she
went down. Erickson on cross-examina

The attempt of the Odd Fellows' Cem
etery Association to nullify the ordinance
prohibiting the burial of the dead within
the city limits by an action against the
city and county to restrain the Board of
Supervisors and police, from enforcing the
same was thrown out of court by Judge
Seawell yesterday. A motion made by
Attorneys Sims and McEnerny. repre
senting the city, for judgment on the
pleadings was granted.
The attorneys for the city made their
motion for judgment on the pleadings
upon the grounds that there was a mis-
Joinder of parties; that the plaintiff's rem
edy lay not in a bill of equity to declare
the ordinance invalid; that the plaintiff's
case was in the nature of a quasi criminal
prosecution and should have been brought
In the name of the people; that the pros
ecution of a criminal action could not be
restrained by injunction and that the
State could not be made a party to such
a proceeding. . â¢
Judge Seawell stated that the conten
tions of the attorneys for the city were
based upon recognized precedents and ex
pressed the opinion that the proper rem-"
edy to pursue would be to wait until an
arrest had been made for a violation of
the ordinance and then in defense plead
the unconstitutlonality of the act.
- All of these appointments are to become
effective on the first of September ami it
is generally believed that they are but \\\c
forerunners of other and more important
innovations.. - ' Â¦.:Â¦ - >

Finally the scientific student has discov-
ered a certain remedy for dandruff. When
it first became known that dandruff is the
result of a germ or parasite that digs into
the scalp and saps -the vitality of hair at
the. root, causing falling hair and bald-
ness, biologists set to work to discover
some preparation that will kill 'the germ.
After a year's labor in "one laboratory the
dandruff germ destroyer was discovered,
and it is now embodied in Newbro's Hero-
iclde, which, besides curing baldness arid
thinning hair,, speedily and permanently
eradicates dandruff. "Destroy the cause,
you remove the effect." - . â¢

lower. The . feature to the trading was the

The leading futures ranged as follows:
CHICAGO, Aug. 28.â Wheat ruled weak at the
opening and prices were . a shade ; lower, the
bear feature being the heavy Northwest fj re
ceipts. Under the influence of. the strength ln
corn, steady cables and reports of good, cash
demand, both at Duluth and New York, prices
advanced, but later In sympahy with corn and
on a lack of outside support the market weak
ened again. Liquidation â¢ was the prevailing
feature, with but little new â¢ buying demand.
December opened %c to Uc lower at'7l%@72c,
and after an early advance to 72%@72%c prices
gradually sagged, the low point, being reached
at 71%c. The close was %c lower at 71%c.
There was considerable strength exhibited
early ln corn, brought about by renewed buy
ing, mostly on short account. . Local, longs and
many commlsison house bulls were disposed to
unload their holdings, influenced by the rela
tively large primary receipts, reported improve
ment in crop condition and slow. export demand,'
and a reaction followed. December closed with
a loss of %c at 56%@56%c.

Beans are dull at the moment, but it is said
that there is still a large September short in
.terest, which will have to fill its contracts with
in the next thirty days. Part of the recent ad
vance was due to the running up of prices on
these shorts. Regarding the Michigan crop,
which is a source of great interest now, most of
the reports received here say that â¢ it will be
large, and if so it may have an effect on our

BOSTON, Aug. 2S.â The American Cotton and
Wool Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
market continues firm. The demand, however,
has been mostly from the smaller mills, the
large . consumers having satisfied their needs
for the time being at any rate and the volume
of sales during the past week has been less
than I that of the previous week. There have
been no sales of large blocks of wool, such as
characterized the market a few weeks ago, but
from the smaller mills the demand has been
quite active, which has given a firmer tone to
the market. That there will be more wool
needed than a year ago^ is generally believed,
in view of the 'act that the public' demand
for goods has changed from those in which
shoddy and cotton are used in the better class
of goods, which means; that more wool . and
fewer substitutes will . be consumed this year
than for. some time past. This change ln the
public demand is reflected also in a decided
pressure for the better, class of '.wools and
fine wools are especially 'firm, in good demand
and in not over abundant supply. Â¦ There is
good inquiry for fine territory and fine.- The
receipts of wool at Boston this week amounted
to 24,347 bales, against 32,216 bales last week
and 15,946 bales last year. The ' total' receipts
eince January 1 have been 461,563 bales do
mestic and 101,881 bales foreign, against 275,690
bales domestic and 113,109 bales foreign for the
corresponding period of 1900. This is an- in
crease of 180,922 bales domestic and a decrease
of 12,288 bales foreign. Shipments of wool for
the week ending August 26 aggregate 63,697,639
pounds. This shows a decrease of 624,
069 pounds over â¢ the shipments for the
previous week. Since January 1 the total ship
ments amount to 167,711,667 pounds. The sales
of the week ln ' Boston amounted to 3,8O0,C0O
pounds domestic and 550,000. pounds foreign,
making a total of 4,350,000 pounds,, against a
total of 5,192,000 pounds for the previous week
and a total of 3,299,000. pounds for . the â¢ corre
sponding week last year. The sales since Jan
uary 1 amount to 163,673,700 pounds, against
90,560,500- pounds for the corresponding period
of last year. Â¦ â¢

NEW YORK. Aug. '28.â The stock market re
lapsed into trivialities again to-day. The vol
ume of transactions fell below half a million
shares and the mixture of net changes at the
close is wholly without significance except as
a reflection of the indecision dwelling in the
speculative minds. No attention was paid to
any news of the day, and in fact there were
no occurrences having any important bearing
on the values of securities. The bear traders
made a feeble tentative raid shortly after the
opening, but the offerings of stocks proved so
email that they became intimidated and bought
back again, covering short lines which were
left over from yesterday. The success of'yes
terday's raid seems to have been due to an
encounter with some particularly weak specu
lative line, which represented little more than a
froth easily blown off the surface of specula
tion. To-day showed stocks tenaciously held
again, notwithstanding the extreme listless
ness of the demand. Signs of renewed weak
ness in the corn market after the opening deal
ings induced some covering of shorts in stocks
from- Western sources, but these were not put
out again when corn rallied later. The ap
proach of a three-day hiatus in the stock mar
ket, with possibilities of favorable or unfa
vorable developments ln the interval was
enough to dissuade either the bulls or the
bears from committing themselves for that
length of time, and to this deterrent influence
may be added the recognized possibility of the
marking up of call loans on Friday. The re
opening of the dispute between France and
Turkey had some influence upon foreign mar
kets to-day, which was emphasized by the dis
couraging view caused by the prolongation of
the Boer war. On the other hand a settlement
of the steel strike is believed In Wall street to
be possible at any time. The market closed
dull and heavy.
There was less doing ln railroad bonds than
yesterday, but prices were about steady. Total
sales, par value, $1,500,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

CLOSING
American stocks were very narrow, but good
here, until New York selling â¢ developed which
brought them to parity. After the close there
was a sharp rally In the street, the leaders
being Atchison, Norfolk and Western, South
ern Pacrflc and Union Pacific, 'all of which ad
vanced on New York buying orders. Business
here was, however, at low ebb. Commission
houses sold this morning for an American resi
dent on this side 10,000 shares of Southern Pa
cific and 5000 shares of ether stocks. Trunk
line firsts touched par for the first time since
1884.
The stock market to-day was very slack, but
firm. Consols early in the day were heavily
sold, supposedly on account, of the French-
Turkish rupture, but rallied later. In the best
informed quarters the incident Is not seriously
regarded.

Weather Report.
"Evaporated apples are still higher and the
market is very strong both for spot goods and
future delivery. Sales of carlots of prime were
reported yesterday both at S*ic and 9c and a
sale of a car of future prime, October-Novem
ber delivery, was made at S'.jc to a speculator.
There was a rumored sale at an even higher
figure, but this was declared unfounded and
undoubtedly was reported for effect. The mar
ket for futures, however, is very firm and
ttoere aiÂ» further b!ds of 9%c for prime stock.
"Demand for nuts is showing some improve
ment." ..-i-:
Ma'.l reports from New York say: "Domestic
raisins, both loose and seeded, continue to ad
vance on the spot, leading holders yesteiday
making up the prioe of 3-crown loose to 6%c
Two-crown are virtually not -In the market and
Â»-crown are not plentiful. Sales aggregating
a car were reported made late Wednesday at
6 l ,ic about three-quarters of the car going
to a local Jobber and the remainder to an out
of-town buyer. Seeded raisins in cartons were
quoted firm at 7*i@Sc yesterday for both coast
and lodal racked goods. Demand was good,
and with the supply very light the tendency
was decidedly upward. Not many were ob
tainable at 7*ic and Sc is likely to be bottom
to-dar- Spot prunes are quiet but steady.
Prices were named through a prominent com
mission and packing house on new Visalia
prunes, sizes 40-50s, 50-6Cs and 60-70s on a 3'^c
basis on the coast, but buyers were not in
terested. Some business, it is understood, has
been quietly done on the same basis recently
in the same sizes of other prunes grown out
fide the Santa Clara Valley, but sales, it is
believed, have not been numerous. A 3Uc
price on Visalias is equivalent to a 5%c quo
tation for Santa Clara goods, at which figure
indications Ere that there would be very little
buying by the local trade.
"We are still in the midst of a traders' mar
ket. The big holders and large operators are
absent and 6eem content with keeping prices
pegged at about the present level. Public buy
ing- is conspicuous for its absence and the out
look is not foi* any special buoyancy until the
monetary situation is more favorable. At the
moment we advise profit-taking on all sharp
rallies."
New York Dried Fruit Market.
"The most encouraging feature in the whole
eftuation is the certainty of another good year
of exports. Kurope seems to have a shortage
of 490,00n,CC9 bushels of wheat and the United
States a Eurplus of about 300,000.000 bushels.
This insures us a good price for our wheat
and a good haul for the railroads. It also
strengthens the probability of gold imports,
for Europe is comparatively bare of American
etocks and cannot return them in considerable
quantities.
"The course of the money market from now
on will be Interesting. The surplus reserve
last Saturday stood at $18,421,900, compared
with $20,557,050 a year ago. The demand for
crop purposes will soon assert itself, and we
may look for a period of declining reserves
until the end of October. The reduction of
the corn crop will have little effect upon the
demand for money, the higher prices tor corn
end the abundance of wheat offsetting the
lessened inquiries from that source. General
business promises to be fairly active; though
it is questionable if it will exceed last year's
in volume. The loss from corn damage and
the strike will inevitably cause some diminu
tion of business in spots, even if the country
&s a whole does not suffer from these draw
backs. Bankers are generally anticipating a
g-ood demand for money at firm rates. Sup
plies, however, are not sufficient to permit any
active stock speculation. A rapid bull market
at this time would soon meet an insurmount
able obstacle in tight money. The treasury
receiptB continue larger than expenditures, and
this awkward movement is likely to continue
until legislation provides seme further cur
tailment of revenue or Secretary Gage buys
bonds more freely. Gold is coming in with
tome freedom from the Klondike. A favorable
feature was the weakening of foreign exchange
fiwing to large grain exports and renewed for
eign buying of American securities. If these
latter movements continue with any freedom
we ehall soon be again importing gold â a
movement that will be facilitated by the grad
ual resumption o f the South African mines.

The demand for fruits continues, and the
whole list is firm. Apples continue excited in
the East, and there is a rumor afloat that sev
eral Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore
firms are exertlns every effort to corner the
apple market. Tempting offers, it is said, have
been made to some of the Maryland growers
for. the products of their orchards, but these
growers are inclined to hold out for bigger
money.
As the Packers' Association has secured the
bullf of the Santa Clara Prunes the term "out
side Prunes" is now a thing of the past, ex
cept as regards the old crop, which is still
controlled by the association at San Jose. The

Commissioner Murphy finally termi
nated the interview by beckoning to his
secretary, who escorted Mrs. Nation from
the room. Before leaving town Mrs.
Nation said she would return Sunday and
visit the Tenderloin, and "see everything
that was open.'
"Oh, yes," said Commissioner Murphy,
"I congratulate Mr. Nation. He ought to
be a happy man now."
"Why don't you want to discuss Sun
day saloons?" asked Mrs. Nation, and the
Commissioner replied angrily:
"Because I don't want to. I won't sit
here and be lectured."
"What, do you mean to say that you
won't discuss good morals in New York?
Don't you want to talk about the closing
up of these hell holes and murder shops?
Do you think I am crazy?"
"Yes, I do," responded Commissioner
Murphy. â¢
Mrs. Nation then addressed Mr. Murphy
as "father," which term the Commis
sioner warmly resented. But the Kansas
reformer persisted.
"Father. don't you think a little
'hatchetation' would be good for New
York?" she asked.
"If you violate the laws I will have you
locked up," responded Mr. Murphy.
When Mrs. Nation entered police head
quarters she was shown at once to Com
missioner Murphy's room. In opening her
interview with the Commissioner she said
she had called upon him for an account
of his stewardship and asked if he did
not think New York was an awful wicked
place. The Commissioner . replied in the
negative and Mrs. Nation repeated the
question as an assertion, whereupon Mr.
Murphy requested her to stop, saying he
would not discuss the matter with her.
She continued, l.owever. ,to ply the Com
missioner with questions concerning
drinking place*, all of which he refused
to answer. Mrs. Nation said she had
come here to do the city some good. â¢
"You don't know what you're talking
about," said Commissioner Murphy". "Go
back to Kansas and stay there. If you
want to do something, why don't you do
it for your husband?"
"I have no husband now," said Mrs.
Nation. "I suppose you know all about
that matter."
NEW YORK. Aug. 28.â Mrs. Carrie Na
tion arrived in this city to-day. She had
an interview with Police Commissioner
Murphy, during which he told her that
she would be arrested :f she violated the
law in this city. Mrs. Nation also called
at John L. Sullivan's saloon to see the ex
pugilist in reference to a statement he
was alleged to have made to the effect
that he would "throw her in the sewer."
Sullivan sent down word that he was ill,
but made an appointment to meet her
next Monday. She then went to see
Archbishop Corrigan, but he was out of
town.
It is understood that the Britisn Min
ister, Sir Ernest Satow, proposed to re
turn the edict to the Chinese Peace Com
misslorrers as unsatisfactory, but the pro
posal failed. Several of the diplomats, In
cluding Mr. Rockhili. opposed this feature
of the protocol. Among their reasons was
that it was impossible of enforcement and
that it was illogical, while insisting that
the Chinese Government maintain order,
:o deprive it of the means of so doing.
Whereas a month ago the Chinese Com
missioners were importuning the Ministers
to conclude the negotiations, it is now the
Ministers who are daily visiting Li Hung
Chang on a smilar errand. Several of the
Ministers expect to be transferred to more
pleasant posts at the conclusion of their
laoors and all are wearied with the con
finement in Peking during the tropical
months.
Diplomats Becoming Weary.
Prince Chun has dropped his pretense
of indisposition and is keeping up con
stant telegraphic communication with Pe
king. One cable message cost him $S(W.
The members of the Chinese mission are
not permitted to leave the hotel. This, it
is alleged. Is due to the personal orders of
Emperor William. '
PEKING. Aug. 2Â£â The imperial edict
forbidding the importation of arms and
munitions of Â¦war is not satisfactory to
the foreign Ministers. A meeting of the
Ministers has been called to discuss the
edict. It ignores the vital fact that the
prohibition applies to the Government <md
that it is part of the Chinese punishment.
The edict makes it appear to be merely
the Government's voluntary act, prohibit
ing Chinese subjects from importing arms
and ammunition, as the country is dis
turbed by brigands. â¢ -
Later in the dav it was announced the
Ministers had decided to accept the edict,
but to omit the first paragraph in pub
lishing it as part of the appendix to the
protocol.
Costly Messages to Peking.
The immediate attendants of Prince
Chun are decidedly indignant at their
summary handling, by tne German offi
cials, herr von Kausch. who is attached
to the mission in behalf of the German
Government, is calmly completing travel
ing arrangements, in spite of the Chinese
assertions that they may not proceed to
Berlin. Some of the minor Chinese ofli
eiai6 objected to lodging on the fourth
floor of the tiotel, but Von Rausch
promptly intervened and compelled them
to accept the quarters to which they had
been assigned. Seeing that the lowest in
ranks of the members of the retinue are
prominent nobles, such coercion is not rel
ished.
BERLIN, Aug.. 2S.â While official circles
etill believe that Prince Chun, head of the
Chinese special mission to Germany, Is ill
at Basle and will come to Berlin, in a
few days, the I.okal Anzeiger's ' Berne
correspondent to-day interviewed Herr
von Rausch, business manager of the mis
sion, who says the delay was due to ques
tions of formalities at the Berlin recep
tion. He regards these as subordinate and
believes the mission will start for Berlin
to-morrow.

Glare of Beast.
PANTHER'S EYES
DO AWFUL WORK
The young lady was taken - into her
father's â¢ house and tenderly cared for.
She hovered .between life and death for
several weeks and finally began to mend.
As soon as Â¦: she could be moved . with
safety she was brought to Berkeley and
is -at the home- of her brother-in-law,
Winfleld S. Schmidt, ' in Peralta Park.
Here she gradually .:. regained conscious
ness,! but there is a month gone from her
mind and the time from the moment that
she thought > the panther was about to
spring. until she woke up in Berkeley is a
complete blank.
Miss- Wagner" has since told her.story
in bits.!' She Is not allowed to talk much
about it, for when she "recalls the terror
that she f elt ; at that moment she lapses
again Â¦ into unconsciousness. Dr. Miner,
who .'is attending, the youngs lady, says
that her condition : Is . unusual because . of
the length of ' her unconsciousness, and
that.it was due to-extreme fright. He
said to-day : ,'..' "Miss .Wagner's . condition
was undoubtedly caused by the fright the
glaring: panther gave 1 her.- The: weather
was; very warm and she was ; debilitated
by. her. studies â¢ here, and these two things
helped, of course to bring her. to her pres
ent > state.'- ; Fright, however, . ia .without
doubt the main cause of her illness. Her
condition is improvine.'.' Â¦
Miss., Wagner was unable to say what
had happened * and the only Â¦ theory that
the family could evolve Â¦ was that she
had suffered from sunstroke 'â¢ and had
fallen from her horse, for there was no
other way .to account for the torn cloth
ing -' and bruised body. This , was ex
plained a few days ago when she first
began to .talk. It was evident that after
she lost consciousness, or just as con
sciousness fled, her : horse, must have
thrown 'her from its back, and yet in her
delirium she in some manner regained
her mount, and clinging to the animal's
neck was taken back home by the
horse, whose instinct urged him to his
stable. - Â¦ "â¢â¢.." Â¦ â¢ Â¦
tells now of the glare of. the eyes as it
stood there. The animal seemed to know
that the girl was unarmed and she says
that while she was so greatly frightened
at its appearance that when it did not
retreat but prepared to spring she be
came so terror stricken that she almost
lost all consciousness. She, saw only the
glare . of the eyeballs as the . panther
crouched to spring, and she tried to urge
her horse . forward. After that every
thing was a blank.
Â¦When the horse came galloping into
the mine stable the girl was clinging to
its back.- She was â¢ unconscious and
frothing at tht mouth," while her,cloth
ing was torn and her body was bruised
as if she had fallen from her horse. Â¦

None of the steel officials would discuss
the matter. Shaffer declared to-night
that the strike, in spite of the claims of
the other side to the contrary,. is proceed
ing satisfactorily and that his association
is making such inroads upon the corpora
tion's business that it will be compelled
sooner or later to come to terms. . His
men, he says, are firm all along the line,
and are determined to stand Â¦. for their
rights to the end. He says the few mills
th&t have been started are doing little
effective work. The- fact that the cor
poration Is adding to its force daily does
not worry the president. He believes
them to be either unskilled or poortwork

sources is that the strike can now be set
tled only by the men going back to the
mills. The position the officials take, It
is said, is that the strike is over so far as
their dealing with the strikers as a body
is concerned.
Notwithstanding the well- denned posi
tion taken by the steel corporation as to a
settlement, another arbitration scheme
was launched this evening by Simon
Burns, president of the Window Glass
Workers' Association. Burns proposes
an arbitration committee selected from
among such men as Archbishop Ireland,
Bishop Potter, Seth Low and others
of like prominence, who, after â¢> hav
ing the entire matter' explained to
them by both sides to the controversy,
shall have absolute authority to decide
upon terms of settlement, their decision to
bo final and accepted by both parties. â¢
. Burns says he has President Shaffer's
sanction for the move, and if the corpora
tion will agree to the plan the strike will
be declared off at once.
"Â¦Wheels "Within Wheels" as presented
by Daniel Frohman's Company is proving
an attractive bill at the Columbia Thea
ter. Hilda Spong,- in the Uadlng role, is
seen to splendid advantage. The entire
cast is well fitted. The final performance
by this company will take place on Satur-
tin plate company's avowed intention of
breaking away from the union entirely,
President Shaffer of the Amalgamated
Association said. . .
"Mefistofele" and "II Trovatore". have
again been filling the Tivoli from ground
floor to roof and the performances are as
satisfying as ever. The first named opera
has been a splendid innovation in opera
productions at this house, and the fact
that this magnificent work can be given
at prices within the reach of all has been
taken full advantage* of. Dado, Agostini
and Montanari have all been heard at
their best, and Collamarinl, Castellano
and Barbareschi, not forgetting Salassa,
have given the Verdi favorite in fine style.
Next week comes "Norma" and \ "Mig
non."
The last week of the Frawley engage
ment at the Grand Opera-house is given
over to "Lord and Lady Algy," in which
Mr.. Frawley in particular finds a congen
ial role. To-night every lady attending
the performance will be presented with
Mr. Frawley's photograph as a farewell
gift, each portrait bearing the actor-man
ager's signature.
Next week Joseph Haxvorth, the veteran
actor, will appear in "Rosedale," the first
starring production of a brief season at
the Grand Opera-house. Mr. Haworth's
reputation on the legitimate stage is too
well known to need mention and "Rose
dale" is one of his best plays..
shank Julia Dean has one of her
happiest " opportunities and is the bright
and. particular star of the cast. ' Mr. Neill
Is. perhaps .not at his best as Sir-- Jasper
Thorndyke. but with the rest of the com
pany gives a very, pleasing interpretation
of the pretty play. John W. Burton, as
Captain Cruickshank, does an. excellent
sketch of the peppery old gentleman. On
Sunday night one of the less well-known
plays by Oscar Wilde will be presented,
"An Ideal Husband."
THE dainty and charming romance,
"Rosemary," is the week's excel
lent attraction at the California
Theater. As. Dorothy Cruick-
ST. LOUIS, Aug. 28.â Injunction pro
ceedings against the Delmar Jockey Club
were instituted in the Cirtuit Court this
afternoon by the State at the instance of
Attorney General Crow. The petition
asks that the club, Its officers and direc
tors and agents be enjoined temporarily
from making books, selling pools, making
wagers or bets or registering bets on
races run at the Delmar track by virtue
of certain licenses numbering from 446 to
460. which are alleged to be fraudulent.
The petition asks that the temporary in
junction be made permanent after a final
hearing and that the defendant be ordered
to deliver their licenses to the Clerk of
the Court . for . cancellation.

TOOK THE MONEY ON
EASTERN RACECOURSES
Following the Governor's statement the
debate on the concluding paragraph of
Â¦the resolution began in earnest and for an
hour furnished the excitement of the con
vention. The speeches were marked by
much bitterness and Governor Savage was
not spared. While his action was warm
ly defended by a number, who credited
him with only the best motives, the con
vention placed the stamp of disapproval
on the parole, and by a vote of 998 to 167,
adopted the njatform as a whole. The
convention then adjourned. â¢ â¢
The action of Governor Savage in parol
ing from the penitentiary former State
Treasurer Joseph S. .Hartley furnished, as
Â¦was expected, the only real excitement of
the convention. An effort to dispose of
the vexed question of an indorsement or
disapproval 01 the Governor's action out
side the convention failed. Supporters of
the Governor did succeed in naving all
resolutions referred to the committee 011
platform without debate, but the commit
tee itself reported in turn against the pa
role and,- while not impugning the mo
tives of the Governor, uemanaed the re
turn of the ex-Treasurer to the peniten
tiary, and was sustained by the conven
tion. On the Bartley parole the platform
says:
-The. Republicans of Nebraska disclaim
for the party any sympathy with cus
todians of public money found guilty of
the betrayal of sacred trusts. Witnout
impugning the motives of the Governor in
any way, we deprecate any exercise of
executive clemency tending to create the
false impression that the Republican
party is disposed to condone the unlawful
embezzlement of public funds under any
circumstance, and we request the imme
diate recall of the parole granted to Jo
seph S. Bartley by the Governor."
Before action was taken on the report the
privilege was asked and granted the Gov
ernor to make a statement. The Governor
explained at length hig reason for grant
ing a parole to Bartley. He reminded the
convention that he alone was responsible
and that if he had erred in his act of
clemency to a man convicted of embezzle
ment the fault must rest with himself and
not with the Republican party of tho
State.

When the Hyatts returned at 7 o'clock
they found Mis3 Henderson lying in the
yard in a pool of her own blood and unr
conscious from a bullet wound in the
head. She had been assaulted and shot.
The bullet had entered the back of her
heaÂ«i and came out at the forehead. She
was revived enough to say that "Bossie"
had entered the house about 6 o'clock and
grabbing her by the neck from behind, be
gan to choke her. She had jumped out of
the open window to escape, had been fol
lowed by the negro and shot.
The murder of Miss Henderson was one
of the most cold-blooded ever perpetrated
in Johnson County. The fact that it oc
curred in the country made its commis
sion easier and escape of the murderer
simpler. Miss Henderson was the twin
sister of Mrs. W. C. Hyatt and lived at
the home of Mr. and Mrs. Hyatt, a few
miles 1 out of Columbus, which is oft the
railroad and forty miles south of Kansas
City. Hyatt, who la a well-known Here
ford breeder and formerly was a promi
nent Populist politician, and his wife had
left Miss Henderson alone in the after
noon while they went to the cemetery
near the town to superintend the building
of a monument. Miss Henderson and
"Bossie" Francis, the negro, were the
oi>ly persons on the premises.
Bud Francis, brother of the murderer,
took to the woods after the discovery of
the crime. He was seen to-day near Cen
terview and when caught will be strung
up, members of the posse say. and com
pelled to tell what he knows of his
brother's whereabouts. Members of a
negro family named Briscoe, living near
the Hyatt farm, are believed to know
something of the murderer's flight and
pressure will be applied to make them tell.
When the men of the family were ques
tioned to-day Mrs. Briscoe told them to
say nothing. It is believed Francis passed
the Briscoe place after the murder.
KANSAS CITY, Aug. 2S.â "Bossie"
Francis, the negro who assaulted and
murdered Miss Mary Henderson at Co
lumbus, Mo., last night, has not yet been
captured, 1 but four or five hundred men â¢
are to-night scouring the woods in the
vicinity of the scene of the crime and it is f
stated that Francis cannot escape. It is
not known whether he fled on horseback
or on foot, but the pursuit wa3 begun so
soon after the discovery of the crime that
every outlet from the country was closed
promptly.
Francis had ! always lived about Colum
bus, knows every. foot of territory there
abouts and is more likely to hide In the
brush than to flee to a strange district.
The vines and weeds along the creek beds
are very tall and tangled and afford good
shelter. The volunteers will hunt all
night and will be relieved by others to
morrow. Bloodhounds were sought last
night but -were not obtainable while the -
trail was fresh. Dogs are now on the
trail. Francis will undoubtedly be lynched '
if caught. -
Edgar May, a clerk in the office of the

ADVERTISEMENTS.x FEDERAL EMPLOYE WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE WHILE TEMPORARILY
INSANE AND THE YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE TRAGIC DEATH SEV
ERAL. YEARS AGO IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE.
"Thrasher said Tuesday that he would
kill himself and put an end to it all. I
thought he didn't mean it and that 1 he
was only Joking. He was very Jealous
and did not want me to go out alone, not
even 'with girls, for he was afraid that I
would meet someone. I first met
Thrasher at the French .ball at the
Chutes. I had been his companion since
down the stairs I met the landlord coming
up. He could not find a key to fit the
door, so. I put my weight against It and
pushed it in. When I entered vthe room
Thrasher was all but gone.
The young man's body was . removed
from the Morgue yesterday and taken to
an undertaking parlor. Thrasher's father
is not at present in Milwaukee, but it is
expected that telegrams will reach him
some time to-day. It is supposed that he
will order the body embalmed and sent
East for interment.
Thrasher, according to a story told . by
some of his friends, had been melancholy
and despondent since the death of Miss
Mildred Clarke, who committed Â¦ suicide
several years ago, while temporarily in
sane. He had known the young lady from
childhood and it was. believed by some
that they. were engaged to be married.
Thrasher left two letters for Collector
of Â¦ Internal Revenue Lynch. They were
only official reports, ho waver/ and threw
no light on the suicide. Collector Lynch
when seen yesterday said that he could
assign no reason for the suicide, unless it
was Illhealth. Thrasher was not well and
was afraid that he had contracted con
sumption.
that time. He said that hÂ© intended to
marry me, and -would do ' so when, he
should get a location outside of San Fran
cisco. My folks did not know of the re
lation I bore to Thrasher. I was not going
to leave Thrasher because I had ceased
to care for him. I thought the world of
him, but he was jealous and quarrelsome
all the time and I couldn't stand it."

There was a delay In the performance
of thÂ© Ringlingr Brotners' circus last
night, which, although slight, was suffi
cient to be noticeable to the 15,000 people
who crowded the mammoth tent. A loiig
lost brother was found among the per
formers and the meeting between the
members of the family was a happy one.
Jules Tunour, a clown, and Milly Tun
our, one of the star aerial performers of
the circus, found that Monsieur Bertrand
was a member of their family. The meet
ing of the trio was as startling as it was
unexpected. When Miss Tunour had con
cluded her perilous act on, the swinging'
trapeze she bowed to the Immense . au
dience and ran to her dressing-room. As
she was passing Monsieur Bertrand, who
was about to enter the arena with other
clowns, he exclaimed. "C'est charmant."'
The phrase was a familiar one to Miss
Tunour. Her father had often used it to
express his approval of her act and the
became interested. When Bertrand re
turned to the dressing-room she told him
that her father often used the expression.
He in turn said his parent had often an
proved him in the same manner. Aft^r
a brief conversation it developed that they
were brother and sister and Jules Tunour
was called in to join in the reunion.

for many years. He went away with
some English acrobats and lost track of
his family, who were also traveling per

"Walker was arrested in the fall, of 1897
and after conviction was sentenced by
Judge Wallace on February 6, 1898, to
four years In State's Prison. A | motion
for a new trial was denied and an appeal
was taken. The defendant's counsel took
advantage of every means by which liti
gation might be continued and the months
drifted on without important develop
ments until September 30, 1898, when
Judge Wallace stayed all proceedings.
- From that time until June 9, 1899, Walker
was forgotten In the County Jail. Judge
Dunne then ordered that the original
sentence be executed. An appeal to the
Supreme Court gained a new trial for the
prisoner. A few weeks ago he was again
arraigned, and, following a conviction,
was sentenced by Judge Dunne to a year
at San Quentln. The attempt to stay pro
ceedings by petition to the Supreme Court
has failed and nothing more can be clone
by Walker except to serve his sentence/

THE suicide of Luther A. Thrasher,
gauger in the Internal revenue
service, was the -chief topic of
conversation yesterday among
Federal cfficials. An inquest was
held and the jury brought In a verdict
that Thrasher "came to his death through
a gunshot wound of brain, self inflicted
while temporarily insane."
Miss Jessie MacDonald of 25 Tilden
street, with whom Thrasher had been on
very friendly terms, visited the Morgue
early yesterday/ morning and told what
she knew of the suicide. She said that
Thrasher came to his room at 2 o clock
1 Tuesday afternoon from Oakland, wliere
he had been working. He began to quar
rel with her. i He said that she was get
ting tired of him and treating him mean,
end he thought he had better not go with
her any more. After that he began to
dress to go out to. dinner.
"He called me over to him," said she,
"and asked me if I really meant to give
him up. I said it was just as well, as we
were always quarreling and couldn't get
along. Then I went out to comb my hair,
and I heard the shot. I thought then that
he was onlx fooling, but when I went
back to the room I found him lying back
Congressman Hull speaks advisedly and
with knowledge when he speaks of nur
soldiers. He himself served with distinc
tion through the Civil War and has a son
â¢who was a ma.ior on the staff of General
MacArthur and who has but lately re
turned to this city after two years' hard
fighting in those same Islands which his
father now regards with so much en
thusiasm.
"If I was a young 1 man I don't know
where I would rather go than to the Phil
ippines. Fcr,-a man of brains and indus
try the islands open a vast prospect in
most every line of business for one who
. has the gTit to go there and stick to it.
Our own country has been going through
a hundred years of internal development.
It has been traversed with railways from
one end to the other. All the arable lands
are taken up and being developed and It
Â«D1 not be long before we will have to
find some outlet for our overflow. With
the construction of the Nicaragua canal,
which work I expect will be completed
â¢within the next fifty years, Cuba. Porto
Rico, the Hawaiian Islands. Guam and
the Philippines will be brought very near
to all of our markets, and America will
become the mistress of the commerce of
all the seas, as she is already the mistress
of the commerce of the Pacific.
Pays Tribute to American Soldiers.
"I am glad I went to the Philippines, for
the trip has shown me how little the peo
ple of This country really know concern
ing the possibilities of the possessions
they talk so much about. I would sug
gest that every member of Congress take
a like journey and acquaint himself
with thlnprs across the seas. It would he
of Inestimable benefit to him. A tour
of personal observation would be of much
benefit to the islands as well."
Congressman Hull concluded by paying
a hlgrh tribute to the American soldier
as he has seen him both in the Philip
pines and returning from his campaign
in China. He regretted that he was a
day too late to participate in the Ptrry
monument ceremonies in Janan. but ex
pressed himself as filled with admiration
at the progTPssiveness of that country
and the wonderful strides forward it hail
made since the famous American com
modore first visited there.
"Of course, we will have to govern them
with firmness as well as with kindness.
I think that 40.000 troops is about the
right number to keep there for some years
to come.
"Of course It Is Impossible to mako an
Anglo-Saxon out of an Oriental, therefore
the Filipino will probably never be an
American citizen in the broad sense that
Is understood by all that term conveys to
the man born in the United States of
white parents. But as soon as he gets suf
ficient education and becomes a little more
impregnated with our ideas and loses
some of the ideas acquired by a three hun
dred year association with the Spaniard
the Filipino will be a citizen in spirit, pa
triotism, industry and education and will
be worthy of participating to the fullest
extent in all the benefits of this Govern
ment. ,
In speaking of his observation last
night Hull said that he did not think that
the Filipinos were at present fitted for
admission to citizenship, It would only
be necessary for one generation to grow
up under peaceful conditions, however, to
so materially change the existing state of
affairs that the applicants will be qualified
to participate in the privileges of Ameri
can citizenship.
"The Filipinos are a wonderful people,
said Congressman Hull, "and their islands
are veritable mines of richness. The
mineral, agricultural and timber resources
of these new possessions of ours consti
tute a field for commercial enterprise that
Is practically unlimited. Of course, the
present conditions of brigandage make It
exceedingly unsafe for people to settle in
the islands away from the protection of
the military posts. The formation of the
country and the almost impregnable fast
nesses of the mountains make the hunt
ing down of these brigands an exceedingly
difficult task. But the people, or the great
majorityâ nine out of ten of themâ desire
peace and safety and are doing all they
can to help the troops attain this end.
Consequentlv it will not be a great many
years before one can travel in safety
through the greater part of all the islands.

When the store was opened yesterday
morning evidence of the burglary made
Itself manifest on all sides. Show cases
containing articles of value were opened
and emptied, while ! others with cheaper
goods were despoiled only of the more ex

Further investigation showed that the
thieves, who had evidently taken their
time in completing their work, had
broken Â¦ into the cash register. Rather
than ring the bell in opening it they forced
it with a Jimmy only to find It empty.
From a small . yard In : the rear of the
store the men sawed away one of the iron
bars that served as a guard for the win
dow and by, -wrenching it out of place left
a space : big enough to crawl through.
Once inside the. thieves put on some hunt
ers' game coats and filled the pockets with
knives, scissors and razors. Fishing bas
kets were pressed Into service and' loaded
with the booty. A valuable Winchester
rifle and a shotgun were taken. Two re
