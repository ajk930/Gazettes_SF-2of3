China '.that 'any sucn - surrender of ; terri
tory would be disapproved." 7" " . â¢' Â¦ i
On the"' third -reading of : the ,'appropria- 
tlon bill In the House of Commons a dis
cussion of Chinese affairs was raised; and
Lord â¢ Cranborne ' referred members to
Lord Lansdown's; statement in the House
Of Lords. He added:
If the document rcallv fell within the
language used by Count Lamsdorff. I his
Majesty's Government would certainly
not object to 4t. Untii these uncertain
ties were removed Great Britain could
not do- otherwise than adhere to" the view
that it was desirable that China, ,at a
time when she was negotiating with [ the
whole of the . powers, should ' simul
taneously enter into a ortvate and separ
ate arrangement involving the territorial
and financial conditions with another
power. - That was . the , language that the
Government had used to China and It was
â¢almost precisely j the language which had
been used by .. the German Government.
His Majesty's Government would be tena
clous in matters of principle. In matter
of detail they i realized they, must not al
ways ' expect ' to havo their own way.
They would use their best" endeavors to
bring the present^ negotiations' to a close
and to eliminate a situation which was In
convenient and fraught with danger to all
concerned In the' negotiations.
. REGRETS THE MYSTERY, v
FRAUGHT WITH BANGER,
. Count Lamsdorff. the Russian Minister
of Foreign Affairs; had, however, in
formed the British s^Embassador at St.
Petersburg that it -1 v.as the purpose of
Russia' to arrange r. modus vlvendl with
China with the object of preventing dis
turbances In tho .vicinity of the Russian
frontier and that sho had no intention of
seeking that guarantee in any acquisition
of territory or in any actual or virtual
protectorate over Manchuria.
The* British Minister at Peking had
been Instructed to be moderate In his de
mands, and the Government only desired
to strengthen the guards sufficiently to
insure the safety of the legations. In
regard to the question of Indemnity now
tinder discussion. It had been decided
that the claims should be forwarded by
the powers In one lot As to the source
whence tho Indemnity should be paid It
was not desired to impose on China any
crushing burden. To do so would be con
trary to the policy of the British Gov
ernment, â¢which policy was to respect the
existence of China as a. 'power. He did
not dcrpair of seeing China reformed.
The people possessed many good qualities.
Both the British and .German govern
ments had Informed China that it way
not desirable, while negotiating with the
powers as a. whole, that ehe should enter
Into a. private arrangement Involving ter
ritorial or financial conditions with. any
other pewer. Russia had again assured
Great Britain that tba occupation of the
British railway was only temporary and,
China. Negotiations were necessarily
slow with the refuge* Government. On
the broad questions, however, there was
a. practical unanimity among the powers.
The allies had agreed they were not at
war with China and desired to derive no
territorial advantage from * the present
events. They also recognized the binding
nature of the existing treaties &ad de
sired to maintain the open door in com
mercial and economical questions, 'while
within the spheres where existed prefer
ential rights there^Ehould be equality cf
opportuclty for all the powers concerned.
TO Tf ATT-R MODERATE DEMANDS.
LONDON. March 2S.â In the House of
Lords to-day Lord Lansdowne, the For
eign Secretary, announced that no further
military operations by the British troops
In China were contemplated for the pres
ent. When Field Marshal Count von Wal
dersee recently ordered preparations for
the recent expedition the Foreign Secre
tary Eald the British Government in
structed General Gasclce to communicate
â¢with the home Government, before partici
pating therein. The compliance of China
with the demands of the powers is hardly,
cf eucfc a character as to Justify the with
drawal of the allied forces, but the Brit
ish Government hoped to be able before
long to withdraw or reduce Its forces In
"Nothing would give us greater pleas
ure than to co-operate with the , Russian
Government In; opposing such - an un
worthy object. If Russia would only, by
communicating the real text of the agree
ment, enable Great Britain to put an end
to thifi misconception, we should be-pre
pared co-operate with her/! <
What militated against any hopes had
been' the' mystery- in which the-negotia
tions have been Involved throughout. ,

was in the nature of . a modus vlveridl.
It was suggested that the Versions of the
treaty, published' were simply trial bal

Inventions desired to bring about a mis
understanding, lie added : â¢

In regard to the reported Manchurian
agreement Lord Lansdowne - said he was
not In. a position to- pass final opinion on
the matter. The Government would not

Lord Lansdowne. referring to the Anglo-
German agreement, said that when- this
was being negotiated the German Govern
ment gave Great Britain to understand
In the German view Manchuria was not a
place where they considered they had any
influence. He thought, however,. that the
point did not deserve too much attention,
pointing out that the only two treaty
ports in Manchuria were Nluchwang and
lalienwan. with regard to which explicit
assurances had been given by" Russia.'
Lord'l^ansdowne said he had seen'news
paper reports suggesting that Count von
Bulow. the German Imperial Chancellor,
had Interpreted the agreement 'differently
from Great Britain, tut the point did not
seem vital because all the powers, includ
ing Germany, had -repeatedly declared
that their policy was to maintain the In
tegrity of China.
without prejudice to the interests In
volved. Great Britain had not waived her
rights in connection with theso railroads;
nor had she ignored the interests of the
shareholders. As to sources . of revenue,
he thought the maritime customs might
be readjusted so as to Impose a real"in
stead of a nominal 5 per eent advalorem
duty. Certain free articles ought to be
subjected to duty, but caution was neces
sary, lest the Interests of British com
merce be damaeed.

REVOLUTIONARY RISING
Weiland's Attack Thought to Have Been
Cause for His Telling Alexander Guards
to Hold Themselves Ready.
(Continued from Page One.)
BERLIN. March 28.â Emperor William.
In the course of a speech to the Alexander
regiment In the courtyard of the bar
racks, said, according to the Kreuz Zei
tung. that his hearers must be ready day
and night to act as the bodyguard of their
King and give their lifeblood If necessary
for the Emperor and his house-
Calling to mind the events of 1848, his
Majesty Gald that if such days should
come again the regiment would certainly
repress all insubordination or misconduct
against the King. ,
Amazement is everywhere expressed at
the Emperor's strong hints to a possible
revolutionary rising and of street fights
Â¦with the troops. Well informed circles
*ee in his Majesty's deliverance further
proof that the attack on him by Weiland
at Bremen has very seriously affected his
views and attitude toward the German
people.
The versions cf the speech differ widely.
A number of the papers this evening do
not print a word of It, and these include
the entire eeml^offlcial press. The Lokal
Anzeiger's version, which Is the longest,
makes the Emperor say some very ex-
treme things. . The account published by
the Tageblatt contains also some very se
vere passages. The Boersen Courier prints
another version, stHl more strongly em
phasizing the Emperor's wish that the
new barracks should serve as a fortress
for the protection of tho castle. Other
papers, like the Kreuz Zeitung, publish a
weaker version. But the fact is that not
a single newspaper man was present when
the address was delivered, as none were
admitted to the courtyard. All the ver
sions were based upon subsequent ac
counts furnished by spectators other than
newspaper men, or by the friends of such,
but they tally substantially. r
The Fresslnnlgo Zeitung, which Is the
only paper commenting upon the address
this evening, eays:
"Emperor William had no reason to talk
about revolution and the like, because
Weiland's deed was the act of an irre
sponsible epileptic. Moreover, his Majes
ty forgets that the revolution of 1S48 wag
part of a general uprising throughout the
whole of Germany."
This paper also critifipes the reply of
the regimental commander, who called the
Bremen attempt a "bestial crime."" To
morrow's -press comment throughout Ger
many will intensify. the- situation.

,flrst went there hurt the pride of the Filipinos. If we
had made a greater effort to flatter them it is possible
the thing would have gone more smoothly, but I wish
to say that at tho beginning I don't believe Aguinaldo
had any idea of independence at all. They simply, hated
the Spaniards. They hated them, I say, and they want
ed to get rid. of th'em in any way possible. They looked
upon us as their deliverers and they did anything we
told them to. Afterward I think It was simply, a case
of success turning a man's head in the case of Aguinal
do. I don't believe that at first he had any ', idea of at
tempting to set up an independent republic." .
The foregoing were the significant words "uttered by Ad
miral Dewey to-day when interviewed as to the probable effect
of the capture of Aguinaldo. Continuing, he said: .
"As to the matter -of ; our relations'- with the Filipinos, .the
history has never yet been .written. I have all the letters and
documents pertaining to it, and I expect some day to write the
history of the affair. When all of the documents are published
It -will be perfectly clear that no obligation rested upon the
American forces to treat tha Filipinos as allies.
i "Agulnaldo was always a most amicable man, and person
ally I would net wish him the slightest harm,' but I believe, as'
I said, that his capture means the end of organized resistance.
â¢ "I am delighted to hear news of Agulnaldo's capture. Of
course we had the warning a few days ago that it might occur,
but it looked like a ' very risky undertaking, and if. Funston
had lost his life every one would have said .'I told you so." It
appears to be a. very creditable piece of work on the part of
Funston and invkeeping with his previous exploits. -It was,* in
fact, a case of fighting the devil with fire. If a large foreÂ© had
gone against Aguinaldo he would not have been found, but this
was a kind of strategy of their own kind and appears to have
succeeded, perfectly. â¢ . " - - â¢Â¦* -"Â¦ *
â¢ "Agulnaldo does not have the education with which he has
been credited, and he was not really the brains of the insur
rection. Mablnl was really the brains of the Filipino rebellion,
and Aguinaldo was the active leader. I admit I did- not give
him credit for the abilities that he has shown, -but he is cer
tainly not a man of very great ability. One- thing I wonder
about is that the dispatches to-day from Manila describe him
as 'talking freely.' When Ifiist saw him he was notably reti
cent and a good deal of his strength came from, the fact that
he did not - talk much. ;The . people believed he was invulner
able, however,- and that no harm could be done to him. There
was a story current, in fact, that a dozen men had stood up
and fired at him as a test. I suppose there were no bullets* in
tho Runs.'- That story went everywhere. The- people are in
; tensely superstitious and .they -believed that no . harm cculd
befall him. It will take some time now for the news of his
capture to become', circulated, and the' first report will be
doubted, but when they are convinced of It. I believe that or
franlzed resistance will collapse. Â¦Â¦;â¢- Of > course there will be
sporadic disorder for. a long time to come, but I do not believe
that there will be anything- serious." >* ? â¢ Â¦-. '
"What do i you think ought to be done. with' Apuinaldo?"
' "Well, it seems to me that as good a thing as could be done
for the present would-be to send him to Guam. It Is the came
sort of a climate as the Philippines, and there will- be no hard
ship in the change, but there would be no chance to pose."

surrendered without resistance.
When captured Aguinaldo
was tremendously excited, .but
he calmed down under General
Funston's assurance that he
would be well treated.
General Funston secured all
of Aguinaldo's correspondence,
showing that he had kept in close
touch with the sub-chiefs of the
insurrection in all parts . of the
archipelago. It .was discovered
that Aguinaldo January 28 had
proclaimed himself dictator. He
had been living at Paranan for
seven months undisturbed ex

Sixteenth Infantry visited the
town. On that occasion the en
tire population took to the 1

until the troops retired. .

had come near to being captured
before, but he .asserted that he
had never been wounded, add

He feared he might 'be sent to
Guam, and he was quite glad to
come to Manila.
Paranan was guarded by
numerous outposts and signal
stations. During the fight none
of the Maccabebes were
wounded. â¢

Kxcept that it' makes no reference to the

dispatch covers the â¢ whole field of gossin
and epeculation excited in Washington by
the news that Funston's adventurous ex
pedition had been crowned with complete
success. The. cablegram follows:
"MANILA. -March 28.â Adjutant Gen
eral. Important messages
ffll into the bands of General Funston on
February. 28, from which Agulnaldo was
located at Paranan. Isabella province. An
expedition was organized, consisting of
Aguinaldo's captured messenger; four ex
insurgent officers and seventy-eight Maca

Mausers and Remingtons and dressed to
represent insurgents. Funston command

â¢ The officers were dressed as American
privates and represented prisoners.
"The expedition sailed -from Manila on
Ahe> 5th on the Vieksburg and landed
idarch 14 . on the cast coast of Luzon,
twenty-sex'en miles south of Caslguran.
The expedition reached Paranan. march
ing at 3. In the afternoon, on March 23."
The natives were completely misled and
supposed the detachment to be insurgent
reinforcements.- for which supplies .-w<-rÂ«
furnished. A go! naldo also sent .supplies
and had bis escort or forty meD-^araded
to extend proper honor. A short distance
from Aguinaldo's quarters disguise was
discarded. A combat followed, resulting
In two Insurgents being killed and
eighteen rifles and 1000 rounds of ammu
nition captured, together with Agulnaldo
and two principal staff officers. There
were no casualties on our side. The
splendid co-operation of the navy through
Commander Barry, his officers and men of
the vieksburg, was Indispensable to suc
cess. Funston loudly praises the navy.
The entire army joins in thanks to the
eea service.
"The transaction was brilliant in con
ception and faultless in execution. All
credit must go to Funston. who. under
the supervision of General Wheaton. or
ganized and conducted the expedition,
from start to finish. His reward should
be signal and immediate. With General
uheaton, I recommend Funston's reten
tion in the volunteers until he can be ap
pointed a brigadier general of regulars.
"I hope for a speedy cessation of hos
tilities throughout the archipelago as a
consequence of this stroke. As a result of
conferences now In probable progress
Aguinaldo will issue an address advising'
a general surrender, delivery of arms and
acceptance of American supremacy.

discussing that point 1 â¢ â¢Â¦â¢.**Â¦
As a matter of fact General MacArthifr
has full power to deal wi$h General Agui
naldo himself; but it is expected by the
officials of the War Department that he
will ask advice before taking fln^T action,:
No instructions nor advice have yef been
sent him and the question of the best
course to pursue, wi:! be the subject of
discussion at the meeting: of the Cabinet
to-morrow. . . '
It can be said on the authority of a'
member of the Cabinet, however, tnat
neither the President: nor Secretary Root
is disposed to treat General Aguinaldo
with any more severity than the situation
In the Philippines domands. He referred
to the general amn-.-sty that had been pro
claimed for all. who. would take the oath
of allegiance to the United States and
who had not been guilty of acts contrary
to the rules of civilized warfare, as in
dicating the purpose of the administration
not to inflict punishment on those who
had participated in the insurrection. Â¦
He. intimated that It might be possible
that Aguinaldo would be. speedily released .
if he. In good faith: fulfilled his promise
to General MacArthur of issuing an ad
dress advising a general surrender and
acceptance of American supremacy.
If he would work to this end it was re
garded as possible that he rajght even be
permitted to reside In Manila, and about
the harshest treatment suggested was
that he might be sent to Guam and com
pelled to reside there until such time as
the Philippines has been completely paci
fied and all danger of a revival of the In
surrection passed.
Although General Agulnaldo has not
participated in pers.-.n In any of the recent
conflicts between the insurgents and tho
American troops and although his autfior
ity over the natives has not for some timo
been as complete as at the outbreak of
thÂ« insurrection, the officials of the ad
ministration believe that his capture will
go far toward bringing armed resistance
to an end. It is believed that the capture
of Aguinaldo, who was regarded by jnany
of the natives as being under the protec
tion of some supernatural force, following
upon the aggressive operations of the
army against the Insurgents wherever,
they can be found, will have the effect of
convincing the inhabitants of the- Islands
of the futility of further resistance.
If Aguinaldo now follows this up with
an effort made In good faith to convince
his followers that It Is to their; interest
to accept amnesty :t is believed there will
be little more serious trouble in the isl

charges. Countess Russell's suit failed
and the Judge took the unusual course of
requiring her to pay its cost, amounting
to more than T25.000.. As a result of that
suit the Earl obtained a judicial separa
tion. Countess Russell, in April, 1S95, suc
cessfully sued for a restoration . of her
conjugal rights, withdrawing the charges
which she had made in her suit for di
vorce. '
John Francis Stanley, Earl Russell, was
married to Mollie Somerville, daughter of
the late George Cooke. Combernald, Scot
land, on April 11, 1900, in Reno, Nev. They
had been living for several months pre
vious in Nevada, where both had obtained
'decrees of divorce. Karl Russell obtained
a divorce from Countess Russell on the
ground of desertion. He alleged that she
had. left him nearly ten years ago. She
was Miss Maoel Kdith Scott, youngest
daughter of the late Sir Claude Edward
Scott.

strained. The first seaman. Allan, fell off
the rigging into the sea and the water
was so rough that it was impossible for a
boat to be put out to reach him.
Temporary repairs were made and the
vessel had good weather until in SI de

LUCKLESS SHIP
The strike made at the Central mine a
week ago has developed into a ledge over
two feet in size. With water rushlnjr in
at the rate of 200 gallons per minute, ex
plorations have been ver-y difficult and
the footwall has not yet been reaches.
Enough is known, however, to make it
certain that the famous North Star ledge
has been unearthed and the company
has thousands of feet of "backs" to work.
The Central has a vertical depth of lÂ«y>
feet and is the deepest mine in the county.
People here are Jubilant over the dis
covery, as the town of late has been very
dull. "Warnings should be given to miners
that there are hundreds of men In Ne
vada County out of work and new ar
rivals will stand no show of employment.
The Importance of tnis news lies In thp
fact that a story has been going tho
rounds for years that the Nevada County
ledges pinch out with depth. Four days
ago a rich strike was made in the Camp
bell mine of Nevada City, and ten days
previous another in tiie Providence.
The mine has paid fairly well at time?
In past years. It has a seventy-stamp
mill, but on account of a rather discour
aging outlook thirty of the stamps had
been shut down. These will be repaired
for immediate use. On the property also
Is a chlorination plant of large capacity,
but it is unable to handle the output of
sulphurets. Now that will be shipped to"
San Francisco.
GRASS VALLEY, March 28.â A strike
of vast richness has been made in the
Champion mine at Nevada Cltv. On the
2400-foot level a twenty-foot ledee' has
been unearthed carrying free gold and
sulphurets.

2200. FIRST RACE-Five furlongs; gelling;
four-year-olds and up; purse, $400.
BY F. E. MULHOLLAND.
THE last time Tame' Irishman
s-tarted, which was on March 21,
when he finished behind Rio Chico,
Catastrophe and Dolore In a. slow
run seven-furlong dash, C. H. Wil
liams, the horEe's owner, accused Owen
Mounco of not trylns to win. After the
last event decided at Tanforan yesterday
It must be confessed the Idaho boy. and
hin methods are difficult to decipher.
Quoted at odds of 12 and 15, Irishman,
with R. Murphy In the, saddle, worked
his .way from fourth position, until finally
at the close of the six and a half furlong
Frrint, which waa covered In 1:21^4. he
rsn in three lengths before the favorite.
Saintly. Our Lizzie, piloted by the awe
iiisplrir.p, soul bewildering, nerve racking
Milton Henry, the horseman par excel
lence of two hemispheres, receiving a sal
ary double that of any other rider on the
face of the globe." possibly excepting six,
ran a magnificent third. This day Cali
fornia will suffer an irreparable loss, for
Henry, 'tis said, will depart for New York
to report to James Ft. Keene, his employ
er. Milt has received flattering offers to
ride for the Emperor of Patasronla, the
President of Poland and the Czar of Fiji,
but prefers to linger about the great me
trcpolis, where soubrettes and the vintage
ripen over night. If Mr. Keene will only
follow Henryâ that is, back his mountsâ it
Â¦would not be Burprisinc to hear of the
veteran stock manipulator riding over the
Jumps In the near future.
Two favorites earned brackets, while an
other ran a dead heat. ,As acute depres
sion was pictured on the countenances of
the major portion of the tale-nt, victory
beyond question rested with the pencilers.
Winnie O'Connor was six times at the bat,
knocking out three home runs. Only three
were missed from the attendance of the
day btfere. and this trio, ft is understood,
has started for Nome to die for more.
Hagf-rdon, from Don Cameron's barn, Is
to all appearances a tJir.xrt sort of a horse
just now-. The bis sprinter picked up 114
pounds in the six-furlonff handicap, arvl
in the face of a stiff breeze beat out
Dandy Jim. the favorite, a length, In 1:14
flat. St. Wood ran ihird.
Oner apain were tlie judees unable to
separate two iiorses. tx> closely aligned
were they as the point wa5
crossed. In the mile soiling affair Mounce,
Utrtde Cromwell, circled his field, and !Â»
h depi>eraie drive passed the officials in
the stand on about eiuil terms with the
favorite. Opponent. At any rate, it was
*o close a dead heat was declared.
Glissando. a 15 to 1 Â»-hot ridden by J.
Daly, beat the favorite, lirenhilda, a neck
for the opening five-furlong scramble.
Tizona led to the Ftrctch. where the pres
pure told, and he fell back. The favorite
looked to be winninjr, when O'Connor
prpÂ» r gay and was nipped out. Gold
J-*inder. a 40 to 1 shot, ran third.
Pat Dunne's seldine Toah, at odds on,
FUbdued Rollick in clever fashion, de
<ampirg with the seven-furlong run, next
decided. Scallawagr. following- his usual
custorn. cut out the running for tv.o
tbirds of the distance, and then cashed in.
O'Connor then let out his wraps on the
favorite, beatinp Rollick easily. Enos on
Orafter put up a very comical ride,
thoroughly en.ioyed and appreciated by
the humorously inclined, and C. Ross,
who tried to Â»ilot\ Ada N and again sot
left, should be relegated to the messenger
service.
Jockey O'Connor followed up this win
by putting St. Anthony, a luke-warm
<-hoif t e, over the plate first for a ehoip
five-furlorp scramble. After Phlegon and
Jvinps Pal had raced themselves to a
standstill. O'Connor moved up with St.
Anthony, and, ridden out. downed the
weakly handled SoajI ot Tarsus a length.
Buck Taylor took tho .-hew.
Track K"otes.
It Is reported that Eob Smith recentiv
offered his entire stable. Including Col.
Roosevelt anj Grayfeid. to Burns &
Watorhous*? for $10,000. The firm has the
matter under consideration.
Duck Tavlor vas claimed from the third
ra^e.
Seventeen books <*ut In aeraln.
Yellowtatl' and KenSlworth meet this
isfternoon in the match race for $1000 a

Tame Irishman is by ro means a con-
Flstent performer, and possibly botb
nwnpr and jockey are blameless for his
previous poor run.
Henry is a most capable ilder. and it is
to be hoped he will give his work closer
attention in the East.

New Steamships for Coast Trade.
Two new steamships for the Pacific
roast trade are now loading at Baltimore
for San Francisco. They were built on
;he great lakes by the same people who
pent out the Keewenaw and Mackinaw
and were floated down the St. Lawrence
in sections. They are named Asuncion and
Paraguay and are each of 1323 tons net,
or about TOO tons smaller than the Mack
inaw. The latter has always been used
as a collier, and the chances are that will
hp the trade the Asuncion and Paraguay
will engage in.
Besides these, it Is said, four more of
the. same kind of- steamships will come
here. Two cf them will be tho Pleiades
arn Eureka, the capacity of each of which
will be about 3500 tons gross, or the same
nass of vessels as the Asuncion and Para

I towboat Rescue has pone perma-
I nently into the oil trade. For
11 many months past she has been
' towing the oil barge Santa Paula
between Ventura and San Francisco, but
a "Redstack" captain and crew handled
the vessel. Now, however, the Union Oil
Company has taken control cf the vessel
and Captain P. Nielsen Is in command.
The Kt-scue is now being remodeled,
while tho ganta Paula is laid up in Oak
land Creek. The lug is being changed
from a coal burner into an oil burner.
Two tanks, capable of holding 3000'gal
lons of j>etroleum each, have been placed
on the deck amidships and the furnao*-s
are being: changed so as to burn the oil.
The tanks will contain enough fuel to run
the> tuc six days.* but should the supply
pive out at any time there will always be
enough coal in the bunkers to carry her
elor.g fcr another six days. The Rescue
will be fitted throughout with electric
lights, so that the only place oil will be
burntd wiU be in the furnaces.
The Rescue Is the first San Francisco
tug to be fitted out to use oil as fuel. The
tug Falcon has been using petroleum for
pern* time, and the oil steamer George
Loomis has been using It ever since she
vas built. Oil as fuel will mean a big
f avlng in the running of the Rescue. At
Ventura she can take enough aboard to
carry her to San Francisco and back
i*ra:n. The run down can be made in
forty-eight hours, while the trip up will
take sixty hours.

EEGULABS ARE BEING SENT
â¢ TO REPLACE VOLUNTEERS
The outspoken representative* of that
element of the Republican party of San
Franclscc known to politicians and states
men as the "push", are not satisfied with
Governor Gage's .selection of a Harbor
Commissioner to succeed Major P. J. Har
ney. Colonel John.C. Klrkpatrlck, man
ager of the Sharon estate hotel property,
is. -In their judgment, well fitted for or
namental service on the staff of the com
mander In chief, of the military forces of
the State and likewise* well; suited for
service on the Yosemlte Valley Commis
sion, ; but' for water, front duty he is not
to their liklns:. .
The impression In the minds of the stal
warts that Colonel Klrkpatrlck was a
Democrat. when he was appointed to the
Yosemite Commission and subsequently
became a Silver Republican and finally a
sound-money champion is not correct in
sequence.
â¢ On his return from thÂ© country yester
day Colonel Kirkpatrick replied to ; in
quiries concerning his political sentiments,
asserting iat once that he was a straight
out Republican and that he had never
been identified with tho Silver Republican
party.
This declaration may satisfy the busi
ness Â¦ men and the leaders of the party,
who care more for principle than for
i spoils, tut it will not hush the cry of the
push. There is a vast field of patronage
on tho water, front, and hundreds of the
rank and file north and south of Market
street hive been waiting with some de
pree of patience for the retirement of
Major Harney and tho enthronement of
a practical Republican politician as his
successor. When the workers heard that
Colonel Kirkpatrick. manager of the Pal
ace Hotel, had been chosen, there was a
wail of despair. -.â¢_Â¦. -
. A stateman profoundly gifted in political
wisdom observes that every appointment
Is good as long as the one making it is
in power, but the torchbearers "and tho
club hustlers cannot. take this philosoph
ical view of the subject. In the estimation
of the push a good Harbor Commissioner
la one that stands ready to give the
patronage of the water front to the peo
ple who voted and shouted for Gage In
1898 and repeated the performance for Me-
Kinlev In 1000. Colonel Klrkpatrlck may
be loyal, just and patriotic, but to the
push he is out of sight and inaccessible.

sician, was called. ' and -with one dose of hN
tea stopped the flow of blood, thereby savin;
my life, as I had been given up by. my whttÂ«
physician, as well as by all' my friends. Was
unconscious four weeks, but by Dr. Won* Woo' 9
wonderful skill he saved my life from this moat

my bed three months, was able to resume my
vocation in six months from the time I went to
bed. and now I weigh 203 pounds, more than I *
had ever attained previously: Â¦. I would cheer-

WORKING IN SILENCE.
Q" ENATOR MORGAN just before leaving Wash-
ington addressed to the editor of the Marion
(Alabama) Standards letter upon the subject
of regro disfranchisement, which has been recently
made public. It announced a policy of action and a
method of conducting: the campaign against the suf
frage of the black man that- merit the attention of
the whole country. The' Senator declares himself in
fevor of disfranchising the negro, but urges silence on
the subject. He argues that the general scheme for
suppressing the colored' vote is being, rapidly carried
out and that an agitation of the question would be
more likely to retard than to advance the movement.
His own words are worth noting. After stating:
"Since I saw you the whole country has made a 'great
and rapid advance in the direction of negro dis
franchisement," he goes on to say: "The apportion
ment bill and the counting of the electoral .vote,, with
out the question being raised as : to the constitution
ality of the Presidential election -in Louisiana and
Mississippi; is a' distinct victory for white suffrage.
Maryland has seen her opportunty and has hastened
to profit by it When things are coming our way
there is no necessity for clamorous discussion until
'they .are settled, lest some one might interrupt. So I
think the least said is the best just' now on the negro
question* Those people will begin to draw off to the
Philippines at an early date. They are already 'going
to Hawaii, and we shall soon find room for white
people in the South. Then we shall be a free and
happy people. When the time arrives I will elaborate
these views, but; at present it is better not to~discuss
them. We should take a lesson from the Cubans and
discuss the negro question with closed doors in our
convention. The silent progress we are making is
very encouraging." .
The silent progress" made toward the total.suppres
sion of the negro vote in, the South has indeed been
remarkable, and the silence has; been as . remarkable
as the progress. Here and there it js true a. voice of
protest has : been heard. . Upon many occasions The
Call has pointed out^the extent to which the negro
in several States has .been, deprived of his constitu
tional rights, and some of .the nibre â¢ influential papers
in the East have also spoken out; but the issue has
never." been 'taken' up -.by the general public with any
thing like the earnestness it deserves. Congress has
dene nothing,and as Senator Morgan says the South
era States have been encouraged to go forward [with
Ihc scheme, until now even a border. State like 1 Mary
land has felt free to follow. 1 "the Mississippi plan."
Such beingthecase v Senator Morgan is astute if
not wise inVdvising "silence. He is quite right in as
serting: "When .thingsfare coming our way, 1 there. is
no necessity for clamorous .discussion." He is

LfJWS AND CORPORATIONS.
RECENTLY the New Jersey Senate passed a bill
amending, the corporation laws in that Stat;
under circumstances which have given rise to
a good deal of discussion. At present the New Jersey
lew requires the consent of twb-thirds in interest of
tlit stockholders of a corporation before any radical
change can be made in its organization, any increase
ct its stock, or an3' alteration of its certificate of
incorporation. The amendment adopted by the Sen
ate provides that such changes may be made by two
thirds vote of the stockholders attending the meeting
2t which the vote is taken, even though they may
represent less than a majority of the capital stock.
Such an amendment would in itself be a subject
for comment even if no suspicious circumstances at
tended it, but in this case it is made worse by a re-,
port and a widespread belief that the change has been
dictated by the great steel trust of which the country
has heard so much ever since its organization.
At this distance from the State where the pro
pofe'd change is to be made it is not possible to pass
judgment upon the reported dictation of the stsel
t:nsL Even were there no such dictation the amend
ment would be bad. New Jersey's corporation laws
have long been so favorable to the organizers of such
bodies as to cause tht-m to resort to that State for
incorporation even when their business is to be car
ried on in other States. It is therefore plain that if
her-laws are to be amended in that respect they should
be changed in the direction of greater strictness rather
than of increased laxity, and very naturally the pro
pestd change has become the subject of distrust and
suspicion.
In this connection ;t is worth noting that in Great
T-ritain, where the evils resulting from corporation
methods of doing business have been as great a3
those in this country, there has been recently put into
operation a law designed to place such bodies under
much stricter regulations than . have heretofore ob
tained- From a summary of the law given in our
exchanges it appears that the most- important re
cuirement.of the new statute is absolute publicity of
all the actions of the directors. They are permitted
to do nothing in the dark, and any concealment of an
important act has the effect of nullifying the corpbra
ticn and putting the company under .the law that gov
erns copartnerships.
Another provision requires that , when articles of
incorporation specify that a director.njust'be a share
holder the requirement must be fulfilled literally.
Merely pro forma subscriptions, will not answer, and
a corporation which cccepts them vitiates its charter
ar.c! renders all of its members individually liable for
all debts incurred by The company without limitation.
It is further provided that no corporation. can begin
business or perform any corporate act until the num
ber of shares prescribed in its articles of incorpora
tion have been in good faith and fully subscribed for.
Failure to comply with that requirement renders the
promoters and organizers of the corporation liable
?o punishment for criminal offense.
It will be seen that while New Jersey is arranging
to give corporations Â« larger liberty' of action than
before the British have placed them under more strin
gent regulations. As the British" law did not go into
effect until three months ago it is too early to'deter
mine what will be its practical results. It appears,
however, to be a step in the right direction. Some of
the ablest men in the United States r/ave suggested
greater publicity as a remedy for the evils resulting
from corporations in this country, and it will there
fore be instructive to note the effects produced- by
that plan in Great Britain.
lie opinion and public ignorance may be
given a sentence - of Daniel Webster.
When John Adams died many of the
Legislature attended his funeral at
Quincy and they thriftily took occasion
to examine the Quincy Railroad, then
being constructed. Dr. P helps of the com
mission, an ardent enthusiast, was of
this party and pour*! into Webster's
ears all his hopes ana beliefs, to which
Webster answered: "Well, it certainly
is a subject for very grave consideration
whether roads for general travel cannot
be made . as you propose." This would
appear to be the most unsatisfactory and
least informed answer that could be
tfiven to any man ardent over a hobby;
but poor, dear- Dr.'.Phelns- Â¦was accus
tomed to so much worse things that" he
/wrote letters saying he received from
this answer "great i encouragement and
satisfaction."
Chancellor Livingstone's Views.
Many of the great minds of the day
Joined In the hesitation of Daniel Web
ster. When De Witt Clinton, in 1842, was
urging the building of " the Erie canal.
Colonel Stevens of Hoboken outlined and
urged a scheme for a railroad as a sub
stitute. His | brother-in-law, Chancellor
Livingstone, who .was an enthusiast on
the subject of steamboats, thus wrote to
him in regard to it:
â¢ I have read of your ingenious proposition,
but I fear the roads would be liable to serious
objections. They must be double to avoid the
danger of two such heavy bodies meetlnsr.
The -wall on which they arÂ» placed must be at
last four feet below the surface to avoid front
and three feet above to avoid snow, and must
bÂ« clasped with iron, and even then would
hardly sustain s-> heavy a weight as your pro
pope moving' at the rate of four miles an hour
on wheels. As to wood, it would not last a
week. They must be covered with iron and,
that, too. very thick and otron*. The means
of stopping those heavy carriages without
great shock and of preventing them from run
nine on and over each other would be very
difficult. In case of accidental stops or neces
sary steps : to talc* ; wood I and , water accidents
would happen. The carriage of condensing
water would be very troublesome. On -the
other hand, the expense would be much rreater
than the. canal, without- being so convenient.
The brilliant editor of the Boston Cour
ier,' Joseph Buckingham, declared a rail
road from Boston to Albany "lmpraetica
ble by the simplest rules of arithmetic";
that it would cost as much as the mar
ket value - of all the land in Massachu
setts, and "every person of common sense
knows would be as useless as a railroad
from Boston to the moon."
Dr. Phelps and his colleagues, however,
made a report to the Legislature urging
the building of a railroad from Boston to
Albany; but while the Legislature shilly
shallied, the State not daring to build and
stock dawdling, other States
were at work, and Massachusetts never
regained the hold and start she then lost.
The New York Central had a road and, a
locomotive in 1831, and South Carolina had
a railroad and Baltimore and Philadel
phia, had charters and wero at work on
their roads. .
propelled by wheels worked by a shaft in
the center. turned by four horses walking
around the shaft. The fare In these was
4 cents to Brooklyn or Jersey City. The
City of New York issued a fractional cur
rency note for 4 cents .which bore on. the
reverse side . a very . good cut of an old
"horseboat." 1 The ferry boats invented by
Fulton were practically like the â¢ ferry
boats now used. Fulton invented the en
tire ferry system as used to-dayâ ferry
houses with pivoted bridges and double
ended boats. . -' *
Biver ; and Canal Transportation.
On the great rivers primitive means of
transportation lingered long. The flat
boat* of the Alleehany and Ohio rivers,
the coal arks of * the TPelaware and-Sus
quehanna, the rafts of the Ohio, Missouri
and Mississippi, each were wonderful
links in internal commerce. The Upper
Mississippi I was fe. great- theater, of lum
ber rafting operations.
Though canals had been projected, in
Pennsylvania and Virginia with such
backers as Franklin and Washington, the
Middlesex canal, opened in Massachusetts
in 1803, was the first successful one. Other
snort canals were built in Maryland and
Pennsylvania, and soon the words. '.'Erie
canal" were In every one's mouth. , Tha
completion of this canal was a time of
great public rejoicing and celebration all
over the State of New York. Transporta
â¢tion at once was very heavy upon it, and
travel rapidly increased.' The old. saying.
"A cent and a half a mile, a mile and a
half an hour," was not literally true.
The best packet boats clipped through
the water at the rato.pf four miles an
hour; three horaes on the tow path to
each boat. Some people wÂ»re satisfletl,
but others were not, and they turned to
the glorious stage coach. ..
The Day of Stage Coaches.
There had been ."state waggons" and
"stage chaises," . "stage chairs," . and
"Â§tag:e chariots" and "coachees." and
soon there were "flylngr mall stages," an-1
"flyfng' â¢ machlnesr" but It wa3 not until
alter 1800 that there were the stage
coaches of story and romance, nor wxts It
until; after 1800 that thera was travel by
stage coach In any vast amount. When
steamboats from port to port shortened
jouri>eys every one wished to travel. A
journey : from. Nsw York to > Boston was
easy when you could go In a steamboat to
Newport or ?Providence arid then ride In
a well appointed coach to Boston. Turn
pikes-were built everywhere from town to
town and across country. The mosnin
cent National road,< DUllt first fronvCum
berland to Wheeling:, and -then extended,
had four splendid stage coach linesâ the
National,: Pioneer, Good Intent- and Juno
Bug. The Eastern Stage Company in,
New England, a "truat'.' formed in ISIS,
had an , extraordinary career > of prosper
ity. Taverns sprung up everywhere, great
stables were built, scores of coaches were
bought and hundreds of horses. The great
coaching days of England were given
from 1820 to 1840: they were earlier in
America, from 1810 to 1838, when the Eajt-
r ~T~^ HANKS to the caution of "Governor Wells the
1 . pro-polygamy rneasure of the Utah Legislature
is defeated. But tb^ere is a singular concurrence
in time between the veto and the remarkable decision
of the Utah Supreme Court, to which we have already
called attention. That. decision has attracted no at
tention outside the State, except the- analysis of it in
this paper. If our readers will refer to that analysis
and compare it with the bill which Governor Wells
killed they will see at once that the judicial decision
is a better safeguard to polygamy than that of: the
proposed statute. The decision is that proof of a
ntan's lawful marriage in one county/of the State is
insufficient â¢ to convict him of unlawful marriage in
another county. That stands as the law of Utah.
Under it a man may have a plural wife in every county
in the State and snap his fingers at prosecution.! Th.e
decision appeared between the time of the passage of
the Evans bill and its veto by the Governor, and to
have let the bill become a law would have been" a
surplusage. Â¦ â¢ . .. Â¦Â¦
The text of Governor Wells' veto message is' highly
interesting. It is a vindication of polygamy. a's of
divine origin, and puts the Governdr at one with his
people, for. he proudly declares himself the product
of i\ polygamous union. In that personal view of it all
thinking people sympathize with him. Only the
fanatical and unreasonable would expect him to de
clare himself a bastard, nor does any one with a
knowledge of law believe that he is. The local law
s:u! practice of Utah sanctioned the institution cf
which he is the fruit, and'its issue, up to the time the
law. forbade it, was legitimate, even if slightly mixed.
But Governor Wells not only avows his pride in his
mixed' lineage,- but. he .nowhere in his message con
cedes the right of the law to forbid a similar lineage
to others.. It is hardly an nndertone in the;veto that
maintains the; divine "sanction ofpolygamy/whilc the'
proposed law is condemned only because its enac:
ment will cause an amendment to the Federal* consti
tution, which he declares will bring prosecution and
persecution down upon Utah with a heavy hand.
Governor Wells is a very bright man. Few States
have as bright men for Governor. But did he not see
that the sole reason he gives for vetoing the bill is
-an admission that polygamy is. still rife in his. State?
If no one is in polygamy how could an amendment to
"the Federal constitution become the means of prose
cuting or persecuting anybody? If his people are
innocent of thrs breach it would have been wise and
brave in him to have said: "We welcome an anti
polygamy amendment to the constitution, and io
prove that we are in good faith will vote to ratify
it." Such a declaration would disarm all criticism.
We leave out of the discussion the moral objection
to polygamy felt outside the Mormon church. xMuch
that has been said against it may be for effect, and
therefore pretentious and hypocritical; but Utah
desired admission into the Union and procured it by
making a. solemn covenant that polygamy, or plural
marriage "should.be forever prohibited." That means
forever abandoned, prevented, abjured and done away
with.^ / , â¢ ,
Did Utah mean it? Did she act in good faith?
Those are the questions to be answered.' If she did
she' would be wise if she would herself propose the
anti-polygamy amendment to the constitution.' The
veto of the Evans bill-would better never 'have been
written than give the reason it does for b'eing written
at all. Instead of -being a pledge : of good faith, as
Governor Wells intended it should be taken, It is
proof positive of ba'd faith, and, taken in connection
with the Supreme Court. decision, establishes the ab
solute certainty that polygamy is in ' full 'swing again
in Utah, and that the only possible way. to suppress
it is to substitute for Utah's broken faith" the power
of - the Federal Government to enforce pledges and
punish those who break them. /We call the Mormons
to witness that for the recrudescence of this issue they
alone are responsible. â¢
Therest of the country gladly received ttieir great
pledge, appreciating^ the sacrifice it cost/ ThereVwas
a good spirit of forgiveness and f orgetfulness of the
past abroad- in the Union.
Â¦ If distrust have displaced trust, suspicion confidence,
ana contempt, for the pledge-breaker sympathy Tand
honor^for the pledge-maker," the Mormons, not the
Gentiles, are to blame. ,
THAT UTAH VETO.
The first quarter of the nineteenth cen
tury brought forth infinite Improvement
in works of travel and transportation.
The earliest excitement was in regard to
steamas a propelling. power. upo.n water.
In 1785 two men named. Fitch and Rum
sey had each ' apian- for a steamboat.
Fitch*, constructed a: boat' which made a
successf ur trip in 1788; but in spited his
Ingenuity and persistence he made small
progress on account of lack of funds. In
1804 Oliver "Adams had a. successful mud
scow, weighted: by the clumsy' name
Orunkter Amphibolis, which he skillfully
propelled I by [ steam on water and, when
fitted with wheels, on land. Colonel
Stevens of Hoboken also built a sturdy
steamboat -with side, wheels, v which went
from ! New York to Philadelphia by open
sea, but which was not permitted .to run
on the Hudson River on account' of a
monopoly given one Robert Fulton for
that tract of water.
R9bert "Fulton's : success was great.
Steamboats, ferry . boats, a ship-of-war,
soon were built under his direction.' At
that time I the ferry boats *. running from
New York to various points were what
were, known as "horsebbatB." They were
em Stage Company ceased to exist. Ruin
fell on many connected - with stage
coachesâ owners, drivers, stablemen,
blacksmithsâ for - the end of prosperity
came so suddenly that few heeded the
warning: words, "Look out for the en
gine." .
Doubtful as to Railroads.
â¢ After the successful opening assured
the prosperity of the Erie canal, a canal
was planned by the State of Massachu
setts to extend from Boston to the Hud
son River; the coat was estimated at
JC.000,000. Of course, a lottery was sug
gested to raise this sum. While the Leg
islature was hesitating a Btronger power
than a . canal â¢ had r been born ana was
growing. A ~ railroad party opposed the
canal party and an engineer named
Grldley Bryant, who had charge of the
making of Bunker Hill monument, built
to carry Â«*anite from Quincy to Boston
a horse " tramway four miles long. Thi3
granite railway was operated . for forty
years. The Inventor, Bryant, devised all
the appliances to .operate this railway
successfully, -such as the switch, port
able derrick, turntable, movable truck
for an eight-wheel car. These were pat
ented, buf Bryant died In poverty.
A commission of investigation as to
railroads was finally appointed In Mas
sachusetts, tout it met with intense con
servatism. As a typical example' of pub-

THE CAPTURE OF AGUINALDO.
BY,, the capture cf Aguinafdp General Funston
has added another to the many feats of daring
and heroism that make up the record of his
strenuous life. * Moreover, he has given to the annals
of the American army another story ot individual
prowess that" will be l^ng remembered as an incentive
?o similar exploits on the part of others. The taking
of the 'Filipino chief in his stronghold, surrounded
by his guards, constitutes, in fact, a chapter in the
romance of history hjardly inferior to anything ever
before accomplished.
It is to be borne in mind that this feat was. not
performed in a mere display of courage. It. was not
like the deeds of valor done by men in European
armies in the eager desire to attain a cross, or 'a star,
or other insignia of honor. There was nothing of
vainglory in the motive that prompted it, nor was it
in any way a useless risk of life.' On the contrary, it
was a feat of arms undertaken for an important mili
tary purpose. Its accomplishment is of the highest
strategic value in the conduct of the warâ far more
valuable, indeed, to American aims than would be
the taking of a Filipino fortress or the capture of a
dozen .towns. Aguinaldo "has been the strength of
the Filipino insurrection. He has been, according to
all reports, its head, its heart and its arm. His in
fluence only has held the insurgents together, inspired
them with hope and encouraged them to continue
their fruitless struggle against civilization. His cap
ture will result in such a demoralization of the .in
surgents as will render ineffectual any further at
tempts at continued resistance, and go far towatd
bringing about an immediate restoration of peace
under American rule throughout the islands.
The man who has accomplished this splendid stroke
of arms is a striking illustration of the saying of Dis
raeli, "Adventures are to the adventurous." It is a
common saying of our time that the agÂ« of romantic
adventure is over; that no one can now find the
opportunities for personal heroism that were so fre
quent in the days when civilization was less firmly
established and when security in life was largely de
pendent upon "the brave heart, the quick'eye and the
ready hand. Funston has shown by the indisputable
proof of things done that even in this age there is
ample room for the exercise of heroic qualities by any
man who has it in him to. exert them. He has been
an explorer in Alaska in the days before the rush of
multitudes for the gold fields made the Yukon Val
ley a well-trayeled road. He was a volunteer in
Cuba's war for liberty before the United States as a
nation took up her cause, and when at last the war
with Spain was undertaken he had already demon
strated his fitness for command.
â From- first to last he has teen the popular hero of
the war in the Philippines. The people, still remember
the story of the gallant dash by which he- led the
Twentieth Kansas Volunteers across the Rip Grande
in the face of an intrenched enemy, and how he was
wounded while leading the attack upon Santo Tomas.
His capture of Aguinaldo, therefore, does not come
as a . surprise to any one. In fact, when it was an
nounced beforehand that he-had planned the hazard
ous adventure and had set forth upon it with the ap
proval of General Mac Arthur there was a widespread
expectation that he would succeed.
While the capture of Aguinaldo breaks the strength
and the organization of' the existing opposition to
American rule in the Philippines, we must not assume
that there will, never â¢ be anpther insurrection.
Whether or no there is to be a lasting as well as an
immediate peace in the islands will depend much more
upon "the political than upon the military officials.
A wisely directed and honestly administered govern
ment may render it impossible for. any other Filipino
to imitate Aguinaldo's career. Bad government,
however, will cause future Aguinaldos to rise again
and again against us even as they rose from" genera
tion to generation ag?.inst Spain. It therefore be
hqoves our authorities to make the best use of the
opportunity to establish a pgrmanent peace. Fun
aton has captured Aguinaldo; it is for others to profit
by the victory.
equally discreet- in urging 'that in the Alabama con
vention the. negro j question beVdiscussed with closed
doors. "-: The disfranchisement of ; the negro is, in fact,
one ofthe movements of the time that "dare not meet
debate and discussion. .-Â¦' It must^move: forward with as
nmch secrecy as can be'mairitained/ and/ as affairs are
now managed in the South; a very remarkable degree
of sececy in politics is easily "maintained, by: the' Bour
bon bosses. Â¦* . -" Â¦ Â¦Â¦: <â¢'â¢*.*
The demand for secrecy in such a movement is to
some . extent a compliment to the public sentiment of
the country. It is a recognition of the fact that the
people would never sanction the wrong, and that any
cTiscussion , of it even by its friends and . advocates
v/ould arouse Â¦* opposition to 'it. There is nothing
complimentary, however, in the suggestion that so
great a wrong as is proposed can be perpetrated under
the eyes of the people without discussion. It would
be a blind nation indeed if so great a political move
ment could be carried oriÂ»in many States and extended
over a long' period of time without arousing the ob
jections of those. who believe that the privileges con
ferred upon all citizens by the constitution should be
secured by the Government for the blacks as well Sj
for the whites.
- The subject was not taken up at the time of the
passage of the apportionment bill at the late session
of Congress because the exigencies of politics led the
Republican leaders to deem it inexpedient -to": do so
at that time. Sooner or later, however, this issue will
be taken up and dealt with on its merits. Silence can
not be maintained all the time. -In fact, this very let
ter in which Morgan advises silence may prove to be
the jcause of an immediate discussion of the subject
throughout the Union. . . [

Exposition of Fine Arts.
The California Club is now engaged In

the Mechanics' â¢ Pavilion next month. It
will open April 10 and continue to the 20th.
The success attending the exposition held
two years ago encouraged the club to at
tempt another one. .
A meÂ«tlnjr will be held to-morrow morn-

ivu^the ordinance into execution will bo

and from -whom the half-fare tickets may
be purchased.
Tlit fight to secure for the school chil
dren of this city the privilege to ride to
and from school at half faro has finally
resulted In a complete victory for the
pupils. The presidents of the various
street railroads met yesterday morning- at
the office of the Market-street company
and after an exhaustive discussion of the
matter decided to allow the half-fare rate
to go Into effect without making any re
sistance. All the railroad magnates
who were present signified their approval
of the decision, excepting R. F. Morrow,
president of the Sutler-street line, who
refused to commit himself. He remained
neutral, neither dissenting nor approy
lnir.
The ordinance, which was passed by the
Supervisors In January, is to go into ef
fect on March 30. As yet nothing haÂ»
been done cither by the city officials or
the railroad companies to prepare for
carrying it into operation. Considering
this and to give time in which to provide
tlcVets, the railroads requested that the
institution of the half-fare rate be post
poned until April 15. ,
. This is the first concession of this . na
ture ever granted by the railroad com
panies in thin city. In other large cities
of the country the pupils have enjoyed for
yean the right to travel on the street cars
at half fare. In some localities the right
is Inserted In the franchise and the rall
ro8Ct company must acquiesce in it before
the charter Is granted. The fact that
this privilege is so universally acknowl
edged in the East exerted great influence
In inducing the railroad magnates to grant
It here.
In establishing the reduced rates the
companies decided that they still retained
their legal rights and that . hereafter
should the concession become burdensome
or 6hould more be demanded the consti
tutionality of the ordinance might be
tfc*ted. â¢ â¢ .

WITNESSES FROM
DELAWARE COMING
cepted as final and the Jury discharged.
ThÂ« plaintiff, a pretty miss of 17, told a
straightforward story on the witness
stand. The impromptu kissing, according
to her testimony, occurred on the evening
of July 2, between 6 and 7 o'clock. She
was employed in Kohs' bakery at 331
Fourth street. She testified that she had
gore into the kitchen to wash a cake knife
and that Kohs, whom she did not know
v.an there, suddenly seized her and em
braced and kissed her. The shock and
fright made her ill and she had to be sent
home in the care of two girls and subse
quently â¢ she went into convulsions and
was ill for nearly a month. ! The girl
denied indignantly on- cross-examination
that she had let any of the men employes

lanrl and Dleling were the Jurors who
stood out for a verdict for the plaintiff.
Harry Morris., a driver employed by
Kohs, told boastlngly on the stand that? he
had kissed the plaintiff once when she had
eaid.no young man could kiss her. That
was the only "osculatory* exercise*.' to
which the defense got testimony and the
plaintiff went on the stand to deny It.
ThÂ« lawyers, A. B. Treadwell and lay
man I. Mowry for the plaintiff and Otto
turn Suden for the defense, submitted the
cape without argument.' *
The jury was composed of the following
named:.

The defense tried to show that the plain
tiff frequently "eifgagad ' f in osculatory
esfercisea" with the bakers and . drivers
employed .by Kohs, but' their witnesses
failed them, Felder and Katie
Gloa. other pretty German girjs empolyed
by Kohs," had not seen any of the men
kiss her, though the first had seen a baker
named John try to kiss her. .
THE PRETTY PLAINTIFF AND

for Petty Larceny by Trick
and Device.
Men who prey upon, the unwary by
means of trick and device were taught a
lesson by Judge Cabaniss yesterday. J.
R. Fritz and A. McLane were each con
victed of petty larceny by trick and de
vice and were sentenced to three months
in the County Jail. The case against their
companion. F. L. Carey, was dismissed,
as there was not sufficient evidence to
convict. Â¦Â» Â¦ ' . -â¢'-".'Â¦
Joseph Rekar, a baker, living at 1823
Polk street. w, as the complaining witness,
lie testified that on Sunday evening.
March 17. he went into the place conduct
ed by the defendants at 425 Â£>upont street
and was induced to play the game of
throwing rings at knives and also at cir
cles marked blue and white. - When the
three defendants played they always won,
but when Rekar tried It he always lost.
He parted with $18, and said he would not
play any more. They c started to play
again and won as before,: and^Rekar, In
the hope of winning back his money, tried
again, but lost'$6 more.: â¢â¢Â».Â¦- *â¢
The Judge, in sentencing Fritz and Mc-
Lane. said it was difficult to get sufficient
evidence hÂ» bunko cases to convict, and
although there might be a strong sus
picion of guilt;, that was. not enough. In
this case, however* it was plain to him
that Rekar, had been tricked out of his
money in a most barefaced manner. The
defendants gave notice of appeal to the
Superior Court. -
The cases of Frank Marshall and four
others, charged with grand larceny by
trick and â¢ device Â¦ by playing the "plate
game" at the Cliff House, will be heard
by Judge Ca.baniss to-day. Their defense
will be that they have a license to play
the game.
Two of Them Get Three Months Each
MEN WHO SWINDLE OTHERS
ABE TAUGHT A LESSON
Judge Seawell has decided that under
tho law^aa it now stands the Assessor of
this city and county is not vested with au
thority to demand the production of books
and ; documents by those taxpayers who
are called to testify regarding statements
of taxable property furnished by them or
their knowledge of the correctness of
statements furnished by others. o ThiÂ» de
cision, which was reached in the case of
the people on the ' relation of Assessor
Dodge against A. B. Caldwell, warehouse
owner. Is of great importance, for, to a
large extent, it permits the placing of tax
able properties behind the doors of ware
houses and then closes them against ordi
nary processes.
Judge Seawell, in delivering his opinion,
remarked that, in view of the condition as
he found It.. the law should be amended
so as to give the Assessor greater scope
in bis Investigations Into the. correctness
of taxpayers' statements. .
Caldwell -was > sued- for. the statutory
penalty, as provided by section 3652 of the
Political Code," for his alleged . refusal to
testify and his admitted refusal to fur
nish books and documents bearing on
matters contained in his statement to the
Assessor. â¢ â¢
As a further ground of action it was
held that the defendant had taken the
same stand regarding his knowledge of
certain statements furnished 1 , the Asses
sor by Shun Yuen Hlng & Co., Sam Sing
& Co., Boldstone Bros., the "Bowers Rub
ber Company, H. Dutard, the Harry Unna
Company, A. Zellerbach & Sons, Wol
brook, Merrill & Stetson: California Safe
I>eposlt and Trust Company and Kwong
Wah & Co.
The case was ejaborately argued by
counsel and submitted on briefs.
Though Judge Scawell, in his decision,
holds .that the Assessor has the right to
examine a taxpayer regarding his own or
the statements of others, he maintains
that questions must be specific, and
that the right to go further and demand
books and documents is not conferred by
the law upon. the Assessor.
Judgment was therefore entered for the
defendant.
Hay Examine Taxpayer Regarding
â¢ His Own or Others' Written
Statements, but Here His
Authority Ends.

bearish ensemble of news might have excused
greater weakness: in a market .less confident
or the â¢ Fmalln<-R8 of : stocks. :â¢â¢ The weather to

Trade was light and May dropped to 42Sc.
litre the market steadied and began that
steady appreciation which culminated' In a
new hlRh record price for May delivery, doing
it in the face of strenuous efforts of certain
tw-ar houses to', hold it. - The bull leader was
orly a moderate : buyer, but outside buying
end the covering by scalpers raised May to
4Sc. The close was strongr, %o over yesterday,
at 42TÂ«c. . -â¢-.Â¦;'. ,-.-. . Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ . v Â¦ . .
- wheat was dull, narrowband uninteresting.
Much or the time business was at A standstill,
v/hlle traders turned a .wUtful eye on. the su
perior animation of corn. It was the strengrth
of this market which saved wheat Â¦ from suc
cumbing to ihe prevalent bearlshnes*. . Even
rtports.of fly damages were received with
8pathy. Heavy receipts and the weakness of
the export- situation., -the mild, clear -weather
and the optlmlFmtof the Price Current report
combined . to create bearish t>entlment. May

prosecution of 5 Gonzalo* do iQuesada and
Horatio S. Rubetis in Havana. Secretary
of War Root said to-day that he had not
received .any information from General
Wood, about the matter. He remembered,
however., that General Wood had commu
nicated to the department the information
that Rubens was no longer connected
with the prosecution of the postofflce
fraud cases, but he did not know the rea
son of .. this, . ar. all proceedings in that
case were now In charge of the fiscal or
prosecuting officers at Havana. .; It is
known that there has been much
friction between General ' Wood and Ru
bens. Â¦ Rubens has been frequently -al
luded to as the- "eyes and ears of Secre
tary'Root in Cuba." .
Â«He was formerly chief clerk In the law
offices of Secretary Root's firm. He came
into prominence in connection with the
Cuban Insurrection by being employed us
counsel for the Cuban Junta in the United

Is the separation of the sexes after the

Ship Clerks Organized.
Efforts are being made to organize
building trades councils In different parts
of the State. One has already been formed
in Stockton, and It is proposed to enlarge
the field or operations. From these or
ganizations It is proposed to form a cen
tral council, with headquarters in San
Francisco, that will be able to regulate
affairs as the central and executive body.
Building Trades Council.
! Everything Is quiet at the Union Iron
Works, although the striking members of
the ship fitters' union claim they are re
ceiving daily accessions to their ranks..
Apart from the natural- delay caused by
the breaking in of new men, the managers
of the various departments claim that no
mconvenlence is experienced. Hundreds
of applications are daily filed for posi
tions, and the men who can prove their
capacity, coupled with previous experi
ence, are readily - engaged. The strikers,
to the number of sixty or more, meet daily
In the Potrero Opera-house, and after
hearing reports and passing resolutions
adjourn. So far none of the other branches
of trade have been affected by the strike.
Some talk is also being Indulged In re
garding a strike among the workers In the
eteam laundries, but so far there seems to
be no tangible basis for It. None of, the
laundry workers, care to admit that the
matter is even being discussed. The laun
dry proprietors are also reticent upon the
subject and do not care to discuss the sub
ject. :
Officers Bakulich andO'Rourke and Spe
cial Policemen Oeorge Downey and George
Duffleld rushed up to the alley in time to
see the combatants: running down the
street, and could discover no wounded
men. Yesterday It was learned that both
Ah Bow and Jung Kong had been shot In
the shoulders and badly : injured.' They
were found in squalid quarters and re
moved to a place where their wounds
could be properly dressed. : - ,.
.The shooting was caused by a difficulty
In which a woman was, concerned. ,The
lady had four f admirers, and her atten
tions to one of them - aroused f he jealousy,
of the other three. As the quartet passed
from the house a rock was thrown from
one of the windows,*" and one of the
wooers' friends was accused 'of having
cast it. A' challenge' to' fight was given,
and the parties, after having, secured
weapons, returned to the place and bullets
commenced to fly. â¢--'
â¢The police have just made the discovery
that : Ah | Bow and ' Jung j Kongr; two Chi
nese, were ; shot . and possibly fatally
Â¦wounded in a battle which occurred in
Sullivan alley early Monday morning.
Notwithstanding the fact that patrolmen
and special officers were on the scene im
mediately after the shots, were fired, the
wounded Mongolians, were .spirited away
by their countrymen and kept in hiding
until they were" located yesterday and
sent to the office of Dr. Buckley, at 514

llach received the unanimous support of
the Republican membership present, one
member beinj? aliment.
The end of the deadlock In reality came
unexpectedly two hours before the last
joint ballot of the session was to be tak
en. Seventy Republicans, In person or by
j'roxy, assembled in the caucus room of
the Lindell Hotel to make what was be
lieved l>y nearly all to be a final vain ef
fort to find a solution of the three
monfhp" bitter struggle. Seven ballots
had bf en taken without result on the long
term, when D. K. Thompson, the short
term caucus nominee, formally announced
his withdrawal from the race and sug
gested the name of Governor Dietrich as
liis eucceÂ«tor. Meanwhile the North
J'latte light continued and Lorenzo
<'rounse jumped to a prominent place,
threatening a nomination at one time by
Ffuring ihlrty-nve votes.
The next sensation was the announce
ment of Edward Rosewatfr's withdrawal
in favor of George W. Uninger of Omaha.
Meanwhile J. H. Millard had appeared as
a new North Plane candidate and he im
mediately bocame a hot opponent of
< rounpe for the place. The ten boltinp
Republicans had entered the caucus be
fore Thompson'h withdrawal, and it was
then a complete caucus of party mem
l*r*. Mfs*rs. Meiklejohn. H. E. Martin
und W. E. Hir.fhaw withdrew.
Four ballots were taken. On the first
Governor Dietrich was nominated almost
by acclamation. Harlan receiving a few
votes. Two more disclosed a close nsnj
between Millard and Crounee. the second
balJct f-howlng thirty-two to thirty-four
In the former"? favor. Then the third was
taken and Millard had eaincd a consid
erable further lead. It was then biovpiI
to name him by acclamation, ana this
was done on the fourth ballot.
Both Thompson and Rosewater made
4-ddresses to the caucus in withdrawing:
Their names. Mr. Thompson said he be
came satisfied last night that he could not
hope to win. and for the good of the party
he would step aside. He would thank his
followers for their loyal support and
Â«-loeed by nominating- Governor Dietrich
us his choice for the short term.
Mr. Rosewater said: "I pledged ray
word to President McKinley last Decem
ber that I would not stand in the way of
Nebraska electing two United States Sen
atrrF. Th*Â» time has come for me to re
deem that pledge. Under the peculiar
conditions which now confront us I deem
it essential that my personal ambitions
l>e subordinated to patriotism and duty to
party. I desire to withdraw my name,"
The caucus adjourned at 10:30 o'clock,
;<r.d an hour and a half later its action
v.is ratified at the joint convention of the
legislature. News of the caucus had be
come generally known and there was a
irernendouB crowd in the hall of the
House when the ballot was taken. The
proceedings, however, were devoid of ex
citement. Following the selection two
nominee committees were appointed to
apprise them of the action of the Legis

WASHINGTON. . March 2S.-:Several
parties from the p-eoloKical survey, com
prising in all about 100 men. will begin

Nevada bfirder line and the reclamation
of the fertile lands on the Nevada side.

opinions concurred in holding the indict

FRANKFORT. Ky.. March 28.-The
HEW TBTAT, GRANTED
TO POWERS AND HOWARD
TRENTON. N. J.. March 25.â The Court
of BrrÂ©W and Appeals this afternoon,' by
a vote of 9 to 5. decided to reverse the
Chancellor's decision In the American
Smelting and Refining Company case.
To-day's decision orders the issuance' of
an injunction restraining the American
Bmeltlr.g and Refining Company from
taking any further action in the matter
of increasing its capital stock or acquir
tnp by purchase the property of M. Gug
genheim's Sons unless it shall be made to
appear on final heariflk that the stock
to be issued for the purchase of the Gug
genheim plant does not exceed the value
of the property to be acquired by the
purchase.
The decision Is looked upon here as one
of great rignificance with respect to the
incorporation of companies under New
Jersey laws in the future. The practice of
acquiring properties and paylm? for them
in stock has been very general and here
tofore tt has not b*>en the policy of the
State to Inquire into the value of the
property purchased or the . amount of
etock Issued on account of the purchase.
It is feared that the decision may have
the effect of causing: corporations to po
elsewhere to become incorporated, al
though this view is not entertained by all
corporation lawyers.
Practice of Acquiring Property in
This Manner Is Stopped by-
Legal Decision.

Written Decision Deals Elaborately
1 : With "itiwA Eights "â¢: of -Courts to
Punish Violations of Re-
Â¦training Orders.'
ST. LOUIS, March 28.â In the United
States Court of Appeals to-day a decision" 1
was handed down sustaining' the position,
of the lUnited States Circuit : Court in" the
case of John P. Reese,-, a member, of the
executive -, committee of I the* United Mine
Workers of America; who was Imprisoned
for- alleged j contempt j of an Injunction "or
der and subsequently released on a writ- of
habeas corpus. ; The decision,, which 'Was
written ;by;~ Judge Adams, deals , elabor-;
ately with the rights of courts to^ punish'
for the violation of restraining orders".
-Reese - and others went to Kansas in
1899 in- the progress* of 'a coal strike and
delivered speeches In behalf of. the gtrlk-:
ers. - In July, 1899, the Coal i and
Mining Company, . Qne of t the ; largest con
cerns ; affected . by the strike, secured an
injunction against all members of v the
mine workers'. union and "all others' com-,
bining, confederating or conspiring with
them, who are residents of the State."- Â¦
Â¦After delivering a speech Reese Â¦was ar
rested on the ground that he had violated
the injunction and was sentenced to a
term of six . months in the jail at Fort
Scott, Kansas. Â¦â¢ The case. was appealed, to
Judge Thayer, who ordered the discharge
of Reeee. It was, to pass on the merits
of Judge Thayer's : ruling that the case
waa referred : to : a higher court. Judge
Adams ", holds that - the restraining -ordÂ£r
does not necessarily, have , to apply spe
cifically, to any person to inflict punish
ment for, its violation;; He says that the
mere fact that the order of a court is de
fied by those who have knowledge of it ia
of itself sufficient justification for con
tempt proceedings.- Â¦. . -
In the case at issue different circum
stances are presented, he held. â¢ The i de
fendant was punished for violating an or-'
der in behalf of private interests and not
because he had. held Jn contempt the dig
nity of the* court . It was not demon
strated, the court says, that
Reese in any manner had conspired or
combined Â¦ to - injure the' property of the
complaintants/, : . . .
After reviewing the points involved
Judge AOams said:
From ; trie foregoing 1 U-!s apparent that the
oftense of violating Â«n express* restrainins
order Issued at the suit of a private . litigant
for his .protection is one thing:, dependent upon
the actual existence of such rest raining order
against the person charged with the oftense in
the suit to which he is a party, by name or
adequate representation, and that the ofCenao
of a person not a party to' a suit in aiding; or
abetting such party to disobey or resist a ; rfc
stralninr order against himself or lndepen
der.tly Â¦ or" intentionally thwarting â¢ the - admin
istration of - justice Is another j and essentially
different thins:.;-* Â¦ â¢ . â¢- . Â¦
The petitioner had the- right, accorded him
Â¦by the constitution of, the 'land and time-hon
ored I precedents to stand upon the accusation
as made - ana ' to defend himself against the
charge as made, namely, that he had violated
the injunctive order.
. He Â¦ exercised the right, and, after , being
found . ffutlty and imprisoned for violating the
injunctlve order, '. proceeded to challenge the
lawfulness of, his restraint for the reason that
he was â¢ not a party to the cause in which the
injunction wan issued and, that the court waa
without Jurisdiction to call him to account for
violating It. * , ' â¢ â¢ Â¦ " .

SUSTAIN S REESE
Clairmonte fell heir .recently to con
siderable property, which, however, is so
deeply involved as to be of little value to
his young son.
.There being: no one to arrange for the
dead man's funeral and not money suf
ficient to pay for even the poorest kind of
a burial. Cawston has taken charge of tha
body and has guaranteed the payment of
the funeral expenses, that the man may
receive a burial befitting his station. The
funeral services will be held to-morrow
afternoon.
Egerton Clairmonte waa well connected
In | Nova Scotia, where he was born. He
was the eldest son of Adolphus Julian
Clairmonte of Lakelands. N.S. He wti
a man of culture and education and was
the author of "The Africander." He mar
ried the widow of H. H. W. Melville, who
later, as his wife, became famed as a:i
author under the nom de plume of
"George Egerton." Sho gave to the world
of " literature i "Fantasias." "Discords,"
"Keynotes," - "Symphinies," "The Wheel
cÂ«f God," "Young Ofee'Â«* Tables/% and
Other .compositions.
Soon after arriving Â¦ here he was taken
ill with pneumonia and' was removed to
the Christian Hospital. Here the disease
was running its usual course, with appar
ently every chance of recovery up till
11 o'clock Sunday morning. At- 11:10 the
man was dead. He.-vas seized with a
spasm of the heart, and before medical
aid could reach him he had expired.
-, Clairmonte was almost a stranger In
Loa Angeles. He carotÂ« here first about
six weeks ago and farmed the acquaint
ance of Edwin Cawstck of the * South
Pasadena ostrich 'farni.- ' Through' Caw
ston, Clairmonte entered into a contract
with the Pearson ostrich farm at Phoenix
to act as manager. . He did not i seem to
be satisflecjr, however, and came ' to Los
Angele3 ' to see If he could find anything
to suit him better.

Statistician Griffin, was * at one . time an
officer In the, National Guard. He was left
a large : sum ', of \ money by his father, a
well-known^cltlzen.'but-lt^ did J not ' take
him long to spend it. as he was bf a most
liberal- and; oben-hearted disposition, no
friend \ suffering '-while ; he i had - money. Â¦ : â¢
Griffin resided for, some time in the State
of Sonora,-' Mexico, ; and? speaks Spanish
fluently. -Ha ;;was 'married only. a^. few
months ago to an estimable lady. -
". Always * In the? first rank as an expert
accountant; when he cared to follow such
work, Griffin .proved a genius as a statis
tician. 4 He was continually enlarging and
Improving, his system, and. .had his mind
not become clouded, would perhaps have
achieved fame In that line.
The Insanity Commission had a sad
duty to perform yesterday in reebmmend
ing to the Superior Court the commit
ment of Will D. Griffin. late statistician
of the Board of Health. to aState hospital
for the insane. Griffin ' was yesterday
committed to the asylum at Agnews.
: In, the snuffing. out. of Griffin there was
extinguished a bright mental candle that
blazed for a time with great credit to the
body that appointed him. " The majority
of people who knew ; Griffin looked upon
hlm, ; simply as. a .very erratic bohemian.
who could play, the. piano beautifully and
talk flowingly.. but not deeply upon many
subjects. ; Neither they nor the general

had won for. him, or rather for the board

Mrs. Henarie died a few -weeks ago and
petition to admit her will to probate Is on
record. Whether or not her heirs will ap
peal from : Judge Coffey's judgment re
mains to be seen. There is about $200,000
involved in the controversy and it is not
probable that the: heirs, will accept the
ludgment of the Superior Court as final.
It will hence, be years before the final dis
tribution of the estates of the decedents
will be ordered. Â¦â¢Â¦â¢ Â¦'Â¦ '
The Instrument was. what It purported to be
on its face, a full settlement, for valuable con
siderations, of all matters in controversy In the
divorce case, which Included necessarily a com
plete adjustment of any rights she might hav*
preserved by â¢ her deed of separation, in the
community property: it was not a mere receipt,
but was a contract for a substantial, and valid
consideration, therein expressed In pecuniary
terms relinquishing all rights, past, present
and prospective, in or to the subject matter of
the litigation: it was a final compromise of all
their differences arid a termination of their
disputes: it was so acted upon by the releasee
and it would eeem Inequitable to allow Its va.
lldlty to be new gainsaid by the releasor: the
'transaction was fair; in addition to the thou
sands of dollars passed to her" by Its terms,
there were other valuable considerations. In
cluding an implied waiver of, any right he
might have to recover the ninety-odd thou
sand dollars* worth of property Â¦ transferred to
her under the contract, which she had broken
by her institution of an action for divorce,
which breach was .repaired by this release, an
instrument constituting the conclusion of the
conjugal controversy for all time. . Â¦
Heirs -at law of the late Mrs. Mary A.
Henarlo will not be enriched by her ac
tion against the estate of her late hus
band, D. V. B. Henarle. In an opinion
handed . down â¢ yesterday Judge Coffey
denies her petition for distribution to her
o* one-half of the estate of T>. V. B.
Henarie on the ground that the same was
community property. In passing on Mrs.
Henarie's claim, Judge Coffey reviews her
career and that of her husband from the
time of their marriage in December, 1854,
up to the date of the institution of the ac
tion just, decided. . â¢
The court finds that during their mar
ried life up to 1886 Henarie was assisted In
every way by his wife, who, In fact, gave
him sufficient money, which through great
economy she had saved, to buy the inter
est in the flrra of Martin & Co. that sub-,
sequently made him rich. In 1SS6 Mr. and
Mrs. Henarie separated, an agreement
being signed by both providing- for Mrs.
Henarie's financial welfare, and In return
she agreed not to sue him for maintenance
or divorce. Mrs. Henarie finally broke
this agreement, however, and Instituted
proceedings for divorce and half of the
community property. This case was
dropped. i however. before judgment had
been rendered. Upon the dismissal of this
action in January, 1SS7. another, agree
ment was entered into* between Mr. and
Mrs. Henarie, in which) for a considera
tion of $90,000. she agreed to surrender all
claim to any portion of his estate.
After . Henarle'8 death, however. - Mrs.
Henarie filed a petition for distribution to
her of one-half of her husband's estate.
In opposition to hen petition the agree
ment entered into in ISST.was produced.
This agreement. Judge Coffey holds. Is
valid and binding and hence the petition
for distribution is denied. Upon this
point Judge Coffey says:

â¢ The treaty of "the cession of Louisiana
and the treaty with Mexico and the Alas
ka treaty are' quoted as illustrations of
the takincr' in as citizens of the. United
States of the natives and citizens of ceded
and conquered territory. There Is one ex
ception, and that is the bill to provide a
government for Porto Rico. The bill as
originally introduced in Congress declared
that: all the Inhabitants of Porto Rico,
with a certain qualification and exception,
"shall bo deemed and held to be citizens
of the United States." This provision was
stricken out before the b'.ll became law.
Mr. Griggs' opinion goes on to say the
constitution of the republic of Ha
waii provided that "all persons ! born
or â¢ naturalized in tho Hawaiian
Islands, and subject to the juris
diction of the republic are citizens there â¢
of." The act of April 30. 1900. providins a
government for the Territory. of Hawaii
declared that "alls oersons who were citi
zens of the republic of Hawaii on August
12. 1S3S, are hereby deciarcJ to be citizens
of the United. States and citizens of tho
Territory of Hawaii."
In response to said reference an administra
tive ruling: was returned on January 15 of, the
current year to the effect that Hawaiian borh
persons of the Chinese race having 'been made
citizens of tha republic of Hawaii, under, the
section of the act of April 30. 1900. above re
ferred are made citizens of the Territory
of Hawaii and of the United States. .Said
opinion is hereto appended for your . informa
tion. Respectfully, F. H. LABNED,
Acting: Commissioner .General.
Historical Precedents.
The questions determined by the opinion
of Attorney General Grig&s referred to
are as follows: *
Iâ Whether a person born, in the Ha
waiian Islands .in 1S83 of Chinese parents
who are laborer?, and taken to China with
his mother in 1890.." is-, entitled to re-enter
the Territory of Hawaii, where his father
still reahJes? . '
2â Whether the wife and children ot a
Chinese person, who was naturalized in
1887 in Hawaii and still resides there, are
entitled to enter that Territory "by virtue
of the citizenship" of tho husband and
father?
This Issue has heretofore been raised by the
Collector of Customs at the port of Honolulu.
H. T., and. In the absence of any judicial
ruling: thereon, was referred to the honorabla
the Attorney General of the United States. " i
The following reply arrived by. mail yes
terday morningr, dated Washington,
March 23: * .
The bureau acknowledges the receipt of your
letter of 15th Inst. propounding a qu-stlon of
law In connection with your action In
refusing permlnslon to â¢ land . at your
port to two Chinese sailors who asserted that
they wÂ«re native born Hawaiian citizens. In
the particular case referred to you state that
their application was refused upon the ground
that they did not present sufficient proof of
the facts alleged by them In support of their
claim, but that had such facts been clearly
shown, while not clear upon the point, you
are rather inclint-d tr the belief that such per
sons, whether laborers or not, cannot be ad
mitted Into the United States under the pro
visions of section 4 of the act of Conrress. ;
approved April 30, 1900, which prescribes a
form of sovernment* for the Territory of Ha
waii.
Commissioner's Opinion.
The oplnfon was called forth by Col
lector Stratton's action in the matter of
the application of two Chinese sailors oft
the ship John Currier for admission to the
United States, on the ground that thty
were natives of the Hawaiian Islands.
They failed to establish their claim to the
satisfaction of the Collector, and they
were denied a landing. In his report to
the Secretary, of the Treasury, Collector
Stratton stated that r even if the appli
cants had proved that- they .were natives
of Hawaii he would r.ot have allowed
them to land, they being of the Chinese
race. He asked whether in such a con
tingency' the department would sustain
his action. ,
Port Collector Btratton received an of
ficial communication yesterday from the
Immigration Bureau -at Washington to
the effect that all the native and natural
ized citizens of the Hawaiian Islands. Ir
respective of race, color or previous con
dition of servitude, are citizens of the
United States, and that the wives and
children of such, aJthouch aliens, become
citizens and acquire the political status of
the father, and the right to visit and re
side In the United States, exclusion, acts
and Immigration laws to the contrary
notwithstanding.
