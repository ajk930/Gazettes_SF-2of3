CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
"XV.. "WASHINGTON, Nov. 12.â Here are
Borne of the important points in the final
report of the Isthmian Canal Commission,
vhich was practically completed to-day:
Firstâ Consideration of all information
obtained Â¦with regard to the Nicaragua
end the Panama canal routes establishes
that the former is "the most practicable
and feasible route for an isthmian canal
to be under the control, management and
ownership of the United States."
Secondâ Provision is made for a canal
â¢which shall have a depth of thirty-five
feet and a width at the bottom of at
least 150 feet, and which shall be provided
Â¦with eiirht locks, four on either side of
Lake Nicaragua.
Thirdâ Estimated cost of the construc
tion of the canal by the Nicaragua route
is Â£bout $200,000,000. This Is 558,000,000 moiv
than it will cost to complete the Panama
car.al, excluding the price that would
have to be paid for acquiring the Panama
canal concession.
Nearer to United States.
While the Panama canal, after comple
tion, would be shorter than the Nicara
gruan canal and would have fewer locks
and less curvature, enabling the saving
of twenty-one hours for the passage of a
ship from the Atlantic to the Pacific
QfpaÂ», this advantage is offset by tha
fact that the Nicaragua route is nearer
to the United States and a ship sailing
between New York and San Francisco
could save time by using the Nicaragua
instead of the Panama route.
Fourthâ The commission declines to rec
ommend for adoption the proposal sub
mitted by the Panama Canal Company
relative to the price which shall be paid
by the United States for its concession.
Trammeled by this concession. Colombia
is rot free to enter into independent ar
rangements with the United States.
Fifthâ Unlike Colombia, Nicaragua and
Costa Rica are absolutely unbound by
any engagements and are prepared to
make liberal concessions to the United
States to Induce It to build the Nicaragua
canal.
Combination in Opposition.
The recommendations of the commis
sion are unanimous. While the commis
sion will make no reference in its report
to obstacles which may be thrown in the
tray of legislation In behalf of the Nica
ragua route, its members understand that
a combination has been formed to defeat
the Nicaragua canal bill which will be the
outcome of its report.
This combination consists of the follow
ing interests: The transcontinental rail
read companies, Pacific Mail Steamship
Company. Panama Canal Company, Suez
Caral Company and Atlas Steamship
Company.

"LES HUGUENOTS" IS WELL RENDERED
BY GRAU'S TALENTED OPERA SINGERS
SOCIETY was not fully represented
last evening at the Grand Opera
house when Maurice Grau pre
sented "Les Huguenots" for the
second performance of the grand
opera season. The appearance of the
auditorium was in striking contrast to
the openirg night, when the flower of
fashion, culture and wealth thronged the
big building and showered its approval
on the famous artists who sang in "Lo
hengrin."
The indisposition of Calve, who was to
have made her iirst appearance here in
"Carmen," was the cause of the second
night of the opera season being an "off
night" in the matter of attendance.
The sympathy of every one must be ex
tended to Manager Grau and his ener
getic associates, whose superb plans have
been temporarily upset by the delicate
throat of the "greatest Carmen of all."
There was no long line of carriages last
night and vacant boxes and rows of seats
told a mute story of the disappointment
that society felt in the change of pro
gramme and the substitution of "Les
Huguenots' for "Carmen" with only two
days' notice.
There was no crush in the foyer before
the performance or during the intermis
sions, and gorgeous gowns were conspicu
ous by their absence.
Ovation for Gadski and De Reszke.
Had Calve appeared, as originally an
nounced, last night she would have been
received by an overflowing house, for
every seat had been sold on Saturday
last. The news of the diva's indisposition,
made public on Sunday, caused ticket
holders to change seats for next week,
when Calve Is expected to sing.

German Shipping Endangered.
LONDON, Nov. 13.â "An American syn
dicate has purchased 10,000 shares of the
stock of a Hamburg steamship lino
through a Vienna bank," says a Berlin
correspondent of the Daily Mall. "The
purchaser is thus enabled to demand at

frigid one, and the lack of applause in
the first and second acts seemed to af
fect the singers. But a treat was in store
for all present, for in the third act
Madame Gadski, incomparable artiste
that she is, with Edouard de Reszke,
fairly roused the audience from its leth
argy and by sheer artistic work won
round upon round of cheers and many
curtain calls.
Much interest was displayed in the first
appearance of De Marchi, the tenor, who
sang Raoul, and the favorites of last sea
son all received hearty recognition when
the audience "warmed up" to the efforts
of the singers. Scottl, Journet, Suzanne
Adams, Madame Van Cauteren, Miss
Bauermeister, Jacques Bars and Miss
Louise Homer were awarded applause
and curtain calls after the third act.
Seppilli Conducts Masterfully.
Seppilli conducted the orchestra and
again proved himself a master of his
craft.
At the conclusion of the performance
many of those present adjourned to the
grillroom of the Palace Hotel and other
fashionable places to enjoy midnight sup
pers.
To-nisrht "La Traviata" will be sung,
with Madame Sembrich, Madame Van
Cauteren, Miss Bauermeister, Campanari,
Vanni, Bars, Dufriche, Gilibert and
Salignac in the cast.
To-morrow evening "Tannhauser" will
be given, with Madame Eames, Van
Dyck. Viviani, Bispham, Bars and Louise
Reuss-Belce in the principal characters.
"Die Walkure" will be given on Friday
night, and "Faust" on Saturday after
noon. "Manon," with Sibyl Sanderson, is
the bill for Saturday night, and "La
Boheme" Is to be sung on Sunday night
at popular prices.

can danger to German shipping is more
serious than has been supposed."
Paying Theatrical Venture.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 12.â
Treasurer Edwards of the Associated
Students was remarkably successful
financially in his theatrical venture. The
receipts from the performance of "The
Man From Mexico," given at the Grand
Opera-houtse under student body man
agement show that the treasury is more
than $400 richer through the transac
tion.
FOUR PRINCIPALS OF THE METROPOLITAN OPERA-HOUSE COMPANY
OF NEW YORK WHO SANG IN "LES HUGUENOTS" AT THE SECOND
GRAU PERFORMANCE OF THE SEASON IN THIS CITY.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
THE ponderous splendors of
"Gli Ugonotti," even with the in
most part excellent cast afforded
it by Mr. Grau last night, did not
serve to nil the Grand Opera
house as Eames and "Lohengrin" filled it
on Monday evening. The disappointment
of the Calve Carmen naturally counted
here, but there were not a few empty
seats around the edges of the house, and
there was a general air of "lights fled and
garlands dead" about things. The enthu
siasts were resting after their tremen
dous efforts of the night before, and
though there was spasmodic magnificerce
about the performance, it must be con
ceded that as a whole it was not one to
create a wild enthusiasm. The chorus fell
distinctly short, both in quality and vol
ume of tone, even the favorite "Rataplan"
song hardly getting a hand. It lacked
spirit, swing, for the most part, though
there were a few moving climaxes that
lifted things choral to where they should
be. Neither was the orchestra quite the
same instrument in Mr. Flon's hands as
that from which Mr. Damrosch drew such
satisfying harmonies on Monday night,
lacking a little the swift certainty of re
sponse, the magic obedience to the Dam
rosch baton. Neither is "The Huguenots"
Wagner, for the matter of that. Still there
is much that is genuinely beautiful in ihe
opera, gloomy grandeurs and pageantries
of sound, the love music of Valentine and
Raoul, the passing splendor of "The Con
secration of the Swords" and other num
bers that will linger when even the bril
liant cast that now makes "The Hu
guenots" a possibility on a distinguished
programme shall no longer have that
power.
Scribe waa not at his clearest when he
furnished the plot for "Gli Ugonotti." As
often as one hears the opera just so often
Is it necessary to get the libretto to un
tangle the plot, to know who is doing
what and why. The explanatory demon is
at his busiest during its progress, noth
ing save a Bernhardt drama offering him
so rich opportunity. It was not difficult
to disentangle Scotti from the crowd of
nobles that appear in the opening scene,
nor De Reszke, but tho new tenor could
not be so easily distinguishedâ by ear.
De Marchi does not quite fulfill expecta
tions, as he was heard last night. So
much was expected, however, that It la
perhaps not surprising that ha fell some
what short. His voice lacks smoothness,
roundness, though one big- full high note
that the house rose to, by the wayâ gave
indication that Signor de March! was
perhaps not in best form. He lacks
strength dramatically, but is a pleasing
fimjre in the picture.
The plaudits last evening were mostly
for Gadski, the well-beloved of San Fran
cisco, who sang the part of VaJentine.
It is a dear and beautiful note that Gad
ski touches. She has an eminently ten
der, human, woody-sweet voice, and her
gentle graciousness lifts every part she
sings to an exquisite distinction. She has
power, too, and restraint, and gave last
night a Valentine that, while it lacked
the brilliance of Nordica's, had yet a
quality more lovable in its tenderness.
Mme. Gadski was not long suffered to
remain in ignorance of what the audience
thought of her, being greeted immediately
on her appearance with applause of the
heartiest. She seems to be in excellent
health, and will be heard again on Fri
day evening in "Die "Walkure."
Scottl was magnificent as the <~omte de
Nevers. Te gods, but how the fellow can
sing! He Is. aflame with inspiration and
voiced like an Israfel who has turned his
attention to opera instead of oratorio.
The Comte de Nevers is a small part,
true, but for sheer vocal and dramatic
weight It overpowered everything in
sight save De Reszke's Marcel, that was
not always safe from comparison, either.
De Reszke's Marcel Js one of his number
less magnificences, and he used that big
abounding basso of hi 9in soul-satisfying
fashion last night. It remains only to
speak of Suzanne Adams, who slipped
into our hearts last year Just as she was
leaving, in "Rigoletto," and Mr. Journet,
who was not quite Plancon as Saint Brl*
4 Miss Adams has matured in her art
since her last visit here. Her voice has
rounded, sweetened and gained poise,
and her Marguerite di Valois evidences
altogether a remarkable progress on the
young artist's part since last year. She
is still self-conscious, a little stiff in
movement, but there's every hope for the
bright young American. Louise Homer's
bright voice and smile were excellently
uaed- in the part of Urbain.

cisco season was cut off in so untimely
fashion last year, returns to delight in

damage has been done by floods. Several
fatal accidents have occurred, and rail
way communication is delayed. In some
parts of the country the rain has con

PRESIDENT
IS AGAINST
THE PLAN
Coming Message Will
Urge New Treaties
of Reciprocity.
This Attitude Is Causing Eigh
Tariff Men Much Un
easiness.
Prominent Business Representative*
Seeking Closer Trade Relations
With the Dominion of
Canada.
Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 12.â President
Roosevelt in his message will discourage
the idea of a revision of the tariff. He
will not come out flat-footÂ«d against it,
but the inference will be very broad. He
will touch on this subject In connection
with his recommendations in favor of re
ciprocity.
The President, notwithstanding reports
to the contrary, will be very strong and
urgent in favor of laws being passed that
will make reciprocal relations with other
countries possible.
Pressure in favor of reciprocity con
tinues unabated and is causing high tariff
men much uneasiness. Edwin G. Preston
of the Boston Chamber of Commerce and
M. S. Greenough of the Cleveland Cham
ber of Commerce, called at the White
House this morning to perfect plans for a
conference there to-morrow morning at
which representatives of commercial
bodies in nearly all the Northern cities
will be present to urge negotiations for a
reciprocity treaty with Canada.
Pressure for Reciprocity.
Members of this convention arriving
during the day met at 9 o'clock this even
ing to discuss definite plans, such as the
selection of a spokesman, and. what Is
.more ,. important . > a-., specific - rer-xiname-nrta -
tion which they will make to the Presi
dent. He may be asked to urge Canx
dian reciprocity in his message, or, what
would be more effective, to take steps
toward a renewal of the sessions of
the High Joint Commission, which is still
in existence. Of course this project ha*
nothing to do with the Kasson treaties,
for none of them relates to Canada, and
the time for negotiations of new ones un
der the Dingley law has long been passed.
But the President always has the right
to enter into treaty negotiations, and un
der them would not be hampered in doing
so by the limitations of the Dingley law,
which left small scope for the operation
of any treaty negotiated under its pro
visions.
Urge Some Concessions.
Greenough, in speaking of the interests
of his city in the proposed reciprocity,
says that Cleveland is a great manufac
turing city of iron and steel and that the
widest distributions of its products is de
sirable and necessary. The Chamber of
Commerce has already memoralized the
High Joint Commission not to wait in ne
gotiating a treaty till the United States
could secure the best side of every bar
gain, but to concede some things in thÂ«
interest of the general welfare.
Preston points out from his studies of
the old treaty that much of the advantage
is indirect and does not appear in the
figures of exports and imports. Through
reciprocity closer relations would develop,
and this would lead to all sorts of mutual
interchanges to the advantage of both
countries. He says there is great misap
prehension as to the scope of this move
ment; that instead of being a Boston
project it finds the warmest support in all
our commercial cities and is national in its
backing.
ALABAMA ELECTION
RETURNS INCOMPLETE
Everything Indicates, However, That
the New Constitution Has Bsen
Ratified.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.. Nov. 12.â Partial
returns from every county in Alabama
indicate that the new constitution has
been ratified by nearly 30,000 ma;
The black belt counties, where the larg
est majorities for ratification are ex
pected, have been slow to send in re
turns, and when the official count ts
made the majority may go as high as
32,000. All of the white counties have
practically completed the count, and
they voted for the new constitution by
a small majority.
General C. M. Shelley, leader of the
opposition, declares that the State will
cast a majority of at least 20,000 against
ratification. He bases that estimate
upon the returns from North Alabama,
which show Increased majorities against
the new constitution.

TUCSON. Ariz., Nov. 12.â The haciendas
about Guaymas, which have been in a
constant state of terror for the past
mom are now thoroughly alarmed and
the population is Seeing to the city for
protection. Yesterday Don Jesus P. Pal
mas and Leonardo Pablos, prominent cit
izens of Sonora, were murdered by Ya
cjui6. They were riding from Batomatal.
a small place in the Yaoui Valley, above
Guaymas, to the Aguilar Rancho, when
an attack was made upon them. A va
quero who accompanied them had ridden
en ahead to announce their coming at the
rancho. Returning he found his com
panions ct but an -hour before lying dead
on the trail and their horses feeding a
few hundred yards away. Riding back
to Batomatal he gave the alarm and a
few minutes after his arrival a courier
arrived with news That the Indians had
raided Esoeranza rancho and the occu
pants had to flee for their lives. A dis
patch was sent to Guaymas and General
Torres, who recently arrived from Mexico
City, summoned a troop of cavalry and
started in pursuit of the India:
At Santa Maria, a military post. General
Torres was reinforced and the cavalry
scoured the country, finding everywhere
trails of Indians, who had been engaged
in running off large numbers of horses
from ranches in the valley. The Indians
escaped to the fastnesses of El Creston del
Callo Mountain and the troops could not
pursue them into that stronghold, but
General Torres surrounded the mountain,
placing a large force of men at the can
yons where the Indians might come out.
It is believed a battle will soon be fought.
A dispatch printed in El Correo de So
nora. from Batomatal. says that the
rancheros are thoroughly aroused. A
dozen murders have taker, place in a few
weeks and hundreds of horses have been
stolen by the Yacjuls.
When news of his death reached the
widow of Don Palmas she immediately
mounted her horse- and went alter the
body of her husband, accompanied by
vaqueros. It is feared that she, too, will
be killed, as she had not returned at last
reports.
General Torres, or "Don Leonzo," as
he is known there, led the battle which
was waged against the Yaquis a year ago.
when liundreds of Indians were killed and
many Mexican soldiers met death. He
succeeded in driving- the redskins back
end when Chief Tatabite was killed the
war was supposed to have ended and
peace would reign forever. But the Ya
quis returned to their valley only to pre
pare for another war and from their suc
cess in obtaining horses and provisions
it would seem that they are prepared to
fight for many months. They are well
mounted and armed and know" the hiding
places in the country and the places
where they can right to the best advant
age. The war promises to be a bloody
one. > s '
ACCUSATION OF FRAUD
AGAINST AN ATTORNEY
Suit Brought to Set Aside Mortgage
Held by William A. Bowden
of San Jose.
SAN JOSE. Nov. 12.â Charles Newman
and his wife to-day began suit against
William A. Bowden, a prominent attoi
ney of this city, to have a mortgaga
egainst their property set aside, alleging
that it was obtained by misrepresenta
tion. Newman, who conducted a distil
lery, was arrested by the Government
two years ago for violation of internal
revenue laws. He employed Bowden as
an attorney tj defend him. The com
plaint declares that on February IS, ISSCÂ«.
Bowden came to plaintiff and claimed it
was necessary for him to give a bond to
keep him out of "prison. At the same
time, Newman claims. Bowden pre
sented a document for himself and wife
to sign, which the attorney claimed was
a bond. This they readily signed. They
believed this to be a bond until Novem
ber 8, 1901. when they went to pay their
taxes to the Tax Collector. They were
Informed they owed no taxes, as W. A.
Bowden. as mortgagee, had paid them.
Newman claims that Bowden took ad
vantage of his ignorance of the English
language to deceive him. Although
the mortgage calls for interest at 10 per
cent per annum no demand has been
made upon him in the two years inter
vening.
Attorney Bowden, when seen this even
ing, denied the charges of Neuman and
his wife. He said that he defended Neu
man on four charges of violating inter
nal revenue laws. His fee was $$(*>. Neu
man. to secure the fee. executed a mort
gage of $1,000 on his place in Union Dis
trict. Bowden declares that Neuman
knew he was executing the mortgage at
the time he signed it. Only a portion of
the fee has been raid.

DRUNKEN FREAK
IMPERILS LIVES
â -â¢
Intoxicated Man Shuts
Off Air Circulation
in a Mine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 12.â The
craay act of a drunken man imperiled
the lives of 400 miners working in the
coal shafts in Nar.aimo yesterday. Wil
liam Young, himself a miner, was going
home after a spree in town, when he
walked into th-? engine-house at the top
of the new Vancouver Coal Company s
No. 1 shaft. He climbed over two rapid
ly revolving speed belts, and, with th^
infinite .pains which only a drunken man
would take, shut off the steam from th-j
engines, which in another part of tne build
ing operated an immense fan that causes
air to circulate through the mine. Youn.j
then walked from the place as noiseless
ly as he had entered and was seen going
away from the building.
Two minutes later tne chief engineer
was called up by the telephone from thc
lower level of the mine by a frightened
miner, who said that already the men
had become half suffocated for want ol
air in the pit. Ihe engineer at first could
not comprehend what the trouble was,
as the machinery immediately at hand
appeared to be workins in perfect order.
A second message from the mine said
that the men had laid down their tooi3
and that many were too weak to stand.
but they were too well trained to become
panic stricken and the best of order pre
vailed.
Just then the engineer found the turned
off steam pipe t-nd a minute later the cir
culation of air was restored. Young was
arrested and confessed that he had dono
the mischief with a view of closing the
mine, but that he did not realize that ho
was imperiling human life.

TURNER ESTATE
IN THE COURTS
State University Party
to a Three-Cornered
Contest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MERCED. Nov. 12.â A case of unusual
interest has been on trial here before
Hon. E. N. Rector, Judge of the Super
ior Court, for several days. In the mat
ter of the estate of William C. Turner,
deceased, formerly a wealthy pioneer of
Merced County, letters of administration
were granted in 1894 to W. W. Gray by ,
Judge J. K. Law, then Judge of the Su
perior Court. Later it appeared that
Judge Law was the largest unsecured
creditor of Tuiner. He presented his
claim to the administrator whom he #a I
appointed and the administrator allowed
it.
Meanwhile the Regents of the Univer
sity of California, who held a $50,01)0
mortgage on lauds belonging to Turner,
had commenced suit to foreclose, making
Gray, as administrator of Turner's es
tate, the defendant. The foreclosure suit
was about to be tried, when Sidney M.
Van Wyck Jr., the attorney acting for
the university, discovered that Gray had
been appointed administrator by Judge
Law at a time when Judge Law was dis
qualified to act, because of his own in
terest in the case.
The university immediately nominated
Edward W. Putnam to apply for letters
of administration on the ground that the
letter* issued to Gray were void. The
widow, Mrs. Elizabeth Turner, and a
daughter of Turner, Mrs. Harriet E.
Breckinridge, followed suit and applied
for letters to themselves.
All three applications are being heard
together. Testimony has been introduced
by the petitioners and none was offered
In rebuttal, for the facts were not dis
puted. Judge Law applied for leave to
make an argument, saying he was a
creditor and wished to protect his rights
as such.
The argument on behalf of the univer
sity was made by Attorney Van Wyck of
San Francisco. It occupied nearly three
days, in the course of which more than
100 decisions on similar cases in other
States were produced and read. It was
conceded that never before in California
had any court been called to pass upon
the validity of letters of administration
granted by an interested Judge, although
the code provides that no Judge shall sit
in any matter in which he is interested.
Mr. Van Wyck's argument was con
cluded yesterday. An adjournment was
taken until to-morrow, owing to engage
ments of the Tttorncys in the Supremo
Court. Arguments are then to be made
hv Judsre' Law and by Attorneys J. W.
Knnx, Frank H. Farrar and James F
Peck.
Turner's estate was originally valued at
$300,000. but owinsr to large claims of cred
itors, is now Insolvent.
Most of the people do not know where
to secure the Old English Sheffield Plat
ters, Vases and Candlesticks, and The Fe
roza Art Pottery ornaments, which un
doubtedly make the most desirable holi-^,
day presents one can ffive. The P. Rossi
Company's art store, at 229 Sutter street,
is the only art store that carries these
articles, which look very attractive among
the ancient and artistic furniture thertfn
displayed. â¢

WIFE CONDUCTS
HER OWN SUIT
Sensational Action for
Divorce Stirs Town
of Willows.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, Nov. 12.â A sensational di
vorce case is now being heard in Glenn
County's Superior Court behind closed
doors. Mrs. Anna Bane is conducting her
own case against her husband, P. D.
Bane, a prominent farmer, who lives near
Orland. The request Â¦ that the public be
barred from hearing the evidence comes
from the attorneys for the defendant.
Mrs. Bane strongly objected to closing the
doors and willingly talks of her case and
the evidence she will submit.
Mrs. Bane's complaint is a voluminous
affair and recites many alleged acts of
cruelty on the part of her husband, all of
which he denies. In the defendant's crosa
complaint he alleges that his wife wrong
fu.lly accused him of being too friendly
with a young woman formerly employed
on a newspaper at Orland and declares
that his wife told various persons that
this young woman was obliged to leave
town.
All of this Mrs. Bane, in turn, denies in
her answer, but she will try to introduce a
number of letters written by this young
woman to her husband. Some of these
letters, she alleges, address Bane as "My
darling sweetheart" and "Dearest Paul"
and are signed as "Your own," and "With
love." A fight will be made to prevent
the introduction of these warm epistles.
The cisc probably will hinge on an
agreement entered into by Mr. and Mrs.
Bane and signed by each of them in which
they agree to separate, Mrs. Bane to be
allowed $800 and to quitclaim any inter
est in Bane's property. Mrs. Bane claims
that this was abrogated when Bane wrote
to her in May, 1900, Imploring her to re
turn to him and live with him as his wife.
She did return, but he refused to take
her back.
The principals are prominent here and
the case is creating much talk. The
Banes have two young daughters, 5 and
8 years of age, who have been with their
mother.

BERLIN, Nov. 12.â There appears to be

a divorce of the Grand Duke and Grand
Duchess- of Hesse is impending. Incom
patibility of temper, long existing, ap
pears to have reached the point where a
separation is inevitable. They are both
grandchildren of the late Queen Victoria,
who 1 , with the Czar and an extraordinary
assemblage of other sovereigns, was pres
ent at the wedding, which took place
April 19, 1894.
The Grand Duchess is regarded as one
of the most beautiful princesses of Eu
rope. She and the Grand Duke were
estranged during the first year of their
marriage. She left him and went to stay
with her older sister, the Crown Princess
of Roumania. Queen Victoria invited her
and her husband to visit England and
managed to restore a semblance of peace,
but that soon disappeared.

but that plan has been changed and he is
going to Rome before proceeding to the
Philippines.
"I am going to Rome to get instructions
as to my new post." said Mgr. Sbaretti,
"and until then will not know what my
duties are to be. I have read in the news
papers that the Vatican is sending me to
the Philippines to endeavor to arrange an
agreement between the Filipinos and the
American Government. Some papers

CAUSES LEADING
TO DEPRESSION
Industrial Commission
Reviews Agricultural
Situation.
Conservatism of the Farmers
Is Said to Be a Serious
Drawback.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 12.â The Indus
trial Commission to-day made public its
review of the evidence taken before the
commission on the subjects of agriculture
ana agricultural labor. Among other sub
jects discussed is that of*agricultural de
pression, of which the commission speaks
as follows:
The cause most assigned for the depression
of agriculture In the Kastern States is tbe
Increased production due to the opening of
lands in advance of natural demand, especially
through the agency of liberal land laws and
grants of lanu in aid of railroad construction.
The competition has been rendered especially
severe by the policy o>f the railroads in mak
ing freight rates relatively lower on long dis
tances. The oid staple products having thus
become unprofitable In tne East it has been
necessary lor farmers to change their methods
and vary the character of their crops, taking
up especially the culture of products whicu
are not easily transported long distances. Thus
truck farming has largely superseded cereal
growing aiong the Atlantic coast, but farmers
In the North Atlantic States now complain of
the severe competition of States farther south
in this industry, and much the same may be
said of fruit growing. Even so perishable a
commodity as milk Is transported much longer
distances than formerly since the introduction
of refrigerator cars.
Another cause which several witnesses assign
for the unsatisfactory condition of agriculture
in some parts of the country is the conserva
tism of the farmers, their lack of quick adjust
ment to changed conditions and lack of effect
ive business planning. The farmers, as a class,
have not kept up with the times, but have
raised the same crops year after year without
regard to changed conditions. This lack of
managing ability among farmers is especially
emphasized with reference to the Southern
States and Is given as an explanation of too
, exclusive attention to cotton production pre
vailing there.
Another cause assigned for agricultural de
pression In the South Is the scarcity of money,
the difficulty of borrowing on real estate se
curity and the consequent high rates of in
terest. It seems possible, however, to borrow
money in the South at somewhat lower rates
of interest than formerly. The decline in the
price of cotton is another important element in
the depression of agriculture in the South. The
Inefficiency of negro labor is assigned as an
other cause. On the other hand It is affirmed
that there Is too much good and cheap labor
in the South. An abundance of cheap labor is
said to be unfavorable to the success of agri
culture because it results in planting too large
an acreage and in neglect of personal atten
tion by the planter.
Against the charge that farmers are unduly
conservative is put the counter-charge that
they turn from one crop to another without
sufficient regard to the suitability of the cli
mate and soil or to the considerations of the
market.

CARNEGIE INCREASES
HIS PITTSBURG DONATION
Adds Two Million Dollars to His
Original Offer for a Polytech
nical School.
PITTSBURG, Nov. 12.â Just before the
close of an all-afternoon meeting of the
board of trustees of the Carnegie Insti
tute to-day, Andrew Carnegie surprised
and delighted the members present by
the announcement that he had decidcl
to increase by $2,000,000 his already large
donations. Carnegie said he would in
crease his original offer to endow a poly
technical school from $1,000,000 to $2,000.
00, provided the city of Pittsburg
donate a site. His origiqal proposition
was to furnish money for the erection
and equipment of a polytechnical school
at whatever cost the board of trustees
agreed upon and to start it with an en
dowment of $1,000,000. This endowment ho
to-day raised to $2,000,000. Because of the
rapid growth of the institute which com
prises the art. music and literary de
partments, Carnegie said he would in
crease its endowment from $1,000,000 to
$2,000,000.
The board of trustees adopted plans for
the new school and selected a site for the
buildings. The buildings will be modele.l
after the Worcester technical school anJ
the site, comprising eleven acres, lie-s
just west of the Carnegie library build
ing and extending along Forbes avenue
to Boquet street. The city has already

THREE MASKED ROBBERS
ARE FRIGHTENED AWAY
Enter a Store in Jackson Gate, but
Fail to Get the Gold on
Hand.
JACKSON, Nov. 12.â A bold attempt at
robbery was made at 9 o'clock last night
in Chichizola's general merchandise store
in Jackson Gate, one mile from Jackson.
Two men with heads enveloped in masks
entered, revolvers in hand, and command
ed Alfred HaverstJck. a cjprk. to hold up
his hands. Haverstick believed some one
was playing a joke but the command was
repeated in more peremptory terms and
the clerk obeyed.
C. Cuneo. driver of a delivery wagon,
was in the store. Unnoticed by the rob
bers he slipped out the back door. Hear
ing the noise made by him in opening the
door a*d evidently fearing that an alarm
was about to be given, the intruders fled.
A third man was posted on the outside
while the two were inside.
To-day was pay day at the Onelda
mine and Chichizola had a large sum of
coin on hand with which to cash the
checks of the miners. There was $3000 In
the safe and $200 in the till at the timÂ«
the robbers appeared.

PETALUMA GREYHOUNDS SHOW SPEED
AT THE INTERSTATE CLUB MEETING
PETALUMA, Nov. 12.â The Inter
state Coursing Club opened its
annual plains meeting here to
day under favorable conditions.
The weather was all that couli
be desired and a flattering attendance
t-howed that the people of this town will
keep their promise of making the affair a
fuccess. Save for the occasional short
courses, where the hare forgot his speed
until the dogs approached him, the cours
ing was as interesting as the big stakes
at Union Park.
The visitors are unanimous on one
point, and ihat is* that "Denny" Healey,
the local coursing enthusiast, has had
this meeting "up his sleeve" for some
time. According to their way of express
ing it, the Prince of Petaluma has had
hi? greyhounds doing their training over
the big field for many months. With
seven e-ntriee on the card Healey'6 kennel
closed the day without once having a flag
raised against it. Elista, Evangeline,
Tapioca. Fine Form, Tiburon, Sisquoc
and For Glory In turn were returned win
ners, and on each occasion the Petaluma
contingent was lined up at the pool boxes
backing the home dogs." Sisquoc was the
star performer of the string, and in his
course with Commodore Nash was the
favorite at prohibitive odds. Just before
the day's sport was finished Healey's
Champion, was quoted an even-money
choice for stake honors. The hare that
was liberated for the pair was one of the
best of the day. When Sisquoc left the
slips the wise ones from the city looked
.wise and were not slow In expressing the
â¢opinion that the great courser was on
edge and speedy enough for any class.
Up the field at a heart-breaking clip the
fast performer showed his training and
made a bold bid to make the course a
short one. Fast as he was he enuld not
beat the cunning of the hare, lor after
he had scored twice the hare took a spurt
and soon had fifteen yards of daylight
between him and his pursuer. Across the
field and back the dogs were taken in
trying to land the game. Sisquoc got in
and in a rapid working course final
scored the kill.

the contrary, was on his mettle and dis
played considerable cleverness.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYERS
TO REINFORCE ATHLETIC TEAMS
The football game on Thanksgiving day i
between elevens flying the colors of the i
Olympic and the Reliance athletic clubs I
will possibly be a repetition of the inter
collegiate championship game of last Sat
urday. The managers of the rival club
teams have promises from a number of
college men that they will play.
The Olympic Club team will draw its
reinforcements from Berkeley, while
Stanford men will cast in their fortunes
with Reliance. Captain Womble will
surely, play, and Masters of last year's j
team, has also promised to don football ;
armor.
"Dave" Brown goes to Palo Alto to-day
charged with the mission of securing the
assurance of some college players. Fick
ert, who has been coaching Stanford, may
play. "Babe" Burnett, Lee, Slaker and
Parker are also possibilities.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 12.â
The article in last night's issue of an I
evening paper in San Francisco, in which
it was said that Stanford was sore over
her defeat on Saturday, and in which Ho
ran. the former Lafayette guard and ex-
Stanford student, was accused of having
betrayed the signals of the cardinal
eleven to Berkeley, is the one subject of
conversation on the campus to-day.
Stanford students generally have ac
cepted the defeat as a defeat should be
received and are not making 'excuses.
Whatever the students here may think \
about a betrayal of our signals to the ]
California team, no accusation has been
made against any one by the . student
body, nor would it be made without posi
tive proof on- which to base ' an ' accusa
tion. The editorial in to-night's issue of
the Daily Palo Alto, the student organ,
seems to express in general the feeling of
the students. It reads:
Whoever wrote the article for the Evening
Post which is quoted in to-day's issue pre
sumes a good deal on the sentiment of the
Stanford student body. That organization haÂ»
not accused any one of betraying the signals
of its team, nor has it sought excuses to ex
plain the defeat which Us tram suffered. . It has
admitted Berkeley a fair victory; it has ac
knowledged her a superior team. For come
enthusiastic journalist or sensational corre
spondent to show such presumption is surpris
ing to the Associated Students. The body of
Stanford students arc men and women who
can suffer defeat without everlastingly finding
excuses. .
If the anonymous . author had given positive
proof of his statements we would have re
garded the matter differently. But to boldly
print grave accusations presumably supported
by our student body when the sentiment of
that association is quite different is extremely
distasteful. The Daily Palo Alto refutes the
statement and until it has proof that Berkeley
knew our signals refuses to believe she could
be so small and Â¦ dishonorable as to accept
them. " Â¦ â¢ ; : ' Â¦
The students centrally â¢ are indigant
over the insult to Ccach Fickert which
anpeareu last night in an ectoria. in the
Daily Califernian, Berkeley student
daily, 'i.ie head coach was accused >Â£
displaying "-.n unsportsmanlike and tin â¢
gentlemanly spirit" after Stanford's de
feat on the gridiron. The student bod/
regards Coach Fickert's character Â«anil'
sportsmanship as irreproachable, and 1
does not feel that the sentiment ex
pressed by the Californian- represents
that of the University of California stu
dents. . â¢ . .

HARD TRAINING
IS ENDED FOR
BIG GUS RUHLIN
A Short Spin on the
Road This Morning
His Last Work.
Jeffries Continues His Exer
cise and Is in Fine
Condition.
HARRY CORBETT, who will
referee the heavyweight cham
pionship battle Friday night,
stated yesterday that he would
instruct Jeffries and Ruhlin that
they would have to protect themselves in
the clinches. He said:
"There will be no delay when the men
enter the ring. I understand the rules
thoroughly and will instruct them that
they can hit in the clinches. 1 will not,
however, permit one man to hold the
other and then punch him. Either man
may punch if his hands are free and it
behooves the contestants to protect them
selves during the infighting. They win
break when I order them to do so."
Jeffries informed his friends yesterday
that he was doing some light training, but
if the amount of work he accomplished is
taken into account the big fellow did some
heavy work. He arose at 7 o'clock and
after breakfast strolled through the
streets of Oakland. At 10 o'clock he went
to the gymnasium of the Reliance Club
and exercised for two hours. He skipped
the rope, punched the bag for twenty
minutes, pulled and hauled big Bob Arm
strong all over the ring and fought an
imaginary opponent with dumbbells. Jef
fries did not box out of consideration for
his sparring partners' feelings. Arm
strong is suffering from sore hands and
Brother Jack has a few sore spots on his
anatomy that hurt when struck by the
champion.
During the roughing it with Armstrong
the colored man tried to force Jeff's head
back with his elbow. Jim stood the
strain, but after he had finished the work
he expressed a soreness in his "Adam's
apple." in talking he gave the impression
that he had caught cold. Jim said he
simply strained his vocal chords and
would not be able to sing for a few days.
Jeffries attended the theater in the
evening and laughed over the jokes and
witticisms of the comedians. For a man
Â¦who has a big contract on his hands, he is
the most indifferent man in the world.
He allows Billy Delaney. his trainer, to do
the worrying. He knows he is in condi
tion to enter the ring, and having had a
number of championship battles, experi
ences no nervousness ;>s 10 the outcome
of the fight.
Jeffries said he would do some boxing
to-day. He will rest a day before the
fight and expects to go into the ring as
strong as an ox. Every one who has seen
him exercise marvels at his swiftness.
He is extremely fast on his feet and never
tires. That he is hitting with great force
was evidenced by the manner in which he
punched the bag yesterday. He ham
mered the inflated sphere for twenty min
'tes arid broke the rope by heavy smash
ing. <
RUHLIN'S TRAINING ENDS.
Will Now Store Up Vitality for the
Big Fight.
Gus Ruhlin has practically finished his
long siege of training. A little sprint on
the road this morning to round him off
and Gus can then rest easy until Friday
night. Fearful lest some accident might
befall the aspirant for championship hon
ors at the eleventh hour, iJiliy Madden
advised his protege to eliminate his after
noon work in trie gymnasium yesterday.
Instead of the usual hard fie^h-stripping
exercise at the bag and ivith the dumb
bells Gus strollfd off with George La
vigne and took a long walk. Gus was in
excellent spirits ami expressed delight
over the fact that his tedious preparatory
work Is over. Only once did he refer to
the coming tiplit. and then to remark, "I
wish the tight was over."
Ruhlin will be up early this morning,
and after eating' breakfast will start out
on hit- last spin. Madden never believes
in working a man up to the last day of
the fight. Where there Is no weight to
make Billy bplieves that a boxer should
enjoy a day of solid rest before the con
test. A boxer usually gets lidgety and
peevish on the day of the battle and
there is little chance for him to get a
good rert. Ruhliri will come off the road
about 10:30 o'clock this morning, and from
that time until Friday night he will be
kept as quiet as possible.
Billy Madden will leave the training
quarters Thursday morning and come
Into town to look' after the final details of
the big fight. Ruhlin and his trainers,
Charlie Goff and Denver Ed Martin, will
not break camp until Friday noon. They
will be driven into town by Henry
Blanken and will take up their quarters
at one of the hotels.
"You can count on me to give a good
account of myself," said Ruhlin confi
dently. "I know just what kind of a job
I have on my hands and I think I am
equal to the occasion.
"Of course they are betting long odds
against me, but betting or odds don't win
a championship battle. In every cham
pionship fight that has taken place In
this countty the champion was a top
heavy favorite. I would go into the ring
feeling that I was there to win if the bet
ting was 100 to 1 against my chances.
"I never felt like I do now in all my
life. I simply can't express the improve
ment 1 feel the last six months' work has
made In me. Th" climate out here has
agreed with me and T am trained to per
fection. You may pay for me that If the
fight lasts twenty rounds I will get the
decision, and if it ends sooner Jeffries will
be the man on the floor."
What Sporting Men Say.
Here are some expressions of opinion
from well known sporting men:
Eddie Greanyâ lt is no 1" to 4 betting proposi
tion: Ruhlin has a chance.
Alex Greggains â Jeffries, Inside of ten
rounds.
Jack Welshâ Jeffrie?, in from twelve to fif
teen round?.
Billy Lavigne-I think it will be a hard
fight, and will go fifteen rounds or more.
Pe. Witt Van Courtâ Jeffries. The length of
fight will depend upon what tactics Ruhlin fol
lows.
Joe Epringerâ Ruhlin, in twelve rounds or
o'T.
Pam Thallâ Jeffrlpp, in twelve rcunds or ov.er.
Tim McGrathâ It's a toss of a coin. Both are
hig and (strong, making it hard to pick a win
ner.
Andy Gallagherâ Jeffries, in ten to twelve
rounds.
Jlmmie Brittâ Jeffrie?, inside fifteen rounds.
Garnet Fergusonâ Ruhlin, fifteen or over.
Ed (Say Whiteâ Jeffries is a 1 to 20 chance.
George Slierâ Jeffries. I never saw him in
better condition. The fight should be a short
and desperate one.
Fred Belascoâ Nothing to it but Jeffries.
Paul Ridleyâ Ruhlin has a fair chance to
etay twenty rounds and win on points.
John Bellisâ Jeffries, lnpide ten rounds.
Manager Kennedy of the Twentieth
Century Club telegraphed Tom Sharkey
yesterday offering him a match In De
cember with the winner of the fight on
Friday night. Dp to a late hour last
night no word had been received from, the
redoubtable sailor.
Lou Houseman, sporting editor of the
Chicago Inter Ocean, arrived here last
night to report the contest for his paper.
John Bellis of Kansas City, an admirer
of Chemplon Jeffries, arrived yesterday.
He came especially to see the big fight.

BEDECK HAS HIS COLORS LOWERED
BY NANNIE NOLAN, A RANK OUTSIDER
FOREMOST among the upsets in
the heavy, holding footing at Oak
land track yesterday was the de
feat of Bedeck, a 1 to 2 favorite
for the fifth event, by Nannie No
lan, the little brown filly from St. Louis.
The distance was one mile and a six
teenth and, Winnie O'Connor aboard, the
odds-on choice evidently labored under
the impression that he could overhaul
Nannie whenever he got ready. Well
straightened for the wire, O'Connor shook
Bedeck jup and Hoar, did likewise with
the brown filly in front. By this time it
struck O'Connor he had a difficult task
on his hands, but despite air manner of
persuasive urging on his part Nannie won
out by a length. Rush Fields struggled in
a distant third, followed by Bonnie Us
sak, Morinel, Essence and Herculean, i
No other, very warm, favorites were
served at the collation, which was per
haps a ' fortunate circumstance for tho
talent. Short priced horses were not seen
at their best, as J-osie G and- The Singer
were the only favorites to be encased in
brackets. The attendance was large, with
an abundance of coin in the ring. :
Johnny Woods, on Sea Lion in the Blue
and Gold handicap at six furlongs, put
up a capital finish, leading out Diderot
a head. The | last . named three-year-old
at the commencement enjoyed .first call
in the betting, until a plunge on Sea Lion
developed large proportions, sending Cae
sar Young's mud lark to the post a 7 to
5 choice. Hoar, on Diderot, with. Frank
Kenney as close companion, cut out the
running. Squared for home, Kenney had
enough and it looked as if Hoar would
land with his mount. Woods, though, got
up at the paddock with Sea Lion and in
a furious drive won by a head, getting
a well deserved reception from the crowd.
Homestead, â¢ the two-year-old, never cut
any figure and Icicle proved a disappoint
ment. ' . . . ..
Nine maiden two-year-olds started in
the opening scramble. Backed down to
favoritism, Josie G, a filly by Blooms
bury,., defeated the first betting choice
M.tlaspina very easily. Torila, a 20 to 1
shot, ran third.
Billy Magrane's mare Nellie Forest dis
posed of a cluster of cheap ones in the
mile selling run which followed. She was
quoted at 8 and 10 to 1. and led through
out. Billy Moore, the favorite, only
downed The Gaffir a neck for place hon
ors.
Next The Singer, another member of the
Magrane stable, romped home first in the
seven-furlong run, decided under selling
conditions. An 8 to 5 favorite, he
stumbled at the start. losing half a
dozen lengths or more. When 'roe Miller
and Imperious had grown leg weary and
began backing up the favorite experienced
no difficulty in passing them. Imperious
got the place. . Â¦-
El Oriente, a Baldwin stable representa
tive, took the concluding race of the day.
As good as 6 and 8 to 1. the gelding made
all the pace, finishing four lengths before
Dunblane at . the wire. San Venado. the
favorite, could not raise a gallop in the
going.

After to-day's Cabinet meeting it was announced

thousands of Chinese that would come in. He stated that
he knew of other lines that were being organized for the
same purpose.
Powderly has recommended that there be no delay in the
action of Congress.

Stomachs That
Won't Work,
That Retain the Fcod and Refuss to Digest
It. Make the He. a Heavy and the
Nerves Weak. Niel Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
There i? a cure for dyspepsia. Suffer-
er? who have tried noxious nostrums will
probably by skeptical, but skepticism van-
ishes when Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
BOBH^HL Iff i
tried. Whether the trouble is dyspepsia of
long standing, or merely a simple case of
Indigestion, relief is prompt- and pro-
nounced. The less the trouble the fewer
tablets need be taken.
Heaviness after eating, sour stomach,
as indicated by belching, fatigue with
slight exertion or with no exertion at all;
disturbed sleep, nervousness, constipation,
depression, "blues," these things can com-
monly be set down as symptoms of dys-
pepsia. And dyspepsia is merely indiges-
tion in an aggravated form.
By promoting perfect digestion, Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets produce strong nerves.
restful refreshing sleep, pure blood and
good sound healthy flesh. They make the
skin clear, the eyes bright, the mind
cheerful.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a medi-
cine and more than a medicine. They di-
gest the food and make it easy of assimi-
lation and they relieve the inflamed, dis-
eased condition of the membranous lin-
irip? and the glands of the stomach and
bowels. They help the digestive organs
over the hard places and put them into a
healthy, active condition. They effect a
quick and permanent cure. You don't
have to continue taking them forever, still
it is well to have a box handy and take
onf at the first return of the trouble.
Perfectly well people are made sick by
eating too much, or unwholesome food,
but not if they take a tablet after eating.
Treatment with Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets does not necessitate dieting or any
change of habits. They digest the proper
food .-. nd act upon the other kind in such a
way as to make it pass off quickly and
harmlessly. You may eat and drink what
yof. tike, when you like, and as much as
you like if you take a tablet afterward.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold by
all druggists for 50 cents for full size
package.

Trumped Up Robbery Tale.
C. F. Dean, 475 Eddy street, reported to
Policeman Clark early yesterday morninar
that he had been held up and robbed of
$40 by two women and a man near his
home a few minutes after midnight. He
gave an elaborate description of the rob
ben' and the robbers. Captain Seymour
detailed Detective Whittaker on the case,
and Dean, after being cornered, confessed
to him that he had been talking to a
woman in a doorway, and when she left
him he found she had taken two $20 gold
pieces out of his pocket and had left two
silver dollars. That was all there was
to it.

SENT TO JAIL
FOR CONTEMPT
Chicago Judge Punishes
Employes of Chicago
American.
CHICAGO, Nov. 12.â 0n a charge of
contempt of court, Judge Hanecy to-day
sentenced Andrew M. Lawrence, manag
ing editor of Hearst's Chicago American,
to forty days in the County Jail. The
sentence of H. S. Canfield, who wrote the
article objectionable to the court, was
fixed at thirty days in jail. The cases
against S. S. Carvalho, financial manager
of the paper, and John C. Hammond, as
sistant city editor, were dismissed. Judge
Hanecy declared that the cases against
W. R. Hearst, majority stockholder of
the paper; Homer Davenport, cartoonist,
and Clare Briggs, also cartoonist, would
pend until sucn time as these respondents
could be brought into court by the
Sheriff.
Former Governor Altgeld, one of coun
sel for the respondents, entered a formal
exception to the decision.
"This case, I may say," the court re
marked, "is not appealable. You may
file a bill of exceptions for a writ of error,
however. I am willing to delay the serv
ing of the papers on Lawrence and Can
field until you have drawn up your bill."
"We do not feel that we have any fa
vors coming from this court," Altgeld an
swered. "We are much obliged."
The courtroom was crowded to the
limit when Judge Hanecy read the de
cision.
The article in the American upon which
the proceedings in contempt were based
was a criticism of the court's decision on
an application for the forfeiture of the
charter of the People's Gas Light and
Coke Company.
Judge Hanecy said if the matter pub
lished were allowed to go unnoticed by
the court it paved the way for other at
tacks, and that the judiciary, if not held
in respect, would fall, with all democratic
government. The article, the court de
clared, was not merely an attack on the
people and on the court, but a bold
threat to every court. It should, there
fore, not go unpunished.
A few minutes after the rendering of
the decision and the imposition of the sen
tences as to Lawrence and Canfield, Judge
Dunne, upon application, issued a writ of
habeas corpus to them, returnable imme
diately.
When Canfield and Lawrence appeared
before Judge Hanecy this afternoon
ready for commitment to the County
Jail, the court announced that inasmuch
as he understood Judge Dunne had issued
a writ of habeas corpus, before the men
were sentenced he would take no action
in the matter until that writ had been
vacated. It was decided, however, to
hold the writ in abeyance until the com
mitment papers have been made out and
the men delivered into the custody of the
Sheriff. This will probably be done on
Friday morning.

PRISONERS GET
A GUARD DRUNK
John Adams, Soldier,
Goes on Spree With
Charges.
John Adams, a soldier in the Ninety
third Artillery, stationed at the Presidio,
was detailed yesterday to guard two
military prisoners while the latter work
ed near the military reservation. The
prisoners late in the afternoon succeeded
in inducing Adams to accompany them
to a saloon to get a drink. Adams took
more drinks than one, however, and as
the intoxicants exhilarated him he for
got his commission, in so far as he
granted the men permission to accom
pany him downtown to spend the even
ing in revel on the Barbary Coast. When
Police Officers Brady and Ottson came
upon the party one of the prisoners, Wil
liam Cruezay, had made his escape, and
the other prisoner, John Percell, was
telling a mob of spectators that Adams
was the best man on earth, and Adams
himself was brandishing his six-shooter
in a manner not compatible with law
and order.
Special Policeman George Downey saw
the three men as they passed up Jackson
street to the corner of Bartlett alley.
At that point Cruezay ran up in the
direction of Stockton street, and his com
panions did not miss him for several
minutes. Adams became furious when
he found that his charge, whom he had
treated with such consideration, had
taken advantage of him, and. drawing his
revolver, threatened to send a volley of
bullets after him. Percell was trying to
quell Adams' resentment of his fellow
prisoner's conduct by telling the crowd
what a good fellow the guard was.
Officers Ottson and Brady arrested both
men for drunkenness, and when the
story of their adventure became known
Sergeant Donovan and Officer John Ma
loney placed a charge of desertion
against Adams. Cruezay has not yet
been captured.

TO CURE DANDRUFF.
It Is Necessary That the Dandruff
Germ Be Eradicated.
"Destroy the cause, you remove the ef-

druff, falling hair and baldness, you will
have no more dandruff and your hair
must grow luxuriantly. Herpicide not
only contains the dandruff germ destroy-
er "but it is also a most delightful hair
dressing for regular toilet use. No other
hair preparation is on this scientific ba-
sis of destroying the dandruff germ, and
none other claims to be, for the simple
reason that it is only recently that a de-
stroyer of the germ has been discovered
â Newbro's Herpicide, the only hair prep-

DYSPEPSIA
CURE
When Prof. Munyon says his Dyspepsia Car*
will cure indigestion and all forms of stomach
trouble he simply tells the truth. It will cure a
stomach that has been abused by over-eating and
over-drinking. It will cure a stomach that has
been weakened by old-style drugs. It will do much
toward making an old stomach act like a sound one.
At all druggists, 25 cents. Fifty-six other cures.

TJ3E "WIRELESS" AT WORK
EXPERIMENTS in dispatching weather reports
fep wireless telegraphy from the Farallones to
Joint Reyes are now in operation. A skilled
txpevt, who has had practice :n the new system of
telegraphy in the East, has been sent out by the De
partment of Agriculture to install the service, and he
ow operating it. We have therefore virtually at
d the wireless telegraphy for which The Call has
s-o long worked, and which has been so much desired
not by the weather bureau only, but by all persons
who are interested in shipping and shipping news.
The 6ubject has been so fully discussed that the
public is familiar with the benefits that may be ex
pected to accrue from the new service. Hereafter
we shall receive much earlier notice of the arrival
of shipping under any conditions of the weather, and
in time, of fog the benefits will Tie exceptionally
great.
With the installation of the system there will of
course come the adoption of it on all important ves
sels, so that it will be possible for them to communi
cate with the Farallones and both give and receive
news long before they enter port. That in itself will
be an immense advantage and will far more than re
â¢he cost of the service to the Government.
While the benefits which the wireless system of
telegraphing will confer upon the shipping interests
of the port are thus apparent to the understanding of
it is not to be overlooked that the service has
been installed by the Department of Agriculture and
is designed primarily to assist the weather bureau in
making forecasts of the movements of rains, storms
and winds. One of the difficulties with which the of
ficer? of the bureau have had to contend on this
coaf-t ha? been that of getting any sort of informa
tion concerning the weather to the west of us.
Storms and rains and fogs would come out of the
ocean without any warning coming to the weather
Â¦k. The station at the Farallones will afford
â¢ j-ome help in dealing with that difficulty. It will en
able the forecast officer to learn earlier than he has
been able to do in the past what sort of weather is
â¢he ocean in our vicinity and in what direction its
winds are moving.
Great as are the immediate benefits to be expected
of wireless telegraph service from the Farallones to
city, they are sure to be exceeded by the bene
fits which will be obtained in the future. The new
style of telegraphy is yet in its infancy. It is but a
few years ago that The Call achieved for the first time
in history the feat of obtaining news by that system
clegraphing. and when the feat was accomplished
it was met by a storm of ridicule by the yellow press.
Now the system is in operation at all the great ports
of the world, and on the Atlantic nearly every
large steamer and many smaller ones are equipped
with it. It is hard to set limits to the expanding
usefulness of such a system as this, and it may be
accounted certain that the benefits flowing from it
will steadily increase for many a year to come.
The Buffalo Exposition lost money, while that at
Glasgow is said to have yielded a surplus of some
thing more than $500,000, but then Buffalo has the
satisfaction of knowing she had an electric exhibit
that beat the world and that money couldn't pay for
anywhere else.
It has been stated that the immediate cause of the
death of Li Hung Chang was excitement caused by a
wrangle with the Russians over the Manchurian
question, and it is probable a good many more men
will perish over that same issue before it is settled
It is stated that at the automobile show in New
York the new machines were heavier than the old
patterns, but that does not look like improvement in
the righ-' direction.
There seems to be nothing of Democracy left ex
cept the Solid South, and that is solid only on the
race Question.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1901.
RANGE LEASING.
THE San Francisco Post raises its editorial voice
to a great height against what it supposes a lease
law will be, to compel stock-owners to pay for
their use of the public domain as a range. Inasmuch
as when such a law was proposed in Texas the big
stock men fought it, and as they fought the leasing
policy adopted by the Northern Pacific Railway, and
in each case the plan carried by the support of the
small stock men and actual settlers, it would be easy
for us to say that the Post's opposition is influenced
by the big stock men, who don't want to pay for
pasture, and urtder the present lawless rule of the
free range have the force to exclude the small stock
men entirely. But we don't say that, for we don't
believe it. The Post is influenced by a partial and in
sufficient view of conditions and an entire misappre
hension of what the leasers want.
No such law as the Post describes could ever pass
Congress. Indeed, it is doubtful if it would receive
the courtesy of reference to a committee. Primarily
it is the irrigators who want a lease law, in order to
check the present decrease of moisture available to
make fertile land for cultivation. The physical re
sults of free use of the arid public domain are the
cause of the greatest solicitude on the part of the ob
servers of the conditions on which settlement of the
West depends. W'heti it is known that removal of
the protection of moisture even in States like New
York is decreasing the fertility of the soil, so that
that State, when almost too late, has been compelled
to put public authority forward to arrest aridity, one
may estimate the need of a policy of conservation in
the arid country west of the one hundredth meridian.
Such policy is impossible as long as the stock
range is free. If free it is overstocked, the vegetable
cover of the soil which protects moisture is destroyed
and the desert appears. Vast tracts in Arizona, New
Mexico, Utah and Eastern Oregon have been de
stroyed by this process. The amount of stock fed on
the range decreases every year, and as the range is the
most economical producer of beef, that food is rising
in price to the level of a luxury. What remedy is
there? None is proposed except that which re
deemed the grazing country of Australia and has re
newed the ranges of Texas. This was done by leas
ing the range, compelling payment for its use and
renewing its forage and capacity to carry stock. No
law on the subject can pass Congress that does not
leave every foot of the public domain open and free
to homestead and mineral entry, protect the entry
man by forfeiting the lease of any leaseholder who in
terferes with him, and that does not amply and ade
quately protect the present agricultural settler and
freeholder and every stock-grower, down to the
least.
To say that.,stich a law cannot be drawn is to de
nounce us as inferior to the Australians and Texans
and the land men of the Northern Pacific Railway.
All of these did it, and now neither settler nor free
holder nor small stock man would in either case re
turn to the free and lawless range if he could. It is
too much the fashion to denounce great public poli
cies that concern the physical conditions of the coun
try. Even yet the forest reservations are bitterly at
tacked in many parts of the country, but. usually by
men who consult some selfish interest opposed to the
public good.
Many public interests demand that the men who
use the public domain shall pay for its use. The con
sumers of beef, who find it rising steadily in price,
require the restoration of economy in its production.
The irrigators have a right to use the public do-
Vnain as a producer of revenue to provide irrigation
works, and to this end to compel its users to pay
rent. The domain belongs to the people. A few
thousand of them have grown rich by its use free of
cost, and in using it free they are destroying it for
settlement by turning it into a desert. There seems
no valid argument against leasing. If the anti-leasers
will concede that a law can be framed protective of all
rights, and will then look for reasons why this should
not be done, they will be doing a public service, for
the public want to ki>ow if any reason exists why
such a law shall not pass.
Roosevelt's Thanksgiving proclamation was issued
at a time when most Americans were so busy with
politics that they had little attention to give to any
thing else, and consequently it may be just as well
to remind the public that among other things he
said: "We can best prove our thankfulness to the
Almighty by the way at which on this earth and at
this time each of us does his duty to his fellow man."
BRYAN NOT POPULAR.
THE elections for the year are over. The issues,
where not local, were the same as in 1896 and
1900. By the national platform, the utterances
of President McKinlty and the expression of State
platforms the Republican party stood committed to
sound money, commcicial expansion, well adjusted
protection and the re-creation of our merchant
marine, and there was no break on the line any
where.
Mr. Bryan made his final campaign in opposition
to these principles, and lost on the field which he
chose to battle for. It is remarkable that lowa was
the only State in which the Democracy clung to
Bryanism. He entered that State for an extensive
campaign. His appearance at once produced such
division and dissatisfaction that the candidate lor
Governor publicly objected to it, and as Bryan per
sisted notwithstanding his protest, the State Com
mittee formally disavowed any responsibility for
Mr. Bryan, his appointments and his meetings. This
was not enough. Bryan made his campaign and the
party went into paralysis. The Republicans cast a
larger percentage of the vote than at any election
since the Civil War, and had a majority close to
100,000. Now that it is over many who were silent
in their indignation outspokenly attribute the result
to Bryan's presence. Only six counties were car
ried by .Mr. Phillips, and parts of the local tickets
were lost in some of these.
In his own State Mr. Bryan fared no better,
though he made an airtight fusion with the Populists
and other elements of discontent. It is now apparent
that whatever new alignment may appear in our fu
ture politics, it will not be affected by Bryanism.
Nor will it likely reflect the peculiar views of the
Quincy Democracy of Massachusetts. Perhaps the
generation now active need not concern itself about
such alignment at all, since it is apparent that until
1908 the country .is sure to remain under Republican
control. Mr. Bryan has all the time failed to appre
ciate that his leadership in the last two Presidential
campaigns has driven vast numbers of the Northern
flkmocracy bodily into the Republican party, and
they show no signs of coming out again. They
were the thinking men who had reached the age of
judgment and discretion, and who find at their age
that it is useless to go back and participate in any
attempt at rehabilitation of their old party.
Their example has influenced almost an equal num
ber of younger men, so that there is provided a sort
of perpetual succession to the come-outers of 1896.
When the Republican party is beaten it will be by
some great schism in its own ranks, and the cause of
such a division does not appear now by any analysis
of existing conditions.
The party will go forward in the path ftiat it has
steadfastly followed, fortunate in having so far at
tracted to it the best and highest elements from the
ranks of its opposition.
There was a time that the Democracy consisted of
the Southern States and New York City. Now this
combination is broken, for it is proved that that party
can no longer rely on New York City/ either in Pres
idential or local elections, and the party takes on
more and more the appearance of a purely sectional
organization, with the race question as its sole ex
cuse for existence.
This winter will probably see the final victory of
an isthmian canal and its necessary collateral, the re
creation of a merchant marine, both as Republican
achievements.
President Roosevelt's policy will satisfy the, aspira
tion of the country for the control of the trusts by
curbing their power for harm and destroying their
stimulus of speculation. Then what is left? Mr.
Bryan may continue to talk about our commercialism
and putting the dollar above the man, but Republican
policy will continue to make more dollars per man
than the country ever had before, and make it easier
for the man to get them than ever before.
Here is a Pennsylvania story showing a variety of
life in the good town of Wilkesbarre: Two women
quarreled so often and so loudly over their back
fence that the neighbors put up a fence sixteen feet
high and warned the women not to break it down.
The women were unable to see each other any more,
but they found a knothole in the fence and shouted
scoldings through that. Thereupon the neighbors
appointed a committee to inform the women that un
leÂ»s they quit wrangling they would be run out of
town. It is in that way the Pennsylvanians maintain
their reputation for peace and quietness.
THE RECIPROCITY CONVENTION.
ON next Tuesday there is to assemble at Wash
ington City a gathering to be known as
"The National Reciprocity Convention/ It
is not to be representative of the people as a whole,
nor even of all the great interests of the people,
the membership being confined to those "actively
engaged as principals o- executive officers in manu
facturing firms or corporations." That means, of
course, that the object of the convention is to get
together a number of manufacturers who can be
united in favor of a programme of reciprocity and
then make use of the organization in promoting re
ciprocity treaties.
While it is the belief that the convention will de
clare in favor of a system of reciprocity treaties that
will open foreign markets for our manufactured
goods, no matter at what cost to other industries,
it is by no means certain it will do so. Upon the
vexed question of reciprocity the manufacturers are
themselves divided. Mr. Carnegie, for example, has
â¢recently pointed out that reciprocity would be diffi
cult to devise and more difficult to maintain. Never
theless, at the annual meeting of the National Asso
ciation of Manufacturers there was disclosed a strong
sentiment in favor of reciprocity, and accordingly
those who believe the convention will support a pol
icy of that kind are not without good reasons for
their opinion.
It is to be remembered that Republican reciprocity
was defined in the platform adopted by the National
Convention at Philadelphia in these words: "We
favor the associated policy of reciprocity so directed
as to open our markets on, favorable terms for what
we do not ourselves produce, in return for free for
eign markets." If the manufacturers ask for that
kind of reciprocity there will be no objection on the
part of any stanch Republican protectionist. If,
however, they ask for a reciprocity that would ex
pose our wool, fruit and sugar or other industries to
ruinous competition in order that they may obtain
freer markets for manufactured goods in Argentine,
FYance and Germany, then there will be objection.
The object of calling the convention to meet at
this particular time at Washington City was undoubt
edly that of enablirig it to exert influence upon Con
gress in favor of the pending reciprocity treaties.
Those treaties have long ago been weighed by the
people and condemned by the voice of those who are
best fitted to pronounce judgment upon fiscal mat
ters. Senator Aldrich has emphatically declared
against them, and Senator Hoar some months ago
expressed a dislike of any kind of reciprocity on the
ground that it would take our tariff regulations out
of the hands of Congress and place them in the
hands of the State Department. If we undertake any
extensive system of reciprocity treaties, then we must
surrender our control of our tariff and leave it to be
a matter of barter with the diplomats of foreign na
tions.
With such valid objections against them the reci
procity treaties already submitted to the Senate were
virtually dead. Indeed, some of them are really dead
because of the lapse of the time allowed for the rati
fication. The defeat of the existing treaties, how
ever, would not prevent the negotiation of new ones,
and consequently the forthcoming convention of so
powei ful a body as that of the manufacturers of the
country to consider the policy of reciprocity becomes
an event of the first megnitude. The proceedings will
be watched with interest by the country at large,
and by none more keenly than by those who would
like to break down the whole protective system, and
who are quite ready to make use of reciprocity as a
means of doing it.
It is stated there are 24,000 legitimate physicians
and 6000 quacks practicing medicine in the German
empire. The proportion of four to one in favor
of legitimacy could hardly be matched anywhere
else. In this country, if any comprehensive census
could be obtained of all. who carry on some kind of
quackery in curing disease it would probably be
found that, the quacks exceeded the legitimate doc
tors in number instead of being equal only to one
fourth of them.
Malvar, the Filipino insurgent who has just issued
a proclamation announcing himself as captain gen
eral and reorganizer of the Filipino army, has doubt
less the satisfaction of knowing that the appointment
was unanimous, for it appears he' consulted no one
but himself in regard to it.
We are going to hear a good deal about reciprocity
this winter, but it is not likely any of it will be put
into practice for the simple reason that none of it has
yet been devised that is worth practicing.
The Boers continue to show an ability to give the
British every now and then a surprise that jars a
whole regiment.
PLANS MADE FOR A SPLENDID
M'KINLEY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
PROPOSED NEW HOSPITAL AT NARBERTH, PA.. AS IT WILL APPEAR WHEN COMPLETED. MANY INNO
VATIONS WILL BE INTRODUCED, AND IT IS SAID THE INSTITUTION WILL BE THE FINEST OF ITS
KIND IN THE WORLD. Â»
LAND valued at $14,000 has been purchased at Narberth,
Montgomery County, Pa., as a site for a McKinley
Memorial Hospital which will cost $300,000. In planning
the structure the architect has paid careful attention
to the three great canons of the professionâ utility, sta
biMty and attractiveness.
The style of the building will be of the Greek order. The
plans provide for the erection of three fireproof main build
ings, one for diphtheria, one for scarletina and one for small
pox, and three isolated cottages, each containing four rooms,
for the treatment of other contagious diseases. The three main
buildings will be built of brick and terracotta and identical in
construction, being sixty-five feet wide and one hundred feet
long, with an administration building in front, in which will
be located the quarters of the resident physicians, the nurses
and employes.
In the rear, or wings, are to be located the quarters for
the patients. Here many innovations will be introduced.
Novel methods of sanitation and medical treatment will
form a feature of this hospital. The floors, waDfl and ceilings
will be of enamel cement. In each room will be a small lobby
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
WEAK LUNGSâ S. F. T. C, City. The
best places in the State of California for
people with weak lungs are those which
are distant from the ocean breezes.
TRANSPORTSâ T. C. G.. Oakland, Cal.
For positions in the United States trans
port service make application at the office
at Folsom-street wharf, San Francisco.
HOOP SNAKEâ Subscriber. City. The
abastor erythrogrammus, or so-called
hoop snake, possesses none of the re
markable qualities attributed to it by tra
dition. The statement that when danger
approaches it takes the end of its tail
in its mouth, forms a complete hoop and
then rolls away is mere fiction.
YACHTSâ A Subscriber, San Rafael,
Cal. Any first class bookseller can pro
cure- for you books on the building of
yachts. There have been published a
number of articles on that subject in
periodical literature during the past few
years. Such can be traced by examining
Poole's Index of Periodical Literature, to
be seen in any of the libraries.
PROPERTYâ SiIma, Dixon. Cal. In
California if the wife dies the entire com
munity property passes to the surviving
husband without administration. If the
wife is possessed of separate property it is
subject to her testamentary disposition.
If she flies intestate and leaves a husband
and but one child, the property goes to
the surviving husband and child, share
and share alike.
HIGH SCHOOL FRATSâ B., Santa
Clara, Cal. If a number of young men
of a high school desire to organize a chap
tor of one of the high school fraternities
they should communicate with one
already in existence and frpm the secre
tary obtain all information as to mode
of procedure to have the chapter insti
tuted.
AUTHOR "WANTEDâ Q., City. This :
correspondent's desire is to know who :
was the author of the following. Can any
oi the readers of this department furnish ;
the information?

FEDERAL CIVIL SERVICEâ A. L..
Oakland., Cal. For information in regard
to appointments and percentage of those
appointed in a branch of the Federal Gov
ernment, make application at the depart
ment in which the appointments were
made. If there is any good reason why
the information asked for should be fur
nished it probably will be given, but as a
rule the departments do not answer ques
tions to satisfy mere curiosity.
MOLL PlTCHEÃâ Vallombrosa, Mendo
cino County, Cal. The woman known in
American history as "Moll Pitcher" was
born in Pennsylvania. Her name was
Mary Ludwig, daughter of John George
Ludwig, who came to this country from
Germany with the Palatines. She was a
servant in the family of General William
Irvine at Carlisle, Pa., and married a
barber named John Hays July 24, 1769.
On December 1 he was commissioned
gunner in Proctor's First Pennsylvania
artillery, Continental line. When he went
into active service she followed him. as
did the wives of many soldiers, doing
laundry work for the officers. At the bat
tle of Monmouth she carried a pitcher
giving water to the soldiers and from that
fact she was called Moll Pitcher. When
her husband was killed at his post she
took his place and her conduct so pleased
General Greene that he introduced her to
General Washington, who made her a
sergeant. She was pensioned by the Gov
e) nment, afterward married Sergeant
George McCaulley, died at the age of 79,
and the citizens of Cumberland County,
Pa., erected a magnificent monument to
her memory.

particular department, thus obviating the danger attendant
upon the carrying of articles from one sickroom to another.
The system of ventilation will be an entirely new one. The
windows will be made immovable and at the base of each
there will be placed a layer of compressed cotton, through
which the air will niter. Under each patient's bed there will
be a register, connecting with a shaft, through which the air
will be sucked by means of electrical fans and carried to t
centrally located power house, where, after passing through
a furnace, it will be purified and rind its way out through -cW
chimney. This system will be so devised as to furnish a com- "
plete change of air in every room at least every ten minutes.
Another new feature will be a system of communication
between the patients and their friends. A telephone will be
placed in every room and the visitors will be a'ole to converse
with the sick from a lodge on the grounds without running
the slightest risk of contagion.
The buildings when completed will be the finest of their
kind in the world.

RIOT AND MUTINY BUT NO BLOODSHED
ABOARD THE BRITISH SHIP ANGLESEY
Offic/al Report of the Voyage Says Nothing of Trouble, but the
Captain and Crew Tell Quite Conflicting Stories, the Skip
per Alleging Insubordination and the Sailors Drunkenness
THE BRITISH SHIP ANGLESEY UNDER STORM CANVAS OFF THE HORN. WHILE THE SHIP WAS IN DIS
TRESS AND THE MIZZEN ROYAL WAS BEING FURLED ONE OF THE MEN REFUSED DUTY, AND IN
CONSEQUENCE THERE WAS TROUBLE THEREAFTER.
JUDGING from, the captain's report
of the British ship Anglesey, no
one would ever think there had
been any trouble aboard. Never
theless, there was mutiny, trouble
In the cabin, trouble in the 'midship
room, trouble in the forecastle and trouble
all around. At different times at lenst
one-half the crew was in irons, while the
captain walked the poop with a brace of
pistols in his pockets and a cutlass at his
side. Men were "ironed" daily and the
steward was put in the "brig" because he
did not furnish ham and eggs for
breakfast. Others were "spread-eagled "
vn the cabin floor and all in all there were
lively times on the Anglesey.
In the official report of the voyage no
mention is made of troubles aboard or
about troubles to come. Still the men
have a tale to tell, as has also Captain
Lewis, who said:
"There was an element of discord
aboard when the ship left Swansea. Mc-
Donald, one of the sailors, was particu
larly obstreperous and on several occa
sens had to be disciplined. Finally when
we- were off Staten Island he grew inso
lent and was put in irons by my orders.
He had been sent aloft to furl the mizzen
royal and did the Job in a slovenly man
ner. The vessei was being reduced to
short canvas and a badly furled sail
meant trouble in the coming gale. I or
dered him aloft again and he refused.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1901.
Tlien when I insisted he rushed at me
and nearly killed me with a kick. I was
laid up for several days and when again
able to appear on deck found the whole
of the starboard watch in a mutinous
condition. The trouble was smoothed
over and we crossed the line in fair time
and were off the Farallones a week ago.
Then the trouble broke out again and at
one time 1 had over half a dozen of the
men in irons. Half the time I had to walk
the deck with two pistols in my pocket
and a cutlass at my side, but even then
they nearly made a coup. As it is, every
man of them will be turned over to the-
English Consul and they will have to
answer at home for their crimes.''
The men tell a different story. They say
that off the Platte the ship was caught in
a gale and the captain got a sousing. He
took a glass of grog to drive out the chills
and then went on a "jag," which lasted
the remainder of the voyage. For a
trivial offense he triced up McDonald and
ke;it him with his toes just touching the
deck, while the vessel was rolling her
yardarms undez 1 . They also assert that
Steward Woodward was kept in confine
ment for twenty-four hours because he
did not l'urnish ham and eggs for
breakfast in midocean. The Anglesey did j
not bring any chickens from Swansea-
Sailor Catteau was stretched out on the
cabin lioor and made into a "spread agle"
because he did not obey promptly when
ordered.
Sailor Goodwin, colored, was placed 'n
irons because he did not go to work when
sent forward. Goodwin got his finger In
jured in the winch and for three days he
could not stop the bleeding, so say the
men. Finally he went to the captain and
the latter ordered him back to work. The
negro refused and was placed under ar
rest.
When the Golden Gate was reached
eight of the crew were in the brig and
one man was triced up amidship. The
police went aboard and the men were re
leased and quietly went back to work.
They vow that they will not leave the
Anglesey until she is back in England,
and that then she will be the source of
an inquiry that will mean the captain's
retirement. In the meantime the captain
holds the whip hand.
REINSURANCE AGAIN.
Rcanoke Once More Comes to the
Front as Overdue.
The A/nerican ship Roanoke, now out
153 days from Norfolk, Va. , for San Fran
cisco, is again deemed a risk by the gam
blers. Away back in August last she was
nearly given up as lost because a home
ward-bound steamer reported a wooden
American vessel afire off the coast of
Virginia. At that time 45 per cent was
paid on her. Then she was spoken off the
Platte and the reinsurance dropped out
of sight. Again her owners got scared
and the rate on her was once more quot
ed as high as 35 per cent. This figure
dropped to 8 per cent Monday, when the
news of the vessel having been spoken oft!
Staten Island was received.
There came another reaction yesterday
when people realized the long run th.i
Roanoke was making from Staten Island
in the Atlantic to San Francisco and rate*
accordingly advanced to 15 per cent. The
gamblers have still an opportunity to
play the ship.
The Torridon, now out 02 days from
Newcastle. Australia, for Astoria, is
quoted at 10 per cent, and the Penthesilea,
172 days from England for San Francisco,
is quoted at the same figure.
Water Front Notes.
Max Kalish, the popular manager of tba
Humboldt Steamship Company, is back
from the Sound. Rumor has it that he
and his associates will build or purchase
a new flier for the Sknguay run this win
ter.
The tug Sea Prince dirt a little damage
to Beale-street wharf Monday. She was
docking the schooner Lottie Carson and
the swift tide carried vessel and tug
down on the dolphin. The latter was
wrecked and several piles and stringers
were carried away.
The skiff stolen from the schooner
Henry Sunday night was found moored
under Fremont street by the police yes
terday.
Fifteen boxes of oranges that came
from Mexico were burned by the horti
cultural inspector yesterday. They were
all infected with the orange maggot.

RED FLAG DOES
NOT COME DOWN
Old Signal to Mariners
of ComiDg Storms
to Remain.
McAdie Tells of Plans of
Weather Bureau's Coast
Service,
Forecast Official McAdie says that the
storm signals that are hoisted on the
Mills building by the United States
Weather Bureau to notify shipping of the
approach of storms will not be discon
tinued. There will be no change in the
flags that are employed directly for the
benefit of the maritime interests of the
ports of the United States. Mr. McAdie
makes this statement for the reason that a
contrary impression has obtained among
the shipping men of this port.
Mr. McAdie says tnat certain flags that
have been in use ever since the institu
tion of the weather service of the United
States have been dropped. The reason id
that their place has been supplied by
other and more efficient means of com
munication with those who are princi
pally concerned. The discontinuance took
effect in the East, so far as temperature
and rainfall signals are concerned, as far
back as last July. The change in th:s
city involved in this omission was not
noticed, naturally enough, until the com
ing of the present rainy season. Nov/
warnings of rain and lower temperature
are sent out to the farmers and to interior
towns and also to the residents of San
Francisco and other cities through the
agency of thousands of postal cards anU
through .notifications to business houses
and Postmasters, with the request that
t!ie information shall be posted in a prom
inent, place. The telephone and telegrauh
are also -used. The most effective way "oi
reaching the public, though, is through
the newspapers.
Instead of curtailing the service of no
tifying the shipping of approaching storms
ir this State, there has been planned an
extension by the letting of a contract for
the location of three 60-foot steel towers
for the display of red flags to warn the
mariners. One of these towers will be
placed at Point Lobos, one at Point Reyes
and one at Santa Barbara. The old red
iag will fly at all places where it has
been displayed heretofore.

WIFE CHARGES
GREAT CRUELTY
Mrs. Mary Laveira Al
leges Husband Bru
tally Beat Her.
Mrs. Mary J. Laveira of San Leandro
is suing her husband, Jose Laveira, for di
vorce on the ground of extreme cruelty.
If the allegations she makes in her com
plaint are true she has endured brutal
treatment enough to drive a dozen women
to suicide. She was married to Laveira in
1554 and has borne him eleven children,
each of whom is now over 21 years of age.
One of her sons is named as a defendant
in the suit she instituted yesterday. The
mother alleges that the father by deeding
to the son property valued at $5000 en
tered into a scheme to defraud her of her
share.
Mrs. Laveira's complaint is a tale of
brutality such as is seldom heard or read
in any divorce court. She commences by
alleging that in the year 1363, while she
was living at Antioch, her husband beat
her with a lariat unril she was so badly
b-L'ised that she was compelled to re
main in bed for several days. A rope was
evidently Laveira'.s favorite weapon, for
in 1865, alleges Mrs. Laveira. he beat her
most cruelly with a rope's end. In lSbti.
she alleges, he came home one night and
beat her to such an extent that she was
compelled to flee to her neighbors for
safety, and in IS6T. still further alleges
Mrs. Laveira, her husband attacked her
again and beat her so cruelly that she
saved her life only by running from the
he use in her night clothes and seeking
itfuge with friends. She remained away,
she alleges, for three days on this occa
sion, but he came after her and after mak
ing numerous promises to mend his ways
prevailed upon her to accompany him
home. Hardly had they reached the house,
she alleges, when he turned upon her,
struck her and kicked her and then pro
ceeded to choke her.
Two months after the birth of one of
her children, in IS6S, alleges the wife of
Laveira. he beat her so brutally that she
was again compelled to flee to her neigh
bor's house, taking her child with her.
He pursued her. she alleges, with, a pistol
and dogs and threatened to kill her unless
she returned to him. She did so, she al
leges, after he had made many promises
of reformation, but he failed to keep them
and a short time after their arrival home
commenced his inhuman treatment.
The Laveiras are wealthy. They are at
present living in Livermore. Mrs. Laveira
alleges in her complaint that In addition
to the property deeded to her son George

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 12.â There v.as rather less
buying demand, and rather more irregularity in
the stock market from the outlet to-day. The
hesitation in the advance crew and turned to
sharp reactions in tije iate dealings. Selling
to take fronts was joined to extensive suoic
lines put out by the bear party on the argu
ment that the rise in prints alter enduring lor
so great a length of time must have made the
market vulnerable to attack, but there still
were persistent points vi strength in the mar
ket, and aunjugn the extreme advances in the
strong stocks were notably curtailed, many of
than have considerable net cam.-? ij show for
the day.
The local traction stocks were conspicuous
examples. in Metropolitan the advance reached
3vÂ» at one time, and in Brooklyn Transit t-%.
while the net trams are 2% for Metropolitan
Street Railway and 1-* for Brooklyn Transit.
The anthracite and soft coal carriers selling
below i.iar also showed continued strength, as
did me iron and steel industrials. The dispo
sition to take attractive urorits as the consid
erable advance in i.rice which has occurred
wa3 emphasized by the expectation that sev
eral millions or gold will go out this week on
Thursday to Paris and on Saturday, probably,
to London, as the rate of sterling exchange
to-day advanced to a point which makes gold
exports to London direct profitable. The
strength of starling here was in spite of earler
money rates both in London and in Berlin and
a relaxation of the Continental pressure upon
London gold. The necessity of a large move
ment of gold from New York at this time of
year calls renewed attention to the extent of
the American borrowings in Europe earlier in
the year with the expectation that our foreign
trade balance would continue so favorable that
these leans could be raid at a profit out of the
abundance of the foreign exchange bills In
New York. The fact that this expectation has
not been realized and that exchange bills are
scarce owing- to the falling ofT in oil export
traae causes some surmise whether the high
prices of stocks reached earlier in this year did
not alto represent undue expectation. In the
present movement more than one stock has
reported a record price and all stocks are un
deniably high-priced. On the other hand the'
extraordinary railroad earnings and trade ac
tivity are naturai incentives to speculation.
To-day's return of gross earnings tor the first
we?k in November show such increases over
last year as 53 per cent for Rio Grande West
ern. 22 per cent for Chicago Great Western, 31
per cent for Canadian Pacific, 17 per cent for
Wabaeh, 15 per cent for Chicago and Eastern
Illinois and 9 per cent for St. Paul. The Gov
ernment (stimate on the corn crop, although
it offered no very unexpected information, re
newed the depressing influence of the heavy
shortage in the crop, and the corn-carrying
railroads in the West and the Southwest were
therefore most acutely affected by the profit
taking. The cut in th? price of susrar espec
ially effected that stock. The market closed
active and weak.
There was another lanre day's business In
bonds, but t!".e Mice movement mi irregular.
Total sales, J5,250,CC0.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 12.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's Ixindon cablegram says: The stock
market to-day was quiet, American shares
waiting settlement for the Northern Pa
cific. They hung around parity and closed
heavy on the dullness of New York, but
finally rallied on the curb, the features being
Erie preferred and Canadian stocks. New York

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. 12.â 1n the absence of any
definite support the trade of the wheat pit
resolved itself Into a steady decline. Both
Liverpool and Paris cables were lower and
this started the trading with a decline of %@%c
to %@%c for December at 72%<g>72%c. News
from Argentina told of too heavy rains and
on short covering and a light commission
house demand early the indications were that
business would have an upward trend. Al
most immediately, however, a stream of wheat
began coming out and prices sagged rapidly.
Primary receipts were more than double those
of the same day a year ago. Clearances were
small and Bradstreet's reported the world's
visible increase at 3,000,000 bushels. Chicago
stocks were considerably increased and the
stream from the Northwest was unabated.
Then the commission-houses stopped buying
and turned sellers and the only support came
from the pit itself. A quantity was absorbed
to stop the decline but this came out later
and December sold down to 71% c, closing weak,
1%@1%c lower at 71% c.
Corn was heavy, influence of the Government
report on the crop condition being blamed for
much of the weakness. The drain in wheat
added another straw to weaken the market
and December closed at the bottom, weak,
1%Â®1% lower at 58%@58%c.
Oats showed considerable independence of
other grains though the heavy liquidation had
some influence. December closed easy, %@%c
lower, at 37%@38c.
Provisions were dull and ruled easier. Jan
uary pork closed^ 5c down, lard 2%'goc lower

RATHBUN TELLS
STRANGE STORY
Admits That He Planned
to Defraud Insurance
Company.
Prisoner Denies That He Is
Responsible for Good
* man's Death.
â¢ -
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 12.â Newell C.
Rathbun, who, according to the police,
has confessed that he planned to defraud
an insurance company out of $4000 by pre
tending that a corpse shipped to Little
Rock was his own dead body, to-day ad
mitted, according to the authorities, that
the man who accompanied him to the
hotel in Jeffersonville, lnd., and was
found dead the next day was Charles
Goodman, v.ho is said to have come from
Evansville, lnd.
Colonel John D. Rodman, United States
recruiting officer here, notified Chief Sul
livan to-day that no requisition will be
necessary tor the return of Rathbun to
Jeffersonville, lnd. He says Rathbun is
now a Federal prisoner, charged with de
Â¦ertlon, and will, as soon as he can com
municate with Washington, have the pris
oner turned over.
The Jeffersonville authorities will make
a claim for the custody of Rathbun on
a charge of murder. Rathbun *aid to
Chief of Detectives Sullivan:
"1 admit everything except that I killed
Goodman. I meant to kill him and kept
him drunk for that purpose, but he died
of alcoholism and 1 was not forced to
make way with him. My story about an
accomplice named Blanchard was ficti
tious. 1 acted alone and without a con
federate."
Goodman Was of a Roving Nature.
It is said that Goodman, who was of a
roving nature, came to this city October
19 and took up quarters with the Salva
tion Army. He repeatedly told the clerk
that he did not have any money and did
not know how he would get out of the
eit;-.
The clerk, J. C. Pelton, says that about
last Wednesday Goodman entered the
hotel and remarked he had met "an easy
mark' who had given him a quarter. "I
have got an engagement with him at 8
o'clock to-night and he is going to show
me how to make some money," continued
Goodman.
Shortly before 8 o'clock, Pelton says, he
saw Goodman meet a man answering the
description of Rathbun in front of the
hotel. Detective Donohue followed the
clew and found that two men who
answer the description of Rathbun and
Goodman appeared in the Falls City
Hotel in Jeffersonville about 8 o'clock.
Rathbun registered for both and they
were assigned to different rooms.
In about half an hour they reappeared
in the office and the clerk says that the
man whom Rathbun had said was Ten
eyke had on a different coat and vest than
when he went to the room. He had also
added a collar to his attire. The two left
the hotel, saying they would return.
More Evidence Against the Prisoner.
According to Pelton's story Goodman
returned to the Salvation Army Hotel
shortly after 9 o'clock with a new coat
and vest en and also a collar and neck
tie. Pelton says he joked him about the
change in his appearance and Goodman
said he had got the clothes from an "easy
mark" he had met in the morning. Good
man told Pelton to check him off. as he
was going to spend the night in Indiana
with his friend. Goodman went in a short
time and has not been seen at the hotel
since.
The Jeffersonville Coroner to-day iden
tified a pair of trousers found in Rath
bun's grip as being of a suit the coat and
vest of which were on the corpse found
at the Falls City Hotel.
The Louisville detectives to-day received
telegrams from the Chief of Police at
Little Rock giving an exhaustive descrip
tion of the eorose forwarded from Jef
fersonville a? that of Rathfcun. In almost
every particular the description tallies
with that of Goodman.

DEPARTMENT COMMANDER
ORDERED TO WASHINGTON
Humors Current in Military Circles of
Wholesale Desertions From
Twenty-Eighth Infantry.
The Secretary of War has appointed
General Young as a member of the board
which is to convene in Washington on
November 25 for the purpose of making
recommendations for enlarging some or'
the army posts in this country, aoandon
ing others and selecting new sites for new
ones. It is felt by the military authori
ties that many changes of this nature are
necessary since the army has been so
greatly increased. General Young will
leave the department on Sunday and will
be absent for several weeks. *
Captain E. T. Cole of the Sixth Infan
try has arrived in the city and will be
placed on duty at the discharge and de
tention camrs on Angel Island.
There is a strong rumor current in mili
tary circles that desertions are wholesale
from the Twenty-eighth Infantry, whicn
has recently been ordered to the Philip
pities. The organization is made up for
the most part of men who have seen for
eign service, and those who have been in
the Far East are not anxious to return.
Casuals and regulars are being hurried
into the Presidio, and it is expected that
the necessary 850 men will be on hand to
sail on the Grant next Friday.
What Some Candidates Spent.
Some of the candidates at the last elec
tion filed ir< mized statements of receipts
and expenditures of moneys during their
canvass with Registrar Walsh yesterday.
E. J. Smith. Tax Collector-elect, says he
spent 1365, of which $240 was contributed
to the campaign committee of the Re
publican party. Treasurer-elect McDou
gald expended $343 50. he says. John F.
Ahearn, Republican candidate for Super
visor, states that he spent $120 of "hl-j
<'wn monpy," of which $72 went to the
campaign committee.
Experts Still Disagree.
Carl Eisenschimmel and Theodore
Kytka gave more expert testimony con
cerning the signature to a deed purport
ing to be that of Mrs. Caroline Flock
hart in Judge Troutt's courtroom yester
day. The opinions of the experts as to
the genuineness of the signature are at
variance, and they each offer many Illus
trations In support of their claims. The
validity of the deed will not be decided
for several days.

MEXICAN VIEWS
ON ARBITRATION
Pan-American Delegates
File an Interesting
Report.
Say Their Plan Is J^st Fav
orable to the interests
of Peace.
CITY OF MEXICO, Nov. 12.â 1n the
preamble of their report the delegates
to the Pan-American Congress review
the question of arbitration. A notable
passage deals with the making oi arbi
tration obligatory. The report says those
who aim at such an end forget the
teachings of history and are only legis
lating ior ideal societies organized in a
superior and i Ifferent manner to those
now existing. They are not legislating
for the present day's societies in whicn
man, while moving under high aspira
tions, is at times carried away by pas
sions which disturb and blind him. The
Mexican delegation looks for more prac
tical results. They say their plan offers
something more tavorable to the inter
ests of peace than those ideas offered by
promoters of plans for the formation of
the United States of Europe, and even
of the world. â¢
El lmpitrcial says the Mexican delega
tions are united in a determination to ad
vih ate the principle of suppression of
quarantine which has created so much
obstruction to commerce throughout the
world. England has shown the way and
her public health has not suffered by
ber removal of quarantines.
The delegates to the Pan-American
conference this morning visited the Mint
and were shown through it by Finance
Minister Limantour. A banquet wus
served in the corridors.
BODIES OF DROWNED
MEN FOUND IN BAY
One Is Taken From the Water Near
Alcatraz Island and the Other
Near Hunters Point.
The body of an unknown man, unrec
ognizable because of decomposition, wai
found in the bay yesterday afternoon on
the north side ot Alcatraz Island by Mich
ael O'Donnell of the Sixth-third Company
of United States Coast Artillery. When tho
clothing was searched at the Morgue a
letter was found dated July 27, 1901, ad
dressed "Mr. E. Smith." The circular
was on the letter head of S. N. Wood <x
Co., and was in relation to a sample ot
cloth that the firm had sent to Smith.
Inquiry at the clothing company re
vealed the fact that a letter of that dat?
had been sent to Edward S. Smith at
Pleasanton, Cal. The body found in the
bay yesterday is believed to be that ot
Edward S. Smith left Pleasanton, where
he had been employed by Philip Kolb,
last August. He was from Sacramento,
and is said to have been prominent in
politics in that city at one time.
The body of a drowned man was picked
up in the bay near Hunters Point by the
tug Frolic yesterday and sent to the
Morgue. ThÂ» body was identified last
night by Mrs. James Colton as that of
her husband, a marine fireman, who had
been missing since November 5.
Damrosch on "Tristan and Isolde."
The last of the Damrosch lecture reci
tals/ that on "Tristan and Isolde." was
! given yesterday afternoon at the Califor
> nia Theater before the largest house that
! has greeted any of the series. Mr. Dam
| rosch ranks "Tristan and Isolde" with
the great love poems .of the world, "Ro
1 meo and Juliet," "Lancelot and Guine
! vere." In picturesque and vivid phrase
' the lecturer told the ancient legend, with
its marvelous weaving into music by the
master hand of Wagner. Each theme by
i* which the great music-dramatist ex
! pressed in melody the characteristics of
j the brave knight, Tristan, the beautiiul
Isolde and their piteous fate was brought
I clearly to the comprehension of the most
I indifferent listener. The lecture, as are
i all Mr. Damrosch's illustrations of the
i Wagner opera, was invaluable as an aid
j to the understanding of the inner shades
! of meaning of both music and story, and
i those present yesterday feel themselves
amply able now to undertake intelligently
the pleasant task of listening to "Tristan
I and Isolde" when its turn comes along at
j the Grand Opera-house.
The Grand Chief Visits.
An official visit was paid last evening
to Diana Circle of the Companions of the
Forest of America in Pythian Castle by
Grand Chief Companion Miss Alice Ticou
let, accompanied by Grand Sub-chief Mrs.
H. Warms, Mrs. R. Kemp Van Ec, grand
treasurer, and Mrs. Rappin, grand trus
tee. The visitors were cordially wel
comed in the circle room, prhich had been
tastefully decorated with bunting of va
rious colors and flowers and ferns. After
the routine of business there was an offi
cial inquiry by the graTid chief for the
purpose of ascertaining how proficient the
officers were in the written and unwritten
work, and there followed an address of
instruction, advice and information as to
the condition of the order. This officer
was followed by others who had some
thing to say for the good of the order,
after which a collation was served.
Tollman Will Lecture for Women.
The California Club and its women
friends will have an opportunity Friday
afternoon to hear Dr. William H. Toll
man speak on "Studies In the Factories
and Workshops of the World." Dr. Toll
man is director of the ipdustrial depart
ment of the League for Social Service of
New York, and the lecture will be both
interesting ami instructive, with numer
ous stereopticon illustrations. The lec
ture will be given in the auditorium of
the Young Men's Christian Association,
and will be under the auspices of
the civic department of the California
<"luh. Invitation cards of admission
are obtainable from members of the cluo.
Left His Fingers on the Engine.
Richard Fernanda, a machinist, had tho
fingers of his rie;ht hand amputated by
the piston of the engine at the Meat
Packing (Company's house on Fifth and
Shipley streets yesterday. Fernandez was
leaning against a partition alongside of
the ci (fine when he stooped over and per
mittPd his hand to be caught by tbe
piston, with th<* result that the four fin
gers of the rif?ht hand were completely
amputated and dropped into the piston
bed. He was taken to the Emer
gency Hospital, where Dr. Armipie.-vl
dre^se'l tho wounds and removed suf
ficient of the broken bones to form a flap
over the injured joints.
Oppose Pesthouse Site.
A largo number of property owners an'l
residents in the vicinity of the Bay View
Farm appeared betore the Supervisors'
Health and Hospital Committee yester
day to protest against the purchase by
the city of the property ; is a site for the
new pesthouse. Richard Welch, appeal
ing for the protestants, argued that thÂ«
establishment of the pesthouse in the lo
cality named would depreciate the sur
rounding property in South San Fran
cisco and drive small holders from their
possessions. The committee postpone!
recommendation and will be assisted by
the protestants in securing the oft ?r oi
another site for the purpose. Should one
be found as advantageously located a3
Bay View Farm it will be recommended
for purchase.
Official Recount.
The official recount of the returns of
the last municipal election is now pro
gressing before the Election Commission
In the assembly-room of the Board of
Education. Three districts have already
been countedâ :he Twenty-eighth, Twen
ty-ninth and Thirtieth, but no apprecia
ble changes in the votes have been dis
covered. Yesterday it was thought that
Byington had lost twenty votes in tho
Fourth Precinct of the Thirtieth District.
In that precinct Fisk was credited on the
official returns with 52 and Byington with
71, but the recount gave Byington only
51. Comparison with the semi-official re
turn?, however, showed that Byington
was credited with 51. so no change result
ed. The count will be resumed to-day.
POINT RICHMOND
AS A TERMINUS
One Report That Goulds
Will Extend Line to
That Point.
It Seems More Probable, How
ever, That Morgan Seeks
Steamship Connection.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 12.â 1t is reported
here that the Gould system will extend
one of his lines into Point Richmond, Cal.,
the Santa Fe terminus.
A financier who professes to know the
intentions of J. P. Morgan declared he
had positive knowledge and had been
aware for several months that Morgan
is planning a trans-Pacific steamship
route with one terminus at San Francis
co, the other at Hongkong. The Call's
informant further stated that steam
ship connections would be made with the
Siberian Railroad, which is now practical
ly completed and will soon be in opera
tion. Morgan, it is well known by par
ties near to him, has purchased the Ley
land line of steamers plying between
New York and Liverpool, and nego
tiations are pending for the purchase of
the Atlantic transport line also. Whether
or not he will divert some of the pur
chased Atlantic liners for the Pacific
Coast line is not known, but it is said
that he lately conferred with the Cramps
of Philadelphia, and it is surmised that
he contemplates the building of new
steamers.
Morgan seems to have gone into the
steamship business on a big scale: in
fact it is said his operations will assume
the proportions of a steamship trust. He
has attempted to buy the White Star
line and the Hamburg- American line. Sev
eral months ago it was reported the Ham
burg-American Company would estab'ish
a line of steamers in the Pacific, and it
is now known that Morgan was at that
time negotiating with them.
It is reported, also, that during a con
versation recently with a Washington of
ficial Morgan alluded to the attempt of
Germany to acquire South American
coaling stations for the Hamburg-Amer
ican line, which is subsidized by the Ger
man Government, and remarked that
if the Hamburg-American line should be
sold to an American syndicate Germany's
controversy with this Government over
our assertion of the Monroe doctrine be
cause of these coaling stations would be
avoided.
Morgan's purchase of land at Point
Richmond, Cal., is not understood per
fectly here, but it is surmised that he
has in view some kind of a traffic ar
rangement with the Santa Fe Railroad,
which has its terminus there. It is be
lieved to ber Mr. Morgan's ambition to
control a transportation route from Lon
don to the Orient, and the Santa Fe is
expected to become one of the links in
this chain.
PRISON GUARDS
FIERI CONVICTS
Fugitive Prisoners Sur
render After Lively
Fusillade.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 12.â Three
more of the twenty-six fugitive convicts
from Fort Leavenworth Prison were cap
tured at Bazar, near Cottonwood Falls,
Kans., late this afternoon by penitentiary
guards after a fight in which one of the
convicts was shot. The captured men are
Gilbert Mullen, white; Fred Robinson,
mulatto, and Sol Southerland, Indian.
Southerland was wounded to-day, but not
seriously. He was also shot while mak
ing his escape from the prison last week.
None of the guards were injured to-day.
Only nine of the escaped convicts are yet
to be taken, and the whole country is on
the lookout.
Two men supposed to be convicts stole
a horse and buggy from a man near
Atchison and robbed him of what money
he had, but finally abandoned the vehicle
after being pursued some distance.
Lewis was returned to the penitentiary
in irons to-day and is in the hospital in
a critical condition from his wounds.
Thompson, when brought in, was found
to be only slightly wounded.
Work on the new cellhouse, stopped at
the time of the outbreak, was resumed
to-day. Oberlin M. Carter, ex-captain of
engineers, serving a five years' sentence,
was busy drawing plans for some of the
new buildings.
GERMAN EMBASSADOR

BERLIN. Nov. 12.â Emperor William
has acceded to the oft repeated request
of Count Paul yon Hatzfeldt-Wildenburg,
the German Embassador to Great Brit
ain, that he be allowed to retire from the
diplomatic service on the ground of ill

PENSION PLAN
FINDING FAVOR
Southern Pacific May
Aid Project of Its
Employes.
Committee Is Much Pleased
by the Progress That
Has Been Made.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 12.â Employes of
the Southern Pacific Company say that
the prospects for the voluntary pension
department of the Southern Pacific Com
pany are more hopeful than in the past.
A. J. Gardiner of the Southern Pacific
pipe department in Sacramento, has re
turned from a trip to San Francisco,
where he has been in conference with H.
L. Sanborn and other members of the
committee of employes interested in the j
proposed voluntary benefit and pension I
department for employes of the Southern [
Pacific Company. Mr. Gardiner says that
the conference of the committee was held
to consider minor changes in the proposed
regulations which seem to the committee
to be desirable, relating principally to the
scale of contributions and benefits.
It appears that former President
Charles M. Hays of the Southern Pacific i
Company, in acknowledging the receipt I
of the petition of the employes, took oc- i
casion to say that the subject was one [
of great interest to him, and that such !
a project, with rules and conditions fair
to the company and to the employes,
would have his sympathy and support.
This statement of Mr. Hays the commit
tee construed to be only a fair expression
of what might be taken as the views or
opinion of the management on the sub
ject and the committee therefore feels
much encouraged in the work it has un
dertaken.
Mr. Gardiner draws attention to the
fact that the United Traction and Elec
tric Company of Providence, R. 1., has
recently inaugurated a benefit and pen
sion system on much the same lines as
that asked for by a large number of the
employes of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. It appears that many of the rules
and regulations and features adopted by
the United Traction and Electric Com
pany have been copied almost verbatim
from those formulated by the employes
of the Southern Pacific Company.
The committee realizes that it is work
ing on a big proposition and has big men
to deal with. Hence its desires to have
the proposition in as nearly perfect form
as possible for consideration by the board
of directors of the company. Owing to
the very unsettled conditions which have
prevailed regarding the management of
the Southern Pacific Company, the com
pany deemed it wise to "make haste
slowly," realizing that a settled condition
of affairs is essential to insure a proper
consideration of the subject.
In the meantime the committee, under
the leadership of Mr. Sanborn, has been
engaged in gathering statistics from
every available source, with the result
that certain modifications appear to be
absolutely necessary to insure the stabil
ity of the proposed plan.
A pension department was recently es
tablished on the Illinois Central Railroad,
which is one of the lines controlled by
the Harriman syndicate, to which depart
ment the Illinois Central has contributed
$75,000 annually. This tact, Mr. Gardiner
says, has encouraged the committee to
ask for a similar sum from the Southern
Pacific Company for the pension feature
Â«f the proposed new organization. This
does not include the contribution of $6000
each to the death and disability feature.
The employe may select either the
death, disability or pension feature, or
all of them. Everything is purely volun
tary and then men are at liberty to be
come members or not, just as they may
choose. It is a purely democratic, volun
tary association of the employes, in akl
of which it is asked that the company
contribute.
Mr. Gardiner says the committee is anx
i ious for the completion and adoption of
I the plan and sanguine of its success.
LIVES ON BOITNDAIIY
LINE TO ESCAPE ARREST
Murderer Easily Dodges American
and Mexican Officers Who
Seek Him.
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 12.â Pedro Morales,
the border ruffian, who is wanted in En
senada for the murder of a Justice of the
Peace and for numerous other crimes,
and in Los Angeles for the murder of
Deputy Sheriff Wilson of San Gabriel, is
said to be living within fourteen miles
or this city, almost on the border line be
tween Mexico and the ' nited States. He
shows an utter disregard for the law and
for the officers who r ihi enforce it,
but who cannot or will v work together
for his capture. He has nty of friends
of the same class as himself, Â¦ and they
keep watch sufficiently close to enable
him to dodge from one side of the bound
ary to the other in order to escape any
officers who may be planning to capture
him.
Word has been sent to Los Angeles as
to his whereabouts, but there seems to be
an unwillingness on the part of some to
tackle the outlaw. Furthermore, the of
ficers en the other side of the line cannot,
according to reports, be induced to co
operate with the American officers. It ia
useless for the local Constables to go af
ter him. as he can get across the line,
and there will be no one there to drive
him back.
FORGES THE SIGNATURE
OF A SAN FRANCISCAN
Charge Preferred in San Jose Against
a Remittance Man From
Colusa.
SAN JOSE. Nov. 12.â James Lull, a well
known habitue of the resorts of the city,
is a prisoner in the City Jail to-night,
charged with forgery and the passing of
a number of worthless checks. Lull, who
is about 45 years of age, has lived here
eight years. His father was a wealthy
Colusa farmer. At the latter's death the
sons share of the estate was left in trust,
because of his dissipated habits. E. M.
Patterson of 1606 California street, San
Francisco, was made guardian of the
estate and each month Lull received a
remittance of $30 from him. Lately this
remittance has not been sufficient to meet
the pace Lull set and he is alleged to
have been forging Patterson's name to
checks.
Storms on Alaskan Coast.
PORT TOWNSEND. Nov. 12.â The coast
of Southeastern Alaska continues to be
swept by storms, according to reports
brought by the steamer Al-Ki, arriving
to-night from ' Skaguay. The Al-Ki, In
attempting to cross Queen Charlotte
Sound was forced to turn back, owing
to the fury of the gale and high seas.
Her decks' were swept with immense
waves and Pilot Bradley, who has been
continually on the Alaska route during
the past thirteen years, says that the
st'-rm was the most furious he has wit
nessed during that period.
Municipal Elections in Naples.
ROME, Nov. 12.â Municipal elections
were held to-day In Naples, where the
municipality had been suppressed for two
years owing to wholesale corruption by
the Camorra party and where the city
administration had been conducted by
the government. The result was the de
feat of the Camorra candidates by a
small majority. The press (Jongratulates
Naples upon the defeat of the Camorra
delegates by honest candidates, compar
ing it with the defeat of Tammany Hall
by the friends of good government in
New York.

PUEBLO, Colo., Nov. 12.â John "White,

Traction Company, was electrocuted at
the corner of Michigan and Abriendo ave

a dying condition strapped to a tramway
pole, and died shortly after being taken
down. He had evidently come in contact
with a live wire and was unable to de
scend from his position.

ACADEMY NEEDS
TO BE REBUILT
Board of Visitors Report
Against West Point
Patchwork.
Recommend Better Accom
modations and Pay for
Future Army Officers.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12.â The most im
portant feature of the report of the board
of visitors to the West Point Military
Academy is a recommendation that the
academy be rebuilt. The report says:
It has been nearly one hundred years since
"West Point was founded, and from the birth
of the institution nearly all the improve
ments have been on the patchwork plan. There
is but one building constructed by the Govern
ment at the post that is In harmony with thla
day and generation. All the others are old.
uncomfortable and entirely inadequate to meet
present conditions. Few of them are equipped
with any of the conveniences to be found in the
average public building in the country districts
In many of the States. It can be truthfully
said that there la a pressing necessity for a
complete tearing down and a new building up.
The policy pursued in that regard at Annapolis
should be speedily adopted at West Point.
Nothing can be gained by postponement. In
deed, it seems to the board that almost every
dollar spent in the future for "enlarging
here and altering and patching there" is so
much money thrown away. The enlarged duties
and responsibilities of the military as related
to the recently enlarged sphere of American
interests and power are such as not only to
justify but force Congress to proper recogni
tion of the demands of the military academy.
Putting the matter In a few words It can be
truthfully said that the barracks in which the
cadets sleep and study and live when not in
recitation room or on the drill grounds are lit
tle better equipped than the barracks at the
average country poorhouse. In many of the
rooms the cadets are crowded. The ventilation
of these rooms is in accordance with hygienic
notions of a century ago and is simply exe
crable.
Features of the present arrangement
which are specially condemned are the
electric light and gas plants; no water or
sanitary arrangements in the barracks
and no bathrooms; the lack of church
facilities and the hotel, which is de
scribed as "a mere hut." The water sup
ply also is threatened and a water famine
is imminent nearly every summer.
The report says the board is satisfied
that hazing has been eradicated. Full
credit is given to Colonel Mills for this.
The report also says that the sturdy sup
port given Colonel Mills by the Secretary
of War has done much to establish and
secure discipline upon a sound basis.
The report refers to athletics and says
that cadet members of the baseball and
football teams compare favorably with
others who do not participate in these
games. It is recommended that the acad
emy be provided with a modern sea coast
battery and a modern mountain battery
for the Instruction of the cadets.
The board recommends that the pay of
the cadets, which is now $540 a year each,
be increased $69 a year, to be equal to
that of naval ca#ets.
ILEPORTS FROM PANAMA
GREATLY EXAGGERATED
Eebels Are Extremely Careful and
Have Not Molested Property
of Americans.
NEW YORK, Nov. 12.â Passengers ar
riving to-night on the steamship Orizaba
confirm the news that the city of Pan
ama has not been taken by the rebels.
Among those who arrived was St. C.
Hunt, agent of the Panama Railroad and
Steamship line at Panama. Hunt said
that things were quiet when he left Qkftt
city, November 6.
"The reports as to the danger of the
city falling have been very much exag
gerated." he said. "The lowa was at
Panama when we left and the Machia.s
at Colon with sufficient force to protect
the foreign interests. The rebels have
been careful and have .not molested
American property. General Alban will
hold out, for he has 1500 troops well
armed and equipped. They have plenty
of guns and could get along without the
two big ones shipped from this port last
week. Traveling is comparatively safe,
as all trains carry one troop car. These
cars carry the soldiers of the Colombian
Government. The, rebels have appeared
at Culebra and Empire, small towns near
by, but they have not molested the inhab
itants. They have received some food
and clothes 'from their friends, but have
not done any damage."
GENERAL MERRIAM GOES
ON THE RETIRED LIST
3rigadier General Bates Will Tempo
rarily Command the Department
of Colorado.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12.â Brigadier
General Henry C. Merriam will be placed
on the retired list to-mcrrow on ac
count of age. Hi 3 present command, the
Department of Colorado, will be as
sumed temporarily by Brigadier General
J. C. Bates, commanding the Department
of the Missouri. It is expected that
Major General Mac Arthur, about the Ist
of January, will be assigned to the com
mand of the Colorado. He has expressed
a preference for that assignment, and
t.ie orders will be issued when he is re
lieved from his present duties in this
city as a member of the board of bre
vets. Next to General Wade General
Merriam is the ranking brigadier general
in the army. He served throughout the
War of the Rebellion in the volunteers,

rNGLISH AUTHORITIES.
USE OLD POSTAL ROUTE
LONDON, Nov. 12.â Inquiries at the
PostofÃce Department to-day show tbat
no change has been made in the matter
of sending the Australian mails by way of
the Pacific Ocean and across the United
States by rail from San Francisco to New
York, thence by steamship to Liverpool.
The authorities say that the San Fran
cisco route will ordinarily be used for the
New Zealand mails, but the Suez route Is
quicker for the Australian service. No
change Is likely to be made until much
quicker boats are put on and more fre
quent service given between tho United
States and Australasia.
Narrowly Escapes Death by Fire.
CLEVELAND. Ohio. Nov. 12.â A hre
which destroyed M. O. Stone & Co.'s
building at 46 and 48 Euclid avenue this
afternoon was attended by the thrilling
rescue of over a score of women and girls
who were employed on the fourth floor in
Mrs. Graham's corset factory. When the
fire broke out all the girls made a rush
for the fire escape and ladders. The fire
spread so rapidly, however, that they
could not use the fire escapes and it
seemed that many of them must perish.
Ladders were quickly sent up, however,
and all but three of the women were taken
from the windows and carried to safety
by firemen. Three, who could not be
reached, including Mrs. Graham, jumped
from the fifth story windows into nets
held by the firemen below. Not one of
them was seriously injured.

PROMISES NOT
TO INTERFERE
Bulgaria Complies With
the Demand of Con
sul Dickinson.
Plan to Send Troops After the
Captors of Miss Stone
Is Checked,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, Jf,
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 12.â Secretary
Hay received to-day from Consul General
Dickinson confirmation of the report that
he had notified Bulgaria she would be held
responsible for the abduction of Misa
Stone. Dickinson has forced the hand oC
the administration, which had not pro-*
posed to take any action looking to rep
aration until after the liberation of \iisa
Stone. It was explained, however, that
Dickinson was compelled to give notifica
tion because of the information he had
received showing that the Bulgarian Gov
ernment contemplated sending troopa ta
destroy the brigands holding the Ameri-*
can missionary.
Solicitor of State Penfleld ha 3 been look*
ing into the law feature of the case anoj
his memorandum will support Secretary
Hay in his determination to secure full
and adequate reparation.
No representations looking to an indem*
nity will be made until Miss atone ha*
been released.
SOFIA, Nov. 12.â Consul General Dick-Â«
inson supplemented his verbal represent
tatlons to the Bulgarian Government by
a note to-day. in which he recapitulates
the history of the abduction of Misa Ellen
M. Stone and her companion, ilme,
Tsilka, and the steps taken to obtain theist
release and reminds the Foreign Minister
of his promise to give every assistance.
He also instances where the attitude ot
subordinate officials has not conformed
with this assurance. Finally Dlckinaor*
repeats his demand for the noninterfer-*
ence of tha Government.
The Government's reply, according t<Â»
the opinion expressed in official circles,
was that the Government hesitated to
establish the giving of protection to brig
ands in treating for the ransom of cap-*
tives, but in the present case, involving
the safety of two ladies, the Government*
as an act of courtesy and humanity, will
comply with Dickinson's request.

SEEK TO AMEND
CITY CHARTER
Commissioners of Works
Would Change Twen
ty Sections.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
completed a list of the various sections of
the charter which it has deemed advis
able to recommend for amendment in or
der to facilitate the administration of its
affairs.
John B. Gartland. the board's attorney,
has made a close investigation of the pro
visions regulating the Department of
Works and he finds that no less than
twenty sections should be modified or
altered in order that the city's business
should not suffer as it has done in the
past. As soon as his findings have been
typewritten they will be forwarded to the
Committee on Charter Amendments of the
Board of Supervisors to be submitted to
the people should the board so decide.
The recommendation? include a change
in the mode of procedure so as to expe
dite street work. The most important
amendment, however, and one which will
be hailed with joy by contractors, will be
the provision for progress payments on
public contracts &s on Federal and State
work. Section 21 will have the following
Â¦words added to its terms:
Vnless in the ordinance authorizing or order
ing said work provision if mado therein for
progressive payments for the same.
Section It; will be so amended as to give
the Board of Works power to compel the
repair of dangerous sidewalks or portions
thereof by making protests of no avail
The section will be enlarged by the fol
lowing:
Or if said portion of said sidewalk is so out
of repair ai? aforesaid, a notice In writing shal!
be delivered to the owners or their agents
personally to repair forthwith said portion of
said street, avenue, lane, alley, court or place
to the center line thereof, or "said portion of
said sidewalk in front of the property of which
he is the owner or tenant or occupant.
Section 5 will be amended so as to re
lievo the board from any obligations for
accidents resulting from existing defects
in street work which may have been done
under former boards or officials. The
foregoing are some of the most important
changes to be recommended.
REHEARING OF THE OIL

The matter of the rehearing of the oil
rate case granted to the Southern Pacific

RILEY POINTED
OUT AS SLAYER
Ekberg Murder Mystery
Is Apparently
Solved.
Detectives Claim Evidence
Is Strong Enough to
Convict.
John Thomas Riley, one of the suspects
arrested Monday by Detectives Tom Gib
son and Archie Hammil, will be charged
with the brutal murder of Otto Ekberg.
Mrs. Alma Miller, who, so far as the po
lice know, is the only witness to the
crime, identifies the prisoner from gen
eral appearances, and the detectives have
evidence which they claim is sufficient to
convict him of the charge.
Ekberg was a non-union teamster em
ployed during the strike by W. P. Fullsr
<fc Co. When he went to work he took
the place of Riley, who in response to
the call of the union threw down his
reins and quit work. Alter peace be
tween the employers and the teamsters
was effected, Lkberg succeeded in holding
hit job, much to the distaste of Riley.
Witnesses will be produced by the police
who will swear that on several occasions
Riley expressed a threat that he would
kill Ekberg.
Ekberg came to his death in a tragic
manner last Saturday night- He had put
his team up in a Mission-street stable,
and had reached Third and Townsend
streets when he was struck from behind
by a heavy roller and killed. His assail
ant coolly turned the body of his victim
over, looked into the face, expressed a
word of satisfaction at having killed the
right man and escaped from the scene.
Mrs. Miller was the only one who wit
nessed the tragedy. She saw the blow
struck and heard the assassin speak. She
did not see the latter's face, but from
general appearances points out Riley as
the man.
The weapon with which the crime was
committed was a heavy iron roller used
in moving castings from the truck. It
belonged on the truck driven by the mur
dered man and was missing from Satur
day night until Monday morning. The
detectives got their first clew that Riley
was the murderer from the fact that he
was seen loitering about in the railroad
yards on the night the crime was com
mitted.
In a statement made last night to the
police, Riley asserted his innocence and
?aid that he was aware the detectives
had been on his trail for the past two
days. Riley is an opium fiend, as was his
supposed victim, Ekberg. Both men
smoked opium and had rooms in a house
at 512 Bush street. Riley is married and
has a mother residing at ISO Clara street.

Serious Accident Befalls Cavalryman
George H. Lewis at a Broadway
Lodging-House.
George R. IxÂ»wi<. stepson of Sergeant
Lewis of the local police force, met with
a serious if not fatal accident at 651
Broadway at an early hour yesterday
morning by falling from a rear porch a
distance of twenty-five feet and sustain
ing a fractured skull.
I*ewis was a convalescent at the Pre
sidio Hospital, and on Monday secured a
leave of absence. In company of a com
panion named Dare he visited several re
sorts during the evening and, finding they
could not reach the Presidio in time th*e
men took a room at the number given
About 1 o'clock Dare awakened and found
I^ewis missing. He instituted a search
and found Lewis lying unconscious on
the ground in the rear yard. He picked
him up and carried him to the room and
a few hours lat^r. finding it impossible
to revive his comrade, he called for an
ambulance and had him conveyed to the
Emergency Hospital, where it was found
that tht- injured man had sustained a se
vere fracture of the skull, besides several
lacerated and contused wounds.
The military authorities, on learning of
the soldier's injuries, had him transferred
to thti Presidio Hospital. The injured
trooper belongs to Troop M, Fifteenth
Regiment. He was formerly a member
of the Seventeenth Regiment, and had
held a sergeant's commission, which he
gave up when he re-enlisted last March in
tho Fifteenth. He recently returned from
Alaska with his troop, in which place he
had been for the last two years. Ser
geant Lewis, who is on his vacation in
Amador County, was informed by tele
graph. The soldier's mother was with
him in the hospital prior to his removal

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1901,
CLUB IS ORGANIZED
IN WESTERN ADDITION
Chess, Checker and Whist Experts Ally
Themselves to Win Championship of the
City of San Francisco in Tournament
THE Western Addition Chess,
Checker and Whist Club has or
ganized and has secured club
rooms, nicely furnished, on Fill
more street, between Sacramento
and Clay. The president is G. P. Wood
ward. The charter members are all busi
ness and professional men who dwell
not far from Fillmore street or on that
thoroughfare. They number nearly one
hundred.
The proposition of forming- a club has
been under consideration for some time.
The membership includes such expert
talent that it is proposed after awhile to
challenge other organizations in the city
to play checkers, chess and whist for the
championship of San Francisco. Every
evening the members are practicing and
they find their club a large addition to
the pleasure of life in the Westrn Addi
tion.
The officers in addition to the president
are: Vice president. Sidney M. Van Wyck
Jr.; recording secretary, Dr. Tobriner;
financial secretary. Franklin Pearson;
treasurer, C. W. Moores.

EXCLUSION ACT
RECEIVES NOTICE
Determined Resistance
to Extension Is
Certain.
Senator Perkins expects to leave Cali
fornia for Washington, D. C, on the 26th
inst. He received a letter from Senator
Bard yesterday in which the latter wrote
that he would probably leave for the na
tional capital on the 26th of this month
and might visit San Francisco before that
date.
Senator Perkins fancies that the Con
gressional delegation from this State will
not have smooth sailing in efforts to re
new the Chinese exclusion act. He ap
prehends determined resistance from Con
gressmen representing Eastern constitu
encies.
The allied bosses are giving out the re
port that they have considerable munici
pal patronage to throw into the next cam
paign for the gubernatorial nomination.
The story, as told by the boss followers, is
that Sheriff John Lackmann promised
thirty places in his office to Herrin and
Burns. It is also rumored that patronage
in the Auditor's office will be thrown into
the boss pool. The rumors are circulated
to cheer up the despondent push. John
Lackmann and Harry Baehr have no
places at the disposal of the bosses. The
Auditor-elect does not even entertain the
notion of passing out a gold brick. He
has only one position of importanceâ that
of Chief Deputy Auditorâ to bestow and
in the selection of a man for that place
he will consider the business requirements
of the office. The Auditor-elect is going to
the Santa Cruz Mountains to rest for a
few days and on his return will consider
the subject of chief deputy.
All of the patronage in the Sheriff's
office is practically placed. All the help
that candidates for Governor will get from
Mr. Lackmann will not influence the
course of a single delegate. The bosses,
however, will continue to hand out gold
bricks and some of the gullible may ac
cept the packages.
Cosper and Dibble are not so lonely in
retirement as they were before the elec
tion. They are consoled now by the com
pany of Fisk and Cobb and will soon have
the fellowship of Lynch. The spring elec
tion in San Jose may add to the list of the
exiles. Johnny Mackenzie will have to
put up the battle of his life to hold the
works in that town.
Tax Collector Mandamused.
Judge Seawell yesterday issued a writ
of mandate, returnable before him No
vember 15, 1901, directing Tax Collector
Scott to receive from H. W. Newbauer the
sum of $1 95, due as taxes on a lot at
Twenty-first and Diamond streets, and to
issue to Newbauer a receipt for the same.
The writ was issued and an affidavit
filed by Newbauer in which he states that
the Tax Collector refused to receive the
taxes because he. Newbauer, had failed
to pay taxes on $23,000 worth of stock in
the First National Bank, amounting to
$357 93. While the tax on the lot amount
ed to only $3 95, he says the Tax Collector
placed a lien on the land for the entire
amount. Newbauer claims that the stock
is not assessable and that Scott had no
right to hold the property for taxes on
the shares.
John Gillig's Will Filed.
The will of John Gillig, a merchant of
Virginia City, Nev., who died November
3, 1901, was tiled at the office of the Coun
ty Clerk yesterday. The document dis
poses fit an estate consisting of a ranch
in Yolo County and stocks and bonds val
ued at $25,000. By the terms of the will
the estate is divided between Rebecca
Gillig, wife of the deceased, and her son
Harry Gillig. The beneficiaries are also
named as executor and executrix.

NEWLANDS SEES
GOOD TIME NEAR
Congressman Prom Ne
vada Says State Has
Great Prospects.
Congressman Newlands of Nevada said
yesterday that there is a good chance
that the bill to reclaim the arid lands
that he introduced at the last session of
Congress will reach action at the coming
session. President Roosevelt is enthusi
astically in favor of the irrigation of me
arid States, that they may be reclaimed.
The bill that Congressman Newlands in
troduced was favorably considered by two
House committees, the Committee on
Arid Lands and the Committee on Public
Lands. It was also favorably reported
by the Senate Committee on Public
Lands. There was so much business at
the last session of congress and the time
was so short that the measure did not
reach final consideration in the two
houses.
Congressman Nowlands is an enthusi
astic believer in the great future of Ne
vada, and says that the measure that he
has fathered will be a factor in the ad
vancement of his State. It provides that
the proceeds of the sales of all public
lands, amounting to about $3,000,(Hk) an
nually, shall go into a fund to be expend
ed under the direction of the Secretary
of the Interior in providing storage reser
voirs for water in the arid States to make
the lands available for settlers. The en
tries under the act must be in eighty-acre
tracts. The cost of each enterprise is ap
portioned among all the acres capable of
reclamation by it. Settlers will pay for
the lands in ten annual installments 1. s
provides that the fund shall oe kept good
and be a revolving fund to be constantly
increased by new sales of land and in
stallment payments.
'} think." said Mr. Newlands at the
Palace Hotel yesterday, "that this plan
would insure the reclamation of all the
arid lands and the settling up of the
country in from thirty to fifty years and
the general treasury will not be taxed to
effect that."
Concerning the immediate outlook for
the advancement of Nevada Mr New
lands was very enthusiastic. He said that
In the next twenty years Nevada will de
velop proportionately with any State in
the Union. The State has been neglected
in every way until recently. The policy
of the railroad had been against Nevada
Mr. Newlands said:
"All rail transportation lines in new
countries ordinarily act as pioneers to
build up population that business may
be supplied to the railroads. Idaho
Utah, Montana and Arizona have
been built up in that way. Ne
vada would have thrived similarly if
the Central Pacific road had been tied to
the Union Pacific. But the Central Pa
cific was controlled by the Southern Pa
cific, and the last named company was
interested in building up the southern
line.
"The change in the administration of
the Central Pacific, the Central now be
ing tied to the Union Pacific, promises
much for Nevafa. The Union Pacific de
sires to increase the population of Ne
vada and it will exert its energy to the
accomplishment of that end.
"For a long time Nevada was given
over to speculative mining. In recent
years the State has been paying atten
tion to development along various lines.
Reno is growing rapidly and is fast be
coming the center of enterprise, as Salt
Lake and Denver are the centers for Utah
and Colorado. The decline of the Corn
stock gave the impression that the min
eral wealth of Nevada was exhausted.
The fact is that it has hardly been tap
ped.
"Nevada has been less protected than
any of the intermountain States.. It is
now receiving: eaual attention with the
other mining States.
"Nevada is well watered with four
streams and storage reservoirs will great
ly increase the area that is capable of
producing agricultural products. I look
for great and general development of the
resources of the State from this time on."

PILLSBURY HAS
NOYES IN HAND
Cross - Examination of
Chief Witness Is in
Progress.
Amicus Curiae Begins Sharp
Interrogatory Fire Against
the Judge.
Judge Arthur H. Noyes, who once ran
a court at Nome, is now in the hands oi
Amicus Curiae Pillsbury. The direct ex
amination has been concluded and the
cross fire has begun.
The witness starts out well in the
morning, but us the hours go by the hot
atmospnere of the courtroom and tho
constant mental concentration upon th'i
questions develop an irritability whicia
[ is plain and ou-xtanding during the latter
part of the afternoon proceedings. Under
direct examination Noyes was placable
and mild. When the cross questioning
was begun he became sarcastic in his an
swers and at times gave vent to his feel
ings in terse epigrams.
When the Crowley espionage episode
was mentioned the Judge looKed at At
torney Metson and said: "In some things
I am as brave as Metson. Oh, yes, 1 can
be even as brave as Cyclops." In refec
ring to clients and attorneys in the Nome
country the witness said: "To his attor
ney, the client is never a ciaim- jumper;
he is a relocator." As an excuse tor him
self he interpolated into his testimony:
"I was a new Judge in a new country un
der a new code." Here and there in the
testimony are interspersed bits of phil
osophy and wise rules of daily conduct.
Pillsbury's cross-examination Is minute
and particular. He is questioning the
Judge en all facts leading up to the com
mission of the contempt and all the de
tails surrounding it. Noyes was always
on his guard, weighing his answers care
fully. The amicus curiae is not halt
finished with him yet. Occasionally lapses
of memoryâ that impregnable fort for
witnessesâ are resorted to, but usually
the denial comes from the witness when
ever a material fact is in point.
On the Receiverships.
Pillsbury reached the receivership ques
tion almost at once. -
"About what time were the applications
made for the receiverships?" he asked.
"Some time in the afternoon of Mon
day, July 23," responded the witness.
"Did you recognize the name of the
plaintiff, Mr. Chipps?"
"No, sir."
"He went up with you on the Senator,
did he not?"
"Yes, sir."
Judge Noyes said he merely made
Chipps' acquaintance on the boat and
that he had no talk with any one in re
gard to receiverships.
"Did you have any idea when you ar
rived in Nome what McKenzie's business
was?" continued the cross-examiner.
"Only that he had some gold pumping
scheme," was the ready reply.
"Then you heard nothing of the suits
until Hume called upon you with the
papers?"
"No, sir."
"How many cases were there?" '
"About four or five."
"Were there complaints in all the cases
and did you ever hear of the location of
these claims before?"
"I might have heard Anvil Creek men
tioned in Minneapolis."
"You knew from the affidavits that the
mines were very productive and fixed the
bond in each case at $5000?"
"Yes."
"On what Investigation did you fix the
bond?"
"Variety of reasons; that it would be
a temporary affair, and that matters
would soon be settled."
Then the amicus curiae angled with the
witness. Up and down stream he played
with him on the insufficiency of the $o'X>o
bond for property which was producing
$15,000 a day. Following this line of ques
tions Pillfbury took up the orders issued
by Judge Noyes in regard to the personal
property connected with the Anvil
Creek mines. Noyes said he gave the iirst I
order to Judge Johnson and Mr. Metson
to allow the defendants the use of their
personal property.
"Did you ever set aside that order?"
queried Pillsbury.
"I don't think it was ever practically
carried out," was the answer.
"Was it filed later in August?"
"I don't know."
"When you appointed McKenzie re- j
ceiver did you go by the Alaska code or
by your general knowledge?"
"About half and half."
When Pillsbury secured the admission.
"I am a new Judge, in a new country and
under a new code," he put the following
question:
"Did it not occur to you to move mod
erately and apprehensively, then, in the
appointment of receiverships, and did it
not occur to you that the appointment of
a receiver was a drastic measure?"
"It did not. I thought there would be
no hardships upon the defendants," re
sponded the witness.
Noyes Shies at a Question.
"Did you ever hear of McKenzie hav
ing his teams hitched Up ready to go to
the mines as sonn as the orders were
signed."
"I did not." â¢
"Was it a surprise to you that McKen- I
zie took possession the same night after
the order was signed?"
Judge Noyes shied at the question, but
answered by saying that it was light all
the time then and night was as you made
it. Then came a review of the arguments
for the appeals in which Knight was spe
cially interested. This led up to the writs
of supersedeas.
"Do you remember talking with any
one else about the writ of supersedeas on i
September 15?" interrogated the amicus
curiae.
"Perhaps with Major Van Ors/lale and
Captain French," said Judge Noyes.
"On Sunday, the 16th?"
"With Geary, and I'm sure McKenzie
called."
"Was the effect of the writ discussed?"
"I told McKenzie I should conform
strictly to the requirements of the writ.
I never stated the writs were void. I
thought that when the writs arrived my
hands were tied in all the proceedings. I
didn't advise McKenzie concerning the
writs of supersedeas because I did not
know myself just what to do."
"When the deputy marshals arrived in !
Nome, October 15, what time did you
hear of their arrival?" continued Pills- '
bury in cross-examination.
"After the adjournment of court at
noon. In Geary's office on the same day
the writ of habeas corpus was presented
and denied," came from the witness.
"Do you regard McKenzie as a man of
honor and integrity?"
"He was so considered in the Dakotas."
"Do you still think so?"
"I do."
"Did you borrow any money from any j
one in Nome?"
"From Jake Linderbergâ about $500.
"Did you have any mining ventures In
Nome?"
"A one-third interest in a claim with
Borchsenius and Linderberg."

to Nome on the same boat was character
ized as a mere coincidence. As for Sen
ator Carter of Montana, Noyes dis
claimed all connection or acquaintance
ship with him. He admitted that when
the choice of districts came up between
the Judges of Alaska he was anxious to
go to Nome, "the place where the great
est stir was." In the cross-examination
much stress was laid upon Noyes' act 3.
which displayed an ignorance of code and
statute law.
In such manner the testimony is mov
ing. Pillsbury covered chronologically the
period of time from Noyes' arrival in
Nome till McKenzie's arrest. He is hit
ting constantly at two things â motive for
and the contempt itself. With record,
affidavit or other papers in hand he is
persistently hammering the witness. He
will continue his work at 9:30 this morn
ing.
When the session opened in the morning
Judge McLausrhlln took up his direct ex
amination, which was finished before
noon. Noyes told of Vawter's bribe offer
again, the $20,000 which Frost testified to
as offered to Judge Noyes if he would
change a receivership. Judge Noyes gave
the story directly, saying Vawter went
away with tears in his eyes and asking
never to speak of it again. The jury list
came tip once more, this time in the
shape of an affidavit with the names at
tached. Noyes denied all the charges
made against him in regard to the loose
methods of drawing juries.
Market-Street Company Sued.
Joseph Goodncige. a pattern-maker, filed
a suit against the Market-street Railway
Company yesterday for $25,075 for dam
ages which he alleges he received last
May while attempting- to board a McAl
lister-street car. He alleges in his com
plaint that his injuries were caused by
the carelessness of the gripman in start
ing the car before he had got aboard.
A suit for $10,000 damages against the

G. Mesa for injuries which he alleges
were received in a collision between cable
