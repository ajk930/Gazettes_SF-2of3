CHICAGO, Nov. 25. -Overland through
Alaska to the sea. by water to Seattle
and through the United States to Ottawa
officials of the Yukon territory are hur
rying to plead at the Canadian capital for
help to put down the reunion threatened
by members of the Oraer of the Midnight
Sun. Three of these officials arrived at
Chicago to-day and others are on the
â¢way.
That serious trouble Is imminent in the
far Northwest is candidly admitted by
three members of the Yukon Department
of Public Works, who were in consulta
tion in the Palmer Hcuse to-night with
local capitalists who have interests in
that country. The mor are D. McR. May
nard, accountant; J. A. Tache, resident
engineer, and P. F. Merrier, assistant en
gineer.
President H. S. Graves of the White
Pass and Yukon Railway Company was
among those who talked over the situa- i
tion with the Yukon officials. The While '
Pass and Yukon Bail way is owned large
ly by American capital, its main office be
ing in Chicago.
Plot Formed p. Year Ago.
A determined, united effort by a band
of at least 1500 men who have been laying
plans for nearly a year is the plot, as
described by the officials, to establish an
independent government. Seven-tenths of
the men are Americans, and they have
grievances and the ability to set them
forth in convincing style. They believe
they have power to obtain by force the
rights which they declare have been de
nied them.
Governor General Minto of Canada is
to be asked to send troops to the scene
and at least to double the mounted po
lice, Mr. Maynard, the leader of the par
ty, said: "? ;
"We exi>ect to proceed to Ottawa at
once and will have a consultation with
the high Government authorities about
conditions in the territory. This trouble
may assume an International phase, be
cause so many members of the secret
military order are Americans and we can
not try them for treason.
"We heard of the plans being laid to
overthrow our authority two months ago,
but believed it a hare-brained scheme of
some adventurers. Of course, no such
plot could succeed for more than a little
while, but the severity of the Arctic win
ter may delay the sending of strong mili
tary forces against the conspirators for
six months. The mounted police have al
ways been competent heretofore to take
care of all disorderly characters in the
Territory, but this affair is of too serious
a nature to be handled by the police.
Hidden Stores Along- Yukon.
"Arms and ammunition, we were told,
have been secreted in great quantities.
Provisions have been cached at various ;
strategic points this side of White Horse, i
which is the railway terminus, and be- j
yond. Dawson was to be the capital of
the republic. The conspirators depended i
on aid from Americans throughout Alaska
and circulated copies of grievances, with
the grand seal of the s organization, in
White Horse, Atlin, .Dawson, Skagway
and Circle City."
J. W. Gray, secretary of the Yukon
Public "Works Department, started for
"White Horse with the other officials, but
left the party at Seattle and went to Ot

OLON, Nov. 25.â General Alban
f has been slightly wounded in bat-
Wtle with revolutionists. His horse
was killed under him. The rest
of General Alban's troop arrived
in Panama yesterday badly worn out
from tramping with scarcely any food.
Seven hundred of them, commanded by
General Alban, left on the 3 o'clock train
in the afternoon for Empire to meet the
force of General Domingo Diaz and
General Lugo. The advance guards of
General Lugo's force were met at Cule
bra and a sharp fight occured at 6
o'clock. The Liberals retreated to Em
pire and thence to Matachin, where
there was a hard battle to-day.
General Alban started at noon to-day
for San Pablo, where the Liberals are
strongly intrenched. It is believed that
fighting is now in progress at San Pablo.
The losses in the fighting yesterday and
to-day have been very heavy on each
Bide.
Revolutionists Are Routed.
Colonel Shafer, superintendent of the
Panama Railroad, has received a tele
gram from General Alban, dated Mata
chin, saying that the Government troops
completely routed the revolutionists In

that the general expects to be in Colon
within twenty-four hours.
Colonel Shafer has been informed that
a battalion of marines from the United
States battleship lowa have arrived at
Matachin, which Is about half way
across the isthmus, to protect the rail
road and see that traffic on the lino is
not interrupted by either side. They were
landed at the request of United States
Consul Gudger at Panama.
Details from the lowa's marines are
now accompanying each passenger train,
and transit across the isthmus, which
was interrupted for a short time, has
been re-established.
Postpone the Bombardment.
General Ignacio Follaco, Senor de La
Rosa, who is General Diaz's secretary,
and the commanders of foreign war ves
sels In the harbor held a conference at
1 o'clock this morning on board the Brit
ish cruiser Tribune. As a result of this
conference General Diaz agreed not to
bombard the city or to land troops before
6 o'clock on Friday morning.
The Government gunboat, General Pin
zon, sailed out of the harbor at 4 o'clock
this morning. Her destination Is not
known here. Captain Foriaco of the Gen
eral Pinzon has 600 men under him on
the vessel.
There is a report that the gunboat is
short of provisions and that foreign war
vessels have joined in helping to replen
ish her food supply.
The postponement of the bombardment,
which had been expected to-day, ha 3 re
stored quiet and good order in the city
and the rush of foreigners to take refuge
on board warships has ceased.
WOUNDED LÂ£FT ON FIELD.
No Care Is Given Soldiers Who Fall
in the Battle.
COLON, Nov. 25.â Yesterday morning at
10 o'clock the schooner Clapet and a rail
road barge returned to Panama, bringing
350 men, from Chorrera, being the re
mainder of General Alban'a expedition.
Great crowds gathered at the wharf to
witness the landing of the soldiers. They
were received with bands of music, but
the music sounded mournful and the air
more like a funeral march than the Joy
ful strains of welcome to a victorious
army. General Alban looked his usual
and calm self and acted more like a man
on whose hands time hangs heavily for
want of something to do than one coping
with grave responsibilities under trying
circumstances.
At 3:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon, at
the head of several hundred men. General
Alban left Panama by train for Empire
station, where the Liberals were reported
to be in fairly strong numbers. His pur
pose was to surprise and rout them. The
train bearing these troops was held up
just before it arrived at Culebra station,
owing to the Liberals opening- flre on Al
ban's advance guard. Alban disembarked
his men from the train, which returned to
Panama. The fighting at Culebra lasted
from 4:40 until 9 p. m.
The Revs. Loveridge and Jacobs, Bap
tist and Wesleyan ministers, respective
ly, narrowly escaped being shot. Their
house in Culebra was riddled by bullets.
The Government troops advanced and
the fighting was stubborn all along the
railroad line until Empire station, a mile
and a half distant, was reached. The Lib
erals retreated slowly, Alban's men fol
lowing them until the latter eventually
reached Matachin station.
Here General Alban met and conferred
with Captain Perry of the lowa, who waa
returning from Colon on an armored
cram. It is understood that Captain Perry
will not allow the railroad to transport
troops, consequently General Alban and
his men were forced to push ahead on
foot. It is said Here that they thus
reached San Pablo, where the Liberals are
in force and that fighting is taking place
there. The Liberals are under command
of General Lugo.
Between the stations of Culebra and
Empire more than 150 killed and wounded
Vnen could be seen along the track. There
is no proper Red Cross service and the
wounded lack care.
The Liberals at Colon declare the ma
jority of the men killed on the line to
have been Conservative troops and that
the rebels are still in force along the rail
road.
Three hundred of the lowa's marines
were landed at 4:30 yesterday afternoon
at Panama to protect the property of the
railroad and to insure the continuance of
transit across the isthmus.
In Government circles there Is still en
tire confidence in General Alban and it is
believed that he is capable to cope with
the present situation.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 25.â The World haÂ«
the following from Washington: It is now
understood that there is a 3trong prob
ability that the Department of Justice
will take action against the copper trust,
the sugar trust and the new railroad
trust, under the Sherman anti-tru3t law,
as combinations In restraint of trade, bas
ing such action upon the decision of the
United States Supreme Court in the
Trans-Missouri Freight Association case.
The Department of Justice offlcial3 have
reached the conclusion that the Sherman
law is adequate, but will take no action
until after the opening of Congress.
Great pressure is being brought to bear
upon the President to induce him to mod
ify his recommendations relative to trusts.
Leading representatives of railroad and
other affected interests are trying to head
off any drastic recommendations. Sev
eral men vitally interested, including J.
J. Hill, A. B. Stickney, Thomas J. Lowery
and Clinton Morrison, already have been
here on such an errand. Colonel D. S.
Lamont came Saturday, but the President
was out of the city.
Burt Gets Little Satisfaction.
Horace M. Burt of Omaha, president of
the Union Pacific, called on President
Roosevelt to-day. He wanted to prevent
any direct reference in the President's
message to the Northern Securities Com
pany. It is said he inquired if it were
possible for the President to intimate to
Governor Van Sant of Minnesota that it
would be well to delay his crusade until
the Department of Justice had time to do
something. Mr. Burt got little satisfaction
at the White House.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 25.â Attorney
General Douglas, who returned home this
evening, made the following statement
in regard to the attempt to be made to
prevent the proposed consolidation of the
Great Northern and Northern Pacific
Railway companies, through the medium
of the Northern Securities Company o<
New Jersey:
"I shall earnestly co-operate with Gov
ernor Van Sant in fighting any consolida
tion which is in violation of law, and will
do anything in my power to encourage
further legislation of a practical nature,
either State or national, which is not cal
culated qÂ» preserve competition.
Hints at Proper Remedies.
"The organization of this New Jersey
corporation for the purchase of a control
ling interest in the stock of rival railway
companiesâ two of which cross and re
cross Minnesotaâ is a clear violation of
the spirit, although not of the letter, of
the act of 1881, the validity of which waa
sustained by the Supreme Court of tho
United States in the Pearsall case. I am
not in a position to discuss the remedies,
but am under the impression that Inter
ference by the Federal authorities, based
upon the Sherman anti-trust act and the
interstate commerce act, is likely to brinj
about good results. It may be that liti
gation instituted by the State, aeeking the
cancellation of some unused railway fran
chises, may be of slight assistance. Other
proceedings of law, which I feel it ln
opportune / to discuss, may also be ot
value."

Tell of the Killing of
Ayers.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 25.â trial of
Mrs. Lola Ida Bonine for the murder of
James Seymour Ayers at the Kenmore
Hotel last May began in real earnest to
day. The preliminary details as to the
finding of the body, the location of the
furniture,- bloodstains, etc, were all in
with the conclusion of the testimony of
J. F. Drew, the Capitol Hotel policeman,
who was on the stand when the court ad
journed last Friday. Baker, the man. who
saw Mrs. Bonine descend the fire escape;
Hopkins, who roomed over Ayers and
raised the first outcry; Miss Wollums,
Â¦who roomed under Ayerf. and MiÂ£6 Law
less and Miss --Mirias,"' 7 who roomed on
'either side of mm, testified to-day. The
two -latter were "regarded' ; as ' star wit
nesses, but they testified to no facts not
dt-veloped at th- inquest. Â¦
Mrs. Bonine throughout . the trial to
day, when witnesses described the cries,
grcans and throat gurgling of the dying
man. remained absolutely unmoved.
J. Frank Drew, the Capitol Hotel po
liceman, who was on the stand last .1 n
day when the court adjourned, was de
cailed. He swore that he had several
times seen the defendant come out of
Avers" room. The, occasion was about
a week before the tragedy. It was at
night about 9 o'clock. On cross-eramina
tion Drew testified that he had seen Mrs.
Bonine come out of. the rooms of others
in the hotel, Â¦ among them those of sev
eral, single men, and her demeanor was
in nowise different from -when he saw her
emerge from Avers' room. ..-"""
IV Saw Woman on Fire Escape.
Mr. Baker, an employe of the Fish
Commission, who resided in a building
adjoining the Kenmore, testified that on
the night of tlie tragedy he was awak
ened by the report of pistol shots. He
went to . the window and saw a small
woman descend the fire escape from out
side <St Ayers' window, two nights to the
Moor of the veranda, where she disap
peared into a window. The woman wore
no hat and as he did not hear the fall of
her footsteps he judged she was in her
stocking feet. '
Robert P. Hopkins, a clerk in the "War
Department, who lived at the Kenmore
Hotel, testified that on the night of the
tragedy he heard, three shots. He went
to his window on the fifth floor and look
ed down. He saw. something which look
ed like a skull lying on the fire escape
just outside the window which he after
. V*i.rd ascertained was the window of Ay
en' room. The shots were fired in quick
succession, about four seconds, he judged,
between the first and last.
At the conclusion of Hopkins' testimony
there was a stir in the courtroom as the
bailiff called Emma A. Lawless, who oc
cupied the room adjoining that in which
the tragedy occurred. She testified that
on the night of the tragedy about 9:30
o'clock Avers knocked at her door and
asked If she had any sugar. He told her
he was going away and wanted to make
some cocoa. She gave him the sugar.
About ten minutes later he knocked again
and asked her if she did not want a cup.
She replied that she did not care for it.
About 10 o'clock she retired.
Mrs. Bonine Inquires About Killing.
After recess Miss Mary E. Minas, a
clerk in the Census Office, who occupied the
room next to Ayers, took the stand. She
testified that on the evening of the trag
edy she met Mrs. Bonine in the hall at
10:30 and remarked that she was "up late.
â¢ "Yes, I am looking for Maurice," (Mrs.
Bonine's son), replied Mrs. Bonine.
Mrs. Bonine accompanied Miss Minas to
her room and after a few moments she
left. Miss Minas then retired. She was
awakened by three pistol shots, . followed
by cries for help, a gurgling sound and
then a fall. ' â¢
At breakfast ' time she met Hopkins,
who told her what he had heard. She
then sent the boy Dan up to call Ayers.
After, "the discovery, of the body Miss
Minas said she- blamed herself for not
having cried out. She wept in the dining
rcom and Mrs. Bonine comforted her.
Mrs. Bonine was very composed; she in
quired about all the details of what she
(Miss Minas) had heard and remarked:
"What a pity it was you "did not cry out
when you heard the groans."
Afraid of Being Suspected.
Miss Minas testified that after the in
quest on Sunday Mrs. Bonine came to her
with the pap%r containing the account of
her (Miss Minas*) testimony in her hand,
and expressed fegref that she "had told
what she. (Mrs. Bonine ; had done on the
night of the tragedy. Mrs. Bonine called
her attention to Baker' testimony about
the color of the v dress the woman on the
fire escape wore, and said her (Miss
Minas') testimony would direct suspicion
toward her.
â¢ When Miss Minas was excused Miss
Mary Wollums was called. She had the
room under that occupied by Ayers. ani
saw the shadow of a person pass hsr
window at 2 o'clock so the morning that
AyÂ«rs was killed. She was awakened by
sounds in the room above her* own. She
heard voices, pistol shots and something
falling. She got up, l'ghted the gas and
looked at her watch. She then noted tr-e
shadow upon thÂ« wall of her apartment.
The next morning Miss Wollums left and
did not return until Thursday night. She
then expressed a fear of going to her
room, whereupon Mrs. Bonine volun
teered, to go with her. Mrs. Bonine asked
her to explain to bar how the shadow
had- appeared. When Miss Wollums re
plied that she could liOt properly show
her how it was with the gas burning
Mrs. Bonine suggested that the gas be
turned out, and when Miss Wollums. re
plied that she was afraid to be in the
iark Mrs. Bonine repsied that she was
not.: Adjourned.

will not be permitted by the United
States men-of-war stationed at those
points. The United States has to this ex

pared to forcibly preserve freedom of

preher.sive advices regarding the situa- ;
tion reached the departments to-day -, from
their representatives on the ground, and
the light they supplied enabled the Presi
dent and Secretary Long to agree upon
instructions to the naval officers covering
possible developments.
Commander McCrea cabled to the Navy
Department that he had forbidden the
bombardment of Colon until non-com
batants had an opportunity to leave the
city. Consul General Gudger reported
that serious Interruption of railroad
traffic had occurred, but later advised
Secretary Hay that the government forces ]
had defeated the rebels, presumably near
Empire, an important station on the rail
road and that the railroad is i>eing oper- I
ated without obstruction. The battle near
Empire is preliminary to a movement on

In view of the exciting conditions pre

of the gunboat Marietta at Colon, j
The Marietta is a little smaller
than the Machias and carries eleven
officers and 133 menâ one officer more
and ten men less than are on the
Machias. Commander Delano, who
commands the Marietta, is senior to
Commander McCrea and will therefore
assume general command of affairs at
Colon, thougn he will, of course, frequent

MARINES ON EACH TRAIN.
Captain Perry Reports That Transit
Is Fully Restored.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.â Late advices
from Colombia, while showing the situa
tion on the isthmus to be still unsettled,
contain the information that free transit
by the railroad has been re-established.
These advices came in a dispatch received
by Secretary Long from Captain Perry of
the lowa, who had made a trip across the
isthmus from Panama to Colon, from
which place he sent a telegram, an extract
from which the Secretary made public as
follows:
"Perry reports that free transit across
the isthmus is restored and he returns to
Panama this afternoon. The captain will
leave a guard on each passenger train for
the present." Â¦
The purpose of the guard presumably is
to prevent interruption to the free passage
of trains by insurgents congregated along
the line of the road.
Mr. Herran, the charge of the. Colom
bian legation, is very well satisfied with
the tenor of the advices which have come
to hand to-day from Acting Governor Ar
jona of Panama, who reported that the
rebel army having been defeated at Cule
bra and Emperado General. Alban had
now marched on Colon. His theory is
that General Alban completely dislodged
the rebel force which had rendezvoused
at Chorrera, from which place, Mr. Her
ran believes, they retreated to Culebra
and Emperado, where they again took a
stand. Their defeat at these places,' Mr.
Herran says, leaves General Alban free
to march to Colon.
Mr. Herran believes that General Alban
now has at least 1000 well equipped and
thoroughly armed men, besides which 600
men are On board the Colombian boat
Pinzon, now at Colon. Mr. Herran asserts
that the rebels have not at the outside
more than 500 men.
The action takgn by the United States
in landing marines and protecting the line
across the isthmus is in conformity with

VIEWS OF LONDON EDITORS.
One Relieves the United States Will
Seize the Isthmus.
LONDON, Nov! 26.â A1l the morning pa
pers discuss South American affairs. The
Daily Telegraph says:
. "The United States is acting in strict
accordance with its diplomatic rights, but
it may find it extremely difficult to adhere
to its ideal programme."
The Daily News says: "All this plays
straight into the hands of the United
States, and that energetic power has not
been s'.ow to take advantage of it by
forceful acts which may at" any moment
develop into an occupation of the isth
mus."
The Morning Post, which hardly ex
pects the isthmtfs squabbles to have any
serious effect upon the relations of the
great powers, says: "Germany will not
indulge in any special risks or exertions
over xi mere point of honor in the Vene
zuelan dispute. Without expressing an
opinion or. the abstract justice of the
claim of the United States to control the
isthmus, we believe no single power is
likely to oppose it. The Monroe doctrine
te hardly likely to be contested so long a3
the European powers are divided among
themselves."
ATTITUDE OF TRIPLE ALLIANCE
Making No Concerted Demonstration
in South American Waters.
BERLIN, Nov. 25.â The Foreign Office
to-day declared the announcement to the
effect that the .nations party to the
triple alliance were making a concerts*!
demonstration in South American waters
to be false. Tlie infermant said there
had been discussion by Germany,
Austria and Italy regarding common ac
tion in this direction. He admitted .that
each country was sending warships to
South American waters, but said they
were acting entirely independently of one
another and were merely protecting the
property rights arid jives of their sub
jects.
It was further explained that Wash
ington was fully informed concerning the
intentions of Germany in this regard. Tho
movements of German vessels in South
American waters have been fully report
ed, as well as the vessels destined to gj
thither. No other ships have been sent to
South America.
German officials in Berlin are of the
opinion that the presence in the Carib
bean Sea of warships of the powers com
posing the triple alliance will have tha
desired effect, without making necessary
a recourse to action.
GERMAN EMPEROR ORDERS
DISMISSAL OF A COLONEL
Baron Reisswitz Summarily Dis
charged From Army for Falling
â¢ to Prevent a Duel.
Â¦ BERLIN, Nov. 25. â German newspapers
assert that Baron yon Reisswitz has been
summarily dismissed from the army by
order of Emperor William. Baron Reiss
witz was colonel of the regiment in .which
Lieutenant Blaskowitz, who was recently
killed in a duel with a brother officer, had
served. The action was taken because
the Baron did nothing to prevent the duel
in which Blaskowitz was killed.

CHEAT COMBINE
OF LUMBERMEN
Pacific Coast Merchants
Plan Vigorous Cam
paign.
Cargoes to Ba Sent Around
the Horn to Avoid
High Rates.
SEATTLE, Nov. 25.â A combination to
contror the output of lumber on the Pa
cific Coast and to wage a vigorous cam
paign In ' the markets of the Eastern
States is being formed by the millmen
and dealers, having for its nucleus the
present organization known as the Pacific
I Qoast Lumber. .Manufacturers' Associa-
J tk>n. The new combine purposes to regu
j la.te the production of the mills of Wash
| ington, Oregon and Northern California
| and to purchase and operate an immense
| fleet ef sailing vessels,- which will carry
â¢the coast lumber to Atlantic ports, from
which it will be shipped to the interior of
the Eastern States, reaching markets
! from which it is now prohibited by the
high rates of the transcontinental rail
roads.
High Railroad Rates. -
The first news of the proposed combine
'came from a renresentative of a Minne
Â¦ sota syndicate now in this city, who has
been looking ipto the situation in the
I Northwest with a view to locating sev
i eral large milling plants. This man has
been already discouraged by the fact that
the mills now in existence produce more
than a supply for coast and export de
mands ana the further fact that exorbl
i tant rates practically preclude the shlp
! ment of lumber east ot Omaha.
I Secretary Victor H. Breckman of the
I present lumbermen's organization, while
â¢ saying that the announcement of the for
mation of the combine is premature, de
clares that the situation demands the de
velopment of just such a plan. Except
for the phenomenal demana for building
purposes in the coast cities during the
I past year, Breckman says many of the
I northwestern mills would have been
forced out of business. The railroads
have made it impossible to market any
of the product in the East, and the coast
demana cannot be safely relied on for any
length of time. With a fleet of sailing
vessels Breckman says the coast lumber
can be landed In New York, Philadelphia,
Boston and other Atlantic ports for les3
than it costs to put it into Omaha at
present.
Lumbermen All in Line.
While Breckman gives no details of the
j proposed combine, it is understood that
the deal will be entered into by all the
| big lumber interests of the coast and
j many of the smaller concerns. In this
I State alone nearly 300 mills are already
! identified with the association. The pres
] ent organization was formed within the
I past year, being the outgrowth of the
Puget Sound Lumbermen's Association.
The significance of the new name, the
Pacific Coast Lumber Manufacturers' As
sociation, as indicating a broader scope
for the organization, was commented on
at the time. It now appears that all the
larger dealers and millmen of the coast
were then in touch with the movement
and. are now giving support to the larger
scheme. *
It is said that the combine will not take
the form of a trust under a central con
j trol, but will develop through some com
j mon medium the community of interests
idea, as opposed to the railroads.
MONEY IS GATHERED
FOR GREAT CENTENNIAL
Portland People Generously Aid Com
mittees in Charge of the Pro
posed--Fair.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 25.â Canvassers
for subscriptions to the Lewis and Clark
Centennial, which it is proposed to hold
in this city in 1905, started out this morn
ing and it is understood to-night that
practically the entire capital stock of the
corporation, $300,060, is assured as the re
sult of a single day's work.'
The committees which have in charge
the matter of soliciting funds have made
no report, but it is known that th
amount already subscribed and that
Â¦which foreign corporations are expected
to contribute will equal if not exceed
$300,000, the capital stock of the Lewis and
Clark corporation. The committees will
make a report Wednesday night, and
many of the large subscribers express the
belief that the amount of money pledged
at that time will greatly exceed $300,000.
REQUEST FRANCHISES
FOR ENORMOUS SYSTEM
Capitalists File Petitions in Los An
geles to Obtain Street Railway
Rights.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 25.â The Hunting
ton-Hellman electric road syndicate to
day filed petitions with the City Council
for franchises covering, if is said, greater
mileage than any franchises for street
railway ever before applied for in this
city.
Three franchises are asked for by the
Pacific Electric Company and the Los
Angeles Railway; one providing for a
belt line, covering every bit of unoccu
pied territory in Los Angeles; one for the
construction of the projected suburban i
lines, and the third franchise to allow the |
syndicate to parallel the lines of its com
petitor, the Traction Company.

HONOLULU. Nov. 19.â Edwin Sumner
Gill, editor of the Honolulu Republican,
received news by the last mail from the

work there in 1595-6, and that he had been
lert a large estate by a Mrs. Tittell. who

WITH PISTOLS
Drunken Man and Police
Officer in a Fierce
Battle.
Bullets Used Freely to Set
tle a Dispute at Santa
Rosa.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAJCTA ROSA, Nov. 25.â A battle with
bullets occurred here to-night and result
ed in the fatal wounding of Frederick
Allen and the disabling of Policeman Her
man Haukel. The death of Allen is ex
pected at any moment.
Aiien was considerably under the mv
v fiuence of liquor during the evening and
endeavored to create a disturbance in th*
tenderloin district of the town. He or
dered a drink in a house and then, refused
Xo pay for it. The policeman was im
mediately summoned.
As Hankel entered the house Allen drew
a pistol and fired three shots at him. The
first bullet took effect in the policeman's
right leg near the knee. Hankel, although
pretty much disabled, vac not slow to re
turn the fire and managed to empty his
revolver in the direction of Allen, who re
treated to the rear of the house.
Allen made his exit by the back door
and Hankel hurried around the building
to intercept him. Then began another bat
tle. Allen had taken his stand near a
woodshed and fired at the approaching
officer. Hankel was again ready and
landed one bullet in the stomach of his
adversary. By this time, however, he
was weak from loss of blood and was
forced to discontinue the fight.
A passerby obtained a revolver at the
house and pursued Allen to the creek
bank, where the latter fell exhausted. He
Â¦was immediately arrested and conveyed
to a hospital. Hankel was taken to his
home, where the bullet in his leg was ex
tracted.

STORM FIRST,
THEN MUTINY
Exciting Occurrences on
a- Vessel in the
Horth.
Gale Tosses the Craft and
Sailors Demand Speedy
Return.
s
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. 25.â With a part of her
crew of twenty-four in mutiny and after
escaping shipwreck during a furious gale
in the Gulf of Georgia, by superhuman
effort the fishing schooner Rainier, Cap
tain A. Weiding in command, tied up at
Chlopeck's dock last night.
Trouble commenced aboard the vessel
directly after she left on last Wednesday
evening, bound for the Dixons Entrance
fishing grounds. Water was discovered
coming through the steamer's overboard
discharge pipes, which were afterward
iound to have been neglected. Captain
Weiding refuses to place the blame for
the-affair, but it is said that the engineers,
should have looked after the pipes befoie
the trip commenced. No harm was
caused by the small inflow, whicn at the
time did not amount to much. The vessel
was listed siignuy to port at the captain s
orders and any immediate aanger was
averted. The vdyage was continued.
On Thursday nignt the Gulf of Georgia
was reached. The weather became bad
and the wind soon attained the propor
tions of a gale. The leak became worse
and the steamer was pitched around UKe
a. cockle shell. The pitching, which was
violent, caused the bilge water, to swash
around and finally it closed up the strain
ers. The dirt from the interior of the hull
clogged up the outlet and the water kept
pouring in over the sides and through tne
pipes.
Gradually the Rainier was filling with
water. The captain and crew of the
steamer were cool and partly to that fact
they owe their lives. Bucket lines were
formed and the water was bailed out by
hand. It was brought up through the
engine-room and passed from man to man,
then thrown outside over a protecting
door. For three hours and a half the
Rainier struggled through the gale. Fin
ally the storm-driven vessel reached Cape
Mud and found a partially safe anchor
age behind protecting land. There she
remained until the worst of the storm was
over. Temporary repairs were made, so
far as could be accomplished under the
circumstances, and Captain Weiding de
cided to run for the nearest port and then
continue the voyage north.
At this announcement there was a mu
tiny. First Assistant Engineer Gale and
two of the firemen refused to continue the
voyage. They claimed that the vessel was
unsafe and after declining point blank to
obey the captain's orders the latter started
the steamer for home. He reached port
yesterday afternoon and reported the
facts to the Chlopeck Fish Company, who
own the steamer. They Immediately dis
charged the mutineers and part of the
crew.
RAIN CAUSES BREAK
IN A GIGANTIC DAM
LargÂ« â¢ Amount of Money Lost by
Escape of Lumber in Wash
ington.
TACOMA. Nov. 23.â The largest logging
boom in Southwestern Washington has
been nearly destroyed by the rainstorm
and freshets sweeping over this State dur
ing the past week. This bopm was built
in Wind River, its main feature being a
dam across the river fourteen miles above

lumbia. The dam was built by the Storey
& Keeler Lumber Company and had a
capacity of a hundred million feet of logs.
The boom covered 800 acres of surface,
v iih the water ranging from eight to
thirteen feet in depth. In another week
the dam would have been finished.
The break in it occurred during the high
water of Saturday night and by Sunday
en immense torrent was rushing through.
Millions of feet of logs have been lost and
they are still prssing out into the Colum
bia River and thence down the stream
toward the ocean. The loss amounts to
over ?10 : 000.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1901.
HAWAII'S HOME-RULE REPUBLICANS
DECLARE FOR CHINESE EXCLUSION
Adopt Resolutions Denouncing Acting Governor Cooper's Appeal
for Coolie Immigration and Urge Delegate Wilcox to Labor
in Congress for the Removal of Sanford B. Dole From Office
HONOLULU, Nov. 19.â Delegate
Robert W. Wilcox leaves for
Washington on the Oceanic
steamship Sierra, which carries
this letter. He is "instructed"
in the following resolutions, enthusiasti
cally carried last night by a mass meet
ing of Home Rule Republicans:
Whereas, Henry E. Cooper, as Acting Gov
ernor of the Territory of Hawaii, has submitted
his annual report for 1901 to the Secretary of
the Interior; and.
Whereas, The said report, under the subhead
"Labor," the Acting Governor has made state
ments absolutely at variance with the actual
conditions existing in these islands; conditions
which no man holding the high office of Gov
ernor and interested in the advancement of
civilization and the Americanizing of this Ter
ritory could either ignore or dare to deny; and.
Whereas, The entire report under this sub
head is couched in form inviting special legis
lation In the interests of the classes; now,
therefore, be It
Resolved, That the members of the Home
Rule Republican party, in mass-meeting as
sembled, do urge the Territorial Delegate to
Congress to use every effort to defeat the ob
ject of legislation invited and to devote his
entire energy to securing the re-enactment of
the Asiatic exclusion laws, because:
Firstâ Ninety per cent of the present Asiatic
population originally came to these islands as
contract laborers.
Secondâ Of the total Asiatic population there
are but 35 per cent employed on sugar plan
tations.
Compete With White Labor.
Thirdâ Not to exceed 25 'per cent of the re
mainder work in rice fields, the other three
fourths being active competitors in every me
chanical and industrial occupation as well as
In mercantile pursuits, with Americans in this
Territory to-day, and this circumstance, to
gether with our Hawaiian land laws, are the
potent factors preventing the influx of de
sirable American farmers and mechanics.
Fourthâ There are in these islands to-day
more than 12,000 Asiatics, who, had the Gov
ernment acted in good faith, would now be In
their native land, and we affirm without fear
of contradiction that any condition looking to
the return of any laborers to the place of their
nativity would be violated as was the law In
the case of these coolies.
Fifthâ The immigration of unskilled labor has
not ceased. There is a constant stream of
Porto Rican laborers coming to these islands,
assisted to these shores by the Planters' Labor
and Supply Company. These assisted immi
grants are a moat undesirable addition to our
island communityâ illiterate, impecunious, of
low vitality and lower morals. Many of them
occupy prison cells, either for crimes committed
or for vagrancy, thus through special privilege
another dangerous and burdensome element is
injected into our excessively cosmopolitan com
munity, to be assimilated at untold sacrifice to
the community at largeâ while creating condi
tions favorable to "the successful and economi
cal production of sugar."
Sixthâ The white man can speak for himself,
bat we are satisfied that he, like ourselves,
would work anywhere and at anything that
will yield him the value of his labor.
That the white man will not stoop to the
economics and associations of the "camp" or
"barracks" is a matter to his credit.
When "American" land laws pave the way to
"American" occupation of this Territory, the
Hawaiian-American will give cordial greeting
to those coming across the water to live in
our midst and "raise cane."
Seventhâ The relief, if any is required, Is
CAKELESS USE OF OIL
CAUSES FOTTR DEATHS
Young Woman Pours Kerosene on
Tire and Kills Herself and Three
Sisters.
PITTSBURG. Nov. 25.â Four persons
were burned to death and two seriously
injured in a fire at 4:30 o'clock this morn
ing which destroyed the residence of J.
G. Miller on Charies street, Knoxville, a
suburb of this city. The dead:
AMELIA MILLER, aged 19 years;
suffocated by the smoke.
AMANJJ.. ..^tjjEÃ, aged 16 years;
suffocated.
So. 'A MILLER, aged 9 years;
suffocated.
The injured: J. G. Miller, the father;
jumped from a second story window; leg
broken and bruised; will recover. Mrs.
Miller, badly burned and on verge of
nervous prostration.
The other daughters, aged 11 and 13
years, escaped without injury.
The fire was caused by the eldest
daughter. Rose, pouring kerosene in the
btove to start the fire for breakfast. The
oil in the can ignited and the explosion,
which was terrific, scattered the burning
oil over the room. The flames spread so
quickly that Miller was forced to jump
from the second story window after
rescuing his wife and two of his younger
daughters. Rose was burned almost to
a crisp and died before reaching the hos
pital. The three others were overcome by
the smoke. Their bodies were found in
the ruins after the fire had been ex
tinguished. Mrs. Miller was just recov
ering from a severe illness and Is almost
distracted over the terrible affair. Fears
are entertained that she will not survive
the shock.
Shoots and Kills His Partner.
SHERIDAN, Wyo., Nov. 25.â 1n a street
duel this morning Lee Hartsough shot
and instantly killed G. C. McLaughlin,
his partner. The men ran a livery stable
and auarreled over the hiring of a hos
tler. McLaughlin fell at the first fire.
This is the second killing to occur Jn
Sheridan in less than a week.

i
at hand. We already have a large surplus of
Asiatics in our midst. A slight increase of
wages will bring all that are required on the
plantations.
Demands Removal of Dole.
These resolutions were passed as read,
as wera the following:
Whereas, The Governor of this Territory is
personally soliciting loans on Government ac
count, from private sources, pledging therefor
the public credit and guaranteeing that, as
heretofore, illegal acts of this kind will be
ratified and provision made for their payment
by the next Legislature; and.
Whereas, The Superintendent of Public Works
has been and now is making agreements, in
advance of legislative action, whereby the
credit of this Territory is pledged to private
corporations for materials to be furnished and
labor to be performed (said agreements being
themselves violations of law In that there has
been no call for tenders as required for work
or materials to the value of $500 or over) ; and,
Wnereas, These and kindred acts of the ex
ecutive are in plain violation of law and sub
versive of those principles of democracy con
templated by the constitution of the United
States and the organic act creating the Ter
ritory of Hawaii; and.
Whereas. There Is ample opportunity for
promptly creating the legal conditions neces
sary for meeting present requirements without
resort to the questionable practices herein
complained of: now. therefore, be it
Resolved. That the Territorial Delegate to
Congress be respectfully requested to Inform

THIEVES ASSAULT
MILKMAN TWICE
On Second Hold-Up the
Victim Delivers His
Coin.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 25.
Percy Lee, a milkman, had a lively ex
perience to-night with a brace of foot
pads. He was twice assaulted. He van
quished his assailants on the first on
slaught, but yielded to the searching pro
cess and delivered a small sum of money
the second time. In a short time after
he reported the matter to the police he
had the satisfaction of identifying his as
sailants.
While Lee was about to deliver milk at
a residence at Eleventh and Jefferson
streets two men approached him and de
manded his money. He swung the can
in which he was carrying the milk and
discomfited his assailants. Then he pro
ceeded on his rounds. He had not
gone more than three blocks away
from the point of the first attack when ne
was again assaulted at the corner of
Ninth and Grove streets.
One of the men who attacked him threw
his arm around his neck, while his com
panion went through his pockets. The
robbers secured $4 85. Lee lost no time in
reporting the matter to the police. Ser
geant Green and Police Officer Flynn were
detailed to find the men. Half an hour
later they had Edward Nelson and Joseph
McCauley in custody. Lee was sent for
and identified them as the thieves who
held him up both times. As they could
give no satisfactory explanation of their
movements during tha night, they were
booked on two charges of robbery. Both
men are said to be ex-convicts, and the
police are lookinsr ud their records.
of the executive and make him and the heads
of departments personally responsible for ob
ligations created by them.
Cooper's Flea for Coolies.
Speaking of the Asiatic labor question,
a significant point has been made by
white Republicans. They recall that Gov
ernor Dole, in his Inaugural addresa,
hailed annexation as ushering In Ameri
lanism in the settlement and development
>f the country, contradistinguished to the
A.siaticizing process to which the sugar
planting Interests had for many years
been subjecting the islands. These In
augural utterances of the Governor are
pitted against the piteous appeal of Act
ing Governor Cooper, during the disabil
ity of Dole, in the report of the Terri
torial executive to the Secretary of the
Interior for the admission of Asiatic labor
to save the plantations.
The reference to Government contracts
in the Home Rule Republican resolutions
Â« is based on a glaring instance of evasion
of the Territorial law now being enacted.
There is great need of new wharf accom
modation, especially in view of the levia
thans of the Pacific Mail soon to come
here. In the present dearth of revenues
the Government has no means for sup
plying the want. Under these circum
stances, H. Hackfeld & Co., agents for
the Pacific Mail steamers, offered to sup
ply the funds for constructing a new
wharf and the Government employed Cot
ton Bros. & Co. to do the work, trusting
to a future Legislature to reimburse
Hackfeld. There is a law of the Terri
tory, however, forbidding any public work
costing more than $500 without submission
to open tender.
In the meantime the wharf construc
tion has been attacked by a private an
tagonist. The Oahu Railway and Land
Company, which secured fourteen years
ago from the then Thurston Government
a practical gift of a valuable streak of
harbor frontage, has sued for an injunc
tion against the Superintendent of Public
Works and Cotton Bros. & Co. Proceed
ings have reached the stage of the filing
of a demurrer by the Cottons, but were
postponed this afternoon until Monday in
the United States District Court owing
to the absence of James H. Boyd, Super
intendent of Public Works.
WILCOX IS NON-COMMITTAL.
Says There Is a Division of Senti
ment Among Constituents.
Delegate to Congress R. W. Wilcox of
Hawaii arrived in the city yesterday and
is at the Occidental. He says that there
is a division of opinion on the islands in
reference to Chinese exclusion. The labor
ing classes are anxious to have the Jap
anese as well as the Chinese barred. On
the other hand rich planters are desirous
that Chinese be allowed to land. The
Chinese, says Wilcox, are the only ones
that can be induced to work in the rice
fields, which are flooded at certain seasons
of the year.
Delegate Wilcox says that he feels as
sured that Congress will take some action
this session in reference to making an al
lowance for ex-Queen Liliuokalani. She
would be satisfied if she were voted a
quarter of a million dollars and he be
lieves that would be tioth a reasonable
and fair amount.
GAS ENGINE BELT
CAUSES FATAL INJURY
Son of Senator Cox of Sacramento
Killed in Accident at a
Ranch.
BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 25.â Croft J. Cox,
son of Senator Cox of Sacramento and
superintendent of the Cox & Clarke in
terests in Jhis county, was Injured to-day
by being caught in a machinery belt at
the Cox-Clarke ranch, near Wasco, twen
ty-eight miles from this city, and hia
death occurred a few nours later.
Cox was at work about a buzz saw,
which was^run by a belt attached to a
gas engine. In some unaccountable man
ner his clothing became entangled in tho
belt. Before the machinery could be
stopped he had sustained fractures of a
leg and an arm and severe bruises of the
face and scalp.

STORM CAUSES
HEAVY LOSSES
Many Buildings at Long
Branch Are Badly
Damaged.
Five Members of a Wrecked
Barge Are Reported
Drowned.
NEW YORK. Nov. 25.â Reports of the
damage done by the storm of Saturday
night and Sunday continue to come in.
Details from points on the Jersey coast,
the southern coast of Long Island and the
upper shore of Long Island Sound show
that the destruction was widespread and
the monetary loss much heavier than at
first supposed.
Long Branch reports to-night show that
hardly a building there escaped some
damage. As evidence of the force of the
wind, a plank about twenty feet long,
seven inches wide and two inches thick
was torn from the roof of the pier pavil
ion and blown across Ocean avenue. It
struck Lenox Hotel end-on and wa3
driven into the side of the building to a
depth of four or five feet.
The wreck of the tug Haddon at Long
Branch is complete. The ship Flotbek
stands almost upright in the sand. The
work of unrigging her commenced to-day.
She will be unloaded as she lies. This will
be comparatively easy. All that will be
needed will be to back wagons up to her
side at low tide and load the cargo into
them.
The wealthy New Yorkers who have
summer houses on the upper shore of the
Sound to-day visited them to find wreck
and ruin in all directions. The shore
walks are in ruins while fine shade trees
are laid low and extensive lawns plied
high with sand and wreckage.
The s"torm-bound shipping was released
early to-day, but the seacoast railway
and trolley service will be poor until the
Â¦washouts are filled in. Linemen weiv
busy restoring prostrated telegraph ani
telephone wires to-day, but it will be a
couple of days before these services are
completely restored.
The extent of the damage to the Rapid
Transit tunnel was not fully determined
10-day.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 25.â Advices re
ceived to-day by the Maritime Exchange
state that five men were drowned yester
day at Long Branch during the height
of the northeast storm which swept the
Atlantic coast Saturday night and Sun
day. The men are supposed to have been
members of the crews of the barges Wil
irore and Grant, which were lost by the
tug Eureka, which arrived in New York
yesterday and reported that she had lost
her tow and had no tidings of either crew.
The two barges came ashore at Chad
wick, N. J., about one and a half miles
south of Long Branch. There were sever,
men on the barges when they went
ashore. All of the crew of four on one
of the barges were washed overboard and
lost, while the life savers, with the aid
of the breeches buoy, saved two of the
men on the other barge. The third was
washed overboard and drowned.
Further advices to the Maritime Ex
change report the loss of the barges H.
A. Hawgood for Providence, Mercedila
for London and Davis for Fall River.
The crews were all saved.
VINEYARDHAVEN, Mass., Nov. 25.â
Cut off from communication with the
mainland by cable for twenty-four hours,
the people of Marthas Vineyard expe
rienced during Saturday night and Sun
day the heaviest northeast gale since No
vember, 1598. Both on shore and in the
harbor considerable damage was done.
The main damage on shore was the de
struction of the new carshed which has
just been completed for the Marthas
Vineyard Electric Company. Telephone
and telegraph wires and poles were pros
trated all over the Island.

first time on Thursday Might and did not
reach his room until :2 o'clock Friday

on Saturday morning (and demanded to ba
let in. He was told the household had
gone to Port Wasl lington. Hamilton
started for Long Islj .nd. The caretaker
telephoned that the butler was coming
and the man at the door of ''Castle
Gould" at Port Wi '.shington was told
what to do when he came.
Hamilton walked 'up to the front door
and was hurled out upon the lawn by two
men who had for two short days been
his official inferior*'. He sought oppor
tunity for thought in a clump of shrub
bery. He emerged at dusk and made for
the kitchen. A maid let him in and set
cold meats before nim.
Mrs. Gould went to the kitchen and in
formed Hamilton tXat he was no longer
employed by her. He smiled at Mrs.
Gould benignly arxl went on eating. The
cook and the scullery man organized an
ejection posse and had got Hamilton as
far as the door, W-th a considerable sac
rifice of furniture and crockery, when
Mrs. Gould succeeded in making herself
heard above the dio. SheÂ» said she wanted
a policeman called.
On the arrival of the .Port Washington
constable, Hamilton surrendered and went
away peaceably. Hamilton was held in
$400 bonds to keep the peace for a year.
In default of bonds hÂ«: was sent to the

MOUNCE RIDES A TRIO OF WINNERS
PAST WIRE AT OAKLAND TRACK
Bookmakers Finally Get a "Break" and Make Quite a Clean-Up.
Flying Torpedo Causes Bedeck to Look Like a Selling Plater.
Sharp Bird Is Beaten Out by the ioto-l Shot, Ned Dennis
IF the books did not get the money
yesterday they never will get it. The'
track was, very heavy, and. had, not
Muresca escaped the slaughter of the
favorites would have been complete.
Always a capital mariner -in stormy
weather, Owen Mouncf, the Idaho boy,
who was decried by the Eastern critics
as a dunce, landed the 'winners of the
last three races, all at fascinating prices:
In fact, his handling of Hungarian, Nfed
Dennis and JFloronso was so masterful
that it overshadowed all other features
of the afternoon's sport.
For an introduction ten maiden two
year-olds went to the post in a six-fur
long scramble. Bullman on Arthur Ray,
a 12 to 1 shot, gave lm company the slip,
and the husky son of Nomad simply driz
zled in ahead of The Ladaen and Milas.
Rosarie was made favorite, but apparent
ly could do nothing in *he stiff going, for
she finished third from last.
"Frisco" Lind didn't think there was a
chance to beat Muresca in the five-furlong
purse dash, and from the way she rar.
there wasn't. Starting a sizzling hot fa
vorite and breaking from somewhere near
the center of the bunch to none too good
a start, the filly quickly showed first.
Then there was no neading her, for she
won hands down five lengths in front of
Sol Lichtenstein. Ransom, the large-head
ed little man from Chicago, 111., rode Rio
de Altar, just as many an exercise boy
before him has done, linishing third. The
horse can do better.
Ex-Jockey J. Gardner's horse Bedeck
appeared in the third act. a mile and sev
enty yards run, decided under selling con
ditions. From the Btaxt the Star Ruby
horse was never in it. Flying Torpedo
winning all the way. The winner received
considerable support, while the favorite's
odds receded in the betting.
O'Connor next had the leg up on Red
wald, the even money choice for the sev
en-furlong affair, fourch on the card. De
spite some strong urging that the first
choice took Hungarian showed in front at
the first roadhouse, and passed the stand
nearly three lengths to the goos. Hercu
lean, the second choice, was left at the
post.
Possibly some days ago Harry Stover's
"bird" Native may have kept the wires
as warm as Sharp Bird, but it is doubt
ful. Louis Ezell's horse, when speculating
began on the race next to the last, nearly
caused the bookmakers to be swamped.
Birkenruth straddled the good thing and
in an exciting drive lost the verdict by
half a length to Mounce on Ned Dennis,
a 10 to 1 shot. Native, a bit late, ran
third.
Overlooked by the general run of race
goers. Floronso again scored a home run.
Nicely rated in the final mile and a six
teenth run by Mounce. the gelding passed
Castake and Lodestar the last furlong
and won with considerable to spare. John
McGurk, the favorite, ran into a stiff
southeaster just after passing the quarter
pole, becoming a drifting derelict.
Track Notes.
E. C. Hopper, the popular Latonia rac
ing official, resumed his position of asso
ciate judge in the stand at Oakland yes
terday.
Joe Piggott. full of "kopecks" and talk
as usual, arrived from Russia last night.
Cash Sloan wired the new California
Jockey Club officials yesterday from New
York, asking if a license would be granted
him if he came here to ride. He was an
swered in the affirmative. Soon as Cash
learned to speak the Russian language
he is reported to have made a great deal
of money over in that country.
Following are the entries and weights
for the $2500 Thanksgiving handicap:
A handicap for three-year-olds and upward.
Winners of other than a selling purse after the
weights are announced to carry five pounds
extra. To be run Thursday, November 28, 1901.

Gill Summers perhaps has a hard luck
story. Herculean was left at the post in
the fourth event and was then claimed
by H. C. Ahlers, owner of Alas, for $723.
The big chestnut was entered to be sold
for $400.
Gus Bluhm. the widely known Chicago
Vir.i.kmaker. got in Sunday night and was
a sp^ctatnr at the track yesterday.
Birkenruth piloted Muresca and Flying
Torpedo pa.=t the wire first, but his effort
on John McGurk would cause a blind man
to drop his organ crank. It was not a
bad ride; it was simply a "rotten" one.
This German named rider may have been
told that he was coming out in the
"bushes 1 ' to pilot horses.
On a par with Birkenruth's effort was
the mess Vtttatce put up on Cromwell.

subdued the aspirations of Kennedy in
â¢two straight games. The last named was
Unable to do anything with Bowman's

although he has lost one stands a good
chance to finish' in the lead in the second

B EW^AD VERTISEMENTS.
NEW SCIENTIFIC PROCESS.
A Preparation Discovered That Will
Destroy the Dandruff Germ.
For some time it has been known that
dandruff is caused by a germ that digs
up the scalps into little white flakes, and
by sapping the vitality of the hair at the
root, causes falling hair, and, of course,
finally baldness. For years there have
been all kinds of hair stimulants and
scalp tonics on the market, but there has
been no permanent cure for dandruff
until the discovery of a preparation
called Newbros Herpicide, which de-
stroys the dandruff germ. Destroy the
cause the effect will cease to exist. Kill
the dandruff germ and you'll have no
dandruff, no itching scalp, no falling

| and neither man played fast enough to
keep warm. Ferguson might have won
if his hands had not been sore. Clough
secured the rubber by pure grit.
Oatie Crable had a hard struggle with
Guy Ransome. Three games were neces
sary to decide the match and Crable had
his hands full securing two of them. Beth
men were troubled by the lights. The
scores were 21-12, 7-21 and 21-15.
The final congest of the c% r ening was be
tween Nat Hewson and George LiUlefield.
Hewson played in championship form and
won out handily. He possesses a terrifio
toss and let it go at his opponent through
out the game. Littlefield was only able
'to return it weakly and Hewson would
"kill." The score was 21-5, 21-4.
The games scheduled for this evening
are:
Third classâ Cortes vs. Sherry; second
rlassâ Judge Fritz vs. Pockwitz; first
classâ Prendergast vs. Kennedy.
There is every likelihood that Prender
-gast and Pockwitz will win their games
by default, as neither Fritz nor Kennedy
intends continuing the tournament.

W., WASHINGTON. Nov. 25.-The Gov
ernment's wireless telegraph system will

Increased, and â¢ the perfection .of a system of

FITZ TO FIGHT
WITH JEFFRIES
Another Championship
Contest for San
Francisco.
Australian Trains in Secret
for Match With the Big
Californian.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK/ Nov. 25.â The indications
are that Fitzsimmons will again enter
the ring against Jeffries for the cham
pionship of the world in San Francisco
some time in February.
This announcement, made by Kennedy,
is not the first indication that Fitzsim
mons was seriously considering the plan
of taking on one more fight. He has
been quietly training at his cottage in
Bensonhurst during the past three weeks.
To personal friends who saw him work
he intimated that he was preparing him
self physically in anticipation of a bout
for the championship. Fitzsimmons is
very crafty, in or out of the ring, and
his future actions will be watched with
much interest.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 25.-Jim Jeffries
and his manager, Billy Delaney, were in
Portland to-day. Mr. Delaney is jubi
lant over the fact that Fitzsimmons has
expressed himself as willing to meet Jeff
ries. Delaney made the following state
ment:
"I am pleased to hear from New York
by telegraph this evening that Fitzsim
mons has signified his willingness to
meet Jeffries in February. Jeffries is
glad that the fight will take place on
California soil. We shall go to New
York, where Jeffries will have a personal
interview with Fitzsimmons and prob
ably sign articles there."
LIPTON STILL HAS HOPES
OF TAKING BACK THE CTJP
Should No One Else Challenge, Ho
Will Again Compete With the
American Yacht.
LONDON, Nov. 25.â "Should no one else
challenge, I am willing seriously to con
sider making another attempt to lift the
cup."
This announcement was given out by
Sir Thomas Lipton at the banquet given
at the Hotel Cecil in his honor to-night
and which was attended by more than
400 guests.
"It would never do," added Sir Thomas,
"to give up when only a pulse beat came
between us and victory."
The reception to^h'e challenger for the
America's cup walk marked with the
greatest enthusiasm and all classes were
represented at the banquet this evening.
Lord Tweedmouth acted as chairman and,
proposing the health of President Roose
velt, he referred to his versatility as a
statesman, politician, sportsman and
writer. President Roosevelt's name was
greeted with tremendous applause, al
though only a few Americans were pres
ent.
While Sir Thomas paid glowing compli
ments to the United States, he confessed
his chagrin at being unable to "put on
that table the famous old mug."
He offered both the Shamrocks as trial
boats to any Britisher anxious to chal
lenge and closed his remarks with the
declaration that he would be willing to
make another attempt for the cup should
no one else do so, and expressing his con
fidence that the third Shamrock would
have the luck of the three leafed Sham
rock.

til the dog was beaten off. About a quar
ter to 1 o'clock Edward yon Huwaldt,
a well known mining man, was walking
along the street, followed by his bull ter
rier. Suddenly Yon Huwaldt was seized
with an epileptic fit. pitched from the
sidewalk to the muddy street three feet
below. His dog sprang with him and
stood beside his prostrate body.
A passer-by summoned help, and sev
eral men went to lift Yon Huwaldt up.
The dog bit at them fiercely and drove
them back. Others tried to reach him
and were driven off. Finally a man at
tacked the dog and kicked him into sub
missiveness. Even then the faithful ani
mal was game and howled his protest.
It war. found that Yon Huwaldfs right
leg was broken above the ankle.

FOR GOOD MEN
Herrin Machine Wrecked
Beyond Hope of
Repair.
The Labor Leaders Decline
Fusion With Democratic
jl Politicians.
Since the recent municipal election in
San Francisco, Herrin, Burns, Gage and
Lynch have not made a move. They have
been wandering around in a dazed sort
cf manner, casting curious glances at the
hopelessly wrecked political machine, and
Â¦wondering' how the smash happened. It
Vifi doubtful if they can muster up cour
age to assail the primary election law,
although they comprehend that the ma
ehir.e cannot be reconstructed if the pri
mary law stands.
At this time the signs promise a State
convention of representative Republicans
to nominate Justices of the Supreme
Court, a Governor and other State of
lk'ers. It is possible that a sentiment in
r of first nominating candidates for
the judiciary may be awakened, so that
eminent lawyers who are ready to serve
as Justices of the Supreme Court may not
mpeUed to make or countenance
P"litical combinations. Moreover, can
es for judicial honors will not be ex
Â¦ d to kowtow to Herrin of the South
ern Pacific law department, and young
attorneys will not be obliged to get the
consent of allied corporations to attend
The convention. If the primary election
law is maintained, creditable delegations
from San Francisco, Alameda and Los
Angeles will exert a powerful influence in
the convention for the cause of clean
politics.
Little Talk of Combine.
Since the municipal election in this city
there has been very little talk in political
circles concerning the combine to nomi
nate Judge Sweeny of Shasta, a San
Francisco lawyer and a Los Angeles
Judge for the Supreme Court. The
nal } rogramme provided that the
machine would carry the Supreme Court
candidates in the Gage band wagon, but
Â¦ the wreck nothing has been said
about the judiciary. The race seems to
i the best lawyers of the State.
r.ds of Chief Justice Beatty and the
irters of Judges Buckles, Ellison,
lottl. Day and others may present
their claims to the convention. It is
noted that Judge Angellotti is well sus
tained by lawyers in this region of the
State. Judge Day of Los Angeles stands
in high favor in the south.
Leaders of the Union Labor party are
apprised of the fact that Democratic as
pirants for office are adjusting wires with
lew of bringing about a fusion of
the two parties. The eager Democrats
hope to gain a share of the official spoils
by such fusion. The Union Labor lead
ers, however, say "No." and say it with
an emphasis that signifies a negative
meaning.
Politics in San Jose.
At the spring election in San Jose the
Labor party will put forth a ticket and
perhaps try conclusions with Johnny Mc-
Kenzie or Jim Rea. In Alameda County
the Labor party may enter the field. The
riers of the San Francisco executive
committee are in correspondence with
leaders in Alameda and Santa Clara coun
ties. Plans fcr a general organization
throuphout the State have been suggested,
but have not received close attention. It
seems to be settled, however, that propo
sitions to fuse with the Democrats will
not be entertained. The fact is considered
that several of the Democratic lawyers
who are anxious for amalgamation on the
basis of g-eneral work for the extension
of ihe exclusion act have a record for ex-
traordinary zeal in bringing Chinese
re through the aeency of the Collec
tor's office and the Federal courts. It is
-tunate for these statesmen that a
vr newspaper assailed the record of
id M. Shortridge on the Chinese
question, because the assault has directed
public notice to the insincerity of leading
Democratic advocates of exclusion.
Hon. Eugene F. Loud, member of Con
jrress. representing the Fifth California
District, left the city for the national capi
tal yesterday. Mr. Loud is serving his
sixth term in the House of Representa
tives and holds a high position in that
body. He is chairman of the important
Committee on Postofiices and Post Roads
and is recognized throughout the country
as an authority on postal subjects.
Can Use Duckwell Creek Water.
The Suprc-me Court decided yesterday
he Tuolumne Mining Company is
entitled to the water which it di
verted from Duckwell Creek by means of
a ditch. A. C. Maier. who also utilized
the creek water, claimed that the rival
comparv was defrauding him.

WAND WTLL REFEREE
QUEENAN-O'BRIEN BOUT
Special Contests to Be Fought at the
Olympic Club on Next Friday
Evening.
Phil Wand, the well-known referee, has
been chosen to officiate in the ring to
night at the contest between Perry
Queenan and Jack O'Brien, who battle
twenty rounds before the Sacramento
Athletic Club. Wand will leave this morn
ing for the scene of battle.
Art Simms, the clever iightweight, who
dropped into town a few days ago, is out
with a challenge to meet the winner of
this contest. Simms came here to rest,
but is willing to try his skill against any
of the lightweights now on the coast.
Through his manager, Tim McGrath, he
announces his willingness to meet La
vigne, Heggarty, or any of the top-notch
ers. Simms is the only man who ever
knocked out Jack Hamilton, the boxer
who has given such able ring generals as
Erne, O'Brien and others hard contests.
Simms has none of the earmarks of a
pugilist. He might be mistaken for a dry
goods clerk. Despite his appearance, he is
there with both hands, and when he lands
he usually scores a knockout.
The bouts to be brought off at the Olym
pic Club on Friday night are attracting
wide attention. They have been speclally
arranged and the contestants will battle
for handsome trophies.
Robert Johnson will box four rounds
with Barney Driscoll at 105 pounds; L.
Richards will meet Paul Martin at 125
pounds; Joe Neilan and Frank George
will box four rounds at 132 pounds; E.
Arens and H. Baker will battle at 145
pounds; Jimmie Britt and Fred Bell will
contest four rounds at catch weights and
Sam Berger and Andy Gallagher will spar
four rounds at the heavy-weight limit.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
bring off its monthly boxing exhibition on
the same evening. Manager Greggalns
has prepared an excellent card for his pa
trons. The bouts are as follows:
Willie Bourne vs. John Crowel, 105 pounds-
Dick Cullen vs. Monte Attell, 110; Steve Kerns
vs. Frank Quigg, 120; Fred 1 Landers vs Teby
Everett 125; Ed Martin vs. William Ingham
135; Charles Peterson vs. Arthur Watson, 138-
Charles Bernard vs. Jack McDonald, 150; Bob

DENNETT SAYS
HE IS BANKRUPT
Restaurant Owner Owes
Many Thousands of
Dollars.
Missionaries All Over the
World Figure as Big
Creditors.
Alfred W. Dennett, whose name has
been an index throughout the country for
temperance restaurants, filed papers of
insolvency yesterday in the United States
District Court. He gives his occupation
as a restaurant keeper and his residence
as San Francisco. Dennett's debts are
figured up at $92,667 68 in the petition for
insolvency.
During the last ten years Dennett has
not been interested in the restaurants
which bear his name. There are seven
teen of these houses and they stretch
Irom New York to Chicago. Vast sums
ot money were expendea in fitting up
these restaurants, one in New York cost
ing J85.000. And now all that Dennett
claims to have are some mining interests
which took much of his money and a $20
suit of clothes. Of the $92,667 6S deDt, $52,
675 is unsecured.
Nearly all the creditors reside in the
Eastern States. Among the large credi
tors Is Mrs. Ada Lee of Calcutta, India,
her credit being a missionary subscrip
tion with interest at 6 per cent per an
num aggregating $15,000. The Dover-
Street Mission in Boston is a creditor for
a subscription of $300 and V. D. Daird of
Colombo, Ceylon, is creditor for a mis

Dennett Tells His Story.
Mr. Dennett in pn m'.erview last night
said the reason he had asked for letters
of insolvency was that he might start
anew with the assistance of friends in
working his mining interests. He said:
Ten jears ago I failed for $270,000. At that
time I hypothecated all my stock in the Den
nett Restaurant Corporation. I was com
pelled to resign my position as president of
the corporation. Since then I have had no
connection with any of the restaurants con
ducted under my name. I have been entirely
engaged in conducting my peisonal affairs.
Among my assets is a farm in Illinois known
as the Abraham Lincoln farm. My reason for
filing a petition of insolvency was to free my
self from all complications and to protect my
friends, who are going to start me in a mining
enterprise in Mexico.
A. W. Dennett commenced his career in
a humble Park Row coffee restaurant in
New York in 1876. From that he branched
out until he was known all over the
United States. His restaurants grew un
til they brought him an annual income
of $150,000. He is now 63 years of age and
is preparing to commence all over again.
NEW YOBKERS HOLD THEIR
SECOND ANNUAL BANQUET
Almost 100 Natives of Empire State
Assemble Around Prettily
Decorated Tables.
The second annual banquet of the New
Yorkers, which was held last night at the
Occidental Hotel, proved a most delight
ful affair. Almost a hundred natives of
the Empire State were assembled around
the festal tables, Â¦ which were daintily
decorated with ferns. Around the walls
of the banquet hall were strung long
streamers of red, white and blue, while
at each end of the room were suspended
beautiful American flags. The evening
was most pleasantly passed with songs,
which carried the thoughts of many of
those present back to scenes far away,
and incidents which have happened in the
history of their native State.
The toasts were few in number, but
were rsponded to in the most happy vein.
J. E. Field paid a glowing tribute to the
greatness of the United States of Amer
ica W. W. Stone sang the praises of the
Empire State, while J. V. Coleman paid,
his respects to the beauties of California.
Max Popper acted as president of the
evening and concluded the speechmaking
#ith a toast to "The Organization." Let
ters were read from Secretary George
B. Cortelyou, who sent the regrets of
President Roosevelt, and from B. B. Odell,
Governor of the State of New York.
President Rooeevelt and Governor Odell
are both honorary members of the New
Yorkers' organization.
ARE TO INVESTIGATE
MRS. STEPHENS' DEATH
Relatives Refuse to Believe That Un
fortunate Woman Ended Her
Own Life.
The relatives of the late Mrs. Emily
Stephens, who was found dead in her
room with the gas turned on and a partly
emptied bottle of muriatic acid on the
bureau, refuse to accept the general be
lief that the unfortunate woman com
mitted suicide. Her brother, Frank Spen
cer has started an investigation of the
circumstances surrounding her death. He
has had the stomach removed and sent
to the city chemist for examination. He
says he is convinced that she did not take
her own life, but that she was slowly
poisoned to death. Spencer says that he
will file charges with the police to-day.
In the investigation which he made yes
terday Spencer claims that he discovered
that while his sister was supposed to be
breathing her last a neighbor, Mrs.
Brown, heard cries of "Help," "Murder"
and "Police." He says that he also dis
covered that a door and a window leading
into the room where his sister was lying
were open. This, he claims, disproves the
theory that her death was partly due to
the poisonous vapor. Henry Borgwardt,
a butcher's boy, will be depended upon
by Spencer to bear out his statement in
regard to the open door and window. He
will also endeavor to prove that pois6n
was introduced into medicine that was
being taken by Mrs. Stephens.
Sewage, as a Fertilizer.
The Board of Public Works has re
quested the Board of Supervisors to per
mit the extension of the H-street sewer
to a temporary outfall near Twentieth
avenue. It is proposed to deliver the
sewage Into the dunes of Golden Gate
Park to fertilize trees, said to be dying.
An aseptic tank will be built and a
saving of $8000 effected in constructing the
sewer.
Ball at TJnion-Square Hall.
The Western Union Social Club will
hold its first annual entertainment and
ball this evening at Union-square Hall.
An excellent programme has been ar
ranged for the occasion and the com
mittees have worked with diligence to
make the affair a success. The entertain
ment will be concluded with a one- act
comedy entitled "A Mixed Affair."

SINGLE-HANDED
American Lieutenant's
Brave Charge Near
Cavite.
MANILA, Nov. 25.â Second Lieutenant
Louis J. Van Schaeck of the Fourth In
fantry, while scouting with a few men of
that regiment, met 150 insurgents who had
attacked and sacked the hamlet of Sia
raca, near Cavite. Upon seeing the Fili
pinos, Van Schaeck ordered his men to
charge them. The command was obeyed,
and Van Schaeck, being mounted, reached
the insurgents sixty yards in advance of
his men. He killed three of them with
his revolver. An insurgent fired his re
volver point blank at Van Schaeck, but
missed. The lieutenant was then knocked
from his horse. #
He jumped to his feet and engaged in
a hand to hand conflict with the enemy,
using the butt, of his revolver. He sus
tained two severe wounds, one of which
nearly severed his wrist.
At this point the lieutenant's men ar
rived, rescued him and put the insur
gents to flight. Van Schaeck is in the
military hospital in Manila and is doing
veil. He had already been recommended
for a medal of honor for bravery in a
previous engagement.
General Hughes, commander of the De
partment of the Visayas, reports that ne
gotiations are about completed for the
surrender of the insurgent leader Sam
son, on Bofcol Island. This surrender will
doubtless end the revolution against the
American authority in Bohol, as Samson
is acknowledged to be the greatest Insur
gent leader there.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.â Secretary

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 25.â An action
was brought in the Superior Court to-day
by E. L. Zeefo & Co. of San Francisco to
recover possession of $4657, asserted to be
on deposit in the State Bank and Trust
Company of Los Angeles to the credit of
Simeon Ivanov Grin. It is alleged that
the money was given by the plaintiffs to
be used in their business in the Russian
Empire, but that Grin converted the
money to his own use, and under the as
sumed name of Valentine Senaska depos
ited the money with the Los Angeles
bank. A temporary restraining order
was issued to prevent a withdrawal of
the money from the bank pending the
trial of the case.

debris will put it in condition for train 3
in a few hours. No rause is known for
the wreck, although it is supposed that
the rails spread beneath the heavily load

riding the rods under a car which turned
completely over, but ail escaped without
a scratch.

LINCOLN MONUMENT LEAGUE.
BY the Lincoln Monument League there has
been issued a circular letter inviting the recipi
ents to attend a meeting to be held at the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday
afternoon. The letter presents strong reasons why
tht meeting should be well attended, and it is to be
hoped the expectations of the committee will not be
disappointed. The object of the league cannot fail to
have the sympathy of every American citizen who is
capable of appreciating the worth of Lincoln's serv
ices to the Union, and where there is sympathy there
ought to be also a willingness to help.
The league was organized in March, 1897, and has
ever since been active. It has formed committees on
which many of our most eminent citizens are serving.
Its energies and influence have extended beyond the
limits of the State and it has been instrumental in
tstabiishing the observance of Lincoln day in fifteen
States and several Territories. It has distributed more
than eleven thousand certificates of membership and
in many ether ways ha? brought about a fuller recog
nition of the memory of Lincoln than would have
prevailed but for the work of the league. In all that
accomplishment, however, comparatively little has
been gained in the way of contributions toward the
erection cl tike proposed memorial on the Pacific
Coas-t. and it is to achieve something in that direction
that the proposed meeting has been called.
It appears that the money thus far raised has been
obtained mainly through the sale of certificates at
twenty-five cents each, ten-cent subscriptions among
school children and citizens generally, and by contri
butions from the veterans of the military service. The
net amount accumulated and available is about $3000,
a sum utterly inadequate for the desired memorial,
which, as the circular says, "ought not to cost less
than $100,000 if justice is to be done to the occasion
and to ihe subject." *
It is to be borne in mind that virtually every dol
lar collected for the fund is available for the purpose.
Eveiy fraction of the work of the league has been
gratuitously performed. No salaries nor office rent
have been paid. The expenses have been strictly lim
ited to the sums required for the purchase of station
:he cost of necessary printing and the rent of
halls when needful.
Upon that showing and with so patriotic an object
in view, the league has certainly a right to expect
liberal support from the public in the prosecution of
its work. It is time the enterprise were taken up
with zeal and energy. It is true we have also under
way at this time a movement for the erection of a
memorial to McKinley, but that should not in any
way impede the work of the Lincoln Monument
League. San Francisco is rich enough to support
both movements. The meeting that has been called
should be attended by men prepared to give a new
impulse to the enterprise and to reawaken the pat
riotic enthusiasm of the people. Let us have a Lin
coln memorial that will be worthy of the city and of
the man â one that will rank among the most notable
memorial structures oi the country.
Some time ago certain enterprising men in Chicago
established a line of steamers to run direct from Chi
cago to European ports, and there was much talk at
the time of the probability that New York would be
made a way station; but now the line of steamers has
been transferred to the Atlantic coast trade, and
neither Chicago nor Europe will ever sec them again.
The deer season ha.s closed in New York, and in

A Missouri court hns decided that a woman who

COMMISSIONER EiDsonsr.
COMMISSIONER EDSON, in your own behalf, as well as in the interests of the
people of California, The Call warns you this morning to consider carefully the
situation in which you stand and to take heed lest you fall. You have been in
the past highly esteemed by your friends and acquaintances, by your constitu
ents and by the public, generally. The esteem has not been lightly founded. It has been
based upon a confidence in your sterling honesty. Among those by whom you are known
you could buy $100,000 worth of cattle on your promise to pay â your word was as good
as your bond. The trustfulness in you has extended to politics as well as to business.
Your election as Railroad Commissioner was due to n faith that in office you would have
the intelligence to know what was right and the courage to perform your duty. So wide
spread and so deeply founded was the confidence in your official integrity that you have
been spoken of as 1 fitting man for Governor of the State. That good repute has been
yours, and it will be your own fault if you forfeit it.
You cannot be ignorant of the fact that the old-time confidence in you has begun to
waver, nor can you be doubtful of the cause. It is but a short time ago that after hear
ing ample evidence from both sides you voted for a reduction in railroad rates on oil.
That action was approved, and it was with surprise the public noted your recent action in
voting to invalidate the decision you had given after that hearing. There had been no
new evidence introduced into the case to afford even a seeming justification of your
change of mind. So far as the people could see you had given a decision upon testi
mony heard in public; and then for some reason urged in private you had been induced
to invalidate your own decision.
You cannot deny even to yourself that a change of mind of that kind under such cir
cumstances is in its very nature suspicious. You cannot be surprised that it has led your
constituents and your friends to wonder what were the inducements that led to the change,
and what you are to do next.
It is not strange that suspicion once aroused should have looked closely to your re
lations with W. F. Herrin. It is known that Herrin's professional and political fortunes
are at stake in the oil rate case. His scheme to get control of the municipal government
so that he could still make himself necessary to the water company and the gas company
was defeated by the people. Herrin does not control a single member of the Board of
Supervisors. Of that much of his power he has been shorn, and the astute managers of
the water and the gas company are aware of it. They are also aware that the sale of the
Market-street Railway weakens Herrin's hold with that corporation. His only means of
retaining any of his former power and usefulness to the water and the gas corporation is
to hold fast to. his position as attorney for the Southern Pacific Railroad. That position,
however, is at this time about as precarious as is his position in the Market-street corpo
ration. Mr. Kruttschnitt, who has long been opposed to Herrin's use of the Southern
Pacific Company to serve the local corporations, is now in the East, and is pointing out
to the new management the wrong and the injury done to the company by Herrin's tac
tics. In the emphatic language of the street, he "is putting the knife into Herrin up to
the hilt." He is making no vague charges. The facts are on his side, and reason and
argument are on his side. Herrin cannot refute nor evade the charges urged against
him, and his only chance to retain his hold with the Southern Pacific Company is to win
this oil rate case and thus demonstrate that he controls the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners.
That is Herrin'? plight, and it is through the sacrifice of your reputation and your
career, Mr. Edson, that he hopes to win out. You know that he is now bringing to bear
upon you all the pressure he can exert to induce you to reverse your former decision
and refuse to lower oil rates. He has brought from all parts of the State men who pre
tend to be friends" of yours, to induce you to do this wrong to yourself and the State.
He cares nothing for you. He is fighting for his own hand. You are to do the dirty
work that he may reap the reward. ,
The evidence which Herrin has introduced at this hearing and by which he promises
to furnish you a soft cushion on Avhich to fall is of the kind known as "expert" tes
timony. Now all the world knows that expert testimony is given by professionals who
are employed and paid to give it. If you for Herrin's sake or for any other cause consent
to "fall down" on that testimony you will find that the softness is not that of a cushion,
but that of mud and mire.
We repeat.. Mr. Edson, that we give you this warning concerning the situation for
your own sake as well as for that of the people. If you decide as Herrin dictates the oil men
>vill lose nothing but money, but you will lose that good repute you have so long en
joyed. You will lose it for the sake of a desperate political schemer whose fortunes are
now so hazardous that not even your sacrifice can permanently secure them. It is for you
to decide whether you will fall with the Herrin or stand with the people.
If you have any hesitation in the matter, take 3. look at the political graveyard in
which the Southern Pacific Company has erected tombstones over those Railroad Commis
sioners who did its bidding.
Mr. Edson, the eyes of the people are' on you.
EDTJP-A.TIO3ST OF I3ST3DI-A.3STS.
JUDGING from the facts stated in the summary
given out of the annual report oi Indian Com
missioner William A. Jones the system of edu
cation which the Government has provided for In-**
dians is nearly all wrong and does more harm than
good. The criticism of the Commissioner is mainly
directed against the Indian boarding-schools, in which
the education is virtually the same as that given to
whites. He suggests that it would be better to pro
vide more day schools, giving in them a course of in
struction wjiich would teach the pupils the things
needed in Indian life, and particularly how to be self
supporting.
The Government is now maintaining 113 boarding
schools, in which it is educating or trying to edu
cate 16,000 Indians. The schools are excellent. The
young Indian who has been brought up in a tepee
or a mud lodge finds himself on arriving at the
school transplanted into a comfortable home, where
he is warmly clothed, well fed, provided with clean
beds and cared for by all the resources of civilization.
His linen is washed in a steam laundry,. his cooking
is done for him on a modern stove, he has hot and
cold baths, and he can get light or heat by merely
pressing a button. For his amusement and enter
tainment there are books, music, dancing, gymna
siums and athletic sports. He is taught grammar,
geography, history, drawing, algebra, astronomy,
botany and several other sciences. A careful matron
looks after his welfare while he is well and a doctor
attends him when he is sick. He is thus fitted for
civilized life, but at the same time he is unfitted for
any other kind.
When he has finished his education at the boarding
school and returns to his tribe the young graduate
enters a community where all his training is use
less. The white boy after leaving school finds him
self in a society that encourages him to make use of
all he has learned. Public sentiment sustains him at
the level of the school training. It stimulates him to
advance and improve vpon his education. The young
Indian finds in his tribe none of that encouragement
or support. He tries in vain to adapt the white train
ing to the Indian customs, and is compelled either to
abandon his race and go back to civilization or else
to throw the education aside and become like the
rest of his people. The tendency of this conflict be
tween education and tribal influence is to render the
young Indian sour and discontented, and it is only
persons m an exceptionally strong character who can
withstand the strain.
It is estimated that during the last thirty-three
years the Government has educated at its boarding
schools upward of 180,000 Indians at a cost of about
$250,000,000, but scarcely anything has been accom
plished. A large proeortion of the Indian popula

tion is still on the Government reservations, receiv
ing food froÂ» the Government and showing no signs
of ever becoming self-supporting. Commissioner
Jones says day schools and home teaching should
take the place of the boarding-schools. The young
Indian should be taught among the people with
whom he is to live, and should be impressed with the
importance of labor and thrift. "That there will be
many failures and much suffering," he says, "is in
evitable from the very nature of things, but it is only
by sacrifice and suffering that the heights of civili
zation are reached."
It is probable the report will call forth answers
from the advocates and beneficiaries of the present
system of Indian education, and until both sides are
heard final judgment is not to be pronounced, but
none the less all can recognize the sound common
sense of the arguments stated by the Commissioner.
A different system of education might not do much
better, but certainly it could hardly yield less in the
way of permanently good results.
A contested election case brought in Lackawanna
County, Pennsylvania, in 1897, over the office of
County Treasurer, has just been wound up by an
order of the Judge directing the County Commission
ers to pay all the costs involved in the contest. These
amount to nearly $90,000, and the tax-payers of the
county are wondering whether there isn't a better way
of settling such contests. The thing is the more irri
tating because the trial proved about an equal num
ber of fraudulent votes on each side and was so long
that the term of office expired before the case was
decided.
According to some of the New York papers the
testimonial given by Tammany to Croker after the
election was a jardiniere, while others say it was a
punch bowl, and it is significant of how little any of
them care about the man or the thing that not one
makes an effort to explain the contradiction or find
out the truth.
One of the neatest jobs Congressional leaders will
have to perform this session will be that of getting
Congressmen to agree upon a plan for revenue reduc
tion, or upon a policy of leaving things as they are.
Just at present each Congressman seems to think
that he has ideas of his own on the subject, and the
leaders will have to persuade him that he hasn't.
It is said the American missionaries in Bulgaria

SUPERVISORS CONSIDER AFFAIRS
OF PRIME IMPORTANCE TO CITY
SAYS SUPPLY
IS LESSENING
Reed Arraigns Spring
Valley Water Com
pany Again.
Board of Works to Report on
Availability of Lobos
Creek.
Supervisor Reed filed a communication
with the Board of Supervisors yesterday
to the effect that the water supply in the
reservoirs of the Spring Valley Company
was diminished one-third during the last
year, and that Point Lobos Creek is a
polluted source of supp y. The communi
cation was in reply to <he statement filed
by Chief Engineer Schussler that the
water was not contarrinated, and con
tains a general denial to Schussler's ai
guments. Reed says:
"The Spring Valley Water Works is a
'patchwork' system. No plan for the ex
tension of its works has been consistently
followed, but, on the contrary, its worka
have been enlarged on y under, the street,
of necessity, such as It faces now, whenjit
is driven to pump Point Lobos Creek
water and to spend millions of dolltfrs on
Alaraeda Creek."
Reed quotes from a report of Major
Owens, IT. S. A., to sK-w that thjÂ» water
is polluted. He demonstrates by figures
that there has been a net loss of 2,483,000,
00 gallons of water during the year in the
Pllarcitos, San Andreas and Crystal
Springs reservoirs, and claims that ot
that rate they will be empty in 1903.
The Board of Health was requested \o
furnish the board with analyses of sam
ples of water from Lobos Creek and
from the Golden Gate Park water works
system, and to furnish a report of the
number of cases of continued fever in the
district supplied by Lobos Creek. The
Board of Works was requested to report
on the availability oi the Lobos Creek
property as a uource ot water supply.
The resolution authorizing the appoint
ment of a janitor and the furnishing of
light to the rooms occupied by the Hast

lie with the Board of Works or the Super

Country Against Chinese.
Editor The Call: We are in favor of
Chinese exclusion. Do all you can to en
force the act and to prevent them taking
the place of white labor.
All around here are large fruit orchards.
Two right around us have been rented
to Chinese and two more are negotiating
to rent to Chinamen. Why, to think of it,
our School Clerk and Trustee hired a
Chinaman to repair and do carpentering
work for over two weeks on our district
school, while white men of large fami
lies would have been glad to get the work.
It Is wrong. We as taxpayers are paying
taxes to support such a class. Do they
pay taxes? No. Do they leave their
money around at stores? No. They just
ruin our fruit industry, for they neglect
the trees and get all the money they can
and they live like pigs around here. They
employ all kinds of people to Cut fruit
and no respectable woman or girl cares
to work in their sheds. Down with the

MUST SEPARATE
BOND ELECTIONS
City Attorney Says They
Cannot Be Held on
Same Day.
Bills for Improvements and
Utilities Are to Be
Revised.
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion yes
terday with the Board of Supervisors ad
vising that the ordinances concerning the
acquisition of public utilities cannot be
submitted at the same election as the
question of bonds for public improvs
ments. Lane says in his opinion:
Neither in my estimation can both of the
public utilities questions be submitted to
gether, but it seerris from section 7 ot Article
XII of the charter that each must be sub
mitted at a separate election embracing only
one utility. I have heretofore advised you tfcnl
the question of bonds for the various public
improvements contemplated, to wtt. : 9ew?r
system, parks, schoolhouses and hospitals
might be submitted at the same election, but
the question of public utilities has not been
heretofore presented. ThO3e proceedings arc
under a different section of the charter, and
that section requires submission of each at a
separate election*
Acquisition of Utilities.
The ordinances declaring that the pub
lic interest demands the acquisition of the
Geary-street road and its extensions, the
Tuolumne River water supply, the con
struction of a sewer system, a hospital
building, the construction of nineteen
schoolhouses. the acquisition of a site for
a new school building, additions to six
school buildings now constructed and
that lands contained in the block bounded
by Seventh. Folsom, Sherman and Har
rison streets; block bounded by Washing
ton, Gough, Sacramento and Lagun.-t
streets; blocks bounded by Dolores,
Church, Eighteenth and Twentieth streets
be acquired for park and playground pur
poses, and the block bounded by Hayes,
Grove, Larkin and Polk streets, which
were passed to print at the last meeting.
were re-referred to the Committee on Pub
lic Utilities and Judiciary, which will meet
on Wednesday and Friday afternoons for
the purpose of revising the ordinances in
accordance with the City Attorney's opin
ion that they were not legally drafted.
The opinion further says:
One of the bills states that the plans re
ferred to therein for furnishing water from
the Tuolumne River "are the ones to be sub
mitted to the people for their approval." I
assume that there is but one general plan, and
that no question of presenting to the voters
various alternatives is contemplated. In caso
this assumption is not correct kindly advise
me. as the proposition whether several altt:-
native plans may be so presented is one io
serving of careful consideration and ia not to
be passed upon offhand at this time. For theso
reasons I believe it would be advisable to pro
ceed no further under this bill.
Street Railroad System.
Bill Xo. 508 deals with municipal street rail
road systems. It recites tha^ "the plans and es
timates of th? costs of reconstructing the
Oeary-steet railroad and constructing the ex
tentions thereof as planned by the City En
gineer, with the exception of unessential
changes in the route suggested, are hereby se
lected a3 the ones to be submitted to. the peo
ple for their approval." In the report of the
City Engineer there are six different "pro
jects" separately and distinctly set forth With
a separate estimate for each, the estimates
of a different scheme varying as much as
$700,000. The bill does not atate which of these
six is the one selected. If it was your inten
tion not to select one, but to submit all, I!
possible, to the electors, I make the same sug
gestion as just made regarding the water works
bill, namely, that the matter be submitted to
me for full consideration whether such a course
is possible. My present Inclination is towerd
the belief that such a, cpurse not being dis
tinctly warranted by tHe charier, would be un
safe. If but one plan is â¢ be submitted, it
would be advisable to designate that one in
the bill.
I would also suggest that if by the language
"the Geary-street Railroad and the extensions
thereof as planned by the City Engineer" ynu
mean one of the six entire projects set fot th
in the report mentioned. It would be advisable
to use more comprehensive lar.aruaee. inas
much a3 the railroads planned comprise 15. S4
miles of track, while the Geary-street road
extends some 3 1-3 miles only, the balance be
ing new road. ' and moreover not properly
termed "extensions" of that road, as it in
cludes a route from the Presidio to the Potrero
at right angles to the Geary-street system. For
the reasons mentioned I consider this bill In
formal and insufficient.
For New Schoolhouses.
In the bill providing fcr the acquisition of
new schoolhouses the estimates provide for at
least six new lots of land for school purposes,
while the bill mentions but one. And speak
ing generally of the proposed new school
houses and new school lots it seems to me that
It would be wise to set out at length In the bill
the several schools (known now by familiar
names) for which It is desired to build new
structures, and in the instances of new schools
on lots to be purchased the general district
tn which they are to be located, likewise the
lanies of the school buildings to be added to
or repaired.
It appears from the foregoing that neither
of the public utilities measures nor those con
cerned with improvements generally are hi a
condition to proceed at the present time.

The Board of Works filed communica

the properties the city must acquire to
carry out the Telegriph Hill improve

SIERRA AND DORIC END EXCITING
RACE FROM THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
Coming Here From*Australa and the Orient They Meet at Honolulu.
Masters Assert There Was No Speed Contest, but Winner
Torched the Record When She Made Port Ahead of Her Rival
BRITISH BARK FERNBANK IN TROUBLE. THE TIE OF THE MAIN TOPGALLANT YARD BROKE AND IN
ITS FALL CARRIED AWAY THE LIFTS AND PARRAL, SMASHING THE ROYAL YARD IN TWO AND
TEARING THE SAIL INTO RIBBONS.
THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Sierra and the Occidental and
Oriental Steamship Company's
Doric made port yesterday. The
Doric had about an hour's start,
but failed to reach port before sundown,
while the Sierra at that hour was along
side the wharf and her mail was being
rushed ashore in time to catch the over
iand.
The Doric and Sierra lay alongside each
other in Honolulu. Neither captain said
a word about a race, but every maYi on
the ships knew that when the llr.es wore
cast off there was going to be some hus
tling in the engine-room. Last night
there was no means of securing an of
ficial statement of the sailing hours, as
the Doric, being the first vessel to sail,
brought the papers and newspaper mail.
An hour after sailing the Doric was
hull down on the horizon and about ihat
time the Sierra started out on her stern
chase. The captain of the Sierra saw his
opponent leave amid a flourish of trum
pets and blew him three whistles a.= a
good-by. Yesterday he stood on the
bridge as his vessel lay alongside the
wharf and received the news that the
Doric was "passing in." The latter ves
sel was scheduled to arrive this morning,
but as usual got in a day ahead of time.
The Sierra was scheduled to arrive yes
terday morning, but was delayed between
Sydney and Pago Pago by heavy
weather, but made up her time by mak
ing the run between Honolulu and Pan
Francisco in live days and twelve hours.
By making: time in this manner the Eng
lish mail will easily reach New York on
Saturday in time to catch the Campania.

The purser of the Sierra reports the
death of United States Consul Osborne at
Apia on October 27. He had been suffer
ing from a complication of diseases for
many months. The natives attended the
funeral ceremonies in great numbers and
the German authorities paid all possible
respect to the memory of the deceased.
The tody was enbalmed and â¢will probably
be brought home on the United States
battleship Wisconsin.
The United States ships Wisconsin. So
lace and Abarenda were in port at Pago
Pago when the SiÂ«=rra arrived.
The Sierra ran into a heavy gale soon
after leaving Sydney, N. S. W., and was
hove to for several hours.
BARK FERNBANK IN TROUBLE.
ITet With a Very Peculiar Accident
Off Australian Coast.
The British bark Fernbank, which ar
rived from Australia yesterday, met with
a most peculiar accident when a few days
out The captain sa^d yesterday when
talking about the affair:
Four days after leaving Newcastle, N. P. W.,
the tie of the main topgallant mast carried
away and the yard fell. The force of the fall
carried away the lifts and parral (the iron
hook which eoes around the mast and to which
the yard is attached). The royal yard was
pmafhed in two and the sail torn into ribbons.
It was the most peculiar and unforeseen acci
dent I have ever come across in all my life
at Â»ea. Th<re was practically no wind at the
time, and why the tie should part Just at that
I articular time is a mystery. It's lucky there
waun't a gale blowing.
The Fernbank had fine weather to the
equator and then had baffling winds for
ten days. To the vicinity of Hawaii she
had good breezes, but once north of San
Francisco she met the southeaster that
has been raging and had a hard time to
port. The Fernbank is chartered to load
wheat for Europe.
Steamship Doric Arrives.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Doric arrived from the Orient
last evening. She failed to make port
before sundown so the Quarantine Officer
did not board her and her passenger* had
to remain aboard all night. She brings
no passengers from the islands, but has
considerable correspondence and news
paper matter that business men are now
wishing was aboard the Sierra.
City of Sydney Arrives.
The Hail Company's City of Sydney ar
rived from Panama and way ports yester
day morning. The Compania Sud Amer
icana de Vapores' Paiena left the isthmus
an hour after the Sydney, but she got in
Sunday morning. Captain McLean ex
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1901.
plains the difference in time by saying
that the Mail Company will not allow the
vessel to run beyond a certain speed.
Those who came up on the Sydney were:
William A. Holbeck, Trinidad de Annio,
Julius H. Ellis, Ercelia Montalvo and Otto
Frese.
Besides these she brought seven up in
the steerage. Her cargo consisted of fish,
coffee, fruit, indiarubber and indigo and
$87,578 in treasure, consigned to San
Francisco banks.
Troubles of the Alexander.
It was stated in this paper several days
ago that the schooner Alexander left here
in tow of the steamer National City with
a partial crew and not fully provisioned.
The supposition being that the vessel on
her arrival at the port of lading would re
ceive her full complement. The facts of
the matter are that the Alexander left
here with a full crew and was provisioned
for seven months. When off her port
of destination the captain of the National
City would not take the schooner in,
claiming the bar was dangerous, so the
Alexander had to anchor outside, while
the National City passed in. During tho
night a gale sprang up and the Alexander
was blown out to sea. Since that time she
has not been heard from. She was well
found, however, and will probably show
up again in a day or so.

SUPREME COURT
ENDS DISPUTE
Hattie Trundle's Heirs
Lose* Bequest of
Thousands.
Their Procrastination Proves
of Value to Sutro '
Estate.
By a decision of the Supreme Court
rendered yesterday the heirs of Hattle A.
Trundle cannot collect the $50,000 which
v,-as bequeathed to her by Adolph Sutro.
It Ir held that the claim should have been
presented when the will of the million
â¢aire was offered for probate, and that
while the demand is undoubtedly a just
one it cannot be supported by law.
In July, 1879, at Virginia City, Nev., Su
tro and his wife assaulted Hattie Trundle.
It is alleged in the complaint that .she
was brutally beaten and that her assail
ants called her scandalous names before
numerous witnesses. She notified the Su
tros that she would bring suit for dam
ages. They asked her to refrain from go
ing to law and stipulated that if she
v/ould do so they would make ample rep
aration. It is stated that after numerous
consultations she was prevailed upon to
forego the suit and accept $50,000 for her
physical and mental anguish.
The money did not materialize and- Su
tro promised tnat the agreement should
be fulfilled in time. True to his promise,
he made a $50,000 bequest to Mrs. Trundle
in his wili, stating the reason for whlcli
it was given. The will was offered for
probate, but Mrs. Trundle failed to pre
sent her claim. She died, intestate and
her heirs brought, suit against Emma L.
Merritt and W. R. H. Adamson, who were
chosen to execute the provisions of the
will of Adolph Sutro.
The stilt is based on the alleged con
tract which existed between the Sutros
and Mrs. Trundle. According to the stat
utes, such a contract becomes outlawed
at the end of two years, exclusive of the
time of non-residence. The Supreme
Court holds that the suit cannot be main
tained upon an obligation which has been
extinguished as this was, legally, by the
bequest.
The settlement, if there is to be oni,
must be in the Probate Court. Since the
claim tv&s not presented at the proper
time,. it seems likely therefore that Mrs..
Trundle's heirs will have to exist with
out that $50,000.

WARM PRAISE
FOR HARRIMAN
Banker Mills Commends
Southern Pacific
President.
Oregon Capitalist Says His
Regime Will Benefit
California.
A. L. Mills, banker, of Portland, Or.,
and a director of the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company, is in town and is
staying at the Palace. He Is here on
pleasure and yesterday arrived from Del
Monte, accompanied by his wife.
Although the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company is controlled by
Harriman, Mr. Mills does not know the
railway magnate. The company was or
ganized under the laws of Oregon and
eight of the fifteen directors live in Port
land, the rest being residents of New-
York City.
Mr. Mills thinks Harriman will make a
good president of the Southern Pacific
Company and help California. He said:
With Harriman as president oÂ£ the company
we can look for great improvements. Most
people are afraid of railroads and yet when
they come to consider there are laws and Leg
islatures to protect the public and see that it
is not imposed upon by unjust rates.
Consolidations are also good for the people.
When there are railroad wars the people in
the end are the losers. An example of thts is
furnished by the Standard Oil Company. Thi3
corporation controls nearly the entire oil in
dustry and yet it flnd3 that with low rates it
doe 3 more business and gets larger returns
than by trying to impose on the public.
One thins more that possibly the general pub
lic is not aware of Is that there is no Oregon
Railroad and Navigation stock on tha market.
All the shares are owned by the- Union Pacific
Company, with a few exceptions. Some time
ago the Union Pacific went Into the market
and bought up all the available stock.
Director Mills leaves to-morrow for
Portland. He is delighted with Cali
fornia.
CORPORATIONS ORDERED
TO ISSUE CERTIFICATES
Judge Hebbard Decides That Dupli
cates Must Be Made of Lost
Papers.
Judge Hebbard rendered a decision yes
terday in the suit instituted by Mary S.
Homer and P. Boland, as administrator
of the estate of Eliza M. Wilson, against
the Spring Valley Water Works and the
Pacific Gas Improvement Company- to
compel the corporations to issue duplicate
certificates of stock, the originals of
which, the plaintiffs claimed, /Mra. Wil
son had lost.
The corporations demurred to the com
plaint on the ground that they were no:
allowed to issue the -jertificates, because
they had no proof that the originals had
been lost. Judge Hebbard holds that the
companies must issue the stock, and dis
poses of the claim made by the corpora
tions that if the originals at any time in
the future appeared an overissue of stock
would result.
Charges Against Policemen.
Charges have been preferred by Captain
Spillane before the Police Commissioners
against Policemen Nicholas J. Barry and
Richard H. Beamer. Barry is accused of
being absent from his beat for two hours
on the night of November 19, which, it
is alleged, he spent in the .vhite Star
laundry, 385 Eighth street. Beamer is also
charged with being absent, the time be
ing fifty minutes, which, it is alleged, he
also spent in the same laundry and was
found asleep there by the sergeant. Lieu
tenant Birdsall has also preferred a
charge against Policeman Robert Lean
for unofÃcerllke conduct in using abusive
language and wanting to fight W. Bar
rett, a conductor on the Geary-street line,
on the night of November 10.
Miss Adams Was Romancing.
Edward Lee, the young man who was
arrested Sunday night on a charge of rob
bery for stealing a silver ring valued at
$1 from Marie Adams, a girl 17 years of
age. appeared before Judge Mogan yes
terday. A.fter hearing the girl's story,
who said she did not want to prosecute
Lee, as he was her friend, the Judge dis
missed the case. The girl's mother, who
lives at 609 Post street, was in court and
said her daughter was inc/lned to be way
ward and tell romantic stories, and asked
that she be sent to the Magdalen Asylum.
The Judge ordered the girl into custody
and will nrobably send her to the insti
tution to-day.

Fruits and Salmon in England.
The London Grocers' Gazette of November 9
says: 'In spite of the attention necessarily
devoted to the fruit trade at this season of
the year salmon is getting a fair share of
business just now and Alaska on the spot must
be quoted firmer on the week, nothing now
beint obtainable except at about bd above the
lowest prices recently ruling. Shipments from
San Francisco are later than usual this sea
eon and this will give the trade here an op
portunity of moving off their holdings before
ihe arrival ot the IWII pack. Fraser River
fc&.mun is steady, with tair business doing.
7ne Lake Chajuplain has arrived at Liverpool
with VuiKS cases from Montreal. There has been
some inquiry this week for California fruits,
but no great improvement in tne volume of
business can be reported."
Dried Fruits in New York.
Mail advices from New York say: "The local
currant Eiitfaticn was still stronger yesterday,
the Guildhall with further supplies not having
arrived. The market was held exceedingly still
at 6%c for Amalias in barrels, with inquiries
lor a number of lound lots irom out-of-town
buyers at 6c The present price is due en
tirely to the Guildhall's delay and the scarcity
and close control of spot supplies. In the event
01 further delay in tne arrival of the steamer
the price is almost certain to go higher. Cur
rants per Guildhall offer from 6@6%c. accord

continues extremely active and cleaners have
more than they can do.

mostly at a -c basis on the coast, though some
small sizes are still offered at %c less. Cali

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, ' Nov. 25.â From general
strength during the, early part of the day the
stock market gave way â¢Â¦ to general weakness
before the close and ended under active sell
ing pressure with only such recoveries as were
due to the early taking of profits on the short
side by the bears. It .was notable in -the 'early
strength that many stocks responded very mou
erately to the buoyant rise in the leaders. Th>
general break at .the, last was . effective
throughout the list, but it left the leaders of
the advance with considerable net gains to
show. The trunk lines were early leaders of
the advance, ; especially New York Central,
which added 4% to its recent remarkable ad
vance. No news was offered to explain the
advance, beyond the many rumors long- preva
lent of a Vanderbilt deal. The . movement .in
Pennsylvania was clearly a supplement to that
in New York Central, and was in the hands
of professional speculators, who saw the force
of an argument for the maintenance of an ap
proximate ratio between the two stocks. Penn
sylvania's extreme advance was 3%. The late
reaction left a net gain for New York Cen
tral of 4% and for Pennsylvania 1%. The rise
in New York Central carried with it the junior
Vanderbilts to the extent of from 1% to 10
points, the latter figure for Michigan Centra..
There was enormous buying of the Readings
and of the Southern Railway stocks, but their
advance never much exceeded a point. A fac
tor in the opening strength was the scramble
on the part of the bears who went short cf
Amalgamated Copper en Saturday on the re
port, denied after the . market closed, that the
Attorney General of the United States was pre
paring a case against the company under the
anti-trust law. The opening rush carried the
stock 1% over Saturday's closing level and i
this proved the highest point of the day. The
indisposition of the stock to rally further in
vited renewed attack,- and the final slump to
below SO was the principal unsettling factor
of the general list. The stock touched 79% and
closed at 80. l The heaviness of the transconti
nental stocks was a feature of .the trading
throughout. Speculators are apparently indis
posed to pay higher prices for these stocks un
til , the result is disclosed of the agitation in
the Northwestern States against, the Northern
Securities Company. There was an upward
spurt of 2% in St. Paul, which seemed to be
manipulated by the bull leaders under a reali
zation of the depressing effect of the heavi
ness in that group. There was more or less
realizing in stocks - which have recently ad
vanced under cover of the early strength in
the leaders, but it was not more than is usual
in the progress of a bull market.
There was no change in the . conditions in
the money market. Foreign ' exchange con
tinued to drop away from the gold-export
point. . '
Except for the. strongest stocks, the weak
closing of the market left the losses . predomi
nating, running to a point or over in some
cases. â¢
Railroad bends were firm. Total sales, J3,
â¢365.000.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â The foreign markets . continued
firm, with higher futures at Paris and Liver
pool. The English visible supply Increased
966, C00 bushels. The world's shipments for the
week were as follows, in quarters: Russian,
26,000; Danubian, 55,000; Argentine, 11,000.
Chicago ruled firm, though quotations showed
little fluctuation. The strength was unabated
in all markets and the Increase in the specu
lative demand counteracts the large accumula
tion. The visible supply continues to show a
large increase, that for last week being 3,235,
00 bushels. Offerings, however, were light and
there was good general buying. Commission,
houses were large purchasers and the Corn
crowd bought Wheat. It was rumored that
France was buying cash at New York and fu
tures at Chicago. Cash Wheat was stiff at St.
Louis and readily taken by millers and export
ers. The Kansas S^ate Board made the crop
of that State 90,045,000 bushels, valued at $60,
479,000, or 13,450,000 bushels more than last year.
The Government report places the Kansas crop
at 96,000,000 bushels. Minneapolis reported a
heavy demand for Flour.

more than it is to-day, as the crop was light
and stocks of fresh fruit are small.

Innocence.
Chief of Police Wittman has. declared
war upon the Email fry gam/lers and
others who are doing an Illegal and illegi
timate trade Gelling pools upon horse races
in cigar stores and other convenient
places-. Details of officers were sent out
yesterday and the proprietors of the
yiores were notified that they must prove
" Ci-eir intent to observe the law.
In some instances officers were detailed
in front of places to which no suspicion
attached* So soon as the proprietors gave
their axsxir-ance that they were not en
pgred in the business of selling pools on
horse- races the surveillance was with
drawn-. Many who did not understand
the object of the order of the Chief of
Police made complaint, but were soon
satisfied that the order was made in the
interest. of the legitimate line of trade.
Chief Wittman is evidently determined
to enforce the law as it is laid down in
the statute books and In the ordinances of
the Board of Supervisors. Reports had
been made to him that pools on horse
races were being indiscriminately sold in
the city. Cigar stores were said to be the
mediums through which the bettor could
back his judgment against a field of
horses and "cash in" after the race was
run. That there was no general violation
of the law was easily proved.
Men were detailed :n front of many
cigar stores, and with book in hand took
the names of customers. So soon as com
plaints Â¦were made to him about this
method of procedure Chr?f Wlttman. upon

EWTTCHMEN DECIDE
TO GO OUT ON STRIKE
Employes of Seven Large Railroads
Will Hot Report for Work
This Morning.
PrTTSBUUG, Pa.. Nov. 25.â The
switchmen on seven railroads of Pitts
burg have decided to strike at 6 o'clock
to-morrow morning. At a meeting of the
Brotherhood of Switchmen to-nignt
Â¦which was attended by about 600 mem
bers this action was decided upon, and
the result of this meeting can only be
conjectured. In anticipation of possible
trouble it is learned that the Pennsylva
nia Railroad has made application to the
city for sixty officers to be on hand in
the union station yards at 6 o'clock to
morrow morning and in the Baltimore
and Ohio yards fully 100 Pinkerton men
are on duty to-night.
The claim made at the switchmen's
meeting to-night was that 700 to 1000 men
would obey the strike order in the morn
ing. The mate was that in the union
station yards of the Pennsylvania 138
men would go out; that the yards at Pit
cairn and Wall would go out in the same
proportion: that the Baltimore and Ohio
and the Pittsburg and Lake Erie yards
would go out solidly, and that the Mo
r.ongahela, Pittsburg and Virginia and
Charleston, the Shoenberger Terminal
and the Pittsburg and Western would be
practically Â¦without men.- It "was also
claimed that the Fort Wayne and Pan
handle men would lend a helping hand.
The demand of the men is that the Chi
cago rate be paid here. This rate is 27
cents an hour for day conductors and 29
cents for night conductors of switch en
gines; helpers 25 cents day and 27 cents
night. The Pittsburg rate at' present is
25 cents for day and 26 cents for night
conductors; 19 cents for day and 20

BLANCHE PARTINGTON
IN spite of the keen disappointment
caused by Mme. Eames' non-appear
ance last night at the Grand Opera
house, the house that greeted Mme.
Seygard, who substituted for the
missing singer, was a courteous and
kindly one. It has been Mme. Seygard's
ill-fortune to be called upon twice during
the season to substitute for the chief
singers in a cast. Calve in one instance
and last night Eames as Marguerite, on
shortest notice. As understudy of both
she is, of course, familiar with the roles,
as her work in "Faust" amply evidenced",
but it is a more or icss thankless task
at the best and she deserves all the credit
there Is in it. Mme. Seygard is by much
a better Marguerite than she is a Carmen,
although her vocal defectsâ the voice is
badly produced, throaty, though not lack
ing in native beautyâ debar her from dis
tinction. The audience good-naturedly
encored the "Jewel Song" that was pret
tily sung in a light, undramatic fashion
and throughout was kindly inclined to the
ri II tt n tfe e acting rhaPS ' sensibly - she attempts
Salignac was cast for Fnust, but fits
the role only 'ndiffereatly well. His least
engaging vocal characteristics, the vibra
to and nasal tone quai'ty, are most cv!-
Cent in the sustained phrases of the part
and there is but slight opportunity for the
kind of thing Salignac does best. His
work was almost entirely without thrill,
fiber or point, though he filled out a few
climaxes with his customary spirit. De
Reszke pulled things 'lOgether nobly so
long as he was on the stage. He was in
excellent form, and his Mephistopheles is
worth going far to hear and see. He is
always so easily satisfying that one rare
ly stops to think how wonderful his art
really is. It all sounds so absurdly easy.
Campanari was again the Valentine, and
satisfied all requirements of the roie
Mme. Homer charmed as Siebel, and Miss
Bauermeister was again the quaintly
comic figure of Marta, to the advantage
of the cast.
The orchestra was in splendid trim un
der Mr. Seppilli's distinguished guidance,
grid the choral matters were in good
shape. "The Soldiers' Chorus" aroused
i*s customary enthusiasm and was repeat
ed.
"Die Walkure" is to-night's bill.
Tivoli.
The warm air, the purple vine?, the
sunny skies and the unwritten poetry of
the land of the chrysanthemum appeal to
our love of the romantic and awaken our
sensibilities with the warm glow of a
tropic dawn. This is one of the reasons
why "The Geisha" is so popular with the
music-loving part of the community. The
opera is given a greater charm this week
at the Tivoli by the Pollard Australian
Juvenile Company. The almost rigorous
correctness of the costuming and scening
of the piece is a matter for both delight
and surprise. The little people had play
ed "The Geisha" long before their feet had
pressed the sacred soil of the land of the
Mikado, but not until they had mingled
with that remarkable people did they
realize the fact that there was something
wrong somewhere with the stage idea of
the kimono. The old costumes were at
once cast aside and new ones were order
ed, the handiwork of the best tailors in
Japan, and the scenery and stage settings
were designed, painted and Arranged by
Japanese artists, so that "The Geisha" at
the Tivoli is a real peep into the fairyland
of the gentle, hospitable and courteous
people who wear the topknot at home and
tne plug hat of civilization abroad.
That witching little elf. Miss Woodson,
the Mollie Seymour of the cast, bubbles
over with fun and resembles for all the
world a big Christmas doll just come to
life and pitched upon the stage. She and
Daphne Pollard, the little Tommy Stanley
of the cast, are the smallest, youngest
and most admired of the whole troupe.
They are too small to sing, but they act
as if born to the footlights with three
generations of heredity behind them.
Master Willie Pollard's Wun Hi is a
somewhat different Wun from that of
Ferris Hartman, but it is just as funnyâ
"same place ev'ly time." Alice Pollard,
Mimosa San, is pretty and graceful and
sings better than most girls of her age.
She is frequently encored and bears her
honors modestly. â¢ Ivy Pollard does the
role of Reginald Fairfax very acceptably
and received several recalls for her solos,
although she was not in the best of vocal
trim last evening. Minnie Topping's Lady
Constance Wynne and Connie Pollard's
Juliette Diamante are equally acceptable
in their less assuming characters. The
star comedy character of the opera is the
Marquis Imara. the amorous chief of po
lice, and is well presented by Harold Hill.
"The Geisha" is a treat this week and
should not be overlooked.
Alcazar.
The popular military play "We 'Uns of
Tennessee" was presented at the Alcazar
Theater last night with a powerful cast.
The house was well filled and the audi
ence showed by repeated curtain calls
how keenly it appreciated the patriotic
sentiments expressed m the play and the
able manner in which the capable stock
company presented it. There is something
peculiarly attractive in the lines, and the
touches of pathos and humor are nicely
blended. Howard Scott was excellent as
Hiram Gray, the Sheriff of Jemm County,
and Charles F. Bryant did splendid work
as Lige Monroe, the mountaineer. He
fully deserved the unstinted applause ac
corded him. M. L. Alsop was a manly
Jack Gray, and Henry Shumer was in his
element as Sidney Gny, the young lku
tenant. Mr. Bernard made a hit as
Colonel Pool, and Frank Baker did a

clever piece of character work as Scank

made a capable villain. Miss Marion
Convere as Lucile Courtney was charm
ing and effective, and Miss Oza Waldrop
carried the house with her as Sapho
Champs. The scene where she wades the
creek was finely executed, and the arcn
ness and ingenuousness displayed were
something to be remembered. Miss Julie 1 :
Crosby met with an enthusiastic recep
tion and played the pa: I of Mand-y Moore
with rare, tact and ability. Miss Margaret
Wycherley made a t-ewitching widow
and Miss Marie Howe did well as Aunt
Lilly. All the other characters were well
sustained- The piece Is splendidly staged.
Orpheum.
"La Belle Tortajada ' is easily the
bright particular star at the Orpheum
this week, and Jier Spanish songs and
dances are creating *> bensation. She <s
said to have broken many mascuiln-;
hearts in Granada, and she is handsome
enough to repeat the operation here. She
not only dances with vie very poetry of
motion, but possesses a beautiful voice,
which she uses to advantage in severii
selections, principal urnong them being
"La Paloma," which fhe sings with a
dash and vivacity that are all her own.
Andy Lewis in "The Cocaine Fiend" is
among the newcomers, and creates much
amusement with the delineation of a
character that is evidently true to life.

picture of colored effects, the one entitled
SUICIDE OF PROJECTOR
OF THE CHICAGO FAIR
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.â Lying against
the shore at Mount Vernon, with his coat
pockets filled with stones ; the body of
Alexander D. Anderson, a well-known
Washington lawyer and commissioner to
the Chicago World's Fair, was found to
day. Anderson left a note for his family
Sunday morning biddirÂ«r them adieu, say
ing he was going to end his suffering of
many years from stomach trouble. He
was 58 years old, a native of Mansfield,
Cpnn. ; a graduate of Yale and of the Ann
Arbor School of Law, Assistant District
Attorney of St. Louis under General
Noble and special commissioner of the
Pan-American markets for the New Or-
"The Garlands" beins highly spectacular.
Goleman's trained dogs and cats are r.n
interesting feature, and the canines and
felines are made to do some remarkab.e
tricks. Among the h< Id-overs the Kauf
mann family in their bicycle act are st'll
received with favor. When one considers
how difficult it is to learn to ride the ma
chine the stunts performed by one of the
younger members are positively marvel
ous. Lillian Burkhart repeats her former
success in the playlet "The Passing Fan
cy." Blcknell, the clay modeler, and
Ward and Curran round out a good pro
gramme.
California.
Knute Erickscn's very clever imper
sonation of Yon Yons.ui greatly pleased
a large audience at the California last
night. His rendition of negro melodies
in his broad Swedish dialect is one of the
best things in the show, and his skill with
stringed instruments earns him very
hearty applause. His support is very
good. Judging from the reception "Yon
Yonson" has met with at the first two
performances a successful week is as
sured.
"A Stranger In a Strange Land" follow*
at the California, opening Sunday night.
This is the brilliant farce comedy that
made such a hit here last year, and which
returns this time witn the original com
pany intact. It is one of the best farces
of Fecent years.
Columbia.
"On the Quiet." with William Collier
in the leading role, is now on its second
week's run at the Columbia. The cleverly
written comedy gives the droll wit of Col
lier ample leeway, and some of the situa
tions are extremely amusing. In addition
to its merits in this respect it may be said
that the various jpcenic effects are excep
tionally beautiful and well arranged. In
the third act the yacht scene is quite
realistic and one of the best of its kind
ever seen here. Collier is well supported
in his new mirth-producer by Cranley
Douglass and Mr. Heckarts. The play
was written especially for Mr. Collier's
peculiar comedy genius by Augustus
Thomas, and it is one of the several really
clever things that have sprung from the
pen of the noted playwright.
Central.
The horrors of prison life in the penal
colonies of Asiatic Russia and the excite
ment attendant upon Nihilistic intrigue,
its discovery and ultimate success ar<=
faithfully portrayed :n "Siberia" at the
Central Theater. The initial performance
of this thrilling melochama was greeted
with a crowded house and frequently re
curring applause. Annette Marshall as
the heroine was the favorite of the audi
ence. James Corrigan In a humorous part
evoked continued laughter. Hallett
Thompson, the hero, and Stanley Rosa,
the villain, were also frequently applaud
ed. The play if an excellent one of its
kind tnd will undoubtedly meet with well
deserved success.
Chutes.
The Chutes has an excellent bill this
week. Sharon and Mcrritt, illusionists,
present an entertaining act, including the
famous handcuff tricks introduced here
by the great Houdlni. Rose Andrew and
Mabel Male are clevei singers and dane
leans Exposition. Anderson was credited
with being the real projector of the Chi
cago World's Fair.

employed a number of startling electrical
effects. Maud Treadwell gave a pleasing

TRIAL ON BRIBERY CHARGE
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.â A hearing
was begun to-day at the Department of
Justice in the case of Judge Webster
Street, Chief Justice of the Third District
of the Ninth Judicial District of Arizona,
against whom a number of charges have
been filed, including bribery, corruption
and improper judicial conduct in several
specified cases. Attorney General Knox
and Assistant Attorney General Hoyt con
ducted the hearing, which was held in pri
vate. Until the conclusion is reached no
authoritative statement will be made. All
the parties in interest, eight or ten in
number, were present to-day.
p*Tf=C HERE was deep disappointment
I at the Grand Opera-house last
night, when glaring bills an
il nounced that Mme. Emma Eames
was In the hands of her physicians
and would not sing the role of Marguerite
in "Faust."
On the previous evening the prima don
na sent Manager Grau a dainty note in
forming him that she was feeling in the
best of health and would surely be able
to appear last night.
The diva, however, arose yesterday
morning with a touch of huskiness in her
throat and a desire to cough, and mes
sengers were sent to call Drs. Herzsteln
and Selfridge. The medicos examined the
throat and chest of Mmc Eames and the
letter they sent to Manager Grau upset
all plans for the gala evening at the
opera.
The billboards in the lobby of the Grand
Opera-house reproduced in big type the
verdict of the medicos and the crowd
that gathered last night read that Mme.
Eames was suffering from inflamed vocal
chords and irritation of the trachea and
bronchial tubes and could not appear.
Mme. Camille Seygard bravely undertook
the role of Marguerite at short notice,
and, with her talented associates, Salig
nac, De Reszke, Campanari, Bauermeister
and Bridewell, gave a spirited perform
ance of Gounod's opera.
The theater was about half filled and
dozens who intended witnessing the
opera with Mme. Eames in the role of
Marguerite changed their minds and re
turned home.
During the first act Manager Grau re
ceived the following letter from Mme.
Eames:
Dear Mr. Grau: As sorry as I am for myself.
I am a thousand times sorrier for you. I g-ot.

though ray voice sounded clear and fresh 1
could not sing a minute without an aw?ul
desire to cough. It is nearly the same when
I speak, so I shall continue to-day to write
all I have to say, as I have done these last
days. My chords are still red, which makes it,
of course. Impossible for me to singr.
Try and not hate me. for you must know
how I want to, and how I appreciate all the
troubles you have had and with what regret
I add to those you already have had to bear
with colds, etc. Ever your affecttonate friend,
EMMA EAMES-STORY.
But for the unfortunate indisposition
that has affected Eames, Calve and San
derson the grand opera season would have
broken all records. That the public sym
pathizes with Manager Gra^u is felt on
all sides and brave hopes are expressed
that his delicate songbirds will quickly
recover and allow the management to
carry out its plans for this and next
week.
To-night "Die 'Walkure" will be repeat

sale of seats assures a crowded house.

CAPTAIN TILLEY
GAINS A POINT
Accused Officer Faces
Court- Martial in
Tutuila.
Charges of Mai-Administra
tion Are Eliminated by
Admiral Casey.
TUTUILiA, Nov. 25.â 0n the morning at
November 5 the U. S. S. Wisconsin ar
rived in the harbor. It was announced
that Admiral Casey had been ordered to
Pagopago to convene a court-martial to
try Captain B. F. Tilley, the commandant
of the station. The news was received
with great surprise by the Samoan peo
ple. They had been making extensive
preparations during the past month to
welcome Captain Tilley on his return.
On November 6 the Sonoma arrived with
Captain Tilley and Mrs. Tilley on board.
The Samonans of Pagopago had built a
huge catamaran of native trees, upon
which was a bower decorated with ever
greens and flowers. Flags and streamers
were flying from the masts. They ap
proached tne steamer with this immense
raft and Captain and Mrs. Tilley de
scended to it and were pulled ashore, while
songs of welcome were sung. Upon land
ing at the Custom-house there was a
large crowd to meet the captain, who
was loudly cheered by whites and na
tives.
The United States steamer Solace ar
rived on November 7 with Admiral Evan*
and the other officers of the court-mar
tial. The Aberanda, which had been dis
patched to Apia to bring witnesses for
the prosecution, returned the dame day.
Shortly after the arrival of the Solaco
it was definitely announced that the
charges against Captain Tilley, which had
been prepared in Washington, would b<s
served on him at once. At 6 o'clock of
the same day Captain Tilley was formal
ly served with a copy of the charges and
specifications and was ordered to deliver
up his sword.
The trial of Captain Tilley began on
Saturday, November 9. The most im
portant witness was Dr. Blackwell. He
testified that about 10:30 o'clock one
night, and on toward midnight, he saw
Captain Tilley lying down outside his
cabin door undergoing a Samoan mas
sage treatment. This treatment is very
common here with whites as well as na
tive chiefs. T^ie prosecution closed itÂ»
case on Monday, November H, rather
earlier than was expected. On Tuesday
the defense began, the chief witness being
Lieutenant Ricnardson of the Abarenda
and Judge Gurr. The trial is expected to
close to-morrow. From late information
it appears that Admiral Casey, after due
investigation dropped the charge of
mal-administration against Captain Til
ley.
On November 8 representatives from all
Tutuila gathered in Pagopago to wel
come Admiral Casey and give him the
highest tribute a Samoan can offer to a
distinguished visitor. It was a large
"taalolo." symbolical of allegiance to
United States Government. The tribes
passed by the admiral, who was accom
panied by all the leading officers of the
ships, and presented their offerings of
submission. Native Governor Mauga.
made the speech of welcome. It told of
the contented condition of the people un
der the present government and spoke in
the highest terms of Commandant Tilley.
Upon receipt of the official Information
of the death of President McKlnley. a
memorial service was held at Pagopago.
Lieutenant Jayne, U. S. N., commanding
the station, sent invitations to all the rep
resentative heads of the missionary so
cieties in Tutuila and a most sympathetic
response was made. At the special ser
vice the Rev. Mr. Hawker of the London
Mission Society preached an impressive
sermon and Judge Gurr read the les
sons. The service was attended by the
officers of the U. S. S. Abarenda in full
dress and by many men from, the same
vessel.

OIL RATE CASE
IS CONTINUED
General Manager Nevin
of Santa Fe Road
Testifies.
Declares That There Is No
Great Profit in Petro
leum.
Before Railroad Commissioners Edson,
Blackstock and Laumeister the rehearing
of the oil rate case was continued yester
day afternpon. W. G. Nevin, 'general
manager of the Santa Fe lines west of
Albuquerque, was the first witness to
give testimony. C. N. Sterry, solicitor of
the Santa Fe, with headquarters at Los
Angeles, conducted the direct examina
tion. Frank N. Short represented the oil
men.
Nevin testified that the cost of .moving
a ton of freight on the Valley road was
79.08 cents. Including all operating ex
penses such as are produced at terminals,
etc., the proportional expense would
he $2.60. On the same basis of computa
tion the witness said that the cost to
move a barrel of oil from Bakersfield to
San FTancisco was 47.55 cents.
According to Nevin the Valley road
is not a source of much revenue to the
Santa Fe. Figuring interest on boncis
representing $6,500,000 there was a deficit
of $250,000 for the fiscal year. "The Val
ley road couldn't pay its pay roll, to say
nothing of maintenance as a local road,"
said Nevin. As peculiarities of oil freight
ing Nevin said it cost just as much to
haul three empty oil tank car 3 back as to
ship two from Bakersfield.
Captain A. H. Payson testified as to the
construction of the Valley road, saying
that it was certainly built economically
and that cars could be operated on it at
a reasonable expense.

LADIES DEBATE
RACE QUESTION
Mrs. Julius Kahn Ably
Defends the Negro
Women.
Favors Permitting Them to
Join the Federation
of Olubs.
The rooms of the Philomath Club were
crowded yesterday afternoon with mem
bers and friends of tlie organization. It
was the occasion of the much talked of
debate on the mooted question "Should
the color line exist in women's clubs?"
This subject has been under discussion
for the last month. It was brougrht up by
the Women's Era Club of Boston, com
posed of colored women, when they ap
plied for admission to the G neral Feder
ation of Women's Clu>)3. Debates on tr-Â«
subject are being neld throughout the
country, and the result has in each case
been sent to the mother organisation.
Next summer the aniiual session of the
federation will be held in the city of Loa
Angeles. At that time the subject will be
taken up, and it will then be decided
whether colored women shall be permit
ted to be on an equality with the white
women of the country.
At the Philomath Club the debate was
highly interesting. Mrs. Herman Heyne
man and Miss Annie E. Pratt had the
affirmative, and Mrs. Julius Kahn and
Miss Mabel Cl-ilre Craft the negative. The
papers read were able and clearly denned
the stand of both sides.
Mrs. Kahn Upholds Black Sisters.
The affirmative comended that colored
women should not ba permitted to join
the federation, upon :ht ground that they
were not of sufficiently high standard to
affiliate with the white sex. Among thÂ«
interesting papers read at the meeting
was that presented by Mrs. Julius Kahn,
wife of the Congressman from this city.
In part it is as follows:
To present the other side of the picture, to
endeavor to show that colored women merely
because they are colored and Irrespective of
merit education, culture, breeding or any at
the attributes that go to make a good and
noble woman should be excluded from the gen
eral federation of women's clubs. This is not
to be a defense of the colored race, nor a plÂ«a
for the social recognition of the colored womrni
.(neither of which have the slightest bearing
upon the subject) â merely reasons why we s.s
American women should extend at least a help
ing hand to struggling womanhood, who in
spite of the terrific handicap ot race, color and
prejudice have risen above their surroundings
to such a degree that tnÂ«ir application for
membership Into the general federation wns
deemed worthy of the earnest and careful cun
sideration which it has received and is receiv
ing from the various women's organizations of
this country.
I know nothing of the personnel of the club
that applied for admission. I have a vague
idea it is a club of Massachusetts women, but
that has nothing to do with the consideration
of the question, from the abstract point of
view.
The fact that the application was consider- d
and the only objection raised was that of
color Is sufficient guarantee that in other re
spects the club filled the requirements of ad
mission. The members do not seek recogni
tion on the sympathetic plea, but on their
own merit and desire to win recognition as
women. They would not accept it as a grat
uity to an Inferior race.
Race Prejudice Inherent.
It looks as if race prejudice were inherent
in all men, and the enlightenment that comes
with intellectual culture may temper It. but
seldom succeeds In eradicating It completely
We surely have no other reason than that of
race prejudice to refuse them admission, and
in weighing this question it is better to prac
tice the golden rule than to repudiate it.
"Keep them out," Is the cry of the element
posing as conservative. "It is only the enter
ing wedge. They will demand social recogni
tion next." And If they do It rests with each
of us individually to refuse them social recog
nition if we wish. But even if we deny them
this shall we exclude them from the broauor
and broadening Influence of club life.
We preach the doctrine of humanity. Our
very government of which we are so proui
rests on a foundation of equal rights. Our
religions teach us a universal brotherhoodâ
that we are all one In sight of one God, yet
we arÂ« ready to refuse these women, who by
force of character, by dint of hard work, have
lalsed themselves far beyond their original po
sition, the recognition to which they are en-
Now at a crucial point in the history of the
relationship between blacks and whites, when
the whole country Is duscusslng the race prob
lem we as women are called upon to decide
whether we will airetch forth a helping hand
to our dusky sisters, help them to rise and
In helping them help the whole people. The
evolution of a race comes slowly, and a race
cannot advance independent of individual
growth No race has ever advanced as a
whole, at one and the same time, like a com
pany of soldiers on parade. Individuals muÂ»t
flr=t advance and furnish both means and in
centive to enable others to do likewise.
Shall we push these women back into the
depths from which they have sprung, deny
them the fruits of their labor and discourage
them so that others following their example
may lose heart? It is only through contact
with the whites that the salvation of the
negro can be accomplished.

FINAL RESULTS
ARE ANNOUNCED
Election Commissioners
Complete Their
Canvass.
No Big Errors Are Discovereo
and the Ticket Is Un
changed.
The Board of Election Commissioners
yesterday announced the result of the
caiivass of the votes cast at the late mu
nicipal election. The changes in the fig
ures between the semi-official and official
returns are so slight as to afford but lit
tle encouragement to defeated candidates
who contemplate making contests. In
many Instances the vote is close and
there is a possibility of technical errors
making a change in a legal contest.
The total vote cast was 53,746. The only
change of moment discovered in the can
vass was a gain of 84 votes for Byington
for District Attorney over the figures re
turned to the Registrar by the election
boards. In other cases the changes
ranged from 3 to 10 votes. In one case,
that of George Alper3, Republican nomi
nee for Supervisor, there was no change
between the official and semi-official re
turns. _ "
The official figures as returned by the
Registrar are as follows:

head Newhalh
Kayor Elect Declines to Express His
Private Opinion Concerning Witt
man's Appointment as Chief
of Police.
Mayor-elect Eugene E. Schmitz's sojourn
at \\ atsonville has developed his bump of
caution to the degree that he positively
refuses to discuss public affairs in detail.
A Cay or two after his election he did not
disdain to outline" his iÂ»olicy to The Call,
but since his return from the country he
uecunes io continue that particular line
of discussion. .Never*, he received
a (.ii.il representative v-ith courtesy yet
terday ana in a general way expressed his
ideas guardedly upon topics wrought to
ms attention by The Oali reporter.
4 Â¦\\ hat do you think of toe appointment
of Captain Wittman as Chief of Police,
Mr. St-Ximitz?" wat asked.
-i haven't given the >.uoject any special
thought," was the reply. "'1 doubt if '.ho
commissioners wouia nave paid any at
tention to my views in <my case."
Â¦jjo you mean by that that you would
have given an opinion adverse to Wit:
laan had you teen consiliteo. in the mat
ter".'" ' :Â¦ .-â¢ :
"â¢No. 1 mean just what I say," was ths
S^iaraed reply. "The appointment of a
chief of Police rests with the Police
commissioners i entirely, The action of
that body, therefore, rr<*y be regarded as
nal. 1 could not have prevented the ap
pointment Â¦ even had 1 uesired-to do so.
What- my private opinion may be I do not
care to say."
"Do you think the appointment meets
with the approbation of the labor un â¢
ions?"
"X cannot answer that question. No
labor union has filed a protest with me
relative to the matter."
As to Newhall's Position.
"A report is current that it is your pur
pose to demand Police Commissioner New
nail's resignation as soon as convenient
after your Induction into office. Will you
deny or affirm that rumor?"
"I cannot do either at this time. Under
the charter no Commissioner appointed by
the Mayor may be removed except for
good and sufficient cause. If any Com
mission* falls to do his sworn duty I
will remove him. At present I have no in
tention "_o remove any one when I assume
the discharge of my official duties. That
course *rill be dependent upon the results
of The investigations which 1 will prose
cute without delay after 1 take my office,"
"Which commissions is it your purpose
to investigate ?"
"All of them," answered Mr. Schmltz
decisive,}-.
The Mayor-elect spoke of his trip to the
country- He said he passed his time
studying: the charter and particularly that
portion of it which defines the duties and
authority of the Mayor. The sections re
lating to the streets were not neglected,
for it is his intention to watch street im
provements with a vigilant eye.
"We iÂ«?ed public improvements," he re
sumed cheerfully. Â¦â¢That subject has long
been neglected in San Francisco. We
want more and better school buildings.
We want better paved streets. We want
to give all classes of citizens equal
benefits in this respect. One part of the
city should not be improved and another
neglected."
"Havei you decided upon the personnel
of any of your appointments?"
"I ha: re not." Â¦Â¦-;â¢â¢
"Who: will you select as your private
secretai y?"
"I dci it know yet."
The Mayor-elect remarked that his wife
was not: quite well, and this brought up
the ma;;ter of his failure to attend the
banquet of the Merchants' Association
last weÂ«jk.
"It is reported that your refusal to at
tend the banquet on the. ground that
your wife was ill was a mere evasion and
that you feared to attend the banquet for
reasons best known to yourself. Is the
report Tell based?"
"It ts a ridiculous assertion," re
sponded the Mayor-elect warmly. "Why
should ,1 fear to meet the local mer
chants anywhere? It is foolish to hint
at anything of the kind. The fact was
that raj-w ife was too ill for me to risk
leaving her for even an hour. There was
no opera bouffe about the affair. I re
gard my duty to my family before every
thing e.se in this life. Since my return
I have teen forced to refuse numerous in
vitation of a social character, and why?
simply because my little daughter, whom
I idolize, is lying sick at this moment
with pneumonia. While the little girl is
now eorrvalescent I nevertheless refuse to
stir fran my house until I have the as
surance that my help is not required. I
think more of my wife and children than
of all t,iÂ« world besides. I am *o hypo
crite, whatever i else my â¢ political * op
ponents may term me. My declination
to attend the merchants* banquet was
based on honest grounds and that is all
there is to it." â¢ i
The Mayor-elect was called to the tele
phone at this juncture and the interview
was closed.

SCHEME TO ALLOW YELLOW HORDES
TO CROSS THE MEXICAN BORDER
M. F. Tarpey and John E. Bennett Revive G'gantic Plan to Give
Orientals Free Passageway to Evade Exclusion Laws, Hoping
to Secure Concession for Colonizing the Southern Republic
SIMULTANEOUS with the popuKr
demand that the Chinese exciu
sion law shall be re-enacted in or
der to protect the interests of t>io
workingmen of the United States,
news comes from Mexico that a bold plan
is being carried out in order that hordeb
of Orientals may be allowed to land in
this country.
M. F. Tarpey, the well-known Demo
cratic politician, and John E. Bennett,
the attorney for Ho Vow, the Chinese
Consul General, are ihe leaders in a plan
which, unless immediately blocked, will
flood the United States with thousands of
Chinese via the border line of Mexico.
In January of this year Tarpey was the
president of the Pacific Charter Company,
that claimed to have secured concessions
from the Mexican Government to estab
lish stedmship lines between Mexico and
China for the purpose of colonizing the
Mexican republic with 1,000,000 coolie la
borers, but in reality to allow the Chi
nese to slip over the Mexican borderMnto
the United States.
The expose of the scheme by The Call
and the denial by the Mexican authorities
at the time that Tarpey and his asso
ciates had received any concessions, as
claimed, effectually Llocked the bold
scheme.
When in January last Tarpey and his
confreres sought to secure capital for
their proposed colonization and fishing
concessions in Mexico thousands of circu
lars, printed in Chinese, were scattered
in Chinatown and in the Oriental quarters
of all large American cities.
The plans of Tarpey'^ company are al
most identical with the proposed conces
sion, that is likely to be granted by the
Congress of Mexico at any day.
According to the Chinese circular issued
last January Tarpey and his friends in
tended to bring from China to Mexico
more than 1.000,000 coolies. Just- how
many were to remati- in Mexico Tarpey
did not state. It is a well-known fact
that the Chinese have no desire to settle
In Central America or South America.
The United States -l good enough for
them, for Ivere are their friends and rela
tives, who have made fortunes in many
trades and callings.
With an influx of Or entals into Mexico
it would be an impossible task for the
American authorities to prevent the
coolies from flocking across the line into
the United States. Ir fact, it would re
quire an army of huge proportions to
guard the border.
Bait for Chinese Investors.
According to trtÂ» articles of incorpora
tion filed on December 15. 19C0, in the of
fice of the County Clerk the following.
were interested with Tarpey in his Mexi
can colonization sche-ne: Â»
Michael F. Tarpey, Alameda; L. K. Kent
well, Honolulu: Arthur B. Tarpey. Alameda;
John E. Bennett, Berkeley; K. E. Harrington,
Oakland.
The capital stock was to be $12,500,000,
divided into 500.000 shares of the par value
of $25 each. The circular issued a year
ago to the Chinese people in their own
language told clearly the objects of the
Tarpey scheme.
The Chinese circular, translated Into
English, Is as follows:
The Pacific Charter Company propose* on be
half of the Mexican Government to encourage
Chineee as -well as Europeans to come to Mex
ico and have special privileges. At present
CHARGES JOHN H. DOLAN
WITH MURDERING MOLE
j Coroner's Jury Hears Evidence at In
quest to Effect That He Did
Stabbing.
The Coroner's jury yesterday charged
; John H. Dolan with the murder of Albert
i A. Mole on November 22 in front of 237
: O'Farrell street.
John Peters, a bartender in the saloon
j at 236 O'Farrell street, told about Mole,
i Dolan and H. B. B. Chatman having had
a dispute in his saloon about the payment
! for some drinks a few minutes before the
i murder. Sergeant of Police Helms and
i Police Patrolman Davids testified that
Chatman said to them when they notified
1 him of Mole's death, "Well, if he is,
! Dolan killed him."
George Zella and Willie Riley, mes
senger boys, testified that they passed the
' spot where the murder was committed
i and Chatman asked them what was it
I that had sent them to the scene Of the
' crime.
Riley saw the three men together, one
! of whom he identified as Chatman, and he
I saw one fall to the ground and the other
run away. The man who was at the side
of Mole "when he fell was Chatman.
Chatman told the same story that he
had already related to the police. The
i three men had been drinking and Im
i mediately before the stabbing Dolan and
] Mole were a little ahead of him and got
i into a dispute. Mole took off his coat and
j Chatman held it. A moment afterward
I Mole fell to the ground and Dolan walked
: rapidly away.
A charge of murder was entered against
I Dolan on the orison books.

MENT TO SECURE CONCESSIONS FROM THE MEXICAN GOVERN
MENT, WITH OBJECT OF FLOODING STATES WITH CHINESE.
there is but very little commerce between
Mexico and Asia and a new steamship com
pany is needed to take hold of the trade and
build It up. The Pacific Charter Company of
Mexico has made a contract to open a new
steamship line between Mexico and China* and
all goods from Mexico to China will be shipped
on this line.
According to concession or contract the Mex
ican Government promises to give the Pacific
Charter Company all rights to fish on the Mex
ican coast line. This concession Includes salt
fish, dried fish and shrimp and canning. To
do this great fishing brsinese Chinese are de
sired. These fishing grounds are good, large '
and wide.
There is plenty of room for a million Chinese
fishermen. There Is plenty of all kinds of
fish and shrimp. Near the beach the land Is
very rich and one can raise all kinds of vege
tables, fruit and sugar cane and coffee.
The climate is very good and warm, like
that of Hongkong. The rainy season is good
and does not leave the surface of the ground
mushy. There Is no sickness. There is a
space of 4000 miles of Pacific coast in Mexico.
The president of the .company, M. F. Tar
pey, has resided in Mexico about ten years.
He is a friend of the Mexican President and
hi? officers and knows all the fishing places.
He knows all about land and water rights,
having traveled several years In Mexico.
Tempting Offers Are Made.
The Pacific Charter Company has made- a
contract with China and the Mexican Govern
ment to admit free of duty for fifty years all
Chinese necessaries, such as.tea, rice, etc. In
one year steamships will be running between
ports in Mexico and to China. There is a
steamship company in this city now willing
to take both fishing and Â¦ exporting business.
The name of the company Is the Pacific Char
ter Company.
Rich men from New York are in the steam
ship company, but the laborers and fishermen
are expected to come from China. The fisher
men from China are expected to come in groups
of fifteen to twenty, each group to have a
foreman. The company gives the foreman
license to fish and shows him where to fish.
The company cannot buy tÂ»iÂ» fish or import
Chinese goods into Mexico. Tie Chinese mer
chants in San FranclÃco, throufcli the foremen,
do all this. All the company wants Js the
freight.
The rules are:
NETTIE B. CRAVEN TAILS
TO SECUBE NEW TRIAL
Judge Troutt Refuses to Grant th-3
Motion Made by James G.
Maguire'.
The motion fof a new trial of Nettie R.
Craven's famous suit f-sainst the Fair es
tate was denied by Judge Troutt yester
day. The' decision of Judge Slack, who
declared the deeds pin ported to be made
by James G. Fair to be forgeries, is thus
sustained.
The motion for anew trial of the case
was made by ex-Judge James G. Ma
guire. At the time the motion was mad;
Mrs. Craven sought to secure a change of
venue on the ground that Judge Trout 1 :
was prejudiced, but her efforts were de
feated, and after an argument lasting
several days the motion to reopen the
proceedings was submitted.
The decision of Judge Troutt, renderel
yesterday, practically prevents Mrs. Cra
yen from again trying to secure the Mis
sion street and Pine street properties,
which she claims Fair deeded to her.

:. te The wording of the concession enume
9 rates all that was set forth in the Chinese
circular issued by Tarpey and Bennett
et al. in January last. Â¦ Â¦_Â¦ nrnnrwrl
A . significant a feature Â¦in the proposed
* concession is the one that gives the com
pany two years in which to build and
j operate its steamship lines. - , _
This proviso looks suspicious in the face
* of the appeal by the , Chinese diplomats
Â¦ that the exclusion laws.be. suspended for
Â¦ that time "just as an experiment to see
â¢-."-'â¢.â¢ .-' . Â¦ Â¦ â :: â 'â v
how it will work." By that time Tarpey
and Bennett would have their steamship
lines operating and exclusion laws would
fail to keep the hordes of Mongolians
from crossing the border of Mexico into
the United States.
A prominent member of the local Mexi
can colony, In â¢ speaking of the matter,
said yesterday:
My country has no objection to the Chinese
for' we have a large territory to fill. But our
Government does not understand the Chinese
as the Americans do. We possibly have about
5000 Chinese in Mexico. The Government evi
dently took the tempting bait offered by Tar
pey and Bennett and is likely to secure the
passage of the bill by our Congress.
You cannot get a Chinese to remain in Mex
ico if he sees the slightest chance to get into
the United States. They have their relatives
in America and have heard how quickly
wealth is made in this big republic.
This talk of fishing privileges and canneries
to be erected is simply a blind to the eyes of
our Government. Of course there had to be
some excuse to land hundreds of thousands of
Chinese in Mexico and what more plausible
than that of the fishing privileges and can
neries. For one Chinese that might remain in
Mexico, ninety would slip across the border
into America.
If this country does not wish to see a Chi
nese invasion via the border line of Mexico
it must take immediate steps. A friendly sug
gestion by the American Government to the
Mexican republic that the proposed concession
to Tarpey and Bennett is objectionable would,
without doubt, secure the rejection of the
grant.
Chinese Guarantee $1,000,000.
It Is freely hinted at in certain quarters
that the Chinese residents in America
have guaranteed more than $1,000,000
toward the proposed plan of Tarpey and
Bennett and that the money will be put
up as soon as the concession is secured
from the Mexican Government.
With a line of steamships running from
China to Mexico and with the knowledge
that it Is almost impossible to guard the
American-Mexican border, the Chinese are
not likely to worry much as to how to
evade the extension of the exclusion laws.

GEARY DOES
POLITICS FOR
HIS FRIENDS
Partisan Commission Is
Named to Represent
the State.
Attempt at Fusion Between
Union Labor and Demo
cratic Parties.
Nominated to Serve California, For
mer Santa Rosa Lawyer Becomes
Nothing- More Than Exam
iner's Mouthpiece.
Thomas J. Geary, chairman of the Cal
ifornia Chinese exclusion convention, ha.3
announced the committees to serve this
State and coast in the broadest and most
vital movement that has= ever engaged the
attention of the citizens of this and sia
ter coast States. One glance at the per
sonnel of the commission appointed wiil
disclose instantly how Thomas J. Geary,
intrusted with a general and honest duty,
has prostituted himself and the cause of
the State on the altar of politics.
Knowing full well Irom a purview of
Thomas J. Geary's political career and
his record in the Nome cases what was
likely to happen, The Call predicted that
out of his narrow-mindedness he would
sacrifice the best interests of the public
for the satisfaction of those who made
of him their mouthpiece and their puppet
during the proceedings of the convention
lately concluded.
Here are the names of the Commission
ers of California to "Washington : Andrew
Furuseth, ex-Governor James H. Budcl,
Truxton Beale, James D. Phelan and Ed
ward J. Livernash.
All parties have by right the claim of
equal representation on these commit
tees, yet there is but a single Republican
named among the Commissioners, against
four Democrats. Truxton Beale is the
single one who is not of Thomas J.
Geary's own political persuasion.
The commission is really an Examiner s
nomination. Edward J. Livernash is an
employe of the Examiner. Thomas
J. Geary took the orders that issued from
the Examiner building, obeying every one
of its behests and declaring from the
platform sentiments and opinions molded
and formed by his master.
So mendacious and at the same time so
patent in intent are these appointments
by the man who was selected to do a gen
eral service for the people of the coast
that there is no need of reading between
the lines. Thomas J. Geary intends with
his fellows to do politics at some future
day and this is the means they take. It
ia nothing more nor less than an attempt
at fusion between the Democrats and the
Union Labor party. Between them they
hope to ride the horse of exclusion to fu
ture political preferment.
The secretary of the commissioners of
California to Washington, though not of
ficially named, Is to be J. McLaughl.n, sec
retary of the Brotherhood of Teamsters.
Geary, who has denied all lawyers who
have' had Chinese for clients the privilege
of speaking at the convention, has done
his first partisan work for himselfâ Geary*,
the man who has had more Chinese busi
ness of a non-exclusion nature than all
the rest of the attorneys who represent
the Mongols.
COMMISSIONERS ABE NAMED.

fornia Exclusion Convention, announces

HO YOW TALKS
TO UNITARIANS
Chinese Exclusion Forms
Subject for Long
Debate.
' . The Unitarian Club listened last evening
to a ' debate betwen picked orators con
cerning the re-enactment of the law
which excludes Chinese from, the Lnited
States. The champions of continuing the
present policy of exclusion were Mayor
Phelan and Thomas J. Geary. The other
side was taken by- Chinese Consul Ho Tow
and Dr. Fryer of the University of Cali
fornia. President Gregory of the Lm
tarian Club presided at the debate which
took place after a dinner in the Mer
chants' Club rooms. Business and profes
sional men listened and applauded, lber-
a M*ivor Phelan opened the discussion. He
said that exclusion was the settled policy
oftheUmfed States ana had oeen sucxx
for twenty years. At the time 01 the

was an opinion that cneap Chinese labor

rested 'The question was introduces by
Sf P n who were speaking from soap. boxes.
> An? student would know that the Chi
nese in the United States came from the
(Son Province; which ; had only 20.000.
m inhabitants. If the exclusion law
should fail â¢to be re-enacted the effect
would be that only the Cantonese would

Advocates Servile i- Class.
Ttte first Chinese visited the United
States because they were persuaded to
do so by the Union and Central Pacific
railroad companies, which could not get
white labor to build their railroads.
When the roads were built the Chinese
laborers: were turned off to find employ
ment .or themselves.
Ho Vow asserted t.iat if there was no
exclusion act the Chinese,. could not com
pete with white labor. . Every channel of
fife must be filled, he said. 1 If all were
rich there w would- be none to cook for
them or to do their washing; â¢Â¦ ' The coun

casian, he said that it would be danger

England respect; the United States? Be
cause they were being : undersold. China
had : one-third of the _ population of the
: Ho Vow insisted that Chinese exclusion
would interfere with the , trade of the
United â¢ States with China. : . The Chinese
were '< not without sentiment and they re
sented an injury. During the recent war
with Spain the clothing manufacturers of
San Francisco could not "get white people
to work on the clothes for the American
soldiers at ; the : price they ! wished to pay.
What would have become of : the soldiers
if the Chinese 'r had ": not made : their
clothes? .. The Â¦-. clothing manufacturers
would, say that .white people did not wish
to work f or : a Â¦ pittance. . The Chinese as
laborers . filled " places that white people
did 5 not want. . ,
". Geary , Opposes Ho Vow.
Â¦ Thomas J. ; Geary attacked IHo Tow's
conclusions vigorously. He said that the
country .in > the > civil war . clothed i and fed
1,000.000 men â¢ for years, , without : the aid
of Chinese â¢or any other people. Then
was carried on a, war to preserve a coun
, try > based upon manhood. . Ho Vow had
spoken as it might be supposed he would,
for he represented a civilization ia which
one class enjoyed all the luxuries and the
other class served them. That was the
attitude of the men who fired on Fort
Sumter. Mr. Geary dwelt on the hl3- y
of the United States and held that 'Iw
institution of a servile class, such a? H'>
Vow had suggested, could only end in
disaster to this country.
The trade argument Mr. Geary declared
to be a sham. China had 350,000,000 peo
ple steeped in poverty, who could not
buy the products of American mills. Ha
quoted figures to show that 30,000 white
men who might take the place of 30.000
Chinese would spend more than double
the value of the 3nnual exports of San
Francisco to China.
Dr. Fryer closed the debate. He ad
mitted that the United States could ex
clude whom it chose to exclude, but per
haps there would be an objection if the
Chinese Government should exclude
Americans from China.
