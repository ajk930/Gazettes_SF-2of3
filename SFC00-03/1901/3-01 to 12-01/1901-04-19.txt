AND PRAISES THE CHANCELLOR
Now that The palace is entirely destroyed
It may have a bearlnsr on the return of
the imperial family. While there' is no
longer the objection that the palace is oc
cupied by' the foreien commander yet a
pation of the imperial palace was a mov
ing cause for the rejection of all over
tures for the return of the imperial family
to Peking. From the Chinese standpoint
it was impossible to even consider the
return of the imperial family as long as
the commander-In-chlef cf the allied
forces was in actual occupation of the
Empress 1 palace.
The suspicion of incendiarism is j not
borne out. It is believed the . fire orig

The ' discovery was made by workmen
who were excavating for a building bein^
put up at Guadalajara by the Standard
Oil Company. L. Blumenthal, who owns
stores at El Paso and Guadalajara,
brought the news from there to-night and
vouched for the truth of the story in de
tail. Blumenthal states that the well
when discovered was p^ifectly dry and
very deep. After the yase3 had escaped
a man was sent down end the treasure
drawn out. Many sucn discoveries, but ia
smaller amounts, have been made in the
different States of Mexico since the evac
uation of the Spaniards, and the theory
advanced is that the Spaniards when they
were driven from . the City of Mexico
sought the smajler towns and buried their
treasures for safe keeping. Many never
returned to reclaim them and thev ars
now occasionally found. It Is stated in
several of 'Mexico's hiftorlcs that over
$5,000,000 worth of purÂ»Â» silver was taken
from churches and other public buildings
by the Spaniards when they left the capi
tal, "and much of it has never bÂ»jen found.

Concerning Colonel Woodruffs dispatch
in connection with that sent by General
MacArthur it is apparent that the com
missary department proper has been re
lieved of all responsibility, for the frauds .
that have occurred. The j seriousness of
the frauds is apparent from the fact that
three officers and a number of enlisted
men are being tried by court-martial and
a number of civilians are undergoing trial
by a military commission. Basing his
opinion upon facts at hand, a high offi
cial of the War Department said to-day
that the frauds grew out of the sale of
rations by officers, men and civilians to
whom they had been issued to storekeep
ers in Manila, who could only Import sup
plies at a high cost. Army stores could
be . purchased from army men and civil
ians, who were allowed rations at about
the same price that they could be ob
tained at retail In Chicago. The men im
plicated in the frauds, according to this
official, probably fcund the business re
munerative, and It was. of cour3e. advan- '
tageous-to hotel and store keepers. Tho
aggregate amount of losses sustained by
the Government Is believed to be com
paratively small. At the same time Gen
eral MacArthur will take Immediate
measures for preventing any further ras
cality of the kind.
Will Check the Kascality.
Commissary General Weston received a
dispatch from Colonel Woodruff to this
effect: "Do not permit J scandalous re
ports to worry you. The affairs of the
subsistence department of the army are
administered honestly and satisfactorily
to officers and troops."
There Is no further disguise on the part
of the War Department of the fact that
fraud has been perpetrated at Manila In
connection with the disposition of Gov
ernment stores. That such practices have
been extensive is officially denied by Gen
eral MacArthur: that they are certainly
serious is shown by him in a dispatch
containing his denial- General MacAr
thur's statement was received this mom-
Ing and was in answer to an Instruction
sent by Secretary Root directing him to
report by cable "on the Associated Press
reports from Manila implicating certain,
subsistence officers of the army in fraud
ulent practices," arfd enjoining him to
take severe and drastic measures to pun
ish the guilty.
No Further Disguise of Fraud.
" When asked concerning the Identity of
the prisoner Secretary Root and other
officials of the department insist that ha
is Emillo Aguinaldo and no other. Some
of them refer to the conferences Aguinal
do has had with Filipinos known to be
friendly to the United States, and It ls
said that if there was any doubt as to the
identity of the prisoner. Secretary Root
would certainly have been definitely ap
prised of It before now.
There ls a curious report concerning the
prisoner in circulation in the War De
partment, which is only whispered by
responsible officers. It is that the insur
gent captured by General Funston is not
Emllio Agulnaldo, but a cousin of the in
sursrent chief.
If Aguinaldo refuses to aid this Gov
ernment in effecting a surrender of the
Filipinos in arms, the authorities say, he
can be tried for violation of the laws of
War" and severely punished. General Mac-
Arthur "has doubtless impressed upon
Agulnaldo the delicate position he occu

Root on March 29 that "m a result of

Three weeks have passed and the address
has not yet appeared. There have been
frequent exchanges of messages between
Secretary Root and General MacArthur
relating to Aguinaldo'3 attitude, but these
are kept secret for reasons of state.
Enough was learned, however, 1 to show
that Agulnaldo is disinclined to comply
with General MacArthur's wishes, and
this change is ascribed to his former
counselors in Manila, with whom he was
"War Department officials, who were at
first Insistent In their belief that a proc

out in the "W. Pewees Wood plant in Mc-
Keesport last "week and which for a time
threatened ta' cause a general strike of all
union Iron and steel workers in the coun
try has -been- settled in -air amicable man
ner. The members of the general execu
tive board, of the Amalgamated Associa
tion of Iron, Steel arid ; Tin "Workers held
a long session to-day. 'It started out with
a general feeling that a strike would
come, as the workers would not concede
the only point in dispute (reinstatement
of the men discharged, it la claimed, for
joining the union), and so far as could be
learned the officials of the American Sheet
Steel Company were equally determined.
During the. morning session of the ex
ecutive board John Jarrett. acting for the
American Sheet Steel Company, appeared
with' a proposition for the members to
consider regarding a settlement of the
difficulty. In general this proposition was
that all men discharged from the "Wood
plant should be reinstated, including Hol
loway, and that all but Holloway should
return to work at once, Holloway to be
returned within ten days.
The board insisted th?it Holloway should
be treated in the same manner as the oth
ers, and finally Mr. Jarrett changed his
proposition to include Holloway after
three days' suspension, and the agreement
was drawn up and signed at 7 o'clock to
night, as follows:
"We have discovered after a careful examina
tion of the points at issue that, as usual, mis
takes and misunderstandings underlie the
trouble at "McKeesport, and we reach the con
clusion that It will be to the advantage of all
parties concerned to start the "Wood mill with
the old employes on next Monday, April 22,
1901.
And it Is- further agreed that the contract
with reference to working- conditions In the
mill and scale matters shall be observed until
July 1, 1901. and in the meantime Mr. Smith
and Mr.. Holloway shall have a meeting to
adjust any difficulties which mar exist between
them. T. J. SHAFFER.

. In explanation of this agreement it was
stated that the matter will remain in ex
actly the same position as before the
trouble broke out. The organization of the
locals of the Amalgamated Association
among the employes of the mill will be
continued, though the company will not
recognize it in any way In dealing with
the men. The Amalgamated Association
stated they did not wish the company to
recognize their organization at present,
and sjmply asked the company to allow
the men to do as they pleased and act
with freedom when outside of the mill.
The company officials, on the other hand,
say that so long as tha local among their
men does not try to force recognition and
the men work under the personal agree
ment with the.m they would not allow
any feeling against the men. Both sides
are satisfied, and the strike that has ex
isted for a> week nas in reality, according
to the officers on both sides, been due to a
misunderstanding between the two sides
to the dispute. â¢-. ; .". , ..
The settlement will bring the matter to
an issue, it is raid, when the scale for the
coming year is brought up for settlement.
The union will seek at that ttroe to havÂ«
the Wood plant included in the next scale
agreement, and the company it Is believed
will be ready to oppose this part of the
agreement emphatically. â¢. . , .
When asked to-night concerning thia the
'officials of the Amalgamated Association
said they would not cross a bridge until
they came to it. The company officials
replied in the same strain. At the conclu
sion of the conference this evening the
members of the executive board departed
for their homes. There did not* neem to
be any dlspostton on the .part of either
side of the dispute to claim a victory or
the better of the settlement.

My next proposal is a novel one; It Is an ex
port duty of a shilling a ton - on coal.- - In
aiming to secure a revenue from coal I am not
sacrificing trade. The imposition of a shil
ling, which is infinitely less than the fluctu
ations in price, will do no real Injury to the
coal trade, even supposing that the export of
coal is checked. I am not -sure that even the
result will be an evil.- From this source I ex
pect* Â£2,100,000, making an aggregate of Â£11,

My final balance sheet will be, from taxa
tion, a revenue of Â£122,200,000; from non-tax
ation, Â£21,055,000, a total of Â£143,255,000. I
propose to reduce the expenditure by again
suspending the sinking- fund to Â£182,962,000.
This shows a deficit of Â£39,927,000, to which
must be added Â£1,250,000 for tha fresh debt

give me borrowing powers considerably In ex

LOS ANGELES. April 18.-C. S. Young,
the lost Bakersfleld oil man, has been

to Deminpr, TJ. Mex., by Quarantine offi
cers. Tills information reached W. S.

day in a telegram from Young.
Those who are closest to Young were
not at first frightened by his sudden dis
appearance, but when they began tele
graphing to various points In Texas and
even the quarantine officers could give
no clew to his whereabouts every one of
them was frightened. The exact condi
tions under which Young was taken from
his train and deported are not known, but
It is understood that he was taken while
passing from one .car to another, thus
avoiding attracting attention, and that he
was taken to Deming by a petty official,
who neglected to notify his superiors.

Opening 'HoÂ£ Promising. .
The 'Chancellor of the Kxcheauer, Sir.
Michael Hicks-Beach, rest, at 4:18 p. m.
amid rounds of cheers and commenced che
budget statement; His opening sentence
was not promising:. Ha began:
During the last five vears we have been in
variably able to congratulate the house on a
general increase in the prosperity of the
country, but the year.lHOO, especially the last
tix months, showed symptoms of a change.
Our foreign trade during the year consider
ably increased, but- in value rather than in
volume. It is mainly derived from the high
prices of certain articles, notably coal, which
naturally must have injured important in
dustries especially railways. Nevertheless,
the revenue for the past year showed no sign
of decrease and the exchequer receipts showed
a surplus cf Â£2.866,000 over the estimates. I
am bound to say, however, that the excess
was due to forestallment on dutiable articles.
But for this my estimates would have been
barely realized. Much can be said for and
against forestallment. but It is an unmiti
gated nuisance to financial statistlcans. The
forestallments of 1S99-1900 amounted to Â£3,250,-
CCO, which properly belong to the revenue of
the last vear. The forestallment of the past
year somewhat exceeded the previous year. I
will say that the consuming power of the peo
ple is maintained, but there is no material
evidence of the expansion of that power be- ;
yond what is fairly attributable to increase
of population.
Beer Estimate Too High.
The Chancellor then proceeded to review
the various items of revenue, mentioning
that the revenue from beer was Â£4,000,000
lose than the estimate.
"That decrease," said he, "is probably
attributable to the fact that very many
beer drinkers are in South Africa, and
also to the decrease in the spending power
of the people, owing to the high price of
coat. Experience has shown that we have
practically reached the limit in the'profit
able taxation of spirits." The receipts
from duties were Â£1,500,000 below those of
the preceding year, but he had better
expectations for next year. Â»
The prolongation of the war and the
absence 'of buyers on the stock exchange
Â¦were responsible for the unsatisfactory
yield for stamps. In noting that the yield
from the income tax was Â£1,150,000 above
the estimate, the Chancellor remarked
that in twelve years the income on which
taxation was paid had been, increased by
no less than Â£120,000.000, a fact that he
hoped the House would remember when
he reached a l^ter part of his speech.
The only other points, of the revenue
"which ho heed touch upon, were ths ex
ceptional receipts owing to the mint, sil
ver, coinage- and the telegraph receipts,
which compared very favorably with the
expenditure. The total receipts amounted
to Â£130,385,000 and the expenditures Â£1S3,~
592,000. of which Â£65,000.000 was for the
war in South Africa and Â£3,000,000 for
China. The deficit, Â£53,207,000, showed
that they had paid Â£15,413,000 out of the
revenue for the cost of tho war. The to
tal amount provided by the Btate last year
aggregated tho enormous sum of Â£19S,
346,000.
"As to the national â¢ debt," said the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, "it stands
in painful contrast with last year. But
thu funded debt has decreased by Â£1,425,
000. April 1 the national debt stood at
Â£6S7.500,000. an increase of Â£55,000,000 on
account of the war."
Proposes Sugar and Coal Tax.
Turning to the present year, the Chan
cellor of the Exchequer said that the to
tal estimated expenditure was Â£167,600,000.
On the existing basis it was estimated
that the revenue would be Â£132,255,000,
leaving a deficit of about Â£55,000,000. Sir
Michael continued:
How is this deficit to be met? I will never
be responsible for the fatal policy of paying
the whole cost of the war out of loans with
out putting a. reasonable amount on the tax
payers of the day. The real difficulty, how
ever, is not so much the cost of the war in
South Africa as the operations In China, as
they will, Increase our ordinary expenditure
even if the war came to an end witbin three
or four months (this statement .caused cheer
ing from, the Irish members), or sooner than
the honorable members suppose. Our ordinary
expenditure would not permit of the remittance
of the additional taxation proposed for war
purposes last year. It therefore becomes'neces
sary to put our expenditures on a broader basis.
The country has reached a point when it is
necessary to widen 'the scope of taxation, but
direct taxpayers must, bear their share of the
burden. I propose that 2 pence shall be added
to the income tax, making 1 shilling and 2
pence in the pound. The extra 2 pence will
realize Â£3,800,000. There will be no addition
to the beer, wine, tea, spirits or tobacco duties.
I am not disposed to oppose a customs duty
on manufactured im pur ted goods as suggested
by Sir Howard Vincent.
The average consumption, of sugar Is flfty-slx
pounds per head. Sugar is taxed in every
other community in Europe and is taxed in
the United States. In this country taxes re
mained on sugar long after the institution of
free trade. What I propose is not a protective
duty, but an adequate public necessity has
arisen for some duty for which thÂ« laboring
classes should bear a fair share. The effect
of my proposals on the price of sugar is doubt
ful, as the price of sugar is governed by the
bounty-giving countries. . :
The Bounty System. ;
The bounty system is that a country giving
a bounty encourages production within its
borders and at the same time does its best to
restrict consumption by its own people by
every possible means. The result is that there
is an enormous surplus which has to find a
foreign market, and this country under the
present circumstances is the only market.
Therefore it is quite conceivable â unless, of.
course, the bounty-giving countries either re-
I duce the area of their sugar production or
1 lower their own duties on the sugar for the
benent of their own population, both of which
actions would mean the abolition of the
bounty system â that the result of the new.
tax, although at first . the price might rise
. and consumption consequently be reduced,
would be that there would be such an inflow
Into this country of bounty-fed sugar unable
to go elsewhere that the price might be
brought down. Again. I do not believe the
duty will injure manufacturers using sugar,
to- anything like the extent feared. Of course
provision will be made for imposing a duty on
manufactured articles from ' foreign countries
coming Into competition with the home article
and for allowing manufacturers a drawback
on articles which they export.' - 1 allow Â£ 240,
000 for the payment of these drawbacks. I
have endeavored to reconcile the conflicting
interests. Nothing must be done to protect
the British refiner to the disadvantage of the
British consumer. But. on the other hand,
fair play must be given to the British refiner
as "compared with his Continental rival. The
refiner of beet sucar must not be favored as.
arainst the refiner of cane sugar, or vice
versa. I propose a duty on refined sugar of
four shillings and two pence a hundredweight.
A haif penny per pound would be four shil
lings and eJght pence, so a. margin of six
pence is left to cover the customs, â¢handling,
etc. There is therefore no reason why a tax
of four shillings and two . pence should in-.
crease the retail price more than a half penny
per pound.. The graduated scale of taxation
would be as follows: Refined Bugar.^whlch is'
polarized at 98 and upward. , which represents
two-thirds 'of . the ? total imports, would pay
the full tax. This will -diminish to a , mini-- 1
mum of two shillings per hundredweight on
raw, sugar polarized at 76. This scale is only
tentative and I am perfectly willing to listen
to criticism and the btnefit of experience
and better knowledge., Â¦Â¦ Â¦ â¢ . . â¢.. .
Molasses, In which are included the grocery
syrups consumed largely by the poor, pays two
shillings per hundredweight; glucose ,of which
a great -deal has been, heard lately, and which
is used in the manufacture , of ' jams and
aerated waters, Â¦ will < have to bear a Â¦ tax of
1 shilling and 8 pence. I .'anticipate a yield

NERVOUS DYSPEPSIA.
A. CUBE-. FOB. .IT.
Not a Patent Cure- All, Nor a Modern
Miracle, but Simply a Rational
Cure for Dyspepsia. - -?.*>
In these days of humbuggery and decep-
tion the. manufacturers of patent medi-
cines, as a rule, seem to thinK their medi-
clr.e? will not sell unless they Â¦claim that
it will cure every disease under the sun.
And they never. think of leaving. out dys-
pepsia and stomach troubles. Â¦.; They are
sure to claim that their: nostrum is abso-
lutely certain to cure every, dyspeptic and
ho need look no further.
In the face of these absurd claims it is
refreshing to note that the proprietors of
Stuart's Dysrpepsia Tablets have carefully
refrained from making- any undue claims
or false representations regarding the
merits of this most excellent remedy for
dyspopsia and stomach troubles. They
make but one claim for it, and that Is,
thaf* for indigestion and various stomach
troubles Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets Is a
radical cure. They gt>" no farther than
this and any man or woman suffering
frcm lndlpestion. chronic or nervous dys-
pepsia, who will pive the remedy a trial
.wiil find that' nothing is ; claimed for it
that the facts will not fully sustain.
It Is a modern discovery, composed of
harmless vegetable ingredients acceptable
to the weakest or most delicate . stomach.
Its great success in curing stomach
troubles is due to the fact that the medi-
. cal properties are such that it will digest
whatever wholesome food Is taken into
the stomach, no matter whether the
stomach Is in good working order or not.
It rests the overworked organ -and re-
plenishes the body, the blood, the nerves
creating a healthy appetite gives refresh-
Ing Bleep and the blessings which always
accompany a good digestion and proper
assimilation of food. .
In using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets no
dieting is required. Simply eat plenty of
wholesome food and take these Tablets
at each meal, thus assisting and resting
the. stomach which rapidly regains its
proper digestive power, when 'the Tablets
will be no longer required.
Nervous Dyspepsia is simply-a condition
in which some portion or portions of the-
r.ervous system are not properly nour-
ished. Good digestion invigorates the ner-
vous system and every organ In the body.

There's the story in a nutshell, but we want to supplement it with a few
remarks about the making of the suits, just to make your interest keener. They
have been made in our workshops by union men. In the inside pock&t of every
coat is a label that proclaims this. It is the Union labelâthe stamp of quality, the
symbol of fair merchandise and the<emblem of good workmanship.
As the suits are our own make you buy direct from us, the makers', and thus
actually save all the middleman's profits. You get better quality at lower prices.
Let us prove it to you. * \ V
In addition to the Union label the suits bear our own "Yeargood" label, which
protects you. The Union label is a guarantee of the workmanshipâ our label is a
guarantee of the material. You are doubly safe in buying here.
The serges are all wool, well dyed a fast blue, stylishly cut from the collar of
the coat to the bottom of the trousers.
The tweeds are swell patterns of checks and stripes, also fashionably cut in
this season's latest styles.
A glance at our.windows will prove interesting.

The Dudes made their initial bows at
Recreation grounds yesterday and were
so abashed and flurried over the introduc
tion that at the critical moment the team
played a successful sHrship act and Los
Angeles scored. This was in the sixth,
and the one run the Orangemen made was
enough to win the game. .
The most sensational feature was the
toppling over of "King" Kelly from below
the Tehachapi. His head instead of the
bat deflected one of . Chief Borchers'
choicest in-curves and the "King fell
over, measuring his length in diamond
dust. Seventeen men, copious draughts
of Spring Valley and the sopping of the
brow brought the monarch out of a.30- r
second sleep. When he returned from the
paradise in which there is no baseball he
asked for Morley and an out-curve. ;
It was not until the fourth inning that
either side scored. Then the Angels took
wing and sent one of the chosen over the
route.' In the fifth this was repeated* and
also In the sixth: The Dudes scored* in
the sixth when Francks rolled out a
double and came -home-later on a fielder's
choice. It was Drennan's hit in the sev
enth that tied the score. With Held and
Ijohman on the sacks Drennan drove a
far-away grounder to center and the < boy
rang' twice at the end of the inning. -
The game was -won in the eighth, the

Joseph Bellegard is a riveter at the Un

named Lucy. He lives at 'the Pennsylva

his sweetheart have been in the., habit of
playing the "Borneo- and Juliet": balcony
scene on the upper v porch of , the hotel.
After billing and cooing for a time they
always became gay and started in singing
ragtime songs and doing a turn at buck
and wing dancing. A-j ! ' :
. S. H. Miller is an engineer at the Union
Iron Works and also ' lives at the Penn
sylvania Hotel. His bedroom window
opens on the balcony, and as Belle
gard's vigorous - wooing disturbed his
slumbers he protested Wednesday night.
Just in the midst of a ragtime song Mil
ler, who was > in bed. shouted, "Oh, cut'
that out." Bellegard replied. 'Til cut
you." The noise ceased and Miller pre
pared to enjoy his disturbed slumbers
again. In a few minutes Bellegard burst
open the door of Miller'sroom and'eom
menced to punch him on the face with his
fists.- Miller, yelled for help, and Police-;
man O'Connell appeared on the- scene and
arrested Bellegard for battery.
Bellegard appeared before Judge Mogan
yesterday, and after hearing -the 'evidence
the Judge convicted him and ordered him
to appear for sentence this morning. Both
of Miller's â¢ eyes were "clo'sed and his face
swollen to twice its natural size. .

TRIMBLE WAS UNABLE
Â¦â¢.... TO PUT OUT STIFT
DENVER, April 18.â By ' fajr the. most
interesting fistic contests that : 'has' oc
curred in Denver for some. time took plape
at the Denver '"Wheel Club to-night, when
Ben-Trimfele of San Francisco ~fbuglit a
ten-round draw with Billy Stiff Th.e fight
i-as'fast and at' different, times it looked
as "though either-might land the "finishing
punch. StiXt was the agrgTessor^ most of
the time, but Trimble's clever blocking
and ducking kept Stift from landing with
any effect. On the. other, hand, Trimble
frequently jabbed his. right hard to Stiffs
stomach as the latter \would rush in, and
several tiroes Billy, appeared to be winded.
Trimble was loth to mix it up with Stift,
cr the result might have been different,
for there were times when the latter
seemed tired and handled himself care
lessly. Stift tried hard to land one of his
vicious swings, but Trimble was not there.
In the last minute of the' tenth round
Stift quit fighting, evidently discouraged,
and Trimble "tried to put him out, but
could not "hit him hard enough, although
he landed several, g-ood' punches.
In the preliminaries Eddie Toy of San
Francisco put out Jack Jennet of St
Louis in the fourth with a hard right on
the stomach. - '- â¢ - .

htmm^, HOSE race-goers who plunged on
M |* the -favorites at Tanforan Park
j yesterdayâ and the list was a long
II one-put in a cold, bleak, unprof-
Itable ootine of it. Of the five
choices that suffered defeat. Ada N prob
ably carried the most money. The filly
was backed down to even money favorit
ism to take the third event, a six furlong
tprint, and Bard of Avon, the second
choice, won galloping in 1:13%. Mounce
Jet the favorite fall out of it at the start,
later coming with a rush and finishing
ahead of Andrattus for the place. Mounce
explained his ride to the satisfaction of
the Judges, and Charley Maybury gave
good reasons for the improvement shown
tar the I3ard.
It was reported around in inner circles
that Novia had regained her beat form,
and the mare with Mounce up ruled fa
vorite for the first event, a six furlong
tprint. Cut off soon after the start, she
wns never a contender. -Conley on Un
Cadcau, a 20' to 1 ehot, led to the stretch,
where Dominick took up the running with
Foul Play and at the wire won cleverly
lrom McAlbert. â¢
See rode Minerva, favorite for the first
maiden two-year-old dash, and it was a
* vÂ«rx cheap looking event. Only a few
dajs'ago m the Great Trial stakes tha
filly showed a world of speed, yet in this
latest essay she was beaten three lengths
in :<9. The winner turned up in Irma A,
piloted by Gouin, against which, coupled
with You You, 8 to 1 was laid. Redan ratt
a Rood second. .
. The chances of Achilles, first choice for
the second maiden scramble for two
year-olds, were ruined by Fred Atterbury.
Just as the barrier was sprung the last
named youngster wheeled around, com
pelling Mounce on "Achilles to pull up.
Escaping the mix-up, Thorpe on Hainault,
a 4 to 1 shot, went out and won easing up'
from Silesian and Pepper Sauce.
Billy Randall's Gauntlet had a decided
cail in the betting on the mile and a quar
ter selling run, closing a 11 to 10 chance.
After leading to the paddock St. Simon
ian,' which had been trailing throughout,
passed the choice, scoring very handily in
2:(#Vi. Topmast went lame, losing the
chow to Twinkler. The winner went to
the post at odds of 16 to 5. '
Alas, the 8 to 5 favorite, ran away from
hie .field in the closing five furlong dash.
Howcll, who rode Alleviate, had his sad
dle, turn, but stayed with the music pluck
ily, finishing in the place ahead of Spry
jUirk. -

The steamship Australia, Captain Law
less, eleven days from, Tahiti, arrived in
port last night and Is tied up at the
Oceanic wharf. The Australia had a par
ticularly good passage and put in a day
ahead of her schedule time. She brought
twenty-two passengers and a miscella
neous cargo, .principally vanilla.
Following is the list of cabin passengers:
Lieutenant P. Colllard. Judge R. Vig;ne. G.
L. Kennedy. Mrs. Kennedy. Princess Pomare,
Mrs. Atwater, A. T. Srander, M. Kurka, W.

Australia's Quick Passage.
The Monitor was built in 1862. but has
always,, been conslderd a stout old vessel.
Captain Donnelly was in command and
was accompanied by his wife. The bark
entine, being' lumber laden, may have
been partially dismasted and driven off
shore. In that event the only trouble
would be over running short of provisions.
People along the front are beginning to
wonder what has become of the old bark
entine Monitor. She sailed frqm Grays
Harbor twenty-six days ago in company
with the schooner Letitia. The latter
made the run to San Francisco in six
days. She parted from the Monitor In a
northwester. Kothlng has been heard of
the barkentine since and fears are en
tertained for her safety.

tura sailed for Sydney. N. S. W., via
Honolulu, Pago Pago and Auckland, yes
terday. She was crowded with passen
pers and had an immense cargo of freight.
Many of those aboard are for the Islands
but the through list for Sydney Is very
large for this time of the year.
p-rj-^HB United States army transports
|| Lawton and Rosecrans were re-
I leased from quarantine yesterday
Jt morning and later In the day an
chored off the Government wharf.
The officers and cabin passengers were
brought ashore on the Slocum, while the
men "were sent to the Presidio on the river
steamers Resolute and Grace Barton.
Besides the cabin .passengers, whose
names were published In yesterday's Call, Â¦
the Lawton brought from Manila twenty
nine officers and 642 men of the Thirty-'
ninth Infantry, one prisoner and elx stow
aways. The itosecraxLS brought, ten ' of
ficers and 281 men of the Thirty-fifth In
fantry, 260 casuals and discharged men,
two men of the marine corps, twenty-two
ex-Government employes, nine cabin pas-
Eeng/ers and five deported men.
The deported men are classed by the
authorities at Manila as "worthless."
They were too lazy to work and not
ashamed to beg. One of them Is a son of
Genera! Maceo, the Cuban patriot, and to
hear him talk one would think he was go
ing to raise a email rebellion on his own
account 'when he reaches Havana. His
name is Santiago Maceo and he went to
the Philippines from Cuba about a year
ago. For a time be acted as an Inter
preter for the liacabebe scouts, but the
Government found he was playing both
ends against the middle and discharged
him. The young fellow finally grew so
troublesome and obnoxious that he was
deported.
Among those who came up on the Kdse
crans were Lieutenant Colonel Walsh,
Major A- Lams, Major Dr. Matzget, Cap
tain Prescott. Captain Aldrich. Captain
Bucker, Lieutenants McNamara, Varis,
Fisk, Lefort, Chaplain, Swift, Harrison,
Malay, Cecil Humphreys and A. J. Gies,

The Rosecrans left here in September
last, and in the meantime has been car
rying prisoners to Guam and Subig Bay
and provisions to Taku. Among the men
taken to Guam were generals, colonels,
majors, captains and civilians, one of the
latter being Mabini, Agulnaldo's secretary
of state.
On her way from Honolulu the Lawton
passed the Oceanic Steamship Company's
Mariposa on April 11, at 1 p. m. On April
14 the British bark Vanduara. forty-eight
days out from Caleta Buena for San
Francisco, was spoken in latitude 32 de
grees 28 minutes north, longitude 135 de
grees 58 minutes 30 seconds west The cap
tain wished to be reported "all well."
The Lawton had a narrow escape two
days before leaving the Philippines. She
was backing out from Nasugbu Bay un
der a slow bell and struck a sunken rock.
Luckily the engineer had his hand on the
throttle and promptly shut off steam, the
vessel getting off with a severe bump.
The navy transport Solace will probably
get away for Manila to-day. All her
stores are in and everything Is In readi
ness for a start. --
The horse transport Arab Â¦will be here
for several wesks. Twelvt new furnaces
:have been ordered from New York for
her, and until they arrive repairs cannot
be made. The Arab, it will be remem
bered, broke down soon after leaving here
with horses for Manila and had to put
back. She was passed as ready for sea
fejr the Inspectors of hulls and boilers at
Seattle.

It is estimated that the extent of unexplored land
within the Antarctic se^s is not less than 10,000,000
square. miles, more than twice as large an area as. the
whole of Australia. Here and there, certain points
have been traveled over by explorers, but the extent
of land covered by thom is so small in comparison
with the immense range of the Antarctic continent
that virtually the region is completely unknown.
It is for the purpose of acquiring a fuller knowledge
of-the region that the four expeditions have been or
ganized. According 10 v. recently published pro
gramme the^ continent - for the purposes of the ex
ploration is to be divided into sections. The'British
Government expedition willdeal with 1 by far the lar
gest area, viz., that to the south of Australia and;
New Zealand, with" its land base on Victoria Land.
The Scottish expedition will operate to the south
east of Cape Horn to the western side of Grahams
Land. The German Government expedition will work
in the area between Australia and the Cape, .with
rOUR expeditions, one each from England,
Scotland, Germany and Sweden, are ; to start
1 this year for a combined attempt to explore the
vast unknown regions' ol the south polar circle. The
expeditions are to be fitted out separately and will act
separately, but arrangements have been made "to as
sign each a particular field foe operations, so fhat
their efforts will not conflict nor the work of one be
in any way a duplication of the work of anotHer. To
that extent, then, it may be said they will co-operate,
and consequently much may be expected of the results
of their explorations. - . , . Â¦ . Â¦, ';

T^p Germans are having a "nice little argument
ever the right. of a newspaper to publish reports of a
speech by the Emperor when the Emperor objects to
the publication. Herr Richter, one , of the leading
members of the Reichstag, maintains that a speech by
the Kaiser is public property, and says the subject
was fully discussed by the committee on copyright re
form and decided as' he has stated. If that be so the
Kaiser has but one recourse leftâ that of keeping his
mouth. shut. . . ;:':
Among other troubles Russia has a treasury scan

sum missing is in the neighborhood of $22,500,000,
and constitutes the largest defalcation in Russian his

wake up some morning and find himself stolen. '
THE New York Sun is opposed to the acceptance
of Carnegie's great gift for public libraries in
that city. It regards the Cost of sites and main
tenance as too much lor the city to bear, and thinks
that libraries do not contribute much to public intel
ligence, anyway.
This is a surprising attitude to be taken by an
.American newspaper. Public libraries have been from
the earliest times considered a valuable means of self
education. It is notorious that in the sections of this
country where there are the most public libraries
there is the least illiterscy.
With the public schools administered according to
their original purpose all young people are furnished
the key to further knowledge, which they may ac
quire by the use of books. That was exactly Car
negie's case. He received the rudiments of an edu
ucation and acquired the rest by self-exertion. He
has said that his greatest difficulty was in getting such
books as he required for study. By great privation
and sacrifice these were secured, and in them he found
the way to a career that has astonished the commer
cial world. He then m^dc up his mind that, if he ac
quired wealth, he would put within reach of youth the
books which he had to obtain by enduring physical
privation.
In his case we find all the elements that make for
the public library. It opens to ambitious and ab
stemious youth the whole field of self-education. It
is the open university to all who will enter. A well
selected public library will equip a man for a trade, a
I-rofession, a scientific or industrial specialty. Where
a free library is there is the door to higher education.
It is amazing that ihe Sun, which so illuminates its
ntdius, fails in that great light to see this. The pub
lic library is the extension of the public school. It is
tlit projection of all scholastic opportunity. Carne
gie's gift to New York City is the addition of nearly
$6,000,000 and eighty public libraries to the public
school system. It economizes the administration of
the schools by doing away with the necessity for
school libraries, which at the best would fall far short
of the advantages furnished by him.
It is the duty of the metropolis to set a wise and
useful example to other cities, and New York would
xVi; in this duty if it refused to accept the gift offered
to its children. /
But the Sun insists that there is already too much
reading, and that it diverts attention from more se
ricus things. This is an argument for abolition of the
printing press and destruction of books already accu
ir.rlated.
According .to the Sun's views the destroyers of
libraries and not their collectors Â¦ are the real bene
factors of mankind. Its heroes would be the men who
burned the Alexandrian library, and not Ptolemy
Soter, who gathered and housed it. *
We cannot believe that such a reactionary view will
be accepted by New York or indorsed by the coun
trymen of Mr. Carnegie.
London papers report that at the taking of the re
crnt census an y effort was made to have the police
rornd up and count all the vagrants in the city, but as
the vagrants were not informed of the object of rhe
round-up they hid out where the~police co#!d not find
them, and as a consequence the census will show less
than 400 vagrants for the whole city. VJ / 'C

A CHANCE TO SMII*E.
From the conduct of the experienced men and
women who were on the.stage of the Boston Theater
that night the public can learn a profitable lesson if
it have sense enough to. do so. The moral of the
lesson is to avoid interfering in other folks' quarrels.
Let no one undertake to" pronounce judgment for or
against the prima donna, or even suggest a basis for
compromise. It is enough to know, that when the
queen singer is on the stage no one else is to receive
flowers unless they ire sent in by the back door.
Mme. Melba's victory should forever prevent any
further controversy on the subject. . . \\
It will be noted that no one on the stage interfered
in the controversy or offered any -advice in the way
of conciliation. From the impresario, and the stage
manager down j;o the ballet girls arid the supernu
meraries all kept quiet and went right along, each
one attending strictly to his own business. It is evi
dent, therefore, that the whole troupe has learned
wisdom from experience. They are nbt like the fools
who rush in where angels fearto tread and who try
to reconcile contending parties. They are wise in
their generation, and recognizing that the affair was
one 'of high operatic etiquette they left it for Mme.
Melba to settle by the exercise. of her sovereign prima
donna powers. - . . . .
Madame relented . just enough^ to suggest a morsel of
consideration. Said /she, "If - you want to receive the
dowers over the footlights why don't you postpone the
affair and . celebrate^some evening when I am not sing
ing?" : But De Reszke simply smiled. . And so the audi
ence did not know very much about its being the anni
versary of De Reszke's quarter century run on the
grand opera stage. >
And she had her way. M. de Reszke shrugged his
shoulders and said, "Very well; have the flowers sent
around to the stage.''"
Melba wouldn't have It. She got after De Reszke like
this: "I will not allow It. I will not go on the stage
with a man and see him' receive flowers when there are
none for me. If you wish to accept the flowers over the
footlights you must go alone, for I certainly shall not
accompany you." In the meantime the audience was ap
plauding and at the same time Madame Melba was pro
testing. "There is no other star here above me, and I
will not submit to the indignity."
It appears that while singing in that city Edouard
de Reszke" reached the twenty-fifth anniversary, of his
debut on the operatic stage, and his friends and ad
mirers thought it would be a fine thing to -celebrate
the event. Among other forms of celebration" they
a: ranged to present him with such a mass of bouquets
as would make the stage of the Boston Theater look
like a Californian rose festival. The programme was
to have the flowers passed up from the auditorium
across the footlights at the close of scene I of the
third act. De Reszke was aware of the programme
and by way of making it easy for Mme. Melba he
suggested that she come to the stage with him to re
ceive the offering. , The - Madame peremptorily re
fused.
The .story of what took place behind the scenes is
thos told in one of our Eastern exchanges:
\z"l ADAME MELBA has just given the people
/ \ of Boston a lesson in the etiquette of the
stage. /ShÂ£ lias upheld the rights of a prima
donna against an enthusiastic but ill advised attempt
to ignore them, and Boston will know better next
time.

ous combustion was a great theme.
A modern reader of the Aurora of Feb
ruary, 1801, would be surprised to see so
much of its few columns taken up by one
item. There had been a flre in Philadel
phia In a tallow chandler's, and he pub
lished an elaborate explanation of the
cause. A workman had melted up, to
recast, some old candles that in some way
had lost their shape and become fused
together. He strained out the old wicks
from these melted candles and cast them
aside, and these wicks became fired in
some mysterious manner akin to spon
taneous combustion. The chandler pub
lished this relation, also the long and
wordy affidavit of hajf a dozen workmen,
candle-makers, who affirmed that they
had seen flre generated from a similar
cause, and that they gave their testi
mony simply out of kindly Interest in the
world at large, to warn others against
similar loss by fire from a similar cause.
The Fire Plugs of Early Times.
There will occasionally be seen- in the
streets of Eastern* cities the wor^ls "Fire
Plug" cut into a wall or post. Until a
year or two ago (and I presume it is there
still) the inscription "Fire Plug, 26 Feet,"
was cut in the granite wall of the burial
ground In "Washington street, opposite
Rutland street, Boston. These flre plugs
are primitive relics of the old wooden
.aqueduct days when . the water supply
came through a row. of willow logs laid
on either side of the wall from Jamaica
Pond into the heart of Boston. At the
point marked by this inscription there
was a sort of tank formed of oak boards
that would hold about three hogsheads of
water, and in it a small wooden plug was
set. . At an alarm of flre the plug was
drawn and the flre engine tookâ what
water It could get. The words "26 feet"
indicated the force of the water. There
were in all twenty of these fire plugs In
Boston. The word "hydrant" has In gen
eral supplanted the word "plug," though
I am told the latter is still used in some
of our cities. t . Â¦
A Great Fire in New York.
The flre of the Merchants' Exchange
in 1835 was a gi eat crisis in the develop
ment of the city of New York. The water
supply of "the city had been meager and
miserable to an incredible degree. There
were wells, but even "horses refused to
drink the water from them; the water
was full of filth: there was a tea-water
pump which supplied drinking water, then
carried by carts all over the town. There
was a very scant aqueduct system by
which a poor supply of brackish water
was pumped up from wells and carried by
hollow logs through a few streets. After
this disastrous fire the Croton water sys
tem was evolved and perfected. It was
opened with a etreet parade, a formal din
ner, a ball and a concert, at which an
anthem was sung having such verses as
these:
Water leaps, as if delighted.
While her conquered foes retire.
Pale contagion riles, affrighted,
With the baffled demon, Flre.

nance these musters until certain restric
tions were enforced he was threatened
with personal assault and a general riot
seemed inevitable.
When Fire Engines Came Into Use.
When fire engines came into more gen
eral use still more attention was paid to
the formation of flre companies. Small
wages were paid, fire drills were held,
certificates of conduct were given. A cer
tain number manned the rope and each
had duties assigned. When the fire was
over and the engine was again In the en
gine house a roll was called and all ab
sentees were fined. .
"The newspapers had constantly from
persons who had lost property by flre
cards of thanks to ail who had helped
them in their time of need. Thus In 1827
in a Hartford newspaper Enoch Perkins
presented his cordial thanks to the engi
neers, flre wardens and members of ttte
fire society for their assistance at tha flre
at his dwelling place.

There was scant fire Insurance a century
ago. In Philadelphia was "The Philadek
phia Contrlbutorship for the Insurance of
Houses by Lobs by Fire," which is sup
posed to have "been founded by Franklin,
and which, still exists. The rate was 20
shillings on Â£100, the policy running for
seven years. The premium was In the na
ture of a loan, returned at the end of the
term without interest. No house with
shade trees near it would be insured. A
label was tagged to the insured house. A
rival insurance company was started and
took the' distinguishing tag or label of a
tree to affix to the house, since' it insured
tree-embowered houses.
For many years these two Philadelphia
fire insurance companies were the only
ones. It is not known that by 1795 a single
building In Boston was Â¦ insured against
fire." There existed a primitive sort of
mutual insurance, which was another ex
ample of the general helpfulness, the
neighborliness which everywhere existed.
It was. a recognition of the principle that
the loss which is sharp to a single person
falls lightly on many. A citizen whose
house or shop had been destroyed would
send out a paper or publish a notice call
ing attention to his misfortune and ask
ing the assistance of his .fellow-townsmen
on the ground t that- God's hand might
next visit them/and they would need the
help he now implored. These petitions
were not necessarily from those in desti
tute circumstances and It may be assumed
th'at liberal response was given. There
were also friendly societies which carried
out these methods. The Massachusetts
Mutual, the first company in Massachu
setts, was established with the century;
it had some curious rules. If a policy
holder allowed his pump to get out of
order and remain so after his,- attention
had been called to it he had to pay a fine
of $2. He was also fined If his chimney
caught fire. The first fire insurance law
suit in the United States was brought
against this company in 1807.
Caring- for the Firfe Buckets.
Fire rules were rigid enoukh everywhere.
There was a fine of Â£1 for disobeying any
order of the fire warden. If the house
holder could not display to the warden
his fire buckets hanging In good order In
their proper place he was fined. In New
York if the constable fetched home the
fire buckets t.n the owner after the fire
he got 6 shillings apiece for his pains.
This was deemed excessive and it was
more than hinted that the constable hid
them in order to claim the reward. Us
ually the buckets were left in a pile or
set up on fence posts and owners and
their servants came to claim them the fol
lowing day., â¢ Sometimes they were lost by
being put carelessly into the river to be
filled and left to sink to the bottom. So
they were not a cheap accessory to the
household. '
The Old; Volunteer Firemen.
The old volunteer â¢ firemen of the first
half of the nineteenth century were a Ric
turesque and. Inspiring group. All classes
of society, from the wealthy merchant to
the humblest . workman, served under the
volunteer's heavy hat. Men left their
homes to risk their lives for the preserva
tion of the homes of others, and they did
it unasked, and as simply as if they were
walking to church. The fire laddies of
the first salaried companies were made
immortal by Chanfrau on the stage and
through innumerable caricatures in the
press. "Mose" in his red shirt, with black
broadcloth trousers tucked into boottops,
and his distinguishing "soap locks" hang
ing down his shaven cheeks, was a real
character. It is told that in New York
in 1820 there were 500 alarms of fire, so
the companies were never Idle. The fights,
contests of skill, rivalries of love and
"washouts" of the different companies
were episodes of American life, and the
engineer with his trumpet was a hero.
The orgies of 'the firemen's .annual mus
ters grew -to be obnoxious to many law
abiding citizens, and when my father, in
a position of authority, refused to counte-

A further examination of the subject will in most
ir-stances trace this difference in cost^to the con
st'mer to a difference in the cost of the supply which
is reflected in the quality of the water.
Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia, New York and
Boston are the leading large cities of the country which
have a water supply. under public ownership. In each
of them the supply is of very poor quality, and for a
considerable part of each year non-potable and dan
gerous to health. A standing notice is seen daily in
the Chicago papers warping consumers not to use the
city water. This is an official notice, and is con
tinuous throughout the year. The districts where
the water is fatal, where it may be used if boiled,
where it may be used with caution and where it is safe,
are numbered, and the people are put on their guard.
In Washington . City the United States owns the
water supply, and it is probably the worst water,
chemically and physically, that is to be found in the
country. The Philadelphia supply is but little behind
in vileness, and that of New York is so dangerous
that only those use it who have to. In New York
a large number of people make a profitable business
of supplying pure water from a large spring that flows
near the Harlem mere, which is sold at ten cents a
pail.
In Boston the spring water wagons peddle pure
water just as milk is peddled in cities. If these water
plants were in corporate ownership the people,
through the authority of Government control, would
compel the filtering and purifying of the water, as is
done wherever the supply needs it.
Making the water uniformly fit and safe for us?
adds to its cost and may account for a large part of
the two and a half cents a day which it costs in ex
cess of the unfiltered and unfit public supply. To
point out these things is not opposition to public
ownership, but it is the giving of proper information,
which the people should have.
In order to have a complete view the vital statis
tics of cities should be considered; Zymotic diseases
are influenced by water supply, and if they are more
pievalent and' more fatal in the public ownership
cities where an unfit supply is furnished it will be
readily seen that in the cost of sickness the small mat
ter of two and a hajf cents a day is wiped out.
The ownership of water, light and railway plants
is a business proposition, whether public or private,
and the public should give it the same careful fore
thought that is expected from a private investor.
SUPERVISO R REED somewhat mistakes the
attitude of The Call upon the question of rmmi
. cipal ownership. of public service industries.
The proponents of that policy have held the front of
the stage and have done all the educating of public
opinion on the, subject. The opponents are, natu
rally, thepresent owners of those industries, who arc
temporarily intrenched behind franchises that have
various periods to run. Between the two are the tax
paying and ratepaying people, who are finally to de
cide the issue, and'with whom is the public opinion
which is to influence the decision.
1 As far afc The Call is concerned it feels no other in
terest than oViginates in' a desire to enlighten pub
lic opinion. It cannot be said that the advocates of
public ownership have .been nicely scrupulous nor
exact in' their, statement of facts. They have widely
published that the profits of municipal ownership of
street railways and wafer supply pay all the cost of
government in Glasgow and relieve the people en
tirely of taxation. This statement was made by
Mayor Phelan, doubtless upon authority of that pub r
lication. Nothing can go farther to, influence public
opinion favorably to the proposition.* But, upon in
quiry we found the statement to be untrue. We found
that in addition to all the revenue derived from her
public service industries the people of Glasgow are.
taxed a trifle higher than the rate in San 'Francisco
and Oakland. Therefore, if the people of this city
were induced to adopt public ownership in the belief
that they would be free from taxation they would act
under a deception, and in the reaction which would
follow might abandon 4 he policy of public ownership,
as the people of Philadelphia did in respect, to the
lighting of that city.
Again, we deprecate a policy of spoliation intended
to destroy the capital invested in* public service in
dustries, which is too often the motive of its advo
cates. In that connection we have pointed out that
in Europe wherever public ownership is adopted the
existing plants have been taken' over at a valuation
that does not despoil' the stockholders and destroy
thtii capital.. The destruction of capital is not a sound
public policy. "To oppose it is not opposing public
ownership, but is removing from that policy the spirit
of revenge and reprisal which is, unfortunately, too
apparent in its advocates.
Mr. Reed makes the argument of greater cheapness
of a public water supply, quoting the statistics gath
eied by the Merchants' Association of New York.
The average cost in the United States for water per
family is $21 55 per annum for the public supply, and
$.30 82 for the private jor corporate supply, a differ
ence in favor of public ownership of two cents and
five mills per day. x

> From these combined explorations we may expect
many of the secrets of the great southern continent to
be revealed, and doubtless from the revelations science
will know how to derive a profit that will repay the
cost and the labor to attain it. Pole-searching is not
now the dangerous adventure it was in the days of
Sir John Franklin, and, moreover, it is not being
conducted for the same purposes. Franklin and the

The spring: publishing: season fs now be
ginning In earnest. Thu year there Is
some talk of extending .the season well
into the summer. Mr. Helnemann haa
again chosen August for the publication
of Hail Caine's new novel. Dull as things
have been, dull as has been the outlook,
booksellers are now anticipating a brisk
market till at least the end of June. "V/e
want Americans over to wake us up," re
marked a "West End bookseller the other
day. Americans seem to be large boalc
buyers when they come to London."
One feature of the season is the enor
mous output of sixpenny reprints of. popu
lar novels. Publishers have been selling
these paper-covered editions literally by
hundreds of thousands. Messrs. Cassell.
for instance, have calculated that thirteen
of their sixpenny editions have sold a
million and a quarter copies. The secret
of their success, of course, is that tha
popularity of each book has previously
been tested in the more expensive form.
Among the new bocks which have re
cently run into second editions are Chur
ton Collins* "Ephemera CriUca. Lady
Hodgson's "Siege of Kumasi." FrankBuL
len's "Sack of Shavings"' and Barry Pain s
"Another Englishwoman's Love Letters.

unusual run in this country, where It if
being published both by Fisher Lnwlnand
Grant Richards, is Irving BacheUer â¢
Eben Holden," Unwln's alone having

Messrs. Methuen's most successful novel
of the year is Miss Findlater's "A Narrow
Way," which will shortly reach Its third
edition. Mrs. Croker's "State Secret and
Mrs. Dudeny's "The Third Floor.' also
published by the Messrs. Methuen. are la

a compromising nature that the tag in
question can only be opened by Joint con
sent of the sovereign, the Lord Chancellor
and the Archbishop of Canterbury. ThÂ«
statement evidently was made In good
faith, but the Athenaeum, commenting on
the subject, says: "Those who are cuiu
ous in such matters will perhaps feel in-\
clined to speculate on the possible* con
nection of this legend with the title of thÂ»
medieval "Baga de Secretis' and with the
famous casket of letters and miscellane
ous collection of state papers known as
King William Ill's chest, which has late
ly been described in ihe new Home OracÂ« â¢

Even so, the association of the "sovereign

referred to seems to savor somewhat or
Gilbertian humor. The story no doubt Is
of foreign origin."

Supervisor Jennings is authority for the
statement that the Finance* Committee, of
which he is chairman, has practically de
cided to pay only 50 per. cent of the old
debts of the city contracted under former
administrations. Jennings believes :that
the constitutional amendment recently
adopted and providing for the payment of
the old claims gives the board discretion
ary power in the matter of settling them.
This action is in' consonance with the rec
ommendation of Auditor Wells, made some
time ago, that the claims be pro rated.
Wells states, however, that there are final
judgments against the city amounting to
$80,000, and these must be pafd in full. The
teachers are included in the pro rata
proposition, and it is quite likely that all
the city's creditors will obtain final judg
ments to secure the full amount . of their
claims.

, The only way In which the. displacement
of teachers assigned to regular classes
may be avoided "will be for tho board to
net favorably on tho recommendation ot
Superintendent Webster that thirty addi

not disposed to look kindly on the sug
gestions of the Superintendent'* office and
that the Supervisors are disposed to cut

of the School Department makes the pos
sibility of additional teachers a remote
one. The board announces, however, that
in no event will the salaries of the tpach

The growing popularity of : the bicycle Is
chiefly beyond doubt due to the fact that It
meets so perfectly the wants of the American
people of all classes.' The business man, \ the
health seeker, the clergyman and physician,
and lovers of outdoor exercise, all find In, It
what they need. No other invention ever had
in it so many elements to win popular favor.
But the price at which it is now offered to
the public removes the only obstacle that ever
existed to its universal . adoption by the
people as a whole. Its . moderate cost puts it
within the reach of all, even of those of a very
limited income. The popular response . to this
Btate of things is truly astonishing. Every
manufacturer Is busy, and new agencies are
being established everywhere. There is no
""boom," but a legitimate ; expansion Â¦ ot Â¦. the
business in . response to an actual and vast
increase . in ; the demand. The price settles it.
The people of the whole country have discov

know . there is no pleasanter, more ; effective
means of obtaining. the exercise they . require,
and that Is why the supply can barely equal

of the way so that he will not appear
and prosecute the case against them.
When the case was called in Judge
Fritz's court yesterday their attorney
asked for a continuance till Tuesday, ex
plaining that Berry was going to Fresno
and would not return till'then. The JudgÂ«
granted the continuance, and after fixing
the men's bonds in $1000 or $500 cash trans
ferred the case to Judge Cabaniss'
court. Fritz will be out of the city next
week. v
When Captain Seymour learned of the
long continuance he came to the conclu
sion that a scheme was on foot to get
Berry out of the way, and he waited
upon Judge Cabaniss and asked him that
The bonds be increased. The application
ivas strongly opposed by Attorney Mack
but the Judge decided to take no chance3
and increased the bonds to $2000 or $1003
cash In each case. Berry has promise 1
to be on hand Tuesday to prosecute the
case.

Mrs. Macondray could not be seen at
the residence of her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Richardson, last night, "but her
nother discussed the rumored story of
iivorce freely. She said:
"The papers in the suit have not been
lied yet, but will be within a few days.
: am very sorry that the matter has been
riven so much publicity, but now that
t is known I have no objections to tell
ng the story of the troubles of my
laughter and her husband. The troubles
jriginated a short, time after the. mar
*iage and are due- to Mr. Macondray's
nsane jealousy. Hardly had they arrived
n the Philippines when we heard that
:hey were coming back. The reason for
:he return -was that the newly made
:ouple could not agree.
"They resided here with us for a time,
ind several times we were compelled to
nterfere to preserve peace. They then
eft us and went to a boarding-house, but
;heir disagreements still continued.
fVbout two months ago my daughter
:ame back to us and Mr. Macondray
went to live at his home. Under the cir
cumstances we thought it better to ask
[or a legal separation, and in a few days
the papers will be filed.
"There will be no contest, as near as I
can understand, and we were in hops
that the divorce could be procured witn
out this notoriety.
"The rumor that Mr. Macondray in
tended at one time taking the initiative is
all bosh. He could have no reason for
desiring a legal separation from my
daughter. The cause for the divorce has
been furnished by Mr. Macondray. His
Insane jealousy is simply cruelty, and his
wife has stood it long enough."
In the Divorce Court.
Decrees of divorce were granted Wednes
day to Annie A. Byrne from J. W. Byrne
for extreme cruelty, Sarah E. Simpson
from' Angus W. Simpson for â¢ desertion,

THE sea of matrimony has provid
ed other than smooth sailing- for
the bark of yountf Arthur Macon
dray, which, though launched but
eight months ago, Is all but
wrecked from the buffetings and tosslnga
it has received.
Within a few days divorce papers win
be served and the law* of the State util
ized to sever the bonds that have brought
nothing but unhappiness to Macondray
and hi* bride, who was formerly MlssÂ»
Madge Richardson, vi '
Maeondray ancl Miss Richardson wre
married less than a, year as*, despite
strenuous objections of their parents, and
their troubles commenced shortly a-ftet
the ceremony was performed. Their
honeymoon trip Included a voyage to the
Orient, where younsr Maeondray was
*lated for a position in thft forctcn
branch of the- house rt Macondmy * Co.
Little la known of the happenings of tho
Irlp across the ocean, but within a month
after their arrival word was received that
thÂ« newly wedded couple w&a bound for
this city. They arrived he 1 *Â© and took up
their residence with the parents of the
bride at 109 Frederick street. Hardly had
they become settled when people were
startled by the rumor that the young hue.
band had attempted suicide. The rumor
was denied and all seemed ecrcno until the
story of the prospective divorce was made
public yesterday. . Â¦." '
Mrs. Macondray will be the plaintiff
and her grounds, as seated In the papera
now under preparation, is cruelty.
Last night Cannon went to the Lombard
street house and found that it had been
stripped of all its furnishings, and that
Mrs. Jacques- was at the St. Nicholas Ho
tel. He met only the deaf and dumb at
tendant, and after displaying an order of
court succeeded in locating Jacques. The
lawyer questioned him in regard to the
expenditure of O'Hare's money, and was
told that it had been used In the purchase
of the Lombard street and other prop
erty. Jacques finally refused to talk fur
ther, and Cannon, believing that he was
about to leave the State, as the. vacated
house would indicate, had the warrants
issued. Thus far the police have not suc
ceeded In finding the aged man.
On January 1 of this year Cannon found
that O'Hare had $12,000 on deposit in the
German Savings Bank. After $2400 had
loen drawn out the balance was made
payable to the old man or Jacques' son.
The latter closed the account and drew
out ?S0O0 on March 29. Recently $8000 has
been drawn by the son from the Hibernia
Bank, but the old man was present at the
time. This, with the exception of some
real estate, is all of O'Hare's property
that Cannon has yft been able to locate.
Mrs. Gowdy has repeatedly tried to see
her brother. He disappeared in Febru
ary and did not return until a few days
ago. In the meantime the Jacques fam
ily had communicated with O'Hare's other
Fisters in the East and urged her recall.
Attorney Cannon then commenced pro
ceedings for the guardianship of the aged
and incompetent man in Judge Coffey's
court, but failed in the serving of cita
tions. Jacques claimed that O'Hare had
been taken East by one of his other sis
ters and the Judge ordered him to appear
for contempt of court.
Mrs. A. Gowdey of Brcoklyn. O'Hare's
Fister. came to the coast last winter for
the purpose of taking: her brother East
and enrine for him for the remainder of
his life. She claims that age had robbed
him of his mind nnd that he was incompe
tent to manage his own cifairs. She re
tained Attorney W. M. Cannon and the
unsuccessful efforts of the two in even
meeting her relative occasioned the Issu
ance of the felony warrants.

YOU CAN BE BEAUTIFUL!
Every woman wants to be and can be beautifulâ
if she will. It's not only an honest desire but a duty
each owes herself and to the world at large.
MME. IDALINE'S FACE CREAM
a perfectly harmless compound of vegetable sub-
stances, beautifies at onceâ showing no trace of its ap-
plication, while giving that softness and delicacy of
complexion, like the bloom of the peach, which we all
love to see. All face powders contain chemicals and
all other face creams contain grease and are a con-
stant menace to the skin and its clearness and beauty.
Ask your druggist or bend 50c and we will mail it to you.

tome damage Â«to the reproductive system,
caused by a contracted disorder or early dissi-
pation. In looking for the location of this dam-
age we generally nnd un enlarged, swollen and
Inflamed prostate glaml. As this gland Is the
very center of the reproductive system It can
readily be understood that Inflammation of It
must cause disordered function. These cases
are promptly benefited by proper treatment,
otherwise the patient goes from bad to worse.
The essential point In all of them Is the neces-
sity of the cure of the focus of the trouble in
the prostate. Many men have unsuccessfully
treated for a weakness and become discour-
aged, when. If an antiphlogistic plan of treat-
ment had been adopted Instead of tonics, a
euro would have been the result. In our ex-
perience there Is no druff in the Pharmacopoea,
taken into the stomach, that will even benefit
this class of cases. Our plan of treatment Is
entirely a local one, anu prompt results are ob-
tained, as Indicated by increased circulation
and return of natural vigor. Our colored chart,
which we mail on application, is interesting to

NEW TORK. April 18.â The promise of a
good bank statement on Saturday and the fur
ther relaxation in the money market which
resulted were the main motives in the renewed
speculative buying of stocks to-day. The move
ment of prices was exceedingly irregular and
profit taking was on a very heavy scale. The
reawakening of speculation was not achieved
without aggressive leadership by the profes
sional element, who called to their assistance
&11 the arts of manipulation to move prices up
ward, so as to afford the requisite attraction
to the cutside speculative world. While they
were developing new points of strength they
or their professional brethren were actively
Bell.ng to take prottts in the recently exploited
etocks. The influence was etUI manliest of
a lailure to announce the terms of the Bur
lington deal and also of the, suggestion coming
from St. Paul that 1'resident J. J. Hill had
6old out his holdings of Erie ttock at a specu
lative profit and that no great transcontinental
system was projected. The Erie stocks. Bur
lington. Northern Pacific and the Grangers gen
erally were affected by these considerations
early in the day. The active profit taking in
Amalgamated Copper and in Sugar were also
influences on the tide of depression. Sugar
was temporarily strong because of the advance
in the price of the refined product after the
market had closed last night, but sagged away
In a characteristic manner on the news later
in the day. Its depression was emphasized by
the heavy import duty levied upon refined
sugar in the British budget. Amalgamated
copper, on the other hand, scored practically a
complete recovery of its lots in the late deal
ings. The most effective leaders of the market
were Atchiton and Union Pacific. The deal
ings in both were on a very heavy scale and
a professional campalgifVor a rise was clearly
being: conducted In both. The irosBip to ac
count for the rise was that Atchison was to
be placed on a 4 per cent dividend basis and
that Pennsylvania interests were to be repre
eemed in the directory as a result of the al
l< ged acquisition of a large interest . by Penn
sylvania in the company. In Union Pacific it
was eaid .that the Southern Pacific collateral
bonds were to be redeemed, thus releasing the
Central Pacific stock, and that Union Pacific
was to co-operate with Northwestern in the
fcrmation of a transcontinental system to offset
the Burlington deal. Atchison enjoyed an ex
treme advance of 2 T i as a result of these ma
neuvers and Union Pacific was lifted 2',i.
There were other advances among the South
western and Southern railroads, which were
largely, sympathetic. New York Central, the
Cleveland, C. C and St. Louis stocks Canada
Southern and New York. Chicago and St. LouU
etocks advanced from 1%-to 3^ in sympathy
and Pittsburg. C. C. and St. Louis rose 4*4
over last night In sympathy. The New York
public utilities had their period of strength, as
fiid a number of other specialties, notably Colo
redo Fuel. Tennessee Coal, New York Mr
Krake. Pacific Coast and United States Ex
press., the latter on. the election as directors of
o.ficlals of other express companies. The gains
in this lot. of FtocJcs ran from about 3 to 10
points. The relaxation in the money market
had the greater effect since there was no re
fpr-nsive hardening of the sterling exchange
rater. The weekly statement of the Bank of
Enpland in fact makes It . clear that the pre
paratory earing of the money ~ market there
lor the coming loan has already commenced
c^rr- la^ e ln : rea(:e ln th * P u bÂ»c deposits of
$ll.CCo,COO reflects the heavy clearances of
Fucar and other goods in anticipation of the
new taxes In the budpet. Hea\-y disbursements
of public deposit* will doubtless be incident of
the period preceding the loan In order to ease
the money market. The budget speech was re
ceived too late in Wall street to attract much
â¢mention, but the decision for a $300 000 000
loan, which is equal to the maximum esti
mates, is bound to be a potent factor in thÂ«
future of the New York money market.

CHICAGO, April IS.â Allegations of frost In
Kansas and . other portions of the Southwest
stimulated the wheat market at the start, al
though it was recognizsd that frost is not good
medicine for insects, which seem ' to be about
the only present blot on the generally rosy crop
outlook. The climatic conditions, however,
combined with steady cables and small North
west receipts, was enuugh to alarm nervous
shorts. This Interest ani some outsiders bought
at the opening, when May sold from 71c to
71 %c, an advance of >4@%c over yesterday" s
close. â¢- During the first hour.it reacted to 70%c.
Large export engagements caused the shorts
to cover and May advanced to 71%c. Profit
taking sales caused a reaction from this to
70%c. The close was firm, May '54@%c higher
at -71@71%c. "' :.-. Â¦ - .
The corn market waa a professional affair
Bull leaders apparently did not care to have
it advance a point to a level where it would
be an object to detain, corn-laden boats in the
harbor to . deliver their cargoes on May con
tracts. May closed Vit(Z*%c lower at 43%@44c.
Selling of May and buying July was .the
feature of a quiet session in the oats market.
May closed He lower at 25%c.
Provisions had anotlTtr dull day. The cash
situation was easier and 'pork and lard eased
off a trifle in consequence, but ribs held steady.
The range was. narrow. . May pork closed 5c
lower, lard 2"&c down and ribs unchanged.

"WHEATâ Liverpool was higher and Paris
lower. ' . " .;
Chicago opened firmer and a sha.de higher on
unfavorable weather and unsatisfactory crop
news from the Southwest, which set the bears
to covering. The local demand was light, save
for the heavy buying of May by a large short.
The market appeared oversold. Uncertainty as
to proposed tax measures in Parliament is be
coming a factor in Liverpool. The Cincinnati
Price Current says the growth of the crop is
slow, but that its condition is favorable. Min
neapolis expects a decrease in' stocks for the
week of 700,000 bushels.

Latest mall advices from New. York say:
"There is very little buying in this market of
prunes from the coast at the new prices, the
number of cars sold tluce the reduction was
made being variously estimated at from seven
to twenty. Many believe the lower estimate
nearer the correct one. It is understood on
very good authority that coast prices are be
ing virtuclly cut about 5 per cent under the
association basis on Santa Claras, and some
business is stated to have been done at VÂ»c
under en Sonoma goods.
"Prunes on the spot are meeting with quite
a steady trade at about %@*Â»c above the
equivalent of the coant basis on large sizes
and about above orÂ» small sizes. Goods to
arrive in a lew days may be had at lees prices,
and thfre are reports that some holders of
goods about due are offering on the exact asso-
Prunes and Raisins in New York.

Congressman Kahn was the principal
speaker at an enthusiastic meeting. held
last night under the auspices of the Nuevo
Potrero Improvement Club in Rasmus
sen's Hall on Rhodes Island street. Mr.
Kahn spoke of the needs of the district
and stated that he wou'd advocate at the
next session of Congress a bill to appro
priate a sum for the investigation by the
United States engineers of Islals Creek to
determine whether it can be used for har
bor purposes. He also spoke of the oppo
sition manifested in Hawaii against the
deportation to the islands of the lepers
now in this country. He wilt suggest that
the lepers be moved to some island on the
coast where they can be kept in seclusion.
Peter Stalberg presided at the meeting,
which was also addressed by Supervisor
Dwyer, Max Popper and M. Roundey,
president of the Federation of Mission Im
provement Clubs.

Woman Member of the Library Board
Expresses Opinion on' Contro
. . versy Over Appointments.
ALAMEDA, April 18.â "Those men can
resign of they want to, but I'm going to
stay in this fight to the last ditch. , If
they think so much of Mr. Bowers- and
deem him indisDehsable to the Board of
Library- Trustees, why don't one of the
four of them withdraw- in- his v favor?
There's. nothins to stop them. And even
If they do all withdraw, why I guess there
are enough people in this town to fill their
places. All this talk seems to me a little
bit inconsistent.
"As for the statement that our appoint
ments : were illegally made, just because
Chairman Forderer did not make them
personally, I think that is drawing things
pretty fine. Wasn't Mr. Forderer present
when the appointments were made and
didn't he acquiesce in everything that was
done? Well. then, that ought to be suffi
cient It was just as if the president of
the board had done It personally. The law
was strictly obeyed. These technicalities
have been brought to light simply because
a mistake was made and they want to get
me out." ' ' ' .
These are the sentiments of Mrs. I. N.
Chapman on the Library Board question
which is agitating the Alameda common
wealth. ..Mrs. Chapman is what is known
as a "spunky little woman." She is one
of the kind that stand" by their guns to
the last, else she wouldn't be, probably; a
contender for universal suffrage. She will
not be pushed off the Library Board with
out a struggle, as can-be inferred from
her remarks about four men.
City Attorney M. W; Simpson has given
it as his opinion, that the action of the
Citv Trustees Monday night : when each,
made an appointment of a Library Trus
tee is not according to the provisions of
the new library law. Former City Attor
ney-Taylor concurs '.with him. â¢ The four
male members of the Library Board have
said all they are going to say for a while.
MRS. CHAPMAN WILL STAY

To-day's action is based upon the action
of Wilson in liring three shots into the
Scouler home in Corte Madera at 9 o'clock
last Tuesday night. To-day the Scoulers
refused to prosecute Wilson. They be
lieve that he meant to do them.no harm.
James R. McCue, however, who lives ion
adjoining property, does not intend to
drop the matter so easily. He contends,
as do the officers who have investigated

The prospective battle between the late
Volr.ey D. Moody's children, their step
mother and her daughters over the distri
bution of the dead man's fortune has given
rise to many gossipy stories about the
strained relationship which existed be
tween the family factions during the life
time of the pioneer banker. But the prime
I cause of dissatisfaction above all of the
property Interests themselves is the ob
jection the three children.' W. C. Moody,
Mrs. Jessie L. Appleton and Mrs. "Wil
liam F. Blood, make to the way their
father arranged for the distribution of
their stepmother's? two-fifths portion of
the estate. # .s
According to the will, Mrs. Mary S.
Gray and Mrs. Robinson; Moody's step
daughters, will come in for that bulky
part of the property their mother Is to
receive. Special provision was made in
the will that in the event Mrs. Moody No.
2 died before her husband all he Intended
to give her .should go to her daughters.
Now, after she dies, in the event the two
daughters survive, her share will go to
them.
According to the children's point of
view, therefore, two strangers with no
claim of blood relationship whatever are
to phare in a fortune that they, the off
spring, believe should be their- portion.
This is one of the chief bones of con
tention in the disturbance that has caused
so much friction in the Moody families.
It is doubly a source of complaint in the
eyes of the children because they are con
vinced that the share of the estate de
vised to the stepmother is very much
greater than the fractional two-fifths
nominated in the will. This is due, claim
the trio, to the many specific allotments
of property which , were made to Mrs.
Mcody by deed before her husband's
death and then by confirmation in the
will.
It is practically settled that there will
be a strong effort made to adjust matters
out of court. The hearing of he execu
tors' petition for letters testamentary Is
sot for Monday, but a 'continuance will
undoubtedly be requested in order that
the attorneys may meet together.
William F. Blood, the son-in-law, who
resides In Oakland, expects that there
will be a conference on Saturday between
the lawyers and that the situation will
then be reviewed. Although the purpose
is to reach a settlement out of court and
to avoid the litigation which must open a
long campaign, the existing ill feeling be
tween the branches of the capitalist's
family is an acknowledged obstacle to the
accomplishment of that end.

hearing a voice, she appeared. Seeing her

"The growing necessity to California
fruit-growers," writes Mr. Goodwin, "for
advices in regard to the conditions . of
competing markets -and crops In Europe
will be apparent when It is known that
the shipments from this State have
grown by. leaps. and bounds, so that they
are to-day the controlling Interests In
this country and are competing . for the
trade in foreign markets." A table of
fruit shipments from California is In
cluded. â¢ The letter then continues as fol
lows: ' . .' / -. *
If prompt and fairly accurate Information
on the . lines suggested can . be furnished the
handlers of our fruits they will be in a much
better position to market their products ad
vantageously, not only in the United States
but abroad, where there is being developed a
constantly increasing and broader market. It
the plans outlined meet with the approval of
the State Department and the consular offices
at the points named are Instructed to furnish
the desired information each year I have the
honor to suggest that their mail and cable ad
vices be transmitted to the Pacific Commercial
Museum at the earliest possible date after their
receipt by the department and the museum will
make it its duty to place the information before
all interested parties in California.
It will be apparent to the department that
one of the chief elements of value of this ser
vice will be the promptness of its origin and
of its. transmission to this Institution, and the
suggestion is therefore offered that cable ad
vices be repeated by -telegraph to us.. If It
should be developed after a fair trial that
consular officers are unable to obtain infor
mation on the - lines suggested we would be
glad to be advised thereof, accompanied by a
statement from the Consuls of the difficulties
surrounding the acquirement of the desired in
formation.
The questions proposed provide for In
formation concerning the prospects for
the prune crops, together with the stocks
on hand from about June 1 to June 15;
for advices about July 1 to July 15 as to
whether the crops are fulfilling the ear
lier predictions, and for cable advices
concerning the crops as soon as the
sales of a new crop have begun. Thesa
queries apply to the ' Consuls at Bor
deaux, Belgrade and Budapest. Cable
advices are also asked for from. Ham
burg, u soon as the new crop of Euro
pean prunes reaches that market. Cablo
advices are to be supplemented with
communications by mail. Questions of
similar character are propounded con
cerning lemons, to be answered by the
Consuls at Catania, Messina, Palermo
and Sorrento, and concerning raisins, to
be replied to by Consuls at Malaga, Va
lencia and Almeria, The foreign walnut
market, it is suggested, can be covered
by information from Consuls at Mar
seilles, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Sorrento,
Budapest and Havre.. ' ; â¢ *
The- Commercial Museum, by. Director
Eugene Goodwin, has forwarded | to the
Secretary of State at Washington a se
ries of inquiries on the markets and

SEEKING FACTS
FOR FRUIT MEN
day. The . plaintiff seeks to recover a
Â£5000 commission for procartng: the Duka
a loan of Â£10,000. The defense pleaded
that the terms of the loan were unreason
able. Mr. Zimmerman, the father-in-law
of - the Â¦ Duke, was In court. Sangulnettt
testified that the Duke said he wanted;
Â£500 in connection with a marriage, that
he had insured his Ufa for Â£30.000 and that
he was making a pood income as corre
spondent for a New Tork paper. The>
plaintiff admitted that he charged 25 per
cent yearly Interest, which, he said, was
not exorbitant.
After evidence that the Manchester es
tates In England and Ireland showed a
yearly deficit and that the income did not
suffice to meet the mortgages, charges
and jointures of the Dowager Duchesses
Judpment was given in favor of the de
fendant on the ground that Sangulnettl
had never found any one able or willing
to provide the loan on which he claimed
commission on the actual security avail
able.
Duke Said He Needed Money
Â¦ in Connection With
a Marriage.

yesterday -before United States .Court

against . t#s\< doctor .was 'boarding the
British ship Saint "Bede against the
orders of Customs Inspector Hans Meier,
and that against the pilot was interfer
ing with the inspector in the discharge of
his -duties. Â¦ The * evidence was that the
doctor did not board the ship, but merely
stood on the ladder at the rail, and that
Kortz, instead of demanding that the doc
tor should be allowed to board the. vessel,
had' shouted to the doctor that 'he could
not come on board. It was shown also. that
Daniel O'Callaghan was allowed to go. on
beard and remained there an hour before
Dr. .McDonald made his appearance. >
Both cases were dismissed after Attor

their evidence. .
The transport Warren came off Hunters

Folsom-street wharf. Before being taken
off the drydock there was an accident, in
which two men were badly injured, sev
eral received, slight wounds and the 7C0
workmen aboard got a scare they will not
forget in a hurry. The big transport was
ready to be taken out of the dock and the
water to float her was being let in. The
bow rose before the stern, and the blocks
slipping from under the latter the steam
ship gave a lurch and the next .instant
went over to-starboard. She partially re
covered herself and then went over again
to an angle of 45 degrees,: and. remained
in that position for a half-hour. '
"When the "Warren gave her first. plunge
a connecting rod *broke loose and pinned
Aaron Astill, an electrician, to the side of
the ship, breaking his ankle. The main
binder also broke loose and struck Ben
Hall, a bollerrr.aker, crushing his hip.
Several men were knocked off the cylinder
head and received scalp wounds. After
the second lurch it did not take five min
utes t<J clear the ship, nnd some of the
bollermakers and machinists did not stop
running until they were safe among the
hills. -Over 400 of > them refused to make
the trip down the bay on the vessel and

fy Trewhella. - â¢ \ Â¦ -
Coming down to the day of the shoot
ing. Glare testified that he had gone down
town on business, and had also gone to a
gunstore to purchase cartridges for the
revolver he always carried. .- . ...
Glaze again detailed his doings on the
day of the shooting, and told how he had
gone to look for his partner in the after
noon tn order to pet him to sign certain
papers, and that on entering the old bak
ery of the hotel, Trewhella had entered by
the opposite door and with a threat had
told the witness he would kill him. Glaze
repeated the same testimony as given yes
terday of the way in which he pulled his
pistol and fired, thinking his life was in
danger. Â¦ Â¦ . -
Glaze stated that on .the morning of the
shooting Trewhella had made threats to
kill him and had placed his hand on a big
butcher's cleaver, but that he, Glaze,, had
walked away, although at the time he had
a loaded pistol in his possession. 'The
cross-examination of Glaze did not pro
duce anything different to the story he
had told on direct examination. â¢
A number of witnesses were called .by
the prosecution <to impeach the testimony
of the witness Aron, who claimed that
Trewhella had made threats to kill Glaze
because he had paid a business account.
All the witnesses stated that Aron was
not to be believed under oath and that his
reputation was bad as regarded truth. '
F. M. Black was called by the prosecu
tion to testify to threats made by Glaze
against Trewhella on various occasions.
Ah Jim, a Chinese cook, testified to see
ing Trewhella and the bellboy, O'Connor,
near the table in the kitchen on the day
of the shooting. - The witness testified
that he was close to Trewhella and O'Con
nor before the shooting, but did not hear
Trewhella say anything previous , to the
shots beinc fired. . \ -
Mrs. Trewhella, widow, of the man killed
by Glaze, was called by the prosecution
and contradicted the evidence given by
Mrs. Glaze as to the trouble on the night
of January 13 at the .Windsor Hotel." Mrs.
Trewhella stated that Mrs. Glaze came
to her rooms in an intoxicated state and
created a scene, and that Mr. Trewhella
had grntly placed his hand? on her and
asked her to leave the rooms.

TRIAL OF GLAZE
NEARS ITS END
Pathetic Scene Occurs
When Blind Witness
Testifies.;
A letter has been written by Secretary
of State Curry that is Interesting the un
derwriters of this city and will concern all
foreign corporations that intend *o engage
in business in this State. The letter was
received by Baggs & Stovel and was
called out by correspondence concerning
the addition of three foreign insurance
corporations. At the, last session of the
Legislature a law was enacted that was
devised to affect principally the numerous
oil companies in the State that were go
ing to Arizona to incorporate, and it was
calculated to bring the State a consider
able sum In money for fees for filing pa
pers at Sacramento relating to incorpora
tion, such fees to be paid to the Secretary
of; State. In his letter Secretary of State
Curry says to the underwriters:
My construction of the law Is that all for
eign cnrDoratlons dolns business in the State
that. have failed to comply with the regulations
requiring foreign corporations to file in this
ofnee a deslgnaticn of agent prior to the pas
sage of the act requiring them to file certi
fied copies of their articles of incorporation
must comply with the act approved March 8.
1901. and pay therefor the same fees as do cor
poratiens formed under the laws of this State.
In other words. I do not understand that th*
prwisiens of section 3 of the act. approved
March s. 1901, should be construed that foreign
corporations . have forty days in which to file
their designation of agent, hut that the mean
ing is that they must comply with the act In
relation to foreign corporations.
The law has set up a scale of fees for
filing the articles of Incorporation of for
eign corporations, which range from $15 to
$150, the latter fee being for a company
having a capital of more than 11,000.000.
Air trusts that come hereafter to the
State and all large corporations from
abroad, organized under the laws of New
Jersey or any other locality favored by in
corporatorc. that wish to begin in the fu
ture to do business tn California will have
to pay a fee under the new law. The ag
gregate of these fees will be quite large
In the course of a year.

tramps and others from the building. But
when the firemen reached the place last
night there was no evidence that any one
had been in the building. Mrs. Kelly, the
recently appointed janitress, declares that
she did not remove any ashes from the
stoves in the building yesterday after
noon. . The barrels Â¦ in which the ashes
should have been placed are situated us
ually some distance from the place where
the fire apparently originated. An inves
tigation into the matter is now being con
ducted by Fire Marshal Towe. ' '
Burnett School was built in the 'latter
partof the sixties or the early part of
the seventies, during the incumbency of
present School Director James Denman as
Superintendent of Schools. The building
was originally an eight-class building but
was later, transformed into a twelve-class
schoolhouse owing to. the demands *f in
creasing population. Since then its scope
has been extended by the renting of out
side classrooms. . :
v After over thirty years of usefulness, the
building has outgrown its original pur
poses. There has been an' agitation on
foot through many successive Boards of
Education to replace the ancient struc
ture with one built on more modern ideas
All these efforts have failed through "dol
lar limits" and other causes. Six hun
dred children are crowded into rooms de
signed for less than half that number.
At the reauest of Mrs. . Kincaid, School
Director Benman signed an authorization
for . Principal W. W. Stone to have the
damage to the building repaired at an ex
pense of $50.
AFIRE neculiar at least in its or
â¢ igin occurred shortly before 7
o'clock yesterday morning in the
Burnett Primary School, at Four,
teenth . avenue, near_. Railroad
avenue south: A few minutes before the
alarm was turned in Mrs. Franks, who
resides in the neighborhood, saw smoke
coming out of the school building. Other
residents in the neighborhood also saw
the signs of fire and an alarm was quickly
turned in. Â¦ , â¢
No time was lost in extinguishing the
incipient blaze. Its origin was traced to
a room in the basement, -where the coal
is stored and the garbage barrels are lo
cated. The fire ate its way through the
partitions to the upper floor, entailing a
damage estimated not to exceed $50. The
alarm spread consternation through the
district, and out of 600 pupils attending
the school only 100 were present when the
roll was called in the morning. Â¦" ., .
All kinds of conjectures are being ad
vanced sfe to the origin of the'fire. Dur
ing the afternoon the only fires j used in
the building were those needed for heat
ing -water for luncheon. These fires were
not disturbed until several hours after
the school had closed for the day, so that
the coals in all the stoves had ample time
to 'cool.
On several previous occasions the po
lice attached to the South San Francisco
police station' have been called to eject
