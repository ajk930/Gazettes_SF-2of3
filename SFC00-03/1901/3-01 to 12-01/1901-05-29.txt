AMERICAN industries will bs in

business men,' if the decisions of
the Supreme Court of the United
States in the Porto Rico cases
are applied to importations from the
Philippines. President George A. New
hall of the Cakmber of Commerce says
that all commercial bodies on the Pacific
Coast will undoubtedly seek legislation by
Congress if they find the Interests of ten
coast or of the United States menaced.
The hope of the business community of
San Francisco appears to be that the
Treasury Department will continue to col
lect duties on all dutiable Imports from
the Philippines until Congress can meet
and adopt the necessary protective tariff.
This morning The Call presents tht.
views of San Francisco merchants and
also an important interview with Frank
lin Brooks, correspondent at Manila of
the Associated Press and the .founder of
The American, a newspaper published
. there. Mr. Brooks furnishes interesting
facts concerning conditions in the Philip
pines, which are not commonly known
even by f the merchants doing business
with the islands. For the present Collect

Supreme Court's Action Commented
On. by Representative Men.
COLORADO. SPRINGS. Col., Mav 2S.â
Secretary 1 of the Navy Lone and^Eerialor
McMillan of Michigan, who", are in the
city , were interviewed upon the ' decision
of the Supreme Court upon the Insular
cases terminated yesterday. Following
are their opinions: ; ; \^ '. :â¢ : : , â¢
SECRETARY LONGâ It establishes
ing of the law.
Contention of the Government.
The Government contention Is that this
tax is not an export tax, for the reason
that Its collection is not incident to the
shipping of goods out of the United
States, but Is Incident to their shipment
into Porto Rico. It is contended by the
Department of Justice that the Supreme
Court in the case # of Woodruff against
I'arham defined exports to be articles
shipped from the United States to some
foreign port, and it Is pointed out that in
the De Lima case the court has just held
that' Porto Rico is not foreign, but that it
is domestic territory. It is contended that
the tax on imports into Porto Rico Is im
posed not under the power of Congress to
regulate commerce between several States
and with foreign countries but under the
power to prescribe all needful rules and
regulations respecting territory of the
United States, and that its purpose is to
raise revenues for Porto Rico.
Bearing ' on the Philippines.
The importance of this question would
not be great if nothing depended upon
It, except the validity of taxes collected
in Porto'RIco during the short time which
the Porto Rlcan tariff has to run before
It expires by limitation, but upon the de
cision of the court will depend the power
of Congress to enact legislation for. tho
collection of customs taxes in the Philip
pines on goods shipped from the United
States. Serious complications might fol
low a decision that such taxes would not
be valid, as the treaty, of peace provides
ant bearing on the question of what Is
an export tax. The Solicitor. General to
day obtained leave to file a petition for a
rehearing In the case K of Fairbanks
against the United States, which is the
case in which the court decided that an
internal revenue stamp on an export bill
of lading was a tax on exports and was
unconstitutional. ' .
It has been the general belief that a de
cision in the case of fourteen diamond
rings, Emil Pepke claimant, which in
volves the question of the validity of du
ties collected on Imports into the. United
States from the Philippines, would follow
the decision in the De Lima case and that
the court would hold that the duties were
wrongfully collected. . '
Solicitor General Is Hopeful.
Solicitor General Richards, however,
does not think that It necessarily follows
that the fourteen diamond rings case will
be decided against; the Government. Ho
said- to-night: "The Government ought
to and I have \ no doubt will go on .col
lecting duties on Imports from the Philip
pines as heretofore. I do not consider
that the decision in the Porto ;Rlcan case
in sny way controls : the .'decision of the
Philippines case, v; If; think , that - it ., Is
distinct. The status of the Philippines af
ter thetreaty of peace was distinct from
that of Porto Rico, both because of the res
olutions which were adopted with refer
ence particularly to the Philippines at the
time of the ratification of; the treaty, and
during the last session, and also because
of the fact that we did; not take posses-
the power of Congress to legislate
for the Territories and the new
j insular possessions. I do not care
to discuss it further.
SENATOR McMILLANâ I anticipat
ed the decision and like all other
good Republicans, am well pleased
with it. It is" good for the coun
try. The decision will enable Pres
ident Mckinley's plans to be car-
ried out now and in the future. \
CLEVELAND, May 28.â Senator M. A.
Hanna said to-day that the Suoreme
Court decisions in the insular cases would
greatly help In solving the government of
the islands.- He was. asked If he thought
the decision was entirely satisfactory
from the'standpoint of the administration.
SENATOR HAMA-I cannot j speak
for the administrationâ only , for
myself. Speaking for myself, 1
think . I . am satisfied with the de
cision, at least so far. as I hava
read it.

Upon the Decisions.

which comments upon' the decisions of the
United * States - Supreme Court â¢ in the Â¦ in
sular cases as "perhaps the most momen
tous which this tribunal was ever called
upon Â¦ to" make," .regards them Â¦ as. a "cu
rious 'issue^to 120 years of triumphant de
mocracy ,"'and says:
"It is' not^ progress, but retrogression;
not the'; advancement, of humanity, but
to the Philippine Islands of the principles
laid down in the Porto Rico cases was the
theme most discussed by business men
yesterday. The leading question naturally
w"as concerning the effect that the deci
sions would have upon the business of the
Pacific Coast. The dutiable imports from
Manila to this port are small, while tha
exports to the Philippines are. large,
amounting to from $50,000 to $70,000 per
month, exclusive of the supplies for the
army abroad. Mr. Brooks thinks that
natural conditions, coupled with a short
age of tonnage on the Pacific Coast. are.
sufficient to | prevent the Importation of
any great volume of Philippine products
for the present, even If the existing Phil
ippine tariff should be set aside by r?Â»3on
of the Porto. Rico cases.
Manila rope, which last year,represent
ed a value in the list of imports to this
port of. $465,771; came duty free. Tobacco,
sugar, coffee and copra are the other
leading articles of export from the Phlllp
pinesJ They did not figure very heavily
last year Â¦ at this port. Auditor i Cope o*
the Custom-house has furnished The Call
with figures relating to the value of dutia
ble good3 Imported to this port during the
year 1900. By months the "totals were &3
follows: $497, February $1730,
March $1192, April $1312. May $336, Jur.a
$790, July $602. August $813. September 5205,'
October $194, December $292. .
Will Collect Duties.
The tariff - has kept out the dutiable
products of the. Philippines almost entire
ly,' as appears from these figures, but
there are possibilities to which opening
the tariff door would give rise, and this Is
the phase of the matter that has aroused
public interest. Interviews indicate that
DUTIES ARE STILL COLLECTED.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N. W.. WASHINGTON, May 2S.
"Wc will go right along collecting duties on' imports from the Phil
ippines," said Secretary Gage to-day. "The Supreme Court has not
decided that we cannot collect duties on Imports from the Philip-
pine?, and until such -decision Is rendered we will continue to collect
duties just as we have been doing. Importers can file their protests with
each payment of duty, and if the court finally decides that we had no right
to collect taxes the money will have to be refunded." .
Assistant Secretary Spauldlng, who has direct charge of all matters re
lating to customs, 'said to-day that he could not as yet say how much the
United States would have to refund under the decisions of the Supreme
Court. He sfcid about $2,000,000 had been collected ln duties on Imports from
the Philippines after the ratification of the treaty of peace and before the
enactment of ,the.Foraker law, but only those payments which had been made
under protest would have to be refunded, and there were no figures of the
department showing how many were paid under protest. He said he had
asked the Bureau of Statistics to furnish him with, a statement of the
amounts that had been collected on Imports from the and from
Hawaii, but had not yet received the figures. '
TsiV J3T ERCHANTS who deal In tobacco see danger in setting 1 aside the
"tvL/% tariff duties- which now shut out the product of the cigar factories
I Igf H of Manila from the States. Cheap labor is ' operating in the Phillp-
X T A. pine Islands. If the Treasury Department adheres to its present
determination to proceed as heretofore under the existing tariff for
a season, time may be gained for Congress to meet and take ac
tion-looking toward the protection of those who have their capital invested ln
this country. A case directly affecting the Philippines cannot be brought
before' the Supreme Court of the United States within a period of several
months.

Former Captain Cyril King Testifies
About the Alleged Bribe
Given to Him.
MOBILE, Ala., May 28.â Former Captain
and Quartermaster Cyril W. King was on
the stand in the United States District
Court to-day in his own defense against
the charge of accepting a bribe from Con
tractor Hobsoii. His testimony was in ef
fect that Hobson was greatly behind in
his contract work at Fort Morgan, and
unless helped would fall. King and Hob
son agreed that the margin of loss was
between $6000 and $8000, and that if King
would give Hobson his personal services
in helping him complete the contract
Hobson would give him $3000, or one-half
the minimum amount at stake. King
said he performed numerous services for
Hobson and boiieved he fairly earned the
monpy paid him by Hobson.
Tramps Kill a Policeman's Son..
. CARROLLTON, Mo., May 28.â Charles
McKinney, a son of Policeman McKinney,
was shot and killed at 2 o'clock this morn
ing while assisting his father to arrest a
gang of tramps. Three of the gang were
arrested and placed In jail. A half-dozen
others escaped and were pursued by the
Sheriff and a posse to a point three miles
south of Carrollton, where they were sur
rounded. Here a lively fight ensued, the
tramps exchanging shots with the posse.
Two of the tramps were rounded up, but
not before the Sheriff's horse was shot
from under him. The others escaped to
the woods.
Court Upheld in murderer's Case.
WASHINGTON. May 28.â The United
States Supreme Court to-day affirmed the
judgment of the Supreme Court for the
State of Washington ln the case , of
Charles Nordstrom, under sentence of
death on the charge of murder committed
In that State, and directed that the man
date be Issued at once. The case has be
come well known by reason of the fact
that Nordstrom's death sentence has been
postponed for nine years by reason of le
gal complications.

CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, May 2S.-De
cisions were not announced to-day
in the remaining insular cases, the
fourteen diamond rings case, in
volving the validity of duties collected in
the Philippines subsequent to the ratifi
cation of the treaty of peace, and the sec
ond Dooley case, Involving the validity of
duties . collected in Porto Rica undsr . th?
Porto -Rican act. . .
There Is little difference of opinion
among officials of the administration as
to what the decision will-.be in the Dooley
case. It Is believed that the court will
follow its reasoning in y the Downes case
and will hold that the tax on Imports into
Porte Rico la one which it was within the
power Â©f Congress to Impose for the pur
pose of raising revenue for the island.
Eminent lawyers outside of administra
tion circles, however, are not confident
that this will be the decision. The point
was raised by counsel in this case that
this tax was really a tax on exports from
the United States and that it comes with
in that provision of the constitution which
prohibits the -laying of a tax on exporta
tions from any State. It was argued that
it made no difference that the tax was
actually collected in Porto Rico on the ar
rival of goods there and was not collected
at the time of their departure from a port
in the United States, but that it was nev
ertheless a. tax imposed .by Congress on
goods shipped out of the United States
and was an export tax within the meah-
LONDON, May 2$.â "The Boxers are
again active in all districts where there
are no foreign troops." says a dispatch to
the Standard from Tientsin, dated May 27.
"Yesterday a missionary who was going
to Tulu on the grand canal was forced to
return to Tientsin on account of a fierce
fight raging between Boxers and Catholic
converts. There was heavy firing on both
sides."
"Four thousand Insurgents from the
province of Kwaichau have Invaded the
province of Szechaun," says the Shanghai
correspondent of the. Standard, wiring
yesterday, "causing a widespread panic.
It is said that 3000 Tunnanese are about
to join them."
Agrees to British Proposal.
Dr. Morrison, wiring to the Times from
Peking, says: "M. de Giers has announced
that Russia agrees to the formation of a
Â¦mixed commission, such as is proviaed for
in the British proposal. It Is expected
that Russia will also agree to Great Brit
ain's indemnity proposals. Count von
Waldersee has written to the Ministers of
the powers proposing that the provisional
croverninent of Tientsin shall continue un
til the last troops have been withdrawn,
tut the Ministers are generally ln favor of
permitting China to resume the govern
â¢xnent forthwith."
French Storm Walled Town.
A Paris special says: A dispatch re
Â«celvefi here from General Voyron at Tien
tsin, dated May Â£6, says that a reconnol
terlng party came upon a walled town fif
Â¦teen kilometers northeast of Tingchau.
The town authorities refused to open the
gates, whereupon the French artillery
.opened fire. The wall was breached and
the town taken- One French infantryman
â¢was wounded. General Bailloud is scour
"ing the country with a column of French .
:troops and is supporting the Chinese regu- ,
lars.
A Berlin special says: The German
press, without exception, comments in.
Terms of approval upon the news that
; Emperor William has ordered Count von
Waldersee and the German troops to re
turn home.
The reports that negotiations are in
progress between the Cabinets of the pow
ers with reference to' a joint appointment
of a commander of the troops of the allies
remaining in China are semi-ofiicially con
f.rmed. The Lokal Anzeiger says that it
hears that Count von Waldersee's suc
cessor will probably be a Frenchman.
America May Bs Left Out.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. X.
XV., WASHINGTON. May 28.â If the
United States declines to join in an inter
national guarantee of the Chinese loan to
be raised to pay the indemnity it may be
thai Continental Europe will determine to
pledpe its credit without reference to the
attitude of this Government. The effect
of such action would be to place the
United States outside of the concert, only,
however, with respect to this one point.
The authorities have no fear that this -will
be the outcome of the discussion, though
they understand that a movement of this
kind will be attempted if the President
persists in the attitude that the Chinese
Government issue bonds bearing 3 per
< cent interest, to be disposed of as each
; nation receiving them sees fit. In view
of the comparatively small amount of the
( American indemnityâ $25,000,000â the offi
cials say Jt would be manifestly absurd
for the United States to pledge Its credit
to pay, ln case of default, the sum of
. $212,000,000, all of which Is to go into the
coffers of other nations.
Regard for Von Waldersee.
In his reply to the German announce
ment of withdrawal of Field Marshal von
Waldersee, Acting Secretary of State Hill
expressed the satisfaction of this Govern
ment with Germany's decision. Having
withdrawn its troops from China, with
the exception of a email legation guard,
this Government thereby expressed its
View with rpgard to further military occu
pation of China. Acting Secretary Hill
took occasion to express the high personal
respect and esteem with which Field Mar
shal von Waldersee was regarded by the
officers of the United States in China and
their appreciation of the personal cour
tesies which he had extended to them. â¢

ly to The Hague arbitration court, prom
ising to abide by the decision of the tri

General Schoeman was a great Kruger

handed down by the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals for this circuit on
February 20, 1898. The decision was writ
ten by Judge Morrow and was in the case
of the United States against Endleman,
who was charged with selling liquor to
Indians. Endleman set up the Issue that
the constitution was confined to the
United States proper and that the criminal
laws did not extend Into the Territories.
Judge Morrow in his opinion held that
Congress had full, legislative power over
the Territories unrestricted by the limita
tions of the constitution. 2X> '-
The opinion goes on to" say:
In support of the first ground of demurrer
It Is contended that the law upon which the
prosecution is based la unconstitutional be
cause among other things the Government of
the United States can exercise only \ those
specific powers conferred upon It by the consti
tution. â¢ â¢ â¢ The answer to this and other
like objections urxed in the brief ot counsel for
defendant is found In the now -well established
doctrine that the Territories of the United
States are entirely subject to the legislative
authority of Congress. They are not organized
under the constitution, nor subject to its
complex distribution of the powers of govern-'
ment as the organic, but are the creation ex
clusively of the legislative department and sub
ject to its supervision and control. The United
States, having rightfully acquired the Terri
tories and being the only Government which
can Impose laws upon them, has the entire
dominance of sovereignty, national, municipal.

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, May 28.âDur
ing their, journey across Iowa President
McKinley and the members, of his Cab
inet spent much of their time reading and
discussing the published reports of 'the
opinions of the Supreme Court in the In
sular cases. They were much interested
in the way the court divided In the two
caÂ«es The decision in the De Lima case,
if followed in the Philippines, as It Is as
sumed it will be, might result in the call
ing of an extra session of Congress. In
the De Lima case the court decided that
the duties collected on Porto Rican goods
before Congress enacted the Foraker law
were illegal and must be refunded. It is
presumed that the court, following the
same lines of reasoning, will decide that the
duties collected on goods from the Philip
pines were also illegal and that goods
from the Philippines are subject to free
entry into the United states until Con
gress acts, as it has already done in the
case of Porto Rico. - Such a decision would
mean not only the refunding of duties
heretofore collected, but would open the
ports of the United States to merchandise
and goods of every description from the
Philippines until Congress meets In De
cember. . -It is palpable that importers
might take 'advantage " of this to ship
goods into the United. States through the
Philippines and thus defraud the Gov
ernment of its Â¦ revenues. ; "Whether-- the
danger from this source Is great enough
to warrant the calling of Congress In ex
tra session is one which will be decided
only after full deliberation. It is possi
ble* however.- that this danger may have
been already obviated in the enactment
of the Spooner resolution delegating tem
porarily to the President the power to
govern the Philippines. This may be con
sidered an act of . Congress within the
meaning of. the Downes case, affirming
the constitutionality of the. Foraker law.
But it is a delicate question and one
which the President and his advisers will
consider in all its bearingB before coming
to a conclusion. The members of the

and former secretary and trustee of the
Carnegie Company, in which Blackburn
names the Carnegie Company as code
fendant, and seeks to secure the transfer
and control* of Carnegie Company stock
of the value of $2,376,000, acquired by
Moreland when he held the Carnegie Com
pany trusteeship, and which stock he now
holds and has j refused to transfer unless
he is paid a half million dollars claimed
as compensation for - services as trustee.
The stock which Blackburn alleges is
unlawfully held . by Moreland is part of
the $3,200,000 of the- capital stock of the
Carnegie Company at the time of Its in
corporation for the benefit of deserving
employes and officials of .the company.
The bill of â¢ Blackburn shows that tho
stockholders of the Carnegie. Company en
tered into an agreement to set aside 2 per
cent of each individual's holdings to en
able the employes and officers who were
not stockholders to acquire an interest In
the company, following out- the plan of
stock distribution which Andrew Carnegie
had made a feature of the business in
past years, in. which manner many of the
incorporators of the- Carnegie Company
secured their interests. 1 .
Moreland's right to commission for his
services as trustee is | denied because he
was an officer of the company and when
the stock was placed- In his custody he
was simply acting in.the line of his duty
as secretary, as his predecessor in the
Carnegie Steel Company had done. It is
averred that since his retirement as sec

with the stock has been in preventing its
transfer to his successor and in obtain

"the tobacco Industry of the United States.
There are great cigar factories at Ma

. EXPRESS VIEWS
Customs Collector Ktratton said *hat he
had not been notified officially of the de
cision, and until then he should continue
to collect duties on goods coming froÂ«n the
Philippines. No vessels from the islands
are due at present, so that the non-notifi
catlcn will not do any damage either way.
In answer to the auestion as to the
probable action of the Collector in -cturn
lng to the consignees duties paid hereto
fore on goods arriving from the Philip
pines, Chief Clerk Jerome said that no
duties jwouid be returned to thÂ« payors
Â¦unless in cases in which a legal protest
had been filed within ten days after pay
ment of the duties. Not many such pro
tests had been filed, however. A few were
in the offlce from soldiers and officers
who h2d declared their intention to av.-a't
the decision cf the United States Supreme
Court before taking their goods out of
the Custom-house.
The officials cf the Treasury Depart
ment atj Washington, accordins *o a dis
patch received yesterday, are of opinion
that there is nothins in the Porto Rico
decisions to be considered conclusive in
relation to the Philippines. The refunding
of duties collected, as will be inferred
from the foregoing showing concerning
ihe amount of dutiable exports from the
Philippines last year, is a comparatively
Fmall matter.
certain merchants believe tree, tobacco
from the Philippines would greatly Injure

At least one leading merchant holds to

full text of the decision before him and
that it would require careful considera
tion before the entire Import of the opin
ions could be ascertained, with a view of
governing future executive action.
; Several Senators and Representatives
called on the. Secretary to-day and dis
cussed the situation with him, giving
their views and Interpretations of the
opinions rendered yesterday and the bear
ing they would have in the future gov
ernment of the Philippines.- Among these
w^is Senator Lodge of Massachusetts,
chairman of the Philippine Committee of
the Senate. He expressed the opinion
that the decisions of the. court would
make Philippine legislation absolutely nec
essary in the coming session of Congress.
He also^was clearly of the opinion that
under the Spooher law the President 'had
absolute power to provide for a revenue,
both customs and internal, for the Philip
pine Islands in the general scheme for the
Philippine government.- Another sugges
tion made by/ Senators, previous to the
time when it was supposed that a de
cision in the Philippine, case .would be
rendered by the court- similar to the De
Lima case in Porto Rico, was an export
duty on goods coming from the Philip
pines to the United States could'be levied
In order to prevent free trade from the
islands to the United -States. Any such
necessity will be obviated, however, by
the determination of the Treasury De
partment to continue to collect -Dingley
rates on Philippine .'products and: goods
coming from the Islands. â¢ -
Figures were furnished at the War De
partment showing the collections from the
Philippines. From April '11, 1899,; to Feb
ruary 28, 1901; there, were . collected on
goods imported from the United- States
into the Philippines $1,012,925. During the
aame period there ' were collected ; on ex
ports from the Philippines to the United
States ?1S6,149. - : A. â¢--
From April 11, 1899, until April 12,: 1900,
the date of the passage: of the Foraker
law, the 'collections on imports from the
United States to Porto Rico were $43t>.237.
It Is believed that the- War Department
will promulgate a tariff for the* Philip
pines soon. The Philippine Commission,
together : with officers ; in charge of the
customs of the islands,* prepared a provi
sional draft for a new Philippine tariff,
which was. pu blished, In .March. . That
draft has been undergoing a number of
modifications â¢ at the ;\Var : Department,
and is still receiving . consideration. Sec
retary Root- has been holding back this
tariff, awaiting the decision of : the Su
preme Court in the Insular cases, -and.it
is . now. probable that: it will>not be pro
mulgated Â¦Â¦ until he has had time to:exam
ine the opinions of the court with care.,
The following statement is : made : con
cerning. the proposed tariff and '.what ; is
being done'at the War Department: <-; ."â¢/Â¦â¢â¢
'The: tariff, as prepared at Manila, was based
the subject they manifested much regret
at the outcome, as they had hoped to have
refunded all the moneys paid under the
15 per cent application of the Dingley du
ties.' It was generally expected that the
court's decisions would grant Porto Rico
free trade and her citizens full citizenship
and constitutional privileges. "When told
that if the latter privilege had been grant
ed the internal revenue laws of the united
States would be applied to the islands and
that all funds and- customs thereunder
collected --would be deposited- in the Fed
eral treasury, all Porto Ricans questioned
in the matter acknowledged that this
would be bad. and that their^present
status was preferable, as they, did not be
lieve that the Island would stand the col
lection of the United States internal rev
enue, and that such collections, if at
terr.pted, would necessitate an even heav
ier property tax for the maintenance of
Porto Rico.
Only a few Porto Rican business. men
understand the importance of the Supreme
Court's decisions: Those who are bank
ers predict an immediate revival" of busi
ness now that the status of the country
has been decided. The manager of anfim
portant bank, who requests that his name
not -be used, says that he is in favor of
the tariff unless it absolutely proved that
Porto Rico internal revenues are sufficient
for^ the island's needs. The.J. T. Silva
Banking Company said: . . '
The whole thing Is a fiasco. "We like to be
citizens of the United States," but without the
application of United States Internal revenue
collections. The latter would kill our indus
tries: , ." . -^ . '
The Fritze-Lundt Company,' which Is the
largest shipper of sugar ' in . Porto Rico,
said: . , '..,--
The constitution of the United States applies
Â¦when ' against us,' but not when in -our favor.
This has always been so since the beginning.
If the tariff had been removed at first; Porto
Rico would npw have double crops. The Amer
ican system of. taxation cannot be applied here;
there should be pome sensible tax on flour and
rice, but-, sugar should .be â¢ free. Â¦ This legisla

By agreement with New York houses
many Porto Rican shippers will receive

as, much disappointed 'at not being, grant

The members of the Cabinet seem to fa
vor free trade. The island's yearly budget
is $2,000,000. A rough semi-official ;esti
mate gives an income, of $500,000 'a" year
from the property tax, $750,000 from excise
collections under the Hollander bill and
$750,000 from customs collections. The
property tax will be in force July 1, and
assessments will be made on an estimated
valuation of $100,000,000. Excise duties are
now being collected. Porto . Ricans are
generally of the opinion that their Legis
lature should now act. It is understood
that Governor Allen Is giving: his earnest
consideration to the practicability of se
curing at an early date free trade rela
tions between 1 - Porto Rico and Germany.
: As a result of the consultations In
Washington between Governor Allen and
President McKinley. Mr. Hollander will
in a few days submit a report to Gover
nor Allen* showing the operations of the
former's new revenue act, from which it
will appear that expectations are enter
tained as to the adequacy of the measure
It has been fully realized that the insular
.treasury is rapidly approaching a condi
tion where it can dispense with the cus
toms receipts' accruing from trade with
the United States without in any wise en
dangering the present secure financial po
sition of the Island. . By the provision of
section 3 of. the Foraker bill free trade
becomes operative whenever the Porto
Rican Legislature passes A a resolution
that an adequate system of insular taxa
tion has been put into operation and
President McKinley. upon notification of
this resolution, -is. to proclaim free trade
for Porto Rico. If the plan now in con
templation is carried out Governor Allen
will convene the in extra ses
sion solely for the purpose of passing this
resolution. TMs action will probably bo

lander bill will have been in force for
nearly one month, and it Ja probable that
froc trade will be declared in October.
WHILE the presidents of the several commercial . organizations of
the city who have been Interviewed have not come to any definite
conclusion concerning the local effect of the decisions of the Su
preme Court of the United States referring to the insular tariff,
President George A. Newhall of the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce undoubtedly reflects the views of the membership of these bodies
when he says that if It shall be found that the Pacific Coas^ is likely to be
seriously damaged by the withdrawal of the duties upon importations from
the Philippine Islands it is probable the trade organizations of the coast .will
meet to take some. action looking toward legislation by Congress.
COMMERCIAL BODIES MAY ACT.
entirely upon the specific system of duties,
which levies customs charges according to
weight or number of the imported articles
rahther than according to value. This prin
ciple has the approval of Secretary Root, but
it is thought desirable to apply an ad valorem
limit to certain cases where there is a wido
difference between the values of articles classi
fied under the same paragraph. The specific
duties will be retained In most of these cases,
but It will be provided that the articles shall
pay not, less than a certain ad valorem rate.
The ad valorem rate on the necessaries of life
and articles essential to the development of the
islands will not run hisrher than 15 per cent,"
taut upon articles less necessary it will rise to
20 per cent and in the case of luxuries to higher
proportions. In such cases the specific duty
will first be assessed, the value of the article
will then be estimated and It will be deter
mined whether the amount- of the specific duty
is as much as the ad valorem limit. If the
amount of the specific duty falls below the an
valorem limit a sufficient amount will be added
to bring the net duties up to the limit. If the
specific duty is higher than the ad valorem
limit it will be collected in full without refer
ence to such a limit. It Is believed that this
method of assessing the duties will obviate the
objections made by the Philippine Commission
to any ad valorem duties, upon the ground that
they would afford temptation to undervaluation
and be difficult to fix in the absence of com
petent experts in the Custom-house at Manila.
The effect of any practicable degree of un
dervaluation under the system proposed would
be trifling upon the net duties paid and not
worth the risk or seeking to defraud the rev
enue. - Absolute accuracy In valuation will be
less important moreover than under the
American tariff, and the proposed system In thÂ»
nature of the case will tend to equalize dif
ferences arising under I the system of purely
specific duties, even If the equalization is not
perfect.
Â¦ The limit of 15 per cent will apply to a preat
variety of articles under the metal schedule,
which it was found impossible to distribute
under specific duties. Tools and implements,
cutlery,, needles, pens., miscellaneous manu
facturers of iron and steel and ot zinc, copper
and nickel will be required to ray duties of
not less than 15 per cent. In all these cases
the specific duty will be i collected, whether
it amounts to 15 per cent or more, but where
it falls below 15 per cent ad valorem, an es
timate, of the value of the articles will bo
made and the amount of duty raised. to 15 per
cent ad â¢valorem. Plate glass and mirrors will
be required to pay not less than 20 per cent,
while the limit In the case of cut " srlass,
watch glass and similar fine products will be
fixed at not less than 30 per cent. It Is prob
able that the rate on. precious stones will T>e
fixed at .15 per cent. . in order to obviate the
temptation to smuggling. The rate on nickel
will probably be hipher than in' the provisional
tariff prepared at Manila.

PHILADELPHIA. May 28.â The one
hundredth and thirteenth Presbyterian
General Assembly was dissolved at 6:15
o'clock "to-night by Moderator Minton, af
ter havinp been - In session nearly two
weeks, during which time many matters
of the utmost importance to the church
were considered. Chief among these was
the question regarding the revision of the
confession of faith. After a discussion
continuing nearly four days this mo
mentous question was referred to a "spe
cial committee, which will make recom
mendations as to' the manner In which the
creed should be revised and present them
to the next general assembly, which will
meet in New York: .
To-day, for the first time since the as
sembly convened, the harmony among
the commissioners was distributed by the
Introduction of personalities. The trouble
occurred during the discussion on the
chairmanship of the revision committee.
The Rev. Dr. J. D. Moffatt .suggested a
change in the minutes of yesterday's ses
sion, so that the records would show that
a new committee had been appointed to
revise the creed, regardless of the old
committee of which the Rev. Dr. Charles
A. Dickey was chairman. His suggestion
v/as adopted, and the Rev. James E. Mof
fatt of Cumberland. Md., moved that
Moderator Minton be elected chairman of
the committee.
This incensed the friends of Dr. Dickey,
end although Dr. Meffatt's motion pre
vailed, the subject was revived later in
the session by the Rev. S. J. Niccolls of
St. Louis. Dr. Niccolls moved to recon
sider the motion but as he had not been
present during the earlier debate he was
declared out of order. The motion to re
consider was then renewed by the Rev.
\V. D. Crockett of Canton. Pa., and many
of the commissioners participated in the
debate that followed.
Realizing the delicacy of his position.
Moderator Minton relinquished the chair
to Vice Moderator Pitcairn. The matter
Â¦was finally adjusted by Dr. Dickey, who
advised the assembly against reconsider
ing: the motion, saying he was confident
there had been no attempt to cast any re
flection upon him but that the commis
cioners merely desired to honor his suc
cessor as moderator.
Dr. Dickey's friends wanted the election
of the chairman to be made by the com
mittee, in which event it is conceded Dr.,
Dickey would have been re-elected. The
motion, however, was lost. There are
Btlll six members of the revision cimmit
tee to be appointed, but Moderator Min
ton said to-day that he had not yet made
any selection. The closing hours of the
assembly were_ devoted to routine mat
ters.

SEATTLE, May 28.â A special dispatch
from Dawson under date of May 23 says
that tho steamer Bailey arrived K there
that morning. Following the arrival of
the Bailey, the steamers Clossett and El
Dorado were dispatched up the river for
La Barge, carrying mail and passengers.
The steamer' Zealandian was at Selwyn
on the morning of May 23, and was ex
pected to get through to Dawson that
evening. Lake La Barge was breaking up
and was unsafe for travel on May 23. No
accidents had taken place, although peo

The Nome Gold Digger of April 3 states
that the body of Henry Stewart has been
found near the headwaters of Pish River,
not far from the place where the remains
of his partner, Welch, were discovered.
Stewart was well known here and in Ta
coma. Both men were frozen to death in
the blizzard that swept over the ISiome
country the past winter.
Dogs Freeze in Harness.
L. M. Hamilton and John McClelland,
who left Nome early- in on the
trail of the Barreau party, arrived bock
on March 30 after a terrible trip of 105
days. They were unable to say how so
vere the cold was, but it was so intense
that dogs froze to death in harness, and
If a man stood for a few minutes on the
trail he had to exert himself to keep from
freezing. When they reached Point Blos
som the thermometer had been frozen for
two weeks at 50 below.
Mr. Hamilton discounts the stones of
gold that come from the Good Hope coun
try. His party was not successful in find
ing- any, and as far as he could learn the
only gold discovered there has been on the
Reed River.
"Point Blossom is the most desolate
place in the world," said Hamilton. "The
natives are in a destitute condition. At
Point Hope we found sixteen white men
married to native women."
New Reindeer Station.
W. A. Barreau, Archie Mitchell, Robert
Crowdy and Al Rhodes reached 'Â¦amp the
first of the week, after probably *he hard
est trip that four men have ever Â«xperl
enced in Alaska. They left Nome four
months ago and traveled almost continu
ously, Â¦with the thermometer for days
registering 60 below zero. In faot, it was
so cold that a number of their does froze
to death while on the trail. They reached
Point Hope, expecting there to procure
provisions to replenish their supplies, but
found the trading- station destitute of
everything but flour, so they had to turn
back, and will attempt to get into the
country agrain by water in the spring-.
The Barreau party .nearly lost their
lives near Elephant Point. They were
caught in a blizzard and lay for furtv
eight hours in their sleeping bags without
food or fire, and if the storm had con
tinued twelve hours longer all would cer
tainly have perished. The party started
from Nome alone, but they were followed
by stampeders who were waiting lor them
all along: the line to follow on their trail.
After mushing nearly 1000 miles -Dr.
Francis H. Gambell. of the Eaton rein

Special Dispatch to The CalL
LOS ANGELES, May 2S.â Father and
â¢laughter were pitted against one another
to-<3ay In a case on trial In Department
3 before Judge Ballard of Santa Ana.
Colonel Blantcn Duncan, the Kentuckian,
trhoso testimony constantly reverted to
the days before the war, is Beeking to re
cover from his daughter, Mrs. Katherine
D. Lewis, the jewels and other personal
property left by his dead wife, the mother
of Mrs. Lewte. The trial was at times
funny, at times pathetic â bo pathetic that
few smiled even at things which in an or
dinary trial rn5ght have provoked mirth.
With her husband and her attorneys
Mre. Lewis, handsome, exquisitely dressed
Jn black and wearing a heavy crapo veil,
kju at one end of the table. Occasionally,
us her dead mother's name was men
tioned, she quietly vrlped the tears from
her eyes.
On the witness stand was her father,
plainly dressed, and at his side on the
flocr was an oid hat that had certainly
seen better day^. Assisted by H. B. Alex
ander, the Kentuekian is representing
himself. He appeared in court carrying a
email tin trunk, plush lined, which he
fcaid was made for the family plate which
he is trying, among other things, to res
cue from Mrs. Lewis. The trunk is now
tilled with law books and papers pertain
ing to the caee.
The property in question Is worth nearly
JT.000 and includes pictures, a few articles
of furniture, diamonds and other jewels,
purchased in the United States and
abroad, and a lace dress, valuable only as
an heirloom. It is not on account of the
value of the property that the fight is
being: made, for each is Â¦wealthy, but be
cause the articles aro valuable as heir
looms and because neither wants to elve
up to the other. Mrs. Lewis claims her
mother gave the property to her.
When asked to describe specifically the
jewelry Colonel Duncan acknowledged
that his recollection regarding; it was
"glimmering." as it was purchased nearly
a half-century ago.
Mrs. Lewis was called to the stand iate
Jn the afternoon and testified that her
mother had given her much of the jewel
rj* when she was a girl of 17 and the
remainder a little more than a year ago.
The silverware, she told the court, was
purchased by her mother soon after her
marriage with Colonel Duncan, with
money eiven to her by her father as a
weddingr present. This Mrs. Ehincan also
gave her daughter.
The case will continue to-morrow.

SAN JOSE, May 28.â Henry E. Miller,
tho student who was refused a diploma
at the State Normal School, and subse
quently reinstated by order of Judge Hy
land of the Superior Court, was apain
dismissed from the school this morning.
For five weeks, Miller has been taking
instruction in teaching, the only subject
on which he had failed, and'hia name had
been posted as a candidate for gradua
tion with the June class. After Judge
HyJand had decided 'that Miller. was un
justly dismissed, the Attorney General,
who represented the faculty, was slow in
filing an appeal to the . Supreme Court,
and Miller succeeded in 'getting- back in
to the school. * .
Yesterday President Dtdley received
word that the appeal had been taken and
he could dismiss Miller. The faculty at
once met, and this morning when Miller
put* in his appearance, he was told he
could no longer attend school. Besides
this, the president of the school says that
reports of Miller's work - In ' preparatory
teaching were adverse, and that he would
have been unable to graduate.
Miller declares these reports on the part
of his teacher, Miss English, were preju
diced, and that, while he did better work"
than others, he received less credit. Mil
ler's attorneys will fight the case in the
upper courts and yet hope to win.
Student Miller has attended the various
normal schools in this State for upward
of six years, and has had trouble at most
of them. He is about forty years of age,
and.- before entering the normal, taught
for a number of years. . Â¦ .

. STANFORD UNIVERSITY. May 28.â
To-aay was exclusively the alumni's,. and
Stanford's sturdy body of graduates, none
of whom have yel reached the ,age of
gray hair, rallied around the standard of
their alma mater. I And judging by the
way they feasted and toasted the alumni
have not forgotten Â¦' their college days and
experiences. Â¦ for three hours they sat
around the tables of the Rob'e dining hall,
which had been burdened with delicacies
suited Â¦ to please the palate, while those
.who knew the early life of Stanford best
told the members of "the graduating 'class
what 'good times were had by those for
tunate enough to have been here during
the "days of grapes," when the pioneers â
the members of the class of 'S3â ruled the
university.
J^eslie M. Eurwcll '9H, president; of the
Alumni Association, acted as toastmas
terand led the onslaught of wit that was
directed at the "pioneers" by the mem
bers of all 'the other classes, who seemed
envious of. the distinction enjoyed by those
flrst to finish four years of Stanford un
dergraduate life.
President Jordan was the last speaker
on .the programme. He reviewed the early
struggles* through which the university
went, telling of the. time when it was in
pawn for eight million dollars in gold and
did not know how it was going to raise
the money to get out; of the dark days
when the dread fear of an adverse ruling
in the famous Stanford suit had left the
university penniless and almost hopeless.
Wlien Hone "Had Fled.
One incident to which he referred made
those who have entered the college since
the "hard times" realize just how gloomy
the outlook then seemed to all. it was
the time the university borrowed ?200 with
which to give a reception to the class of
.'95, believing that it would be the last
chance they would have to give such a
reception, : as its doors would be closed
by the Sheriff ere another year came.
Dr. Jordan said that Stanford had noth
ing more to ask for from the State legis
lators, and spoke gratefully of the hand
some vote which the people of California
had given the Stanford amendment las>t
fall. The university was now in a posi
tion to complete the plans of Its founders.
â¢As soon as -the buildings now being con
structed were completed every depart
ment would be welL housed and Stanford
wpuld have ample provision for 1000 stu
dents. , - , /
"This is to be the largest number we ever
want. here," he said, ."as Stanford 1 !â¢, to
be great not in numbers, but in Its inlla
ence on those who come in contact v.-ith
it. Her' graduates will be able to say of
her as. did DanieL Webster of Dartmouth:
'Stanford Is a small collet*, but there are
thoseof us who love her.' The policy^of
the institution will be to have no concern
about the numbers, but rather abput the
effectiveness which Is instilled into her
graduates."

UNITED VEEDE MINE
c IS HEAVH/X" ASSESSED
Senator Clark Must Pay $240,000 in
Taxes In One Arizona
County.
PHQENIX, Ariz., May 28.â For the first
time since he acauiredhis immense mine
holdings in Arizona Senator W. A. Clark
of Montana is to be compelled to pay
heavy taxes. It has jusl been decided in
Yavapai County to assess the United
Verdo mine', Clark's Â¦ great property, at
$6,000,000, making- an annual tax of $240,000
on the mine. Heretofore the United Verde
has been assessed at $60,000 and paid $24,000
In taxes.
The action in putting the increased as
sessment on Clark is a result of the last
Territorial Legislature. Until tho late ses
sion of that body Senator Clark held
strong 1 control over the lawmaking organ
ization. At each session a heavy bullion
tax, {aimed at Clark's mine, has befcn de
feated, and in a half-hundred tilts the
agents of the owner of the Verde Lave
always won. At the recent session a bill
was introduced intended to divide Tavapai
County and. put the United Verde mine,
with its town of Jerome, in a county by
itself. All of Senator Clark's strength
was given tlie measure, but it was beaten.
Now the power in control in the county is
retaliating upon the Senator from Mon
tana.
The value of the Verde, dbubtless the
richest mine in the world, has oeen esti
mated on a scale ranging from $50,000,000
to $150,000,000, and in the recent formation
of the Amalgamated Copper Company the
Clark mine was listed at $75,000,000.
EL PASO, Texas, May 28.â Swift pun

waymen became so bold that they would
stop Mexican Central freight trains,
open. box cars and load Into their wagorjg
whatever freight they wanted and drive
away to the mountains.
The late "Diamond Dick," an Â»jc-Texas
ranger, was employed by the Mexican
Central road to capture the robbers. "Dia
mond Dick" killed several of them, but
was not able, single handed, to copo with
the situation. Recently. the'rallroad offi
cials appealed to President Diaz for relief
and ho ordered soldiers to proceed to ex
terminate the robbers. The soldiers were
empowered to act aa sheriff. Judare, Jury
and executioner. 1
Last Saturday near Yermo four out of
a band of eight robbers were captured In
"the act of robbing a. freight train. Tho
soldiers, who had been concealed in a
freight car to trap the bandits, lined up
the prisoners and riddled them, with bul

Oakland Track to Close.
Charles F. Price, general manager of
thÂ«Â» new California Jockey Club, said yes
terday there was no truth in thÂ© report
that the racing would be continued indefi
nitely. Oakland track will close July 4
and possibly earlier.
Basslnger next closed the session by
landing Jih McCleevy winner of tho mile
and seventy-yard selling affair, the favor
ite, Merops, comiqg from the rear "and
Â«ecuring the show. Alicia stood a long,
hard drive, but McCleevy held his com
pany safe from the start.
Caesar Young's mare. Princess Titania,
closed a slight favorite over Vanthie in
the betting on the fifth event, a six fur-
Ions sprint, but failed to connect. The
latter headed Companion when about a
quarter of the route had been covered,
winning easily. The Princess ran second,
three lengths before Mamie Hildreth.
The colored boy Bassinger put in hla
time to good advantage a.t Oakland track
yesterday. Six times he faced the barrier
and on four occasions horses ridden by
him flashed by the Judges in front. Never
usleep at the post, he ra hard to catch if
once away in the lead.
The usual crowd from this s!de crossed
the bay. and met with only moderate
success In picking the winners. While
. Botany happened to be the only ttrst
choice to get brackets, none of tho differ
ent winners were quoted at extravagant
prices.
Always the possessor of speed and
mixed up with a very commonplace clus
ter of platers in the introductory sprint,
the talent allowed Blanche Sheppard to
t;et away from them. The mare soon
showed first after the start, and in a drive
beat Hohenlohe a length. Why Monda
had first call in the ring is certainly a
mystery. j_
None too amiable an actor, the flrat
maiden two-year-old dash looked almost
u certainty for Botany if he met with no
accident. From twos his odds fell to 7 to
6 and he won in a gallop from Maxelio.
Hig Massie, carrying tho turquoise blue

A large deal in Humboldt County realty
has Just been consummated by San Fran
cisco parties. Over 6000 acres of the finest
timber land In the State and a railroad ten
miles long havo passed out of the hands
of a Scotch. syndicate, known as tho Cali
fornia Redwood Company, "Into those of
J. R. Ilanlfy & Co. and Dolbeer & Car
son. For years the latter firms havo been
trying to secure this valuable tract of
land, but it was only within the past
month that tho deal took shape. The land
Ih covered with tho finest redwood forest
in California.
i Elk River runs through this valuable
property. Tho railroad on it is known as
the Buxport and Elk River Railroad Com
pany. It runs from tho Elk River mill to
Humboldt Bay, carrying lumber for ship
ment to San Francisco. The land la nearly
nil virgin forest, nnd it is not tho inten
tion of tho new owners to begin cutting
th'j trees until the necessity arises.
The district Is the happy hunting ground
of sportsmen, as deer aro plentiful and
duck nnd quail abound in season. On the
river there is one of the most beautiful
spots In tho State. It Is ono of tho few
lovel places on tho banks of tho Elk, and
there Mr. Hanlfy Intends building a hunt-
Ing lodgo In the near future.
"We have been trying for a lonpr time
to secure this land," said Mr. Ilanlfy yes
terday, "and now we are satisfied. Nearly
all tho redwood trees in tho State are
owned by a Scotch syndicate and It is in
no hurry to sell. Tho more land Is cleared
the more valuable does that ,whlch re
innliiH become. We have no Immediate
use for the lumber, ho we will let the trees
grow until wo want them. Dolbeer &
Carson and J. R. Ilanlfy A Co. now own
tho whole tract as well as the railroad,
but that fnct will not change- the present
state of affairs. It simply means that bo
many more acres of redwood land are
onco again owned In California."

to "secure a vote of a majority of its mem
bers before any action could be taken.

Little Joseph Silva, the adopted child of
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Clifford of 15G3 Fifth
street, West Oakland, has been lured
away from the care of loving friends by
his dissolute mother. She cheerfully gave
the boy away seven years ago, but has
lately become possessed of a desire to get
him back to live with her in a disreputa
ble district of this city..
For the last six weeks Mrs. Clifford, the
aged forter-mother, has wandered daily
hi a vain search for the little boy through
the dives and haunts of tho Barbary
Coust which Mrs. Sllva frequents. The
matter is now in the hands of Secretary
White of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, and every effort will
be made to restore the boy to his proper
guardians.
Jo&eph Silva, or- Clifford, as he is called,
Is nine years old. His father died more
than seven years ago, leaving his wife
with Joseph and another child, who died
during the last year. Shortly after the
father's death Mrs. Clifford observed the
Sllva woman maltreating her infant son
in the street in Oakland. She informed a
friend, and through the good offices of the
latter Joseph was given to Mrs. Clifford.
Necessary legal steps were taken and the
child was received into the Clifford home,
where every care and attention was lav
ished upon him.
The Dissolute Mother Appears.
The family became very much attached
to tho handsome, intelligent little fellow
and great pride was taken in his excep
tional accomplishments. On his part he
was liappy and contented and showed no
desiro to leave hiB pleasant home. He
was ne,ver informed by his foster parents
that he was not their own child until last
yeax, when his mother met him one day
and told him of their relationship. From
time to time she would leave her Pacific
street companions and so to Oakland to
seizo pome opportunity to converse with
the boy, Bne taught him to call her
"Molly," the num.'. by which Phe is known
In the half-world, and tried to Induce him
to go with her py means of promises of
luxurieH and pleasures which appeal to
itjÂ« childish hÂ«-iirt.

Seeking the Kidnaped Boy.
Yesterday, too exhausted to move
farther, Mrs. Clifford visited Secretary
Whlto and plteously begged him to nld
her In her anxious search. Sho was us
sured that everything possible would be
dono to recover her loved one, and lnst
night tho secretary and Officer McMurray
took up tho eeorch. Mrs. Clifford says
that she has been approached by a friend
of tho Sllva woman and told that the
child might be restored on condition of the
payment of money and tho onsurnnce that
tho abductors would not be prosecuted.
This proposal met with ready acqui
escence, but the intermediary became
alarmed and at a subsequent meeting said
that Mrs. Sllva had gone to Merced.
. Tho authorities throughout tho State
will bo notllled and no stone will .be left
unturned which may lead to the recovery
of tho child. Tho apprehension of tho
mother Is n secondary consideration.
The abducted boy is very fine looking.
His hair Is dark brown and his eyes of an
Intense- black. Ills particularly distin
guishing feature Is the presence of a
prominent dimple in each cheek.

[1 THE DISCOVERER OF
I; Lydia B. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
I The Great Worm^s Remedy for Woman's Ills.
No other medicine in the world has received such widespread
and unqilalificd endorsement <*>>â¢>
No other medicine has such a rcconi of cures of female troubles
or such hosts of grateful friends. *Â»ffl!
Do not be persuaded that any other medicine is just as good.
Any dealer who asks you to buy something else when you go into
his store purposely to buy Lydia E. Finkham'i Vegetable Compound,
has no interest in your case. He is merely trying to sell you some-
thing on which he can make a larger profit. Me docs not care
whether you get well or not, so long as he can make a little more
money out of your sickness. If he wished you well he would
without hesitation hand you the medicine you ask for, and which he
knows is the best woman's medicine in the world
Follow the record of this medicine, and remember that these
thousands of cures of women whose letters arc constantly printed
in this paper were not brought about by " something else," but by
Lydia Em Pinkham' s Vegetable Compound,
Tho Groat Woman's Romcdy for Woman's Ills,
Those women who refuse to accept anything else are rewarded
a hundred thousand times, for they get what they want â a cure.
Moral â Stick to the medicine that you know is Best. ,&
When a medicine has been successful in restoring
to health more than a million women, you cannot
well say without trying it, " I do not believe it will
help me." If you are ill, do not hesitate to get a bot-
tle of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound at
once, v and write Mrs. Pinkham, Lynn, Mass., for
special advice. It is free and helnfui.We have made a very low round-trip rate
to tha Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo,
and the comfortable Nickel Plate trains, with
Nickel Plate . dining ."cars serving: American
dub meals at 35c to Jl each. Insure you a
pleasant trip. Book free showing Pan-Amert
can views. Buffalo hotel accommodations re
served. JAY W ADAMS. P.. C. P. A.. SI

New York Aldermen arc discussing the advisability
of adopting an ordinance prohibiting persons from
standing in open street cars, but until some means
has been found to cure the American habit of rushing
during Â¦ business hours it will be very hard to pre
vent them from taking the first car that comes even
if they have lo stand and^ crowd cverybody^else.
It is said the Game Warden of New York has found
so many game birds hidden " away in cold storage
plants as to make the penalty money for violation of
the law amount to upward of $1,000,000; and if any
thing like that sum can be collected the game law
Â¦will have to be classed as one of the best revenue pro
ducers on the statute-books.
In New England there has been invented a new
drink called "stretch." It is said, to be composed of
water, hard cider and alcohol, and according to re
ports is about the most diabolical thing ever devised
in the country.

WIRELESS COAST SIGNALS.
SIGNOR MARCONI is reported to have stated
in a recent interview: "All the principal head
lands on the British and Irish coasts are now
equipped with wireless telegraph apparatus, most of
it with a radius of 200 miles."
Such activity on the .part of the Â«British Government
in a matter of that kind should stimulate action on the
part of the Government of the United States. It
may be that the need of such signals Â¦ on/'our coasts is
not quite so great as it is in Great Britain, whose
coasts are nearly always enveloped in fogs and whose
narrow seas swarm with shipping; but none the less
there are certain parts of our coast where an equal
need exists. San Francisco, for example, is the cen
ter of a vast shipping industry and fogs are frequent,
so that even if we do not undertake at once to estab
lish wireless signal stations on every notable head
land they should be established here at least and at
other important Pacific Coast ports.
. The Call recently directed attention to the estab
lishment of a wireless telegraph service by the New
York Herald at Nantucket lightship, and in comment
ing upon it pointed out the advisability of having such
a service between San Francisco and the Farallones.
The issue is deserving of more than passing notice.
It is known that ships frequently have to wait outside
the" heads for many hours before .venturing to enter
the port; in foggy weather. A wireless signal service
would enable information of the arrival of such ships
to be promptly sent to the city, and thus an immense
benefitwould be conferred upon commerced
The. matter should be taken up by the Chamber of
Commerce, the Merchants' Association and other, in
fluential bodies. The Marconi system* is no longer
an experiment. It is now an established method of
signaling, and its value is no. longer deniable. Cer
tainly the United States should not' be the last of
civilized nations to adopt the system, nor should San
Francisco be the last important port in the world to
have the benefit of it. â¢ ' - * -
HOME-SEEKERS' EXCURSIONS.
WITH the new management of the Southern
Pacific road there have already come evi
dences of a new policy in dealing with Cali
fornia. Efforts are being made to increase travel to
the State from the East and to bring to us not only
tourists but home-seekers.
To that end it has been announced that arrange
ments have been completed to run a number of excur
sions from Chicago to California during the summer
months. The trains will leave on the firsthand third
Tuesdays of June, July, August and September, and
will be known as "the home-seekers' excursions."
The fare from Chicago to!any California point will be
$64 50 for a first class round'trip ticket, from St. Louis
and New Orleans $59.56, 'and $52 from Kansas City.
These tickets are good for twenty-one days after date
of sale, and stop-over privileges are allowed along the
entire line of the Southern Pacific Company's system
traveling westward in California, , but no stop-overs
will be allowed on the return trips.
The railroad men have sanguine expectations of the
results of the. excursions, 1 based upon results obtained
from what is known as the colonist rate, which is said
to have induced upward of-20,ooo persons to visit the
State. It is probable the new excursions will bring
even larger numbers, though .of course they will have
to face the competition of the Buffalo Exposition,
which will naturally attract many persons : who might
otherwise have decided to take advantage of the cheap
rates to make a holiday trip to California^ .
All excursions of' the kind are bound to be helpful.
They bring California nealer to .the East so far as
expense goes, and thus obviate one of the difficulties
which has hitherto stood in the way of people of.or
dinary means who'have had desires to see the Golden
State but have not been able to do so. ' . -
Along with the new : policy of increasing travel by
augmenting the inducements and lowering the rates it
is to be hoped there will come an improvement in the
depot in this city. The structure that stands" there to
receive visitors to the metropolis of the Pacific Coast
has done all the'duty that ought to be imposed upon
it. The time has come to "clear it away and erect a
depot not tinworthy of comparison with those" of the
great cities in the East.
FIFTY-THREE members of the Iroquois Club
met recently at Benicia and told the Democratic
party of the State what it is to believe and fight
for until the club gets together again and increases or
diminishes the party creed.
The immortal fifty-three, led by Clitus'Barbour, in
formed the party that it must believe in state com
munism, and in the public ownership of about all the
agencies and activities of business and production.
Looking over the several extensions, additions,
lean-tos and declarations of the party creed in this
State, we find that it stands now for free silver at 16
to I, for an unlimited issue of irredeemable paper cur
rency, for abolition of national banks, for destruction
of the independence of the courts, for denial of the
executive veto, for destruction of private ownership
of land, for destruction of the legislative branch of the
Government, *and for public ownership and adminis
tration of public utilities, transportation, production
and distribution. It will be seen that it only remains
for the party to express its programme in the simple
motto of Nicholas Bakounin and the anarchists,
"Down with law; everything belongs to everybody."
Yet the rank and file of the. party wonder why.
business men, and men who, by thrift, temperance and
industry, have gained property, reject its principles
and antagonize its candidates.^-'
Speaking from a Republican standpoint, we do not
hesitate to declare that it is unfortunate that Jhe prin
ciples of the Democracy have been wrested from their
former conformity to the constitution and have be
come distinctly revolutionary, not only in respect to
our system of government but in respect also- to the
social institutions of the people? .......
The present party programme and principles so far
outrun the old sandlot creed as to invest it with the
features of a reasonable and quite innocuous political
movement.
Let any reasonable man consider the effect upon
the business, the property, employment and rights of
the people of the success of a party committed to
such policies!
It is not a wholesome political condition, either for
the party in power o^ the country, and will neces
sarily, it seems to us, lead to a renewed attempt at re
organization of the Democracy, or the formation of a
new party by which the conservative 'Democrats will
attempt to get the party back to a speaking acquaint
ance with the constitution, and at one with the wel
fare of the country- . â¢'. Â» > .?'â¢"
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.
UNTIL thcjuil text of all the opinions in the insular cases, 'decided by tfie Supreme
Court, is 'at hand it is hardly possible to correctly estimate the full effect of the
court's 'judgment In the outline as at present presented/ the- decision excludes
Porto Rico and the Philippines and declares them, to use the language of the Louisiana
treaty negatively, not a part of the Union of the United States. In brief the court decides
that the constitution does not follow theflag, Upon this point both the majority and mi
nority of the court tread upon ground that is clearly dangerous, and both cliicloie'a situa
tion that will nrouse the solicitude of, the country and supply our future politics with an
issue of transcendent Importance, Its bearing upon the interests' of the people is far
greater than thnt of the question of ilavcry, .
If the majority opinion hnd decided the folhnrls to be wholly, under the entire < i on
stitutlon and & part of the Union of the United States, then they would Imvo been poten
tial States, their people full citizens nnd their territory equipped for admission as full States
into the Union. As our readers arc nwnre we have regarded tills as one of the great dan
gers inherent in the annexation of these possessions, If once declared potential States
there arose the risk oi incorporation into our citizenship of many millions of t people, alien in
race, constitution, character and customs, non-assimilable, with tropical characteristics
and labor system unfriendly to our American characteristics and system.
The great issue in our future politics will be, the final disposition of these islands and
their people. This issue iÂ§ distinctly raised in the court's opinion, in which this language oc
curs: "Whatever may be finally decided by the American people as to the status of these
islands and their inhabitants â whether they shall be introduced into the sisterhood of
States, or be permitted to form independent governments â it does not follow that in the
meantime, awaiting that decision, the people are in the matter of personal rights unpro
tected by the provisions of our constitution and subject to the merely arbitrary control
of Congress." ,
It will be seen that by the first half of that sentence the court clearly remands the
case to the people, for trial and decision, as a political issue purely. The latter part of
the sentence will leave an unpleasant impression upon the lay, mind when interpreted by
this sentence which follows: "Large powers must necessarily- be entrusted to Congress in
dealing, with these problems, and we are bound to assume that they will be judiciously
exercised. That these powers may be abused is possible. But the same may be said of its
powers under the constitution, as well as outside of it." : .
This seems to be a clear admission by the court that the powers permitted to Con
gress in external government are outside the constitution, and if so, of necessity arbi
trary and plenary. . .
This will be held to be dangerous ground, since it 'is hard for the people, accus
tomed to witness the limitations of their government by the constitution which creates it,
to conceive of its exercise of powers outside that limitation. - x
~- The decision validates the Foraker act, imposing duties on Porto Rican products
imported into this country, and upon. the products of '.his country exported to Porto Rico.
No doubt a rehearing will be asked upon this p6int, and we venture the opinion that it will
be upon ground not touched in Â£he majority decision.
At the close of the Civil War Congress put an export tax on cotton. The t consti
tutionality of an export tax was carried to the Supreme Court, which voided the law, de
claring it to be the exercise of an unconstitutional power by Congress. â¢ This was so ob
viously correct that the court's decision has never been questioned. '. â¢
The majority decision on the island cases limits Congress to its constitutional pow
ers only, in. dealing with the States of the United States, and the people and products there
of. But it upholds Congress in putting a tax upon the products of the States of the United
States when exported to Porto Rico, a part of the territory of the United. States. This
tax is in effect an export tax upon our products. Such conclusion seems clear. The
prohibition of such lax upon exports to the general markets of the world seems clearlv to
include prohibition of such tax to any special market, whether within or without the ter
ritory of the United States. Â¦ , ,
The constitution says (section 9, article I), "No tax or- duty shall be laid on.ar
ticles exported from any State." This is in the statement of powers forbidden to Con
gress. . . , '.-
, Now, granting the doctrinq of the island decision, that Congress" may 'lay a duty
upon articles imported into the States from Porto Rico and the ; Philippines, how can the
same Congress lay ;> duty upon articles exported from the States into those islands? Re
member that in the laying of such duty it is dealing with the States of the United Slates,
over which its power is by no means enlarged a hair's breadth by this decision; #
No doubt this very interesting issue will reach the court soon or late, and must be
decided in the light of the cotton tax decision.
As we have said ,.the decision leaves the final disposition of the islands to the peo
ple, the source of political power, as a political question entirely, and the court affirms
that the islands are alienable and maybe permitted their independence if the people
choose. " ;. .

THE ISLAND DECISION.

P Very small outlay of money is necessary,
to render a room attractive. One of. the
most memorable transformations I recall
was that of a gloomy primary room with
hieh walls and ceiling which the credu
lous averred had once been white, bound
ed on all sides by a blackboard with up
per half above the children's reach, shade
less windows, black hissing steam pipes
and badly- scratched desks arranged in
S T^iis in a ' short time" was transformed
into a kindergarten with terra cotta walls,
elided steam coils, newly varnished desks
arranged to leave an open square in the
middle of the vcom, in which were placed
a rug two' small rocking chairs, and a
table with a pretty cover. By the use of
colored crayons the' upper portion ef the
blackboard became .a dado - of vines and
flowers and one â¢ section of â¢: the black ex
panse became a charming opera. box with
rich velvet- hangings. The -staring win
dows were covored with shades and with
daisy-chain' curtains Â¦ made by the -,chil
dren The Â¦ ugly â¢ pulpit from which the
former teacher. bad dispensed learning. and
threats was replaced by a; long, sloping
table' at which the 'little ones might rest
themselves by standing at their work/
The older Â¦ children; : who had : come into
thisvery room as into a prison where, they
were 'kept i n . straltjackets, now danced
merrily in and welcomed, their visiting
friends as in , their ' own .-;' drawing-room.
Even I the dirty little -tatterdemalion who
was , accustomed to ; pick the ââ¢ pockets Â¦ of
his - f ather'a . drunken guests began to say
"Please v excuse ; me"â in , very . grudging,
shamefaced - manner 'Â¦ at ; first â and- finally,
came ' with ; clean : face and new , garments
to .take, his .place among -those -. who -de

Â¦Â¦For "this T is what:, the: clubs' are doing

Of all the efforts of club women on be
half of school children none has met with
more conspicuous success than that for
the beautifying of the rooms and grounds,
and for the provision of- libraries and
works of art. Every -device has been re
sorted to in obtaining funds for this pur
pose; appeals to the directors, personal
contributions, sociables where lunchboxes
were sold to the highest bidders, dime
sociables, oyster suppers, literary and
musical entertainments, book and picture
receptions and a score of other schemes.
In one town of small size and large heart
625 books were contributed at" a single
book reception. In another still smaller
town $229 for the frescoing of the rooms
were the receipts for a single presentation
of "Little Red Ridinghood" by the school
children. Â¦ M '. Â¦' Â¦'Â¦'' Â¦ â¢ .*.
â¢In the decoration of schoolrooms the
first requisite is a clean room with tastily
tinted walls. Rooms have thus been made"
attractive without picture or bust; while
on the other hand a masterpiece of, art
hung on a dingy wall, so far from culti
vating the artistic sense, merely intro
duces the disturbing element of incongru
ity The most perennially pleasing pic
ture I have ever seen in a schoolroom was
a large blackboard drawing illustrating
Trowbrldge's "Midsummer": Â¦
IHcoration of Schoolrooms.
The clubs have fostered kindergartens
and nurseries where mothers who are
wage earners may leave their babes and
little ones, feeling sure that they are in
better hand3 than their own.
The evening school for those who toll
during the day and have no other^oppor
tunity to fit themselves for more lucrative
positions and the Saturday sewing and
cooking classes for % girls who have no
home facilities for learning domestic sci
ence are other enterprises initiated or ad
vanced by club women.
It may be doubted whether domestic
science and manual training should ever
have prominent place in the public
schools, since any thorough training
which would fit a girl to take charge of
a household or a boy for the trades must
necessarily be given aside from the men
tal training of the regular schools; but
at least manual ( labor in the public
schools should be carried so far as will
serve the two purposes of bridging the
gap between intellectual and physical
labor, which is creating on the one hand
an army, of drudges and on the other a
society which scorns toil; and the other
purpose of enhancing the pupil's capac
ity for mental effort and orderly conduct
by giving him physical recreation. For
we may say of disorder in the schoolroom
as Loudon said of crime on the streets,
that it is to a great extent simply a ques
tion of athletics.
The Interest of the clubs in education
has been comprehensively stated by one
of the educational committees as embracs
ing everything which touches the life,
growth and training of the child in and
out of school; sleep, diet, clothing, play,
books, and everything pertaining to his
welfare. Since nothing they have begun
is yet carried to completion, what, they
may do. is bÂ«st told by what they are al
ready doing. .
Along the legislative line in Illinois, for
example, they have secured parental
schools where disorderly pupils may be
coerced for their good without demoraliz
ing the regular schools. They have insti
tuted a juvenile court to dispose of chil
dren who have committed their first of
fenss without sending them to the reform
school to be made worse by association
with expert offenders. They have rescued
from factory labor children under four
teen and have insisted . upon factory in
spection to protect them from needless
danger to life and limb. They have pro
cured mofe rigid enforcement of compul
sory education laws; have advocated the
removal of children between the ages of
two and sixteen from poorhouses, so that
youthful . association with the feeble
minded and insane might not throw a
clou'd over their whole "future lives; and
they have labored zealously, though thus
far unsuccessfully, for an anti-cigarette
law to prevent children from impairing
their physical and mental abilities. And
much more.

nesses, the stronger to me is the proof

If club women do not always take them

prises have bloomed and faded bearing

About Clubs for Boys.
Every mother of a boy must hnve ob
served that ns they grow older the lads
who as children uaed to come frcoly Into
the hoUBo-to play with her son become
shy and hang around outside whistling for
him, but never venturi.-jg to ring the bell
and ask for him. As'chlldren they had no
cortscloua personality, vere wholly intent
on absorbing the universe. But when a
boy uees his feet protruding too far below
his trousers legs and his hands shooting
out awkwardly beyond his coat sleeves he
becomes uncomfortably aware that ho
has a body and an identity. He is no
Jonger a child;' neither is he a man, and
ho feels ill at e.ise in the presence of hi3
elders, j He needs a Uttle wholesome let
ting alone till he has time to get acquaint
ed with himseli' and adjusted to the new
conditions. -.<;. ,
This is the time when wise mothers ln
the clubs hold a consultation to determine
which of them . shall tun: her third-floor
dancing hall into a boys' club which they
fit up, not with "sissy" books' ard pic
tures of seraphs, but with bearskin rugs,
stags' heads, gymnastic apparatus and a
big dog to join In the sports.
There is still the widest latitude for
work in the line of clubs, reading rooms
and playrooms for the children of the
tenement districts. We do not appreciate
their hunger for amusement. In the long
winter evenings there should be a club
room within walking distance of every
boy and girl whose home offers no oppor
tunities for pleasant and profitable recre
ation and there are many/ society halls,
schoolhouses and churchesnn these locali
ties standing in dumb yet eloquent pro
test at their own Idleness.
Workshops, sewing and cooking schools,
reading and clubrooms are the recreative
necessities of winter time. In summer,
which is the period of maximum physical
and minimum mental development, the
children should live out of doors. At this
very moment when clubs are adjourning
and schools are closing there is pressing
need for activity among city clubs In
arranging for vacation, schools and
playgrounds. The city 'already has parks,
boulevards, roof gardens and ball
grounds, but these are for children, who
can spare 10 cents for car fare and are
barred from the little ones who have
greatest need of them.-'
In the city slums are thousands of chil
dren turned loose during. the summer va
cation with no alternative but to play in
dirty alleys among malodorous garbage
boxes. They never see a bit of green
sward, their homes are unfit for human
habitation, the streets are no better, the
mortality during the heated term is
frightful. , The adults who can do so find
their -way to the parks, remaining there
until driven -out 'by. the police at mid
night. During an : exceptionally hot-rsea
son so many of these.people, bagged; to, be
allowed to sleep on the . grass . all night
that the authorities relaxed the regula
tions and permitted them 'to -stay. Mos
quitces and night fogs â¢ were . bliss com
pr.red to the stifling rooms and nauseat
ing Qdors of their hoines.
Vacation Schools and > Playgrounds.
But the little children "sweltered in the
tenements night and day,* and for them
clubwomen co-operating - wrth philan
thropic individuals and corporations have
opened vacation schools and playgrounds.
Boston established the first playground
twelve years ago. Baltimore, Philadel
phia, Providence,' New York and Chicago
all maintain them,, but the supply ia in
adequate to meet the demand. 1 The care
takers say they get along very* well when
th^re are not more than 200 or -300 chil
dren for one teacher, but when there are
more they have difficulty in maintaining
order and directing the games. Babies in
their carriages, brought by older chil
dren, are . centers of attraction and are
well tended by motherly little girls.'
When the first vacation schools were
opened in Chicago in 1898 by the women's
clubs 6000 children applied for admission.
As there were but five ' schools, nearly
two-thirds of them had to be turned
away, it becoming necessary in one case
to call the police to control the crowd -of
parents and children " demdTiding admis
sion. Â« The number enrolled was 2450, mak
ing an 'average, of .490 "pupils to each
scaool. During the summer 12,000 children
were taken on excursions. â¢ Some of them
living in the heart. of Chicago, had never
before taken a ride on the streetcars.
Simultaneously with â¢ the vacation
schools the club committee opened six
playgrounds and schoolhouse basements,
putting into the former, wherever space
would admit, Â¦ running tracKS, baseball,
sand bins, seesaws, parallel bars and
shaded benches. At first the children held
aloof, thinking â¢ that 'they would be ex
pected to pay for the privilege of coming
They were accustomed to have* these
buildings and grounds closed to them dur
ing vacation. -But when they were made
to understand that they were welcome
without money and without price they
flocked to the grounds.
- But to-secure the greatest refreshment
for the body and soul nothing equals the
trip to the countryâ the real country
where there is room for the children to get
entirely away even from one another. The
city child needs solitude as much as he of
the country needs contact with his kind.
We have no right to expect a boy to be
come a single-minded, -upright man who
has never in his life lain on the grass all

Mav "0 1M1. This notice was jtiven to the
cress and published all over the United States
Canada and Mexico, and has been reasserted
frr.rr time to time ever since.
On'lp?n I 1901.. the machÂ»nl S t9 of San Fran
cisco and locality sent out a notice In the form
of an tKreement statins what we desired to
evefy employer of machinists. These were duly
s^ed by the president and secretary of ths
delation with the seal attached. This no-
UÂ«Â° C gave ih? employers to May 1 to confer
the proposition and give us an answer It also
stated that should there be any part of the
aireÂ«nent that they did not understand or
wiir^o confer with us about we would be
pleased to meet them and explain our posit Jon.
After the serving of our agreement, the var
lotw trade unions concluded to make similar
demands and formed an association of repre
Â«ISatives from each trade union, known as
the Iron! Trades Council, comyisln? the fol
lowing Trades: Machinists, boilermakers. pat
ter^Tia'ters molders. blacksmiths, coremakerj
a^dâ¢teaBTfitt^. Our employers were served
wUh notices virtually the same as those pre
viouslyÂ«ent out by the machinists and author
izins the above councils discuss and settle
for eac" and all. From outward appearances
theslnotices were Ignored until April J?. when
notices were rosted on the bulletin boards of
the various shops in this city, and in most
Instances without si K natures. as tollowjj:
"Realizins the importance, of harmony be
tween the management and the employes of
this shop, and havins received a communica
tion from the International Association of
Machinist* containing certain demands and
not knowing whether these demands are in
accord with the wishes of the men in tne
shops? we therefore Invite one representative
man of the shop to meet us at Ruby Hall. CD
PoÂ«t street on Tuesday. April 30. at 1:30 p. m
for the purpose of presenting any . grievance
they may h^re and to consider any suggestion
that may be offered for our mutual Interest
'"in Inswer to the employers* notice twenty
seven men were chosen by the several rtiojps
to meet the employers as requested at Ruby
Hall at the appointed time. They were received
by the Manufacturers' Association In succes
sion It seemed that they were an organized
body with a president, secretary, i stenograph
er and sentinel, who demanded from the men
credentials from their employers before they
were allowed to be seated. The employers had
neglected to furnish these, so the men were al
lowed to be seated upon being vouched for by
their spokesman. A programme had ben ar
ranged, with Â» a list of questions that were to
be asked trie men individually, and. their an
swers taken by the reporter. To this mode of
procedure the spokesman demurred, and he
stated that they were there to answer questions
asked ln the notice posted presumably by them,
and not there to answer questions or discuss
anytnlnff appertaining to the agreement they
had received from I. A. of M. : that they slm
pÂ£? represented the men in the shops, and
were not there as representatives of the Ma
chinists' Association; that a committee of the
Iron Trades Council were awaiting In the ante
room who had authority to discuss and settle
that The spokesman told them that 90 per
cent* of the men In their shops were member*
of the I A of M.; that the agreements sent
out by the unions were in accord with the
wJ-hes of the men in the shoo: that they had
nothing further to say on the subject, and
would retire and give them an apnortunity to
discuss the matter with the committee in the
anteroom. This ended the conference.
The next conference was held between the
men ln the shop, through their committee, with
the employers In the offices, who told them that
they could not settle the matterâ that It would
h&ve to be done through their executive board.
The dav of the strlkw. at 9 o'clock, a commit
tee of the men went to the flfflce and gave them
one more chance to say what they would do.
The answer was "Nothing." ThÂ« men. struck
a< As to*the agreements sent out thera is noth
ing ln them that states who the employer shall
hire or Â¦ discharge or anything outside of tha
apprentice clause that they have seriously ob
jected to. but they have refused to discux* thÂ«
agreement with the unions In. any of itsT>ear-
Ines The unioaa are 'simply asking for a
shorter work day without any reduction of pay
and a fixed schedule for overtime work.
This covers the situation up to the present
time Since the. strike the actions of the men
speak' for them. They quietly quit their work
and have attended - strictly to their -business
ever' since and are perfectly willing, to rest
their case with the pubHc. -

THE British bark Cambusdoon is
at last cleared and ready to sail.
For five days she has been tied up
in the stream and Captain Robert3
was beginning to think he would
never get away. A very unwelcome guest
in the shape of a United States Deputy
Marshal ran thines to suit himself and
Until he cave the word the Britisher had^
to remain at anchor. .
The Cambusdoon came here from Ant
werp with a general cargo. Among It was
considerable cement and sqms whiskv.
The voyage around the Horn was a' long
one and during some of the cold nights
the crew broached cargo and when the
vessel arrived some of the whiskv was
missing. The cement also was damaged
and the consignees refused to accept de
livery. The case was carried into the
United States courts and the work of dis
charging went on. When comoleted the
Cambusdoon was taken- to Port Costa,
where 60,346 centals cf wheat valued at
$63,520 was put aboard, and last Thursday
Ihe vessel came down ready to sail. The
case in court had not been settled, how
ever, and the plaintiff,, fearing the bark
would sail away and leave him without
recourse, put a United States Marshal
aboard to hold her.
This did not please Captain Roberts,
while the charterers of the vessel madt? a
vigorous protest against her being held.
Grumbling did no good, however, and
finally the matter was amicably arranged
yesterday and the Cambusdoon will sail
to-day. A crew has been secured, the
sails are bent, and if everything goes -well
the Cambusdoon will be on her way to
Cork for orders at noon to-day.
The Cambusdoon took 175 days to come
here from Antwerp, but- Captain Roberts
is in hones of clipping a month oft that
time in the run home.

Diving for Lost Tools.
When the superstructure on Arch Rock
was damaged during a recent storm a
considerable quanity of tools and machin
ery was lost. Four drills went to the
bottom, part of one of the pumps went
down and a number of small toois wer^
lost. Divers are now -&t work and yester
day two cf the drills were recovered. As
iho drills came out of the holes the lo
cation of these latter were lost and they
have to be found again. When found
cnius of powder connected by an electric
wir? will be put down and these will re
main In position until the rock is ready
t-j be blown up. It Is expected that all
the lost tools and machinery will be re
covered by the end of the week.
British Bark Cambusdoon, Loaded and Ready to Sail, Has Been
Detained Five Days Because a Difference Over Some Damaged
Cement Could Not Be Settled to the Consignee's Satisfaction
PREVENTED FROM LEAVING PORT

and in consequence they are seeking for
seme one on whom they can pour out the
vials of their wrath. Some time ago the
Union arranged a schedule of wages to
which, after some wrangling, the em
plovers agreed. The new scale called for
50 cents an hour and $1 for overtime,
Sundays and legal holidays. Had the ta
ble prepared by the Union rested there ail
would have been well, but it goes on to
name the holidays and among them
Memorial day is not mentioned. The
men want a dollar an hour for working
on Thursday, but the bosses point to the
c&xO. and say it only calls for 50 cents, and
so the matter rests for the present.

FOB AMERICAN COLLEGE
Before the meeting of the convention in
Confederate Hall, the Confederate Ladies'
Memorial Association held in Calvary
Church a memorial meeting for Jefferson
Davis, at which a memorial address was
delivered by Bishop Thomas F. Gailor of
the Episcopal Church. ' Â¦' â¢ ,
The exercises of to-day were almost en
tirely confined to the welcoming addresses
delivered by the Â¦ representatives of the
people of .Memphis and of the State of
Tennessee, and by members of different
organizations affiliated with the United
Confederated Veterans. The only actual
business performed was the completion of
the organization and the ap
pointment of the committees on-resolu
tions and credentials. The committee on
resolutions will favorably report to the
convention to-morrow a. resolution sug
gesting that steps be taken to prevent
men. who were deserters from the Con
federate army, from procuring member
ship in the organization.
The sixth annual reunion of the Unit
ed Sens of Confederate Veterans was
called to order in the auditorium at 1:45
o'clock to-day by the Right Rev. Bishop
Thomas Gaylor, of Memphis. The auditori
um was beautifully decorated with the
National colors, while over the stage hung
pictures of General Stonewall Jackson,
General Robert E. Lee, General N. B. For
rest and others who had been leaders In the
Southern Confederacy. At the rear of the
stage, sitting in a semi-circle, were the
sponsors and maids of honor of the dif
ferent camps of Sons of Veterans, wear
ing various colored badges and streamers
pertaining 1 to their camps..
Division Commander James J. Bean, of
Lynchburg, Tenn., delivered the address
of welcome. In a brief address?- George
N. Myers, of Holly Springs, Miss., turned
the convention over to the commander
In chief, Biscoe Hlndman of - Louisville,
who made- a short speech and assumed
the chair. The convention took; a recess
and marched in a body to Confederate
Hall to participate in the reunion exer
cises with the Veterans.

For the past third of a century the leading scientists of Europe have recognized thÂ«
. tremendous possibilities of liquid air, provided it could be produced commercially. Twenty
years ago Professor Dewar of London produced at a cost of Â£700 a gobletful before thÂ«
Royal Academy. Another English scientist. Professor Redmond, spent Â£20,000 endeavoring
to produce it. A French syndicate, headed by Vlctorien Vicy of Paris, expended 1.500,000
franca endeavoring to accomplish the same purpose, but it remained for an American to
. succeed where scientists of Europe had failed*
When Professor Tripler commenced his efforts to produce liquid air commercially it
was costing $o0G0 a gallon. Now, after an expenditure of J2CO.0CO and constant efforts for
seventeen years, it is produced at the company's large new works in New York City and
Washington at 5 cents a gallon.
During the past six months- the development of liquid air .
has equaled the progress made in the early history of electricity
in the first six years, as is proven by the successful operation by
this company of liquid air refrigerator cars on the Vanderbilt
system, and the erecting of a large refrigerating plant for the
Ballentine Brewery of Newark, N.J., which includes the supply-
ing of their refrigerator cars and the operating of 80. delivery
wagons as auto-trucks, utilizing liquid air as the motive power.
This company is operating daily on the streets of New York,
Washington and Paris its automobiles propelled by liquid air at
a cost of two-thirds of a cent per mile, capable of making a mile
a minute, and with a total weight of vehicle/ motor and liquid air
of only 600 pounds, charged to go 100 miles.
It is producing a light so brilliant that it is impracticable to
look at it with the naked eye, and 1000 candle power is being pro-
duced at the present cost of 1 6 C. P. electricity and 20 C. P.
gas. It is installing a 40.000 C. P. light in the heart of New
York City at the Central Park Circle.
Practical tests have proven that it will effect great economy in the metallurgical Indus- ' .
' tries, saving a large percentage of the coke consumed in the smelting Industry- which,
when it becomes in general usage, will amount to several hundred thousand dollars a day. to
redound to the profit of this company.
When combined with hydro-carbon it produces an explosive equivalent to dynamite at
a small fraction of the cost. In the commercial production of gases, such as oxygen, hy-
drogen, nitrogen and carbonic gases, it is capable of production at S3 per cent of the
present cost.-
Liquid air is the most natural refrigerant in the world, being
312 deg. below zero. What electricity has accomplished as a
motor power in metropolitan' traction vs. steam applied through
cable, supplying a more satisfactory power at 40 per cent of the
cost, is now being duplicated by liquid air to replace the present
ammonia, brine, sulphuric acid and ice systems. This means in
the course of time, the saving of 60 per cent of the cost under
the present systems, for which there was expended last year in
the United States $170,000,000, thus effecting a gross earning
of $100,000,000, which, if this company should receive but 15
per cent of the same, would amount to $15,000,000 per an-
num, or the equivalent of 150 per cent interest on its entire capi-
tal stock from the refrigerating industry alone, not to mention
its application to the balance of the world.
The parent company is establishing throughout Â¦ the entire world licensee companies â¢
owning Irom 33 per cent to 45 per cent of each, among which there are now being rapidly
formed such State companies as New York, ?2,OCO,000 capital; New Jersey, $1,000,000; Ohio.
?2,0O0,C00; California. $1,000,000..
As an indication of the Character of the gentlemen constituting these companies we
publish herewith the names of some of the directors and principal shareholders of the Call-
' fornia company:
HOMER LAUGHLIN, Los Angeles, Owner LAUGHLIN POTTERY
WORKS, Ohio. 4
W. F. BOTSFORD, Los Angeles, President California Bank.
FRANK P. FAY, Los Angeles, President Fay Fruit Company.
ROBERT GRAHAM, Los Angeles, Manager FRUIT-GROWERS'
. EXPRESS (Armour & Co.).
This company was organized and its works are now being built in New York for the
refrigeration of transcontinental fruit cars by liquid air, effecting a saving of $60 per car
(28,0CO fruit cars were shipped East last year>. Â« -
From the above facts one can judge of the great future of
liquid air, which is manufactured by this, the only liquid air com-
pany in the world. This company absolutely dominates the pat-
ent situation, having expended upward of $100,000 in the pro-
curing of the same, in every country in the world granting patents
As one among many of the great strides that are being rapidly made the company
opened last month' its new 250 horsepower works, at a cost of about $100,000, in Washing-
ton, D. C. . .
. Undoubtedly the financial results attained by other great sole process discoveries, such
as the Westlnghouse Air Brake, Mergenthaler Linotype, the Bell Telephone and the early
electrical companies, all of whose securities have advanced many thousands per cent, will
be more than duplicated within a short space of time by the TRIPLER LIQUID AIR
COMPANY. -

STOCK MARKET.
' NEW YORK, May 28.â There was some show
of strength and activity to-day in Union Pa
cific and in Lackawanna, which had consider
able sympathetic effect in the railroad list.
There was fosiÂ» independent strength shown by
a number of minor railroads, and finally there
was a hetereogenous assortment of minor in
dustrial stocks which advance on the influence
of Individual causes not always disclosed. There
was besides some natural recovery from de
clines of yesterday under the see-saw opera
tions of the professional group of traders, who
continued largely In control of the market.
The movement in Lackawanna. coming on top
of its previous advance of late, carried the
price up to-day a*s high as 241. The fluctua
tions were rapid and wide and the volume' of
dealings was comparatively small, eo small
in fact as to preclude the supposition of buy
ing for control in the open market. The ex
planation generally agreed upon was that
negotiations were on foot to secure large hold
ings at privcate agreement and that the bid
ding up of the stock represents efforts to put
the prices up to prohibitive figures on the part
of the Insiders who oppose a change of con
trol. That policy was successfully pursued
some time since m the case of Delaware and
Hudson, and that stock showed some sympathy
to-day with the Lackawanna movement. The
coalers otherwise were rather quiet. The
strength of the Wabash and Missouri Pacific
and the Southwesterns generally was related
to the Lackawanna movement, as the supposed
efforts to control the latter are in the interest
of that group. There was some large buying;
both of Union Pacific and of Southern Pacific,
accompanied by rumors that further large hold
ings of Southern Pacific had been secured and
would be applied as collateral for the Union
Pacific convertible bond Issue In addition to
securities formerly held. The strength of Atch
ison. which sold ex-divldend, was attributed
to the April showing net earnings. The tobac
co flocks fell somewhat into the background
later In the day, but they were active and con
tinued to advance in the morning with a per
sistence of rumors regarding the properties.
There was ttrength in American Car and Foun
dry stocks. Brooklyn Transit. Standard Rope.
Amalgamated Copper, General Electric and
Consolidated Gas. The formal announcement
that the banking houses representing the con
test for control of Northern Pacific had given
orders to relieve any of the London shorts,
who are honestly not able to make delivery by
payment oÂ£ 15C for their contracts attracted
attention. The announcement wap accepted as
Indicating the continued' eagerness to spare
actual deliveries of th!s stock. The plans of
the Illinois Central to advance further in the
granger field and a purchase of a large Inter
est in the Ohio soft coal field reported to be
for the account of the Gould interests were
minor incidents that were thought to have pos
sible significance on the question of agreement
between the two contending - Interests. The
engagement of $1,500,000 gold for export was
not known until after the close.
Wabash debenture Bs and Standard Rope 6s
were strong and active. The railroad bond
market was generally 'dull and Irregular. Total
tales, par value. $3,780,000. United States re
funding 2s advanced Vi and new 4s % per cent
on the last call. â¢

San Joaquin Valley â The past week has been
exccplicc&lly cool, the first part clear and the
latter cloudy, with quite general rains on Fri

crops, but as a whole it is believed that more

to fill well. In a few localities some of the

Coa^t and Bay Sectionsâ Cool weather has

in aeesif all sections. In the central and
northern counties much damage has been done
by the unusual rains, principally to cut hay
and rine cherries, and in some places it Is

beneficial to hops and deciduous fruits.

Late sown grain continues in excellent con

of the Tehachapi bountiful crops of wheat

California there will be in many places a fair
yield. The early wheat is generally in good
condition, though there are some reports of
rubt and damage by rain and wind. Grain
harvesting and haying have been retarded by
the rain, but will commence with fair
vrather. Unstacked hay has been quite seri
ously damaged in many places, but the loss
cannot be safely estimated at present. Sugar
Iwets. corn, beans, alfalfa and other crops
have been greatly benefited by the recent
rains and will probably yield good crops. Hops
are in good condition, but have made slow
growth during the cool v.-eather.
The temperature has been slightly below

prevailed in most sections. Unusuallly heavy
rain has fallen in all parts of the State and

Business was hardly "resumed here -to-day. The
little market there was was heavy and feature
less! The American department continued to

that Kuhn. Loeb & Co. had cabled to their

bona fide dealers who were caught short of
Northern Pacific and unable to obtain the
stock should be allowed to settle at. the rate
of $3L3 a share. Money was a little easier.

with regard i to an interpretation of article

bly is In effect to exclude members of se

It is also Interpreted by some delegates to
mean the expulsion of members of the
church who now belong to, secret scci

was long and heate'd.- Â¦ .,:..'"

Sensational. Action , Taken, by the
There are etill a number of people in San
Francisco who are confident they can lo
cate the remains of the lost steamship Rio
de Janeiro. Over $10,000 has been spent oy
private parties on the search, but so far
Â¦without result Mrs. Young and her
friends thought the spirit of the late Cap
tain Plummer had told them the exact
gpot where the wreck lay. It cost them
$120 to prove that the spirit was wronz.
The Wiggin-Sorenson partyâ there were
ten of themâ put ud $100 each to find the
treasure. Their money is all spent and all
they have to ehow for it is a diving outfit
and a small boat. Several other parties
put money into the venture, but all ccme
out with experience but no results.
In spite of all these failures another
party has taken up the matter. A few
days ago a man named McLaren went to
the Pacific Coast Wrecking Company to
hire a diver. He wanted the best man In
the business and was willing to pay the
full price. John Roach went out with
him in a launch. When the vicinity of the
wr^ck was reached McLaren produced a
divining rod. It is formed of a long glass
tube fixed into a whalebone handle The
tube was full of gold nugtrets worth ovt-r
S5O-3. bo lioach says. McLaren held the rod
in both hands and stretched it out ever
the waters. The boat was then stajted
slowly, and moving in an ever widening
circle, soon covered a lot of sna?e. When
the place where the spirits said the wieck
Js located was reached the divining rod
dipped and McLaren said. "The remains
of the City of Rio de Janeiro are tnere."
Roach at once erot into his divins suit and
went down. He stayed down half an hour,
but failed to find any trace of the wrect.
He so informed McLaren and that ended
the search. The man with the divining
rod is not satisfied, however, and is soing
to have another try.

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Mav 28.â T v .e
trip of the Presidential train from Omaha
eastward to-day across Iowa was practi
cally without incident. It was made over
the Chicago and Northwestern and, to
avoid the crowds at the stations, engines
and train crews were changed a few miles
from the end of each division. Few slops
were made, but the train was slowed up
at the principal cities and towns and the
President appeared on the rear platform.
This Is Secretary Wilson's home Slate
and he shared the honors with the Presi
dent to-day. At Tama, where Mr. Wilson
formerly resided, there was a big crowd
to -greet them both, but no s<top was
made. At Marshalltown the local G. A.
R. post was lined up In the station. Â¦
Mrs. McKinley's condition has continued
to show steady but no rapid improvement
since she left San Francisco. ShÂ« is gain
ing some Â¦ strength . and the President- Is
much encouraged. Â¦ She has not .eft her
couch however. Dr. Rixey does not de
sire to have her tax her strength, but ho
permits her to sit up in bed most of the
day. The President is at her side much
of the time.
At the place where the Chicago and
Northwestern crosses the . Des Molnes
River, over the new Boone viaduct, 3aid
to be the longest and highest double
track structure in the world, the train
was halted for ten minutes to permit the
photographers with the party to take sev
eral group pictures of the President, Cabi
net and newspaper men. The train is due
to reach :.Chlcago about 3 o'clock to-mor
row morning. It will not run' into the
station, but will be switched to the track*
of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the out
skirts of the city and proceed directly to
Washington. At Canton to-morrow a stop
of twenty or thirty minutes will be made
to permit- some of the relatives and friends
of the President and Mrs. McKinley to
come aboard .

Chinese Slave Cases Decided.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday overruled .the appeal of Lyman
I. Mowry in the case of Fong Mey Yuk
and approved of the findings of Court
Commissioner Heacock that she was un
lawfully in this country and should be de
ported.
Mr. Mowry appealed on the ground that
the woman was a native born citizen of
the United States, and that therefore
Judge Heacock had no jurisdiction to try
her. From the decision of Judge de Haven
Mr. Mowry took an appeal to the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals.
Man Yin, another of the captures of the
Federal raid, was tried before Commis
sioner Heacock yesterday and was dis
charged, she having proved that she was

APPEAL MADE
FOR THE NEGRO
Address Sent to Ala
bama Constitutional
/ . Convention'.
Senator Morgan Prepares a
Solution of Suffrage
Problem.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., May 2S.-Booktr
T. Washington, in behalf of tho negro
rnco, to-day presented to the Constitu
tional. Convention an appeal for conserva
tive uctlon. Tho address reminds tho con
vention thdt , tho negroes came her*
against their will, but have been benefit
ed, trained and Christianized. They did
their duty In the Civil War and in tha
Spanish war. They have ceased for twenty
jours to b*s an offensive element in poll
tlce. Leading member* of the race have
persistently urged the negro to learn to
trust the white man.
For these men. he says, this is a crucial
time. The negro pays some direct taxea.
lie pays much more Indirectly through
his labor. He Is in the main a producer
of â¢wealth, and .generally contented and
law-ubiding. Already the emigration
agent anil exodusi associations are at work
and the negro fears that his citizenship
and schools will both bo tuken away. Tha
relations are now reasonably satisfactory
between the races. Anything that win un
settlo the negro now, when he la settling
down to thrift and common sense. woulU
injure both races. The address pleads
that all incentive lor right and useful liv
ing be not withdrawn from the young
negro. It concludes* :
"Any law which will merely changa thÂ«
nnmfl and form of fraud, or can be Inter*
preted us meaning one thing when applied
to one rare and nomethlng elxe whÂ«n ap
plied to another, will not. In our opinion,
improve preatnt rendition*, but unsettla
the neai'ft and thrift of our people and dÂ«.
â¢â¢rr-i.fc.t tho wealth end proiyerlty of AlÂ»Â«

The leading feature of the nuffrÂ«Â«Â»
flnune olTorÂ«d to-day by Â«x-OovÂ»rnor
JonfH Is that which ricml?* the right to
vote to "any poraan who Khali hflre-uttr

MOST COLOSSAL
OF CONVENTIONS
Three Halls Engaged
fpr Epworth League
â¢Meetings. \
California Is Receiving Gen
erous Advertising in
the East.
.The International convention of tha Ep
worth Leuguo, to be held In San Francisco
from July Hi to 21, Is assuming proportions
as the days go by that Justify tho predic
tions that it will bo the moat colossal of
such gatherings that the country hus
seen. Already arrangements have been
made for three convention halls, In ep.Ch
of which three meetings will bo held daily.
Mechanics' Pavilion will bo tho scene of
the great opening concert, and the various
headquarters, etc., will be there. In fact;
It will bo the main convention hall, but
meetings of equal importance will bo held
simultaneously at Metropolitan- Temple
and the Alhambra Theater.
Mechanics' PaVIHon will be very ciabo
rately decorated for the convention, moro
than usual attention being given to beau
tifying its barn-like Interior.
An exhibit of California products, ar
ranged by counties, will occupy the entire
east sido of the gallery of the pavilion,
and the counties will vie with vuch other
in artistic arrangement of their product*.
It Is estimated now that between 40/00
and CO.OOO excursionists from bnvond the
Rocky Mountains will be brought to Ban
Francisco on account of the convention
and lta cheap rates. Many of these urn
writing for ten days' accommodation and
practically all of them will be here at
hunt a week. ' '

Tho Epworth Herald, with a circulation
of 125,000, gave its whole issue of April
20 to carefully prepared nnd profusely
illustrated nrtlcles on California.
Tho Fourth General Conference District
Epworth League, comprising Pennsyl
vania and New Jersey, has issued a 86
page pamphlet, "Itineraryâ California
19Ci." It Is an attractive publication, de
voted almost entirely to California.
Stereopticon Views of California.
A stereopticon expedition has been
traveling over the Eastern States for the
ptft year, sent out by the Epworth
league, to advertlso California and the
convention.
The Brooklyn Eaglo devoted four col
umns In its issue of May 18 to the coming
convention.
The Goneral Committee has sent circu
lars with general Information concerning
the convention and California, to every
minister of the Methodist Episcopal
Church in the United States and Canada,
and through them to the presidents of all
the local Kpworth Leagues. In this way
200,000 circulars have been placed in the
hands of 20,000 men for distribution.
The music of the convention will be
most Impressive. A chorus of 200 voices
Is being trained to render the sacred mas
terpieces. Of necessity all but the final
rehearsals must be done *ln smaller
choruses." In San Francisco a chorus of
50) voices Is being drilled and In Oakland
one of 400. Los Angeles has a chorus of
200, San Jose one of 250, Stockton 200, and
Sacramento 200.
Robert Husband is chairman of tho
music committee. The grand chorus will,
be directed in different numbers by vari
ous well-known conductors.
The great organ, recently built for the
new memorial chapel at Stanford Uni
versity and made available for the con
vention by the kindness of Mrs. Stan
ford, will be put up in two sections, one
on each side of the. gallery. The organist
will be a hundred feet from the pipes.
Tho best known organists of the city will
have opportunity to test the new instru
ment during the convention.

BROOKS THINKS
MARKET IS SAFE
Natural Conditions and Scarcity oi
Tonnage Will Afford Protection
Until Congress Can Sup
ply Legislation.
"There are five leadlnsr exports from the
Philippine*," said Franklin Brooks;
"hemp, tobacco, sugar, coffee and copra.
Rice Is a great product, tout there la not
enough raised for local use and It Is nee*
essary to import rice for food.
"Just before I left Manila Mr. Mcdov
ern, manager of the Insular Tobacco Fac
tory, said that he could not nil any orders
tor shipment to the United States because
tho factory was taxed to its full extent by
European orders. I also asked the man
ager of the Alhambra Cigar Factory and
received substantially the same answer
there. The tobacco trade In the Philip
pines Is practically a monopoly. Behind
this are British capitalists who have spe
cial privileges.
"Coffee was little produced at the time
I left the islands. Sugar production was
nlso small.. owing to the destruction of the
plantations during the Insurrection.
There were large sugar warehouses at
Manila, Malabon, Uoilo and Cebu. Those
at Malabon had been destroyed. The only
one of the products mentioned that ex
ists in sufficient quantity to afTect the
price Is tobacco. Peace is practically
reigning, however, and the other products
will Increase in a period of a few month*.
The hemp trade of the Islands is In the
hands of four concerns, of which the prin
cipal ones are Warner, Barnes & Co. and
Smith, Bell & Co.
"The natural conditions existing and thÂ«
lack of tonnage on the Pacific are suffi
cient to prevent any great influx of pro
ducts from tho Philippine Islands Into thÂ«
United States at once. The regular Ori
ental lines have about all the business
they can attend to. For these reasons I
think there will not be a chance to send
forward great enough quantities of any
Philippine product to affect the American
mrrket very much before Congress can
meet to legislate and fix the dutlea."

STRANGE POINT
IN BOTKIN CASE
Will Ask United States Su
preme Court for Writ
of Habeas Corpus.
"Blow Was Struck in
Delaware" Declare
the Attorneys.
Now as to Mrs. Botkln'R case. The "fa
tal blow" that ended the life of Mrs. John
P. Dunning was "struck" In Delaware. In
the North Carolina case the bullet was
sped into Tennessee. In the Botkln case
the box of poisoned candy was sped with
the swiftness of the malls over the boun
daries of several States and at Dover.
Del., "delivered the fatal blow." Under
the authorities" cited, the Jurisdiction to
try Mrs. Uotkln lies In the courts of Dela
ware; bet as she was not In tho State of
Delaware "when the fatal blow was
struck," and had not since been there Del
aware cannot demand the right to extra
dite, her for trial.
This rleht of one State to withhold an
accused person from the Jurisdiction of
the courts of another. Mrs. Botkln's at
torneys point out. is the result of British
oppression prior to the secession of the
United States from British authority. One
of the causes for the secession was Great
Britain's action in "transporting citizens
across the peas to be tried for pretended
offenses." When the constitution of tho
United States was framed Great Britain's
action In this regard was remembered,
and hence provisions were placed in the
constitution to prevent the removal of an
accused person from one sovereign state
to another for trial, unless such accused
person was actuallyâ not constructivelyâ a
fugitive from the state demanding the de
livery of the body of the accused for trial.
In view of these precedents, Mr. Heg
gerty says that there is but one place
where Mrs. Botkln can be legally tried.
That place Is Delaware, "and," he says,
"as Delaware is a small and uninterest
ing State it Is not likely that Mrs. Botkln
will ever be tempted to wander within its
boundaries, and nothing but her own will
can ever take her there."

by Gultrau'i* c-dUimrl that the death coin

Dlntrli't of Columbia. Tho Buprtme Ootirt
held, however, that the crlmn of murder
had been oompletrd where the fatal blow
warn Ftruck. nnd tiultcjiu whs trlnt In thn
District of Columbia and executed for hiB
crime.
In the other rase mentioned a murder
was committid acroFS tho boundary line
between North Carolina and Tennessee.
The man who fired the fatal shot was in
North Carolina, the victim In Tennessee.
The Governor of North Carolina refused
to deliver uÂ» the murderer for trial In
Tennessee, it being held that as he wan
not in Tennessee at the time the shot was
fired he was not a. fuptltlve from the jus
tice of Tennessee, and hence the petition
for extradition must be denied. The mur
derer was placed on trial In North Caro
lina, however, and convicted of the mur
der committed In Tennessee. The Judg
ment was reversed by the Supreme Court.
It was held that the Jurisdiction to try
the accused lay solely In Tennessee,
"where the fatal blow was struck." Tin
refusal of the Governor of North Caro
lina to permit the extradition of the ac
cused was upheld by the Appellate Court
and as a result the accused went free,
and suffice to say rellplously avoided Ten
nessee, wherein alone the Jurisdiction to
try him for his crime lay.

: United States Commissioner George E.
Morse .filed with United States District
Judge de Haven yesterday his report in
the case of A. W. Beadle vs. the schooner
Reliance and others. Commissioner Morse
finds that Beadle is not and at the time
of the seizure " and sale of ' the schooner
Reliance was not the owner of . any - part
thereof and not entitled to any part of
the proceeds of the sale. He finds that
the Western Trading Company Is the own

schooner and entitled to that proportion
of 'the balance on hand after deducting
costs. -The .ownership/ of the. remaining
seven twenty-fourths has not been suffi

eresfeet measure of huccpm possible Jn so
?hnrt a time. The tubfluing cf a WlldemcM,
v hicli Is Â«vhnt the Montetuma has under-
taken, Is tin mean task. The expenditure
â¢ f bnth time and rncney is n?cFE&ry. Of thi
former, but a few months have been given
to the work, but with the kindly assistance
of Nature much has been accomplished; of
money, there has been sufficient for current
needs, thanks to the shareholders who In
the beginning took the Company on faith,
but who arc rewarded In the possession of
rtock at fmall cost
MORE HONEY NEEDED.
Put more time and more money will be
reeded to bring the copper mines to a eelf-
rcistalning basis. The nsoney is coming In
constantly Increasing amount, and while the
monthly payroll grows larger, not a cent
is being expended injudiciously. Every dollar
is applied under, wise and efficient manage-
ment. The "Taccma" tunnel has been driven
ir.o feet through the ore body, and work
will be hastened soon by the Introduction of
an air drill. The coal mines are being de-
veloped rapidly, forty men being 1 engaged
therein, and the water wheel and sawmill
v!ll have been installed before our excursion
rarty of shareholders and others reach the
mines. Beth coal and coke â¢will be pro-
duced in considerable quantities during the
cummer and fall.
NOT A RICH MAN'S MINE.
The title to the Montezuma Is not vested
In a few wealthy men. It was the good
fortune of a small body of poor men to get
tog-ether these properties; snd having secured
them, they, In a quiet way, did enough de-
velopment work to prove their -worth. This
being done, they were offered ample funds
for developmentâ by capitalists who wanted
a controlling- Interest But the men who had
staked bo much of their own resources on.
the Montesuma mines preferred to carry out
the original plan of making the Company
Etrjctly co-operative, and have rigidly ad-
hered to that idea. Holders of the Etock will
Fhare and â¬hare alike, and the smallest has
a voice in the management Some of the
best mines in the world were so brought to
a self-sustaining basis, and are to-day- pay-
â¢tir- handsome dividends to the fortunate
h^er* of the stock. But while the Monte-
zuma ic not a "rich man's mine," it will
create rich men and give to others a com-
fortable income. . .
FAVORED BT FORTUNE.
If ever a mining company was situated
favorably to keep operating expenses at the
lowest possible limit when the time comes
for production, that is the Montezuma. It
will mine its own coal, make Its own coke,
and burn that coke In a smelter which it
ar.d another company will build. Numerous
big veins of coal In the 2000 acres comprls-
:r.g the lease make a coke 60.45 per cent
carbon, and a ready market awaits such
surplus as may be beyond the Company's
needs. This means no smelting charges, no
profit on coke, no profit on coal, but in-
stead the desirable commodities, Â¦ coke and
blacksmi thing coal to eell.
SATISFIED INVESTORS.
A significant fact In connection with the
sale of Montezuma stock Is the complete sat-
isfaction it gives the people who buy it
Of the hundreds of small holders, not one
is dissatisfied, but on the contrary, every
one in firm in the belief that his money ia
well spent. The Monteiuma Company offers
no "get -rich-quick" inducements to prospec-
tive shareholders; It gives every man a
chance to buy to the extent of his ability or
desire in a legitimate, well-managed min-
ing company that has behind it some ex-
tremely rich properties, albeit they are for
the greater part In the rough.
OPPOSED TO DEBT.
While the Montezuma Company must and
will have money to continue the development
of their properties, they would cease work
rather than borrow on a mortgage, "No
debt?, no mortgages," is an established prin-
ciple with the Company. Better a tempo-
rary idle property than one plastered with
a mortgage. But work will go on, and more
vigorously this summer than before. They
who read and study the Montezuma pros-
pectus have full confidence In the Company,
and back that confidence with their money.
Their reward will surely come.
FIRST DIVIDENDS FROM COAL AND
COKE.
It is from the products ot the coal mines
that the first dividends will ! come. The
company has virtually promised to pay the
first dividend this autumn; and this it can
easily do by marketing a single train-load
of coal and its profitable product, coke. This
and more it can easily do; forty men are
now st work on the coal leases, driving tun-
nels, putting in machinery and preparing to
build* flumes.
The profit on this coal and coke cannot be
used to continue development on the cop-
r-er properties nor to build a smelter, as
the following resolution from the Prospectus
wi:i chow:
"Resolved. That it Is the fixed policy of
this Company to distribute as dividends to
stockholders all net profits earned by the
Company. We are opposed to the policy of
reinvesting such earnings without the con-
eent of the stockholders, believing that what-
ever benefits them conduces to the interests
of the Company." â¢
The fin-t Eurplus earnings must go to share-
holders, and additional etock be sold (at a
higher price) to bring the copper mines to
the profit-paying point. Pending the pay-
ment of this dividend, the stock will be ad-
vanced only a few cents each month, but
with the declaration of a dividend will be
placed at its true value.
A MINING EXCURSION.
Seeing is believing. We are organizing an
excursion to the mines to leave San Fran-
cisco in a special train of first-class Pull-
man cars July â¬. Some few shareholders
have already gone from California, and re-
turned delighted with what they saw. This
oxcurrlon iÂ« planned that the Investor may
he satisfied and the skeptical convinced. The
low round-trip rate of J40, Including sleeper,
will enable almost any one to ga A free
round-trip ticket will be supplied with each
Durchase of 20W shares of stock for cash or

AT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE AS THE MAN HE NOTICED STANDING
OPPOSITE THE HISLOP RESIDENCE SATURDAY NIGHT.
night before there was more than $9 left.
Pfandler had been speaking to him
during the preceding | week about his
work, and had said he could hardly keep
a man who found it so hard to under
stand what was told him. Lukherath
knew he had not long to remain in . the
factory.
Looking for Money.
Last Wednesday, while under the in
fluence of liquor, he went to the Hislop
house and had the interview with Rob
bie. It was then he took the boy Jo the
candy store, and, after buying him some
candy, offered him money for every let
ter the boy got for him. That the letter
he expected was to contain money is
shown by a statement in a letter written
to him by his brother some time ago in
which the brother says: VI can well
understand how inconvenient it is to be
over there without money, but you know,
mother would gladly send you some
money if she had any. Just keep your
self straight and do not drink and you
will get along." This looked-for letter
did not come, although Lukherath was
sure it was coming.
Tho ransacking of the premises sug
gests nothing so much as a search; a
thorough search through drawers and
closets and even pockets in every room
but the one Lukherath and his two
friends had occupied. To one familiar
with the habits of the Hislops, it would
be known that in the two hours follow
ing 8 o'clock the house would be deserted
while Mrs. Hislop and Robbie went down
to the store to walk home with the hus
band and father. The front door had a
lock that was easily forced and there was
little to prevent any one from entering and
robbing or searching through everything.
There was nd love lost between the Hls
lopa and Lukherath. for he and his
friends had practically been sent out of
the Hislon house on account of the un
tidy way in which they lived.
Murder Came Last.
That the ransacking of the house was
done before the boy was killed is appar
ent, for a hand that was red enough' to
leave its bloody trace on the wall would
surely have left others had the murderer
paused in his flight long enough to throw
open drawers and closets in order to give
a semblance of robbery as a cause for
something which robbery could only ag
gravate, and if the house had been over
turned before the murder there could be
but two reasons for Itâ robbery or, a
search.
The police say nothing was taken. It
has been reported that some trinkets are
missing, but.it is by no means certain
that they are missing as the result of the
ransacking of the house, for the Â¦ mother
THE mystery of the murder of
Robbie Hislop is this step near
er solutionâ the hatchet found
in the grass of the vacant lot is
stained with bloodâ but that is
as far as the curtain has un
folded in the last twenty-four
hours. The hatchet was found in the lot
Just opposite the Hislop house, on Haight
Btreet; on its head were found some marks
that might be blood, and now the chemist
to whom the hatchet was sent for exam
ination has returned It with the report
that the spots upon the head are blood.
Those on the trousers were found not to
be blood.
Who owns the hatchet? It is clean and
bright and not new, indicating that it was
not a hatchet that has lain xjut in the
weather, and that it has been in use is
shown by the jagged edge, more used to
nails and knots than clear wood. It is a
hatchet that should be missed, and the
question isâ to whom does it belong? Cap
tain Seymour cays he will find out if he
has to show it to every one in the city
who ever owned a hatchet.
Another fact has been added to the
mass of circumstances surrounding the
tragedy by E. James Duffey, a plumber,
whose concern for his dog led him out to
the College kennels, on Haight street, last
Saturday evening in time to see standing
opposite the Hislop house and scanning it
eagerly a man who seemed to be waiting
for some one. Duffey was shown a squad
of prisoners from the City Prison yester
day afternoon. There were six or eight in
the bunch, but he picked out one without
hesitation and said, "He is the man." The
man he picked out is Herman Lukherath,
held under suspicion of being the murder
er of Robbie Hislop.
Lukherath still stoutly affirms his inno
cence and repeats his stor>\ but there is
at least one hour which he will have to
accour.t for more fully than he has be
fore the police will let him go.
That Missing Hour.
He save he left his shop and went with
his friend Smith to a saloon, which is
kept by W. J. Sheehy, and there, he says,
he and Smith and a fellow workman from
the sausage factory drank until about
half past a o'clock. Then they left and
he and Smith went up the street while
the other man went down. He stopped
with Smith at L. Samuels' drug store, on
the corner of Ninth and Howard streets,
E.nd there Smith purchased some salve.
Then they went straight home, meeting
no one whom they knew, speaking to no
one. only delaying' now and then to look
into a window. They arrived home about
10 o'clock and went Xo bed. Smith cor
roborates this story, and the landlady of
the house In which they live says she
heard some persons talking and moving
about in their room between 9:30 and 10
o'clock Saturday night. By this state
ment Lukherath allows himself and Smith
half an hour at most to reach home.
It is not true, however, that Lukherath
and Smith left the saloon or the drug
Ptore at 9:r>0, however true it may be that
they were home at 10. They left Sheehy'3
place at not later than S:10. for their com
panion from the shop. Eichorn. was home
at Bryant and Eighth streets it 8:20.
They did not remain in the drug s>tore
more than three or four minutes, for the
prescription which Smith had ordered
about C o'clock was ready and waiting for
them. They were out of the drug store
before the heavy rain set in Saturday
nig-ht. and the rain started between
twenty and thirty minutes after 8.
Allowing it to be 8:30 when they left the
drug store, and giving them half an hourâ
iis Lukherath and Smith have themselves
dene â to do a distance a man may berry
over In ten minutes, they should havÂ«
been heme by 9, but it was not until near
ly 10 that they were heard walking around
the room, and Smith says they went to
bed as soon as they returned.
The Man With a Slouch Hat.
There was an hour lost somewhere, and
in that same hour Duffey saw a man with
a s-loi'ch hat standing on the curb oppo
site the Hislop house, regardless of wind
and rain. Duffey picked Lukherath out
of a crowd as that man. He is sure the
man he saw wore a slouch hat. Samuels,
the druggist, says Lukherath wore a stiff
hat on Saturday night. He says Smith
Â¦were a black slouch hat. wide in the brim.
It was between 8:15 and 8:45 Saturday
night that Duffey says he saw the man
waiting on the sidewalk. Pfandler. the
t-ausage man. for whom Lukherath work
Â«-d, says he frequently saw Smith stand
ing outside the factory in the evening
waiting fcr Lukherath. and at first, be
cause of some similarity of form and ap
pearance, lie thought Smith was Lukhe
rath's brother.
So far, however, beyond the statement
of Duffey and the word of the distracted
father, there is nothing to connect Lukhe
rath -with the murder of the boy. As us
ual in such mysteries, rumors are flying
thick and fast and robbery, willful mur
der and perversion are all assigned as the
cause of the tragedy. Motives are being
hunted for with magnifying glasses, but
in all the mass of conditions nothing that
Â¦will fit every phase of the case has been
developed, and all theories advanced have
for a starting point the suspect under ar
rest.
Cause of the Suspicion.
While hp ha? rot been charged and will
Â¦not be charged unless more definite evi
ocTic* is presented. Lukhorath's presence
in the vicinity of the houte, or the pres
ence of his doublo. his knowledge of the
â¢prernisr-s, hir. anxiety about letters that
were to bring him money and his efforts
to have the murdered boy watch for
thoir. all make him a part of any theory
in the cast.
Lukherath was discharged from his
place in th* sausage factory Saturday
right. He had beÂ«n working there for
two months, but he had saved nothing,
for every week he was drawing advances
on his ray. He was drunk but once In
Pfandler's knowledge during- his employ
ment in .the sausagre factory and was oth
erwise steady, but he saved no money,
and when he was discharged Saturday
night Sheehy, the grocer, says the man
seemed worried over the prospect of idle
ness. He was sober when he left the fac
to-y, when he left the saloon and when
he left the drug store, and Sunday morn
ing, when he was arrested, of the $10

wept. It seemed as if they had exhausted
their tears in sorrowing for the departed
and they sat with a stolid look of grief
that was pitiful to behold.
The room was filled -with the odor of
sweet flowers sent by kind friends. Floral
pieces crowded the room. Some were sent
by relatives, some by friends and some by
the schoolmates who sincerely -mourned
the boy's untimely taking off. JJefore the
services over his remains were begun by
the Rev. E. J. Lion of St. Stephen's Epis
copal Church, who preached the sermon"
the little schoolmates of the dead
boy marched into the house and
after beholding the face of their comju(l<*>'
the boys and girls took" up their posit 1 on

not restrain their feelings and wept aloud

no condition to determine whether or not

the killing of the child after the house
had been ransacked would add nothing
to the safety* of the burglar, even grant
ing there was one. It is certain that the
boy was killed by one in a fit of frenzy, for
otherwise the two blows upon the skull
would have sufficed. The thirteen knife
cuts across the cheek tell of a man filled
with some terrible impulse,' hacking at
the nearest object to . his insane wrath.

needless. . â¢ Â¦ . *

IDENTIFIES THE
SUSPECTED MAN
Plumber Duff ey Picks Lukherath Out
of a Line of Men in the
City Prison.
. E. James Duffey, who resides at 303 Oc
tavia street, made the following statement
to. Captain. of Detectives Seymour yester
day:
Between 8:15 and 8:45 o'clock last Saturday
night, I came out . of the College Kennels at
115 Haight street, being then on my way home.
Before that I had been downtown and bought
a pair" of shoes. As I came out of the Col
lege Kennels on to Haight street I noticed a
man leaning against the billboard fence, which
is on Haight street fifteen or twenty feet be
low the College Kennels. The place where the
man was standing Is nearly opposite to the
house, 104"^ Haight street. From where he
was etar.ding, the man couldn't help but see
the house 104V4 Ha'.ght street. I don't know
just which way the Â¦ man was looking- when
I saw him. The man wore a black coat and
a black slouch hat. It was raining hard at
the time. I passed by him on the edge of
the sidewalk, and had a good look at him. I
noticed him particularly, because I wondered
why a man would .bp standing there In the
rain when there was an awning "at the store
near by. I thought that he must be waiting
for a woman. I. don't think he had an um
brella. If he did, he did not have It raised.
There Is a street light near where he was
standing, and it gave enough' light to reveal
a man* plainly at the point where he was stand
ing.
I went down Haight street about thirty-five
feet and then crossed over. The next morning
that was Sunday, I left the College Kennels
at 7 o'clock with ray dog, as I was going
across the bay .to hunt and try out the dog
After I left , the College Kennels I met the
undertaker and told him he was out pretty
early. He asked me if I had not heard about
the \ Hlslop boy being murdered last night.
When he told me that I went back and told
Barnett about it. Then I took a â¢ car down . to
the ferry and went across the bay. I bought
a. paper on the boat, and I . began to think
about the man I had seen on Haight street
Saturday night. When I came back to the
city Sunday evening I told Barnett about the
man I had- seen on Haight street Saturday
night. I told him that the^nan wore a black
hat and coat, but I don't think I said any
thing else to him about the man's description.
A lady. came into Barnett's place Sunday even
ing while I was there and I told her about the
kind of clothing the man .wore. Â¦ She said that
a lady had spoken to her about a man who
wore the same kind of clothes.
This afternoon I was in the City Prison and
was shown ' a , line of ' 6everal s men. I picked
out a man from the line and I am positive
that the man I picked out is the man I saw
standing on Haight ; street Saturday night. -Is
the man ' I - picked ' out the man 'you have under
suspicion of killing the boy? (Informed bv
Captain Seymour that the man he picked out
in the City 'Prison* is Herman Lukherath.)

It is due to the sterling honestv of Po
lice Officer John C. Edwards that MrÂ«i. 3.
Brlce of Napa, who Is visiting friends at
300 Page street, this city, is not bemoaning
the loss of her beautiful $6000 collection of
diamonds. Mrs. Brice, who is the wife of
a prominent retired naval officer, instead
of trusting to -the security of lock and
key, always carried .her jewels Jn a little
chamois bag sewed to the inner side of
her skirt. While she was out shopping
yesterday the bag became detached from
its fastenings. â¢ It fell just as she was
stepping from a Post-street car and found
lodgment on the lowest step.
It happened that Officer Edwards was
waiting for a car at the crossing of Grant
avenue with a Chinese witness whom he
was conveying to the City and County
Hospital. As he was about to step aboard
the car he noticed a package on the lower
step. Thinking that it possibly had been
dropped by a lady who boarded tho enr,
just ahead of him he picked it ud and of
fered it to her, but received an indignant
repulse for his courtesy. On opening the
bag later he discovered that it contained a
perfect wealth of diamond rings, earrings,
necklaces and brooches, a will and a let
ter.. The latter contained the San Fran
cisco address of the owner.
After Officer Edwards had discharged
his mission. and had taken the Chinaman
to the hospital he went to 300 Page street
for the purpose of restoring the jewels to
their rightful owner, but found that she
was not at home. He took the precious

packag-e to headquarters and turned it
over to Captain Seymour.
In the meantime, however, Mrs. Brlce
had discovered her loss and, almost dis
tracted, had gone to Seymour and sought
his assistance in the recovery of the jew
els. When they were, placed in her hands
she was overcome with joy.
Officer Edwards was complimented by
his chief for his honesty.

STATEMENT MADE
BY HARRY SMITH
He Tells of Lukherath's and His Own
Movements on the Night of
the Murder.
Harry Smith made the following state
ment to, the police:
SAN FRANCISCO. Cal.. May 27, 1901.
I first saw Herman Lukherath in the saloon
after 7 o'clock when he got his money. It was
past 7 o'clock when he came into the saloon on
Ninth street.* We were drinking a little beer
in the saloon. From the saloon we went to
the drug store. I was at the drug store before
I went to the shop. I went to the drug store
for salve, jjj Herman was not . in the shop. I
found, him in the. saloon. I don't know how
long we were in the saloon. We were there
about one hour drinking at the bar. There
were three of us, Herman, the man who works
with ' him in the shop and myself. - From the
saloon we went to the drug . store. Herman
was with' me. '-'I don't know what time it was.
From the drug store we went home.- We went
home by way of Market street, Oak street and
to the left on Laguna street. Herman and I
live together. Herman went to bed first and
I after. We live at 318 Laguna street. I didn't
talk to anybody on the way home. I don't
know how . long we were in the drug store. I
have no watch. My watch is at home, broken.
Herman has a watch, but he didn't look at it.
We stayed at 318 Laguna street until the po
lice came at 6 o'clock Sunday morning. There
was a woman in the next room. Mrs. Wig
gins and her sister heard us in our room at
9:30 o'clock Saturday night. I know the man
in' the drug store, but I don't know his name.
The drug store is on Ninth street I didn't
meet any one I knew on the way home. The
only person I saw Saturday night that I knew
was the man who works with Herman in the
shop. | I work for Hr. Ray on Market street.
I have lived in San Francisco for three months.
I came direct from the old country. Herman
came at the same time. I lived at 104% Haight
street. I knew the family there and the boy.
So did Herman. Herman was with me all the
time from 7 o'clock Saturday evening until 6
o'clock Sunday morning. He couldn't have left
me. I left 104% Haight streetâ on the 9th of
next month it will be two months ago. It was
a cold back room on Haight street. I have not
been there since. Herman has been there since
after letters, and he has sent little girls there
for letters. I left Haight street because I
didn't like the place.
Herman and I came from Norway together.
We were born in the same town, the town of
Seavanger, Norway. I don't know any one else
here from . that town. Herman had the knife
arid brass knuckles taken away from him here.
He got the knife back, but the police kept the
knuckles. I gave Herman the knuckles. I
used them ' In the old country in going from
town to the country. I gave the knuckles to
Herman because I had too much in my pock
et. Those are the knuckles and that is the
knife (identifying pair of brass knuckles and
dirk knife shown him by District Attorney
Byington). I got the knuckles made at a
plumber's In .Norway. The plumber's name
is Swenson. The knife belongs to Herman.
When we first came to the city we roomed j
at the Winchester Hotel on Third street. We
were there for one week. From there we
went to 104% Haight street. . I gave the
knuckles to Herman at home before we start
ed out on our trip. I never owned that knife.
Most everybody has a knife like that on him
at home. I gave the knuckles to Herman be
cause in going to the first place after leaving
home we had to pass through a bad place in
the forest. I bought those knuckles many
years ago in Norway. I guess I gave the
knuckles' to Herman at home. I never hit
anybody with those knuckles. Herman was
never in trouble at j home. I first saw that
knife at home. Herman used It to cut sausage
in his room. His father was a butcher. That
knife hangs in our room. Herman uses it now
to cut sausage. I had a knife much larger
and sharper-, on both sides than that knife.
I lost it In the old country. I lost the blade,
but the handle and sheath are still in the old
country. I have a revolver in my room. I
brought it to this country with me. When
I got here my uncle told me I would have to
cut it down. Herman lived in town at home.
I lived In town in the winter and in the
country in the summer. I lived one-half mile
from town. Herman and I did not go to
school together. Stavanger is a town of 35,
000 population. My uncle is Burt H. Lietjen.
He Is a bay freighter at 44 East street and
he lives at 247S Market street. The only per
sons here who knew me in the old country
are my uncle and aunt.
I left. there. on March 9. I went to 318 Laguna
street.' I have : been: at 1 318 Laguna Btreet two
months on - the 9th of next . month. â¢. Last Sat
urday night I ' left , the, place where I" work
a little after 6 -o'clock.- 1 1 have worked at that
shop for. eix or seven -weeks. Anton Frlend
ler owns 'the shop./ The' shop Is at'162 Ninth
street. â¢ From the â¢ shop we went over to the
saloon Â¦ across Â¦ the street. t " Smith and the man
who works with me in the shop were with me.
Smith came from work and was standing there
.waiting-, for. me. He was standing near- the
corner at the saloon: waiting for me. ' Smith
and the other man and I were at the saloon.
I- do-not, know the name of the other, man.
We stayed in the saloon until about Â¦ 9:30
o'clock. It was Â¦ between 9 and 10 o'clock. 1 1
think it was 9:30 o'clock. We went into the
saloon close on to 7 o'clock. We stayed in 'the
saloon more than two hours. . There was one
other man there, but I don't know him. "He
was talking: to the saloon-keeper. I don't know
the saloon-keeper's name. From the saloon we
went to the drug, store on Ninth street. We
went to the drug- store because Smith wanted
to get' a box of salve *o rub on his arm for
rheumatism. I. don't .know that Smith . has
rheumatism, but he rubs the salve on any place
or joint that is stiff. From the drug store we
went home. We " got home somewhere around
10 o'clock. We went home by way of Ninth
street, Market street, Oak - street and to the
left on Laguna street. I did not meet any
body I knew on the way home. We did not
stop in any saloon on the way home.
We did not meet anybody in the house when
we got home. . I have learned what English I
