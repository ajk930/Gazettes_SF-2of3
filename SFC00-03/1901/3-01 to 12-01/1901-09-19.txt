f% ANTON, Ohio, Sept. 18. â Throughout the afternoon the human tide pressed steadily forward to
+J the bier. Four abreast in double line, without a moment's halt the people hurried by the casket and
then, with tear-stained faces, passed out of the darkened chamber into the bright sunlight. In the line
were those representing all stations in life, all ages, all conditions. At one moment an pld man, bent
and witJiered, who had known "Mother" McKinley, tottered up to gaze upon the silent features. He
was followed by a man of middle age, who had gone to school with McKinley. Over on one side was
the Knight Templar who had marched beside McKinley in parades. All who came had some recol
lection of personal relation with the man lying there cold in death. Fathers brought their children and
held them over the bier for a fleeting glance at the upturned face. 'A sleeping baby zvas aroused by its*
mother for a sight its little mind could not comprehend. Toilers came from the factories qnd dinner
pails in hand, trooped by the bier of him whom they called their benefactor and their friend. A great
flood of emotion was welling up in the Jiearts of these sojrowing people. y

SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER \19, 1901.
The San Francisco Call.At the meeting of the Cabinet yesterday
President Roosevelt amplified the an
nouncement which he made on taking the
oath by declaring specifically that the pol
icies which were outlined in Mr. McKin
ley's Buffalo speech were to be carried
out. In the language of the speech these
are. "Policies of good will and friendly
trade relations."
Policies Number Four.
They are four in number. Foremost Mr.
McKinley placed the policy of entering
Into reciprocity treaties with other na
tions and making concessions from the
high tariff rates of the Dingley law on
goods imported from foreign countries In
return for reciprocal concessions on goods
imported into these countries from the
Vnited States.
"If perchance," said he, "some of our
tariffs are no longer needed for revenue
or to encourage or protect our industries
at home, Â¦why should they not be em
ployed to extend and promote our mar
ked abroad?"
The eecond policy for which Mr. Mc-
Kinley declared in this last speech of his
life was for the development of the mer
chant marine of the United States â for
more ships under the American flag, built
and manned and owned by Americans.
The third policy referred to in the Buf
falo speech was the construction of the
isthmian canal, and the fourth was the
laying of a Pacific cable. To these four
"policies of good will and friendly trade
relations" President Roosevelt specifically
pledged himself in his declaration to the
Cabinet yesterday. No public announce
ment has yet been made as to details or
methods to be pursued In carrying put
these policies, but the President's insist
ence that he shall be aided by the men
who were to have assisted Mr. McKinley
in the same work is accepted as an assur
ance that there will be no radical depart
ure from the methods which would have
been followed had Mr. McKinley survived.
Secretary Hay Stays.
Secretary of State Hay declared to-day
that it was his purpose to retain the
portfolio originally thanded him by Presi
dent McKinley. He said it is hia inten
tion to stay as long as he feels capable
of satisfactorily attending to the "Taff airs
of. the Department of State. There was
no time limit on the invitation of Mr.
Roosevelt, nor has Hay put any time
limit with respect to his service in
Roosevelt's Cabinet. Hay pointed out to
a man with whom he talked that his
views are entirely in accord with those
of .Xfee President. Hay understands that
Roosevelt is completely informed of the
negotiations. with Great Britain with re
spect to the construction of the isthmian
canal, and has thoroughly concurred in
the policy adopted by President McKln
ley. Hay feels that he can still be of
usefulness and that it would be most un
gracious for a member of the Cabinet
to resign . after the President's request.
In 'the new administration he will con
tinue without change the negotiations by
which the United States will be freed
from the embarrassing obligations im
posed 'upon it by the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty. â¢ . -
It is true that prior to his election as
Vice President, Roosevelt strongly op
posed the position against fortifying the
canal, but since he assumed that office
he has been frequently consulted respect
ing negotiations, and- It is understood
that' there is no difference between his
and Hay's view for a neutral waterway.
Other Questions Pending-.
There are other questions pending which
Hay will proceed to dispose of under the
policy adopted before McKinley's assas
sination. The most important is that re
lating to reciprocity. Special Reciprocity
Commissioner Kasson will probably re
sume his duties this fall. He will continue
the tentative negotiations initialed last
spring and will have several conventions
in shape for signature immediately after
the ratification of French, British and
Argentine treaties still before the Senate.
"Hay will direct the signature of the
treaty for the cession of the Danish West
Indies to the United States and the treaty
of friendship and navigation and com
merce with Spain, and will take steos for
a revision of the treaties existing between
the United States and China. Absolute
observance of the cardinal principles
enunciated by Hay in, his cable note of
July 1, 1900, with respect to China will
continue. - -'-â¢ ' S =â¢ -Â¦ :.;->'
THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE VIEW BODY
A\ question which -will shortly arise with
respect to China will be that relating to
Manchuria, and both Roosevelt and Hay
are in accord in the determination tofully
protect American interests in that region.
The controversies between Canada and
the United States will be amicably ar
ranged, it is hoped, as McKinley desired,
but while willing to make concessions In
some other matters neither Roosevelt nor
Hay is prepared to authorize the cession
of a single foot of Alaskan territory to
Great Britain.

/JEW YORK, Sept. ' io.â -The Press says: In one of the thousands of letters condemning the
iw New York Journal as the instigator of the assassination at Buffalo a reader has sent to the.
Press a cartoon cut from the New York Evening Journal of April i, iooi, entitled, "An Object
Lesson." The cartoon, perhaps, was the worst (if degrees may be calculated for such infamy) of
the malignant series to which attention has been called. Its reproduction would be impossible at
any time. It exhaled tKe breath of It warned William McKinley }o Jiave a care lest
he have to protect himself - zvith armor. V It held before his gaze the imbecile pictures of foreign
monarclis wlw Jived infedr\of bombs and dynamite. And in printed words the New York' Journal
told William McKinley to "Beware." . â¢ /
A clownish Uncle S,am was pictured sitting in a rocking-chair smoking* a cig^ar. Near the
chair there was a caricature of McKinley of the kind that, yellotv journal readers have had put be

i the sheet was the caption, "Uneasy Lies the Head, That Wears a Crozun."
Directly under this were four pictures representing four rulers of Europe, their faces- given
" the likeness of the idiot or Half -wit. Puppet crowns sat on their heads. The idiotic expression of the
faces was combined with an expression of fear. Under the first of the monarch' s caricatures zvere
these words in the guise of nezvspaper head lines :"The Czar living in terror in '', armor-plated

Why Casket We s Closed.
CANTON. Sept. IS.â Among those at the
courthouse to-day while the body of the
late President lay in statu was the funeral
director of Buffalo who embalmed tha
body and came on here to transfer the
duties to the local funeral director. He
had received a dispatch, from hi3 busi
ness partner at Buffalo ttaying that some
comment was being made concerning the
haste with which the casket was closed
owing to the condition o:: the embalming
He stated, however, that the condition of
the. remains after the autopsy made It Im
perative to properly perform the usual of
fices of embalming, and he asked In jus
tice to himself and his assistants, that
this fact be stated on his authority. Â»
Americans Assemble in Berlin.
BERLIN, Sept. 18.â The American col
ony met at the United States Embassy
at 3 o'clock this afternoon to express sym
pathy and condolence on the death of Mr.
McKinley. General Schwan and many
ladies were present. Secretary Jackson
made the opening speech, and William E.
Curtis read an address in which the late
President's greatness, goodness and
kindness were referred to. Mr. Curtis
Dictured him as the workingman's friend,
and said it was incredible that he should
meet his fate at the workingman's hand.
The speaker condemned America, s na-r
tional liberality toward degenerates who
seek to destroy society and kill kings.
R. Day and Judge Grant, was on the plat
form.
All about were the black symbols of
mourning. The approach of the train was
unheralaed. No whistle was blown, no
bell was rung. In absolute silence It
rolled into the station. Even the biack
hooded locomotive gave no sound. There
was no panting of the exhaust pipes. The
energy that brought it seemed to have
been absolutely expended. At the mere
sight of the train people who had been
waiting there for hours were greatly al
fected. Women sobbed and men wept. .
Arrival of the Train.
For a full minute after it had stopped
no one appeared. Judge Day and his com
mittee moved slowly down the platform
in front of the line of soldiers to the cata
falque car and waited. Suddenly Abner
McKinley, in deep black, his face drawn
and tense, appeared in the vestibule ot
the car next to that conveying the re
mains and a moment later Dr. Klxey ap
peared, half carrying a frail and broken
lorm. It was Mrs. McKinley, arrayed In
itie deepest mourning.
Beneath the heavy black veil she held
her handkerchief to her eyes and her
slight figure shook convulsively. Gently
she was lifted from the car and supported
by Dr. Rlxey and Abner McKinley waa
practically carried to a carriage in wait
ing at the east end of the station. The
dcor of the carriage was closed and Mrs.
McKinley was driven hurriedly to her
home on North Market street, which she
had left only two weeks ago, her distin
guished husband in the full vigor of man
hood. Colonel Bingham, the President's
aid, then gave directions for the removal
of the casket from the car. The coffin
was too large to be taken through the car
and a broad window at the side was un
screwed and removed. While this was
going on the floral pieces inside were
carefully lifted out and placed upon the
ground at the side of the track. -. ..
When all was ready the soldiers and
sailors who had accompanied the remains
all the way from Buffalo emerged rrom
the car and took- up their - places. -- Tho
soldiers trailed their arms at their sides
and the sailors had their drawn cutlasses.
Only the body-bearers were bareheaded
and unarmed. Meantime President Roose
velt, with his brother-in-law. Captain
Cowles of the navy, in full uniform, at
his side, had descended from the car
ahead of that occupied by Mrs. McKinley.
The members of the Cabinet, Secretary
tJortelyou, Governor Nash. Lieutenant
Governor Caldwell and Judge Marshall J.
Williams of the Supreme Court, represent
ing the three branches of the State gov
ernment of Ohio, followed.
Simple Flag on Casket.
The President was met by Judge Grant
of the reception committee and the official
party moved to the west of the station,
where they formed In line, with the Presi
dent at the head. All Â¦were uncovered
The casket was then lifted through the
window and taken upon the shoulders of
the body-bearers. Only the flag was on it
now. At sight of it tears came" unbidden
and flowed freely. The sad procession was
then formed. It was headed by Colonel
Bingham tn full uniform, a bow of crape
fct the hilt of his sheathed sword. Pol
lowing and Immediately preceding the
casket was the local committee, headed
by Judge Day. >..,Â¦-.â¢ â¢
.Then came the soldiers and sailors
Slowly they moved down the platform
to the turn at the western end of the
station, where the President and Cabinet
stood. As they reached the head of this
line a clear -drawn bugle call sounded a
requiem. Before. the President and Cabi
net and the Ohio officials the coffin was
then borne to the hearse. When it had
bcon placed inside xhe President and the
official party entered carriages. Mean
time Admiral Dewey, Lieutenant General
Miles and the other high officers of tKe
Â«rmr and aivr, who composed the guard
of honor, had moved around to the east
side of the station. They also entered
carriages and took their place in the
larger procession that was forming. All
were attired in the full uniform of their
ranks. ' . . .
The shrill notes of the bugle had given
the first sign to the waiting multitude
outside the station that the casket was
approaching. Instantly the long lines of
soldiers became rigid, standing at pre
sent arms. The black horses of the
Cleveland troop, immediately facing the
station, stood motionless, their riders
with eabers lowered. Slowly through the
entrance came the stalwart soldiers and
sailors with solemn tread, bearing aloft
tho flag-covered coffin of the man this
city loved so well. As it came Into view
a great sigh went up . from the dense
throng. After the -first glance many of
the men and women turned away to hide
the emotion ;. which they could not re
strain, .i Â¦
When the casket had been consigned to
the hearse three mounted troopers gave
the signal for the melancholy procession
to move. A moment later the sound of
"Nearer,. My God, . to Thee" floated
through the air, as the Grand Army
veterans . with their band swung into
line and took up the march toward the
Courthouse. Through Tenth street and
Into Cherry and Tuscarawas the line
moved between solid masses of people,
banked from curb to store front, â¢ crowd
ing the housetops and filling every win
dow. Turning into Market street, the
main thoroughfare of the city, the pro
cession moved under great curtains of
mourning, strung from building to build
ing across the street every , hundred feet.
Hush in tho Crowd.
A majestically solemn spectacle - was
presented as the procession neared the
public square In the center of the city.
Alter the Grand Army came the Cleve
land-troop in their brilliant uniforms of
Austrian hussars, with tall bearskin
shakos, topped by pompons of. white.
At the hilt of every sword streamed a
long band of crape and the tiny silk
guidon was topped with a long black
streamer.
Immediately ' following ' the 'mounted
troops came the hearse bearing Its flag
covered burden. This was the eight that
cent a hush along the dense long lines
of humanity stretching for I a mile away
to the Courthouse. Â¦ As the casket passed
every head was bowed and every face
evidenced the great personal grief which
had come upon the community. .
Immediately following the hearse came
the carriage of President Roosevelt, who
rode with his brother-in-law, Captain
Cowles, and Secretary Gage. After the
carriages of 'the other members of the
Cabinet and those who had been near
to the late .President In public life
marched the National Guard of Ohio. As
the head of the procession reached the
great square of the - city the military
ranks swung about, forming solid fronts
facing the approaching hearse. As it was
driven to the curb the bearers stepped
from the places alongside and again took
up their burden. The casket was raised
and borne up the wide stone steps lead
ing to the entrance of the Courthouse.
The strains of "Nearer, My God,, to
Thee," were still sounding as the flag
draped cofQn disappeared 1 within the
building. â¢
President Roosevelt alighted from his
carriage and took the . arm of Secretary
Gage. The other.' Cabinet officers joined
them at the curb and then two and two,
with uncovered heads, they moved in pro
cession up the steps into the. building-
After them came the other public men
who were on the train. Major General
Brooke, in the full ' uniform of his high
rank, marched at" the head of the repre
fentatlves of the army, which included
Major General Otis and Major , General
MacArthur. Among the conspicuous fig
ures of the naval service were Rear Ad
v".^ 1 ,,, CrowninBhield Rear Admiral
O'Neill, Rear Admiral. Kenty and Briga-
dence of Mrs. George D. Harter on Mar
ket street. A company of the Ohio militia,
guards the house. . During the afternoon
the President walked over to the McKin
ley residence to inquire for Mrs. McKin
ley. He was informed that she had stood
the trio from Washington bravely, but in
the opinion of the physician It would not
be advisable for her to attempt to attend
the services at the church to-morrow. ShÂ»
will, therefore, remain quietly at 't*CTÂ»
with Dr. Rixey. The other Cabinet oOT-*
eers and the generals and admirals com
prising the guard of honor are also at ,
private residences. President Roosevelt
and the official party will start on the re
turn journey to Washington at 7 o'clock
to-morrow nieht.
Secretary Cortelyou will return to
Washington with the President to-mor
row night to gather up the late Presi
dent's personal effects and will return
later to Canton to aid Mr3. McKinley to

day while the people were assembling
there to view the remains. Some one ac
cused an Italian, who afterward grave his
name as Carmlns Devlatro, of saying he
would kill President Roosevelt. The man.
who could speak hardly a word of Eng
lish, became frightened and answered
"yes" and "no" at random to the ques
tions that were volleyed at him, invarla-'j
b!y giving the wrong answer, and in a"?
moment a great crowd had surrounded
him and the cry of "Lynch him!" was
raised. Major Marquis with a. company of
Ohio militia formed a hollow square and
rescued the man, who was taken to police
headquarters for his own protection. The

of Hearst's Journal was shown yesterday
in the action taken In the

of the New York Stock Exchange. On all
sides Heart's yellow sheets are held to
have been the chief agent in instigating
the assassination of the President and
there is a wholesome determination that
hereafter Hearst's publications shall be
rlad only by those who espouse the cause
OÂ£ In?he C Produce Exchange a petition was
circulated asking that the Journal be ex

Â«i "natures of all the members on the
floor In the Cotton Exchange it was an
nounced that the Journal was long ago
excluded from- the flies and that it will
never receive any recognition. - The mem
bers of the Stock Exchange began work
for the exclusion of Hearst's newspaper
and a formal petition, if necessary, will
be handed to the governing committee.
The New York Board of Fire Underwrit

With the notes of "Nearer, My God, to
Thee" following them, faintly through the
doorway, the body-bearers bore tho coffin
into the rotunda of the courthouse a little
before 1 o'clock. The walls and ceilings
were hung with dark crape, it being gath
erad into folds nt either corner of the ro
tunda, A single chandelier gave addi
tional light to the Â«im rays that passed
through the doorway. Beneath the clus
ter of electric lights stood the catafalque
upon Â¦which the casket was to rest.
Moving elowly the bearers placed the
coffin on its support. Then they swung
slowly around so that they faced to the
east. The silk banner lying over the
casket was drawn back, the wreaths
which rested upon its head were removed
and the coffin lid was t2fcen off. Word
was finally passed to President Roosevelt
and, followed by his Cabinet, he stepped
into the hall. He glanced down as he
reached the casket, halted for the space
of a breath and went on. The members
of the Cabinet lollowed him, one by one.
The President passed out to his carriage,
which bore him at once to the residence
of Mrs. Elizabeth Harter, where he â¢will
remain during his stay in Canton The
Cabinet officials, most of whom will also
remain at Mrs. Harter's home,' followed
immediately after. >>*â¢ â¢
After the President had gone the officers
of the army and navy, headed by Gen
eral Miles and General Brooke, who
walked together, passed out and entered
their carriages. When everything was
ready for. the public to enter Joseph Sax
ton, uncle of Mrs. McKinley, an aged
man, bowed . deeply with the weight of
years, entered! from the east . hall and
walked up to the casket. He stood for
of- signatures. Some years ago Hearst
was requested to resign from that club.
The president of the Institution sent the
request by registered letter to Hearst in
New York,- but the latter made no reply.
Leading citizens who are identified with
prominent social clubs hold that if posi
tive expression of opinion is not given
the silence or inaction will be construed
as a passive tolerance of the teachings
of anarchy. Measures for the exclusion
of the -yellow Journals are advocated for
the purpose of. giving expression to the
American sentiment of abhorrence for
the gospel of anarchy. Club men of their
own motion and suggestion have elected
to adopt this form of rebuking the yel
low press.

war,'l-he v? eaid,-- i l'and I -Just ''want to lay

a,reminder of the time I saw him last:"
"Take it in,"; said the sentry, and the
veteran hobbled into the hall. When he
got inside he. had more trouble and was
compelled to explain. his errand several
times. Finally the line passing the cof
fin .was stopped. long enough to allow tfcc
old man to step to its side tor a glance
into the coffin, and to lay his tiny flag on
its glass front. Then he turned back with
the crowd, hugging the now sanctified flag
tightly beneath his coat.
Tribute of Schoolgirls.
At one time a group of schoolgirls ap
proached the casket. There were six of
them and they, came three abreast. One
of the forward row leaned over for a Iook
and, gently disengaging rrom the bosom
of her dress a scarlet geranium, laid it
gently on the top of the wreaths that
were resting there. The others followed
her example, and although the sentries
had orders to permit nobody to place any
thing upon the coffin or to touch the
floral offerings that were already there,
the little tributes of the girls were al
lowed to remain, and they were still on
the top of the coffin when it was carried
through the door on its way to McKin
ley's cottage on North Market street. All
through the afternoon the crowd passe-1
the catafalque,' approximately at the rate
of 100 a minute, -making in the five hours
in which the body lay in state a total of
30,000 people, practically a number equal
to the actual population of Canton.
When the doors were closed at 6 o'clock
the line, four abreastr stretched fully one
mile, from the Courthouse, and people
were coming from the side streets to take
their places in line.

As the people hurried by the bier they

people turned j away regretful that thay
had not retained in their minds that"pic
ture of manly vigor which they knew so
well. Many of his nearest friends re
frained from looking upon the face, pre
ferring to preserve the memory of him as
in life.
Late in the afternoon an aged man
leaning upon two crutches, which he
managed with difficulty, appeared at the
door through which the people were mak
ing their exit. He asked the sentry to
allow 'him to enter, and when the sol
dier refused, saying that he had received
orders to allow nobody through that
door, the old man stood back, the picture
of woe. In a short time he again asked
the young sentry In pleading tones to al
low-him entrance through the doorway,
saying that in his feeble condition he was
not able to stand in line, which at that
time was extending fully a mile from the
entrance.

AGITATION IN THE LEADING CLUBS TO EXCLUDE
YELLOW ANARCHISTIC PRESS FROM READING-ROOMS
nHICAGO. Sept. IS.â Magistrate Prin
diville to-day decided to allow
Emma Goldman, the anarchist, her
freedom until the case comes up for
y hearing, under bonds of $20,000. Her
attorneys said they had secured
$15,000, and immediately left the
courtroom to seek the additional money
necessary. Meanwhile Miss Goldman was
led back to the women's annex at . the
Harrison-street station. She was visibly
disappointed at the amount of bond re
quired.
"I guess they thought they would make
the bond so big I could not furnish it,"
she said, "but I have friends the police
know nothing about, and I'll be out of
here by night."
The hearing of Miss Goldman's case on
the charge of "conspiracy to murder
President McKinley" was spt for to-mor
row. Her counsel, however, learning that
there would be no session of the court to
morrow because of the President's fu
neral, decided at a conference to take the
matter before a Magistrate to-day. The
matter of Mis3 - Goldman's guilt or in
nocence of the charge against her was not
mentioned, as Judge .Prindiville had de
cided to follow the example of Judge
Chetlain, who has the cases of the other
anarchists before him. â¢ Â¦
Mi3s Goldman wa3 exceedingly cheerful
when shs was brought into court by
Chief Matron. Keegan, and chatted vi
vaciously with her attorneys, Messrs. Sal
tiel, Geeting and Brown. . .
Mr. Geetmg, for Miss Goldman, ad
dressed the court first. He said that
while the defense was willing to allow
the police every opportunity to secure
evidence against Miss Goldman, -as well
as the other anarchists, he was confident
that Miss Goldman wag entitled -under
the law to "freedom, under bonds.
"I can assure this court," said the law
yer,' "that my client, if under no bond
at all other than her word, .would appear
before this court whenever desired.
, John E. Owens, representing the city
prosecutor, advanced no objection to ban
being allowed, but pleaded that because
of the importance of the case the bond
be made'as heavy as possible, in accord-
ance with the Illinois statutes. Miss Gold
man has not yet furnisied the bend.

"William McKinley was the choice
of the people of the United States
yfor President and the country is en
titled to have his policies carried
out as nearly as possible on Iine3
which would have been followed if "he
had lived."
This is the idea which President Roose
velt has had continually in mind ever
since Mr. McKinley's death. It prompted
his declaration on taking the oath that
the policies of the late President were to
be carried out. His first step was to in
sist upon each one of the late President's
advisers remaining in office. This insist
ence was so strong that no one of the
men who had aided - Mr. McKinley in
formulating his policies felt at liberty to
refuse to aid Mr. Roosevelt in carrying
them out. He also urged Secretary. Cor
telyou to remain in office, and It can Â¦ be
announced that Mr. Cortelyou will re
main and will give the new President the
benefit of his intimate knowledge of the
intentions of Mr. McKinley not only as to
broad policies but also as to appointment
to office, for in this respect, too, the inten
tions of the late President are to be car
ried out and promises that had been made
are to be fulfilled. " .. '

In none of the official reports so far
made does It appear that the secret ser
vice men took any part in the arrest,
though they demanded- that the prisoner
be turned over to them after he had been
disarmed. From photographs which have
been placed in the President's handÂ» the
secret service men appear more as mem
bers of the receiving party or as specta
tors than as officers on duty looking out
for dangers that threatened the life of
McKinley. t
President Roosevelt will Investigate the
bureau to determine whether the men
there employed are experienced detec
tives. Â¦ If the men are merely placeholders
the President will give the bureau a se
vere shaking up.
It appears from reports made to the
President that the secret service men who
were with McKinley were not men with
such experience as to be entrusted with
such duties. They were not detectives
acquainted with criminal methods, nor
were they alert in their duty as guards to
the President. They did not even accom
plish the arrest of the assassin, as ap
pears from the report of Captain. Wisser
of the Seventy-third Coast Artillery,
whose men weie on duty and disarmed
Czolgosz after the negro Parker had
struck him down.
CHICAGO, Sept. 18.â One of the first

VETERANS ORGANIZE TO
STAMP OUT ANARCHY
Loyal Â«-Iieague â¢-Â¦ of \ Horth. America
Comes " Into Existence in -
TACOMA, Sept. 18.â The Loyal League
of North America has been organized
here by Grand Army men to oppose an
archy throughout this continent. It pro
poses to' organize- local branches every
where and,- through them, to inculcate
love of American Institutions and insist
upon their -absolute protection. The pa
rent organization- to-day â¢ adopted a dec
laration of "principles which specifies its
object as follows:
"Walsh was to-day, sentenced to the Coun
ty Jail for three months for saying he
was glad President McKinley had been
killed.
"The hopeful view was taken, and quite
naturally it could be so explained. It
is easy to be wise after the event and to
say that in this respect the surgeons
were in error. Err they certainly did. as
the result shows, but to err in such a
way argues no incapacity or avoidable
Jack of judgment. It simply, we repeat.
Illustrates the fact that the medical man
is not a i>erfect being.
"Gangrene probably was established
two or three days before the fatal issue
followed, but it could hardly have oc
curred very early without giving rise to
more disquieting phenomena than aug
mentation of the pulse and respiration,
which, as we have said before, might
weJI have been due to some comparative
5jT unimportant disturbance. To the
yfround of the kidney we attribute little
importance further than arises from the
fact that it made one more traumatic
surface to become gangrenous. There Is
said to have been a trifling degree of
homatura of brief duration, but not
enough to indicate a very serious renal
"The case of the profoundly lamented
President may be set down as unique in
pome of its features, not so much, per-
J-aps, as regards the actual traumatism
inflicted by the assassin's bullet, as with
regard to the deferred appearance of tlie
gangrenous process that blotted out his
fair prospects of recovery." â¢
Doctors "Were in Error.
"The operation having been finished
without seriously taxing the distin
guished patient's vital powers, there fol
lowed at least five days of freedom from
serious symptoms. This we say with full
appreciation of the fact that the record
of the pulse and respiration teemed omi
nous, for the high rate might have been
due to any one of a number of conditions
not in themselves of grave importance.
"Without delay he was taken to a well
equipped hospital and attended by sur
geons of world wide reputation and vast
experience. The operation itself was per
formed by an exceedingly capable gyne
cologist, who was assisted by equally
capable surgeons. It is perfectly certain
that there was no technical fault in the
operation and it may be said with equal
positiveness that it would have verged
on madness to prolong the search for the
bullet after it had been acsertained that
it had not inflicted any very grave in
jury beyond that of the stomachâascer
tained, that is to say, within the limita
tions of warrantable efforts.
Operation Well Done.
"At the time of his assassination Presi
dent McKinley probably was in better
physical condition than most men of his
'age who lead a sedentary life. So far
as is known he Â¦was free from, all organic
disease, though his vitality may have
been somewhat impaired by the fearful
mental strain to which the duties of his
oSice and its responsibilities and anxie
ties had long subjected him. He was
suddenly cut down by a cruel wound,
but he bore it bravely, and there was
little of the condition known as shock.
This freedom from shock was correctly
interpreted as showing that no consider
able internal hemorrhage was going on.

coming edition of the New York
Medical Journal will discuss the
case of the late President McKin
ley In a. lengrthy article. It will
"It Is a melancholy consolation
to know that the fatal termination of
President McKinley's case was not in
the slightest degree due to any omission
to gfvÂ© him the full benefit of all the
present resources of our art, and there
is nothing: humiliating' in the fact that
the favorable prognosis which for five or
six days seemed justified should have
finally proved fallacious. It is expected
that an official report of the case will be
given to the profession in the course of
a short time. Pending the issue of the
report let us briefly review the case.

Elgrht lronmolders went to -work yester
day morning at the Joshua Hendy Ma
chine Shops and six at the Vulcan Iron
Works. The managers claim they are all
Â¦union men, former employes in the shops
to which they return. The defection of
*this number of molders. following the
* break two weeks ago in which twenty-one
Â¦molders returned to the Union Iron
Works, gives the managers much encour
agement. But the strike leaders say the
effect is not marked, as the shops can
use but few molders so long as the ma
chinists stay out.
. Twelve more men went to work yester
day at the Union Iron Works. They are
distributed among the trades. A few are
machinists, but presumably they are not
' union men.

- After thorongh in ventilation, and
in accordance -with the. foregoing
statement of facts, your committee
wqnld recommend that -volunteers
tic sent to Port Costa to preserver the
peace that J the frraln' may be han
dled, and Â«ngsent that subscription

penses of the men so employed.
Unless" such action be taken it is our
opinion that the crops cannot ba handled

In our opinion the difference* be
tween the Employer* 1 Association
and the strikers) are Irreconcilable,
anil the demands of.the Htrlkern are
mo unreasonable that they- cannot
and will not be acceded to. .
A. large number of men who desire to work
may find permanent employment at Port Costa
at good wages and we recommend the farmers
throughout the State to select and send, suit
able men there for. that puroose. -
dissatisfaction with the wages or employement,
but they were restrained by the strike leaders
in San Francisco. They claimed that the
labor unions of San Francisco had helped them
In their successful strike In July for higher
wages and shorter hours. They requested this
committee to visit the leaders of the Water
Front Federation at San Francisco and ascer
tain If something: could not be done to release
them from the present strike. We also visited
the warehousemen and grain handlers of Port
Coeta and found they had about 350 men at
workâ abcat one-half the usual number so em
ployed at this season of the year unloading
cars and barges and loading ships.
These men are boarded and lodged at the
warehouses, on barges and In temporary struc
tures. They are working under protection of
Deputy SheriffÂ»-of Contra Costa County. We
ascertained that there were no men then at
work -who are boarded and lodged at any of
the hotels, and that the assaults that have
been committed are preventing: their belns so
entertalr.ed or their going: out on the street
and mingling with the citizens of, the town.
We are also Informed that the hotels refuse to
accommodate non-union laborers, but are en
tertaining men who are out on strike.
Violence and intimidation have seriously in
terfered with obtaining help necessary to
handle the usual amount of grain that should
be handled at this time of the year, and the
temporary accommodations for men employed
are said to be full.
.The business of handling this season's crop
is in a badly congested state.
We interviewed Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa
County, who stated that with proper assistance
from the Board of Supervisors he could handle
the situation and maintain absolute order, but
that up to the present time such assistance
has not been granted him; that until euch as
sistance Is given him the present state of af
fairs must continue. He assured your commit
tee that he would deputize any number of
reputable citizens of the State who might be
cent there to preserve law and order and move
the crops. Unless men are sent the necessary
portion of the crop cannot be handled In time
to prevent serious loss.
Tour committee then visited San Francisco
and at the request of the Port Costa strikers
called on Mr. Furuseth, strike manager of the
"Water Front Federation. Wo stated to him
that we had Interviewed the strikers at Port
Costa and that they were ready to go to work
provided his consent could be obtained. We
explained to him thÂ« unprotected condition of
the crops throughout the State and the fact
that they must be moved at once. We told
him that the farmers would be glad to have the
union men handle their crops If they would, but
that unless they did the rarmers themselves
would be compelled to do the work to prevent
serious loes. Mr. Furuseth said that he would
not consent to that, that he would release no
one. He advised us to call on the executive
committee of the Employers' Association of
San Francisco and get that body to accede to
the demands of the striking teamsters of that
City. . . i
We then visited some members of the execu
tive committeÂ« of the Employers' Association
and were eiven a full account of the causes
leading to the organization of that body and the
work It was doing. We believe the position
taken and maintained by that organization to
be reasonable and Justifiable.
We herewith submit and append to this re
pott a copy of the declaration of principles of
the Employers' Association, and also a copy of
an article of agreement which the strikers de
manded the business men of San Francisco to
sljm. They are' submitted for your considera
tion and comparison: The presentation and
demand for the signing of such articles of
agreement is one of the causes for the existing
labor troubles.

Pacific Mail Dock he tumbled into the
bay. Policeman Mackey saved him from
drowning, hauled him ashore and started
with him in the patrol wagon for the
Harbor Hospital. When passing the Sail
ors' Home, Meyers hailed a crowd of
sailors and made a leap for liberty over
Mackey's head. Mackey caught the sailor
on his shoulder, and in spite of the efforts
of Meyers' friends, held the prisoner until
police reinforcements arrived. John La
Torres of the Coal Teamsters' Union
roundly abused the officers for arresting
Meyers. He was arrested for disturbing
the peace. Meyers and La Torres were
both released on bail.
The bride was attended by her sister,
Miss Etta Davies, as. maid of honor, and
the groom had for his best man Havelock

William Cole and Herman Nelson, union
sailors, and when taken to the police sta
tion they were identified by Edar and
booked on a charge of robbery. When
searched Cole had a policeman's club m
his pessession. The four defendants ap
peared in Judge Fritz's court yesterday

raigned and the cases were continued
till September 20.
While Edar was In the corridor out-
Eide the courtroom G.us. Holmgren, a

temptuosly displayed before his eyes two
53 gold pieces. Edar at once recognized
him as one of the robbers and so notified
Policemen Lake and Murphy, who placed
Holmgren under arrest. They took him
before Captain Seymour, and when he
was asked what his business was he said
he was a. picket on the water front for
the Seamen's Union. The captain in
structed the officers to take him to the

of robbery.
John Edar, ship's carpenter on the

The warrant charges them with having
opened a letter addressed to
John Moore, a- shingle weaver, at Ballard.
For convenience Moore had his mail ad
dressed to Summers' office, and when the
letter arrived, it is said. Summers receipt
ed for it, opened It and abstracted $10.
When the Summers came to Seattle a
year ago from Butte, Mont., they were
without money. They at once began mak
ing the acquaintance of the Catholics of
the city, with lhe result that they were
soon employed on the Catholic Progress.
It is said they abused the confidence of
Mr> Bookmyer to such an extent that he
was compelled to force them to leave his
employ. For the past four months Sum
mers has had an office In the New York
block and was engaged in practicing law.
It is positively known that they went to
San Francisco when they left here. They
were in Portland, however, on the 10th
inst., for they induced a Mr. Hess to cash
a draft,, which was sent to the National
Bank of Commerce here for collection. It'
was drawn on the Catholic Progress and
was indorsed by Mrs. Summers, but, of
course, Mr. Bookmyer pronounced it
fraudulent and it was returned by the
bank. . Since the Postofflce Department
has become interested in their arrest it is
believed they will soon be apprehended.
Mrs. Summers Is said to be very pre
possessing ana of a quick, nervous tem
perament, well equipped for obtaining
money on a sympathetic basis.
The preponderance of these plans were
calculated to follow the advice given by
David Harum in a horse trade: "Do the
other fellow before he does you." As one
result of this system United States Dis
trict Attorney Gay to-day issued a war
rant for their arrest.
SEATTLE. Sept. 18.â C. Edwin Sum
mers, lawy en arrived in Seattle one year
ago. He departed about one month ago.
His stay was short but meteoric. On his
arrival he had little besides a trunk full
of good clothing and a wife gifted with a
pleasing appearance and an energetic de
votion to her husband's plans.
Special Dispatch to -The Call.
"A woman came to me yesterday with
a pitiable story of the mistreatment of
her husband by the strikers. He is a
porter and he went out with his union.
After a while he could endure no longer
to see his family starving: and he Â¦went
to work again for his former employer.
The strikers lay in wait for him and beat
him most cruelly. He is now nearly re
covered and is anxious to get to work,
but mortal fear assails him whenever he
grets twenty feet from his own door. His
wife intended to go to the- newspapers
and tell their story, but she was given
to understand that if she did or if her
husband went back to work the strik
ers will retaliate upon the whole family.
Site came down at once and begged of
me not to give her name to the report
ers."
"lhe dissatisfied strikers are being kept
in line not merely by the fear of attacKs
and brutal beating's. They are given to
understand that they will be killed if
they do not stand by the union. Fear
of that is what keeps many from going
back to worlr.
'â¢The record of the hospitals and City
Prison show the situation to be most out
rageous. And yet I do not believe that
more than one assault in ten gets into
the papers or is recorded at the Jail or
hospitals. A non-union man is attacked
and beaten and left half dead. Possibly
he is able to go home, or friends help
him heme. His injuries are dressed by
nis wife or if more serious bv his physi
cian, and nothing: is ever known to "thÂ«s
public of the attack.
Manager George Renner of the Dray
men's Association says that if violence
continues to increase he does not doubt
a vigilance committee will be formed to
attempt to secure the enforcement of the
law.
The eve of the nation's day of mourn
ing brought few developments in the
strike situation. To-day there will be
an almost entire cessation of business in
the wholesale district and on the water
front, and it is not expected that the con
troversy will assume any new phases
whatever.

a lucky day for this youn?r man wiaen hl3

would have been the result had he con-

precious time with other remedies, no man
can tell. But lt is almost certain that it
would have ended In incurable Eright's
disease of the kidneys, which sooner or
later would have proved fatal.
Peruna is a sure cure for Incipient
Bright's disease of the kidneys. Taken
In the early stages of this disease, It
cures permanently. Bright's disease al-
ways begins with catarrh of the kidneys.
Peruna cures catarrh, wherever located.

John Herziger, son of Alderman Her-
zlgrer of Neenah. Wis.. and vice president
of the Neenah Young Men's Club, writes
in a recent letter to The Peruna Medicine
Co. of Columbus, Ohio, the following:
"After suffering for two years with
kidney trouble I received relief and a
cura from using your wonderful med-
icine, Peruna.
"For months I was unable to work
on account of a severe pain in my
back, and when I was able to do any-
thing I was in pain and distressed
most of the time.
I "Hearing so much of the good re-
sults people had obtained through the
use of Peruna I determined to give it
a trial, and it was a lucky day for me
when I did so.. I am well now and it
only took a few bottles of Peruna.'.' â
John . Herziger, 307 Commercial
street, Neenah, Wis.
Two years suffering with catarrh of the
kidneys, unable to work on account of the
severe pain; could find r>/> relief from
medicine; gave Peruna a trial and' was
promptly curedâ such was the experience
of John Herziger of Wisconsin.

One of the curious things about the assassination
of the President is a number of persons cropping- up
in all parts of the country who had heard reports of
a conspiracy to commit the crime but who never
thought of saying anything about it.
It;is not often that outsiders say â¢ better things
about us' than we say about ourselves, but sometimes
they do. For example, the Atlanta . Constitution
says: "The Merchants' . Association of San Fran
cisco has broken the power of the evil and unclean
gangs and placed the city on a healthy foundation."
It will be" perceived that while the report is correct
as to the intent, it is rather premature as to the ac
complishment. Â¦ â¢ ..
The old saying it is an ill wind that blows good to
nobody appears to be holding true even in the case
of the assassination of the President, for ever since
the commission of the crime the number of people
visiting the Temple of 'Music at the^Buffalo expo
sition out of curiosity has given the show something
in the nature of a boom. . . .
Mr. Bryan has at last admitted that he sometimes
makes mistakes. In a recent number of the Com
moner he admits receiving a book entitled, "Ellen,
or the Whisperings of an Old Pine," and apologizes
for having in a previous number made the word
"pine" read "pipe." It is hardly necessary to add
that he attributes the wrong to a typographical error.
On the other hand the objectors declare that to ac
cept a gift of the kind would be to make the Metro
politan a receiver of stolen goods, knowing them to
have been stolen. The Springfield Republican urges
a further objection in the statement: "To a nice
conscience these treasures of the consummate skill
of great Chinese artists for famous centuries will al
ways remain tainted not . with the stain of pillage
alone, but with the disgrace and blood of - innocent
; beings slain."
The officials of the museum are reported to be
quite sure that an art museum can properly be made
the custodian of lost, provided the loot have an ar
tistic value, and provided further that there be a way
of eliminating the word loot from consideration of
the problem. Thus the curator is quoted as saying:
"The collection cannot now be called loot, since it
has been put up at auction. It has had a commercial
experience." Another defender of the rightfulness
of accepting the donation says that art collections
made in that way are not novelties. It recalls the
fact that Napoleon looted the galleries and the
churches of nearly all Europe for the purpose of en
riching the great collections at the Louvre; that the
British Museum contains certain marbles of . the
Parthenon which Elgin bought from the Turks, who
looted. them from Athens; and, finally, many of the
great monumental works of art in Rome were looted
from subject cities. * '
.There is no question, of legality involved in the
issue. It is conceded that the gentleman who offers
the articles to the museum has a legal right to them.
He did not himself loot them. He purchased them at
auction in China from persons who had obtained them
by the simple process of taking them. The collection
is said to be large enough to fill several railway cars
and includes many valuable porcelains, bronzes,
wood carvings, ivories, paintings and silks. That
they would constitute an important exhibit in any
collection of oriental art is not denied. The one ob
jectionable feature about them is that they would
be looked upon by some persons as an exhibit of loot
rather than as a exhibit of art.
The cause of the discussion is that the articles con
tained in the gift are parts of the spoil that was ob
tained in the looting of Chinaâ that is to say, the
gift is virtually made-up of stolen property, and the
debate turns upon the moral right of the museum to
accept gifts of that kind.
AS a means of relieving their minds from the
perplexities of the problem of organizing a
combination strong enough to assure a tri
umph for honesty in the approaching city election
the people of New York have undertaken a discus
sion of the relation of morals to art. It is not an
academic discussion merely, for it relates to a gift
which has been offered to the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in that city; r.or yet is it strictly a practical
question, for it is well known what the issue will
be. In feet, it is. just the kind of a question most
likely to give rise to spirited i'tcbate .without com
pelling aijy one to commit himself decidedly one
way or the other.
It is certainly a curious anomaly in our law that
while it. makes such careful provision for the protec
tion of mail carriers it ignores the dangers that sur
round the Presidency, and it is well nigh certain that
at the coming session of Congress some effort will
be made to provide by Federal law for the punish
ment of persons who assail the President and the
chief officers of the Government
The section in the Federal statute, which in this
connection is sufficiently interesting to be quoted in
full, reads thus: "Section 5472â Any person who
shall rob any carrier, agent or other person intrusted
with the mail, of such mail, or any part thereof, shall
be punishable by imprisonment at hard labor for not
less than five years and not more than ten years;
and if convicted a second time of a like offense, or if
in effecting such robbery the first time the robber
shall wound the person having custody of the mail,
or put his life in jeopardy by the use of dangerous
weapons, such offender shall be punishable by impris
onment at hard labor for the term of his natural life."
Despite the earnestness of those who favor drastic
laws upon the subject, the general tone of the discus
sion has been adverse to such measures. The people
are not yet willing to admit that the President of the
republic needs any other provision for his safety than
that which the law affords to every citizen. The dis
cussion, however, has brought to light a curious
anomaly in our statutes in that respect. The Bos
ton Transcript directs public attention to the fact
that under the New York law had the President sur
vived the . maximum penalty which could have been
inflicted upon the assassin would Â¦ have been ten
years' imprisonment, while under the Federal statutes
a similar assault upon a mail carrier would have been
punishable by imprisonment for life.
WHEN it was believed that the President
would recover from his wound and that the
assassin would therefore under the law of
New York escape the death penalty, there was a
good deal of discussion concerning the proper
method of dealing with persons who the
assassination of a President of the United States.
Some authorities declared in favor of drastic meas
ures. Ex-Attorney General Griggs, for example, is
quoted as having recommended the passage of an
act making an attempt upon the life of the President
or any of the hjgher officers of the Government a
capital offense, whether it succeed or not, and pro
viding punishment by imprisonment for life for any
person convicted of- being a member of an organi
zation which teaches the murder of public officials.
ART AND MORALS.
The day of poison in the mental food of this peo
ple is over. They are using tongs to cast the Exam
iner into the gutter, where the scavenger will find it
and carry it away to defile the garbage with which
it rides :n his cart and rests upon the dumps. Tol
erance for it and those who make it what it is is at
tn end. Patience with its gorilla lusts, baboon mal
ice and monkey-shines is exhausted, and nothing it
may do will sugar and shine it to a disguise that may
jerrr.it its entry again into decent company. -â *; ;
San Francisco is in sackcloth' and ashes. Grief for
the dead is in the lines of all good men's faces and
in the hearts of all good women. But mingled with
it is a shame that downcasts- every eye when it is
remembered that here Hearst journalism took root,
tried its 'prentice hand and spread hence like a pes
tilence. Here the mangy pup gnawed its first bone,
did its first snapping and snarling at private charac
ter, yip'ped its earliest ululations against law and or
der and grew to be a dog bad enough and big enough
to invade any fold at night, cut any throat with its
fangs, and seek the blood of the best: â¢ But San
Francisco is repenting of her . indifference to the
growth of this beast and will cleanse her hands of
further responsibility for its existence.
The era of such impudence is over. The light of
exposure broke too late to save the life of a President
who has fallen, the most distinguished human sacri
fice of all time, to the greed, malice and venom of a
school of journalism which, with the name of its
founder, will be cremated in the fires of patriotic
wrath. . .
The Press now keenly analyzes the effect of the
notoriety that Hearst sought and that Mr. Cleveland
refused to be used in promoting.
WILLIAM R. HEARST: I decline to permit my sor
row for the men who died on the Maine to be .perverted
Into an advertisement for the Xew York Journal.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
One man whom he attempted .to use as a bill
board struck back at him a blow with the impact of
a cannon-ball. Hearst chose the corpses of the ten
score men who died on the Maine as an advertise
ment and organized a. movement to collect money to
erect to them a New York Journal monument. As
his vice presidents in this attempt he even secured
such men as Levi P. Morton and William C. Whit
ney, or said he had. He then wrote to ex-President
Cleveland for consent to use his name as a Journal
vice president. The keen intelligence, courage and
manhood of Mr. Cleveland saw through the wretched
scheme, and he answered in this curt note, which
should be framed and set over the desk of every pub
lic man in the United States:
Every event that focused public interest was seized
upon by Hearst, not for legitimate newspaper use,
but for special advertising of himself. His hired liars
gave Ananias the right to a new trial by their fakes
and inventions. In this way he published faked in
terviews with the Pope, the Queen Regent of Spain
and Mrs. McKinley. These were absolute inven
tions. No such interviews were given. His hirelings
never reached the presence of Pope, Queen or Presi
dent's wife. But Hearst wanted a reputation for en
terprise that would advertise him, and so the inter
views were invented and published. His offenses of
that kind against truth, decency and good conscience
were legion, and the exposure of one only stimulated
the inventio\i of another. By simulating interest in
some public question he would induce public men of
reputation to appear in his papers over their own sig
nature, only to characterize them as his "commis
sioners," or members of his staff, and put them in the
humiliating position cf sandwich men, toting his yel
low advertisement. All such as were so used by him
feel now keenly that they were being used to give
respectability and quasi-indorsement to the riot, an
archy and murder taught in his noisome papers.
' I "Â»HÂ£ New York Press, whose editor was threat-
I ened by Hearst in an attempt to make that
*â¢ paper desist from its exposure of the crime
breeding course of Hearst's papers, has laid down a
rule for the extinction of such journalism as Hearst
has originated and practiced. The remedy is prop
erly stated to lie with the people, by ignoring the cul
prit and his papers and refusing to be used as sand
wich men to advertise both.
A LEGAL ANOMALY.
YELLOW ADVERTISING.
iB Headlining and introducing an editorial
I from the New York Journal in our edition
firf yesterday an error was made by
cnarging that its publication occurred on
September 1 3, while the President was dy
ing. This was a mistake, occurring by haste
arm inadvertence, and due to the fact that
the New York Journal editorial was repro
duced in the Commercial-Tribune of Cincin
nati on September 1 3. We desire to be just
even to the unjust. The editorial was pub
lished in the Journal a few weeks prior to the
assassination of the President and is re
garded by public opinion as one of the in
fluences leading to that event, and was not
concurrent with the accomplishment of the
purpose which it seemed to express.
A CORRECTION.
In lineage the dead President was the last of his line. He sleeps beside his dead.
His father and his mother and his children rest by .his side, and the leaves of autumn
strew the place of their repose. But the high example of his lofty life leaves a lineage
that death cannot destroy and its inspiration will be as immortal as the republic.
This is a day of significance. Its tears will be dried, its somber trappings and all
its pomp and circumstance of solemn pageantry will pass away, but history will linger
long and fondly upon the story of which it is the last chapter. -
Life at its best is brief. Men bear their burdens for a day only and: the load falls
and its carrier is not. But as compared to the longest life and all that it may achieve,
how very brief those years in which his greatest work was done, but how eternal its im
pression!
The history of that brief space, between March 4, 1897, and the moment that his
heart ceased to beat, covers more of human tragedy, of the sport and change of fortune,
the alternation of storm and sunshine, the uplifting of a people from want and idleness
to plenty and occupation, than passed before in the history of man. In that timelthe
shell of the past burst and a new world issued fullfledged; and he saw it; all, and -was 'it~3
conscious impulse. He impressed all people with some expression of his genius, which
they wear as their password to a better life. Far China salutes his ' memory, as the
Just Man, and those whom he delivered as the Man of Power. ; <
From his high place he ministered through 1 'wise administration to the materialities
of his countrymen, and was not only commander in chief of his country's army' and
navy, but of his country's commercial conquest of the world. When he first uttered the
great oath which obligates a President, chaos was upon industry and labor was on famine
rations. When from his death bed he looked his last upon the beautiful trees plenty was
bursting the storehouses and piled every table.
- Â¦Â¦-. - Â¦Â«._.-Â¦ | â¢ ....... â¢..-.,
TO-DAY the last rites are observed and the mortal presence of the dead President
passes from sight, through that narrow door that at last closes upon all human
ity. While standing on the dome of his career there passed before him a paro
rama of events *that stirred his country to the depths. For the second tinie he
heard the call to arms. ' When the first sounded it thrilled his boyish heart and nerved
him to spring from obscurity into history. The second time his own hand rang the
tocsin, and in response thousands left the furrow and the forge, like him emerging into
the trials and sufferings of the larger life and risk, to which the ineffable inspiration of
patriotism calls men and they come heedless of restraint. The survivors of the Civil War
heard the bugle call once more, and Union and Confederate soldier alike, forgetting their
battles and differences, saluted the old flag and marched side by. side to vindicate the
majesty of their country and its institutions. He saw the last embers of civil strife and
sectional hate smolder and die, and the vision" of a reunited people' become reality. He
saw the empire of Philip II die, swathed in all its sins, and its epitaph blazoned with all
its virtues. He saw the dream of that world-grasping monarch fade in the sunshine of
an awakened world and the proud estate of its Emperor probated to the republic.
He felt the thrill that was upon us as our regiments marched away and the pall that
fell upon our spirits as the helpless dead came back to their narrow homes.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
Bishop was always a busy man In his
diocese and numerous charitable organi-
The Rev. Henry Codman Potter was
born in Schenectady, N. T., in 1835, and
was educated for the priesthood in Phil
adelphia. His rise in the Episcopal
church was rapid and his ability so ap
parent that in 1887 he was consecrated
Bishop of the New York diocese, the
largest in the United States.
It seems more than lively that the fa
mous Bishop, Right Rev. Henry Codman
Potter, will be elected to the primacy of
the church. Bishop Potter is a descend
ant of a noted family of divines. Hte
father, Alonzo' Potter, was for twentyi
years Bishop of Pennsylvania.
;One of the most important matters to
be considered- at the convention is the
election of a primate for the Episcopal
church, of this country.'
i Delegates will journey here from all
points of the United States and special
trains will be run- by the various rail
road companies to accommodate them.
After the convention concludes its labors
si great many of the delegates will visit
the various points of interest throughout

SIXTY Bishops, some 600 delegates
and about 3000 visitors will arrive

SUMMARY.
Ruiz on Saul of Tarsus beat the others
away In the closing six furlong sprint,
and at odds of 3 to 1 was never headed.
Mike Strauss led Mike Rice out for the
second place, with Jim Hale, the favorite",
unplaced.
Foncon landed the fifth race at five fur
longs with Kitty Kelly. The mare opened
a 3 to 2 favorite, receding to 5 to 2. Fon
con took matters quietly to the stretch,
where he passed Nullah and Clarando,
getting in first by a length. Howson on
Gold Baron nabbed Clarando the last few
yards, finishing second. Nullah closed a
6 to 5 choice.
As Ransch had the leg up on Ringmas
ter and tlie company seemed common
place, the old stager was installed favor
ite for the mile and a furlong affair. He
raced out in the lead for a mile with
McFarlane, and then struck his colors.
"Chub" Russell sneaked along on the
outside with Kastalne the last sixteenth,
winning easily. Ashby on El Mido moved
thirteen minutes late and then took the
place. '
After besting the Burns & Waterhouse
entry, Elfonse, a head for the opening
sprint, Mamie Hildreth, piloted by Ruiz,
was disqualified, and the backers of
Rarjsch were made happy. Mamie Hil
dreth made the running, but when col
lared by Elfonse in the stretch, Ruiz, as
he always does, resorted to questionable
tactics and was rightfully set back. The
decision gave second money to Darlene
and the show to Pegalong.
Outclassing the other three starters In
the- six furlong purse run, Meehanus made
a runaway race of it. Rollick finished well
up, defeating Sir Dougal for third posi
tion.
The brown horse McKenna with Ward
behind him had first call in the pit when
odds were posted on the trot. Joe Selby,
driven by Nelson, beat him for the first
heat. This must have Â¦ been ' a' mistake.
He toyed with Selby in the next three.
Lucy G and Lady Granard appeared out
of their class.- While being warmed up
previous to the second heat Joe Selby
reared up, and falling- backward, gave
Driver Nelson a severe Jarring. The
horse's groom next took the reins and
was likewise treated. The veteran "Billy"
Donathon then got up in the sulky, fin
ishing the race.
A trotting event that pleased the old
timers and awakened remlnlscenses from
the time "of Brian Bora down to the birth
of the pnumatlc tired sulky and five run
ning recitals attracted another large
crowd to the Golden Gate race meeting
"yesterday at Oakland track. * Nothing of
a startling nature characterized the sport,
unless it was the partially successful at
tempt of Joe Selby. a starter In the 2:24
trot, to flatten out two of his drivers by
falling backward and rolling upon them.
Elfonse, Meehanus and McKenna. were
the successful favorites, and Ringmas
ter, Nullah and Jim Hale â¢ the disap
pointments. There will be no racing to
day.

From advices received in this city yes
terday it is definitely known that the ac
tion taken by General Chaffee in regard
to the two firms named was only a pre
paratory step, and that some very sensa
tional developments are sure to follow.
The island of Samar is looked upon as
the hotbed of the insurgents. A civil gov
ernment was established there Â¦ but was
found to be a failure owing to the law
less state of the island, and martial law
had. to be continued. â¢ !
The merchants "whose agents have been
expelled from the island of Samar com
prise two of the richest firms in Manila,
with branch offices in London. Though
they were known to Be aiding and abet
ting: the insurgents by buying hemp of
them and selling them rice and munitions
of war no. steps had been taken against
them in the past, the American Govern
ment being afraid that international, com
plications with England might follow.
Now that General Chaffee has ignored
the protests of the British Consul and
has indorsed the action of General
Hughes it is known that the officials^in
Manila will be rupported by the authori
ties in Washington in restraining mer
chants, whether German, English, Spaji
ish or any other rationality, from trading
with the insurgents or having any'com
munication with them.
The telegraphic news published yester
day announcing that General Hughes had
expelled the agents of Smith & Bell and
Warner & Barnes from the island of Sa
mar is followe-1 up by interesting news
received in this city.'

LONDON. Sept. IS.â An alarming situa

locked-out fishermen this afternoon at
tacked and wrecked and- set fire to the
new offices of the Owners* Federation,
â¢where the owners of the fishing: fleet were
holding a meeting. The owners escaped
and the fire was extinguished, but the
police were powerless to quell the riot.
A strike has been in progress among the
fishermen at Grimsby for several months.
Four hundred steam fishing boats are
Idle and thousands of fishermen and
their families have been suffering great
hardships. Food had to be sent to them
by sympathetic committees.

Walker was last seen talking with the
storekeeper about the supplies for the
next day. An hour afterward, on an
alarm given by the storekeeper, the ship
was searched and no trace of the steward
was found. He had been previously talk
ing about jumping overboard, and no
other explanation can be given for his
disappearance.
When it became evident that the stew
ard had taken his own life it was with
difficulty that the storekeeper could be
restrained from sharing- the 'same fate.
Doctors were called and the man was
given treatment for his mental trouble.
VANCOUVER. B. G. Sept 18.-T. W.
"Walker, chief steward of the steamship
Empress of India, which arrived hero
early this morning from the Orient, is
supposed to have committed suicide dur
ing: the night while the vessel was com
ing up from Victoria to this port. Walker
had been suffering from mental aberra
tion all the way across on this run. He
was much in company with Robert
Blythe, the storekeeper, who seems to
have been similarly afflicted and who has
taken Walker's disappearance much to
heart.

The United States army transport Grant
arrived from the Philippines yesterday.
She was a day behind her last run, but
on this occasion she was not "making
time," while last July she had to be here
in order that the Government might keep
faith with the volunteers who signed for
two years' service in â¢ the Philippines.
While running under "rush" orders the
Grant covered C542 knots in twenty-two
days four hours and two minutes, while
on this occasion it took her twenty-three
days lour hours and twenty-five minutes
to cover 6544 knots. A variation of only
two knots in such a run goes' to show
that Captain Bruguiere knows the cur
rents of the Pacific Ocean and also the
variations of the tides. Chief Engineer
LIndley says :he transport could easily
have reached San Francisco last Tuesday
evening- had he not been bound down to a
certain number of revolutions by the Gov

QJ* 'I'M Vf â¢ | v .
Pacific Mutual Liie taw Co.:
The Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. ha3 retired from the Industrial Insurance
Â¦ business, and, by a contract with the Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. of New Tork, the
has agreed to assume all the Pacific Company's outstanding Indus-
*trial Policies, with the consent of the holders thereof.
The Metropolitan is the largest Industrial Company in the country, being aa
large as all the other companies put together.
It has over $62,000,000 of assets,, over $3,000,000 of surplus; nearly 5% millions of
Industrial Policies in force for an insurance ax&mnting to nearly a thousand mil-
lions of dollars.
It paid over $S,000,000 In death claims last year and pays a claim on the aver-
age every seven minutes.
It is the most liberal, company In Its treatment of Policy Holders in the whole
country, or in the world. -"â¢.
For many years It has written more insurance annually than any other com-
pany ia the world. . . .>
In purely ordinary business, aside from the Industrial. It stood No. 4 last year,
being preceded only by the Ne-vr Tork Life, the Mutual and the Equitable.
The Industrial field forcesâ Superintendents, Assistant Superintendents and
Agentsâ of the Pacific have for the most part joined the Metropolitan. They will
call upon the Policy Holders and invite them to have their policies guaranteed
by the Metropolitan. The Metropolitan agrees to carry out in every respect the
policy contracts of the Pacific; so that the Pacific Industrial Policies will now
have 62 millions of assets behind them. New Policies will not be required. Tha
Pacific Policies will be stamped with a contract of assumption by the Metropolitan.

Duchess of Cornwall and York Journeyed
from Quebec to Montreal to-day and were
greeted with another affectionate demon
stration from the people of Canada. They
departed from Quebec at 9:30 o'clock in
the morning and the last sound that fell
upon their ears was a cheer from the peo
ple. They had spent the night aboard
the roval yacht Ophir ana came ashore
shortly after 9 o'clock. The sumptuous
special train provided especially for their
lonsr Journey to the Pacinc Coast was in
waiting and as soon as they were aboard
it went epeedlng down tbe north shore of
the St. Lawrence on the road to Montreal.
The royal special was preceded half
an hour by another special train, which
carried Lord Mlnto, Governor General;
Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Premier, and mem
bers of the Dominion Cabinet. The peo
ple came for miles to give a cheer or wave
a flag at the fleeting train. . "-
ThÂ«Â» welcome at Montreal, which .was
reached at 3 o'clock, was an ovation.
Thousands of visitors had crowded into
the city to reinforce the residents and
thev all seemed to be massed In the neigh
borhood of Place Vigor station and the
King Edward's Son Con
ducts Ceremonies in
Montreal.
Some one shouted from the tug before
the quarantine flag was hauled down,
"Jim, how is everything?" The ready an
swer was, "All rightâ both myself and
Filipino family." And General Smith has
a Filipino family with himâ five young,
oily-skinned native boy6, whom he has
brought back for a schooling. They are
sons of well-known men in the islands,
and under the custody of General Smith
were sent to this city. They will be edu
cated at Santa Clara College. By name
these boys are Jose Jamora, Francisco
Ramos, Hector Lurzuriaga. Jose de la
Rama and Trinitario Delgado. Two oth
ers there are of tho Torres family, and
Brings Filipino Family.
Captain Harry Curzon was the flrst to
grasp his old comrade's hand. "When we
left Negros I was the last of the regiment
to say good-by to him," said Curzon.
"You see, I w-is his adjutant." After that
came a deluge of handshaking and a
storm of good wishes from all but the la
dies, who were forced to wait until the
general came to them. This he did later
onâ after all tho business of customs in
spection had been passed. The committee
and friends filed up the gangplank, had
their handshake and then looked pleasant,
as the sun, whioh hitherto was burled in
fog, broke throuch its dim covering.
When the time had arrived for board
ing the Grant the Slocum slipped its nose
into the gangplank and blocked the way
of. the Markham.. There was nothing for
the committee to do then but scramble
ever the Slocum' s decks to the Grant,
which was done with much celerity and
dispatch. â¢ '
Handshakings and Helios.
clean bill of health. During, this wait it
was "Hello, Jim" and /'Hello, General,"
and-Â«H the other customary salutations.
Even Mayor Phelan talked over Â¦ the
water. He delivered himself of a brief
official welcome and got a wave . of the
hat and "How are you, Mayor?" from the
returning general.
DUKE HONORS
WAR VETERANS
The tug's Governor Markham and Gov- |
ernor Irwin were chartered by the com'
mittee and, well crowded, they steamed
out to the Grant, which lay off Alcatraz.
On the Markham were many -of the of
ficers of Smith's regiment and the ornate
Governor's staff. Mayor Phelan and a
few other celebrities were there. Mrs.
Smith, wife of the general; Mrs. Anna
Smith, his mother; his sister-in-law, Mrs.
FVank Smith, and his son Cyril, all went
out to met him. Seven months ago the
general's wife and son left him in Manila,
but his mother had not laid eyes upon her
son since she held him in her arms as she
said "Good-by and God bless you" the
morning of May 23, 1898. She it was who
was the most eager of the party. Con
strained by age she remained In the pilot
box. Xot so with the wife. On top of
the tug's cabin she secured the best place
for an early discovery and as soon as the
tug was within sight range she spied her
husband on deck. Then there was a
mutual recognition, a waving of hand
kerchiefs and a shouting of welcomes.
When the Markham reached the Grant
the yellow flag Tvas flying on the ship, and
this signal of quarantine prevented an
immediate boarding. ' About an hour later
the quarantine officers gave the ship a
Trips of Tugs to the Grant.
That is why the reception to the gen
eral was without music and noise and en
thusiasm. Preparations had been made
for a. right hearty welcome by a citizens'
committee composed of his quondam com
rades and his other friends. But the
color and life of it was sacrificed on an
altar of respect and reverence- for the de
parted President. As it was. General
Smith felt the sincerity of the greeting-,
expressing his appreciation in smiles and
much handshaking.
The welcome given to General Smith
â¢was rather an informal one, due to the
existence of the national grief. His arrival
on a dull, gray day, with the streets lined
with mourning colors and sorrow in the
air, made his home-coming a quiet affair.
Not until a few hours before landing did
General Smith know of the assassination
or the dea-th of the President- Off Point
Reyes a passing schooner hailed the Grant
and the news was shouted 'across the
waters. "We did not believe it at first,"
said Smith, "but when we caught sight of
the harbor the flags at halfmast told their
tale."
Welcome Is Subdued.
More than three years of the "strenu
ous life" in the islands has left nothing of
an evil mark. General Smith is in line
fettle. His face is just as round, his eye
is as bright and his manner as hearty as
ever it was. He has just 105 days to re
main away from his Judicial labors and
duties and he says he will make the best
of them "in the only land worth living in,
after all."
Like all who have had a. taste of mili
tary adventure and life in the Philip
pines, General Smith is very glad to feel
ihe pavements of his own city under his
feet once again.
STAKDING on the deck of the
transport Grant, smiling and now
and then shaking- hands with him
self because he could not grasp
those of his friends on the tugs
that bobbed up and down on the lee side
of the ship, James F. Smith, general, col
lector of customs and judge, drank in a
bit of the tubdued welcome yesterday
afternoon upon his return to San Fran
cisco.
Three years ago last May "Jim" Smith
marched down Market and Third streets
at the head of the First California Regi
ment, bound for Manila. Since that time
he has become a warrior, a military gov
ernor, a collector of customs and a judge.
This is his first visit to his native land
since that memorable day when all San
Francisco turned out to bid him and the
boys back of him a hearty godspeed. He
was Colonel then. Now "Jim' Smith is
a Justice of the Supreme Court of Manila.
His friends call his plain "Jim," his ac
quaintances "general," the title bestowed
upon him by the Government in recogni
tion of hls-*ervJces.

satisfaction of reporting the full roster of

bian legation officials to-night > expressed
the viewi that the Colombian insurrection
was ; practically-- suppressed. . In .support
of this statement they said that the in
surgents did not hold a single village in
Colombia, .although some band3 of
marauders were giving, trouble, and those
on whom the rebel forces had counted
General -Alban added:' "Colombia and
her Government have nothing . to fear
from the Government of Venezuela, who
are opposed to -war and - strongly;'con
demn Castro's 'aggressive â¢ policy." The
general asserts; that the prisoners cap
tured-at the battle of Goagira were all
Venezuelans, who said they had been
torn from their homes and forced to fight
against Colombia under penalty of being
clubbed to death. . " â¢
President Castro has published, on different
occaEior.s, statements declaring that Colombia
hes provoked â¢ the situation, now all but war,
between the two republics. President Castro,
who has several times set fire to our country
and sowed the eeeds of revolution, now, cries
to the whole world, "Voila, Messieurs!' It is
Colombia who desires to enter and burn my
house. - I have done nothing to her, -although
my 6oldiers and my battalions entered her
territory and thousands of my troops-have
been slain In battle I while abetting her rebel
cause. I have done nothing to her, though I
gave them arms and money and newspapers
in which to publish what they listed. - I have
done nothing to her, 'though It was I who sum
moned General. Uribe-Url be; from the United
States, expressly for an invasion of her terri
tory. It is not likely that his army, consist
ing of 1500 troops, which I supplemented by
men, arms and munitions of war when â¢ near
the- frontier and ready to penetrate into Colom-"
bla, met with signal defeat- at the hands of
forces under Kangel Garblras. It was, I who
recently addressed the following telegram to
the Governor of the State of Zubla, which, af
ter having been found in a portfolio belonging
to General Socalras, who was slain at the battle
of Goaglra, Â¦ Colombia, is now triumphantly
published. The telegram- read: . 'General Da
vala shortly leaves with a thousand men, am-~
munition, artillery and steamers destined to
Rio Hacha to reinforce the expedition under
General Castillo.' " .
COLON, Colombia, via Galveston, Sep
tember 18.â General . Alban, the Com
mander-in-chief- of the Colombian forces,
in an interview to-day regarding the
statement which Torres Cardenas, the
Foreign Secretary of Venezuela, tele
graphed from Caracas on August 17 on
behalf 6f President Castro,, said:

FOR THE STRIFE
The progress of the royal pair through
the thronged streets was a prolonged ova
tion. The municipal reception, which
was planned for to-night in honor of the
Duke and Duchess, was abandoned on ac
count of the death of President McKinley,
but the city was brilliantly illuminated
and there was a torchlight procession and
a display of fireworks. As a further
mark of respect to the American people
in their mourning there will be no public
functions to-morrow. The Duke is to re
ceive a degree at McGill University and
he and the Duchess will make a number
of private visits.
At the conclusion of the address 140
veterans of the South African war were
called into the stand and presented with
sen-ice medals. As the Duke handed
each man his medal he briefly thanked
him for his patriotism and valor. The
crowds behind the long lines of troops
cheered wildly as the rewarded soldiers
filed from the stand. At the conclusion
of the ceremony at the station the royal
party were escorted co their carriages
and under guard of a strong military de
tachment were driven to the home of Lord
Strathcona. ' .

royal couple to the house of Lord Ptrath

posal.
The party proceeded first to a beautiful
ly decorated stand in front of the sta
tion, where, under a banner inscribed,
"God Prosper Our United Empire," Mayor
Prefontaino read an address of welcome.
The Duke, in reply, referred to his own
two previous visits to the city and that of
his father. King Edward, in 1860, and ex
pressed his thanks for the kindly recep
tion given him.
for allies, were unlikely to give further
material aid. Curacao press advices to
the legation allege that many of Presi
dent Castro's supporters in the interior
of Venezuela are protesting against his
anti-Colombian aggressiveness. Accord
ing to the legation, the defeat of a Nica
raguan force recently will stop further
hostile movements from that quarter.
Members of the legation say they under
stood that the Nlcaraguan Government
has given assurance to the American
Minister that it will not-wage war. on

"American capital Is being : placed In
Manila and in all the islands, but the
English had the lead. Not until very re
cently did the American care to invest
in Philippine properties. Promoters of all
kinds are now on the scene and the Isl
ands really offer good opportunities.

now see and appreciate that the law and

General Smith has this to say about
Manila: "Conditions are improving rap

At the wharf carriages were in waiting,
and General Smith, his wife and mother
on either arm and his son Cyril in front,
got into an open one. They were driven
to the California Hotel, followed by an
escort composed of civilians and soldiers.
General Smith and his Filipino "family"
left the Grant and boarded the Markham
to be carried - to the city. As soon as he
stepped aboard the tug he was pulled into
the pilot box and from that time until the
landing -al the Mission-street wharf he
was in the hands of his wife and mother.
There was much to say between mother
and son, yet little was uttered. It was a
reunion that none on the Markham cared

NEW YORK. Sept 18.â People who argued
that thr sudden weakness that developed in
the etock market yesterday afternoon after
the early chow of strength was due to the
frost scar* In the corn bolt, found confirmation
for tljelr views In the recover}' In the stock
market to-day simultaneously with the re
action In corn. The loss of all yesterday's rise
in the price of corn showed an eagerness to
realize on Jong lines that took the 'edge' off
the apprehension regarding the reported fur
ther damage to the corn crop. The effect of
thii development was naturally most pro
nounced in the stocks of the great Western
railroads, whose traffic Is large In corn, name
ly, the grangers and Pacifies, Including Atchi
*on and Missouri Pacific. But there was no
reason why the developments In the corn mar
ket should have a sympathetic effect on rall
i-oads In Southern territory, those carrying
anthracite and bituminous coal and the net
work of central traffic and minor Eastern trunk
lines which are usually designated as Junior
Vanderbilts. Prices of all of those stocks were
notably buoyant and the buying of them was
on a scale which could be only for the ac
count of largest local Interests. Buying was
â¢without any tspecific news to explain it. It
was attributed to . the same sources .. as that
Â¦which constituted the determined support of
the market all .through the recent crisis. The
public in Wall street waa Btrong.ln the. con
viction that what are called the Vanderbilt.
Morgan. Gould. Rockefeller and Harriman in
terests were all buyers on a very large scale
of the various stocks In which they are in
terested. Speculators and professional opera
tors exhausted the best powers of conjecture In
striving to discover the motive of this' buy-
Ing. As there was no acute pressure of liqui
dation, the mere purpose to support the mar
ket was not sufficient explanation, as it wab
on last Friday and on Monday. There was
considerable cross trading . early In , the day
which had the appearance of an effort to con
fuse sentiment, brokers usually , acting for

CHICAGO, Sept. 18.â Frost was the dominant
factor again to-day in the corn market and the
opening was excited and higher. The whole
corn belt had been nipped according , to reports
and the feeling -was that yesterday's heavy
buying would be renewed. With this Decem
ber started %@%c higher at 61@60Uc There
was, however, a conspicuous absence of .yes
terday's demand and longs who bought yester
day began to realize profits until December
slumped off to - 5S%c. Frosts were predicted
again for to-night, but that prospect did not
seem to influence the market. Covering 1 by
shorts and general evening up of contracts for
to-morrow's holiday steadied prices at the de
cline and December reacted to 59140. The close,
however, was weak, l%c lower at 58%c.
Wheat was dull and heavy and in the ab
sence of individual Influences followed corn
closely. Outside support was lacking and the
large amount that was carried over last night
was thrown over. December opened %(&>,ic
higher to a shade lower at 72V6@71%c. Liquida
tion set the price down to 70?4c, where the
market became a narrow one. The reaction in
corn brought the price back to 71V4c but De
cember closed weak, %c lower at 71@71Hc.
Oats opened steady. December V4@%c lower
at 37%<337c. Considerable selling by holders
weakened the market along . with corn. The
close was %c lower at 36%c.
Provisions were quiet and steady. They were
higher in sympathy with. the early strength in
grains. January pork closed 7%c up, lard 10c
higher and ribs with a gain of 5c.

GOVERNMENT TIMBER
Two Shasta County Settlers Who Â£>
pent of a Recent Speculation
in Shakes.
Thomas McCoy and Collins Ritts wera
convicted by a jury in the United States
District Court yesterday on an indictment
charging them with illegally cutting tim
ber on Government land in Shasta Coun
ty, north of Whitmore. They were or
dered to appear on Saturday for sentence.
Charles H. Ritts, brother of one of the
defendants, was also indicted, but he
kept out of the way of the United Statea
Marshal and has not yet been arrested.
It is alleged that the trio cut a large
quantity of sugar pine off four sections
of Government land, most of which they
made up into shakes.
A civil action is pending in the United
States Circuit Court to recover a large
sum as damages from the persons who
purchased the shakes and lumber from
the defendants.

tionality of the ordinance which went

in' Judge Cabanlsa* court yesterday for the

PITTSBURG, Sept. 18.â At a meeting to

were present, it was dec ded by unanimous
vote to repudiate the New York agree

representatives of the two lodges con
ferred with J. W. Phillips, district man

The Republican local convention will
meet at B'nai B'rith Hall next Thurs
day evening. It is doubtful if nomina
tions will be reached this evening, as
much time will be taken in the discus
sion of resolutions from the platform
committee. The programme, which was
thrown aside at the session last Monday
evening, provided in effect that H. G. W.
Dinkelspeil is not even a member of the
committee on resolutions and in that ca
pacity would be able to present a ready
made Dlatforro to the convention. As a
result of the disaster to the programme,
Dinkelspiel is not even a member of the
platform committee. In the Forty-first
District delegation he is one of the Dib
ble minority of three members, hence he
was not selected to represent -the dis
trict on the committee.
It is the general impression among poli
ticians that many of the delegates who
were nominated on the tacit understand
ing that they would accept a programme,
have, in the light of subsequent events,
resolved on independent line of action. At
the present time there is no slate. John C.
Kirkpatrick, George Stone and Thomas
V. Cator are spoken of as leading candi
dates for Mayor. 'Colonel Stone attends
the funeral of President McKlnley at
Canton to-day. As a department com

body off the bed and thus break his neck.
Both these attempts were frustrated by
the police watching him. Jones had been
feeling badly for several days and wa3

OAKLAND, Sept. 18â A pretty
" home wedding took place yester
day afternoon at the residence of
Mrs. Mary Hewlitt .in East Oak
land, when her eldest' daughter.
Miss Carrie Pauline Hewlitt, became the
bride of George Gillott Jamieson. The
marriage was solemnized in accordance
with the rites of the Episcopal service,
Rev. William Carson Shaw, rector of the
Church of the Advent, officiating.
One of his train crew had set the switch
of a "crossover" in such manner that
when the freight went ahead it was
turned on to the main track. Engineer
Sheldon did not notice the switch quickly
enough to enable him to, stop his train,
and before he realized the express dashed
on the other track. ; .
â¢ The engine of the express and the bag
gage car succeeded in getting by before
the freight engine reached the train, but
the second car of the train, the smoker,
was struck squarely In the middle and
turned over, being thrown down the
steep embankment, landing on its side in
mud. The third car of the train, a pas
senger coach, was dragged over by the
force of the compact and likewise landed
on Its side in the ditch. All those who
were killed outright seemed to be in the
third car, while those injured were in the
car which was struck by the engine. â¢
â¢The accident occurred at the Avon'sta
tion, by the side of a high embankment.
The express was one minute behind time
at Avon at 1:37. A freight train of thirty
cars laden with granite, coal and gravel
had just made up on a siding and was
proceeding south in the same direction
as the express. Engineer Sheldon of the
freight train figured that he had four
minutes to spare to get on a sidetrack
further down.
The two unidentified bodies are those of
women, one elderly and very large in fig
ure. The other unidentified victim was
apparently 28 years old, with light hair,
evidently a Swede. Â¦ . . â¢

James Munsell Jr.. a well-known insur
ance man of San Francisco, died last
night at hie residence in this city. He
was taken sJck last Friday, the day of
the President's death, but serious results
were not expected, he grieved constant
ly for the dead President and this is be
lieved to have prevented him from rally
ing. He was sixty-three years of age and
the California agent for the Mutual Ben
efit Life Insurance Company. He leaves
a widow and two children. The funeral
Â¦will take place on Saturday afternoon
from Trinity Episcopal Church.
Mr. Ench was one of the leading mem
bers of the Oakland Lodge of Elks. He
had always taken a great interest in the
order and was revered by the members
as a. friend and brother. The funeral
will take place Friday afternoon at 2
o'clock, the Elks taking entire charge of
the services.
Frank Ench was one of the builders
of the famous monitor constructed by
Jtthn Ericsson. Ench was a native of
Germany, but came to this country when
but nine months of age. He became a
skilled mechanic and was chosen by
Ericsson to help him build his vessel that
revolutionized the bulldinsr of war ves
sels. After the war between the States
- Cr.ch went to Mexico, where he engaged
v.n mining, and at the time of his death
tie owned the La Dura mines in the State
of Sonora. He married In Mexico, his
first wife dying after the birth of one
son. He married Miss Christ of San Ra
faej fourteen years ago and she survives
him with six children.
Frank Ench died last night at his East
Oakland home from heart disease. He had
not been well of late and last night went

Passes Away.
secretary of the Carpenters' Union wrote:
"No. we don't favor manual training in
schools, as It would give a boy - Ideas, and
we have too many ideas now." The secretary
of the Bricklayers' Union, said: "WÂ« be
llevo that the present manner of producing
mechanics and foreign immigration is fully
equal to the demand." Another &ald:
"Americans are not wanted In the trades.
If educated they would not obey union orders
unless convinced of their wisdom, nor pay as
sessments without an accounting."
By excluding American apprentices 'from
the shops and excluding American boys who
learn trades in the trade schools, and claim
ing the right to inflict the death penalty upon
non-union workmen, foreign influence and
power have effectually deprived American
youth of Its lawful birthright. To the youth
of the land we must look for the preservation
of the spirit of Americanism But deprived
of their birthright we find thousands of Ameri
can boys confined as incorrigibles In the State
reform schools. Idleness has wrought Its evil
work upon them and they fester in the vices
of association, .while the ranks of their perse
cutors are recruited by an immigration that
lakes the places which they should fill.
All this Is done under the pretense that the
high wages of this country ace caused by the
efforts of the union leaders. This I deny. We
had the highest wages in the world when we
were colonies of Great Britain and have con
tinued to advance wages as the productivity
of labor has Increased by the use of labor
aiding machinery. Granting that wages have
been somewhat advanced by union organiza
tion, that advance has been more than dis
counted by the economic losses caused by the
industrial wars declared by the walking dc-le
gates and union leaders. One great establish-,
ment in San Krancisco practically closed *by
the strike of last May was paying $240,000 per
month in wages. The loss to Its workmen
alone now reaches a million of dollars. A
conservative estimate of the loss to Califor
nia by the existing strike is J20.000.000. As
this loss paralyzes trade, bankrupts men and
brings want everywhere, Its final effect i% to
injure labor by producing conditions . that
makes the demand for. It less.
Cannot Tolerate Two Governments.
The American people cannot tolerate j two
governments. The laboring man pays . his
share of taxes to his Government for its pro
tection of his lawful right to labor. But In
addition to this he must pay his initiation
lees and assessments to a union leader or he
is not allowed to earn his bread. It is a Eys
tem oi double taxation, and the tax paid to
the union is 'the price of his license to exer
cise a right which the Government guarantees
to him.
I by no means cry. out against foreign im
migration. If it come here to obey the laws
and be American In act and sentiment. It is
welcome and wholesome. But If It come
here to set up a Government within a Gov
ernment and base that upon the right to as
sassinate Americans who' are lawfully and
loyally following our Industrial occupations
necessary to community life, it is not enly
unwelcome, it is un-American, treasonable and
undeserving of the least toleration. We say
te it, "Take your hand off the American boy.
His person is sacred. He Is the fruit of our
rublic schools. He Is the hope of the repub
lic. He shall learn trades whether you like it
or not, and earn his bread in their practice
whether you license him or not. When you
sentence him to death fpr this, you are at
tempting to assassinate this republic, and' It
will crush you to powder.".
At the conclusion of Coloel Irish's ad
dress five-minute replies were given by
advocates of trades unionism. . M. B.
AVllkins propounded the question, "Why
Is it that if the country is so prosperous
as it is claimed there have been found
enough idle men to take the places of
25,000 strikers?"
Colonel Irish replied that the law of
supply and demand applied here. Strikers
had gone into the country to work and
forced country labor to come to the city.
There were really no idle men.
John Aubrey Jones pleaded for a more
general application of the doctrine of the
brotherhood of man.
"I l-elieve in the brotherhood of man."
said Colonel Irish, "but I- don't believe in
the brotherhood of fifteen or twenty men
that takes a workingman into a blind
alley and beats him into insensibility."
Herman Whlttaker said conditions* had
been improved by the labor unions and
denounced the trusts, to which the
speaker, replied that unions should have
the same legal restrictions as corpora
tions. .
MEN TO LEAD
PARTY FORCES
The report of the Labor Commissioner of
New York prints the answers of sixty-five
irad> unions showing their policy to be the
-exclusion from the trades of American boys.
The Plasterers' Union In Xew York com
pelled employers to sign an agreement that
no one should be permitted to learn the trade
for seven years. The secretary of the Fin
ish***' Union said: "If a boy become a. full
fledged mechanic in a technical -school he
would not know anything 'about unions." The
Exclusion of American Boys.
The Milwaukee labor riots of 18S6 were led
by two foreigners who had been less than eight
months In this country. The New York Labor
Commissioner reports that labor disturbances
are almost invariably led by foreigners. That
class In the New York Labor Convention of
1S88 demanded repeal of the State laws against
industrial conspiracy and of all laws against
the use of violence toward non-union men. The
Century Magazine, after a comprehensive In
quiry Into the policy of the labor union leaders.
f=aid that "the American boy has no rights
which organized labor Is bound to respect. He
is denied Instruction as an apprentice, and if
he be taught his trade in a trade school he
Is refused admission to nearly all the trade
unions, which are controlled by foreigners.
V.'hlle they reject the American boy they admit
all foreigners with but little regard to their
degree of skill."
These leaders, usually of foreign birth or
sentiments, have found It necessary to have
foreign material in the unions In order to con
trol them. In New Jersey 62 per cent of the
members of the unions are foreigners. In Illi
nois â¬S per cent are foreigners. In New York
a majority are foreigners. Mr. Furuseth, nead
of the San Francisco Water Front Federation,
has recently stated that 60 per cent of the
members of his union are foreigners, not citi
zens of the United States, and only 5 per cent
of them married.
It is pleaded by union leaders, walking dele
gates and business agents, most of them for
eigners or Americans only In the second gen
eration, that labor unions have been the potent
agency In advancing wages. Upon this premise
they base their right to license labor. I deny
this premise. The policy of these leaders is to
make themselves necessary by inciting strikes
and making demands.
Leaders Usually Foreigners.
Trade unionism is antl- American when it as
sumes powers that are denied to Government
and proposes that no man shall be permitted
to labor unless he have its license and permis
sion. The ultimate base of all government is
the power to force submission to its laws. The
assumed right of labor unions to license the
laborer being- the assumption of government
over him naturally rests upon force and is car
ried out by attacks upon the person of the un
licensed laborer who depends upon the laws
of his country to protect his right to work. In
its extreme the penalty put upon him by the
licensers of labor is death. In this code of
unionism capital punishment Is decreed against
any man who works without a union license.
We have all stood for weeks in the presence of
this assertion of power by union leaders, and
the statistics show In that period over 2000
attempts to visit capital punishment upon
American citizens for violation of the union
code. These events make it necessary to in
quire what rights they have under the laws
of their country and what means exist for their
enforcement.
Therefore it Is a mistake to assume that ob
jection to the illegal and Illegitimate use of
the power of such unions is opposition to the
lawful and praiseworthy purposes they may
subserve.
ThÂ« American revolution was a movement to
create one Government In which personal and
property rights would have equal protection of
the law. Prom that time until now It has been
believed that the right of every man to follow
his lawful vocation was primary, that It was
established In our Institutions and that the law
would permit no hand to be raised against it
Our Institutions permit the Iree association of
citizens for lawful purpose common to the as
sociates, and this permission is properly used
by any number of men occupied in the same
calling to form a guild or union for the ad
vancement of their mutual interests. Labor
unions so formed to shorten hours of labor and
increase its wage are lawful and praiseworthy
and there Is no well-founded moral or legal
objection to their existence.

Say3 Married Man Has No
Right to Change Color
of His Hair.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Sept. 18.
Because he dyed his mustache Judge
Hall decided this afternoon that Jon>i
Boehrer of Berkeley is /not entitled to a
divorce from his wife, Mary Jane Boehrer.
Judge Hall said he was convinced that
Boehrer had scandalized his family by his
determination to appear young again and
added that he did not think that any man
with a family had a right to change tha
natural color of his hair simply to make
himself, attractive to others.
The testimony of Boehrer*3 wife and two
sons, was to the effect that he had become
infatuated with a young woman who lived
in the neighborhood and the first thing
he did was to dye his mustache, which
was of a sandy color, to a deep black.
He received the woman at his house every
night in spite of the remonstrances of his
sons.
In his own behalf Boehrer denied that
he was or is interested in- the woman,
though he did not deny that he dyed his
mustache for the purpose of creating an
impression.
Judge Hall showed his deep interest in
the dyeing process by asking many ques
tions.
"I am convinced." said Judge Hall In
rendering his decision, "that this family
was greatly scandalized by the fact that
the head of it dyed his mustache and that
he was often seen in the company of the
young woman mentioned during his wife's
absence. It shows that he was carried
away with the idea of making himself
young again, which he had no moral right
to do. His sons testified that they had to
listen to ridicule on their father's account.
He is responsible for his own troubles."
Judge Hall denied the application of the
husband for divorce and ordered that he
pay his wife 540 monthly for the support
of their children.

Catarrh, is a constitutional^ diseaseâ -a blood disease which is frecmenlty
inherited, and only a blood medicine, such as S. S. S., can remove the hereditary
taint, destroy the poisons that have been accumulating in the system for years
perhaps, and restore the blood to a healthy and pure condition. The jmnamed
membranes and diseased glands are healed by the rich, pure blood which is carried
to them, and the offensive discharges from the nose, and the terrible headache aisd
neuralgic pains cease, j Chronic cases of the most desperate character and apparent-
ly hopeless, have been cured completely and permanently by the use of S. S. S. â¢

Mrs. Fuller also charges that her hus
band has conveyed to Bertha A. Smith
four holdings on First avenue, a piece of
land on Tenth avenue and the residence
at 323 Seventh avenue. She asks that %
restraining order be issued to- prevent her
husband disposing ot any property pend
ing the suit. The Smith woman Is named
as co-defendant in the suit.
Mrs. Fuller claims that her husband's
holdings are valued at $150,000, and that it
Is all community property. She says ha
Is trying to evade the community prop
erty law by encumbering and disposing
of the property.
A suit for maintenance was filed in tha
County Clerk's office yesterday by Emily
T. Fuller, wife of George H. Fuller, the
well known capitalist. In the complaint
Mrs. Fuller alleges that, though her hus
band enjoys an Income of $25,000 a year,
he allows her but J5 a week on which to
keep house. She asks the court to grant
her a monthly allowance of 1350, which
sum. she claims, is necessary to keep her
in accordance with her station In life. The
complaint further alleges that Fuller
compels his wife to go to his office every
Saturday to collect the miserable pittance
he allows her, and that he has warned her
repeatedly that in the event of her ex
penses exceeding $5 per week he would
publish in the papers that he would not
be responsible for the debts contracted by
her.

20,000 people were brought into the State

how many of them settled here, but, as

Colonist Kate Advantages.
All of those attending these conventions
are representative, substantial citizens
and will do much toward the prosperity
of the places they visit. Some idea may
be had of .the advantages \ that accrue
from these, immense excursions when one
is told that at the recent meeting of the
Mystic Shriners in- Toronto . the . local
banks did a business of $1,500,000 in excess
of their usual amount. The recent meet
ing of, the Knights Templar in Louisville
brought over I&00.000 to that city.
The Kpworth Leaguers who have ; re
turned to their homes are loud in their
praises of California, its climate, peopfe
and. scenery, and they are doing much to
advertise the -Pacific. Coast '.as , an ideal
place of permanent residence..- . â¢ â¢ - â¢

expect -to come about 7000 strong.,; Tne
Women's Clubs Convention has.beeji se
cured for Los Angeles in May -next. It

The Mystic Shriners meet here next year
and they expect a representation of over
8000. The Knights Templar will hold their
next triennial conclave here. Thia will not
take place,, however, until some, time in

In speaking of traffic matters in general
Manager McCormick said that California
was fast becoming as popular a summer
resort as it is a winter, one. People are
beginning to appreciate the evenness of
the climate of this State and to awaken
to the fact that it offers as comfortable
a refuge from the fierce heat of an East
ern summer as it does from the pneumo
nia-breeding winds of an Eastern winter.
He says that he se'es no reason why sum
mer travel in the near future should not
fully equal the winter travel of the past.

SHARP LETTER
TO GOVERNOR
* Board of Trade Accuses
Him of Dodging the
â¢ Issue.
Also Finds Inconsistency in
Position of the Ex
â¢ ecutive.
General Chipman, as president of the
State Board of Trade, has addressed a
stinging letter to Governor Gage. Therein
the Governor is accused of dodging the
issue that the State Board raised when it
expressed the opinion that protection
ought to be given to those who stood
ready to handle grain at Port Costa. The
general uses sarcasm in a passage as fol
lows:
Your elaborate exposition of the duties of
the executive and the limitations placed upon
him by the constitution and laws of the State
is wholly gratuitous, since nothing in the
memorial called for such treatment.
There is a sting: in the concluding para
graph, which reads as follows:
It is to be regretted that this phase of the
matter, wholly of your own creation, took
f>uch possession of your mind that you en
tirely overlooked the prayer of the memorial.
As the letter from Governor Gage \ was
addressed to General Chipman and Secre
tary Dennison of the State Board of
Trade, General Chipman has answered for
the board. The text of his communica
tion is as follows:
Text of Stinging Letter.
SAN FRANCISCO. SÂ£pt. 18, 1D01.
Hon. Henry T. Gage, Governor of Califor
nia. Sacramento, Cal. â Sir: Your reply to the
memorial of the California State Board of
Trade is Just received. You have so entire
ly misconceived and misstated the object of
the memorial that in justice to the board I
feel impelled to notice your communication.
An examination of . the memorial will dis
close no suggestion whatever that you call
out the militia, or that you resort to \ any
particular remedy in aid of the fanners who
are unable to move their grain because of
the pending strike. Tour elaborate exposition
of the duties of the executive and the limita
tions placed upon him by the constitution and
laws of the State is wholly gratuitous, since
nothing in the memorial called for such treat
ment. The memorial had no other object than
to call attention to the conditions which were
believed to exist and were resulting in great
loss and damage to the farming industry of
the State. A belief was expressed that if pro
tection could be given to those who stood
ready to handle the grain of the State at
Port Costa all turther embargo on grain move
ments would at once cease, and within a rea
sonable time and before the rainy season had
commenced the grain of the State could be put
under shelter in the warehouses. It was an
unwarranted assumption on your part that
you were expected forthwith to call cut the
militia; nothing was further from the thought
of the board than that. The conditions to
which reference was made were such as
seemed to the board to call for investigation
at least, and it was but reasonable to ask
a.t your hands the application of such remedy
as v.-ould give "all who wished to work the
protection of our laws, if they were not now
receiving such protection. Hence the prayer
cf the memorial:
Admission by GoVemor.
"We therelore respectfully request at your
hands such investigation of the facts as may
disclose to the executi\-e mind the necewary
remedy and the earliest practical .application
of such remedies."
If I do not misinterpret your reply, your po
sition is that you are powerless to interfere
In any way, except upon the request of the
Sheriff of Contra Costa County, and upon
euch showing by him as brings the case with-
Sn your conception of your power under the
constitution and laws. You quote the Sheriff
as saying: "If the Board of Supervisors of
Contra Costa County will defray the expenses
of pÂ° ss e comitatus I believe the trouble would
Boon be ended." Here is certainly an admis
sion that there is trouble requiring official
intervention of some character, and if given,
euch trouble "would socn be ended."
I do not vouch- for its truth, but it is etated
that a cbmmittee * of farmers of the State
composed of William Beckmann. J. Craig and
J. H. Rice, all well known citizens of this
.State, have recently called upon the Sheriff
of Contra Costa County for protection to labor
in handling the grain at Port Ccsta; that the
Sheriff made answer, as he did to you, that
he could take care of the situation If the
Supervisors would pay the expense, which he
has no assurance they will do. It appears,
therefore, that the Sheriff of Contra Costa
County is as helpless as you confess yourself
to be. Under the circumstances the farmers'
committee, it is stated, have determined to
recommend to the fanners that they come to
Port Costa with their men and in such force
as to be able to protect themselves. It it. to
be hoped that if the officers of the law can
find no justification for securing the safety
of men who desire to work they will at least
find no warrant for Interfering to prevent
those ircm working who desire to work and
stand ready to protect themselves.
â¢The board expressed no opinion, and has
none, as to who are responsible for the pres
ent situation. It respectfully Invited your at
tention to the condition and not its origin.
The board did not request you to call out the
militia, or to substitute military for civil au
thority. The discussion of these questions by
you was therefore not called for by the me
morial. It Is to be regretted that this phase
of the matter, wholly of your own creation,
look such possession of your mind that you
entirely overlooked the prayer of the memorial.
Blncerely yours. N. P. CHIPMAN,
President California State Board of Trade.

j The Southern Pacific Company. notified
the Board of Works yesterday that it will
; be unable to move its. tracks to a position
â¢about six feet west of the center line .of
1 Illinois street as required by the City En
gineer in order to allow the completion
1 of the paving at Illinois and Napa streets.
iThe reason assigned is that if placed in
such a position it will interfere with the
San Francisco and San Joaquin Railway
Company in the construction of its tracks
on. Illinois street. The Southern Pacific
Company requests thafthe location of- its
tracks be not changed until arrangements
can be made for joint use of the tracks by

. Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger delivered last
evening at the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art his first of the series of free lectures
now being given by the University of Cal
ifornia. The lecture was in the nature of
a general introduction to those that are
to follow on "The Literary History of the
Old Testament." The reverend gentleman
cut away from the usual orthodox man
ner of handling the subject and gave an
interesting narration. of the law, the his
tory and tradition and the poetry of the
Bible. The lecturer said that probably
the greatest difficulty we have in getting
a clear understanding of the Bible is
caused by the fact that it is an Oriental
work, written in an Oriental language
and atmosphere, and comes to us, an Oc
cidental/people, translated into an Occi
dental tongue, and that a literal transla
tion is therefore next to the impossible.
The lecture was attended by a cultured
and attentive audience. As factors in
public education too much cannot be said
about this work of the university, arid the
large attendance and .interest displayed
promise well for the rest of the series.

Auditor Files Annual Report.
In the afternoon Attorney Murphy was Â¦
full of all, kinds of objections, and the'
court ruled in his favor generally. When
the attractive Mamie â¢ Schneider was ;
placed on the 3tand and asked about "Sir"
Harry's statements to her sister, Murphy
objected and finally convinced Judge Law
lor that the District Attorney was pro
ceeding irregularly to prove the sending
of a forged telegram. Â¦Â¦-Â¦''- Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ , â¢
She was withdrawn and Mrs. Marie
Schneider was called. The mother of the
pretty Misses Schneider , denied having
sent or authorized any one to send the'
telegram that caused. all the trouble and
which read: Â¦Â¦Â¦<Â¦ .-.Â¦ Â¦ >/. .
/ "Nora Schneiderâ Do as Ernest. tells you
at once. MARIE SCHNEIDER."
Then the $250 diamond ring which "Sir"
Harry gave Norine prior ) to the sending
of the telegram and which was returned
to him when the falsity of his tales con
cerning his vast estates in England- were
learned by the mother was . brought into
question. -â¢.-.*
Mrs. Schneider said the. versatile "Sir"
Harry had called it a dress. ring. ....
Attorney Murphy sought an explanation
but could not fathom the meaning of the
phers at' Vallojo Junction, where 'the
Schneiders formerly resided; and to the
identification of "Sir" Harry's, writing as
displayed in a letter he had- written
while in the County. Jail to a reader of

United States District Judge de Haven
dismissed the proceedings in habeas
corpus Tuesday instituted on behalf of
John F. Corriea, convicted recently in the
Police Court of having had more than
fifty wild doves in his possession on one
calendar day. Corriea contended in his
petition that that portion of the State
game law was in violation of the consti
tution of the United States.
Judge de Haven said that In his opinion
the State law did not violate the Federal
constitution. He was of the opinion, how
ever, that the law was passed in the Inter
est of sportsmen's clubs and that the
Legislature should not have passed it and
: the- Governor should not have signed it,
but" as it was. not in conflict ,vjith the Fed
eral constitution he had no jurisdiction in
the matter. ' Corriea was ordered re
manded into custody.

So the trial went on, with' the unfolding
of the oft-repeated tale of how Norine
Schneider was deceived by. a telegram
purporting to come from her mother into
marrying "Sir" Harry.
Ethel Young, the Brisbane wife of "Sir"
Harry, was not called as a witness, and it
is not likely that she will be given an op
portunity to testify unless he is Indicted
for bigamy. The prosecution was in hopes
that Attorney Murphy would. object to the
testimony of Norine Schneider on the
ground that she was the wife of "Sir"
Harry. Then the District Attorney would
usher in Esther Young- and prove by her
that Norine Schneider was not the wife of
the defendant, but that Miss Young was.
Miss Young has a -dark tale to . unfold
about the life of "Sir" Harry, but Attor
ney Murphy was shrewd enough to avoid
having It presented at this time. =
