satisfactory. Mr. Kruger is believed "to
be slowly growing weaker physically and
mentally. His slowness In reaching a de
cision on important questions is 1 found to
be a serious hindrance to those working
in Europe in behalf of the Boer cause.
At the slightest question regarding his
health Mr. Kruger exhibits intense irri

not strong. The approach of winter
causes anxiety, as Mr. Kruger refuses to.
leave Holland.
According to a remark made by a prom

Rudyard Kipling In a striking: letter to

out his light sails and still held the Columbia's
sheets in slat. Thus he, too,' handicapped his
boat in crossing,- but not so much' as his rival,
for it is estimated that he was only fifteen
seconds behind the handicap gun. Spinnakers
on both boats were broken â¢ out on â¢ the Â¦ line
and away they went on what proved to be the
last raeÂ«. of the international series of 1901..
Handicapped at the Start.
Both boats began handicapped. ; The I official
time of the start as posted on the ; bulletin
board of the committee boat was as follows: ..
Shamrock '....:. ...... ..11:02:00

Hardly . had the boats got over the line 1 be
fore it was seen that the Shamrock was gain
ing on her rival. Slowly she crept up and at
' 11:17 was on even terms. Half a minute later
she showed her bowsprit ahead and from there
on - she led the Columbia to the outer mark.
The run down the wind; was uneventful after
the Shamrock took the lead, except. at a few,
momenta before the turn, when the Columbia,
catching first a fresh puff of wind, ran up on
the challenger's weather quarter. The' boats
were then very- near the turning buoy, so
that ' the Shamrock took in her spinnaker and
balloon Jib and set with a greater speed than
had yet been showed. by. the British \ crew her
Jib and staysail. As soon as these two head
sails filled with wind the British boat luffed
out under the bow of the Columbia, tqok on
new life and romped ahead again. Columbia
kept her spinnaker. until within two minutes
of the mark, hoping with, this additional sail
to pull up." But she was unable to do so, : and.
had to turn forty-nine seconds behind her rival..

Pandemonium Follows.
Â£ The usual pandemonium that attends
the final Yankee victory in a cup contest
followed. Whistles, sirens, bells, bands
&nd cheers united in a grand chorus ot
jubilation, and J. P. Morgan's yacht Cor
sair added to .the terrific din by firing a
national salute of twenty-one guns.
After the Columbia had hauled down her
sails and set her victory flag the excur
sion boats crowded alongside to cheer the
Yankee sailors and the winning skipper.
Nor did. they forget Sir Thomas Lipton or
his gallant craft. In turn the crowded
steamers ran alongside the Shamrock and
Erin and the vanquished received almost
as much honor as the victor. And thus,
with felicitations all around, the twelve
series of races for the old cup which the
schooner America brought over fifty years
ago erded with the best of feeling.
Taking his defeat gamely, Sir Thomas
Lipton yet made no attempt to conceal
the keenest - disappointment when he
talked about the races to-night on the
Erin.
Sir Thomas' Disappointment.
"I am very much disappointed." he said.
"I thought that within fifteen minutes
of the finish that we had won. I was as
sure as my life we had won. When I
looked around the situation had changed
and we had lost. It was a hard blow to
be so near winning and then to lose. I
should like to have got one race, just by
way of consolation. It is a very hard
thing to be beaten by a breathâ by a few
beats of the pulse. It has been a severe
strain on me. J have worked so hard for
many months now and I am glad It Is
over. To have won would have been a
Joy greater than to-day's disappointment.
The Columbia's win to-day was fair and
square and honorable. There is nothing
to protest if I wanted to protest. In fact,
I have a feeling in my heart that if there
had been any- error in judgment at all It
would have been in my favor. If there
had been any possibility of choice in the
matter I believe the yacht club would
have given me the race. Sometimes â¢ a
man has the better boat, but even having
it must have a wee bit of luck to win. I
am very grieved indeed, very grieved,
and." he added. "I should have liked to
have Â¦won one race."
Hardly had the Erin's anchors touched
bottom when a launch from the yacjit
Corsair came alongside bearing the
regatta committee of the New York Yacht
Club. Sir Thomas met them. at the hÂ»ad
of the gangway and as he shook hands
with them individually he said:
"Gentlemen, It was a lair beat. I want
to :--ay again that you have treated . me
with the utmost -fairness and courtesy.
You have met everv wish of mine, and
from my heart I thank you."
Lipton a True Sportsman.
Commodore Lewis Cass Ledyard, chalr-
man of the New York Yacht Club regatta
committee, replied:
"Sir, we have never had a truer sports
man to deal with."
Many of Sir Thomas' guests on board
the Erin crowded around. to express their
sympathy at his defeat and assured him
of the high place he had won in the hearts
of all Americans.
"When a. man wins a heart he has won
more than a cup," said one . of them.
There were tears in thÂ« Irish Baronet's
eyes when he thanked them for their
kind words. Said he: â¢
"The words you have spoken touch me
more than my defeat to-day.. I tried to
win the cup and I* have done my best.
But better than all that. I have the good
wishes of this country."
When asÂ«ecl about his plans for the
future Sir Thomas said: .
"It is too early to talk about any plans.
About the Shamrock I cannot decide yet
what I shall do and as to challenging
again, it Is top soon to think about it."
E. D. .Morgan, the manager of the Co
lumbia, said: .
"I am very happy that we won and glad
that the strain is over. We certainly had
to make a splendid fight for it. We had a
splendid captain and a splendid crew."
The Columbia's mainsail was unbent be
fore she came to anchor and soon after
dark she was towed to City Island. Be
fore leaving Captain Barr said: â¢
"We did the best we could and they did
the best they could and we came out first.
That's all."
At the New York Yacht Club to-night
Chairman Kane and Secretary Oddie were
closely questioned by members regarding
the sensational finish. Kane said lie had
difficulty in timing, the yachts, but was
fortunate In sighting them at the proper
range. , The range was from a small white
flag on the committee boat and the main
mast of the Sandy Hook lightship.
Chester Grlswold, of the regatta club held

could fetch by the lightship. -
At 3:30 the Shamrock went about on the

the line. The Columbia tacked under her leÂ«,

of the challenger. On they came, the Ameri

to cheer, for It was then a certainty that the
gallant yacht was well within her time allow
ance if she could not cross first.
â rThe Shamrock was first to luff across, but
hardly was. this perceptible before Barr did
the same thing with the Columbia and they
went over only two seconds apart. But the two
seconds were to the credit of the Shamrock in
actual time, though she was a beaten boat
according to the rules of the game.
SUPREME DISAPPOINTMENT.
London Paper Suggests That Yachts
Exchange Crews and Then Bace.
LONDON, Oct. 5.â There Is a feeling of su
preme disappointment in London over the fail
ure of the Shamrock II to win even a single
lace. Those "who denounced Str Thomas Lip
ton's ambitlcn, asserting that he was using
his' yacht to advance his business interests,
now realize that his sportsmanlike efforts de
served a better result. The question is raised
here whether the defeat of the challenger waa
due to the' superiority of. American seaman
ship or the better constructive ability of the
Americans. With a view of settling the ques
tion the Daily Express has cabled Commodore
Morgan and Sir Thomas Llpton. suggesting
that they should arrange a race with the Co
lumbia's crew on board the Shamrock II and
the crew of the challenger on board the de
fender. - Â¦ .
The n:orning papers are unanimous in admit
ting that the challenger waa fairly and
squarely beaten by a better boat. ~ - â¢
Most . ef the papers are gratified that Sir
Thomas Lipton's public-spirited action should
have .stimulated international good trill, be
sides resultinr in the finest and closest race
ever witnessed in the history of yachting.
The Daily Chronicle says far more im
portance than the result of the contest itself
is the friendly spirit in which It was waged
from the start to the finish. "Sir Thomas
Llpton says ha would rather win American
good will than ths cur>. and we eannot doubt
that, though he had missed the latter he has
gone far to attest the former and Infinitely
more important purpose."
"Sir Thomas Llpton." observes the Standard,
"has shown himself a true sportsman. He de
serves the gratitude of the English people for
the splendid front he has made."
the Shamrock. The two boats held along to
gether on the same tack for five or six min
utes. -Then Shamrock .put about and at 1:05
crossed the Columbia's bows and tacked well
on the American boat's" weather. Then, ex
actly - as was the case yesterday and almost
at the same time of the day, 1:12, another dra
matic event of the race occurred.
In three minutes the Columbia passed clean
through the lee of the challenger, went on the
port tack and easily crossed her bows. The
Shamrock at once tacked under the defender's
lee and then, developed a situation that could
not be explained unless by change of wind.
Â¦ While the Columbia kept on pointing very
high the Shamrock headed far oft to leeward
and for several .minutes did not point any
where near as high as the Columbia and rap
idly fell off. The wind had now dropped ma
terially and It soon became fluky as well, first
one boat getting it in puffs and then the other.
At times there was a great difference in their
pointing, . the. Columbia now holding . well up,
while the Â¦ Shamrock fell off, and then again
the reverse was true. . . Â¦ . .
At 1:30 the boats were standing along on the
port tack." but wide apart. The Columbia was
well to windward, the distance estimated by
some of the yachting sharps at nearly a "mile,
but at the same time she was slightly astern.
A series of short tacks was begun by both
racers and in these the Shamrock showed evi
dent gains, being aided by friendly slants of
wlnflr For half an hour these short tacks con
tinued and when at 2 o'clock the boats came
together near enough to afford comparison It
was seen thftt the challenger had. made up a
large part, if not all, of her loss: The wind,
meanwhile, had become more and more fluky
and was blowing not over seven or eight knots.
Instead of being a good test of sailing the race
now -became a matter of luck in getting, and
good seamanship in meeting, the varying pufts.
At the same .time It became a very close affair
and there was interiss excitement in- the sight
seeing fleet. .... â¢Â¦
Nerve-Straining Finish. -.. ~
A. few minutes before 2 o'clock Barr put the
Columbia about on. the ! starboard I tack and
headed for the Jersey shore. A minute later
the Shamrock followed, and it was then seen
beyond possibility of doubt that the -American
boat was not only to windward, but was

fast dropping, but the boats were within five
miles of the finish line and had plenty of time
in which to cross the limit unless the breeze
fell to a flat calm. It became anybody's race
and the excitement ' increased. A few .more
short tacks and the British boat added to her
lead, by favoring, puffs. Seamanship cf â¢ the

TEN INNING GAME
ENDS IN A TIE
Los Angeles and Oak
land in Sensational
Contest.
Householder's Home Run and
Mohler's Great Throw
the Features.
Oakland and Los Angeles played an
other ten-inning- game yesterday at Rec
reation Park. It was called on account of
darkness with the score 5 to 5. The game
was a contest from first to last and was
replete with clever plays.
In the eigtith Mohler, on second, threw
Dougherty out at third. He stopped what
looKed like a safe hit by Householder and
slammed It down to third. Dougherty
apparently expected to score on the . hit
but Captain Reilly, Â¦who was on -the coach-
Ing line, stopped him as he would surely
have been caught out at the plate. In
the confusion Dougherty was tagged out,
retiring the side.
Los Angeles started well, getting two
runs in the second. It secured another m
the sixthâ a home run by Householder :
over the center-field fence. The men from
the south added two more In the ninth.
When Oakland went to the bat for its
turn in the ninth it had three runs to its
creJlt. Moskiman hit safe. He went to
third on Babbitt's two-lÂ»agger and scored
on a hit by Dunleavy. Croll bunted, scor
ing Babbitt, tieing- the score. Neither
fide scored In the tenth and Umpire
Hardie called, the game on account of
darkness.
Lohman and Reitz were put out of the,
game In the tenth for "kicking" without
cause. The score:

EVILS OF IRRESPONSIBLE JOURNALISM.
With Commodore Hodgson still' on the stand
the opurt adjourned until to-morrow. It is
understood that Hodgson will be examined
to-morrow about a series of letters which have
passed between himself and Admiral Schley.
and which were shown to a number of the per
sons in the courtroom to-day.
"Have you ever given this estimate as nearer
than that?"
"Yes. sir."
"What have- you given it before?" "v
"One hundred and fifty yards."
"Why do you change it now?"
"Because I have read from my. notes written
the day after the battle and from notes I used
on the Board of Navigation. I concluded from,
those that my estimate at that time when- I
gave it 175 to 250 yards was too near. Also.
I waa very much influenced by the thought
that the navigating officer of the Texas would
not think it was less than 150 yards."
"Just read* from your notes."
The witness (reading) â We quickly put our
helm aport and then around to starboard,, pass
ing well inside the Texas. That was written
by me the day after the battle.
."Is. there any reference to the distance yon
were from the Texas in those notes?" . ,
"No, sir."
"Do you remember whether anything was
said about blanketing the fire of the Texas
at that time?"
Hodgson Was Skittish.
"When I told the commodore I thought we
would run into the Texas, I think I did say
we might get shot from one of her big guns."
"Have you ever said that you were 'skittish'
about a collision with the Texas at this timer*
"Well, I was 'skittish' about It. I thought
we were going to have a collision very likely
with the Texas."
"How was the collision averted from what
you know of your own knowledge?" Â¦ â¢
"By our getting around so quick we passed
ahead of her."
"You cannot tell me what was done aboard
the Texas?"
"I have no Idea." -. .
The judge advocate then questioned Com
modore Hodgson about changes in the log of
the Brooklyn giving . the account of the fa
mous loop. The witness said that Lieutenant
Doyle had written it but that witness had
given Doyle all the data for it. .
"What information did you give him with
reference to the direction in which the helm
was put in turning the vessel?" :â¢..-.-;
"I told him helm was put aport. If I men
tioned that particular Incident."
"Do you remember whether you mentioned it
or not?"
"No, I am not sure that I mentioned it ex
cept that we turned around- to head for the
Spanish ships."
"That was a very Important move, waa It
not?"
"Yes, sir; I put it in. my log."
"What do you mean by your log?"
"Well, the logs of the forenoon and afternoon
watch were written up by Lieutenant Doyle and
Lieutenant Wasster, but as both those gentle
men had been (one in the turret and the other
on the gun deck) fighting the batteries I gave
them a number of points that might enable
them to write their deck log correctly. After
they had written up their log I went to the
captain and told him I would like to put in a
little information of my ow^j to make it more
complete, and there was an addendum written
that day by myself, and I think that In that
will be found the way the helm waa put."
"When was that addendum made and put
In?"
"Before noon, on the day following, as the
log was generally copied before noon.'
"Do you remember any discussion on board
the Brooklyn as to the direction the helm was
put when she made what is known aa the
'loop?* "
"Well, I think I remember the fact of putting
an interlineation in this log, because an erasure
was made of that word "starboard" and I sug
gested putting in the explanatory words that
we cleared the Texas."
Change in the Log.
"Do you remember whether any change was
made 'in the logbook in the recording of the
direction in which the helm waa originally
put?"
"I think I remember that erasure. The wort
'starboard' was erased and the word 'port' sub
stituted."
"Do you remember discussing that in the
presence- of Commodore Schley and Captain
Cook?"
"I do not."
"How was this first brought to your attention
that it was entered in the body of the log that
the helm was put to starboard?"
"Very likely by the watch officer wanting to
make an erasure in the log after I rad ex
amined It."
"Do you remember, if at all. you undertook to
check the log aa written to show whether these
points were correctly entered in the logbook or
not?"
"No, I do not. except that it Is more prob
able this was all done before noon of the suc
ceeding day, because the log was generally
given to the captain by noon."
"Do you regard that as a correct entry la
the logbook, that the helm was put to port
in order to bring the starboard., battery to
bear?"
"Xo, that was not the reason for which the
helm was put to port. It was put to port to
bring the Brooklyn around aa quickly as pos
sible to head oft the Spanish vessels."
"Would not the Brooklyn have been brought
around quarter if the helm had been put to
starboard, as it waa recorded In the logbook
originally?"
"I think she would."
"These words, 'swinging clear of the fire of
the Texas.* are they rl^ht?"
"That is right. That la a point that lm-'
pressed me. Fortunately we got around with
out having one of the Texas' guns fired over
us." . . . t 
"The -v-^rds, 'clear of the fire of the Texas,'
are the interlined words, are they not?"
"They are."
"Did you give any specific instructions, or
make . any specific suggestions to . the officer
who wrote the log with regard to putting in
those words?" . .
"I think It is Very possible I did.' I think it
more than probable that I did, because that
was the fact that Impressed me as the result
of swinging* -with, the port helm. I was very
thankful we cleared the Texas and ber fire."
"Then, were those words put in relative 'to.
the change la the logbook from 'starboard to
'port"*" ?
"I cannot say; I was not at that time con
templating any such, searching Investigation
as this and consequently I thought that the
log was written with the idea of giving a gen
eral and fair account of the battle without be
ing .brought up under searching scrutiny, or I
would have been more particular as to exact
time and dates."
SEATTLE, Oct. 4.â To obtain $20 John
O'Brien, a typical tramp, assaulted and
robbed Harry Calhoun, another vagabond,
last night. Not content with kicking him
almost into insensibility, he made an at
tempt to throw Calhoun into the bay. Un
successful in this, he placed Calhoun, who
by this time had become unconscious, on
the Northern Pacific track, where ha
would have been killed by an incoming
passenger train had he not been discov
ered and rescued in theÂ»nick of time.
O'Brien was captured shortly after his
murderous deed was committed. He was
drinking in the Anaconda saloon on
Charles street, and when brought to the
City Jail by Patrolman Humes was read
ily Identified by Calhoun. The latter pre
sented a sorry sight. He was covered
with blood and suffering from two ugly
scalp wounds, inflicted by the bootheels
of his assailant. Calhoun remembers lit
tle of the affair, but has a distinct recol
lection that after he had been knocked to
the ground his assailant picked him up
and tried to throw him Into the bay. He
resisted and the effort was finally aban
doned. Kicking him on the head several
times, O'Brien then deliberately left the
unconscious man lying across the railroad
track and made his escape.
A passerby discovered Calhoun and no
tified Patrolman Humes. The latter, aft
er some difficulty, aroused Calhoun and
obtained a meager description of his as
sailant. Later he gained another clew
and, acting upon it, entered the Anaconda
saloon, where he placed O'Brien under ar
rest. When searched O'Brien had $32 in
his pockets.

" WASHINGTON, Oct. 4.â In the
\\ \\ jf Schley court of inquiry, llr.
\\/\\/ Raynor, chief counsel for Ad-'
V W miral Schley, asked Judge
Advocate Lemly to summon
Admiral Sampson as a witness . in the
case. The request grew out of- a differ
ence in the construction of a sentence in
Admiral Sampson'-s letter to Commodore
Schley, written from Key "West, May 20,
when Commodore Schley. with the flying
squadron, lay oft Cienfuegos.
This is known as .the "Dear Schley"
letter. In it, as printed in the Navy I>e
partment documents supplied to the Sen
ate, the admiral said, after expressing
his opinion that notwithstanding the
Spanish squadron was In Santiago it was
better to contimue to blockade Cienfuegos
am Havana, and "we shall continue to
hold Havana and Santiago until we re
ceive more positive Information.
During the examination of Commanaer
Raymond P. Rodgers this dispatch was
under consideration when Mr. Raynor
expressed the opinion that the word
"Santiago" had been inadvertently used
by the commander-in-chief, assuming
that he meant to use the word Clen

Mr. Raynor asked Judgre Advocate
Lemly to make this concession, but the
latter declined to do so, saying that he
would produce the original of Admiral
Sampson's dispatch to prove that he had
written Santiago. Then Mr. Raynor saiu:
44 I cannot take that word Santiago to
mean anything but Cienfuegos. It is an
imputation on Commodore Schley and I
cannot permit it to rest without summon
ing the author of that dispatch." to
which Captain Lemly responded:
"I have told you once before you can
summon any one you wish."
"Then," retorted Mr. Raynor, ."sum
mon Admiral Sampson." - .
This occurred only a short time before
the adjournment of the court for the day
and was tho subject of more or less con

the day's work was concluded. Mr. Ray-;

on the admiral being. summoned unless
the correction was conceded.

Commander Rodgers was examined at length
concerning the coaling of the flying squadron.
"Could, you have coaled the Iowa on the
afternoon of May 28?" Mr. ! Hanna asked. ":'
"In the late afternoon," the time I speak of,
the weather being fine and I smooth, ' I think
there would have been no trouble at all," re
plied the witness.
Lieutenant Dyson was followed on tho stand
by Commander Raymond P. Rodgers, 1 who was
executive officer of the battleship Iowa during,
the summer of 1S98.' He testified to leaving
Key West, on May 20 for 'Cienfuegos, to. Join
the flying squadron. Before leaving he had.
had- as a representative of Captain Evans, he
said, a conference with â¢ Commander in Chief
Sampson, at which Captains Taylor and Chad
wick were present. At that time he was told
by Admiral Sampson that he had. received In
formation from the department at Washington
that the Spanish fleet under Cervera was pos
sibly in' the harbor of ..Santiago. . Â¦
Ho had not however, been Informed of any
secret code for communicating with the Cu
ban insurgents near Cienfuegos.- He had, â¢ ho
said, taken "dispatches for. Commodore Schley,"
and while not certain whether there was more
than one package, he was under the impres
sion there was more' than that number. One
of the dispatches carried at this time was, the
witness thought, that signed by Secretary Long
and dated Washington, 12:30 o'clock, May 20,
and beginning: "The report of the Spanish
fleet being at Santiago de Cuba might very
well be correct, so the department strongly a<l-"
vises that you send word Immediately by the
Iowa to Schley to proceed off Santiago with'
his whole command, leaving one small .vessel
off Cienfuegos." Â¦ '. . â¢;
â¢ : t Condition of the i Sea. Â¦[ -Â¦
"I do not.'-'
. The - statement showed that the Massachu
setts could not have steamed more than fif
teen knots an hour and that In doing so she
would have consumed 180 tons per day. At this
rate . she could have chased the enemy ' for
1.8 days, returning via Yucutan'- Channel, or
for two days returning via the Windward
Passage. The witness said In reply, to ques
tions that- his statement contemplated aver
age conditions of weather and of the vessels.
Mr. "Raynorâ You have taken as a base for
coaling a number of ports. You took Gonaives,
the Moles iand . Kingston. .Those are ports that
have Just been given, you from which to make
the calculation.
"These ports were Just mentioned to me here
to-day."
."You, of course, know nothing about- our
right to coal in those ports?"' _ â¢
Mr. Raynor brought out 'the information con
cerning the time the coal on each- of the ves
fcels would have lasted on forced draught, in
chasing the enemy's vessels, taking the amount
of coal on each May 26, and leaving sufficient
coal to return to Key West. Mr. Raynor read
the Information from Mr. Dyson's .tabulated
statement showing that the Iowa would have
consumed 243 tons of coal a day, the Texas 180
tons a day and tho Marblehead 77 tons. The
estimate would, he said, give the Brooklyn 2.3
days' chase returning by way of the Yucutan
Channel and 2.35 days' chase returning by the
Windward Passage; the Iowa a chase of 1.2
days. The Texas would have a chaso of three
fourths of a day and returning by way of the
Windward Passage nine-tenths of a day. The
Marblehead would have a chase of two-tenths
of a day by the Yucutan Channel and four
tenths by the Windward Passage.

rect the , official copy of his testimony. ' He
said that while he had not seen the Brooklyn
swing with starboard helm .he < was sure that
she. did so swing. Lieutenant Dyson, who was
on the witness stand yesterday when the court
adjourned, was then recalled. He had added
to his ' coal history of the fleet Information as
to how the coal supply the fleet had on hand
May- 26 would have held out .. under â¢Â¦ forced
draught. 'This information was "contained in
a chart which was read by Judge Advocate
Lemly. . Â¦
The witness also read the same Information
from a tabulated statement. The chart cov
ered the period from May 18 to June 1. It
showed that on May 20 the. Brooklyn's supply
of coal was 9C2 tons;. the Iowa, 784 tons; the
Texas, 408, and the Marblehead, 122 tons.. He
raid that on May 24 the Brooklyn had coal
enough 'aboard- to have remained on blockade
duty off Santiago for twenty-five days and
then to have returned to Key West ; the
Massachusetts enough to remain seventeen
days and ! then go to Key West; the Iowa
enough for eleven days, the Texas seven days
and the Marblehead one day. This was assum
ing that they would have gone by the- Yucatan
Channel. He also gave an estimate of the
length of time they could have remained and
gone to Gonalves Channel, Cape Cruz, Mole St.
Nicholas, Kingston, Port Antonio, Jamaica,
Guantanamo Bay, thÂ« time of remaining on
blockade being Increased as the distance to the
various points diminished.
Mr. Radnor remarked - that he supposed It
would be conceded that 'Â¦ the word "Santiago"
as given above was a mistake, and that it
should be "Clenfuegos." Captain , Lemly â¢ re
plied that he would make 'no such concession,
and a tilt followed between- counsel concern-
Ing the accuracy of Government publications.
It closed- with an understanding, that .the ori
ginal document should be supplied,. to-morrow.

"Dear Schley" Letter.
The afternoon session of the Schley court be
gan with Captain Rodfjers still on the stand.
He stated In reply to questions that he was
the senior member of the Naval Board of Sur
vey, appointed by Admiral Sampson to examine
the wrecked Spanish vessels. ' . ; .
"The purpose of this line of examination was
to bring out the witness' - knowledge concern
ing the effect of the Brooklyn's gunnery in the
battle off- Santiago July 3. Captain Rodgers
stated that the Brooklyn was the only vessel
that fired five-inch shells and Mr. Raynor said
that a careful computation, based upon the
report of the board of survey showed that
twelve five-Inch shells bad been found on the
four Spanish vessels. Â¦ i g Â¦
Â¦ Mr. . Raynor presented a . statement showing
the number of shells found on the vessels of
the Spanish fleet, and - the witness ' was asked
to state the percentage, of five- inch shells, as
suming the statement to be correct, Captain
Rodgers replied that the total number of hits
was thirty-five, and that, therefore, the flve
inch shell hits constituted 34 per cent of all
the hits. Mr. Raynor said that the statement
had been prepared by Admiral Schley. The
witness also said he knew that the Brooklyn
had eight-Inch guns, but Mr. Raynor said the
admiral's computation was not intended -to
cover that feature. His only purpose was to
make- the showing for five-inch guns," these
being unmistakably the Brooklyn's. ,
Gunnery on Brooklyn.
Captain . Rodgers related two or three in
stances in which the ships of the flying squad
ron were cleared for action upon signal from
the flagship Brooklyn before May 31, when
vessels were discerned ' in the distance.'. .- In
each case the vessels proved to be American
ships. Each time the signal was to clear to
action and make speed of twelve knots an hour.
He also told of the bombardment--or-recon
naissance of the Cristobal Colon on May 31.
in which the Iowa participated. He said the
vessels were all in formation and following
tho flagship, which, 'in that Instance,; was the
Massachusetts. The range was at first given
as 7000 'yards for this engagement, but the
shots fell bo far short. that the range was in
creased to 11,000 yards. These latter shots fell
Into the chanrielin which the Colon lay. Some
of them must have fallen with 2500 yards of
the Spanish ship.-
Describing Commodore Schley's blockade of
the harbor at Santiago, Captain Rodgers said
that the fleet " maintarned a position of seven
or eight miles out with the Marblehead and the
Vixen inside â¢ the- line. He remembered that
th Marblehead was on the Inside from the fact
that some of the vessels in the squadron had
fired at her. He could not say whether the
fleet was further out in the day than at night,
or vice versa. He thought the Vixen and the
Marblehead could have been seen by moon
light, but not after the moon had set.
Captain Kodgers had concluded his testimony
In chief when the court adjourned for luncheon.

The court asked a number of questions of
Commander Itodgers, the most important of
which, together with the responses of- the
witness, were as follows: *â¢
By the court â was any other attempt made
by the flying squadron, except that of May 31,
to destroy the Colon? V
"None whatever to the best of my
knowledge and belief."
"What was the speed of the Iowa when
passing the harbor of Santiago on the 31st of
May?"
"We were directed to speed ten knots, and
I should say that on the first run by we were
making about that speed."
"Were the Brooklyn and Texas so close to
gether at the commencement of the battle of
July 3 that a" collision was likely?"
"I caw the Brooklyn and Texas at the be
ginning of the battle. The Brooklyn was then
lying a mile or more away from the Iowa,
bearing the general direction westward. The
Texas was between the Iowa and the Brook
lyn" and the Texas was not more than half
a mile from us. .When .the Iowa steamed in
the Texas was under our port bow. and the
Brooklyn, as I saw her then, .was steaming
in the direction general northeast.
â¢ "Shortly after that the fire begaln to get a
little hot. We were struck twice and the car
penter came to me and said there had- been a
fire in one of the compartments. ,1 went down
to that compartment to see what had been
done, and if the court refers to the possibility
of a collision ' between the Texas and the
Brooklyn, that must have occurred while I was
below, because when I came back to the gal
lery outside the conning tower, the Brooklyn
was 'then off our port bew some distance from
us, steaming in a westward . direction."
"Did Commodore Schley open In your pres
ence the package you . handed him at Clep.

is "To the best of my recollection, yes.'.'
. "Did he make any comment to you regurd
lng these dispatches I"
Â¦ "Not that I recall.' Ho discussed or stated
the conditions "existing there. This waÂ» never

"Can you from your conversation with Com
modore Schley designate the dispatch he re
ceived?" .-.-â¢â¢ : - .
"I cannot."- . Â¦
At this point Commander Rodgers waa excused
and Judge Advocate Lemly, after stating that
Lieutenant Commander Hodgson would be the
next witness, pending his appearance again
brought up the question as to whether the word
"Santiago" had been substituted by mistake
for the word "Clenfuegos" in the letter written
by Admiral Sampson to Commodore Schley. on
May 20. beginning "Dear, SchleyV' Captain
Lemly said:. Â¦-.â¢ .V . .
Controversy. Over I*etter.
"The word , was orieinally 'Santiago' as It is
printed in the Senate document. The difference
appears to be a matter of punctuation, and in
the- letter.' as it appears copied In Admiral
Sampson's copy-book, it reads 'until we then
receive more positive information we shall con
tinue to hold Havana and Santiago.'- The word
'then' in the letter as printed refers back to
other matters relating to Santiago, ! and the
punctuation would appear to give It the mean
ing of, therefore, "until we therefore receive,"
which is not intended, but it means really 'until
we then,' after the arrival of Cervera at San
tiago, 'receive . further information,' etc. â¢ The
original however, will still be -forthcoming."
Mr. Raynor, | after securing Captain Lenity's
permission, read two or three sentences from
Admiral Sampson's letter as follows:
"Please send Scorpion to communicate with
those vessels at Santiago and direct one of them
to report to the department from St. Nicholas
Mole or - Cape Haytien. ' The change which I
have made in the plans strongly advised by the
department. Â¦ As soon as | this vessel has com
municated-with the department on her return
to the vicinity of . Santiago, learn the condi
tion of affairs and at once report at Havana or
Clenfuegos, as he may think most advantage
ous." . ' ' -, -
"This," said he, "I want to call to the at
tention of the. Judge advocate." - ';.-.;
Mr. Raynor . continued : "I cannot take that
word- 'Santiago' to '. mean anything else but
'Clenfuegos.' It cannot possibly mean anything
else. It la an imputation 'upon Commodore
Schley and I cannot permit that imputation to
rest without summoning the author of that le-
Quest."
When the ' colloquy In regard to Admiral
Sampson's disnatch closed for the time Com
mander. Hodgson took the oath. He said he
had been the navigator of Commodore Schley's
flagship, the Brooklyn, during the war with
Spain and was on the bridge on the day of
the battle of July 3. Detailing the paiticulaH
of the engagement,' he said: "I heard the ex
ecutive officer. Lieutenant Commander Mason
sing out: 'Clear ship for action,' and th& crew
lmmedlately dispersed ' to quarters, I bavins
sounded the general alarm previously. The
commodore shortly appeared on the bridge. We
were at that time headed about west-northwest.
I told him that there was nothing doing, and
he said 'Go ahead.' I rang six bells and asked
if- he had not better hold her head steady to
see what course the Spaniards proposed to pur
sue. I do not remember his reply exactly to
that, because immediately afterward r told
him they were evidently making for us, and
he said: â¢ 'Go for them,' and I rang four bells
and put the helm aport.
Commodore on I>eck.
"Captain Cook appeared on the bridge at this
time and I told him that everything was con
nected up at the conning tower, and that we
were ready to go ahead, and in fact we were
going ahead. The commodore took his posi
tion on a platform he had had built around
the conning tower where he could be in easy
communication . with the commanding officer
inside, and I remained on the bridge.
"The executive officer had given previously
the order to mam the starboard batteries I
sang out to him we were going into action
with port helm, and he shifted over to the
port battery. We were then standing for the
enemy, and as the guns were brought to bear
Lieutenant Simpson fired & little off the port
bow the first gun In the forward eight-inch
tunx*. From that time on.we went consider
ably in toward them.
"r went down to where the commodore was
standing to get Into the conning tower, when
I heard him sing out, 'Lrfjok out. Cook, they- are
going to ram you.'
''Captain Cook said he would look after that
and starboarded the helm a little to parallel
the course of the leading vessel, the Maria
Teresa, which had made" a broad sheer to port
He had hardly made that sneer, however to
port before he fell off again, for.tha reason
apparently, that a shot was fired from the'
Brooklyn's eight-inch gun. The Teresa got
abaft our port beam and the helm was ported
on the Broklyn immediately after. We were
swinging with port helm. I heard the commo
dore sing out: 'Hard aport,'. or words to that
effect, and Captain Cook sang out. 'Helm is
aport.' I saw at that time the crucial mo
ment had c#me in making the turn and I
suggested to the . commodore that that turn
would run us into the Texas or close to her"
"What did you say and what was the re
ply T' asked the judge advocate.
"As near as I can recall I said: 'Commodore,
If you go to the starboard you Â¦ will run Into
the Texas,' and he said, 'Damn the Texas, 1
cannot help that. She must look out for her
self. He will take care of that,' and he also
said, 'I don't -propose to go In any closer and
subject myself to a torpedo attack.'
"I suggested : then that we back the star
board engine, and he wanted to know why
and I said 'because it would give the Texas a
wider - berth and shorten our turning 1 circle *
Captain Cook objected to this and so did the
commodore, but there was a moment's discus
sion as to whether it would be better to turn
a smaller circle with less speed or take the
larger tactical diameter with faster speed.' It
was decided that it was very essential to get
around quickly, as the leading Spanish shin
was then standing. to the westward and If the
Brooklyn did not stop her she had a' good
chance of escaping. So the helm was put hard

SCHLEY TO BETISE WEDNESDAY
Aflmiral Schley returns thanks for the denial
furnished, adding, touching the colloquy, "your
statement that It never occurred Is absolutely
true."
Under date cf "VTashington, Junn 10, 1893,
Admiral Schley. disclaiming any sense of an
noyance from the newspapers' comment*, save:
"But I do feel for yourself that a colloquy
should be made up by them that did not occur
between you and me, and it -fr this that I
desire to protect you against. Of course, you
did not authorize this, and it Is this dialogue
â¢which should be denied. I have no recollec
tion whatever of anything- of the kind, and
my etory is exceedingly clear of the events
cf that day, for I never felt In my life less
excitement or more steadiness of Judgment
than when the Dons came out that day. When
the turn was made the Brooklyn was, In my
Judgment, within the distance of their tactical
diameter, and if it had been made to port
we should have passed Inside their line, but
having them <xi>osea to the Interrupted flre
of ail the sh!pa, Â»o Important in the earlier
moments in the fight, the proper strategy of
& battle "was to avoid Interfering with that,
ar.d the sequel shows that we made no mls
t&k%. Cook really gave the order, which I
Approved, and .it Is possible that your con
versation was with him, but the Sun's effort
has been to promote the notion that you and
I had a controversy at the critical moment
and this Is unjust to you and me. What 1
deÂ»Ire Is Blmply your denial that any such
colloquy occurred, anfl I win see that proper
correction Is made to cover you from this eran
der. There Is much in your letter that I
tY.mlA Jtot like to use. as it would provoke
assault upon you, which I am unwilling to
have happen, but what I want to show Is
eimplr this dialogue <lid not occur, and that
ehown, the nrjÂ»ole flimsy csnard falls to the
sreund. Make your letter short as possible"
On June U Hodgson writes: "The colloquy
published In the Sun, and alleged to have
taken place between you and me on the day
of the battle off Santiago, July 8, isss, never
occurred."
Hodgson goes on tr> declare that he was under
the impression, up to the time he saw the
New York Sun publication. !n regard to th a
colloquy, that Schley made the turn to star
board because the conditions were as he
<Hodgson) had stated. Continuing, he assures
the admiral that he -would have never given
the explanation he had cf the loop had he for
a moment suspected that the admiral had given
any other reasons /
Hodgson suggests that in making the sug
gestion he was discharging his duty as the
navigator of the i>h!p. charged with her safety,
and at the moment did not consider the effect
of the turn upon the results of the battle, and
he added: "I immediately perceived that your
cool judgment at this trying moment had en
abled you to consider the results of your de
cision, and then, as now, it seems to me that
you had decided most wisely, that It was a
strategical move of the greatest Importance
and that the result of the battle proved its
wisdom."
Hodgson writes that he then suggested back
ing the starboard engine, "because it would
shorten the circle and give the Texas a wider
berth. 11 and that Schley replied, after a pause,
"No. because It would deaden our speed of
turning, end you wish to get around as quick
as possible. For weeks alter the battle Cap
tain C<v:k was under the impression that we
had backed the starboard engine."
Then Hodgson gives his explanation of the
turn. He tells cf the belief that existed that
the Spanish ships outclassed the Americans In
speed, and that in the absence cf the New
York the Brooklyn was the only American ship
capable of preventing the escape of the Spanish
ehips should they escape the fire of the battle
chips. The Spanish torpedo-boats were also to.
be reckoned with. "Therefore," says Hodgson,
"after rutting the helm to starboard and to
port once or twice to counteract the efforts of
the Teresa and Viscaya to get Into closer
action and ram us, and after the leading Span
ish vessel had reached just a little abaft our
port beam, you decided to port the helm and
turn around in chase to prevent the escape of
any of the Spanish vessels."
Hodgson writes that he suggested that the
Texas was aft their starboard beam, and that
there was danger of running Into her and
getting right across her line of fire, and that
i~chley replied that the Texas would have to
look out for that; that it was imperative to
get around immediately, and by "turning to
port you would be so close to the enemy that
you would expose yourself to attack from the
torpedo boats, that a lucky shot or two by
the enem^ might disable the Brooklyn and
that you did not propose to run such a risk
at that stage of the battle, when it was so
unnecessary and when so much depended upon
the epeed of the Brooklyn.
Hodgson then tells cf the rage with which the
Brooklyn men heard the sinister whisper, upon
her return to Guantanarno Bay, that they were
"gun shy," and he says he gave what he
thought was a true explanation of that turn
to many officers of the fleet, none of whom
failed to agree w|th him. He explains that
Admiral Schley regarded this turn as a strat
egical maneuver, "locking- to the further part
the Brooklyn was to play in that day's battle
rather than as an effort to avoid interfering
with the fire of the other- vessels of the fleet.
In fact. I thought then, as I think now, that
the turn to starboard caused more interfer
ence."
On June 6. VSSt. Admiral Schley wrote Lieu
tenant Hodgson, inclosing an editorial from
the New York Sun, alleging that a colloquy
had occurred between Schley and Hodgson on
the bridge of the Brooklyn during the battle
of Santiago, in the course of which the admiral
is reported to have said: "Damn the Texas; let
her look out for heiself." In reply to Hodgson's
remonstrance against turning the ship to star
beard. Characterizing this as a grotesque lie,
the admiral asked Hodgson to write "your de
nial of this o:t-rcpeai.ed calumny." On June 8
Hodgson responded in a very lone letter, dated
at the New York Navy Yard, denying he au
thorized the publication of any conversation,
and making a long explanation of what he says
occurred during the battle. He added that what
was printed "as a part of a conversation be
tween you and me is substantially correct,
though not as to the manner in which it took
j>la<?e." â¢

Admiral Schley during the period from June 6,
IS??, to August 25, 19C1, were given to the press
to-day with the statement that the corre

Continued on Page Eight.
Under advisement' of the Commlsion on In
creased Responsibilities the board of managers
has made some progress, slight and slow, in
regard to the ministrations of this church in
Porto Rico and the "Philippine Islands. The
Bishop of Shanghai, as Bishop in charge of the
Philippine : Islands, has made one visitation,
and all missionary -appointments and mission
ary arrangements arc under his direction, v
'Aqtion has been taken by the board of man
agers upon various matters referred to it by
the board of missions in 1893. as follows:
The board of missions ureed .the managers
to appropriate $70,000 for the work among the
colored people. The resolution was * considered,'
but the board found Itself unable at the begin
ning of the triennial period to enlarse its
former appropriation of $56,800. â¢ But later on
It' did â¢ appropriate $62,000. and still later, Â¦ in
1900, added $1200 from the Woman's Auxiliary
United Â¦ Offering Â¦ for Women Workers, and
$10,000 divided equally between St. Augustine's,
Raleigh, 'and Bt. Paul's School, Lawrenceville;
so that the total appropriation' for the last
year for work among the colored people was
$78,200. ."'-.. Â¦ â¢' . . .,Â¦:_-. ,. Â¦ ,. - .. Â¦ ;
The. membership of the board of managers
during the last, year has been, changed,! the
Rev. Heman Dyer, D.D., . the Rev. John:Wes

having died and Mr. Bache McJEvers Whltlock

Rev. Ernent â¢ M. r Stlres," D.D., Rev. Randolph

death of the Bishop of. Long Island, one of
the oldest . and most devoted members of the
board. The . deaths within the year of the
Bishop coadjutor of Springfield, the Bishop of

Resolved, That. the board do further report
to the General Convention that in its judgment
the meager attendance of. elected Â¦. members at
recent missionary councils warrants the con
clusion that more general Â¦ Interest should be
aroused Â¦â¢ ln v the council, and also more carÂ«
exercised in the election of members who can
and will attend arid that better reports be

the amendment to Title III. Canon VII, Arti

sionary Council, â¢ is not desirable or expedient.
Resolved, That the board of managers to
whom an amendment to Title III, Canon VII
Article IV. was ref.rred by the. General Con*
vention of 1888. do report to the said General
Convention that , in its Judgment said amend
ment Is at present Inexpedient. . . â¢
The whole subject of the missionary council
was referred by the General Convention at its
last session to the board of. managers to re
port at this session. Two points were specially
under consideration: One, from the missionary
council of 1900, suggesting the" provision for
an annual missionary council in each diocese;
the other, a Joint resolution from the last Gen
eral Convention proposing to hold missionary
councils annually in each of four division* of
the whole territory of the United States.' But
the board failed to see Its way to recommend
either of these changes and reports to the
General Convention the following resolutions
as the result ot its consideration of the sub
ject: Â¦ ... Â¦â¢ â¢
ask, what certainly is only the most scant
consideration, and the smallest courtesy, that
they be read and pondered by the church.
Charged by the General Convention and by
the board of missions, meeting three years ago,
to consider and report , upon several subjects
referenced, to them, the mar.agers add the fol
lowing statement of action taken or propo?ed:
th!s responsibility really rests the women and
the children are thoroughly roused and in
earnest, and what remains and seems most
needful Is that the men -should be stirred. Â¦Â¦
If they felt the game corporate Â¦ spirit, the
same â¢ corporate enthusiasm, the same corpo
rate responsibility that the. children of the
Sunday-schools feel, the, ' whole missionary situ
ation might be transformed in a decade. Be
sides the hundred thousands - from . the mite
boxes, there would be millions from the banks.
The organized work of the . Sunday-schools,
under, the inspiration . of the treasurer of the
board, and through the energetic capacity of
the Rev. Dr. Duhring, which in 1900 gave
$97,000, has surpassed itself this -year and
given. over $104,000 from 3467 schools. \ .
With regard to missions in foreign countries
the board met' the estimates . from-the Bishops
without diminution, and the total of all ap
propriations for the fiscal year 1901-2 has been
announced to the church as $610,000, subject to
slight increase to meet special opportunities or
emergencies during the year. But at this very
time, the meeting ln May, the outlook for
closing the present fiscal year without arrear
age was most unpromising. It then appeared
that there would be a deficit on Aujruat 3J. of
at least $100,000. The board, therefore, felt
compelled to qualify its action making the ap
propriations by the adoption of the following
resolution: * â¢ Â¦
Resolved, That, ln case the ' contributions
leg-acies and Interest from trust funds for the
year , ending September â¢ 1, . 1901, shall fall to
meet the appropriations for the same period
and, provided that said deficit at the close of
the year shall be found to be not less than
one hundred thousand ; dollars ($100,000), ' a re.
duct ion at . the rate . of 10 per cent on all ap-

BEADS LONG REPORT
The Bishop of Albany then presented
the triennial report of the board of man
agers to the Board of Missions relating to
the domestic and foreign missions of the
Episcopal church.
The distinguished prelate charmed all
present by his fluent and pleasing style
of speech, and. though the report read
was a very long one, it was listened to
with the greatest interest. The Bishop's
voice could be heard in every portion of
the church, despite the poor acoustic
properties of the edifice. â¢
The report of the board of managers, as
read by Bishop Doane of Albany, was in
part as follows:
Surrendering into the hands of the General
Convention the position of honor and responsi
bility which they received three years ago. the
board cf iranafcrs present the report which
the cannon requires, comprising an outline of
the "missionary work prosecuted during the
preceding year In order to give a comprehen-
Flve view cf the progress, prospects and pres
ent condition of the work of the society "
There are three gradations of the. missionary
Bishop Potter cf New York moved to
amend the report by substituting the
word ' evening 7 ' for "afternoon," in order
to have the scheduled afternoon sessions
take place in the evening. The amend
ment of Bishop Potter was carried and
the amended report was also adopted.

ever, took seats with their delegations,
Bishop Potter of New York sitting next
to J. Pierpont Morgan and Bayard Cut

Bishop Tuttle of Missouri, the senior
Bishop present in order of consecration,
cccuplea the chair and called the board
to order. Bishop Doane of Albany and
the Lcrd Bishop of Newcastle took seats
next to the presiding officer.
The Bishop cf Connecticut, chairman of
the committee on the order of business
then read the outline of the programme
of the proceedings to be carried out by
the board during Its sessions. The pro
gramme is published in the diary of the
convention issued by the local press com
mittee, ana has already appeared in this
paper.
The reports from the African mission have
in them much encouragement In the prosper
ous condition of the school* and stations and
the record of thorough visitations from the
Bishop. The work under the supervision of
the board of managers . in our own enormous
land covers at once the missionary districts
and the dioceses, in which missionaries are
maintained, in part, by stipends from our gen
eral offerings.
From every hand the news comes back of
earnest enthusiasm, pushing and pressing the
Turning to our foreign work, the great tri
umphs of this last year have been won In
China. The Biehop of Shanghai, with a wise
courape and a fearless prudence, faced and
met the threatenings of danger, withdrawing
the workers from certain points and watching
the opportunities for their return. In the good
providence of God, no personal harm was done
to any of our missionaries. The story of the
other work abroad is marked with similar
tokens or God's blessing. Along quieter ways
and in more peaceful times, the .church in
Japan, with Its added' missionary district of
Kyoto and its new Bishop, is winning its
we,v to th# cinndence of the people.
SPREAD OF MISSIONS
UU FAR-OFF IJANDS
The managers are not disposed to raise the
vexed question of. what some people are In
: clined to count Intrusion, into countries
; claimed by the Roman communion as owing
allegiance to the Bishop of Rome. The policy
of this church Is plainly and positively settled
now. it takes In the oversight of the strug
gling native church of Mexico, ths mission
planted In the island of Cuba, and more re
cently, the sending of priests to Porto, Rico
and Manila to preach the pure gospel, to ad
minister the sacramenta on the primitive
terms of communion and to set the example
of a higher morality In the priesthood and
among the people. The church owes her high
est commendation to the army chaplains sta
tioned in Porto Rico and the Philippines for
their untiring devotion.
Of the progress of the work, so far as this
means entrance into new fields, mention may be
made first of the sending of missionaries into
the new territories acquired by, or brought into
relation with, this Government. There are and
were American citizens and churchmen in the
army and in the offices of Government, to
whom for awhile our chaplains ministered and
who have a rightful claim upon us for the
ministrations of the church. And especially In
the Philippine Islands, the services held by the
chaplain soon attracted the attention of the
native people, to whom the yoke of Roman op
pression, with Us unauthorized, terms of com
munion, and its association with the tyranny
cf some of the religious orders, had become a
bondage which neither "their fathers nor they
were able to bear."
To that great corporate body, through you,
the managers bring their report, whose details
of service, of business administration, of finan
cial accounting, are appended ; a report of the
progress, prospects and present condition of
the missionary work.
and Foreign Missionary Society Is the church
In America.
The scope of the Board of Missions is a vast one, dealing as it does with the mis
sionary work of the church at home and abroad. The report of the board of managers was pre
sented at the meeting and the statements of the treasurer were also received. While the contribu
tions from the members of the dioceses were very large they zuere not sufficient to cover the expenses
of the mission zvork and the reserve fund was drawn upon.
A rousing speech by George C. Thomas, treasurer of the funds of the mission board, was the
feature of yesterday's proceedings and resulted in pledges being made for $10,000 toward the re
serve fund. T}ie names of the gentlemen who will make the donations were kept secret.
The House of Bislwps held a short session yesterday and the House of Deputies transacted
considerable business. The missionary exhibition of the Woman's Auxiliary zuas opened and ser
vices zuere held by the Daughters of the King. A service was also held in the evening at Trinity
Church. .. ,

BANKER MORGAN MAKES
HIS INITIAL SPEECH
J. Pierpont Morgan of New York made
his first appearance in the convention pro
ceedings as a speaker by presenting the
following resolution:
Resolved, the House of Bishops concurring,
That a committee of five be appointed to act
with a similar 1 committee of the House of
Bishops on the selection pf the place of meet
ing for the Joint convention of 19(M.
The resolution was duly adopted.
The delegation from Indiana presented
a resolution asking that the name of its
diocese be changed. The resolution was
placed on the calendar. ; Rev.- Dr. Daven
port of Rhode Island, in reporting for the
committee on marriage and divorce, pre
sented a resolution which was adopted.
The resolution is as follows;
In respect to the canon on marriage and di
vorce, as several members of that committee of
the house are also members of the commission
of both houses, in order to save the time of
making separate -notions in this house and tak
ing up your time about it. I will move that the
house committee on marriage and divorce have
leave to sit with the revision whenever it may
deem mutual action by these committees neces
sary.
Rev. Dr. Fulton of Philadelphia- then
addressed the house. â¢ In part. he said: ,
I have two resolutions, -or rather Inquiries, to
be addressed to two of our principal commit
teesâone the committee on the Book of Common
Prayer and the other, the committee on amend
ments to the constitution. We are within a
short time to take into consideration the valu
able report on marginal readings, in connection
with which I think a very Important question
requires to be cleared up. It has been assumed
and apparently not considered that we'are free
to adopt the action taken yesterday by another
house under the constitution. I respectfully
question our power to act in that manner, and In
order to save the intrusion of a long debate upon
our constitutional competency I desire to pre
sent these two serious inquiriesâ one to the
committee on the Book of Common Prayer and
the other to the committee on amendment to

months beginning December 1, 1901.
The entire . recelsts of the society for the
fiscal year ended August 31 . were $998,904 47.
This, sum includes the large receipts for
"."specials" and those for publications and mis
cellaneous purposes, which do not aid the board
in meeting its appropriations.'
The cost of administerinc the affairs of the
society and of making the work known to the
church was seven and seven-tenths per cent of
the receipts for missions, or six and six-tenths
per cent of the gross amount which passed
through the treasury, including, as before said,
subscriptions to the stated publications and
money received for miscellaneous purposes.
The number, of parishes and missions which,
contributed to the work of the society by any
agency is 4075 (but of these only 1993 sent offer
ings taken at church services). -For the year
ended August 31, 1900, 3963 contributed.

The total amount at . the discretion of .the
board for the work for which it made itself
responsible was $526,557 50, of which $456,864 32
came from contributions Â¦ and $69,633 18 from
legacies received during the year and $45SO from
legacies unused, received . the . previous year;
these legacies having been ' designated, by the
testators either for domestic or foreign mis

stopped the proceedings in order that
noonday prayer: might be held. On re
suming, business a . report was 1 read by
Rev. Dr. Lloyd, the general secretary of
the Board of. Missions. The report dealt
with the. scope of: the mission work and
the conditions and /obstacles under, which
the- missionary board was compelled- to
suffer. The report reviewed at length the
work of -.the past three years and pointed
out that urgent and immediate steps must
be taken to secure the funds necessary to
maintain the work of the Boara of Mis
sions of-, the church. The report; of the
Ex-Governor Prince of New Mexico
moved that the report be referred to a
committee consisting of three ..Bishops,
three presbyters and three laymen," which
was done by a unanimous vote. The re
ports of the Woman's Auxiliary and the

previously received, were referred to com

conditions 'bravely and hopefully. Discourage
ment and difficulty are not excuses for down
heartedness and despair. Their manly use is
to rouse to greater effort and more determined
purpose. If any "more excellent way" can be
found than that which the present constitution
of the society provides let the wisest men find
it and present it to the church. The "wheels"
must be well and carefully constructed, but
the matter of essential Importance is that, the
"spirit of the living creature shall be in them."
Underneath' all this is the need to rouse and
stir the church to its duty and its opportunity,
and the motives to this must be hope and con
fidence, and not timid anxiety and alarm; con
fidence that shall not take the form of self
complacency, and hope t that makes dissatis

to do greater things. , Â¦ . -.
But a word, of personal explanation first.
You . may ; think it rather strange that the
tieasurer of Â¦ the board should reside In an
other city, from where the offices of the board
are. It was a very unexpected thing to me
when the matter was suggested, but after con
sidering it and taking it tentatively for a short
time I came to the conclusion that I could
direct the affairs . of the financial operations
of the society where I lived, with constant and
dally communication iover the' telephone and
with occasional visits to the offices, almost as
well as if I resided In the city of New York,
and hence I accepted = the Â¦ position regularly

'mlrably and clearly some of the points that
I expected to make in regard to the financial
condition.^ I am glad that he did so becaus.;
he is my chief officer. I serve under him most
gladly and willingly. .
The most stirring speech of the conven
tion was made by George C. Thomas, the
partner of J. Plerpont Morgan. Mr.
Thomas is the treasurer of the funds of
the Board; of ; Missions, and in presenting
his report he spoke, with earnestness and
force. Hl3 remarks were frequently in
terrupted by suppressed, applause, but at
the close of his speech he was applauded
for fully two minutes. . -

advisable to use' note paper; of fair qual

never be omitted from a business letter.

erasure upon a whole sheet of paper.
Never send a communication, no matter

THE BRIDE CAKE-E. M. A., City.
The origin of tho bride cake is said to be
Scandinavian. In that country the
groom's -mother met the newly married
couple at the door arid broke a cake of
bread over the bride's head to signify that
she would be expected to make the bread
thereafter for herslf. Following the cake
breaking the.. young. man's mother would
place the tongs, poker and shovel from
the fireplace and a new 'broom in the
hands of the bride as symbols of her
household duties. The broken cake was
Â¦carefully picked up and divided among the
unmarried girls, who would, place places
of It. under their' pillows so 'they might
dream of their future husbands. The
present custom ot cutting and distributing
the bride's cake is derived from this cere
mony pt long ago. Â¦ . . - , Â¦Â¦Â¦_ Â¦;

WORKS OF ARTâ Subscriber, City.
There is a provision of the city charter
which says that "hereafter no work of
art shall become the property of the
city and county of San Francisco by
purchase, gift or otherwise Unless such
work of art or design of the same, to
gether, with a statement of the proposed
location of such work of art, shall first
have been submitted to and approved by
the Park Commissioners."
WITH one accord the American people will
shout their applause over the triumph of
the fleet defender of the America's cup. It
is- "Hail, Columbia, the queen of all yachts and the
gem of the ocean." The victory is ours, and it is a
victory- to be proud of, for it was Avon over a yacht
that .probably could not have been beaten by any
other yacht in the world.
Whatever doubts may have existed concerning the
wisdom of the >?ew York Yacht Club managers in
deciding to make the race with the Columbia instead
of the newly constructed Constitution have been dis
sipated by the event The Columbia has proven her
self superior to her rival on every test required by
the racing rules and under every condition that the
â¢winds imposed. She wins the match in three straight
heats, and though the margin of success was always
dose it was sufficient The best that the British
could do in light winds or in strong winds was never
enough to beat the stanch American defender/ \
From first to last xi has been a singularly close
contest It is declared by the spectators to have been
the finest series of yacht races- ever witnessed.
Something, of course, is to be allowed in such
declarations for the natural exaggeration of excite
ment and enthusiasm, and yet, judging by the re
ports and -the closeness of the finish in each match,
it is not easy to see hew it could ever have been ex
ceeded in those elements* of a" good -contest, f It is
probable, therefore, that the match marks the record
of yacht-racing for many a year to come. The cen
tury begins by setting a mark that will be hard -to
pass.
It will be noted that nearly all the estimates of the
experts were wrong. The Shamrock excelled the
Columbia in just those points where it \vas thought
she would be inferior, and fell below the American
yacht where it was believed she would be the su
perior. Therefore there were a good many surprises
in the match for those who were most certain that
they knew it all. It is evident that in yachts as well
as in other things there are excellences or defects of
which ever, experts "can't most always sometimes
tell," and that in races between two yachts that are
well matched there are' lots of chances for the unex
pected to happen.
. Credit is due to the captains and the crews who
handled the rival yachts as well as to the men who
built them. The skill and seamanship displayed on
both sides have merited and received the commen
dation of all who witnessed the race and are capable
of judging. The whole affair, therefore, has been ; a
pleasant cne. Close as the issue was at all times,
there is to be no complaint from the losing party.
The Shamrock lost the race, but she has lost nothing
of honor for her builder, her captain, her crew or
her owner. The only defect in the whole thing is the
unsatisfactory sort of winds that blow at this season
around New York harbor. If the two yachts could
have had a chance to try conclusions off San Fran
, cisco there would have been a race worth erecting
a monument to.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Young Martin boqucfethed his entire es
tate to his wife, and in due course of time
she came into possession of this inherit
ance. Later the young widow went to
Japan, then through Russia and on to
London, where she has been spending
some months. Her immediate relatives in
thisA-ity are not Inclined- to discuss her
second marriage and profess Ignorance as
to the identity of Robinson Riley.
A lovely residence was taken at Palm
Springs and there the honeymoon ended
with the death of the groom seven weeks
after the marriage. His mother. Mrs.
Eleanor Martin, was in Los Angeles at
the time and accompanied her widowed
daughter-in-law to this city with the re
mains.
The announcement of the engagement
was quickly followed by the marriage. On
September 26, 1S99, the Very Rev. Father
Prendergast, V. G., performed the cere
mony at the residence of the bride. The
groom arose from a s=fck bed. and the
honeymoon trip, was taken to the southern
I-art of the State, where it was hoped the
climate would soon restore him to Health.
PRIVATE dispatches from London to
her brother, Frank Goad, and oth
i era immediately interested - an
x nounccd yesterday that Mrs. An
drew D. Martin, formerly Miss
Genevieve Goad, had been married to
Robinson Rilsy of Washington. . No one
here knew of the engagement, and specu
lation is rife as to the identity of the
groom. Some people'say his name is Riley
Robinson.
â¢ When ,the announcement was made in
August, 1899, of the engagement of Miss
Goad to Andrew Donahue .Martin it was
thought to be the forerunner of the hap
py union of two old and wealthy families.
It was known that young Martin was rich
and Miss Goad enjoyed a large share of
the property accumulated, by her father,
W. F. Goad, in the practice of the legal
profession. . .

creasing clearness of vision the indignation of the public against the inflammatory sheets
widens, deepens; and augments'. Many persons, many clubs, many organizations and
many newspapers that did not condemn Hearst at first have joined in his condemnation

advertising patronage began to fall off, it evidently- became irattiled^d commenced to

The Montana Sunday Record says: "It will take more than a few crocodile tears
to secure the 'further forbearance of decent people for these disreputable and un-American
sheets. The American pedple enduredAthese vile cartoons an<^ despicable attacks upon
the President and other public men -as they .have erfthired the presence of gangs of an
archists so long as they did not appreciate, the harm^they 'were- doing and the dangers
they threatened. Now they have'seen through the awful calamity at Buffalo the results
of such forbearance., such abuses # and dangers will-no longer be tolerated."
The Philadelphia Inquirer says: "Throughout the land the cry has gone up 'Pun
ish anarchy and yellow journalism?. Anarchy is violence itself, but . yellow journalism in
cites to violence. When dealing with the '' subject *both must be considered. The yellow
journal of trie day is a menace to" life and. property and some way ought to be found to
couple it with anarchy and stariip them both: out" â¢Â¦ ? s â¢.;'
The Springfield Union Says':.. is the remedy? It lies i simply and solely in the
hands of the people, and is not tp: be found in the resort to the lawâ no:more toleration
for that yellowism and anarchism; which breed assassination/'
The Call Of Paterson, N. J., where exists one of the largest groups of anarchists in
America, and where the nature of thai, criminal class is well understood, says: "We have
already made reference to the fact that the New York yellow journals are responsible more
than any other one thing foe the spread of anarchistic sentiments. The Journal lives and
thrives on catering tu the anarchistic class/ What paper has done more to array the poor
against the wealthy? .What other paper has done anything like as much in the way
of libeling President McKinley and other prominent officials."
The Chicago Journal says: "Not since McKinley's first inauguration has William
JR. Hearst suffered one respectful utterance, one decent remark to be made in the papers he
has controlled, concerning the President or concerning any other gentleman connected
with the administration. He has done his best and used his vast fortune .to bring the
President into contempt and make him a reproach to the people who exalted him. Bv
means of his wealth-^a wealth which he himself could never have acquiredâ Hearst has
been able to purchase the talent and ability that with pen and pencil have thus showered
vilification and abusi; upon the chief magistrate of the nation â the man whom the
world honors, but whom Hearst does not honor or respect. In addition to this Hearst
daily foments strife among the people, stirring up envy, hatred, malice and all uncharitable
ness in one class against another. Is it strange then that in the public he has sought
to educate and to sway, men are to be found who are capable of assassination, men who
would consider it their duty to kill such 'a man as Hearst has taught them to believe Mc-
Kinley was?"
The Boston Commercial Bulletin says: "Of all the men who are consciously or un
consciously responsible for this terrible decadence in public morals, one stands pre-emi
nent. William R. Hearst has kept artists busy portraying President McKinley and his
administration as the willing tools of brujtal trusts, the oppressors and murderers of the
poor. * * . * The connection between these papers ami the assault on the President
may be indirect. Such, however, has not always been the case. In Colorado, in Illinois,
in Indiana and in New York the present President was personally assaulted by men of the
opposite party. In all cases, however, words suggested by the New York Journal or the
Giicago American were in the mouths of the mob."
JThe Wilkesbarre Leader says: "There is. a, phase of the yellow and sensational
journal question that is not generally considered .; That is the reason for their existence.
What do they feed upon? By whom are theyÂ£suppjrted?, Surely if they were not sup
ported they would not exist. If they were nqttfed and well fed they could not live. Everv
individual that buys them is in a measure responsible for their existence and likewise for
their influence." ' Â¦'-. 'Â¦',. .
The New Yorker says: "If anything were needed to fill the public with loathing for
William R. Hearst and his vile newspapers.it is the^ exhibition of abject and pitiful coward:
ice since the bullets .cf one of his pupils struck -down the President- From an- attitude of
brazen effrontery, a poor imitation of fiery .^independence, his newspapers have changed to
cringing, crying hypocrisy. They are down on â¢their" marrowbones begging for * their
lives while Hearst himself is in hiding, skulking, sonievvhere under an assumed name,
airaid-to show himself among honest meii.Thepublic condemnation upon him has been
swift and terrible. * * * But that is L not7enough. His newspapers must fall under
the same withering curse that is pursuing him,thepoor fool who created them. They too
must be driven into cellars and sewers. There .rmistjje no room for them among self-re
specting Americans. The people are showing their' abhorrence of the Hearst newspapers
to an extent that is sending them back upon his hands by the carload." ; " â¢
The Stockton Independent says: "It has been concluded that publications un
friendly to our government and its institutions, unfriendly to law and order and defiant
of truth and decency and authority, must be suppressed.-- It is not proposed that laws
shall be changed to effect this, but that it shall be accomplished by a unity of moral forces
The people willapply the samejdoctrine to these journals in their daily existence as Cleve
land applied when he refused td, be used'to advertise :Hearst's" journals when the Maine
was sunk. Ex-President Cleveland has set the example and pointedthe way. Henceforth
the men of whatever reputation 'or station in life who consent. to contribute to the Exami
ner or submit to an interview; for.its columns on a public question will be subject to sus
picion as- willing to seek" publicity through contemptible channels." ' .
The r SyraCUSe Journal says: "The time has come as is. evident when a halt. must
be called. Yellow journalism ;rnust be restricted. if the lives of our. Presidents are to be
preserved. The holding up of the chief magistrate to -public contempt, the portrayal
of him as a member of a conspiracy organized for the purpose of destroying the welfare of
the laboring man, the criminal and dastardly excitation of weak-minded cranks and mar
plots â all this must stop. .. Â» Â¦ cvU^W V : :

THE following deadly editorial appeared in
Hearst' s New York Evening Journal on
May 22, 1901, less than six months be-
fore President McKinley was shot down
by a pupil of yellow journalism:
"What is an anarchist?"
"According to accepted definitions, issued
by the higher classes of society, an anarch-
ist is one who tries to do something useful
that has never been done before.-
"There Â¦ is a change coming some day,
whether .the gentlemen who denounce char-
ity as anarchy want the change or not."
WHAT IS AN ANARCHIST?
IN connection with the recent assassina-
tion of President McKinley will the Exam-
iner please tell what it meant when on
February 4, -1900, "it published, from its
Washington correspondent, the following:
"The bullet that pierced Goebers chest
Cannot be found in all the West;
Good reason. It is speeding here
To stretch McKinley on his bier."

The defense will put on as witnesses
next week Dr. H. N. Rowell of Berkeley,
who attended Adams, and Dr. C. A.
Hatch, Â©resident of the State Board of
Lunacy Commissioners.
District Attorney Allen did not secure
any new facts. The day ended with the
announcement of Judge Melvin that the
case would be continued until Monday,
when Miss Adams will be further exam
ined.
"I think he was insane. I think a man
In his condition qeuld not have been re
sponsible for his acts."
After Miss Adams had testified that her
father's uncle had been an inmate of an
asylum in South Carolina and had an
swered Juror White that Dr. Jessup threw
off his coat after he had been warned by
Adams, Miss Adams was turned over to
the prosecution for cross-examination.
"The next morning I went to father's
rocm and found him asleep. There was
a revolver on the table, which I Intended
to put away, but my attention was called
to something else and I didn't do it. He
came down to breakfast in his night
clothes. I stayed in the house until 3
o'clock, Â¦when I went out. That was the
last I saw of him before the shooting."
"From your observation of your father,
state whether or not you think that at
the time of this shooting he was insane."
"State what occurred on the Saturday
night before the shooting."
"Father complained that I had not given
him anything to eat and he was so dis
agreeable that I Went out of the house.
He was delirious then. He followed me
and I watched him from a distance. He
got down on his hands and knees and
crawled along the fence; striking matches
as he went. -I thought he would set fire
to the house. He rolled himself under the
fence, then back again, then crawled into
the house. I saw him taking drinks from
a demijohn while he was in his room.
"Yes; on two occasions. One of these
was three weeks before the shooting; the
other was the Saturday before the shoot
ing. On each occasion Dr. Rowell was
called ln to treat him."
"Yes; he was continuously under the in
fluence of liquor. I don't think he saw
two sober days."
"During that period did ' he have any
more attacks of delirium tremens?"
In reply to the questions of Attorney
Church, Miss Adams said that after leav
ing Hanford. she went with her father to
Ban Francisco, where they stayed several
months. Then thej' came to BerKeley and
he preached In an Oakland Episcopal
church for a short time. He continued
his drinking bouts almost without cessa
tion until the early part of the present
year, when he remained sober for a pe
riod of two months. .
"Did your father begin drinking again
In March?" was asked of Miss. Adams.
"Yes; he drank very much."
"From the expiration* of that period of
sobriety up to the time of the shooting
did he drink to excess?"
Charles G. Adams, the defendant, ap
peared In court this morning in a state
of partial, paralysis. His right shoulder
was drawn up and his right leg Â¦was al
most riffid. He moved about with diffi
culty and depended on the court bailiff to
assist him to and from the County Jail,
where he 1b confined. Adams said he had
been stricken during the night. He said
he had been a victim of several such at
tacks and would recover. Miss Adams
Bhowed her anxiety over her father's con
dition and gave him assistance. .
Miss Adams on the Stand.
After a respite extending from noon yes
terday Miss Agnes S. Adama was called
to the witness chair again to-day in Judge
Melvin's court to take up the thread of
her father's life story and bring it down
to the night of the shooting of Dr. John
Q. Jessup in Berkeley. Miss Adams be
gan her narration where she left off 'yes
terday, when she recounted in . detail her
father's inebriate actions in Hanford, Cal.
She traced his career from Hanford,
which place he left three years ago, to
the very day and hour of . the homicide,
giving a detailed account of all his move
ments and the series of debauches which
finally led him to the killing. Finally At
torney Church, for the defense, asked the
witness If she considered her father sane
or insane at the time he flred the fatal
shot, and she answered that there could
be no other conclusion, in her opinion,
than that he was insane and totally irre
sponsible.

A LESSON IN VALUES.
Y^^gOLLAR for dollar,' pound for pound, there is
T jj more in Ivory Soap than in any household
Jk^laK soap. It is easy to find a cheap soap; but
Vff*^ 1 to find purity and low price in a single. soap
is not easy. They combine in Ivory Soap. You
can afford to use it in the laundry; you can not
afford not to use it elsewhere. It is vegetable-oil
soap, in the cheapest form in which it can be pro-
cured. You pay nothing for a fancy box, wrapper
or 'perfume. It is all in4he soap! It floats.PROCEEDINGS OF THE EPISCOPAL CONVENTION.

Deficiency to September 1. 1901 for
Foreign Missions (see below)... $51,359 68
This deficiency of $102,719 36 for domestic
and foreign missions (including- $22,873 71 to
September 1 last year) has been temporarily
covered by the reserve deposits Bet aside a
number of years ago by the board of mana
gers from legacies and other sources amount
ing to $109,120 81, to meet the payments during
the early months of the year when the con. i
tributions are few. eo that while there is the
above very large deficiency in the receipts
for the year just closed, it may be said the
society Is not in debt.
The report of the treasurer was unani
mously adopted andJthe meeting then ad
journed for the regular recess.
Again, I wi*h to say to you that this society
possesses, without doubt, one of the most mag
rincent church mission houses In the world,
and that church mission house â rtiade possible
very largely by the generosity and the far
seelng ability, not only of the Rev. Dr. Lang
ford, but by one of the gentlemen on the floor
of this house (J. P. Morgan)â now enables the
society to get accommodations which otherwise
it would have to pay possibly $25,000 for every
year; enables the society to give the Woman's
Auxiliary all their accommodations without
cost.
That building stands on the balance sheet as
worth over $100,000. That is something we
should be very proud of, and not one dollar
of any missionary money ever went Into that
house. (Applause,) I Bee that I am heard.
I want to emphasize this fact for one reason:
The other day a friend of mine was coming up
through the streets of New York In one of the
cable cars, and as they approached the mission
house a clergyman who was showing a gen
tleman around tlie city said:
"There is the" church mission house built
by money contributed for missionary purposes
for the sake of giving these secretaries and
X-eople in New York palatial quarters."
Mpst unfortunately that was not taken tip
just then and there, but I made it the sub
ject of a short tract which I issued and had
published with regard to this matter.
I wish, in presenting the financial condition,
that we should all understand the emphasis
which should be put upon this great building,
free from debt and contributed for the useg of
the society as its headquarters." It is an ob
ject lesson day and night aa one goes up and
down in the city of New York.
Then again I want to call your attention to
the safeguards which are thrown around the
business of the office. I have had some ex
perience in the conduct of afrairs In an office;
I knew something about it. I have never been
in an office where the business was conducted
more strictly on business principles. The clerks
are prompt, they arc well officered: the assist
ant treasurer is a man of great' ability, a man
whom you ought to have and must have every
confidence in. In addition to that, nominated
by me - to the beard of managers and elected
by them after I make that nomination, he is
under bonds.
FUNDS OF THE BOARD
AEE CAtREFULLY CrTTAHDED
One change I found neceseary when I went
to the treasurer's department was in connec
tion with the drawing of checks. The rule was
interpreted to have the stubs of the check T
book and the check signed with one signature,
I changed that so there should be two signa
tures. 1 do not care so much about stubs, yet
the two signatures are necessary to draw
money. Those two signatures are either the
general secretary's or an associate on one side
and the treasurer or the assistant treasurer
on the other.
When we came hereâ I mention these things
because I am to talk about financial conditions
âI asked the board to allow me to take the
assistant treasurer here, as I thought he wouli}
be of use: and if I brought him I was to have
the privilege of naming an assistant secretary
to the treasurer, an acting assistant treasurer
who could take charge of matters while we
were away. About the signatures, I fixed it
in this way: The checks were signed by the
assistant treasurer and the associate separ
ately, and all drawn to the order of the Rev.
Robert Kimber, the acting assistant treasurer.
As far as we could we have safeguarded the
money. The treasurer has nothing to do with
the trust funds; they are in the charge of the
trust fund committee, and most careful are
their operations. One of the largest trust com
panies in the city of New York is its associate;
and every month these matters are reported
through the able chairman of the trust fund
committee, who is not with us at this time,
and who always . reports ' in connection there
with. Â¦ '.
This is about as much as I care to say at
this late hour regarding the financial condi
tion. The outlook has been explained to you.
Let me in closing say one word about the re
serve. No business can be properly con
dueted without a reserve; but no reserve Is
worth anything if it can't be used when a
time of emergency requires; and If we had not
had this reserve this year this society would
be in debt.
When I became treasurer I found the society
a borrower of money â a good borrower, no bet
ter in the world. It had security behind it in
its investments which were loose through its
trust funds, which gave it a proper standing
as a borrower. But I said: "This must stop;
we must net borrow money If we can help
it," glad as I would have been as a banker to
have loaned the society money.
SAYS RESERVE FUND
MUST BE INCREASED
I found some money in the reserve. I suc
ceeded through unexpected legacies and other
means in getting . other money. That reserve
has been almost depleted. There was not a
hundred thousand dollars' deficiency this year;
it was really a little less than eighty thousand
dollars, because last year we were twent>>two
thousand dollars out, and this year out a hun
dred and two thousand dollars, including the
twenty-two thousand dollars of last year'.
That reserve, gentlemen, has got to be put
back. That Is the financial condition. If that
reserve is put back and we can feel that it is
there we can go ahead and not take from a
missionary, who may have five hundred dol
lars' salary, thirty-seven dollars and fifÂ«y cents
this year. Is that right? Is that right? I
speak to men who have Influence In their dio
ceses. I beg them, to help me make up that
reserve. I want to make up that reserve. I
am ready to do my part, but I want some
help. I do not often stand cs a pleader for
money, but I do now. I ask your help to
make up this reserve.
I wish to say tp you gentlemen that as far
as I am concerned and as. long as I hold this
office, which is one of the proudest positions I
have reached, I want to say to you that I will
do my duty as far as I can' to guard this
money, but I can't raise it, and I do not con
sider that the treasurer's office requires that
he should do so.
I have tried to lay this financial condition
plainly and distinctly before you. I said at
the beginning it was fine; it Is fine; it is some
thing that we ought to be very thankful for.
But we want to stand where we ought to
stand in this great church of ours, and if God
wiU help us and give us his grace to do so, O,
what can we not accomplish! Were we not im
pressed when our brother read these closing
words;- "Our own duty Is to preach the gos
pel to all nations, whether they will hear, or
whether they will forbear."
Their conversion is in God's handa, and not
In ours; but we are responsible for their evan
gelization. The gospel must first be preached
unto all nations, and then shall the Son of
Man come. . (Prolonged applause.)
TREASURER PRESENTS
ELABORATE REPORT
The financial report submitted by Treas-
death of Dr. Langrford and In the period which
existed before the election of another general
secretary; I was forced to take responsibili
ties whtch the treasurer had never before as
sumed, those responsibilities having been taken
by me to the best of my ability. I found
when the new general secretary came that
I was possessed of information which I other
wise could not have received, and I have been
therefore able, I feel, in a measure to aid
him to the extent of my ability in the arduous
work in which he Is engaged.
>>ow. Just, one word. I am to talk about
the financial condition. It is admirable: the
financial condition could not be betterâ in one
particular, and that is this: AH our money
is as safe, I believe, as it Is possible for money
to be. It la watched and guarded with the
greatest of care. You have a board of man
agers who on every meeting day have the .re
ports of the treasurer audited by a specially
appointed committee, who have a specially em
ployed person for the purpose.

Mrs. James A. Garfield, widow of the
second martyred President of the United
States, arrived here yesterday in a spe
cial car en route to Pasadena, where she
will spend the winter months. She is not
in good health and the trip from the East
was very fatiguing to her. She Is accom
panied by her daughter, Mrs. James Stan
ley Brown, and four grandchildren. Mrs.
Garfieid did not leave her car on arriving
at the Oakland mole. The car was taken
across the bay on the freight boat and
coupled to the 6 o'clock train which left
the Third and Townsend streets depot for
Southern California.
Colonel Hitchcock, local representative
of the Union Pacific road, and William
McMurray of the Southern" Pacific met
Mrs. Garfield at Oakland and accompa
nied her to this city. She did not like to
discuss the assassination of President Mc-
Kinley, as it again or>ens the wounds of
her own grief. She said to Colonel Hitch
cock, however, that she hoped that in the
future the Government would take some
steps to more rigorously guard the Presi
dents of this country..

USUAL ROUTINE BUSINESS
There was an altercation yesterday be
tween Prank Powers, an attorney, and
Assistant Secretary Berliner of the Board
of Education. The trouble occurred in
the outer office of the board and began
when Powers took Berliner to task for
not giving his clerk certain information
from the records covering teachers' claims
for 189S. Berliner retorted that he had
given the data on Thursday, which asser
tion Powers denied. Berliner declared
that either Powers or his clerk lied,
whereupon the attorney shot out his fist
toward the secretary's nose. Berliner
ducked cleverly, and grabbing up an ink
bottle hurled it at his antagonist. Miss
Humphreys, private secretary to Presi
dent Kincaid, entered the office just then
and the bottle grazed her face. The ink
was spattered over her ciothes and on the
walls.
Powers asserts that some time ago Ber
liner wanted ia charge him $10 for a list
of the claims. Berliner says the list is
his private property, and not a public
record. He also says Powers offered him
?5 for it, but he refused to accept the
money.

PRESBYTERIANS DISCUSS
WORK OF HOME MISSIONS
I am to si>eak on the report of the board of
managers. I have no criticism to make, beÂ»
I cause the work of the board of managers has
! been admirable and all that it should be. We
could not .place our business in the hands of
a better set of men and no one could attend
to It more faithfully. But the only thing we
learn from that report Is that, notwithstanding
all that is done for diocesan missions and for
parish missions, we need a great deal more
money for our general work than we receive.
And I also find a feeling throughout the church
that we are perfectly able to provide that
money. After studying the question aver, I
find that instead of the $500,000 that we do
receive for missions we ought to be receiving
twice as much. It would enable us to stop
the mouths of the grumblers. We would not
have to ask the Woman's Auxiliary to do
what they always do, pay our debts. â¢
When the applause ceased the Bishop
offered the following resolution: â¢
Resolved, That $1,000,000 be raised for general
missions during the year beginning September
1. 1901.
Resolved. That this sum be apportioned
among the different dioceses and missionary
districts and that the Bishop and deputies of
each dioeese and missionary district be re
quested to take measures to provide for the
raising of the sum so appropriated.
Resolved. Tbat the offerings made through
the American Church Missionary Society be
considered as a part of this $1,000,000.
Resolved, That a committee consisting of
three Bishops, three presbyters and three lay
men be appointed by the Board of Missions,
who. after consultation with the 'Bishops and
deputies from each diocese and missionary dis
trict, shall make this apportionment and report
to this board before the adjournment of this
1 convention.
Resolved. That this committee be continued
until the next General Convention and be in
structed to make the apportionment each year.
The Bishop of Montana was then recog
nized and delivered a report of the board
of managers. He said:
Resolved. That the board of managers be di
rected to request an appropriation of a specific
sum from each and every diocese and from
every church to cover the deficiency in tlie
treasury of the beard, and that the action of
the board under this resolution be communi
cated to the Bishops of every diocese, who
are requested to take charge of the raising of
the money and all such collection be paid to
the board of managers.
DELIVERS THE REPORT
OF BOARD OF MANAGERS
A delegate from Georgia offered .the fol
lowing resolution, which was referred to
the committee on board of managers:
The resolution was adopted, and Bishop
Tuttle appointed the following committee:
The Bishop3 of 1 Alabama, Pennsylvania, We^t
Virginia, Tennessee. Washington, Rev. Edwin
S. Lines. Connecticut; Rev. H. S. Restarick.
Loe Angeles; Rev. Edwin B. Niver, Maryland;
Rev. Benjamin Brewster. Colorado; Rev. James
Goodwin, New Hampshire; Joseph Packard,
Maryland; Henry Hayes. Ohio; Joseph Wilmer,
Virginia; William H. Lelghton, Minnesota, and
John H. Stir.ees, Rhode Island.
.Reeolved. That a committee consisting of
five Bishops, five clergymen and five laymen
be appointed to report at the next (meeting of
the Board of Missions, such changes in the
present canon 7, title 3. of the constitution of
the domestic and foreign missionary societies,
as In Its judgment may tend to promote greater
efficiency In the work of that society.
a city of the East some stalwart patriots made
and passed a Declaration of Independence. The
far-reaching result of that action we have not
yet begun to measure. To-day on the Western
elope there is another declaration of inde
pendence, and now, Mr. President, 1 ask that
this body adopt the resolution by a rising vote.
Mr. Prince of New Mexico followed and
said: -
It appears to me that the appropriate action
of this body on this document which is pre
sented Is a little different from that which is
proposed by the church. The document asks
as a favor that the board hereafter make no
appropriations. I hope that the board accedes
to the request of the authorities of the diocese
of California, and trust that this admirable
example thus set by the Californian will be
followed by many other dioceses.
Both motions were carried. '
MISSIONARY SOCIETIES
ARE TO BE IMPBOVED
The Bishop of Washington then intro
duced the following resolution:
SCHOOL BOARD EMPLOYE
QUARRELS WITH ATTORNEY
It being close to the hour of adjourn
ment the Bishop of Maryland made a mo
tion to refer the consideration of the res
olution introduced by the Bishop of Mon
tana to the committee of fifteen appointed
to consider the resolution offered by Bish
op Satterlee. The motion was adopted
and the committee was directed to re
port at the next session.
An adjournment was then taken by the
Board of Missions until Thursday even
ing, October 10.
On Tuesday evening next the Board of
Missions will hold a mass-meeting in Me
chanics' Pavilion.
t^^.^^.;..;,.;..;..;..;..;..;..;..;..:..;..; ,;.,;,;Â¦Â¦;Â¦Â¦:Â¦Â¦?Â¦Â¦;Â¦ Â©
Kow I think the attention of the board should
be directed to every baptized person in the
whole church, because that baptism conse
crates a man to be a missionary to Jesus
Christ.
The Rev. Dr. Greer of New York fol
lowed, and- said he wished to protest
against the statement that had been made
several times at the meeting of this Board
of Missions that there were 4700 Christian
parishes in connection with the church in
â¢the United States which contribute noth
ing and have contributed nothing during
the last year toward the missionary work
of the church. Continuing he said:
There Is not a Christian parish anywhere in
the country, large or small, that is not doing
missionary work. If they were going to raise
$1,000,000 let them give encouragement and rec
ognition of their work throughout the whole
church. Let them say to the struggling little
parishes: "You are doing missionary work,
and splendid work at that, according to your
means." They might be doing it among the
poor and Ignorant of their own little strug
gling parishes, but It was good work and
should be,.*ommended and encouraged instead
of being' slurred by such remarks as had been
heard on the floor. **"
Dr. Greer continued in this strain,
speaking forcibly and eloquently and
evoking applause, notwithstanding the
rule against such manifestations of ap
proval.
The Rev. Dr. Spalding of Alabama fol
lowed. He simply wished to emphasize
the last thought of the Bishop of Pennsyl
vania. In part he said:
I wish to advocate this measure because it
Is going to bring home to the heart of each in
dividual of the church the question of the
spreading of the Gospel throughout the world.
It seems to me that thought and consideration
enough has not been giveji to the small sums
which are the fruit of self-denial of conse
crated persons.
The large rivera are made up of little drops
of water. And somehow oranother we fall to
touch the common life of our congregations.
I sometimes do a little mathematical figuring
on this subject. Now I understand, if I caught
the figures correctly, there are 700.000 communi
cants in this church and the Board of Mis
sions had to expend about $700,000. Now, sup
pose that of these 700,000 communicants each
communicant was to lay aside one penny a day
for the work days of the year. We would
have just three times the amount of money
that has been appropriated during the past
year. A man giving up one cigar a week
(applause) would make some appropriation and
a very considerable one toward the accumula
tion of this fund.
AN EARNEST PROTEST
The Rev. Dr. Mann of Western Missouri
in seconding the resolution said that there
appeared to be apathy in the church and
timidity on the part of the board of. man
agersâon the part of the first in giving
for missionary purposes, and on the part
of the latter in asking, and each was
the cause of the other. There is a deficit,
according- to the report, , of over $100,000.
There are a hundred men in the church
each of whom could pay the entire de
ficit without impairing his fortune. But
It rested with the clergy in the last resort.
There would be no permanent success un
til the parish clergy throughout the coun
try were aroused and interested and took
the matter in hand.
The discussion was continued by the
Rev. Mr. Tempa of Vermont and the
Bishop of Marquette. The last named
suggested that a subscription be started
during the meeting of the convention,
saying he wished to subscribe himself,
and a friend had shown him three names
on a card who wished to subscribe $1000
each. He believed the whole deficit could
be made up in 1 his way and the impair
ment of the reserve be avoided.
The Bishop of Pennsylvania, who was
a personal friend of the late Dr. Langford
and -a. missionary worker, spoke of a plan
to raise money. He said he spoke from
experience, and advocated an apportion
ment plan to obviate deficiencies in the
treasury.

PAINE'S CZLES.Y COMPOUND.
MOURNING Iff
MANY A FAMILY
Precious Lives That Alight
Have Been Saved
If Paine's Celery Compound
Had Early Been Used
Instead of Putting Faith in
Wortnless Cure-Alls. '
TJscre should be new legislation against
the exercise of criminal ignorance in tlmea
of sickness.
Many a good family is In mourning- to-
day for the loss <st a relative who, when
first the symptoms of serious sickness ap-
peared, made the fatal mistake of simply
taking the wrong medicine.
As soon think of stopping the sun with
a wave of the hand as of stopping the
ornrard course of disease in the human
sy-Btem with any. of thÂ« various patent
ccneoctions tinder patent names so num-
erously in the market to-day.
There is but one remedy known to medi-
cine that can bring: new life and vigor to
â¢worn out nerves, restore to their normal
condition the functions* that depend upon
nerves and brain, properly nourished and
Xed. tfcat cures sleeplessness, allays indi-
rection, sends healthy blood coursing
through the veins, tones up the system
and makes the weak strong again, and
that Is Paine'g celery compoundâ the dis-
covery of the greatest of America's many
physicians.
Paine's celery compound is not a pat-
ent njÂ©dicine. It is thp one prepared rem-
edy that has the unqualified indorsement
of those physicians whose knowledge and â¢
- Â¦ Â¦ i
HON. R. U McKEE.
ability have made their names known not
ccly among their immediate neighbors but
throughout the country.
Xo other prepared remedy was ever rec-
on.mended publicly or privately by the
head of the medical department of a
great university. No other remedy ever
bad the hearty, bona fide indorsement of
the wives and households of the wealth-
iest as well as the poorer citizens in every
community.
A single bottle, to be had of any repu-
table druggist, will prove its unequaled
merit to any family where to-day some
member suffers from the much-to-be-
feared beginnings of what before the win-
ter is past, unless attended to promptly,
may prove to be the final breakdown.
"Paine's celery compound," says Hor.
R. L. McKee of Jefferson City, one of
the soundest men in public life in Mis-
souri, "Paine's celery compound is so well
known that I feel that a recommendation
from me can add very little weight, but
I do wish to gratefully recommend it to
those who have never been so fortunate
as to try it."
There Is no season eo favorable as this
for taking advantage of the wonderfully
renovating virtues of this remedy. Don't
begin the winter in poor health. Nature
does little at this season to rejuvenate un-
aided the fagged out brain or to restore
to health the diseased nerves. Paine's
celery compound nourishes perfectly the
bcdily system. It cures diseases of the
important organs of digestion, circulation
and excretion, regulates the entire nerv-
ous ej-stem and supplies the body with
strength to combat disease.

The campaign committee met day be
fore yesterday and organized by the elec
tion of Maurice L. Asher chairman, P. H.
Prendergaat secretary and Frank French
treasurer. Max Goldberg and P. H.
Prendegast .were appointed to select
headquarters for the campaign. They
have selected rooms at 620 Market street.
Tho Republican candidates held a meet
inâ¢ last night at the old County Commit
te-i rooms, 620 Market street. Auditor
Wells did not grace the occasion by his
presence. Among other .absentees were
A. B. Mahony, nominee for County Clerk
and Ed J. Smith, candidate for Tax Col
lector. The conference was called to con
sider the subject of campaign contribu
tions. Thore was diversity of opinion re
garding the amount that should be put
In possession of the compaign committee
to make a general fight. The law allows
a candidate to expend 10 per cent of his
first year's salary. A proposition to don
ate. SO per. cent of this allowance was not
favored by a majority of the candidates
and the proposition was ultimately re
duced to 60 per cent. Provided all the
candidates "pony up" this donation will
give the committee $4884. The aggregate
of a year's salary of all the offices to be
filled at. the next election is . $S1,400. The
candidates are permitted to spend 10 per
cent or an aggregate sum of $8140. and
of the latter amount 60 per cent or $4SS4 is
donated. The residue $3256 may be ex
pended at the pleasure of the "respective
nominees. i
In the absence of Colonel Burns all the
troubles in the camp were passed up to
Herrin. When Wells paced the floor of his
apartments at the Pleasanton and threat
ened to step down and out if B. P. Flint
was not put on the ticket for Supervisor
Goldberg was almost frightened out of his
wits. When Wells saw that Goldberg was
weakening he renewed his threats to re
sign. Goldberg, grasping the telephone,
called on Herrln for relief. In response to
an immediate summons Goldberg lost his
presence of mind and hired a carriage to
go to Herrin' s house. What followed at
the Herrin residence can only be con
jectured. Perhaps the nominee for Mayor
was spoken of in complimentary terms,
but the words of comDliment were not
taken down. . It seems, however, that Her
rin assented In general principle to the
proposition that the nominee for Mayor
should have been consulted in naming one
candidate for Supervisor.
Candidates Hold Conference.
Gol/Iberg Receives Bad Fright.
Asa R. Wells, the Republican nominee
for Mayor, and his associates on the
ticket are having' a circus. Wells broadly
insinuates that some of the nominees for
the Board of Supervisors are no good.
The would-be Supervisors who were care
fully selected by Jere Burke do not hesi
tate to hint that Wells is "daffy", and
ought to be pulled off the ticket. N Chair
man Thomas D. Rlordan, chairman of the
Jate Republican Convention, was so hot
around the collar when he heard that
Wells had sent Max Goldberg to Herrin
with a threat to resign that he offered to
pay $500 out of his own pocket if the can
dld^to for Mayor would get off the ticket.
Riordan is willing' that Wells shall stay
on the earth, but wants him to come off
the party perch. t .
Now conies Brilsford'P. Flint, saying
that nothing could induce him at this
time to go on the ticket for Supervisor,
In view of Flint's present attitude Wells
recalls his threat to withdraw from the
race. The outcome of the whole uproar
Is the placing of Max Goldberg on the
campaign committee.
In the Republican Camp.
A. G. Maguire, chairman of the commit
tee' en Supervisors, then moved an ad
journment until this evening at 7 o'clock,
saying- that the committee desired to ex
amine the names suggested and find if
they were entirely satisfactory. An ad
journment was then taken.
Jjittja time was lost in naming candi
dates. Joseph Rothschild of the Fortieth
District named Bam H. Brooks for Treas
urer, and Brooks was elected by acclama
tion.
Thomas M. O'Connor of the Twenty
ninth District in a humorous speech
named Bdmond Godchaux for Recorder.
He was the only candidate and the nomi
nation was made by acclamation.
Patrick Boland was nominated for Pub
lic Administrator by Charles A. Sweigert
.of the Thirty-seventh District, There was
no opposition.
Porter AshÂ© was greeted with cheers
when he took the platform to name Lewis
F. Byington for District Attorney He
was chosen without opposition.
For Police Judge George A. Connolly of
the Fortieth District named Judge AJfred
J. Fritz, and Thomas M. O'Connor named
Judge Charles T. Conlan. There were no
other candidates.
Joseph Fassler was nominated for Tax
Collector by Curtis Hlllyer and chosen
without opposition.
The chair then asked before the conven
tion adjourned to meet at Metropolitan
Hall this evening that the delegates form
themselves into district conventions, each
to select four -members to the County
Committee.
Name a Few Candidates.
We believe in the right of the Â¦workingmen
to organize In unions and recognize that these
uniins are potent influences in promoting their
welfare. -Modern industrial conditions require
a recognition frpnj both employer and employe
that their interests are mutual and that ar
bitration brings about the quickest and most
satisfactory solution of their differences,
Wihln the past few weeks a national calam
ity has befallen us. Our honored President.
William McKinley, is fallen by the hand of
an assassin. We Join with the. entire nation
in mourning the loss of our respected and
well-beloved Chief Executive.
Our city now holds such a position amon^r
the~ commercial centers ' of the world and has
so thoroughly shown its capacity for self-gov.
ernment that it is an injustice to itself and
a detriment to the Interests of the State that
our water front, the most Important agency oÂ£
our commercial activity, should not be under
our own direct and exclusive control; and we,
therefore, urge that its management should be
turned over to the city.
Believing in American civilization; and ill
the established standard of its citizenship, and
being opposed to the competitipn of cheap labor
with that of our worklngmen, we demand the
renewal of the Chinese exclusion act, and urge
that the new law perpetually exclude all
?static labor.
j We demand that water mains large enough to
secure complete fire protection be Jaid In ac
cordance with the recommendations of the
ehlef engineer of the Fire Department.
Â¦ We demand tho immediate â¢ building of a
euf Sclent number of'Qreproof school houses to
accommodate all the children of the city.
We pledge our nominees to continue the work
Â¦Â»f replacing the cobbles on the business Btreeta
O< the city by smoother, cleaner and more sani
tary pavements.
The Mayor and Board of Supervisors have
inaugurated these and other great economics
and improvements, and we commend their zeal
in the public welfare.
They have fixed the rate of wages for labor
in the Department of Public Worka at $2 50
per day, giving the city the best service and
fixing a fair standard for -wages.
They have specified In all contracts that
eight hours shall constitute a day's labor and
have required the Allied Printing Trades'
stamp on all printing and stationery as a
guarantee of. fair wages and reasonable hours.
They have fixed a 2Vfc-cent car fare for the
benefit of school children, and have put' the
eystem in successful operation.
We pledge our candidates for Mayor and the
Board of Supervisors to continue to set aside
for permanent public improvements as large
a cum as the condition of the assessment roll
ehajl Justify.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 4.â A penny contribu
tion by a little girl at the Catholic fair
given in Turn Verein Hall in this city last
fall by St. Joseph's parish has formed
the nucleus of a fund that has erected a
church and parish house in Nome, Alas
ka. With this one cent as a starter sev
eral thousand dollars have been raised
and a large and imposing edifice is being
erected. A few months ago Father Jac
quet of this city left to work in the
Alaska missions, and letters received from
him by the Rev, Father Gleason of this
city tell the story of the building of the
Nome church.
While Father Jacquet was connected
with St. Joseph's parish he attended the
Catholic fair. A little girl approached
him during the progress of the fair one
evening and- handing- him a penny said
she had found it on the floor of the hall.
She asked that the coin be kept by the
father for some good purpose. Father
Jacquet put the copper coin carefully
away When the fair's balances were
btruck it was found that more than $12,
000 had been cleared for St. Joseph's par
ish and, as Father Jacquet jocularly re
marked a penny from a little child was
what the priest* got out of it.
When Father Jacquet started for Nome
he announced his intention of taking the
little cdrl'B penny with him, for, said he:
"with this 1 will build a church in
He took the coin, and by this time his
hope3 have been, realized. From this
trivial coin a parish house was erected in
Nome shortly after his arrival, and the
foundation for the chapel was under way
more than a month ago, when the letter
W Before Father Jacquet's arrival Nome
had no church. He celebrated his first
mass in & public hall on Sunday, July 7.
At that time iie related the story of the
child's penny -and his intentions to found
a church from a fund started with It, and
from that moment subscriptions began to
roll in. Several thousand dollars have
already been raised. The new. parish at
Nome has been named. St. Joseph's, and
the parish here haÂ« sent Father Jacquet
a beautiful etatue of the" patron saint of.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
That owing now to the thoroughly demoral
ized condition of the market and to the late
ness of. the season each grower be allowed to
market his crop in any manner he may choose.
The minority makes no recommenda
tion. It realizes the impossibility of
handling the crop under the new lease
and urges that all possible support be
given to . place the association on a solid
basis.
That the prices, of raisins named by the di
rectors of the California Raisin Growers' Asso
ciation on this year's crop were lower than

GRASS VALLEY, Oct. 4.-Stqod up at a
pistol's point and compelled to . stand
barefoot in the snow while two masked
highwaymen relieved him of $65 in gold,
a watch and a revolver, was the exciting
experience which befell John Blarney of
this city on Wednesday. Mr. Blarney has
Just returned from the Sierraville races
and tells the story.
Blarney was on his way to Grass Val
ley in the midst of a snowstorm when
two masked men stopped him and com
pelled him to dismount from his cart.
They took his watch and revolver from
him, and tlndinsj no com in his clothing
made him take off his .shoes and hose
and stand barefoot in the snow while they
pocketed $65 which he had hidden in his
hose. They ordered him to get into his
cart and drivj? on without looking back.
The only comfort Blarney got was the
knowledge that the robbers overlooked a
large sum of money which he carried in a
valise in the bottom of his cart.

The utmost economy has prevailed in the
management of the city government and its
cost has been reduced, while Its efficiency fjas
b<Â»n preatly inereaFed, owing to the Inaugura

tem, whereby fitness for office is made the sole
qualification and citizens may serve the pub

Notwithstanding the lower tax rate and the

Three hundred and eighty thousand dollars has
been appropriated for the construction Of
streets and sewers, for the making of perma

new public buildings, and a debt of $320,000 due
merchants and teachers from past administra

within th* dollar limit and without incurring
a dollar of public debt.
The Democratic party is proud of having re
stored the credit of the city.
The Mayor and Board of Bupervifcors have
lowered the rates for water and have- saved
the ratepayers 1275,000 during- the past two
years. This year they saved the city on its
water bills $140,000. while etill allowing the
v/ater company a fair return upon the real
value of its property actually used for the
Â¦water supply.
Louis de F. Bartlett read the report of
the committee on platform and resolutions
as follows:
The Democratic party of the city and county
of San Francisco, in convention assembled,
adopts this as its platform and declaration of
principles.
The results achieved by the present adminis
tration demonstrate the truth set forth in our
last platform that the best municipal govern
ment is obtained by the separation of local
from State and national issues. It is in accord
with the letter and spirit of our charter. The
introduction of extraneous questions Is de
signed to obscure municipal issues.
The municipal government was intrusted to
the Democratic party two years ago and we
now present to the public an account of our
stewardship.
The rate of taxation has been lowered to $1 07,
the lowest rate for many years. "
A resolution of sympathy for the death
of Lawrence J. Hoey, a former Assembly
man, was also read by Delegate Mooser
and adopted.
Platform Full of Praise.
Resolved. That the chairman appoint a com
mittee of five to act as & committee required
by the purity of elections law.
Resolved. That the chairman appoint a com
mittee of five on vacancies.
Resolved. That all resolutions Introduced be
referred without reading to the committee on
platform and resolutions.
Resolved. That the nominating speeches be
limited to five minutes.
Resolved, That each candidate on being placed
in nomination pay to the secretary the sum of
Jio.
Resolved, That the Democratic County Com
mittee consist of 112 members, four to be
chosen by the delegations from each Assembly
district and forty appointed at large by the
chairman of the convention.
L. H. Mooser of the Forty-first present
ed the following report of the committee
on order of business, and It was adopted
without dissension:
To the Chairman and Members of the Demo
cratic Convention â Tour committee on order of
business respectively reports the following or
der of business: Nomination of candidates for
âFirst. Treasurer; second. Keoorder; third,
Pub'ic Administrator; fourth. District Attor

lector; seventh. Auditor; eig-hth. County Clerk;
ninth. Sheriff; tenth. Coroner; eleventh, City
Attorney; twelfth, Mayor; thirteenth, eighteen
Supervisors; fourteenth, election of County
Committee.
Tour committee recommends that the follow
ing' resolutions be adopted:
Chairman W. H. McGee called the con
vention to order at S:45 o'clock, and on
motion it was decided to dispense with
the calling of the roll. The chairman was
empowered to appoint two assistant sec
retaries. He named Frank Kenton and
L. Boland. He was also delegated to ap
point A. J. McDonald of the Fortieth
District as sergeant at arms and Patrick
Manning, J. J. Welch, Frank Me Lain and
John J. Finn as assistants.
It was positively announced by the
Democratic leaders at midnight that May
or James D. Phelan, after considerable
pressure ha.d been brought to bear upon
him, had consented to allow his name to
go before the convention as a candidate
for the Mayoralty for a fourth term.
Mcyor Phelan was told he was the only
man who could lead the party out of the
wilderness, and he reluctantly said he
would run. Franklin K. Lane will again
be nominated for City and County Attor
ney, and those members of tho present
Board of Supervisors who have stood
with the Phelan administration through
thick and thin will also receive nomina
tions. The programme will be rushed
through as fast as possible to-night at
Metropolitan Temple. Registrar Walsh
will keep his office open until midnight in
order to receive the certificates of nomi

hour.

trict Attorney, Tax Collector and Police
Judges were perfunctorily made without
the eign or semblance of opposition. The
delegates will complete the nominations
at Metropolitan Temple this evening and
file the ticket in accordance with law be
fore midnight. The impression Is clear
that James D. Phelan will be renomin
ated for Mayor. The leaders are assert
ing that he cannot afford to desert his
party and his political associates at this
time, and that he must take the place at
the head of the ticket. Under the order
of business adopted last night nomina
tions for Mayor and Supervisors come
last on the list. The Indications are that
all the Democratic Supervisors will be re
nominated.

"About a year ago a doctor and his
wife came to board with us. "We already
had Miss G., who was at that time thin
and yellow and considerably out of
health.
"The first morning the new boarders
came to the table as guests the young
!ady remarked as she set her cup down,
'Th's is coffee!' while the doctor added.
'Not at all like the poor coffee they have
been giving us at the hotel.' I smiled be-
hind my napkin and asked if either of
them ever used Postum Food Coffee. The
doctor said hfi had tasted it, but it was
weak, miserable stuff. Miss G. had heard
of it and wished she could try it.
"I said nothing, but at the end of three
months, when Miss G. was ready to leave
lit for a new field of labor, said, 'I have
U'en giving you Postum Food Coffee all
the time you have been here.' 'What, is
that coffee Postum T ehe said. I re-
marked that I had noticed with great
Pleasure her daily gain in health, and
now that she was leaving us after only
three months at our table ehe had rosy
cheeks and a. plump figure, which was all
the argument any one needed to prove the
fact that she had been well cared for,
tnd the reason for her gain in health was
the use of Postum Food Coffee, for nÂ»
other change had been made of any ac-
count in her food, ->";

with the experiment, and discovered that

Graduate Nurse, and President of Nurses' Association
of Watertown, N.T.,
Tells How Much Doctors Use Lydia
E.Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, i
- ' â - %\
Has Yet To Hear of Its Failure To Cure. !
It is not infrequent that information comes to our attention proving that
the medical profession in general prescribe large quantities of Ijydia E.
IMnkham's vegetable Compound in their private practise.
It is a fact beyond dispute that nowhere is to be found a remedy so
universally successful in curing female ills, and the broad-minded physician
of to-day is quick to recognize his duty to his patient, and does not hesitate to
prescribe the best medicine he can find, â the medicine that is surest and
quickest to bring 1 relief to his patient ; for this very reason thousands of the
very best physicians are prescribing in their treatment of female ills Lyiiia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, while not in original bottles
perhaps, but in plain prescription bottles with their own or drug-gists' name.
It is our pleasure and our privilege to publish a letter from a graduate
nurse whose reputation and prominence in her profession lends much weight
to her opinions, and -whose testimony goes to prove our statements in regard
to the high esteem in which livdia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
is held by our leading physicians and trained nurses. ,
MISS VIRGINIA GRAXES.
"Pear Mrs. Pinkham: â Twelve years continuous service at the
sick beds in some of our prominent hospitals, as well as at private homes,
has given me varied experiences with the diseases of .women. I have
nursed some most distressing cases of inflammation and ulceration of
the ovaries and womb. I have known that doctors used Lvdia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound when everything else failed with
their patients. -I have advised my patients and friends to use it, and
have yet to hear of its first failure to cure.
Â£ Four year3 ago I had falling of the womb from straining in Hf ting
a heavy patient, and knowing of the value of your Compound I began to
use it at once, and hi six weeks I was well once more, and have had no
trouble since. I am most pleased to have had an opportunity to say a
few words in praise of your Vegetable Compound, and shall take every
occasion to recommend it." â Miss Virginia Graces, 444 So. Spring St,
Los Angeles, CaL [Present address.]
' Be it, therefore, believed by all women who are ill that X,ydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is the medicine they should
take. It has stood the test of time, and it has- hundreds of thou-
sands of cures to its credit. It should, therefore, be considered
unwise to experiment further.
Mrs. Plnkham,whose address is Lynn, Mass., will answer cheer-
fully and without cost all letters addressed to her by sick women.

a lower corn market which had little recupera
tive power. Statistics were bearish and. lack
ing a decided leadership, the crowd favored the
selling side. December opened H@%c lower at
56%@56%c on lower cables and on good weather
for maturing crops. The outside demand . was
slow and nearly all the buying was for the
short interest. December worked off to 66%c,
but recovered most of the Iobs until Snow's re
port came out. Indicating 1 point higher in last?
month's crop condition. This depressed the
market again and December closed . weak, %c
down, at 56&c- ' i
Â¦ Wheat ruled easier, with nothing of Interest
In a speculative way. The few orders placed
Â¦were not enough to Influence the 'market either
way. December opened %@V4c down at 6S%@>
6SV2C on lower cables, heavy receipts *. and fine
harvesting weather. Most of . the traders de-
Berted wheat for the corn pit and as a result
wheat followed the coarser cereal somewhat.
December fluctuated very narrowly and touched
6S%@C8%c, closing steady. %c lower, at 68%c.
. Oats â¢ were dull. December closed a shade
lower at 35%@35%c.

Nezv York Grain and Produce
Condition of tlie Industrials.
The New Tork circular of Hei^y Clews cays:
"While the boom was In progress the Indus
trials Â¦were comparatively neglected and the
pufclio fortunately took limited interest In
their gyrations. When prosperity was at its
height their destiny was left to the future
and the day of reckoning which every one ex
pected ceased to have any terrors; the penal
ties of excessive capitalization, the problems
of management and of other perils incidental
to an industrial revolution involving billions
of capital were almost forgotten. Familiarity
Â¦with danger dulled apprehensions, and the
risks to theee unwieldy combinations from
new competition were easily overlooked. Yet
the very prosperity which facilitated their
birth also created a set of new, vigorous, well
equipped, low capitalised rivals, free of heavy
obligations, whose operations were likely to
be felt with Increasing force as time pro
gressed. It was Inevitable, therefore, that the
industrials would be the first to feel the effects
of any trade reaction; particularly in view of
the greatly Increased capacity for production.
Within a short period we have had unsatis
factory h"""Â»i reports from several of the
prominent comblnaticnE, the results of which
nre anything but encouraging to stockholders.
Rumors affecting the management of some of
these concerns have added to the disturbance
of confidence and prompted bearish attacks.
The decline in Amalgamated Copper, which
had lte foundation in a lessened demand for
the product, was a particularly disturbing
factor; partly because it euggested trade re
action and partly because it seemed to explain
the indlCerence of important interests toward
at bull market at this time. Whether the
Standard Oil party are adverse to an upward
movement or not. It is evident that the in
dustrials are a weak element in the market
Just now. Apart from their inherent defects
arising from bad financing they are more ex
posed to sharp fluctuations from trade vicissi
tudes and speculative management than was
ever possible with the railroads. The latter are
now reasonably capitalized and honestly man
aged, and the Intelligent Investor has no diffi
culty in ascertaining the essential facts as to
their intrinsic value. This much cannot be
said cf the Industrials. Secrecy is still one of
the objectionable features In their manage
ment, and public opinion is vastly more hos
tile to them than to the railroads In spite of
the great powers of the latter and their tre
mendous combinations. What the next Con
gress will do with the trusts is an Important
Question that will soon confront us. Some
action seems very likely to be taken, and
President Roosevelt, conservative as he now
may be. has never shown any particular
friendliness for these combinations. Publicity
of some sort will probably be Insisted upon
*nd this Is Just what Is most needed though
iaast desired by speculative managers."

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND ' GENERAL
FORECAST.
The pressure has fallen rapidly during the
past twenty-four hours .along the Sierras and
also along the pouthem coast. "Cloudy weather
pre\-alls over Northern California and sprin
kles of rain are reported along the coast from
Point Reyes northward. A- moderate disturb
ance appears to be developing In Northern Ne
vada.
The temperature still continues slightly below
the normal in the great valley* and conditions
ere not very favorable for raisin making.
Forecast made at San 'Francisco for thirty

ably light showers- along the northern coast;

tion to call loans, in order to limit or throw
out Industrial stocks from the collateral. No
special discrimination was exercised against
Amalgamated Copper yesterday, but such dis
crimination was reflected in to-day's acute
weakness of the stock. I Tho same was true of
the Consolidated Tobacco 4 per cent bonds,
which fell an extreme 2 points. Other stocks
affected were General Electric, 6%, Diamond
Match, 6; United States Express, 4%; Consoli
dated Gas, 4; National Biscuit preferred, 3;
Sugar, 2%, and Smelting; 2%.
In the low-priced railroad stocks Lake Erie
and Western lost 6%; St. Joseph and Grand
Island secend preferred, 2; Minneapolis, St.
Paul and Sault Ste. Marie preferred, 3%;
Kvansville and Terre Haute and Kanawha and
Michigan, 3; Toledo, St. Louis and Western,
2% each. Some of the severest losers yesterday
showed a rallying tendency even before the
general market turned upward, and in the late
recovery there were some net gains of a point
and more achieved. National Salt recovered 11
points of yesterday's 14% loss on three transac
tions. The late rally seemed to be due entirely
to covering by shorts and was made in spite
of the promise of only a moderately favorable
bank statement. The interior movement of
currency during the week has again been very
heavy, so that the gain in account of Govern
ment bond purchases and Australian gold has
been almost offset. It Is hoped that the li
quidation in the stock market will be reflected
In a loan contraction, as no special operations
in the money market are known which Wwould
offset this Influence. unlesB It might be re
newed borrowing from the local banks of the
loans to foreign lenders, which are being con
stantly liquidated, as reflected In the sustained
strength of the foreign exchange market.
The stock market closed quite active and
strong at the recovery.
The railroad bond market was affected by
selling to-day more than on previous days of
the week. Total sales, par value, $2,700,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call. ' .

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Oct. 4.â The Commercial Bulletin
will say to-morrow of the wool trade of the
United States: The market is much quieter,
but prices continue steady and even the higher
prices paid in Montana are Â¦ justified by the
sales this week. The high activity of the mills
is evinced by the fact that mills that habitually
ecour all their own wool have been buying
scoured wool in Boston this week as their own
scouring plants cannot keep up with the ac
tivity of the rest of the machinery. The re
ceipts of wool in Boston since January 1 has
been 220,333,400 pounds, against 142,499,865 pounds
for the same period. In 1900. The Boston ship
ments to date are 194.235,517 pounds, against
sales of 108,240,000 pounds for the same- period
in 1900. - â¢

COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL
THE 'SAN^'FRAN^^
Manufacturing Is of such vigor that few
wheels are Idle and further wage agreements
have reduced the numbbr of strikers to a min
imum. Mild weather, yacht races. and other
temporary influences curtailed the volume or
retail sales In this city, but Jobbing and whole
sale concerns are preparing for exceptional
transactions. Foreign trade la also heavy.
Nothing new has developed In regard to the
iron and steel situation and, with the mills
crowded in their efforts to overtake consump
tive demand, there is little prospect of any
material change in the market for some time.
Contracts for an enormous quantity of. steel
rails, deliverable next year at current . quo
tations. Indicate the general confidence in the
general â¢eTablllty of prices and the expansion
of railway facilities required to meet the
growing needs of the country. Finished steel
and pigiron sales are of satisfactory volume.
Steadiness is still the feature in textile mar
kets. New orders for woolens are slow, but
buyers complain of late delivery on old con
tracts. This might result in cancellations if
the demand was not uniformly brisk and deal
ers unable to secure goods elsewhere. .
Â¦Wool comes forward freely and supplies are
ample. A slight advance to 17&c was reported
in the average price of one hundred grades on
October 11, to Coates Bros.' circular. Sup
plementary orders for winter footwear made
the situation rather more satisfactory than
producers anticipated, while Jobbers, are un
able to secure goods to fill orders.
Hides were violently advanced to the highest
price of the year.
Staple products have declined moderately as
a rule, with the exception of cotton and pork
products. The variation . was widest- in corn.
Wheat was also easier, partially due to con
flicting estimates of foreign crops and needs,
while exports from, the United States were
smaller than In the preceding week. The great
size of the domestio wheat crop this year i3
indicated by interior receipts of 8,411,775.bush
els, against 6, ISO, 581 bushels last year and
6,664,113 In 1899. - : â¢:

OAKLAND, Oct. 4.-Carollne Peterson,
a domestic employed by Mrs. H. C. Cap
well, residing at Oakland and Fair view
avenues, is in custody of the police.. ThÂ«
young woman surrendered a ?175 diamond
ring to-day, the disappearance of which
Mrs. Capwell had reported to Chief of
Police Hodgkins only an hour before tha
gem was found in the servant girl's pos
session. ' .
The detectives also have in charge a
valise containing considerable jewelry,
silverware, bric-a-brac, purses and a small
pistol. This property was found in. the j
woman's room at. the Capwell residence.
Until satisfactory evidence concerning
the presence of the strange miscellaneous
collection of valuables shall have been se
cured the' prisoner will be detained at the
City Prison.
She declares that the wares are her
own property, given to her by Lady Leilah
Yarde Builer, with whom she formerly re
sided as a companion. Some of the silver
ware bears tne monogram letter B.
Other spoons and forks in the collection
are marked "M. P. V. C," and a single
spoon Is stamped "Albany.'
The ring Incident which led to the un
covering of the bag of jewelry occurred
this afternoon. Mrs. Capwell missed the
valuable gem shortly after noon. She Im
mediately notllied the police. Detectives
Shorey and Holland went post haste to
the residence and there found the dom
estic very defiant and Indignant, her
mistress having suggested that the girl
might know something about the missing
jewelry.
During a conversation with Detective
Shorey the girl made a pretext to leave
the room. She was followed and finally
took the gem from its hiding place in her
clothing "and passed it to Mrs. Capwell in
the detective's presence. He arrested the
girl and then took the valise which was in
her room. â, _ ,
The woman was taken to the City Pri
son. There the contents of the satchel
were exposed. Such a motley collection or
stuff was never before uncovered in the
Jail. â¢â¢ i Â¦ .
Besides several dozen assorted pieces of
tableware, variously inscribed, there were
smelling salts bottles, cracker jars, gold
lined cups and other utensils for table
use, gold bracelets -and brooches, stick
pins and rings, a score of odds and ends
in fancy design for women's wear, orna
mental clasps in abundance, half a. dozen
gold finished strainers, fruit knives, napr
kins, silk handkerchiefs contributed to
this miniature "old curiosity shop." ,
Among the stolen property records at
the police office there is no note of miss
ing jewelry which meets the description of
that contained In the prisoner's valise.
The Capwells say they will not prose
cute the woman for the theft of the ring,
so happy are they to have recovered it.
The police have not decided what to do
with their charge and her motley array
of wares.

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
An explosion of gases In an oil tank
car at the West Oakland railroad yards
this morning caused the probable fatal
burning of James Jackson and James
Robinson, boilermakers, who were im
prisoned in the car tank, where they had
been riveting. The men tried to escape
by a manhole, but were caught by the
flame and superheated gas that shot out
of the hole as from a furnace.
As soon as the imprisoned workmen
could be rescued medical attendance was
summoned, and after temporary dressing
of their frightful burns was accomplished
the injured workmen were hurried to the
Southern Pacitic Company's hospital at
San Francisco. The flesh on KoDinson s
hands and face was literally cooked and
it dropped off his injured hands as the
rescuers dragged him out of the man
hole. Jackson was as badly burned about
the face and hands. â¢
The car was on the siding at the ma
chine shops, where a crew of men had
been put to work to rivet loose joints of
the big iron tank. The heated bolts were
being passed into the car where Jackson
and Robinson were lacing the rivets
through the rivet holes from the inside,
holding them in place while they were
drl\en down from the outside.
A spark from one of the heated rivets
dropped into the residuum of oil and
debris. The contact caused the ex
plosion. The prisoners made for the man
hole and before they could get through
the mass of sas and flame enveloped
Robinson resides in Berkeley and Jack
son's home is at West Oakland. The

thoroughly. There was no dock available
at the time the men were ready to begin
work, so the captain decided to do the
job alongside the wharf. It will probably
prove to be the more expensive method,
but the work can be more thoroughly
done, as the calker can strike a straight
downward blow instead of upward, as he
would have to do were the ship on the
dock. The Lucile was accordingly hove
down, or keelhauled, and she now lies
with her keel out of water and "her yards
almost touching the wharf. Gan^s of men
are running all over her side. In the old
days all vessels were repaired in this
manner. Even now many a vessel Is
treated in the same way. but the work
is generally done in Mission Bay and not
alongside a wharf.

U. E. Tyson, secretary o( tnls organization,
has received a letter from United States Coun
sel Orlando H. Baker of Sydney, Australia. In
which he says: "The Tyson who died some
two years ago was named James. He had a.
brother and sisters In this country, among
whom the estate has been divided. There wa3
a sister, Margaret, who died in England. A
search has been made for her children, whether
successful or not I. cannot say. There is a.
legal contest going- on in Queensland to coi
led an Inheritance tax from this estate, tne
authorities of Queensland claiming that Ty
son was a resident of that state. There is no
chance for any persons to obtain any share
now In the above npmed estate unless they
can show that they are descendants of the de
ceased Margaret."
AUSTIN', Texas, Oct. 4.â Some time ago
published notice wrs made in this country that
James Tyson had died In Australia, having an
estate of several million dollars which was
held there awaiting legal claimants. . A larga
number of Texas people who could trace their
kinship to the deceased millionaire formed an
organization with a view of pressing their
claims for shares of the fortune.

OP INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Its policy will be to place the price m
the Kern River field at least as high as 50
cents.- Should that price be established
and a pipe line be laid to San Francises
Bay, oil could probably be sold in San
Francisco for about $1.
The combine will control from 65 per
cent upward of the output of the Kern
River field, while of the remainder a con
siderable proportion is contracted for a
series of years, leaving but a small per
centage outside of the combine free to en
ter Into competition in the markets. It i3
consequently believed that the combine
will be able to control the price of oil up
to a certain point.
The committee appointed to appraise
the assets of the various companies has
reached an agreement, and its report is
acceptable to the leading stockholders and
officers of the larger comi>anies.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 4.-The great com
bination of Kern River oil companies is
about to be consummated, and the ques
tion of entering the combine. Involving a
total capital of ((0,000,000, will be submit
ted to the stockholders of the various
companies operating in that -field within a
week or ten days.
Report of Appraisers Acceptable to

Persistent reports have been current
for four days to the effect that President
Castro's Venezuelan forces at Tachirj.

rout. Five Venezuelan battalions of 4:ej
men each were engaged and the Colom
bians are estimated at the same number.
General Echeverria was killed on the bat
ticneld and not shot by the Colombians.
After Echeverria was killed Generals Da
vila, Clodomlro Castillo and Emllio Cas
tro, a brother of President Castro, fled
from the field". Another battalion then
broke. ' The three remaining battalions
kept up the fighting until routed. About
600 were killed on the Venezuelan side, in
cluding thirty minor officers. The In
dians ambushed General Davilas' retreat
ing vanguard, composed or 200 men, and
annihilated it."
It is reported that Mendoza, President
Castro's Minister of Finance, was shot at
at Caracas October 1 by a would-be as
sassin who missed him.

ASKS LEGAL AID
"Warrant Out for Arrest
of Woman and Real
Estate Man.
C. F. Henry, who until a few days ago
was the proprietor of the Audubon Hotel
at 1105 Hyde street, secured a warrant
from Judge Fritz yesterday for the ar
rest of Mrs. Minnie Leslie, alias Ellis,
alias Henry, and Henry F. Kredo, real
estate agent in the Flood building, on the
charge of felony embezzlement. It Is al
leged that the woman and Kredo have
left the city- together and Detective Cody
has been detailed by Captain Seymour to
discover their whereabouts.
The woman was employed as house
keeper by Henry and called herself Mrs.
Henry. Henry left for a trip East Sep
tember 5, and as he wanted to sell out he
placed the matter In Kredo's hands, fix
ing his price at $4500. He had asked that
sum from Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert, who came
from the country, and were anxious to
purchase.
Henry returned from the East last "Wed
nesday and found Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert
in, possession of the hotel. They explain
ed that last Saturday they bought the
premises through Kredo from Mrs. Henry,
who alleged that she was Henry's wife,
for $3500. Henry made an investigation
and discovered that the woman and her
two children left the hotel early Sunday
morning and that Kredo disappeared at
the same time. Henry declares that the
woman had no authority whatever to sell
the property and will commence a civil
suit to-day to recover it. The loss will
fall upon Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert, who. are
innocent dupes of the woman and Kredo.

It's an easy matter for a married mar
to get next to the latest word in use.
The statement of Mme. Le Gonidec that
Mr. Metcalf nad not accounted to her
was true, for Mr. Metcalf. as executor of
the estate, was obliged to account only
to the estate, and has accounted to the
estate for the proceeds of the sale, and if
Mme. Le Gonidec wins her case against
the estate the money is there for her.
Mr. Metcalf charges himself with $95,
054 14 collected. Of that amount $79,999 95
has been paid by him to the heirs under
orders of partial distribution already
made In the estate. The account shows
other expenditures, and that there Is a
balance of raors than $11,000 to met the
expenses of administration.
Mr. Metcalf, having no evidence of the
right of Mme. Le Gonidec to the money,
and not knowing anything at all about
the alleged purchase of the stock by Mme.
Le Gonidec, as executor of the estate of
the deceased of course had to reject the
claim, and it is upon that rejected claim,
as executor, that the suit was brought.
Partial Distribution of Estate.
Miss Mary Marjraret Isabella Murphy
subscribed for $5000 of the stock of thjg
Ban Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railway Compary. Victor H. Metcalf was
the attorney in fact for Miss Murphy at
that time. After Miss Murphy's death
Mme. Le Gonidec claimed that she had
purchased the stock from her sister and
demanded from Mr. Metcalf, the executor
of Mary Margaret Isabella Murphy, the
$5000 received by him from the sale of that
stock.
The estate is a valuable one. The
amounts collected, in addition to the ap
praisement, show the estate to be worth
over $400,000. The principal asset is a
five-twenty-fourths interest in the build
ing at the corner of Market, McAllister
and Jones streets, where J. J. O'Brien
formerly had his place of business.
An examination of the report explains
the suit brought by Frances J. Le Goni
dec against Victor H. Metcalf, concerning
which &uit ThÂ»* Call wishes to correct an
erroneous statement made at the time of
the filing of that complaint reflecting upon
Mr. Metcalf.
Estate Is Very Valuable.
Victor H. Metcalf, as executor of: the
estate of Mary Margaret Isabella Mur
phy, deceased, filed his final account and
report yesterday afternoon. The report
is an interesting one, showing the amount
of work dene in the estate and the com
plications which have existed over the
probate of the will. It was claimed that
there were three. wills of different dates,
in all of which Mr. Metcalf was named
as the executor. The papers in the estate
show that the different wills made differ
ent dispositions of the property. The va
rious heirs of the deceased, after nego
tiations extending over two years, ad-
Justed their various claims to the estate.
The first will filed by Mr. Metcalf was
then admitted to probate. The relatives
of the deceased share in the estate as fol
lows:
Mme. de Dominguez. thirteen forty
eighths; Mme. Le Gonldec. thirteen forty
elgrhths; Daniel T. Murphy, eleven forty
eighths; Anna T. Wolseley, eleven ninety
sixths, and the two minor children of the
deceased brother each. receive eleven one
hundred-and-iiiriety-seconds.
General W. H. L. Barnes, whom Da
voust had declared to be a leader in the
movement,, sent a communication to the
Press Club board of managers and also
appeared before them in person. He said
that he had been approached by Davoust,
and after the latter's scheme was unfold
ed had scented trickery and absolutely
refused to permit his name to be used
unless he received authentic assurance
from the officers of the club that the
proposition was bona fide. When the gen
eral was told that Davoust had put him
forward as a prime mover in the "bene
fit" plan and that he had even been de
clared to have suggested . that Davoust
and his associates should get 25 per cent
of the gross proceeds for their efforts m
promoting The affair he denounced the
schemer in emphatic language.
John P. Gallagher also appeared before
the board, and others on Davoust's "com
mittee" sent communications in effect
similar to that of General Barnes.
Having heard these statements the club
managers summoned Davoust before
them, presumably to have him explain
his plans more fully. He was led on by
questioning until the full details of his
nefarious project were- laid bare. Then
he was Informed of the result of the
club's Investigation and in a way that al
most took his breath away. President
Stover gave warning that any further at
tempt on his part to make use of the
club name would be prosecuted, and called
upon the steward to show the "grafter"
to the door.
Davoust was well equipped with sta
tionery bearing the names of prominent
men as his associates in the "benefit"
project. It is understood, that he is at
tempting to interest other clubs in simi
lar schemes in connection with the Mc-
Kinley monument fund.
General Barnes Indignant.
Martial Davoust called upon the officers
of the Press Club on Wednesday. He
claimed to represent a committee cf citi
zens Â¦ including- in its membership such
well known men as I. J. Truman, General
Barnes, G. H. Umbsen, Major Hooper,
John P. Gallagher and a number of oth
ers. This committee, he explained, had
started a movement for a benelit to swell
the monument fund, which it desired to
give under the auspices of some reputable
club, which should lend its name -to the
affair and have charge of the financial
end. Davoust was told that the Press
Club would consider the matter and give
him an answer on Friday. .
An investigation was at once instituted,
and the alleged members of Davousfs
committee were communicated with,
the result b_eing about what the Press
Club officers had surmised. It was found
that Davoust had induced citizens to en
ter into his plans by claiming to represent
the Press Club : and then had sought to
interest the club by posing as the repre
sentative of the citizens' committee.
Seeking to profit by the national grief
over the death of President McKinley,
the so-called "charity benefit promoters"
are abroad In the city. One of them came
to grief yesterday in an effort to inveigle
a number of prominent citizens into a
scheme whereby he . and his confederates
could "work" the city for contributions
toward the McKinley monument fund. He
made a mistake by attempting to make
use of the Press Club, many of whose
members are familiar with the records of
his ilk.

The Franciscan fathers in. charge of St.
Anthony's Church yesterday celebrated
the feast of St. Francis of Assissium,
their founder, after whom the city of
San Francisco is named. The date is In
timately connected with the history. 'of
San Francisco, for in 1776 the first church
at the Presidio of San Francisco was ded
icated on the feast day. The services
consisted of a solemn high mass and a
sermon by Rev. Father Sesnon of San
Rafael, who spoke in part as follows:
. If there were charity in our hearts, would
we have read of the assassination of our dear
President? What led on to it? The want of
charity and the love of our neighbor. Let us
pray to-day that good St. Francis will ask
Almighty God for a censorship of the. press
so that we need not read of so much vituper
ation and so much fighting and scandal. It
seems as if when people have troubles to-day
they rush to the press and think they can get
their revenge that way. If the good St. Fran
cis were to appear on Market street to-day and
on the water front, he would say: "Go, boys,
and make up. Look" at the life of Him who
died on the cross for . ub and try to make ! up
and don't stain our beautiful town with sucn
deeds as have taken place. Not violence, not
vituperation, not calumny to arouse ' the pas
sions of men did St. Francis teach, but he
taught them the -way to Almighty God.. Let
me say this: Oh, if we could. only have a spark
of the love of Christ in our hearts, . the love
which filled the heart of St. Francis, then
the world would j be changed. Our ' beautiful
city, which is the pride of the coast and of
the United States, would then be a Christian
and a perfect city because the reign of Christ
would prevail. : Christ â¢ would be known ; and
loved and the * enemies of menâ the flesh ' and
the devilâ would be put down."
Franciscan Fathers Celebrate the An
niversary of the Feast of the
Founder of the Order.
I am much pleased with the outlook. The
teamsters are satisfied with conditions such as
they are, and are accepting | them unhesita
tingly. I believe that the peace will be a
lasting- one. Both sides have suffered greatly,
but the hatchet is buried now, and confidence
between the teamsters and draymen Is again
restored. Speaking for the draymen, I will
ray that they are willing- to forget the past;
and they look to the . developments of . the
future with confidence. Before a week has
passed everything will be working? ( smoothly

THE CITY'S PATRON SAINT
Manager George Renner of the Dray
men's Association made the following
statement yesterday:
The total number of teams in the city
aggregates about 1200. With 500 teamsters
given places yesterday and nearly. 300 non
union men still employed, places for 400
more teamsters remain to be filled. Many
of the larger firms sent the greater num
bers of their horses to the country at the
beginning of the strike, and as soon as
these are returned to the city they will
put on more men and run at their full
capacity.
The scenes about the various stables
yesterday were gratifying to employers
as well as the teamsters tnemselves. The
men were ready to resume their long in
terrupted labor, and for the first time the
non-union teamsters approached the old
time strikers without tear of being at
tacked. A few of the non-union team
sters in the employ of Farnsworth .&
ttuggles were timid of going Into the
streets without police escorts, and in or
der to satisfy them several police .were
sent out with them. No other instance
of the use of police on trucks during the
day was reported.
The numbers of union teamsters rein
stated in their positions yesterday, by, the
larger firms are as follows:
McNab &; Smith 40, Farnsworth & Rug
gles 30, Stetson & Renner 22, 'Western
freight and Transfer Company 20, Mor
ton Drayag* Company 10, Englander

Company 10, M. Burns & Co. 6, J. S. Ja
cobs Company 10, Overland Freight Trans
fer Company 30.
Few Specials Employed.
It was an extremely lively day in dray
ing and teaming circles. For the first
time in many weeks the wheels of trucks
which had grown rusty for want of use
were greased and the vehicles placed in
commission. Teamsters who had. been
upon a more or less enforced holiday for
a corresponding period vaulted into their
seats witn aiacruy, and witn a cracking
or whiplashes which resemDied artillery
In action entered upon the discharge of
tneir auty.
.from leiiable figures gathered at the
headquarters of me Draymen's "Associa
tion auring the day it is Known that fully
500 teamsters, or tx> per cent of tne total
union membership, were reinstated in
tneir old positions. Many will be disap
pointed because of tne employment of
non-union men, whom the larger dray
men decline to discnarge in order to give
tne old teamsters tneir places. There w
some grumDling at this, DUt the men are
accepting the situation philosopnicaiiy
and little friction has developed. All In
all, the developments of the day were sat
isfactory to an concerned. . â¢Â¦
There are 240 araying firms connected
with the Draymen's Association. Of tills
number less than twenty ttrms employ
more than twenty men. The firm having
the greatest number, of teams is McNao
& Smith, they having 115 trucks engaged
in the draying business. Over 2W draymen
employ from one to ten men, while twenty
employ from ten to twenty, teamsters.. In
tne cases of the smaller draymen nearly
all reinstated their > teamsters yesterday
morning. According to reports from these
draymen, some 350 teamsters were given
places on trucks. Among the larger con
cerns the percentage ot non-union men
still employed ranges from 31) to 50. Many
of these men, however, are from the
country and came here to work during
the pendency of the strike in order to lay
aside a "stake" for the winter. While
many of them will remain in their posi
tions, it is estimated that fully one-half
will gradually give up their positions and
return home. As these vacancies occur
they will naturally be filled by the ap
pointment of union men.
terms of ' the - agreement were
taken quietly and in good spirit. Both
teamsters and water front laborers ap
plied for work, and where it; was ; given
them they took their places by the side
of non-union men without protest.. .-'

hold the men in line- were suc
cessful, yesterday, and the first

So far the members of the union stand
firm." The ; non-union- men engaged dur
ing the. strike have proved satisfactory
and none of the contractors are idle on
account of the union's stand. This mat
ter of the, foreman is the only question in
volved. Wages and hours are up to union
requirements 'and up to the time of the
strike union labor was given the prefer
ence.
The pile drivers and bridge builders who
struck in 'sympathy -with the teamsters
have so' far refused to return to work.
The contractors insist that the regular
foremen shall not be members of the un
ion. They take the stand that as a' fore
man is the direct representative of the
employer it is not right that he should
divide with any union the allegiance he
owes the man he represents..
Contractors Insist on Having Non-
Union Foremen.

; The strike leaders now believe that they
have got all the water front unions in
lino with the terms ' of the settlement.
The longshoremen met last night at the
sailors' headquarters on East street.
From the dissatisfaction openly expressed
by members, of the union since peace was
declared fears were entertained that this
.organization would break away from, the
federation and the peace compact.
Andrew Furuseth and Rev. Peter C.
Yorke talked to the men at some length
and' succeeded in persuading . them that
the settlement was for their own best.in
terests. When the meeting adjourned the
men dispersed to their homes apparently
well satisfied that within a week or so
they would; all be Â¦ back at work again.
With. all the union's in line, the leaders
now . express , themselves as -confident of a
speedy return to the old conditions.

tion it "was before "the-" strike. ' â¢
- For marine firemen there . Is little de
mand. The Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany, with which the firemen broke their
contract, is the only line of any conse
quence that employed union firemen ex- '
clusively and for the present the Pacific
Coast steamers are fully equipped in this
respect. ' In addition to the union firemen
now on the beach there is a number of
firemen, jwho,. while not members of the
union, were paid by the union to refrain
from, working during the " strike." These
men and the men at present employed
will have equal chances with the. union
men for such vacancies as present them
selves.
This condition of affairs and their in
ability to secure immediate work caused
considerable uneasiness in the ranks of
the union firemen. <They called a meet
ing yesterday morning and it took all the
persuasive powers of the strike leaders to
induce them to keep faith with the terms
of the settlement.
The boarding houses established on the
various docks will probably be abandoned
by;the end of the week. A number of un
ion men will probably be engaged upon
application this morning to work at dis
charging the , Umatilla. The " Mariposa,
which arrives '.on the 9th, and the Ala
meda, which sails October 12, will afford
openings for the return to work of a
number of union men. There will also be
work for I some of them on the Pacific
Mail dock during next week.
Those. union men that have gone'to work
have been given to understand clearly
that no hazing of non-union laborers will
be tolerated. The . Pacific Coast Com
pany took . back several union coal team
sters. All of them were told plainly that
any Interference, by act or word, with
their non-union fellow workers would be
considered cause for instant dismissal.
C. A. McPhee, the lumber stevedore,
yesterday discharged a union longshore
man for, attempting to put a non-union
man out of business with a piece of scant
ling. The union man, a big scantling in
his hand, rushed across the wharf and in
stead of. piling lumber in the proper place
threw it with considerable violence to
ward where a non-union man was work
ing. The non-union man saved himself a
broken leg by jumping. McPhee witness
ed the incident and discharged the union
man on the spot.
Andrew Furuseth said yesterday- that
things were going as well as could be ex
pected; that quite a number of union sail
ors had been shipped, and that the pros
pects were good for finding work for all
in a short time. . .-. Â¦
TO RAISE THE BOYCOTT.
Executive Committee of Labor Coun
- cil Recommends That Course. ,
The San Francisco Labor Council met
in executive session last night and for
several hours considered the report of the
executive committee recommending the
raising of the boycott previously declared
on account of conditions growing out of
the strike.
The recommendation- met with some op
position by certain delegates, who advised
that action be deferred until all the final
arrangements in the matter of the settle
ment of the strike were completed. A
motion to postpone action until the next
meeting prevailed.
Various reports of delegates tending to
show that, the local unions were in sym
pathy with the machinists in their strike
for nine hours were received.
. The announcement was made that a pic
nic would be held at Shell Mound Park
on October 20,- the proceeds to be devoted
to the machinists' strike fund.
