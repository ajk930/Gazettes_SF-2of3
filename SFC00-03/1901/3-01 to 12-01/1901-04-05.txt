Developments came thick and fast dur

went Ceeper It was developed that suc
cessful assaults bad been made upon the
city treasury and that orders had been
cashed there by Deputy Treasurer Rels the
signatures to which tbe veriest tyro in the
basllng business would have recognized
as forgeries. Treasurer Brooks recognizes
his anomalous' position In tbe matter and
U sparring for time In which to'leam Just
bow much money he will have to pay on
the bogus orders that Deputy Rels has
cashed.

One of these orders, on which Sullivan
obtained Â£00 and which was paid by Rels,
was In -the case of Isaac Kcmppo Jr.,
charged with obtaining eoods. by false
ITetenses. Tbe case Is in Judge Mogan's
court and etill pendlns, yet on March .18
the meney was paid out by Rels on an
crder purporting to have been signed by
Police Judge Mogan, and was drawn on
that date by Sullivan, whu signed for the
amount. The discovery was made by
Kemppe's attorney when he attempted to
eubstitute bona* In lieu of the money de
posited. Rels was duly shocked when the
signature was pronounced a forgery by
Expert Kytka. Now Treasurer Brooks Is
guessing how many more of these bogus
orders have been cashed by his careless
paying teller. ;Â¦ \ Â¦

Wood regarding the PJatt amendment.
General Wood taid that the United State*
Government intended to deal Justly by the
Cubans and had no desire to retain pos
session of the Island. He pointed out that
the Platt amendment was drawn pri
marily with the view to protecting a weak
nation against outsiders, as well as
agnlnst Internal strife, and would not In
terfere with Cuban independence. He ex
plained that the Washington interpreta
tion of clause 8 of thÂ«f scheme of rela
tions was that the 'United States claims
the right to Intervene solely for the pur
pose of preserving the Independence of the
Island, maintaining an adequate force to
protect life, property and individual lib
erty and completing the obligations Im
posed by the treaty of Paris upon. the
United States. Ho expressed the opinion
that in drawing up Â« treaty many points
In the future relations of Cuba with the

WASHINGTON. April 4.âThe.prospec
! tive reduction of the United States naval
force on the Asiatic station Is beginning
to 'assume definite form, but thus far the
matter has not been considered by the
President nor 'has Secretary Long had an
opportunity to confer with Rear Admiral
Remey. But the naval bureau of naviga
tion, which has charge, of the assignment
of ships to. the various stations, has pro
posed that, there be a reduction of the
force from the Asiatic station. This has :
been baaed on a recommendation of the
needs of the navy and without reference
to any of the political questions involved.
Should It be decided to reduce the force
the homeward movement of vessels would
probably not begin before summer.-
As yet no consideration has been* given
to the disposition of the ships when they
are relieved from service in the Far East.
It Is said, however, that the North Atlan
tic squadron will be augmented by at least
one or two ships, while the South Atlantic
and. Pad fie stations also wilt be < rein
forced. Quite a number of ships will have
'to go .out of- commission, as they have
seen Ions service in .tropical waters and
will need a pretty general overhauling.

N. W..' WASHINGTON. April 4.-
President McKluley had a hearty
laugh to-day at the reports com
ing from Manila that he Is. about
to extend an invitation to Emillo Agulc
aldo to vtelt the United States. It wa*
safd to-day that Aguinaldo may visit the
United States some Jme In the near fu
ture, but at his own expense t-nd when he
has ceased to be a prisoner of "war.
The question as to what shall be done
with the Filipino leader and what shall be
the size, of the regular army seem to be
going hand in hand. No decision can be
reached as to. Aguinaldo' s future until it
is known what he can accomplish in the
way of pacifying the islands. No figurei
as to the size of the army can be given
until the effect of the caoture of the Fil
ipino leader and his Influence with the In
surgents under arm* can be correctly
gauged. Â¦ Â¦â¢â¢' t
A member of the Cabinet said to-day:
"There is no intention on the part of
this Government i to bring Agulnaldo .to
the United States. I do not know where
the impression originated that, Agulnaldo
was to be summoned to this country. Ho
is. regarded at -present as a prisoner of

be due to the present ostentatious expend*

There Is no doubt that the affection
from which the Premier Is suffering is
more serious than Is shown bv the medl

temporarily held In Check* by the opera

Owing to the Premier's Illness Presi

foundered . off San Francisco- Bay Febru

The report, just received by Mr. Klmball
completely exonerates Surfman Elllngseh

"It is proved beyond question," says the
report, "that, at no time was any ' signal
made by the steamer entitled to be rec
ognized as a signal 'of distress. The al
leged confession {of Surfman Ellingsan
that he. heard' signals of distress seems tc

The news contained In the foregoing

the testimony given at the various inves

During the investigation conducted by
Superintendent Blakeney Into the conduct
of Surf man EHlngsen testimony was pre
sented by â¢ surviving 1 , officers of the Rio
and by soldiers stationed at the Presld.'o
that distress whistles were continually
sounded when the ship struck.
Much of the Important testimony was
stricken out by Blakeney's orders and the
report waa nent on to' Washington. Tnj
report did not contain a single word pf
the statements made by Blakeney in

Ward McAllister, attorney for the Pa

last avening and he denounced the exon
eration of BUingsen as an outrage.
"It was bad enough." he said, for the
accident to have happened, but in the
face of what took place afterward tha
loss of life was Increased by tho neglect
of the life-saving lookout. The disgrace
that would have attended the conviction
of EllingHen for neglect of duty wÂ«"M
have been visited on him alone. This
finding Is a disgrace to the entire life
saving service." . â. .
It^ls understood that an appeal will bÂ«
made to the Secretary of the Treasury
asking that a thorough investigation be
made, not only of the Rio de Janeiro dls
nstef. but also of the manner in which
the inquiry Vas conducted and the gen
eral management of the life-saving de
partment ln^Callfornia.
1 Â¦ 'Attorney "Moore for 'the defense had
asked that when the heating closed, for
the day It be. not resumed until Tuesday.
Justice Jerome seemed willing and then
added:* Â¦:>â¢ .--. .
- "It Is necessary that Jones' testimony as
to this murder should, be corroborated. He
being a self-confessed accomplice, bis tes
timony alone fs not enqugh upon which
to hold Patrick.'/
Attorney Moore tersely added to this:
"We understand. that.*, and we suppose the
District Attorney- does, too."
"To-night those 'who are watching the
case closely are wondering what corrobo
rative testimony the State will introduce
to sustain the claims of Jones. Â¦
The other Incident brought out in the
clearest light the iriaomltable nerve/ of
.Patrick. In the face of the reiterated
story* of Jones that Patrick had instigated
the forgeries -and the actual murder, the
latter. took his place in the court proceed
ings with the utmost nonchalance. .
At one period It became necessary that
a statement : made by Jones be read, and
it was given Into the hands of one of the
counsel for the defense for that purpose.
This was the statement in which the valet
claimed Patrick killed Rice, and which he
has since denied. The reader hesitated
and stumbled over the written words.
', Suddenly Patrick spoke up, exclaiming:
"Here, I guess 1 can make it out; I'll read
it."
This was agreed to. and in a loud, clear
voice he read: "'P.' got a towel and
'sponge and saturated the sponge with a
colorless liquid he had in a bottle. Then
he went into the room where 'R.' lay in
bed. ~ I (Jones) was not- In tho room, but
opened the door and peeped in. . *P.* was
standing over.'R. 1 - with -the cone-shaped
towel in his hand, and he pressed it down
over 'R/b* face." â¢â¢ . ;_ '
Patrick was rttll reading, with no show
of emotion, when Justice Jerome ordered
a recess for lunch. 'The. P*s and R's In
the statement stand for Patrick and Rice.
At another point in the proceedings Jus
tice Jerbme gave his estimate .of Jones
.wlth,> characteristic iterseneas. Attorney
Moore had been raking the witness with
questions, all tending to bring out the
valet's lying propensities. He showed
that Jones had -lied -to and deceived his
own father when the latter called on him
in the hospital after he had attempted
suicide; that he had" told untruths to As
sistant District Attorney Osborne. and
that he had lied to his own counsel. Hers
Justice Jerome struck in with the remark:
"This witness Is a *reak. wicked and un
fortunate man. He is a self-confessed
murderer -and deserves contempt, but I
won't allow you to Insult him."

least two incidents during to-day's cross
examination of Charles F. Jones, the
valet 1 and secretary of Millionaire William
Marsh Rice, which rose above the ordin

Jerqme, who presides at the hearing, and
which probably shows why Lawyer Pat

Dlchs and Gibson were in town Sunday
and were seen to leave about 4 o'clock
In the afternoon. They returned In the
evening and were again seen about 8:3)
o'clock. They both deny having been in
town in the evening, but the officers have
proof positive that they were there. At
that hour Dlchs was sitting in . Kd La
hey's saloon and Gibson came to the door
and called him out. They were not seen
again that evening. Anderson left town
to return to the Taylor ranch about 9:39
o'clock. The supposition Is that Dlchs
and Gibson went ahead Â«nn waylaid An
derson on tho road near where tho body
was found.
The appearance of Anderson's head In
dicated that the blows were Inflicted with
a blunt Instrument, either a hammer or
a hatchet. On the sheep ranch a hatchet,

him and kicked him in the face, bruising
him considerably. Since that time Dlchs
had a feeling of great hatred toward An

threatened to get even with him. 8everai
days ago he boasted that before long he
would bruise Anderson's .face worse than
his own was bruised by Anderson during
the flght.
When arrested the two men were in a
cabin on the Glide ranch, and were not
aware of the presence of any one unitl
the officers appeared at the door. Realiz
ing that resistance would be useless, they
both quietly submitted to arrest. When
taken hold of by one of the officers and
before being told what he wax arrested
for Dlchs exclaimed. "I never killed that
fellow." He almost collapsed, but soon
recovered nis composure. Oibson seemed
cool from the first. He had on him a re

SUISUN, April 4.â The mystery sur
rounding the death of Albert Anderson,
who was atrociously killed on the Solano
County side of Putah Creek, near Win
ters, last Sunday evening, will undoubt
edly be cleared as a result of two arrests
mado to-day. The men who were taken
into custody are Edward Dlchs and
George Gibson. They were arrested on
the Glide sheep ranch, about five miles
northwest of winters. The arresting
officers were Sheriff George H. Savage and
Constables Charles H. Downing and Jo
seph Stoten of Solano County and Deputy
Sheriff Warden. Marshal Anderson and
Constable Wammuth of Yolo County.
Albert â¢ Anderson.- the murdered man,
was In Winters last Sunday evening, leav
ing that town for the ranch of Colonel
Samuel Taylor, at which place he was
employed. The following morning his
dead body was found on the bank of Pvi
tah Creek, the appearance" of his face
and head indicating, that his death had
been caused by blows with a blunt instru
ment. His head was literally crushed to
pieces. Sheriff Savage was at once not!-,
tied and a thorough investigation was be
gun, resulting in the arrests made to-day.
The officers feel confident that they- have
arrested the murderers of Anderson, as
the evidence they secured previous to
making the arrests , warranted them In
taking this step.

LONDON. April 4.â The Echo saya' it
understands that In consequence of cer
tain unpleasant rumors. Lady Cook,
widow of Sir Francis Cook and formerly
Tennle C. Claflln, V has -applied to the
Home Secretary to have the body of Sir'
Francis exhumed. Sir Francis Cook died
February 17. ', ' *, â¢â¢
Friends of Lady Cook say that false
stories have been circulated by a person
not related to Sir Francis, but who was
disappointed at not being. remembered in
the will. Lady Cook desires that the ex
act cause of her husband's death, which
wan senile decay (he was 84 years old at
the lime of his death), shall be officially
certified to, so that hereafter, In the event
of her death, nothing can be Alleged
against her.' The relations between Lady
Cock and her late husband's family are
quite cordial. Lady Cook, who is living
in Kf n.Â«lngton, London, made the follow
ing statement to a correspondent this
evening: ,
Sine* the' death of Â¦ my husband there has
come to my knowledge a very thoroughly laid
plan, ' concoctod before his death.' to attack
his reputation for the purpose of blackmail.
It waa about to be put Into execution when he
died. Â¦ . Â¦ : .
Home parties to the. conspiracy expected to
secure large amounta of | money during I his
life. -His somewhat sudden end prevented a
fulfillment of. these hopes. The consplracy
reached a culmination hy thÂ« circulation of
rumors that Sir Francis died an.. unnatural
'death and owed his demise to me, the con
spirators hoping In' this fashion to black
mall me. * .- 'Â¦Â¦;Â¦Â¦ ",< V â¢
Had I not been a woman of world-wide repu

calumnies die. My own. health -also Is ex

SUREL.Y no fault could be found
with the performance of Articulate
in the seven furlong handicap at
Tanforan yesterday. The game
brown three-year-old conceded
nine pounds'to so'good a veteran as Vul
cain und In a drive that called for stam
ina and pluck beat Hlldreth's horse half
a length. The race was decided .over a
track slow and dead,' which accounts for
the time made. In the butting Ar
ticulate, with T>omlnick in the saddlo, had
the call at odds of 6 to o. Astor, ridden
by Mounce. came next In demand, then
Vulcaln. Unable to wait after the etart,
Dominlck oti the choice set a clip out in
front bound to make something snap.
Straightened for home, with Vulcain clos
ing fast, it looked as it thef three-year-old
himself must go, for Vulcain. once got his
head In front und the result looKed in
doubt. Then drawing his whip Dominlck
struck the brown coit but atfew times,
when he again forged to the front, down
ing the older horse, drawing away.
Dandy Jim, after a stormy passage, iln
ished third. Astor had '-speed for a panel
or so, then quietly took his chulr.

JEFFRIES AND
RUHLIN AGAIN
NEW JTORK. April 4.â The ahoot for the
Grand American handicap, which was
postponed yesterday, began this morning
and was ' continued until dusk this even
ing. With the oxcoptton of a brief Inter
val, in the middle of the day shooting at
live birds was kopt up without any inter
ruption and nearly 6000 birds were trapped.
The weather conditions were anything
but conducive to the comfort of the grun
ners. Two hundred and one of them tried
conclusions for championship honors. Din
ing: the entire shoot rain fell continuously
and this made what would otherwise have
been fast Hydra very slow birds indeed.
Their wing and. tail featherB were thor
oughly soaked with the rain and the birds,
which were specially, picked for- this oc
casion, were Â« for the most, part ear
marks. However, there. were occasional
exceptions, when some, very tricky
pigeons flew from the traps as swiftly as
snipe and in some instances while on the
wine: they went in such a zigzag fashion
that they evaded the efforts of the expeits
to i; rasa them. .
All told there were 222 entries for the
event, ten of which were post entries.
TWenty-one men failed to toe the mark
when their turns camo and these ab
sentees forfeited 110 each; all of which
went to swell the nurse. The cntlio
amount of money "which will be distrib
uted among the fifty-four hlg-h nuns when
the event Is concluded to-morrow Is $535.
When the shooting was discontinued thU
evening there, were forty men with
straight scores of - twenty kills each, Â¦ as

noon recess six jurors were secured. In
the afternoon five jurors were. added, and
It was hoped that the entire jury would be
secured when court adjourned. AH the

man replied that be knew the Assistant
District Attorney. . .
"You mean Grady." said Foote.
In an Instant Greany was on his feet
and glowering at Foote. and said: â¢
"I wish you would address me by my
proper name. Mr. Feet." and then both
counsel joined In a laugh.
Glaze frequently consulted with his at
torneys, and when he did not like the ap
pearance of a trial Juror Foote or Pelxotto
would exercise peremptory' challenges,
getting rid of ten Jurors In this manner.
The prosecution used the same privilege
(n two cases, the rest of tho panel being
challenged and excused for cause. The
principal reasons for excusing them were
"llxed opinions ns to the case" and "oppo
sition to the death penalty for murder.
Robert E. Glaze, the hotel. proprietor,
who shot and killed his partner. William
Trewhella. at Â»he Windsor Hotel In Janu

Court. â¢ -. .V: ..'Â¦Â¦:. Â¦' Â¦'â¢ -.'- Â¦:Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦- Â¦.Â¦>.'Â¦'"': :.'-Â¦
The accused man was brought to the
courtroom from the prison at the Hall of
Justice and was closely guarded by two
deputy sheriffs. In the courtroom , the
wife and stepchildren of Glaze awaited
him- and gave affectionate greetings to
the man 'accused of the crime of murder.
Glaze presented his usual natty appear
ance, but its face showed by its pallor the
effects of confinement In the prison. .
Attorneys W. W. Foote and Edgar D.
Pelzotto appeared for Olaxe and the pros
ecution was represented by District At
torney Li. F. Bylngton and Assistant Dis
trict Attorney John T. Greany.
The mode of questioning of Jurors at the
hands of the defense indicates that Glaze
will plead that he killed Trewhella in self
defense. .
In addition to the usual questions sub
mitted to the Jurors tbo attorneys for

time' to collect his two fees of W""*;
for which ho has- made demand on the
board" Superlntendent'Webster said yes
terday that one of the fees was clearly Il
legal as the duties performed were In be
half of P. M. Welllnl inspector of repairs
to schoolhouse*. who sued : the SupeHn
tendent to compel him to sign his salary
demand for $30. Webster holds that the
Beard of Education was not concerned In
tho suit and had no right to engage an
attorney to defend one of its subordinates.
Webfcter will, therefore, refuse to sign
this demand. If the board should pass It.
on the ground that Denman Jr. must look
to Wcllln for hts compensation.
The other demand for 1600 Is for, defend
ing the suit brought by, Webster to deter
mino whether his deputy. -W.-.B. Kings
bury, has the right tp^represenV him at
the board's meeting. :?The aty Attorney
declined to conduct the case, so > Â¦ Den
mans son was pressed into service. While
the suit was won by the board In the Su
fcrlor Court. It is: now; on appeal before
th* Supreme Court, so Denraan's duties
are net yet completed. ;- ' '> ,o - -.'.-Â¦
" Webster regards Denman's employment
by the board in this case as legal, but he
bollevex ' that IWO for a ; small amount of
work - Is ~ exorbitant. He ! names | several
eminent? legal lights who would not ask
more , than"$150.?or similar . services. : He
will, therefore, decline to sign the de
mand unless it is shaved down to a sum

I>r Rowell's attention was to-night called to
thÂ« report emanating from Washington that he
la a candidate for the position of Minister to
Japan. In reply to a question he Â«ald; "I am
not a candldnte for any. office. There are. but
few offices I would accept. Friends of mine In
Washington have mentioned my name In con
nection with this position, but 1 have never
been a candidate." : : <-
The admirable tact displayed 'by Dr.
Rowell in responding to Tho Call's in
quiry suggests that he possesses special
attributes of diplomacy. It is well known
that Senators Perkins* and . Bard > have
more than once discussed the merits of
Dr. Rowell with reference to recommend
ing him to the President as the successor
to Alfred E. Buck of Georgia,- the present
United States Minister to Japan. .John
F. Swift of California was appointed to
that position by President Harrison, and
Frank Â¦ I*. S Copmbu subsequently., received
the honor of appointment to succeed Mr.
Swift. Years ago ' tho California . delega
tion in Congress convinced the appointing
power that the Pacific Coast was entitled
to eminent \ representation In I the i Orient;
but of late years tho coast has lost In
fluence In this direction. \ :..Â¦Â¦Â¦:
Dr. Rowell. while assorting that he Is
not a candidate, does not indicate that
he would decline the place If !t> were ten
dered him. He Is apprised ? of the fact
that his friends In Washington. are men
tioning his name ( In i connection )| with i the
high office, yet it does not appear that he
has advised them 'against- such , mention.
It might be better for the State If Dr.
Rowell would come out .and I define': his
position. A Callfornlan should bo ap
pointed to succeed Mr. Buck of Georgia,
There * are - reasons, commercial, i political
and geographical, why this State - should
be recognized. Tho Congressional delega
tion should agree on Dr. Rowell or some
other good man for the - placo. . c: , ;â¢
The genial Dr. Chester Rowell of Fres
no. State Senator and regent of the Uni
versity of California. Is mentioned for the
position of Minister Plenipotentiary and
Envoy Extraordinary to Japan. The fol
lowing dispatch from Fresno indicates the
doctor's attitude: ....

to San Francisco and subsequently ran
saloons at several places along. Kcarny

Cordes then sold his saloon and theÂ«r
bought five acres of land on Snell avenua
In Elmhurst. near the tian Lcandro roÂ«<l.
They built a pretty ..â¢nitac; home upon It
and started a chicken ranch. They owno rt
two horses, with buggy and wagon, and
several cows, and lived with all the com
forts afforded by countrv life.
But the resorts of the San Leandro roal
were near and they reminded Kitty con
stantly "f the gay dens of the Barbary
Coast. - The humdrum existence at thÂ«
cottnge became unbearable to her and last
January she left Cordes and returned to
the old life. She got employment as a
waitress at the dive known as Diana Hall,
at 502 Pacific street. Within a few dayÂ«
Olaf Olsen came along and since then
Kitty has cared no more for Cordes than
she did for the ranch life. Olsen Is a
sailor, who is just now at sea on a steam
schooner.
t Cordes often called to see the woman
and when he came Wednesday evening
about C o'clock nothing was thought of it.
During his short stay one of the women
called the woman "Kitty Cordes" and she
replied In his presence. "That's my name,
but when I change it ngaln It will oe

was going to sell the ;anch, the deeds of

It is easy to keep well If we would only
observe each day a few simple rules of
nealth. â¢
The all important thins Is to keep the
Ftomach right, and to do this it Is net
necÂ«^sary to diet or to follow a set rule
or bill of fare. Such pampering* simply
makes a capricious appetite and & feeling-
that certain favorite articles of food must
be avoided.
Professor Wiechold tfres pretty good
s.lvice on thl* subject. He says. "1 am
?'* years old and have never had a serious
illness, and at the same time my life has
rx>cn largely an Indoor one. but I early
discovered that the way to keep healtny
was to keep a healthy stomach, .not by
*-at!ng bran cracker* or dieting- of any
!=ort: en the contrary I always eat what
my arPÂ«tlte craves, but for the past eight
yean I have made It a dally practice to
take one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after each meal, and I attribute
my robust health for a man of my ajre
to the regular daffy use of Stuart's Tab-'
lets.
"My physician first advised me to use
â¢ them because he said they were pÂ«rf*ctly
harmless and were not a *ecret patent
medicine, but contained only the natural
digejtlx'es. peptones and diastase, and
after using them a few weeks I have
never ceased to thank him for his advice.
"I honestly belier*. the habit of taking:
Stuart's r>yspeps!a Tablet* after meals Is
the real health habit, because their use
brings health to the sick and ailing and
prÂ»servÂ£S health to the well and strong/'
Men and women past fifty year* of age
need a safe rtisr^Ftlve after meal* to Insure
a perfect digestion and to ward oft dls-
paÂ«. and the safest. be*t known and most
widely used Is Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
let*. Â¦-. Â¦ Â¦ ' Â¦ Â¦ - :
Thev are found In every well regulated
household from Main** to California, and
in Great Britain and Australia are rapidly
rtuEhin* their way Into popular favor. !
All drucrrists **H Stuart's Dvspepeta
Tablets, full sized packages at SO rent*,
and for a weak stomach a 50-cent package
will often do fifty dollars worth of Rood.

The colonel was an enthusiast in war with a fonJÂ«

pczce. His predictions of the future of the South have
more resemblance to the war whoop of a guerrilla
Icjdcr than to the sane estimates of a careful student
of social subjects. Thus he declares the "Real
South" is to be "far richer and more powerful than
thf- North." He adds: "In the days to come thi

the term says that up to this time the South has never

says the old wrappings have now been thrown off an J

A CHA17CE TO ffMTTVE!/
It is easy to sec that somc'of the rich Filipinos, or
especially the clergy, may have propagated such an
idea, the commission not being responsible. But,
even if this be so, the commission can do its "duty to
this country only by telling- the natives now the hard
but necessary truth that', their islands can never, be
States and they can never be citizens, r . ' Â¦
The Philippines will never be States, the Filipinos
will never be equal citizens of this country, , When
they learn this there will be another indignant out
break stung -Into being by what they will regard as a
breach of pledge and a violation of faith'.
We warn the commission to cleanse itself, of any
suspicion of responsibility for this double dealing.
Sp if this sudden access of Filipino loyalty, is pro
cured by any such promises, made or implied, it it but
the forerunner of more serious trouble than we have
seen there heretofore. â¢
This being so, the American people want no pro
jection of that policy into xhe operations of the civil
commission. The people are opposed to making
States out of those islands and bestowmenfof fellow
citizenship upon these people. To this they will never
assent. Every political party in this country is op
posed to it. The very work being done by the com
mission no*- should prove io every one that the com
mission is opposed to it. That body, has organized
the public schools on the basis of sectarian religious
teaching in the schools by the ministers of religion.
That will never be permitted in an American State. It
is repugnant to our ideas of religious liberty. Our
school system is secular, and 'when it ceases to be
secular it should be destroyed.
It is useless for Dcwty and the other parties to this
elaborate sy^tera of implications to deny now that they
had authority and merely baited the Filipinos wÂ«th
hope in order to get their help against the Spaniard*.
The issue is not wlut. they meant nor their motive,
but what tlie Filipinos Ixrlieved them to mean and the
mctive they thought inspired it. It is this Filipino in
terpretation of all this questionable diplomacy that
has caused more than two years of war and cost more
than two hundred 'millions of treasure.
This is what is needed in order that our home peo
ple may learn something about those possessions. At
present they have no knowledge that equips them for
judgment. If the Filipinos accept the civil government.
put over them by the commission and lay. down their
inns we will be brought nearer to the actual scene
of the problem we must solve and will see Its details
in all their naked vexation. But just as this pleasant
prospect pleases comes another and quite different
statement of the situation, which, if true, means that
th; past trouble will be as nothing compared to what
the future will bring. It is positively stated that-tht
action of the natives is influenced entirely by promises
made to them that if they â¢will take the oath of alle
giance they shall have statehood in the American
Union and share our birthright of American liberty.
Enough harm has been done already by promises,
actual or implied. Consnl Pralt admits that at^Singa
pore he promised Aguinaldo American alliance and
an independent Filipino government, and the late
Consul Wildman reported that he drew for Aguinaldo
at Hongkong the proclamatidn and scheme of govern
ment which the latter proclaimed in the islands, and
under which Wildmin declared he ruled with dignity
and justice for more tii^n a year. In addition to this,
Detvcy and Anderson both treated the Filipinos as
allies, ar.d our flagship ?2iutcd their flag.
. Â¦ - - 9
REPORTS from the Philippines for the last two
months have gratified our people by a prospect
of peace in the archipelago. It has been an
nounced by nearly every steamer and often by cable
that large numbers of the natives are taking the oath
of allegiance and settling down to peaceful vocations.
PACIFYING PROMISES.
Inventors were not natlsfled with propul
sion by steam on rails, and scores -of at
tempts were mede to apply steam power
to ordinary catrlages. The years near 1533
saw mnny strange vehicles of the nature
of automobiles running with more or less
rapidity, and generally very little else, on
our roads and streets. A .mucb j talked
about one called the Triumph Is here
shown from an old cut. Nor must we for
get the predecessor of the bicycle*, tho
.velocipede, which appeared under various
namesâ the dralsema being one. This ve
locipede had no propelling power other
than the rider'd feet.' but on level ground
or slightly downhill the rider could get
considerable speed. They were much used.
Charles 8umner !s remembered as riding
to - school upon i one. - I have seen three
diaries of Yale students in which they re
count with as much delight their triumphs
In velocipede riding as the undergraduate
of 1S05 took In bicycle- races.
Great was the talk about the new pro
pcltinft power. A popular song rcn: 2
"Oh dear! oh dtar! the truth I say
Something new Marts every day.
Steam for boiling, steam for baking. * * .
Steam for brewing and saumase-maklng.
fHeam to fire large balls and bullet*.
Steam to hatch out chickens and pullets.
Oh dear! oh- dear! thÂ« truth I say." 3 Â¦
Early Automobiles and Bicycles.
The use of pine wood as fuel necessi
tated the Invention of "spark arresters."
for. haystacks, barnc and buildings every
where alongside the railroad were set on
fire. Thcio ".tpark arresters" demanded
longer smokestacks, which .'were jointed
and had to be lowered frequently while
proceeding under bridge*. Many bridges
were patrolled by watchmen with buck
ets of water after the passing of each
train, and hogsheads filled with water
were kept at Intervals along the bridge?.
Borne bridgesâ among them the Schuylklll
bridge â enforced the stopping of locomo
tives, and the cars were drawn across the
bridge by horses to the other side, where
another locomotive took them on their
way.
Disadvantages of Floe Wood.

but at the end of the nrst. mile the um
brella covers were all burned off and each
man constantly watched his neighbor ana
whipped off fresh burning sparks.
As much previous notice, had been given
of the trip, hundreds, even thousands, of
teams had come even from great dis
tances, and crossroads and fields were
full of all sorts of conveyances, all stand
ing as near the rails as possible In order
to get a good view. A passenger. Judge
Glllls. says the' scene along the road was
Indescribable. Kvery horse wheeled in un
controllable fright, wagons and carriages
were upset everywhere; even oxen In carts
ran away. The train -proceeded amid
panic and destruction. ' The engine here
used was the De Witt Clinton, the third
locomotive built for actual service on a
railroad In America, the first and second
being the Best Friend and the West
Point, for the llttleh oiler called the Tom
Thumb could ncaiccly be called a locomo
tive. . . .
An amusing episode of the early days of
railroad experimenting '* shown In an old
print representing the race of Petur
Cooper's engine Tom Thumb with a horse
car. Peter Cooper owned much land near
Baltimore and he. believed the value of it
depended upon the success of tho Balti
more nnd Ohio Railroad, which was
deemed a failure by nianv on account of
the short curves on the road In the vleln
tty or Elllcot's Mills. A trial was made in
the summer of 1830. PetÂ«*r Cooper havlnar
Invited directors and friends. It was the
first journey In America by steam with an
American locomotive. Tho outward trip
was a great success-pelghtcen - miles an
hour. Gentlemen present wrote' in their
memorandum bonks with great solemnity
their names. and short sentences to provu
that even at that srreat velocltv It win
possible so to do. But on the way homÂ«
Tom Thumb and party met with a rebuff.
From the relay house two tracks had been
Inld back to town and when thev reached
this point there thev found another car
and a horse of great power and beauty

Kor years the railroads were a wonder
iÂ«rÂ«l a delight, which showed in many
simple expressions, not only of Individ
uals but associations. For instance, when
the Boston and Albany road was opened
In 1841 a party of gentlemen from New
HÂ« dfnrd hail spermaceti candles molded
one day, which they took on the trip and
burned at the banquet at Albany the suc
ceeding day. The Albanians would not

them a barrel of flour, made from wheat
which had been thrashed on Monday and
on tlic same day the wood of the barrel

day they all solemnly ate bread made
fri-m the flour.
How Some' Gentlemen Dined.
We bought some English locomotives
and Imported some ! English engineers.
th*n we built locomotives and the English
crgtneers pretended not to be able to run
them, but by that time we had plenty of
American engineers, and the Englishmen
si'uly went home. Â¦
Railroad. Nathan Hale, was an editor,
but he at once adapted himself; mechan
ics and schoolmasters became engineers
nnd surveyors: farmers turned "rail-car
roasters" â as the conductors were called
âstage drivers and hostlers became brake
men and depot masters, and all did It
easily and well, just as in tbe Revolution
booksellers and farmers and doctors be
came generals and colonels.
Notwithstanding the recent attainment of the long
desired competing railroad, California remains largely
dependent upon the Southern Pacific for transporta
tion, and it would have been injurious to the State
had its control passed wholly into the hands of East
ern men without a single Californian in the director
ate. The controlling interests in the road have recog
nized that fact and have acted wisely in giving Cali
fornia a representative; nor could they have chosen
one who would be more generally satisfactory to our
people than H. E. Huntington.
It is also fortunate for California that Mr. Hun
tiiigton is an easily approachable man. He does not
keep, himself shut a\vay from the people, On.lht
contrary, he is at all times accessible to those who wUh
to consult with him on matters 'of railroad traffic, and
he thus manages to keep in touch with the business
public and to learn the needs and the desires of the
producers, manufacturers and merchants. A repre
sentative of fliat character is doubly valuable, for he
will not only stand as a champion for our interests but
will be' at all times willing and able to learn how his
championship can be made more useful to our wel
fare.
Mr. Huntington is not only a resident of California,
but. he has long been identified with the railroad and
has a comprehensive knowledge of the mutual rela
tions between the State and the road, and is therefore
well fitted to counsel the board in all matters of policy
affecting our interests. His influence is bound to be
large, for no other among his colleagues has anything
like his extent of information concerning railroad
business on this coast.
/~* ALIFORNIANS, have reason to be gratified
( that in the newly elected board of directors of
the Southern Pacific Railway Company H. E.
Huntington has a place. His election assures to Cali
fornia a representative in the management of the road,
so that the direction of its policies- is not to be
wholly in the hands of men. residing on the other
side of the continent who have little direct interest in
California and hardly any knowledge of its conditions
and industries. ,

Famous Trip of the De "Witt Clinton.

This picture was sold'- in front of Inde

daily during the Philadelphia Centennial
exposition by two men dressed as Conti
nental soldiers. It was labeled incorrectly
as the first locomotive and train in Ameri

The cars on this train were the old coach
bodies; the. trucks were held together by
link chains and the locomotive in starting
took up the slack by jerks to the Intense
discomfort of the passengers. , Dry pitch

and sparks poured over the train. Many

,VTLâ THE FIRST AMERICAN RAILWAYS.
By Alio'e Morse Earle.
The Boston and Lowell, the Boston and
Providence and the Boston and "Worcesr
ter roads, were- completed at last and
opened with rejoicing. Gentlemen direc
tors, with flags ' and ' bands of music and
military corps would make ' the opening
trip, and while the husbands were eating
the banquet the ladles would be * given
a little turn on the road, "which they ap
peared to enjoy highly and with no signs
of fear." I have 'just read a letter writ
ten by a gentleman who drove with
friends to see the trial trip of locomotive
and cars on the Boston and Worcester
roatl. They had a terrible time; the
hordes ran away at the first 1 toot of the
engine and all were Injured. Not one at
the party 'eaw even a car, and the funniest
thine: of all wan the great surprise of
the narrator that the horses "were fright
ened." I should have thought any one
would know that' horses would certainly
be In an agony of fright at the unknown
monster. *
With the "uptaklng" qualities of all
true Americana, men now turned to. the

. AVe observe that several Eastern States have made
legislative appropriation's of $26,060 to $75,606, to col
lect,; install. arid explain. their exhibits there. The ex
position -will - not -only stimulate- reciprocal interstate
trade, but . will' doubtless produce a much needed re-
Vi val ; in our. trade with the other i Americas. \ ..We; are '
losing trade in Central and South America, It is no
answer* to this to point "out that it has not decreased.
To/ stand still is to. lose, for that population and its
heeds are increasing, and failure to get bur. share of
the increase -is a loss." - ? 'â¢'"' â¢ *Â» "*'
California has a great stake in the exposition,
greater, indeed, , than in the Columbian or Paris af
fairs. As for Paris, it is doubtful if we received any
practical benefit there, because under the rules of Â».!is
game our exhibits were merged in that of the^wholc
Union and their individuality was submerged. What;
California needs in such a competition , is the rigid
preservation of her individuality, which is matchless.
It is l^nown to botany, 1 dendrology, geology, agricul-;.
ture and horticulture that this State has and produces
the greatest variety in each division, known in the
world. No one other single geographical division of
the planet is our equal. We have the greatest variety
of precious and useful metals and minerals, of timber,
of vegetable agents in therapeutics, of thermal an.i
medicinal waters,' of root crops, cereals and fruits; to
be found^ grouped together anywhere on earth. It is
hardly appreciated, by our own vineyardists 'that we
Â¦grow here grouped together a "greater' variety of
grapes than will' produce in company, in any other
vine-growing region of the world. In our soil awd\
climate the vines, of. France, . Germany, Spain and
Italyj of Syria. and Persia and -Greece, all find; a
friendly environment and express their satisfaction in
abundant crops. The grapes of. Nassau and Eshcol*
vie with each other in fruitfulness, and the descend
ants of the. vines of Shiloh here blush still for the ab
duction of the girls who danced among the vines by
the sons of Benjamin. I
California then needs, that she may have justice, that
her resources be grouped and viewed together. This
is to be done at Buffalo by the State Board of Trade,
and it should gratify our people that this is to. be
done and well done without asking a bawbee from the
State treasury. . â¢ .
The producers of the State should see to it that
nothing is omitted, from a potato to a Persian date,
from kaolin to, gold, from a lowly manzanita to a
loidly sequoia. All that goes should be of the bc>t.
Californians traveling in the East observe that ours
has become a name to conjure with. In every town,
large and small, and in every village, no matter how
remote, are seen signs, "California Products." "Cali
fornia Fruit Emporium," and even "California
Saloon," and it is gratifying that they try to live up
to the name.
The commercial sophisticator has not been slow to
see his advantage, and .so we find products that come
slowly to imperfect maturity under colder sun* and
labeled with our magic "name in order that they may
find a sale.
But when the Eastern consumer has once tasted
our true products in their toothsome and palate ex
alting perfection he is not easily deceived by the
fraudulent substitute. When his eye has caressed the
contour and colors of our fresh fruits no jaundiced
and acid product of the moss-grown Eastern orchards
can lure or deceive him. _ , ; Â¦
We are to have a great revival of immigration. The
occasion at Buffalo should be improved by every
locality in the State that needs people, and that means
every locality, to put within public reach the economic
literature which is sought by men who want to change
their homes and seek their fortunes afar. The litera
ture should be practical. Tables of rainfall and tem
perature go much farther with the reasonable people
we want than rhapsodies about climate. Such table.*,
illustrated by pictures of California homes in* what
{ the Eastern people call "the winter months," will do
I more for immigration than hyperbole and all its re.
: lated figures of extravagant speech. The Eastern man
I who comes, sees, settles and is happy, will do all the
tropical metaphor business for us. When he U
soundly converted into a Californian, with the zeal of
a neophyte he will see beauties not revealed to our
accustomed vision, and will do all ,the needed ranis
horning required to topple the walls of Eastern in
difference. As for us, the noble rhetoric of under
statement is all that is required. Let the new settler
find the book better than the prospectus. Leave thj
rhapsody to him.
ON TO BUFFALO.
Mrs. Glyn.who at present la sojourning
In Egypt, Is one among- all- that authors
and authoresses who are most spoken
abcufjust now.: - Â¦ ' â¢
Her -new book. "The Visits of Eliza
beth," has sprung Into great notice and
Is selling In the most extraordinary fash-
Ion. It Is hardly possible to keep pace
with the amazing demand. The publish
ers are getting edition after edition print
ed. In society circles In particular It la
the book of the day. Not to have read It
or not to be reading "The Visits of Eliza
beth" is to-be quite behind the times.
In the absence of publications of any
special note, the week has seen some re
markable sales of old books. . *
The most curious was . the auction at
Futtick & Simpson's rooms of a number
of rare and quaint specimens of Ameri
cana, wnich brought rather big prices.
One of the most important was Raphe
Hamar's "True Discourse of the Present
State of Virginia," dated 1615. which was
knocked down for Â£50 <|2S0). . An even
brisker competition took place for the
work containing the discoveries of John
Lederer in three several marches from
Virginia to West Carolina. 1672. The ham
mer felt for Â£55 (1273). Another imoprtant
price, Â£15 ($75). was^glven for Richard
Hakluyt's "Principal Navigations, Vol
aees. Trafflques and Discoveries of the
English Nation Made at Sea." printed In
159S. Richard Witbourne's "Discourse on
the Discovery of Newfoundland," 1622,
went for six guineas. Mather's "Brief
History of the War With the Indians in
New England." 1676.. fetched Â£13 (Â»5). For
an MS. containing details respecting the
early American colonies, dated 1721, tbe
bidding stopped at Â£21 ($105). Tbe lot was
bought in* a much heavier price being the
reserve.
On tbe whole, it was considered & rather
remarkable sale.
In all circles great regret Is felt at the
death of Mrs. Godfrey Burr. She was
quite In the bloom of youth, and was a
bride only nine months ago. Mrs. Burr's
maiden name was Katherine Douglas
King, the - name under which she pub
lished several novels. One of these, by
the way. "The Scripture Reader of 9t.
Mark's, was returned in the MS. by an
eminent publisher on tbe plea, that he did
pot publish theology. The next publisher
read it, and so, a little later, did the pub
lic at large. Mrs. Burr herself was the
daughter of a publisher, the late H. S.
King, who added to Indian banking tbe
glories of issuing Tennyson's poems and
also those of Lady Harriet Baillle Ham
ilton, an admiral's daughter, whom Mr.
Klnc married. â¢
The Kate Barlass ("I, Kathertne. am a
Douglas Born") of whom Rossetti sings
in his ballad was an ancestress of Mrs.
Burr, who bore her names. She had
something also of the nature imputed to
that heroine and the spirit of ready self
sacrlflce. On the day of her wedding to
a hard-working Staffordshire vicar her
dedication gave poignancy In the eyes of
seme observers tor the festivities on the
borders of Epplng Forest. In fact, her
stories were written under the pressure
of money being needed for the East End
Hospital for Sick Children, to which she
hat: devoted the most eager. â¢ generous
hours of her unmarried life.
It is pretty well known that Haddon
Chambers had at one time an extenslvo
acquaintance with the prize ring, but It
will surely be news to most people that
for two or three years of his meteoric
career Bernard Shaw cultivated the
"fancy," so that his novel, "Cashel By
ron's Career." is like a historical novel,
fiction founded on fact.
1 The success of several American pirated
versions of the novel induced Mr. Shaw
to prepare a new edition, which Grant
Richards has now got in the press. â¢
Through the -Dally Mail Mr. Shaw says
his novel has been dramatized In America
entirely without his consent, and in order
to protect himself In England he had him
self turned the book into a play. As be
had to do it in a great hurry he has writ
: ten It In Shakespearian verse. This is
I Mr. Shaw's first appearance as a poet,
and he states that he himself is surprised
how extraordinarily easy Is writing verse.
The book will consist first or a long
preface, then the novel, then another pref
ace, followed by the play, and finally by
an essay on prize-fighting.
Altogether Mr. Shaw's new book prom
ises to be more than usually amusing. .
GOSSIP FROM
LONDON'S 'WORLD
OF LETTERS
â¢Thus Colonel Mosby's designation of. the South of
the future as- the "R*al .South" has ample justifica
tion in fact. It will never be the dominant section of
the Union, nor will Richmond ever surpass New York
in the East or San Francisco in the West, but all the
same it will be so much richer and better than the old
South that the colonel's fantastic predictions will have
some show of excuse.
The advancements of education is going- forward al
most as rapidly as the advance 'in 'industry. Tjie At
lanta Constitution .recently said: "The South is now
spending more money to educate its children than was
spent in the whole, country in i860." A marked im
provement has been also noted of late in* the political
sentiment of the people. It is true the Bourbons have
been able to carry out their plans for the suppression
of the negro vote to an extent that will compel the
attention of the Nationaf Government, but at the same
time there has been evident a growing tendency
among the better classes of Southern men to revolt
ag-unst Bourbon; domination. There are many in
fluential men in that section who now call themselves
"McKinley Democrats." These men are in favprof
protection, sound money, conservative government
and the general policies of Republicanism. Such nion
cannot long be compelled to serve Bryanism, and in
the end they will have to break openly with the party
of calamity and fiat. money..

Cramp & Bonnâ Proposal No. X, to build
a crulscr'of 970O tons displacement and a
speed of twenty-three knots In thirty-six

impossible to build a ship of the speed and
qualities required for less than 93,000,000.

Water Front Notes.
The French bark Grand Duchess Olga.
which left here for England with a cargo
of wheat April 30. 1900. Is giving the un
derwriters some uneasiness and 25 per
cent Is being paid to reinsure vessel and
cargo. Some time In July. 1900. the Grand
Duchess put into Papeete. Tahiti, ijitn
her foremast gone. A new mast had to
be sent out from France and she did not
resume her Journey until January 4. 1901.
She Is now out ninety-one days from Ta
hiti, hence the fear for her safety.
Grand Duchess Olga Overdue.
derinjr what accident will happen while
she is away from her station on thlsoc
casicn. Last year thÂ« German bark Olga
came alone and the captain listened in
vain for th^ lightship's warning whistle.
There was a dense fog at the time and
having nothing to guide him the captain
had to take chances. Twice he stood off
shore, as he thought, but the third time
the Olffa went ashore on the beach about
two miles south of the Cliff Ho us e. Lf ,5 er
she was towed off and repaired. All that
will mark the place where the HfhtsMP
ought to be for the next month will be a
gas buoy. .

the regular 25 cent size for IS cents,, and the trial size for S cents, sent by mail on receipt of price. â¢ Â¦ , '
P. S.â I regard Soap as a Medicine. It affects the whole human system. It either benefits or injures] The
i pores of the body take into the system more or less of the soap, and the blood carries the same to every organ of :
the body. Therefore it is important that people should use only soap that is free from poisonous fats and danger- j
ous alkalies. The time will come when scientists will discover that many diseases have been transmitted by the i
use of impure soaps. I want the public to have the same confidence in my soap that they have in my Rheumatism

NEW TORK. Asrll 4.â To-day , was one of
violent excitement and extreme nervous ten

an nnpreredentedly vloient and erratic manner
all day. The speculative spirit had apparently
run wild and no feate seemed too great to at

vt uuKtt were toued backward and forward
an4 millions of dollars were ventured with no
more concern than tboog-h pennies were being
pitched. News or actual conditions of proper

violent price movement and the unprecedented ,
volume of the dealings In the stocks â¢which
have held the foremost plare In the dealings
Indicate wiidness and reckless excess. The
speculative fever is evidently widely extended
and the telegraph plays an Important part In
the dealings, bringing orders to the Stock Ex
charge in Immense volume from all over the
country. ;
A notable feature of the market Is that the |
stocks most prominently affected have been the 1
high-grade dlvldend-paylnc railroad stocks.
There have been many old rumors revived re- '
gardlng these properties to carry along the ad
vane*, but of actual news regarding them |
there has beer, none of imDortance and the |
rumors have lÂ»eu met with emphatic official j
denials in-many instances. These denials have
been tc tally ignored by the speculators, who
have continued to buy the stocks on an enor
mous scale and to bid up the prices with reck
less crxfldÂ»nc* and then to cite the continued
rite in prices as confirmation of the rumors.
The lucreastng wi!dn*?s of the speculation has
been viewed with misgivings by many observ
ers, and many of the more conservative com
mtwlon houses have advised their customers
to *ell out and take their profits. But such
advice counts for little when the sell'.nr Is
repeatedly followed by renewed buoyancy and
further excited advances. The conviction hÂ«s
been wldeÂ«pread that much of the buying was
for investment by bankers arid capitalists and
by rettre^entitlvea of .others seeking extension
of Ictcremt and control, but â¢ tills supposition
cannot be verified In any. authoritative man
ner. ;â¢ . . â¢ ,
There has been enormous profit-taking at
every staxe of the advance, and this is ad
duced as evidence of the health of the market.
But it is to be borne in mind that the taking
of rror.ts involves a buyer at the hUh level
i as well as a teller. So adequate judrm^r.t can
b* formed of the health of the market until
the character of these buyers, who are tlw
preecnt holders, becomes better known. Thin
can -only be by a considerable reaction in
prices ThÂ» Quarterly disbursements cf Inter
est and dividends have afforded relief to the
money markets all over the world this week.
In New York the p-=rchasÂ« of short term Gov
ernment bond*, for the sinking fund by the
Secretary of the Treasury was an additional I
factor toward relief. London borrowed gold
In Â»w Ycrk as being the fhearÂ»st money
ceattr and shipped It to Paris In payment of
oblts-atlrne. Ixtoklnc to thÂ«> future. It !<t ex

They Escape and Two Sub- . '
' â¢ pects Arrested. '.--* â¢ .
. CHARDQN, Ohio, April 1â A. gang of a
half-dozen robbers early to-day blew open
the safe of the Citizens* ' Savings Bank
here and after a desperate fight with
Night Watchman Pomeroy and a citizen
succeeded in making their escape. It ta
believed the robbers secured less than $200.
Night Watchman Pomeroy discovered the
men at work in ths bank. He was seized,
bound and gagged, but not until he had
shot one of the burglars. Dr. Hadson.
who lives near the bank, was aroused by
the noise and came to the scene. He was
also seized and tied hand and foot. It re
quired three big charges of dynamite to
blow the safe door off. After completing
their' work the robbers left town on a
handcar.
> Early to-day two men were arrested at
Wllloughby upon the charge of being
members of the gang which robbed the
Chardon bank. The robbers succeeded in
gaining entrance to only one compartment
of the big safe. In another part, which
was not reached, it la said nearly $50,000
was stored.
Pomeroy is badly used up. After he stot
one of the burglars he was unmercifully
clubbed over the head. After being bound
and gagged the watchman was dragged
Into the bank. He lay there a witness to
all the operations.
At each explosion the robbers retired to
places of safety. Pomeroy lay In an ex
posed place and no attention was -paid to
him, except that one of the robbers, -whose

shot from Pomeroy's gun. occasionally

The robbers . were a long time getting
Into the vault. They gathered up the loose
coins -lying about and then went at the
strong box. They exploded several charges
but could not force It. â¢ - .,-..â¢
After an investigation to-day Cashier -C.
L>. Smith of tha bank said: "The. robbers
got $123 In gold. $20,000 in certificates held
against the bank by individuals and 125.000
or $30,000 worth of mortgage and otber se-.
curities belonging to Individuals. None
of the paper taken Is negotiable. There
was $30,000 in currency In another vault,
which they did not touch." -.-
A posse of citizens is scouring the sur
rounding country for the robbers. It Is
believed that some coins found in posses

OAKLAND, April 4.â George Neuistadt.
a sleek young thief, who has been the
subject of numerous police investigations
In Oakland and San Francisco, was taught
to-day that evildolng docs not always go
unpunished. Police Judge Smith convict
ed the dapper impostor of stealing a dia
mond rinir from Miss Ethel Reier and
sentenced him to a six months' term in
the City Prison, tho maximum penalty of
the law.
Realizing his. own guilt, Neuistadt be
gan to beg for mercy before he had been
convicted. The circumstances of the theft
were these: Xeuistadt had become ac
quainted with the young woman and had
been calling at her plno^ of employment
on Seventh street, near Washlnpton. One
morning about a month ago Miss Reier
had removed her rings from her fingers
and laid them on the counter. Neuistadt
picked up a diamond circlet and slipped
oui of the store. Pursuit was given,- but
the fleet-footed thief had disappeared.
Neuistadt was arrested a few days ago
in San Francisco, but the sera was not
recovered.
Neuistadt first came under police notice
when Chief Hodgkins. then a detective,
arrested him in December. 1898, for felony
embezzlement, the charge being for tho
theft of a valuable sword from Colonel
Wagner of San Francisco. Xetiistadt then
wore the uniform of a marine In the
United States navy. The charge of em
bexrlemeni was not prosecuted, n? th-*
sword was recovered and returned to its
owner.
Neuistadt was next heard from in the
pulse of an officer of marines and a hero
of Manila Bay. The San Francisco police
received records from Mare Island show
ins that Xeulstadt had been twice con
victed of absence without leave and had
a bad record.
Xeuistadt next bobbed up under arrest
for intimidating: women, representing him
self as a detective. Taken before the Lun
acy Commissioners for examination, he
Â¦was discharged because they believed he
was a rascal^ The .charge of blackmailing
has also been made agninst him.
Neuistadt is about 21 years of age. he
says, but during 1 his three and a half
years' residence, on this coast he has been
most variously employed. After he was
eliminated from the navy he became a
finger in a church choir and he claims
to have been employed by the Paclnc Mu
tual Life Insurance Company and the
Continental Building and Loan Society of
San Francisco as a solicitor.
Before Judge Smith had an opportunity
td decide- the case after the evidence was
in. Neuistadt turned to his Honor. cay-
Ing: "Judgre. give me another chance,
piease. I have a ticket waiting: for me
at the German Consul's to sro home."
"You haven't been convicted yet," in
terrupted the surprised magistrate. Then
the prisoner stopped, realizing- that ho
had practically confessed his crullt. After
he had been convicted Neuistadt was ad
vised by his attorney to accept sentence.
Five minutes later he was "dolny time"
in a steel tank of the prison.

STOCKTON, April 4.â A sensational
contention Is made by the attorneys for
Mary. Mann, one of the claimants of the
immense Kasson estate, a contest of
which developed many sensational fea
tures when the will was contested some
two years ag-o.
It has been discovered that Judge E. I.
Jones, now Judge of the Superior Court
of this county, acted as attorney for
Clark McChesncy, executor of the Kasson
will, In 1895. while he was a practicing
attorney. The accounts of. the executor,
show that he paid Attorney Jones 97 for
ndvlce In relation to the estate. This, the
attorneys for Mary .Mann claim, dis
qualifies him from sitting: In: the case,
which will come up before him next Sat
urday on the motion of. Mary Mann' for a
new trial.
It 'Is claimed aleo that this state of af
fairs nullifies the action of. the Judge In
several lawsuits which he declde4 In favor
of the estate. , â¢ v
One of the Claimants Contends That
Superior Judge Is Not Qualified
to Preside.

Teachers' Mayday Festival.
SACRAMENTO. April 4.â There was a
heavy frost in this locality last night, but
fruit growers and gardeners say that thf lr
crops were not Injured. The recent rams
were of great benefit to the crops. The
weather here Is warm and sunny.
SANTA ROSA. ApVll 4.â The severe
frosts of the past few mornings have
done some damage to the fruit and grape
crop in this vicinity. Reports from al
most all sections of the county received
here to-day tell of losses. The lowlands
appear to have suffered most. ! Cherries,
peaches and prunes are the fruits most
damaged. .,-.Â¦.
Â¦ FRESNO, April 4.â Frost has done very
little damage in this part of the county
and crop prospects* of every kind were
never better at this season of the year.
The told, north winds, however, have had
the effect of drying up some of the grain
and rain is desired. ' The rain on Tuesday
amounted only to .07. ; '
SALINAS, April 4.â During the last few
days this locality was visited by a..boun
tiful rain, the precipitation amounting to
one-quarter of an Inch. Good crops are
assured. - , â¢ .
SAN JOSE, April " 4.â Fruit crops in
Santa Clara County, though affected
somewhat by the recent - frosts, will be
above the average. /Apricots, peaches
and prunes are all showing up well. Hay
and grain prospects were never so good
In the history of the valley.
STOCKTON, April 4.â The outlook, for
grain crops in this county the coming sea
son Is excellent. The acreage is -about the
sumo as last year. In some of the over
flowed tracts it Is expected that late bar
ley crops will be produced. .Fruit, espe
cially â¢cherries, has been damaged some
what by recent frosts, and there is some
damage to grapevines. Almonds and apri
cots, however, have suffered, but little
and immense crops are looked for. .
WOODLAND. April 4.â Heavy frost this
morning was general througnout Â¦â¢ Yolo
County, and the damage was considerable.
Grapevines will produce only a second
crop. The prunes are completely de
stroyed. Almonds and apricots escaped
with less damage .on account of the pro
tection of heavy foliage. Peaches were
damaged materially. â¢ - â¢.
SAN DIEGO, April 4.â With normal
weather for the next four weeks the. grain
crops in this' county will be the largest
for many years past. More than average
returns are assured from the early sown
grain, but as yet it Is premature to esti
mate either the grain or hay crop. The
shower of last Saturday was of consider
able assistance to the fields, and with
even an inch of rain this month the crop
will be unusually heavy.
LOS ANGELES. April 4.â The weather
during the past few days has for the
most part been clear and cold. Yester
day .06 of an inch of rain fell, hardly suf
ficient to be of much benefit, and a liberal
Â«hower is much needed. Saturday night
the temperature In Los Angeles and vi
cinity erached a minimum of ' 41 degrees
and last night touched 44 degrees. Frost
has been reported In some of the moun
tain districts, and in San Fernaridino Val
ley damage has resulted to apricots' and
walnuts. The apricot crop will be short.
Other fruits promise a large yield, but
the warm weather of- March has caused
early blossoming and any serious cold
snap would do great harm. Late sown
grain will fail unless rain comes soon.

Passover Services. ,
Paschal services commenced In the synÂ«
ogogues on Wednesday evening and yes
terday morning the solemn ritual of the
feast was read in all the places of wor
ship. Pasach, or the passover, is an im
portant feast in the - Hebrew calendar.
For eight days the members of the Jew
ish faith eat unleavened bread, which is
In the form of round crackers, known as
matzos. The orthodox Jew strictly ob
serves Paaach. During the eight days he
refrains from eating food that is "hoo
mits," such as candy, cakes and other
delicacies that are not home made. Mem
bers of the denomination are not com
pelled to fast during this season. On the
contrary, they feast off the good things
of the land. On Wednesday night families
met at the festal board and while the
father* read passages from his book of
prayer the sacred meal was eaten. Last
night In many households a second feast
was eaten with all the ceremonies that
are observed by the orthodox Jew at this
season of the year. -,'.Â¦; : .

Justice Garoutte refused to express his
opinion of the plaintiff and was soon dis
niisted from the stand. * .
â¢ Several witnesses tollowed Justice Gar
routte in raptd succession. Ex-Judge Nus
bnurser of Oakland was again on the
>tun<! and explained the reasons which
prompted Judge Paterson . to say that
Philbrook was crazy. Judge Nusbaumer
said he consulted Judge Paterson as to
what disposition he. should make of Phil
fcrcck. who he sajd had destroyed his
temjier beyond repair.
"I said that 1 was inclined to club Phil
brook to death." said Judge Nusbaumer.
"but Judge Paterson advised me not to
take such harsh action because he said
Philbrook was crazy, irresponsible, nutty
or something of that kind." In conclu
siaon Judge Nusbaumer said Judge Pater
son acted impartially and even . friendly
toward Philbrook.
If Justices of the Supreme Court Harri
son, McFarland and Garoutte bear any ill
will toward Horace W. Phllbrook they
refrained from expressing the same When

on behalf of the plaintiff in the action In

would furnish some Information which

PHILBROOK GETS
BUT FEW FACTS
The case of Clara McCann, charged with
attempting to extort money, was dismiss
ed by Judge Cabanlss yesterday on mo
tion of the attorney for the defendant on
the ground that the complaint issued last
November is defective. At the same time
It was intimated that the complaining
witness In that case would cot prosecute.
The charge of vagrancy against Miss
Me Cann- was again called in Judge Mo
gan's court yesterday. She was arrested
on complaint of Jacob J. Gottlob of the
Columbia Theater, but as he has left the
city on his honeymoon trip and will be
absent for some months there was a dis
position at first on the part of the pros
ecution to drop the case. Her attorney
insisted yesterday upon it being set for
trl&l'by a jury. He said he would be sat
isfied with flvo jurors. The Judge con
tinued the case till next Thursday for
trial and lssuVd a venire for lifty trial
jurors.
Yesterday morning a brother of
Mrs. Gottlob called upon Chief Sul
livan and showed him a. letter
which his mother, Mrs. Dannen
bauin, 2319 California street, had received
from Miss McCann. Jn this letter Miss
McCann -reviled Gottlob and said that al
though hn was married she woujd follow
him to the end of the earth. She al3o
threatened to kill him. She claimed he
l.ad ruiined her life and she had no money
to support herself or hermother. â¢
The Chief sent Dannenbaum with Pollce
nif.n Sylvester to the warrant and bond
clerk's office to get a warrant charging
th*i McCann woman with extortion, but
after reading the letter^Clerk Fltzpatrlck
saii there was. nothing in it that would
justify such a charge.

About harf an hour before the. shooting
occurred Wtlllam Fitzgerald, while walk-
Ing along Fremont fJrert. between'Mar
ket and MIsKton. was confronted by two
men. one of whom h&d a revolver. Fitz
gerald was ordered to throw up his hands,
but instead of dolnÂ»r so turned and ran.
He succeeded In escaping, though three
shots were tired at him. none of the/bul-
Icts. however, taking effect. Fltzg^ra'd
reached the Chicago Hotel. :Â».*!- Stfuart
street* whern he resides, and told of the
attempted hold-up.
Several other hold-ups wore reported to
the police last night, but they declined to
give Â«>m details.
The police were at once notified, but up
to an early hour this morning they had
not succeeded in obtaining a clew to the
murderous footpads.
Sinyard described the man who shot
him as being about five feet seven inches
in height and weighed about 150 pounds.
He was clean shaven nnd had light hair.
The other, he says, was about two Inches
taller and was much heavier.
Deputjr District Attorney Fltzpatrlck
was at once sent for and he took the dy
ing man's statement. In a feeble voice
Sinyard said that before he started for
his lodgings hs visited a saloon at Second
and Natoma street?. He had several drinks
there and then walked down Howard
street. On reaching Spear street two men.
both of whom wore slouch hats, sprang
out of a doorway anil at the point of a
pistol ordered him tp throw up nls hands.
"I told th<*n to go to a warmer cli
mate." remarked the wounded sailor, "as
I thought they were shipmates and were
trying to have some fun with me. As I
started down the street one of the men
shot me in the side, after shouting to me
to stop. I fell to the sidewalk, and as I
lay prostrate, or.o of the men searched
my pockets, while the other stood over
me threatening to kill me if I made an
outcry. After taking all the money I had
tho man who shot me passed his gun to
his companion and ran up Howard street.
Tho other leisurely walked along Spear
street and finally disappeared.
Â¦"It's all off with me," pitifully remarked
the victim of the footpads. "For God's
sake take me: to the hispital."
.With the assistance .of several friends
Anderson conveyed the wounded man to
the Harbor Receiving Hospital, where an
examination disclosed that he was beyond
all human aid.
Although weak from tho loss of blood,
Sinyard. realizing that to remain where
he had- falien meant sure death, managed
to regain his feet after frequent attempts
and to walk down Howard street, hoping
to meet a policeman. â¢. "
After, walking within one door of his
lodging-house he . met a friend named
Alex Anderson, also a sailor, and falling
into' his arms he begged Ulm to send for
a doctor. â¢ - â¢
Albert Sinyard. a oailor, was shot "and
mortally wounded by two* footpads at the,
corner of Howard and Spear, streets late'
last night. Sinyard was on his way to his
room at 213 Steuart street, when 'he was
suddenly confronted by the two men, one
of whonl commanded Him to throw up his
hands. Thinking he was the victim of
practical' Jokers Sinyara replied with an
eplthet*and was about to continue on his
way, when one of the .footpads pointed
his revolver at him and flred. The bul
let entered Sinyard's left side, passing
In dangerous proximity to his neart and
causing a fatal wound. . Â¦
As the unfortunate man fell to the si'ic
v.alk tho desperate robbers went through
his pockets, securing about $1 50.
After taking his moneythey fled In op~

â¢ -The Chinese section of San Francisco is
about to receive what It has long needed
thorough fumigation, Renovation and dis
infection. The sanitary brigade will begin
operations to-day under the immediate di
rection of the State Board of Health. Yes
terday. Dr. W. P. Lawlor. representing
the State authorities, reported to "Dr.
"White of the Federal service that work
would be commenced at once.
.The San Francisco Board of Health. Dr.
Williamson chairman, will co-operate
Â¦with the Federal and State authorities in
the execution of the plans sdopted at the
recent Palace Hotel conference, in which
Governor Gage and Mayor Phelan partici
pated: An agreement proposed at the con
ference m-as subsequently revised and ac
cepted by the health representatives of
the city and State.- It is stipulated in the
agreement that the State shall expend at'
least fS.OOO in fumigating, disinfecting *ud
cleaning up Chinatown-
Plans in detail were not submitted, as
the State Beard of Health reserved the
right to perform the proposed work in its
own way. The nature of the renovation,
the manner of fumigation, the system of
disinfection, the number of men to be em
ployed, and the quantity and quality of
materials to be used were not stipulated
in the agreement. The general direction
of the woik Is committed to Dr. White of
the United States Marine Hospital corps.
Â«nd conditions prescribed by him will
doubtless be respected. â¢
The State Board" of Health may enter
irto enpaptment later on to expend even
more than 55.000. At the outset it was
deemed best to pledge a liberal sum In
order to enccuTage active co-operation on
the pert of the city and to convince the
public that soirething' more than a sur
face clean-up, wiih a sprinkling of chlo
ride of lime, was contemplated.
It is stipulated that the local Board of
Health shall nrovide a morgue, labora
tory, parbage crematory and detention
hospital in the Chinese quarter. The
morjrue and crematory will be established
on the north Mde of- Pacific, between
Stockton and Dupont streets. Premises
occupied as a dispensary, on Sacramento
rtreet. near Waverly plare. may be se
cured for the proposed detention hospital.
The amount of city funds available at
rresent is S&>JO. Th> local authorities are
Mot expÂ«-cted to provide extensive build
tnss for morgue, hospital, crematory and
laboratory, hence it is estimated that the

BIG CLEAN UP
IN CHINATOWN
BEGINS TO-DAY
THE SAN FRAj^SCO^C^
A meeting of the union and the striking
shipfUters. and apprentices who aro not
members of that union, was held last
night in the opera-house. Bedford Day.
district chulrman of the union, presided.
With Avry little discussion it was unani
mously decided to accept the agreement
and return to work this morning.
The ntrlkers had asked that the "handy
men" be put bark at the work of common
laborers* and that no men be employed at
tilting except Journeymen fitters and ap
prentices. Tho concession mado is much
less, but the strikers. and the riveters, who
wnlkcd out In sympathy with them, feel
that a partial victory at least has been
won, and they are glad that the strike
has ended before assuming serious pro
portions.
The action of the riveters, of which no
tice had been given on Tuesday, caused
the first overture to be made by James
Dickie, who has been acting as superin
tendent since the accident with which
John T. Scott met at the night launching
of the Spokane. While the riveters were
holding a meeting in the opera-house Mr.
Dickie sent word that he desired to see
the strikers' committee.- The members
went at once to his 'office, and he stated
the concessions which he was authorized
to offer. It was that an . agreement be
signed and delivered to the Boilermakers'
and Iron Shipbuilders' Union by which the
Union Iron works would be bound to ad
vance no more "handy men" to the 'work
of shipfltters for a period of one year, they
being allowed to retain their positions,
with the understanding that they receive
no promotion within the year.
This offer was taken before the public
meeting and discussed at some length.
Then the Boilermakers' find Iron Ship?
builders' Union held a meeting nnd agreed
Jo accept the compromise. There was
Homo more parleying, the committee be
ing sent back to Mr. Dickie to try to get
the period of the agreement extended to
two years, or eighteen months if two
years' could not bo secured. Mr. Dickie
could not grant the additional concension.
The riveters, chlppers and calkers, to
tho number of ?00. walked out at noon yes
terday, and for a time there was prospects
of a contest which would tie up the ship
yards Indefinitely. There were meetings
of the mechanics In the Potrero Opera
house and conferences of the strikers'
committee with the company officials, and
more meetings, until a final agreement
was reached.
The strike at the Union Iron Works has
beffn ei:ded by a compromise and the men
will return to work this morning. Conces
sions were made by the employers which
were satisfactory to- the shlpfltters.
though not embodying by any means all
that they had demanded.
