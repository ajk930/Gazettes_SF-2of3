failed to accomplish the Job they were
hired to perform. The speeches were de
livered despite the interruptions. The in
incident shows that the bosses will de
scend to disorder and ruffianism in . ef- .
forts to save poor Wells from utter de
feat.
John Lackmann's administration of the
affairs of the Sheriff's office is honest and
efficient. He asks election for another'
term. Voters, Irrespective of party, can
not do better than give to Mr. Lackmann
the support he desires and deserves. In
dications at the present time point to his
election by a large majority. At every
meeting of the candidates he is cheered
by the citizens.
Frank H. Gould will be the principal
speaker at the big Democratic meeting
to be held at Metropolitan .Temple to
morrow night. T. C. Van. Ness will pre
side and William J. McGee and Joseph S.
Tobin will attend. Mr. Gould, who is an
eloquent and able speaker', will pay his
respects to Samuel- M. Shortrldge.
Rioters and Looters , Combine.
All the candidates were actively at work
yesterday. It is a known fact that the al
lied bosses have abandoned . all hope of
saving the Herrin-Burns Supervisorial
ticket. The nominees are advised to shift
for themselves. It is too \u25a0 late to \u25a0 pull
Wells out of the fight, but at the last
hour, orders may go forth for the push
to swing in for Schmitz.
-Every property owner, merchant" and
&Â»i^HE danger of Schmitz's election
II can be removed by a general
I rally of all the conservative and
Â«Â» law-respecting citizens to the
support of Joseph S. Tobin. The
Wcent swing of events in San Francisco
Ictight to convince the intelligent voter
that the race is now between Tobin and
Echinltz- Wells Is practically out of the
running. The forecast of politicians is
that he will not get one-half the Republi
can vote.
The tip was given out last night that
the railroad bosses, in a epirit of pique
e.nd revenge, nad resolved to throw down
Wells at the last minute and transfer
their forces to Echmitz. The tactics em
ployed in the Eutro election are to be
brought Into play agairL Perceiving the
defeat of Wells, the desperate leaders
are ready to sacrifice the industrial and
moral welfare of San Francisco to get
even. Tobin comes out openly and pledges
hto:>elf to protect the city from the greed
end rapacity of the corporations and al
lied bosses. He. stands for clean local
government, and the bosses have no use
for a Mayor whose administration they
cannot control.
Hoodlums Insult Grerman Voters.
A Jarge audience of German-speaking
citizens assembled at Metropolitan Tem-
A pie last night to listen to a discussion of
issues by eminent speakers.
Hoodlums hired by the bosses to insult
the Germans and cry down the speakers

IN response to a call issued by a num
ber of prominent German-Americans
i of San Francisco for a mass.-meeting
in the" interests of Joseph S. Tobin
for Mayor â¢ an immense audience
gathered at ;*Metropolitan Temple last
night. It was a cosmopolitan gathering
and included : representatives of all the
parties. The principal addresses were in
German and the orators appealed to their
brethren from ! the fatherland to forget
partisanship and advance the interests of
the municipality by discarding all political
prejudices and casting their v.otes for
Tobin for Mayor on Tuesday next. '
The harmony of the meeting was dis
turbed at times by the disgraceful" buf
foonery of a gang of Schmitz's and Wells'
sympathizers in the gallery, who greeted
every reference to Tobin with hisses and
hooting. .Every allusion to honest govern-,
ment and the awakening of conscience in
peace-loving men provoked derisive laugh
ter. It was only when ex-Governor Budd
took the speaker's stand and humorously
invited j interruptions on the theory \u25a0' that
being well seasoned hie could stand almost
anything, that the hoodlums Abated their
Mbffortsjto stampede the meeting -by their
disgraceful manifestations of disapproval.
When! Charles A.. Zinkand attempted, to
speak after Tobin had quitted the rostrum
the belligerency of the gallery contingent
again manifested Itself in j repeated shouts
for Budd. - M r. . Zinkand was forced to;re
tira and' Budd j again took the j floor. The
outrageous conduct of the j Schmitz and
Wells hoodlums filled the respectable ele-
olutlon the Germans ,1 in America were

try, of their adoption; ! Resuming he said ;
What is the situation to-day? Let us consider
it carefully. Upon the result of ' this election
depends the' future welfare of- this city. â¢ Never

there been an administration so free from the

Francisco. Eugene E. Schmits, the agitators' candidate, proclaims,
in effect, that if he* is elected Mayor police protection shall not - be
afforded to mercantile interests. His tavouage was significant. His
hearers understood it. Only one fair construction can be placed on
his declaration relative to the use of policemen to guard trucks. He
means that tlie force authorised by law shall not be invoked to pro

Mr. Schmitz lies the knowledge of hla
unfaithfulness to the cause which he now
champions. Ever since . the Sd day of,
June, when the positions of union molders
were filled by non-union men, Mr. Schmitz
has continued his business and used the
product of non-union shops, thereby
showing himself a foe to organized labor.

union castings and contributing his share

The San Francisco Call.AFTER.
Bulletin Editorial. October 29, 1901:
There is no longer any doubt that the busi
ness men, the â¢ property-oivners, the men who
have material interests in San Francisco, are
going to ijpte for Asa R. Wells for Mayor. They
are going to do -it because they fear the- effect
zvhich the election of .an untried man will have
upon the progress and prosperity of the city.
Tobin cannot hold his party vote. He is dis
liked by the poor men/ for his. airs and anglo
mania, and he is only tolerated by the better class
of the people upon whom he ought to be able to
rely for his most substantial support. . ; ' \u25a0 .; : :';- \u25a0 '
: : -; : Then, too, Mr. Tobin is too young. 'A man;
to be property qualified for Mayor, requires
among other things equanimity. Money and youth
are not the only requisites. They are the chief
possessions of this young man, but they are not
the things thai: catch the votes of â¢ prudent men.
No, a man to be Mayor should be a' man and not
a child: He should never lose his' equilibrium.
The situation then is reduced to this:
Tobin, young, leader of a split party, hot
headed, vain, disliked by the poor and far in the
rear. . ' ': ; :\u25a0. " ' ' ;\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 - , . '; '
Wells, a, tried man, honest, capable, safe
â¢for the business interests of the city, trusted by
all, and opposed by the Chronicle and Call. Wells
ought to be elected. \
The Call and Chronicle accuse Wells of the
dreadful crime of being an old .man. Those sel
fish and disgruntled papers describe Wells, zvho
is strong, active and alert in mind and body, as if
he had to be carried on a stretcher from district
to district. They have raised the old cry of cor
rupt influences, and have rigged up the old buga
boos. .'\u25a0;.'
rHE BULLETIN is twinkling like the evening stars for Wells and his ipecac Supervisor
ticket. It flourishes its faded cotton umbrella as a truncheon while it shouts the or
ders of a file-closer to Republicans to vote fcr Wells, thereby running the risk of r electing
Schmitz and ruining the city. ._ V J. ' '

. It was during Mr. Rosenthal's address
that the first outburst of the hoodlum ele
ment in the gallery came. His allusion to
Tcbln provoked a storm of hisses and
booting, which did not subside for several
minutes. During this disgraceful proceed
ing tbo audience on the main floor, com
posed . for the greater part of the best
German residents of the city, evidenced
thÂ«dr disgust by cries- for order. The dis
reputable gang in the gallery yelled for
Budd, who was seated upon the stage,
but: Chairman Rosenthal Introduced F. E.
Hesthal and that gentleman was allowed
to proceed with comparatively little In
terruption.
Appeal for Good Government.
Mr. Hesthal, who spoke in German, said
he had resided ln^lhis city for. twenty
yean, but this was his first appearance
on the rostrum, yet the conditions" were
eucli, be resumed, that he was constrained
to lift his voice In behalf of a good and
con:iervatlve government. The statement
that: there are no issues in this campaign

' MtJiy voter* are of the opinion that it is their
duty to -vote -for the candidate* of their party.
This Is a false impression. Every voter should

The speaker then referred to Mr. Tobin
as follows:
*,S^ h % Â» d now an administration, my
friends and I speak to the Germans especially

most conservative of citizens, the best think
ers and the best home-makers, and usually as

thered your interests, a man f who has aided in
reducing street car, fares from 5 \u25a0 cents to 2V,

matter with Sammy Braunhart?") Yes, Sam
Is the man who drew, the bill, but Tobln backed
it. He is one of the men who have helped lay
up a surplus of $Â£3,000,' which 1b going to bs
expended in the first twelve months among the
laboring men of San Francisco on the streets
and the parks and in the building of school

who have paid off $320,000 .to school teachers

tell you what he has done. : ' -.
One thing they tried to criticise him about,
but when his record was . looked up he was
found to be correct. .It-was In regard to rais
ing the pay of laborers from 92 to $2 50 a day.

- Budd had Just begun hiÂ» tribute to To

as an official and â¢ was urging- his election
when .Tobin himself appeared'in' the hall.
. His : entrance was the signal ; for a tre-
viction regardless of party affiliations. It
should be a matter of principle and not politics.
Time brings about many changes. In local
politics changes are rapid between elections.
Mr. Wells has practically made the statement
that the election of Roosevelt depends upon
the success of the Republican party in this
city. What has the election of Roosevelt three
yeans hence to do with our local election? The
argument is quite untimely and ridiculously
lame. On another occasion Mr. Wells said
In connection with the acquisition of the Geary
street railroad franchise that In this as In
many other matters you ought to take tht
Mayor on trust. This is a bad rule to follow.
Mr. Wells has denied subserviency to corpora
tion rule and to political bosses. But it is un
deniable that the corporations have much to
say in the matter of Wells' election. This
Geary-street railroad question is an important
one, and Wells says Its acquisition must ' be
accomplished in "accordance with the provisions
of the charter, which is essentially a Demo
cratic Instrument.
In the matter of public utilities there can be
no question that their acquisition by the city
will give us cheaper water, gas and railway
fares. When the question of their acquisition
Is referred to the voters, there can- be no
doubt that it will carry. The succeedins years
are not onfy full of promise, but they may
prove critical ones In the history of this mu
nicipality. We need brave as well as young
and honest men at the head of our affairs. We
want a man like. Tobln to carry out the pro
visions of the charter. "Who is better Quali
fied to do this fearlessly and honestly than
Joseph S. Tobln? As the adviser of the di
rectors of one of the strongest financial Insti
tutions in America he has displayed qualities
\u25a0which entitle htm to the admiring- recognition
of all claeees. It is the iluty of every conscien
tious and honest citizen tq vote the Democratic
ticket straight, and to that ticket I 6ay "eln

Sudd's Tribute to Tobin.
Ex-Governor Budd was the next speak:
er. He spoke in a pleasant vein in order
to placate the hoodlum gang in the gal*
lery. and incidentally reproved the delin
quents for their shameful course in' In
terrupting the previous speakers.' He
provoked laughter by saying that he. had
been before the public so long that he
had become an expert in dodging every
thing, even bouquets and bad fruit. "
Mr. Budd then epoke of the duty of the
public in the matter of recognizing merit
in their officials. It was an undeniable
truth that this city was never better
served than by the present administration
during the last two years. For years the
people of San Francisco demanded an
amendment of the constitution by \u25a0 "which
they might be allowed to direct their own
affairs under a special charter \ which
should be above interference by State of
ficials/" That"chaTter " was "'given ' to 'â¢ the

ty-fifth Assembly District last evening.
The meeting was held in the hall at the

men assembled for the purpose of pledg
ing to support a candidate. More than 230
members signed the roll. The officers

dent, L. J. Dolan; secretary, J. J. Sullivan;
treasurer, Thomas McGraith.
tax-paying voter and every other citizen
who is concerned in the prosperity of the
city should get in line for Tobin. National
and State issues cut no figure In the cam
paign. With all deference to Shortridge-
Wells oratory it can be said that the
valor of colored* troops at San Juan Hill
is not a local issue. The issue is San
Francisco. Shall the city be turned over
to the looters and rioters?
Speaks on Issues of Campaign in Four
Different Assembly
Districts.
Joseph S. Tobin \ stock is on the rise.
Apart from his appearance at the German
mass-meeting in Metropolitan Hall the
candidate' for Mayor last night addressed
four meetings in four different Assembly
districts. In his four audiences were such
wide differences of nationality and social
condition as can only be found in a
metropolis like San Francisco. Every
hall in which he appeared was crowded,
every audience greeted him with enthus
iasm and cheered his business-like, honest
"man-talks" to the echo.
Tobln is gaining in popularity and is
receiving the confidence of all interested
in the welfare of the city. His- last ap
pearance .last evening was at Pythian
Castle, where he dropped in by invitation
to address a gathering of journeymen
butchers celebrating a high jinks.
Schmitz also addressed the meeting and
as Tobin climbed the stairs with rapid
stride he bumped right into the 'Labor
Union candidate. Tobln looked up. j
"Schmitz!" he said.
"Tobln!" said Schmitz.
Tobin then stretched out his hand, ex
pressed his pleasure at meeting the mu
sician 'and proceeded upstairs, where an
enthusiastic audience was awaiting him.
The first meeting was at Steimke'Hall,
Octavia and Union streets, where a.large
gathering of citizens of the Forty-first
District awaited him, Tobin spoke as fol
lows: .
A DANGEROUS ISSUE.
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: This
country is dedicated to the principle that all
men ere born free and equal. I do not be
lieve that ever before In the history of San
Francisco has the ' principle been antagonized
by a Dolltica! party until the present, time.
Never before have the people of San Francisco
been asked to support a ticket selected by one
class, from one class, and to the exclusion of
all other classes. This is a dansrerous issue.
Be very careful. There is no room In this
country for classes. Under the flag we all
honor there is but one class, and that Is the
people. Let every property-holder remember
1878 and reflect. .
This is a business proposition. There is
neither Democracy, Republicanism nor trades
unionism in keeplns the streets clean, In light
ing them properly and at a reasonable cost
and in keeping taxes down to. the lowest pos
sible fleure.
He then referred to Wells' demand that
at least one honest man be placed upon
the Republican Supervisorial ticket, and
told how the Republican candidate had
declared" his intention of having ,his way
or withdrawing his name. Continuing, he
said:
He changed his mind.- "Why? Has he yet
explained why? Does it not show that there
was somebody behind him? . Did they not tell
him, "We have fixed the ticket; If you don't
like It. cet oft?" You can read In the Bulle
tin, the paper which Is supporting Mr. "Wells,
that it was to Mr. Herri n that he â¢ looked as
the - chief . authority for the names on that
ticket. - Does not this prove that that ticket
was dominated by the same corporations and
bosses . that in the past have . debauched the
city of San. Francisco?
â¢ CHOICE OF THREE TICKETS.
You have your choice between three tickets.
One representing one class of society; one
representing bosslsm and corporation corrup
tlonX. and the other the men who have been in
office for the last two years. I - do not intend
to Â«ay anything of our record further than to
remind you that we have reduced your taxes,
lowered your gas,. water and electric light ex
pense, Riven you a 2 1 / s-cent carfare for school
children, beautified your parks and made pro
vision for future Improvements. All we ask is
a fair hearing. All we ask you to do is to cast
your votes by the lisrht of what you know.
.Washington Square Hall on Union and
Stockton streets .was crowded to the
doors. The, cheers that have , 'greeted"
Tobin's every appearance were there to en
courage him* and every word he said was
listened to with attention.. He was intro
duced by. Dr. Glannini and spoke In part
as follows:" , *,
\u25a0 The ; chairman has told you that -I: am 'here
this evening on a business proposition. I have
in my hand.' the basis of that proposition. - It
is the budget of San Francisco for. the coming
fiscal year as fixed by the present administra
tion.* Upon > that bill fixing these expenditures
TOBIN GEOWS IN FAVOR
AND LOOKS A STJBE WINNER
mendous burst of. applause, to which he
responded with a modest bow. When
Budd finished his speech Tobin was intro
duced by the chairman as a progressive
young man. whose election would be of
vast benefit to the community. He thought
a man who bore the name of Sadoc, which
in an Oriental language signified "The
Just," would prove an honor to San Fran
cisco. Tobin then advanced and when the
cheering subsided he made the following
spirited and thoughtful address:
Tobin Replies to Charges.
Mr. Chairman, Ladles and Gentlemen: ' In
the course of this campaign I have been ac
cused first of the atrocious crime of being
young; secondly, of the equally enormous crime
of playing polo; thirdly, of the equally objec
tionable, aye,* treasonable act of having my
clothes made In England; fourthly and lastly,
gentlemen; of being somewhat clean In my
appearance. (Applause.)
All four of these are true. I hope, but -one.
"Which one it is, ladies and gentlemen, , you
can pick out. for yourselves. These things are
too puerile to talk about.
But while I am talking on this subject, ladles
and gentlemen, as Germans I know that you
are all deeply Interested in the athletic train-
Ing of youth. I know that the athletic train-
Ing of youth Is part of the system of educa
tion which Germany has founded and which is
to-day the brightest in the galaxy of Joys that
surrounds her head. Ladies and gentlemen,
would you prefer that- 1 v play polo or that I
pass my afternoons In the bay window of a
club telling ribald stories and drinking whisky?
(Applause.) Gentlemen, If in my career before
the public these are the only arguments against
me that my enemies can pick out then Indeed
I must be bullet-proof. (Applause.)
If I were to be asked, ladles and gentlemen,
what constitutes the primary elemental prin
ciples of the German character I should
say- domesticity and conservatism. The do
mesticity of the German I race is the
golden horn of plenty from which many good
things flow. Industry and perseverance, the
founding and building- of homes, the mainte
nance of the household virtues, the organiza
tion of an educational system which begins
with childhood- and culminates In the aspira
tions of the University of Germanyâ all these
things are traceable to the conservative, do
mestic oharacter of the Germans. In our own
country at the present time there Is no â¢\u25a0 influ
ence "so powerful in shaping the ends of uni
versal life as the influence of German philos
ophy. In all our institutions of learning the
German professors stand out as men of in
tegrity and the greatest ability. When, there
fore, we appeal to our German fellow citizens
in the name of decency, honesty and Independ
ence In public life we meet them upon a cOm
mon ground, because no man can be decent,
honest and Independent in public life unless
he is scrupulously exact about the decency
and cleanliness of his own household, and this
Is a characteristic we are all proud to note
in our German fellow citizens. After all con
servatism is. an anchor to windward which
keeps the power of city government \u25a0 straight
breasted against the walls of agitation and
discontent, and conservatism in the United
States is to a great degree founded upon 'and
rests upon the domestic,' sound, conservative,
honest Independence of our German fellow citi
zens. - . , \u25a0 . â¢ \u25a0
Charter About to Bear Fruit.
The charter, ladles and gentlemen, which was
planted about two years ago, is about to bear
fruit. It has yet scarcely appeared above the
earth. But the indications are, ladles and gen
tlemen, that If it is nurtured and cared- for as
It. should be It 'will prove a strong and vigor
ous tree, beneath which we can all rest in
peace and prosperity. (Applause.) . "\
And the question that . confronts us now Is
whether, having planted that tree, and having
fairly inaugurated its growth, we shall aban
don it to the storms and to the turmoil of the
weather. Gentlemen, shall we glide back into
the pool of stagnation, debauchery and political
corruption out of which we have struggled at so
much cost and 'at so much sacrifice? (Cries
of "No.")
"We who have lived in ! Sari Francisco know
its history has been the history of political cor
ruption;. that decency In the City Hall : has
been a thing almost unknown; that Justice in
the City Hall, when a man had neither pull nor
power, was almost a thing unknown. For the

Gentlemen, this la ) no political question. Is
deny that on or about October 8 he con
tracted with Van Drake's Machine Works,
a non-union concern, for the performance
of work upon materials sent to him by
the J. H. Therelns Laundry Machine
Works. These are uncontradictable facts
and sufficiently show the false and dis
loyal position of Eugene E. Schmitz. We
challenge him to show the books and rec
ords of the above mentioned concern and
prove by this evidence that while he has
espoused the cause of labor and used
unionism as a means to further his polit
ical ends he is a concealed foe to those to
whom he poses as a friend.
When we know our enemies and they
fight In the open we have an even chance.
But when the non-union supporter,
masked in the garb of a loyal unionist,
mingles with and attacks us under cover
by extending support' and patronage to
non-union establishments, then destruc
tion hovers over us.
'Union men, consider well these state
ments. They are specific and in detail.
If not true, they can be disproved. But
if they are true, then Eugene E. Schmitz
is not entitled to the support of a singla
laboring man in this city.

He has done nothing for labor*. I did what I
could. During the recent labor troubles I sub
scribed what little I could afford toward the
support of those out of employment. I gave
some of them work. I sent to strike headquar
ters and offered employment to as many wo
men and men as I could arrange for. But why
talk about thit? The man mat made the
charge has practically withdrawn it.
The Labor Union ticket Is in the interest of
one class only. The Republican ticket sprung
from a tainted source. What we want is a
decent, honest municipal government and we'll
get it by supporting the officials that have
been in power during the last two years. My
parting advice to you is to vote -with an eye
to the future of San Francisco and not to the
future of any political party.
I never made any such statement or anything
like it and I'd like the people that said I did
to come on this platform and tell what they
have ever done for the workingman. I am
referring to that very honest (?) and decent (7)
citizen who edits a certain evening paper.
The only thing in my official career that my
enemies could discover was proved to be that
thing old as the Garden of Kdenâ a lie. These
opponents turned the searchlight of investiga
tion uson the records of my public acts and
this was all they have found.
I never said $1 50 was sufficient pay for a
day's labor. . ,
I never said $2 was sufficient pay for a day s
labor.
ONLY DISCOVERED A LIE.
The most enthusiastic greeting of the
campaign awaited Tobin at Teutonia Hall,
1322 Howard street. The audience was
composed of residents of the Thirty-first
and Thirty-fourth districts. When the ap
plause had subsided he spoke as follows:
The cordiality of your reception I feel to be
the most sincere I have yet met with. I am
delighted at having had the opportunity during
this campaign of meeting the people of thesa
districts twice. If I am elrscted I shall not for
get that to your enthuslaatl: support I owe
much of my success. In a campaign like tms.
rigorous and severe as it is. you have no idea
how invigorating is the enthusiasm of kind
friends. This enthusiasm. I am glad to say. l
have met with during the whole course of my
campaign. * . ,
Duiing this campaign I have Been accused of
the heinous crimes of enjoying physical exercise
and having a weakness for keeping my person
reasonably clean. After all.' however, these
charges involve nothing of moral turpitude ana
my plea of guilty still leaves me the right, to
deem myself a decent citizen. |
EVERYBODY INTERESTED.
Bvery man in this and other districts that
pays his taxes is interested .in preserving the
value of property and that depends upon the
election to office of conscientious, painstaking
officials. â¢ _
I have yet to speak as Republican or Demo
crat. The appeals I make are addressed to you
as citizens of San Francisco and as ProPf^:
owners. What's the use of talking P ol "' cs
when it is business we are interested in? This
issue you must decide as men, and as man to
brother men I leave It in your *ands.
Is .an item appropriating $60,000 for the Im
provement of streets in the north end of town
and for repaying Stockton street. t
Gentlemen, there is nothing
this. It is simply a matter of P*!* 0 * \u25a0*H5, t Â£:
It involves no principle of politics or economics
and to the officials who apportioned that sum
you are indebted in just that amount'
there Dolitics, is there Democracy, is there
Republicanism, is' there Labor Unionism in
keeping your streets clean, in lighting them.
In cleaning the City Hall? Gentlemen. It is a
simple proposition, and it la for you to decide
as God-fearinc, honest men who are interested
in the welfare of this city. (Applause.)
Upon another point, ladles and gentlemen.
If after years of labor and toil In the factory,
before a furnace, in the streets,' in .the noil
of a sh!Â» or in the back room of an oftU-e
you have amassed a thousand, two thousana
or three thousand dollars, earned from, tne
labor, of your body, do you take that one, two
or three thousand dollars and give It to the
president of a labor union to invest for you?
Or do you take it to a man who knows how
to Invest money? You would take It to a- man
who has been brought ud as a business man
and knows, where that money will rest in
safety and. security and be earning you a just
rate of interest. JDo you invest It in a mine,
or do you invest it in some good Interest- pay
ing bonds? Gentlemtn. the question presented
to you is the same upon this election, is tne
city of San Francisco's trust of less signifl
cance than the one or two or three thousand
dollars that you may save? Gentlemen, re
member this, that any man in this audience
if ho saves $500 does not take It to a labor
union to invest for him. The city, of San
Francisco is worth more to any honest, pa
triotic citizen than any amount of money, no
matter how harshly and how hardly It may be
earned. . v
What the Real Question Is.
The question Is In whose hands will the city
of San Francisco be safe and who will conduct
the city of San Francisco in a manner redound
ing to the benefit of the city. We are not here
to talk about politics. We are not here to dis
cuss -political economy. We are not here to
talk about labor unionism. Mark me, gentle
men, I have nothing to say against the per
sonal repute of any man upon any ticket. I
respect them all and as I treat them I hope
to be treated by them; but at the same time
gentlemen, let me point out where think
their principles are false, where I think the
platform upon which they rest Is badly built.
This Is all I come before you for. This is
what I am upon the stump for. and, ladies and
gentlemen, if we have expressed to you can
didly, honestly, fairly, temperately our posi
tion, then we hope to receive at your hands
just consideration and a fair, candid judgment
upon November 5. I thank you for your at
tention. (Applause.)
The crowning insult of the wretches
who had evidently been sent to the meet-
Ing for the sole purpose of disrupting It
was advanced when Charles A. Zinkand
arose to deliver his address. â¢ Mr. Zinkand
began his 'remarks, but they were unin
telligible In the hail of billingsgate that
belched from the gallery. After making
several vain attempts to make himself
heard Mr. Zinkand retired in disgust.
Three cheers for Tobln and the whole
Democratic ticket were given with hearty
good will. The meeting then adjourned.

It will be seen that flu wonder-working magician who made Wells pu!l down his ulti

Wells is taken out of the lean and slippered pantaloon and transformed mio a rugged
man clert in mind and body, white Tcbm is taken out of the heyday of life and also out of
his trousers and is squeezed into knickerbockers and set to spinning tops.
Presto, change! The Bulletin debases itself to the occas on, cashes up, swallows it

all Janus-faced, and reading the Bulletin before and after taking may conclude to do as
they please. ; j
BEFORE.
Bulletin Editorial, Oziober 10. 1901: fl
Peculiar problems arc involved in the choice
between candidatesâ problems that were hardly
foreseen a month ago, when the local Republican
leaders felt certain of victory and were jubilant,
and the Democratic organization had the blues so
badly that candidates were shy and even the
most reliable shouters silent. hva month the
situation has been changed. :
Wells has lost much of the energy he for
merly possessed. The office of Mayor under the
new charier is arduous and exacting and de
mands of its incumbent a great deal of energy.
On the other hand, Joseph S. Tobin is in the
very heyday of life, an athlete, a gentleman of
excellent mind and education, a lawyer, a
banker and a very clean, approachable and pop
ular gentleman. He is not a politician and is
under no obligation to the Democratic machine,
to which he is doing a considerable favor by run
ning. It must be admitted that the nomination of
Mr. Tobin has cured his party of the blues. It
must be admitted also that the Republican ticket
is weak in its candidates for Supervisors. Too
great confidence of Republican victory caused
the party leaders to nominate for Supervisors a
body of unknown men. Many times, many
times, the people have rued the careless citizen
ship and partisan enthusiasm which led to the
election of insignificant and unknown men to the
Board of Supcrisors. Mr. Wells h tinsel f saw
that the Republican leaders had made a mistake
and zvetit ei>cn to the point of delivering hfi ulti
matum that unless a change zuas made he would
retire from the ticket; but when the leaders ig
nored his protest he withdrew his ultimatum
and gave his benediction to the ticket. This act
of weakness will probably militate against Mr.
Wells, for a Mayor, under the charter, must
be both strong and independent. The people have
had a taste of honest administration of the mu
nicipal finances and have enjoyed a period of free
dom from corrupt bosses; they arc aware of
the extreme importance of selecting -an indepen
dent and alert man for Mayor, and for that rea
son they are puzzling over the situation.

sic Hall. The fight was for the middle
weight championship of the "West. Root
was a decided favorite. Ryan, who has
but one eye, forced the fighting, but Root
blocked him throughout and Mn the first
round had him at his mercy\and ham
mered him on the blind side continuously.
Ryan forced things through the first half
of the second round until Root landed
twice on his chin, when' Ryan began to
stagger. Then Root saw his man going
and landed a swift swing on the point of
the chin and Ryan fell like a log, the ref
eree, Bat Masterson, counting him out.
It was about fifteen minutes before Ryan
recovered consciousness.

The Santa Fe Railway last year was
bt-diy handicapped by the fuel question.
33<yond Mojave the company was unable
to secure coal owing to the closing down
of the Clarke coal mine by a strike. This
Ftrike has been settled anfl as there is a
j>l?ntiful supply of coal it is expected that
the fruit trains will be able to make fa^t
time to the East.
For the first time in the history of rail
read affairs in California the Southern
Pacific and the Santa Fe railways have
made a compact in reference to the price
to be charged for hauling fruit to the
Eist. The story leaked out yesterday
that the roads had come to an under
standing and there is no little prospect
of fruit shippers securing a lower rate.
.'.t is expected that this will prove a
prosperous year for fruit growers. The
ra.!!road companies have estimated tnat
they win haul 25,000 cars loaded with fruit
to the Eastern markets. Last year there
was a great scarcity of fruit cars ar.d
miich fruit v/aÂ» spoiled owing to a lack
of cars to carry it East. This difficulty
will not bo encountered' this year.

Mrs. Kincaid stated that the city of

After persistently denying the charge
that the schools are overcrowded, the

novel plan to relieve any congestion that
may exist in the various districts. 'At

dent Klncald stated that It Is intended
to build a movable or portable school
house of from eight to, twelve rooms as
tho exigencies require. This building will
be moved to sections whÂ«re the attend

situation.
Barry, was. arrested last 'night and his
name was placed on the small book at the
City Prison pending an examination Into
the case by the police. : -. ; ;-:
Barry was taken in charge by, the police
after the death of Gilbert and will be held
pending an investigation. ,
Gilbert â¢ never regained consciousness
after being taken to the hospital the sec
ond time and died shortly before mid
night: - ':\u25a0\u25a0' ~' \u25a0 V '..â¢ .. - i
The facts of the case are those: Shortly
after 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon P.
Barry, who is a clerk in a grocery and
saloon nt 814 Howard street;, discovered
a man making off with a coat that he
had left in a back-room. He seized the
thief and a battle ensued. The two men
fought all ove.* the premises until' Barry
succeeded In knocking his opponent out.
He then called for Policeman G. K. Small
and that officer had the beaten thief con
veyed to the Receiving Hospital, where it
was found that his nose had been frac
tured and his left ankle sprained. .After
the physicians had attended his injuries
the man. who said he was Walter Gil
bert, and that his -residence -was at 13
Pearl street, was taken to the City Hall
prison, and locked up on 1 a charge
of attempted burglary. , When the
officers started to search him they
found - that he was wearing \u25a0 two
coats. Subsequent investigation proved
that the under coat was the property of
Edward Duffy, a plumber residing at 522
Eddy street, who had been working about
the building where the fight between
Barry and Gilbert took place. This dis
covery led to a charge of larceny being
preferred against Gilbert. v
After Gilbert was locked uo two other
prisoners were brought to the jail and
incarcerated In the cell with him. When
Policeman Lynch, who has. charge of the
keys, made his round shortly afterward
the two prisoners said Gilbert was acting
queerly and they thought he was crazy.
As Gilbert talked rationally to Lynch
he paid no more attention to the matter.
. At 7 o'clock It Is customary, to- move
some prisoners to the Hall of Justice and
when the police approachea the cell they
found Gilbert lying on his face on the
floor. He was breathing heavily and. was
unconscious. The other two prisoners
were asleep. x *
.Gilbert was hastily returned, to the Re
ceiving Hospital. The doctors -say there
was no evidence of Gilbert having a'frac
tured skull when he- x was first brought' to
the j hospital and they are inclined to . the
belief that he received the fatal injury
Vy a fall In his^ cell. The police have
been unable to .learn much, of the ante
cedents of Gilbert. At 13 Pearl street it
is said an ex-soldier who. went by the
name of Jack Fitzgerald resided for a
time. Letters came for j him, addressed ' to
Walter. Gilbert. ; ij . â¢ . - ::
Walter Gilbert, an alleged burglar, died
late last night in the KÂ«ceiving Hospital.
The doctors are not certain whether, his
ekull Is fractured, and tho pollco. are, not
certain whether his condition is .tho re
sult of a beatliB administered to him by
â¢P. Barry, a clork, who caught htm whilo
ho was attempting to steal a coat, or
whether he received t"ho injury which
caused his death by a fall in the prison
cell. \u25a0 "

well did they respond.
A large number of Graying firms in the
city have' their stables in this vicinity.
There are several large breweries, a big
vinegar and pickle factory, a large shoe
manufactory and other minor Industries
located near the hall. From this large
army of wage workers residing in these
districts was Urawn the greater portion
of the assemblage. ' Royally did they wel
come Schmitz when he entered the hali,
â¢and vociferously did they cheer him when
the speaker told them that "Hayes Valley
was just as dear to him as North Beach
or the Mission."
All the interest of the meeting centered
Jiround Schmitz. The workingmen gave
;iim a mighty cheer, and paid close atten
tion to his speech. He was frequently in
terrupted with applause. He spoke in
Jjart as follows:

"I am on the executive board of the
Coremakers* Union. H. Bell, a member
of our union, went to work Monday. On
Tuesday he wrote to the secretary of the
Corereakers' Union, Charles Straub, ask
ing if Kinnaird & Barrie was a union
shop. JThen Straub brought his letter
down this afternoon to the union head
quarters and said it was not a union shop
and to call him out. He said there were
'scab' movers .working there. I went in,
accompanied by Martin Gray and Edward
McGibney, and saw Bell, and I told him
to come out, and he asked me if it was
not a fair shop. I told him no, it was a
non-union shop. I saw him working on
some cores which he said were for Eugene
E. Schmitz and for that reason he thought
it was a union shop. I asked him what
letters were on the castings and he told
me 'E. G^E.,' which is the Economist Gas
Engine Company's trademark. The core
he was making was for a cylinder for a
gas engine. I asked him if he was sure
about this being for Schmitz, and he said
he was told that by the employes in the
shopâ that it was for Schmitz.
"After 12 o'clock Bell went out to get
the rods from the casting' and found that
the casting had already been sent away.
I asked Bell how he obtained the position.
He told me that Mr. Smith of the Liberty
Iron Works, a non-union foundry, camo
to him and told him to go down there,
that there was a job and it 'was a fair
shop."

Admiral Besumes His Account of
Flying Squadron Operations.
WAS^HINGTON, Oct, .20.â With the opening
of the Schley court of; inquiry to-day Admiral
Schley began the fifth day of , h(s testimony
and the third day of: his- cross-examination..
The testimony began where left oft yesterday,
taking up different phases of the blockade of
Santiago and passing from that question Into
the reconnolssance of May 31, when the Span
ish cruiser Cristobal Colon was bombarded.'
The battle of July 3 was left for the last sub
ject. to,be considered.. \u25a0 . ; \ -.
The first question Captain â¢ Lemly asked was
whether the Iowa was with the flying squadron
at Hampton Roads when he gave the captains
of the . ships the verbal orders as to attack
ing the enemy's fleet.' v ; Admiral Schley replied
that she was not. In response to questions he
said that he first fell in with the Iowa oft
cienfuegos. Paptain Evans was then 111 and
Commander Rodgers was in command. He did
not recollect whether he had communicated
the verbal orders to the latter. He first saw
Captain Evans on May 29. " \u25a0
He was then questioned as to his conversa
tion with Captain Folger when the latter sug
gested a circular blockade such as existed at
Wel-Hai-Wel. Witness said he thought" the
fleet was lareer than his ' at Wei-Hal- Wei.:
He was asked whether he did not .consider a
circular blockade with the vessels pointing: Iri
as mobile as the other form . in that ships
could move either way by â¢ turning with the
lielm. The admiral replied that he thought, a
circular blockade where all the vessels charged
to the center would produce confusion and In
evitably lead. to. a. " different arrangement ac
cording as the enemy* -moved east or west.
"The outcome," 'said he,- "could only be more
or less : confusion, such as did 'actually 'occur
later."'. : :\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.:' \- : - \u25a0~>.;S- '-'?Â£ â¢'â¢"'â¢" '
- The 'admiral's attention ' was called' to Cap
tain Folger's " statement that . the latter had
udvls'ed him. to go in closer at Santiago and
his own statement in chief that on the next
day Captain â¢ Folger had signaled them that
they, were within range of the batteries. The
admiral, in reply, changed the date of the sig
nal to a day later. He read .Folger's signal,
"I think the forts may op<!n~ at this range."
He said ' when Folger made this signal â¢ the
squadron was In practically the same position
as on the day Folger testified he had asked
the admiral to go in closer. Witness' atten
tion was then called to his statement that
neither at Cienfuegos nor Santiago had any
vessel entered or departed and he wan asked
how he knew this. He \u25a0 replied- that he only
knew It because he never heard of any ship
getting In. On. the North Cuba blockade when
a Frenchman succeeded in getting through the
blockading line into Havana the fact had been
widely advertised as a great accomplishment.
His conclusion, therefore, was that none had
Â«ntered. " :. - . â¢ â¢ â
Coming to the reconnoissance of May 31.
when the Spanish , ship Colon was bombarded
it lay in the harbor at Santiago Captain
Lemly asked. Admiral Schley when he first
received notice that the commander' In chief
would be at Santiago. The witness replied
that the notice had come in the dispatch
brought to him by Captain Cotton, which was
delivered May 29. This telegram was, he said
not received until May 31. Possibly, too, the
New Orleans might have brought information
of the coming of Admiral Sampson.
"Why did you wait two. days after, the dis
covery of the presence of the fleet in the har
bor before undertaking ' your reconnolssance?"
"For the reason I had. used those two: days
for coaling the vessels of . the . fleet : so ' as . to
be prepared in ' case the ; enemy should come
out." \u25a0 \u25a0 ..,,-â¢â¢>: r

Relating the occurrences of the bombardment
he said he recalled that Captain Hlgrginson had
asked after he (Schley) went aboard the Mas

poned until after dinner. he warned
some people to' get oft I the* turrets and that
Lieutenant Commander | Potts : had given | notice

DUEL BY PARENTS V,
COSTS CHILD HER LIFE
One of the most interesting features of
the day was the development of the fact
that the report of the battle written by Ad
miral Schley July 6, 1898, -was not the
original report. The original report never
has been published, and in accordance
with a previous decision, the court de
clined to .: permit it to be Introduced into
the record. Admiral Schley was allowed
to explain, however, that Admiral Samp
son declined, to receive, the. first report
because-it did not mention the presence
of the New York.
"I felt that the victory at that time,"
said Admiral Schley in explaining the
matter, "was big enough for. all and; I
made this change out of generosity and
because I knew that if the New York had
been present she would have done as good
work as any other vessel."
Captain Thomas Borden, of the Marine
Corps, who was aboard the Brooklyn, will
be the last witness called for Admiral
Schley. : After he testifies to-morrow
morning the judge advocate general will
put on the stand the witnesses for 1 re
buttal; of whom there are understood to
be about fifteen, and it is probable that
Admiral Schley's counsel will call sev
eral witnesses in sur-rebuttal.
The judge advocate's cross-examina
tion to-day covered the retrpgrade move
ment, the reconnoisance of May 31, the
loop of the Brooklyn and the alleged
colloquy with Lieutenant Hodgson about
the Texas. :

cross-examination was', concluded and he
was allowed to leave the witness stand.

merit, the recdnnoispanee of ; May'31, the
thirty-four questions prepared by the
members of the court, These questions
touched many points of the campaign of

about the difficulties encountered in coal
ing and the reasons for the retrograde
movement. ; Not one of them related to
the battle of Santiago. v -' \u25a0
Admiral Deweyâ The court has decided that
it had better Â£>e drawn out- In some other way.
We have ruled out all - papers not sent. , \u25a0
C. Mr. ' Raynorâ This was sent. This Is not the
report that was sent to. the. telegraph office. \u25a0-
Admiral Deweyâ Oh. I beg your pardon.
."â¢ Captain Lemly and Mr.;Raynor continued the
discussion for some time. The judge advocate
charged that Mr.' Raynor' s purpose was .'to In
terfere' with the cross-examination. Admiral
Dewey finally put an end to the discussion by
saying that If- there was no objection to bring
ing :â¢ in â¢ the L report at > another time I it - could . be
brought -in at -. thU ; point * : Thereupon '-Captain
Lemly, withdrew his point. -,\u25a0\u25a0,\u25a0 :,
.'.'The damage . has â¢ already -been done."- .he
In answer to a question* he said he supposed
the captain had given'the order. \u25a0â¢ He was not
certain. His attention was called .to a -letter
of.June 13,'. 1000,' written, from 'the South At-'
lantic ; station,' in which" the admiral was quot
ed as saying that the turn was made to avoid
the' last attempt. of the Viscaya to ram, but
as the : letter could not be produced at the
time he was 'not questioned upon it. .'His at
tention was next directed aa his letter to the
Seriate, in which he. said the turn was made
to avoid blanketing the fire of his own ships,
and also to. his statement In examination in
â¢chief that he had not. turned tp port because to
do so _would have brought the ship Into dan
gerous'' proximity to . the enemy's vessels and
exposed her to possible torpedo attack or ram
ming. '.. '.V \u25a0 â¢ â¢. - ! \u25a0 .- " .â¢,<"\u25a0
..\u25a0 "Now. ' -eald Captain Lemly, "there appear
to be' three reasons why you made the turn.
Why did you make that turn?"
"As I already stated in my direct testimony,
there is another very much more important
reason which you have not asked, and that was
the ship might. continue in the action and beat
the enemy as we- did. j That was the controlling
one of all."
"Have you stated that?" asked Captain
Lemly. \u25a0 â¢ , ' .
The witness replied: â¢_' \u25a0 \u25a0
"I never stated that because I thought it
was evident. I stated it for three or four rea
sons we could perhaps conjure up about it. I
have them in mind. â¢ I have stated in relation
to the Senate document that the matter was
prepared very hurriedly, and here I stated the
general purposes the movement was intended to
accomplish."
"Did you have much of these various rea
sons in- ml cd at the time?". â¢â¢
"Probably all of them and others."
The judge advocate then took up Admiral
Schley's report of the battle made to the de
partment, dated Guantanamo Bay, July 6, 183?,
and he was questioned concerning the state
ments made therein, attention being called to
the statement that after the Viscaya struck
her colors the signal was made to cease firing
and the following sentence: "The Oregon hav.
ing proved vastly faster than the other battle
ships, she and' the -Brooklyn, together with the
Texas and another vessel, which proved to be
your flaKjhip, continued westward Jn pursuit
of the Colon, which had run close inshore, evi
dently seeking some good spot to beach if she
should fail to elude her pursuers."
-"You wrote that?" " \u25a0- \u25a0\u25a0'â¢ -' â¢â¢ , -.'\u25a0'<\u25a0.
\u25a0 ."Yes," replied Admiral Schley, ,-Vand I can
explain the : whole thing if you will admit a
preliminary report that was returned." -
\u25a0 "I have no objection to your preliminary re
port unless it comes under the rule that it was
not sent." â¢ ."â¢ ' ". "â¢â¢â¢-. . .

Admiral Schley, in response to a question,
sail he never heard of the Texas Incident until
two months after the battle. He had 'been
under the impression until later that the star
board engine of 'the Brooklyn, -was-. backed to
facilitate the turn.-. "He recollected distinctly
that he warned Captain Cook --as the enemy"
approached > that they were' going to" ram him.
t|e was closely . questioned- .as to â¢â¢ the - order
which went below "to, stand. by to'ram.". , .
The witness said that before the helm of
the Brooklyn was swung- hard aport in order
to make the loop, the helm was put alternate
ly tp port and. to starboard In order to meet
"the movements of the enemy's ships.
"It was. difficult,", he said, "to say at this
time whether they meant to go between the
Texas and the. Brooklyn or the other way." .
. "You stated in your examination Â» that in
â¢making the turn you did not see the^itarboara
of the Texas?"
\u25a0 "I did say so absolutely." . \u25a0
Famous Loop Once More.
"When the Spanish ships succeeded in get
ting out of the harbor without being sunk, in
accordance with orders, what alternative waa
there but to chase them?"
"There was no alternativeâ no other course
was open, but much depended \u25a0 upon the char
acter of the chase. Whether It was made in
Â»he proper way and' was effective was one
hing, while a poorly conducted and Ineffective
blockade would have been another thing;."
The admiral said. In reply to questions, that
while several of the vessels had failed to Join
jn the chase. leaving the work after .the sink-
Ing of the Teresa and- the Oquendo to the
Brooklyn and the Oregon, this was because
they could not follow at the pace set by 'the
Spaniards. At this point Captain Lerrily intro
duced the following paragraph from Admiral
Schley's report dated Guantanamo, July 13,
1S9S. â¢ .
"Since reaching this place and holding: con
versation with several of the 'captains, viz:
Captain Eulate Of the Viscaya.-and the second
in command of the Colon. Commander Contre
ras, I have learned. that the Spanish admiral's
scheme was to concentrate all fire for a while
on the Brooklyn and : the Vlscaya to ram her,
in hopes that if they could destroy her the
chances .of . escape would be greater, as it was
supposed she was the swiftest ship of-' the
squadron. This explains the heavy fire men
tioned and the VIscaya's action in. the earlier
movements of the action. This purpose", wa*.
promptly defeated by the â¢ fact that all the
ships of the squadron advanced into close range
and opened an Irresistibly furious and terrific
fire upon the enemy's squadron as it was com
ing out of the harbor."
Admiral, Schley identified this paragraph as
a part of: his report. '..--,
during the battle given the signal to follow the
flag. Admiral Schley replied:-, -.<
"I think I have kept my mouth pretty, close"
on all these subjects and do not recall speaking
of this incident. I distinctly, recollect giving the
signal and that it was 'flying for two minutes."
"Did the Brooklyn stand In and attempt to
sink the Spanish fleet in the channel?" â¢â¢" " â¢--
"I started in at first to help the other vessels
and to have them help me. I felt if we could
stop the Spaniards the battleships could go in
and sink them. "I never had any idea that they
would get away." . . . -
Continuing, he said in reply to questions he
estimated that the Brooklyn had gone into
within a mile to a mile and a half of the
mouth of the harbor and was within range of
the shore batteries. He thought that for from
twelve to fourteen minutes the flagship had
been within a range of less than 2000 yards
from the Spanish ships. "They looked very
close," he said.
The admiral said in response to questions that
he had not mentioned the loop in his report of
the battle. It was ah incident of the battle
which he : had no Idea would . ever . come .into
controversy. Captain Cook had. given the order
without orders \u25a0 from him except under his gen
eral instructions to close \u25a0 in and keep j some
where about 1000 yards away, outside : of the
broadside torpedo range.. \u25a0: When, the time came
for the 1 turn \u25a0"\u25a0 Captain I Cook's conception \u25a0 of
the movement ' coincided, with; his own. Al

Captain Lemly at this point passed to the bat
tle of July 3, stopping to ask one or two inci
dental questions about the circumstances of the
evening of July 2. On July 2. when the - sus
picious movements were seen in the .harbor of
Santiago the witness said he talked with Cap
tain Cook about the advisability of coupling up
the engines. It was 'decided not to do so. He
supposed the ship; was always ready for a sor
tie. Admiral Schley's attention was called to
Captain Cook's testimony that on the night of
July 3 he turned In with no intimation that
the fleet would come out. The witness said that
Captain Cook's statement was not in any sense
inconsistent with his. He had. no intimation
that. the fleet would come out. :
"Referring again to the alleged signal not. to
go in closer,' Admiral Schley said he did riot
consider It probable that If sent -It- "was sent

â¢Captain Lemly asked him why the" mouth' of
Santiago harbor, had not 'been enfiladed and all
the ships used on May 31; , Admiral Schley re
plied that he had done so 'simply because the
batteries would have been safe while the ships
used thus would; have been placed in greater
dancer. : ; -.â¢â¢.\u25a0,\u25a0\u25a0-...â¢ â¢\u25a0 ~

have made that we did not make. The coaling
was so important and had been so strongly
urged by the commander In chief, â¢ I felt we
should lose no opDortunlty in putting the ships
in the highest condition of efficiency." he. said.
, "Why did you not steam more slowly as you
passed the mouth of the harbor?" .
The witness replied: \u25a0
' "Well, that is a technical error that might
have been remedied if some one else had been
in command. , Possibly the firing would have
been effective if we had gone in closer, but if
we had and had steamed more slowly there
wculd have been no gain, as the range would
have been narrower. It. was a case of tweedle
dee on the one side and of tweedledum on the
other."
Was Anxious to Fight.
The judge advocate then asked the admiral to
tell what his purpose was on that day and what
instructions he had given.. Replying that he
had testified fully on this subject before, he
said the ; signals made indicated the purpose.
The signals Instructed the shlpS to use their
big guns against the Colon. The New Orleans,
with her lighter battery, was directed to fire at
the shore batteries. The instruction was to go
in ' 7000 yards and he thought for several days
afterward that ships had gone in to that dis
tance. ; . \u25a0
"X- directed the ships to follow the flag-, to
operate against the Coion and to flre against
the forts to develop them and I think the. recon
nolssance, so far as It went, was eminently
successful. The batteries were developed and
the fact was demonstrated that the enemy was
in port. With a squadron of only five or six ships
I believed that only the strongest military ne
cessity would have Justified me In risking the
loss of a vessel that might have reduced the
squadron to a numerical force inferior to that
of the enemy. If one or two of our ships
had been crippled the enemy might have come
out . and engaged us with disastrous results.
The developments of the facts as to the batter
ies and ships was. In my opinion, sufficient.
The enemy's ships. could not get away and they
did not cet away."
The admiral was then asked whether he had
Informed Ensign Macy, Captain Cook and Cor
respondent Graham -that the affair of May 31
was to be a reconnolssance. He thought he had
in. a general way and he thought he could be
fairly said to have informed the captains in
the signals hoiBted. - .Â» \u25a0'â¢\u25a0
"Did you signal. to the commanding officers
that it was to be a" reconnolssance?"
"No. I think not. I think I signaled that
we should go in and fire our large guns."
"Did the affair develop without question the
presence of the enemy in the harbor?" ;
"I thought so, because of the large shells
fired at- us and also because a number of , ves
sels were seen."- \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0: \u25a0 .; .-; â¢\u25a0â¢â¢\u25a0- â . . -: â¢\u25a0
"Incidentally, yes."
The admiral then, at the request of the judge
advocate, read what he wrote to the Senate.
The letter contained the precautionary order
of the department at the opening of the war.
He again explained, as he had done before,
that when he wrote his communication to the
Senate he did not have.^all the records before
him. He omitted to mention in that com
munication, he said. Admiral Sampson's cau
tion at Key West. He had. prepared it largely
from memory. In further support of his po
sition the admiral read the department's in
struction of May 13, specifically warning the
commander in chief against risking his vessels
to the flre of the land batteries. He was cross,
questioned closely as to all the orders bearing
upon this subject. He said he had never seen,
until he saw them, in the report, the orders of
April 16 and April 2S, modifying to some ex
tent the original order. But he .had been ad
vised of their purport. . â¢
"In your report of June 1 to the department
concerning, thy recpnnoissance you did .not
mention-any purpose to sink or destroy the
Cojon?" 'â¢\u25a0-.:. : ? Â».
"I did not."
"But in your telegraphic report you did say
that your purpose v/as to destroy the Colon?','
have paper and! pencil at hand while a battle
Is in progress and- as a consequence there is
a failure to record -.many . recurrences that
should be recorded."' - >". ; \u25a0 \u25a0 '-
Here followed an examination of the various
signals from the Massachusetts oil the day of
the bombardment, \u25a0 which the admiral verified.
At the same time he remarked that he thought
there were' other signals unrecorded.
Admiral Schley said he had ordered the
range at 7000 yards for- that day, but he had
not supposed the Colon was so far up the
harbor. , . .
"Of course," he said, "I left the measure
ment of the range to the executive officer.-"
"Does your letter to the Senate, dated Feb
ruary 18, 1899, plead the precautionary order of
the department for not destroying the Colon?"
"I should rather think that Is the infer
ence."

Leon Czolgosz was pronounced for the
boy the priest indignantly refused to pro

there was placed in evidence Â«the telegram
sent by Admiral Schley to the department July

to assume entire credit for the victory of
July 3 and that It belonged to thÂ« fleet under

N. W., WASHINGTON, Oct. 30.
âEvery effort is being made by
the United States to induce Tur
key and Bulgaria to refrain from
taking action against the brigands who
hold Miss Stone captive until the woman
has been released. As soon as her liber
ation Is accomplished, then evidence will
be collected establishing the responsibil

The State Department received addi

the brigands who have Miss Stone In
their possession and her friends who are
acting under the supervision of Spencer
Eddy at Constantinople and Consul Gen

At 3:30 p. m. Admiral Schley was finally ex
cused and 'there being no other witnesses pres
ent the court 'adjourned until to-morrow.
"It could have gone to Jamaica, but I should
imagine, the fleet could have gone sufficiently
south to have prevented the Spanish fleet, front
reaching Havana." - \u25a0
'.'Where could the Spanish fleet have talced
refuse it it came out and steered to the south
ward?" " -" â¢
In reply to a question Admiral Schley said
he thought his conversation with Captain Cook
concerning the uncoupling of the Brooklyn's
engines had taken place on July 2.
He was satisfied some of the shots from the
forts were from eight-Inch guns; that the Mer
rimac had been required to use her own. ma
chinery as soon as repaired, and that the chief
engineer of the squadron had reported to him
the injury to the collier.
The last question was as follows: '. : .
"I intended to use the large guns for that
purpose, expt_tlng to make another signal be
fore boarding the Massachusetts, which I did
when I told the New Orleans to lire at the bat
teries."
Admiral Ramsayâ Tou gave four motives for
the retrograde movement. These motives do
not appear clear to me. . . .
"I telegraphed mainly regarding the coal sup
ply because I Imagined it would be the most
important motive. I do not know that I gave
my reasons for it, but I did In a subsequent
dispatch stating that the movement to the
westward had been for a certain object."
"If it was your intention on May SI to de
velop the Spanish shore batteries why did you
signal that you were going in with the three
ships, the Massachusetts, the Iowa and the
New Orleans, only to flre on the Colon?"
"If you were governed in making the retro
grade movement by the motives you have
stated why did you send to the department the
dispatch of May 27, 1S98. which you gave to
Captain Cotton to send in cipher from King
ston?"
"That is a very difficult question to an
swer."
"Dick you consider Captain SIgsbee's report
that he had not seen the Spanish squadron and
the pilot Nunez's statement that the Spanish
ships were too large to enter the harbor of
Santiago proof that the information given to
you by Captain McCalla on May 24 that the
Spanish force had been reported in Santiago on
May IS and were still there on. the afternoon of
May 24 was erroneous?"

order of May 23 and why he considered It am

tion in direct examination. _
"Was there any shortage or coal at n.ey
West?" â¢â¢ :
by the brigands that a greater sum than
$35,000 cannot be raised.
There is no foundation for the report
that President Roosevelt sent a message
direct to Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria
regarding Miss Stone. "While the depart
ment deprecates the Interviews attribut
ed to Consul General Dickinson, It states
that he has acted with zeal in the mat
ter. Particular credit is given to Eddy,
who. it is officially stated, has displayed
marked energy and ability, and his con
duct has received the cordial approval
of the State Department.
Beyond the determination to obtain rep
aration as soon as Miss Stone is liber
ated, the administration has formed no
plan of action. There is absolutely no
question of a naval demonstration in the
Black Sea. Certainly the authorities
have not sounded the powers on any such
point. 'All the department Is sure of Is
that Miss Stone was captured on Turk
ish territory a few miles from the fron
tier by Bulgarian brigands, who immedi
ately retired Into Bulgaria, and it is not
prepared to formulate its policy regard

Melick and a committee hired a hall
and the Assemblyman addressed a mass
meeting in the Interests of annexation.
The "antis," represented by C. C. Brown,
unsuccessful candidate for council last
spring, attempted to take possession of
the floor and Melick â¢ talked all evening
to keep possession. It was a lively meet
ing, full of personal and political antag
onism. Those opposed to annexation
countered by hiring the same hall them
selves a week later and Brown made a
fiery speech, attacking Pasadena's new
city charter, her officials and her govern
ment in general; endeavoring! to show
that the larger city was not - worth an
nexing to. By request, Melick, who was
present, replied, defending the charter, j
The annexationists will go ahead, mak
ing plats of the territory to be annexed
and placing the proposition before the
voters, very shortly. The Council j and
Mayor are enthusiastically in favor of ex
pansion. South Pasadena has been In
vited to come in and later the district
east of the city will likely be annexed. '
PASADENA, - Oct., 30.â A movement
started by ex-Assemblyman Walter S.
Mellck â¢ for the annexation of North
Pasadena to Pasadena proper has started
a wordy war. The district proposed to
be annexed is about two miles square and
contains several hundred ; thousand dol
lars', worth of property. A committee can
vassed the district and found 114 voters
In favor of annexation and 78 against it.
Some of the anti-annexationists are
terly opposed because taxes will be heav
ily Increased. , The annexationists reply
that property values will also be increas
ed, and the territory will have street
lighting, sewer, fire department,, police
protection, etc.

MOVEMENT IS STABTED -
FOR A '\u25a0 GREATER' PASADENA
The Defiance had moved out into the
stream off the lumber dock and was
quietly moored there yesterday morning
at 3 o'clock, the expectation being that
a tug .would arrive at daybreak to tow
her to sea. At that hour she was sud
denly boarded by ten men, who had ap
proached her so quietly that their pres
ence was unknown to the vessel's lookout
until they clambered over the sides. "With
out any ado the intruders hurried to the
forecastle and covered the non-union sail
ors with revolvers. In a few moments
their clothing had been gathered up and
thrown overboard into a fishing - boat
which was tied alongside the big schooner.
Without being given a chance to dress
the non-union sailors were hurried on
deck and put over the ship's side injo
the fishing-boat. The invaders jumped. in
and with muffled oars rowed across Grays
Harbor to a small, barren island near
Ocosta, where the sailors and their be
longings were put ashore.. The kidnapers
jumped into their boat again and rowed
off in the fog without saying a word.
â Then for the first time the unfortunate
sailors had a chance to put on warm
clothing. One of the crew used a log
and -, paddle for transporting himself
across the channel from the island to the
mainland. He took the first train. from
Ocosta around the harbor to Hoquiam and
notified the captain of the Defiance just
as the latter was about to leave the shore
with- his tug. en route to sea. The tug
was dismissed and after procuring a gaso
line launch the captain crossed Grays
Harbor, rescued his men and took them
back to Hoquiam.
The . only arrest so far Is that of Martin
Knute, an engineer on the steamer A. F.
Coats.. The officers have a clew as to the
other kidnapers and other arrests are ex
pected.
One of . the (boldest and most skillfully
carried out movements on the part of the
Sailors' Union occurred yesterday morn
ing at Hoquiam. The details did not
reach Tacoma until late this evening; as
an effort was made . to keep the facts
quiet until arrests could be made. The
schooner Defiance, owned in San Fran
cisco, had loaded a large lumber cargo at
the mill of the E. K. Wood Lumber Com
pany at Hoquiam. Her destination was
Suva, Fiji Islands. Her captain had ob
tained a non-union.^ crew and expected to
sail yesterday forenoon without difficulty.
All of his men had come aboard and on
Monday night the last of their clothing
and outfit was pat over the ship's side.
TACOMA, Oct. ' 30.â The fight between
union and non-union sailors continues un
abated on the North Pacific coast. For
months the warfare has been going on
almost without interruption between ves
sel owners and their/ non-union employes
on the one hand, and the Sailors' Union,
with . its attempt! to raise and maintain
wages, on the other.

â¢ The Queen left Nome on October 23 In
a blinding snowstorm.,. "Winter had -set
in in earnest " and the , thermometer had
been steadily falling during tfce previous
week. The steamer had a good voyage
until within, the last forty-eight -hours
before, reaching Cape Flattery,, at which
time she was overtaken by a windstorm
directly astern. â¢ The gale rose to forty
six miles an hour and the seas ran high.
The culmination came. on Monday night,
when " the ship \ took ; to rolling heavily.
At 4 o'clock Un' the morning she took a
final plunge and a , turn, which - for ..the
moment threatened to roll her completely
over. She rolled, over -to .the port side
very nearly beyond the point of ;turnlng
back. ' At : the â¢ sanie ; moment . she was
struck amidships by . a tremendous ; sea,
which stove in somÂ« -of the- staterooms,
broke ' in the doois of .' the main saloon
and Bent tona of water into the dining sa
loon, pantry and kitchen and. flooded the

out and to add to the confusion and dan

excited passengers "/raised : the cry A of

while she was anchored in the roadway at

The new steel bridges - were put In at :
crossings where the Iron showed \ evi
dence of crystallization, owing to the ac
tion of the weather and the heavy strain.
The spans taken out of the iron bridges
were shortened and strengthened in the
shops at Sims and sent to other divisions
to be used again.
Next summer more iron bridges may be
replaced with steel, but the main work
through- the canyon proper will consist
of replacing the present rails with heavi
er ones, i The first improvement suggest
ed by Charles M. . Hays when he - went
through the . canyon was that j very heavy
rails must be laid. He stopped, the re
placing of 60-pound rails with 70-pound
Ht.Chcstnut;- saying that the entire "dlvi
pion from Red Bluff to'Dunsmulr must
have even | heavier rails than thativ His
ideas, it is understood, are to be carried
out.;
This work done on the rails and bridge*
this summer has prevented a \u25a0 repetition
of last summer's series of train disasters,'
but It has been done at enormous cost.
The last bridge to be replaced Is that
at Elmorei The Iron frame has been re
moved, the false work put In and the
plates are going In for the steel bridge. .
While seven or eight of these : big
bridges have been replaced, there has not
been an hour's delay of a single train
on account of the work. The railroad
company has this most delicate of con
struction work reduced to a marvelous
system atd the most extensive replace
ments or, repairs have been successfully
cdnducted without Interference with traf
fic.

SACRAMENTO, Oct. SO.â Albert Grubbs.
one of the oldest colored citizens of Sac
ramento, died at his residence to-day
after a long illness. Grubbs was a native
of Kentucky and was a slave. He claim
ed that he was one of the body servants
of Henry Clay and that he closed the
eyes of the great orator and statesman
when he died in 1SS2. .
Closed Clay's Eyes in Death.
Evidence of the robbery was upon them
and Conway positively identifies the three.
Ti-ey gave their names as Frank Moran,
Michael Gratz and Ed . Harrington. All
are young men and say they are from
San Francisco. â¢ " : â¢â¢ '.
About a quarter of a mile out of town
the train became "stuck" oh a heavy
grade. The officers, who had been at the
depot, rushed up to find that the murder
ous trio had somehow got out of the car
and were running across the country.
They started in pursuit. The trio turned
and fired. The officers exchanged shots
and eventually caught .their men.
As they started to investigate the waist
band of his trousers Conway made a
dash for the open door and jumped from
the train. The robbers fired two shots at
him as' he leaped, but neither took effect.
He caught the caboose of the fast run
ning-, train and surprised the trainmen
with his bloody appearance and story of
the robbery. A stop was made, the three
men locked in the car. Redding officers
were telegraphed to and a run without
steps was made to this city. , /. '
The crime was replete with spectacular
features. Harry Conway, a miner, was
returning on a freight train to this county
from Idaho. At Grants Pass, Or., yester
day he grave money for a meal to three
"hebces" who were on the same train.
The sight of a few dollars in silver in
his hand was evidently an incentive for
their subsequent attack upon him. . ; ..,
Somewhere near Castella, in this coun
ty, last night Conway was awakened In
his boxcar by the three men with a torch.
Each held a pistol. One grasped him by
tin. throat * and beat him terribly about
the head with, his weapon. They then
searched him, finding a gold watch and
52 50 in silver. They overlooked five $20
gold pieces in a bag inside the waistband
of bis underclothing. :-...'. \u25a0:. 'â¢ â¢;.
First they wanted him to jump from the
car as It was passing over a high bridge.
Then they debated whether or not to kill
him outright. In the meantime the trestle
was crossed. They decided to search him
further nml then kill him "and throw him
oft." the train. v -
REDDING, Oct. 30.â There was a run
ning fight between officers and thugs here
at 8 o'clock this morning when an at
tempt wae made t6 arrest three men who
bad robbed and bea,ten a fellow traveler
o"n a railroad train. Half a dozen shots
were exchanged, but no one was hit. The
rotbe'ra were arrested. \u25a0 . \u25a0
The Yaauis went from this rancho to
Kt=peranza, the rancho they attacked a
few days ago. There they destroyed the
houses, shooting through the windows
first to drive out the occupants. For
tunately the owner and family had not
returned since the raid of a few days ago.
The attacks were made at midnight and
it v.as no doubt the intention of Jhe
Yaquis to murder a!l ranchers in that val
ley, but most cf them had fled when the
Yaquis first beg:un to raid the settlements
Â» 'veek ago. A dispatch from - the
Tomatal ranch to El Correo de Sonora, a
paper published in Guaymas, says there
wer; a large of Indians In the
band, all well armed. Settlers began to
lea\e their homes more than a week ago
End lew ranches in the valley are inhabit
ed, swing to the fear of the Mexicans that
the Yaquis are determined to . kill and
plunder as long as there are no troops to
fight them. It is not known whether
there is u definite plan arranged by the
Yacuis or not and the Mexican people
seem to believe that these bands are made
up Df desperadoes.
At any rate the raids are becoming more
frequent and almost every day some
rancher Is killed. This week four have
beei murdered. .. â¢
The Yaquis yesterday visited the To
matal rancho, where they destroyed much
property, stole the corn and took away
horsses and mules. Luis and Carles San
che:;. who operate the rancho, escaped
after being lired at several times. They
made their way to the Santa Ursula
ranoho and the Indians followed them.
They had been there but a few minutes
\u25a0when they heard the Indians approaching.
They ran for their lives, but Jose Ramado
raid he would stay and protect his home.
The Indians were upon him before he
could tltfend himself.
TUCSON'. Ariz.. Oct. SO.â Information
\u25a0was received at Guaymas to-day that
ban-is of Yaqui Indians had visited sev
eral ranches near there and at the Santa
I'rsula rancho had Idled the owner, a
prominent rancher, named Jose Ramado.
The Indians were reported to be going
toward Guaymas and it was feared that
they would attack the washerwomen, who
begin thrir day's -work at the break of
day along the river. A posse was formed
in Guavmas to go to the river and warn
the women of the presence of the Yaquls
in that locality.

LONG HAIR AND SHORT HAIRâ
A. A. W.. Alameda, Cal. The custom of
men cutting or having their hair cut 13
believed to have been inspired by the fol
lowing from,! Corinthians xl:14: "Doth
not even nature itself teach you that if
a man have long hair It is a shame unto
him?" Homer wrote of the long-haired
Greeks by way of honorable distinction.
Subsequently the Athenian cavalry and
all Lacedaemonian soldiery wore long
hair. The Parthians and ancient Per
sians wore long flowing hair. The Franks
and ancient Teutons considered long hair
a. mark of high birth. The Goths looked
on long hair as a mark of honor and on
short hair as a mark of thralldpm: so did
the Gauls, for which reason "Julius Cae
sar, when he subdued them, obliged them
to cut their hair short in token of sub
mission. In Englanc\ Jhdges, the Speaker
of the House of Commons and at one
time the Bishops, 'wore long hair, while
criminals and paupers wore .short hair.
On the other hand Jewish priests during
their time of service had their hair cut
once a fortnight, and Roman slaves wore
their hair and beard "long, but shavedV
their heads when manumitted. Sallor<A
who escaped from shipwreck shaved theWTi
heads 'as if ' manumitted from the sea. In
Ezekicl v:I there is mention of a "barber's
razor," with instructions to'"thou son of
man to cause It to pass upon thine head
and upon thy bear fi."
One of "the most . remarkable and puz
zling stories of somnambulism is that
which recently came to light In connection
with a young clergyman: at a training
college in New -York, who was found to be
in the habit of writing his sermons while
fast asleep. The young man would get
out'of bed, secure paper, and compose and
write his sermons:, On finishing a page he
would read it out, when a word displeased
him he would write .a correction j with
great \u25a0 exactness. These somnambulistic
sermons were well composed and correctly
written. Curious to ascertain whether
the young man made use of his eyes, the*
principal of the college put ' a card ' under
his chin to prevent him seeing the paper,
but he still continued to write. , *
Not yef satisfied whether . or hot 4Â»e
could distinguish different objects placed
before' him, the. principal "took .away the
piece of paper on which . he wrote and
substituted several other kinds, at - dif
ferent times, of various colors. He always
perceived the change, -because the pieces
of paper were 'of different sizes. -, When a
piece exactly like his own was substituted
he used ; it, and wrote his corrections on
the places corresponding to" those of .iis
own paper. ; : It was by \u25a0 this means that
portions of his nocturnal compositions
were obtained. . I , j :>
His most astonishing production was a
piece of music written with great exacti
tude. â¢ He' used a' cane for; a ruler. TJie
clefs, the flats and the ' shajps were all
in.their right places. The notes were all
made as: circles, and ; those .requiring; it
were afterward blackened with ink. The
words .were J all written â¢below, but once
they were in such .very large characters
.that they/ did- not come directly ;1 below
their t proper notes,', and,. perceiving this,
he ; erased them all and wrote them over

Booker T. Washington's dinner - with President
Roosevelt has set the people of Washington to
searching for precedents, with the result that we have
ttones of Lincoln, inviting Frederick Douglass' to"
lunch and of Jefferson inviting a negro -- mathema
tician named Banneker to dine with him at the White
House, which Banneker did. The most curious story
of all, however, is one to the effect that a year or so
ago Representative Sprague of Massachusetts invited
his colleagues of the' District of Columbia Committee
to dine with him, and the invitation included Mr.
White, the negro Representative from North Caro
lina. When the invitation of the colored man became
known every other member of the committee sent his
regrets on account of. a previous engagement, and the

THROWING SHOESâ W., City. The
custom of throwing one or more old shoes
after the bride and groom either when
th$y go to the church or when they start
on their wedding tour is so old that tbe
memory of man stretches not back to the
beginning. Some think It represents an
assault and is a lingering trace of the
custom among savage nations of carry
ing away the bride by violence. Others
think it is a relic of the ancient law of
exchange or purchase and that it former
ly implied the surrender by the parents
of all , dominion or authority over the
daughter. This was a Jewish custom:
thus in Deuteronomy xxv: 5-10, we find
that the widow refused by the surviving
brother asserted her independence by
"loosing his shoes"; and In the story of
Ruth it is told that it was the custom In
exchange to. deliver a shoe in token of
renunciation. . It was the custom in
ancient times to place the husband's shoe
at the head of the nuptial couch in asser
tion of his domJnaUon, and that lite as
sumed the government of the household-

"UNCLE SAM"-H. L., City. Uncle
Sam as the .representative ! of the United
States has no other name. During the
last days of the Revolution there was a
contractor named Samuel Wilson, who
received the stores for the army and navy
of the United States and when such were
sent to him they bore the letters "U. a."
for United States. Some one asked the
meaning of those letters and an individual
responded that as the goods all came to
Sam Wilson they stood for Unc'e
Sam. In that way Uncle Sam was applied
to the United States.

home. When you take a glass of beer is not in ; issue. At your age, and it is an honorable
age; an occasional glass of whisky may do you no harm. But the people don't care when
you take a drink. What they want to know is where you take your orders.- They want
to know who ordered you to stay on the ticket when you said you would go off. Who
was it, Mr. Wells? Don't confuse the issue by talking about swilling swipes or clinking the
cannikin. We will admit that you take the occasional glass of beer arid red liquor, and
will not dispute that your domestic supply of liquor is no common stuff. We admit its

In the same speech, you introduced another issue by boldly declaring: , "One place

are gentlemen in this city who have done business in one place forty years. They aiso

DOGS ON BRIDGEâ J. S., Yerba Buena
Island. Cal. The reason that dogs are
not allowed to cross the Niagara Falls
suspension bridge unless carried is that
they are a nuisance on a bridge and those
in charge of the bridge have a right to
suppress a nuisance. A dog crossing a
bridge, ad lib., Js an irresponsible creatur3
and not controllable. Being such, a doc
might be the cause of an accident that
might result seriously. It Is to prevent
accidents from such a cause that dogs
are barred.
THE OLD CLIFF HOUSEâ Old-timer.
City. Captain James G. Foster was in
1860 a member 01 the firm of Foster, Pat
ten & Tcrrey, owners cf the Interna
tional Hotel, on the north side of Jack
son street, between Montgomery and
Kearay. On June I, 1S63, Captain Foster
took a lease of tbe old Cliff House and
continued in charge until January 1, 1SS4.
The law of the State empowering Boards- 'of Su
pervisors to levy taxes for bonded indebtedne'ss says
that money obtained thus shall be applied to no other
purpose. The charter denies the transfer' of 'such
funds to any other fund or use. -The Supreme Court
has decided that the elections and proceedings upon
which the levy was based were illegal. Notwith
standing all of which law, Mr. Wells claims to have
saved the fund and Mr. Shortridge supports him in
the claim and with an oratorical flourish describes
him as the watchdog of the treasury^ who saved for
us the $223,000. : ' .
At present it is out of reach of the Auditor and will
remain so unless by legislation or by an order of a
court he be authorized and empowered to draw war
rants upon the fund to which it stands accredited by
force of the tax levy under which it was taken from
the taxpayers: .Until some legislation or court ac
tion be had it is more . than â¢ likely that this money
intended for a! sinking fund vvill be. found to, be a
sunken fund.' \u25a0' : .\u25a0'.-' \u25a0 \u25a0'. ' '" : - .\u25a0"â¢â¢\u25a0 j> ) \u25a0; : : .
In making that claim Mr. Wells and his orator are
doing something very much like trying to obtain
votes by false pretenses. Last year a tax was levied
to meet an appropriation of $208,500 to meet sinking
fund and interest account of six months on contem
plated bonds for panhandle and other proposed im
provements. From the statements made by Wells
x and Shortridge it appears the tax levy paid into the
treasury the sum of $223,000, an amount much in ex
cess of the appropriation. The money* was collected
by the Tax Collector, was paid by him to the Treas
urer, and should now be in the possession of that of
ficial. The Auditor has had no opportunity nor occa
sion to .save: it He is neither its collector nor its
custodian. \u25a0 He is merely cognizant of its being in
the treasury." ; \ "
A'MONG the few intelligible utterances made by
'Mr. Wells in this campaign is a claim that it
is due to him that $223,000 has been saved to
the city ' treasury. The claim has been repeated by
Mr. Samuel Shortridge, who in a speech at Metro
politan Temple said: "We hear of a surplus of $223,
000. * * f The Board of Supervisors sought in
every "way to secure the money, which had been set
aside for the payment of interest and bonds, the final
judgments against the city and of . the outstanding
funded debt. Who saved this money to the city?.
It was Asa R. Wells. He, the watchdog of the treas
ury, saved that surplus."
SEPARATE PROPERTYâ Homestead,
City. Not knowing all the circumstances

property of the husband, no more than

ANARCHISM AND SOCIALISM-L. S..
East Oakland, Cal. The difference, be

the former favors the abolition of all

the abolition of rank. Anarchists and so
cialists are anarchists and socialists* the
world over.

From this table it appears that the
movements of the head are always of
shorter duration than those of the body.
In some insects, says Signor Canes
trini, the head and body remain extreme
ly sensitive up to the las>t instant of life.
A cricket, if lightly touched, will raise
itself immediately, and, if touched more
titan once, \u25a0will jump about. That the
head is still alive is shown by the move
ments of the antennae. A moist and con
genial temperature tends to preserve the
softness and vitality of the head and
body, whereas a. dry and .warm temper
ature soon makes them rigid, fragile anil
insensible. This is most clearly seen in
the case of crickets and grasshoppers,
for, "if these Insects are decapitated in
cold â¢ weather and are then placed in
moist ground they will live milch .longer
than they would If they had been decap
itated in 'warm weather and had then
been placed m dry ground.

Collecting a number of insects, lys cut
off their heads and then carefully noted
\u25a0what took place in each case. Some of
insects made no voluntary" motion
after being decapitated, but when touch
ed or pinched g^ve every sign" of life.
The crickets remained on their feet ip a
natural position, even when headless, but
most of the other victims rolled over at
once on their backs. Lively insects, like
bees and ants, remained almost com
pletely motionless after they had been de
capitated, and -not until some time had'
slapsed did they seem to "realize" that
they had lost their heads.'.
The most surprising . fact, however, is
that Signor Canestrini saw butterflies fly
eighteen days and a few crickets jump
thirteen days after decapitation and he
even says that the insect known as man
tis religiosa moved quite freely fourteen
days after its head had been removed:
The following table shows how Ion? the
various insects decapitated by him con
tinued as 'a ruleâ Â«for a' few crickets
showed much greater vitality than is here
indicatedâ to move their heads and their
ing on th.em and especially with
the object of ascertaining to- what extent
motions are made by a body after the
head has been separated from it, Signor
Canestrini, an Italian scientist, thought
that it would be worth while to make
similar experiments on insects, and for
several months he has been devoting Kis
attention to this work. .?. Â«r .
KNOWING that the Academy of
Medicine in Paris usually obtains
the bodies of . decapitated crimin
als for the purpose of experiment-

The expressions at the class meeting on Tuesday ; simply " emphasize our advice
given. early in this campaign. It is evident to every observer that Mr. Tobin is the only reg
ular T candidate who can win, and he only by general support of the community. This is a.
time for entire frankness. We perfectly, well understand what it means for us to openly give
this advice against the infuriated leaders of the class movement, but we understand as
clearly that our advice is as much for the protection and prosperity of the men led by
those leaders as for any other members of the community. We have^ toward them rio
such malignant feeling as their leaders express toward us and the merchants, manu
facturers and business ifien of this city. We realize clearly that in defeating their perni
cious class ticket' the city is saving them. We want them saved, and for that reason advise
the plumping of votes. If a Mayor is- elected to carry out the views - and principles ex
pressed by them on Tuesday night, San Francisco will not sbon^ recover from the blow,
and labor will be the first and longest sufferer.
With what light* we have and guided only by a desire for>-the. city's) welfare, and to
further the interests of the whole community, we regard the support of Mr.<Toj)in as the
only means of escape from the peril threatened by the savage agitators.
Early in this campaign we called attention to the danger implied in the running of
any class ticket. We again sound the-warning. Of course that ticket can receive only a
minority of the total vote, but if that minority be a plurality, a plurality elects, and let no
one hope that the savage threats made by those Infuriated leaders will be forgotten, or
the vengeance-' for which they thirst be left unexecuted.' ;-\u25a0' ; . _ '*. .
; - * -The Registrar, estimates that the total vote will 'be about. 56,000, a great reduction
upon the registered vote. In that' vote it is possible for 18,800 votes to .elect, a Mayor,
and under the charter the Mayor is the government. He ; can dismiss without charges
every governing board in the city. He can make over new the police, school, public
works and civil service boards. He can thereby change the" Chief 'of Police and the entire
force. In fact under the charter system every officer and employe in this city practically
holds office subject to the will of the Mayor. Even the civil service regulations are pow
erless to protect the' classified service against the rapacity of a Mayor- who demands that
his "class" shall run the government of the city in its exclusive interest.
None of the speakers'* understood- or practiced the noble rhetoric of understate
ment. Those mistaken men selected the worst social conditions known to history and de
clared the- conditions in this country to be Ayorse than any heretofore .known by ,man.
Every speech was a distinct declaration of war upon society. This was done with. a bitter
ness of. invective and a surplus of vituperation seldom heard in a public meeting. It is
true, of course, that'the speeches were made by the defeated leaders in the recent strike, a*nd
were therefore naturally in the form of a demand for vengeance. s The attacks made upon
the officers of the law, for enforcing it, were savage to a degree that should teach all sen
sible and law-abiding people that government cannot be jsafely entrusted to men in whose
behalf such things are said: 'V ; -- ; :
- â¢â¢ One of the speakers declared that "industrial absolutism," whatever that is, had. led
to "political absolutism," whatever thatis, and ' "brojjghtcabbut;:- conditions which ren
dered possible, a Coxey's army, walking across alkaU'deserts (to civilization."
All such stuff goes with the people ,to . whom -it is addresseci; It-is a gross and seri
ous misstatement. The conditions that began in 1893 "were not local to" California. They
were general throughout the Union. The panic of- 1893 had ruined tens of thousands; of
employers and suspended the employment of labor.. To say that this was a local condition
only is untrue. Coxey's army was organized inOhio, by a; political charlatan, and did not
march. across alkali deserts; it lived on the cpuntry-fordwhile on. its way to Washington
and there evaporated. This speaker says it marched -to civilization, implying that it started
here under uncivilized conditions, and crossed -alkali desertsto better things.
But the absence of truth and logic made no difference to the meri that listened, and
who became enthusiastic when told that-they are slaves.^^l]he .candidate ; for Mayor de
clared specifically that the police would not be -permltteli' !to : protect workingmen from
violence on trucks and drays. If not on trucks ariddrays,' .where else?'. '\u25a0< ; : \u25a0 \u25a0'. .
A T the mass-meeting held by the candidates on^the- class ticket at Metropolitan
- /\ Hall on Tuesday, all appearance of interest in the whole community was aban
/â\ doned, and the ticket was put forward in the interest of a supposed distinct class,
* . * ; which has chosen to create itself and in politics to separate itself. from: the rest oi
the people '

'â¢Charles Bergerhoff, a German, living at
333 Harriet street, has decided after a trial
extending over several years that he can
not live in peace and joy with his Irish
wife and has evolved a unique method
for freeing himself so that in time he
may be mated with a lady of his own na
tionality, whose temper will be &ver calm
and unruffled and who has no knowledge
of the art of vituperation. The measures
which he has adopted, however, have
worked such hardship on his wife and
children that an appeal has been taken
to Secretary White of the Society for the
Prevention 'of Cruelty to Children.
Domestic infelicity, as both parties to
the dispute agree, has reigned long over
the Bergerhoff family. A short time ago
the husband was arrested for chasing his
wife down the street with a chair leg for
the purpose of convincing her that his
opinions, arid his only, were correct.-
After that unfortunate episode and the
disagreeable complications which ensued
he, declared his intentions of making her
leave him. Accordingly he .appropriated
to his. own use one of the three rooms
which the family occupied and placed a
heavy padlock on the door. Gradually the
provisions were moved into this room un
til the rest of the family became desti
tute. To insure control of the food sup
ply, Bergerhoff slept with the flour, but
ter, eggs, potatoes and* other eatables.
His isolation was. almost complete,- al
though occasionally he would dole out
enough to his family for them to' keep
body and soul together. ' y '
A day or two ago this connecting bond
became so thin that an improvement
seemed urgent and assistance was asked,
and the suffering wife told all the fore
going facts to the Society for" the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children. Officer
McMurray went to the house yesterday
morning and states that- he found the
woman's story was true. He told her that
under the lav/ she was entitled to a part
of the provisions and advised that she
seize them forcibly. An ax was procured,
the padlock was broken and the mother
and children secured the food. Secretary
White of the society states that Berger
hoff will be arrested and the future of the
children will be looked out for.

In the Divorce Court.
Murdock admitted that a number of pa
tients had been removed from the asy
lum yesterday and expected more to : go
at once. A new corps of nurses was in
stalled yesterday. \u25a0,. 'â¢\u25a0".- *.
It is true that I owe the nurses some money,
and I (ruess that I ought to Day them. I don't
owe Dr. Frizell a cent, for he was goinc to
work for three months for nothing, and then
we were going to see what he was worth. '
As to who constituted the Board of Di
rectors Murdock said he could not tell.
"I have put some money into the insti
tution/''he said, '-nearly aU I have. -I
think John Russell, at present at San
Jose, and AV. G. McCarthy, whose where
t> bouts I do not know, is another one. I
will have to refer you to the articles of
incorporation for the i others."
As to Blumenberg's connection with the
institution Murdock was as illy advised,
although he admitted' that Dr. Bussing,
the new resident physician, had been em
ployed by Blumenberg at his Pine-street
establishment.
Murdock has been employed at various
times at Agnews and the Oregon State
Asylum as ward attendant and night
watchman and has had similar experience
in English and Scotch asylums. He says
he telephoned yesterday to Dr. Windele,
informing him of the trouble, as he court
ed Investigation, but was unable to reach
him. Murdock says he did this on '\u25a0â¢ the
belief that he was the proper man, al
though' he is merely a local examiner .of
the insane. . " :- .â¢'. '.-
**You ought to. see the food they give
the patients." chimed in the nurses in
chorus. "We would not take it to them
sometimes, it was so bad."
"Miss Dugan, who has been but four
or five months In the business, put up
all the medicines 'until I stopped her,"
t-aid Dr. Frizell.,. "None of these nurses
nor myself have been paid since we went
there, although one or two of the girls
were specially engaged, to take care of
the insane patients. The statement is
untrue that any one of the nurses left
the French Hospital on account of the
trouble, although Miss Crap was em
ployed there during that time."
Superintendent Murdock was very reti
cent when approached about 'the matter
yesterday. He said:. ' â¢
Here Is one case where the law should step
in. Mrs. T. Schnerr of 1330 N street,- Sacra
mento, has a dauffhter in the institution for
whom she is \u25a0 paying $95 per ' month. Hef
mother recently visited her and the young
woman was riven a room on the lower floor.
As soon as the mother left the daughter was
placed in a room in a corner of the top floor
and left there without a bed or mattress. ' Her
mother has been notified and is expected down
to-nigh; to take her daughter away.
There is also the case of Mrs. Vice, 87 years
of ace, . who* is dying from cancer. One of
these nurses saw Miss Dugan and Superintend
ent Murdock slap her in the face. She com
plained and begeed to be taken away, or else
allowed to die in peace.
About ten "days ago Dr. Hatch, accompanied
by Blutrenberg- and Otteman Stevens, came out
and inspected the institution. Everything was
arranged for their benefit, and when Dr. Hatch
tsaw my diplomas, which were displayed in the
office, he ordered the Issuance of the certifi
cate, which bears date of October 23. Since
that time the trouble has commenced. /
I am coins to brine this matter to the at'
tentlon of the State Board of Lunacy. The
way Datients are treated there is a disgrace.
S. P. Blumenberg, who was connected with the
Hotel Nymuhia, and runs a so-called-dispen
sary on Pine street, near Kearny, is the head
of the affair, although Alexander Murdoch: la
the manager. .
Although only in effective operation for
six weeks and with a license from the
State Board of Lunacy Commissioners
only a week old, the St. Elmo Hospital
at Eighteenth and Douglass streets, has
come into an undue share of notoriety.
After the discharge of Dr. ( J: F. Frizell,
the resident physician; three nurses and
a male attendant, tales are being- told of
the treatment accorded patients that do
not reflect credit upon the management.
Dr. Frizell left the hospital yesterday
morning with his wife and Misses Crap,
Brannan and Read, nurses, and Edward
Smith, a male attendant. Dr. Frizell,
acting as spokesman, has unburdened

PLAIN TALK .
To Catarrh Sufferers.
Every person suffering from catarrh in '
its many, forms knows that the common
lotions, salves and douches do not cure. It I
Is needless to argue this point or to cite
cases of failure, because every victim of
catarrhal trouble knows It for himself if i
he has tried them. - â¢ ;
A local application, if It. does anything '
at all, simply gives temporary relief; aj
wash, lotion, salve or powder cannot:
reach the seat' of the disease, which is !
the blood. . ' .- j
; The mucous membrane seeks to relieve ;
the blood of catarphal poison by secreting |
large quantities of mucus, the discharge
sometimes closing up the nostrils, de-
scending to the throat and larynx, caus-
ing an irritating cough, continual clearing
Of the throat, deafness, indigestion and '
many other disagreeable and persistent
symptoms.
A remedy to really cure catarrh murt
be an internal treatment; a remedy which
will gradually cleanse the system from,
catarrhal poison and remove the fever and
congestion always present in the mucous
membrane.
The best remedies for this purpose are
Eucalyptol, Sanguinaria and Hydrastin,
but the difficulty has always been to get
these valuable curatives combined "In ' one
palatable, convenient and efficient form.
Recently this has been accomplished
and the preparation put on the market
under the name of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets; they are large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, so that they may be slowly 'dis-
solved in the mouth, .thus reaching every
part of the mucous membrane and finally
the stomach and intestines.
An advantage to be considered also is
that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets contain no
cocoalne, morphine or poisonous narcotics
so often r found in catarrh : powders, and
the use, of. which often entails a habit
more dangerous than the disease. ".':
Stuart's Catarrh . Tablets are sold Ly
druggists at 50 cents for full-sized pack-
age and are probably the safest and most
elf ectuU catarrh cure on the market. -

CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Oct. 30.â As a result
of the sessions of the naval general board
and the naval board on construction in
this city an identical programme of naval
construction will probably be submitted
to Secretary Longr. This programme will,
it seems certain, contain provision for
four battleships and four armored cruis
ers, as well as large and small gunboats,
the latter for service In the Philippine
Islands.
The general board proposes to recom
mend the construction of about a dozen
picket boats of not more than 800 tons
displacement and high speed. The need
of such boats was demonstrated during
the war with Spain, when in order, to es
tablish a close blockade of Cienfuegos
ftnd Santiago de'CHba Rear Admiral
Bchley and Rear Admiral Sampson, were
reducedto the necessity of stationing 1 con
verted yachts and unprotected cruisers
Inside the armorclads. .
The board on construction held another
meeting to-day at which the discussion
of the programme considered on Monday
was continued. The board is Inclined to
defer -to. the opinion of the general board
End as soon as the latter submits its re
port it will, undoubtedly formulate its
recommendation. The frequent revolu
tions in South America prove, in the opin
ion of the board, the necessity of having
on hand a sufficient force of gunboats for
cruising purposes along the waters of
Central and South America. . . 1

"Early in September the Marshal received a
telegram from the Attorney General. He re
fused to allow the appointment of deputies . to
meet the lawless situation and stated that local
assistance should be relied upon. On September
14 and 15 there was great excitement in Nome
and it was rumored that the bank of the
Alaska Company was threatened. I told the
Marshal according to the revised statutes and
under the condition of affairs he might employ
additional service. I then â ote to Washing

"Did you give Vawter at that time any
orders about obeying a writ of supersedeas
served upon him?"
"I did not."- :'
"Did you give him an order to swear In a
posse comitatus or to deliver the gold dust to
any people?"
"No, sir."
The witness' denied all orders to Vawter
"State the circumstances that led up to the
writing of your letter to Vawter dated Sep
tember 15. 1900." â¢â¢;.â¢-
â¢ Frost -at that time was introduced to
Joseph K. Wood. He met Marshal Vaw
ter in Seattle before' arriving at Nome,
but McKenzie was unknown to him be
fore August of that year. For a time he
lived at the ' Courthouse along with the
Marshal, deputies and Judge- Noyes, but
as differences arose between Vawter and
himself the former ordered him to move
even at: a time when his wife was sick.
Then followed the story of Vawter's re
quest for advice. He- averred, to Frost
tnat his force was inadequate to cope with
the situation at Nome and earnestly asked
for more deputies. Frost wrote to Wash
ington, stating the request of Marshal
Vawter. This was August 15, 1900.
Attorney Heney. conducted the examina
tion during the afternoon. . In reply to his
first question the witness said:
"After this letter the Marshal and myself
held conversations frequently on the situation
in Nome."

NEW YORK, Oct. 30.â The Times to
morrow will say: The only developments
in the Northern Pacific situation Wednes
day was the appearance^ of the Chicago
and Northwestern in the settlement. As
a matter of fact it was learned from a
representative of the Harriman interests
that the Northwestern has been consid
ered in the settlement from the first. The
Chicago and Northwestern is the Chicago
connection of the Union Pacific and its
interests are closely identified with the
latter. It forms a connecting link be
tween the Vanderbilt and the Harriman
system and Is supposed to be controlled
la the Interest of both. .
Regarding the many rumors about the
Northern Pacific affairs which were cir
culated in Wall street during the day, it is
learned that they are almost all without
foundation. The report that a settlement
would be made before the end of the week
was characterized as untrue by one of the
gentlemen interested In the matter.
The same authority is responsible for
the statement .that it may be several
weeks before the matter can be perma
nently disposed of. When the settlement
shall have finally been made it will be on
a basis which will preclude any possibility
of the questions involved arising again as
disturbing: factors.
CHICAGO. Oct. 30.â The Chronicle to
morrow will say : A new transcontinental
railway system is \u25a0â¢ to be formed. The
Pennsylvania and Santa Fe roads are
planning an alliance. Heretofore the
Pennsylvania's connection to and from the
West has been the Burlington, which has
become the property of the Morgan-Hill
syndicate. The scheme is not a financial
proposition, bnt merely one involving

Estimates are submitted by the Missis
sippi River Commission and Missouri
River Commission as follows: Mississip
pi Commission, $3,476,000; Missouri River
Commission, $1,065,200. The estimates for
local improvements, as made by the chief
of engineers, include the following: Mis
souri River above Sioux City to Mon
tana, $200,000; San Diego harbor. $200,000;
San Pedro Bay harbor, $400,000; San Luis
Obispo harbor, $65,000; canal at the Cas
cades, Columbia River, Oregon, $90,000;
Columbia and Lower Willamette, below
Portland, Oregon. $325,000; mouth of the
Columbia River, Oregon and Washington,
$600,000: Grays Harbor, Wash., $176,775;
Everett harbor. Wash., $177,000. For im
provement of the Yellowstone National
Park, $275,000 Is asked.
General Gillespie also makes an exten
sive report upon river and harbor works
and discusses each improvement at con
siderable length, besides submitting esti
mates for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1903. These estimates are considerably, In
some cases 50 per cent, less than those
submitted by those in charge of the
workâ under continuing contracts, $6,4S9,
677; rivers and harbors (general), $12,543.
600; examinations, surveys and contin
gencies, $300,000; under California Debris
Commission. $15,000; prevention of depos
its In New York harbor, $70,260; enlarge
ment of Governors Island, New York,
$500,000.
For the construction of submarine
mines and storage facilities an estimate
of $100,000 is submitted; for searchlights,
$500,000 fcr InstaJlatlon and $500,000 for
maintenance, and mains and conduits are
needed. The experience at New York
has shown that economy in installation
is promoted by using the fortification
plants for post illumination also. The es
timates submitted would fully equip with
searchlights four more Important har
bors. General Gillespie takes up in de
tail the state of the defenses in each of
the fortification districts, showing just
what has been done during the year at
each point and what Is projected. .
- Money for the West.
An estimate of $300,000 is submitted for
repair of fortifications, which is less than
one-half of one per cent of their value.
During the year negotiations have pro
ceeded for the purchase of fortification
sites in Boston harbor (two>, in Narra
gansett <three). New York harbor (exten
sion of Fort Newton, three sites), Port
Royal, San Francisco, San Diego, St.
Johns River, Fort St. Philip and Cape
Henry, Va. With few exceptions these
places must be procured by condemna
tion. An estimate of $2,000,000 is submit
ted for purchases of sites.

engineers, in his annual report.
He briefly describes the original pro
ject framed by the Endicott Board for

"been amended from, year to year. The
Improvements were the change of rapid
fire eruns and the elimination of armored
defenses. A provision has been made
for emplaclng 325 heavy guns, 327 rapid
fire guns and 376 mortars. Now General
Gillespie wants six more nexr mortar bat
teries and four gun and mortar batteries
and an appropriation of $1,000,000. The
Fortification Board having declared pneu
matic gun batteries obsolete the depart
ment has discontinued work on such bat
teries, as Fishers Island and Port Royal.
C. S. A. .Frost, one of those in contempt,
was put on- the stand. His malfeasance
as charged rests on things said and the
testimony of Marshal Vawter is relied
upon by the amicus curiae to prove the
contempt. It was Frost who advocated

Here ended the Government's case, and
the first witness of the respondents was
called. C. S. A; Frost took the stand and
Judge McLaughlln began' the cross-exam

Frost Mounts the Stand.
Judge Johnson was then recalled for
cross-examination on the famous Jetter,
which Plllsbury produced, and which

Pillsbury's Letter Produced.
"Was there a hearing before Major Van Ars
dale on September 15?" was the next query of
the amicus curlae. â¢ -
"Yes. ,.Â»The question to be decided was
whether the military should enforce the writ.
The request was made by Judge Johnson,
Knigbt and Jackson. It was opposed by
Geary and Dubose. I think, there were others,
but I don't know whether they spoke or not."
"Did you have any relations with Geary
about this time?" ~t
"Major Van Arsdale told me to get a writ

for the non-interference of the military."

bank. French, after replying that he was
in Nome at the time of McKenzie's ar
rest, said: . . . â¢ . .' ' â¢

to give him a force to arrest McKenzle. I
told him that I didn't think violence would be
necessary and that he should make a written
application for the arrest and the securing of
the gold dust. When we first went to the bank
I asked for the keys to the boxes, but they
were not produced and the boxes were opened,
by a locksmith and a chisel."
"Do you remember what position Geary took
in regard to validity of writs."
"I think he said they were properly signed."

almost as soon as the little blisters and
pustules appeared the poison had reached
the blood, and vill break out at regular
intervals and each time in a more aggra-
vated form. \u25a0 This poison will loiter in the
system for years, and every atom of it
must be forced out of the blood before you
can expect a perfect, permanent cure.
A A Nature's Antidote
Poisons,
is the only cure for Poison Oak, Poison
Ivy, and all_ noxious plants. It is com-
posed exclusively of roots and herbs. Now
is the time to get the poison out of your
system, as delay makes your condition
worse. Don't experiment longer' with
salves.washes and soaps â they never cure.
Mr. S. M. Marshall, bookkeeper of the Atlanta
(Ga.) Gas Light Co., was poisoned with Poison
Oak. He took Sulphur, Arsenic and various
other drugs, and applied externally numerous
lotions and salves with no. benefit. At times the
swelling and inflammation was so severe he was
almost blind. For eight years the poison would
break out every season. His condition was much
improved after taking one bottle of S. S. S., and
a few bottles cleared his blood of the poison, and
all evidences of the disease disappeared.
People are often poisoned without
knowing when or how. Explain your case
fully to our physicians, and they will
cheerfully give such information and ad-
vice as you require, without charge, and
we will send at the same time an interest-

Two petitions for a rehearing of the
code case were filed in the Supreme Court
yesterday. One was signed by sixty-nine
prominent lawyers from all sections of
the State and the other by the members
of the Code Commission.
The Civil Code, the Penal Code, the
Code of. Civil Procedure and -the
county government act were all practical
ly declared void about two weeks ago.
Consternation at once seized the framers
of the measures and numerous other peo
ple who were profiting: from the practice
of the new laws. Their, only hope lay in
the petition for a rehearing and in view, of
the fact that the decision of the court was
prompt and unanimous this hope would
teem to rest on a very frail foundation.
Most of the legal lights realize and are
pleased at the. apparent hopelessness of
the case. . . _ .\u25a0 .
A final decision will probably be given
In the course of a few days. .

engaged In the liquor traffic, gave its first
smoker Tuesday night In B'nai B'rith
Hall, and it was attended by nearly 1000
members and friends, who were treated
to a programme after the style of the
Elks' high jinks. Jerome Bassity was
the sire and his assistant was Ike
Deutsch, while a dozen policemen were
busy " between numbers bringing to
the; "bar" of justice" a numbÂ»r

Mr3. Meynell came from London to "this
city with Miss Celia Tobin, who has Just
returned from a trip abroad. The lady
is now a guest at the Tobin home and may
possibly remain here throughout the
winter.
The handsome Tobin home was beauti
fully decorated yesterday afternoon in
honor of the pleasant occasion. Dark
robed, sweet-faced sisters took possession
of the home in the morning and skillfully
arranged the many flowers that were used
to make the home beautiful. A profusion
of greens and long stemmed golden
chrysanthemums were used and the ef
fect was beautiful and artistic. There
was no receiving party. Mrs. Tobin and
her charming daughters welcomed the
guests and presented them to the dis
tinguished lady they were asked to meet.
Mrs. Meynell was attired Jn a magnifi
cent black silk gown that was elaborately
trimmed with lace and chiffon.
The hours of the tea were from 5 to 7,
during wnich time fully '200 people were
entertained. . . ,
During her stay here Mrs. Meynell will
write a series of weekly letters for the
Pall Mall Gazette of London. If is also
probable that the lady will appear before
one of the leading women's clubs and de
liver 'her famous lecture on Dickens.
f I HE engagement was announced
\u25a0 yesterday of Miss Ethel' Keeney
I : and Mr. Tomlinson of New
B. York. While Â»the mere fact of
the betrothal of the popular local
belle and wealthy "New Yorker was not
unexpected still the announcement came
rather as a surprise.
Miss Keeney and Mr. Tomlinson met in
New York last winter. It was, on the
part of the gentleman, a case of love at
first sight. "When Miss Keeney returned
to her home in this city Mr. Tomlinson
followed her out here. How well he
pleaded his cause the announcement of
the engagement shows.
Miss Keeney Is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Keeney and granddaughter
of Mrs." William Alvord. She is extremely
beautiful, graceful, attractive and accom
plished.
Mr. Tomlinson is a New Yorker of ex
cellent connections. He is a member of
the oil firm of Havemeyer & Co.
Miss Keeney leaves shortly to spend the
winter In New York. No date has been
set for the. wedding, which will probably
take place In the early spring.

MRS. ISAAC HECHT paid $50
for a glass of punch at the
gift sale for the benefit of the
Woman's Hospital at the
Palace yesterday afternoon.
It was early, in the day when Mrs. Hecht
marched up to the keepers of the punch
bowl and asked fcf a glass of punch
brev.-ed according to the famous Chese
brough recipe. After she had quaffed
the delicious liquid she offered a $50 note
In payment and pleasantly told the lady
at the bowl that no change was wanted.
Mis. Hecht's example, in a modified
way, was quickly followed by other charl-
ladies present, and so before the
rhoir was two hours old the coffers of the
hospital began to bulge with gold.
I have never seen goods and . wares
more artistically and temptingly dis
played than they were yesterday. All the
ladios at the various tables had their
prettiest frocks and sweetest smiles on
as the excitement that comes from doing
a rushing business brought a pretty and
becoming flush to their cheeks.
Tfcere were eight tables, each with a
splendid display offered for sale, and with
prices marked In plain figures, just like
at all first-class counters. At the bro
cade table I lingered longest.. What glo
rious stuffs those brocades are! My pen
cannot do them justice. They must be
seen to be appreciated. Mrs. A. Chese
brough presided over the brocade table.
ar.d had for her assistants Mrs. Horace
Hill, Mrs. A. N. Towne, Mrs. Rabbins,
Mips Chesebrough and Miss Dillon.
At the punch table. Mrs. Charles Ban
crofT; -was in charge, assisted by Airs. I.
Hecht, Miss Irwin and Mrs. E. Goodwin.
Besiles dispensing th6 punch at this ta
ble, the ladies in charge are raflling off
some: chcice old wines and some unusu
ally handsome rugs.
It is the real Russian tea that one gets
at the Russian tea table, and it is most
delicious. It is brewed. by Mrs. J. Fra
nettz. and served by Miss Franetta, Mrs.
Angclo R. Duperu, the Misses Sandman,
Miss Julia Reid and Mrs. Lester Wells.
I would advise the Doctor's Daughters
to get for their doll show some of those
tiny biPQue ladles in dainty paper dresses
that Mrs. Stokes is selling. There are
fifty little dolls, each one prettier than the
other, and the hats they wear and the
gowns tbey wear are the finest I have
Â«vcr seen. No two of these pretty little
sawdust ladies are dressed alike. Mrs.
StokÂ«-s dressed every one of those wonder-

No little interest was given last evening
to the fair now being conducted in the
hall of the Holy Redeemer Church - at
Eighteenth and Diamond streets by the
presence of John Murphy, one of the six
companions of Lieutenant Hobson in the
memorable act of sinking the Merrimac in
the blockading- of the harbor of Santiago
de Cuba. Murphy, it may be interesting
to ncte, was the only one of the famous
crew injured in the perilous affair. He
Is only recently bax;k from the Philippines.
He Is; a close friend of Father McQuaide,
the pastor of the Church of the Holy Re

bravt:. . He went to the fair last evening
iinhp-alded and unannounced.

Miss Lillian Burkhart has kindly con
sented to appear this afternoon and will
give several recitations. There will also
be vocal and Instrumental music rendered
by some of the best talent in town.
The maple room presented a gay ap
pearance last evening. The spacious hall
was thronged throughout the entire night
by members of the swell set. The court
yard of the Palace was also lined with
carriages waiting for the patrons of the
bazaar, who were intent on helping the
cause of sweet charity.
This evening .the Florodora society
sextet will hold another rehearsal. These
rehearsals will be held every other even
ing until the eventful night is here, so
when the time comes for the performance
the "pretty maidens" and "gentle strang

It Is refreshing to know that Cal Ew-

They have ended a protracted engage

light of the fans. Los Angeles will have
them for thi3 week's series, and as a
consequence there will be some games
worth seeing ct Recreation Park. The
Eacramentos have come to town to meet
the Friscos. Owing to the shortening
days the games will be started at 2:45 p.
m.. instead of 3 o'clock as hereto
fore. Manager Beebe's bluff about bet

The Olympic Club team will go to
Honolulu for a Christmas game with the
Oahu College eleven. C. G. Bailey, a
University of California alumnus, who la
athletic instructor in the college, haa
written to J. Muma, the Olympic Club
football manager, giving him a guaran
tee of all expenses. The Olympic players
will sail some ten days prior to the data
of the game.
The California management received a
telegram yesterday from K. C. Gordon,
the Princeton manager, asking that an
offer of terms for a Christmas game be
made. Manager Decoto will wire an offer
of half the net receipts, with a guarantee
of expenses, contingent upon California" 9
success in the game with Stanford. The
cost of bringing the Princeton team out
would be about $5000, but as this would
be the first appearance on the coast of
cne of the "Big Four" teams it is be
lieved there would be no danger, of finan
cial loss to the university guaranteeing
expenses to the visiting team.
The offer comes to California through
the Influence of "King" Kelly, Califor
nia's old coach, who is head football
coach for hl3 alma mater this year. It
is the first time that the manager of one
of the "Big Four" has asked for a defin
ite offer of terms.
A definite proposal has come from
Princeton for a Christmas game in San
Francisco with the University of Cali
fornia team. The Berkeley men are will
ing provided they win In the big game
November 9 with Stanford. If they lose
it . Is probable a game between Stanford

V of a Big Ring of
Boodlers.
In the Judicial proceedings which cul
minated recently in the indictment of
Customs Collector Hoey of the port of
Nogales by the United States Grand Jury
at Tucson, Ariz., David D. Jones, official
interpreter of Chinese for United States
District Attorney Marshall B. Wood worth,
acted a prominent part. He was detailed
by request of the United States Attorney
General at Washington to proceed to Tuc
son and assist the officers of the Govern
ment as interpreter for the Chinese wit
nesses and in translating Chinese letters,
etc., produced before the Grand Jury.
For more than a year past Chinese have
been landed at Guaymas, Mexico, then
taken overland and passed across the line
at Nogales into the United States. This
was in pursuance of a conspiracy, at the
head of which was the Collector of Cus
toms, and the members of . which* were
receiving large sums for landing Chinese
from Mexico. The ring was exposed by a
line rider named Webb. Webb was a cus
toms inspector, detailed by Collector Hoey
to guard a- portion of the frontier by pa
trolling it on i horseback. He. thought !t
strange that, he was never able to catch
any. Chinese crossing the line and that
certain points were kept out of his itin
erary.. So one day he disobeyed orders
and rode in a direction-opposite to that
which he had been ordered to take. He
bagged seventeen Chinese attempting to
get Into the United' States. Then the
matter was taken up by the United States
authorities. Secret Service Agent Dickie
and United States -District Attorney Mc-
Lamore of Texas were detailed to uproot
the ring, which they succeeded in doing
admirably. One of the chief conspirators
and boodlera, Chinese Inspector Josey
blew out his brains when confronted with
the evidences of his guilt. He had been
a church leader and posed as a very re
ligious man.

Interference of Overall and Albertson won
California's first touchdown.- For the re
mainder of the game, California's better
condition, shiftier playing, better punting
and runnlng-in of punts, and better in
terference on end runs, made - its play
clearly superior. Except for. an occasional
lapse, the Nevada line was strong, fully
equal to California's. >.'

went in at half in Mini's place, and he
was given the ball In hope that he might
skirt the end for a touchdown. Big Rior

him and caught him back of the line for a
loss. The game ended with the ball in
California's possession in the -center of
the field.

HARBIN SPRINGS, Oct. 30.â From
this time forward Jeffries will
cut out heavy road-work and de
vote his time to. attaining .speed.
He will no longer punch. 'the
bag for. hours nor do other feats of
endurance, but will save his strength for
the night of battle. In future he will bcx
faster, take shorter sprints and <ft> other
work that will make him faster on his
feet and with his hands. He inaugurated
this system yesterday and as. a result he
was not fatigued at the close of his day's
work. The way he moved around the
gymnasium reminded one of Corbett or
some equally fast boxer. He started in
his day'B training. at 10 o'clock. For ten
minutes he rowed at the rate of thirty
strokes a minute, after which he donnec'
small cloves and had a seance the
bag. .The rat-a-tat sounded like distant
thunder. He .worked fast and perspired
freely. As a fitting 'finish: to this popu
lar form of exercise lie .rained heavy
left and right swings on the inflated rub
ber. Onlookers thought he would- burst
the bag with his tremendous blows, but
it withstood the walloping. After a few
minutes' rest Jeff skipped the rope.; He
pirouetted around ' the* gymnasium and
danced jigs, seldom interfering with the
whirling rope. He reeled off' 11S0 skips
without turning a hair and when he fin
ished informed his trainers that he was
perfectly satisfied with the condition of
his wind. He breathed freely and with
out effort. ';.; 'â¢ '"" \u25a0 '\u25a0\u25a0.â¢ i' \u25a0

He weighs.' ISO pounds ' and like his
elder brother has strength and endur

sent him by Jim. Jack would brace him
self and stiffen his body, but the force
would send, him back a trifle each time.
This work was continued for some time
and the champion stopped when he saw
that Jack was losing, buttons and felt
weary. The work Jeffries did up to
this time would -have tired '.an
ordinary man. but as Jim is out
of -the ordinary,* he picked up light
dumbbells and side-stepped and danced
around the gymnasium fighting -an
imaginary opponent. Once in a while
he would follow a feint with a swing
which would have annihilated an antag

the contest for the Cambridgeshire
Stakes, the principal event of the meet
ing. The result was a tremendous upset
for the betting men. W. C. Whitney's
Watershed, the winner of the' race, rid
den by Johnnie Reiff , was considered to
be a rank outsider and started at 25 to 1
against Lord Wolverton's Osboch, which
was second a* the finish, was the favorite
at 100 to 14 against. The betting on C. W.
Wood's Lascaris, third horse, was 10 to 1
against, Codoman, ridden by Maher was
greatly fancied in France, but did not
flatter his supporters. M. Ephrussi,
Codoman's owner*, is said to have backed
the horse to win $40,000." \u25a0 . â¢ â¢ \u25a0â¢ ;

over his experiences as a boiler-maker,

roughly, for Gus Is a terror on everything

has reconsidered his vow not to 'put on
the gloves again before the big fight. Next
Saturday night Gus will Journey down to
Redwood City, where he .jwill - box four
friendly rounds with Joe McAuliffe, who
is opening a gymnasium and boxing school
there. Joe has been having a hard trial

he works out in the gymnasium. Ruhlin
set an unusually fast clip there j yester

THE HAGUE, Oct. 3O.-The report of
the Deutsch Red Cross Society, just pub
lished, deals bitterly with the capture of
the Deutsch ambulance corps near Pre
toria July 5, 1900. It declares the British
knew- before the ambulance left Pretoria
that It carried private letters from Boer
families to men in the field, and that they
did not protest, but allowed the ambulance
to etart. captured It outside the town and
used the letters as a pretext for deporting
the doctors and nurses, who are still In
captivity on the island of Ceylon. The
Ked Cross committee subsequently per
sistently appealed to Lord Kitchener to
redeem his promise to Mrs. Botha and
allow the doctors and medicines to pass
through the British lines for the benefit
of the Boers, but no response was made
to the representations.

temporary and wholly independent of. . the

CHICAGO, Oct. 30.â Weakness In wheat
cables and continued reports of heavy rains
In Argentina Influenced wheat holders to sell
and encouraged short sellers. The cash busi
ness was also slow and both Northwestern
and. primary receipts were considerably In
creased. This brought an opening for Decem
ber M&VtC lower at 70%c. Only the gaining
strength in the corn pit prevented a decided
slump in wheat, for though in the face of these
bearish factors December sold up to 70%c later
when dullness was more pronounced It sagged
back quickly to 7H4c. The outside markets
were doing very little business and December
was the weaker future, ruling relatively %@V4c
lower than May. Late In the day, there was
a small reaction on export news and Decem
ber closed- weak, Uc lower, at 70%@70 l Ac.
Corn, was strong as the result of light re
ceipts and firm cables, which frightened the
short interest and Influenced buyers. Decem
ber closed firm, 1 /4Â®%c higher, at 57>ic.
December oats opened unchanged, fluctuated
narrowly and closed steady, %c higher.
Provisions were more active than at any
time for a week. There was an early small
demand which kept prices up despite a sagging
hog market. Later everything turned dull and
January pork closed unchanged, lard V-k higher.
The loading futures ranged as follows:
More Hay came In again, the receipts being
725 tons, including 33 cars. The market showed
no change whatever.
Cracked Corn and Corn Meal were lower
again, and Bran was - marked down a dollar.
Middlings were unchanged, but were weak in

CLOSING.
NEW TORK. Oct. 30.â The Commercial ' Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Forced liquidation has apparently ceased and
as a result the stock market had a more
cheerful tone to-day. Opinion is much" divided
as to whether the Bank of England will In
crease the minimum discount rate to-morrow.
Some say that.lt will be 3% per cent, others
that it will be unchanged. American stocks
are Improving and hopeful of an early set
tlement of Northern Pacific affairs. The close
was strons, with the coalers leading. â¢
London Market.
. At a meeting of the stockholders of the Pe
troleum Center Oil Company, on the 29th, the
following directors and officers were elected-
Henry Van Bergen, president; W. Ellery, vice
president; directorsâ Messrs. Hansen. Toplitz
and Baldwin. The company reports the offer of
$25,0CO for twenty acres of section 28-28-28 Well
No. 3 on 24-28-27 yields 100 barrels dally, and
well No. 4 has not been perforated yet. but
gives promise of being quite as productive as
No. 3. There is a balance of $4000 cash in the
treasury, after all expenses have been paid.
The only change on the Oil Exchange was an
advance in Junction to 24c, under sales of 1800
shares. Hanford showed some activity at $104@
103. The other stocks were quiet.
The feeling in local stocks continued firm in
the afternoon. Giant Powder advanced to
$85 50, Spring Valley Water to $87 50 and Gas
and Electric to $44 87%. Honokaa continued
strons, selling at $12 12%.
The Kern River Oil assessment of 50 cents
per share, levied October 26, becomes delin
quent on the Oil Exchange November 26, at the
office of the company, November 28, with sales
day December 17.
At a meeting of the Oahu Sugar Company
October 21, In Honolulu, the monthly dividend
was reduced from $1 per month to 50 cents. It
is said this action was taken on account of the
excessive cost of preparing for the new crop
and expenditures for labor. The stock is now
quoted at $120.
Although trading jras of moderate volume on
the morning session oi* the Bond Exchange, the
feeling was firm all along the line, and several
stocks advanced, owing to the fine condition
of the companies. Alaska Packers sold up to
$147 50, quite a sharp rise, and further advances
are reported not unlikely. It Is said that the
Pacific Packing* and Navigation Company,
which some months ago tried<to buy out all the
salmon concerns on the coast, and which did
succeed In getting most of them, with the prom
inent exception of Alaska Packers, is about to
reopen negotiations -with this company with
the view to purchase, and that it is prepared
to offer more Inducements than before. Again,
the company has had a very prosperous year.
An additional source of strength is the report
that the Insiders have been quietly buying up
stray lots of stock for some time. Under these
flattering conditions an advance in the stock is
only natural. . â¢
Another stock to advance under fine conditions
was Giant Powder, which sold up to $85. It
will be remembered that a couple of weeks ago
the stock advanced in consequence of a rise in
the price of powder in what is called the neu
tral zone, and now, another rise id contemplated
in other sections. These appreciations in pow
der naturally increase the Income of the com
pany and give the shares an upward turn.
California Wine was still another stock to
rise, selling up to $90. The selling desire on the
part of a director or two is said to be satis
fied, especially as the stock has been absorbed
as fast as offered.
The sugar stocks were steady to firm, and Ho
nokaa sold ud to $12.

1 rather obvious manipulation. The manipula
tion was for the advance, but its effect was
confined to the leading active stocks so far as
any notable results were concerned. The gen
eral list was slucgish and hesitating and fluc
tuated narrowly throughout. The coalers, were
taken in hand for an upward movement, the
concerted buying of the group being based on
the reports oÂ£ very heavy demand and a traffic
only limited by the car supply of the com
panies, while prices are firmly maintained at
the maximum of recent years. The high
priced members of the group gained from 2%
to 3 points and those selling under par rose
about a point. St. Paul resumed its recent
show of strength and was followed as usual
by the Pacific stocks to the extent of between
one and two points. There was another dem
onstration in the Vanderbilts also to-day, but
its influence did not extend very effectively
outside of that group. Amalgamated Copper
continued active and somewhat Irregular above
yesterday's level on unconfirmed rumors cir
culated of the possible incorporation of Calu
met and Hecla. Manhattan and Sugar helped
cut the show of strength. The determination
to take a cheerful view of the gold export
movement, which was increased to-day to a
total of $2,850,000, was apparently based on the
idea that the relief afforded to the foreign
situation will be reflected back upon this mar
ket. There is some assurance felt also that
the movement will be checked after to-morrow's
shipments. This feeling will be emphasised
if the Bank of England maintains its discount
rate unchanged to-morrow, as now seems pos
sible. Judging from the freedom with which
the bank discounted to-day at the current rate.
The favorable subscriptions announced yester
day for the New York City bonds are taken as
reassuring regarding money market conditions
and the release of November 1 disbursments,
including .Government interest. Is" looked to to
tide over next week. Some currency is return
ing from the 'West and the transfers to the
South have diminished. Receipts of gold from
the Pacific Coast through the sub-treasury
have served to lighten the drain of that in
stitution jipon the money market. With sur
plus reserves at a figure well above that of
last year and a year before anxiety over the
money market outlook tends to relax and the
sentiment is expressed that the gold shipment
can well be spared. After a very irregular
movement the market, closed firm in the neigh
borhood of the best prices.
Railroad bonds were only moderately active
and show irregular changes. Total sales, par
value. ?2,660,C00.
United States bonds were all unchanged on

Wall Street and Trade.
The New Tork circular of Henry Clews says:
â¢The stock market Just now presents the in
teresting though not unusual spectacle of mov
ing in conflict with natural conditions and
being entirely under the control of powerful
and able manipulation. The Investor of or
dinary prudence thinks that prices are still
at a high level, and that the slight reaction
from the boom of last spring, while it 'may
not Justify any bear movement, \u25a0 is certainly
not a bull argument. It should be borne in
mind, however, that the present situation is
a very unusual one and cannot be measured
by usual standards. There has been reaction
la certain sections and in certain industries
from causes too familiar to call for repetition;
on the other band there are sections of the
country and particular industries which are
JL^t feeling the full effect of the wave of pros
perity; so that while it may be receding at
some points it is still progressing at others,
causing a confusion of results out of which
It is not easy to form confident opinions.
"The chief indications of recession have been
in the smaller profits of the industrials, the
losses here and there in our export trade and
â¢:he damage to crops from drought. On the other
hand the leading Industries continue exceeding
ly active and old and new establishments are
running to their full capacity. The enormous
consumptive demand for products of all kinds
surpasses the expectations of the most experi
enced merchants and manufacturers and affords
the most striking testimony of the soundness
aind substantial chancier of the country's
growth. This is esi^-ially true of iron and
coal, the use of which is dependent upon the
activity of other lines of industry- There are
no signs of reaction in these markets, and it
Is evident that slight concessions in values
\u25a0"vould. brine out a new lot of orders that are
being held back for Just such a contingency.
The agricultural situation -is undoubtedly the
most unfavorable factor observable, but 'the
harm there 4s confined to spots and has many
offsets, so that the injury will be much less
than anticipated in July last. Farmers are
treneraJly prosperous and out of debt and well
tble to meet their losses. Briefly stated then
the agricultural, industrial and commercial sit.
nation, while not so brilliant as a year ago,
is sound and satisfactory, and In these direc
tions no very strong bear arguments can be
found."
Dried Fruit in New York
Mail reports xrom New Tork say: "Weak
ress in both raisins and prunes is marked and
tuyers are nervous and busing very gingerly
in the existing unsettled condition of the mar
ket. At the solicitation or coast holders some
offers at low prices are being wired out and
occasional sales are reported of seeded and
loose raisins under the prevailing association
figures. Three-crown loose Muscatels, new crop.
It Is reported, have eoÂ»d as low as 4e t. o. b.
coast, this being lie under the association price.
This cut. it Is believed, is due to a division
of commission by the broker.
"Loose raisins are Vic lower on the spot,
J -crown being freely quoted at 6c and selling
Jairly well In a small way for immediate needs,
"wo-crown, it Is understood, can be bought at
l\^c and 4-crown at 6Â«ic. Imported raisins are
tiuiet. Valenclas belnr slow and easy at 6%c
lor layers. Malaga London layers have some
tall at ?1 55.
"Prunes ere in fair request on spot, with
<iuite liberal supplies. Santa Claras 40-50s,
tire generally held around 7c, but new goods
10 arrive soon, are offering at 6%c. Santa
Claras, for shipment from California, are most
ly quoted on a 3c basis, but it is reported
<:an be bought at %c less. Oregon Italians are
dull at about a 2c basis.
'â¢Currants are steady* at 5%<8X%c f or â¢ Am-
Jilias. with fair demand. Cleaned are still sell
ing well from 7@"Uc for cartons and 6%c for
bulk ffoods.
'â¢Shelled almonds are more plentiful and in
irood demand. Brazil nuts are very strong at
MVic and Uhic. with tendency still toward
hlcher quotations."

â¢ General Buller, in the speech .which led

National Review to publish the full dis
patch and to explain how it was obtain
ed, declaring that be would then publish
a certified copy ot the original and allow
the public to judge the matter. The ed

that he got the dispatch from a civilian
who was in Ladysmith at the time and
who said there was nothing secret about
it. He asserts also that he understands
that both General Buller and General
White have officially asked permission to
publish the authorized version and that
he cannot conceive why permission has
been withheld. ,
The same informant/ giving an alleged
explanation of the fact that there was
no co-operation between General Buller
and General White during the battle at

the attack on December 15, to the dismay

SEATTLE, Oct. SO.â The battleship Ore
gon is now on the Government diydock
at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, where she
was taken last Friday to undergo repairs
to her keel, which was severely strained
when she struck on the rocks some
months ago. Later she will be given a
general overhauling and painting. More
than ordinary care was necessary on ac
count of the strained keel and foe many
days prior to the docking extraordinary
preparations were made for the reception
of the big war vessel.
In order that she might rest gently on
the blocks, instead of pumping all the
water from the dock, as is usually the
case,' only about six feet was taken out.
Shores were then placed in position and
two divers entered the water to adjust
wedges and blocks carefully about . the
keel, before any great part of the- weight
of the battleship was allowed to rest. The
remainder of the water has since been
pumped from the dock and the damaged
part of the hull exposed.

Interested in "forestry in this section, have

they axe confident, despite this setback,
that they will . eventually succeed.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 30.â A roaring furnace
seems to be the ultimate destination -of
"Reminiscences of Santa Clara County

sued by Amaury Mars. This action -was
proposed at a meeting of the Improve
ment club last night Santa Clara County,
through Its Supervisors, paid Mars $1000
for 500 copies of this literary rot, which
ridicules the citizens and criticizes the
county's industries and officials. It was to
have been circulated through France and
America in the hope of attracting' settlers.
So disgusted are the people with the
publication, which characterizes the men
of the county as "excellent dry nurses"
and pictures the women as donning gloves
to fry steaks and chops, that no copies
will be circulated.

Congress would go as far aÂ» possible In
passing laws for the suppression of an

In the event of the commission reporting fa
vorably as to the purchase of the Panama
canal, this would doubtless lead to further de
lay, but I am not apprehensive that anything
will be done with this project. The Nicaragua.
route is by far tne more desirable and I con
fidently expect to see definite action taken at
the coming session of Congress toward Its early
construction.
I am delighted with the apparently satisfac
tory negotiations between the two governments
on the Nicaragua canal matter and that it has
been practically agreed to abrogate the Clay
ton-Eulwer treaty. I am certainly In favor of
the construction of this canal, provided that It
be made an American canal in every sense of
the word and. under absolute control by the
American Government. I do not believe It nec
essary that we should fortify the canal, but it
Is prudent that we should acquire the right to
do so for our own protection, without the con
sent of any other Government

In the course of his conversation with
the commission M. Hutin has referred to
the old proposal that the United States
buy -a majority of the stock of the Pan
ama Canal Company, and also to the pro
posal made last spring under which, in
case of disasreement as to the value of
the property, in case of its sale outright
to the United State3, it shall be deter
mined by a board of appraisers. These
proposals this has already re
jected and will do so again.
The proposal of the Panama Company
has not changed the determination of
the Isthmian Canal Commission to recom
mend the Nicaragua route. Th 3 commis
sion will suggest a canal thirty-five feet
in depth over its shoalest part and 150
feet lii width at its narrowest point. It
will also urge eight locks.

made to the Isthmian Canal Commission,

swer from President Castro of Venezuela
to a resolution adopted by the Congress
expressing a hope that Venezuela and
Colombia would reach an equitable and
rational agreement of . their present dif
ficulties. President Castro says:
"I esteem your intervention as of an
entirely friendly nature, since these dif
ferences do not come within the purpose
of your union. The Venezuela Govern
ment, which is essentially republican,
liberal and democratic, joyfully corre
sponds with your friendly desires. Vene
zuela has not sought nor desired war

There are many here who connect her
departure for that seat of the asphalt

this condition the resignation of Secretary
Jesse Wcods was requested. Bert Woods,
a brother of the secretary, has also been
dismissed as instructor. Dissensions
arose in the cjub and friends of the Woods
brothers- had a special meeting called to
see if they could not be reinstated. For
a time it looked as though a secession of
members would follow,, but the statement
by President Louis Bond that the books
were badly muddled, and that Secretary
Woods had refused to obey the orders of
the directors in regard to keeping ac
counts and paving bills, bas quieted af
fairs. He said this was the reason
Woods had been requested to resign, and
that he had dismissed the instructor be
cause th<j receipts were not sufficient to
pay his salary. J. G. GrifBth of Santa
Clara has been elected secretary.

SALINAS, Oct. 30.â When the case of
the Commercial Bank of San Jose' vs. W.
B. Frue was called for trial this morning
Judge Dbrn announced that he would first
hear the case on the cross-complaint of
John H. Seuts, administrator of Frue's
estate, vs. M. Phillips and others. The
jury had been obtained and D. M." Delmas
made the opening statement, claiming
$20,000 damages for Frue. It was virtually
agreed that the ultimate Issue to be de
cided by the jury should be "Was there
fraud in the sale to Frue of Lagunitas
ranch, under the "misrepresentations of
Mitchell Phillips and F. W. Moore, and,
if so, how much was Frue damaged
thereby?"
Phillips was the first and only witness
examined to-day. He told how from his
earnings oh the Pacific Mail dock, and
from dealings in 'real estate, he had
bought land for $8000, the land which
ultimately became San Jose Chinatown.
This property he exchanged with J. R.
Hebbron for Lagunitas . ranch. In 1897,
hearing that W. B. Frue wanted a coun
try home, he sought an introduction
through Fred W. Moore of San Jose, and
later agreed with Moore [ and" ex-Mayor
Valentine Koch to pay them $1000 if
they could induce Frue to buy the ranch
for $25,000. He planned with them to in
vite Frue to his place on a fishing and
hunting expedition, though there were no
fish there and little game. " .
The witness said that Frue, Moore and
himself had drinks and a jolly good, time
at 5 the ranch. Frue agreed to buy the
land, and the next day, Phillips said, he
telephoned to his lawyers InSan Jose to
have the. papers ready. They were signed
by Frue without any examination of
them. '\u25a0'\u25a0-. ' : ~\ .'\u25a0

PORT TOWNSEND, Oct. 30.â The ves

E. K. Wood. Tugs returning this.morn
ing report the vessel on the middle of the
north side of the spit, and thus far she
has ' sustained no serious damage. Last
night four tugs made an unsuccessful ef
fort to haul her off. -Another effort was
to have been made this evening at high
tide, and If they failed to haul her into
deep water the vessel will undoubtedly be
a total loss, as to-night's tide will be one
of the highest of the season.

title the bank at San Jose had in Frue's
note for $17,000 and the mortgage was that
Phillips owed the bank 53000 and had as-
Blgned the papers as collateral security.
The witness was reluctant to give full
information as to his share in the trans
action, claiming that Aloore was acting
for him. He claimed he was unaware that
W. B. Frue was addicted to the use of
strong 1 liquors. ' .
The attention of the detectives Is being
turned toward securing the identity of
the prisoners. The police are satisfied
that at least four of the nine are profes
sional criminal*, and that a number of
discharged soldiers are Jn the lot. While
there is ample evidence already developed
against the mer to establish charges of
burglary, the . detectives arje desirous of
securing es complete records as possible
concerning their prisoners' antecedents
before beginning the prosecution.
The police have a quantity of clothing,
tools and weapons taken from the gang's
headquarters for which owners are
wanted. \u25a0 >

Not only has this crime been definitely
fixed on the gang, but members of the
Bendel household have identified one of
the nine, who went to the residence Mon
day afternoon ostensibly to sell goods.
His real purpose was to gain a view of
the premises preliminary to the burglary
that had been planned.

Hearing the crashing of tbe planking
Mrs. Hoag and Miss Steiner rushed to the
rescue. None of the children were to be
seen, the supposition being that they were
all in the well. A ladder which was top
short to reach the water was lowered by
the women and Miss Steiner went down.
She managed to get hold of the elder
child, but her strength deserted her. She
then came up and held the ladder while
the mother went down. Mrs. Hoag jumped
from the ladder. One child threw its
arms around her neck and held fast. The
other, Which was unconscious, had been
twice to the bottom. As it came to the
surface the second time the mother
caught it. In this condition she clung to

added to a sad career. Several months
ago the girl left her home in San Fran

here by which she would be able to earn
a living. Upon her arrival here she found
employment. For several months ,she
struggled along and by close living was
able to provide herself with clothing and
occasionally send a few dollars to her
mother and father at home. Finally,
growing discouraged, she started out to
seek what she had an idea were the pleas
ures of life. Later she was induced to en
ter a resort on Washington street con

as LUa Young. She went to the house on
Wednesday, October 23. She was a corpse

DEATH CLOSES TBAGEDY
OF A YOUNG GIRO'S LIFE
There is" a reward of $500 offered by the
State for the arrest and conviction of the
murderer.
The murder of Albert Anderson was
most atrocious. He had grown suspicious
of impending danger, and before leaving
Winters at 10:30 o'clock on that "Sunday
night had asked persons to accompany
him home, but they did not share Jits fears
and refused to go with him. He was way
laid and his head was beaten to a JTJlp
with some blunt instrument. His Jiody
was then thrown over an embankment
and dragged to a place of hiding in the
Putah Creek bottom. It was found the
next day by a boy who was -herding cat
tle. The pockets had been turned inside
out to indicate robbery as the motive for
the deed. Anderson was known to carry
but little money upon his person.
It was not known then that he had any
enemies, but recent events have brought
out some peculiar facts. One of the offi
cials says that there Is at least one woman
concerned in the case, and that should
Young be brought to trial startling evi
dence will be elicited. The officers feel
certain they have the right man under
suspicion this time. . ' .. J. . _
No direct evidence was found against
the man until about a week aso, when
Colonel Taylor went to a trash receptacle
near the cabin that had been occupied
by Young to get some old rags. In this
he found the right sleeve of a shirt, cov
ered with blood, and identified it as hav
ing belonged to Young. The laundry num
ber on the garment was positively identi
fied by a Sacramento firm as the mark
it had placed upon clothing sent to its
laundry by Young. As Anderson was car
ried nearly 'one hundred yards after his
head had been crushed in the murderer's
clothes must have had blood stains upon
them. ......
Young was a roommate of 'Anderson on
the farm of Colonel Samuel Taylor, near
Winters, for some time prior to the mur
der and the two men had frequent quar
rels. After the murder of Anderson
Young became restless, suspicious and
easily frightened. At one time he asked
permission to move his bed from the
cabin in which he had been sleeping to
the house, giving as a reason that he
was afraid some one would kill him.
Later he sent to Healdsburg for his rela
tives and had them go to Winters to re
side. They did not stay long and when
they left he went with them and remained
in Healdsburg until a few weeks ago,
leaving about the time the suspicion of
the officials was directed toward him. It
is said that he was summoned to appear
at the Coroner's Inquest in Winters, but
failed to do so.

Thousands upon thousands of seagulls
are living on the marshes back of Sau
salito. There are but few of the scaven
gers on the bay, and mariners have been
wondering what was the matter. The
recent high tides, in conjunction- with a
big run of small sardines, are responsible
for the disappearance. The tide carried
the fish up Into pools all over the marsh,
and not only left them there, but also
great quantities among the sea grass. On
these the gulls are feasting. The people
along the beach at Sausalijo also made a
haul, and men, women and children were
engaged all day carrying the fish away.
Seagulls Are Feasting.
The Andrew Hicks will be refitted and
will sail again for. the south in a month
or six weeks.
The Andrew Hicks, one of the last of
the old fleet of whalers, arrived from the
Okhotsk Sea yesterday after a successful
cruise. She was built thirty-five years
ago in Fairhaven,' Mass., but Is as sound
and stanch to-day as when she was
launched. She left here in February last
to hunt the sperm whale, and after a
visit to Hawaii, the Marshall group and
Guam, she was headed for the coast of
Japan. Several whales were taken and
the bone and oil shipped home. The vessel,
nevertheless, brings home 2000 pounds of
whalebone and 270 barrels of oil. On the
2Sth inst. she spoke a vessel supposed to
be the German bark H. F. Glade, bound
south. *" ' \u25a0â

Among the passengers was C. A. Wat

visit to the islands i in the Interest, of

noted violinist, and Madame Cole is a

Both artists will be heard here.
Smith volunteered an opinion that the
ruling of Thomas Ryan, First Assistant
Secretary of the Interior, adverse to the
proposed Kohala Mountain water fran
chise, was based wholly on the distinc
tion between a license as applied for and
a lease. A lease would have been within
the power of the Territorial Government
to grant, under the condition of a term
of twenty-one years and that of compe
tition at public auction for the privilege.
Atherton's visit to New York may be
in connection with the affairs of the Ha
waiian Automobile Company, a concern
in which he is heavily interested.
Another arrival on the Alameda was
F. M. Swanzy, managing director of the
old English house' of Theo. H. Davis
& Co., Limited, and acting British Vice
Consul in Honolulu.
Both Smith and Atherton positively de
nied that their trips had any thing, to do
with the development of water, arising
on public lands.
Joseph B. Atherton, head of the large
corporation of Castle & Cooke, Limited,
and president of many other Hawaiian
companies, -also arrived on the steamer
and goes to New York.
"When I am through with my business
in New York I may go to Washington,
incidentally. I. am not going away for
my health or for politics."
Among those who arrived on the Ala
meda was TV. O. -Smith, former Attorney
General of Hawaii, who goes to ' New
"iork on business. It was published In
Honolulu that he was going to oppose the
income-tax act of the late Hawaiian
Legislature at Washington, but to a re
porter he said:
The Alameda brought up a considerable
amount of cargo, fifty steerage passen
gers and the following named in the
cabin:
C. I>. Argus, J. B. Ailierton and wife, lime.

There was no sign of the overdue Amer
ican ship Benjamin F. Packard, now out
141 days from Norfolk, Va., for Honolulu,
and on which 15 per cent reinsurance is
being paid. The City of Peking, due to
day, may bring word of her. If she does
not the rate is sure to advance.
THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Alameda and the Pacific Mail
Company's City of Para arrived
from Honolulu yesterday. The
latter vessel has been carrying
Porto Ricans from Port Los Angeles to
the sugar plantations and has come home
for an overhauling. She brought up two
steerage passeneers and no cargo. % i
The Alameda was expected to make a
good run, but did not do any better than
before her engines were changed from
compound to triple expansion. The trou
ble "was due to the firemen. The vessel
took away a Japanese crew, and nearly
all of them turned out to be "green" in
stead of "seasoned" hands. They could
not keep steam in the boilers, and conse
quently the vessel fell behind time.
