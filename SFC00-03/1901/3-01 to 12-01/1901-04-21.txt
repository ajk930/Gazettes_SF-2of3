Â¦ These reforms were being planned and
rapidly put In force when the daring and
progressive Emperor was placed. In dur
ance by the Dowager's coup.
. What they were in" general has been
made known by Kang Yu "Wai, who was
then the Emperor's personal adviser and
confidant, and who has since done more
than any other one man for the rescue of
his imperial patron. ,
As to the details and methods, the fins
arts of law and statecraft by which such
tremendous reforms were to be accom
plished without derangement' of the old
settled ways. I am indebted to his,excel
lency. Count Okuma; .who was at, that
time Premier of Japan and was In | con
stant correspondence' with- the Emperor
Kwang Bu.. \ .'.
In a personal . conversation with that
great statesman ; he Informed m e o f t h a
full details of the plans, which > he had
suggested for i the reform of China, based
upon Japan's experience. , though, by ' rea
son of the benefit of it, an improvement on
the system. which In twenty years changed
that unknown, hermit empire of : the eeaA
girt Isles Into a wvrld powwr of the first
mdfnitude.
This may seem strange, for the Em
peror of a country to .be In council wl th
the of , another country with
which he had so lately been at war, but it
must be remembered that the war be
tween China and Japan was never a quar
rel that sprang from the heart of the Chi
nese people. Most of them had no feeling
in the matter; many of them never heard
of it. L , â¢
\ Russian diplomacy was at tha bottom of
the entire trouble, as It has been of all of
China's' Borrows. ;, . c ;

only hope" to preserve her from'dismem
berment and an age-long enslavementâ of
a race cut to pices and- parceled among
greedy powers, to be taxed * and ' drained
for their Â¦ financial gain.

"to i the Chinese Consulate, and under
an apprehension that he was intend

The facts were that he was but go
ing to assist the Emperor's party, and
to assist the Emperor, in whose name
the country is ruled, can be no of
fense. ;"-
He carried letterg to all of the
' great friends of reform in Chin a,, and

Singapore to Hongkong, Macao, Can

He was well received there and In
order to facilitate his work in reor
ganizing 1 the iinpsrial army was
given* a rank which, corresponds to
that of lieutenant general, together .
with practically the entire command
of all military operations in Kwang- !

General Lsa has now nearly thirty
thousand men ready for mobilization
in the province of Kwangtung, and
there are altogether in the different
'provinces nearly four hundred thou

rescue of their Emperor.
During the year of General Lea'i

the^ officers 'of the . Imperial Reform
party, among them the president,
Yung" Wing, of Macao, and many
others whom the brave young Cali

Why, then, is the Emperor confined,
China's commercial condition in chaos, her
army routed, and her social economy at a
â¢ tar.de till as regards advancement?
Becuiise It Is the will or Russia, and,
txntil China becomes possessed of an army
ef her own. on modern footing, the will of
Ru&Ela will be the supreme law of the
Wua as far as her sphere of influence ex
Â«erds.
The extension of a sphere of Influence Is
like the advance cf a mist It is Indefinite
hazy and uncertain, but It envelops and'
conceals everything within It, and Russia
Is extending this hazy form of boundary
line as fast as she can get railroad- ma
terial on the ground with which to do it.
The Emperor realize* that no power can
fight China's battles for her; that she
deeds no assistance, for she- has the men
*ad the money.
Tl> use these two things It Is but neces
sary that the governmental power, here
toforewscattered through bureaus and far-
The people of China proper, the true
Chinese. Including all south of the Yang-
Ue. and many of the people living north
jot that line, are unanimous In demanding'
"the aame things.
THE Emperor of China Is held a pris
oner by the self-constituted Empress
Dowascr.
The reason that she confines him
is that he desires to put in force
those very reforms of which the nations of
Europe and the United States are In favor.
TTOMER LEA, a Stanford
JlJL student with military incli
nations and a descendant of
a collateral branch of the Lee fam
ily which gave the South its great
general, left here shortly after the
Emperor of China zvas imprisoned
by the usurping Dowager. Lea
went to China and offered his ser
vices to raise an army and restore
the Emperor.
His offer zvas accepted. He zvas
made a lieutenant genera!, placed in
charge of affairs in the southern
provinces, which include Kwang
tung, and has now thirty thousand
armed men in thct province alone.
He passed through here on a Hying
visit to Washington and London,
whence he zvill return to China.
Lea has seen a chance to do 'in
China what Gordon attempted to
do. If he succeeds it will be history.
If he fails .
If. on the contrary, the Chinese courts
were to adopt . tha Western cod* of pro
cedure and the punishments of criminals
reduced to those which modern humanity
tolerates, there would no longer be a ne
cessity, for.' such, courts of exterritorial
jurisdiction and one more bone of conten
tion would be removed.-
â¢ It. would take, but little to reform the
code of . criminal trials and . punishments.
As far as I can see the people are with
out exception - strongly against them and
are revolted by the . cruelties practiced.
Humanity and kindness are Chinese vir
tues not only in theory, but everywhere
exhibited In dally life- Tha Emperor
Kwang Su Is as gentle and peaceable In his
instincts as hi3 .Tartar forefathers were
fierce and cruel, i Again such was the iso
lation of the Emperor from' his people un
der the old regime that It Is possible that
he never even heard of the tortures in-
courts. !n which one Chines* and Â«â¢ for
eign Judgre sit In bank in Judgment Â«rf all
cases where & foreigner's rights *r ITbâ
erties are- concerned. This Is In itself a
pain to the people, but what Is far worse
and more subversive of all Integrity of the
Government Is the. exterritoriai Jurlsdio
tloh of the court, -which Is. a constant
cause of friction between the people and
the Judiciary. A Chinese, apprehended
by the native- authorities for crime, has
but to claim that hÂ« Is a Bervant of a for
eigner and engaged in his service at the
time, whereupon the Assessor's Court
claims his case, and as all courts are fond
of ' extending j and enlarging their Juris
diction, .there- Is never a final settlement
or, adjudication-, to. say how far Its
powers go.

Cotillon favors that are sometimes of
great Intrinsic value create much rivalry,
which is bitter if eilent, and pain and hu
miliation are caused that do not pass with
the. evening's dance. .
The pretty girl, the clever girl, ! has little
Ehow with the rich girl who entertains, or
the. young woman who ia a particular pet
of the hostess, and social ..and monetary
power Is the open sesame to belleshlp. -
No national convention contains more
politics and wirepulling than is indulged
In during a fashionable - cotillon. It is
always a little drama of human nature,
with selfishness, ambition.. diplomacy, in
trigue and jealousies, with high hopes and
corresponding heartaches. The day when
personal attraction made the' belle o{ the
ball Is gone," and. the polite little game of
beggar my social' neighbor Is so complex
in its workings that Ujere is small chance
for any but those who are in position to
bestow social favors. â¢ . -\ "
Politics and Jealousies.
Fancy a writer of early date describ
ing the cotillon In a series of "articles
edited by the Duke of Beaufort. K. G., as
"properly speaking, more a game than a
dance, more suitable for children than for
grown men and women. It certainly is
not a British pastime. : There is something
absurd in the thought of an Englishman
clad in his full armor of -evening dress
and starched linen, going j down . on hla
knees before a lady and gravely wiping
out his own image from a looking glass."
"The cotillon is a French dance," Is the
writer's crisp parting mot.
A quarter of a century past a young
man engaged the company of a young wa â¢
man a fortnight ahead and presented her
with a nosegay on the night of tho cotil
lon, which consisted of Intricate flgures
and trifling favors. Nowadays th"e cotil
lon in New York has all the magnificence
of a court ball, with dazzling display In
decorations, supper, favor3 and m all the
appointments. â¢ â¢' .
Sixty years ago the cotillon was intro
duced Into New York, but it really meant
all the sauare dances. Then the "iJanci
ers" came in, and in order to distinguish
the cotillon it was called the german, un
til a very short time ago, when, the
square dances having become unfashion
able, the old French name camÂ© back.

"The epitome of private dancing" an
old dancing master calb it; the Ideal way
to sociability, the very last sort of gay
ety a bachelor gives up, the first to which
a debutante looks eagerlv forward. It is
the most diverting, most exhilarating and
most popular form of entertainment in
metropolitan society, and the whole coun
try follows.
There is the additional, advantage in
dancing the cotillon of giving to a larger
number a chance to dance^ln comfort.
The usual dinner dance or ball ends with
the cotillonâ the older euests first, tho
young married set and the dtfbutanled
taking possession cf the floor after mid
night. The day is long past when social
debts are liquidated bv an invitation to a
Jam and crush and a cud of tea, or to an
evening party. With another crush Â¦ that
makes dancing impossible and the young
man or woman who stands on the credit
side of the account is lucky to be asked
to one of the . cotiiloas given by a
hostess of the smart set. Nothing Is
spared to make It- as splendid as labor
and money and Yankee ingenuity c*n
achieve.
Ion such a good opportunity to show beau
tiful Interiors to their rriends that they
prefer, of course, their cwn houaes whe:i
It is possible.
FASHION "s content with the cotf'
lon, and its reij:n this season is
supreme. Smart and brilliant be
yond description, the cotillon In,
New Tork is the happiest form of
entertainment that society has undertak
en, and is always welcomed by men and
women who are bor^d with the usual
monoionous round of jneater formality.
Every now and then tome one tries to
eclipse the cotillon, offering a passing fad
or something more up to date In a fro'le
for the ultra fashionable, but New York
Is conventional in habit and nothing ever
really eoes as a substitute. Nothing elsa
offers such simple ani attractive oppor
tunities for the payment of social debts,
and furnishes at the fame time so much
diversion for every one. excepting only
the poor leader, who must be satisfied
with glory as his compensation.
There have been, changes and adapta
tions with the times, always reducing the
element of personal effort and Increasing
the expense, and nothing is In the lorg
run so popular as the cotillon, which is
given season after season with the samo
popular leaders, as long as they will serve,
and always with trappings of increasing
magnificence.
A dinner can be successfully given to
but a small number, a ball , Is too slow,
and only the very large houses have ball
rooms that will accommodate at one time
all the people a woman of the fashionable
eet must ask. There la always Sherry's,
or tlie Waldorf, or Dolmonlco's, but the

Though comfortable fortunes are spent

more I in â¢ some instancesâ a few I hundred
dollars can be made to cover the cost of
a cotillonâ if you are not In the smartest
of the smart set-and the affair will be
pretty and provide great fun. It is quite
possible to include enough flowers ot the
less - expensive kinds, with â¢ a , liberal use
of palms, -to decorate a room charmingly,
and in the small dancing clubs this is a
particular advantage, for the cost to each,
member is trifling. - - *
Â¦ r y Flowers are not always used lavishly,
even by those who can best afford it. Mrs.
John Jacob Astor loves bouquets of roses,
and : places them in just such /a manner
that their beauty is seen to best advan
tage.-. Mrs. Astor,' to be sure, sometimes
makes her ballroom look like a real rose
garden, ' and makes . brilliant j spots with
glowing azaleas and other, flowers of bril
liant color, but I have seen charming, ef
fects in some less favored drawing rooms
at comparatively trifling cost.* ' ' ,

Favors and Flowers.
A cotillon leader â¢ must be a drawing
room hero, who' is of necessity, past mast
er in generalship, In tact, quickness of wit,
good nature and self-control.: Even then
he- Isn't half . appreciated except by the
man who fails heir. to his. laurels and .tried
to live up to them. It is possible for the
dancers to make his lines easy.. or hard by
attention to his signals and directions and
by entering into the spirit of his plans.
The relations are something like those
of general and soldiers, and long associa
tion* is a decided gain in" enjoyment to
each. In New York 'the smart cotillons
are led by the more or less "old guard,"
which is composed of men who for many
seasons have been i in- great demand-

Bon led the "Cinderella" I dances this sea

.These - favorite leaders go on and on,
racking their brains for new ideas, keep
ing in mind the people to whom they are
indebted, in which they share a duty with'
the other menâ trying to make everybody
happy, and usually succeeding. Mr. 3Dyer
has a record of three cotillons in a week,
and though Mr. Hadden finds 'it hard to
lead as often as he Is demanded, with all
the philanthropic work he does for .love
of it, society still pursues him and, Insists
that he "lead on." .
Society's Favorite Leader.
Professor T. George Dodworth, whose
uncle, Allen Dodworth, taught dancing
and deportment to the children of fashion
able families in New Ycrk sixty years ago,
compiled a !ist of 250 cotillon figures, and
many of the best society leaders have
come from hi3 school or have ha4 private
coaching and .noirits from him. â¢
The "screen figure," with a woman be
hind each screen, over which she showed
a fan, has been a 'verysllvertinK one, but
society ffoes back with enthusiasm to the
"grand change," the basket and all the
jolly flgures of the dancing of early school
days. . . -
At Mr. Whitney's housewarmins. which
was one of the superb entertainments of
this season, the cotillon introduced several
figures that made" the evening One of the
jolliest of the winter. Men rode in on hob
by horses, ethers in balloons of colored

Speaking of cotillon leading, Mr. Hadden
says: "I find most-success in the'slmplest
figures,- for people do not like to be both

days that no one wants to make hard
work of play. I never "know- what the
figures are to be until I know who are the

The favors at a cotillon often Include
costly triukets in gold and silver, fans,
lorgnette chains, splendid bouquets and
an amazing variety of lovely things. Oolf
and polo, hunting and yachting supply
designs for many of the prettiest favors
and add. a' picturesque touch.
The charm of the cotillon does not pass
with the season in town, but all through
the spring and summer it will be danced
wherever society is. At Aiken, Palm
Bench, at Lakewood, Atlantic City, at the
country clubs and country houses, at the
cpeninjr of the season at tho "White Sul
phur Springs and kindred resorts â in
B'nort, wherever society gathers the cotil
lon is in full swing until the heat of sum
mer at Newport,- Lenox or Bar Harbor
forbids it. Morning germans were the
"agony" at AVhit<* Sulphur a few years
ago. but the athletic notion fills the head
of the girl of to-day and the cotillon does
only for variety.
In addition to the flgures designed by
Professor Marwig; some of the more fa
miliar ones used b7 Mr. Dodworth have
been very popular.- The military figure ia
as -follows: Bight couples dance, and at a
Bignal each selects another partner and
they form, a double' line in the middle of
the room, all . facing one way. The lines
part in fours, gentlemen and ladles locking
arms: then each section swings out/ the
first lady and gentleman of each section

Sere Are Some Cotillon Figures.
Half a dozen steps were once used In the
cotillon â the waltz, schottische, polka,
mazourka, redowa â but . the waltz -and
two-step are the only dances *of to-day.
Professor Carl llarwig, who taught the
belles of a generation past to dance the
cotillon and later took their children In
band, is fertile in original ideas for fig
ures, which he designs to suit the season,
place and company.

Character in decorations is the great
thing whether you expend much or little,

As -to the- other ' reforms the Emperor
has planned. It is hard to say which are
the most imnortant. Almost any one of
them will open the way for and assist the
others. Carried out simultaneously, they
would operate to gradually put the coun
try on a footing of prosperity and raise
the neople from the abject poverty In
which they have beqn sunk for genera
tions, although industrious and deserving.
The pictures which illustrate this article
show well enough the necessity for some
of the reforms. Â¦
Not so anparent Is the reason why the
examination system should be changed,
until it is known that there are 11,000 of
the little boxlike houses, similar to those
shown In the photograph of the examina
tion grounds in Canton.
These little buildings are each about
four feet by five feet and- seven high.
There is absolutely nothing within them
but "two boards â¢ placed across from wall
to wall.' one at the proper height for a
seat and the other In front of If to serve
as a desk.
When the examinations are â¢ to take
place the 11,000 students fllÂ» Into the
grounds and are distributed in the houses,
each one of which bears a number. Every
student carries his writing materials and
sufficient food to last him for three days.
After Â¦ they have gone into their little
boxes thev are not permitted to leave
them. Sentries pace In all of the alleys
for the purpose of keeping watch. After
spending three/days in these cramped
places, . with no chance to sleep or rest,
they are then dismissed for three days,
after , which they return for the second
examination of three Â¦ days, . then three
days', rest again, after which Â¦ comes the
final examination of three more days. -

The general, having received hia dimin
ished appropriation, takes out another lib
eral squeeze as a recompense to his'feel
ings and divides the balance of the money
among the regimental commanders, who,
knowing that the general, having put his
neck in the noose, dare not spring the
trap, again raid the army chests and turn
over to the â¢ company : captains a pitifully
small sum each to pay the men under
them.
The final result Is,- as I have been told,
in nearly every Instance where I have in
quired of the rank and file, that they do
not receive t on the average more than $2
each per month. Out of this sum they are
required to maintain their own mess and
pay all living expenses except transporta
tion, uniforms and equipment.
In many cases, the superior officers, not
content with squeezing the . pay of the
soldiers actually employed, resort to
another device to cten). Instead of re
cruiting the entire number of men re
quired, they wiir maintain a garrison of
only half the number, and when a re
view Is ordered, coolies from the neigh
boring villages arehlred at 10 cents per
day to carry guns , and wear uniforms. I
have again and again sailed up the river
from Canton without seeing a single sol
dier on garrison duty at any of the Bogue
stone forts which line the banks, but let
it be known that the Viceroy is to make
a progress of inspection, and immediately
the forts are filled with men, bearing their
guns and banners awkwardly, and wear
ing their uniforms with that sense, of
novelty which shows to the most inex
perienced- that they weie; not even raw
recruits. But everything goes without
question under the old regime. ; It
was the way of olden times, they say, but
the ways I fear have been much .corrupt

In regard to the reform of the literary ex
aminations for official promotion. It was
untruly said by those who desired to In
jure him, and innocently repeated by those
who knew no better, that he would by one
edict abolish the entire course of exam
ination in classical literature as a means
of qualifying for public office. This was
untrue and unjust, yet was taken as the
truth by many who .were friends of the
Emjtror's reforms.
The disturbance raised, by this state
ment can be imagined when you remem
ber that there were then nearly 3,000,000
students in China who had spent lengths
of time varying from one to seven years
In preparing for a classical examination,
ana a suauen abolition of the prize for
which they had been striving would have
been an Injustice.
Â¦ The intention of Kwang Su was far from
this.- It was to continue the examinations
as before, but to add by degrees to the
course of studies each year a little more
of modern science, and to eliminate, bit
by bit, the less useful parts of the class
ical course, following the methods of the
American universities, jsvhere, without any
â¢revolutionary methods,- they are substi
tuting practical mechanics for dead lan
guage classics.
.In regard to railroad extension in China
he was, of course enthusiastic and pre
dicted that the opposition of the people to
the roads would cease when the period of
construction Â¦ was over." That while - the
roads were being graded they could see
only a senseless tearing- up of farms and
cemeteries, but that' as soon as the con
veniences of transportation were afforded
them they would be as enthusiastic advo
cates of the extensions of the system as
are now the people of Japan, -who bid
eagerly, town against town, to secure the
passage of a projected road through their
districts. -
The imperial Chinese army has hereto
fore been, under the immediate charge of
the viceroys of the separate provinces.
Each of them has been required to fur
nish a certain quota of men. The con
scription and . maintenance of these has
been in turn farmed out by. the viceroy in
the same manner as were < the taxes. A
general would be given, for a considera
tion, the power to levy say 25,000 men. The
pay of these men, amounting to $5 per
month each, Mexican (about $2 50 gold), is
paid to the general; that is. It is supposed
to be paid to him, but, as a fact, the vice
regal treasurer would ' find many legal
technicalities in the way of paying the
money, on account, of- red tape on the
vouchers, unless he .were allowed to take
out. a liberal squeeze after the manner at

apprehension among the literati in China
ss to what were the Emperor's Intentions
flicted. That is why the Emperor is so
desirous of being allowed to mix with tne
populace and to have their expressions
freely published in the newspapers.
In this, as in all of the other reforms,
the mandarin class saw an' infringement
of their prerogatives, which allow them to
use the tortures of the law for enforcing
the "squeeze," by which they wring the
hard-earned money of the poor to add to
their hordes of wealth- It was this reform
of the criminal code more than anything
else which set the ruling classes against
the imperial reformers and has since kept
them poisoning the minds of the people as
to the sincerity of their intentions.

renk next in importance. It was not In
tended by the tmperor that any sudden
change should be made, by which the
study of the classics should be swept
away, but rather that to such part of
them as could be profitably studied there
should be added those useful sciences and
moaern arts which are necessary to a
comprehension of recent inventions. This
would be doing no more than following the
evolution of society itself, which demands
of all its members that they should know
how to operate the contrivances which
have been invented for Â«ts welfare and
comfort. The necessity for these schools
is shown by the fact that at the present
time nearly all of the viceroys and many
of the mandarins have sons or members
of their families studying in .the universi
ties of America. Notable among these
arc the Princes Sung, grandsons of Li
Hung Chang, who are now at Vanderbilt
University. Japan has provided her own
colleges of Western learning with such
far-famed names as Lafcadio Hearn and
Sir Edwin Arnold among their faculties.

*hen there were explained to the Empe
ror all of the worst things to be feared
from their unlicensed publications, he
said: "There can be no harm in the
truth; let every newspaper seek to find all
of the truth and publish it all. While they
publish the truth they shall be free from
all hindrance In . my empire. It is only
through a free press that the voice of the
people may be heard, and it is my first â¢

Cl&y and Kearny streets, the "Gaieties"
which had been established some time on
Jyor.p wharf by Kownia Grantee and &

Metropolitan, which was known as "The
Athenaeum."
Tucker's Academy of Music, which
opened February IB at the northwest cor

was devoted to concerts, lectures, pano

â¢while "Minstrel Hall," under Billy Birch's

packed at S o'clock and a prepossessing
young man at the door had taken In
about $800 when he passed through the
theater to the stage, gave the leader of
the orchestra orders to play until he got
the signal for the first tableau and softly
vanished out of the back door. About
this time the audience began to notice
that there had been no visible prepara

propositions to investigate. It need not
be said that the swindler had faded from
view, or that there was an exhibition of
grand and lofty profanity by the audi

about this time. It was located on Post
street, Just above Kearny, and was a
well-appointed hall, fitted with a stage
pnd scenery, which were made use of by
dramatic and operatic amateurs for years
after its formal opening in the summer of
ISO.!
The city was now Browing In all direc
tions so rapidly that a need for more the
aters seems to have asserted Itself, and,
after the usual amount of preliminary
talk nnd. preparation, work was begun on
tho Kureka, which was completed with
dispatch and opened under the manage,
ment of W, H. Letshton on I>ecember J8,
1862. The Eureka was located on Mont*
gomery street, between Fine and Califor
nia, where It now stands, having been
used fta a, itoek exchange for yean. It
was devoted ' to burlesque for several
weeks before Julia Denn tfayno began an
engagement In high class drama,
It was In this thattler In February, '63.
lint Halite Hinekley, then a beautiful
young actress, made her first Appear
ance in the part of Sarah In "Night and
Morning." This lady Is still a resident of
San Francisco, where she retired to prt*
vat? life many years ago after having en*
joyed a. long reign as a footllght favor-
The same year witnessed the opening of
the largest hall for public entertainment
yet built In the progressive city. Penn

12, on April 30. 18*5. Inaugurated Union
Hall on the south Fide of Howard street,
a short distance from Third.
Owing to its great size and Its distance
from theÂ«center of business it was soma
time before Union Hall became a popular
temple of amusement, although for year*
great throngs of people gathered within
'its walls on memorable occasions. Its de
struction by lire some time after Manager
Walter Morosco moved from it to th-Â»
Grand Opera-house la still fresh in tho
memory of the San Francisco public.
The opera companies which renewed in -

long vacation were piloted, as It were. By
the Estrella family, who presented a
Spanish dramatic operatic and ballet
company at Tucker' Â¦ Academy, without
making much of a. sensation in society,
but the real thine commenced when MmÂ».
Blacncclantt, Lizzie Parker and 8chweg
erle opened with "l.a Bonnajnbula" at th>
Metropolitan for a short season. Than
came the TManchta, who had been to Aus
tralia, and with them MmÂ©. Herrman,
Signers Enrico Gross! and John Ores?,
who opened At the Metropolitan May i.'i.
'&. StÂ«viTiil short seasons were played,
during one of which Hurry Courtntua
nanpr FJÂ»Â»ro In "The H*rb#r of Seville."
Grand opera also Alternated for a tinvt
with minstrels At the opera-home, and
many notable performances were gtvon
by each company.
On one oceaalon Manager Marulre took
a benefit, the. pefornmnce being mixed
Italian opera And negro comedy, whlc*i
was so successful that two more night?
were devoted to the imnn mixture, and
still the. opera survived and kept right o.i.
a season having opened at tha American
in January. 1863.
Occasional performances were also glv
en at the Metropolitan and, reinforco
ments having arrived from South Amer
ica, the management inaugurated tha
custom of giving operas for matinee per
lormances.
During this period of operatic excite
ment, while there were many accession*
and secessions advertised from time tn
time the management found frequent oc
casion to utilize the local talent hereto
fore mentioned, and the names of Jacob
Stadfeldt. then a fine barytone singer, and
lions. Charles, an excellent tenor, ap
peared frequently. Both gentlemen arÂ©
still in the city, Mr. Stadfeldt having held
a tine position in the Mint for many
years, while the latter, as M. Charle*
Morel, is teaching the French language In
Oakland schools.
The first Turners had their hall for ex
ercise in the old brewery on the corner of
Washington and Stockton, and when their
new hall was built where California Hall
now stands it was frequently utilized for
grand concerts. The Mechanics' Pavilion,
which then stood on the northwest corner
of Post and Stockton, was another com
modious and convenient place for larga
gatherings.
Notable arrivals of the -period here cov
ered were the Orrin family, Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Dillon, the first troupe of native
dancers from Hawaii, the Hanlons, J. H.
Taylor, the well-known tragedian; Ed
ward Hermann, th* magician, the Mas
sartls, Signer Parudi, Fanny Morgan.
Adah Isaacs Menken and Frank Lawler.
About the last Important managerial
enterprise with which Mr. Lawler waa
connected was In company Â¦with Barton
Hill and General Barton at the old Cali
fornia Theater in the late- seventies. Mr.
Lawler. who had been an actor-manager
for many years and at one time was a
great favorite in the Eastern States, de
veloped peculiar mental weakness soot
after his unsuccessful venture herÂ© and
the theatrical world was surprised to
learn that upon his own earnest solicita
tion he had been, admitted . to the Edwin
Forrest Home tor Actors, where, after a
few years of melancholy inactivity, ho
died. General Barton went to New YorK
and with Robert Miles, thÂ© veteran Cin
cinnati manager and old-time equestrian
actor, assumed management of the BJJou
Theater In New York, where Henry
Dlxey made hi3 great run in Adonis. Bar-'
ton Hill, still a hale and hearty old actor,
was lf^st seen herÂ© professionally as a
member of Nance O'Neill's company. Ha
was manager of the old California in its
palmiest days, under the proprietorship
of John McCullough and Lawrence Bar
rett, and his extremely honorable connec
tion with the theatrical history "of Cali
fornia is too well known to need mora
than a passing mention at this time*
The year 1864 was an eventful and In
teresting one to the citizens of San Fran
cisco. It â¢ marked the beginning of a :
period of great activity in theatricals an<i
astonishing enterprise in many other lines
of business. The great development of
the mining interests kept the city busy
taking care. of the pilgrims who flocked
to this coast, and speculators found a
productive field for amusement enter

TgZS EORGE HORTON, author of
{J "Like Another Helen" was
born in Fairvillc, Wayne County,
N. Y;, in the year 1859. .While
he ivas a small boy his parents emi
grated to Michigan, ivhere his fath
er bought a farm. Young Horton
zvas educated at the distrkr school
and the Marshall high school^ Then
he was sent to Ann Arbor, where
he graduated at the high school, and
afterzvard at the University of
Michigan in the classical contse.
MrrHorton zvas given a separate
diploma for especial excellence in
Greek and Latin.] A fter graduat
ing. he taiight school for awiiilc and
then entered upon newspaper work
With such a picturesque period of time
and place, such forcefully penned charac
ters and such a rapid flow of dramatic
events, It Is not to be wondered at that
there are no dry pages in Mr. Payson's
book. But more than this, the author,
with consummate skill, holds the real cli
max for the very end, and it will be a cold
reader Indeed who does not thrill with
breathless interest over ftiese last few
pages. Vytal's terrible fight with Imag
inary foes over the body of his loved one
There is one other character which must
not be passed without mention, and that
is Gyll Croyden, an alluring siren of the
stage, whb, even in the fastnesses of 'the
forests, wears her gorgeous theatrical
gowns and lightens the days with her
care-free songs. - .
In the first few pages Vytal,x_by most
brilliantly described sword play, saves
Eleanor from the clutches of this man,
who is to be his lifelong foe. After the
opening . chapters, with this as a climax,
the scene shifts to the English ships, with
all sails set for the new colony, and by a
coincidence all the leading characters are,
for one reason or another, found making
their -way over the broad ocean to the
promised land beyond. There is many a
stirring adventure before these pilgrims
eventually find their new home, but' these
escapes are mere play to the trying events
which develop in this strange land of
their own seeking, and which is to prove
the grave of so many of these English
pioneers. "
This little literary ruse has been fre
quently used in varying form, but it Is
still ever new and a success. There is one
other besides Vytal who loves Eleanor,
but this one would win her for himself
despite the impediment of the marital
bonds. He Is the arch villain of the book
âabsolutely unprincipled and yet with a
dash of courage, pertinacity and grit in
his make-up that made him a foeman
worthy, in every sense of the word, of the
steel of such a hero as Vytai.
The heroine Is Eleanor Dare, daughter
of the future Governor of the new colony
founded by Sir Walter Raleigh, a young
woman for â¢whom Vytal develops a pure
and all-sacrificing love. She unfortunate
ly brings on her head the wrath of Queen
Elizabeth, and to save her father is
obliged to marry against her will a harm
less but drunken and entirely repellant in
dividual. . '
The leading character, John Vytal, is an
English Cyrano de Bergeracâ lean of body
and visage but with a heart of gold and
a sword arm of steel. He has few friends,
and of these there is not one but'would
die to serve him. He has many enemies,
and of these many would die to slay him.
Of his friends there is one, a slow-witted
but true-as-steel Saxon giant, and an
other, a man "fat, as if, like a stage.buf
foon, he had stuffed a pillow in his dou
blet." Vytal and these two are sugges
tive of the three guardsmen, made so
famous by Dumas, and their feats of war
are certainly as marvelous. A fourth
friend is Christopher Marlowe, the poet,
whb plays a strong second to the hero in
his adventures in England and later in the
colony. The author explains in a foot
note: "As there is absolutely no reliable
record of Marlowe's personal life and
dwelling place at this time, I have felt
justified in attributing his generally ac
knowledged absence from London ' to a
Virginia voyagel"
in h!s foreword, the historical part is
largely contained In this same explana
tory preface, which calls the reader's at
tention to that romantic period of history
when the first colonists of America on
Roanoke Island" were neglected, aban
doned by their own countrymen and were
finally adopted into a .tribe of Hatteras
Indians. Mr. Payson has retained a few
historical persons in his pages, but there
is no painful following of exact history
nor detailed accounts of manners and cus
toms. He has chosen -this place and time
simply because it is "mystical and myste
rious and paramountly inspires romance,"
and not because he wishes his book to be
added as a supplementary on the reading
course of a history class. . â¢
As a well conceived, well written, inter
esting story and as a tale wherein you
will find many friends worth adding to
your list, of striking personalities in fic
tion, the book stands high on the list.
T? N his story "Active Service." publish
ed in 1899, Stephen Crane gave us a
]} romance which contained some strik
ing pen pictures of the fighting be
tween the Turks and Greeks. Mr.
Crane's story showed the possibilities of
a now end great field, but all in rather a
crude and unsatisfactory way. It served
its purpose of entertainment, however,
and dou'oi'ess awakened the interest of
many a reader in a period so replete with
romance and yet so seldom made a sub
ject bv novel writers.
Probably the reason for the nesiect by
American writers of so fruitful an epi
sode as the Mohammedan massacre of
four y<=ars ago is that they were all busy
with different subjects and In different
places at that time. A man cannot write
nbout f.omethins: that he has never seen
and about which he has heard little.
Undoubtedly the best man to deal -with
s^ich a rufcjrct is that man who has just
written "Like Another Helen." George
Honon was for five years United States
Consul in Athens; for that matter, he has
spent the better part of his life on stud
ies and in practical experiences which
should make him a first authority on Gre
cian history and customs.
Fcr all a man's learning and experience,
it does not always follow that he can
write a historical novel that will hold the
reader's attention. In fact, novels from
such sources are generally fiat failures,
but here is a most striking exception.
Mr. Horton writes as graphically and
powerfully of war as Stephen Crane did
at h-Is best. His historical facts are all
there, but they are put in as a rich set
ting for his characters and in no part of
his work is plot or person subordinated
to descriptions whose only object would
be to show the author's Intimate knowl
edge of his subject.
There are half a dozen characters
Â¦worthy of consideration in "Like Another
Helen." The only one the reader will find
any fault with is the American, John Cur
tis. And for Curtis we can hardly blame
Mr. Horton. As a matter of national pride
we may feel sorry that he has to be an
American, and yet we must admit that he
Is true lo life. Curtis is a hero In a wayâ
but in this case his way is that of a very
cautious Yankee.
1 he Ptory opens with a vessel loaded
with arms on its way from Athens to
Crete.. On board her are three prominent
figures of the book. One is a Cretan stu
dent, who Is going home to fight for lib
erty, the second is John Curtis, an Amer
ican college graduate and the son of the
owner of a Massachusetts shoe factory,
and the third is Lieutenant Lindbohm, a
soldier of the world and ever a partisan
of the weaker side.
The caique is sunk by a British gunboat
and these gentlemen finally manage to get
sshcre by swimr>lng. The young Cretan
acts as their guMÂ« and pilots them to a
little village high up in the mountains of
Crete. There they meet for the first time
this modern Helen for whom this peaceful
little hamlet is afterward destroyed. Xo
wonder that Curtfs loses his heart at once
âfrankly and openlyâ while the lieuten
ant also falls in love, but keeps his secret
to himself.
She arpeared to be standing on the top
or. a wall. She was floating in sunlight
she was glorified. Tali, straight, deep-bo
eomed, Fhe wore a skirt of blue homespun
and a short jacket of the same material, with
sleeves that were white from the elbows
down. Her hair, that was in reality a soft
brown, f*emed of gold; one massive strand
fell over her bosom quite to her knees. *Her
face was oval, the features as clearly cut as
those of a. poddees. Her large brown eyes,
â¢wide apart beneath a low, broad forehead!
beamed with fearless innocence and wonder.
On her left shoulder rested a huge earthen
water Jug. two-handled, bulging near the toil
and dwindling at each end. Her right hand
held this in place, and her left rested on her
blp.
This Is Panayota, the daughter of the
village priest.
There is another lever, however, who
eoon appears on the p cene: one that brings
death in his wake for many a brave Cre
tan peasant. This one is Kostakes Effen
Â£1, the Turkish commandant of the dis
trict, who has sworn that Panayota shall
become a member of his harem. In fact
he, will do more than that for her, he will
make her his wife and if need be renounce
his own religion for her.
Panayota cannot tolerate him and a raid
follows. It is a frightful chapter this; one
so strong that it is almost painful read-
Ing.
Curtis has hurt his foot and so can
take no active part, but Lindbohm. the
trained soldier, is ;a his element. There
Is plenty of heroism, but strength wins
In the end and finally the scene shifts un
til Panayota and Curtis find themselves
prisoners. Curtis passes himself off as a
newspaper correspondent and is allowed
some liberty, which he finally succeeds In
putting to such good use that both he
and Panayota are rescued by Lindbohm.
As breathless an escape as this Is it is
but tire beginning of worse difliculties.
Kostakes. as an animal creation, is cer
tainly to be admired. He Is not the sort
to give up the pursuit of so fine a prize
as Panayota without first making the ef
fort of his life, be it for good or eviKv s
Incidents pile one on top of the other
and yet are so clearly told that there Is
no confusion of. events. Curtis plays the
part of a hero and a lover with plenty of
dash when the . presence of his beloved
and the general excitement of the moment
carry him along. But when he finds that
Harper & Brothers have undoubtedly
made a find in the person of John Far
quhar Payson, author. If he can even equal
his third book, "John Vytal," Mr. Payson
has a bright future before him in the liter
ary world. True, this story is a historical
novel in. the generally accepted meaning
of that much used and III used term.
Readers are, however, already beginning
to turn aside and scent danger when the
word "historical" i3 even hinted at in
connection with a book, so it ma jT be wise
and only fair to Mr. Payson to immediate
ly explain that in this case the "histor
ical" is a very-light attack and the book
may be heartily, recommended.
. To further reassure the reader let it be
etated that, as the author himself says
It is then that the true, self-sacrificing
character of the - Swedish lieutenant is
brought out in clever and strong contrast.
As the,friend cf the American and realiz- 1
ing the other's attachment he has never
spoken of his love for Panayota, but when
he learns that CurtiJ is about to abandon
her he feels relieved from the duty of
comradeship. His act of. bravery Is for
Mr. Horton to tell, out the reader will find
that he has not been mistaken in his esti
mate of the true character of this soldier
of fortune, whose heart and sword wen>
ever ready to serve the weak or oppressed.

In a leper settlement it is a little more

Mr. Lichtenstein has evidently taken
great care to have all the details of col
lege life, correct in every particular, and
he describes the customs of daily life, the
class affairs and the : 'greater college
..events, all with a spirit that will entertain
even the casual reader and will delight
the man who holds the University of Cali
fornia as his Alma .Mater. , ' â¢
In his first days he makes himself pop
ular by paving some of, his fellow fresh
man from the wily sophomores, and then
Is rewarded by being appointed class cap
tain for the freshman-sophomore rush.
In a word, Mr. LJchtenstein's story has
this merit over all its predecessors, it is
a complete novel whose hero runs the
entire gamut of university experiences. As
a work cf fiction it is a success, but its
main interest lies in the fact that it is a
iale entirely devoted to life at the Uni
versity of California.
Mr. Lichtenstein takes as his leading
character the beet possible typeâ the poor
boy from the country who puts ' himself
through college by his own individual ef
fort. James Rawson not only supports
himself during his college term, but finds
time to acquit himself creditably in his
studies and also take a prominent part
in all the doings of his class and in the
college games as well.

the subject. The original publication grew
out of the author's own necessity for a
concise yet thorough and practical treat

has been taken to keep to the .original
design of the book. It now 'includes the
recent' interpretations of the constitution
by the courts and the important statutes
calculated to produce permanent political
effect. In addition, ' such modern topics
as our island possessions, -the Interstate

"A King's -Pawn." by Hamilton Drum
mond, is a bright, ringing story of adven
ture of the" time of Henry of Navarre and
during the trouble between Spain and
France. The book, takes as a motif a
journey, by Henry himself and two gen
tlemen of his court, together with a valet,
into Spain when feeling ran high between
the two countries. The party travel in
cognito,, but /nevertheless meet with all
kinds of hazardous' 1 escapes, and seem
ingly fatal predicaments are cons'tantly
arising.- One of the most thrilling of theso
is a vendetta, with- which a jj Spanish
woman pursues one of the King's com
panions. With all the clash of steel and
clatter of horses' hoofs the party manages,
with one exception, to escape unscathed.
The story is 'plausible, entertaining and
carries enough of Cupid's doings â¢ to give
delicate contrast to the ring of arms. The
cover design is done in a very . effective

Mr.'C. H. Foster of Alameda has written
a book which should appeal to all those
interested in the study of metaphysics
through the medium of spirit transmis
sion. His volume Js on "The Common-
Sense Philosophy of Spirit or Psychology."
The author g<?es into the matter at some
length and claims to have received all the
thoughts therein expressed from same ens
in the spirit world. He does not pose as a
man. of education, but says that all that
he has to say has come through imprt.-s
.sion.

exciting railroad strikes, and, after along

Spanish war at the head of a State regi

of the tale gets his final "come-uppance,^

General King dashes into a. story with
the spirit he would put into a cavalry
eharge. and there is no cessation of action
from cover to cover. His hero usually has
to swim in a sea of trouble, but the author
never dips him so deep that he can't pull
him out. In the abstract everybody but a
mis-anthrope likes to see virtue rewarded
and vice punished.. Unfortunately, this
is not always accomplished in real life,
but it is possible' in fiction, and General
Kingâ a health to him!â closes up his
stories with dispensations of poetic justice
that gladden the hearts of right-minded
readers.

The seagulls take life rationally. They
follow the ferry over and rest a trip,
perched f>n their pier, pluming 1 their
wings and coo'ngâ then they follow thÂ©
next boat back. â¢:?
Many have their regular seats, -where
they have sat for years, and if their reg
ular seats are taken they are thrown out
of gear for the rest of the day.
An old fellow who looks as If he had
just stepped out of one of Dickens' books
used to hurry past every body on the
ferry to get his accustomed seat.
One morning he found a number of mis
chievous university boys sitting: calmly
there. They had to run to set ahead of
the old man.
This race for thÂ© seat continued for sev
eral days. Finally thÂ© old man fidgeted
about eo uneasily that the boys gave up
the place by a unanimous vote and the
old man immediately took it and looked
happy once more.

These last-minute men for five minutes
before time to go home to the vernal side
of the .bay. keep their eyes on the ferry
clock and compare it with their watches.
Three minutes of 6 at the ferry means
loads of time. The man who has three
minutes to spare Is glutted with time.
Two minutes of 6 means time enough.
But one minute of 6 â no time to spare,
for the ferry clock jumps a minute at a
move.
"Think I'll get the boat?" said a breath
less commuter headed for the ferry.
"Well," said the old commuter, who had.
slowed up, "if you run as you are running
now you will be two minutes' late, but If
you run just as fast as you can you'll be
one minute late."
The early boats are redundant with
ycuth. The conversation of the youth is
permeated with levity and want of
thought, with random resolves. Incrim
inating Judgments against its fellow man
-tfven for tlie wit they contain. ___,_
In the cabin these early boats look as
though a reading school had been* estab
lished on board. . The newspaper fiend
reigns and he reads just certain parts of
the newspaper on his trip.
On one boat three old sports do the pac
ing stunt. One of the three for years has
been out of step. It has become a habit
with him and he accepts It as such and
never tries to change.
This eternal pacing of the deck makes
another "cult" of commutersâ the nervous
kickerâ "just about crazy."
One "cult" of commuters are known as
the deck pacers. I wonder if they ever
dream how far they have walked in the
years they have crossed the bay? Every
boat has its delegation that walks back
and forth and forth and back across the
deck all the way coming over the bay.
One of those who do the restaurant

over 2400 sinkers. He could not eat th<j

now he has to learn a new stunt.
He had taken enough brown paint called
coffee to paint his house.
"Becky Sharp" is a girl who has been
reading "Vanity Fair'.' on the ferry-boat
for months. It was not always thus with
Eeeky. She used to have a sweetheart
who was ever by her side, but they had
a row and now he lakes an earlier boat.
These early boats carry the great army
of the employed, that must be on time at
their work. Great consternation reigns
on board if the fog looks ominous and the
boat goes 6lowly.
These early boats carry the man who
woke by his alarm clock and got up and
dressed in seven minutes. His stunt 1Â»
to climb a stool In the restaurant on board
and the waiter does the rest.
The waiter glances at him and returns
with coffee and Blnkers.
"The Sure Thing" is a promoter who
says "Sure!" to everything his opponent
says and then brings in an argument that
goes him one better.
One girl Is a my?tery. She gets her
ticket punched every day and goes back
uptown again. Sometimes a fine-looking
young man pays 10 cents for a ticket on
the ferry to see her safely on the boat.
Then he bows and gets off. Just before
the ferry-boat starts she also gets off.
"The Nosegay" Is a man who always
carries a little bunch of flowers tied to
his left little finger.
"The Heax-enly Twins" are two girls
who always sit together and argue with
one another on everything, even to their
gloves.
It is said that the color of her eyes
has never been seen by her fellow com
muters. When she awakes, shamefaced,
she casts down her eyes. She is called
"The Sleeping Beauty."
One of the captain? eays that from hte
pilot-house he watches many a gradual
flirtation, then he misses the girl and finds
on Inquiry that th* flirtation has devel
oped seriously and elided in marriage.
Some of the commuters are given nick
names by virtue of their different stunts.
There is a girl on one of the early boats
â¢who falls asleep the moment she takes her
seat.
A glance of recognition Is the next step.
The following trip he tips his hat and
then the lone man and lone girl Eit to
gether.
Enter the boat a single girl and a sin
gle man. (Single here meaning alone, for
the ferrv commuters as a rule know
nothing of one another personally.) - -
The single girl and single man sit alone.
Others are chatting. Why not they? But
the well-bred commuter knows that It
takes time, so he â¢waits. He knows that
she must get used to seeing him sitting
aloof reading his newspaper perhaps
turned upside down.
Now petticoats begin to flaunt in. Neat,
trim and prim are the marks of feminin
ity on these early boats. But an observ
ing commuter says tbit they are some
times not above a harmless flirtation
He describes the nrocess as follows and
says it takes as a rule two weeks for Its
consummation.
When the deckhand shouted "All

From the 6:S0 to th; 7:45 are the heavics*

boat. Some In the lunch-room Â¦were de

A few stragglers lay sleeping around the
boiler In the center of the boat.
One man lay pillowed on his shovel, hi3

against the unearthllnpss of the hour. He

bay have been presented the palm
by universal acclamation for being the
finest in the world, any one who has spent
a day with the commuters will also grant
the ferry the palm 'or being the most

ONE day I crossed the bay at dlffir
ent hours to observe the stunts
given by tho different sets.
Whereas the lerrv-boats of our
The funniest stunt, of all is thÂ© onÂ© per
formed by the commuter who misses his
boat. He Invariably swears that â¢ he ia
going to move to San Francisco.
"All aboard!" shouts the gatekeeper
and he slams the Iron gate In the face of
the commuter.
The gatekeeper toddles to his office with
the Indifference of a Judge of the Spanish
Inquisition. The commuter who Is a quar
ter of a second late watches him blankly,
as though words were too weak to utter
his thoughts.
The commuter must wait half an hour.
It is a time when a quarter of a second
means half an hour.
An expurgated edition of his talk might
lead one. to believe that he was going to
move to San Francisco the very next day.
But he doesn't! He is five minutes early
the next nightâ that is all.
During his half-hour of waiting thÂ©
commuter will tell you what a dull place
Oakland is; how lacking it is In amuse
ments of all kinds.
He will tell you that San Francisco Ib
the only city around the bay to live In,
etc., but he will buy his commutation
ticket at the end of the month Just as he
has done for thÂ© months in the past that
have -welded themsslves into years.
If hÂ© be a commuter from Berkeley hÂ©
will tell you that it takes two hours out
of his day to live there. He will even
figure these hours up Into days and tell
you how many . months he has spent on
thÂ© ferry-boats.
But he has the commutation habit

Here is a gentleman of the cloth, a
Methodist preacher, whose mania Is sav
ing souls. He sits cm the lower deck in
order to witness the depravity of man
kind.
Outside the globe-trotter raves about
the Golden Gateâ his exit to the Orientâ
and the silent commuter sits and listens.
He never raves about anything. For ten,
twenty, thirty years he has crossed the
bay each day till he has become a regular
machine and cares not nor notices the
beautiful sunsets nor the Golden Gate.
The democratic ferry asks no questions,
but huddles together the millionaire and
the pauper, the high-toned crank and the
hard-working laborer, the Ignorant over
land emigrant and the Berkeley professor.
Here sits the poor man of large family,
who wonders In vain where he can cut
down expenses.
Beside him sits the stallfed lady of
fashion, who has absorbed -more dollars
on her beautiful gown thaAhe has ever
seen at one time. : Â¦
Sometimes a tug: must be hired. The
stolid-faced gatekeeper points down the
wharf in the direction of the tugs. It is
an every night occurrence Â¦with him. He
offers a business suggestion, but no sym-.
pathy. .
The types on the last \ boat may bo
classed as the returning pleasure-seeker,
the man who tries to think up an excuse
for h}s tardiness and the legitimate who
has toiled over his accounts and still has
not struck a balance.
In one corner Mrs. Caudle scolds her
husband. She met him with another
woman at the ferry. The other woman
wore a huge bunch of violets. These
violets seem to be the bone of contention.
Hubby says he did not buy the violets and
that wifey insulted the lady, for the poor
violets will, now be strewn over the floor
of the ferry depot.
The commuters of the ferry! "What con

what folliesâ what sermons could be
woven from this human stream, forty

himself upon his back among the new
grass and burst into a great fit of sob

However, grief with a healthy boy goon
wears itself out, and when the sobs had
subsided he gave a long, tremulous sigh
and wiped his eyes.
Another low sigh echoed his own, and
looking up he saw, seated upon the edge
of a stump beside him. a tiny and curious
creature. It had the form of a man, and
was fantastically dressed in garments of
many bright colors; hut Bob sat up and
regarded it with wide open eyes he saw
that his queer neighbor could not be over
six inches tall when he stood upon his
tiptoes. . ' ' ; Â¦ . .
. The little man wiped his eyes carefully
with a purple silk handkerchief and then
said, in quite a cheerful tone:
"I feel better, don't you?"
"Have you been crying^ too?" asked
Bob.
"Indeed, I have," was the answer. "I'm
in great trouble,' you must know, and my
heart was so heavy that it tired me to
carry it around. But I happened to 'pass
by as you were indulging in. your hearty
and sensible fit of crying, and it struck
me as just the thing to make my heart
lighter. So .1 sat upon the edge of this

FRIDAY evening little Bob said to
his mother:
"Sunday next is Easter!"
"Yes, I know." said she.
"Teacher asked us to bring flow
ers to-morrow to trim the church with,"
he continued. "All the boys and girls are
r.olnpr to bring ell the flowers they can get
to the church, and teacher will let us help
with the trimming." â¢ " "
The widow raised her head from her
Ironing and looked at her boy rather
*a<51y.
"You know, dear, Fm too busy to plant
and tend flowers," she 6ald; "and so we
have no flower garden. I need all the room
In our little back yard to dry my clothes,
too, bo we could not grow flowers if we
had the time to devote to them."
Bob nodded his head.
"I know that, mother; but all the others
will have flowers, bo I could not help
Â¦wishing I too could carry some to the
church for Easter."
The woman Ironed silently for a time.
Then she said:
"There ought to be buttercups and
daisies blooming in the North fields by
this time. Why don't you gather those?
It Isn't far to go, and there are no more
beautiful flowers in the world. Since we
have ro others, I am sure tnose would be
acceptable as an Easter offering."
Bob was delighted with the idea.
"I'll get some early to-morrow morn
ing," he exclaimed. "They are flowers,
anyway, even if they do grow wild in the
fields. But teacher said lilies were the
nicest flowers for Easter," he added,
thoughtfully. Â¦
"So they are," said his mother: "but
lilies are rare flowers in the country, and
I doubt if there are any in all the village.
So, as there will probably be no lilies
among the offerings of your companions.
I am sure your buttercups and daisies
will be as pretty as anything in the
church."
Next morning Bob was up even before
the sun, and having hastily eaten his sim
ple breakfast he caught up his cap and
ran through the village to visit the North
fields In searcn of buttercups and daisies.
Gradually the boy began to realize that
his quest was a failure, and so great was
It was a long walk for a small boy. but
Bob did not mind it, and when he reached
the fields he losf no time in beginning his
search tor the coveted flowers. Yet after
an hour's groping about he was unable to
discover anything more than a few half
opened buds of buttercups that would not
be worth gathering.
"Thon I'm not a fairy," declared the lit
tle man positively.
"Perhaps you're a brownie." ventured
Bob.
"No," "said Bob, "they don't."
"A brownie!" exclaimed the other, with
scornful emphasis. "Really now, do I
look like one of those impossible, crawly,
mischievous elves? Is ray body ten times
bigger than it should be? Do my legs
look like toothpicks and my eyes like
saucers? 1 '
Â¦ "Then I'm not a brownie," replied the
man, crossing his legs and nodding his
head at the boy in a funny way.
"Iâ I, really don't know what to make
of you," remarked Bob frankly. "Will
you please tell me what you are?"
"Certainly," ' answered " his companion,
with a bow.' "I'm d ryl."
"Oh!" said the boy.
"Do you know what a ryl is?" asked
the other, a bit sternly.
"Notâ not exactly." acknowledged Bob.
' "I ' thought not. The old nurses prefer
to talk about I those stupid fairies and
hobgoblins and never mention ryls to
. the children. And the people who write
fairy tales and gooso books and bro\Vnie
stories and such rubbish ; sit down* at
writing tables and Invent all sorts of im
possible â¢ and unbelievable things. Why
* don't they seek out the ryls, who are ser
l vants of nature, and learn from them the
â¢wonderful truths that would Instruct as
well as amuse the young folks? The ryls
have been sadly neglected, that's a fact.
And who's to blame for It?" Inquired the
little man fiercely.
"I don't know, I'm sure," said Bob. He
was sitting on the grass, clasping his
knees and looking Intently at his strange
companion, who, as he squatted on tho
Ktump, was nearly on a level with the
boy'a eyes.
The ryl laughed merrily as he noted
Bob's puzzled expression.
"I don't know who's to blame myself,"
ho said: "but since we' have mot under
such tearful circumstances, and have en
joyed our griefs together. I'll bo glad to
tell you something about the ryls. We
are servants of nuture, as I mild. All tho
things that grow Â¦ luivo to be fed just as
people do. You boys can't grow big and
ftit unless you're fed, nor can a flower
grow and blossom unless It has Its proper
food." â¢ *
â¢ "What do flowers eat?" asked Bob.
"They don't cat anything with mouths,
for they haven't any. But they absorb
their food from the oarth", sucking it up
with their roots so Â¦ that it reaches the
body of the plant and makes it grow and
bud and blossom. And the ryls place the
food in the earth for the roots to pick up."
"Oh," paid Bob. "I see."
"Each ryl has a separate kind of plant
to look after." continued the little man.
"Now I, for example, am obliged to look
after the Easter lilies." , '
."Are you, rea41y?" cried Bob, springing
to his feet in his eagerness and then sit
ting down again to be nearer the little
man.
"Why are you so excited?" inquired the
ryl.
"Because if .you tend the Easter lilies
I thought perhaps you could tell me where
to find some. Do you know where they
grow?".
"If you stop to think," remarked the ryl,
"you will see how foolish that question is.
Of course, I know where they grow. But
that reminds me of the great trouble I
amin. I certainly must start for Brazil
at once, for I have an immense field of
Easter lilies growing there, and they will
need to be cared for." .
"What is your great trouble?" askefc
Bob. ..
VWell. I'll tell you. I have had no dif
ficulty In getting most of the food required
by my lilies this spring, yet there is one
necessary thing that I've hunted for high'
and low and cannot find. . It is the only
plant food in the world that will dye the
tips of the stamens of my lilies that rich
yellow color which is so greatly admired
and which offers such a beautiful contrast
to the pure white of the leaves. There
are hosts of lilies to be supplied with this
coloring. A month or so ago I found
enough of the food In Senegambia to color
all my lilies except that one big field In
Brazil; but I fear those must now remain
.pure white since no more color food is to
be had."
"It's too bad." said Bob. sympathetical
ly, "I wish I could help you."
The ryl clapped his hands In delight
"Perhaps you can." he said, with a sly
wink at the boy. "Why do you suppose I
have been stopping here with you and
chattering nonsense unless I had a pur
pose? Ryls are not allowed to ask favors
of human beings, but since you offer to
help me of your own free will, why. there
Is no reason I should not accept the kind
ness."
"What can I do?" asked the boy, won
derlngly. 'Â¦ \ Â¦
"Your grandfather once had a bottle of
the very plant food I am In search of," re
plied the. ryl. "I don't know where he got
it or what he used it for, but he kept it
in a tall blue bottle In the cupboard over
the chimney."
"Oh. yes." said Bob. "I've seen the bot
tle often."
"Do you know where It Is now?" asked
the iyl.
"It is still in the cupboard over the
chimney. Mother has never touched it
since grandpa died, for she didn't know
what it was."
The little man rose to his feet and leant
over the edge of the stump as_ he said, in
a voice that trembled with anxiety:
"If I had that bottle I should be happy!"
"Then I'll get It for you." replied Bob.
"But if you wanted it so badly, why didn't
you go and take it?"-
"That would be stealing," answered th*
ryl. "But If you make me a present of
your grandfather's bottle you will save
my beautiful field of 'Brazilian lilies."
"I'll run for It now," cried the boy.
"Walt here until I come bock."
lie sprang up and darted away toward
the village. When he reached it he tore
down tho main street at full speed and
reached hia home almost out of breath.
His mother happened to be out at the
time, but the door was unlatched, and
Uob soon pushed a chair to the chimney
and began searching tn the high cupboard
for the blue bottle.
It stood In the exact spot his grand
father had left it, and seizing it in his
hand the boy climbed down and began
,hls return Journey without loss of time.
When he reached the North Fields there
was the ryl, sitting upon the stump and
waiting patiently. ,
Bob placed the bottle on the stump be
side the little fellow and noticed, with
surprise, that the cork reached far above
the ryl's head. "He'll never be able to
open it," thought the boy; but the ryl
did not seem a bit worried. He placed big
hand over his heart and bowed very
gravely to Bob, saying:
"I cannot tell you how grateful I am
for this favor. . You have removed all my
troubles by means of your gift. Now. in
return, tell me why you were crying when
I found you here."
"I had hoped to gather some wUdflowera
for Easter." said Bob: "but when I got
here I found they had not yet blossomed.
"We are too poor to keep a flower gar
den, you know; so when I found there
were no wildflowers it made me very sor
ry."
The ryl leaned against the blue bottle
â¢ thrust his hands deep In his trousers
pockets and whistled a tune thoughtfully.
The boy watched him with much anxiety,
for he had begun to hope the ryl would
help him. By and by the little man said:
"Well, you must come with me to Era
zil. That is the only way to help you.
When you are there I'll give you enough
lilies to make you the wonder and admira
tion of the whole village. "
"Oh. I can't go so far from home!"
cried the boy. "Mother would be dread
fully worried about me."
The ryl laughed. "It's a far Journey."
he said, "but not a long one. Hereâ take
this bottle in your left hand."
Bob obeyed, although he was somewhat
"Now give me the little finger of your
other hand." continued the ryl.
Bob held it out. and the man closed his
tiny fingers about the boy's bigger ona
in a firm clasp.
"Here we 'go!" remarked the ryl. calm
ly, and Bob trave a great start of sur
prise and amazement.
For the North fields, the stump and the
familiar landscape had entirely disap
peared, and the boy found himself stand
ins beside the ryl In the midst of a vast
field of pure white lilies, which nodded
their heads in the tropical breeze, as if
welcoming him among them.
While he admired their glorious beauty
the voice of the ryl reached his ears.
"If I don't enlarge myself I may set
stepped on. Watch mo grow!"
Bob looked down and saw the top of tnÂ»
little man's head growing gradually big
ger and rising higher and higher until the
ryl had become fully as tall as the boy.
"Now I feel safer." he said: "and if yon
will please hand me the bottle I'll get to
work and feed my flowers."
Bob gave him the blue bottle, and re
moving the cork the ryl began to sprinkle
its contents on the earth at the roots of
the lilies. He worked very quickly and
carefully, and the color food lasted until
the farthest part of the field had been fed.
Then. thÂ« bottle; being empty, the ryl re
turned to where Bob was standing and
8 "See how quickly my Ulles navÂ« rained;
their yellow-tipped stamens."
Sure enough, when Bob peeped among
the leaves he saw little caps of brilliant
yellow swaying: the slender sterna that
support them. f .;i"
"My work la now complete, centlnaea
the ryl joyously, "and as I owe my suc
cess to your kindness I shall be glad to
have you gather as many of my lilies as
you can carry home. Be sure to pick lonff
stems, for then the flowers will remain
frvsh for several "days."
The boy did not hesitate to accept this
generous offer, and soon he had gathered
a great armful of the exquisite flowers.
"These will do, thank you," said he.
But the ryl was not content. "Waitâ
waltâ wait!" he cried, laughingly, and
plucking more and more of the flowers hs
fairly loaded Bob down with them. Then
when the boy's eyes could Just see over
the top of his lilies the ryl cried out:
"Now. thenâ hold tight! Good-byâ taerw
you go!'.*
"Good-by!" answered Bob: but his volca
sounded strangely far away In his ears,
and in the same Instant he was standing
in the North fields, his anna filled with
great bunches of beautiful Easter Ultoa,
which filled tho air with their dellcat*
fragrance.

arrayed that Easter Sunday, for Hob's
lilies were .on every tide, and were tho
wonder of all who saw them. Never be*
fore had such exquisite flowers been
brought to the town, and every on* in
quired where they came from.
So Bob's story was soon well known, for
he had told his mother and the minister
all Hbout his adventure with the little ryl.
After the sermon was over the widow
approached the minister and Asked:
* "What do you think about It. -sir? DM
my boy really meet with this creature hÂ«
calts a ryl?"
"Well." answered thÂ» minister gr&vÂ«ly.
"it sounds to our ears like a very improb
able talc. But If it is not true, where did
the lilies come from?"
"They certainly never grew In thÂ© North
fields," replied the widow. "Perhaps,
sir. a miracle has come to pass!"
"Quite likely, madam," said the rood

The physicians of Trenton, N. J., are
puzzling their heads over the remarkable
case of Joseph Geskie, who increased his
weight twenty-four pounds in two days by
lying in bed and eating cinnamon buns.
Geskie appeared at a recruiting station a
few days ago. He was the picture of dis
tress. His clothes were in tatters and he
had a hungry look.
"I want to jine the army," he said to
the recruiting officer. "I've hoofed It all
the way from Connecticut, an' reckon I
don't look as cute as I might, butyl c'n
fight an' I'll show up all right, I guess. In
a. uniform."
"When Geskie sot on the scales he tip
ped the beam at 12S pounds. "Too light
for our use. young man," said the officer;
"you ouÂ£-ht to weigh up In .the forties
fccmewhere."
Two days later Keskie reappeared at the
recruiting station looking the picture of
health. His face was full and his stomach
veil rounded.
"I reckon I c'n hit the mark now," he
said, as he walked across the room and
stepped on to the scales. " The officer
weighed him and he struck the 152-pound
notch.
The officer was astounded and searched
Geskie's clothes for hidden weights, but
could find none. "How did you manage
It?" he asked.
"It's easy enough," Geskie answered;
"I've been able to change my weight ever
senee I was a boy. I went to a hotel an*
v.-ont to bed. I bought three dozen cinna
mon buns an' eat 'em as fast as I could."
â¢The name of Joseph Geskie was added
to the list of volunteers.

almost, failed me as the moments passed,
and if they had not given the signal to let
go when they did I would have Iimomln
iously backed down. As It was, I was on
the point of turning round to speak to
Van Tassel when the jerk came.
"I suppose It was a mere matter of In

run a few steps and leap with the balloon
in .order to lessen the shock of the sud

were through rope loops and the Â¦ Una
would have held me had unconsciousness
: come, but with the Ir&t wave of fright
passed I actually begun to enjoy myself.
"I looked down and could see a wonder
ful panorama rapidly unfolding under* me.
I have seen the .same *hing many times
since, but a more novel right nevei; struck
my vision. Mountains seemed to be slow
* ly" leveled and the waters of the laVa
gradually to spread over tee earth, then
rapidty to recede. I " looked up and was
shocked to find the balloon gone. Appar
ently I was suspended from nothing but a
hundred feet Â¦ of taut rone. In fact. *he
bag had simply gone 'nto a cloud and was
out of sight.
"The next instant I beard the signal
shot from the professor's revolver. Jly
hand went out in search of* the. cut-off
rope/ I clutched it, then' I let it go again.
My heart was in my throat. 'Just one
pull,' said my b'rain. Again my hand went
out. Again I hesitated. Only a little tag
and then, what? 'Weli, if I had had any
idea, of how long it. took the old style
'chute to open I would never have plucked
up courage enough to pull .that cord. My
heart was beating a' tattoo in my breast
and it was about all that I c/Suld do to
.hold, on. I cautiously tried "the rope. It
seemed to be working. Then I cut loose.
''It-was a clear drop of several hundred
feet before r there was any staying of the
downward momentum. A sickness that
seemed mortal possessed me.- A drowning
man, they say, sees his life pass before
him In review. I saw nothing, I felt
everything. My only recollection is of a
. horror, a terrible black shape crouching'
Just above me. I did not even -think to
look at the chute. I simply held on and
fell/fell.
"Then just before unconsciousness
came, just as I had made up my mind
that the thud was coming the next mo
ment, I seemed to awake from a dream
to find myself sailing slowly, oh, so slow-
ly. It seemed, down to earth again, al
though really at the rate of 100 feet a sec
ond The change came so swiftly that It
did not seem reaL
"But there before. me was the prettiest
and most welcome sight I had ever seenâ
the lake; the. mountains, the tiny human
specks on the beach. Off to one side I
saw the big balloon just toppling over for
Its drop. A minute later I struck the
beach with a suddenness that jarred me
almost unconscious.
"The next moment a half score of boat
men were pulling in my direction. A spe
cial prize of $25 had been offered the man
who picked me up if I landed in the lake, *
and the nearest man was hurriedly shout
ing to me to jump in so he could get me,
promising to divide. I tnought too much,
of my new tights, however, and then the
professor came up beaming his congrratu-
latlons. It seems I had really made a star
ascension. While I had sat studying
whether to pull or not to pull, the 'chute
had followed the balloon cut of sight and
when I came down it was a veritable
tumble from the clouds.
"Since then I have made hundreds of
leaps, but I have nÂ°ver entirely lost the
feeling of dread my first journey gave me.
The 'chutes In use now open almost at
once after they are cut loose, and a man
gets no such nervous shock as the old
ones with their" slow, steady openings
gave. . # p
"The descent formerly was too rapid for
calculation, and no man could have the
least sensibility of what was going on
about him. He simply held en and hoped
for the best. If the 'chute did not open
he would never feel the Impact with thÂ»
earth. ; He would be dead to all feeling
long before he reached it.
"Danger? No, not so very much. If a
man kept, his gear in good shape tho
"chute always opened. Several times men
have been killed by its failure to do so.
but it ' was because triey did not watch
their gear.
"The cutting loose waa done by a pair
of knives placed' like a scissors over the
connecting rope between chute and bag,
and if the lever did not work, all a man
had to do was to wait until the air Inside
the bag cooled off and lost Its hoisting
powers. Then the descent was mora
perilous, because of the balloon's weight,
but not much, as the air generally held
out till the earth was reached."
Un'/^i Pacific Railroad began its attempt
to make the Great Salt Lake in Utah a
popular inland seaside resort. All sorts of
attractions were offered. Among . them
were various torts of outdoor perform
ances of the kind* made familiar by the
circus.
"My partner and I were doing a trapeze
turn at the beach. One day as we sat at
'lunch in a downtown restaurant my eye
fell upon a big three-sheet poster an
nouncing the first balloon ascension by
the great Van Tassel at Garfield Beach
on the following day. Parachute jumping
was little known in those days, and we
made merry over the Impossibility of do
ing what was set forth on the poster.
"At the next table sat a man who
seemed m5ghti!v'intcrested Inour. conver
sation. The bills eet .forth some immense .
sum that was to be paid the famous trav
eler of the air. and I remarked that I
would be perfectly willing to make the
trip for $100. The n?xt day as we were
walking on tho bearh the man we hid
seen in tho restaurant nnproarhed a'nd be
pan ta'king ballÂ«on. He allied if I v/qs
prepared to make good the offer of the
day before. I was dee'dedly taken aback
and began to stammer a* reply.
"Then he explained that he was " Van
Tassel, and that he ana hi? wife lived in
San ' Francisco. The engagement ha-J
been mad(! by telegraph and in the hurry
of packing his canvass the balloon use-J
by his wife had been substituted for his
own. / ; ''
"You know that parachutes are of dif
ferent dimensions, graded according to the
weight of the performer. His wife
weighed 1S5: he weighed 170: and to use her
outfit was out of the question. He said he
was to get $1200 for eight ascensions and
if he could not get a substitute he would
.have to throw up the contract. He of
fered me $300 if I would go up the first
two days, by which time he expected his
balloon would arrive.
"It is a point of honor with show peoDle
to make good their little bluffs, and while
I was hesitating he k?pt shoving at me
column after column cf newspaper clip
pings Intended to prove that there was
nothing dangerous about the leap. Tho
upshot of it was that I look him up, an.1
that afternoon I â¢ decked myself â¢ In my
prettiest pair of tights, determined to die
beautifully if not bravi-ly.
"I must have shown something of my !n
ward misgiving In my eye, as the pro
fessor gave me a last opportunity to back
out. I was game, however, and let them
tie the lifeline to me and graspad the bar
in both hands.
"The bag looked like a live monster .13
RIDING the bag is boy's play howai
days," raid the retired aeronaut, as
he tossed aside a batch of circulars
explaining how easy andrafe par
achute jumping is in this age of mechan
ical achievement, and incidentally calling
attention to the extraordinarily low prices
for which aerial outfits were offered.. "It
wasn't so ten yoars ago. J
"Then a man ma5e an ascent that was
an ascent. He didn't begin working the
lever the minute he got above the tree
tops and could just about make out where
to land. Instead he let the machine al
most roach the cloud line; then he let
loose and cam-? down in full view of the
people for miles around. Such an ascen
sion was worth while seeing, and it was
well worth making.
"Parachute jumping Is a modern ad
junct to the ballooning business. The rec
ords are silent as to the identity of its
inventor, but it is not more than fourteen
or fifteen years sftice it was first attempt
ed. Hundreds and even thousands of dol
lars* were paid in those days for a single
ride.
"Out at Quincy, III., alorg in 1STS. lived
two young fellows named EaldwinJ By
dint of long practice in the gymnasium
they became experts on the bar and tra
peze. Both were, daring athletes and they
turned their training and nerve to Rood
account. They were among the first to_
take up the new idea, and gave exhibi
tions of dropping from the clouds in va
rious parts of the world, including Con
stantinople, Vienna, Berlin and Calcutta.
They camd home in 1S00 with $100,000 clear
money. To-day they are among the sub
stantial citizens of their home town, own
ers of the baseball nark and proprietors
of a big factory, which turns out every
thing needful for an aeronaut.
"Another of the p5oneers*was Professor
Van Tassc!. He taught his wife the busi
ness and the pair of them made big
money before competition cut prices to
pieces. Van Tassel, by the way. Is dead
now. About four years ago he went to
the Hawaiian Islands and made the first
ascension ever witnessed in Honolulu. Un
fortunately for him he dropped into the
Pacific Ocean and was eaten by sharks
before the eyes of his wife, who had gone

. The faces of the little creatures are cov

Van Dykes; ; the" points . touching the hair
on the forehead and neck. Their lips are
heavily rouged in the center, which make
the mouths look small and the. lips very

a penciled dot I Is placed ' above each one,
midway between it and the hair. â¢ So mo

Their long black hair Is caught together
at the nape of the neck with loops of
gold paper and then folded In soft, white
rice paper and left to hang, down ; the
back. In the front of the hair are thrust
long hairpins, decorated with clusters of
wistaria and red camellias, which stand
out like horns. Each dancer carries an
old court fan, made' of wooden . sticks,
strung together. with. multi-colored silken
cords, and a curious double-decked rattle,
from which hang long ends of colored silk.
The music furnished by the priests, who
put on . over their ordinary dress cere
monial growns, which reach to their heels.
On their heads they set queer shaped,
high black hats. - They sit on the soft
white mats and pound the temple drums
and blow . a discordant noise from pipes
that would have driven Fin mad with tor
ture, while the priestesses move languidly
through the solemn- figures of the dance.

light, swift walk within a circle, then they

tothe style of the writing many of these
tablets date from 2000 B. C. or earlier.

The fact has also been proved that an
terior' to the making of the Hittite in
scriptions, found elsewhere, an entire
primitive civilization was developed In
Cappadocia by this remarkable people,
coming we know not whence, and their
close connection with the Babylonians at
a very ancient date is no less conclusively
proved.
In summing up the- results of these ex
cavations the explorer holds that they
prove the date of the Hlttltes to be much
earlier than has usually been supposed,
running back to at "least 3000 B. C. He
suggests that this date should be assigned
to the foundation of the palace and fort
ress of Boghax-Keui. as well as of the
other cities found In this locality.

Nor is it possible to belleva that the
Cappadoclans could have borrowed from

Cappadocia the axes and stone Implements
of the earliest period resemble those found
in Armenia far more than they do those
of Greece. It Is peculiar that at Euyuk.
as at- Hlssarlik, incineration seems to
have been the method of disposing of the
dead, rather than any kind of buria.1- .
Passing to the southern part of Cappa
docia, M. Chantre found Indisputable
proof that the Hlttltes had occupied this
part of the country completely, for there
at Ferak-Edln was a great bas-relief. It
was only a few miles from thÂ» village of
Feraktln, cut into the cliff over a stream.

well as the coarser pottery and the heads

Concerning the sixteen tablets found at
Euyuk, M. Chantre states that while the
writing on these tablets seems to ap
proach that usually found on similar As
syrian tablets, the forms of some of the
characters differ materially from those
used by the Babylonians. Â¦ That these
characters so used were a variation In
troduced by the Hlttltes after borrowing
the method of writing seems certain on
account of the Hittite monuments, amid
Which these tablets were discovered.
It is surprising to learn from one of the
tablets that It ' was the custom even at
that remote date to pay Interest" on loans,
and that sums of money were loaned by
the priests for the temple, and that; on
the other hand the priests sometimes bor
rowed from the people, but at their risk.
One of the tablets reads: "If all of his
money makes a 'profit In the temple
Sahamilrama may take the profit, but if
the money Is lost in the temple Sahamil
rama loses It." . '
It Is proven also by the architectural
remains and the pottery found that the
Hlttltes were possessed . of a civilization
closely, approaching' that of the Aegeana
at. a verjf distant period. M. Chantre has
no doubt that the relations between the
Hlttltes and the Babylonians extended aS
far back as 3000 B.Â« C. The "Information
as to the life of the ancient Hlttltes is
fuller on account of these researches, and

form writings at fioghaz-Keul show that
the relations between the Hittltes and the
Assyrians were very ancient indeed.
, The mission of M. Chantre
to Cappadocia had for its pur
pose to investigate this Hit
tite problem, and its results
are of the first importance.
He Trent to Boghaz-keul, and
was the first to excavate the
sites of this famous old Hit
tite capital. There he found
baked clay tablets, in Assy
rian script, but some of them
in the language of the Hit
tites. This will settle the na
ture of the language and help
us finally to read the peculiar
Hittite hieroglyphics, not yet
satisfactorily deciphered. A,
multitude of other objects
found by him throw light on
ths art of the people. When
we remember that Hittite cul
ture covered*all Asia Minor,
and that its art is hardly dis
tinguishable from the Myce
naean, the mother of Greek,
we cannot too highly value
such investigations as those
of M. Chantre.

It has been Impossible to trace all of the
letters of the Greek alphabet heretofore,
and it Is uncertain whence these letters
came, but now In the light of the discov

than probable that the inscriptions found
at Mycenae and in Cyprus, which have
astonished many scholars by their like
ness to Hittite characters, may have been
derived from this ardent and powerful
race. ,
Relation of the Greeks.
The texts which he has found are writ
ten In cuneiform characters, but In some
unknown language, which every one be
lieves to be Hittite. The texts have been
read as If they were Assyrian, for the
values of the . syllables are well known,
and here undoubtedly, the interpretation
of the Hlttite language lies.
There Is, however, much more than thÂ«
mere reading of unread monuments in the.
discoveries of M. Chantre, for In Cappa
docia he has found not only Hlttite re
mains, but remains of Pelasgic civilization
as welL An entirely novel Held of specu
lation, which has been broached before,
but never with great force. Is now laid
open for future investigation.
While this is what has been waited for
and expected, aid comes in a peculiar, un

lead to the solution of this age long mys

that he found the texts which may reveal
the whole truth and furnish the key to

"While Professor Hllorecht and a few

Professor Jensen, a skilled Assyrlologist,
has written several volumes upon the de
cipherment of the Hittitc Inscriptions, but
few accept his conclusions. He holds that
the Hittltes borrowed their alphabet from
the Egyptians, but that the Hato-Arme

A VERDICT of murder in the first
degree, with the punishment fixed
at life imprisonment, was returned
by the jury yesterday In the trial
of Robert E. Glaze, who killed his
partner, William Trewhella, at the "Wind
sor Hotel on the afternoon of January 14
last
During the two weeks' trial neither.
Glaze nor his wife betrayed the slightest
emotion as they sat in court and listened
to the mass of testimony presented by the
prosecution. The scathing denunciation
delivered by Assistant District Attorney
Greany yesterday did not cause Glaze to
-wince. He sat -with the same immobile
countenance he wore during the whole
trial.
Not even when the jury returned Its
verdict did Glaze betray his feelings. He
was quickly hurried to the prison van and
taken to the County Jail./^ .
Mrs. Glaze and her two young daugh
ters and son gave no sign when the ver
dict was returned. They took their leave
of the condemned man, but there was no
outward manifestation of sorrow. The
family of Trewhella, the murdered man;
were not In court when the jury returned
its verdict.
Denounced in Scathing Terms.
When court convened yesterday morn
ing Assistant District Attorney Greany
delivered the closing argument for the
prosecution. He reviewed the evidence in
detail and characterized Glaze in scath
ing, terms, claiming that he had com
mitted one of the most cold-blooded mur
ders In the annals of crime.
Judge Dunne took half an hour in deliv
ering his charge to the jury and elaborate
ly explajncd the law of self-defense. The
jury received the case shortly before 1 p.
m. and Judge Dunne allowed the jurors to
be taken to luncheon at that time. They
were brought back to the juryroom at 2
p. m. and brought in their verdict at 4:20
p. m. When the verdict was read the at
torneys for the defense made no motion
for a new trial and Judge Dunne set May
4 as the date for sentence. %
Glaze was a well-known figure in the
hotel world. For three years previous to
the destruction of the Baldwin Hotel he
was chief clerk of that hostelry, and it
was there jÂ£ met Mrs. Shelly, who is now
his wife. T3he was a guest of the hotel,
having her two daughters and two sens
with her. She was reputed to be worth
much money. After the hotel was de
stroyed by fire Glaze and Mrs. Shelly
were married and went to Honolulu!'. â¢ On
their return to this city Glaze and a man
named Janes purchased the lease of the
Windsor Hotel.
How Glaze First Met Trewhella.
The prospects of the new firm looked
bright. Janes, however, desired to sell his
interest, and early In 1900 William Trew
hella became the partner of Glaze, buying
the interest of Janes. Trewhella was a
?miner, a Cornishman by birth and had
lived In Nevada for eighteen years, where
he had amassed a snug sum of money by
hard work. There were frequent differ
ences between Trewhella and Glaze, and
i the matter culminated in January of this
BpecUl Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, April 20.â The war
cloud 6tUl hangs ominously over Midway
oil district. The second clash of arms
that appeared to be so Imminent yesterday
did not take place last night. The vigi
lantes either had enough or withdrew to
readjust their plan of campaign. The
claim-jumpers still hold their ground and
apparently are ready for eventualities.
They expected a renewal of the attack
last r.ight.
Whether or not any more blood will
flow no one can now foretell, but the
trouble that led to Thursday night's bat
tle is yet to be settled. The Mount Diablo
people say It is their land and they mean
to have It and the jumpersâ the Superior
Sunset menâ declare with equal force that
they are going to hold the fort and de
velop the land. â¢ â¢
"Wounded Men "Will Die.
The wounded men. J. T. Walker and
G. P. Cornell Jr., are still living, but are
expected to die at any moment, so terri
ble arc their wounds. They were taken
to McKlttrick to-day with a view of
bringing them here, but they did not get
there in time to catch the train for
BakersSeld. Word from McKittrick this
evening reported them to be very low.
Walker was at one time Sheriff and
Supervisor of Humboldt County, Nevada.
Those who know him say he is a fine
gentleman with a good reputation. His
connection with the trouble fcas not yet
been explained satisfactorily. Some of
the Superior Sunset people, who came in
to-dAy Trom the scene of the conflict, say
he on'y a visitor to the camp, while
Judge Clafiin, counsel for the company,
Eays Walker "went out to assist the boys
a little." Cornell's reputation is that of
b "gun- fighter."
The Superior Sunset men, who are fn
from the battlefield, convey a hazy Idea
of the combat They intimate that Cor
nell did aJl the shooting and they cannot
give any explanation as to how "Walker
was shot, except that "the bullets flew
as thick as hail everywhere." They de
scribe the affair as a terrific fusillade.
The cookhouse and water tank show the
effect of the rain of lead. Tbe .claim
jumpers were expecting an assault, yet
they were all but surprised.
Not the "Work of Vigilantes.
The jumpers declare that the attack
en them was perpetrated by the Mount
Diablo crowd ajid not by vigilantes. They
claim to know who their assailants were
end say there were about twenty-five of
them, many of whom are prominent citi
zens of Bakersfield, Fresno and Los An
geles. It was very dark when the fight
took place. To-day Cornell, when visited
by E. J. Boust of Fresno, identified him
as one of his assailants. Boust replied:
"I don't like to call a dying man a liar,
but you are very much mistaken."
The Mount Diablo men do not deny be
ing near the scene of battle when It
raged and say there -were some weapons
in the crowd. All expect to be arrested.
Judge Claflln said to-day, with consid
erable vehemence, "We shall bring crim
ij^j action against them," and then hur
ried off to find the District Attorney.
Sheriff Borgrrardt said the men would be
arrested. All are citizens in good stand
ing.
Some deny the existence of vigilantes
on the west side, while others declare
there is such an organization and It
means to stamp out the deplorable prac
tice of claim-Jumping. One of the Mount
Diablo men said to-night, when asked if
they were groing to give up the fight,
"If you knew what was going on you
â¢would not think so."
Fight Over Another Claim.
While the conflict on 26 Is going on
there is trouble of a. similar nature tak
ing place on 25, the next section. A Fres
no party, headed by City Attorney Lan
nlng of that city, it is claimed, is try
ing to jump 25. The party was driven
off by men with rifles. To-day these men
were arrested and brought to town. They
declare the Fresnoans will not get the
land, though they "nave to wade through
lakes of blood."
The situation In Midway and other por
tions of the "West Side at present Is prom
ising for armed conflicts. ThÂ© first loca
tors are becoming desperate. They say

VICTORIA, B. C, April 20.â Two hundred miners, prospectors
and others are said to have been frozen to death at Cape
Nomeâ and this in the Immediate vicinity of the Arctic camp
as the result of an a.wful blizzard that swept the Bering Sea
coast early tills yeax. Three arrivals at Dawson from Cape
Nome told the story of the blizzard and Its harvest of dead.
Their account, with details of the finding of great numbers of dead on.
the trail, in the snow drifts and in the huts and cabins of the mines
and camps, was telegraphed to Skaguay, whence it was brought by
the steamer Danube, which reached port to-day. No names of the un
fortunates who met death are given, but the Nome men tell a startling
circumstantial story of the calamity.
In the camp at Cape Nome the loss of life Is said to be not as heavy
as Â¦ In the surrounding camps and ' on the trails, but the camp did not
go unscathed_ during the' storm. Hundreds were carried to the hospitals
with frozen limbs, and others were left suffering .In their huts!

It was in the surrounding parts of the district ; that the death .record
was heaviest. Not until after the storm had passed was the extent of
the calamity realized 'at Nome, for it was not until then, that searching
parties came upon bodies of victims. Some were found in tents, whose
thin canvas afforded no shelter; -others In huts of boards and -tar pa
per, and, in many instances, ' without even, the tar paper to protect,
them from the cold; but the greater number were found; half -buried" in

from the cold, and It was with the greatest difficulty : that hundreds of
lives "were saved. Medical skill was called on many times and the hos
pitals were full of people' who were frozen on seme part of the body.
The capacity of the St." Bernard Hospital was taxed to its utmost, and
too much . credit cannot.be given to Mr. Elliott, -who Is in charge, for
his care of the sufferers.
. v *'On Jhe occasion of the storm In question a blizzard was blowing,
and .when it abated the bodies of 200 miners -were found lying all along
the coast. * Some, of the unfortunates had. gone to Port Clarence to

therefore, connected with * ne Bell Com

The Real Significance.
Attorney E. S. Plllsbury, who has been
intimately acquainted with the business
of the telephone: companies, said last even- j
Ing that some years ago Mr: Sabin was
talked of in connection with .tne presi
dency of ' the* American Bell Telephone
Company of Bouton. John E." Hudson, who j
was then ' the president'of the Boston cor- ;
pqration,- thought very highly of Mr.; Sa- \
bin. It was also proposed at one time that
Mr. Sabin should be made -the executive ,
head of the telephone business in New
York. "All the significance there is to the
move," said "Mr. Pillsbury, "is that it is .
desired \.o' have in Chicago a-: system as :
good- as possible. The fact is that San
Francisco, with a population of 350,000, has

with three times the population, that San
Francisco has, can show only. 26,000 tele

PITTSBURG, Pa. , April 20.â This city
Is the center of a widespread and .disas
trous storm. Fora radius of 150 miles in
Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio and Northern
West Virginia rain or snow has been fall
ing almost without' intermission for three
days. Mountain streams have become tor
rents, creeks are swollen and out of their
banks and the big rivers are oceans of
turbid water.- Flood records, it is expect
ed, will be broken before the water sub- i
sides. .
The financial loss cannot be estimated.
In addition to hundreds of thousands and
perhaps millions of dollars it will cost
to put large manufacturing plants in com
mission again, tens of thousands of skilled'
workmen are thrown out of employment
and lose their wages just at a time when
all the iron and steel mills are rushed with
orders.
Living in Upper Booms.
To-night; thousands of people. are living
in the upper rooms of their water-soaked
houses, without heat, light or food.
Where eras fuel is used the pipes are
flooded and cut off. " At Schoenville, the
home of the Pressed Steel Car Company,
the little town is completely surrounded
by water. The workers -and their families'
constitute a community of 'several thou
sand persons. Â¦' '.
Â¦Wheeling; W. Va., fears the most dis
astrous flood in its history.. The weather
wise say the river will Â¦ make a new high
record at " that point. The mountain
streams of the State are gushing down
the hillside with resistless force. Behind
this comes the flood tide of the Ohio,. fed
by the. Monongahela, Allegheny, Beaver
and other tributaries. From 45 to 50 feet
of : water Is feared at. Wheeling, which
means ah immense'rlos'sT of" property. '.
Heaviest Snowstorm Ever Known.
In many parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio
probably the Â¦" heaviest snowstorm '.Â¦ ever
known at this season of the year has been
racing for two days. At Oil' City the oil
exchange went out of business tempo
rarily because it was impossible to secure
quotations from New York, PIttsburg and
other points.
On one railroad in Ohio passenger trains
are stalled, and engines sent to their as
sistance have been bujied with snow, and
all must, wait with a hope for a speedy
turn of the weather. Â¦ In the meantime
the passengers must depend upon near-by
farmhouses for. sufficient food to keep
them from starving.
Â¦ Business, religious services to-morrow,
comfort and health are at the mercy of
the storm. Several narrow escapes from
death have been reported,' and it is prob
able that when the flood subsides it may
reveal a number of bodies. .Â» t;
Steam . and steel . railroad tracks are
buried under thousands of tons of earth
washed down the hillsides, and in some
cases the tracks have been moved. Where
the snow Â¦ and : sleet . prevailed the tele-"
graph wires and poles- went down under
the burden and costly railroad and other
bridges have been washed away and their
piers weakened. The big manufacturing
plants in this city have suffered severely.
The cost of repairs is but a small item in
comparison to : the \ d^elay in . filling ' the
orders with ' which all 'the plants are
crowded. ' '
. River Mills Are Submerged.
The iron mills along the river were. early
afflicted and one by one were compelled
to shut down, the water putting out the
fires 'and .submerging the '.works.
Mrs. Mary Patterson, . 80 years Â¦ old, liv
ing in River avenue, Allegheny, in th&
submerged district, died ' of Â¦' excitement
this evening." ; Four Hungarians are re
ported drowned near Sharpsburg, but the
report cannot be verified at this hour.
At midnight Frank Ridgeway, localoffiT
cial forecaster, issued a bulletin to â¢ the
effect that the Allegheny and Mononga
hela" rivers would probably reach the 29
foot mark, while the .Ohio would reach
thirty feet, or four feet less than the dis
astrous flood of 1S84. .The marks in the
Monongahela River at midnight were 28.6
feet and the river was rising at the rate
of three and a' half inches an ihour. In
the Allegheny 28.5 feet was the reading on

CINCINNATI. April 20.â Peculiar weath
er conditions during the week have cul
minated in a rain and snow storm of al
most unprecedented Amensions, so dis
tributed that a tremendous flood In the
Ohio River is impending. It is too early
to predict the extent of the coming flood,
but all signs point to a stage of water
that must bring devastation of a most se
rious nature ail along the Ohio River and
Its tributaries in. Ohio, West Virginia and
Kentucky. The condition is somewhat of
a surprise at Cincinnati, because, while
there has been rain almost every day In
the week, it was not heavy enough to
create apprehension. But above Cincin
nati, in Kentucky and West Virginia
flood rains were falling as early as
Wednesdav, and over a vast extent of the
Ohio River Valley watershed It was con
tinuous. This heavy rain served to cause
a rise In the Ohio River until this morn
ing it was rising all the way from Pitts-
VKirg to. Louisville. Following these rains
came the tremendous snowfall of last
night, which reached from Canada to At
lanta, with Its western border less than a
hundred miles from Cincinnati. By Its
mere weight and by the force of the wind
in many places there was almost a com
plete paralysis of all wire communication
across this snow belt to-day. From
twelve and fifteen inches of snow lies
over Eastern Ohio and over the greater
part of "West Virginia and Eastern Ken
tucky. This is supplemented by heavy rain
In the region of the headwaters of the
Ohio to-day. The Weather Bureau official
1b confident that the rain must soon cease,
but -with warmer weather the vast snow
area will melt and add to the great vol
ume of water. It is possible, however,
for a flood of disastrous proportions to
sweep down the Ohio Valley within the
next few days. It is estimated that a
stage of 42 feet at Cincinnati will be
reached by to-morrow. All agree that 50
feet will surely comet How much more

Mark Reached.

CINCINNATI, Oh'io, April 20.â Specials
from Upper Ohio Valley to-night indicate
great alarm among the Inhabitants of
towns along tne Ohio River and â¢ tribu
taries. The flood has already reached
many places. Although the rise was more
sudden than ever Â¦ before, yet all points
received more timely -notice than in for
mer years, on account of the extra vigil
ance of the weather bureau. As a rule
those located in the lower districts to
night are moving to higher ground. This
precaution Is being taken along the river,
.front of Cincinnati, although the rise can
not reach this city for a couple . of days.
The situation in Northern and Eastern
Ohio is reported worse than ever. Many
places have been cut oft all day and are

KESWICK, April 20.â For the sixth time
In. four years Keswick has had a big fire.
This morning ilames broke out in Barbary,
Coast and all North Main street is now in
ashes. Fifteen places of business have
been destroyed, together with half a dozen
dwellings, entailing a total loss of about
530,000. The buildings constituted a long
frame range. None of the owners had
been able to obtain Insurance, so to-day's
Joss is totaL Little or no stock was saved.
Tbe fire broke out in the Mascot saloon,
eontfucted by Cecil & Bray. There was
so wind and the flames crept southward,
â¢lowty but surely sweeping everything be

Blue Wing saioon of Oakley & Munga,
John Moreen's saloon. John Perth's res
taurant, Pete Bernal's saloon, Carpenter
& GonzaJes' barber shop, Gus Bauer's sa
loon and Joe Borde's laundry. With much
difficulty the Sre -was stopped here and
prevented eating its way into the most
important business part of the town. .
To the northward from the starting
point -were destroyed the Monte Carlo
Theater building, a large two-story frame
leased by Harry Monroe; John Miller's
saloon, John Ramsey's restaurant, Herold

SUISUN,*' April 20.â D. E. Gleason, who
is employed by the railroad company as
transfer'man at. the depot at night, took
a small boat yesterday morning and start- j
ed for .a short..sail,on the slough.. With j
a strong out-going, tide- arid^ a high wind.j
sailing proved such' it pleasure that Mr.-;
Gleason did not start: to return 'to town !
until he had almost reached Suisun Bay.
When he endeavored to retrace his course,
being unfamiliar with the winding slough,
he soon lost his way: , He spent the -re- j
mainderof the day wandering around- in |
the numerous sloughs and small water-J
ways in the great tule basin south of
Suisun. When night came. on he had no!
idea of his whereabouts and looked with ,
fear upon the prospect of having td spend
the. night in the tules. A strong wind,
piercing cold, came on and Mr. Gleason
tied his boat to tho bank of the slough
and walked about in the tules all night
in an effort to -keep himself as warm as
possible. When morning came he had be- ,
come thoroughly discouraged and. had
given. up all hope cf finding his way to -
Sufsun without assistance.
When il became known this morning
that Gleason had not returned his friends
feared he had fallen into the slough and
been drowned. His mother in Oakland
was notified and Constable Charles H.
Downing and John Mackin took a boat
and some grappling irons and started on
a hunt for the missing man. At 10:30
o'clock they found him on Dead Man's
Island, about three miles from town. It
was there he had spent the night and he
was waiting for some one to come to his
assistance. '. Â¦ ;
Gleason had, bee.n- without food or drink
for nearly twenty-eight hours and when
he was found he was in a very weak con
dition. The cold and exposure of the
night had had a bed effect upon him.
He seemed flighty at times, but he recog
nized his rescuers and could not find
words to fully express his thankfulness
to them for having come to his relief.
He was quickly brought to town and after
eating a hearty meal and getting
thoroughly warmed he began to recover
from his terrible experience. He anys he
suffered most from thirst during the day
and from cold at night. . r

"Peruna Is the greatest medicine on
earth. I feel well and that tired feeling
is all gone. When I began to take your
medicine I could not smell nor hear a

Peruna cured me."â Mrs. Al Wetzel.
If all the tired women and all the nerv-
ous women and all the women that needed
a tonic would read and heed the words
of these three fair ladles who have- spoken
right to the point, how many Invalids
would be prevented and how many wretch-
ed lives be made happy.
Peruna restores health In a normal way.
Peruna puts rlcht all the mucous mem-
branes of the body, and In this way re-
stores the functions of every organ.
If it la* the stomach th;\t is out of order

LOGGING CONTBACTOBS ,
CALLED TO ACCOUNT
Government Inspectors Curb the Un
lawful Activity of Lumbermen
on the Indian Lands.
MINNEAPOLIS. April 20.â The Journal'
to-day prints a page report of its Investi
gations Into the depredations on the Chip
pewa Indian reservations this winter by
logging contractors under the "dead and
down" act. In almost every camp quan
tities of BTeen timber have been cut. In
many instances the logging contractors
openly admitted illegal cutting. The spe
cial Government Inspectors found that out
of 49,000,000 feet cut this winter 9.000,000
feet had been illegally cut. Joseph R.
Fair, the special inspector sent to investi
gate by Indian Commissioner Jones, has
force'd the lumbermen to buy these logs
of the contractors and to pay for them
at $11 a thousand, thus securing for the
Indian fund $100,000 extra.
Captain W. A. Meyer, the Indian Agent
at Leech Lake, has closed up several
camps entirely. He and Mr. Farr have
gone to Chicago to report to Commissioner
Jones.

The schooner Carrie and Annie has been
purchased by the American Board of For

cruise among the Caroline and Marshal
groups. The Carrie and Annie was built
at Essex, Me., and during the Klondike
rush came here with a party of gold hunt
ers. When the party reached St. Michael
the schooner was sold and her new own
ers sent her cod fishing. Then she was
purchased by A. P. Mordaunt and last
year be fitted her out for Nome. Sinco
her return from that trip she has been
laid up in Oakland Creek.
The steamship Jeanie will not get away
for Nome until 1 p. m. to-day. A lot of

ONE of the prettiest spectacles seen
on the bay In a long time was
the launching of the four-masted
schooner Mindoro from Hay &
Wright's yards, Alameda Point,
yesterday afternoon. .. There must have
been over 500 people aboard the vessel
when she slid into the bay and their
cheers mingled with the sounds of the
steam whistles as the handsome craft was
christened. Nearly every shipmaster in
town was present at the- launching.
! The Mindoro is 175 feet long, 38 feet 6
inches beam and 14 feet deep. Martin
Sanders is her managing owner and she
makes the sixth vessel of the same class
turned out by Hay & Wright for his syn
dicate. The first one was the Philippine,
then came the Expansion, Luzon, Com
merce, Forester and now the Mindoro.
Another schooner 17 feet longer than the
Mindoro is now nearing completion at Hay
& Wright's for the same syndicate. The
schooners now In commission have been
all over the world and everywhere they
have been praised for their beauty, speed
and strength.
The Mindoro will be sparred at Alameda
Point and will probably go into commis
sion about the middle of May.

fourth one of the alleged Goebel suspects
to be tried. The Jury in the Ripley case
was composed exclusively of Democrats.
Although the Jury was out two hours,
meet of the time was J taken up in dis

two ballots were taken. On the first bal
lot ten 'Jurors voted "not guilty" and two
voted "guilty." The two who voted guilty
said they believed the evidence j showed
him connected with the conspiracy, but
when they learned that either a life, im
prisonment sentence or the death sentence
must be ltasosed and that a shorter sen
tence would not be permissible they voted
with the majority for an acquittal.

Not a Patent Cure-All, Nor a Modern
Miracle, but Simply a Rational
Cure for Dyspepsia.
In these days of humbuggery and decep-
tion the manufacturers of patent medi-
cines, as a rule, seem to thlnK their medi-
cines will not sell unless they claim that
It will cure every disease under the, sun.
And they never think of leaving out dys-
pepsia and stomach troubles. They are
sure to claim that their nostrum is abso-
lutely certain to. cure every dyspeptic and
ho need look no further. * _
In the face of these absurd claims it is
refreshing to note that the proprietors of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have carefully
refrained from making . any. undue claims
or false representations regarding: the
merlt3 of this most excellent remedy for
dyspepsia I and stomach troubles. They
make but one "claim for it, and .that Is,
that for indigestion and various stomach
troubles Stuart's' Dyspepsia Tablets- Is a
radical cure. They, go no farther than
this and * any man< or woman suffering
from indigestion, chronic or nervous dys-
pepsia, who will give the remedy a trial
will find that nothings is claimed for it
that the facts will not fully sustain.
It -Is a moden> discovery, composed of
harmless vegetable ingredients acceptable
to the weakest or most delicate, stomach.
Its great : success In curing stomach
troubles is due to the fact that the medi-
cal properties are such that it will digest
whatever wholesome - food Is taken into
the stomach, no matter whether the
stomach is in good working order or not.
It rests the overworked organ and re-
plenishes , the body, the blood, the nerves,
creating a healthy appetite, gives refresh-
ing sleep and the blessings which always
accompany a good ; digestion and proper
assimilation of food. ," '
In using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets no
dieting is required. Simply eat plenty. of
wholesome food' and take these Tablets
at each meal, thus assisting:, and resting:
the stomach which > rapidly Â» regains - its
proper digestive power, when the Tablets
will be no longer required. , .
Nervous Dyspepsia is simply a condition
in which some portion or portions of the
nervous system are not properly nour-
ished.. Good digestion invigorates the ner-
vous* system and "every organ. in the body.
Stuart's 'Dyspepsia Tablets are sold by
al! druggists at 50 cents per package.
They are manufactured by . the P. A.
Stuart Co. :of Marshall.* Mich.'. â¢
Any druggist will tell you it gives uni-
versal satisfaction.

debility, and convalescence following certain
diseases, Euch is the lowered standard of the
vital processes that the function of no organ Is
perfectly performed, and with the resulting de-
pression the patient has a REAL weakness.
The physician's first thought, under these con-
ditions, is nerve and other tonics.
Not Weakness ; Symptoms
By far the greater number of patients, how-
ever, seeking relief for so-called "Weakness"
Is furnished by healthy and robust men. On
examination, we find a Prostate Gland which
has been damaged by either a contracted dis-
order or early dissipation. These patients
have no weaJcness at all. Prematureness, Loss
of Vitality, etc, are the symptoms, or disor-
dered function, of the chronically Inflamed
prostate eland. We find by curing this Inflam-
mation that full vigor at once returns. It
ehould be understood that tonics, electricity,
etc.. might cure a real weakness, but would do
harm in inflammation. The main object Is to
reduce the elze of the tender, 6wollen and In-
flamed prostate. This we accomplish by local
treatment, thus avoiding drugs. Men who have
unsuccessfully treated for a weakness should
now understand the cause of failure.

C. Silverthorn, the owner referred to,
came by and looked in. He saw the man,
apparently asleep, and spoke to him. Re
ceiving no answer he went over and
found that he had been addressing a
corpse.
The dead man -waa about 37 years of
age and appeared to be a laborer, or,
possibly, a sailor. He nad been dead at
least twenty-four hours. The shoes were
off his feet and a morphine vial in one
of them led to the belief that it was a
case of suicide, but on the way to the
Morgue it was discovered that the neck
was broken and that the body must have
been carried to the car after life had fled.
The police made efforts to identify the
dead man, but nothing was found except
that one man believed he was C. A. Kelly,
a laborer. The post-mortem disclosed the
fact that the neck was dislocated at the
first vertebra. An Inquest will be held
to-morrow morning.
SAN DIEGO, April 20.â A mystery which

three dray loads of hay were taken out
and the car was left unlocked, but not

decree of divorce to Frances B. Dierssen
from William I* Dierssen. The defendant
to the suit, . who is now in the East, en
tered no objection. The couple had been
married scarcely a year and their wed
ding was a brilliant event in local society

ernoon that during the last grand opera
season in San Francisco, a few months
after their marriage, Dierssen took his
wife to the metropolis to hear the divine
Melba, but on the way . to the opera, it
was alleged, Dierssen told his wife that
they were bound for .another place of
amusement. She protested agrainst the
change of programme and started to get
off the street car, when Dierssen seized
her by the arm with such force as to leave
black and blue marks.
y On another occasion, so it was testified,
Mrs. Dierssen was obliged to attend a re
hearsal at a church where she had been
engaged to sing, when Dierssen brought
home a duck and requested her to cook
it for dinner. Because she remonstrated,
on the score of lack of time, Dierssen, It
was alleged, shook her severely and

vorce to Mr. Stanley. The custody of the
boy, a child of 9, was placed with the
father's parents. It was from this de
cision Mrs. Stanley appealed and carried
the case to. the Supreme Court.
Thus the sensational fight of the Klon
dike millionaire for freedom from his
wife, which at first resulted In victory In
a lower court, has been fought In vain.

commenced, suit against his wife, has lived
away from her, must now again at least
support the wife he promised to love and
cherish. The custody of his one child,
which the decree of divorce placed In the
hands of his father and mother. Is again

This morning Mrs. Stanley, through her
attorney,- appeared In the Superior Court
and had a date set for the trial of the
damage suit she Instituted against her
husband's father and mother for the
alienating of her husband's affections. At
the time of the divorce Stanley, who en
gaged only in a lukewarm manner In the

were the only ones who employed counsel
to prosecute the suit. For this Mrs. Stan

INTERESTS THE PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
The facts stated appear in the documentary
evidence presented by the Government to the
United States Commissioner in New York upon
the hearing of the application for the removal
of Greene and the Gaynors to Georgia for trial
upon the criminal indictment. If counsel is
unaware of this, it i* because he has not con
eulted the gentlemen who represented Carter on
the former hearings before this court and are
now representing Carter's co-conspirators in the
Â¦bittÂ«r fight they are making against being re
moved to Georgia for trial. Believing from the
facts in his possession that Carter wants to get
CQt neither for his health's sake nor In order
to be tried upon the criminal charge in Geor
gia, the Solicitor General has laid before the
court the facts which in his opinion make clear
the real object of this application. For this he
has no apology to make. It is not his belief
that a convicted criminal may assail the Gov
ernment he has defrauded and assert on oath
Â¦whatever he pleases in support of his applica
tion to be released from punishment, while the
representative of this Government before this
court must stand mute and permit the charges
and statements, however reckless and false, to
go unchallenged to the court.
Recurring to the application, permit me to
cay in conclusion that the only feature which
entitled it to notice was its audacity. Its sup
posed reasons were worthless, its alleged facts
wholly without support. Taken at its best, the
argument amounted to this: That Carter, hav
ing been convicted by one tribunal. Ehould be
released on bail â and thus while at large serve
out a sentence already justly imposed â in order
that he may be arraigned before another tri
bunal. Time enough for him to be released
for another trial when he has served, out his
present sentence.
WASHINGTON'. April 20.â Solicitor Gen
eral Richards to-day filed in the United
States Supreme Court a reply to the mo
tion made by the counsel of Captain O.
M. Carter to strike from the files of the
"court -as irrelevant and scandalous the
Solicitor General's brief in opposition to
Carter's motion to be admitted to bail
pending the decision of his appeal in his
habeas corpus proceedings.
Mr. Richards denies that he went out
eide the record in his case and asserts
that he always tries to observe strictly
the rules of the court requiring counsel
to confine himself to the facts of the. rec
ords in the decision of a case. He sets
forth that Carter's application for bail
is supported by affidavits of physicians to
the effect that the prisoner's health is im
paired and this, Mr. Richards says, is not
only entirely outside the record but is
false. â
Mr. Richards also declares that Car
ter's counsel went outside the record in
the appeal case in averring that
Carter is an Innocent man and wants
to be released in order to be tried in the
criminal case in Georgia. He adds that to
demonstrate the falsity of this last state
ment it was necessary for the Solicitor
General to state what the Government has
donfe in prosecuting the indictment against
Carter and others in the Federal courts
of Georgia- He continues:
Government's Attitude Is
Denned in Vigorous
Language.

poses Captain Car
ter's Motion.

, A Chicago woman, described by thei papers "of, that city asa "society leader/' is said to have

It is announced that Cleveland will spend the coming summer in the mountains instead of

Sculptor Simmons, who placed upon the, Logan monument at Washington a tablet misrep

GRUESOME stories come from Bangor of poverty in certain rural districts in Maine. In
Lincoln and Hancock counties the soil is poor and loses its small primal fertility in a few
years, impoverishing the people who have lived upon- it. . / '
A dozen towns in that section have disincorporated through sheer inability to pay the
taxes needed to sustain town government. No manufacturing has been introduced to take
the place of decayed agriculture, and a population is practically perishing in its tracks.
The story is pitiful. It tells of old and once independent farmers, whose lands have run
barren,^nd whose sole resource is to mortgage their poor farms for enough to keep them till
they die. One sturdy fanner, old but proud, whose farm had lost its fertility and ceased to yield a
support for him and his faithful wife, went to the Selectmen and exposed his dire situation/He
was willing to work for wages, but there were none to hire him. He proposed, therefore,
if the town would support him and his wife, he would deed to it his farm and all that was upon it.
"That is all that I can do," he cried. "I would rather kill myself and my poor wife than take a
single meal at the town's expense. We shall not live long and will not need much, and the farm
will make the town whole. Take my offer, or we shall be hungry, and worse may happen
in a month." His offer was accepted. The town took his old farm and gave him and his wife
shelter and food. Â¦Â¦:-_Â¦ ; ' . "
Others have followed his example until the towns find themselves loaded down with use
less farms and taxes increasing.-
It is a pitiful situation. These people are Americansâ our countrymen. There is not upon
them the glamour of far-away India, or the romance of distress in Ireland. These old people,
animated by that splendid spirit which refuses to live"on the bread of charity, are up in the cold
and stony part of the prosy State of Maine. '\- ,
A small part of the tens of thousands sent to relieve alien distress could be delicately ap-.
plied to the comfort of these stout-hearted old veterans, and more could well be spent in procur
ing the emigration, from that region, of their descendants. There is fortune in getting a citizenry
of such blood and purpose as they show. Twenty thousand of that kind in California would
double the wealth of the State in ten years. . .
Such a population should not be left to perish, but should be transplanted to better land
and happier conditions.
The American people have Had their sympathies stirred by the story of the Russian Douk
hobors who settled in Canada and are raising a cry of distress.
It seems that these Russians left the empire of the Czar because they are opposed to war
and the Government would not exempt them from. conscription. But it appears, they have other
less pleasant peculiarities than devotion to peace. They oppose private ownership of land, and
have raised an outcry against the Canadian Government because it compels'them to prove up on
homesteads it gives them for nothing. They. also object to furnishing such vital statistics as births
and deaths. They say, "Does not God know who is born and who dies, and when and where?"
therefore why need Canada be curious about it? â¢
They also abjure marriage, and are communists as to women as well as property.
Now, why should any American prefer such people as that for settlers, and let our own
flesh and blood "cease in Maine for lack of food and shelter?
mlque, "H. M. S. Pinafore" the year fol
lowing. In 1S80 "The Pirates of Penz
ance" was first given, and with the ad
vent and immense success of the, Oscar
Wilde cult parody, "Patience," Mr. Carte
determined to have a theater of his own.
The Savoy Theater, the result of his de
cision, with a seating capacity of 1292, and
the then new electric lighting, was com
pleted In the autumn of 18S1, and opened
with a performance Â°f "Patience" on Oc
tober 10. The new opera-house was .lav
ishly patronized and the other operas of
the Gilbert and Sullivan connection were
written and produced amid the happiest
auspices. Then, in 1889, the unlucky
breach between the three' friends occurred,
and since that time little of importance
has been done by any of them.
It was not only in this managerial con
nection that Mr. Carte's name was known,
however. He built the fine Shaftesbury
Theater in London and successfully pro
duced a number of other operas with tour
ing companies In London and the prov
inces. He was a composer of some merit,
was highly esteemed for his financial in
tegrity and for his efforts in the service
of art as he saw it. Mr. Carte was 56
years old when he died.
An unusually Interesting programme,
selected from the compositions of Edward
Schutt, will be given under the direction
of Alexander Stewart at the next meet
ing (April 24) of the Wednesday Morning
Club, Oakland. It will include the sonata
for piano and violin, op. 26; three piano
solos (Intermezzo, Reverie and pre
lude) ; one movement of the suite for piano
and violin, op. 44; "Serenata," for violin,
op. 52; three songs, op 57, "Alone," "In
Twilight Hour" and "What I Love la
Mine Forever"; and trios for piano, violin
and cello. Walzer, Maerchen, op. 54.
Mrs. Carroll Nicholson will be the vocal

From the Unity Church of Santa Bar
bara comes a worthy programme of an
organ recital given by Gerard Barton, or
ganist of the church. The recital took
place on the last Sunday in March and
was heartily enjoyed by the congregation.
The programme, composed entirely of the
works of M. Guilmant, included the fol
io wins numbers:
"Grand Choeur" (in march form), op. 52;
madrigal, "Chant du Itoi Rene" (La Creche);
Pastorale and Adoration, tuge In D, Elevation,
in A flat, and the second sonata, op. 69.
Jean Gerardy, the 'cello virtuoso, so
well remembered here for his splendid
work at the Ysaye concerts three years
ago, passed through San Francisco tliis
week on his way to Australia, where he
will tour for a three months' season.
Early this year a short season in San
Francisco was planned for the artist, but
the arrangement fell through, and. we
shall now have no chance of hearing him
until the spring of next year. We have
missed much in not hearing this brilliant
young musician. According to the East
ern critics, the three years intervening
between this and bis last American tour
(he has just ended a markedly successful
Eastern season) show a tremendous ad
vance in Gerardy's work. Still one of
the youngest musicians on the concert
platform, he is now one of the foremost
artists of his time. I cannot do better
perhaps than quote one of his Eastern
admirers for certificate of the good things
we may expect on his visit here:
"Among the four or five pre-eminently
great violoncellists of the present day
Gerardy unquestionably is one of the first.
When he was here a few years ago, a boy
of 15, I had occasion to commend his
genius. Without takin? Into considera
tion his age, I then pronounced him an
artist of the first rank. What shall I say
of him now? I might bankrupt myself of
adjectives and yet :iot be able to give
him his proper . share of praise. When
he was here before he was a. boy phenom
enon, a rare prodigy. The music critics
vied with one another In bestowing upon
him the most beautiful eulogiums. They
could not repress their ardor and did not
stint their praise. The roseate prophecies
they made touching this ycung Belgian's
future are finding fulfillment now. At
the present moment there does oiot live
a greater artist than this 'wizard of ths
violoncello.' His art has" broadened,
deepened and matured. What a deep
musical feeling, what a warm tempera
ment, what a fabulous technlc Gerardy
has! What refinement, nassion and mag
netism he possesses! He has fulfilled
prophecyâ more than made good the ex
travagant expectations of his admirers."

AT the end of things comes the
questioning time. At the end of
the century we ask curiously,
"Is life worth living?" or, as the
latest genius puts it, -"la death
worth dying?" at the season's end we ask
ourselves foolish questions as to the
worth-whileriess of art and the like eter
nal conundrums. We seek lazily and in
vain for answer, for answer there Is none;
but the philosopher is ever at hand with
the "Everlasting No." Listen to the
greatest novelist of the age, Tourgenieff,
2S he sums up the worth of life and art
in "Enough" et the end of his wonderful
series of stories and sketches: â¢
"Sternly, remorselessly, fate leads each
of us, and only at the first, absorbed in
details of all sorts. In trifles, In ourselves,
we are not aware j of her harsh hand.
While one can be deceived and has no
shame in lying, one can live and there is
no shame in hoping. Truth, not the full
truth, Â¦ of that. Indeed, we cannot speak,
but even that little we can reach locks up
our llpa at once, ties our hands, leads us
to the No.' Then one way alone Is left
to a man to keep his feet, not to fall to
pieces, not to sink Into the mire of self
fcrgetfulness â¢ â¢ â¢ of 6elf-contempt
âcalmly to turn away from all, to say
'enough!' and folding- impotent arms upon
the empty breast to save the last, soie
honor he can attain to, the dignity of
knowing his own nothingness; that dig
nity at which Pascal hints when calling
a. man a thinking reed he says that if
the whole universe' crushed him, he, that
reed, would be higher than the universe,
because he would know it was crushing
him, and It would know it not. A poor
dignity! A sorry consolation!
"But era there no great conceptions,
no great words of consolation, patriot
ism, right, freedom, humanity, art? Yes,
those words there are, and many men
lhre by them and for them. And yet It
seems to me that If Shakespeare could
be born again he would have no cause
to retract his Hamlet, his Lear. His
searching glance would discover nothing
new in human lifeâ still the same motley
picture â In reality so little complex â
would .enroll before him In Its terrifying
sameness. The same credulity and the
same cruelty, the same lust of blood, of
gold, of filth, the same vulgar pleasures,
the same senseless sufferings In the
namÂ«. ... Why, In the name of the
very came shams that Aristophanes
jeered at 2000 years ago, the same coarse
snares In which the many-headed
beast, the multitude, is caught so easily;
the same workings of power, the same
innateness of falsehoodâ in a word, the
same busy squirrels turning in the same
unchanged wheel.
"But art? . . . beauty? . . , Yes,
these are words of power; they are more
powerful, maybe, than those I have spok
en before. Venus of Milo Is, may be,
more real than Roman law or the prin
ciples of 1789. . . . Art at a given mo
ment Is more powerful, maybe, than na
ture; for In nature Is no symphony of
Beethoven, no picture of Ruysdael, no
poem of Goethe, and only dull-witted pe
dants can yet maintain that art is the
'imitation of nature." But at the end of
all, nature Is Inexorable: she has no need
to hurry, and .sooner or later takes her
own. . . . All that exists in her lap
rises only at the cost of something else,
and must in Its turn yield to something
else. â¢ â¢ â¢ And so, serenely, she hides
In mold the godlike shape of Phidias'
Zeus, and gives the vile worm for food
the priceless verse of Sophokles. . . .

eminence and our curse; each of those
'creators' himself, even he and no other,

Innately something noble, eternal â and

The dramatic school has come to stay,
the Old Actor to the contrary notwith

beginning to utili2e European experience
of the value of these schools as we might
have done fifty years ago, had any one
then been intelligent enough or interested
enough in the drama to perceive IL Mr.
F. H. Sargent sends me from New York
the record of public performances by his
In this same speech Mr. Mansfield said
another thins: so prood and so true that It
deserves the widest possible circulation.
"You cannot succeed on the stage," he
told the students, "without work. You
cannot spend the days in bed and the
nights carousing. More women succeed
on the stage because they are more in
earnest, harder workers, more courageous
and more temperate than the average
man. Nothing hinders a woman on the
stage but plain looks and matrimony."
IN a recent address to the students of
the American Academy of Dramatic
Arts, Mr. Mansfield spoke some
- healthy words upon a subject that
much needs, ventilation, to- wit: The
culpable neglect of many theatrical man
agers' to provide proper accommodations
for those who work on the other side of
the curtain. In the front of the house
everything is lovely, but behind ! Let
Mr. Mansfield testify in his own words;
he is surely an expert witness: "From a
merely material point of view," he said,
"the National Theater might tend to im
prove the condition of the traveling
actor. Perhaps some of the managers or
janitors of theaters might be persuaded
to visit New York, and after examining
the National Theater, with its clean and
comfortable dressing roomsâ its green
room and all its other and proper con
veniences and sanitationâ they might be
shamed into making some beneficial al
teration in the dangerous, disgusting and
odoriferous pig pens that are now con
sidered by them to be good enough for
the use of actors.
"There seems to be some good angel
protecting the actor, for \ often wonder
how frail and delicate women live year
after year to undergo the hardships of
the stage, the draughts, the dirt, the foul
odors, the lack of every health conven
ience, the dreadful water."
That is pretty strong, -but none too
strong, and it is well to say it. The
abuse which Mr. Mansfield excoriates la
one that is particularly hard to remedy,
for those who know most about it and
who suffer most from it are precisely
those who would find it most dangerous
to drag it to light. I have never heard of
but one successful actors' revolt against
managerial unsanitation; that was some
years ago, when the New York Lyceum
Theater Company was booked to play one
night in the old Oakland Theater. On
arriving at their dressing rooms the la
dies and gentlemen of the company found
them in such a horrible dirty and ill
provided condition that they unanimously
refused to use them. Within an hour the
management had scrubbed, disinfected
and carpeted the rooms, provided them
with washstands, soap, water and towels
âin short, transformed them from what
Mr. Mansfield properly terms "pig pens"
into apartments fit for human beings.
The leader in this sanitary reform was
Henry Miller and every actor- who, after
that famous feast of purification, played
in the Oakland Theater had good cause
to rise and call him blessed.
In justice be it said that in most of the
theaters built within the last ten years
better, though often insufficient, attention
is paid to. the comfort of the players. In
too many of the older theaters dirt and
lack of ventilation are still crying evils.
POVERTY IN MAINEf
It is a narrow view of the question to say that this country has made money out of the wars
of others. That is true only as a temporary condition, for it is an ineradicable condition that
gain out of another's loss is not profit, for the loss is finally distributed and pinches both the com
mercial demand and supply. â¢ â¢ ... . , : : -- â¢> . â¢
It is no comfort to rejoin to all this that all the leading nations have sins upon them in
their conduct toward the weak and defenseless. It is a hopeful sign that at last remorse is ap
parent anywhere among the strong. Public opinion in this country and Great Britain should nearly
control the policy of the world. It* can surely, do so in the making of war . and in .the
propagation of the spirit of injustice arid destruction. Then why should it not also lead the
world in a policy of justice and peace? We! think it the duty of the press to present the
economic and moral considerations in favor of peace and the' exorcism of the war spirit that has
run rampant through the world for nearly three years.
Professor Goldwin Smith has taken the most careful means to secure reliable information
of the conduct of part of the Christian allies, and writes the result to the Manchester Guardian.
He traces the spirit of savagery to the influence of the declarations of the Kaiser, and deprecates
such use of imperial power as enables "an. autocrat from his luxurious paiace to launch massacre,
arson, theft, outrage, ruin and famine upon an unoffending people on the other side of the globe."

ried on for killing's sake and property destroyed for the love of destruction."
It is highly creditable to the British conscience, however/that the English people are show
ing signs of revolt caused by the moral aspects of the Chinese situation. The Times has recently
published a letter by Auberon-Herbert giving a- specific account of the barbarities inflicted upon
the Chinese by the Christian allies. Mr. Herbert says: "Wholesale deviltry was in full power dur
ing the march to Peking. For no useful purpose, villages and towns were reduced to heaps'of smold
ering ashes and the country turned into a wilderness. Unoffending men, women, children and babies
From economic considerations she needs peace and construction instead of war and de
struction. From a moral standpoint the need is still greater. Public opinion in this country and
England is at one in regard to. the situation in China. The trade, of that vast empire is suspended
to our great loss. To compel China to tax her people for the payment of the monstrous indem
nities demanded means their progressive impoverishment and the decline of their consum
ing power to the. loss of all the nations that trade with her. It is capable of economic demon
stration that every dollar of an unjust indemnity forced from China will be paid by the people of
the Christian nations in the form of lost profits on commerce. The trade of the world is so unified
that famine and poverty in one of the great nations is surely reflected upon all the other nations.
PAUL* KRUGER was not far out of the way when he said the South African republics
could only be conquered at a cost that would appall the world.
That war has already cost twice the burden imposed by the Crimean struggle, and
the results threaten to seriously impair /England's commercial position. The people are already
restless under the imposition of additional taxes, and the whole economic- system, so â¢ carefully
built up by Cobden and Peel, is tumbling to ruin, and the country has before it the dismal pros
pect of the gravest changes in its whole industrial structure. At the first blush it seems that Eng
land's misfortunes will be for the benefit of American trade. But this is questionable. England
has been.our best customer, and the convulsion that impends there will abridge her purchasing
power, to our loss, and we will have to look for recoupment in our share of the world's trade
which she may lose. In that field, /however, we have to meet German/French and finally Rus
sian competition. So in the last analysis our own material fortunes are greatly impinged upon
the condition of our customer, and it is not to our interest that her consuming: power shall, be
decreased by the evils of war. .

value of good teaching and how careful
they are to secure it for their young peo

comic role in the French classic comedy
and was the original Interpreter of many
of the conceptions of Augler. In his later
years his immense fund of experience was
put at the service of the next generation;
as a teacher in the Conservatoire his in
fluence has been potent in shaping the de
velopment of those who are now the lead

TRYING TO END HIS
LIFE BY STARVATION"
Condemned Murderer of Dorothy Me-
Kee Refuses to Partake of
Food. ,
LOS ANGELES, April 20.â E. V. Meth-
ever, convicted of the murder of Dorothy
McKee, having appealed to the Supreme
Court and been denied a new trial, and
having exhausted every legal resource
save executive clemency, is now endeav
oring to cheat the gallows by starving
himself to death. For three days he has
eaten nothing. Medicine has to be forced
down his throat and he is already begin
ning to show the results of his abstinence.
He has appealed to the Governor, but so
far has received no reply to his appeal
and evidently has abandoned hope.
The crime of which Methever stands
convicted was committed in a fit of jeal
ousy at Long Beach.- Methever is an eld
erly man and married.- His victim was a
young girl. Methever. had endeavored to
force attentions upon her, which she de
clined, and he shot her to death.

HARPOONS LETTERS
* THROUGH A MAIL SLOT
Thief Detected While Attempting to
Bob. the Grass Valley Post
offlcs.
GRASS VALLEY, April 20.â An attempt
to steal letters in the Grass Valley Post
office was nipped in the bud at an early
hbur; this morning. Robert Spaulding,
night clerk at the Holbrooke Hotel, went
across the street to mall some letters,
and when entering the Church-street door
he heard the clattering of retreating foot
steps and the sound of the swinging of
the door on the Main-street side. Spauld
ing ran for an officer and in a few seconds
Watchmen Peterson and Frank were
there.
The only evidence of a robbery, was a
-piece of a lath lying in the letter basket
so that It could be seen through the pa
per slot. The lath had a slit in the end,
and the robber had been trying to har
poon letters with it.
Spaulding, who made the discovery, has
detected three sets of criminals in Grass
Valley within as many weeks. "When Ab
sconder "Dan" Sullivan came here after
looting the San Francisco city treasury
he was immediately recognized by Spauld
ing. The latter was sure from Sullivan's
actions that there was something wrong,
but supposed that he was in hiding to
keep from testifying in the Glaze case.
When The Call arrived the following day,
telling the story of-' Sullivan's defalca
tions, Spaulding immediately reported the
matter, but Sullivan was gone.
In a few days Spaulding saw two sus
picious looking men go up the stairway
of the Cloke building and Boon had officers
on the ground. The officers searched the
building, but found no trace of burglars.
The next day it was discovered that they
had forced a door of an office and escaped
through a back window, all in the space
of two or three minutes.
FORTUNES PAID
FOR OIL LANDS
Two Large Deals Carried
Through, Involving
Thousands.
Proven Aores Bring Owners
Golden Returns in
. the South.
Twenty acres of land in the Kern River
district have been sold for $70,000, or at
tho rate of $3500 per acre. The seller is
the Doheny Oil Company and the buyer
P. V. Schermerhorn of Los Angeles. . The
land is the east half of the south
west quarter of section 29, 28, 23. The
purpose of the sale was to provide funds
for the payment of the debts of the com
pany and the. expenses of drilling. The
land Is described as all proven territory.
In addition to this another big' deal is
reported in oil lands from Los Angeles.
An Eastern syndicate has paid $100,000 for
a tract of the southwest extension of the
local Los Angeles field, which includes 140
acres. In one part of the tract, which
has been sold by the Rommel Company,
are forty-seven acres and on it are three
producing wells, the output of which Is
estimated to be about 100 barrels per day.
On the other portion of the tract, which
was sold by the Rodeo j Company, and
which amounts to ninety-two acres, there
is one drilling well which is in a line witli
the wells that are producing on the Rom
mel tract. The purchasers will organize
a company in Boston to develop oil on a
much larger scale than that of the two
companies Â¦ that have made these sales.
The Eastern syndicate has also secured
by lease a tract of 20,000 acres at Gaviota,
thirty miles east from Santa Barbara.
The last named tract has a water front
age of twenty miles on the coast line.
Providing for Options.
The general plan of the Los Angeles
Stock Exchange, that has been under dis
cussion relative to margin trading, . is
about as follows: It is proposed to trans
act business on three accounts, namely,
seller regular, first account, which is de
liverable only during the month following
that in which the trade is made, and sec
ond account, which is deliverable only
during the second month following that
in which the trade is made. The settling
price for each day is the price of the last
transaction in the various stocks. In case
of no transaction the caller will have the
power to name the price and all traders
will daily pay or collect at the settling
price. The commission is fixed at one
fourth cent a share on originals-contracts
for round trade on account trading.
George Easton rates the production of
the Los Angeles field at about the same
as a year ago. The work in the new ter
ritory has made up the loss in the older
parts of the field. Ha estimates that the
daily product of Los Angeles is about 3500
barrels, which would amount to 540,000 bar
rels in the next six months. There is also
to be counted in something like 60,000 bar
rels in storage in the total, so that there
will be 600,000 barrels, or 100,000 barrels per
month to be disposed of in the ensuing
half year. There are contracts out for
70,000 -barrels per month and that leaves
30,000 barrels per month to be disposed of.
The oil men of Los Angeles are endeavor
ing to ascertain how they can dispose
advantageously of the 30,000 barrels per
month surplus. . . ' . '
The Southern Pacific Company' has
leased to A. M. Brenenfleld, James De
paull and John A. Bunting on a royalty
of one-fourth of the product half of a sec
tion in the.Kern River district. Two wells
must be completed the first year and two
wells each year thereafter. \
Tehachapi started its oil drilling with a
barbecue, and the people must have had
a good time. They had a special train
and 500 persons were present. They were
taken in carriages to see the drill start.
A party of newspaper men recently vis
ited the Gibson oil spring in Colusa Coun
ty They report the estimated present
flow of oil from the spring is about twen
ty-five gallons per hour. Gibson has
bonded his. property and a company has
been formed with . a capital stock of
A company will be organized by F. M.
Reynolds and others to drill for oil in
Inyo County. Â¦
An organization is proposed among the
oil operators along the coast range for
irutual protection against . land-jumpers.
This is the outgrowth of the several con
troversies, one\ of which is between the
Mount Diablo and Superior Sunset com
panies in the Midway district. I
Lost Thirty Thousand.
A Santa Barbara correspondent writes
to the Los Angeles Times that the West
ern Coast Company, which failed after
three wells had been drilled in the Cas
itas Pass country to find oil in . paying
quantities, has expended $30,000 in experi
ments. Ex-Governor Markham and
George H. Coffin were concerned in the
enterprise. No stock was sold, but the
promoters each put in $1000. The first two
wells went down 1635 and 1020 feet re
spectively, with no oil. The third well
went down 1000 feet, with a slight'Show
ing of oil at 300 feet. The oil did not come
in Quantities that would have paid for
pumping. â¢ Â¦ â¢
G. "WV Shepard has reported that he has
discovered oil on the "Warrick ranch, nine
miles north from Fresno and about four
miles from Lanes bridge. y
MANILA, April 20.â Aguinaldo haa been
removed from the Malacanan palace to
a private residence, 66 Bolano street. The
guard placed over him has been modified.'
General MacArthur informed a corre-
Bpondent that the effect of Aguinaldo's
address to the Filipinos would undoubted
ly be beneficial. Aguinaldo composed his
address without assistance. The original
draft was in Tagalog. It was afterwards
translated Into Spanish. It Is believed
Aguinaldo Is sincerely desirous of peace.
He is not anxious to ' visit the United
States, and it is considered best that he
should remain here pending the comple
tion of the work of pacification.
The insurgent prisoners at Olongapo will
be returned to Manila. ' Many prisoners
are released daily in exchange for guns

rendered March 15 at San Francisco de
Malabon, is accomplishing much in secur
ing the surrender of outstanding insur-
Lucban In Samar Malvar in Batangas
and Minlo In Abra Province are still head
ing bands large enough to be troublesome,
but it Is almost certain that these three
leaders will surrender within a month.
The serious charges against General
Cailles have placed him in a different
category, but the fairest investigation
will be offered Cailles in case he sur
renders.
It Is understood ti.at a civil govern
ment will be established soon. The pre
cise date has not been fixed on account of
the administrative difficulties confronting
the commission. It will probably be de
layed until July 1, otherwise the military
are ready.
The trial of the members of the Mando-
Ducat secret society, who are charged
with burying alive Filipinos who were
opposed to the insurrection and the trial
of insurgent agents, has elicited the fact
that in one locality all the local officers,
the parish priest and the president were
the chief offenders. A reign of terror was
secretly inaugurated, and persons refus
ing to contribute to the Insurgent cause
wen buried alive by the direction of the
president. All the details of the conspir
acy has been unearthed, there is abund
ant evidence and it Is probable that all
the ringleaders will be hanged.
Rustan, Fabella, Cosmo and "Webb, who
are implicated In trading operations with
the insurgents, were released to-day on
$10,000 bail. '

REMARKABLE SUCCESS
. Of a New Catarrh. Cure.
A large and constantly Increasing ma-
jority of the American people are catarrh
sufferers.. This is not entirely the result
of our changeable climate, but because
modern investigation has clearly . proven
that many diseases, Â¦/ known by other
names, are really catarrh. Formerly the
name catarrh was applied almost exclu-
sively to the common nasal catarrh, but
the throat, stomach, liver, bladder, kid-
neys , and intestines are subject to ca-
tarrhal diseases as well as the nasal pas-
sages. 7 .Â»
In fact, wherever there Is mucous mem-
brane there is a , feeding ground for ca-
tarrh. \
The usual remedies. Inhalers, eprays,
douches. or powders, have been practically
failures, as far as anything more than
temporary relief was concerned, because
they simply dry up the mucous secretions
without having the remotest effect upon
the blood and liver, which are, the real
sources of catarrhal diseases.
It has been ftnown for some years that
the radical cure of catarrh could. never
come from local applications, but from an
internal remedy, acting on the blood and
expelling the catarrhal poison . from' the
system. " .
A new internal preparation which i has
been on 'the market only a short time has
met with remarkable success as a genu-
ine, radical cure for catarrh. .
It may be found in any drugstore, sold
under the name , of Stuart's Catarrh -Tab-
lets, large, pleasant' tasting lozenges, com-
posed principally of antiseptic Ingredients.
Eucalyptol. Gualacol, Sangulnaria, Hy-
drastln and similar catarrh specifics^ . :â¢
Dr. Ainslee In speaking of the new ca-
tarrh cure says: "I have tried the new ca-
tarrh remedy, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets,
upon thirty or forty .patients with re-
markably satisfactory results. They clear
the head and throat more effectually and
lastingly than any douche or inhaler that
I have ever seen, and- although they are
what is called a patent medicine and sold
by druggists, I do not hesitate to recom-
mend -them, as I know them to be free
from cocaine and opiates, and that even a
little child may use, them with : entire
safety." " v â¢
Any sufferer from nasal catarrh, throat
or bronchial trouble, catarrh of the stom-
ach, liver ' or bladder, - will find Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets remarkably, effective,
pleasant and convenient,, and your drug-
gist will tell- you they are absolutely free
from any injurious drug. . '-Â¦>'

SHIMADA SEKKO. one of the most
celebrated Japanese artists of the
day, is now in California on a six
months' visit. The advent of Mr.
Sekko is of strong interest to
artistic circles. His work represents the
best effort of the classical school of Ja
pan, j the school of Hiroshige, Hokusai,
Utamaro, ! that has so vitally influenced
for the better all the art of the Orient
for the last quarter of a century.
Shimada Sekko is a painter of water,
fish and flowers by preference, and any
thing more extraordinarily clever* than
his fish pictures it would be difficult to
imagine. But he runs the whole gamut
of artistic material as it is used in Japan
with apparently equal ease, and we shall
have opportunity during the coming week
of seeing In one of the local galleries
some examples of this modern Japanese
master's marvelous art. Â¦<
Mr. Sekko's visit to California, is for
the puroose of- studying Western art
methods", 'and before his return to Japan
the artist hopes to visit Paris, Munich,
Rome and all the chief art centers of the
world. In his own country . Sekko has
studied for twenty-nine years â lie is now
34 â beginning his art studies at the age
of "5 with his artist-father. At 10 years,
of age he was painting pictures for sale,
and from 12 to 15 illustrating in Japanese
newspapers. At 16 the youthful genius
painted his first picture for the Royal
Academy of Tokio, the Government exhi-
Music in the Park.

Plans Radical Departure in
State Mineralogist Aubury says that he
will try to make the State Mining Bureau
of practical value to the miners. He ha3
ideas that are original and says he ex
pects to make a radical, change in. the
general character of the bulletins to be
issued from the bureau, In comparison
with what has been done heretofore. In
the first place he will instruct the field
deputies that reports must be made with
out technicalities.
"The information Is intended for the
miners, and not for technical societies,"
said Mr. Aubury yesterday. "What the
people wl ( sh to know is where they can
find gold and other products. In this con
nection I may say that it is my Intention
to have the facts reported concerning the
outlying counties that have not had their
share of mention earlier. There are fine
mineral prospects in the most northern
tier of counties, but the public has not
been informed concerning them by the
Mining Bureau. The mother lode has been
very well -exploited, so far as publicity is
concerned, but I will not lose s'ight of the
fact that there are also other sections
that promise well.".
Mr. Aubury also declared that he would
soon set about getting the facts together
concerning copper and quicksilver in Cali
fornia^ and making them public for the
information of all concerned. Much had
been done for gold and silver, etc. Now
the copper and quicksilver interests,
among others, woulu have bulletins de
voted to them. Any mineral substance
would be considered of sufficient imnor
tance to exploit if found to exist in large
commercial quantities in the State. Build
ing stone was worthy of mention. So
with many other substances.
New Copper Converter.
General Manager "Wright of the Moun
tain Copper Company confirms the report
that a copper converting- plant of large
capacity will be Installed at Keswick and
hereafter the metal will be. refined in
Shasta County instead of New Jersey.
This will be the second converter in the
county. "
The San Luis Obispo Breeze reports that
P. Gillis has brought In some nuggets
from his mine In the Los Banos district,
one of which weighed two pounds and
was very rich. The district is reached
from Cambria. ':
According to the Amador Dispatch. Al
vlnza Hayward is about to put in a large
electrical plant on Dry Creek, just above
the Centennial mine. He intends to di
vert the high pressure system above the
marble quarry on the Oleta road and
carry the water around to Dry Creefti
where he can get a great pressure and
be able to supply the northern part of
Amador County with power. A. J. Crain
tells the Dispatch that he expects to be
gin work soon. The Dispatch also re
ports that a survey, preparatory to the
beginning of active mining by the Con
solidated Jackson Company, is being made
of the Zeila mine, both on the surface
and underground. The survey is being
made with the permission- of the Zeila,
Company, and is made with a view of
determining the exact location of the end
lines of the Zeila and of the Consolidated
Jackson Company's ground, which adjoins
the Zeila on the north. Upon the com
pletion of the survey, w,hich will doubt
less be some time next week, work will
begin on the Fleming property without
further delay.
E&tsnding the Ditches.
The Tuolumne Independent says:
The Yosemite Gold Mining Company, which
owns several hundred acres of gravel mining
land south of the county line in Mariposa, at
what is known as the gravel range, is con
templating extending the ditch from the mine
at Little Gap to the Donohue Diggings.' The
company eets water from the Merced Com
pany's ditch, the water for which is taken
out of the south fork of the Tuolumne. Last
year the ditch was completed down as far as
the gravel range, and about a month ago
a slide occurred at the flume, stopping opera
tions at the Yosemite mine. ...
Facts from Siskiyou County mines are
gathered from the Yreka Journal, which
says:
A. C. Brokaw is now rushing work in the
old Campbell hydraulic mine at Quartz Valley,
with prospects of the best season for many
years, by reason of the great abundance of
water available. He has made the ditches
larger with an additional supply from recent
connection with a good sized lake on the Sal
mon range, to Insure a longer run of water.
There is also another lake fifty feet higher up
the mountain he may likely connect in the
future, which would afford an almost perpet
ual supply of water, when not blocked by ice
and snow in midwinter. AH the Scott Valley
diggings at Oro Flno, Mugginsville. Patterson
Creek, Pinery. McAdams i Creek and Indian
Creek and other creeks and gulches, will be
worked on a larger scale than usual, by rea
son of ,the prospects of a longer run of water
than for many years, on account of the great
quantity of rain and snow since New Year's
The Spengler Brothers, at the mouth of Hum
bug Creek, are â¢ putting in full time ground
sluicing the banks and washing up, bedrock
gravel in sluices with good success. \
Mining: an Orchard.
The Stowell copper mine in Shasta Coun
ty, so says the Redding Free Press, may
soon change owners and go to parties who
will continue to develop the property. The
administratrix of the estate of John
Stowell has filed a petition for sale. There
are nine claims which have been ap
praised at $65,000 recently. Stowell val
ued the mines T.t $120,000.
The fruit ranch of John H. Leggett, so
says the Chlco Record, has been- leased
to "W. P. Hammon and others to be work
ed in dredger mining. This ranch, of
about 160 acres, lies along the Feather
River, just above Oroville, in the center
of a little valley. It has long been known
as one of the most productive in the
county, being planted to vines and fruit.
The place has paid Â¦ Mr. Leggett from
$15,000 to $20,000 during the last few years.
The greater part of the ranch has never
been worked as a mine. The terms of
the lease are that Legrgett shall receive
one-half of the proceeds and that time
of duration of the agreement shall be
thirty years. . .
A propecting party has been organized
at Los Angeles to explore Inyo County
and in the Providence Mountains , of
southwestern Nevada for valuable met
als. Traveling with a cook and a team
ster, the party, which embraces practi-.
cal miners and assayers, will start with
an equipment that will enable them to
stay in the field for months at a time.
A start was recently made, going down
the Antelope Valley with the intention of
crossing Cajon Pass and going to Barstow
'en route for Death Valley. . Future opera
tions will depend upon what ledges they
encounter.
The Stockton Independent gives the
following account of the troubles of the
Stockton Gravel Mining Company, which
operates the Philadelphia diggings In
Tuolumne County: * ,
Frank J. Schoettcen has begun suit In Tu
olumne County In the Superior Court for dam
ages for digging up the boU and. for running
water over the land. The mining company
owns about 600 acres of placer diggings fifteen
miles from Columbia. This land had laid idle
for many years until the Stockton company
took hold,' and through their energetic and
untiring efforts the foundation for a great and
permanent Industry has been established. The
company found the mine rich in magnificent
posslblltles, but reauirlng the expenditure of
vast sums of money and no end of labor and
time before any return whatever could be ex
pected for their outlay. Undaunted, however,
and with commendable grit, they set to work.
Miles of ditch were dug, roads built and
flumes constructed. A tunnel several hundred
feet lonir Â« - as run through adamantine rock,
costing $25 per foot, to tap the channel at its
lowest point. -Dollars were spent by the thou
sand, giving employment to hundreds of men
and proving of inestimable benefit to that sec
tion, and. in fact, >. to the entire county. The
company had Just commenced to enjoy the
fruits of their labors, ! hydraulicklng being in
progress day and night, when through Frank
J. Schoettgen an Injunction was Issued stop
ping the flow of ..water Â¦ through the ditch,
shutting down the mine and : throwing atx.-ut
fifty men out of employment, and he asks thtt
the' shut down be made ptipetual. Â¦Â¦ / Â¦ --Â¦Â¦

Of all the regiments arriving from the
Philippines none has won a more enviable
record than the Twenty-ninth Infantry,
TJ. S. V.. which arrived Friday on the
transport Grant. The regiment has been
full of business since it went to the isl
ands In the fall of 1899. and its officers
point with pardonable pride to its splendid
record of hard fighting that dates almost
from the time it landed at Manila.
Accordingto the army records the Twen
ty-ninth holds an enviable record, and
has been highly commended to the au
thorities at Washington for its useful and
arduous services. Standing third on the
list of all military organizations that
have explored the Philippine jungles in
eea-rch of the wily Agulnaldo and his co
horts, in the number of engagements
fought, the capture of arms and ammuni
tion, commissary stores, papers, and the
bagging of the greatest number of im
portant prisoners, the Twenty-ninth will
doubtless be missed before the finishing
touches are put on the conflict.
The regiment was recruited at Fort Mc-
Pherson. Georgia, in July, 1899, and in
cludes many men who fought in Cuba
the year before. A majority of the sol
diers are natives of Georgia and Louis
iana. Many of them are representatives
of the proudest Southern families, whose
fathers followed the banners of Lee and
Jackson and bled for the "Lost Cause."
During its preparation for active service
the Twenty-ninth Infantry attracted gen
eral notice by its excellent marksmanship
on the rifles ranges. Once arrived in the
Philippines the trained eyes and hands
that had been accustomed to bringing
down the nimble squirrels of the Georgia
woods quickly fell Into the practice of
winging yellow natives.
Served Under Lawton.
Two battalions were sent on the City
of Para under command of Colonel E.
Hardin, and the remainder of the regi
ment., commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Sargent, remained for a time on board
the transport Zealandia. On November 5,
1899, the Twenty-ninth got its first taste
of flghting near Caloocan. Company A,
commanded by Captain James ' A
Rash. en route from that place
to Malabon, got Into a hot skir
mish with the enemy, and quickly
drove them off with considerable loss to
the Filipinos. On December 18. the regi
ment was ordered to La Lama. It marched
through a driving rain storm, and was
attached to General Lawton's command
then advancing on San Mateo. The his
tory of this battle, in which the gallant
Lavrton lost his life in the attack on the
rebel town, is well known. Ten minutes
before General Lawton received his fatal
wound he remarked to Lieutenant Colonel
Sargent as the Twenty-ninth moved into
action. "That is the finest formation for
an attack I have ever reen." A private
or Company E of the regiment was acting
as General Lawton's orderly, and It was
he who carried to Lieutenant Colonel Sar
gent the general's last order.
It did not take long for the news of
General Lawton's death to reach every
corner of Luzon, and the army was cast
down by sorrow. After San Mateo was
taken the Twenty-ninth did hard service
for months. Private Hewitt of Company
G, while acting as Major Hawthrone's
orderly, was captured and nothing more
has ever been heard of the unfortunate
prisoner. The following day Private Mar
shall of Captain Rash's command distin
guished himself by killing an insurgent
captain, the first officer to fall under the
deadly aim of the Twenty-ninth, already
destined to play such havoc in the rebel
ranks.
After a prolonged and exhaustinsr cam
paign in the field the regiment, on Feb
ruary 26, was ordered to Manila and occu
pied the old Spanish Nlpa barracks,
known as Paco. Later the regiment saw
active service in Albay. In an engage
ment on the island of Marinduque Cap
tain Rash had his right hand shattered
and lost a thumb and finger, while Ser
geant James Ellis, who was about to re
ceive a lieutenancy for meritorious con
duct In the Cuban campaign, 1 was serious
ly shot in the shoulder. Throughout the
regiment's service in the Philippines it
was kept on the go, and fought from
Northern Luzon to the southern Islands

Daughter of the Regiment.
An Interesting feature of the Twenty
ninth s career In the islands was the pres
ence of a woman, who for a time followed
It through its many campaigns and acted
as a sojt of mascot to the regiment When
about to enter Manila Bay a young wo
man journalist. Miss J. B. Beam, who had
shipped in disguise as a cabin-boy, made
her identity known. The captain-quarter
master was intent upon turning her over
to the authorities despite the protests and
pleadings of the other officers. Miss Beam
was finally smuggled from the ship and
became a daughter of the regiment until
her health broke down and she returned
to America-
The Twenty-ninth was accompanied

GRAND RECORD OF TWENTY-NINTH
THROUGHOUT PHILIPPINE CAMPAIGN
Â¦ Volunteers Â¦whose "time has expired _ are
still arriving from Manila," while men to
take their places are being .sent out.., -The
long looked for transport Garonne arrived
yesterday, while the Thomas &ot" away
late in the afternoon. -
The Garonne brought up eleven compa
nies of the Twenty-sixth Infantry, 'while
the Thomas took away over 300 Marine
Corps men and casuals. .Many of the lat
ter are colored men, and as the transport
was delayed in sailing they were allowed
to eo ashore. One and all proceeded to
get drunk and then they began , to run
the saloons. An urgency call was turned
into the Harbor police station and Ser
geant Shaw and a detail of eight men
were sent to the scene in the patrol wag
on. They soon quelled the disturbance
and rushed, the rioters back . aboard the
ship, where they were detained. â¢ The
Thomas" took away six officers -and 150
men of the United States Marine Corps,'
seven members of the Hospital Corps and
150 casuals. The, cabin passengers were:
Major S. W. Fountain of the adjutant
general's department â¢ and family, Mrs.
Pickering, wife of Captain Abner Picker
ing, Second Infantry; Mrs. McCook, wife
of Lieutenant Paul H. McCook, Second,
Infantry, Mrs. Marquardt, wife of Lieu

McFarland, Eighteenth Infantry; Mrs.
Byram, wife of Captain Byram, Sixth
Cavalry; Mrs. Bennet, wife of Captain J.
B. Bennet, Sixteenth Infantry; Dr. Pursell
and' Â¦wife, Professor Brink and wife and
Miss Florence Ashmore, a teacher. '
The Garonne is the- banner stowaway
ship of the transport fleet. She brings
sixty-four of this class of passengers, but
how they are going to land here is the
question. The Government does not want
the vessel any longer, and in two days she
will leave for Seattle. Neither does the
Government want the stowaways nor will
it land them. In consequence the three
score and four will continue on to Seattle
unless they car. manage to get ashore by
their own efforts. I The Garonne will not
dock while in this port. Â¦ . ' Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦
The Garonne brought home thirty-nine
officers and 843 men of the Twenty-sixth
Infantry, five prisoners, six hospital corps,
ten discharged soldiers and seven civil
ians. Colonel Rice old not come home

Prof. Turner, President of Fairmount College,

of new hair. The whole of my hair was gone

Â¦weeks the bald spot was entirely covered, not-
withstanding; that when I commenced using
the remedy I had a diseased scalp. I had

MISS EDITH WILLIAMS
"Yes, father, is a reformed man,", she said,
"and our friends . think It a miracle that I
cured him < without his knowledge or consent.
I had read how Mrs. Â¦ Kate Lynch of 829 Ellis
street, San Francisco, Cal., had cured her hus-
band by using a remedy secretly in his coffee
and food and I wrote to Dr. Halnes for a trial.
When it came I put some in father's coffee
and food and watched him closely, but he
couldn't tell the difference so I kept It up.
"One morning father got up and said he was
hungry. This was a good sign, aa he rarely
ate much breakfast. He went away and when
he came home at noon perfectly sober I was
almost frantic with joy, as I hadn't seen him
sober for half a day before In over fourteen
years. After dinner he sat down In the big
easy chair and said, "Edith, -I don'* know
what has come over me but I . hate the sight
and smell cf liquor and am going to stop
drinking forever.' This was too much for me
and I told him then what I had. done. WelL
we both had a good cry and now we have the
happiest home and the kindest father you can
imagine. I am so glad you will publish this
experience, for it will. reach many others and
let them know abQUt that wonderful Golden
Specific." ' .
Dr. Halnes, the aiscoverer, will' send a sam-
ple of this grand remedy free to all who will
write for it. Enough of the remedy is mailed
free to Bhow how It Is used in tea, coffee or
food, and that it will cure the dreaded habit
quietly and permanently. â¢ Send your name and
address to Dr. J. W. Halnes, 1098 Glenn build-
ing, Cincinnati. Ohio, and he will mail a free
sample of the remedy to you, securely sealed
In a plain wrapper, also full directions . how
to use it, books and . testimonials from hun-

The run-down of the 112-dog reserve
stake at Union Park yesterday brought
out many good coursers. The day's sport
in general was a programme of fine trials.
Of late and quite frequently, too. the
wise ones and the quiet piker, as well have
racked their heads for reasons to explain
the defeat of a hardened campaigner by
some stripling when the favorite was at
almost prohibitive odds. The unlooked-for
result would be charged to coursing luck
until the young performer would in anoth
er stake demonstrate its ability to travel
with the fast ones. Game Boy's ' recent
great work in reaching second place
among a Held of good ones and the clever
going of other young dogs has hinted
that the warriors of the coursing field
must look well to their laurels to compete
successfully with the high-class youthful
aspirants for stake honors.
The dope figurers were badly punished
In the second course of. the run-down for
holding too lightly the For Freedom-May
flower sapling, Black Head, a litter broth
er of Game Boy, in his course with King
Cotton. Curtis' more experienced young
hound is admittedly a courser of class,
but, considering the running and clever
ness of the Star Kennels' entry during his
short time at the game, the talent erred
in placing him on the short end of a 6 to
1 price. Black Head won the go by a
score of 5 to 1 and, though he was the re
cipient of what favor was bestowed, still
a victory over a performer of King Cot
ton's standing Is certainly one worth hav
ing.

Emlle Robin Wrecks Life of Mother
: and Removes Daughter From â¢
Rescuing 1 Sands.
Myrtle Randall, a girl 16 years of age,
who was about to be saved from. a life
of infamy by the California Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
has been spirited away to Sacramento by
the unprincipled seducer of her mother.
Myrtle Randall came to this city from
Missouri with her father, and mother and
her brother -"Willie' several years ago. A
short time after their arrival Mrs. Ran
dall left home with a Frenchman named
Robin, taking her two children with her.
The pair drifted about the State for a
year or two and finally located in Sacra
mento. *
Meanwhile Mr. Randall died and a few
years later his former wife, repenting on
her deathbed of her - misdoings, sum
moned her mother, Mrs. Smith, and deliv
ered to her care the two children of Mr.
Randall and a boy, Frankie. who was a
son of, Robin. Mrs. Smith* took the two
older children to her . own home and
turned Frankie over to Robin's relatives,
who live at 717 San Jose avenue. Robin
constantly tried to make the Randall
children dissatisfied and at last induced
Myrtle to leave home and go to live at his
relatives' house.
The case was reported to the charitable
society and Secretary White and Officer
McMurray, having been granted letters
of guardianship by the Superior Court â¢ for
both "Willie and Myrtle, went to the Rob
in home to take Myrtle, but on arriving
there learned that Robin had induced tho
girl to leave for Sacramento. The offi
cials of the society in that place have
been notified and the girl will be held if
found. ? t *
The house at 717. San Jose avenue,
where Frankie and Myrtle have been liv
ing, is; filthy beyond description. Twelve
people sleep- in three small, illy lighted
rooms. The matter has been reported to
the Board of Health. â¢ . -

Judge Fritz's court - and Sullivan was
booked on the charge. His bonds were
fixed at $5000. Â¦ -^ -
The two Indictments found by the Grand
Jury were both for forging the name of
Judge Mogan to orders for the return of
bail money. I One. was for the Foster case,
for which Judge Mogan swore to the war
rant yesterday, and the other was In the
case of J. C. "Wilson, who was released
on a charge of vagrancy in $50 bail, and
the money was withdrawn by Sullivan on
a forged order. It will not be necessary
to draw up an indictment in the Foster
case, as the warrant has already been
executed. â¢'---â¢Â¦"Â¦...,Â¦:.:
-Â¦ Assistant District Attorney "Weller, who
is acting for I the District Attorney I in the

Judge Mogan to swear to a complaint for
Sullivan's arrest on the charge of forging
his name , to "the . order, for ; the : return : of,
$50 .bail money -in the case of Jennie Fos

The J Judge - swore to the : complaint in
"From the 'testimony presented at the
last hearing I am satisfied that the crime
of forgery cannot be proved within the
purview of section 470 of the. Penal Code.
For that reason' I discharge the defend
ant.*' ..-.''."Â¦ - f : : . .
The evidence : referred ' to . by the Judge
was that "of J. O. Reis, cashier in the
Treasurer's office, who testified that he
did not * consider the indorsement on an
order essential; and that he only looked to

On March 11 $250 ball was deposited in the
treasury to the credit of Sylvain. On March
14. an order, purporting to be drawn by Judge
Conlan, was paid In, Deputy Perkins states,
as part of the Â¦ daily deposit of the warrant
clerk (he having- cashed the order for $250 as
an accommodation). On March 20, the prisoner
having been fined $250, another order was pre
sented for this amount by the County Clerk,
which was also cashed and placed to the credit
of fines account. As the last order is claimed
to be 'the original the matter rests between

The case of "W. Sylvaln is also net regular. ;
In the warrant clerk" s * account Â¦ ' with ' the
Treasurer In this court ..I have .not found
many irregularities, but note the following:
Some Irregularities Noted.
H There is . another . matter that requires atten
tion. I found that bails deposited in cases *of
drunkenness were seldom, If ever, forfeited;
they were .almost '. invariably â¢ dismissed on the
calendar and -Â¦ :ballbobk. â¢ On comparing : the
Judge's, book with 'the calendars I- found that
according- ; to '-his- record > some had been' for
feited. .- On .going through . the list, however,
with Judge 'Cpnlan; he remembered that some
had been ;"set aside" .afterwards .and others
he was not certain about. He selected a few
and- these fines the clerk has paid into the
treasury, protesting, however, that his record
of dismissals in the calendars was correct. ' It
is a matter. .between the Judge and the clerk;
there are some still unsettled and the Judge
has i ordered the - clerk to subpena the per
sons who signed receipts for the bail. If they
can be ' found, and ascertain what was done
in the cases. These last cases occurred before
the ballbooks came into possession" of the clerk
of the' court Â¦ and few of the dismissals . are in
his handwriting. . ..,.'. 'â.'.-.. . â¢
.The" proper way - to report on Â¦ the warrant
clerk's books would be to compare all the
prison discharges with the bailbooks, and 'then
compare 'the latter "* with the .Treasurer's
books to see if all receipts had been deposited.
I consider the whole matter the. result of
laxity ; and carelessness .on the I part of the
clerk, and nothing else. . . . Â¦ . â¢/''â¢Â¦'<'
Clerk Bice Was Careless.
' In his report Expert "Williams says 'he
examined the . accounts I from j January 1,
1900, to March 31, 1901, by comparing the
! cash books. with the court calendars, bail
books and Treasurer's books. His report
says: . ;Â¦_ . Â¦Â¦_-. * ;â¢â¢â¢':.â¢Â¥ .". .;-..,
I. find an apparent deficiency of $413.'. Part
of .this amount, < however, consists of fines
which are ;in the treasury to the credit of the
bail accounts and have' not been transferred.
I wi'.i have orders drawn on the treasury -for
the amount ($175),. signed by the Judge,, entered
in the cashbook and paid in to the credit ' of
fines. Another credit of $38 consists of lines
paid in the County Jail, Â¦ for which the cleric
signed receipts, although he never received the
money. It was almost accidentally found to
be in the Sheriff's hands and had been paid
into the treasury as part of his receipts. Â¦ For
the balance ($200) I made demand on- the clerk
and . he has duly paid the money Into the
treasury. -'--'Â¦--,. < , .

was not short *in -his accounts. :
Mayor Phelan's suggestion was made at
a meeting called by the Mayor yesterday
afternoon: \ After Expert Williams had
concluded the â¢ reading- of his report the
Mayor, intimated that Rice should" be dis
charged. County Clerk Deane declined
to entertain the proposition. Mr. Deane
also expressed the opinion. that when the
tangle is finally straightened out it will be
found that there is money coming from,
the city to Rice instead of from Rice to
the city. >-1 â¢' Â£-"; : Â£ v ;. : l^-Jl
C. B. Perkins of the Treasurer's office,
Chief of Police Sullivan and the Mayor's
attorney, Daniel Â¦ Murphy, were appointed
a committee to report to the Auditor, and
Mayor a plan by which bail money paid
into 'the treasury may bewithdrawn,--and
suggest an j ordinance for ' this . purpose to
be; adopted by the Supervisors. A report
will be made next Monday arid a large
amount' of bail money now tied up in. the
treasury will then be paid to the parties
rightfully claiming- ;the same. .- . .
As a result of a report made by Expert
."Williams regarding the bail bond irregu
larities in Police Court No. 2, Mayor Phe
lan yesterday suggested to County Clerk
Deane that if John P. Rice, the clerk of
the court. | was in his employ : he would
consider it his" duty , to discharge him.
County Clerk Deane responded that if he
believed Rice was guilty of any wrongful
act he would feel it his duty to discharge
him, but stated that after an Investigation
he had decided that Rice was in no sense
to blame, as the errors originated in the
warrant and bondclerk's office, and Rice

WKIT TO RELEASE THILOW
Son-in-I*aw Eaton Takes Steps to

Habeas corpus proceedings to secure
the release from the insane asylum of

judge Lawlor and - procured -a writ. -
Later in the day he left for Napa to per- '
sonally supervise Its service and return
to the city with the alleged insane man.
Family differences are alleged to have
been the cause of -Thilow's arrest. All
who have had busines.5 dealings with him
admit that he was cranky, but declare
that he never gave such evidence of fail
ing mind as would lead to his restraint in
an asylum. A bitter fight Is expected, as
Tailor is said to be possessed of some
property.
Easton, who applied for the writ, is a
son of the treasurer of the local tele
phone company. He married a daughter
of Thilow's first wife. The latter has
married again and Is now residing In
Berkeley. Thilow's present wife, whom,
he married about eight years ago. Is con

. Charles Smith, an employe of the Mu

knocked senseless by a live wire at the
top of a pole in front of the ferry build
ing last evening. As he was about to
plunge to the pavement below, his belt
caught on one of the hooks In the pole
and he remained suspended in the air
and unconscious in the sight of thousands
of people until secured by a rope and
lowered to the ground. He recovered
later In the Harbor Hospital.
Smith was in the act of repairing: a
lamp connection when he came in contact
with the live wire. It was just at a time
when the crowds were hastening to catch
an Oakland bound boat and hundreds of
people heard his cry and -saw him plunge
forward. All expected to see the unfor
tunate lineman strike the pavement, but
he. had descended scarcely more than two
feet when his belt caught on a hook
driven in a pole and he stopped Â¦ in his
downward flight.
Smith hung there, apparently dead, until
a. line was fastened to his body and he
was lowered to the ground. Life was
found to still exist and the Harbor Hos
pital physicians succeeded in restoring
the man to consciousness after an hour's
work. Smith was badly burned about the
hands. He was later removed to his
home, 302 Sutter street.

United States Marshal Shine, with six
Deputy Marshals and ten attaches
of the Chinese Bureau, under Dr.
Gardner, made a sudden descent
en Chinatown yesterday afternoon
and, amid scenes of intense excite
ment, chopped .their way with axes Into
the slave brothels and took into custody
more than a score and a half of shrieking.
terrified females, who knew not and could
rot be made to understand what It all
meant. Half of those caught in the drag
ret were later released, but the officers
v.-ene compelled to work quickly and they
gathered In every woman and girl found
in the disreputable places, to be held until
the sifting process that came afterward
should determine which of the prisoners
were entitled to eo free. â¢
The raid was the immediate result of
orders received from the Attorney Gen
eral at Washington by United States Dis
trict Attorney Woodworth, directing him
to do all in his power to suppress the
traific In female Chinese slaves In this
city. It was the most exciting raid, as it
was tha most unexpected, that ever oc
curred in the Chinese quarter and created
consternation among the Mongolian slave
owners.
At exactly 4 o'clock the raiders, in 'citi
zens' clothes, came down Jackson street
from Stockton and turned into Sullivan
alley. Immediately their axes were cutting
at the doors of the brothels and the terri
fied shrieking and screaming, were'
draped from their berths.
The Chinese were taken completely by
purprlse. They scarcely realized what was
happening until wholesale arrests were be
;r:g made. The body of officers marching*
into the alley did not attract the attention
it would have at any other time, as the
work of renovating the bouses by the
Board of Health was going on and. the
streets were packed with Mongolians and
loiterers, who had gathered to watch the
cleansing operations. .
Alarm Quickly Sounded.
After Marshal Shine and his deputies
had etruck the first blow the alarm was
quickly sounded by the keepers of the
houses. Immediately Chinatown became
a. ecene of -wild commotion. Women shout
*>d from windows, while others hastened
to bar the doors against the invaders. As
quickly as the doors splintered under the
heavy blows and the girls were made pris
oners the scene of activity extended to the
street as the arresting officers carried the
struggling girls to a location selected for
their reception.
The cries of the frightened females at
tracted grreat attention and crowds
swarmed In through the gates of the for
bidden territory. The owners of the
houses rushed to the front to enter their
protests. Then came Mongolians, who
claimed xromen as their wives as they
were brought down the narrow stair
ways. None seemed to comprehend the
meaning of the proceedings and terror
struck the hearts of the denizens as they
were seized and hustled Into the street.
The escapes were numerous. It is esti
mated that at least eighty women, in
mates of houses on Baker court and Sul
livan alley, availed themselves of the op
portunities presented by back alleys and
roofe to elude their pursuers. These wo
men were soon scattered throughout the
entire quarter and their identity as slave
irlrls was soon lost. Many of them
climbed to the roofs of adjacent build
ings and watched the commotion in the
streets below until the raiders had fin
ished their work and departed with the
last of their prisoners.
Make a Big Haul.
In the course of a few moments "every
brothel was emptied of its occupants.
Nearly 150 rooms were visited, but with
the exception of those entered during the
first few moments of the rail, they were
deserted and the occupants had flown.
"When the work of raiding ceased Mar
shall Shine had just thirty-four prisoners.
Dr. Gardner and Interr>reters Da Silva
and Rickards then began the examina
tions. Sixteen girls produced either court
papers or certificates and were released
The other eighteen were held In custody,
'i'he efforts of the Mongolians to save
the women from being taken away were
interesting. Certificates by the handful
were presented and some of tha females
were each claimed by as many as a dozen
men as their wives. â¢ The officials were
too shrewd for the wily Mongolians, how
ever, and enly those who had a right to
go were liberated.
Last night the brothels were in dark
ress. but excitement styi reigned in the
Chinese quarter. The women who man
aged to escape the raiding: party kept
under cover and it is said that they will
not risk returning- to their -old quarters
for some time.
In the raiding party under Marshal
Shine were Deputies Farish, De Lancie.
Buraham. Gambol, Bellas' and Morse.

BOARD WILL
REDUCE SIZE
OF CLASSES
School Directors Agree
to Limit Each to
Fifty Pupils.
More Teachera Must Be. Ap
pointed When Plan Is:
Adopted.
Denman Alone Stands in Opposition,
Still Claiming Tnat Sixty Chil
dren Should Be Minimum.
The Board of Education has decided,
that Its present classification requiring an
attendance of flfty-five pupils In tha pri
mary classes is too high and steps will in
all likelihood be taken to reduce that
number to fifty, to go into effect at tha
beginning of the next school term. The
higher classification Inaugurated by the
board has all along been steadily opposed
by Superintendent of Schools "Webster,
who Has contended that fifty pupils in ona
class, would result In better work and
more satisfactory progress. Director*
Kincaid, Mark and Casserly have finally
come to the conclusion that "Webster is
right and a lower classification will be in
augurated.
Director Denman stands alone In his
contention that where there are sixty in
a class the pupils achieve better results.
It is not thought likely that Denman will
agree to support his colleagues in adopt
ing a rule limiting the number of pupils
to fifty in a class. In this connection it is
interesting to" note Denman's change of
opinion to that entertained by him in 1S75.
when he was Superintendent of Schools.
In his report of that year, filed with the
Board of Education, Denman Incorporated
the report of his deputy. Joseph ilejrgett.
who under the caption "Too Many Puplla
Assigned to a Teacher" says:-
I have no reason to chance or modify, my
views on this subject during the past year. I
would reiterate my opinion as expressed In my
last report that not more than forty grammar
pupils nor more than fifty primary pupils ought
to be assigned to any one teacher.
The foregoing was submitted to the then,
Superintendent Desman, who in his re
port to the Board of Education saya:
I herewith present the report of the Deputy
Superintendent and auk you to carefully con
sider his suggestions and recommendations.
Denman may, however, submit to an
other change of opinion and may ulti
mately fall In line with his colleagues in
effecting the lower classification. It is a
fact that some classes are overcrowded
with fifty-rive pupils, as often there are
not sufficient accommodations for them.
The practical result of lessening the
number of pupils in each class will be the
employment of at least twenty-five addi
tional teachers. If the Auditor's recom
mendation that $37,000 additional to tha
amount set aside last year for teachers'
salaries be accepted by the Supervisors
the Board of Education will see its way
clear to lower the classification and em
ploy more teachers. In that event the
teachers about to be displaced by others
who will return from long leaves of ab
sence will all be taken care of.

Emma Grassmann filed suit against
Frederick Grassmann yesterday for di

Mrs. Grassmann says her husband, who
is a baker, frequently threw her across
the room and otherwise abused her.
LONDON, April 20.â War and politics
have taken a back seat for the day
throughout the United Kingdom, where
the sole absorbing topic of national im
portance Is the great football match â¢ at
Crystal Palace /or the possession of the
association cup. The Sheffield United and
the Tottenham Hotspurs were the two
teams competing in the final.
Sheffield won the toss, kicked off
promptly at 3:30 p. m., and after eleven
minutes' warm play; scored the first goal.
Shortly afterward the Hotspurs were
awarded a free kick for a foul, . which
evened matters. The result was a draw,
two all. * . * -.' ..'.
ENGLISH FOOTBAIiL .
GAME ENDS IN" A TIE
. A tremendous cheer greeted little Cado
gan and McCaughern as they toed the
mark in the opening event, the 100-yard
dash. Both men were sent off by Starter
Pnil Wand and they sped toward the tape
as on the wingrs of the wind. Cadogan
showed his superiority as a sprinter and
won easily. When Brown beat Hamilton
out by a narrow margin in the next heat
the California rooters yelled with Joy.
The final heat was run fifteen minutes
The Ball Opens.
California seemed to be invincible.
Whether it was familiarity with the track,
condition or better men Is a mooted ques
tion, but at all events all three helped
California win the day.
greatest ever achieved by the California
track team. . . '; .-.â¢'.
The day was ideal for record breaking.
Not a breath of air was stirring, yet the
atmosphere was balmy and invigorating.
The cinder path was springy and in fine
shape. Coupled with these important es
sentials, it was the annual field day of
the two institutions of learning and the
partisans of both were there in large num
bers to root for their respective repre
sentatives. The University of California
naturally had the largest aggregation in
the grounds and the noise generated by
the rooters under the leadership of Ring
leader Schwartz could be heard in Oak
land. The blue and gold students and
their band occupied the baseball bleachers
that were set up inside the grounds for
the occasion. Stanford's rooters were on
the opposite side of the field, and between
events repartee and badinage flew back
and forth like a game of shuttle-cock.
Few chances were given Stanford to
awake from a deep lethargy â once when
Zschokke won the mile walk and again
when one of the team distinguished him
self by a first place. It is true that the
Stanford . team was cheered to the echo,
j but seldom was the cardinal slogan heard
! in acclaim for a victory.

STANFORD'S fondest hopes and
seven coast records took an air
ship flight at the ninth annual in
tercollegiate field day held yester
day on the University of Califor
nia's campus at Berkeley. It was a sad
day for the Palo Alto students, but they
bore their defeat like, true martyrs. The
victory gained by California wasan over
whelming one and will be recorded in the
annals of college history as one. of the
The 120-yard hurdle race brought forth
the only accident of the day.- Narramore,
Stanford's clever sprinter, had negotiated
all but one of the high hurdles and was
giving Powell a hard fight for first place,
later and Cadogan was aÂ± : Jiis best. - He
breasted the tape with a wonderful spurt
of speed and four watches clicked 10 sec
onds flat in unison and the announcer in
formed the assemblage that the victor
had lowered the intercollegiate record and
equaled the time made by Haley of thÂ»
Olympic Club in 1880.
Terry McGovern, accompanied by his
â¢wife and baby boy, were spectators at the
track. Terry was followed by an admir
ing crowd during his perambulations
through the ring, but he received no in
vitations to don the mits. Terry is some
what of a plunger when he gets the right
tip.
Sam Hildreth, while beaten for the gen
tleman riders' race on Friday, earned con
siderable fame. Yesterday Sam received
a telegTam from Willie Spencer, now a
New Yorker, asking If he would accept
the mount on Maximo Gomez in the
Brooklyn handicap. A few minutes later
this was followed by another wire from
Fj-ed Berulew offering Sam the mount on
Jack Demond in the Stallion stakes. Both
telegrams were sent collect.
Fifteen books cut in and the play was
reported better than for some days.
Thomas H. Williams Jr., president of
the New California Jockey Club, viewed
\he sport from the judges' stand.
Announcer Bob MeGibben received a
mild ovation on his reappearance in har
ness.
Charley Thorpe will leave for his home
in Nebraska, to-night. The veteran rider
is undecided as to whether he will make
the European trip. Sam Hildreth made
Charley an offer some weeks ago to ride
on the Chicago tracks and he may ac
cept it.
Starter Jake Holtman has wired his
resignation to the Fair Grounds and Del
mar associations, St. L>ouis. Dick Dwyer,
now in Chicago, has taken a like action,
as neither flag-wielder wishes to be out
lawed by the Western Jockey Club.
No fault could be found with Starter
Holtman for using the recall flag in the
fifth event. Headwater was second choice
In tbe betting and the horse's backers
were certainly entitled to a run for their
money.
Track Notes.
Much coin was burned up by the per
formance of Parader in the opening selec
tion, a Bix-furlong sprint. The Atkln &
lyottridge entry was reported to have
broken several watches in his morning
try-outs, and from threes the price was
thumped to 8 to 5. Away none too well,
the gelding ran like a hoosier. Dominick
got Daniel off flying- and never headed
beat The Miller out in a hard drive. Con
ley on Formatus ran third. The winner
opened a 7 to 5 choice, receding to 14 to a.
Ab Stember's filly Eonic made short
work of Bernota in the mile selling- affair
which, followed. Closing a slight favor
ite she led from start to nnish, winning
easily by eight lengths. See astride Im
promptu took the show from two others.
Dominick made it three straight by land-
Ing the two-year-old spin over four fur
longs with Torso Maid, owned by ex-
Jockey Johnny Weber. Huachuca, the fa
vorite, ridden by Charley Thorpe, was
much the best, but experienced poor rac
ing luck. Torso ilald outbroke the bunch,
and hard pressed at the wire downed the
first choice by a neck. Vasallo also had
a tempestuous trip, getting up in time to
run third.
Bookmaker Caesar Young's horse Sea
Lion was selected to win tne seven fur
long run, and with "Pi" Ruiz up made a
very poor showing. Although always con
sidered a mud horse, he was plunged on
at scant odds. While Ruiz apparently
rode for all that was in him, he could
never get closer up than fourth. Dollie
Weithoff led for a time and then quit.
Just when it looked as if Nansen, the
mount of Dominick, would win, Rio Shan
non dropped from the clouds, scoring by
a length. Alaska, a 10 to 1 shot, disposed
of the favorite for show honors.
Headwater gave Starter Holtman a
world of trouble at the post in the six fur
long purse run, absolutely refusing to
break. Finally, after a vexatious delay,
the neld was dispatched without him.
Tayon, tbe even money favorite, had his
time occupied in subduing Beau Ormonde,
but eventually headed the three-year-old,
and ridden out reached home a head to
the good in 1:13%. Sly ran poorly, losing
third place to Gibraltar.
Elmwood farm's MacGyle, piloted by
Dominick, was chosen to take the final
mile and a sixteenth event. The Brutus
horse led only a short way when he was
passed by Donator. The latter horse pos
sessed speed to burn, winning eased up.
Deepite hard urging the favorite was
nosed out for the place by Goldone.
Favorites annexted three purses, just
about holding their own. For old times'
sake. Rio Shannon, with "Handridlng"
Kelly up. dropped in first for the fourth
number at odds ranging: from 20 to 30 to 1.

SUMMARY.
The crackers popped in the first inning
as if two Fourths of July had fallen into
Recreation grounds. Brockhoff, Hutchin
son, Householder, right off the reel, rolled
out substantial hits and Reilly followed
soon after with' a safe one. â¢ All scored
but Hutchinson. who died at third. Swin
dells came to the bat later on for a base
on balls and Bowman for a hit, which
heiped the cause of the rising Angels.
But Oakland was not to be submerged
by the peppering of their twirler. Babbitt.
The Dudes took to the stick and did some
thing that forced a- couple of rings at the
end of the first spasm. . Drennan punched
Hale's curves for a double and Francks
followed with a single, Drennan scoring.
Then Arrellanes hit", Brockhoff committed
an error, Dunleavy hit to Reilly. Francks
scoring, and, through the kindness of Um
pire â¢ Donohue, Arrellanes was called out
at third. After this the side was soon re
tired. " 'Â«.;.
In the second both teams sent a single
man over. the rubber and in the third Oak
land tied tho score. Arrellanes and Dun
leavy passed the plate on a double by
Moore. A run in the fourth by the Angels
put them in .the lead for a time. In the
fifth, with two ' men crowding the bags,
Babbitt struck out three in succession,
and when the Dudes came to the stick
Francks scored, thus tying the game.
Three hits gave the Oaklanders a lead of
two runs in the sixth and in the seventh
they increased the advantage by another
stroke. The score: **

Flaw excited the wonder of hundreds by
the tremendous fling he gave the 16-pound
hammer. He was only able, however, to
throw the 16-pound hammer 144 feet 6%
inches from the seven-foot, circle. After
winning his event he tried for the world's
record from the nine-foot circle and se
cured it by throwing the hammer 171 feet
2 inches. One of his throws measured 180
feet, but was not counted, : as. he. over
stepped the circle. Following Is the sum

The mile walk engendered the only bad
feeling displayed during the day. CaDtaln
Walsh claimed that he had been fouled
by Lously of Stanford and reiterated his
charge while going around the track.
Lously. lost his temper and struck Walsh
and Hamlin rushed In and landed on the
Stanford ' i youth. There was hissing
throughout the race and when Zschokke
captured first place in record time the
Stanford rooters made the welkin ring
with their yells. Lously was ruled off the
track for his unsportsmanlike action and
John Elliott Informed him that he would
bring the matter before the Pacific Ama
teur Association and have him suspended
for twelve months. Lously claims that
"Walsh crowded him. â¢ threatened him and
used vile language. â¢Walsh, on the other
hand, claims that Lously elbowed hon
and fouled him continually. The mile
walk will be eschewed in future by the
colleges, as it is not deemed an athletic
event. â¢
Henley, the TJkiah athlete, in whom
Stanford had â¢ abundant faith, did not
shine to advantage. In the high jump he
could only do 5 feet 9% inches, whereas he
had gone over the bar at 6 feet while at
High School. Powell and Cooley tried
hard to surpass their efforts, but without
success. â¢ â¢ ..
Roy Service proved himself the best dis

the half-mile and the mile with compara

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
"W., WASHINGTON, April 20.â George A.
Newhall, George W. McNear and Andrew
Corrigan, 'representing the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, held a conference
to-day with President McKinley and Sec
retary Root regarding the transportation
of the Government. supplies between San
Francisco and. Manila, and the possible
establishment of a private steamship line
between these points. Â¦ . '
The San Franciscans strongly urged the
building of an American line from the
Pacific Coast; to the Orient and impressed
upon the President and Secretary of War
the advisability , of the Government en
couraging such an enterprise by, granting
to the new line a part of the enormous
traffic of the Government to the Philip
pines. With a guarantee or a reasonable
certainty of a fair share of the Govern
ment business, the delegation assured the
officials that an American Oriental line
would be established with the most bene
ficial results in the development of Amer
ican trade in â¢/ the Philippines and the
East. . -i
The establishment of , this enterprise
would not involve the abandonment of
the Government transport service in- the
Pacific, which is indispensable under the
present conditions in the Philippines, but
a _ diversion of, part of the Government
business to the new* line would enable the
War Department to dispense with many.,
or all chartered vessels now in the trans-^
port service." â¢. ' . Â¦ ,
The delegation say that the President
and Secretary Root are in sympathy with
the proposition, and look favorably upon
all possible Government encouragement
of the movement to build up the Ameri
can trade in the Philippines and Far East
and the transportation of American goods
in American bottoms. The "War Depart
ment wili take the matter . under â¢ consid
eration. Meanwhile the Chamber of Com
merce, delegation will visit New Tork In
the interest of the scheme and probably
return here for a further consultation'
with the Government officials, by whom
they were most cordially received to-day.-

deaths:
IDEATES AMONG TEOOPS.
Mr. Heggerty also expects to prove
that three persons other Â¦ than Mrs.
Dunning ate as large an amount of
the alleged poisoned candy as Mrs. Dun
ning did and were not taken ill. -If this
contention is proven to be a fact. Mrs.
Botkin's attorneys - state .It will appear
that Mrs. Dunning, if her death was due
to arsenical poisoning, was given the drug
through some medium other than the
candy.
. Mr. Heggerty stated that he desired the
presence of the Delaware witnesses to
show that the doctors who treated Mj-s.
Dunning did not know the cause of the
illness which caused her death.
Mr. Knight also explained that when
the Uelaware witnesses were sent for he
would ask the court. In . the interest of
common justice, to authorize the payment
of the expenses of some twenty witnesses
who will be called upon to testify on be
half of the defendant.
Mrs. . Cordelia Botkin will not again be
tried for the murder of Mrs. John P. Dun
ning at Dover, Del., alleged to have been
committed by means of poisoned candy
sent through the mails,- until after' the.
United States courts have passed on the
jurisdiction of the California courts to try
her. A writ of error will be applied for
in the United States District Court and
the case carried through to the Supreme
Court of the United States before any fur
ther action will be taken to try her again
in the Superior Court of this, city and
county.
Attorneys Knight and' Heggerty were
notified yesterday that the case was about
to again be placed on the calendar in
Judge Cook's court. Mr. Knight went im
mediately to District Attorney Bylngton
and requested that no action be taken in
the case until after the matter of the writ
of error had been disposed of by the
United States courts. If the case was put
on the calendar, Mr. Knight stated, it
would necessitate a trial in the near future,
which would call for the presence of the
witnesses from Dover, Del. Â¦ If after their
arrival proceedings were instituted in the
United States courts it would stay the
proceedings in â¢ the Superior . Court " for
such a length of time that the Delaware
witnesses would be forced to return home,
which would mean considerable loss to
the State. -';.â¢Â¦ : . ,

Work was commenced yesterday on the
floral designs that will blossom out a wel
come to President McKinley when he vis
its the park. The designs are patriotic.
An ordinance introduced by Commit
sioner Lloyd prohibiting the shooting of
seals or the discharge of firecrackers,
bombs and other noisy things in or about
the vicinity of Seal Rock was taken under
consideration until the next meeting.
A committee from the Epworth League
has asked that appropriate floral designs
be planted before the July convention,
and that the giving of a sacred concert
Borne afternoon during the week be al
lowed. The request will be granted.
Efforts are to be made to have a larger
band and better music on Sundays and
holidays. â¢ Commissioner . McDonald will
interview the officers and directors of the
Market Street Railway with a view to
ward getting a larger appropriation for
music.
Two new fountains are to be erected
near the Music Valley, and Commisisoner
Stanton, who accepted the designs, was
Instructed to select places for them. The
fountains will be of granite, capped by a
vase, from which flowering vines Â¦will
trail. On the face a lion's head and open
shell, with fishes supporting it, will sup
ply and receive the water. The coat of
arms of the city will be cut into the stone.
These fountains will be placed in position
immediately.
Commissioner McDonald Is turning the
children's play ground almost upside
down with improvements, and oxpects' to
make it fulfill the purposes for which it
was originally intended. He reported that
the work of improvement was rapidly pro
gressing and that the play ground would
be In condition on May day for the recep
tion of the youngsters. A big tent will be
erected, under which the children will be
fed in relays, a gaudily decked Maypole
will be planted on the lawn, new swings
will be erected, the donkeys and goats
will be replenished and pink lemonade of
the "really and truly" circus kind will be
on tap. There are other features, including
a Punch and Judy show and a performing
bear that may be added to the pro
gramme.
Golden Gate Park will echo with the
merry shouts of children on May day.' So
Park Commissioners Lloyd, McDonald
and Stanton decided at their meeting yes
terday afternoon. They decided to throw
the park wide open to the youngsters on
that day, and Superintendent McLaren,
who is a veteran in such affairs, was in

DUMBARTON. April 20.â Shamrock" II
was- satisfactorily launched to-day at
Denny's yards in the presence of a crowd
of invited guests, newspaper men and
employes. Lady Dufferin christened the
new challenger, which looked spick and
span in its coat. of white paint, rimmed
with green, while the manganese bottom
of the boat shone like a mirror.- - .
Lord and Lady Dufferin, Sir Thomas
Lapton and others, who came from Glas
gow upon a special train, stood upon a
raised platform decorated with Union
Jacks, the Stars and Stripes and the Irish
flag and with Venetian masts in green and
white, which were the prevailing colors.
Throughout the weather . could not have
been better. The sun shone brightly and
overcoats were discarded. The employes
of the Dennys had a holiday, and in fact
all Dumbarton was en fete to see Lady
Dufferin break the bottle of wine over
the curiously snub-nosed bow of the boat.
The British experts are very confident
about the now boat and think her the best
that ever challenged for the cup.
"But if you don't win," said a corre
spondent to Sir Thomas Lipton, "will you
try It again?"
"I expect next year to build a defender,
not a challenger," was the diplomatic
answer. ..
In this connection the manager of Den.
nys' yard said: "When James Gordon
Bennett saw Shamrock II here a few
weeks ago he said, 'Well, if she wins I'm
prepared to build a challenger.' "
At 11:45 a. m. to-day Sir Thomas Lipton
personally conducted correspondents over
and under the Shamrock II. This minute
inspection confirmed the description of
the cup challenger cabled last night. She
is- built to a general, type, but embodies
such novelties as prove her designers pur
sued an independent line. of development,
rather than followed yachting conven
tions. â¢

Special IMspatch to Tha Cali.
! OLIXDA, April 20.-One of the most dis
astrous as well as dangerous fires ever
known in this oil field occurred on the
Santa Fe lease last night. Well No. 21. on
the Santa Fe lease, which until recently
has been drilling at a depth of mere than
130O feet, was put on the pump on Thurs
day and M. I*. Cain, who has been in
charge of the water plant at the old Olin
da ranchhouse, was installed as pumper.
This well is at the bottom of a small and
rocky canyon, with nearly perpendicular
sides, and is almost exactly in the center
of the Socuel Canyon field. The boiler la

tomary In this section, where heavy gas
welfare to be expected â and the gas lino
running from welt No. IS passes just to
the east and within a few feet of this
boiler.
At intervals during the entire week thii
-well has been flowing occasionally as
much as twenty-five barrels of 33-degree
oil at one outburst. Tnen. if the well
were again put on the pump, only water
with a very little oil could be got out of
the hole. About 3:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon the well commenced flowing and
continued to put out a good grade of oil
until about 4 o'clock, when Cain again
started the pump. Much of the oil thrown
up during that time was allowed to run
down the slump ditch to a point 200 feet
below the well, where a low dirt dam had
been previously thrown across the canyon.
About this time, too, volumes of gas
were pouring out of i;he well and several '
experienced men expressed their view as
to the danger of pumping such a well by
night, and recommended that it be shut
down. At"8:30 o'clock the pumper started
to go â taking his lantern with him â from
the boiler to the derrick. He had barely
crossed the gas line when a wave of gas
came drifting down a little gully in the
mountainside, enveloping man and lan
tern. The explosion was instantaneous
and so terrific as to awaken every sleep
ing person on the Santa Fe, Fullerton and
Olinda leases.
Cain was thrown violently to the ground,
but managed to get to his feet after a
few seconds and staggered up the hillside
to a place of safety.
The flames rushed up ti.e path laid for
them by this outburst of gas, and before
anything could be done the derrick was
a tower of fire, while torrents of burning
oil were thrown fully 200 feet into the .
air by the enormous pressure of the bil
lions of cubic feet of gas in the hole be
neath. The burning spray fell on the hill
sides for more than 100 feet around the
derrick, and this space was soon burned
clear of grass and underbrush.
After razing the oil-soaked derrick the
flames attacked the belt and engine
houses, soon converting both into beds
of charcoal, while the shafts of the en
gine and most of the other iron work are
so sprung that they can never be used
again.
Within a half hour after the fire started
100 people had gathered from the sur
rounding leases and were seated on an
adjacent hillside watching the costly
pyrotechnics.
Gas is -still pouring from the projecting
casing, and the hungry flames are lick
ing it up almost before it can leave the
hole. Occasionally outbursts occur, when,
small a.uantities of burning oil are thrown
from twenty to fifty feet into the air. ]
thus rendering work among the still smol
dering timbers both difficult and danger
ous.

BERLIN, April 20.â Regarding foreign
politics, the sentiment In German political
circles is rather despondent just now.
Among*the well informed the impression
prevails that the Dreibund's renewal this
time is assured, but at the same time Italy
is regarded suspiciously, and disagreeable
surprises in Italy's foreign policy are con
sidered not improbable, in spite of the
Dreibund.
In the face of official denials here, it
Is considered that. Italy will insist on the
alteration of certain paragraphs in the
Dreibund agreement, and it is also cer
tain that Italy's rapprochement with
France is regarded here unfavorably,
since the race and religious affinities be
tween the two countries, once rapproche
ment is affected, will work increasingly.
Germany, on her part. Is dissatisfied with
Italy because Germany has been a steady
loser in the Italo-German commercial
treaty, and because of Italy's inability to
assist Germany in her lately inaugurated
world policy, which the Emperor earnestly
pushes. It is also said the young Italian
King harbors ' little sympathy for Ger
many, owing to the influence of his edu
cation and more recently of his Slav wife,
whose sympathy I? altogether Russian.
The leading papers this week contained
articles on the subject. The Post says
the' efforts to disrupt the harmony of the
Dreibund powers are futile. The Vossische
Zeitung points out the number of faults
committed in the German foreign policy
lately, leading almost to isolation, and
mentions in this connection Great Brit
ain's coquetting with Russia and Italy's
coquetting with France, M. Delcasse's
trip to Sc. Petersburg and M. Waldeck-
Rousseau's trip to Verona.
The Kreuz - Zeiting wonders why there
is this universal hatred against Germany,
including that of the United States, as
evinced commercially, and by the fre
'quently hostile attitude of the United
States toward Germany in China. The

not gone to war except by joining the
other powers In the China expedition.

The Oregon Short Line is laying track
toward the Summit, near Uvada. while the
Clark forces, who are still holding the
barricaded tunnel No. 1, are hurrying
teams and men to the front of the tunnel,
where grading is actively in progress.
Both sides express the determination not
to give up the disputed grade, and trouble,
if any should result, will come when the
Short Line forces attempt to lay track to
tunnel No. 1, which is practically the only
passage for the proposed road at that
point. The opposing construction forces

SAN'RAFAEL, April 30.â Caught In the
whirling current that sweeps past Towns
Point, on Point San Pedro, yesterday,
Gustave Kohlhoff, a resident of this city,
nearly lost his life. In company with a
friend of Mr. Kohlhoff was bass fishing on
Perch Rock, off Towns Point. After fish
ing for some hours he got into a frail
skiff and started for shore to procure
fresh water. On the return trip some
time later he was caught in a tide eddv
off the Point and his boat was nearly
swamped.
While attempting to bail the boat both
oars were lost and Mr. Kohlhoff found
himself at the mercy of the swift out
going tide. A fisherman some distance
away was attracted by his calls for help
and went to the rescue. Mr. Kohlhoff
was found clinging to his sinking boat and
had all but given up hope.
Mr. Kohlhoff was a clerk in the late

MONTEZUMA COPPER AND COAL.
The following letter from a shareholder ex-
plains itself:
SACRAMENTO. Cal.. April 17, 1901.
The American Guaranty and Trust Co. â
Gentlemen: I have only recently returned
from a trip to Seattle and Tacoma. taken with
the specific purpose of investigating the man-
agement and properties of the Montezuma Min-
ing Company. I must say your description does
not do Justice to the valuable copper and coal
properties you are developing. Your 1800 acres
of coal lands could not be improved upon for
maximum of results with minimum of expense,
since a great canyon divides the property, cut-
ting many veins of clear coal varying from 3
ft 6 Inches to 9 ft 2 inches. (An 11 foot vein
has been opened since the writer's visit.) There
is unlimited supply of wood and water. The
copper mines are being developed Into valuable
propertiesâ the ore ranging from $40 to $300 a
ton.
The personnel of the directory I found second
to none, and as a result of my investigations I
unreservedly recommend "Montezuma" as a
safe investment Respectfully yours,
A. M. AUBERTUS,
810 Seventh street

REPORT OF PROGRESS.
SEATTLE, Waeh., April 5, 1901.
Mr. J. S. C. Thompson, General Manager,
The American Guaranty and Trust Co.
My Dear Mr. Thompson: We had a Board
meeting yesterday and went into matters quite
thoroughly. We found everything in excellent
ehape. Col. Thompson (President of the Monte-
zuma) somehow always does a little better
than he promises, and his report at this meet-
ing was no exception. We have authorized an
air comDressor at thÂ» Tacoma mine, the pur-
chase of 160 acres of coal land adjoining our
lease, and the improvement of the Mowich trail
by which we save miles of distance. The com-
pany's books were examined, and we have
every reason to believe the affairs of the com-
pany are carried on with real economy and in
a thoroughly practical way. We were pleased
to find by examination of the bank book that
the company had a handsome credit balance
April 1, with not one cent of indebtedness.
The "Tacoma" mine is just now the center
of Interest here. The great vein of highly
mineralized stone has widened out from 6 ft. to
9 ft., as reported to you a day or two ago. but
better than all. the quality of the ore has im-
proved immensely. While the amount of cop-
per Is uniformly maintained, the gold content
of the stone is greatly improving, showing half
an ounce to an ounce of gold to a ton. The
silver values are fully maintained. It is need-
less to say we are all extremely enthusiastic
over the great "Tacoma" mine. We believe it
Is the best show on the Pacific Coast.
We have nothing new from the coal properties
since the uncovering of the 11 ft vein a few
days ago. Our men are getting out coal every
day, but this work cannot be pushed until the
flume has been completed; then the flume Is
contingent upon the construction of the saw-
mill, upon which efforts are now being directed.
As eoon as the flume is done we shall be heard
of in the right way at the coal mines. Yours
faithfully, . E. M. SHELTON.
Director Shelton will be at our office Mon-
day and perhaps for several days during the
week. Shareholders and others are invited to
call and meet him.

The easier tone of foreign money markets
also helped to relieve the pressure on New
York fcr gold. All of the great foreign banks,
the banks of England and France and the
Imperial Bank of Germany, Â« show notable re
cuperation of reserves this' week, apparently
in preparation for the placing of the new issue
of British consols. British financial authori
ties have been congratulating themselves that
the recuperation of New York banking reserves
has been with the same object. But the eager
speculators in the stock market obviously do
not Â»hare this view and they continue their
insatiable demands for credits to push their
speculative ventures. Sub-Treasury operations
have contributed an important supply to. New
York money resources by reason of the Gov
ernment bond redemptions, the large pension
dis^ursements and extraordinary payments by
the Government on account of the postofflce
and military expenditures. New York bank
clearinrs for the week have broken all pre
vious records by reason of the enormous deal
ings in the stock market. Money rates at in
terior iKjints have ehown a hardenins tend
ency on account of diversion -of funds to New
York. The Sub- Treasury's payments of pen
sions will decline next week and the further
supply of funds from the Government Â¦ institu
tion will depend on offerings of Government
bonds for redemption on the Treasury's terms.
Foreign exchange authorities maintain their
conviction that a considerable sum of gold will
go out to meet the requirements of' the London
market in floating the Â£30.000,000 issue of con
sols. There is to be considerable necessity for
provision for the Burlington deal, involving, as
announced, the formation of a $50,000,000 un
derwriting syndicate. But any doubt over
the future of the money supply was completely
submerged as the week progressed under the
buoyant hopefulness caused by present plenty.
The consummation of the Burlington. deal has
produced a crop of rumors of projects for other
transcontinental alliances to offset this- project,
which have met with denials from official
sources and . by apparently ' inspired disclaim
ers of any oceah-to-ocean route being involved
in the Burlington deal. As corroboration for
this comes the intimation from St. Paul that
President J. J. Hill has taken speculative
profits on his holdings of Erie and Baltimore
and Ohio etocks and sold out. But this has
not checked the rumor mongers from making
Pennsylvania the buyer for control of Atchi
son and Northwestern, projecting a consolida
tion with Union Pacific. - These developments
point the difference of the Burlington deal
from the recent series of tranactions in the
Eastern trunk line territory. The latter had
for its object the formation of a community
of interest laterally among parallel lines in
competing territory, while the effect of the
Burlington deal is longitudinal in an exten
sion of control of connecting lines and a
strengthening for effect against rivals and the
possible result of retaliatory or compensatory
measures on the part of these rivals. Vast
problems of exchange of traffic with a net
work of connecting and competing lines are
thus brought into play. Tne speculation has
overflowed from stocks into same of the low
grade contingent payment bonds, and the
movement of prices of bonds has been irregu
lar. United States new fours declined W old

copper etocks looking to a consolidation of
Butte and Boston. Boston and Montana and
Amalgamated Copper was the basis of an ex
cited speculation in the last named stock on
the York Stock Exchange. But the most po
tent Influence in fomenting the continuance of
the speculation was the replenishment of the
money reserves of the New York banks. This
has caused some actual realization in money
rates in New York. A mere Arrest of the hard
ening tendency would doubtless have been suf
ficient to encourage the speculators to renewed
buying of stocks. The profitable mone" rate, in
fact, has been the cause of arresting the deple
tion of New York's reserves. Interior exchange
has risen to a premium causing demand for
remittance to New York to take advantage of
the high money rate here and sterling exchange
has been held under the gold export level, al
though its hardening tendency whenever money
rates relaxed showed a sensitive condition.

"There is still some inquiry for apricots at
a low price, and the market is in better shape,
owing to reported damage . by f roet on the

Royals are said to be offering here from
Europe under the market, but as no samples

effect."
"Considering the slashing of prune prices

the present buylnc is altogether of a hand-to

fresh etocks come to hand. Arrivals last week
were not heavy, however, and present supplies
are still light. Some roods to arrive witnin
a few days are understood to be offered at the
new association basis. Buying from the coast
at the 2c price has been light; probably 29
cars would be a liberal estimate for this mar
ket elnce the cut was made early in the week.
Some of the business is understood to have
been done at less than %c to Vic under

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.

"NEW. YORK, April 20.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
London shares were only fairly active on the
stock market here to-day. â¢ The American de
partment was again the feature. Trading In
American shares was excited to a remarkable
degree and a tremendous business was done.
To-day's specialties were Chicago. Milwaukee
and St. Paul and the Union and Southern Pa
cifies. British consols were weaker to-day,
94%. on the rumor that the new Government
loan announcement would be made on Monday.
Copper stocks were strong.
Money was easier, with call loans 2@2#.
The bank has bought Â£13,000 gold bars and is
getting Â£20,000 In from Australia.
London Market.
. The Financier says: The associated banks
of New York added nearly $7,000,000 to their
surplus reserve last week, bringing the total
to $14, Â¥22,100, an amount larger than they have
reported since February 9 last. Loans are, now
thirteen million dollars less than at the date
named and deposits have decreased twenty
seven and one-third millions. It will be re
called that the expansion In these Items,
which caused new records to be made during
the middle *of February, started at the open
ing of the month, so that the banks are prac
tically back on the basis preceding these deals,
by far the largest ever consummated In this
country. As a matter of fact loans have now
decreased twenty-throe and a half millions
from the high point reached February 16.
There has been a shrinkage of forty-four mil
lions in deposits in the same time, while cash
holdings, despite gold exports, treasury absorp
tions and losses to the interior, etc., have de
creased only about nine millions. This is a
remarkable record and shows on its face that
the financing of transactions of unprecedented
magnitude have been accomplished with ease.
The current statement is .more favorable than
expected. The gain of $8,461,900 in cash is
about twice as large as preliminary estimates
had assumed, and in connection with a de
crease of loans of J8,SS9,000, which reduced de
posit liabilities, produced a reserve increase
larger than the actual gain in cash. It is
somewhat difficult to trace the origin of the
cash Increase. Operations with the treasury
resulted in a gain of three millions and the
remainder probably, represents the accumula
tion of interior funds in this city. Out-of
town banks, attracted by the rise in call funds,
have been loaning freely in this center and
the loan contraction represents In part at least
this transfer of loans. As regards the im
mediate outlook for money the present state
ments put a different face on the situation.
The pa3t week seems to have demonstrated
that any r'.se in quotations here must Invite
the offerings of interior surplus funds, and
as long as this can be counted on the prospect
of an unreasonable advance in funds io elim
inated entirely. If this theory Is correct noth
ing more than a steady money market can be
expected, the. tendency being downward rather
than upward. The ont factor that may oper
ate against this tendency is. the financing of
the British loan, in which American gold may
play a more or less Important part.
Surplus reserve, $14,022,100; increase, $6,893,000.

ment of averages - of the associated banks

FEELINC CAUSED
BY THE CHANGE
Election Is Ordered for
Major of Artillery
Battalion.
Troop A, Cavalry, Has Prac
tice Ride â Nerney Desires
a New Ship.
ThÂ« reduction of the First Infantry
Regiment from a twelve to an eight com
pany organization by the Board of Loca
tion and Organization for the purpose of
creating a battalion of coast artillery,
while It was not wholly unexpected by
those who are located In the Page-street
armory, has, now that It has been or
dered, created feeling against the com
panies of tho Ellis-street armory. At the
time that Thomas F. O'Neil was elected
colonel of the First the companies in the
Ellis-street armory manifested a feeling
of displeasure, at the result of the election
and while there was an apparent submis
sion to the will of the majority there was
a. great deal of thinking as to how tjie
four companies could be without the com
mand of the colonel who was not to their
liking. The suggestion was made that an
artillery battalion be formed and for some
time It was thought that It should be com
posed of light batteries. But then some
one suggested a battalion of coast defense
artillery and It was pointed out that such
a branch of the service would be more
likely to meet the approval of the body
that has the power to make changes in
the guard. And it did, as the order issued
last Friday shows. This, of course, takes
out of the FirsX the company letteri C,
G, F and K, and will necessitate a change
oi the company letters of the remaining
eight companies.
Number of Majors Beduced.
The reorganization has, as the order
from Sacramento directs, reduced the
number of majors In the First to two and
the battalion adjutants to a like number.
Major Robertson and Lieutenant Mc-
Guerren being, as the orders say, "re
lieved and placed on waking orders," a
new feature in the National Guard.
Orders were issued yesterday for an
election for major of the new battalion.
It will be held at the Ellis-street armory
on May 4. Major James A. Margo. in
spector on the Second Brigade stall, will
preside.
Captain Thomas J. Cunningham, who
returned with the First California Volun
teers as a major and on the reorganiza
tion of the First was re-elected captain of
Company K, is to prepare a list of the
necessary staff officers for the new bat-
JTor the position of major of the new or
ganization two candidates are named â
Henry T. Bush, on the retired list, for
merly colonel of the First, and Charles
Boxton, who returned from the Philip
pines with the First California Regiment
of Valunteers as lieutenant colonel and
Â¦who was defeated by O'Neil for the
colonelcy of the First. The former has
been very active In the matter of organ
izing a battalion of artillery, he holding
that such an organization In this city,
where there is but one regiment, would
arouse a generous rivalry the two
organizations and be the means of creat
ing more enthusiasm in the guard.
L>ast Sunday Troop A, Cavalry, Captain.
Charles Jansen commanding, to the num
ber of thirty-six, was out for a practice
march. The troop rode from the armory
on Market street through the Mission dis
trict to the San Bruno road and 'went as
far as Baden. After an hour for rest and
lunch the order to mount was srlven and
the troop rode across country to the, In
gleside track where there was a drill,
after which there was a ridÂ© to the ocean
highway and a ride home through the
park. The troop will parade In full dress
uniform on the occasion of the reception
of President McKlnley.
Nerney Wants a New Snip.
Captala-" Thomas A. Nerney, havlns: as
sumed command of the Naval Militia by
virtue of his recent election, says that the
militia, being now detached from the land
forces, will be recruited up and will con
form g-enerally to the provisions of the
laws of the United States and that the
system of discipline and exercise shall
conform as nearly as possible to that of
the United States navy. He is of the
opinion that when it shall be demonstrated
that the Naval Militia of California Is up
to date that a modern war vessel will be
substituted by the Navy r>epartment for
the old Marion. He Is of the opinion that
If the auxiliary, which may at any time
bÂ« called Into service. Is to be of any
practical value It should be Instructed on
a modern vessel Instead of one that has
become obsolete.
