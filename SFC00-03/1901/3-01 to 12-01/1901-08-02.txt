lution to the effect that "all requests for

The City Front Federation held action
on many plans in abeyance in the belief
that the end of the strike was at hand.
The leaders decided that no other unions
should be called out unless present nego
tiations should not prove successful.
"Negotiations are on foot," continued
Mr. Furuseth. "that may be expected to
bring results that will be highly gratify
ing to all who regret to see labor and cap
ital, at war. The end will not come to
night.'" but the outlook for peace is
bright."
Andrew Furuseth. secretary of the Sail
ors' Union, said late In the afternoon that
a. day or two should bring a solution of
the problem.
Mayor Phelan said last night that the
situation seemed much more hopeful than
at any other time since the general strike
was declared. Leading merchants,- he
eaid. who desired that for the present
their names be withheld, were co-operat
ing with him to secure careful considera
tion of all phases of the question and to
bring employer and employe to an under
standing of each other's attitude. '

inent merchants are alike hopeful that
to-morrow at the latest will see peace re

worklngmen will return to their former
employment.
Mayor Phelan has In his possession a
letter from the City Front Federation
asking for more light upon some features

fluenced by the general opinion that the
end of the strike is near and persuaded,
as well, by merchants who are trying to
effect a settlement of .the controversy,
prepared yesterday a draft of an agree
ment to which they would bind them
selves. This was done In anticipation of
a possible request from the Draymen's

would leave with a full cargo, and that
there would be no danger of any of their

Even this failed to convince the passen-*

dock yesterday morning many of them
thought they .would have to return to

with "freight and gangs of men working

among them had any knowledge of - the

Oceanic people went quietly to work and
before the strike. was on a half day had
secured help enough to assure them that
the Sierra would clear on time.
The sailing of the Sierra marked an
epoch in the strike. When the longshore

ter:
On Thursday evening:, July 25. four 'United

The strike leaders have organized a pa
trol extending over the whole water front,
the I object being to take care of any - in
toxicated strikers that may be found on
the streets, to discourage tendency to riot
and to persuade the strikers to keep away
from the docks and wharves. The Sailors'
Union has sixty men in the patrol and
Other unions are represented in the ratio
of their numerical strength. The patrol is
divided into four six-hour watches and
the water front Is thus under its surveil
lance day and night. , Two officers of the
City, Front Federation are in charge, one
during the day; and the other at night.
The labor leaders say that this patrol will
effectively maintain the. peace -that, has
prevailed on the. water front since' the
strike began.
.The 'Senator praised the action of the
members of "the Pacific Coast Firemen's
Union, who remained with the firm de

'.'The firemen," -said Senator Perkins,

walked- out. The , firemen pursued the
more honorable Â¦ course and remained at
work. ; The sailors deliberately broke the
contract they entered into with our firm
only two months ago. -They really ought

The City Front Federation met last

tlon transacted only business of a routine
character. .The various phases of the
strike were" discussed at length, . but no
action of importance was taken.
The necessity for preserving the 'peace
along the water front was urged upon the
strikers. While It was shown that they
had conducted themselves thus far. in. the
most orderly manner and that, the
troubles of the last few days were caused
by persons who are In no way connected
with the strike, it was deemed advisable
to caution all men , affiliated with the
unions to refrain from assembling at the
front, or in any way : to manifest * feeling
against the employers in public places. Â¦ ,
The Japanese Society notified the federa
tion that no Japanese would be allowed to
take the places of the strikers who are
locked out or are now. out on strike. The
sympathy of the. Japanese, \. wrote the
president of the society, was " with â¢ the
strikers, and they would assist the union
men in every possible way, he added. â¢
It was definitely decided that no more
unions would be called upon to strike in

negotiations for settlement which are now
in progress had > been abandoned.

â¢ The accident occurred at about 5 o'clock
near the corner of Fourth and Townsend

by J. B. Bocarde & Co. since the. com

driver, had just finished unloading a quan
tity of merchandise at the Southern Pa
cific transfer sheds, and was on his' way
to the stables.- He was accompanied by
Officer Armstrong as a guard against the
strikers. When Nelson was about to cross
the railroad track at Sixth and Townsend
streets he was advised . by â¢ Officer Arm
strong to turn a little to the' right of the
road In order to Â«ecape the cobble stones.
The turn necessitated the team going be
hind a small shed -before crossing the
track. While the men were riding behind
the shed they were unable to see the:
switch engine, which was rapidly speeding'
down the track, and the moment they;
emerged from behind the obstruction the.
train collided with the truck striking it
directly behind the front wheels. Both
men were Instantly hurled to the ground,
but luckily fell clear of the track. The

fortunately only one of the horses was

When Thompson and the McAulliffes ap

crowd sprang upon the three teamsters,
who sought in vain to escape the rain of
blows that fell upon them- Suddenly the
sound of a pistol was heard and W. Â¦ Mc-

Mulligan could not walk the distance,

upon a novel plan. He proposed to float
down the Colorado River on a log. The
trip could not be -made in the night, for
the river runs rapidly and whins from
one bank to the other. ,
It was early in the morning when Mul
ligan shook his employer's hand, strad
dled his log and started. The swift cur
rent whirled him rapidly away. The log
foundered repeatedly upon a sandbar,
when the passenger would be forced to
take a ducking. At times he became too
tired to hold his position longer. Instead
of making shore for a rest, however, he
slipped into the water, and holding to the
log with one arm would swim alongside.
Thus, alternately riding and floundering
along, he finally reached Yuma thor
oughly exhausted and suffering from in
numerable blisters received during his
thrilling ride. He had fought the river
for more than six hours.

The loading of the Coptic, which is

slowly. The freight is being handled by
the Chinese crews of the Mall steamers
and they are not a success as longshore

awakened to the fact that to get their

About the only place on the water front

freight is cleared away there vrill be no

they started to sing the songs of their

a graceful waving of arms. The crowd on
the dock responded with vigorous hand

Inasmuch as the. Mayor, has given his as

could be advanced for a speedy solution
of the trouble, certain local merchants
yesterday urged upon the Draymen's As

with the teamsters themselves.- Should

. On the other hand, the members of the
federation say that to yield the privilege

of weakness on the part of the employes.
This being generally accepted as true, the
influence and power, of the unions would

BRAVES PERIL
FOR COMPANION
The unjon yesterday detailed about 250
business Â» agents and scouts armed with
proper credentials to order out any mem
bers who have thus far failed to obey the.
order to strike." .It being the first of the
month yesterday, and many having de

the number of the strikers was consider
ably augmented during the day. ' It is be
lieved that fully 100 men went on strike
yesterday. - .< \- * *- Â¦
The facility with which the merchants
fill the places of the strikers has ; caused
many of the porters and packers to waver
in their determination to stand by Â¦ the
union. To further aggravate the situation
as far as the union strikers are concerned
a report was circulated during the day
that the strike had been settled and that
the porters and packers were falling over
one another In their efforts to get back
Business Ag-ents Detailed.
At the present time some 1400 porters,
packers and warehouseman are on strike.
While all of these have not registered at
headquarters as â¢ directed, the most of
them have done so. It Is estimated by the
union offlcials-that fully 1800 members are
out and that the majority of the remain
ing membership will, be out by to-mor
row. Sinee the strike began, sixty resig
nations fronv the .union' have been- re
ceived. Of that number, about fifteen were
subsequently withdrawn.
.Notwithstanding reports that a settle
ment of the strike may ' be . expected to
come at any moment, ' walkouts are con
stantly taking, place. In , addition to ten
men who walked out* of the glass works
at Harrison and Fifteenth .streets on

STEAMSHIP SIERRA SAILS,

Â« II causing: considerable uneasiness

H facturers. The leaders of the
strike recognize the indlspensabil
lty of coal and are concentrating- their
efforts to prevent its transportation from
the colliers to the wharves, or from the
bunkers of the wholesale merchants to
the factories. So great Is the strike lead
ers' desire to cause a scarcity of coal that
permission has' even been refused union
factories to haul it for their own use.
Every effort that was made yesterday
by the merchants to remove coal from
the colliers was successfully combated.
Not a single longshoreman, except where
the strongest police protection was af
forded, would work. The merchants state
that the real flght in the coal controversy
will not take place until next week. Then
Jt Is expected, if the Etrike continues, that
in some quarters the scarcity will be no
ticeable, and then, too," the big colliers
f rcm British Columbia are scheduled to
arrive. The merchants fear not so much
for private families, as It is believed they
can be easily cared for with the supply
which is now on hand; but in the case of
the big factories, which consume thou
f-anfis of tons each week, it is different.
MERCHANTS ASK THE DRAYMEN
Even If the coal . does-- arrive: in great
quantities, and"even~IÂ£'men are secured
to unload it on the wharves, It is feared
that teamsters cannot be procured to haul
a sufficient supply to the big: factories.
Teamsters can \ only be induced to work
when a strong police guard is offered, and
already the entire available police force
is engaged In protecting drivers on trucks
and. express wagons. -The merchants, are
at a loss to know where they will obtain
protection for their coal carts.
it was rumored when the possibility of
a coal famine. first became evident that
It was the intention of the strikers to in
jure the canneries," But this rumor proved
to be without foundation, as all the can
neries are equipped with oil furnaces and
use pil entirely. The oil is transported to,
the city and In moot instances to the
doors of the factory on the cars, ana no
tie-up in that direction is expected in the
immediate future.- :.-Â¦-. . . â¢
The report which was industriously! cir
culated yesterday to the effect that the
merchants are preparing to seek the aid
of the Employers' Association in prevent
ing the coal famine was denied last night
by John Kosenfeld. He said the dealers
would depend on the supply now in their
bunkers as long as possible and that they

into their old places. The report was gen
erally believed and some excitement re
sulted. Business Agent Loughery of the
union vehemently denied the rumors that
-were in circulation, and assured the men
that the strike was still on. . Â¦
In discussing the situation yesterday
Mr. Loughery said: - -
"The strike of the porters, packers Â«""!
warehousemen is doing nicely. -The great
er number of our membership is out ana
fully determined to flght to the bitter end.
It is a noticeable fact that the most de
termined strikers are men of family,
while the lukewarm are single men with
out any one depending upon them for sup
port. Of the number of porters and pack
ers who are still at their work, 90 per cent
are unmarried men.
Married Men Determined.
"The married men realize that they have
their all at stake, and they are the ones
Â¦who are fighting 1 the bosses hardest.
withstanding that .there are some mem
bers -of the union who are holding out
against orders to quit work, the response
to- date has been more than gratifying.
There will be no backdo-tf-n this time. The
merchants who are filling the places oÂ£
strikers with scab laborers are already be
ginning to weaken. They know that they
cannot get along well without the men
who are acquainted with all the details
of : their, business. This thing of ' breaking
in new crews is not only laborious but ex
pensive. . I look for the merchants and
wholesalers to call it off before the ex
piration of three days. If they were will
ing-, to recognize the right of their em
ployes to Join unions, the trouble -would
end immediately. We are anxious to set
tle on those terms at once." ?
The officials of the union have cautioned
all members to refrain from assembling In
crowds or gathering along ' the water
front. Sign3 bearing this request have
been tacked to the walla at headquarters,
and all strikers are asked to do all in
their power to preserve the peace. The
strikers claim that they have at no time
been the aggressors in the recent troubles,
and they shift the blame to the police,
who. they say, are entirely too willing to
use their clubs on the slightest provoca
tion. The porters, packers and ware
housemen are unanimous in declaring for
a peaceful adjustment of the present dif
ficulty, and they say that any member of

noon witnessed the closing of a deal which
will put an end to a ten-year wrangle be
tween the city and the water companies
by the purchase by the city of both of tht

own distributing plant and also its own
pumping plant and supply in the San Di
ego River. It is expected, however, that
within a year the city will purchase its.
supply from the mountains, as it can be
purchased more cheaply than it can be
pumped.
Everything was arranged for the trans
fer in accordance with the contracts made
and entered into six months or more ago,
before the election, at which $500,000 in
bonds was voted for the purpose of rais
ing money to pay for the plant. A meet
ing of all concerned was held to-day at
the office of the City Treasurer. Mason
I>ewis & Co., the bon'd buyers, turned the
money Into the treasury and it was in
turn passed over to the representatives of
the water companies for the deeds to their
property. C. S. Alverson was chosen "su-^

These terms are denominated by those who
have the best Interests of the organization oC
the steel workers at heart as the most unfair,
the most unjust ever proposed to any body of
workingmen by a set of employers or a cor
poration. The terms are such that the ex
ecutive board of the Amalgamated Association
cannot accept and has already gone on record
to that effect.
To-morrow morning the answer of Mor
gan is expected by mail. There is scarcely e
a fragment of hope that the Amalgamated
Association will back down from Its well
known position. The leaders of the work
ers will in reply outline their plans to the
Steel Corporation tor a continuation of
the great struggle. They will include tho
stopping of every wheel possible in tho
works of the combine and the' extension
of the strike in all possible directions by
the Amalgamated Association.

MORGAN MAZES FLAT REFUSAL.
It Is Said That He Will Not Accede
to Latest Demands.
PITTSBURG, Aug. 1.â The Commercial
Gazette will say: The Amalgamated ex
ecutive board last evening received by tel
egraph a flat refusal from J. Pierpont
Morgan to reopen the wage conference
where it was broken off at the Hotel Lin
coln nearly three weeks ago. The pow
ers of the steel combine Insist in this
communication the only basis of settle
ment will be on the terms . which the
financial backer of the combine. President
Schwab and Chairman Elbert H. Gary
laid down at the meeting with the Amal

last Saturday.
A member of the executive board of

fast as its importance will permit. *> r a<yyÂ«*aB^
No member has expressed any opinion or giv
ing any statement of the business, or of the
attitude of other members. . â¢
Nothing has been made public, neither will
any report Issue from us until a definite con
clusion is reached. .We are simply trying to
reach a settlement which shall bo honorable
and satisfactory to all concerned.
Board Stands as a Unit.
"Whatever differences might have-ex
isted are Bald to have been adjusted sat
isfactorily and the board stands us a
unit for its demand for the renewal of
the conference with the manufacturers*
representatives. To accept Morgan's
propositions as they now, stand would only
complicate matters more, according to the
officials of the association. .Whether Mor
gan will answer the request of the Amal
gamated Association or not seems to be
a question that even the association offi
cers do not care to state positively that
if he does not there can be no settlement
at this time of the strike. Morgan's
silence is regarded by some as significant
and ominous. Others profess to believe
that he is in consultation with other offi
cials of the United States Steel Corpora
tion and will answer shortly.
The secretiveness of the meeting of the
Amalgamated men, which has character
ized the preceding meetings, was con
tinued to-day. The members of the ex
ecutive board gathered early In the morn
ing and remained confined In the confer
ence rooms of the headquarters all day
with the exception of a brief lunch hour.
There were the same guards placed out
side of the offices and newspaper men
were kept back from all approaches to
the meeting.
State Arbitrator Present.
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon President
Shaffer, acting on behalf of the board,
sent word to the newspaper men that
there would be en statement given out for
publication to-day and that there would
be a meeting of the board to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock to consider matters
before It. The meeting did not adjourn
at this hour, however,. but remained in
session until nearly 6 o'clock.
The message sent to Morgan, while not
so stated. Is believed to be an ultimatum
to the head of the United States Steel
Corporation. It is viewed as such by the
labor leaders about Pittsburg. If the steel
workers do not get their demand for this
conference the Â¦ strike will go on indefin
itely. None of the officials of the organ
ization would discuss, this point to-day.
They still maintained their silence and
said they had nothing to give out. At
noon, after the ; executive board had been
In cession all morning and in a formal
manner waited for a reply from Morgan,
the members decided to make an official
denial of the report that there was a lack
of harmony In their ranks. To the re
porters present they gave out the fol
lowing:

Ultimatum Sent to Morgan.
P1TTSBURG. Aug. 1.â The third til
day session of the Amalgamated
"Association executive board . has
passed without action being taken
on the New York conference
peace proposals. Another session will be
held to-morrow. The executive I board ' of
the association is in fact wal tine foe a
word from J. Pierpont Morgan, to whom
an ultimatum is said to have been sent.
; After the .board had heard from Prest
dent Shaffer concerning his trip to New
York last week it was decided to request
a change in the propositions of Morgan,
and a message was sent to Morgan, an
nouncing, its decision on thla^ matter.
In explanation of this message the Amal
gamated Journal says: â¢_â¢, . ,
The executive board desires another confer
ence with the representatives of the constitu
ent companies and will remain. In the city un
til an answer is received. Upon the result of
that answer will depend whether the strike
will- be prolonged indefinitely.
In the: same statement of the result of
the conference of the executive board tno
Journal .has this to : say:
-The strike, situation aa we go' to press Is
about "the same as it was a week ago so far
as' the working conditions of the mills are
concerned. No attempt has been made to start
any of the closed mills outside of the Wells

pany, and their effort In this Instance has been
a failure.

Senor Esteres said this battle was
fought July 29. and that 16,000 troops of
the Venezuelan army. were engaged In it.
"As I understand the message," said the
Consul General, '.'the 5000 revolutionists

defeated by our troops a few days before.
I believe the revolution Is at an end, but
there may arise . complications . between
our Government and that of Colombia.
President Castro refers to the revolution
as the Colombian inroad because the In

country. Their leader. Dr. Rangel Gar

I The above headlines announce another sale. While the values given will interest you
most, maybe you would like to know our reasons.
August is a dull month. With the existing conditions in San Francisco it- is going to
be an exceedingly dull month. We are not going .to have it dull with usâ we want to be
kept busy and keep our stock moving. We have taken a lot of good, up-to-date goods and
put them in at reductions that are sure to keep sales going here.
Our sale, which closed a week ago, \vas a successâ we sold everything almost down to
the last suit. So, to keep things going,, we have taken some single and double breasted fall
suits recently made up by us to sell for $12.50 and $15.00 and re- . -^
duced them to $7.85; also some $10.00 winter covert box coats &Wk

WOODLAND, Aug. 1.â During, the last
four or five months the claims against the
county on account of squirrel tail bounty
have been enormous and the suspicion of
fraud has been aroused. It has been the
custom to accept the count of the hunter
or to count a pile of a hundred and esti
mate the rest.
One day this week a claimant presented
a lot purporting to number 400O and re-
Quested * the County Clerk to certify to
the number. The County Clerk decided to
make a count, with the result that the lot
was 1625 short. There seems to. be no
doubt that the- Supervisors of this county
have been paying for the tails of thou

WOODLAND, Aug. j L-^-The entries for
the Woodland race meeting.: which 'com
mences on the 26th of August, have closed,
but will noi be announced until sufficient
time has elapsed for letters mailed in the
East on the last day of entry to have
arrived. The very best horses in the State
have . been â¢ entered, and the indications
are that the Fortieth Agricultural Fair
will be one of the best in the Sate.
Woodland Bace Entries Close.
At'l o'clock the first race was called. It
was the event known as the San Fran
cisco stakes. The entries and their odds
were: Tirado. 3 to 2; Cricrl, 2; Puerto
Rico. 3 to 2; Bolllver. 12, and Cyrene, 4.
Although the talent favored Puerto Rico,
Crid, a handsome daughter of Direct
(2:05%) and Cricket (2:10), experienced no
trouble In winning the race in three
straight heats. In 2:21%, 2:20 and 2:23%.
The favorite had to take second place in
the first two heats, while in the- last he
broke badly and Just saved his dlttance,
Bolllver taking second place. The winner
belongs to H. W. Meek of San Lorenzo
and is a half-sister to William Harold,
2:13.
The greatest enthusiasm prevailed In
the grand stand when the next event was
called. It was for the Sacramento Club
stakes. The horses were driven by their
owners and everybody could sec that
every man thought his horse should win.

sults, but It does not give an Idea of how
keen was the rivalry between these gen
tlemen to "win. Regina, ably handled by
Upson, was never headed and -won the
three heats In 2:19, 2:21% and 2:21. . Pansy
was a good fighting second until the last
heat, when Ruhstaller brought his re

"specials" of this kind will be allowed, al

Although the first â¢â¢ day of the season
was not auspicious, better, days are sure

hope for shooting success was freely
thought of and spoken.
The curious crowd on the last Sausalito
boat looked for specimens of the big
game. Two spiked horns were "all that
came cityward and they belonged to Al
Lehrke. He hunted at Murray's ranch
and did a day's good work. Out early in
the morning, he caught the game, three
shots bringing both deer to earth. On the
same boat were Achille Roos. Harry Hos
mer and George Jackson. "When Lehrke
told the story of his shoot the three
looked glummer than -pallbearers. They
had been in the saddle all day on the pre
serves of the Tamalpais Club. Roos was
the hero of the trio, for he bore the dis
tinction of having seen a fawn. The other
two simply enjoyed the natural beauties
of the landscape. '.. Â¦Â¦<
Marin County resounded with the bay
ing of hounds yesterday but very ' few
shots were fired at the red. game. The
Point Reyes Club inaugurated its season
by a general turnout. When the' shoot
began the party was augmented by Thom
as J. Walsh, Fred S. Johnson. George "W.
Smith, John C. Nobman, W. M. Cashman
and J. W. Crandall. "For five hours they
beat bush and thicket for the quarry, but
luck fell solely to Cashman's gun* A fair
sized buck was his portion. At the noon
hour lunch was served on the shore of
Trout Lake and in two colors of wine
neer, by timely throttle-reversing, avert
ed a head-on collision with a southbound
train. Then the special backed all the
way to Sausalito for a switch and the lo
comotive being thirsty at this time was
treated to a drink. Undaunted, a fresh
start was made. Smooth . sailing was en
joyed until Larkspur was scented. Again
progress received a sudden check, for an
other southbound train was met. This
time the special back-pedaled for only a
few miles and again the locomotive was
bathed in water. The third start carried
the excursionists to safe ports, "W. S. Kit

raids.
POINT REYES SPORTSMEN'S CLUB
LINED UP FOR ITS FIRST DEER
SHOOT.
HORSES RACE
IN TORRID SUN
THE opening of the deer season
reads like a story of promises un
fulfilled. Very little venison will
eoak In white wine to-day for the
delectation of the appetites of the
blacktail hunters and their friends. The
second day may bring its fruit but the
first "will linger long and poignantly in the
bit.ter minds of the enthusiastic eports
men. The first of August, so reads the
law, was set apart for the killers of deer
to wreak their vengeance. Few wreaked
and so the disgust is black and thick.
On "Wednesday the Country Club char
tered a special train from Sausalito to
Point Reyes. Without malice an invita
tion was extended to the Point Reyes
Sportsmen's Club to take advantage of
the golden opportunity and reach the
happy hunting grounds some three hours
In advance of the regular late afternoon
train. The Point Reyes sportsmen . re
sponded joyfully. On that train, which
consisted of two narrow-gauge cars, were
Alec Hamilton, Frank Carolan, Dr. de
Marville, Robert Oxnard. F. W. Van Slck
len, E. B. Prestcn, W. S. Kittle -. and
Andrew Jackson of the Country Club.
The Point Reyes Club was represented
by John Lemmer, General John H. Dick
inson, George W. Root, N. H. Hickman
and two guests. That all these "worthy
sportsmen are alive is no fault of the -
railroad. Sudden death stared them in the
face on two separate occasions of the trip
north and when they arrived at their des
tinations It was discovered that the reg
ular late afternoon train was hot on the
trail, not iiftee^ minutes behind.
AH eportsmen are full of signs and su
perstitions. This band Is loud in vehe
ment denunciation of the railroad for a
ruthless slaughter of first day chances.
This is how it happened. When the be
lated and water-loving locomotive pulled
out of the Sausalito shed with sportsmen,
dogs and rifles, cartridges and other am
munition It rolled on the wrong track.

COUNT LANGUISHES
IN A COUNTY- JAU,
EL RENO, O. T.. Aug. 1.â The drawing
of winning- numbers In the United States
land lottery was- concluded to-day, 13,000
of the envelopes having been taken from
the wheels, 6500 for each land district. The
crowd about the platform on which the
drawing took place was much smaller
than on previous days.
Beginning August 6, 125 names In each
district will be called daily for sixty days
for the filing of homestead entries. The
estimate Is made by a Government official
that in each land district 1000 of the 6500
numbers will,, not- be taken in the, sixty
days, because the homesteaders will be
disqualified, or will leave the country, be
lieving their claims to be worthless. This
will leave only 5500 persons who will make
entry in their respective districts. Two
thousand claims will be left for the wagon
emigrants and others who have been In
the Â¦ country for months and failed to
draw a number. At the end of the sixty
days, these persons can ;go Immediately
to their land office and file, or if they set
tle upon a homestead in advance of any
other person, they | . can remain thereon
three months before filing, their entry. Â¦
Homestead speculator's, who registered
for the sole purpose of selling their prize
if winners, are already seeking. to sell re
linquishments of their claims.

NEWPORT, R. I., Aug. Lâ The Inde-Â»
pendence. had. an opportunity j to-day to
show her mettle. Although defeated by
the Columbia," she was by no means dis
graced. Over a triangular ocean- course
of -.thirty miles, In a breeze light at tha
start and fresh at the finish, the Colum
bia beat her five minutes and fourteen
seconds, corrected time. The Columbia at
one-time was nearly half a mile In tho
lead, but as the wind freshened the In
dependence pulled up considerably. Then
came a run down the wind with a breeze
In the. starboard Quarter. The Independ
ence was left astern by the Columbia on
this leg.
. Fromlthe second mark to finish off Bren
ton's Reef lightship, it was a reach with
the wind a little before the port beam.
In this les the Independence did her best
work of the day. She gained one mJnuta
and forty-nine seconds. She was heeling:
over considerably at times and going very
fast. She sailed the last legr of the course,
ten nautical miles. In forty-five minutes
and- forty-five seconds, better than thir
teen knots an hour.
The Independence was measured by
John.Hyslop, the measurer of the New-
York Yacht Club, before she was towed
out of the harbor this morning. About
four tons of lead had been taken out of
her, consequently her water line length
was reduced to 88.03 feet, 14 inches less
than the . Columbia's. , ..- . - ..-,-'
Hy slop -figures out her racing length at
102.79 feet, and calculated that she must
allow Columbia 31 seconds over a thirty
mile course. Instead of tne 43 seconds she
was penalized 'In her previous races.'. % .:Â¦,

local craft of her size, and on Sunday,
July 28, she overhauled the sloops Thetis
and Siren easily, and even big boats like
the yawl Tramontana and the sloop
Speedwell had diHcult in shaking her off.
She will be sailed by her designer, builder
and owner. Commodore A. E. Chapman.
How she behaves in rough water is not so
certain, and as the race will take- place
over the regular course of the Corinthians
the challenged club is not preparing to
hand over the trophy just yet. The Corin

which is expected to take place on Satur
day, August 10, and will be under the joint

SAN FRANCISCO.
The German stickers obtained three
runs in the fourth round. Croll lead off
with a two-rbagger, Hildebrand following
his example, which enabled Croll to score.
Hildebrand advanced to third on
Schwartz's, out and scored on Krug's hit.
Nordyke. next up .fattened his batting av
erage--with another two-cushion swipe,
scoring Krug. â¢ â¢ ,
â¢ Three more of the Dutch made the cir
cuit during the sixth, by means of three
hits, a steal and a couple of errors.
To cap the climax, and incidentally to
add more .interest to the contest, Nor
dyke planted the ball over the center field
fence, bringing Schwartz in with him and
making the score even. Josh Reilly, wish
ing to change the situation, struck out.
It began to look like another long drawn
contest when Oakland took its last stand
in the ninth. Babbitt made a hit, but was
put out" at second on Hodson's attempted
sacrifice. Drennan got his third pass to
first. . : Pete Lohman came to . the rescue
at this stage with a clean two-base hit,
Hodson and Drennan coming home.
Charley Graham then made a very costly
error in trying to get Streib at first. Loh
man scoring and Streib going to second.
Krug threw wide, to Pabst, permitting
Streib, to come home. The bell rang four
times for the Brummels, who carried off
the spoils by a score of 10 to 6. The score:
- The .Â¦ unlucky; downtrodden Oakland
team, has good reason to rejoice,' as It
gave the leaders a decisive drubbing yes
terday. - And Hodson was in the box, a
coincidence which caused the fans to gy
rate with "-surprise. -
The Dudes took a good lead' in "the
first; Drennan got a pass; Lohman was
hit by the pitcher; Drennan was forced
out at third, "Truck" Egan coming to
the rescue with a clean hit, which brought
"Mother" Lohman' in. .'Before Evans
could -stop -'to', take his bearings Dunleavy
rolled out a' double, scoring Streib. Eag
an was caught at the plate, trying, to
score on Moskiman's drive to Krug. While
the doctor was stealing second Dunleavy
crossed the rubber with the third tally,
Arrellanes making the third out and re
tiring the side.

THE United States army transport
Lennox is drifting around some
where eff Port Harford under jury
rig. On Thursday. July 25, her
tail shaft broke and e% r er since the
steamship has been moving slowly down
the coast In a southeasterly direction. To
add to the unpleasantness of the situa
tion the Lennox Is short of provisions and
the men sent out in an open boat to bring
assistance state that the doctor was about
to order the slaughter of two horses in
order to get meat with which to make
broth for the sick. As for the soldier and
sailor passengers, they were catching
goonies and making soup out of them.
Two meals a day, and hard tack and
bacon at that, was what the Lennox's
passengers were lMnÂ£ on vrhen last
heard from.
The oil steamer George Loomis arrived
from Ventura yesterday towing behind
her a boat of the transport Lennox and
having on board seven of the passengers
and crew of the troop ship. Captain
George E. Bridgett made the following
report to the Merchants' Exchange:
"On July 31 at 7:45 p. m., in latitude
"5:42 north, longitude 121:26 west, picked
up a boat from the United States army
transport Lennox with the third officer in
charge and six men. They reported hav
ing left the Lennox at 9:30 a. m. that day
in latitude 35:40 north, longitude 121:55
west.
"They told me that on July 23, In lati
tude S7:40 north, longitude 127:28 west, at
5:15 p. m., the tail shaft broke during a
moderate northwest gale, accompanied by
a heavy seaÂ» Their boat therefore must
have made twenty-three and a half miles
from the time they left the ship until I
picked them up. They report all Â¦well on
board the Lennox but in want of assist
ance. At the time they left the ship the
leather was calm and hazy, with a mod
erate breeze from the northwest. The .ship
was drifting to the southeast." â¢
The men who brought the transport's
see the vessel away, but not the
rush there was when the Thomas went
out," as the Kilpatrick only carried a few
teachers. Those who went away on her
were:

DEAF AND DUMB
MUST BE TAUGHT
"Even with this spread we did not make
much progress and at that went steadily
to leeward. Wednesday we were 180 milek
south of San Francisco and forty miles
from land. . Captain Williamson ordered
the third mate to man a boat and go
ashore for assistance. The Chinese again
went on strike and the mate called for
volunteers. Six of us responded and away
we Â¦went, with no wind and under a blis
tering sun. Our course was northeast by
half east, and we rowed and saned for
twelve hours, finally raising Piedras
Blancas about 8 o'clock. Then the George
boat to port were Third Hate J. Spratt.
Frank West, J. P. Scanlon, P. T. Flaherty,
F. L. Rose, J. Lee and Dave Rankin. With
the exception of Mate Spratt all the men
were volunteers, as the Chinese crew ab
solutely refused to go in the boat. West,
Scanlon, Flaherty and Lee are time-ex
pired men-of-warsmen, Rankin is a Gov
ernment clerk and Rose is an artist.
"We were 300 miles off port when the ac
cident happened," said West yesterday,
"to the tail shaft. It was blowing pretty
strong and a heavy sea was running and
when the old ship got into the trough of
it she rolled considerable. Captain Wil
liamson ordered some sail set to steady
her, but the Chinese went to their berths
like rats and not a stroke of work could
be got out of them. The mate came for
ward and asked all that . were sailors
among the pasengers- to lend a hand.
Half a dozen of us went to worJfe and
with cargo booms and windsails we man
aged to get some *ail on her. Out of a
coaling boom we made a foretbpmast and
out of two cargo booms we made shift to
rig studding sails. When all was com
pleted we had the old craft under a jib
and staysail, foretopsail, foretopmast
staysail and trysail and maintopmast
staysail and trysail and two studding
sails.
Loomis came along and picked us up.
Captain Bridgett was very kind to us and
took care of us like the thorough Ameri
can gentleman he is. Allowing for her
continued southeast drift, I think ths
Lennox should now be about off Port
Harford and will probably be picked up
in the Santa Barbara channel.
"The Lennox left Manila with about
eighty passengers on June 27. We made
a stop at Nagasaki, leaving that port on
July 5. I don't know how it was in the
cabin, but back in the steerage the food
was fierce. Hardtack and beans, varied
with cracker hash, was our general fare,
and the day we broke down even that was
cut down to two meals a day. In the
cabin there was no fresh meat and in the
hospital there was a man down with dys
entery. The surgeon ordered him broth,
but there was no meat to make it with.
There were two horses aboard belonging
to cavalry officers now in the East, and
the doctor ordered one of them killed in
order to get the necessary meat. The
captain decided to hold out a day or two
longer in the hopes that assistance might
come. I guess by this time those horses
have been killed and eaten.
"As for the men in the steerage, they
caught and shot sea fowl and with them
made seagull soup. Well seasoned, it is
not bad and a hungry man would be
mighty glad to make a meal of it."
As soon as the news of the accident to
the Lennox reached the transport wharf
Captain Batchelder Issued orders to get
the tug Slocum ready for sea. She was
provisioned, coaled and supplies for the
Lennox put aboard In quick time, and by
2p. m. she was on her way to sea. Cap
tain Frazer of the transport Sherman
went out along with Captain Marshall.
They hope to pick the Lennox up this
afternoon and get back to San Francisco
to-morrow.

JAMES J. HILL of the Great Northern railway
system has become one of the most pronounced
adyocates of a comprehensive scheme of reclaim
ing the arid lands of the West. He has recently
to interest Chicago in the'enterprise by telling
the people of that city that if the arid lands.be re
claimed the Pacific Coast will soon have^a popula
tion of 20,000,000 and Chicago will be the metropolis
of the world.
Mr. Hill's argument is a simple one. There are, he '
says, something like 400,000,000 of people in Asia
with whom we can open trade relations. Those peo
ple are not civilized and care little for manufactured
goods' in large quantities; moreover, most of the
people are too po'or to buy anything costly, or of for
eign make/ -Their desire is mainly for foodâ that is,
wheat, corn and fruit. .' Such supplies can be most
economically shipped from the western side of the
American Union.' If, therefore, the Government pro-'
mote the reclamation of the arid lands we can fur
nish Asia with the food supplies for, her people and
thus obtain something like a domination of Asiatic
commerce.
In developing, his theory he recently stated to a :
correspondent of the Chicago Tribune: "People re
gard with amazement the present rapid growth of
wealth in the United States, but this will be compara
tive poverty when with twenty million people on the.
Pacific Slope engaged in raising grain andmanufac-;
turing flour for the Orient we can dispatch large
freighters daily from each of the Pacific ports loaded
with the manufactured goods of the Eastern factories'
the cotton. of, the South, and the food products of 'Â¦
the mountain, valleys.- Then a river of wealth will be
turned into the United , States, which .will put to
shame the t visions of the wildest dreamers. If Con
gress at its next session" will appropriate. $100,000,000
in 2 per cent bonds to, be used in canal and. reservoir
construction, the money will be returned directly
many times in the increase and-value of the public
land." Indirectly, in trade results, the benefits will be
permanent and. incalculable." â¢

WEDDING INVITATIONSâ F.. H." O.
City, i A writer on etiquette says In regarc
to invitations to weddings: "No answers
are necessary. People living at a distance
receiving invitations enclose their cards
and send by mail. Those . who cannot at
tend, send or leave their cards for thÂ«
hostess within a few days after the wed
ding." An announcement " that ' a couple
are engaged should be answered by a let
ter of congratulation to the one sending
such announcement.
It is said that- Paul Kruger* will go back to his
South African home in October. He should have a

POLL. TAX EXEMPTIONâ G. H... S., r
Orange, Cal. The fact that a man Â¦who is
21 "years v and over; has not registered
and does not vote does not exempt him
from the payment of poll tax. The only
male inhabitants in 'the State who* are
exempt are: "Paupers, Idiots, insane per
sons, Indians not . taxed and those " who
are over GO years of age." ,
" The movement for the improvement of the chan
nel should begin at once. Under the terms of' the
contract the stone drydock is to be completed within"
thirty-six months, and the contractors are quoted as
saying they will' have it ready in thirty By
that time the channel should be deepened. We can
never have a better time to make the fight for the
Channel appropriation than' right now, for the pres
ent administration has shown -itself favorable : to ; the
Mare Island yard, but we do not'know how the next
one will.be. \ Â» . -Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
.The Call has repeatedly directed attention to. the
impprtance of the Mare Island Navy-yard, . has stead-,
fastly championed every effort made to impress that
importance upon, the officials at Washington, and
consequently shares the general gratification over the
â¢signing. of the contract for the dock. At the present
time there are not anything like adequate'* facilities
for repairing our war. vessels on this coast, and what
has been done to 'extend the facilities at Mare Island
is therefore in the nature of an action that has long
been imperatively required. When the new one is
completed Mare Isiand will have "two of ' the finest
docks in the world and .will be able to carry out :
repairs on the largest of our warships now afloat. .
Â¦ That much having been achieved, the next step is
to procure from Congress the appropriation required
to dredge the. shoal and clear the channel; To that
end the efforts of California . Congressmen should
now be, directed, and they should have ample assist-,
ance from the merchants and other influential men of
San Francisco. While" the navy-yard is of importance
to all California, it is especially so to this city, and
our citizens should take a keen interest in everything
that concerns its use and development.
MARE ISLAND NAVY- YARD is to have at
last the recognition due from the Govern
ment at Washington. The officials of the
Navy Department have signed the contract for the
construction of the great drydock which for so long
a time has been under consideration, and that will
naturally and inevitably lead to the improvement of
the channel so 'that the largest vessels of the navy can
reach the dock without difficulty.
MAKE ISLAND YARD.
THEM AND THEY-A., City. "Them"
being the objective case of the pronoun
"they," In the sentence submitted it Is
correct to u^e "them," namely: - "Told the
self-righteous people that the publicans
and the women would enter into the'king
dom before them." In another <. form it
would be correct to say: "to enter into
the kingdom before they did."
King Edward does not talk so much like a medieval
war lord as Kaiser William, but he is reported to be
showing so much of a desire to revive old-time pomp
and custom the British are coming to believe he
would be an old-time monarch in every respect if he
had only a chance.
BANKRUPTCT-L. V., City. In order
to become a bankrupt under the Federal

necessary that he should be a resident of

is this pasturage destroyed, but the tracts lower

Government is too new to have been thoroughly dis

which commend themselves to those interested in trie

such frequent occurrence on the ranges of late can

CHARLES JONES, who was once amateur champion
bicycle 'rlder r of New Zealand and . Australia, has ac
complished the most marvelous feat on record, and his
exhibitions are now the talk of all London, says the
New Tork World: .
He rides on the steepest, narrowest and smallest track in
the worldâ it is only eighteen feet in diameterâ on a road racing
bicycle which is geared at 80, and while doing: so himself and
machine are practically in a horizontal position. Moreover, he
removes Â»hls handle bar and balances his bicycle entirely with
his legs' and ankle motion 1 .
It is hard to give any adequate idea in words of the amazing
daring- of this achievement, for the track itself risea from the
stage at an angle of about sixty degrees, and oscillates con
stantly while the cyclist rushes round it. This is necessary on
account of the impact caused by the impetus of the machine,
Â¦which is calculated to be at least two tons! The part of it
which faces the audience is grilled so that those sitting below
the stage can see the rider as well as those who look down on
him from above.
Jones first gives a demonstration of his absolute control
over the machine while pedaling at top speed, and prove*
that he does not remain on the track by centrifugal force. He
goes once round on the stage, and directing his front wheel
suddenly toward the track he rides full tilt, and In the f raction,
of a second he Is seen whirling round it at the topmost speed.
The oscillation of the track makes it resemble somewhat a
huge concertina being expanded and compressed.
When in full 'career Jones discards his handle bars, flings
'out his arms and ths spectators hold their breath. It Is tha
most thrilling performance Imaginable.
"When Jones ends his act he still has to, wheel four times
around the small track before he can slow down sufficiently td
pedal off the track to the stage asrain. The daring rider fre
quently springs from his wheel while it is going at full speed
in order to avoid any possible accident.
In addition to this feat Jones rides around the track seated
sidesaddle, dons shirt, collar, coat, etc., while going at full speed,
and then lights a cigarette.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES?
Only two days remain in which- registration can
take place. The duty must be attended to to-day or
to-morrow. It is no longer possible to delay further.
The question is now up to every citizen whether, he
will forfeit his franchise and thus serve the bosses, or
whether he will register and vote, with the people.
Registration closes to-morrow.
The issue before the people is that of saving San
Francisco politics from degradation and the municipal
government from the control of corrupt men. That
issue will be determined for this election mainly at
the^ Republican primaries. It is a foregone conclu
sion that if Republicans surrender their nominating
convention to the bosses they will have no chance of
carrying the city, and consequently, every interest of
the party and of the city. urges genuine Republicans
to register and .make sure of \ their right to vote
against the bosses when the election takes place.
The new primary law gives to this election a char
acter far different from that of the former primaries.
It will not be dominated by bosses and their gangs.
Honest men have now a chance to cast an honest
ballot -and have it honestly counted. The bosses are
aware of that fact and have been straining every
energy and every faculty they possess to get upon

strong to outvote decent citizens at the polls. In
that effort they will be overwhelmingly defeated if
the people do their duty. The only thing' that can
give the predatory politicians a victory is a spirit of
indifference on the part of the better elements of the
people toward their civic responsibilities. . If any con

the business men and the professional men go to the

Factions in the navy may enjoy that way of getting
even, but the people .of this country resent the offi
cial sophistication of their history, .and will not
have it:: : ".;;,- / '
When a man's grievance has been made a political
issue, even his own judgment, he must wait
until some act of his fool enemies has offset that of
his fool friends. Schley has not waited in vain. Â¦ His
enemies have attacked him through Maclay and
given him the opportunity he desired. Maclay's lan
guage is so intemperate,. indecent and so far removed
from that which any man of -good sense would use
in writing history that the country is inclined to de
mand not only that. Schley get whatever vindication
there is in the facts, but that Laborer Maclay be can
celed off the payroll and kicked into private life.
â¢ Admiral Schley has been the victim of several cir
cumstances over which he had no control. He had
the misfortune to be made an issue by Colonel Bryan
in his Presidential campaign. The political' colonel
did not care a straw about the merits of the issue,
but Schley is a Marylander, that State was behind
him, its electoral vote was in doubt, and Bryan
wanted it. So he put in Schley in issue there â and
failed. to carry Maryland. This was taken as a rebuke
to the admiral; when the fact was that not a dozen
voters in. Maryland cared who was the hero or who
the coward of Santiago. They were voting upon
other questions entirely. This action of Colonel
Bryan harmed Schley, yet he did not procure it, nor
could he have prevented it. - â¢ ,
But wherever there occurred cause for controversy,
as at the naval battle of Santiago, the strife has
raged with a fury not known in the personal disputes
of the old navy, although they often led to sanguinary
duels. . . ';Â¦; .'Â¦?:. â¢Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦
In justice to all parties', however, it must be re
membered that we did not know the weak military
condition of Spain until after her incapacity for re
sistance had been tested and demonstrated. We took
no chances and wisely prepared in advance for any
emergency, and could have won against a resistance
many fold greater than our valetudinarian enemy was
able to put up. ', v
There has been a well intended effort to let the
Sampson-Schley controversy wear itself out. The
country did not wish to arbitrate between the two
officers, r.or to sit in judgment upon either. ; To tell
the plain truth about it, the general judgment is that
from the military standpoint the Spanish war was
not such an achievement as deserves all the brag made
about it. ' Its results are of high c significance, but
Spain as a military power was in such hopeless - de
cay that to whip her seemed almost an act of cruelty.
Where she had guns she had no powder, and where
powder no guns. Where she had both together she
had no gunners. There was not even powder enough
to fire an official salute at many of her . important Â«
colonial stations. The one joke of , the brief and
grim and unpleasant little war occurred at Guam.
When an American cruiser appeare'd off that capital
and fired at the petty citadel the hostile demonstra
tion'was mistaken by the Spanish Governor for a
salute. He had not heard that Spain and the United
States were at war. Dressing himself in full uniform,
he* embarked with his staff to explain to the American
commander that he could not return the salute be
cause his Government did not 'supply, him with pow
der! To' his astonishment he was made a prisoner
and carried off without being permitted to return to
his house for a clean shirt.
The navy is not without writers of repute. Mahan's
"Sea Power" has put him in the front rank of naval
writers of any age, and it is not the only work of
his pen. Captain Robley D. Evans, the "Fighting
Bob" of the service, writes as well as he fights, and
there are others. Just why Maclay, the pot boiler, a
civjlian, by official designation a laborer in Brooklyn
navy-yard, came to be made official historian is some
thing the country wants to know about, if it is per
fectly convenient for. those who can to' tell.
The American army has a history, too, though we
are not aware that it has ever been officially written.
If it were, and thj; work were done by some man em
ployed and carried on the payroll as post hostler, the
country would be surprised.
THE press of the country very naturally wants
to know why a pot boiler, carried ori~ the pay
roll as a navy-yard laborer, is entrusted with the
writing of the official history of the United States
navy, to be used as a text" book in the naval
academy.

tinkering with the problem Mr. Hill has no sympathy.'
He says : "A Â¦ policy; of- arid land reclamation' to' be
effective must be conducted on a large scale. An ap-'
propriation of only $1,000,000 would bechildish/ Two
hundred and- fifty; million dollars was voted without
discussion for the_Spanish war. This was for waste;
In^these days of large undertakings an expenditure" of
$100,000,000 for a permanent improvement which -will
benefit millions of people should not cause hesitation.
Such an amount, properly used, would add $3,000,000,
000 to the national wealth. While it would .make
homes for a multitude of settlers, the greatest bene
fits would come to the manufacturers of the, Eastern
and- Middle Western States and their employes, and
to the cotton raisers and spinners of the South." --
.The advocacy of a man like James J. Hill is' worth
something to any "enterprise, and the supporters of
arid land reclamation will gladly welcome him to their
ranks. ; His prediction that ' such a" policy will make
Chicago, . r the metropolis of the world may . be dis
puted, for there is no reason why that city, should
grow.Cmbre than others because of an expansion of
our commerce' with the Orient. The effect upon Pa
cific Coast cities, however,' would' certainly | be great,
and, when once the work of reclamation had, become
fairly launched. it would probably not be long before
this coast actually attained the population of 20,000,
000, which Mr. Hill predicts.

square miles. This timber is usually found
at an altitude of between 5500 and 7500
feet. The total quantity of pine timber fit

WHEN asked shortly after the Ohio Demo

Pennsylvania would deal with the political

eplied: "There is no political situation this year,
tnd the Democrats of Pennsylvania will not try to
nake one. Their State platform will be- confined: to
The policy thus outlined has been adopted in Mary
and in advance of Pennsylvania action. The astute
ilr. Gorman arranged everything beforehand and
nade matters about as harmonious as they can be in

)ver the country and has discerned no. political situa
5on for the Democrats to deal with, and his party
vill go into the fight with banners blazoned with
my and every kind of a motto calculated to catch
Â»otes.
In the meantime a situation is shaping itself in
Dhio. Despite Bryan's refusal to give aid to a move
nent among the radicals to bolt the ticket and the
>latform put up by the Democratic party, a number
)f stalwart silver men have decided to make the is
â¢ue and to take an appeal to the people. They have
irganired under the title, "The Progressive Demo
ratic Party," have adopted a platform laudatory of
3ryan, reaffirming the Kansas City platform and de
nanding public ownership of all public utilities and
hat all money of whatever kind shall be issued di
ectly by the Government and without the interven

ThcTbolters are not likely to. amount to much, but
hey serve to show that the situation is riot altogether

nay be more astuteness shown in dodging the issues

â¢e seen whether the dodging' can be done effectively.

hat this is his last chance to win' a political victory,

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
Driver Hall, with an abiding faith in the
truth of the maxim that discretion is a
heap more valuable than valor in such
cases, waited for no second order, but
stopped the stage with a jerk that nearly
lifted the five passengers from their seats.
The robber advanced toward; the ve
hicle and told the passengers to climb out.
They were quick to respond and lined up
on the road alongside the stage. - The
bandit then suggested that they throw
out their coin. It ' was not an opulent
quintet, for the sum total of the high
wayman's winnings was only $5. After
commenting disparagingly on 'the miser
able financial condition of -his victims, he
ordered them back to the wagon and di
rected Hall to drive on and hurry ! up
about it. - Â¦
Hall whipped up his horses and made
haste to Potter Valley, where he in/ormed
the officers.-. He said ,the robber, was- the
same man who held up his stage a week
ago. -Evidently the bandit had hoped .to
catch the Blue Lakes stage again, but it
was late and he did not wait to molest the
passengers on It. Sheriff Smith and a
number of deputies are now searching for
the highwaymnn.
UKIAH, Aug. 1.â As the northbound
stage to Potter Valley was swinging
around a curve on the road about one mile
north of, Fort Brown and within -half a
mile of the place where it was robbed
about a week ago," a -lone highwayman
stepped out from the shelter of a clump
of trees and commanded Raymond Hall,
the driver, to pull up his team. The ban
dit was masked and nonchalantly fingered
the trigger of a shotgun. -'<; .

tion of his action in giving an interview
to the press, in. which he strongly de
fended his father. The Interview was
published on Monday, last. Captain Schley
is stationed at Fort Douglas, Utah, and
he took occasion to declare that some
startling facts would be brought to light
if the whole truth should become known.
He stated that hetiad advised his father
to withhold none of the facts in his pos
session about Admiral Sampson or any
one else. He charged the Navy Depart
ment with having suppressed a letter
written by Sampson to Schley, directing
the latter to remain off Cienfuegos, and
added that his father had several strong
cards up his slee.ve.
While the War Department does not de
sire to become involved in the naval con
troversy, it regards Captain Schley's ac
tion as a breach of army regulations,
which prohibit an officer from publicly
discussing . service ' matters or private
transactions, and declare that respect- to
superiors must be extended on all occa
sions. Admiral Sampson is, of course, in
directly Captain Schley's superior. The
department holds that as the Secretary
of the Navy has taken measures- to pre
vent naval officers from talking, It is no
more than right that it. should take like
action. In view of these considerations,
Acting Secretary Sanger directed Colonel
Thomas Ward, acting adjutant general,
to send an official letter to Captain Schley,
inviting his attention to the alleged in
terview, a clipping of which was inclosed,
and requesting him to submit to the de
partment any remarks in explanation
thereof he might desire to make.- If Cap
tain Schley admits that he authorized the
interview, his attention will be called to
the army regulations, he will be forbidden
to make further statements in regard to
the matter and he will probably be cen
sured. ' . â¢

Sheriff Sibley says he â¢ does not know
what to believe from the many stories
about the trouble. Woodruff was certain
ly shot by some ' one. The officers are
looking for Ward. The Sheriff says the
snooting could hardly have occurred
where Woodruff says it did and the ladies
not hear it. He is inclined to believe that
Woodruff followed Ward and that the
shooting occurred at another place. Wood
ruff is not seriously hurt.
Miss Hedwig Rosenbaum stated to-day
that when the party came almost up to
Ward and the woman Woodruff . rode
on ahead. Woodruff and "Ward were quar
reling. They saw a pistol in Ward's hand.
STOCKTON. Aug. 1.â S. A. Woodruff,
manager of the Fashion Stables, was shot
last evening while out riding and consid
erable mystery surrounds the affair. The
man who fired the shot is said to be
Henry "Ward, who had a quarrel on the
road with Woodruff.
About dusk the Misses Rosenbaum,
daughters Â©fa local banker, and a lady
friend, secured saddle horses. Woodruff
accompanied them to be of service in case
the animals became unmanageable. On
the Cherokee Lane the - stableman came
across Ward and a woman, both on sad
dle horses. Woodruff, who owned one of
the horses, rode forward and some inqui
ries he made precipitated a row, during
which, he declares, he received a pistol
ball wound in the head. The Misses Ro
senbaum declare that they heard no stiot,
but saw the man and Â¦woman pursuing
Woodruff down the road. They in fright
turned and rode hastily to town.

"Mrs. Dane's Defence," is Miss Ethel

left California 'some few years ago to
study elocution in Boston, earning there,
afterward, a very considerable reputation

MYSTERY VEILS
THE SHOOTING
The society proposes to erect a modern
hospital in place of the present wooden
building on the block â¢ bounded by Noe,
Castro, Ridley and Fourteenth- streets.
The specifications call for the erection of
administration, medical, surgical and fe
male operating departments and private
wards. In addition to the business offices,
living apartments for the medical staff
and nurses, the new hospital iwill include
separate buildings for infectious cases.
The general medical department will
contain forty-eight beds; the general
surgical department Is to accommodate
forty-four patients; the female depart
ment will be equipped with forty beds,
while the private wards will be' able to
takf care of thirty-six patients. Special
attention is to be given to the operating
department, .the specifications calling- for
two aseptic operating rooms and one sep
tic operating . J room. Commodious sunny
rocms are to be erected in the building
and a complete X-ray room will be fitted
up. The hospital Is to be lighted with. gas
and electricity. A feature of the new hos
pital will be the isolation of patients suf
fering from tuberculosis. The total cost
of the new hospital is to be $250,000. and
it is estimated that it will re.quire $30,000
more to eauip the building.
The following prizes will be awarded to
the four designs which the hospital build
ing committee shall consider as answer
ing the requirements: First prize, $2000;
second prize. $1000; third prize. $750, and
fourth prize, $500. The building commit
tee consists of I. Gutte, B. Broemmel,

decision of the committee is expected to
be made public in about three weeks. â¢

PRECIOUS PLUM
FOR SYNDICATE
Miss Logan was sworn, and denied that
she i had ever presented her diamond ring,
valued at i $150, . to Lewis. She lent : it to
him, she said, and when she demanded its
return he refused to give it to her. The
-stock Lewis had given her was a present,
and for her mother's sake she did not
care to return it to him, although it was
worthless. The Judge advised her to re
turn the stock~lf it was worthless and get
back her ring, but her attorney, Arthur
Brand, said he did not believe that Lewis
could return the, ring.
Mrs. Waldron stated under oath that
she had given Lewis altogether $1450 to in
vest in oil stock on the statement by him
that the stock was worth more than she
had paid for it, and all that she had got
from him was $38. She had also given him
$600, which he had promised to invest for
her in some paying security, but she had
reason to believe that it had never been
so invested, and she had failed to get him
to return the amount.
The Judge -ordered a subpena to be is
sued for Lewis to appear In court thifl
morning, and said that upon hi* failure
to appear or give a satisfactory expla
nation as to the ring and his dealinga
with Mrs. Waldron, , ne would issue the
warrants.
Judge Mogan â¢ has not yet issued the
warrants for the arrest of Paul Redfield
Lewis, oil' stock broker, on charges of fel
cny; embezzlement and obtaining ' money
by false pretenses. Yesterday at 11 o'clock
/was set as the time for Miss Ai da Logan
and her mother," Mrs." Harriet A. Waldron,
639 O'Farrell- street,^ who seek Lewis' ar
rest, and Lewis to appear before the court
and state their cases. Attorney Gibson,
on .behalf of Lewis, said his client was
sick and -could" hot be ' present, but -he
handed the Judge a statement of accounts
between Mrs. Waldron and Lewis. In
which Mrs. Waldron. was shown to be in
debted to Lewis to the extent of $72.83.

NEW YORK. Aug. 1.â To-day's break in
price when tradinc was commenced on the
Etock Exchange seemed to be one of the usual
fluctuations of a. narrow professional market
and was characteristically lacking In any
neve to explain it. There was some revision
;f sentiment araont the traders in accord with
the new movement, but this was as much an
effect as cause of the changed course prices.
Having Fold ptocks fcr three days without any
active participation on the part of the outside
public In the market the room traders ' began
to feel that their short lines were getting un
comfortably extended and they proceeded to
buy stocks to cover. The steel stocks com
manded the principal attention and rebounded
sharply from yesterday's depression There
was no news of any change in the status of
the strike negotiations when the market
Dp3Tie<J. but the traders had come to the con
:!usion that th*=y were unduly pessimistic over
. the pwr*ct of a settlement when they sold
Hies* rtocks down yesterday afternoon, so they
oourht back what they had sold. The recov
ery in those stocks had a dominant infiuenc
Â»n thÂ» rest of the list and on ppeculative sen
timent in reneral. In seeking for a bull argu
ment to move prices in the new direction the
r?cent rtrenrth of Norfolk and Western and
sther bituminouB coal carriers offered a lead
That proup of stocks was accordingly bought
*nd bid up by traders and the movement
tpread to the anthracite road. The movement
teemed to bs based on the general considera
.Icn of the sound conditions In the trade and
:he periodical advance of 10 cents per ton in
:he price of anthracite which goes into effect
:o-4ay..
The distribution of dividends and Interest
to-day. Includinr that on Government bonds
ras looked to to provide pome demand for rel
nvntment. The continued advance this morn
ng in rterllng exchange eeeraeil to foreshadow
lorr.e cutso of eold, and this possibility was a
â¢epresuive influence on speculation. The Bterl
n;Â» exchange rate now stands at the point at
â¢rhlch the last grold was exported. The high
wt nr!e*s rrcnerally were made before noon,
trd the ai solute failure to attract any out
ride buying prompted the professionals to sell
rat their holdings again and take their profit*,
ftiw* was no more news to account for the re
tction than there was ' to explain . the early
New York Stock Market.

Provisions were i again dull | and featureless,
but prices advanced on buying by packers. Sep
tember pork closed 32%c higher, lard 5c up and
ribs 7%c improved.* :
â¢ The leading futures ranged as follows:.',
Oats were handled ' in liberal quatltles, but
feeling was bearish or bullish, according to the
feeling in the corn pit. September closed %@
%c hieher at 34%c.
Wheat was moderately active. September
opened %@%c lower at 68V4c to 68%c, under the
influence of perfect weather In the Northwest
and easy cables. In sympathy with corn there
was a rally to 68%@6S%c, but the bears were
confident and a decline to 67%@67%c followed.
During the afternoon, . following a period of
dullness, the cash demand j Improved, and this,
combined with sympathy with corn, caused an
advance and the market closed firm,' sfcc higher
at Â£9c. . i
CHICAGO, August 1.â Corn, opened dull but
firm because of damage claims from the West
and also because -no more rain was reported.
One Icwa message predicted an eighth of a crop
for portions of that State, while farmers were
being advised to cut up their crop now for fod
der rather than accept the flimsy chance of an
Improvement of the situation. Following the
opening there was considerable selling, largely
by bears who anticipated liquidation In conse
quence of the temporary suspension of the
Phillips commission house. During this period
the market was at its poorest. Later shorts
became alarmed at the fact that the expected
liquidation had not come and this, together
with reports of additional crop damage, caused
a sharp rally and the close was strong at the
best mark of the day. September closed 2%@
2%c over yesterday at the latter figure.

The various aspects ot the matter are
being investigated by several"school di
rectors with the view of presenting the
subject to the board at an early date.
The argument Is advanced by those who
favor the project that these children who
only suffer the lack of the sense of hear
ing should be given opportunity for the
"special training which their cases de
mand. A scientific system is employed,
that of lip movement, by which the deaf
child can readily be taught. It is this
method which is being used for the class
now being handled here.
This success is the mainspring of the
movement which those Interested have
started toward the establishment of a
class of such afflicted children In connec
tion with the work of the public schools.
Because of their affliction the children
could not be given the training of the
public schools and they were not eligible
for admission into the State Institute for
the Deaf and Dumb and Blind, a3 they
could articulate. The parents were ; ex
tremely anxious that their offspring
should be given an education and the re
sult was the formation of the class which
has been in successful operation for some
time.
The class numbers seven pupils, all of
whom are afflicted with total deafness,
but are otherwise possessed of their nat
ural faculties. The parents secured per
mission from the Board of Education to
use the room which Â¦ was not In service.
There these children were assembled and
they have been educated under the direc
tion of an expert teacher, at the expense
of the parents.
The Board of Education has under con
sideration a project to establish a class
in the public school for the training of
deaf children. The suggestion has been
made to several directors, who have the
matter under consideration. It is the re
sult of work which is now being done
with a class of deaf pupils under private
instruction at a room in the Oakland
High School building.

come teachers may take an ex-post grad

on account of ill health, and is now trav

to Japan, to which country she is going

Hughes to write an j official report along
the lines of her observations in Japan. .
Mrs. Emma Shatter Howard accompa
nied Miss Hughes on a tour of inspection
of the University grounds and buildings
yesterday, and this morning the distin
guished visitor was present at Dr. Rus
sell's lecture on coeducation in the Hall
of Philosophy. Miss Hughes was request
ed to address the assembly, and as she
and Dr. Russell differ- somewhat In their
views of eaual education, her. remarks
were full of interest. Aliss Hughes- said
that women should be on the governing
boards of all colleges, in order that the
curriculum might be broadened and the
needs of women be understood and met.
She also said that we were behind the
times In that respect in this countryâ
that in Wales and England on all such
boards, where i all' else was equal, women
were preferred.' ' â¢ -Â¦ -. :
MisH Hughes waa very much interested
in Mrs. Hearst's house for home Indus
tries, which she says is the only institu
tion of the kind in the world.
The eminent educationist is a warm
advocate of State universities, and had
nothing but nraise for the University of
California. She confessed to a disappoint
ment in. the buildings, but was delighted
with the great number of acres surround
ing them.

"There is no curse in the American
public school system as great as this lack
of preparation on the part of teachers.
If we are to make a step forward we
must have a more thorough going and a
more finished scholarship than ever be
fore. "We as teachers must take hold of
this question and put our profession
where it belongs. We must fight agatnat
incompetent teaching as malpractice in
fought against in surgery. Teachers of
the future must be more fitted for the
work professionally and scholastically."
Professor Ewald Flugel of Stanford ad
dressed the meeting on the "Humor of
Chaucer." Professor T. R. Bacon, dean
of the summer session, presided and said
farewell to the summer students.
"On the part of many teachers there
is a lack of ability to do the work we are
expected to do. We are not as a. class
fitted to do the work. We know it. but
we must confess that we would rather it
â¢would go no further than these four
walls. We as teachers have many. faults.
We haven't sufficient command of the
Instruments used in our schools: we don't
know enough of the subjects we are
teaching. We take up the work the day
after we auit being scholars. -
"We teachers as a class are the most
bigoted and narrow-minded set of, peo
ple of which I know who are engaged In
anything like a profession. We spend our
lives always looking down. 'The lawyer
finds himself against men his equal and
many times his superior and his wits are
being constantly sharpened. He is being
constantly subjected to criticism, but It
broadens him and lengthens him and
deepens him. The business man. the phy
sician and the minister find themselves
in very much the same position. The
teacher in the country all alone day after
day with only little children becomes nar
rower and narrower. It is a life hard, to
bear because of a lack of association to
inspire. It Is very much the same In the
cities, especially where teachers are
specialists in certain subjects. The rut
is worn deeper and deeper every day and
under the circumstances I wonder that
one ever gets out of it. â¢
Professor Russell is a teacher of .teach
ers and an acknowledged authority on all
things pertaining to teaching. Among
other things he said:
BERKELEY. Aug. 1.â James E. Ruh

pared to do the work required of them.
His criticism was delivered before, the
closing general meeting of the University
of California summer session held in Har

posed almost entirely of teachers of this
State. He declared against the faults of
Instructors and urged upon them the
necessity of uplifting the intellectual
standard of their calling. He spoke also
of the difficult conditions under which

HIS Broadway, Aug. L
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
Thp Superintendent 'Sand the Directors
feel hopeful that the warfare which has
been waged at Claremont will be stilled.
When that school was operated on the
district . plan the two factions fought
about every detail of the school's admin
istration. The teacher was the center of
the trouble. In addition to her difficul
ties of administration she was compelled
to board around among the neighbors, the
school being too remote from the thickly
settled residence districts to permit her
to travel to and fro daily. It was ac
counted a hard school. That is why the
Directors dodgred the issue. ..-. Â¦
But this did not provide for Miss Bliss,
who was entitled to - draw v salary, al
though every class in the department had
been filled. Monday the rush of pupils
began. It swelled the records of the Oak
land School Dppartment as â¢Â¦ never -before.
Tuesday and "Wednesday saw little dimin
ution in the applicants for seats. By
Wednesday the Superintendent saw his
way clear. He ordered , the formation of
a new class at the Lafayette School and
Miss Bliss was appointed to handle the
pupils. So everybody is content and the
board is relieved of its embarrassing pre
dicament. . V
Miss Grace E. Bliss 1 Is the instructor In
question. She had been teacher at the
Claremont School, recently annexed to
the Oakland department. There had'been
a factional fight at Claremont and mat
ters .were decidedly upset. When the
school was made a portion of the Oak
land department the Board of Education
was confronted with a problem.. Â¦ They
had elected Miss Bliss as a teacher, but
had failed to assign her to any class.
Last Friday, when' the Directors made
the allotments of teachers for the present
term. Miss Bliss was. left in the air. The
Claremont School was unprovided with a
teacher and the Directors dodged the is
sue.. They did. not want any of their
friends sent out there, and after wrestling
with the knotty problem for two hours,
causing a temporary deadlock in the
classification, the Directors finally passed
the perplexing question up to-Superin
tendent McClymonds for settlement.' He
gave the board- fair warning. Â¦
"If vou do not elect a teacher for the
Claremont Srhcol, I will assign the first
teacher on the preferred I list to that
school."' said the Superintendent. Ho
made his word good, and Mrs. Ruth Me-
Clellan. the leading candidate on that
list, now holds the position of teacher at
the Claremont School.
The rush of children to the public
schools has saved the" Board .of Educa
tion and City Superintendent of Schools
McClymonds from the perplexing trouble
of making a place for a teacher who; by
a peculiar : chain of circumstances, was
thrown on the hands of the department.

Southern Pacific Tribu
tary in Arizona De-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Aug. 1.â Rain and
wind storms created great havoc along
the lines of the Southern and Northern
Arizona railroads last night. Never In the
past twenty years have storms of such
severity visited Arizona as raged along:
the line of, the Southern Pacific and its
tributaries.
The Gila Valley and Globe railroad
tributary to the Southern Pacific system
was virtually washed out of ex
istence. A big cloudbust below
Globe washed away five miles of
track and only in a few spots is any off
the foundation of the -roadbed left In Its
place. Stages have been put into use be
tween Tucson and Nogales and Globe, and
it will be weeks before traffic on. the rail
roads can be resumed. The damage will
not fall short of $400,000, and the loss of.
traffic will put the total at $5PO,000.
For over 100 miles south Into Mexico
nearly- all the railroads are disabled, and
thousands of cars of perishable freight
are waylaid with no possibility of saving
them. In Northern Arizona the Santa
Fe. Prescott and Phoenix road was
washed out for several miles, and ths.
wind caused severe damage. The Glla
and Salt rivers are both out of their
banks, as are all of the smaller creeks
and rivers in the mountains.
CARDINAL GIBBONS TALKS
OF PAPAL APPOINTMENTS
Intimates That Archbishops Ireland
and Corrigan "Will Be Made
Princes of the Church.
LONDON, Aug. 2. â The Dally Express
published an interview yesterday with
Cardinal Gibbons, which it prefaces thus:
"At present his is the only red hat In
the United States; but in a conversation
with a representative of the Dally Ex
press he intimated that the Pope intended
making Archbishop Ireland and Arch
bishop Corrigan prlnctvj of the -church."
Cardinal Gibbons is also represented as
saying:
"The Pope is sure that Washington will
do justice to the church In the Philippines.
He regards the United State3 as one of
the great strongholds of Catholicism, and
it will have greater weight hereafter in
Vatican councils.
"The Pope is convinced that the gath
ering of population into towns and cities
is one of the greatest menaces to religion
in the new- century, as rural populations
are hapo'er and healthier in body, mind
and morals."

Modern science has discovered that dan-

scalp In scales as it burrows down to the
roots of the hair, where it destroys the
hair's vitality, causing falling hair and.

failed until the great laboratory discovery
was made which resulted In Newbro's

SAN JOSE, Aug. l.-Attorney O. O.
Felkner, who yesterday was charged with
felony embezzlement by John Down, was
arrested at Santa Cruz this morning and
will be brought here to-morrow.' About
a .year aco Felkner borrowed 9580 from
Down and in return ! gave a promissory
note, with a mortgage for $675 held by his
wife, Eunice Felkner. against Arthur L.
Penniman. When Down wanted his money
he found that his security in the. shape
of the mortgage was worthless, as Mrs.
Felkner had collected it a few days after
he was given the papers. The mortgage
was satisfied on the record. Felkner when
arrested was attending the Christian
Church convention, of which church he
was formerly a minister.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
About the only excitement visible- was
the unusual skurry of clerks, hurrying
about taking up open trades.
i The announcement of the above turn of
affairs caused scarcely a ripple in the
Board "of Trade markets. Corn eased
about %e, but soon regained the loss. The
wheat market was but slightly affected,
and oats followed tne course of the corn
market. - â¢
The company was Incorporated In November, -
1900, with a capital of $30,000. The business
grew so rapidly that in the spring of this year
the capital was increased to $230,000, and with,
that Increase came still an additional Increase
in business, so that the office ' force of the
company, was simply overwhelmed. We have
been doing the largest commission business of
any. house in the world, but. it had recently
come to the attention of the firm that the
records of the transactions were not being kept
in the proper shape for such deals. About a
week ago expect accountants were put to work
on the books. I have gone over the legal end
of the firm's affairs and have found it abso
lutely correct. The expert accountants found
that it would be absolutely necessary to make
a new set of books dating from January. 1,' 1900,
and checking every Item of the Immense busi
ness. The errors were apparently made with
out. partiality, credits being debited and vice
versa. But, up to 4 o'clock yesterday, after
a week's work and . after errors had been cor
rected up to that time, the books showed the
firm . to be absolutely solvent. On my advice
they cut off all old business at midnight last
nightâ the last day of " the monthâ and trans
ferred all their open trades ta McReynolds, and
every trade of. the house is protected, and every
trade made yesterday was made at a proflt.for
the customers. We are sending out a circular
asking all our customers to send us a state
ment of their claims against the company, so
that we may have them audited and use them
in. preparing a new set of books, with the ex
pectation that, unless something happens,
which does not seem probable, we shall take
care of every claim and proceed with the busl-.
ness as heretofore. The accountants, so far.
have, found no , -evidence of criminal irregular
ity., but simply mistakes, due to the Immense
amount of business handled with inadequate
facilities for caring theYefor.
i CHICAGO, Aug. Lâ The Board of Trade
and, business circles - generally.; were
startled , to-day by, the announcement that
the 1 George H. Phillips Company, which
became famous through ifa pool opera
tions ' in the Chicago corn pit during the
past year, had transferred all its open
trades to McReynolds & Co. It was at
first rumored that a large defalcation has
been discovered in' an examination of the
booKs, Â¦ but this proved untrue, having
its Only foundation in the fact that one of
the head bookkeepers was confined to his
home by illness. Â¦ . ' : -â¢ '*Â¦ â¢
Lack of facilities" for the proper clerical
needs of the concern, which had acquired
an enormous commission trade, was, ac
cording to a statement: given out'by At
torney John S. Goodwin, who, as a repre
sentative of the law firm, of BlacK &
Goodwin, has taken charge of the com
pany's affairs, the sole reason for tem
porarily suspending business. The tangled
condition or the books became apparent
some time ago, when the Board ol Trade
directors ruled that the Phillips Company
should furnish to each member of the
May corn pool a detailed account of the
entire transaction. . A large force was
then put' to work on the books, and' In
their efforts to disentangle the multitudi
nous trades it became apparent that every
trade on the company's books since No
vember 1, 1900, would have to be checked
over, entailing an enormous amount of
work. As the firm's business kept In
creasing at a remarkable rate, the ma
chinery of the house was found inade
quate, and at midnight July 31 it was de
cided to simply transfer all trades and for
the time being throW the business of the
house into other ' hands until a complete
new; set of books shall have-been compiled.
Phillips, while regretting the necessity et
this action, said it was absolutely the only
course . open to him.
"This does not mean we are quitting
business," he said. < "On the contrary, we
shall execute all orders, but will have to
ask, that usual margins accompany, all or
ders until our books are checked over."
Following Is a statement given by At
torney Goodwin for Phillips:
Acting Governor Cooper resisted to the
last the calling of an extra session, and
the Legislature has sought to play even
by refusing to pass a bill appropriating
items inadvertently left, out of the reg
ular bills, as well as a bill to empower
the government to attempt raising money
upon old loan bills of the republic.
1 There are about a score of convicts un
der sentence of from life down to two
years liable to be discharged by the Cir
cuit Judge.
Attorney General Dole strongly resists
the action of Judge Gear. Emphatically
denied the right of . appeal and that of
having the- prisoners held in ball, he is
having recourse to a writ of mandamus
out of the Supreme Court to compel the
Circuit Judge to allow his decision to be
reviewed by the Territorial Supreme
Court. ' Judge Gear, on the other hand,
considers that .he has his back against
the rock of the United States Supreme
Court, and declares he will recognize no
superior mandate in this American Ter
ritory, unless property or contracts . are
involved.
An unverified report was received here
yesterday by a freight steamer from Ha
waji that the volcano of Kilauea was in
active eruption. - A â¢ wireless query was
sent to Hilo, but no reply came last night.
The- report is believed to be true, as for
some weeks past, the crater has been rap
idly increasing in heat and giving sur
face indications of fire. ' â¢'
The only bill pending in the extended
special session of the Legislature ia one
to provide for the payment of some old
debts of the Territory. Originally intro
duced to appropriate $74,000, it was raised
by $20,000 or $30,000 in the Senate, one new
item being for 510.000 to pay any old claims
that might be lying around loose. The
House, after sulking for some days, has
got to the length of referring the Items
to a select committee, and if its report be
favorable the whole agony will be over
to-morrow. Â»
Judge Gear reserved his first decision
until the insular decisions of the United
States Supreme Court came to hand. With
Judge Gear it is not a question of whether
the constitution follows- the flag. â¢ He
holds that the constitution arrived in Ha
waii before the flag.
In some of the cases affected the trial
courts had due notice given by the defend
ants that the Hawaiian custom of ma
jority verdicts and indictments by the
Judge would be contested.
! HONOLULU, July 26.â Judge Gear of
the First Circuit Court has rendered a se
ries of decisions in habeas corpus cases
that have started a rather extensive Jail
delivery. Thus far three prisoners have
beet sat at large vrho were serving sen
tences for burglary, felonious assault and
manslaughter. Four new petitions for
writs were filed yesterday.
In his latest judgment, Judge Gear inti
mates that he will release all prisoners
who were convicted by less than the unan
imous verdict of twelve jurors or tried
without having been regularly indicted af
ter the passage of the Newlands resolu
tion annexing the Islands to the United
States.

created to foster and promote. It was de
cided, therefore, to keep Taut of the Forty
first and give -the Central Club full swing
to fight the allied bosses.
As- the campaign progressed the Kelly-
Crimmins County committeemen, aided by
several misguided men of the defunct
Grand Hotel party, began to look for a
chance 'to breik in and win. half or a
small fraction c.t the Forty-first delegation
to the nominating convention. The bosses
flocked to the , old Dibble Club at Plxley
Hall and prepared a compromise scheme.
It was presented to the Central Republi
can Club -and rejected. Then a deter
mined effort was made to force S. C. Irv
ing and Nathan Frank on the list of dele
gates. The club, in its judgment, declined
to place these two men on the ticket.
Representatives of the Republican Pri
mary League said: -"We shall support the
ticket placed In the field by the Central
Republican Â¦ Club. We -â¢Â¦ do not ask for
league representation on the ticket, as the
members of the club : fully represent the
league anti-boss principles." Â¦ Â¦
It- seems that no personal objection was
made to S.' C. Irving and Nathan Franks,
but -they represented a faction known as
the Grand Hotelers. The Central Club
at the outset of the campaign resolved to
steer clear of all factions and therefore
Franks and Irving were objected to as
the representatives of a faction. It la
also common knowledge that this faction
.which they represent has allied itself with
Kelly and Crimmins in two districts and
stands ready to make any sort of alliance
to gain a delegate here or there. A stormy
conference of the club's executive commit
tee took place yesterday. To-night at
Lodge Hall, 1605 Polk street, there will be
a meeting of the main body of the club.
An effort will be made to break down this
ticket recommended by the committee:

Â£iven the residents of Bakersfleld, the oil
investors of Los Angeles would clamor for
a rate. At the present time. the Los An
geles oil men are paying 12-10 cents per
gallon,' which is equivalent to 50 4-10 cents
per barrel. \ â¢ -
Frank A. Garber, an oil man of Los
Angeles, was the last witness of the day.
He said the price of oil in Los Angeles
varies from 75 to 80; cents per barrel. He
said that he sold oil as cheaply as 20 cents
a barrel five years ago,, as they were pro
ducing more oil then than there was mar
ket for it. He said that In Los Anereles
and Ventura counties they were producing
20,000 to 30.000 barrels more than they had
use for. -He said 'Los Angeles was making
special prices to keep the Kern River oil
out of Its market. . - -
An adjournment was taken : until this
morning at 10 o'clock. .
Los Angeles Would Want Rate.
to the discovery of oil at Bakersfleld, he
shipped 2000 barrels a month at from 80
cents to $1.10 per barrel. He thought that
Los Angeles Investors would not sell any
more oil if the rates were reduced. He
said they do not send any more oil to this
city, as the Kern River field has control
of the market: He Â¦ said at the present
price of coal, crude oil at $1.75 per barrel
/will drive the commodity out of Los An
geles. He said oil was being sold at that
figure until Kern came down to 75 cents
a- barrel. He : was asked by Attorney
Short what interest he had in Kern River
oil property, and he surprised every one
by saying, that he was , helping to spend
$100,000 developing oil lands. He said he
had personally drilled 15 per cent of the
wells of I.ios Angeles, and has handled 50
to 60 per cent of- the oil used In that city.
He* concluded his testimony by saying
that if the Bakersfield people maintain
their ridiculously low prices, It will only
be a short time when every one will go
out of business. . . .
One of the greatest victories - ever won
for good principles and clean politics was
achieved by the Republicans of the Forty
first Assembly District last November. H.
C. Dibble, the exponent'' of bossism, was
defeated in one of the hottest campaigns
ever waged in this city. The tinti-boss
Republicans of the district must be on the
alert, however, to preserve the fruits of
the victory won last fall. The"**-allicd

PROMINENT" FIGURES IN OIL
RATE CASE - BEFORE THE
RAILROAD. COMMISSIONERS.
Edward Strasburg: of Los Angeles was
next called by. the Southern Pacific Com
pany's attorney. Mr. Strasburg said he
was interested In Kern County lands. He
said that the prtce of oil per barrel was
governed by the Bakersfleld market, and
that the constant reduction of the price
of oil has had a bad effect on the Los An
geles investors. He said Los Angeles was
producing 100,000 barrels a month, which
exceeds the consumption by 18,000 to'20,
000 barrels a month. He said the oil was
being stored and kept off the market." Mr
Strasburg admitted being in the oil busi
ness at Los Angeles for the past seven
years. He has shipped oil from that place
to this city v at 51 cents per barrel. Prior
A Los Angeles Investor.
Only a few of the firms engaged In pow
er transmission are making a profit, and
a reduction of prices of oil would affect
their ability to pay their fixed charges
and preclude further investments. .Â¦Â¦â¢- Â¦
On cross-examination witness said he
used twenty-five to thirty barrels of oil a
month. . . .
John Martin of this city proved to be a
man of innumerable enterprises. He haÂ«l
the names of the various â¢ corporations he
was interested in at his tongue's end and
he gave testimony so fast that the stenog
raphers were bewildered. He said he
was engaged in woolen milling, manu
facturing gas, power transmission, saw
milling and one or two dozen other things.
He said the high price of fuel led to tho
formation of a power company, and this
company reduced the cost of power for
manufacturing companies and the cost to
cities for the illumination of streets. "If
oil fuel would cost 10 cents a barrel the
power transmission must sell at a price
to meet it in competition. In the last six
years forty millions of dollars has been
Invested in electrical power transmission.
The further reduction of the price of
crude' oil would not only do away with
the profit in this business but would ruin
the investment. â¢
On cross-examination by Attorney
Short, witness said steam coal was feel
ing the effects in prices by reason of the
oil competition. "White Ash and Frank
lin coal from the American side of Puget
Sound sold last summer at $6 a ton, and
you can now buy all you want for ?5 50 or
less."
House coal was not affected by the oil
competition. Coal cannot compete 'with
oil at the present price. . .
Cannot Compete With. Oil.
The witness then went into a discussion
of coal and its values. Oil at 51 per bar
rel, he said, . would make big business.
He said the oil business had absorbed the
most valuable fields for coal. He thought
oil was more economical than coal. He
said that anything that would tend to de
crease the Importation . of foreign coal,
which comes to this port in wheat ships,
would increase the burden of the farmer.
It simply reduces the amount of tonnage.
He added that if the coal business was
entirely absorbed by oil it would tend to
make less plentiful the ships that come
here. He named a score of prominent
corporations who have substituted oil for
coal In their plants. Among the promi
nent firms mentioned was the Union Iron
Works, San Francisco Gas and Electric
Ccmpany, Market-street Railway system
and Western Sugar Refinery Company.
He said the coal companies were finding
it more and more difficult to get rid of
their screenings by reason of the cheap
ness of oil for fuel; He was getting ready
to enter the oil business, as his customers
were leavine him. ,
"That requires a qualifying. answer. It
would depend on the kind of coal that is
considered." ';Â¦'. -. Â¦Â¦â¢/ .
"At what price per. barrel rn^y "oil com
pete with coal in San Francisco?" he was
asked. Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦ â¢
At the afternoon session John L. How
ard, a well-known coal merchant of Oak
land, was called, to the stand by Mr. Her
rln. He testified as an expert, and his
evidence was highly interesting. He said
he had been engaged for the 'last twenty
one years In importing coal from Great
Britain, Puget Sound and other points.
cattle -would be worth SSOO, and the car
load of oil is now worth here about ?1 a
barrel. "We get double the rate per ton
per mile on cattle." Mr. Sproule said,
"than we get on oil."
On cross-examination Mr. Sproule eald
that the rate on cattle was $48 per car
He said that the oil cars had to be
shipped back empty. Mr. Short then de
sired to know whether cattle cars were
not also sent back empty and the witness
replied in the negative. He said all kinds
of freight was chipped back In stock cars.
He said fruit and perishable goods were
not chipped In this manner, but vegetables
were. Attorney Short dryly remarked
that the cars had to be well cleaned and
the witness replied that it was cheaper
to clean cars than to send them back
empty.
"The value of a carload of cattle la in
excess of the value of a carload of oil, is
It not?" asked Le Blanc's counsel.
The witness answered that a carload of
"From $63 to $65 per car."
"How much does this oil cost to carry
on a car?" asked Short.
Freights on Stock and Oil.
"When the Commissioners convened yes
terday morning Judge Short read the
complaint, in which was stated that the
producers thought a rate of 25 cents per
barrel would be a reasonable sum for the
railroad company to charge for the trans
portation of oil from the producing dis
tricts to this city. -
Mr. Kruttschnitt was sworn by Secre
tary Sesnon. He said he was familiar
with the shipment of oil from the Kern
County oil fields and said that to his
knowledge 10,000 oil cars had been sent
out. He said the principal point of their
destination was this city. On cross-exam
ination by Judge Short,- the witness said
he knew nothing about rates; that Mr
Sproule, head of the traffic department,
was responsible for making them.
William Sproule was the next witness.
According to his recollection. 180,000 bar
rels of oil were moved in this State dur
ing 1900. This was on an average of six
barrels to a ton. He said - the present
rate of 1 cent per gallon went into effect
In 1898. When the development of oil in
Bakersfield began the people of that sec
tion asked to be given the same rate en
joyed by the people of Coalinga. This was
granted, he said, to secure the new busi
ness and to offset the water competition
Attorney Short examined Mr. Sproule at
great length. He asked him the rate of
charge on cattle, fruit, merchandise and
other commodities. He even Interrogated
Mr. Sproule on washouts, rainfall and the
cost of the road, all of which the witness
endeavored to answer.
The oil men of Kern County allege that
the uniform rate of 42 cents per barrel
to Ban Francisco, plus switching charges,
which brings it up to 46 cents per barrel,
is excessive and through Mr. Le Blanc
appeal for a reduction of about 25 cents
per barrel. - -- Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦â-,
What Oil Men Want.
OIL men and railroad officials filled
the rooms of the State Board of
Railroad Commissioners yester
day to discuss oil rates and val
ues. The occasion was the hear
ing of the complaint filed with the board
by John Le Blanc of Fresno, who claims
that the oil rates charged by the railroad
company were ruinous and that a reduc
tion was necessary to foster the growing
Industry. Attorney Frank H. Short of
Fresno/ represented the complainant and
Â¦William F. Henin and J.-N. Fouids repre
sented the Southern Pacific Company.
Judge C. N. Sterry of Los Angeles and
Assistant Counsel Norton were present In
behalf of the Santa Fe system. The morn
ing session was occupied in hearing the
testimony of Julius Kruttschnitt, general
manager of the Southern Pacific Com
â¢pany, and William Sproule, freight traffic
manager of the corporation. They en
lightened the commissioners on rates and
the testimony adduced was strongly In
favor of the defense.
In the afternoon Commissioner C. S.

to seek Ms bed. Commissioners Edson
