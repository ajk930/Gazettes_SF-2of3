two no man can foretell the result. They

duck at the rustling in the wind of a stack
of papers.
A ehort time ago it was not as it Is now.
Hays issued his famous proclamation
anent politics and outside business ven
tures not mixing properly with railroad
duties. Herrin thought Hays was looking
straight at him and he shook in his boots.
But lately something has come over the
spirit of his dreams. He has resumed his
old air of hauteur, and his friends look
Â¦wise and hint of a directorate displeased
and a president not too firmly entrenched
in the favor of his employers.

yesterday states that J. B. Wright, the
deposed division superintendent, has con
fided to friends the storv of his dismissal,
and that It has become gossip among rail
road men. i
As early as March General : Manager
Julius KruttschnJtt had a talk with
Wright and ordered him to keep his hands
off politics In future. Wright replied that
he had dabbled in the came in the uast
under instruction from the Â©resident of
the company, who was his employer and
had full authority to give him instruc
tions. At this same conference ; Krutt
schnitt made the peremptory demand that
J. W. Heintzelman. master mechanic, J.
R. B. Robinson, resident engineer, and T.
J. Jones, Wright's assistant division su
perintendent, be removed. Wright de
clined to discharge these men, saying that
they were all faithful and capable em
ployes.
Genesis of "Wright's Dismissal.
"Well, if my wish is not respected,. in
that matter," Kruttschnitt Is reported, to
have said, "you had better look about for
something else to do about July L"
Wright replied . that if such demand
were insisted upon, his resignation .was
from that moment in Kruttschnitt's
hands, to be acted upon at his pleasure.
About May 1 Wright received a tele
gram frtm a high railroad official, rumor
has it, warning him of the forthcoming
ultimatum about politics and the oil busi
ness as an avocation for railroad gentle-
men. Wright replied that he was willing
to drop all outside ventures. Soon after
the. same official .wired to Wright that it
would be just as well if he would send in
his resignation. Wright telegraphed back
that his resignation had been in Krutt
schnitt's'hands since March.
It was that resignation that was accept
ed late in. May, setting adrift one of the
most popular men in the. employ of the
Southern Pacific. ; . ,.
They are trying up in Sacramento to get
Jack Wright to accept a crown, but he
has "thrice refused." . Employes of the
Southern Pacilic shops at Sacramento,
numbering 3000 men. subscribed $1000 for
a silver service, which will be presented
to their deposed chief as soon as its man
ufacture Is completed. Prominent resi
dents of Sacramento will present him an
elegant gold service.
Influential. Republicans and .Democrats
alike are urging Wright to accept the
nomination . for Mayor of Sacramento,
with the assurance that no opposing can
didate will be named. .Wright has de
clined. He says he has been a busy man
and needs rest, and that he plans to take
a trip .to Europe with | his wife. : Sacra
mentans, however, have not given up
hope, and they. believe that he will ulti
mately yield to popular clamor and con
sent to serve his city as Mayor:
Should Wright persist in his declination
W. E. Gerber, cashier of the California
State Bank, will probably be the Republi
can nominee for Mayor of the Capital
City.
"Keep your hands' off politics,!" Hays
eay? end scowls at Herrin.
"I'm not out of politics. There are a
few Ecores to be paid off, and I'll" pay
them, and Jack Wright Is the man who
will help me," says Herrin, making "goo
poo" eyes at the deposed division super
intendent up at Sacramento.
Herrin went East recently to argue a
case before the Interstate Commerce
Commission, feeling very shaky as to h!s
future. He came back with, a good bal
last of self-assurance, to the amazement
of those who thought his days of power
Â¦were gone.
Men close to Herrin say that during his
absence he obtained knowledge 6V facts
thai makes him sanguine of his own fu
ture and gleeful in anticipation of the
downfall of Hays and the withdrawal of
the anti-politics ultimatum.
Three Directors Indignant.
Herrin has confided to some that three i
members of the present board of directors
are indignant over the. summary dismissal
of Jack Wright, the popular division su
perintendent, and displeased with numer
ous features of Hays' policy. Hays has a
live-year contract, to be sure, but the men
in power now are not the men -who em
ployed him.
"And what do they care for a five-year
contract," Herrin is reported to have said,
"when the whole question of the railroad's
policy is at Issue?"
Herrin has done more. He has passed
the word along to Jack Wright that he is
In politics still and that he wants him as
his chief lieutenant, even though he is no
longer on the payroll of the Southern Pa
cific. Such palpable disloyalty would
never be ventured. It Is reasoned. If. Her
rin dlfi not feel certain of his own strength
and of Hays' weakness with the director
ate.
The attorney, however, has said that In
future he will not take so prominent a
part in politics as he has at times in the
past, and that he will play the game only
when forced into it 1n self-defense or to
settle old scores.

CARROLLTON.pa. , June 7.â The nerve
of a Georgia Sheriff, Joseph Merrill, to
day. UDheld the [ law of the State and
saved the life of a negro from a mob. In
protecting the negro, who was saved.from
the* gallows only:"- a few hours before
through the efforts oMiis lawyers, one life
was lost and two men were wounded. The
arrival 'of '<' the "Â¦: State >-' ; militia averted

o'clock a special-train the negro,
whose crime* was" the; murder of a little
white boy wham he found fishing- alone,
was speeding toward ' Atlanta,' under
guard.
-The man killed In attacking the jail was
George Bennett ' of Carrollton, ' and the
wounded men are Thomas Smith, a citi
zen of Car6llton,<and an unknown man,
presumably a farmer.' Thomas S. Word,
father: of the murdered boy, who was in
the front rank of the would-be lynchers,
was not'hit. â¢ After Bennett fell Mr. Wood
jumped upon a' window sill and exclaimed
dramatically: ' . .Â».'Â¦_
. "Shoot me, Mr. Sheriff; I would as soon
die now as any time.-' , j;
Only nine shots'were fired and the walls
of the jail show the marks of the bullets.
None of the Sheriff's posse was hit.
Williams; the' negro who caused the
trouble, was - tried and found .guilty of
murdering Otis Word, January 1, 1901, and
sentenced to be hanged to-day. He was
only this morning, refused- a : new trial,
but his attorneys filed a bill of exceptions

At the time of* his death Hugh Tevls
was not engaged in any business. He was
formerly, a member' of the firm of Co
burn, Tevis & Co., but some little while
ago sold out his Interest to the Whittlers
and did not subsequently, engage in : any
business. At the time of his marriage,
besides the elegant home he was having
Hugh Tevis was the second'' son of Mr.
and Mrs. Lloyd Tevis and brother of Dr
Harry Tevis, Will Tevis, Mrs. Frederick
Sharon and Mrs. Gordon Blanding. /Mr
Tevis was twice married. The first Mrs
Tevis was a daughter of the late Judge
Boalt. After a few years of happy mar
ried life the young wife died, leaving her
husband a daughter, Alice Tevis, who Is
now 8 years old.
Was Twice Married.
From -San Jose Mr. and Mrs. Tevis
went to Del Monte, so as to be near the
magnificent new home -Mr. Tevis was
having built and which he intended as a
home for his bride. Suddenly both Mr.
and Mrs. Tevis became possessed with
the idea that they must have a Japanese
room and garden in.their Monterey home.
With this end In view they decided upon
the Â¦ trip to the Â¦ Orient which has ter
minated so fatally for one of them.
On the 10th of April Hugh Tevls and
Miss Cornelia Baxter were married. It
was first intended that the ceremony take
place at the Tevis home on- Taylor street,
but, owing to the delicate state of Mrs.
Lloyd Tevis' health, it was feared that
the excitement might prove too much for
her and so it was finally arranged that
the wedding be celebrated at the Palace
Hotel, in the apartments of Mr. and Mrs.
George W. Baxter, the parents of the
beautiful young bride. Although there
were not more than a dozen people at
the ceremony, and those the immediate
relatives of the contracting parties, as
much attention was paid to the details
of the wedding as though all the many
friends of the happy couple were to have
been present. Dr. Harry Tevls person
ally superintended the decorations of the
apartments where the solemn words
were spoken. Thousands of gorgeous
American Beauty roses were used i in
making the room beautiful. The bride's
gown was one of the most magnificent
creations ever seen m this city. Dr. Foute
of Grace Church performed the ceremony
and after -the company had pledged the
health of the newly wedded couple bride
and groom left on a special for Â¦ San
Jose, where the first few days of the
honeymoon were spent.
Hugh Tevis' death is the tragic ending
of a romance filled with exciting incidents.
A little over two months ago he met the
lady who to-day mourns him/ - Her won
drous beauty at once captivated the mil
lionaire and three weeks after he met her
he held her promise to wed. in spite of
lhe fact that she was engaged to another
man. Tevis was madly in love with the
girl he wooed and won so quickly. The
few Ehort weeks of the enjoyment were
spent continually at her side. He kept
her rooms at the Palace- Hotel filled with
the choicest flowers. He went" calling
with her upon his most intimate friends -
friends that make up the .exclusive circle
of his mother, and to all he told of his
great and wondrous happiness.
Cause of Death Unknown.
Pending the receipt of particulars It
cannot be conjectured with anything like
certainty in what manner the final sum
mons came. It was rumored " yesterday
that deceased had a weak heart and that
the cause of death was probably heart
failure. Members of the family, however,
deny that Mr. Tevls was ever in any way
troubled with any organic disease, and
are inclined to believe that cholera was
the cause of his untimely end. Several
years ago, when Hugh Tevls made a tour
of the Orient, he was stricken with chol
era and ever since, it Is said, he showed
predisposition to contract maladies of
that nature.
Hugh Tevis was no more and- that his
widow would leave for San Francisco on
June 29. .
When the message came Mrs. Lloyd
Tevis was at Del Monte. Early yester
day morning Dr. Tevis chartered a spe
cial train and went down to meet his
mother, who decided. to return immediate
ly to her home in this city. With his
usual gentle consideration for his parent,
Dr. Tevis only showed her the first cable
gram, which told of the dangerous illness
of her son, and not until her arrival at
her home was the sad news made known.

â¢W.. WASHINGTON, June 7.â In order to
establish civil government in the Philip
pines and keep up the fiction of military
government considered necessary to pre^
vent collision with the decisions of the Su
preme Court, the suggestion has been
made that William E. Taft; chairman of
the Philippines Commission, i be given a
commission in the regular army. This
suggestion was advanced at the, meeting
of the Cabinet held to-day, when the
question of establishment of civil govern
ment was thoroughly discussed. If Judge
Taft is given a commission in the army it
would be that of a junior officer, and in
this case he would be ranked by many of
ficers, but it is stated as he is in control,
he would in his civil capacity as Governor
receive all proper recognition.
The question to which special attention
was given, by the Cabinet was:
"How far can the President go in estab
lishing civil government, taking Into con
sideration the Supreme Court decisions
and existing conditions?" â¢
In some parts of the archipelago mili
tary rule is absolutely essential for the
protection of persons friendly to Ameri
can sovereignty, while .in others peace
prevails and it would be unjust to keep
these districts under a military adminis
tration. It is the desire of the President
to give the Filipinos the largest measure
of self-government consistent with their
capabilities and the situation.
Major General MacArthur, it was again
announced to-day, would be detached
from duty as Governor General of the
Philippines on July 1 and ordered home.
As official statements heretofore made
have indicated that General MacArthur
would only be withdrawn when civil gov
ernment was established, the impression
prevailed at the War Department that
civil government under Secretary Root
would be formally established on that
date.

JUDG E TAFT MAY
ENTER THE ARMY
WASHINGTON, June 7.â Major G. W.
Ruthers, chief commissary ef the-Depart
ment of Northern "Luzon, ! in' a letter 'to
Commissary General WestOn, dated' April
15, says there are 33S' stations in that-de
partment with about 25,000 troops, and
that the supplying of an army of this size
divided into many stations is much- more
difficult than if it was an army , in one
body. Besides the troops, there were at,
that time several thousand prisoners who'
were being fed by the Government. The
subsistence department,' Â¦ he says, -is in
superb condition and many gratifying re
ports are received from all the officers.
General Wheaton has taken occasion sev
eral times to speak in the highest terms
of the commissary department.. '
Major Ruthers devotes considerable
space in his letter to the subject of beef
supply. For the most part the meat ra
tion served the troops is the refrigerated
or frozen beef, although at some of the
interior points where there is neither rail
or water transportation this supply is
necessarily curtailed. He had sent beef
sixty miles into the interior with bull
carts. He noted as a remarkable fact
that this beef was transported through a
country infested with ladrones and small
bands of insurgents, yet the cart drivers
and supplies were not molested. He says
they must have paid toll: to. the' tribal
chiefs, for had the supplies been accom
panied by escorts there would have been
a daily ambush. He says there is need
of, more water transportation, and if he
had it he would use more frozen beef, as
the influence on the sick report Is quite
marked: the more fresh meat used the
better the health of the troops. The na
tive beef, from which the animal" heat is
not entirely departed, is not healthy.
Major Ruthers says the beef stew with
vegetables is the finest component of the
ration ever put into the hands. of troops
and is highly praised by them. He also
says that the standard emergency ration
has given very grood satisfaction. At the
same time, he adds:
"A ration of stew and vegetables, one
pound of hard bread in tin and a tablet of
chocolate. I would put against any so
called emergency ever manufactured, and
it would not cause intestinal irritation, of
which some complaint 's made."
In this connection he mentions the de
mand for sauerkraut. Without abundance
of nutritious food, he said,, the health of
Americans cannot be maintained in the
Luzon climate. The health of Filipinos
living on American food, he says, is much
better than those living on native foods.

Communication Which. Cubans Pub
lished in Violation of a Confidence.
WASHINGTON, . June 7.-During ;the
conference between Secretary Root and
the Cuban y Commission the Secretary
wrote a letter to Senator Platt of Connec
ticut, ' Who introduced . the Platt amend
ment, asking, for his views relative to in
tervention as mentioned In the third
clause of the amendment. Senator Tlatt
replied, and his. letter was furnished to
the commission confidentially by the Sec
retary of War and was incorporated into
and made a part of the acceptance of the
Platt amendment by the constitutional
convention. The letter, however, appeared
in a Havana paper and to-day, was made
public by the War Department. Follow
ing is the>text of the -letter: â¢ .-Â¦
' I am. In receipt of your letter of â¢ this date,

In reply, I beg to state that the amendment
was carefully prepared with the I object of
avoiding any possible idea that by the ac
ceptance thereof the constitutional - convention
would thereby establish a protectorate or
suzerainty, or In any manner whatsoever com
promise the independence or sovereignty of
Cuba; and, speaking for myself, it seems Im
possible that such an -Interpretation can be
given to the clause. I believe that the amend
ment should be . considered as a whole, and it
ought to be clear on reading that its well
denned purpose is to secure and safeguard
Cuban independence and " set forth at once a
clear idea of the friendly disposition of the
United States toward the. Cuban people and
the express intention on their part to aid them
If necessary, . in the maintenance of said In
dependence. These are my ideas, and , al
though, as- you say, I cannot speak for the

TV., WASHINGTON, June. 7.â Cuba! and
its constitutional convention occupied the
attention of the Cabinet to-day for nearly
two hours. General Wood has been in
structed officially to say to the Cubans
that they cannot proceed to form tbeir
government -until the Platt amendment
has been accepted in letter and spirit.
S The latest telegram from General Wood
had convinced Secretary Root .that the
chances : for acceptance of ! the Platt
amendment without a string ~ tied to it
were not good at this time. A false con
struction'has been put not only on the
conversation of the President and Secre
tary Root with the Cuban delegation, but
on a confidential letter -written by Senator
O. H. Platt. author of the Cuban relations
amendment to the, army bill. This letter,
to the astonishment of the Administra
tion, has been . published in Spanish in
Havana, and made to appear as a justi
fication for the Cuban "version" attached
to the Platt amendment when adopted by
the convention. The outcome of the Cab
inet meeting is thus stated by one of
those present: ..'. <
"We feel that it will be some time be
fore the Cubans accept the Platt amend
ment. The determination is that .the
amendment shall be accepted before the
Cubans are allowed -to establish their own
government. It is very, much our affair,
and yet the Cubans are Â¦ the ones who are
the losers. They are. losing just so much
time in getting their government going-
We. on the other hand, .will continue mil
itary occupation ! and â¢ control as . at pres
ent.- There are no indications of a change
of policy here, and I am glad to say. that
there are no signs of trouble in Cuba. . In
time the Platt amendment will be adopt
ed, but perhaps not very soon."/
After the Cabinet meeting General
Wood was again informed by Secretary
Root that there were no new instruc
tions, and that the administration would
insist upon the adoption * of the Platt
amendment as prerequisite to the forma
tion of a government, without any
."understandings". teeing attached thereto.

partner were not to be taken seriously.
George Watson, the dead nnan's eldest
ton, has acted as peacemaker In the quar

Wlsenberger is held in the Lassen County

that it occurred Curing a duel between
the two men, Watson having a rifle and
Wisenberger a shotgun. Wisenberger
claims he did not fire until "Watson had
twice shot at him. The . victim of the
tragedy was 72 years* of age and. in feeble
health. He was one of the richest men in
Lassen County, owning much land and
great herds of cattle.
Wisenberger. Watson and Henry Vogt
were partners in a mining claim situated
on Watson's land. They had a written
contract by which water was to be used
fcfr the mine before Watson could use it
for irrigation, only the waste water being
utilized for the latter purpose. â¢ Watson of
late objected to the terms of this agree
ment and the partners quarreled fre
quently. On Sunday Watson ordered
Wisenberger out of the cabin on his land.
Watson, carrying a spade and a rifle
and accompanied by his son Frank. 17
years of age, went yesterday to the ditch
that conveys the water. Seeing that he
intende<l to cut off the water from the
mine and turn it upon his land, W?sen

sist. Wisenberger claims Watson fired at
him twice, but missed. Then Wisenber
erer shot and killed Watson. When Frank
Watson saw his father fall he became
frantic and fired at Wisenberger three
times without effect.

"Mrs. McKinley is now resting com
fortably. Her condition. shows no change
as compared with the situation announced
in this morning's bulletin. She pas not
lost any ground, nor, on the other hand,
has there been any perceptible improve
ment. She is just the same as when we
saw her this mcgnlng."
Dr. Rixey, when asked regarding the
result of the microscopic examination of*
the patient's blood, said he had nothing
to say on the subject, and that " if any
thing was given out It would.be after a
consultation of the three physicians. He
said there had been no unfavorable devel
opments during the day. Some apprehen
sion has been felt as to the possible un
favorable effect of the warm weather, but
a heavy rain fell to-day- and' brought
lower temperature, and much satisfaction
was expressed at the White House at the
temporary- relief.. Mrs. â¢ McKinley â¢ or
dinarily suffers little from the heat of the
summer at Washington, but the possible
effect of it at this time, in /view of her low
vitality and the necessity for guarding
against anything in the nature of a sink
ing spell or a drain upon her strength,
caused some anxiety.
The complaint from which Mrs. McKln
lej suffered" in San Francisco is not en
tirely checked, but it is said to be under
better control. Despite some reports" to
the contrary, It is stated emphatically at
the White House that Mrs. McKinley has
not grown any worse. The President saw
no callers this evening. At 4 o'clock this
afternoon : he went out unaccompanied on.
the customary drive, but returned sud
denly after being out less than twenty
minutes. .â¢â¢..:. .
Dr. Rixey at 10:30 o'clock to-night made
this statement as he left the "White
House:
The examination of Mrs. McKinley's
blooil, which has been made under the di
rection of the attending physicians,
showed no negative results, tthere- being
no evidence of blood poison. This is only
one of various examinations that are be
ing made by the physicians to determine
the character of the, illness of Mrs. Mc-
Kinley. The blood was taken from her
arm last Tuesday. -
"Mrs: McKinley's physicians state that
her condition" is about the same as/e
ported yesterday. There has been no ma
terial change in the past twenty-four
hours."

but as his clothing was "not found on the
bank of the pond and a rumor was cur
rent that a boy had been seen running

cepted theory was that he had witnessed

tragic event had so frightened him that
he had run away and was in hiding-.*

is very shallow except in one small spot,
where there is a hole six feet deep. In
this hole the body was located and when
it was brought to the surface it was dis
covered that it was fully clothed.
On the pond was floating an improvised
raft, evidently made by the two boys It
was constructed by nailing some fence
boards to two posts. The theory is that
the youngest. boy was riding on the raft
that he fell from it and when his brother
went to his rescue grasped the latter- in a
manner that prevented him from swim

drowned. . â¢
STOCKTON, June 7.â Frank D. and An

for a span of mules and a camping outfit.
Until to-day Mr. and Mrs. Crafts lived
on what is known as the . Terminal tract,
in the western part of the city, with their
four children, the youngest of which was
little Marguerite, born to .them, last,No

few days ago Mr. and Mrs. Dickinson
came from Nevada to Stockton with a
camping outfit and sought permission to
camp near Crafts' home. The Dickinsons
had no children.- Marguerite toddled over
to visit the campers and Mrs. Dickinson
straightway fell in love - with the little
one. She playfully told the Crafts how
much she wanted little Marguerite, and
was surprised when they expressed a
willingness to let her have the child.
Crafts finally offered to : give Mr. and
Mrs. Dickinson the child, together with
his house and lot, for the camping outfit.
Mr and Mrs.* Dickinson accepted the of
fer. Crafts explained the apparently in
human, deal by saying that he and his
wife were too poor to properly raise all
four children, and that they had rather
part with their youngest than see it grow
up In poverty. : v - . Â¦

about those who did it there is not a
word.

Jury met and commenced Its investiga

nesses that have been summoned and it _

SEEMINGLY HOPELESS INVESTIGATION
EAKERSFIELD, June 7.â The vigi
lantes who made the | midnight attack
upon the camp of the Superior Sunset
# Oll Company in Midway a few weeks ago
are to be prosecuted to the full extent of
the law. One arrest has been made and
a blanket warrant- Is now out for the ar
rest of many prominent men who are
supposed to have been implicated in the
assault in. which George Walker was seri
ously wounded and George P. Cornell
made a cripple for life. â¢Â»
Claude Donley, a brotlier of Milton J.
Donley, who Is one of the heaviest own
ers in the Mount Diablo Company, which
is supposed to have incited the assault,
was the first man arrested. He was tak
en into custody by Deputy United States
Marshal Radke at Midway, where he is
employed as assistant superintendent of
the Midway Oil Company, which pur
chased the land from the Superior Sunset
Company after the shooting. He was ar
raigned here before Judge Mlllard this
afternoon and gave bail in the sum of
13000.
Other persons named in the warrant of
arrat include those prominent in busi
ness and professional circles. Among
them are J. A. Chanslor, the millionaire
oil magnate; Dr. A. F. Shaffer, County
Physician for the county of Kern; J. W.
Jameson, the well-known attorney ,and
oil man; H. P. Andersen of tthe whole
sale liquor house of Andersen & Ross; E.
J. Boust, ex-Deputy United States Mar
shal; William Hendrick, F. T. Hall. W.
C. Furtig and others Â¦whose names cannot
be learned. John Does and Richard Roes
cover those whose connection with the as
sault has not yet been, established.
The warrant is sworn to by J. W. Cros
land, ex-County Recorder and president
of the Superior Sunset Oil Company, who
was present on the disputed land on the
night of the battle. A Pinkerton man,
Tiechnor by name, has been working in
Bakersfield, Sunset and Midway since the
shooting.' He has, lit is said, considerable
damaging evidence against the accused
men. He came here at the instigation of
Cornell's father, who is a prominent min

EataiMRun.
There isn't a man who would be seen
running through the street munching a
piece of pie. - Why not? Because it
would mean dyspepsia and* stomach
trouble? Not at all;. but because it
wouldn't look well. As a matter i of fact
many a business man snatches a lunch
in such a hurry that he might as well
take it on the run. That is one reason*
for the prevailing "stomach trouble"
among men of business.
There is a" certain remedy for diseases
of the stomach | and other organs of
digestion and nutrition. It is - Doctor
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. The
worst cases of dyspepsia and catarrh of
the stomach have been cured by this
medicine. It cures where all other
means have, failed to cure."'

Medical Discovery for stomach trouble," Â¦writes -

The tennis cracks are practicing con
stantly for the State championship sin
gle?, which will be held on July 4. This
is the first tournament of the kind ever
held here and gives _ promise of a great
success. It has notfeen definitely settled
whether this tournament will be played
on the 4th of July each year or not. The
tournament itself is a fixture, but its date
for the future has not yet been settled. Â¦
The coast championship singles next
year will probably be played, in July,
while the State tournament will come off
in September with the doubles. This
change of dates is due to the fact that a
number of cracks from the north and
south have promised to participate if the
singles and doubles are played simultane
ously.
. Considerable discussion has been going
on ol late as to who should rank directly
after the Whitneys In the Calif ornia' Ten
nis Club. To settle this question a tour
nament will be held in the near future on
tht: local courts. The idea is to pick the
eight best men in the club. and let them
play aground robin tournament. In this
way each player would have a- match
with every man entered and the one win
ning the most matches would rank third.
The men who will probably be picked are
M. B. Collier, Merle Johnson, Norman
Hodgkinson. Drummond McGavin, Harold
Crowell. Ray Cornell. Chester Smith and
Grant Smith. Al Rosenberg would easily
get a place among the eight, but he ls out
of the game for good and will not be able
to play. This event will probably.be start
ed a week from Sunday, but as it is to be
a round robin affair it will take several
days to finish It. ;,
R. N. Whitney surprised 'everybody by
the game he put up against his brother
George in the finals of the tournament
last Saturday. When he is at his best
his game is but little behind that of the

of a torrid contest Moffatt broke his arm.
Both men are looked upon as the leaders

While a good deal of play takes place
on Saturdays, Sundays arid holidays' on
the Presidio links, no tournaments or
events of -general interest are, being
played, there. On Decoration day -there
was a handicap* over eighteen * holes,
match play, against, bogey, '.which : was
won by H. C. Golcher, Charles Page and
B. D. Adamson tying for second prize.
The tie was to have been played off last
Sunday, -but Charles Page was absent. It
may be decided this afternoon.
.-President J. W. Byrne of the San Fran
cisco Golf Club is in good form just now.
Last Saturday he beat L. O. Kellogg two
up on three rounds, and on Sunday ' he
defeated H. C. Golcher six up over
eighteen holes and L. O.' Kellogg one up
on nine holes. On Saturday J. W. Byrne
and . Li. O. Kellogg with their best ball
beat B. D. Adumson. Robert Johnstone,
the club professional, has been, over at
the San Rafael links playing with Alex
ander Bell. . .
On Decoration day the . qualifying
rounds' for the competition for the
Council's cup and Ladies' cup of the San
Rafael Golf Club were held, and on Sat
urday, June 1, the opening rounds at
match play took place. The final round
should be between E. J. ; McCutcheh, who
has already won .the trophy twice, and
R. G. Brown. If the cup is won thrice
by the same. player it becomes his prop
erty.
. In the first round at match play of the
contest for the Ladies' cup at San Rafael
Mrs. F. S. Jonr.son beat Miss Eleanor
Morrow eight up seven to play ;â¢ Mrs. J. J.
Crooks defeated Mrs. S. G. Buckbee and
Mrs. R. Gilman Brown drew a bye. In
the second, round Mrs. F. S. Johnson met
Mrs. 3: J. Crooks and Mrs. R. G. Brown
again drew, a bye. The winner of the
Crcoks-Johnson match will meet Mrs. R.
G. Brown in the final round, and the cup
will probably become the property of
Mrs. Brown, who has already won it
twice. . Â¦ . â¢ Â¦ . ' Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦ .
* To-day on the links of the Sausallto

AN- accident occurred in the fifth
tsce at Oakland yesterday which
ended In the spilling of three
jeekcys and made a general pile
of hoises and boys on the far
turn of the track. It was in the five and
a half furious race and was due to the
reckless rough riding of the jockeys.
Guiterrez on Louwelsea, Bassinger on
Royalty and Fcuntleroy on Lento fell in
a heap, Guiterrez sustaining the greatest
injuries, but which were not pronounced !
serious by the attending physlcianr Bas
singer was the least damaged of the three
jockeys.
"With Louwelsea, the favorite, out, Jar
retierre d'Or walked in, Torso Maid get
ting the place and Vasallo the show.
Royalty and Lento went down together
and Louwelsea, a few lengths back,
could not escape the wreck and joined
the pile.
There were op even dozen in the first
i ace and more than half of them were
played. Sea Spray being a 3 to 1 favorite.
Homestake went over the six furlongs
fast enough to beat out the rest, coming
up from behind, and by a strong finish
under Bassinger s bat passed Lillie Diggs
and Pidalia Just before the wire was
reached.
A bunch of thirteen maiden two-year
olds got away in the second race in a good
start, Post Bell at 15 to 1 leading all the
way and capturing the first money.
Cousin Sue made the place and Robert
Bonner the show.
Odd Eyes, with Guiterrez In the saddle,
smiled sweetly and cantered around the
six-furlong course, leaving all others in
the rear. When the paddock was reached
Frank Woods bounded out. of the pack,
passing Sweet Voice and Carlonian, who
held the second position, and came under
the wire for the place. Frank Woods
also spurted and took the show money.
Guiterrez's third win was on Matilda
O in the mile event, the fourth on the
card. Soon after the start Matilda O.went
out and won by four lengths, Lucera, rid
den by Bergen, getting the place from
Cerro Santa. Matilda O was backed from
5 to 7 to 2.
Rinaldo started out to end quickly the
last race, over the mile course, but died
at the stretch. Alicia, the favorite, fin
ished strongly but could not overtake
Merops, who passed to the front when
Rinaldo stopped short. Lost Girl got the
show.

SPILLED ON THE OAKLAND TRACK
' EOTHESAY, Firth of Clyde, June 7.â
The Glasgow expedition regatta opened
to-day. â¢ The yachts started, in a brisk
northwest breeze over a course in the
form of a" square, lying between the Isl
and^ of.Bule and Mirchshire, giving a fair
trial on all points of sailing. Twice round
the course and a "distance" and I back
made a total of fifty miles sailed. ; _
The race, was divided into two parts,
both having special '. points of Interest for
Americans. In the first division Sham
rock I was pitted against the best single
stickers in â¢ British . waters. She was
heavily, handicapped ;'*' under the British
racing rules, giving the Meteor forty-five
minutes thirty-nine seconds; the Sybar
ita, Â¦ forty-two minutes thirty-four sec
onds, and the Kariad forty-seven minutes
four seconds. Â¦ ' .
Interest in the second race centered in
Charles F. Herreshofl Jr.'s new cutter
Nevada. She was designed with little' re
gard for the restrictions of the British
racing rules, and it was said that, If suc
cessful, she would either set the fashion
for British designing or force the Racing
Association to materially modify ... the
measurement rules. Her competitors, the
Lais, Carina and Tutty, were fairly rep
resentative . of the .work . of . British build
ers two seasonsago. ' - v ; ' "â¢
.The representatives , of -the four big
yards were sent off with full light weath
er canvas to a capital start. The Kariad;
Meteor and Sybarita were beam and beam
with the Shamrock I half a length astern.
They had an- easy flve-mile reach to the
first mark. When the former cup chal
lenger turned the first mark she led the
Meteor and the Kariad . by , half a min
ute and the Sybarita by one minute twen
ty-fcur seconds. When the next leg was
fixed the Shamrock I led the Sybarita by
one minute forty-four seconds, the Meteor
by four minutes and the Kariad by over
ten minutes. . The wind then softened and
the i>ace slackened.
In the other class the Nevada was well
placed at the start, and rah ahead and
passed the second mark one minute "and
thirty seconds ahead of the Carina, two
minutes ahead of the Tutty. and nearly
three minutes ahead of the Lais.
; On the last leg of the. first round Sham
rock I showed well and" she* passed the
mark nine minutes and, fifty, seconds be
fore the Sybarita, which, was two minutes
and thirty-eight seconds ! ahead of the
Meteor. On the second leg of the second
round the Shamrock was hopelessly be
calmed off Cumbrae Island, and all three
of her rivals passed her there.
After having sailed half of the first
round In good style the Nevada was pass
ed by the Tutty and the Carina, and was
third to finish- the round, nine minutes and
nine seconds after the Tutty.
The Sybarita's time at the . finish was
7 hours 14 minutes 34 seconds. She won
both ' prizes â time and first . to finish-
Others were far astern. The Meteor's
time at the finish was 7:42:56: the 1 Ka
riad's 7:47:02, and the Shamrock's 7:47:3G.
Although the wind freshened a trifle, the
former cup challenger -was hopelessly be
hind. The Nevada won- the race for 65
footers. covering the course in 9:25:17.
None of her competitors has yet been
sighted.

should have been canned," "a crustacean"
and "a man whose lamps were out and
who could not tell a strike on a fair
house." Tyler bore the badinage without
a murmur, but time and again he threat
ened to fine a player for doubting his de
cisions.
The umpire was not entitled to all the
unpleasant things said of him. It is true
his decisions at times were faulty. He
was erratic, and did not know whether he
was refereeing- a game of marbles or the
national game. His plight was due to the
players' constant kicking. He tried to
satisfy both sides and the spectators in
cluded, but made a failure. When he gets
over his apparent nervousness he may be
aceerleble. but at present his work is un
satisfactory.
The Dutch played ball with as much In
terest as a man has in a game of cro
quet. Eight errors attest the kind of ball
they played yesterday. It was an off day
with the men from over the Rhine, and
every one but themselves knew it.
Oakland put up a surprisingly good ar
ticle. Even old man Decker forgot his
"eharley-horse" and got into the game.
Pete Lohman had his batting eye with
him and slammed the- ball in every corner
of the lot. Dr. Moskiman occupied the
slab for Oakland and he filled the position
to the satisfaction of every one but
the Dutch. He held the latter down
to six swats. Iburg was afflicted with a
feeling of lassitude and never tried to ex
ert himself. He allowed four men to
walk in the second and was touched up
for ten slams. The following score ex
plains the defeat of the locals:

A small boy with a shrill voice enliv
ened the game between the Dudes and
Dutch yesterday by making apt criticisms
of Umpire Tyler. But for his presence
the game "would have lost Its flavor and
the spectators their interest. The youth
took his cue from the players, and during
the nine rounds of indifferent baseball
pelted the holder of the indicator with a
choice selection of adjectives. In the lad's

One incident of the presence of smallpox there has
been the mistake of confusing the Blind Asylum at
Berkeley with the Adult Blind Home, several miles
away, in Oakland. In the latter there has been no
smallpox or other contagious disease, but the people
have been almost afraid to pass it in the street cars.
As the Adult Blind Home is a manufacturing institu
tion its commerce has suffered somewhat from this
error of confusing it with the Blind Asylum. As the
actual sufferers and the adult blind victims of the mis
take are all deserving objects of the humane purposes
of the people, the press and health authorities should
take some pains to correct the erroneous impression.
The remote cause of these smallpox epidemics should
put every, one on guard against handling army tents
and other articles from the Philippines, and the quar
termaster should especially guard against the sale of
old tents. This is the camping season in California,
and the romance that hangs about an army tent that
has seen service. prompts many to buy one, only to
find that romance and the smallpox share it between
them. --Â¦;"
In other cases the disease was transmitted- bv
souvenirs and articles for personal use sent home by
tofdiers and others from Manila. The most consider
able outbreak of the disease in this State was in the
Deaf, Dumt) and Blind Asylum at Berkeley. Among
the students and others there have been seventy-nine
cases of smallpox and varioloid, and there are now
under detention sixty-two cases. The State Board of
Health has just inspected the situation there, and finds
such skillful creditable management by the .of
ficers of the institution and the local health officers
that no death has occurred and none of the remain
ing cases will result fatally. The institution has no.
hospital facilities, and the care, labor and caution re
quired to manage such an epidemic are almost beyond
computation. That the management has been so
skillful and the results so satisfactory is the highest
praise the officers could have. Where so many defec
tive children are massed together there should be
ample hospital accommodations. An invasion of the
juvenile contagious diseases, measles, scarlet fever and
mumps, is always to be apprehended, and an epidemic
can be prevented only by isolation in a hospital.
r> MALLPOX is prevalent all over the United
States. Every large city has, or has recently had,
many cases of the disease. It is due to our in
creased intercourse with our tropical islands. In the
tropics this terror of the temperate zone is not feared
as much as we fear the measles. It is a common thing
hi the Philippines to see women covered with small
pox pustules selling fruit on street stands, and men
and children with the disease going about as if no"thing
were the matter. It is practically impossible to mingle
with the population in the tropics without getting
smallpox germs in one's clothing. Several out
breaks in this country have been traced to the use of
old army tents from the Philippines, sold to people
who desire them for camping or for use as playhouses
by children.

One of the reorganizes in a recent letter to /'the
Nebraska Independent said: "The proper thing to
do is to form a new party, right here in Nebraska for
the State- only, and call it the American party. .' The
platform should" contain money, transportation and a
plank against trusts, against imperialism, favor the
ownership of the telephone and telegraph,' .and with-^
out any fusion. When Abraham Lincohvwas elected
President the Democrats were" in two, and had they
not been the Republicans would have been snowed
under^forty feet deep. Lincoln was a : minority Presi

there will be two parties .in the field that favor the.
'gold standard' and all that it contains. This /will place"

{ the Republicans, and the remainder. for the reformers.
This would be the easiest way to win, ; and j the' best
way. But to talk that the Democrats or Populistsxaii

THE WORLD'S RAILWAYS.
FROM the convention of Railway Commissioners
in this city there 'will 4 result not only; pleas
ure for all the delegates and their friends
but also much that will "tend .to'..! a; .sblutionifof
some at least of the many problems involved in; rail
road management. and in the relations of Ahe roads' to
the public. The world is full of talk about airships
and of electric lines, but" it is certain 'our transporta
tion facilities on land for many a- year yet are going
to be mainly dependent on steam; railways, and con
sequently the proper supervision; of^^such roads is a
matter' of ; highest importance to all.
The Prussian Ministry 'of. Public Works, which
keeps a record of the steam railway mileage of the
world and its increase from year to year, has recently
issued a summary on the subject, with the figures
brought down to 1899. The mileage and the per
centage of increase by continents for four years ex
pressed in American measurements is thus given:
â¢ , Per cent
Miles of increase
road Since 1895.
Europe. 172,621 â¢ 10.5 .

"The world".:....::. .....r.^.:..;V.:.;.479,90d iiJ.2 ]'*-.
The entire increase of railroad in the 'world for
1898 was 13,166 miles,- or about what had been con
structed in the United States alone in 1887. It will
be noted in the table that in the per^ cent of increase
since 1895 Africa has led the other continents. The
rate of increase there is, moreover, likely to be large
for some time to come, as the development of "the
possessions of the different European powers in that
continent will necessarily entail, a considerable rail
way extension in the near future, even if Cecil Rhodes
should fail to carry out his great enterprise' of build
ing a road -from the Cape to Cairo.
In the United States the absolute mileage is so
large the per cent of increase is of course small. We
are still far short of the railway, facilities which are
needed in" our vast territory, but it is not likely we
shall ever see again any such extensive railway build
ing as marked, our development in the past:
As Africa led the continents in the per cent of in
crease in railway mileage during the last four years,
so Siberia led the countries of the world with an in
crease of 244 per cent to 223 per cent An China, 35
per cent in Turkey, 25 per cent in Denmark, 22 per
cent in Russia, 17 per cent in Austria-Hungary, 13 per
cent in Roumania, it per cent in Norway," 10 per
cent in Sweden, and 8.8. per cent in Germany, against
only 4 per cent in the United States. Great Britain's
increase was only 2.4 per cent. Â¦; '
'At the present time our railway magnates are more
attentive' to the task of combining and co-ordinating
existing roads than to that of Â¦constructing'' new ones.
Our capital and our "energies are being directed now
to other things, and we can weir afford to so ; em
ploy them. In fact, our main railway problem now is
how to make best use of the existing roads, and in
that work* the distinguished visitors to the conven
tion in this city can be counted on to ' accomplish
much.

STATUS OF THE FILIPINOS.
THE San Francisco Chronicle .advocated free
trade with the Philippinesion the ground that the
constitution followed the flag and Congress was
estopped from restricting trade. The Republican Na
tronal Convention antagonized that position, and has
been affirmed by the 'Supreme Court. Under the
court's decision Congress may commit the entire gov
ernment of the islands to the President, or it may
enact restrictive laws. It will be seen that the. policy
of this country toward the islands. is to be governed
by expediency only, as the court says expressly that
the constitution omitted to provide any authority in
the premises^ and_vve are to act simply as a sover
eignty, just as' other nations have acted under similar
circumstances, no matter what the form and limita
tions of their home government.
Discussing, then,- the question of what it is expe
dient to do in the Philippines, it is found that there
are certain physical limitations that no human power
can pass. ' The climate is tropical, and white labor
cannot exist there.. The natives are irfdustrious "only
up to the point of self-support, but are without com
mercial ambition and will not toil to produce a sur
plus for export. The only productive labor there im
portant to commerce is Chinese coolie labor. No
census has been taken that shows how many coolies
are domesticated. there, but they are doing all the pro
ductive work in: the field and forest. The large ex
ports of hemp and other Philippine products of which
our people read- with pleasure are the result of this
coolie labor.
Is it expedient to give the product of such labor
free entry into the American market? We think not.
To do so is to exploit American labor for the benefit
of those who speculate in the richness and low wages
of the islands. Is it expedient to deport the Chinese
from the Philippines? That is to be answered by those
who are interested in the Chinese trade. The coolies
are there under a right acquired from- Spain. We
have inherited the shoes and the -troubles of Spain,
and it is for those who were responsible for it to say
how far we can go in dealing with China in the mat
ter without repelling her commercial friendship and
injuring our trade. As far as The Call is concerned
it is opposed to Chinese labor in the Philippines com
peting with American labor, as it will under free
trade. ; ; â¢ . â¢ ' '
We gave ample warning of the situation in Hawaii,
but were not heeded at the time. Hawaii is now a
Territory, and white labor is not domesticated there
and never can be. If the servile labor from Asia and
Porto Rico were deported from Hawaii to-morrow
the commercial prosperity of that Territory would
cease. ...
It is well to look facts in the face, and indulge in no
misrepresentation. The San Francisco Chronicle, de
feated by the Republican National Convention and the
Supreme Court, now declares free trade with the Phil
ippines to be immediately expedient. It declares that
"the only possible source of profit from our political
relations to the islands is in unrestricted intercourse
between them and the mainland."
We deny that there will be any profit out of the
islands unless coolie labor produces.it, and that profit
will go to the exploiter, and will finally come out of
competing American labor.
The Chronicle says: "That American enterprise
will develop the islands is to be hoped,~bui the result
ing labor belongs to the native inhabitants under fis
cal conditions which will" prevent that labor from un
derbidding the labor of the mainland."
How is that procession of words to be interpreted?
What "fiscal conditions" can prevent labor under
bidding?.
In discussing such a serious issue of- expediency
exact terms should be used. Labor in Hawaii now un
derbids that of the mainland,' and our commercial
union with that Territory is exactly what the Chron
icle demands for the Philippines.
It is well also to be truthful in such a discussion.
The Chronicle, referring to The Call, says that we
"desire to prevent exploitation of the country by
Americans, but to' use our army to hold the poor
natives in subjection while they are exploited by the
Chinese."
There is no justification of such a statement. We
desire no such thing. The uncontroverted testimony
of the leading Filipinos is that they want admission
into the Union as self-governing States, and liberty to
do as they please within the limitations of States.
This the American jieople will never permit. The
islands are of no commercial importance without
coolie labor. ' Cboiie labor and free trade are inimical
to American interests. There is the problem. We
make no pretense of solving it. We simply stand by
American interests in opposing statehood and citizen
ship and free trade.
ginsiby proposing the organization of a party with"' a
new j name - for Nebraska : only, > but ; straightway pro
ceeds to outline a nationalplatforfn for it and to point
out how it can elect a President without the support
of a majority of the people. It would seem that such
a view exaggerates the importance of Nebraska; for; it
is hardly credible 'to outsiders 'that' a Nebraska State
party even if called "the American party" can carry
the Union. ' - -
The Kansas men- are a little more rational. They, do
not dream of carrying the Union by the organization
of a new party for their State only. They suggest the
reorganization of Democracy; and Populism as the
Union party. By the adoption of 'a hew name they
argue their organization will get rid of the perplexi
ties of fusion and at the same time get rid also of all
those Democratic traditions to which Populists ob
ject. They point out that .when voting as separate
parties the Populists polled in Kansas 107,000 votes to
115,000 Republican and 71,000 Democratic, and they
insist that if the Union party be formed- Kansas will
be safe for the new organization; nor do they -hesitate
to predict that if the movement be followed elsewhere
as Kansas goes so will go the Union. . " V "X
All these plans for reorganization are interesting
evidences of the confusion that exists among the ranks
of the opposition to Republicanism. Bourbonism and
radicalism are struggling for supremacy in the camp
of a disintegrating organization, and the results are
liicely to have an important effect 1 upon; our politics;

this world-renowned benefaction.- have
had a happy and unifying Influence? upon
the sections that cannot be overestimated.
The fund was reduced to $1,000,000 by the
refusal of Mississippi and Florida to
pay their, bonds. The Income from the
remainder is used in the work which has
been described. Since 1S67 nearly $3,000,000
has been paid out by the treasurers, main
ly on recommendation of the general
agents. When it is said that that most
eminent and experienced , financier. J.
Pierpont Morgan, is the treasurer, 'one
may know that the finances are managed
without diminution for - salary , and with
consummate and unparalleled skill.
by men of equal distinction and ability.
These trustees fortunately selected ' as
general asent Dr. Barnas Sears, a ripe
scholar, an expert In education, of un
failing tact, courtesy and common sense.
With a full mind and the personal sug
gestions of Mr. Peabodyâ for he lived
nearly three years after the gift and at
tended two of the meetingsâ rDr. Sears per
formed with consummate discretion and
ability his delicate duties, and under his
supervision the trust was inaugurated
and began its career of wide usefulness.
Establishing " Common Schools:,
The first step under Dr. Sears, growing
put of his study of the situation, was to
lay foundations for the establishment of
public school systems. It needs to be
borne in mind that under the ancient reg
ime no public school system providing
universal education existed at the South,
was no system adequate to the ed
ucation at public expense, of the white
youth and the peculiar social system for
badf. the education of the negroes. Sparse
population made permanent systems diffi
cult, if not impossible. Slavery was now
fortunately abolished and by the four
teenth amendment national citizenship
was created and co-occupancy of the
same territory by two distinct races, with
the same civil rights and- privileges, made
the education of the negroes. a social, po
litical and industrial necessity. The South
had had academies and colleges of high
order, equal to any in the land, turning
out products in manhood and womanhood
rot inferior to those in any civilized coun
try, but there was no system on the stat
ute book adapted to the needs of the en
tire population. Free schools for- all the
people was the only sufficient scheme to
carry out Mr. Peabody's clearly expressed
intentions and to put the 'South on 'a
plane of equality, in capability and men
tal attainments, with States which had
had for years well - devised common
schools. Obviously, the first indispensa
ble step was to create a healthy and sus
taining Â¦ public opinion and to organize
that opinion for * legislative and commun
ity action. Dr. Sears chose his residence
at'Staunton, Va., visited every Southern
State, spoke in cities and towns, addrsec
ed Legislatures, utilized the public press,
stimulated the establishment of schools
by giving to them liberal aid from the
Peabody fund, always on the simple and
wise principle of helping those who help
themselves. â¢ Â¦ .
Difficulties That Were Overcome.
The difficulties in the way of using the
Income effectively, according to the. fixed
plan, are not easy to realize. Soon the
applications for. aid Â¦ were numerous,
urgent and annoying. Some were worthy,
some were dishonest, many were wildly
Utopian, and the half if granted would have
exhausted the. whole fund in less than a
year. Ingenuity and invention were put
actively at work to devise schemes for
getting hold of some of the money, which
had been magnified into untold millions.
Theorists, visionaries, sects, crazy people,
were among the persistent applicants.
Fixed rules had to be established and ad
hered to with firmness, patience, wisdom
and good temper. Work was begun by
selecting in the States a few schools at
radiating centers, to â¢ illustrate by exam
ples the best "methods of Â¦ teaching and to
exert a healthful diffusive influence "in
favor of. free schools for all citizens.
To use the apt words of Professor Har
ris of Richmond College, the idea was to
supplement judiciously and helpfully so
as "to secure the just mean between con
centration for strength and diffusion for
relief." A part of current expenses was
contributed to stimulate the people to self
exertion in the good cause, and this
amount was determined in some degree
by the amount of money raised by a
State tax, local tax or voluntary con
tributions. The aided schools were to be
graded, to have I at least 100 pupils, to
continue in session nine or ten months,
and to have free tuition. Teachers,-disci
pline, text-books and all such questions
were left to the State or local authori
ties, yet while disclaiming all purpose of
interference with the school authorities
the trustees claimed "absolute discretion"
in giving or withholding funds, refused to
distribute according to population or in
proportion^ to destitution, and were guid
ed in their action by what would be pro
ductive of beneficial results and con
tribute to the furtherance of the purpose,
which was frankly avowed and always
kept prominently Â¦ in view. All along it
was declared that this aid to independent
schools was a temporary expedient and.
that the schools must become a part of
the general system of State controlled in
stitutions, or the help would be with
drawn. '
Results of the Work.
Schoolsâ excellent, well < taught, well
managedâ sprung up throughout the
South, and the experiment was so satis
factory, good schools became so popular
and such a recognized necessity, that in
the -course of. a few years every State
had in organic law or on statute books
and in practical operation a system of
public schools modeled with some neces
sary changes upon systems which had
worked well in sister States in 'the North
and -West. AVhen these systems, were
established, as had been assiduously
worked for, the trustees no longer helped
independent schools. ( but gave their aid
only to - free schools, carried on under
State auspices, and acted in co-operation
with State educational authorities. ' For
twenty years or more not a" dollar haa
been' given to any school which has not
been, in whole Â¦ or in ; part, , under State
administration and aided by ' State I reve
nues. Â¦ . , :
The Improvement of State systems of
public schools was the next logical step.
Excellence has been rewarded j and the
income of the fund is now almost'exclu
sively used. in teacher training. The Pea
bedy Normal College at , Nashville", in
which all the Southern States are allowed
a definite number of free scholarships,
has grown to be a great institution,- with
thirty-one -teachers and 600 students, mala
and female, and receives the -major part
of the annual income of the fund. Un
der the wise and masterly management
of President Payne, this college now
ranks amons' the best of its kind in the
Union. Through the active Influence of
the agents. and the timely pecuniary co
operation of the fund, normal .schools
have been established in nearly all the
Southern State3, and to > these schools if
of a* high order and supported and con
trolled; by the State, liberal aid is given
Teachers' Institutes, held annually in the
different States under the management of
StEte Superintendents, are encouraged so
as to, furnish to the public school teach
ers, especially to those who 1 have not 1 en
joyed pedagogic ; training, -Instruction
from experts . and' the â¢" most successful
teachers who can be obtained. Some of
the States have now - several normal
schools and in this effort to increase the
qualifications ' of teachers and to require

XVII.^-SCMETHINGTHE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO DO.
x In 'February" ISSO,"the~ trustees of the
Peabody education fund presented a me
morial . to | Congress,; accompanied by a
masterly . argument/ which proceeded
from a: committee Composed of Mr. Stew
art, Chief Justice Waite and Mr. Evarts,
inviting attention "to the vital necessity
of national aid for the colored population,
and especially -to the great masses of col
ored ; children who are growing- up to be
voters under, the constitution ofVthe
United;' States."' At other sessions the
subject was. presented anew to the coun
try. The. general agent of the fund has
presented two petitions to" Congress, ap
peared three times before the Senate and
House committees on education and
urged the matter before assemDlies North
ana. South. At the late Southern Educa
tional Association in Kichmond, Va:,-the
very able and accomplished head of the
Bureau of Education, Dr. William T.
Harris, felt constrained to call the atten
tion of the , country again to this vital
subject,' this paramount issue. Hitherto
the Government has not concurred, in tne
views of tne trustee, but has cruelly and
suicidally turned a aeaf ear to arguments
which seemed, to be irresistible, and this
refusal only makes more obligatory tne
patriotic sacrifices of the Southern States.
What the Peabody Fund Has Done.
I Three results from the Peabody educa
tion tiind may be indisputably claimed:
-Â¦Firstâ State school systems have been
permanently , j established, are growing in
efficiency. every year and are more secure
ly imbedded, in -the hearts of the people.
Education is', now regarded as a function
of and no tax on property is
considered more legitimate than tnat lev
ied for the supDort of the' scnools. The
leading normal schools are the direct re
sult ot the personal influence and effort
of . the general agents and of ' timely as
sistance rendered from the fund. 1
Second â Hostility, to or prejudice
against the education of the negroes has
been largely removed or greatly softened,
r.nd this dependent class is recognized
as entitled with the white people to the
benefits of the system, to whicn by tax
ation they contribute only a.- trifle. In
thirty years the Southern States have giv
en about 5110 ,000,000 to the education of
the late slaves and their descendants.
What --Mr. Winthrop forcibly said has
grown Into a political maxim, that "slav
ery is but half abolished, emancipation is
but half completed, while millions of free
men with votes in their hands are left
without education." s
Thirdâ In Mr. Peabody's devotion to his
country there was something beautiful,
touching and assimilating. Such expres
sions as "beloved and common country,"
"our great country," "the whole of our
dear, country which IJhave loved so well,"
were ' frequently on his lips,., and his
matchless gift initiated an era of good
feeling, for it "was the earlier manifesta
tion of a spirit of reconciliation toward
those from whom," said Mr. Winthrop,
"we have been so unhappily alienated,
and against whom we of the North have
been, so recently arrayed in arms." The
indebtedness of the Northern -man, the
laborious efforts of trustees and agents,
the enlarging and elevating influence of
the "general education, of the masses, the
reflex 1 ' influence -upon higher- institutions
of learning, have -tended to efface-sec
tionalism and bring the lately belligerent
pertiens of our common country into
closer relations of friendship and fra
ternity. '
Career of George Peabody. .
George Peabody was born in Danvers,
Mass., now Peabody, Mass., February 18,
1795. His parents were, humble, but're
spectable, and his education was obtained
in a common village school. In his early
life he was compelled to work for his sup
port. This necessity took him to different
places until he found himself at George
town,, in the District of Columbia. He
removed to Baltimore and as the result
of great energy and business capacity
soon established houses in Philadelphia
ana-New York. In 1837 he took up his
abode permanently in London as a mer
chant and money where he rose
to' respect and distinction, and established
a character for business shrewdness and
integrity surpassed by none In the world's
metropolis. Living the rest of his life
in England, he was intensely an American
without loss of local attachments and per
sonal friendships. During the troublous
period of the war he was ardent In his
patriotism, and a devoted friend of the
Union. When peace was made he. was
deeply sympathetic with those who had
suffered .-most during the privations and
sorrows of the terrible struggle.
: His Great Gift to the, South.
. Mr. Peabody became renowned for his
beneficence,': which was never spasmodic
nor the result of hasty action, but con
ducted on 'fixed principles, after mature
and mosfthoughtful examination.' Before
he decided upon his munificent gift, which
made him : the greatest benefactor .the
South ever had, he considered what he
purposed with the utmost care and delib
eration, and called to his: council promi
nent men whom he had known intimately
Â¦in- public-. or business life. Among these
wore Bishop Mcllvaine, Mr. Corcoran and
Mr. Winthrop. To the last of these he
unfolded confidentially his plans with full
ness and clearness, stating that from the
tarjiest years of his manhood he had con
templated a disposition of his property
which would do great good to his fellow
men. The letter of gift finally agreed up
on shows in every -line the persuasive in
fluence-of Mr. Winthrop's statesmanlike
and comprehensive suggestions. The ani
mating principle of the gift was inscribed
upon the. seal of the fund and was given
by. him as a sentiment at the bicentennial
celebration of Danversâ "Education a
Debt Due from Present to, Future Gener
ations."
-The gifts of private persons In the
United States -for education' have sur
passed in number and amount any made
in other parts , of the - civilized world.
Rockefeller, Stanford, Carnegie, Clark,
Smith, â¢ Armour, Cupples, Brookings
Hearst, Slater, Johns Hopkins,. Colgate,
Vanderbilt. Morgan and others have en
rolled their. names among the immortals
by their large contributions, but these
have been mainly for universities, for ad
vanced education, for those able through
parents or guardians to accomplish their
honorable ambitions. Peabody. with a big
hesrt, broad American and humanitarian
views, gave to the poor, the destitute, and
declared that it was for. the promotion "of
the Intellectual, moral or industrial educa
ticn among. the youns? of- the more desti
tute portions of the Southern and South
western ; States of the Unionâ those - por
tions of our beloved and common country
which have ! suffered from the destructive
ravages and the not less disastrous conse
quences of. civil war." : Â»
' * The Value of His Gift. / ; ;
He required that the benefits of his gift
should be "distributed among- the entire
population, without; other distinction than
their needs and the opportunities of use
fulness to them." In order to appreciate
the timeliness and value . of this immense
contribution to the needs of . the people it
Is necessary to recall the fact that at the
tone of the gift the South was in a state
of apparently hopeless; impoverishment
At the close of the war corporations were
suspended,- banks were- closed,- railways
were dismantled, securities ; were depre
ciated or made â¢ valueless, business was

ATTORNEY COLLAPSES
DURING HIS ADDRESS
Counsel in D af enbach Case Faints and
Is Restored by His
Client.
CHICAGO, June 7.â John J. McDonald,
chief counsel for Dr. August M. Unger,
the principal defendant in the Defenbach
insurance swindling case, while address
ing the jury to-day in Judge Tuley's
court, without a word of warning sud
denly fell forward on thÂ£ bar and lapsed
into a state of unconsciousness. It was
feared for a time the attack might prove
fatal to the young lawyer and former
Judge and Congressman, but Unger, the
prisoner, after an hour's work finally suc
ceeded in reviving McDonald.
The stroke that laid low the counselor
followed a passionate declaration charg
ing Francis Wayland Brown and Frank
H. Smiley, -with being- equally guilty with
his client. Dr. Unger. if the latter was
not absolved from all blame.
The first English steel pens were sold at
30 shillings each.
Shrieks appalling in their intensity, fol
lowed by piteous moans, drew an immense
crowd to a vacant store at 1552 Market'
street yesterday. Investigation through
the windows revealed the fact that a care
worn, polka dot cat was the sole occupant
of the place. The crowd moved on, but
the 'shrieks were heard again from time
to time and other crowds gathered. - â¢
The case was reported to the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and
an officer was sent to get the cat out of the
building. There was no means of ingress
and the officer hunted up the real estate
man whose sign was on the door. He had
no key. but he said the Sheriff had it. The
Sheriff had no key, but he referred the of
ficer to the former owner. The latter said
he had no key, but he guessed the Sheriff
had one. Meanwhile two other appeals
came from the neighbors that the
charitable society protect them from the
cat.
It was time for action; further delay
might Imperil the success of the cam
paign. Followed by the office boy with a
basket in which to carry the prospective
prisoner, the officer advanced on the
stronghold, armed with the majesty of the
law and a hatchet. , The door was shat
tered and the lonesome one was rescued
and carried to the animals' home.

orphans' home in this city last April, has
lately appeared in both San Francisco and
Oakland. Her movements baffle the au
thorities, by whom she is badly wanted.
Officers are on the watch for her and the
two little boys throughout the State, and
two fond mothers are leaving no stone un
turned to recover their loved ones and
punish the kidnaper, but thus far the
anxious search has gone unrewarded.
Mrs. Silva's latest appearance was in
Oakland. She had evidently prowled
around the ' Clifford House in West Oak
land till she was assured of- safety and
then boldly entered. She went straight to
Mrs. Clifford, the foster mother of one of
the lost boys, and told her that unless the
search was abandoned at once death
would be the penalty. The boy, she
boasted, was safely beyond reach and
Mrs. Clifford would never see him again.
Telling Mrs. Clifford "that is all you
will ever see or hear of him," she threw
down a photograph of herself and boy and
left the house. The woman disappeared
as suddenly and mysteriously as she came
and pursuit was unavailing. She was again
seen in a Pacific-street dive/ but subse
quent search proved fruitless. It is
rumored that she has gone to Merced and
the officials have been warned. No trace
of the boys has been found since their dis
appearance nearly two months ago.

Ultimatum Sent to Lawson.
The reply to the last communication
from Lawson was sent to Boston to-night
and was as fellows:
Thomas Lavreon: Your letter of June a was
ieoeiÂ»e<l this mornlngr. "The paper Inclosed
therewith, consisting of an instrument signed
hy you and & copy of a letter addressed to
you by counsel whose name is not disclosed,
ire hereby returned to you. the committee
having notified you on June 3 that it did not
O*-sirc you to submit to them a form of any
charter you might propose to make. Through
out the entire correspondence this committee
has been anxious to believe that you had no
other object than to avail yourself of such
reasonable regulations as might be necessary
to qualify the Independence to compete for
the honor of defending the cup. and they have,
therefore. In spite of many things in your
letters to whlcn exception might have been
â¢ taken, treated you Â¦with uniform courtesy.
Your last letter, however, with the inclosures,
indicates a settled purpose on your part to
misunderstand the position of the committee
which has been again and again stated to you
in term* too plain to be open to any but will
ful misconstruction. It is evident that further
discussion can nerve no useful purpose, and
the committee, therefore, must decline to pur
sue the subject further with you. If a mem
ber of this club notifies the secretary that he
has chartered the Independence, or that he has
accepted a transfer of her. It will be for such
member to enter her for such events as she
may be qualified to enter.
LEWIS CASS LEDYARD,
' . Chairman.
POSTON, June 7.â Mr. Lawson was seen
at his home to-night and he simply said
he would have nothing to say until the
letter of the New York Yacht Club com
mittee should reach him.
Offer Made of a Charter.
NEW TORK, June 7.â Thomas W. Law
son's yacht, the Independence, will not
be allowed to compete in the trial races
preliminary to the races for the Amer
ica's cup unless she shall be chartered by
some member of the New York Yacht
Club, who will enter her for such events
as. she may be qualified to take part In.
After a meeting of the challenge com
mittee to-day it was decided to return
Lavson his proposition to charter the In
dependence to a number of New York
Yacht Club men who compose the chal
lenge committee. The correspondence was
given out to-night by Secretary Oddle. On
May 23 Lawson wrote to Commodore
Lewis Cass Ledyard, saying he would at
once charter, an Interest in the indepen
dence to such person or persons as might
be agreeable to the New York committee
and would give such person or persons
full controlÂ«H.nd management of her dur
ing the match. Ledyard, replying on May
2S. said:
Any member of this club to whom you may
elect to charter your yacht by a charter which
will vest in him or* them during its term the
full control and management mentioned in
your letter would be a person or persons
agreeable to this committee. If you will refer
to my letter of May 10. you will find that this
matter has already been fully explained to
you.
Lawson, writing May 29, says he has in
structed his counsel to draw up a form
of charter, which he will submit to Led
yÂ«rd, who replies, under date of June 3,
that it will not be necessary to submit the
form of charter.

LAWSON'S BOAT
MM BE BURRED
i
TORONTO, Ont., June 7.â Of the three
men, Fred Lea Rice, Thomas Jones and
Frank Rutledge, extradited from Chicago
to stand trial for the robbery of a bank
in Aurora, Ont., Rife is the only sur
vivor to serve out the twenty-one years'
imprisonment to which he was sentenced
this morning.
Two tragedies have put Jones and Rut
ledge beyond the reach of the law. Jones
died from bullet wounds received in a
desperate attempt to escape from, the of
ficers who were transferring the prison
era from the courthouse to the jail last
Tuesday, and Rutledge committed sui
cide to-day by jumping from the gallery
In the jail to the stone court, thirty feet
below.
While the carriage containing Rice,
Jones and Rutledge and- two constables
was - proceeding from the courthouse to
the jail last Tuesday night an accomplice
threw three revolvers through the cab
window. The desperadoes evidently were
expecting outside help, for they acted
j promptly. Securing possession of the re
volvers, the three men opened fire upon
the constables. One constable was shot
and killed. The officers returned the fire
and Jones was wounded in the groin and
arm. He died at the hospital. A street
car conductor whose car the burglars at
tempted to board struck Rutledge on the
head with a piece of iron, knocking him
senseless. Rice surrendered.
To-day Rice and Rutledge were sen
tenced to twenty-one years' imprison
ment in Kingston penitentiary. Rutledge
was being to dinner with another
prisoner, in charge of one of the guards,
about 3 o'clock. Suddenly he made a dash
-and, springing/up the stairway, mounted
to the gallery running around the inside
of the jail, thirty feet from the floor.
Climbing over the railing he fell foremost
on the stone floor, fracturing his skull.
He was immediately taken to the hos
pital, where he died without regaining
consciousness.

BURGLAR BORES
HOLES IN DOOR
Daring Crook
in the Ad-' Â¦
edition;
Enters Residence and Gets
" Away With Valuable v
The mysterious burglar Â¦who has : been
operating in the Western Addition,-steal
ing vast quantities of silverware, "con
tinues to enter, houses regardless : of the
extraordinary j efforts taken : by | the police
to arrest \ him. V His latest victim is Ben
jamin Lehman,' who with his family oc
cupies a fine residence 7". at 1511 Gough
street.' - * . ~ -â¢
While the members of the Lehman fam
ily ! were asleep ' last Tuesday night Â¦ the
desperate ; crook bored at least twenty
eight, holes in the side door and then In
serting* his hand : in the aperture X pulled
back the bolt. He had first attempted to
pry open the door with a "jimmy."-Fail
ing in his attempt to dislodge the lock, he
used a small brace and bit, cutting a hole
BUificiently large, to admit his hand.' ,
After entering : the house the burglar
went to the dining room and .with the aid
of his "jimmy" he broke open a large
sideboard which contained the family
plate* valued at about $400. After helping
himself to the | most Â¦ expensive articles of
silverware ; the marauder . went into the
adjoining room and proceeded to search
It â¢ for valuables. â¢<Â¦ Not â¢ finding anything
worth taking he started to leave the
house, when : he saw three hats hanging
on i a hatstand in the hallway. - Taking
them into the back parlor he tried 1 them
on, and as they did not fit his head, pre
sumably, he cast them aside. . -
While examining the silverware to make
sure that it - was genuine the burglar
therein opened the shutters on the; front
windows to allow the moon to shine Into
the room. By this light he had little dif
ficulty in distinguishing the genuine sil
verware from the less valuable.
â¢Shortly after. the burglar had-left Mr.
Lehman was awakened by a - pet dog
prowling about in the house. Thinking
that the side door had b'een left open by
the servant, allowing the dog to enter, he
dressed himself and went downstairs to
make an investigation. As he entered the
dining room he was startled to find that
the sideboard had been broken into and
the silverware taken. He lost no time in
communicating with the police, Informing
them of the burglary. \ r-.v
Captain Seymour has had nearly his
entire staff of detectives looking for the
burglar since then, but thus far they have
been unable to get a trace of him. ..: Dur
ing the past two weeks the same man has
entered at least a dozen houses in that
immediate vicinity, stealing much . valu
able property. Detectives Dinan and
Wren, who are working on the burglary
of the Lehman residence, are. satisfied
that the culprit is the same individual
who entered the house of Rabbi Nieto on
Bush street several nights ago and got
away with a lot of silverware.
Mistaken for a Burglar.
Herman Lukherath, who was arrested
on suspicion of having murdered Robert
Hislop Jr. and who was afterward -.re
leased for want of evidence, was arrested
early yesterday morning on. a charge of
drunkenness. He was found prowling
around in the vicinity' of Grove and Web
ster streets by two policemen, who, think
ing he was - a burglar, determined to
watch him. After following him for sev
eral blocks and realizing that he was not
bent on house-breaking, the- officers de
cided to arrest him for drunkenness. He
was held in the City Prison until 8 o'clock
yesterday morning, when he was released
along with a bunch of other inebriates.
Burglars Enter Cigar Store.
The police are looking for a brace of
crooks "who have, been "working" the
stores along Kearny street. Last Thurs
day morning they broke into the Mirror
cigar store at 210 Kearny street and stole
a quantity of cigars and cigarettes.. On
the same night they attempted to gain
an entrance to the Elite saloon on Union
Square avenue, near Kearny, with the aid
of a "jimmy," but were frightened off be
fore they succeeded in forcing open the
door. . â¢ â¢ :
Allowed the Burglar to Escape.
? Several nights ago burglars entered two
houses on Oak street, but were frightened
away ' before . they could secure anything
of value. While trying to enter the resi
dence of J. Woods, who lives Â¦ on Oak
street, near Devisadero, one of the bur
glars w* discovered and held a prisoner.
He claimed that he had mistaken the
house for his own, and . offered to prove
that he was not a burglar by some letters
which he had in his possession. > Woods,
at his suggestion, took him to a street
light, where -he pretended to read a let
ter which, he claimed, he had received
from his '.mother in New York. Â¦' While
Woods was intently listening to a few af
fectionate passages in the letter the crook
took> to his heels and . made his escape.
Captain Seymour believes that the fellow
is one of the two crooks who\ have 'been
operating in that- neighborhood.'- 'Â¦ .

that Clark promised that If the election re
sulted successfully he would reward Cav

patronage.'
The Supreme Court refers to the record
of the previous trial where these questions
are discussed. It is shown that when Cav
anaugh was on the witness stand he was
asked by Mr. Shim, Bradley's attorney, If
he and Clark had ever discussed the ex
penditure of this $1900 for election pur
poses. Cavanaugh refused to reply; on the.

The Supreme Court then affirms the
judgment. of the lower court, which dis
missed the matter of hiring carriages and
buying banners and also the contention
of Clark not having vouchers for ttae sum
of $22 65 devoted to sunarles and inciden
tals during the campaign. , . . â¢' ,
Judgment Partly Affirmed.
Mayor Clark contends that .under the
constitution of the State he is not com
pelled to take oath as to his expenditures,
and he is supported in that contention by
the Supreme Court, under section 3, ar
ticle XX, of the constitution, which says:
â¢Members of the Legislature and all of
ficers except such inferior officers as may
be by law exempted shall, before they en
ter upon the duties of their respective of
fices, take and subscribe to the following
oath or affirmation"â regulation oath fol
lows â "and no other oath, declaration or
test shall be required as a qualification for
any office or public trust." The term
"qualification" is held to mean acts per
formed after election, as taking official
oath and executing the official bond. The
purity of elections act requires an af
fidavit attached to the list of expenditures
for election purposes, which is wholly out
side the law as set forth in the constitu
tion. . . * -
The suit was brought by W. H. Bradley,
an elector of Sacramento in the' municipal
election. In the lower court judgment was
entered for Clark and Bradley appealed.'
Bradley charged that Clark secured his
election by improper practices, violatlve of
the purity of elections act. The spe
cific accusations are that Mayor Clark did
not file a statement of election expenses,
suj.ported by; his oath as required by law;
that the statement he filed was false; that
money was spent illegally by him for elec
tion purposes; that he expended an
amount in excess of that allowed by law,
and that to secure his election he promised
one-ninth of the' municipal patronage to
C. W. Cavanaugh. , .- . '[
THE contestants of G. W. Clark's
right to office as Mayor of Sacra
mento have finally, scored a point
in the decision handed down by the
Supreme Court yesterday. . This
decision declares that C. W. Cavanaugh,
who was. upheld by the lower, court in a
refusal to testify concerning certain mat
ters "connected with. Mayor Clark's elec
tion, can be compelled to do so at the new
trial which has been ordered. If Cav
anaugh's testimony is to be of the nature
he intimated at the former trial, it is pos
sible that Mayor Clark's office may be
rendered vacant. ,

In very serious Jeopardy previous to the
decision of the Supreme Court, and should

possible, no change will be made.' ""
The decision- was . rendered by Justice

Temple," Van Dyke and Harrison concur

dissent. Their opinion is as follows: -
The Supreme Court then cornea to" the
vital pointâ should Cavanaugh have been
compelled to testify and shall a new trial
be ordered, where he will be forced to
make statements .which he had intimated
in his previous plea would prove most
prejudicial to himself and the Mayor?
The' Supreme Court decided that a new
trial must be held and that Cavanaugh
must answer the questions he refused to
answer before.
The case of Cavanaugh was a test. Its
settlement means that the others who
were concerned with him will also have
to testify, and thereon lies the hope of
the;"Land" faction that Mayor Clark will
be ousted f pom office. , Â».
In making this important decision the
Supreme Court quotes from section 32 of
the purity, of elections act, which pro
vides that. a witness is not liable to pun
ishment even If he admits his own guilt
in trials regarding fraudulent elections.
As he would not have suffered if guilty
and certainly not if innocent, his refusal
to answer was. improper and the support
given by the trial Judge was erroneous.
Clark maintains that Bradley's attor
neys concede that Cavanaugh's answer
would have been incriminating, and that
the Supreme Court . is bound under the
law to admit that concession, erroneous
or not. It is, held, however, after a dis
cussion of the alleged concession that its
intent' was otherwise. For these reasons'
the : judgment of the lower court is re
versed and the cause remanded for a new
trial. '. - . : ,-. Â¦ :.. . â¢
Cavanaugh Must Testify/
The Supreme Court shows that under
the law Clark could have spent in his
election $300 only and that proof of the
expenditure of $1900 would therefore dis
qualify him from office. Clark's official
account showed a perfectly legal expen
diture of $289 15. The law is reviewed then
to show that Clark would, be subject to
fine and imprisonment, as well as loss of
office, if -the further allegations are
proved to be true.

criminate himself. His answer, he
averred, might degrade his character and
convict him of felony. Attorney Shim
asked that Cavanaugh be compelled tjJTe

refusal and exception was taken. - Cavan
augh .was then asked if he had j received
money from Clark or an agent. For the
same reasons he refused to answer and he
was again supported by the Â¦ court. . Fur

The complaint recites that while Harde
and others were hoisting a heavy stick of
timber out of the hold of the schooner,
Captain Johansen caught hold of one end
of the stick while it was swinging and
gave It a jerk, causing It to fall upon
Harde, breaking his left arm. Harde called
to his fellow workmen to llftup the end
of the timber that was crushing him, but
Captain Johansen ordered the men to roll
the timber away. They obeyed the order
with the result that Harde's left wrist was
broken. . â¢
Bernhard Harde filed a maritime libel
yesterday in the United States District

United States Secret Service Agent Ha
zen and Operator Harry Moffitt arrested
George Werner and Charles Kewltz yes
terday on a charge of making a mold and
die for the manufacture of counterfeit
dollars. The alleged offense was com
mitted In the fall of 1898. Kewltz got
away before the officers could 'arrest him,
and since then he has been to Seattle,
Alaska and Los Angeles, arriving from
the last named place a day or two ago.
He made a full confession to Agent Ha
zen. . He said that while in the saloon
business on Bush street three years ago
a stranger made a proposition to him to
make counterfeit dollars and advanced
?150 to have the steel die made. Werner
is a wood carver and volunteere& to get
a ateel engraver to do the work. There
was a disagreement between Kewitz and
Werner as to' his commission, pending
which the stranger disappeared, and there
being no more money In sight the die was
left unfinished.

Because v of statements made in the

long and too often, Captain Cushing. be

The Collector will not call the attention
of the authorities at Washington to â¢ this
alleged . breach of Interofflcial etiquette
upon the high seas or on the inland wat
ers of the State,' and the incident was de
clared closed until the next time.
The Collector sent j for Surveyor ' Spear
anrl asked him. for an explanation. Mr.
Spear, drew Â» the. Collector's attention to a
note signed' by Deputy . St. John on the
back', of one of. Captain-. Bermingham's
cards in refutation â¢ of the charges made
by tho. incensed commander, of the rev
enue j cutter. . ' The note was addressed to
one of the customs â¢ inspectors on board
an incoming passenger steamer, request
ing the inspector to allow Captain Berm
ingham to board the steamer and to ex
tend the usual courtesies to him. . - The
note was not addressed to Captain Cush

decided that he had "no kick coming"
and that he had been shooting at a

TRAMP STEAMSHIPS COMING.
THE. Palena of the Compania Sud
Americana de Vapores Jine sailed
for Central and South American
ports yesterday. She took away
a large and valuable cargo and a
number of passengers. Among those who
departed on the steamship were G. W.
Colvig, who will be United States Consul
at Barranquilla, United States of Colom
bia, and . T. Isaka. a leading Japanese
merchant of Callao. Peru. Another pas
senger is Seig-uma Kitsuani. A large por
tion of the steamship's cargo belongs to
him, and with it he intends starting a
general merchandise house in Peru.^ The
Palena was late in -getting away, owing
to a quantity of freight arriving at the
last moment. The Colombia, the next
vessel of the line, will be due here next
Wednesday. The Palena's passengers are:
Jaka Havilar.d. T. Tanaka, Dr. A. L. Mor
rill. Juan Taraayo, Severiano Tamayo, Ra
phael Diaz. Francisco Diaz, Mrs. Van Zant
and children. George S. Allen. M. P. McDon

to-day. About twenty of the delegates
were presented to the Lord Mayor and
were shown over the Mansion House. A
number of members of the London Cham
ber of Commerce, including Lord Bras-
Bey and Sir Albert K. Rollit, were pres
ent Among others were Rear Admiral
Erben, U. S. N., and Sir Hiram Maxim.
The Lord Mayor addressed the Ameri
cans, thanking them in the warmest terms
for their visit and declaring that nothing
could have done more to' promote a per
fect understanding and unity between the
two greatest nations of the world. He
alluded to Morris K. Jessup's reference
in his speech at the banquet Wednesday
to the impossibility of jealous rivalry ex
isting between the United States and
Great Britain as one of the truest things
Â«ver said. Lord Brassey spoke in a" sim
ilar strain. Jessup, in replying, said:
"Your kindness has captivated our
hearts. We are not worthy of it."
Loud cries of "No!" in which some of
the Americans joined followed this re
mark of Mr. Jessup.
Jessup then referred to his fellow dele
gates as "children of this great country,"
and concluded with expressions of fervent
thanks for their reception. The Lord
Mayor then proposed the healths of King
Edward and President McKinley, coup
ling with the latter a heartfelt wish for
Mrs. McKinley's recovery.
Andrew Carnegie was the center of at
traction throughout. After the ceremo
nies the Lord Mayor went up to him and
said he especially wanted to shake hands
with Carnegie, who said:
"In New York, in my young and poor
day, when I read about Dick Whitting
ton. I little thought I should stand here
shaking the Lord Mayor's hand."
The Lord Mayor replied:
"We read nothing else to-day but of
Carnegie's splendid gifts, and in the name
of the English people I want to thank you
for your unexampled generosity."
The delegates were then entertained at
an informal luncheon in Salters by the
London Chamber of Commerce. â¢ 1

skin - diseases, says dandruff is a germ

scalp, throwing up little scales of cuticle,
and sapping the vitality of the hair, at the
root.' The only hair preparation that kills
dandruff germs Is Newbro's Herpicide.

did not see a -car which was coming
rapidly in an opposite direction to the one
on which he was riding and stepped â¢ di

lently to the ground-. His skull was frac
tured and, his right j leg broken in two
places. He was. removed at once , to the
Railroad Hospital, where he has since re
mained In an- unconscious condition. An
operation was performed on him '. yester*
day afternoon for the removal of a portion
of the bone of the skull, which it was
thought was pressing on the brain. Al
though the operation was successful very
little hope Is entertained for. his recovery.
MUTING MATT- STRUCK
BY AN" ELECTRIC CAR
A Former Resident of Placer County
Receives Injuries Which May Â¦
Prove Fatal, j
Charles' Albrecht. who Tor forty-five
years was a prominent mining man and
Mr. ; Palmieri came to this country
twenty years ago, and accumulated quite
a fortune. He was born in Volterra, Italy,
in 1854. Many of" his relatives still restde
there, 1 but his widow is the only surviving
relative in this .country. . , .â¢ ' *
The persons who had been treating him
could not sjgn a .death certificate. I and
when" the two doctors who' had been at
tending him were asked to do so they.de
clined. They knew . he had died of ery
sipelas, but they had, not attended' him
within twenty- four hours of his death, so
they would not or could not sign the cer
tificate. The matter was brought to the at
tention of the Coroner, who took charge
of the case. There will be an inauest.
The immediate cause of death is given as
heart failure. - " . . . . '
Eglsto" C. Palmieri, ex-State Senator,
president of the Italian Chamber of Com
merce, prominent in Italian and business
circles and one of the best known men of
his nationality in the" city, died early yes
terday morning of erysipelas after an ill
ness of eight days. His death was a pecu
liar one and on account of the refusal of
the attending physicians to certify to the
cause of death the case was reported to
the attention of the Coroner.
Mr. Palmieri was a member of the firm
of J. F. Fugazi & Co., agents for the Ital
ian line* of trans- Atlantic steamers, and
he was at his desk In his office when he
was taken suddenly ill Friday, a week
ago. * He went home and rapidly grew
worse until finally Dr. C. Barsotti was
called in to attend . him. Dr. Barsotti
found 'the patient had erysipelas and he
called In Dr. Osea Perone to consult with
him. The two physicians decided that the
best thing to be done was to shave the
hair and mustache of the sick man and
cover his face with a mask, as is done in
cases of erysipelas, but neither the
patient, his wife nor an old friend of the
family named', Delflno, who was present,
would agree to such treatment* and the
two physician** left the house | and the
patient. Â¦ . . '
Â¦ There is among Italians a belief or
superstition regarding the treatment of
erysipelas, "which- Includes much of the
faith cure method, besides the application
of hot cloths and copious drafts of cold
water. This treatment was applied, but
the patient rapidly failed under it and
yesterday morning he died.. â¢

SEIZE MINES
OF AMERICANS
Canadians Tike Advan
tage of New Bound-
ary Location.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B.C., June 7.-PJval
claim-Jumpers with fast horses to reach
the nearest recording office made a de
cidedly tropical time of it on both sides
of the, boundary line at Mount Baker this
morning. For a year and more the boun
dary has been in dispute, and to-day the
change recently made was taken advan
tage of by twenty men, who seized mines
owned by Americans and supposed to be
on the American side, but which have
been thrown Into Canada by the reloca
tion or the boundary.
The party of boundary surveyors under
Mr. Sinclair, the American officer appoint
ed to mark the boundary, had been at
work for two weeks, and yesterday it was
announced that thÂ© line was 3500 feet far
ther south than it had been believed to
be. This meant that many American
mining companies' properties hitherto
supposed to be on American soil were,
really partly or in whole in Canada.
This . morning the entire district awoke
to the change in the nationality of own
ership. There was a run to put down dis
covery stakes on the properties. The prin
cipal mines affected were the Yellow
Jacket, owned, by J. E. McManus of Seat
tle, and the Arbutus, Star And Golden
Chariot, in which New York and San
Francisco people are interested.
The Chariot has had at least <6O,00O of
development work, and Is one of the finest
properties in the district. Two-thirds of
it is now on the Canadian* side, and a
miner "who had hurriedly "jumped" it
came down, the mountain at breakneck
speed and into Chilliwack this morning to
-record his location.' The recorder's office
was not yet open, but the man hurried
around and -found the official and soon
had j his discovery papers filed. Other
men did the same with other properties,
and altogether the trail between the mines
and ' the Canadian recording office Â¦ was
kept hot during the forenoon. â¢
Â¦J. E. McManus of Seattle and several
others of the mine owners put their hearts
together and have demanded from the
Government that satisfaction be given
and their property kept for them. A tech
nical error probably has been made in not
having the property recorded on the
Canadian side, but the real owners be
lieve the Government should protect their
interests until the location of the -lines is
finally determined and the affair adjusted
for all time. . t .
'The recorder at Chllliwack could do
nothing but accept the applications on the
payment of the proper fees, and the whole

"WTiy Brown Ones Come on -Faces. ,
When a woman can get rid of brown
patches on her face by changing her diet
It is worth while for other women who
care for their complexions to know some-
thing of the method.
A lady ir Michigan City, Ind.. who does
not want her name mentioned, says that
coffee caused the brown patches on her
face by flr6t giving her stomach trouble,
then putting: her nerves out of order, and
the result was shown in her complexion.
ghe quit coffee and began using Pos-
tum Food Coffee and in less than a month
the Etomach trouble disappeared and
within' two months her complexion cleared
up and Is now fine and rosy.
She f peaks of a Mr. Knight and Gid-
ron Hunt of Westfield, Ind., who have
both been improved in health by leaving
off coffoe and taking in its place; Postum
Food Coffee, also a Mr. and Mrs. Jesse
Stanley of the same place, who were in
â¢ poor health and suffered from stomach
trouble. They quit coffee and after using-
Postum a short time the result was nat-
ural sleep, return of appetite, and a gain
in strength as fast as nature will rebuild.
She gives the names of a number of
other persons who have been helped by
leaving off coffee and taking Postum Food
Coffee.
It is a safe proposition that if any cof-
fee user has stomach or nervous trouble,
or bad complexion, he or she can get
rid of the trouble by discontinuing coffee
taking Postum Food Coffee. It Is

Considerable ' activity developed In . the stock
market this week, although within the past
few days there was a falling off of Interest In
speculation. "together with renewed liquidation
and an. Irregular tendency In prices. The ap
proach ' of the midsummer season would ap
pear to-be largely responsible for this latter
demonstration and it cannot be said that the
market exhibits any decided weakness. In
the early days of the week there was, In fact,
a decided tone of strength and a number of
important advances were recorded throughout
the list. This was in the main the result of
the harmonization effected last week between
the Hill-Morgan and the Kuhn-Loeb Interests
In relation to Northern Pacific. Representa
tion In the Northern Pacific board is to be ac
corded, to the Union Pacific and their wishes
In regard to the management of the Burling
ton will now receive due attention. In other
respects the great -financial interests which
are parties to the treaty of peace will; , it Is
to be presumed, henceforth work In complete
accord, the principle of the community of In
terests In regard to the large Western.-rail
road systems Â¦ being again established on a
more secure footing than ever. There is also
a general feeling In , financial circles that
further combinations Â¦ of - railroad properties
may be looked for, though none of the week's
developments > has been such as to give con
firmation'to the idea. The election of Mr.

rectors, attracted a great deal of attenlon,

NEW YORK, June 7.â Bradstreet's to-morrow

Despite some Irregularity .due to special 'con
ditions, the general trade situation shows' an
improvement, owing to better weather and crop
conditions In most sections of the country. In
the East the first real week of warm weather
has been reflected in an. improved retail demand
for seasonable fabrics Â¦ and wearing- apparel,
this' in turn inducing more activity In jobbing
lines of dry goods, â¢ shoes and other products.
The same is true ' of the Northwest, where

EASTERN MARKETS.
Shipments of boots and shoes from Boston
continue very -large for the last week, exceed
ing the same week of 1900 by 20,000 cases, and
since the year opened^ forwardlngs have, been
over 2,000.000 cases, far surpassing any previous
record. /Although the movement is still heavy,
shops receive few orders, and it will be some
weeks before active work begins on fall con
tracts. Retailers are offering black goods for
summer wear at reduced prices, and it Is evi
dent that the prQductlon of these shoes was
excessive, while tan shoes have been In much
greater demand and manufacturers are pushed
to fulfill contracts. Prices are steady and Job
bers report that the better qualities are sought.
Local distribution is facilitated by the warm
weather, and this factor is even more potent
in the market for -cotton goods. Other textiles
were helped, though less - extensively.
â¢Efforts to secure advances In grain by exag
gerated reports of damage to the growing crop
have given place to more rational statements
and the outlook is generally conceded to be full
of promise. Speculative operations for a de
cline, however, are far from aggressive; - the
severe losses of the short interest thus far this
season making; traders extremely cautious. A
slight flurry In July wheat at Chicago caused
hasty covering and a sharp advance which was
of short duration, as moderate profits were
quickly taken. Â¦ Abundant production in the
United States does not necessarily mean weak
prices, for. European crops are falling below
expectations and foreign .purchases . continue
heavy; Atlantic exports for the week (flour In
cluded) amounting to 4,520,144 bushels, against
2.855,261 last year, and 1.849.373 two years ago.
Pacific exports also show good gains, reaching
854.815 bushels against 591.015 a year ago and
623.600 in 1899. Including exports at Duluth
and Portland, Me., the total outward move
ment for' the week, exclusive of Canadian
ports, was 5,646.597 bushels, against 3.S38.364
bushels last year and 2,748,467 bushels in the
same week of 1899. . \
â¢ Labor controversies have become the factor
of ' greatest importance in the leading manu
facturing industry. Counting, perhaps, upon
the heavy loss which would-* be sustained by
employers in case of suspension, the machin
ists made what were considered unreasonable
demands- by employers at many points, who
have taken a determined stand and announced
that the strikers' places will be taken by non
union men on Monday if they fall to resume
work. More quiet conditions â¢ : in the market
and few new contracts make this action possi
ble. As a rule manufacturers have not sought
business beyond July 1, and it looks as though
they had been preparing for the conflict. Pig
Iron Is extremely dull, not a sale of Bessemer
being reported during the week at Plttsburg
and quotations are nominal. Large \ contracts
for rails sustain billets and finished steel de
liveries continue. Shipments of farm machin
ery attract much attention, while bridge build
ing, new vessels and track elevation prevent
dullness In structural material.
- The cessation of manipulation In corn con
tributed to a decline of 2.1 cent in bread
stuffs. , Â¦
The labor situation in many parts of the
country is still seriously unsettled and consti
tutes a reason for hesitation In some indus
tries, discouraging new operations which satis
factory conditions .would otherwise stimulate.
But quick decision is to be expected in some
of these labor controversies, and in the mean
time trade Is encouraged by reports of a satis
factory condition of winter wheat over a large
portion of the country. As for spring wheat
the crop was put In under very favorable con
ditions and there have been few unsatisfactory
reports. Railroad earnings for May, showing 9.6
per cent In excess of 1000 and 23.2 per cent over
1899, reflect a continued activity in the coun
try, while at New York bank clearings remain
for the week 86.8 per cent over 1900 and 59.1
per cent over . 1899. with gains at the leading
cities outside Ne.w York of 27.1 per cent over
1900 and 27.5 per 'cent over 1899. . >

Harrison's circular says:
"During the week there 'have been two ar
rivals of Coal from British Columbia, 8Â«35 tons;
three from Washington. 2464; one from Oregon.
160; three from Australia. 7581; total, 13,840
tons. . We are fully 10.000 tons short of our
requirements this -week, as the demand for
steam uses Is very brisk, hence the reserve In
yard will be eaten Into. The quantity utilized
for house purposes Is very light, as the sum
mer season has fairly set In and fuel Is only
needed for stoves, not grates. Prices are un
changed, as consumers and producers seem to
be satisfied with current values. Freights on
coal from Australia and England are sottenln?
and will continue to -do so, as outward grain
freights are firm and will Improve as the sea
son-advances, but the f. o. b. prices on all
fuels In foreign ports still continue to rulÂ«
high. There was a very brisk demand for Aus
tralian six months ' ago for Honolulu. Valpa
raiso and the West Coast, which enabled them
to mark up their prices 50c tc 75c per ton and
readily dispose of - their entire output. At
present r there is . an indication of lighter de
mand Â¦ for the above ports, which may finally
lead to a decline. When this occurs we may
find colonial freely shipped In this direction.
Fuel oil Is being pumped about equal in quan
tity to Its requirement. If prices were mow
seductive a large number of wells now capped
would be furnishing considerably more."

OAKLAND, June 7.â After a pur
suit of several miles through the
Piedmont hills this morning, Dep
uty Sheriff Charles Hitchcock cap
tured an Insane man who had
for several hours terrorized the residents
of that locality. The maniac was John
Nystrom, a machinist who three weeks
ago went out on the strike at the Union
Iron Works. Before he was finally land
ed in the detention, ward of the Receiving
Hospital Nystrom overturned a buggy
with himself and Hitchcock and fought
every Inch of the way. The attendants
at the hospital had an. equally. hard: time
and Nystrom was- only quieted after a
desperate struggle.
The unfortunate man fled early this
morning half naked from the residence
of John Hendrlcksen, where he had been
stopping since the strike. Nystrom. car
ried a blanket on his arm, and ran howl
ing and yelling through the hills, kicking
and beating upon* doors and windows,
awakening the occupants and spreading
alarm over the country. Hitchcock got
on his trail and started in pursuit on
horseback. Nystrom outstripped his
pursuer by crossing lots and back yards
until he reached Perry street,- south of
Linda Vista 'Terrace. There "William
Wehr, a newspaper carrier, joined in the
chase and Nystrom was captured and
overpowered. He gave the men a fight
as they placed him in Wehr's team, and
thj buggy was overturned. In the mix
up Nystrom escaped, but was soon re
captured. Hlchcock and his prisoner then.
smarted for town. By the time the hos
pltal was reached the big deputy sheriff
was nearly exhausted from-his struggles
with his violent companion. Warden Page
and. Steward Borchert. took charge of the
patient, but had hardly placed him in
ward before he made a leap at Page's
throat. The attendants had a hard strug
gle to overpower him. There was no rest
at the hospital Â¦ until Nystrom had been
put under the restraint of heavy leather
straps and muffs. Nystrom. according to
Hendricksen, had been acting strangely
for' several days. He aroused his host
by his yells this morning and th'en rushe 1

J. C. Davis, employed at the California
Car "Works," at Second and Townsend
streets, as night watchman, was 3hot at
twice last night by parties unknown. The
first shot did no harm, but the second
shattered the lantern he held In his hand.
Davis then emptied his revolver In the
direction from which the shots came. Be
ing In the dark his aim was uncertain,
and &s & result he missed the miscreants.
Davis tells a straight story of the oc
currence. He said last night:
"The shooting occurred about 9:30. I
was making my rounds and I was near
the King-street entrance to the works
when suddenly I heard a shot. It sounded
pretty close and I Jumped to one ktde, at
the same tlmo pulling my revolver from
my pocket. Hardly had I succeeded in
setting my revolver out when a second
shot was fired, and the lantern I held in
my hand was struck by the bullet. It
was shattered to atoms and, of course, I
was left In the dark.
"There Is a big hole under the gate on
Kins street, and I suspected that who

General Grant said that the friars were

to treat the friars the same as any other
persons, with no more consideration, and
with no less. Â¦ â¢ : Â» Â¦
Aguinaldo was not as much of a capture in
the Philippines as he seems to have been here.
To tell UTe truth he had lost about all his in
fluence. We do not treat him as if we con
sidered him of some importance. We cannot
kill him, of course, but we want to make him
feel that he stands on the same footing with
any other Filipino. - If we should fine him $10
and send him to Jail for thirty days and set
him to breaking rocka it would be better for
him and for ourselves. If, when he comes over
here, we treat him with contempt, he will be
treated with contempt by the natives when he
g-oes home. But if over there they pet the idea
that we have a high idea of Agrulnaldo's im
portance when he gets back he will have a fol
lowing which may make us trouble.

"The wholesalers are a unit on this
proposition. We do not know what the
unions will do In the premises, or wheth
er they will make any move at all.- Of
course, the withdrawal of the union card
leaves the proprietor free to accept the
union scale, just as Becker in this city
has done and as many other butchers
might do.
"So the unions may or may not take ac
tion. All I can say is that we are pre
pared to back our request concerning the
cards. I apprehend that a majority of
the retailers will send back the cards as
soon as they hear from the wholesalers."
The Journeymen Butcners* Union â¢ to
night took action on the wholesalers' de
mands by declaring a strike at noon to
morrow in all shops where the union card
is not displayed and the union agreement
on hours has not been â¢ signed. -The
butchers' union claims that.it has-been
forced to this action by the demands from
the wholesale butchers that the cards be
pulled down. There are eight shops out
of 220 that have not signed the agreement
and a number "have already withdrawn
the union card. The ' union meeting-to
night was attended by 300 members, and
the vote to strike unless the union condi
tions are met was unanimous. This ac-
"There has already been considerable
attention given to our request," said Irv
ing C. Lewis of Grayson, Owen & Co.,
the wholesale butchers, to-night. "We
have made no threats nor have we at
tempted any intimidation. After the
wholesalers learned of certain threats
which the Journeymen's union. had made,
and had ascertained thai retailers were
being stood up too hard by the union, we
simply decided that we would formulate
our recommendation that the official
recognition of the union by the display
of the card be dispensed with, and that
our customers might know the sentiment
existing we sent each one of them a polite
note to cover the situation.
The requests from the wholesalers have
been circulated very quietly. In fact
there has been no desire on the part of
any of the interested wholesale or retail
dealers to make any unnecessary ado
about the matter. The wholesalers ex
pect a practically unanimous recognition
of their request. They claim that there
wlll.be that result as soon as the entire
retail trade ha3 been notified concerning
the attitude of the supply houses.
The action of the wholesalers was
taken at a conference In San Francisco
three days ago. They voted unanimously
to send out this request, as it is diplo
matically termed by the officials of the
wholesale organization. The recommen
dation was embodied in the form of a per
sonal letter from each wholesale house
on both sides of the bay to each of its
customers where the union shop card had
been displayed. The retailers were re
quested to dispense with the cards, which
signified an official recognition of the
Journeymen Butchers* Union. That union
recently enforced a new schedule of
hours and of wages, which has been
adopted by the butcher shops In Oakland,
Alameda and Berkeley with hardly a sin
gle exception.

United States Attorney Wood-worth
to Prosecute Union Iron Works.
Owing to the recent decision of United
State District Judge de Haven sustaining
the demurrer of the Union Iron Works
in the suit brought by Labor Secretary
Edward Rosenberg to recover $1000 pen
aHy for importing a coppersmith from
Sweden, United States Attorney Wood
vÂ«,rth. with the sanction of the labor or
ganizations, has consented to the dls
miFfcal of that and seven other similar
suits against the Union Iron Works. The
dismissal was ordered yesterday "without
prejudice," and Mr. Woodworth will file
tight new suits against the Union Iron
\Yorks, naming the same coppersmiths
from Sweden and Scotland as the artisans
in'pcrted In violation, as alleged, of the
a'itn contract law. The new suits will be
brought In the name of, and on behalf of,
the United States, and the penalty of $1000
in each case will be demanded to be paid
into the treasury of tne United States. "
The original suits were brought on be
hslf of Secretary Rosenberg and the com-
I-Ia'nts asked that the penalties should be
j'cid to him. It was for that reason that
Judge de Haven sustained the demurrer.

that any person might bring suit in such
cases, such suits should be on behalf of
the United States and all penalties should
be paid into the treasury of the United

Appeals for financial assistance for

Federation of Labor, which will meet on
the first Sunday in July, and to all unions
affiliated, with the American Federation of
J-sbor. which has jurisdiction throughout
the United States. Seme opposition
against tl'is proposition was manifested
last night at the regular meeting of the
Â£an Francisco Labor Council, but when
Secretary Rosenberg explained the needs
of the strikers the resolution was finally
Â«.-;; Tried.
"San Francisco and Cincinnati are the
rrcat strike centers of the country,'' said
Rosenberg:. "We have not got
Â« nough from the voluntary assessment of
.i cents per capita levied a few weeks ago
to .Kupfwrt or Icei the 4000 men now out
<>n strike in the various branches of the
industries affected. A crisis is being
reached and we must be in position to
support trade unionism or our labor of
\vars will fail."
Delegates from the Iron Trades Council
stiso made a similar appeal, and after a
somewhat acrimonious debate It was de
rided to send out a request for prompt re
mittances of funds. It is estimated that
at least $10,<X)0 a week will be required to
keep those now en strike from suffering
the pangs of hurger.

news and Interest as an egg of meat.
From cover to cover there is not a dull
line. The "Looker On" Is especially long
and replete with new stories on the things
and people of the week. "Mere Gossip "
by Betsie : Bird. - furnishes a full . pag-e of
society news that reads like fiction. "Ella
Wilier Wheelcox" has a poem on love
and a touching discourse on prizefighting.
Robert McTavIsh has contributed a
budget of streetcar stories and the satir
ical .wit of the "Town Crier" is above par.
Jasper AI-'Donald has a Hm el- open let
ter on Golden Gale Park and Mr. Gar
nett'js. 1 dramatic criticism is up to- its
usual high "standard. , â¢
. Another instance of the lax methods em
ployed in the office of the City Treasurer
was uncovered yesterday by. Auditor
Wells. That official ascertained that a
demand of the Hermann Safe Company
calling for $374.50 was . paid by Deputy
Treasurer, Reis without ' being counter
sighed, though" the "charter provides that
no demands shall be paid by the Treasurer
unless audited by the Auditor.
The demand was d^awn on the fund for
"Subsistence of Prisoners," though the
"work done by the safe company consisted
of putting in a lining in the vault In
stalled in the Sheriff's office. When the
demand was presented to .the Auditor a
week ago he declined to audit it, as it was
drawn by the Board of Public Works on
the wrong fund. Wells said he could only
audit the demand out of the maintenance
fund, ' which is exhausted. The demand
was returned without â¢ approval \ to the
Board of Public . Works, under N whose
supervision the work was done. That
board turned the demand over to Sheriff
Lackmann, who gave it to a representative
of the safe company with the advice -that
he Bee the Auditor with a view to per
suading him to sign the demand. Instead
of taking the advice the representative
presented the demand ; - to > Paying Teller
Reis and received his money.
* Auditor Wells has not yet decided what
he will do in the premises, but he promises
to.' devise some plan to help the Treas
.urer's office : out of its- dilemma. The
Auditor refers to another Instance of care
lessness when -a demand for $20, â signed
by the foreman of the Grand Jury, was
paid without | question, though the Su
pervisors should have countersigned it.
' People â¢ who â¢ have demands for bail
moneys are still unable- to cash them. The
Auditor, has been pestered with a number
of-holders to. sign .the demands, but/act
ingr under the advice of his attorney, he
refuses to have anything to do with them.
In return for the annoyance to which he
has been subjected . "Wells refers the ap
plicants to the Mayor, and the latter's
office has been besieged by a small army
of people who want their bail money back.
The Auditor takes 'exception to the
Treasurer making no return to his office
regarding the commissions on collateral
inheritance tax collection, which the State
law says shall go to the Treasurer. The
collections, according- â¢â¢ to Treasurer De
Greayer, amount to $62,048.17, of which
$2748.79 is now deposited In the vault as a
special fund until the Supreme Court shall
decide if a city official is entitled toffees
outside of his salary. De Greayer; says
that the city has nothing to do with the
commissions. " it being a matter between
Treasurer Brooks and the State. He says
the polltax commissions, amounting to
$29,365.05. are -in a different category and
return thereof Is made to the Auditor.

(Attest) . THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Â¦ GEORGE J. CAMPBELL JR., Secretary!
The Chamber of. Commerce of the city
of Vallejo is taking active steps to secure
the 'work of repairs on ships of the navy
for the workmen of the Mare Island
Navy Yard. It is claimed -by the. Cham
ber of Commerce that Influence has been
brought to â¢ bear so that | repair work
which should come to Mare Island Navy
Yard is diverted to Eastern yards.
The attention . of the Secretary of the
Navy was called to -the -facilities of the
Mare Island yard when . that â¢ official "was
here and a new board of yards and docks
was appointed to adjust 4lie differences
that exist between the Government and
the contractors for the new docks at Val
lejo, as the dispute has retarded the con
struction of the docks. " - ; 'â¢. :
Yesterday the Chamber of Commerce
of Vallejo forwarded resolutions > to -the
Secretaries of the i Navy and -War De
partments, asking that, ships now home
ward bound be sent to the navy yard at
Mare Island for repairs./ Â¦ . â¢
The California delegation- in Congress
has also been asked to take steps in the
matter, 1 and each member has received a
copy of the resolutions, which are as
follows: â¢ ' : :
â¢Whereas, ' The Navy Department had' order
ed the â¢ Baltimore, Newark, I Olympia, Cincin
nati and the Brooklyn, to the Mare Island
Navy Yard, which orders were subsequently
revoked and said ships sent Â¦ to the . Eastern
yards for repairs: and : ....-Â¦. . Â¦â¢Â¦-â¢. Â¦
Whereas, The Mare - Island * Navy Tard Is - a
first-class yard, and is as fully equipped j to
build and repair ships as : anv â¢ other, yard In
the United States..- That the -quality .of. the
new work and the repair 'work done at said
yard is second to none in the United States,
as the records of the Navy Department Â¦will
show; also that the work is done cheaper
and better at the Mare Island Navy Yard than
it . is done in any other, yard in i the United
States: and
Whereas. The Navy Department's policy of
sending only third - and fourth I class ships to
Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs is work-
City Attorney Lane advises the Mayor
In answer to a Question whether the ob
ligation for work done in any fiscal year
is assumed prior to the letting of a'con
tract that no obligation arises prior to
the letting of the contract. The issuance
of a notice calling for bids at this time
would not fix the liability against the
funds of this year if the contract la
awarded in the next fiscal year.

â¢â¢Minister "Wu Ting Fang at "Washington
and Consul General HÂ« Yow at San Fran
cisco played a* diplomatic game of whist
a few days ago, and 1 , now they want to
renege. '. '
Customs Collector Stratton received a
telegram May 31 from the Secretary of
the Treasury to land and extend, the of
ficial courtesies, to three Chinese dignita
ries who arrived on the City of 'Peking.
Ho Yow in his official robes went to the
Mail, dock and'took the distinguished
gentlemen to the consulate in a carriage.
They were Su Shih Chin, a bachelor of
arts from 'the Peking University: Loo
Chin An, a Taotal or Deputy Commis
sioner of Commerce, and Siep Sung Yung,
a law graduate of the University of Tien
tsin. It was represented that these gen
tlemen had been commissioned by the
Chinese Government to study "Western
commerce, finances and , civilization gen
erally.'.' \'~'i\
The gentlemen had not been long on
American soil before a Chinese newspaper
announced that ;they were revolutionists
and rebels against the Government of
China and that they nad come hither un
der false representations.
Then Ho Yow filed with the Collector
the following protest:
Last week three Chinese named respectively
Su Shih Chin, designated. I believe, as trav
eler Loo Chin An and Slep Sung Tung, ar
rived here on the steamship Peking holding
alleged certificates or passports purporting to
have been issued to them by Chinese authorl-
We at that time, j thinking them bona flde
Chinese officials, made representations to the
State and Treasury Departments In Washing
ton D. C. through our Minister, on their be
half to , facilitate their., landing, and instruc
tions were accordingly sent you by the Treas
ury Department to land them as Chinese offl
Â° On : examining Into their cases we have found
that -at least one ofÂ« them, the above named
Su Shih, Chin, la not a bona flde Chinese offi
cial nor as he was designated in the passport
which he 'holds;' so we beg to: withdraw our
statements . or representations : on his behalf
entirely - and. further : make the following
charges" against him and his right to be ad
mitted into or stay in the United States. He
obtained his passport, even If it were genuine,
by fraud and : misrepresentation. His papers
or passport are irregular, illegal and not gen
uine He has " misrepresented himself to us.
He obtained his landing or admittance to the
Â¦United States by fraud and misrepresentation.
He is not what he is ' represented or signified
to be in -his papers. He is now Illegally In
this . country â¢ (especially after we have with
drawn our â¢ vouch ' for him) and ought Â¦ to at
once be subjected to the law.'
In conclusion , I have to ask you to at once
consider and investigate these charges and to
take him under your custody pending his full
examination. I' hear his papers or passports
are now in 'Â¦ your ' hands, and Â¦ I Â¦' must i respect
fully request that they should not be given "to
him until his case and right thereto have been
thoroughly Investigated, or^ hold â¢them as evl-
Should : you * decide â¢ the case , and charges, or
any part thereof. In his favor, I beg and claim
the - privilege Â¦, of appealing Â¦Â¦ the whole case to
the Treasury Department , In "Washington, D.
C and hope you will then send It up there,
together with my charges and all other evi
dences. Tours respectfully." , HO TOW.

MINISTER WU
SCENTS TREASON
The ICational Association of Railroad
Commissioners was in session all yester
day and wound up all its business before
adjourning. Lengthy reports were read,
the annual election of officers held and
Charleston. S. C. selected. as the meeting
place, the next session to be held in Feb
ruary, 1901' '."'*.Â¦
The most important report presented at
the morning session yesterday was one on
legislation, which declared that the State
Railroad Commissioners have not the
power "of protective railway legislation,"
but that relief must come from Congress.
The report favors the Cullom bill, or some
measure that will have the same effect.
The document that the committee pre
sented shows clearly that there is a de-
Eire on the part of the Commissioners to
curb the power of the railroads. The re
port follows:
The Question must find its way to the floor
of Congress. There it has never yet been dis
posed of. Ultimately it will be, one way or
the other. The relief measure last proposed,
or the better understood so-styled Cullom bill,
was never considered outside â¢ of committee.'
Though adversely reported, it received subse
quently more favorable consideration when' It
â¢was allotted a place on the calendar. There
It rested, failing, as did a vast deal of other
important legislation, with the close of the
recent Congress. Â¦ ". .Â» Â»
Recommends Cullom Bill.
Tour committee would recommend' that this
bill, or some measure akin to it, be suggested
to the Fifty-seventh Congress, and Â¦- in that
connection begs leave to submit the following
resolution: .
Resolved. That the Congress be . earnestly
urged to the prompt enactment of appropriate
and essential legislation to forbid the charge
or receipt of unreasonable or greater compen
cation lor the transportation of passengers or
property over a chorter than a longer haul: to
provide, for the proper and more satisfactory
posting and publication of tariffs showing the
rates, fares, terminal charges, and joint rates
charged for interstate transportation, as well
â¢within our borders as beyond them, and to
more fully and specifiically declare against un
just discrimination, rebates and other devices
that would avoid the published rates and
schedules, and to penalize such offenses; to
eloihe the Interstate Commerce Commission
with power and authority to establish a na
tional freight classification and â¢ permit it to
alter and amend it when required, and to fix
also maximum, minimum and differential
charges, when its judgments need to be so
perfected. -
Resolved. That while urging action on the
several subjects upon which protective Ieglsla~
tion appears to be most required, the conven
tion would particularly direct attention to the
methods of enforcement, arrangement, expres
sion and incidentals substantially and fully
prescribed and set out specifically 1 and in de
tail in the measure submitted to the Senate
at the fii-rt session of the Fifty-sixth Con
gress, known to and accepted by the pubUc
as the Cullom bill.
Resolved, That copies* of this 'report and
resolution be transmitted to the president of
the Senate and the Speaker of the Houset of
ItepresentatlvftF. * *
JAMES "W. LATTA. Chairman.
CHARLES A. PROUTT.
FRANK M. BAKER.
JONATHAN ROSS,
FRAXKUN McNEIL^.
James W. Latta of Pennsylvania, chair
man of the committee, said the report,
was practically a unanimous one and he
licped that it would show that there was
a desire on the part of the committee to
pclnt out a way by which there could be
harmony between the commercial inter
ests and the -railways. The report was
adopted.
The report of the committee on safety
appliances was shelved. The report was
aimed at the Baltimore and Ohio South
western Railway and was as follows:
Imperfect Couplers.
Whereas, As an accident occurred to a
switchman on the 24th day of November, 1900.
on the Baltimore 'and Ohio Southwestern Rail
way, said road being engaged in interstate traf
fic, because one of its trainmen was required to
make a coupling between cars used in inter
ftate traffic, which were equipped with im
perfect and defective couplers ; said care
Fhould have been equipped with couplers
ooupling automatically, under the law; now,
therefore, bs It
Resolved by the Railway Commissioners of
the several States of the Union, in convention
Assembled in the city of San Francisco, That
they request the Interstate Commerce Commis
eion to exercise the power vested In It by law
to require the said Baltimore and Ohio South
western Railway to show cause, at a date and
time to be fixed by said commission, why it
â¢was haulins cars upon the line of its road
that require a switchman toico between and
eouple i-aid oars, in contravention of the Ian
on safety appliances; and be it further
Resolved. That on the fact being developed
during the investigation of said accident by
the Interstate Commerce Commission, that
raid Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Rail
way has a large number of cars . equipped
Â¦with couplers which make it necessary for its
switchmen to eo between the cars to couple
or uncouple the same, then' the . Interstate
Commerce Commission is, by virtue of this
resolution, requested to require said railway
to show cause why it has not equipped its
cars with such coupling devices as would
more nearly comply with the law.
Cicero J. Lindley of Illinois was re
elected president by acclamation.' The
otlÂ»r officers elected are: Vice president.
J. C. Wilborn of South Carolina; second
vice president. J. F. Chadbourne of
Maine: secretary, E. A. Moseley, and as
sistant secretary. J. Decker.
The excursion to Mount Tamalpais will
take place this morning. The Railroad
Commissioners and their wives will cross
the bay on the steamer San Pablo and
the other guests will take the regular
Scusalito steamer. After luncheon on the
summit of the mountain the party will
return to the city. In the evening the
Railroad Commissioners will be tendered
a. banquet at the Palace Hotel.
The convention adjourned last evening
but before doing so resolutions were
passed expressing thanks to the railroad
companies for the transportation and
train service that had been furnished.

PLANNING FOR A GREAT GATHERING
OF STATE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS
Programme Practically Completed -and Everything Ready for Meeting
in Santa Ana That It Is Hoped Will Be Second Orily to the Big
Convention -of EWorld's Endeavorers that Met Here Four Years Ago
THE SANr FRANCISCO CALL, SATUED^Y-i^UNE; 8, 190i;
The music of the convention has been
receiving special attention. In addition
to the usual large choir of trained voices
the orchestra'of the First Congregational
.Church of Los "Angeles, consisting- of
thirty members, will be in attendance at
all the sessions andat a grand sacred con
cert Sunday afternoon, June. 16, when it
Â¦ will musically illustrate ."The Incidents in
\ the Life of Christ." A. Horatio Cogswell
of Berkeley, who has been received so
tavorably by audiences in the college
town, appears a number of times on the
programme, as does also Miss Katharine
Stockton of New York, a prominent con
tralto'soloist.
THE Christian Endeavorers of Cal
ifornia are leaving: nothing that
will add to the interest or fame
of the convention^ to be held in
Santa Ana, beginning next. week',
undone or unplanned. It Is hoped almost
to make it compare with the immense
gat he ring of the world's Endeavorers that
toet In this city in 1897. . â¢ . -
Â¦ A complete programme for every day of
the convention has been prepared and all
the little details that mean' nothing' in
themselves, but are so essential In. achiev
ing the general result, have been taken in
charge by committees that have worked
14
The Endeavorers convenient to San
Francisco have chartered a special train,
which will go over the coast road by way
of Niles and San Jose, leaving the foot of
Market street at 8 o'clock Tuesday, June
12. Tickets for the round trip will be $16,
good . to â¢ return by way of Bakersfield if
preferred. George P. Lowell, the State
transportation manager, has been doing
most effective work during the past few
months in securing delegations from vari
ous districts, and from present indications
there will be four or five hundred in this
party. An organ and a supply of song
books specially prepared for the conven
tion will be taken along and a regular
programme for meetings Â¦ on the train. has
been prepared by E. C. LÂ»yon of Oakland.
All the. privileges of the . convention are
freely given to the public, - who are in
vited to come along and enjoy the trip.
Particulars in regard to the convention
will be -furnished at Christian Endeavor
headquarters, 429 Montgomery street.
as committees of that kind do not often
â¢work. â¢ The programme .has been the spe
cial care of JIM. "Warren of "Santa Bar
bara. '...'.'Â¦
Rev. Dr. Charles A. Dickinson of Sacra
mento will preach the convention sermon,
and Dr. Clark of the Willlston Church of
Portland, Me., will also address the body.
The AVilllston Church is where the first
Christian Endeavor Society was formed.
The general theme - of . the convention
will be "Christ Perfection," and it is
hoped the discussion of it will develop the
evangelistic' and missionary spirit which
has characterized the work, of many, of
the leading societies recently. Rev. Rich
ard TJader, a native of Sweden, who has
been, associated with 'Prince Bernarelotte,
the second son of King Oscar of Sweden,
and assisted at some of the large meet-
ings conducted by. Mr. Moody, will be
present, and. also Rev. S. E. TVishard,
D.D., of Utah.
