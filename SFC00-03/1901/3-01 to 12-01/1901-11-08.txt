Supervisors Consider Engineers' Re
port on Cost of Converting It
Into Electric Underground
Conduit Line.
ThÂ« Supervisors' Public Utilities Com
mittee met yesterday for the purpose of
considering the report of City Engineer
Grunsky and Associate Engineer Stut on
the cost of | converting the Geary street ,
road into an electric underground con
duit system with a view toward munici
pal ownership after the expiration of Its
franchise.
The report has been in the hands of
Mayor Phelan for ten days past, and in
transmitting it to the committee he said:
I believe, after consultation with the en
gineers, that the acquisition of the Geary street
railway Is a desirable project. It would cer
tainly be an object lesson in municipal owner
ship that might lead to other propositions in
the same direction. The City Engineer has ex
amined the matter thoroughly and found that
in Eastern cities the underground electric con
duit system is in successful operation. I there
fore approve of the recommendations of the
Board of Public Works in this connection.
The explanatory letter of the Board of
Works says: *
The proposed converted road and extensions
'Aggregate fifteen and six-tenths miles, and un
der the most expensive system of construction
and equipment, underground conduit for all
except one and three-fourths miles, is esti
mated to cost $3,032,000, or 5193,641 per mile
fIOO.OOO less per mile than the outstanding:
bonds and paid up stock of the existing road,
which is 5237,142 per mile for three and one
hs.lt miles.
The report says:
Urges Independent Road.
To make the Geary street road independent
of connections .by transfer with any other es
tablished system it should terminate at the
loot of Market street, not at the present road
terminal at Kearny street, and It would be
desirable to have connected with it a cross
town road. Particular attention is to be called
to the fact that the proposed cross-town road
Instead of turning west on Lombard street
can be carried from Gough street westerly out
Vallejo to Pierce and northerly alone Pierce
to Lombard to Chestnut, or to any of the
ether east and west streets nearer the bay
and thence westerly to the Presidio and even
Into the Presidio if so desired. The advantage
of a location on Vallejo street will be the
patronage to be expected in the immediate
future for a road located midway between
the cable roads already on Pacific street and
en Union street. There may be objection to
the placing of the road on Lombard street.
It has been projected along that street on ac
count of the direct approach to the main Pre
eldio entrance. It could as well have been
projected alone Chestnut street.
The route which has been made the basis of
the main cost estimate hereinafter referred to
m* "project A" is as follows:
"Along Market street from the ferry building
to Fell street, along Fell street westerly to
Stanyan; along Stanyan street to Fulton; along
the northerly margin of Golden Gate Park at
the south line of Fulton street to Tenth ave
nue; along Tenth avenue to Point Lobos ave
nue; along Point Lobos avenue and Geary
Street easterly to Market street and to a con
nection with the tracks from the ferry build
ing. "
Eoute of the Igew Cross-Town Line.
ThÂ« cross-town road would extend from the
Presidio to the Potrero, beginning at Lombard
and Lyon streets, thence along Lombard street
to Gough. along Gough street to Vallejo, along
Vallejo street to Franklin, along Franklin
street to Oak. along Oak street to Market, and
across Market street to Eleventh, along
Eleventh street to Division, along Division
street as Â¦widened to Potrero avenue, along Po
trero avenue to Fifteenth street, along Fif
teenth street to Eighth, along Eighth street to
Sixteenth, along Sixteenth street ' to Sixth,
along Sixth street to Tennessee, along Ten
nessee street to Twenty-second and along
Twenty-second street to a termination at Illi
nois street.
The cress-town road has been projected as
an overhead trolley electric system, with iron
poles from the Presidio to Potrero avenue and
Fifteenth street and wooden poles the rest of
the distance. A branch from the main conduit
system would be carried along Second street
from Market to Townsend and westerly on
Townsend street one block to Third. This
branch would also be a conduit road. # Ihe total
mileage of the proposed road would be: Geary
etreet converted roadbed, 3.33 miles; new con
duit road, 6.57 miles; overhead trolley road,
Â£.75 miles: total. 15.64 miles. â¢

REPRESENTATIVES OF BUYERS AND SELLERS OF THE MARKET-STREET COMPANY'S SYSTEM.
AFTER months of negotiation the
entire system of the Market
street Railway Company has
been sold to a Baltimore syndi
cate for the sum *of $26,000,000
cash, and this morning at 8 o'clock the
final papers of the transfer will be signei
by the contracting parties.
Last evening witnessed the close of the
negotiations between H. E. Huntingtcn
and 1.. W. Heliman, representing thorn
selves and other stockholders of the Mar
ket-street Company, and George R. Webb
of Baltimore, R. G. Hanford and Attor
ney General Tirey |* Ford of this city,
representing the Baltimore syndicate.
The transfer represents the most colos
sal cash purchase ever made In this coun
try, i Not a single share of new stock will
be given to the stockholders of the Mar
ket-street system for their holdings. Par
value in cash will be paid for each and
every share of stock of the system and
$26,000,000 will be placed in the hands of
San Francisco residents for reinvestment
in this city and locality.
The Baltimore syndicate will handle Its
purchase for business purposes only. It
is planned to expend at least $4,000,000 in
improvements and its aim will be to run
a model street system of transportation
and it will not dabble In politics. The
Baltimore syndicate is composed of cap
italists of world-wide renown and as tHey
hope to earn the good will of the people
pursued his Investigations in New York"
City, where there are seventy-three miles
of the conduit roads. He recommends
the conduit system on account of adjust
ability, freedom from street obstruction
and the abolishing of the moving- cable.
Against these he refers to the high first
cost, high power required, number of
sewer connections that must be installed
and unsightly appearance on account of
the large number of manholes. . The cli
matic conditions, however, are highly fa
vorable in this city for the system named.
Extension to the Ocean.
After a long discussion of the reports,
the committee agreed that the plans
should comprise an extension to the
ocean. The investigations had ceased at
a point two miles from the beach because
of the large quantities of sand in that
section. Replying to a question of Braun

the estimate of the cost of operation was
based on paying employes of the road 25
cents an hour. Braunhart called atten-

of San Francisco and will not mix up in
politics, one of the first acts of the new
owners of the street railway system will
be to tell William F. Herrin, the politicai
wire puller of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and also of the Market street sys
tem, to "go way back and sit down." In
other word.", Herrin will be told that the
syndicate will have no use for his ser
vices.
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford has
represented the syndicate in the negotia
tions of the purchase of the Market
street system.
As the syndicate will have nothing to
do with politics, It will have no use for
a lobbyist or a nineteenth member of the
Board of Supervisors and Jere Burke will
also be asked to step out.
Lynch and Vining to Go.
Those who are acquainted witti the
gentlemen who compose the Baltimore
syndicate know that the capitalists favor
the building of streetcar lines in the
streets and not across the "counters of
wayside inns." Superintendent of Con
htruction Lynch is not likely to be a
"holdover" with the new owners of the
Market-street system and General Man
ager E. P. Vining will also be called upon
to vacate. It was learned last evening

tion to the charter provision limiting the
hours of labor in any one day to eight,
which would insure a daily wage of $2.
"The raising of this question," said Ho
taling, "will certainly militate against
successful municipal ownership. Let us
run this scheme on business principles
and not look forward to the laboring
vote."
Braunhart argued that the enormous
profits of the street railway companies
would warrant the payment of $2 50 per
day. Grunsky said the cost of operation
would be $40,000 per annum more if $2 60
per day were paid employes. It was de
cided to leave the point to the people.
The committee decided to exclude Lom
bard street from the proposed route and
to recommend Vallejo and Chestnut
streets In Its stead. Also that the trolley
system be barred in the inhabited portion
of the city.

In accordance with the charter, the cora-
The Baltimore syndicate has been at
work in San Francisco for the past six
months. It is composed of the firm of
Alexander Brown & Sons of Baltimore,
Md., which was incorporated in 1799 and
which recently celebrated its one hun
dredth anniversary. The parent house in
Baltimore has branches in New York,
London and Philadelphia and is represent
ed in all financial circles in this country
and Europe, In New York it established
the firm of Brown Bros. & Co, while in
London its interests are looked after by
Brown, Shipley & Co. The correspondent
for the syndicate in San Francisco is the
Bank of California.
The Baltimore syndicate has worked in
a quiet and business-like manner to secure
the street railroad systems of this city.
It is no novice in that line. It consoli
dated and financed the systems of St.
Louis, Plttsburg ,nd Baltimore, with an
aggregate capital of $200,000,000. <
George R. Webb of Baltimore has rep
resented the syndicate in its deal with the
Market-street company and also with the
Sutter-street company and the owners of
the San Mateo electric line. Webb is the
president of the United Railway and Elec
tric Company of Baltimore.
Beginning of a Big Deal.
Early in the year R. G. Hanford, the
mining operator of San Francisco, under
took the proposal to find a purchaser for
the San Mateo electric line. The Balti
mittee then recommended the adoption of
the following resolution:
Whereas, It is the Intention of the Board of
Supervisors to enter into negotiations for the
permanent acquisition by the city and county,
by original construction, condemnation or pur
chase of street railroads and to formulate and
submit to the electors of the city and county,
at a special election, a proposition for thÂ«
permanent acquisition and ownership thereof;
therefore be it â¢
Resolved. That in conformity with the pro
visions of the charter the Geary Street Railway
Company, the Market Street Railway Company,
California Street Railway Company. Presidio
and Ferries Railroad Company, the San Fran
cisco and San Mateo Railway Company, the
Butter Street Railway Company, and all other
persons, firms or corporations possessing street
railroads in the city and county, or franchises
for the operation of street railroads therein,
are hereby solicited to offer for sale to the
city and county of San Francisco on or before
Monday, November 25, 1901, their said street
railroads and the franchises for operating the
same.
more syndicate was the purchaser, and
then Hanford carried through the deal
by which the Sutter-street line also passe-l
into their hands.
So successful were Hanford and Attor
ney. General Ford in their dealings with
Webb that the question of the acquisi
tion of the Market street system was then
taken up by the gentlemen.
The San Mateo line changed hands In
May last, and it was announced at that
time that the new owners would ulti
mately extend the road to San Jose. In
June last the Sutter street line passed
into possession of the Baltimore syndi
cate. R. F. Morrow, the president of the
Sutter street line, had previously acquired
the Sutro electric line from Central ave
nue to the Cliff House.
Since that time the negotiations for the
purchase of the Market-street system
have been constantly carried on. I. W.
Heliman and H. E. Huntington repre
sented the stockholders In the system,
and their desire was that all stockholders
should be treated on a basis of equality.
It was known, since the negotiations had
commenced, that two-thirds of the stock
could be purchased at par from large
holders and this would have left a few
hundred small stockholders without the
customary financial safeguards. The syn
dicate desired to purchase the entire stock
and details delayed the negotiations for
a time. Webb made frequent trips be
Chairman Reed stated that he did not
think any of the companies would com
ply. If they do the lowest bid will be
voted on together with the municipal own
ership of the Geary street road and its
proposed extension. The questions will be
submitted to the people immediately on
the expiration of the franchise, which will
be next year.
QUEER RULING BY THE
TREASURY DEPARTMENT
Customs Collector Stratton received in
structions yesterday from the Secretary
of the Treasury to land seven Chinese
laborers returning to this country who
had been held up by the Collector be
cause they had remained away from the
United States for a period greater than
one year without having shown a satis
factory certificate from the Chinese con
sular agent at this port that they had
overstayed their time because of sickness
or other unavoidable circumstance. Tha
tween Baltimore, New York and San ;
Francisco and came back to this city a
few days ago. Consultations were held
with the representatives of the stock
holders and finally an agreement was
reached last evening.
Stock to Be Bought at Par.
The plan of transfer adopted will be the
same as that followed when the Valley
Road was made over to the Santa Fe
system. All the stock has been pooled
and sold at par, the smaller stockholders
thus receiving equal treatment with the
larger ones.
The Baltimore syndicate proposes to
give the people of San Francisco a per
fect system of street railway transport
ation. It is planned to spend in the near
future $4,060,000 in improvements and If
the people of this city so desire, it will !
turn the Sutter street line int" an electric I
road, thus giving a rapid service from j
the ferry to the Cliff House and abolish- j
ing the antiquated horse car line that
now runs from the ferry to the end of the
Sutter street cable line at Market and ;
Sansome street.
Another reform that will be appreciated '
will be a general transfer system. In i
other words, wherever one line of the I
Market street system crosses another line
a transfer will be issued in either direc
tion.
New and commodious car 3 are to be
placed on the Market street lines and
more rapid and frequent service insti
tuted where needed.
This morning, when the final papers of
transfer are signed, will mark the be
ginning of an era of improvement in the
street railroad facilities of San Francisco.
The papers will be signed at 8 a. m. and
two hours later George R. Webb will start
for the East to report to the members
of the syndicate he represents the con
summation of the deal.
Values of Street Car Systems.
According to the statistics of the City
and County Assessor, made two years ago.
the following was given at that time as
the value of the Market street system
and other, street car companies in this
city:

Change Will Bo Hailed With Joy.
The people of San Francisco will wel
come the change in the management of
the Market-street railway system, espe
cially if the new owners fully carry out
its promises to keep to business and not
dabble in politics. The retirement of
Herrin, Lynch, Burke and Vlning will be
hailed with joy by thousands who have
Euffered from their influence in the past. Â¦
I action of the Secretary of the Treasury
I was based upon a petition by Ho Vow,
I Chinese Consul General.
Some months ago the Treasury Depart
ment, for some inscrutable reason, ruled
that whenever a Chinese laborer who had
remained away from the United States
longer than the statutory period applied
for readmission he should present a cer
tificate from the Chinese consular repre
sentative at the returning port in tho
United States to the effect that said con
sular ageht believed, or "was satisfied,''
that the applicant had been detained by
sickness or other unavoidable cause. This
ruling was the cause of much merriment,
because clairvoyance was not generally
supposed to be part of the mental equip
ment of Chinese Consuls. The seven ap
plicants were of the same mind also, for
they procured certificates from the United
States Consul at the Chinese port.
Collector Stratton allowed the men to
be landed Immediately upon the receipt
of the Instructions from the Secretary of
the Treasury,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.

LEAVENWORTH, Kan., Nov. 7.â On*
man was killed, three others dangerously
wounded and twenty-six desperate con
victs are at large as the result of a
mutiny late this afternoon at the site
of the new United States prison, two
miles southeast of here, where 400 pris
oners from the Federal prison, in charge
of thirty armed guards, were at work.
When the trouble began the rebellious
prisoners had only two revolvers. Thess
revolvers had been secreted in one of tha
walls of the building by some unknown
person. There are two walls partly com
pleted and the rest of the site of tha
building is surrounded by a high woodea
stockade.
Gus Parker, of Ardmore. I. T. . one of
the ringleaders of the mutiny, under pre
tense of a necessity, walked to the cor
ner of the stockade, where the revolver*
were concealed, and under cover of some
weeds secured them without being de
tected. He returned to the gang and
passed one of the revolvers to Frank
Thompson, a negro from South McAles
ter, I. T., who secreted it about his per
1 son.
Guards Fight Gamely.
When F. E. Hinris, superintendent of
: construction, and three unarmed guarda,
prepared to round up the men at the end
of the day's work the two armed con
| victs covered them with the revolvers
| and, encouraged by the other mutinous
I convicts, forced the men to walk before
them toward the northwest corner of the
I stockade, where they expected to make a
rush through an opening.
The outside of the stockade was guard
ed by armed men, and when the convicts
appeared at the opening they were met
by C. E. Burrows, a guard, who fought
them back, but received two shots in the
neck. The convicts then rushed over to
the south wall to another opening and
were met by Arthur Tretford, an arm^d
guard, who is^ in charge of all the con
victs. Trelfnrd resisted the convicts and
was phot twice, but not dangerously
wounded. Defeated in their attempt ta
escape at this point, the men rushed to
the guard house, a temporary frame
structure, where the arms are kept. The
guards from the outside rushed in Â«t
this point and dfove the convicts away
from the guard house.
One of the Convicts Killed.
J. P. Waldrup, a guard, shot and killed
Ford Quinn. from Ryan, I. T. The pris
oners then madp a grand rush for tho
main entrance, and twenty-six of them
succeeded in escaping. Most of the
escaped men are from the Indian Terri
! tory. Closely followed by the guard tho
men ran to a nearby forest and succeeded
in evaaing their pursuers.
The men went in the direction of
i Easton, Kan., and it is reported hero
I that they have held up many farmers,
i taking horsea and clothes en route.
Major R. W. McCloughry, warden of

Hinds to go with them and he was not
allowed to return until they had gone aU

the fugitives, who has but fifteen months
more to serve, deserted the band a few
' moments after Superintendent Hinds w

The two men reached here almost at

cided that they would form themsel
into several small parties, so that stoma

them to reach the rough country south

Soldiers Join Pursuit.
Twenty-four members of the Fourth
Cavalry hastened to the scene of the
trouble, but when they arrived the con
victs had escaped and the soldiers could
not participate in the chase without or

Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING. Nov. 7.â The miscalcula
tions of a fiend who had arranged a time
bomb beneath a building dry as tinder
is all that has saved the business portion
of the town of Anderson, ten miles soutn
of Redding, from being reduced to ashes.
â¢\ pitmaiure explosion resulted in a
ropne being averted and in the re
vealing ot a mat-nine set to work unlim
ited uestruetion.
This attempt to burn the business sec
1 the town is noi the ilrst of its
kind, and if the perpetrators can be cauglu
they aiL- liable to summary vengeance.
The crime was commuted Monday night,
though it did nri become genera. iy known
Â¦until to-day. The tiretrap was laid be
neath the irame building at the corner of
a block in the center of the town occupied
by Frank Smith as a saloon. All the
buildings cf the block but one are frame
md Â¦ b other. The next block,
largely frame, is across a narrow street,
and a ttre well started would sweep the
entire Lusiness quarter.
Late Monday night a half-dozen me i
detainee the barkeeper in Smith's saloon.
Sudden. y smoke began to rise througn
the floor and a muffled explosion followed.
Boards raised in the floor as if the nails
had been drawn and the room was filled
with filming wads of excelsior. Buckets
iter from a trough in front quickly
put out the lire.
A man climbed down under the low
flooring and found the unburned section
t>! a fuse, pieces of the bomb which had
exploded and a quantity of excelsior and
paper, which smelled of coal oil.
The arrangen.ents to fire the building
were complete. The fuse had apparently
been crossed or mistimed and the explo
sion had occurred prematurely, the per
petrator undoubtedly intending it should
occur later, when the place would be
without occupants. If the scheme had
worked as planned a conflagration must
have occurred, and nothing would have
remained to show how it happened. Th<*
bomb was cleverly manufactured with a
tin can. powder, rags and paper.
The people of Anderson are more than
ever determined to catch the man who
planned this destruction, for he has op
crated in the town before and apparently
lives there. Merchants have found queer
things indicating fire machines in hidden
corners about â¢â¢heir stores. At least two
buildings have burned mysteriously, ani
a home-made bomb was kicked from the
porch of a house occupied by a Chiness
Â¦ efore it exploded.

A Sour Stomach
Is Often the Real Cause of a
Sour Temper.
That the condition of the digestive or-
pans has a marked effect upon the charac-
ter or disposition is a truism as old as
the hills. Old Ben Johnson wisely said,
V* r
"the pleasure of living depends upon the
liver," and it is 'a fact which none may
dispute that a sunny disposition more
often results from a healthy digestion
than from any other cause.
Acid dyspepsia, commonly called sour
stomach or heartburn, is caused by slow
digestion of food; instead of being prompt-
ly digested and converted into blood, bone
and muscle. it lies in the stomach for
hours, fermenting and decaying, creating
gases which cause pressure on the lungs
and heart, short breath and general dis-
comfort and irritation.
Such half digested food Is Indeed poor
nourishment for the body, brain and
nerves and the result Is shown in irritable
.tempers, unaccountable headaches and
that depressing condition usually called
the "blues." But how quickly all these
disappear when appetite and digestion are
restored.
Laxative medicines "only Irritate the al-
ready irritated stomach and "bowels and
have no effect upon actual digestion of
food.
The sensible course to follow is to make
Â¦use "i simple natural digestives like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after meals
jntil the stomach has a chance to recup-
. te.
The natural digestives which every heal-
:hy stomach contains are peptones dias-
iase and Hydrochloric and lactic acids
- and when any of them are lacking the
uouble begins. The reason Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are so valuable and 6UC-
ossful In curing stomach troubles is be-
cause they contain, in a pleasant concen-
uated tablet, form, all these absolutely
- necessary essentials for perfect digestion
Â«md assimilation of food. 6 n
Henry Kirkpatrlck of Lawrence, Mass
tiays: "Men and women whose occupation
precludes an active out door life should
make it a daily practice to use Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after meals. I have
done sc myself and I know positively that
] owe my present health and vigor to
their daily use. .
"From the time I was 22, when I gradu-
ated from school with broken health from
work, until I was 34, I scarcely knew
what It was to be free from stomach
weakness. I had no appetite whatever for
breakfast and very little for any other
raeal.
"I had acidity and heartburn nearly
every day and sometimes was alarmed by
i-regularityi -regularity and palpitation of the heart,
tut all this gradually, disappeared after I
began using Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets
and I can eat my meals with relish and
a action which I had not known since
I was a growing boy." ,
The 6uces!= and popularity of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets is enormous, but it is
â¢ deserved, and every druggist in the United
States, Canada and Great Britain has a
good word for this meritorious prepara-
tion. Â¦HSGGSKS

IU" TH X WINTERS CASE
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 7.â J. Ross Win
ters is on trial to-day In the Superior
Court charged with the^ murder of his
young wife. The evidence against Win
ters Is circumstantial and of an unusual
character.
Early on tne morning of May 11 Win
ters and his wife started out with their
guns in a light buggy to shoot doves In
the vicinity of Pasadena. About two
hours later Winters came driving home

Wife on the seat beside him. Driving to
a neighbor's house he let the body fall
and called for help. The friends who
rushed out of the house found the woman
dead from a gunshot wound in the back
Winters' story of the accident was that
his wife's gun had been accidentally dis
charged while she was climbing through
a fence. The fact that the young man
immediately applied for insurance taken
out by his wife and that his stories of
the affair were conflicting led to his
subsequent arrest on the charge of mur

Gilroy Farmer Writes
to the State Prison
Directors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Nov. 7.-The efforts of
the State Prison Directors to ascertain
what persons were concerned in a scheme
to corner the jute bag output of the mills
at San Quentln are in no degree being
relaxed. The latest development in the
investigation is extremely interesting and
the directors are not yet certain Just how
to view it.
This "development" is a letter, the con
tents of which rather startled the board.
At a meeting held in San Francisco last
evening Director James H. Wilkins was
handed the letter by the secretary. This
is the text of It:
"GILROY, Nov. 6, 1301.â T0 Mr. J. H.
Wilkinsâ Dear Sir: I wish to state in
connection with the fraud of San Quentin
grain sacks that last April or May I wrote
to Warden Agulrre respecting sacks and
was informed that my order could not
be filled until late in September. Shortly
afterward I received a circular letter
from Anspacher Bros, quoting me San
Quentln sacks. I could have bought them
myself from the prison authorities. It
would have saved me several much-need
ed dollars. If necessary I am. willing to
make affidavits to the above statements.
"W. B. FRANKLIN."
At the September meeting of the di
rectors at San Quentin Anspacher Bros.,
acting as agents for a number of people,
presented a large order for jute bags. It
was the number and size of these orders
that first made the prison officials sus
picious that all who made affidavits were
not farmers.
Under the law the intention is to. give
the farmers of the State the exclusive
opportunity of buying their grain bags
directly from the mill, thus saving them
the middlemen's profits. In order to get
bags from the prison the farmer was
compelled to make an affidavit stating
that he wanted the bags for his own use.
His affidavit and order were then filed and
in due time he received the necessary
sacks at a moderate cost.
Several weeks ago a plot was uncovered
whereby a number of firms sought to cor
ner the output of the Jute mill. It was
known that false affidavits had been used
and that prison-made bags were sold to
farmers In San Francisco for over 2 cents
In advance of the selling price at San
Quentin. The services of all the district
attorneys in the grain-producing counties
of the State were enlisted by the direct
ors. Detectives were employed to gather
evidence. No stone has been left un
turned. That Investigation is still pro
gressing and the next meeting of the di
rectors promises to develop some sensa
tional features.
Simon Anspacher of the firm of An
spacher Bros., hay and grain dealers at
214 Pine street, said last night that he is
not a dealer in jute bags and that he
knows of nothing which could furnish a
basis for the statements made by Frank
lin in his letter to Director Wilkins.
Wheelman Killed in Collision.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 7.â Paul F. Kent,
a 15-year-old boy, was killed In a bicycle
collision at Fifteenth and Main streets to
night. Kent was riding fast and dashed
headlong into another wheelman going in
the opposite direction. The boy was killed
while the other rider was bruised, but not
seriously injured.

STAINS TELL
OF A TRAGEDY
Bloody Garments ot
Chief Meredith
in " Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. 7.â The bullet pierced
and blood stained garments worn by Wil
liam L. Meredith, formerly Chief of Se
attle's police, when he was shot to death
by John W. Considlne June 25, were
placed in evidence to-day in the trial of
Considine for murder.
The presentation of the garments In
court came near the close of the session
and as a climax to a day devoted to evi
dence for the prosecution. The courtroom
was crowded and the scene, white devoid
of striking incident, waa very Impressive.
The undertaker's employe who had dis
robed the body of Meredith displayed the
garments one by one to the court and
jury with a few words of explanation.
Seated by their counsel. John Considlne
and his brother Tom, who is under the
same charge and will be tried later, look
ed fixedly at the witness. The defense
made no examination and offered no ob
jection to the introduction of the exhibits.
The testimony of the day related to
threats said to have been made by John
Considine agaiftst Meredith prior to the
shooting. One witness told of being pass
ed on the street an hour or so before
the shooting by John, and a man to the
witness unknown. The witness said he
heard the stranger say:
"Now, John, don't make any bull or
mistake about it." To which Considine
replied, "I won't."
Other evidence went to the support of
the theory which the prosecution is seek
ing to establish in proof that six shots
were fired in the melee which ended in
Meredith's death. The prosecution holds
that Tom Considlne fired the first shot at
Meredith, which went wild, and not until
then did Meredith discharge his shotgun
at John. They also Beck to establish that
Meredith was beaten to insensibility and
perhaps to death by Tom and was help
less and unconscious when the fatal shots
were fired by John.
The State announced that Its case would
be closed by to-morrow evening. As some
of the strongest witnesses at the jrre
liminary hearing have been reserved, the
testimony is expected to be highly sensa
tional and important. Eighty-five wit
nesses have been summoned by the de
fense and It will be at least a week, per
haps *en days, before the case Is ready
for the consideration of the Jury.

Battle.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 7.â Just aft
er leaving Colton last night the Southern
Pacific local train that runs between Riv
erside and San Bernardino was boardel
by eleven tramps, who when requested
by Conductor Evans to pay their fare in
formed the conductor that they were run
ning the train and that they would not
pay fare.
The conductor Insisted on the payment
and the men ordered him off the train.
Evans called for assistance from the pas
sengers and the other trainmen, and then
commenced a bloody fight. The intruders
were armed with clubs and knives and
they used them with ouch effect that
Brakeman George Jones was seriously
injured and Conductor Evans was badly
beaten. Jones was cut in the side and
his right arm waa slashed. Several of
their assailants were injured, though how
seriously cannot be learned.
The men were finally ejected from the
train and a quick run was made to Riv
erside, where the matter was reported to
the officers. Word of the attack was sent
back to Cotton, and the officers are scour Â¦
ing the country to find tie men. A good
description of the man who stabbei
Brakeman Jones- has been furnished th-s
officers and they have strong hopes of
capturing him.
Southern California Is overrun with
tramps at the present time, and many
outrages nave been committed during the
past two weeks. In every city in tnia
part of the State extra policemen have
been appointed.
pense has been intense, but, fortunately,
there has been no bloodshed. A Southern
Pacific force is now engaged in construct

all night and maintained a double-bar
reled shotgun guard on the ground. Divi
sion Engineer Ott of the El Paso an-Â»

his defalcation was discovered. He is
now at his home awaiting the action of
the bonding companies. His erfbezzle
ment is confessed in the following letter
to Supreme Commander D. P. Markey:
Confession of Theft.
D. P. Maricey, Supreme Commander Knights
of the Maccabeesâ Dear Sir: It is with a feel
ing of distress and shame that I tender here
with my resignation as supreme finance keeper
of the order of which you are the head. And
this step Is taken with a bitter realization that
I am no loneer worthy of the companionship
of my fellow officers. I have held th ; posi
tion since the order was founded, have during
most of that time been officially associated
with the present supreme officers and
never until now did 1 in any way betray my
trust. I was engaged in a legitimate business
venture in which I had made a large invest
ment and found myself in a position where
further money was necessary to save myself
from bankruptcy and ruin. There was ap
parently no chance for loss. I then betrayed
my trust and used the funds of the order, at
the time believing there was no question of
my ability to replace them within a short
time. The amount I used was $57,00u. I have
no hope of being able to repay this amount.
I know the order is protected from loss by
the surety bond of nearly twice the amount
In a perfectly responsible company, but this
docs not lessen my mental sufferine nor re
lieve me from the disgrace of having betrayed
the confidence reposed in me. Nothing that
can occur can Increase the tortures which I
have suffered and am still suffering. I can
only await such action as may be taken and
abide by the consequences. Xo punishment can
be greater and no suffering so intense as that
resulting from the loss of respect and esteem
of the membership of the order and the suffer
ing necessarily caused to my family.
CHARLES B. THOMPSON.
Discovery of Shortage.
The first intimation of the shortage
came last Tuesday afternoon, when Su
preme Commander Markey and Supreme
Record Keeper George J. Slgele were
checking over the finance keeper's books.
Aii error was found and they called
Thompson's attention to it. He said he
would take the books and papers home
with him that night and look It up. Wed
nesday morning he went to Markey's of
fice and confessed that his accounts were
short $57,000. He then and there signed a
written confession of the embezzlement.
An examination of the books followed
and the shortage was disclosed. Supreme
Commander Markey this afternoon gave
out the following in regard to it:
Charles B. Thompson has been supreme
finance keeuer of the supreme treasury since
September. 1883. and cash handled and dis
bursed during that time amounts to more than
$15,000,000, and until this time there has never
been a suspicion against his integrity. The
Supreme Court keeps on deposit large amounts
of money In leading banks in several commer
! cial centers on which warrants are drawn for
the aayment of death claims, but all collec
! tions are made through the Commercial Bank
j of Port Huron, and it is a part of the duties
of the supreme finance keeper to transfer from
time to time from the Commercial Bank to
these other depositories money for the pur
pose of keeping the account good at such
banks, and the money that was used in thie
case by Mr. Thompson was on a draft trans
ferring from the Commercial Bank to th*
First National Bank of New York. The short
age Is JET, OOO, but no loss will be incurred by
the Supreme Court, as every financial offi
cial of the organization, including Mr. Thomp
son, i= bonded in surety companies, and the
bond held by the order as security for Mr.
Thompson's integrity is very much greater
than the shortage. But the fact that no pe
cuniary loss Is sustained does not relieve from
regret the membership of the association who
have been able to say that no officer has ap
propriated a sinirle dollar entrusted to his
care. The bond company has been notified of
the defalcation and the Supreme Court wil!
look to them to make good the amount. Pend
ing a settlement with the bond company, there
will be no delay in the payment of death
claim?, as the Supreme Court has on deposit
throughout the United States a little more
than half a million dollars, besides having
bonds amounting to more than $1,120,000.
Expects to Be Prosecuted.
The companies on Thompson's bond
were notified of the shortage to-day, and
representatives of each are now on their
way to Port Huron. Thompson is not un
der arrest, but pays he expects to be ar
rested and prosecuted and is prepared to
pay the penalty of his breach of trust.
The heavy lo?s= pustain^d by the Thomp
son Towing and Wrecking Company of
this city, of which Thompson is a member,
on the steamer Harlem, which they
raised from the bottom of Lake Superior,
is responsible for the defalcation. Thomp
son said this evening that he used the
funds of the order in this enterprise,
whirh proved vpry unprofitable, as tht?
expense of raising and refitting the craft
was= BO srrpat that Phe had to be s=old at

PRESIDENT CASTRO ACCEPTS THE GOOD OFFICES
OF CHILE TO END THE TROUBLE WITH COLOMBIA
Venezuela's Chief Executive, However, Proposes Terms That
Will Not Be Acceptable to His Neighbor.
PORT OF SPAIN, Nov. 7. â President Castro has accepted the good offices of Chile to end the trouble
between Venezuela and Colombia. This action by President Castrc after having refus:d the proffered
good offices of the United States is not considered politic. It is learned from a reliable source that cer
tain terms mentioned by President Castro will not be acceptable tc Colombia.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7.â The last advices received from the Isthmus of Panama, dating back
about a week, are to the effect that everything was quiet in the neighborhood of Panama and Colon. The
insurrectionists were reported to have disappeared completely from the vicinity of Panama. A preceding
report stated that an outbreak he.d resulted in the dispersal of the rebels.

CONGO NATIVES
PUT TO DEATH
Hundreds of Them Killed
by Expeditions Sent
After Rubber.
LONDON, Nov. 7.â Edgar Canisus, an
American, who recently retired from the
employ of the Congo Free State, confirms
the terrible stories told about the con
dition of the natives, especially in the
portions termed the State domain, where
strangers are seldom admitted.
Canisus, who accompanied Major Lo
thair, commander of the Belgian troops
in the Congo, on his earlier expedition
after rubber, says 900 natives were killed
in six weeks, during that expedition, while
a smaller expedition, commanded by a
Belgian lieutenant, killed 300 natives in
three weeks. The district is practically
under martial law, on the strength of
which such endless barbarities are com
mitted that the natives are absolutely
terror-stricken. Canisus further declares
that the so-called punitive expeditions are
in reality rubber-squeezing raids, conduct
ed with such iniquitous methods that the
natives are in a constant state of revolt.
While the conditions are somewhat im
proved in the territories worked by the
concession companies, the lot of the na
tives in the State domain, Canisus says,
is far worse than before the advent of
the whites. The natives are practically
forced to work rubber at the muzzles of
rifles, receiving 2 cents per pound for
what is sold at 75 cents at Antwerp.
Thousands of natives have fled to the
bush and live like wild animals. Along
the jungle paths the bodies of those who
have died of starvation are frequent
sights.
Canisus, who conies from. Illinois, was
recently a resident of Washington.

toward the purchase of an interest in
the business of Seymour, Johnson & Co.
Colonel Ammon was arraigned and is
held in the custody of his counsel.

LIFE DEPENDS
UPON SECRECY
Publicity Is Spoiling All
Plans to Rescue
Miss Stone.
SOFIA, Nov. 7.â Consul General Dickin
son of Constantinople is greatly cha
gTined because the fact that he had re
ceived a letter from Miss Ellen M. Stone
leaked out. He says it is calculated to
seriously affect if not completely undo
the progress already attained. On two
previous occasions negotiations with the
brigands who abducted the American mis
sionary were abruptly broken off by the
former owing to the premature disclosure
of secrets, which the bandits regarded as
being a breach of the understanding with
them.
Dickinson informed a Call correspondent
to-day that it is absolutely indispensable
if Miss Stone is ever to be released that
the course of the negotiations is to be
kept inviolably secret. It is hopeless to
expect the brigands to place confidence in
the negotiators when they find that infor
mation which they regard as secret ia
constantly leaking out.
Dickinson dispatched a messenger yes
terday With a reply to the brigands' prop
csition as formulated in Miss Stone's let
ter. It is understood that an agreement
as to the amount of the ransom has been
virtually established. The settlement as
to the manner and place of payment and
the surrender of the captive presents the
most difficulty, but an entente is expect
ed soon. The' brigands are not wiling to
cross the iine into Turkey to obtain the
money, while the Bulgarian Government
would oppose releasing Miss Stone on Bul
garian soil.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Nov. 7.-No prog
ress was reported to-day in connection
with the rescue of Miss Stone. On the
contrary, it appears that the negotiations
have been temporarily suspended from
the Bulgarian side. An effort will be made
to resume thÂ£m through Salonika. Eddy,
secretary of the United States legation, is
having frequent interviews with Sir
Nicholas O'Connor, the British Embas-'
sador, with a view to a resumption, and
proposes to go to Thorapia for a few
days in order to be in close touch with
the Embassador.
RAILROAD HANDS
OUT ON STRIKE
Denver and Rio Grande
Switchmen Desert
the Yards.
DENVER, Nov. 7.â The switchmen on
the Denver and Rio Grande Railway to
day declared a general strike and the
men went out at Denver, Pueblo, Gun
nison and some other points on the sys
tem. It Is understood that the rest will
go out to-morrow. The question involved
is said to be the recognition of the
Switchmen's Union of North America.
The company claims that its agreement
with the Brotherhood of Railway Train
men covers the yard service and declines
to recognize the other organization.
In Denver the men now out number
thirty-one, in Pueblo twenty, and a lesser
number at other points. W. G. Lee of
Cleveland, first vice grand master of the
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, is now
in Pueblo in conference' with the striking
switchmen. So far the business of thfl
railway has been only delayed, as the
other trainmen have done the work of the
strikers.
Frank T. Hawley of Buffalo, N. T.,
grand master of the Switchmen's Union
of America, has been here since the mid
dle of October making efforts to settle
the troubles between the switchmen and
the company. It was only decided this
morning that a strike should be declared
and at midnight Hawley stated that he
Jiad received telegrams to the effect that
235 men are already out, comprising all
the switchmen on the system. They are
employed at the following points: Den
ver, Pueblo, Salida, Durango, Alamosa,
Crested Butte, urand Junction, Gleen
wood Springs, Aspen, Leadville and Gun
nison.
Hawley stated that the switchmen did
not expect assistance from the other
trainmen's organizations. The strikers
will demand an increase of wages before
they will return to work.
General Manager Herbert of the Den
ver and Rio Grande stated to-night, in an
interview that the strike of the switch
men would not Interfere with the com
pany's business and lhat no man involved
in this strike will be re-employed.

SOCIETY TO TURN OUT FOR DOCTOR'S DAUGHTERS'
DOLL SHOW, WHICH IS TO OPEN THIS MORNING
METSON LEADS
HIS DETECTIVES
Tells Story of Work Per
formed by Sleuths
Up in Nome.
Noyes' Attorneys Enjoy a
Merry Time Making
Objections.
W. H. Metson furnished a sensation late
yesterday afternoon during the Nome con
tempt proceedings. The attorneys for Re
spondent Arthur H. Noyes were responsi
ble for It.
V Metson went to Nome as an attorney
representing big mining Interests. When
he landed he found his clients blocked at
every Instance and in order to cut through
the Ice of legal â¢ obstructions he employed
& detective force, directed its movements
and saw . that his . enemies were "hoist
with their own. petard."
Some of the scandal about McKenzie,
Judge Noyes and all the co-conspirators
as alleged has been printed. W. T. Hume
toW the bulk of the sensational side of
the case during the first two days of the
bearing. That was three .weeks ago, since
"which time there has been much reitera
tion and little that was startling.
Metson was afforded the opportunity
yesterday afternoon, and he told what he
knew of the cases at. bar. The respond
ent's attorneys objected, but, as the testi
mony Is taken before a commissioner, they
found little satisfaction.
Was Captain of Detectives.
The direct examination of Metson, con
ducted by Judge McLaughlln, elicited the
fact that he had employed four detectives
to sift the McKenzie-Noyes, combination.
By name they were Carson, Crowley,
Brown and Herrin. What they learned
was reported to Mr. Metson. He detailed
them to assignments of duty and received
their reports as one accustomed to the
work.
McLe-ughlin was kept busy building up
Met eon's reputation, as a leader of detec
tive*. After bringing to light the special
and private system of espionage he gave
his attention to the case of Carson.
"Carson then was acting as a sort of
spy for the Government 1" asked Mc
i.-a.ug'hlln.
"Yes. sir," replied Metson.
"When did you first employ Carson?"
"About the latter part of Augustâbe
fore Frost employed him," answered the
witness.
. , . More Noyes Disclosures.
McLaughlln then diverted the examin
ation to the spying on Judge Noyes. He
asked :Â» "Did you assign to any of the
detectives the duty of spying on Judge
Noj-es?"
Metson responded: "I did not, but some
of them out of their own volition spied
on Judge Noyes."
Crowley it was who brought the inter
esting information to Metson. Since that
time Crowley died. When told of the
death of Crowley Judge McLaughlln said:
"It were better he had died before."
"Not so," said Metson. a "He was a good
man and what he found out about Judge
Noyes would make all the evidence slum
ber for all time."
Then McLaughlln tried to force from
Metson an admission of regret that he
employed spies to work on the case, but
all he got for an answer was a declar
ation from the witness that he was glad
of the chance to get at the bottom of the
"McKenzie-Noyes-Frost- Wheeler- Stevens
alliance."
The cross-examination was what Met
son and Pillsbury both reveled in. Met
son told of his deep-seated antipathy for
C. A. S. Frost, recited his suspicions that
be afterward found to be verified and
rounded out the general tale with specific
Instances of Judge Noyes' iniquitous ju
dicial procedure, all founded on the de
tective information furnished him. Mc-
Kenzle was exposed as a real party in
the Anvil claim cases. The "Soapy" Smith
crowd of jury stuffers, fresh from Skag
uay, and the rest of the bad men of
Nome were passed upon by Metson. He
finished them all up with a statement
that every rich claim would have been
tied up by the machine if matters had
not been exposed.
Crowley Heard Much.
Crowley told Metson in one of the In
terviews that he overheard Noyes say
that bo far as the gold dust was con
cerned he would not obey the writs, an<l
that it was talked over between McKer.
zie and Noyes about sending the gold dust
outside to keep it without the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court of Appeals.
To all of this the attorneys fairly
rained objections, but the matter went
into the record just the same. Thâ¬ cross-
Questioning closed with an attempt of the
amicus curiae to find what had become
of $25,000 gold belonging to McKenzie
which came out on the Roanoke.
In the morning M. J. Cochran took the
stand, and was soon after succeeded by
Thomas Jacobs, a claim owner on Anvil
Creek. Jacobs testified as to the manner
of staking and the operations of the Lane
crowd. The object of the respondents in
putting Jacobs on the stand was to show
that military Supplies and reindeer were
used by them, and that they fought gov
ernmental organization and the carrying
out of the mining laws. It is the charge
of the respondents' attorneys that a con
spiracy existed among the Lane people
against Judge Korea. . . .
Judge McLaughlln said last night that
he is not sure now whether he will put
Judge Noyes on the stand.

To-Day.
Sawdust Lady to

Home.
THE all-important day Is here.
At 11 o'clock this morning the
doors of Native Sons' Hall will
swing wide open, and In the big
hall, with Its rows of "boxes,"
and In the many adjoining
rooms handsome D. D's. will be In at
tendance to receive a generous public, and
the "doll show" will be on.
After weeks of careful preparations,
everything is in readiness for the big
show.
Not one detail has been neglected, and
one need not pose as a prophet to predict
a Buccess for the noble Doctor's Daugh
ters.
The ladies having the affair in charge
a- a just a bit nervous. This year's "doll
show" has gTown to such tremendous pro
portions that It Is altogether natural that
the Daughters should feel the responsibil
ity. But they have labored so long and
so well that they need have no appre
hension as to the result.
I predict that the hall to-night will have
that gay and brilliant appearance of a
first night at the opera. All the ladies
who have secured boxes are going In full
evening dress, I understand, and the ef
fect Is sure to be a magnificent one.
Yesterday I went to Sloane's to see the
workmen put the last finishing touches
to that wonderful doll house, the gift of
the Misses Grace and Lillian Spreckels.
It is a love of a toy and is sure to make
even the most sedate of us forget dignity
and wish to "squat" down and play
"house" like in the long ago.
The doll house, which I believe is to be
raffled off, is a sort of a pocket addition
of a modern up-to-date millionaire's resi
dence. It is colonial in architecture, is
painted a blinking white and contains a
drawing room, dining room, a library, a
nursery, two sleeping apartments, kitchen,
bath room and a magnificent reception
hall.
Eight very swell sawdust people occupy
this miniature palace. There is papa and
mamma, who, by the way, are young and
attractive. Mamma's Bister, a blonde
debutante, and five precocious little ones
that have Inherited all of their parents'
beauty.
There Is also a whole retinue of servants
to wait upon the aristocrats who live in
this beautiful home; a nurse, a cook, a
chocolate-colored butler, a chambermaid,
not forgetting a messenger boy in a brand
new uniform and a faithful doggy, just
about to give a most ferocious bark.
The furnishing of the little house is all
that the most fastidious person could de
sire. The drawing room is in white and
gold. The furniture is after the pattern
of the time of Louis XVI, and is all up
holstered in most exquisite Bilk brocade.
The floor Is a hard-finished Inlaid one and
smooth enough for any bisque debutante
to glide over. The library Is rich in tone
and substantial in furnishings. The fur
niture is of carved Flemish oak, uphol
stered in a deep rich crimson velvet. The
carpet and curtains are in keeping with
the furniture. In a corner by a window,
on a carved oak pedestal, is a marble bust
of Dewey.
The hall, like the library, Is furnished
In shades of red. There is a tall, old
clock in one corner and in another hangs
a telephone, a main line one and without
a nickel attachment. In the hall there is
also a Flemish oak stand and gilt um
brella stand that is carefully stocked in
view of the near approach of the stormy
season.
The nursery Is finished In blue and white
and is crowded with comfortable chairs
and every sort of toy calculated to glad
den the heart of a youngster. In a gilded
cage there are singing: birds and on a ta
ble reposes a globe of gold fish.
My lady's chamber is a dainty room,
with white enameled furniture and pale
green satin hangings. Carpet, walls and
the upholstering are all in the most deli
cate shade of green. The dressing table
is draped in lace and loaded down with the
101 things my lady uses for her toilet.
The debutante's room Is in white and
pinkâ white embroidered furniture, with
pink satin hangings and upholÃtery.
The dining room is a magnificent apart
ment. The heavy furniture is of carved
Flemish oak, upholstered in green velvet
A magnificent carved oak sideboard, cov
ered with gorgeous sliver, takes up one
entire side of the spacious apartment.
The kitchen is complete in every detail.
There is even an ice chest, which, when
open, displays several "large bottles" that
I guess are Just the proper temperature.
Besides all this luxury, there Is a c tained
glass window in the upstairs hall, lace
curtains and draperies on all the windows,
handsome paintings on the walls and elec
tric lighting throughout the house.
The programme arranged for to-day's
show is as follows: *

with bunches of loosely tied pink rOses.
Pink candles with pink shades shed a soft
light over this table.
The second table was decorated all in
cool greens. Baskets of ferns and potted
plants with shining leaves made the board
most attractive. Green candles with green
shades furnished the illumination.
The third table was aglow with gor
geous hued autumn leaves that trained
their brilliant length upon the snowy
damask. Bright madrone berries min-*
gled with the magnificent foliage. On
this table red candles with red shades
were used.

WATER COLORS
ARE EXHIBITED
Opening Night at Insti
tute Attracts Good
Attendance.
Artists Show Pictures Under f
Auspices of Art Asso
ciation.
The water color exhibition of the am
Francisco Art Association opened last
night at the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art with a reception. The attendance was
not large, but many of thÂ« best-known
artists, critics and patrons were present
The water colors, pastels and alack and
whites of the exhibition are all bung in
the Mary Frances Searles gallery- The
first view of the water colors, by artificial
light was unfortunate and doubtless a
better impression will be created whan
visitors have seen the pictures by day
light.
Many bits of work of much merit arÂ»
to be seen on the four walls of the gal
lery and a number of them were greatly
admired last night and will continue to
attract favorable attention throughout the
exhibition. There are some, on the other
hand, that are decidedly amateurish and
the wonder is that the committee ever
accepted them.
Miss Annie Frances Brigga has flva
water colors on the north wall that are
excellent. All are landscapes. "Laren"
and "CreÂ£k In Southern California" are
the best, the former being particularly
strong.
Mrs. Lucia K. Mathews exhibits six
studies very modern and striking in a
poster-like way. One, numbered 15 In the
catalogue, a landscape study, has tjÂ» *Â¦
most merit. Miss Louise Schwamm h\ Â«
several studies of the same school ant 1
well executed.
G. F. P. Piazzoni's "Calm," a weird Im
pressionist landscape of strikingly low
tone, is Â§ne of the best things In the gal
lery. It, Miss Briggs' "Laren" and thÂ»
study by Mrs. Mathews are certainly not
far from the best three.
Latimer has a small water color, "In
the Pines," that Is good for the treatment
of the lights and shadows.
"Guadaloupe Creek," by Sidney J. Yard,
Is well done. Two others by the jams
artist are scarcely up to his standard.
Lillian Vesaria has four water colors.
Two of themâ "On the Maine Coast" and
"English Channel"â are as dainty bits or
landscape picturing as one would wish to
see.
M. de Neale Morgan exhibits two land
scapes, "The Edge of the Lake" and
"Evenfcig," a Berkeley scene, that axÂ«
meritorious.
"Birds of a Feather" and "Fantasy In
Black and White" are the best of a num
ber of water colors by Mrs. Wheelan, who
also has a number of black and white
studies and several book plate designs.
Miss Martha L. Johnson's studies in still
life are clever, one of brasses being espe
cially true In coloring.
A case of miniatures by Kunath, on the
south wall, attract much attention and
pral3e.
A portrait in pastel, by Matteo Sandona,
is a striking study of a young woman of
the Italian type. It is likely to be a#
much admired as anything in the gal
lery.
A large pastel. "Here Dies Another
Day," Is the best of the four pictures
shown by J. M. Griffin.
J. Montague Griswold has a Frenchy
bit of a quaintly humorous study, "Labor
Day 'n Brittany." There is scarcely defi
nition enough, but one is pleased by It.
Mr?. Alice M. Best's "Studies From
Boyville" are characteristically clever.
"Rejected." by Jack Tucker, is good in
coloring but the composition is poor.
"Mount Tamalpais" and "Lake Merrltt"
are Nvo dainty bits of Â«rork by Mazie B.
Nicholl.
Cadenasso, Judson. Hansen, Grlffln and
Neilson are all represented by pictures
not by any means up to their respective
standards.
The exhibition will last two weeks.
DAMKOSCH LECTURES
ON WAGNER'S OPERAS
Describes Conflict of Tradition With
Genius That Author Embodies
in "Die Meistersinger."
A large audience greeted Walter Dara
rosch, the favorite Wagnerian lecturer,
yesterday afternoon at the California the
ater. M-. Damrosch"9 subject of the day
was "Die Meistersinger" and the lecturer
described the everlasting conflict of tra
dition with genius that Wagner has em
bodied in this opera with apt and hu
morous phrase. "Die Meistersinger" is ""
Wagner's protest against the critic who
carps at the genius that finds expression
in new forms and throughout the opera
parody of the older forms is used with
fun and good humor. Mr. Damroscti'f
next lecture will be upon "Tristan and
Isolde," and will take place next Tues
day afternoon.

Had a Good Season. .
Tae steam whaler Beluga arrived from
the Arctic early yesterday morning. She
was off the mouth of the Mackenzie River
las': season, and the sailors say it was
"a mighty poor winter," but, neverthe
less-, the cap'ain and owners are satisfied.
The Beluga came from Fox Island in
thirteen day 6 and brings home 3Â»,000
poi:.nds of whalebone, 425 barrels of oil,
800 boxes of fox skins, 24 bear ekins, 20
musk ox eklns, 144 pounds of ivory and a
livo musk ox. The latter is the first of
its kind that has come here, and the crew
of :hÂ« vessel is very proud of it. The in
tention of the owners of the vessel is to
pressent the ox to the park, and an attempt
wli: be made to make it fraternize with
the elk and deer now in the reservation.
Died at Sea.
WTille the Beluga was on her way from
San Francisco to the Arctic late in 1900
there was an epidemic of pneumonia on
board. Many of the men recovered, but
still there were a few fatalities. On Oc
tober 25, 1900, A. W. L<ook, the first mate,
was taken 111 and, in spite of all attempts
on the part of the captain to relieve him,
be 3ied. On November 20 C. Jacobs, a
sailor, was also stricken and, in spite of

one year's imprisonment.

AUCTION SATYRS,
By G. H. Umbsen & Co.â Monday, November 11. at 12
o'clock. Real Estate, at 14 Montgomery street.
THE GENERAL RESULT.
THE result of the State elections in the East
offers not a ray of hope to the Democracy,
which Bryan has so thoroughly demoralized
that it seems incapable of reinstatement in public con
fidence. While it is not gratifying that a Repnblican
machine like that in Pennsylvania maintains its grip
on the State, yet that is owing to the overwhelming
Republican sentiment there, and to the feeling that
anything is better than the giving of aid and com
fort to the Bryan movement.
The extreme communistic programme of Mr.
Josiah Quincy in Massachusetts was no lure to the
voters, and his plan for uniting conservatives and
radicals under the same banner has failed utterly.
The effort to Tomjohnson Ohio has met with no
better success, and the Nebraska fusion has gone
down under the sense of Republican amity and the
frowns of such old Democratic leaders as J. Sterling
Morton.
The only reaction is in Maryland, where in running
from Wellington the voters have run into the arms
of Gorman. The race issue was potent in that re
sult, as it was in Virginia, and the net conclusion
from all the elections is that the South will stay with
the race problem and vote anti-Republican, while the
North will stay with national prosperity and progress
and remain Republican.
The race issue out of the way. the country would
be as unanimous politically and as little partisan as
in the "golden age." when Monroe had all the elec
toral votes but one, and that cast against him only be
cause the elector said he wanted no man unanimously
elected President. He was a Monroe man, but wanted
to be different from the mass.
The South is prospering and desires to continue
prosperous, and. freed from her ethnological afflic
tion, would join the rest of the country and be Re
publican. But that is an indifferent matter. The
majority is Republican, and there is no sign of a
change. The party must not forget its responsibility
nor sleep at its post. It is strong enough to do right
and old enough to know what right is.
The unanimity of present political conditions does
not mean that its power is never to be challenged,
but if in time fate overtake it let Republicanism be
found with its hand on the plow and with every wheel
turning and every ship full of cargo and every mouth
fed.
That this will be the case no student of economy
doubts. Just what form the opposition will take next
no eye can foresee. With the two methods of fusion
beaten in their homes, in Massachusetts and Ne
braska, it may well be that the opposition will be in
effect abandoned to the socialists, and that party may
become the residuary legatee of the political estate
which Mr. Bryan has bankrupted.
The enormous pluralities in Ohio and lowa in an
off year and with a light vote show that Republican
*rm is as strong in the agricultural as in the manu
facturing sections of the country. Even Tammany
has gone down, and that sole remaining Democratic
power is destroyed. If the negro question were out
of the way a motion to make it unanimous would be
in order.
One of the arguments used in the East for the'
speedy construction of the Nicaraguan canal is that
when completed it will "make a wonderful difference
in the price of California oranges in the Eastern mar
ket." It is hardly necessary to say we are hoping it
will also make a difference in the price here.
Senator Aldrich is reported to have said there will
be no tinkering with the protective tariff this winter,
either directly or by the so-called reciprocity treaties,
and as the Senator is an authority on such subjects
his statements will be gratifying to the country.
From the frequency with which British dispatches
repeat that the illness of the King is not serious it
would Â»eetn to be serious enough to trouble some
body and keep him watching.
THE RIVAL CANALS.
LAST winter The Call predicted that the admin
istration would have control of the canal ques
tion in such a way as to overcome any further
use of obstructive tactics. The enemies of the isth
mian canal, being dislodged from all other positions,
assumed a patriotic air and talked the star-spangled
banner. They wanted the canal and the shores of
Lake Nicaragua converted into a continuous Ameri
can fortress, with the flag flying like a streak of glory
from sea to sea, the cannons roaring and the bands
playing "Yankee Doodle." In order to effect this
continuous vaudeville performance the rest of the
world was to be snubbed and larruped. But in the
process the canal was going to be made so costly that
unless part of its cost were charged off the investment
to be borne directly by American taxpayers in appro
priations for the War Department the tolls for using
the waterway would be prohibitive.
While not all who opposed the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty were enemies of the canal, the opposition to
that treaty got its impulse from such enemies, be
cause its defeat meant delay and time to inflame na
tional feeling to the pitch of demands that would
make the canal impossible.
It was evident then that the administration would
negotiate another treaty with Great Britain, and if
it were beaten by the hullaballoo tactics employed
before would have a proposition for the Panama
canal so favorable that with its freedom from Euro
pean complications it would compel the obstruction
ists to show their hands and assume their true char
acter, that of enemies of the project they pretended to
favor.
Since this prediction was made the Panama Canal
Company has abated its attitude of independence,
and. by the tacit consent of its grantor, the republic
of Colombia, is offering terms so favorable that our
Government finds itself in position to use them to
force the Nicaragua project to a vote over all dilatory
tactics.
Ever since Humboldt wrote his "Political Essay on
the Kingdom of New Spain," in which he discussed
an isthmian canal as a work worthy of the attention
of Spain, then the owner of the isthmus, the Nicar
agua and Panama routes have been equally promi
nent and about equally favored by engineers, capital
ists and navigators.
Panama offers the shortest route, only about thirty
miles. The Nicaragua utilizes Nicaragua Lake and
the San Juan River, and requires a system of locks.
The original design of De Lesseps for the Panama
csnal was a sea level waterway, requiring no lockage,
enabling greater economy of operation and short
ening the time required to pass from ocean to ocean.
With a choice of routes, and with all the engineer
ing data at hand, it may be confidently anticipated
that the coming session of Congress will settle the
canal question and enable the beginning of the work.
Surely it is time. That waterway has been under dis
cussion more than ? century. It has been an cbjtct
of interest to American statesmanship since Jeffer
son was our representative in France in 1788 and
wrote to Mr. Carmichael at Madrid: "With respect
tc the IsthmtÃ of Panama, I am assured by Bu.-goin
that a survey. was made, that a canal was practicable,
and that the idea was suppressed for political reasons
altogether. He has seen and minutely examined the
report. This report is to me a vast desideratum, for
reasons political and philosophical."
Clay, when Secretary of State in 1825, wrote to
Senor de Canaz, first diplomatic representative of the
Central American republic to "Washington: "The
idea has been long conceived of uniting these two
seas by a canal navigation. The execution of it will
form a great epoch in the commercial affairs of the
whole world. Various lines for the proposed canal
have been suggested and have divided public opinion.
The evidence tending to show the superiority of the
advantages of that which would traverse the province
of Nicaragua seems to have nearly settled the ques
tion in favor of that route." That was seventy-six
years ago, and no canal yet! The "great epoch in
the commercial affairs of the whole world" is not yet.
Surely it will not wait beyond the. next session of
Congress.
The care which President Roosevelt is exercising
in the selection of horses for use in Washington has
attracted the attention of newspaper men in that city,
and the result is we are getting a good deal of inter
esting information concerning the subject. Thus, a
correspondent of the Philadelphia Public Ledger re
cently said: "It is really a hard matter to buy a
horse for driving in Washington. If a large and
stylish animal is wanted great care must be given to
his way of going or he will be likely to pound his
feet to pieces on the asphalt. Here there is asphalt
everywhere and it is tough stuff to work a horse on.
The hoof is always badly strained in the never
ending impact, and also dries to a brittle state that
develops quarter cracks." It would appear from all
that information that the streets of which Washington
has been bragging so much are hardly fit for any
thing except bicycles or automobiles.
A MATTER OP BIGNESS.
FROM statements made by the officers of the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, to be held af
St. Louis, it appears to be their intention to
make a bigger exposition than any ever before held.
All their talk is of bigness. We hear nothing about
quality. Whether the exposition is to be beautiful,
interesting, instructive, does not count. The one
thing to be achieved is to make it in every respect a
"mammoth aggregation of stupendous details," as the
circus posters have it.
The Columbian exposition at Chicago occupied 666
acres of ground, but the St. Louis people have set
apart 1200 acres in Fcrest Park for their exposition,
and now the managers are asking for 200 acres more,
so as to have 1400 for what they call their "colossal
fair."
To provide enormous structures for the huge area
they have already raised more money than Chicago
had to begin with, and they expect much more. For
the Columbian Exposition Chicago raised $5,000,000
by public subscription, $5,000,000 by municipal bonds
and $2,750,000 more was obtained from the Federal
Government, making a total of $12,750,000. St.
Louis has raised $5,000,000 by public subscription,
$5,000,000 by municipal bonds, $5,000,000 from the
United States Government and $1,000,000 from the
State of Missouri, making a total of $16,000,000 to
start with. The total cost of the Columbian Exposi
tion is estimated at $18,322,000, and the St. Louis
officials estimate the total cost of their enterprise at
$30,000,000.
One of the big features of the exposition will be the
building designed for the exhibits of agriculture.
The structure is to cover 32J4 acres, and it is said it
will be the largest exposition building ever erected.
One of the officials in describing it in a recent inter
view said: "It will be 700 by 2000 feet in dimensions.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1901.
There will be room in it for a mile racetrack." There
are to be other huge record-breaking structures.
Among them will be the manufacturers' building No*
1, 600 by 1200 feet; transportation building, 600 by
1200 feet; mines and metallurgy building, 600 by
1200 feet; the United States Government building
will cover 100,000 square feet. Other buildings, all
the largest of their kind ever used for exposition
purposes, are the electricity, the liberal arts, the
education, the social economy, the service. The
total cost of these buildings has been estimated at
$7,000,000.
In one respect the St. Louis enterprise will fall be
low the magnitude of that at Chicago â the art de
partment will not be so large as that at the Colum
bian Exposition; but the St. Louis official who ad
mitted the defect was prompt to add that the quality
will be much finer. Then the St. Louis Exposition
expects to prove superior to all predecessors in the
extent to which it will be a live show. Thus we are
told: "There will be the cotton mill in operation.
There will be the pork-packing house in operation.
There will be the cheese factory in operation. There
will be the zinc, lead, coal and gold and silver mines
and the smelter in operation. Everything will be 'on
the move.' "
Finally, St. Louis is to have a big thing in the way
of a novelty, bigger than the Tour Eiffel or the Fer
ris wheel. It is to be an "aerial globe," built of steel
and glass, with a circumference of a thousand feet
and a capacity to hold 25,000 people. It is to be
chuck full of amusements from bottom to top, and we
are told: "There will be room for thousands to en
joy an a la carte evening meal while feasting their
eyes upon semi-tropical luxuriance of plants and
flowers in all their glory, and ever and anon looking
upward at the awe-inspiring steel arches, 175 feet
high, and eight in number, which will, rise from the
edge of the garden and meet at the extreme top of
the* globe under the observatory tower room, 570 feet
above the ground."
Really St. Louis seems determined to push bigness
to the limit. Possibly she marks the end of that
kind of extravagance. After the big thing has been
seen we may hope there will be a return to reason
among our people and that expositions hereafter will
aim not at irTere magnitude, but at something of ar
tistic excellence. Already there are many Americans
who would rather not see so much than have to
see so many things that are not worth seeing.
Should Liverpool and Glasgow establish a quar
antine to prevent the import of some plague from
Italy it would occasion no surprise, but it is rather
odd to learn from European dispatches that Naples
and Genoa have established a quarantine against
Glasgow and Liverpool. It is the belief of
the Italians that the two British ports are infected
with bubonic plague and they are taking no chances.
AS the trustees of the Mechanics' Institute, at
the request of the Park Commissioners, have
turned over to the park authorities the aqua
rium tanks in the Mechanics' Pavilion, it is fair to
assume that it is the intention to establish at Golden
Gate Park the foundation of an aquarium. It is grati
fying to have such a movement under way. The
aquarium may have to begin in but a small way, but
there is a possibility of making it one of the foremost
if not the very foremost in the world.
An elaborate aquarium would be something more
than a spectacle for the people, however excellent it
would be in that way. At the present time scientific
research is largely directed to the ocean and the mar
velous life that goes on within its depths. Wherever
an aquarium of any scientific value is established stu
dents assemble from all parts of the civilized world.
It is therefore possible to add to the prestige of the
city as a center of science and of learning by provid
ing here an aquarium that would be fairly represen
tative of the fishes of the Pacific Ocean.
San Francisco has advantages of situation and of
climate which will help to lighten the cost of making
and maintaining a large aquarium. The proximity
to the sea renders it comparatively easy to obtain sea
water for the tanks and to obtain the fish that are
to dwell in them. The mildness of the climate
throughout the year will save the heavy cost which
other cities have to bear to keep the waters from
freezing in the winter. Thus the undertaking of an
aquarium does not involve the Park Commissioners
in any kind of costly enterprise.
It may be accepted as fairly certain that when once
an aquarium has been established it will become oije
of the most popular resorts at the park. Public ap
proval will be given to its extension, and perhaps lib
eral contributions may be made by generous citizens.
The movement, therefo-e, is one that tends in the
right direction, and it is to be hoped it will go briskly
forward.
In a recent address to young men Secretary Gage
said: "Nothing succeeds like success. To succeed
make your services felt, but do not blow your own
horn too much, and you will find an empty Presi
dent's chair waiting for you in the end." The advice
sounds well, but aspiring young men had just as well
take notice that up to this time in the history of our
country the President's chair has never yet been
found empty and waiting for somebody to fill it.
Kaiser Wilhelm has issued a manifesto to his troops
who served in China warmly thanking them for their
services and declaring they have added "fresh laurels
to the ancient glory of the German arms." The praise
sounds a little bit large for the size of the war. but
then it must be remembered the invasion of China is
the only military glory the Kaiser has had, and he
must make the most of it.
The sporting season in Maine is unusually brilliant
this year. Already a dozen men have been shot by
mistake for deer, and one hunter was fortunate
enough to bag two men at one fire, while another
shot a friend in the foot by mistake for a rabbit.
Altogether it is about the most strenuous year Maine
has ever had.
Joseph Chamberlain has once more declared in
favor of reducing the number of Irish representatives
in Parliament, but it may be he is making the bluff
just to get people to quit thinking about the fiasco
he made of the Boer war.
How would it do to propose to those Bulgarian
bandits that if they will give up Miss Stone without
a ransom they may have permission to come to the
United States and run a melodrama or a comic opera
for a year?
It is predicted that this will prove to be the banner
year of the grocery trade, so it is evident the people
are living well and are able to pay for it.
Now that the elections are over, if the autumn rains
would only come along in good measure everybody
would be happy.

NINE YEARS WALKING
AROUND THE WORLD
NIKOLAUZ DOUBAY, WHO SET OUT NINE YEARS AGO TO COVKR
THE EARTH ON FOOT AND SAYS A FOURTH OF HIS JOURNEY
REMAINS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED.
NIKOLAUZ DOUBAY, a Cossack, decided nine years ago to walk all over
the world. Now, he says, three-quarters of his trip is over. Most men
think they are well traveled when they have gone around the world, "but
a mere circumference omits so much interesting area." says Doubay.
"What is discernible of a country from a car window is so superficial."
he adds.
Doubay reckons on one day a week without anything to eat. He also reckons
in the United States on seven dayq a week without doing any work. "I haven't
done any yet in this country," said he to a Chicago Tribune man the- other day,
"and I don't want to. It takes too long. You cant cover much ground if you are
always interrupted by working. If I wanted to work I would have staid at
home, but I'll write a book about all the countries In the world instead. I expect
to be at home in four years. lam going to San Francisco and then south
through Mexico and Central and South America, and then to Australia. I gen
erally work my way in boats in the kitchen or as messboy, or sometimes as
deckhand. I sleep out. I never use the railroad, except that in damp weather I
sometimes walk between the tracks. When I get home I'll stay there"
Doubay was born in Vladikofas, Caucasus, thirty-three years ajco " He went
into the Russian army and came out with a taste for adventure Suddenly much
to the disgust of his father, he acquired a love for reading. Columbus Cabot
Drake, Kidd and Cook excited him into a declaration he would like travel for itÂ«J
own sake. Accordingly, in 1892, he started out. having, after the fashion of Esau
relinquished all rights in his patrimony to a younger brother He went across
the Caspian to the foot of the Urals, across them, and then straight across to
Vladivostok. There were no railways then, but it only took him eleht month* to
make the trip. He spent two months in a Siberian gold mine Kettin* two ruhip*
a day. Doubay proceeded through Manchuria and Korea to Japan thence to Su
matra, Ceylon, India, Baluchistan, Afgnanistan and Persia. He staid six months
in Constantinople, learning something of the Turkish language. Then he crossed
Europe.
He was wrecked off Newfoundland in the Lustania, last June and to thla
fact the Russian Consul General to Canada bears witness. His papers were care
fully examined by Baron Schlippenbach, the Russian Consul at Chicae-o an.i

GENERAL. GRANTâ Reader of The

did attain a higher rank In the army than
that of lieutenant general. The grade of
general waa first created by act of Con

ton was appointed to fill It. This rank
was, after the death of Washington, abol
ished and It was not revived again until
1866, when it was conferred upon Grant.
Upon the flection of Grant to the Presi
dency William T. Sherman succeeded him
in the grade of general. On the retire
ment of General Sherman, November 1
1883, the office again became extinct It
was revived for Lieutenant Phil H. Sheri

1888 and since his death In that year the
rank has been extinct.

It would seem that Earl Roberts, amid
I his many duties, finds time to follow the
i literature of the war. He was much
! struck lately. I am told, by some cam
! paign sketches which were modestly pub
j lished without the writer's name attached
I In one of the magazines. He asked kind'v
i about the author, with the result that the
i articles will shortly appear in a book.
Herbert Vivian has written a critical
study of the life of Lord BeaconsfleUl
from his own peculiar ultra modern, m
tra Tory standpoint. It is an interesting,
! little known fact that after the death of
j the "Whirlwind, that short-lived weekly,
I which Vivian and the Hon. Stuart Ers
i kine edited in ISB9. Vivian was brought ;i
i good deal into contact with the late Lor 1
Randolph Churchill. The conversations
they had are said to have largely Influ
enced the study of Lord BeaconsfleUl.
which has just been finished. Vivian
previous books have been mostly records
of his travels. He is at present editing
the resuscitated Rambler. He was born
in 1866 and comes, as his name implies.
! of a Cornish family. .
There was, by the way. some talk a'
short time ago of a critical study of Lor.l
Beaconafleld by Israel Zangwill, but Ike
idea seems to have been abandoned.
[ ZangrwlU â¢ included Lord Beaconsfleld. it
will be remembered, in his "Dreamers 01
the Ghetto." At present the author or
"Children of the Ghetto" is busy fulfilling
commissions for short stories, which have
been accumulating during the time he
was writing his recent novels and plays.
I am told that Lady Sykes Is again
1 about to become an editor. Her new
I paper is to be Â«i weekly, which will be en
tirely under her own supervision. Lady
Sykes' pet hobby is newspaper work, of
which, by the way, she has very goo 1
practical knowledge.
Marion Crawford's next story. "The
Harvest of the Sword," Is said to be the
most ambitious yet written, for in it he
introduces a series of characters memora
ble In history and literature. It turns
upon the struggles of the Guelfs , an.l
Ghibellines and Francesca da Rimini.
Count Ugollno and Dante are all intro
duced. The story will begin Its career in
: the Sphere some time next year.
Encouraged by his success, that young
author Neil Munro, who has come so rap
idly to the front lately, has been very
busy with a new novel, "The Shoes o:
Fortune," said by those who have see
the manuscript to be by far the finest ef
fort he has yet made. The scene is laid
, in Scotland and France in the year 175 C. 5
The hero is a young lad, new from a
Scottish college, who Inherits from an
uncle a trivial legacy and the so-called
"shoes of fortune, " which have been
worn in many wanderings by the uncl-Â»
and are J credited by the nephew with
magic qualities for inspiration and stim
ulation. They. play a curious part in the
story, leading the hero into many excit
ing adventures.
A record has been obtained at Hodg
son's auction rooms for a beautiful folio
Watteau, which passed for Â£665 ($3325) t 1
Hodgson's underbidden being a Paris
agent. These volumes are uniformly
bound In old French morocco and bear
the arms of Louis Joachim, Potler Due
de Gesvres, 1733-1794, with a fleur-de-lis
stamped on the four corners. The im
pressions of the plates are fine through
out, but a few are slightly soiled. It is a
curious fact that the number of plates
varies in each known copy of this rare
work. In this case the number is well
above the average.
There has been a report that the dispute
between Messrs. Pearson and Hall Came
has been settled, but that. I am informed.
Is quite unfounded.
The case will probably be heard toward
the middle of November. Lewis & Lewis
have acted throughout for Mr. Came and
eminent counsel have been engaged oa
both sides. '....,.
On one occasionâ one at leastâ Albert
Chevalier had supper with Rudyard Kip
ling, when the latter recited a poem he
had just written. An account of this
meeting, which could hardly have been
dull, is being given away by Chevalier in
his forthcoming autobiography.
He begins his own life early, at the
sixth year, but then, of course, he began
early to make a figure in the world.
He classes as foremost among the
events of his life the tour which he made
in America. I believe that, although
Chevalier has often been interviewed, the
best stories remain to appear In his book.

JUDGE ADVOCATE LEMLY CLOSES ARGUMENT
WITH A TRIBUTE TO THE BRAVERY OF SCHLEY
PAYS TRIBUTE TO BRAVE SCHLEY.
FROM my knowledge of the man, having served under his com
mand on two cruisers, I have never believed nor do I claim
from the evidence that personal misconductâ or, to call a spade
a spade, cowardiceâ was exhibited by Commodore Schley in any
part of his career as commander-in-chief of the flying squadron. But
I submit with regret that in the passage from Key West to Cienfue
gos, while at the latter port en route to the southward of Santiago
without settled destination, in :he retrograde, movement, in the vi
cinity of Santiago and in the affair of May 31, the admiral exhibited
unsteadiness in purpose and in push and failure to obey orders.â
Statement made by Judge Advocate Lemly In closing the Schley
case.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7.â After
eitting in session for over
forty days and with a record
which when completed will
cover about 2000 pages, the
Schley court of inquiry, at 3:45 this after
noon, adjourned its last public session.
To Captain S. C. Lemly. the Judge advo
cate, had been assigned the duty of mak
ing the closing argument in the case and
soon after he had finished his speech,
Admiral Dewey. bringing: his gavel down
on the big flat table, said:
"There being no further business, the
court is adjourned."
As was the case yesterday when At
torney Raynor spoke, the attendance was
large. There was only one session dur
ing the day. It began at 2 o'clock and
the entire time was taken up with Cap
tain Lemly's address. He read his speech
in clear and distinct tones and was given
careful attention. The speech in the
main was an analysis of the testimony,
but occasionally a conclusion was drawn
and frequently there was criticism of
the course pursued by Admiral (then
Commodore) Schley.
After adjournment the members of the
court. Admiral Schley and his counsel
lingered for a time about the hall in
which they recently have spent so much
of their time, and. there were many af
fectionate words of farewell spoken." Ad
miral Sehley, as usual, was called upon
to receive the greetings of a number of
admirers and a hundred or more people
waited at the door of the hall to bid him
adieu.
Captain I^emly used no formality In
beginning his address when the court con
vened, but rising quietly from his seat
opposite the tribunal, began to rdfid. He
said at the outset that his plan contem
plated first, a response to the statements
of Admiral Schley's counsel and then a
presentation of the subject in hand on an
independent basis. He requested to be
corrected if he should make any errors
of facts. He then entered upon a careful
analysis of the testimony brought out at
the hearing.
Explains Schley's Mission.
Referring to the testimony of Admiral Schley
and Captain Chadwick concerning the lormer's
conversation with Admiral Sampson at Key
West Captain Lemly said:
"I ask the court <o apply to the applicant
as a witness the well-known rule referred to
with such fervor by senior counsel that where
two witnesses testify with regard to the same
matter and one of them remembers and the
other merely remembers the circumstances of
the matter, or let us say the conversation,
the evidence of him who remembers must be

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1901.
accepted. If this be done then there is little
left of the evidence given before this court
by the applicant, particularly upon his cross
examination.
"Commodore Schley has testified," said Cap
tain Lemly, further along in his address "that
lie consulted Commodore Remey at the navy
baÃe . Key West, May 18. and at that time
the latter had information as to the move
ments of the Spaniards. So had Admiral Samp
son on the ISth. And for what, if not to meet
the enemy's fleet, was Schley sent to Cien
rueros? Not because he expected to find them
already in there, as the cr<!er No. 6 and Ad
miral Schley's testimony will clearly show It
was simply understood that the Spaniards
would endeavor to reach Cienfuegos and not
that they were there."
Referring to Raynor's statement that when
the report of the Spaniards being at Santiago
was confirmed nothing was done to Inform
commodore Schley of this until the Hawk
?I*
was sent on the afternoon of May 21. Captain
Lemly said the Marblehead was sent at 3 a.
m. of May 21 with the dispatch No. 8. !
"It is true," he added, "that this copy did
not reach Commodore Schley until the 24th.
.When Hood, on the Hawk, was sent on the
afternoon of the 21st he carried as a separate
communication the memorandum order on page
466 of the appendix, and this confirms Hood's
testimony that at that time Admiral Sampson
regarded It as a practical certainty that the
Spanish squadron was at Santiago."
The McCalla Memorandum.
Both of the counsel appear, he said, to Ignore
the very important parts of the McCalla mem
orandum.
"The latter part clearly showed," he said,
"Commander McCalla' communication with
the insurgents and their Intimate acquaintance
with the matters in the city."
Captain Lemly contended that the McCalla
memorandum was delivered to Commodore
Schley May 22. and charged the commodore
with failure to attempt communication with
the Insurgents after its receipt. Speaking of
] the charge of disobedience of orders Captain
Lemly said: . â¢
"The applicant's disobedience, if proved, will
be shown to be delaying In bringing his force
to the presence of the enemy. With the con
clusion of the very brief address with which I
shall close the argument in this Inquiry my offi
cial connection with it ends and the matter is
placed in capable hands. I may add that while
my duties here have been arduous and neces
sarily somewhat painful I am proud to have
| been associated with the distinguished court
! which Is to pass upon the most important ques
tion ever considered by a naval court; a ques
tion as I defined it In the early course of the
proceedings between the applicant and the
moral effect to the service. In entering upon
I my duties as Judge advocate of the court I
had in mind the advice given me by the Sec
retary of the Navy Department : 'A perfectly
impartial court is constituted. The judge ad
vocate and any counsel assisting him are not
(and their duty In this respect is plain) in
court to prosecute anybody or to find anybody
guilty, but to brine out the facts Â«nd aid the
court in declaring the truth." â¢'.. â¢ J. ..
"I have endeavored to follow this advice
without fear or favor. If I have appeared to fall
in maintaining that impartial attitude which
I feel and have always felt toward the appli
cant, it Is because aggression, however natural
on the part of earnest counsel, begets aggres
sion and for the further reason that In many
instances throughout the investigation the dif
ference of opinion .has compelled me to be
earnestly contentious in order to adduce what
I believed to be material facts. I deem It not
inappropriate tlfat I should here remark that
the Navy Department has maintained an en
tirely neutral attitude; that as the record dem
onstrate*, there has been I*lo alteration of the
department's Tecords: that officers on duty
even In the much-abused Bureau of Naviga
tion have fredy testified in behalf of the ap
plicant; and I am confident that the evidence
In the ca=>2 adduced fully Justified the views
of th.? department, set ; forth in Its reply of
February 6. 1899, to the Senate Committee on
Naval Affairs, - wherein it is said of Commo
dore Schley. referring particularly to the battle
of July 3, 'where so much was achieved In this
culminating battle and where his ship was
such a conspicuous force in the fight, his con
duct, while In independent command prior to
June 1, the record of which has been given
above and which, by. reason of his unsteadiness
In purpose and in push and In failure to obey
orders, did not meet the approval of the Presi
dent, yet was not permitted to stand In the
way of his rromollnn for the part he took in
the final triumph.' " '
Speed Not Great Enough.
Captain Lemly then said that the voluminous
testimony had been so fully treated that It was
not his purpose to enter upon a detailed dis
cussion of .it. He said that under the then
existing conditions of the wind and weather
greater speed might have been maintained on
| the passage from Key West to Clenfuegos. It
; should, he thought, be remembered that Com
| modore Schley's orders required that the block
i ade of Hint port be established, that the least
1 possible delay be Incurred. . Lemly added: "Al
! though, as appeared from their conversation,
; Commodore Schley, though assured by Captain
1 Chester, was troubled over the coal problem,
; demonstrating that at the very outset he was
, borrowing trouble." -.._:.. . , . â¢
Referring to the McCalla signals, he said it
was clear that the Marblehead had not ar
rived at Key West when the flying squadron
sailed, it', therefore that these signals could
not have been communicated to Commodore
S;hley there. ,
"There Is l!ttle doubt, however," he said,
"that if the c< mtnedore had. upon meeting the
Marblehead. directed Commander' McCalla to
report en beard the flagship he- would .have
[ been fully Informed a? to the signals, notwith
i ("tending the commander's declared purpose to

self, instead of relying solely upon the efforts
of others? ' Â¦ - Ââ¢-:-,-
"The fact, however, is clear, that the appli

orandum on the morning of May 23; and at

The ; Judge advocate eaid . the evidence was'
full as to the coal pupply and the log books of
the vepfieU do not record bad condition Â¦ of
weather, hut on the contrary. The arrival of
the Adula was purely accidental and â¢ little
stress should be laid upon the assumption 'Â¦ that
the vessel was peimitted by the Spanish au
thorities to return with information as to
whether the Spanish squadron was In the har
bor, and this - In view of the fact that a hos

CHIEFS OF THE OPPOSING COUNSEL DURING THE PRESENTATION
OF EVIDENCE AT THE SCHLEY INQUIRY AND SOME INTEREST
ING SCENES AT THE HISTORIC NAVAL COURT JUST CLOSED.
Concerning the voyage from Clenfuegos, Cap
tain Lemly salil:
"The commodore's orders directed that he
proceed with all dispatch, cautiously, to San
tiago. He certainly proceeded slowly. But
Â¦cautiously' did not weaken the force of the
words." â¢
The great military necessity at this time
was to find and check the enemy's fleet. Cau
tion was needed lest it might pass unde
tected to Cienfuegos, or lest it might be
stumbled upon without preparation if neither
carried lights. The greatest caution was de
miinded. Finally the flying squadron did not
leave with dispatch nor with caution, as shown
by the fact with regard to the latter condi
tion, that he was using the Ardols signals for
hours after getting under way. It would ap
po .r that there was little to prevent its de
parture for the eastward from being discov
ered and In due course communicated to San
tiago. He admitted that the weather on the
\oyage wns bad for the smeller boats, par
ticularly the Eagle, and said that the speed
ot the squadron was slowed in order that they
n:lght keep up. He continued, however, say
ing that If that vessel was to be sent away she
should have been co sent at the â¢ yme when
she was causing the delay and not when the
voyage was practically completed and the
weather improved. In this connection he sug
gested that all the slower vessels, in view of
the urgency of the situation, might have been
assigned a rendezvous, to be Joined later by
the light vessels.
"If a drummer boy stubs his toe," he arked,
"do* the army halt?" Having brought the
squadron to the southward of Santiago on
May 28, the judge advocate took up the coal
ing question, quoting the testimony of Lieu
tenant Dyson on the question of the coal sup
ply in some detail. Then he considered the
retrogade movement. This step had been un
dertaken without sufficient consideration of
the conditions at the harbor of Santiago, leav
ing the mouth of the harbor unwatched, and
(Vrvera free to escape, with a possibility of
his making a descent upon our coastâ the
moriil, to say nothing of the material effect, of
which It Is impossible to overestimate."
Criticizes Pilot Nunez.
Continuing in this connection, he said: "It
matters not what Captain Sigsbee or Pilot
Nunez told Commodore Schley. If Nunez had
displayed no greater acumen than when before
this court, this Information he supplied should
be regarded with very little weight.' I believe
the captain never said the Spanish fleet was
not there, and the commodore alone was re
sponsible for the retroeade movement. It was
his duty to ascertain whether the Spanish
Fhips were in the harbor, an obligation which
no negative information of Captain Sigsbee
could remove. And it is inconceivable that a
positive statement as to the contents of a
harbor of the weJJ-known curvature of San
tiago could have been made by Sigsbee."
The details of the retrogade movement were
rehearsed, as were those concerning the deliv
ery of dispatches by the Harvard and the prof
fers ol Lieutenant Beale to go ashore and
communicate with the Cuban insurgents.
Captain Lemly contended that the dispatch
conveying positive information of the pres
ence of the Spaniards must have been deliv
ered to Commodore Schley, notwithstanding
his denial, but he said it was remarkable that
Captain Cotton should not have communicated
Its contents to the commodore.
Here he quoted In full Commodqre Schley's
"Cannot obey" dispatch of May 27, and com
mented upon it, saying:
"Whether the department's instructions defi
nitely directed, in positive terms, that the
Mjuadron remain off Santiago, or whether its
desire that this should be done, was simply
indicated, appears to me under all the cir
cumstances to be Immaterial. Disobedience
of orders may be an imperative and glorious
duty, but If it be not Justified it cannot be
condoned by terming it an error of Judgment
This was not an error of judgment, but ati
error of conduct." Â¦Â¦
Colon Not Destroyed.
Bringing the squadron back to Santiago, the
judge advocate said that nothing was done
toward attacking the enemy until May 31
when the reconnolssance or bombardment was
made, the total time of all firing then being
r.even minutes and forty-five seconds.
"The Colon was not destroyed or disabled
and, with the possible exception of one shot'
.ill fell short, only three vessels of the force
available were employed In this affair It has
been claimed that the effects of this affair of
May 31 was to develop the enemy's batteries
and that this was accomplished there is, how
ever, a great deal of doubt, in view of thÂ«
varying signals and statements made by the
commodore, both before and after the action
as to what was the real object, whether a re
connoissance or an attempt to destroy the Co
lon. The defense to the failure to go In close
on May 31 by pleading at this time the cau
tionary order of April 8 does not appear to be
sufficient, even if the commodore was ac
quainted with its contents. The order modifies
Declares, However,
the Commodore Did
Not Obey the Orders
of His Commander
itself and from first to last clearly Indicates
that our fleet was to be kept for the Spanish
ships and that the destruction of the latter was
Its paramount mission."
Coming to the battle of July 3, Captain Lemly
saif! :
"I have never doubted, and the evidence ad
duced confirm my view in this respect, that
the Brooklyn, as a ship, did conspicuous duty
in this battle. On the other hand. I submit
that the evidence shows that It was a captain's
fight, and, without disparagement of Commo
dore Schley's personal conduct on that occa
sion, that there was no such concerted action
of the vessels engaged as to Indicate their con
trol by any one person. All evidently strove to
do their utmost and thus was accomplished one
of the grandest naval victories ever won. Of
course, the vessels stood In toward the harbor
entrance when It was discovered the enemy's
vessels were making a sortie. Such was their
natural and proper course under such circum
stance.. In like manner, when the Spanish
fleet stood to the westward. It was the duty of
our vessels to follow, whether or not the signal
'Follow flagship' was made."
Brooklyn's Famous Turn.
Discussing the Brooklyn's loop Captain Lemlj
expressed the opinion, based upon evidence,
that in turning to starboard when all the other
American vessels turned to port the Brooklyn
endangered not only the Texas, but other ves
sels as well. It was, he said, clearly estab
lished that the Texas stopped and that she re
versed one or both of her engines. The respon
sibility for this movement, he 1 argued, rested
entirely upon Commodore Schley and it could
not be delegated to any one by him as a squad
ron commander.
"Captain Cook's evidence on this point seems
as a whole," he said, "to indicate that re con
sidered himself In a naval duel, and initiated
the turn to starboard without so much as ask
ing the commodore, within a few feet of him
whether he approved a step that involved
squadron iftovements. This confirms the im
pression upon which I have already enlargedâ
that the battle of Santiago was a captain's
fight. At best the loop was a tremendous risk,
and. I submit, without adequate justification
Whatever the distance the Brooklyn ran In
making this turn he contended that she did
turn around. Instead of toward the enemy.
"It would seem." he said, "that she should
have made the other course, if not for the pur
pose of placing herself nearer Cervera's ships.
at least In order to escape any possibility of
endangering or delaying the other vessels of
our squadron. For, had she been more imper
iled Individually by starboarding her helm no
injury to her from the enemy could have
equaled the dire results of the ships virtually
committing suicide.
"And think of the effect upon the enemy of
a turn with a starboard helnv which appears
to have been disregarded. Taking the distance
at the time the turn was begun at the lowest
figure given, say 1000 yards, the Brooklyn would
not have run the entire tactical diameter to
ward the enemy If she had turned to port, par
ticularly if she had backed the port engine in
turning."
Commodore and the Texas.
After discussing briefly the Hodgson incident
and Commodore Schley's alleged remark
"Damn the Texas." which he said he did not
consider a very grave matter. Captain Lemly
closed his speech and the entire argument of
the case with the following words:
"From my knowledge of the man. having
served under his command on two cruisers I
have never believed, nor do I claim from the
evidence that personal misconduct or. to call
a spade a spade, cowardice was exhibited by
Commodore Schley In any part of his career
as commander In chief of the flying squadron
But I submit with regret that In the passage
from Key West to Cienfuegos, while at the lat
ter port en route to the southward of Santiago
without settled destination in the retrograde
movement. In the return to the vicinity of San
tiago, and in the affair of May 31, the com
modore exhibited unsteadiness in purpose and
In push and failure to obey orders. The char
acterization of this conduct is, however, for
the court. I trust that I may be pardoned If I
remind you, gentlemen, that the first Impor
tance of the matters before you Is not as they
relate to any Individual, but as they concern
the naval service. It Is for you to lay down
sv standard of conduct, to be followed In fu
ture; a standard such as that set by our great
naval commanders like Paul Jones. Decatur
Perry, Farragut, the Porters and others. A
sense of propriety forbids my mentioning the
living."
With the conclusion of Captain Lemly's re
marks the court at 3:4.' p. m. adjourned with
the Intention of holding no more public ses
sions.
REVIEW OF THE SCHXEY CASE
Acts of the Admiral Are Justified by
the* Testimony Introduced.
The Sehley inquiry Is practically over, as
DB. PIEHCE'S REMEDIES.
FRIGHTENED!
The Agony Endured by
Nervous Women.
"My nerves are all unstrung" is the
expressive way iv which a woman is
apt to describe a condition of extreme
nervousness. The figurative expression
"unstrung" may be unscientific but it
pathetically suggests the grand harp of
the nervous system, strung and keyed
for harmonies by its Maker, now become
so unstrug that it gives out nothing but
jarring discords. Nervous people rarely
receive the sympathy which is their due.
The dropping of a book which causes
the nervotis woman to start, or the slam-
ming of a door which causes her to
scream, are sounds which do not jar the
..
nerves of a healthy person. To
;he nervous woman such sud-
ien sounds are like a blow in
r .he face and they cause intense
suffering. The extent of this
suffering may be gathered from Mrs.
Nelson' s experience told in the letter
below. SlVe says, " / was so nerv-
ous that the least thing would startle me
almost into convulsions." Such a con-
dition of nervousness generally indicates
womanly diseases. It is useless to at-
tempt to cure nervousness by the use of
narcotics.
NARCOTICS ARE DEADLY
for the nervous woman -whose need is
not to make the nerves sle<;p but to
make them strong, not to numb them
but to nourish them. The best medi-
cine for nervous women is Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription. It cures nervous-
ness because it cures the causes which
are behind nervousness. It establishes
regularity, dries the drains which under-
mine the health and strength, heals
inflammation and ulceration and cures
female weakness. It makes weak women
strong and sick women well.
"Dr. Pierces medicines are the best I
have ever used," writes Mrs. C. Nelson,
of Chemawa, Marion Co., Oregon. <*My
health was badly run down when I con-
sulted him by letter. My limbs were
cold and my head hurt me continually.
I was so nervous that the least thing
would startle me almost into convul-
sions. I had palpitation of the heart so
bad that I could scarcely walk some-
times. I feU utterly discouraged, but
two bottles of Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription and one of ' Golden Medical
Discovery ' made a new woman out of
me. We are never without Dr. Pierces
Pellets in the house. "
Nothing is claimed for Dr. THerce's
Favorite Prescription but is claimed for
it by the women who have been cured
by its use. Behind every claim is a
cure â yes, a thousand cures. In fact,
far as its stated purposes are concerned. The
facts have been brought to light.
The case is now with the court, and in due
time its finding will be formally and officially
rendered. '
Confident in the capacity, intelligence and
uprightness of the three experienced, war-tried
I veterans who compose that court, and follow
ing the details of the testimony us it has been
elicited from day to day, 98 per cent of the
people of these United States and 99 per cent
of the reputable press of the country have,
already discounted the verdict.
â¢> Schley to-day stands on a higher pedestal
of public favor and admiration than he ever
could have hoped to do without the ordeal to
which he has been subjected.
Verily persecution brings its rewards.
Â¦ He Is to-day the most thoroughly vindicated
man that ever faced a military or naval court.
As his thundering guns shook the echoes of
the overlooking Cuban shores and hurled dis
aster and death upon the most trusted stay
of the proud Spaniards' power in the West,
even so surely did the irresistible force of the
truth, for the first time fully unfolded, carry
discomfiture and defeat to the combination that
has sought to rob him of his well-earned laurels
and degrade him in the eyes of his country
men.
Insult to His Career.
From under the cloud of doubt and discredit
engendered primarily by a most unmanly and
unprofessional jealousy, and then intensified
by a systematic and persistent course of ma
licious impugning of character and motive,
suppression of facts and fabrication of word
and Incident, -by which it has been sought to
dim 'he crowning glory of his long and hon
orable career, Schley' s fame to-day stands
forth In clearer figure and more resplendent
than before, the bright light of truth and pub
licity shining full upon it.
And with it come forth the names of the
brave and loyal Cook 'of the Brooklyn. Schley' a
flag captain, the noble and gallant Clark of the
Oregon and the other officers and the crews
of the two ships that made the victory so com
plete that there was "enough glory for all" â
names which, - from the modesty of the owners
on the one hand and the obscuration incident
to official' reports made by a non-participant
In . and non-observer of Â» the fighting on the
other, have been allowed to lack much of the
honor and luster now proved to be their Just
right and due.
â¢ Others," too, have finally met Just recognition
of service and deed, loyally and bravely per
formed throughout the campaign.

to sight In the magnitude of the consequences
of 'malicious lying affronts to history. Nobody

" I would like to express my gratitude

WHAT WOMEN DRBAD.
There is a sentence in
Mrs. Anderson's letter
which will strike a sym-
pathetic chord in the breast
of every woman. She
writes of Â¦ Favorite Pre-
scription."
* It is a God-send to weak
and sickly women, restor-
good health without sub-
jecting their weak nerves
to the shock of an examina-
tion .1
Women dread the in-
delicate questionings, the
offensive examinations and
the obnoxious local treat-
ment considered necessary
by many local physicians.
All these may generally be
avoided by a consultation
by letter with Dr. Pierce,
for which there is abso-
lutely no charge. Sick and
ailing women are invited to consult Dr.
Pierce, by letter, free. All correspond-
ence is strictly private and the written
confidences of women are treated with
the same privacy observed by Dr. Pierce
in verbal consultations with women at
the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Insti-
tute, Buffalo, N. Y. Address Dr. R. V.
Pierce, Buffalo, N. T.
Because Dr. Pierce'a offer is free it is
not be classed with those offers of n free
medical advice" made by men or women
who hay% neither the legal nor the pro-
fessional right to practice medicine. If
they dared to put out their signs with
the title Doctor upon them, the law would
instantly deal with them. They don't
dare to do this, and yet, though without
medical training, medical knowledge or
medical experience, they cunningly offer
"free medical advice." The law can't
touch that claim because anyone can
give free advice on any subject, but a
woman knows that the advice of her
laundress is perfectly worthless as to
the cutting and fitting of her gown.
In consulting with Dr. Pierce, women
not only consult with a real doctor, but
one who is a specialist in the treatment
and cure of diseases peculiar to women,
and who, assisted by his staff of nearly a
score of physicians, has in a little more
than thirty years treated and cured hun-
dreds of thousands of women.

but it was not the cry of the "craven and
caitiff" of the traducer Maclay's conjuration;
it was the grateful recognition of the bravo
and prudent commander, who, maintaining his
advanced and all-important position ami fight
ing three times his own strength, welcomed
the assistance of the mighty ship which made
victory certain with a minimum loss to his
own side.
It was abundantly proved that 70 per cent of
the hits made by the Spaniards struck thÂ«
Brooklyn and at the same time she inflicted
far greater damage to them than all the Amer
ican ships together except the Oregon. Allow
ing her her pro rata of hits from the 8-inch
and t>-pourider shells which were thrown by
other vessels also, she has full- credit for
eighteen' hits with 5-inch shells, which she
alone carried, four of which struck thÂ« Teresa,
six the Oquendo, five the Viscaya and three
the Colon, which with three 6-pounders were
all the strikes made on the latter vessel.
Three hours and three-quarters of fierce fight
ing, "the Oregon and Brooklyn were sheets of
flame." And how bore 9chlÂ»y himself? "En
thusiastically brave and patriotic." says the
gallant Cook, who was at his side throughout
the fight.
The evidence adduced before the court %as
made clear the significance of many things not
before generally known or well understood, . A
few of these may be briefly noticed. I
Appearance of Sampson.
The echo of the lee gun fired by the Colon
In token of surrender had long died away be
fore the funnels of the New York bearing the
belated commander in chief appeared above the
eastern horizon.
With him came a quench to the exuberant
Joy natural to the winners in such a race. :
His first step was to intercept the Brook
lyn's boat, which had already boarded the
prize, and was returning to report to Schley
and to take the further dispositions ' into ' hid
own hands. Next to remove Schley and Clark
from the scene of their triumph by sending the
Brooklyn -and Oregon In search of a Spanish
vessel reported to be approaching the mouth
of Santiago harbor, and this when a signal to
the lowa, Indiana and Texas, many miles
rearer to the suspect, would have given them
a lead of an hour in the work.
Then came the handing back his report of
the battle to Schley on the ground that "an
Important fact" had been omitted. "The pres
ence of the New York" was not mentioned.
Sampson had been jumped several numbers
over the heads of Schley and other deserving
officers to make him the commander in chief.
Yet Schley's first act on joining him with the
flying squadron at Key West, after saluting his
flag, was to hasten aboard the flagship, pay his
respects and assure Sampson of his loyalty and
ready co-operation in all his plans. â¢ â¢â¢ - .
The killing contrast between the magnanim
ity of the one officer and the small-mindedness
of the other must have struck the court most
forcibly. '
Detrimental Testimony. '
If there was any failure to gather and bring
out every item of testimony detrimental ' to
Schley it was not the fault of the Navy De
partment. A good part of Its personnel -Â»mi
all of Its resources were devoted to that end. Â¦
Secretary Long had already long before al
lowed himself to be involved by Crownlnshleld
In devious ways for glorifying Sampson and de
grading Schley: had written an official lettif
to the Senate to that end and was Â¦ bound to
Justify himself in the premises. â¢ .â¢â¢ , .
By his sanction and under the direction of
Crownlnshield emissaries were sent to ' every '
navy-yard and to every vessel in the service to
search out and sound those who had any knowl
edge of facts bearing on the case.
One Ward, a protege of Crownlnshleld's and.
an attache of the Bureau of Navigation, and

INDULGE ONLY IN SIGNAL PRACTICE
Supporters of the Elevens Show Confidence in Their Repre
sentatives, Although a Close, Hard-Fought Contest Is
Expected When They Clash To-Morrow on the Field
DR. SIMPSON, HEAD FOOTBALL COACH OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, AND HIS SQUAD OF SUBSTI
TUTES. THESE WILL BE IN EVIDENCE ON THE SIDE LINE TO-MORROW-NOT WISHING THAT ANY
ONE BE DISABLED, BUT STILL CONSUMED WITH DESIRE TO GET INTO THE GAME.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 7.
âAfter the rooting at the last foot
ball practice yesterday afternoon
and the enthusiasm displayed at
the final really last night affairs
at the university have reassumed their
normal condition.
Every one. it is true, is talking football
and Stanford's chances on Saturday, but
it is all done with a quiet feeling of con
fidence. Confidence seem? in the airâ the
rooters, the coaches and to a certain de
gree the team are confident of a cardinal
victory on Saturday. However, no one
will predict a large score, for a close,
hard-fought contest is expected.
The varsity and all the substitutes spent
ar. hour on the gridiron to-night running
through signals, punting and place-kick
ing. The men showed well in the signal
practice, scarcely hesitating a moment on
any play, although Quarterback Raitt put
them through all manner of formations.
Hill is punting well, but Traeger failed
repeatedly in his attempts at field goals
to-night. The big fellow is generally
sure at place-kicking and it is hoped he
will be in good form again by Saturday.
Coach Fickert announced to-night that
he would take thirty men to the game,
which means that nineteen "subs" will be
SALMON CROWD
RIVER WATERS
Extraordinary Run of
the Fish in Northern
California.
Specia.l Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING. Nov. 7.â The State is not
liable to suffer a salmon famine during
the present season. From October 1C until
after November 15 these palatable fish
can be caught only in tide water. The
flih have passed up the San Joaquin and
Sacramento rivers and the expert river
fishermen close to the bay find It not
worth while to seine so the State is really
kdependent upon Humboldt Bay and the
wide Wtoter portion of the rivers which
flow Into it for the salmon supply.
The run of salmon in Eel River this sea
sor. promises to be larger than for any
one of several seasons in the past. The
river as far as tide water extends ts
alive with tish. Schools of salmon trout
that would swamp a boat on the riffles
are going up stream and some of the
finest salmon ever caught are being taken
near the site of the old salmon cannery.
There are some good reasons to believe
that under present conditions the salmon
production in Eel River will steadily in
crease. The Statf- fish hatchery at Price
Creek has lot loose millions of small sal
mon in Eel River and they are just be
ginning to show up when the salmon re
turn from the ocean. This year 1,000,000
more will be hatched and possibly sev
eral millions will be turned into the
stream. Those will go to sea to return in
three years and enlarge the output of
salmon.
But the hatchery is not the only bene
factor. The iaw which makes a close sea
son during the salmon run from sunrise
on Saturday to sundown on Sunday dur
ing which time no salmon are to be taken
Â«lth ret or seine is one of the causes oi
better supply. The fishermen are now at
the height of their season.

rooters will go en masse to the Grand

The fact that a large gathering of rooters

ALTROCK PITCHES
A CLEVER CAME
He Strikes Out Nine of
Uncle Henry's Men
Easily.
Pennant Winners Fail to
Send a Man Home in
"the Game.
"Nick" Altrock, the Los Angeles
pitcher, combined with the cold weather,
proved too much for Uncle Henry Har
ris 1 team of pennant winners yesterday
at Recreation Park. They failed to score,
while Los Angeles sent six men scurry
ing around the bases. Altrock, the Ca
nadian, struck out nine men, including
some of the surest batters in the league.
They all looked alike to the blonde twirler.
Los Angeles sent Altrock home in the
third for its first run. He singled, went
to second on Hemphlll's single and third
on Dougherty's safe hit. He scored on a
throw to second to catch Dougherty,
which Krug missed. The side was retired
before any more runs were scored.
In the seventh the Angels scored five
runs on four hits, assisted by several erv
rors by Krug. Reitz singled and Kihm
was hit by the pitcher. Hall sacrificed,
advancing the men to second and third.
Rellly came with a timely two-bagger,
scoring Reitz and Kihm. Spies made a
scratch hit just inside the foul line over
third base, which scored Reilly and left
Spies on second. Altrock singled to Krug;
who made a bad pick up and then a worse
throw to first, on which Altrock went tc
Becond. Spies scored on this and Altrock
scored his second run on Hemphill's hit.
Hemphill was caught out stealing home.
This was the last of the scoring.
In the fifth it seemed the Wasps would
sur.ely score. Krug was first man up and
singled. Shay walked and Reilly sacri
ficed, advancing the men to second and
third. Iburg struck out and Nordyke re
tired the side by going out at first.
In the ninth the Wasps had the bases
full. Pabst singled; Krug followed with
a two-bagger. Shay and Reilly flew out
and Graham was given a pass. Nordyke
ended tke agony by flying out.
Krug's four errors and Altrock's slever
pitching were the features of the game,
although they must be taken from a dif
ferent point of view. The attendance was
good. The score:

HOT AIR THE MEANS
TO TVTATCT! WELLS FLOW
BAKERSFIELT>, Nov. 7â J. W. Goff of
San Diego has discovered a scheme for
forcing oil wells to flow which will be
of interest to producers in the Kern river
and outside fields. Considerable difficulty
has been experienced In producing flow
ing wells on property on the south side
of the Kern.
Everything possible was done to make
the wells flpw, but no success was met
with untiV Goff forced hot air and steam
from the. toiler of the engine to the bot
tom of the" well. As soon as the oil be
came heated, gases were evidently
formed and the well commenced to flow
and has flowed continuously for the last
week. By means of hot air the wells
can be made to flow, it is said, at a
lesser depth than the wells have formerly
been drilled.
Police Arrest Suspicious Persons.
LOS ANGELES* Nov. 7.â The police
have arrested twenty-two suspicious
characters, believed to belong to a gang
of crooks who are thought to have come
here from San Francisco a few days ago.
One of the suspects carried a full kit of
skeleton keys secreted ln his clothing and
others of the gang are suspected of the
numerous robberies that have occurred in
this city recently. They will be held until
their records are investigated.
Broken Wheel Causes Train Wreck.

on the main line of the Northern Pacific
one mile, north of Fort Harrison to-day
eighteen cars of a special south bound

mass of debris and the track torn up for
several hundred feet. The wreck was
caused by a broken wheel. Two of the
train crew were seriously Injured.
RING AT OAKLAND TRACK IS HARD HIT
OVER THE VICTORY OF FIVE FAVORITES
Bedeck Disposes of John McGurk Without Ruffling a Hair.
O'Connor and Woods Divide the Saddle Honors, Each
Piloting Two Winnersâ Bonnie Lissak Finally Lands
BOTH the field books and the books
of the big ring at Oakland race
track were kept busy cashing
pasteboards yesterday. Five fa
vorites and a second choice
crossing the line first caused all of the
woe. Both Johnny Woods and O'Connor
have a large following, and as each rode
a brace of winners this fact did not con
tribute to dispelling the gloom of the
layers of odds. Although the weather
was inclined to be sharp and bracing and
the card was several degrees from stake
form the attendance was large.
Twelve maiden two-year-olds in a four
and a half furlong scramble furnished thÂ«
first betting proposition. The coin went
in on Sandy McNaughton's Montoya, and
with Woods up the Amigo youngster led
from the start, beating Flattered and The
Maniac easily, i
McNaughton followed this by getting
the coin with Saul of Tarsas in the six
furlong run. Saul had O'Connor up in
place of Ruiz, and, more vigorously rid
den this time, beat King Dellis out a
neck. Midnight Chimes cut out the run
ning in company with King Dellis, but
tired toward the close, finishing fourtn.
The winner ruled a mild favorite in ttie
betting.
Several good things received support in
the betting on the second maiden two
year-old spin. After everything became
settled Redan closed a slight choice over
Malaspina. At one time it looked as iÂ£
Ransch astride the latter filly would
make a runaway race of it, but Vittatoe
brought Redan along in time to win by
a half-length. El Chihuahua ran third.
Undoubtedly the class, Bedeck had an
easy time "subduing his company in the
mile and a sixteenth selling affair. A 3
to 5 choice, O'Connor never made a move
to the stretch, and then the Morris entry
rolled in. Hoar busied himself working
on John McGurk, but the best he could
do was to beat Rushficids ten lengths for
the place.
Essence, from the Burns & Waterhouse
stable, earned a very close decision over
Fine Shot at the close of the six-furlong
selling dash, which came next for deci
sion. The last named sprinter, wit.'i
Birkenruth in the pilot house, jumped
away in front, but stopped a trifle under
the high pressure and lost the verdict by
a nose. O'Connor on Princess Titania put
in a full day's work without results, for
the filly, an even money shot, was downed
for the show by Censor.
Ezell & Lazarus' mare Bonnie Lissak
came in for first call ln the betting op
the final mile and seventy yard race.
She stood a prolonged drive, overhaul
ing El Orlente and Billy Moore and dis
posing finally of the latter by a half
length.
Track Notes.
Virginia Carroll, the widely known
bookmaker, was expected in last night.
Virginia not many weeks ago had a very
exciting experience on one of the Chicago
tracks, and it is said has now concluded
to chalk up the odds without resorting
to repartee.
Walter Jennings, with a big stable of
horses, arrived at Oakland yesterday
from Sacramento.
Frank Lanterman, one of the high roll
ers of the Western booking brigade, was
a spectator yesterday. He may take a
hand in the game soon.
Fridolin was backed down ln the bet
ting from 20 to 7, and only for being cut
off on the far turn by Midnight Chimes
would have won.

WESTERN UNION
MUST COMPETE
Secretary Root Defines
Rights of Telegraph
Lines in Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Nov. 7.â Secretary of
War Root has denied the claim of the
Western Union Telegraph Company that
under its concession from Spain it pos
sesses the exclusive right to transmit pri
vate messages between the United States
and Cuba. The Secretary has also de
nied that the rights of the Cuba Sub
marine Telegraph Company, under the
Spanish grant, must be observed, and he
has directed Governor General Wood to
take measures to ascertain and maintain
the status quo ante bellum in respect to
private telegrams.
Under this instruction the transmission
of private messages between Havana.
Batabano, Cienfuegos and Santiago over
the Government lines, which has hereto
fore been allowed, will be prohibited. All
private business between these points
must be handled by the Cuba Submarine
Cable Company. It will be possible, how
ever, for the Government lines to receive
private messages for transmission from
Havana to Matanzas or any other point
not named in the concession of the Cuba
Submarine Cable Company.
The controversy over the telegraph busi
ness of Cuba has involved the Western
Union Telegraph Company, the Interna
tional Ocean Telegraph Company, the
French Cable Company and the Cuba
Submarine Telegraph Company. The
Western Union and International Ocean
Telegraph companies sought to prevent
any other telegraph companies from doing
business in Cuba.
The French company, it has been estab
lished, has the right to operate its cable
between Hayti and Santiago, Cuba, ami
to transmit by it messages received from
any part of the world. An examination of
the concession of the Cuba Submarine
Company and the decree issued by die
Spanish Government, which was discov
ered by the department after an exhaus
tive search, shows that the company pos
sesses the exclusive privilege of tele
graphic communication between any two
of these points in Cuba: Havana, Bata
bano Cienfuegos and Santiago.
This exclusive privilege is confined to
private messages and not to Government
business. The Spanish Government re
tained the right to operate land lines be
tween any one Of these points and all
other portions of the Island, but could not
transmit private messages between any
two of them.
The Government lines, which were re
constructed by the American army, con
nect these four points and have been used
by various cable companies for the send
ing of messages to the cities named.
JUDGE ADVOCATE LEMLY.
Continued From PagÂ© Seven.
Ward did Us best to suppress, was indicative
of a. thinking on the part of the court that was
of little credit to Ward and his accomplices.
Some four-score witnesses were called, about
one-third of that number for Schley. They were
of all grades, kinds and conditions of life as
well as mental Impulsion.
.Some could see good and right In some things
that Schley did or did not do. Others could
see nothing good or creditable In anything that
he did or did not do.
gome who fought on the same ship with
Schley marked him as a "brave, confident com
mander whose example was inspiring to offi
cers and men." Others like the impossible
Potts, whose tender y^ars and brief experience
muet apologize for him, mistook th,e "gaudlum
certamlniH of the old veteran" for nervousness
and classed Schley with the cowards.
Some of the witnesses for the prosecution
made admissions of dereliction of dtity to their
commander bo flagrantly disloyal to him and
the end for which all were supposed to be
striving as to lay the foundation for trial on
the charge of treasonable neglect of duty
against themselves.
The precept was so drawn that it could be
used as a dragnet for any and every
thing of fault either of omission or com
mission on Schley's part, but with it all
not one BDeclflcatton of the ten-pieced pre
cept was austalned to the point of reflecting
on Schley' b conduct or judgment, and every
one that implied an Imputation on his char
acter as an officer was effectually disproved.
Prosecution. Fails.
The case for the prosecution was broken
down by Its own witnesses before half of them
had been called to the stand.
The whole affair smelled bo unsavory and
reflected so strongly on the method and men
who were responsible for the injustice and out
rage done to the gallant veteran that the Judge
advocate felt obliged to apologize for his con
nection with It and his bearing during its con
tinuance.
Admiral Schley graduated from the naval
academy in 1860. He taw almost continual
fighting service throughout the war with the
blockading squadron off Charleston, with Far
ragut and Tortel on the gulf and* in the Mis
sissippi. Then later against the revolted
coolies on the Chincha Islands.
Schley's Long Record.
Admiral Schley has a long record of active
and honorable service with Farragut, Dupont
and Porter during the civil war, in South
America, following the brave McKee over the
ramparts of the Korean fort in 1871 and aveng
ing his death. Pushing to the rescue of the
Greely party In 1884 and at Valparaiso In
1891, always and everywhere doing ail that
should be done and little that should not be
done.
He achieved the crowning glory of hi# own
career and one of the largest and most im
portant victories* in the history of the Ameri
can navy at Santiago on July 3, 1898. and
neither the court of inquiry nor the American
people will suffer him to be despoiled thereof
by any te^nlcalltles or by hook or orook.
This court* of inquiry is not the first that
"ias concerned Admiral Schley, for his baptis
mal names were given in memory of Just such
another held In Frederick, Md., his native
town some two yeÂ«rs before he wae born.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1901.
CHAMPION JAMES J. JEFFRIES' FIGHTING FACE AND PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIES OF THE MUSCLES HE
HAS DEVELOPED IN HIS SEVERE COURSE OF TRAINING AT HARBIN SPRINGS FOR HIS FORTHCOM
ING MEETING WITH RUHLIN, IN WHICH HE WILL DEFEND HIS CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE.
CHAMPION WILL REACH OAKLAND TO-NIGHT
UNLESS HE AGAIN CHANGES HIS PLANS
HARBIN SPRINGS, Nov. 7.âJef
fries labored yesterday morning
in a vain effort to remove the
hillside close to his handball
court. With pick and shovel he
tolled until the perspiration streamed
from him and his hands were blistered.
For more than two hours the champion
exercised himself with this new diversion
In training. Friends watching Jim work
thought he was digging for lost treasure.
Jeff took chaffing good naturedly.
"When yer locate the boodle, Jeff, count
me in," said Armstrong.
Billy Delaney is considered a learned
man, and he enlightened the watching
crowd. He said the champion was looking
for pre-historic relics and unbluÃhingly as
serted that many years before Harbin
Springs was discovered by Proprietor
Hayes the place was inhabited by giants,
who used to play penuchle for high stakes.
That one of these left a diagram, in an
old tin can, which showed? he had buried
his winnings deep in the earth. Jeffries,
he said, had found the can and was try-
Ing to unearth the treasure. Some one in
the crowd was uncharitable enough to in
sinuate that Delaney was a stranger to
truth, so Billy quit lecturing.
Jeff said he benefited his arms by doing
this kind of work and as no one desired
to follow his example he was not further
disturbed. The man who was hired to
remove the hill calmly lit his pipe and
sat in the shade, while the champion
tolled. When Jeff decided he had enough
the laborer Invited him to return to-mor
row, as there would be enough hill left
for him to again exercise his great
strength.
In the afternoon the champion an
nounced he was going to take a stroj*
over the hills. A new arrival at the
Springs noticed no one said he would ac
company the champion, so he volunteered.
Jeff said he would be glad to have him
come. The training crew winked know
ingly as they watched the pair depart.
About three nours later Jeffries returned.
He was asked by the young man's friends
where he had left him. Jim replied that
he was resting on the road two or three
miles back. About dusk the volunteer
crawled into camp, footsore and weary.
He managed to enter a hot bath and af
ter being rubbed down felt in condition
to talk.
"Say, that big fellow must have muscles
of steel," he said. "Why, I kept up witlt
him for the first five miles, but when he
started to run 1 became disheartened. Ha.
must be in superb condition to go such
a pace."
When Jeffries returned from his hard
run he was not distressed. As soon as he
had received a dry rubdown he put on
his gymnasium suit and romped down tv
was summoned home from hlÂ« victorious cam
paign in Florida against the Semlnoles to
answer before a court of inquiry called at the
Instance of Generals Galnes and Jessup.
These two officers Insisted that the hero of
Chlppewa made "a loop" of some kind in the
preeence of the savages of the Withlocoochee,
and that, although by a mere accident, they
themselves were not immediately present when
the battle was fought the behavior of the com
mander who was there was not what It should
have been.
Bcott triumphed over his enemies In the
court as he did over the savages In the field,
and Schley's father, whose 'sympathies were
all aroused at the outrage sought to be per
petrated on the great Virginian, called his next
boy after him, Winfleld Scott Bchley.
When asked if he had anything to say In
his own behalf. General Scott told the story
of the Doge of "Venice who was summoned to
the court of Louis XIV to answer for some
imaginary offense, and said that like him he
would say that to find himself before the court
filled him with equal grief and astonishment
Admiral Schley might do well to say the same
His Condition Is Pronounced
as Good as the Hands of

Ruhlin Decides to Devote
Alternate Days to Work on
Roads and in Gymnasium
the handball court He skipped the rope
a couple of thousand times and whistled
a tune during the exercise. He put in ail
kinds of fancy uteps, and his jumping was
enjoyed by the "onlookers. He then took
to the rowing machine. This is his pet
exercise. He says it strengthens arms
and Bhoulders and develops his wind. He
gears the machine so high that only a
man of his great strength can move the
oars. He kept this work up for ten min
utes, and when he finished was ready for
more work. He then toyed with the med
icine ball. This weighs about twenty
pounds, but the big fellow handles it with
ease. Brother Jack bore the brunt of the
attack, and Jeffries nearly knocked him

About 9 o'clock in the evening Jeffries
and his friends went on a coon hunt.
"Syndicate" Armstrong was prevailed
upon to give up a poker game and went
along. Every dog in camp was pressei
into service. Within a few minutes their
deep baying signaled they were on the
track of a coon. Jeffries carried the lan
tern and led the crowd in the wake of the
dogs. The pace was a hot one, and tha
bunch either had to keep it up or sit down
in the darkness until the champion re
turned. The hunters returned about mid
night with one coon.
Trainer Delaney believes that when Jef
fries goes down to the city his wind will
be better than it is up here. Harbin
Springs is nearly 2000 feet above the levÂ»l
of the sea, and of necessity the air iÂ«
lighter than in San Francisco. Delaney'*
theory is that if Jeffriea can run five
miles without being winded In this at
mosphere he must be able to go double
the distance in the city.
Preparations to leave for Oakland are
under way. If Jeffries does not change
his mind at the eleventh hour the entire
party will depart for Oakland to-morrow
morning. Jim will finish his training ac
the Reliance Athletic Club. Delaney wl'l
keep a close watch on Jim and see that
he Is not bothered by advico and idls
spectators.
thing:. To find himself, after a most active
career of forty-one years, honorable and glori
ous throughout, before a court of Inquiry on
charges Involving cowardice In the presence of
the enemy, anlmputatlon above all others hated
by a naval officer. All, too, as a direct fol
lowing of one of the most signal and glorious
victories .ever achieved under the American
flag and gained under his immediate direction
and by bis most gallant and efficient participa
tion, may well fill him with grief and aston
ishment.
Naval history Bhpws no parallel to these pro
ceedings.
In 1757 the English Admiral Byng was tried
and convicted on technicalities for failure to
ralleve Minorca, which was being besieged by
a French fleet, and though recommended to
mercy was allowed by the brutal obstinacy
of George II to be shot to death on his own
quarter deck by a file of marines.
For allowing himself to be defeated at Tra
falgar the French Admiral Villeneuve was
court-martialed and disgraced by the orders
of Napoleon. The Italian Admiral Persano,
whose fleet was defeated at Lisas. OS6HJ hv om
QUS RUHLJN Is satisfied he has
reached the highest notch of
physical condition. From this
t^me forward until the big fight
he will reduce his work gradually.
Ruhlin and his manager, Billy Madden,
had a consultation yesterday, and as a
result Ruhlin's usual afternoon gymna
sium work was omitted. Instead of going
through the rope skipping, bag punching
and wrestling, Ruhlin dressed himself
lightly and went for a ten-mile walk with
Tom Herman, who is training to fight
Kid McFadden. Herman ran a great deal
of the distance, but Ruhlin simply Jogged
along at a brisk gait.
The tapering off process will be a tick
lish proposition, when a man is In the
pink of condition to battle for the heavy
weight championship of the world great
care must be taken that he does not go
stale, "leave his fight on the road," nor
meet with some accident to his legs, arms
or hands. Madden intends to be especial
ly careful with his aspirant for Jeff's
laurels. Henceforth he will keep a watch
ful eye on him. It was upon the advice
of Madden that Ruhlin decided to com
mence to ease off in his training yester
day.
For the last three weeks Ruhlin.
only had the boxing gloves on twice. The
first knuckle of Ratlin's left hand, which
was injured some time ago, is thoroughly
healed and mended and Is as good as It
ever was. Ruhlin, however, will take no
chances of its causing him any Inconven
ience, so he will leave the gloves alone
until the night of the fight and be careful
not to engage in any exercise which
might present an opportunity to bruise
the member.
On alternate days from now until the
night of the big fight Ruhlin will do his
afternoon work in the gymnasium. On
other 'afternoons the Akron fighter will
simply seek diversion and recreation in
long walks. Ruhlin has been thraug-h this
tapering on* process before and he knows
Just what to do. When he feels like a
boy with a new toy Gus will scramble
and shuffle around the gymnasium with
dumbbells and wrestle and jostle about
the big swinging bag which he uses as a
substitute for a punching bag. At times
he will probably feel dull, and on these
occasions Billy Madden will manage to
get up diversion of some sort to dispel the
spirit. A boxer training in one place for
over two months is liable to grow stale.
It is wonderful that Ruhlin has not up
to this time showed the slightest inclina
tion to develop staleness. There may be
one more test of his condition and after
that Ruhlin will enjoy a season of abso
lute rest until he enters the ring.

prearranged plan of battle, - and refusing to
obey the orders signaled by hlÂ» commander-ln

English fleet attacked and defeated the superior

could come up. How was he treated. Sir John
Jervls boarded Nelson's ship and with tears
of joy and admiration running down his cheeks,
embracing and kissing his disobedient but vic

the victory; the King made him Lord Nelson
and the English people all but deified him.

employed by outsiders, and Brown being
a member of neither could not get men
to work for him.

FAST VOYAGE HADE " i :
BY A BRITISH BARK
Sierra Blanca Reaches San Diego
From London in Remarkably
Quick Time.
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 7.â After the quick
est trip that has been made from London
to this port for many years, the British
bark Sierra Blanca, Captain J. E. Cork
hill, dropped anchor in the stream to-day,
just 132 days from the time she cast off
the tug's tow line off Beachy Head on the
27th of last June. She brings a cargo of
2125 tons of English cement for Spreckels
Brothers' Commercial Company and will
begin discharging as soon as 3he can be
given the Spreckels wharf, which is now
occupied by the German ship Siam, dis
charging cement and fertilizing salts from
Hamburg.
Captain Corkhill will be well remem
bered in San Francisco, as he was quite
a regular caller there during the past few
year 3 while captain of the British four
masted ship Crown of India. He had fre
quently taken cargoes out of San Fran
cisco for the I'nited Kingdom and in his
last trip to the coast his ship was in
collision in San Francisco Bay with the
revenue cutter Richard Rush.

WOMEN OBJECT
TO MORMONISM
Members of Societies in
Japan Prepare a %
Protest.
TACOMA, Nov 7.â The women of Japan
hav.e now added their protest to that of
the religious denominations against per
mitting Heber Grant and his associates
of Salt Lake to promulgate the Mormon
creed in the Mikado's realm.
The Imperial Government has been pe
titioned by three of the most important
societies of women of Japan on this sub
ject. The primary object of these socle
ties is to reform customs with regard to
women. They are working to raise Jap
anese women to a higher plane, especial
ly with regard to their morality. They
set forth four reasons why Mormons
should not be allowed to proselyte among
Japanese. They are as follows:
Firstâ While the Mormons publicly an
nounce their abandonment of plural mar
riages they are guided only by political
considerations and continue to practice
polygamy.
Second â That Mormons hold that the
end justifies the means and the his
tory of Mormon propagandism is disfig
ured by shocking deeds.
Thirdâ That the Mormon organization is
subsersive of submission to legally con
stituted authority, having at the heal
prophets and elders whose commands all
members must obey.
Fourth â They desire to remove to Utah
all proselytes Â¦wrtio cannot yield unquali
fied obedience in the country where they
live.
The women add that while the authori
ties are endeavoring to control evil aaeta
at home they should certainly refuse ad
mission to an undesirable sect from
abroad.
Identify Remains of a Suicide.
STOCKTON. Nov. 7.â The remains of
the man found dead In bed last night

suicide by taking strychnine, were iden
tified this morning a3 those of Tom Chris
tian, an old engineer. He leaves a di
vorced wife and two children in Virginia
City, Nev., where he lived years ago. It
is believed the cause of his act was de
spondency brought on by heavy drinking.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 7.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser* a financial cablegram from London
says: The stock market to-day was merely
steady, save the American department, which
was strongly bulled by insiders, though the
public was still apathetic. Yesterday's in
terest in Union Pacific spread throughout the
list to-day, the favorites being Atchlson, Ches
apeake and Ohio, Ontario and Western, United
States Steel and Southern Railway. .There
were heavy operations in the last named stock,
which closed at 37%, or less than a point under
the best price of the year. Southern Pacific
and Erie hung fire till New York purchases
in the afternoon caused a general close after
some profit-taking. Rio Tintos are talked of
at 60, owing to the continued American pur
chases and a big bear account in Paris.

record-breaking day, both as regards business
transactions and fluctuations in value. The
opening was steady in tone, with prices 10@15
points higher, the advance being due to cover
ing by frightened shorts on rumors of continued
drought in the Santos district and on very bull
ish European market advices. Speculative de
mand from the room contingent and outside
investment developed on a heavy scale follow
ing the call and prices advanced a further
s@lo points, with offerings scarce. At noon a
private cable from Brazil made its appearance
estimating the next Rio crop at 2.500,000 bags
and the Santos crop at 4,500,000 bags, a total
of 7.000,000 bags, whereas from ten to eleven
million bags had been expected. This cable
inspired the wildest covering by shorts and
heavy baying for all accounts, prices advanc
ing rapidly until a net rise of COJJ6S points
was recorded. A slight reaction on prollt
taklng occurred near the close, but final prices
were 55@60 points higher, with the tone steady.

CHICAGO, Nov. 7.â Lower cables had an
early depressing effect on wheat, but this was
soon overcome when It was found that hardly
any offerings were coming-, and those only
from a few shorts. December opened a shade
lower to a shade hisrher at 71%@72c, but felt
the effects of buying orders with the commis
sion houses and the strong tone in the corn
pit and began its upward Journey. All during
the session trade was nervous and active and
on a broader scale than that of either yester
day or the. day before. News favored buyers,
with the exception of the early cables. Cash
prices were strong and December sold up to
72% C closing strong at %c higher than yes
terday.
Last season's corn crop failure is beginning
to show stronirly on the corn market. Traders
who sold short yesterday hurried to cover to
day. December corn closed firm, %'B>%c higher,
At EWic*
Oats were strong and higher. The cash sit
uation was particularly strong. December
closed strong. IVic higher, at 35%0.
Provisions were steady, with fairly good
trading. Pork closed 10c up, lard unchanged
and ribs 2%c up.

VICIOUS YOUTH
WIELDS A KNIFE
Louis Cole Attempts to
Kill Secretary
White.
-? Â¦ Â¦
Accused by Stepfather of
Theft He Tries to Com
mit Murder.
Louis Cole, a wayward youth, made a
desperate attempt to murder Secretary
White of the California Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children last
night. Several days ago William Heath,
the boy's stepfather, reported to the so
ciety that- a number of articles, including
a historic drum that belonged to his un
cle, had disappeared from his home at 316
Twelfth street, and, as he strongly sus
pected the boy of having taken them, he
asked that he be arrested.
The matter was turned over to Secre
tary White, and last night he visited the
home of Mrs. Lynch, at 315 Twelfth street,
whore the lad was stopping. After be
ing questioned, the boy admitted his guilt
and, going to the basement of the house,
he returned in a few minutes with most
of the stolen articles. When asked about
some plumbing tools, young Cole became
surly, and, picking up a carving Knife,
which was on the kitchen table, made
a lunge at White.
The surprised secretary, fortunately for
himself, avoided the knife by jumping to
one side, and, seizing a baby's chair, he
held it in front of him to protect his body
from further thrusts of the knife. Aa
the \icious youth continued to try to stab
"White, the latter forced him against the
wall with the aid of the chair, and, as
he again raised the weapon to strike a
fatal blow, the stepfather, who witnessed
the occurrence, grabbed the uplifted arm
and after a short struggle took the knite
from him.
The desperate youth was handcuffed. He
was then taken to the City Prison and
I booked for some public institution.
GUNMEN START
AFTER VICTIMS
Wong Family Refuses to
Accede to Demands
of the Chins.
?
The state of unrest which has pervaded
CHinatown for the last week was inten
sified at midnight 'last night when the
Chin family sent forth its gunmen to
spill the blood of ; five of the powerful
Wong family. That the highbinders will
do their work when the chance presents
itself admits of no doubht, because the
struggle is one for revenge, and the high
price set upon the head of each man
marked for "death offers more than an or
dinary allurement to the average Chinese
assassin.' ... ;' -' '/- -..,Â¦," '.
The time allotted to the Wong family
to surrender the murderer of Chin Chow
to the police expired at midnight. The
Wongs remained defiant an*'' when the
clock struck 12, instead of handing over
the much-wanted- man, they dispatched a
number of gunmen from , their., headquar
ters to slay more Chins and to continue
the struggle in the old 'fashion' that has
boon in vogue since history was first writ
ten of the Chinese.. ' ,- - ,
The murderer, Wong Chin, is supposed
to be in hiding in a house in the Western
Addition.: Detectives Gibson; McMahon
and Bailey spent all of .yesterday search
ing for. him anil last evening returned to
Chinatown, to prevent, if possible, the
threatened bloodshed. They searched the
heathens as they departed from the meet
ing place of each. tong. but were unable
to find any weapons. â
One of the marked . men. Wong Vow,
has secured a body guard of four men to
protect him from the highbinders. The
other men selected for. death have either
left the city or are secreted somewhere in
the Chinese quarter. - 'â¢ . -.-:

LABOR TROUBLE
INJURES NATION
Ex-President Cleveland
Deals With Causes
of Strife.
â Â¦ Â» i 'Â¦
Says Remedy Must Be Found
in Law of American
Co-operation.
PITTSBURG. Nov. 7.â The exercises of
Founder's day at Carnegie Institute,
which have come to be recognized as an
annual event of great Interest, not only
to the people of Plttsburg but to those of
other cities, were held In Music Hall this
afternoon. Seldom if ever before has the
occasion been so interesting and attended
by so many people. Long before the hour
set for commencing the exercises the ca
pacity of the hall was strained and the
doors had been closed, barring out at
least 2000 disappointed people who had
stood in line for a long time hoping to
gain admission. Aside from the natural
interest attaching to the opening of the
institute's winter session of art and mu-.
sic, the presence of Grover Cleveland as
orator of the day and of Mrs. Cleveland
as honorary guest served to augment the
desire of the people to participate in the
exercises. The entrance of Mrs. Cleveland
into ona of the boxes was the occasion
of hearty and prolonged applause. Hard
ly had this noise subsided when another
outburst heralded the presence of ex-
President Cleveland on the stage. The
vast audience received the distinguished
guest by rising and giving expression to
its pleasure by hanaclapping and waving
of handkerchiefs.
Happiness Is Not Found in Money.
Ex-President Cleveland spoke of "The
Obligations of National Copartnership."
saying in part:
The most serious and persistent evil that
disturbs co-operation p.monfc our people Is found
In the contentions ami quarrels between em
ployers and employe*. Surely as an original
proposition them should le no antagonism In
this country between labor end capital. On the
contrary the/ should be 'n close alliance and
friendship. Our institutions forbid that an ex
planation o' such antagonism should be found
in class jealousy and abuses. No American citi
zen was ever yet ccomed by birth to a life of
labor or poverty and fortunes are the product
of industry and intelligent endeavor. Labor
and capital touch and mingle so constantly and
naturally an.tng us that the laborer of to-day
is frequently the employer of labor to-morrow.
They should always supplement each other as
the warm rain supplements the fertile soil to
produce in jumt contribution an abundant store
of riches ot nature. Nor can the most con
suming desire for happiness excuse contentious
envy of capitalistic wealth, for it is beyond
reasonable dispute that the bulk of happiness
amoi k the American people Is found on a
plane of our social life tar below that occupied
\ y th* rich. The cares and enxleties ot the
occupation of money-getting and money-keep
ing and the strangling of genuine pleasure
which Is so often the result, certainly ought
not to excite the envy of the man who con
tentedly works wltn his hands and who, by
on irrepealable flat, may find In his work' the
v. ay Id real, simple, unperverted happiness.
White healthful and normal conditions of na
tional pnrtiniiship forbid envy and unfriendli
ness < n the part or the employed toward em
ploying capital, so also such conditions most
emphatically forbid the grinding selfishness,
the greedy rapacity and supercilious haughti
ness which too often characterize the treat
ment of the labor employed by capital.
Partnership Duties Are Violated,
I desire distinctly to disclaim any Intention
to suggest what may be the cause or causes of
the dislocation which unfortunately so fre
quently pecura in ilie relationship of labor to
capital. Whether it results from unreasonable
and Irritating dMHt'ntfi on the part of labor or
whether our wcrklngmen listen too credulously
to malign counsels, or whether again the trou
ble arises from the greed or avarice of capital
and r.f Its Immediate aggressions. 1 do not
l.reterui to s*y. Perhaps, all these have a chare
in creating t"i<- difficulty. But there is antag
â¢ misrr. in This relationship where there should
b-' a gracious unity of purpose. The situation
isflf proves that somewhere there are mem
bers of our partnership in American citizenship
who act In violation of partnership duties and
i am sure that I venture nothing In making
the assertion that the only remedy for this sit
uation must be found In a return to the ob
servances of the law of American co-operation
This return will not be accoinplUhed by nurs
ing real or linaÃinary injuries on the part of
labor, nor by lordly ami selfish arrogance on
the part of capital. A beginning must be made
by conspicuous examples of a recognition of
the duty and obligations which are the con
ditions upon which the full enjoyment of our
partnership advantages depends. These ex
amples should Inrtuce conservative and toler
ant counsels. They should be prominently
recognized and appreciated, and constantly
pressed upon the view or all who may be re
miss In their ob;lÃatii-ns to American co-opera
tloaâ Â¦vhatevt-r the scope and nature of these
obligations may be.
Unification of American Endeavor.
Such an example is seen In the establishment
and expansion ot the Carnegie Institute The
library, the museum of natural history ex
hibition of paintings, music, a schoolâ these
things constitute a monument more enduring
than brass. They commemorate not only a dis
, charge of the highest duty, but point the way
to the creation of such unification of American
jiiideavor as must develop the most patriotism
Those who lovo their country cannot do other
wise than fervently hope that the example here
exhibited may not only Incite others to do like
wise, but may accomplish its share toward dis
pelling misapprehension, distrust and sus
picion on the part ot any within Its Immediate
Influence who have allowed themselves to re
gard great wealth as Inevitably an unwhole
some element In our body politic.

POPE LEO RECEIVES
ENGLISH PILGRIMS
Visitors Present an Address Wishing
That He May Recover His
Temporal Power.
NEW YORK, Nov. 7â A Sun special
from Rome says: The f*ope to-day re
ceived a number of English pilgrims. His
appearance did not indicate that he was
suffering from any unusual infirmity. He
walked without aid, except that he used
a stick. In welcoming the pilgrims he
spoke extemporaneously, declaring that
he looked forward to the time when Eng
land would return to the Catholic faith
According to one report the Bishop of
Liverpool, in introducing the pilgrims
presented a written 'address, which was
not read because it reiterated the wish of
English Catholics that the Pope would
recover his temporal power. The recol
lections of the stir made some time ago
by the address of the Duke of Norfolk
induced the Vatican officials to keep to
day's address a secret.
Bazaar Attracts Crowd.
There was no falling off last night in

Bevier raise the debt from Memorial
Presbyterian Church. The ladies having
charge of the booths were kept busy in
disposing of the articles offered for Bale.
Recitations, songs and music tended to
make the evening's entertainment pleas
ant and acceptable to those who preferred
to rest after making the rounqs of the
hall and booths. The bazaar will clo-Â»o

The Â¦Â¦ ministers of - the , powers are per

The nrst letter received at. the foreign
fice came this morning from Mr. Conger,
United States Minister, saying that Sec
retary Hay had instructed, him to tender
the regrets of President Roosevelt and the
United States government at the Imminent
death of the Viceroy. .'.
The Chinese officials were unable to ob

cial treasurer and the generals command
ing the Chinese troops have sent ' a joint
telegram to various points recommending
Prince Ching to proceed and join the court
in order to present to the court the facts
of the situation in Peking before return
ing to the capital.
There are no signs of mourning In the
city, although the populace is v much ex
cited. The Ministers of the powers con
sider, Yuan Shi Kai the strongest man; in
China after Li -Hung Chang, and. 1 they
think .his . presence here would", have a
good influence on the court; but they fear
the results of removing him 'Â¦'Â¦ from the
province of Shantung, ; the most turbulent
province in the empire and the seat of the

recommendation of Chief Sullivan it was
decided to increase the following compa

CONSTANTINOPLE, Nov. 7.â The Porte
has yielded still further to the French
demands, and has notified M. Bapste,
counselor of the French embassy, that
authority is grunted France to rebuild or
repair sixteen churches, convents an']
other institutions situated in different
vitayets.
There is absolutely no foundation for
the report, which originated with the
Paris iiiciio de Paris, tnat the Porte had
demanded that Great Britain should pro
tect Asiatic Turkey from French attack.
ST. FETERSBUKG, Nov. 7.â The news
papers here anticipate that, following the
jead of France, other powers will discover
claims against Turkey. The Russian
newspapers generally welcome the
French naval demonstration in Turkish
waters as a setback to what the Rossiy i
terms "German pretensions in Turkey."
PARIS, Nov. 7.â A dispatch from Ad
miral Caillard has just been received an
nouncing that he landed marines on the
island of Mitylene this morning and oc
cupied the custom-house at Midilli with
out resistance.
Official advices received here say that
the Turkish authorities have cut the tele
graph line between Mitylene and Con
stantinople. Thus Admiral Caillard was
unable to communicate directly with M.
Bapste, counselor of the French legation
at Constantinople, and was obliged to flle
all dispatches at the island of Syra.
The French Government is fairly sat
isfied with the success achieved in the
dispute by the naval demonstration. The
Sultan has promised to settle all mone
tary claims and has offered guarantees
which fall little short of those demanded.
France, however, will Insist on full guar
antees and also on the surrender of Tur
key In the matter of treaty rights before
evacuating Mitylene.
No international complications are an
ticipated in view of the Porte's response
to France's note, and no trouble is ex
pected on the island itself.
The French Government has recelveJ
satisfactory replies without exception t3
its note explaining the measures against
Turkey. An excellent impression has been
created in official circles by the tone o!
the response of the United States, which
is couched in most friendly terms.
The Greek Minister in Constantinople,
according to a dispatch to a Paris news
agency from Athens, has telegraphed the
Greek Government that the Porte has ac
cepted all the demands of France.

TAMMANY HALL
BEING DESERTED
Leaders Fear the With
drawals Will Cause
a Big Panic.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 7.â Tammany Is pre
paring for wholesale resignations from, its
general committee. It is the opinion of
Richard Croker that 5000 at least, and per
haps twice that number, will be tempted
by the promise of places and will leave
Tammany to ally themselves with an in
tependent Democratic organization. He
takes a philosophical view of the situa
tion, however, believing that the deserters
will be of little loss and will be more
anxious to return than they are now to
get away.
Other Tammany leaders are less san
guine. They fear the withdrawal, of mem
bers will result in a panic and that the
organization will be weakened beyond
possibility of repair In time to make a
successful fight in 1903. More than that,
certain leaders are threatened with
punishment are Inclined to be obstinate,
and if pushed too hard they may take
their district organizations over to the
new enemy. â¢
David B. Hill's arrival in this city to
day, Immediately after the announcement
by the leaders of the Greater New York
Democracy that they Intended to con
tinue the war on Tammany until the or
ganization is wiped out of existence, was
regarded as significant.
â¢ Hill went to William F. Sheehan's law
office, where he conferred with Sheehnn
and later took lunchexm with him.
It is no secret that Hill advised the or
ganizers of the Greater New York Dem
ocracy from time to time, and that he
takes a deep interest in the organization
and will give it all the support he can.
It is known to his friends that he has in
mind the possibility of running for Presi
dent in 1904 arid that he desires to have
the New York delegation behind him at
that time. In order to accomplish this
Croker must be eliminated from the situa
tion.
"I am always glad to meet and talk with
Hill," said Sheehan. "My relations with
Hill are of the pleasantest nature. As to
our organization, it will represent the will
of the majority of Its members. It will be
time enough to define its attitude toward
State and national leaders when its dele
gations have been admitted to the State
convention.
"We don't want Croker. We can get
along without him. Any party can nyet
along without him. The city does not
want him. the country can spare him, and
the organised Democracy of New York
will have no use for him or for any of
hia fellow banditti."
are looking forward to higher prices In
thff near future. They say the people
will be forced to eat mutton instead of
beef, though even mutton will probably
become scarce later on. as the same coif
litions that urn diinlnUlilriK the beef sup
,ply will also effect the sheep supply.

CLAIMS HE IS TAKING
UP ABANDONED TRACKS
Superintendent Lynch of Market-
Street Company Explains to
Supervisors' Committee.
Superintendent of Construction Lynch,
of the Market Street Railway Company,
appeared before the Supervisors' Public
Utilities Committee yesterday to explain
why a number of abandoned rails and
slots had not been taken up by November
1. Lynch said that he was removing them
as fast as he could, but denied that he
had agreed to repave properly the streets
along the roadways of Ellis and Post
streets. Chairman Reed disagreed with
him and then produced a list of streets
on which the corporation had failed to
remove the rails.
Reed asked why the roadway on Page
street, between Devisadero and Scott, had
been repaved with basalt, when the rest
of the street is bltuminlzed. Lynch re
plied that the company never had a tracK
there. The abandoned tracks on Califor
nia street, between Montgomery and
Kearny, belong to the California ' Street
Railway Company. Lynch said. The slots
on Howard, street, between Second and
Tenth streets, had been left because the
Board of Works contemplated building an
intercepting sewer in tlje street. Lynch
would not agree to take up the rails with
in a prescribed time, but promised to pave
Oak and Post streets in conformity with
the rest of the pavement, as was done
on Broderick street.
YOUNG PIANTSTE WINS
PLAUDITS AT DEBUX
Miss Nora Sundy Gives Recital in
Which She Displays Talent of
High Order.
Miss Nora Sandy, a 14-year-old pianiste,
daughter of S. J. Sandy, the basso, made
her debut in recital last night In Sherman
Clay & Co.'s Hall. The little miss played
with an accuracy, delicacy and warmth
of interpretation that won her audience
She gives promise of great achievement
if the same earnest methods are contin
ued in her musical education.
The young planiste's first number was
Haydn's "Fantasia in D Major." Her
delicate touch, perfect time and sympa
thetic interpretation were at once dis
played. Her reception by the audience
was most flattering.
Miss Sandy also played Beethoven's dif
ficult "Rondo in G," Mendelssohn's "Ron
do Capriccioso" and "The Fountain," by
Lysberg.
Miss Katherine Black, soprano; R. La
raja, violinist; D.' Manlloyd, tenor; J. L.
yon der Mehden Jr., celloist; S. J. Sandy,
basso, and Signor S. Martinez, accom
panist, assisted in the recital.

DIMMICK ONCE
MORE ON TRIAL
Case Proceeds on Seven
.Counts Charging Em
bezzlement.
His Attorney Succeeds in
Striking Out Damaging
Evidence.
Walter N. Dimmick, ex-chief clerk of
the Mint, was placed on trial yesterday
before United States District Judge de
Haven and a jury on the second of the
three Indictments brought against him by
the United States Grand Jury. United
States District Attorney Woodworth, S.
C. Denson and Bert Schleslnger appeared
for the Government and George D. Col
lins for the defendant.
Dimmick is under sentence of two years'
imprisonment at hard labor In the State
prison at San Quentin on his conviction
on the first indictment.
By noon the following named jurors had
been impaneled: George A. Hensley, Jo
seph W.-Sanford, C. J. Waterhouse, J. B.
Whitney, W. F. Davis, A. C. Anderson,
E. J. Robinson, L. H. Cary, Alfred E.
Rhodes, J. H. Bruce, D. B. Crane and S.
C. Irving.
Charges in the Indictment.
The indictment charges the accused
with having embezzled the following
sums at the times stated: January 3,
1900, $362 47; April 7, 1900, $405 67; October 1,
1900, $418 42; October 1, 1900, $374 49; Janu
ary 3, 1901, $366 83; January 14, 1901, $364 08;
Jamiary 14, 1900, $608.
The foregoing constitute seven counts
in the indictment. Seven additional count*
allege that Dimmick, not being an author
ized depository of public moneys, used a
portion of public moneys â the seven sums
mentionedâ for a purpose not prescribed
by law, namely, for his own uses. A third
â¢series of seven counts charges Dimmick
with having feloniously failed to deposit
the sums mentioned in the Sub-Treasury
of the United States on or before the end
of the quarter during: which they were re
ceived by him.
The case is similar In many respects to
the one in which the defendant was con
victed a short time ago, but the evidence,
if anything, will be stronger for the prose
cution, as intimated by Mr. Schlesinger
In his opening statement to the jury. Mr.
Schlesinger said that he proposed to
prove, among other things, that on one
occasion when Superintendent Frank
Leach asked the defendant to produce a
certain sum of money which he had re
ceived from the Selby Smelting and Lead
Company, Dimmick replied that he hoped
Mr. Leach would not insist on the imme
diate production of the money, because
if he should do so Dimmick would be
placed in the position of an embezzler,
and would be In danger of the peniten
tiary.
Witnesses for Government.
Three witnesses were called on behalf
of the Government yesterday â Theodore
Gray, bookkeeper for the Selby Company;
Assistant Cashier Corbett of the same
company; J. L. Andre, its messenger; Ira
T. Blackwood, Its assistant cashier, and
Frank Leach, superintendent of the Mine.
They identified Government exhibits num
bers 1, 2, 3. 4, 5, 6 and 7, being the receipt
ed bills of the Selby Company for the
money paid to the Mint for material re
ceived from that institution. The bills
bore the red rubber stamped #ates of pay
ment as alleged in the Indictment, but
the Selby witnesses could riot swear posi
tively that the money uad been paid to
Dimmick, and considerable of their evi
dence on that point was stricken out, on
the motion of Mr. Collins, as hearsay.
Superintendent Leach had barely con
cluded his explanation of the account
books of the Mint with reference to the
transactions before the court when tha
hour for adjournment arrived. The trial
will be resumed at 11 this morning.
ALLOWS HIS WIFE AND
CHILDREN TO SUFFER
Patrick Smith Prefers to See His
"Wife Die Rather Than
Work.
A woman, prostrate with an attack of
acute pneumonia, and four children suf
fering from hunger was the sad spectacle
which met the eyes of the officers of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children yesterday at the home of Pat
rick Smith, 903 Illinois street.
Smith is a laborer who spends all of
his small earnings in drink. His wife,
until she was taken sick, which was re
cently, supported the family by taking in
washing. Overwork and exposure, how
ever, made her ill and in consequence pro
visions ran low. The husband failed to
summon medical attendance and the wo
man was in a very precarious condition
when found yesterday. Some neighbors
had made some slight contributions of
food for the children and Smith lived o>i
these and some liquor whlcn he had se
cured.
As he seemed perfectly able to work,
had he been so inclined. Officer McMur
ray decided that the best place for him
was in prison, and accordingly made the
arrest. Mrs. Smith was removed to the
City and County Hospital and the ch..
dren were placed in the Youths' Direc
tory.
WHITE MASKED BUBGLAB
MAKES ANOTHEB VISIT
Enters the Residence of A. H. Brown
and Covers Victim. "With a
Revolver.
The burglar with the white mask who
is operating in the outskirts of the West
ern Addition has again been heard from.
Captain Seymour was notified yesterday
morning that he had paid a visit to the
residence of A. H. Brown, 3867 Clay street.
Brown was awakened between 2 and 3
yesterday morning by a noise in his bed
room and on opening his eyes he saw
the burglar with the white mask, who
pointed a revolver at him and told him
to keep auiet. The burglar grabbed a
pair of trousers which contained a dollar
and backed out of the room and the
house.
Brown described him as a young man
about 5 feet 7 or 8 inches in height and
weighing about 150 pounds. Captain Sey
mour la satisfied he is the same young
man who entered the residence of Len
Owens 3232 Jackson street, early Tues
day morning, and after an interesting
conversation with Owens left with some
clothing which contained $60. Every ef
fort is being made to capture the daring
burglar.
Drinks Poison and Dies.
Mrs. Annie Harryhausen, about 40 years
of age, committed suicide by drinking
poison in the Valencia Hotel at 718 Valen
cia street, Wednesday night. She left fare
well notes to her brother and sister, tell
ing them that she desired to quit- the earth
because of illness. Mrs. Harryhausen ap
plied for a room Wednesday night, say
ing she wished it for a week. Yesterday
afternoon she did not respond to a call
and the door was forced. When a cham
bermaid and Special Policeman Reed en
tered they found her dead. . A bottle of
morphine stood on a table and another of
laudanum was clutched in her hand.
Ohe's Wife Has Fled.
The case of Henry Ohe, butcher, charged
with an assault to do grievous bodily
harm upon his wife, was called in Judge
Mogan's court yesterday. Mrs. Ohe failed
to appear, and the JudÂ«e was notified
that she had fled from trie city, as she
did not wish to prosecute her husband.
It was said she had gone to Geyserville,
and the Judge instructed Petective Rior
dan to make an investigation and report
to him Monday.
TJllmer Was Justified.
The case of Moses Ullmer, charged with
assault with a deadly weapon upon Albert
Price, stock broker, on LeidesdorfT street,
by striking him on the head with a cane,
was dismissed by Judge Mogan yester
day. The Judge said he was satisfied that
Â«no jury would convict the defendant, as
Price had instigated the attack by calling
Ullmer offensive names.
PRUNE BRANDY
NOT A SUCCESS
Experiments Show It to
Be of No Commer
cial Value.
Francis Korbel Gives Re
sults of His Investi
gations.
It will be with great interest and some
disappointment that the friends of the
California prune and* distillers all over
the State receive the result of Francis
Korbt'l's experiments with tha fruit as
the foundation for a marketable brandy.
After more than a year of experiment and
investigation he has arrived at the con
clusion that prune brandy is not commer
cially practicable.
Francis Korbel of 203 Battery street is,
la addition to being Consul in this port
for the Austro-Hungarian empire, a dis
tiller of wide experience. Ii was sup
. posed that from the prune could be made
a brandy, etieap and marketable. Pruna
growing is a big industry in this State,
and anything which would add to the de
mand tor the fruit would be of inestima
ble importance to California.
Korbel is a large prune grower, and It
was with a good deal of personal interest
that he undertook the task of turning out
prune brandy.
His experiments have extended â¢ over
many months. He made a brandy which
was fairly good, but which had neither
cheapness of production nor any special
quality to recommend it over the already
famous grape brandies of the State
Mr. Korbel also went East and to Eu
rope with the view of finding a market
for the prune product in some of ltd
stages.
In the highly distilled product he found
nothing that could be of advantage either
to the California prune grower or to the
distiller. Mr. Korbel said:
I managed to make a first-rate prune brandy
but at a cost Just about the same as the
grape product. Americans will not drink out
of-the-way liquors. When they want brandy
they want the real thing and will not patron
ize a substitute, no matter how good it may
be. It might be possible In certain parts of
Europe to work up a demand for this product,
but the market- would be too limited to make
it worth while.
I thought at flr^t that the "slngllngs" might
have a commercral value, but found that the
internal revenue tax would place even that
crude beverage beyond the means of the only
people that would drink It.
The "slngllngs" taste strongly ot the prune.
They are well charged with fusel oil. They
make a strong smelling, harsh tasting drink,
and in its rasping nastiness a large number
of the pdor foreigners located In Pittsburg
and Chicago find an ideal beverage.
The tax on "slngllngs." however, brings up
the price to as much as we could ask for a
universally marketable product. I have come
to the conclusion that prune brandy is not a
marketable possibility, and that the grower
can make more money by selling his fruit at
$20 a ton than by using It as the foundation
for a brandy.
"TOMMY" WALLACE BOOKED
ON BURGLARY CHARGE
Is Criminal Who Became Notorious
by Stealing the Valuable
Painting "Elaine."
"Tommy" Wallace, one of the cleverest
crooks in the country, was arrested at
an early hour yesterday morning and
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
burglary. When searched a bunch of
skeleton keys and a key for picking the
locks of trunks were found in his pockets.
Between 2 and 3 o'clock Patrick O'Neill,
a painter, who lives at 19 Market street.
saw a man disappearing from his room.
He jumped out cf bed and gave chase
and the stranger ran into the arms of
Policemen Mullander and Clifford. He
had taken $S3 from O'Neill's trouser pock
ets. He gave the name of Oeorge Wil
liams, but was identified in prison as the
notorious "Tommy" Wallace, ex-convict.
Wallace came into notoriety in this city
in 1878, when he stole the valuable paint
ing "Elaine," by Toby Rosenthal, from
the art rooms at Kearny and Mor
ton streets. He escaped from the
County Jail, but was soon after arrested
in Cincinnati and brought back to serve
his term. He was reporting every week
to Captain Seymour and professing to be
leading a moral life. He will likely spend
his remaining days in jail.

BOY IDENTIFIES
RICE'S MURDERER
A. Cleve Gives Damaging
Testimony Against
Suspect.
Prosecution Rests Its Case
After Examining Many
Witnesses.
The preliminary examination of William
Buckley, Thomas Moran, Charles Donnel
ly and Edward Duncan, on the charge of
murdering George W. Rice, the non-union
machinist, at Twentieth and Howard
streets, on the evening of October 11, was
continued before Judge Mogan yesterday.
After over a dozen witnesses had been
examined, the prosecution rested and the
case was continued till to-morrow morn
ing, when the defense will announce
whether any evidence will be offered.
The most important witness examined
â¢was Arthur Cleve, a boy 16 years of age,
Â¦who works for A. J. McNicoll & Co., ele
vator repairers. He testified that he was
sitting on the front of the car and saw
W. J. Piatt and his daughter, who were
the first witnesses examined, sitting there.
He also noticed the defendants, Buckley
and Moran, standing- together on the car.
Moran, he said, occasionally jumped off
the' car and looked behind where Rice
was sitting. When the car reached Twen
tieth street he saw a man clubbing Rice,
but it was not Moran. Buckley got off
the car and fired the shots at Rice as he
lay on his back on the street. He was
asked to identify Buckley, and he walked
from the witness stand to where Buckley
was sitting and placed his hand on his
shojlder. Buckley turned perceptibly pale.
He pointed to Moran as the man who ran
away with Buckley and the man who did
the clubbing. They ran toward Shotwell
street and he saw Buckley turn the cor
ner -toward Nineteenth street.
The boy's evidence differs from that of
Piatt and his daughter, who testified that
Moran was the man who did the clubbing,
but otherwise it entirely corroborates it.
The other witnesses examined were:
Drs. Maher and Rlxford. of the City and
County Hospital: Lieutenant Price, Detec
tives Graham and Fitzgerald, Dr. Baeiga
lupi. autopsy surgeon; Dr. W. J. Mahonev
E. H. Mills. Miss Fannie Dowdall, Charles
Angelus, motorman, and William Spiess.
conductor of the car; W. H. Kidd and
John Boost.

BANKERS ARE WARNED TO LOOK OUT
FOR NOTES STOLEN BY HIGHWAYMEN
Pinkerton Detective Agency Actively Engaged in Work of
Running Down Members of Notorious Curry Gang,
Who Are Wanted for Many Robberies and Murders
THE arrival in this city yesterday
of Colonel William A. Pinkerton,
the noted head of the National
Detective Agency, will result in
extra vigilance on the part of
bankers and business men throughout the
State in watching for persons who may
try to pass a quantity of bank notes
stolen in the hold-up of the Great North
ern Railway train, near Wagner, Mont.,
on July 3 last by the notorious "Curry
gang."
The vigilance of the Pinkerton detec
tives Is being exercised not only on the
Pacific Coast but throughout the entire
republic, and the word passed all over
the country is to secure the members of
the gang, despite the cost.
The history of the Curry gang reads
like a dime novel, for it is replete with
robbery and cold-blooded murder. Mem
bers of the gang have fallen before the
bullets of brave officers, while the rob
bers have taken the lives of officials in
border to escape the felon's doom.
The operations of the "Curry gang" ex
tend o\er the past six years and the fa
vorite hiding place of the members has
been the "Hole in the Wall" country in
Wyoming. The members of the gang
were cowboys and their first steps in
crime were taken as "rustlers," or cattle
thieves. The leader of the band is Har
vey I^ogan, alias "Harvey Curry," alias
"Kid Curry," aiias "Bob Jones," alias
"Tom Jones." Associates of the leader
were his brother, Louis Logan, alias
"Louis Curry," alias "Lonny Curry"; R.
E. Curry, alias "Bob Curry." alias "Bob
Lee"; John Curry, alias "John Logan";
Georse Curry. George Parker, alias
"Hutch Capsidy." alias "George Cassidy.''
alias "Ingerfield": Harry Longbaugh,
:.lias "Kid Lonsrbaugh," alias "Harry
Alonzo"; O. C. Hanks, alias "Camilla
Hanks." alias "Charlie Jones." alias
"Deaf Chariie"; Maud Jones, alias "An
nie Rodgers." alias "Maude Williams"
and a woman known as "Lillian Rose."
Bullets have ended the career of John
Curry, George Curry and Lonny Logan;
Harry Longbaugh and Lillian Rose were
arrested in St. Louis last Tuesday night:
Maud Jones is in custody in Nashvil!e,
Term.; R. E. Curry is in prison and offi
cers are close on the trail of Harvey Lo
gan, the leader, who made a sensational
fight In Nashville, Term., three weeks ago

the gang and those who are at large will
be hunted down relentlessly.
First of the Band Is Killed.
Six years ago the Logan boys operated
in Western Montana, assisted by John
Curry. In attempting to steal horses,
John Curry was killed by a wealthy
rancher, Jifn Winters. This made Har
vey ar.d Louis Logan outlaws and they
located in the "Hole in the Wall" coun
try in Wyoming. With the other cut
throats whose names are mentioned they
met there, the "Curry gang" was organ
ized and it robbed the bank at Belle-
Fouche, S. D. Four of the robbers were
arrested, but Longbaugh and Harvey Lo
gan broke jail. The bank was robbed
in 1897 and a hunt was made for the rob
bers who escaped, but it was unsuccess
ful.
On June 2. 1899. the gang held up tho
Union Pacific train at Wilcox, Wyo. Tbe
express car wa3 blown to splinters with
dynamite and $20,000 in cash and a quan
tity of unsigned currency of the First Na
tional Bank of Portland, Or., was secured
by the robbers. ; ..\ \ - t :. .
Sheriff Josiah Hazen of Converse Coun
ty; Wyoming, led a posse in pursuit of
the robbers, but two days after the hold
up Hazen and 'one of his deputies were
killed in a fight with the outlaws. The
murderers got away and reached tha
"Hole in 'the Wall" country, where pui
sult was impossible. .â¢ - Â¦
The Pinkerton agency was set to work
by the railroad company. Superintendent
George B. Sayers. who is now located in
San Francisco, took up the work, ha
traced the gang from the "Hole in tho
Wall" country through Wyoming. Utah.
Kansas. Colorado. Arizona. Arkansas.
Mississippi and back to Arizona where
the trail was lost, as the gang dispersed.

Blew Car to Splinters.
Â¦ On June 21, 1900, the gang held up a
Union. Pacific train at Tipton, Mont. Th
v express car was blown to Â¦. splinters by
dynamite, but robbers only secured
$200 in cash, the expected consignment of
coin not being on the train. The robbers
left seventy pounds of dynamite behind
them, Â¦ and again the railroad ''company
offered a large reward for : the capture of

Although -the 'Â¦ whole country was

BOSSES' DEFEAT
A GOOD LESSON
Republicans Are Happy
Over Result of the
Battle.
Greatest Gain for Clean
Government Since Elec
tion of Bard.
The independent Republicans, to the
number of 10,000, who filed a potent protest
against bossism by voting for Eugene
E. Schmitz or Joseph S. Tobin, are not
likely to Join in any movement for the es
tablishment of a new political party.
They are determined, however, to have
their rights in the Republican party. The
machine politicians have learned a lesson
that they will long remember. A new
order of party leadership must be the re
sult. It is no wonder that Republican
voters were disgusted at the spectacle of
two Democratsâ W. F. Herrin and Jere
Burkeâ preparing a ticket for the Repub
lican party.
The independent anti-machine Republi
can voters now present their compliments
to Judge McKinley of Los Angeles,
Johnny Mackenzie of San Jose, A. B.
Lemmon of Santa Rosa and others of th=s
State Committee and beg to remind the I
gentlemen from the interior that State
interference in local concerns is not a :
good thing for the party that interferes.
The Call desires the Republican news
papers throughout the S*ate to recall an
incident of the State Central Committee's
Indorsement of the Kelly-Crimmins- i
Burns-Lynch County Committee: Judge |
McKinley of Los Angeles came here with
a typewritten decision of the controversy;
within five minutes after Augustus Tilden
and A. Ruef, representing respectively the
two contending factions, had closed the
argument. Judge McKinley produced Cue
typewritten decision and read it to the
members of the State body assembled in
Golden Gate Hall. It was instantly
adopted.
The friends of Kelly, Crimmins, Gage ;
and Burns went away from the hall
laughing immoderately at the undoing, as
they supposed, of the Republican Primary
League. The merriment was premature,
as the league came forward again with
renewed strength, and the machine bosses
were compelled to expend $25,000 or $30,000 i
to buy Democratic votes in order to de
feat the anti-boss Republicans at the pri- j
mary. Now comes the revelation that
Wells, who was nominated for Mayor by i
the bosses did not receive as many votes j
at the general election as were thrown
for the Republican ticket in the primary
contest last August.
The downfall of the bosses in San Fran- ;
Cisco will add strength to the Republican j
party in the State. It is the greatest vic
tory for clean politics since the election I
of Mr. Bard to the United States Senate.
The passing of Herrin, Lynch and Burke
to Join Dibble and Cosper in retirement i
is observed with peculiar satisfaction. Â¦
Rainey will go back to the Democratic I
party, where he belongs, and should take ]
Herrin and Jere Burke along as an escort. |

men were soon on the spot and closely |
questioned the womin, but she would not j
give them any information. She was held j
pending further investigation. Last Sun- j
day week a well-dressed man entered a i
store in Nashville and offered a $20 note :
in payment of a small purchase. The ;
storekeeper could not change it and went :
to a neighbor to secure change. The note ;
was recognized there as one of those de- i
scribed in the Pinkerton circular. Two
detectives v.vre summoned by telephone
and they questioned the stranger. He
gave his name as Ferguson and said he |
was from Texas. The officers informed
him that he was under arrest, when in i
en instant Ferguson drew two big re
volvers. The officers grappled with him i
but he fought them oft, dashed Into th-i !
street and Jumped into a passing ice |
wagon. He drcve the wagon at a fast
rate and was lost to sight by the battered
detectives. Wtien the horses of the ice
wagon fell exhausted the man held up n. j
passing buggy and made his escape into |
the country. j
The woman, Annie Rodgers, denied
knowing Ferguson, but the Pinkertons
followed up a clew and in Fort Worta.
Tex., found photographs of her and a
man who was thought by the Nashville
detectives to be Ferguson. In Fort
Worth the Pinkertons learned that Annie
Russell was the consort of a rancher
named Bob Neville, who lived in Texas,
and that she was known as Maud Jones. )
A search for Bob Neville revealed the !
astonishing fact that he was none other
than Harvey Logan, alias Curry, the j
much-wanted murderer, train robber, cat- |
tie thief and all round "bad man."
The Pinkertons do not think that Fer
guson, who appeared In Nashville, was
Harvey Logan, as the former made no :
attempt to kill the detectives who sought i
to arrest him. Harvey Logan has a
record of four murders and Colonel Will
iam A. Pinkerton says that the outlaw
would not stop at increasing his list of
murders in order to escape arrest.
Annie Russell, alias "Maud Jones." was '
questioned in the Jail at Nashville on
Monday, but Fhe refused to give any in- 'Â¦
formation as to where the much-wanted
outlaw, Logan, could be found. The ;
Pinkertons feel sure that the man "Fer- |
gruson." who escaped from the detectives
In Nashville, is George Parker, alias |
"Butch Cassidy," one of the Curry gang
of outlaws and murderers.
Two days ago word came to the Pink- !
ertons that some of the stolen unsigned i
notes were being passed in St. Louis. }
The watch was redoubled and resulted In |
the capture of Harry Longbaugh. alias
"Harry Alonzo," one of the gang, to
gether with a female accomplice, "Lil
lian Rose."
The couple were registered at a hotel i
as Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Rose and $8500 of Â¦
the unsigned notes stolen In the hold-up |
at Wagner last July was found In their i
possession.
Description of Stolen Notes.
