The expense of the revolution has been
enormous. The Government is alleged to
have already spent not less than $120,000,000
in silver to suppress the rebellion, and the
Liberals are said to have spent even a
larger amount, although their volunteers
are supposed to serve solely for patriotism
and to receive no pay. The republic is
involved in a financial slough and wonder
is expressed where the money will come
from for the purchase of a new warship
which is being generally discussed.
' Colombia has been the chief sufferer, as
her revolution has already lasted nearly
two years. It is estimated that from 25,000
to 40,000 lives have already been sacrificed
and the end is rot yet, as the smoldering
embers of revoit are coming into name in
a dozen sections simultaneously, and the
Liberals do not hesitate to announce that
they are preparing to deal a* final blow.
Colombia the Chief Sufferer.
Trouble is Imminent on both the. eastern
and southern boundaries of Colombia.
Troops have been rushed in both direc
tions, and the frontiers of Venezuela and
Ecuador are lined with armed men ready
to advance at a moment's notice. No
secret Is made of the threatening attitude
of the Colombian authorities. They assert
that the revolution here has been enabled
.to continue only -by aid of the Liberal
governments of neighboring Republics,
' and that to insure peace at home it has
become necessary to inaugurat 3 a war of
foreign conquests. It is assumed here
that Ecuador would join with Venezuela
in any movement against Colombia, the
two Liberal governments standing united
against the Conservative element In con
trol here, and making counter charges of
interference with their affairs and ' of
fostering revolutions.

Judge Barnard sustained the demurrer

such a proceeding as that involving the

the stock exhibit is exceptionally fine.
The pavilion display was increased, espe

great interest was manifested in the ex

_Edward Griffith, Secretary of Forestry,
Washington, . gave a comprehensive de
scription of the Black Hills forest re
serve, which contains a population of 25,
000, including the two cities of Lead and
Deadwood. Prof essor " L. H. Pammell of
Ames, In Iowa, in discussing the question,
"What Should Be the Policy of the Gov
ernment in the Ulntah Forest Reserve?"
took a strong position against permitting
sheep to graze thereon. He arraigned the
present policy of the Government as ruin
ous to the best interests of the forest.
With 200,000 sheep in the reserve the her
baceous plants are cut . down - in such â¢ a
manner that the forest covering, so im
portant for the starting of a young forest
growth, is entirely prevented.' Five years
ago there was - an abundance of feed
where, at thepresent time, many of the
herds can .scarcely find picking. Former
ly water was much more abundant than
now. Perennial 1 springs have ceased. The
ponds, lakes and meadows are drying up.
Sheep are driven into the reserve in de
fiance of law and regulations. If the for
ests are to be protected the Government
must exert its authority.
The question of grazing, like every other that
affects the natural forest, reserves, is a ques
tion of the greatest good to the'greatest'num
ber. The problem is how best to use the forest
reserves for the promotion of all. the business
interests ot the communities in or near which
they lie. The reserves contain vast quantities
of 'grass and other forage which can only be
harvested by grazing animals.. Except in cases
where grazing directly antagonizes interests of
greater importance to the community there is
every reason why it should be permitted under
sensible regulations. Moderate grazing may pro
ceed in most of the reserves Â¦ wholly without
injury to the forest except in specified localities
and greatly I to ! the advantage of the general
community. Overgrazing destroys both the for
est and the grazing industry itself. : The ques
tion is purely a local one, to be decided in each
case on its own merits, but there is no case in
which overgrazing Is anything but a calamity.
This afternoon papers on the United
States Government forest work were read
and discussed. William L. Hall's paper
was on "Progress in Tree Planting," and
showed the increased - interest felt over
the country in the planting of forest trees.
Gifford Pinchot of Washington, Forester
of the Department of Agriculture, read a
paper on "Grazing in the Forest Re

Star Millâ Men still at work upon two

Developments of tho Day.
This statement will have Its effect, be
cause of the fact that the tin plate trade
has always been considered as among thV
strongholds of, the Amalgamated Asso
ciation, and tne "defl" appears to have
been brought about by the association
declaring: a strike â¢ against the tin plate
company after the scale for the year cad
been signed. Notwithstanding the fact
that the Amalgamated people claim justi
fication on the ground that their constitu
tion provides for such procedure the offi
cials of the tin plate company consider
the action a breach of trust and say that
henceforth they are determined to cut
loose from union labor entirely.
The association officials treat the threat
with indifference, their only reply . being
that the company cannot carry out its
plan because nearly all the skilled tin
workers of the country are members of
the association and the plants cannot be
run without them. The corporation, how
ever, has started several of their plants
In a way and say they have all the men
necessary within reach to operate them

proper shape. â¢ . ~. \
PITTSBURG, Aug. 27.â Practically the
only significant event in the strike to-day
was the positive stand taken* by the
American Tin Plate Company in reference
to its 'course in the future. An official
statement from this company to-day de
nies that there are any negotiations on
foot looking to a settlement of the strike
and authorized the statement that mills
put into operation during the strike will
be continued non-union and all men going
to work now will, be retained in their po
sitions.
Lieutenant Joyce, defendant in the case
on trial, was called to the witness stand
later in the day. Joyce denied everything.
He declared that the statements made by
Lieutenant McSweeney, Sergeant Cramer,
Detective Tracy and Chief of Police O'Neill
implicating . him with the Larkin matter
were untrue. He denied any knowledge of
the Larkin case, of the movement of the
officers and that they were paid for bring
ing the prisoner back from Cleveland. .
CHICAGO, Aug. 27.â The connection of
Sergeant Cramer, Detective Tracy and
Lieutenant Joyce with the bogus expense
account which has enveloped in a scandal
the detective j bureau and its chief, Cap
tain Colleran, was told to-day by Chief of
Police O'Neill, who took the stand during
the afternoon session of the Civil Service
Commission sitting as a trial board to
investigate the matter.
The developments created a sensation,
particularly so when Chief O'Neill toid of
the alleged confessions of his subordi
nates, which they had in the main denied
on the stand or saved themselves from re.
peating on the grounds of self-incrimina
tion. The Chief also told how Captain
Colleran and Lieutenant Joyce, as he al
leges, received their share of the spoils. s
The only thing not revealed was the
source of Information that led to the un
earthing of the scandal.
Attorney Gash, representing Lieutenant
Joyce, made many attempts to confuse the
evidence of, the Chief of Police. Gash
charged that the Chief was making false
statements and said that the witness was
actuated by an unfriendly feeling toward
Lieutenant Joyce, all of- which I Chief
O'Neill denied indignantly. *
All of the directors are new with the
exception of Mr. Linderman and Mr.
Stclesbury, who served on the other
board. George F. Baer is president of the
Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Com
pany. Mr. Stolesbury is a member of the
firm of Drexel <& Co. J. H. Ord and
Charles McVengh are said to be New
York capitalists. Messrs. Linderman, Mc
llvaine and Johnson were connected with
the old Bethlehem Steel Company, the
former as president. !Â¦'Â¦ .... .
President McJlvaine declined to state
whether Mr. Schwab had purchased the
stock for himself or for other persons.
He declared, however, that the company
would remain Independent, but would be
more aggressive than it had been in the
past.
Schwab agreed to purchase the.Bethle
hem' Steel stock at $24 a share, provided
tho Bethlehem Iron I Company was in
cluded in the sale." A meeting of, the
stockholders of the iron company was
held, at which it- was decided to sell to
the steel company. Then the directors of
both companies agreed to accept Schwab's
offer. Yesterday, was fixed as "the limit
for depositing the stock to be sold. Many
of the shareholders, it is said, did not
avail themselves of the . opportunity, but
the time will be extended for them. The
stock which has been deposited with the
trust company, other -than that paid for
tcrday, will be taken up within the next
twenty days at the same rate per share. 2
The new- board is as follows: R. -P.
Linderman, E. T. Stolesbury, E. M. Mc
llvaine, Archibald Johnson, George F.
Baer, J. P. Ord, Charles Me Veagh.
The officers are: E. M. Mcllvaine, presi
dent; A. E. Borie, vice president; H. S.

urer; Archibald Johnson, general superin
tendent. < Â¦ â¢.
The regular monthly meeting of the
directors of .the company was set for 11
o'clock this TOorning. At that hour ,a
quorum of the board was present, but no
word had been received from Mr. Schwab.
The meeting was adjourned until 12:30
o'clock, and, as Mr. Schwab's representa
tive had not yet appeared, a further ad
journment was taken until 2 o'clock.
When the directors met finally Max Pam
of New York was present representing
Mr. Schwab, and the stock and money
were speedily transferred. Mr. Pam had
arranged with Drexel & Co. to pay the
required amount to the Girard Trust Com
pany, and when. word was received that
the stock on Jeposlt had been delivered
the new directors were elected.

Amalgamated Association headquarters

nothing to do with the removal of the
mill, which was decided on long ago.
Business men fear the removal of the en
tire plant."
The excitement at McKeesport at mid
night Is Intense. Between 200 and 300 1
strikers are parading- the streets In an
_angry mood over renorts to the effect
that the Demmler tin plate plant would
resume at 6 o'clock In the morning. About
10 o'clock a boat was seen endeavoring to
raake a landing near the mills. As soon
as the strikers caught sight of the boat
a roar went up and a rush was made for
the river bank. The boat was then seen
to turn around and again go down tha
river. .'

The list of witnesses prepared by Judgo
Advocate Lemly and transmitted to Ad
miral Schley will be made public to-mor
row. Some time ago Admiral Schley, la
sending his list of witnesses to the de
partment, Included a request for all tho
officers of the Brooklyn. The department
replied that a number of the officers of
the Brooklyn would be on the list pre
pared by the department, and asked to
have specifically named the Brooklyn's
officers he desired. The admiral respond
ed to-day through Captain Parker of his
counsel. He gave the names of the prin
cipal officers of the Brooklyn and also of
seven petty officers, including the quarter
masters who were at the wheel during the
action off Santiago.
PHILADELPHIA; Aug. 27.â The Record
to-morrow will say that Albert H.
O'Brien, a prominent member of the Phil
adelphia bar, has been called In as as
sistant counsel for Rear Admiral Schley*
in the coming investigation at Washing
ton. Last Thursday Mr. O'Brien was in
"Washington in consultation with Admiral
Schley's counsel and materially assisted
them in the preparation of the brief in the
court of inquiry. During the late sixties
Mr. O'Brien occupied the post of Judge
advocate of the "West Indian fleet, and in
1869 was stationed at Annapolis, where
Schley was lieutenant commander, a
warm friendship developed there between,
the two men. Mr. O'Brien resigned from
the navy in 1875 and took up the practice
of law in Philadelphia.
It was learned to-day that "W. H. Stay-
Ion of the law firm of Staylon & Cham
bers of New Tork was expected at the
Navy Department to-morrow, and it U
supposed that his purpose is to consult
the record of the department in the in
terest of Admiral Sampson. Mr. Staylon
is a graduate of the Naval Academy, who.
though coming out at the head of his
class, elected to join the Marine Corps.
He was detailed to duty in the office or
the judge advocate general and later re
signed to practice law.
It may, in its pleasure, deny the person
under investigation the privilege of hav
ing counsel present before the court, or,
on the other hand. It may go the length
of permitting persons in secondary inter
est the privilege of employing 1 counsel be
fore the court. So the offlcials say they
have no knowledge officially of the reten
tion of counsel by Admiral Sampson, but
privately it is admitted that he expects .to
be so represented.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 27.â It is Trader
stood that Admiral Sampson la to be rep
resented before the Schley court of in
quiry by counsel, though the navy offi
cials say they have no official knowledge
on the subject and point to the fact that

Accused Inspector Jos
sey Is Accidentally
Killed.
â¢ /-
TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 27.â 3. F. Jossey,
United States Chinese Inspector, was ac
cidentally shot and killed this morning
at his home In this city. The Coroner's
jury returned a verdict of death by the
accidental discharge of a gun.
Jossey heard a disturbance among his
poultry during the night, arose from bed,
took a shotgun and, atiired in his night
dress, went to investigate. A few mo
ments later the report of the gun was
heard. Mrs. Jossey, thinking her husband
had fired at a polecat! called out, "Did
you kill him?" No one answered. She
called a second time, and, still receiving
no reply, ran out and found Jossey pros
trate, with a gaping wound in his left
breast His gun was eight feet from him.
The email steoladder which he had at
tempted to mount to fire over the fence
into the poultry-yard had -fallen as ho
stepped upon it, and his gun had evidently
been prematurely discharged.
The fact that Jossey was accused of
complicity in the Chinese smuggling at
Nogales at first aroused suspicions of
suicide, but these were dispelled by the
evidence brought out at the inquest. Jos
sey was from Americus, Ga., and was ap-
Young Mellin, resides with his parents at
213 Elm street, Oakland. As soon as the
accident occurred a message was sent to
his. mother telling her. of the terrible ac
cident that had befallen her son.
The accident was caused by the care
lessness of one of the men working in the
building. Young Mellin had taken a
number of cases to the fourth floor of the
building on the elevator, which is an
open affair, and had succeeded in getting
all the heavy cases but one off the plat
form. He was struggling. with that when
some one on one of the floors beneath
pulled the rope and started the elevator
downward. The heavy case, one-half >of
which rested on the flooring, toppled over
as the elevator commenced to sink,. and
struck the boy, knocking him off the other
side of the elevator platform. He fell the
entire distance, turning over and over in
the descent, and alighting: on the cement
floor of the basement on his hands and
feet. The shock jerked his head down
ward and his chin struck with- sufficient
force to cut a deep gash and shatter the
bone. " Â¦ . â¢ .
That the bravo boy will die .is almost
sure, as the shock in addition to the
broken bones is much more than even a
strong man could stand: The fall caused
a compound fracture of his left thigh, a
fracture of the right thigh, a fracture of
both his arms and a compound fracture of
the lower jaw.
The boy was* conscious all the time and
stood, the examination like a Spartan. Dr.
Armlstead and the- nurses handled him as
carefully as possible, but even the weight
of a cloth on his bruised body caused him
untold . agony. His shop mates who
brought him to the hospital spoke. to him
soothingly and sought, to convince him
that he was more scared than hurt, but
the little fellow knew better. His. pain
racked frame told him the extent of his
injuries. Â¦ ; ...
Mellin was -hurried to the Emergency
Hospital, and an examination showed that
almost every bone in his body had been
broken. How he escaped instant death
could not be explained by the doctors, and
as they proceeded : to examine 'into the
extent of his injuries they , wondered
more. " '
Those who saw him fall ran- to the base
ment expecting to find him lifeless, but he
was not even unconscious. The only sign
of injury .was a deep gash in his chin, but
when they sought ; to move - him he
shrieked in agony.
Edward Mellin, aged 16 years and em
ployed as a press feeder by .the Union
Lithographing Company in the Halleck
bulldlng N at 325 Sansome street, fell from
the fourth floor, of -the building to the
basement yesterday and received injuries
that will probably prove fatal. That he
was not killed outright seems miraculous,
as the basement floor is made of cement.

the fact that when he voiced his fear to

in the transaction. He had, however,
made a memorandum in pencil on the fly

the other vouchers. Beyond this memor

show either that he had paid the money
to Dimmick or subsequently received the
amount.
"Perhaps I did. It seems to me that
Cole made some explanation which satis
fied me at the time. He told me that he
had been under the influence of the fear
that there was something wrong with the
transaction for over a year."
Attorney Collins asked Leach whether
he had not demanded from Cole an expla
nation for the delay.

DEATH STOPS
LAW'S INQUIRY
This is the voucher upon which Dim
mick procured from Cole the sum of $498 37
and which he subsequently redeemed. Cole
gave him the money In February, 1900.
Cole thought it was irregular at the time,
said Leach, but did not report the matter
until a year Jater. Leach thought the
reason for Cole's delay in speaking about
the transaction was that he was inexpe
rienced, having held his position as cash
ier but six months at the time.
This voucher, known in the case as ex
hibit A, was made. Leach testified, by his
instructions. It represented a transaction
between the Mint and the Selby Smelting
Company, but involved no cash. It was
one of a number of vouchers made to cor
rect an error whereby a transaction in
lead had gone through the Selby account
on the Mint books. This and the other
vouchers Leach says he ordered Dimmick
to indorse "Voucher void with cashier."
In the case of some of the vouchers these
instructions were followed, but exhibit A
was simply marked "Canceled."
Cole Has a Fear. , â¢
The "fear" was first conceived when
Dimmick handed Cole the voucher for
549S37, upon which the present charge
against the' ex-chief clerk is founded, and
told him to make no entry therefor. It
was brought forth when Cole reported to
Superintendent Leach last February that
there was something strange about Dim
mick's methods and that there ought to
be an investigation.
UNDER the fire of cross-examina
tion by Attorney George D. Col
lins Frank A. Leach, superin
tendent of the Mint, yesterday
afternoon told United States
Commissioner Heacock the story of a
"fear" \rhich had entered the mind of
Cashier Cole In February, 1900, and re
mained carefully tucked away until the
corresponding month of the present year.

note, "The above was recently added.- F.

The entry and the first note were in
Dimmick's handwriting. The second note
was made by Leach. He testified â¢ that
the Dimmick note had been added after
the discovery of the loss of the $30,000, and
that he had called attention to its recent
insertion for the benefit of the District
Attorney and to refresh his own memory.
DOCTORS MARVEL
AT HIS ESCAPE
jVANCAUVER, B. C, Aug. 27.â From
official ', advices from "Washington â¢ to
Tfnited: States Immigration. Inspector
Healy. it is probable that in the near fu
ture; a large number of . Japanese labor-,
ers will be going. to Honolulu and Amer
ican coast ports. It, appears that recent T
ly Kogora" Takahira,'. Japanese Minister In
Washington, made a cail upon Assistant
Secretary Taylor ' :Of the United States
Treasury 'Department , and discussed with
that' gentleman the question of Japanese
Immigration to the islands. Some time
ago, when the hue and cry was raised on
the Pacific Coast against admitting the :
Japanese, the Government of Japan issued
an Â¦ edict . forbidding the exodus . from , the
motherland. Now there is a shortage In
the labor market of the coast and espe
cially in ' the Hawaiian Islands. . It is
probable that in view of the . demands
made by the sugar planters the entry of.
Japanese to the islands will be allowed.
The Japanese Minister was informed by
Mr. Taylor that on no account would the
contract system i be . tolerated, in view of
the provisions of the alien labor laws of
the United States, but that If Japanese
sought admission to the country in the or
dinary way: there would be no restrictions
placed upon their entrance. -Â¦ , -
The sugar planters of Hawaii have had
a great deal of trouble lately in obtaining
suitable labor. Many Porto Ricans have
been transported to the islands, but ap
parently they are proving unsatisfactory.
Hon. S. Shimuzu, the Japanese Consul
General here, said to-day that he was
aware from information received that it
was probable the edict would be imme
diately-modified to permit Japanese to
emigrate to Hawaii, but he did not under
stand that any would be allowed to seek
labor in the United States proper.

Mrs. Mills also retired again, but her hus

to dress and go on deck. The boat in

carried only twelve or fifteen persons,

malady, as in that of kidney and bladder
troubles now preying upon the people of
this country.
To-day we see a relative, a friend or an
acquaintance apparently well, and In a
few days we may be grieved to learn of
their serious illness or sudden death,
caused by that fatal type of kidney trou-
bleâ Brlzht's disease.
Kidney trouble often becomes advanced
into acute stages before the afflicted ia
aware of its presence; that is why we
read of so many sudden deaths of promi-
nent business and professional men. phy-
sicians and others. They have neglected,
to sto? the leak in time.
While scientists are puzzling their brains
to find out the cause, each Individual can,
by a little precaution, avoid the chances
of contracting dreaded and dangerous
kidney trouble, or eradicate it completely
from their system if already afflicted.
Many precious lives might have been, and
many more can yet be saved, by paying
attention to the kidneys.
It is the mission of The Call to benefit
its readers at every opportunity and,
therefore, we advise all who have any
symptoms of kidney or bladder trouble to
write to-day to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Blng:-
hamton, N. -T., for a free sample bottlÂ®
of Swamp-Root, the celebrated specific
which is having such a great demand
and remarkable success In the cure of tha
most distressing kidney and bladder
troubles. "With the sample bottle of
Swamp-Root will also be sent free a pam-
phlet and treatise of valuable informa-
tion.

fore the question of superiority was
settled. The winners were Miss Sutton
and McGavin, the score in their favor
being 6-8, 6-1. 6-8. The first set was the
best of the three and was productive or
the most exciting tennis seen here for a
long time. The net work of all four was
superb and called forth great applause
from the spectators. In the last two sets
Miss Sutton and McGavin Steadied down
- and won out rather handily. The features
of the match were the brilliant smashing

volleying of Miss , Sutton. Miss Hoffman

losers played a fine up-hill game and
made a very good showing against their
more skillful opponents. Mis3 Garland
played a remarkably good game in this
match and was fully as clever as Miss
Hall. Whitney was slightly off in his
overhead- work, but his ground strokes
were excellent. . '

SHAMROCK GOES
OUT FOR A SPIN
Yachting / Experts Say
She x ls a Wonder
..â¢ fill Boat.
Most Dangerous Craft That
y*p Has Come Over From
England.
NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â Tbe Shamrock
II was given a good long spin to-day
both inside and outside -the Hook. She
was tried in windward work and broad
and close reaching. In fact the chal
lenger was given everything except a
spinnaker run in a breeze that sometimes
piped up to twelve knots and at no time
was under eight knots. The good opin
ion of her speed, merits and ability to
carry canvas was emphasized. Â¦â¢â¢â¢
Many yachting experts who saw her
performance call her a, wonderful boat.
All say she is the most dangerous vessel
that has ever come over the waters hunt
ing for America's cup. She had life ia
her every movement. She gathers way
with remarkable - rapidity, is quick ia
stays, points high, stands up under a tre
mendous spread of canvas and is a de
cided improvement over the other Sham
rock. The only new sail tried to-day was
her large club topsaiL It was a revela
tion to those who saw it. It appears much
larger than the topsails on the Columbia
ana Constitution. It extends rUrther out
over the gaff and runs up higher above
the topmast. It is said that tne distance
from the- boot of the mast to the top of
the topsail club is over 190 feet. The sail
sheets out very well and there is less
looseness along the head than on either of
the American boats.
Sir Thomas Lipton was on board during
tho entire trial and seemed much pleased
with her showing. "This Is the twentieth
spin which the boat has had," said he,
"including her races on the other side.
She is improving all the time and I am
more pleased with her to-day than ever
before. If she does not carry back the
cup the American boat that beats her
may well inspire pride in your people."
A notable feature of the day was the
constartt saluting which the challenger
received from ocean steamers down, to tha
smallest launches.
Stinson Wins at Boston.
BOSTOX, Aug. 27.â A punctured tire, of
Harry Elkes' wheel was the chief factor
in his defeat by Will Stinson in their
one-hour motor-paced race at Charles

the accident the pace had been very fast
and Stinson made new records from, six
to fourteen miles inclusive. In the hour
Stinson rode 38 miles 1049 yards and
Kikes 38 miles 30 yards. Stinson's time
for 33 miles was 5^:03 2-5. The new rec

Eighty-five men employed in excavating
for the new drydock j at Hunter's Point

The strikers are non-union men, but
they quit mainly out of sympathy with

The Shipowners' Association is an organiza
tion composed of owners and managers of sail
ing vessels and steam schooners, Â¦ all chiefly
engaged in coastwise trade. Its object is "the
protection and Improvement of the shipping in
terests of the Pacific Coast," and it has taken
no active hand In the present controversy as
yet. It has been in existence about eight
years and has devoted its attention mainly to
securing and shipping crews for the vessels
owned by its members â¢ (always avoiding and
prohibiting the charging of shipping fees to
seamen) : to making up accounts for vessels
and paying off crews. During the past five
years no seaman has been asked as â¢ to his
membership or non-membership in the union
and absolutely no discrimination has been
shown between union and non-union sailors
when crews have been employed by the asso
ciation. No opposition to unions or unionism
as such has entered into the work of the as
sociation in the ! past. For more Â¦ than two
years last past there have been no differ
ences affecting tho relations between the as
sociation and the union , excepting one and
that one difference Is the same upon which
the present conflict is being waged i. e the
union demanded and insisted that ho man be
employed upon any vessel who was not a
member of the union, while the association
uniformly refused to be dictated to In that
particular.. The association stands firmly In
the Fame position now upon that proposition
and believes that in doing. so it is right. It
believes that men are men whether they be
members of a union or not and at the same
time it has never denied the right of any man
to belong to a union or refused to- employ
any man because of his membership. R c .

A statement appears to the effect that the
Shipowners' Association had a delegation of
its members or a committee out seeking con
ciliatory methods of ending the strike and
stating, that "the shipowners talked to indi
vidual members of various unions suggesting
the desirability of bringing the strike- to an
end," etc.. etc. There has been confusion
somewhere ; some other organization must be
referred to, because the Shipowners' Associa

of ending the strike by mediation.

Attorney Coffey in his final argument
characterized Koote's speech as a play to
the "gallery" and an appeal to the pas
sions and prejudices of the mob. He said
he had studiously kept himself to the legal
aspect of the case and he denounced
Foote's speech as inflammatory.
The Judge said he was still of the same
mind, but he would read carefully the
authority quoted by Attorney Coffey and
give his decision this morning. He ex
pressed his regret that Foofe had referred
to the remarks made by Captain Witt
man, as it was a matter solely for him
self and had no bearing upon the case.
W. W. Foote, attorney for the prosecu
tion. In his reply, advised the strikers to
arm themselves, and if policemen used
their clubs on them to shoot them. He
characterized the special officers of Cur
tin's detective agency as "hired thugs and
assassins." He denied that a police officer
was clothed with discretion of a judicial
character. He argued that no ground for
a new trial had been advanced. He was
inclined, he said, at first that a nominal
fine Ehould be imposed upon the defend
ant, but after the remarks made by a su
perior officer of the defendant regarding
the Judge's decision he would Insist upon
a severe punishment. If the courts, he
said, would do their duty it would do
more to stop the strife among strikers
and non-union men than anything else.
It was the instructions given the police
men by their superiors that fomented
strife between the strikers and non-strik
ers.
Attorney Joseph Coffey for the defend
ant opened the argument. He said he
asked for a new trial on the ground that
the verdict and decision of the court were
contrary to the law and evidence; also
that the court erred on a question of law,
to which he took exception at the time.
He contended that Maddison refusing to
move on when requested to do so became
a violator of the law. The others had dis
persed when asked to do so and Maddison
alone stood his ground, defying the offi
cer. The police, he claimed, had a right
to use force to suppress riotous conduct,
as they were clothed with discretion of a
judicial character when a riot was, immi
nent. He also argued that the Judge had
erred in not permitting him to produce
evidence of previous riotous conduct on
the part of strikers at the place where the
battery was committed, which was the
reason why the defendant and other offi
cers had been detailed there to protect
life and property, and he quoted a decision
in the Ohio courts to sustain his argu
ment.
The motion for a new trial in the case
of Policeman O. H. Knight, convicted by
Judge Cabaniss on the charge of battery
upon James Maddison. a striker, was ar
gued before the Judge yesterday after
noon, and the Judge reserved his decision
till this morning, although intimating that
he was of the seme mind still. The court
room was crowded with strikers, but no
demonstration was made.

load of lumber was being taken oft by the
captain 'and mate and the two sons of the
owner of the vessel.
Albert Wlnslow, a union man, and Mar
tin Schwartz, a non-union man, were ar
rested on Howard street- by Officer M.
de la Guerra :or disturbing the peace.
Schwartz claimed that he had been at
tacked by several men. one of whom was
Winslow. The latter stated that he saw
Schwartz put his hand. in his hip pocket
as, if to draw a weapon and that he only
grappled with him to prevent a shooting.
Walter Reed, a colored man who ar
rived here recently from Virginia, was ar
rested yesterday afternoon by Officer J.
P. Hlghtower at the corner of East and
Howard; streets and charged at the Har
,bor Police station with assault to mur
'der. In defending himself against an at
tack made on him by four men he drew
a revolver and discharged it at them. The
shot did not take effect. Robert McDon
ald, who, it is alleged, was one of the at
tacking party, claimed that the negro
aimed his revolver at him. Reed claims
that he did not try to hit any one, but
merely fired to one side to scare the men
who were beating him.
Five strikers set upon Andrew Patter
son, a non-union man,' at the corner of
Beale and Folsom streets .early yesterday
morning and beat him so severely that it
was feared that death would ensue. He
was treated at the Harbor Hospital for a
fractured nose, lacerated wounds of the
face and head and numerous contusions
of the body. After having his wounds
dressed he was removed by friends to
the Waldeck Sanatorium. TheÂ»men who
attacked Pattterson lay in wait behind
an immense tank on Beale 'street and
when he had passed jumped on him.

"I was hired In New York by an agent
of the Union Iron Works, who told me
that there had been a strike out here. In
which S00 machinists had quit work. He
told me that the trouble had been settled
and that 200 of the men had returned to
â¢work. The other hundred, he claimed,
Â¦were poor workmen and would not be
taken back, and that men from the East
were wanted to take their places. He
guaranteed me a year's steady work at $3
per day. He paid my way out here and
gave me tl 50 a. day while I was on the
road. I have talked with all the men
â¢who were In the party and I find that the
same proposition had been made to all of
them. I went to the iron works to escape
the trouble and left there as eoon as I
found how matters stood. There are only
Three arrests were made of men who
Â¦were pointed out as leaders of the attack.
but no one appeared at the police station
to make complaint, so they were released.
Nine of the men appeared at the head
quarters of the union machinists last
night. They informed Detectives Rey
nolds and Crockett, who were sent there
to find out if the men were held against
their will, that they came there of their
own accord and intended remaining under
ttvp protection of the union.
Tt'ne of the men who went to the Union
IrÂ£r. Works refused to go to work when
be heard that the labor troubles of the
machinists were not settled. He left the
â¢works and went to the union headquar
ters and Joined the men who came over
land with him. In giving his reasons for
refusing to accept employment at the
works he said:
Elwell was the only one of the party in
jured, though the fight was kept up until
the train reached the mole. The officers
succeeded In getting all the men who had
remained on the car when the attack was
made aboard the ferry-boat, though not
without considerable difficulty. The union
machinists surrounded the men on the
boat and made every effort to reach them.
but they were beaten back by the railroad
police. When the ferry-boat reached this
eide there were only twelve of the twenty
men to be found. Officers Flinn, Smith,
McGrath. and McCormlck took charge of
them when the boat landed and escorted
them to a launch, in which they were
taken to the Union Iron Works.
Fighting 1 on Train and Boat.
Special Officer El well, who was escort
ing the non-union men. attempted to pre
vent the machinists from attacking the
New York men and was roughly handled.
His piftol was taken from him and
enough blows landed on his face and head
to make it necessary for him to go to the
Harbor Emergency Hospital as soon as
he reached this side of the bay.
At Sixteenth -street station the strikers'
committee was reinforced by a number of
union men who evidently had formed
other plans to circumvent the plans of the
shipbuilders. As soon as the train stopped
they proceeded to get to work, and had it
not been for the police officers on duty at
the station they would have accomplished
their ends and prevented by force the en
tire twenty from reaching the Potrero.
The committee met the train bearing
the non-union hands yesterday morning
at Port Costa. When they entered the car
in which the non-union men were travel
in? they immediately set to work to con
vince the New Yorkers that they were
not needed at the Union Iron. Works and
would be much better off if they would
visit the headquarters of the machinists
end join the cause of the strikers. The
were all glib talkers and
Â¦She strangers wcrÂ© all good listeners, 'but
tr.e train reached Sixteenth-street station
without a convert having been made.
Twenty non-union machinists from New
Tork arrived here yesterday morning to
go to work at the Union Iron Works, but
it is not known positively how many suc
ceeded in reaching the scene of their fu
ture employment. That the entire party
did not reach the works was due to the
vigilance of the pickets placed by the
Machinists' Union. Those that did reach
the works reported for work very much
frightened.

"We had a contract which had to be
completed and we had to. secure the ser
vices of non-union piledrivers. When
these men arrived at Hunter's Point about
S5 of the 120 pick and shovelrrien in our
employ quit work. A large number of
them were machinists out on strike who
were working for us for $2 a. day, In
order to make living expenses during tho
strike. They would not work with non
union men, so threw down their picks
and shovels. We do not anticipate any
trouble In getting men to take their
places."
A representative of the City Street Im
provement Company, seen at the office of
the company yesterday, said:
"We have no union and had no inten
tion of striking. We were perfectly sat
islied to work as we were, and only quit
because we were. informed that we would
have to give up our bunks to men who
were taking the places of union hands out
on strike. We got together and after dis
cussing the matter, determined to show
our dislike for non-union men who were
taking the place of strikers and to refuse
to work with them."
their intention to Quit word was sent to
police headquarters for officers, as it was
feared trouble might ensue. Â¦ A regular
officer and several specials were sent to
the Point.-; but their services were not
needed, as the men were orderly. One of
the men who quit said in explaining their
action:
Mr. Scott denied emphatically that any
machinists are being brought to the coast
at the expense of the Union Iron Works.
He stated that every man paid his own
passage and that their trip did not cost
the company a dollar. He likewise denied
the statement that the company was pay
ing newcomers $1 a day in excess of the
schedule of wages which was in force be
fore the strike. The men. he said, were
paid from $2 50 to $3 50, according to merit.
"In addition to these men, twelve others
applied for and were given employment at
the works. This makes a total of twenty
four new men to join our working force
to-day. We are satisfied with the situa
tion."
Henry T. Scott, president of the Union
Iron Works, stated vesterday that the
strikers succeeded in getting only eight of
the twenty machinists.
"The report that they got twelve men
is erroneous." he said. "The actual figure
is eight. I have nothing to say about the
methods employed in converting the new
comers. What the men will do here with
out money is a mystery. The Machinists'
Union ought to send the men back home.
As for the men who resisted the appeals
of the strikers, they are doing well
enough.
Twenty-Four New Men at Work.
three of the twenty men who came from
New York that are working there. I
counted nine of the party here a little
while aco, but do not know where the
rest of them are. There was no contract
made with us. We put our names to noth
ing but a blank piece of paper."
RUMORS of the previous day in
regrard to the strike situation re
ceived little verification In the
events of yesterday. Whatever
foundation there may have been
for reports of a disposition on the part of
several unions to defy the leaders in ths
City Front Federation and return to work
no such, action occurred and the Labor
Council and City Front Federation cin
cials are finding time to devote much at
tention to preparations for the celebration
of Labor day.
The unions now out on strike and the
others affiliated with the Labor Conned
Lvill participate In a monster parade and
r celebration in the city, while the Building
Trades Council will unite with councils
of the same trades from other cities in a
celebration at Shell Mound Park.
The conciliation committee of the Board
of Supervisors held its preliminary meet
ing in the afternoon and discussed the
g-eneral situation and plans to bring about
industrial peace. Another meeting will
probably be held this afternoon.
Longshoremen's Union No. 222 and the
Marine Firemen'* Union held meetings last
night, but neither took action bearing di
rectly on the strike situation or the ru
mored disposition on the part of some of
the members to return to work.

Louvre in French means, palace or mag

louvre being a corruption of lupra, as It
Is called in, the old. title deeds. "Dago
bert," says Brewer, _"there built a hunt
ing box, the nucleus the present pile
of buildings." Alden says that louvre is
derived from the French "l'ouvert," "the
opening," and applied. to. the ornamental
opening often of turret or lantern shape
on a; roof to - allowi smoke or foul
air to escape from large apartments,
such as halls, kitchens and the like. These
were particularly required in ancient
times when the flre was ; placed in the
center of a room and there was no chim
ney to carry off the smoke. As to the
Louvre in Paris, Hayden says: "It is
said, to have been a royal residence in
the reign of Dagobert, 623. It was a prison
tower constructed by Philippe Augustus
in 1204. It afterward became a library
and Charles VI. made it his palace about
1364. Tho new buildings bÂ£gun by Fran

successive Kings, particularly Louis XIV.

The people of cat. Louis, in their eagerness to have

ANSWERS .TO QUERIES.
It is worth noting, by way of giving the devil his
due, that the reason assigned by the Sultan for taking
away the- concession he had' granted to the French
quay company was that the means they have pro
vided for landing and embarking, passengers are in
adequate and dangerous. If that be so he has cer
tainly some right to complain, and if the diplomatic
V/orld be against him, perhaps. the traveling public in
that part of the world may be on his side.
The objection to the act of the Sultan in sending
a mission to China is curious.: When the mission
was announced it was stated that the action had been
taken at the prompting of Russia, but a little later
that was denied and another statement put forth to
the effect that Kaiser William had prompted it. The
matter was not of much moment, for reports from
Hongkong some time ago announced that when the
Turkish mission arrived there it was found that the
Chinese had never heard of Turkey and did not care
anything about the mission. Since the venture was
thus unimportant, it does not appear why. the powers
should object to it unless it be that they have reached
a condition of mind that renders them hostile, to
anything Turkey may do.
That kind of thing was borne with diplomatic pa
tience for a long time, but recently the Sultan actually
paid certain claims of the United States, and since
then European diplomats have been on their mettle,
each trying to obtain payment in advance of the
others. In their rivalry this time, however, there has
been no such antagonism as in former years, and
consequently the French have the sympathy of the
diplomatic world.
The cause of the universal -sympathy among the
diplomats is not hard to find. Nearly every nation in
Europe has some kind of a claim against the Turkish
Government, and not one of them has had any satis
faction. For years the claims have been pressed by
one power after another, and sometimes by two or
three of them at once, but all without avail. The
Sultan, feeling secure in the conviction that the pow
ers would never permit either one of their number
to declare war against him, has met their, demands
with bland promises of future payment, or with de
nials of any debt, and they have had to submit even
when they knew the promises were worth nothing
and the denials were falsehoods. "â¢^ >t
Whether right or wrong in the controversy, and
whether it lead to a fight or another diplomatic deal,
France has the sympathy of all the statesmen of
Europe. A recent dispatch from London said:
"Diplomatic opinion in this city approves the action
of France * toward Turkey," and went on to add:
"The Chancelleries of Europe have been considerably
annoyed by the Sultan's recent efforts to reassert
himself and to shake off the limited control exercised
by Europe over certain parts of his administration.
The Sultan's dispatch of a mission to the Far East
was also displeasing to the great powers. The pow
ers are expected to generally welcome France's
course."
WAR clouds around Constantinople blow up
horn the unknown and after looming above
the Levant for a while blow away again,
almost as fogs come and go in and around San Fran
cisco. Consequently it is hardly worth while to
speculate whether the particular cloud that now
threatens will pass in a day or remafn for a month.
The reports that come from the scene have a pictur
esque variety of affirmation and contradiction. It
seems the French Embassador, M. Constans, has left
the city. That much appears reliable. The rest is'
guesswork. One authority says his going means
war. â¢ Another says he has gone only because the
time has come for him to take a holiday.
TURKEY AND THE POWERS.
Shortly before the adjournment of Parliament Mr.
Chamberlain, replying to a question in the Commons,
said he would not undertake to estimate how much
longer the war would last, and, added, "I have quit
predicting." ... At the present time the British have
something like 200,000 troops in the field, and yet
with all that force they have been unable to head off
the vigorous commandos of the Boers. They have
also found it expedient to diminish their force 7 , and
consequently will 'enter upon the summer campaign
with a smaller number of troops than they had at
the beginning of the winter. Clearly, therefore, Mr.
Chamberlain was wise in making no 'further predic
tions. With all odds against them the undaunted
Boers have a fair prospect of a successful summer
campaign 'and a fighting chance for ultimate victory
should European complications arise which would
endanger Britain at home. . ..;-
The winter in 'South Africa is drawing to a close.
The fighting Boers on the plains and in the hills and
mountains will soon have more favorable weather
for campaigning. Those that have maintained them
selves through the winter will have a good chance to
continue the war for the next six months with much
less difficulty than in the six months that have passed.
On the other hand, the British exposed to the heats
of the African summer to which they are not accli
mated will not profit much by the change. The sum
mer campaign is therefore more likely to be favorable
to the Boers than to the invaders.
It is true that after announcing the receipt of the
letters Kilchener added: "On the other hand, Â» the
surrenders lately have increased considerably." In
that same'dispatch, however, he had' to report. that a
British troop operating with Elliott's column had
been surrounded by a superior force of the burghers
and captured. Evidently the surrenders are not all
on one side.
Even the brief summary given in the telegraphic
dispatches shows that the Boer leaders in their replies
have indulged in no bravado. , Kitchener's report
says: "Have received a long letter from Steyn conr
taining an argumentative statement of the Boer case
and saying he will continue to fight. Also a short
letter from Dewet to the same effect. Botha writes
acknowledging the receipt of my proclamation and
protesting against it, and stating that the Boers'in
tend to go on fighting."
FROM the Boer leaders Lord Kitchener has re
ceived replies to his proclamation calling upon
them to surrender, and has transmitted them to
London. The answers in every case are what the
world expected from such men. With one accord
they announce a determination to go on fighting so
long as the power to fight remains with them. The
end of the struggle is not yet in sight.
THE UNDAUNTED BOERS.
That is a simple statement of the law of responsi
bility. If American labor unions^ were lawful bodies,
as are corporations, they could not void contracts
and inflict injury at will,, acting under the vicious ad
vice of fire-eating .leaders and infamously reckless
newspapers. To the credit of the masses of members
in the unions be it said that they desire to keep their
contracts, but their leaders compel their violation.
Let the unions rise to the dignity of legal responsi
bility. Let them be honorable in observing their
agreements. Let them cease to subordinate . the
skillful workmen to the control of the unskillful.
Let them put in less time harassing their employers
and causing great losses to themselves and the com
munity by strikes that are without reason, and the
apparent antagonism between capital and labor will
disappear. *".', ,
When the labor union system arose in the British
Isles the unions themselves sought legalization by
Parliament, which passed the trades union acts of
1871 and' 1876. Under these acts the unions register
and have the right to hold property. Under these
laws, too, they founded the union stores, making
wholesale purchase of the necessaries of life, and
thereby expanding the purchasing power of their
wages one-third. One of these registered unions
damaged employers by much such a strike as that of
the marine firemen against Goodall, Perkins & j Co.
in this city. The employers sued the union to re
cover the damage inflicted. The case went up on
appeal and was won by the employers. The Lord
Chancellor in moving the appeal said: "In this case
I am content to adopt the judgment of Mr. Justice
Farwell, with which I entirely agree, and I cannot
find any satisfactory answer to that judgment in the
judgments of the Court of Appeals which overruled
it. If the Legislature have created a thing which can
own property, which can employ servants, which can
inflict injury, it must be taken, I think, to have irn*
plied, given power to be suable in the courts of law
for injuries done by its authority and procurance."
If the employer violate his contract his property
must answer in damages. But the union has no re
sponsibility, and as the labor leaders teach that it is
more honorable to break than keep a contract, the
employer cannot depend upon the morality and code
of -honor which governs men everywhere except in
the unions.
of that class from ever advancing by superior skill,
thrift, industry and temperance.
We invite the study of the plan by all men who
see that the' union system must be reformed. Recent
events have infected the management of the labor
leaders with an infirmity which will destroy the
unions unless it is corrected. All business operations
rest upon a contract. The pending strikes here and
in the East develop the fact th'at the unions had con
tracts with the employers of labor, and that these
contracts have been violated by the order of labor
leaders. â¢ This violation has been justified by Presi
dent Shaffer and the leaders here. These contracts
would not be violated if they could" be enforced
against the unions. The leaders know that they are
irresponsible, and show" not even that restraint which
honor puts upon a promise. These violations of con- J
tract are the cause of. refusal of arbitration by em
ployers. What use to arbitrate? An arbitration is
simply to produce a contract, an agreement, between
the union and employers. As the unions have vio
lated past contracts at will, what use to make new
contracts with them, by arbitration or otherwise?
We warn union labor that a fatal blow has been
dealt it, out of its own headquarters. Public opinion
will not tolerate breach of contract in a matter that
involves the welfare of the whole community.
The number of persons who have applied for lodg
ings in New Haven in order to attend the Yale
bicentennial celebration in October is said to have
been- so large that already every available room in the
city has been engaged, and the committee is now
trying to rent steamers to serve as temporary hotels.
Evidently old Yale is going to have a great time, and
if the New Haven people leave the visitors any money
in their pockets there will doubtless be big contri
butions to anything Yale wishes as a permanent
memorial of the occasion.

PERSONAL MENTION.
This organization should settle on and adopt a graded scale
Graded Scale of 'Wages.
A committee should be appointed from said Legislature
through which the business could be conducted. The very fact
that the State Legislature was interesting itself for the amelio
ration of the working^ classes and in harmony with the em
ployer of the same would give confidence and standing to the
proposition. The duties of aaid committee should be to ascer
tain and secure the names of the best mechanics of any par
ticular branch of industry which are now offering or selling
their mechanical skill /and labor. â¢ Secure the names of both
union and non-union men-, then arrange to have them meet and
discuss ways and means and a plan of action to separate them
selves from the lower grades of their own particular kind of
labor and make rules and regulations and adopt' bylaws for
their guidance. Organize into a body to be known- as (for
example) the Classified Carpenters' Union. After being -duly
organized and* officered they should make and adopt a system
of mechanical questions for determining the qualifications of
an applicant. This must be thorough and as near perfect
(without technicalities) as the brain of the mechanic can make
it. When the system of questions is perfected the secretary
should be authorized to send put invitations' to all whom It may
concern with' literature embodying all the tenets upon which
the classification system -was founded and upon -which in the
future the higher class of mechanics would stand and In con
sequence thereof said higher class of mechanics will sever their
connections with all other unions.
Legislative Committee Should Act.
â¢ Let. the State help to unionize all classes of labor, but sys
tematize them- by classification and graded scale of wages.
What a grand outlook for the masters of alKthe industries â
they could safely figure the exact cost of labor and they could
select from any class which would be suitable for their wants.
What satisfaction this would give and what confusion this
would save. Then what a grand arrangement or order of
things this would be for the employed. The higher grades of
labor would conduct the workings of the unions, while now
it is the lower grades which have full control, they being
largely 'in the majority. Under the present conditions there is
no Incentive to become a first-class mechanic or laborer, but
it, is very evident that a great incentive would be~created un
der the classification system. Every man would strive to at
tain more ' knowledge of the business he had adopted so that
he jnay be advanced in the classes. Now in order to accom
plish this a system of procedure must be inaugurated and a
partial outline of my views for its accomplishment Is herein
given. The State Legislature should be appealed to for assist
ance by making an appropriation of money to defray expense
of furnishing literature bearing upon the subject and the dis
tribution of the same which would assist In educating the pub
lic mind as to the feasibility of the classification system.
State Assistance Suggested.
Now this strife should stop and all should lend assistance to
prevent if possible a continuation of this state of affairs; It
certainly can be accomplished and I firmly believe that the
true solution is the separation of all classes of labor and re
organization of the unions upon a classification system. It Is
a well known fact with all. master mechanics. and all master
laborers as well. there are vast differences in the qualifications
of the men under their supervision and it is also, admitted by
all the masters that highly- skilled , mechanics and efficient
laborers aro in the minority. Now I contend that all classes of
laborers should be unionized and therefore I say let them have
their unions, which if carried on systematically would prove
useful and instructive. - ,--
the problem of how to harmonize capital with labor.
This is one of the great questions now" agitating the whole
humanfamily, and it would seem to me an opportune time that
thought along these lines should be made public. The condi
tions as they now exist in San Francisco and elsewhere is
"dog eat dog" and each is waiting for the other to give way.
A very strong argument can be shown 'for both sides that they
are both right, but from my study of the situation I consider
that both sides are radically wrong. . . â¢

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
Greater Power of "Onions.
The unions formed and conducted on this classification sys
tem would have greater power and be more respected than the
unions under the present- regime. Every member under tho
new system would have a standard value for his skill and
labor and there would be an object for him to look forward to
and the dignity of labor would advance.
As to the compensation 'of employes under this system tho
rate for each class should be fixed at a stated price per hour
and the number of hours should be limited to not more than
ten hours according to the character of business, unless by
consent of employes, or in other words, the employer should
not have the power to compel any person to work a greater
number of hours than that which the union had adopted aivff"
the number of hours constituting a day should be subject to
change only at certain periods, say two, four or five years- this
would give stability and safety to the employer and employed
This mode of procedure v/ould make better men and better
mechanics and out of confusion and chaos would come con
tentment and advancement
I will say in conclusion that I am ready at any time to con
fer with any Interested party to assist In putting these views
in practical form and will use every endeavor to harmonize
capital and labor. Respectfully, j. l.. COOKE
San Francisco, Aug. ZL Builders' Association.
There would certainly be great masses of the populace ready
to back either. side and the fight would go on Indefinitely, but
this state of things does not exist; there Is perfect harmony be
tween the manufacturer, producer and the wholesaler and also
harmony between the' wholesaler and the small buyer or store
keper; but if you will take notice the small buyer la subser
vient to a certain extent to the wholesaler, the latter being In
the lead although in the minority, and he has aright to have tho
lead as according to the classification system. he has attained
this prominence by application and study just the same as
skilled and unskilled labor would attain if the first-class me
chanic and laborer shall take the lead and conduct the unions.
A great many of the small storekeepers are satisfied with
their positions and others are reaching but and hope to be
wholesalers at some future time, and so it is with the mechanic
and laborer; some are so constituted that they would be satis
fied in any class, while others would advance even beyond the
unions and become master mechanics, shopkeepers, manufac
turers, etc., etc.
This can only be accomplished by the separation of skl'Jeii
and unskilled labor and by giving control to the higher grades.
Under the conditions and mode of conducting unions to-day
its members are grossly interfering with the interests of the
only source from which they can ever expect to make a suc
cess. Suppose all the large and small firms throughout tho
United States should come together and form unions on the
same basis as the unions of the present day; each class ofH
business would work together and by vote each cla33 would de- '
termine the workings of said unions; the great majority would -
constitute the smaller classes, they being in full power would
vote to cinch the manufacturer and producer and there would
be no end to the trouble. The manufacturer and producer
would have to combine against the small and large dealer and
there would always be contention.
Separation of Labor.
of wages, to be determined upon according: to the actual value
of each class; there being no person more competent to aa
judge the value of said skill and labor than the flrst-clasa
artisan. Under this system the workings of the union would
be entirely under the control of the high grade mechanics or
laborers, Just the same as any other business is conducted;
take for Instance, any mercantile business or any other busi
ness down to the smallest or up to the highest, there Is always
a head that controls all, even to the Government itself, and it
you will carefully sum up the situation you will observe that
the heads of all the successful undertakings have made life
studies of their particular lines they follow and by their in
domitable foresight, skill and energy they have become the
master and they rate their own earning power antix they de
mand an equivalent and they get It. They have a system and
they work faithfully under that system. Why cannot the me
chanics or laborers adopt a system 'upon which they can placo
a salable value for their skill and labor and at the same time
establish themselves on a substantial and harmonious footing
with the purchasers?
Correspondent Believes the Unions Would Then Be -Con ducted by Higher
Grades of Labor, and the Result Would Be Complete Harmony
Between Labor and Capital
Our correspondent proposes to meet this obvious
injustice to skillful mechanics, by reforming the labor
union system, through a classification of mechanics
according to their skill. It is argued that such a sys
tem will give the thorough workman the benefit he
deserves for his superior skill, and will incite the less
thorough to acquire the excellence which will take
them into a higher class and give them higher wages!
While the means for instituting thisplan are highly
artificial, our correspondent's statement of it is very
clear and is, indeed, the most original and sugges
tive proposition that has ever been made since the
union system was used to create a distinct class and,
by reducing all to the same level,, keep the members
'Â¦- - Â¦ â¢" 'Â¦*Â¦ Â¦' - . ' â¢
WE publish a quite thoughtful communication
from a member of the Builders' Association,
inspired by a Call s The writer
sees part of the difficulty which 'inheres in the pres- .
ent union system. He finds that under it a mechanic'
does not depend on his skill and industry for em
ployment, but works or lays off as a majority of his
union decides. He finds that the skillful and the, less
skillful in the same trade are pvtt upon a level and that
the more skillful gains nothing by his expertness,
since his wage is fixed by the union and is the
same as that of the least skillful or the least indus
trious. This is a stumbling-block to personal ambi
tion, and finally measures all handicrafts down to the
level of the least competent. The recent strike of
the painters is an illustration. The strike was for a
uniform wage of $3 50 per day, and all â¢' the men
walked out. Then it was developed that a large'num-.
her of. them were already getting $3 50 per day by
the voluntary act of their employers because they
were skillful, were worth that^wage and got it. But
the majority of less skillful, who were not worth
more than three dollars, controlled the union and
stopped all painting until they got the same wage as
the best.
SUGGESTS AN ELABORATE PLAN FOR REORGANIZING
LABOR UNIONS UPON A CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
The offices at stake arc not of a kind that arouse
much interest ainong the masses of the people, and
consequently it is not likely there will be a big vote
on either side. The State being solidly Republican,
no doubt is felt concerning the outcome of the elec
tion. The only thing, therefore, that attracts atten
tion is the effort that has been made to "virtually
eliminate Democracy and make a really non-partisan
fight against the Republican machine. Under ordin
ary, circumstances such an effort would be hopeless,
but Bryanism has so completely demoralized Democ
racy in Pennsylvania that it is possible a considerable
number of voters may believe it is really out of poli
tics and so be induced to vote for its candidates on
a non-partisan platform. It will be seen that the sit
uation has developed a queer kind of politics, and the
campaign is interesting as a curiosity if for no other
reason.
The. platform says: . "We arraign the Democratic
party as incompetent, incapable, insincere and un
trustworthy.. The citizens of our State within a very
few days have witnessed a spectacle seldom seen in
the history of a political party asking the suffrages
of the people. The Democratic party, ashamed of
its record in the past, and afraid to name a single
issue of a national character on which it is willing to
appeal for support, asks the" people to forget that in
the past when intrusted with the administration of
public affairs it has ruined our business enterprises,
shut down our mills, closed our factories, put in idle
ness" our great laboring classes, ruined credit of the
State and nation, and it now appeals to the public on
what it chooses to call local issues. We condemn
it in the administration of our State affairs as much
as in the incompeteney shown in its administration of
our, national affairs."
at, that.-. -Ttieir resolutions accept the fight on State
issues, but; they deny that it is to be a non-partisan
contest. They assert that, the chief issue is Democ
racy itself..'

Hrs a Valuable Cargt>.
The Panama Railroad and Steamship
Company's Argyll takes away one of the
most valuable cargoes that has left here
for New York via Panama in many a day.
She has been delayed somewhat owing to
the strike, but, nevertheless, all .the
freight scheduled for her has been got
aboard. The cargo consists in part of
large shipments of wool, prunes, peas, old
metal, lumber, copper matte, cattle hair,
beans, bone black and barley. The whole
is valued at over $150,000. The barley de
tained the vessel, as it had to be landed
at the seawall and then, loaded into the
steamship.
She Is Homeward Bound From Man-
ila via the Hawaiian Islands.
The Solace is expected here from the
Philippines, via Honolulu, to-day. She
will probably be laid up for repairs, as the
war being now over, the Government has
no use for a transport. The Solace
has been in commission ever since the

HO GREASE OR DANGEROUS DRUGS
In "Herpicide," the New Scientific
and Successful Dandruff Treatment.
Have you dandruff? Then you have a
contagious" parasite "disease, unpleasant,
unhealthy and one that will eventually
lead to baldness. To cure it you must de-
stroy the parasite that eats at the root of
the hair. *The only preparation for de-
stroying these germs is Newbro's Herpi-
cide. Charles .Klein of Laramle, Wyo.,
says: "Herpicide allayed the itching,
cured the dandruff and stopped my hair's
falling out; and it is bringing a new crop
of hair." Herpicide is free from grease
or dangerous drugs, and makes hair glos-
sy' and soft as silk. One bottle will con-
vince you of its meritu.

that the scarcity and high prices of feed in the

market may become oversupplied In conse
quence. . Thus far, however, no change In the

the rumor of a fresh war loan. The American
stocks remained hard, but without support
until the New York opening, when, on profit
taking, Chicago. Milwaukee and St. Paul de
veloped strength, spurting upward %. The
general list, however, was not responsive.
After the market's close there was an attempt
to rally stocks on the curb, but they relapsed,
closing near the bottom.

NEW YORK. Aug. 27.â Prices of stocks were
toppled over to-day and the recently prevailing
bull movement apparently came to an end.
The hesitating tone which developed yesterday
continued this morning. After the first reces
sion In prices strenuous efforts were made to
check the reaction, which met with a degree of
success. The character of the buying in St.
Paul was a large influence for a temporary
upturn of the markets. Very large lots of this
stock were taken by brokers supposed to act
for the group of financiers which has been
foremoEt in forwarding projects for the com
munity of interest in railroad ownership. Op
erations toward supporting the market else
where were attributed to the most conspicuous
operator on the street and the . apparent con
fidence with which they were conducted served
to intimidate the professional operators of a
smaller class, who were inclined to take a
bearish view of the market. But when this
latter class detected the diminution of the
outside buying through commission-houses and
some evidence of profit-taking by the longs
they offered stocks down boldly and by un
covering stop-loss orders dislodged very- heavy
offerings, under which the market broke badly.
With the downward tendency established the
traders gave a pessimistic twist to the cur
rent news, as is their wont. There was, how
ever, little news to account for the course of
the market. The inference was clearly justi
fied that the buying and bidding, which for
two weeks past represented an experiment by
stock market operators who hoped to attract
a sufficient outside interest by this means to
make an active bull speculation. Yesterday's
extremely moderate demand from outside
sources chilled the expectation of the bulls and
what long lines had not been sold to realize
profits were forced to sale more urgently to
day with the still further diminution in the
outside demand. Naturally the stocks which
had been recently ! bulled the most were the
weakest on the reaction, the Pacifies, Atchison,
Amalgamated Copper, Norfolk and Western
and the coalers suffering the widest declines.
Yesterday's story of a settlement of the steel
strike was clearly shown this morning to have
been put out to hold the market and the steel
stocks .dropped with the rest of the market
and are V& lower for the day. The rally in
the corn market was also an influence and
there was a renewed selling from Western
sources, which have been covering in stocks
during the period of reaction in corn. The
most potent influence in checking the specula
tion for the advance was the growing convic
tion that requirements to move the crisis must
be met to a large extent by the New York
money market, with the prospect of a con
tinued drain at the game time on account of
United States treasury operations. There was
no striking development to-day to emphasize
this conviction, but the factors recently at
work to that end continue in force. The mar
ket had substantial rallies from its break,
caused by short covering, but the recoveries
were not well held and the closing was fever
ish, with a heavy undertone.
The railroad bond market continued quite
active, but turned weak in sympathy with
stocks. Central Georgia issues were strong
on the declaration of the full interest on the
income bonds. Total sales, $1,715,000.
' United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.
New York Stock Market.
California Fruit Sales.
The market for fruit stands about the same.
The demand for the East is as lively as ever,
though the first rush for Apricots Is over and
Peaches are taking their turn.. Prunes will
come next and are already coming to the front.
Each fruit takes its turn, according to Its
time of appearance In the market. The mar
ket for everything In the fruit line shows as
much firmness as ever. There is nothing doing
in Raisins, as the season has not yet opened.
Nuts are steady and there is a fair demand for
Honey, without any particular activity.
, As has already been mentioned in the press
dispatches the prune packers will operate in
dependently of the Cured Fruit Association this
year. It is now stated that the packers have
secured most of the raw Prunes in the Santa
Clara Valley. The Prune crop is so light and
the demand promises to be so good that there
is little danger of any serious results to grow
ers through the separation of the two com
binations.

this fallâ one Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court and two Regents of the Uni
versity of Nebraska. The contest for first
place on the ticket has been at no time
exciting. Among the active aspirants for
the nomination of the Supreme Court Jus
tice are S. P. Davidson of Johnson Coun
ty, W. H. Sedgwlck of York, AV. W. Key
ser of Douglas, C. T. Dickinson of Burr,
J. B. Barnes of Madison, E. C. Calkins of
Buffalo and District Judge H. M. Grimes
of Lincoln County. For Regents of the
university only one name has been prom
inently mentioned thus far, that of Carl
J. Ernst of this city. â¢
The platform will strongly indorse the
acts of the national administration and
congratulate the party in Nebraska on Us
victory last November. The administra
tion of Governor Savage will probably be
commended, though a, resolution may be
introduced censuring him for the pa
role from the penitentiary of former State
Treasurer Bartley. This is the only ques
tion likely to disturb the harmony of the
convention.

For a minute. In his zeal to find out
about the law-breaking, the policeman did
not see the loving couple. Davis pointed
to the crowd which was congregating and
to the couple. 'The officer approached the
two and spoke to them. With mischief in
her eyes the young woman nestled close
to the paternal looking policeman and
began to plead with him.<
"Why, officer, teach not your, lips such
scorn. They were not made for such con
tempt, .but rather for kissing," she sug
gested.
' "What do you mean by this scandal
here?" said Policeman O'Donaghue.
"Why, officer, you can't blame us,",
-urged the young wife. "You used to kisd
yourself and may be you do yet,"
"Well, you have no right to tempt oth
ers even an' old bachelor," said the officer.
"See these people looking at you."
Before the officer could stop him Ray
mond planted a loud smack on his wife's
cheek and the crowd cheeredr
"If you promise to keep off my beat and
get right away from here I will, let you
go " said Policeman O'Donaghue, "but if
you break that rule I will lock you up.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 27.â It is feared in,
official circles here that the withdrawal oC
the French Embassadcr from Constanti
nople marks the dissolution of the concert
of European powers under which the in
tegrity of Turkey. wa3 guaranteed. By
the treaty of Berlin all the great powers
of Europe subscribed to an agreement to
refrain from any act that would tend to
the destruction of the Ottoman empire.
This action was taken to forestall what
1 were conceived to be the designs of Rus
sia, to seize on Turkish territory, and Rus
sia herself wa3 led to subscribe to thÂ»
agreement by force of circumstances. Al
though several times severely strained,
notably by such events as the last war
between Turkey and Greece, thi3 pact has
jso far endured without amendment, but
It is apprehended now that If the action
of France is carried out to the extreme In
dicated in the dispatches each of the other
signatory powers will feel obliged in self
protection to disregard the agreement and
press upon Turkey the vast financial and
other claims that have accumulated in.
the past quarter of a century, with a re
sult of disrupting the present Turkish
Government^ , - I
May IDissolve the Concert.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Aug. 26.â The fol
lowing was the position of affairs Imme
diately preceding the departure of the
French Embassador, -M. Constans:
The Turkish Government was showing a.
disposition to regard the French demands
as settled by the irade relating to thÂ»
quays and the Albanian land seizures. Tho
French embassy, in order to prevent a.
misunderstanding, wrote to Tewflk Pa
sha, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, yes
terday that\France, in addition, expected
the settlement of two other claims in
cluded in the demands made August 11.
and that unless they were conceded be
fore noon M. Constans would leave and
Munir Bey, the Turkish Embassador to>
France, would receive hi3 passports.. In
stead of yielding the Turkish Government
asked for twenty-four hours* delay ana
made alternative propositions, which were,
so unacceptable that M. Constans did not
reply to them. â¢
Turkey Still Evasive.
The correspondent, was Informed to-day
from the best source that the departure
of M. Constans from Constantinople in
the circumstances is tantamount to a.
partial rupture of Franco-Turkish rela
tions. Munir Bey, who is in Switzerland,
will be informed, as set forth in the semi
official note issued this morning, that thÂ»
French Government does not desire him, .
to return to Paris. The current affairs
of the two embassies can be carried on by
the charges d'affaif es, but all negotiations
of a political nature will be entirely sus
pended until the Sultan yields to the-
French demands. The French Govern
ment holds that the Sultan has broken his
word. He had promised full payment of.
the long-standing indemnities to thft
Frenchmen, amounting to 12,000.000 francs,
but at the end of last week de
clined to pay the full amount and of
fered a reduced sum, which was refused,
by M. Constans, who waited until yester
day and then departed. The Sultan.oiad^
a final attempt to induce him. to stay.
M. Constans had left Therapia on board
the Vautour for Stamboul, where he was
to take the Orient exoress. A court cham
berlain arrived at Stamboul in post hasto
from the Sultan begging M. Constans ti>
return to Therapia and promising that
everything would be satisfactorily set
vtled. M. Constans declined to return, de
claring the time for promises was past
'and that it was for the Sultan to fulfill
his undertakings.
1 The French Government will take no
further steps in the matter, but will wait
for the Sultan to move. It is thought tho
Sultan will not allow the present situation
to last very long.
"With the departure of M. Constans thÂ©
relations between France and Turkey
may be regarded as broken off. Munir
BÂ«>y, the Turkish Embassador to France,
has been telegraphed to not return to
Paris.
Relations Broken Off.
PARIS, Aug. 27.â A semi-official note
has been issued announcing that the
Porte, not having carried out its under
takings with regard to the disputed ques
tions between the French and Ottoman}
Governments, M. Constans, the French
Embassador, acting under instructions
from the Foreign Minister of France, left.
Constantinople August 26, the date named
in his. last communication to the Porto
on the subject.
An arrangement had been effected Au
gust 17 and its terms drafted by the Otto
man Foreign Minister, with the approval
of the Sultan, who had promised M. Con
stans that the text should be handed to
him August IS.
M. Constans telegraphed to Paris Au
gust 19 that none of the promises had
been fulfilled, and M. Delcasse, Minister
of Foreign Affairs, on August 21 tele
graphed M. Constans that in view of su
nagrant a disregard of "the undertakings
the negotiations could no longer be con
tinued and requested M. Constans to in
form the Porte that he had received cy
ders to leave Constantinople.
On August 23 M. Constans communicated;

date of his departure, and as the engage
ments were still unkept M. Constans left

Thrasher was the son of Captain Luther
A. Thrasher, Internal Revenue Agent at
Milwaukee. Friends of the deceased tele
graphed the sad news to Thrasher's
parents. It is probable that the body will
be sent East for. interment.
It is supposed that Thrasher committed
suicide while suffering ( from an acute
attack of melancholia. The guests of the
Gait House were startled by the report of
a pistol about 8 o'clock last night and J.
F. Sweeney, the proprietor of the place,
broke Into Thrasher's room. The un
fortunate young man was lying on the
bed, with a revolver tightly clutched in
his right hand end a gaping wound in his
head. ' Â¦ Â¦ Â¦*
Thrasher left two letters addressed to
Collector J. C. Lynch. He was considered
a capable official, and Collector Lynch
stated last evening that he was to have
been promoted on the first of next month.
He was scheduled for duty at Fresno
during the sweet wine season.
Thrasher was on duty at the Morgue at
the time and read the sad news of his
sweetheart's death on the cold and formal
official blank. To him fell the task of
writing her obituary. After her death he
was a changed man. He retired from the
Journalistic field and secured a position
as a gauger in the internal revenue ser
vice. He appeared to take but little inter
est in life and mourned over the loss of
the girl he had hoped some day to make
his wife.
Thrasher came from Kansas, where he
was graduated from the State University.
"While there he fell In love with a beauti
ful girl and she returned his affection. He
came to San Francisco shortly after his
graduation and secured a position as a
newspaper reporter. He was assigned to
the Morgue detail. A few months later
his betrothed paid a visit to this city. She
was suffering from an attack of la grippe
and, becoming mentally unbalanced
through sickness, committed suicide.

On ( the 30th day of July, 1900, two written
agreements were entered into : between the
plaintiffs, their- attorneys, Sullivan, ten or
more of the plaintiffs' fellow-snipers ? on the
claim and a stranger named Kd Young, where
by these parties agreed to "render any aid and
services in their power to . assist" the plain
tiffs and their attorneys in any action or pro
ceeding for recovering the mine. Sullivan sub
sequently, by affidavit, stated that Young, who
was to have one-seventh of whatever was se
cured, represented Ryan, who "would swear
that' he never properly located said claim."
Sullivan proceeds: "In the fore ' part of Au
gust, 1900, affiant met the said James E. Fen
ton in front of what was then the Mint sa
loon on Front street In the town of Nome, and
that the said James E. Fenton thereupon stated
to said affiant that in order to win said claim
it would be necessary to give one Alexander
McKenzie, who had spent lots of money to get
the Hon. Arthur H. Noyes appointed Judge
of the District Court for the district of
Alaska, Second Division, and who controlled
the said Arthur H. Noyes, and who was him
self really the court, an interest in the said
claim, and that it would be undesirable and
ill-advised to give ' the said interest , to said
Alexander McKenzie directly, and as the said
Alexander McKenzie -would not receive . the in
terest directly that it would be proper and
convenient to give the said Interest to I one
Captain McCormick. who was a friend of sthe
said Alexander McKenzie and who would hold
the said Interest in trust for the said McKenzie
and look after the interest of the said j Mc-
Kenzie at Topkuk, and that the interest which
the said McKenzie demanded in said claim was
a one-third interest." Sullivan and the O'Don
nells at first refused, but finally yielded,: and a
deed was executed "wherein .the sal* James
E. Fenton, H. E. Sheilds, Samuel-. Word, P.
C. O'Donnell, J. J. O'Donnell, Ed Young and
affiant conveyed to one Captain , McCormick,
who it was understood by all parties thereto
was holding as trustee for said Alexander Mc-
Kenzie, an undivided one-third Interest ln and
An Interest for McKenzie.
On the 13th of August William B. â¢Cameron,
who selected DuiBose as his attorney, was ap
pointed receiver, with instructions to proceed
to work the claim- and 1 extract its gold, "under
the orders of this court." His '.bond was fixed
at $10, COO, and is of doubtful efficiency. One
of the two bondsmen is M. L,. McCormick, the
general business manager of the corporation of
which McKenzie is, the president.
A Mr. Mclntyre also at about the same time
stated that Mr. McKenzie had asked ( him to
take charge of the property under . him as re
ceiver and . he had declined. â¢ Â¦ :
A day or two after the hearing, and before
the Judge had publicly passed upon the mat
ter. Alexander McKenzie told J. W. Griffin,
a prominent and reputable citizen, that he had
been requested to accept the appointment of
receiver of the mine, and asked Mr. Griffin to
take charge of the property under him, as he
was too busy to look after It personally. Mr.
Griffin, declined, but said he would like the
appointment himself in case Mr. McKenzie
should find himself unable to take the office.
The latter then referred him to Judge Noyes.
Mr. - Griffin called on Judge â¢ Noyes, told him
of his conversation with McKenzie and asked
for the appointment. Â¦ After some talk the
Judge said: "I would like to appoint you. Tou
go to McKenzie and see if you can't bring that
about." Mr. Griffin saw Mr. McKenzie and
told him what the Judge had said. "That,"
says Mr. Griffin,, "was the last I heard of it
until I learned that Cameron had been ap
pointed receiver."
The plaintiffs' claim of "probable right" was
obviously absurd, and as the defendants were
not attempting to mine the claim, and on the
hearing agreed to Interpose no objection to the
granting of an Injunction against them, and
offered to obligate themselves to do or permit
no mining operations until the determination of
the cause, all possible danger of loss or injury
was eliminated.
"Works Mine Under Court Order.
By the Alaska Code of Civil Procedure,
section 753, it is provided that a receiver may
be appointed "provisionally, before Judgment,
on the application of either party, when his
right to the property >which is the subject of
the action or proceeding-, and which is in
the possession of the adverse party, is prob
able, and the property and Us rents or profits
are in danger of being lost or materially in
jured or impaired."
llvan's affidavit was unimportant. The O'Oon
nells and Gordan made oaths unequivocally
to the statements that on the 6th day of
July, at the time of the plaintiff's alleged lo
cation, the claim was vacant and unoccupied,
and subject to location; that prior to that
date no : discovery of geld had ever been made
on the claim, and that upon making th*e lo
cation they had entered into possession and
had remained in the uninterrupted, peaceable
and . quiet possession of the claim until dis
possessed by the military authorities on July
10. The verified answer and the affidavits
filed in opposition to the application for the
appointment of a receiver set forth the facts
of defendants' long-continued, uninterrupted
and notorious possession, defendants' title,
the fact thai; on the very day of their al
leged location and on many days prior and
subsequent thereto the plaintiffs had been
trespassing upon and systematically robbing
the claim, and further showed that the de
fendants had never done more than prospect
work on the property. None of these state
ments of fact were denied.

1900, and ln connection therewith filed â¢ affi

(Jordan, a half-breed. Judge Noyes disre
uardPd Ryan's affidavit, ln which he attempt
ed to discredit the title he had sold. Sul-
Swear the Claim "Was Vacant.
After the departure of Judge Noyes for St.
Michael the attorneys for the Black Chief
Mining Company learned that J. J. and P.
C. O'Donnell, Standish Sullivan and C. B.
Swift asserted claims to the property, and
on the return of the Judge applied to him
for an order permitting an amendment to
their complaint ln the first suit by the ad
dition of the names of these persons as par
ties defendant and providing that the injunc
tion already issued should. If served, be bind
ing upon them. The Judge signed the order.
After signing, however, he. at the instance
of Mr. Ifenton, who acknowledeged that he
was not ln any way connected with the case,
erased so much of the order as provided that
the injunction should apply to the newly
named defendants. No further proceedings
were ever taken In that cause.
On the 26th of July Captain Hansen. one of
the plaintiffs, met Judge Noyes at St. Michael.
The following account of the Interview and the
events immediately following are taken from
a memorandum made by Mr. Dunham on July
SO. Captain Hansen told the Judge that he was
interested in this claim, and asked him what
could be done to protect its owners. Judge
Noyes said. "Mr. Wheeler, my private secre
tary, is going to practice law, and I advise you
to speak to him about the matter." Captain
Hansen reported this conversation to Mr. Sam
C. Dunham, another of the plaintiffs, and to
gether they called on Wheeler at apartments
occupied by himself and Judge Noyes in the
North American Transportation and Trading
Company's hotel. Wheeler said he would ar
range matters to the satisfaction of his visit
ors in twenty-four hours in consideration of a
half-interest in the ; claim. This proposition
was at once declined. Wheeler retired from the
room and soon returned, and offered to render
the required service for a three-tenths Inter
est. Xo bargain was concluded. The case
went to contest. Wheeler, however, repeatedly
spoke to Captain Hansen about the matter,
and on the 21st day of August. 1900. handed
him a proposed agreement between himself and
the Black Chief Mining Company whereby
he was to take charge of the litigation on
behalf of the company, and, if succespful,
receive an eighth Interest ln the company's
stock and property. That agreement never
was signed. Some time later the draft of
that agreement was discovered in a short
hand notebook containing correspondence dic
tated by Judge Noyes to Wheeler. Judge
Noyes. from the bench, .demanded from W.
H. Meteon the return of this book, stat
ing that it was his own property.
August 2 J. J. and P. C. O'Donnell com
menced an action against the Black Chief

On the 17th of September defendants filed
an affidavit setting forth the fact that the
receiver had extracted from the claim gold
greatly exceeding in value the amount of the
bond, and. ln connection therewith, a motion
for an .order increasing the amount of the
bond to $50,000. In an affidavit filed on the
12th the receiver stated that he had extracted
and had on hand more than $10,000 worth of
gold. The motion was argued and submitted,
and although defendants' attorneys frequently
and persistently urged the Judge to pass upon
the matter he could not be Induced to give a
decision, and he never did it. â¢ â¢â¢
Jury Censured by U"oyes.
In November. 1900, the case was tried before
a Jury, and District Attorney Wood, Commis
sioner Stevens and Dudley DuBose appeared as
counsel for the plaintiffs, with the other attor
neys named. Mr. F. E. Daggett, one of the
proprietors of the Golden Gate Hotel, was a
member of the Jury, and he states that Judge
Noyes' charge was understood by the Jury to
amount almost to an instruction to find for
the plaintiffs; and when the jury came into
court and announced that they were unable to
agree the Judge sharply censured them for
failing to find a verdict for plaintiffs. These
statements of Mr. Daggett are corroborated by
another Juror, Mr. Moses Rosencranz, and by
many of the other persons present at the pro
ceedings, is
Upon the first trial the Jury stood four for the
plaintiffs and eight for defendants. In Febru
ary, 1901, a second trial was had with a similar
result, the Jury standing two for plaintiffs and
ten for defendants.
After the close of the second trial defendants
applied to the court for en order removing the
receiver, on the ground, chiefly, that the result
of the two trials had removed all probability
of plaintiffs' right or ultimate success; and the
order was granted, and the receiver instructed
to render a report within a time specified. He
failed to do so. and It was only after repeated
applications to the court and repeated failures
on his part to comply with the court's reiter
ated instructions, and a citation for contempt in
the premises, that his report was forthcoming
The receiver's report was referred to T. P.
Ryan Esq. for settlement. A large amount of
testimony was taken, and the matter thorough
ly investigated; and on the 7th of August 1901
the referee filed his report. The report shows
gross mismanagement, reckless expenditures
unmlner-like operations, utter disregard of the
court's Instructions, and wasteful, injurious
and dishonest methods on the part of the re
celver from the beginning to the end of his
proceedings. The referee finds that he has not
accounted for one-third of the gold extracted
from the claim, disallows a large proportion
of his charges and expenditures, and finds him
indebted to the mine in a large sumâ the exact
amount is not determined, but it is in the
neighborhood of seventy thousand dollarsâ al
though the accounts of the receiver show that
all the gold extracted has been expended, and
an outstanding Indebtedness of some eight thou
sand dollars. .

well known In San Francisco, where he

the claim and to shovel dirt from the lat
ter into their, own sluice boxes. â¢
On tho 6th of September an affidavit of de
fendant, SamC. Dunham, was filed, wherein
It was stated that the receiver had refused
permission to defendants - to be present at the
clean-ups on the claim, and thereupon the Judge
made an order directing that one of the de
fendants, or his appointee. - "be permitted to be
present at' each clean-up and weighing of the
gold taken from the mining claim in contro
versy while said claim shall be ln the hands
of the receiver." At the time of the presen
tation of this order to the Judgo for signing
Mr. Fenton protested, but Judge Noyes. said
with emphasis that he should sign the order,
that In all cases all parties Interested had an
unquestionable right to keep a watch at all
times on the operations of a receiver. On the
10th of September, at the solicitation of plaint
iffs . attorneys, this order was so modified as
to provide that one : only, of . the defendants.
Paul Kjegstad. and one only of the plaintiffs.
J. J. O Donnell, ' "should have the right to be
present together at the clean-ups made by tha
receiver | working said , claim and witness '. the
weighing of the gold so taken out. : provided,
that such inspection by said - representatives
shall , not embarrass , or - inconvenience - the re
ceiver or in any way interfere with the opera
tions of said : receiver." Inasmuch . as the
operation of cleaning up was being conducted
incessantly.- night and day. as subsequently
testified by the' receiver, this modified order
afforded little protection - to either party.
When . defendant .-, Kjegstad ' presented himself
at the claim and proposed to inspect the clean-
v ps h Â« 'was' told that the order provided that
he and O Donnell were permitted to be pres
ent together, and as tha latter was not on tho
Tills proposition, and' the motion, were vig
orously opposed by plaintiffs' counsel. 1 1 In fact
plaintiffs' counsel appeared 'on behalf of â¢ the
receiver throughout the proceedings In the
case, up to the time of his discharge except
for a short period from and after the 12th of
September, 1M)O, .when Mr. Wbeeler, the Judge's
private secretary,- was of record and acted
as the receiver's attorney. On the 10th of
September the application for the removal' of
the receiver was denied. â¢ Â¦ v
Inspection of Clean-Up Refused.
One of the affidavits filed by defendants upon
this motion was that of Captain J. B. Hansen,
wherein is contained the following: "That
affiant and his co-defendants are solvent and
responsible, and if said receiver shall be re
moved and defendants reinvested with posses
sion and control of said mining claim said de
fendants stand ready and willing to. present
and file herein an undertaking in a sum double
the amount required of and filed by said re
ceiver, or in any larger 'amount which may by
the Judge of said court be required, "^conditioned
that said defendants shall proceed to mine said
claim in a systematic and . scientific manner
and by approved and scientific methods, and
keep true and detailed accounts of the ex
penses attending such operations and the re
turns resulting therefrom, and. if required,
periodically report to said court or the Judge
thereof their said operations and the expense,
returns and details thereof." Three days later
and before the conclusion of the hearing on
the motion Captain Hansen made another affi
davit, which was duly filed, in which, on be
half of defendants, he agreed, in addition, to
â¢turn over to said court all the gold which
they shall take from the said claim as the
same is extracted; and further, if the court
or the Judge thereof shall . â¢ so . require, de
fendants will sustain' the entire . expense of
operating and extracting gold frpm said claim
and consent that all the gold extracted there
rrom shall be and remain in the care and cus
tody of said court until the final determina
tion of this cause, and should plaintiffs ulti
mately recover Judgment In said cause in this
court and the court or courts to which the
same may be appealed, plaintiff j shall take
and own the entire amount or quantity of gold
so remaining in. the custody of said court,
free from any and all claims on the part of
defendants for expenses incurred in operating
said claim and extracting the gold there
from. . ..
Immediately upon his appointment the re
ceiver leased from McCormick, at an extrava
gant price â $30 per day â an enormous plant of
machinery, of much greater capacity than was
required or than could be made available, and
half of which, he says, never was used, and
which the McKenzie corporation owned and
had been operating without success on the sea
beach. This machinery, the receiver states, he
had never seen prior to the time he leased it.
He also purchased from McCormick a large
quantity of supplies, hired some twenty or
more men to assist In loading and unloading
these, contracted for their transportation to
the mineâ sixty milesâ for fifteen hundred dol
larsâall this without Inviting competition 1 or
even making Inquiry in other quarters and
without orders from the court.
On the 24th of August the defendants Inter
posed a motion for an order removing the re
ceiver,- supported by affidavits of a number of
persons wherein it was alleged that he was
conducting operations in a grossly expensive
wasteful and unskillful manner, to the present
and permanent Injury of the property and
threatening its ruin. .The plaintiffs', attorneys

fended Hagan and raised the contention
that the notes, not having been proved
counterfeit, and being the issue of a
State and not /i national bank, did not
fall within the prohibition of Section 5430,
which specifies papers shearing a simili
tude to obligations of the Government.
As the. notes during the lifetime of the
bank did not purport to be and were not
obligations of the Government, the coun

Hagan, Perry and - others, who passed
them off on unsuspecting 'women who
earned a scanty livelihood by conducting
small branch bakeries and candy stores.
Hagan's victims who appeared against
him yesterday were: Mrs. J. "W. Brooks,
bakery, Valencia, near Twenty-fifth
street; Miss Katie Denson, 1019 Valencia;
Mrs. Augusta Gleichwit, bakery, 2439 Cali

Annie Brown, 986 Geary street, hair
dresser; Henry Berriman, 1447 Hyde
street; Mrs. K. B. Hall. 635 Sutter street,
and Miss Vintie Munson, 1515 Polk street.
Bills of $1 and $2 each were passed upon
the witnesses by Hagan, whose purchases
rarely exceeded 25 cents in each case. Mrs.
Gleichwit was tendered a ?5 bill on a
50 cent purchase, and the woman, not
liking the looks of it, consulted her hus
band, who assured her that It was
genuine, and Hagan was handed $4 50
change in good silver coin. Mr. Gleichwit,
in consequence, spent several unpleasant
half hours with his spouse, and he now
assures . his friends that his wife Is a
better business "man" than he.

he had been requested by Judge Noyes to say
that he intended leaving for Et. Michael at 6

once institute a suit he would grant an In
junction against all parties who should be
named as defendants. The necessary papers
were hurriedly drafted and all the "enlpers"
whof* names were at that time known, and
others sued by fictitious names, were made de
fendants, and the Judge signed an injunction.
Discovery Claim, or Ko. 1. on Daniels Creek,
in the Topkuk Mining District, near Nome.
Alaska, was located in December, 1899, by one
George Kyan, and his certificate of location
was duly recorded. In the spring of 1S0O the
claim was relocated by William Hunter, who
purchased Ryan's interest and rights, re
etaked the claim, and with his co-owners
formed an association called the Black Chief
Mining Company, and these owners from that
time forward were in the actual possession
and occupation of the property until possession
was taken by a receiver appointed by the
United Suites District Court.
The claim was a rich one, and ln May 1900
thieves or "snipers" as they are locally term
ed, in large numbers, commenced robbing it.
"Warrants for their arrest were issued by
three United States Commissioners at Nome
and placed Jn the hands of as many dep
uty marshals for service, but in each
case the officers refused to act and none of
these were served. In July General Randall
â¢was appealed to and made acquainted with
the facts, and oa the 10th of that month he
sent a detachment of troops to the scene, who
oust*d tho "snipers" and remained on guard
until the arrival ln Nome of Judge Noyes.
Among the claim robbers thus driven from the
mine were John J. O'Donnell. P. C. O'Donnell
and Standish Sullivan

That affiant In consequence of the statements
of said DuBose. and not wishing to enter into

The said DuBose stated further that he un
derstood that I represented a large amount of
Eastern capital and that I was wasting my
time standing in with the other Bide (meaning
those who were unfriendly to the court and to
himself. DuBose), and that if after this prelim
inary deal -was adjusted I would stand ln with
his crowd that we could probably frame up
some arrangement together by which we could
Ko for the whole of the creek (meaning Alder
Creek).
That eaid DuBose on that occasion and sev
eral subsequent occasions stated to me the fol
lowing: That he controlled three witnesses in
said case who would testify in any way that he
directed; that as he and Commissioner Stevens
represented McKenzie he was ln a position to
handle the court and it would be to my Interest
to etand in with him; that in the event of my
not standing; in with him he would undertake
to promise me that I would not get a decision
this summer. That he, for a certain interest
in raid claim that was left to me to suggest,
and which suggestion was first to be submitted
to his associates, would guarantee me a deci
sion before the 1st of April. 1901. That said
DuBose said in the event of my refusing to
divide with him he was going to Mr. Key i*ltt

one of the defendants, with the same proposi
tion and would use his witnesses and influence
on the side of the defendants in the case. He

filling his side of the bargain and he referred
to the Daniels Creek case as an illustration of
his power, saying that his side never had any

already succeeded in buying up two juries and
would go on doing so indefinitely as long as the
present state of affairs existed.
Claims to Control Witnesses.

Harper is a most trustworthy man. The
claim referred to is reported to be very

at Nome, having first met him in the summer
of 1SC0. That some time in the month of Janu

his office in' the town of Nome, at the request
of eaid Dudley DuBoee, and had a conversa

"The receiver will never be appointed,"
said General Barnes, "for Mr. Hancock
will not only obey the order of court, but
in his generosity will do even more for
Mrs. Hancock and his child than the
decree of this court requires him to do."
At this point reference to the famous
Sharon case was dropned and Judge Sea
well continued with the hearing. It was
finally agreed that a provision be inserted
in the decree of divorce permitting Mrs.
Hancock's counsel to apply for the ap
pointment of u receiver to care for her
interests in event Mr. Hancock failed to
obey the order of court and advance her
$300 a month alimeny as ordered by the
court.
"But this case cannot be compared with
the Sharon divorce case," responded Gen
eral Barnes. "We were busy trying that
case for seven months, and furthermore
I was forced to go to court every day
with a law book under each arm and a
six-shooter ln every pocket."
"The fact that you had had experience
as a soldier aided you in those trying
times," added Galpin. â¢
VYes," said Barnes, "If I hadn't been, a
fighter I would have been killed long
ago." â¢ . -. . Â¦ >
"I believe it should," said Mr. Galpin,
"and it is my opinion that the demand is
very reasonable. In fact, if it was not
that General Barnes is representing Mr.
Hancock I would not want a better wit
ness to testify as to the value of the ser
vices I have rendered in this case. I
woUld ask him as to the fee which he was
paid for his services in the Sharon divorce
case. This would furnish material for
comparison." v .--:â¢ -- .---.Â¦
. Judge Seawell remarked that perhaps
the demand was slightly excessive, but at
the same time the vast amount of work
done in the case by Mr. Galpin outside of
court should be considered. â¢Â¦Â¦'..â¢â¢'
