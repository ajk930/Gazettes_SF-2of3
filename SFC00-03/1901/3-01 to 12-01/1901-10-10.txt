It was one of the smartest throngs that
San Francisco has seen in many a day.
The Bishops and visiting clergy looked
splendidly Imposing In the severe black
of their eccleslastlcals, while in the cos
tumes of the women 'there was just
enough suggestion of the pomps and van
ity to make the scene one of brilliant In
terest to the most worldly.
| The crowd problem, which before the
doors were opened, looked- quite serious,
was well solved by a special detail of
policemen in full parade dress. Half a
dozen detectives from the upper office
scanned the ingoing multitude and in spite
of discomfort and' heat the reception will
go' down in the history of .Episcopal con

mansion were at times crowded with mis

pouring stream for the wards the surging
crowd had swept from their care.
Refreshments were served. Only those,
however, who were caught in the . whirl
pool which swirled toward the basement
had any actual knowledge of the fact.
Great care had been exercised in provid

there was neither room nor time to break
more than the most modest kind of a fast.

After the reading of the journal of the
previous Say and its acceptance the chair
man called for reports from committees.
The Rev. Dr. Duncan of Louisiana re
ported for the committee on the state of
the church that It favored good municipal
government and that it urged all members
of the church to aid in the suppression
of evil and vice as tolerated in many
cities. The report was placed on the cal

appreciation of the great mass missionary
meeting of Tuesday night at Mechanics'

tion of the efforts of the Bishops, the deputies

and. which cannot fail to exert an influence.
The Rev. Richard P. Williams of Wash
ington offered a resolution that the House
cf Bishops be requested to elect a Bishop
for the new diocese of the Philippine Isl
ands.
Judge Stiness of Rhode Island objected
to hasty action in the matter and the
resolution was placed on the calendar.
A report of the committee on the gen
eral theological seminary that the dean
of the institution be given a. seat In tha
convention was referred to the committee
on general seminary.
Deputy Charles G. Sanders of Massa
chusetts proposed a change in Article V
of the constitution as adopted on the pre
ceding day by inserting in the provision
for forming new dioceses the words "with
the consent of the General Convention,"
and to make the concluding sentence read
as follows:
When -h phall appear to the satisfaction ' of
the General Convention by a certified copy of
the proceedings and other documents and pa
pers laid before It that all the conditions for
the formation of the new diocese have been
compiled .with, and that it haa- acceded to the
constitution of this church, such new diocese
phall thereupon be admitted to union with the
General Convention.
He "explained that this would restore
the practice to the same condition in
which it is under the present constitu
tion.
The matter was referred to the commit
tee on constitution.
BOSTON SECURES CONVENTION.
J. Pieroont Morgan of New York then
presented the following report, which pro
vides that Boston shall be the meeting

The reverend speaker then quoted a
number of the proposed alterations sug-
The proposal to touch the holy Scriptures al
ways arouses a deep feeling. The early trans
lations were greeted with opposition, and St.
Jerome said: "In vain is a lyre played In the
presence of an ass." The report of the com
mission will be received with all respect and
gratitude. The commission proposes to give
the people the best results of the study of
scholars. Certain verses in the Scriptures are
not to be found in the original record and
some translations are quite incorrect. I think,
however, that the commissioners have made a
mistake in presenting here 'a large number of
corrections and alterations made by them
selves. I am not prepared to accept the
changes made by a small commission. Their
duty was to gather data and not to give ui
their own opinions on certain things.
CRITICIZES TpE COMMISSION.
The Rev. Dr. Greer of New Tork called
for the order of the, day on the marginal
readings and the matter was at once
taken up.
The secretary. Rev. Dr.- Hutchlns, then
read the message received from the House
cf Bishops on the subject of marginal
readings, which was to the effect that the
upper house had adopted the report of the
special committee on marginal readings
and authorized its use by the clergy and
the publication of the Revised Scriptures.
The Rev. Dr. Mann of Missouri dis
cusBed the report of the special committee
and paid a tribute to the magnitude of the
work. He was not in favor of accept
ing the entire report of the commission,
as recommended by that body, and pre
sented the following amendment:
Resolved. That this house concur with men
sage No. 3 of the House of Bishops, amended
so as .to read as follows: Resolved, that the
marginal readings reported to this General Con
vention by the Joint commission appointed In
1895 and reappointed in 1898, to make such re
port In bo far_aÂ» such readings are taken from
the margin of the authorized version, from the
text and margin of the English revised ver
sion and from the text and margin of the Amer
ican revised version are hereby adopted and
allowed for use by the ministers of this church
in the lessons read at morning and evening
prayer.
The proposer of the amendment hoped
that the resolution of the commission
would not prevail. He said:
I hope this house will not accept this Â«ntlra
report on the marginal readings to the Scrip
tures, when it is remembered that the body
has made changes which the original trans
lators, the English revisers and the American
revisers have not made.
The Rev. Dr. McKim â¢ of "Washington
said:
The Rev. Dr. Parks of New York moved
to lay the amendment on the table, which
was done. â¢ . \u25a0.
At this point of the proceedings the
Rev. Dr. Lindsay was obliged to leave the
chair, being called away on business, and
the gavel was placed in the hands of
Judge Stiness of Rhode Island.
A number of motions, resolutions and
amendments were presented at this point,
all relating to the translation of bishops
from missionary districts to organized
dioceses, but the tangle was settled .by re
ferring the entire question back to the
committee on canons.
DISCUSS MARGINAL READINGS.
A resolution by Deputy M. F. Gilbert of
Springfield, that amendments to the
constitution should not take effect until
after the last day of the convention, was
referred to the committee on amend
ments.
A resolution from the committee on elec
tions, recommending that J. H. Cammel of
West Michigan be seated as a deputy in
place of W. R. Shelly, who is absent, was
referred to a committee.
On motion of the Rev. Dr. Alsop of
Long Island the house proceeded to take
up report No. 2 of the committee on
canons, relating to the election and
translation of missionary bishops. The
canon provides that when a missionary
bishop is translated, after five years' ser
vice, to an organized diocese, he shall not
lose jurisdiction of the missionary dis
trict.
The canon was" explained by the Rev.
Dr. Davenport of Tennessee in answer to
questions propounded by the Rev. Dr.
Fulton of Pennsylvania.
A series of cross-questions and answers
between .the two clerical deputies followed
and Deputy George F. Lewis of Iowa
spoke against the adoption of the report.
Lewis moved to amend the report and
have it voted upon in two parts, but this
was ruled out of order by the chair.
The Rev. Dr. Henry of Iowa moved to
add the worts "coadjutor bishop" to the
resolution, thus providing that a co
adjutor bishop be protected equally with a
bishop in the matter of translation from
a missionary district to an organized dio
cese.
touching the securing of a hall for the
meeting and not a church, was referred
to the local committee without recom
mendation.
House of Deputies Aets Favorably on
the Subject After an Inter
esting Debate. ,
MARGINAL READINGS
ARE PARTLY ADOPTED
The Rev. Dr.- Grammer of Southern Virginia
opened the afternoon i debate on the subject,
pleading: for the resolution of the Rev. Dr.
Mann, on four considerations. The first was
esthetic. King James' version had become bo
entrenched In the affections. of the people that
it should not be changed until, the superiority
and necessity of ' the substitution were made
apparent after the most careful study and thor-
The Rev. Dr. Talbot made an amendment to
the motion that a vote be taken at 4 o'clock.
Dr. McConnell accepted the amendment and
it became the original motion. The Rev. Dr.
McKlm of the Washington diocese offered as
an amendment to the amendment that the vote
be taken at 6 o'clock.
A delegate from New Hampshire closed the
subject by making a motion to Icy the whole
matter on the table. It was so voted.
AFTERNOON DEBATE BEGINS.
Upon the House of Deputies reconvening yes
terday afternoon Chairman LJridsay announced
that business before the body was the resump
tion of the discussion of the report on marginal
readings. -
Rev. Dr. McConnell moved that a vote be
taken on the subject at 3:30 p. m. Dr.
Spalding said It was hardly desired to
limit the action or consideration of this
matter, which, he said, â¢ was most impor
tant, and that as it had not come before- the
house before he thought unlimited discussion
should be permitted. The Rev. Dr. Carl E.
Grammer, D.D., of South Virginia followed in
the same vein. He said he was not in favor
of closing: the debate eo soon.
Delegate From New Hampshire
Closes Debate and Matter
Laid on Table.
DISCUSSION ON MARGINAL
READINGS ENDS ABRUPTLY
reading which I hold in my hand acts pre
cisely In that way."
The speaker Illustrated this by the citation
of specific passages, and concluded:
"I submit that, as there is no Angljcan
church and In the American church that it is
a limitation of our .liberty to ask us to take
such a report as this, for apart altogether
from these emendations made by this conven
tion seven-eighths of all the changes made are
simply excerpts from the report of 1SS1 and
1SS5.
He proposed in conclusion the' following sub
stitute for the pending resolution:
Resolved, The House of Bishops concurring,
that the revised version set forth by the con
vocations and the report in A. D. 1881 and A.
D. 1885 is hereby authorized for alternative use
by the ministers of this church for the pub
lic services, of the church.
DEFENDS THE REPORT.
The Rev. Dr. Carey of Albany on behalf of
the commission, of which he Is a member,
spoke at length In defense of the report, giv
ing in -the course of his speech a history of
the commission , and its work, and detailing
the methods pursued by it In arriving at its
result. He pleaded earnestly and forcibly
for the adoption of the report.
Mr. Russell of North Dakota followed and
said In Dart:
It Is accorded to a delegate from a mis
sionary district to have a voice In the deliber
ations of the church. It Is not given to him
to have a vote, however. I come before you
this afternoon as a delegate from North Da
kota, where thlrt" years of my life has been
spent. I come to earnestly ask you gentle
men of the convention to give us these mar-
Sinai references that the commission appoint
ed In '95 has presented to us. I sincerely ap
peal to you that you will accept the decision
of the House; of Bishops and let these mar
ginal references be .adopted, that .they may
be placed in the hands of those people who
are scattered along the prairies and who will
take hold of them with eagerness."
The Rev. Dr. Eccleston of Maryland said:
"No one feels more than I do the need for
some relief where this report proposes to give
it: and yet, feeling deeply that need, and
while sympathizing profoundly with my breth
ren who ask for It, if we are driven to vote
on the first proposition some of us will be
driven to vote against it most unwillingly
It Is because we can vote on the ltne of E>r
Mann's amendment but cannot on the other
that we have asked its consideration. No
one has any more respect for these gentle
men that I; no one wishes to acknowledge
their worth more than I do. No matter what
is done with that report I expect to keep It
in bound form within my reach. I know
many others who will do so. and are glad to
have it. But when It comes to saying that
a matter which required the . careful study
of seventy men. all acknowledged to be ex
perts, for over twenty years, and then to take
the work of men acknowledged to be the best
experts and which did not take three. I Â«ub
mit that our hesitationâ I do not say refusal
is not without ground, to give these men carte
blanche to eo on.
"The expression, 'marginal reading,' is mis.
leading; it is something more than marginal
reading. Who Is ready to say that the text
of the Old Testament is In condition for ex.
perts to come here and ask us to acceot thfir
work blindly, unless they will take the text
of which we have all been talking, the text
on which the revision was made in igsi
known as the Canterbury revision? That u
exactly what we want you to take I Â»JS
you, are you ready to accept not marginal
readings, but textual corrections; it is mnÂ»
confusion." ' un5
Lay Delegate Richard H. Battle of North
Carolina arose to a point of order at this timÂ»
He contended that under the rules of thl
house the substitute offered by the Rev Th-
Crawford, which had been ruled out of nr<w"
was in order. UIuer>
Chairman Lindsay replied that it w a , m.
Intention to permit the resolution to come hi

asked whether the resolution he offered wrmM

answer to the question stated that as a mat
ter of equity it should come before the hoSsl"
that both resolutions would be introdueÂ«A Â»4Vi
li was for the convention to say whether* they
In one respect only would he suggest an
improvement of the work of the commis
sion, the speaker said, viz., by introduc
ing in place of "Lord" and "God" the
word "Jehovah" wherever it flnds its
place in the original. It was, he said,
the word of salvation which was the pivot
upon which the Word of God turns.
The Rev. Dr." Crawford ! of â¢ Virginia
then addressed the house, in part saying:
I heard somebody say that they do not want
a Protestant Episcopal Bible. Well, If tha
Anglican church Is not to produce a new
Bible, I would like to know what church is
to do it.' The Roman church can't do It.
Sixtus VI put upon them the Vulgate and
he put upon them- the anathema If they un
dertook to touch it. There are a thousand
mistakes in the Vulgate, and if any of tho
boys in the form over which I presided had
made those mistakes I. would have caned him.
The Vulgate can't be touched by the Catholic
church. Then who is to give to the church
an amended and batter explanation of the
Bible? Why, the home cf all Biblical learning,
or very nearly all,- Is the Anglican church,
and tha Protestant Kplscopal church - of this
country hai* had no little share in throwing
those illuminations which the textual, critics
One of the great arguments in favor of a
work like this rather than the adoption of
either the Canterbury revision or the Ameri
can revision, lies In this: It was said vet?
fVeely and frequently of the Canterbury revision
when It first came out that It was admirable
for scholars, but it was not good after all for
the common people; admirable as a commen
tary not good for the lectern. I take it that
any company of echolars meeting together to
do a work of this kind must necessarily, to
be honest and true with themselves, bring in
a great many more corrections than any of
them would ever think of reading in public.
I myself certainly have voted for a great many
more of these marginal readings than I should
ever think of using in public reading in church;
nevertheless, I believe it to be my duty in
taking part in a work like this to vote on the
general principle of always voting for what
I believe to be an accurate statement of whal
was really the work of all. ..
On the other hand, in reading the Scriptures
in church. I 'should think it was not â¢ worth
while to use more than a very few of such
passages. My own belief Is that in practical
use if this were .adopted, we should come
very soon to use only a very small portion
of these numerous readings in church at all.
Suppose, for Instance, there are 500 of these
marginal readings marked "C." of which you
disapprove of 400. You don't have to use them.
Suppose, for Instance, you disapprove of the
change from "generation of vipers" to "brood
of vipers," you need not use it in public read
ings in church; if you do approve of it, you
may use It. Is there any harm donet #
FAVORS PROPOSED RESVISIOW.
The Rev. Dr. Hart of Colorado ex
pressed himself as being in favor of ac
cepting the report of the .commission on
the marginal readings. He said:
Somebody here has said he is opposed to
everybody putting out a Bible. I am not.
I use, and it Is the best Bible I know of. one
that was provided by a Plymouth Brpther In
England about fifty years ago.
The Rev. Dr.' Watermann of New
Hampshire, in discussing' the subject,
said:
(rested by the commission and some hilar
ity was caused by the reading. Continu*
ing, the speaker said:
These changes I have quoted were made on
the responsibility of the commission. If the
amendment Is adopted there will be no loss
to the work of the commission. There jviU
be no loss if we read "possessed by.devllB
instead of "possessed by evil spirits"; there
will be no loss if we continue to read 'the
fish's belly" for "the whale's belly".; we shall
not be doing wrong by continuing to read -"cart
down to hell" for "cast down to the under
world." Then again I cannot understand cer
tain Greek translations that have been made.
If we adopt the report of the commission we
shall be introducing a Protestant Episcopal
Bible. I want something more catholic. I hear
that there are many different versions of the
Bible In use. I am opposed to the introduction
into that number of a Protestant Episcopal
one. \
- "I submit that when the version of 1611
was presented to the Anglican church there
was no resolution, no canon, no motion of
uniformity which ever established the author
ity of that version. I further submit that in
asmuch as we are under no obligation what
ever to the use of the authorized version at
the lectern, where It is not definitely, clearly
and precisely the word of God, I submit that
it is an outrage that any priest should be
asked on Christmas morning to read on one
of our two great festivals the worst translated
piece of Hebrew In the whole of the Old Tes
tament. I further submit that Inasmuch as
there Is no authorized I version it is in the
nature of a limitation of liberty that I
should be asked to accept a compromise, which
is the nature of this' marginal reading report:
a compromise which challenges the specific
objection and the only tremendously weighty
objection which lies to the revised version.
The chief objection against the revised \u25a0 ver
sion is simply this: that the most eminent
body of scholars that : the Anglican church
has ever produced did make a (pedal text
for the Greek on which that revised transla
tion Is , based, I submit that this marginal
Chairman Lindsay ruled that Dr. Spalding' s
amendment was not strictly speaking an
amendment to Dr. Crawford's amendment.
'Dr. Spalding later asked Dr. Mann. if he
had any objection to dividing this question.
Dr. Mann said he had, as it would confuse
things. He stated that -the only action before
the house was to allow the use of certain
readings In the public reading of the lessons
of the Old and New Testaments. Nothing, he
Stated, is. said as to where they are being
printed or In what : manner they are being
printed. He said this was a' question that
could not be divided.
The Rev. Dr. Perclval H. Hlckman of Colo
rado followed and said:
"Therefore, I move you. Mr. Chairman, that
this question be divided in the way I say:
first, the question brought up by the motion
of Dr. Mann and then the question of the mar
gin as distinctive from the- interlining method,
and then the other question following.
The Rev. Dr. Kim arose to a point, of
order. He said it was substantially a repe
tition of the resolution of the committed for
which Dr. Mann's was an amendment. That
being the case, Dr. Spalding' s suggestion was
out of order. ' . . . ,

ough criticism. The second objection was that
the proposed changes lack authority In weight
of scholarship. The third was that they would
be an obstacle to the missionary operations of
the church. The fourth I was that there was
too large an element of interpretation and com
ment in many of the proposed readings for
them to be called accurately a transaction.
Numerous questions were asked 'Dr. Gram
mcr at the close of. his argument. He said he
was not criticising the committee as a whole,
but only portions of its report.
The Rev. Dr. Spalding of Alabama then took
the platform and said in part:
"I am almost afraid that taking the plat
form will incline me to a speech, but I will
try to conform myself In regard to that. X
arose simply to urge the division of the whole
question. I would like to have what Dr. Gram
mer has been discussing come before us as to
what goes' in the marginal reading.
"If w'e settle It should go into the mar
gin. Then I think a separate question should
come up as to whether a clergyman should be
allowed to read that, in the lessons, in the place
of the King James text,' or whether he should
bring it forward as the command of the church
In the way of a commentary; that these mar
ginal readings would not be the Individual
commentary of some learned man. but would
be the authorized commentary by the council
of this church,- and when those points have
been discussed then I think we should come
to final action on the whole matter. This mat
ter should be adopted separately and In
order. I have heard here that certain words
were blank to certain laymen. I never found
any difficulty In expounding the word of God
to the ordinary layman. '. I think very little
Instruction on the part of the clergy will fa
miliarize them with its meaning. Some of it
I have heard expounded In modern slang. I
don't think the sacrednesa of the word can
be preserved In any such way as that and I
would rather, as far as I am concerned, make
use of the wisdom of this committee and all
other committees and preserve the text that
has been sacred to our Anglican life.

SOME PRELATES WHO DISCUSSED THE CANON ON MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.
House of Bishops
Passes Canon
36.
ONE of ths most Important pieces {
/of church legislation considered !
'.by the House of Blshopjf at- tU^-~ *
present session is canon 36, re- [
lating to the solemnization of
marriage and the prohibition
of remarriage of divorced per
sons, which was adopted yesterday by a
vote of 37 to 29. The debate on the sub
ject was long 'and interesting. This redion
will come up for discussion in the House
of Deputies to-day, and from the senti
ments of many members it is thought the
measure will not be concurred in.
This canon has long been under consid
eration by the clerics and laity. It has
been advocated for many years. Commit
tees were appointed by both houses at the
ninth triennial convention, which held
joint sessions and framed amendments to
the canon. These committees reported
back to their respective houses. Yester
day the Hou3e of Bishops took action,
and to-day the deputies will In all proba
bility follow its example.
MAJtRIAGE A2TD DIVORCE.
The canon passed is ds follows:
The solemnization of matrimony In this
church Is a service in which the mutual con
sent of the parties entering Into this state of
life Is given In the presence of a minister, who,
having pronounced them in the Name of the
Holy Trinity to be man and wife, invokes the
divine blessing upon their union.
In the solemnization of matrimony the min
isters of this church shall be careful to ascer
tain and to observe the law of the State gov
erning the civil contract of marriage in tlw
place where the service shall be performed.
No minister shall solemnize the marriage of
any person, who under the law of the place of
marriage la not free to marry without the
consent of parent or guardian, unless the parent
or guardian of such minor Is present and con
senting, or shall have given written consent to
the marriage, or is permanently resident In a>
foreign country.
No minister shall solemnize a. marriage except
In the presence of at least two witnesses, nor.
In case the parties are unknown to the minister
without the presence of witnesses to whom the
parties are personally known, unless in the
Judgment of the minister It shall be lmDracti
cable to obtain such witnesses.
Every minister shall without delay formally
record In the proper register the name, age and
residence of each party. Such record shall be

Rear Admiral Wlnfield Scott Schley waa
placed on the retired list to-day, havlngr reached
the age of 62 years, at which officers of that
gradeâ except those who have received a vole
of thanks by Congress^ â retire from active ser
vice in time of peace. Such, at least, is the
operation of the law in the case of Schley, for
an act passed June, 1900, permitted "any re
tired officer during the following twelve years
to apply for active duty at sea or on shore
as he might be able to perform," but as the
Navy Department would have to approve such
a request it Is not to be supposed that the
Secretary would favor Schley to any euch ex
tent. In the highly \u25a0probable event of coming
out unscathed from the searching inquiry into
his professional conduct during the Spanish-
American war it is most likely that the ad
ministration will i make such reparation in Its
power by giving Schley such duty as he might
The" service record of a little over forty-five
years of Rear Admiral Schley had been with
out a blemlBh up to May, 1898, and the allega
tions of disobedience of orders, cowardice, etc.,
are yet to be substantiated. It is asserted that
Schley was popular only with a small number
of officers . in the service, but the same may
be said against Sampson. The latter's friends,
however, were power(ul and constituted the so
called navy ring at Washington,, and it Is
difficult to conceive by what course of reason
ing the Navy Department came to the con
clusion that the selection of Captain" Sampson
as commander-in-chief-was legal or proper.
There was not a single Incident in that offi
cer's career to single him out as "eminently
distinguished" above other officers; on the con
trary his record was not so good as that of
eome of those of higher or the same rank. \
As. however, the ill-feeling engendered by
the selection of Sampson over that of other
ranking officers has narrowed down to Schley'
vs. Sampson, it is unnecessary to give the rec
ords of others than these two, and their service
record is presented in a condensed form, sing
ling out incidents by which either one may lay
claim to distinction, be it good or bad. '
Schley entered the naval academy September
20 1856, and graduated June 15, I860, standing
number 21 in a class of 26. Sampson entered
one year laterâ September -24â and graduated
June 1 1861, being number 1 In a class of 20.
After graduation Schley made a cruise In the
frigate Niagara, returning to the United States
in April, 1861. and served successively in the
Potomac, Wlnona, Monongahela and. Richmond,
participating in battles and skirmishes, up to
July, 1S63, when, after a short shore leave, he

SALEM. Or., Oct. 9.â Governor Geer leaves
October 17 for Columbus, Ohio, to participate

es for the Republicans. The Governor to-day,
in response to a question as to his opinion of
the Schley court of inquiry, said:
"Of all the stupid, senseless, childish affairs
that have ever engaged the attention . of the
Government, the Schley investigation takes the
blue ribbon without a rival. One might sup
pose that some blunder had occurred at Santi
ago by .which our forces had met with defeat
and through which we had been humiliated
before the world. It is said the Brooklyn
made a loop, therefore Schley should be cen
sured. Well, euppose a loop was made; since
after the fight was over there was nothing
left to shoot at that ever wore Spanish colors,
it is difficult to surmise what more could have
been expected or desired. To be of sufficient
importance to justify an investigation, it must
be true that the making of that loop detracted
somewhat from the completeness of an Ameri
can victory,' but since, notwithstanding the
loop, the entire Spanish fleet was swept from
the face of the sea, it makes a timid man
shudder to contemplate what might have hap
pened if for any reason, the loop had been
neglected. By all means censure Schley for
making that loop."

BATTLES WITH BOERS
When, after much delay, the Navy Depart
ment took action, November, 1893, in the alleged
irregularities. Secretary Herbert appointed Cap
tain Sampson to investigate the truth of the
charges and extent of the frauds, if any. There
was no escaping the fact that serious frauds
had been committed. It was found that sixty
six armor plates, distributed among twelve
ships, were either seriously defective or had
been improperly treated, and - the Carnetrie
Frlck-Schwab Company was fined the nominal
sum of $140,000. . Sampson and his inspectors
were not even censured for their neglect none
of the defective . plates were removed from tha
ships and Sampson continued as chief of the
bureau oÂ£-ordnance until June, 1897. -
A third incident In Samnson's shore career
Is the part he took in ferreting out the armor
frauds of Carneffle in 1S94, committed while
Sampson was chief of the bureau of ordnance,
and as such had direct supervision over the
official inspectors appointed to prevent such
frauds on the Government. .
As to the sea service of W. T. Sampson the
records show that he served over five years on
the Colorado and Congress on the European
station, two years in China waters on the
Swatara. one and a half years in the Pacific
on the San Francisco and ten months on the
Atlantic station on the Iowa prior to March,
189S. There was not a single Incident in these
ten years to indicate that Sampson was "head
and shoulders" over any other officer
performing' similar routine service, and
his "eminent distinguished courage, skill
and .genius In profession" must there
fore be sought for in his shore
service record. Sampson Indicated very early
in his career a preference for shore duty and
has spent about fifteen years at the naval
academy and over nine years on various as
signments in Washington. It was while super
intendent at the naval academy, 1SS5-90, that
an incident occurred which caused unfavorable
comments throughout the service, tha details
of which were as follows: The superintendent
of the naval academy is allowed the Sea pay
of his grade and In addition to furnished quar
ters Is also allowed a cook and steward paid
from the regular appropriation. Sampson, how.
ever, v^s apparently not satisfied that he- had
enough help, and, as ho claims, had an un
derstanding With the cook and steward by
which they consented to a reduction in their
pay sufficient to enable Sampson to hire ad
ditional help without paying for it himself.
Subsequently the - two servants sued Sampson
in a Justice's Court and recovered their re
tained pay. It was an unsavory scandal and
soon after the captain was detached and sent
out to the Union Iron Works to superintend
the completion of the cruiser San Francisco.
Again, in 1891, Sampson distinguished him
self as senior member of a board of inquiry
into the causes of delay in the sailing- of the
Alert. It was well known that Captain Hitch
cock, .Lieutenant Commander Wainwrlght and
Chief Engineer Ford were unwilling to sail in
so small and undesirable a ship as the Alert
and that they resorted to all the means to
prevent sailing. An excuse was found, in the
discovery that the vessel had been Improperly
repaired, and for this alleged neglect the con
structor was clearly responsible. The motto
In the navy Ig. however, that "officers must
stick together" whenever it can be done, and
another victim had to be found. Sampson dis
covered It In a foreman, whose first knowledge
about anything 'being wrong with him came
with a letter of dismissal from the Navy De
partment upon the recommendation of Samp
son. "\u25a0._*.
When Schley's term as chief of the bureau of
equipment expired he turned over to the treas
ury an unexpended balance of about {100,000,
stating In his report of September 1, 1888: "I
have the honor to. report that all appropria
tions for this year have been found sufficient
and in some there are unexpended balances to
revert to the treasury." This action of Schley
caused considerable unfavorable comments from
other department chiefs, it being considered
a bad precedent not to expend the entire ap
propriation and to ask for more. â¢ -

In June, 1871, when Schley was executive
officer of the Benicla, a naval expedition cap
tured five Korean forts as a punishment for
having -fired upon i surveying- parties from
American ships. Commander Klmberly, cap
tain of the Benlcia, wrote to the Navy Depart
ment saying:
"To Lieutenant Commander W. S. Schley be
longs the credit of organizing the expedition
and carrying out the several details, which
went far to prevent confusion and insure suc
cess. His arrangement of the boats, his super
intendence of. the various labors on shore in
destroying the guns and forts, encouraging the
men and setting them a brave example, in
being the second in the fort at its storming
and being in readiness at all times to render
assistance where most needed, render praise
unnecessary. Tho facts of his labors and ac
tions, judgment and system speak for them
selves. I commend him to your notice."

the turn, is 4600 yards, the Maria Teresa 3700
yards. Taken from the chart when the Maria
Teresa and Oquendo were about to run aahdre.
which is practically the nearest point, the
Oo.uendo was-2S0O yards from the Brooklyn and
the Harla Teresa 3000 yards."
Quoting Lieutenant Commander Hodgson's
statement that the shortest range of the
Brooklyn's guns in. the battle was HOD yards
and her greatest 250Q yards, and referring to
the fact that a number of the Brooklyn 5-inch
shells had struck the Spanish ships, Mr. Kay
nor asked a number of questions for the pur
pose of showing that it' the distance was as
great as the chart shows and the guns were
set for the range given, it would have been
impossible for the shots to go to the mark.
"Isn't it certain," he asked, "if the shots
struck that the chart is incorrect?"
The witness replied that "the Maria Teresa
and the Oquendo could have been hit with
nve-lnch guns."
"With guns set at that range?"
"Yes; she could do it. I have seen some
ve ry wild flre when a ship has any motion on."
Captain Lemly then took the witness, devel
oping the fact that he had been for six months
In the coast survey, where he had dally used
the sextant. The Judge Advocate asked: "How
far would have been the Brooklyn from the
leading Spanish ships just emerging from the
harbor of Santiago provided she had immedi
ately started ahead at twelve knots?"
In reply the witness said: "At twelve knots
speed she would go in live minutes 2000 yards,
it she was going ot that speed, but she was
dead in the water, as I understand. Then, I
should say she would make about 1000 yards
thu first five minutest! 'That would mean that
she was close to 6000 yards from the Morro.
The ships when I first sighted them were at
Caysmith. I bellexe that to the best of my
recollection to be 1000 yards inside the Morro.
These ships came out of there at about ten or
twelve knots. At twelve knots they would go
one-twelfth of a knot in five minutes. That is
2000 yards, but they turned to the westward,
so they did not go 2C0O yards."
The court then asked: "Do you know that
any orders were signaled to the fleet by the
Brooklyn during the battle of July 3?"
"From, my own personal observation, I do
not know."
Indiana's Captain Testifies.
Lieutenant Bristol was then excused and
Rear Admiral Taylor was called. He- stated
that when the battle off Santiago on July 3
began the Indiana, of which he was in com
mand, had occupied the easternmost post of the
line of blockade, having- taken the place of the
flagship Xew York when it left for Siboney.
In reply to a question from the judge advo
cate as to whether he had observed the posi
tion of the Brooklyn at the time of the begin
ning of the battle, the witness said: .
"Just before the beginning of the battle I
did, and on two other occasions thereafter."
"After the beginning of the battle, please
state where you observed the Brooklyn, whether
you noticed her proximity to the Texas, and
what It was."
"When the battle had been on about ten or
fifteen minutes my attention was attracted to
the Brooklyn by my signal officer, Captain
Dawson. He said to me that tne Brooklyn
must be injured, or words to that effect, as
she was dropping out of action. I observed the
Brooklyn heading apparently south, or offshore.
She was then on my port bow, half a mile per
haps ahead of me, and at that time a mile out
side the line of our column. She was not turn
ing as far as I could see. The Texas was ap
parently lying still in the water. I did not see
whether she was backing or not. The distance
between those two ships was impossible for me
to see. as they were too nearly in line for me
to judge of the distance between them. I sim
ply observed that there was a bunch of ships
ahead of me. Not more than a- few minutes
later my attention was again turned to the
Brooklyn. She had then proceeded a distance
not over two miles and not under one mile
from the time I had seen her first, and the
second time I saw her, as near as I could fig
ure out, one and a half miles to seaward of
our column of battle. Immediately afterward
she passed into thick smoke, which was lying
in patches about. I took no further notice of
her. On thesa two occasions, however, my rec
ollection \ is very plain and the distance very
near to what I stated. "
In reply to a question If there was any at
tempt on the part of any Spanish vessels to
ram any of the vessels of the American
squadron, witness replied:
"I observed that there was no such attempt."
Objection to the Signals.
When the judge advocate had concluded his
interrogatories Kaynor began his cross-exam
ination with an effort to introduce certain sig
nals which had passed between the Indiana
and Admiral : Sampson's flagship, the New
York, in the early morning of July 3, 1S9S.
Captain Lemly made immediate objection and
Mr. Raynor presented an earnest plea to be al
lowed to read the signals. He was not 'per
mitted at that time to do so, but it is under
stood that the signals alleged to have been sent
from the New York to the Indiana were dated
at S a. m. on that date and were an invitation
to accompany her to Siboney. The admiral's
invitation was wigwagged by Captain Chad
wick and was as follows:
'The admiral wishes to know if you will join
him this morning in going to see General
Ehafter?"
To this Captain Taylor replied at 8:37:
"Work aboard ship previously going- on pre
vents me from going with you to-day."
Mr. Raynor contended that the signals were
among the most important occurrences of the
day prior to the time that the command of
the fleet devolved upon Commodore Schley.
Captain Xemly replied that under previous
rulings of the court the reading of the signals
were clearly Inadmissible. He, however,
agreed that he would consult with Mr. Ray
nor, and that If after this consultation the
question including the reading of the signals
should appear proper. Admiral Taylor could be
recalled and the question asked.. To this Mr.
Raynor consented and the court took a recess
for luncheon.
At the afternoon session Admiral Taylor said
that on the morning of the battle of July 3
the Indiana had signaled: "The enemy is
escaping."
The court asked only one question of Ad
miral Taylor, as follows:
"Was the Indiana In such position with ref
erence to the Brooklyn and the enemy's ships
just after they cleared the entrance of the
harbor that you could form a fairly correct
estimate of the distance between them?"
"At the time mentioned there were but two
occasions when the smoke permitted me to see
the Brooklyn distinctly. I could not, there
fore. Eay what was the distance between the
enemy and the Brooklyn Just arter the Spanish
fleet came out of the harbor."
Admiral Taylor was then excused and Lieu
tenant Commander Templin M. Potts, who was
navigator of the Massachusetts, was called.
Commander Potts said that he had been on the
Massachusetts on May 81, the day of the bom
bardment of j the Colon, when Commodore
Schley had used that vessel as his flagship.
# Remarks Made by Schley.
Detailing Commodore Schley's conversation
on that occasion the witness said:
"When Commodore Schley came on board I
heard him say: 'Higginson, I am going In
with you and the Iowa and pot the Colon with
your big guns. I want to fire deliberately
Admiral .Sampson will be here, to-morrow
morning and I wish to destroy the Colon ' or
words to that effect. After that there 'was
a conversation between Commodore Schley and
the commanding officer of the ship as to when
we would go in, and it was determined that
we would allow the men to go to dinner and
go in afterward, which we did. Later on
about 1 o'clock, I think, while on the port
bridge Just abaft the pilot-house, I was pres
ent at a conversation between Commodore
Schley and Captain Higginson, in which the
question of where the ship was to be foueht
was under discussion. Commodore Schley
asked Captain Hlgpinson what position he in
tended to take. He replied: N 'I think the
conning tower.' Commodore Schley replied
"Yes, I think that is wisest* Shortly after
this Commodore Schley and his staff the cap
tain and myself went down to the conning
tower, ort the forward thirteen-inch turret
Commodore Schley, Commander Schroeder i
think Commodore Schley's personal staff and
myself were standing as the ship was stand
ing in toward the entrance. Commodore Schlev
said in my hearing and presence: 'Gentlemen
we are very conspicuous objects here in white'
I think we had better get out of this.' Com
modore Schley left the forward thirteen-inch
turret and took his place on the small plat
form on the lee side of the conning- tower "
Captain Lemly â At what stage of the engage
ment was this? ~
"As we were steaming in toward the en
trance before we had turned to the east
ward."
Captain Lemlyâ Did you hear any further
conversation?
"I heard the conversation when Commodore
Schley was leaving the ship in which he stated
that he was satisfied with the reconnoissance
that he had made in drawing the fire of the
batteries, or words to that effect."
"What was the bearing of Commodore Schley
during the engagement of May 31, to which
you have already ref erred?"
"His bearifig and manner were those of a
man who was suffering under extreme mental
excitement; of one who had a disagreeable
duty to perform and performed it reluctantly
and tried to get through with it as soon as he
could."
Mr. Raynor then began his cross-examina
tion.
"Who was the captain of your ship?" he
"Francis J. Higginson."
Prior to this, when Senator Henry Cabot
Lodge, immediately after the death of
Mr. McKinley, hastened to London and
over the head of the Embassador had a
long conference with Lord Lansdowne.
the general idea was that the new Presi
dent desired to ascertain the views of the
British Ministry without the intermediary
of an Anglophile Minister. Later, when
Senator Wolcott of Colorado made a fly
ing visit to London and betrayed an un
usual dislike to being quoted in interviews,
the opinion gained ground that here was
possibly the next representative of Amer
ica in London.
While dispatches from Washington fore
told the possible retirement of John Hay
from the Cabinet on account of differences
of. opinion. with the new President as to
the foreign policy, Americans in London
predicted that before such an event were
possible it was a foregone conclusion that
Choate- would retire, as he entertains the
same views as Hay. The Nicaragua
treaty is regarded as the last straw call
ing for a new Embassador to the court of
St. James.
LONDON,* Oct. 9.â Joseph Choate,
United States Embassador to Great Brit
ain, with Mrs. Choate, will leave London
for New York on Saturday. "Whether he
will return again in his Embassadorial ca
pacity Is not known, but general -opinion
Is that he will not.
Since the accession of Mr. Roosevelt to
the Presidential chair the American col
ony in -London has been speculating when
a change would be announced at the em
bassy, Mr. Choate being regarded as a
positive antithesis to the stalwart policy
as personified byyMr. Roosevelt.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"None that I ever knew of."
Lieutenant Leiper was then called. He
served on the New Orleans during the Span
ish war and. told of the participation of that
vessel in the bombardment of the Colon May
31. He described the engagement, saying
there was no order either to fire at or to
m:Jce observations of the batteries. But not
withstanding this, he did fire at the eastern
batteries on his own responsibility. One shot
from the enemy fell thirty or forty yards
from the New Orleans. He thought all the
shots from the American ships had fallen
short of the Colon.
The witness said he had secured his most
accurate idea of the strength of the shore bat
teries by the fact that on June 14 the New
Orleans had approached to within 1650 yards
of them, remaining for twenty minutes and
silencing them after four or five minutes.
Lieutenant Leiper was still on the stand
when the court adjourned for the day.
â¢"What efforts were rrt^fieby the vessels .of
the flying Squadron prior' to the arrival of
the Marblehead: to determine whether or not
Cervera's squadron was in the harbor of Cien
fuejros?"
"I quoted conversations that I had had. The
first thing was the apparent anxiety of Com
modore Schley about using the conning trfwer.
Secondly his stating that at a distance of
five to six miles men standing on the forward
13-inch turret were conspicuous objects."
"Did the commodore use the conning tower?"
"I did not see the' commodore go into the
conning tower. To the best of my knowledge
and belief he did not. He was outside the
conning tower and between the conning tower
and the heavy plate that protects the manhole
in the conning tower. My preconceived idea of
Commodore Efchley previous to that occasion
was so entirely different from the Impression
I received on that day I concluded that he cer
tainly was under a tremendous mental strain."
"Have you ever . been under any mental
strain in time of battle?"
"I have been scared."
"Have you any other facts from which you
base your statement to the court that he was
laboring under mental excitement except the
facts which you have given?"
"Yes. When Commodore Schley came on
board tho Massachusetts he stated in distinct
terms that he was goins in to destroy the
Colon. The Colon was not destroyed. When
he' left tne ship he called it a "reconnoissance,"
drawing the fire of the batteries and devel
oping their weakness or strength."
"Do you gather from that that he was labor
ing under great mental excitement?"
â¢'From that and from circumstances I have
already stated from my observation of him
from the time he came on board the ship un
til he left."
"Suppose you were made aware of the fact
that when he entered into that engagement he
was under obligations to the Navy Depart
ment to not engage batteries if there was any
danger of the' shore batteries crippling the
ships, would you say, if you knew of that, he
was still laboring under great mental excite
ment?"
"I cannot answer that question."
Captain Lemly objected to the Introduction
of tho Navy Department's orders aa evidence,
but the court decided they could be put in.
Mr. Raynor then asked 'concerning ! the
weather on the trip from Cienfuegos and the
witness said that on May 23 it had been what is
called "dirty." There was an easterly wind
and a moderate sea, rough for small vessels.
The witness said on further examination that
Lieutenant Commander Schroeder, Lieutenant
Zars : and Lieutenant Wells had been present
during the bombardment of the Colon, when
Commodore Schley had remarked that as they
were conspicuous objects on the thirteen-inch
turret it would be better to move away.
Referring to the Spanish shore batteries at
Santiago, Commander Potts said'- they would
have been no menace to armored ships passing
them.
At the suggestion of Judge Advocate Lemly
and in accordance with the decision of the
court, Mr. Raynor here formally Introduced
as evidence the order of the Navy Department
concerning the exposure of the American
ships to the fire of the'shore batteries. The
crder is that issued by Secretary Long, April
6, 1898, and directed to Admiral Sampson. The
court asked questions as follows:
"Can you give the distance the large ves
sels were from the entrance to Cienfuegos on
the early morning of either the 22d or 23d of
May?"
"I do not recollect being nearer than I
have said, four or five miles."
"Apparently."
"Had Captain Higgrinson opportunity to ob
serve him on that occasion?"
"Not as well as I did."
"Why was that?" ' - *
"Because Captain Higginson was In the
conning tower and I was outside."
â¢â¢Did not Captain Higginson have any con
versation with the commodore at that time?"
"From time to time, yes."
"What do you mean by 'mental excite
ment?' "
"I want to read you what Captain Hlffgln
son says about Commodore Schley's manner
and bearing upon that action. He say a: 'His
manner was that of a commander la chief.'
He left a different impression in your mind
from what he left on Captain Higglnson's mind,
then?" .'

WASHINGTON, Oct. fl.â In the
Schley Naval Court of In
quiry to-day Lieutenant Mark
L. Bristol completed his tes
timony begun yesterday anl
three new witnesses were introduced.
They were Rear Admiral Henry C. Tay
lor, who as captain commanded the bat
tleship Indiana during the war with
Spain; Lieutenant Commander T. M.
Potts, who was navigator of the battle
ship Massachusetts during that period,
and Lieutenant Edward F. Leiper. who
was on the New Orleans during the war,
the last named being still on the stand
when the court adjourned for the day.
Admiral Taylor related incidents of the
battle off Santiago July 3, including the
Brooklyn's famous turn. He said that
none of the Spanish ships had made any
effort to ram the American vessels when
they came out of the harbor at Santiago.
Commander Potts' testimony dealt espe
cially with the bombardment of the co
lon. Answering a question from Judge.
Advocate Lemly as to the conduct ol
Commodore Schley during that engage
ment, he said it was that of a man labor
ing under great mental excitement and oÂ£
a man who was anxious to discharge a&
soon as possible a disagreeable duty.
Lieutenant Leiper expressed the opinion
that the Spanish shore batteries at San
tiago had not been at any time formida
ble. . ,
During Commander Potts' examination
Mr. Raynor secured permission from the
court to introduce as evidence the order
of Secretary Long to Admiral Sampson
dated April 6, In which he was admon
ished against the exposure of the Ameri
can vessels to the tire of strongly forti
fied ports. The paragraph in that order
which he especially wished to be consid
ered reads as follows:
"The department does not wish the ves
sels of your squadron to be exposed to
the fire of the batteries at Havana, San
tiago de Cuba or other strongly fortified
ports in Cuba, unless the more formida
ble Spanish vessels should take refuge
within those harbors. Even in this case
the department would suggest that a rigid
blockade and employment of our torpedo
boats might accomplish the desired ob
ject, viz., the destruction of the enemy's
vessels, without subjecting unnecessarily
our own men-of-war to the fire of. the
land batteries."
The dispatch also contains the following
order:
"The department further desifes that in
case of war you will maintain a strict
blockade of Cuba, particularly at the/
ports of Havana, Matanzas and, If posai
ble, of Santiago de Cuba, Manzanillo and
Cienfuegos."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET X
VT., WASHINGTON. Oct. 9.â Miss Stone
has been located on a mountain on the
Turko-Bulgarian frontier. She was alive
and well on Saturday last. This was the
re^suring Information the State Depart
ment received to-day from Consul Gen
eral Dickinson at Sofia. It strengthens
the hope entertained by the officials that
the brigands have no Intention of putting
Miss Stone to death and that she will be
safe until the ransom is paid.
The State Department has forwarded to
Mr. Eddy, secretary of the legation at
Constantinople, who has been negotiating
with the brigands, a draft sent it by the
Boston Board of Missions. This draft Is
only half of the sum demanded, and de
termined efforts are being made to induce
the brigands to accept a smaller ransom
than they seek.
It would not surprise the officials should
the Bulgarian Government send troops to
eurround the mountain upon which the
brigands, with Miss Stone, have sought
refuge. The department dispatch Is rath
er vague, but indicates that this moun
tain is In Bulgarian territory. The
authorities would naturally prefer Miss
Stone's rescue without the payment of
ransom, but rather than that she should
be harmed they think the money should
be paid.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 9.â A trust
worthy report locates Miss Stone's ab
ductors on the summit of a mountain at
Gultepe. on tha Turko-Eulgarian frontier,
near Dubnitza. It is said that the kid
naping- band numbers eighteen. Arrange
ments have been made to surround the
mountain with Turkish and Bulgarian
troops. It has been suggested that the
abductors of M ; ss Stone are members of
the old Macedonian committee, actuated
by motives of jealousy, and that they are
endeavoring to accomplish the downfall
of the present committee. The Bulgarian
Government has promised to act vigor
ously.

TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES.
Officers of the American "Warships
Tell of Important Conversations.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 9.â Notwithstanding to
day marks an important turning point in tha
career of Rear Admiral Schley, being nothing
less than the date of his transfer from the
active to the retired list of the navy, he was
in his accustomed seat within the railing of
the court of inquiry and gave his usual atten
tion to the proceedings of the court. The re
tirement of Rear Admiral Schley is In accord
ance with law, he having reached the age of
62 years. It was generally remarked he did
not look bis age.
The formal proceedings of the day began
with the reintroductlon of Lieutenant M. L.
Bristol formerly watch officer on the Texas,
as a witness. He wag under cross-examination
when the court adjourned last night and Mr.
Raynor continued his questions to-day.
Other witnesses on the list for to-day in
cluded Lieutenant Commander Potts, who was
navigator on the Massachusetts during the war
with Spain; Lieutenant Grant, who was also
on the Massachusetts: Rear Admiral H. C.
Taylor, who. as captain, commanded the bat
tleship Indiana; Commander William H.
Schuetz, who was navigator on the Iowa, and
lieutenant J. H. Holden, who, as an officer
en the Scorpion, made the log record of the
communication of Commander Southerland to
Commodore Schley concerning the condition off
Santiago.
Mr. Raynor began his examination of Lieu
tenant Bristol with questions concerning the
accuracy of the ; stadlmeter for the measure
ment of distances at sea. He asked If he
would rather trust his own visual observation
for a 4000- yard range than the instrument.
The witness stated that the stadimeter was
more accurate for distances below 4000 yards
than above that distance. At that distance he
would make several observations for confirma
tion of visual observation.
"Could you give me," asked Mr. Raynor, "a
point from which it Is entirely reliable?"
"Yes." was the reply, "at zero it is ab
solutely accurate."
The witness considered the sextant much
more reliable in measuring the distance be
tween ships. He had. he said, taken several
observations with the stadlmeter Just before
the Spanish fleet came out of the harbor and
had checked these with the sextant. He found
the distance from the Morro to be 5100 yards.
Lieutenant Bristol was also questioned by
Mr. Raynor concerning the distance out of. the
blockading vessels at ' Cienfuegos, but he de
clined to change his estimate of yesterday that
it was eight or ten miles distant from the har
bor. Mr. Raynor Eaid:
"I 'will read you Commodore Schley' s report
as to the blockade off Cienfuesros. He says:
'A line of blockade was established about four
miles off shore and at night an in-6hore line
was maintained consisting variously* of the
Scorpion, Dupont and Castine. the last named
vessel arriving on the 23d. convoying the Mer
rlmac' If you are right the commodore has
stated what has not occurred when he says:
'A line of blockade was established about four
miles off shore at Cienfuegos.' That is not
a correct statement of the commodore's, is it?"
Sure of His Figures.
"The statements I make are what I thought
and what I believe to be right I do not ques
tion other people's words."
"Now refresh your recollection with an offi
cial report. The statements you have made
are that during the day that squadron lay
off Cienfuegos from four to six to ten miles,
and during the night from eight- to ten miles.
Without questioning either. Commodore Schley
or yourself when I read you his official report
do you still stand on your statement about six
to ten miles?"
"I have to stand by my statement."
Speaking of the weather Vfluring the cruise
of the flying squadron from Cienfuegos to San
tiago the witness said there were fresh breezes
and that there was a moderate sea. A small
boat could, he said, have been lowered at any
time during the voyage.
Mr. Raynor also Interrogated Lieutenant Bris
tol concerning his estimate, made soon after
the arrival of the fleet off Santiago, that the
Spanish shore batteries amounted to but little.
He had said yesterday that the elevation of
these batteries was from 150 to 200 feet. Mr.
Raynor produced a chart to show that the
Morro battery was 220 feet above the water
line and the Zocapa battery 230 feet.
"Now then," asked Mr. Raynor, "are you
as positive about the distance you gave here
as in other cases In which you have given
distances?"
Captain Lemly objected to the form of tha
question, saying counsel was putting language
he had not used in the mouth of the witness.
Mr. Raynor . then made objection to the in
terruption and after stating this objection said
to the witness: "If you are not positive I
shall submit to any question."
Judge Advocate â The witness has not stated
that he was r>osltive.
Admiral Deweyâ I would rather you would not
Interrupt the testimony.
Judge Advocateâ If the court tells me I can
not do It I will submit to the order of the
court.
Admiral Dewey â If counsel for the applicant
has put words into the mouth of the witness
which he did not utter you (addressing Cap
tain Lemly) can bring it out at the proper time.
You will have an opportunity to do that.
Judge Advocate â That Is not the advant
ageous time to do it. The advantageous time
is when it Is done.
Mr. Raynorâ In order not to put any words
in your mouth. w"hlch is an unfortunate in
sinuation, because I am after the truth, I will
give you an opportunity now to make a full
explanation as to whether you stated the ele
vation of these batteries to be between 100 and
200 feet.
I did state that."
"IMd you not state to me you are positive
as to other distances you have given In the
case?"
"I did."
"Do you still stand to your statement? Is
the map wrong and are you risrht?" .
"I will stand by my statement. I had not
Been the chart when I prepared my statement."
Gloucester "Was Endangered.
Mr. Raynor asked the witness whether there
had been any menace to any of the American
ships on July 3 from the shore batteries. Lieu
tenant Bristol replied that there was danger
to the Gloucester because that vessel was un
armored. He said that he did not consider the
New York in danger.
Mr. Raynor then read a report by Secretary
Long stating that on that "day the New York
had sustained the undivided fire of the shore
batteries.
"Do you still say, In view of that statement,
that the shore batteries did not amount to any
thing?"
"You asked my opinion." the witness re
plied, "and I have Riven it to you."
Admiral Deweyâ "We don't want opinions.
At the request of Mr. Raynor the witness
made measurements from his chart' to show
the distance the Brooklyn was from the Span
ish ships during: the fight off Santiago. The
reply was: "The distance of the Oquendo from
the Brooklyn, taken from the chart just before

A NEW DEPARTURE
A New, Effectual and Convenient
Cure for Catarrh.
Of catarrh remedies there Is no end,
but of catarrh cures there has always
been a great scarcity. There are many
remedies to relieve, but very few that
really cure.
The old practice of snuffing salt water
through the nose would often relieve, and
the washes, douches, powders and Inhal-
ers In common use are very little, If any.
better than the old fashioned salt water
douche. â¢
The use of Inhalers and the application
of salves, washes and powders to the
nose and throat to cure catarrh Is 'no
more reasonable than to rub the back to
cure kidney disease. Catarrh Is just aa
much a blood disease as kidney trouble
or rheumatism and It cannot be cured
by local treatment any more than they
can be. \
To cure catarrh, whether In the head,
throat or stomach an Internal antiseptic
treatment Is necessary to drive the catar-
rhal poison out of the blood and system,
and the nQW catarrh cure Is designed on
this plan and the remarkable success of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is because be-
ing used internally it drives out catarrh-
al Infection through action upon stom-
ach, liver and bowels.
Win. Zimmerman of St. Joseph relates
an experience with catarrh which is of
value to millions of catarrh sufferers
everywhere. He says: "I neglected " a
slight nasal catarrh until It gradually ex-
tended to my throat and bronchial tubes
and finally even my stomach and . liver
became affected, but as I was able to
keep up and do a day's work I let it run
along until my hearing began to fall me
and then I realized that I must get rid
of catarrh or lose my position, as I was
clerk and my hearing was absolutely
necessary.
. "Some of my friends recommended an
Inhaler, another a catarrh salve, but they
were no good in my case, nor was any-
thing else until I heard of Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and bought a package at
my drug store. They benefited me from
the start and in less than four months
I vms completely cured of catarcji,
although I had suffered nearly all my life
from it. . " â¢
"They are pleasant to .take and so.
much more convenient to use than other
catarrh remedies that I feel I cannot
say enough In favor of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets."
A little book. on cause and cure of ca-
tarrh will be mailed free by addressing
F. A. Stuart Co., Marshall, Mich., and
the tablets are sold by all druggists In
the United States and Canada, â¢ . r v

Tv-hen the brain is active, the stomach is
inactive for lack of necessary blood. The
natural consequence is indigestion, and
indigestion opens the door to many dis-
eases.
Indigestion is cured by the use of Dr.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery,
\u25a0which cures diseases of the stomach and
other organs of digestion and nutrition,
and enables the perfect digestion and
assimilation of food.

George R. Fairbanks of Florida followed and
epoke to the much-debated question. He said
be had simply taken. the platform to assert the
rights of the laity. Continuing he said:
"'I am the only member of the laity with
a vote in this body who has taken a etand on
thie -subject. AVe of the laity, we people of
the pews, are 000 to one of you. You are
sfmpTy delegated to read to us. We are to
understand what you read and we want to un
derstand it correctly. . We want you to have
the privilege of reading the Scriptures cor
rectly to us. The committtee has done Its
work faithfully and I hope Its report will be
adopted by this house."
The Rev. Frederick A. de Rosset followed
and paid in part:
"Any member of this house committee or
.any man in the world has a perfect rigrht to
print, publish, circulate and freely distribute
any part or portion of the Bible that he wishes,
with any comment or with any interpretation
or translation of the Scriptures. For a num
ber of years a committee composed of the
best men in the Protestant Episcopal church
of America has undertaken and endeavored to
eet forth a Bible with certain marginal In
terpretations or new translations. The learned
committee has consulted everything that was
In their reach â and I presume everything x in
the world of literature was in their re_A and
consulted by themâ and has presented to us a
well-digested report.
"We do not propose to alter the text of the
Bible, but we do propose to let grow up along
side of It and find there a glossary and mar
ginal reading that shall interpret it from gen
eration to generation. What harm are you
doing, even though there may be some things
that are net exactly acceptable to you? What
harm will It do us? There are many good
things, and we cannot have time to accept
them and to reject others. We must take it

and they will lose the work of this generation
o( the church If you do not accept that por
tion or the work of the committee."
The Rev. Dr. Carey of Albany asked that the
resolution offered by the deputy from Vir
ginia ' be accepted by the committee In place
of the report. The chair said he had no au
thority to accept It; that the bouse could not
grant 6uch a request.
HEV. DR. MANN'S AMENDMENT.
The Rev. Dr. .Alsop of Rhode Island moved
that the amendment of Dr. Mann be laid upon
the table until the vote be taken upon the
main question, and he gave notice that if the
motion be not carried he should ask that the
Mann amendment be taken immediately front
the table for consideration. He thought the
house should vote on the main question first.
A delegate moved that the amendment and
substitute both be laid upon tha table.
The Rev. Dr. Mann Inquired if they were"
laid upon the table and the question be put
upon the main motion upon concurrence with
the House of Bishops, and that be lost, would
it be competent to renew itâ not as an amend
ment â but whether it would be competent to
renew his motion. The chair stated that the
,house had the whole matter at all times in
Its hands and therefore it could take from the
table what had been laid there, but of course
It would have to be done by general consent.
The Rev. Dr. Parks of New York contended
that they had a right to amend a proposition
in order to get It into a condition where, they
could vote on it. He objected to a proposed
amendment which deprived him of his rights.
The Rev. Dr. Fulton said he wished to say
most icsitivelv without debating the question
at all that, he could vote conscientiously for
the main measure if Dr. Mann's amendment
be first adopted, otherwise not. And he thought
he ouzht to have' the opportunity to improve
the Dror-osition in order that he might vole
for it., if sossible.
The bouse became involved in a maze of
amendments, substitutes, motions, points of
order and appeals, from which it finally
evolved the following results:" -.
The chair ruled that the vote must' first 'be
taken on the substitute proposed.
The Rev. Dr. Grammer of South Virginia
appealed from the decision.

MEMBERS OF HOUSE OF DEPUTIES DESCUSS REVISION OF SCRIPTURE
The story of an old man's infatuation
for a young and handsome married wom
an was told in Judge Conlan's court yes
terday when the case of Mrs. Mamie Wil
son, 679 Minna street, charged with felony
embezzlement, was called. She was ac
cused by S. Strand, a machinist living at
S00 Minneapolis street, of embezzling $320
which he gave her to use in purchasing a
lodging-house at 1013 Market street.
The evidence showed that Strand, who
is 68 years of nge, met Mrs. Wilson on thfj,
street about four weeks ago and he be
came Infatuated with her. After subse
quent meeting* he asked her to marry
him, but she informed him she already had
a husband. Then he suggested that ha
would purchase the lodging-house and she
could manage it. He drew $320 from the
bank on October 3 and they went to the
house to complete the purchase. He al
leged that he laid the money on a table
for a moment and Mrs. Wilson took It,
saving she would attend to the business.
Before finishing the business Strand and
Mrs. Wilson, accompanied by a piano
player, went to a restaurant at 21 Sixth
street to have breakfast, and Mrs. W Uson
made an excuse to leave and did not re
turn. Strand made love to the piano
player, but she became indignant and also
left. Strand then complained to the po
lice and Mrs. Wilson was arrested. Her
defense was that Strand gave her ?1jO
with which to buy a sealskin and pre
sented her with a ring, and that she did
not take the $320. The Judge will give his
decision to-day.

Board of Education Favorably Con
siders Case of Miss Geraldine
Donovan.
The Board of Education is preparing to
restore Miss Geraldine Donovan to her
former position in the Richmond Evening
School. Miss Donovan was consolidated
out of the school a year ago, but the
board has never ratified Its .own action, as
the law "prescribes. Miss Donovan re
ceived assurances from President Kln
caid at yesterday's meeting of the board
that she would be assigned to her old po
sition, as Miss Maguire, principal of the
school, had filed notification that another
teacher was needed there.
Auditor Wells notified the board that he
would not audit the demand for $10,465 for
the purchase of the school site at Twenty
fourth and Douglass streets until he had
consulted his attorney. There is some
doubt whether the Board of Education
has the power to acquire realty.
The secretary was authorized to adver
tise for bids for the erection of buildings
on the children's playground lot, located
at Seventh and Harrison streets.
Notice to amend rule 87 was griven by
Superintendent Webster by adding "by
senior teacher is meant the teacher pos
sessing seniority or greater term of ser
vice," and rule 85 so as to permit absence
without personal permission of teachers
for one day In case of sickness.
Miss Carrie Haas was granted a leave
of absence for one month.
The resignation of Kathryn H. Daly
frcm the eligible list was accepted.
The application of Miss Elinor Murphy
for retirement on annuity was granted.
The following recommendations for
teachers' certificates tnade by the City
Board of Education were adopted:

A mesea*e was received from the House of
Bishops notifying the deputies of the passage
by it of the resolutions published in yester
day morning's Call on the subject of mar
riage and divorce. A motion was made to con
cur therein, and the matter became the special
order for this morning.
Lay Delegate Lewis moved that the subject
of marriage and divorce, which follows mar
ginal readings on the calendar, be taken up
by the House of Deputies this morning. It
was so ordered. i*'i_!-i i '\u25a0'"' >â¢
The Rev. Mr. McConnell moved that all
amendments concerning marriage and divorce
be printed. Lay Delegate Stetson of New York
stated that there were two documents already

mittee of the House and that portion of the re
port of the Joint committee on canons; that the
amendments to canons 36 and 37 had been pre
pared and presented in the House of Bishops
RESTTLT OF THE VOTE.
The Rev. Dr. Brown moved \u25a0 to lay on the
tabla the resolution of the Rev. Dr. Craw
ford that they concur with the House \u25a0 of.
Bishops," provided it be distinctly understood
that these readings be> not Interlined with the
authorized version but printed in the margin.
The motion was carried. The motion then re
curred on the resolution of the Rev. Dr. Mann.
The hour for adjournment having arrived, on
motion the house voted to prolong the session
until a vote could be taken on the matter
pendlns. -
The Rev. Dr. Mann explained that the ques
tion was on the amendment offered by him,
which provided that such marginal readings
as the commission had taken from the mar
gin of the authorized version, from the text
and marsln of the Bnslish revised version and
from the. text and margin of the American re-
Vised version shall be allowed in use in the
lessons of the morning and evening prayer of
the church. . ' ' '
Deputy Stetson of New Tork. on behalf of
the lay "delegation from that diocese, demanded
that the vote be taken oh the main question by
dioceses and orders: ' '_
A vote was then talien on Dr. Mann s
amendment, which appears in another column
contalning-a report of the proceedings of the
morning session, and it was carried by a vote
of 177 ayes to. 129 noes. .
The Rev. Dr. Hlckman then revived his sub
stitute in favor of the use of the Canterbury
On motion of the Rev. Dr. EstUl of Ken

it was only fair to take the vote first on the
amendment offered by Dr. Mann, then to vote
on the proposition to concur . with the house
amendment offered by Dr. Mann; then to vote
on the main proposition and not force them
to vote for something for fear that the main
proposition would fail. ' '

BISHOPS PROHIBIT RE-MARRIAGE
The Rev. Dr Davenport followed and said
there was in print in the hands "of the General
.Convention the. revision which wai drawn by
the commission on revision, containing their
canon on marriage and divorce, and secondly,
the report of the committee of the House con
taining a canon on marriage, together with a
proposed, amendment to that report by one
member of that \u25a0 committee.
The Rev. Dr "Greer" of New York stopped
further discussion by advocating that all
amendments on the subject be printed and dis
tributed arrionac, the . members of the house.
The motion prevailed' and adjournment was
taken until this morning at 10 o'clock.

The Girls' Friendly Society is the
Etrongest organization of its kind in the
Episcopal denomination and because of
Us strength it is frequently referred to
as the handmaiden of the church. The
society Is not as strong on the Pacific
Coast as in. the East, but a determined
effort 5s to be made to strengthen it in
this locality. President Mrs. Thomas Rob
erts and Miss Thomas, vice president and
organizer, announced at the meeting last
night that they would meet with the grirls
and their friends next Monday afternoon
in the assembly hall of the church for
the purpose of aiscussing matters pertain
ing to the society's welfare.
Mrs. Roberts in her address traced the
history of the Girls' Friendly Society and
recalled its principles. She said that the
efforts of society are needed among girls
many of the prominent Bish
ops and a number of the leaders of the
society. The addresses, which were all
â¢short, were on topics best calculated to
inspire and encourage the young ladies in
their work.
A MEETING designed especially
for the benefit of the members
cf the Girls' Friendly Society
was held last night at St.
Luke's Episcopal Church.

in every walk of life, among the girls
of the factories, of the shops, of the
schools and among the girls in the higher
circles of society. She stated that a deep
sentiment of friendship existed not only
between the girls of the society but be
tween members and all their associates.
This spirit of friendship, she claimed, is
directly attributable to the work of the so
ciety. "She. recalled how the Girls' Friend
ly Society in America had sprung from
the parent body in England and how in
its birth the young organization had made
a solemn treaty with the parent body,
whereby it bound itself to maintain in
violate the three cardinal rulesâ that the
members" shall be bona fide communicants
of the church; that they shall sow the
seeds of friendship and mutual aid, and
that. none but girls whose characters- are
irreproachable shall be admitted to mem
bership.
Miss Paddock, vice president and organ
izer, also delivered a short address, in
which she described the good deeds which
have been wrought by the society, espe
cially in the missionary field.
Bishop Hall of Vermont spoke. In re
gard to the divorce Canon- which was
passed to-day by the House of Bishops
he said that the best manner of protect
ing the purity of the home is through the
medium of the Girls' Friendly Society.

Canon 36 does not forbid parties who
have been divorced from remarrying, but
does forbid a minister of the Episcopal
church from performing such a ceremony.
Canon 37, which is akin to the one
adopted yesterday, will probably be
adopted to-day by the House of Bishops.
It provides that the Innocent party in
cases of adultery is not liable to disci
pline. - . . \u25a0-: "
In the discussion yesterday the Bishops
seemed ,to be of the opinion that in cases
where the civil law has separated the
parties if one feels a desire to marry by
God's law he or she better go to thfe civil
authorities and have the ceremony per
formed. The reason expressed for such
a course was not that they felt absolutely
certain that the law of God approves such
marriages, but they did not feel absolute
ly certain that the law of God allowed
them. In consideration of the subject the
Bishops made it evident that they be
lieved there was collusion in many cases
of divorce. .

ENGLISH BREAKFAST TEAâ T. C. S..

the term breakfast tea" was
applied to a mixture of congou, flowery
pekoe and chop of Powchong. This made
such a pleasant tea that there was a great
demand for it, and as it could not be ha-I
at any^place but the tea store of Richard
Davles on Chatham street. New York
some one sent ten pounds of it to China
with instructions to make a large ship
ment of the same. The Chinese soon dis
covered the mixture and since that time
have put it up in half chests and shippe'l
to all parts of the world. Davles, who 1
had established a good business, soon had
his trade taken from him. became a ped
dlar of coffee. and died very. poor in New
Jersey.

THE OLD AMERICAâ Yachtsman, City,
In the first race for. the America's cup the
America was matched against the Vo
lante, the Arrow and other boats. The
"Volante when third in the race sprung her
bowsprit, the America being at that time
more than a mile in the lead. The Ar
row, far in the lead of the Volante, went
ashore, and the second boat to finish was
the Aurora, .the smallest of all in the race.
The America was after the race bought
by Lord Blaaulere, who put a sailing
master on board who did not understand
her and matched her against the Arrow,
which defeated her badly.'
OUR various controversies with Canada have
been most of the'm before the public for a
long time,' and it is quite likely they will
continue to engage the attention of diplomatists for
a long time to come. Such, at any rate, is about the
only conclusion that can be drawn from the recent
statement of John Charlton, member of the Canadian
Parliament and of the Joint High Commission ap
pointed to settle the disputes, that the vital point
in the whole -controversy is .the Alaskan boundary
question, and that the position taken by the United
States with respect to it is "unfair and" untenable."
Charlton is reputed to be a statesman of high
ability and a man of friendly feelings toward the
United States. If he and such as he approach* the
disputes, between the two countries in the spirit re
vealed by the language quoted, what are we to "ex
pect of those members of the Canadian Government
who' are 'but jingo politicians and whose sentiments
with respect to the United' States are dominated by
prejudice rather than by friendship? -., - \u25a0, /
The claim of the United States concerning the
Alaskan boundary is based upon the treaty made be
tween Great Britain Â£nd Russia defining that, boun
dary. We claim nothing more than the British con
ceded to Russia by the language of the treaty, and
we certainly cannot be expected to take anything
less. - The- treaty declares that the boundary in dis
pute runs along the crest of a mountain range
parallel to and not more than ten marine leagues dis
tant from the sea, and that where the crest of the

. Philadelphia politics this year has developed a
funny situation. The most noted leader of the fight

bat Wanamaker's son runs one of the yellowest jour

The political bosses have been prompt to take ad
vantage of the fact, and the voters are now being told
that if they vote against the ring their votes will give
a boom to yellow journalism.
THE FACEâ Coin. City. The face on
the silver dollar of the present day is
from sketches of the features of Miss
Anna W. Williams, who was at the time
it was adopted an attache of the parent
mint in Philadelphia. George J. Morgan,
who drew the design, made several
sketches of the lady's face and finally
used one of them on the dollars that were
issued in 1878, but he had altered it so
that the lady did not recognize it and did
not leaern until 1889 that her features had
been used as the basis for the figure of
liberty on the new coins."
SCHOONERâ Subscriber, City. The name
schooner applied to a class of sailing ves
sels is derived from the Dutch word
"schoon," beautiful. The first vessel of
that class was, it is said, built at Glou
cester, Mass., by Captain Andrew Robin
son in nu\ When the vessel, which was
masted and rigged as "schooners are to
day, was going on* the stocks a bystander,
using the word schoon as a verb, said,
"Oh, how she schoons." The owner over
hearing this said "then let her be a
schooner," and from that time the vessels
of that class have been so called.
MDE BLOCH, whose theories on modern
war have been seemingly confirmed by
â¢ every, event of the 'war in South Africa, is
one of the men who have profited most -by that pro
longed struggle. Without the war he would doubt
less have found it difficult to get a hearing from
anything but an academic society, but as it is h e not
only commands large audiences when lecturing to the
general public, but he has had the opportunity Â«to
address military bodies, and has thus gained in pres
tige as well as in reputation.
Lord Roberts is quoted as having said recently:
"When I went to South Africa I laid down the rule
that the files were, not' to be closer than six paces
when advancing to attack. That was very soon al
teredVto ten, and then to twenty paces. It is abso
lutely .necessary to be widely separated." It is fur
ther reported that General Von der Goltz of Ger
many, in discussing the demonstrations made dur
ing the Transvaal war, said that the battle of the
future is a riddle which no one can solve until it has
been actually fought out. His argument is that a
strong position well defended could not be carried by
long lines of widely separated riflemen alone, while
if an attack were made in masses the attacking force
*vould be exterminated by the defenders.
The views thus expressed by military men are con
firmations of the theories with which de Bloch inter
ested the world before the war in South Africa be
gan. . It is another evidence that all knowledge is
not confined to professionals. De Bloch is a
banker, but he none the less forestalled; all mili
tary writers of the time in calculating the effects
which improved firearms have produced in the con
duct of war.
In a recent lecture before the British United Ser
vice Institution , M. de Bloch said: "At Waterloo
Wellington had some 35,000 men on each mile of
ground. At Magersfontein the Boers, with some
6000, defended twenty. miles of frontâ that is to say,
they found 300 men per mile sufficient to hold their
line against British attack." By reason of the great
gain thus given to the defensive force it is argued
that it will be well nigh impossible hereafter to oon
quer a brave people who are resolved to maintain
their independence. De Bloch therefore declares it
to be now a useless waste of money to maintain the
enormous standing armies that so burden th*e nations
of Europe. He says the drilled soldier of the bar
racks will not be in future any better than the indi
vidual fighter, who has been taughtto rely upon himl
self. Discipline and tactics will count , for little in
opposition to courage and the ability to shoot and
to take care of one's self without waiting for the
word, of command.
WAR IN OUR TIME.
MOUNTAIN HIGHâ Subscriber, City.
The term, or expression, "Waves moun
tain high." Is only a figure of speech, for
it is said that waves do not rise mountain
high. Waves in the North Atlantic have
been observed to rise 43 feet in height. Jn
the South Atlantic 22 feet is recorded. It
is reported that there have been waves SO
feet in height in the Bay of Biscay. In
the German Ocean they do not rise more
than 14 feet.
CIGARETTE SMOKINGâ T. S., City.
Slight poisoning by cigarette smoking is
indicated by nausea, but poisoning of the
system by the excessive use of cigarettes
is indicated by pallor, depression and loss
of nerve power. When that condition is
reached it is advisable to stop the use of
cigarettes, consult a reputable, physician
and follow his advice.

NOT GIVEN OUTâ T.- B., City. The
amount paid as salary to the parties
named in letter of inquiry is information
that is not given out by the parties inter
ested.
Surely we must be lenient to the errois of out
siders when the State is so ignorantly misrepresented
*Jby.-_a^ witness who professes to speak for it semi
Â£ officially. If the Industrial Commission want accu
f:frate* information : about California, it should call on"
" bur Senators and Representatives, who are well
equipped with knowledge of pur productive condi
tions and industrial, processes.
W"E are in" receipt of a copy of the evidence
given to the Senatorial commission of in
quiry into industrial conditions in behalf of
California.
The pundit who gave the evidence is named Turn
*bulL HÂ«S ; testimony shows less knowledge of- the
State thaa may be in possession of any well blooded
animal enjoying the last syllable 'of his name. For
tunately it carries its own antidote and can do the
State no harm. Affecting profound knowledge of
our productive conditions, he was asked how wheat
is handled here. He answered that it is handled in
elevators, the same as in the East, and that these
â¢were . conveniently placed alongside railroad tracks
and wharves, just as in -the- East, and that ships
carried grain the same way as in Eastern ports.-
The fact of course is that not a bushel of grain is
handled in bulk here; there are no elevators; grain
is sacked in the field, stored in sacks in the ware
house, and loaded in sacks on ships for export. We
have seen no comparison between the cost of hand
ling it in sacks and by elevators, but we assume that
the sacking method is more, costly. In the East
wheat gets into a sack at all only to be hauled to the
nearest elevator, whereit is handled usually by com
pressed air' It is delivered in bulk from the elevator
into cars, and from these is sucked, by an exhaust
process, into the holds of ships for export.
All of these processes are unused and unknown
here, at least by any one except this pundit, who turns
his bull's eye upon our grain and sees it flying into
and out of elevators "conveniently located."

were laid, and that number of small maid
ens sat down to dine. It was a real little
girl's dinner, and the little hostess her
self presided, sitting at the head of the
table. She had been very anxious. In
looking forward to it, to do everything- aa
it should be done.
"Mamma," she asked, "shall we say
grace?"

It is this wrangle that makes the report of the death
of the Ameer of Afghanistan so startling to London
just at this time. In fact, the British Government has
projected a line of railway from the Indian frontier
to the Persian Gulf, and the proposed line was de
signed to cross a portion of Afghanistan. Should
anything prevent the extension of British railroads
the consequences would be very serious to the em
pire. It can readily be understood, therefore, why the
United Kingdom felt a shock when the report of
the Ameer's death was received. ' It meant for the
British the loss of a friend in the very place where
they most need one just now.
It -will be remembered that a short time ago" the
British sent a warship to Koweyt for the purpose of
preventing the Turks from occupying that ( port. It
was believed at the time that it might lead to a clash
with the Sultan, and the danger, it would seem, is not
yet over. The Sultan is the rightful sovereign of the
province, but the Arab tribes that occupy it have
never been submissive subjects, and the British, for
their own purposes, have encouraged them to act in
dependently. The recent dispatch of a war vessel to
the scene of the trouble appears, therefore, .to mean
a determination on the part of the British to claim the
port as their own and thus prevent it from falling into
the hands of either Russia or" Germany.
DESPATCHES from London announcing the
receipt in that city of the report of the death
of the Ameer of Afghanistan said: "In view
of the existing critical situation in South Africa the
news sent something like a'- shock through the
United Kingdom." It is not strange it should have
done so. Affairs throughout Southern Asia, from
Syria to the confines of India, are evidently becoming
seriously tangled, and the Ameer is one of the men
upon whom the British have relied most confidently
to keep the peace until the South African "struggle
is over and their armies are released from service in
that quarter of the globe.
Asia is an enormous continent, but vast as is the
area, its peoples and its politics are closely linked to
gether. Just at present the danger point is at the
Persian Gulf. The^ Germans have a concession for a
railway from the Bbsphorus to the Gulf, of Persia by
way of the valley of theEuphrates. Shortly after that
concession was granted the Russians obtained a' su- ;
preme influence in Persian affairs by reason of a loan
made to the Shah, and it is believed to be only a :
matter of time when Russia will get control, of a
gulf port as a commercial and a naval base. â¢
The two things mean' that both Germany and Rus
sia are to be firmly established on the Persian Gulf,
and that in turn means that those powers will have
strong positions on the route from the Suez canal to
India. British supremacy in that part of the ocean
is therefore seriously threatened, and British states
men and British generals are well aware of the
menace.
SOUTH ASIAN POLITICS.
There is a growing demand in London that j Lord
Roberts return to South Africa and give Kitchener
a chance to come to London and explain.

A COMPREHENSIVE table, compiled by Controller of the debtedness of each county for -the yf ar 1901 It aso,hows the
State E. P. Colgan from the records of his office, and rate of 'taxation i In i each county. The State rate 1 3 43 cents on
r~ ? l S herewith, will prove of great in- '"valuation of university and other State mort
terest to the taxpayers of every county in the State. ga ges is i $1 605 980. The floating debt of the State, with inter
ims table shows the values of property in and the in- est, is $108,833. The table follows:
The sober second thought of the people is quite
likely to demand of State Legislatures some 'action
in line with these judicial interpretations of the power
of the States, and as a result there will be less incite
ment to disorder and fewer appeals to passion to
commit such crimes as the murder of the. President..
These three decisions considerably illuminate the
pathway of State legislation. They do not go to
the prohibition of any publication, but to the en
forcement of responsibility for abuse oHhe right to
publish.
They also cast a strong light upon the abuses with
which the public has become familiar in the Hearst
papers. When they published the hope that the
United States Supreme Court Justices "would be
tarred and feathered in the streets of Washington"
they were bringing that tribunal into contempt an'd
disrespect. When they advised every man that it was
his duty to make every one around him discontented
they were assailing public order. When they declared
that anarchy would teach the country a useful lesson
they were attacking the foundations of law and gov
ernment.
In the State vs. Merrill the Arkansas Supreme
Court said: ''Any citizen has the right to publish the
proceedings of a court, and, if he deem it necessary
for the public good, to comment on them freely and
to discuss the fitness or unfitness of the Judges for
their 6tations, but he has no right to attempt by
defamatory publications to degrade the tribunal, de
stroy public confidence in it, and dispose the com
munity to disregard and set at naught its orders,
judgments and decrees. Such publications are an
abuse .of the. liberty of the press, and tend to sap the
very foundations of good order and well being in
society. -The liberty of the press is one thing, and
licentious, scandal is another." â¢
THE first passion of the country has subsided,
and the propositions for treating anarchy that
were made when the President was struck down
are now being subjected to deliberate analysis. In
this calmer temper there is no doubt tliat some laws
on the subject will be framed and passed by Con
gress. These must naturally relate to a closer exami
nation of immigration. Foreign countries are rather
glad to get rid of their violent and disorderly people
and to bestow them upon us as a problem. There
may Well be some doubt about such Governments
giving much assistance in securing the record of
known anarchists who desire to migrate to this coun
try. Perhaps it will be found necessary, to compel
all immigrants to be certificated by the American
Consul at the port of departure. That official may
be charged to thoroughly examine each applicant for
a certificate, taking all the time that is necessary. It
may be said that this will work a hardship to the in
tending immigrant, but that is not our affair. Our
duty is to spare this country the hardship of receiving
the sworn enemie*s of- all law and all government.
Such immigration regulation will give us time to
look over our home stock of anarchists and deter
mine what to do with them.
In that part of the work Congress is checked by
constitutional limitations which do not apply to the
States. 'Congress may exercise only the powers
granted by the constitution, while the States may
exercise al! powers not forbidden to them by the
constitution. The States, therefore, may define the
limits of free speech and a free press, and may make
misdemeanor or felony of acts upon which Congress
may not legislate at all.
What, may be done by the States was outlined in
the trial of the Haymarket anarchist assassins in Chi
cago. When their cases were appealed to the Su
preme Court of Illinois Chief Justice Magruder, in
passing upon them, said: "If men combine together
as conspirators to accomplish an unlawful purpose, as
the overthrow of society and government and law,
called by them 'a social revolution,' and seek as a
means to an end to print and speak, in order to incite
others to tumult and riot and murder, those who ad
vise or instigate the others to violence will be held
responsible for the murder that may result from' their
aid and encouragement. He who inflames people's i
minds and induces them by violent means to accom
plish an illegal object is himself a rioter, though he I
takes no part in the riot. If he wake into action an i
indiscriminate power he is responsible. If he give
directions, vaguely and incautiously, and the person
receiving them act according to what he might have
foreseen would be the understanding, he is respon
sible. It can make no difference whether the mind
is affected by inflammatory words addressed to the
reader through the newspaper organ of a society to !
which he belongs, or to the hearers through the j
spoken words of an orator to whom he looks up as i
a representative of his own particular class."
In the case ,of the People against Banks, in Kan
sas, there was involved a statute providing for the
punishment of a newspaper devoted to the publica
tion of scandals and accounts of lecherous and im
moral conduct. The court said: "We entertain no
doubt that the Legislature has power to suppress
this class of publication without in any manner vio
lating the liberty of the press." .

mountains is at a greater distance" then" the boundary,
runs along a lin,e ten marine leagues from .'the sea and
parallel to the windings of the coast. ' The Canadians
have set up a claim that the boundary should run ten
leagues from the coastline from headland to headland
without regard to the windings of bays, and because
we do not set aside the plain language of the treaty
and concede that claim Mr. Charlton charges that our
position is unfair and untenable.,
It goes without saying that so long as Canadian
statesmen of the eminence of Mr. â¢ Charlton holds
such views our disputes with Canada will go' on. It
is to be regretted that it should be so' The points
in controversy are not of any grave importance to
either ourselves or the Canadians, and no one be
lieves that any of them will ever be a cause of war.
None the less their existence is "a continual provoca
tion to wrangling. It was earnestly hoped that the
present Joint Commission would find a way for set
tling all of them, but up to this time.it has done
nothing to justify the expectation, and now Mr.
Charlton's words will g0 far to put an end to the
hopes of the most sanguine.

Leach testified further that the money
for the sale made in April was not de
posited in the Sub-Treasury until June 30,
as shown by' Dimmick's books in his own
handwriting.
R. M. Anthony, real estate dealer and
money lender, was asked by Bert Schles
ingor of special counsel for the Govern
ment whether he had not loaned money
to Dimmick April 28, 1900. The question
being objected to, Schlesinger explained
that he wished to show that Anthony
called upon Dimmick on that date and
loaned him S400 on Dimmick's note at a
big commission. The answer was ruled
out by the court.
This closed -the . case for . the Govern
ment. Benjamin J. Smith, K. C. Craft,
ex-Senator John J." Boyce of Santa Bar
bara, E. A. Google and Albert R. Knoll
testified that Dimmick's reputation for
truth, honesty and integrity was good.
Schlesinger asked the witnesses
whether they had heard cf certain alleged
dishonest transactions of the defendant
with the Tallant Banking Company, the
Cutter-Tower Company of Boston and
James S. Kirk of Portland, Or., and the
witnesses replied that they had read
something in the newspapers touching
upon those matters.
An adjournment was had until 10 a. m.
ro-tlay. t
In answer to a question by George D.
Collins, attorney for Dimmick," the wit
ness said that he was unable to state
whether the $19S 37 paid in by Dimmick
was or was not the identical money re
ceived by him three weeks before.
Superintendent Leach, on the Stand.
Frank Leach, Superintendent of the
Mint, related a conversation he had had
with Dimmick February 5 of this year
concerning the transaction spoken of by
Cashier Cole. The witness on that occa
sion asked the defendant how he could
justify the use of the voucher for ?498 37.
and Dimmick replied, "Mr. Leach, 1 don't
think there was anything improper In my
use of that voucher; it was not for my
own benefit, but it was for the accommo
dation of the Government. You know
that on the last &ny of the quarter I am
required to deposit all money with the
United States Sub-Treasury. That quar
ter ended on a Saturday. It was a short
and very busy day and I sold some blue
stone. I hadn't time to go down and col
lect the money for it, and seeing this
voucher I took it Into the cashier's office
and used the proceeds to make good this
deposit that 1 was expected to make at
the Sub-Treasury on that day." Dim
mick added that he had intended to take
up the voucher on the following Monday,
but was taken sick on that day and was
not able to get out of bed until some time
thereafter.
The witness then said to Dimmick: "It
is possible that you have no criminal In
tent, but from a moral standpoint your
act was wrong. It Is apparent that a man
with your peculiar ideas of morality can
not stay here any longer. I will give you
time to look for another place â two or
three months, or longer if necessary. Your
relations with the Mint must cease."
Delay in Depositing Money.
Cashier W. K. Cole of the Mint was the
star witness yesterday in the Dimmick
trial In the United States District Court.
He told about Dimmick having drawn
from him April 7, 1900, $498 37 for the de
clared purpose of paying a bill to the
Selby Lead and Smelting Works, and that
on the 30th of the same month Dimmick
left a sick bed, came to the Mint on
crutches and iupaid the amount. The wit
ness admitted that at the time he consid
ered the transaction irregular, but that he
did not notify Superintendent Leach of
fhe matter until February of this year.
The witness admitted also that he did not
maKe any entry in the books of the Mint
regarding the transaction, and that he
carried bills amounting to $1348 50 as cash
from day to day until Dimmick made the
settlement April 30. He added that if the
money had not been returned April 30 the
transaction would have been revealed by
the" books.
Frank Leach â¢ Narrates . a
Confidential Talk Had
With Defendant.
The Dora lost her propeller when off
Golofnin Bay and had to put back to St.
Michael under sail. At the latter place a
new propeller was welded on. but as the
job was not a perfect one the vessel did
not make extra speed coming to San
Francisco.
The crew of the Acapulco saw a lot of
Nicaraguan troops being landed in Colom
bia, ar.d the supposition was that they
were going to he.p the insurgents. Rains
were very heavy on the coast, particu
larly at San Jose do Guatemala.
The Dora made iho run from St.
Michael in 19 days, via Unalaska It days,
in spite of a damaged propeller. She
brought down fifty-two cabin passengers
and twenty-three Chinese. All the parr-'en
gers were employes of the company on
the Yukon, coming home for the winter.
Thev pay the prospects are good at Daw
son'and. in fact, at all points on the
river. Nome is crowded, however, and
many people w5H starve there this winter
if helo is not s< a nt in the shape of a relief
ship. "
The Dora left the United States ships
Manning and MeArthur at I'r.alaska Sep
tember 24 and the transport Seward at
St. Michael September 19. The steamship
Portland left Unalaska September 24 and
the St. Paul two days later for Nome.
They should get back here about the end
of the menth.
Besides these she brought up three
steerage passengers and twelve Chinese
in transit.
The Pacific Mail Company's Acapulco
arrived from Panama and way ports and
the Dora from St. Michael via Unalaska
yesterday. The Panama boat brought S23
packages of mercnandise. of wÂ»ich 103
wore coffee and 95 treasure, valued at $91,

b!ers. Owing to the fog and light
winds, however, it was sundown before
she made port, as her captain would not
acct-pt a tow. The Anjou was 167 days
cut from Xev.castle-on-Tyne with a load
of coal, and the underwriters were paying
15 per cent to reinsure their chances. The
vessel was not really overdue, but the
fate of the c.'romartyshlre scared the in
surance people and tney offered premiums
on every vessel loaded with Tyne coal
that was making a long voyage.
The Cromartysnire left Newcastle, hng

fire. The crew had 'to abandon her and
the vessel became a total loss. On the
Principality, now out 15S days from New

cent is being paid, while on the Glenbreck,

Rheumatic pains are the cries of protest
and distress from tortured muscles, aching
joints and excited nerves. The blood has
been poisoned by the accumulation of
waste matter in the system, and can no
longer supply the pure and health sustain-
ing food they require. The whole system
feels the effect of this acid poison ; and
not until the blood has been purified and
brought back to a healthy condition will
the aches and pains cease. .
Mrs. James Kcll, of 707 Ninlli street, XT. C,
Washington, t). C, writes as follows: "A few
months ago I had an attack of Gcialic rÂ»heumc-
tism in its worst form. The

Declare There Is a Sure
Cure for Nervous
Ailments.
Use of Paine's Celery Is
Openly Advised.
Wonderful Beeults Recently Effected
by Compound.
BUFFALO. Oct. S. ISOl.-An evening pa-
per publishes a symposium of physicians'
opinions regarding the efficacy of various
remedies for the cure' of nervous prostra-
tion and attendant Ills. Each physician
â¢was asked to express his opinion, first,
whether those -Mseases were curable when
once they had gained a hold upon the pa-
tient. and. second, whether the same rem-
edy would be beneficial in all cases.
Without exception the physicians inter-
viewed declare J that nervous prostration,
when not too far advanced. Insomnia, i
rheumatism, indigestion, resulting as It
most frequently does from deranged
r.prves. dizzy headaches and most livtr
and kidney complaints were absolutely
curable.
Cut the answer to the second question
vas most remarkable, because with two
exceptions all the doctors mentioned by
name Fainc's celery compound, a well-
known remedy, manufactured by \Vell3 &
Kichardson Co. of Burlington, Vt., and
first discovered by the eminent Dr. Ed-
ward Pholps seme years ago, after a
thorough Investigation and the accumula-
tion cf a pi eat deal of data, both here
and In Gei many.
It is probably the one instance, says the
rewspnpor, wliere a prepared remedy has
been openly indorsed by physicians of
such standing. It seems that the formula
of the compound has always been fur-
nished to physicians in regular standing,
and that tlic remedy is generally
prescribed by up-to-date practitioners,
both here and in England and Germany,
where it is quite as well known as in this
country.
Many wonderful cures by the use of this
famous compound are cited, one of them
the well-known case of Commodore
Howell of Washington.

Meade Hamilton, fullback for Lowell. He
did the kicking for his team and showed
he was ' a splendid judge of distance. In
the first goal he kicked the ball was
placed but slightly to the right of the
goal posts. For the second goal the ball
was near the side line on the left of the
field. It went as straight and as true as
a rifle ball between the goal posts.
His field goal, the second he has kicked
this season, was an effort worthy a col
lege team player. The ball was on the
35-yard line, and, although the players on
the opposing team rushed In on him, he
remained perfectly cool and kicked as
though it were for practice. The ball
sailed Â©ut over the heads of the confused
mass of players .and sailed gracefully be
tween the posts on the eastern end of the
field.

every effort, so neighbors say, has been
to make his wife happy. Stevens had no
suspicion that his wife and Preston were
lovers. Preston is said to have alienated
the wife's affections by representing hiai

The first goal was scored by Lowell
after ten minutes' play. Lowell kicked
off for fifty yards, St. Matthew's running
the ball back twenty yards. St. Matthew's
gained five yards by bucking and then
kicked on the third down with four yards
to gain. Lowell then took the ball and
made steady progress. Captain Vosburg
showed to advantage here, gaining ten
yards on an end run. There were regular
gains until the ball was a yard and a half
from goal. Hamilton had the ball and
plunged through left tackle for the neces-
sary gain. He then kicked the goal.
In three minutes more Lowell scored
another touchdown, Hamilton repeating
his former success kicking the goal. A
splendid tackle by Baldwin marked the
end of the first half, with the ball on
Lowell's 25-yard line.
In the second half St. Matthew's play
improved slightly, but It was far from
being fast. There were several exchanges
of kicks, in one of which St. Matthew's
gained fifteen yards.

REDDING. Oct. 9.â While the hog rais

is destroying their droves a fresh epi
demic has made its appearance and
threatens equal ravages among the cattle
and horses. It Â«~ the much dreaded an
thrax, and already it has shown up in so
many localities that to check it before
great loss is inflicted seems impossible. .
The malignant disease first appeared, In
Klamaih County. Oregon, near the Cali
fornia line. It was treated without knowl
edge of its real character. Last week
horses, as well as cattle, began dying in
numbers in iuat vicinity and a veterinary
surgeon iipestigatcd. He believed the dis
ease anthrax. Pathological specimens
were sent to Professor Pernot. the Gov
ernment bacteriologist at Corvallis, who
developed them and confirmed the veter
inary's suspicions.
Anthrax is now running through Kla
math. lion ton. Marion and to some ex
tent the adjoining counties. It is in; the
Sl.Â«kiyou mountains and etock raisers of
Siskiyou County are thoroughly alarmed,
us are those of Shasta County. The driv
ing of Southern Oregon cattle to ranges
on this side of the State line will be pro
hibited by extreme measures If necessary.
The fatalities In the Southern Oregon
counties are reported to be far greater
thaxi given out. In fact, the disease has
never existed in that section before in
such widespread and malignant form.

NEW YORK; Oct.' 9.â A Joint meeting of
the committees of the Royal Ulster Yacht
Club and New York Yacht Club was held
to-day at th,e clubhouse and Sir Thomas
Lipton's proposition was submitted 1 by
Vice Commodore Sherman-Crawford. He
said 'that, his committee, on behalf of Sir
Thomas, desired to ask if the New York
Club would withdraw In favor of Sham
rock 11 that paragraph of the deed of the
gift "providing" that "no vessel that has
oeendefeated^in a match for this cup can
be again selected by any club as its rep T
refeentative until after a contest for it
by some other vessel has intervened or
until after the <ycpiration of two years
from the time;6f such defeat." . .
â¢ He also said that in the event of this
request being acceded to, should a chal
lenge for next year be received from any
one elt-e. Sir Thomas would withdraw his
challens-e. â¢ â¢ .
Commodore 'L/edyard sain that the mu
tual agreement clause gives the clubs the
right to make any arrangement satisfac
tory to both as to dates, courses, number
of -trials, rules and sailing regulations
with any or ail othor conditions of the
match, including; waiver of the ten min
utes' notice; 'but the committee of the
New York Yacht Club was of the- opin
ion that the clause gives no power to the
club holding the cup to accept a challenge
which the instrument itself prohibits ab
solutely. The committee did not think It
was "intended, that, after a boat had had
a trial for the cud and been defeated, she
should be allowed to challenge again until
the time specified has elapsed, and so de
clined to accede to the request.
Sir Thomas, when told of the commit
tee')) decision, said he had no comment to
make, nor would he say whether he would
challenge again with a new yacht. The
crew of the Shamrock will return to Eng
land. 11 is said, on the steamer Oceanic,

game in the county. Walter Martin is
also credited with having a great affec
tion for the country home, and for them
to ii'.ace a lien on it brings surprise to the

Brown claims that he was* plied with

Mrs. W'hitney transferred her share to

Brown is a sugar tester, and a few
years ago possessed considerable property.
He met Mrs. Whitney just after her hus

At Mrs. "Whitney's request Brown con

"Florodora" 13 one of the -prettiest
things that the Columbia Theater has
ever had and is holding much more than
its own this week. The sextet ia in
greater favor thaji ever and the choruses
and ensembles, in which the company's
strength consists, are gaining favor daily.
Miss Grace Dudley, the piquant little per
sonage whose Lady Holyrood has been
the work among the principals, is quite
recovered from her temporary indisposi
tion and is again delighting the house with
her fetching performance. The tuneful
comedy crowds the house nightly and
Sunday performances will be given to
satisfy the large demand for seats during
this engagement. The comedy runs an
other week, when It â¢will give place to
Stuart Robson in a revival of Bronson
Howard's comedy success, "The-Hen
rietta," M~clyn Arbuckle and Russ
Whytal are among Mr. Robson' s support.
"Florodora" will run until Sunday night,

of the most prominent American mining
men in Northern Mexico, was arrested
here this morning and thrown in jail

\\ \ mA// // Jnanv inquiries received
i\ \J' jf JJ by us from- the Medical
Profession and others Interested regarding our
statement that the so-called Weakness of Men
is not a weakness, but symptoms of inflamma-
tion of the Prostate Gland (neck of bladder),
caused by contracted disorders and early dissi-
pation, and that Loss of Vitality, Premature-
ness, etc., are invariably cured by procedures
directed toward correcting . this inflammation,
we wish to state to these many inquiries, in
the columns of the press, that it takes approx-
imately ten weeks to cure thesis disorders of the
male. The treatment is entirely a local one, as
no drugging the stomach is necessary, and that
the patient may treat himself at home under
our directions. We will cheerfully explain the
plan of treatment to any reliable physician on
request. The colored chart ' of the organs,
which we send free on application to* any one
interested in the subject, will be found a great
advantage in "Home Diagnosis," as well as a
study for all Interested in their anatomy. Very

DOUBTERS
Can Be Changed by Knowledge. .
If there is any doubt about making
brain power by the use of certain food,
the doubter should make the following
experiment.
Helen Frances Huntington of Gaines-
ville, Ga., says: "Just a. word of com-
mendation concerning Grape-Nuts, which
I have found to be the most wholesome,
nourishing- and appetizing: food that has
ever come to my knowledge.
"I rim not a dyspeptic, but being con-
stantly engaged in severe brain work I
found that I Old not thrive on ordinary
diet; even a moderate dinner dulled my
brain so as to he practically incapable of
critical work. I tried meat Juice, pepto-
nolds, the two-meal system of light break-
fast and no supper, which brought on
nervous depletion and sleeplessness; so I
resorted to on? and another of the vari-
ous health foods, which ail seemed alike
tastelefis and valueless as a brain food,
until quite by chance I had a dish of
Grape-Nuts food served as a dessert. I
liked It so well that I began to use it daily
for supper, four teaspoonfuls in a saucer
of hot milk, eaten before it dissolves to
mushlness.
"This point sho'uld be remembered, as
after a certain time evaporation seems to
affect the sweet nutty flavor of the food,
.as in the case of certain nne-fiavored
fruits.
"The result In my case was simply as-
tonishing. I had no desire whatever for
sweet pastries, meats or, in fact, anything
else; and my brain was as clear and ac-
tive at night as on awaking from a long,
refreshing sleep.
"The peculiar advantage about Grape-
Nuts food Is that it supplies the nutritive
qualities of a varied diet without the bad
results of heavy eating. I cheerfully rec-
ommend Its us<Â» to. all brain workers. If
not as a.n exclusive diet certainly for. the
last meal of the day. I .always take it
with me when traveling, which saves a
deal of annoyance and discomfort."

CHICAGO, Oct. 9.â There was a complete
change of sentiment in the wheat pit from yes
terday's closing bullish activity. A consid
erable quantity of long wheat had been carried
over night In expectation of a good rise to
day, but when there wag no response in cabled
to the local bulge every one seemed to want
to let go of his holdings, and a rapidly sagging
market was the' result. The usual bearish
statistics were present again with no improve
ment in the cabla list and December opened
to %@%c lower. at 63%@63%c; A sharp
break of He- resulted from liquidation during
the first hour. Reports of a considerable In
crease in shipments had a recuperative effect,
but this was short-lived and on a revival of
selling by bears December declined to 69%c.
On covering near the\end of the session De
cember reacted somewhat, but closed weak lc

Corn ruled dull and weak. Offerings from

"Tho Iramediate future cf the stock market
is indefinite. No bull movement is yet in sight,
and bearish sentiment seems to predominate' in
Fpito of the fact that the big interf-sts Feem
oppufdl to all pronounced declines. The situa
tion Utercfqae offers excellent trading oppor
tunities: rood stocks being a purchase on all
eharp declines, and equally eood pales on all
pronounced rallies. Conservatism is still the
only cafe course."
"At this time of unsettled values it is well
to tlraw t5:e line between railroad shares and
thos* cf the- industrials In estimating intrinsic
wo th. ks ;t ir.urt be remembered that the for
rr.t.- are mostly connected with corporations
t*-at were pessimistically, hence drastically,
reorganized, while the latter were mostly optl
nisticiiily organized and many of them mav
lave to be pessimistically reorganized. Then
the railroads and industrials will be oa a com
mon foctirj.
"The monetary outlook Is somewhat clearer,
as proved by Secretary Gage's discontinuing the
purchase <,f bends. Very soon the outward
cira'.n for crrp purposes will cease and the In
flux of currency win begin. Gold imports ar?
being feteyed. partly owing to Europe's nec.-s
fity for retaining the precious metal, but at
the moment the money market is free of
anxieties.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"â¢One of the most important considerations
Just now is the course of the industrials. In
Aujrust and September xve witnessed a series
cf annual reports, all of an unfavorable na
ture. Reduced earnings have followed lower
prices for products, and it .is very evident that
the era of abnormal industrial profits is on the
v^nc-. New competition is also slowly but
surely making the burden of over-capitaliza
tion felt. The developments in Amalgamated
Copper acted decisively against the entire mar
ket. Fortunately the United States Steel Cor
poration took the public into its confidence and
made an excellent showing as to earnings,
which removed an important element of doubt.
The management deserve commendation for
their courage as well as sagacity. A policy of
secreti vent ss such as is followed by most of
the industrials inevitably provokes distiUEt, and
investors and speculators v.Til do well to leav-Â»
those aione Chat fail to give reliable informa
tion as to earnings and general financial con
dition. It is almost unnecessary to say that
the industrials are especially exposed to trade
fluctuations and that their course will be large
ly influenced by general business. The latter
is stili in cood condition and the outlook is
lor a good fall and winter trade; nevertheless,
the indUFtriais are a weak feature ar.d will
Et:!l bear watching. Those that avoid pub
licity regarding their affairs will probably be
Bharp!y discriminated against. ,

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT- The foreign markets were- weak,
with lower futures at Paris- and Liverpool.
Chicago opened weak on the easier cables,
and declined lc. The market was fairly active
at the decline, though the export demand was
small. Minneapolis reported good Flour sales,
both for export and domestic account.
Broomhall cabled from England that the
world's Rye crop was 160,000.000 bushels short
of last year's. All private cables reported Rus
sian Wheat offering freely. The Chicago shorts
recovered their courage on this, and the bears
started in reselling. The harvest In Roumanla
was reported deficient In quality, but not in
quantity, owing to excessive rains.
In this market futures were lower, but shlp
pmg quotations, remained unchanged.

NEW YORK, Oct. 9.â The same doubt and
hesitation regarding the future course of prices
was reflected in to-day's stock market as in
yesterday's. Speculation was listless and
apathetic and the sentiment of the small
traders, whose operations made up the market,
underwent many variations. Few active stocks
show any change of as much as a point, even
where the day's range was considerable. The
disposition was to 'close up contracts both on
the long and short side until the future course
of prices outlines itself mdre definitely. This
tendency was demonstrated in the response of
Brooklyn Transit and of Atchison to the specific
developments affecting them. The annual re
port of Brooklyn Transit which was published
after the close of the market last nicht was
interpreted unfavorably in all the current com
ment, especially in the disclosure that the
treasury bonds had been sold during the year.
Yet the stock promptly advanced and resisted
an attempt on the part of the professional
traders to deDress the price. The stock ad
vanced at one time 2%. showing the most con
spicuous strength in tne market. The increase
in the Atchison dividend rate, although con
fidently predicted in some quarters, had been
denied with equal confidence in others. In fact
the decision seems to have been discussed and
finally decided in the meeting itseif of the
directors. The attempt to advance the stock
on the announcement proved abortive, the ex
treme rise over last night reaching less than
a point. The doubt over the predicted advance
was due to the fact of the shortage In the
corn crop. Some of the other Southwestern
railroads were offered down sharply as though
to eniDhasize this view. The estimate of the
year's wheat crop in an agricultural periodical,
placing it at a record figure of 100,000,000 bushels
for Kansas alone, was an opportune offset to
this contention. The election of an additional
Standard Oil representative to the Union Pa
cinc beard .of directors was a verification of
another bull prediction. But the bull party
hesitated to take up the speculation for an
advance, owing to the danger that money flur
ries may still Intervene before the interior
movement of currency terminates. Sterling ex
change was notably strong to-day on an active
demand, demand sterling fairly touching $4 h6.
This Is more than a cent in the pound sterling
above the gold Import point. Sugar and Amal
gamated Copper, which continued active, drift
ed rather uncertainly, but with a firm under
tone. Norfolk & Western was bid up nearly
2 points at one time on : the assumption that
recent accumulation of the stock was for ac
count of Pennsylvania interests. The stock
closed irregular.
There was a. sharp break in Wabash De
benture B bonds. The market otherwise was
rather dull and Irregular. Total gales par
value. S2.S4O.00O.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

Forecast Official.
In the face of such declines, and considering
the concentration of holdings, bear attacks
ujÂ«cn railroad securities are likely to be made
with some caution. It remains to be seen
whether the railroad section of the market has
fully discounted the injury to corn and any
possible trade reaction or not. It is well to
remember that Wall street is In the habit of
anticipating such movements, so that when the
results appear the effects are practically nil.
A Wall street authority says: In many re
ppects it is fortunate that the market has
been In control of strong hands. Losses have
been gradual and more widely scattered than
had the decline been unrestrained and the
market left to the tender mercies of the bears.
The extent of the decline is perhaps greater
than realized â from 15 to 30 points on many of
the active stocks. Compared with the highest
prices made last spring the declines which have
taken place are as follows:

Miss Adams expressed her pleasure at
the result of the trial to her friends and
to the attorneys for the defense, Messrs.
Snook, Church and McConaghy. She left
the courtroom as soon as she had bidden
her father good-by. At only one time did
she exhibit any emotion and that was
when Judge Melvin charged the jurymen
that if they found Adams guilty of mur
der in 'the first degree without a recom
mendation of punishment he must fix the
penalty at death. The word "death"
caused her to give a momentary shudder.
The sudden and unexpected concluslrt'n
of the case was brought about through
the announcement of District Attorney
Allen that he had no testimony to off ar
in rebuttal and was willing to submit it
without argument. This offer occurred
shortly before the noon' hour when the
cross-examination of Dr. F. W. Hatch,
produced by the defense, was finished by
â¢Prosecutor Allenl The defense announced
that it had no more testimony. to offer. and
Prosecutor Allen then said the case was
this court.' His trial for insanity will be
set to-morrow morning in this court."
During the proceedings no emotion was
manifested by Adams or Miss Agnes S.
Adams, his daughter. In fact, the possi
bility of any other verdict did not seem
possible to the people who have watched
the case. Upon its announcement there,
was a hum of approval from all sides.
Adams did not change his attitude of de
jection at any time until after the ver
dict was announced. Then he caressed
his daughter. As he was returning to the
County Jail with the Sheriff he met Dis
trict Attorney Allen in the corridor of ths
courthouse and congratulated him upon
his able prosecution of the case.

The verdict was then handed by the
foreman to Clerk Baker, who read It
aloud. The jury was polled and each of
the members .announced his concurrence
in the verdict.
"Such being the result of the jury's de
liberations'," said Judge Melvin, "I hereby
order the defendant absolved from the
charge of murder. However, I direct the
Sheriff to hold Adams in custody until the
matter of his sanity Is passed upon by

"Gentlemen, have you agreed upon a,
verdict?" asked Judge Melvin when the
jurymen filed Into the courtroom.
"We have, your Honor," replied Fore
man White: "we find the defendant not.
guilty."
OAKLAND, Oct. 9.â "We, the jury,
find the defendant not guilty by
reason of insanity."
Such was the verdict rendered

Charles G. Adams, the unfrocked Episco
pal clergyman, who shot and killed Dr.
JohnG. Jessup June 17 last in Berkeley.
The verdict was the result of twenty-five
minutes' deliberation, during which there
was a unanimous ' expression of opinion
among the Jurymen that the prisoner was
insane at the time of the fatal shooting. â¢
Two ballots were taken during the in
terval from 2:50 o'clock, when Judge Mel
vin finished his charge to the jury, and

At the close of the day the tally reports
from each hatch were turned into the of
lice. The difference between the two
hatches did not amount to very much,
but it was the grand total which raised
all the excitement in Chandler's office.
The big collier had been almost entirely
discharged. And the Mackinaw's stay in
port will be reduced by at least two days.
The work began as on ordinary occa
sions, but as bucket after bucket rose into
the air 'with unusually short intervals be
tween and with marvelous regularity,
people in the neighborhood realized that
something more than coal dust was in
the air.
A competition between union and non
union labor held yesterday during the dis
charging of the collier Mackinaw has set
employers of coal-heavers talking. The
gang delegated by Chandler & Co. to dis
charge the collier was composed of union
and non-union mon. The union men re
fused to associate with the others, but ac
cepted a compromise whereby the non
union men were relegated to one hatch
and the members of the union to another.
"Here's our chance to show the boss
what we can do," said the non-union men.
"Here's where we put it all over these
'scabs.' said the others, "and here's
where we make ourselves good and solid
with the old man."
XTN1ON VERSUS NON-UNION.

- The Justices of the Supreme Court leave
Saturday for a two weeks' session at Los
Angeles. The cases considered at that
time will be those affecting the southern
part of- the State.
In the present case it is not denied by the
defendant that he fired the pistol by which
the deceased was slain, but he claims, first,
that it was necessary in self defense, and to
repel a violent attack which the deceased was
then making upon him; second, that at the
time the fatal shot was fired the defendant
was so far disordered in his mind, .his reason
so far dethroned, that he is not responsible to
the law for his act.
If is. claimed by the defense that by reason
of the Ions continued indulgence in intoxi
cants thÂ« defendant, at the time he killed Dr.
Jessup, had reached that stage of chronic al
coholism where his brain was permanently
diseased and where the victim was rendered
Incapable of distinguishing right from wrong,
and where permanent general insanity had re
sulted. You are Instructed that a sane man
who voluntarily drinks and becomes intoxi
cated Is not\ excused of unlawful acts which
in his sober senses he would have avoided.
However, on the other hand, if one by reason
of long continued indulgence in intoxicants
l^as reached that stage of chronic alcoholism
where permanent general insanity has result
ed then in such a case he is no more legally
responsible for his acts ; than would be the man
congenltally ! insane, or Insane from violent
Injury to the brain. Therefore you are in
structed, if you find that the defendant.
Charles G. Adams, at the time of thla fatal
shooting was the victim of chronic alcohol
ism and irresponsible, then you must find
him not guilty. ' '. .
You are further instructed that if you find
that the deceased was slain by the defend
ant while he was manifestly endeavoring to
enter the defendant's house and doing so "in
a forcible manner and that the fatal shot
was fired to prevent the deceased from car
rying into execution his purpose, then it is
your duty to flrtH him not .guilty. When a
man is atttacked i in his own house he is not
bound to retreat from it. He stands at bay
and may turn and kill his -assailant If it Is
necessary to save his own life. In this sense,
and in this sense alone, are we to understand
the maxim that every man's house is his
castle. An assailed person â so we may para
phrase the maximâ is not bound to retreat out
of his own house to avoid violence, even
though a retreat may be safely made.

the cause of outbreak, is proving itse'f the
most helpful agency for the re-establishment
of peace and national unity.
The period since the raising cf the siege of
Peking has been marked by various incidents:

with calmness, foresight and great prudence;

DEATH'S LATEST LIST
IN THE PHILIPPINES
It was said at the Navy Department
that the reports of misconduct on the part
of Captain Tilley have emanated for the
most part from Samoan missionaries.
Rear Admiral Silas Casey will proceed to
Tutuila aboard his flagship, the Wiscon
sin, and investigate the charges presented
against the captain. Navy Department
officials are very loth to believe the stor
ies of unbecoming conduct preferred
against him.
Acting Secretary Hackett has directed
the commander in chief of the Pacific
squadron to proceed to Samoa and to as
certain the truth with regard to the
charge, and if necessary to hold a court
for the trial of Captain Tilley.
The department has., detached Captain
Tilley from command of the Abarenda
and of the station and ordered him to
proceed by ih*i next steamer for San
Francisco from Tutuila.
The charges, it is proper to say, were
received at the department with surprise,
since the record of Captain Tilley hith
erto has been unblemished. The admlnle
tration of his office, as reported offlcially
from time to time, has been eminently
satisfactory. There has been no ground
for supposing that this officer's conduct
was anything other than what it should
have been.
WASHINGTON. Oct. have
reached the Navy Department from Tu
tuila, Samoa, complaining- of the conduct
of Captain Tillcy. commandant of that
station.. It is alleged that on more than
one occasion the commandant has been
seen, under the influence of liquor and
that his conduct was unbecoming an of
ficer. ,*

MISSIONARIES
MAKE PROGRESS
B A. Hyde, living at 212 Mission street,
tv.is the victim of an unusually bold rob
bery shortly before 5 o'clock last evening.
Hyde was walking along Third street and
Â«rhÂ«i near Mission he was attacked by
r-t"? men. one of whom pointed a pistol
rit his head and threatened to blow It 'oft
If ho made an outcry. After knocking
Mm down and brutally kicking him the
â¢;<->perate men searched his pockets, tak
ing his watch and chain and a 'email
-mount of money. The assault and rob
b Â»>â¢ v.as witnessed by a number of peo
ple, but no attempt was made to prevent
â¢-<â¢ men from carrying out their bcM
crime. Hyde has given the police a good
Ascription of the robbers and every ef
fort is being made to approhend them
In telling his story of the robbery Hydo
?:dd:
After rasfing Howard street on my way
home I noticed two of my assailants following
rr.e. but not thinking that they Intended in
held roe up I continued leisurely along thÂ«
street. When within a few feet of Mission
.<:ie <-<f '.he men who had been following me
thrust a revolver in my face and ordered me
M throw up my hands. Before I could cera
v'.y vttB the demand two trttier men attacked
rr.e from behind. After felling me with a
!>;ow in the back of the head they repeatedly
lacked me and then took my purse and money.
\ Co not know the men. but I am satisfied that
T vlll be able to identify them in case they
: ; re trrened.
Hyde describes the robber who thrust the
rietol into his face as belnp tall and roughly
\u25a0 !r*"SFed. He hart several weeks' growth or
Veard on his face.
After they passed Forest no one '3
known to have seen the two fishermen,
but two soldiers from Fort Baker re
ported last night that they had seen tfcn
upturned boat in the strait. The tus
McDowell, which picked up the boat, car
ried it to Mieggs Wharf, where It wa*
was identified by Captain Charles A.
Neill as the property of Forest. When
the boat capsized It is supposed the an
chor fell out, causing it to come to a
â¢quapiooc aqj jo aDBid am jb unspuEjs
Nels Nelson, the man from whom the
two men rented the boat at Forest's boal
house and who is probably the last ma:>
who saw them alive, can give but a
meager description of the two men. He
says both men were between the asje.-*
of twenty and twenty-five years. Both
were of medium height. One had a slight
ly red face and a scanty sandy mustache,
while his companion's mustache was dark.
The one with the sandy mustache wore :i
brown suit. Both were fairly well dressed
and were apparently out for a day's rec
reation.
The men rented a sixteen-foot boat and
also hired their fishing lines at the boat
house. As they were rowing toward the
fishing ground they met Forest, the
owner of the boat. One of the men
greeted him by calling out. "Hello, cap
tain." It is certain that the men did not
belong In Sausalito and from the fact that
they apparently knew Forest it is believed
they frequently visited Sausalito for a
day's outing.
When the boat was picked up nothing
was in it but tne fish lines which the two
men had taken with them, which were
badly tangled. It is supposed that when
the men reached the point where their
boat was found the swirling tide proves*
too much for them and capsized their
boat. As it is considered impossible for
even the strongest swimmer to keep afloat
at that point in the strait it is supposed
that the men were drowned and carried
away by the tide.
Two men whose identity has not yet
been ascertained probably met death in
the tide rip off Cavallo Point, on tho
Marin shore, yesterday afternoon. The
men rented a boat at Charles Forest's
boathouse at Sausalito shortly before
noon yesterday, stating that they wished
to go for a fishing trip In tne vicinity ol"
Lime Point. This was the last seen all
them. At about 5:30 o'clock in the after
noon the Government tug McDowelt
found their upturned boat anchored 1Q<>
yards. oft Cavallo Point, which is near
Lime Point. * .

coaching party arrived at the Holland
House at 1:32 o'clock this (Thursday)
morning after a trip to Philadelphia and
return in less than twenty-two hours.
James H. Hyde held the reins when the
coach drew up in front of the Holland
House, Fifth avenue and Thirtieth street.
He said that the trip was a big success.
as well as the fastest and smoothest
coaching trip of Its kind. He gave as the
official time 1:27 o'clock at the finish. Ac
cording to the schedule the coach should
have arrived at the Holland House at
10:30 o'clock last night.
Vanderbilt's .Coaching Exploit.
Senator Cockrell asked him why he had
not testified to this before, as it was a
very important matter. Major Hawkes
said he had never said anything to any
of the persons about the case. Under
close questioning Major Hawkes admitted
he had said to Judge Boyd that he was
not to pay for the stock, or "words to that
effect." He was asked what reply Judge
Boyd made, and said he answered that It
v^Â» all right, or "words to that effect-'*
Replying to questions by Senator Cock
rell, Major Hawkes said he had been on
very friendly terms with Judge Boyd and
would have spared him if possible. He
added that he was much disappointed In
the evidence given by the several wit
nesses before the committee.
"Don't you think they have sworn to the
truth?" inquired Senator Cockrell.
"I do not." retorted Hawkes, hotly.
Several witnesses who had testified dur
ing the hearing were recalled, but nothing
of particular interest was developed. At
the close of to-day's hearing the commit
tee held a brief executive session â¢ and
then announced an adjournment until No
vember 18.
Major Hawkes, in correcting his* testi
mony, had added a statement that Judge
Boyd was not to subscribe for hemp stock,
but was to receive it for the use of hia
name. This called out several questions
as to the division of stock, and Hawkes
said it was understood that the names of
the other persona were not to appear on
the stock books. To avoid this ft was
agreed between himself and Heistand that
the $150,000 of stock was to be carried in
Hawkes' name.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.â When the Sen
ate Committee on Military Affairs to-day
resumed its hearing of the charges against
Lieutenant Colonel Heistand Major
Hawkes, the prosecuting -witness, was
called to submit some evidence In rebuttai
which he desired to present.

: The United Labor party came near be
v ing denied a place on the official ballot
by the Board of Election
yesterday. The petition, presented by 4 the
party purported to be signed by- ?052 elec
tors, but an investigation by the Regis
trar's deputies developed the fact that 699
of the signers were not on the great reg
ister. This left 2353 bona fide signers, but
further investigation showed that out of
five sub-petitions one-sixth of 1 per cent
of the signers had voted at the last pri
mary and testified their allegiance to one
or other of the two great political par
ties. It was figured that this would re
,duce the 2353 signers by at least 150 votes,
but this was not taken into account by
the commission. As only 1955 signers were
required, the commission decided that th$
applicants had filled all the requirements
and so accorded the candidates of the
United Labor party a place on the ticket.

lt will require 150,000 ballots to supply
the demands in San Francisco. That is

ordered 310 re"ams at $2 50 per ream, and
was informed that there were only five
reams left in the custody of the Secretary
of State. If there were 500 sheets to the
ream there would be a margin of 5C03 to
operate upon, but as the count is usually
short Registrar Walsh does- not know
what to do. as printers and pressmen
sometimes spoil a few sheets of paper.
"Any way you figure this proposition,"
said Registrar Walsh yesterday, "leaves
us no margin. The paper Is fifteen inches
wide by twenty-five inches long;, if you
reverse the paper is twenty-flve Inches
long and fifteen inches wide. We have to
take the shorter side to print the tickets,
as they will exceed twelve and a half
inches in length. Instead of being able to
Secretary of State Curry is reported to
be short of the "butter paper" he fur
nishes according to law to municipalities
for official ballots. Registrar Walsh has
been trying to figure out how he can fix
up the municipal ballot in accordance
with law and give to each party a top of
column position. He has until Tuesday,
next to arrange the ballot.
The independent candidate who seeks a
place on the ticket is in, a bad fix. Elim
ination is the order of the day. One in

the official axe, and Dr. Leland, the pres
ent Coroner, has declined to run for the
unexpired term. This helps the Registrar
out a little bit. but the size of the ticket
is against him.
Under the law each party must be
placed under a separate and parallel
heading. This will give the Republican,
Democratic and Socialist parties a head
ing. The fourth column will be headed
"Independent" and sub-headed "Union
Labor Party." The law is particular as
to the size of type and the space between

is a mortise on the ticket which will per

The ashes of the late Charles Levy,
who died at Stockton on Tuesday, were
cast, in accordance with his dying re-
Quest, to the four winds of heaven from
the top gallery of the Cliff House yes
terday. The ceremony was solemnly con
ducted at the hour designated by Levy
on his dying bed. The sun, sinking in
the western horizon, cast a golden glow
over sea and land when the executors
of the dead man appeared on the balcony
bearing the urn which contained all that
was mortal of the deceased. It was care
fully opened and when the flaming orb
sank below the distant water line its con
tents were cast forth.
The remains of the deceased were in
cinerated at Odd Fellows' Crematory dur r
ing the afternoon under the supervision
of Executors Arthur L. Levinsky and
Henry Eshbach. When the ashes were
I turned over to them they departed, for
the Cliff House together with R. Gnekow
; and Thomas E. Cooney, old friends of the
deceased. Upon their arrival at the Cliff j
House they met John D. Spreckels and j
Herman Oelrichs, to whom they com- ;
municated the object of their \isit. The
executors â¢ expressed their reluctaYice to
the performance of the task imposed upon
them, whereupon Mr. Spreckels as well
as Mr. Oelrichs consented to participate
In the ceremony. The party then ascended
to the topmosj. balcony facing the ocean |
\u25a0 and there, in pursuance of the provisions I
of Levy's will and of his repeated re- '
quests made during his lifetime, the pale I
ashes were wafted forth to the breeze. |
The telegrams . published yesterday
stated that Levy was anxious that his
ashes should not be cast to any breeze
that blew in the direction of Stockton,
.the inference being that he had no love j
for the city In which he won a comfort- j
able fortune as a peddler. Executor Le- |
vlnsky denies this emphatically. He says
that Levy loved Stockton and her people
and that his Bole reason for requiring his
e shes to be scattered in this city was to
relieve the executors of the task of carry
ing them to Stockton after the cremation.
Levy was an old bachelor and some
what eccentric. He left a considerable
estate, which Is divided among relatives,
some of whom, it is stated, live in this
city. Be that as it may none of these
were present at the ceremony described. |
The application of M. J. White, secre
tary of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, for letters of guard
ianship over the person of Nellie Allen, a
14-year-old girl, was heard by judge Cof
fey yesterday. The child is a member of
the Biter household at San Rafael, where
she has been living for four years. Mrs.
Biter is opposed to the transfer of the
custody of the child to White* and wants
to be appointed the guardian.
Secretary White contends that the Biter
home is not the proper place for the girl.
The members of various prevention of
cruelty societies and residents of San Ra
fael testified yesterday that Mrs. Biter
was a fit person to have control of the
child, and the little girl told the Judge
that she wanted to remain where she was.
The Biters are vegetarians, and this is
one of the reasons advanced by White for
the removal of the child. Drs. Mattner
and Lyford testified yesterday that a
vegetable diet was not injurious but ben
eficial to young people.
Several witnesses testified to the man
ner in which the Biters conducted their
home, and the case was then continued
until October 18.

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 9.â The Secretary
of State has between 100 and 110 reams of
ballot paper left, after having filled San
Francisco's order for 305 reams. Sacra
mento will use ten or fifteen reams in No
vember. Clerks in the Secretary of
State's office say that . there is enough
paper for all purposes.
Deny Story of Scarcity.
When Secretary of State Curry sent
down the same quality of "butter paper"
last year, at the same price charged this
year, the Board of Supervisors refused
to pay the bill. This year Secretary of
State Curry demanded cash in advance.
As there was no option lef^the Board of
Election Commissioners ordered the pay
ment of .the money. The paper is here,
but the Commissioners do not know what
to do with it, especially if mistakes are
made in the printing. As the matter
stands the printer who has the contract
for printing the ballots is about as badly
off as the Registrar of Voters.

from Washington, D. C, will sail
shortly to resume his seat on the

that eclipses any machine of its kind ever

Some of the answers made by the Judge
are very sensational. In reference to the
charge that he still continued to hold a
large Interest in the Republican after he
took his seat on the bench, he says, after
stating that he did all in his power to
sell his stock:
About January and about March, 1901, I was
negotiating: for the sale of my Interest, and
that of my mother-in-law, in said paper. In
each Instance the sale was not consummated
because, on each occasion, the Advertiser (the

of Victor H. Olmstead, special investi
gator sent from Washington.
" From the most trustworthy information
obtainable the opinion is derived that the
association of liquor dealers will indorse
for Mayor either Wells or Schmitz. The
latter seems to have a slight preference.
Tobin for some reason is hardly consid
ered in the race for the indorsement,
whatever his chances may be in the gen
eral contest for public favor.
A meeting, of the association was held
recently at the headquarters of the or
ganization, 214 California street. Repre
sentatives were present from the various
organizations comprising the .association
and a lively discussion ensued of the pros
pects of an interesting campaign. An as
sessment sufficient to cover the expenses
of. preliminary arrangements for the cam
paign was levied and promptly met by all
the organizations represented - at the
meeting. â¢ .
The liquor dealers are not doing â¢poli
tics, but business. No distinctions are
made as t,o politics. All the candidates
for the Mayoralty, the City Attorneyship
and the flfty-four candidates for Super
visors will be carefully canvassed and a
few days before election every liquor deal
er in the city will be notified as to the
men who have been indorsed.
There will be ' no indorsing of Police
Judges, as there is a feeling that all the
men nominated are "liberal."
The candidates for office begin to per
ceive that they must get out and make
an active individual canvass in order. to
achieve success at the polls. The loyal
supporters of the grand old Republican
party and the indorsers of the time hon
ored principles of Thomas Jefferson seem
to fancy that this is an off season in poli
tics and a good time for. the best man to
win. The taxpayers are > making inquiry
regarding the . candidates for the Board
of Supervisors. The leading candidates
for Mayorâ Asa R. Wells, Joseph S. Tobin
and Eugene E. Schmitzâ are fairly well
known to the voting population, but many
of the nominees for Supervisors are un
known outside of their respective dis
tricts. Property owners and other citi
zens who are deeply interested In the
prosperity of the city deem it essential
that the best men available should be
chosen for Supervisors.
There will be a liquor dealers' ticket In
the field again this year. It/ will be put
out a few days before election by the San
Francisco Protective Association,, an or
ganization made up of delegates from the
German Saloonkeepers' Association, the
Retail Grocers' Association, the Beer Bot
tlers' Association, the Soda Water Bot
tlers' Association, the Retail Liquor Deal
ers" Association, the Barkeepers' Associa
tion and the, Grocers' Union. These or
ganizations cover the local field of liquor
dealers. For the last eight years they
have been working as a unit at election
times as the San Francisco Protective As
sociation.
