ROCEFORD. 111.. Dec. IS."â Failure on
the part of a conductor to obey orders Is
supposed to have been the cause ot a
head-end collision on the Illinois Central
Railroad, between Irene and Perryville,
early to-day. The two trains were east
bound passenger train No. 4 and a freight
train from Chicago going westward. Eight
people are dead or missing and eleven in
jured. The known dead are:
RICHARD ORMSBY. Chicago, engineer
of passenger train.
JAMES REARDOX. Freeport, fireman
of the passenger train.
ROBERT THOMPSON'. DubuQue, Amer

J. W. FUNK, Chicago, brakeman of
passenger train.
DAVID BEHAX, Freeport. engineer of
freight.
EDTVARD CARET, Freeport, freight

Missing and supposed to be dead: News
boy on passenger train, name unknown;
section foreman from Irene, name un
known.
The seriously Injured, so far as names
could be ascertained, are: H. G. Well

bow, taken to Rockford City Hospital,
condition critical; D. R. Abrredent, Chi
cago, cut and bruised; J. H. Qulnlan, pas

and hair ecorched off.
Crash Together at Full Speed.
The trains met In a slight bend fn the
track, both running at full speed. The
smoker, express and baggage cars were
piled on the locomotives, pinning down the
occupants. Only three of the half-dozen
persons in the baggage car escaped. The
others were penned in, and If not roasted
to death were" Instantly killed and their
bodies entirely consumed. All efforts of
the survivors to rescue the victims were
â¢unavailing. The flames drove them back
at every point
The temperature was 20 degrees below
zero and an Icy wind was blowing across
the prairie, the point where the wreck oc
fetirred, a shallow cut, affording no protec
tion. The Injured were without hats and
suffered terribly. By the united efforts of
the survivors the way â  car was â¢ pushed
back from the wreckage to escape the
flames and the injured were placed on the
bunks inside.
Two hours elapsed before any relief was
at hand. Then an engine arrived from the
east and pulled the way car to Irene,
three miles distant. A relief train from
Rockford arrired at the scene of the
wreck at 10:50 a. m. In the meantime the
Injured had been brought back from Irene

' Fruitless.
Special Dispatch to The Call
REDWOOD CITY, Dec. 15.â Coroner
Crowe took the body of Louie Decrouix,
the young man who was found dead in a
boat at Millbrae on Friday, to San Fran
cisco to-day. I-ast night the body â¢was
Identified by two brothers of the deceased.
They state that there is another brother
ttill missing and fear that he has met the
tame fate. In" speaking about the mat
ter this morning August Decrouix said:
"My two young/ brothers, Louie and
Freddie, and my sister resided with my
father and mother' at Bay View, at what
is known as Bulchertown, in San Fran
cisco. * Louie was 25 years old and Fred
die v.as IS. They had been engaged in
digging clams in the creeks about Red
wood, Eelmont, San llateo and Millbrao
for the laEt six or seven years. They
would, go out and sometimes be gone for
a week at a time, though generally it was
only for a day or two.
"A. week ago Friday they started out in
their sailboat, and with them was a man
whose name I do not know. On the next
Thursday my folks saw this man. who
had returned the previous day. As the
boys did not, come home with him they
began to worry. The man acted very
strangely. When he was asked where thÂ«
boys \ver% he appeared confused ani
nervous. He told my father and mother
that he returned Wednesday morning am!
had left the boys in the creek. Later he
told my sister that he returned Wednes
day night and left them in another place.
"On Saturday morning I started out In
a gasoline launch with six other men to
look for the boys. This man started out
Friday night for the saine purpose. We
went up all the creeks but could not fjnti
any trace of the boys, nor did we see any
thing of this man. When we returned
yesterday afternoon the man was not
back. I saw the article in yesterday's Call
and came to Redwood last night. At the
Morgue 1 identified the body as that of my
brother. .
"My father told me that my brothers
had been having trouble with some Ital
ians. My brother could not have' been
drowned,- for he would not have been In
the boat. I b'elieve he was murdered, and
1 will pVt the matter in the hands of the
police."
It is thought here that the body of. the
missing man will be discovered in a day
or two and that developments may show
that a double crime has been committed.
Thene are bruises upon the body, of the
dead man, but they may have- been in
flicted after death. One peculiar thins
about the matter is that the mast and
sail of the boat in which the boys started
out are missing. The inquest will be- held

taid by Higglns to have disobeyed orders
to step at Irene, several miles east of
Perry ville. Higgins said of the wreck:
"The passenger train was delayed by
the cold weather and it was three hours
and forty minutes late when the freight
train going east reached Coleman, forty
miles west of Chicago. Coleman is the
passing point for the two trans. The
engineer of the freight train was in
structed that the passenger train was
late and it was his duty to sidetrack at
Irene, which he neglected to do.
"Employes aboard the trains say that
both were running at foil speed and that
the shock was terrible. It seems there
were three distinct blows, due to the re
coil. It is said they were thrown down
three times in rapifl succession. The pas
senger train and a large part of the
freight were demolished, with the two
locomotives."
Rapid Spread of Flames.
Conductor Quinlan of the passenger
train was able to-night to talk of the
wreck. He said:
"We were trying to make up lost time
when suddenly there was a crash, throw-
ing us all to the front of the car. I man
aged to clear myself from under the seat
where I was thrown, and finding two men
close by tried to release them. This I
was unable to do, and as they did not re
spond to my caJls I escaped through a
window, being scorched by the fire as I
crawled out, so quickly did the flames
spread. As I remember there were eight
men in the car, and 1 find that only two
of them got out. The rest were doubtless
burned in the wreck."
In their stories of the disaster all of
those who escaped dwelt upon the horror
of the fire and the rapidity with which
the wreckage was eaten up by the flames
Almost Instantly after the first terrific
crash an oil car close to the freight en
fine exploded, the oil adding fuel to the
flames. Persons who were attracted to
the fpot by the noise of the collision and
vhe glare of the flames were unable to
render the unfortunates any assistance
as the fire spread so rapidly that in less
than fifteen minutes the cars had been
consumed. Â«^=Â«

Disaster Occurred on

Special Dispatch to The Call,
SEATTLE, Dec. 15.â It Is now believed
by local mariners that the steam collier
Matteawan was' lost on the Flattery
rocks. Captain C. G. Conradi in tho
steamsnlp Centennial was followed by the
collier around that cape during the b:g
storm early in the month, and he states
that this is his belief. He bases the opin
ion in part on the fact that the Umatllli
reef lightship, which is regularly sta
tioned off these rocks, had broken loose
from her moorings and was not on her
usual spot to guid.e vessels away from the
dangerous place.
The Centennial on the afternoon of De
cember 4 passed around Cape Flattery.
The Matteawan was at the time scarcely
a mile away. The night before the Cen
tennial put to sea was a wild one. So
bad was the weather that when Captain
Conradi reached Port Angeles he feichei
harbor and remained over night. The
next night he started again for the Pa
cific. /
During the afternoon of that day he
met the lightship, which had broken from
her moorings. She was coming up th<s
straits and was to all appearances putting
for shelter in the Port Angeles harbor.
Late that afternoon the Cente m a', rounj
ed Flattery. So cjose behind her that th.i
smoke from her funnel could be seen
steamed the Matteawan.
Until the Centennial was midway be
tween Cape Flattery, and Flattery rocks
the Matteawan remained the same dis
tance in her wake. At that time dark
ness had long since fallen, and the light
from the Matteawan's smoke was all that
could be seen. That vanished about 9
o'clock in the evening. Until midnight'
the storm continued.
During the early hours cf the morning
of the 5th the wfnd abated and the s&is
commenced to grow "more regular. From
these facts Captain Conradi is of the
opinion that the big collier was lost be
tween 1 9 and 12 o'clock on the night of
December 4, and that in all likelihood she
went ashore and pounded to pieces on the
TJmatilla reef or Flattery rocks, by both
of which names the reef is known.

"I have been asked' why. a signal was
sent and not a message. Scientific men
will readily understand the reason. The
signal is much more satisfactory for ex
perimental purposes. The letter 'S'
consists simply of three dots and makes
an admirable signal. .
"Our receiving instruments are very
sensitive and had to be readjusted con
tinually. Under the circumstances,
messages would have been almost unin
telligible, as portions would necessarily
be omitted. ; '
; "It must be remembere'd also that ray

The signal was received only when the
kite was at a great height. Mv opinion
is, however, that a station here similar
to that at The Lizard, on the Cornwall
coast, with special machinery and a
mast 200 feet high, will be quite suffi
cient to make powerful communication
across the Atlantic.
. "Another question asked is why I did
not connect with the Cape Cod station.
The answer is simple: This station is
not yet ready, and, beside, I preferred
making tests .over a longer distance.
"I don't expect to obtain any further
great results from the kite tests and
must wait till a mast is erected. I be
lieve that we would have done better
with a balloon than with a kite, but un

ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION MYSTERY
BAFFLES THE MARIN AUTHORITIES
Evidence Found on the Ground Near Adolph Sylva's Residence in Sausalito
Shows That the Missile Hurled Toward One of the Windows a Mid
night Was a Mechanical Contrivance Containing a Powerful Explosive
SAUSALITO, Dec. 15.â The' mystery
that enshrouds the attemptvmade
at an early hour yesterday morn-,
ing to accomplish the assassina
tion of Adolph Sylva by means of
an Infernal machine remains as impene
trable as It was at the time it first came
to the knowledge of the officers of th-s
law.
The vigorous efforts _ made by the
authorities to-day to discover a trace of
the would-be assassin or to assign a mo
tive" for his fiendish action have alike
proved fruitless. Conjecture, treads, tho
heel of conjecture, but to no satisfactory,
conclusion. The political unpopularity of
the intended 'victim and his recent contro
versy with the poolroom men furnish ma-,
lerial for surmise, and It is generally,
agreed that on these may rest, the reason
for the crime. l â  , - â¢ cf"-"'.T
Sylva Sorely Puzzled.
But Sylva declares that' his life had not
openly been threatened, and his fnenas
say that even granting the justice or tne
severest criticism to which he has been
subjected no sufficient cause could have
existed to blow him up in the middle or
the night by the use of dynamite. - -.
An examination of the grounds near. the
Sylva house revealed the fact that the in
strument designed for the destruction of
the occupants had in it some mechanical
contrivance. ' Scattered about â¢ the yard,
and under the tree, which stayed the
force of the projectile, was found a great
number of fragments, evidently parts of a
small machine. Among them were por
tions of screws, bits of wire, vestiges of
steel springs and a section of metal p*ate.
The officers also discovered hundreds or
small pieces of a gunny sack, which had
undoubtedly contained the deadly missile.
The sack had been rent into shreds by
the explosion, and nearly all of the frag
ments arÂ£ partially burned. The purpose
of the assassin In enveloping his destruc
tive device in a sack is not clearly under
stood.
Evidence of Footprints.
From footprints found in a vacant lot
evidence was gathered that the miscreant
stood about thirty-five feet away from the
house when he hurled the explosive.- The
night was very dark, and it is presumed
that he could not see the tree which, in
terrupted the line between his position
and the window of Sylva's room. In any
event, it was the tree that probably saved,
the life oX Sylva. The terrific explosion
converted it into a Heap of matchwood.
A few of the windows were broken, but
the. residence suffered no serious damage.
Sylva has employed detectives to work
pn- the case, and declares that, he will
spare no effort to fathom the mystery
and have the culprit sent to the peniten
tiary. Meanwhile the greatest precau
tions are being taken against a repeti
tion of the crime. The people of the town
are greatly agitated over the sensational
affair and are extremely anxious that the
person or persons concerned in the at
tempt af assasination should speedily be
arrested and visited with the severest
penalty the law provides.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â Discussing to
night Signor Marconi's , announcement
that he has established wireless communi
cation between St. Johns, Newfoundland,
and Cornwall, England, Rear Admiral
Bradford of the naval bureau of equip
ment said:
"I feel skeptical about Signor Marconi's
claim. The slight results he did obtain
minght have come from atmospheric dis
turbances. /There are such things as elec
trical storms, and they often affect tele
graph wires. Wireless telegraph instru
ments are so sensitive that they are very
easily affected. A thunder storm in Maine
is not felt ' in Washington and the feeble
efforts of man are not comparable with
the tremendous force exerted by nature.
Signor Marconi claims to have received a
signal over 1700. miles â a distance three
times as great as that from here to
Maine." . . ... - ,
COMMITNICATION WITH
MARS NOT IMPROBABLE
Astronomer Serviss Says Marconi
Has Opened the Way to Vast
. Possibilities.
NEW YORK, Dec. 16.â The Journal pub
lishes the following: Garrett P. Serviss,
astronomer, says it may occur to many
to ask: "How, now,~about interplanetary
communication? ' Does Mr. Marconi's new
achievement . render it any more likely
that we shall some time be able to send
messages to Mars?" â¢>*.
The reply is that if Mr. Marconi's elec
tric undulations can be sent to any dis
tance, independent of the presence of the
earth and atmosphere, then his recent
achievement has a most important bear
ing upon the question of communicating
with foreign worlds. Of course, the 17U0
or 1800 miles over which he has been able
to transmit signals is insignificant In com
parison with the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 miles
that" separate us, under the best of circum
stances, from Mars or Venus, but yet he
has gained so enormous a step at a single
effort that it seems hard to set a limit be
yond which these strange impulses cannot
reach.

hand, and Great Britain, the United
States and Japan on 'the other. The gov
ernment is helpless and will yield to that
faction able to bring the strongest press
ure to bear. *. " Â°
Prince Chlng is distinctly more frieudly
to Great* Britain than was Li Hung
Chang. The British, American and Jap
anese representatives here have separate
ly visited â  Prince Ching and insisted -that
they be shown any treaty before it is
signed. Prince Ching has submitted â¢ to
them the draft of a treaty ' practically
identical to the treaty already published.
Prince Ching is now pressing Russia for
more definite terms, the present form of
the treaty â  being so vague in its impor
tant points as virtually to , leave ' Russia
a. free hand. The Japanese Minister has
taken a strong stand in the. matter, and
has notified Prince Ching that Japan will
require concessions equivalent to all -the
advantages conceded to Russia in Man
churia. .â¢â .'-. â  â¢â  , â¢ â¢ ;
The belief -is general that Russia; in
tends to ignore what she regards as mere
formal objections on the part of t other
powers. Japan" would go to the length of
war to stop the Russian occupation of
Manchuria if she were assured of sup
port, but she will not risk a repetition
of the rebuff administered after: the
China-Japanese war.

ADOLPH SYLVA, THE SAUSALITO POLITICIAN, WHOSE LIFE AN AS

MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCE CONTAINING AN EXPLOSIVE.
Van . Asselt; "was made early yesterday
morning. An'exploslon of dynamite de
stroyed the rear wall of the building to

in the back yard. The proprietors of the
place are at a loss to explain the act and
do not know who committed the outrage.
The saloon was closed at 1 o'clock. Two
hours later a loud report was heard and
flames were seen shooting up from the
rear of the building. A number of Italian
laborers who were passing formed a
bucket brigade, getting water from the

FATE REUNITES
TWO BROTHERS
Men Separated for Thirty-
Years Meet in Wash

At Everett They Are Brought
Together Accident-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
.TACOMA, "Wash., Dec. 15.â Charles
Cato and A. O. Cato, two brothers who
separated in Sweden thirty years ago,
met again for the first time in an Ever
ett store yesterday. * , . T\\
A. O. Cato, who is the elder of the two.
kissed his small brother good-by in their
Swedish home just three decades ago.
Coming to America he prospered and
soon stopped writing home. All trace of
him was lost. Ten years later Charles
Cato came to this country with the
double object of making money and flnd
inT his brother. After repeated searches
he gave up tne quest long ago.
Now it appears that both men have been
living- In Everett for two years past. Tb/ey
were standing almost side by side Satur
day when a storekeeper called one of
them by name. His brother turned and in
an instant they recognized each other.
Fate had brought about their reunion
where an anxious search had failed.
NORTHERN LUMBERMEN
ABE JN SOBE STBAITS
Shortage of Railroad Cars Causes the
Loss of Thousands of
Dollars.
TACOMA. Dec. 15.â The lumbermen of
this State are making another determined
effort to secure from the Northern trans
continental roads cars enough to meet the
normal Eastern demand for fir lumber and
heavy timbers. All the big mills and
many small ones have been making loud
complaints that their business is being
seriously interfered with by the diversion
of lumber cars for grain carrying.
The railroad committee of the Pacific
Coast Lumber Manufacturers' Association
met here last night and decided to make
a vigorous appeal for more cars without
further delay. The members of the com
mittee state that orders amounting to
$250,000 to $300,000 have been lost by the
car shortage. It has been especially hard
to get flat cars for hauling high grade
timber. The lumbermen will also seek to
ship more lumber by steamers around
Cape Horn to Atlantic ports. % â¢ â¢'

MODESTO, Dec. 15.â At Clauston, a
small station on the Santa Fe railroad
in this county, two masked highwaymen
to-daiy tried to rob Japanese section
hands in a bunkhouse. The highwaymen
demaned money, which the Japanese
said they did not have. One of the Jap
anese grabbed an 'iron rod and started
for a highwayman. The bandit shot him
in the cheek and beat him on the head
with a pistol. Another Japanese was
also struck on the head with a pistol.
The highwaymen then escaped.

MAY DELAY ACTION ON THE CANAL
Morgan s Report in Favor of the Nicaraguan Route
Arouses Some Protest and an Attempt May Be
Made to Depose Him From the Chairmanship
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAV, 1406 G STREET N.
W\. WASHINGTON. Dec. 15.â There Is
likely to be trouble over the report which
Senator Morgan made to the Senate last
week as chairman of the committee on
interoceanic canals. In favor of the
Nicaragua Canal against the Panama
Canal, and reporting favorably the bill
authorizing the Government to go ahead
and get the land needed for the Nica
:.-i:an CanaL
The meeting; of the committee when
tlv? action was taken was attended by
oiA' two members on the Republican
si/^â Senators Hawley of Connecticut
ar.d Platt of New York. The committe
is really in the hands of the Democrats.
The Democratic members are Morgan of
Alabama, who is chairman; Harris of
Kansas, Turner of Washington and Cul
berson of Texas, all members of thfc
Democratic caucus, and Hawlev of Con
necdCBt. Sewell of New Jersey, Platt of
New York and Hanna of Ohio. Senator
Sev.cll is dying at his home.
Senator Morgan, In his report, was
very severe en the officers of the Pana
ma Canal Company and. in view of the
fp.ct that several members of the com
mittee were absent, it is said, some of the
Senators are in favor of having the re
port sent back to the committee. This
would be regarded by Senator Morgan as
a move in behalf of Panama and would
Â«5<;ubtless be characterized by him as
such.
Senators who are incensed at the man
ner in which the report was made do
not look at it in that light- They say
that they are not committed to either
route and that Congress, in the matter of
the expenditure of !1S9,000,000, ought at
least to wait until the report of the last
"Walker commission, which cost more
than $1,000,000. has been printed and
placed on the desks of the committee.
There may be a desire to delay action
in this, but they deny that they have any
â¢wish other than to get the best possible

The report that there is a movement
to retire Senator Morgan from the chair
manship of the committee is denied by
these Senators, but they do say that in
view of the fact that the Republicans
have to take the responsibility for legis
lation they should have control of the
committee. No one would be surprised
If In the rearrangement of the commit
tees the dominant party should be given

TO VOTE ON TREATY TO-DAY.
Senate Certain to Batify the Hay-
Pauncef ote Convention.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â The disposi
tion of the Senate Is to do very little busi
ness beyond acting upon the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty before adjournment for the
holidays. In accordance with the agree
ment on Friday the treaty will be voted
on before the Senate adjourns to-morrow.
Senator Teller will make the first speech
of the day to-morrow, and he will be fol
lowed by other Senators with brief
speeches. The opponents of the treaty
admit there is no doubt of ratification.
On Tuesday the announcement of the
changes in committees will be made, anu
there is a probability that after this an
nouncement the Senate will adjourn until
Thursday, when the adjournment for tho
holidays will take place, extending to
January 6. If there are business sessions
on Wednesday and Thursday Senator
Morgan will make an effort to obtain ac
tion on his bill authorizing the acquisition
of right of way for the Nicaraguan canal,
but Senators on the Republican side of the
chamber are inclined to postpone all Im
portant legislation until after tb,e holi
days.
There probably will be action before
the adjournment on Thursday on a num
ber of nominations, and the chances ate
that Attorney General Knox's nomination
will be among those to receive attention.
The introduction of resolutions bearing
on the case of Admiral Schley is also
among the probabilities, but no action in
that direction is expected for the present.
The House this week will pass the bill
to provide temporarily revenues for the
Philippine Islands, which was reported
from the Ways and Means Committee last
Friday. Under the agreement made gen
eral debate will extend throughout Tues
day and until 4 o'clock Wednesday, when
a vote will be taken.
There will be no opportunity to amend
the measure. There will be no break in
the party lines on both sides of the
House. McCall of Massachusetts, the Re
publican member of the Ways and Means
Committee who opposed the Porto Rican
bill during the last Congress, will speak
against the measure, and will be support
ed in his dissent from his Republican col
leagues by Littlefield of Maine and per
haps several other Republicans who op
posed the Porto Rican bill and who hold
that a similar issue is presented at this
time. On the Democratic side Robertson,
a member of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, will support the bill, and the re
mainder of the Louisiana delegation will
do likewise. Representing the cane sugar
Interests of their State, they are opposed
to concessions on sugar duties either from
the Philippines or Cuba. The general be
lief is that the bill will secure as many
Democratic votes as it loses votes on the
Republican side, and that the majority
in its favor when placed upon passage
will be about the Republican majority in
the House.
â¢ The complete remains of the mammoth
found in Siberia, now on the way to St.
Petersburg, are about three times the size
of a big elephant.

RAINSTORM AND DISASTROUS FLOODS
FOLLOW PENNSYLVANIA'S COLD WAVE
Damage to Railroad and Mining Country Will Reach Millions of Dollars,
and at Least Four Lives Are Known to Have Jteen LostâRivers Over
' .^flow'Banks and Hundreds of Factories and Residences Are Inundated
PHILADELPHIA. Dec. 15.â A storm
which for severity and dqptruc
tlveness has not been equalled In
this section In twenty-five years
visited Eastern and Central Penn
sylvania last night, causing unprecedent
ed damage and resulting in the loss of at
least four lives. The havoc in the south
ern region Is enormous, â¢ and the loss to
railroad and mining companies will
amount to millions of dollars. The
Schuylkill, Lehigh, Susquehanna and Ju
nlata rivers have risen as high as llfteen
feet above their levels, and all of their
tributaries have overflowed, inundating
the surrounding country in more than a
dozen counties.
Innumerable washouts have occurred on
the Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia and
Heading, the Northern Central, the Le
high Valley, the New Jersey Central and
the Lackawanna railroads. Bridges were
carried away and traffic is at a standstill.
The delegates to the convention of the
American Federation of Labor are storm
bound at Scranton, with no Idea of when
they will be able to leave. . .
The force of water weakened the sup
ports of a bridge spanning a creek near
Willlamsport, and as a result a freight
train was wrecked and three men were
killed. At one place a miner was swept
from a bridge and drowned.
In the Schuylkill Valley forty-eight
mines were flooded, and in the Lehigh
and Lackawanna regions the destruction
is equally great. Hundreds of mules were
drowned in the collieries, and it will be
weeks before many of the mines can re
sume operations.
Entire Town Is Submerged.
In some sections the water reached "the
second stories of dwellings, and the town
of Westmore, near Wilkesbarre. is sub
merged. Many of the residents have left
their homes in boats. Similar conditions
exist along the Juniata River, farmers
being compelled to abandon their homes.
The flood was rendered more disastrous
by the melting of the snow on the moun
tain sides. The storm broke with great
severity yesterday afternon after the rain
had been falling incessantly for several
days. At Pottsville and other places in
Schuylkill County ten inches of rain fell
in twenty-four hours. The high wind ac
companying the rain unroofed many
houses, and the Individual losses will be
considerable.
ALLENTOWN, Pa., Dec. 15.â The most
destructive flood in the Lehigh Valley
since 1862 started this morning at 3 o'clock,
following a two days' drenching rain,
which melted the snow in the mountains,
causing the Lehigh River to become a
raging torrent. The traction company's
power-houses are flooded by seven feet of
water, which drowned the fires under the
boilers. No trolley cars have been run
since 10 o'clock this morning, and Allen
town is to-night in darkness. The Ade
laide silk mills sustained a loss of more
than $40,000. Eight feet of muddy water
is on the first floor, completely covering
the machines and ruining all the silk. The
American Steel and Wire Company's wire
and nail plants are under water and thou
sands of dollars damage has been done
there. All other industries along the
course of streams suffered heavily by
water flooding the basements and first
floors, damaging the machinery and stock.
Bethlehem, Pa., Dec. 15.â in six
hours this morning the Lehigh River
overflowed the canal and adjoining rail
road tracks on both sides. Both the Le
high Valley and the New Jersey Central
railroads were forced to suspend traffic.
Not since 1SH has the backwater from the
river wrought such serious damage. The
canal bank bosses say the damage to the
canal will reach $30,003, while 200 private
residences in the flooded district were
damaged to the extent of $50,000. Both the
electric and gas companies are without
power and the churches were compelled
to suspend services to-night.
The Lehigh River was seventeen feet
above low water mark here before the
people .realized their danger. No loss of
human life is known. .

REJECTS PORTION
OF CHILE'S NOTE
Argentine Republic to
Forward Its Reply
To-Day.
BUENOS AYRES, Dec. 15.â Although
the situation between Argentina and
Chile has improved, it has not yet been
clearly defined. The Council of Argentina
has spent much time In studlng'tho two
paragraphs of the Chilean note which de
lines that country's position and an agree
ment upon which will mean the solution
of the pending dlfllculty. Its reply will be
forwarded to-morrow.
The council has decided to accept the
first paragraph , concerning the construc
tion of roads. This paragraph Is satisfac
tory to the Argentine Republic. The com
pilation of the second paragraph, refer
ring to the pretended occupation by the
Argentine Republic of Chilean territory at
Ultima Esperanza, Is not acceptable to the
Ministers. The assurance Is given that the
Argentine Government, replying to this
paragraph, will answer that it is Impossi
ble for it to recognize an t ct which, after
in veatigation, has been disproved.'
The hope prevails here that everything
will be arranged on a friendly basis within
a few days. It is believed that Chile will
insist upon presenting an insignificant
claim for the invasion of Chilean terri
tory by three Argentine policemen.
Argentina continues taking military
measures. Men of wealth are offering the
Government money with which to buy
horses and otherwise equip, should occa
sion arise, a regiment of cavalry. Public
opinion throughout the entire country is
expressing its patriotic approval of the
Government's conduct. The people remain
quiet.
The Government has decided to divide
the republic into six military zones, with
20,000 men in each. The arms and equip
ment for these men are already on hand
in the respective zones. Over and above
the reserves called out last week, .15,000
volunteers have presented themselves for
service. In case of necessity, the Govern
ment has reserves which would enable it
to mobollze an army of 200,000 men.
PARIS, Dec. 15.â The Temps, reviewing
the dispute between the Argentine Repub
lic and Chile, says that what complicates
the questior is the vigilance, not to say
jealousy/with which the United States
remains faithful to the two-edged Monroe
doctrine, which excludes all other inter
vention, while justifying its own, and
watches for the interference of Great
Britain or other powers in the affairs of
South America.
La Liberte declares that an Argentina
Chilean war would just suit the American
Imperialism and that it would entirely suit
the designs of those working to pervert
the Monroe doctrine.
Identifies the Stolen Jewelry.
KANSAS CITY, Dec. 15.â Alfred Lowen
thal, the New York jewelry salesman
who was robbed of samples valued at
$15,000 at Portland, Ore., three weeks ago,
to-day identified the $800 worth of jewelry
recovered by the Kansas City, Kas., poi
lice department, as being a part of the
stolen property. Lowenthal asserts that
W. H. Wood, who is under arrest at
Omaha charged with complicity In the
robbery, is innocent. ' . v .
COLD weather and
floods east of the
Rocky Mountains have
caused heavy loss in life and
property. In Pennsylvania
a rise in the temperature has
been followed by Hoods that
are causing trjfnendoits dam
age, while in the Middle
Western and mountain
States the losses sustained by
stockmen will be enormous.
Latest zveather reports indi
cate that the cold wave has
about spent its force.
est day Chicago experienced in the month
of December since the weather j bureau
was established here thirty years ago.
For three hours this morning the mer
cury stood at 12 degrees below zero.
Later, however; the skies cleared and the
wind, which, had been blowing from the
northwest, died down, pausing a_gradual
rise of temperature. To-night the ther
mometer at the local weather bureau reg
istered but 3 degrees below zero. The pre
dictions for â¢to-morrow are moderate
weather and a rising temperature.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Dec. .; 15.â Reports
from the blizzard-stricken^ district of
Southern Wyoming are to the effect that
the great storm which has raged, for the
past few days with unprecedented, fury
has spent its force and that the
is slowly moderating. Rumors of loss of
life through exposure to. the storm^aie
numerous and in several. instances have
been confirmed. One of the latest tells
>of the death of a young man; named
Hemingway, who left, the home of his
brother in Casper, Wyo., to go^to a neigh
boring ranch on Thursday last. He never
reached his destination and is believed
to have perished. Meager reports" from
the range country are to the effect that
stock weathered the storm much better
tuan was expected, although the. loss will
undoubtedly be great. It will be several
days before conditions in the stock-rais
ing sections are known.
BILLINGS, Mont., Dec. 15.â Eastern
Montana has been enveloped In one of
the heaviest snowfalls ever known â¢ here.
The snow averages from two to six feet
in depth on the level and railroad travel
will be Interrupted for the next few days.
The thermometer registers 20 degrees be
low zero to-night, with a strong north
wind blowing, which will drive it from
10 to 20 degrees lower by morning. All
stock on the open prairie Is suffering
frightfully, and unless "weather changes
come within the next twenty-four hours
the losses /will be great. J. A. Phillips,
a well-kndwn sheepman, left here Friday
for Flat Willow, forty-five miles from
here, accompanied by two herders, and a
report reached Billings to-day that the
entire party were frozen to death en
route.
DENVER, Col., Dec. 15.â The tempera
ture here rose to between 30 and 40 de
grees above zero to-day, a welcome
change from yesterday's condition,-* when
the thermometers registered as low as 21
degrees below on the streets of Denver.
To-night the mercury rests around freez
ing point. A moderation of the cold
weather is reported from other sections
of the State, although not quite so de
cided as. a general rule as, in this city.
But little suffering is : reported as a result
of the storm in Colorado. ' â 
TOPEKA, Kas., Dec. 15.â Temperatures
in Kansas have risen from 10 to 30 de
grees since last night. The wind is from
the south to-night and the indications are
that by to-morrow the weather will be
much warmer. The situation of the stock
POLICEMEN MAKE
A GOOD CAPTURE
Arrest Two Men for Com
% plicity in Montana
Train Robbery.
KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Dec. 15.-A man
who, the police say, is tho one who shot
two KnoxvlUe policemen Thursday night,
and who ' they first thought was Harry
Longbaugh, but now believe Is Harvey
Logan, alleged to havo been concerned
In the Montana train robbery, was cap
tured with a companion to-night one mile
from Jefferson City, Tenn., twenty miles
from KnoxvlUe. Tho escape of the man
that shot the policemen was followed by
the discovery of a flood of unsigned $20
Montana bank notes, and on the person
of the man arrested to-day was found
over $5000 of tho stolen bills. A. B. Carey,
a Jefferson City merchant, telephoned po
lice headquarters In this city this after
noon that he believed he had seen the
much-wanted man and a companion in
Jefferson City. Local officers hurried to
the Bcene by special train but arrived too
late to participate In the capture. Carey
and four other men first caught a man
who gives his name aa John Drees of
Louisville. The other one was found In
a patch of woods one mile away. He was
slow In putting up his hands, but finally
surrendered. When taken he give his
name as Wilson. Both men were brought
here to-nleht.
Police officers are almost certain that
they ' have both Longbaugh and Harvey
Logan. Wilson fills Logan's description
precisely, except that he Is clean shaven
Instead of having a full beard. On his
head are scars which the local officers
say were made by the policemen's clubs
Drees about answers Longbaugh's de
scription. The man who gives his name
as Wilson absolutely refuses to talk, says
he has no name and does not know how
he received the scars on his head. Drees
claims to be a molder by trade. .

ST. PAUL, Dec. 15.â The report of the
weather bureau to-night contains the In
formation that the- backbone of the cold
wave has been broken. From all of the
stations in, the far Northwest come re
ports that there has been a decided rise
In temperature. Sub-zero weather con
tinues to be reported, however, but not
In such intense character as was shown
by the map in the last twenty-four hours.
In St. Paul to-day the . maximum was 8
below, and at 8 o'clock the thermometer
showed 4 degrees above.
OMAHA, Dec. 15.â The extreme cold
weather which has prevailed for forty
eight hours in Nebraska and the Missouri
Valley began to moderate this afternoon.
The minimum temperature to-day was 14
degrees below zero, which point was
reached at 7 this morning. At 10 o'clock
to-night it had risen to 16 above, with
prosoects for a further rise.
CINCINNATI, Dec. 15.â Shortly after 8
o clock to-night the mercury reached
.zero here and is still falling. The Ohio
River suddenly fell from 10 to 15 feet dur
ing the day, causing much suffering along
the river front, through breaking up an
endless line of river boats. "Dock"
Orra, a well-known character on the
Kentucky side of the river, was found
frozen to death to-day near his home
at Fort Thomas.
AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 15.â The cold wave
has moderated. Cattle are not in good
condition for such weather, and in. their
unprotected condition : on the big ranges
it is feared that much loss will result. In
this section quite a number of horses
have died during the past twenty-four
hours, mostly the property of poor people
who have been unable to feed them prop
erly, on account of high prices of feed.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Dec. 15.â The
mercury reached a low mark this morn-
Ing when 10 degrees below zero was of
ficially recorded at the weather bureau.
From that hour it steadily, rose to 12 de
grees above and to-night stood _at 3
below.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Dec. 15.â From 16
degrees below zero in this city at an early
hour this morning the weather has grad
ually, moderated until, at 10 o'clock to
night, the mercury stands at 5 degrees
above zero. It is getting warmer through
out the State.

SINGLE WORD "APPROVED" TO END
SAMPSON-SCHLEY CONTROVERSY
Will Be Written by Secretary Long Below Findings
of the Full Court and No Action Will Be Taken
Regarding Admiral Dewey's Individual Opinion
Special Dispatch to the Call*
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
"W.. WASHINGTON. Dec. 15.â But the
single word "Approved," written below
the findings of the Schley court of In
quiry signed by Admiral Dewey as presi
dent, will probably, comprise the action
which will be taken thereon by Secretary
Long. Admiral Dewey's Individual ex
pression of opinion that Schley maintained
an effective blockade at Cienfuegos and
Santiago, proceeded with all dispatch
from Key West to Cienfuegos and from
Cienfuegos to Santiago and was in su
preme command In the battle with Cer-'
vera's fleet, will require no action, and
it is not believed that Secretary Long
will consider it part of his duty to either
approve or disapprove it. Aside from the
exceptions noted, Admiral Dewey has
agreed with his colleagues on the court
as to Rear Admiral Bchley's disobedience
of orders, failure tcA "pot" the Colon,
etc., so that it Is held by subordinate of
ficials of the Navy Department that It
is Secretary Long's duty to confine any
views he may express to the opinion ad
vanced by. the court and signed by the
admiral as president.
Congressional Action Unlikely.
Secretary Long does not propose to act
hastily, but he will certainly dispose of
the matter before the end of the week
and the court will then be dissolved. With
this action will conclude all investigation
of Rear Admiral Schley and of the con
duct of the navy during the war with
Spain. The mutterings of Rear Admiral
Sampson's friends over Admiral Dewey's
opinion will pass unheeded. Even the re
quest for a court of inquiry will not be
considered. The sense of Congress, de
veloped by consideration of the findings,
has established that both the Senate and
the House are opposed to a Congressional
investigation.
So, with Secretary Long's action, will
close officially the Schley-Sampson con
troversy. It was suggested to-day that,
notwithstanding the recommendations of
the court that there be no further pro
ceedings. Secretary Long will order a
courtmartial to try Rear Admiral Schley.
There is authority for the statement that
the Secretary has no thought of such ac
tion. In his opinion the morale of the ser
vice will be Immeasurably improved by
a close of the controversy, and he will
certainly consider this feature of the mat
ter in connection with the action he will
take. The department believes it could
order a courtmartial. notwithstanding the
expiration of the time- limit In the regu
lations, and thus compel Rear Admiral
Schley to plead the limitation at tho bar
of trial.
Squadron's Coal Supply Ample.
One of the features of the court's report
to which comparatively little attention
has been paid Is that relating to the coal
supply of the flying squadron. Lieutenant
Charles W. Dyson, an engineer officer,
prepared a table showing the length of
time the squadron could have blockaded
Santiago. Lieutenant Dyson gave the
Brooklyn 34.15 days: the Massachusetts.
26.23 days: the Iowa. 20.13 clays: the Texas,
16.54 days, and the Marblehead. 8.01 days.
The court found that the Brooklyn could
have remained on blockade duty for
twenty-six days, the Massachusetts for
twenty days, the Iowa for sixteen days,
the Texas for ten days and the Marble
head for five days, and would still have
had enough coal in their bunkers to have
steamed to Gonalve Bay, Haiti, or to
Cape Cruz. Cuba, to coal from the collier
Merrimac. The court's report shows that
Rear Admiral Schley had no reason to be
concerned over the coal Bupply ot hla
command. *
Raynor Hints .at Civil Action.
BALTIMORE, Md., Dec. 15.â Rear Ad
miral Schley has notified Attorney Gen
eral Baynor that he Is ready to taku any
action with reference to his case that
Raynor may advise. Raynor expects to
meet the admiral lrt Washington to-mor
row or Tuesday. When asked whether he
favored a Congressional investigation,
Raynor said:
"I doubt whether a proceeding of this
sort is the proper one. It generally as-<
sumes a political aspect. At this time I
am of the opinion that matters should
be prosecuted in the courts. Thero are
plenty of ways In which this can be done,
and this week we will begin to consult and
determine upon our course of action."
Among the telegrams Raynor ha3 re
ceived since the publication of the findings
of the court of inquiry was one from a
gentleman in another State, who E.sked
that his identity be kept secret, with an
offer of $10,000 for the necessary expenses
attending a further prosecution of thÂ«
case. The offer was declined.

ABNORMAL TRADE CONDITIONS.
THE condition of trade is abnormal for this time
of the year. Usually during the month of De
cember ihc wholesale business of the country
lulls off, being superseded by retail buying for the
holidays. But this year there is not only a lively re
tail trade all over the country, but undiminished
wholesale trading as well. This double activity is
seldom seen, and accentuates the current phenomenal
volume of general business. Almost every section of
the country and almost all lines of trade report the
same heavy movement in merchandise and produce.
The West and Southwest are large buyers of grain,
fruits and feedstufTs, owing to the partial failure of
the crops through last summer's long hot dry spell,
and the best of it is that they seem to have plenty of
money to buy with. The Atlantic and Middle States
report factories in full blast with large orders
running far into nexi year, and the Pacific Coast is
enjoj-ing cne of the best years id its history as far as
outward shipments of its field products go. There
seems hardly anything produced in California or its
two northern neighbors that is not in good demand,
cither for the East 'or foreign countries.
The general export trade of the country, hoxever.
seems to be slowly diminishing. Shipments of
breadstuff's, livestock, cotton and oils, while larger
than at this time last year, are smaller than during
October. For the calendar year to date, however,
shipments of these products are 5 per cent larger
than during any previous year. High prices, more
than any falling off in the demand, are causing the
current diminution iii foreign exports.
The failures are fewer than in 1900 at the moment,
those last week being 233 against 247 for the same
week last year.
The staples, considered individually, are lively and
in good condition for producers and sellers. Woolen
goods are in brisk demand, dress goods especially,
and raw wool continues to sell off well at all points.
Shipments of boots and shoes continue to exceed
those of last year and most of the factories are run
ning full time. Leather rules firm, but hides arc still
quoted easy. Cereals seem to have touched the crest
of the current rise and the tendency is toward lower
quotations again. Countrymen no longer crowd the
Board of Trade of Chicago scrambling for wheat,
while realizing in wheat, corn and oats has been enor
mous for a week. The decline in prices, however, is
unimportant and less than might have been expected.
The demand for iron and steel continues unabated
and commercial reports say that probably never be
fore was there so much forward business bqoked as
at present. If this industry were not hampered by a
chronic scarcity of cars its showing would surprise
the public; but many furnaces are being driven out

cars to move iron to and their product from the mill.
It would seem as if this dearth of rolling stock would
make a material decrease in the earnings of the rail
roads, but they actually show a gain of 11.5 in No
vember over the same month last year.
The feeling in Wall, street continues nervous and
unsettled. and the bankers and other conservative
financiers are warning the public to go slowly 'and
with caution. They say that we are in an era of ex
travagance, not economy; that the current activity in
trade is more in luxuries than in necessities; that we
are spending money when we should be saving if
tliat our exports are falling off and the foreign trade
balance is beginning to point against us; that scar
city and high prices of farm products <lo not mean
prosperity; that the present phenomenal wave of
commercial activity cannot last forever, and so on.
These bankers arc shrewd and careful men. They
generally know what they are talking about. They
say that there arc certain signs in the sky which only
the willfully blind will not sec and arc advising a
flower and more conservative pace. The advice is
gcod, even if we- arc doing a "land office" business.
Just about this time a good many society men have
come to the conclusion that the grand opera season
and the Christinas season have been brought a little
bit too clo^c together for gcod form.
FIGHTING THE ELEMENTS.
REPORTS from the orange-growing districts of
the State are to the effect that despite the se
verity of the frost there is reason to believe
the loss of fruit will be much less than might have
been feared. , The orchardists have resorted exten
sively to smudging and are sanguine the results will
show the efficacy of that system of fighting frost.
It is to be hoped the results will not only be bene
ficial but will be conclusive on the subject. A good
many orchardists are skeptical of the claims - made
for smudging as a piotection against frost. Some
have tried it without achieving success and have con
duded it is of little value. Others have argued that
the smudge smoke has no other effect than that of a
thin blanket which tends to prevent the radiation of
the heat of the earth during the night and also, to
prevent the ill effects of the morning sun streaming
directly through a clear sky upon the frosted fruit.
They argue, therefore, that it can be of no advantage
where the earth has been chilled by prolonged frost
or when there are winds that blow the smoke awayy
By reason of these differences of opinion it .has
been difficult in some parts of the State to get the
orchard pioprietors to engage in such universal
smudging as would cover the entire district with
smoke, and as a consequence in those districts the
experiment has never been given a full and fair trial."
If, now, after these repeated frosts and prolonged cold
weather, the orange orchards where smudging-has
been extensively resorted to are saved, there will be
something like a convincing demonstration of 'the
value of smudges. We may then expect that here :
after the practice will be more generally adopted and.
every fruit-growing district in the State will be com
paratively safe from danger of frost. .. 'â â ):
It is worth noting in this connection that the vine
growers of Austria and of France tontinue to assert
a confidence in the efficacy of cannonading hail
storms, despite the skepticism of scientific men. The
criticisms of the Chief of the Weather ,Bureau and
other authorities in this country have been tele
graphed to France, and in commenting upon them
Consul Covert, who represents the United States at
Lyons, says in a recent report to the State Depart
ment: "The individual opinion of any one is worth
iittle or nothing upon a question that is being tested
by experiments conducted on a large scale by sev
eral thousand people in two great nations. It is not
the uneducated peasantry, but the wealthy, well edu
cated proprietors, who have directed these experi
ments and who are most emphatic in indorsing
them. I have interviewed all classes of people, scien
tists and laymen, and find only one, Dr. Paul Caze
neuve, who does not accept the cannonading theory.
He insists that the experiments have not yet been
conducted under sufficiently diverse circumstances to
clearly prove the theory. In answer to this the large
proprietors and the peasants repose the most implicit
faith in cannon and laugh at the learned doubter.','
In matters of this kind it is always worth while to
make experiments wherever one has the means to af
ford the risk. Our science is still a long way from
understanding all the force's of nature. In the civil
ized world the soil has been fairly subdued and man
knows how to manage it. We have now to fight
weather. The battle, is difficult; but within certain
limits man may hope to achieve victory. The ten-"
deircy of the weather to produce frosts and hail
storms ti;ay eventually be counteracted by human
skill ns efficiently as the same skill can now counter
act the tendency of the soil to produce weeds and
generate diseases among trees arid vines.
Representative Robertson of Louisiana is a Demo
cratic member of the Ways and Means Committee,
arid yet when the Philippine tariff was under consid
eration in the committee Mr. Robertson voted with
the Republicans instead of the Democrats. Evidently
protection to home industries is appreciated in Lou
isiana when Louisiana happens to be the home of the
industry.
BILLS BEFORE CONGRESS.
DURING the first week of the session there
were introduced into the Senate 1104 bills
and into the House 4355. -That breaks the
record. During the first week of the last Congress
the bills introduced into the Senate amounted to 1050
and those in the House to 3300,^0 that the total of
both houses in the Fifty-sixth Congress was less than
the number introduced this time in the House alone.
The /bills range of course from measures upon
which the increasing welfare of the nation depends
to those designed to win favor in Buncombe. Pen
sion bills of one kind or another are more numerous
than any other class. Some of them arc for the pur
pose of providing a pension for a particular person
whose claim cannot be allowed under the general
laws, while others arc designed to so amend .the laws
as to increase* the list of persons eligible for pen
sions. An interesting bill intended to give govern
mental recognition lothe veterans of the Civil War
has been introduced by Senator Burrows. It pro
vides that the Government shall furnish each hon
orably discharged soldier, sailor or marine who
served ninety days in the Civil War with a badge or
button as a testimonial of his service for the preser
vation of the Union. It- also prescribes a penalty of
$500 fine and six months' imprisonment for falsely
wearing the badge. . .'
There are a considerable number of bills for es
tablishing national parks. Such measures have now
become one of the favorite means of getting appro
priations for districts which have no claim for river
or harbor improvements, or for Federal buildings.
Many of the parks are to be established upon sites
rendered historic by war and are to be of a memorial
nature. Pennsylvania has two bills of this kind, one
for a park at Valley Forge and the other at Brandy
wine. Kentucky wishes one at Perry ville 'and Geor
gia wishes one at Atlanta. The' most important of
this class of bills is that providing for a grand'na
tional park of upward .of 2,000,000 acres in the Ap
palachian Mountains. This park would be one of
national benefit, and will doubtless be established.
The fate of the others will depend largely upon the
skill with which their promoters can practice the art
of log-rolling. . . '
To this great mass of bills presented m the first
week of the session others will be added as the ses
sion goes on. It is utterly impossible for Congress
as a body to attend to them all. The mere reading
of them would take up about all the time the two
houses are in session. They will be sent to com
mittees and there the slaughtering will begin: Some
will go into pigeonholes, some into waste-baskets.
There will emerge from the committees, however, a
much larger number than the. House can attend to,
and the Committee on Rules will have to 'make a
further- diminution. :V^O-'-Y ; ''
Of- the despotic power of the Rules Committee
many complaints have been made, and yet it is clear
that such power must be lodged somewhere or Con
ftress would never be able to get along w j t h its work.
It is safe to say that many of the bills introduced are

not supported earnestly even by the men who pre
sented them. They 'are designed to please certain
elements of a Congressman's constituents and to en
able him to show that he is "domg something" at
Washington. The killing" of the great mass of- the
bills, therefore, is not going to hurt anybody.' Any
measure of genuine importance is sure to have a hear
ing sooner or later, and its chances are helped rather
than hurt by the authority given to the Committee
on Rules. In fact, the present system of dealing
with legislation has been developed'by the conditions
under which. legislation is carried on, and is not likely
to be changed until the conditions change.' '

â¢/*^\.UR London dispatches inform us that every
r%J body in Great- Britain who takes any interest
:^^' :,'"'â¢ P u b lic - affairs has been for a week waiting
impatiently jtp hear/what .Lord Rosebery will say in
his speech at Chesterfield to-day. The impatience is
,due to -.popular discontent with the present Govern
iment.fdisgust.with the incapacity of the Liberals and
thehope that Rosebery .will by .his speech reawaken
publicconfidence and prove himself to be fitted to
take chargej of the -affairs of the nation.
.Rarely have a great people been in such urgent
need- of a-leader the British people now. The
war .H South Africa, /which was expected to be "trou
blesome ; dut -not .dangerous," as General Buller said,
is; now ; more troublesome than ever, and/moreover,
has "become' decidedly dangerous. .Winston Churchill
very graphically: .described it by saying that at first
"if was like an open wound where the blood flowed
freely/but now it has become a festering wound and
threatens to poison- the empire." The manner in
which it has been waged has possibly been not more
severe than is necessary in dealing with guerrillas,
but it has had the effect of exciting against Great
Britain a large number. of persons in all parts of the.
civilized world. That popular hostility is not to be
ignored. It constitutes a very serious menace to
British interests and. may weaken alliances where'
Britain needs them most.
In addition to the gloomy outlook abroad, the do
mestic situation is anything but reassuring. The pub
lic debt is rapidly augmenting, taxes are heavier than
ever, and, moreover, a formidable competition with
British industries is appearing in the home market
itseM. The Ministry seems utterly incompetent to'
deal with the situation. Salisbury is old. and has be
come something like a pessimist, having no word of
cheer other than that of the utterance of a dogged
determination to see the war through. Chamberlain
has been found incompetent. His speeches have the
misfortune to make enemies for Great Britain instead
of making friends. No one else in the Ministry .has
any strength at all. The Liberals are equally deficient
in leadership. It is. therefore, Rosebery or nothing;
The man from whom the empire is expecting so
much and whose words to-day are waited for with
such anxiety is one of those children of fortune who
seem to have been born with. every good gift except
that of making a great use of it. His tutor at Eton
described him as a man- who, could easily win the
laurels if he would, but who would shrink from the
struggle, and the dust of the arena. Were he ani
mated by any of Roosevelt's delight in the "strenuous
life" (jie would be a leader indeed. It happens, how
ever, that he has none of it. He has more than once
expressed his dislike of government by party. He has
recently declared he would like to see the affairs
of Great Britain managed by business men like Car
negie and Lipton. Some time ago he announced that
he would ally himself with no party, but would "plow
his own furrow and stay in it." Now it is to be seen
what he has to offer in the way of leadership to the
nation.
The dispatches state that the desire to hear him is
so grea^that the hotels of Chesterfield began to fill
up with strangers last week, notwithstanding it was
announced that every seat in the hall where, the
speech is to be made had been already taken. Prob
ably it is the intention to give him a grand ovation
on the streets should he speak "like one having
authority." All things being taken into considera
tion, Rosebery has before him the, greatest opportu
nity that has been enjoyed by an orator in this gener
ation. If he be equal to the occasion he may be
Prime Minister of Great Britain before the coming
year closes. If lie fail, his political career will end in a
worse fiasco than that of Bryan.
THE SOUTH AND THE TARIFF.
BY- the report of the Democratic minority of the
.Ways and Means Committee of the House on
the Philippine bill it appears the opposi
tion is to attack the Administration on 1 general prin
ciples and not upon specific policies." There. was a
time when Democrats would have objected to the
proposed tariff because it would interfere with free
dom of trade. That they now evade that issue as far
as possible is an evidence they have learned some
thing. In fact, a Louisiana member of the commit
tee, who is as much a Democrat as any other in Con
gress, is in favor of imposing tariff duties upon im
ports from the Philippines. He is not going to sac
rifice the agricultural interests of his State for the
sake of making a Democratic platform.
There are other Democratic States as well as Lou
isiana that would be injuriously affected by the coni
petition of cheap labor were full freedom of trade
granted to the Philippines. It is for that reason,
more than any other, perhaps, that; the minority of
the Ways and Means Committee "denounce the so
called "imperial policy" as a whole instead of making
a straight fight for the free admission of Philippine
products. The demand of the minority is that the
Filipinos be fitted for self government and indepen
dence, and about all their report has to say of the
proposed tariff is: "We do not believe the trade we
are now obtaining or that we are likely to obtain
under our operations in the Philippines is worth what
we are paying for it." .
The delicate way in \\hich the Democrats have han
dled this issue may be significant of .what. would hap
pen should; the Northern wing of the Democratic
party take up the free trade issue again. It seems
clear they could no longer rely upon the support of
the solid South. , % A free trade campaign 'might split
the party in that" section as deeply as free silver split
it in the North. At the Massachusetts banquet, the
other day Henry Watterson said Kentucky niight yet
be a champion , of protection When Pennsylvania is
for free trade, and the saying is not without reason.
The South is no longer unanimous for free trade or
for anything that tends to it

QUEER GUIANA REPTILE
IS SENTINEL LIZARD
CURIOUS REPTILE OF GUIANA, KNOWN AS THE SENTINEL LIZ
ARD. IS GIVEN ITS NAME BECAUSE IT HISSES LOUDLY WHEN
EVER IT DISCOVERS A RATTLESNAKE OR A CROCODILE.
ONE of the most curious reptiles In the world is the so-called sentinel liz
ard of Guiana, this name being given to it because It hisses loudly when
ever it discovers a rattlesnake or a crocodile. The authorities of the
. Museumof Natural History In. Paris were extremely delighted when they
received word some time ago that M. Merwaert. a leading official in
French Guiana, was sending them a fine specimen. - and were correspondingly
disappointed on opening the box to find the lizard dead.
This lizard was more than four feet in length. If It had reached the mu
seum alive it is thought likely that it would have survived for several years,
as it could easily have been supplied with appropriate food, such as eggs, chop
ped meat and young birds.
The natives of Guiana say that the flesh of the sentinel lizard is very savory,
and the few Europeans who have tasted it agree with them. Their eggs, which
are, oval in shape and quite large, are also regarded as a great delicacy.
The scientific name of this lizard is "Tupinamble nigropunctatus," and "Teju
guacua," or simply "Teju," is the native name for It.

THE SHIP EDWARD EVERETTâ M.
H., Santa Cruz. Cal. J. W. Davis of Sac
ramento has kindly furnished the depart
ment of Answers to Correspondents the
following account of the pioneer ship Ed
ward Everett:
â¢ Tho Edward Everett sailed from Boston Jan
uary 12. 1S19, with 1 112 passengers, and arrived
at San Francisco, via Cape Horn. Friday, July
6, 1949. Among the passengers was Rev. J.
A.Benton, a pioneer CongreKatlonallst minis
ter, and for many years pastor of the church
of that denomination in Sacramento. In an
anniversary sermon delivered July 12, 1SH,
speaking of the voyage of the Everett. Mr.
Benton said: "We left the harbor of Boston
early the morning of the 12th of January, 1843,
a brlsht. clear, winter day. the thermometer
having fallen below zero the preceding night.'
The voyage was not a swift one nor were its
incidents striking. We fell in with very few
vessels on the ocean. We did not see land ex
cept during our passage through the Straits. of
>Le Malre. . We made only one port on the way,'
that of Valparaiso, early in May. We were
there about a week. The Gold-hunter's Log.
a weekly, was published on board of the ship.
The most tedious part of the voyage was from
Valparaiso up. because It was protracted by
calms and head winds and because our anxiety
to have it end speedily added to our sense of
tedium. When our . anchor dropped in San
Francisco Bay we had been six months on the
way. lacking one week. During .the days we
remained at the bay our home was still on
the ship, and In her we ran up as far as Ben;
cla on the lOth'of July, sailing. slowly enough
to enjoy all the. beauty of the fine scenery, the
islands, the rocks, the blue water, tha San
Pablo expanse. | the Carqulnez | opening, tho
lifting un of the hills, the towering head of
Mount Diablo. We were two days in Benlcla.
The . ship was to remain - there. We left her
on the morning of the 12th and few of us have
ever seen her since. â  though the imsression Is
that she is BtiH afloat somewhere."
The last record that there Is of the ves
sel in San Francisco Is furnished by A. J.
Coolidge. formerly secretary of the Mer
chants' Exchange, which Is that she
sailed from t this port for Callao April 12,
1850. Wlllard B. Farwell, who was. one
of the passengers on the vessel In '49, one
of the few still living, has no informa

GRIEVANCES
OF WARRANT
MACHINISTS
Engineer-in-Chfef George W. Melvillo
has somewhat modified his views ex
pressed two years ago In relation to tha
warrant machinist corps established in
1S0D to take the place of the commissioned
engineer officers in the engine-room,
which had been transferred, to the Una
corps.' Chief Melville then said: "With
the official elevation which comes with
a warrant there is not unreasonable ap
prehension that these m'?n will desire a
severance from actual manual care of
the machinery of our ships, and will ex
pect to act merely as engineering super
visors below. This, of course, would Le
wholly inconsistent with the Interests of
the service. â¢ * â¢ Clear and definite
regulations are needed tn this point at
the start, in order that no ambiguity may
foster discontent with simple duty. or lead
to hopes of further offlci&l elevation." On
October 1 last he complains that warrant
machinists are discriminated against, and
that their advancement, open to ,cM*nov
warrant officers, should be equallS\ as
great. As two gunners ha.ve recently been
promoted to ensigns. Chief Melville'a
recommendation Is not rJone proper and
fair but indicates a decided change oÂ£
opinion in two years.
There were four prominent naval archi*
tects mentioned as possible successors to
the post of Director of Naval Construc
tion in the British admiralty, from, whidx
Sir "William H. White tas resigned, anj
to which Philip Watts has succeeded.
There was Chief Constructor H. E. Dead
man of the navy, at present time senior
chief constructor In the admiralty, receiv
ing a salary of $3750; another was J. W.
Shepherd of the London and Glasgow 1
Shipbuilding Company on the Clyde; Pro
fessor J. H. Biles of the Glasgow Univer
sity, an eminent naval expert, was also)
said to be a candidate, while Philip Watts,
formerly a constructor In the navy anil
now holding a -similar pcsitlon In the Els
wick Company, was not so desirous oÂ£
succeeding Sir William. The regular sal
ary of the Director of Naval Construc
tion was $7500 a year, but in 1SS3, when
Nathaniel Barnaby retired and William
White, then at Elswlck, was selected to

J. R. Freud Addresses a
Large Audience on
Merit System. â¢
â h
Declares the City Must Own
and Control All Pub
lic Utilities.
"Municipal Civil Service'.! was the sub
ject of an address delivered before a large
audience last Â«ventnÂ« at the Metropolitan
Temple by J. Ricr..â d FreTvJ. The speak
er in upholding tb , nerit ;. t tem declared
k: to be as demo atic aifU American in
desire and sent: .lent as^r the common
school system of ducatioriÂ£yet there was
a false sentiment existing^ in some who
attributed to the civil service system
something that was aristocratic. There
could be no greater fallacy, and as an in
stance the speaker illustrated the intelli
gence and high capacity of letter carriers,
all of whom showed and proved their
capability to obtain and hold their re
sponsible offices. In the merit system
mere was nothing that was complex, or
mysterious or intricate.
Business men practiced It every day,
the speaker said, when they demanded to
know the fitness of those who sought em
ployment. They did not inquire into a
man s political opinions, but they de
manded that he must be able to discharge
his duties efficiently. There was nbthing
of a partisan character in the merit sys
tem. Politics was formidably against civil
service, he declared, and would crush it,
but the people were strenuously in its
favor. 1o Andrew Jackson and Van Bu
ren he a.tributed the spoils system and
since Jackson, Presidents, one after the
other, hand condemned and deplored ap
pointments other than by merit.
There was no place on earth where the
people held the destinies of a city in their
hands as didihe citizens of San Francisco,
Mr.. Freud declared. It was necessary
for them to uphold and further the merit
system, which would assure them honesty
and efficiency in office. Of late years
things had changed somewhat and the
political bosses had not the power they
had in the past, yet California was slow
to see its way clear on the subject. It
was a "spoils State" given over to "spoils
â politics."
The lecturer cited as Instances of his
charges the administration of the harbor,
the hospitals and the prisons and remind
ed his hearers that a doctor who had
served the State for twenty years had
been turned out of office in the twinkling
of an eye through politics. He hoped that
California would soon have a State civil
service law as has New Tork, Illinois and
Massachusetts.
The speaker illustrated the advance
ment of cities in England. France, Ger
many and Austria, where municipalities
owned and operated public utilities and
declared that the people of this city had
voted for a similar municipal control.

JEFFERSON'S SON
IS INSUFFICIENT
Pails to Reach Father's
Standard as Rip
Van Winkle.
Theaters Are Preparing to
Present Their Holiday
Attractions.
Not even the name of a Jefferson in
connection with "Rip Van Winkle"
served to attract the multitudes to the
California Theater last night, nor to be
dazzle the slim audience that did make
its appearance^ It was not the great
man himself, but Thomas Jefferson, his
son that pictured the- immortal "Rip,"'
and that was perhaps what was the mat
ter with the audience, as well as with Mr.
Jefferson himself. He is the son of a
great man and is trying to fill a pair of
very large shoes witn a No. 6 foot.
The day of the play has perhaps gone
as a medium for cramming houses, and
even the ushers had the soft pedal on
last nignt so far as applause was con
cerned, yet in "Rip" mere is one of the
shrewdest and most picturesque charac
ter studies ever conceived, the opportuni
ty of a lifetime for a player like Joe
Jefferson. It is not his son's big chance,
evidently, though the part is played
agreeably by fcir. Jetierson. But it 13 a
negative sort *of conception, pitched in
too low key and lacking in body and
roundness. It is not sufficiently genial,
not sufficiently tragic, not sufficiently
anvthing, and though it is nothing that it
should not be, Mr. Jefferson's Rip is by
no means all that it should be. He has
a modicum of all the necessary qualities,
the dry, shrewd humor, the jovial irre
sponsibility, the persuasive lovableness,
the easy weakness of the village vaga
bond, but not enough of anv one of them.
His work in the later scenes is his best
and as the returned Rip, a broken old
man, he comes out rather strongly.
The company supporting Mr. Jefferson
is one of the dustiest. Gretchen is cari
catured out of all recoggnition by Mar
garet Hayward, and the rest of the char
acters fare equally hard at the hands
ci the rest of the company. Eugene
Brown as Meenle is a bright spot, how
ever.
At the Columbia Theater Jefferson de
Angel's will continue for a week more
in the operatic success "A Royal Rogue."
De Angelis is a very amusing comic
opera star and as he is surrounded by a
lot of capable people the performance Is
one of strong interests. It will be given
for the last time on Sunday night.
Interest is already being shown in the
engagement of Mary Mannering in
"Janice Meredith"- at the Columbia The
ater. The opening performance will take
place next Monday night, and from pres
ent appearances the audience will be a
large and fashionable one. Miss Man
nering is one of our most beautiful and
talented stars and her play has proven
eminently successful. The production
shown during the run of the piece at
Wallack's Theater, New York, will be
brought here.
To-night the Tivoli Comic Opera, Com
pany will return to the popular opera
house and will present Ferris Hartman's
new Christmas extravaganza, "Little Red
Riding Hood." The fantasy is in Hart
man's best style, breezy, up-to-date and
full of good things. He has a part as
King Fire Fly that should fit all his
peculiarities v-ithout a wrinkle, and has
provided the rest of the company with
roles that show them at their best. Miss

SOME NOTABLE SOCIAL AFFAIRS
TO OCCUR DURING PRESENT WEEK
I NEVER met another debutante â¢who
has such a thoroughly good time
as Miss Kathryn Robinson. She is
at the very top notch of happiness
every time you see her. It is a
standing joke among ' her girl
friends that she, has invariably just
had "the time of her life." She is asked
everywhere. Never was a debutante more
sought after, and it is not to be wondered
at, for she is quite unconscious of her
beauty, but ever bubbling over with de
light, and her frank, childlike enthusiasm
is truly refreshing.
Miss Robinson will give what she
chooses to call "a little informal after
noon" next Sunday for the debutantes,
and it is needles to say she has no idea
'of leaving out the men.

It will be a long time before San Fran
cisco will have such another tea as the
one given by Mrs. Towne and Mrs. Wor
den last Saturday afternoon. Everything
was perfectly appointed and showed every
thoughtful consideration of the guests,
who in return paid their hostesses th-j
compliment of looking their very best.
When has there been such a display of
jewels and laces at a tea before?
The gowns, too, were superb. " Mrs.
Towne, with her usual modesty, wore an
all-black gown of spangltd tulle, a sim
ple mauve velvet flower in her hair being
the only touch of color. Several hand
some diamond ornaments completed tho
toilet.
Mrs. Worden's gown was well chosen.
It was of soft cream wool with exquisite
Valenciennes lace and insertion. Her col
lar was solely of jewels â one row of large
diamonds, two strings of pearls and a
small gold chain studded with d.amonds.
One of the most ethereal gowns was the
pale blue chiffon creation worn by Mrs.
Fletcher F. Ryer, who assisted in receiv
ing. There were clouds of lilmy gauze
that would almost have blown away but
for the wealth of duchesse lace. There
was a wide lace flounce at the 'feet, and
the bodice was also elaborately trimmed.
Mrs. Henry J. CrocKer wore a stylish
gown of white brocaded satin and that
wonderful necklace of hers. It is a wide
collarâ a trellis work of diamonds with
a tiny diamond rosette at the corner of
each square, and a pearl in the center o'f
each, giving the effect of three strings
of pearls and a number of rows of dia
monds^ A new boa she wore was very
much/ admired. It was a full, fluffy af
fair made of scores of white silk poppy
petals, all fastened loosely together.
I wonder if Mrs. E. R. Diamond knew
how stunning she looked in that^elegant
black satin cloak which she has just
brought from New york? It was long,
with white revers all the way down the
front. The broad collar and revers were
of rich Irish point lace over white satin.
The bell sleeves turned back and showed
the same white facings. The cloak fas
tened with four black velvet rosettes with
rhlnestone buttons in the centers.

CARS BATTERED
IN A COLLISION
Passengers Fortunately
Escape Any Serious
Injuries.
Accident Occura on Corner
of Sutter and Devisa
dero Streets.
Either through a faulty brake or greasy
track or neglect. on the part of a motor
man to observe the rule of right-of-way,
a collision occurred yesterday morning
about 10:30 at the corner of Devisadero
and Sutter streets between a Devisadero
street car bound north and a Sutter-street
car going east.
Each car carried a good number of pas
sengers and when the crash came and
the dummy was thrown from the tracks
it was feared that some had been injured.
That they escaped with nothing more
than a severe shaking and shock was
fortunate, for the front of each car
shows the force of the collision.
Among the passengers was M. Cohen
of 1516 Devisadero street, who testifies
to the narrow escape of the occupants of
the cars from serious injuries. . An elderly
lady, seeing a collision was inevitable,
attempted to leap from the northbound
car, but was forcibly held back by Cohen.
The officials of the Sutter-street line
claim right-of-way and cannot under
stand how it was that the cars came into
collision.
Defective Flue Causes Fire.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 15.â A fire caused by a
defective nue broke out in the McAnney
residence, 2848 Central avenue, this after

The new bill which opens at the

Alma Wutrich, juvenile comedienne; Al
Hazzard, ventriloquist; Montgomery and

J. Sherrie Matthews and Nonna Whal
ley continue as the main attraction this
week at the Orpheum. All of the addi

and the Dumond Parisian Minstrels, play
ing their final week, still keep the audi
ences convulsed.
Mr. and Mrs. Gardner Crane appear in
a dainty comedietta entitled "A Happy

and their acting thoroughly finished. "A
Happy Pair" was cordially received, and
is one of the best skits of its sort seen

CLAIMS HIS ARREST IS

A man who gave his name as II. M.

SPORTS OF THE DIAMOND, COURSING FIELD, GRIDIRON AND TENNIS COURTS
HONORS ARE WON
BY COLD SHIVERS
Fast Greyhound Annexes
Union Park Open
Stake.
Lively Pace of Strong Hares
Gives Coursers Hard
Running.
Storl & Knowles' fast young greyhound
Cold Shivers, winner of the last Cali
fornia Futurity, captured first honors in
the open stake yesterday at Union Cours
ing Park. Too much credit cannot be
given the game youngster for his last
victory, when his fast company in the
class event is considered.
The hares furnished for the stake were
a fast lot. even livelier than those of the
preceding day. From the opening course
they set a heart breaking pace for their
pursuers and as the stake progressed
teemed to show increasing speed.
In the first round Cold Shivers was
slipped with Hickory Dick, his opponent
in the Futurity iinal. The pair were sent
after a jack that was more than their
equal in speed and were still In pursuit
â¢when the time limit was up. Relief dogs
joined in and at the end of the course
coiu Shivers was given the decision. The
hard work told plainly on the victor and
no one looked for him to respond for the
next round. The game youngster recov
ered sufficiently, nowever, to outpoint
fclim in his next go and foilowed by Deal
ing Freda C in a close course.
After a bye in the fourth round Cold
Shivers beat Sacramento Boy pointless
in the semi-rinal and earned tfie rigrht to
contest lor the last flag. Faraway, who
had been fortunate in getting short
courses had reached the bottom, of the
card and the talent made him a 5 to 3
lavorite over the harder run Cold
fcmvers. Faraway showed the speed,
boored the first five points and stumbled,
cola Shivers got in and by his game
and determined efforts landed the stake
after a severe course.
Sacramento Boy looked the best dog
in the stake for a time, but fell a victim
to coursing luck. In every trial the
clever dog was forced to a long run until
In the fourth round. In a bye with Can
delaria, a 1 to '2 favorite, he won a course
that virtually proved his undoing.
Palo Alto, the stake favorite, was with
drawn after the second round, he, too,
being overworked by the fast hares.
Slipper "Jim" Grace scored a hit by
clever work in ending courses when
the contestants and relief dogs were out
footed by the hares. On four occasions
after the hounds had been run to a
standstill the athletic young slipper
picked up the hare as it passed his sta
tion and throwing it over the fence
stopped a killing course.

SENATORS LOSE
A CLOSE GAME
>
Meet Defeat in an Inter
esting Game With
All-Americas.
Circus Catches by Sheehan
and Barrett Enliven
the Contest.
The All-America baseball stars added
two more to their string- of victories yes
terday, shutting out the Oakland team
in the morning and defeating the Sena
tors by a 3-2 score at Recreation Park in
the afternoon.
v "Rube" Waddell struck out eleven men
and fielded his position well until the last
inning, when he intercepted a ball intend
ed to shut off a runner at second. The
ball hit the big pitcher's glove and bound
ed out of reach, Devereaux scoring and
McLaughlin going to second. Before the
score could be tied, however, Stricklett
flew out, ending the game.
Leaving aside the errors, and each team
made glaring ones, the game was an in
teresting one. Two sensational catches
were made. In the second inning Dever
eaux sent a fly out into right field. Bar
rett, who is stationed at center, but plays
all over the field, started for the ball as
it was hit. He ran around the fence
which projects into center field and after
a long .run captured the ball. r x"he spec
tators thought it an impossible play and
so did Eagan, who ran on the hit and was
thrown out at first before he could re
turn.
The other circus catch was made by
Sheehan. L-ajoie hit a fly over thira.
Sheehan ran to the fence, reached for the
ball in among the spectators and cap
tured it. Devereaux nearly had a lit
when he saw his team mate return with
the ball.
The Easterners sent a man home in the
first inning. It was Barrett, who, next
to Waddell, has made the greatest hit
here. He hit to shortstop and was safe
and scored on Mercer's two-bagger to left
tield. JL^ijoie singled, the ball hitting Mer
cer, who was sprinting for third. Mercer
was disgusted, as, besides being retired
when he had a possible chance to score,
he was hurt by the ball. Davis singled
and stole second while the ball was in
the infield. Bradley flew, retiring the side.
The Eastern men did not score again
uutil the sixth, although they had a man
on second in each inning. In the sixth
Bradley hit to Eagan at second. He threw
wide to first, Bradley being safe at sec
ond. Irwin sacrificed and Sullivan flew
to left field. Bradley just beat the ball
home on the throw in.
In the eighth Irwin scored. He started
with a two-bagger. Waddell hit a fly to
right field and the pitcher, flelder and
first baseman all went after it. They were
all under the ball, but each left it lor the
other. The ball hit the ground and Irwin
scored.
The Senators scored their first, run in
the seventh. From the way they started
proceedings it seemed they would be scor
ing yet. Waddell redeemed himself by
striking out two men and the third man
was out on a hit to first. Courtney, the
first man up. was safe on Irwln's fum
ble. Davis was also safe on Irwin's fum
ble. Eagan bunted to Waddell, who threw
badly to first base. This filled the sacks,
with nobody out. Devereaux took four
balls, forcing Courtney home.
.The spectators became enthused for the
first time, as it looked rosy for a num
ber of runs, Waddell then struck out
McLaughlin and Stricklett, and McNeely
was out at first, leaving three discon
solate players ornamenting the bases.
In the last inning, with two men gone,
Devereaux singled to third. McLaughlin
sent a fly to Lajoie, who misjudged its
flight and missed it. Devereaux stole
third. McLaughlin stole second and the
catcher shot the ball down to stop him.
Waddell intercepted It, but failed to hold
it. Devereaux scored on the play and
McLaughlin was safe. McNeely flew out,
ending the game. The score:

FORTUNE IN GOLD MINE
Puts One Hundred Thousand Dol-
lars Into Colorado Mining
Property.
DENVER. Colo., Dec. 15.â James Jef
fries, champion heavyweight of the world,
has invested more than $100,000 in mining
property near Ward and probably will

the winter to look after his interests.
He is Interested with James Craig, a for
mer mining man of British Columbia,
who induced the champion to invest after
his fight with Ruhlin.
Jeffries previously followed the counsel
of Craig by investing in some mining
property in Canada, which is now paying
the champion a good income, and since
that time the two have been close friends.
Jeffries has practically turned over all
his interests to Crate's care.

The snappy, crisp air was the delight of
pedestrians and -horsemen, who were out
in large numbers. ". ;^
He was carried to the side line, and it
was fully twelve minutes before he re
gained consciousness. The loss of the
fullback seemed to completely demoral
ize the navy-yard boys. The defense,
which in the first half had not been of
the best, completely faded away before
the persistent line bucking and end run
ning of the Princeton backs. During the
last half the Princetons scored twice,
and each time a goal was kicked. "When
the whistle was finally sounded the local
men had the ball on their opponents' five

"CASEY" A COMPANION
OF ABSCOMDER FLEISHMAN
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 15.â David "W.
Shanks of Los Angeles, who saw and
talked with H. J. Fleishman, the ab
sconding bank cashier, in Mexico, reached
here to-day. Mr. Shanks repeated the
details of his meeting with Fleishman at
Torreon, Mexico, last Tuesday. After re
lating the incident of his conversation.
Shanks continued to say:
"As I started for my train he turned
to a fellow he called Casey, with whom
he seemed on very good terms, and the
last I saw of him he and Casey were
Standing talking together. He did not in
troduce us, and I took no particular no
tice of the man. 1 *eishman did not show
the slightest embarrassment all the time
I was talking with him. His personal ap
pearance seemed somewhat neglected. He
looked as though he had not shaved for
five or eix days. He made no attempt
to disgTiise ' himself. Yet after this sec
ond recuest to keep still about seeing
him I suspected that â¢ something was
wrong;' The first thing I did when the
train reached El Paso Thursday morning
was to buy a paper. Then I found that
my suspicions. were verified." . .
There is no clew in L<>r Angeles to the
identity of the man Casey with Fleish
man.

WITH SOLEMN CEREMONY AND THE BLESSING OF ARCHBISHOP
RIORDAN CORNERSTONE OF SACRED HEART CHURCH IS LAID
New Edifice Is Consecrated
to Inviolable Mission by
Prelate and Many Priests
Father Lagan Preaches Upon
Pastor's Energy and Great
â¢â¢Beauty of Holy Tabernacle
OAKLAND, Dec. 15.â The corner
stone of the new Sacred Heart
Church, at the corner of Fortieth
and Grove streets, was laid this
afternoon with fitting ceremony
in the presence of several thousand peo
ple. Archbishop P. W. RIordan of San
Francisco conducted the services and con
secrated the edifice to its sacred mission.
There were many priests, both from Oak
land and San Francisco, in attendance,
and all the local Catholic societies were
present in full force.
Prior to holding the cornerstone cere
monies all the participants assembled at
St. Frances de Sales Church, where a short
service was held. Here the organized
bodies met in marching array and after
tbe service lined up in processional forma
tion for the long tramp to Fortieth street.
It was a big procession and a long road,
but the lively music contributed by the
band of the Societa de Christofero Colum
bo made marching easy, and distance was
covered without tiring anybody.
The consecration services were held on
the finished floor of the new building,
where a â¢ temporary platform . and altar
had been erected.
The services were held at the west end
of the building. It was at the southeast
corner that the stone was laid, and so
great was the crowd on the floor that it
seemed as if two distinct ceremonies were
being held.
Promptly at' 3 o'clock 5 Archbishop Rior
dan, accompanied, by Fathers Fraught,
Heslin and Mulligan, made his way
through the throng\to where the mass of
hewn sandstone was swinging over its
permanent resting place. "
Priests in Full Robes.
The priests were clad in their full robes
of office, and the white and gold of the
vestments shone bright and clear against
the dull background presented by the
mass of humanity from which the priestly
procession had emerged.
Archbishop Riordan, with solemn cere
monial, blessed the stone. Father Mulli
gan acted as master of ceremonies.
Father Praught as deacon and Father
Heslin sub-deacon.
In a cavity in the foundation was placed
a copper box containing a programme of
the exercises, the names of the societies
participating and the names of the offi
cers of the new church.
Over this foundation the stone was then
carefully lowered. Again the Archbishop
spoke words of consecration and with a
sprinkling of holy water closed the cere
mony. With the benediction the exer
cises were concluded.
Meanwhile services were being conduct
ed at the west end of the floor. The choir
of Sacred Heart Church discoursed sacred
music and later, when the Archbishop and
party had retired. Father Lagan of San
Francisco preached a sermon.
"Oakland," paid Father Lagan, "is re
nowned throughout the country as 'the
city of churches.' It comes rightly by its
fame, but I â want to tell you people of
Sacred Heart parish that when this edi
fice is completed there will be nothing
more beautiful in the whole of Alameda
FITZ AND SAILOR
IN LIVELY BOUT
Former Champion Spars
Five Rounds With
Sharkey.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
NEW YORK, Dec. 15.â Robert Fitzsim
mons, former heavy-weight champion
pugilist, and Tom Sharkey, an aspirant
for that title, met in a fifteen-foot ring
early this morning and boxed five rounds
for points. It was their first meeting in
the ring since "Lanky Bob" put the sailor
out in the second round before the Coney
Island Athletic Club a year and a half
ago The bout was held at the Theatrical
Business Men's Club, at 139 West Forty
first street. The club held a smoker for
members only and the tip went forth that
it would be worth while attending. Both
fighters were stripped, with the exception
of their trunks, and they donned eight
ounce gloves. It was announced that the
bout was to be a friendly one and simply
for points.
In the first four rounds honors were
easy. In the fifth round the men agreed
to mix it up and they started right at it.
Fitzsimmons led with his right for the
body and landed good and stiff. He fol
lowed this up with a right hand hook
that landed on Sharkey's jaw. Sharkey
swung his right for Fitzsimmons head
and left a red spot on the lanky fighter s
cheek to show for It. They fought at close
auarters and there was an even exchange
of blows. Both men were puffing before
the round was half over.
As the men warmed up to their work
the spectators gave vent to their delight
in cheers. Sharkey got in a couple of
body blows and Fitzsimmons returned
them by landing on the sailor's massive
h From this on till the bout ended they
went at each other hotly. Blows were
coming so quickly when the gong sounded
that they could not be counted. When
the bout was over the men shook hands.
The referee declared the bout a draw.

"I am grlad to be here to-day," he con
tinued, "if only to see the crown of glory
placed on the work done here by Father
Serda, the honored pastor of this parfsh..
When he was placed in charge twenty
five years ago the outlook was anything
but inspiring. There was no church, no
pastoral residence, no school accommoda

was scarce and widely scattered.
Sacrifice of the Pastor.
"Father Serda went to work, however,
gathered together his little flock and by
the sweat of his browâ I say this literally
âbuilt up this parish to what it is to-day.
It has meant hard work and' self sacri

courage sorely when by means of fire he
swept away in a brief hour the result
of your years of toil.
PLAN TO REDUCE
THE WAR TAXES
Ways and Means Com
mittee Informally Dis
cusses Matter.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.-Chairman
Payne of the Ways and Means Commit
tee says that no definite plans have been
made thus far for considering the ques
tion of further reducing the war taxes.
At the same time there has been much
informal discussion of the subject, much
data has been gathered concerning- the
items which can be best reduced, and
there seems to be a general purpose on
the part of the members of the commit
tee to push the important question to
the front soon after the holidays. In
speaking of the matter to-day, Payne
said:
With a surplus of about $100,000,000 I have
no doubt the Ways and Means Committee will
frame a bill reducing the revenues, probably
on the general lines of the last war tax reduc
tion bill. But there is no particular hurry in
dealing with the subject, as there are several
contingencies which may call for a large in
crease in Government expenditures, and It will
be well to understand pretty well what our
expenditures are to be before finally determin
ing on a large reduction of the revenues.
When we make the reduction we ought to
make It as large as can be made with safety
In my judgment the committee will take the
matter up soon after the holidays. Whether
we will have hearings or not will depend upon
the pleasure of the committee.
In the absence of action by the committee,
Payne will not discuss the prospects of re
duction on particular items. Already how
ever, several interests have applied for hear
ings. These include the representatives of the
tea Interests, who desire to have the 10 cent
tax Imposed by the war revenue act taken on*
that product. No formal application has been
made by the representatives of the beer and
wine interests, but both are expected to make
strong efforts for reductions In their respective
taxes. Suggestions have also reached) mem
bers of the committee that the war tax im
posed on banking capital be taken off. An
other proposition for the doing away of the
withdrawal stamp taxes on imported merchan
dise, particularly on tobacco, as these with
drawal stamps are said to be very onerous to
importers. The large tobacco Interests have
not yet made known what further reduction
they would seek on tobacco, but the independ
ent producers of manufactured tobacco and
snuff are understood to desire a reduction from
the present rate of six cents per pound. Bills
have been introduced proposing a 'reduction as
low as two cents per pound. There is no sug
gestion thus far that further changes will be
made on sugar? and cigarettes. Owing to the
large amount of surplus there is some senti
ment among the members In favor of wiping
out the entire list of war revenue taxes at a
single stroke, thus leaving the revenues and
customs law upon the basis that existed prior
to the Spanish war. \

BITTER GROWS
THE OHIO FEUD
A Compromise Between
Foraker and Hanna
Not Probable.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
CINCINNATI, O., Dec. 15.â Much in
terest is taken in the expected trip of
George B. Cox and other Republican
leaders to Washington this week. Owing
to the contest between the friends of
Senator Foraker and Senator Hanna over
the organization of the Legislature there
is an unusual agitation all over the
State. The long distance telephone has
been in use daily between Washington
and Ohio cities, and especially with cer
tain Republicans at Columbus and Cin
cinnati, and now it is reported that there
may be another attempt at compromise
by a conference in Washington betore the
Kepublican caucuses are held at Colum
bus two weeks from next Saturday. If
no compromise be effected, it is said, both
Senators Foraker and Hanna may come
to Columbus after Congress adjourns for
the holidays, to marshal their respective
forces for the caucus contest.
During the campaign of the past sum
mer the Ohio Senators co-operated in the
interests of the Republican candidates
for the Legislature, as Senator Foraker's
successor is to be elected now (January,
14) and Senator Hanna' s successor two
years hence. The Junior Ohio Senator
was interested as well as the senior
Ohio Senator, because it so happened
tnat about 8 per cent of the members
elect are on their first terms_ tm& are
expected to be serving their second terms
when the election of Senator Hanna' s
successor takes place in the next Legis
lature. . -
The Hanna men assert that the Poraker
men proceeded after the election to form
slates for the organization of both
branches of the Legislature with ulterior
views, notably that of the retirement of
Hanna two years hence. The contest
about two weeks ago broke out into open
conflict and now there are opposing tick
ets, composed of Foraker and Hanna
men, respectively, ' for the caucuses of
both the Republican State Senators . and
the Republican Representatives. The op
posing candidates are not limited' to the
presiding officers, but the factional lines
are carried on down the list to clerks,
sergeants-at-arms and everything.
Many leading ! Republicans from . Ohio
have visited Washington the past week
and none of them reports any prospect
of peace or compromise, so the indica
tions are that the contest will continue
for almost three, weeks longer.

NATIONAL AID
FOR IRRIGATION
Bill to Be Introduced in
Congress After the
Holidays.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â The commit
tee of seventeen Senators and members of
the House appointed by the fu-* Congress
ional representation from the western
arid land States to draft a bill providing
for national aid for irrigation has com
pleted the bill, but it will not be intro
duced in either house of Congress until
after the holidays. The bill embodies
some of the provisions of both the Sha
roth and the Hansbrough-Newlands bills.
Its central idea is the devotion of the pro
ceeds of the sale of the public lands to the
reclamation of those lands. It also in
creases the price of the public lands to be
benefited by the proposed irrigation en
terprises so as to make settlers pay part
of the cost of construction.
The bill provides that moneys received
from the sale and disposal of public
lands in the arid land States shall be set
aside. as a reclamation fund: that examin
ation and surveys of reservoir sites, tun
nel sites for diversion of water and irri
gation , canals to be connected therewith
shall be made; that the Secretary of the
Interior may withdraw from public entry
the lands required for irrigation works
and the public lands proposed to be iriigat
ed by them, and that upon the determina
tion being reached that any irrigation
project is practicable a contract shall be
made for its construction if the estimate
of the engineer shows that the cost will
not exceed $10 per acre on the land to be
reclaimed. ' â 
After construction" the lands to be Irri
gated are to be subject to homestead en
try in areas not exceeding eighty acres
upon the entryman's paying $5 per acre
to the reclamation fund. This fund is to
be used for the construction and main
tenance of reservoirs and irrigation works
until payments for the land settled upon
are made, when all the irrigation works
except the reservoirs shall be turned over
to the settlers who are required as a body
corporate to operate and maintain them.
It also provides that In the event that
there is sufficient water for public and pri
vate lands, water rights may be sold for
the irrigation of private lands at a price
of not less than $5 per acre. â¢
Full power is given to condemn lands
needed for reservoirs and ditch purposes.
It is provided that State laws shall gov
ern in the matters of the appropriation
and distribution of .water. Power to make
general rules and regulations Is vested in
the Secretary of the Interior.
eral Â»others are supposed to have been
killed, but their names have not been
learned. Two elderly women were hurt in
ternally, and neither is expected to sur
vive. Fourteen persons were more or
less seriously hurt. Among * the injured
was Advance Agent Sycle of the McPhse
Company.
The train was going at the ' rate of
twenty-five miles an hour, when it broke
in two. The air brakes were â  set imme
diately, preventing a more serious acci
dent. The larger number of Injured were
in the day coach. All were asleep at
the time of the accident. The day coach
caught fire, but the flames were extin
guished by the passengers.
ANACONDA, Mont., Dec. 13.â A special
to the Standard from Kalispell saya that
Otto Erickson was the only man killed
in Â» the Great Northern wreck near Es
sex. Ho was probably smothered to
death. â 
Among the Injured are: Joseph Kipp
of Blackfoot, badly bruised about head
and body: John Miller of Blackfoot,
bruised, not severely; Yale Gleason, San
Francisco traveling man, bruised, not se
riously; Mr. Tycle, address unknown, bad
ly cut and bruised. In all nineteen pas
sengers are reported injuredv
this work will mean self-denial all around,
but you have shown In the past that the
future may safely, be left in your hands."
The new church takes the place of the
edifice that was burned down in 1897. The
fire also destroyed the pastoral residence,
the gfrls' school and the parish hall. All
these buildings have been replaced by
handsome buildings and now the building
of the new church is well under way.
Among the priests present at the cere
monies were:
Fathers McSweeney, Butler, Cantwell. Mc-
Nally. Riordan, O'Connell. Nugent, Connolly.
Coyle, Carahar, Lane and Scanlan.
The societies which took part were
Societa de Christofero Columbo, St. Patrick s
Alliance. Y. M." I.. Ancient Order of Hiber
nians, Catholic Knights - of America, the
Junior Rank Y. M. I. of Alameda and the
League of the Cross Cadets from St. Francis de

FEAR OUTBREAK
AMONG FILIPINOS
Spirit of Rebellion Re
vives in the Island
of Luzon.
General Chaffee Takes Vigor
ous Measures to Prevent
a Massacre.
PEKING, Dec. 16.â A private letter re
ceived here from an American general at
Manila, whose position gives his state
ments the highest authority, says that
secret service reports from all the pro
vinces of the island of Luzon show a re
markable and -widespread revival of the
spirit of rebellion there. This letter says
the American army expects a general out
break throughout the Island of Luzon, and
is taking vigorous measures to suppress
it. Manila is the center of discontent.
General Chatfee has frequent parades of
the garrison through the city streets to
display the American strength, and, fear
ing an attempt at a general massacre of
Americans, arrangements have been per
fected to concentrate the American
women and children In the public build
ings on short notice.
MANILA, Dec. 15.â General Franklin
Bell has been exceedingly active In Ba
tang-as province, where he intends by
every means available to , stamp out the
insurgents.
Lieutenant Hennessy of the Eight In
fantry, together with one American scout
and six Filipinos, captured an Insurgent
major with forty-two men, twenty-two
rifles and 8SO rounds of ammunition, with
out the loss of a man.
A number of captured documents and
papers, now In the hands of General Beil,
Implicate in the insurrection the presi
dente and other prominent natives at
Li an, Batangas province.
General Bell has notified the natives in
Batangas that on December 2S he proposes
to concentrate them in the neighborhood
of the towns. He will move their live
stock, rice. etc.. to within the limits of
concentration. After that date everything
outside these limits will be confiscated.
The roads from Batangas and Lacuna
provinces are lined with a continuous
stream of native men, women and chil
dren, in carry-alls, carts and mounted on
cariboos, seeking safety from the horrors
of war.
The column under Colonel Theodore J.
Wlnt of the Sixth Cavalry is zealous in
Its operations against the insurgents, and
has received high praise from the military
authorities.
The insurgent General Torre?, who was
found guilty by a military commission of
ordering the assassination of an Ameri
can corporal and sentenced to be hanged,
but whose sentence was disapproved by
General Chaffee, broke down when he was
released. He said it was just that his
life be spared, because he was innocent
of the crime imputed to him. He has ex
pressed his highest regard and warmest
feelings for General Chaffee and his ap
preciation that the supreme military pow
er in the Philippines is in the hands of
such a man. Torres says he is submis
sive to the existing conditions.

THERE IS NO SUCH CONDITION AS
weakness in a man under fifty years oC
â gre, other than general debU'.tj-. Prerr.ature-
ness, loss of vitality, etc.. are but symptorru
of some damage to the reproductive system,
caused by a contracted disorder or ear'y din- *
slpation. In looking for the location of this
damage we generally flnd an enlarged. Â»woll*n
and inflamed prostate gland. As this gland is
the very center of the reproductive system It
can readily be understood that inflammation of
It must cause disordered function. These casÂ«i
arÂ« promptly benefited by proper treatment;
otherwise the patient goes from bad Jo worse.
The essential point in all of th?m Is the neces-
sity of the cure of the focus of the trouble in
the prostate. Many men have unsuccessfully
treated for. a weakness rnd become discour-
aged, when if an antiphlogistic plan of fx*at'
ment had been adopted instead of tonics â
cure would have been the result. In cur er
perience there Is no drug in the pharmaccperx
taken into the stomach, that will even benefit
this class of cases. Our plan of treatment la
entirely a local one and prompt results itre ob-
tained, as indicated by Increased circulation

HEINE PIANO CO.. 217 Geary st.
A GOOD thing to recollect is this: We do not
reckon a sale complete unless the customer
gets all he is entitled to. We give a perfect.
Â»ound and undamaged new piano for Ies3
money than is often asked for patched up
and made over Instruments, worked off under 'j
all sorts of disguises. It is much better t>f^
get a reliable new piano that is known, than
a "bargain" that is good only for the time*
being. Our pianos or customers are not
"wrecked." Ask about our new plan of
$1 50 per week. We se:.l Wissner. Decker

SOLDIERS FROM DETENTION CAMP
BEING FLEECED ON WATER FRONT
ps-rj-^ HE bunko steerers*, "grafters"
I and' others not criminal but high
,1 ly obnoxious who look upon the
Ji discharged . soldiers ' as legitimate
prey are having trouble with the
police at Clay-street wharf these days.
There ; are nearly, 1000 discharged soldiers
on Angel Island, and these are paid off
at the rate- of about 150 a day. They
come â¢â : over-- from the .island* on' the
Piper- Aden-Goodall Company's chartered
steamer Grace Barton, and- are landed at
Clay-street wharf. Once ashore they are
importuned" by hotel runners, ticket
agents arid bunko steerers and "grafters.
Each soldier has from $100 to $250, and all
are anxious to g.et home by the shortest
route, j In consequence, some of them fall
an easy prey to the sharpers.
Captain Dunleavy has had his eye upon
the bunko men and others of a criminal
character for a couple of days. Yesterday
he ordered the men under . him. to maks
arrests of any one overstepping the law.
The bunko men had escaped thus far,
but yesterday morning George Newbauer
was booked' on a charge of violating the
hack ordinance, and to-day when the
steamer arrives from the camp a posse
of police will be there. to meet her- and
more arrests are sure to follow.
The soldiers in" the detention camp -are
making a vigorous kick because they are
not. paid off at once, ; and some of them,
â who are in the city on . '"shore leave,"'
will not go back until the last moment,
as no more leaves will be granted.
BULLET MISSES DOG.
â Window in Office Perforated Instead
. . of Canine.
Fred Jacobs was charged at the Harbor
police station yesterday morning by Po
liceman. Dower and Burns with discharg
ing firearms on the street. Fred had been
celebrating, and the water front whisky
fired his imagination. -When on the cor
ner of Steuart! and Market streets he
saw a dog crossing the street. "See me
kill that coyote," said he.. At the game
moment he drew a revolver from his
hip pocket, and, aiming at the dog, fired.
The bullet struck â  the pavement in front
of the Rococo saloon,. and, richochetting,
flew upward and went through the win
dow of the Pacific Coast Steamship-Com
pany's offices.
The Overdue Fleet.
The British ship Glenericht, which left
here fourteen days ->g" for Portland, is
how quoted at 25 per cent by the 'rein
surance brokers, j. he ship was oft port
a fortnight ago, and was ordered to th'a
Columbia River. She was, in ballast, and
her owners now fear that she was caught
in the gale that has caused so much dam
age along the coast. The gamblers think
she is "as safe as a church," however,
and are playing her to arrive.
The Renfteld, now out seventy-four
days from Pisagua (nitrate port) for.Port
land, is quoted at 15 per cent; the William
Mitchell, 146 days from Table Bay for
Portland, is quoted at 20 per cent; the
Robert Duncan, seventy-five days from
Wei Hai Wei to Puget Sound, is quoted
at 40 per cent; the Anglia, from New
castle, Australia, for Panama, and now
out 162 days, at 80 per cent, while the
Matteawan from Nanalmo, B. C-, and
given up as lost, is quoted at 90 s-ar cent.
The Matteawan is not being gambled
upon', but the Anglia has quite a number
of followers, as they figure on the dead
calms that prevail In the Gulf of Panama
having detained the vessel.

ASSASSIN ALMOST DECAPITATES
DEFENSELESS CHINESE COOK
Highbinder of the Bing Kong Tbng Skulks Into
Jackson-Street Lodging-House, Entices Victim
to the Door and Cruelly Slays Him With a Hatchet
Hacked to death with a hatchet in the
hands of a murderous fighting man of the
Bing Kong Tong was the cruel fate that
befell Wong Fook, a Tim Kee man, in his
room in a lodging house at 607 Jackson
Btreet, shortly before 6 o'clock last nlght.
The murder was one of the foulest that
has grown out of Â«. -e present highbinder
war which has been going on in China
town since Thanksgiving day. The mur
dered man was horribly cut on the head
and shoulders. One wound at the base of
the skull nearly severed the head from the
body and must have caused instant death.
It is said by those who are familiar -with
the differences between the warring fac
tions that Wong Fook, the murdered Chi
naman, was the victim of mistaken iden
tity. He was living In a little room on the
second floor of the building where the
murder occurred, with three members of
the Â£uey Sing Tong, and it is believed
that a Bing Kong Tong hatchetman slew
Fook, thinking he was one of the Suey
Sing men.
â  The murdered roan was a native son and
was known to be very religious. His
friends claim that he was in no way impli
cated in the present troubles and this
statement strengthens the theory and
general belief existing in Chinatown last
night that "Wong Fook was slain by a
highbinder who was too cowardly to take
time to identify his victim before he dealt
the death blows with the hatchet. It was
the first case i- hatchet warfare that has
occurred for over a year.
Goes to Horrible Death.
Wong Fook was in his room preparing
his evening meal when the highbinder
knocked at his door. The hallway outside
was dark and Wong Fook opened his door
to a horrible death thai lurked in the
shadows. His murderer first struck him a
blow en the top of the head with the blunt
ANGELUS
PIANO PLAYER
RECITAL
Saturday Next, 3 p. m.,
at Sherman-Clay Hall.
Owing to the fact that great Interest
has been taken in the Angelus and as
the exhibition room in the store is not
large, Sherman, Clay & Co. have de-
cided to hold an Angelus Recital in
Sherman-Clay Hall Saturday after-
noon, December 21. at 3 o'clock.
The programme v.ill constitute num-
bers from the old masters as well as
popplar music.
There will be no admission charged,
but to prevent overcrowding of the
hall tickets should be procured at
Sherman. Clay & Co.'s store, Sutter
and Kearny, after Tuesday.
The Anselus is a small instrument
which enables anybody to play the
piano with all the feeling and expres-
sion of a master of the pianoforte.
This occasion affords a splendid op-
portunity for seeing the wonderful
achievements of this remarkable in-
vention.
Eherman, Clay & Co. extend you a
cordial invitation to the recital.

end of the hatchet, and, when the unfor
tunate man fell*tt> the floor, the assassin
fiendishly sank the sharpened blade of the
weapon into his skull and body. Then he
stealthily shambled along in the darkened
hallway to the stairway and made his es
cape unseen to the street. The cowarulv
crime was committed quietly and the
murderer left no clew but the hatchet,
which was found lying in a pool of blood
beside the victim.
Detective Ed Gibson received a tip
shortly after 6 o'clock that trouble had
occurred in the building where Fook
lodged. Gibson and Sergeant Conboy hur
ried to the scene, but upon arriving they
found everything quiet. The other lodgers
in the building stated to the police of
ficials that they had heard of no trouble,
and believing that the report was "a
canard they left the place. A short time
later another Chinaman told Detective
Gibson that a man had been shot In the
Jackson-street building and the officers
went again to the scene. '
Police Find the Body.
They knocked at the door of Jew Foo,
secretary of the Six Companies, who told
them he had heard some noise in the rear
of the building-. Detective Gibson went
to the rear of the building and on open
ing Wong Fook's door a ghastly sight
was presented. The murdered Chinaman
lay across the room In a bloody pool with
his head dangling in the woodbox.
Wong Fook was a cook and has been
employed, on various coastwise steamers.
The murder of Fook will undoubtedly
cause more trouble In Chinatown. It in
dicates an outbreak of hostilities between
the Bing Kong Tong and the Suey Sings.
As the war between the Bing Kong Tong
and the Four Families Is still on the
Chinatown squad will probably be kept
busy. Up to a late hour this morning the
police had developed no clew to the slayer
of Wong Kook.

E. H. Spencer Says Diamond Was
Taken From Him in B'nai
B'rith Hall. 1
E. H. Spencer, who- recently came to
this city from Denver, and who resides
at 327 O'Farrell street, reported to the
police last night that he had been robbed
of a 1360 diamond necktie pin. Spencer,
while out viewing: the attractions of this
city, happened to visit B'nai B'rith Hall,
where a dance was in progress. While
he was in the hall, he claims, a, number
of young men who, he says, had been
casting covetous glances at the $360 dia
mond which he was wearing in his neck
tie, made an attack upon him. He told
the police that they, mauled him about
the hall, and in the scrimmage stole his
pin. . y
Spencer first reported his loss to Of
ficer Wilson. The officer accompanied him
to the Hall of Justice, where he gave a
detailed account of the theft te Acting
Captain Joh'n Martin. The acting captain
detailed officers to make, an investi
gation. â  â¢ /,-â 
At an early hour this morning Police
man Cullman arrested three young men,
Thomas Hendon, John Boyle and F. E.
Dupont, on suspicion of having been Im
plicated In the theft of the diamond. As
they were unable to satisfactorily ex
plain their actions during the evening
they were placed under arrest and their
names registered in the detenue book.
The police will make a'Turther investiga
tion to-day. 'a -v â â â¢":>".â¢

marriage to the Shasta girl. ,
Telegram Announces Marriage.
Thursday last Haley and Miss Nielson
disappeared and according to Miss
"Amelie Nielsen, Miss Leo's sister, the
'following: telegram, dated at Neno, Nev.,
was received by her mother Friday:..
P . Ned and I were married here to-day. LEO.
! But little further information could Be
obtained at the Nielsen residence onUni
,versity;avenue, Berkeley. Mrs. Nielaenac
knowledged the departure of her daugh
ter and Haley, but stated that no par
ticulars of the wedding could be given
, out until the two returned. "I do not
know when they will' return," said the
mother, "and: I can tell nothing regard
ing their marriage." Mrs. Nielsen is
greatly grieved over her daughter's ven
ture.
Do Not Know First Wife.
Mrs. J. E. Morehquse, a sister of
young Haley and who resides on Berke
ley way, East Berkeley, had this to say
regarding, the elopement:
BERKELEY GIRL WHO ELOPED
WITH OLD-TIME SWEETHEART
AND WEDDED HIM IN RENO.
I â¢ have heard rumors that Ned has goc
away with Miss Nielsen, but I do not kno'
whether they are true. -I- have never " hear
that , my brother was divorced, and if he
It is news to me. He has been employed for
the 'last seven years at Upton and was mar
ried less than a year ago to a girl there. He
was formerly engaged to Miss Nielsen, but the
match was broken oft for some reason which
I never learned. His wife was visiting in San
Francisco recently, but Ned was not with her
thÂ«n so far as I know. I was told that he
was in West Berkeley last Sunday. His wife
Is now in Placerville with friends.
A peculiar circumstance connected with
Haley's ; first marriage is that neither
his sister nor Miss Nielsen's relatives
know the name of his' first wife.
BREAKS THE WINDOWS
OF PAROCHIAL RESIDENCE
Miss Belle Thelmey Smashes Glass in
Home of Pastor of St. Pat
rick's * Church.
Miss Belle ' Thelmey, while temporarily
suffering from dementia, last night began
to break the windows of the parochial res
idence of the pastor of St. 'Patrick's
Church. The unfortunate woman was
placed under arrest by Officer W. H. Har
rison and removed to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where one of her hands,
which had been cut by the. broken glass,
was dressed. She was detained at the hos
pital on a charge of insanity.
This is not the first time that Miss Thel
mey has developed a mania for breaking
windows, but hitherto she has confined
her attentions to those of her own housÂ»
at 211 Minna street. As far as is known
by the police window breaking is the only
way In which the unfortunate woman has
given signs of mental derangement.

OPPENSEIM'S SLAYER
/ NOT YET DISCOVERED
Police Still Adhere to the Theory
That the Shooting Was
, . Accidental.
The detectives have practically given up
any hope of finding the man who fired the
fatal shot . at , Adolph Oppenheim In his
shooting gallery â  on Dupont street late
Thursday night. Every possible clew has
been closely followed without any result.
The officers still adhere to the theory
that the shot was accidental and that the
man. -who fired it either does not know
that the bullet had struck Oppenheim or
is afraid to make himself known.
The inquest will probably be held to
morrow, but Captain Seymour does not
expect to have any further- evidence to
offer than that already published. The
theory that business rivalry had anything
to do with the shooting is scouted by the
police.
