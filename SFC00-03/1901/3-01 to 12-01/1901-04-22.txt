Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, April 21. â Tour correspondent
had an Interview this morning -with
Aguinaldo. He was greeted cordially by
the ex-rebel leader, who was in excellent
spirits. Aguinaldo Is still non-committal,
fearing that if he talks on the situation
he will be misrepresented and his posi
tion thus jeopardized. He said:
"I will make no definite statements on
public or private questions until I am
familiar with the situation. I am learn
ing English, and studying American gov
ernment."
When asked if he desired to visit the
United States Aguinaldo replied:
"Tea, greatly; but I am at the disposi
tion of the authorities."
The correspondent then asked him for
his opinion of. the scheme looking: to the
purchase of church estates by the Gov
ernment and their sale to the natives.
Aguinaldo said he thought that such a
scheme would be satisfactory, but ha
added that he was not familiar with the
proposal. He. said he generally endorsed
the acts of the Philippine Commission,
which he had followed Interruptedly in
the newspapers for the last half year. He
had been secluded In the mountains, how
ever, and therefore was not very -well in
formed on current events.
The correspondent presented to him a
photograph of his son, Miguel, which was
taken the day the latter was captured
near San Fabian. Agulnaldo thanked the
correspondent warmly, and said that it
had been reported the boy was dead. He
added, jokingly:
"Whatever else I am accused of, I am
not responsible for the rumors that were
circulated while I was in the field."
. Continuing he said: "I was often very
dose to the Americans. I expected to
make my greatest stand at Calumpit.
"When I abandoned Tarlac I commanded
1500 riflemen. I anticipated General
Wheaton's landing at San Fabian. I
planned to retreat to Nueva Vlscaya, but
was frustrated by brave General Lawton.
I slipped through the cordon with 250
men. only four hours before the landing
party came ashore."
In response to a. auestion concerning
his opinion of the American troops, he
said:
"How terrible are the Americans! They
are splendid and ferocious fighters. I no
sooner built arsenals and barracks than
they destroyed them. Colonel March
chased me in the most lively manner for
two months In the western mountains, un
til I worked eastward with thirty horses
and eighty men. I crossed to Cagayan
and lived on the east coast for eight
months. My outposts often saw the Am
ericans, but I did not participate In a
single engagement, though I once com
manded 40,000 riflemen. The watchfulness
of the army and navy practically de
stroyed filibustering to Luzon.
"I do not desire to discuss Insular poli
tics. I am undecided as to my future
plans. I believe that the Federals will be
strong agents in the pacification of the
archipelago. This Is the first Interview
that I have given to any one."

FILIPINO ENLISTMENTS

WASHINGTON, April 21.-In the opin
ion of the President the value of a Filipino
is just one-half that of a person enlisted
in the navy at any other point than the
Philippine Islands. This Idea of the in
feriority of the natives of the Philippine*

Navy Department publishing an executive

China, who is now at Shanhai-Kwan, sent
a company of Punjab infantry to dis

Viceroy To Orders the Capture and

Execution of Bandits.
TACOMA, April 21.â To-day's mall ad
vices from Hongkong give details of en
ergetic preparations being made by Vice
roy To at Canton to capture and execute
robbera and bandits throughout tho two
Kwang provinces.,* For years bandits and
pirates have practically ruled Southern
China. They have become much bolder
during the disturbances in Northern
China until the officials were powerless to
cope with them. Viceroy To was appoint
ed at the special instance of U Hung
Chang and directed to employ all his
power to .kijl off the rohbera- and bring
about a restoration of peaceful trade.
Viceroy To declares that bad characters
in the villages and towns are undoubtedly
well known to the gentry- He therefore
orders the gentry in each town to imme
diately prepare lists of the names of all
doubtful persons and present them with
out delay to the local mandarins. It is
ordered that as fast as any person on
these lists is caught In any wrongdoing
he shall ' be arrested and executed. To.
encourage soldiers to do their duty,' com
pensation will be granted those who are
wounded and their families will be pen
sioned in case of death. Large sums are
promised to Informers and a free pardon
to any robber who is instrumental in
bringing three notorious robbers to jus
tice. As many robbers are known as be
ing men of substance, it is agreed that
their property shall be divided among in
formers, Villages failing to comply with
the Viceroy's orders are threatened with
destruction!. Soldiers are warned against
using their position to extort money.
Viceroy To estimates that at least 3000
bandits will be executed under these or
ders this summer.
A correspondent of the Hongkong Mail

French and German Force Will Num

PAOTING-FU, April 20.â This city has
been for the past four days a big mili
tary camp of French and German soldiers
on the way to the front. It Is now esti
mated < that 8000 French troops and 6000
Germans will form the entire force when
all the reinforcements have arrived.
There is no truth In current reports . re
garding severe fighting between the out
posts and the Chinese. !
Three men left yesterday under escort
to convey Emperor Kwang Su's first or
der to General Liu to retire immediately
to the province of Shansi. Prince Chlng
and other Chinese officials say the Chi
nese general has already retired; but
their confirmations or denials are con
sidered very unreliable.
The French and German troops seem to
be co-operating fairly well, although un
til yesterday (Friday) there was some
doubt as to who would command the ex
pedition. This auestion has been settled
by an arrangement under which the
French and Germans are to work Inde
pendently and yet. at the same time, to
co-operate.
If the Chinese ; retire over the Shansi
boundary, then, according to internation
al agreement, the foreign troops should
not go beyond it. The Ministers of. the
powers in Peking earnestly hope that this
will prove to be the case. They point out
that the Chinese force has not been ag
gressive, and came only a few miles over

Trouble Over Money Question.
In, Paris the general inference concern-
.Ing the strange mutual behavior -of the
Duke and the Duchess is that the Duke
had become, soured because of some
money auestion, wherein he had expected
the Vanderbilts to show themselves . more â¢
liberal than they were. A woman friend
of both the Duke and the Duchess said
to-day: r
"The news has -. been cabled back from
New i _Tork,' > that,.their ..; estrangement . has.
">beeh published. * This fact may bring
them together. The closest associates of
the Marlboroughs have long been aware
that the fire of love was not burning so
brightly between them as of old, and It
was understood that they had decided to
live as independently of one another as
strict decorum would permit. But, as
both are socially and politically ' ambl
Â¦ tlous, they will endure much disagreeable
friction before coming to an open breach.
"Now that the estrangement has be
come public property, they will do their
utmost. to stop comment. This, doubtless,
is why the Duchess, probably advised by
her clever father, sought out her hus
band, and refused to permit him. to leave-
Paris alone.
"I believe that in their Interview to
day the Duchess represented to the Duke
that all chances of him becoming Viceroy
of Ireland, now their one acute ambition,
would be hopelessly blasted by a public
breach between them. King Edward hav
ing become exceedingly ticklish upon mat

While the Duke was in Spain the Duchess

NEW YORK. April 21.â The World's

decline to divulge any facts, rather show

of infelicity X)r to lessen its Importance.
It is true, nevertheless, that during the
three weeks that the Duchess has been
here she has .remained under her father's
roof at 13S Avenue des Champs Ely

Vanderbilt family returned from Cannes,
left Paris the next day for Spain, with
out even seeing his wife or his father-in

Henry Bratnobsr t>.nd a Few Friends
Clear a Round Million
Pounds Sterling.
Special Cable to The Call and Xew York Her
ald. Copyright. 1901. by the Herald Pub
lishing Company.
LONDON. April 21.â The echoes of the
London and Globe liquidation are fitfully
heard in the vicinity of Lombard street
and Lothbury, where official liquidators
have been engaged for weeks past on the
Herculean task of clearing up accounts,
a task which threatens to outlive even
the capture of Dewct.
Some of the stories related by Whitaker
Wright to-night at the last meeting of the
shareholders are spoken of now as akin
to old Â¦ nursery rhymes told to children.
For instance, the yarn about wicked con
spirators who sought to corrupt a mine
manager with a bribe of Â£100.000, but
whose machinations were just nipped be
fore, fruition by the unfortunate collapse
of the London and Globe, is now regarded
as fiction of the weakest kind. The much
vaunted legal action against the treacher
ous Lake View syndicate, which sold out
right under the nose of the directors of
the London and Globe, Is also pigeon
holed as among things no longer men
tioned.
Meantime there departed yesterday by
the Lucania Heniy Bratnober of San
Francisco and a few friends who have
no reason to complain of their connection
with Whitaker Wright. It is understood
that this combination, which operated on
the bear side of the London and Globe
group, cleared a round million sterling by
the operation.
In London the anticipated advent of J.
Pierpont Morgan has been signalized by
dealings in American Industrial stocks.
Since it has become customary in Eng
land to speak of the great Wall-street
magnate as a steel trust potentate it nat
urally followed that the first dealings in
Americanvlndustrials were all in steel
trust sharp. To be perfectly candWrhcw-
ever, it is only fair to state that the deal
ings in these" stocks were limited, as they
were mostly confined to an American cli
entele.
For the steel 7 per cent Dref erred $98
was freely offered when outside trading
began, all of the trading being, of course,
on the curb, owing to the fact that the
stock has not yet been listed on the Lon
don Stock Exchange. But the supply
proved too much for the applicants and
those who came late were fortunate in
paying only $96 for the stock.
The difficulty of trading in this, as in
all American industrial stocks, is that
the British speculative public cannot un
derstand how shares can spring Into ex
istence without a chance of making a pre
mium of the first allotment. If the Bank
of England were to -Issue fully paid or
fully underwritten stock, even 7 per cent
preferred, British parsons and old maids
who keenly scent a prospective premium
would hardly apply for a pound's worth.
Henry Bratnober, who, together with a
few friends, is credited with having
cleared Â£1,000,000 through the collapse of
the London and Globe Corporation, Is
well known and very popular at the Pal
ace Hotel, where he and his wife resided
shortly before his departure for the scene
of his latest successes. Mrs. Bratnober
did not accompany h:r husband to Eng
land, but took up her residence in Pied
mont, where she is at present.

against his apparent suicidal Intent, when
Canby lowered the weapon and left the

while outside he attempted to kill him
self, as on returning he threw down the
pistol, remarking: "The gun is no good
and will not go off."
. In answer to an Inquiry from Maxwell
if he was implicated in the criminal en
try i Brown replied: "Yes, I am equally
guilty."
District Attorney Gay "stated to-day
that, there is evidence that the criminal
acts of the two officials cover, a i period
of several years, and only by a thorough
Investigation of the books can their full
extent be known.
Canby carried $13,000 Insurance on his
life and Brown carried policies aggregat

Bodies of Two Embezzlers Found

VANCOUVER. Wash.. April 21.-Charles
Brcwn and E. L. Canby, president and
cashier respectively of the First Xatlonal
Bank of Vancouver, which was closed
yesterday by the Controller of the Cur
rency, committed suicide last night two
railes from this city by shooting them
selves with a revolver.
The bodies of the men were found this
morning lying together In a small clump
of bushes about a half mile north of the
Columbia School, which Is situated on the
outskirts of the town. They both used
the same weapon, and Canby evidently
died first, as the revolver was found in
Hrcwn's hand. It is evident that Canby
put the muzzle of the revolver in his
mouth and then blew the top of his head
off. Brown then took it and shot him
self In exactly the same way, falling over
Canby's body.
The fact that Brown's bicycle and an
Â¦umbrella belonging to Canby were found
a. short distance out of town last night led
to the belief that the two bank officials
nad taken their lives. Early this morning
a searching party started out, and after
several hours' hunt the bodies were found
Jn the clump of bushes.
First Attempt at Suicide.
Friday evening Canby. upon being told
Â¦by Eank Examiner J. W. Maxwell that
the bank would not be permitted to open
Saturday, went out In the yard behind
the bank and attempted to shoot himself.
His revolver failed to explode, although
all five chambers were loaded. After fail
ing to shoot himself Canby came back
into the bank and he and President Brown
left together, the latter taking his revol
ver. When Examiner Maxwell confronted
the bank officials with the shortage of
JSI.900 which he had discovered both men
admitted their guilt. It is said that
Brcwn and Canby had been speculating
In stocks. Besid* Brown's body there was
found a package containing Â£5 and a note,
saying that the money belonged to his
daughter. Upon Canby's body the follow
ing brief note was found:
"My dear wife: 1 feel what I am about

Brown, who was 54 years of age, had
lived in Vancouver since 1862. His father
was the first Receiver of the Vancouver
I^and Office. He has served as Auditor
of. Clark County, was married and has a
family. His connection with the bank as
its president dates back ten years.
Canby was C2 years old and was well
connected. His wife was Miss Frances
Burnside, daughter of an Oregon pioneer.
He has a brother, who is a paymaster in
the United States army. Another brother
committed suicide by Jumping off. the

While Bank Examiner Maxwell, now
in chare* as receiver, has made no offi
cial statement, it is known that the bank
has loaned a large sum of money on in
sufficient security. According to the re
port to the Controller of the Currency,
there is a shortage of $S1.000 In the bank's
accounts, and it is understood that a con
siderable portion of th's amount was
loaned to Brown and Canby on their per

reduced its capital stock from $100,000 to

end ever since that time he has been the
heaviest stockholder. According to the
last statement Issued In February the
bank had deposits amounting to about

From the condition of the "bodies and
other circumstances It Is almost certain
that the suicides occurred between 7 and
8 o'clock Friday evening. Two pistol
Â»=hots comlnff from the direction where
the bodies were found were heard at that
hour by L. B. Rand, who lives a quarter
of e mile distant.
Following the arrival of United States
District Attorney Wilson R. Gay last
r.Ight a warrant was" Issued by Judgo
Miller of the Superior Court, charging
Brown and Canby with the embezzlement
of $10,000 of the funds of the "bank on Jan

four charges of embezzlement and mis

FIEE COMMUNICATIONS CUT OFF
The Â¦VTestln^house Klectric Company
had two carloads of finished material on
the tracks near Turtle Creek. They were
caught in the flood and water got into the
cars. The loss may reach $80,000.
On the Fort Wayne the worst trouble
was a snow blockade between Salem and
Massillon. This tied up the road for twen
ty-four hours. The same trouble kept the
Cleveland trains of the Pittsburg and
Lake Erie late, five trains having been
blockaded at Windom, near Levittsburg,
for twenty-five hours.
At Skobo the Lake Erie received its
most serious landslide. One hundred feet
of westbound track were carried down the
Fleep bank, tho whole face of the bank
Flipping- down into the river. On the lines
of the Pennsylvania and Baltimore and
Ohio, to Wheeling, great damage is re
ported.
The damage to telegraph poles and lines
along all the roads was enormous, and it
will take several days to fully repair
them. Trains are now running on all
roads, but no attention is paid to keeping
up to schedule.
The submerged districts in Pittsburg
and Allegheny are to-day a scene of abject
misery- The residents spent all day try
ing to restore their homes to some degree
of decency and comfort. The damage to
furniture and building's in Allegheny is es
timated at about $100,000. It will take two
months cf hot summer weather to thor
oughly dry out the houses. In Pittsburg
the loss to residences and stores and
goods and the cost of cleaning up will
amount to about $250,000.
At Carnegieborough, six miles from
Pittsburg, the !oss is estimated at $40,000,
of which the Columbia Bridge Works lose
$5000.
While there have been greater floods at
this point, there was â¢ never one that
caused so mucn financial loss and discom
fort. The loss to the railroads entering
Pittsburg from flood, landslides, wrecked
bridges, heavy tnow and the interference
with traffic is roughly estimated at
% 1.000,000.
PITTPBURG, April 2Lâ Pittsburg and
Allegheny are rlowly emerging from the

ary until about 3 p.m.. when it'began to

damage in this district is between two

BURST DAM CAUSES DISASTER.
LONDON, April 21.â Great curiosity 1#
manifested here to ascertain how half
the war loan has been already placed, as
Is asserted In the Government Invitation
for subscriptions for the remaining half.
It is supposed that a portion of the Â£30,
000,000 "already placed" may have been re
served for the Government i Department ;
but it is rather believed . that financial
houses with foreign connections have in
terested '; themselves in- the flotation.
No explanation . has been afforded j and
considering that the final . Installment ' of
the loan is payable in December and that
the first ".quarter's interest will be paid
July 5 the issue is regarded as cheap, and
not a- little resentment has been created
by the fact that only half the issue has
been offered to the public.
This dissatisfaction is voiced -by the
Daily Chronicle, which says: "The pub
lic ought to. have been informed by this
time to whom the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer has allotted Â£30,000,000 of the is
sue." b The paper proceeds to comment
severely upon the policy of the Govern
ment which has led. to "such a disastrous

"Philip Gunn was brought to the City

that a stab wound three-quarters of an

the breast bone, and on a level with the
fifth rib, had been inflicted. / An examin

very, feebly. The radial artery â¢ and

very pale and there was every indication

VIncisions were made ' and _the heart

it was necessary to resort : to artificial

was free and it was' noticed that the right
ventricle had been pierced. A penetrating
incised wound about one-third of an inch
in length was found. Bleeding from the
heart at this time was quite rapid and
the patient lost considerable blood.
The wound was stitched last night by
Dr. H. L. Nietert, Superintentendent of

BERLIN, April 21.â The Berlin Boerse

LONDON, April 21.â With the exception
of American securities, which continued
to be buoyant, the promised Increase of
activity on the Stock Exchange following
the budget announcement was mostly un
realized. The effect of the budget wa3
largely discounted by â¢ careful j operators.
The coal | and sugar, duties -had* been con
sidered Inevitable and brokers are thank
ful that they are no worse. "The only ap
preciable effect of the announcement of
the budget was that some operators sold
consols down to 94%, which is the lowest
price since 1891. This low price brought
in a number of buyers and there was con
sequently some recovery at a net loss of
only %.
The. prospectus of the new loan Is ex
pected in a day or two. The price will
probably be 93%, with a discount-off. Some
speculative contracts have already been
made at three-quarters premium, "what
ever the announced price may^be.
During the week home rails were down
% to 2 per cent, but dealings therein were
limited. Foreign government bonds were
moderately active, and ' there was some,
buying for Continental account of Brazil
ian bonds.
Money during the past week was alto
gether easier in tone.- On account of . the
large Government disbursements, coupled
with the gold receipts from the provinces
and abroad, the reserve has risen to
twenty-three and three-quarter millions.
The prosoect of the >new loan makes
brokers cautious about lowering the dis
count rates. Money rates were lower
during the past week by one-half per cent
to 2% per cent at call, and by 2% per cent
at notice. :â¢â¢'Â¦ -* .'.' â¢Â¦*' Â¦'-.''*
The Frankfurter Zeltung, commenting'
upon the purchase of the Chicago, Bur
lington and "Qulncy Railroad In unfavor
able terms, compares the transaction to
the methods of Jay Gould and James Flsk
and probably blames Mr. Hill, observing:
"Mr. Hill Is responsible for i purchasing
the road at the present Inflated value of
the stock, because he controls 500^)00
shares, which he and his allies bought up
cheap and are now selling to the Northern
Pacific and Great Northern roads at an
enormous profit to themselves, but to tho
disadvantage- of the purchasing lines. The
basis of exchange of the Burlington stock
for the Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific bonds involves a heavy overcapital
ization of the former."

Maria Conkling, wife of ! David Conkling
of Rockhlll, who died suddenly on Thurs
day, had a premonition of her fate and
foretold her death, having been warned in
dreams on three successive nights that her
end was near. The facts in the case,
which are authenticated by members of
her family and by neighbors to whom she
related her dreams while making prepara
tions for the death which she was con
vinced was near, are as follows:
Mrs. Conkling was 49 years old and-ap
parently in perfect health. On Monday
night she dreamed that her daughter, who
died twelve years ago, appeared to her
and beckoned to her; on Tuesday night
her mother, who died about twenty-five
years ago, appeared to her while she slept
and beckoned to her. . She told . these
dreams to her family and was much dis
turbed by them. On Wednesday night she
dreamed that a black-robed figure of
death stood by her bedside holding a taper
and, while it beckoned^ the taper suddenly
went out.
She interpreted the visions as meaning
that death was- near and that it would be
sudden, and made preparations. That af
ternoon, while engaged in household
duties, the final summons came in the
form of a stroke of apoplexy. . '^'

It is suggested that there will be diffi
culty in making all duties specific and
that in many cases, perhaps, ad valorem
duties will be better. There are some ob

goods are in yard folds and European
goods are in metric folds. If the yard
folds are continued it would be better for
the American manufacturers.

No provision is made for marking oleo

Some months ago the War Department
published 1^ the. tariff as prepared by the
experts In the Philippines and approved
by the Taft Commission. Interested per
sons, especially manufacturers and ship
pers, were invited to examine this pro
posed tariff and make suggestions and
criticisms. It is interesting to note that
of the 419 paragraphs in the proposed
tariff only thirty-three have .provoked
criticism or suggestion. Even these are
in a mild tone, and nearly all take the
form of suggestion. Many more impor
tant suggestions are embodied in the fol
lowing.
Some Asked-For Changes. .
WASHINGTON, April 21.â It Is not like
ly that the new Philippine tariff will be
promulgated until after the decision of the
Supreme Court in the insular case. It was
said at the War Department, where the
case has received considerable attention,
that this decision may make it unneces
sary for this Government to establish, a
system of tariff, rates in the Philippines,
although the department has proceeded
with the work of equalizing the rates and
considering suggestions- as though the
coming decision would not make any
change in the present conditions.
A change Is asked In the classification
of meat products. It is said that the duty
on alcohol should be doubled, or manu
facturers of whisky will be able to use the
alcohol at a less cost than the distilled
product.
California manufacturers ask a reduc
tion on flour, cereala, prunes, benzoin,
gasoline and retro!eum, some -of them
suggesting that these articles be placed on
the free list. Condensed milk and canned
fish the Pacific desires should also be
placed on the free list.
One suggestion Â¦ made \s that all mate
rials for the United States forces should
be admitted free of duty.
Some rather Interesting information has
reached the War Department In connec
tion with the tariff, it being shown that
Russia sends to the Philippines two-fifths
of all the petroleum Imported by the peo
ple of the islands.
Reductions are asked of from 20 to 30 per
cent on harness and saddleroakers' wares.
It is suggested that cheap and expensive
machinery should not pay the same rates.
Certain typewriter firms want the duty on
their machines reduced.
Alcohol Rate Too Low.
The dairy Interest believes a provision
desirable. A lower rate Is asked for. gaso
line to be used for fuel and for launches.
An advalorum duty is advised upon pre
cious stone and watches. One suggestion
is that copperas and oxide should be upon
the free list.
It is claimed that cotton yarn should not
be admitted at a lower rate than fabrics
woven from such yarn; also that tho
weight and rating of cotton tissues
should be changed In the interest of coarser
cotton . fabrics. There has been a quite
extensive discussion of this subject, and
it has been pointed out that changes in
the Cuban tariff also were needed in this
particular.
The free entry of "news" print paper Is

than at any period since 1884, when the
Ohio River reached its highest stage of
seventy-one feet and nine inches at this
city. While the water has begun to
fall at Pittsburg. the danger line has al
ready been reached at points above Cin
cinnati, and it will be reached here to
morrow morning. Early this evening the
Weather Bureau here announced heavy
â¢ snows and rains along the Ohio "Valley.
"At Point Pleasant the stage is eight feet
above the danger line to-night, with the
river rising rapidly, with a heavy rain.
The Mayor of Portsmouth, Ohio, tele
graphed that the danger line had been
reached there. Similar reports have been
received from all over Southern Ohio and
as far north as Springfield. Trains are
late on all railroads. It is generally con
ceded that, the fruit crop throughout the
Ohio Valley is gone, and the damage to
crops is very great.

Residents Fire at Passing Packets,
Which Are Washing Away Foun- .
Â¦ - dationduof Houses. â¢
WHEELING, Wi Va., April : 21.â The
river here is 41 feet 4 inches and rising
two inches an hour. Wheeling is entirely
cut off from outside communication by
rail, and only the big Cincinnati liners are
able to run now. Residents along the
river banks are firing frequently at- the
boats because the swell from them is
washing the foundations away from their
houses. To-night a Wheeling Island man
fired at the packet Keystone 'State and at
a passing towboat, but without effect. In
"Wheeling about 500 houses have been, en
tered by the water. Nearly every manu
facturing; establishment in the Wheeling
district is shut down.
The aggregate loss in this district is at
least $100,000. Above Martins Ferry, James
Ford, a miner, discovered the Cleveland
and Pittsburg track washed out and suc
ceeded in stopping the northbound pas
senger train a few yards from certain de
struction. The Ohio River Railroad has

little improvement to the service thus far.
. Throughout the day big gangs of men
have been at work on the various lines re
setting poles and stringing wires. Trains
on. practically all roads entering the city
from the west continue to arrive from one
to three hours behind schedule. This is
especially true of the lines from the
east. There are no wires to facilitate the
movements of trains and this is respon
sible to a large extent for the delay to
traffic. - ,
The traffic on the city street car lines
continued to be badly crippled all day as
a result of the deep snow and slush on the
tracks. So heavy is the snow and slush in
many places that the. most "powerful
sweepers become stalled in it. A large
section of the city is still cut off from
communication by wire with fire head
quarters as a result of the general pros
tration of the -wires. -

PITTSBURG, Pa., April 21,-The report
to-night from Rochester is that the Ohio
has overflowed its banks and a consider
able portion of the city lying south of
the Fort Wayne Railroad track is sub
merged. The river is still rising, and a
steady downpour of rain continues. The
loss to manufacturing plants along- the
river will.be heavy. At Beaver Falls, Pa.,
several sauares in the north end of the
town were converted into a lake. Reports
from up river points! received at Pittsburg
up to 10 p. m. are meager, but for the
most part are encouraging.
The storm left a zone of ruin 200 miles in
diameter.
Some municipalities are in dire straits
from rain. Traffic has been practically
suspended. Water overflowed and washed
out railroad tracks and hillsides, and
came down and buried the rails. In ad
dition, nearly every town- on the Ohio
River between Pittsburg and Wheeling is
in darkness to-night, owing to damaged
wires. '
The money loss is difficult to foot up.
It may reach IS.OOO.OOO. 1 The telegraph
companies have suffered severely.' There
is an enormous indirect damage caused
by suspension of trade.
FIERCE STORMS OF SNOW BLOCK
EASTERN MAIL TRAIN TRAVEL
Telegraph Lines Go Down, Gars Are Stalled

Clean the Streets Get Mired in the Slush
NEW YORK, April 2Lâ Because of the
heavy storm which has been raging in the
East all traffic into Cleveland has been de
layed from two to twelve hours. The
Grand Central depot presented a strange
appearance this afternoon, as the belated
Western trains-arrived several hours late,
with their roofs and steps encrusted with"
enow and ice. Friends of the long-due
passengers hung around the depot all day
and rushed to meet the weary passengers
every time a train came in. The disap
pointments were frequent, as most of the
trains were divided into sections at Buf
falo.
The Atlantic express, which carries all
the mail east of Chicago, and which was
due at 5:30 a. ni., arrived seven hours be
hind time 1 . The New York and New Eng
land express, due at 2:55 p. m., arrived in
two sections, the first section being two
hours and twenty minutes late and the
second section five hours late. The first
section brought with it a Lake Shore train
from the West due at 1:30 p. m. Most of
the Western trains on the Pennsylvania
were also far behind their schedule time.
Oreat difficulty -was experienced in petting
the trains through east of Pittsburg.
At the postoffice this afternoon it was
said that all mail matter east of San
Francisco was 'ate. The 4:45 a, m. train,
one of the fastest in the service, carrying
all the Northwestern mail east of San
Francisco, did not get in until 11 a. m.,
makim? it six hours and forty-five minutes
late. The New York and Dunkirk train on
the Erie, carrying all the New York State
mail, due at 6:30 a. m., had not arrived up
to 3:30 p. m. Most of the other minor
trains carrying mail were also late.
Considerable property was destroyed
along West street in this city, owing to
the flooding of cellars. Large quantities
of perishable produce was stored in the
cellars along: 'his street and : much of it
was destroyed by the water, which, in
many places, was waist deep. In several
of the old-fashioned houses where there
are no cellars the water came above the
flooring and office furniture could be seen
floating around the stores on the ground
floor.

PUTS A BULLET
THROUGH HEART
ETAHTORD DOES NOT
GET A SINGLE SET
California gave Stanford a terrible drub
bing on the California tennis courts Sat
urday in the tenth annual intercollegiate
tennis tournament. It was the most sig
nal victory either college has won since
intercollegiate tennis was started.
\ Several hundred people were on hand to
encourage the collegians ' when play was
called. Both singles events were played
at the same time, but the one between
Harry Wiehe and Paul Selby attracted
the most attention. At the start the for
mer tried to. play the net game, but ho
soon realized that that would not do, as
Selby was passing him continually with
both back and fore hand drives. Selby 1 s
accuracy in placing his â¢ drives was re
markable, and his opponent seemed to
lose confidence very rapidly as the game
progressed. Wiehe, whose forte is vol
leying, was very weak at the net. Selby.
played by far the best game he has ever
put up, but Wiehe was a trifle off in his
play. The complete score in favor of
Selby was 6â2, &â 3, 6â3. . .
While Selby was disposing of Wlehe
Drummoiid McGavin was administering
an equally crushing defeat to William
Roth, Stanford's second man- in singles.
McGavin, who is usually very nervous in
a tournament, was perfectly cool through
out tho match and executed his long,
sweeping drives to perfection. Roth made
a good stand in the second set, pulling it
up from 3â5 to 5â5, only to lose 'in the
end, Sâ 6. McGavin outplayed his oppo
nent at every point of the game, and his
smashing Â¦ was a feature. The score ln
McGavin's favor was 6â1, 8â6, 6â3. :
Henry Wlehe and Dick Adams, the fa
mous pony team, were generally picked to
win the doubles, but the California men
showed that they can play doubles fully
as well as singles. "With the tennis cham
pionship already won the California men
were very confident and took many
chances, while the . Stanford men were
discouraged and played on the defensive
throughout. Adams played a line .game,
but Wlehe was very much disheartened
and did not support his partner as well
as usual. McGavin and Selby played an
aggressive game from start to finish.
Both men drove splendidly from the back
court and up. at the net killed. everything.
The Stanford men resorted to a lobbing
game, which did not prove very effective
against their hard-hitting opponents. The
first set : was very â¢ close, but after that
everything went Berkeley's way and she
won the next two sets rather . easily.
Adams played a very gritty game and
tried hard to stave off defeat, but to no
avail. The score in favor of -Selby and
McGavin, the California men, was 7â5,
&-3, 6-3.
Of the ten intercollegiate tennis tour
naments played each college has won five.

Wu Is a. loval and devoted admirer' of
this country and its institutions, and he
has not been in sympathy with past ef
forts for excessive change, as in his judg
ment they went so far as to invite pre
judice and opposition, not only in im
perial and other ruling quarters, but also
with the mass of the peop" , who are slow
to realize the advantage of sweeping
changes. In the present Instance he has
sought to find a middle ground of con

In determining upon this course. Minis

Initiative and responsibility and without
any preference to hla status aÂ» Minister

It is said, Is the most important act a

o'clock this morning, was wrecked at
Summerland. about six miles south of this
city. The trucks of one of the cars
about the middle of the train left tho

for the purposes of carrying on the bust
ness of the office. There would be no
need of two assistant secretaries with n
knowledge of foreign languages, ns such
officials would be nothing more than in

responsible authority within narrow lim
its, leaving assistants, interpreters, etc.,
to carry on the administrative work. In
other respects the memorial will present
in detail the best features of Western ad
ministration applicable to China. The doc
ument Is practically completed, and soon
will be laid before the Imperial Govern
ment.
One Man Must Reign.
The plan of the powers, as recently made
known in dispatches from Peking, Is that
the old board of ten members shall be
replaced by a new board of five members,
with a Prince of the blood at it9 head, two
Ministers of Foreign Affairs and two Vice
Ministers, the latter to have a knowledge
of foreign languages. This plan has not
been wholly satisfactory to the foreign
Ministers and their Governments, but
they have accepted Jt with the belief that

reform, i In stating the need and ajrere
gate of this the Minister's memorial will
point to the lesson Japan-has given to the
Â¦world. Up to a few years ago the condi
tions In China and Japan were almost
Identical. But by the gradual adoption
of modern methods of procedure Japan
has brought- herself Into close communi
cation with the rest of the world, and
now occupies an enviable position among
the other recognized great powers. Min
ister Wu holds that there Is nothing lack
ing In the resources of China or in the
character of her people to keep her from
securing the same advantages that have
come to Japan. The memorial does not.
however, confine itself to generalization,
but specifies along what lines changes
can be made with advantage. As stated,
these cover administrative, economic and
financial . conditions. In some respects,
also, Mr. Wu's recommendations will take
up lines of reform that have been brought
forward by the powers m the negotiations
at Peking, and will point out that instead
of resisting: them it will be to the ad
vantage of China to go even further than
the powers have suggested. For, Instance,
one of the most important subjects re
cently under consideration has been that
relating to the establishment of & for
eign office at Peking to take the place ot
the Tsung-11 Yamen.

way one man climaxed an Interview. He
would not say there was a vigilance com

appeared to exist a general understanding
that the time had arrived to make a

The Injunction complaint literally ac
cuses the Mount Diablo people of Thurs

is verified by Claflin. It is reported that
the vice president of the Superior Sunset
Company refused to verify it. The other
officers of the company are absent.
The v/arrants for the arrest of the
Mount Diablo people who were in Mid
way the night of the battle have not yet
been issued. It is surmised that they are
waiting till one or both of the wounded
men die so a complaint of a definite na
ture can be made. Claflin said they were
waiting developments; The statement
was made this evening by one of the
Mount Diablo men that proof could be
produced and would be at the proper time
that Walker was shot by his own crowd
and not by the vigilantes.

THE COMING YACHT RACE.
SIR THOMAS LIPTON'S yacht, Shamrock II,
challenger for the America's cup, has been suc
cessfully launched amid. the plaudits of a crowd
that expect her lo be. a winner.. The Countess of Duf
ferin has broken a bottle ofwine over the prow and
the naming has been duly done. The day. was fair,
the workmen of the yard in which the yacht was built
took a holiday. Everything tended to make the occa
sion a joyous one and to fill the British with sanguine
expectations of victory. When Sir Thomas was asked
whether, if beaten, he would try again, he replied: â¢â¢"I
expect next year to build a defender, not a challenger."
While everything is thus harmonious, and -merry
in the camp. of the challengers, there is stuTgoing on
among the defenders a controversy that never should
have arisen. .: It is the now well-worn wrangle over the
question whether right of. defending the cup is open
to all American yachtsmen, or only to those of the
New York Yacht Club. â¢" : ".'
Thomas W. Lawson of Boston, in company with
other New England yachtsmen, has had constructed
a yacht which all loyal New Englanders believe to be
much better than anything the New Yorkers can con
struct. They claim the right to compete with the
yachts of the New Yorkclub, and hold that if success
ful, their boat' shall havp the privilege , of defending
the cup against 'the British" challenger. That right
has been disputed. " The New .York Yacht Club claims
the exclusive right to defend the cup, .and: it appears
it' is in a position to enforce the claim. ,
' It has been suggested that Lawson might arrange
the contest amicably by placing his . boat nominally
in the hands of a. member of the New York club, but
to that suggestion he is reported to have recently
replied: "In' regard to the statements printed that
under certain conditions I would resort to the subter
fuge of allowing some one else, who had no owner
ship in my. boat, to be proclaimed her owner for. the
sake of being allowed to race, I can only say I regret
Â¦there is any one connected with yachting so unmanly
as-to think this possible. No one has ever suggested
such a thing to .me'.- Rather than resort to the methods
suggested to obtain a race I would, regret,
sink the Independence on her launching day."
Thus the matter stood at the time of the latest. report
given to the public of the negotiations. Technically
tfcc New York-Yacht .Club is right, but it is safe to
say'few Americans will approve of such a stand taken
upon a technicality. % It is desirable that the yacht race
becarried out between the best boat, in America and
the, best of any other nation. .-The defense should not
be confined to a^ single club, ; and -.in their efforts-to
force a recognition -of their yacht the. Bosten men
have the sympathy of the country.^ . ;
ART AND H'STORY.
rpvOMANCE has long smceffreed itself-; from the
L_y trammels of histotic accuracy, and consequently
* * when an imaginative writer sits down to con
struct an historical .novel he feels .at; liberty to 'deal
with great personages as he 'cho_oses. He may group
them in whatever way best splits the dramatic require-'
ments of his story, and,; indeed, take /almost Â¦ any
other privilege he desires. That much is conceded;
but has a sculptor the same right as a romancer? Has
an artist who is engaged to design a public monu
ment a privilege to change the facts of history in" or
der to make a striking ] group of illustrious men?
That is a question which is now agitating the East. .
The discussion has arisen over one of the bronze
tablets that adorns the pedestal of the recently un
veiled monument to General Logan at Washington.
It appears that for the sake of surrounding Logan
with some of the most distinguished men of his time
the sculptor has represented him as taking the oath
of office as Senator standing amid a circle of famous
statesmen who were never gathered on any such
occasion. â¢ 'Â¦)
i *The. Chicago Inter, Ocean presents the facts thus:
"This relief represents Vice -President Arthur admin
istering the oath ;to Senator Logan in the presence
Â¦'of Senators Conkling, Cullom, Evarts, Morton, Voor-
r hees, Thurman and Miller of California. General
Logan's first term in the Senate began March 4, 1871,
and ended March 3, 1877. Â¦ He entered upon his sec
ond term March 18, tS/9, during the extra session.
Mr. Arthur first presided over the Senate at the extra
session beginning March 4, 1881, and never admin
istered the oath to Senator Logan. Senator. Cullom
did not enter the Senate until December. 4, 188,3.
Senator Evarts was not. elected until 1885. Senator
Morton died. November , 1, 1877. He probably saw
Logan sworn in in 1871, but the oath was administered
by Vice President Coif ax. Senator Miller was not
elected until January, i88i.' Senators Conkling, Voor
hees and- Thurman were in the Senate when Logan
was sworn 'by Vice President Wheeler, but Thurman
appears not to have been present on that occasion.
Thus it appears that only so much of the scene as rep
resents Logan "taking the, oath, with Conkling and
Voorhees as witnesses, has any historic truth."
It is asserted that the sculptor, Franklin Simmons,
claims that he selected !the\Senators to be" placed- in
the group at the suggestion of Mrs. Logan. . .- That
excuse, however, even if it be : vajid,. would; not affect
the main question of the right of any one to violate
history in the construction' of : an 'historic monument,
1101. has it counted for much with the supporter's of
either side of the controversy.' It is to ~ be; noted,
therefore, merely as .in;."explahatidri: of, the 1 sculptor's
motive, and not as a defense of the act itself.
I All classes of artists must have privileges, sculptors
>as well as noveli^s, but it would seem that in this case,
the privilege has been carried too far. A distinction
should be made between art designed solely for ar
tistic purposes and a work designed mainly for his
toric purposes. A public monument erected for the
object of commemorating a great figure in' the his
tory of the country should be strictly true to history
or else frankly ideal and symbolical. There can be no
objection to David's great picture of Napoleon
. crossing the Alps on a fiery warhorse, because every
I one who sees the picture perceives at once the essen-
I tinl idealism of the hero as there presented; but
.when called upon to paint the coronation of Napo
[leon David Had to deal with an historic event, and
In a recent address Senator- Platt of Connecticut
stated that since the close of the war over 40,000 per
sons hare'emigrated from Spain or. the Canary Islands
to Cuba, so it is evident the Spanish people do not
believe American interference has injured Cuba's pros
pects to any great extent.
The story that San Francisco has not enough hovel
room to furnish lodging for a guest who comes lats,
is a good story in its >vÂ£.y, but all* the same no one
need stay away from thecityj'on that account. When
the crowds come here to greet the President Sp.n
Francisco hospitality' will find a means of providing
them vvith all "sorts of accommodations. .
THE BOOM IN WALL STREET.
AS far as figures go last week was almost a record
breaker in trade. Certainly an enormous
amount of money changed hands in business.
Ihe clearings of the .country, showed the remarkable
increase of 76.6 per cent over last year, the. gain at
New York being 100.8 per cent, at Boston 73.4 per
c*nt and af Pittsburg 56.3 per cent. Every important
ciiv in the country showed a gain.
All this is brilliant, and to the general observer in
dicates intense activity in business throughout the
United States. But to the shrewd and posted financier,
vho keeps close to the center of affairs and knows
what is going on, the glittering figures wear another
aspect. It is this: The major part of this great gain
in the bank clearings and apparent volume of trade
is confined to the thre; cities mentioned above. In
other words the great steel and railroad trusts are
causing most of the commotion, chiefly in Wall street.
The gain in business as represented by the clearings,
is speculative rather than real, on paper rather than
consumptive. New Yoik and Boston are the cities
wncre the coin is kept and where all the big schemes
are financed, and Pittsburg is the city where the steel
works are. To . be still more explicit, the immense
steel corporation, lately formed with a capitalization
of over $1,000,000,006, and which is the biggest thing
hi its line that the world has even seen,' has started
into motion gigantic wheels which are now revolving
over an enormous area and making everything around
them dizzy. If the stsei corporation -were eliminated
from the commercial proposition it would be seen
that while the country is prosperous, with its treasury
full of gold and a good condition of trade everywhere,
it is not really making the gain in general trade repre
sented by that 76.6 per cent for the country and that
100.8 per cent at New York. â¢
As for Wall street, it was a wild place last Friday.
Ail previous stock market records were broken, and
the recorded sales amounted to over 2,220,000 shares,
to say nothing of the ether thousands of shares sold
en the outside. Enormous holdings changed hands
in single blocks, and if there" were any bears in Wall
street they were in their holes or covering at rising
prices. . .
The old heads in Will street are wondering when
all this going to stop, and how. For that matter,
they have been wondering for a year or more. Most
c! them expected that it would come to an end long
before this, but there seems to be as much steam as
ever. /
As hinted above, general trade does not exhibit
any particular steam. Cold, snowy and rainy weather
has interfered with the distributive trade in the West
and Noithwest, and checked a good deal of cotton
planting in the South, as shown by the cancellation
oi large orders for fertilizers used in the cotton fielJs.
The Georgia mills are running time, but many
other mills have made material reductions. Wool con
tinues dull, but the feeling is steady. The large manu
facturers are not doing much, but the small ones are.
buying moderately. The shipments of boots and
shoes from Eastern points are steadily falling off.
though they are still ahead of those a year ago. Hides
ere reported firmer at Chicago, but leather is weaker
and boots are lower. Piovisions have not been as
firm, though hogs are still scarce. Against these
wlher unfavorable signs, however, we have increased
railroad earnings, showing a large movement in gen
cia! merchandise, a large distribution of spring and
summer goods, easy collections and an enormous
amount of gold in the national treasury. As for crop
conditions, they are i^niarkably favorable. But the
iron and steel trade continues to lead everything else
in sight. Immense quantities are wanted for bridges,
buildings and farming implements, and plans are be
ing drawn for new mills of enormous capacity.
This is the commercial situation throughout the
country at large. In our local market there is noth
ing new to report, con Jition^ remaining about as t'cv
have been given for several months. Our local .crop
prospects are satisfactory, and while the country over
the other side of the Rockies continues to flourish we
are all right.

Novelists Are Numerous.
JUtogether there are at least fifty novel
ists of some pretensions in Japan, and
most of them find subsistence by writing
serials for the newspapers and turning
out, as from a mill, humorous or sensa
tional paragraphs. Only two or three out
of all these can earn enough money to
keep themselves respectable. Oxakl Koyo,
already mentioned, and one of the most
prominent of the group, was born in ISto.
and. after spending three years in the
Tokio Imperial University, entered on his
career in literature. He is a combination
of Zola and Henry James, though far in
ferior to f lther. He is praised for his del
icate touch and graceful style; and has a
predilection for delineating the sunny side
of life. He has a. theoryâ sarcastic per
sons say that It's not an unselfish theoryâ
that state aid should be given to' authors,
and defends that theory with a warmth
that has lately called forth indignant re
plies from various quarters. On being told
once that Zola had spent a whole week in
studying character in tram cars, he was
filled with envy. "Happy," he exclaimed,
"is the author, who is so little pressed by
the production of moneymaking books aa
to be able to devote so much time to
trifling affairs like that." His principal
works are "Three Wives." "Dimples on
the Cheek." "Pillow of Incense Wood.''
'Love Sick" and "Darkness of Heart.'
Their names vividly suggest the subjects
with which they all deal. ~ '
" Koda Roban is of about the same age as
Koyo and was once a clerk in a telegraph
office. He was regarded In his youth as
the blockhead of the family. This block
head is now regarded by the Japanese a3
their Meredith. Hid works are esthetic
and are celebrated . for their wondrous
nights of imagination, but his style Is fre
quently abrupt and incomprehensible to
ordinary readers. He Is.- in fact, like
Meredith and Jamesâ a writer for the cul
tured, his audience being select, if few.
and . most of his works . treat of some
master" artisf entirely "absorbed tn his
work and alike Indifferent to the doings
and -the; opinions of the- busy outside
world."- Â¦â¢â¢ Â¦Â¦ -â¢ Â¦'"-Â¦Â¦
The Rqban. family Is a remarkable one.
Robanf s two sisters have been sent by the
Government to Berlin and Vienna to study
violin playing, at which one of them is
already vÂ«ry proficient; and his brother.
Lieutenant Gungi. Is the originator of &
bold scheme for settling Japanese in the
Kurile group, and evidently a man af
flicted with much of the restlessness and
originality of genius. Roban has not pro
duced, so many works as Koyo, chief
among them being 'A Five-Storied Pa
goda," "A Blade" aiÂ»d "A Refined Budd
hist."
A Japanese Thomas Hardy.
Hirotsu Ryuro, another of the con
temporary novelists of Japan, is four or
five years older than either of the two
preceding writers, and Is regarded by
the Japanese as their. Thomas Hardy. He
is fond of tragedies In common life, and
his peasant characters, as well as his
plots, are regarded in this country with
great admiration. He Is even more oro-
Jiflc4han JCoyo,, and^possesaes jnore of a
business spirit than most of Tils con
freres â a fact due, perhaps, to the circum
stance that he was once a petty official in
the Government service. His "Love-Sui
cide at Imado," in which a de
graded woman dies with a man
whom she does not love. Is 'famous
for the masterly way in which he
traces the gradual development of his
characters. Another famous work of his
is "The Tragedy of Kawachlya." in which
a virtuous wife Dines away and dies on
account of her husband's infatuation for
a tea-house woman, who is not in love
with him. however, but with his brother.
The brother's rejection of the woman's
advances awakens such fury In the breast
of the rejected one that the death of both
brothers is the outcome. Ryuro is not re
markable for his style, however, which is
inferior to that of the other two writers.
Surgeon General Mori Oliga Is a wntet
noted for his translations of several Ger
man works, and also for his original
short stories, .which are declared by all
Japanese to be excellent in style and con
ception. Another author, who is also
known as a translator, is Professor Hase
gama Shimel, a teacher In the Tokio For
eign Language School, and the only Jap
anese scholar who can he said tp be well
versed in Russian literature. He has
translated several of Tolstoi's and Tur
genieff's novels, and has produced two or
three original novels. His highly col
loquial style has done much : for the
simplification of the national written lan
guage.
Among other conspicuous novelists
should be mentioned Iwaya Sazanaml.
now a teacher of Japanese in the Berlin
Foreign Language School. He .Is the
only Japanese author, who has conde
scended to write stories for juvenile read
ers. Besides his adaptations from Lewis
Carroll and Grim, he has himself written
several popular children's stories.
Most Popular Japanese Author.
; Mural Gensai Is the most popular na
tive author in Japan â not. because- of hia
genius, however, but because of his busi
ness ability. In fact, he is a strictly "cash
author." His most popular work, "Ris
ing Sun Island," has been runnlnsr for
over three years in a daily paper. Its
chief merit in the eyes of the Japanese
is that it is strictly pure, clearly refers
to current affairs, and "Is tinctured with
general scientific facts made intelligible
to women." But the vast story, which
is of Interminable length, is simolv a
series of stories, loosely strung together.
It contains no character sketches worthy
of the name, no plot and no humorâ yet
20.000 copies of the first part of it have re
cantly.been sold, the sale being a record
one for Japan. This great success is
probably due to the fact that the com
parative purity of the story permits its
Introduction among women and families.
The story Is still running Its course In
the newspaper, and according to all ap
pearances may be running ten years
hence.
Note â This paper will be concluded next
Monday. ,
THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT.
SOMETHING like a mariia-for legislation on the
subject of matrimony has'possessed the legis
lators of the East during the past" winter. â¢ The
Call has repeatedly directed attention to variousbill^
designed to. encourage marriage by one means ; or
another, and it has now to refer to one 'designed tc
retard it a little; or at least to put an end-to one of
the forms in which it has been practiced or cmalprac
ticed to the injury of the community at large. â¢Â¦'- "^ .
California has had many notorious scandals and
several great lawsuits resulting from the ease with
which contract marriages can be effected under the
existing law. In New York, however, the situation
has been much* worse than in this State, for the popu
lation being larger the number of evils resulting from
lax marriage laws has Been proportionally greater.
Again and again the death of a rich man in that State
has been followed by the appearance of woman claim
ing to have been his wife by. a contract antedating his
public wedding to another. Wills have been contested
and estates wasted in prolonged lawsuits â¢ over such
claims, and not infrequently innocent women have had
to suffer the imputation of unlawful union with men
to. whom they ; were publicly wedded, and upon their
children has been fixed the. taint of illegitimacy. So
great have been the evils resulting from such cases
that families affected by them have sought to settle
them out of court at almost any cost, 1 and as a;conse :
quence the contract marriage has proven to be .a fruit
ful source of blackmail. V'^t;
For the purpose of putting an end to the frauds, and
affording protection to innocent women, the New. York
Legislature has adopted a law, to take effect January
i, which provides that no common law marriage con
tracted in the State on or after that date shall be valid
unless erttered into through a written contract of mar
riage signed by both parties and at least two witnesses,
who* shall subscribe to the same, stating the place of
residence of each" of the parties and witnesses, and
the place and date of marriage. The contract must
be acknowledged by the parties and witnesses. in the
same manner as a conveyance "of real estate, to enable
it to be recorded, and within six months after its exe
cution it must be filed in the office. of the clerk of the
town or city in which the marriage occurs. â¢
The new act changes what might be called a part
of the fundamental law of the State, for what are called
"common law marriages" have been recognized in
New York from; time immemorial. It is said by its
advocates to be the nios* important reform measure
passed by, the Legislature for many years' and is the
outcome of a prolonged agitation. It appears to merit
general approval, for it will n'pt only be a safeguard
for property .transmitted .by inheritance, but also a
protection for women, inasmuch as it is to their inter
est that the -fact oÂ£ la\yful .'marriage, should, be, always
certain and capable of proof./ ... *';
which yawns between East and West and
which is nowhere wider than in x literary
matters. I may add that if low living on
rice and fish, bathing in hot waterseveral
times a day and sitting spotlessly clean
on Immaculate ' mats reduces men to tne
condition of the novelists who allow them
selves to be trampled on like this, then i
am for dust, exercise, roast beef and beer.
What has really brought about this con
dition would be difficult to say. It may De
that the ; long isolation of the Japanese
and their subjection to the deadening in
fluence of China have made it difficult for
them to create all at once a noble litera
ture, but in process of time that literature
will come. On the other hand, it is as
serted that there must be some original
sin of weakness as well. Otherwise, as a
recent writer has noted, "the clash of
India and China with old mythological
Japan, of Buddhism with Shinto, of im
perialism with feudalism and of all with
Catholicism in the sixteenth century and
with Dutch ideas a little later, would have
produced more important results."
"Work of Translators.
Those who take this view should bear
in mind, however, that a nation cannot do
everything at once. A race may, indeed,
change its habits and customs and its na
tional policy rapidly, but It cannot so
quickly alter its cast of mind. If any ex
cuse can be offered for their pessimism it
lies in the apparent inability of many
highly educated Japanese to see through
European spectacles in matters of literary
taste. They get European books by trans
lationâand such translation! A Japanese
version of Bulwer Lytton'a "Ernest Mal
travers," which appeared in 1&79 under the
title of "A Spring Story of Flowers and
Willows," was the first European novel to
be translated, and it has been followed by
a torrent which never rushed more rap
idly than at the present moment. The
Japanese novelist â or translator I should,
perhaps, sayâ labors under the great dis
advantage of writing in a most difficult
and recondite system of symbols, which
has been compared, not without reason, to
much-abbreviated Latin telegrams. He
writes for a public, too, w-hlch cannot tell
when he is translating and when he is
original, and the result is that he borrows
plots wholesale from English and Amer
ican writers, merely Japanizlng the names
and altering the details to suit Japanese
social conditions. By this means he makes
a little money and becomes celebrated for
his fertility of invention, but ruins him
self irretrievably as an artist, if there
ever was the making of an artist in him.
It is only among the ignorant that he i3
celebrated; the educated Japanese hold
him In contempt and never read him.
Some Japanese Successes.
It may be regarded as a sign of the ex
tent of the translation folly that the hero
of the most popular Japanese work of fic
tion that has appeared during the present
reign isâ Epaminondas! This work, en
titled "Keikoku Bidan," takes the field of
Theban politics for its subject matter. Ihe
allusions were simply transferred withaut
much difficulty to modern Japanese poll-,
tics. Another successful novel, Kajln
no Kigu," has its opening scene laid in
the Capitol at Washington, where one of
the characters, a Japanese, reads aloud
to his companions the Declaration of In
dependence. Carlist pretenders, English
soldiers and other Europeans all appear
in the pages of this work,, which, by a
curious contradiction, is written in the
most classical Chinese style. An able
Japanese critic relates that- in 1895, "while
Japan was busy beating China, and had
convinced herself that she could. beat the
world, one of the Tokio papers, achieved
a success by the publication â¢ of a serltth
novel entitled 'Asahi Zakura.' The hero
ines of this book were two Red Cross
nurses, and the story that of the coming
defeat of England by Japan, which, after
annexing Hongkong, India, Malta and
Gibraltar, sends its fleet up the Thames
to raze the fortressess there and to ex
act from the cowering Britishers an
enormous indemnity."
One of Japan's Leading Novelists.
Novels of this class, of course, are not
fairly representative, although it is doubt
ful whether the European reader would
find satisfaction in many Japanese books
of distinctly better grade. Take, for ex
ample, "Tajyo Takon" ("Fears and Re
grets"), by Ozaki Koyo. one of the best
known of living Japanese novelists. The
central figure in this work is one Mr.
Sumi, "a graduate of the elective course
of geology" In the Tokio Imperial Univer
sity, who is earning a trifling wage as
teacher of ajcertain school of physics and
mathematics*. We find this man, when we
make his acquaintance, plunged In unut
terable grief on account of the loss of his
wife. Sumi weeps and groans, In fact, all
the way through the book, which contains
500 pages. There is a mother-in-law in
the book, Sumi's mother-in-law; this good
lady forces her second daughter to go and
live against her will with the dolorous
Sumi, whose household consists only of
himself and an old' female servant. The
heart-broken husband receives the girl.
T)Ut after some time sends a letter to the
Intriguing mother-in-law asking her to
take her daughter away. Now, Sumi has
a married friend called Hayama, but he
hates Mrs. Hayama â and the hatred is
returned, for the good woman' despises a
man who goes about shedding floods of
tears. The mutual dislike soon wears
away, however, on Sumi's taking lodging
in Hayama's attic, and each comes to es
teem the other, until "one rainy night the
recollection of his wife came too vividly
upen Sumi to be borne without Mrs. Hay
ama's soothing words and sympathetic
countenance" and he calmly proceeds to
make love to her. Hayama Is finally un
der the necessity of turning the tearful
lover out of doors. . -
One paragraph in the book, however,
may serve to give a hint of Japanese cyn
ical humor In fiction. Hayama, explain
ing why his friends fall off when he mar
ries, says:
Tou know, my : dear fellow, every married
woman secretly keeps a notebook. Neither her
husband nor her mother knows of its existence,
but it exists, all the same. It is called the
"Kltto O boye-cho" (book for keeping: things
well in the memory). She puts down in that
book, you see. the names of the Jolly old
bachelors who take her husband out; of the

- As for the average novelist, he does not
seem to be so much respected and looked
up to as is the novelist in America or in
Europe. This is partly owing, no doubt,
to his poverty.. The average author sells
only about 2000 copies of any work; the
price of books must be low (less than 12
American cents, on an average), and there
are not ten authors in Japan who get
over twenty-five -gold dollars a month
from their works. . There Is a Mr. Myeda
here, the Director of the Bureau of Spe
cial Studies in the Educational Depart
ment, who on a certain occasion every
year hurls denunciations in the most
amusing manner and in almost exactly
the same -words at the unfortunate ro
mancers. About a year ago he told them
to come out into the open air and mix
with society, assuring them that if they
persisted In remaining at home like her
mits they could not expect to become suc
cessful-writers. He concluded by seri
ously imploring the authorities to give
the novelists facilities to see life by send
ing them Invitations to balls, banquets
and ofllcial "spreads." Strange to say
nobody saw anything out of the common
in this speech, which was delivered with
the utmost seriousness. Japan read it in.

a. smile did it elicit. The readers only
wagged their heads and remarked that it

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Lot of the Japanese Novelist.
Even the globe-trotter- can see, however,
without making any investigation what
ever that the people read much. School
boys are constantly â¢: . found with paper
backed novels adorned on the cover with
a rude picturevrepresenting a Samurai
cutting someboc" r down; servant girls in
the teahouses devour; rather- highly spicea
"shotsetsu" ; in\ their scanty intervals of
leisure. I earned the undying gratitude
of one only yesterday by asking her to
continue reading in iny presence a love
story which Â¦ T, noticed in her hanging
sleeve while she was -bringing up my tif
fin. More remarkable still, that human
horse, â¢ the jinrikisha-man, has no sooner
set you down at your destination and
coiled himself up between the shafts to
await your return than he produces from
under the cane-bottomed seat orhis gro
tesque vehicle a ponderous tome that looks
like the work, of a Japanese Gibbon, but
is really only one of the many volumes in
which some popular, story-teller describes
the adventures of a favorite hero. â¢ Â¦
It should not be assumed from all this,
however, that the subjects of the Mikado
are all shining .examples of culture. Not
onlv are many of the books J generally
read distinctly bad in. character, but
s-trange as it may seem, eight readers out
of every tenpatronize verbatim shorthand
reports of professional story-tellers and
are therefore obviously dead to the sense
of literary felicity and artistic style.
Among the boys "detective" stories are
especially popular. Â¦ . ;" Â¦'Â¦"- " ;> .
Next in popularity to novels come tech
nical works, and of these medical books
nave the largest sale Of foreign works,
those in English head the list, six Eng
lish books being sold for every two in
German or French. Russian books have a
much smaller sale. The , sales of the
largest book store in the city do not ex
ceed 2500 yenâ less than $12oOâ a month,
but on account of the comparative pov
erty of the people and other reasons I
have given above, the number of readers
in the city must not be estimated from
these scanty figures.
Penny Dreadfuls inJapan.
In considering these writers the Occi
dental reader, must bear in i mind the pe
culiar conditions in which literature is pro
duced in Japan, the standing of the aver
age man of letters there and the taste of
the public to which he appeals. Take, as
an example, the public^ of Osaka, a thriv
ing city of 800,000 inhabitants, which in
some respects may be compared to such
an American city, say, as Chicago. There
are 'more works of fiction sold in Osaka
than of any other kind. It is estimated
that the sale of novels is 3509 a month, but
as this number does not include the vol
umes supplied by the circulatinglibraries,
which are said to' lend 'five times that
number of novels, it is safe to put the
demand for fiction in Osaka roughly at
20,000 volumes a month. This does not
seem to indicate a widespread taste for
reading, but when we take into considera
tion the fact that the Japanese are more
gregarious than Americans; that a dozen
Of .them will sleep in the same room as a,
matter of course where Europeans would
demand separate apartments, and that
there is no such thing as privacy in
Japan, it is safe to assume that one copy
Of a bookâ books, too,, are generally kept
cleaner in Japan than' elsewhereâ may"
pass through- the-hands of a hundred read
ers. Judging by the vast number of sec
ond-hand book stores all over the country
I should think, indeed, that single copies
of books go through more hands in Japan
than elsewhere and that .. the Japanese of
the lower class are astonishingly vora
cious : readers.. -Many of Fukuzana a
works, published immediately after the
Restoration, ran into half a million copies,
while of the late Mr. Nakamura's transla
tion of Smiles' "Self. Help" at least 300,000
copies must have been sold..;.,- ,
Owing to the energy and zeal with which
the entire nation has devoted itself in re
cent years to'trie' acquisition of the purely
material elements of Western civilization
modern Japan has impressed the Â¦world
rather by the increase of' its 'armaments
and the extension of its trade, than by ita
literature. Its surprising, material devel
opment, in fact, has obscured its growth
in other directions.- The leading Japanese
writers. oÂ£ to-day are almost unknown in
Europe and. America, yet these writers
comprise avconslderable and influential
body, and constitute a force that must
play a large ,part in determining Japan's
destiny. . ; ,' .

AMONG the many conferences that are to be held
in connection with the Buffalo exposition,
.hardly any. promises to result in more direct
benefit to the nation than that which has been called
to take" into consideration the various taxation prob
lems of the time in this country. The problems have
been felt through the defects of the present systems
of taxation iri every State in the Union, and in. many
of them serious efforts have been made to devise reme
dies and^to provide for a more just and economical
way of collecting . from taxpayers the revenues re
quire'd for governmental purposes. '
The circular announcing the calling of the confer
ence and its purposes says: "For many- decades the
States have been, building up independent systems of
taxation, without reference to each other, until
now we have, a state of affairs .bordering on
chaos, where - each State is practically fighting
nearly. every.other State. Some property, is taxed three
or four times, while ether property is not taxed at
Tall.- Corporate activity has largely changed the char
acter of individual investments. Industry has over
stepped the boundaries cf any one State, and commer
cial'interests'are no longer confined to mere local
limits. This, conference will be the first attempt in
this country to work out some uniform principles." .
The statement that the conference "will be. the first
attempt in this country to work out some uniform prin
ciples" must have been intended to mean the first
attempt to bring about a uniform system of taxation
among the various States, for there have been many
efforts to find uniform principles of taxation generally.
At the present time the Industrial Commission is en
gaged in that very work, and has recently made public
a report upon the general property tax and the taxa
tion of corporations in several of the most important
States of the Union extending from Massachusetts to
Texas.
From a summary of the report sent out from Wash
ington it appears that in no State whose system of
taxation has been reviewed is the general property
tax satisfactory. The report says: "It is clear that
under this system there are numerous forms of wealth
that do not and cannot.be made to bear a just-share
of the public burdens, and which in a large part evade
or escape taxation, and some forms which when
reached at all under the prevailing general property
tax are not equally and uniformly but unjustly and
disproportionately taxed as: compared with other
property. The. inevitable result is that real estate and
some forms of personalty are unduly burdened with
taxation."- :â¢-..'
It is, of. course, not to be expected that:the Buffalo
conference, will itself Â«,olve any of the problems,in
volved in our confused systems of State taxation. It
may,- however, have the effect of bringing about the
appointment of something in the nature of an inter
state commission' to dealwith the complexities of the
subject. An \ absolutely uniform; system of taxation
among all the States is not to be looked for nor is 'it
desirable,. but enough might be accomplished to put
an -end to the trick by. which many corporations escape
taxation by. having their nominal headquarters in one
State, -doing business in several others" and shirking
taxes in all.

John Walsh of 243 Pacific street was
treated at the Karbcr .Hospital for gas
asphyxiation yesterday. He - says two
men entered his room and opened four of
the burners. He did not suffer very much
from the effects of the monoxide.
Sullivan said he had been visiting a
friend in the Mission and was on his way
lo his lodgings on Ellis street when two
men armed with revolvers suddenly con
fronted him and commanded him to throw
up his hands.
Realizing that they meant business, Sul
livan quickly obeyed the command. One
of the men then went through his pock
ets, securing his money and papers.. The
desperate pair then ordered their victim
to "move -on" under penalty of being
made a subject for the Coroner.
Sullivan lost no time in leaving the vi
cinity. The description of the robbers
tallies exactly with that given of the men
who held up a sailor on Howard street a
short time ago. The seafaring man was
walking along the street when he was
suddenly confronted bv two masked men,
who. after covering him with pistols, or
dered him to throw up his hands. Upon
his refusal to do so one of the robbers
shot him in the breast, inflicting a dan
gerous wound.
Edward Sullivan, an ex-soldier, reported
to the police yesterday that he had been
held up by two men on Eleventh street,
near Bryant, Saturday night, and robbed
of $100 and some valuable papers.

A squall struck the schooner and when
she heeled over the water rushed in and
turned her over. The coal all went back
to the bottom of the bav and the Lorenz

THE dismasted German bark "Willy
Rickmers put into port yesterday
in distress. She -was caught in a
typhoon on March 5 and at 10 a.
m. the foretopmast, with every
thing attached, went by the boards. The
main and mlzzen topmasts soon followed
the foretopmast and then all hands had to
set to work cutting adrift the wreckage.
Owing to the heayv cross sea this was -a
particularly dangerous operation, but It
was finally accomplished without any
further mishap. . *
When the vessel was got under a jury
rig she labored heavily and in order to
save her more than 200 tons of the ballast
was jettisoned. This lightened her up
considerably and not only lessened the
strain but the bark sailed better. From
the time of the disaster until port was
reached the Rickmers averaged â¢ sixty
knots a day. the best run being 136 knots
in the twenty-four hours.
"We sailed from Hiogo, Japan, on Feb
ruary 23 last in ballast," said Captain J..
Baneke yesterday. "All went well for ten
days and then trie glass fell rapidly, so
the bark was put under snug- canvas. At
9 a. m. on March 5 it was blowing a-hur
ricane, with a very heavy cross sea. The
ship labored frightfully and every min
_ute I expected to see ; the masts roll out
of her. About 10 a. m. a heavy squall
struck the ship and the foretopmast with
everything attached went by the board.
The jet boom was sprung at the time and
one of the lifeboats smashed.
"The gale now increased in fury and
the v/ind shifted to every point of the
compass. First it came from the east and
an hour later was from the east-south
west, only to change to southwest and
then to west. The ship now began to roll
with sudden jerks and, the back stays
parting, the main topmast came down",
the mizzen topmasts with it. Some of the
yards and spars fell to port and some to
starboard, and as they came crashing
against the sides it looked at times as if
a hole would be punched in the hull. All
hands went to work and by 4 p. m. we had
ali the wreckage cut away. ,
"The yards that were left on the stumps
of the masts had nothing to hold them in
position and they went chopping around
! like the sails of a windmill. It was a
; dangerous operation to make them fast,
' but it was finally accomplished and -sve
got a little sail set. We had a rest for
the next forty-eight hours and then it
came on to blow again. A- big sea swept
; over the forecastle head and Cornelius do
, boer was carried overboard. He was' a
I good nvlmmer and as he fell to leeward
the chances were in his favor. The ship
I drifted right over him and when the poor
I fellow came ud to windward he seemed
! to have been injured, as he was swimming
Â¦ -with one arm only. "We threw him ropes
and lifebuoys but the wind drove them
back against the side of the ship and noth
' ing reached him. The unfortunate fellow
was only fifteen or twenty feet away from
the ship but, owing to the mountainous
sea and the strength of the wind, "we
could not lower a boat. De Doer was a
native of Holland and 24 years of age.
"After the second gale died out we had
nothing but fair weather to port and came
I along under our jury canvas at the rate
i of sixty knots a day. We were wrecked
in latitude 42 degree3 north, longitude 172
degrees east, and on March 29, in latitude
35 degrees north, longtitude 155 decrees
west, a four-masted schooner, the Rosa
mond, hove in sight. She passed about six
miles, to windward of us and could easily
have stood down, but the captain passed
us by as though there was nothing the
matter with us. On April 11. in latitude 38
degrees 10 minutes north, longitude 133 de
grees 50 minutes west, the J. C. Efluger
spoke us and the captain, I hear, reported
us all well. We are chartered to load
wheat at Portland, but I suppose that will
have to be abandoned. Until I hear from
the owners I do not know what will be
done with the vessel."

Dissasrs and
Weakness of
MEN ONLY
By far the most frequent cause of nervous
disorders of the male Is
A DAMAGED PROSTATE GLAND.
Thfl Prostats Gland (eo-caHed neck of blad-
der) is a structure very rich in nerves. When
the terminations of these nerves are kept in a
constant state of excitement, by chrqnlc Inflam-
matory processes, it appears very dear that by
transmission of this irritation to other nerves
thÂ« patient may be subject to nervous phenom-
ena of the most varied character. Premature-
ness, Impotency, etc.. arÂ« not weaknesses, but
symptoms of this Inflammation. WÂ« have pre-
pared a' colored chart, which we will send, fres
on application, by which any one Interested can
readily understand why. if he has been treated
for a weakness, he has not been cured. We
particularly solicit this class of cases, and can
promise a speedy cure without stomach drug-
ging-.

tlve they -will agree with me that it is the
best toilet soap ever made. I wish to em-
phasize the statement I have so often
made, that SOAP IS A MEDICINE. That
more or less of the ingredients get into the
system through the pores, and that the
blood carries these Ingredients to every
part of the body. Soap either benefits or
injures the human system. Therefore all
soaps made from common fats and dan-
gerous alkalies should be avoided. My
"Witch Hazel Soap Is absolutely pure
enough to eat. It is a skin food and Vital-
Izer, and is superior to any French toilet
soap ever' placed upon the market. To all
persons -who are afflicted with pimples,
eruptions, liver spots or facial blemishes,
or who have a sallow complexion. I most
strongly advise taking my Liver Cure
and my Blocd Cure in alternation until
the blood is thoroughly purified and the
liver is put into a healthy condition.
These little pellets are pleasant to take,
can be carried in the vest pocket and cost
but 25 cents a vial. If these two remedies
are used in conjunction with my "Witch
Hazel Soap, you will be surprised at the
transformation of your skin and complex-
ion., In order that my soap may have a
universal sale I have authorized drug-
gists to sell the regular 23-cent size for IS
cents. If you need medical advice write

The double event offered as an attrac

brought out a large crowd of enthusiasts
yesterday and the card resulted in a good
day's sport.
â¢In the Reserve stake of 112 entries. Har
lean Gladys, F. Jones' clever performer,
took first honors from P. J. Reilly's hard
working courser. Royal Union.
The deciding course in the "contest of
ohampions was between Eugene Geary's
Palo Alto, the winner of many stakes, and
D. J. Healey's Sisquoc, recently always in,
the money, and was won. by the former.
Beacon, after getting a victory from
Santonin in the run-down, went out to
Ireland in his next go. This was indeed
a setback to the knowing ones. Curtis'
blue dog, it was figured, wa3 to play nip
and tuck, in and out with Palo Alto in
the third round. Tne steady patreXns of
the sport were preparing tor the ariitici
pated excitement or sucn a meetingHand
any old price was good enough that Bea
con could outpoint Ireland, Palo Alto's
brother. Six to one was the ruling odds,
and a heavy play went on. Ireland was
favored for the turn, and when the course
was at an end had a point the better of
his hish. class opponent.
When Palo Aiti> and. Sisquoc came to
â¢gether for first honors Alto led and took
the turn. Sisquoc, ciose at hand, got the
kill. In the run-oti there was but one doc
In the race, and it was not Sisquoc
Geary's hound denied his opponent a point
in the score. Sisquoc had iriends galore,
and at one time was a slight favorite la
the betting.
Harlean Gladys led everything she met.
In the final she took first and second turn
and Royal Union killed. The runner-up
made the smart ones tear up their tickets
after his argument with For Glory, a I to
1 favorite.
McComb's Firm Fellow made a finÂ©
showing, reaching fourth money. He had
a hard time beating Ever Sure, but fol
lowed by getting the decision from Dew
drcp, a 2 to 1- favorite. He was witb>
drawn aeainst Royal Union.

BLUE ROCKS. .
The shooting at the live-bird traps was
merely practice and secondary in import
ance to the bluerock. Phil Bekeart of
the San Francisco Gun Club annexed the
principal share of the honors by shoot
ing several clean scores.
The scores at the Hve-bird traps were:
Others .whose marksmanship merited
silver decoration were E. Klevesahl, C.'
A. Halght, F. Feudner (2), W. J. Golcher,
A. M. Shields, C. W. Debenham and J.
Ross of Antioch, who shot as the guest
of the club.
Otto Feudner carried off the honors of
the occasion by accomplishing fifty-four
straight killsâ a record which has not
been eaualed for many a day. Besides
this, he secured first prize in the mer
chandise contest and also two silver bars
with which to decorate his person.
The Olympic Club's offer to award gold
and silver bars to those who would suc
ceed during the open shoot at Ingleside
yesterday in breaking a certain number
of consecutive bluerocks brought , the
largest crowd of marksmen of the sea
son to the traps. Guns boomed continu
ally from morning to night. Over, 8000 of
the inanimate birds were shattered dur
ing the day, .which is the largest amount
by far . ever broken outside of a State
shoot. Both the live-bird traps and the
bluerock were liberally patronized. The
rewards offered by the club proved an
excellent Incentive, and as a result record
breaking scores Â¦were made.

Many Bluerocks Are Shattered and Pigeons
Killed at the Ingleside Grounds.
ONE of the most successful enter
tainments ever given by the Cor
inthian Yacht Club took place on
Saturday in the clubhouse at Tib
uron. During the afternoon a re
ception was given to ladies, but after 6
p. m. the yachtsmen had the whole field
to themselves. The evening jinks took
the form of a minstrel show, In which
many old favorites took part.
Colors were made yesterday morning at
8 o'clock, and at 10 owners reported on
beard the flagship May. Shortly after 11
the fleet made sail, but the wind was so
light that for some time no progress was
made. Finding it too hard work to buck
the tide. Commodore Hawks led the way
up Raccoon Straits and to the north of
Angel Island. After passing Point Blunt
a gbod breeze was encountered, and the
fleet cruised for some distance along the
city front, then toward Sausalito and so
back to .the moorings. The only mishap
that occurred befell Frank A. Bartlett's
yawl Spray, which was under sail for the
first time since extensive alterations have
been made in her. While near the Ger
man ship Otto Gildermeister the jib car
ried away at its forward end, but was
soon repaired and the cruise resumed.
Among the yachts* following Commodore
H. D. Hawks' flagship May were the fol
lowing: J. M. Mattoon's sloop Amigo, A.
I. Lyons* sloop Freda, Dr. A. W. McKen
zie's sloop Sappho, P. W. Hurndall's sloop
Merope, Frank A. Bartlett's yawl Spray,
J. Wagner's yawl Nereid. J. Mooney's
sloop Belle, R H. Morrow's sloop
Rover, Vice Commodore E. F. Sa
gar's sloop Edna, J. W. Pew's sloop Tru
ant, A. Y. Young and T. Ransom's sloop
Clara, Jennings and Johns' sloop Speed
v/ell, Carl Westerfeld's sloop Aeolus,
Frank Stone's sloop Presto, "W. H.
Toepke's sloop Harpoon, Short brothers*
sloop Emma, Brickell and Bowes' slop
Genesta, J. A. Breitzmann's sloop Cupid,
Frank Baker's sloop Emilie, Andrew
Thome's yawl Seven Bells and Boyle and
Bulger's sloop Ariel. The fleet was ac
companied by the following . visiting
yachts: Commodore W. N. McCarthy's
schooner Ramona, Commodore S. S. Mar
shall's sloop Thelma, Allen M. Clay's
sloop Pactolus, J. T. Carrier's sloop Jessie
E, J. D. Spreckels' schooner Lurline,
Charles Stewart's sloop. Beatrice, D.
Dean's sloop Nellie, G. E. Billings' sloop
Nixie and the sloop Fawn. The yachts
Caprice, Vega and Discovery were also
under way. Commodore W. J. "Woods of
the sloop Angela came down from Vallejo
on Saturday to attend the jinks. Only two
Corinthian yachts now remain in the la
goon â W. S. Grover's yawl Arcturus and
the-sloop Phoenicia. A few'yachts are not
yet in commission, but will be made ready
as quickly as possible. Everything points
to a successful and pleasant yachting sea
son.

Another event of the morning game was
the presentation of a dozen bats to the
Oakland team. They were donated by the
management of the Dewey Theater,
which, in the enthusiasm of its joy over
the first appearance of the home team on
the home, grounds in the present season,
thought a few pennant-winning imple
ments would not be out of order. The bats
were accepted gracefully and with much
gratitude, and then the home team pro
ceeded to -lose its first' game to the Los
Angeles men by a score of 3 to' 6.- The
score in detail was as follows:'
By the time Householder had passed
first the ball had found a comfortable
resting place in the fork of some upper
boughs and Moskiman â¢ was prancing
around the trunk like a dog that had treed
a coon. He shook the limbs and called
sweet nothings up to the ball, but in the
meantime Householder had made, the
round of the bags and was asleep on the
bench, so the umpire Â¦whistled oft Moski
man and sent him .back to right field
again. Householder will be made a For
ester and hereafter Moskiman will field
with a long pole.
Householder plucked a ripe home run
out of fhe trees in the right field of the
Oakland grounds yesterday morning in
the game between the Oakland and Los
Angeles teams. He got one over the plate
at just the right height and he sent it
sailing out into the country with Moski
man, Â¦who had charge of that part of the
forest. .,

OAKLAND.
The score of the game was as follows:
LOS ANGELES.
Los Angeles made its only run in the
seventh. Kelly made second base on a
long hit to right field. Swindells hit to
third and was thrown out on tirst, Kelly
making third on the play and came home
on Bowman's hit to right field.
In the second inning Rellly turned his
foot in a dodging match between tirst and
second, and there was a general shifting
when he v^ent to the bench. Hartwell
came into the game to take Johnson's
place in the box, Johnson took Hutchin
son's place at first and Hutchinson took
Reilly's. place on third.
One questionable grenius in the sunny
part of the grand stand, just behind the
plate conceived the idea of dazzling the
pitcher's eyes with the aid of a mirror.
He tried it on Moskiman, but Moskiman
spotted him in short order and called the
umpire's attention to it. Pete Lohmari,
Oakland's captain, had his own way of
settling- it, however. He knew some one
who was sitting near the disturber and he
said for the benefit of the grand stand;
"He'll stop it if he is a gentleman. If he
doesn't, let him have it where he wants
it, Mac." Mac was the friend sitting near,
and as he showed a willing-ness to carry
out Lohman's idea there were no further
reflection* cast upon the pitchers.
In the third. Francks sent a short one to
third and reached first before the ball,
which was leisurely lielded. He stole sec
ond and then- made third 'and home on a
wild throw to second. In the fifth inning
Arrellanes made a run on a base on balls,
Streib's hit to right field and rmnleavy's
hit over in the same territory. Streib
was as far as the third bag when Moore
made the third out on a fly to center.
Babbitt made the last run for Oakland,
starting on a base on balls. He made
third on Lohman's hit just inside of first
base and on outtnto right field. Lohman
made first. Then Moskiman hit to short
and made first while Lohman went out
on second, but in the rally Babbitt made
home.
Dunleavy made the first' Oakland run.
It was in the second inning, and he start
ed on a long drive to left field that was
just far eiiough inside the line to make it
fair. Then Moore, who followed him, put
another long one out past Bowman, which
brought Dunleavy home and Moore to sec
ond. Moore got to third on a passed ball,
but Drennan made the last out on a fly
to center field before Moore could make
his run rood. '
Oakland lost and won with Los Angeles
yesterday, the winning game being played
at the Recreation grounds in this city be
fore full grand stands. and bleachers. The.
afternoon game was a steady, -even one,
although five errors were charged up, and
four of them were marked against-the
team from, the south.

George Gardner and George Burns ham
mered one another through six rounds.
What they lacked in science they made
up in grit. Burns had the better of it the
last round and was awarded the decision.
The call of time saved Gardner from a
knockout.
Gus Brown and Ed Kelly went the limit,
six rounds, and though Kelly Was severely
punished, winding up with a broken rib,
he got a draw by his hard work in the
last round. Brown's Ions reach and cool
head were more than a match for Kelly's
aggressiveness.
The first bout, between Bert Fisher and
John McDonald, was short but fierce.
Early in the first round Fisher put Mc-
Donald on Queer street with a right jolt
to the mark, and put him down and out
with two left pokes to the jaw. -

these places Erne will go when he trains
for his fight with McGovern in June.
Frank Erne did not stay long at the
training quarters of McGovern. He told
the latter he did not come out to see him
work, but just for a friendly call. Terry
and he shook hands as Erne drove off,
and then the former took a ride to - the
Cliff against wind and dust. Upon his re
turn he stripped and began his afternoon
work, which consisted of a four-round
bout with Dougherty and two rounds with
Dukelow. Terry put in the morning by
covering seven miles of park roads. This
Is his regular work and he shows up well
under it.
Over at Croll's Gardens there is an ear
nest little fellow who improves each min
ute of his time. Oscar Gardner is train
ingâthere is no mistaking it. At present
a cut lip keeps him from boxing, but he
does enough hard work to compensate for
the lack of cuffing â¢with his sparring part
ner. Gardner is in tip-top shape and
grows stronger every day of" his training.
He seems to be more than >earnest, too,
and will not for a moment give way to the
general public belief that McGovern is in
vincible. "Wait," he says. "I am going
to settle old scores this time. I think I will
come out oMhis fight the victor."
Gardner looks as if he meant what he
says. There is no doubt that he is train
ing hard, -and McGovern knows it. He
realizes it so completely that to-morrow
Terry will change his training quarters
from the Casino to the Terminal, just to
get away from distraction and visitors,
and work in a place where the "crowd
cometh not."
BUSS AND KENNEDY WIN
DOUBLES TOURNAMENT
They Defeat Gleason and Levy by
Two Points in Final Hand
. â¢ ball Game.
Russ and Kennedy defeated Gleason and
Levy yesterday in the final game of the
Olympic Club doubles handball tourna
ment by a score of 51 to 49. The game
was one of the most exciting- played in
the regulation court in many days. Russ
did. not, however, play up to his usual
form, and Gleason had little trouble re
turning his serve. Gleason was unused
to the ball, and did not return It to the
front wall with the accuracy for which he
is noted.
Kennedy and Levy surprised the experts
by their consistent playing. They were
in splendid condition and played to win.
At the outset of the contest Russ and
Kennedy secured a lead of 14 points. This
was lessened in time, and when the 30
mark was reached the score was very
close. Gleason and Levy evened matters
in the forties, and then passed their op
ponents. The game then took on a serious
aspect for Russ and Kennedy, and they
played hard to win out.
The score was 44 to 45 in their favor when
Levy went in to serve.' He sent a low,
swift toss to Russ, and made 49. He then
hit the side wall and went out. Gleason
then tried. He sent a swift one to Russ,
and it was returned to the wall. Gleason
lobbed the ball and it struck one of the
rafters, and he was out. 4
Kennedy then went in, and by a hard
serve won the game and first prize for
his team. ... '
Gleason and Levy will receive silver
medals. With the victors, they will re
ceive trophies for their skill on Wednes
day evening during the progress of the
wrestling tournament.

Asks Barney Schreiber to Put a Pries
on the Great Brown
Colt.
ThÂ« many and impressive victories of
Barney Schreiber's brown colt Corrigan
have made the youngster about as famous
on the turf as his namesake, the gentle
Edward of Hawthorne. Sam Hildreth
has had his eye on the son of imp. Sain.
and one day last week asked Barnev to
set a price on his colt. The St. Louis
bookmaker, without hesitancy, said: "Ten
thousand dollars Trill take him." And
horsemen do not consider the valuation
exorbitant. Notwithstanding the re
peated wins of Corrisran, Trainer Dick
Williams, who has charge of Schreiber's
other two-year-olds at the Missouri stud.
Insists there is a black fellow there, also
by imp. Sain from Caroline Hamilton, the
dam of Tayon, that can lower the Califor
nia wonder's number. Schreiber hopes
he can.
V. Kelly, a fairly promising boy in the
saddle if increasing weight does not
soon retire rum, left for New York ves
terdav. He goes under engagement to the
well-known turfman. Jack Follansbee.
Several stables will depart for the East
this -week. A. carload will be shipped to
day, containing the horses of Pat Dunne,
Danny Lynch and Andy Blakeley, their
destination being Chicago. In the same
car John Phillips will send Tayon, which
horse will be specially "prepped" for the
St. I^ouis Inaugural, in which handicap
the four-year-old has been allotted 107
pounds.
Domlnick. the kingpin lightweight
rider, will not pick up his "tack" and
board the overland until the latter part
of the week.
Sam Hildreth will not put his horses
aboard the cars until Thursday or Friday
of the rresent week.

T.nrr. to OW2T CORBIGAl!*
OSCAR GARDNER, at his training
quarters, Croll's Gardens, Ala
meda. and Terry McGovern, at the
Casino, the road resort north of
the park, were two very important
young pugilistic gentlemen all of yester
day forenoon and afternoon. At both
places crowds composed of the curious
who like to Jook upon the prizefighter
when he works in preparation for "the
event" gathered In numbers too great for
the peace and quiet of mind of the prin
cipals who will meet in the great battle
of featherweights on April 30. Gardner
had a busy time of it at Alameda, but his
was a Sunday-school session compared to
the tempestuous though informal recep
tion forced upon McGovern.
Of all the visitors that crowded and
blocked traffic at the Casino the most
welcome was Frank Erne. He came out
In a team on Saturday to' see Terry and
Manager Harris to talk about a prospec
tive fight in which he should figure as a
principal. The featherweight was at the
track at the time and Frank Erne re
turned to town a disappointed man. But
he met his game yesterday and one hour
after his arrival at the Casino he was in
deep-browed consultation with Sam Har
ris. Frank Erne left the Casino satisfied.
He says that, although no definite promise
of a match with McGovern was declared,
he is assured' by Harris' tone that he will
fight thÂ© Wonder and the Terrible some
time In June.
When they approached the Casino on
the return McGovern asked Erne where
he would train for his fight, if there
should be any. "At Sausalito or Alameda,"
was thjp ready response. "I want aÂ«place
where there is water â swimming, sailing,
Then the two kept silence for a time,
one resting on a retrospect of victory, the
other uneasy in a recollection of defeat.
The third party asked McGovern if he
would give Erne a chance for another go.
"Why, of coarse," said Terry. "If Har
ris gives the word, why, I'll right Shar
key."
, Along- the dust-blown rqad the two
trudged, perfectly at ease and communi
cative as two youngsters out of school.
They talked of training quarters, of fight
ers, of mutual friends and of the Califor
nia climate. Both agreed as to San Fran
cisco being a city in which there is life
and fun. They want to remain within its
confines for some little time and taste of
Its good things.
The meeting yesterday between McGov
ern and Erne was the first since last July,
when there was no talk but all fisticuffs,
somewhere in a roped ring: in New York
city. 'â¢Hello, Frank," "Hello, Terry" and
a handshake and the two were together
as if they had never crossed fists. "Let
us get away from the crowd," said Erne,
and Terry assented. Accompanied by a
Call representative. Erne and McGovern
strolled through the park. There was
nothing bellicose in the conversation be
tween these two noted pugilists.
"Hope you have a house something like
ours in New York last July," said Erne.
"Wasn't it great," was the McGovern
reply.

MISS GERTRUDE DTJTTON, "WHOSE RARE CHARM AND , FASCINAT
ING BEAUTY HAVE MADE HER A GENERAL FAVORITE IN SAN
FRANCISCO SOCIETY DURING THE PAST SEASON.
Somebody has been telling me things
again about the Century Club and about
a stormy meeting 1 , in which the Iadie3 ex
changed words, peppering their sentences
well with the thoroughly feminine but al
together unclubllke exclamations, such
as "Now there!" and ""Well, I don't
care!"
It was all on account of the coming big
reception and the very necessary adjunct
to aU successful entertainmentsâ the re
freshments. Mme. ' Chairman was for
having a certain caterer and the rest of
NEVKR before has a stranger come
within our gates and received
such genuine admiration and
marked social attentions as have
been showered upon Miss Agnes
Spreckels. It is hardly fair that I should
refer to Miss Spreckels as a stranger. She
is 'one of us, and it is only the fact that
she has been so long from us and intends
to' shortly again leave us that makes me
think of her as though she were a
stranger. While she is here with us, how
ever, we are all making the best of her
visitâ basking in her smile and enjoying
the rare charm, of her personality and
conversation. Agnes Spreckels is a woman
I would unhesitatingly, set down as a
beauty. She is tall and straight and
gives one the impression of inherent
physical strength. Her eyes are large and
of a soft, tender gray, and her pretty brown
hair frames a brow on which intellect is
graven in great letters. During her pro
longed stay in I>resden Miss Spreckels has
given much' of her time to study, showing,
however, a partiality for architecture. I
have been reflecting recently and have
caught myself wondering if it was not
the study of architecture, that love for
the strong and the big and the beautiful,
that has given to Miss Spreckels her
broad, generous views and her happy,
concise way of expressing them.
For those of us who have only met Miss
Spreckels at the formal affairs that have
been given in her honor I am sincerely
sorry. If I were one of them I should
maneuver to get an invitation to some
of those many little luncheons or dinners
at which she is honored. There they will
have the happy opportunity of seeing
Miss Spreckels at her best informal, gra
cious self.

tion of the week, was well received by a
poor] house last night, which Is hardly
< winjr to any inherent merit of the "com
edy." The company did its best with the
material to hand, which, when it is not
wildly absurd, is lavishly dull. Charles
IxxJer does a Rood German-American
fketch. and raised a hearty laugh with his
patent bicycle, with its bath-laundry
kit ohen - fort - T>'hile - you - Â¦wait arrange

a distinct addition. Charles E. Flynn has
the-only voice in the company and makes
fairly effective use of it.
Miss llayme Mayo is a shapely and
dashing soubrette, and as the New York
widow, Adora Van de Voordt, is well re
ceived. There is some good dancing by
an octet of danseuses, but the chorus
work is found wanting in most of the
things needful.

as produced in New York. The Henry
Miller season will follow, and is an event
anticipated with heartiest interest among
the piay-goers. "Richard Savage" will be
Included in the Miller repertoire.
The Orpheum' s good bill is a light amid
the dramatic darkness. Miss Francesca
Redding repeats her success of last week
in the same brijrht playlet, "Her Friend
of Texas." and this week will be gowned
to distraction in a Parisian creation that
was designed originally by Felix for
Princess Helen ot Montenegro. The gown
has a ourious history. It was ordered by
Princess Helen shortly before thÂ« assassi
nation of King Humbert of Italy, and the
order was countermanded, by reason of
the throwing of the courts of Europe into
mourning for the King's untimely death.
The dress was thus left on Felix's hands,
and was exhibited by him at the Paris
Exposition as a sample of the fine art of
gown-making-. There Miss Redding found

her fare to the exposition, she thinks it
was worth the cost. Beside Miss Redding

Â£?isson; Clayton, Jenkins and Jasper: Alf
Grant, Madame Marion von Sehrader.

Horace Goldin and Josephine and her

Kdward Eisner's version of "Under Two
Flags" will be given for the first time
in San Francisco, The play is a dramati
sation of Ouida's novel of the same name,
fi.nd is said to possess much interest in its
dramatic form. ' Miss Florence Stone is
<;as=t as Cigarette, the vivandiere, and
heroine of the story, and Jack "Vl'ebster
will assume the role of Bertie Cecil.
The Alcazar has a strong attraction for
the current week In "The Conquerors,"
.tt new play by Paul M. Potter, that has
met with great success in its Eastern
production at the Empire Theater. The
play is historical in origin, dating back to
l.he battle of Sedan. The scene of the play

the events consequent upon the occupa

Grand Pre.
The Central Theater "returns to its mut

melodrama of the days of the Confeder

HEIR TO A FORTUNE
The volunteers in camp throughout the
Presidio and the regular troops garrison
ing the post were greatly pleased at. the
reopening of the Red Cross tent yester
day, and s.howed their appreciation of the
efforts of the ladies in their behalf by
crowding the canvas structure.
Magazines, newspapers and story books
of all kinds were eagerly grasped by the
soldiers. Most of the men prefer a quiet
spot and a periodical to read to spending
their time roaming aimlessly about the
camp. The supply of reading matter in
the hands of the ladies having the tent in'
charge is ample. Their intention is to se
cure a piano and a collection of all sorts
of games to furnish amusement for the
soldiers. Maps and atlases are greatly in
demand, ; and dictionaries are greatly
needed. ,Â¦ Â¦ ' \ . >
The tent will be supplied with comport
able chairs, desks and tables, will be
lighted by electricity, and be open from
10 a. m. to 10 p.m. . Chaplain Miller of the
Presidio has i secured it for one night a
week and will endeavor to provide enter
tainment for the men.
There are at present 9000 soldiers at the
Presidio, .and the . reservation, presents a
lively aspect. Hundreds of visitors spend
hours there daily, and the scene is not un
like the appearance of the reservation at
the outbreak of the war. Six regiments
of volunteers are quartered in the camps
and the men appear happy and contented.
They will remain for at least three weeks,
as> the force employed in preparing the
finals > will require that time to prepare
them for the mustering out process.

The city is in complete readiness to re

since the palmy days of floral festivities
has it been so profusely decorated. State

The Grand Parlor will hold its first ses
sion to-morrow morning, and arrange
ments, have been made for a drive over
the mountain boulevard in the afternoon.
In the evening there will be a reception
at Grace M. E. Church. The delegates
appear to be a fine aggregation of repre
sentatives, and . the most interesting
Grand Parlor for many years is expected.
Some j)f the Â¦ candidates for office have
been here since yesterday and there has
been some wire-pulling. It is generally
conceded that Frank Coombs will be the
next grand president/but there will be a
fight between S. A. Jones and Lunstedt
for the secretaryship.
SANTA BARBARA, April 2Lâ The Na
tive Sons arrived at 9:30 o'clock on the
special train this, evening. They were
somewhat travel worn, but reported a fine
trip. At Paso Robles they stopped an
hour and a half for luncheon and saw
the town. The special also stopped at
nearly every other place along the line.
There was a big 'crowd at Victoria sta
tion . to meet the delegates this evening,
and arrangements were made for lodg
ings. The city is full of tourists already,
ana it has kept the reception committee
busy to find accommodations for all.
The overland from Los Angeles with

the festive abalone -was again to be in
vestigated. Crowley went down as al

Iiively Buzz of Politics.
However auiet the trainload of Native
Sons may have been to outward appear
ances, it was a-buzz with political ex
citement of the Native Son sort. If two
delegates shook hands across -the aisle
conversation ignored the weather and
went at once to ; "politics." "How are
your fellows standing on the fight for
grand orator?" "Whom do the country
members want for grand trustees?" "It
looks as if it were Lunstedt agraln, don't
it?" These were the sort of preliminaries
that soon had six carloads of . "natural
born" politicians humming like beehives
of a spring morning. ~ .'Â¦'..-
Interest mainly centers in the contest
for grand orator. Superior Judge Dooling
of San Benito County and Superior Judge
McLaughlin of Plumas County are the
candidates, and. not a delegate can be
found who will' claim a victory for either.
The two Judges are great personal
friends, and the contest has nothing in it
foreign to fraternal feeling, but a fight
of the liveliest sort is beine made of- it.
S. A. D. Jones of Pacific Parlor, late of
Pomona, is in the field for grand secre
tary, but the consensus of opinion is that
Henry Lunstedt will be re-elected hands
down.
Of course. Grand First Vice President
Frank L. Coombs, Grand Second Vice
President Lewis F.' Byington and Grand
Orator McNoble will move up the official
line in regular order. The office of grand
marshal will go to the town which gets
the 9th of September celebration. Sacra
mento will very probably be thait^town.
MEEK, subdued and shivering in
the "cold, gray dawn," 200 del
egates to the Grand Parlor of
the Native Sons left by special
train at 7:30 o'clock yesterday
morning. An unusually large number of
them were accompanied by their wives,
and many enthusiastic members of the or
der who were not delegates -were aboard
the train, so that when the special pulled
out from the Third and Townsend streets
depot its six coaches carried fully 300
people.
The early hour, the chill air and the
taste in the mouths of the delegates of
the high jinks provided for them the
night before by the Past Presidents' As
sociation precluded any particular show
of enthusiasm- Delegates from parlors
all over Northern and Central California
hurried to the depot, hunted out their
particular friends in the coaches and
quietly settled themselves for as com
fortable a ride as possible, content to let
the fireworks of enthusiasm wait until
some such thing as delegations of Native
Daughters at Pajaro bearing tribute of
luscious strawberries and mellow apples
should furnish the spark to set them.go
ing.
A large number of the celebrities of the
order were aboard the special train. Hen-
George L. Jones of Quartz Parlor, Grass
Valley; A. M Smith of Argonaut Parlor,
Oroville, and William Wagoner of Arrow
head Parlor, San Bernardino, are among
the other candidates for grand trustee.
As to results, everybody is guessing.

From outside of San Francisco Grand
Trustees Radcllff and Knowland are can
didates for re-election. McLaughlin and
Dooling having chosen - to fight it
out for grand orator. Knowland of
Alameda and Radcliff of Watsonville
have both made excellent records
as members of the State Assem
bly, and as both are popular in
the order, their re-election is regarded as
assured. Radcliff resurrected the Big
Basin Redwood Park bill, a pet measure
of the Native Sons, after it had been done
to death in committee, and his persistent
efforts were mainly responsible for the
final success of that measure, Knowland
fathered several important educational
bills and the famous Chinese slavery bills,
and was chairman of the committee that
investigated the San Francisco police
scandals. . .
Candidates From. Interior.
Candidates for grand trustee are
legion. By tradition four of the seven
will be chosen from the country parlors
and three , from San Francisco parlors.
Percy V. Long. Will D. Shea and James
L. Gallagher of San Francisco are candi
dates for re-election. In addition. Stephen
\. Costello of Pacific Parlor. Senator J.
H. Nelson of San Francisco Parlor,
Thomas E. Curran of Dolores Parlor and
Major Boxton of National Parlor are can
didates. "
So far, Santa Cruz is the only rival of
the capital city for that honor. Vallejo
wants the next Grand Parlor, and ap
parently is slated for it, though the San
Francisco delegates may decide that the
metropolis needs the plum.
J. Emmet Hayden of Mt. Tamalpais
Parlor of San Rafael is a candidate for
grand outside sentinel.
,More successful than the greatest ex
pectations of its managers was the Vere
in Eintracht fair, which closed last night
with a grand ball at the hall on Twelfth
street, near Folsom. It is expected that
more than $2000 'will -be.- realized for the
fund for renovating the building, to
which purpose will be devoted the net
proceeds. ,--. - , Â¦Â¦.--.
U It was a merry throng that gathered
about the booths, had Â¦â¢ fortunes told,
danced, â¢ ate. Frankfurters and drained
copious steins, all in aid of the cause.
One of the â¢ most interesting features
was the voting contest. A score of young
ladies were entered . in '.the lists, and at
a. late hour the counting of Â¦ ballots was
commenced. 'The leaders for the prize of
beauty were Miss F. Hays and Miss E.
Kaufman. In the contest for the most
popular,, the same relative, positions
were held by Miss E. Schernstein and
Miss A. Gerichten. Each young lady's
partisans -watched the count with eager
interest, and so great was the balloting
toward the close that at a very late hour
all the votes had not been counted.
The evening's programme embraced
choruses by the German singing sections,
turning by members of the Oakland Turn
Verein, glees by the Alpenrosll, . exhibi
tions by the ladies' turn sections, : mass
choruses by vocalists from all . German
organizations, concluding with classic
pyramids by the turn section of the Ein
tracht Verein.
Finally came the dance, and the closing
hours of the fair were whirled away to
the merry strains of waltz," polka, schot
tische and quadrille.

BIG -FINANCIAL SUCCESS
Retail Cigar Dealers Organize.
An organization of retail cigar dealers
has recently been formed in this city, by
which they seek to protect their interest
against undercutting in prices. A com
mittee was appointed, consisting of J. N.
Gregory, M. ';oblentz. H. IC. Riblet and H.
Kupey. This body will wait on all dealers
with the view of having them agree on a
fixed price at which cigars shall be sold
by retailers. This move is aimed at such
dealers as trade in Chinese-made cigars
and who can afford to undersell the hand
lers of Eastern-made goods.
More than 200 proprietors of 10-cent bar- I
ber shops met in B'nai B'rith Hall yester
day afternoon and formed the Boss Bar
bers' Protective Union. Organization was
effected by the election of L. E. Conrad.
president: M. J. Silva. secretary; Sigmund !
Stearns, treasurer, and Samuel Oppen
heimer. sergeant-at-arms.
Representatives from the Journevmen \
Barbers' Union were present, and there
was a friendly discussion, lasting several
hours, as to what prices should be
charged. The rates on hair-cutting and j
hair-singeing ic was agreed to raise to 25 I
cents. Whether sea foams should be
charged for at the rate of 10 or 15 cents
vas decided in favor rf the lower price.
Whether to charge 35 cents each day for
a shav/> or 25 cents on Sundays and "holi
days was the greatest and most difficult
question to solve. The smaller barbers
urged 15 cents straight for seven days a
week, and carried their point by a decisive
vote on division.
In order to fully discuss the matter with
the Journeymen Barbers' Union a com
mittee, consisting of Lehman, Levy. Ober
ly. Heller and Silva, was appointed to
meet its delegates to-night and report -
back to the parent body at a meeting to
be held on Tuesday night. If the rates
and other arrangements are satisfactory
they will be adopted formally on Tuesday
night.
.Andrew Lindberg, residing .at 115 Milton
street, had a lacerated wound on his heao
dressed at the City and County Hospital
yesterday, which was inflicted by his son
Conrad. Father and son had a disagree
ment over, a domestic matter while at
-dinner and the son picked up a dish and
threw it at his parent, - cutting a deep
gash in his forehead.
Assaulted by His Son.
George Lods says that he has always
been willing to work and that he has now
coming to him a week's wages, from the
Humboldt Lumber Company. He says
he has not worked steadily but that he
has earned his own living and has'paid
his family $4 a week. Latterly, he says,
he has split this up and has paid $2 to his
mother and;J2 to his father.
The son tells a different story. He says
his father has been in the habit of strik
ing his mother and that yesterday morn
ing he struck her twice. He suggested
that she go into another room, but he
says his father followed him and ordered
him from the house. He says the old man
pulled down the folding bed in which he
slept and proceeded to dismantle it and
then went for his revolver. There was a
fight and the father was wounded. The
Bon says the father was the one who
brought out the revolver.
Charles Lods, the father, has been head
carpenter of -the Spring Valley "Water
Company for thirty years. He says he
has repeatedly secured positions for his
son and that he has had him working in
various places, but he. would not keep
any of them. He says tie came home yes
terday and upbraided the young man for
his idleness and that his son went over
to. where a revolver was kept and at
tacked him with it. There was a scuffle
for the possession of the weapon and fath
er and son rolled over the floor in the
struggle. Mrs.. Lods was a witness to it
all and she seized a mallet and joined in
the flg-ht. She struck George a heavy blow
on the head, which weakened him, and as
he loosened his hold on the revolver it
was discharged. The bullet entered the
right thigh of the old man, pierced it and
struck again in .the calf of the leg. It
went nearly through again and lodged
under the skin near the ankle, where a
surgeon at the Emergency Hospital found
it and cut it out. The young, man was
arrested on a charge of assault to mur
der. ;
There has ljeen bad blood between
Charles Lods of .120 Diamond street and
his son George for some time, the father
laying it to the idleness of his boy and
the son to the disposition of the father.
The father says his son will not work
and | the son says his father drinks and
strikes his mother, and so the trouble has
been brewing: until it culminated in a
shooting affray. ' . :
In the presence of the wife and mother
yesterday a father and son fought for the
possession of a revolver and tne fight
ended only, when the weapon was dis
charged and the father was sorely wound
ed. It was fortunate that one or the other
was not killed. '
