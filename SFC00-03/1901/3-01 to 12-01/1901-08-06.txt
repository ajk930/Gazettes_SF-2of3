amount of oil shippe"d from Bakersfield in
June was 35,000 jtons. In May it was 37,500
tons.}. Assuming an average of 35,000 tons,
the business from Bakersfield alone would
amount to 420,000 tons. At 6 barrels to the
ton and 42 cents per barrel, this would
. amount to $1,058,400. . This same quantity
with a spur charge of 4 cents per barrel
would amount to $100,000 in round figures,

cents for the other half of the same serv

Mr. Sproule . testified on Thursday last
that in fixing the rate for transporting
crushed stone for road purposes the rail
road company figured as carefully as it
could and made a rate of 7 5-10 mills per
ton, with the privilege of holding it at its
own convenience. The testimony yester
day- showed the company was shipping
lumber from Portland at $3 per ton for
more than 750 miles over two mountain
ranges at approximately 4 mills per ton
per mile and wheat from Og-den over 800
miles at $4 10 per ten, or approximately 5
mills per ton per mile; that It was ship

other articles. The witness said the dis
tance in railroad miles between Los An
geles and San Francisco was 482, from
Bakersfield to San Francisco 314 and from
Los Angeles to Bakersfleld 168. He said
the oil rate from Los Angeles to San
Francisco was- 12-10 cents per gallon, or
51 4-10 cents per barrel, which is equal to

GENERAL. MANAGER KRUTT
SCHNITT. WHO TESTIFIED
IN THE OIL RATE CASE.
William Sproule, freight traffic manager
of the Southern Pacific, and Mr. Krutt
schnitt were the only witnesses examined.
Railroad Commissioner Laumeister had
recovered from his indisposition and was
able to take his seat with the other- mem
bers of the board.
In his effort to show the Railroad Com
missioners that the Kern County oil men
â¢were being overcharged by the railroad
for shipping their oil to this city and en
vironments Attorney Short examined both
vitn^sps on the cost of operating trains,
on rates between other points and asked
other pertinent questions.
Attorney Short opened the examination
by asking Mr. Sproule the rate on oil be
tween Beaumont. Tex., and three other
pointsâ New Orleans, San Antonio and El
P3so. Mr. Frroule dispatched a clerk for
the necessary information, and during the
interim the witness enlightened the Com
missioners en the lumber traffic here and
in the north. When the clerk returned
Mr. Sproule read off the following state
ments in answer to the question;
The rate on petroleum from New Orleans tn
Eeaumcnt, a flistence of 2T8 miles, is $2 40 per
ton, or S% mills -per ton per mile. Between
San Antonio and Beaumont, a distance of 293

his verbal attack on Mr. Krutts';hnitt,
and when the day's proceedings came to
an end honors were a trifle In favor of the
railroad company. Attorney Short and

BERLIN, Â¦ Augj 5.â The announcement of
the death of the Dowager, Empress Fred

that' of the Empress Frederick. Born

British throne, she became successively

few months wholly bereft of power, re

of an Emperor. Following the period of
mourning for her imperial husband. Came
the harsh, unfilial conduct of her son, who
did his utmost to ; make her feel that in
Germany there was no abiding place for

VICTORIA'S OLDEST DAUGHTER.
Incidents in the Varied Life of the
Empress Frederick.
CRONBERG. Aug. 5.â Closely following
the announcement of , the. death from the
castle the church bells -were tolled and
the . flags half-masted. Â¦_ Visitors to the
castle 'began inscribing, their, names in a
book placed for the 'purpose in the hall.
It ls>aid ttie cause of death' was dropsy,
accompanying cancer. The remarkable
vitality' of .the . Dowager Empress aston
ished her physicians. She retained con
sciousness to the end. The castle grounds
are now surrounded by soldiers and pa
trolled by hussars and mounted police.
"The world . shall not learn what' I am
suffering! I will not be pitied in my mis
fortune." ' .
The papers.assert that the Dowager Em
press long ago adopted her husband's
motto, "Learn to -.suffer without com
plaining.'.' She recently ordered, that the
public should r be excluded from â¢ the
grounds of Friedrichshof, saying: "
the flags on all public buildings were half
masted. It is taken for granted that the
interment will be at Freidenskirche, Pots
dam, by the side of Emperor Frederick,
but the date, of the function is not yet
known publicly.
The marriage of Victoria and the Prus
sian' Crown Prince appears to have been a
genuine love match." Â¦'Frederick Â¦was one
of the most genial and gracious of men,
possessing . few of the harsh characteris
tics of the Hohenzollerns, while his bride
The teaching of the Prince Consort pro
duced great effect on the mind of his
eldest daughter, who had from her
earliest years been his constant compan
ion. He delighted in her quick intelli
gence and lively mind. While she was but
a child he had encouraged Â¦ her to under
stand something of the pursuits which
most interested him and into which sha
was able to enter with the keenest pleas
ure.. She' often accompanied him in . his
walks, when he taught her to know every
herb and plant by its English, German
and Latin name. It was his custom when
she was only 13 to impart to her the con
tents of letters embracing a political cor
respondence with almost every civilized
country and to show her copies of hla re
plies. Political â¢ economy was added to
the usual course of studies.
Companion cf the Prince.
The Queen was reading to her one day
from the Bible, when she came to the
words, "And God created man In his own
image." The Princess exclaimed. "But,
mamma, surely not also Dr. 7" Need
less to say, the doctor was not a hand
some man.
fled in by no means low tonea that she
resented this intrusion on her privacy.
When, less than a year after this scene,
the Prince of Wales was born, his preco
cious sister retired from the front row a3
heiress to the crown of England. When
the Princess was three year3 old her
mother writes that she "was quite a lit
tle personage, who speaks French and
English with great fluency and choice of
phrases. Pussette learns a verse by
heart, which - ends' | -with, 1& tableau se
deroule a mes' pieds" (the tableau muylls
itself at my feet). To show how well she
understands this difficult line I must tell
you the following bon mot. "When she
was riding on her pony and looking at the
cows and sheep she turned to her govern
ess and said, 'Voila le tableau que se de
roule a mes pieds' (there la the tableau
that is unrolling at my! feet). Is not this
extraordinary for 'a child of three year a
old?"
"We leas%d cars in order to put them
into the., service. . The rate in itself was
not compensatory. We were forced to put
in both rates by ' controlling conditions
with which we were confronted. The low
rate was given Bakersfleld and Coalinga
for the purpose of developing the country
and the oil industry. The rate by water
from Los Angeles to San Francisco was
a secret one and made by people in Los
The rate on oil from Coalinga to
Hanford is 15 cents per mile. A rate was
made on cement between Colton and San
Francisco to meet the competition by
water. Cement is freighted to this City at
$4 per ton for 528 miles,, which is at the
rate of 7 6-10 mills per ton per mile. The
rate on pomace is 1 cent per mile."
"In; shipping livestock," Mr. Short sug
gested; "you permit shippers to mix their
animals?" -
"Yes," answered the witness, "but they
don't desire it. In shipping horses with
hogs I fear the hogs would come out at
the worse end of the arrangement."
"But they would benefit by their higher
association," replied Attorney Short.
After this bit of pleasantry Mr. Sproule
Oil Cars Were Leased.
oil transportation was at that time, in the
hands of parties who were in the oil busi
ness, operating from San Pedro; that
when oil was discovered in Southern Cali
fornia the people called upon the railroad
to assist them. Their only avenue of ex-,
porting their oil was by water. They were
compelled to put their oil in barrels or
iron drums or sell !t to companies.
"Thereby," sa?d Mr. Sproule, "the in
dustry was troubled, and the producers
called upon us for help. Prior to that time
we had a rate of 1 2-10 mills per gallon
from Newhall to San Francisco to try to
capture the oil from the water carriers
via. Ventura. We, however, made a condi
tion^ that the exporter furnish the cars.
When the people of Los Angeles called
upon us for the same rate they had no
cars, and it was considerable expense to
get them. We saw an opportunity of de
veloping a new industry. But for our ac
tion in the matter people would have been
compelled to "sell to private oil companies
or charter craft for the purpose of trans
porting oil. They would have created
new lines of transportation. It was inter
est in the development of a new industry
and country that led us to make a rate : of

THE LATE EMPRESS DOWAGER FREDERICK OF GERMANY, MOTHER
OF EMPEROR WILLIAM, WHO DIED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AT
CRONBERG AFTER AN ILLNESS LASTING SEVERAL MONTHS.
Â¦ WASHINGTON, Aug. 5.â A dispatch
was received at the State Department to
day, from. Embassador White announcing
the death of the Dowager Empress' of Ger
many. The dispatch was sent to the
President at, Canton.
LONDON, Aug. 5.â The news of the
death of the Dowager Empress Frederick
spread slowly in London. The Associated
Press gave Buckingham Palace, Marlbor
ough House and the Mansion House the
first information that her Majesty had
passed away. As all the members of the
royal family and many of the officials are
out of town on holidays, it is not expected
that official recognition of her' Majesty's
death will be issued before morning. The
bells of St. Paul's Cathedral will be tolled
when the Home Secretary. Mr. Ritchie,
officially informs the Lord Mayor/ of the
death of the Dowager Empress. The offi
cials of the German Embassy had not
officially heard the news at 7:30 p. m.
Their, colleagues at The Hague, on the
other hand, received the news of the.de
mise of the Dowager Empress before it
had occurred, ! and halfmasted the lega
tion flag at about 3 p. m. The Foreign
Minister and the members of the legation
here cabled the legation at T*he Hague
when the mistake was discovered and the
halfmasted flag was hastily removed.

The usual gayeties of Cowes regatta

or on a brief visit to friends. Mrs. An

Queen Alexandra will leave here for Marl
borough House to-morrow. It is not
likely they will start for Berlin until
Wednesday.
'Â¦ A general alarm was , turned in for
apparatus and ambulances, and in the
meantime the work of rescue was volun
tarily begun by those in the neighborhood
that were not injured. Here and there
a person was dragged from the'ruins be
fore the fire could reach the victim, sev
eral lives being saved by the prompt
work. When the firemen reached : the
scene the flames had reached great head
way anrl were igniting the buildings
across the street. The fire, however, was
soon under control and with the exception
of a small blaze here and there "the fire
was extinguished .in a few, minutes. i
The work of digging away the ruins was
then begun in- earnest. Near the edge of
the debris several colored men were taken
out and sent to the hospitals.
The "Jefferson and the Pennsylvania
hospital*, which are located nearest to the
scene of the, explosion, were soon crowded
with the injured. None of those taken to
the hospitals had died up to midnight.
â¢Two hundred men are now at work clear
ing away the* wreckage. The buildings
containing the poolrooms, clothing store
and the restaurant were three-story brick
structures, while the other buildings .were
two ' and qnp -half stories. '
At 1:30 a. m. the only known deaths are
those at the .hospitals, that of an un
known colored woman and a 2-year-old
colored child. â¢ ', â¢ ; ,
At Pennsylvania hospital five of the pa
tients, it is thought, will die before morn

hospitals will also die." Among these' are
Samuel Gale, aged. 40 (white),, and his
daughter Florence, aged 20. Both are
badly burned in addition to other injuries.
- Of the Rosenthal family Minnie, aged 12,
was taken from the . ruins seriously in
jured and will die. The father is also
badly injured.
: Firemen and Policemen at Work.
Up to 1:30 a. m. the : police or ' fire offi
cials cannot add to the list of the dead,
but are positive that' a number of bodies
are still buried under the ruins.' Large
forces of firemen and policemen are at
work removing, the .wreckage,; ;but at this
writing have found no;bodies. â¢
; From forty to forty-five persons are to
night .lying", in /the several hospitals suf
fering more or less severe injuries. : .
At 2 a.m. the rescuers - came" across the
apparently inanimate body of a colored
woman/ but;; remarkable 'to ; relate, the
woman was alive; and, asked' for water.
She ,was quickly" 1 placed ' in; an ambulance
and sent to a hospital. ; She is Lizzie Wat

for four and a half hours. : , . } ,;
-. Five minutes-later, the .body., of *a negro
man was found. ' He .was not identified.
Victims in the Ruins.
A terrible cry . went up from the ruins
the moment the explosion occurred'.
Women, children and men, occupying the
wrecked houses, were seen crawling out
of the ruins, while the agonizing cries of
others were heard in the wreckage. . From
all the surrounding buildings injured peo
ple came running and fell into t!-ie streets
unconscious. To add to the horror, fire
broke out in the debris the moment it
settled to the ground, and in less than
five minutes the great pile was burning
fiercely from end to end.
The., explosion occurred about 9:30
o'clock. ~\Vhat exploded and how it hap
penedis not known at this time, but It i3
believed to have been a barrel of gasoline
in ones of the three grocery stores. With
the exploslomat : No. 1008 the front walls

Five persons were killed and 200 were

says the disturbance was not of a political
character and no traces of a revolution

be discovered. The rioting lasted several

amount to 1,502,000 barrels. The bulk of
the oil Is shipped to San Franciso and vi
cinity. In May, 1901, 6954 tons were shipped
from all points of the Coalinga district.
The heaviest month the railroad has had
from all points in the Kern County dis
trict was 37,586 tons, the witness said.
..Mr. Sproule was allowed to depart and
an adjournment was taken until 10 o'clock/
this morning. - . - /
The Southern Pacific Company handled,
he showed, in the years 1898-1900 from the
Kern River district the following quanti
ties of oil:
â¢98-'99, 66 tons; '99- p 00, 6845 tons; 'OO-'Ol, 250,
9S3 tons. - . . _ .. \,i:.v.
Mr.. Sproule was then recalled and read
a tabulated statement showing the list of
oil shipments, in tons from the CoaJInga
and Kern County districts, beginning July,
1898, down to June, 1900. He showed that
the average capacity of a car was twenty
five tons; that the oil in Kern County
district was heavier than that of the Coal
inga district; that oil averaged about 7%
pounds to a gallon. . - Â¦â¢â¢ â Â¦
Mr. Sproule Recalled.
Southboundâ Through freight, 18 hours and 5
minutes; way train, 29 hours and 15 minutes.
Northbound â 17 hours and 10 minutes; way
train. 28 hours and 15 minutes. --
Â¦ Despite the answer Attorney Short grew
more persistent. He asked what it would
cost to run a freight train to Ban Fran
cisco, and Mr. Kruttschnitt replied:
"The answer is obvious. I am to say
that the whole cost of running a train is
wages and cost of fuel. I am not ready
to admit It. I never believed it. T have
given you the average cost of running
trains on this division. If we* admit that
the oil train can be run for wages of men
and fuel, some one else would ask, 'Can't
the cattle train be run for the same?' and
another would ask, 'Could not the grain
train be run for the same?' Then we
would reach the absurdity that trains can
be run over the road for the wages of men
and cost of fuel. Every train bears its
fair share of expense."
, "Assuming that a train loaded with oil
should return empty, what would be the
portionof expense of taking it back?"
"The same," answered the witness. â¢â¢
' Mr. Kruttschnitt in answer to a ques
tion said the locomotive burned 175 gal
lons of oil, which equaled a ton of coal.
He said if coal and oil cost the same he
would use coal, as there would be no
necessity of changing the engines Into oil
burners, thus saving between $500 and $600
on each engine. He said the time occu
pied by a freight train ' plying between

was allowed to leave .the witness stand
until Mr. Kruttschnitt could enlighten
Mr. Short on matters pertaining to the
cost of building roads -and the profits
from them.
Mr. Kruttschnitt Testifies.
Mr. Kruttschnitf was asked the cost of
constructing the spur line from Kern City
to the Oil River district. He brought forth
a number of statements from his pocket,
and after consulting one of them an
nounced that it cost $110,000. When asked
what the length of the spur track was,
he replied that there is a track running
from the main line to Little Oil City sta
tion, which is called Kern River, which is
6 41-100 miles long, and springing from
that line is another track 2% miles in
length, making approximately nine miles
of track. He was then asked to show
how the $110,000 was expended to build this
spur, and he read off the following items
of expense:
Railway, J1650; clearing, grabbing and grad
ing-, $11,240; trestles, culverts, etc., $5489; turn
tables, telegraph lines, water tanks and build
ings, $15,910; track material and labor, $58,551;
ballasting $3765; fare and freights, -Â«S709: rental
of cars, hand cars and locomotives, $1135; train
service, wagres of locomotive men and train
men, $3975. Total, $109,838. . .

this juncture.
Wages of Train Crew.
Engines TJsing Oil.
At the opening of the afternoon session
Mr. Kruttschnitt was asked by Attorney
Short to tell. what wages a train crew
operating between this city and Bakers
fleld would receive. The witness said it
was necessary to have' six men on a train
and he enumerated the engineer, firemen,
conductor and three brakemen. He said
the engineer received from $4 to $4 50 a
day, a conductor $3 50 and a fireman and
brakeman $2 50 per day. Mr. Short then
did some figuring and made, the witness
admit that this would amount, to about
$45 per day. The attorney then interro
gated the general manager about coal and
oil as fuel for locomotives. Mr. Short
read the following passage from a booklet
issued by the railroad:
The Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads
have adopted oil as fuel and are now using
about 6000 barrels a day. These two roada
have about 600 locomotives In use In California,
which are bÂ»Inff equipped for burning oil as
rapidly as the supply can be assured. Over
200 locomotives are now using fuel oil, which
consume thirty barrels each a day. When the
remaining 400 locomotives burn oil it will re
quire 18,000 barrels a day to supply them, or
about 6.50O.00O barrels a year, which Is nearly
double tbe entire production of the State at
preaant. The Santa Fe has recently made ; a
contract for 750,000 Â¦ barrels a year for five
years at a price said to be $1 a barrel at the
wells.
The witness admitted that to his knowl-
"Eliminating those Items," said the at
torney, "what other expenses are neces
sary to move the train?" ;. .- â¢
"If those other items were not. Included
you could not move the train?'- replied the
witness.
Judge Short and the witness then ar
gued the matter. Mr. Kruttschnitt de
clared that he did not want to testffy to
an absurdity. He said the railroad com
pany could not run the train without
rails, crosstles, dispatchers, .telegraph op-
"I should say that every item on. the
route up to the portion of. the salary of
the president was needed to move that
train." Â¦". ' .â¢ Â¦ .
Attorney Short interrogated the witness
along these lines for the purpose of show
ing the Railroad Commissioners that the
cost of running a train from Bakersfleld
to this city was nominally a small one.
He next asked Mr. Kruttschnitt whether
there was any expense outside of fuel and
wages of train crew. The question was
cleverly parried by the witness, and the
attorney and railroad manager had a
merry tilt. Mr. Short was persistent and
Mr.- Kruttschnitt was on the defensive.
In answering the question the manager
said: . . Â¦ '
Cost of Running Trains.
The witness was next asked the number
of tons of coal it takes to fire an engine
to pull a freight train of thirty cars be
tween Bakersfleld and West Oakland. Mr.
Kruttschnitt said he preferred to answer
this question correctly, and Mr. Sproule
obligingly, went to the office and had the
matter looked up. Mr. Kruttschnitt, on
getting the data, answered that twenty
four tons of coal would be needed and
that this would cost about $100< This he
based on the average cost of coal on the
Western and San Joaquin divisions.
edge both ' roads were rapidly 'changing
their engines into oil burners. He said it
was very expensive to make the change.
He was then \ asked the amount of coal
used by an engine traveling between Bak
ersfleld and "West Oakland, and he replied
petulantly that he . had been answering
questions in an unsatisfactory way. He
stated he was trying to give Â¦ categorical
answers to all questions and had on. re
ceiving the subpena directed his clerk to
furnish him with information that was
said to be desired. Tf Mr. Short wanted a
proper answer to that question he would
have to send to his office and have it
looked up. Mr. Short expressed the de
sire, $o a clerk was dispatched. In the
meantime Mr. Kruttschnitt informed his
auditors that the price for coal paid by
the railroad for the Western division was
$4 30 per ton and for the San Joaquln divi
sion $4 24 per ton. The cost of running a
train one mile on the Western division
was $2 20 and on the San Joaquin division
$2 42. The~slze of the train on the West
ern division 'wou\d be twenty-six cars and
on the San Joaquin practically the same.

KANSAS dry, Aug. 5.â The exposition
building erected during the boom of 1887
at a -cost of over $200,000 was destroyed
by fire in less than two hours' time this
afternoon. The fire started shortly after
1 o'clock within ten feet of where Patrick
Gilmore stood when he directed his
famous band at the exercises dedicating
the building fourteen years ago.* A boy'
among a crowd which had gathered to
watch a large circus that had pitched its
tents across the street set fire, in a spirit
of mischief, to\some loose rubbish lying
on the floor. In a moment the flame
leaped beyond control, spreading almost
instantly throughout the whole building,
which occupied a half-block square. No
effort was made to save the building.
The exposition building was situated at
Twelfth street and Kansas avenue, three
miles from the center of the city. It had
not been occupied for ten years. Recently
a syndicate planned to raze it to make
way for modern buildings. The loss 13

Most hair preparations are merely scalp

Union Adopts Resolution Declaring
Against TTse of I*iquor.
At a largely attended meeting the Pile
Drivers' and Bridge Builders' Union "held
yesterday afternoon a resolution was
unanimously adopted declaring that the
sense of the union was for total absti
nence during the continuance of the
strike. The passage of the resolution was
greeted with hearty cheers.
The men realize that the strike Is likely
to" prove a prolonged affair and that to
win it they must husband their resources.
Leaders of the movement at the meeting
yesterday spoke of the benefits that would
accrue "to the' members of the union
through their evincing, a desire to shun
the saloons, not only in a monetary sense
but through the fact that by shunning
liquor they would remove themselves from
all danger of hazarding the success of
the strike by the violence which intoxi
cated men are likely, to indulge In. Ef
forts will be made to secure co-operation
of the other unions in the movement. /
FIGHTING THE BOYCOTT.
Issues a Circular.

The Pacific Coast Beer-Bottlers' Pro
tective Association has prepared a circu

nouncing that the association will protect
John Rapp &. Son against the boycott by
keeplng hands oft the trade of that lirm.
The circular continues:
- Our action in this matter may not meet
with the approval of all, but thooewho are
in a position to know the facts, certainly would
be with us if properly informed. We have been
refused the privilege of hiring our own men.
Our members have been compelled under threat
of ' strike and boycott to reinstate discharged
employes. I without . the privilege of arbitration,
upon which clause the union makes its great
boast. In spite of the. fact that the union had
an agreement with us for one year regulating
hours and wages, they disregarded this agree
ment and made new demands of Increased
wages and shorter hours before the agreement
then in force had expired, to which demands
we submitted, r 'Â¦"-.' " '.."Â¦Â¦Â¦ :: Â¦Â¦>Â¦
We have been told not to give our horses
to a certain blacksmith to shoe, and In all of
these instances we have submitted to the de
mands of the union in order 'to avoid com
plications. New difficulties arose from . day
to day. and in all instances arbitration was
refused. Our employes have received all that
they asked for. in wages and hours without
opposition,- but .the dictation from/ outside
sources became unbearable, and . the last
straw came when," without a. moment's no
tice, the men were: called out of -one of-our

Will Stand Firm, for Increase From
S3 to $3 50 a Bay.
OAKLAND, Aug. 5.â The striking
painters of Oakland did not secure their
increase in wages and there are Indica
tions of a prolonged struggle. The master
painters to-night refused to grant the
increase of wages demanded and the men
who struck this morning have . decided
that they v.-ill stay out until their" union
has an opportunity to meet and consider
the situation.
The painters submitted to the employers
a wage scale which fixed the minimum
day's waeres at $3 50 instead of $3, as at
present. The employers refused the In
crease and .this morning 300 painters,
paper hangers and decorators left their
work. As the demand for the Increase in
wages was not a new one the employers
were. In a large measure, prepared for the
strike. Contracts ofÂ»large size and with
time limitations were all refused. The
employers waited to see whether the men
would make good their threat of walking
out, and when 'they did it was thought
that the result in Oakland would go with
the result of the same demand in San
Francisco.'
The Master Painters' Association held a
meeting to consider the situation and
finally decided to stand by their original
refusal, and they empowered the execu
tive committee to prepare an .announce
ment for the press, which was given out
as follows:
OAKLAND. Aug. B. 1901.
The members of the Master Painters' Asso
ciation of Alameda County, at a meeting held
this evening unanimously indorsed the action
taken. at a former meeting not to grant the
demand of the painters' union for an increase
of wages to the minimum of {3 50 per day.
L. ,X. COBBLEDICK, Secretary.
The members of the executive commit
tee are: President.' James Cahlll: secre
tary, L.. N. .Cobbledick; E. C. Thurber,
John Donovan and C. L. Metzger. There
were present about forty of the members
of the association. .
In speaking of the stand taken by the
master painters. Secretary Cobbledick
said: "We have decided to stand to
gether as one man. We are unanimous
in the stand taken and will not grant the
demands of the journeymen painters un
der- any 'circumstances'. Non-union men
are now . applying for work, and in a
week's time we expect to have all of the
places vacated by the union men filled.
The San Francisco association Is standing
with us in the matter and we have no
fear of the outcome. This strike is -in
augurated principally by the poorer Â¦work
men, .who were not being paid $3 50 a day
The result is that the good workmen have
been drawn into the strike to assist the
others." . - â¢
President : R. P. Poorman of the Jour
neymen Painters'. Union said: "We met
this evening and indorsed the stand we
took two months ago. "We will not recede
from our demands for a wage of $3 50 a
day. "We will meet again Thursday even
ing and may . take some further action
in the matter, but I- am not prepared to
say what that action will be." â¢
OAKLAND PAINTERS OUT.
MATOR PHELAN failed to get a
conference of the board of di
rectors of the Employers' Asso
ciation yesterday. M. F. Mich
ael, attorney for the associa
tion, had gone out of the city, and re
sponses were not obtained to requests
made to Individual directors that they be
present.
At 11:30 a. m. the Mayor met a number
of merchants in his office, among whom
were Raphael Welll and A. M. Davis. All
but one of them disavowed any connec
tion with the Employer!*' Association.
These men decided against asking for an
other meeting of the Employers' Associa
tion, and at 3 o'clock Mayor Phelan sub
mlÂ£ted Attorney Michael's letter of August
2 to the labor leaders.
The Mayor gave out the following state
ment late In the afternoon:
The situation is as follows: The City Front
Federation, of which the Teamsters' Brother
hood Is a part, proposed the following basis
for the re-establishment of peace:
City Front Federation,
Southwest corner East and Mission Streets.
SAX FRANCISCO. Cal., July 31, 190L ,--
Hon. James D. Phelan, Mayor, San Fran
cisco Cal. â Sir: As per your request, the
City Front Federation hereby submits the
following propositions as a basis for the
re-establishment of peace: The Employ
ers' agrees that its members
â¢will not discriminate against any employer Â¦
or labor because such employer chooses to ,
employ union men only.
' The Employers' Association agrees-that
its members will not discriminate against
any employe because he chooses, for reasons
sufficient to himself, to be a member of a
labor organization.
The Employers' Association agrees that
all employes who are locked . out or who
have quit work on account of the exist
ing difficulty shall be reinstated. Labor
organizations agree that any member who
is employed shall, while in such employ,
obey any orders given . to him concerning
the work to be performed." Whenever any
difficulties arise between employers and em
ployes no strike or lockout shall be insti
tuted until the parties in interest shall
have done all in their power to adjust such
difficulties.

evening, through its executive committee, made
the following counter preposition:
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 2, 190L
Hon. James D. Phelan, New City' Hall,
San Francisco â Dear Sir: Your communica
tion of August 1, 1901. with reference to the
present differences between the members
of the Draymen's Assoclatlon'andthe mem
bers of the Brotherhood of .Teamsters ha^
been submitted by me to the executive com
mittee of .the Kmployers 1 Association. ' In
pursuance of your request for a reply, the
Employers' Association instructs me to ex
press its attitude concisely as follows:
The Employers' Association Is willing to
recommend to the members of the Dray
men's Association that they fill all present
and future vacant positions In -their ser
vice by such persons as may apply, for
work. Irrespective of .whether the applicant
belongs to a union or not, upon the follow
ing terms:
First â That the employe will obey all law
ful orders of his employer.
Secondâ That the employe will not, direct
ly or Indirectly, attempt to compel aÂ« fel
low employe, against his free will, to join
a labor union, nor to compel his employer
to employ none but union men. .Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦â¢
Thirdâ That the employe will not, directly
or indirectly, engage In or support any sym
pathetic strike or boycott. _ *
I am Instructed to define the attitude of
the Employers' Association with regard to'
â¢ unionism, as follows: .
First â The association recognizes the right
of labor to organize to ameliorate Its con
dition.
Second â The association has not In the
matter of employment discriminated in
favor of or against union men, and has no
intention of doing so.
Thirdâ With regard to the adjustment of
differences between employer and employe,'
this association has made It clear in Its
previous correspondence with you that the
settlement of all such- differences must be .
left to the employer and own employes,
' without Interference from the officers or
members of any labor organization.
Fourth â It has been -the practice of this
. association not to discriminate against any
employer of lp.bor solely because he has in ,
hie employ none but union men, and it. is
not the intention of this association to de
part from that practtce. Yours truly,
M. F. MICHAEL.
Labor Leaders' Objection. .
The representatives of the Federation took
exception to several points and on. Saturday I
asked the Board of Directors of the Employers'
Association to consider the objections, inas
much as the letter h*ad come from their execu
tive committee, with a view of modifying or
explaining some of the terms. . I made an
explanation, and while the board of directors
refused to modify the language they explained
its meaning. There was no serious objection to
the first and second conditions of re-employ
ment; but the third was objected to by the
representatives of the federation on the ground
that it was a- legal right of the employe to
engage In a sympathetic strike or boycott. The
employers answered that If It is a legal right
it can be exercised, and they bo desired me to
explain to the labor leaders. â¢
The Employers' Association disavow any
intention td sympathetically boycott any
employer of union labor by refusing to sell him
goods. This they state in their fourth para
graph defining the attitude of their association
with regard to unionism and is a concession
to the federat.on. The employers also yield
their original Intention of employing none but
non-union men and concede the right of their
men to form organizations.
I delivered the letter 'to-day to Messrs. Furu-
Sfcth and Casey, at a conference at which City
Attorney Lane and P. II. McCarthy, president
of the Building Trades Council, were present,
explaining these several matters -as I received
them from the Employers' Association, and
they were to report the letter to their,feder
ation this evcnlns.
End of Negotiations.
This morning I conferred with-, representa
tives of business Interests and explained the
situation. There were present gentlemen repre
senting the shipping Interests, the commercial
Interests and the retail trade,- and the Munici
pal League, as well as a representative of the
Employers' Association, who was not present,
however,' in that capacity. The. only point
argued was the â¢ advisability of - asking the
Kmployers' Association to meet again to strike
out their third condition of re-employment,
namely, that the employe will not engage in a
sympathetic strike or boycott, on the ground
that It wa3 a legal I right of the employe and
that such a modification might serve to pro
mote peace; but as the employers had agreed
not to sympathetically boycott employers oC
union labor by refusing to sell them goods, it
waa considered 1 , that that was an offset and that
such an agreement at any rate had no legal
force or effect. .. There was, nothing that could
prevent a man from leaving his employment,
with or without . a grievance. ,
Th^ negotiations have resulted in giving to
both sides a. better understanding of their re
spective demands and allowing them to coolly
deliberate and agree to respect each other's
rights. Â¦
SITUATION IN OAKLAND.
If each aide did not get all It desired, what
ever concessions have been made should, I be
lieve, be accepted in the right spirit and
industrial peace be restored. These negoti
ations, with the delivery of the letter, seem
to -be at an end. I requested the leaders to
Impress upon their men that It is the serious
business of the municipality to keep order and
to see that order is maintained.
. '-", JAMES D. PHELAN.
THE number of men working* on
the water front since the com
mencement of the strike was
doubled yesterday, but the same
congestion of traffic still exists.
On every. wharf along the*front there was
a gang of men at work, and the large
number of Idle men in evidence on every
block of East street was the only visible
evidence of the mighty struggle between
labor and capital that is in progress in
this city. '
Among the men who are able to Judge
of the progress made by crews in handling
cargoes, however, there is a feeling -that
the strikers have succeeded in making
great strides toward a general tie-up of
the shipping. Vessels that were scheduled
to leave days ago succeed In getting out
of the harbor, but they leave several days
behind time and with their* holds only half
filled.
Vessels that entered the harbor loaded
to the gunwales with freight and that
were due to leave port within two or
three days after their arrival have been
unable to get away,, owing to the fact
that, though plenty of men are obtainable
to handle freight, these men cannot dis
charge or load a vessel in the time al
lowed them.
With freight coming from the holds of
vessels and load after load arriving hour
ly from the wholesale houses, the ship
owners are greatly handicapped, but they
have succeeded in accomplishing a won
derful lot of work. At the wharves of the
various steamship companies "bunk
ships," or floating boarding houses, have
been established, where non-union bands
are boarded and lodged. The first few
days of the strike the men who took the
places of the union men were allowed to
board and room where they pleased, but
the strikers' pickets were so vigilant that
they stoppec^the men on their way to and
from work and won many of them from
their employers. The number of men who
reported for work every morning- was be
ing gradually reduced, until the. shipping
men gained a knowledge of the tactics
being pursued by the strikers. Since the
establishment of the floating boarding
houses on the front there has been little
accomplished by the strikers in securing
recruits.
Floating Boarding-Houses.
The steamer Colon is being used by the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company as a
boarding and lodging place for the hands
employed on the Mail dock. The company
has 250 men quartered on the vessel. Ar
rangements have been made whereby the
wives, sons or daughters of the men who
are employed can draw their wages, thu3
relieving them of any need they, might
have to leave the scene_of their labors.
The firms of Ben..ett & Goodall, Eschen
& Minor and Thomas Young & Co. have
chartered the Ohio and will quarter all
the men they hire to take the places of
the strikers on the vessel. Cooks and wait
ers have been hired and arrangements
have been completed to furnish accommo
dations for more than 500 men. The Ohio
will be anchored In Mission Bay and the
men will be taken back and forth in tugs
to the wharves where they are to work.
In consequence of this move on the part
of the ship owners and boss freight hand
lers the force of pickets employed by the
unions has been greatly increased. Mem
bers of the unions patrol the bay in all
sorts of craft and. they lose no opportunity
to approach the vessels on which the men
are living and make every endeavor to
win them over to the cause of unionism.
The work of discharging the cargo of
the collier Tellus was commenced yester
day shortly after noon at Folsom-street
dock No. 2, where the Dunsmulr bunkers
are located. A gang of twelve negroes at
tempted the task of emptying the im
mense holds of the vessel, but as they
were all green hands they made slow
progress.
The experienced longshoremen work in
the holds of a vessel totally unmindful
of the Iron buckets, each containing a ton
day by the river steamer/ Sonoma. The
fruit was reshiDped in cars from Adams
wharves.
There has been no disturbance, either
on the water front or among the team
sters. The few non-union drivers who are
working are unguarded, and there Â¦ has
been no attempt to" molest them. The
police report no trouble on. the harbor,
the sailors' union delegates making no ef
fort to resist the guard that has been
placed on the Adams docks. The situation
on this side of the bay is controlled
by the movement cf affairs in San Fran
cisco, and the unions interested look to\
the headquarters across the bay for direc
tion concerning their future action..
There were a number of patients treated
at the Harbor Emergency Hospital yes
terday, but there were no serious cases,
most of the injured being non-union
stevedores hurt through their lack of
knowledge of the way to handle freight.
The force of clerks employed by A. M.
Simpson were on hand bright and early
yesterday morning to unload the steam'
schooner Signal. The schooner Gotama
was pulled alongside the lumber vessel
and arrangements were made to transfar
the cargo to her. .The first sling of timbers
had hardly been passed over the sMe.
however, when the captain and' mate of
the Gotama put on their coats and re
fused to handle any more of the cargo.
At the transport dock the loading of th-e
Meade continues. The Government offl
clals had considerable doubt as to their
ability to get the transport ready for sea
by the loth and had made arrangements
to replace her for the trip with the War
ren, which is expected in dally. So much
work was accomplished yesterday, how
ever, that the latter plan was abandoned.
The arrivals yesterday were th* City of
Puebla. the Milton and the Coronado.
The crew of each of these vessels quit
as soon as the ships reached the wharves.
The firemen on the City of Puebla did cot
go out as the order issued by the City
Front Federation does not affect the ves
sels of the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany.
The Pomona, which was scheduled to
sail for Eureka yesterday at 2 p. m., did
not get away until after 5. She was not
fully loaded when she pulled away - from
the dock. She was the only vessel to clear
during the day.
Pomona Alone Gets to Sea.
There was more fruit landed at the
Jackson street wharf yesterday than was
landed on any two days since the incep
tion of the strike. There seemed to be
little difficulty encountered In securing
teams to haul it to the commission houses
and consumers.
At the Oceanic dock there are fifty men
employed on the steamships Australia and
Mariposa. The Australia will be ready
to sail on Wednesday and it i3 expected
that the Mariposa will be ready for sea
when her sailing date arrives.
The collier Titania which arrived yes
terday will be moved to Rosenf eld's coal
bunkers at the foot of Mission street this
morning, where the work -of discharging
her cargo will be commenced. The col
lier Milton is anchored in the stream tnd
men are engaged in transferring her cargo
into the'hulk Germania. The coal on the
Bristol is being taken out of the vessel
and put in the bunkers at the sugar re
finery. . '
The work of coaling the Chilean mail
steamer Aconcagua is progressing rapidly
at the Oakland wharf. She is also bein?
loaded with wheat at the same time. She
will probably be brought to this side of
the bay this afternoon. She will dock at
Howard street pier No. 3, to which
freight for her is being hauled.
At the dock of the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company the steamers Colum
bia and George W. Klder are being load
ed. It is expected that the first name.1
vessel will be ready to sail to-day. The
100 men who are handling the freight
destined for these vessels are living and
sleeping on the dock and extreme pre
cautions are being taken to prevent the
strikers or their sympathizers from ap

embarrasses the coal people is the fail

PAINTERS LEAVE WORK.
Andrew Furuseth, secretary of the Sail
ore' Union of the Pacific, said last night
that for the present at least the strike
â¢would not be extended beyond San Fran
cisco and San Francisco Bay.
"While we are conducting a merely local
fight," Mr. Furuseth said, "we do not in
tend to extend it to other ports. That
will only be done when necessity compels
it. For the present no reason exists for
such a step. The fight is on in real
earnest. We have gone into this fight
to win, and we shall win it. too. So far
as the City Front Federation is con
cerned the unions affiliated therewith are
in a position to stand a siege of two
months without serious difficulty. We
were hoping a prolongation of the strike
might have been averted, but through the
obstinacy of the Employers' Association,
which is determined to do all in its power
to kill the labor organizations in this city,
business will get another setback far
more serious than may at this time be
imagined, i ?Ye ask but for little, but that
little, affecting as it does the principles
of organized labor, was denied us. We did
not ask anything- the employers might not
have freely granted without loss of dig
nity, but our r<?quâ¬st was met with scorn.
The workingmtn of Â»this city will not be
responsible for what the future may give
birth to."
Emploj'ers who were informed last night
of the action of the Labor Council com
mittee were surprised that no bolder
move was made. It was pointed out that
while the strike of the sand teamsters
would doubtless hamper the building In
dustries the weapon was not particularly
dangerous, since the building trades un
ions are not affiliated with the Labor
Council, and there is no probability of a
sympathetic strike extending to them. In
other -words, if the contractors are able to
pet sand and cement hauled In spite of the
strike of the sand teamsters the carpen
ters, brick masons, etc., will not strike
because non-union men are hauling the
material-

only conference he secured yesterday
went up Into the air, negotiations were
ended, and the labor leaders went back
to their headquarters to take the first
steps of their plans for the prosecution
of the campaign.
The calling out of the sand teamsters
was the single move made by the Labor
Council. The executive board of the City
Front Federation contented itself with
the adoption of resolutions, as follows:

"The executive committees of a number
of unions consulted with the executive
committee of the Labor Council with the
view of taking strike measures." ,
eociation â a letter full of premeditated in
sults and deliberate falsehoods â has been
forced to take immediate steps to defend
the rights of the workers of this city to
organize for the improvement of their con
dition. The Sand Teamsters' Union -was
requested to order its members to strike
Wednesday morning:.
At the close of the meeting last night
Secretary Rosenberg gave out the follow
ing statement:
"The executive committee of the Labor
Council, having been informed of the con
tents pf the Jetter of the Employers' As-

determined upon after a lengthy discus
sion of the strike situation. The order
affects 530 men and means that practically
all building operations going on through
out the city must cease unless non-union
teamsters can be secured to replace them.
At the meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Labor Council last night :t
was determined to order the Sand Team
sters' Union to join the ranks of the strik
ers to-morrow morning. This action was
To-Morrow Morning.
Order of Committee Goes Into Effect
SAILOES TO TAKE ACTION.
"One of the reasons why we shall not*
grant this demand is the increase in the
cost of material. Oils and leads are high
er-now than they have been for some time
and to pay our men more than they are
receiving now would mean ruin to our
business. We are backed in our determin
ation by the Master Painters' Association Â¦
of Oakland."
"We have decided that the condition of
our business does not warrant the pay
ment of higher wages to brush hands. We
pay the men what they are worth, and
every member of the association has men
in his employ to whom he pays more than
$3 00 per day. Evidently the order issued
by the union does not affect these men,
for they are still at work.
E. H. Black, president of the Master
Painters' Association, said last night:
"We were informed three months ago
that an increase of the pay of painters
would be demanded by the union August
5. We appointed a committee to meet with
a committee from the painters, but the
meeting resulted unsatisfactorily. The
members of the association have met
often since then and thoroughly can
vassed the situation. As a result of our
deliberations we have determined to re
fuse to grant the demand. Our members
are under ?500 bonds to live up to the laws
of the association and so far only one
member has shown a- disposition to grant
tire increase.
Cannot Afford to Grant Demand.
Xinety-four shops have been reported
to the council as in accord with the above
mentioned request. Many shops which
are supposed to be definitely opposed to
the raise have signified their willingness
to employ men at ?3 50 per day. The
Building Trades Council, therefore, feels
confident that it is only a matter of time
until the other employing painters will
see the wisdom of doing likewise. The
council desires to state to the public that
as far as the painting industry is con
cerned, building construction in the city
will not be retarded. The Building Trades
Council desires also to announce to the
public that the Building Trades Coun
cil is the only order concerned in the
controversy and. that being true, the
public need not fear that any erratic or
overt action will be committed, but, on
the contrary, the council will conduct the
matter in its usual conservative manner,
looking only to the best interest of the
city and State.
"Reports from the pickets which were
appointed to the different shops all point
to a grand success, as far as the $3 50 per
day is concerned. Many shops which"
were considered doubtful up to this morn
ing have conceded the raise in pay and
stated that the demand made by the
Building Trades Council on the 4th of
last May in behalf of Painters' Union No.
73 was a very just one.
If the employers are organized and
united to resist the demands of their men,
the Building Trades Council, which is
handling the flgrht for the painters. Is
equally well prepared to fight the matter
to the end. At the meeting of Painters'
Union No. 73, which was held last night
at the Turk-street Temple, it was claimed
that a great number of the important
shops bed already conceded the increase
in salary. The painters look upon the flght
as already virtually won and confident
ly assert that almost all the employers
will give In this morning.
The executive committee of the Build
ing Trades Council took part in the meet
ing of the painters last night and after
the meeting was concluded P. H. Mc-
Carthy issued the following statement in
behalf of the committee:
On the other hand P. H. McCarthy of
the Building Trades Council asserts that
but 220 painters have been compelled to
quit work and that the others of the uion
are working under the new schedule.
Both Sides Are Prepared. '
In accordance with their preconcerted
plan, the members of Painters' Union No.
73 reported for work as usual yesterday
morning, but on the refusal of their em
ployers to grant their demand for an in
crease of 50 cents per day In their pay
they walked out. The demand for a raise
in wages had been made three months
ago. so both the men and the employers
were fully prepared for'the action which
was taken yesterday morning. In fact,
the employers have formed an association
for the express purpose of resisting the
demands of their men. The Building
Trades Council has taken the fight in
hand and will have the entire manage
ment of the controversy, in bo far as the
painters' . end of it is concerned. The ac
tion which both bodies have taken thus
far seems to indicate that the struggle will
not be of short duration.
The master painters appear to be
strongly organized and claim that almost
every employing painter of importance in
the city is a member of their association.
The rules of the association place a line
of jaOO on any member who shall increase
the salary of his men to $3 50 per day.
The master painteis claim that there are
between 500 and 600 painters out of em
ployment because of the strike and that

importance who has granted the demands

was the main subject of discussion at the
meeting of the Sailors' Union of the Pa
cific last night. About 500 seamen were in
attendance.
Secretary Furuseth delivered an address
In which he reviewed the steps taken by
the City Front Federation to secure a set
tlement with the Employers' Association.
He declared that everything possible was
done to secure a compromise, but the at
titude of the employers was such as to
preclude the possibility of concluding the
negotiations to the satisfaction of all con
cerned.
The union decided to submit a proposi
tion to assess all the working members of
the organization 10 per cent of their earn
ings during the pendency oi the strike.
It was also agreed to make $1000 imme
diately available to assist needy striking
longshoremen pending the arrival of the
necessary funds from the International
Longshoremen's Association.
Another resolution was adopted dircct
v ing the fcaoking committee to Â¦withdraw
'SjOOO of its funds from the bank as a
strike fund, the same to be disbursed un
der the direction of the union as circum
stances may require.
The proposition of a daylight parade
was broached, but no action taken. The
intention is to organize a labor demon
stration. The matter will be brought to
the attention of the federation at an early
date.
All watchers along the water front were
directed to appear at the union head
quarters at 9 o'clock this morning for

Five union minersâ Jacob > Williamson,

warrants from Judge Cabaniss yesterday
afternoon to recover possession of their
blankets and personal effects, which, they
said, were being illegally detained in the
office of the Draymen's Association at 109
California street. They said they had
been engaged by an employment agent at
Los Angeles to come here to work. Noth
ing was said about the nature of the
work, aiTd when they arrived here they
were taken to the office of the Draymen's
Association, where they deposited their
blankets and other personal effects. They
are all Russian Finns and can speak very
little English. When they learned that
they were to be asked to drive teams be

they refused to work, as they are union
miners. They were then asked to work
as longshoremen, but again refused, and
were, they said, ordered out of the office
and their blankets and other effects which
they demanded were not returned.

the accusations made by A, Doan of Gold

ARRIVED.
Coal Cargoes Arriving.
More than 25,000 tons of coal arrived In
port during the last thirty-six hours and
most of it is finding its way into circula
tion. The Titanlabrought in 5558 tons, the
Milton 4648 tons, the Matteawan 5000 tona,
Tellus 3500 tons, Washtenaw 4000 tons and
the British ship Dumferline 3000 tons from
Newcastle, Australia. All of these vessels
will be discharged before the week Is out,
so there is no fear of a coal famine for a
few days to come.
Has a Japanese Crew.
The steamship South Portland has a
Japanese crew. While the vessel was on
the Sound Captain Hall had a dispute
with some of his men, so he discharged
them all and secured Japanese sailors and
firemen. The vessel was expected yester
day morning, but the chances are ' that
she will be a few hours late and will not
dock until to-day. Captain Hall will be
able to work his men in discharging and
has no fear of a walkout when the vessel
ties up.
"Water Front Notes.
The wrecking schooner Bessie K re
turned from Half moon Bay yesterday
with the windlass and thirty fathoms of
chain from the City of Florence.
The British steamer Monmouthshire
that was here last year in the California
and Oriental Steajnship line has been sold
to the Quehec Steamship Company and
will run in the Windward Island trade.
The army transport tug Slocum got
back to port yesterday. At Santa Bar
bara she learned that the Lennox had
reached San Francisco, so Captain Mar
shall hurried back here.
O. Wallace, a negro woman, drank car
bolic acid in a water front resort yester
day and was hurried to the Harbor Hos
pital and pumped out. She was not badly
damaged.
Charters.
The Brabloch will load \ wheat at Portland
for Europe, 37b 6d; the British steamer Cym
beline, wheat here for Europe or- Mediter
ranean ports, 40s; the MacMahon, wheat here
for Europe, 38s; the Eric, lumber on Puget
Sound for Mollendo, 55s; the India, lumber at
Blakeley for Valparaiso (owners' account); the
Governor Roble, lumber on Puget Sound for
Sydney, 42s 6d, with usual options. All char

Sun, Moon and Tide.
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey-

Waters at Fort Point, entrance' to San
Francisco Bay. Published Â¦ by official au
thority of the Superintendent. .
NOTEâ The high and low . waters occur at
the city . front (Mission-street . wharf) about
twenty-five minutes later than at Fort Point;
the height of tide is the same at both places.
The Haddon Hall had a fair run from
Liverpool here. The flrst part of the voy
age was marked by ligHt winds and
calms. On May 21 she was caught In a
very heavy east-northeast gale. It was
accompanied by a high, confused sea and
the ship was swept continuously. Four
bulwark stanchions were broken and sev
eral chain plates carried away. Consid
erable damage was done about the deck
and everything movable was washed
overboard. The run from 50 to 50 was
made in twenty days and then fair sail
ing weather was encountered. Off shore
a dense fog was run into, which delayed
the ship several days.
Away back in 1880 Captain J. B. Pritch
ard, then second mate of a wooden ship,
went home for a visit. His younger
brother was also home for a run and the
two of them "swapped lies" for over a.
week. Then they separated, and although'
each has circumnavigated the globe every
year since they never chanced to meet
again until yesterday. In 1889 Captain J.
B. Pritchard was appointed master of the
Glenesslin,- while at the same time his
brother was made chief officer of the
Haddon Hall. In 1894 Captain O. Pritch
ard received his command and has sailed
the Haddon Hall ever since. The two
vessels are chartered to load wheat for
Europe and will probably get away from
here about the same time.
Glenesslin was tied up. Seventeen of her
"lay days" have gone, but Captain Pritch
ard did not mind that, as every- day
brought his brother nearer to San Fran
cisco. After a long run the Haddon Hall
finally made port and the brothers met
again after a separation of twenty-one
years.

CALL. BUREAU.- 1406 ! G STREET. N.
TV.. WASHINGTON. Aug. 5.â That a full
and complete Investigation of the Samtf
son-Schley controversy will be made by
the Dewey ceurt of inquiry is shown by
the action taken by Acting Secretary
Hackett in ordering witnesses from for
eign stations to. Washington. Before his
departure from this city Judge Advocate
General Lemly submitted to .Hackett a
list of witnesses who could offer import
ant testimony and in the list was Com
mander Schroeder, - at present serving as
Governor of Guam and/during the war
with Spain executive officer of the battle-
Ehip Massachusetts. Hackett cabled to
Rear Admiral Rogers, directing him to
send the Yorktown to Guam to convoy
Commander Schroeder to the United
States.
Other officers who will be brought to
Washington include Lieutenant Com
mander Giles B. Harbor, naval attache
in Paris and St. Petersburg, who was
executive officer of the battleship Texas;
Lieutenant Commander Alexander Scharp.
who commanded the gunboat Vixen and
who is now executive officer of the Hart
ford; Lieutenant Commanders S. P. Com
ley. attached to the Alliance; L. C Hell
ner, on duty at the Xew York yard; Wil

tached to the bureau of equipment : A.
C. Hodgson, stationed at Newport; JE. T.
Capehart, on duty on the New York, ar.d
H. P. Huse, commanding the Villalobos,
who were navigators of the fleet.
Commander Schroeder will be able to
reinforce the testimony of Rear Admiral
Higgineon, who commanded the Massa
chusetts. As executive officer he was ac
quainted with the routine of the ship and
great stress is placed upon his evidence.
Whether he will return to Guam is not
certain. There have been complaints
made against his administration in conse
quence of the scandal in the marine de
tachment stationed at Agana. It is ,
thought here that Commander Swift of
the -Yorktown will temporarily relieve
Commander Schroeder as Governor.

In all of his efforts to have the "feeders"
of the Southern Pacific added to the main
system Â¦ Toland received but little encour
agement from the other members of the
board. He said that the law prescribed
that such roads should be considered with
the main system. The other members con
tended that that was a question of law â
whether the board had jurisdiction over
the "feeders"â and that the question could
be easily settled by an opinion from the
Attorney General in the matter. Toland
reminded his colleagues that they had had
ample opportunity to obtain an opinion
but had not seen fit to do so. The board
will take up the matter of county assess
ments next Tuesday.
Chairman Alex Brown agreed with him
in his contention that the representation
should be made. Toland received no sec
ond to his amendment. The board, how
ever, fixed the entire mileage of the
Southern Pacific Company at 2099.23 and
the assessment at $22,600,000. Other assess
ments were fixed as follows: ' â¢
When the board took up the assessment
of the railroads this afternoon Equalizer
Toland moved as an amendment to Col
gan's motion fixing the assessment of the
Southern Pacific Company at $22,500,000 on
2089.02 miles, that the 262,842 miles of "feed
ers" operated by the company be added
to the mileage of the company's main sys
tem. He said that the "feeders" are op
erated together in one system and belong
to the' Southern Pacific, and their earn
ings are returned as part of the general
earnings of the company. He objected to
the form of Colgan's motion. He wanted
the board to flrst establish the mileage
and then fix the assessment.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 5.â The State
Board of equalization late this afternoon
fixed the assessment on all the railroads
In the State. As a result of their action
the assessment this year is $1,559,730 more

STOCKTON. Aug. 5.â The Japanese
section gang, numbering eighty men,
working at Escalon on the Santa Fe road
became involved in a riot Sunday noon,
and but for the prompt action of Ira
Clark, the timekeeper, and George Dubly,
the foreman of the gang, serious trouble
would probably have resulted. Af it was,
one of the Japanese was nearly killed.
A Japanese named Kushi was accused
by one of the men with having stolen a
monkey wrench. A demand was made
that Kushi be discharged, which was re
fused. Thereupon only about seventeen
of the gang reported for work. The re
organized and made an attack on Vne
men at work, particularly Kushi. The
men attacked were put into freight cars
by Timekeener Clark. who r with the as
sistance of Dubly, kept the mob at bay,
word in the meantime having been sent
to Sheriff Sibley at Stockton.
The Sheriff, accompanied by Deputy
Smith, went to the scene and arrested
three of the ringleadersâ Morshita. Ka
tuski and Shimnski. who, with Kushi,
were brought to the County Jail. Kushi
is badly cut about the head and bears
other marks of rough handling. At one
time during the fracas about twenty of
the rioters pounced upon Kushi and would
have killed him but for the timely assist
ance of Clark, who is said to have a re
markable influence over the gang. The
arrested men will probably be charged
with assault to murder.

of Cornwall.
Unique Celebration to Be
Held at Vancouver in
October.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 5.â Great
preparations are being made throughout
Canada for the reception of the Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall and York, who will
visit the Dominion in September and Oc
tober. The Ophir, on which the royal
party is traveling around the world, will
arrive at Halifax about September 15, and
from there until they arrive in Vancouver
on October 1 there will be daily official
receptions in all the principal cities along
the route. The preparations going on now
in Vancouver for the greatest celebration
ever seen here are a fair sample of what
Is being done in all the Canadian cities,
and altogether the tour will be quite the
most aristocratic function since the days
when King Edward visited Canada more
than forty years ago. *â¢Â¦'.'*,
Besides their own suite their royal high
nesses will be welcomed at Halifax and
accompanied right across the continent by
Lord MInto, the Governor General; Lady
Mlnto, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the Prime Min
ister; Sir Richard Cartwright, Sir Louis
Davies, the Hon. David Mills and other
members of the Federal Cabinet.
Trip to the Alaska Coast.
From Halifax the itinerary will include
St. John, N. B.; Montreal, Ottawa, To
ronto, Quebec, Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary
and Vancouver. Other Eastern cities will
be visited on the return tour, after their
royal highnesses have visited Victoria and
taken a trip up the Alaskan coast. The
Canadian Pacific has placed the steamship
Empress of India, which will be in port,
at the disposal of the party to make the
run to Victoria and later take the north
ern trip if the latter is arranged.
In order to make satisfactory arrange
ments Mayor Townley of Vancouver re
cently sent a special envoy to Ottawa,
where a statement of the exact pro
gramme to be earried out in Vancouver
was obtained. The plan is on a grand
scale and will contain features absolutely
unique in Canada.
The special train of the royal party will
arrive in Vancouver at 11:30 o'clock in the
morning, and the Duke and Duchess will
remain here until next morning. The flag
ship Warspite of the North Pacific squad
ron and several of the other warships will
be in port. A request has been forwarded
to the United States Navy Department to
allow the Oregon or one of the other of
Uncle Sam's warships on the Pacific to
be here and join in the celebration. A
naval guard of honor will be in attend
ance and the flagship band with local
bands will play "God Save the King" as
the train comes in.
Ceremony at Vancouver.
His Excellency the Governor General
will then introduce the Lieutenant Gov
ernor of the province. Sir Henry Joly, Ad
miral Beaumont and Mayor Townley to
their royal highnesses. The ladles will
present to the Duchess a bouquet of flow
ers and immediately after the civic ad
dress of welcome will be read by the
Mayor. The latter will then escort the
Duke to. his carriage. Whether the as
sembled crowd will follow or precede the
procession uptown will appear in printed
instructions later..
The party will be driven to the new
military drill hall, which will be opened
by his royal highness, and at the conclu
sion of this ceremony luncheon at the Ho
tel Vancouver will be announced by the
Mayor. . There areto be no speeches at
lunch. Afterward the Mayor is to pro
pose the health of the King and later the
health of the royal visitors, which will
then be drunk. The Duke will reply to
both at one time.
Headed by a detachment of mounted
police in uniform, the party will drive
around the park in the afternoon and
later will be conducted through the Has
tings sawmill, one of the largest on the
coast. In the evening there will be an
Illuminated procession of fishing boats on
the inlet. Including Indian war canoes,
there will probably be over 2000 boats in
the procession, so that this spectacle alone
will be a unique one. Early next morn
ing the party will leave for Victoria by
the Empress.
HOTJSE OF LORDS DECIDES
AGAINST A TBADES UNION
Dismisses an Appeal From a Judg-
ment Rendered Against a Butch
ers' Association.
LONDON, Aug.. 5.â The House of Lords
to-day rendered an important decision af
fecting trades unions. The case was
brought up on appeal from the judgment
of the Irish courts awarding a wholesale
butcher damages against the Butchers'
Assistants' Association, which brought
pressure to bear on retailers to boycott
the platintiff until he dismissed a certain
non-union employe, threatening otherwise
to call out the union employes of the
firms concerned, and finally induced the
non-unionist to leave the plaintiff. The
Lords dismissed the appeal on the ground
that the alleged acts of wrongful and
malicious conspiracy were not undertaken
to advance the interests of the workmen
themselves, but solely to injure the plain
tiff. : -

When there is a natural and healthy circulation of the blood, the entire
quantity, estimated at one-eighth the weight of the body, passes through the heart
every five minutes. , This rapid flow of the blood through the system prevents the
entrance of disease germs and impurities of every description. It filters out all that
is not necessary or good for the growth and development of the body and nourish-
ing and strengthening the muscles, tissues, nerves and bones. But, unfortunately,
few persons can rightly claim an absolutely pure blood supply and perfect and
unpolluted circulation, and in consequence are exposed to innumerable diseases.

naturally grows thin andpale because of the lack of the red corpuscles that give

evidence some constitutional or blood trouble, which salves, lotions, powders nor
any external treatment can cure. Diseases that originate in the blood whether
they manifest themselves as ulcers, tumors, itching; eruptions, muscular or bone
pains, require a tonic and blood purifier such as S. S. S., which not only antidotes
and neutralizes blood poisons and humors, but possesses health-giving tonic prot>er-
ties that no other blood medicine does. It goes down to the very foundationof

Orpheum.
The versatility of Miss Alexandra Dag
mar Is -t'catching" the Orpheum au
diences. Miss Dagmar appeared at her
best last " evening and rendered a pot
pourri that called for her fullest talent.
It included "I'd Leave My Happy Home
For You," "Jammo" - and a Swiss yodel
song. As usual her costumes were, to
use the apt word on the bill, "stunning. 1
There are two sketches on the bill this
week of unusual merit. "My Wife's
Presents," as presented by Oscar Sisson,
Ester Wallace and Stuart Hyatt, not
only bubbles with fun and humorous sit
uations, but points out to the man who
seeks fun during his wife's absence that
!t is best to be good, or in any event not
to get found out. Mr. and Mrs.. Alfred
Kelcy presented "In Trust." Its situa
tions are alternately humorous and pa
thetic, withal a story with a moral a"
story with a legitimate purpose. Hill and
Silvainy's deeds entitle them to a posi
tion among the world's greatest bicy
clists. Their act is spectacular. The
Esmonds, musical artists, are also new
this week. Their work in the classical
branch of music demonstrates their su
periority over the great .host of musical
specialists whose temples of fame are
builded on foundations of ragtime. Hugh
Stanton and Florence Modena began their
second week in "A- Bargain Fiend " The
Molasso-Salvaggi troupe of dancers the
Standard Quartet and many interesting
biograph pictures complete one of the
best bills of the summer.
The ever popular drama, "Monte Cris
to," as played by the stock company at
the Central, attracted a, large audience
last evening. The trials and tribulations
cf the famous character of French fiction
drew the loudest applause of the season.
James M. Brophy in the title role was
rewarded with many curtain calls and
cheers. Brophy gave a. spirited rendi
tion of the role. Juliet Crosby played
Mercedes, and the sympathy of every
man and woman in the audience was
accorded to the actress for her clever
performance. Nortier ; was played by
William Blackmore in thrilling fashion
The balance of the cast was fully in
keeping with, the work 'of the principals.
The scenic "effects were good and cos
luming correct. This is the last week of
Brophy's engagement and his admirers
are likely to give him a series of ova
tions nightly. __Â¦].. ..
Central.
In. passing sentence the Judge said that
midnight burglaries where people are in.
danger of their lives must be stopped and
there was only one way to put an end to
them. If the prior convictions against the
defendant" had not been withdrawn he
would have sentenced him to life impris
onment. The fact of a defendant plead
ing guilty would not make any difference.
The defendant's mother was ' in court
and when sentence was pronounced she
fainted. When she recovered she turned
to Detective Dinan and said, "Now I sup
pose you a t e satisfied.". "
Albert. Abernathy, the young burglar
who pleaded guilty in Judge Cook's court
to a charge of having broken into the
grocery of Henry Daesking, 1 Polk street,
on the night of June 8, appeared for sen
tence yesterday. The ; Judge sentenced
him to serve fourteen , years in State's
prison. At the prisoner's request, San
Quentin was named as the place of con
finement.
Withdrawn Sentence Would
Have Been Life.
If Prior "Convictions Had Not Been

ABERNATHY GETS TE1T
. . YEARS FOB BURGLARY
"Camille" was revived at the Alcazar
Theater last night by Florence Roberts,
supported by White TVhittlesey and the
memters of the stock company. The
cozy theater was crowded, proving that
this sentimental, drama has lost none of
its attractiveness. Camille is' perhaps
one of the- strongest and most effective
roles in Miss Roberts' repertoire, and last
night she was accorded the most gener
ous and thoroughly deserved applause
from the large audience. There is no
question of her superiority in scenes
where pathos is required. The scene
known as "the sacrifice," in the third
act. was admirably portrayed by h"r
and Barton Hill, who gave a faultless
rendition of the part of Monsieur Duval.
No less effective and convincing was the
scene at' the fete in the fourth act be
tween her and her lover. Armand . Du
val, in which White Whittlesey scored
a pronounced hit. They had to respond
to several curtain calls before the en
thusiasm of the audience subsided. Lu

pood circumstances to make provision for
their Indigent parents. As things are now
any number of children shirk the burden
of their responsibilities, and the result is
that a large number of aged persons make
application to be admitred to the Citv and
County Almshouse who have children who
are -well able to take care of them. This
has resulted in such a congestion at that
Institution that the Board of Health Is
forced to think up some plan to relieve it.
It is thought that such a law would be
very effective, as few sons would be will
ing to appear, in court as the defendant
in such a case.

Two characters in McCormick's revolu
tionary drama "The Tollgate Inn," play
ing at the Grand Opera-house, manage to
keep up the interest of the audience to
the end, and they are Poatchee, the half
breed, personated by Theodore Roberts
and Ned Pennington. by Frank Mathieu
There is a subordinate third. Captain
Snell, the traitor. Indifferently acted with
a London accent by Herbert Ashton. The
play is an episode of redcoats and conti
nentals, in which patriotism, murder and
love-making .are the salient elements. Mr.
Roberts' Indian pleased the audience
mightily; and they rang up the curtain on
him several times last night to clap hands
at his artistic work. It is the gem of the
performance. Next In the affections of
the house is Frank Mathieu, who shows
up with all the dash and fire of youth in
brilliant contrast with the almost . too
quiet walking, gentlemanly role of Colonel
Maitland, by E. J.- Morgan.. Katherine
Grey has much work to do as Hiram's
daughter, the maid who seems to love two
men but who chooseo the colonel in the
wind-up, when virtue triumphs and the
villain ceases to pursue her. ' Miss Van

cast in a secondary place. â¢ '

conscientiously acting the part as well as

of the curtain there was no break in the

The part of Mrs. 'Dane is one that most
actresses would gladly attempt and as
lamentably fail in. Margaret Anglinâ
bravo! Margaret Anglin! â has succeeded,
and at a bound has placed herself with
the Bernhardts and Fiskes and such like
pictures of the role emotional. Miss An
glin's metier of- high comedy has left one
quite without expectancy for the kind of
work she does in Mrs. Dane. Her third
scene, her cross-examination by the law
yer, where she lies, lies, lies, to save love
for herself, getting more and more hope
lessly entangled and hysterically con
scious of it, recalls even the "La Tosca"
torture scene 111 its strength and painful
ness. Â»
pleasant lady discovers something of the
truth about Mrs. Dane, and with a very
evident hatred of the sinner bids her go
and sinâ in some other village. She suc
ceeds eventually In driving her from Sun
ningwater. from her newly found friends,
from a man Â¦whom she has lftrned to love
as worthi^' as her kind can and from her
hope of a new life. By an ingenious and
rather cruel device of * the playwright,
Mrs. Porter is made to eat her own words
and dies (presumably) without the blessed
corsciousness that she was in the right
of it after all. It should be here said that
the dangerous and difficult subject matter
of the play is handled with utmost deli
cacy, thai the audience supplies the
"past" and the moral.
As in "The Case of Rebellious Susan,"
from which Mr, Jones has freely taken
some of his charactersâ for their better
developmentâ the 'moral is left hang'ng
in the air. Only at the end is any sug
gested, when Mrs. Dane asks despairing
ly. "What is it that is driving me from
you all? Why cannot 1 stay; why are
you so unkind? I have been found out;
that is it."
"It is not we who are unkind, the law
yer says, "not I. your friend, nor Lady
i-astnery here, who has been fighting. for
you all 'week. It is the law that neither
you nor I made. The law, that we should
all gladly break, for we are all sinners;
but it is the law."

The matter was reported to the police

his surprise there was no sign of an in

The clerk went. with him to a lodging

towait in a room while the- prospective
purchaser went into an adjoining apart

Discovery Made by De-

Search "Warrant."
Detective Ryan succeeded yesterday In
locating a. portion of . a consignment of
carpets valued at $2000 that was stolen
from the Indianapolis Furniture Company
at 750 Mission street on March 16 of the
present year. He secured a search war
rant in Judge Cabaniss' court and when
he visited the ' place where "the stolen
property was supposed to have been
stored was rewarded by finding a portion
of it. As yet the thieves have not been
apnrehended. but warrants Â¦will probably
be"procured for their arrest to-day.
On the night of March 16 the large store
room of the furniture company was en
tered and looted. Some of the carpets
taken were 'among the most valuable In
stock and the robbers profited handsome
ly by their haul. They must have used
an express wagon, which they drove
around to the rear of- the store and loaded
with their booty. Â¦ â¢ "
The police were at once notified and De
tective Ryan took charge of the case. He
was unable for some time to get on the
track of the burglars or locate their loot.
About one week ago. however, he ob
tained a clew that a portion of the stuff
had been stored In a house in the imme
diate neighborhood, and accordingly ap
plied for the search warrant yesterday.
He found that he was on the correct trail
and discovered about $300 worth of carpet
which the furniture people identify as a
portion of that which was taken from,
their storeroom.

The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals held a session , yesterday, with
Judges Morrow "and De Haven on" the
bench. No business of importance was
transacted, and the court took an ad
journment until August 19.
When the telephone message was re
ceived at the Southern Station that a man
in room 30. 906 Market street, wanted to
be taken home, as he was afraid of strik
ers, the officers thought a non-union man
had been eorralod anu needed their aid.
They were considerably surprised on their
ai rival at the address given to find that
the iriEn who appealed so pitifully over
the nhene was a special officer named
Reed. They were a disgusted lot of po
licemen, but they bundled the quaking
special into the patrol wagon and took
him to his home at 327 Clementina street.
That they did not stop to tuck him safely
in bed was because of their anxiety to be
rid of their charge.
The spectacle of three of Chief Sul
livan's finest escorting a special police
man, armed with pistol and club and a
five-pointed star to his home was one of
the queer scenes to be met with last
night. That he was escorted home was
due to the fact that in telephoning to the
Southern station he did not mention- that
he was a special policeman.

policeman come along he would surely
have been .arrested.
Mystery surrounds the little affair be
tween the man who ran and the one who
pursued. About* 6 o'clock they began
to quarrel on Market street opposite the
nay store. It was a quiet evening, and
Collins, who learned to enjoy a good
mill when he had something to say about
issuing prize-fight permits as a member
of the board, leaned against the door
and hoped. He got more fun than hjs

street. The man with the revolver r>ur

bravely rushed out and grappled with they

HENRY ARTHUR JONES has
Â¦written a great play. Marparet
Anglin is a great actress and the
Empire Theater Company is an
unqualified success; such was
the verdict of last night's audience at the
Columbia Theater at the giving of "Mrs.
Dane's Defence."
Oh, but it is clever! The little country
village of Sunningwater, with its world
over types, Mrs. Grundy, Mrs. Bulsom-
Porter; the incarnate spirit of compro
mise, Canon Bonsey; the law legal, Sir
Daniel Carteret; the beautiful sinner who
has committed the crime of being found
out, Mrs. Dane; the youthful idealist.
Lionel Carteret; the ingenue. Janet Col
quhoun; the kindly woman of the world,
Lady Eastner, who achieves Christ-like
ness through what Canon Bonsey would
term her latidudinarian views, and the
old, old rest of them.
All portraits these, drawn with a few
sure, strong touches, with never a false 1
tone or accent throughout, and posed in
the "picture with an inspired sense of dra
matic light and shade. Quite devoid of
theatricalism Is "Mrs. Dane's Defence,
but withal intensely dramatic, with the
drama largely played by the audience, ex
cept in the wonderful third act. The play
wright, with a positive genius of direct
ness, plunges Immediately into the heart
of his subject, placing his audience en
rapport with the story right from the be
ginning, and from the beginning to the
endâ no! the end is anti-climaxâ but almost
to the end. holds them with caught breath
and a pull at the heart.
Mrs. Dane is a woman with a pastâ the
usual kind of pastâ beautiful, rich, young,
charming, who has come to the village of
Sunntngwater to "live it down," her own
memory of. It only, for it is known to no
one there. Being what she is, and without
visible ancestry, she arouses the jealousy
and suspicion of Sunningwater's society
leader, Mrs. Bulsom-Porter, who is every
thing that Mrs. Dane is not.

wPERSONAL MENTION.
IT was announced in the Berlin cables several weeks ago that Emperor "Will
iam has commenced to let his beard grow and that he now, more than ever,
bore a striking resemblance to his father. The Call Is able to present a pic
ture of the German ruler, showing how he looks Â¦with hla latest hirsute adorn
ment. The Emperor, in May of last year, began to modify somewhat the fierce
upward twist of his mustache, which he reduced to an angle of forty-five degrees.
About the same time he dismissed the imperial barber, Haby, who is said to have
become impudent and to have presumed to trade on his supposed' friendly rela
tions with the Emperor. It was also said then that the Emperor was about to
let his beard grow, and German barbers were in despair, for the fashion of wear
ing beards would become general and mean a loss of millions of marks to the
knights of the razor throughout the Empire. Emperor "William carried out his
determination, however, and now the barber fold of the Fatherland are kept

extent, and thus the movement toward reform has
been actually started. Doubtless the adoption of 7 a
system of taxation similar, to that in France would
prove advantageous in limiting the evil as well as in
bringing in a considerable revenue to the community.
At any rate the persistency with which the Eastern
press is urging. the reform gives assurance that a
strong public sentiment will soon^be developed in
favor of it. When that sentiment is aroused a means
will-be found to rid the country and the cities of a
nuisance" which has been already too long tolerated.
It may be^.long time before American landscapes
and American cities are redeemed, from- the bill
posting and fence advertising nuisance, but sooner or
later the reform will be accomplished. Steps have
been already taken to restrict the nuisance to some
From Philadelphia a simila- complaint comes. The
Times says any American who returns home from a
prolonged sojourn abroad will-be struck by the great
number of advertising signS that desecrate every
available space, and by_ way of .abating the nuisance
it advocates the adoption in. Pennsylvania . of the
French system of taxing such forms of advertising.
"It-is a valuable privilege," says the Times, "in the
nature of a franchise like that which is given out. to
authorize the use of the streets by a railroad company
and other permits that bring benefits to private indi
viduals. It is worth. money to an advertiser to put up
a notice of his wares in a public place where thou
sands of people may see<it. Furthermore, it is in the
interest of dignity, art and an undefiled landscape that
these pasters and painters should not go about over
the face of the earth with a free hand."
The effect of unlimited bill-posting and fence adver
tising has been a renewal of the agitation in the East
for the enactment of laws to prevent any further per
petration of the nuisance. The New York Sun in
commenting upon the evil in and around the city says
illuminated signs have been placed along the Pali
sades, that the Brooklyn Bridge seems to exist only
for the sake of serving as. a framework on, which to
hang the names of all sorts of articles of commerce,
and that electric light advertising has reached the
limit or^ Broadway. It adds: "It is reasonable to
resent anything which takes from the beauty of a
piece of scenery, or anything which takes from the
dignity of a city's principal thoroughfare. If we have
the right to protection from discomforting noise, why
should we not have some protection from what jars
us through the sense of sight?"
WHEN the French were preparing for "the
Paris Exposition of 1900 they sought to add
to the attractiveness not only of their," capi
tal'but of their whole country by strictly forbidding
anything in the way of bill-posting mrisances^either
around the exposition, grounds or about the stations
of the railways by^which visitors reached the city.' In
that way they furnished the civilized world with an
example of reform that was widely commented upon
and did much to encourage the figKt against such
nuisances elsewhere. In Buffalo something like an
opposite course appears to have been pursued, and
as a result the poster advertising around Niagara
Falls is said to have been carried to such an extent
as to seriously detract from the enjoyment of the
visitors. *' *

people die, and consequently one of the proofs that
may. be required of a- crank who asserts that a pesti

some one has died of it in that locality.

Travelers are not shunning the city, arid but for an

Knowing how thoroughly, the United States is coy^

its Existence could not be suppressed. Thus the Bos

ONE of the curiosities of the silly season in the

persons who ought to know better are repeat

throughout the country. These cranks, for they de
serve no better title, have lately taken to declaring
that the authorities in this city-have combined in a
sort of conspiracy to suppress the truth, and upon
that declaration they build up much lofty and seem

A LONG-LIVED FALSEHOOD.

/^> IXCE the renewal of the French vineyards by
stocks from California that are ; resistant of
phylloxera, the crop has so enormously in
creased that prices have fallen below any possible
profit. The vineyardists complain, however, that the
increased yield is accompanied by a decreased mar
ket, and that California,- taking advantage of the
shortage in past years caused by the destruction of
the French vineyards, has occupied their market.
We have not at hand statistics to prove or disprove
this contention, but we assume that the Frenchmen
know what they are talking about. It must mean that
California has taken possession of the wine and
brandy market in this country and Great Britain, and,
perhaps, to an extent, in Central and South
America and Russia. We are aware that California
vintners have recently complained of the bad state of
their market, but they attribute it to the "brickyard
vineyards" of the Lake Erie region, Missouri and
Central New York. But this complaint, if justifiable,
only shows -that American wine-drinkers are using
the American product in preference to the foreign,
and are tricked into patronizing the blended and re
inforced artificial wines of the East for lack of
knowledge of what wine really is.
The only genuine wine grapes grown in this coun
try are grown in California. A wine grape must have
in the fruit all of the elements required in a finished
Wine, the sugar, the acid and, if red wine, the color
and grape tannin. Nothing need be added to give
the v.ine all the qualities required by the user. The
Eastern grapes have neither the sugar nor the color
-required. They are tteated with syrup and get their
color for aniline dyes. As they lack sugar they fall
below the antiseptic percentage of alcohol, which is
supplied by corn high wines. If short in tannin they
are filled with oak tannin. The grapes supply some
acid and the juice necessary to fermentation, and that
fs about all..
The California vintners can help their domestic
trade by publishing widely a plain statement of facts
about wine, what it is, how made, and the necessary
elements for its excellence, which must exist in the
grape and cannot be supplied I from other sources
without injuring the wholesomeness of the product.
The Hammondsport (N. Y.) wines, grown on
Keuka Lake, and the Ohio wines from KeMy's Island,
had quite a hold in the Eastern market before Cali
fornia began exporting. The great headway made by
our wines was against their competition, at the out
set, and it would seem that there is nothing in their
competition now that should seriously bar the
progress of our vintage.
Having secured a market by the superior quality
of our vintage, it can be held only by rightly observ
ing the principles of commercial honor, and sending
out only sound, aged and finished wines. If our
vintners attempt to meet the competition of sophis
ticated wines by sophisticating, they will make a mis
take that means their final ruin. . â¢-.Â¦
â¢ A movement has been started in the East to. present
a loving cup to Admiral .Cervera in recognition of his
kindness to Lieutenant Hobson when that dashing
young officer was taken prisoner at Santiago, and it
is to be hoped the, scheme will go through.' Amid the
rivalries and bitternesses of commerce it is pleasant
to find the fighters doing the fraternal act.
' The people of Europe never realized the largeness
of the United States until recent events directed their
attention to the fact that it is big enough. to hold
Rockefeller and' Morgan. at the same time.
THE FRENCH VINE-GROWERS.
We agree with Rosebery and Cambon, and defend
the American teacher against Professor Russell's
harmful ascription and the brutal phraseology in
which it is expressed.
The French Embassador, Jules Cambon, in a re
'cent speech at Chicago said: "America's magnificent
public school system and its host of well equipped and
richly endowed colleges and seminaries are the best
guarantees the nation possesses, or can possess, of 'its**'
future peace and stability. More than its inexhaust
ible mines of gold and iron, more than its vast and
ever-increasing number of -manufactories and railway
systems, its agricultural resources and other wealth
producing agencies, do these public schools and other
institutions of learning stand for the things that prom
ise strength, perpetuity and tranquillity to the Ameri
can republic. - The teacher is, after all, the greatest
of peacemakers. Breadth of view, refined sensibili
ties, enlarged sympathy, lofty and ennobling senti
ment, a higher range of thought and feelingâ all these
and other things developed by a true/ educational
process count against a resort to the cruelties and
barbarities of war." Â¦:
A vast majority of the millions of Americans have
come to manhood and womanhood through the pub
lic schools. If their training have been by teachers
narrow, bigoted and incompetent, then the national
character has been narrowed and bigotized. Instead
of a broad and strong people, as the world believes
us to be, we are a narrow and weak people. Our
rivals in the industrial^ world, who have critically ex
amined us, in a search for the cause of our strength
and industrial supremacy, have frankly; declared that
.it is in the public school training of our people, lead
ing to their high level of intelligence, their faultless
initiative, their individual independence. It is con
ceded that we make mistakes, but .they are the mis
takes of the strong and broad, not of the v narrow and
weak. Lord Rosebery has said that the salvation of
industrial England must be sought in the introduc
tion there of our American public school system.
Other English thinkers have taken the same posi
tion, and their attitude is so significant that it is be
lieved it foreshadows the next issue in English poli
tics. Can it be possible that all other observers, at
home and abroad, are wrong and this Columbian
pundit is right?
The trouble with Professors Russell and Wendell
seems to be a fondness for calling names and making
snoots at those who in good faith have sought their
classes to be instructed. All men know that it is
an infirmity of narrow and bigoted men to think
others to be as they are.
In such a situation the teachers and the public
have a right to know what painful experiences in his
career led Professor Russell to his conclusion. '
Professor Russell says that his damnifying conclu
sion is "the product of long thought and experience."
But Horace Mann had long thought and experience
and reached no such conclusion. Other educators,
whose eminence made them known to the public,
reached the opposite conclusion.
The qualities of narrowness, bigotry and incom
petency must be shown in methods, practices and
habits, in deed and in action. What acts of teachers,
as a class, -betray these qualities?
What he has said. and classically calls "a shake up"
does no good at all. On the contrary, it does harm.
It plants the seeds of distrust and suspicion in the
minds of the millions of parents whose children are
in the schools. It makes every. teacher's task harder
and more difficulty It makes the taxpayers less pa
tient in supporting the public schools. It hardens the
hoof of tyranny on the part of shallow school boards,
entrusted with brief authority, and is the cause of
evil, and evil only.
Professor Russell states only a conclusion, and that
in language that is offensive. He is unknown to the
general public of this State, the West and the Union.
A man must have established reputation for wisdom,
for good judgment, in order -to secure acceptance of
his conclusions without premise or argument.
We submit that his method of shaking them up
has in it no leading to reform, if reform be necessary.
The indictment of teachers, as a class, as incompetent
does no good. The professor's statement, if it have
any merit, must be based upon observed facts. In
our judgment a statement of those facts, without other
characterization, would be useful to teachers as a
class. Such a statement of facts would be his pre
mise and could be examined and validated or inval
idated, and his^ conclusion could be justified or over
thrown. The inquiry should be'What do teachers do,
and how, that exhibits their narrowness, .bigotry and
incompetency? . .
WE again hail Columbia and its Doctor of
Pedagogics, Professor James. Earl Russell.
Since his public declaration, to a class of
teachers in' the- Berkeley summer school, that their
profession is narrow and bigoted, he appears in an
interview in which he" adheres manfully to his state
ment and adds to it by saying: "I mean to say that
the teachers of the United States, as a class, are nar
row, bigoted and incompetent. .The solution of the
problem lies in the teachers themselves, and the first
step is to shake them' up and tell them frankly their
faults."

BeecJal Dispatch to The. Call.
Mrs. Petersen, hearing the noise, ran
Into the room with her three-months-old
i infant In her arms. Seeing her husband
being assaulted, and fearful that he
might be killed she ran between the men.
Turning toward her husbajid. she saw his
bloody and.bruised face, head and neck.
The shock was so great that she screamed
and fell in a faint, with the baby clinging
to her. This Incident stopped further as
sault.
- Upon being placed in bed Mrs. Peter
sen became hysterical, and began scream-
Ing. "Help for my husband.'who is being
murdered by Farley." This alarmed the
latter, Â¦ who hastily left. He went for a
doctor and sent him, to .the Petersen
house. It is said that he then left the
town. â¢
Reports received later to-night are to
the effect that Petersen is badly bruised,
about the head, his eyes are black and
blue and closed and his face is badly cut.
He is a small man and bears an excellent
reputation. Mrs. Petersen is 'reported
very low . from extreme nervous prostra
tion from which she has suffered since
the assault, and the attending physician-

When the news reached Salinas much

be lodged against Farley. â¢

The last four of the striking steel workers
who were arrested Saturday, charged with riot,
were released from Jail late this afternoon up

afraid to serve the warrants. Henry B.
Henderson,- a potter for whom the police have
a warrant, haa been trying to get himself in

arrest him, but they will not do It for the
reason that Henderson .Is backed by the Na

the officers fear the vengeance of the potters,
once they are aroused, as they would be If one
of their number were put under arrest. Sec

"The sacred territory of the fatherland
has been invaded by an army of Colom

Rangel Garbiras, and they have entered
by Urena and San Antonio. In announc

and peace of the republic. I fulfill my duty
as the man primarily responsible for the
fate of Venezuela, and inform you that
all necessary measures have been already
taken to repel this grave attempt. In
order, therefore, to facilitate the exercise
of my discretional authority as command
er in chief of the Venezuelan army, and
at the same time to enable me to fulfill
my duties as President of the republic,
the national executive has made use of
the power conferred on it by the national
constitution and has suspended those per
sonal guarantees the exercise ' of which
may be incompatible with the defense of
public order. â¢
Castro's False Proclamation.
The Government Is trying to make the
public believe that Â¦ the movement is an
invasion of Venezuela by Colombia. This
is not the case, but if it were it would be
regarded by the people as a just recom
pense of General Castro's hostile policy
against Colombia, especially when it is
remembered that only a few weeks ago
General Uribe-Uribe, chief of the Colom
bian revolution, was transported from
Curacao to Maracaibo on the Venezuelan
warship Zumbador. This fact alone will
throw a deal of light on the condition of
affairs.
The Government has' sent 10,000 troops
against General Garbiras. who is invoking
the name of "El Mocho," the famous Gen

CURACAO, Venezuela, Aug.. 5.â A for
midable insurrection, if we are to believe
the Government itself, has broken out
against the dictatorship of General Cas
tro. The movement, which was inaugu
rated on the trontier of Tachira en the
night of July 25, is healed by Dr. Rar.gel
Garfciras, who was preyident of Congress
when Dr. Rojas Paul was President of the
Repub'ic, then Venezuelan Minister, to
Spain and later President of the State of

Special Dispatch. to The Call.
PITTSBURG, Aug. 5.â -Just a faint
glimmer of hope that the great steel
workers' strike would be settled was em
bodied In a statement given out by Pres
ident Shaffer of the "Amalgamated Asso
ciation to-night. When asked if he would
pursue the same policy In ordering a
strike In the mills of the Federal Steel,
the National Steel 'and the National Tube
Companies as he did in calling out the
men In the mills' of the "American Tin
Plate Company he replied: "If It had not
been for this determination on my part,
the general strike would bave.been or
dered on Saturday night." ' .:â¢
Before calling out the tin workers, and
after falling to get any satisfaction from
the officials of the American Sheet Tin
Company â¢ and the American Steel Hoop
Company, President Shaffer sent a tele
gram to Vice President Warner Arms of
the American Tin Plate Company, notify
ing him that under article 19, section 35,
of the constitution of the Amalgamated
Association, he would be obliged to call
out the tin workers in all of the mills
owned by the United States Steel Corpor
ation unless the difficulty was settled
within a period of ten days. As a resuit
of this notice Arms succeeded in getting
together another conference, and a vain
attempt was made to settle the dispute
and prevent a strike which would involve
the tin mills. That conference was the
one that broke up in the Hotol Lincoln
three weeks ago last Saturday.
In order to be equally fair to the other
constituent companies of the United
States Steel Corporation and -accord them
the same treatment President Shaffer has
sent a similar notice to the officers of the
Federal Steel Company, the National
Steel Company and the National Tube
Company, giving them the same time in
which to make any effort they may desire
to bring about a settlement, or he will
put In force this same clause in the Amal
gamated constitution. It is presumed
that the delay in issuing the general order
will be at least until the end of the pres
ent week. In the meantime the men in
the mills of these three companies will
be prepared to come out when the strike
order is issued.
The possibility of a settlement of the
strike Is based on the bare hope that the
officials of the three additional companies
will bring to bear sufficient influence to
urge an adjustment of the difficulty before
the strike order is issued. President Shaf
fer did not express any hope that this
would be done, nor did he even discuss
the matter, but the Inference was quickly
seen that there was such a probability in
sight. It is a faint one, though, and but
little interest was taken In it in the gen
eral offices of the association to-day.
Regarding the publication of charges
that the Amalgamated Association would
be violating contracts with the constituent
companies of the trust, with which they
had signed scales for the present year,
President Shaffer said that all contracts
and scales are signed at all times sub
ject to the provisions of the constitution
of the Amalgamated Association. This
constitution was in the hands of all the
officials of all the companies affected or
likely to be affected and they are fully
aware of the provisions that it contains
for this very difficulty.
Just a Faint Hope That the Difficulty
Will Be Adjusted.

"I then took the baby and went to the
earn and sat there awhile and then went
in and put the baby in the cradle and was
tryinsr to put him to sleep. The baby
started to cry, Frank was outside and
when he heard baby crying started to
come in. at the same time calling the baby
vile names. I then ran in to where the
rifle was. I -was so scared and excited
that when I saw him trying to get his
knife out of his belt, I grabbed up the rifle
lying on the bed and. pointing it at him.
pulled the trigger. He fell without a
word. Then I went to my mother's. He
had threatened my life many times before
and I killed him in self-defense."
Frank I_ Trimmin, a neighbor, corrob
orated Mrs. Wellman's storv. Sheriff
Holburn and Coroner Dixon arrived Mon
day from Riverside. The Coroner's Jury
pave as a verdict that the deceased died
from a rifle shot fired by his wife in self
flefens=e. Public ODinion exonerates Mrs.
"U'ellman from at! blame, in view of the
dead man's past character. Mrs. Wellman
is a flne shot with a rifle, having handled
firearms all her married life.
BuUet^Ends His Threats,
"Ever' since my little girl was born
about three years ago our trouble began.
He was jealous and was always threaten
ing my life. He pulled my hair and
abused me repeatedly when drunk. Sun
day he drew a knife on me and said he
would kill both baby and me. He wanted
to separate and I agreed on condition that
he place our little Mary where I could
have access to her. He said he knew he
could not have her by law but nothing
could prevent his stealing the child. Later
he refused to separate and told me to go
down to tny mother's, a distance of two
miles.
"I picked up the baby and took Mary by
the hand and started down the road to
my mother's. Then he pulled his gun and
made me come back- I returned and
Ftoo-l by him in the door. He said: 'For
two cents I would cut your throat and the
baby's.' He had been abusing the baby
all the morning, choking it until it grew
black in the face. Every time he looked
at the baby he would run to him and slap
him In the face. He threatened to kill me
and the children and then go down to
ray mother's and kill father, mother and
my sisters and brothers and any one else
who might come in his way. and then take
his own life. I was outdoors when he
called me in. He had a 22-caliber rifle in
his hands. He made me sit down beside
.him en the bed. Being quiet a moment or
two, he looked around and then shot at
a fowl in the yard.
Story of the Young Wife.
There is little regret felt because of his
death. He had been a desperado for years
in this locality and was once a companion
of Charles Marshall, who is serving a life
sentence in San Quentln for two murders.
Wellman was a decent fellow when sober,
but drink made a. demon of him and he
terrori_ed the mountain ranchers and
their families by riding by and firing re
volvers at their homes. Saturday, August
3. Wellman was drunk and abusive and
Sunday morning- found him still In an in
toxicated state. His wife, whom he mar
ried when she was 13 years old and who
is now but 19, tells the following story:
SAN JACINTO. Aug. 5.â Frank P. Well
man, a cattle rancher of the San Jacinto
Mountains, aged 42 years, was fatally shot
by his wife. Clara A. Wellman. yesterday
morning. The shooting was done in self
defense, as Wellman had been drunk for
several days on pure alcohol and had sev
eral times threatened his wife's life. Well
inan was shot through the heart and died
instantly.

If any such action is taken by the fed

such as to call for any action by the led
eration It Is probable that he will call a
meeting of the general council soon after
his return. .
This statement was made .to-day by
Frank Morrison, secretary of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, in reply to a
question as to whether it was probable
that a sympathetic strike would be or
dered by the federation. Morrison would
not make any direct statement as to the
probability of a sympathetic strike being
ordered, saying that the Federation of
Labor would take up questions as they
arose and deal with them in a business
like manner; v V
the American Federation of La
bor will use every effort to prevent injury
to the Interests of any, member of the
Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel
and Tin Workers. Any industrial disturb
ance that may occur will be because of
the antagonism of the trust to universally
concede rights of wage-earners to organize
for their protection /and to secure im
proved conditions."
GALL, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON,. Aug. 5.â
"If the trust continues to- oppose
the organization of wage-earners
are to the effect that the mine workers'
will refuse to furnish coal for the trust
coke furnaces or mills. An ordinance has
been drawn by Common Councilman
James M. Waumpler of the Fourth Ward
appropriating $500,000 for additional pav
ing and sewer work in McKeesport. Only
taxpayers are to be employed at the work.
It is Intended for the benefit. of the strik
ers in case the struggle is prolonged. La
bor leaders will bring great pressure to
bear on Councilmen to have the ordinance
passed. It would furnish work for most
of the strikers for almost a year.

LONDON, Aug. 5.â The naval maneuvers

The final result* have not yet been given
out, but the defenders are known to have
lost a dozen cruisers, two" gunboats and
eight torpedo-boat destroyers. Â¦ The enemy
lost only three cruisers, three torpedo-boat
destroyers and three torpedo-boats, while
they captured an endless number of mer

practical confirmation of the justness of
the criticism to which the Admiralty has
recently been subjected.

Conflict Lasts Seventeen Days, Insurgents
Exhausting Ammunition and the Govern
ment Troops Too Badly Cut Up to Pursue
NEW YORK. Aug. 5.â A. Diaz Guer
rera, agent in this city of the Co
lombian revolutionists, to-day re
ceived information from trusted
agents who had reached .Venezu
ela that a -bloody battle : was fought _.t
Palo Negro in the latter part of May. The
conflict lasted seventeen days. The bat
tle was di awn at the. end. of that period,
the insurgents! retiring 1 when' their Â« am
munition was exhausted,* the Government
troops being too badly cut up to pursue
the revolutionists. â¢ â¢
By the Red L> liner Philadelphia, which
arrived here to-day from Venezuela, Agent
Guerrera received a budget of information
in the form of reports, cablegrams and
letters from th_ scene of hostilities. These
stated that General Benjamin Herrera,
who is attacking from the Pacific side, is
preparing in the department of Cauca;
General Argila, who is advancing from
the Atlantic, is in the department of San
tander and is in possession of Ocana City;
Generals A. Castillo and Clodmlro Castillo
have effected a junction of their forces
and are at El Valle, in the department of
Magdalena, and General Marin has. fought
an important battle at Jirardot, in the de
partment of Cundinamarca, which is in
the interior of the country, about 100 miles
from Bogota, the capital of Colombia. Im
portant and successful engagements have
been fought by General Herrera at Tuinco
and Barbacos,. and other Insurgent vic
tories, are reported from the southeastern
portion of the department of Cauca. A
great revolutionary army is said to be op
erating on the Pacific side of Colombia.
Information which came to Agent Guer
rera via . Mara caibo states 'that Senor
Valencia is on his way to Cucuta to take
charge of the Government forces on the
â¢frontier, and that at Bogota the mer
chants, not wishing to handle any more
paper money, have closed their stores,
and that business throughout the country
is at a standstill.
Senor Guerrera says that he has not for
some time received any information con
cerning the whereabouts of General
Uribe-Uribe, who has been appointed by
General Vargas Santos in supreme com
mand of the insurgent army. Continuing
he said: â¢ 'vj-.-s
â¢General' Uribe Is a personal friend of Gen
eral Castro, the President of Venezuela. They
have known each other for years. Castro
lived for ' a time in* Colombia and his wife is
a Colombian. The friendship and recent meet
ing . between Castro and General Urlbe at
Caracas has no significance in a revolutionary
eense. The Colombian Government . officials,
however, charge that President Castro has been
openly opposing the . insurgents, but such is not
the case. I don't think he sympathizes with

betrayed a yielding tendency from the opening
until the closing of business. Resultant losses
ran from two to six point? for the Ftocks most
actively dealt In and included leading members
of all principal grroupg. Occasional rallies
were unavailing In checking the steady stream
of liquidation and the professional element
utilized everj' temporary recovery to put out
additional short lines of stocks. Western and
Pacific stocks bore the brunt of the selling In
the railroad quarter, while United States Steel
and Surar were In the van in the downward
movement of the specialties. The failure to
effect a Feitlement of tjie steel strike on Satur
day prepared operators for a resumption of
liquidation in the steel issues at the opening of
business to-day. First sales of the common
Â¦u-<?rp 15,000 shares at from 41 down to 40%,
Â¦which about measured the low point until well
In the sfternoon. when it sagged to 40. Inter
mediate transactions were on a narrow frac
tional range, but the fact that the stock was
â¢well backed ud arcund 40 did not exert any
strengthening effect on the general market. The
closing price was the lowest of the day and
indlca.ted a net loss of 3% points, as compared
with Saturday's close. The preferred stock
Euffered an extreme loss of ZVÂ» and ended three
points off. The street was inclined to view the
failure to reach an agreement as foreshadow
ing a highly sensitive market for the stock for
awhile. Other metal properties scored marked
sympathetic losses, Tennessee Coal dipping 3%
and American Car and Foundry preferred four
points. Selling by the West continued in eplte
of rezortM of rains in various sections of the
corn belt and the publication of a large number
of very satisfactory increases in railroad earn
ings for the fourth week of July. Sugar wag a
prominent feature all day and dropped B3i to
139% on sales by the professionals who argued
that the forthcoming opposition would make
large Inroads on its earning capacity. But
little news was circulated to account for the
tcute weakness of many 'stocks and thr selling
,n-as attributed in part to liquidation by holders
Â¦who have become tired out by the recent steady
drop of prices. A holiday at London deprived

A dispatch from Chicago to Bolton. de Ruyter
& Co. says that the twenty-two mills In Min
neapolis are working day and night to catch
up on orders for Flour. The entire output for
two months has been sold, and the weekly
grind now averages 330,000 barrels. It Bcenis>
that the domestic trade has been holding off
for a decline, and is now buying. European
holdings have also been large and when these
are worked off a big business Is expected from
that quarter. Millers are generally looking for
higher prices for Flour.

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
CHICAGO, Aug. 5.â September wheat opened
unchanged to %c higher .at 69%@69%c under
buying orders and an advance at Paris. Trade
was very dull for a time, however, and an
easier tone in corn found Its reflection In
wheat, which worked off to 6S%@63%c during
the first half-hour. Seaboard clearances were
again reported as heavy, while offerings from
first hands In the West were said to be light.
While gloomy tidings of the condition of the
corn crop had no marked effect In the pit
where maize for futuro delivery Is handled. It
was accepted by wheat traders as emphasizing
the bullishness of the wheat position. A fair
sized short Interest was driven to cover, Sep
tember advancing to 70%c. On profit-taking
the market fell back -slightly, but held strong
September closing l%i over Saturday at 70%c.
The corn market opened steady, but ruled
easy for a time thereafter because of general
showers West, as well as favorable tempera
tures. Crop reports came in with the usual
tone of despondency uninterrupted. Damage
is now claimed In Illinois and Iowa. The
market rallied on these reports, the close be
ing %c over Saturday at 57%c for September.
Trade In oats was moderately active, but
was mostly done by pit professionals. Sep
tember closed a shade down at 35c. â¢

of a purely professional character being done.

Mail advices from New York say: "Con
sumptive trade in dried fruits was of fair pro
portions and the market generally was steady
and unchanged. Prunes were firm on the spot
et about Uc higher prices than were quoted
a week ago, while the situation on the coast
vas said to be stronger, the Cured Fruit As
sociation having withdrawn quotations. The
large sizes of prunes were scarce on the spot
and In good request. Sizes 70-SOs and S0-90s
Â¦were little wanted, but there is quite an ac
tive trade in 90-100s at 3'i(f 3Â»ic. Three-crown
loots raisins were a little firmer on reports
that the Cured Fruit Association has disposed
cf its holdings of three-crown to the packers.
Only a small trade is doing in spot raisins.
Currants continue dun at no further change
in quotations. Evaporated apples are firm and
unchanged. New crop evaporated were easier,
buyers showing considerably less disposition
to take hold. Small fruits were quiet."

the market of Its usual cue as to the attitude
of the foreign speculators toward the develop
ments over Sunday. The large expansion in the
loan item of Saturday's bank statement was
commented on to-day but not adequately ex
plained. The Increase Is believed to be due to
various corporate financing now in progress. .
Money rates were easy all day and the sub
treasury paid out a million dollars, on gold
receipts at Pacific Coast points. As the session
drew to a close the pressure against the stock
market increased and the lowest prices of the
day were made in the final dealings. Reports
were current that United States Steel comnifn
and preferred were to be held at 40 and 90 re
epectiully,- but the preferred nevertheless broke
to 89%. The Immense dealings in the stocks were
made within a range of a point, comparing the
opening and closing prices of the day. Rail
road stocks covered a range of two points.
Railroad bonds were fairly active but weak
in sympathy with stocks. Total sales, par
value, $2,250,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on

The original tunnel road scheme was
started some* twenty years ago by L. W.
Kennedy, who organized a tollroad com
pany under the name of the Oakland and
Contra Costa Road and Tunnel Company.
There was very little money put up, but
in spite of this Kennedy managed to get
the road graded to the summit of the
ridge, built several bridges' and bored a
few hundred feet of tunnel, until a sudden
flow of water washed things out. Then
the road was attached for both material
and wages and was sold out by the Sher
iff. Those who bought the rights did not
attempt to carry on the work, and it has
remained without attention untllan act
was secured from the last Legislature per
mitting counties to build tunnels on Inter
i county roads. - â¢ . . â¢
This claim of Renton, Holmes & Co. will
necessitate an examination Into the ques
tion of rights. The owners of the prop
erty through which the road was built
claim that they did not agree to surrender
any right of way to. the old company until
the road should have been completed, and
they stand ready to give a right of way
to Alameda County.
The matter has been referred to Dis
trict Attorney. Allen and the Road and
Bridge Committee to determine where the
county stands in the matter. Â¦
Meanwhile there will be a meeting be
tween County Surveyor Brown of Contra
Costa County and Acting Surveyor Prath
er of Alameda County next Tuesday to
run the level for the tunnel. Supervisor
Stowe of Contra Costa County has se
cured deeds from Mr. Buckley for the
right of way on his side of the hills and
already has men at work on the old Ken
nedy grade clearing it up and putting it
in shape. The Alameda County viewers
expect to report to the Supervisors in two
weeks. â¢ .Â¦ ' .'"'
Dear Sir: Havlne noticed recently In the
Oakland papers that steps are again to be
taken to carry out the tunnel project between
Alameda and Contra Costa counties, and that
the tunnel is to be extended and the work
carried on as originally undertaken by the Oak
land - and Contra Costa Tunnel Company, we
now beg leave to call your attention to the
fact that we acquired all the right*, privileges
and rights of way heretofore held by the Oak
land and Contra Costa Tunnel Company. We
were forced Into taking over its property rights
through furnishing materials to the original
company which they failed to pay for. We will
be pleased to dispose of our rights in this
business to your Board of Supervisors on most
reasonable terms, and we 'will be pleased to
treat with you to that end. We remain, re
epectiully yours, RENTON, HOLMES & CO.
The Board of Supervisors has struck an
obstacle to the construction of the tunnel
road between Alameda and Contra Costa
counties in the shape of a claim from
those who allege that they hold the rights
of way and privileges of the original Oak
land and Contra. Costa Road and Tunnel
Company. A letter was sent to the Board
of Supervisors this morning by Renton,
Holmes & Co. of San Francisco, In which
that firm claims it holds all the rights of
the original company and it will be
pleased to sell the same to the county of
Alameda. The letter is as follows:

LONDON, Aug. 5.â Although no division

that no further attempt will be made to
pass it, either this session or the ne.xt.
Lord Salisbury, the Premier, referring to
the statement of Catholic peers, said the
Government now realized that the Catho
lics did not -wish the offensive words of
the original declaration to be, withdrawn
unless the Government at the same time
withdrew the declaration regarding the
security of the Protestant succession. The
Government never had . the slightest In
tention of withdrawing that. The Cath
olics regretted that they must be pre
pared to see the declaration stand in Its
present form.

Interior Braces Were Bent.

eral ot her interior brace* were bent
through the terriflc strain. The new

CHICAGO, Aug. 5â After a visit to
President McKInleyat Canton, Senator
Cullom says there is not likely to be any
general tariff legislation next winter, but
that some of the * pendlnff commercial
treaties ought to pass the Senate.
Asked as to the story that Senator
Hanna had gone to Canton to get aid
from the President in settling the steel
strike. Senator Cullom said: f Â¦
"I' know there is nothing in that re
port. Senator Hanna. President McKin
ley and myself talked of the strike as we
did of other matters of public interest,
but there was no suggestion from Senator
Hanna at any time that he was mixing
up in the matter at all."
Speaking of , the action likely to.be taken
by Congress at the next session, Senator
Cullom said:
"We shall have to. enact some legisla
tion regarding the* Philippines, but not
much, I think. Porto Rico is now all dis
posed of and there is nothing to do for
it. As far as Cuba is concerned, it has
accepted the American proposals, and we
have nothing more to do than to let it
alone and allow it" to Â¦work out its own
salvation. From all the information I can
get, the feeling is growing stronger in
Cuba every day in favor of final annexa
tion., to this country. â¢ It will grow
stronger and stronger as the Cubans find
their neighbors in Porto Rico enjoying the
benefits of free trade with this country,
which they are debarred from." .
"What prospect is there of tariff legis
lation' by Congress next winter?" was
asked of the Senator. â¢ . . â¢
"I do not think there will .be any, at
least In the form of a general revision of
the tariff. Of course I am not In a posi
tion to speak authoritatively for the Pres
ident,-but I feel I am representing his
ideas when I say that.
"There are, however, some things we
ought to do which will amount to a par
tial revision of the tariff. There are at
present pending before the Senate some
ten commercial treaties. Â¦â¢â¢ These treaties
are all of a reciprocity character and . if
they are ratified will amount to a change
In the tariff with the countries with which
they are made. It seems to me as if it
would be wise to ratify, at least some of
them. A feeling has grown abroad that
the: United States Is disposed to act in
what may be called a hoggish manner in
its trade relations, and if these Â¦ reciproc
ity treaties can be drawn so as to be for
the mutual advantage of both countries
entering into them, I think it would be
beneficial all around."

' appointment as veterinarian of
the agricultural college of the
University of California, a new position
recently created by the Board of Regents.
For ten years the faculty of the agricul

dairy school, buildings for which are now
in the course of construction. Â¦Â¦â¢'

Miss Hooper is the youngest daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. C. A. Hooper, her father
being the millionaire lumber merchant.
She is an accomplished musician and is a
great favorite in society on both sides of
the bay.
Two years ago Mr. Crosby was gradu
ated with the class of '99 at Harvard Uni
versity. His father is very, wealthy, and
the family Is one of the oldest in Boston.
There is a little touch of romance in the
story of the young couples' love affair.
While Miss Hooper was at finishing school
in Boston she met Mr. Crosby, and in the
course of events they, discovered that
their fathers had been school friends
many years ago. Before Miss Hooper re
turned to her home she was an engaged
girl.
Preparations for the Hooper-Crosby
wedding 1 have been going on for some
time. It will take place in the new Hooper
residence overlooking the bay at the
southerly end of Hawthorne street. The
ceremony will be performed at the fash
ionable hour of 2 o'clock. Rev Dr. Mac
kenzie of the First Presbyterian Church
of San Francisco, an old friend of the
family, will be the officiating clergyman.
The wedding will be a simple affair.
Neither bride nor groom will be attended.

friends the only witnesses of the marriage
will be the relatives of the young people.
Afterward they will go on a wedding trip
that will have for its termination Boston,

ALAMEDA, Aug. 5.â The City Trustees
to-night adopted a series of resolutions
requesting Secretary of War Root not to
hold up the tidal canal contracts, and
ordered them telegraphed to the secretary
at once. The city of Alameda Is vitally
interested in the completion of this canal,
for the half finished work is a menace toi
the health of the city.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Aug. 5.
United States Senator George C. Per
kins and Congressman "Victor H. Metcalf
have united in demanding the completion
of the. tidal canal and the Immediate ap
proval of the contract that has been held
up In Washington. This contract was ap
proved by the United States engineers In
San Francisco,, and believing that ap
proval would certainly be indorsed at
Washington the contractors have much of
'their material on the ground
This leaves things in a very peculiar
and embarrassing condition. The South

all of the earth that 13 to be removed
from the tidal canal and has laid an elab
orate series of tracks to convey it from
the point of excavation to a fill that is be
ing made at West Oakland for the estab

mand wired to Washington to-day is as
follows:

earnestly urge Immediate approval of contract
for Oakland harbor tidal canal. The work
was authorized by Congress, money appropri

railroad company paid fifty thousand dollars
for its right of way, Sauaal Creek diverted,
and some of the excavatine done. Work was
commenced on Oakland harbor in 1874, and we
feel that there should be no further delay,
especially as your department promised us dur
ing the last session of Congress that the work
should be Immediately prosecuted to a final
completion. GEORGE C. PERKINS.

My dear brother, do not lay this matter
aside. Let not the liquor men win in this
battle because \re remain silent. May the voice
of the Christian people ring out in unmistaken
terms, showing the Increased and Increasing
potency of the forces that make for righteous
ness and peace. Tours for the overthrow of
the liquor traffic.
ERNEST E. BAKER,
President State Anti-Saloon League of North
ern California.
In accordance with the request the con-
PTegations of the First Methodist, the
First Congregational and the First Pres
byterian churches have given formal ex
pression to their support of the league
movement.
The first move on the part of the league
to give public expression to its sentiment
and purpose has been to send out to all
of the clergymen of this city a letter
which is to be presented to all of the
congregations hereabout as soon as the
communications have been received.
The letter is signed by Dr. Baker in his
capacity as president of the Northern
California branch of the league. It
reads as follows:
Oakland. Cal., Aur. S. 1901.
My Dear Brother: You are doubtless aware
ol the effort being made to abolish the bars on
our ferry boats. The liquor men are rallying
their forces and using all the influence of their
great organization to accomplish the defeat of
this effort in behalf of righteousness and order.
They have circulated a petition and secured
iTjany signatures asking that Â¦ the bars be
allowed to remain. Unless some action is taken
by the Christian people In this vicinity the
impression will prevail that the public favors
the continuance of this evil.
The friends of sobriety and righteousness
rourt not be silent on this important question,
but must boldly uphold those in authority who
are endeavoring to Introduce this much-needed
reform. To the end that the Christian people
may be afforded the opportunity to express
themselves, we request that at your regular
Rerviee to-morrow you present this matter to
your congregation and secure an expression
from them by rising vote, upholding President
Hays in his effort to overthrow this Influence
lor evil. > '

ferry-boat bars, the time for closing

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Aug. 5.
The State Anti-Saloon League of Cali
fornia, northern district, has through
its president, tbe Rev. E. E. Baker, pas
tor of the First Presbyterian Church.
"The growers feel utterly helpless," said
Daniel 'McCarthy of San Leandro, who is
much interested in plans for enlarging the
market for Alameda County fruits and
produce. "If the goods are shipped they
are likely to come back to the shipper
only to spoil and he pays the freight. The
strike means thousands of dollars of loss
to the agricultural interests of Alameda
County."- â¢
Many of the growers are turning to the
driers for relief. A great deal ol! fruit is
being dried at Haywards and Niles in the
.hope of saving it in that way. Driers
are working full time and plants are be
ing enlarged for the emergency.
The remarkable fact is that nearly all
of the fruit growers of Alameda County
made contracts for their goods with can
ners outside of Alameda County. This
necessitates the delivery of fruit by rail,
and while they can, get the goods to some
railroad station they cannot get them de
livered to the canneries. .
This loss falls entirely upon the farm
ers, for when the canneries, particularly
those in the cannery combine, made their
contracts with the' farmers for fruit and
vegetables they inserted a strike clause
which makes the goods returnable to the
shipper In case of a strike, and the ship
per not only loses the value of his goods
but is obliged to pay the freight. Several
carloads of fruit have been returned to
shippers in Alameda County..
No class of men feel the strike more
thanr the fruit growers and farmers of
Alameda County. The great bulk of the
acreage of thlg county is set out in fruits
and vegetables for canning and preserv
ing, and when the strike came the, farmers
found that it was impossible to get their
goods to the canneries.

| BELGRADE, Servia, Aug. 5.â The first
elections under the new constitution have
resulted ; in the return of eighty-three
Ministerialists, of which number seventy
one . are Radicals. The remainder are
Liberals and Independents. Thirty-eight
second ballots are necessary. The new
election laws are regarded as very liberal.
The registration amounted to 262,000 out
of 2S5.00O eliglbles. Secrecy of- the ballot
was secured by inclosing the voting blip
in a rubber ball. Members of each party
erect their, own rubber line of .urns in the
voting booth. The voter pushes his nst
into the- funnel-shaped'.; mouth . of. esich
urn,' so the officials do not "know where
the voter -has deposited his ballot. Â¦;â¢
Secrecy of the Ballot Is Secured by
Inclosing the Voting Slip jn

LONDON, Aug. 5.â Late dispatches re
ceived from Portsmoutn regarding Itae
wreck of the torpedo-boat destroyer Viper
off Alderney Island say that it Is believed
that the well-known difficulty in reversing
turbine engines contributed to the acci
dent.
A French fishing smack, acting as a
pilot, helped the crew to reach the shore.
The. Viper Was running at twenty knots
when the fog set in. She was then eased
down to five knots and was running at
that speed when she struck. When her
cables parted her stern smashed on the
rocks. She subsequently parted amid
ships and is now in three pieces, the stern
end being inverted on the rocks. If thore
had been much sea running when the acci
dent occurred it is probable that every
body aboard of her would have perished.
As it was the crew must have perished
but for the assistance rendered.

There is a bad mix-up of affairs in the
Thirty-seventh Assembly District. One
fact should be made clear. to the property
owners and other good citizens of the
Thirty-seventh, and that is the fact that
all â¢ the boss elements Â¦ are combining
against the Republican Primary League.
The plan of the bosses is to fuse the In
dependent Club and the Grand Hotelers
into an alliance. If the scheme succeeds
Kelly. and.Crimmins, who are working
und^r cover and playing on the vanity of
several respected citizens, will derive the
benefit of the fusion. As good a man as
George D. Clark, president of the Union
League Club, 'is in danger of being used
as an instrument of Boss Kelly.
Workingmen, business men, merchants
and others of the Thirty-seventh District
who are sincerely devoted to the cause of
honest municipal government should in
vestigate for themselves. Inquiry will es
tablish the truth of The Call's assertion
that: an alliance of all the boss elements
of the district is the scheme in view. The
response ! should . be a ' popular uprising . in
the Thirty-seventh in support of the Re
publican Primary League ticket. â¢ The big
registration convinces the boss leaders
that the people intend to take a hand in
the primary election; hence a scheme to
fool the people by fusion is presented.

Though Mrs. Kincaid says, she has

The allied bosses, with Martin Kelly in
command, intend to make a desperate
struggle to fasten boss rule on San Fran
cisco. In the Democratic camp apathy
prevails. Sam Rainey, convinced that the
Phelan-McNab combination cannot be
broken, has given orders for the Demo
cratic push to get In behind Boss Martin
Kelly. Yesterday the word was passed
along the line by Eddie Greaney telling
the Democrats who take orders to stand
in and save Kelly from defeat. This is an
old game of the bosses. It was * .often
played by Buckley to demoralize .Repub
lican forces. It is to be reintroduced by
Rainey. Citizens should -understand that
Rainey and Kelly are in close touch.

MURPHY WITH CONSPIRACY
Last night until a late hour- the rooms
of the Republican Primary League. 930
Market street, were crowded with earnest
fw e . ne . r eetic citizens. It was announced
that tickets should be filed at the Regis
trar s office before 12 m. to-night. The
law does not require this filing., but ft the
tickets are^filed early : the names can be
printed on the official tally sheets. Near-
JX *Â£ i, X l not a JL' the league tickets will be
filed before midnight. â¢ Â¦ , Â¦-,.'â¢ :Â¦Â¦ .-.7.
Â¦ The officers of the league and the promi
nent workers in the various districts are
confident of winning, a great victory at
the primary election next Tuesday." /All
the signs of the hour point to! a popular
uprising to down the allied bosses. As the
election day approaches citizens begin .to
perceive that the Issue is clear cut: ; The
Primary ' League declares i war on ; all the
bosses. .. r The only, sure iway of -rebuking
the bosses is to vote the straight ticket of
Republican Primary . League.
In view of this fusion of boss elements
and corrupt factions it becomes essential
that workingmen, business men, taxpay
ers and good citizens generally should re
double their efforts to save the city from
a reign of boss plunder. The bosses will
be defeated if citizens do their duty at
the primary election. Many followers of
the Democratic boss will refuse, no doubt,
to sign their names as Republican voters,
but they will be at the election booths
taking orders from Martin Kelly. It Is
a common trick of the boss rounders to
say to a voter who is known to be against
them: "This is not your precinct. You
vote at suqh'and such a number." Citi
zens who are not suspecting tricks eo
where they are directed and find that they
have been fooled. In their disgust some
decide to leave without voting. Citizens
must keep a sharp lookout for bogus i tick
ets. The bosses will freely use the motto
"anti-boss" to accomplish their ends. In
the mixed tickets names of prominent
citizens will ,be used. The allied Â¦ bosses-
Kelly, Rainey, Gage, Crimmins, Lynch
and- Herrinâ are holding back, their tick
ets until it is too late, for reputable citi
zens whose names may be placed thereon
to decline. If leading Republicans of San
Francisco are not watchful ,Kelly-and
Kalney will use their names to boost boss
tickets -in the Twenty-eighth, Twenty
ninth, Forty-first and Forty-third Assem
bly districts. In order that no mistake
may be made voters who desire to record
an unmistakable vote against the bosses
should procure the Republican Primary
League. ticket the day before election.
Vote that tifcket and no other. No doubt
the names of good men will be placed on
other tickets, but they will be placed there
to deceive and confuse the honest voter
The bosses are prepared tÂ» resort to every
trick and stratagem known to push poli
ticians. The law will not allow repeating
or fraud in tallying votes, hence the ticket

to aid the Kelly-Crimmins contingent of

a hard battle on his hands he sends for
Kelly and the latter responds with Repub
lican reinforcements. Rainey is now
bound by the obligations of bosshood and
moved .by the cohesive; power of public
plunder to go to Boss Kelly's rescue. .The
old push element of the Republican party
that was sonotorlous at Sacramento in
the prolonged Senatorial struggle has re- i
ceived orders to get hV behind Boss Kelly
and oppose the ticket of the Republican
Primary League.'
Boss Sam Rainey yesterday ordered' the Democratic push to enter the Republican fight and get
in behind Boss Martin Kelly. As Rainey claims to control the Fire Department of San Francisco the Fire
Commissioners are advised to be on their guard lest the department be plunged into the primary fight.

Last night Mrs. Flood surprised the po
lice by announcing that she had found the
money, and the ring under a lounge in her
rooms ' and would withdraw the charge
against Lutton.
The note showed evidence of the fact
that Lutton had known Mrs. Flood for
some time, although she declared to the
Judge, sha, had never seen him before Fri
day. In the note he wrote that he had
waited for her for half an hour and he
explained that he had been called out the
previous night on an emergency order
from the militia and had to go to the
armory and do six hours' duty. He prom
ised; to call again at 8 o'clock that even
ing. Â¦ .
Â¦ Mrs. . Flood told : a strange tale to' the
Judge.- She said that Lutton was a junk
dealer and that on Friday he called at
her house and she sold him some crock
ery ware. He picked up the diamond ring
from a table, put it on his finger and re
marked that it would look nice. When
he left she missed the ring and $35. He
called at the house next day . when shy
was out, she says, and her son saw the
diamond ring on his finger. He left a nota
for her with the boy and took $10.
Mrs. Alice Flood, 418 Ellis street, secured
a warrant from Judge Cabaniss yesterday
for the arrest of Fred Lutton on the
charg'e of grand larceny. j She accuses him

The prisoner is an ex-soldier and is 41
years of age. He says he had applied for
re-enlistment in the army. At one time
he worked for Weinhold and during his
term of employment became familiar with
the premises.
Just as Weinhold reached the rear door
a man in a soldier's uniform bolted past
him and, leaping a fence, made his escape.
Another form in citizen's attire then ap
peared in the doorway, but* Weinhold
grappled with the second intruder and
pushed him back in the room. The sa
loon man then seized a, large club and
threatened his captive with a fractured
skull if he attempted to cross the thres
hold again. Mrs. Weinhold called up Cap
tain Seymour; and Detectives Charles
Crockett and Tom Dillon were hurried to
the scene. . *
Shortly after 8 o'clock last night .Wein
hold heard a noise In his storeroom, which
is In the rear of the saloon. Calling his
wife from upstairs, . where the family
lives, he instructed her to bar the door
that' leads into "the bar, then went around
to the rear of the room in which he had
heard the sound of footfalls and falling
bottles.
Otto "Weinhold, a saloon-keeper at Lyon
and Lombard streets, surprised two bur
glars at work in his storeroom last night.
One of the criminals, who was dressed as
a soldier, made his escape, but the saloon
man blocked the exit of the other and
held him a captive while his wife tele
phoned to police headquarters for detec
tives. The officers handcuffed the thief
and brought him to the Central Police
Station, where he gave the name of Wil
liam H. Coleman, and proved to have been
once in the employ of the man he at
tempted to rob. He was charged with
burglary.

Dimmlck is being watched by secret
sen-ice men, though he has been dis
missed from the Government employ.
Superintendent Leach was seen yester
day and stated that he did not know the
secret service agent who was working in
Santa Barbara, and that the entire mat
ter of the Mint robbery was in the hands
of the secret service men. Agent Hazen
maintains his usual silence and positively
declines to discuss the robbery.
Although Dimmick is no longer a serv
ant of the Government, having been dis
missed on account of misconduct previous
to the discovery of the robberv, it is rec
ognized on all sides that he has always
been looked upon and is still regarded as
the one man who could tell where the
missing sacks of gold are located.
Dimmick's wife is now living with her
father. Judge Wright, at Santa Barbara.
Superintendent Leach stated yesterday
that he did not expect any action to be
taken in the matter of the robbery until
Director of the Mint Roberts arrived in
Washington, which will be about the 15th

The information given exclusively . by

that the Government was looking to Dim

In the years subsequent to the adoption
of the new State constitution it was dis
covered that many laws should be re
vised or amended. In 1895 the Governor
appointed a commission to revise the
codes, and such a commission existed
through the succeeding years up to the
session of the last Legislature, when its
recommendations were adopted.
-In anticipation of changes in the laws
the constitution had - provided for the
form in which such legislation should be
made. It seems probable, therefore, that
the manner in which revisions and
amendments were. printed for enactment
was due to an .oversight on the part of
the commission.

point was raised, are Gillis vs. Superior

County, Watt vs. Cook and Lewis vs.
Dunne of San Francisco County.
The particular cases in â¢ which manda
mus proceedings, were sought did not
bring up " the point at issue, but were
aimed at compelling the judges against
whom the. writs were directed to perform
certain duties which they maintained were
nbt necessary according. to the new codes,
but were compulsory under the old ones.
Incidentally, then, the question" as to the
constitutionality of the revisions was
raised. On the outcome of the decision
there depends the settlement of a multi
tude of cases. /
The form in which revisions and amend
ments.were presented to the last Legisla
ture was a connotation of the numeral by
Â¦which the statute is designated, followed
by the text of whatever it was desired to
repeal, add or correct. In such fragment
ary, form and apparently in violation of
the State constitution, the codes were
adopted. Unless the Supreme Court can
find a loophole of escape the original laws
will have to stand. -
No law shall be revised or amended by refer
ence to Its title, but in each case the act
revised or section amended shall be re-enacted
and published at length as revised or amended.
The question raised by the Attorney
General was whether or not section 34 of
article IV of the . State constitution had
been complied with by the Legislature.
The particular portion of the sectlfin
which refers to revisions and amendments
says: : - ! . .
The Attorney General first brought up
the matter and in every succeeding case
the same argument was made by the dif
ferent counsel. Three more hearings to
-which the same question applies are
"scheduled for â¢ to-day and the Supreme
Court must decide the issue before action
can be taken in any case.
The Supreme Court was confronted yes
terday in . five different proceedings in
mandamus with the question of .the con
stitutionality of the revised codes adopted
at' the last session of the Legislature and
which went into effect on July 1.
The secret service men here now are
uncommunicative and from all that can
be conjectured they are awaiting orders
from Burns or possibly his return from
San Francisco.
It was learned to-day that the Govern
ment officials ot the secret service have
delved into Dimmick's life thoroughly.
'liiey have also made a search for &oid
not only in Xhe house of Judge Wright,
his father-in-law, bO% it is said ii\ other
places. The officers have resented in
quiries by newspaper men and the results
of their efforts cannot be found out at
this time. That the process has been
thorough is shown by the fact that Agent'
Bums and his picked men were at work
for the space of a whole month, and not
a few days as was at first supposed.
Burns is now in San Francisco, but he
left this place so well garrisoned with his
secret forces that not a move can be made
bearing on the investigation in hand that
will not be instantly known to them.
Whether or not the authorities have any
thing against Dimmlck cannot be said,
but there is no question that he is the cen
tral tlgure in their secret inquiry here.
Judge Wright, the father-in-law of Dim
mick, is much grieved over the course
the Investigation seems to have taken and
he reiterates his assurance that Dimmlck
is perfectly Innocent. He said to-night
that his faith in his son-in-law is un
shaken. That the search of his property
was made he admits, but he says that it
came to nothing. He declines to enter
into any details about it. Judge Wright
stated that in all of Burns' dealings he
was a perfect gentleman, and, added the
Judge. "I sunpose he performed the duty
he was sent here to do."

Railroad men say Muir is a most capa
ble man and has always shown the great
est enthusiasm in his work. Others claim
that Hays has decided to make a clean
sweep of all those who were appointed
under the old regime and put younger
men in their places.
Railroad officials who are In a position,
to know refused to either affirm or deny
the rumor yesterday. To all questions they
shook "their heads and said they "knew
nothing about It." Muir is an old attache
of the road and has been a division super
intendent for many years, and his resig
nation would come as a great surprise to
those who are not in the confidence of the
new manasement.
The rumor was freely circulated around
the big yellow building yesterday that
John Muir, superintendent of the Los An
geles division of the Southern Pacific, was <
shortly to resign.
Rumor Current That He
Will Be Forced to
Resign.

_^||jOLLAR for dollar, pound for pound, there is
| $JPI| more in Ivory Soap than in any household
I soap. It is easy to find a cheap soap; but
llUr^ i to find purity and low price in a single soap
is not easy. They combine in Ivory Soap. You
can afford to use it in the laundry; you can not
afford not to use it elsewhere. It is vegetable-oil
soap, in the cheapest form in which it can be pro-
cured. You pay nothing for a fancy box, wrapper
or perfume. It is all in the soap! It floats.
