WASHINGTON. March 31.â It was said
at bom the .White House and War De

ing had been received by the Government
regarding: the alleged unearthing of
crooked work on' the part of the army
quartermasters and others in Luzon and
the arrest of a number of persons in and
out of the army for stealing property of
the Government or. receiving stolen Gov
ernment, property. General Corbln said,'
furthermore, that the Government had no
Intimation. of any sort that such develop
ments might be expected. He was In
clined for. this reason to believe the frauds
against the Government could hardly be
so sericus afe reported. - though admitting
that this opinion was based wholly on the
lack of advices from the Government.

vailing tendency of the great movements
of this century would differ radically
from those of the earlier part of the last
100 years, when nearly all movements

before they were paid by Cashier Rels

cation of forgery on them.
Opinion of -Treasurer's Deputies.
"We thought It 'was strange that Sul-.
llvan presented so ' many ' orders," said
Perkins, "but he explained that he was
cashing them for the parties who had
furnished the ball, and who were .too
busy to come to the office. He presented
seven orders on Saturday for ball money,
and they were cashed. We will not be
able to tell what orders were forged until
we go over. the books and the orders for
ball which are on file. A few days afgo
I happened to. speak to a police officer
about Sullivan, who was passing by. and
the officer said he Â¦was "a. bad one." "We
knew that he was connected with the of
fice of the bond and warrant clerk, and
there was not the slightest suspicion of
anything - being wrong."
Deputy Perkins further- stated ths.t last
week Bond and Warrant Clerk Peery was
behind three days In making- up the dally
returns of his office and that on Saturday
a telephone message was sent to Peery
Insisting that the returns be made.
"Sullivan answered the phone." said
Perkins, "and said the office was too busy
to make up the papers. We insisted that
the returns must . be finished and late in
the day they were returned to us."
Perkins an.d Chief Deputy Rels of the
Treasurer's office stated last night that
when Peery had been asked as to the au
thority of Sullivan acting for the offlce
he had replied "What Sullivan does la all
right." ; )
Among the bail orders cashed by Sulli
van Saturday was one for $250 in the case
of Chung Suey. a Chinese gembler. The
bail was deposited March 23, and Sullivan,
drew it down on the 20th. For some rea
son known to himself Sullivan secured
the receipt for the money, given when the

decided to operate. The operation was
performed by Dr. Fralick, assisted by Dr
Carpenter, Dr. Ralph S. Fralick of New

It was found that a tumor had forme-J
In the stomach. The organ was contract
ed to about half of its normal size and
considerably hardened. After taking up
the blood vessels connected with the
stomach the operation was begun
It was not intended at first to perform
so radical an operation as the removal
of the entire^ organ." As the examination
progressed, however, the surgeons saw
that there -was nothing to be done but re
move it practically entire.
More than two-thirds of the stomach
was taken out and the ryloric and oeso
phageal ends were joined. A part of tha
membrane was used in effecting the union.
A small tube was thus formed in which
some of the glands of the stomach still
remained. In the course-of a month it is
likely that, this portion of the organ may
receive Mod. although it; is doubtful if
the glands will perform their functions
The stomach was a solid mass, which
was cut with difficuity. This remnant not
removed was dropped back in the abdom
inal cavity and the usual dressings were
applied. The patient will live on-prefll-

LONDON, March 31.â The attack
made, by Herbert ; Gladstone,
I member of J'arjiament for "West
Leeds, upon the apathetic policy
of the Government, and his vig
orous indictment of the> measures for
which he holds Colonial Secretary Cham
berlain : particularly responsible, has
caused a tremendous sensation through
oat the country. '. Â£; ->4 :
It was apparently. Gladstone's purpose
i to arouse ' the Liberals from a sense of
false security and move them to "ac^. Im
mediately and with the strength. of union
against the present weak management of
. .the. party directing- the destinies- ofâ the
nation. . In this he has succeeded. The
Liberals have already manifested a will
â¢ ingness to make a forceful attack on the
defective portions Â» of .the Government
fabric, and, if possible, to extricate the
Conservatives from some of the ; difficul
ties into which, they have fallen, v. .
' The practical abolition of the House: of
Lords has become a question of widest in

King may -be forced : to comply with, the
demands of the Liberals or if a frank ap

First Pacification, Then Self-
Go vernment, Says Pitz
hugh Lee.
OMAHA. March 3Lâ General FItzhugh
Lee for the first time since his retirement
from the army has given expression to his
views with regard to the future of Cuba.
The occasion was tie- banquet given in his
honor at the Omaha. Club. After referring
to: his service as Consul General and in
the army in that island he said:
More than ever must there be an exercise
of patriotism in its hig-be-st sense by the citi
zens of the United States. The ship of state
has extended its sailing cbart to parts of the
vorld undreamed of until recently as being
tn its ccurse. The . Philippines are ours by
treaty and their future, so far as th^e United
Â£tate* is concerned, should be duly determined
by Congress after, and not before, the armed
resistance to the authority of the United States
r<aÂ» ceased. The splendid exploit "of Fciiston
throws a brilliant light upon the coming, path
or' peace.
Porto Rico is ours by con<jnest. while Cuba
has its status fixed by the Teller resolution
in the act declaring war against Spain. Un
der that resolution thÂ« -United States dls
olttms any intention of 'exercising soveretenty,-
J-.irh'diction or control owr the island of Cuba,
oeept for the pacification thereof, and when
that is accomplished the government of the
if-'and should be turned over to its own peo
ple. - That solemn declaration, is binding on
the Government, and. in. my opinion, would
bf and should be rigidly adhered to.
The expenditure of treasure and blood, the
dead ; American- solcHers- and sailors, tha geo
giaphical location- of the island, the large in
terests held by the Americans. Spanish. Eng
lish. German. French and; Indeed, the Cubans
t 'K-mselves, demand that, the island should not
ot.ly be pacified, but be permanently pacified.
The pledpe of the United States does not de
rr.end that American control or supervision be
absolutely- withdrawn If 'the United States.
f rein -evidence before the 1 proper department,
bflleves that the Cubans . will , fight among
themselves before or shortly after the Ameri
can soldiers now in Cuba stack their musket^
on American jsoil. , ... - ;
The war -was waged to make - Spain with
draw Its land and naval 'forces from Cuba
and .relinauish its authority on the island.
That havinr been accomplished, the United
States is now concerned In upholding Its
solemn pledge of pacification in the interest
Â°Cuba will agree in time to the conditions
imposed by the Platt amendment in the inter
ests of Its own Independence and In order that
the -United States can. faithfully maintain the
pledged pacification of" the island.
Thirtr-one meiribers were < elected, or rather
selected, from the whole. Island to constitute
a constitutional convention.- When its -work
is completed the organization of a government
fhould follow, and when that is accomplished
the jurisdiction and control of the- island will
undoubtedly If* turned over to. the Cubans.
The ' foreiKTJ and other property' holders want
protection and peace. ' The majority of Cu
bans., constituting the. .agriculturists, are ap
parently Ignorant that a convention Is in ses
ftion, and It is most difficult to make them
vote on the question. As many portions of
China did not know a war was in progress
Â¦w-ith Japan, so many Cubans pay no atten
tion to the war of words of the convention.
The Cuban ex-mldlers are active and more or
less excited. When the time conies to fill the
povernment offices they, will be heard Of
"often and early."'
CtÂ»ba> future will be determined by Cuba's
Ftatesn-.anship. Should the collective Cuban
wisdom be auf ficient to- keep the craft ' afloat
on the waters of prosperity, ana establish, .a
stable government strong enough to protect
life and property aÂ»d give confidence to.capi
tal there will be no disposition on the part
of the United States to interfere: but. if the
government problem - v cannot be* solved | after
a fair trial- by. the ..Cubans, the future destiny
of the "smile of the sea 1 ' will be forever con
fided to the care of the great American
republic,.- - - Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ -

High Bates for Bonds.
WASHINGTON, March 31.â Secretary
Gage was questioned to-day as to his
probable action with respect to the cash
accumulations in the treasury; and par
tlculartyas- td whether he contemplated
buying bonds for the sinking fund. : : :
"The country would like to know," it
was stated to. the Secretary, /.'whether thej
accumulation j of. money; In the treagur^/
which seems to be going on, will not op
erate to the prejudice, of generaiibuslness
affairs. J Your estimate is that there- will
be a surplus of receipts over, expenditures
for the fiscal -year ending June 30 next of
about eighty million dollars. 'Your state
ment published yesterday shows that
some Â¦*40,OOO;OOO of" that sum' already "had
been realized. This would.. indicate that
within , tne next . three ' months > $40,000,000
mort of cash .will be gathered -intd 4lie

ket."
"The estimates you speak of," replied
Secretary Gage, "were made before the
last session of. Congress and have "been
modified by events and by Congressional
action. ; It Is not now contemplated 'that
the year's surplus will be over 560,000,000.
A falling off in receipts or larger dis
bursements than have been estimated
may also further modify the effect to
which you point."
"To put the matter in a nutshellâ if it be
a choice between buying bonds at an arti
ficial price and letting funds accumulate
In'the treasury, the "latter will occur, nor
will the department advertise for'offer
ings of bonds. To do so I am satisfied
would be fruitless in results. If; how
ever, the department can from time to
time buy the short t>onds at' an investment

would no doubt be willing to buy these,
and thus relieve the treasury from a sur

new .2" per cents at their present price
yield a; higher investment return of L73.

acknowledged, fact that a long-time Gov 1
ernment bond, everything else being equal,
Is" worth' relatively " more than a short
time bond. The present disparity to the
contrary Is; therefore," illogical "If not" airti-'

"As an alternative, would you not in

, "No. That would aggravate in some
particulars the situation to which I have
just re/erred. To qualify as depositories
the banks would have, to buy and deposit
bonds. The Â«ftect would be to set up. a
competition by the aid of the Government
against the Government . in' the purchase
of the securities already abnormally high.
"We are now advancing toward Â¦ a period
of , the. year * when there is apt to.be a
money plethora instead of scarcity, so I
do not see that it will do any particular
harm if money accumulates in the treas

FINDS BROTHER
AND A FORTUNE
SAX BERNARDINO, March 31.âInfor
mation reached here to-day of what will
probably terminate in a fatal shooting
affair between two mining men in the
Ballarat gold mining district, 200 miles
northeast of this city, near the San Ber
nardlno-Inyo County line.
"Jack" McCauley and Allen Phelps were
engaged in playing a game of poker witn
eight other miners, when an argument
arose over who should deal the card-;.
The matter was left to the crowd, aa-1
it was voted that McCauley should have
the deal. This decision made Phelps an
gry, and, whipping from his pocket a
large revolver, he challenged McCauley
to fight. The latter refused, whereupoi
he was shot by Phelps. The bullet, nrcJ
across the table, entred McCauley's left
side and ranged upward, carrying with it
a piece of clothing, which the attending
physician fears will cause blood poisoning.
At last reports his condition was critical.
After the shooting Phelps expressed a
desire to surrender to an officer, but as
yet he has not been taken into custody
because the wounded man refuses to
make a charge, saying he does not wish
to prosecute. - Â¦ ',-Â¦--,
At the outbreak of the war with Spain
Phelps and McCauley were young farm
hands near Oklahoma City. O. T. They
enlisted with Roosevelt's Rough RIde.-s,
Â«.nd saw active service in the Cuban cam
paign*, .during which time they were In
separable. Upon being mustered out, the
comrades came west to seek their fortune,

they were at the time of their probably
fatal quarrel.

ENDS LIFE IN ABIZONA
NEW. YORK, March 31.â In Its forth
coming issue Leslie's Weekly will print
a . paper by Colonel" John S. Mosby, the
famous Confederate raider, on "The
Dawn of the Real South'" in which : he
says:
The real â¢ South is just at its birth. " The
growth of this child of the nation may be
gradual, â¢ but . in the end the South will be far
richer and more powerful â¢ than the North. In
the days to come the South will become the
dominant section of the country.
Without the war of. secession the South could
never have hoped to attain the future that is
now certain. Slavery was a great incubus,
paralyzing natural energy. By abolishing this
wrong our war benefited every State south ot
the Mason and Dlxon line. .The negroes are
producing more as freemen than they ever did
as slaves: and the mass of the' people are
vastly better oft to-day than they were under
the old ante-bellum system.
Socially as well as industrially the abolition
of slavery was highly beneficial in its results
to the masses, for slavery was a great wrong
and no community can exist in the highest
state of happiness-when its system is based on
wrons. . . Â¦'*-.--..
There are the soundest reasons for asserting
that the nezroes* status is bound to improve.
While they are not as near the equality with
white people as they were under the system of
slavery, they are certain to be absorbed by im
migration, and in this engulfment they Â¦ will
disappear. This is the. natural and wisest so
lution of what we now call the Â¦ "race prob
lem."
Richmond is tha city most likely, to become
in time the banking center and - commercial
headquarters of 'this country and therefore â¢ of
the world. The days of the famous old city
as a political capital, are past, but its "career
as the central point of manufacture for the
whole South and for the world at large is Just
beginning. While great forces have been work
ing for the change industrially and socially the
political change is hardly less marked It is
well-nigh folly - to-day to speak : of the ' 'Solid
South." That," by the way, was a phrase of
my own invention.; When Hayes became -the
Republican candidate for President, I urged
(in . a ' letter, August, 1876) that it was better
for some Southern : man to support him, be
cause\ If he â¢ were - elected his , administration
must necessarily rest-on whatever supported it
It was better for the Southern people to divide
between the parties, so that, no matter which
side won, there would be men friendly to South
ern people, who would control its Southern pol
icy. This contention is fully realized to-day
and the '."Solid South" belongs wholly to the
political past. , : v ..

STREET, N.W., WASHINGTON, .March
31.â In response to~ a request; from The'
Call' former Senator. Arthur P.* Gorma'VJof
Maryland gave an. interview.; at ; his home
In Washington regarding jthe radical po
litical legislation*enactefi;atf Annapolis in
extra session, -iwE^chV has: made \him~ one
of the most talked ; about Democrats in
the United States." On the ' result . of the
legislation may depend whether Maryland
is to hereafter be in . the | Democratic . or
the Republican column; whether Mr; Gor
man is to return to the United States Sen
ate in 1903 and whether he is to become
the ' Democratic/ candidate for President
in 1904. What .Maryland has" done arid
what Mr. Gorman, strongly- defended . in
his interview to-day Is liKely to " become
a' great -political- issue in Congress aflts
next session, . because the Kepublicans
. threaten to reduce the representation '. in
Congress not only of Maryland but of all
Southern ' States , in which the right of
negroes to vote : is 5 restricted. Mr. : Gor
man asserts:".
That the changes made in <the voting
system of , Maryland do not come .within
tne purview â¢ of â¢" ' Congress, because no
rights guaranteed .under the constitution
to any voter have* been impaired.
That the : new j State census ,was ordered
for legislative - apportionment purposes
because the Â¦ Federals census was Â¦ notori
ously padded for Â¦ Republican partisan
ends, as confessed by recent arrests.
That the registration' law was amended
so as to restrict the ballot. to actual resi
dents of the State, " since under the . old
law thousands of v. non-residents, former
residents and . temporary residents had
voted. Â¦ *' " . Â¦'Â¦â¢â¢.-. Â¦- Â¦'
That the amendment of the election laws
to prevent a person "having assistance in
marking his ballot, , unless physically dis
abled, was necessary because every man
who wanted -to sell 1 his vote claimed to be
illiterate and ' the election official who
went Into the booth could tell the vote
buyer how the vote: was cast.
: :No f Ballot for Illiterates.
Mr. Gorman lays stress on the fact that
the new Maryland ballot is an exact coun
terpart of ' the Massachusetts ballot ' and
strongly indorses the policy of preventing
illiterates voting, which is the avowed
purpose of law.
"What is to be said in explanation of
the new ballot law?". he was asked.
"The law of 1K96 provided that any
voter who. in registering declared that he
could not read or ; write could, when he
presented himself at the polls, call upon
the ballot clerks, one a Democrat and the
other a Republican, and have their as
sistance in marking -his ticket. This pro
vision furnished the opportunity for cor
ruption. All that it was necessary to do
was for a voter at registration to'say that
he could not' read nor write. Then on
election day, when he had made his bar
gain for his vote, he called for the ballot
clerks and they saw him cast his ballot
for the Democratic or Republican ticket,
a3 the case might be. While the â¢ clerks
were sworn not to divulge how any voter
cast his ballot, yet the practical opera
tion of the law was. that when the voter
left the booth the clerk of the party
whose ticket ho voted â¢ could signal to a
party watcher whether the voter had car
ried out his bargain. It was not a perfect
system in the purchase of voters, but it
intimidated negroes who stand in fear of
their party.
"To accomplish a result so much desired
by all cJtizens of .Maryland and to secure
pure elections, the Legislature enacted a
law providing for a ballot identical in
form to- that used in Massachusetts' for
many years. The ticket is to be pub
lished in. magnified type in the newspa
pers prior to the election. Specimen bal
lots, printed on cardboard, will be distrib
uted in each election district two days be
fore election and an additional number
on the day of election, so that party man
agers will have - full opportunity, to in
struct each voter how to mark'his ballot
before! he goes into the booth. If he can
read or distinguish the difference between
Republican and Democrat he will be able
to mark his ticket without, difficulty,, or
if he can be instructed to count he can
likewise mark his ticket without trouble.
All the Legislature. has done is to pro
hibit one man from - marking another
man's . ticket." â¢/Â¦ . . . Â¦ -, .-. -. */Â¦;Â¦'â¢;
Disf rancnisement of Negroes. . ;
"But, Mr. Gorman," I said, "it is staed
in the discussion of the question that the
law in operationâ and It was so intended
will disfranchise. 40.000 or 50.000 negroes In
your State, who have heretofore .exer
cosed the right of-suffrage." - ...
â¢ Mr. Gorman replied:. "There are no data
which accurately show the^number of il
literate males in Maryland above the age
of . 21 years. . In Â¦' the registration books
large numbers are recorded as illiterate,"
but, as I have shown,. this largely arose
from the fact that under the Republican
law a voter .who declared -he was Illiterate
was Riven assistance in marking his bal
lot. If there are many illiterates in Mary
land who will, be, affected by the passage
of the present law. the blame lies with
themselves. We have had the . most : per
fect system of public schools for thirty
years of anv State south of Pennsylvania,
Since 1870 the colored population has had
amole opportunity to learn to read and

When Carnegie's offer to give .New York^City

THE LIBERALS AND THE LORDS.
WERE there -no other evidences at hand of the
demoralization of the Liberal party in Great
Britain, its weakness would be made amply evi
dent by the eager applause with which it has greeted
the recent letter of Herbert Gladstone to his constitu T
ents.; * A party is surely in sad need of a leader and of
a programme that welcomes .with acclaim such a pro
gramme from a man of such, comparative unimpor
tance as a Parliamentary leader.
In his letter Gladstone declares: "The war in
South Africa will cost not far short of Â£200,000,000
ana the settle.ment seems as far off as ever. There are
problems to be. solved; in the Far East"of the first
magnitude, and the Government appears destitute of
a clear, settled policy.' "Already the huge "expenditure
for the army and navy is going up by leaps and bounds
and will force Europe to add to its ruinously large
armaments. /Where is it to'end? The Irish question
is more to the front than ever, and the Government
seems to view it with apathetic impotence." , â¢'*
y All of that is true enough, but party leadership must
_ Fortunately for the children and for tiie State there
is at present a reaction against the tendency toward
overworking pupils. The law that forbids the impo
sition of home study is a manifestation of that reac
tion, and there are â¢ good reasons for believing that
when its effects are seen and understood it will be
universally approved. . ' -.
The desire on the part of many well-meaning per
sons to make, the schools a place of training in all
kinds of instruction was recently illustrated at an edu
cational meeting at Manchester, N. H., when a prom
inent citizen complained that many boys in the cities
of the State are growing up without a knowledge of
how to drive or even harness a horse, which every
country boy knew; and advised that every school be
provided with a horse and buggy, so that this very
useful information could be given.
In our eagerness to provide in the public schools a
comprehensive system of education, covering almost
every department of human knowledge, we have laid
too heavy burdens upon the minds of the young, it
hp.s been a fad with some people to introduce into the
schools instruction upon any and every subject that
struck them as important. Now there are very few
kinds of learning that are not important, and conse
quently, by adding one study after another to the
school course, we reached at last a point where it was
necessary to keep a pupil grinding away at work not
only during the whole school hours but in the evening
as well. 1 . ' â¢
GOVERNOR GAGE'S signature to the so-called
"home study" bill makes it now the law of
California that in the public schools of the
State "no pupil under the age of fifteen years in any
grammar or primary .school shall be required to do
any home study." The o'peration of the measure,
which goes into effect on July 1, will be watched with
close attention. by all interested in public-school work,
though there is little doubt that the results will every
where justify its enactment. That much seems assured
by the tests made in this city and elsewhere by com
paring the work done by pupils from whom no home
study was required with that of others upon whom the
requirement was imposed. -

.tain feedstuff's. Coal oil advanced Friday, but declined
again Saturday. Grain bags are higher,- showing expec
tations of a large , crop.. Ocean steamers are still
pressed for room to accommodate all the proffered
freight for export. No complaints are heard from any
quarter, and the merchants as a rule report satisfactory
commercial conditions. . Funds continue plentiful and
resdily accessible to solvent borrowers, and collections
are as good as they ever are. If there are any rocks
ahead they are not visible at the moment.
It will be seen, by looking over the preceding para
graph, that trade shows considerable irregularity.
While the aggregate business is larger than last year,
some lines are weak and dull, and others active and
firm. The improvement is by no means general.
It is expected that ihe figures for the first quarte:
of the year will show a large increase in general busi
ness over the corresponding period in previous years.
Barring wool and cotton, all lines have been more or
less active, which is rather unusual during the last half
of winter, hence the sanguine expectation. At pres
ent, however, wool seems to be doing better ag^.
Sales at the three Eastern markets have recently
shown a marked inc. ... se f while prices are exhibiting
more tone. The sales at Boston alone last week were
nearly 6,000,000 pounds, and shipments were also
â¢Lrger. All "attempts to advance prices, however,
proved fruitless. Cotton" still drags, and it has been
found impossible to maintain the small advance es
tablished in the raw product a few days ago. Build
ing operations throughout the country are being
planned on a liberal scale, as shown by the good de
mand for lumber, structural iron and builders' hard
ware. The West continues to lead the rest of the
country in this respect The extremely large earnings
of the railroads and the continued scarcity of cars in
dicate an enormous movement of merchandise be
tween the different markets. The boot and shoe trade
is again looking up, shipments outward from factories
showing a marked increase, and though some New
England shops report fewer orders the majority have
enough to keep them employed for several months to
come, while the heretofore unfavorable balance for the
teason has been materially reduced. The iron trade is
still forging ahead, with sustained activity and a fur
thei advance in structural material. The dry goods
trade, however, like cotton, is reported gloomy, with
additional price reductions in a- number of descrip
tions, accompanied by a corresponding falling off in
the demand. Wheat, per contra, is in decidedly bette*
shape, being quoted at an advance over the preceding
week, though little increase in the movement is ex
hibited. Some of this advance is attributed to sym
pathy with corn, which has been active of late, with
rising quotations. Hides are weak and dragging,
with accumulating stocks, but most kinds of leather
are firmly held. The other staples stand about as
before.
AS far as surface indications go trade continues
on a sound and active basis. The country's
bank clearings continue to range considerably
jboie those for corresponding periods last year, those
last 'week showing a gain of 33.2 per cent, with Minne
apolis the only important city exhibiting a decrease.
This city has lately been lagging in this respect, which
would indicate some lassitude in the flour trade. The
country's failures were 206, against 203 last year. It
has been some time since the failures for the two
years have been so close together, there having been
of late a decided balance against the current year.
BUSINESS STILL GROWING.
Matters of that kind, ought not to be passed over
as of no consequence. It cost civilization an immense
sum of treasure and many thousands of lives to abolish
slavery. Shall we now in the name of "expediency"
pcrmit.it to rise in the new century?
From the reports that come to us it appears that
Ilerr Bebel, the Socialist leader, moved that "all chil
dren born under the German flag" should be declared
free. The motion was designed to affect the blacks
of the German colonies in South Africa. The support
ers of the Government, we are tpid, took the position
that slavery is necessary to enable European colonists
to carry on industry in tropical countries, and that
to declare the freedom of every one born in a German
colony would virtually mean the ruin of the! colony.
When the motion was put to a vote it was defeated
by a large majority. ~ ; ,"" . .- Â¦ < '''?,>â¢â¢
The most notable illustration, of the change, how
ever, is one that has just been furnished in Germany.
What has been done by our officials and by the British
officials has after all been excused and as far as pos
sible apologized for. Neither in Congress nor in Par :
liament is it at all likely that a debate on the subject
w.ould bring any open defense of any sort/of slave
system, but the Germans have had just such a debate
in the Reichstag, and the supporters of slavery appear
to have had the courage to speak out and speak
boldly. ''â¢'Â«;'.'/
Such being the case.it is surprising tp note that in
eveiy part of the globe the civilized nations have begun
the new. century with, what appears to be a reaction
against the doctrine and the practice of liberty. The
ardent outcry against slavery that sounded so nobly
throughout the century that has just closed has given
place to a low but significant declaration that after all
it may be expedient to maintain slavery in Asia and in
Africa; that all men are not fitted for freedom; that
in the interests of trade and of industry and for the
advancement of civilization it may be necessary to
m.nke the brown man and the black man work under
the lash for the white man, who has taken up the
burden of governing him.
. The change of sentiment which has come over the
dominant nations of the earth in this respect is not
able everywhere. Even in the United Statesmen
have arisen who are willing to sanction slavery under
the United States! flag and United States law in the
Sulu Islands "because it is expedient." A similar
backsliding is noted among the British authorities in
South Africa. It is there believed, and the belief is
acted upon in practice, that a system of virtual slavery
is expedient for the working of the big mines and the
development of the country. . .. ,'
To bring about a realization, of that philosophy by
applying it in practical politics the nineteenth century
worked long and fought hard. The results are among
the most glorious ever achieved in human history.
The suppression of the African slave trade, the eman
cipation of ; slaves throughout the British empire, the
abolition of slavery in this country at. the cost of a
fearful civil war, and the gradual abolition of slavery
and serfdom in all other parts of the civilized world,
from Russia to Brazil, are deeds that will render for
ever memorable the generations of statesmen, heroes
and. reformers who brought them about. -
TWENTIETH , CENTURY EXPEDIENCY.

I the nineteenth drew a high aspiration for the
* â¢ equality of man. " The establishment of the in
dependence of the United States and the outbreak of
the French revolution, the two greatest events which
immediately preceded the beginning of the century,
had in common an assertion of the rights of men.
The French declaration, "Liberty, Equality and Fra

Ttffe prompt action of the President shows that if
any such jealousy exists it is not sufficiently powerful
to affect the administration. An honorable career in
arms under the flag of the Union is not closed against
any citizen who undertakes it with ardor and genius.
We have therefore in this instance the pleasure of
seeing a demonstration of the essential democracy of
our Government, as well as the rewarding, of a hero,
and consequently there is a double reason for popular
gratification. . 1
The merit of Funston's gallant deed has be$m. rec
ognized in Europe as well as in America. British
military experts have seen in it another evidence thnt
in* that part of war where success is due mainly to indi
vidual initiative and daring the American soldier is
superior to any other in the world. From the ranks
of our volunteers there comes a spirit of valor and a
skill in scouting and skirmishing that cannot be taught
in the schools. We shall consequently lose something
if there ever comes a time when our military com
manders are chosen exclusively from among men who
have been educated at the academy. We must have a
career for talent in the army as well as in civil life, and
it is a- fortunate thing for the country that in every
war in which we are engaged there arise volunteers
like Funston to keep the ? way open for such a career
to those who are to come after them.
Those facts taken in' connection with the scandals
growing Â¦ out of the quarrel between Sampson and
Schley, and other evidences of jealousy here and there,
have given rise to a fear that there is a good deal more
of ill feeling and jealousy in the army. and the navy
than there ought to be. Consequently when the re. â¢
ports came that certain influences at Washington were
opposing the promotion of Funston it is not surpris
ing that they were widely believed, and that the public
was more or less disturbed by them.
While not one of those reports may have been well
founded, it is certain they were not wholly disbelieved
bj a considerable portion of the people. Facts have
appeared from time to time, showing that among som:
of the graduates of the military academy at West
Point and the naval academy at Annapolis there is a
feeling of hostility to all who seek to obtain rank in
either the army or the navy without having graduated
firm those institutions. The number of officers who
share in that feeling of hostility may be and doubtless
is small, but unfortunately it is not uninfluential. The
country has again and again had disagreeable illustra
tions of it in the treatment of officers promoted from
the ranks in the army, and in the letter from Sampson
concerning the promotion of seamen to the rank of
commissioned officers in the navy.
Â¦\A ORE than ordinary gratification will be felt
I A - over President McKinley's action in promptly
* * promoting Funston to the rank of brigadier
general in the regular army of the United States. It
iv always pleasing to see a hero rewarded under any
circumstances, but in this case there are other serious
reasons for gratification, ; for there" have been rumors
and reports that certain influences emanating from,
high circles in the army were adverse to Funston's
claims and were opposed to his promotion.
FUNSTON'S PROMOTION.
Should some Democratic leader write a letter deal
ing with the policy of his party on the issues' of the
time, and after denouncing the administration for the
cost of the occupation of the Philippines proceed to
say that Democracy will not be willing to accept the
burdens of Government unless the p.arty is assured
that the Senate will not stultify its plans, he would be
regarded as. a political. freak rather than as a states;
man; and yet such a letter would not be a bad parallel"
to the Gladstone letter. There has been an agitation
in Great Britain for many a year to reform the House
of Lords, just as there has been an agitation in this
country to provide for the election United States
Senators by direct "vote of the people, but the party
that waits for that reform to be adopted before it
accepts the responsibilities of government might as
well disband as a political organization. It may con
tinue to serve some purpose in conducting academic
discussions, but it cannot be a force of. any potency
hi political affairs.
It may be that Mr. Gladstone means that the Liberal
party is to make the abolition of the House of Lords
or, its domination by the Liberals the chief issue of
the next political compaign. Should that be so he
would still have to. furnish the country with some sort
cf a programme of action, so as to justify his demand
that the Lords be set aside in order, to make way for
it. Unless he furnish some plan of that kind and can
convince the voters that it is not only good, but is so
good as to make it 'worth while to alter the constitu
tion of the country to bring it about, he can hardly
call his scheme a matter of practical politics..
offer something more! than a denunciation of , the op
posite, party: The British public ; wiil naturally ask
what the Liberals' propose to do to' remedy .the evil
effects of the Tory blunders. 7 To that question Mr.
Gladstone has no definite answer. He covers his eva
sion by saying: "The advocates of the Liberals are
not endeavoring to take up the Government's burden
until they have exacted conditions that their '. policy
will not again; be stultified by the rejection* of their
measures by the House of Lords." 'Â¦ ,

naming and classifying is, with some
modifications, according to laws passed in
1858 and 1862, and is entirely unsuited bo
far as relate to rating, to vessels of 'the
present day. The law of 1853 rated steam
ships of forty guns or more as first rates,
those of twenty guns and under forty as
second, and all of less than twenty guns
as third rates. There were also to be
four classes to be commanded In their

Of the men of Maine who have acquired .
great wealth through their own efforts
there is none with a career more interest
ing than Hugh Chisholm. His name has
come into exceptional prominence of late
through his position as president of the
International Paper Company, a corpora
tion with $55,000,000 capital, which controls
a very large proportion of the product of
all the paper pulp mills in the United
States.. '. ' â¢
Mr. Chisholm's business career had its
beginning in : I860, when as a. lad of 13
years, he secured a "run" as a newsboy
on a railway train. From that modest
beginning, handicapped by force of cir
cumstances which had deprived him of
educational advantages, he gradually de
veloped into a successful merchant, man
ufacturer,. railroad builder, developer of
water power and projector of industrial
enterprises. "When he left Maine two
years ago to reside In New York City and
there discharge the duties of president
of the great paper company he was rated
the second richest man in. the State.
â¢ Mr. Chisholm was born at Niagara-on
the-Lake, Canada, May 2, 1847. His
parents were natives of Inverness, Scot
land. He became a train newsboy be
cause it was necessary for him to earn
his own livelihood. His "run" was be
tween Detroit, Mich., and Toronto on the
Grand Trunk Railroad. At the Detroit
end of the route he soon formed the ac- ,
quaintance of a bright newsboy, whose ,
"run" was between that city and Port
Huron. They became f ast *â¢ friends. In
their later years whenever these two ex
trainboysâHugh Chisholm and Thomas
A. Edison â have chanced to meet they :
have recalled with pleasure the days when
they used to swap books and tales of ad
venture in their moments of leisure in
Detroit. .
Newsboys on the railways were then
paid by commissions on sales, as is the
case to-day; but young Chisholm, having
a keen ej'e for business, as soon as 'he
had accumulated a few surplus dollars.
Invested in a stock of his own. There
after his daily earnings were four times
as large as before. His next investment
was In a course in bookkeeping and pen
manship in a business college in Toronto,
he taking the Instruction on the weekday
evenings that he passed in that city and
studying at odd minutes on trains and
at the western terminus of his "run."
He next branched out as a commission
agent, getting control of the news routes
on the Grand Trunk Railway as far East
as Portland, Me., and taking his brothers
Into partnership.' The Chisholms contin
ued to acquire additional routes until in
1866 they had contracted to sell papers on
trains from Chicago to Portland and Hali
fax, and also in Northern New England,
Northern New York and far up into Can
ada, as well as on steamboat lines, their
routes having an aggregate length of
more than 5000 miles. . Their force of
newSboys In that year had increased to "
200. The Chisholms Inaugurated the use
of uniforms by employes on railway
trains, their news agents being the first
to wear brass buttons and regulation
caps. The system of uniforming conduc
tors and brakemen' was soon afterward
adopted by the railroad companies. Up
to that time they had had no distin
guishing mark in their dress except a
badge or lettered ribbon.
Hugh Chrisholm early in his career se
lected Portland as his place of residence
and there established the headquarters of
his business. In 1876 . he sold Â¦ out â¢ his
Canadian interests and purchased the in
terests of his brothers in the New Eflg
land States. Then in connection with his
news agency he established a publishing
business, turning out for sale by his own
agents picture albums, pamphlets,'tour
ists' guides and souvenir publications
descriptive of scenery along the principal
lines of railway in .the United States.
These publications were largely handled
by news agents on all transportation lines.
His last book of importance was illustra
tive of the World's Fair at Chicago.
Became Interested in 'Wood Fiber.
In the latter part of the '70s Mr. Chis
holm became Interested In an invention of
a Portland man, it being a wooden lamp
with a tin front. After experimenting for
a time with the manufacture of this lamp
from wood which was turned with a lathe
he conceived the idea of fashioning the
lamp from chemically prepared wood pulp.
In working out this plan the durability of
indurated fiber vessels was discovered. At
the experimental factory in Portland some
sample pails, tubs and other vessels were
fashioned from wood fiber, and the enter
prise gave promise of great success. Then
he established a factory for making in
durated fiberware in the town of Fairfleld,
but just as the business was emerging
from the experimental stage the Fairfleld
factory was burned and Mr. Chisholm met
Â¦with a severe financial loss. However, in,
company with some other Maine capital
ists he established a flberware plant at i
North Gorham, fifteen miles from Port
land, but the cost of building the water
power was so great that Mr. Chisholm be
came discouraged and sold out his in
terest In the enterprise. The business
turned out to be a paying venture.
About this time Mr. Chisholm. in con
sequence of the knowledge that ne naa
acquired in manufacturing Indurated
fiberware, became Interested In the wooa
pulp and paper Industry. With others he
organized the Somerset Fiber Company,
which established a $200,000 pulp mill on
the Kennebec River at Fairfield. He is still
a director In this company. In lwl ne
established at Ltvermore Falls, on the
Androscoggin River, the Umbagog pulp
mill, which cost $200,000. He was made
president and general manager or the
company. He was also the organizer,
treasurer, manager and chief stockholder
in the Otis Falls Pulp Company. This cor
poration was capitalized at $700,000. its
plant .on the Androscoggin was at tne
time of its construction one of the largest
in the United States, its daily output being
about eighty tons of paper such as Is used
in printing newspapers.
Developing a Great Water Power.
Appreciating the value of the unde
veloped water power on the Androscoggln
River at Rumford Falls. Mr. Chisholm, in
1892, in company with Charles D. Brown or
Boston and Waldo Pettengill of Rumford,
began quietly to buy tracts or land in tnai
vicinity. Rumford Falls was then an in
significant country village, and before the
townspeople discovered what Mr. cms
holm was "driving at" he and his asso
ciates had purchased, at practically their
own price, extensive tracts of forest on
either side of the river. The Androscog;
gin at that place has a total fall of lso
leet tn less than a mile, furnishing : the
year round a minimum of 42,000 norse-
P Â°In e the nine years that have passed sineÂ©
Mr. Chisholm and his associates made
those purchases of wild land Rumford
Falls has developed into one of the most
important manufacturing towns in Maine.
The census of 1900 credited the town with
898 residents; the population as shown by
the last census Is 3770. Â«_?'â,
Mr. Chisholm and his associates first or
ganized the Rumford Falls Power Com
pany, of which corporation he was made
treasurer and manager. Dams were built,
a system of canals was laid and other
preparations were begun to harness the
gigantic water power. Capitalists from
other States speedily became interested
in this great source of power, and soon
two big pulp manufacturing plants were
in process of construction. The Rumrora
Falls and Buckfield Railroad was then
being operated only between Mechanic
Falls and Canton, and Its projectors saw
no prospect of ever extending the line or
getting the road on a paying basis. Mr.
Chisholm purchased the road and its lim
ited equipment, organized a new corpora
tionâthe Portland and Rumford Falls
Railroad Company â built a new roadbed,
extended the line at both endsâ from Can
ton to Rumford Falls and from Mechanic
Falls to Auburn. The line was equipped
with modern steel bridges and first-class
rolling stock. Being principal owner of
the road, Mr. Chisholm became president
and general manager of the company.
-The Rumford Falls Paper Company
built the first pulp and paper mill In the
new village, and then the Rumford Falls
Sulphide Company established a large
plant there, Mr. Chisholm being elected
treasurer and a director of the corpora
tion. He was one of the lncorporators of
the Rumford Falls Woolen Company, the
Rumford Falls Light and Water Company
and the Rumford Falls Trust Company,
in all of which he has since remained a
director. The plant of the Oxford Paper
Company, now nearing completion. Is to
be the largest book paper manufactory in
the United States. Its cost Is said to be
$1,500,000. In the vicinity of these big pa
per mills have been erected lumber mills
and other smaller industries.
Organizing a Paper Trust.
Three years ago Mr. Chisholm was in
fluential in bringing about the organiza
tion of the International FaDer Company.
William A. Russell, one of the foremost
paper manufacturers of Massachusetts,
was also prominent in the project. The
corporation, capitalized at $55,000,000. made
short work of gathering into Its fold most
of the paper and pulp mills In New Eng
land. â¢ Mr. Russell was elected president
and Mr. Chisholm vice president of the
company. Upon the death of President
Russell the Maine paper manufacturer
was promoted to the presidency, with its
salary of 550,000 a year. His election to
that office necessitated his removal to
New York, but he has retained his home
on State street, Portland, and his family
passes the summer months there.
Mr. Chisholm has a fine face, a clear
complexion, white hair, piercing eyes and

Now, Mr. Editor, Senator Morgan advocates
the dlsfranchlsement of a race of people on
account of color. distinctly drawing tne
"color line" by which a man's rights are to
be determined regardless of character, com
petence, capacity, fitness to perform the du-
Uea enjoy the privileges or deceive the bless
ings of our free Institutions, of which we.
American people, all without regard to race,
color or former condition, are so fond of
boasting. , ..
The colored race did not originate In the
United States, they are not aborigines, but
were brought here, not willingly, bat by force,
by Senator Morgan's ancestors, and hence
they and not we. are responsible for our pres
ence' here: but. nevertheless, we are here and
It is a self-evident fact that we are here to
stay unless the Illustrious Senator and^ his
followers devise some "ways and means" by
which they can exterminate the race or trans
late the entire race to some clime- beyond tha
seas. ' . Â¦"'. A
Now. sir. we profess to be and are loyal to
the Government which has given us our lib
erty and guaranteed to us equal rights with,
other citizens of our country and now. to
deprive us or any of us of the rights of
franchise Is but to take from us the one vital
thing upon which all other rights and all lib
erty are founded.
Again this cannot and will not be done with
out taking from us our guaranteed rights un
der the constitution.
How is this for a man or set of raen. who
boast of their devotion to the constitution un
der which we live? Senator Morgan says:
"So I think the least said is the best Just
now." Secrecyâ why? Because. says he.
â¢"When things are coming our way there Is
no necessity of clamorous discussion." This
reminds me of the wily scheming and plotting
In the South in ante-bellum days, when we
were slaves and the leaders of the South were
all "agin the Government," and planning for
the destruction of the Union.
We protest against the disfranchlsexnsnt of
our race on account of color, we protest
against all secret schemes against the rights
and interests of a race of people wto are
human, who have ambitions, purposes and
alms in life as other people do. a people who
have helped and will still help to make up
the world's history, and will participate In
the great events which go to%nake this world
whatever it may be in the coming ages.
In the name of common humanity. In the
name of justice to and among all mankind,
give us a chance in the "battle of life" that
ia founded on Justice among men. and then If
we fall we must take the consequences, but
justice and right will prevail, sooner or later,
as it did (though long delayed) when the im

â¢ Emperor William inclines to the air rifle

lief that a piece of iron was thrown. The
Emperor is also convinced that Weiland
was a tool,- and in this conviction he is
sustained by his entourage.
Immediately after the preliminary In
vestigation is closed the evidence will be
sent to the* imperial court at Lelpsic,
whose president will come to Berlin at
Eastertide to confer with Herr von
Schoenstadt, Prussian Minister of Justice,
and with the Imperial Judicial Depart

sufficient grounds exist to begin a trial

- BERLJN, March 31.â There is the high
est authority for the statement that the
investigation into the causes of the attack
upon Emperor Â¦William by Dieterich Well
and Is still being vigorously pushed. The
imperial court at Lelpsic, which alone
can try cases of high treason, has sent
two officials to Berlin to assist in the in
vestigation, which is now directed chiefly
with a view to clearing up three points
not yet explained, namelyâ what company
Weiland | regularly frequented before the
attempt; whether he received orders from
plotters, particularly anarchists, socialists
or Anglophoebes, to carry out the at
tempt, having also in view what has be
come of the suspicious persons who were
seen near him just before it was made,
and what weapon was used by Weiland
or by some other person.
Evidence, tending 1 to throw light upon
these points has been accumulated, but it
is too slight to warrant indictment. The
question whether Weiland actually threw
ajlece of iron, as was at first alleged, or
some one fired a shot from an air rifle is
still unanswered to the satisfaction of the
authorities. â¢ â¢< - .

was decided to continue the strike until

At a later meeting some 300 dock foremen,
who had not hitherto joined the strike, de
cided to retuse to continue to work with
the improvised dock hands until the de

Â¦ ? . â
PAB1S, March 31.â The opposition news
papers assert that the Indisposition of
M. Waldeck-Rousseau, the Premier, is
diplomatic with a view of avoiding ac
companying President Loubet to Toulon
April 10. The theory is that the Premier,
owing to the proximity of Marseilles to
Toulon fears the Marseilles strikers who
are incensed at the refusal of the Gov
ernment to support them In the recent
strike, might organize a hostile demon
stration, either In Toulon or at some
point along the route.
Meanwhile the situation has not been
changed as a result of the conference be
tween the Premier and masters to-day.
The masters persist In their refusal to
discuss a day of eight hours, which has
all along been regarded by the strikers
as the crucial point In the dispute.
In epite of the increasing number of free
dockers now working, quantities of per
iehable goods He rotting on the docks.
Twenty-one steamers are awaiting dis
charge.
The general strike while it lasted and
the continued suspension of work has
done enormous Injury to the commerce
and Industry of Marseilles. The calcu
lations show an Industrial loss of some
25,000,000 francs, while the men have lost
more than 2,000,000 francs in wages. A
curious illustration of the bitterness
which the strike has engendered between
the men and the masters is seen in the
fact that the strikers instructed their del
egates to give formal notification to the
Minister of Finance of frauds in the oil
eeed trade, pointing out that oil 6eeds
were imported In bags which the custom
oOcIals have not been in the habit of
opening with the result that articles sub
ject to a much higher import duty are
smuggled In bags.
The commerce of Marseilles is for the
time being almost at a complete stand
still. Foodstuffs which are largely im
ported are now scarce. The prices of
sugar, coffee, flour and other necessary
articles have doubled. A number of fac
tories have been obliged to close. These
conditions, added to the serious damage
done by the floods and hail have thrown
the whole population Into deep misery.
The storekeepers and merchants intend
to appeal to the Government to remit the
taxes for the first three months of the
year.

POLICY'S VICTIM
Bourse Honey Scarce.
BERLIN, March 31.â The monthly set
tlement has passed off under a tighter
money market than usual, as well as
larger bull engagements than had been
expected. The husbanding of their re
sources by the banks for the imperial loan
caused a scarcity of money, and rates for
settlement purposes went as high as hVx
per cent. Nevertheless they eased up to
ward the end of the wee.k, and the private
rate of discount fell yesterday to 3%. Call
money was also easier.
The subscription of the Imperial loan
next "Wednesday is occupying great atten
tion. It is believed that the loan will be
heavily oversubscribed. Books will be
opened in all the German cities and also
at the London branches of the Deutsche
Bank. Already the Bourse has been liv
ened with the dealings in the scrip of the
loan. â¢
The Bourse regarded New York's boom
in railroad securities as exaggerated, con
sequently Berlin quotations lagged and
arbitrage made larger sales in New York,
causing further weakening in New York
exchange. The Bourse began the week
with a strong rise in coal and iron shares,
which was partly lost later. Nevertheless
the reports from U e iron centers continue
more favorable, showing a slight increase
In orders.
The week's movements in coal and iron
shares on the Bourse showed increases
ranging from five to fifteen points. The
outside public has begun buying both
classes of securities again, the German
excnange last week being strongly influ
enced jy Vienna and Wew York. . The
American Iron situation continues to be
sharply watched. Op'nions agree that im

LONDON, March 31.â The Stock Ex

dropping to $5%, although they subse

prospect of a material rise. If this con

the German level. The market, apart from
the American section, was not exciting.
There is no prospect of much activity in
the other markets until after the Easter
holidays, when, if money is cheap, things
may be more lively. Home railroad secu
rities, showed a general revival, many ad
vancing from one to three points, owing
partly to bear, realizations.
Business In Americans was conducted
on a considerable scale, interest in the
market increasing. Several cases showed
good' advances, although the best figures
were not always maintained, owing to

to become the wife of her youngest son.
Of course, she was previously told of the
engagement and her words to her son
then were characteristic of her sweet and
noble disposition. "Any woman that my
son loves and who is worthy of his love
shall be gladly welcomed by me."
at the dinner given by Mrs.
George Crocker to Mrs. Stuyvesant
Fish I could not Xielp but think what had'
been and what might be. I can't remem
ber back to the days when Hattie Crocker
was a belle, and the California-street
mansion was the scene of many brilliant
gatherings, but I've heard about them
and am convinced it is not because they
belong to the long. ago that they linger
in such gorgeous fashion in the memory
of some who were /.'among those present."
The Crocker mansion is still the hand
somest home for entertaining in the city.
In spite of the fact that the best in art
and furnishing that graced the house has
been taken away and distributed among
the members of the family, it is still a
gorgeous place. There is a faded splendor
about it that makes one think of grand
fathers and ancestors and such inspiring
things. I saw an immense Satsuma vase
standing guard to the left of the grand
staircase with a great three-cornered
chip knocked out of it. The chip lay on
the supporting stand, and it had prob
ably reposed there for many years, for
the break had that yellowed look of an
tiquity.
The Crocker dinner, however, did more
than show to -the Eastern visitors the
splendor of the host's ancestors. It was
a sort of .ceremonious proclamation of the
amicable coming together of the two sis
ters-in-law. It* Is not so many years
since that Mrs. George and Mrs. Will
scarcely recognized each other as they
passed by, and it is still fewer years back
when they met face to face at Del Monte,
each with the identically same style coat
on, even to the size, number and color of
the buttons.
It was an awful time. Mrs. George had
ordered the swellest coat taste could dic
tate and money purchase. Mrs. Will had
given a similar order, but unfortunately
not to the same firm. In. due course of
time the garments were delivered. They
were unpacked and admired, and then
for some unaccountable reason, which
some people call fate, both ladles decided
to wear their respective coats on the very
same day. They met on the piazza in the
presence of their many respective friends.
It was a terrible thing. I believe, though,
that Mrs. Will was mistress of the very
trying situation. Mrs. George, I have
been told, retired in tears. However,
neither of the ladies ever appeared in
those coats again.
SOCIETY: CROCKER DINNER CALLS

NEVER realized, until the other night,
how truly sad it is that the old Crock
er mansion is habitually dark and

"According to Prussian traditions," he
continued, "only the winning of a battle
or the capturing of a first-rate fortress
entitles one to that honor. This has not
been vouchsafed to me, but in my own
vindication I can say that for twelve
years I have worked on the army to the
utmost of my power, and I think I have
succeeded in keeping it up to the level of
its past.
"In a few years I hope to be strong
enough at sea to secure respect for the
name of Germany throughout: the world.
This new offensive flank which I am
building on the army by means of a pow
erful fleet will place Germany in, a posi
tion to defy all danger, no matter when
a combination may- be . formed against
her." .,:*. /
His Majesty then proceeded to say that
for a long time, and in deference to the
solicitation of Field Marshals Prince Al
brecht. Count von Blumenthal and Count
von "Walderse?, he had considered the
question of assuming the grade of field
marshal.
"At that time the position I should as
sume with reference to the army was hid
den in the mist of the future. To-day no
doubt is possible on this point. I may
say that since the "command of the army
has devolved upon me I have exercised it
and drilled it so that when I put it to a
trial I may feel secure and certain that it
will not fail me." .

GRANT SMITH WINS >/Â¦;' &>
HANDICAP TOURNAMENT
1>efeats Harold â¢ Crowell in the
Finals in Two Straight
Sets. â¢ Y'-!:-
A large crowd Â¦was Â¦ on hand yesterday
at the California Tennis Club to witness
the handicap singles tournament, which
was won in clever style by Grant Smitli.
Smith had for his opoonent in the finals
Harold Crowell, whom , he defeated with
out a struggle, the score being 6â 0, Bâ 1.
.There was only one match In the pre
liminary round, which was won by Harry
Young, who defeated Charles.: Kuehn on
even Â¦ terms â 6 â 3, .6 â 3. Â¦ The -winner played
a very steady game, while his opponent
was slightly- off in 'his play. r The first
match of the first round was "between
Richard Erskine and Louis Delano. 'These
players met on even Â¦â terms and . Erskine
won easilyâ ftâ 3, 6â1. -The next match
was between Grant Smith, and Harry
Young, in which 'Â» the latter received odd.;
of thirty and one-half fifteen.- Young 1 was
suffering from stage fright and Jjis oppo
nent -won easilyâ 6â 2, 6â2. R./N. WhU
ney next played Harold Crowell, whom he
allowed a handicap of fifteen, and after
having the first set â * â 1 â finally lost. The
score in Crowell' s favor Â¦was ,9 â 7... 6 â 2.
The .next match was rather a surprise, as
Ray Crowell, allowing odds of. fifteen to
Sidney. Salisbury, looked to be a winner,
but the latter won- rather- easily â 6 â 1,
6â 3. - :..:â¢. -. -- , . Â¦'. .
In the seroi-flnal round Smith' allowed
Erskine odds of thirty and one-half fif
teen, and after a fierce struggle , won.
The score in Smith favor was 1 â 6,' 6 â 1.
6 â 1.- After the first set it looked as it
Smith had not a chance, but he steadied
down and , finallv won out. The other
match of the semi-finals was between Sal
isbury and Crowell. The latter allowed
his opponent half thirty and won easilyâ
6â1, Â«â 3.
In the final match Crowell was given a
handicap on- Smith, but, preferred to
play him on even terms. The outcome was
never in doubt, as 'Crowell was able to ob
tain i only one game in two sets. Smith
played a remarkably good game and had
his opponent taken the handicap of half
fifteen the- match would probably have
been - very . close. ' I*rizes were given to
Smith and Crowell.

MAZES STSONG PEOTEST
AGAINST THE BOYCOTT
W. H. Currier "Writes a I*stter in Ex
planation of the Basaball
Club Trouble. .
All the trouble over the union standing -
of the San Francisco Baseball Club ia
laid, in the following communication, at
the feet of P. H. McCarthy, one of the
Civil Service Commissioners and the
president of the Building Trades Council:
EDITOR THE CALL: As I was the first one
in the San Francisco Labor Council to oppose
the acilon of P. H. McCarthy In seeking to boy
cott the San Francisco Baseball League, will
you permit me an explanation through your
columns?
On the evening of Friday, March 15. a dele
sate from the Varnishers' and Polishers' Union
Informed' the Council that owing .to the fact
that Henry Harris, manager and part owner
of the San Francisco Baseball Club, had em
ployed non-union help on hia cigar store la
making alterations and Improvements, through
the West Coast Furniture - Company, he re
quested the delegates to Teport to their respect
ive unions that the California Baseball League
be declared unfair when the San Francisco
Baseball Club played.
On motion made by myself the matter t as
referred to the executive board to taÂ»e action
on the following Wednesday evening. I began
an investigation at once and established these
facts:
Firstâ That the contract let to the "West Coast
Furniture Company was not let by Mr.' Harris,
but by his partner. Mr. Goodman, and that he
was ignorant until after the contract was
signed that the West Coast Furniture Company
Secondâ That Mr. Harris specified in the con
tract let for the work done on the ball grounds
that Bald work must be done by union labor :
Thlrd-That Mr. Harris was the owner' of
but one-third of the San Francisco Baseball
Club; that the other two-thirds were owned by
T. F. Bonnet and E. Bert, both strong union
supporters, and in no way connected with Mr
Harris in the cigar and tobacco business, and
that a boycott on the San Francisco Baseball
Club would be an Injury to Mr. - Bonnet and
Mr. Bert, both Innocent parties to the grievance
of the Varnlshers* and Polishers' Union
Fourth-That as a matter of fact the' entire
matter emanated from the fertile brain of P
Â£â¢ c ?,^ thy *^. who had U8ed his Position hi
the Building Trades to vent his per
sonal and political spite, not on Harris but
on Bonnet, who had assailed him and his do

evening: Alter the officers of the league haa

Hitting by Hank's sacred number won
the game. They began It in the early
stages, and wound up the pyrotechnics
with a square piece by Josh i Reilly in
the ninth inning, when he losjt the ball
over t'he right Held fence, ana, cantered
around the bags "amid the wildest demon
onstrations of the populace, suddenly, gone
mad."
Two presentations proved the mascot
for the local team in yesterday's game,
although little Theophrastus Suchâ calle-l
Jimmy Gallagher on week daysâ was theve
to pick up. the sticks and cause consterna
tion in the Senatorial ranks. When Hilde
brand stepped to the plate he was hand
ed a couple ' of bats fancifully joined
with resplendent ribbons. A safe hit fol
lowed, of the bunt order. Then came
Schwartz to the bat, and he was given
a stick with a breastplate tacked on that
was full of -fraternal inscription.' Schwartz
rolled out a three-bagger to far left field.
After that Doyle was so easy that, it
seemed a positive shame for the rejuven
ated Wasps in real nice new clothes an.l
gray military jacket to consume so
much of his earnest, honest offerings.
In this first inning, which ended with
four clangs for the local team, Krug got
a single and Pabst a double. Holland,
who reached, first in safety but forced
Krug out at second, rwas one of those
! Sacramento did something in this Inn
ing, but Iburg, who pitched a good.^care
ful game, did not sparkle until later in
the day. Devereaux, the first up, struck
out, and Sheehan, Â¦ who traveled to the
first station on a pass, was wrecked at
the middle bag by Graham's fine throw.
Eagan; who was safe at first on an error
' by Schwartz, crossed the , rubber when
'Courtney, let loose a long drive to right
field. Courtney did not reach' the thinl
bag on his hit, being caught between that
sack and the second by Schwartz's clever
throw. The- second inning and the ninth
gave Frisco bunches Â¦ of runs on long
hits. The Senators chased the spheroid
over the far away fields," arid .the i Wasps
jogged around the bags for bell ringing
by the scorer. *, -'â¢
Iburg displayed his old-time coolness
â¢and his good pitching strength in the
fourth inning.: Eagan, Courtney and
Hanlon choked the three sacks, and no
Senator had as yet been buried. Mr>-
Laughlin was at the plate, and after six
fouls over the fences and into the stands
he died on an infield fly. Then Doyle
flew to Jagger, but Eagan scored on tho
throw in. That was all the Senatoi s
could put through the house.
Of Hank's new men, Holland gives
promise of being just the 'proper thing.
Josh- Reillr, who was usedat thlrjd tem
norarily. made a good showing in tie fiel'1
and with the stick. J agger was njrvou.',
off color and has oceans of room :or im
provement. Â¦ Â¦

HANDBALL THAT WAS
EXCITING AND CLOSE
Beginning of the Olympic Doubles
Tournament in tfie Club
Courts. \
That the game of handball has a firm
hold on the members of the Olympic Club
was evidenced yesterday by the large
crowd that watched the opening games of
the doubles tournament. Counter attrac
tions were many. but. the devotees of the
great Irish game were there in numbers
and were as enthusiastic as a band of
youngsters just out of school. Some bril
liant games were played by the contest
ants, but the most exciting contest of the
day was that between Jack Gleason and
Louis Levy against Judge A. J. Fritz and
Matt Breen. The former team won the
rally by a score of 51 to 49. . â¢
Despite the fact that Gleason had played
eight games in the morning and was suf
fering from a bad knee, he went into the
game with a determination to win. Fritz
and Breen were seventeen points in the
lead at the outset of the game, but
Gleason and Levy pulled themselves to
gether and not only made it "up sticks,"
but passed them. Then Fritz and Breen
played hard and tied Gleason and Levy at
48. With three points to go, the players
buckled down to closer work. The spec
tators were deeply interested in the out
come and keenly watched the play. Fritz
and Breen -were retired Â¦without making
a point, and then Gleason and Levy se
cured two. Gleason tried to "kill" the
ball, but failed, and then Fritz and Breen
entered again, but Â¦were quickly retired.
The winning team managed to secure an
other point, and so did Fritz. The game
was now 50 to 49. Gleason was put out on
the first toss.. Levy then tried, and in his
anxiety to make the point tossed the ball
twice among the spectators. He sent out
a difficult ball to Fritz, and the latter re
turned it to the front wall. Gleason ended
things by a low smash. .
Johnny â¢ Mallon and Jack Talt were
awarded a game-through the 'default, of
Oatie Crable, who was to have .played
with Billy Kennedy. Henry Russ and
Tom Kennedy outclassed J. K. Burke and
Gus Ebner, beating them by a score of
51 to 30. Bobby Bowman and T. Curley
had an easy time with Billy Cartwright
and L. V. Starr. The tetter played in poor
form and Â¦ the brunt of the work fell on
Cartwright. The score was 51 to 25. Nat
Hewson and A. Duffy defeated Phil New
man and A. Pockwitz in a close struggle.
Hewson sent out a low hard toss that was
hard to' solve. Newman was too eager '
and tried to play the entire game. Had j
he given his clever partner more of a
chance they might have won out. Score 51
to 47.
â¢ To-morrow night the following games
will be played : Guy Ransome and Max

LUXOR FIRST IN
THE OPEN STAKE
Beats Palo Alto, the Favor
ite, in a Short Run for
Final Honors.
Good Programme of Coursing at
Union Park â T&lent Was in"
Luck, "Winning All but
Seven- Events. '
In a short course, so short. In fact, that
the game was dispatched and a decision
rendered before the contesting hounds had
been given a chance to show their rela
tive merits. Curtis & Son's Luxor beat
Eugene Geary's Palo Alto for final honors
in the open event yesterday at Union
Park.
Palo Alto had the call and was made
favorite in the last go at 2\i to 1, despite
the fact that he had done more work than
his opponent. Without detracting from
the winner's creditable showing the result
was entirely unsatisfactory as a test.
With another minute added the crowd
â¢would have been better pleased.. As it
was, Luxor's colors were flying before the
enthusiasts had time to work up an ex
citement.
That Palo Alto earned the right to con
test for the last flag was due to the fact
that luck favored the champion a bit at
the outset. In the morning, against Im
ported Representative, Geary's courser
had about a6 close a game as he could
stand without losing tne flag. The for
eigner had him not going but gone. The
score stood 8 to G, with the small figure
the home dog's total, and both hounds
close to the nare. A quick kill by the
black and white sprinter evened matters,
and the talent orew a long breath. When
the travelers came to the run-off the fa
vorite went in and hurried things, winning
by a score of 7 to 3.
Warship, last week's winner, looked for
awhile liKe a. repeater. He beat Daisy
Clair, Roman Athlete and Hot HastÂ« in
turn and then iost to Palo Alto only after
a close race to the hare, f alo Alto leading
a length.
Laay Clare, considering her poor work
in the run-down, did well to reach the
nfth round. She was beaten by Ireland
utter shewing equal speed to tne game,
he getting the turn by iavor. Rural Artist
jogged along in fine style, in the lilth
round he got an undecided with Mose and
then beat him out. The extra work was
his undoing and he lost to irÂ»alo Alto in
the s>emI-hnaL
The form players had a good day, call

ends were: Honor tJrignt beat Flying

The attendance was light at the Shell
Mound range yesterday, but in spite of
the small number of contestants, the
scores were exceptionally good. The chief
event of the day. from point of interest,
was the shooting of Company A, Fifth
Infantry, National Guard of California,
selected members of which competed with
a picked team of crack shots from the
University of California.
, Ten men from each organization were
chosen to compete for â¢ honors. The
Spring-field rifle was used and the shoot
ing: was at 200 yards at a Blunt target.
The university men shot Saturday on ac
count of regulations forbidding them to
contest on Sunday and the Company A
men were unable to be present until yes
terday, so the contest had to be divided.
The colleee boys won by a margin of 13
points with a total of 428 against 415 points
made by their opponents. . -.' , v

Sly had a game leg or something: of UB3<

news now, but Turner, pilot of the choker,

The initial live bird shoot . of

fly from the trap and had to be relegated
to the care of the retriever. Clean scores
were made by Thomas, Bonner, Lasseret
and King. Along with the club shoot a
side pool . was arranged and the Â¦ above
named marksmen were awarded first
prize. Second prize went to Walsh, Jones,
Shields, Klevesahl, Gomez and Feudner
while the third reward fell to the lot of
Rickie and Joseph.

who will have succeeded. in, making the
highest scores throughout the tournament

the possessor of a handsome pair of cuff
buttons. The prize will be presented to
the winner at the final shoot September
29. All ties arising during the contest will
be decided by lot or at the option of- the
contestants. .

OMAHA, Nebr., March 31.â There Is
such a clamor to induce Governor Charles
H. TJHetrich to retain the office of Gover
nor till .December that he has decided to
do so. This has caused a protest from
Lieutenant " Governor Savage and ' his
friends, who say the Governor has bÂ«en
induced to hold the office by powers be
hind the throne which have little confi
dence In Savage's ability. As The Call
has previously announced. Savage says
the attitude of the Governor is discredit
ing him before the people. .
Savage's partisans are now making the
charge that Governor Dietrich does not.
intend ever to quit the Governorship, but
will next fall resign his seat In the
United States Senate and appoint D. E.
Thompson to the vacancy. There appears
to be some foundation for this story, and
it is creating a decided sensation In high
Republican circles.
Thompson and Dietrich are warm per
sonal friends and Thompson spent money
freely to aid Dietrich's election. The lat
ter has said openly that he thought
Thompson entitled to the Senatorial toga.

NEW YORK, March" 31.â The World
has this from Washington: - The train
on which President McKinley will travel
to the Pacific Coast to witness the
launching of the battleship Ohid is ready.
It consists of six Pullman coaches.
Inasmuch as the President was invited
to California by the citizens of that State
they probably will pay a part of the ex
penses of the train. There is no one In
Washington to-night who can speak for
California on this matter. The President
always pays his own expenses on a trip
of this kind and those of Mrs. McKlnley
and his secretary. The train will not
be kept as a Presidential train, but the
cars will be put Into general use by the
Pullman Company as soon as they are
relinquished by tho Presidential party.
The first car from the engine will be a
combination baggage car. barber shop, li
brary and smoking compartment. The sec
ond will be the dining car. The third will
be a compartment car for the members of
the Cabinet and their families. The
fourth will be the office car, containing
all the equipment essentlonal to the trans
action of business and a corps of clerks,
typewriters and stenographers. The of
ficial seal will be at hand and every other
convenience necessary to the transaction
of public business. In the business office
of the train will be two of the White
House telegraphers.
The fifth will be the private car of the
President and Mrs. McKlnley. It will be
magnificently fitted up with compart
ments, sitting room, parlor, bathroom and
every other luxury.
The sixth will be used by the cor
respondents, clerks, stenographers, pho
tographers and secretaries to Cabinet of
ficers. It will be a compartment car with
kitchen, a few staterooms and a dining
room in the center, Into which berths will
be let down at night.

The Republicans secured control of the
new City Council at 1 o'clock this morn
ing, by a brilliant coup, and Immediately
organized by electing Louis Schaffer pres
ident of the Council and Rod W. Church
City Clerk. : -
' The old Council went out of office at
midnight and a few minutes later Mayor
Anson Barstow received a written opinion
from City Attorney C. A. Johnson that
G. T. Burtchaell, Councilman-elect at
Large on the Municipal League Ticket,
and Councilman-elect James Smilie, also
a Municipal Leaguer, 'were disqualified.
Burtchaell's disqualification, according to
the opinion, was owing to the fact that he
resides In the same ward as C A. Bon.
who was -elected at large on the Republi
can ticket.
The charter says that no two Coundi
men at large may reside in the samÂ»
ward, and as Bon received the most votes
his election stands, while Burtchaell's
does not.
Smilie is held to be disqualified because
he has not been a registered voter in Oak
land for three years.
Mayor Barstow Immediately appointed
two Republicansâ TV. P. Courtney. Cotfn
cilman at large, vice Burthchaell, and A.
"W. Bishop, vice Smilleâ ar.d then called a
meeting of tho Council, which was held
at 1 o'clock this morning. The organiza
tion was Quickly perfected and an ad
journment taken until 2 o'clock this aft
ernoon. The Council now stands:

questions with the Republicans. The Re
publicans have a working majority and
quorum, and Burtchaell and Smille can
only obtain seats by getting a court de
cision seating them, which the best au
thorities say they will not be able tp da.
as the Mayor in appointing Courtney and
Bishop acted within the law".

NATIONAL PARK OPPOSED
BY TENNESSEE'S GOVERNOR
KXOXVILLE. Tenn., March 31.â R. W.
Austin, United States Marshal, who ha3
been In Nashville working on the bill to
cede mountain lands of East Tennessee
for a national Appalachian park, says
Governor McMillin Is opposing the b'll,
and will veto it if it passes. The bill, pro
poses ceding many thousands of acres of
lands in East Tennessee counties for tha
national park. The greater part of the
proposed park, which will contain 'about
2,000,000 acres, will lie In North Carolina.
â¢ Mr. Austin says Governor McMillin op
poses the Appalachian park bill because
in his opinion the State of " Tennessee
would be required to cede too much ter
ritory to the authority of the United
States, as fully one-fourth of the proposed
park would be within the boundaries of
tU State. V

SWEDISH REPUBLICAN

The Swedish-American Republican Club

The American ship Eclipse and the
French four-masted bark Cap Horn were
both ready for sea yesterday, but did
not sail. The vessels were detained from
very different reasons, but both captains
consider they have just cause for anger.
The Cap Horn is a water ballast vessel
and came here from Iquique with about
1500 tons of coal aboard. She was char
tered to load wheat for Europe and went
to Port Costa for her cargo. When It
came to measuring her capacity the sur
veyors took her water tanks into account
and only allowed her to take so much
grain. The quantity allowed did not bring
her down to within two feet of her load,
and Captain Hamon demanded more
cargo. Then the underwriters stepped In
and refused to insure the ship and cargo
if any more grain was put aboard. The
Cap Horn is in the stream, ready to sail
as soon as the matter is adjusted, but it
looks as if the owners are going to be out
about $2000 in freight money, owing to the
surveyors refusing to allow her to load
to what the captain considers her full
C The Eclipse is detained owing to the
fact that the Chinese who were to go
north on her to work in the canneries did
not appear. The ship was to have gone
to sea yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, but
at- that hour only about twenty . out or
two hundred and fifty had appeared.
The majority of the Mongolians had re
ceived an advance on their wages, and
somebody will be money out of pocket if
the men do not put in an appearance to
day. A rumor has got around Chinatown
that every ChinesÂ© who goes north this
year must be vaccinated, and as the fish
ermen are afraid of the operation nearly
all have gone into hiding. They will be
hunted up and put aboard.
Steamship Curacao Arrives.

Â¦ Richards makes emphatic denial of the
report more or less circulated in certain
quarters about getting ' his position

McKenzie-Noyes receivership faction.
"Such a report, so far as my friends
are concerned ". Richards said, "IsÂ«hardly
Â¦worth noticing. -and I only make the
denial with a view to setting right those
who do not know me or may be preju
diced by the 6tories. I belong to no Nome
or other Alaska faction and I propose
to show' no partiality or favoritism for
any man or combination of men. My ad
ministration of the office will speak for
itself, and on my record as Marshal I
am willing to stand or falL

second division of the Alaska district.
This comprises what Is generally termed
Northwestern Alaska. It takes in Dutch
Harbor, Unalaska, the Kuskikwim and
from the headwaters of the latter river
to the Arctic, including also the Koyo
kuk. My official headquarters will be at
St. Michael, though I shall, of course,
spend most of my time in the more popu
lated district of Nome. The second di
vision is allowed several regular or office
deputy 'marshals and such special depu
ties as are required. . In fact, every
United States Court Commissioner is ex

MARSHAL OVER I
LIVELY ALASKA
BOSTON, March 3Lâ President TV. J.
Tucker of Dartmouth College took tho
Christian church to task for its part in
the Chinese troubles I during the -Lenten
sermon at the Old South Church this
evening. His strongest sentences were
these:
"The very apostles sent forth by the
church have shown they do not know how
to keep the ten commandments. In China
it looks as though the gospel was sus
pended as well as the law. The Christian
church has been set back, nobody knows
how far, by the behavior of the mission
aries in China."
His subject was "The College Graduate
and the Church." He asked what attrac
tiveness the church has been for the
student In these days of great material
wealth. He answered it by saying that
fhe need was a plain matter of fact
morality. The last century was one of
missionary activity, yet at its close its
work was discredited. It is a time of
moral confusion also. We must expect
the failure of Christendom to support
Christianity."
Christian Church Alleged by Speaker
to Hava Been Largely Bespon
â¢ sible for the Recent
Troubles in China.

confident that they will promptly order
her released.
Woman Is Suing for Divorce and Un
successful Effort Is Made to
Prevent Attorney Seeing
Her.
Lacked In a padded cell In the Receiving
Hospital is an elderly woman named Mag
pie McLachlan. 6he Is charged with in
<=ar.-;ty. although the doctors, unanimously
declare that she Is mentally'sound.
Mrs. McLachlan lives at 1024 Sanchez
street. About a week ago she entered
divorce proceedings against her husband,
alleging extreme cruelty. On learning of
his wife's action, it is claimed, McLachlan
!ost no time in swearing to a warrant*
charging his better half with insanity;
J,ast Friday afternoon the unfortunate
woman was dragged from her home by a
policeman and locked up in the detention
ward of the Receiving Hospital. As soon
as her friends learned that she was
charged with insanity they went to the
hospital but were denied the privilege of
peeing her. Deputy County Clerk O'Neil,
who seems to have % akfn an unusual in
terest In the case, stood in the corridor
and firmly refused to allow anybody to
ppeak to the unfortunate woman-
Attorney Archie Campbell, who was em
ployed by the friends of Mrs. McLachlan
to prevent her from being railroaded to an
insane asylum, late Saturday night visited
the hospital and demanded to see her.
He was met by O'Neil. who emphatically
informed him that under no consideration
could he speak to Mrs. McLachlan. After
beir.p threatened that County Clerk Deane
would be communicated with otherwise.
O'Neil reluctantly allowed Campbell to see
tf'e unfortunate woman.
AVith tears streaming down her cheeks
Mrs. McLachlan begged the attorney to
have her released.
"I am not crazy," pitifully exclaimed the
l-.elpless woman. "For God's sake take me
out of here or I will go mad."
She declared that her husband had
caused her arrest for insanity in order to
defeat her suit for divorce.
The MeLachlans were married about
fifteen years ago In Edinburgh, Scotland.
Since their marriage, 6he alleges, he has
been in the habit of abusing her, even to
the extent of striking her in the presence
of her friends.
McLachlan is employed as a ship car
penter by the Risdon Iron Works. As he
oarr.s $90 a month Mrs. McLachlan. in her
complaint, asks that he be compelled to
pay her alimony.
Mrs. McLachlan will be examined by
the Commissioners and her friends are

Sunday at Pleasure Places.
Though the sun was not under cover it
was chilly work seeking pleasure at the
park and beach yesterday. In view of the
condition of the weather the crowds were
fairly large and proportionately orderly.
No important arrests nor startling inci
dents were renorted during the day. At
the Chutes a lage crowd enjoyed the many
features. New attractions are added to
the Chutes b.'ll every week, and its
patrons keep this fact in mind. The crowd
at Sutro baths was entertained by the
usual aquatic contests. Following are the
results: Fifty-yard race â C. Sundburg
first, J. Rasmy second. Under water
swimming contest â H. Hines first, J. Ras

on yesterday afternoon by Policemen
Holmes, Dinan and Silver on a charge of
robbery.
Victor M. Figueroe, a musician, was on
his way home Saturday morning between
2 and 3 o'clock, and at the corner of
Hinckley alley and Pinckney place a
young man approached him and ordered
him to throw up his hands. Figueroe was
so surprised that he did not respond at
once and the robber struck him a vicious
hiow on the chin, which knocked him
Â«1qwÂ»i. He was stunned for a moment,
during which the robber went through his
pockets, taking his watch and about $5
in cash.
When Figueroe recovered from the blow
he yelled for help and the robber ran.
Kigueroe's cries were heard by the three
officers, and Holmes happened to see An
trim running in the direction of Dupont
street. He pursued and soon overtook
him, and as Figueroe had disappeared by
the time he returned to Hinckley alley
with Antrim he took him to the City
Prison and locked him up in the "tanks."
Holmes did not ascertain till yesterday
Figueroc's address, and he took Antrim
to his house and Figueroe at once identi
fied him. He also identified as his prop
erty the watch which Holmes found in
Antrim's pockets when he searched him
at the City Prison. Antrim says it is a
case of .mistaken identity, but he falls to
give a satisfactory explanation of his
possession of Figuproe's watch, which is
only a nickel-plated affair. , â¢ * ' :
ELEVATOB BOY CHABGED

Accused of Stealing a Watch and
Coin From Victor M. Figueroe,
Musician.
John E. Antrim, an elevator boy in the
Russ House, was booked at the City Prls-
ficers of the vessel will have some inter
esting tales to tell. On her last trip from
the coast the vessel took away 545 Porto
FUcans for the sugar plantations. During
the trip two deaths, one birth, thrc>
marriages and one divorce occurred. The
deaths occurred 6oon- after the vessel left
port, and the birth occurred on St- Pat
rick's day. Dr. Waverly Clark at once
named the youngster Zcalandia Patricia
Dqminls, and is so recorded in the
ship's log.
The weddings occurred on March Â¦ 21, 22
and 23. - and Captain Dowdell officiated.
The first couple consisted of Ramon Pa
tinao and Ana Muniz. They had no soon
er secured their certificate than Francisco
Beauchamps ar.d Mariana Pagan wanted
the knot tied. Thev were married on
March 22, and the next day Lorenzo
Jimenez and Dolores Beauchamps were
made one. Then there was a general rush
to marry and give in marriage, and the
gallant captain had to cry -a halt. The
cause of the epidemic was soon, learned.
After each ceremony Chief Steward Seeley
gave a little dinner to the wedding party,
and as the Porto Ricans dearly love a.
feast everybody on beard was willing to
get married in order to get some of the
good things. ": *â¢
In the divorce case Dr. "VVaverly Clark.
Purser Thomas McCombe and Chief Stew
ard Joseph Seeley eat as judges. The
woman easily proved that her husband
had treated her in a most cruel manner,
so the divorce was granted. The day be
fore the Zcalandia reached Honolulu the
divorced woman wanted Captain Dowdell
to marry her to another member of the
company. The captain gravely told her
that according- to the laws of California
she Â¦would have to wait a year before she
could marry again. Then the fair Porto
Rican made the lives of Messrs. Mc-
Combe. Clark and Seeley miserable every
time she found them on deck by making
demands for the return of her ex-hus.-

SPIRITUAUCSTS MEET
IN ANNUAL SESSION
Jolui Marshall Is Compelled to Re
sign by '.Chief of Police
Sullivan.
John Marshall, who for several months
has been driving the patrol wagon at
the Stanyan-street station, is no longer a
member of .the police force. Saturday
night Chief Sullivan â¢ sent . for ' him and
promptly relieved him of his star. Mar
shall was then made to .write his resigna
tion and told that his services were no
loneer needed. â¢ â¢
Just what prompted Sullivan to relieve
Marshall Of his star the head of the Po
lice Department refuses to say. When
spoken to yesterday he was at first re
luctant to discuss' the matter, but finally
admitted that Marshall had been forced
to resign. As to why he relieved him of
his star Sullivan was as dumb as the pro
verbial oyster. . Â¦
i "I don't want to be questioned about
the matter," he testily remarked. .. "He
has resigned and that is all there is
to It."
Captain Wittman was also present when
Sullivan demanded Marshall's star, but
acting under instructions from his supe
rior he refuses to say anything about the
matter. "
"You will have to see the Chief," said
Wittman. "I know nothing about it."
Marshall is equally reticent and em
phatically refuses to disclose the reason
why the Chief forced- him to give up his
star. â¢
