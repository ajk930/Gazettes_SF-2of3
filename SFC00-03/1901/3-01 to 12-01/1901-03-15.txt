Count de Castellan* interpreted & para
graph In the Figaro as alluding to him.
He was accompanied by his father, the
Marquis de Castellan? . and a newspaper
friend, M. Morel. They proceeded to thÂ«
residence of M. de Rodays. In the Rue de
la Chausse d'Antln. situated In the center
of Paris. The Count asked to see M. de
Rodays. and was ushered Into the writer's
study. M. de Rodays later received the
party In his dressing room. Count da
Castellane said:
"You published In the Figaro this morn
ing an abominablo paragraph against
me."-
M. de Rodavs replied that he did not
understand what the Count meant, to
which the latter retorted hotly:
"Will you retract or not?"
Count Boni as a Slapper.
To this M. de Rodays repllsd by ex
plaining that the paragraph was courte
ously couched and that no mention waa
made of the name of Count de Castellane.
Then, without further ado. Count de Cas
tellane boxed M. de Rotlaya* ears severely
and repeatedly.
M. de Rodays. who was seated, recoiled,
and M. de Castellane followed him up and
siapped his face severely.
The Marquis de Castellane and M. Morel
then Interposed and protected M. de Ro
days from further violence. The De Cas
tellane party then withdrew.
M. de Rodaya later in the day said he
had decided to send seconds to Count
Bonl de CasteHane.
The affair Is the sensation of Paris.
Since the speech of M. Deroulede at San
Sebastian last month. In which he Inti
mated that the Royalists of Paris had
notified the police of his attempted coup
d'etal. after his refusal to allow the Duke
of Orleans to appear In the rank* of the
ajritators. very great Interest has been
aroused respecting the Identity of tha
Royall3t emissary who approached M. De
roulede and M. MarceV-Hebert on that
occasion, the names suggested Including
Jules Guerln, the hero of Fort Chabrol.
while the Royalists denied that the emis
sary acted In behalf of them.
Arrange for a Duel.
The duel arranged to take place pesstbly
to-day or to-morrow near LansannÂ«.
Switzerland, between M. Deroulede and
M. Buffet, the agent of the Duke of Or
l'eans, is a direct outcome of the discus
sion on the subject of the coup d'etat
which failed.
The paragraph In the Figaro, which was
the immediate cause of the assault upon
M. de Rodaya. was as follows:
"People have been asking who Is thÂ»
person M. Deroulede wished to designate.
It appears that he Is a member of Par
liament, and it Is affirmed that be Is the
young Deputy whose name Is best known
and who. on the eve of starting for Amer
ica with his young wife last week, very
loyally delayed his departure In order to
reply, if necessary, to the polemics which
may develop."
Count de Castellane was Interviewed
to-day at his residence on the Avenue du
Rois de Boulogne, on his return from the
residence of M. de Rodays. He said:
i "Yes. I boxed M. de Rodays" ears sev
eral times In the presence of my father
and M. Morel, who is editor of the Jour
nal de Castellane." They are here now.
and can give you particulars of the Inci
dent.

I move that the court now adjourn until

The opinion, which is written by Justice
Garoutte and concurred in by Chief Jus
tice- Beatty, and Justices McFarland, Van
Dyke, Henshaw and Temple, then quotes
section 27 of the Penat'Code and proceeds
to refute arguments of counsel for appel
lant in detail. " " >-. i â¢
Defendant has been convicted of. the crime
of murder and prosecutes this Â¦ appeal. The
charge of the court given to the Jury upon the
law contained declarations which were held
to be unsound and constitute reversible error,
in People vs. VerenesiinckocHoQkhoff, 189 Cal.,
437. In view of the ikgjfian in that case the
Attorney General cone jup* JtbÂ«t 'the judgment

ment of the lower court upon the ground
that the Instructions given the jury in the
case were similar to those in the cases of.
Hoft and Brandes, who were awarded new
trials.
25 In the Hoff case the Supreme Court re
versed the judgment of the lower court
upon the ground that Judge Cook had In
, his- instructions to the jury gone beyond
the limit by dealing too much with the
facts and the Importance of circumstan
tial evidence. '
The decision of the Supreme Court set
tles an important point, however. Mrs.

Justice Garoutte In the opinion filed

For the purpose of testing this claim of
lack of Jurisdiction In the courts of California
to try defendant the facts of this case . may
be deemed as follows: Defendant. Jn the city
and county of San Francisco, State of Cali
fornia, sent . by ths United States mall to
Klizabeth Dunning of Dover, Delaware, a box
of poisoned candy, with Intent that Â»ald Eliza

death be caused thereby. The candy was re
ceived by the party to whom addressed, she
partook thereof and her death was the result.
Upon these facts may the defendant be charged
and tried for the crime of murder in the courts
of the State of California? We do not find
it necessary to declare what the true rule may
be at common law upon this state of facts,
for, in our opinion, the statute of. this State
is broad enough to cover a case of the kind
here dlscloHed. There can be no question
that the Legislature of this State had the
power to declare that the acts hera pictured

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March 14.â In a Joint caucus to
night the question of apportionment was
settled for this session by a decision to
stand by the original Senate' bill which
leaves San Eenlto an Assembly district
by itself. The Assembly amended the bill
so as to link San Benlto with Monterey
In one Assembly district and give the
extra Assemblyman left without a dis
trict in consequence to Placer alone, tak-*
ing Placer away from El Dorado. El Do
rado would then go with Alpine and Mono
and Amador and Calaveras would be to
gether.
Duryea' of ' Placer offered a ' resolution
directing that the Senate concur in the
amendments made in the Assembly. This
was lost after some debate' by a vote of
31 to 51. Then Shortridge offered. a reso
lution providing that it be the sense of
the caucus that the Tenth Assembly Dis
trict be composed of the counties of Pla
cer and El Dorado, the Eleventh Assem
bly District of Amador, Calaveras. Alpine
and Mono; the Fifty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict of San Benito, and the Fifty-ninth
Assembly District of Monterey. This was
adopted bv a viva voce vote and left the
bill as the Senate originally passed it,
with the exception of a few words in the
body of the bill put in by the Assembly
and adopted by the Senate.
There were twenty-nine Senators and
Fifty-three Assemblymen In the caucus.
The Senate acted on the bill at once, but
the Assembly adjourned without acting
upon It. in violation of the strict agree
ment of the caucus.
The caucus amendments to the bill were
given to Johnson to introduce in the As
sembly, he being chairman of the Com
mittee on Conference, which had. the bill
In hand. There was a roll call on the
question of adjournment and w Johnson's
was the vote which carried the motion to
adjourn. He eaid afterward that he had
not had a chance to Introduce the amend
ments as agreed upon by the caucus. It
must be done to-morrow or the Senate
will make trouble.
The apportionment bill was the measure
which it. was feared would hold the ses
sion over to next week. It will be passed
by the Assembly, receding from ita
amendments to-morrow.

MENTO. March 14.â The game bill, which
was the subject of much debate and a
great deal of feeling when It came up for
second reading, was read the third time
and passed this morning, despite vigorous
opposition and after several amendments
had been defeated.
The bill as passed Drohlblts the selling
of quail and deer, but cloes not stop hunt
ers from killing them. It wa3 argued that
this was an unjust discrimination in fa

who do not hunt but wfco enjoy a qua-1
now and then Just the came. An attempt
was therefore made to araond the bill to
cure this objection bv making the bill
operative upon all. This was provided for
In Leavitt's amendment to prohibit tho
killing of quail by any one for three years
In offering the amendment Leavitt said
he did so as a better measure of protection
to the quail than the bill as submitted. He
said if the bird needed protection at all It
was better to give it absolute protection
for a few year* than partial protection for
a good many. Â» The Senate was lined up,
however,, and Leavitt's amendment was
voted down. . ... ..
Taylor afterward got In ahead of the
amenders by moving the previous ques
tion. This was carried and then the bill
was passed by a vote of 23 to 6.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 14. â In a desperate effort
to hurry the Senate this afternoon tripped
itself up and lost one and a half of the
precious hours that still remain. Senator
Smith of Kern introduced an urgency res
olution providing that the tax levy bill
should be read three times on. the same
day and put upon Its passage.
Immediately Lukens tacked on another
bill, and before the resolution went
through It had three or four bills upon it.
Then another resolution was put in, and
immediately a dozen Senators were on
their feet with bills to add to it. It finally
went to a vote with nineteen bills upon
it, and It failed of the necessary twenty
seven votes. This was somewhat of a
facer for the unduly industrious, but they
went at another file and nearly had it
completed when the point of order was
raised that the Senate, having refused to
declare certain bills Â¦ matters of urgency,
those bills could therefore not be -put
upon the second resolution. As these
were tho bills every one wanted hurried,
they were all effectually shut out, and
the Senate went back to the regular or

framed by the Joint Elections Committee

Johnson led with the faint opposition
there was to concurrence In the Senate
amendments*. It was his amendment that
placed in the Assembly bill the other test
of a declaration of belief in the principles
of the party as embraced In the latest
platform. â¢ Ills was a forlorn hope to-day,
but Johnson has led nothing but forlora
hopes for the last two weeks of the ses
sion and he is getting used to it.
In the course of the debate Johnson as
serted that the political bosses of the
Senate were insisting? oa the test they harl
placed in the bill in order that thfÂ» act
would be declared unconstitutional. Sheri
dan said one test wÂ«is probably as good
as the other from a IcÂ»pal point of view
and the approach of adjournment made
concurrence advisable. Otherwise agree
ment would probably not be reached ani
the responsibility for failure to give tho

before this legislative session ends, so
that confirmation by the Senate will es
tablish the right of the appointee to hold
the office for a term of four years, but
the opinion prevails that the Governor
will wait until the present session ter
minates.
The Commissioner, if selected after ad
journment, may " not 'be permitted to
Eerve four years. Should the Governor on
the convening of the next Legislature
fancy that the right man had not been
selected he could send to the Senate the
name of another candidate. There Is talk
that Gage expects to succeed himself, and
is willing to wait a while to ascertain if
the appointee to succeed Major, Harney
shall develop into a good Harbor Com
mi^ioner.
However, the next Governor, whether
he be Gage or some one else, will be at
liberty wncn the next Legislature is con
vened* to nominate the man of his choice
for Hnrbor Commissioner. The question
is frequently asked, "Why does not the
Governor now s*end a name to the Senate
and make sure of a good Republican
Commissioner for the lull term of four
years?"
For a while ex-Surveyor General Wil
liam H. Brown had hopes of serving his
country on the water front, but his hopes
have vanished. There was talk along the
line of the push politicians that ex-Su
pervisor Kd Smith would get Major Har
tley's job, but the friends of Mr. Smith
are by no means sure that their man will
win out. Charles L. Patton, who made a
gallant race for Mayor of San Francisco
in isy&, was frequently mentioned as one
worthy of water front recognition, But
there has not been much X J atton talk
since the Legislature convened. Senator
Sig Bettman is on the list of candidates,
and is at least horioful.
Kx-SuporviEor Edward Algeltlnger Is a
candidate for service on the Harbor Com
mission, and it iiÂ« known that he is sup
ported by influential merchants.
Inasmuch as Paris Kllburn, president of
the Beard of Harbor Commissioners, is
from Monterey County, it is presumed
that the Governor will appoint a citizen
of San Francisco to succeed Major Har
ney. Â¦
John C. Lynch, Collector of Internal
Revenue, is "among those mentioned."
His tc-rm as a Federal office-holder will
soon expire, and as it seems to be settled
that Senators Bard and Perkins will not
rrcomrr.end him for a second term his
friends insist that Governor Gage will
appoint him Harbor Commissioner.
CharleB F". Curry is spoken of as one
likely to be chosen to look after harbor
affairs. Custom, honored alike in the
breach and observance. Imposes upon a
successful Harbor Commissioner the duty
of keeping the fences of the administra
tion in good repair. It is said that Secre
tary Curry's Ions experience In the field
of practical politics enables him to de
toct in a Fingle glance any weak place on
the line of political fences.
Rounders who have surveyed the field
on the outside and sought by every clever
stroke to pet at the true Inwardness of
the situation insist that the Governor has
a "dark horse," whose name has. not been
mentioned in the gossip. . Meanwhile Ma
jor Harney Is not pressing the Governor
to act immediately. The major's term of
four years will not expire until next
Thursday, and to accommodate the ex
ecutive he would doubtlees be willing to
serve a few months overtime.

The prosecution endeavored to place
Nora Schneider on the witness stand, but
counsel for the ex-convict strenuously
objected. He insisted that the young lady
was the wife of the prisoner and could
not give testimony against Jier husband.
Assistant District Attorney Whiting
argued that Cooper or Chadwlck was a
married man at the time he married Nora
Schneider on February 23 last and that
the burden of proof as to the defendant's
right tÂ« form a second marriage lay -with
the defense. Judge Fritz took the matter

the defendant and she cannot testify in
this case."

out of the door. The noise of the shots
attracted J. F. Lelter. who has a store

LONDON'. March H.-In the House of
Commons to-day th* leaders of the op
position searchingly criticised the Govern
ment's proposal for the increase and rc
fprm or the army. Sir Henry Campbell-
Banneraian eaid:
"The name and fajne of Lord Roberts
are a little too largely invoked in this
Question. Lord Roberts has spent nearly
the whole cf his military, life In India,
Â¦where he has had to deal with a finished
article, but he has had no- experience ot
the peculiar difficulties found in England
cf late in utilizing ajd furnishing raw
material."
Sir Henry declared that no Justification
had been offered by the Government for
increasing the aggressive military power
of Great Britain. Dwelling upon the dif
ficulty of getting rtcruits. he asserted
that the country wjuld not stand con
scription, and that the Government was
introducing a military system and spirit
which would fatally change the character
or the nation and empire.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt. who re
viewed the rapid Increase In the army
estimates during recent years, said noth
ing could be more hollow than the Idea
that great armaments were a security for
peace, adding that it was an easy matter
to make a war Inevitable. He reprobated
the proposal to have 123.000 men ready to
send abroad.
"Other countries r.eed great armies."
said Sir William, "because they have Ions
and vulnerable frontiers. England's po
sition is on the sea and it is the fleet
that must be made sufficient at whatever
cost."
Balfour, replying to the opposition lead
ers, pointed out that England's colonies
and dependencies v.ere contiguous to
great jwwprs which might be at war with
her and that her allies might reasonably
expect her assistance. The chief object
of the Government, he said, was not to
increase the number of troops, but to
make that number effective. The only
actual increase was the 10.009 garrison
veterans and the 25.000 yeomanry, an In
crease so Email as to afford no Justifica
tion for the charges brought against the
Government.'
Sir Charles Diike criticised the Govern
ment's scheme as ?nadequate. declaring
That he attached more importance to a
strike force equipped for going abroad
ih&n & horde of men at home.
The debate was thrn adjourned.

I "W., WASHINGTON, March 14.â The situ-
I atlon in China Is described by the officials
as resembling a tinder box. and a spark
generated by friction between the allies'
may set theVountry, if not almost the'
entire world, aflame.
As an illustration of the serious results
which may arise from minor causes at-,
tentlon was called to-day to the incidents
which followed the acquisition by Russia
of the settlement at Tientsin. This set
tlement is similar t-j that held by each
of the other nations. The Italian troop3
raised their flag over a portion of tho
settlement and Indicated their purpose to
remain. Fortunately Wojjack.
the Russian commander^ is a cool-headed
{ officer, and by diplomatic representation
he succeeded In securing the withdrawal
of the Italians.
If it be true, as'reported. that the Brit
ish commander In Tientsin has announced
that he proposes to .use force to compel
the evacuation of the settlement occupied
| by the Russians an armed conflict will
occur. The authorities hope that the
British Government will not support him
in any such action. ' *
Germany's Harsh. Terms.
In her proposal for settlement of the
Indemnity question Germany has agali>
shown her purpose to deal harshly with
China. Information ieceived here is to
the effect thafghe contemplates naming
a large sum for the Celestial Government
to pay and demanding that It be paid
without loss of time. .Russia, on the other
hand, has adopted ihe unselfish attitude
of the American Government. She has
heartily approved Secretary Hay's pro
posal that the Minsters in Peking de
termine upon a sum that China can pay
as the amount of indemnity to be de
manded ami to proportionately dis
tribute it among the powers. Great Brit
ain, of course, agrees with Germany.
Having a Just idea of the position of
China, Japan does not propose to join Â»n
any representation which- may result in
repudiation by China', .or precipitate dis
memberment and the American proposal
consequently meets with favor In Toklo.
Austria and Italy are creatures of Ger
many, so that they will support the pro
posal of the German 'Minister. Special
Commissioner RockMll is working ener
getically to obtain the assent of the pow
ers to the American proposal, but it is
anticipated that negotiations will drag
along for weeks bctcre a settlement of
this vexatious question is accomplished.
Suzerainty Over Manchuria,
Such Information as has come to the
hands of officials indicates that the Rus
sian agreement with China consists of
twelve articles. Th* chief concern of
officials here has Do?n to learn how far
these articles affect the permanent future
of Manchuria. On their face, it Is said,
they show a return of Manchuria to
China, which would seem to be quite in
jkeeping with the desire of all powers.
But this is accomplished â¢ upon certain
conditions imposed upon China and It is
understood that these conditions, in effect,
establish a Russian suzerainty ovÂ«r
Manchuria, with a Russian official oc
cupying the chief executive position, quite
similar to that of the. British Viceroy of
India. Comparing thb* condition with that
in India It is said that If the present
agreement is consummated ., Manchuria
iwifTbe much In tlttTTitrtte position as^inV'
*of the Indian states, having a certain de- [
Kree of Independence and yet 'conforming
all Its actions to il>e supreme authority
over it.

HEART DISEASE
Some Facts Segarding tha Rapid In-
crease of Heart Trouble.
Heart trouble, at Irast among the Amer-
icans, i* certainly Increasing, and while
this tasy be larptlj- due to the ficlteiaetit
and wÂ»jrry of American business life It is
mcTf > if ten the result of weak *toma.cns 4
or tn>nr < rjLTrttohr " "â^ ----:. i'^^r.^-^.^
Real orptnic disenfce Is Incurable; but
not one tcse in a. hundred o* heart trouble
js orranlc. - _ . ,
The p lose relation between heart trouble
end poor digestion Is because both organs
are controlled by the same irreat nerves,
â¢ the Sympathetic and Pneumofrastric.
In another way. also the heart Is affect-
f-6 by the form of poor digestion which
musts cap and fermentation from half
diprstrd food. There is a feeling of op-
I-retfJon and heaviness In the chest caused
by pressure of tile distended stomach on
the hf-art and lur.gs, interfering with their
cctior.; hor.ee arises palpitation and short
breath.
Poor digestion also â¢ poisons the blood,
rasklrir it thin and watery, which irritates
and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble is to Improve the digestion and to
insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regxilar use
after m^als of some safe, pleasant and ef-
fective digestive preparation, like Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, which may be found
at most drug- stores and which contain
valuable, harmless dipestive elements In a
pleasant, convenient form.
It Is safe to say that the regular per-
sistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
ax mealtime trill cure any form of stom-
ach trouble except cancer of the stomach
Full Elzed packag-e of these tablets sold
by druggists at 50 cents. Little book on

CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
BY F. R MTJLHOLLAND.
MORE than 2000 people -saw di
minutive My Gypsy, carrying J.
Ransch and eighty-five pounds
on her back, defeat the giant
Yellowtall for the Gunst handi
cap at Oakland track yesterday. It could
not be said the winner was best of the six
contestants for the prise, as. B. -Matthews'
injudicious handling of . Yellow Tail cost
that horse the race. After wiring the
management of OakHmd track for stalls,
the owners of Advance Guard and Tela
mon declared them out of the race, Tr.ey
were not missed and reither will owners
who resort to petty underhanded prac
tices ever be mis-sec! from the sport in this
State.
Betting on : the stake was keen and
sharp, both big and. small wagers pouring
into the bookmakers' tin "take boxes."
Tellowtail and Formero, each allotted 110
pounds and coupled as t the Hackett stable
entry, closed a slight favorite over Beau
Ormonde, the Litter -with Dominick up. In
wnrming up Yellowtall tried to run away
with his rider, and this exhibition earned
for him additional friends. The eighty-five
pounfler, My Gypsy, had fives quoted
about her, and Florizar tickets at 4 to 1
were peddled out profusely. Goldone
had the outside call; Called to the post,
Jake I-foItxnan pent tho horses away per
fectly aligned/ after- only a slight delay,
caused. by the unruly actions of Yellow
tail. Unfortunately Beau Ormonde drew
the inside position, and trudged along in
the deep going for a quarter of a. mile,
when he fell back. Matthews, taking the
lead with Yellowtail, .had the big chest
nut under restraint to the stretch. Head
ed for the wire. Matthews, instead of
picking the best footing, clung to the rail,
where It was cuppy and slow. Opposite
the paddock this handicap began to tell,
and Matthews drew his whip. It was no
help, for Ransch, on My Gypsy, ran him
down, and In a fierce drive, Â¦won by a
neck. Florizar closed well, Just losing the
show to Formero. . . Â¦
Favorites decamped with three events.
Dominick again rode in superb form, pi
loting four winners.
After the indifferent showing made b/
Killdoe, favorite for the opening four fur
long scramble, the Foulshot youngster's
victory pver Dr. Scharff some days ago
must be put down as a fluke. Zlrl. with
a whirlwind gwet of epeed, led from the
jump, winning easily by three lengths.
Ruiz brought Jarretiet re d'Or up in time
to collar arid beat Killdoe for the place.
The winner, second choice in the betting,
was ridden by Dominick.
Mike Strauss demonsirateJ the fact that
he is a sprinter with tome pretensions to
class by beating- Miss Rowcna and a
bun^h of fast ones in the Futurity course
sprint following. Before a furlong had
been reoled off Dominick had Mike in
front and, gradually drawing away, scored
easily at the close by a couple of lengths.
Alleviate outgamed Midlove. taking the
place. There was . no uronouneed choice
in the betting, 4 to 1 being obtainable
against lany of the starters at one stage
or another of the speculating.
After this came the very handy win of
The- Ligh.t. with Monnce in the saddle.
The books at first laid 4 to 5 against tie
chances of the fast marc winning the- six
furlong Fprint, which was quickly cut to
1 to 2. With his customary alertness at
the j>ost Dominick had Duckoy away" ln
front and, though- -tr-.p gelding made an
excellent showing, was outpointed .and
outclassed, falling short two lengths at
the wire. Tame Irishman ran into the
show. \ â¢ Â¦ -_
Atkin & Lottridge'B useful two-year-clo
Glendenning made it. four , straight bv
capturing the second kindergarten number
with Dominick up. One to two was the
closing quotation and tl?e son of St. Carlo
finished an, easy first.. Constable stood
a h.ird driv#. leading out Maraschino for
the place. Victoria S had a world of speed,
but stopped to nothlh!?r
Bookmaker Fred Cook's erratic sprinter
St. "Wood i* becoming quite consistent of
late. Closing an 8 to 5 choice for the final
event, he won all the way, downing Crom
well, a 20 to 1 shot, two lengths. Gibraltar
sulked from, start to finish.
AT TANFORAN TRACK
BY LOUIS HONIO.
ONE .dollar parleyed on the six win
ners at .Tanforan yesterday at pre
vailing odds would have fabulous
ly outgrown itself in labyrinthine,
multiplicity. Something like $750.
000 would have been Its accretionary value
if the winnings of each race -could have
been placed and allowed to accumulate.
Such was the deluge that fell upon th?j
favorites, sending them to everlasting
reckoning without the showing of a first
money, except in the single Instance of
the fourth race, which Theory annexed
at odds of 5 .to 2. On the faces of the
bookmakers was engraved the quiet,
thankful spirit that Is born of gratitude.
The public said harsh things, but that is
nothing new and hardly a ripple was
stirred in the ring atmosphere.
Tizona at 8 <o 1 introduced this .long
shot festival. Then came Sinn at 7* to 1,
after which was Tuthill, 8 to 5; Theory,
Â» to 2; Immodell 30 to 1. and last of nil
Tom Sharkey at 30 to 1. Just a single dol
lar to start with, six shafts of luck shot
Into you.In succession, more acceptances
by the bookies than they would or could
give and something like three-fourths of
a million dollars would be waiting, for a
place In your private safe. The figures
Beem declaratory of falsehood, on their
face, but add it up and lind out for your
p*lf. Seven hundred and fifty, thousand
dollars for one. -What a. pleasant dream!
"Fifteen minutes for a new book" was
.shouteiin the ring before.the third race
yesterday. Originally Tuthill was posted
with the name of Thorpe on top. That
was an error, as Thorpe had not been en
gaged, but Burns, who afterward rode
the horse to victory. When tho change
was announced Johnny ColemanÂ» who
"cut in" yesterday, made a short cut him
self to the judges' ptand, heavy with a
request to call all-bets off. The Judges
listened aiid decreed. Tuthill with Thorpe
un,sold at 2 to 1; with Burns at 6 to 5.
The race was, triangular, over the-milo
. route --and was without Interest. Soon
after the start Burns went out in the lead,
O'Connor taking second place wlrti' Star
Chamber and Henry oh Gonfalon snuffling
the wake. So the race 'began and so it
endod-. Tuthill covered the distance in
1:33%, fast time for Tanforan.
. In the first race Tizona covered the six
Jurlongs ahead of the pack. At the finish
and Foul Play shot out from a
bad mix-up and secured place and show.
'â¢After.a bad start SInll with Murphy on
lop woii' by a bare ' neck from Princess
Titartla. To many on the other side'of
the. wire it looked as If the Princess had
reached home for the first dab rj. the
money.- . ...
Theory beat a field of eight ln tho fourth
Tace. â¢ Henry waited iri a position that was
-*afe for a sprint when the time came, and
the* time came in the stretch. Theory
proved himself a gperd one, but Dangerous
Maid piloted by O'Connor drove Henry to
the bat- sometime.' before the stand waa
reached. . Maid took place, money and Sly
fought the game for show.
Immodell was the great surprise of the
fifth race. O'Connor on Aphrodis-seemed
to have a good hold on the race until Im
modell spurted and won out. Luccra got
tho show. . .
The last race for qualified jumpers en
the. flat was, won by the belated Tom
Sharkey. whose arrival ' was so many
times, delayed. â¢ Olinthus, the favorite,
showed no speed at all. May Boy, 40 to
1, and Sharkey fought it out in tho
stretch for first' honors, when the sailor
put the whin! of summer " into second
money.

There will be two celebrations of the
Jubilee. The celebration which takes
place next Monday and Tuesday will be
followed by a threo days" jubilee in the
first week of June. A3 the fiftieth anni
versary of the founding of Santa Clara

Montgomery of Los Angeles will preach.
Archbishop Riordan of this city will offi
ciate on Tuesday. In addition to the
religious ceremonies there will be several
orations and field day athletics by tho

ing the present buildings and erect a
larger edifice. If the '.ana is secured, the
foundation stone of the new Santa Clara
College will be laid during the June celt
bration. The first day of that celebration
will be marked by the commencement ex
ercises. In addition, a new sacred drama

left undone that mlshi contribute toward
properly commemorating the fiftieth an
niversary of the founding of the college.

Some of the surplus will be devoted to
repairing the plumbing in several school
houses, which are sadly In need of sani
tary improvement. Auditor Wells holds
that the money may be legally used for
such repairs, and tho work of repairing
will be vigorously prosecuted during the
coming vacation week.
It vi as stated that the surplus will be
Increased over the figure named by sev
eral thousand dollars at the end of the
fiscal year. If the Increase permits an
other six-room schoolhouse will be built
probably In the district south of the park.
President Kincald says that the expendi
ture would be warranted because hun
dreds of dollars are expended yearly in
the districts named for the rental of out
side rooms, and this would be saved.
Auditor Wells informed the. board that
he would not oppose the use of the money
for that purpose, as he was of the opinion,
that the only way to build schoolhouses
was for the board itself to take the mat
ter in hand. The board then decided to
go ahead with its Intention to build the
proposed schoolhouse.
School Directors Kincald, Mark, Cas
serly and Denman visited Auditor Wells
yesterday for the purpose of ascertaining
if there is any legal obstacle to using at
least a portion of this surplus to build
the new schoolhouse. President Klncaid
stated that the Board of Kducation was
anxious to carry out the plan, as it was
felt that the Supreme Court decision on
the bond question would be long delayed.
Mrs. Kincald said that It had been
learned that a good schoolhouse of six or
eight rooms could be built for about $6000.
The Board of Education has been con
sidering, the advisability of building a
new schoolhouse out of its surplus fund
and has decided that as soon as Its plans
are matured the Richmond district will
be provided with an eight-room school to
accommodate the growing population. At
present the surplus to the credit of the
School Department fund amounts to $12,
356 27. Of this amount $G000 was carried
over from the last fiscal year.
Board of Education Decide3
to Use Surplus Fund for
This Purpose.

Steamer Movements.
pÂ«-^Â«iHE echooner Llllebonn* has been
I chartered to take a load of lum-
J bÂ«r to Tonga. Thla 1Â» probably
Jl one of the first vessels that ha3
ever cleared from thla coast for
that far-away Isle In the Southern seas.
The LJi:ebonr.e arrived her* from San
Marcos Island a week ago with a cargo
cf gypsum. She was chartered prior to
arrival by Williams, Dlicond & Co. to load
lumber at Grays Harbcr for Toaga.
The island of Tonga is ruled by a na
tive King under a British protectorate.
Hitherto ail the merchandise require.'
there has g-one from Auckland, K. Z.. or
Sydney. N. S. W. Kauri lumber that goes
from Auckland is very expensive and does
rot Etar.d the climate as well as Oregon
pir.e. The Klnp of Toapa has recently
taken unto himself a wife and an addition
al wing is to be added to the palace. His
Majesty has heard the praises of Pacific;
Coast lumber sung many a time and the
Lillebor.ne's cargo Is for the King. For a
return load the schooner will bring back
copra and pearl shell.
Captain Hansen and his schooner are
likely to remain some time In Tongan
waters, a* at the present time there are
only :he working days In the island. Sev
eral generations ago the missionaries
rrade a mistake In the days of the week
Â«wl Saturday was considered "'the day
of rest." Latterly the Government, backed
by the British resident agent, has changed
the Sunday to the first day of the week
against the wish of the natives. In con
feiuer.ee the natives pray on Saturday
cr.d work on Sundav. while the Govern
ment offices, including the Custom-house,
ere open on Saturday and closed on Sun
day.
SAILOBS ABE STILL SCARCE.
Ships cf the Grain Fleet Cannot Se-
cure Men.
Deep water sailors are hard to get and
the big ship Dltton has been tied up for a
week for want of men. The DuchaJburn
came down from Port Costa yesterday,
but there Is no telling when she will get
away.
After being tied up for nearly a fort
night the A.uldglrth und Arranmore *rol
away Wednesday. Captain Howes of the
Arranmore had sufficiently recovered
from his illness to be able to take his Ehlo
out. The Marguerita Doilfus and the
Hougamor.t are loading a.nd will be down
next week, while the Merioneth and Har
blrger are going to The grain elevators In
a day or two. This will about exhaust the
fleet.
The British fhip Eulomene will have
pome fun aboard when she gets here.
She Is now at Victoria. B. C. but as there
Is no chance for a grain charter on the
Sound, she is coming- here to load wheat
"on owners' account" at Balfour's. The
bcarriing-houFe runners will use every
means in their power to induce the crew
to leave the vessel, and. as the captain
knows the state of the labor market, it
will be a case of diamond cut diamond.
Lost Her Propeller.
The steam schooner Robert Dollar Is
on her way hero In tow of the steam coll
ier Matteawan. On Tuesday laÂ«t the
Dollar started from Seattle for San Fran
cisco. When riphteen miles south of Cape
Flattery she Ftruck a floating pile or some
thing' else and h^r propeller was carried
away. The steamer was soon pot under
all sail and headed back for the Sound.
When Ne-ih Bay was reached the anchors
Â¦were Jet ko. and the captain went ashore
to telephone for assistance. The Matte
awan. with COM tons of coal aboard, was
bound out. and the captain apreed to tow
the Robert Dollar to San Francisco.
Steamship Australia Late.
The Oo*Â»ar.lc Stpami-hlp Company's Aus
trsMa Is atray behind her schedule time,
and the a^ntp are beginning to think she
ha? been detailed at Papeete. Had any
thinj? happened to the mall boat the news
would probably have bÂ»en cabled from
Awk'.nr.d or Sydney, as two lines of
6t*>am'-rs from thoce ports make Tahiti a
calline pla<-e. Then agnln something may
have hapjiened to her machinery and. like
the City of Pokinjr. when she lost her
propeller, the Australia may be coming 1
alone under pall. Captain Lawless has
tried the Australia under sail several
tlrrK-s. and on each occasion Fhe averaped
aMit four knots an hour. The run bÂ«
tww>n Tahiti a::d San Francisco Is the
moPt peaceful on the Pacific Ocean. The

The bay schooner Berwick met with a
peculiar accident yesterday. She had dis
charged her cargo into the bark Kalulanl
and was being towed away from Folsom
street by the tug Amelia when the trou
ble came. Tho flood tide was running
about four miles an hour, and when the
Berwick cleared the wharf it caught and
carried her away from the Amelia down
on the _ stem or the Government tug Slo
cum. The schooner was struck amidships
and nearly cut to the water's edge. She
swung clear and then the Amelia got hold
or her again and ran her down to the mud
fiats.

Harrison-street wharf to-day. She will

By a recent vote of the Commons the coronation
oath of King Edward will be so changed from the
oath of former sovereigns as to contain nothing offen
sive to the Roman Catholics of his empire. The
clause requiring the King to expressly repudiate the
doctrine of transubstantiation and to declare the invo
cation and adoration cf the Virgin and the saints to
be idolatrous was embodied in the coronation oath
in 1G88 and has been retained until this time. The
new King will have to swear to nothing that signifies
any kind of religious intolerance.
An item going the rounds of the Eastern press is
to the effect that if Minister Conger, now at Peking,
wishes the Republican nomination for Governor of
Iowa he can get it. The report goes on to say he
is heavily in debt by reason of bad speculations, but
*'his creditors expect that he will obtain a personal
indemnity from the Chinese Government sufficient
to clear the flate." Here then is a new way to pay
old deb*s, and doubtless many a speculative politician
will make a note of it.
TROUBLE IN THE BALKANS.
pZJ OR a long time the people of the Balkan States
I ; had a monopoly of the European war cloud.
Public attention was incessantly fixed upon Bul
garia, Servia, Macedonia, Albania and Turkey. There
was always a sign of war in that part of the world,
and speculation used to vary in calculating the time
when the cloud would burst. Some authorities said
six months, some said six weeks, and some said it
might occur any day.
The outbreak of our war with Spain distracted at
tention from the Balkans, and as the war in South
Africa followed and the Chinese imbroglio came soon
after, comparatively little has been thought or said of
them for about three years. Now, however, they are
making a new bid for public notice. * Weary of in
action they "have once more filled their skies with
clamors and made the welkin ring with shouts that
give promise of battle.
For some time pa.it the Macedonians have had
trouble with the Turks. They complain of Turkish
outrages and the Turks answer by complaints of
Macedonian outrages. It appears there is a strong
secret society having its headquarters in Bulgaria
which is incessantly working for trouble in Mace
donia. Recently the Turkish Government threatened
to line the Bulgarian frontier with troops and make
short work of any one found intriguing in the inte-est
of the conspirators. Another report is to the effect
that the Bulgarian Ministry is strongly Russian in
sympathy and is fomenting trouble in Macedonia as
a part of a Russian programme.
At this distance it is not easy to determine the rela
tive rights and wrongs of the controversy. In fact
the disturbance is primarily due to the artificial man
ner in which the states of the Balkan peninsula are
organized. The people of all of them are dissatisfied
with the existing condition of things, and so long as
that discontent continues there will never be lacking
cause for strife. The whole of that portion of Europe
is in a condition of instable equilibrium and very little
in the way of impulse is required to' set it rocking to
and fro as if, about to fall to pieces.
It has been announced that for the purpose of pre
paring to meet the new emergency "the Macedonian
Committee has summoned an extraordinary Congress
to meet March 31 to consider the complications." Just
what -that may mean is. not clear; but some light is
thrown upon it by the further announcement in the
dispatch: "It is known that large quantities of arms
and ammunition have been secretly imported into thi
vilayets ot Kossovo, Uskuv and Monastier. ' Two
Russian officers, who have recently toured in North
ern Macedonia incognito, left last evening for St.
Petersburg. The Bulgarian Government has received
sharp reminders from three of the great powers that
it will be held responsible for the preservation of order
in the border districts. Great anxiety exists in Al
bania, which is in a state of unusual ferment."
Since Russia has so much on her hands in the build
ing of the Siberian railroad and in the advancement
IRRIGATION.
THE National Irrigation Congress meets . this
year at Colorado Springs.
It will discuss the progress of irrigation and
the condition of laws upon that subject, individual and
interstate water rights and the whole body of legal
and physical problems involved in the conservation of
water and its equitable distribution and economic use.
The appeal to Congress for appropriations to irri
gate the West failed, and its failure was avenged by
Carter in talking the river and harbor bill to death.
. We are not clear that a Federal appropriation for
that purpose will ever succeed on its merits. Federal
appropriations are now only three hundred millions
short of one billion per session. The taxpayers , are
going to soon become impatient with the invention
of new objects of expenditure. Our pride is satisfied
because we have the greatest government on earth,
but our pockets are sore because it is the costliest
also. If there be any way tp utilize existing public
resources for irrigation without resorting to taxation
it should be considered. The people of the "West
should be wise in their day and generation. They
should examine their own resources and if possible
derive therefrom the means for their development.
The proposition to lease the arid ranges to stock
men and devote the' proceeds to irrigation in the
States and Territories where it is derived is so reason
able and so feasible that it excites the contempt of
those who think a crooked line is shorter between
fixed points than a straight one. A reasonable esti
mate puts the rental of the arid ranges at $9,000,000
a year. We believe that Senator Carter "beefed" be
cause Congress denied $250,000. for irrigation. If, in
stead of leather lunging the Senate, he had consulted
in his own State men like McCormick and John M.
Holt, they could have shown him how to get thirty
six times as much money for irrigation without asking
a dollar from the treasury or getting an attack o!
laryngitis by a thirteen-hour speech.

Lowestoft The ware of Lowestoft is a
coarse-grained bluish-white. The decora
tion Is often of little stemless flowers In
natural colors or chocolate or brown; of
shields, coats of arms, monograms or
initials, frequently in brown and gold.
A border of blue, diversified with gold
stars, or a meander pattern of gold, la
seen, especially on punchbowls. Th? cups
of Lowestoft are usually small and with
out handles; .the mugs are both cylin
drical and barrel-shaped. The coffee pots
are tall, with straight spouts; the han
dles of the teapots are crossed or twisted
and attached to the body with leaves.
The surface glaze of the large pieces is
often somewhat rough, as if painted Into
shape by hand. There are no marks or
Btampa on this ware. The ships of New
England merchants in the India trade
brought vast quantities of this Lowes
toft to America in the years between 1800
and 1830, and nearly every old family of
dignity from Maine to Georgia had a
Lowestoft service which was called India
china. Hence specimens are not rare, but
are much beloved by their owners.
Willow-pattern ware was seen every
where. This willowware was made in
England from a design copied from the
Chinese, and It was made in China from
the English ware. A table set with wil
lowware had much charm both in appear
ance and In the Imaginary story con
neqted with it, which was a favorite with
children. A sprightly woman wrote a
poem to the willowware, beginning thus:
I have never been to China, and I fear I never
can
Be chosen as ambassadress to Peking or
Chusan,
Hut I know the kind of place it Is as well as
older pates
From different works ! on China illustrated by
our plates.
The color of the country is a. kind of dingy
blue.
With chaotic land and water here and there
j appearing: through.
Interspersed with funny bridges and paths that
eeem to glide
To very funny houses upon the other ilde.
There are frightful flowers growing upside
down and Inside out.
Trees with caterpillars laden, iomÂ« with roots
and eome without.
These set designs were followed by blue
and wnue ware of clouded outline known
as "flowing blue," which Is valueless save
for Its color.
Tea Drinking a Century Ago.
Silver spoons were seen on all tables of
well-to-do people In 1S01. Alchemy and
powter SDOons were out of date. There
were a few three-tined forks; two tines
were far more common. Knives were of
steel, sharpened for use. with handles of
shagreen, horn, ivory or wood. Table
cloths and napkins were of homespun lin
en, ample in number and firm in quality.
A fashion prevailed of spreading a white
damask tablecloth over one of figured
colored damask. When the last glass of
wine was reached and the almonds and
raisins and fruit, the white cloth was
taken off, leaving what was called a des
sert cloth. If tea was served it was in
handleless cups, hard of hold if the bever
age was hot. The tea was poured into
a saucer and drunk therefrom. Daniel
Webster always drank his tea from a
saucer. The teacup wast set in a little
plate known as a cup plate. Prince de
Broglie discovered after drinking his
twelfth cud of tea that if he wished no
more he must place his spoon across his
cup. Until he did that his hostess kept
pressing fresh tea upon him. A tea urn
was a pretty table appointment with tea
ana sugar canisters, cream pots and su
gar tongs.
George Washington's Invention.
Wine was served in handsome glass de
canters, which were set in silver-rimmed
coasters with wooden bases. These coast
ers were sometimes double, made to hold
two decanters or bottles, and were set on
four little wheels like a miniature wapon.
They were dragged around the surface of
the table by a little tongue or handle. It
is a matter of tradition that these double
coasters on wheels were Invented by
George Washlngrton, and that the word
coaster thus used is also American.
table was often set with the dessert in
groups of pretty glasses and dishes, and
it deserved display, for the whips, sylla
bubs, trifles, quaking custards, creams
and floating islands were the skilled labor
of many hours, usually of the house mis
tress and her daughters:
There was another reason for the con
venience, of a narrow ,,tableâ there .was lit
tle waiting upon or serving airoeals, save
by the persons seated at the table. Men
of great wealthâ the great land owners
in the South and ship owners in the North
âhad butlers and waiters, usually ne
groes, often clumsy and Ill-trained; but
folk of ample means and bountiful table
helped one another at meals. Servants
placed the food upon the table, and some
times tho "help" then sat down at the
end of the long table. The host always
carved, placing his cuts one by one on the
pile of plates In front of him, which were
In turn passed down the table and sup
plied by each person with the vegetable
or sauce from the dish in front of him
until -all were served bountifully with all
on the table.
Wooden Trenchers and Pewter Plates.
Wooden trays and trenchers, ever the
cheap, cleanly and convenient table fur
nishing of pioneers, had disappeared with
the eighteenth century, before the domin
ation of pewter, save in rare instances,
as during the Revolution, when pewter
was melted into bullets, or during the
embargo in the nineteenth century, when
London pewter came little to American
ports. Then "trencher bees" were held,
where the young men made trenchers
from poplar wood and the young women
scraped them smooth with glass.
Pewter, too, was being thrust out. Con
servative folk like John Hancock hated
the clatter of china and clung to pewter.
It was thought that china dulled. the
edges of knives. The round platter, or
"charger," was used for serving boiled
meats long after pewter plates had dis
appeared. A "garnish or pewter" still
was a bridal gift in the country in 1801,
though china was used everywhere in the
city.
Sefore tho Revolution there began to be
imported to America from England many
pieces of a close-grained, creamy, opaque
ware, which was not china and seemed
smoother pottery, which was known as
"yellow ware" or Liverpool ware, and
nearly all of It was decorated in Liver
pool In black or red prints by a process
of transfer printing or pottery engraving
invented by one Sadler, a Liverpool en
graver. He had the notion of china print
ing suggested to him by seeing children
when at play in a doll's house decorate
their broken pieces of crockery by past
ing on .scraps of engravings which he had,
thrown aside. This yellow ware was very
highly prized for many years, and.
wealthy merchants and sea captains
brought pieces home as gifts. We find,
therefore, that many of the large pieces
of yellow ware found in America, such as
pitchers and mugs, are printed .with views
of ships and sailors, Masonic designs and
patriotic views relating to America. ;"
These pitchers are what are known as
the watermelon shape, and often hold
two or three gallons, whether they were
made in Liverpool or not, they were dec
orated there, as Sadler kept his process
a Becret, and Liverpool ware is their
name. They are much sought after by
collectors, and are usually about a cen
tury old. I have found but one that had
the Liverpool stamp on the base.
Tableware and Their Designs.
Other cream-colored ware were seen on
the table of 1801, chiefly the queensware,
whicn was made at Leeds. It is yellow
ish and was imported in some quantity
after the Revolutionary war: also a pure
white ware made at Leeds. Both are
found in basket or openwork wicker de
signs. Often these pieces are unmarked.
Some are marked "Leeds pottery" or "C.
G." (for Charles Green, one of the owners
of the pottery), also a "G" under a crown
and sometimes an arrowhead.
The Castleford wares came to this coun
try in considerable numbers, especially a
fine white ware, with surface divided into
compartments by raised lines Â¦which were
colored green or blue. In these compart
ments are sometimes medallions of liberty,
the spread-eagle or other devices relating
to America.- These are usually unmarked.
Very rarely old pieces of salt-glaze ware
came here. These have a granulated sur
face something like orange peel. They
â¢were usually of pure "cream color, in
raised designs, standing on feet usually
designed like lions' heads. They were
cast i in molds < resembling the molds for
silverware. Sometimes the relief borders
were colored green or yellow. These aro
sometimes called Crouchware and were
imported more frequently to the Southern
States than to the Northern. .
Pieces of "black china," especially tea
pots, are often seen In old country homes.
The oldest are a 'kind, of red "pottery cov
ered with a black glaze. They look, al
most like black glass. They often have a
raised â¢ design and sometimes have cay
colored flowers painted over this black,
Klassy surface. They are called In Kn*
land â¢ "black decanter" and were made In
Jackfleld as early/ aa 1713. and In one or
two other ootterles.r "
BEREFT DELAWARE.
T OR the first time in the history of the Union a
State is left without any representation in the
1 Senate.
Addicks has made coed his threat, "Addicks or no
Senator.'' The State of Delaware is bereft of repre
sentation, but perhaps is just as well off as she wouVi
be with John Addicks sitting in one of her Senatorial
teats.
He is a very rich man who moved from Philadelphia
into Delaware with the avowed purpose of getting a
Senatorship. He has deadlocked two Legislatures,
but except his money has exhibited no merit that
has commended him to the State. By pursuing his
personal and selfish ambition he has deprived Deiu
ware of two Senators, and the Republican party of
two voles.
It would seem that his mere membership of the
party is damage enough to its good name, without
inflicting upon it deprivation of the strength to which
it is entitled in the Senate.
The continuing deadlock in Nebraska also involves
two feats in the Senate, and it will be a sorry com
mentary upon the loyalty and public spirit of the
Republicans of that State if personal ambition shall
bear the same fruits there as in Delaware. If 'it do,
iÂ« will have a strong influence in sending the State
back to Bryan and Populism, a slough of despond
fiom which it was believed to have happily escaped
Four votes in the Senate may be very important to
the administration and the party, as well as to the
country, and the men who put their selfish interests
above all other considerations will not soon cease to
feel the righteous wrath of those they have betrayed.
The dining table used a century ago
was much narrower than that of the pres
ent day. It was a survival of the "tablet
board", of the early colonists, which was
simply a long, narrow, detached board
top laid on trestles shaped somewhat like
a fiawhorse. The tablecloth was then
called a "boardcloth." This narrow table
top was ample for the table furnishings
of the day. Our grandmothers did not
need the five feet of diameter which wÂ©
now crverload â¢ with a motley display of
linen, lace, silver, crystal, flowers and
confections. They had no flowers on the
table, and but rarely an epergne. or dish
with fruit. . There were no "individual"
pieces, save plates, knives, forks and usu
ally but not always glasses. Sometimes
a tankard circulated round the table.
There was always a' salt cellar, one of
goodly size; and by 1820 there was a cas
tor, which had been &een before that date,
but was not universally used. Benjamin
Franklin had cruet stands and castors. A
book of directions for fashionable dinner
giving, not yet fifty years old, begins the
chapter on table furnishing thus: "Be
sure to set the castor exactly in the mid
dle of the table."
At a formal tea party or dinner the
Such pieces are always old, and are
much sought after by collectors ana are
often found tipped with silver and with
silver lids. The other so-called "black
china" Is unglazed and dull of surface
and was made by many of the Stafford
shire potters. It was named by >v edg
wood, as ho perfected it, "black ba
saltes." Some of the finer pieces have
sliding lids or lids hinged on metal pins.
Pieces Imported From China.
A sudden and vast commerce sprung up
between America and China and was well
under way by 1S01. so that great quanti
ties of Oriental ware came to our ports.
The Chinese pieces found in greatest
quantity are old Canton and what Is
known to collectors as Lowestoft. The
Canton pieces are a thick and rather
clumsy warÂ© of greenish or bluish white
ground, with blue figures of Oriental pat
tern. The marks or stamps on the under
side of the pieces are generally Chinese
letters or signs in bluo, of various mean-
Ings. The Oriental pieces known as
Lowestof t are so called from an errone
ous Impression which has been promul
gated to a moat remarkable extent that
these pieces were made or decorated in
Lowestof t, England. I have never seen a
piece that I believed, to be made In
TRACK GAMBLING SCHEMES.
WE are not^the only community in the Union
that is being subjected to the schemes of race
. track gambler^;. There has j recently been in
troduced into; the 'Pennsylvania; Legislature a bill
which the Philadelphia Public Ledger says "while
professedly for the purpose of regulating horse racing
and improving the breed of, horses is nothing more
than an attempt to legalize and encourage poolselling,
gambling and debauchery." â¢
The scheme which has been put forward in Pennsyl
vania is; so- much like ; that "which has been' worked
upon the people of San Francisco that it is worth not
ing as an< illustration of. how. thoroughly in harmony
the track gamblers aVc. The bill, which is entitled an
act to regulate horse racing, and to establish a State
Racing Commission, begins by declaring: â¢ "The
breeding of valuable horses is a matter of public con
cern, and is best promoted __by regulating the times
and places, when and where, and the circumstances
under which, horse racing can.be legally held." That
much is said to hoodwink the public. The substance
of the bill is to" be found in a clause to this effect:
"It' shall be. unlawful for any- person or persons to
make or sell pools or to make a book or to bet upon
the result of any race except within the grounds of
any corporation or association licensed as hereinbe
fore provided."
Commenting upon the-bill and the proposed Racing
Commission the Public Ledger says: "The Commis
sioners are to serve without compensation, but it re
quires no wizard to foresee that the post of Racing
Commissioner is likely/to .become more lucrative than
the Governorship. The Commissioners, in the first
place, decide who shall have licenses to conduct gam
bling race meets; they, lay down the rules under which
the racing is to be carried on, and the licenses have to
be renewed yearly. In the exercise of their autocratic
power they. will, dealwith gamblers, -crooks,, and, in
a word, with the riff-raff of the community, who in
clude in their ranks s?mi-criminals and those who are
strongly predisposed to blackmailing and corruption.
We said that the bill was designed to legalize and
encourage gambling. â¢ In fact, it appears to be an ac:
that will encourage the levying of blackmail, and the
Legislature, if it passes the bill, will create a commis
sion and a condition that will prove a great scandal."
The vigor with which the scheme has been de
nounced by the press el Pennsylvania is instructive to
us because it proves that the evil of track gambling
is as welLunderstood there as here. It is, in fact, in
herent in the very practice of gambling and does not
depend upon location or circumstances. As the Pub
lic Ledger puts it those who regulate gambling at
race tracks "deal with gamblers," crooks, and, in a
word, the riff-raff of the community, who include in
their ranks semi-criminals and those who are strongly
predisposed to blackmailing and corruption." - Â¦
That is the sort of crowd that is to be brought to
San Francisco by the reopening of Ingleside. Tht
author of the track gambling ordinance in this city,
who announced his responsibility for it, will not be
envied when the full significance of his responsibility
becomes demonstrated by results that are sure to
follow.

Written by many members of the Fran

1 7 ASHINGTON CITY, has of late become noteil
\Aj .for something more than 'Congress. Visitors
.' to the place no longer, look upo.n it asa.mcr:
hotel and boarding-house. annex to the Capitol. It
lias become a city and is being criticised; as such, but
the criticisms are not altogether favorable. :
Upon the occasion of the inauguration of President
McKinlcy last week many thousands of people-went
to Washington to see the sights and share in the pub
lic rejoicings upon the beginning of a second terra
of four years of prosperity. Most of them appear to
have been jarred by their reception; for. since their
return home our Eastern exchanges have been marked
by, the number of communications protesting against
Washington manners and Washington extortion.
The extortion is what seems to have "hit them hard-'
cst." One of them, writing' to the New York Sun.
says:
The national capital may not be up with New York as
a commercial center, hut in hotel enterprise I think a
glance at the following list of prices for two persons for
two days of tlie-Inausuration ceremonies may i>e instruc
tive. One room at the Rises House for two people must
be taken for a week, charges $175; at the Shoreham for
one week, $20 a day: the Metropolitan, $50 to $75 for /four
days; the Ebbitt, flO a day for one week; at t,he Wlllard,
five days, J10 a day.
Such charges are evidence that Washington City .
understands that the country is prosperous and that
the people have money to burn. It is clear, however,
that if those prices are to prevail it will\be cheaper
for the republic to hold inauguration ceremonies in
San Francisco, since patriots from the remotest East
could come here, spend a week and get back home
for less than is required to pay a hotel bill for two
days at Washington. Several authorities" estimate that
there were expended for the inauguration parades and
festivities upward of $4,000,000. There are doubtless
many cities in the Union that would undertake the
show for half the money. â¢
'The manners of Washington appear to have struck'
the visitors in much the same way as the hotel prices.
It is said the manners arc very high and have a foreign
flavor. One writer who seems to have made a- deep .
stud}' of the subject says there has centered in Wash
ington a large number of wealthy people of leisure
who, having never acquired at home any. settled social,
convictions or any formal code of etiquette, have in
their new location adopteu the manners, modes and
precedents of the foreign Embassadors and Ministers.
Thus the society of the capital has a manner which
irritates the visitor whether from Maine or from Kan
sas, and he feels that he is not at home even when he
can slap his Senator on the back and call him "old
hoss."
This student of Washington society says:
The American "smart set," who have to a o>gree
taken possession of Washington, "dearly love a lord."
Their functions must noÂ»- open with the presence of the
Right Honorable Lord Pauncefote and family, and there
after pursue a gilded course down through a series of en
tertajnments whereat the foreign embassies provide the
most cherished guests. The President of the United
States and his Cabinet and those concerned In the legisla
tive branches of the Government of the greatest nation
In the world are but lightly regarded in comparison. They
have and can have no established and lasting social state
after the European models, because republicanism means
change and unsettlement, equality of opportunity and no
monopoly of privilege. Here officialdom is a shifting and
unsatisfactory Quantity. Officers of the navy and army
come neaVer to meeting this demand of "society," and so
are more hjghly regarded.
Such arc the echoes that roll around the land after
the uproar of the inauguration. There is nothing in
all of these statements which need annoy Washington.
In a country so big as this there is room for all kinds
of cities and all sorts of folks. Since Chicago does
kowtow to a pork packer, New York to a stockbroker,
Philadelphia to a sleepwalker and Boston to a lyceum
lecturer, there is no reason why Washington should
not go into raptures over a man who attends repub
lican levees in a court dress. It is only in San Fran

CLOVERPORT, Ky., "March HâThÂ©
bursting: of a natural gas pipe at midnight
started a tire that destroyed property
worth half a million dollars. The greater
part of this little town was completely
wiped out and over a thousand persons,
about one-half the population, are home
less and were in great distress until a
special relief train from Louisville reached
here. The heaviest loser la the American
Tobacco Company, which lost two large
stemmeries and 1,000,000 pounds of tobac
co. The company's loss has not been es
timated Bucket brigades were formed
and men and women alike fought the
flames valiantly, but to no purpose. Ex
hausted women and children huddled in
little groups wherever shelter could be
found from the biting cold of the night
and early morning. Neighboring towns
were asked for assistance in lighting the
fire, but before it could be rendered the
high wind had swept the flames through
the place, making the devastation com
plete.
As soon as the management of the Lou
isville, Henderson and St. Louis Railroad
learned that hundreds of people were
homeless they ordered every available
coach .between Louisville and Henderson
hurried to Cloverporf, and in these the
unfortunates will, foÂ» the time being,
make their homes. The management also
sent 5000 loaves of. bread and other food.
Not a store was left in town where a
mouthful of food could be obtained. Ad
jutant General Murray telegraphed that
500 tents had been dispatched from Frank
fort, and the authorities at Louisville
wired that a tralnload of relief supplies,
quickly gathered, would leave at noon.
At noon the fire was still burning In
Bpots, but little is left for It to devour, the
few remaining houses being scattered and
away from the business and residence
Bection of the town. There were a few
minor accidents, but so far as known no
one was seriously injured.

I Conference.
The members of the Pacific Commercial
Museum and the Sausalito commuters
have reached an agreement concerning
the space that was desired by both parties
in the ferry building. A conference took
place yesterday in the ferry building,
which -was attended by Harbor Commis
sioner Paris Kilburn, President Irving M.
Scott of the Commercial Museum and
General Dickinson, representing the Sau
salito commuters.
It was made clear that there was room
enough In the building for the museum
and for the commuters. After gome dis
cussion of the situation an agreement
was reached which will leave the commut
ers the space that they have had at the
north end of the building; with a little
curtailment, and will Rive the museum
space farther south. The fence that tha
museum erected will be moved. This ar
rangement will avoid crowding tho com
muters together on the lower floor of the
building. It is reported by Commissioner
Kilburn to be 'jatisfactory to all parties.

Mexican President's Health Is Ro

Discredit the Information.
EL. PASO. Tex.. March 14.â To-day a
dispatch was received from a banker at
Cuernavaca, Mexico, where President
Diaz is sojourning for his health, which
says there is no truth in the report that
the President is in a dangerous condition
or that the end is near. The writer say;*
he saw Diaz last evening and his health
is good.
The information contained in the dis
patch is not generally credited here and
an El Paso afternoon paper says edi
torially to-day: "We are inclined to be
lieve that the closest friends and sup
porters of President Diaz are trying to
conceal the President's real condition in
the en'deavor to avoid trouble and to pro
pare for what mus:' be the inevitable
issueâ the death of the ruler. It is also
likely tUst there is a large amount of
intrigue and â¢ even plots that savor of
treason among certain portions of the
upper classes of the people, while it is
unlikely that there would be much if any
assistance to be gained from the masses
of the people."
The Rev. Robert Coyle, Formerly of
Oakland, Will Not Go to a Los

DENVER, March 14.â Rev. Robert F.
Coyle, who startled the congregation of
the Central Presbyterian Church last
Sunday by resigning, his position as pas
tor, has been prevailed upon to reconsider
his decision and to remain in Denver. He
will announce his determination to stay
in his pulpit next Sunday.
During the week Dr. Ooyle has had a
large number of visits from his parish
loners, all of whom assured him of their
approval of his methods of conducting
the church and of their personal favor
and desire to co-operate with him in his
work, and all of whom begged of him not
to carry Into effect his decision to accept
a church in Los Angeles. These calls
were not without their effect upon Dr.
Coyle and his wavering desire not to go
became a fixed purpose last night, when
at a meeting of the elders of the church
ail the differences and misunderstandings
between pastor and people were cleared
up. Mr. Coyle came to Denver from Oak
land five months ago.
GRAVE WILL BE HERE
IF BODY IS FOUND
Captain Ward's Brother Says There
Was No Dispute About Posses
sion of the Remains.
DENVER, March 14.-C. E. Ward,
brother of Captain William Ward of the
steamship Rio de Janeiro, returned to his
home hero last night after an absence of
three weeks, during which time he en
gaged actively in efforts to locate the
steamer and recover the bodies of the
victims.
"There was no dispute as to the posses
sion of the body or my brother in the
event of its recovery," said Mr. Ward.
"There was a woman in San Francisco
who said that she wanted the body burled
there if it was found. Her wishes will bo
respected. My brother, John Ward of
Raleigh. N. C, arrived in San Francisco
a few days ago and he will remain there
for a month to take charge of tha body
in case It Is found."
While the New York Senators had been
disposed to oppose Colonel Sanger, the/
realized that the assistant to a Cabinet
officer should be in harmony with b!a
chief and they decided not to carrv their
opposition any further. Colonel Sanger's
confirmation by the Senate will not be
opposed by them. â¢
The New York Senators. Platt and Depew.
called uj>on the President this morning and for
the first time Colonel Sanger"s appointment as
Assistant Secretary of War was referred to.
Having gone over the matter fully with the
Secretary of War, they decided to offer no op
position to Colonel Saneer's appointment.
Some time before the expiration of the last
administration and before the reappolntment of
the Cabinet, Assistant Secretary Melklejohn
notified the President that, by reason of his
candidacy for the Senate, the long canvass at
tending it and the necessity that there should
be an assistant secretary who could be present
in Washington to perform the duties of the of
fice, he was unwilling to permit his name to *e
considered for reappolntment. William Carey
danger has. accordingly, been appointed and
will immediately enter upon the discharge of
his duties.
Senators Platt and Depew of New York
called at the White Hou?e to-day and
were with the President one hour. When
they left the following statement was
made in connection with their visit:
The following official statement was
made by the Secretary of War this after
noon in regard to the appointment:
the regulation oath of office. In it he
stated his residence as Sangerfield. N. Y.
The new Assistant Secretary Is a guest
at the house of Secretary Root and tho
two took luncheon there this afternoon.
Acording to an arrangement made in the
meeting Colonel Sanger at once took for
mal possession of the office of Assistant
Secretary and was introduced to the
bureau chiefs and all other principal offi
cers of the department. Later he was
presented to the President by Secretaiy
noot.
COLONEL WILLIAM C. SANGER,
APPOINTED ASSISTANT SECRE
TARY OF WAR.
NEW YORK, March 14.â "William Mar
coni of wireless telegraph fame arrived
here to-day, a passenger on the White
Star line steamship Majestic from Liver
pool. He will probably go to Washington
in a day or so to consult with the authori
ties there concerning the Introduction of
his system info the United States navy.
He said to a Call reporter that his plans
were rather indefinite and he could not
announce his programme.
One of the principal objects of his visit
is to establish stations on the American
coast for the purpose of signaling incom
ing vessels. Had the Mafconl system been
in use at this port, for instance, it. would
have been possible for the approach of
the Majestic to have been announced
while she was 200 miles out at sea.
It mleht also have been used by the
Rio de Janeiro. If a wireless telegraph
message could have been sent instantly
to an intelligent operator at the life-sav
inpr station, instead of having to rely upon
steam whistles and a stupid fellow like
lookout Mark Ellingsen. assistance might
have gone to the Rio de Janeiro in time
to have saved some lives at least. And
had Captain Ward been able to announce
by wireless message to the Pacific Mail's
officers his ship's approach to the Golden
<Jate he would not have been so eager to
steam up to the docks, for It was his anx
iety to report the arrival of his overdue
steamer that caused the disaster.
Mr. Marconi said that the United States
was slower in adopting the wireless tele
graph than were England and other Euro
pean countries. He declared he could not
at present tell where stations, in this coun
try would be established. He remarked
that he had many business Interests to
attend 1o in the United States and that
he would make no' experiments, as the
workings of the system were now defl-~
nitely established and he Is able to signal
vessels at a distance of 200 miles.

I am positive that this is the best Toilet Soap ever made. I Icnow it because it is the result of a long series of experiments to secure
the best at any cost. I know that it will soften the roughest skin, that it will cure chapped hands and lips in a single night, and I know that
mothers will say it is just what baby's delicate body needs. If your hands are rough, try it ; if you have facial blemishes, try it ; if you have
dandruff, try it ; if you wish your skin to be soft as velvet, try it. It is absolutely free from those poisonous animal fats from which most
toilet soaps are made. It does not contain one atom of those destructive alkalies Which burn, torture and irritate the skin.
I am offering this Soap to the public at the price of 15 cents for a large cake, and 5 cents for a trial cake.
Those who have tried my remedies â my Cold Cure, my Rheumatism Cure and my other specifics for various diseases â will not as1c

To all whom It may concern:
In December. 1899. I was taken
sick with Black Typhoid Fever,
the most virulent tvpe known
to medical science. I had hem-
orrhages, both r.;i3al and Intes-
tinal, eight of the latter occur-
lng In one day. Dr. Wong
Woo. the eminent Chinese phy-
sician, was called, and with one- close of hH
tea stopped the flow of blood, thereby saving
my life, as I had been given up by my white
physician, as well as by all my frlenda. Was
unconscious four weÂ«ks. but by Dr. Wonsr Woo's
wonderful skill he saved my life from this most
fatal of all fevers. Although I was confined to
my bed three months, was able to resume my
vocation In six months from the time t went t(Â»

Why Suffer From This Dreadful Disease, When
Science Has Conquered It?
Nearly one thousand permanent cures have baen
made here in your midst. Over nVe hundred in the city
of San Francisco alone; business men of tne first rank,
some of whom you may know, and who for the sake of
suffering humanity are willing to be privately in-
terviewed.
There is nothing: to dread; the treatment is faultless;
no surgery, caustics, ligature or salves, and no. delay
from business.
ANY CASE. NO MATTER HOW SEVERE OR OF HOW
LONG STANDING, no matter how many salves you may
have tried (for they are all delusions), can be perma-
nently cured in a very short while if scientifically
treated by a skilled PHYSICIAN.

CHICAGO. March 14.â Strength and bullish
activity, tcgether with the punishment of
shorts in wheat, came at the opening as a re
sult of an advance at Liverpool and the light
ness of Northwest receipts, due partly to un
favorable weather. May opened UÂ®He higher
at T5vÂ»2. Outside interests and the silent
speculators who work through brokers in the
majority of cases support the market, while
the crowd which was long sold liberally to
secure profits. The demand was heavy, how
ever, and during most of the forenoon the
market fluctuated between 75?Â»c and 75%Â®76c.
A good cash demand and liberal -clearances st
' the seaboard were supporting influences fol
lowing the opening. During the afternoon the
corn break brought additional selling pressure
on the market and liny was forced down to
75Â«ic The close was heavy, Me lower at
Tj*Â»5i75Hc.
Corn was very strong at the opening and
continued so for an hour and a half. Realiz
ing caused a decline. May leaving off a shade
lower at 41VÂ«c.
Although the profit-taking movement in pro
visions was generally of an aggressive order
the market was not forced much below its
recently attained high mark. Lard and ribs
were sold on a liberal scale by packers, but
the trade !n nork war comparatively light.
May pork closed 20c lower, lard 6@7Vic down
and ribs 7V6@10c depressed.
Oats were narrow. Thecloee was a shade

Into better shape. Liverpool was higher, but
it was,Â«. holiday at Paris. There was no par
ticular change in New Tork. The foreign mar
kets are not inclined to follow- any American
decline.
Chicago opened firmer on better foreign ad
vices, .with the cash demand improving and
more disposition to buy. The whole list was
strong, and the market was largely oversold.
The Cincinnati Price Current says that there
has been no material damage thus far from
freezing, and that the general condition of the
crop Is favorable. The damage from Hessian
fly is still uncertain. The market is now al
most on an export basis, and 200.000 bushels
were worked for this account, while Buffalo
was reported sold out. Wall street started in
to buy again, and the shorts began to cover.
Thus it will be seen that the situation is de
cidedly bullish.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
All descriptions under this head seem to be
working Into better shape. Stocks of Butter
are lighter, as the last steamer for the north
took out a large line, and the next steamer
will also take a liberal shipment. The feeling
Is now steady. Eggs, too, have lately gone
so freely Into storage that there are not many
on the market now, in spite of the liberal re
ceipts. Cheese stands about the same as be
fore quoted.
Receipts as reported by the" Dairy Exehinsre
were: 43,600 pounds of Butter, 1545 cases Eggs,
22,250 pounds California Cheese and pounds
Eastern Cheese.

American District Telegraph Com
pany Petitions Supervisors for
Privileges.
The American District Telegraph Com
pany is beginning to feel the competition
of the. California Messenger Company,
which is composed of boys, and yesterday
President Charles Ackerman of the first
named corporation appeared before the
Street Committee of the Board of Super
visors with a demand for the same priv
ileges now enjoyed by the boys' company.
"'Superintendent of . Electricity Hewitt
was authorized two years ago to define
the common points at which overhead
wires were to cross certain streets," said
Ackerman. "but that official has taken
no action. We ask to be permitted to
string our wires overhead and to operate
a 'push button' system, so as toenable us
to compete with the boy messenger com
panies, who enioy the privileges named:
We ask that Mr. Hewitt be cited to ap
pear and explain wh,y he has not denned
the common points of crossing and show
why we. should not he given equal priv
ileges with the boys."
The matter went over until next Thurs
day, when representatives of the two
companies will be cited to appear.

AFRAID OF BOYS' SERVICE
LONDON, March 14.-In the House of
Lords to-day Lord Salisbury warmly sup
ported the Bishop of Winchester's habit
ual drunkards' bill. He said he was en
tirely In sympathy with the measure,
which fixes higher penalties than in tha
case of simple drunkenness, especially In
the case of a person drunk Â¦when In
charge of a child.
The bill provides that habitual drunk
enness should be treated as persistent
cruelty and entitle a wife tb divorce. The
sale of liquors to inebriates is forbidden.
Lord Salisbury said he hoped that ho or
the Government might succeed in passing
the bill. What was ordinarily called tem
perance legislation was diminishing th^i
power of obtaining Intoxicants. This class
of legislation was uirected against per
sons guilty of intemperance, but it also
affected the large body who were thereby
restricted in their natural liberty by the
desire qf legislators to deal with In
ebriates, which seemed to*be unjust.
The bill was passed to Its second read
Ing.
Salisbury Approves of the
Measure Fixing Higher
Penalties.
FAVORS HABITUAL
DRUNKARDS' BILL
This will- cause some' rearrangement of
other offices. It will leave a vacancy in
the District Attorney's office, where
Judge Melvin was chief deputy, and it
will probably make necessary â¢ another
deputy in that office to act as prosecutor
of that court, there being one Deputy
District Attorney for each court at pres
ent. It is probable that Assemblyman
David F. McWade will be given one place
in the office. The young Assemblyman
from Alameda County' is already an ad
mitted attorney with a substantial prac
tice and stands very high in his profes-
Fion 'or a young man. He has made an
admirable Vecord at Sacramento for a
first term member, and has accomplished
much for Alameda County by his care
ful work. His term as Assemblyman
closes with this session and it is probable
that his good work at Sacramento will be
rewarded.
Judge Melvin will have a conference
with his associates upon the bench of
this county to-morrow, and there will be
pome arrangement made with the other
four Judges about quarters, and the as
signment of cases. It Is -probable that
the new court will t>e devoted exclusively
.to probate, and all new cases and some
of the pending ones will be assigned to
the new department.
The bill becomes operative at once, and
while. Alameda County has no place in
which its new Judge can sit. it has a
new Judge. It is expected, however, that
the new court will be put into operation
in the rooms of the Board of Supervisors,
and that it will begin work next week,
when Judge Melvin will ascend the bench
in the presence of his friends and fellow
members of the Alameda County Bar As
sociation. â¢
OAKLAND. March 14.-Harry A.
Melvin. chief deputy In the Dis
trict Attorney's office, arrived
from Sacramento to-night with
the bill creating a fifth Superior
Judge for Alameda County In his pocket,
signed by Governor Gage, and in the
pocket with the bill was his commission
as Judge, signed, also, by the Governor.
In response to a question from Mr. Mott.
Attorney Moore paid the reason the com
pany had restrained the Council from
passing an ordinance was because his
dfenta had information that the Council
was about to establish rates on the basis
nf a J3.OOi.oon valuation. Mott retorted that
there had not been a slnple expression
during the inquiry which would give the
company the slightest ground for knowing
what valuation would be placed on the
water company's property.
OAKLAND. March 14â Lewis A. Hicks,

Miss Smith's first altfmnt to pass out

prison keepers discovered her condition.
After she was restored the policemen were
assured that the experience was enough,
but the young woman forgot her pledge.
Only a few weeks later she repeated the

Soon after the shooting Look On was
taken to the Receiving Hospital. His
wounds are serious, but not necessarily
fatal.
The trouble among Chinese in San Jose
has cost numerous lives and is due to
quarrels over Chinese girls. .The Celes
tials of the Garden City are in direct
touch with the highbinders, of San Fran
cisco, and it is not a difficult matter to
trace- the shooting of this morning to a
desire of the members of the- tongs to
carry on the warfare in this city. The
agents of the rival tongs met in. this/ city
a week ago and practically agreed to
transfer the scene of strife to the larger
field presented by San Francisco's Chi
nese Quarter. !Â¦Â¦
The shooting is the result of the war
that has been wa?cil for the last six
months in San Jose and is regarded as
the forerunner of many more desperate
affrays in the Chinese quarter of this city.

WASHINGTON. March 14.â The Vene
zuelan Charge, Senor Pulido, says there
need be no fear of Governmental compli
cations growing out of the recent asphalt
affairs in Venezuela and the course of Mr.
Loomls, the United States Minister. Any
criticisms which have been made of Mr.
Loomis are said to come from private
sources and not to bo shared by the re
sponsible officials of Venezuela. The local
representatives of the company have
printed articles, appeared In the United
States arraigning Venezuela as a "blood
thirsty country," and; these have. caused
considerable irritation and adverse press
comment. But so far as the Venezuelan
Government is concerned frequent com
munications to Senor Pulido show that
the most friendly sentiment continues to
bÂ« entertSUned for the United States.
While there has been no occasion to diÂ«.
cu83 Mr. Loomi3 f status, yet Mr. Pulido
la satisfied that the reported . feeling
against him is not shared by officials.

MOST SUFFER
F0R H ER CRIME
For th*se reasons, briefly and Imperfectly
stated, and for many others which might be
given at length, I am unable to approve the
bill now- before rat. Very resnectfully,
HEBER M. WELLS, Governor.
I yield to no one affection; for those of ' my
people who from the highest motives, and be
cause they believed it a divine command, en
tered . Into the relation of plural marriage.
Born and reared in Utah, myself a product
of the marriage system, taught from Infancy
to regard my lineage approved by the Al
mighty, and proud to-day, as I have ever been
of my heritage, it will be granted, I trust,
that every instinct of my nature reaches out
to blilelil my friends from harm and to pro
tect them from unjust attacks. Their cause is
my cause, and when they are hurt, I am
hurt, for I am part of them. But In that
same heart which Is filled. with sympathy for
them. I find also the solemn feeling that this
bill holds out only a false hope of protection,
and that in offering a phantom of relief to a
few, it In reality invites a deluge of discord
and disaster upon all.
In my opinion nothing can be clearer than
that this bill, if passed, would be welcomed
and employed as a most effective weapon
against the very classes whose condition it Is
Intended to ameliorate. Furthermore, I have
every reason to believe its enactment would
be the. signal for a general demand upon the
national Congress for a constitutional amend
ment directed solely against certain social con
ditions here, a demand, which under the cir
cumstances, would assuredly be compiled with.
While it may be urged that in any event only
the few could be made to suffer, is it not an
odious thought, repulsive to every good citi
zen of whatsoever creed or party, that the whole
State should thus be put under a ban 7 Sure
ly there is none so selfish and. unpatriotic a*
to argue that this is preferable to the endur
ance of a few Isolated Instances of prosecu
tion â unbacked, as they , are. by either re
spectable moral support or sympathy. All of
us can readily recall the conditions of the past
as compared with those of to-day. In the
shortest memory still remain incidents of that
distressing period shortly before statehood
during which bo much sorrw and bitterness
stalked through our community. Of still' more
recent dateâ no lonper than two years ago â
another outburst was threatened and to some
extent was manifested. But as a termination
of the first came concession, and amnesty,
and evidences of good faith, and at length
statehood. In which everybody rejoiced: and
while as a rc-sult of the second, the sun of
our prosperity was. for a time obscured, the
clouds at length have rolled away, and Utah,
united, hopeful -ami - 4 vigorous. â Is- marchirj;
bravely forward to'tl^ mUslc'ofthe'unlori.""-
The patience, loyalty and conservatism of
our citizens are so widely recognized that only
by the passage of such a bill as this can
their reputation be injured. The broad-mlndetl
and intelligent everywhere accept the situation
here as it exists, and are content to let time
complete the solution of the problem. Kven
the bigoted and the meddlesome have to admit
that with rare exceptions the conduct and in
tegrity of the people are above reproach.
But these conditions only serve to make the
responsibility of the executive the more
weighty, and I could have wished to be spared
the test. Nevertheless, the recollection of my
oath of office, the requirements of my duty
as I understand it, and the conviction of my
own best Judgment and my conscience, unite
in demanding of me that I withhold approval
from this bill. If I know myself. I can sin
cerely say that I am anxious that the very
best and wisest thing shall be done in respect
to all matters that have vexed us so much in
times past. And knowing this whole people as
I do. it is my firm conviction that whatever
the present feeling may be they will be sin
cerely grateful In the, days to come if thla
measure Is not written upon thÂ« statute books.
Xo official act of my life has been approach
ed by me with a sense of responsibility bo pro
found as Is Involved In the consideration of
this bill. It is a measure of the supremest
importance, and in its consequences for good or
ill it easily surpasses any other proposition
that ever came before this commonwealth for
legislative and executive determination. . It
has been argued in both branches of the As
sembly .with splendid force and ability, while
Its provisions have doubtless been eagerly dls
cussfd in the remotest hamlet of our State.
With due allowance for the exaggerations that
may be expected from those, who warmly sup
port, and from those who with equal warmth
antagonize the measure, I accord to all of
them, without any reservation whatever, full
credit for absolute sincerity, breadth of sym
pathy, and a desire for the public welfare,
which of themselves render it a noteworthy
and unique piece of proposed legislation.
To the Senate: I have the honor to return
herewith, without 'â¢ approval. Senate bill No.
113, â¢ 4 an act amending section 4611 of the Re
vised Statutes of Utah, 1898, In. relation to the

EECOMMENDS EMPLOYMENT
OF FIFTEEN POLICEMEN
Police Commissioners Appeal to Su
pervisors â Lottery Lists May
Not Be Published.
President Newhall of the Board of Po-
lice Commissioners appeared before the
Supervisors' Police Committee yesterday
with a petition for the employment of
thirty-five additional patrolmen. He said
that the men." were absolutely necessary
and the commission had a fund of $11,000
at its disposal for their remuneration.
Chief Sullivan stated that the Sunset dis
trict was in need of police protection and
the men would -be distributed there, at
Holly Park in the Mission district and
wherever needed. The committee decided
to recommend to the board the appoint
ment of fifteen policemen.
The committee reported in favor of < the
proposed ordinance- prohibiting publica
tion of lottery drawings in newspapers or
by any other method. There was no dis
cussion over thÂ© ordinance, both Tobln
and Stafford voting in its favor. The
penalty for violation Is fixed at $500 fine
or imprisonment for six months.
The committee recommended that the
gum of $250 paid by Charles Rosenberg as
fees to the poundkeeper for the. â¢ release
of a- band of sheep which was Impounded
while his employes were driving them to
Butchertown be refunded to Rosenberg.
The committee reported in favor of the
ordinance requiring . the Chief of Police
and Chief Engineer of the Fire Depart
ment-to strictly enforce the fire and police
regulations at. amateur boxing exhibi
tions; also restricting the number of per
sons attending them to the seating capa
city of the place, and requiring clubs giv
ing such exhibitions to be members of the
Pacific Athletic Association.
Theodore Kytka, handwriting expert,
created a sensation in the United States
Circuit Court yesterday afternoon when
he swore that tho bill of sale of California
and Nevada Railroad bonds purporting to
have been signed In August. 1S05. by J. W.
Smith, deceased, in favor of his son.
Charles H. Smith, was evidently the fly
leaf torn from a book and bearing the
genuine signature of J. W. Smith, as J.
W. Smith used to write fifteen years ago.
He swore further that the body of the bill
of sale was written about ten years later
than the signature, and that Ink of two
different kinds and of different ages ap
pears in each." .V
In proof of his statement he showed
Judge Morrow the admittedly genuine
signature of J. W. Smith to several bank
checks written on the day and on the day
after the date of the bill of sale, showing
that at that time, which was In August.
1S35. J. W. Smith wrote his name tremu
lously, whereas fifteen years ago his sig
nature was firm in every line. The signa
ture on the bill of sale showed no tremor
whatever, he said.
The bill of sale was of 304 bonds of the
California and Nevada Railroad Company
valued, at the present time, at about $65.
000.\ It was written on a small scrap of
unsized paper, such as is used in printed
books.
Mr. Kytka turned the microscope upon
the writing and showed the Judge how
the ink in the signature had become oxid
ized, thus proving Its age. while the con
trary was the case with the Ink in the
body of the bill. He swore that the body
of the bill could not have been written
earlier than five years ago. and that it
was written probably as recently as three
C. K. King, the administrator, testified
as to several conversations he had had
with J. TV. Smith regarding the Intentions
of the testator as to the disposition of his
property. Mr. King said that in those
talks J. W. Smith fold him that he had
given his children tee greater part of his
property, and that ne had given his son
Charles his Interest in the railroad. That
was a month previous to the death of
Smith. It was for that reason that the
witness had not entered the railroad
bonds as a part of the estate. Mr. King
identified the signature on the assignment
as that of J. W. Smith, although it lacked
the rubric apparent on the bank check
signatures. He declined, however, to
pwear positively to the genuineness of the
E Then the claimant. Charles H. Smith,
was put upon the stand. He told about
his coming to this city from Denver. Colo..
In July. 1895. and about his father dying
on November 15 of the same year. He was
in his father's room on August 14. 1S95.
on which occas'.cn he handed the witness
a small scrap of paper and requested him
to writÂ® upon It a bill of sale of the rail
road bonds. The witness did so,- and wrote
the assignment, which was afterward pro
duced in court. His father then read It.
said that it was "all right," got up out of
bed. sat down at the table and signed his
name to It. He looked at his signature
and remarked, "That is a pretty good sig
nature," and handed the witness the
paper.
The witness went on to say that after
that occurrence his father told Captain
W. R. Thomas and Abner Doble that he
had given the railroad bonds to his son
Charles. He said to the witness: "Char
ley. I have given Mr. Doble an order to
deliver those bonds, and I have told him
that they belong to you." Doble after
ward delivered the bonds to the witness,
who, at Doble's reque3t. gave him a re
ceipt In the name of "J. W. Smith, per C.
H. Smith."
On cross-examination the witness said
that he wrote the body of the assignment
on a desk in his father's room, and that
his father signed It on a table about an
hour later. He was not sure as to wheth
er or not the signature was or was not
made with the same pen and ink as was
used in wrltins the body of the bill of
sale.
The case will be argued this morning.

Eminent Principal of the Hamilton Grammar School
Succumbs to Prolonged Attack of Dropsy.
John B. Hewitt of Bakersfleld. who has
won a fortune within the last few years
through lucky speculations in oil lands in
Kern County, has flled in the- County
Clerk's office an affidavit denying that ho
married Mary E. Hewitt, who recently
brought suit for divorce against him. she
charging cruelty. He admits, however,
that they entered into a written agree
ment at Redding, Shasta County, March
26, 1S91, to live together, but now claims
that the paper is not vilid as a marriage
contract. He further sets up the defense
that on February 25, 1SJ0. the plaintiff ad
mitted that she had been guilty of Infi
delity and "as a just punishment" for
her wrongdoing she waived all claims she
might have upon him or his property.
This paper, which is made part of the af
fidavit, was acknowledged March 20, lS&Q,
before H. P. Bender, a. Justice of tho
Peace, who is also a partner of Hewitt
in his oil land speculations. On the same
day the plaintiff, on j;ayment of $200,
signed a release on both Hewitt and his
fortune, it is alleged. Upon this showing
Hewitt has asked the court to dissolve
the injunction issued when the suit was
commenced restraining him from dispos
ing of any of his property interests during
the pendency of the litigation. < * â¢
The discarded wife to whom three
children were born while she was living
vith Hewitt, intends makinc a hard
struggle for recognition of herself arid
babies. If she succeeds Hewitt will be
placed in a serious position, inasmuch as
he has married since their separation. If
the marriage contract is declared valid
Hdwltt is liable to prosecution for big
amy and it is not Improbable that he will
be arrested on that charge before the civil
proceedings are finally disposed of by
Judge Hunt, to whom the case has been
assigned for trial.
Mrs. Hewitt, in reply to the affidavit
made by Hewitt, filed with the County
Clerk yesterday a counter affidavit,
in which she details the alleged circum
stances under which she signed the re
lease. She alleges that the documems
were signed under duress and that sho
affixed and acknowledged her signature
to them believing her life to be in daji
ger. She alleges that at the time of sign
ing the papers, February 25, 1S99. she was
about to become a mother and that Hew
itt threw her on the floor, called her v!l<?
and abusive names and threatened to beat
her to death if she refused to sign the
documents or ever divulge the fact that
she had been forced to sign them. She
further alleges that after signing the pa
pers she begged Hewitt to be allowed to
remain at their home in Bakersfleld untU
she could find some other home and take
her children with her. Hewitt permitted
her to remain and they continued marital
relations until March 20. 1S99, when he
again became violent, cursed and abused
her, struck her in the face and threat
ened to kill her. He demanded that she go
with him to his office and acknowledge
bfore Notary Public Bender the papers
signed by her some weeks before. She
claims that he again threatened her with
death if she refused to obey and instruct
ed her to answer "yes" to all questlon3
asked her by the Notary. Under these
cicumstances and conditions she acknowl
edged the papers. The following day Hew
itt drove her from the house and, in the
words of her affidavit, "compelled her to
go to the city of San Francisco an.i
threatened that if she ever returned he
would beat her to death or cause her In
carceration in prison." In conclusion she
alleges that at the time she acknowledged
the papers on which Hewitt bases hts
defense there was no onepresent but her
self. Hewitt and Notary Bender, her hus
band's partner, . and that she. had no op
portunity to appeal to any one for pro
tection or assistance. She asks that Hew
itt's motion to dissolve the injunction be
denied and that she be awarded alimony
and counsel fees pending the trial of the
suit.
The matter will come up for hearing this
morning before Judge Hunt.
When Mrs. Hewitt left Bakersfleld Hew
itt refused to allow her to take their thre^
children. Myrtle, Gladvs and John B..
with her. They disappeared from Bakers
fleld soon afterward and it was generally
understood that they had been placed in a
private school In Los Angeles by the fa
ther. The mother made several efforts
to find them, but she was not successful
until a few days ago, when she learned
that they were In charge of a charitable
institution in Oakland. It l<* said that
Hewitt turned them over to the institu
tion, saying that he would never recog
nize them again.

PASSES AWAY AT LIVERMORE
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 15, 1901.
Dragged to His Death.
Paul W. Hack, formerly a corporal of
Company D, Twenty-first Infantry, was
killed yesterday afternoon by being
thrown between a dummy and car on the
Union-street line.
Hack and a comrade named Leary sig
naled a Union-street car to stop at Polk
street Leary boarded the car first, and
while Hack, who was slightly lame, was
attempting - to ste.P ' on the car was
started. The Jerk threw the unfortunate
fellow between the wheels of the dummy
and car, and he was dragged a consider
able distance before the car could be
stopped. He was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, Â¦where it Â¦was found that he
had a fractured skull and internal in
juries.- He died a few hours later. The
police were sent to arrest the grlpman.

occupy a slab at the Morgue and at the
home of his parents, 23 Boardman place,
his father and mother are bemoaning the
fate that robbed them of a bright and
manly son. His life was crushed out by
car 41 of the San Mateo electric line yes
terday shortly after 5 p. m. on Bryant
street, between Sixth and Seventh.
The little fellow had attempted to cross
the street and was struck by the car, the
approach of which he failed to notice. The
motorman. John Powell, stopped the car
bo suddenly that the front wheels left the
track, but it was too late. The accident
was witnessed by an elder brother of
young Gandolfo. who was standing In the
doorway of a saloon kept by his father.
Motorman Powell was arrested, taken
to the City Hall and charged with
manslaughter. He ssaid he did not see the
little fellow,until the car was almost upon
him. He reversed the current and threw
on the brakes, but his efforts to stop the
car in time were without avail.
Willie Connors, a, 15-year-old newsboy,
was thrown from a cart near the corner of
Powell and Market streets yesterday
afternoon and received injuries which re
sulted in his death.. The boy, in company
with a carrier on the Evening Post, was
driving along Market street In a delivery
cart. When nearly opposite Fifth street
the horse stumbled and the Connors boy,
who was standing on the rear step, was
thrown hackward into the street, striking
on the back of his head.
Officer Rellly of the Southern Station
had the injured boy hurried to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where Dr. Morrison did what
he could to relieve the sufferer. The boy
lingered until nearly 6 o'clock, when he
succumbed to his injuries. Death resulted
from concussion of the brain.
The boy resided with his parents at 167
Linden avenue and was their only child.
