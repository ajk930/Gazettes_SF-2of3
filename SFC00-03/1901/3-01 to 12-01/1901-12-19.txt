TWO OVERLAND TRAINS CRASH TOGETHER IN MONTEREY
COUNTY AND THERE ARE FEARS OF HEAVY LOSS OF LIFE
TWO Southern Pacific overland trains came into collision near Upland, in Monterey County, this morning at 2 o'clock, At this hour, 5 a. m=,
it is not known if there was any loss of life, but it is believed that the north-bound train is in flames. A large number of surgeons and
a wrecking train were sent from San Francisco at 4 a. m., and at about the same hour another wrecking train, accompanied by surgeons, was
It is probable that there has been loss of life and maiming of trainmen and passengers. The two trains reported in collision are: No. 9,
north bound, which was due to arrive here at 7:30 this morning, ;and No. 1 o, south bound, which left here last evening.
Superintendent Frazier of the coast division of the Southern Pacific said that they had only meager information up to 4 o'clock. He said
the two trains were reported to have collided near Upland, the engines crashing together head on, and that the two locomotives were demolished.
As this indicated a serious wreck he said I surgeons were summoned and wrecking trains ordered out from both this city and SanLuis Obispo.

The expected has happened. Strife and
acrimony over the division of patron
age have disorganized and demolished the
governing body of the Union Labor par
ty. In the hope of restoring harmony and
preventing a general outbreak In every
labor camp that sent delegates to the
late nominating convention Mayor-elect
Scbmitz has Intervened, but there is no
sign that his intervention will soften the
asperities of the struggle. It happens un
fortunately for the Mayor-elect that the
number of candidates for official favor
under his coming administration of mu
nicipal affairs Is far in excess of the
number of appointments allotted to the
Mayor. As soon as his selections of men
to serve on thÂ© commissions^ are an
nounced the army of the disappointed will
increase and the' "turned down" will rise
up to ensile the musician in the Mayor's
chair.
The Rocfc of Patronage.
The provision of the charter vesting in
thÂ» Mayor almost autocratic power may
t1vÂ« bins â¢trencth a* an executive to car
ry out Â»oraÂ» particular policy, but from
a political point of view It Is an element
of weaknemt rather than of vtrength. The
appointing power waa tha rock that
wrecked Mayor Phelan'i political craft.
It can hardly bÂ« expected that Behmitt
will es'.n wisdom by noting Phelan'a blun
der*. The &Â«v Mayor displayed eomÂ«
personal characteristic* of rough and
ready leadership when he went to the
front night before last and restored J. B.
Parry to the chairmanship of the party'a
executive committee from which place
the latter had been deposed by a clam
orous faction. The Inside tip Is to tha
effect that A. Ruef, Eugene E. Schmitz
and J. 6. Parry.- who were active promot
ers of the Republican Primary League,
discovered behind a group of Democratic
politicians in the camp of the Union La
j,or party the shadow of Boss Buckley"6
Viand and forthwith resolved that the
City Hall pastures should not be opened
to the lambs of old.
Parry in the Saddle Again.
Mayor-elect Bchmitz promptly placed
Parry in the saddle again and the latter
is riding with a free rein. Where Parry
viil ride to is yet conjecture. He may
dismount in Congress,' or he may be dis
mounted before he reached an ordinary
place In the municipal administration.
Leaders of the deposed faction will not
stand too much rough riding. Already
they have taken counsel of a lawyer and
threatened to go to the courts with their
grievances. The final appeal for redress,
however, will be taken at the ballot box
in the next election. Meanwhile Parry is
cavorting. He is planning to extend the
Union Labor organization to other cities
and making calculations that the party
can elect thirty-five or forty members of

Chicago Man Makes His
Own Statement in
the Court.
CHICAGO, Dec. IS.â Alexander Sullivan
took the witness stand to-day in his own
defense on the charge of conspiracy, and
denied all the charges against him. He
said also that the persons who accuse him
of wrongdoing have spoken falsely.
Thfe greater part of his testimony re
lated to his coming to Chicago, working
as a reporter on several Chicago papers
and finally going into law. He said he
knew James J. Lynch, the jury briber an'!
prosecuting witness; also Frederick St.
John and George P. Murray. He said he
knew St. John to be an employe of the
West Chicago City Railway, but denied
any conspiracy with him to keep Lynch
from the jurisdiction of the court.
Sullivan admitted that he knew Dan
Coughlin, of Cronin murder case noto
riety, but' denied ever having had deal
ings with him. He denied also any con
nection with the Grlnnell case and dis
claimed connection with the jury selecting
procedure in cases where there was jury
bribing.
Before Sullivan took the stand, Judge
Hutchinson testified in his behalf as a
"character witness," and ex-Judge T. A.
Morgan, who was Sullivan's attorney In
the Hanford murder trial, took the stand
for the same purpose. Morgan said he
had heard nothing derogatory to the de
fendant's character prior to the outburst
of the jury bribing deals of two years
ago.
Cross-examination by the State brought
out the comment by the former Judge
that he meant the terms "honesty and
integrity" in a strictly technical sense,
and that further than that he would not
go. He said the Cronin murder case had
brought out a great deal of comment on
the defendant's character, as did the Han
fcrd trials. ,--:-

BURY VICTIM
IN A TRENCH
Murderers Commit Ter
rible Crime in Salt
Lake City. .
SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 18.â The body
of James R. Hay, secretary of the Pacific
Lumber Company, was found this morn
ing burled in a shallow trench alongside
the Rio Grande tracks near Sixth East
and Thirteenth South streets.
Monday night Hay called at the home
of Peter Mortensen, a contractor, living
at 220 Walnut avenue, and collected $3800
which Mortensen owed the Pacific Lum
ber Company and which late in the after
noon-Hay had refused to accept, not car
ing to leave that amount in the office safe
over night. He gave a receipt to Morten
sen, for the money and left the latter's
house with the remark that he was going
to take the money to Manager G. K. Hom
ney of the "lumber company.' Since that
time nothing had been seen or heard of
Hay untllhis body was found thia morn
ing. The money was gone and In the
back of Hay's head was a jagged wound.
It is the theory of the police that some
one saw Hay receive ' the money from
Mortensen, followed him when he left the
house and murdered him. then buried the
body. in the hastily dug trench. Hay was
about 31 years of age, prominent in Mor
mon church work . and was implicitly
trusted by his employers. He- came to
Salt Lake from 'Australia several years
ago.
Peter MorteriWn, the contractor who
paid young Hay the money Monday night,
was arrested this afternoon, on suspicion
of beins connected with the murder and,
taken to Chief of Police Hilton's office.
Mortensen, it Is stated, gave the police
their first information in regard to the
location of the body and this determined
the police to - place him under arrest.
Mortensen denied all knowledge of the
crime. Considerable excitement has been
caused by the crime as young Hay was
exceedingly popular and open threats of
lynching are heard. . -.- - .
Late Tuesday night Captain of'Detec
tives Seymour received a dispatch from
the Chief of Police of Salt Lake, asking
him to arrest Hay. The dispatch read
that Hay had $3800 ih his possession and
the sender asked the local police to take
possession of It in case they arrested him.

when nine, the last of forty-nine judg

The suits were compromised by the pay

excess of the face value . of the bonds.
However, the bondholders will receive
only a part of this amount, there being

PLACING HEAVY
GUNS IN MANILA
Military Is Guarding
Against Rising of
Fortifications Are Constructed
at Points Hitherto
Unprotected.
{ Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec. 18.â The steam
ship Tosa Mara, which arrived from Yo
kohama and China ports to-day, brings
mall advices from Manila to the effect
that In view of the possible rising of na
tives in that city, fortifications are to be
established. The Manila Times says In
this regard:
"Artillery is being placed at points
about Manila hitherto unprotected, except
by small infantry guard detachments.
Two rapid fire gatling guns have been
placed in the headquarters department of
Southern Luzon and it is understood that
a small gunboat will take up a position in
the Lagoon, -% the rear of the headquar
ters building. The headquarters of the
department of Southern Luzon is in
Paco and only a mile from Santa. Ana.
This section of the city has always been
more or less a hotbed of Insurgents and
insurgent sympathizers. At the time of
the outbreak in February, 1S99. some of
the most desperate fighting that occurred
in Manila took place in that vicinity. The
civil authorities have several times made
arrests there of insurgents in league with
those In the field.
"Old Fort Santiago, too, is bristling with
guns. Two rapid firing gatlings have
been mounted on the ramparts, one of
them commanding a full sweep of the
Calle Principe and the river front. At
the point of the wall facing the river
three sentries, with powerful field glass
es, have been placed to scan the sur
rounding country. A small gatling has
been mounted on the Buffalo, General
Chaffee's private launch, which is moored
behind division headquarters." '
The same paper says: "The'Cavite ma
rines, to the number of 300, are stationed
at Balinguiga, the scene of the massacre,
and, in conjunction with the soldiers of
the Eleventh Infantry, will operate from
the south, searching and burning . the
country nothward, until they meet and
join hands [ with the Twenty-sixth,
Twelfth, Seventh and Ninth regiments.
This is the first part of the plan of cam
paign. When the southern part of the
island is thoroughly cleared, operations
will begin from Luzon and other points
in the vicinity to the southern line of
troops, thus. rounding up Lukban's army
for . the final extermination. Samar will
then be made a desert, where birds can
not live. . . â¢
"There is a bare possibility that, awed
by the terrible punishment about to be
inflicted, Lukban and his followers will
decide to throw themselves on the mercy
of the Americans, trusting to any terms
that may be glveYi." â¢
The article tells how the gunboats pa
trolling Samar. are harassing and burn
ing Coast towns, driving the rebels to the
interior.

MAY BE VICTIM
OF BAY DISASTER
Miss Josephine Smith Is
Missing From San ;
xtatael.
Friends Fear That She-Per
ished in the Ferry-boat .
Collision.
Special Dienatch to- Tbe Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 18.â The name of
another victim.may.be added to the list
of â  those who met death in the collision
of the ferry-boats San Rafael and Sausa
lito. Miss Josephine Smith of this city
has been missing since the collision. All
of her effects are at her home here and
no word has come from her.
Miss Smith has resided here a year.
She was a Seventh Day Adventist and
had been treating a number of persons
here for rheumatism. About four clays
before the accident she went to San
Francisco for a visit of a few days. No
one here knows whom she intended vis
iting. Robert Jones, with whose family
she lived in this city, believes that Mis=s
Smith was lost on the San Rafael.
This view is shared by Mrs. Mary
Lewis, with whom Miss Smith previously
boarded. Mrs. Lewis, who was a patient
of the missing woman, says that Miss
Smith intended returning on the night of
the collision. Mrs. Lewis can account for
her disappearance on no othex ground
than that she perished in the^acciderit.
She says that the lapse of more than two
weeks, during which time â¢no word has
been received, confirms the fears aroused
soon after the accident.

WAR IN UNION LABOR PARTY,
Continued From Page One.
In San Jose. Johnny Mackenzie is lead
ing one faction of Republicans and E. A.
Hayes is at the head of another. It seems
hardly possible for the Labor party to
get in without making alliance with one
faction or the other, but Parry, guided
by Mayor-elect Schmitz, may find an
opening.
Chapter of Inside History.
The inside history of the raid to oust
Parry and gain possession of the party
organfzation is interesting. Mayor-elect
Schmitz declined to make any promises
of patronage to certain members of the
committee, and they immediately jumped
to the conclusion that Parry was to get
all of it. Consulting among themselves
and taking advice of Buckley, they said,
"We will capture the works and force
Schmitz to our terms." Thirteen of the
twenty-five joined the movement and re
organized the commiltee, ousting Parry
from the chairmanship. Then the propo
sition was renewed 10 the Mayor-elect
that they would be satisfied with three
appointments â one for the Fire Commis
sion, one for the Board of Public Works
and one for the Election Commission.
They went so far as to name the men
whose appointment they desired.
Meanwhile the defeated candidates were
appealing for recognition. They were in
sisting that they carried the banner of
the party in the battle and went to de
feat with honor. They held a conference
and decided that they would be satisfied
if four places weje given to themâ one
Fire Commissioner, one Election Commis
sioner, one Police Commissioner and one
member of the Board of Public Works.
When the four were agreed upon every
defeated candidate whose choice was not
embraced in the list selected began an
agitation on his own account for patron
age. . .--â  -. â¢' -
The Mayor-elect having only eight com
missioners to appoint the appeal was em
barrassing. As one of the eight must be
an artist and another a physician he had
practically only six remaining. Of course
after satisfying the demands of defeated
candidates he would have had two for
the public generally if the executive com
mittee's bunch of thirteen had not de
manded three. All the demands have
not been registered. It is said that every
member of the executive committee ex
pects something for himself. The great
est roar ever heard in San Francisco will
be uttered when the Mayor-elect names
the new commissioners.
Failed to Secure Warrants.
The Buckley members of the commit
tee whose overthrow at Tuesday night's
meeting rankles deep are doing their ut
most to regain their lost prestige. Tim
othy Ryan and J. Lane, two of Delaney's
warmest supporters, called upon their at
torney, T. Carl, Spelling, yesterday morn
ing, and after a long conference the party
proceeded to the office of the warrant and
bond clerk at the Hall of Justice and de
manded two warrantsâone for the arrest
of C. Aubertine, secretary of the commit
tee, for the unlawful .conversion to his
own use of property belonging to the
committee and for the mutilation thereof
and the other to enable the officers to
search Aubertine's premises for the books
and documents in his possession.
Bond Clerk Peery considered the mat
ter and decided not to take action until
after mature reflection. He announced
his belief that the complainants were not
entitled to the warrants in question, and
Ryan and Lane were informed that the
matter would be given careful considera
tion. No warrant was issued during the
day, and. the chances are excellent that
none will be Issued unless more valid rea
sons for that step are assigned.
Unable to secure what they wanted
from Peery. the committeemen visited
the office of District Attorney Byington
and asked that he take some steps in the
premises. Byington declined to take any
action, claiming that he lacked Jurisdic

mittee had little legal standing thus far.
and that if it had a complaint the proper
body to adjust the same was the execu
tive committee itself.
Will File Suit in Court.
During the day a meeting* of the dis
satisfied members of the executive com
mittee was held in Attorney Spelling'*
office, and It was decided to take the mat
ter into court to-day. The precise nature
of ..*ie proceedings to be had was not di
vulged, but the impression prevails that
a writ of Injunction will be applied for in
order that the regularity of the act of
the Parry faction In seceding from the
main body mipht be determined. With
regard to the fillnsr Â«of the complaint to
day Attorney Spelling said:
There can be no question that" the action
taken at the meeting Tuesday evening by thÂ»
Parry faction Is illegal, and that the books
and papers of the committee are improperly
In the hands of Aubertine. The law grants to
executive committee* of political parties the
same rights as attach to private corporations.

FAILS TO PROBE
MURDER MYSTERY
Nevada County's : Grand
Jury Returns No
Indictments.
Is Not Quite Certain -That
Joseph Griffith's; Died a
Violent Death.
Special Dispatch to The Cail.
GRASS VALLEY, Dec. 18.â Nevada
County's Grand Jury has been unable to
fathom the Griffiths murder mystery; m
fact, if a portion of its report is permitted
to stand alone the jury is not even pre
pared to say that murder was committed.
After more than a week spent in investi
gation the Grand Jury ended its labors
to-day without having brought in a true
bill against any one in connection with
the crime.
Grittitns' body was found at the bottom
of an abandoned mine shaft months after
he had disappeared from his home in this
city. The snatt was a few feet back of
tne house of Charles Allen, and the dis
covery of the body was due to informa
tion given for a monetary consideration
by a relative of Allen. About the time
or the bndmg of tiie remains Auen's wife
disappeared. She was captured a few.
days ago in San Jose, and said in inter
views in that city that her husband and
Urimths had been rivals for the love of
another woman and that she had feared
trouble between the two men. Sheriff
Getchell, while in San Jose to bring Mrs.
Allen back to this city, declared that the
two sons of Allen had given testimony
strongly implicating their father.
If there was not sufficient evidence
upon which to base an indictment upon a
murder charge, it was believed that the
Grand Jury would at least cause several
persons to answer for perjury and for
withholding testimony at the time of the
Griffiths inquest. This the investigating
body has not done, and it has passed up
to the Governor of the State the task of
unraveling the mystery.
Despite the fact that Griffiths' body
was found hidden under a pile of refuse
at the bottom of a mine shaft, and that
during the autopsy a bullet was found in
the body, the jury's report contains this
remarkable paragraph:
We are unable to find a true bill, for the
reason that 'it is impossible to determine as a
fact that a crime has been committed.
Further along in the report this contra
dictory statement is made:
Nevertheless, under the suspicious circum
stances surrounding the disappearance of Grif
fiths and the finding: qf ' the body, we, the
Grand Jury, believe that a murder has â¢ been
committed, and therefore recommend that the
Governor of this State and the Supervisors of
Nevada County offer appropriate rewards for
the arrest and conviction of the murderers of
said Griffiths.
The meeting in question was duly called by the
proper officers and the legal officers were in
attendance when the meeting was called to
order. For a majority to leave the hall with
the records, go to another place and hold an
independent meeting at which the books are
mutilated, is clearly a violation of the rights
of the" other members of the committee who
opposed such a radical proceeding. These
rights will be maintained at any cost. We
contend that the law is on our side, and for
that reason we will take the matter into court
as speedily as possible. I was not in sym
pathy with the movement to secure a warrant
for Aubertlne's arrest for unlawful conversion
of property and the failure of Ryan and Lane
to secure a warrant did not surprise me. There
is another way for the dissenting members of
the committee to secure their rights and it will
be adopted to-day. . . . .
Mayor-Elect Is Satisfied.
â¢Mayor-elect Schmltz expresses -himself
as, .being well pleased with the coup d'etat
of^Tuesday evening, and with the remain
ing members of the committee he laughs
at the efforts' of the Buckley faction to
regain their alleged rights. In speaking
of the affair last night he said: .
I heard several days ago that Buckley In
tended to capture the committee and make the
Union Labor party a tail to his awakened po
litical aspirations. I went ' to the meeting
Tuesday evening with one purpose in my mind,
namely, to reconcile the warring factions, if
that were possible. Chairman Delaney's rul
ings convinced me that there was no hope of
bringing about the desired reconciliation, and
when he decided a certain motion carried when
in fact seventeen voted against it to seven in
favor I decided to take a hand in the proceed
ings. I then requested all who favored ..fair
play and harmony to follow me and we ad
journed to another hali across the street and
reorganized the committee. That's the story
In a nutshell. â¢
I have no fear of the results of the suit to
be filed by the dissatisfied minority, or rather,
the Buckley contingent in the committee.
When the seventeen â¢ left the hall .there was
no quorum with which to transact business.
The contention that our act was illegal can
not in my Judgment be sustained in court. It
will, be hard to overcome the principle that
the majority rules at all times in all assem
blies. Had the Buckley contingent a quorum
left after the majority adjourned to another
place the legal aspect of the situation might
be different. As it is we are on the right side,
and that being the case the future of the
Union Labor party is assured.
The refusal of the Mayor-elect to pledge
himself to appoint certain members of
the Buckley , wing to fat offices on -the
various commissions is primarily respon
sible for the troubles in the committee.
Delaney, the deposed chairman, has been'
making a strong fight for a place on the
Board of Fire Commissioners, but Mayor
elect Schmitz refused to make any prom
ises to that end, and this accounts for
Delaney's attitude toward the Parry con
tingent. â  It is said seventeen applications
for six offices 'have been filed with the
Mayor-elect, most of these.belng by mem
bers of the executive committee of thi
Union Labor party. Schmitz has posi
tively announced that he will favor all
parties in making appointments, and that
no party will be in a position to say that
it owns him absolutely when it comes to
niling the vacancies on the municipal
boards after he assumes the discharge of
his official functions.
District Club Indorses Parry.
â¢At a special meeting of the Twenty
eighth District Union Labor Club held
last night at the Packers' and Porters'
headquarters. 142*4 First street, the fol
lowing resolutions were adopted:
Whereas, There being some misunderstand
ing between some of the members of the
County Committee, which we regret and de
plore; and whereas, J. S. Parry and the com
mittee of which he la chairman, having worked
faithfully and honestly for the "success of the
Union Labor party, and as we desire harmony
in the party, we hppe all of the members of
the committee will return to the original com
mittee and peace be restored; and be it
Resolved. That we, the members of â¢ the
Twenty-eighth District Union Labor Club, do
indorse and recognize J. S. Parry 'as the chair
man of the" County Committee of the Union
Labor party, and as such we will receive his
instructions; and further be it â¢
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions
be sent to the County Committee and to thÂ«

COURT DISPUTES
WITH ATTORNEY
Repartee, Enlivens the
; ' Proceedings in
Alturas.
Lawyer Raker Meekly Dodges
Contempt Proceedings
by Apologizing.
Special Dispatch . to The Call.
ALTURAS, Dec. 18.â Proceedings In the
trial of James W^V. ' Brown, the alleged
Lookout lyncher? lacked' their usual' vim
and dash to-day, for only once did the
court find it necessary to discipline an
attorney for the defense. During the ex
amination of a witness this forenoon,
Raker, for the defense, made one of hla
characteristic orations to the jury, detail
ing something that had hot appeared in
the evidence. Judge Harrington said that
the attorney'ssword could not be taken/
as he was not under oath. ;
"My word is as good as yours any day,"
was the retort of counsel. ..
Raker was cited to show cause at 1:30
o'clock why he should not be punished
for contempt. After he and the court had
argued the point at length, he apologized..
The Judge did likewise, and the contempt
ruling was dismissed.
District Attorney Bonner has now
aligned himself squarely upon the side of
the accused men, if his attitude before
the Grand Jury may be taken as a.crite
rion. . Assistant Attorney. General â  Post,
representing the â  State, is .endeavoring to
have the Grand Jury indict other sus
pected lynchers' who ' have "' been impli
cated .by- testimony given by witnesses
for the prosecution. In this he is op
posed by Bonner, who has urged the
Grand Jury to return no more, indict
ments. . Bonner gives as an excuse for. his
course the belief that it would be impos
sible to bring about the conviction of the
accused men. :
To-day's proceedings in the trial of
Brown were limited to the cross-examina
tion of Robert Courtwright by the de
fense. Courtwright is the witness who
saw Justice of the Peace Myers and
others testing rope in a Lookout store on
the day of the . lynching. The entire day
was spent in an endeavor to entangle the
witness, enlivened now and then by at
tacks upon his character by attorneys for
the defense.
Wrongfully Accused of Theft.
SACRAMENTO, . Dec. 18.â A spiritual
istic medium styling himself as Sir Peter
Gordon, but who was known here several
years ago as Dr. Waite, when he was giv
ing hypnotic exhibitions, was arrested a
week ago on a charge of stealing $300 from
Mrs. Belle Christie, an aged woman who
sought his advice. The preliminary exam
ination of Gordon was to have taken place
in the city Justice's "court this morning.
When the case was called Mrs. Christie
took the witness stand and tearfully ex
plained that she had found the money un
der a bed, where it had fallen. Gordon
was discharged. He had been unable to
give bail and spent a week in jail.

SCHLEY FILES
HIS EXCEPTIONS
Declares Court Did Not
Consider All of the
Testimony.
WASHINGTON, Dec' 18.â Late this
afternoon, Admiral , Schley, through his
counsel, j filed with the Secretary of the
Navy his bill of exceptions to the majority
findings of the court of inquiry and also
a letter asking to be allowed to be heard
in connection with the objections to be
filed by attorneys for Admiral Sampson
to the â¢ individual opinion of Admiral
Dewey. This action was taken after Ray
nor, Teague and_Captaln Parker of coun
sel had held a "consultation throughout
the day with their client. {
Secretary Long almost immediately
after the receipt of the communication
called Judge Advocate Lemly and the
solicitor for the department, Hanna, into
conference. At its . conclusion the Secre
tary said he had no statement to make re
garding any action that he" might take In
the premises. He, however, indicated to
Teague, through the judge advocate, that
he would not hearÂ» an oral argument by
Raynorregarding Admiral Sampson's pro
test, but that he would receive a written
statement. It was expected that counsel
for Admiral Sampson would file their ob
jections to the findings of Admiral Dewey
in , the case to-day, but it is now stated
that such objections may not be j offered
before Friday.
Objects to Approval.
Schley's bill of exceptions . declares that
the applicant "objects to the approval of
the findings of the court upon the ground
that the opinion rendered and the report
of facts made by the majority of the court
are in conflict with the overwhelming
weight of evidence and that the majority
of the court, in their said opinion, have
ignored the testimony of the applicant and
of the whole of the applicant's witnesses
and all portions of the evidence given by
witnesses for the Government which was
favorable to the applicant and have thus
deprived him of rights guaranteed to him
by the laws of the land and the constitu
tion of. the United States." â  > s
Upon the grounds set . forth the,, ap
plicant "respectfully prays that approval
of the opinion of the majority of said
court of Inquiry be withheld and that said
opinion be disapproved and that he may
be afforded the opportunity to have the
testimony on record' of himself and his
witnesses properly considered and passed
upon and that the proceedings be remitted
to the court for that purpose and that he
be given such other and further relief as
he Is entitled to in the premises."
' The letter asking permission -to argue
against the protest or Admiral Sampson's
attorneys ' follows :
1 In regrard to the reported Intention of
Rear Admiral W. T. Sampson, V. S. N., by
his cotinsel, to file, with your consent, a protest
against â¢ your approval of, that portion of the
dissenting opinion of Admiral George Dewey,
US. N., to the majority of the finding of . a
court of inquiry recently held and before which
I was - the applicant. . wherein the â  question of
commandership of the American naval forces
during -the battle of Santiago Is decided In
favor of Commodore W. S. Schley, U: S. N..
and credit for the. victory won in that battle
accorded to the said Commodore Schley. I have

through my counsel oral argument against such
protest. Very respectfully, ' ' .

GARDNER IS INSTALLED FAVORITE
OVER HIS OPPONENT, KID CARTER
Boston Man's Showing With Walcott Is Apparently
Left Out of Consideration in Figuring Form on
To-Morrow Night's Fight in Mechanics' Pavilion
THE betting men have apparently
decided to omit George Gardner's
fight with Joe Walcott in figur
ing comparative form, on the fight
to-morrow night ' between the
Boston middle- weight and his old oppo
nent Kid Carter. This is indicated by
the betting, in which Gardner has been
Installed favorite at odds of 10 to tVz.
The fight Is an open looking one, as
both men have Increased in strength and
cleverness since their last meeting. Gard
ner is known to have ambitions to shine
ln the heavy-weight class, and if he can
dispose of Carter handily, as his friends
think hÂ© can, he must go up a class to get
profitable matcaes. There are few mid
dle-weights who will care for any of his
game. â 
Gardner does not underrate Carter. ThB
latter showed in their first fight that he
was game beyond .all reason. He took
an amount of punishment that would
6top a man of ordinary courage. Carter
showed the same quality in his fight with
Walcott. When he took all 'the punish
ment the latter could administer, and
that ls a great deal, and then came back
fighting It was too much for Walcott. He
allowed himself to "be counted out rather
than take any further chances with that
kind of a fighter. â¢

â  I suffered with my stomach and beck, for a'iont;
time, and after taking a 'cart-load' of medicine
Irom three doctors I grew so bad I could hardly
do a day's work. Would have death-like pains
in the side, and blind spells. I began taking
Dr. Pierre's Golden Medical Discovery and
'Pleasant Pellets.' Before I had taken half of
the second bottle I began to feel relieved. I got
six more bottles and used them, and am happy
to fay I owe my. life to Dr. Pierce."
"Accept no 'substitute for "Golden Med-
ical Discovery." There is nothing "just
as good" for diseases of the stomach,
blood and lungs.

HANLON DEFEATS
HILL CLEVERLY
Bantam- Weight Boxers
Eight Four Fierce :
Rounds.
Referee Stops the Bout to
End Unnecessary
" Punishment. -
Eddie Hanlon, defeated Joe Hill In the
gymnasium of the Bay City Athletic Club
last night after four fierce rounds of give
and-take fighting. The bout was scheduled
to go six rounds, but Hill 'was; knocked
down for the second time in the fourth
round just before the gong sounded. As
it was apparent he had no chance with
Hanlon Referee 15. J. Smith stopped the
bout to save unnecessary arid' possibly
fatal punishment.
The boys, who fought at 110 pounds,
went at it from the start. In the first
round Hill landed some hard lefts to .the
body and a right to the jaw which shook
up Hanlon. He also cut Hanlon over the
right eye, the wound bleeding profusely.
There was no let up ln the pace in the
second round, both getting busy at once.
Hanlon proved the more effective puncher
although he took considerable punishment
ln return.
In the third round the game youngsters
stood up and exchanged blow for blow.
Hill then tried repeatedly for a right
swing to the jaw, but failed to land.
Both boxers started at top speed in the
fourth, but Iranian soon* had Hill on the
ropes and in distress. He sent a shower
of rights and lefts to "the 'body and then
knocked Hill down with a left to the jaw.
Hill took nine seconds, slow count, on tiie
mat. Another left sent him down again,
when Referee Smith humanely put an end
to the bout.
The attendance was the largest ever at
tracted by minor fights. Hardly another
spectator could have been crowded Into
the gymnasium.
Proceedings were started by Dan Sulli
van and Joe Angeli, who went three fast
rounds. Sullivan's gameness was his
principal quality. He stood oft Angeli
until the latter landed some hard blows
to the body. One of these finally sent
Sullivan to the mat, where he remained
until counted out.
jockey Bonnett was given the decision
over Jack McFadden after four rounds
of fierce rough and tumble fighting. The
bell just saved McFadden at the end of
the third- round. Both boxers took a lot
of punishment and seemed on the verge
of going out several times.
Jack Coyne and Toddy Everitt stood up
for four rounds and exchanged blow for
blow. The bout went to . Everitt on
points.
Sergeant of Police Bush stopped the
fight between Robbie Johnson and Kid
Ryan, a pair of bantam-weights, in the
third round. Johnson had the better of
the bout although Ryan was a willing
fighter. . .
The bout between Charley Rochette, one
of the, "old school," and Frank George
was a combination, of boxing, wrestling
and grand and. lofty tumbling. Most of
the time it was a three-handed affair with
the referee being lugged' around the ring
by the wild swinging boxers. It went the
limit, George getting the decision.
James McDevitt refereed all except the
Hanlon-Hili fight. James Griffin was
judge.
WALCOTT DEFEATS FEBN3.
Referee Stops the Bout at the End of
Five Hounds.
BUFFALO, N. Y., Dec. 18:â Rube Ferns,
the welterweight champion, went down-to
defeat at the hands of Joe Walcott, the
Barbadbes black, in five rounds to-night
in' the arena of the International Athletic
Club at Fort Erie. Walcott battered Ferns
with terrific bodyblows and right and left
swings to the head. To save Ferns from
being completely knocked out the referee
stopped the bout and awarded the decision
to Walcott.
In the fifth and last round Walcott sent
Ferns to the boards on two occasions and
"Rube" twice took the count. When he
arose the second time he was in a weak
ened condition. The fight, while It lasted,
was the fiercest and fastest seen in the
clubhouse. -Ferns landed some terrific
blows on Walcott's stomach, but the Bos
ton fighter was in prime condition and
laughed at Ferns' efforts. Ferns began
to weaken in the third round and bis ad
mirers saw the beginning of the end.
In the fourth round both men went to
the floor in a clinch and Walcott assisted
Ferns to arise. Hardly had the two re
newed hostilities before Walcott almost
sent "Rube" through the ropes. He
crawled on his hands and knees to the
ropes and gained his feet. He fought
gamely and desperately. Walcott went at
him with vicious blows and had Ferns
almost out when the referee interfered.
The men met at 142 pounds.-.

TRAEGER WILL CAPTAIN
THE OABBINAL ELEVEN

ball Team for the Coming
Year. ,
. STANFORD UNIVERSITY, j Dec. 18.â
Isham Traegrer, '03, star tackle
lor three years on the Stanford varsity!
eleven, was unanimously chosen captain
of the football team this afternoon' by his
team-mates who played with him against
California on November 9th. He was
nominated by Left-half Hill. , .
/"Fluffy": Traeger made his initial ap
pearance on the campus gridiron as
tackle on the 1903 freshman team. From
.that time there has never been a ques
tion as to , who would occupy, the position
of left tackle on, the varsity. Assistant
Coach McMillan asserts that Traeger is
aai ideal tackle, possessing the necessary
qualities of size, strength and â  speed.
.Traeger is a student-in the law depart
ment and registers from:Portervllle.; He
combines the requisites : of a" good tackle
with the ability of an expert place-kicker,
making him one of the most valuable men
on the cardinal squad. 1 . , < v

OLD ENGLAND BEATS SAN NICHOLAS;
DRIVING, IN WORLD'S RECORD TIME
Two Crack Two-Year-pldsW
Six Straight Favorites Meet Defeat at Oakland-â St. Philippina First.
Mercer a Fast PerformerâDavid S Downs Rollick at Odds of 30 to 1
BOR the second time within five
â  days Old England, the strapping
two-year-old from Green Morris
" stable, â  stepped 'home I in front jj of
San â¢ Nicholas, at Oakland, and
still there is' a dispute as to the relative
merits of the pain The distance yesterday
was four and a half furlongs,, and Old
England covered the r$ute in the fastest
time ever made In a race by a two-year
oldâ53 secondsâ which equals the world's
record . for same, - made some years - ago
at Alexander Island by . Meadows, a six
year-old gelding; with 112 pounds in. the
saddle. - When the pair' met last Satur
day Old England beat San Nicholas ; a
neck after the latter had come on' from
ninth position at the start: Yesterday
O'Connor," on the Morris youngster, again
outbroke Spencer astride San~ Nicholas,
winning at the wire by two lengths in the
time before stated. Charley Patterson,
trainer for Burns & Waterhouse, does not
believe in the "Indian sign-'.theory appar
ently, for; after a cool fng out interval a
match race at five furlongs for $500 a side,
with. $500 to be added by the association,
was arranged, to take place on Saturday:
Under the conditions each will pick up 111
pounds, . break from a flying start, and if
necessary the recall Hag will be used. The
match has created widespread interest, as
opinion is^dlvided, and each two-year
old seems, to possess' an equal number of
admirers. . . .-.- - . . - .
It was another, calamitous inning, for
favorites at the track over the bay, all
six being: snugly tucked away to sleep.
Mercer, a stranger, came bouncing in at
5 to 1, Herculean at 6; Icicle beat Fitz
kanet, and in the afterpiece David S, over
looked almost entirely, won driving from
Rollick, with 30 to 1 about him in the ring.
Easy Victory for St. Phillipina.
After receding to 5 to 1 in the betting
on the opening two-year-old sprint, St.
Phillipina made a. runaway race of it.
Baldo, a Balgowan gelding owned by Bar
ney Schreiber, and on which thero was a
steady play, finished second, In front of
Senator Bruce. Bendara, which was In
stalled favorite, evidently shines best in
muddy going, for he cut no figure In the"
running. . '
Although freely, circulated that Mercer
had negotiated a mile in 1:40% it was the
Eastern horse's first attempt,- so the' ring
laid 5 to 1 about him in the betting on
the six furlong selling dash. On local
form Dangerous Maid had first call at 7
to 5. The latter mare did not have very
clear sailing and after finally getting to
the front in the stretch was collared and
beaten with ease by Mercer, brought from
behind by little Redfern and eased up in
1:12%.
1 Bullman on Herculean, a C to 1 shot, got
the decision from (he favorite, Ltzzella,
piloted by O'Connor, at the conclusion of
the mile and a sixteenth run. Rio Shan
non made the running to the stretch and
then gave it up to Herculean. Lizzella
was away poorly and had to come from
a long way back or she would have
scored. Wyoming was left. â¢
Icicle, with Buchanan on his back, sent
a cold chill creeping over the talent by
his easy/ win of the mile purse. P. Ryan
finally got his Hanover maiden three
year-old thawed j *out and he simply
spreadeagled his field, covering the dis
tance In 1:4OV4.' Redfern on Fitzkanet hart
to tramp: the. overland route..from.last
position, beating Dunblane for the place.
Quoted a mild 11 to 5 favorite. Rollick,
with considerable bad luck at the start,
could not make. uj*. the lost ground and
lost. to David S by half a length. The lat
ter'horse enjoyedTclear sailing from, the
start and Lee Jackson kept him at It
from the kick-off. ~>Bab ran a good third.'
Track "Notes.
Nineteen books cut in â yesterday and
there was business enough'. to keep every
body jumping. Apparently the sport was
never in a more flourishing condition.
Tommy Burns, dapper as ever and at
tired in * the latest English trousering,
made his first appearance . on Wyoming,
and it was an unfortunate one. He re
ceived a very cordial reception from the
crowd,. Taut old Wyoming refused to break
and was left at the post.
â¢ If Ed Lanigan's filly St. Phillipina re
tains her present form she will take some
beatlns from now on. -
There will be no change of riders ln the
match race on Saturday, O'Connor pilot
ing Old England and Spencer San Nich
olas. . i â¢
Winnie O'Connor had a close call from
a fall in the last race. Near the three
sixteenths pole Afghan, under punish
ment, swerved in toward the rail, knock
ing O'Connor's mount, Redwald. to his
knees. McGinn rode Afghan and it looked
entirely unavoidable.
The paternal parent ol O'Connor objects
to his son donning the gloves ln public
and it Is Just probable that Winnie's
â scorning bout with Crow will be declared
off. '
Owen Mounco was suffering from an
abscess in the ear and did not ride yester
day. ,
\ "Dell" Fountain, the owner of Doublet
and Position, undoubtedly holds the rec
ord for beating long shots. He was re
ported as winning $3000 on David S.

IN HIS FIANCEE
Tells Miss Holman of His
Hope to Signal Over
the Ocean.
Marriage of Wireless -Expert
Postponed Until Experi
ments Are Concluded.
Special DisDatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 18.â Miss Joseph
ine Holman, who is engaged to marry Sig
nor Marconi, has announced to friends
that her marriage will not take place as
SÂ« rly as expected for the reason that Mar
coni is now concentrating all his thoughts
<m his work and it would be impossible
ior him to come here at this time. It was
mutually agreed between them, she says,
that their marriage ought not to take
place until the experiments reached a
point where he could afford to relax his
efforts at least for a time. Miss Holman
â was the first person to wnom Signor Mar
coni confided his hopes and ambitions in
the line of wireless telegraphy across the
ocean. It was on board ship when he was
coming to this country to establish a sta
tion in Newfoundland that he told her of
his work and what he hoped for. ;
Experiments by the Navy.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET N. W.,
â¢WASHINGTON. D. C. Dec. IS.â Wireless
telegTaphy experiments, which are expect
ed to result in the adoption of a system
for the United States navy, will shortly
begin under the auspices of the Navy De
partment.
Two stations are being established, one
si the Washington navy yard and the
other at Annapolis, Md.
Several systems, including the Marconi,
â will be tried in competition. Rear Admiral
Bradford has been anxious for some time
that a test should be had of the various
systems, to determine which is the best
for naval purposes. Commercial experi
ence has demonstrated that Signor Mar
coni has made thÂ© greatest advance, but
xhere are problems still to be solved, and
an effort will be made in the forthcoming
naval experiments to facilitate their solu
tion. The tests will be supervised by a
Tpard of which Lieutenant Commander
\V. S. Gogg and Lieutenant A. M. Beecher
â will be members.
Professor Bell's Offer.
ST. JOHNS, N. F. t Dec. 18.â The London
Daily Mail wired to Marconi to-day asking
if his future tests would be with the sig
nals, letter "S," or with messages. He re
plied, "With messages."
Among the letters received by Marconi
-was the following one from Professor
Alexander Graham Bell, at Washington:
â¢"Co.Tgratulations and best wishes. If you
can make use of my estate in Cape Breton,
rear Baddeck, as a temporary station, you
are welcome to it, and my manager, Mr.
Mclnnes, will be glad to care for you and
your party and do everything possible to
facilitate your experiments."
Marconi feels very grateful for Profes
sor Bells kind offer and is making inqui
ries regarding the suitability of Baddeck
for experimental purposes.
Marconi still holds his Intention to leave
for Canada Sunday. His assistants are
packing up the wireless apparatus.

It was at the Union League exhibit in
New York that the California artist won
a national fame and he is reaping the
fruits thereof even in the far West.
Joullin' exhibited twenty-two pictures

the eye of the critic as well as the pub
lic. Indian subjects, all of them, they at
tracted a general attention which result
ed well for the artist both financially and
in the matter of reputation. The "End

were the two canvases 'which | received
the greatest commendation. He brought
them with him and they are now hang

FUTURE BRIGHT
FOR FILIPINOS
United States Commis
sion Reports on a
Year's Work.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.â Provision for
a permanent civil government and much
important legislation regarding the indus
trial development of the Philippines is
embodied in the annual report of the Phil
ippine Commission. It is declared that the
Federal partly spread like wildfire
throughout the archipelago and that there
are few towns in any of the provinces
which have not their Federal committees.
The members of the party were the most
active and effective in inducing insurgent
leaders to surrender. It Is declared by uie
commission that:
Outside of the five provinces named (Batan
gas, Cebu, Bohol, Sainar and Mlndoro) there
Is peace In the remainder of the archipelago.
All lnsurrectos have surrendered and in most
or the provinces except among the Luke Moros
It Is entirely safe during the day for travelers
unattended to go from one town to another.
In the other provinces recent war conditions
and suffering and hardship from cattle pest
and locusts have developed ladronism. The
people are friendly to the civil Government
and manifest no desire whatever for a,continu
ance of the- war, but only a desire for peace
and protection. . ...
Taking up the question of the political
future of the Filipinos, it is declared that
the theory upon which the commission is
proceeding is that the only possible means
of instructing the Filipino people In meth
ods cf free institutions and self-govern
ment is to make a Government partly of
Americans and partly of Filipinos, with
ultimate control in American hands for
some time to come. Less than 10 per cent
of the people speak Spanish, and the edu
cated people, under the influence of the
Spanish teaching, have but a faint concep
tion of real civil liberty and the mutual
self-restraints required for its mainten
ance.
The commission has already, however,
established municipal suffrage in the paci
fied parts of the islands and limited the
suffrage to those who can read and write
English or Spanish, or who own property
to the value of $250, pay an annual tax of
$15 or have been municipal officers. Thus
far only 49,523 electors have qualified under
these provisions, out of a population of
2,695,801, in 350 municipalities, showing only
18.37 electors per 1000 inhabitants. This is
only about 10 per cent of the number
which would qualify with similar popula
tion,under American law.
â The commission outlines- a project
which, in brief, contemplates the contin
uance for two years of the existing pow
ers of the commission. Then a represen
tative, government is^to be formed, com
posed of a Civil Governor, a legislative
council and a popular assembly, the pow
ers of. the latter being closely limited bo
as to prevent It from choking the gov
ernment in making the budget, in fits- of
passion or through inexperience. The
President of the United States would, of
course, reserve absolute veto power. The
Filipinos should also have the right to be
represented before Congress and the ex
ecutive government at Washington by
two delegates.
The commission proposes to settle ' the
vexed question of land titles by legislation
providing for the sale of public lands up
on the homestead principle and the pay
ment through a bond issue of the price
of the lands now held by the religious
orders. A 50 per cent reduction in the
tariff on Philippine imports into the
United States would*'. it is said, increase

ments.
1 BERLIN, Dec. 18.â An interesting ar
ticle has appeared in the Kreuz Zeitung,
which, although it cannot be called even
a semi-official newspaper, sometimes re
flects Government views. The article
dwells on the alleged probability of Amer
ican intervention in South Africa, remarks
that President Roosevelt Is not in har
mony with. the bulk of public sentiment
and adds: -
"Americans must remember-that In 17S3
the Union would not 'have been possible
except through foreign Intervention. If
there are far-seeing statesmen in America
it must be hoped that they soon will see
that they are under a high moral obliga
tion to Intervene In South Africa and that
they are strong enough to do so effect
ively.!'
The article goes on to say that the
United States occupies a unique posi
tion, being without powerful . military ri
vals across her border: that she would
need only to give orders to march on
Canada to bring Great Britain to terms
arid if she took s,uch a step she would win

President Announces De

Special Disnatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
.W.,' WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.â Internal
Revenue . Collector J. C. Lynch of the
First District j of j California will not be
removed. . The matter was decided to-day
by President Roosevelt, who informed
Senator Bard that, Senator Perkins had
protested againet Lynch's removal, and
as long as the senior Senator maintained
that attitude no action would be taken.
Senator Bard had an interview with the
President by appointment this morning.
Bard was accompanied by State Senator
Belshaw; of California, a college mate of
the President. They laid the matter be
fore the President, Bard urging the re
moval of Lynch because of the "perni
cious activity" of the Collector in poll
tics, State and national. Bard was pre
pared further and more fully to present
what -.he believed to be just causes for
Lynch's removal, but was met with th3
prompt' declaration of the President that
Senator Perkins' protest against the step
urged by Senator Bard would prevent any
action in the matter, and that Lynch
would be retained.
, Senator : Bard told thÂ£ President that
while he regretted -deeply his refusal to
depose Lynch, whose removal the Senator
regarded as demanded by the best inter
ests of the public service, he must accept
and abide by. his decision. Senator Bard
later expressed his disappointment at the
attitude of the President, who, he be
lieves, has not fully realized the real
character and significance of the opposi
tion to Lynch's removal, but has rested
solely on the senior Senator's protest re
gardless of- the merits of the question.
, A bit of humor was added to this rather
serious and embarrassing case to-day by
Senator Perkins, who was at the White
House, -to Introduce William M. Bunker
to the President. Mr. Roosevelt told Sen
ator Perkins that he and Bard ought. to
"get together" on the Lynch matter,
whereupon Perkins said to the President
that he (the Senator)-, was chairman of
the Senate Committee on Civil Service
Reform and therefore could not consist
ently recommend the removal of an efil
cient public servant. Senator Perkins'
tender regard for civil service reform ap
pealed at once to the President's sense of
humor and the conversation drifted â  to
other matters. 'â '.'/

suggestions that a division of sentiment
existed on the subject, Kahn declared that
the mercantile community of San Fran

a recent test vote by the Merchants' Asso

CLAIMS LEAVE
IS IRREGULAR
Webster Asks Informa
tion as to Babcock's.
"Vacation.
Superintendent of Schools Webster will
to-morrow begin an investigation into an
alleged irregular leave of absence granted
by President Kihcaid of the Board of Ed
ucation to Madison Babcock, vice-princi
pal of the Fairmount Grammar school,
Webster will request information from
the I board at its meeting as to the au
thority under which Babcock has absent
ed himself from his duties. This will
be a preliminary into an inquiry which
Webster will pursue regarding the al
leged Inefficiency of Babcock as a
6 Webster contends that Babcock has
never been granted regular leave as the
rules of the board provide. It appears
that Babcock visited Mrs. Kincaid some
three weeks ago and on his informing her
that he was a sick man she told him to
go away for a rest and not come back un
til his health had been restored. The
rules' grant the president of the board
such authority, but Webster says that it
is the president's duty to report her ac
tion at the next meeting of the. board.
The rule on the subject provides that "the
president may act for the board in the
Interim of meetings, but must report all
such action to the board at its next meet
ing for ratification.". This, Webster says,
has never been done and the records bear
him out. Webster is at a loss to know
why Babcock should be treated with so
much consideration when other teachers
are held strictly to the letter of the regu
lations when requesting absence leave.
The verbal report of Miss C. F. Thomp
son, principal of the Fairmount school,
that Babcock is inefficient both as a dis
ciplinarian and teacher, has been corrob
orated in a measure by the investigations
of Deputies Howard and Kingsbury.
They were only able to find Babcock at
his desk one day and they report that his
methods were somewhat erratic. Web
ster is disinclined to subject Babcock to
the ordeal of a trial until additional In
quiries have been made. The Superin
tendent, however, will insist on Babcock
being granted leave in the regular way
and when the vice-principal returns to his
duties he may experience some difficulty
in proving that he is a competent teacher.

JAMES DUNPHY
SET AT LIBERTY
Jury Finds That Killing
of Edward Stanton
Was Justifiable.
James M. Dunphy, who shot and killed
Edward Stanton at Minna and Mary
streets on the evening of September 27,
was acquitted yesterday afternoon by a
jury in Judge Cook's court.
When the court convened yesterday
morning Judge Cook delivered his charge
to the jurors and they retired to deliber
ate upon a verdict. As they had not ar
rived at an agreement at the noon hour
a recess was taken till 2 o'clock so that
they could partake of lunch. They re
turned to court at 2 o'clock and fifteen
minutes later announced that they had
agreed.
Every eye in the courtroom was fixed
upon the jurors as they slowly filed into
the courtroom and took their seats.
Courtroom Clerk Tolle asked if they had
agreed upon a verdict and the foreman,
J. H. Dooley, answered. "We, the jury,
find the defendant not guilty of the
charge of murder."
There were cheers and clapping of
hands In -the courtroom when the verdict
was announced, but the demonstration
was quickly suppressed by Judge Cook,
who ordered Bailiff Windrow to bring the
disturbers before him.
A painful silence followed and Windrow
looked to where the noise was greatest,
but he could not positively select any one
In particular.
"My attention." said the Judge, "was
not directed to the- disturbance at the mo
ment and I have to depend upon the offi
cers of the court. I would teach them a
severe lesson for making such a demon
stration in a court of justice if I wa3 cer
tain of any of them. The noise was most
unseemly."
When the jury was discharged Dun
phy's mother, who was seated beside him.
threw her arms round his neck and wept
while friends crowded round to congrat
ulate him.

were: J. M. Merrill. J. E. Dealey, J. W.

THE CUBAN ELECTIONS.
/- > ECRETARY ROOT has emphatically and
somewhat sharply informed the representatives
of the Maso party in Cuba that this Govern
ment will not accede to their request to postpone the
CubÂ£n elections. He declines to interfere in any
way, and the Cubans must go forward at once with
the work of organizing their government and putting
it into practical operation.
The plea for interference was based upon the
charge that the central board of scrutiny, which will
have the task of determining the results of the elec
tions, is composed of men all of whom are friends
and supporters of General Palma, leaving the Maso
party without a single representative on the board.
On the face of it the plea appears f a valid one. It has
ever been the custom in this country that both the
two great parties into which the people are' divided
should be represented on election boards from the
lowest to the highest, and the principle that under
lies the practice here is equally applicable to Cuba.
It happens, however, that in this particular instance
the rule of equal representation could not be enforced
without entailing consequences more evil than that
of leaving'the board of scrutiny as it is, and accord
ingly the ruling of the Secretary is as justifiable in
principle as in expediency.
The central board of scrutiny was appointed be
fore the Cubans had divided themselves into their
present political alignments* and before any candi
dates were nominated. It was therefore impossible
to apportion its membership on party lines. It stands
as a strictly non-partisan board, so far as its.organi
zation goes, and if the chances of politics are such
as to have brought it about that all of them are
aligned in the party of Palma t.hat is something the
United States officials could not have foreseen and
cannot be expected to interfere with.
The Cuban elections are arranged to extend over
a considerable period. In the latter, part of this
month there will be elections to choose the Govern
ors of provinces, later on there will be elections of
members to the Provincial Assemblies, still later
Deputies to the National House will be" chosen;
next in order the election of Senators will take place,
and it will not be until February that the Presiden
tial-election occurs. Cuba, therefore, is going to
have an election winter and something like a con
tinuous campaign. Should our Government begin at
this time to interfere, it might have to continue in
terfering at each one of the Â«. succeeding , elections.
â¢That, of course, is something we wish to avoid.
Cuba is to be self-governing, and the time for her
to begin such government is right now.
The request for interference is the more strange
because it comes from the party which has made
"Cuba for the Cuban"' a campaign cry, and which op
poses General Palma because he is regarded as too
friendly to the United States. Secretary Root made
a good point upon that fact by closing his reply to
the representative of General Maso with the state
ment: "I cannot avoid the conviction that your re
quest calls upon the United States for the very in
terference with the Cuban elections which your asso
ciates have deprecated and which it is our duty and
our purpose to avoid."
The Kaiser's latest enterprise is that of spelling
reform. He insists that the spelling of "Koln" shall
be changed to "Coin," and "Krefeld" to "Crefeld."
As the new spelling would be a change from the old
German method the advocacy of it is something of
a novelty in the Kaiser, who has in other things been
decidedly medieval in his tendencies, and for once
Wilhelm has managed to surprise- folks.
All the bird lovers. in Great Britain are' raging be

THE REAL: WATER PROBLEE
SAN FRANCISCO emerges from the con
. troversy over the use of Point Lobos Creek as
,~a source of water supply ' only to confront a
more important problem. It is fairly certain the
Spring Valley Water Company resorted to that creek
mainly because it could not, obtain from -its other
sources of supply a. quantity of water adequate to the
demand at all seasons of the year. The real ques
tion before the city, therefore, is not one of prevent
ing the use of water drawn from contaminated water
sheds, but of providing a source of water supply
which shall be not only pure but abundant.
The Spring Valley Water Company has evidently
reached the limit of its present resources. The water
taken from Point Lobos Creek has been condemned,
and it. will be but a comparatively short time when
the supply drawn from Lake Merced must be con
demned also, for the settlement of the population is
extending in that direction. In fact, it is only a
question of time when no part of the peninsula will
be free enough. from human habitation and the re
sulting refuse for its springs and streams to furnish
water fit for household purposes. . V
Even, however, were there no question of the pur-*
ity of the waters of Lobos Creek or of Lake Merced,'
there would still remain the important fact that the
whole supply of the Spring Valley Company is in
adequate to the needs of the increasing population of
the city. We do not feel with any acuteness the need
of more water just now, but we would be foolish
should we postpone any steps toward obtaining , a
larger supply until the need is felt acutely. A water
system for a city of the size of San Francisco is not
to be provided in a. day nor in a year. If we make
no move to obtain abundant water until we actually
require the water for daily needs we shall . have a
long period of suffering in many ways, accompanied
by municipal stagnation.
One of the noted features of the development of
modern civilization has been the increased use of
water by individuals, by families and by communities
as a whole. Cities that have not an abundant, pure
and cheap water supply soon become noted and are
shunned. Njothing is more attractive to the home
seeker and to the settler than the assurance that the
water supply of the community in which he thinks of
settling is at once healthful and ample. There -are
cities which owe much of their success to the fact
that they have such ample water, supplies, and there
are others whose ill-success is due to the lack of
them. We are therefore confronting an issue which
even at this time is of prime importance, notwith
standing the fact that it is not felt as a matter of
urgency by the general mass of the people,
It is right and fitting the proper authorities should
see to it that no impure water is served to any por
tion of the city, and that water" rates be ,not exces
sive, but none the less those things must now be re
garded as minor matters in the problem. We should
at once dismiss as far as possible all the old conten
tions between the city and the Spring Valley Com 1
pany and go forward to the new work that awaits
us â that of providing the community with a. source
of water supply far larger, better and more certain
at all seasons than the Spring Valley Company can
furnish.
With the extension of electric roads the whole
southern sweep of San Francisco Bay will be girdled
by a continuous suburban settlement, having San
Francisco and Oakland' for its extremities and San
Jose as its central point. There will then be a de
mand for a water supply throughout the whole of
that region. The population will be large and the de
mand for water will be enormous when measured
by the present demand. For that supply we must be
gin to prepare now. If it be undertaken in time it
can be carried out economically after a well devised
plan. If we wait until the actual urgency come we
shall have an unavoidable waste of money. That,
then, is the chief and prime point in all water ques
tions that arise in San Francisco. We must prepare
for the future. N

WALL STREET'S COPPER FIGHT.
WHETHER the public will ever learn all the
inside history of the struggle over copper
. stocks in Wall street may be doubted. The
astute men who manipulate the deals that bring
about such* struggles are never sufficiently angry with
one another to tell all they know. The saying
"When thieves fall out hone'st men. get their dues"
was originated at a time when, thieves 'were men of
limited intellect and uncontrollable passions. The :
highly scientific exploiter of other men's pockets
through stock deals knows very well that his oppo
nent in the street to-day may be his friendâ or at
least his ally â to-morrow, and consequently he does
not expose all the iniquity of his opponent's action.
By reason of that wise reticence the public gets but
faint glimpses of, the inner working of such schemes
as that which has recently led to losses, ruin and de
falcations in all parts of the country.
In the absence of full light on the subject we must
be content with such light as we can get and make
the best use of it. It. is therefore worth noting that
T. W. Lawson, whose position during the whole
fight has been so conspicuous, has issued a personal
statement to the holders of Amalgamated stock ex
plaining the situation from his point of view and jus
tifying himself from the attacks made upon him..
His statement is interesting, no matter to what ex
tent it may be colored by his personal prejudices and"
interests, and while it would not be wise, perhaps/for
any one to act upon it to the extent of speculating
in copper stocks, yet in the absence of any authori
tative refutation from a source equally reliable it
furnishes about, the best information we have con
cerning the deal.
Briefly stated, Mr. Lawson's explanation is that the
slaughtering of copper stock in the street was done
for no other purpose than that of- frightening small
stockholders into selling their stock and â  enabling
the schemers to buy it at a low price. Along with
the stocks of the small holders the schemers also
hoped to get possession of those of the , Daly "estate
and of Mr. Lawson. .Of the result of the 'scheme tip
to the date when his statement was published (De
cember 12) Mr. Lawson says: "The campaign has >
been largely successful. Many investors have been
slaughtered, certain heavy speculators also, and the
Daly holdings have been secured. Mine have not."
"Perhaps the most important feature of the state-"
merit is the assertion that the depression in' the stocks'
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; THURSDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1901.
was caused largely by what Mr. Lawson calls
"journals whose editors', names are generally found
upon the .formation of new corporations in the Â« list
of 'stock allotted, not tobe paid for; profit guaran
teed.' " .-"'. These' journals, it is said, have been busy
informing the public that "the Amalgamated and
copper trouble is all and entirely the outcome of the
natural conditions of the metal trade. The condi
tions of the metal market are responsible for every
thing, and they only are responsible." Mn ' Lawson
declares such statements to be false and misleading.,
He asserts: i "The -cause of the recent drop in the
price of Amalgamated was it was held by thousands
of investors throughout America and 'Europe, and a
campaign was planned to slaughter those investors."
The Call cannot undertake to decide between the
contending parties,- but the moral should not be
overlooked by any one. He who speculates in Wall
street goes it blind. A man might just- as well buy
gold bricks of the first bunko man who comes his
way. ' The effects of thfc copper, deal, have been felt
disastrously all. over the United States. Even Cali
fornia's; distance from: the scene of the excitement
has not saved some of our people from its influence.
There as~ now hiding from justice a once highly re
spected bank cashier of Los Angeles whose downfall
is' attributed by, his friends to speculations in copper.
.Wall: street is a healthy locality if you'keep out of it.
After all it may be that. we must look to Italy for
the elevation of the stage. It is said that at the re
cent first night performance of d'Annunzio's drama,
"Francesca da Rimini," at Rome, the audience di
vided itself into two factions; there were storms of
hisses* and thunders of applause. Every scene was
taken seriously, and the close of the play was fol
lowed by about an equal number -of duels and ban
quets. The town of Rimini conferred its freedom
upon the author and' sent, a magnificent wreath to
Signora Duse, who played the part of the heroine.
In short, there was everywhere a manifestation that
the Italian people look upon the drama as something
more than a mere amusement, and sanguine critics
prophesy a new renaissance for dramatic art.
WHEN submitting to the Senate the report
of the Committee on Manufactures con
cerning the pure food laws of the different
States of the Union and of various foreign countries,
Senator Mason made a brief statement of the bene
ficial effects of such hiws, and as an illustration cited
the results obtained by the law designed to put a
stop to the. adulteration of flour. The success at
tained, by : that act, he argued, is sufficient to justify
further legislation in the same direction and to en
courage Congress to undertake a comprehensive
scheme of pure food legislation.*
At the beginning of its investigations into the
practice of food adulterations the committee found
that fully 6o per cent of the flour used in this coun
try was adulterated. Wheat flour was mixed â  with
finely ground; white corn, with a by-product of glu
cose factories known as "corn flour," which consists
of the remnant of corn after all the sugar and gluten
have been taken out, leaving nothing but the husks,
and with a species of white earth known as terra alba,
or mineraline.
The first two adulterants are not deleterious in
their nature and the wrong done to the consumer
is simply that . of foisting upon ! liim an inferior ar
ticle in place of the genuine -flour he desires and pays
for. Even in that light, however, the'evil is a serious
one. Senator Mason states that as much as 25 or 30
per cent of worthless by-product of the glucose fac
tories was mixed with flour, and that at the time the
investigation was. made "more than half of all. the
mills in the United States had what is commonly
known as a mixer." The mineraline adulterant is
absolutely pernicious, but it seems it was never used
to form any considerable percentage of ' the whole
mixture, sold as pure flour.
The flour trade was in that condition when Con
gress amended the Dingley tariff by placing a tax
upon mixed flour. The tax was not designed to
raise a revenue so much as to give the Federal Gov-
ernment authority to inspect flours and collect the
tax, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the
law, and Senator Mascn says: "During the first
twelve months after the passage of the law about
12,000 barrels ? of mixed flour containing terra alba
were confiscated. The mills that were used in grind
ing itMiave been dosed â they are absolutely out of
business." '
The results of the law as revealed in the export'
trade of the country strikingly attest, the value of
pure food .regulations. After governmental super-
vision of r flour was 'put into force the export trade
increased from 10,000,000 barrels of flour to 15,000,000
barrels in twelve months. : >- '-*;.';â :
Commenting upon ; the increase the Senator went
on to say: "I have here a printed letter from ihe
leading merchants in flour in fifteen of the largest
cities of the world, including London, Bremen,
Glasgow, Liverpool, 'Amsterdam, ' Antwerp, Ham
burg, and so on, stating that immediately after the
passage of what is known as the American pure food
bill the demand for American flour increased. While
I do not claim that the large increase of 50 per' cent
is due wholly to the fact that we guaranteed the pur
ity of the flour, yet I do believe, and it is generally
believed by the manufacturers of the country, that a
very large' share of the increase is due to that
cause." j â 
In taking flour as an illustration of the advantages
to be gained from a governmental supervision, Sen
ator Mason did not overlook the importance of ap
plying a. similar, protection to other classes of food.
"We found adulterations," he said, "in the' spices
that go on the table, the. syrups, the jellies, the jams,
the pickles, and ten thousand kinds of foods." Gov
ernmental supervision in such matters has the triple
benefit of protecting the consumer against adultera
tions more or less harmful, the ' honest manufacturer
against the dishonest competitor, and increasing .the
demand for our 'products abroad. It* would' seem,
then, that the^ precedent established in the flour law
might be, profitably followed in/dealing with other
staple articles of food or drink.

PURE POOD LAWS.
LEGISLATORS OE THE NATION DECIDE
ON A PHILIPPINE LAW.
House Passes
Revenue Bill
For Islands
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.â The bill
to provide revenue temporarily
for the Philippine Islands . pass-'
I ed the House to-day by a vote
of 163 to 128. Five Republicans
â McCall of Massachusetts, Littlefield of
Maine, Heatwole, Eddy and ; Stevens of
Minnesotaâ voted with the Democrats
against the bill, and three Democrats-
Robertson, Davey and Broussard of
Louisianaâ voted with the Republicans
for it. Meyer (D.) of Louisiana was
paired , in favor of the bin with Foster,
an Illionis Democrat, who voted against
the Porto Rican bill in the last Congress,
and voted for tne Philippine measure to
day.' Crumpacker of Indiana, who also
voted against the Porto Rican ? bill, - was
absent.
In the course of the debate to-day the
Democrats were several "times taunted
with their failure to present an alterna
tive proposition for* the pending meas
ure, but just before. the vote -v^as taken
on the passage of the bill the attitude, of
the minority was denned in a motion to
recommit, offered by Richardson, the mi
nority leader. N It instruqted the Ways and
Means Committee to report the bill back
amended so. as to reduce the customs and
internal revenue laws of the United
States to a revenue basis and to extend
them to the Philippines until the latter,
with the aid of the United States, should
be able to set up a stable, independent
government. %
'*â ;&â ; Participant's in the Debate.
This proposition did not command a
Republican vote, and the three Louisiana
Democrats abo've mentioned voted against
it. Meyer of Louisiana was paired against
it. The speakers to-day were Hepburn
of Iowa and Dalzell of Pennsylvania for
the bill and , Henry of Texas, Williams of
Mississippi, McCall (R.) of Massachusetts,
Green of Pennsylvania and McClellan of
New York against it.
The bill passed to-day imposes the
Dingley tariff on goods entering the
United States from the Philippines and
the rates established by the Philippine
Commission on goods entering the Philip
pines from the United States. It also
provides for the collection \ of tonnage
taxes on vessels plying between the
United States and the Philippines, and
that foreign vessels may ply between
these ports until January 1, 1905. The du
ties and taxes collected under the pro
visions of the bill shall go into the Phil
ippine treasury, to be expended for the
use and benellt of the islands.
The attendance in the galleries did not
indicate much public interest in the de
bate. Henry of Texas was the first
speaker. He characterized the bill as op
pressive and o'utrageous. Hepburn of
Iowa charged that the reason the opposi
tion gave unanimous consent for a vote
on the bill without opportunity to offer
amendments was because they did not
wish to present their propositions in con
crete form, and "be content to talk and
afraid to act."
.Hepburn said he believed the policy of
the bill was right. He did not believe
the Filipinos .were capable of self-govern
ment.
: "Do you not believe, they are as capable
of self-government as the Cubans? 1 ' in
quired Shafroth, of Colorado. , ;
: "I do." â¢. >
.'"Then, do you not believe in the in
dependence of Cuba?"
"The Democratic party, forced the ad
ministration into a position where it was
compelled against its will to declare for
the independence of Cuba," replied Hep
burn, amidst Democratic applause.'
"Oh, you may applaud," he continued,
"but I predict that before many years you
will yours-ejves see the unwisdom of giv
ing the Cubans independence."
The debate was closed by Dalzsll of
Pennsylvania in a speech of an hour. He
drew a parallel between the government
of the Louisiana Territory immediately
after its acquisition and the government
of the Philippines, to show that the latter
was less arbitrary and despotic than the
former.
"This measure purports to be a revenue
bill;" interrupted McDermott of New Jer
sey. "Can he cite any act which imposed
a duty on goods from one Territory or
State to another?"
Dalzell Starts a Laugh.
"Certainly,", replied Dalzell. "If the
gentleman will examine history he will
find that duties v;ero levied for a long
time on goods from the Territory of Lou
isiana and- also of Florida." (Republican
applause, followed by laughter aa Mann
of Illinois called out to McDermott "Go
'way back and sit down.") Vlv '
"I mean ah act of Congress," persisted
McDermott. "He cannot cite me an act
of Congress, because there is none." Dal*
zell declined to, be interrupted further.
Richardson, the minority leader, moved
to recommit the bill with the following
instructions:
To report a bill reducing the tariff laws and
Internal revenue laws now in force in other
portions of the United States to a revenue basis
and to apply the same to alt portions of the
United States, including the Philippine Islands,
to be in effect until order has been - restored
there . and . the Filipinos permitted, with the
aid of the United States, to establish a stable
and independent government.
The motion to recommit' was lost, 122 to
172. It -was a strict party vote, so far as
the Republicans v/ere,concerned,but there
were three votes against the motion from
the Democratic side, cast by Broussard,
Davey and Robertson, all of. Louisiana.
Meyer of Louisiana was paired against
the motion with Foster (Democrat of Il
linois.)
The bill was then passed, 163 to 12S. The
three Democrats from Louisiana who vot
ed against the motion to recommit Voted
for the bill, and" five Republicansâ Mc-
Call, Massachusetts; Littlefield, Maine;
Heatwole, Eddy and Stevens, all t of Min
nesota,-voted with the Democrats against
it. At 4:40 the House adjourned.

CLOSING WEEK
Jefferson DeAngelis Still
Drawing Large
Audiences.
Orpheum Road Show Com
ingâ" Charley's Aunt "
Next at Alcazar.
It does not lo^ok at all like the worst
seven days of the theatrical year up at
the Central Theater this week, with "Mul
doon's Picnic" as the magnet. The house
Is crowded nightly, and the classic Mul
doon seems to be just the kind of picnic
that the audience wants up there. The
farce is funny enough in itself for those
who like that kind of thing, and is par
ticularly well put on at he Central, but
there is an unearned increment of fun
coming to it from the 'cast, the comical
contrast between their usual melodra
matic stunts and the glad horse-play of
"Muldoon's Picnic. 1 ' Incidentally, it is a
pretty good stock company that can turn
that kind of a somersault with the success
of the Central company with "Muldoon."
but they do both things equally well, and
it's greatly to their credit.
It is quite worth the price to see An
nette Marshall, the tragic Herodlas of. "A
Voice in the Wilderness," pea-shooting
and doing cakewalks as Hannah Muldoon.
with innocent flaxen curls tied up with
baby blue ribbon around her rosy cheeks,
an infantile frock and sash, and ankle
strap slippers on her nimble feet. Her
Cakewalk is just as good as her usual
tragic stunt, and she seems to Â«njoy every
minute of it. Hallett Thompson, the dude
leading man, comes in wearing a suit
that defies description at shooting dis
tances and has a sixteen-ounce-to-the
pound "Chimmie Fadden" accent, as Tim
McCormick. Stanley Ross, the silk-hat
ted villain of other days, is a double-dyed
Salvationist with conviction. Harry Con-
Ion and James Corrigan are in their "ili
ment" as Muldoon and Mulcahey, and
Ernest Howell and Edwin Emery both
add to the general hilarity. Rosa Ben
nett is an unembarrassed miss of 10âper
hapsâwho is real sweet as Jennie and
sings and dances well. Georgie Cooper,
who has a pretty specialty, with assist
ance from two of the tiniest coons that
ever trod a stage, is a sprightly Ma&gie,
and Gertrude Claire and Margaret Mar
shall both fit into their parts. Altogether
"Muldoon's Picnic" is worth seeing.
"The Silver King" Is the holiday biil
Jefferson de Angelis, in his amusing
production "A Royal Rogue," is still at
tracting profitable audiences at the Co
lumbia Theater. De Angelis remains at
the theater up to and including Sunday
evening next, when he will give place to
the charming actress. Miss Mary Man
nering, in "Janice Meredith." Miss Man
nering is already, a strong favorite here,
and since her last appearance is eaid lo
have strengthened considerably in her
art. She is one of the prettiest women
on the American stage, as well as being
one of the cleverest, and her engagement
should be one of the successes of the win
ter season. In Miss Mannering's support
ing company are to be found among other
well-known names those of Charles Cher
ry and H. S. Northrup, both favorites of
the theater-going public here.
The Tivoll's holiday attraction, "Little
Red Riding Hood," is finding many new
admirers nightly, and deserves every one
of them. It is the best Christmas produc
tion that the Tivoli has yet put on, and
will doubtless serve to fill the house for
many weeks yet. Hartman has a good
role as Simple Simon, Annie Myers has!
a soubrette role that fits her neatly as
Boy Blue, Webb is excellently piaced
as the wicked baron, and Harry Oashman
is sufficient as Granny Hood and Miss
Chapman as Red Riding Hood. There are
new songs, new ballets, new Jokes, and a
gorgeous transformation scene, to com
plete the attractive bill.
"Rip Van Winkle," the current bill at
the California Theater, is pleasing the
patrons of the popular house. Thomas
Jefferson's interpretation of the title role
has aroused a considerable interest and
has charm, loveableness, and some power.
The holiday attraction will be the fa
mous spectacular comedy "The Devil's
Auction," one of the Charles Yale me
chanical and electrical wonders. It is a
production that is particularly suited to
the children's tastes, and two matinees
will be given during the week, on Christ
mas day and Saturday afternoon as
usual.
' â¢ â¢ * *
"The Gay Mr. Lightfoot" is the current
bill at the Alcazar, and is being much
enjoyed by the patrons of the house.
Frank Bacon is well cast in the title
role. M. L.. Alsop as Mr. Jerome and
Marion Convere, Marie Howe and Mar
garet Wycherley all find opportunity for
their varying talent in the piece. "Char
ley's Aunt" will follow-.
Mr. and Mrs. Gardner Crane in their
legitimate comedietta. "A Happy Pair,"
are scoring a great hit at the Orpheum

"Caught With the Goods." The JDumond
Parisian Minstrels, Rose and Jeannette,
the dainty juvenile dancers; Mr. and Mrs.

the Norwood brothers, with the Blograph,
complete an excellent programme. All of
the above turns will be seen for the last

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A FEW REASONS
Which Are Rapidly Making a New
Catarrh Curs Famous."
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, the new Ca-
tarrh cure, has the following advantages
over other catarrh remedies: ;
First: Theee tablets contain no' co-
calne, morphine or any other injurious
drug and are as safe and beneficial for
children as for adults; this Is an Import-
ant point when It Is recalled that many
catarrh remedies do . contain these very
objectionable Ingredients.
Next: Being in tablet form this rem-
edy does not deteriorate with age or an
exposure to the air, as liquid preparations
Invariably do.
Next: The tablet form not only pre-
serves the medicinal properties, but It is
so far more convenient to carry and to
use at any time that it is only a question
of time when the tablet will entirely su-
persede liquid medicines as It has al-
ready done in the medical department of
the United States army.
Next: No secret is made of the compo-
sition of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets- they
contain the activer principles of Eucalyp-
tus bark, red gum, blood root and Hy-
drastin, all narmles3 antiseptics, which
however, arc death to catarrhal germs
wherever found, because they eliminate
them from the. blood.
Next: You can not cure catarrh by lo-
cal applications to the nose and throat,
because these are simply local symptoms
and, such treatment can not possibly
'reach the real,, peat of catarrhal -disease
which is In the blood; for this reason, in-
halers, douches, sprays and powders nev-
er really cure catarrh, but simply give
temporary relief. Which a dose of plain
salt and water will do just- as well
Catarrh must be driven out of the sys-
tem, out of ' the blood, by an internal
remedy because an internal remedy Is the
only kind which can be assimilated Into
the blood. "
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets do this better
. than the old form of treatment because
they, contain every safe specific known to
modern science in the antiseptic form of
the disease. v
Next: The use of Inhalers, and spray-
ing apparatuses, besides being ineffective
and disappointing, is expensive, while a
complete treatment of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets can be: had at any.' drug -store in
the United States and Canada for JO
cents. \ â .-â¢â ,

FORESTERS WIN
IMPORTANT SUIT
Judge Seawell Renders
an Opinion of Great
Interest.
Decision Covers Troublesome
Question Concerning
Delinquencies.
Judge Beawell yesterday denied a mo
tion (or a new trial of the suit Insti
tuted by Mrs. Sophia Luhrs against Court
Star of tho Mission of the Ancient Order
of Foresters for $75, which the by-laws
of the Court provides should be paid to
the widow of a "financial" member at tho
time of his death.
Mrs. Luhrs Is the widow of F. Luhrs,
who died In March, 1S99. The Foresters
refused to pay her on the ground that
Luhrs at the time of his death owed
thirteen weeks* dues, and in consequence
was not a "financial" member. Mrs. Luhrs
accordingly entered suit In the Jus
tice's court for the amount, but lost her
case. An appeal was taken and Judgo
Seawell In denying the motion for a new
trial sustained the decision of the lower
court.
â  The motion for a new trial was based
on the ground that "F. Luhrs died after
the meeting night of the month subse
quent to which month the forfeiture of
benefits was to attach under defendant's
by-laws," and that "the evidence was in
sufficient to justify 'the finding that the
decedent did not pay the arrears of his
said monthly contributions, amounting to
thirteen weeks." A new trial was also
asked for on the ground that Luhrs was
not notified of his suspension for non
payment of dues.
. Judge Seawell holds that "the loss of
the rights to benefits is not dependent up
on the suspension of a member but upon
his delinquency In the payment of dues,"
and that "a member is suspended wheth
er he have notice or not."
The decision of Judge Seawell also cov
ers the much-mooted question of the time
When dues for a month become delin
quent. Judge Seaweil held "that the
word 'owing' may be properly used to
indicate a present obligation which Is
payable in the future, and that "the
dues for March are 'owing' on the first
meeting night In March but are payable
on any meeting night In that month."
Judge Seawell also held that the mere
owing of three months' duea is enough to
deprive a member of benefits and that
the by-laws were not intended to require
that he should owe "more" than three
months dues.
, Judge Sea-well's opinion sustains the ac
tion taken by the Subsidiary High Court
of Foresters in similar cases.

ROBERTSON APPOINTED
CHIEF FOOD INSPECTOR
Health Board Suspends Daputy J. W.
Tracey for Filing False Reports
of Inspections.
The Board of Health met yesterday and
appointed William R. Robertson to the
of Chief Food Inspector, he be
ing first on the civil service eligible list.
The appointment takes effect on January
1, 1902. J. A. Brown, w*io now holds the
position, was too far down on the list to
be certified. J. T. Silvera will succeed
Hobertson as Assistant Food Inspector.
The board tiled charges with the Civil
Service Commission against Assistant
Food Inspector J. W. Tracey and sus
pended him for thirty days, pending in
vestigation. Health Officer O'Brien pre
sented n report from Chief Food Inspec
tor Brown, showing that Tracey had re
ported fourteen Inspections he had never
made. Dr. O'Brien recommended Tracey'a
dismissal, but the board suspended him
instead.
The board adopted Dr. McCarthy's res
olution providing for the removal of teut
three assistant emergency surgeons each
year instead of the entire force, as was
the rule formerly. The places will be
tilled by the chief surgeon, who was In
structed to report on the competency of
subordinates in the hospitals.

Eight Chinese Excluded.
Tho Russian bark Behring arrived from
KamschatUa a few days ago with eight
Chinese laborers on board, and they have

nese laborers were shipped at this port
on board the Behring about a year ago
by a Chinese contractor, and no provision
Was made for their return In conformity
with the exclusion act. They lived for
six months in Russian terrlt6ry, and
eight of them have asked the privilege of
returning. The Collector says that he
cannot admit them and that they must
be taken back to Siberia.

Conditions in Wall Street.
The New York circular of Henry Clews eays:
"Liquidation has been quite extensive during
the past week, due chiefly to two causes, firmer
money and the collapse In copper securities.
The decline in the latter, of course, forced the
celling of good stocks to protect accounts; hence
the weakness of the better class of securities.
There was less resistance to declines than wit
ji<*sse<2 during the summer months, though
vhether this was due to free selling or willing
ness of the market leaders to permit a moder
e'e degree ot liquidation is a matter of doubt.
U'here is no question, however, that the future
of the market will be benefited by the pres
ent reaction. An advance could not be con
riucted without a fresh start, and a fresh start
â was impossible except at a lower level and with
new blood. There is plenty of money seeking
Investment, but not at top prices; those who
have large sums to Invest and whose opera
tions must be depended upon for a successful
bull movement are not likely to buy at the end
of a rise. If. therefore, the powers who control
the market and who are vitally interested In
higher rrices have now willingly permitted the
nisrket to respond naturally to actual condi
tions, and this seems to be so, they have acted
visely. It was the interference with the
natural swinu of the markets at the time of
th.- United States steel strike, the corn crop
damage, the death of president McKinley and
other untoward events that brought the stock
trarket into the condition of deadlock which
It has endured for the past two months. Had a
recession of 8 to 10 points been permitted be
tween July and October we might now have
lÂ«?en on the eve of a legitimate bull campaign;
instead, the market teems to be now tardily
responding to drawbacks which cannot be. ig
nored. The only thing that will adjust the
â¢noney situation with the banks in connection
with their reberves Is liquidation in the stock
market, as through that process only at this
time can the bank reserves be maintained. . It
Is this feature of the situation that threatens
lower prices for stocks before we get out of
the present rut of money stringency. The re-
oeding prices in the stock market of late should
not have taken any sagacious person by sur
prise, as they were Inevitable. Artificial
methods in keeping up prices beyond what
conditions warrant cannot be continued indefi
nitely. Wall street ought to have had three
big surges In prices at least during the last
Â«=rveral months, but artificial methods In bridg
ing over prevented such natural setbacks. The
i-teel strik* was sufficient Incentive for a good-
Fizpd break: the corn crop damage was another,
and the assassination of President McKinley
was a third. The effect of these three import
cnt factors upon the market was -scarcely per
ceptible owing to the herculean efforts which
xiere trade to prevent a semi-panic in each in
stance."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 18.â The principal effort
of. the operators in stocks to-day continued to
be to solve the enigma of the copper question.
The watic fluctuations of Amalgamated Cop
per reflected the uncertainty of mind of the
professional operators In this stock, who largely
monopolised the dealings. Traders of the class
â w^io usually depend upon the toss of a coin
or upon the aggressive â  leadership of larger
operators for actuating motive talked glibly of
technical conditions in the copper trade Of
actual developments the additional cut in the
prices of copper was the feature of the day
â¢ The weakness yesterday In Amalgamated
which continued this morning, was due to the
assumption that them would be further de
clines in the price of the company's product
The rally of . 4% points . In the price of the
etock after the reduction of the selling prices
.by the United Metals Selling Company Indi
cated that yesterday's selling, was by profes
sional bears and was. overdone. The fact that
the former difference between the price of Lake
Superior and electrolytic copper was narrowed
by to-day's changes was taken, as an indica
tion of- an adjustment of differences of opinion
between the controlling Interests In Amalga
mated Copper and Calumet and Hecla. as It
has been supposed that the latter interests
maintained that Amalgamated had an undue
advantage from the relative cheapness of elec
trolytic copper. Many rumors â¢ were Indus
triously circulated of progress toward adjust-
ment of all the late unsettling Influences In the
copper situation. The lowering of prices by the
dominant powers In the trade Is believed to
have cut off the margin of profit on production
of many of the minor producers, thus fore
shadowing a decline In production. The bear
contingent in these securities was also appre
hensive that the bottom point had been reached,
as it is obviously bound to do at some time
after its extensive decline. The possibility that
all the bad news was out added to the urgency
of the demand from the shorts. Amalgamated
closed at the top price. 3 points above last
night and C points above the low record price.
Further selling of Standard Oil in the outside
market at as low as 650 was attributed to
sympathy with the weakness In Amalgamated
Copper. The general market showed a dispo
sition to ignore the early weakness In Amalga
mated Copper. The motive for the underlying
strength in the market was the easier tone in
the money market, call loans ruling for the
most part at 5 per cent. Fears of further gold
exports are subsiding and confidence is growing
that the period until the reflux of funds into
the channels of the money market will be
safely tided over. The transcontinental and
grain carrying roads, especially St. Paul and
Union Pacific, were effective leaders in the ad
vance. The announcement of the cut In cop
per, while it drove the shorts to cover in that
.stock and rallied It effectively, cause'd a sharp
reaction . in the general market. The bears
centered their attack on Manhattan, forcing
it Sl& under the best. The high-priced coalers
and a number of specialties, especially the
Cotton Oil stocks. Western Union. Pacific Mail.
Colorado Fuel and the distilling stocks showed
notable strength. The buoyancy finally devel
oped in Amalgamated Copper rallied the gen
eral market and caused a firm closing.
I The bond market was active and firm. Total
sales, par value. $2,115,000. United States old
4s coupon and the 5s registered advanced \h
and the 5s coupon \\ per cent. The 3s coupon

London Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 18.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market to-day was more animated all
around than for a very long time. The closing
was buoyant on the good news from South
Africa and the more definite rumors of an early
peace. The Daily News, the pro-Boer organ,
hints at a settlement of hostilities on Sunday.
Consols recovered, advancing -to 94 1-16. .. In
vestment shares followed and the American de
partment Improved. Northern Pacific was
strong on a report that the Harriman interests
were rebuying their recent sales. The- absence*
of failures on the slump In Amalgamated Cop
per is regarded as a hopeful and important fac
tor in the general situation.
Rio Tintos sold at Â£41 and copper. at Â£50
the ton.
Money was scarce, owing to a Â£750,000 call
of local loans. Gold to the amount of Â£20,000
has gone out to Malta. The Straits Settlements
are buying silver. New York holding off.

CHICAGO. Dec. IS. â At the outset nearly
every bit of news favored an upturn In wheat.
Cables were firmer, receipts, both local and
Northwestern were very small and â  promised
to be smaller because of hard railroading dur
ing the cold weather, and many shorts were
buying. The trade was not large, but the gen
eral tone was one of buoyancy at the opening.
May started a shade to }4c up at 80c to 80%Â®
SOVic and rapidly advanced to SO%c.
the wheat bought early began to come out for
profits there also' developed several bearish
factors that at once sent prices . backward.
The seaboard reported no export sales and even
indicated that foreigners were reselling: there.
The reoort of a disturbed state of affairs in
the Mli.neapolis flour .market and the conse
quent reselling of flour there by millers also
troubled bulls. Outsiders were doing: practl â¢
cally no buying and the holiday dullness pre
vailed against the early advance. May wheat
started . on the slide downward and touched

Weekly Call. $1 Der TearREACHES CRISIS
IN HIS ILLNESS
John J. Valentine's Con
dition Is Gravely
Alarming.
Patient Suffers a Critical
Relapse After Months
of Sickness.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 18.
John J. Valentine, president of Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s Express, who has been se
riously ill at his residence, Thirteenth
avenue and East Twentieth street, for
several months, is in a critical condition.
f naving suffered a relapse on Sunday from
which he has not recovered.
So serious Is the*situation that the only,
absent member of the family, Edward
Valentine, has been summoned home. The
condition is the result of long years of
ailment from a stomach disorder which
the efforts of the physicians have been
unable to more than temporarily relieve.
President Valentine has been confined
to his residence for months. During much
of the time he has been unable to leave
his room. The trouble has been intermit
tent, so far as its serious aspect is con
cerned. For <iays the patient would en
joy fair strength, only to be attacked by
severe conditions that would throw him
back again. Each recurring setback only
weakened the patient, and it has now be
come only a question of a short time
when the end shall come.
For ten years he has been a sufferer,
seeking remedies throughout the world.
In search of health he went East, then
turned to the Orient, and for a time was
m Mexico. But these trips only served
to ward off temporarily the critical pe
riod, which, it is feared, has now arrived.
So low was President Valentine early
this week that no one outside of the
nurses, physician and members of the
family was permitted to see him. Dr.
Liliencrantz has been in charge of the
case. â 
PALLS FROM WINDOW TO
DEATH ON PAVEMENT
Mint House Lodger, Whose Identity
r Is Not Established, Victim of
Fatal Accident-
- A man fell from the second-story win
dow: of the Mint lodging-house at 933 Mis
sion etreet late last night and was in
stantly killed by striking head first on
the stone pavement. When he tumbled
from the window he was clad only In a
light overshirt. The room from the win
dow of which he fell is rented. by May
Taylor, a denizen of the half world. The
police believe that the death was purely
accidental and several of the lodgers In
the Mint House stated that they had
heard no noise in the room such as would
have sounded had the man met with foul
play.
May Taylor said that she was not in
the room when the man met his death.
He had come to her room in an intoxi
cated condition, she said, and she had
left him to go out and make some pur
chases. She claims that she does not
know his name nor anything about him,
further than that he told her that he was
a miner, recently of Arizona. The police
found nothing in the pockets of the dead
man's clothes by which his identity could
be established.
Special Train for Mexico Crowded.
A special train run to enable visitors to
spend the Christmas holidays in Mexico
left this city last evening over the coast

passengers. Among those who left here
were Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson and

with a quantity of black powder, which
they exploded at intervals. While Albert

der that had been given to him it sud
denly went off in his face. In a moment
his clothing was In flames.

dance last night at Golden Gate Hall, and
during the evening Colonel Charles H.
Murphy presented diplomas to sixty-five
graduates. There was plenty of scholas
tic enthusiasm, and as each graduate was
presented with the hard-won credential
of efficiency the hall fairly rang with
cheers. Colonel Murphy had arranged a
clever surprise for his pupils, when, dur
ing one of the waltzes, the electric lights,
covered with crimson bunting, were sud
denly lowered, giving a novel and exceed
ingly pretty effect. 'Jjhis dance was called
"The Twilight," but not one of the pupils
or friends had been made acquainted with
the colonel's plan. ,

dismissed, which was done. When Pardee

and Santa Cruz, but when the complain
ants there were communicated . with by
telephone they replied that they did not
want h'.m and he was released.
Special Permits Are Unlawful.
City Attorney Lane handed down an
opinion yesterday that there is no power
in the Board of Supervisors to make*laws
denying a privilege to the people at large
and granting to one or more special indi

law. It is within the power of the Board
of Supervisors â¢ to amend the fire ordi
nance so as to permit broader privileges

amendment must be made applicable to
all in the same situation and subject to
the same, conditions. , , 'â â :'â

DISAPPEARANCE
DF THE MUSSEL
Many Gatherers of^the
Bivalve Thrown Out
of Employment.
Experts Unable to Account
for Scarcity of the
â  Sea Food.
Sadness fills the hearts of Baciccia and
Martini, the mussel gatherers of South
San Francisco, and the reason of it all
is the sudden disappearance of the mussel
without known cause or good and' suffi
cient reason.' Restaurant-keepers of the
city have endeavored to allay the grum
blings of j the mussel lover, but. the only
explanation forthcoming is that there are
no mussels to be had, that there Is some
thing wrong somewhere, but wherfe' still
remains a deep sea mystery. For thirty
years or more there â  has , been an ample
supply, and even the veteran fishmonger,
Achile Paladinl, and others in the rish
trade are unable to solve that mystery.
That the loss' of the mussel, which is
hoped to be temporary, is a matter of
great importance to those engaged in the
industry, is shown at Baciccia .and Mar
tini's fishing quarters, where many,
"gatherers" are out of employment,
"cleaners" ' being idle, wagon drivers
without occupation and boatmen are seen
lazily sitting besido their bleached boats."
Even officials, those of the State Fish
Commission, are not quite prepared to ac
count for it all. -
\V. H. Cook, the attorney to the com
mission, takes 'a legal view of the situa
tion andjsmilingly declares that a writ of
prohibition must have been issued, . but
gives the sound opinion that in view of
a scarcity of the sea food the State Leg
islature would have the right to enact a
law to protect the mussel with the same
legal guard as given the oyster or the
female crab or the lobster.
J. H. Davis, a deputy of the State
Board of Fish Commissioners, has only
known trouble to come to the mussel dur
ing an extremely raitfy winter, when the
fresh waters from the Sacramento River
came along and" killed them to such an
extent that the Contra Costa shores were
strewn with the dead. There has! in his
opinion, not been sufficient rain this win
ter to have interfered with them, and he
cannot give a scientific or natural reason
to account for the mussel's disappear
ance. : -i
Some fishermen attribute it to probable'
poisoning, as they cling in remarkable
consolidation to the copper of wrecked
vessels. So much is this recognized that
the gatherers avoid taking them from
any parts in the vicinity of the Golden
Gate. There have been no storms to dis
lodge them from their once favored rocks,
or the wharves or piles on the Oakland
side of the bay. which doubly increases
the mystery. The fact remains that such
a condition has never before been known
even to the oldest fishermen and mussel
gatherers of these carts. -

WILLEMSTAR, Island of Curacao, Dec.
18.â La Republica, the Venezuelan official

AFTER MARRIAGE
HE DISAPPEARS
Member of a California
Mining Firm Lost
at Chicago.
Detectives Search for the
Groom, Who Carried
Much Wealth.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 18.â The disappearance
in' Chicago a few days subsequent to his
marriage of James Nolan, said to be a
member of the firm of Nolan. Hayes &
Co., mining brokers at Pasadena, Cal.;
president of the King Solomon Mining
Company of California, interested in min
ing affairs at Spokane and reputed to be
worth several hundred thousand dollars,
is puzzling the police.
For three days Detective Sergeants
Thompson and Gallagher have been seek
ing the man. They traced him to the
Palmer House and other large hotels, but
always arrived too late to find him. The
search was brought about at the request
of the bride of the missing man, who,
prior to her marriage, was Miss Helen E.
Koch. She is now living at 229 Twenty
eighth street. â  '*â¢Â£'â 
Nolan came to Chicago three weeks ago.
Here he met Miss 'Koch and December 6
they went to the marriage license â  office,
secured a license and five minutes later
were husband and wife. The wedding was
performed by Justice J. C. Murphy. On
the Thursday following the marriage No
lan received a telegram calling him to Mil
waukee. ' He has since returned, it has
been learned, but all efforts on the part of
his wife to find any trace of him have
been unsuccessful.
The marriage, it is said, followed a short
acquaintance, and as far as the police can
ascertain Nolan did not know his wife un- !
til he met her upon his visit here. After j
the marriage the couple went to live at !
the Lakota Hotel. The man, it is said, 1
had considerable money and stocks and i
bonds valued at $15,000 on his person when |
he disappeared. . i
WOBK ON WABSHIPS
MAY NOW BE RESUMED
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.â The Navy De
partment has been informed by the Union
Iron Works Shipbuilding Company at San
Francisco that the strike which has pre
vailed at their yard for over half a year
past has been declared off in a number ot
classes of workmen. This information is
gratifying to the department, inasmuch
as the warships let to that company have
been practically untouched since last May. j
It is expected that the classes who still I
hold out will soon return to work, and!
that operations on the warships at San 1
Francisco will be resumed with alacrity, j
Among the big vessels building at this ;
yard are the battleship Ohio, the armored
cruisers California and South Dakota, on i
which work has not yet begun, the pro- I
tected cruisers Tacoma and Milwaukee!
and the monitor Wyoming. j
. Irving M. Scott of the Union Iron Works
stated last evening that he had no knowl
edge of any information being furnished
the Navy Department, as mentioned in
the above dispatch. H.e stated that his
brother, Henry T. Scott, is In Washington
and that the message might be based on
what he had stated as to the situation in
the shipbuilding' yards.
"We are not doing any work on the Gov
ernment ships at present." said Irving M.-
Scott, "but we have a large number of
men at work on other ships, and the ex
perience will fit them to complete the war
ships. The strike situation is the same as
it was. I cannot state when the work on
the warships will be resumed."

culties will ,be overcome and the military

count of the low rates just put into effect

Northern Pacific roads. The question un

GERMANY'S SAY
ABOUT WATERWAY
May Try to Block Work
on the Nicaraguan
Canal.
Berlin Government Interested
by Reason of Concession to
Subsidized Company.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â It has just
come to light that the. German emplro
expects to have something to say about
the Nicaraguan canal because of a OÂ«r
man corporation in a concession that will
be interfered with. and possibly destroyed
by the construction of the canal. This In
terest has been obtained through the pur
chase by the Hamburg-American Steam
ship Company of the Atlas Steamship
Company. The former is a German cor
poration, and the latter Is British.. TheÂ»
Hamburg-American Company Is subsi
dized by the German government, and ita
ships can .be called upon for auxiliary
cruisers of the German navy in time of
war. It is the same line that recently
endeavored to get from the Colombian
government a coaling station near Car
tagena, which it was believed b> tbe>
United States Consul there would it
granted, become the first foothold of thÂ»
German navy on the Western continent.
Under the concession from Nicaragua
which the Hamburg-American line has
acquired, it is claimed by Foreign diplo
mats here, the exclusive navigation rights*
of the San Juan River and of Lake Nicar
agua are secured to the German company.
This government takes the position that
the German company and - the German
government can do nothing in the way vt
interfering with the building of the canal,
and that the United States will not be
drawn into the controversy. It regards
the concession as a matter between tha
holders and the republic of Nicaragua,
and will look to Nicaragua to terminate
the concession and reimburse the holders
when the line is interrupted by the con
struction of the canal.
One fact that is admitted is that ths
transfer of the concession at least estab
lishes another point of friction In con
nection with German designs on the New
World. ' ; 'Â»'' :

LONDON, Dec. 18.â David Lloyd-
George, M. P., in speaking in Birming
ham Town Hall to-night, precipitated a
scene unprecedented in that city since thÂ«
Aston Park riots.
The majority of the audience were hos
tile to the speaker, and were 'enraged by
his pro-Boer and anti-Chamberlain utter
ances. They rushed the police cordon
guarding the platform.
In the meanwhile the building was be
sieged from the outside by a mob of sev
eral thousand people, who smashed win
dows and tried to force the doors, which
had been barricaded. They fusilladed the
audience with stones through the win
dows.
The police reserves were turned out and
succeeded in dispersing the mob after re
peated charges. A number of persons
were injured and the Town Hall was com
pletely wrecked. Not a single window

A GOOD thing to recollect Is this: We do not
reckon a sale complete unless the customer
gets all he is entitled to. We glva a perfect,
sound and undamaged new piano for less
money than is often asked fcr patched up
and made over Instruments, -worked off under
all sorts of disguises. It Is much better to
get a reliable new piano that i:i known, than
a "bargain" that is good only for the tlma
being. Our pianos or customers are not
"wrecked." Ask about our new plan of
$1 60 per week. We sell Wissner. Decker

TO RAISE THE SAN RAFAEL.
Divers Will Go to Work on the Job
NeÂ±t Week.
There is now no doubt In President
Stetson's mind that the wreck of the
San Rafael has been located. Tuesday
the divers went down and brought up a
piece of machinery about four feet long.
It was at once identified by Engineer
Jones as a portion of the crosshead, and
Stetson's doubts were dispelled..
The hull of the vessel is not considered
to be worth much, but the machinery is
as pretty a piece of work as ever left a
machine shop. The "machinery alone is
worth saving, and for that reason an at
tempt will be made to raise the hull.

ACCUSED OF SWINDLING
MAN FROM PORTLAND
Drs. Eppy and Bohannon Arrested
for Obtaining Money by False
Pretenses.
M. E. Mulvey, a son of Michael Mulvey
of Portland, Or., now in the City and
County Hospital, secured a warrant from
Judge Mogan yesterday for the arrest of
Drs. Addie Eppy and John T. Bohannon,
12 Turk street, on the charge of obtaining:
money by false pretenses.
v Mulvey's statement is that his father
had been suffering from cancer in the
mouth and came to the city for treat
ment. He went to the defendants and
they agreed to cure him within two
months on payment of $300. His mother
mortgaged their home and came here with
the money, which wa3 paid to the defend
ants.
Michael Mulvey stopped at 12 Turk
street and his wife kept him company,
paying $3 per week for her board. At tho
end of two months the patient was worse
instead of better, but the doctors Induced
him to stay for another month, charging
him and his wife $14 per week for board
and -lodging. Still the afflicted man be
came worse. Sunday last he offered to take
back $200 and say nothing about the case,
but the doctors refused to srive him a cent
and he was taken to the City and County
Hospital, where his case Is considered
hopeless.
Drs. Eppy and Bohannon were arrested
yesterday afternoon and denied that they
agreed to effect a permanent cure.
BARNES WANTS HIS FEE FOB
FATHERING A RELIEF BILL
Defendant in Suit Holds a Poor Opin
ion of Martin Kelly as a Po
litical Factor.
The trial of the suit of former District
Attorney Barnes against C. F. Wells for
$299, alleged to be due for professional
services, was begun yesterday before Jus
tice of the Peace Long. The testimony
developed that Barnes had succeeded in
getting a relief bill through the Legisla
ture granting $5000 to Wells, who had lost
his left hand by the explosion of a can
non.
Barnes testified that in October, 1900.
Wells' father bad entered into an agree
ment with him to perform the services.
The bill, which originally called for $12,
000, was carried to Sacramento by Martin
Kelly, who handed it to a Senator at
Barnes' request. The elder - Wells told
Barnes that the bill would be defeated if
Martin Kelly had anything to do with It
and urged Barnes to go to Sacramento
himself.
Attorney H. I. Kowalsky testified that
Barnes* services were reasonably worth
J1000. Judge Long reserved his decision.
Claims He Was Assaulted.
Thomas King and Charles Brown, alias
Johnston, both of Colorado, have been
arrested by Police Officer Beach and De-'
tectlve Dlnan on complaint of â William
Krause, a guest at' the Grand Hotel,
who claims that on Tuesday night the
two men â¢ approached him and demanded â¢
money. Krause refused and says that
King struck him. The officers had a
lively time when they attempted to arrest
the men. King .and , Brown appeared be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday charged with
disturbing the peace. Krause was in
structed to swear to complaints against
both men, so as to hold them for further
investigation.
Stabs Comrade in Sack.
Sill Hestor, a ' soldier, was arrested
early yesterday morning by Policemen
McNamara and Matheson on a charge of
assault to" murder. He appeared before
Judge Mogan and hiscase was continued

TONOPAH CLAIMS
YIELD FORTUNES
Carson Jeweler Cleans
Up $86,000 Prom
Leased Land.
No estimate can be made of the amount
of wealth that is hidden in the Tonopah
mining district, according to E. B. Yer
ington of Carson City, who is spending
a few days in this city.
Yerington says that the town of Tono
pah, Nye County, Nev., has now a popu
lation of 1500 people. A. number of those
who took a chance in that district this
year have been most successful. Frank
Golden, a jeweler of Carson City, will
clean up about $86,000 on his leased claim
and Henry Cutting will make nearly as
much.
The Tonopah mining district was first
discovered by James Butler, an old min
ing prospector, who was passing through
the district with his wife. Finding rich
gold quartz specimens, he decided when
he returned; to Carson City to file on the
land. He had no money and was loaned
a small sum to pay for the recording of
the deed and for the assaying. The fame
of his valuable claims spread far and
wide and he had no difficulty in leasing
ground to others.
A Philadelphia syndicate bought 1 But
ler's entire interests last July for 5360,000.
It will take possession of the property on
the first of next month. In the meantime
those who leased the claima of Butler are
working them night and day. Under the
law they will be entitled to all ore on the
dumps at the time the Philadelphia syn
dicate takes possession.
Mr. Yerington says that there can be
no estimate of the value of- the mines, as
none of the shafts have been sunk lower
than 200 feet. Tonopah is -fifty-six, miles
from Candelaria and all supplies have to
be hauled by teams. The water In the
town is very bad; in fact, it is not fit for
drinking purposes. Tonopah Is a â  Hvelv
town, and Mr. Yerington feels assured
that should -the Philadelphia syndicate
find that it has struck a rich mining
property a branch railroad will be extend â¢
ed from Candelaria.

IMPORTANT DECISION IS RENDERED
IN FAVOR OF TELEPHONE COMPANY
Ordinance of Supervisors Placing Tax on Instruments of Corporation Is
Likely to Be Declared-Void, Owing to a Ruling Made by Montana Judge
in Suits Brought in Order to Test Constitutionality of the License Law
THE contention of the Pacific
States Telephone and
Company that the ordinance
passed two years ago by the
Board of Supervisors of. this city
placing a tax of $2 per quarter on every
telephone in use is unconstitutional Is
likely to be made good, judging by a re
cent decision handed down by Judge
Clements of the District Court of Helena,
Mont.
Suits are now pending in. the Superior
Courts of San Francisco County in which
the telephone company resists the ordi
nance of the Board of Supervisors as to
a tax on its telephones. The matter is of
vital importance to 'the company, for if
the ordinance is held. to be valid the cor
poration will be called upon to pay more
than $250,000 a year into the city and
county treasury.
The action of various Assessors "In the
State in placing a valuation of $25 to $501
on "each telephone of the company has
also been resisted by the corporation, and
In the various suits now pending the de
cisions of the courts will be affected by
the rulings made recently in Montana in
similar actions.

HALEY'S WIFE
IS DISTRACTED
Says Her Husband Never
Secured a Divorce
From Her.
On Monday last The Call published the
romance in the life of Miss Leo Nielsen
of Berkeley, who eloped to Reno, Nevada,
with Clarence C. Haley, son of the late
principal of Heald's Business College.
Another woman says that if Haley mar
ried Miss Nielsen lie has committed big
amy.
This woman claims to be Haley's law
ful wife. She is staying at the residence
of her brother-in-law, Mr. Elllngwood, at
472 Waller street, this city. Mrs. Haley
claims that her husband was never di
vorced, that he had no grounds for ob
taining a separation, and that if he has
married again he has done so unlawfully.
Before her marriage Mrs. Haley was
Miss Jennie Crooks of Placerville. Last
night she told her stary to a Call repre
sentative, saying:
I tlrst met Mr, Haley at McCloud, A muÂ«
tual liking sprung up and" before we left wo
became engaged, 1 returned to my home In
Placarvllle and Mr, Haley went back to hU

him. We were united In tha Golden EagK

married MIbb Nielsen. 1 always knew th.it
she was In love with "Ned," but I never
dreamed they would do this, t am sure Mr.
Haley Is too clever to marry the girl, because
he knows he has a wife living, and Bitch a
marriage would only get him Into trouble. Mr.
Haley and I were never divorced. He has
never had any grounds on which to secure a
separation. ,
l Miss Nielsen's mother Is also very much
worried. She called upon me a few days ago
to learn whether we were divorced, and when
I told her that we never had been she wis
greatly shocked.
Miss Nielsen is a daughter of L. N. Niel
sen, a well known resident of Berkeley.
A dispatch from Reno, Nevada, received
by The Call last evening states that
Haley and Miss Nielsen secured a license
there to marry. ,

In the Montana litigation the Rocky
Mountain Bell Telephone Company re
sisted the action of William L. Steele,
Treasurer of Lewis and Clark County,
who sought to recover arrears of license
for two years for all telephones used by
the company in the county.
Is Part of Interstate System.
The State claimed that' the instruments
were used for local business and there
fore were. subject to taxation. The tele
phone company asserted that the tele
phones in question were part of an inter
state system of commerce and were con
,sequentlv exempt from taxation. The as
sessment, of the telephone instruments'
was also a point in the litigation.
Judge Clements, in rendering his deci
sion, held that the telephones were not
used for local purposes alone, but that
they were connected with similar instru
ments in other States and also -worked In
conjunction with telegraph companies for
the transmission of messages, j
Judge Clements ruled that the tele
phones used exclusively in business with
in the State of Montana cannot be sep
arated from its instruments used in in
terstate business. Continuing, Judge
Clements said:
Nor does Political Code 4071, subdivision 2,

SHADBURNES ARE
IN COURT AGAIN
Judge Hunt is Puzzled
by a Tale of Many
" Marriages.
"Mr. Shadburne told* me he had con
sulted with his father concerning contract
marriages, and when he told me that 'his
old man' said all contract marriages were
annulled by the act of 1895 I had no hesir

So said Anna S. Shadburne yesterday in
Judge Hunt's court in explaining why she
married L. A. Shadburne when her hus
band by contract, L. G. Carpenter, was
htill in the land of the living.
Shadburne is suing for an annulment of
marriage on the ground that he wedded a
woman already a wife. Mrs. Shadburno
is contesting the suit bitterly, for there Is
one child and she wants the question of
its legitimacy settled. Shadburne is evi
dently aware of the fact that his auit is
based on poor grounds, for his lawyers
moved yesterday for permission to amend
his complaint by charging hla wife with
cruelty, .
Mr*. Shadburne, upon learning that
her last husband Intended to rid hlmae.lf
of her in the divorce court lost no oppor

The ttlleeed wife ef Samuel \V. Cheyney
admitted In Judge tiloÂ»s v Court yesterday
that during alt u\e time she was intimate
with the mining man she did not use his
name. 8ho Bald she was known by the
name of Maud Nevill, her mnlden name,

her flret hUBbntid, whose name was Jones.
This admission is the first the little,
brown-eyed woman hnB made ulnco the
commencement ot the trial of her suit for
maintenance against her alleged husband.
More than 130 letters, said to have been
written by her to Cheyney, have been

any of them. To all queries she would
say: ' -
"That 13 not my handwriting. It resem

an imitation would."

Deserted on. Wedding Day.
The suit for maintenance instituted by
Laura A. Carmier against Frank B. ,Car
mier was heard for a short time by Judge
Seawell yesterday, and then as the attor
neys for the plaintiff intimated that a set
tlement of the marital troubles could
probably be arranged, the court ordered
the case placed on the reserve calendar.
The recreant .husband Is better known
as Frank Clayton. He Is an actor and for
a number of years appeared at 'the Alca

Each of the defendant company's lnstru

sum of $9 and no more.
The . defendant company has been assessed
and has paid its property tax for city, county
and school purposes and such ' taxes included
the general tax on said instruments and the
personal property of the derendant company.
- The State of Montana and the county of
Lewis and Clark are at no expense for the
inspection or supervision of the defendant's
poles, \wires or instruments.
The Montana decision will be far-reach

as it bears â  on the business of the tele
phone companies throughout the republic.
Judicial Value of Instruments.
The judicial determination of the value
of telephone instruments is the first one
to.be rendered In the Pacific Coast States
and will be an Important precedent In all
litigation wherein the telephone company
resists the assessment on its property.
In the suits brought by the telephone
company to test the constitutionality ot
the ordinance passed two years ago tax
ing each-telephone instrument at the rate
of ?2 per quarter the decisions up to dato
have been in favor of the company. Su
perior Judge Hebbard recently rendered
two decisions in favor of the company
without going into the merits of the ordi
nance.'

the language of thÂ« charter, however,
would *eem to bar any new owners from
using tracks now tn existence, according
to Troy's Interpretation, and apparently
gives the right to. use tracks Jointly to
existing companies only, Tho section
says:
The Board ot Supervisors shall hs>vÂ« the
power to compel the owners of two or morn
of such roads using the same street for any
distance not exceednlg ten blocks to use thÂ«
came tracks and to equitably divide the cost
of construction.
The City Attorney will be asked wheth
er the city will have the right to use
the tracks of the Market Street Company
from Geary and Kearney streets to the
ferry. Also whether the Board of Super
visors had the power to grant a second
franchise in 1878 to the Geary Street Rail
way Company over practically the samo
route.
Troy also questioned the right of tha
board to grant a franchise over Point
Loboa avenue, which he said is part of
the park and under the control of the
park commission.
Troy suggested that in order to obvi
ate any possible legal entanglemen tho
proposed . route be changed to run from
Geary street up to Grant avenue to Pine,
thence down Pine to Market to the fer
ry. Under the State' law the city would
have the right to use five blocks In con-
Junction with other roads.
The committee requested City Engineer
Grunsky to report upon the best route
to extend the Geary street line south of
the park to Nineteenth avenue, instead
having the extension run north of the
park along Fell and Shrader streets.
Russell L. Dunn submitted to the Utili
ties Committee a modified plan and esti
mate of the cost of construction of the
plan, heretofore suggested, In connection
with his proposal to sell to tho city tho
Visitacion Water Company properties,
and other water and appurtenant prop
erties, including what is known as the
Giant Gap water supply. The modifica
tions of plan are:
The substitution of two main pipe, lines from
the Rosevllle reservoir to San Francisco, hav
ing together a maximum capacity of 60,000,000
gallons dally, In place of one pipe with a maxi
mum capacity of 45,000,000 gallons dally.
The addition of a supplementary reservoir
on the pipe line near the city, having a ca
pacity of storage of about 2.000.000,000 gallons.
â  The object of these modifications is to
make the plan and cost of the Giant Gap
water system compare more directly
with the Tuolumne project of the City
Engineer and tho Board of "Works.
Dunn produces figures to show that tho
Giant Gap system would cost $3,189,139,
after the capitalization of the reasonable
earning: of its surplus water power, as
compared with $38,206,200 estimated for the
Tuolumne project by the Board of Pub
lic Works and City Engineer.

Suit Instituted by City to Becover
Delinquent Taxes Will Go to
Trial.- '
Judge Seawell yesterday overruled tho
demurrers interposed by the Contra Costa
Water Company and the Oakland Water
Company to the suits brought by thla
city to recover delinquent taxes.
When the suit waa first instituted thÂ«
defendants demurred to the complaint on
the ground that it did not state a suffi
cient cause of action, and that it was
ambiguous. J The demurrer was sustained
by Judge Seawell. who. however, granted
a motion for leave to file an amended
complaint. The demurrers overruled yes
terday were on the same ground as the
demurrers, to the original complaint. The
amended complaint, however, was not
faulty, and the matter will now come uo
for trial. - â¢â¢..-'
The Oakland Water Company Is being
sued for delinquent taxes amounting to
$9780 50 and the Contra Costa Water Com
pany for $14,670 50.
