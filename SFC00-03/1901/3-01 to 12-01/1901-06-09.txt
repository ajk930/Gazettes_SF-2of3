scarcely any variations was our daily

as comfortable as possible when suddenly
from among the rocks came the shrill
whistle of bullets. A palm leaf fell on
my head. The Assassins were giving us
notice cf their approach. We prepared
a defense by putting the camels, with
their knee tethers on them, between the
palm trunks. Theie wÂ«Â±s it soft thud and
a camel laid its long neck along the
ground and closed its eyes. We knew
enough of the "resout's" methods to feel
sure they would not rush us until they
were sure of their prey. A bullet passed
through a pan of barley water, making a
tremendous noise, and then the first shout
came from the rocks above. j

OVER THE
SHIFTING
SAHARAwas only a step across the Basilian
Straits to the string of islands that stretch
across the sea to the bis island of Borneo
and form the territory of his magnificent
Excellency the Sultan of Sulu.
/That rival of the sun, the Sultan of
Sulu. got up one morning about six
months ago feeling very much out. of
sorts. He may have been bilious, he may -
not have slept well; anyhow, things
seemed to go wrong -from the moment he
got cut of bed. The first news he received
was that a batch of slaves had escaped in
a Singapore trader. Then came the t'd-' .
ings that the Tapavi pirates had seized a
giant proa on the way to Sulu with gifts,
tribute and taxes from the island of Sa
bate. This was too much for his Imperial
Highness. He couldn't catoh the Singa
pore trader, and if he did he might get
into trouble' with a, British or American
man-of-war, but with a little persistency
he could catch those pirates. In that i
event every civilized power would pat him
on the back for takins a whack out of a. r
pirate and say he was getting up to date
and earning his pay from Uncle Sum. Be- .
sides, the Sultan very much wanted to r
recover the original gifts, tribute and
tcxea from the pirates, together with
whatever loot * his enterprising- officers
might capture in their village.
The Sultan had had his eye on this same
nest of pirates for some time and had fig
ured out that it would be a very profitable
business stroke to exterminate and sack â¢
the village of such a successful lot oÂ£ un
conscionable looters.
So the Sultan ordered out several of h.'s
best lighting vessels and told the com
manding officers to bring back the -head's,
of the pirates, together with their treas- ' "Â¦ Â¦
ures, or prepare themselves for punish- Â¦/
ment. - _ â¢':'.'â¢â¢Â¦
The pirates' nest was in. a land-locked
cove, magnificently situated for;' defense.
A narrow, winding channel led : . through-'.
the treacherous coral reefs to the -small
river bay. The island .itself pvas _ ."'distant ;â¢ .
from the regular routes of vessels.'and'no'" -'
navigator would have . suspected the har
bor entrance unless he had been feeling -
along the coast verjv^lose^ inshore.^ The ...
cove not only' was defended by^prods but .
two forts near the shore mounted several
four. and six pounders. The guns were"
somewhat out of date, but very useful iii
case of an attack by natives.
On the land side the pirates had run a .
line of ramparts around their entire vil
lage. It was stiffened by three forts, like
wise outfitted with several small cannon.
The Sultan's officers through old-time
deserters from the camp had a fairly good
idea of the layout of the pirate village.
They knew better than to attempt to.
reach it by the channel. Bright and early
one day they sent four fighting proas as
Â¦ a decoy to engage the attention of the
pirates. There were seven pirate proas
in the bay; they were speedily got under .
way and n^oved out cheerfully, to meet the
attack. Meanwhile the crews and sol
diers in five other proas had been disem
barked and marched around to the attack
on the land side. Within an hour the land
and water forces on each side were ham
mering hard at each other. . The guns
blazed out and the obsolete old cannon
roared and made lots of smoke. Some of
them burst and killed as many among the
defenders as among the enemy, but
neither side minded such accidents in the
fury of the engagement. "Stinkpots"
Yf OHX J. BAXTER is just back from
I the Philippines and Spice Islands
\ with a stirring stor^' of hairbreadth
J adventures in an effort to recover
a lot of treasure buried by a band
of South Sea pirates. The rendezvous
of these pirates in the Sulu archipelago
Â¦was surprised" and razed by the Sultan's
orders several months ago. Nearly all
the cutthroats were exterminated. One
American adventurer. Clifford Peters,
was instrumental in aiding? one of â¢ the
pursued sub-chiefs. In return, the pirate
â¢ told him where the treasure" was buried.
Later on Clifford Peters was badly
wounded, in a Penang resort, and be
fore he died he told the secret to his
friend Baxter. Baxter declares he could
walk straight to the treasure if a half
score of vigilant Malay pirates did not
stand in the way. These pirates do not
know exactly where the cache is, but
they know it is close to a certain spot,
and they are deadly determined that no
one but themselves shall capture it.
Baxter would have interested Luzon par
ties in trying to lift | the loot, but he
Â¦was afraid that any crew signed there
-would prove as treacherous as the pi
rates, so he determined to return homo,
get friends to stand in with him and
outfit a suitable vessel, properly manned.
As he puts it:
J "I am dead certain that I can get the
treasure if I have the right kind of men
.to help me. and I don't want to take
'any risks of losing it, once I have got
it on shipboard. That's' the reason I
have come to this country to get equip
ments." .
Baxter is a comparatively young man.
me entered the University of Callforn'a
Jas a special, and left just before the
Spanish war. went into business in the
local agency of an Eastern tirm, and
soon after the war was dispatched to tho
Philippines to ascertain the chances of
developing- trade there. He is a careful,
ghrewd fellow, and never allows himself
to be carried outside the regular chan
nels of business into speculative realms.
Cent per cent is his motto. That is why
his friends declare that there must be
a goodly amount of treasure buried in
the alleged place, else Baxter would not
be wasting his time and money in set
ting up a company to go after it. Cliff
Peters was really the first white man
who located the pirate treasure. Peters
was a. rough-and-ready adventurer, a
relic of the spirits of swashbuckler daya,
a man who would have been conspicu
ous had he lived in the venturesome, days
of Raleigh and Drake. Baxter first, met
Peters in a preparatory school here. At
that time he was planning to go to the
university, but a school chum, whose
father had a cattle ranee in Arizona bore
him south on a vacation.' Thereafter
schoolboy days were ended for, Peters.
The free life of the range was too much
for his spirits. He drifted over the Mex
ican border, then drifted out of sight for
several years, till one day several of his
friends bumped into him packing his
stuff over the. Chilkoot pass in 'the " first'
wild stampede for the Klondike; He was
ttill the same Pe'ters, full of adventure
and devil may care, out for anything. He
roamed over Alaska, and experienced all
the ups and downs of a man who is just
missing a fortune.
When the Spanish war came he was off
to the Philippines, but not as a soldier.
Peters always declared he would never
sign a contract to work for Uncle Sam
or any other man for a year or more. He
always wanted to be his own boss, besides
he thought there was more money to be
picked up in the wake of the army by a
man who had his wits about him. Gen
eral Otis and his subordinates made it
warm in and about Manila for Peters and
his ilk, but Peters didn't mind that. He
was after a big clean-up, and he knew it
was somewhere in the Philippines, and all
that was required was a little time and
patience to locate and lift it. But pres
ently Manila got too hot for Peters and
he started again on his drifting, this time
along those seductive currents that wind
in and out among the thousand and one
captivating South Sea Islands. From
Luzon he wont to Palawan, then to Iloilo
and thence to Mindanao. From there it

The Process of
Manufacturing
Rubber Bands
Â£=ij=3HE little elastic rubber band that la
I nowadays used in various businesses
ii in place of twine seems a simple sort
. hing, but there are few if any
of the multitudinous articles made out
of rubber for which there is such an enor
mous demand, especially In the United
States," remarked a wholesale dealer in
rubber bands In New York to the writer
the other day. "In this country the num
ber of rubber bands sold in one year
amounts to about 400,000 gross, or 57,000.000
single bands. At least GO per cent of the
goods are made in New York and the rest
are produced in factories located in New
Jersey and New England. In New York
there are a half dozen factories devoted
partly or exclusively to the manufacture
of rubber bands.
"The process by which the bands are
made is simple. The rubber in a liquid
state is molded into tubing of sizes suita
ble for forming the small and medium
varieties of bands. When the tubing Is
ready for use it is put into a rapid run-
ning machine having knives, which cut
or slice the rubber into bands. The Iarg
er*bands are cut by machinery from flat
sheets of rubber and joined together with
the aid of heat and a pressing machine.
"Rubber bands are made in only two
colors, black and brown. They range In
size from one-cuarter of an inch to six
Inches in length. The smallest bands are
one-sixteenth of an inch wide and the
largest are one and a half inches wide.
The smallest bands are worth 24 cents
per gross, while the medium sized bands
sell at from 48 to 96 cents per gross whole
sale. Larger sizes cost from $1 up to $8
per gross.
','The greatest consumers of rubber
banda are druggists and grocers. They
use the smallest and medium sized bands
in place of twine for putting up small

periment. The result of his in

follows:
r "While watching some spiders one day
! t occurred to him to try what effect the
sound of a tuning fork would have upon
them. He had a strong suspicion that
they would take; it for the buzzing of a
fly. Selecting a large, fat spider that had
long been feasting on flies, he sounded the
fork and touched a thread of the spider's
web.
"The owner was at one edge. of his web
and the" thread selected was on the other
side. Over his wonderful telephone wires
the buzzing sound was conveyed to tho
watching spider, but from his position ho
could not tell along which particular line
the sound was traveling. f
"He ran to the center of the web in hot
haste and felt all round until he touched
thethread against the other end of which
the fork was sounding. Then, taking an
other thread along with him as a precau
tionary measure, he ran out to the fork
and sprang upon it.
"At this point he found out his mistake.
â¢ He retreated for a short distance, an-1
stopped to survey this new buzzing crea
ture which should ; have ". been a fly, but
was strangely unlike any Insect he had
ever seen. At length, apparently con
vinced that the object at the outer edge
of his web was more suitable for amuse
ment than for an article of diet, he got on
it again and danced with pleasure. It was
evident ; that the sound of the fork was
music to him.". . ,'Â¦Â¦'/.

A Monkey Whose
Sagacity Was
Not Rewarded.
SOME remarkable stories 6i the sa
gacity and intelligence of monkeys
aTe frequently told in the brokers*
offices and other places of resort
of the old sailors who have voyaged to
southern waters.
"It was in the year 1S^2 when I was
cabin boy on the English brig Glenmore,"
saiil one the other day. "The captain had j
a. pet monkey, which he had obtained
from some island ofE the coast of Japan.
The little beast was a remarkably intel
ligent animal and the evidences of its fer
tile brain were many. '
"One day. while cruising off the north
coast of Australia our first mate was tak
ing our reckoning of latitude and long!-,
tude. He had the sextant upon the top of
the aft cabin. The monkey, after carefully
observing every move for a while, seized
the instrument and ran up aloft with-it.
Perched in the rigging he amused himself
by imitating the actions of the mate..-'
"As no reckoning had been taken for
several days we did not know just where
we were, and as the shoals in the. sur
rounding waters were very dangerous the
loss of the sextant would be a heavy one.
Both the captain and mate knew that to
go up after the beast would be to cause
him to throw the sextant either upon. the,
deck or into the water, so it was decided
to wait his leisure. After several min
utes of 'monkeying' with the instrument
he seemed to tire of the sport and came
leisurely down and placed -the- sextant
upon the cabin top in the same position
from which he had, taken it. Everyi one
on board breathed freely again, but as
the monkey looked up* to receive the ex
pected approbation of his master he met
a great disappointment."â Baltimore Sun.

were flung, and when, the ammunition
gave out they fell upon each other with
knives and hatchets. The arms they used
may have looked rusty and obsolete for a
modern battle, but there was no question
about the lighting courage of the com
batants. Neither side hoped for quarter
if captured, and neither side gave it. It
was a fight to the death.
The Sultan's proas working up the Â»de
vious channel made slow progress when
opposed by the pirate boats. The best
they could do was to engage the atten-
tlon of the battle and prevent them from
reinforcing the forts. Both sides realized
the land battle 'would decide, the fortune
of the day.
So the Sulus hammered and pitchforked
the wretched pirates from house to house
toward the waters of the cove, where the
crews of the three surviving proas waited
with ready guns to blow them into eter
nity. Men, women and children were un
hesitatingly slaughtered while the fury
of the fight was on. After it was all over
some seventeen wounded pirates were
gathered up. manacled and pitched in a
proa to be taken bank to Sulu as a proof
to his Excellency that the insult offered
. to his Sabate proa had been thoroughly
v. Iped out. Most of the taxes, tribute, etc.,
were recovered, together with a lot of etc.
of the same kind. But the big treasure of
the pirates, the' loot of several years*
gathering-, could not be found. Threats,
torture^a_nd promises failed to wring the
secret of its hiding place from any of the
survivors. They all affirmed that the chiefs
alone knew its whereabouts. Seven of the
leading chiefs were among the dead, two
of them, Mulof and Dagol, had somehow
escaped. So a guard waB left over the
blazing ruins and the proas sailed away
with the recovered tribute and the sev
enteen pirates doomed to execution.
Cliff Peters, risen to the position of part
owner and master of the trading schoon
er;. Southern Star, â¢ was. cruising around
> when one day he bumped into a crazy log
laft tearing all- that was left of the half
starved sM&'"blfaty wounded pirate* sub
j chief, Dagol., How long it had been since
; the- pirate pushed ; off from the island
when th<* last of his cronies were being
.slaughtered by the Sultan's soldiers no
one could guess, least of all Dagol him
self, for he was in a raging fever and
completely cut of his head. The pictur
esque situation of the hacked up pirate,
his dress, and the jewels he wore, appeal
ed to the fancy of the adventurous Pe
ters. He wanted to know his story, and
if there was any chance to earn gold and
glory from the part of the southern seas
where --e came from. So Peters got out
the mcdlcir.e chest and set to 'work to
patch up the battered pira"te. It was a
hard and discouraging job for both par
tics, though to do Peters due credit he
never wavered from his task. But the Sul
tan's men had made too good a job in
their efforts to hack the life out of the
pirate. He came to consciousness all right,
and for a time he appeared to be getting
slowly better: then came a period of ups
and downs, the ups having a slight de
gree the better of it. Peters thought he
would pull his man through, and told him
so. It was during this period that the two
became quite friendly and the pirate, told
all ube'-t the life on the island and the
last big tight. He let fall hints about the
buried treasure and in a general way he
and Peters discussed the chances of bring
ing the schooner Southern Star to the
island, after the Sultan's men had drawn
off, and trying to lift the loot.
All might have gone as they planned
but one night a savage wound of the pi
rate besan to bleed afresh and his Ufa
and troubles all went out of him before
the morning light. He seemed to know it
was comlnsr and told Peters so while the
latter bent over him and used all his
rough medical skill to stop the life-ebb
ing- flow. Peters' apparent disinterested
ness impressed the sufferer and he told
him, almost with his last breath, the ex
act spot where the treasure lay hidden.
Th'e weighted canvas with the body of
the pirate was hardly shot overboard
when Peters steered a straight course for
the Island.
It was a rash move, for not only did it
put the Sultan's suspicious soldiers on
guard but it warned some half score pl-
rates, who had escaped the massacre and
were hiding in the jungle. Both of these
parties knew the treasure was somewhere
there and the .sight of a schooner noslns
about the offlng with a boatload of in
quisitive men trying to reach the shore
unobserved told them as plainly as print
that outsiders had got an inkling of the
treasure pit and had joined in the quest.
So all three parties settled down to stub
bornly watch one another.
Peters was the first to give up in dis
gust. He didn't care. for the pirates; he
knew he could beat them out In a fight,
but the Sultan's men looked too much for
him to tackle with the outfit he had with
him. He determined to run over Manila
way and pick up recruits for the work
among the refuse of the army and the
roving adventurers gathered there.
But luck went against him. In a. saloon
up the Penang River he got into a row
with a Filipino over the sale of a lot of
copra they had bought on speculation the
year before, and Peters was stabbed. His
friends did . all they could for him, . but
what with his irritability over confine
ment when the treasure was almost with
in his grasp and the enervating climate he
was quickly in a bad way. Baxter found
him groaning, cursing his fate and the
doctor when he reached the village on his
rounds of buying up the season's hemp.
"Baxter," said the relieved Peters, "you
look more like an angel than anybody I've
seen since I've been in this God-forsaken
country." He Â¦ wrung his old school
friend's hand and began to cry. He was
very low at the time. His old fatalism
still clung to him. "I'll go like Dagol."
he said. "I'll go out in the dark and won't
see the sunrise, but stay with me, Jack,
old man. Stay with me when I'm going,
and I'll make it worth your while."
Baxter promised him he wouldn't desert
him in that out-of-the-way place, and the
grateful Peters gave him a hint of the
pirate's treasure. For a time Baxter
thought the story of the treasure was but
the vagary of a man suffering with a
fevered wound. Later on, however, Peters
supplied him \v!th a line of facts which
showed there were cold, hard elements of
truth In the story.
Sure enough, as Peters had predicted,
the night came when his wound began to
bleed afresh. It seemed to knock the
hope and life out of him. He talked about
the old schoolboy days while Baxter
worked steadfastly over him and of the
wild adventures he had had. Before it
ended he related all that Dagol had told
him of the buried treasure and how he
had satisfied himself of the truth of the
story when he visited the island on the
Southern Star and pirates and soldiers
stood between him and it He advised
Baxter how to go about lifting it and
then, as with the wounded pirate, his
life went out just before the dawn. "
That was over four months ago. ' Baxter
had to arrange his business affairs before
he could devote his -whole time to ' the
matter of lifting the treasure. But he Is
ready for It now. That is why he has
come to this country and Is now going
East to interest certain business friends
-who have heard the story and who think
there Is enough in it to warrant their in
vesting in the company that is being
formed. " v -

A QUEER WAX CROP.
DO you see that, woman In black sit
ting there? said a railroad detec
tive. "Well, she possesses the rare
gift of being able to^cry naturally
and at will.
' "If she sees a group of well-dressed
men In a station waiting for a train she'll
sit or stand very nesr them and burst out
crying. Of course, her misery will attract
attention and some man will surely come
to her relief. The story is that she has no
money to buy a ticket to get to her dyins
daughter in the next town. It is a com
mon thing for men tc give her a fewjiol
lars promptly and never ask any ques
tions. She has a variety of stories to
tell. I think she is the most successful
beggar I know.
"Crying at will is something I don't
understand. I have seen counterfeit cries
galore on'the stage, but this woman's cry
is m'jch nearer the real thing. No, she
does not hold a handkerchief to her eyes
at all. She just keeps her face well up
and sobs freely, hi?r tears rolling down
her cheeks that all may see them. She
can cry anywhere.
"I've seen that woman stop on the side
walk near where thiee men were standing
and sob as If her heart would break.
"When one of the men asked her what the
matter was she replied she lived twenty
miles away and had lost her purse. The
three men gave her a dollar and a half
in a jiffy and asked no questions. How
often in a day she does a turn like that I
don't know.
"She docs her tur:Â» so artistically that
we. hate to turn the fraud down. One
time I did interfere in the front of a ho
tel, but the five men she had cried to
simply gave me a stony stare and waved
me off as they handed her a few small
bills. They wouldn't hear my story, and
swallowed her tears of woe as a trout
jumns at a fly. I guess those men would
rather feel they'd helped a poor woman
than believe there was such a' fraud.
That's why I let her go.
"No, I am sure she uses no onions, or
other pungent odors to causa her tears.
Her. tear glands are ever ready on tap
and never appear to be empty. Some day*
ago I asked a doctor about it and he
couldn't explain it more than to say that
practice makes perfect, and that the tear
glands could be developed the same as any
other portion of the numan body. I have
promised to show .him the woman soma
time."

So you see they're not to be thought of
when economy is- an object. .It isn't a
case of make at home when the "ruffle,
flouncing" is used, because it simply
can't be bought about here at all, and
the houses that carry them smilingly say.
"They are Parisian^ don't you know."

Cnc of blue ?ilk has a 34-inch flounce
trimmed with black lace, Insertion and
applique. It is absolutely stunning, the
only pity, is that more of -It does not
show. The flounce is cut in a z:gzag
fashion which allows the lace to touch
the lowest underneath ruffle at regular
intervals. The insertion is, of course, put
on in the same way.. A flock of black
birds flies about the skirt, every one" be
ing just where the dip occurs.
Another- swell street petticoat is made
tf black and white striped silk. Two of
tho rufHes are accordion and are each
edged with a tiny black taffeta ruche. To
give it a peculiar effect, a bias piece of
sA is put between the_ two accordions
am a piece of broad lace insertion holds
them in place. That makes the folds fall
here and there in any old kind of way
and Rives a great swish that particularly
pleases most women. The very top is
finished off with another small ruche and
that one is oul lined with a tiny white
'one. Altogether the effect is swell and
looks particularly well with a black' tai
lor suit.
For people who like queer, freakish
things there are shaded green ones. For
instance, four tucks and a piece_of light
tan embroidered in green, four more
tucks In a darker shade, the insertion
belrg the same as above. The colors
deepen In that fashion until a good deep
flounce is made and the last and deepest
color is the final ruffle. The- under ruffle
is a very dark shade and the effect is
most peculiar to say the least. Anybody

â¢'TIip Master Knot of Human Fate." by
KIM* Mered'th. Is a problem novel that
should awaken considerable interest and
dl^cufcslon; It departs from usually ac
cepted theology by supposing a second
delupe and that all the life it'ft- I'n the
world is centered on a little island In a
great sea. Here the author places a man
and a woman, types of the best of the
prerent day. He gives them two huts to
I've In. a supply of food for many months,
plenty of clothes, cattle, horses, donkeys,
rhickfns. dogs. cat c . a cinnamon be?\r
and the rrore elegant articles of civiliza
tion In a library, wrltinr materials and a
violin. Their island home Is very beau
tifrT and very : productive, so the matter
of living causes those only two livinj,' hu
man beirgp of t^ie world very little occa
s.'or; for wcrriment.
They are careful to kll! none of the ani
mals, bm tame them by kindness ,ind
take thflr daily, sustenance from the pro
ducts of the earth.
After their agricultural labors are fin
ished for the day the man attempts to
write a history of their adventure but
thero is so little of variety that he soon
abandons the project. They soon find that
they must take up the consideration of
the problem whether they shall be the
founder? cf a new race or whether they
shall die as the last survivors of human
kind. The end of the book has a little of
the touch of the "Lady or the Tiger" â a
conceit in fiction always popular and new.
The question is reserved for decision in
the last few pages of the book and it rep
resents the ciimax of all their long dis
cussions on the right and wrong of their
future existence. The time has come when
they agree to decide whether they shall
live or die.
"She did not hear'^dam, nor see' him,

" 'Eve.' he repeated. 'Eve. my love, my :

be my wife. Oh, do not torture yourself '

stretching out her arms to him with a ',
gesture of infinite trust and abandon. The ;
long sheer dress fluttered down to the
floor and lay between them.
"They stood as still as if frozen.

"The Devil's Plough" will appeal to
all lovers of the romantic school and to
those- interested in the, more complex
study -of soul development as well. As
the author states in the title it is "the
romantic history of a soul conflict." Un
like the general attempt of .writers dip
ping into- psychological subjects, this
book has a good story to carry the deep
er meaning in this "soul conflict." For
those who read' superficially" there, is of
fered the romance pure and simpleâ youj
may seek and find the deeper mornl ' sig
nificance if you so desire, for it is' there'
for. the hunting.
. The author, states the motif of the
story In a brief, preface: "The,. French
court of 'Anne of.' Austria and Mazarin,
whose atmosphere made work for" the

yer" wap published, and already it -has
reached the 200,000 mark. The fact that it
was from the pen of an unknown author
makes its success all the more remark
able, but it is probafcly accounted for by
the great liking the public has evinced for
works en the order of "David Harum"
and "Eben Holden." This/is one of-that
type. Its characters are of New England,
full of homespun wit and wisdom, and the
atmosphere of the novel is as sweetly'nat
ural as the. breath of the fields. While
Charles Felton Pidgin, thp. author, was
preparing his forthcoming novel, "Blen
nerhassett," which the C. M. Clark Pub
lishing Company will bring out soon,, he
received much- valuable information con
cerning the hero of his romance (Aaron
Burr) from- Mrs. Stella Edwards Plerre
pont Drake. She is a lineal descendant of
Rev' Jonathan . Edwards, who was the
father of Aaron Burr's mother. ; Mr.
Pidgin has" just, received the following
very gratifying letter from her:
Â¦~ "I wish to thank you for the great pleas

and the late William Henry Hurlburt
wrote that "with Mrs. Howe's* hymn, it
constitutes about the sole surviving po
etry of the civil war." Another of Dr.
Palmer's ballads. '.'The j Maryland Bat
talion," has stirred the blood of thous
ards with its etpry of Mordecai Gist and
his "four hundred wild lads" who held
a British force at , bay in the battle of
Long Island long enough to nave the
American retreat from destruction. "A
splendid â¢ piece of work," Charles G. D.
Roberts says of that poem, "inevitable
and unforgetable." Dr. Palmer's ballads
pre all on events in American history, and
thrill one with their patriotic fire. "To
say aught of 'Stonewall Jackson's Way.'"
writes Clinton Scollard. "a lyric that has
made for itself fo sure a place in our lit
crature.were perhaps gratituous; but over
the ringing 'FJeht at the San Jacinto.'
the swinging 'Maryland Battalion.' and
the sturdy 'Reid at Fayal.' one may be
permitted to wax enthusiastic."
Yet fine as these ballads are. "there
are." as Richard Henry' Stodc"ard ob
srrves. "finer poet'eal qualities than bal
ladry requires or admits of. and they are
present in this collection of Dr. Palmer's'
lyrics, notably in the one which opens it,
'For Charlie's Sake,' which authenticates
Itself as. a tender, solemn, fatherly recol
lection of a dead child."
Yet with all these testimonials to the,:
beauty and power of his verse, it was:,
riot until a publisher wrote to Dr. Palmer,
insisting that he gather together those
stray children of his imagination, that ,
he took any steps to make this collection.
He had sung the songs for the pure joy
of singing." and"th"ey*haVe vitality and

RoKEiter Johnson, LL. â¢ D., Editor-in-

"For Charlie's Sake, and Other Lyrics

"A Daughter of. the Prophets," by Cur

writer some years ago by the famous

somewhat delayed in its appearance: It
gives us a view of the modern woman as
we may expect to find her in the twen

ine of the book, beginning her career, as
a lawyer and going on as wife, mother

This convention will be made notable
above any of its predecessors by. the at
tendance of , distinguished men to the
number, of more than 100 from twenty for
eign countries, representing Europe,. Asia,
Australasia, Africa and South America.
This' gratifying feature will be chiefly the
rttult of the personal visitations and
Shuey of Dayton, Ohio. All of the for
eign delegates and guests of the inter
national committee from abroad are ex
pected to speak upon special topics or
participate in general discussion, and re

places. Army and navy secretaries will

without the sacrifice of. any principle, or Â¦

whole, Mr. Stokes .was greatly Impressed

to hear from a hilltop. the soun- of loud

But perhaps the most curious means of

drums made of bamboo hoops, over which
the skin cf some animal Is stretched. The Â¦
drum is used only on important occasions
' â such as the meeting of war or the trial
of some members of the tribe who have
broken some of the complex religious
rules. Then the head man of the village,
who is hidden behind a rough grass
screen, asks Questions of the witnesses

It was during a walk across Black
friars bridge one Sunday evening in May,
1S44, that George Williams, a clerk In the
large establishment of George Hitchcock
&. Co., in St. Paul's Church yard, sug
gested to his friend and fellow-clerk, Ed
ward Beaumont, that they broaden the
religious work then carried on in a small
way in- the Hitchcock establishment by
interesting the employes of other houses
and organizing a society to strive to im
prove the moral and spiritual conditions
cf London clerks generally. A few day3
later these two young men took the in
itiative and sent out a call whose exacs
wording was as' fellows: "You are in
vited to attend a meeting to consider the
advisability of forming a society for im
proving" the spiritual condition of young
men engaged in the drapery and other
trades." To this call thirteen clerks re
sponded. The meeting was' held in young
Ayilliams' bedroom, which was a part of
the building in which George Hitchcock &
Co. did business. There was considerable
discussion as to What name should bo
given to the new society, and finally it
was voted to. call it the. "Young Men's
Christian Association."
This was the beginning of the great re
ligious and fraternal organization which
has spread over the civilized world and
become a tremendous power for good, es
pecially among the^young men.
for occupancy it will have cost more than
$300,000. This institution will be a sort of
club for the officers and men of the navy,
and combine social and religious advant
ages to a degree not heretofore attempted.
Other secretaries of the international
committee have supervision of the asso
ciations among the colored men, the In
dians, and in China, Japan, India, Ceylon
and South America. There are also five
field secretaries residing hi Chicago, New
York, Minneapolis, Atlanta and Kansas
City, whose work Is that of organizing/
stimulating and developing associations
In the United States and Canada. Still
splendid generosity of James Stokes, who,
as a special representative of the inter
national committee of the Y. M. C. A.,
made a journey around, the world and a
supplemental trip to Kurope entirely at Â¦
his personal expense, to draw attention
to the Boston jubilee and to extend invi
tctions to distinguished foreigners to at
tend it. Mr. Stokes visited Hawaii,
Japan, China, India, Ceylon, Egypt and
all cf the countries of Europe.. -His ac
count of his traveis, his receptions, and
Iiis observations is most interesting;- With
Se single exception of Hongkong he
und no city in which the Y. M. C. A.
was not firmly established and .doing a
gooJ work. In that city he was told by a
prominent English clergyman that there
was "plenty of money for boat races, lit
tle for the church and none at all for the
Y. M. C. A." .
In Tokio, on the other hand, he was
more than pleased with the situation.
There he addressed a flourishing associa
tion, which occupies a building of its own,
erected at a cost of $30,000, and whose
president is the Chief Justice of the Su
preme Court of Japan. India was found
to be thoroughly organized with 125 as*
sociatioris, having more than 6000 mem
bers. In some. of the cities visited Mr.
Stokes saw Christians, Jews, and Budrt
h'sts working side by side in theY.-M.
C. A., a state of affairs not paralleled in
any other organization in the worjd;-re-
ton association ami citizens at historic
Faneuil Hal!. Upon the third day a tab
let will be unveiled- in the Old South
Meeting House, where the Boston assi
ciatjon was organized in the year 1S51.
Many entertainments and short excur
sions to historic places in the vicinity of
the Hub have been planned by the Bos
ton association to occur at odd times'" dur
ing the week, and each clay while the con
vention lasts that association will provide
a luncheon for all the delegates, which
will be served in Mechanics' Building. On
the day following final adjournment there
will be an excursion down the bay to
Plymouth Rock, where an oration will be
delivered upon "The Spirit of the Puritans
the Spirit of the Young Men of the ; Twen
tieth Century." '
Many distinguished men have accepted
invitations to the convention.
Among them are President McKinley and
Lord Strathcona, whose acceptances, how
ever, are necessarily conditional; Bishops
' Potter of New York and Baldwin of To
ronto; "the presidents of Knox College,
Toronto; Brown University. Union Theo
logical Seminary, Clark University, Colo
rado College, Tuskegee Institute, -and
Oberlin Theological Seminary; President
Lucius Tuttle of the Boston and Maine
Railroad, and a score or more of business
men, including James II. Eckels of Chi
cago, Selden P. Spencer of St. Louis, Col

y-f 1ST to think of It! Fifty years. &
I half a century, since the Young
\ Ken'* Christian Association of
s% J North America first saw the light
of day. It may seem a ion? time
but. considering; the most remarkable
growth of that organization, it is a mere
nothing.
Fifty years ago there was but one as
sociation: now the number is legion,
and the gcod work is being carried on in
nearly every city, town and small village
of the whole preat I'nited States.
And now they are to have a celebration
on the biggest scale ever known in the
history of the organization. Moreover,
this jubilation will probably be the most
notable religious movement of modern
times i-nd it is a tit beginning for the new
page of the twentieth century that the
association his just turned STer. This
thirty-fourth annual convention will be
hHd in Boston for five days from June
11 to June 16.
The first Young Men's Christian Associ
ation in the wr;rid was organized i.i Lon
don In lf>U and the firs-t in America at
Montreal December 9. 1S51. The work in
the United States was begun with the
formation of the Boston association on
December 29 of the same year. The first
delegated gathering of the North Amer
ican associations met in Buffalo on June
7, 1?34, and the first world's conference
assembled at Paris on August 20, 1S5-",.
under the name ''Conference Universelle
des Unions Chretiennes de Jeunes Gens."'
Thj purpose of the jubilee convention
will be to review the progress of the as-'
social ions of North America for the half
century; to examine critically the re
sults, methods, and actual conditions and
plans cf these associations in the light of
the providential principles and purposes
of the association movement: to inaugu
rate an aggressive spiritual movement in
the associations on behalf of the young 1
men of North America and of the non-
Christian world, and to promote jaoiid
Â¦wide unity among young men who are
engaged in association work. All depart
ments of the Y. M. C. A. work will be
represented by delegates at this conven
tion, including leaders from nearly every
city and. town organization, as well as
the organizations for students, railroad
men, soldiers and sailors, colored men,
Indians, and other special classes.
The principal sessions of the convention
Â¦will be held in the Mechanics' Building,
which contains an auditorium capable of
mating 20,000 people. Overflow meetings,
it Is thought, will be necessary, and if so
they will take place In a number of the
large churches in the vicinity of Me
chanics* Building. An attractive feature
of the meeting* in the big auditorium
Â¦will be the singing by trained choruses,
one serving at day sessions and the other
at the night meetings, each under its
cwn director, but supervised by the vet
eran chorus leader and singer, Ira D. j
Sankey.
Another feature cf the convention will
be B full and comprehensive exhibit of
the growth of the American associations
during tfce last half-century. Its object
will be to show the evolution of the asso
ciaticn movement and to represent the
means used and the varied character and
quality of the work done. It will contain
material from the various branches of the
iis>-cc-iation, arranged in departments, such
as historical, religious, educational, physi
tal, hoys' work, army and navy work and
miscellaneous. Interesting exhibits from
*ornÂ« of the foreign associations have al-
K.-aOy been received. Awards of merit
\vi!l be given for the be^t showings in the
various departments.
At the opening session of the convention*
addresses of welcome will be delivered
l>y leading citizens of Massachusetts, and
at the evening session of the same day a
reception will be tendered to President
McKinley, Lord Strathcona, High Com
missioner for Canada, and a number of
distinguished personages who bear greet
ings from foreign governments. During
the week there will be receptions ; to the
delegates by Governor Crane at the State
House, and under the auspices of the Bos-

LIFE OF THE UNIVERSITY
TWENTIETH century cynics who
delight in iterating the % . tart fact,
"As the men . do, so also do the.
women." "doubtless . found satisfac
tion in noting what occurred at a
meeting of the Women's University Club
in New York" recently.
- There was an attendance of abou'. sixty.
A resolution was adopted providing for an
organization to include all alumnae hav
ing degrees, with the avowed purpose of
possessing a clubhouse. Several of these
.present spoke of the good work doi e by
non-graduates and teachers who are in
cluded in the various colleg; clubs, and it
was urged that such memb.rs could bring
to a woman's university club a great deal
of enthusiasm and support, as they had
already done for the college organizations.
Â¦ Now, to any one who has hot considered
the matter, a statement of tne number of
college and fraternity club9 in the metrop
olis and the cozy and costly clubhouses
they maintain would ->be astonishing.
Within a very recent period there . have
%een a surprising number of these organi
zations consummated right in the. heart of
the city. ' â¢ .
f The erowth of club life in this new
country, and particularly ir^ New York
City, has been remarkably accentuated by
the fosmation of college dining club's and
their J ; subsequent establishment as full
fledged clubs with central and thoroughly
equipped homes.
; The flourishing. . Yale Club has' Just
moved into its new ten-story. building in
West Forty-fourth street. The Princeton
Club, which not long ago leased . a large
double house at th- corner of Park avenue
and Thirty-fourth street; and the Cornell

the St. Anthony's Club of Delta Psi.
Others which have a permanent organi
zation here, although they, have not yet
secured permanent quarters, are the Am
herst, Brown, Dartmouth, Trinity, Wil
liams, Unio.i and University" of Virginia
Alumni associations.
The new building of the Yale Club, at
Kos. 30 and 32 West Fourty-fourth street,
from. an artistic point of view -is one of
the most beautiful of its. kind extant, and
a notable, ornament to a block which has
already several clubhouses upon it.
This/ten story building, on a plat $0x105
feet,; represents an expenditure of $375,000.
The architects, Messrs. 'Tracy & Swart
wout, Yale aiumni. ; of course, are very
young men, ami their achievement in se
curing this commission and planning' a
structure so commodious . and ' artistic Is
another noteworthy. factor in the college
club life of this city. - W
-The upper and lower stories of theclub
house are faced with white marble; red
brick forming the intermediate wall. The
first floor contains the cafe, billiard*' and
visitors' rooms, and a grill "that promises
to be one of the cosiest and most distinc
tive, inv the metrbpolis. The second floor
has.a spacious lounging room and library.
On the ninth floor are the dining rooms,
private, class and general. The tenth
floor contains the kitchen, storerooms
and servants* quarters, and over this
will be a' roof garden. The remaining
floors are divided into sixty-four suites
of bachelor quarters, ranging from one
to seven or eight rooms.
The Yale Club was organized only three
years ago, with about six hundred mem
bers, yet â¢ its present club house, facing
Madison square, has been so successful
that larger quarters were found to be
necessary fully a year ago, and the
Building Committee quickly selected a
Bite,' had the requisite means pledged,
and set about erecting the new home.
The Yale Club is one of the very few
clubs of any pert whose restaurant has
shown a profit from the first. Together
i with the cafe and the cigar counter, the
profits from this cne source amounted to
about $14,000 last year.
'Yale's perennial rival. Harvard, has
been housed in its princely home just op
posite for several years, and seefns quite
as prosperous. ' The Harvard Club of
New York was organized away back in
1863, Incorporated in 1SS7, and it purchas
ed, the site of Its clubhouse In 1S92. It la

everywhere prevails, well calculated to

heart ever planted in an alumnus. The

there, are still, a few swell ones in l'aio
Alto. . i .
The Sigma Alpha, Epsilon house looks
large enough to. comfortably hold a.n e.i
tire regiment.
. The reception hall is a perfectly im
mense room, and serves all kinds of pur
poses. A four-foot or>en fireplace de
mands that the piano and music box be
there, and all kinds of easy chatrs.
The billiard room opens just off, uith
folding- doors, so the players can catch
the cheer and still enjoy their game. .
Opening from the billiard room is a cozy
spot for any one who wishes a quit-.t
hour with a book. On the other side of
the hall is the dining room, so a fellow of
moods may be happy and not "waik a
d<izen miles, either. '
The house is certainly an ideal one fcr
entertaining, as the rooms are large and
the rugs rnd chairs can be pushed back
in a jiffy.
Directly across the street from the S.
A. E.'s is the cozy home of the Kappa
Sigma boys.
Their house isn't^ large, but it's a bower
of roses outside and full of good natura
and fun inside.
Instead of having two or thrÂ«e '.ables'in
the dining room, they have one bread,
long one. and everybody sits where he
can see and "josh" the other fellow. For
there's always another fellowâ you know.
The boys are hospitable, too, and have
a charming way of . entertaining the'r
friends, or even their friends' friends.
The house is iu'.lt In a fa-shlan tftat
most of the bedrooms are dormer ones, so
their rooms are all different thanes and
ail furnished in different styles. Ttie one
thing that most of them possess is a lish
ret packed full of photos, urogrammes
and tinv odds and ends.
By the way, all the houses at Stanford
have a matron, or a house-mother, a3
they affectionately call her.
If she likes her boys she Is Indeed a
mother and . the buttons are a'.l in plate
and the toes of their socks don't "nave the
satisfaction of getting holey.
But like everything else, there â¢ are
matrons and matrons, and maybe one
reason why the Kappa Sigma fallows are
so jolly is on account of their "mother."
They all say so, anyhow.
The Deltas Tan Deltas have a roomy
house in "Palo Alto.
; Their broad veranda is almost inclosed
in roses and climbing vines and there are
shady trees that invite one to rest.
The hall is -large but isn't partlcularly
invitiry;. It's too cmr.panlh'ed ami stiff
looking. But they have the jolliest Ori
ental room just off and it's rather a sur
prise to everybody.
A card room opens on" from the -hall,
and this many colored, fascinating cor
ner opens from the card loom. A casual
caller would never dream that a room
piled high with soft pillows, draped In
dull cclcrc and filled with sweet incense
.was almost within arm's reach.
That is where the boys rest and spin
yarnsâ anc" at the same time they can
keep en pye on tho?e plaving cards.
It seems to be a trait of the Sigma Nu
tribe to i-xtend tr-.f glad hand to their
friends. They simply can't do enough to
make one's visit pleasant, and it's "can't
you rtay to dinner: we'ii be so j?5ad to
have you," or <- stay over with us."
Their htme is sandwiched in between
two "Prof.'s" homes and the chaps have
to be eternally on their good behavior.
That makes it bad in one way. but may
be that is one reason why they turn out
so many strapping athletes and point so
proudly to their picture gallery of nota

The most original looking house in all
Palo Alto is owned by the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity. It is built in the S.
style of architecture, and can be plainly
seen for blocks. â¢
While the house is swell-looking' on the
outside, it doesn't show up to such good
advantage on the inside.
There are practically three large rooms â
the hall, parlor and dining-room. While
all three open into, each other, it is next
door to impossibly to see out of one, into
another, and that means to miss half of
life in a fraternity house, or any house,

The home of the Delta Epsilor. boys
looks less like a "frat" house than any
cue at Stanford.
The snii-f looks like velvet, there are
flower?, (luwers everywhere, and even the
walk is graveled to suit the taste ot a
country squire.
The hall is large and simply furnished.
In fact. there is not one stick of furn'
rure io tl at house that looks as though
it might belong somewhere else. .
The fioov of the parlor is .covered with
one ;arge rug. pr.d that in turn is covered
with bear rugs dropped here and there.
The wa'ls are just the natural grained

they haven't a sign of one growing as

Their home must have been built with
the idea of entertaining. The hall is quite
as large as a ball-room in a private house.
The dining-room opens from it and is in
itself a good-sized room. The sideboards
are buiU in. so wnen their small 14x25

The rescuers drew back to a respectful

nobody knows how, through all the plung

right on his back and shouting triumph

ONLY COWBOY IN AMERICA WHO RIDES
A STEER
IN PREFERENCE
TO A
HORSEC. &. M, Smith.
THE MAN WHO PROCURED THE FIRST
LETTERS PATENT ON THIS COAST
S~y W. M. SMITH, who died last
I / April, was the man who procured
I /I the first letters patent on the Pa
\Ls â¢ cific Coast.
He was one of the pioneers who
played a part "in the making of California
history. His role was unique: while oth
ers were digging gold, building railroads,
bailing ships, he made his name and
made California . that' much the â¢ more a
State by his labors along the line of me
chanical inventions.
He was a Massachusetts^ man In . the
first place. .The grit of stern old Massa
chusetts was,, in, him, and he pioneered
California in much the same way .that
his forefathers had pioneered New.Kng
land. He came to make a living of it
and he succeeded. He succeeded In doing
a pood deal more besides.
He was born in 1830. It was in 18G2 that
he began to devote himself to the secur
ing of patents both for ' himself â¢> and for
other people, so he was still ,a young
man. Somehow he . seemed ' to strike
twelve the first time and from the. time
that he began it he was known ..for .his
Â¦work and he came to T>e called by; the
Commissioner of Patents at Washington
"the best agency, on the Pacific ; Coast
through which to obtain letters patent."
His name spread. It went aa far aa
Europe. People said that he .could tell
what invention was worth patenting, and
then, when it -was worth Â¦ while, get it
patented. His high reputation as a
counselor and advocate in foreign patent
cases enabled him, while in. London sev
eral years ago,' to procure a full set of
the British reports for. the Mechanics'
Institute. It is the only set on the coast
and at the present time it would be Im
possible to duplicate them. They are val
ued at $50,000. ' ' . '._ ... ' -Â¦Â¦Â¦-Â¦- ... Â¦;
jj His keen, intuitive knowledge as an in
ventor and-. his" legal acumen as'a solic
itor and patent lawyer helped hundreds
of Inventors "in perfecting .'their devices
and securing- letters patent. He not enly
had the, Inventive power, :_but the critical
as I well. ,'He knew what' would go and
what .wouldn't. Crude, , erratic attempts
often have a good idea In them when you
get down^to bedrock. He knew just how
to get'down to that bedrock and he of
ten developed a useful device out of some
young Â¦â¢ inventor's propositionâ something
which looked preposterous at first sight.
He knew, too,' when .there was nothing
in a scheme. ;, Probably* he did as'nuich
good in killing false hopes 'and destroy
ing a fool's paradise now and' then as in
helping the -right man *. on:. ..'Â¦'-.'. j
Â¦Perhaps the biggest thing ,he ever in-
vented himself was the railway coachâ
"Smith's Patent Steel Rolled Railway
Coach or Palace 'Car',' is the whole of its
name. ' This waj> the coach tha,t carried
off a medal: from the Mechanics' Insti
tute. It cost him no end of money to per
fect the 'thing, but it had been his work
of years, atri he would not give it up,
no matter what the cost. In the end he
succeeded in turning out a coach that
cannot be telescoped, broken or. burned â
a, coach that skilled engineers have said
was the coming one. ' ... . ' ; / I
Smith used to say that he didn't really
invent* that coachâ it. was his wife. -.Not
that 1 she had a mechanical' geniusâ there
isn't . one /woman in? a thousand who
knows the first thing about mechanics*
and that one's . knowledge . stops at . tlio
tucking attachment to her sewing ma
chine. â¢ But Mrs^ Smith was' the kind of
wife who helps a man In better ways
than. by understanding his craft, Â¦tihe-un
derstood him. He-used to own that his
courage would give out now and .then.
This was especially true when he was
working at the non-telescopic part of the
invention! and at these, times she would
always remind him of the progress he
had already made. â¢ â¢<Â¦". - . â¢

there, and furthermore. It was his espe
cial desire to have me perform before his
friends during this festival. For my serv
ices he would dellght-in recompensing m*.

â¢Ij. can't say that I exactly wanted to
occept. â¢ 1 was a little dazed and I didn't
feel sure' whether I was called upon to
kill tigers, and I was quite sure that was
out of my. line. But papa was in hearing
distance, and when he saw. that 1 was
hesitating he came forward and advised
me to accept. The delegation of two left
well satisfied.
On the day appointed we proceeded di
rectly to the province of Surabaya anÂ«l
there we were met f>y an escort. It was
a pretentious escort and we felt very im
portant as we were being conducted to
seats near the gamelang. â¢ They were
playing Ip the shade of a bunch of tam
arind trees which, with rows of bamboo,
grew upon every side of the open fie!d.
I At one end of the open space were some
low sheds thatched with dry grass. In
these sheds -were traps containing the
tigers to be slain. Round about the great
field were ranged bamboo stands, lightly
roofed, where spectators- were gathered
to view the torture of the beasts to be
slam for their enjoyment. These seats
were comfortably shielded from the glare
of the southern sun, not only by their
roofs but also by the spreading branches
of trees that made cool shadows." Some
of the spectators stood in front of these
seats and in their throng could be seen
here and there a huge parasol such as
the Japanese often substitute for a hat.
As we were shown to our seats, papa
and mamma were called awav bra fricna
and they left me alone, promising to re
turn, soon. I could feel at eas-3. for the
surroundings were so stfange to me. But
I tried to put on a bold front and look
as if I was used to tiger-killings. I have
been on the stage long enough to know
that you can't let go of your nerve when
a performance lies ahead.
Ihe gongs of the gamelang rang out
sharply and at this signal the whole field;
except* for a few yards in front of the
musicians, was surrounded by native
huntsmen each bearing in .his hand a
long spear.' . -: -
In frpnt of the seats, in front of the
standing spectators, these formed still
another circle. " â¢
â¢ Scores upon scores of them were ranged
there, making a complete inclosure of the
open field.'. They stood as close together
as was possible, leaving' no chance ' of
escape for the Weasts soon to be released
within' their circle. "Their Ions spears
were held ready for use, all pointed
toward the center of the tnclosure. The
men were dressed* in no uniform, but all
were in the loose, doel ' costumes of the
native huntsman. " They- were * cruel

This feat seemed to be the" secret of
my hit. It was so great a novelty that all
Kediri was deiighted. And this is what
came of it: At the door of my dressing
room I was met by one of the mantris
with an interpreter. The mantrl hold
aloft a roll of parchment and the inter
preter begged permission to read its con
tents to me. I consented. I should have
had to do so for curiosity If for nothing
else. .
Then with nompous gestures and loud
voice he read to me the wordy document:
It made known that it was the wish of
the Regent to have a fete and tiger-kill
ing exhibition â¢while we were in the coun
try. The Regent, owing to his deep -af
fection for his neighbors in the province
As the shov/ advanced the spectators
watched quietly and with close attention.
Not until I came to kneeling upon the
wire and picking up my handkerchief did
they give way to their wonder and ad
miration. Then they' let themselves loose
all at once, and I was greeted with such
shouts and yells that I was seriously rat
tled for the moment, and it was all I
could do to stand erect on the wire once
more.
tumes with gold-embroidered supper*.
When I ascended the rope ladder to my
wire I heard the confused murmur of the
excited spectators; and from my. aerial
platform I looked down upon this strange
assembly.
I saw that they were gazing upon me
in great wonder. I didn't know then that
this was prompted by anything but my
performance, but I learned afterward
that, strange as that seemed to them,
stranger still were my rose-pink legs. The
natives had never before seen tights.
The body of the house was filled with a
mixture of Europeans and natives, most
of whom wore the gay sarong or' petti
coat^ These are of colors as gorgeous' as
those of a Roman scarf. The kibaya or
loose jacket was worn by the swellest
of the women, who completed their cos-
10 gulden of Uutch money, which 13 aa I

i The boxes near the stage were occupied"
by the native "Regent" or Governor, to- Â¦

his dusky relatives, the waidonos and i
mantris, who are high court officials, and
several members of the Dutch President's
(or elder brother's) family.
tnan man, I thougnt or m&nj.
There they stood ranged and walt'Mg.
1 declare they positively looked hungry
for the b'ood of those helpless btadta
that they were waiting for. AnJ ihe peo
ple waiting for the sight were as deiight
ed and eager as Spaniards at a. ZV&l iignt.
The musicians suddenly played loudly,
sharply.
this evidently was another sisnal, for
on the instant there appeared foar bul
lock carts, each bearing a trap and LiÂ«;er,
with the -driver walking beside.
The drivers placed the traps in the cen
ter of the field and drove back to the
thatched sheds.
Four young huntsmen fan out quickly
and threw open the doors of the traps.
Then they ran as quickly back to ti'.fclr
places in the circle. *Â¦
For some minutes not a movement was
made by the animals. The spectators
were waiting in breathless suspense. At
last a head Drotruded, then another-an
otherâanother. As if drawn to it by
some enchantment, the four b'.g brutes
faced the circle of their slayers.
iFor an instant they paused as if In
doubt. Then, with a steady, stealthy trot
theymade for the human fence, all goÂ»ug
in different directions. They were run
ning straight into the death prepared lor
them.
'As they drew near the huntsmen, they
lowered their bodies and sprang. In the
moments following there was chaos. A
fearful din arose; horrible roars of agony
from 'the wounded beasts, the shoutinf of
many people, the crashing gongs of the
gamelang.
When quiet was restored and the ciowd
stood back I could see the four beaui.il.ul
beasts lying there dead. At least a dozen
wounds were in each glossy hide. That
game was over and the spectators were
ready for'the next. Again came the bul
lock carts from the thatched sheds, and
again they bore four cased tigers. Tne
traps were deposited in the field, the driv
ers loaded the dead bodies and drove off.
The new traps were opened by men who
fan back to the circle.
The tigers appeared. This time only
three made for the peoole. The
fourth seemed dazed. It stood near the
traps with lowered head. That was at
the time that the photograph on this page
was taken.
The three that had advanced were easily
made way with. The crowd was grow
ing impatient with the delay caused by
this sulkv beast. At last one of the hun
ters, bolder than the rest, approached the
stupid animal and attempted to arouse it.
It was only too easily done. Tigers
never quite sleep. By one terrific growl
it showed that it was awake and with
out a pause it rushed at the native. The
man would have escaped had not his foot
caught. He fell. With one tearing blow
from the huge paw the furious creature
slew him. The other hunters rushed In
too late.
The tiger no longer sulked. With an
other of those fearful roars that made
my blood run cold, it tore its way through
the ranks. Wounded, bleeding, terrified,
enraged, it made its way directly toward
me.
I was sick with horror by this time and
my nerve was going fast. Frightened into
weakness, I watched the thing as it drew
rear. Animals are curious about color.
This beAst was probably attracted by my
pink gown. All of this passed through my
i ~ ~ -' â *â¢Â»Â»â¢Â«''â¢ it creeping nearer.
I. grew fascinated.
I could not move. I was sitting atiil,

golden eyes, the shining teeth. I 'seemed
to be in a trance. I was conscious of no
one. nothing, save that lithe, graceful,
swaying body. I know how a bird feels
before a snake.
I realized faintly that the gamelang was
playing. That was to attract the beast's
attention. I saw the hunters rushing to
ward it. I saw my father approaching â
these things seemed hardly real. Then I
fainted. . -
When I revived papa placed me In a
seat filled with soft grass under a shade
tree and the afternoon breeze sifting
nthrough it partly restored me. I began to
remember the circumstances I had left.
"It must be time for my performance,"
I said.
"Never mind the performance." papa
answered: "You are not well enough to
give a sood one. Some other time."
I never liked to be talked to as if I was
a child, so I got very spunky, I suppose.
"I am ouite able to go on and I intend
to," I said, and I wouldn't own to myself
that I felt weak.
I ordered that the wire be stretched,
and it was done.
I dragged myself up the rope ladder and
slowly arose upon the platform. I thought
my strength would return if I went ahead,
but, to my dismay, 1 could* hardly keep
my balance. -
I tried to forget my surroundings and
looked up to prevent dizziness. Ahead oC
me I could see a distant volcano. The
sun shining on the rising smoke made It
look like fire.
I moved slowly along the wire, trying
to keep before me that picture of the vol
cano. But, try as I would, the afternoon's
experience would come to mind.
Presently the moment arrived when I
was to do the handkerchief trick. I got
down on one knee, but for the life of me
1 could not take my left foot from the
wire. ' . . -
I saw the ground below me swarming
with: tigers. I tried to count them. I
could see them crunching victims in their
ugly jaws. I wondered dimly why my
father and mother did not come to rescue
me from them. . Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ r -
I felt myself going: downâ downâ down.
When I came to myself, papa said:
"You fainted, and when I tried to catch
you you slid, through my arms, a dead
weight."
No bones were broken, but my nerves
were shattered. I was in bed for i two
weeks afterward.
I have had enough of tiger killing.

A NEW COIN WITH A HOLE IN
THE CENTER
It is the general opinion of government
officials that there is no crying need for
an additional subsidiary coin of small
value and large bulk and weight, the 5
cent..nickel piece and the copper 1-cent
piece being considered ample to meet the
wants of the people of the West. Bank
people and treasury officials have a very
lively conception of the bother there is
In handling the present 1-cent pieces, the
larger institutions getting hundreds of
pounds of them. sometimes on hand The
weight as well as bulk cuts quite a figure
In these cases, and the addition of an
other intermediate between the 5-cent
piece and the cent piece would, it Is be
lieved, but add to .this trouble. Vault
room for storage purposes and draying
facilities would have, to be provided In
proportion.
The old 3-cent silver piece which was
coined several years ago did not meet
with popular favor, and It was found Im
possible to keep it in circulation. The
sub-treasury people fear that the attempt
to put out a new one will be but a repe
tition of this experience.
In the "West and Southwest the 1-cent
piece was slower in coming into favor
than in the East, and the coinage of the
new Piece , is supposed to meet a
demand which the 5-cent piece la too
large for and the 1-cent too small. This

One rarely sees a blue orchid. Orange
and scarlet are more often fountf. but
â¢white orchids are the least rare. The
white orchids are the easiest to raise, but
require care, attention and a personal

The florist tells one that he divides his

They grow all over the world, the Ter
restrial abounding in the colder climates,
while ip the tropical regions are found
immense varieties of Epiphytal orchids.

Dr. John Milne of the seismic suction of

The orchid Is certainly the fashionable
flower, as every florist avers. To carry a
bouquet of orchids is the ambition of
every society girl who is invited to a
, swell function. The orchid is so popular
I in the East that poems are written about
j them almost every day, and what can ba
I a greater proof of fashion's favor than
this?
In Walter Malone's recently Issued
i "Songs of North and South" one 'of the
' prettiest bits of verse is:
vallias and eypridiums are the most like
ly to live after the temporary transplant
ing.
On occasions such as large receptions
and afternoon teas orchids can be made
the most effective decoration possible.
The growing plants should be left In their
own pots or baskets and permitted to fol
low their own flowing graceful habit. If
arranged in banks they should follow the
idea of the larger ones in the background
and the lesser ones toward the outer edge.
Ferns must be used with great freedom
between and among the orchld3. and as
drapery for mantels. Fringes of orchids â
the FIcus repens and Isolepis gracillsâ
make an, artistic finish. Fern fronds and
cut blossoms of the orchids may be placed
among the plants and elsewhere when the
eye sees such a need. Calanthea, with
their arching wands of pink and white
flowers, can be left with their roots on
and lightly covered with moss; they then^
have the effect of cut flowers. It does
not injure the orchid plant3 to use them
in ,thfs way, but, of course, the flowers
will not live Ions after being exposed to
such a change of temperature. Odonto
glossuma. oncl.llums. sophronltes, masde-
crchlda, nevertheless, are paid for at thÂ»
full price, for they cannot be used again.
Sometimes orchids are used In other ways,
â¢with more lavishness than the basket de
sign permits, and then their cost easily
runs up Into the thousands. t
THE shark that for two years has
been seen swimming about in one of
the wall tanks of the ground-floor
ff tier on the salt water side of the
Aquarium was recently removed to the
ampler waters of the greater central pool
to preserve its life.
In the two years in which the shark had
been in the tank it had increased in length
from two feet to about four feet eight
Inches. The ta/jk being small, the shark
could not get the exercise it required. This
made its removal necesÂ«ar?-. '
In making the transfer a serious diffi
culty was encountered. The salt water In
the shark's tank in the Aquarium Is usual
ly at 71 degrees. The water in the great
central pool Is just now about 55 on the
bottom, where the cold water supply
comes in, and about â¬0 at the top, where
the warmed water Is supplied. This would
do for such flsbes as haa wintered in it,
but it would kill in short order a shark
put Into it from water at 71 degrees and
left to itself. Â¦ Therefore when the shark
had to be removed the Aquarium people
got ready to keep it alive in the big pool
until it could look out for itself. It was
to be kept from lying down and giving: up
and succumbing to the chill by practically
the same methods followed to ward off
etupor in the case of a man who had
taken an overdose of some narcotic, name-
ly. by keeping him moving.
They shifted the shark over from {he
tank it had lived in for two years, and
dropped It in- the big pool on Friday week
at 5 p. m. Almost the moment it slid into
the pool the shark stood, literally speak
ing, on Its head, perfectly inert. . The dif
ference in the temperature of the water
would have killed it in quick time if left
to itself. But that Is Just what they didn't
do. They had a man stationed on the cop
ing of the pool with a pole and -for seven
hours this man was kept tolerably busy
keeping that shark on. the go.
The minute thT shark drooped head
downward in that fashion, just letting go
and giving right up on the spot, the man
touched it up with the pole, to get away
from which the shark would right itself
up and start swimming. i*.at was what
they wanted it to doâ to keep swimming
and swimming. -
Sometimes the shark mignt not need at
tention more than twice an hour, some
times it had to be moved every few min
utes. Once or twice it turned over on its
back, but the man was after it. quickly
spurring it on, and the shark would right
Itself at the touch and start ahead again.
And so they kept at it until midnight, by
which hour it was pretty Veil warmed up
and going nicely. *â¢ â¢

In co'se we wins, but not In just the way

leaves the Kid up on the butte, which no
cat, let alone jio,Injun, is going to climb,
'caufc he can't. Three of us scouts around
to the.Jeft.of the spring and three to the
right. The mesquite is plumb thick there
abouts, and down near the Rio the tornea
would ! hide a cavalry . regiment. I had to
crawl through that tornea and am
scratched more than a million times by
the thorns, but I ain't minding that none
In my joy at gittlng that 'Pache. 1 sees
through Billy's system plenty quick, and
I realizes that we are going to humble up
that Injun till he just dies with shame.
There ain't nothing left open for that In?
jun but the Rio, and we all know that the
quicksand is more than a guard there. We
knows it, and the Injun knows it, and it
don't figure none in our calculation. '.,
"Well, sir, when we had all crawled our
little stint Billy Boland, who picks out the
stand nearest the spring, gives one whoop
that is shore a credit to him. The way
that Injun surges out of that biiing spring
is a caution to cats. He comes out of the
stream with a plunge that makes a pitch
ing broncho discouraged. He gathers in
that gaudy headpiece and his Winchester
all in one grapple, hops over behind his
pony and is organized for war in two
shakes.
"Then I gives another whoop on the
t'other side, and he skirmishes around
thatpony just too quick. At that up rises
the Kid on the butte and shoots a mile
over him, but the effect is plenty goou.
That Injun don't 1-now where he is at. He

Caballero Mountains. If he's thinking
trouble, he don't let on none. He just sits
there straight, one hand shading his eyes,
the. other 'hanging limp where Billy gits
him in the arm. The yellow old Rio glides
past and sort of chuckles low. The quick
sands are a shaking as if they ""appreci

all stand on the bank and don't say noth

cashes in his last chip. ' .
"By and by the pony gives. a big strug
gle, a last gurgling snort, and his head
goes under. The rider is- now in mud up
to his waist. We had Pedro Chaves with
us, a shore cruel man. in breaking'a hoss.
and he sort of turns loose a few jeers in
greaser talk. , '

no Siwash. â¢ Don't you see he's' clean

in after him!' .
"But the Injun had understood the pal

around in his saddle and uses the pony's
sunken back as a purchase till he pulls
himself up. It is a hard struggle, for

raises his good arm and begins to cuss us.

that Injun sat on his pony all steaming
clean, without a single streak of red or
blue to cheer him up, he must have feit

'IFor about ten seconds he sat motion

to hurt that busted arm. But the pony

!"Drop that foolishness:' veils Biily.
'That Injun's mouth will be stopped proper

which same I don't stand none. Whose

"It looks like the sands git a fresh grip
on that pony as he sinks, and the In.iui*

his shoulders and then his neck. Did you
all ever notice how the sun droDS all sud

that Injun goes toward the last. A ripple
of the Rio washes up to his rnouih. He
hands out one last yell at u<*. starts his

then there ain't no 'Pache. but just a nifty
war bonnet floating. Billy he ropes them

"\\\ F. Henders. the Knglishman who r*-p
rcsents the London syndicate, had* come
to Hermosa to talk with the boys about
the best way to keep the thousands of
cows on whose lean flanks a heart is
burnt inside a diamond out of (he jeadly
quicksands of the Upper Rio Grande.
If it were not for these famous quick
sands the range hereabout would be a
gold mine for those English capitalists
whose cows by the thousands roam about
the pray expanse which the greasers cail
"the voyage of death." To a tenderfoot
like young Bangs, who is riding with the
outfit this year for his health and his
chuck, the waterless alkali plain which
stretches eighty miles from the mountains,
about Hermosa to the Upper Rio Grande
seems a. tough proposition. But good
cowmen like Bud Peebles know that the
gramma rrass curls flat and gray over
the clains and makes it a good enough
range if it were not for the ouesfon of
water.
Speaking plainly.it is not just water; for
New Mexican rows do not have to drink
much oftener than a camel and do not in
the least mind bunching up and galloping
thirty or forty miles for a good long suck
at the Rio Grande. But for miles the Kio
<Jrarde is lined with the most treacherous
quicksands in the world, with only now
ar.d then a hard bottom ford nr a firm
ftrip where the cows might drink in
rafety. . â¢
Wise a? are lcr.ghorns in general, they.
do not seem to learn anything about
quicksand. Many a time the boys have
rop<?d a bogged stc-^r and have nulled him
out of sure death, only to have the brute
charge them fiercely ar.d then "jihd ?n
and mire down in pretty much the same
spot from which he was rescued.
"Ten thousand cows gone in them sands
ought to knock sen?e IntA even a London
er's head." remarked Bud Peebles frank
ly as h" and the boys settled down to dis
cuss with Mr. Henders the question of
fencing In the Rio bank for forty miles,
leaving gaps only where the bank is
gravel. "Therefore I'm offering ten to one
that you all have come out to wire that
l*>etle cle Rio. There ain't no sort of use
for you all to prance 'way out here if it
ain't that a-way, seeing you fits a buggy
a hesp better than you do a saddle."
The Englishman smiled quietly and
nodded again at Fat Frank, the barkeeper
of the Burnt Brand, where the confer
ence was being held. Mr. Henders had
b.cn too often on the range to treat the
beys as if they were merely flired men.
Meaning to draw out his Justification to
the directors for spending thousands of
dollars in fencing, a course which they
frowned on, but which he had already
decided to follow, he did not tell the men
at once that he had already ordered five
oarioads of wire in Chicago on his way
West.
"Wire costs a lot by the m!le. Bud," he
remarked, as Fat Frank slammed down
tho heavy bottles 'on the bar and they all
"simmers :?ded."
"So does cows," snapped Bud. "And so
dcts men."
"How many men have been swallowed
up by those treacherous sands?" asked
Mr. Henders.
"Records don't keep well in the Terri
tory," replied the cowboy, "and there
ain't no saying for shore. But I knows
myself of a bis bunch. Plenty of them
the sands is welcome to. Gawd! What a
mess you'd git if you ever could run them
sands through a strainer T* Cows and
ponie?, greasers, Injuns, rustlers and
good square boys are as thick in them
sands us plums in a imdden*. I reckon
you'd lind a bully ole 'Pache down near
the bottom, standing plumb straight on
the back of his hoss. He went down that
a-way, waving his hand and a cussing a
passel of us boys on the bank, a-whoop
ing his death song.
"That was back in the seventies, when
ole Victoria was surging over these parts,
shooting up cowmen and greasers and
running off cows till Crook corrals him
up in the Mogollons. There was a mighty 1
fine captain that was a-biling rheuma
tism out of himself in a hot spring out
on the Rio bank beyond Las Palomas
when them 'Paches creeps up and fills
him so full of arrows that he dies right
then and there, making that healing ole
spring steam red.
"A couple of years after the captain
gits killed up in the spring six or seven
of the boys comes soft over the high
mesa above that biiing spring and looks
down to see a lone 'Pache bilir.g himself
in the hole which the Injuns had stoned
up years ago, wh&i like enough there
ain't even greasers here about. The hole
steams a plenty, and we don't see clear,
but we gits a glimpse of a nifty war
bonnet lying on the edge and a pony
staked out near by. This gives the snap
away, and we laffs fit to kill, thinking
as how it is just too. easy to win out that
Injun.
"He must have been Fhore sick, or he
ain't going to make no such careless play
as that. We creeps back on the mesa to
stake our hosses, and Billy Boland, who
is boss them days, arranges the deal.
Billy is one of the men who lifts the cap
tain out after the Injuns has made an
arrow cushion out of him.
" 'We'll make that 'Pache look like an
amateur,' says Billy. *Don"t you boys go
and get quick on the trigger. I can do
all the plugging necessary to protect our
play till It's down to cases, when you all
can place your shots according to your
individual tastes. But the thing to do
is to make that Injun feel ashamed a
whole lot. We rubs it into him as how
he ain't got squaw sense to go a biiing
himself thus careless. It's an easy win
tnat he has made a big medicine and
thinks that the spirit of the spring is rid
ing herd on him, which same is a snare
and a delusion."
"It's a terrible solemn thin^ for a
'Pache to take a bath anyhow, and I
reckon the whole procedure sort of threw
that 'Pache oft! his stride. Anyhow, there
he is a-splashing himself under that drift
ing steam, while we all is a-snlckering up
on the mesa above him. a-thlnking how
we makes good for that army captain

W., WASHINGTON, June 8.â Again the
euggestlon that the Chinese ' Indemnity
question be referred to The Hague tri
bunal for determination has been ad
vanced by the United States.
In resubmlttingr this proposition/*
United States Commissioner Rockhlll has
practically confessed that little progress
of Importance has been made In reaching
a solution of this vexatious feature of the
Chinese negotiations. In fact. It Is posi
tively known that instead of the powers
having determined upon $337,000,000 as the
amount of their claims, as has all along
been believed," they are still far from an
agreement on this point It Is also stated
that no agreement has been reached re
garding the method China shall be re-
Qulrcfl^to adopt to satisfy .the claims of
the powers.
The indemnity question may therefore
be regarded as being In the same stage it
was when its consideration first began. It
may be that some of the propose
Jto-Â«ubmit larger claims th"ari hitherto're
'ported. 1 *^he United States will strenuous
ly oppose such action. Rockhlll desired
to avoid further breakers upon which' the
1 negotiations might be wrecked by secur
ing a reference of the whole question to
The Hague.
Had. the, suggestion been adopted when
first advocated It is believed in Washing

WASHINGTON, 'June 8.-The census
office to-day issued a bulletin giving the
population "of incorporated places in the
country. The bulletin shows that there
are 10,602 such places, as compared with
7578 in 1890. v
The bulletin shows thirty-eight cities
containing. more than 100,000 people each.
Of the large v C ] ties in 1900, threeâ New
York, Chicago. and Philadelphiaâ contain
more than a million inhabitants, the same
as in 1S90, while for cities having between
500,000 and 1,000,000 inhabitants those in
1900 number three, as against one only
in 1S90." There were no cities. in 1900 con
taining between 400,000 and 500,000 inhabit
ants, but at the census of 1890 there were
three cities of. this class. On the other
hand, there aro five cities in 1900 with a
population of between 300,000 and 400,000
but in 1890 there were no cities coming
between these '.limits of population.- Of
the total number of places in the list,
almost one-half, or 4318, ' contain â¢ more â¢
than 500 people, while there are 2051 places
of between 500 and 1000. . Of the States,
Illinois leads with 930 incorporated towns

! the defense, out this morning:, after half
a dozen passes, he lunged and- pricked
M. Regis in the right forearm. The lat
ter wished to continue the duel, but. the
seconds refused to let the fight continue.
A quarrel then broke out among â¢ the
seconds and several spectators, who in
cluded the Â¦well-known fencers, Malato,
Thomeguex, Suitsbaber and others. Sev
eral challenges were exchanged, . and
finally friends succeeded in leading away
M. Regis, who was furious over the sec
onds' decision. Before he left the ground
M. Regis shouted to M. Laberdesque:
,,"I fought you to show you I was not
afraid of your sword. You are, neverthe
less, an assassin." . Â¦
M. Laberdesque promptly retorted, ask
ing the seconds to- arrange another duel.
Two other duels are also promised in
connection with the affair, one between
Malato and a journalist named Leroy, and
the other between Laberdesque's secre
tary, M. Brescher, and a journalist named
Guicher.

duel with Gerault Rathard, a writer on

About Coinage Diffi

ARMY DESIRES
A MANILA MINT
DENVER, June, 8.â The Denver Times
to-day - published an interview with
George E. Roberts, Director of the Mint,
regarding the proposition for the estab
lishment of a mint at Manila. He said:
I have heard nothing about the matter since
the adjournment of Congress, but I know that
It is recoil-ins the attention of the War .'De
partment, which is obtaining all the informa
tion possible on the subject. Army officers
seem to favor the establishment of a mint at
Manila, and an effort to substitute American
coinage for the Mexican now in general use.
There is considerable opposition to this propo
sition, however, as it ie certain that to at
tempt to push the American dollar and re
deem It Iti gold would precipitate commercial
dleturbancee that might result in disaster.
Secretary Gage Is opposed to it. and 1 am in
clined to think that this plan will not be
adopted. c . â¢ : â¢
Two plane have been proposed. The first of
these Is to establish a free Mint at Manila for
the making of a Philippine dollar inter
changeable with the Mexican dollar and re
deemable at a fixed price in gold. Under this
plan producers of silver would sell their pro
duct to establishments having trade â¢ relations
with the East, which would have it coined at
the Manila Mint and put In circulation. This
Is the plan adopted by the British Government,
Â¦which coins an Indian dollar. which is clrcur
leted from the Straits Settlements and has so
far been successful in â¢ competing with the
Mexican dollar and the rupee.
The eecond plan is to coin a "token dollar"
about the eize of the Mexican dollar with
enough lees sliver to prevent It from going
to the melting pot or out of the country, inter
changeable with the Mexican dollar and re
deemable in gold equally with Mexican coin.
This Is the plan that at the present time is
naort In favor among: those who have made a
special, vtudy. of the situation. Secretary Gage
favors the "token dollar."
An important consideration in the situation
Is that eventually the silver market will be
removed from London to this country. Lon
<Jon has the fixing- of the price to-day because
England lias control of the trade to, the
Orient and naturally supplies the greater por
tion of the circulating medium. But the trade
with this country is increasing with ereat
rapidity and the time will certainly come
when a large proportion, if not the greater
portion of the silver shipments of the world,
will be made from San Francisco. All indi
cations point in this direction. It is morally
certain that a. large and increasing proportion
of the trade with the Orient will come to this
country through our 'possession of the Phil

LOS ANGELES, June 8.â Los Angeles
has just 500 school children between the
ages of 6 and 17 'years less than was re
ported "when the I census was completed
and submitted to the County Superinten
dent. As> is customary, the census was
given to the City Board , of Education,
which, after inspecting it, sent the report
to County Superintendent of Schools J.
H. Strine. Upon this report. is. based the
apportionment' for the State' . funds for
city schools. After a careful examina
tion Mr. Strine rejected the report on the
ground that children had been counted
under 5 and over 17 years of. age.
This is a material saving to the State,
as those illegally counted would â¢ have
been entitled to draw State money at the
rate of ?500 for every seventy children.
Some of the first enumerators declare
that they received : Instructions to count
all children in a family, â¢ without . regard
to the age limit. Others are equally posi
tive that their instructions were not to
count those who were not beween 5 and
12 years of age. - " Â¦
Word was sent to the City and County
Superintendent, who informed Census
Marshal 'L-udlbw that that sort of work
must be stopped, and he promised to in
struct his men to that effect immediately.
But, in spite of this, the illegal and incor
rect work continued, although . it was a
aart of the work of the marshal to swear
in the men to take the census correctly,
according to instructions.
The question is, What were the instruc
tions the men received? Who is. respon
sible for the effort to get several hundred
dollars from the State, money which
should go to the. county districts?
When asked who was guilty of the' at
tempted steal, Mr. Strine said:
"My part, is simply to see that we get
a correct report. It is not my work to
place* the, responsibility, but I do know
that the work has been very improperly
done."

has approved the plans for
the new Catholic church to be

posite Moreland Notre Dame Academy.
The handsome new edifice will be erected
on the site of the old church, which will
be moved to the rear of the lot and prob
ably Â¦will be used as a boys' school.
Father Hassett and the members of his
parish expect to have when it is com

between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
W. H. ."Weeks of this city *is the architect,
and he estimates that the cost of the new
church, exclusive of furnishings, will be
between $35,000 and $40,000. ' When fur
nished its cost will reach $45,000.
The dimensions of the building, exclu
sive of transepts, will be 65x135 feet; the
height of the steeple 155 feet. The walls
will be of granite and pressed brick, and
the roof of slate. The seating capacity
will be 700. The English gothic style of
architecture is to predominate.

for the safety of the women and children.
The. Indians are very . hostile over the

committing some depredation. Â¦ . .
- A.Traugh, who clerks in the store of
George H. Knight' at Adin.v was. on- the
stand to-day before the Grand Jury and
testified regarding to whom he- had sold
rope during the past month. He said that
he had sold rope to a great number in
that vicinity during the past month, ' so
nothing, was gained from his testimony.
George Walker, a brother of H. S.
Walker, who was â¢ killed at â¢ Adln a short
time ago. is a clerk In the : Copp - store at
Adin, and "his testimony also pertained to (
the selling of rope, but was unproductive'
ofany clew. . .< ... .^ - - ..
Those witnesses who have testified have
been excused from the -county seat.: sub
ject to call. If, all the witnesses present
be examined it -willttake six weeks to
complete the investigation.
The Grand Jury has heard the testimony
of the four guards â Constable- Ervin Car
penter, James Brown, Sidney Goyette and
Richard Nicholsâ who -had charge of the
Halls and YantJs: The accounts given by
these officers at' the Coroner's inquest
have not heretofore â¢â¢' been Â¦< made public.
That of Deputy Constable Goyette was
as follows: '. â¢ . - - . .
I had just got out of bed to take. my. shift as
.guard and had only been sitting: there about
fifteen minutes when, without a word; or any
noise, the door flew open and a crowd of masked
men entered, with rifles and pistols drawn, and
ordered Jim Brown, ' the other guard, and my
self to throw up our hands, which we did. The
prisoners were all aeleeo and there was very
little, if any noise, made. I started once to
look at the proceedings, when one of the mob
placed his rifle in my face and motioned me
away, and the other guard was hot allowed to
witness what was going on either. The only
noise we heard was the cry, "Oh! Oh!" from
one of the prisoners, which awakened the occu
pants, of the house and most of them came, down
to theVroom, and .there was then a little com
motion. . .. . *> -.-
Mr. Myers, the proprietor of the house, who
is also a Justice of the Peace, said, "Get out
of here, you â : â â ' ; , -or I will shoot- you!
You are scaring my family to death!" " Mr.
Myers looked for his gun, but it was not where
it had been left.
We could not see whether the prisoners were
gagged or led out of the house with . the- ropes
around their necks or not, as we- were not al
lowed to get close enough to see. The prisoners
were led down to the bridge as if being led by
the arms, with a man on each side. Two men
were left to take care of we two guards and we
went, along for some distance In this manner,
when the men with - us suddenly left us and
went on up in front with the rest of the mob.
whereupon Brown and myself ran back to
Lookout. We did rot witness the hanging. We
did not see the mob return and get Calvin Hall,
which they afterward did." They did not take
him the first time, as he was asleep in an ad-
Joining room.
Ths testimony of the other guards was
practically the same as that of Goyette.

LOOKOUT MEN
SHY ON FACTS
The men took the direction of Phoenix,
but although parties of armed men left
both that town and Eholt during the day
in search of them they have apparently
succeeded in getting away.
The train came to a dead stop just as
one of the men sprang into the cab and
covered both engineer and fireman with
revolvers. The other men started back
along the train, but as it was at the edge
of a gulch their progress was slow.
The train crev^took the alarm and made
a run to head off the robbers. The latter
could not move along rapidly and keep
their men covered at the same time, so
they backed to the front of the engine
and made a dash for the bushes. Con
ductor Halfpenny fired several shots in
their direction, but none took effect.
Engineer Lafayette says that he first
noticed the three men standing near the
track and signaling him to stop. In the
mountain country this is a common oc
currence and the accommodation trains,
if they are not running too fast, will stop
at any place* There was nothing sus
picious about the men as they waved a
lantern, but the engineer was too far
away to see their faces. '

and John T. W'ooten of Selma, who has in
terests at Midway, have been ambled in
connection with the. Midway shooting on
April 13 last. Dr. A. F. Schaefer. County
Physician, charged with complicity in the
midnight assault on G. P. Cornell and J.
r. ualker. surrendered himself to-duv
and was released on $2000 bail. LSesiaeV.
Schaefer. Boust, Wooten and Donelly, tne
latter of whom was arrested vesterday.
the warrant includes the following: J. A.
Cnanslor and J. \\\ Jameson ot" Los Ange
les. H. P. Anderson, William Hendry.
Charles Hall, H. C. Fertig. John M. Don
ley. Sam J. Dunlap, Charles Todd, George
L. Berger. O. A. Keal, F.'E. Manuel, Fred
Price, John Doe Jackson and eight mem
bers of the Doe family.
Although George Walker was seriously
Â¦wounded on the night of the battle, the
complaint merely refers to the injury to
Cornell, as the investigation has proceeded
and was carried through at the instigation
or Cornell Sr.. who is reputed to be one of
Â¦wealthiest mining- men of Plumas County.
The arrested men have been released on
bonds in the sum of 52000 each.
In all probability the criminal proceed
ings will be under, the laws governing con
spiracy. It Is generally believed that the
prosecution will not attempt to hold the
men individually responsible for the shoot
ing, but that they will be charged collect
ively with a conspiracy, which is said to
nave led up to the serious trouble and
almost cost two men their lives. Further
arrests of prominent business and profes
sional men are expected to-morrow.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Charge of Conspiracy Will
Be Preferred Against the
Suspects.

These plants seem to partake of the nature and character of the I^tt .l : yl^fe
serpent; in winter time being- comparatively harmless, but when warmed
into life by spring and summer heat they become extremely venomous
and spiteful, emitting a milky juice that burns and blisters like a fiery
acid, producing quick inflammation and painful swelling. Some persons W^^IWilSs
are so susceptible to these vegetable poisons that coming in their vicinity MmwW^M
will produce almost as much discomfort and pain as handling them; '&%MnW^^^SÂ»
their thin and sensitive skins seem to absorb from the surrounding
atmosphere the acrid juices emanating from these plants. There is
seldom a picnic or family gathering in the woods but that some mem- W^0$M?zW*^

to the overheated blood. Poison Ivy is found clinging to tree trunks, *

In the' courtroom Mrs. Kennedy occu
pies a chair. at a table with her, attor
neys; and about her daily are grouped her
father, her mother, who visited the pris
oner but once since her arrest; her "mar
ried sister, Mrs. Leon, and the latter's
husband. Frequently during a whole ses
sion of court her relatives pay-no atten
tion to her. To-day when Mrs. Kennedy
grave vent to her feelings in , sobbing her
father tried to quiet her, but Mrs. Prince
and Mrs. Leon remained in their seats,
making no effort to comfort the woman.
-William T. Hacker told of seeing Mrs.
Kennedy and Bert Prince together in the
vicinity of Kennedy's office a few hours
before the murder, and Clifford Lawson
Itestified to having seen Prince there at
about the same time with a woman whom
he did not know. Â¦ ''Â¦";Â¦ â¢Â¦â¢'.'Â¦
Charles Dittmlr testified to Bert Prince
having forecasted the murder. Two days
before the killing occurred Dittmlr said
Prince accosted him while he was. read
ing a newspaper account of Kennedy's
suit for annulment of the. marriage.
Prince remarked:
"You'll read worse than that about him
before long:.' 1 - . '
"I told him, 11 said Miss .Litchfleld, "that
I had been downstairs; that some one had
been hurt. Bert said: 'L-ulu did it; she
gave him what was coming to him. 1 He
did not Â¦ treat her right and she fixed
him.' " . â¢â¢..;Â¦;
Miss Litchfield to-day testified to hav
ing seen Bert Prince oa the floor above
Kennedy's office a moment after the
sheeting 1 . â¢
' The theory of. the State . is that: Bert
Prince, together with his brother : Will
and his father, C. W. , Prince, all of whom
are awaiting trial on a charge of com
plicity In the murder, had conspired with
Mrs. Kennedy to kill Kennedy, and that
the male members of the family were
present in the building watching -the dif
ferent entrances to prevent his escape.
KANSAS CITY, June 8.â Lulu ; Prlnoe-
Kernedy cried convulsively, in. the court
rccm this morning when a witness testi
fied to a conversation held with the pris
oner's favorite, brother, Bert Prince, a
few minutes after the killing of Kennedy.
Mrs. Kennedy was removed" from \ the
room in an effort to comfort her, but
when she was brought back a few min
utes later she sobbed aloud, and finally
collapsed utterly. Unable to proceed with
the trial, Judge Wofford ordered an ad
journment until Monday' morning, and
the prisoner, moaning 1 and crying: .aloud,
was carried bodily across the j corridor to
her cell. Â¦', "â¢ , v '.-/ ; :.Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦>-,- '. /'Â¦Â¦"Â¦.
*This. was. the first real sign of a break
down the prisoner has displayed Bince the
killing: 'Â¦Â¦ in January last, thÂ© cool attitude
and apparently, careless bearing she has
shown having completely puzzled the offi
cers who had her in their care.
Miss Bertie Ldtchfield, a former school
mate of Bert Prince,' was on the stand,
resuming: her testimony of yesterday. She
had told of Prince being in the Ridge
building at the time of the murder, and
of his conversation -with her. The defense
had objected to " this conversation being
related, and Judge Wofford reserved his
decision until to-day, ' announcing this
morning that the State would be.permit
ted to giye the testimony.

I SAN JOSE, June 8.â The directors of
the Calif ornla ' Cured Fruit Association
held a meeting to-day to discuss plans for
handling the coming year's crop. Presi
dent Bond outlined a policy to be pursued
and modifications to the packers' contract
were considered, but the directors refused
to divulge just what was done. .
President Bond and Vice President- H.,
W. Meek were re-elected by the directors,'

bers would not stand the test in court L.
P. Graham and P. N. Woods were re
elected to - the executive committee, the
other members being the president and
vice president. Woods is also treasurer, and
Alfred Barstow was re-elected secretary.
The compensation of the executive com
mittee, which has been $300 a month each,
was changed by the directors to $10 a day
for each, member for the actual days of
service. Â¦ Â¦ ..
/With 65,000,000 pounds of prunes on hand,
from last year and as the present crop
will not amount to more than this, Presi
dent Bond believes the association will bÂ«
master of the market and that outside
growers can be forced into the associa
tion by reducing the prices of prunes If
need be.
The California Packers' Company,
which has a contract, to sell the fruit of
the Cured Fruit Association, to-day elect
ed the following directors: W. M. Grif

Silver Creek Quicksilver Mine,
Santa Clara County.
Both mines are under one management and
ownership. Now taking out ore that goes from
â¢12 to J^jO per ton. Ore eaoush taken out and
developed in both mines to run furnaces for
ever three years. We own 504 acres of land
all paid for and title perfect, U. S. patent and
Imve had twenty years' experience in quicksil-
ver minim:. We have hoisting works, black-
smith shops, bunk houses, boarding houses and
bams, all kinds of mining machinery and tools,
teams; a shaft down at the Bradford 260 ft. in
ere, and the largest ledge in any country; then
we have about 5000 ft. of tunnels and 10C0 cords
r>t wood, cut for the furnaces, and at Silver
Creek e !argÂ« Scott tile furnace is nearly com--
X>lcted at a cost of 110.000. and -we want to
erect another one immediately at the Bradford
mine, so we offer the balance of the treasury
etock for this purpose for a Bhort time only at
75c per share for Silver Creek and SOc for Brad-
ford. No nock sold unless equal amount in
each Is taken, and we guarantee that Silver
Creek ciock will advance inside of 30 days on
fon'.jJfclion of furnace, * and if as good a mine
as the Almaden Is actually worth $200 per
share. H. 11. BRADFORD,

liicliiSfiiiWhat gorgeous dressing .was there 'at
Mrs. â¢ Martin's luncheon in honor of Mary
Scott. . I never saw the girls look so well
â¢ â¢ ' â¢
. Never was there a ' family more united
than* the Tevis family; never did brothers
show such Â¦ decided preferment for each,
other's society, j I am sorry for Mrs. Tev
is, the mother, Mrs. Tevis, the widow,
and his two loving brothers, Dr. Harry
and Will." But most of all I am sorry for.
his little 8-year-old daughter. I shall
never forget how she clung to' him ' and
sobbed when she kissed him good-by as
he went sailing away on his fateful jour
ney. Only 8 'years old. Could one call it
presentiment?. : 'Â¦â¢ vV-
Never .has sympathy been so generally
extended as to the bereaved members of
his family. Hearts have gone out to the
fair young x widow,'_ to his little " orphan
daughter, to his devoted â¢ brothers, but
most of all to hts tender, loving mother,
who on account of recent ill health is but
poorly â prepared to meet such a severe
shock. '.-
What a tragedy is Hugh Tevis' sudden
death! â¢
'Miss Dillon's house has not got much
further than the prepared plans as yet. It
is a magnificent lot, though, that Miss Dil
lon has purchased and I feel confident the
home to be erected upon it Â¦will be Â¦worthy
of the generous and hospitable young hos
tess who Is to occupy It.
People are making pilgrimages to the
vicinity of Washington and Franklin
streets to look upon the magnificent con
servatory that is to be the wonder of the
Dlngee house. Just imagine a ball in that
splendid home and a stroll in that mag
nificent" conservatory t ablaze with elec
tricity. \ i
The Flood mansion is now nearly ready
for occupancy. .The Japanese room, I un
derstand, is to be one of. the most beauti
ful in the house. â¢ The walls are all to be
upholstered in bamboo and the room is to
be stocked with the many art treasures
and rich fabrics the Floods brought with
them on their return from the Orient.
â¢ The Floods, the Spreckelses, the Din
gees, Miss Dillon and the Buckbees are all
famous for their ge'nerous hospitality, and
the homes they are shortly to occupy all
show evidence that they . have been built
to entertain.
" This' Is the way I reason: The Flood
mansion will be finished '. and | occupied.
The Dingees will be in their new house.
Miss Kate May Dillon and her. parents,
Mr. -and - Mrs. Maurice Casey, will have
moved into the elegant mansion that Miss
Dillon is preparing to erect out on Broad
waj\ John D. Spreckels. his charming
wife and fetching daughters will probably
be dispensing . hospitality In - their
palace, .and Mr. and Mrs. Sam Buckbeo
will in all likelihood be occupying the
home now building for. them out on Pacific
avenue. ' Â¦ . Â¦ . Â¦
I AM going to turn prophet even in my
own country and predict that there
will be more elegant home entertain
ments Â¦ next season than we have en-
Joyed â well, for . years and years. I
Â£ave no authority for making this state
ment. | I am simply making deductions and
drawing* my own conclusions.

McMullin. She simply looked stunning in
a gown of clinging white crepe. Miss
Alice Hager's gown. I thought, was the
handsomest of all. It was of blue panne
satin and immensely becoming to its
wearer. Miss Hager's hat was fully
worthy of her elegant gown. It was of
blue tulle, with a long blue plume for its
only trimming.
More white dresses were worn at tha
luicheon than I have ever seen before.
Mrs. Will Taylor. Mrs. Gus Taylor and
Miss Georgiana Hopkins were all dressed
in spotless white and, as usual, looked
stut-nlng.
My! but Mrs. Martin did have her ta
bles decorated attractively. The decora
tors showed rare good sense in using
blossoms that were beautiful without be
ing fragrant. The perfume of flowers
often becomes overpowering in a crowded
rcom.
There was considerable discussion as to
which, was the most beautiful of all the
four gorgeously arrayed tables. For my
taste, I preferred the heartsease table,
although I must confess that it did not
light up as well as the tables . decorated
in lishter blossoms. However, It cer
tainly was the most gorgeous table dec
oration that it has ever been my good for
tune to see.

Spilling from a dark brown basket, yel
low-faced pansies fell | over the sunny
damask into a cool bed of maidenhair
fern and outlining this exquisite center
piece were trailing branches of deep pur
ple clematis. The effect was enchanting
ly artistic. -
I thought that^the prettiest compliment
Mrs. Martin paid to Mrs. Scott was tha
placing of .her photograph on the gor
geous table that occupies the place of
honor in the center of the magnificent ;
drawing-room. There; is nothing small In
this, the truly "company" room, in Mrs.
Martin's home. There are no little blt3
of bric-a-brac to take the eyes from tha
vast , beauties of the apartment. It is
easy to imagine that Miss Scott's photo
graph. In Its delicate silver frame, at
once caught the attentionâ and held It.
Of course. Walter's picture stood along
side of Mary's.
The prettiest thing I saw at Mrs. Mar
tin's luncheon were Ruth McNutf s pretty
little Â¦ feet encased in dainty low shoes
with high red heels and steel buckles.
It Is almost decided that we shall have
another double opera season this year,
and certainly decided that the usual
grand opera season at the Tivoll will be
given, beginning on the regular date in
August. The plans for the season are al
ready almost matured, the singers secured
and the repertoire arranged. Among ord
favorites to appear will be Salassa, Colla
marini, Ferrari, Repetto, Barbarcschi,
Riisso, Polettini, Castellano and Nicolini,
and some important additions to the com
pany have been made. Linda Montanari,
whose Mimi-in that first memorable per
formance of "La Boheme" at the Califor
nia Theater is so pleasantly remembered,
Â¦will be one of the principal sopranos, and
another favorite of that charming and
pathetic performance, Agostini, has also
been secured. Two thus, Montnari and
Agostini. come to us as legacies from the
Del Conti company, and though "La Bo
heme" may not be given, other operas in
which these excellent singers have full
scope for their talents are on the season's
repertoire. Another very welcome addi
tion to the company is Signor Lada, the
fine basso who was heard on the one and
only occasion when San Francisco had the
pleasure of listening to Madame Sem
brlch. /
"The best grand opera for the money
that I have seen in any city either here
or in Europe," was the verdict of Maurice
Grau last - year after a visit to our little
opera-house on Eddy street. Mr. Grau
was not alone In his commendation. Al
most all the members of his splendid com
pany at one or another time found them
selves at the rival opera-shop, especially
on Salassa nights, and added generously
to the volume of applause.

Now a last word to students who look with
longing eyes toward a foreign stage career.
Be sure that the. voice is very unusual and
perfectly trained. Discipline the mind by se
vere study of some kind. I studied law and it
has proved the best thing I could have done
for my career. Test well your power Â«to suf
fer all kinds of humiliation and endure all
hardships. Have a well filled purse and a
bank account upon which to draw constantly.
Be prepared to work like a horse and be
treated like a stray dog. Kill all fine feeling:
and high ideals, harden your heart against
all affections, and then come over here and
go on the stage.

PRIMA DONNA SOPRANO "WHO
WILL. APPEAR AT THE TIV
OLI.
my, notice every year, and I know that the
time has come for a new style of composi
tion which shall cleverly, combine the mod
ern with the old Italian school. Then colo
ratura singing will- be comething more than a
mere exhibition of vocal pyrotechnics. There
will be a depth iri the Composition that will
demand, a corresponding expression of depth
in the voice. Demand creates a supply. With
the compositions .will come the voices.
â¢ â¢ â¢ . .
The next serious mistake Is made when the
finger is already launched on her career and
this is not entirely the artist's fault I refer
to the style of music to be euriK. It Is a fact
which any one who has studied the situation
as I am doing can verify that throughout
Germany the voices are In a wretched condi
tion, owing to the vocal demands of the Wag
ner rnuKic. The Wagner Fingers here at thÂ»
Royal Opera are good examples of the evil
Influence of this master of evil suggestion in
music. Richard Wa ff ner. The elngerR merely
Bcrestm. Now thin is not art, am' I under
stand the term. Tet singers with a certain
type of voice are limited in their vocal choice
to Wagner music or bad imitations of the
master, because of the lack of compositions
which combine the grace of the Italian school
with the deeper character oft the modern
If a voice possesses great range and light
ness, with power hardly equal to Wagner de
mands, and yet more than necessary for ef
fective coloratura work, the singer is com
pellÂ»>d to confine herself to -the Italian works
which are far too trivial ror the tastes of
thlff ape. . .'.--â¢ -Â¦
The roexzo-soprano Is also in a dilemma
The classical compositions are either too
heavy for the health of her voice or too light
In character to give full scope to her abil
ities. I have experienced this difficulty my
self during several years, conscientiously learn
ing hundreds of new songs, only to throw
them aside as unworthy the effort. The light
er works are devoid of grace and depth and
the heavier oneÂ» are generally without melody
or refinement.
Naturally, the fault lie* In the temperament
of the composer. .We do not find elegance,
delicacy or grace In the average German
mind, and the solid, restful and plow â¢ traits
of the German are generally lacking In the
Italian. That the American possesses some
thing of . both should keep him to the ideal
temperament, only, unfortunately, he has too
little ofcither. â¢ ' â¢ â¢ -
Hundreds of new compositions come under
The next mistake Is made by the artists before
their debuts, or oa their visits to an opera
house as "gueEtsJ' They positively fear and
epeak in hushed voices of the critics, those poor
fellows who have to write for the bread that
keeps them- alive, and who. In many cases, are
no more capable of writing upon the merits of
a einger than they are able to decide whether
the moon has an atmosphere or not. Or, to be
less dignified, but more expressive, "they don't
know a bar of music from a bar of soap," as I
heard an American cay. Singers fall down and
â¢worship these gentlemen, who listen for fifteen
minutes to a three-hour performance and then
instruct the public as to the opinion it ehould
hold regarding that performance.
The mistake lies In not placing the ability
Â»snd power of the critic at its true value Once
they are forced to criticize properly they ex
pos** their ignorance, which Is beautifully cov
ered by phruses about intonation, quality, ex
pression and action. There is no danger In
these expressions. The water only begins to be
deep when the article attempts to discuss vocal
causes and effects. From these subjects our
critics steer their boscts very carefully. The
plain fact is that of all subjects the male critic
Is weakest on vocal art when It is expressed by
a woman, and singers phouM realize that this
cannon ball rushing toward them in their strug
gles for fame is nothing worse than a soap bub
ble, which will break harmless asainst the
material of true merit.
The next great mistake, so noticeable here
among American students, is- the evident crate
for an operatic engagement,' to be gained at all
costs, and the shame of returning to their own
land without having accomplished something
"professional." This latter result Is so feared
that students who have voices arid' talents
which can never make them anything above a
mere stage drudge sign contracts for engage
ments In small, unheard of towns, with the
certainty of wretched living and poor pay, and
all for the pleasure of seeing the announcement
of the engagements in the home papers. The
contract* are rarely for less than five years,
â¢with two months* vacation in summer, and the
salaries are laughable, something to astonish
Americans. Furthermore, outside of royal
opera-houses, each artist must buy her own
costumes, and this on her salary is absolutely
impossible.
After the notices of the singer's engagement
have lost their exhilarating effect upon the art
itt and her friends she realizes that she must
King three roles before her contract is made
complete, and that then the director may dis
miss her if he wishes so to do. Even if re
tained she is bound in a position which yields
no fame and little true artistic experience, and
wears out the voice. The whole miserable ex
perience would have yielded but a stray notice
In the American papers. That is all. The fear
of ridicule Is all that really prevents hundreds
of students here now from fleeing to their
American homes. Better any position at home
in a ctorr than an engagement at a small
opera-houte in Euroue.
IN a recent Issue of the New York
Herald appeared an article on the
American student abroad that has
created the widest Interest in Eastern
musical circles. The article in ques
tion Is by Mrs. Alma Webster Powell,
L.L.B.. an American, and now a mem
ber of the Royal Berlin Opera Company.
Mrs. Powell's letter Is of particular inter
est to the singer, and is here given almost
in Its entirety, for what it Is worth. As
a -result of her legal education Mrs.
Powell's account should possess a strong
evidential value, and though her facts are
staled from a persistently gloomy stand
point, it Is to be feared that the situation
has not been exaggerated:
To the Editor of the Heraldâ Standing, as I
am at present, at a point in my career which,
while much higher elevation Is possible. Is yet
high enourh to rive me a clear view of the
Â¦u-retcbed mistakes made by singers In their
scramble for fame. I desire to give to student*
the result of my observations as -an American
s-inrer abroad, who w-as obliged, to make an
American reputation rest upon European suc
cess. In every opera-house are to be found un
happy specimens of singers who started their j
careers before they were fitted to leave the stu- ,
dio. Worn-out voices, careless execution, lost
artistic Ideals and throat trouble are the results
of unripe beginnings.

GEORGIA has reason to be proud of having in - her service such an official as Sheriff
Joseph Merrill of Carrollton, who,,for .the- purpose of defending a negro committed to his
charge, fired upon a mob; of lynchersand ''dispersed them.
The attack was of a nature that put a supreme test upon the Sheriff's courage and
fidelity to duty. The negro prisoner had been convicted of the murder of a white boy and sen
tenced to be hanged. Upon the day appointed for the execution a ; reprieve was obtained by an
appeal to the Supreme Court,' and the mob that had gathered to witness- the execution was ren
dered furious by being balked of its victim. It was easy in such a crowd to raise the cry for lyrlch :
law and start an attack upon the jail; but it was not easy for the Sheriff to face the danger.'; Pop
ular sentiment in Georgia is not averse to' lynching negroes who are , but â¢ suspected of crime, and
therefore it was inevitable that the mob in this case should have looked for no more -than, a formal â¢
opposition to the attempt to lynch one who had been tried and convicted. Tlie mob, however, was â¢
mistaken. The. Sheriff. of Garrollton is an officer who knows his ; .dirty and has the courage to fulfill
it. He warned the assailants to retire, and when in* defiance they broke into the jail he .fired upon
the leaders, killing one and wounding, two, driving the others back., vindicating the law and doing
much to redeem Georgia from the stain vvhich<so many recent lynchings have put upon her civil
Â¦ ization. ' Â¦.'.Â¦Â¦'> ' â¢Â¦,.Â¦..â¢ 'Â¦.Â¦:'''Â¦Â¦: 'Â¦'-'Â¦ -'./Â¦';. â¢ : Â¦"â¢.;'.'Â¦Â¦' ' '...' : 'â¢Â¦Â¦/: ;Â¦'-,. : '\
When officials fail in the performance of duty.in '-the'; face of" mob. violence, the country is .

and honor those who do not fail. Moreover '"from â¢â¢the; rapidity with. which one lynching follows 1 an ':
other in all parts of the Union it is evident the time when the faithful and the brave who uphold
the law against the violence of mobs should have the recognition due to rrieh'who;merit the honor
of their countrymen *by the noble performance, of dangerous - duty. Sheriff Merrill :has^served his i

THE RIGHT "KIND OF .SHERIFF.
What is called "nature study" is finding a place in our school curriculum, and it offers a
chance to teach children how plants grow, to develop their appreciation of the form and sym
metry of a tree, and cause them to desist from harming it,as they .would if it .were animate and its
sap were the warm blood of life. " ' .'. ". / :
Proper training in these few essentials of good manners and , good -order is a legitimate
function of a school, and it enters largely into the future character of the young.

But little official-watchfulness is needed in a public picture gallery, park, garden or" private
grounds to which the public has access,. on the Continent,' to prevent depredations. The people
of all classes enjoy the privileges given by these things and have no desire to mar or destroy them.
It should be so everywhere,' and can be made the habit here if the young be early trained in
proper respect for the rights of others. : ,
In Oakland, when the- subject Jpf tree planting' on the streets was discussed, a movement
started for planting palms, which give' an interesting and. useful Oriental -air to the streets of a
city. Palms are costly, but. large numbers of them were planted/when it soon, appeared that on
streets leading from schoolhouses the passing pupils jumped over them, broke their leaves and
otherwise defaced and destroyed them, # to the loss and injury of the property-owners who planted
them and to the defacement rather than ornamentation of the streets! This again is thoughtless
ness and is corrigible by proper admonition in the schoolroom. .
It must be admitted that in regard to the' respect shown, for /public monuments, objects of
art and street adornments the people of Europe are ahead of us. i ,Â¦Â¦-
ALL of the schools, public and private, are now in vacation for the summer, and the pupils
are returned to the all day care of their parents. When the schools reopen the young
people will return to be in charge of teachers during the /greater part of the day>v- As ; a '>'
subject of interest to both parents and teachers we beg^to suggest the matter of manners,
of street manners especially. In this city pupils'ride on the street cars at a reduced fare,: and- they
use the privilege extensively, on botlvjthe shorthand long haul. -'It is complained, by business men,
workmen and aged people that at certain hours of- the day, the street cars are so crowded by chil
dren that the old and infirm and the tired cannot get seats; and that the children .are so careful of
their half-fare privilege that they do' not make room : for; the classes of passengers who are entitled
to,. and usually receive, the polite consideration of their fellow- travelers. This is a thoughtlessness
that is susceptible of correction by home counsel and admonition in the schoolroom. ' The young
need only to have their attention called tcx.it and they will not be longer in fault ir> that respect.
Our schoolteachers should impress the necessity of respecting the- rights of others on the street.
A MATTER OF MANNERS.
BY BLANCHE PARTINGTON. -
Railroading is, in a large sense, an exact science. That is to say its success depends upon
the economic application to' art of so much that science has determined that it is the most exact of
the arts. The best technical skill is employed in it. - Everything, from the water in the engine
boiler, the fuel that converts it into steam, to the relation of traction to grade, is the subject of the
closest study. Where a facility finds its greatest profitable use, there it is safe tosay that its con
ditions receive the closest study. The United States, with the 'greatest railway mileage in the
world, and until the completion of the Russian-Pacific road the longest lines in the world, ?nd
carrying the greatest tonnage at the lowest rate in the world, ir> in the very nature of things the
field in which to expect the closest technical attention to the very details in which the British en
gineers claim that we are lacking. It is believed' here that we _ are able to pay the highest railr
way wages in the world to nearly a million employes, and at the same time give the lowest freight
and passenger rates in the world, by reason of our study and application of scientific economy in
operation. . * ',...â¢
We must therefore be permitted to maintain an interrogative attitude upon this issue raised
against us in London. Every operating department of a railroad in this country knows the energy
potential in the fuel it uses and the percentage of loss thereof in its transmission into power by the
locomotive. To reduce that percentage, of loss has been the study of the builders of engines here and
in Europe. The principle of expansion has been appliedwherever possible, and there is little room
for doubting that the American steam engine, stationary, locomotive and marine, 'has' reached as
high efficiency as any in the world. Its efficiency is a leading and necessary element in the chaep
ness of American freights andJares. The first consideration on a completed railway is the power
and its economies.
We are inclined to believe that our British critics have omitted something from their calcu
lation that is essential to its correctness. '-â¢â¢'â¢.'..
These vices of our railway engines are stated in great detail. But one who reads the im
peachment should not be discouraged, for it is in order to inquire what advantages our engines
possess to offset the serious disadvantages complained of and still, leave them so much ahead of the
English engine as to give them the preference in the judgment of English railway officers in India
and Egypt. Upon the face of the case Â«as presented by the British experts, instead of pointing
out the defects in our machine they should be soberly considering the greater defects in their own
which leave it still inferior to ours, admitting that'ours has the alleged infirmities. .
It is charged ttiat our engines .wear out too quickly; 1 that they burn more coal per mile
traveled and ton hauled than the English product; and that there is not a proper adjustment' of
the weight of metal used in their several parts to the work done or strain borne by such parts.
The technical engineers and manufacturers are picking* flaws in those things which we boast
as special examples of our superior skill. The first thing impeached is the American locomotive
and the next is the American bridge: . Both. have 'made their Way into India and Egypt, and it is
complained that the authorities representing Great Britain. in those parts are unwilling to admit
the structural infirmities observed by English engineers, and they are' charged Ayith screening the
Americans, to the detriment of the manufacturing reputation of their own country.

ury of the Hollister Development - Com
pany, together with $200o to be subscribed,
will be expended in sinking a trial well
with a standard rig to be leased Irom the
San Benito Company at $5 per day. The
$2000 to be subscribed will purchase.shares
of the Hollister Development Company at
the rate of two and a half cents per share.
No well shall be started until the $2000 is
in hand and all subscriptions are con

within ten days from June 5, 1901.
. New Refinery Planned.
A scheme is on foot for the building of
a relinery equal to the best in' the State,
I to be located either in Bakerstteld or in
I Kern City. Several oil companies have
I had . the matter under consideration for
I some time, and the Bakerstteld Calif or
nian says that the plans are about com
pleted and that steps will soon be taken
for the purchase of property for a site
upon which to locate the machinery.
Overtures have been made for a tract of
land lying between the Santa Fe . Rail
! road and the tracks of the Southern Pa
cific Company in Kern City, and the
chances are that the refinery will be erect
ed there. The McWhorter Company has
proved conclusively that the distillate and
asphaltum can be readily disposed of and
that the establishment of a refinery will
be a paying proposition. The parties in
terested in tne project -are some of the
leading oil companies and financiers of
Kern County.
A meeting of the miners and claim own
ers that was called in Bakersfield'to take
concerted action to protect their inter
ests under the mining laws has been post
poned until June 15 because there were so
few present at the date originally set for
taking the matter under formal considera
tion.
Still Locating Deserts.
There are now between 1700 and 1800 pro
ducing oil wells in the State of California,
of which about one-half are in the Los
Angeles field. To this must, be added 632
wells drilling and 221 rigs awaiting drill-
Ing operations.
The Riverside Enterprise gives some ac
count of the excitement over the location
of desert 'claims- for oil as observed in
Riverside substantially as follows:
A new Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦ company has 'been ''formed for
the purpose , of locating some of the
promising land and , a crew of men will
be dispatched out there for the purpose of
doing the locating work. This company is com
posed largely of laboring men, among the num
ber being several members of the Fire Depart
ment. PuEh, who is well acquainted with the
ground, and who also knows well the land still
open for location, will have charge of the work
for the new company. The other company of
Riverside capitalists, who have just located
something like 8000 acres of the land, will hold
a meeting for the purpose of taking steps look
ing to the commencement at, once of develop
ment work. It Is their Intention to put down
a trial well Just as soon as the tools and neces
sary outfit can be got on the ground. As
the company is made up of men who have
plenty of means, their decision to go ahead and
demonstrate the value of the property means
that ere long it will be known whether the new
field is a valuable one or not. One thing is
certain, the new field has created no little in
terest among those who would speculate in oil,
and the chances are that berore the summer is
far advanced there will be many more than one
or two well drilling rigs In operation.
Sunset District Railroad.
The railroad to the Sunset district is
making rapid progress. The road has
been graded for fifteen miles from Gos
ford on the main line and about one-half
of the rails for that distance have been
provided. The outlook is that the line
will be completed next month vunless it
is decided to continue into the Midway
field,- and there is a strong pressure to
have the line so extended.
There has been a large slump in the
prices of oil shares in Los Angeles since
a year sago. The Los Angeles Times
makes Â¦ some comparisons which show
that Westlake has gone down from 72
cents to 16 cents, Central from $1 47 to
$1 12, Alpha from 31 cents to 13 cents, Un
cle Sam from 58 to 4 cents, etc. Two
stocks have made an advance, these be
ing Continental, which has gone from 86
cents to $105, and United Petroleum
which has climbed from 95 cents to SI 30
per share. > . . ?
The Bakersfleld Calif ornian makes the
following guarded statement concerning
the Temblor district: B
According to G. ,M. Bobst, a very significant
strike was made a few days ago at the Bishop
camp, on section 13-29-20, in the Temblor dis
trict. " Mr. Bobst, who came to the city yes
terday, states that oil has been struck at 700
feet in large quantities, and that when he left
the field the well was flowing steadily. The
Bishop property Is a short distance from the
Eureka hole, which was abandoned some time
ago at a depth of nearly 1500 feet. Other com
panies in the same neighborhood have failed
to . find favorable formations, and if the re
port is true the news will be received with a
cood deal . of Interest. . . : - .' , <
Oil Producers Hopeful.
. Of the- movement to combine the oil
producers of Los Angeles the Los Ange
les Herald says: , â¢ ; - .
The movement to get the oil producers of
Los Angeles into line for controlling the mar
ket is reported to be making steady headway
by the promoters of the project. Â¦ It was stated
last night that over 600 wells had been prom
ised to the OH Producers' Association, Â¦ of
which more than 400 actually ' signed up. ' In
many cases it is necessary to have meetings
of the stockholders of ' the ; companies before
definite action can be taken in pledging the
control of the â¢ output to Â¦ the | new association,
and many such meetings were held yesterday,
and others are planned for the near future, t
A considerable majority of . the ; wells In the
local field; producing I oil for | the market are
thus pledged, - and it : is believed that it -will
be but. a few days before = a good working
majority will * be tied up... Of. course If there
are a. considerable, number of .:. wells, outside
the : association It will not be I possible to ac
complish bo : much good Â¦ as though they ail
come in, but it Is believed that something can
be done even . though it . should result that a
considerable minority remain â¢ outside. ;' â¢Â¦ Com
mittees of ' the ; association are at : work Â¦ get
ting affairs Â¦ in ; shape for engaging In â¢Â¦ actual
business at an early, date, as soon as the de
tails of the business can: be agreed on.

nethy had thrown away at Hayes and
Polk streets. "When searched a large dirk
knife was found in Abernethy's pockets.
Abernethy first came into notice in June,
1S97, when he was arrested, for stealing
carpenters' tools, and got four months in
the County Jail. February, 1898, he was
sent to Folsom for a year for burglary in
the second degree for entering a house at
11 Geary street, and since then he has
served two terms for petty larceny.
It is supposed that he also broke Into
the butcher shop of G. Pisani, 925 Larkin
Ftreet, about 3 o'clock yesterday morning
by means of a falso key. The cash draw
ers and till had been forced open, but as
the proprietor was careful to take all his
money home on closing up the burglar got

DARING BURGLAR'S NARROW ESCAPE
FROM DEATH WHILE LOOTING A SALOON
Lawrence McDermott, cook in a hotel
at Point Richmond, made a complaint at
police headquarters yesterday afternoon
that he had been drugged by a man in a
saloon on the Barbary Coast and robbed
of $7 50. As he appeared to be suffering
from too much liquor he was taken to the
City Prison and booked on a charge of
being drunk.

Â¦walked along Larkin street. Policeman
Jucl was standing- at the corner of Lar
kin and Grove streets, and seeing Aber
nethy walking hurriedly along accosted
him. Abernethy said that a man had held
him up on Market street, and Juel asked
liim to go wrth him to see if they could
not find the man. Abernethy did not ac
cept the invitation, but bolted. Juel gave
chsse and overtook him on Ash avenue.
About 4 o'clock Abernethy entered the
fsloon of H. Daseking. Polk and Fell
streets, by means of a false key. He
Lioke open the cash register, and the
noise awoke the proprietor, who sleeps in
the rear. He jumped out of bed and ran
into the saloon, confronting Abernethy,
who was so taken by surprise that he
handed over 511 to Daseking which he had
taken from the register. Abernethy ran
out of the saloon and Daseking fired two
6hots at him from a revolver, but neither
took effect.
Albert Abernethy, an ex-coiwict, was
booked at the City Prison early yester
day morning on a charge of burglary, and
it was by the purest accident that he did

CAPTAIN HANSEN SORRY
THAT -HE APPEALED
Severely Censured by Supervising
Inspector Bermingham for Losing
the Steamer Willamette. â¢ "-
Captain" John Hansen "was sorry yester-
day that he had taken an appeal from the
judgment of Captains Bolles and Bulger
suspending his license for one year for
losing the steamer Willamette, for Super
vising Inspector John Bermingham gave
him a more severe scoring, than did the
United States Inspectors of Steam Ves
sels. .:.-Â¦-"
Captain Bermingham rendered ; his de
cision yesterday, sustaining the judgment
of the inspectors. In his written opinion
Captain Bermlngham^ays that the-Wil
lamette -was a â¢ fine' steamer, valued at
$200,000, and that she was lost near Van
couver Island* by being stranded -in foggy
weather "without getting a cast of the
lead.'.' The decision goes on to say that
the excuse Hansen made for not anchor
ing when the- fog set in was that he
wished to-, get through Portiers Pass,
about seventy miles . distant, at a given
time. He should have exercised better
skill In getting through the strait he was
i'aÂ«-n navigj-.ting, , which required, four
. changes of coujso ma distance of about
ten miles. The decision concludes:
, "Had the appellant, who took the re
sponsibility of navigating the ship with
out a pilotâ perhaps- by direction of her
owners â anchored her when the dense fog
set in she would now be in service and he
not here seeking relief from, the penalty
imposed by the lower court' in his "case.
As it was undoubtedly negligence and un
skillfulness on his part which caused the
stranding of the Willamette, which was
a valuable steamer, I cannot give him any
relief. Therefore the findings of the lower
court in his case must stand sustained."
Action by Request of the
.Chinese Minister at
; Washington.
Su Shih Ohin's Mission ,' Is
. One of a Revolution
ary Nature.
The .Collector,' of the Port received an
order yesterday from "Washington to ar
rest and detain for deportation Su Shin
Chin, the reform party leader, against
whose landing Minister Wu and Consul
General Ho Yow had filed a protest on the
ground that Su had obtained by fraud the
passport and other credentials upon which
he was allowed to land, .after having been
vouched for by the Chinese Minister at
..Washington.- Half an hour later Su was
arrested. by -Acting Chief Chinese In
spector j John R." Dunn and , Inspector
Gardiner and placed in the detention shed
at tho Mail dock..
Consul Ho Yow said yesterday that Su
was landed as an accredited official of the
Chinese empire, when in fact he was one
of the leaders of the revolutionary party,
which asserts that its purpose is to re
place the Emperor, Kwang- Hsu, upon
the throne. He obtained his passport by
representing himself to be an official of
the Chinese Government. Su came ' in
company with Loo Chin An and Siep Sung
Yung, graduates of universities and duly
accredited officials of the empire. For
this reason" Su also obtained entrance to
this country as an official. Â¦Â¦Â¦
Su is a 'well educated man of 25 years
and has been . traveling in Kwang Tung
province, Shanghai; Macao, Japan, and
Hongkong, where the - Chinese Govern-,
ment could hot get hold of him. His mis
sion here is said to be the raising of a
fund to assist the revolutionists in their
attempt to seat Kwang Hsu upon the
throne. He must now prove his right. to
be landed as a tourist or a student.
â¢ Siep Sung Yung, one of the traveling
companions of Su Shih Chin, visited the
office of The Call last evening, accompa
nied by Tong K. Chong, editor of the Chi
nese World, and made the following
statement:
Â¦ On the 6th of this month three travelers
from China were landed at this port by Col
lector Strattbn because they had passports and
so forth issued by the Chinese authorities at
Shanghai, which were indorsed by American
Consul Goodnow.
These men were landed immediately, as the
American law designates that a properly is
sued passport 'is the evidence which must be
accepted by this Government. There was no
objection to the landing of. these gentlemen,
except In one instance, namely, that of Su
Shih Chin, for the reason that his political
views are not in accordance with those of
the representatives of the Chinese Government
resident in this country. * .-
The~only crime of which' he Is accused Is
that of. his loyalty to the Emperor of China
and his opposition to the methods of the Dow
ager Empress and her Boxer, supporters. Su
Shih Chin is a deep scholar, and bears wtih
him the degree of Bachelor of Arts.
We are trying- to get him released this even-
Ing, and if, not successful, will get him out
without fail the first thing Monday morning.

la the various forms of general debility and convalescence following certain dis-
eases, such Is the lowered standard of the vital processes that the function of no
organ Is perfectly performed, and with the resulting depression the patient has a
REAL weakness. The physician's first thought, under these conditions, is nerve and
other tonics.
Not Weakness===Symptoms.
By far the greater number of patients, however, seeking relief for so-called "Weak-
ness" Is furnished by healthy and robust men. On examination -we find a Prostate
Gland, -which has been damaged by either a contracted disorder or early dissipation.
These patients have no weakness at all. Prematureness, Loss of Vitality, etc.. are
the symptoms, or disordered function, of the chronically Inflamed prostate gland. We
find by curing this inflammation that full vigor at once returns. It should be under-
stood that tonics, electricity, etc., might cure a real weakness, but would do h?rm
in Inflammation. The main object is to reduce the size of the tender, swollen and
inflamed prostate. This -we accomplish by local treatment, thus avoiding drugs. Hen
â¢who have unsuccessfully treated for a weakness should now understand the cause
of failure. We send free on application a colored chart of the organs, which will

SAN FRANCISCO, May 16. 1901.
Dear Madam: Being prompted through curios-
ity. I called for a reading with you and was,
indeed, very much surprised, as I have always
been somewhat skeptical. You told me my past
life better than I could myself, for I had for-
gotten several things you mentioned; you de-
scribed my family perfectly and told me things
no one knew of besides myself; your diagnosis
of my physical condition is correct, and your
advice on business has been very, valuable to
me.
In view of all this I do not hesitate to say I
have the utmost confidence in your ability to
foretell the future. You are certainly the most
remarkable person I have ever met and cannot
be recommended too highly. I wish you the
success you deserve. Yours very sincerely. '

TANNERS AND BUTCHERS WILL WALK OUT UNLESS
EMPLOYERS COMPLY WITH DEMANDS OF UNIONS
Two more strikes are .impending and
may materialize to-morrow morning.
What are known in trades-union* circles
as the VFrench tanners" are up in arms
against a certain â¢ firm. Slaughter-house
men at Butchertovra also have their griev
ances'and: they propose to insist on the
enforcement of the union rule regarding
the display of union cards.' '. "*
A meeting of the men that make patent
leathers, calfskins, kangaroo, skins, etc.,
was held last night at Maennerbund Hall,
at Twenty-fourth street and Potrero ave
nue. There j were many j speeches made,
proceedings ' being, conducted entirely in
the French language. A "strike against
present conditions was finally ordered.
Secretary Rosenberg and' other members
of i the Labor Council were j present," and
a firm stand will be taken.-
The Iron Trades Council will meet this
morning at 1133 Mission - street. Iron
molders are walking out > dally in many
of the shops that have heretofore not been
affected by the strike, but President Me-
Cabe says the situation is moat hopeful."
i .Some trouble is expected in many butch
er shops where ; union rules have Â¦Â¦, been
agreed to, ; but where the union card is
not displayed. It Is said that the whole
salers have decided not to supply meat
to any one who displays the union card.
Secretary -Rosenberg says the card must
be shown or no union man' will patronize
the place. Â¦ Efforts 'to adjust differences
will be made this afternoon. > ' - -
Two arrests ; of striking waiters were
made yesterday. An' altercation" between
Frank . Brlgham and George Plesslng, in
front 'of the Vienna Cafe, conducted by
Rudeger . & Loesch at 111 Lar,kin street,
resulted in the arrest of both. > Brlgham
was charged with- disturbing : the peace
and Plessing â¢ with 7 disturbing the peace
and carrying concealed^ weapons.
, The trouble ' arose over -y, the .â¢ right of
Loesch, an expert baker and confectioner,
to do his own- work. /Brlgham. : claimed
that Loesch had the . right as one of the

Steamer Movements.
The Fire Commissioners looked over all
these bids carefully but deferred action.
Under the bids Scott &â¢ Magner would
seem to have first place. Before the bids
were opened it was common talk among
the hay men that Scott & Magne*Â»would
be found to be the lowest bidders for hay
and that there is a ring to get a large
price from the city.' The story is also
that a combination was formed some time
ago which was to have included the Pre
sidio, but there was a break and the re
sult was that the Presidio people got their
oat hay at $11 per ton while the city was
to pay $1 50 per ton more. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ Â¦
Offers to Supervisors.
While the "Fire Commissioners were
opening bids the Supervisors' Committee
on Hospitals and Health had also hay
bids to consider. This committee 'has to
provide for supplying the county jails,
police patrol. City Prison, Almshouse,
Emergency Hospital and Insane ward of
the department of health and the Coron
er. The bids to the committee varied from
the figures before the Fire Commission
ers. The best wheat hay bids wM^e as
follows: â¢. .'â¢ - .._'â¢..
D Keefe, $15 88; H. P. Smith & Son. $14 90; J.
L Vermeil. $14 25; Scott & MaRner, ?13 73; Som
ers & Co.. $14; Ryan & Ryan, $14 49.*
Only one bid was. made to supply the
Almshouse with mixed wheat and oat hay
âthat of Scott^A Manner, $12 73. The con
tract for supplying Â¦- the, Emergency Hos
pital Is bid for by only one firm, Peters &
Cowie. which made a price of $13 95. It
will be noticed that these prices are high
er than those made before the Fire Com
missioners. The oat hay required by tho
Fire Commissioners amounts to 1000 tons.
ALL of the sugar fleet listed to ar
rive, save two, have made port.
During the last week they came
in half a dozen at a time, and
should the Rosamond. 15 days
out from Honolulu, and the Colum
bia, 24 days out from Eleele, get in to
day there would be a clean sweep for the
first time in years. Of course there are
plenty of vessels "on the berth" at island
pcrts, and some of them may have sailed
Fince the Gaelic and Zealandia left Hono
lulu, ten days ago, but of all that are '
known to have been on the way only the
Rosamond and the Columbia have still to
be heard from.
The bark Wallace B. Flint was the last
sugar boat to get in. When nine days out
the was within 500 miles of San Francisco.
Strong head winds then came up, and in a
heavy nor'wester on the 1st insL Captain
Johnson had to stand off shore. The
bark's decks were flooded again and
airain, but luckily no damage was done.
For more than a week now the prevail
ing wind has been from the northwest
and blowing strong at that. Yesterday
:t was piping along at the rate of forty
eight miles an hour and the Flint came in
flving before it. Many of the sugar boats
suffered more or less In the heavy
weather, but the captains and owners did
not mind that eo long ' as a week was
clipped off the passage.
PEEHAPS BTHtlTED AT SEA-
The fate of the American four-masted
bij-k BusQueaanna is what the marine un
derwriters Â¦would like to learn. On De
cember 15 last she sailed from Norfolk,
Va.. with a careo of coal for Uncle Sara's
ships at Manila. She -was spoken on Feb
ruary 5 In latitude 27 degrees south, longi
tude 27 degrees west, and since then noth
ing has been heard of her. Several coal
vessels are overdue, and Saturday the un
derwriters must have received Eome news,
for late in the afternoon they offered 55
I>er cent to reinsure the Susquehanna'a
chances.
On the British ship Llnwood, now out
201 days from Manila for New York. 75
per cent Is being paid, but the American
chip is only 174 days out and still 55 per
cent is offered. The Susquehanna Is one
of the finest wooden vessels ever turned
out of the Bewails* shipyards at Bath, Me.
Â£he was built in 1301, and is 2590
tons net burden, 273 feet 6 Inches long, 45
feet 1 inch beam and 19 feet 1 Inch deep.
She was last here about a year ago, and is
in command of Captain M. T. Bailey, who
was formerly mate of the Erskine M.
Phelps.
The oil-laden ship Manchester, long 1
overdue at Yokohama: the sugar-laden
Aladdin, overdue at Sydney, and the coal
laden John McDonald, overdue at this
pert, are still quoted at 90 per cent, but as
far as the Manchester and McDonald are
concerned nobody ever expects them, to
be heard from again.

Sliall the city and county, pay $2 more
per ton for its hay than private individu
als? That is the question confronting
the Supervisors and the Fire Commission
ers. Bids were opened by a committee of
the Supervisors and also by the Fire
Commissioners, in two departments of the
city . government | yesterday, j The figures
showed that an attempt 'is on foot to get
from the city two extia_,dollars per ton
for oat hay, notwithstanding that the
city and county. ' are large purchasers.
This article, guaranteed to ~be prime.V is
freely offered by dealers in the city to
private consumers for $10 50 per ton. Yet
at the City Hall the bids for public sup
piles ranged from $12 43 per ton, which
was the lowest for oat hay, up to $13 90
per ton. Last year the hay men who
were bidders ran the price up so high
tha: all bids were thrown out by the Fire
Commissioners, who readvertised for. pro-:
possls. All the members of the Board of
Fire Commissioners were in their seats
yesterday morning, when- the bids were
piled up on the table. In the- room were
two score merchants, the articles called
for representing' a variety of lines. A
group of hay merchants were in the

YOU CANNOT CURE PILES
By Internal Hemedies.
The only sure way to cure every form
of piles is to use a remedy like thePyra-
mid Pile Cure, which is applied directly
to the; parts affected, and its .wonderful
healing effects are apparent from the
first application, because the medicinal
.properties are rapidly absorbed by tissues
Â¦and- sensitive 'membranes of the rectum,
and the cure is made speedily, and almost
before the patient is aware of, it every
trace of piles 'has- left him. . - .- . "
This is one of the reasons why the Pyra-
mid Pile Cure has been so uniformly buc-
cessful. ; It is applied directly just where
it is needed and where it-will do the most
good. Not by the roundabout way of the
stomach nor the harsh, barbarous meth-
ods of various surgical operations and 6O-
called systems. . â¢ . . .
Direct application to the seat of'diiwaso
is the only rational way, and this is fully
accomplished by the Pyramid Pile Cure.
Â¦ If the voluntary testimony of thousands
who have tried this remedy is worth any-
thing, then no sufferer has any excuse for
longer delaying in giving it a fair trial,
knowing that when you do so the Pyramii
Pile Cure will have made one more friend,
the best possible . advertisement we. can
have. The chiei advantages of the rem-
edy are: It pures â¢-without Â¦Â¦pain,- the' euro
Is lasting. It contains no poison, and last-
ly, Â«it is the cheapest and quickest 'cure
vet found. Your druggist can tell you
what it has done for others. - < . ; '.Â¦ â¢ >
Â¦Testimonials of cures from all parts of
the United States : will .be sent on appli-
cation to the Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall,
'Â¦Mich.; . " . . Â¦-.â¢.-; ..... ; :^'.l:
PUTS THE "GINGER" IN.
The Kind of Food Used by Athletes.
A former college athlete, one of the
long distance runners, began to lose his
power of endurance. His experience with
a change in food Is interesting.
"While I was in training on the track
athletic team, my daily 'jogs' became a
task, until after I was put on Grape-Nuts
Food for two meals a day. After using
the Food for two weeks I felt like a new
than. My digestion was l>erfect. nerves
steady and I was full of energy.
"I trained for the mile and the half mile
runs (those events which require so much
endurance) and then the long daily 'jogrs,'
which before had been such a task, were
- clipped off with ease. I won both events.
"The Grape-Nuts Food put. me in per-
fect condition and gave me my 'ginger.'
Not only was my physical condition
made perfect, rind my weight increased,
but my mind was made clear and vigor-
ous so that I could get out my studies in
about half the time formerly required.
JCow most all of the University men use
Grape-Nuts, for they have learned its
value, but I think my testimony will not
be amiss and may perhaps help some
one to learn how the best results can be
obtained. Please do not publish ray
name."
There -is a reason for the effect of
Grape-Nuts Food on the human body and
brain. The certain elements in wheat
and barley are selected with special ref-
erence to their power for rebuilding the
brain and nerve centers. The product is
then carefully and scientifically prepared
so a* to make it easy of digestion. The
physical and mental results are] so ap-
parent after two or three weeks' use < as
to produce a profound impression. .-The
Food can be secured at any first-class
grocery, Â«tore. ~ -- .. ...
The Prescription Is Sent Free to Any-
-j one Who Writes. ;
A new Bdentlflc means of curing weaknesses
of men and diseases peculiar to the sex' has
at last been discovered, ' and ; the prescription
is being offered free to all who iend name and
address. .
â¢Dr. U. G. Llpes, "1435. Stevenson / building,
Indianapolis, Ind.. is the discoverer . of . this
remarkable new j system of treatment, and he
says there, is now no difficulty in curing:' the
worst cases which may arise from diseases of
this, nature. * '
The Doctor has made a long Btudy of Sexual
Disorders and '" he ' claims â¢ to have found the
exact medicine which removes all traceB 'of
debilitating disease" from the human: system,
restores the fire and buoyancy of youth, and
euppUes the strength of; body and nerves that
all wish for but so few possess.' Impotency, 5
nightly emissions, ? varlcocele, nervousness and
kindred troubles disappear in a j marvelously
short space ' of ' time, "while ; any weakened - or
emaciated organs are restored ;in a ' very few
days to' thslr^ natural elze; and vigor. '. ,-
; When you : Btop to consider the possibilities
of loving and being loved as only strong, well
and happy men can" be it does seem "that any
sexually weak man. should no 'longer ' hesitate,"
but write 'at i once for the receipt which costs
absolutely' nothing. .There -are no restrictions
whatever, as 1 Dr." Llpes | is anxious that ; every
afflicted man-, who, needs ,it should \ have ;,the
benefit of one of; his .free prescriptions with-
out' delay. " The treatment ''. can be used In the
privacy ; of your own , home without the knowl-
edge of even' your moat; intimate friend' or as-
Bociate.;./... '.. 'Â¦.'.':,' . : ' ' f r'^ : * V-'.i^'t^
..-Â¦, Write ; to-day, and ; learn;', that while â¢. the . re^
ceipt costs you nothing - at all, , it '. may. j change
your.-.whole :. existence r from j one X of " misery I to
a continuous life of pleasure and happinew.

"The public schools make â¢ Rood.*pick

n an interview.* He Js a Â¦ native , cf . Bas
ior, was a cliarlaln in the- Union' army
and a rector of St. John the Evangelist's,
one of . the most; important Eplscipil.
churches in New York. , About two years
ago he resigned from the. church and be
came a convert to the Catholic church. , .,
''My conversion vvas not at ail hurried.''
-aid . Dr. de Costa. '.'It was of gradual
growth, and feeling that I was becoming
an old man and having a". firm conviction,
that the Catholic: faith was the only true
' religion I became a convert. Â¦' .
" "The Episcopal church' in this'country
is split up Into' a 'thousand factions.
Bishop Potter is the controller of "the
bread church movement, and Just at pres
ent they 'are on top. He rules the church
of New York and in fact of the tntire
country. â¢ . ,. " Â¦ ' . '; ,
' "'I am a firm supporter of the parochial
school system.- Children : in â¢ these schools
not alone learn .history.? arithmetic and
other, branches, but they are also taught
/a little about the Bible and' Christianity.'
That is the: cry of '.the. Episcopal, church.
It wants to institute 'Church schools, so
that children may be. brought up to know
a lltÂ»e about religion. , .. \ :t :<]
I "It is an error to believeithat the Cath

are outside the faith are lost. ' The church
teaches no such : thing. â¢. It teaches that

believe that if a Methodist believes 5 that

time when Elizabeth of England granted pat
ents to her favorites, will fix at will the price

Let us now 'examine the. trust under another
aspect. Additional reason for the ' condemna
tion of monopolies was given' by the English
judges. as follows: V .- .
, "It tends to the~impovertshment of divers
artificers and others, . who, before, by . the
labor of their hands in their art or trade,
have maintained themselves and their fami
lies,*, who will .of necessity be constrained to

of a comparatively email- number, enjoys the

ple, is! subjected to the unshunnable ; doom of

II chased j'esterday from Mrs. Flor-"
Â£ ence Blythe-Moore and A. A.
JJL - Moore Jr... her husband, by a syn
.. dicate composed of I. W. Hell
man. Ant, Borel & Co! and a number of
associates of Mr. Hellman whose names
are not disclosed. The purchase price has
been kept a carefully guarded secret, but
it is believed to have been in excess of
$2,000,000. â¢ !
No real estate deal of equal magnitude
has ever been made in California. The
one most nearly approaching it was the
6ale of the Baldwin Hotel property to
James L. Flood for $1,000,000. The Blythe
block has been on the market j from a
date since long before the sale of the
Baldwin property, and it has been the
object of negotiations between the owners
and almost every capitalist of large
means in San Francisco. Its sale will fur
nish j the greatest sensation that local
financial circle's have experienced, and its
future disposal will be awaited with
keenest interest. '
The purchasers are not only keeping se-

property may Â¦ be realized when it j Is
known that at present, with the old build-
Ings, it brings in' over $140,000." ,
In answer to a question as to whether
the property would be improved, Mr. Hell
man said: -*: . â¢ Â¦ â¢
"At present â¢improvements have-not
been considered. You can state, however, ._
that in a comparatively short time the '
property, which is in the choicest part of
the city,; will' be suitably improved. Moro
than this I cannot say^ at present."
The sale was.'; consummated
morning, final agreement being reached
in the office of the Union Trust Company
of San Francisco. The actual of
the property will probably not be made
for a month, as the transaction is a colos
sal one and much time will be required
for the examination of titles,' the adjust
ment of leases and contracts with tenants
and other work preliminary to the change;
of ownership.- " \ - â¢ . â¢ (
The sale was * negotiated , by Thomas
Magee & Sons and Walter J. Bartnett of
the law firm of Gunnison, Booth & Bart? ,
rett. Mrs. Florence "Â¦ Blythe. Moore was
represented in the transaction by A. A.
Moore, her father-in-law, andE. S.-Hel
ler'of Heller & Powers represented Mr.
Hellman and his associates. '. ',
The transaction includes, all' the realty '
held by Mrs.- Florence Blythe Moore. Of .
the property bounded . by r Market and
Geary streets and Grant avenue but three
pieces are (held ,by other owners. One is Â¦
the gore lot at Market and Geary streets,
with a! frontage of 37:7; feet 'on Market
street, and 30:6 . feet on 'Geary street,,
owned by . the 'Adams Â¦ and Kibbe â¢ heirs. ;
The adjoining lots, .with a Â¦ frontage of ,
53; feet oh Market -street and ,73 feet 10 ,

. .With the exception of these' three prop
erties all of -the block passes to "the" own
ership-of Mr. Hellman and his associates,
including the lot with a frontage of - 20
feet- 6- inches on Geary street: known'* as'
the Sawyer, lot, which was" recently pur
chased by Mrs. Moore for $50,000.

up "a total which is -doubtless greatly in

Messrs.. HeHman and Borel and the sum
paid for the magnificent piece of realty,
. but they refuse to state what their Inten
tions are concerning it. They say its dis
posal is a matter of the future, to be de
cided in. .view -of the conditions that will
â¢then exist. Apparently it is the intention
of the syndicate of purchasers to sell the
block piecemeal, possibly retaining por
tions "of it upon which to erect buildings
commensurate with the choice location
of the land. . ,
Secrets Carefully Guarded.
I. W. Hellman was asked. last night at
his summer home in San Rafael for a
statement in regard to the mammoth pur
chase. He said: ' ."
.._ "Yes. the property has been purchased.
Borel & Co. are associated with me in the
transaction. There are also others whose
names will not be made public for some
time to come. I decline to state the price
paid for the property. I will- state, how
ever, that this, is the largest real estate
deal that was ever carried through In this
from. all sides of modern and pretentious
buildlng-s, solely because. of the litigation
that tied up the estate of Thomas Blythe.
As Â¦. a further ; illustration . of the increase
in rental- value, the property occupied by

a ten-year lease, signed. a year ago. at an

J>. SI. Delmas Says Monopolies Fix
Prices for Wares and .Services
and Demand Very
Highest.
The lecture-rccm. In the Academy of
Sciences building was crowded to the
doors last night, the cause of the crush
being- the announcement that the gifted
orator, D. M. Delnias, would speak. The
lecture was given under the auspices of
the University Aescc'atlon of Chicago.
Mr. Delmas was In fine 'voice and han
ded his subject with the skill for which
he is noted. He dealt with the Question
fairly, giving- facts and figures to prove
the justness Of* his remarks. He Indulged
in. no oratorical flights, but delivered his
lecture in a straightforward manner that
found favor vrith his appreciative audi
ence.
Mr. Delmas \ps frequently interrupted
by prolonged applause. He made a few
appropriate remarks and then plunged
Into his subject. He said In part:
Trusts th.e Question of the Hour.
' The question of the hour may then be stated
thus. Are trusts good or evil? Are the re
cults of their operations beneficial or injuri
ous to the commonwealth? If Injurious, is
there any remedy, and. If so, what? The an
twer to these questions must be -sought in the
history of the past and the conditions of the
present. â¢ â¢ â¢
To an audience such aÂ« this I need but
briefly recall how. under Pharaoh, Joseph be
came the ruler over Egypt; how, foreseeing
impending dearth. "he garnered up all the
money and the corn that was found in the
land: how. when the famine came, the In
habitants 6ought him begging for bread; how
he replied. "Give your Rattle and I will give
you for your cattle, if money fail": how they
then brought their beasts unto him and re
ceived bread In return ; how, the - following
year, they came once again, and, being al
ready stripped of their herds, "and finding that
they had naught left rave their . bodies, and
their land, they oald: "Buy us and our land for
bread"; bow Joseph, acceding to their re- j
quest, replied. "Behold, I have bought you j
this day and yocr land"; and how they sub- j
mltted. saying 1 . "Thou hast Â¦ saved oÂ«ir Ilvee. i
let uÂ» find grace In the eight of -oÂ«r-LÂ»ord" and
we trill be Pharaoh's servants." And, .thus, i
according to the eIttitj's narrative of the Jewish !
historian, was the first trust operation of the
world consummated.
Let me now come to an epoch more immedi
ate to our own. Monopoly was claimed as one
of the privileges of the crown of England.
This Frivllepe might be exercised directly by
the sovereign, cr It might beâ in practice" It
usually was â exercised ty delegation. The stu
dent cf English history reads with amazement
that, as late as the days of Elizabeth, patents
fer monopolies of objects forming the common
necessities cf life were granted to favorites^
and that the people were turned over to . the
patentees to be taxed and plundered at their
xnercr. â¢>â¢ â¢ â¢_ :
a The matter was at length brought before
*â¬.the courts In 1602, and It was then held that
a grant of monopoly by the crown was against
law and void. This doctrine of the English
Judges has been followed in the tribunals of
every English-speaking country in the world.
It has found a voice in the constitutions of
several of the States, which, like Maryland,
declare Â¦ that "monopolies are contrary to the
spirit of a free people and the principles of a
free government and ought not to be euf-
Wty Are Monopolies Opposed? -
Tl"hy. It may be asked, this settled opposl-
tlon against monopolies? The reason is riven
In the decision of the English Judges to which
I have already referred. Allow me, then,
briefly to examine that decision. The first
rround upon which the Judges placed their con
demnation of monopolies was- that- "the price
of the commodity will be raised, for he who
has the sole selling of any commodity, will
make the price as he pleases." Is not this
ground as tenable to-day* as It was In the
reign of Elizabeth, or at the time when the
Minister of Pharaoh demanded as the "price of
the food which he had monoplllzed. first the
cattle, then the land, then the ! bodies of the
starving Egyptians? â¢ â¢ â¢
The object which Individual^ have In combin
ing under the form, of a corporation, small or
large, is neither charitable nor philanthropic
The incidental result of their operations may be
a benefit to mankind. But this is not the end
which they have in view. Their goal is their
Individual profit. Men form corporations act
uated by the belief that they can make more
money In their aggregated than in their Indi
vidual capacity. Otherwise they would act
elngly. In either case they will make all the
money that the power at their command per
n-its. â¢ . â¢ . â¢

supply is excessive and are subjected to high

It is the avowed object of the trust to nullify
this natural law of economics. Its aim is by

the highest figure which consumption will war
rant. "If the monopolist is left to his .own
devices." says Professor Richard T. Ely, '"we
cannot hope that monopoly prices will be less
Than the highest which yield the largest net
Prices Go Up.
Common experience Is In strict accord with
these a priori deductions. The billion . dollar
eteel trust was 'no sooner started in business
than the price of eteel rails was advanced $2
per tonâ from {26 to t28. The result of the for
mation of the Ice trust In New York was to In
crease the price of Ice one hundred per cent. In
our own midst as eocn as last summer all the
leading wine merchants had united their inter
ests in the California Wine Association, and
the price of wine vu Immediately raised about
SO per cent.
At the Chicaro Trust Conference the follow
ing statement was made by one of the , dele
catf-frâP. E. Doweâ and was passed unchal
lenged:
"I have here a list showing advances In the
prices, due to the direct or Indirect influence
of trusts, of about ISO commodities: the'ad
vances ranging from 5 to 500 per cent. The
list was obtained by representatives of the An
ti-Trust League applying to manufacturers and
dealers f or and making daily re
ports. Neany COO establishments were visited.
The list Is eworn to. â¢ â¢ â¢ Ordinary shovels
doubled in wholesale price and. snow shovels
advanced 145 per cent; iron, SS to 130 per cent;
coal, SO cents a ton wholesale; gasoline, 4 cents
a gallon; -shoes for the worklngmen, 15 to Do
cents oer pair, etc." â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Â¦
It Is safe to conclude, then, that the ; mo
nopolist of the hour, like bis predecessor of
the days when Israel dwelt in Egypt, or of the
Avowed Object of the Corpo
rations Is to Nullify Law
of Economics.

A new departure In politics .Is the Incor

age. The chief purpose of the league Is
to secure good government through the
active agency of representative Republi
can citizens.
As the^new primary election. law gruar
nntees to eyery voter the right to vote
for delegates to nominate candidates for
office and pJso trfves ample assurance
that every vote cast will be counted for
the dplegate voted for.', there 'la an incen
tive for citizens to* register and partici
pate in the pr^marv .movement. To at
tain the common end of displacing bosses
and putting affairs local ln'the hands of
Ht'zens who are roncerned In the wel
ffn-e of thÂ«> city unitv of action is. essen
tial. It H possible that the Republican
Primary League will give all honestÂ«Re
publlrnns a chance to unite their lnflu-'
etioe and *>r>ergy in a campaign for clean
politics and to preserve the advantages
of success nfter the victory for decency
shall have beer, achieved.
A Deliberate Movement.
Before the articles of Incorporation werÂ»
drawn the question as- to the best course
to bo pursued to the end of securing the
nomination of representative men " for
nubUc office was discussed freely by in
fluential and active taxDaying Republi
cans in every district of the city. The
nlari of legal Incorporation did not suring
from | impulse . or caprice. ; Tlie deliberate
Judpment Y of memversed in public affairs
waÂ«* rendered in favor- of the system.
Among the promoters there.is no candi
date for office' and bo- Inclination exists to
favor the cause'of a'riy asolrant for public
strtlon. The maip purnose. It is averred,
is to brine all good citizens of the Repub
lican party together for the purpose of
wresting control of . affairs from the de
graded bosses that have fastened them
selves on the party.
The fact is considered that Republicans
are apathetic and Indifferent because af
fairs of the party,- locally speaking:. werÂ»>
committed to two bodies, each styling It.
self a County /Committee. One of these
lioflies Â¦ Is so hopelessly boss-ridden and;
depraved that no pood can ever come
from It. The other Is under a cloud as to
its legality. There Is .absolute demand'
therefore for an active, vigorous, clean
cut. - anti-boss organization. The pro
moters of the Republican Primary Leapue
maintain that they have opened the way
for Republicans to free themselves from
boss dictation and place In the offices of
city government clean, capable and hon
est men." - I. â¢'.,-'Â¦Â¦Â¦
To Take Assembly Districts.
As prodded in the articles of incorpora
tion, the organization;, through. the agency
of sub-committees, will be extended from
the central league to every Assembly dis
trict of the city. .The , advocates of the
hew departure assert that it. will be read
ily observed that the movement to organ
ize clean elements of the party Is not
in the interest of any class, caste or sect..

All Republicans Welcome. '
The organizers of the league want . ths
fact' to be known that every good Repub
lican is welcome to Join. The Idea 'is to
make - the league powerful | In | every" dis
trict, to Induce citizens who have been In-'
different to the management of public af
fairs to unite in an. effort to oust. the
, bosses and . boss-creatures ; and ' place ..the
reins, of power Into the hands of trusted
men.,' Â¦ V. .' .
! The league will .Immediately establish
central headquarters and proceed to the
establishment of district quarters. The
first and '. most urgent duty ahead Is that
connected with' the registration of voters.'
The next Important .duty will' be the'
nomination of ; representative men to be'
voted for at the primary election August
13, when' delegates , must / be , ] chosen to
comprise - the ; municipal nominating con-'
ventlon of the party. X

tain, he says,- continues 1 to receive more

vested in this class of . manufactures by
the Japanese .last : year -was/ $5,674,546,

7000 'miles of railroad would not suffice for
the needs of the empire." r .â¢ .
, A* Japanese expert, who has. lately

PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO FLY-CASTING CLUB AS THEY APPEARED YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON AT STOW LAKE. GOLDEN GATE PARK, IN PURSUIT OF THE GENTLE PASTIME OF paot
ING A DELICATE FLY. v CAST "
OCEA-C breezes prevented long
casts being: made at the monthly
tournament of the San Francisco
Fly-Casting: Club. The pleasant
weather drew a large number of
devotees of the sport to Stow Lake yes
terday afternoon. The lake was fringed
with spectators, who watcher the fly
casters handle their lines with skill and
delicacy.
. It was a classification re-entry contest,
and many members availed themselves of
the privilege of taking part. Horace
Smith kept tab on the casters. Walter
Mansfield, champion of the world, showed
his fellow members how records are
broken. The tournament will continue
to-day, and it is expected that twice as
many members will be on hand to enjoy
the rare sport. On Tuesday evening the
club will hold its bi-monthly banquet.
Horace Eriggs will read a paper on "Fly

DUTCH VICTORS
BY GOOD LUCK
San Francisco Players
/ Win a Ten-Inning
Game.
The Dudes Make a Brilliant
Effort, but Are Victims
. It was a game full of heart palpitations
and brilliant plays. Ten Innings were
necessary to decide it, and when the
dust ' of the diamond ' had settled, the
Dutch crew was seen going through the
gate with another victory In Its keeping.
Defeat to the Dudes was no disgrace, as
they played as good and even better ball
than the local aggregation. They were
out of luck, and > It now behooves Cal
Ewing to bring a few horseshoes to the
game to-day. â¢
For four innings not an error was re
corded. Heiney Krug gave the scorer a
chance in the last half of the fifth lnninjp
by juggling a swift grounder from the bat
of Dr. Moskiman. Pabst earned the sec
ond one later by trying to play "nigger
baby" with Arrellanes, who waa running
to second. Petey Lohman got a black
mark for throwing wide to second. No
other errors were recorded.
The Dutch did nothing until the fourth,
when Rellly walked, stole second and
came home on a long hit by Evans. It
was the Dudes' turn to go their rivals
one better In the fifth. Two timely bits
scored Arrellanes and Moore. San Fran
cisco evened matters in the seventh. Milt
Clayburgh announced that there would be
a balloon ascension and that Professor
Johnson would be the aeronaut. The pro
fessor gave the signal for letting go the
ropes, and Nordyke responded with a
two-cushion swipe to left field. Croll flew
to center and Josh Rellly dropped a nice
one over Franeks' head and Nordyke
trotted home in record time. There was
nothing more doing in the run-gettln* line
until the tenth. Both teams settled down
to work and put up gilt-edged ball. Oak
land, however, nearly won out to the
ninth, and there la some doubt whether
they were not entitled to a victory.
' Drennan opened with a single to left
and Streib followed with a bit to Rellly.
The latter made a stab at it and Just
touched the bounding sphere. Before no
could recover the ball Drennan was on
third. Streib stole second, and things
looked gloomy for uncle's men. Moski
man flew to Nordyke, and the ball was
thrown home with speed enough to keep
Drennan on the cushion. * Arrellanes hit
to Schwartz, who threw home In time to
nail Drennan at the plate. Francks batted
a slow one to Schwartz, who threw to
Pabst. . The ball reached him a second
ahead of the runner and Umpire Tyler
had the courage to call him out. His de
cision necessitated another inning. The
Germans played in luck. Reilly went out
and Graham was hit by the pitcher. Then
Evans slammed one out for two bases
and Graham came home on wlnga. Hllde
brand scored hl3 third hit and Evans was
caught between bases. Hlldy tried to
make second and both men were put out
by fast work. Oakland could da nothing
and. the agony was over.
Umpire Tyler improved in his work.
But one of his decision* was faulty and
he was hooted. When his nervousness
wears off he probably will do better.
Croll played a star game at center. He>
made five putouts and two assists. Dun
leavy won an ovation by making a dif
ficult catch and later throwing Hllde
brand out at the plate. Following: Is the

Achilles beat St. Helen at 4 to 1.
Â¦ There was no distinction between talent
and piker before the course. For once
they were of the one opinion, for not a
dollar, could be placed against the forty
which awaited takers in the pool box.
Greenhall, on the short end at 10 to 1,
beat Sweet Emma by favor. The dogs
went up the field together and the course
belonged to the one toward which the i
hara would swing. It swung to Greenhall..
Hurricane beat Forget.
Ever Sure, with 6 to 1 against his
chances,' beat Rocker pointless and helped
the pikers who played him to quite an
extent. Down near the bottom of the
card the biggest long shot of the season
had his colors hoisted. Red Agate went
aga!nst his more experienced brother and
won out at odds of 40 to 1. â¢Â¦'Â¦.â¢;
The run - down of the Class Reserve
stake at Union t Coursing Park yesterday
resulted in. a baker's dozen decisions
were' not in accordance with tho
judgment of the wise ones.. Considering
the size of the stake , the day could be
classed as a favorable one 'for the talent
were' it not for the average heavy odds
laid against the victorious short ends. As
it was the big bettors were badly treated:
The first hard rap was lnithe early part
of the stake in the course between San
tonin and McKinley. Santonin has done
considerable work of late \ and close to
finish of -.nearly all his stakes has caused
the best of them to retire. Naturally the
talent, made' him choice over his half
brother, McKinley, though the odds^ of
30 to 1 were out of line. From the slips
Santonin took a slight iead. His ' oppon
ent did the rest, making two turns and
the kill. . Â¦

Bull's injuries were serious, they did
not think they would prove fatal. 5 His
right leg is broken below the knee and

From the clever manner in which the
fellow forces entrances to houses the po
lice are satisfied that "* he is an accom
plished burglar, with perhaps a long crim
inal record. The fact that he touches
nothing but the costliest silverware leads
the detectives to believe that he is an ex

There is a growing suspicion that the
burglar who was discovered in the Woods
residence on Oak street, near Devisadero,
the other night is the same man who has
been operating in the Western Addition.
After being cornered he tried to explain
his presence in the house by saying that
he -had been drinking and thought he was
in his own home.' Woods consented to ac
company him to a street light to allow
him to read a letter which he claimed
â¢would establish his identity, and -while he
was thus engaged the burglar took to his
heels and disappeared in the darkness. ',

INTO DYNAMITE
TO CELEBRATE
SILVER JUBILEE
quarantined institution, by Hoffman, as
sisted by Henry Taber, a deaf fnute.
Hoffman lighted a cigarette and threw
the burning match to the floor, where it
ignited the alcohol that had dripped from
the child's body. The attendant whipped
out a towel saturated with the fluid to
smother the flame. As the cloth struck
the fire there was a sudden flash of blue
flame that swept over the boy's form and
caught Hoffman in its embrace.
Taber rushed with blankets to the as
sistance cf the boy and Hoffman, heed-
Ies3 of his own severe burns, helped to
smother the lire that had completely en
veloped the unforunate boy.
As soon as the blaze had been Quenched,
doctors were summoned. Dr. O. D. Ham
lin. the physician in charge, and Dr. H. N.
Rowell hastened to the patient, and were
reinforced by Dr. J. S. Eastman and Dr.
William S. Porter.
For nearly twenty-four hours every
thing that medical siUl could devise was
resorted to, but the terrible shock was
too severe to overcome. At 1:30 o'clock
this afternoon the child died. The
Coroner was summoned to take charge
and to prepare for the official investiga
tion that shall determine the responsibil
ity for the awful occurrence.
The accident occurred in Bartlett hall,
a dormitory which had been set-aside for
children who had not been stricken with
smallpox, which has been epidemic for
sixty days at the institution.
* The little fellow had been taken to the
dormitory to be prepared for release.
Under the orders from the surgeons all
of his clothing- had been removed, his
hair cut and he was given the alcohol
bath which proved so fatal. This pro
cedure had- been followed in fifty other
cases as a precaution against possible
contagion.
Hoffman had been sent out from Oak
land at the outbreak of the smallpox
epidemic as an assistant in the care of
the patients. He had been employed at
such work by the Oakland Health Depart
ment. ' Although not an expert nurse he
was considered competent for the duties
prescribed.
Superintendent Waring Wilkinson, in
charge of the institute, declares that the
accident was inexcusable. He said:
"We have had two men,- Hoffman and
Berry, extra assistants, sent out from
Oakland to attend to the bathing and
fumigating of the children whom we felt
safe in sending home. These men have
been giving each child two baths, the sec
ond one being in the nature of an alcohol
1Kb. Hoffman was applying the alcohol
to little Wirt Allen when he stopped to
light a cigarette. He threw the match,
still blazing, on the floor. He probably
realized the danger of the saturated room,
for he whipped at the match with a towel.
But this towel Â¦was full of alcohol. In an
instant the stuff ignited and the poor child
was all ablaze.
Â¦'Henry Taber. one of our deaf mute su
pervisors, was assisting at the time. He
had the presence of mind to jump quickly
and place his hand over the boy's mouth
in order to prevent his inhaling the
flames. Hoffman threw a rug around the
child and managed to put out -the blaze,
but not until the unfortunate lad was
burned and roasted In a horrible manner.
"This is an. awful ending to the small
pox epidemic. The child was perfectly
well. The precautions we were taking
with him were only those that we have
used in the case of the other 125 who
have been sent home already. Wirt Al
len has been with us three years. <
"We shall have to take- steps against
Hoffman. The directors have been noti
fied, but we shall probably awair the re
sults of the Coroner's inquest."
-Superintendent Wilkinson's statement Is
based upon a report made to him by Tab
er. When the superintendent questioned
Hoffman the attendant declared he did
not know how the accident occurred.
Hoffman is a middle-aged man. He
shows marks of the accident on his per
son. His right hand is badly burned and
his hair, eyebrows, eyelashes and face
are singed.- He is uncommunicative and
t$kes the accident very much to heart.
The child was the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Allen of Winters. The mother was
at the child's bedside when he passed
away. He was conscious and kissed her
a short time before the end came.
BERKELEY, June 8.â After lingering
for twenty-four hours in agony. Wirt Al
len. 9 years old, a deaf mute, pupil at the
State Institute for the Deaf. Dumb and
Blind, died this afternoon from burns sus

WANT SURRENDER
OF CONCESSIONS
VANCOUVER. B. C. 'June 8.â Three
thousand Indians ; to-day presented the
Passion Play at Chilliwack.^The tabjeaux
and all the ceremonies'in connection were
the most unique and elaborate of the kind
ever produced on . this continent. Â¦ Every
detail of the Passion was presented by the
Indians, who, have been" training for the
event for months. American visitors
formed a large part" of the number who
witnessed the impressive, scenes- this .af
ternoon. There we're several hundred vis
itors from Seattle and Tacoma, and, with
the great gathering of brightly dressed
natives, more than 4000 persons thronged
the big field In which the play was held.
Early, this morning the introductory cer r
emonies took place. Blessings were pro
nounced by Bishop Dontenwill, Fathers
Chirouse and Lejeuneand others of the
attendant clergy. Just after noon the pro
cession was formed and first marched
through the town" of: Chilliwack. The
clergy walked with eight of the older
chiefs at the head of the long line of In
dians. Many families rode in carts and in
many of the wagons there were frequently
three generations of native braves.
The -site of the crucifixion was similar
to the real Golgotha of the Scriptures.
Fiom the small hill on which a stand had
been arranged for the performers the
ground sloped away into the galley and
down toward Mount Baker, which is oniy
a mile or two away. Here had gathered
the larger number of the spectators. The
regiment of red men came down from. the
village and after a short pause com
menced-marching around the platform.
The little hill was encircled three times,
the. Indians chanting the while hymns
they had learned from the pioneer priests.
Tho various evolutions necessary for car
rying this out with such a large body of
men and women of all ages were enacted
to a nicety.
Then .for the greater part of the after
noon the scenes of the passion were en
acted in detail. Each was explained spe
cifically by Bishop Dontenwill. or by one
of the assisting priests, for it was the
object to impress the native mind with
the solemnity- of the occasion. -
Â¦ Tho first was that of Christ's visit to
Getn.semane, which was carried out in
every realistic detail, â¢ from the tableaux
of the sleeping disciples to the grove of
trees through which the Savior passed in
his walk. With no delay, the betrayal by
Judas was shown and then attention cent
ered on the third scene, that of the trial
by Pontius Pilate. The Roman Governor
was shown amid all his wealth, and alto
gether the scene was depicted with rare
magnificence. !
The meeting between Jesus and' his
mother created a marked" impression upon
the throng.
Then came a marvelous reproduction of
the scene in which was Christ bearing the
cross, coming along the edge of the hill.
The young chief . who enacted this part
bent down and finally collapsed under the
burden of the cross, and was relieved by
the disciple who stood i next him. This
piece of work was carried out' very pret
tily.
Following came the exhortation by
Jesus to the two prisoners who were to
be executed with him. The cross was ar
ranged with a mechanical contrivance so
that blood would pour out of the .various
wounds from which the Master was
shown to have suffered. , â¢ ,'~ - . .
â¢ Finally, there was .the death scene and
that of the removal from the cross. The
Roman soldiers stood around in all the
glory of ancient magnificence, vhile
Mary, the mother, of Jesus, and Mary
Magdalene and other women were suita
bly portrayed. â¢ â¢ ' â¢ '
At the close 'ot the scenes, which num
bered sixteen In all, the priests gave the
Indians lessons from the passion and ad
dressed them in small groups until the
gathering broke up at dusk.

tary of the Navy, was examined by" Jacob
F.' Shipherd, the promoter of the original
Honduras Company. .It is - claimed that
General Tracey and others, after learning
the projects and plans of the Honduras
Company, formed the Honduras Syndicate
and obtained for the Honduras Syndicate
valuable concessions, .which should have
gone to the Honduras Company.
General Tracey said he had been In
formed that Shipherd had dropped out of'
the enterprise, but that there was no rea
son why he or others should drop out.
Shipherd had Â¦ promised to see him, but
failed to do so. Suddenly he was con
fronted with the signing of the papers. He
thought that Shipherd would prefer to
have him on the inside. He told his as
sociates in the enterprise that Shipherd
must be well treated, but he thought the
compensation of $50,000 given to Shipherd
was extravagant. -.' ,:
General ; Tracey said the relation of
counsel never existed between himself and
anybody In connection with the projected
Honduras enterprise.' Shipherd read a
letter written by Frank Loomis, referring
to General Tracey and himself as counsel
for the y Honduras Company. - General
Tracey said >* that . Loomis + "may, have
thought that I was counsel, but I never
intended to creato j in Â¦ Mr. Loomis* mind
the Jdea that my relation was that of
counsel." , , * - j

that San Francisco and its commercial

Â¦with them. He dwelt on the importance
of the work of the Commissioners, and
read a humorous composition entitled the
"Ten Commandments for Railroad Com
missioners" that caused nearly laugtiter.
Judge Prouty of the Interstate Commerce

Â¦that he was doubtful if it would prove
as beneficial to this coast as was sup
j.osed.
Mayor Phelan responded for the "City
of San Francisco," and paid a tribute to
â¢.ho iron horse and the men who had
driven it across the continent, buildin? up
p great empire. The Mayor argued that
ihe proposed isthmian canal would be of
material benefit to the Pacific Coast and
that it would provide a quick route to the
markets of the East and Europe for the
products of this State.
General Gobel of Pennsylvania was
called upon to speak of the resources of
'ha* State, and said that he had attend
ed ihe banquet to listen and not to speak,
but that he would do his best. General
'iobel is an after-dinner orator and his
speech v.-as the caus=e of hearty applause.

It is a clean, clear liquid that enters

without which there Is no real femi-

Central Pacific as sufficient to complete Its
line to the Pacific Coast. Authorized disclaim
ers met many of these rumors. Of general con
ditions which have played a part in the week's
speculation most important was the. undis
turbed course of business. The firmness of
prices and the continued high level of rail
road earnings have shown nn effect from that
<?tock market panic, although time baa been
given for Fiich effect to bseome evident. This
is accepted as reassuring as to the soundness
of general conditions and as demonstrating that
the speculative furor had not resulted in in
flation outside of the stock market.
Business in railroad bonds has been small

CLOSING,
NEW TORK. June 8.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market to-day was extremely idle
and the tone was consequently dull, in the
general inactivity American shares were
neglected with the rest and were practically
featureless. There were, however.- a few pales
in anticipation of the coming settlement This
selling put American shares under, parity
London Market.
"WASHINGTON. June 8.â To-day's statement
of the Treasury balances in the general fund,
exclusive of the $150,000,000 gold reserve in the
division of redemption, shows: Available edsh
balance, $167,734,053; gold, $96,392,194.
Condition of the Treasury.
The Financier, says: One of the surprising
features of the New \ York bank statement of
June- 8 is the extension of $21,284,400 in the
loan item. The effect of this increase was
shown in a corresponding rise in deposits and
as thisjin turn necessitated a very much
larger reserve the excess surplus suffered a
decline of about $S,CC0,O0O, the loss of nearly
$3,000,000 in cash holdings having been an ap
preciable factor in this respect. The present
e-icess stands at $13.341, SCO, as against $21,253.-
CO for the preceding ,week. The decline is
equivalent, therefore, to 37 . per cent, which,
for one week's operation is unusually large.
The increase in the 'loan item can be attrib
uted Jn part to Union Pacific convertible bond
operations which called for heavy accommoda
tions during the week and the fact that one
bank which had a great deal to do with the
transaction reported an increase in loans of
about $S,CÂ«0,000 strengthens this theory. â¢ In
addition, however, it is known that commission
houses have been borrowing heavily, especially
on long time and this also assiste'd in swelling
the volume of outstanding loans. "With refer
ence, to loss in cash of $2,981,400, it is to be
remembered that the statement of the banks
for the previous week accounted for nfcout
half the gold taken for export, and the re
mainder probably shows In the present exhibit.
The cash totals are" still nearly a million dol
lars at variance with known operations for
the week, but this is attributed to the mislead
ing system of averages on which the state
ment is compiled. It is worthy of note that a
discrepancy of about ten millions now exists,
as between the clearing house statements and
the meat active preliminary statistics based
upon known operations extending over a
period of three or four weeks and the assump
tion that the condition of the banks, from a
cash .standpoint. Is better' than shown in the
present statement is not unwarranted. The
excess surplus, hov.ever. is large enough at
this time to minimize the effect ot.the heavy
changes noted, and it is not regarded as likely
that money quotations will show material fluc
tuations. Advices from important centers are
to the effect that difficulty -is experienced in
holding rates at their present level..

CHICAGO. June 8.â Bears In the wheat pit
had the better. of the news on, hand before"
the beginning of the â¢ session, and July wheat
opened H^Mc, lower, at: 73c " on heavy rains
throughout Kansas and" Oklahoma, where mois
ture was badly needed. The Impression created
was that the' Kansas .crop would be about
equal to last year's. The rains, with some
what lower cables, caused an early decline of.
%<;, but the .pressure to sell was not general,
as the better crop prospects appeared ! to war
rant, and this feeling of > reluctance was sup
ported by later reports that possibly the Kan
sas rains' would interfere with -harvesting.
This bit of news caused a reaction in .the
price to 73%c. The market fluctuated narrow
ly and gave evidence of considerable bull sup
port, and there was also a fair campaign of
profit-taking. . July wheat closed' firm ami U
@%c to %<&'/Â£c higher'at 73Ji@73%c. â¢ - ,"
Corn was steady over a narrow range . of
prices with business, chiefly of a local specula
tive character. July closed J ,s@'ic lower.-: at

Oats were fairly active and steady. July
closed unchanged at 28%c. Â¦ â¢ ' â¢ â¢ Â¦ -
A good demand for lard was the mainstay
of the provision market. July pork, -lard and

NEW TORE. June S.â There -was nothing to
indicate any change in the professional char
acter of the stock market to-day and its de
pendence upon manipulation for any important
variation In prices until the appearance of
the bank statement on the tape. There was a
lively spilling- out of stock after that and sharp
breaks in prices, which wiped out the greater
part of the gains In the strong stocks and
carried the general level of prices substan
tially below last night's closing level. The
heavy inroads upon reserves revealed by the
statement was a surprise, although adequate
explanation may be found for it. It will be
remembered that last -week's statement showed
an unexpected increase In cash, and it now
appears that a part of last week's gold ship
ments did not figure in last week's statement,
but was carried over into this week. The early
strength of the Gould Southwesterns. led by
Missouri Pacific, of the Tobacco stocks. Amal
gamated Copper and a number of minor rail
road 6tocks had served to lift the market from
its early depression, but the selling brought
out by the bank statement sent prices lower
than before. There was early heaviness in the
United States Steel stocks before the general
market turned downward. St. Paul's decline
from the best was S*i. Rock Island 3, Missouri
Pacific and Union Pacific 2'i each and Amal
gamated Copper 3*4- The closing was unset
tled and irregular after some fitful rallies and
renewed declines. ,
Speculation in stocks was more active this
week, and the average of dally transactions
was well over a million shares. The business
done by commission houses afforded somÂ» in
dication of renewed interest In stocks on the
part of the outside public for the first time
since the overturn on May 9. but the principal
force in the buying was, as heretofore, pro
fessional operators and the larger financial in
terests. It has been current belief that some
of the large operations have been connected
with the progress of establishing further com
munity of interests among railroad powers of
the country. The professional operators in
stocks have used every effort to foster this
belief to help the advance in prices. The heavy
realizing at the higher level of prices disclosed
the fact that some of the previous large buy
ing wtÂ« purely ppeculatU'e, and this threw
doubt on some of the reports circulated of
plans for further railroad combinations. Em
phatic official denials of any of these reports
added to the doubts regarding them. It is
also known that short lines were driven to
rover by the advance and the manipulation for
the advance was in part directed toward forcing
this covering. fhort selling was done last
week in the incipiency of the advance and
'was based on the assumption that in the pro
fessional state of the market reaction was
normally due. Part of it was also an Inci
dent of the bull movement in wheat, based
on the reports of drouth in the West. It was
clear that holders of ,Iong stocks were taking
advantage of the necessities of the shorts to
market their holdings at a profit. The reports
of rain In the West later facilitated this profit
taking in stocks and Induced liquidation in
wheat. Wall-street gossip had it that some
large speculative lines of stock that had been
carried through the panic both here and abroad
had been marketed at a profit, after having
ehown large losses at one time. A continuing
Influence early in the week was the official an
nouncement made Ia6t week that the Northern
Pacific quarrel had been settled. Nothing was
given to the public regarding the terms of set
tlement and rumor had a wide scope in con-
Fpquenc* 1 . In Us various phases this had it
that bonds to be exchanged for Northern Pa
cific Ftock would be Jointly guaranteed by
Oreat Northern, Union Pacific. St. Paul and
Northwestern. The strength of Hock Island
was supposed to be due to Its inclusion in
the benefit of the project, but was later ex
plained by the Issue- of extra stock at par to
stockholders and the Bdmlssion to the direc
torate of steel men who had thus reinvested
their profits from the steel merger. Union Pa
cific, it was said, would lease the Atchlson
and guarantee dividends. Later the election
as a director of Atohlson of a member of the
firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. was taken as fore
shadowing a policy of exchange of representa
tion In the companies oontroll"d bv the groups
of capitalist* brought Into conflict In the North
ern Pacific contest. It was said that Southern
Pxdflc would be relinoulshed to Missouri Pa
cific at compensation. Union Pacific retaining

. Liquid Air has evolved from the experimental stage Into a substantial reality, what
It, may do la no longer a speculative, unsolved problem. What it HAS done and what It
; is doing are the criterions of Us future. -
During the past six months the development of liquid air has
equaled the progress; made in the early- history of electricity in the
first six years, as is proven by the successful operation by this
company of liquid air refrigerator cars on the Vanderbilt system,
and the erecting of a large refrigerating plant for the Ballentine
Brewery of Newark, N.J., which includes the supplying of their re-
frigerator cars and the operating of 80 delivery wagons' as auto-
trucks, utilizing liquid air as the motive power.
This company is operating daily on the streets of New York,
Washington and Paris its automobiles propelled by liquid air at a
cost of two-thirds of a cent per mile, capable of making a mile a
minute, and with a total weight of vehicle, motor and liquid air of
only 600 pounds, charged to go 100 miles.
It is producing a light so brilliant that it is impracticable to
look at it with the naked eye,and 1000-candIe power is being
produced at the present cost of 16 C^_P. electricity and 20 C. P.
gas. It is -installing a 40,000 C. P. light in the heart of New York
City at the Central Park Circle.
9$ Practical tests have proven that It will effect great economy In the metallurgical In-
dustrie?. 'saving a large percentage of the coke consumed in MiÂ» smelting Industry, which,
when it "becomes in general usage, will amount to several hundred thousand dollars a day.,
to redound to the profit of this company. - ' . .
Â¦ When combined with â¢ hydrocarbon it produces an exoloslve equivalent to dynamite
at a small fraction Â¦ of the cost.. In the commercial production of gases, such as oxygen.
â¢ hydrogen, nitrogen and carbonic gases, Â¦ It is capable of production at 25 per cent of thÂ»
present cost. . â¢ Â¦ '/) ' -
Liquid air is the most natural refrigerant in the world, being.
312 deg. below zero. What electricity has accomplished as a mo-
tor power in- metropolitan traction vs. steam applied through ca-
ble, supplying a more satisfactory power at 40 percent of the
cost,, is now being duplicated by liquid air to. replace the present
ammonia, brine, sulphuric acid and ice systems. This means in
the course of time the saving of 60 per cent of the cost under the
present'systems, for which there was- expended last year in the
United States $170,000,000. thus, effecting a gross earning of
$100,000,000, which, if this company should receive but 15 per-
cent of the same, would amount to $15,000,000 per annum, or
the equivalent of 150 per cent interest on its entire capital stock
from the refrigerating industry alone, not to mention its applica-
tion to the balance of the world's industries.
