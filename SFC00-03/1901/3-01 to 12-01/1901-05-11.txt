things in the President's
Journey to-day. He saw
6cme of the old missions and was wel

ancient halls and ealleries. He saw the

trip he saw the broad Pacific," blue and

One of the most satisfactory portions
of the programme was the public recep

in the middle of the spacious room, the
riage, it was remarked by those who had
seen the efforts of other cities, was by
far the most striking and beautiful tne
President had yet occupied. Drawn cy
four white: horses, the footman In pinK

with duchess roses against a backgrouna
of gray moss, it was a pleasant reminder
of flower festival days. Messrs. E. ti.
Thompson, George McComber, Sprouie
and Orella were the outriders.

Visit to the Old Mission.
The party was then driven to the old
mission, where the Native Daughters
were waiting. The President was met by
Mrs. J. J. MacGregor, president of the
parlor, who presented McKinley, for Mrs.
.McKinley, a silver plate engraved with
a picture of the old mission. From - the
mission the President was driven through
the town and to the plaza school, where
the crowd was waiting for him and where
he made a speech. He said:
passed before them they greeted him with
cheers, at the same time strewing his
path with flowers. Every child had a bas
ket piled high with flowers, and before a
minute had pased every basket was empty
and the roadway was like a soft carpet
woven in brilliant colors. Beyond the chil
dren the members of the various fraternal
orders of Ventura were ranked along the
driveway and they each in turn saluted
the President as he passed along.
-Among the orders was that of the Re
bckahs, the members of which were all
dressed in white. They carried long white
staffs, and at each right shoulder was a
large bow of pink or olive-green ribbon.
Several hundred, pioneers of Ventura
County were also in line, and the oldest
of these, L. F. Eastin, who has seen fifty
years pass over California, presented Mc-
Kinley with the badge of the society and
declared the President an honorary mem
ber of the organization. They shook
hands and the President thanked him in
a few kind words.

During the time the President was here
an incident occurred which demonstrated
his great popularity. The residence of the

who alluded to Santa Barbara as the

took the cue and brought it to. a finish.

Â¦ Standing here to-day, I am reminded that
the ark of liberty has moved out into the
distant ocean. Your citizens were quick
to enlist for the Spanish war?. California,
has never failed to make a ready response
to the call of the executive. There were
many thousands who wanted to go, and we
could not take them, and the reason why
they wanted to go was to relieve a people
who had lived in oppression for centuries
and to sustain the glory and honor of the
republic
As a result of that war we are In tba
Philippines, and we do not mean to come
away. We will give these people what we
gave you forty years ago, the blessings of
American liberty.
What a splendid civilization has come out
of the old States and old nationalitiesâ the
best in the world. It leads wherever it en
ters on distant seas or distant lands and
carries with it the ark of freedom.
I suppose I might call the roll of the
States of the Union, commencing with the
original thirteen, and then naming the
thirty-two which have been added, and I
would find men who had been born In
each of those States here in the city of
Santa Barbara. And if I called the roll
of the wars of the country, beginning with
the Mexican war, there would be ready
answers from this great audience, and I
would find veterans from each of those wars

was deiayed. as the railroad officials
would not permit any special train to

At a meeting of the Ariel Rowing Club
held on Monday night it was decided to
begin work on the new boathouse- as soon
' as possible and a committee was appolnt
efl by President E. J. Lynch, with full
.Ijower to draw on the club funds, for the
purpose of having the necessary surveys
â¢ and plans made. The committee consists
of W. T.,Howe, L. Franks, F. W. Col
lins. W. McKee and Charles Wilson. Tbe
. house will be built on a rock distant about
a hundred yards from the shore and af
- f oroing an excellent location for the pur
poses of a boat club. Concrete piers and
walls in addition to the rock' will make
a. fine foundation arid there will always
be deep water fpr swimming and launch
ing boats at any state of the tide. Though
the Ariel Club has not yet been served
with notice to quit the present quarters
oh Long Wharf it is expected. that service
- of the notice will not be delayed long and
It !e hoped to have the lower story of the
new house ready for use when the old
quarters have to be given up. The second
can be added later as funds permit. Plans
for a boathouse forty feet by seventy feet
have been already drawn up, but the com
mittee will visit the- other "houses round
the bay before finally adopting them. In
consequence of the removal from Long
Wharf to the new site the proposed club
regatta may be given up. x>r it may be held
as a farewell ; ceremony. The new site
was granted by the Harbor Commission
ers, who promised that the oarsmen will
not be disturbed in its enjoyment.
The Pioneer Rowing Club held .t meet
ing at its boathouse on Long Wharf on
Sunday -and appointed a committee of
which T. Sands Is chairman, -to wait on
the Harbor Commissioners and ask them
to allot a site for* a boathouse to the
club.
At the club regatta of the South -End
oarsmen last Sunday George McGrill In
a shell beat James P. Foley in !a wherry
by one length over the Long Bridge
course. In a four-oared barge race Frank
Dupllssea'* crew -beat E. Scull v's crew.
The winning crew was made up of C C.

Interest, not only to the nominators, .but

will be held on Thursday next, and al
ready the boys are looking for 'the best
material in the midweek class of coursers.
The loser of a, first course will be fined,
and no guarding will be permitted. That
the event is to be exclusive is shown by
the fact that nominators- must take their
hounds to the KJips, catch them after the
trial and return them to the kennel.- Dea

some close contests' in the men's event,
B. b. Adamson and Warren Gregory ty
ing /or first place with a score of. 103 for
the' eighteen holes, S. L. Abbot "Jr. 'and
H. Â¦ C. Golcher tying for third . olace with
10S, J. W. Byrne handing in 109, and R.
Gilman Brown 110. P. E.' Bowles Sr.;and
P. E. Bowles Jr. were the 'only members
of "the Oakland- Golf Club who olayed,
though Ernest R.'Folger, J. A. Folger and
others had entered. When the tie between
B.'D. Adamson and Warren Gregory was
played off over eighteen, holes last: Sun-,
day imornlng B. D. Â¦ Adamson ; proved an
easy winner wlth'a . score of 104 to \V.
Gregory's 114, and captured the handsome
three-handled silver cup. Some surprise
was expressed that the-* winner* did not
hand in a score below 100 for the two
rounds, but It may be said that the
course Is narrow . and that a mistaka is
heavily penalized. It is,' however." very
sporty and offers plenty of -opportunities
for good golf. Y' '
To-day was se,t for the return match
between 'teams of the San Rafael and
Sausalito^ Golf 'clubs, but the game has
been postponed for two weeks, as R. G,H
man Brown and Dr. H. O. Howitt of the

departure of the Albatross, the officers of
which . are -' enthusiastic- golfers.. ; F. B.

players, is also out of practice, vlt Is expect
ed that both clubs will- be able to get to
gether . teams more fairly I representative
of their strength on the 25th. The recent
rain has brought up the thistles and the
thick grass on the Sausalito course . and
made play difficult. The; clubhouse Is

CJub proves her to be a fast boat. The
*=v.or. Edna, the present holder of the
Wallace cup, will have no walkover In the
annual race for that trophy on Decora
tion day. The victory of the Jessie E re
flects crreat credit on her owner, who de
pipned and built her entirely himself. She
is a keel boat, and is constructed of un-
UFiAJly strong and grood material.
Measurer Thomas Jenning-s of the Cor
irthian Yacht Club is compiling a record
of V.ie measurement of all the boats In
Ijm fleet, to be used as the basis for cal
**"'aticn of time allowance in all races,
when any changes affecting a yacht's
measurement are made the secretary or
reeas-nrer must be notlSed. - - - Â¦
The whole fleet, with one or two excep
tions, of the San Francisco Yacht Club
lias been remeasured according to' the
Seawanhaka-Corlnthian plan, and as a
result the racing length of the boats has
b*en considerably reduced.' According to
tbe old system in vogue in the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club of adding the over all and
water line measuremnts and dividing the
sum by two. the schooner Lurline had a
tailing length of 76.S5 feet. Under the sys
tem "now used her racing length, while
still the highest, is 62.50 feet. H. R.
Simpkins' yawl Tramontana will not take
psxt !n the race, as she Is not yet In com

The California Yacht Club will follow
its schedule and will cruise to-night to
Ixine Tree Cove, Angel Island, returning
to-morrow. Most of the boats will have
ladies on this cruise. Next Saturday the

collie ion with the freight steamer Transit
last Saturday evening. She was prepar
.irp to sail down the creek, with the view
of anchoring for the night off the narrow
jrtug-e mole, -when the accident occurred,
tha wind being so light that she had no
steerage way. The steamer, on the way
to her slip, struck the yacht full amid
ships on the port side, carrying away her
rigglup and crushing the side of the deck
house in two places.
All the streams are reported to be run
ning , clear. In the larger streams there
ia a great deal of snow water, making bait
f.rhlng better than fly.
J. A. Pariser fished in the estuary on

ANGLERS WHO
HAVE SUCCFSS
tember, If at all. Jeffries, as- soon. as his
contract -expires with Brady, will come
West and then there will be a fight in
which the local managers will be involved.
The San Francisco Club, claims this big
plum undeniably. So does the "Twentieth
Century, for that matter. The chances of
lively bidding seem ripe.
For its July date the San Francisco
Club negotiated with Jack Moffatt and
Jack Root. Pooler, who manages Mof
fatt. wants none of Root, who, he says, m
too heavy for his man. So this fight Is
off. but there are others that are in the
mind's eye. 4 v
The San'Franci3co Athletic Club has thÂ»
July date. At. first that organization
promised something novel In fisticuffs for
the Fourth of Julyâ an opÂ«n air perform
ance in which the heavyweights would do
a brief . turn or two and then pass out.
But this has been knocked in the head by
the Indisposition of the heavyweights who
will not be aeen here until August or Sep-
seen a.id the edge of curiosity ha3 been
worn away with the outpouring of eleven
odd thousand dollars, the size of the
house when he fought Gardner. Terry
has made a good impression, but the pub
lic calls upon him to sustain it in a fight
with a man who is his match.
Hererra is not taken very seriously by
the sporting public, yet he has done soma
excellent- work, is strong and talks brave
ly The people from Bakersfleld are anx
ious to back him. but they have never seen
McGovern fight when he had to fight, so
their opinions and reckless offers do not
count for much. It 13 true that Hererra
is young. Gardner Is old. Hererra has
confidence and Gardner had none. The
fight after all might amount to something.
It certainly ought to be more of a contest
than the McGovern-Gardner affair while
â¢ It is strange but nevertheless true that
this match will be regarded by the public
In the same light aa a preliminary and
the preliminary as the principal event.
The Impression made by Dougherty and
McFadden in their ten-round mlxup Is
held in memory by th9 patrons of the
game and many will flock to the National
Club's next offering for no better reason,
than to see these bantams at it again.
Dougherty has gained weight as
well as friends since his arrival here and
many look for a wiping out of the . ref
eree's bad decision when the Philadelphi
an crosses with the Frisco "kid."
â¢ â¢ *
McGovern on the Calendar for
the. Month â Heavy Weigh's
Will Not Show for a Time
The fight this month will be between
Hererra and McGovern before the Nation
al Sporting Club at popular prices. As
a preliminary Danny Dougherty and Kid
McFadden will try fistic conclusions.
The wise men from the Cast who cams
out to San Francisco do not like the at
titude of the local ring goers. They say
that too much is wanted for the money in
this Western town and that just to see
Terry McGovern fight is show enough for
a shining gold piece. Thi3 of course is a
fallacy. Ring goers in this city expect
more than a show for their money. What
they want at all time3 is a fight and
the closer the contest the better satis
fied Is the public. McGovern has been
PLANS OF THE
PROMOTERS OF
PRIZEFIGHTS
YACHT RACE
FROM VALLEJO
TO SAUSALITO
San Francisco Fleet Accompa
nied by Corinthians Wi' I Sail
Up the Bay This Afternoon
At 3 o'clock this afternoon, on signal
from the flagship Ramona, the fleet of the
Sar Francisco Yacht Club will set sail
from Sausalito for Vallejo. The/ Cor
inthian fleet will also cruise up to Vallejo
to-day and will anchor off Mare Island.
To-morrow the first race of the season
from Vallejo to Sausalito will take place
among the yachts of the San Francisco
fleet. There was to have-been a reception
and jinks at Vallejo to-night, at which
the commodore and members of the Val
lejo Yachting and Boating Club were to
have been hosts of the city yachtsmen,
but the clubhouse at Vallejo is not yet far
enough advanced to receive visitors, and
eo, for the present at least, the entertain
ment has been called off.
On the occasion of the San Francisco
Yccht Club's first trial of speed from Val
lejo to Sausalito on May 21, 1899,. J. D.
Spreckels* schooner Lurline was the
siar-c'ard boat, all the other craft receiv
ing a time allowance from her. After a
very interesting and close finish the
â¢schooner Aggie, then owned by E. A.
Wilu-ee.' won the prize flag for. best cor
rected time by a margin of less than'four
minutes, inclusive of 2 minutes 39 sec
onds time allowance. G. E. Billings'
sloop Nixie took the prize flag offered to
the- yacht finishing first. In that race the
time allowances were allotted at the be
ginning, the yachts crossing the starting
line in order, the smallest first and the
largest last. All the yachts, too, were in
cluaed in one class. On this occasion
sloops and yawls under 35 feet fn racing
length will be in class I, and schooners.
sloops and yawls over 35 feet in racing
kngth will form class II. The signal for
the small boats in class I to start will be
a blast from the whistle of Port Captain
James Kittui man's launch America at 9
a. m., ten minutes being allowed within
which to cross the line. At 9:59 a. m. a
blrst from the whistle of the launch
America will give the signal for the start
of class II, cen minutes being allowed.
The starting line will be an imaginary one
dr^wn from the launch America across
the Carquinez Straits to the gangway of
the T.'nited States reeelvins ship Inde
pendence. The finishing line will Â¦ be
dra^in from the San Francisco Yacht
CJub house at Sausallto to a stakeboat
anchored about four hundred yards di- :
rectly off the club wharf. The stakeboat
must be left on the starboard hand, and :
time will be taken by officials on the
IKjrch of the clubhouse. The yacht in each
etesp making the fastest corrected time
will receive a prize flag. The following
are the yachts of the club, with the time
allowances based on their racing length;
THE annual tennis tournament for
the championship of the Aca
demic League will be played at
9:30' this morning on the Califor
nia Club courts. Teams repre
senting all the high schools around the
bay will take part. Owing to the increas
ing popularity of the' game a large entry
is expected.
Last year Lowell High School, repre
sented by Drummond McGavin and Al
Roser-berg, carried off the honors in* both
singles and doubles, and it looks as if that
school wiy acain be on top this year.
Lowell will be represented by Al Rosen
berg. 8nd Norman Hodgklnson. who are
by far; the best players in the league.
These two young cracks are near the top
of the second class in: the California Ten
nis Club. Rosenberg is , afflicted . with
heart trouble and may not be able to play,
and In this' case his place will be taken by
Carl Gardener in the doubles. Hodgkin
son will play the singles, as Rosenberg
Championship Tennis Tournament of the Academic Athletic League
Will Be Fdtight Out on the California Club
will play in the doubles only, if at all.
It is the intention of the managers to
finish the singles and doubles to-day, and
for this reason but one' set will be played
in the preliminary matches, two out of
three in the seml-flnals and three out of
five in the finals. If not finished Â¦ to-day â¢
the i final matches will be played next ;
Saturday morning. . â¢ , *
The most promislr-g players on the coast
at present are Drummond McGavin,
Harry Wlehe, Al Rosenberg, Norman. ;
Hodgkinson'-and Grant Smith.' One or
ntt>re of these players will undoubtedly
be champion of the coast before many
years have passed. Of the lower class
men the most promising are'Duval Mcofe,
Sidney Salisbury and Chester Smith.
McGavin- of California 'and Wiehe of
Stanford have played tennis at the Cali
fornia Club courts for years and their im
provement: in .the last few" months has
been very steady. The former ; - will play
in the championship tournament on the
Fourth of. July, but the latter. will be un
able to play on account of -a dislocated
shculder. . ,
Al Rosenberg and Norman Hodgkinson,
both' of Lowell High School, -were un
heard of till a few months ago, but are
now near the top , of ; the " second class.
Grant Smith, with 'but -three years of ex
perience to his' credit,' is well up ,in the
second ; class. ,
The tournament -'at Sacramento for the
championship of Northern California has
been engaging: the attention Â°^ ne . ";'_,,,_
cracks during the past week. The dwbU*
v was won- by Porter brothers of JV Â°Â°dIdWi.
V who defeated, the champions. Elliott and
Budgett, of Penryn. Several Â« w Â£ Itl0 "
matches were played by Professor Daily,
the professional, and R. N. Whitney, one
of the best players on the coast. -
The singles event will probably be won
by H. Elliott of Penryn. who will nave
for his opponent Allen of Woodland.
Dr. Phillip of the California Tennis Club
has been .playing a remarkable game of
late. and. although taking no part in any
of the tournaments, can give any of the
second class men a rub. The doctor, who
is nearly 50 years of age, is a marvel of
speed on the courts, and his back court,
work is very accurate.
There will be a tournament . to-day at
Kcitt's School for the championship of
that academy. There will probably be an
impromptu tournament at the California
tennis courts to-morrow.

SUIT DISMISSED APTER Â¦.Â£.Â£
PENDING HALF A CENTURY
It Had. Remained as a Cloud Upon the
Title to Private Prop
erty.
"A case that had been pending for forty
seven years In. the United States District
Court was dismissed yesterday by Judge
de Haven on motion of George D. Squires
on the ground of lack of prosecution. i
: The suit was instituted on April 14. 1854,
by Geonre* Gordon against D. G. Camp
bell. Nathaniel C. Bennett and others for
the ejectment of the defendants from the
southwest .corner, of Silver -and Second
streets. After the answer had been filed
alleging that the United. States Court had
nd Jurisdiction the plaintiff' took no fur
ther, proceedings In , the Federal Court,
hut filed' a new complaint in November,
1S54, In the Twelfth District Court of San
Francisco. '
The suit in the United States District
Court has remained on the books and as
a- cloud on the title of the property men
tioned. -Frederick E.MaRee employed Mr.
Squires to dissipate the cloud.
An. interesting feature of the case is
the fact that Nathaniel C. Bennett, one
of the defendants, .was afterward- Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of the- State

BY F. E. MULHOLLAND.
AMONG the five favorites dethroned
at Oakland track yesterday the*
defeat of no particular one
.caused more genuine regret
among the talent than that of
Sly. She was fully expected to shoulder
her 113 pounds in the free handicap, at six
furlongs, and blaze a way for Meehanus,
Hagerdon. Beau Ormonde and the others.
Heavily played at 9 to 5, the mare failed
owing to some defective steering on the
part of Pilot Bassinger. - Early in the
voyage the colored boy ran his mount Into
a. pocket, and later, while trying to get
through on the rail not far from the wire,
was again pinched, this time by Hager
don. finishing third. E. Matthews on Mee
nanus, the second choice, rode an excel
lent race, reaching home on Caesar
Young's horse more than a length before
Hagerdon in 1:13%; Beau Ormonde ran
disappointingly.
A half-dozen horses at least looked to
have a chance in the first event; a six
furlong sprint. J. Power astride the 12 to
1 shot The Miller saved considerable
ground by a short cut into the stretch,
and in a hard drive downed Almoner, a
20 to 1 -chance, a length. Decoy, the fa
vorite, ran unplaced.
"Pi" Ruiz on Yellowstone, a good-look
ing son of Rey El Santa Anita, won a
hard-earned victory in the half-mile dash
for maiden two-year-olds. After passing
e ,, t a , vorlte ' B - c - Greene. Ruiz was
?hÂ» & ? i a Par Â£ drive by R ansch. riding
the 20 to 1 outsider Hon. Peter Sterling,
which was only beaten half a length. ;
â¢ Byron Rose a hot tip for the mile and
?V . J. eentn selling event, had a close call.
Matthews on the gelding laid second to
Illilouon. the mild choice, all the way.
and though his mount ran out the last
hundred yards got the decision from the
Elm wood farm representative by a head
ran lengths away Carlovingian
In the six-furlon? number following
Bookmaker Caesar Young took another
purse, this time with Princess Titanla.
The three-year-cld filly had but ninety
pounds lo juggle, and ruled an 8 to 5
choice. Given a very warm argument by
\antine, the Princess proved the best
stayer, winning by a head on the wire.
Ralston, at 15 to 1. ran third.
After his previous good work It looked
very much as If E. Matthews lost the last
race through overconfldence with Rio
Shannon. The horse wag a 7 to 5 favorite,
and, brought from behind by degrees,
Wardman, the pacemaker, beat him out
half a length. Bathos showed improve
ment, taking show honors.

One of the neatest things in the way of
a calendar is one arranged and copyright-,

the dates set for decision the names of all
the rich racing stakes are printed, while

UNCLE HANK'S
TEAM WINS IN
NINTH INNING
Local Aggregation Captures a
Fast Game From Oakland by
Leave of Russell and Moore
San Francisco 4, Oakland 1.
For eight Innings yesterday the Dudes
and the Wasps battled for supremacy.
but the score remained the sameâ tally
to tally. In the ninth Mr. RusÂ«ell. who
occupied the slab for Oakland, took an
ascension and when he returned to terra
firma Uncle had the game tucked up his
eleeve. It was a royal exhibition and,
as usual, a small aggregation was there 1
to enjoy it.
Five double plays were made during the
same and three of them were contributed
by Messrs. Francks.Arrellanes and Streib.
Whelan and Russell pitched In good form
and the Bupport they received was excel
lent. In the ninth Russell became demor
alized and lost the game he had up to
that Inning won for his team. Moore was
partly to blame for the explosion. He
dropped Schwartz's pop-fly on foul terri
tory and then Russell allowed Schwartz
to walk. Nbrdyke did the running for the
Wasps' second baseman and the latter
took up his position in the coacher's box.
Krug sacrificed and reached the basr on
Streib's error of Moore's low throw. Hol
land bunted and Russell, in his anxiety to
land the ball, fell all over himself and
there were three on bases.
Schwartz loudly called attention to the
balloon ascension and Lohman. who was
out of humor, chlded him. Russell then
went to pieces. He hit Pabst on the arm
and Schwartz's proxy scored. Graham
flew to right and Drennan by clever work
prevented Krug from going home. Nor
dyke was given a base on balls and Krug
was forced across the rubber. Reilly was
presented with a walk and still another
Wasp flew home. Further run-making
was stopped at this juncture, when Wha
len hit to Streib. who threw home in time
to catch Pabst and Petey ' threw the ball
back to Streib in time to nail Whalen.
Drennan made a circus catch that will
be the talk in baseball circles for many
rfays. He ran from center and nailed
Pabsfs fly with the left hand. Drennan
traveled twenty yards to reach the ball
and grot it on the run. The cheer that
greeted him repaid him for his star play
and when he came In at the 'close of the
Inning the crowd arose and cheered some
more.
The flrst half of the game was extreme
ly fast.- Up to the fifth but one hit
apiece was scored. Lohman delaved the
game by protesting against Umpire Dono
hue for throwing out a new ball when
Frisco was at bat. Donohue nulled out
his timepiece, Lohman filed his protest
and the fun continued. Following is tlie
score:

THE PROGRESS OF CANADA.
OFFICIAL statistics issued by the. Canadian
Government show that the population of Can
ada is now about 6,000,000, as compared with
4,800,000 a decade a*go. The increase is equal to 23
per cent, while that of the United States during the
same period was 21 per cent. The record is one with
which most Canadians are satisfied, for it shows their
country is increasing more rapidly than they expected,
and that they are no longer losing an undue propor
tion of their young men to the United States.
In fact it appears the drift of migration. is for the
present against us rather, than in our favor, as it has
been in the past. It is said that upward of 12,000
Americans -crossed the border and made their homes
in Canada last year, and it is estimated that during
the present year the number of such settlers will be
not far, if any, short of 20,000. Moreover, the san
guine Canadians are calculating that the number of
American immigrants will "continue to increase every
year for at least a quarter of a century to come. Â»
The Klondike boom had of course. something to do
with the American immigration, for it carried to the
gold country . a considerable number of miners and
adventurers. Such immigrants, however, can hardly
be regarded as a permanent addition to the popula
tion.' A more important attraction has been the lib
eral inducements offered by the Canadian Govern
ment to settlers on the public lands of the great
northwest. In that vast region there are still- ample
lands for the landless, and enterprising men from this
as well as from other countries are hastening to take
possession of them. Â¦,
It appears the Canadian Immigration Department
has agents all 'over the farming States of, the Union,
and that the bulk of the American settlers last year
were drawn from ' Dakota, Minnesota, ' Nebraska,

CALIFORNIA is not a phylactery, but is the
stuff of which that spell "is made. In other
words, material, productive and industrial
California stands erect under the crown of scenery and
splendor so attractive to the eye and the senses.
President McKinley is upon the soil of the greatest of
the States in all the elements and capacities and re
sources which invite the energies of man for their de
velopment.
Referring to the current report of<the State Board
of Trade, the President and his Cabinet will find that
the State north of the Tehachapi Pass shipped last
3ear 8779 carloads of green deciduous fruits, and
south of that pass nineteen carloads were shipped.
Continuing the statistics as from the north and south
of that line, the north shipped of dried fruits, exclu
sive of raisins, 8490 carloads; the. south 369. The
north shipped 3421 carloads of raisins; the south 161.
The north shipped of canned goods 7852 carloads; the
south 492. The north shipped of green vegetables
2757 carloads; the south 2053. Of canned vegetables
the north produced 307 carloads; the south 4. Now,
when our visitors have got that far in the figures,
showing the supremacy of Northern California in all
those lines, let them turn to the citrus fruits, oranges,
-limes, lemons and shaddocks, and see where the su
premacy of the south lies. Southern California
shipped last year of citrus fruits the enormous quan
tity of 21,818 carloads, and the north 827.
The north shipped of wine and brandy 8789 car
loads; the south 277. The Secretary of Agriculture
already knows our beet sugar industry. For the year
ending May 31, 1900, California produced over half the
beet sugar of the United States. The board's report
says: "It is not possible to exaggerate the impor
tance of the beet sugar industry to the farmers of this
State 1 ."
Figures are tiresome, but all administration is
dealing with them, and the Cabinet transacts public
business between banquets and receptions. Califor
nia produced iii 1900 28,782,859 pounds of butter,
4,989.960 of cheese, 86,741,713 of sugar, 7,220,000 of
hops. 973,102 tons of wheat, 27,500,000 pounds of wool,
650.981.012 feet of lumber, and of metals and minerals
â antimony, asbestos, asphalt, bituminous rock, bo
rax, cement, chrome, clay, coal, copper, fuller's
earth, glass sand, gold, granite, gypsum, infusorial
earth, iron ore, lead, limestone, lithia, mica, macadam,
magnesite, manganese, marble, mineral paint, mineral
water, natural gas, onyx and travertine, paving blocks,
petroleum, platinum, pyrites, quartz sand, quicksilver,
rubble, salt, sandstone, serpentine, silver, slate, soap
stone, soda, tin â to the value of $31,000,000.
Over all this was spread the canopy of our glorious
climate, which we export in the blush and bloom of
our fruits and the sparkle of our wines, without re
ducing the original stock in the least.
California is glad to see the President, and she flat
ters herself that the gratification is mutual. If he
doesn't see what he wants while here, will he please
ask for it? .
CALIFORNIA TO THE PRESIDENT
BETWEEN the British and the Boers there are
no signs of surrender or of compromise.
Â¦Each side has evidently resolved to fight the
war out until the other is completely beaten. Every
offer of terms has been rejected by the Boers, and
any suggestion of abandoning the struggle for su
premacy is scoffed at by the British. - It is now known
that the struggle is to be a long and costly one to
the empire and a disastrous and devastating one to the
republic, but none the less neither side is willing to
yield. 1 The one will continue to send to the front new
troops, no matter- how. high the taxes rise, and the
"other will continue to uphold the cause of indepen
dence though all the skies be red with the glare of
burning homes.
< In a recent speech in Parliament Balfour said the
Boers must now be convinced that the resolution of
the British people is unalterable. Sir. Alfred Milner
says the British in South Africa upon whom the
burden of the war has fallen are as determined as are
the people. at home. In speaking of them he said:
"They are sick to death of the war, which has brought
ruin to many of them and imposed considerable sacri
fices upon all; but they would rather see the war con
tinue for an indefinite time than run' the risk of any
compromise which would* leave~even â¢* the' Yemotest
chance of the recurrence; of so. terrible a scourge in
the future. They are prepared to fight and to suffer
on in order to make South Africa, indisputably and
forever one country under one flag, with one system
of government, and that system British." \
On the other side the Boers are equally determined
to maintain their independence or perish in the at
tempt. Like the British, they are resolved to fight
the controversy to a finish now so that it may never
.rise again to devastate their country. It is reported
that a British commissioner sent out from Kroonstad
recently tried to impress upon Dewet that it is a duty
on his part to surrender and thus save his country
from further ruin and a useless sacrifice of life; In
reply-Dewet said neither he nor his people had the
slightest idea, of surrender, and with respect to the
devastation of the country he added the war would
not begin in genuine earnest until the ; farms and
towns had been so ruined , the people would have no
longer any thought about saving their possessions.
The London Chronicle recently published an.ac
count of Dewet furnished by a Dutch major who
after serving with the Boers for six months has just
returned home.. In describing the Boer hero the
writer says: "In spite of "his 44 years he looked in
the prime of life as he held out his hand to me with a
smile of recognition. One can'sce that he is conscious
of his fame, that he realizes the estimate the English
have formed of -him as the man who has been too
slim for them all. He is, however, entirely devoid of
pride or conceit. He looks upon- himself always as
a mere instrument in God's hand, for his belief in a
divine government of things is as firm as a rock. ,'If,'
he said once tea pastor, 'I had not seen things happen
in almost every fight which"' the 'mere, human intelli
gence \ would have thought impossible, and which
clearly showed the hand of God, I should long ago
have lost heart.-' *,If the war should last for years
longer he will accept' it as a purifying trial, and will
fight with the last 300 in the Northern Transvaal un
less killed or taken prisoner before."
Here, then, is a leader^ho ;is irrecon
cilable, and who expects success through his faith in
the justice of his cause. His followers are 'as ardent
as himself, and so. long as the wilds of their country
afford them a place of security from their pursuers
tncy will carry on the fight by raid after raid until their
strength is utterly exhausted. This is as true a hero
ism as was ever shown in any war, and with all their
doggedness the British cannot face it without a feel
ing.of anxiety. How long it will take to end the
struggle no one can: now foresee. . Even the British
prophets have ceased to predict that " it'-' will soon : be
brought to a close, for it now seems to be conceded
that so Jong as any number of , Boers remain with
arms in their hands the fight will . continue. ' " Â£}'â¢'Â£

COLORING MATTER-Inqulrer. City.
The color of the hair seems to depend on
the presence of a peculiar oil, which Is of
a sepia tint fn dark hair, blood-red in red
hair and yellowish In fair hair. This oil
may be extracted by alcohol or ether, and
the hair is then left a grayish-yellow tint.
The srrayness of hair in advanced life is
due to a deficiency of this oiL There are
those who hold that there is nothing that
will supply that deficiency, and that the
hair is like the branch of a tree in which
nature has- shut off the sap supply; the
branch remains and withers, in fact turns
gray, but no amount of cultivation can re
store the sap. There are others who claim
that they have discovered the secret by
which hair is supplied with the coloring
matter.

Iowa, -Michigan, Kansas,; Montana, .Wisconsin and
Illinois, j The , Government, .it is' said, Â¦ not only, offers
its land freei but it grants "subsidies for irrigation in
arid regions. Over 200 canals have already been con
structed in .various placesj bringing a million waste
acres under cultivation.
Free land will of course always be an attraction to
the Anglo-Saxon or Teutonic .race. / The great . mass
of men belonging 'to that race have ever had a desire
to be land-owners. So long.as the United States had
good lands to give away we attracted thousands of
immigrants, who came here asrnuch for the sake of
getting free land as for the sake of becoming citizens
of the republic and enjoying the blessings of our form
of government. Now that the best of our Government
lands are exhausted the land-seekers turn to the fields
of Canada. \
While everything. is thus promising for the future
and gratifying to , the Canadian optimist there are
many in the Dominion who, insist. that a population
of 6,000,000 for so large and so rich a country is noth
ing to boast of. One of that class, Seigneur Papi
neau of Montebello, a son of Louis Papirieau, who led
the revolt against Great' Britain in 1837, has recently
published an open letter in which he says: "If Can
ada had joined the Revolution, instead of remaining
a puny cofony of six- millions it would now number
over* twenty. millions. and -the whole trade of the
Northern States would have followed the natural
course of the St. Lawrence. The double belt of
Custom-houses and obstruction would have had no
existence. â¢ Toronto would have outstripped Buffalo,
and even Chicago; Montreal and Quebec would have
eclipsed Boston and New York."-
The soundness of Papirieau's statement can hardly
be questioned.. However, it is now too late in the day
to talk of what.would have happened had the French
Canadians of. the time of the Revolution sided with
the American colonists." , Having taken the course
they did,' Canada has been sidetracked for all these
years, and if now there is a beginning of a new era
in her history and a more rapid progress is about to
be achieved by her. people the United States will have
nothing but congratulations for her neighbors.
THE CUBAN TANGLE.
THERE was some surprise in this country that
the rather mild terms of the Platt resolution
..were .made the. subject of such heated discussion
in Cuba. ...... Â¦â¢ .
The resolution "gave Cuba the use of our navy,
sparing-her the expense of one of her own, and, at
least temporarily, protected her against her own inex
perience in the matters of public debt and sanitation
of her cities.
There are indications now that while the Cubans
are on independence bent they have a frugal mind.
Their violent opposition to the Platt plan is sus
ceptible of abatement and abolishment entirely in con
sideration of tariff arrangements which will give
Cuban sugar and tobacco an advantage in our market.
Much, has been said about the peppery and per
nicious character of the Cuban politicians, but it is
more and more 'apparent that they are nothing more
than the moving instruments in a combination of cos
mopolitan planters of sugar and* tobacco. These
planters are Americans, Englishmen and Spaniards,
differing in nationality and race, but all fervently de
voted to the eagle, and doubly devoted to the double
eagle as coined in our mints.
They desire to .break into our market and therein
to overrun and run out the domestic products with
which they will compete. American. protectionists see
in this sugar and tobacco politics the placing of the
first mine to '.destroy our protective system. It would
be an economic romance certainly, and perhaps an
economic tragedy, if England and the United States
change places in their trade policy. By stubborn ad
herence to the protective system this country has con
quested the trade of the world. We have distanced
Germany and overtaken Great Britain. The results
have been so conspicuous that the opponents of pro
tection have almost ceased to make it a political issue.
Is it desirable to confess judgment now, when they
have no petition filed and.no suit before the people?
If we are to abate" protection in the case of Cuban
products, where will we find argument for its main
tenance against the products of any other country?
Are we to maintain a sugar tariff, raised higher by
countervailing duties, against Germany, Holland,
France, Belgium, Russia and Austria-Hungary, while
we let Cuban sugar come in free/or with s'uch abate
ment of duty as will make the act a vicious discrimina
tion against those countries, which are also producers
of a surplus of sugar? If we so abate protection in
favor of Cuba on the score of mutual trade, how will
the account stand? In 1900 we exported to Cuba
$26,000,000 of our products, but the same year Ger
many, Holland, France, Belgium, Russia and Austria-
Hungary took of our exports $419,000,000!
Henry Clay in 1846 warned the country against the
danger to the American system involved in just such
as this Cuban proposition. If there were reasons on
his side then, how much greater. are they now? In
addition to a discrimination against countries that
took nearly a half-billion of our surplus last year, the
demand of the sugar politicians 61 Cuba strikes at a
home investment and domestic industry that it would
destroy, to the immeasurable harm of our own pro
ducers. There are in operation in this country forty
beet sugar factories, with an invested capital of $30,
000,000. The farmers of Michigan, Ohio, New York",
Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Nebraska,
Colorado, Utah, Oregon, Washington, Dakota, and
California have turned to the sugar beet as a profit
able rotating "crop. â¢Notwithstanding the very low
ruling price of sugar J they have found the industry
to pay. They cannot compete with Cuban sugar at
any reduction in tariff protection. The capital in
vested in the mills would have to find its profit either
in raising the price of sugar, which it .cannot do, or
in lowering the price paid to 1 the farmer for the raw
material. When this depression passed the point of
his endurance the farmer would abandon/beet culture,
and our agriculture would lose that profitable varia
tion in crops.
It is known by protectionists that the latter strength
of that policy has come from the alliance between the
manufacturing and the agricultural classes, and it is
also known that this alliance depends upon the pro
tection of sugar, tobacco, rice and wool. In the case
of sugar and tobacco the influence is especially strong.
Every acre devoted to either is thereby taken out pi
competition in corn and small grain. Every acre
upon which Cuban sugar and tobacco obsoletes the
culture of either is returned to competition with corn
and small grain. So this issue, by impingement, af
fects an immense class of agriculturists who raise
neither sugar nor tobacco, but are the beneficiaries of
the withdrawal- of sugar and tobacco lands from com
petition. â¢
The demand of the Cuban planters may be more
concentrated, its focus may be more powerful; it is
capable of more effective organization; but weÂ»raise
the voice of warning now that the American interest
in the issue.affects millions, and the result will impress
those States which control the politics of this country.
size and shape of the earth has been com
puted, but the problem Is so complex
that, for its solution, the co-operationi or
all civilized nations has been invoked and
obtained by International agreement. The
Coast and Geodetic Survey has contrib
uted as its share toward our knowledge
of -this important Question -one of the
longest measured areas, extending from
the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, along
the thirty-ninth parallel of latitude, and a
Fhortef one extending from Maine to
Louisiana.
Since the work of the Coast and Geodetic
Survey covers such a wide territory and
consists oft such varied operations, it has
been possible only to suggest in the fore
going outline its general character and
utility. The methods and results have
been pronounced by many eminent men.
who were themselves in charze of survey
work to be . unexcelled by those of any
other nation.
ized work of the coast survey developed
its existence. Had it been known in lra
D'Eslaing's fleet might have passed Into
the bay, the British fleet might have been
destroyed and the- Revolutionary vvar
might have been shortened by several
years.
Work Done by the Coast Survey. . ,
To further illustrate, take the facts In
the case of the early maps of Delaware
Bay. Cape Henlopen and Cape May
lights were laid down all the way from
four and one-half to seven miles too far
apart.* A survey based on shore points
accurately determined developed other
errors in this bay equally large* The light
at Bombay Hook, the leading "mark for
running up the bay,- was found to be
five miles out of position.' The deepest
and most sheltered channel in the widest
part Â¦ of the bay was supposed to be al
most a shoal. The list of such inaccur
acies could be lengthened indefinitely.
Â¦ If such were the conditions along thf
main thoroughfares of trade It may be
imagined how little reliance cquld be
placed on charts ! of other portions of the
Atlantic coast. If they were less faulty
it is no doubt owing to the fact that the
nature of. the region afforded fewer op
portunities for error. The chart3 of the
gulf coast were made up from a patch
work of heterogeneous Information, while
those of the California coasts were tne re
sults of exploring expeditions and had no
exact basis. *
Fortunately these conditions are a mat
ter of history now. In so far as they relate
to the Atlantic, gulf and Pacific coasts of
the United States and a portion of Alas
ka. ' Over 500 charts of different scales
to suit the various wants of the mari
ner are published. They range from, a
sailing chart of a small scale covering
long stretches of coast to the large scale
harbor chart. On the latter the topogra
phy, has been so minutely detailed that in
many cases Individual houses are repre
sented. The adjacent water areas have
likewise received the closest examination
to develop the characteristic features of
the bottom and to discover all hidden dan
gers. At critical places the -depths are
given to the nearest half foot. Since it
is impossible to put all the navigational
information on the charts they are sup
plemented by such publications as the
"Coast Pilots," the "Tide Tables" and
the "Notices to Mariners."
Constant Changes of the Coast.
The work of an organization devoted to
the survey and charting of a coast like
ours never ceases. Under water, as well
as along the water's edge, tidal currents
and storm waves are constantly operating
to produce change, while on shore the
aspect of the country is being continually
altered by a denser settlement, old land
marks being destroyed and new ones ap
pearing. Therefore, the shores and ad
jacent-waters of our immediate coasts will
always need constant supervision and pe
riodical revision, while Alaska and the
Philippine Islands will tax the ehergies
of the survey for years to come.
Few people are aware of the number
and relative Importance of the different
operations which precede the construc
tion of a modern chart. Since its chief
function is to show thÂ£ depth of the
water the hydrography generally occu
pies the larger space and Is the most con
spicuous feature. It should, however, be
understood that it is but one of the op
erations. Like the soundings obtained by
the leadsman, which form the larger part
of the hydrographic notes, it is dependent
for its value on other work Quite as Im
portant. . /
The topography, next to the hydrogra
phy, occupies on the chart the greatest
saace and attracts more attention than
the remainder of the Information. Be
sides being useful to the mariner to lo
cate his whereabouts on the water, it is
studied with reference to military defense,
harbor improvements and other engineer
ing problems which come up for solution
in the vicinity of great commercial thor
oughfares. The topographer, like the hy
drogapher, is also dependent on the la
bors of others for the necessary trigo
nometric control which gives his work the
required accuracy.
Magnetic Currents.
The magnetic work of the survey is only
represented on the chart by one or more
compass diagrams, which show the
amount of the deviation of the needle
from the north for a certain date, and its
annual change. In order correctly to draw
these diagrams, make the predictions for
them and study the laws governing the
movements of the needle, the survey has
determined the magnetic elements at a
large number of stations along the coasts
and throughout the interior of our terri
tory, and is constantly adding new sta
tions and revisiting the old ones.
The results of this work are not only or
vital importance to the mariner but of the
greatest necessity to every survevor of
the land. Many boundary disputes involv
ing .large sums of money have been defin
itely settled by recourse to the surveyor's
publications on this subject, which are
received as final authority by the courts.
The results of another field of observa
tion and research, the tides, only appear
on thfi chart in the form of a small table.
Yet to obtain the necessary data for its
construction, the observations of the tides
at many points along the coasts, and cov
ering a period of many years, have^been
collected and studied. The j tables, which
are published in book form, are predicted
in the office of the survey a year in ad
vance, and are ready for distribution In
ample, time for mailing- to distant agencies
before the date when they come into use.
Their contents appear in the daily press
of the country in the shape of daily pre
dictions of local tide.
Other Features -of the Service.
From the astronomical work of the sur
vey is derived the small table containing
\ the geographical positions (the latitudes
and longitudes) of the. principal light
houses which are shown on the chart. It
also controls through the triangulatlon all
other .geographical positions. Besides
this, every city and town in the United
States which has its longitude accurately
known is Indebted to the telegraphic long
itude system, of the survey.
That branch of. the work which fur
nishes the framework for constructing the
chart is not represented on the published
chart at all. This is the trlangulatlc-n. It
controls the work of the. topographer and
hydrographerby^ supplying points whose
distances and directions are known, and
by means of which each . feature on the
chart is properly related to every other
feature and is assigned its correct geo
graphical position. The completed trian
gulation system i extending alonjr the
coasts, and also through the interior of
the continent, furnishes to three-quarters
of the States of the Union exact distances
and geographical positions on which to
base . their topographic surveys.
In addition, as part of the trigonometric
systems, the eastern half of the. United
Slates ; has been i covered with Â¦ a network
of precise. level circuits, and bench, marks
giving the heights above mean sea level
have, been , freely distributed over the
whole area_for the. benefit of engineers
This system will be extended to the Pa
cific Coast.
Â¦ .Supplying Earth Measurements.
"â¢Â¦' It is. not at all surprising that from the
earliest time man should have speculated

on which he lives. -The first definite step

XIHâ COAST AND G EODETTC SUB VEY.
All maritime nations, recognizing their
large share of responsibility for the safety
of the ships which frequent the navigable
waters within their domain, maintain es
tablishments organized to chart'-: the
coasts, to mark the dangers, and as these
safeguards at times In stress weather
prove unavailing they provide a means to
rescue life from imminent disaster.
Quick voyages and light risks find their
reflection in correspondingly small insur
ance ; premiums and low charter rates.
These charges being placed on the com
modities of trade, any decrease in their
amount benefits either producer or con
sumer, wherever he may be. The rapid
development and enormous increase of
our commerce would^ have been impossi
ble without the faithful execution of the
carefully planned measures of this Gov
ernment In the interests of the ocean car
rying trade.' The United States coast and
geodetic survey has â¢ shared in the im
portant work designed to carry out tylils
enlightened policy from the, time of its
organization.'
The survey had Its > beginning in 1S07,
when Thomas Jefferson recommended to
Congress its establishment, and soon aft
erward Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the
Treasury, addressed a circular to eminept
scientific men 1 inviting 1 their views on the
best method j of conducting a systematic
survey of our coasts. The plan finally
adopted was submitted by Ferdinand Ru
dolph Hassler, a Swiss by, birth, a man
versed in the art of conducting extensive
surveys and woll fitted by- his knowledge
and indomitable spirit to inaugurate a
great enterprise.
The task which he and his successors
set themselves to perform was to make a
trigonometric survey of the, coasts in ac
cordance with the most approved means
which modern science affords, using al
ways the most approved methods and in
struments: the topography . to be carried
as far inland as might be necessary for
proper delineation of the shore for pur
poses either .of commerce or of defense,
and with soundings of the adjacent waters
within twenty leagues of the shove, and
inland to the head of ship navigation or
tidal influence.
Keeping pace with the territorial expan
sion of our country, the operations of the
survey were extended successively to the
Florida and Texas .coasts, to California
and the shores of the Pacific as far as the
Straits of Fuca, and later on to Alaska,
with its vast length of -intricate shore
line, stretching from the historical paral
lel of latitude "54:40" northward to the
frozen ocean, and comprising witnin its
limits the remarkable chain of the Aleu
tion Islands, projecting westward for a
distance of over 1000 miles from the main
land. . â¢ '. .
Further Extension of the Work.
â¢ In order to connect the surveys on the
Pacific Coast with those on the Atlantic
a transcontinental triangulation extend
ing from shore to shore was authorized,
and the word "geodetic", was added to the
name of the organization, making it the
'coast and geodetic survey. .'â¢ ":
Yet more recently, after, the Spanish
war, the survey was directed b> Con
gressional legislation to include within its
scope the coasts of the countries under
the jurisdiction of the United States.
The plan upon which it was organized
and the methols it employs are the out
growth of trial and experience from the
time of its inception. Under the direction
i of a superintendent there are two great
i divisions of its workâ the field and the of
fice divisions. The field Includes all the
practical operations of the survey on land
and sea. The office is that part of the es
tablishment where the results obtained in
the field are received, digested, prepared
1 for publication and finally published.
The chief product of its work is the
chart, which Is an illustration of the most
: effective use of sign language. It'repre
sents in a most condensed form a large
amount"~of information in a manner to be
quickly read and comprehended without
; effort. On account of its simplicity, of
i representation a slight alteration of any
of its characters may lead to dangerous
consequences. The -shifting of a light
house symbol here or the omission of a
rocky ledge symbol there would be a suf
ficient cause to wreck a ship.
Value of the Charts to Mariners.
There are few fields of fwork where ac
curacy and faithful attention to details
are more necessary than in chartmaking.
The chart by showing the landmarks,
beacons and' buoys in their true relation
to the deep water and the shoals enables
the mariner to pick his way over the
shortest and safest course, to his destin
ation. This is Its. chief value in fair
weather. It renders a still more important
service in foul weather, when these guid
ing marks are hidden from view. Sur
rounded on all sides by an Â»fmpenetrable
curtain of mist the navigator seeks below
the surface of the waves the information
denied him above them. By means of his
lead line he measures the depth of the
water and < ascertains the .nature of the
bottom. Comparing these with the sound
ings on the chart he verifies, or, perhaps,
modifies the position assumed by reck
oning from the last point of departure.
He then proceeds on his way with confi
dence and if he is prudent repeats this
process until the air clears or hisÂ» course
carries him : far outside all danger: Oh
approaching the coast,, but still out : of
sight of land, the same, method Is pur
sued to check the reckoning and to add
to the precision of the navigation of the
ship. Precise navigation demands ; pre
cise surveys and the faithful and distinct
representation of their results in the
form of a chart. A perfect chart should
be like Caesar's wife, above suspicion.'
Gross inaccuracies are the fruitful source
of disaster and a chart of doubtful . ac
curacy is the cause of delay. In this
day of high speed and Quick sale for ready
cargoes, time Is money, and lost , time
means increased coal consumption ' and
the increased expenditures . or smaller
profits always coincident with uncertain
service.' '' 'Â¦ ,- '
Former Ignorance of Our Coasts. Â¦
.. What the Coast and Geodetic Survey has
accomplished toward the safety of naviga
tion along our coasts can be more clearly
illustrated by giving some. of the notable
examples of the condition of the | charts
of our coasts - existing at the time it be
gan work. ' v .%. ,. .:Â¦-,Â¦
The charts of that period appear, to have
been compiled from surveys made by the
English, and Spanish previous to the War
of Â¦ the-. Revolution. There was then.no
systematic plan of operation based on
correct methods, as at .present, and car
ried on '.by- a -.body of men trained in the
practice â¢ of : purveying for.' years and Â¦ pur
suing It as their life's .vocation. ' . .

CHINESE GET AROUND
THE EXCLUSION LAW
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 10.â "Canada
gets the $100 Chinese poll tax, while the
United States pets the Chinese," were the
words this afternoon of Chief Commis
sioner Clute. now inquiring into the Chi
nese immigration question for the Federal
Government. The remark of Commission
er Clute was caused by the sworn state
ment of Yip Yon. secretary of the Chinese
Board of Trade of British Columbia, that
75 per cent of the Chinese immigrants to
Canada were promptly smuggled into the
United States; that from Vancouver alone
he had personally known that during
March and April 200 Chiaese were safely
smuggled into the State ot Washington.
Yip Yon further said that as a Christian
under oath he would say that he believed
that If Canada stopped Chinese immi
grants for five years there would be very
few Chinese left In Canada. One of the
CÂ«nmissioners asked Yip Yon whither
those now here would go. and he an
swered that nearly all of them would get
Into the States some way, while some
would go to China. Generally speaking,
all roads from China lead to the Linited
States. While great numbers were com
ing into Canada, the numbers of Chinese
in Canada were decreasing yearly.
Further evidence was to the effect that
Chinese coolies ware so eager to raise the
necessary $200 to get into the States via
Canada that they mortgaged their. wives
end children in eome cases. It sometimes
happened that the mortgagees foreclosed
end seized the human ciiattels as slaves.
They disposed cf the women and children
at the end of three years from the date
of the seizure, according to the Chinese
law or custom, which allows the friends
of the slaves tne privilege of buying their
freedom after that time. f

METHEVER'S LIFE
Dorothy McKee's Mur
derer Is Hanged, in
San QuentiiL
Faces D eath With Firmness
and Makes No Parting
Statement.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, May 10.â The
last scene' in Edward V. Methever*s life
was completed to-day when his body shot
through the gallows trap in the old fur
niture â¢ factory building.. The . execution
took place at 10:30 o'clock this morning.
The condemned man walked up the gal
lows steps with firm tread. He said noth
ing and seemed oblivious to the presence
of all save Father Robert Sesnon, his
spiritual adviser, who attended him to the
last. ' ' â¢ , â¢ " Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦ '.'â¢
' Eleven minutes after the drop tha phy
sicians pronounced j life extinct.
Before the. march to the gallows began
Methever thanked all present for their
kindness to him and said that he bore no
ill will toward any one; that he toad com
mitted a grave crime and was content to
die.
The crime for which Methever suffered
the extreme penalty was committed on
July 25, 1899. On that day he cruelly mur
dered pretty, Dorothy McKee at Long
Beach. She was but 23 years old, while
Methever was in the sixties. Methever,
who was a snoemaker, went to Long
Beach In the spring- and opened a small
store in a part of the building in which
Miss McKee's mother kept a delicacy
store. The old man had paid some atten
tion to Miss McKee and she had been a
good friend, called him "father" and tend
ed his shop occasionally.
On the night before the murder Dorothy
accepted the invitation of a young man to
Â¦accompany him on a walk. This -action
excited the Jealousy of Methever. â¢ The
next morning Miss McKee and a friend
from Los Angeles went for a bicycle ride,
and as they were riding along the beach
Methever rode up. ran his wheel into that
ridden by Miss McKee and shot her,' kill-
Ing her Instantly. He then placed the re
volver at his own head and fired, inflict
ing a wound from which he did not recov
er for several weeks and which caused
him to lose his right eye..

Nine Most Elegantly Furnished Flats for
rent and the Furnishings for Sale on Park
Panhandle==tllis=street car line.
f â "\ /^ â^\ - r /P 1
Out on Cole street, comer of Oak street,' opposite the Park Panhandle, is a building â just
finishedâwhich contains 9 flats, not apartments, but distinctly separate flats; each flat has its own
entrance. These flats are for rent, and the Furniture, Carpets and Curtains are for sale â each flat
as a whole. These flats are open for your inspection Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 8 till 12
a. m. and from 1 till 5 p. m., also Friday and Saturday evenings from 7 till 10 o'clock.
It is'not a matter of guesswork when we affirm that we are offering each of these flats for
from $5 to $10 less rental per month than any similar flats could be rented for at the present time,
for it stands to reason that any owner will gladly accept a low offer when he can lease his whole
building to us for a whole year â and the benefit is yours. .
To sell as low as we are offering . the furnishings of the above illustrated flats, there must ,
be large selling and large manufacturing in order to get all the advantages.
Gushing in print would be absurd when simple facts are all we need to make the deepest im*
pressions.
Each separate flat has been furnished with due regard for price, and we have so considered
the popular demand that notwithstanding the extreme beauty andjntrinsic value of the furnish-
ings, not a single article is above the ordinary in price.
It will be impossible in print to touch upon some of the most interesting features of the dif-
ferent styles and coloring in the Furniture, Carpets or Draperies, so complete, so novel and so be-
wilderingly beautiful, and we simply say it must be seen to be appreciated. .
" Of course, ladies, you are all welcome to look, with no thought of buying unless you find
it to vour interest and advantage to do so.

As a matter of fact, there seems to be
no reason for doubting that both inter
ests have control so far as stock in their
possession plus contracts for delivery are
concerned, but which interest will event
ually be able to vote a control in the form
of actual certificates remains to be seen,
and will, it Is to-night believed, not be
definitely known until the annual meeting
in the fall. â¢ .-
J. J. Hill, on the other hand, however,
was cuite as decisive in reiterating his
previous statements that "the control has
not chanced."
It is noticeable that discussion to-night
centers upon the . Question of control of
the Northern Pacific. So far as actual
control is concerned, the impression is
gaining ground that it will be the party
with the most money that will acquire it.
Many of the daily papers and some of the
financial papers to-day expressed the be
lief that control of the Northern Pacific
was still vested in the Morgan-Hill party.
On the other hand, one of the leading pa
pers of the city and some of the financial
organs of the street still express the opin
ion that the Harriman party is in control.
One thing seems settled to-night.- and that
is that Kuhn. Loeb & Co. do not yet ad
mit defeat. Late to-day Otto H. Kuhn of
,thc firm did not hesitate to eay, "We be
lieve we have control."
NEW YORK, May 10.â The very, fact
that there will be no trading until next
Monday morning, it is â¢ said, gives the
leaders in the stock market, men like Hill,
Harriman, Vanderbilt, Morgan, Rocke
feller and Stillman, time to compare notes
and exchange views.
Blair & Co., who represent a large
number of Burlington stockholders, have
assured their clients that the deal will go
through. Similar statements from other
investment houses have also been made.
QUESTION OF N. P. CONTROL.
James .J. Hill, president of the Great
Northern, also asserts that there is no
danger that the deal will fall through
unless the stockholders of the Burlington
object. Â¦' . '
"According to the terms of the offer,"
said Hill, "the deal becomes binding the
moment two-thirds of the : Burlington
stock is deposited. Wall street seems to
have lost sight of the statement fo prom
inently brought out in Hunnewell's circu
lar that the deal depends wholly upon
the acceptance of the offer by the Eur
llngton's stockholders. The transaction
does not have to be ratified by the stock
holders of the Northern Pacific or the
Great Northern. The directors of those
roads have made the offer, which becomes
binding at the option of the Burlington
road."
When the news first came out that the
fight was on for control of the Northern
Pacific and the positive statement made
that Kuhn, Loeb & Co. had acquired con
trol of the road, Burlington stock, which
was well maintained at 199, showed signs
of weakness. This was. due to the gen
eral belief that the new element supposed
to be in control of the Northern Pacific
would not ratify the purchase jf the Bur
lington at the price officially offered to
stockholders of the latter road. In Thurs
day's panic the stock suffered severely and
the low price of $178 a share was made. At
the close of business to-day Burlington
recovered to $191 a share.
In speaking of the matter to-day Otto
H. Kuhn of Kuhn. Loeb & Co. said: -
"In my opinion the Chicago, Burlington
and Quincy purchase will go through with
out any doubt. Further, I believe share
holders of the Burlington road will receive
for their stock the price alreadv an
nounced regardless of whatever may de
velop as to the control of the Northern
Pacific."
NEW TORK, May 10.â Very positive as
surances were given to-day by the finan
cial syndicates claiming: control of the
Northern Pacific Railroad that' there was
no cause for alarm regarding the outcome
of the Burlington "deal" and both author
ize the statement that there Is absolutely
no foundation for reports that in case the
Northern Pacific control changes hands
the Burlington merger will be abandoned.

Yesterday's tremendous business on
the Stock Exchange was reflected in to
day's exchange of bank checks, which
nirsregated 5SSK.n37.43O. and which broke
ihe record of $362,817,200 made on Tuesday
last. The balances were $23^73,116, the
second largest on record, and comparing
TR-ith the record of $24,170,338 on March 5.
Tho commission houses generally were
averse to accepting much new business to
day. About one-third of the commission
houses would only take buying orders
from customers who could pay for, them
in full, and others required such excessive
margins as to restrict trading- greatly.
The heaviest buyers came from the syn
dicates that have been active In arranging
dc-als for the absorption of other proper
ties. These interests seemed to regard
the developments yesterday- as the most
favorable thing- that co-uld have happened
for the carrying out of their plans and
accumulation of stocks by them was re
sumed on a large scale during the day.
This buying was so large that the supply
of stocks was continuously exhausted and
many orders at fairlv high limits could
not be filled.
It is a. remarkable fact that the unpre
cedented violence of Thursday's upset
should have resulted in not a single fail
ure on the Stock Exchange.
measures will want to be gauged before
adequate judgment can be passed upon
the outlook.
Some of the more notable of the day's
advances were: Union Pacific, 23 points;
St. Paul and Lackawanna. 17^2 each. Con
solidated Gas 36. Burlington and Amalga
mated Copper 12*4. International Power
in*. Baltimore and Ohio 11. St. Louis and
Southwestern preferred J0*4, Sugar. Dela

This represents a rapid rate of recovery
frcn the extreme low prices of Thursday.
Â¦wi-?ch had already been largely recove'-*>d
in the violent rebound of the late trad
ing on the exchange. There was an obvi
nria disposition to hall this as a revival
of t"he boom on the part of some mci<.>
ranjruine -Â©f the speculative, bull element.
But after the week's experience of the se
vere penalties of overspeculation a renew
al of the same was strongly deprecated.

lapre as that of Thursday are nor to be

V More Notable Advances.
The bargain hunters were also on hand
In Wall street to-day, although their op
erations fell away as the recovery in
prices progressed. During the morning,
however, a large number of transactions
were recorded for cash, both In stocks and
bonds, which is the manner in which the
bargain hunter usually pays for his pur
chases. There Is a belief in the street that
yesterday's panic was made unnecessarily
violent by the excitement of some of the
newer members of the Stock Exchange,
many of whom are very young men. It is
supposed that some of these made undue
sacrifices in the chaotic conditions on
Thursday. There was some buying back
of stocks from these sources and also
by those who got out in time early in the
wees and wanted to get back. To-mor
row'a-impending holiday, it was felt. In
cured a. period for calm reflection, which
must tend to clear the situation still fur
ther. There was also seme -manipulation
at prices for the relief of those whose
borrowing had been largely impaired by
The shrinkage in collateral values. Some
fif this manipulation was also with the
view, of the benefit of the London market,
where there is a periodical settlement- on
Monday, which is much dreaded by the
English operators In America, owing to
the heavy declines since the last settle
ment, which will have to be made good.
Bargaiu-Hunters on Hand.
With the threatening: conditions re
moved, a rebound in prices was natural
and In evidence. The extent to which it
ran was. however, a surprise and was at
tributed to various causes. There is no
Â«loubt that among those who were heavy
losers !n yesterday's slump were many or
ample resources, who viewed the situation
with a eporting instinct and a determina
tion to recoup losses by following the
nÂ»arfcet. It was the popular belief that
some of the Western potentates who were
admittedly forced to "walk sideways"
during a portion of yesterday's events
were again in the market this afternoon
in Â«. bold attempt to retrieve their losses.
The obvious leadership of the movement
of Union Pacific and the Southwestern
group gave gTound for the conjecture that
it was based on benefits expected to ac
crue to Union Pacific from a control of
Northern Pacific, a control which . was
etill stoutly claimed to-day, but as em
phatically denied by the Hill-Morgan par
ties. It was remarkable that the break
ing of the corner in Northern Pacific by
the settlement with the shorts at $150
brought almost no stock upon the mar
ket. But it is evident that the contest
ing parties in Northern Pacific are not
yet prepared to let go of a single availa
ble share of the stock. The settlement
with the shorts progresped to-day at the
efflces both of Kuhn. Loeb & Co. and J. P.
Morgan & Co., and it is probable that
only the completion of the settlement will
reveal how much of the purchases of
stock made by the two parties within the
last week can be delivered.

the campus jammed with people. The
police refused to allow him to locate at
any particular point and he drove from
one spot to another, the crowd following.
The mob frequently blocked traffic ana
the police attempted to disperse them. It
was but a moment-before stones began
to fly through the air, and a general mix
up followed, in which the foot police used
their clubs and the mounted men charged.
The policemen fired their pistols In the air
and the- mob returned the fusillade wltix
bricks and cobblestones. At one time,
when the mob had gathered about the
Central police station at Fort and Ran

the windows. â¢ -

At one stage cf the riot a section of hose
was secured by order of the police direc

but the hose was cut and the man who
wielded the nozzle was driven into a sa

Iron cuspidor. _'
Mayor Maybury was downtown -watch
ing the crowd and at one time made a
speech to the people from the postofflce
steps, cautioning them to do no violence,
but stated that he was not in sympathy
with the order of Police Director Andrews
denying free speech en the public streets.
At 11 o'clock to-night the mob had grad

city was Quiet. \ Â¦*
Twelve Citizens and Five Officers . Are Injured
During a Period of Tumult and Terror on
the Streets of the -City in the Night.
DETROIT. May lCâ Ten thousand men
and boys ran riot in the main streets- of
this city for more than three hours to
night and a continual running tight with
police, both mounted and on foot, caused
ereat excitement In the heart of the city.
The net result as far as known is twelve
citizens and' five policemen injured. . The
names of but two citizens are known at
present. They are Michael Waldin and.
Louis Â«Â£aplin. Both had their heads
bruised^ by being trampled on by horses
ridden by, the mounted police In a charg^
on the crowd.
The officers injured are: James Tuomsy,
scalp cut by brick; Henry Scott, hit on
head with cobblestone; Thomas Murphy,
cheek cut open with brick ; George Moore,
badly cut about head by brick, taken
home In ambulance; Barney Roonan,
struck with a brick.
The beginning of the riot was last
night, when " Director of Police Andrews,
who recently superseded the old police
board through the passage of the Ripper
bill by the Legislature, issued an order
to the police to allow no one to stand
about -the wagon of. Tom Bawden, a local
single-tax exhorter, who had incurred the
ill-will of the police director by the ex
traordinary nature of his remarks on so
called wealthy - "tax-dodgers."
When Bawden began his exhortation a
crowd quickly gathered. Director An
drews supervised the work of the police
in keeping the people moving. The crowd
good naturedly hooted at the police, and
no violence was done. 'v i
To-night, .however, the temper of the
crowd changed when It was announced
that Director Andrews had called on re-:

Makes Charge of Bribery.
YI- tjONOLULU, May 4.â The 'first
i 1 1 Territorial Legislature of Ha-
I I waii came to an end on tr.e
Jl JJL evening of April 30. according to.
; _. Governor Dole,; and' oh the next'
night, according to the majority in "both'
House and Senate. The LegislatureÂ«Â«ndâ¬d
its existence at loggerheads with the Gov
ernor r.ll along the line and without hav
ing passed a' single brie of- the important
measures to which the Home Rulers were
committed, except the county government
act, which the Governor has killed by- a
pocket veto.
The last act of theHouse on the even
ing of the 30th was to pass a concurrent
resolution containing a memorial to Pres-.
ident McKinley asking for the removal of
Governor Dole.. It was introduced by
Representative Beckley, one of the native
Home Rulers, and contains along indict
ment of the executive. Dole is- charged:
with having hindered the work of the ses-,
sion by his hostility toward the Legisla
ture, , withholding -information and reports
that were called for and refusing to co
operate with the lawmakers. The resolu
tion sets forth that the Legislature came
together at a time when many very im-
portant problems, -.resulting from the
change of '.government, confronted ' the
members and that though It was the .first
Legislature Hawalians . had had a cnance'
to elect for many", years Dole refused to
grant them any extension of time for pas
sage of necessary laws. . - . - - -,
i Ask. for Dole's Removal. \ j
The President Is asked in the resolution
to use his influence in behalf of an extra
session of the Legislature, which Dole re
fuses to. grant. The Hawalians claim that
they have not had time in which to work
out the plans of. lawmak*ig they had
formed in the thirty days of the regular
session. In conclusion the Home Rulers
ask that Dole be removed, if the President
sees no other way to bring about an ex
tra session of fhe Territorial Legislature,
declaring that-the Governor has acted In
such a manner' as to lose the confidence
of a majority ..of the people 'Of the Ter
ritory and charging that he has not dealt
fairly with the Home Rule Legislature. Â¦
The concurrent resolution - passed both
houses by large majorities,, all the native
Home Rule members voting for it. It did
not pet to the Senate until Jhe day after
the end of the session, as calculated . by
the Governor, but- on that day the 'native
party in the Senate passed it.* - :Â¦-
A review of the work of the Legislature
shows -that -the most Important' laws
enacted were an income tax law; assessing
2 per cent on all incomes above $1000, and
an act providing for a -court to : hear
claims for. damages- resulting from the
Chinatown fire 'and appropriating a\mil
lion and. a half-dollars to pay the claims
iÂ«.at may be allowed.- The loan bill failed
to get through, many Home Rulers refus
ing -to work for -it: after they were In
formed that Governor Dole would not
grant an extra, session except for appro
priations. The failure of the bill will tie
up public Â« improvements Â¦Â¦',. for . two years
.unless there is an extra session. â¢ .

GOVERNOR SAYS
HE WAS SNUBBED
Declares He Was Not In-

Los Angeles Reception
LOS ANGELES. May 10.â Since the de
parture of the Presidential party the fail
ure of the fiesta committee to ofiBcially in
vite Governor Gage to take part in the re
ception to the President has been the sub
ject of considerable comment. In an in
terview to-day regarding the matter Gov
ernor Gape said:
"I have no personal feeling In the mat
ter whatsoever and do not wish to put
myself in a position by which anybody
may imagine that I, as an Individual, have
suffered any Indignity. I â¢ have fulfilled
my dutyâ and a very proud and pleasant
one â of welcoming our great President to
California as the State's chief executive.
There my duty for the present ended."
When asked if he had been invited to
take part In any Â«f the functions
in this city the Governor reiterated that
he did not care to be Interviewed, but
finally positively declared that he had
never received any written invitation to
take any part In the proceedings, but that
at the eleventh hour he had been ap
proached by Messrs. Laughlin and Rule,
when it was Impossible for him to change
his plans. This was all that Governor
Gage would vouchsafe on the subject.

Hay Commute Sentence in Con-

WASHINGTON, May 10.â The Depart
ment of Justice has forwarded to the
President an opinion to the effect that the
executive has a right to commute the een
tence of a prisoner for contemDt of court
and it Ia expected that the President will
release Alexander McKenzie. the Ncme
mine receiver, now in prison at Oakland,
Cal., upon this opinion of his right to do
s<J under the law.
No mention is made in the opinion, it Is
understood, of legal grounds upon which
tho President might exercise the oardpn
power in such a case, the law being: cited
only in regard to his right to commute
sentence. It is said the President intends to
confer with the United States Judges In
San- Francisco against whom McKenzie
was in contempt and secure their astcnt

- HONOLULU, May 4.â United , j States
District * Attorney Baird created a sensa
tion in District Judge Estee' s court yes
terday morning by roundly denouncing
a jury that had failed to convict Captain
Sodergren of the bark Hesper on a charge
of assault and battery .on the high seas.
The â¢ captain was convicted on onÂ©; count
and is under sentence of six months' hard
labor. " Another charge, was brought
against him by his cabin boy, Edward
Hanlin, but the jury brought in a verdict
of not guilty.
' When the case of' William Walsh, was
called . yesterday, the charge being a
similar one, Baird refuse"d to proceed,
saying that the verdict of the jurors in
the previous case was a travesty on jus
tice and that It was a waste of time and
United States money to go ahead with
such a jury. A number of prominent
citizens were on the jury and the remarks
of the District Attorney created a sensa
tion In the city. He entered a nolle prose
qui and at his request Judge Estee dis
charged the whole Jury from further
duty.
Judge Estee expressed himself as agree
ing with Baird. He declared that the evi
dence plainly showed that Captain Sod
ergren had inhumanly assaulted the com
plaining witness six times. *
There are many stories of brutality on
the Hesper on her last trip here. Walsh,
who goes free as a result of the District
Attorney's nolle prosequl, was her mate.
Captain Sodergren ia appealing against
the sentence of six months' hard labor
passed upon him by Judge Estee.

mained- while his house burned to the

"I saw the President," said he, when
informed that his house was in ruins. "I
saved the lot anyway."
After leaving Ventura the train ran for
miles along the cliffs, which, at this point
rise abruptly from the sea. At Summer
land the President saw the derricks of oil
wells sunk in the ocean.
Enters the Sacred Garden.
At the mission the President was re
ceived by the fathers and conducted Into
the sacred garden. Preparations had been
made by the Franciscans to show Mrs.
McKinley through this garden as a spe
cial mark of respect, for no women except
the wives of Presidents have ever been
admitted. Mrs. Grant was thus honored.
The forty. students of. St. Anthony's Col
lege were drawn up In line at one side of
the garden and were addressed by the
President, who admonished them to lead
useful lives and wished them happiness.
The party was shown through the chapel,
the cemetery and Ihe relic room and took
carriages for their train. The President
hurried to his wife's side as . soon as he
was allowed to reach the car. .-Â¦-Â¦*. -\ '
The -Presidential party is having a
pleasant time, unless it be that the con
stant strain upon the President becomes
annoying. At the mission to-day Secre
tary Hitchcock said to Postmaster Gener

."It will be hard for us to get into the
harness again and go to plowing when we
get home. A man does not get an outing
like this very often."
Promptly -on schedule time the party
reassembled at VicU.ria station, but one
member/Lawrence I. Scott, wag missing.
The train waited ten minutes and pulled
out without him; - It was hardly out of
sight before he arrived In a hack.
Pleased With the Weather.
There were many amusing incidents
during the day. A member of the recep
tion committee spoke apologetically of the
overcast sky to the' President, who re
sponded: . " . .
"It may shut out your mountain view,
but it is delightful weather."
Rubbing his nose, liee ontlnued: "Look
at my nose; I have been In the scorching
sun so much, on this. trip that I am sun
burned and my face its quite sore."

pense of Secretary Hitchcock regarding
the Arizona Indians,* which Secretary
Hitchcock had exhibited to the party as
"his" Indians. t
Mayor of San Luis Obispo delivered the
address of welcome as McKinley stepped
from his carriage. The crowd cheered as
McKinley bared his head in the twilight
and bowed. He spoke to them as follows:
It gives me. great pleasure to receive the
greetings of the people given so cordially
and so generously by the Mayor of your
town. The ambition ct every American Is
for the well being of his country, for he
knows If all goes well with his country all
Is likely to go well with him. In a country
like ours, resting as it does upon the judg
ment of the people, our Government and its
administration, our laws and our courts are
very much what the people make them.
They elect their Legislatures in the several
States: they elect their Judges and estab
lish their courts; they make their own laws
for the government of their local affairs.
and then they Â¦ make .the Pi^ldent and the
Congress, which makes the laws that gov
ern the United States. And so everything,
srf far as the welfare of our Government
Is concerned, rests upon the people.
Good citizenship is indispensable to good
government. Bad citizenship will always
induce bad government. But so long as the
American home continues to be the fountain
of purity and virtue, so long as the'Amer
ican school is supported by the American
people, we will have guod citizenship, and In
turn good government. (Applause.)
"We are proud of our army and of our
navy, and yet that Is not our chief pride.
Seeing, as I walked lu, the Grand Army of
the Republic recalled to me the days of the
great Civil War, which developed some of
the greatest captains of the age. So in our '
recent Spanish war men of great gallantry
and great valor came to the front. We love
to recall these glorious deeds of the past;
we love to recall the more recent one of
l>wey at Manila. (Great applause.) But,
my fellow-citizens, our chief pride is not in
the arts of war, but in the peaceful pursuits
of civil life, to reach its highest develop
ment. Our victories must be in the arts. In
the sciences, in manufacture and in agri
culture and learning if we would really
make a great and progressive and enduring
nation. Our nation now is marching along
these lines, thanks to the virtue and Intelli
gence of the American people. This re
public was founded 124 years ago in con
science. It Is our business to keep it In
conscience, to preserve it for those who
shall come after and to pass It along to our
successors, as a beacon light of liberty the
world over.
. Mayor Holllster then came forward and
presented to the President a prettily
decorated basket containing- some souve
nirs of the city and county of San Luis
Obispo. There was an album containing
photographs of the town and Its vicinity,
some "panahe" or Spanish sweetmeat, a
hair rope beautifully decorated and . fin
ished and several other things character
istic of the place. It was getting late and
dark, and bo the President was hurried
through the lobby of the hotel, where a
crowd of men and women struggled for
a grasp of his hand, and to the dining
room, as the people believed.
Instead he was taken to the other door
and before the people understood the rube
President McKinley was well started for
the station again. They rushed after him
pellmell down the street, distancing
Grand Marshal F. E. Doak and hia five
mounted aids and arrived in a heap at
the station In time to receive a last bow
from the President. Then he retired to
his car and the train drew away with the
air still ringing with -the last cheer. Tbe
twinkling end lights of the President's car
grew dimmer and dimmer and finally
passed out into the darkness.

BRILiJANT YOUNG CLERGY
MAN AND THE SCENE OF
HIS FUTURE LABORS.
POSTUM CEEEAL.
A "KNOCKER."
Found on. Many Tables.
People will "slug" themselves with cof-
fee and then hunt around for medicine to
cure them of the trouble coffee produces,
but they keep on drinking coffee and mak-
ing new diseases right along. That is.
Borne people do. There are thoughtful
people, however, and their number ia
growing greatly every month, who prefer
Vood, sturdy health to sickness, and they
leave off coffee because it Is a drug tfiat
produces disease.
Many people have to learn that this is
true by hard knocks, and they get the
knocks all >ght if they stick to coffee.
Mrs. Ida M. ICowyce of Anderson, S. C,
Kays: "For two years or 'more before leav-
ing off coffee and beginning the use of
Postuai Food Coffee my health became
very much impaired, as I discovered aft-
erward, from coffee drinking.
"I suffered from shortness of breath,
pains about the heart and the slightest
exercise completely exhausted me. My di-
gestion was bad and gas would form in
the stomach, rendering me wretched and
my Hfe a burden. Medicine did not help
the trouble. I was on the eve of giving up
in despair when my attention was attract-
ed to the statement that coffee caused
some of the eymptoms that I had. I de-
termined to abandon it and try Postum
Food Coffee.
."I had the Postum well made, and the
result during the past twelve months has
been something wonderful. AH of the old
troubles left. I have been In excellent
health, and my friends all notice It and
speak of it. I never lose an opportunity
of telling them that the change in my
health was caused by leaving off a drug
C8l)t-d coffee and taking on a liquid food
drink like Postum.
"No argument from any source could
convince me to the contrary of what I
have found out. I have seen much the
came resuits in rny sister's family and
wnor.c other acquaintances." â Â¦

THE Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's Coptic arrived
from China and Japan via Hono
lulu yesterday. She made the $un
from the latter por-t in the good
time of five days nineteen hours forty
seven minutes, thus getting here a day
before she was expected.
While the Coptic was at Nagasaki there
were a number of street fights between
French and English sailors. During one
of the disturbances an English sailor was
killed and a marine was so badly stabbed
that he was not expected to live.
There was in port at Nagasaki when the
Coptic left the French cruisers Bugeaud,
Guichen and Alouette and the English
battleship Barfleur. Some months ago
these vessels were at Shanghai and tne
sailors from them engaged in numerous
street fights. When they met again at
Nagasaki the quarreling was renewed. A
party of English sailors ran across some
Frenchmen from the Bugeaud and gave
them a beating. The French procured re
inforcements and, armed with swords and
knives, attacked the Britishers while they
were drinking in a Japanese saloon. Ihe
Englishmen, armed with walking-sticks,
numbered eight all told, while there were
twenty Frenchmen. During the fight
which followed an English sailor named
Henry Snell was ran through the heart
and killed, while a marine was so badly
cut that he was expected to die when the
Coptic sailed. The sailor who did the
killing was from the Bugeaud, but noth
ing had been done With him up to the bail
ing of the mail boat. The British Consul
and all the officers of the Barfleur attend
ed Snell's funeral.
The Coptic brings the news that Cap
tain Sodergren of the bark Hesper, who
was convicted of cruelty on the high seas,
got six months' imprisonment on the reef
on the first count, but was found "not
guilty" on the second.
The ship Henry Villard, now ori her way
here from Honolulu, had a hard time get
ting away from port. The crew was drunk
and after the ship had lost her jlbboom
in a collision the cantain had to take
the wheel himself. The damage was re
paired before the ship came on to the
coast.
Besides her cabin passengers the Cop
tic brings seven second cabin, six hun

were:

New Steamship for Vallejo Trade.
The new steamer General Frisbie. built
for the Vallejo trade by Hatch Bros.', will
have her trial trip in a day or two and
will go into commission in time to take
part in the launching , of the battleship
Ohio. The r.ew boat is 170 feet Ions. 26
feet beam and 14 feet deep. She is expect
ed to average eighteen knots an. hour. She
will be licensed to carry 500 passengers;
but will have accommodations for twice
that number of people. The new steamer
is named after the founder of Vallejo.
Old General Krisble is now in Mexico and
a few months ago celebrated his golden
wedding. He married a daughter of the
late General Vallejo. :
The General Frisbie will be commanded
by Captain George Wheeler of the Mon-
Ucello. ;.:.'.:
Railroad Ties From Guayaquil.
Swayne & Hoyt have chartered the
British steamer Â¦ Victoria for eight 1 round
trips to Guayaquil with railroad ties.
There was some very. close bidding for: the
contract by Puget Sound parties, but the
San Francisco house secured the plum.
The contract calls for 13,000,000 railroad
ties and it will take the Victoria eight
trips to deliver them. Returning she. will
bring niter to San Francisco. The rail
road ties will come from Noyo.
Water Front Notes.
Captain W. H. Hawes of the Samoa has
been transferred to the Egbert, while
Captain A. N. Walton of the latter vessel
takes the Samoa. The Egbert, after com
pleting' 20,000 miles of travel, docked at
Folsam-street wharf yesterday. She will
not remain long in port, as she sails
again to-day for' the gold fields via Pug-et
Sound. The Warren sails Monday for the
same ports and the Samoa leaves next
Wednesday for Portland, Seattle and Ma
nila. ~ - .
A few days ago the rate of reinsurance
on the British ship Manchester Jumped
from 65 to 90 per cent. She is now out 261
days from New York for Yokohama wilh
a cargo of coal oil. The cause of the jump
was the arrival of the German bark
Birma at Yokohama on April 18 last. The
Birma sailed from New York three months
after the Manchester.
The steamer Eureka will in future carry
mail from Humboldt County. Hitherto the
Pomona has been the only mail boat. The
addition of the Eureka will give the peo
ple of Eureka a delivery every two days.
The new four-masted schooner Kona,
built by Hay & Wright for Hind, Rolph
& Co.. will be launched at Alameda Point

TAHITI TO HOLD
GREAT FESTIVAL
Fall of the Bastile to Be
Celebrated by the
Natives.
Bea'utiful, Barbaric and Odd
Scenes Will There Be
Witnessed.
There will be an exodus of tourists and
plessure-seekers to Taniti next month.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's mag
nificent mail boat Australia leaves for the
islands on June SO and will be at Papeete
in plenty of time for the grand celebration
of the fall of the Bastile, The native cere
monies on this historic occasion are worth
a journey around the world to see.
It is not that the native Tahitian knows
much about the Bastile or the causes that
led to its fall, but that his islands have
long been under the sway of France and
Le is therefore obliged to look to his su
periors for permission to let himself loose
when he feels in the humor to do so. The
natives are ruled In a strict but kindly
manner. They are treated like children,
who must be amused if .they are to be
kept out of mischief. Hence when the
period of governmental rejoicing comes
round special license is extended and the
Tahitians have full rein to do aa they
please. And they do It.
Barbarous Customs in Full Sway.
They forget all conventionality, indulge
in their own sports, their own supersti
tious ceremonies, their own convivialities,
their own life in general as nearly in its
ante-civilized form as possible. For three
dajfc, from the 13th to the 15th of July,
Papeete, the capital city of the islands, is
tilled with throngs of dark-skinned na
tives not only from the Tahitian Islands
themselves but from neighboring groups
WW mi!es away.
The festival opens with a grand native
procession from the beach through the
streets of the town to the Governors pal
ace. The colonial army of perhaps two
cr three hundred soldiers and gendarmes
marches past in review order and the en
circling group of natives cheers and
fchouts itself hoarse at this brave display.
'then the real Tahitian interest develops,
and first and foremost to the student of
native life comes the massed choir con
tests. Each choir generally contains
about fifty men and women. There is no
orchestra, not even an organ, and each
choir sings its carefully rehearsed
"hymenes," guided only by the waving
hand of the leader. The time is perfect
ajui the effect produced by fifty powerful,
well trained voices chanting in unison
such i<. hymn as "L/Eternal est Createur"
is musical.
Another equally interesting feature is
the native dance, given by special permis
sion of the Government, in the old Tahi
tian costume, such as was worn in Cap
tain Cooks days. Ordinarily this Hress,
or lack of dress, is not permitted, and this
is the only opportunity the visitor has of
resizing how this once savage race ap
peared to our forefathers. The men wear
only their grass girdles, profusely decor
ated with shells, the women, are content
with a pareua or girdle, likewise made of
gra^s, and covered with brightly stained
strips of pandanus fiber. But to make up
fcr this scarcity of attire they are all
profusely tit rated with leas, or wreaths
of Fweet-smc-.lir.g flowers. The dance,
siren to a monotonous chant, is weirdly
'larbaric in its effect, now warlike in its
note, now verging on the sensuous.
"Walk on Hot Stones.
The Tahitian entertainment winds up
with tha marvelous fire-walking feat,
vrhich science has never explained. Na
tives of all -classes walk baxefooted across
S wide Pit of redhot stones without being
hurt. Even Europeans have essayed this
ordeal and come out unscathed, yet none
can exwlain how it is done.
While the celebration occurs every year,
it ir given full swing only once in every
two years. The last big observance took
p!ace in 1899! The regular one. therefore,
Is due in July of this year. Meanwhile,
however, the Oceanic Steamship Company
has been engaged by the French Govern
ment to establish a line of steamers from
San Francisco connecting the islands with
thf t'nited States, and the general popu
lsce of the islands realize that their land
is now brought fully within the realms of
civilization. Increased tourist travel is
anticipated, and, therefore, the natives
pror>cFP to have an unusually prand blow
out. "The French colonial officers sym
pathize with them and agree to give them
a free hand. The result may be expected
to be memorable in the history of the
South Sea Island races.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL. BUREAU. 1406 G- 'STREET. N.
W. t WASHINGTON, May. 10.âRepresent
atives of Chilean and Argentine legations
here are not able to confirm the report
that the Straits of Magellan are being for
tified by the Chilean Government contrary
to. the treaty agreement between the two
nations concerned. While at the ' Chilean
legation it is said that no official informa
tion has been received there- which would
Indicate that any such step i3 in contem
plation and there is a disposition to dis
credit the report, a similar statement is
given at the Argentine legation, although
it is admitted that no official information
on the subject has been received there.
It is understood, however, that an agree
ment exists between Argentine and Chile
by which they bind themselves to allow
the Straits of Magellan to remain neutral.
This agreement was entered into many
years ago- when the countries succeeded
in averting a war by providing for a di
vision between them of Terra del Fuego,
which comprises all that part of the con
tinent of South America below the Straits
of Magellan. At the same time they
pledged themselves to refrain from fortify
ing the Straits and in face of that agree
ment Chile would hardly break faith ex
cept under extraordinary circumstances.
In the absence of dny information on
the subject there is an inclination in dip
lomatic circles generally to believe that
Chile anticipates trouble with two or
three South American nations which may
follow the failure of negotiations with
Peru and Bolivia to settle the'Tacna and'
Arlca auestions, Reports have been in
circulation for some time past to the ef
fect that Chile is preparing herself for
an Inevitable conflict with some ' of her
neighbors. Therefore the announcement
that active defense operations are now in
progress by the Chilean Government is
regarded as probable by other representa
tives of the South American colony.
At the State Department no confirma
tion of the report is to be obtained. The
American . Consul at Punta Arenas is
Martz Broun. He is stationed at what Is
commonly called a half-way point In tlie
Straits of Magellan. In his last report
to the department he made no mention of
the subject of fortifications and, being
familiar with the situation, he is expect
ed to keep this Government advised of
any radical movement by either Chile or
Argentine. ;
. The agreement existing between Chile
and Argentine is similar in intention tp
that which exists between the United
States and Canada prohibiting an in
crease of force of warships on the great
lakes. . .

The Sempervirens Club held a meeting
last evening at the Palace Hotel. Charles
Wesley Reed presided, and after calling
the meeting to order explained that a
plan of campaign must at once be formed
and the good work continued to save the
redwood forests In tho Big Basin district,
In tho Santa Cruz Mountains. He ex
plained that ex-Lieutenant Governor Jeter
held the bond on 2200 acres of redwoeds
that tho ciub had selected for its first pur
chase with the money that had been ap
propriated by tho last Legislature. Reed
then appointed u oommlttee.-eomposed of

Baron D. 1 von Bergen, secretary of the
German Legation at Peking, arrived here
yesterday from the Orient. He is on his
way to Berlin to receive instructions be
fore leaving for Rome, where he has been
appointed secretary of the legation.
Baron vo^Bergen says that the war in
China has resulted in cementing the
friendship between this country and Ger
many. ' ' Â¦ â¢ .. â¢
"During the siege," said he," "the Ameri
can Legation was in bad . straits. The
building! was. surrounded with howling
mobs of Chinese and the Americans wera
very, short of soldiers. We assisted them
with Â¦ our men whenever we could. We
used to send over, a detail of. ten men
when practical. This may. seem a. small
number to you, but I can tell you that ten
armed white men form, a small army in
the eyes of the Chinese. " ,

be settled soon and that everybody dam
aged by the war -will- be . reimbursed. I
am. on my way back - to Germany, and
from there I go to Rome, where I shall be

' YOKOHAMA, April 24.â Since the back
dcwii of Russia, by which she has lost
immensely in her prestige in the- Orient,
matters have I resumed their normal
course, though Japan's' distrust of the
northern power still remains I in as full
force as ever, and tho nation does not in
the least relax its vigilance in watching
every move of the Muscovite.
The- latter, temporarily foiled, in the
Chinese. game, is now engaged in machi
nations in Korea, using France as the in
strument of his designs, and the Japan
ese do not fall to detect the significance
of .what is called the French loan to the
Korean Government, St being merely a
strengthening of Russia's influence in
the peninsula.'
This system of encroachment, Judging
from the temper of the native press here,
will not long be borne by Japan and some
day in . tho not distant future war will
come like a bolt from - the blue. None
save those who have long resided in Japan
can form any conception of the strength
of the national sentiment regarding Ko
rea. The people here have been taught
for centuries that the destinies of the two
countries are indissolubly united and the
conviction of this Is not only Ineradicable
but has become part' and parcel of the
patriotic enthusiasm which Is the nation's
life. '
Moreover, the tide of emigration has
flowed In largo volume to tho peninsula,
which is recognized as the only field In
view. of the growing restrictions upon the
Influx of Asiatics In the West. Japan has
now a population of 45.000,000 upon a sur
face less than that of the Atlantic States
of America, and, it being a mass of moun
tains; only one-twelfth, of the soil is
arable. Korea, therefore, becomes an ab
solute necessity In the near future as a
field for emigration, apart from the fact
that its > possession by Russia would be
recognized as a t mortal menace to the
Island Empire. It may ; therefore be im
agined that this nation's patience is liable
at any moment to, be exhausted by Rus
sia's diplomatic policy. -

The Twenty-ninth Infantry, a regiment
possessing a fine record, was mustered out
of the service of Uncle Sam yesterday af
ternoon at the Presidio, and the ex-boys
In blue made the welkin ring with their
cheers as they were handed their finals.
Th pay corps attached to the Depart
ment of California, as well as the forces
of clerks connected with the mustering
out office at the Presidio, have reduced
the work of mustering out the regiments
to a science. Within six hours a regiment
that required weeks to organize is dis
missed from the service, and to do this
requires the payment or thousands of dol
lars to impatient soldiers, and the hand
ling of muster rolls containing the names
of several hundred men.
The' men of the Twenty-ninth were a
saving lot, many of them receiving $500 as
final payment. Th--Â»y*Â£iffered in no way
from the soldiers discharged beforethem.
As soon as they were paid off they pro
ceeded to purchase of photographers and
dealers, in trinkets al! sorts of souvenirs.
Rumors were rife concerning the pres
ence in the camp of a number of civilians
dressed in soldiers' clothes who were mak
ing every effort to separate the men from
their hard-earned cash. Several of them
were detected and thrown out pt the camp
with scant ceremony and considerable
force. Stories of soldiers found on the
hillsides drugged and robbed were told,
but could not be traced to any reliable
sources. â¢
Colonel E. ! E. Hardin was presented'
with* a beautiful gold and silver loving
cup last night by the officers of the Twen

HE DII> NOT ABSTRACT
THE PROMISSOBY NOTE
Saloon-Keeper Cleared of Serious Al-
legation Made in Justices' Court
Complaint.
Justice of the Peace Daniels gave a
Judgment yesterday in favor of Henry
Collins, the well-known saloon-keeper,
who was sued by Martin Floegel for J^oO
balance duo on a promissory note. Floe
gel alleged in his complaint that Collins
had signed tho note, which was thereupon
deposited in a safe in Otto Norman's cafe
on Bush street, Jn which Collins was a
part owner. Floegel accused Collins of
having abstracted tho note from tne safe,
but Judge Daniels ruled that there was
no evidence to bear out the charge. 4
The most Interesting testimony was that
given bv Otto Norman, who tells of how
Collins became his partner, in the con
cern. An advertisement was inserted in
the papers stating that a* cashier was
wanted for tho saloon. I Floegel responded
and was given tho place at $30 per month,
after puttinjr up $450 In cash as an in
demnity bond, for .which Collins gave him
his personal note. . Tho money was used
as partnership funds by the firm, which
paid Floe0cl bac,k â¢ $300 .of tho money,
charging the payment to Collins* account.
A new note was drawn, but Norman could
not swear that it was inclosed in the
bankbook. which Floegel was accustomed
to deposit in the safe. â¢Â¦

FROM INFANTRY
TO ARTILLERY
The elopement of Mrs. Nellie Heilig.
v.ife of the Postmaster at New Braunfels,
Tex., with J. B. Pratt, a school teacher.
has come to an unromantic encl. They
were arrested here last Saturday night by
Dctective Whittakcr while leaving the
Langham Hotel. They had made arrange
ments to leave for Australia by the steam
er Sierra, which sailed last Thursday.
Yesterday Attorney August Aitgelt. who
had been sworn in as a deputy sheriff, ar
rived here from Texas and called upon
Captain Seymour. He afterward had a
conversation with the eloping couple at
the City Prison. He was satisfied that
Pratt would be shot if he was taken back
to Texas, and sueffested that if the couple
would pay the J1000 belonging to the wom
en's husband which they took away with
them they could go about their business.
Heilig has instituted a suit for divorce
against his wife and Alteelt, and she
would be required to sign the citation for
her appearnoe. She would in addition be
required to renounce all claim to her four
children, the oldest being 6 years and the
youngest a baby 10 months old.
The couple readily agreed to the condi
tions, and Pratt gave Altgelt an order
through the British Consul for Â£100 to be
collected .from an estate in Kngland to
which he is heir but in which his mother
has a life interest. The money found
upon Pratt when arrested, amounting to
J5M, was also handed over to Altgelt.
When Captain Seymour learned of the
arrangements! he gave orders that the
prisoners be discharged from custody and
turned over to Attorney Altgelt. Sey
mour refused 10 be a party to the com
pounding of a felony, Pratt and Mrs.
Heilig having been charged with grand
larceny for stealing the money. All the
documents wore signed and Pratt and
Mrs. Heilig loft the prison, a friend of
Mrs. Hrllig Hc~ompanying them. Altgelt
expr^sst-d the opinion that Pratt would
soon desert the woman and leave her to
her own resources. Altgelt gave her 110
and Pratt 15, m that she would havo
something to etart life with. There was a
reward efforod of t^Kt for their capture,

| The Most Important Period in a
Â§ Woman's Existence.â Mrs. John-
son Tells How She Was Helped
Over the Trying Time.
. Â» .
* Owing 1 to modern methods of living 1 , not one woman in a thousand ap-
proaches this perfectly natural change without experiencing a train of very
annoying,* and sometimes painful symptoms.
Those dreadful hot flashes, sending the blood surging to the heart until it
seems ready to burst, and the faint feeling that follows, sometimes with chills,
as if the heart' were going to stop for good, are only a few of the symptoms of
a dangerous nervous trouble. The nerves are crying but for assistance. The
cry should bo heeded in time. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound was
prepared to meet the needn of woman's system at this trying period of her life.
The three following letters are guaranteed to be genuine and true, and
still further provo what a great medicine Lydia E. Pinkham'* Vegetable
Compound Is (or women.
Mar. 13, 1807.
" Dear Mns. Piniuiam :â I have been sick for a long time. I was taken
sick with flooding. All my trouble seemed to be in tho womb. I ache all tho
timo at the lower part of tho womb. Tho doctor eays tho womb is covered
with ulcers. I suffer with a pain on the left side of my back over the kidney.
I am fifty years old and passing through the change of life. Please advlte me
what to do to get relief. Would llko to hear from you as soon as possible. 1 *â

11 1 havo been taking your remedies, and think they have helped me a great
deal, I had- been in bed for ten weeks when I began taking your .Vegetablo
Compound, but aftor uiing it for a short timo I wad able to do up around the
houfle. The aching in the lower part of womb has lef b me. .Tne most that
troubles me sow is the flowing. -That is not so bad, but still thoro Is a little
â¢very duy, I am not discouraged yot, and Ahull continue with your medicine,
(or I believe it will euro me."â Ainu. Cuarlotte Johnson, Monclova.Ohlo.
April 13, 1000.
" I send you this letter *,o publish for the benefit of others. I was sick for
about nlno years so that I could not do my work. For thrco months I could
not sit up long enough to huvo my bed mado. I had live different doctors, and
all said there wan no help for me. My trouble was change of life. I suffered
with ulceration ot tho womb, pain in sides, kidney and stomach trouble, back*
ache, headacho, and dizziness. â¢ I am well and strong, and feel llko a new
person. Mv recovery is a perfect surprlso to everybody that knew me. I owe
all to Lydia 10. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. I would not do without
your medicine for anything. There is no need of women suffering so much if
they would take your remedies, for they are a sure cure." â Mrs. Chablottk
Johnson, Monclova, Ohio.
When one stops to think about the good Mrs. Johnson derived from Mrs.
Pinkham's advice and medicine, it seems almost beyond belief; yet it is all
true as stated in her three letters published above at her own request.
As a matter of positive fact. Mrs. Pinkham has on file thousands of
letters from women who have been safely carried through that danger period
"Change of Life." Mrs. Johnson's cure is not an unusual one for Mrs. Pink-
ham's medicine to accomplish. â¢

in price*. That is to say, the fact of the re-
Ivyund was very natural after the exc:ting
times yesterday, but the rtiige of the recovery
*i.s surprising. Large progress was made
to'vjird wiping cat the net losses which re
mained last r.is:ht after the recovery had al
ready set in on the exchange. In a numUr of
stocks which were not acutely affected yester
day to-Uay's price rose above Wednesday's
< losing level and 4n Missouri Pacific yester
ilcy't; net Ioes was recovered with 3 points to
tsj-art.-, the extreme advance reach-Ing 15 points.
ThPi-e was a good deal of trepidation still evi
d< v.l this njornlng, owing to th: vague dread
thut there might be exchange huuses which
w.,iild h" unable to meet their obligations after
v^-et^rday's â¢irattic t-xperiem-e. The market
KM, therefore, unsettled and feverish, even
alter the ftiong opening, but when the effl
<ial announcement was made that the clearing
sh-*-ts or all the members of the Stock-Ex
< haiifie had gone through the Stock Exchange
<|paring-hour-e perfectly and that all their
< lift ks had been honored a feeling of relief
v as manifested and steadily grew throughout
"no day. During the latter part of thÂ» day
ihrr.-- was a resumption of what looked like a
speculative raovcir.enl for the rise led by
â¢ nfon Pacific. The buoyancy of this stock and
the acccn-.pan\ ing strength of the Southwest-
ems was bastd upon rumors and assumptions
â¢ â¢!' the benefits to accrue to L'nlon Pacific from
a change in control of Northern Pacific, which
was fctiil stoutly claimed by the Union Pacific
j.srty. Undoubtedly there were very many
Speculative losers of treat resources in the
collapse of Thursday who retained their nerve
and deteimlnation and who set about 1 to re
coup themselves by new speculation on the
market. Other buyers were those who had
Â£<.Uen out early in yesterday's clump and
Â¦who still saw a profit in getting back at the
lrticcK nilins to-<lay. The bargain hunters
wen bIro on hand in considerable force and
tlwe were many cash transactions, both in
bonds and stocks representing the purchases.
This outcome of affairs was pretty well ap-
Furtd when the news was learned this mcrn
ing of the settlement effected with the shorts
in Nortl<--rn TaciHc on the basis of $150 per
share. This renvned the overshadowing fear
from tlie market and the quotations for North
ern Pacific on the tape at 1S0 still further al
layed the apprehension. The stock sold at 209
for cash afterward, but thn progress it the
sett'.ement with the shorts at the offices or the
conflicting interests in Norhern Pacific pre
ferred rrevented any further disturbance en
that ground. The measures taken . by the
baajn, which placed heavy loans in thÂ« mar
ket yesterday and their decision not to call
the loans to-day, completed . the tranquili'Ing
influence s. The Â¦ market closed strong at th*

NEW YORK, May 10.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say:- Â¦â¢ -.
1 Speculation on an - unparalleled scale has at
last resulted in a decline in prices of great
severity, attended by sensational developments,
although the market recovered sharply on Fri
day. . ; The corner in Northern Pacific stock and
the contest for the control : of that | property
between the Union Pacific interests, represented
by Kuhn, L&eb & Co., and- the Morgan-Hill
party was unexpected and unforeseen.' In fact,
up to last Tuesday the street was more im
pressed" by the idea that there "was an effort
on foot to obtain control of the Union Pacific
for the Vanderbilt interest and the Northwest
ern and St. Paul .systems than by the real dan
ger with' which it was confronted.- The enor
mous trading In Union Pacific shares gave point
to . this theory, but on last Monday, when the
dealings In Northern Pacific common stock rose
to nearly 400,000 shares for the day and the buy
ing assumed a concentrated -form, the presence
of some unusual factors was recognized. Even
this, with the rise of the stock to 133, â¢ was at
first deemed to be a matter Â¦ of secondary im
portance; but when Northern Pacific stock be
came scarce in' the loan crowd and the rate
for the borrowing of it was quoted flat or with
out, interest and finally at a premium, as was
the case. on Tuesday, it was then understood
that a collision between great railroad and
banking interests had taken place. Â¦ The full
significance of the situation was seen when
Northern Pacific common soared to over 149 on
Tuesday and the rate at which it could be bor
rowed overnight was as hlsh as 10 per cent
from the par value, i On Wednesday the street
was In practical possession of. the fact that
the Union Pacifla Interests objected to the Bur
lington deal effected by the Morgan-Hill allies
in behalf of Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific and had requested that it be admitted to
a- one-third Interest in the transaction, and,
being refused, had proceeded to acquire the
Northern Pacific stocks to an amount sufficient
to control- the. voting power, of that company
and thus dictate- terms to the combination. On
Wednesday . there was a further advance of
Northern. Pacific to 150 and -the stock, loaned
for use as high. as 50 per. cent, and the logical
conclusion was that the Morgan-Hill ' people
were also acquiring stock; that the possession
of a control Â¦ by either - was still a matter of
doubt and that the consummation of the Bur
lington purchase by-' the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific In the "form originally pro
posed might be defeated. The short Interest in'
the stock was also manifestly large . and .was
due partly to the temptation to bears to sell
the stock at Its extreme advance and partly to
the marketing of stock by foreign arbitrageurs
against purchases made In London, from which
city certificates cannot reach New York under
ten days' time. The representatives of the
rival parties naturally expressed a readiness to
make the matter easy for arbitrage houses by
lending shares flat or on reasonable terms, .but
It was otherwise with the rank and file of the
shorts, among whom the street believed some
large speculative Interests were included. -
Dangerous as the situation In -Northern Pa
cific was It became positively demoralizing to
the market on Thursday, when hopes of a set
tlement of the! complication did not bear fruit
and the price of Northern Pacific common, un
der urgent buying by bears called on Â¦ to re
turn borrowed stock, forced the price to $300
per share, then to $700 and finally to as high
as $1000. Violent variations In Â¦ the price en
sued, though assurance was 'given by the peo
ple -who had accumulated the stock that shorts
would be treated with consideration, and after
the close on Thursday' it was stated an agree
ment had been reached by which all parties
could settle their shorts at 150.' ..

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
is not appreciably afferted. As is the case.'
with all booms, the collapse was caused by
an accident. This was the corner in Northern
Pacific, which has emerged from Its mysteries
and stands disclosed to public view in â¢ its
principal facts and " bearings. It. is the nature
or a speculative boom and it contains within
itself no corrective force, but rather the mate
rial for its own growth and excess. Buying
for a rise in Itself Induces that rise and fur
nishes the profits for renewed buying and re
newed advance until the world joins/ the
gathering horde of speculators to ehare in the
sudden fortunes and all available credits are
drawn on to secure holdings of stdfcks. None
of there holdings are to keep and the onlv In
centive to buying is the hope of further'rise.
\\ hen any accident happens to endanger the
continuance of the rise the demand therefor
ceases absolutely. When holders attempt to
seil, first to take prontg, ! then to save losses,
there are no buyers. Prices decline and the
credits on which holders depend shrinit and
they must sell. The shrinkage of the value of
securities endangers the safety of loans for
which they serve as collateral and bankers
must be repaid. Money must be had on any
terms to avert ruin, stocks are sold without
regard to prices and 'a species of panic en
sues. That is what happened- this week on the
Stock Exchange. The remarkable feature of
the collapse of fictitious values Is that it was
precipitated by the very operations upon which
the boom was largely based. These were the
plans working out for consolidations of rail
road, systems which stimulated dreams of in
definite increase in values of railroad securi
ties and furnished the great Incentive to the
vast speculative buying. One railroad stock
after another has risen in price by wonderful
leaps and; bounds, under the influence either
of actual negotiations for absorption and con
solidation or of rumors pf such negotiations.
No later than last week Union Pacific was
rushed up to $133 per share on the belief that
it was to be absorbed to form a link in a
transcontinental railroad system. The similar
movements which had previously occurred in
Northern Pacific. Burlington and St. Paul gave
the speculators the utmost confidence in fol
lowing the movement which marked . another
of the comprehensive advances In the general
level of prices for railroad stocks whlcu was
building up fortunes for the lucky ones who
had bought the shares. The development of a
similar movement In Northern Pacific was
hailed with jubilation as another step in the
boom. On Monday when Northern Pacific was
lifted to 153. the whole list responded with an
advance and the buyers of stocks were crowd
ing to the stock exchange to buy stocks again.
A single broker bought 200,000 shares of North
ern Pacific that day and continued to buy the
next day. This particu'ar buying has bwn
variously attributed to one of the contending
parties fcr the control of Northern Pacific
and to a speculator who intentionally sought
to corner the stock and squeeze the shorts.
In any event the stock was cornered and the
shorts i were thrown into alarm and their un
availing efforts to find resources to meet their
obligations served as the shock which toppled
over the airy fabric of stock market prices,
reared on insufficient credit, which therefore
came crashing .Mown. On Wednesday nlsht
shorts paid as high as $S5C0 for the privilege
of borrowing 100 shares of Northern Pacific
common for deliver/- next day. On Thursday
the stock sold on the exchange for $1000 'per
share and the shorts began throwing- over the
holdings of other stocks on the weak market
to realize money and threw the market Into
p spasm of unprecedented violence. The dis
closure growing out of the Northern Pacific
episode that bitter and apparently irreparable
animosities had grown up among contending
groups of the country's largest capitalists
shattered confidence in all the supposed meas
ues to secure community of Interest and the
abolition of costly competition among rail
roatls. It seems Incredible that with an out
standing share capital of SOO.OCO shares the
shorts could not borrow or buy shares for
delivery at any price and It marks the des
peration of the struggle for control of Â¦ the
property, that neither party, should , consent to
lend of their abundant supply of stocks even
to relieve the panic which wasi damaging vast
projects of their own as well as bringing ruin
and disaster to others for fear that- the stock,
once out of their hands, would be used to
defeat their claims to control. The collapse
also revealed the purely speculative character
of the greater part of the recent- large buying
whioh has been readily attributed by the
heated imagination of speculators to buy-
Ins for investment and control by the great
railroad systems, to be taken out of the
market and placed in strong boxes and thj
vaults of trust companies. The completeness
of the collapse â¢ seems to have thoroughly
cleared the market of the recklessly specuTa
tive holders and the market quickly renlized
that the low prices to which stocks fell in -the
demoralization of Thursday were as unreal and
as far from representing their true values
as were the Inflated prices Jto which the boom
Â¦had carried them. The bargain hunter ap
peared in Wall street with the funds which
he never hazards in specuatlve booms and
showed his willingness to pay prices for stock*
far above those touched in the panic and
which would mean Insolvency for many com
mission houses. .The measures taken by .the
banks to supply the needed money and the.
settlement with the Northern Pacific shorts
quieted, the acute fears of holders of stocks
and a greater . degree of confidence began
quickly to be re-established. But' it is not
assumed that the necessary adjustments of
damages resulting from Thursday's shock are
to be completed In a day.
Bonds shared in the demoralization of stocks,
but to a'niuch less extent. Apparently a part
of the selling of bonds was for the purpose of
procuring funds to buy stocks at the low
levels. -

NEW YORK, May 10.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
No business to speak of waa done anywhere
on this side to-day. London is awaiting the
settlement which will be begun on Monday.
The tone was dull. Mining cbntangoes were
heavy; money is being held ' back ' for thei ar
rangement of American accounts, and miners
are being sold freely to make up the differ
ences in Americans. Â¦ Â¦' * -. : ... <
In the best informed quarters here they 'say
that the talk of failures and losses ! here ': are
grossly exaggerated. The panic is looked upon
simply as a case of heavy profits diminished
and the expectation is that those with good
credit can easily be tided over. One prominent
jobber's account was , closed by - arrangement.
The market for Americans was singularly
devoid of excitement. Business was very idle
and prices were wide. Almost all dealings' are
a matter of negotiation. â¢ â¢ . .
CLOSING
The start in Americans was good. The first
prices were from two to twelve above I the
close in New York last night, and Â¦' Chicago
Milwaukee and St. Paul took the lead for a
rise with a spurt of 21 points. New. York had
cabled general buying orders over night. There
was a slight depression after the closing of
the account mentioned . above, Atchisons es
pecially going oft four points from the high.
In the afternoon session the market was stag
nant and in the street after the , close prices
hardened with Northern Â¦ Pacific leading, in the
expectation of the little squeeze in the latter*
this because all the available supply of certifi
cates had been, shipped. Six dollars premium
is being paid already by the bears on advance
Money was -steady.

â¢try has been In any way interfered with by the
âfor the time - involvedâ severest fall in prices
in .the history oÂ£ the t New York Â¦ Stock Ex
change. I A very general conclusion reached Is
that, Indeed, the convulsion is purely a "stock
panic," not involving or connected with ' the
general industries of the country in any way.
There will not. in fact, be a bushel of wheat
or a ton of coal less in the country as a result
of this convulsion. Speculation In grain and
other staples, has, however, : been checked by
the ' concentration of interest upon the stock
market. Â¦ â¢ â¢ 4 Â¦ .- Â¦ ..-;
General trade advices this week are - in the
main rather more favorable than those of last
week, mainly because of the lmprovwnent-'ln
crop prospects, due to seasonable rains follow
ing planting. The lull in the active buying
demand for iron and steel noted last .weeK Is
even more pronounced to-day, : but this is
mainly because mills and furnaces are already
heavily sold ahead and large consumers, hav
ing placed orders, are now awaiting delivery.
Bank clearings, swelled by enormous- stock
operations, break all records. Gross railway
earnings continue to show satisfactory* increase,
and -failures are down to a normal minimum.
The textiles are still the soft spot in the general
situation, and are dull. â¢_Â¦>â¢ Â¦
The feature of the week in the crop situation
Is the arrival of rains throughout the North
west which has placed the spring wheat crop',
now nearly all planted, in excellent, condition.
In the Southwest and Central West crop re
ports are generally good. Weather conditions
on the Pacific Coast are more- favorable for
crops and a good yield of grain is indicated.
Wool is slow on sale, but there is some more
movement In new wools at the interior. Large
manufacturers are practically out of the mar
ket. . , Â¦. . Â¦Â¦Â¦ . - . . " : Â¦
New business is more notable In Iron and steel
than for some time, but prices are steady and
firm at last week's quotations. With mills and
furnaces running to : their full capacity, â¢ the
pigiron output on the first of tho month is said
to be the largest In the country's history, ex
ceeding the boom of February, 1900.: New. busi
ness Is small in rails, but inquiries are numer

Condition of - Winter Wheat.
WASHINGTON, Mays 10.â Returns / to the
statistician, of ,the Department of 'Agriculture
made up^to May 1 show the area under winter
Â¦wheat in cultivation on that date to tfave been
about . 28,267,000 acres. This is . 2,015,Q0O \ acres,
or 6.7 -per cent less, than the area sown last
fall, but 2,032,000 acres or 7.7 per cent in ex
cess of the winter wheat acreage harvested last
year. Â¦ Of . the reduction about, one-half is- re
ported from Texas and California; due in the
former State to the ravages of the wheat plant
louse and . In the latter to the cutting,' as is
not unusual -in that-. State, of ; ; a considerable
acreage for .forage. Â»,ln the - States that had
1,000,000 acres . or upward sown: last fall the
following percentages . nre reported as aban
doned or cut i fcr forage: -Missouri 1, Kansas 1,
Illinois 1.9, Pennsylvania 2, Indiana, 2.5, Ohio
3.2, Tennessee 4.2, Michigan 9.6, Oklahoma 12.5,
California 18 and Texas 42.4.
For the area remaining: under cultivation the
average condition on May 1 was 94.1. While
this average Is 10.5 points above the mean of
the May averages of the last ten years and
has been exceeded only three times in seven
teen years, it must: be remembered that the
acreage plowed up, -cut for forage or. otherwise
abandoned has been entirely eliminated/ Â¦ In
Kansas the wheat crop has held its own at the
high average, 105, reported April 1, while an
Improvement is reported of 6 points in Penn
sylvania, . Ohio and Indiana, 8 in Illinois and 4
in Missouri. On the other hand, notwith
standing the elimination In Texas and Califor
nia .of so. much of the acreage as will not be
harvested, a decline is noted amounting to 4
points in the former State and 14 in the latter.'
The average, condition of winter rye on May
1 was 94. 6, as compared with 93.1 on April 1,
1901, 88.5 on May 1, 1900, 85.2 at the correspond
ing date In 1899 and 89.2, the mean of the May
averages of the last ten years.. The present
condition is the highest since 1S31.
Of the total amount of spring plowing re-'
ported as contemplated, It is estimated that
only 66.3 per cent was actually done up to May
1, the. proportion usually done by that date
being about 75 per cent of the whole.
A report giving the estimated acreage plant
ed in cotton,- with the condition according to
tbe latest advices, will be issued on May 31.

Fertilizing Works a Nuisance.
The Board of Health held a special
meeting yesterday for the purpose of
hearing the protest of Charles Alpers
against the recommendation made to the
Supervisors that his fertilizing works In
South San Francisco be condemned as a
public nuisance. Alpers claimed that the
offensive odors came from offal from
Butchertown which was deposited in front
of his place by the tide. Dr. Buckley said
he had made a personal investigation of
the works and the stench was unbearable.
Health Officer O'Brien said the only way
to abate the nuisance was to burn, the
building. The board decided to allow its
recommendation to stand, unless Alpers
makes such changes as will abate the
paZnnct.
The local Board of Health yesterday re
ceived a bill of $226 25 incurred, by . the
State Board of Health in clearing off the
lot- on Pacific street, near Dupont. The
work was done by Contractor- James H~
O'Brien, who employed- from three to
nine teams for six days to remove the
refuse on the let. The local board will
repudiate the bill on the ground that no
agreement was ; ever made to have the
work done.
Will Not Pay the Bill.

Early in March Mr.- Watkins returned,
accompanied by a friend. About the mid
dle of the, month Mrs. Watkins filed a
suit for divorce, alleging failure to pro~
vide. The suit came on for trial almost
Immediately. Mr, Watkins was In town,
but did not put In an appearance in court.
The whole proceeding did. not occupy ten
minutes. A settlement of property inter
ests was made out of court. The terms
were not made public except In so far as
they affected the little daughter. The
court appointed her father guardian and
her mother deeded her a considerable
piece of land. It is evident that the ar
rangements for a legal separation were
amicable and were agreed upon before the
papers in the suit were filed. During all
these proceedings the two were almost
constantly together and nobody not in
the secret would have suspected that: the
relations between them were strained.
As soon as the divorce was granted Mr.
Watkins quietly took his departure for
North Carolina without offering a word
of explanation. Less than | two months
thereafter came the sequel to this domes*
tic drama in the marriage at Reno.
Last January the young husband sudÂ«
denly announced his intention of return
ing to North Carolina. This announce
ment marked the beginning of rumors to
the effect that domestic Infelicity had in
vaded the Watkins home. The fact that
Mrs. Watkins accompanied him a part of
the way on the Journey and that their re
lations appeared to be as cordial and con
fidential as ever apparently gave the He
to these rumors.
These two young people were sweet
hearts In their school days. The mother
of the bride, Mrs. E. C. Laugenour, took
her to North Carolina to prevent a union
to which she objected. While in North
Carolina Miss Laugenour met ; a young
man named W. H. Watklns. After a short
courtship they were married and returned
to California. So far as the outside world
could observe they lived happily together
for two years and a half. During that
time a daughter was born to them, and
if they entertained an opinion that mar
riage was to them a failure they discreet
ly kept all evidence of it from the public.

English" King, whoso latest public performance
was to* stigmatize on his solemn oath the
whole Catholic world as superstitious idolators,
"knelt tbe Knglish-born Cardinal Prince of the
Church: with a document that might/ have
been presented to a Ijegree in a Southern plan
tation fifty years ago, but not by -Uncle Tom,
poor but contented, of Harriet Beecher Stowe's
great story, who -would have- seen his :blacki
skin stl-lpped oft Inch by inch, rather than put I
his mark to a document like that 'signed and
presented by Cardinal Vaughan and the Duke
of Norfolk en his solemn oath.
We I do not believe he attached the
slightest solemnity to the performance. But
the fact remains â this old ' and worn out de
scendant of a race of scoundrels and practical
professors of hideous immorality asseverated
thafnwst of the sacred doctrines of the Cath
olic faith were idolatrous and - superstitious.
He has not yet recanted. He has not said a
word to Indicate that Â¦ he did not thoroughly
approve or the terms of the oath framed in
the days of Tltup. The oath of a perjurer is
no less* vile than that of the reigning King;
but oni bended knees the Prince of the Church
knelt before this unutterably abominable per
son. I-iet us console ourselves with the fact
that t{ie presentees .were English ( Catholics.

D enunciation in Parliament.
LONDON, May 10.â At the conclusion of
the session of the House of Commons to
day John Dillon (Nationalist) -moved the
adjournment of the House in order to call
attention to the seizure of The Irish Peo
ple \Dillon complained that the action
of the authorities was grossly Illegal and
aakecT whether it was due to the attack
on Wyndham. the Chief Secretary for Ire
land, (or to the attack on the King. Wynd
ham replied that it was owing to the at
tack ,on the King.
Continuing Dillon said he was- not con
cerned to defend the violence of the at
tack, t but any seizure- should have been
done, through the courts. Far more vio
lent attacks on Queen Victoria had been
made in the English papers without their
being, seized. The present action was Â¦. a
blow < at the liberty of the press.
William Redmond (Nationalist) charac
terized the article complained of as a very
proper and patriotic attack on -the con
duct of the Chief Secretary. jWyndham.
In defending the seizure." deellnetHiO" "poll
his li-ps with reading the attack on- the
King; which . constituted seditious libel,
nor would he wound the feelings of mil
lions by propagating the outrageous, gross
and scurrlllous lies of the article."
The motion for an adjournment was de
feated by a vote of 252 to 64.
. The morning papers are unanimous in
denouncing- the scandalo"" attackof "The
Irish' People" upon the King, but serious
aoubts arÂ« raised. as to tne Wisdom of
Wyndham's action in seizing the paper,
first.; because- the .seizure was illegal, it
being; a case for prosecution; and second,
because to the delight' of the Irish mem
bers it has given world-wide publicity to
O'Bri'en's hitherto little known paper and
will, "the Nationalists claim, be: worth
thousands of dollars to them - from
American sympathizers. Many friends of
the Government consider it would have
been; better had Wyndham . ignored the
matter. â¢ . '
It appears that O'Brien was lying ill at
Mallow and was not responsible for the
objectionable, issue. It is understood that
the Government has no intention to pros
ecute the paper.

An appeal was filed yesterday in the
United States District Court by Lyman I.
Mov.-ry against the judgment of deporta
tion pronounced by United States Court
Commissioner Heacock upon Fongr Muey
Yuk. a Chinese slave woman captured in
â¢Â¦ the Federal raid on the houses In Sullivan
* and Baker alleys several weeks ago.
The woman alleged that she was a na
tive of San Francisco and -had been taken
to China at an early age, and on returning
to this city had been landed by the Col
lector of Cpstoms as a native of the
United States.
Mr. Movsry's brief on appeal covers all
The legal points Involved in the case. He
contends that Commissioner Heacock had
no power or authority to enter judgment
or 10 order the deportation of the de
fendant: that the Chinese exclusion act is
unconstitutional and void in so far as it
allows the United States Commissioner to
determine the rights of Chinese persons
to be and remain In the United States;
that the United States Commissioner has
no power to punish a Chinese person for
being unlawfully in the United States, or
to convict for that offense; that the judg
ment of United States Commissioner
Heaccck is in violation of sections 1 and
2 of art!cle 3 of tne constitution of the
United States, and cf the fifth and sixth
articles of amendment to the constitu
tion: that the findings are not justified by
the evidence; that there is no evidence
that the defendant is a Chinese person or
a laborer, and that the evidence shows
clearly that the defendant was born in the
United States. Â¦
Judge de Haven set May 23 as the date
for the hearing cf the argument. Should
Mr. Mowry succeed in his contention
It will be almost impossible to con
vict a Chinese person of being unlaw
fully within the boundaries of the United
States. The decision of Judge de Haven
will settle, once and for all. the authority
of the United States Commissioner to
hear and determine such cases.
Mr. Mowry asked Judge de Haven to
admit his client to bail, but the request
was refused.
Says That Commissioner
Heacock Has No
Authority.
Attorney Contends That Parts
of the Exclusion Act
Are Void.

was work in connection with his appoint

had favored. him for Minister. In fact, the

favor of his appointment on the commercial

ago. Their belief- that he could serve the
Interests of the coast and of the country

Well Known on This Coast.
Mr. Barrett has made himself well
known to the mercantile classes of the

lecturing repeatedly upon topics connected
with trade developments in the Far East.
He first appeared before the Chamber of
Commerce in this city after his
from the Orient, when' he made an ad
dress by invitation of the trustees of the
chamber. Since then he has spoken sev
eral times on Far Eastern affairs and has
also been a prolific writer oh the' same
general theme for a variety of publica

These several facts confirm the story
that Barrett will be the Minister to China,

In the dispute of the Carriage Makers' As
sociation and the three unions involved these
are the facts: On May 1 committee* of the
unions met a committee of the association.
Hours, wages and union recognition were
agreed upon. A few days afterward, at a
second conference. 1 members of the employ
ers' committee stated that they could not
agree to the clause guaranteeing the employ
ment of none but union men. They stated
that they did not â¢ "dare" to sign an agree
ment containing that clause. This resulted
In a" walkout of over 400 men.
To-day the written statement of an employ
ing carriage-maker, who had signed the union
agreement, was given to the I>aÂ£>or Council, set
ting forth the fact that a certain firm had re
fused to supply. him. wagon material. This In
cident explains- why the employers do not
"dare" to sign union agreements. The refusal

ing undesirable .help. Again "we state that
"Kecosnltion of the union" does not mer.n
that the union is going to run. the employers'
business. All it means is that all empl^eu
in civen industries .shall pay uniform wases,
work their emsloyes'. certain hours, anrf hire
union men. The union does not interfere /with
the right of the emvloyer to hire and dis
charge men within 'the membership of the
union. The union guarantees to its members
a minimum rate of wages and a certain work
day while employed, but' does not - guarantee
them permanent employment.
Unions Are N"ot Arbitrary.
The recognition , of the . union, . by the : em
ployer .: to the extent of entering; into ' agree
ments to employ none Ibut '-members of the
union is absolutely necessary, in .nearly '.all In
stances to prevent' continual misunderstanding
and friction. "VV'e find that unless such agree
ments are entered into employer and employe
are continually engaged in controversies. While j
at certain times employers are ready to concede I
the wage and hpur schedule we find that where j
union recognition is not agreed to the active I
union . men are very shortly discharged, and j
later on.it is given out, directly or indirectly, I
by the employer that it Is best for men In hlÂ«
employ not to belong to t*.e union. If this
Is not heeded a weedlng-out process begins, re
sulting either in the disruption of the -union
or in a strike. As soon as the. union Is dis
rupted wages go down and the hour3 increase.
The unions having learned this through many
a hard lesson now insist on the principle of
union recognition in making their agreements.
The vLabor Council regrets this; [but -.will in
sist on the right of the. workers, to unite in
trade unions for their protection. Â¦ " Z. â¢ Â¦
The San Francisco Labor Council in "its at
tempts to prevent the spreading of the present!
strikes by arbitration lias failed to secure the,
co-operation of the. Employers' Association, and'
of the Metal Trades Association of the Pacific:
Coast, the two associations comprising the em-;
ployers of this city. The' latter declare that
they have "nothing to arbitrate.?- â¢- â¢> Â¦, ,

Employers Blamed for Boycott.
Secretary Wisler of the International
Association of 'Machinists reported that
seven thousand men would go out on
strike on May/ 20 unless their demands
were granted.' President Davis of the
Journeymen Butchers' Union reported
that prior to "Butchers' day," " May 22,.
they. would have something to say. to their]
employers. Delegates from other unions
reported- similar conditions. of affairs. Â¦ j
Before taking the vote on the matter of
levying a boycott on the restaurants Sec-'
retary Rosenberg read the subjoined ex
planation of the attitude of the Labor,
Council in this matter:.
'It was lone after midnight before a re
sult was reached. . The orators of the La
bor Council indulged in glowing periods,
but all seemed agreed on the one point
that the only way to uphold the dignity
of union organization was to declare
these boycotts.
After the reading of reports from the
difterent unions fcecretary . Hamilton of
_the ..Cooks' and Waiters' Alliance ex
plained the attitude of that organization.
Ho was followed by Organizer Pierce,
who> supported his contentions. Every
delegate who took the floor spoke In favor
of levying the boycott without regard to
its ultimate effect. . â¢
According. to Organizer J. -D. Pierce,
nearly 250 restaurants now display union |
cards and accessions are being made j
daily. It is expected that some of the
larger houses will be unionized: in ample
time to prevent any inconvenience to the
visitors who will throng the city on the
occasion of the President's visit.
By an affirmative vote, which was al
most unanimous, the San Francisco Labor
Council last night decided to levy a boy
cott, on all "unfair" restaurants. .iThe
Seattle Brewing and Malting Company
was also placed -under a ' similar ban.
Time for the investigation of the stand-
Ing of the Morgan Oyster Company 'was
given to the executive committee, which
in one week will determine what action
shall be taken. â¢

accompanying the demands the claim is
made that the Supreme Court in its deci

the city and oounty of San Francisco Is
to be considered as a county, and the
Grand Jury members are entitled to the
