This strange woman antedated by st

pretty as unreal, might be spun of the

when she died and twenty-six, years is a

a chance, and fatal encounter with tho ;
embittered Indian, even for the tender

In the unwritten volumes of tradition,
which serve the Indians as history, there
is no story of the pale-face woman who
died here so many moons ago. The ear
liest Indian leg-nd relates only to - the
tomb, and that evidently was recognized
as some sign made by their divinity. The
Indians who may now occasionally be
found culling the red berries from- the
manzanltas near by. will tell you that

2And - by the 'way, 'If you .'are your own
furnisher, bear in mind that a well-fit
ting collar is the basis of every one of
thesÂ»e treasures that look so simple and
cost so dear. If you have not a good pat
tern, get a dressmaker to cut you one.
There is a dressmaker who so values the
fit of a collar that she is not satisfied with
what cutting alone can do, but she must
needs pull and tug at her lining canvas
until it shapes Itself to the neck in ques
tion without a wrinkle or a pucker. So

perfect, all that follows in a question of
tnsie and patience. Tou either have .these
or not, according as na(ure has endowed
you. Without them in abundance, never
try to make one. of these things. They
are atrociously' expensive ready-made;
this Is because somebody else had to be
paid for having and exercising these very
qualities. Better raise the money or do
without, than wear a clumsily made one.
A dainty affair In white, blue and gold
sells at $8. This is one of the simple ones.
The stock is of tucked white satin; It
Is trimmed with pale blue velvet embroid

in the front. That is In accord 'with: th*
fashion of the day, which pushes hair,
hat, blouse and ribbons all to the front as
if the wearer were followed by a high

One exception to this rule is found in a

The largest thieving -Is done by bank
officials; the second largest by public serv

handling of large sums of money is the
most direct temptation. After this comes
the opportunity for stealing the public

an able Introduction by Major General
Joseph Wheeler. U. S. A.; but the bulk
of the matter Is by Jose de OHvares. the
noted author and war correspondent. H'.j
brilliant descriptions and interesting nar*
ratives form one of the leading featurei
and charm of the work. William S. Bry
an, thp author of several valuable books
on history, has done some excellent work
In carefully arranging and editing the
matter.
The book, -of course, was only Intended
for use in. that campaign, but Captain
Brown carefully preserved it and carried
It with him .In subsequent bat

Captain Brov/n;who. like Lincoln, was
a native of Kentucky, cane over to the
Kepublican forces. He was a man of
blameiess reputation, had Iipcd n life-long:
Whig ar.d. line, many of his party asso
ciates, had kept out of the Republican
party in 1S53. voting for Fillmore. He Wai
a f::ic-iul of Lincoln, and upon his
requfEt lirmily accepted the nomination of
otirulldst Â» for thÂ« LeeiMature.
In San^amon County the feeling was
very inteJis c ajrainst the ne^ro. for many
of the poople before cominp to Illinois had
been accustomed to slavery- Mr. Lincoln
raw c'farly that thfse points would react
severely jirairs? him in the coming cam
paign pnd would prove a. serious obstacle
to th* success of (lie new partv.
Lincoln's position was constantly mls
ftated by his opponents. Â¦ He did not at
that tine i^rr.and the liberation of the
flaves then in bondaire.. nor did he ad
vocate negro, citizenship, although the
IVmocratic orators, and newspapers in-
Flstently cr;arpe<5 him with standing for
the equality- cf the races both politically
and sncia!!y.
The book was callpfl forth by the cam
paign of 1O. when the opposing candi
dates for I'nited Plates Senator from Illi
nois were Abraham :IJneoln and Stephen
A. Douglas.. The issue was slavery â
whether it should be restricted to the
States where It. already existed, as Lin
coln held. <?r whether it should be per
mitted In new territories, as Douglas con
tended. -
This little book Is of especial Interest
because it !s the enly one ever written or
crmplied by Abraham Lincoln. The only
extraneous matter in the. memorandum Is
an explanatory rote by J. McCan Davis,
In xvhirh he teKs us the reason for the lit
tle volume's existence.
This memorandum was made up In part
of newspaper clippinps of- Lincoln's
er^eches nt that time. Each one of these
hes an explanation in h!s own hand, and
the tas; one Is followed by a letter to
Hon. J. N. Brown explaining the author's
views on the subject discussed.

"Our Islands and Their People" Is prob

published. It is being put on the market
by subscription in twenty-fcur parts of
thirty-two quarto papes each. -These
twenty-four parts bound together make
two large volumes â reference books with
out which no library is complete. The ob
ject of these papers is not to treat of thd
!ate war with Spain â tliat is merely taken
up incidentally In so Â£ar as It Is a'mat
ter of history. The work covers far moro
ground than that. It presents as com
plete a view of the late Spanish islands
as the tourist or pleasure-seeker could
obtain by visiting them in person.

This. Is an AgÂ« of, lethargy and vloel -
With ctlmulants 'are all our senses fedâ
The patient eoul Is mads a sacrifice,
To pay for pleasures of the heart and head,
While soft narcotics numb with nervoui
dreadâ
No wonder that Its splrit-stfrht Is dlmm'd.
An& God the further off. Love's lamp half
trlmra'd! ' .
To lust Is not to love â Love scorneth lust! â
How can^t thou say "I love!" and Love deflleT
For Ixive is i-everent, tender of its trust, '
And could not stoop to any thought of guile,
, Ix>ve knows no wantonness, no Devil's wile!â
True love Is a perpetual sacrifice.
Whose smoke in heaven-ascending thoughts
doth rite.

By and by McGee was given away -to an
admiring neighbor and McOaw was stolen
'by an admiring thief, so I was' obliged to
devote, myself to the observation of Billy.
He. was certainly a most interesting crea
ture to watch. The first Intimation ' I had
that he inherited a love for' bathing was
one day when I had been making photo
graphs -and came In to find Billy . In a
tray . of â¢ water on the dining-room . table,"
and dancing nil over ; a , batch of prints
which I had left "to soak.' He looked aw
Â¦ fully wet and bedraggled, but supremely
, happy, so : as Â¦ the prints were ruined al
ready, I let him finish his bath in peace. Â¦
After, that I always left a porcelain vea
>el full of water under the trees for him.
came strong enough and even before they
coqld -fly they' went Into tho barn Â¦ and
hopped upstairs' themselves.
. " Th'eir incessant cawing in -the" daytime
brought scores of other crows to the gar
den. These would circle about above the
heads of the little ones, calling 1 loudly, as
though .trying, to coax them away.
In a week or7 two the youngsters got
the use of their wings and flew about
from the barn to the house.- never failingr
to advise us when they weTehungry. They
Boon gave up the use of the loft as a bed-'
room and roosted' In the trees Instead.
But np matter Â¦where they were an Imi
tation of their, voices was always enough
to bring them sailing in to be fed. We
called them Billy, McGte and McQaw. af

He never cared to batne two flays run
ning in the same water, but when- he saw
me coming with a fresh supply he would
sail right Into his bath and slide along on
Its slippery bottom. Though he consid
ered himself a member of the family be.
would never allow any rough familiarity
.from any one. "We mfght stroke or
scratch his head if we did it gently, par
ticularly If the caresses were accompa
nied by a soothing or apologetic tone of
voice, but If any one passed a hand light
ly down his back with an abrupt "Hullo,
Billy I" he would give a snarling "caa"
and seize the offending finger In a grip
which took ft piece out if -the hand was
removed too suddenly.
' The cats were no match for* him at all.
Even before he could fly - he had ".Â» su
preme contempt for them. One day when
he was little . more than a fledgling he
was preening his feathers under a tree,
when I saw- our biggest cat stalking him
through the grass. Like . a tigress she
drew . herself along until within a few
feet of the moving feathers, and then she

E the crow, 'as the Frenchman puts it.
: Is not bo devil as he's black. If: he
he would certainly be very devilish,
for nothing. In the anirnnl kingdom is
blacker than the craw. As u matter pf
fact, however, he Is not half a- bad fel
low, and It Is rather surprising that, his
real character Is so little known and ap
preciated. He is one of the commonest
of birds, being found In nearly every State
In tbe Union and away north to .the fur
countries, and his large size and conspicu
ous color make it almost Impossible to
mistake him for anything else. In this
pert of the country at least, 1
Yet he has been misunderstood for cen
turies. Even: now very few people give
him credit for his many good qualities.
Superstitious folk have always endeav
ored to make his character, match his
plTiznage. and a list of wicked tntngs he
Is Bald to have done would fill a large
-volume. He has been called. an enemy of
the farmer, the plague of the gardener
and a bird of 111 omen. He has been ac
cused of stealing the corn, sucking the
eggs and eating the chickens and often
of alighting on the backs \ of sheep to
Bteal wool for his nest.
So firm has been the belief in his vjl
laicy that In many places a price has been
set upon bis bead, and one State of this
Union has a record of having paid a
bounty on forty thousand dead crows in
a single eeason. : '.?:-*;
There Is no denying that many, of .the
r lories told against him are true. I, for
â¢or.*, should not care for the task of estab-
UsM&g his reputation as a saint, but fair
play is a jewel, and when his blackness
gets It every farmer in the land will
know that he has many a .worse friend
than James Crow -Esq. .'" Then the irreea
landscape will not be' aiÂ»2gTiiÂ«d by the
disreputable \ scarecrow, aÂ«d â¢ tho â¢ dead
body of the handsome black bird will no
longer bÂ« nailed on the end of the barn
as a warning to evildoers. â¢Â¦â¢
He is one of the wisest birds' we have
(It he were not he would be extinct),' and
tliJs Is probably due to the fact that he
isi very observant and: very Inquisitive.
He sees everything which goes on around
him, and finds out as much about it aa
ho can without exposing himself to dan
ger. Every ! unusual sound and every
strange sight is taken note' .of by the
crow and Investigated at a safe distance.
"We begin to find crow's nests In the
early part of April. I have seen some in
cedar trees less than twenty feet up, and
ethers In tail . pines -and chestnuts, per
haps seventy: feet above the ground. They
are bulky, iaffairs, made .chiefly of sticks
and lined with wHd grapevine bark.
grass, moss and other softish materials,
and sometimes mud and hair are used.
The. eggs. ' from three to six In number,
are about one and three-fourth Inches
long and usually bluish green,;- with
brown markings. They differ very. much
In color, however, some being so heavily
marked as to be almost solid brown",
while others are pale blue and sometimes
even white, : with few or no markings.
Both birds assist in the Incubation of the
eggs. The male Is very attentive, of ten
bringing food to bis mate- while she Is
sitting, and relieving her when she is
tired. ''*:'{:\'i ' '
The eggs are hatched In about a fort
night, and the young remain in the n&st
about" five weeks. Kven after leaving
home the family remains together for
s=ome time . =
Last spring I took from tbe nest three
young 1 crows. Just four weeks .old- 'Â¦ ThÂ«y
' were most unpromising .creatures,, with
big heads, clumsy feet and heavy bodies
covered with plnfeathers. They were. Ut
terly lacking- In the brightness and' alert
ness so noticeable' in young hawks of lew.
than. half their age, and looked about as
stupid as" any birds I' ever saw. The first
day It was considerable, trouble to feed
them; after that It .was 'considerable trou
ble, not to feed them. I dug them some
worms, and after trying In vain to coax
them to eat, I was oblUred to open their
mouths and push the food down. ' As thin .
Interesting occupatK.^ took up more time
than I cared to devote to It, I 'thought I'd
try an experiment. . I pet -upa noise, in
tended to imitate the cawing of a crow.
Bad as It was, It worked like a charm.
The three huddling black 'Â¦ things seemed
to have . received a galvanic shock-'three
long^necks were stretched - upward and
three .red caverns yawned for food. After
that they were a nuisance, and cawed al
most . incessantly - from dawn until" dark.
It would have been Impossible to "forget"
to feed them. .. â¢
Whenever I out in an appearance they
hopped through the- longest grass and fol
lowed me all over the garden. Often when
I' was digging they narrowly escaped be
ing cut in two with the spade. ' Â¦
Their' period of dullness and stupidity
.was -short. They grew rapidly, and be
came niore Intelligent avery day. At first
I used to. carry them up to the hayloft
every avening, but as soon aa they bc-
suddenly rushed upon . her 'prey as . shW..
had done upon a hundred other birds. beV
fore. But this time she. did. not reach her;,
mark. Something In thÂ« appearance or...
the creature caused her to pull- up. ' ;â¢ 'Â¦ "â¢ "
As she did so the youn? crow- turned "
rour.d and- gave a distrusted "caw." and'-,
the cat fled . toward the boussfe " as thouglx - : '
the devil wÂ«iÂ« after her. Afterward, when.
the bird was . almost full : ' grown and â¢
walked about the garden with, a stately :
stride, and with his Iridescent black piu> â¢Â¦
mags flashing In the sun. he'would'some-'
tfmea spy the cats feeding at their dlsht .
sear the back door. If he happened to bÂ«
hungry he- Just marched over,. Jumped :
into the middle of the dish and scattered Â¦ Â¦<
the cats with a few vigorous cawÂ», helped
himself and walked away again. ' â¢
On the top of the icebox, in the back '
porch, there was always a bowl of bread â¢
and. milk for Billy* Â¦ special use. When ha
was little he was fed by hand, but when
he grew older he came In. lifted uj> tha
cover and took what he wanted.' Bat hÂ«
could never be taught to cover the rest
up when he went away.
Re wanted to do almost ' anything he '

caterpillars were being removed from th*

Into the Job, and If any one was picking

too. But he always ate hla Instead of put
ting them into the basket.

I miles icutheast of Paris. The
siege of Troy had its Homer, and
perhaps some: poet of the Department 'of
Aube will ret rise to sin? the siege -of
Troyes. In some ways it was as remark
able, for during five days or.e old man
and his faithful dog defied the civil au
thorities, the gendarmes and a ' rcjr'.nie'nt
of foot chasseurs; and part of this titne
he waÂ« dead. It was an affair which re
minded one of the famous "Fort Cham*

case. . "..'.' :
Isidore Nicholas Coquard, a stone break
er.. G2 years old. living in a fcuburb ofthe
tcirn, was caught stealins cabbages from
a. neighbor's garden. Two gardeners
chased him, and one fired a.charge of sshot
Into the old man's leg, but he escaped in
the darkness and proceeded to barricade
himself In his house. Next morning, fol
lowing the trail of blood, the offlceri-bf
the law came to arrest him. Admittance
was denied, and they were sternly warntd
away by Co<;uerd, who enforced his orders
by pointing a shotgun at them out of -one
of the Upper, windows. Then came :the
magistrates with all thrir pomp and lejral
authority to threaten or coax the thief.
Or. peelr.g a gun covering them they fled
precipitately. It began to be rumored
about that the old man had a lot of stolen
poods ia his house and would never' be
taken alive. :."- ;
The gendarmes were sent for, and they
formed a cordon around the house. To
the aid of the gendarmes came a detach
ment cf the First Foot Chasseurs, ar.dthe
siege was fairly bejrun. Anyone approach
ing the house was fired on immediately
by Coquard. A faithful dog, who kept
hlXSKlf concealed either in the house, or
behind angles of it and other natural cov
ers when he went out, Rave warning of
any attempt to approach the door. In the
darmes Â¦ and the Police Commissioners.
Soon after the Prefect himself appeared.
All. the chief official? of the Department
cif Aube being now assembled, the major,
accompanied by a soldier with a loaded
rifle, approached to within a few yards
of .the besieged.. house and ; cried out as
before. "Coquard! Coquard!" This time,
however, no one appeared at the window,'
no sound of the cocking of a- gun -was
heard. Only the dog came out into the
courtyard and barked for a few moments.

"Not Jasper, " but his assistant, in
whose hinds my friend has confided the
duty of clearing up a rather unpleasant
affair that threatens disaster not only to
the academy but likewise to poor Jasper
himself. To come at once to the point,
the students at the Covington military
academy have for a long time been the
victims of petty theft. In fact, the
trouble has extended over a period of
four years, and though every effort has
Â¦been made to unearth the offender the
affair is now a darker mystery than be
fore. When I looked into the matter,
some three years since, it was at the en
treaty of Jasper's assistant, the Rev. Dr
Skerrett, who seemed to feel keenly the
shadow that had fallen across the path
of his Worthy superior. I undertook the
case purely out of friendship for Jasper,

home last Tuesday, of which he spent
$7. To-night his room was entered,
probably while he was at tea. and the
remaining $90 taken from the trunk.'
" 'Who? How much?' Jasper's inter
ruption showed only too clearly the aw
ful presentiment that tortured him.
"Dr. Skerrett looked first at me. then
at Jasper; a shads of pain passed over
his kindly countenance. 'It is my duty,
doctor' â and his voice trembled with
emotion â 'to report another â ' . /
" 'Do not hesitate, Skerrett.' said my
friend, as if to ease the embarrassment
of his assistant. 'Chief Barker is one oi
my oldest acquaintances, come to. our
aid. You- may speak freely.'
"As we left the dining hall Jasper'in
dicated that he desired to see me in his
private office. We were closeted alone
r'or perhaps forty minutes, examining di
agrams, reading records and discussing
in all its bearings this dark and most ex
traordinary affair, when a sharp knock
arrested our attention. The door opened
without further ceremony, and there
stood Dr. Skerrett, his face the picture
of consternation and alarm. At that mo
ment I turned to Jasper. His cheeks
were the color of this ash from my cigar.
His lips were trembling under the press
ure of sudden shock.
"Events transpired after my arrival in
rapid and startling succession. .At tea
that â¢ evening I sat at the right of mv
friend Jasper, and -never have I seen a
man so changed by misfortune. Sker
rett, in turn, was at .my right, and then,
after he had said grace, you can imagine
my surprise to see Heenan enter the hall
and take a seat at Jasper's left. He
bowed to- me pleasantly, and the meal
ended without further incident
He handed me the paper and. taking his
hat, walked out the door. " â¢ '
"My first impulse was to detain him,
but on second reflection I chose another
course. I felt keenly for poor Jasper.
Ought. I noj, as his friend, take a oer
sonal.hand in this dastardly business,
which was. bringing swift ruin to a good
and upright man? more I thought
of it the more I felt convinced that such
was the only course. In less than an
hour I boarded a train for Covington.
. "To be sure* Pardon my abstraction.
In my advancing experience I observe
more and more the great value of repu
tation and success. In younger years I
could not have settled poor Heenan so
easily. But that is neither here nor
there. There's been another theft at Co. v
ington, quite different in its aspects from
the others, and involving only a small
amount â $3, I believe. Skerrett very
properly believes that one of the new
students may be trying to emulate poor
Heenan, and on his advice Jasper, who
is quite upset over the affair, is deter
mined to nip it in the bud. Skerrett
said the money was abstracted from one
of the boys' coats during a football
matchâ undoubtedly the act of one or
his schoolmates.'* . : : - /.

"I am glad you think sa" returned-
The chief ceased to speak, and I wait

just now? That was from the school?"
"The death was so clearly suicidal that
after a prompt inquest by the coroner
the matter was hushed up without an-/
shadow falling on the school. Indeed,
fiom that day the thefts ceased, and the
academic year, the fourth since the
trouble began, closed without further
sensation â the best evidence that instire
had bestowed her righteous punishment
in her own good way."
"'Yes,' I answered, appearing to ig
nore the compliment, however it might
be deserved.
"Skerrett was equally distressed. 'I
am grieved,' he said gently. 'Heenan
was one of your own men. Chief; and,
seeing you here to-night, he felt the
sure hand of destiny.'
"For a full minute none of us spoke.
Then Jasper, with a half-sob, said: . VI've
been a blind fool, but I would have for
given him. Heenan, my poor friend!'
And he knelt over the prostrate body
and wept like the great, noble, big
hearted child he was.
" 'That the poor fellow preferred sui

still no sign of either. The clock was

"Jasper and I jumped to our feet in

you miss him?'
"'Hurry to the station. Skerrett.* I
said. 'You are in Jasper's confidence,

different with Jasper. He was my friend,
and I liked him. : -
"Something did happen, and in a
quarter that gave me little . surprise.
About six, months. ago the sum of $85
was stolen one Sunday while the boys
were at tea. The news was brought the
following day by Heenan himself, who
had spent the entire: Sunday and night
as Jasper's , guest. When ,1 thereupon
suggest-d to Heenan that he return for
a further investigation of the affair h-i
not only flatly refused but went directly
to his desk and wrote his resignation.
"Meanwhile three academic years had
passed. The enrollment of students had
dwindled to such a degree, and the finan
cial returns showed such increase of loss.
that it was only a question of time when
Jasper would have to close up his career
and become in his declining years a mis
erable bankrupt. My heart bled for my
poor friend who did so much to make
my own boy the fine, manly fellow he is.
Yet I could do nothing but turn the
problem over in my mind and wait for
something to happen.
"All these suspicions I put aside for
further reference and awaited develop
ments, though hblding firmiy to the
same opinion that the active figure in
this mystery, whoever he might be, was,
if not one of the boys ("which I doubt
ed), at least some one familiar with the
workings and habits of the school.
"I was not prepared to make accusa
tion to that effect, for I was loth to be
lieve that, after .the summary manner In
which I. had dealt with Dreicer. another
of my force could have the hardihood to
tempt a similar fate. Dreicer, you re
member, got fifteen years.
'â¢;However, I could not be blind to the
fact that Heena.n had been on terms of
. friendship with Jasper since the year he
spent three weeks in Covington on a
successful" arson case.' I also happened
to ; kn<5\y that lie still ran down occasion
ally- for a Sunday's dinner. In addition,
he 'should have found much assistance in
the advice and unselfish activity of Dr.
Skerrett, who -was- regarded by the'boys
rather .'as champion ' and friend' than as
â¢ preceptor, and whose- daily, occupation,'
as : required by" Jasper, was merely to
preside at morning- prayers, teach one
â¢ hour of Latin and one of Biblical his
tory. The remainder of his time he was
to- place at the: disposal of my man, Het
â¢ na'ri. However,- as the thefts always
ceased during Heenan's- official residenre
at the academy, as he invariably returned
empty-handed; and as, after periodical
investigations,' the thievery and ; his so
cial visits were resumed almost simulta
neously, I may as well confess that, In
my opinion, Heenan' knew "more about
the matter than he had cared to disclose.
."Three separate times did he under
take the task, each time with greater re
luctance, and three separate times did he
return without so much as a clew. It
can be imagined that by this time mv
confidence in Heenan was beginning to
wane. Already, that year I had un
earthed a robbery in which one of my
own trusted detectives, a .man named
Drciccr, proved to be a confederate, and
naturally I could not but fear that â well,
never mind what I thought. I have no
wish to be. unjust; moreover, there wns
nothing as yet to give proof to my opin
ions. ' . " :'. . Â¦': . -
"Under Heenan everybody and every
thing was subjected to the most rigid
observation, but though during his resi
dence at the academy the thefts wholly
ceased it proved impossible to locate the
culprit or even to arouse a tangible sus
picion. No sooner had Heenan given
up the search as hopeless and returned
to New York than the complaints broke
out afresh. Boys who had lately re
ceived money from home were th? usual
victims, and their losses ranged all the
way from Co cents to $85. In spite of
the. fact that their beloncrincs were se
curcly locked in their, trunks it was no
uncommon occurrence for a lad to re
turn from recitation or drill or the ball
Held to find his desk pried open and his
motiey gone. Then there was more ex
citement, another urgent summons from
Skerrett aiid another failure on the part
of Heenan.

ansly good hitherto, left a' bare $3000 of

a son."
"He is the commandant of our mili

companionable."
I was struck with this remark, half
revery, half regret, but said nothing and
presently withdrew.
Going to my room at the hotel. I pro
ceeded to master the facts as Chief Ba;l
ker and his friend, the principal, had
laid them before me. Thinking to dis
pose at once of the least probable of mv
hypotheses, from the chief's point of
view, I based theories on the first as
sumption that the last robbery and those
culminating in Heenan's death were
; parts of the same bold scheme. What,
then, were the. facts to be held in mind?
The thefts, first and last, had now cov
ered a period of more than four year?.
Since the complete academic course re
quired a residence of precisely three
years, it was obvious that students â¢ :si
dent at the academy when the robberies
began might not be suspected of recent
offenses. Conversely, it was equally ab
surd to assume that any student now res
ident knew anything of the original
crimes. Thus, one might have started
the plan and passed his profitable secret,
as a sort of class heritage, on to another.
But, to i&y mind, this was most improb-,
able. It^was, however, beyond perad
venture that the culprit was to.be found
among those permanently resident at the
academy. His intimate knowledge of
the boys' secrets and habits allowed no
other hypothesis." Eliminating, there
fore, the boys themselves from the prob
lem, there remained only twenty-eight
other persons otherwise permanently
living at the school. Of these seventeen
included the faculty and their wives, ten
were servants, and the other was the
military son of the reverend principal.
The thefts had occurred* at irregular
intervals and ranged in amount from $3
cenis to $93. Of these amounts I had

But a well-aimed blow from the cap

looking paper cutter and made a vicious
lunge at my throat, sent him prostrate
across the table. Meanwhile i slipped a

hurled in their midst. Skerrett jumped
to his feet, livid with murderous rage.
"You lie! You lie!" he shrieked. "Bv.

There was a moment of vital suspense.
The three faces at the table turned
deathly pale; I alone was undisturbed.
'"If you will glance at the gentleman on
your rights' I continued, "you will see
the most monstrous thief unhung."
"I am quite satisfied, Dr. Jasper," I
answered quietly. "But I think the case
is now beyond even their efforts."
"Do I understand that von have a
clew, Mr. Sleek?"
I smiled. "Something rather more
tangible, Doctor."
"In brief, Mr. Sleek. I could not bring
myself to withhold from them the true
purpose of your presence here. And I
think you will approve my action when
you learn what infinite assistance they
can be to you."
"I trust you will not regard what I am
about to tell you in the light of an indis
cretion â above all. not as an -intrusion

and my son have been in mv confidence

I acquiesced. The affair was taking

Dr. Skerrett.
"You are come in jrood time. MÂ«\
Sleek," said he.'
I took the seat he indicated at the va
cant side.
As for Skerrett himself, he joined the
faculty of a well-known institute in the
South, where he resumed his teaching
of the classics and Biblical history.
Nothing more was heard of him until,
shortly after the death of his wife, he
took passage for England, whence he
sailed for the missionary fields of South
Africa. Apparently the following letter

He took bis sweet little wife with him,

young Jasper applied his best energies
to restoring consciousness to his un

suddenness of the shock, had swooned
in his chair.
Fifteen minutes parsed before I was
admitted to the presence of the lea'ned

quite unnecessary, in view of the impor
tance of my errand. Evidently a con
sultation had been in'progress. for at the

I assure you it was a remarkably brief
space of time before I had returned tc
the town and called at the Covington
bank. The, cashier was good enough to
supply the- information I desired, and,
equipped with thisâ and the iron barâ I
returned to the- academy.
On the first impulse I let him follow
alone his hidden lane; on the second
I tossed aside my cigar and likewise
took the mysterious path. He was some
distance in advance and quite out of
sight. But there was no need of a
trail. The almost tangible aroma of the
matchless Perfecto I had seen between
his lips had nbt yet sifted away through
the dense foliage. It bore me directly
onward until I saw the discarded cigar
end, still smoking, where he had thrown
it beneath the bushes. I was just in
time to see Skerrett carefully extract a
dainty package from one of his pockets
and with it enter the pretty house of the
widow Cassell. I waited. Two hours
passed before he emerged and retraced
his course down the lane and thence up
the highway to th: school.
Could it be possible that Skerrett. top,
was after the phantom? If so, what
could it avail him, since he was happily
wed and cosily harbored at the academy,
where I had met his charming little wife
Indeed, the mother indulged the
daughter in this folly, to the ruin ' of
many an ampler purse than that of
young Captain Jasper, who. I learned
with eager interest, was her one faithful
admirer. There were others, and many
of them, who had plunged and lost dur
ing the five years Mrs. Cassell and her
daughter had lived in Covington. but
her favor waned when fortune fled, and
only they who financially could stand
the pace were now in the running.
So far as I could learn from careful
inquiry no shadow rested on either the
mother or the Kill, save a frank and
open liking for the attention of men and
an aggravated case of a not uncommon
feminine weakness â iove of costlv rai
ment and fine line:*, not to mention
gems and precious stones.
Scarcely had the Perfccto and I set
tled to ease when my eye caught the
shadow of a familiar figure coming down
the road. Not that I was surprised to
sec Dr. Skerrett at this hour or in this
place, but I felt that if he were not about
unusual and hidden business he would
walk straight on like a man. wilh fewer
backward glances over his shoulder and
less attempt at concealment. His path
lay towartl the station, but when h>:
reached a point within ioo yards of the
hotel he turned abruptly to the right

reflected that the morning's efforts had
failed dismally to establish my theorv.
However, far from surrender. I realized
the necessity of reorganizing my efforts.
To soothe my mental agitation I lighted

been careful to require an accurate list
of Dr. Jasper, together with the exac:
dates on which the losses occurred.
Thus I had a complete record of the
scoundrel's operations, and it came to
me that if I could in any way verify this
list I sliould be on the track of my man.
But to accomplish this was the prob
lem, since such a list â if, indeed, oii^i
existed â would assuredly be among the
secret possessions of the culprit him
self. Accordingly, next morning, while
the boys and their tutors were immersed
in their studies, I procured the keys cf
Dr. Skerrett on the pretense that I was
to survey the premises for the new wir
ing, and, armed with those and my floijr
plans, prosecuted a most dilfecnt and
careful search. I found no list, as I hid
hoped, but in the rooms of a student
named Becks I unearthed the short iron
bar with which undoubtedly the trunks
and doors had been forced open. But I
was not yet prepared to abandon tlic
present hypothesis for the firstâ that ths":
last â¢ theft was apart from the others.
Consequently I set aside the iron bar
for future use.
There was indeed no need of a signa
ture. I saw the letter on the occasion oÂ£

when, through mistaken friendship, he
ventured to read it to the chief.

However,. to azwid shocking our

son must be gradual. In many cli
matcs the change is, indeed, grad

road is never so smooth; it goes up

cipitously, and there is where the
imprudent zvayfarer meets with ac

beneficiary members of nature all
the year round, it is only sensible to
graciously step out to receive the
benefits of this instrumentality. The

a weaker heart.
We should realize that the more
rapidly the blood circulates the more
body heat is produced, and that

the best means by zvhich to promote
a rapid circulation of the blood.

we cultivate our nerves and bring
them to the standard of the season

quently come in touch with it, how
ever cold its atmospheric features
may be, welcoming it as it were, not
from behind a heated barricade,
like timorous people, but in the open
air, with due precautions, but fear
lessly. The fall and winter, like
the spring and-summer, are the in
struments with which the super

fields of nature, and as we are the
Concerning the cure of whatever
predisposition may exist when en
tering the cold season, we must lay
great stress upon the course of life
to be pursued through the fall, and
later through the zvinter; upon it
depends not only, the prroention of
colds, but the general health itself .
PREVENTIONâ In taking up\
the consideration of the preventive
means, let us realize this plain fact,
that in order to fare safely through
the fall and zvinter we must, qs ii^
zvere, be equipped with fall nerves
and zuinter nerves, for our summer
nerves are not suited to those sea
sons. Such nerves we acquire
by adopting such means as will
avoid or cure the predisposing
cause and insure safety against the
exciting causes. The predisposing
cause can always be avoided if the
tone of the nervous system is kept
up during the .summer by cold baths
or cold spongings. If this cold ap
plication be resorted to twice a xveek
during the summer \ and continued
once a week through October, no
predisposition will gain control of
the nervous system. A good rub
bing of the skin shoidd be a part of
the sponging operation.
Let us add, hozvez'cr, that a so
called "cold" is often the result of
inlialing an irritant substance, such
as nocuous dust, germ-laden air,
dense smoke, noxious gases, the fly
ing pollen of plants and trees, etc.;
but even in this case the nerves
zvhich are not toned up by frequent
outings stand as a predisposing
cause, and a chilling of the body as
an allied exciting cause. It is the
action of the irritant substances in
haled zvhich makes the hose, throat
and lungs our weakest spots, be
cause irritation causes congestion
and redness of the part, exactly as
mustard does when applied to the
skin. It is also a positive fact that
when the effect of the irritant sub
stance is rather severe it produces
the catarrhal condition termed "a
cold" without the aid of any allied
cause. This explains the so-called
"colds" contracted in the summer.
Hence we find that the debilitat
ing influence that the long summer
heat or constant liz'ing in warm
rooms exerts upon the nervous sys
tem is the predisposing cause to this
disease in the fall and winter, and
that a prolonged exposure to fold,

tightened up its grasp, that is,
zvhile the disease is yet in its con
gestive stage, if the people know
what to do at the proper time.
Having said that the cause of a
"cold" is a loss of equilibrium in the
circulation of -the mass of blood,
that the condition present in zuhat is
termed "a cold" is an overflow of
blood in a zveak part, that this over
flow is induced by an impression of
cold on the external surfaces which
drives the blood inzvard, or by the
local effect of an irritant substance,
and that heat, contrdrily to cold, at
tracts the blood to where it is ap
plied by relaxing the skin, every
body should now be able to clearly
see the natural remedy or rational
freatment to abort a "cold" at its
ABORTIVE TREATMENT OF
A "COLD."
A "cola" can be ' very easily
PROPER TIME TO ACTâ
The proper time at which to apply
the abortive treatment is marked by
the following symptoms: When
ever after exposure to cold without
exercise or sufficient clothing, a pain
or oppression is felt in the chest, or
sides of the chest, it means that the
lungs are congested, i. e., thai the
Other very helpful measures in
this case are: A hot drink with
a dose of brandy, or ten grains of
quinine in one dose, which may be
repeated in six hours. Â¦"â¢
By thus restoring the lost body
heat we reverse the circulation, re
establish the equilibrium of the
blood-stream and check the further
progress of the trouble before it
â¢reaches the inflammatory stage.
The object to be sought in the
abortive treatment is to draw the
blood to the parts devoid of it, such
as the extremities and the skin,
thereby reducing the internal pres
sure and relieving the congested
part which is about to give way.
This end is best reached by taking a
full hot bath to which a cupful of
mustard may be added to increase
its effect. In the absence of a bath
tub a sweating in bed will be found
quite as efficient and even better
than a hot bath, and should be pre
ferred by. all whenever the "cold"
contracted is suspected to be severe.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
The woman who in zvinter
dreads *io go out, or retains her chil
dren indoors, is swayed by a foolish
misconception , and endangers the
health of her children, and her ozvn
by ignoring the law upon which life
is founded. We are the natural off
spring of this earth, and as such
we must be able to live on it under
its natural atmospheric: conditions,
whatever they are. This reason is
founded upon the facts that' the
nerves have the property or power
of becoming akin to the conditions
they are gradually subjected to.
Owing to this, if our body be kept
seasonably clad and. physically act-
assumes a winterly attitude- we
must seek to be in harmony with it
by donning zvinter clothing, and
when outdoors by keeping our mus
cles active instead of ungraciously
criticising the character of the
weather in a standstill attitude.

mentioned, to avoid acquiring the
predisposition to contracting "colds/"
in the fall and winter; now we
must say that cold friction follozv
ing 7 warm bathing is the best pro
cedure by which to cure that* same
predisposition , when it has been
acquired. This should be resorted to
at the very beginning of the fall and
methods of life closely related to the
season itself . By this relation we
mean that human life should often
be associated with the outside
zueatJier in every season, because the
natural temperature of the season is
the best remedy to cure our predis
position to taking cold; we mean
that the people who live in warm
rooms day and night are those who
fall easy victims to the cold weather,
because they, as it were, "keep out
of the season," and furthermore,
wither and die prematurely.
It is much' to be deplored that so
fezv people should knozv that tlie
cold temperature tones up the nerv
ous system in the same proportion
as heat prostrates it. In fact, dur
ing the fall and winter we regain
the. nerve power that we have lost
during the summer. But this high
ly important point, though quite
conceivable, is so little realized that
a great many people shun the gen
erous and rcvigorating temperature
surfaces, and thus supply the skin
with blood and heat. The inference
to be drawn from this is that the oc
cupants of carriages and sleighs
are those most liable to take cold; a
long drive in severe cold zveather
may induce . a catarrh, notwith
standing any amount of clothing.
It is, of course, equally dangerous
for ladies to allozu an interesting
topic to retain them out in the < cold
in a motionless attitude.
When a "cold" has not been
aborted; blood oozes out of the cir
culatory system into the affected
tissues, and the trouble must then
run its course; the extravasaled
blood is there as a foreign matter,
and it has to become decomposed in
order that it may be expectorated.
The first symptoms of a "cold?
in the head, which mark the proper,
tinie to resort to the abortive treats
ment,are drynessand a prickling or.
itching sensation in the nose, sneez
ing and the beginning of a sense of t
fullness in the head. If waiting
until the next symptoms appear,
such as closure of the nose, running
secretion, headache, a well develop
ed fullness of the head, and some
times a tension and pain in and
about- the eyes, the. treatment will be
mitigating, but not abortive. '(:'Â¦
The same abortive treatment aÂ£>
plies as well to a cold in the head or:
throat. Therefore, whenever after,
exposure to cold a sense of dryr.es s
and itching or burning is felt in the.
throat, it marks the beginning of an
attack, and the above treatment is
indicated. But, if waiting until
hoarseness, soreness and cough
have developed, the catarrhal at
tack will be mitigated, but net
aborted. . .
The treatment is no longer,
abortive of a "cold" in the chest ifi
not applied until the cough has de
veloped, though it will mitigate it,
blood is forcibly concentrating
there, and that unless measures are
quickly taken to equalize the distri
bution of the blood throughout the
body, an attack or catarrh or bron
chitis trill ensue. In addition to the
above symptoms, if the body has
been severely impressed by the cold,
stiffness and even pain may be felt
in the limbs, especially the thighs
and in the back.
CUSTOM OF FLORAL OFFERINGS TO THE DEAD.
: In 1 Turkey and certain parts of Asia,
where Mahometans, abound, a Mussul
man's; grave :never. - Is opened a pa In In
tiny case, says an -article in' Meehan'B
Monthly. To avoid the least attempt, the
Braves are huddled together, and imme
diately after \ the 'funeral a cypress is
planted on the "grave, so that their cem
eteries resemble a, sort of forest . In the
Islar.d of Timor funeral* often are rttardr
ed through, the necessity of collecting
funds for the funeral feler. Ai.tcoa ae the
grave is filled up a young palm Is planted.
The custom of floral and plant offerings
In homage to the dead has " been general
from time Immemorial. The ancient
Greeks not only strewed flowers over the
grave, but also planted asphodel and
mallow, because the seeds of these plants
were supposed , to serve as food for the
dead - Romans, like the Greeks, attrib
uted a special value to the rose as a
funeral flower, and left Instructions that
after death their graves be planted with
the â¢ favorite flower.
S^AUSESâ There is no ill
I . upon which the public
\^y needs more instruction than
"colds' or catarrhs, the
most common ailment which afflicts
humanity, and yet the people knozv
little or nothing of their real causes
and conditions present. An ex
position of these causes and prac
tical means of prevention and abor
tion in a light suited to the popular
eye will therefore be found of con
siderable importance.
In the first place zee must correct
the popular idea that "colds" are
taken by. breathing cold air, for no
catarrh of the nose, throat or lungs
was ever caused by the circulation
of cold air through them, In the
second place, we must impress upon
the public mind the fact that
"colds" are contracted from a gene
ral chilling of the body, or a severe
chilling- of the entire lower limbs.
When this fact\is well realized by
the people a great stride will have
beat made in the path of progress
and toward thepreveiitioii of this,
so common .ailment. . " I
THe follozving shows hpw the ca
tarrhal process takes place and its.
causes: Cold contracts . the skin,,
and: by so 4oing drives the blood
away from the parts exposed, and,
if ihe expdsitre be prolonged or the.
told very; severe the tissues be-,
Â¦rieath the skin will be affected in the
someway.: The inass of blood thus
drivch inwardly causes the internal
organs to pecome' congested, that is,
overfilled. ~ If this, condition be pro
longed without reaction the tension
causes the \ capillaries [(minutest
blood vessels) to rupture at the
weakest spots. : Some blood then
oozes out of the circulatory s\stem.
and stagnates in the tissues, zvhich
condition is- termed "inflammation
In contrast- to this, I can cite the
case of another girl to whom nature
had been unkind. She had not a sin
gle personal chann outside of small
and delicately formed hands and feet,
both of -which were made much of,
by the way. As compensation for her
ugliness she was given a brain which
landed her at the top of ths line of
fortune's favorites, and she is now
enjoying the fruits of it. I do not
think more than one story will be
necessary to give -an idea of her na
ture. She was dining with a number
of state dignitaries. who* were being
entertained on shipboard. It was a
brilliant occasion, and the epening
course of the elaborate dinner wag
the usual plate of oysters. She took
one and suddenly realized that it was
not all it should be. Just then a
prominent man at her right turned
toward her with a remark which
called for an answer, and all hope of
getting rid of the oyster except by
way, of the throat was gone. It re
quired some will power to avoid a
breach in good manners, but it saved
her from something far more un
pleasant than the flaj-or of a bad oys
terâ-the sacrifice of a position she waa
striving to hold against heavy 'odds.
It was by just such means that she
realized her ambitions and became an
honored member of society, not the
little circle of 400. or so fashionable
and wealthy ' folk, but the big, big
world of refined nien and women. By
tact she won, by tact she will retain
her hold upon the world.

NATURAL CURES IN NERVOUS
DEBILITY OR EXHAUSTION
8
of the cold seasons, and we find
these same, individuals, usually the
better class of zvomen, so fearful
of the winter as to rarely venture
coming in touch with it outdoors,
except in a carriage,^ where they
have to sit motionless.
By folloiving such a method of
life it is safe to say that the iveak,
nervous condition, which is the pre
disposing cause of the autumnal
"colds," will be perpetuated through
the winter, zvhercas if we follozi
the proper course in the fall, -with
due precautions, we can subject mn
nervous system to a gradual toning
up without running the risk of evei
contracting a "cold." But this ton
ing up or renczval of nerve' farce
zvhich people commonly term ''be
coming used to the cold weather'
can be acquired only by following
continued for at least a month.. It
requires two warm batlis per week,
each time immediately followed by
a thorough cold sponging, and rub
bing. Hot water relaxes the skin,
sq that the, blood ; can circulate
through it, while cold water tones
up the nervous system, and, when
combined with friction flushes the
skin with . blood, and thereby pro
motes its health and ihickming.
This method is essentially valuable
to the class of people whose business
occupations predispose to "colds"
during the entire cold season. This
class- includes all persons who work
in warm rooms nearly all day, and
all women or well-to-do ladies ad
dicted to a sedentary life and in
activity. Â¦ Â¦ . .
â¢ The fear that certain persons
have of contracting a "cold" from a
cold sponging is an intolerable ab
surdity, for such an occurrence is
impossible as long as the blood is re
tained in the skin, which prevents
internal congestion. This retention
of the blood in the surfaces of the
body is accomplished by the cold
friction zvhen the skin has been pre
viously relaxed by heat.?â¢We are going," she curtly continued,
and she put his hat on his head and his
overcoat on his back.

One of the .most interesting discoveries
which he has made is that several ajrnple
words used by the chimpanzee are iden

thing. . - . . . â¢ -.
This certainly opens up an Interest

human race is descended from the ape
are generally those .who have not given
the subject .any Investigation.
It Is a fact, says Professor Nor-rls, that
in Hindustan there are tribes of -apes re
garded sacred by the natives, who live
in. villages, building rough huts of
branches and leaves,- having their lead-,

Man in San Francisco Who Claims
He Can Talk With Monkeys.
Were we a city of provincials, as cer
tain disgruntled persons had said? Had
our civilization stopped short at second
girls? -Verily,.! had seen coachmen, but
lers, govurties-u's and ladles' maids, but
whence came they, and, whither did they
go? Of a surety, the "want column"
knew them not.
It still lacked several hours of 2 o'clock;
I put in the time writing notesâtwenty
nvo in allâ to different people, ottering my
services as copyist or secretary..' By the
tlmo I had finished It was 2 o'clock. Feel
ing Just a little queer. I started out to
apply for a position of companion. Need
less to say, I met with- disappointment.
Mrs. A. had engaged a companfon for her
Invalid daughter Just before my arrival.
1 had the poor satisfaction of being: told
that had she not already engaged a wom
an she would have "loved" to havo had
me.
You can't Imagine how I took my first
disappointment to heart, and I must have
looked very woe-begone, for Mrs. A. said,
'I am so sorry. I wish I could help you.
Is there anything I could do for you?' 1
All of a sudden the idea came tome â It
was bo brilliant it fairly staggered me.
"Yes," I replied, "you might. I am a pri
vate hairdresser and manicurist, and if I
could have a few more regular patrons it
would be a great help."
You see, It came about In this way. Mrs.
At last I was usherod into the holr of
holiesâ and I heard myself telling, my
tale.
. I felt like some oife acting the leading
role of a melodrama, and as I went on,
pity for myself or my part almost over
came me, and If a curtain had fallen I
would have taken it as a matter of course,
feeling, that I had iust .finished ny act.-
But my eurtain was just rlEinz. and I
was gradually taken back to earth bv
Mr. B.'s deep' and almost: gentle voice.
The voice went o.i to Quote a lot of n'.ca
I
week had passed and I could get nothing
to do â and "my precious money was fast
slipping away. I found a letter awaiting:
meâ the only answer to all my twenty
five. Mr. B. reaue3te 1 Miss Page to call
that afternoon at n. It was Just ten min
utes to. and I rushed out and got on a
car, almost overcome by conflicting
thoughts. One moment I imagined that
I was about stepping into a pleasant po
sition; the next, that .it was merely a
goose chase and would end In disappoint
ment, : like all the re3t. .
On arriving at the oflce I was requested
to 'wait. Mr. B. was engaged. During
the seeming hours I sat there my ardor
had time to cool. I tried to evolve thij
man from the . surroundings and . finally
rave it up. -decidine that his office and
furniture had evidently landed there from
some chaotic tumbling of the world from
all points of the compass. v -j
We were shown into a room, which has
its counterparts, no doubt. It was velvet
as to carpets, chintz paper as to wail,
showy as to furniture.
A table was set. My host ordered a
dinner, which showed him at oneÂ© a bon
vlvant and an epicure.
Having dined In many climes In my life,
that dinner stands out aa best selected.
He was charmed , to find me an apprecia
tive guest.
We talked of many things and I found
him a brilliant conversationist; He
punctuated his sentences with "Little
woman,'! "my dear," etc., etc. But I en
deavored to avoid personalities, hoping
that by keeping in the middle of the road
I might steer clear of possible smash-ups.
My experience with men had been lim
ited to my brothers, and the men ..one
meets in general; society. From this I
had come to judge the American male as
a rather fair sort of an animal than other
wise. He was not as a rule brutish, and
had a good sense of justiceâ also the truth
of an. old saying had always seemed sen
sible, "It takes two to make a bargain"â
my sisters were. unable to resist. I would
see for myself. "
I turned and with an embarraesed lauch
accepted his invitation. I felt IlkÂ© onÂ«

Do You Know Where All the Furs in
the World Come From?
Â£"r"v HE question was t>eln* discussed oy
1 a number of men and women in
I one of our leading: hotels. They
I represented Quite well the various
.'"'Â¦Jj Â¦' types of our to-called democracy,
and these people asserted that It was next
to impossible for a young woman who had
been brought up amid comforts and lux
ury, untaught In any useful occupation, to
earn h<er bread and butter.
"No," said one, "there are too many
temptations for a girl in Ban Francisco
â why. look at our French restaurants;
they stand a testimonial to our argument
âbut one- third cf tfietr patronage is from
the demi-monde; two-thirds are the. very
class I am speaking: ofâ the girls who hav
been well born and gently bred, who
have been thrust suddenly upon the
world to cam their own living. Can any
other city boast of such a number of
flourishing restaurants? Can any other
city offer cuch inducements?"
"I do not believe it," I said, indignantly.
"All, but you don't know; now take
your own cbm. What could' you do to
morrow?" â¢ " â¢â¢ â¢; ' .:â¢>
"Why," I Btanrr.ered, "Iâ I don't know."
"There you are."
The hot blood rose to my cheek as they
all laughed at rcy defeat. .
"The fault lies," ho continued, "in the
education of rirls. This is a day of spe
cializing. They should be taught to do
one thing well, so that If t"he time shouid
come It will be of market value to them."
From this the conversation drifted to
the educational policy of other countries.
On going to my room that night I pon
dered long on the Question, that had re
mained uppermost In my mind. No, to bo
fure I did not know, but I refused to be
lieve or accept their view, and determined
to find out ror myself and If possible prove
them wrong.
I planned nay course of action. HerÂ«
m-as I a typical ca.se, competent in no one
branch. I had tho usuai smattering of
this, that and the other thing, but It was
too true- What could I do that was of.
market value! . â¢
The next meraJng I left the hotel without
taking a. cent with me. I had. however, a
verv handsome ring, on which I hoped to
realize enough to istert me. This, I con-
slderefl a reasonable thing to flo. ror a girl
usually has something personal of value,
and the pawnbrokers are open to all. I
visited several and was much surprised '.Â«>'
learn that the most they would give me
on it was $C5. I did not leave It, but hur
ried to my brother's office and asked him
to loan me J25 on my ring. To say he was
astounded was putting it mildly. I has
tily told him my plan, at which, of course.
he laughed, and as I left th<Â» ofn>e he
called after me, "I say. Nan. don't be too
rash," on the tall of which I detected
Just the suggestion of a miid sneer.
Rash! ' Indeed. 1 had never been w sane
In all my twenty odd years.
The next thine to do was to secure a
boarding plate. I went to nice In all and
found nothing that a giri earning her own
living could begin to afford â and Just
here, let me say, does she make her lirst
mistake.
She gives almost all she earns for a
miserable attic or hall bedroom that she,
may have her address in a fashionable
neighborhood. â¢. .
Boarding wa* out of the question. 1
must seek lodgings.
Putting the rejjion of boarding houses
behind me I turned my way to North
B*ach. This part of the city, which was
at cue tlnu; a fashionable quarter,
abounds in roomy old-fashioned houses,
long fcince the home of our foreign ele
ment. Here I thought I might possibly
run acres* something suited to my purse.
Almost every other house announced
"Furnished rooms to let," but the major
ity was so uninviting on the exterior thai
1 did not venture In.
I came upon a group of women, how
ever, which attracted my attention. They
wire st-attd on a doorstep, and :he tiling
which caused me to stop was the spotless
white apron on one of them. Looking up
I raw the usual sign, and upon inquiring
I found that she of the apron had a fur
nlthod room to let. I followed h*r up
stairn t>nd she showed ms a room which
was "mine" at once.
It had been newly papered in a dainty,
unobtrusive tan. had two large windows
Â¦with clean ecru curtains shading them
nnd very fair furniture. The Â«un
streamed in, flooding it with light and
warmth.
The price?
Five dollars a month In advance.
I paid it Immediately and said I would
send my trunk on the following day.
nire, tnen, 'was my nifme. F^rofn ,W/Â»
would I work my problem. â¢
HerÂ© was Iâ and my trunk! I had Just
nineteen dollars in my purse t and the
knowledge = of a roof over my h*ad for a
month. I must eat. . I called her Mrs.
Bangs. â¢ I arranged w}th her for break
fast every morning for. 10 cents. At least
I was sure of one meal a day.
I unpacked my trunk and arranged my
ind'.3j?er.gables and few books, etc.,
around the room. I then sat down and
surveyed. my home.- and the vote of one
carried the pouse that it was clean, warm
and comt'cftablo.
Now to work.
I pot a paper and for the first time. In

It v.-ps maddening â
Experienced cook wanted.

I returned to my room one afternoon

Justices and Embassadors.
Some apprehension has been aroused in
the minds of the more liberally inclined
visltprs and residents at the threat of ths
Anti-Saloon League to see that the mid
night and Sunday closing . law Is rigor
ously enforced. The league has appoint
ed a vigilance committee of 100 to keep
watch on the saloons and report any vio
lations of the law. At previous inaugura
tions considerable latitude has been al
lowed by the police in this direction.
Tho Justices of the United Â¦ States ' Su
preme Court will precede the foreign Em
bassadors In the Inauguration ceremonies
in the Senate Chamber, but the foreign
Embassadors will be given precedence in
the procession to the platform where the
President will be sworn in. This is the
dictum of the State Department. Lord
Pauncefote, the British Embassador,
called at the State Department this after
noon arid aa dean of the diplomatic. corps
discussed with acting Secretary Hill the
action of the inaugural committee in plac
ing the Embassadors after the Justices
during the proceedings In: the Senate
Chamber. Hill explained that the Jus
tices represented one of the co-ordinate
branches of the American Government,
and besides participated actively in the
ceremonies, the Chief Justice swearing In
the President. While Embassadors par
ticipate' in the proceedings, they do so . as
spectators, and the State Department in
sists that their proper place in the Sen
ate Chamber isafter the Justices. . - *>
Lord Pauncefote was apparently satis
fied with this explanation, but from what
can' be learned lt,is doubtful If the other
Embassadors will be satisfied. It would
be an Insult to their sovereigns, from
their point of view, ' to be seated after

POPE SPEAKS
ON BIRTHDAY
ANNIVERSARY
Alludes to Dangers
Tliat Now Menace
France.
His Holiness, Though 91,
Delivers a Most Vigor
ous Address.
ROME, March 2.â During the reception |
en the anniversary of the birth and the
cppolntraent of the Pope his Holiness to
day made an address. In. the course of
Â¦which he Eald:
"It is one of God's acts of benevolence
that, enfeebled by age and fatigue, we do
rot succumb under the difficulties -which
Ftlll come to place obstacles before the
free exercise of action lay the church.
Impudence, calumny and other Iniquitous
means are exercised freely against the
church, which alms only at the good of
humanity."
After explaining the situation of civlliz
ction he eulogized those who had ac
quired Importance In the propagation tfi
Christian civilization.
Menaced by Grave Dangers.
"By such importance Catholic France,"
paid the Pope, "is more than ever rich
and justly proud. However, she is actu
ally .menaced on this account by grave
dar.fer?. This, indeed, might be a mis
fortune and a calamity to the intereÂ§ts
of religion end the country if the tem
pest tvhich threatens to disperse such
j^-rious efforts and such fine hopes does
pot turn aside."
The Pope invoked the aid of God to
this end. He accused especlaly the evil
sects which are unanimous in combating
Catholic institutions, in order finally to
destroy them, if that is possible. He
does not. however, fear for the church,
which Is strong in divine promises, and
even draws therefrom a virtue and a new
clcry. His Holiness eulogized Catholics
In the entire world who are tractable,
reverencing the church.
Chief "Regret of the Pope.
His chief regret -was the blindness of
certain men, and he asked -with bltter
ness -what would become of future opera
lions if inspired by such principles, which
are a bad omen. His Holiness reaffirmed
the imprescriptible rights of the apos
toiic See. "of which the Pope Is not the
rrbitor, but a trustee or guardian, whose
duties are eacred." â¢
Alluding to his last encyclical he ealfl
he Judged It opportune to declare that
the "best means of. being useful to man
kind is to watch over that which Is ln
eFiiir.ahle to God. which Is harmony In
til classes." .
Vancouver Officer- Gets Commission

ORDERED TO EOTJTH: AFRICA.
VANCOUVER. B. C. r March 2.â A sen
sation was caused to-day by the receipt
of a commission by Major C. C. Bennett
of this city to Join the new force of con
stabulary for South Africa as second
senior captain. A regiment of 700 men Is
being formed In Canada for police work
In the Transvaal, to go on duty under
General Baden-Powell. Captain Harry
Burstall will be In charge of the whole
of the Canadian contingent, which will
sail from Halifax in two weeks.
Major Bennett came Into notoriety at
the military headquarters at Ottawa two
months ago when ne was reported there
for calling the men of his regiment in
Vancouver a pack of curs. They had not
turned out In a snowstorm to a church
parade and Bennett took occasion to be
rato them soundly. The matter was taken
up by the military authorities and Major
Bennett was dlsclDliried. So strong did
the feeling against him become that he
was obliged to read an apology to the
regiment, assembled for drill, in which he
asked the pardon of every man In the
ranks for the words that had been so
hastily epoken. Thla apology had barely
been made when Bennett received word
that he had been appointed to the coveted
position to go to South Africa.

Daring Boer Leader Reported to Have
Become Demented.
LONDON, March 2.â The Hopetown cor
respondent of the Times, in a dispatch of
February 27, which describes Colonel
Plumer's pursuit of General Dewet, which
has been. continually hampered by heavy
rains, says:
"Since Colonel Plumer's attack at
Wolvekrult. February 15, the invaders
have behaved like harried hare?. The re
port that Dewet had crossed the river
arose from some small parties crossing in
a boat at Marks Drift, where Colonel
Plumer prevented the crossing of tho
main commando and took one hundred
prisoners.
"After, the capture of Dewet's guns,
February 23, the enemy were In full re

hands of the column from Klmberley, but
they slipped. past m the night, recrossed
the railway and are now trying with
Hertzog- to recross the Orange River at
Sands Drift, but Herizog*a commando has
melted away, the majority having been
dispersed or having surrendered. %X
. "Dewet, In hlB fanaticism, is reported
as demented. It !s said that he flogs
everybody and that Haasbroeck.who has
a commando, refuses to co-operate with
him."
LONDON, March 2.â The war In South
Africa has again reached a stage which
the British newspaper critics are pleased
to call the- eve of the termination. Ru
mors of the surrender of General Botha
and the collapse of all Boer resistance
flourish, to the great benefit of South
Africa stocks. That those who are most
responsible for carrying on the war do
not share this optimism is perfectly evi
dent from Mr. Broderlck's official utter
ances and the evidence of his friends, In
cluding Lord Roberts. Their carefully
prepared campaign of thorough organiza
tion which has been quietly maturing dur
ing the past six months is beginning to
have its first results, and they are per
fectly satisfied. The new concentration of
troops referred to so enigmatically by the
correspondents at the front is only one of
the many steps for which General Kitche
ner has so long been preparing. That It
will lead to the complete disintegration of
the more important Boer units and possi
bly to the personal surrender of Generals
Botha and Dewet the British War Office
earnestly hopes.
But It docs not go so far as to expect
It. General Kitchener is almost as reti
cent toward his chiefs in Pall Mall as to
the general public. When he has taken
General Botha Into his camp the War Of
fice expects to hear of it, but not before.
As an official said to a correspondent
grimly, "Armistices are not In Kitchener's
line."
The meeting 1 of General Kitchener . and
Sir Alfred Milner at Pretoria, probably
occurring Sunday, Is generally taken. as
likely to result In the establishment of a
more permanent for^h of civil govern
ment,, in which the "severities of martial
law will be somewhat tempered In sev
eral sections of , the country. But neither
in London nor in South Africa are .the
British officials shutting their eyes to the
fact that they have a long Job ahead of
them, -which can only be lightened and
by no means solved through the victories
over the Boer units.

WASHINGTON. March 2.â One Senator
Â¦tvho was compelled to witness the shelv
ing of a measure in which he was com
pletely' absorbed was Senator Morgan of
Alabama. For years Senator Morgan's
cne aim In public life has been to secure
the construction of the Nlcaraguan canal.
Never had prosjects been no bright as at
the beginning dt the present session.
The failure of the Senate- to ratify the
31ay-Pauncefote treaty, however, made It
certain that any attempt to build the
canal under the existing treaty arrange
ments with Great Britain would be pro
ductive of friction with that Govern
ment, and although Senator Morgan
would not have been deterred by this the
majority of the Senate were not willing
to provoke a quarrel or even a diplomatic
controversy with England and the canal
bill could not be got up for consideration.
.' The Pacific cable bill and the oleomar
garine bill are among the measures of
Importance which- have failed to be en
acted Into laws. Among others are the
anti-trust bill, which passed the House.
and the proposed, anti-trust amendment
to the constitution, which failed of the
necessary two-thirds vote in that body.

CAHDEN', Mo., March 2.â Dewey Smith,
a negro miner, who yesterday shot and
killed Chester Stanley, a whlto miner,
at mine No. 1, four miles .south of Rich
mond, Mo., was captured late last night
and taken back to the scene of his crime
and hlc tody is now hanging to a tree
close to the railroad tracks.
Stanley and 'Smith, alias McNeil, alias
Bob McBrien, quarreled yesterday over a
trivial matter, which resulted in the
shooting of Stanley. â¢ The negro escaped,
but was captured last night at Camden
by two. white men. They took him to
Burnett's Hotel and wired Sheriff Crow
ley at Richmond to come at once. When
the Sheriff arrived a large crowd of men
from Lexington Junction and Canr'en
were waiting in the street outside the
hotel, and cries of "Bring him out!" and
"Lynch him V were heard, and a general
rush was made on the hotel where the
negro was confined. Some one rired a
gun. Immediately a dozen shots were
fired, and it looked as though a /lumber
of people would be killed, but they
brought him out without accident.
The cry arose "Take him back to the
scene of his crime!" "Burn him on the
pit top!" "Hang him!" and the mob start
ed rapidly for mine No. 4. A halt was
called under a tree near the mine and
the prisoner was given a chance to speak.
He confessed to the killing, but said it
was in self-defense, and he was sorry, and
he asked that his body be I sent to his
mother In Kansas City. He I then asked
Â¦if some one would pray for him. One
man prayed for him: "O God, have
mercy on the soul of this poor doomed
lr.an, and. O God, remember and have
pity on the soul of the man he murdered.*'
A rope was placed around the negro's
neck and thrown over the limb of a tree,
and at 2:23 o'clock^' Smith was launched
into eternity..

WASHINGTON". March 2.â The Senate
in executive, session ,o-day reopened the
discussion connected .with Judge Noyes'
appointment of Alexander McKenzie to
the position of receiver of certain mines
in Alaska. The question arose In connec
tion with the nomination of Frank H.
Richards as United States Marshal for
the Second District of Alaska and was
raised by Senator Stewart. Mr. Richards
had previously been confirmed, but at the
last previous executive session Senator
Stewart had moyed the reconsideration of.
his nomination and to-day's session was
devoted to the consideration of that mo
tion. Senator Stewart led the discussion,
which was devoted almost exclusively to
the McKenzie case. He read affidavits to
show that Richards himself had acted in
the capacity of receiver in litigated min
ing cases under Judge Noyes- appoint
ment, but said that personally he knew
little of the man's character. He ex
prtssed himself as thoroughly distrustful
of Judge Noyes and pleaded with the Sen
ate to permit the nomination to fail, say
ing: that the President could reappolnt
him after nest Mondav and thus afford
time for such an investigation as the Sen
ator thought should be made into the
character of the man v.ho was to occupy
such an Important position as Marshal of
Alaska.
Senator Stewart's attacks upon Judge
Noyes had the effect of bringing out re
plies from Senators Hansbrough, Spooner,
Pettigrew. Turner and others. The do
bate was very tart at times, but the
points developed were In ho wise different
from those made after the same question
came up in the executive session of tli?
Senate a few days ago. Senator Spooner
discussed the appointment of Judge Noyes
at length and Â¦went Quite thoroughly into
his judicial acts. Senator Pettlgrew sug
gested that there was as much reason for
investigating the San Francisco court,
which has Interfered In the McKenzie
case, as there -was fur investigating the
Noyes transactions.

YOU have chronic catarrh, have you?
You have had it some time? And
could not find a cure? Well, there
are thousands more like you In this coun-
try. If the slightest vestige of the catarrh
remains over from the warmer season it
will make itself felt now. If y.ou want to
really get cured do as the following peo-
ple did:
Chronic Catarrh.
S. T. Nance of Robeson Fork, Tenn.,
writes as follows:
"I will state that I am entirely well of
that dreadful disease catarrh. I was af-
flicted with it for fifteen years and it wafÂ»
a very aggravated case for the last five
years. No one can possibly realize the
value of Peruna until he tries It for him-
self. It will certainly cure the worst caso
of chronic catarrh. I had as bad a case
as I ever saw. I have taken seven bottles
of Peruna and every one was worth $100
to me. I haven't the language to express
my gratefulness to you for your kindness
to me and the Interest you have taken In
my case." â S. I. Nance. .
Some cases take longer than others.
Perhaps the average length of time It
takes to cure a genuine ca*e of catarrh is
three months. Some get cured much soon-
er than this. Stubborn cases may require
longer treatment. Time or trouble ought
to be no barrier to one afflicted with this
dreadful disease.

inent Chicago gentlemen:

letter:
"As an article of real merit I gladly
Indorse Peruna. I have used it several
times In the past five years and found it
a first class tonic, a fine medicine to stop
coughing, and especially valuable in cases
of winter catarrh, from which almost ev-
ery man In Chicago suffers more or less.
"If every one knew the value of Pe-

would be without it, especially during the

CATABBH SYMPTOMS.
As Described by Dr. Hartman in a
Becent Lecture.
The symptoms vary according to the
place where the catarrh is located; Ca-
tarrh in the head â nose Btopped up, pain
In ; forehead, scabs In nose, bad breath
snoring,' sneezing, watery eyes; catarrh
of the throatâ voice husky or hoarse, tick-
ling in the throat, hawking, spitting, sore
throat anfl enlarged tonsils; catarrh of
the bronchial tubes â cough, pain In cheat.
This form of catarrh will soon end in con-
sumption if not cured.
Dr. Hartman used Peruna in. over thirty
thousand- cases before it was introduced
to the general public as a catarrh remedy.
Peruna as a remedy for coughs, colda,
acute or chronic catarrh,- has become
known all over the civilized portions of
North America. " Â¦
The reasons for which Peruna haa taken
the lead of all other catarrh remedies afe:
First, it never fails to cure when j>rop-
erly used; second, it permanently . cures

opposition on the floor of the Assembly
may be avoided. Â¦ .
Though the committee Is anxious to
avoid controversy that may keep the bill
from pa5sage it is evident that a fight
will be made, and when the subject is
once opened numerous amendments and
bitter contests may be expected. The
primary election bill is the one measure
most likely to prolong the session.
Johnson, Treadwell and Alden Anderson
have strong objections to the committee
bill. Anderson is friendly to it in the
main and will seek to have his amend
ments accepted by the Committee on
Elections. Johnson. and Treadwell are In
a somewhat belligerent mood and will
fight for their own particular measures
as against the committee bill.

committee bill (Assembly bill "S3) and a
measure of his own (Assembly bill 109)
be made a special order for Monday at
7:30 p. m.. and he explained the commit

objected and insisted that all the primary

MENTO. March 2.â The substitute bill
framed by the Ways and Means Commit
tee to take the place' of the Sempervirens
Club bill; making an appropriation of
$250,000 for the creation of redwood parks,
has a hard fight ahead of It In the Assem
bly. The bill Is the result of the move
ment- to preserve the Big Basin forest in
Santa Cruz County.
Ralston, although a member of tha
Ways and Means Committee, which sen:
in the substitute bill, is the leader of ti-.o
right against the proposition. He has pot
together a band of objectors, seven In
number, and they will file a protest if
an attempt be made to put the bill on the
special urgency file. Under the rules such
action will keep the- bill off that file and
possibly will keep it from reaching final
cpnside'ration before adjournment.
Ralston's coadjutors are Savage, Has
een. Broughton. Henry, Treadwell and
Bliss. Though sentiment in the Assembly
Is strongly In favor of the bill the action
of these men Is likely to defeat the meas
ure.
Schleslnger sought this morning to have
Assembly bill 873, the committee substi
tute, advanced on the second reading fil*
to the place occupied by the original bill.
Ralston misunderstood the request and,
believing it involved the question of th^
special- urgency tile, announced that ha
and six others were ready to ttle a" pro
test.
The chief objection offered by the op
ponents of. the bill is that the owners of
the forest of the Big Basin are rich men,
who ought to give it to the State. Tho
6upporters of the measure answer that
the rich men are not so disposed and that
the provisions of the bill form the onlv
means by which this magnificent forest
can be preserved from destruction.
The bill was reached on file this after
noon and was given second reading and in
committee of the whole was recommended
for passage. n

carried to San Francisco, a distance of
forty miles.
Mr. Qullty says that the purchasers
have a contract with a San Francisco
light and power company for all the'elec
tricity they can use. but he declines to
name the concern. Qullty has been accu
mulating these rights for eight years and
has Invested In them about $30,000. Th3
water is owned by the Spring Valley Wa

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MEN'TO. March 2.â There were rows In
both houses to-day over -the question of
same laws â in the Senate on Currier's
measure to provide for the appointment
of a game commissioner and in the As
sembly on the measure submitted by the
Fish and Game Committee to limit the
number of birds killed and, to prohibit the
sale of game.
In the Senate Smith of Kern opposed
the Currier bill, which, he declared, was
an Infamous measure. He declared him
self as opposed to any measure which
would restrict the billing of game to cer
tain classes, and he said the bill under
discussion had such object in view; that
the office of Game Commissioner .would
be solely for the benefit of men owning
or belonging to clubs which owned pre
serves. Rowell spoke against the bill,
and Belshaw, Currier, Selvage, ShOri
rldge, Davis and Sims favored It. It was
finally passed.
The Assembly bill discussed this after
noon was up on second reading. Several
amendments came in from various mem
bers, only one of which was adopted. Urn
successful amendment strikes out those
clauses which prohibit the sale of gaiae
to restaurant or hotel men or market
men.
Schleslnger made a desperate effort to
have the enacting clause stricken cut, but
his amendment to that effect was los r .
Fellz tried to have the bill amended so
as to forbid any man owning land an 1
prohibiting others from hunting upon ii
to hunt there himself, but his amendment
was lost. Then the bill went to thinl
reading.

"Crglng cor
the Moon"
Has become a pro-
verbial phrase to ex-
press the futility of
mere desire. There
are a great many peo-
pie who think it is .as
useless to hope tor health as to cry for the
moon. They have tried many 1 medicines
and many doctors, but all in vain.
A great many hopeless men and women
have been cured by the use of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery ; people with
obstinate coughs, bleeding: lungs, night-
Â¦weats-and other symptoms of disease'
which if neglected or unskillfully treated
Â£nd a fatal. termination in consumption.
"Golden Medical discovery" has a won-
derful healing po^er. It increases the
Â¦utrition of the body, and so gives strength
to throw off disease. It cleanses the blood
from poisonous impurities and enriches it
with the red corpuscles of health. It is
not a stimulant, but a strength giving medi-
cine. It contains no alcohol, neither opium,
Cocaine, nor any other narcotic.
Sometimes the extra profit paid by
inferior medicines tempts the dealer to
offer a substitute as "just as good" as "Dis-
covery." If you are convinced that "Dis-
covery" will "cure you accept nothing else.
Â«I was in poor health when I commenced
taking Dr. Pierce's medicine," writes Mr, Elmer
Lawkr, of Vol^a. Jefferson Co,, Indiana. "I

Kilmer & Co., Bingrhamtori. X. â¢ T. " â¢ :
It used to be considered that only urin-
ary and bladder troubles Were to "bÂ«
traced to the kidneys, but now modern
science proves that nearly all diseases
have their beginning In the disorder of
these most important organs. .
The kidneys filter and purify the blood;
that is their work. . . â¢
Therefore when your kidneys are weak
or out of order you can understand how
quickly your entire body- is affected, and
how every organ seems to fail id do Its
duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly" begin
taking the famous- new discovery, Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root. . because as . soon
as your kidneys are -well they -will help
all the other organs to health. " A trial
will convince anyone.'
Weak and unhealthy kidneys are re-
sponsible for more sickness and- suffering
than any other di?ea.se, and if permitted
to continue fatal results are sure to fol-
low. Kidney trouble Irritates' the nerves,
makes you dizzy, restless, sleepless and
irritable: makes you .paÂ«Â« . -water often
during the day, and obliges you to get
up many times during the night; causea
puffy or dark circles under the eyes,
rheumatism, gravel, catarrh of the blad-
der, pain or dull ache in the back, joint*
and muscles, makes your head ache and
back ache, causes Indigestion, stomach
and liver trouble: you get a sallow, yel-
low complexion; makes you' feel as
though you had heart trouble: you may
have plenty of ambition but no strength;
get weak and waste away.
The cure for the?e troubles Is Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root, the . world-fainou*
kidney remedy. In taking Swamp-Root
you afford natural help to nature, for
S^ramp-Root Is the most perfect healer
and gentle aid to the kidneys that la
known to medfeal science.
If there is any doubt in your mind 'a*
to your condition take from j your urine
on rising about four ounces, place It In
a glass or bottle and let It Â«tand twenty-
four hour*. If on examination it is milky
or cloudy, if .there Is a rtrick-rJuÂ«t settling
or if small 'particles float about In Its
your kidneys are in need of Immediate
attention.
Swamp-Rcot i" pleasant to tak-e and is
used in the leadlncr hospital*, recom-
mendf>d by phystcians In their private
practice and Is taken by doctors them-
Felves who have Vldney ailments, "because
they recopnlre In it -the preatest and

Sums by Representing Himself
to Bo tha Senator.
WASHINGTON, March 2.â Senator Cul
berson of Texas has been very much an
noyed by the actions of a man who is
traveling about the country and borrow
ing money upon the representation that
ho in either the Senator himself or the
Senator's brother. Letters have been re
ceived from various places in the State of
New York and from Chicago and Louis
ville representing that recent caHs have
been made upon prominent people by- the
individual in question. He frequently se
loots for his victims ex-members of th;
House of Representatives who knew the
Senator's father there, and appears to
have no difficulty in securing fair-sized
sums from them. Senator Culberson says
that he has only one brother, Robert L T .
Culberson, who resides in San Antonio,
Texas, and that he (the Senator) has not
b ren traveling recently. He asks that
friend? of his advance no money to others
on his account.

/ / ; Places.
CHICAGO, March 2.â Judge Elbridge
Hanecy of the Circuit Court of Cook
County was ilaceQ in nomination for
Mayor of Chicago by the Republican
City Convention to-day. The nomination
was not made until the fourth ballot and
followed one of the most stubborn con
tests ever held In a local convention. On
that ballot Judge Hanecy received 485
ballots, or fifteen more than necessary
to nominate. Although there were sev
eral candidates, the fight for the nomina
tion was practically a three-cornered one
between the machine Republicans, sup
porting Judge Hanecy, and the anti-ma
chine and Independent Republicans, 'sup
porting John M. Harlan, and the German
Ktpulilicans, whose candidate was Wil
liam Uoldenvveclc, former president of tha
Beard of Drainage Commissioners.
Nominations for other offices resulted
as follows: " City Treasurer, Adolph
Gartz; City Clerk, Thomas O'Shagnessy;
City Attorney, Oscar Hebel.
2JEW EXTBADITION TREATY
â¢WITH SWITZERLAND
Countries Have Been Getting Along
Very Unsatisfactorily Under
General Provisions.
WASHINGTON. March 2.â The PreM
rir-nt has issued a proclamation putting in
{Â¦ rce a new rxiradltion treatv between
the United States and Switzerland. Up to
this point the two countries have be;?n
petting along in an unsatisfactory man
ner as to extradition matters, under some
very general provisions contained in two
or "three sections of the old treaty of
amity and commerce, and It has boon
deemed better to modernize the arrange
ment. The new treaty Is of the usur.l
type, and where citizens are concerned a.
country is allowed its discretion in deliv
ering up its own.
WASHINGTON, March 2.â The last 3f
the big supply bills of the Governmentâ
the general deficiency measure-^-wa*
passed by the Senate to-day, thus clearing
the deck for final . adjournment of Con
gress. The Indications, are now that the
Senate will do little more than consider
conference reports dur'ng the remainder
of the session. Under the legislative day
of Saturday a session will be held to
morrow, beginning at 3 p. m. In addition
to the general deficiency bill the measure
increasing the cost of public buildings
in thirty-two States, known as the omni
bus House bill, was passed. The bill in
creases the aggregate more than
$2,0tX>.000.
In the course of the day's session Ctay
of Georgia delivered a prepared speech
In favor of the construction by this Gov
ernment of the Nicarazua canal.
At tho night session Chandler called up
the resolution heretofore oftered by him
self declaring that William A. Clark of
Montana had not been duly elected to the
Senate and was preparing to speak upon
it when Allen cuggericed the absence of a
quorum. Twenty minutes was required
to secure the attendance of a majority of
the members of the Senate.
Objects to Criticism.
Chandler' offered a substitute for the
original resolution reciting Clam's former
retirement from the Senate.
In his speech Chandler quoted from an
address made by Clark in Montana las l
January, in which Chandler was criticized
in connection with the Senate investiga
tion of Clark's former election. Chandler
being the chairman ol the Committee on
Privileges and Elections, by which the
motion was made.
Chandler declared he had done nothing
to warrant Clark's cri'.iclsm and he quot
ed the report made by himself and also
by the minority of the committee to sub
stantiate this statement. He declare!
that Clark's vacation of his seat was a
virtual confession of the justice of tho
decision of the committee. f If, he said,
Clark had been innocent he would have
remained for the Senate's continued in-
OJJiry.
"liis fight fixed a stigma of criminality
on Clark which can never be blotted out,"
Chandler said.
Clark's Expenses.
Chandler declared that Clark had spent
$1,000,000 in his last election, but said he
had. followed the plan of corrupting
voters before the November election
rather than to wait for the meeting of
the Legislature to spend his money. Ho
said the facts could be ascertained if the
Senate desired to make an investigation.
He charged a gross, deliberate and willful
violation of the Montana statute provid
ing that returns should be made of cam
paign expenses. To his mind the infer
ence was clear that Clark. had secured his
election by corrupt practices, and itwouM
be astonishing if a man could be admitted
to a seat in the Senate when he had once
been convicted of bribery.
Chandler submitted a statement giving
in detail his estimate of the expenditures
made by Clark in his various Vampaigns.
placing the ag-gregate llgurc at $2,069,850.
Pettus of Alabama briefly replied to
Chandler's speech, saying that it was un
timely.
"If," he paid, "a man Injures another it
causes him to hate that man, for every
time he sees that man he feels mean and
charges tho feeling to the man he has
wronged. It is a terrible picture we have
had hero to-night; let us turn away from
it and pass on." â¢ !
Responding to this sally Chandler said
he had simply joined with Pettus in a
verdict that Clark should not be given* a
Â»>at in the Senate because he had been
guilty of bribery.
Jones of Arkansas presented the cre
dentials of Senator W. A. Clark, which
were received and placed on .file.
Jones then read his motion to take up
for consideration his resolution to dis
charge the Committee on Judiciary from
further consideration of the' anti-trusi
bill. The motion was lost. 24 to 35.
Pettigrew moved that the Senate pro
ceed to the consideration of the bill re
quiring railroad companies to report ac
cidents on their lines to the Interstate
Commeroo Commission. The motion prfi
vailed, but the conclusion of tho consid
eration of the bill had not been reached
when the hour of 10:30. the time fixed
for taking: Â«Â¦ recess, arrived. The Senate
therefore took a recess until 3 o'clock to
morrow.
Chandler Declares That
Clark of Montana Was'
Not Duly Elected.
Submits a Statement Giving in De
tail the Expenses of the Mon
tanan During His Vari
ous Campaigns.

Bills were passed to amend the act es
tablishing a civil, government in AlasK'a
and for the reward of enlisted men of th<Â»
navy, and marine corps. Southard of Ohio,
chairman of the Coinage," Weigths and
Measures Committee, then secured the
passage, under suspension of the rules, of
the bill to create a national standardizing
bureau. . . â¢ â¢ -
The bill was defeated by 117 to 79, two
thirds not having voted in the affirmative.
It was 11:10 when the roll call was com
pleted and the result was announced. As
the regular hour for meeting had already
passed, the House- could not adjourn, so
the legislative day of Friday continued.
As the House will n.ot adjourn again until
sine die adjournement flt noon on Mon

House proceedings.
Mercer of Nebraska, chairman of the
Committee on Public Buildings, was rec
ognized and moved the passage under sus
pension of the rules of the "omnibus pub
lic building bill."
The bill was passed.-
Rewards for Enlisted Men.
Bailey declared that the men. behind the
pending bill were not entirely sincere in
trying to protect savages from the bane
ful influences of intoxicating liquors.
Why were not the Philippines and the
'Hawaiian Islands included? . He under
stood that since the. American regime be
gan there over 1000 saloons had sprung up
in Manila. In Hawaii, "where saloons were
unknown, "until we benevolently assimi
lated them," there were now over 400 sa
loons. Bailey contended that .offenders
under the bill could not be punished.
They could not be tried in any Federal
court in America, in spite of the fiction in
the bill that such offenses should be con
sidered to have been committed on the
high seas.
Uillett of Massachusetts in reply to
Bailey's suggestion regarding the lega^;
phrase of the bill said that the "fiction"
was copied from law applying to the
guano islands which had been sustained
by the Supreme Court.
Bailey demanded a second "and then
brought matters to a complete standstill
oy making the point of no.quorum. A call
of the House was ordered and the ser
geant at arms was instructed to bring in
absentees. It was 10:20 before ' enough
members were brought in to make up the
quorum. Sperry then proceeded to explain
that the bill was designed to prevent the
sale by Americans of firearms and intoxi
cants to the aborigines of the New Heb
rides.
The Speaker then recognized Sperry of
Connecticut to move the passage -under
suspension of the rules of the Senate bill
to prohibit the sale of firearms, opium and
intoxicating liquors in certain islands of
the Pacific. â¢
Bailey of Texas objected to action upon
all bills by unanimous Consent. He was
appealed to on all sides not to block pro
ceedings, but he refused to yield. The
Speaker had refused him recognition a"nd
he was obdurate. â¢ .
Obstruction Attempted.

GIRL MURDERED
ON BUSY STREET
PARIS, March 2.â ThÂ« speech. of M. De
roulcde at San Sebastian, accusing the
Royalists of betraying- his attempted coup
on the occasion of the funeral of the late
President Faure, in 1899, has aroused the
keenest Interest, which Is heightened by
thÂ© emphatic denial of M.. Andre Buffel,
the agent of the Duke of Orleans. The
affair took a still more Interesting turn
to-day, as M. Deroulede's political inti
mate, M. Galli, received a telegram from
him maintaining all he said at San Sebas
tian and reiterating that some one came
lo him during the night of February 22,
1S03, and asked him what he would do if
the Duke of Orleans appeared among hlÂ»
friends. M. Deroulede says he replied
that he would arrest' him with his own
hands. On^ the following day Derou
lede'ft' concerted ' preparations were over
thrown.
"1 know," continued M. Deroulede.
,"that It was the P.oyallsts Mho informed
on my uncompromising repuhileanlfm
and wrecked my attempt."
He concludes with charging . M. Gall!
and another intimate friend, III. duMon
tellift to see M. Buffel and arrange a duel.
M. Paiffelf since hl3 condemnation by! the
Hlgtt Court, has open living in Brussels.

London papers that the Salt Union of
Great Britain will possibly 'be able at a

BERI>TN r , March 2.â The latest phase Of
the China agitation, the projected com
mercial treaties, including the extraor
dinarily hostile tone of the Russian In
spired press en the subject, the Rusao-
Arr^erican' tariff dispute and the Anglo-
German relations, held public attention'
this week. A considerable portion of the
German press etrongiy disapproves of
Germany's protesting against the Russian
annexation of "Manchmla, claiming: that
Germany has no interests there and' that
she is pledged to Russia not to interfere
with anything Russia chooses to do. Tho
Jlngro and Agrarian papers are particularly
outspoken in this respect. The Deutsche
Tages Zeitung to-day says that Count von
Bulow*l proceedings on the subject aÂ«j
Illogical and stupid and amount to hauling
chestnuts out of the fire for Great Britain.
The more sober portion of the press de
plores this new trouble, which creates dip
lomatic antagonism Mkely to split the
whole entente of the powers.
The National Zeitung believes this new
est phase of the China situation to be tha
most dangerous for Â«.he peace of the
world that has come about since the be
ginning of the Chinese trouble.
Unbroken Chain of Blunders.
' . The Vorwaerts to-dav . reviews Ger
many's Chinese policy since the Chino-
Japanese war and declares It to be one
u:u>roken chain of blunders. Ihe paper
adds:
"If the triumvirate of Great Britain.
Germany and Japan had stood their
pround from the tirst it would have been
able, to check Russia's land-grabbing in
solence, but now it is too late: Russia
had what Ehe wanted and is sure of Chi
na's, ratification. Protests from the other
powers are now useless." '
Agitation over-, the new tariff and the
r.ew commercial treaties Is as lively as
ever. The Agrarian demands, after grow
ing: with the apparent indifference of
Count von Bulo'w and the Bundesrath,
seem now to have become more modest
since the Russian papers, at the instiga
tion of M. de Witte. Minister of Finance,
came out with the series of articlej
against Germany's proposed large in
crease of agricultural duties and threat
ening severe reprisals against the impor
tation of German industrial products.
Some of the most Important German
papers have this week printed St. Peteis
burg correspondence explaining that since
Russian industry In spite of Its elaborate
pampering by Minister de Witte, is now
â¢plainly- shown to be a total failure, Rus
sia is all the more constrained to retail
those countries to which she can export
tier agricultural products, hence M. de
. Witte' s fierce attack en Count von Bu
lowl Â¦
An inspired Russian article printed this
week, wherein it is plainly set forth th;?t
if Germany persists in shutting out Rus
sian products. Russia will retaliate not
only economically but also politically, has
been generally commented upon here. A
public address this week by Dr. von Sie
mens, a member of the Reichstag and a
dirpctor of the Deutsche Bank, has also
created a sensation. Dr. von Siemans
paid that if the new treaties are not con
stituted Germany will enter upon a period
of unparalleled distress: that emigration
of from seven to ten millions must be ex
pected and Germany would sink back Into
tthe shadows of provincial existence.
Anglo-German Relations.
Anglo-German relations are slowly im
provine". A number of the more serious
newspaper? confess t':e folly of repellin;?
Olreat Britain's advances. The authorised
news that the alleged disfiguring of thu
Kmperor'3 picture by his British re^i-"
merit <the First Royal Dragoons) In Jan
uarv. l^M, is a myth has done its share
to allay (jerman rancor against the
Britons
The larpest portion of this week"s
Reichstag's pitting uai taken up by a de
bate on dueling, in which Centrist orators
were especially forcible intheir arguments.
They did not even hesitate to attack th<?
Emperor for encourapin? dueling by reg
ularly pardoning duelists after a short
and mil<! confinement. Tne Vorwaerts to
dav publishes another lis=t of such recent
pardons. General von Gossler, the War
Minister, weakly and unskillfully defended
dueling as a custom, but was not able to
disprove the powerful arraignment ".if
facts and reasons by the Centrists.
The unauthentlc news published In the
German papers to tlio effect that United
States Emba.Â«sador White trill retire has
broupht forth strong disapproval from the
American residents Ji\ different parts of
Germany. Petitions arc* ppoken of asking
President McKlnley to retain Mr. White.

DISCARDED.,
The Old Methods of Treating Piles
and Rectal Diseases Supplanted
by the Pyramid Pile Cure.
The eld methods of treating piles by
l!ga.Tur<*. by the knife cr by the cruel
methods of dilatation, besides causing to-
ter.stÂ»: rain and frequently coliapse andJ
tUath. are now known to foe but mere ]
ciaLf shifts as lar as a cure Â»s concerned.
The iiver Is respQiisiblo for nearly every
case of piles, and tlÂ»e mistake has becn j
tr.adÂ« of treating piles as a purely local Â¦
disease. Such Is not the case, however, j
and the success Â©f the- new' treatment j
known as the Pyramid Pil*Â» Cure has dem-
enstrated it. .'. .-- |"
The Pyramid Pile Cure is not a salve ori
oir.iCKT.i. but a suppository Â¦which is ap-'i
V'i'-fA at-nUshf and absorb^ into the sen-:
BltlVC r^ctai membrane and acts both as â¢.
a local ar.d a constlttitioiial treatment, i
**.nd in cases cf many years' standing this j
irratm^m has l>ee:i eflTÂ»*ctua!. Â¦
'i"hov:sar-Q= of rile sufferers, bear witness \
to the Inestimable â¢' value of the Pyramid |
and even these who have ur.dercoiie sursi- ;
cal orÂ«?rations without a cure have ' been :
happily surpr.ipod by results from a few I
v>cks' trfatrrvnt with ;he> l*j - ramh3.
The relief ,--:fnt.m ' pain is so immediate i
that patients somcurr.es imagine that th6 i
Pyrainid contains .opiates or cocaine be- i
cause the relief is fo Instantaneous, but '
the Pyramid Pile Cure is guaranteed ab- . I
Â¦acutely free from any opiate or mineral '
pclecn whatever.- . Â¦;Â¦ ' . : -Â¦Â¦"'". I
The relief is the result of the astringent <
properties of the remedy which causes thV
little tumors and congested blood vessels"
to contract and a normal circulation Is \
established. Â¦*..-Â¦ â¢ â¢
TbÂ« Pjramid Pile Cure is strictly ecten- j
tiSc both in its composition and in its
therapeutic action, and the best feature
of It is that it is perfectly safe ar.d barm-
less. No ill effects ever result from its
i:se. but only positive benefit. . .*â¢ . ;
A sincTiiar fact. In view of the largre
number of patent medicines before the
public. Is that the Pyramid is the only
X''-lÂ« cure of national reputation. It is the
only pile cure popular enough and meri-
torious enough to be found In every drug
eiore In the United States. It sells at M>..
cer.tÂ» for & full sized packape. ' -' Â¦ Â¦â¢

precedent In the matter of prict. The pro
grammes are high class, varied and given
by good local artists, to whom the concerc
series will afford a valued opportunity.
The Metropolitan Temple is central and
large enough to.make the enterprise finan
cially profitable, even at smaller prices
than the Twentieth' Century Club has set
for the series.
There is room here for the weekly pop
ular concerts, as given In many "large

concerts â affectionately christened "pops"
âadmission may be had at from 10 to 50
cents a head, and thousands of wocking
folk look forward to them as the one
j bright spot In their drab, laborious week.

alarm clock holds its cruel hand. Kvery
one almost can afford the 10 cents, and
for 50 cents the musical philanthropist

his poor brethren and at the same time
that of enjoying the almost invariably

this kind of thing, ideally situated and

Pasquale." "Pagliacci" and "Lucia" for
programmeâ all of which hath a more or
less familiar 6ound in one's ear. Though
doubtless Sembrich"s Lucia Is an incom
parable effort, and her Rosina without
question the greatest cf the day, yet
â¢would it not be well for this great artist
to give us something less well-known,
either old enough to be new or of the
Sever operatic classics? Such would in
deed be welcome. Why not "Manon Les

dora." rone of which have been yet heard
here? Why not "La Gloconda," "La Bo
l.en;f," Goldmark's "Queen of Sheba." of
the newer favorites? Why not one of the
rarely heard Mozart or IJelllnl operas, or
Sleyerbeer, or Weber, or Eoito? We
should be bo grateful for any departure
from the regular repertoire. And speak

ON Monday, March IS, will be
gin the fourth and presum
ably the last seasoa of grand
op*>ra in. San Francisco for
. Â¦ -1300-1901. The Tlvoli. with the
best grand opera programme it has ever
had. ret the ball rolling in August last
end ended a stxteen-week season with
Sa'.assa In "Othello," and the. new Car
men, ';Â¦ Collamarlni. singing to houses
crowded to their utmost capacity. Short
ly lifter, the Tivoll's triumphant opening,
nfter mishaps innumerable, came the
Grnr.d Italian Opera Company of Azzallâ
peace be to his ashes!â to the California
Theater. Here the company sang for the
ehort season of two wrrks. in face of
every artistic and financial difficulty that
unkind fate could devise, and at length
disbanded, leaving the Tlvoli, Fischer's
tnd not a few of the Italian restaurants
1 he richer. Then came the Grau people,
Â¦with their never-to-be-forgotten three
weeks' engagement at the Grand Opera-
Jiouse, and to end thi3 season of all sea
Â¦cr.s comes Sembrich, often ranked as the.
greatest lyric soprano hot living.
In her "Reminiscences of John WHk.en
Booth" (McClures for February), Miss
Clara Morris, taking the position that
great wit to madness often la allied, con
tends that when the wretched man con
sented to perform the horrid deed of
death he was mentally unsound; also that
he was a mero tool In tho hands o!
shrewder villains, who pretended thai
from their number the- assaaain should bo
chosen by lot, but who really arranged
that the lot should fall to Booth. That la
quite possible; far stranger things than
that have happened, the secrets whereof
have gone to the grave with the men
that devised them." "Who shall draw a
line," Miss Morris writes, "and say hem
genius ends and madness begins? TherÂ«
was that touch of strangeness. In Edwin
it was. a profound melancholy; In John it
was an exaggeration of. spiritâ almost a
wildness. There was the natural vanity
of the actor, too, who craves a dramatlo
situation In real life. There was hla pas
sionate love and sympathy for the South.
â why, he was 'easier to play on than a
pipe.' "
A model theatrical criticism is that re
cently published In Life concerning a
New York vaudeville entitled "Th* Girl
ftom Up There. One* of th*
Worst That Ever Came Down." Tha
man who wrote that earned his week's
salary.
"The product (of thÂ» drama) is not ma
terial poods: it deals with sentiments aiM
ldeala; its business is to make us happier
and better men and women; and when It
falls from that high aim and becomes a.
money-making institution it Inevitably
sinks as much lower than a shoe shop a=Â»
it ought to have risen higher. The wors;
ia the corruption of 'the best. Suppose*
that the colleges of the country wero
seized and controlled by men whose main
object was to make money out of them;
what would the effect be upon teachers
and students? The drama will continue
to be, a demoralizing: institution so lon^
as It Is dominated by commercialism. It
is not enough to call the actors up to
higher standards; the remedy lies rather
with the men who own the theaters an>l
employ the 'actors. When these nea
leurn that it is sacrilege to take the scep
ter with which high art ought to ru!a
men'3 thoughts and Imaginations and
turn it into a muck rake, wÂ© may hav.s
some hope for tho purification of tha
drama."
The Dramatic Mirror gives the follow
ing extract from a sermon recently
preached by Dr. Washington Gladden of
Columbus, Ohio. The rood doctor's words

some, theatrical productions that we have,

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
So much for Mansfield â off with nls
head! That wore too good for him! As
for the other four signers of that mem
orable agreement, James A. Herne has
been starved Into silence and James
O'Neillâ who can't play anything but the
rubbishy Monte Cristo â has been other
wise and easily disposed of. â¢ F"rancis
Wilson kept up the flght for a. year and
finally gave in, alleging (with perfect
truthfulness) as his first reason that "the
strongest ally, Mansfield, had fallen by
the wayside." Only one signer has lived
up to that agreement, and that a woman
âMrs. Flske! The four men crook their
knees within the temple of RImmon and
knock their foreheads (or rather have
them knocked) upon the ground: the
woman stands erect and scornful with
out; to her as they pass by men take off
their hats.
Xobody expects poor and obscure actors
vainly to martyrize themselves by knock
ing their brains out against the stone wall
of the syndicate, but one does expect the
first actor of America â that we must con
cede Mr. Mansfield to beâ to make some
kind of a stand against an Institution
which he has declared to be "a menace to
art â an outrage and unbearable." Time
was when Mr. Mansfield expected this
much of himself; that was In onÂ© of his
Dr. Jekyll moods. When In that mood
he entered Into a solemn league and cov
enant- with Francis Wilson, James A.
Herne, James O'Neill and Mrs. Flske "for
the promotion and protection of an Inde
pendent stage in this country." But then
the Mr. Hyde mood came over him and
he, the man who could best afford to
make the fight; he, whom people would
go to see if he played in a booth or in
a barn; he, who is continually prating
about his ideals of art and the uplifting
of the stage; he deliberately broke the
written agreement he had made with his
friends, hoisted the milk-white flag of
surrender under threat of the Quaker
guns of the syndicate, and then, from the
s.nufe retreat of the trust camp, ordered
his man Friday â Palmer â to write to his
former associates as follows: "I think" he
(Mr. Mansfield) regrets that he signed the
agreement and blames me for having per
suaded him to sign it against his own
judgment. At the same time he does not
wish it to be understood that he does not
fully sympathize with you In the unselfish
struggle you have made against monopoly
and he would 'be the last to Jeopardize
the successful Issue of your efforts." Did
ever base inpudtnee and slavish treachery
go further than this?
These are golden words, but they come
with a bad grace from Mr. Mansfield, who
Is now endeavoring to repudiate his prom
ise to pay M. Rostand's royalties and
who, more than any one actor In the
United States, Is responsible for the fail
ure of the Actors' Association to make
head against the theatrical syndicate. It
is not probable, as Mrs. Flske pertinently
points out, that Mr. Carnegie or any other
millionaire will do anything to help the
actors of America until they show signs
of courage enough to help themselves.

DISPATCHES from Washington announce that the inaugural parades and ceremonies will
be conducted this year on a scale of magnificence and with a richness of artistic decoration
never before attempted on such occasions. It is natural that it should be so. The increas
ing wealth and population of the national capital afford at each succeeding inaugural an increased
incentive toward grand display and an increased means of attaining it. Moreover the number of
visitors from, various.parts of the country grows larger with the years, and thus that element of the
parade is also more imposing and more joyous with each new; occasion.
There is another factor in the development of" inaugural parades that must not be over
looked. The American people have become iondof grand spectacles. We are a pageant-loving
people. Almost any appeal for money for such enterprises brings forth large subscriptions. We had
a striking illustration of that fact when preparing, for. the welcome home of the California troops
who had served in the Philippines. Other-instances can be found on all sides! In fact so much
have we grown to delight in. rich pageantry and display that our, old-fashioned county fairs with
their homely simplicity have been almost abandoned in favor of flower and fruit festivals/where the
exhibits of rural .industry are displayeclwith every, accessory- of banners and garlands and bright col
ored festoons that is known to the art of decoration. : "
In all of that there is ! nothing; to regret. The change from the old forms to the new delight'
is not a change from simplicity to ostentation fbut from dullness to artistic joy. We have not be
come extravagant. We have become cultured.'. We have discovered beauty and are trying to re
ahze it by every means in 'our power. The. effects of the change are to be noted in the home's of the
people, in the windows of the shops andin.eyery ;- : other department of life.
The. inauguration of a President affords^Washington a ; chance to provide such spectacles on
a grand scale, and the city is well adapted for. their display.: "We ; may reasonably expect therefore"
that such parades will eventually become noted the world over. What, will be done this vear will
be but an intimation of greater glories to come. .,
A FESTAL INAUGURATION.
But in the midst of our plenty and comfort the civilized' conscience ought to get sore and
sensitive at the thought that ihese distant dead are the victims of the pleasure we take in killing!
The distance is great and the difficulties of enforcing law and compelling respect for the
right of the Eskimo, to live are so many that it is probable t this wicked extermination , will go on
until the tragedy is over, and the northern lights will fall upon a wilderness where man -is no more.
The Treasury Department has been notified that this killing for pleasure of the Arctic ani
mals means the starvation of human beings, and the cruel extermination of every Eskimo settlement
in Northern Alaska. Orders were sent to the Collector at Port Tpwnsend to 'request Arctic cap
tains to discourage such slaughter, but it is doubtful if much attention will be paid to it. "
The press of the country should rouse public opinion against such cruelty to the animals
themselves, many of them being wounded to perish miserably on the ice floes, and' such waste of
the food and other supplies on which human life depends. it is not human life in its most
exalted and refined expression,- but these people of the pole are our belated brothers, lost in the Arc
tic night and arrested on their march toward the lights They are a far\ people, and we do not have to
see them curl up in their stone huts and give up" the life which was as dear to them as 'purs
Nature is not lavish in bestowing animal life upon those far northern lands and waters. Her
resources there are so abridged that all forms of life must keep well within the food supply. So
the walrus and seal- must fish from the waters for the Eskimo and be his prey that he may live.
Though the Greenland Eskimo" has merged his. blood with the white Northmen who col
onized his frozen country, the congeners and descendants of the ancient sons of the ice still live
on the coasts, near the cold waters, where they can capture the walrus with their spears, and the
The Eskimos on the west 'coast of this continent are no more fortunate than their brethren
on Baffins Bay. ...
In the Sunday Call was a story of starvation all'.alorg the Alaskan coast from Norton
Sound to beyond the mouth of the Mackenzie. White men for many years have been visiting
those waters and have wantonly killed the walrus. Thousands of these' animals have been shot , in
situations where the bodies could not be retrieved and where no effort was made to recover them.
Indeed, when the white men shot them it was not for the purpose of making any use of them at alU
but for the mere pleasure of killing. '
But their means of living are being wantonly taken away from them. In the Hudson Bay
region the muskoxen arc being slaughtered and exterminated by bold white adventurers who trav
erse leagues of snow in quest of sport. The walrus of Greenland are being destroyed in the same
way. This elephant of the sea is the leading resource of the Eskimo: Its bones, flesh, fat, skin
and ivory tusks are all of the greatest value in his domestic economy. They furnish food, cloth
ing, implements, shelter and weapons. .As the walrus grows scarce the Eskimos starve and die.
Their poor little villages are depopulated, hut after hut, untifall are gone, and silence is where the
simple people were once busy about their primitive arts.
?
AWAY up between the polar circle and the pole, in the land of snow and ice, where nature
is most forbidding and the struggle for animate existence is most' intense, human beings
live. The Eskimo, the people of the floe and glacier, fin-clad and blubbcr-fed, inhabit that
dreadful and dreary .waste, where winter is the king of the seasons. They have all the arts needful
to utilize the slender means of life in that zone, and none can excel them in skill in the chase, the
fishery, the fabrication of garments or the building of habitations suited to their physical condi
tions. These. children of the aurora borealis are members of nature's social union and have a
THE PLEASURE OF KILLING.
The very argument made against them now, that they are mostly negroes, ignorant and in
capable of self-government, is an argument against annexation. If they are that kind of people we
do not want them as possible citizens and their islands as a potential state of this republic.
. It is to be hoped that Gomez will bring his people to see as he does.
.It is with no satisfaction that one reads in American newspapers that the Cubans are
ignorant, vicious, of a degraded race and unfit for independence, for that is just what Spain said as
her excuse for denying them that freedom, which we solemnly declared was of right theirs. No
matter what they are now â they are the same people whose cause we hallowed to the world as
holy; they are the same whonr we declared were fighting for the cause and deserving of the same
'rights as our own forefathers. They are no worse and no better now than they were in 1898, when
we made their ca.use our cause, and embarked our ship of state upon a stormy and unsounded sea to
go to their rescue.
Read between the lines, however, and the position of Gomez is in logical line with his policy.
He sees plainly that our occupancy will not terminate until the guarantees are given, and that the
longer we remain in possession the less likely is Cuban independence. He doubtless sees also that
the policy of the annexationists is to deny the demands of this country, so as to furnish a pretext
for annexation on the score of its necessity .in protection of our interests. Following his idea, it is
to be expected that he reasons that if all these guarantees are given now they will add to the stability
of the Cuban republican government and to its successful administration until it reaches such an
angle of repose and soundness and order that the guarantees themselves will be lost sight of in the
character of that government and in its ability and disposition to deport itself on the line of the
guarantees as its natural and proper course. From our standpoint the annexation of Cubans unde
sirable. There be those who say, "We have sores and sorrows now in Porto Rico, Hawaii and the
Philippines and one more of the same kind will be only a slight addition to our penance â only one
pea more in the shoeful upon which we are limping-." But. this we do not admit. To openly or
covertly promote any course leading to the annexation of Cuba, in the teeth of our pledge not to
do so, is a very different matter from, anything, we have done in the other cases. We may have
done that which needs excuse and explanation, but ii we take Cuba we will have to blush for it, with
a feeling that no excuse nor explanation can cure.
This is a' perplexing. situation. Gomez was. expected to take just the opposite position. But
the men and combinations relied upon to support the pretensions of the United States are' against
him and oppose this country. Â¦ '. , -â¢â¢â¢
IT WAS expected that if any* friction occurred between the Cuban Constitutional Convention
and the United States it would originate with the party of Gomez. To the surprise of all who are
au courant with island affairs, General Gomez avows himself in favor of the guarantees asked by
the United States, and advises that our occupancy continue until they are granted! ;

A GOOD DEAL OF NONSENSE
About "Blood Purifiers" and "Tonics."
Every drop of blood, every bone, nerve
and tissue in the body can be renewed in
but one way, and that is from wholesome
food properly digested. There Is no other
way and the Idea that a medicine In it-
self can purify the blood or supply new
tissues and strong nerves Is ridiculous ami
on a par with the fol-de-rol that dyspep-
sia or indigestion Is a germ disease or
that other fallacy, that a -weak stomach
which refuses to digest food can be made
to do so by liritating and Inflaming th>*
bowels by pills and cathartics.
Stuart's' Dyspepsia Tablets cure Indiges-
tion, sour stomach, gas and bloating after
meals, because they furnish the digestive
principles which weak stomachs lack, an.l
unless the deficiency of pepsin and dias-
tase Is supplied it Is useless to attempt to
cure stomach trouble by the use of "ton-
ics," "pills" and "cathartics" which havn
absolutely no digestive power, and their
enly effect Is to give a temporary stimu-
lation.
One grain of the active principle in
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will digest 30Â»X>
grains of meat, epgs and similar foods,
and experiments have snown that they
will do this In a glass bottle at proper
temperature, but of course are much more
effective in the stomach.
There is probably no remedy so univer-
sally used as Stuart's Tablets, because It
Is not only the sick and ailing but well
people who use them at every meal to in-
sure perfect digestion and assimilation of
the food.
People who enjoy fair health take
Stuart's Tablets as regularly as they tak3
their meals, because they want to keep,
well. Prevention is always better than
cure, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do
both; they prevent Indigestion and thev
remove It where It Â«>xi3ts. The regular
use of one or two of them after meals
will demonstrate their merit and efficiency
better than any other argument.

A novel proposition. Interesting to min
ing men, has been made the subject of
some discussion in Montana. In. the Mon
tana State Senate a bill has been intro
duced which provides that the State
Board of Land Commissioners may leasÂ©
the mineral lands owned by the State on
a royalty basis. The measure is in three
sections. The first provides for the leas-
Ing of "any State lands upon which build-
Ing stone, coal, coal oil or other valuable
mineral may be found for the purpose of
obtaining therefrom the stone, coal, coal
oil or other valuable mineral for a period
not to exceed five years and conditioned
upon such royalty as the State Board of
Land Commissioners may determine."
The second section authorizes the board
to make all necessary rules and regula
tions to carry the measure into effect.
The third section arranges that it shall
be the duty of either tho State Mine In
spector or the State Land Agent, when
ever so directed, to Inspect any mines
that may be developed by. reason of the
act and- report any failure on the part of
the lessee to carry out the terms of the
lease contract. .The laws of Montana now
permit the Land Commissioners to lease
agricultural and grazing lands, and the
proposition is to put the mining lands on
the same basis.

Some activity is reported in the Yellow

have bonded copper properties. The ex
pectation that the district will soon bene
fit by projected railroads Is partly re
sponsible for the stir.
A correspondent writes that what may
turn out to be valuable copper deposits
have been discovered on the California,
side of the Colorado River, in San Ber

to oil lands are at issue is about to come
before Secretary Hitchcock for a hear

falls on Wednesday of next week. The
company parties directly concerned are

The Santa Barbara Press says:
Two companies, one from Los Angeles and
the other from Santa Barbara, have been
quietly locating oil lands during: the last few
months. Now the surveys are completed and
between them they have over 16,000 acres un

Oil Find Excites Petaluma.
PETALU1IA, March 2.â Workmen ex
cavating: for a fifteen thousand gallon oil
reservoir at the Petaluma electric light
works' struck oil this morning. The strike
caused intense excitement for a time
until an Investigation led to a solution of
the oil find. Six or seven years ago the
plant used crude petroleum for fuel and
built a small reservoir about a hundred
feet distant from the new reservoir. The
oil probably seeped from the old recep
tacle and remained all these years in the
hanl pan in which it was found. The oil
bubbled up from below In considerable
quantity. j
Several mine agents are reported In Sis-,
kiyou County awaiting suitable condi

It was five years ago on the 25th of Feb
ruary that the first smelter at Keswick
was fired. Since then the srcond town In

that attends mining development where it
is based on a good body of ore. The first
kiln of ore has just been roasted at the
Bully Hill smelter. Work on the Bully-
Hill mine has been delayed by the lack of
mining timbers. The town of De la Mai>
is taking shape already. A school dis
trict has been formed and a hotel Is near

Moody Mine to Ee Opened.
Items In the Calaveras County papers
are summed up as follows: The discharge
of dynamite in the San Justin mine, near
Angels, opened up a subterranean river,
which flowed into the mine and filled it.
Several weeks must elapse before opera
tions can be resumed. The old Union
quartz mill near Blnums Is being torn
down and will be removed to the Sugar
Pine mine near Murphys. The directors
of the Llghtner mine have declared a div
idend. A $3000 pocket was taken from the
Bald Mountain mine at Columbia. George
Stickle Jr. and James F. Bennett have
sold property rear the Gold Cliff to the
Utlca Company for $15,000. The Alpine
and Pajaro mines have been bonded by
Mrs. Swank of Mountain Ranch to E. C.
TUgney and others on the sale basis of
$20,000. The mines are near the Starlight
mine and were at one time under the
management of United States Marshal
Frank.
The Treka Journal says the experience
of Mfjor Myers of Fort Jones has proved
that patents can be obtained on old min
ing claims. He has patented a claim of
which a survey was made twenty-one
years ago. It is on the old Shores ledge
in Quartz Valley. There are other mines
in the county in shape to be patented
upon which surveys were made years
ago.

Large Number of Stamps Are Dropping at
Scores of Mills in the Hills.
The oil men continue to pcess the work
of exploitation In many counties. "While
the wet weather has interfered with them
in some localities, notably in sections
where supplies have had to either go over
rough roads or wait for the ground to dry
out somewhat, operations have come to a
pause. Thi3 Is only a temporary Inter
ruption. In communities where there Is
only expectation to base the work upon
the roll of incorporated companies length
ens. The summer will see more derricks
raised In California than would have been
thought possible six months ago, when the
excitement was confined to a few fields.
Now localities are legion.
Considerable progress Is being ma/le
around thÂ» bay. In all the northern coun
ties the excitement Increases. This may
be Judged from a hasty review of the do
ings in several of them. . Sulsun has a new
oil company known as the Rochester,
which will drtll on the Thomas DIckson
place of 800 acres, about eight miles east
from Suisun. The Armljo Oil Company
is about to give a contract for its first
well. The Capell Canson Oil Company
has been Incorporated, the principal place
of business being: Vacavllle. A tract of
4000 acres has been bonded In Tuba Coun
ty by a San Francisco party on the Ne
vada etage road ten miles east of -Marys
ville. The Glenn County Oil Company Is
drilling. There Is excitement in the Sul
phur Creek district In Colusa County. Ex
perts are going into Arbuckle. A new
mineral district was recently formed at
Stonyford. The Antioch Ledger tells of
work being: performed in Contra Costa
County by the Contra Costa Oil and Pe
troleum Company, the Tidewater Syndi
cate, the Clover Leaf, the Harvey-Blades
Oil Company and the General Gleaves
Company, and says that the Byron
Springs Oil Company la about to begin
work. That hasty glance tells the story
of the manner in which the people are
becoming interested In counties near San
Francisco.
In Monterey County the Progressive
Women's Oil Company has secured a tract
of 160 acres near San Ardo. The Star Oil
Company has added 1C0 acres to its hold
ings. The Arroyo Seco Company Is re
ported to be making progress.
The uses for oil as fuel are multiplying.
Perhaps the latest wrinkle has been dis
covered in Santa Clara County, where oil
has been substituted for wood as fuel.
This is given on the authority of the
Santa Clara Journal, which says that the
oil is cheaper than wood, and that the
substitution of the new fuel for the old

"I once had occasioa to analyze these
tablets and found them* to contain no co-
caine nor opiates, but simply a- combina-
tion of harmless antiseptics like Eucalyp-
tal, Gualacol. 'blood root. etc.
"At any rate. I have known of severe ca-
tarrhal headaches which were cured by
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, and catarrhal
deafness, hay fever, asthma and catarrh
of the throat and stomach speedily show
great benefit after a few days' use of
the remedy, and when it Is remembered
how much more convenient a tablet is
than 'inhalers, doucl.es. salves and pow-
ders it ia not surprising that this new
preparation should so rapidly supplant all
other remedies for catarrh." -JN c
"The best and most successful treatment
for any form of catarrh is now admitted
to be by Internal remedies through the
stomach, and the safest and probably the
most efficient is in the taMet form, sold
by druggists as Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
""I have seen many remarkable cures of
catarrh resulting from regular daily use
of these tablets, which seem to act on
the blood and liver, driving the catarrhal
poison out of the system through the nat-
ural channels.
"Nasal catarrh is only one of its mariy
forms; catarrh of the throat, catarrh of
the stomach, bowels, liver and bladder
are very common, but the sufferer usually
thinks It is something else than catarrh
and is treated for the wrong disease.
A physician now retired from practice,
but who still keeps abreast of the times,
in speakicK of the advance made In med-
icine in the last ten years says: "One of
the most obstinate and baffling diseases
i3 the very common trouble, catarrh'.

Judge de Haven Decides That They
Must Be Governed by the
Articles.
United States District Judge dÂ« Haven
yesterday hanled down a decision in the
case of Antonio Ramirez and others
against the Mexican Steamship Company
to recover wages lind $100 damages each.
The admitted facts of th,e case were that
the llbelants sierned articles for a .trip on
the steamship Mexico as able bodied sea
men from San Francisco to Mazatlan and
that they were discharged upon reaching
Mazatlan. The llbelants asserted that
the secretary of the Mexican Consul at
San Francisco, in Yeading the shipping
articles to them before they signed, rep
resented -that the. contract was for the
voyage to Mazatlan and return to San
Francisco. This allegation was disproved.
The decision awards the libelants the
wages due them from this city to Mazat
lan with costs, except In the case of Felix
Galindo, whose wages had been paid al
ready.
A Prosperous and Popular San. Fran-
HEALD'S BUSINESS COLLEGE.
cisco Institution.
Among the institutions identified with
the growth and development of San Fran
cisco Heald's Business College holds a
conspicuous place. Both as a business
enterprise and an educational institution
it has been ever since it3 organization,
nearly forty years ago, extremely popular
and. eminently successful. It is in tho
class of those solid and substantial insti
tutions in which a city takes pride. Citi
zens point to It as one of tho old' reliable
and thoroughly progressive establish
ments, an institution with a definite pur
pose and an unquestioned status.
In connection with commercial educa
tion the name of Heald's Is a household
word on the Pacific Coast and throughout
the country at large. 'In its own Held of
effort it is as widely known as Stanford .
or Berkeley, for it enrolls students from
the four quarters of the globe. In 1899
every county in California but four had
Btudents in Heald's BusinesH College. The
four not represented were Del Norte, Las
sen. Orange and .Ventura. The register
of the college shows that in 1900 students
were enrolled from the following States
and Tarritories outside of California; in
many cases there were several represent
atives from each: Nevada, Iowa, Wash
ington, Oregon, Montana, Colorado, Utah,
Idaho, Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, Penn
sylvania, New Jersey, Vermont, Virginia
and New Mexico. In 1900 students came
directly to the school from Mexico, Can
ada, Japan, the Hawaiian Islands, Yukon,
Territory, Siberia and Central America.
Enrollments were also made from Eng
land and Sweden.
Its large body of alumni constitute a
most formidable promoting force, and the
steady growth of the college can be at
tributed largely to the commending voice
of these thousands of graduates, who
know whereof they. speak.

Yew Chuey and Suey Choy yesterday

that he would get a cook in San Jose to

charging them with the murder. He in

â¢Thomas Frawley, convicted of burglary,
was sentenced to four years in San Quen

The troubles existing between various
labor organizations and the employers of
men have not all been satisfactorily set
tled. The strike of the picture frame
makers is still on at Schussler Bros, and
the teamsters are still at outs with their
employers. The battle made by the re
tall clerks for short hours is not yet won,
and It Is expected that before long the
boycotting of certain merchants will be
brought Into court.
ThoÂ» prospect cf sn early settlement of
the differences existing between the dairy
men and the Milk Wagon Drivers' Union
is favorable. A conference committee has
been appointed from the union to meet a
like committee from the dairymen's x
ecutive committee to make an amicable
settlement of the question of wages and
hours of work.
The Retail Trades Council is the latest
labor organization. The union is com

Johansen still maintains that he did not
exhibit any cruelty in scourging the boy.

hand before applying it to the boy's fin

He Is Made to Pay for French Dinner
for Showing Such Small

Fred V. Bushnell was tried by a Jury of
his peers last night at a downtown res
taurant and sentenced to pay for a dinner
for the jury, which body, unfortunatc.y
for him, was of unusually large propor
tions. He was charjed by John B. Cole
man with attempting to palm off as frogs
on a body of experts Known as the Field
and Tule Club a number of Cordelia
toads, thereby acting in an unsportsman â¢
like manner. An able defense was offered
by L. Titua, but It availed little against
the masterly effort of F. V. Bell, prose
cutor, whose argument was supported oy
the testimony of Harry Kosmer, who
clearly demonstrated that he was an ex
pert on frogs and toads.
The trial was the outcome of a contest
held last Sunday in the Suisun marsiie3
between teams captained by Coleman. and
Bushnell. The captalii3 were cgreed that
the team .making the greatest number of
points, based on the ""dead ones" brought
to the clubhouse, was to be declared th j
winner, and In accordance with this plan
a carefully prepared schedule was handed
out naming the number of points to bj
allowed for various ducks, reptiles an-J
anlmuls.
Coleman prepared a miniature battle oZ
Manila to bring to his team the pleasure
of dining at the expense of Bushnell. Th*
scheme was a brilliant, one as far as noise
and brilliancy were concerned, but a fail
ure as "a "Â¦killer." Colenxan's team, how
ever, succeeded in bringing to camp soraÂ°
snakes and other dead creatures, while
the photographer's forces brought in only

"A telegram^ was received Friday by
Secretary Filcher of the State 'Beard of
Trade from the management of the Pan-
American Exposition . at Buffalo urging
haste in forwarding and Installing goods
from California. The telegram also ex
plained that no work would be permitted
in the Horticulture building, where th<Â»
California representation of products will
stand, after May 1. â¢ . .
The space devoted to California Is all
ready- for the placing of Its wares and
product?. . Secretary Kilcher . has sent
notices to, all parts of the- State to hurry
exhibits .to San Francisco that they may
be forwarded. Every county in thia State
will be represented. There are greater
quantities of exhibits than were, sent to
Paris In the Southern Pacific Company's
collection. The ppace is larger and will
permit of an exhibition on n more compre
hensive scale. California^will have one- |
fourth of all the space in the Horticulture i
buildinp. consisting- of 12,000 square, feel.
Secretary Filcher will start for Buffalo
Immediately .after the annual meeting -of
the State Board of Trade, which w*l!
take place on tho 12th inst.

There Is every reason to believe that
the excursion- to Bakersfield on Saturday
evening next, which the Southern Pacific
announces, will bÂ« an unusually popular
event. The interest In oil and all- that
pertains to oil is little short of intense,
and there is a very general desire: to see
tho. practical side of oil development.
The advantages of this excursion are
more than the half rateâ or but little
moreâ which * is offered. There will be
side trips all through the oil region
planned expressly for this occasion, and
excursionists will remain in their special
cars wherever they , go, because the sleep
ers will be : used for these trips. Then,
again, this is a chance that the business
man- can take advantage of without los
ing his rest or an . hour from his work.
The train will leave. Saturday night and
return early Monday morning. Ten dol
lars for the round trip; sleeper extra.
Make reservations early.

. On the 15th of September, 1839, Hoffman
died and his estate is now being manage I
by G. A. Hill. In view of her claim that
the divorce was obtained by fraud anl
without her having had an opportunity
to defend herself, Caroline Hoffman
claims that at the time of Charles J. HoiT
man's death she was his lawful wife and
ehe holds that she is bntitled to a share of.
his estate. . . 'Â¦Â¦A'--:,
SEATTLE. .March 2.â A Deculfar suit,
arising: from an alleged fraudulent divorc,
was this morning begun by a petition filed
in the office of the County Clerk by Caro
line Hoffman, who asks the court to com
pel G. A. Hill, as executor of the estate
of Charles J. Hoffman, to grant her a
share of the property. Caroline Hoffman
alleges that up to the time of the death of
Charles J. Hoffman she was his lawful
wife, and this in the face of the fact that
In the records of the Superior Court of the
State Is filed a judgment which grantei
to Charles J. Hoffman full and complete
divorce from her. She bases her claim
on the alleged fact that her husband ob
tained this divorce by fraud.
Caroline Hoffman recites that- on the
Zd day of January, 1896, she and Hoffman
were married at Denver, Colo. On the
15th of September, 1S96, the plaintiff sayÂ«,
she with the consent or her husband went
to San Francisco to reside. ' During ths
year 1898 Charles J. Hoffman commenced
an action for divorce against her in tha
courts of King County, whence he ha J
moved. In this action Hoffman claimed
that he did not know the postofflce ad
dress of Caroline Hoffman and as a conse
quence summons was published. It is al
leged that all this time Hoffman not only
knew the address of his wife but wa?
writing to her and that she has letters to
prove the statement. The divorce was
granted bv default.

In Miss Eddo's hand as she fell was
clasped a sealed envelope which contained
her last message to the man who had for
saken her. It declared that she could not
live without him and expressed the hope
that they would meet in the land to come.
The note was signed, "Mrs. P. II. Glas
sell (Rhodo M. Eddo).
ACCUSES A DEAD
MAN OF FRAUD
"I won't," she replied, in a dejected
manner. "I believe Phil is at Dr. Shorb's.
When I passed thereiyesterday the doctor
ran out of the house and told me that ,'f
I did not quit coming by there he would
have me anested for vagrancy."
A few hours afterward the girl ended
her life before the Shorb residence.
"Have you seen anything of Phil?" she
queried eagerly. "I have not seen him for
more than three days. He is hiding from
me. or else they have spirited him away.
He promised to marry me and now he
has gone back on his word, like a coward,
and I can find him nowhere. More than
that, he has left me without a cent."
The man to whom she spoke advised her
to give him up.
Early this afternoon Miss Eddo was still
looking for Glassell. On North Main
street she stopped her buggy and beck
oned to an acquaintance. Her face was
haggard. She looked as if she had been
without sleep for a week.
Friends and relatives brought all their
influence to bear upon Phil Glassell to
cause him to break with the girl. Four
drys ago Glassell left Rhodo at their room
an^ never came back. At first it caused
her no uneasiness, but as his absence be
came prolonged the deserted girl became
frantic. She hired a buggy and patrolled
Â¦the entire city in search of him. She sus
pected that her lover was concealed at
the house of Dr. J. de Barth Shorb- on
Bonnie Brae street, and during the last
three days she was noticed, passing there
a number of times by neighbors.
Rhodo M. Eddo was a beautiful girl a
year ago when Phil H. Glassell made her
acquaintance. She worked in a lodging
house on North Broadway. She was then
scarcely 17 years old. Glassell prevailed
upon her to live with him. James P.
Eddo. the lather of Rhodo, at one time
threatened Glassell with personal violence,
but he could not induce his daughter to
leave Glassell. She believed Glassell would
marry her, and after the death of Andrew
Glassell, the father of the young man, she
repeatedly Informed her friends that she
would soon be Philip's wife.
LOS ANGELES, March 2.â After having
vainly searched for three days for Phil
H. Glassell, the lover who had deserted
her, pretty Rhodo M. Eddo ended her life
with a bullet this afternoon. The tragedy
was enacted in front of the residence of
Dr. J. de Barth Shorb, who, the unfortu
nate girl believed, had used his influence
to cause Glassell to forsake her. Miss

W. M. Taylor, chief clerk In the ofHce
of the Captain of the Port at Manila, has
written a lengthy letter to a friend in
this city, explaining the matters leading
up to the cause of Rice's deportation.
Among other things he says:
As you know, one-sixth part of the pilotage
fees collected by the pilots was turned into
this office and by this office deposited with
thÂ« Treasurer of the public funds. This was
done until last September, when It wu or
<JÂ«.red by the military Governor to be discon
tinued. Xo further collections have been
made. The Civil Commission then returned
to the pilots JSGCO (Mexican), which they de
posited In bank for their average and reserve
lund. as provided for by law.
Begins His Attack.
The attack of Rice on this ornce was ma
licious. He had been working In this office,
having come here begging for a Job. He
worked with Harden, ex-hydrographlc expert.
& man who proved himself to be op
posed to the office and every individual mem
ber of it from the time of his arrival until
the date of his departure. While working with
Hayden he tecame imbued with the same
hatred, ill feeling and dislike toward us -which
Â¦was telt by the former. Finally, finding an
opportunity to connect himself with the Ship
ping Bulletin, he severed his connection with
tUIs office, stating In his letter that his stay
la this office had been both Instructive and
pleasant.
tTpon entering: the editorial chair of the
Bulletin his attacks on the office, or the man
agement of the office and the Captain of the
Port and myself, began. We called him In.
rttemptlng to show him In a pleasant.' decent
way his mistake. He was overbearing, surly
and Insulting and he was forbidden the privi
lege of the officeâ this with the knowledge
of the office pi the military Governor. For a
while, a short while, we had peace. Then
upon a meeting- of the shipowners called by us
to regulate again the tariff of the pilotage
fees for the ensuing five yearsâ the passing
of these fees and their becoming a lawâ nevr
zest was given him to attack, claiming dis
crimination and overcharge*, as you will see
by the editorial in the Bulletin.
As you know, pilotage Is floured always. In
fpeaklng of tons, es grofs tons and not as
net tonnage. â¢ Iilee, In his desire to attack
this office, overlooked this fact, and hence his
long talÂ» of woe The charges collected by
the pilots are In exact conformity with law.
and also In conformity with the custom of
figuring In, vogue during Spanish times. There
has been absolutely no change, except the
charge which took place two years ago when
the rate was doubled. All merchants In Ma
nila, shipowners and consignees were advised
In I83S, when the change was made doubling
these rates. They all signed having received
rotice and raid without murmur until Rice's
agitation.
Ask for Investigation*
On December 14 we asked the military Gov
ernor to Investigate â¢ the charge* brought bv
R!ce and also to investigate Rice. The ln
rr-ector central. Into whose hand* the matter
r.as placeri. . pave Rice a certain number of
days to present his prrtoTe. At the end of
tlie stipulated time Rice was not ready, and
*u stated. He wai asked If he preferred to
put his charges and his proofs in writing, to
which he replied "yes." Jle did Â»o. being
rlvpn about a month to arrange them In
chape. The lnsp-ctcr general then called upon
thoee parties who had br-en quoted by Rice
ar.d whose names he had used as witnesses
or as proofs of his charges, and the result of
the Investigation was that Rice was ordered
deported for making public, malicious, willful
Â¦ n<3 sla-nflerous statements and deliberately
lyin*7 aealnst a branch of the Government,
nralnst an office and against an officer of the
Government.
The writer also intimates his belief
that Klce was not prompted BOlelv bv
pure or patriotic motives in making 1 his
attack on the office of the Captain of the
i ort.
GBEAT TBAINED ANIMAL
SHOW AT PAVILION
Crowd of Juvenile Enthusiasts Ap
plaud Marvelous Tricks of Po
nies, Dogs and Monkeys.
Mechanics' Pavilion presented a happy
scene yesterday afternoon when Xorris &
Rowe's great trained animal show gave
its first performance. Half the Juvenile
population of the city packed the big
building and shouted their delight as the
assortment of dogs, horses, monkeys,
zebras and poats went through a mar
velous entertainment.
The show opened with the introduction
of the entire company of animal actors,
led by a big band and escorted by a num
ber of clowns. One of the most interest
)r.g features on the programme was a
military drill executed by twelve beauti
ful Shetland ponies. The little fellows
went through many Intricate maneuvers,
and the youngsters on the 'bleachers
yolled their delight.
The act of Bosco. a bijr monkey, in slid
ing down a fifty-foot wire, came In for
vociferous approval. Some really mar
velous tricks were performed by Jimmy
Rlaine, said to be the best trained pony
in the world.
The programme of more than twenty
five separate features concluded with the
burning of McGlnty's home. which
brought the animal fire department to
the rescue and set the house wild with
Joy. Norris & Rowe's show will remain
at Mechanics' Pavilion sixteen days.

the ebb tide until twenty-six fathoms of
water was recorded bv the lead. Thon
a complete circle was described back to
the starting point, the diver being down
for twentv minutes. He described a cir
cle over half a mile In diameter, which
covered the very spot where the RIt
ghould be found if she ran on Fort Point
rocks, as Pilot Jordan claims. Not a trace
of the wreck could be found by tho diver
Takahashi was the third diver to go
below. He went down In seventeen fath
oms near the reef where the Rio is sup
posed to have struck and worked his way
seaward until twentv fathoms â¢ were
reached. In twelve minutes he came to
the surface an eighth of a mile from
where he had descended and again was
the report received of nothing found and
dense water.
Explore Various Spots.
At noon the men took lunch, tha
weather being bright and clear, with a
smooth sea. Takahashl again entered the
water in seventeen fathoms at a spot one
eighth of a mile southwest of the red buoy
off Fort Point. This Is the spot where tne
life-saving crew claimed to have located
the wreck a week ago. The diver's report
after being down twelve minutes and
working his way along 1 the reef showed
that the life-savers wore as much In error
In locating the wrecked Rio as Pilot Jor ;
dan Â¦was.
'Again the location was changed, and
Takahashl went down In seventeen fath
oms of water one mile due west of the
Fort Point buoy. After remaining some
time in the strong current ho came, up
and reported nothing in. sight except rocks
and gravel.
White Paint on Anchor.
Yamamoto was the next diver to try and
find the Rio's -.vreck. He was lowered into
the water at a point almost two miles
from Fort Point along Bakers Beach. He
remained below for live minutes and on
coming up reported that the current was
too strong to stand up against. To tho
amazement of tho spectators Yamamoto
asked for a heavy anchor to be tied to his
legs, and with this heavy weight he went
down in the same spot. HÂ» came up In
five minutes and still no trace of the
wreck had been found.
At this spot the heavinsr lead and the
anchor were fouled and It was hoped that
the wreck lay beneath the bobbing launch
and diving barge. When the anchor was
finally released a careful examination
showed tho marks of white paint. Th-j
heavy current sweot the launch and
barge from the snot and it was impossible
to get the diver In exactly the same place
again. After cruising around it was
thought the spot where the anchor caught
had been located and Yamamoto again
went beneath the waters. After eight min
utes he signaled to haul up and he came
to the surface Â¦with no news of the sought
for wreck of the Rio.
Sako, the Ufth diver, then relieved
Yamamoto and went down In the swirl
ing tide. He remained for seven min
utes and reported nothing found. The last
descent was made by Sako one-half mile
due southwest from the Fort Point light.
Sako came up In ten .'minutes and report
ed no sign of the wreck. For fully an
hour before the divers suspended opera
tions the tug Alert, with Pilot Jordan and
some of the Pacific Mail Company's offi
cials on board, watched the Japanese at
work.
At 4:30 p. m. the diving party headed
for home.
Was a Rio Victim, Is in Town.
COMES ON A SAD ERRAND.
Fred J. Matheson, Whose Brother
Fred J. Matheson, a Journalist connect
ed with the New, York Herald, has arrived
THE positive location of the wreck
of the steamship Rio de Janeiro
still remains to be determined,
and Pilot Jordan's claim that he
had marked the spot where the
vessel took her fatal plunge was yester
day proved erroneous. Some of the most
experienced Japanese divers on tills coast
yesterday explored the bottom of the bay
where Jordan claimed the wreck was to
be found, and, as was expected, . not tho
slightest trace of the ship was found
there.
At one time during the afternoon a
small anchor fouled, and when It was re
leased it bore traces of \ white paint. This
was at a spot' fully half a mile southwest
of where Jordan had indicated as the lo
cation of the wreck. Owing to the heavy
current it was Impossible to again place
the barge over tne exact spot where the
anchor nad caught.
A ftw days ago the Japanese Diving
Company, tnrougn its local managers,
made an offer to the I'aclrtc Mail Bteam
snip Company to Jlnd the wreck of the
Kio and tne resting spot of her scores of
victims. The offer was declined and tha
task was given to the Whitelaw Wreck
ing Company.
Whitelaw and Pilot Jordan have thus
far failed to locate the wreck, but yester
day Jordan, accompanied by some of the
Pacific Mail orticiais, watched the Japa
nese divers at work and then proceeded
to take soundings near tho spot where
the divers had descended.
â¢ The offer of the Japanese to locate the
wreck was laughed at by many persons,
and faith was put in American divers, but
those who saw the Japanese divers at
work yesterday wero astounded by the
ease with which they went into twenty
five fathoms of water and the length of
time they remained under the surface,
Remarkable Deep-Sea Diving-.
It is no exaggeration to say that more
remarkable exhibitions of deep sea div
ing have never been seen In any part of
the world. The statement that a diver
could not go down beyond twenty fath
oms of water, owing to the great pres
sure, was* controverted yesterday, when
the Japanese divers went down Into
twenty-tive fathoms and remained there
for twenty minutes.
The divers are In the employ of T. Mori
& Co. of San Francisco and Monterey,
and for many months have been engaged
In diving for abalone at Point I>obos,
Carmel 13ay, Monterey County.
The pride which the Japanese have In
their work is shown by the fact that the
men bore the entire expense of coming
to San FYancisco from Monterey, pur
chasing new diving suits and chartering
a launch and barge. While they were not
able yesterday to lind the wreck of the
Rio, they proved conclusively that the
wreck was nowhere near the spot where
Pilot Jordan declared it to be.
Jordan Located a Bock.
What Pilot Jordan declared to be the
wreck, after making soundings, now
turns out to be an uncharted rock which
Juts upward twenty feet from tho bottom
of the Golden Gate.
Yesterday morning the Japanese divers
and assistants to the number of seven
teen started from Broadway wharf for
the Golden Gate. The Hat-bottomed
barge on which they had piled their ap
paratus was towed out by the launch
Jennie C, and a quick run was made to
Fort Point. A large crowd of spectators
watched the work of tha divers from the
Presidio and Bakers Beach, while the po
lice petrol boat and a number of launches
hovered around the barce.
Five divers worked during the entire
day, the men making a number of de
scents. The men who explored the bot
tom of the bay were Yasoflo, Watanabe,
Takahashl. Yamamoto and Sako. Mr.
Kotanl, the manager of the diving com
pany, superintended the work, and thÂ«
officials of the company, together with
A. M. Allen, a wealthy land owner of
Monterey, who is interested in the work
of tho Japanese, lent valuable assistance.
A Japanese doctor and representatives of
The Call were also present.
The first descent was made>by Yasodo
!n thirteen fathoms of water near the
spot where Pilot Jordan declared the
wreck lay. The diver remained down for
three minutes and came to the surface,
reporting nothing found. After a few
minutes' rest Yasodo went down In sev
enteen fathoms of water, but after three
minutes reported nothing In sight. A
third and fourth attempt was made in
sixteen and eighteen fathoms of water
near the buoys placed by the Mall Com
pany as marking the wreck. The third
descent lasted for five minutes and the
fourth one lasted fifteen minutes. The
diver reported on coming up that he
could see no sign of the wreck and that
the water was very dense. He described
the ocean bed as being smooth and con
sisting of pebbles and gravel.

AT TANFORAN TRACK
By Louis Honig.
THE card at Oakland yesterday
was not a bit "classy ,*' still it at
tracted the usual Saturday con
tingent, and withal furnished
some clever sport. "While three
favorites eloped with purses, three other
ones met with disaster and the books
broke about even with the talent. Again
Johnny Bullman, undoubtedly the most
consistent rider in this country, met with
marked success, placing three horses over
the line In front. Bullman is honest and
conscientious and deserves the well
earned applause he Is the recipient of.
By long, odds the most impressive win
of the matinee was that of Barney
Schreiber's brown imp. Sain colt, Cor
rJsan. In every way a better actor and
more even tempered than his arropant
namesake, the two-year-old took the first
four tmd a half furlong spin of the sea
son like a good one. Picking up Bullman
and ]1S pounds, he raced the favorite,
Rosewar, to a. stands: ill. and then won
under closely reefed sails from Dr.
Scharff in :55V*. Kosewar found the game
fo warm thai she retired altogether the
last eighth, llnishing- last of the quaitet
starting.
In his vastly Improved form, Meehanus,
with only 110 pounds on his back, was
held altogether too cheap by Mr. Brooks
In the six-furlong handicap. He was fa
vorite coupled with Daniel at odtis of 2
to 5, and leadir.fr from the start, finished
nvu lengths In advance of Dollie "Wcitl.off
at the wire, in 1:14. Doublet, the entry of
*T>oc" Sireett, took the show from Mag
pie Davis, none too well ridden by
Monnce,
After meeting with misfortune in two
or three previous races. Nullah, the fast
breaking mare owned by Hughes & El
liott, finally fell Into a soft- spot. She went
to the post a 7 to 10 choice for the Intro
ductory overture at fiva furlongs, winning
in a walk. Gold Baron, the contender
throughout, downed Summer a length for
the place.
A wholesale dump was made by t!Â»^
smart sot over the defeat of St. Rica for
the six-furlong event following. The St.
Andrew three-year-old did look a wic
ninsr candidate, and the 3 to 5 chalked
against him lasted for only a minute.
Ruiz had the leg up, and getting into all
sons of difficulties on the far turn, got up
in time to be hoaten a hf>ad by El Topio,
nicely ridden by F. Kelly. Only a head
further away Marcy finished third.
ritarter Jakp Holtman had twelve at the
post in the third number, a sprint over the
Futurity course, and they gave him a deal
of trouble. Morinpa, piloted by Bullman,
or-rtainly -looked the best, and the gelding
with the corkscrew less won at the clo<=e
frnm Modwena with something to spare.
J. T. Woods got home third on McAlbcrt,
a 30 to 1 shot. Lady Newinn, a beginner,
I displayed considerable speed and later on
may do.
A few days back The Benedict was
beaten in a race when ruling a 2 to 5
chance. There was an excuse for the hap
pening, however, as the track was heavy
and Dominick could not keep the gelding
awav from the rail, where the going waa
deepest. In the fourth chapter, a seven
furlong run, decided under selling condi
tions, the odds against "Doc" Streetfs
horse fell from ft to 4Â»Â£, and he made no
mistakes. K. Matthews soon had him In
the lead, and stalling off the well-meant
challenge of Bullman, on Grand Sachem,
got over the mark first by a couple of
lengths. Ranseh rode a speckled race
astride Rollick, the favorite, finishing
third.

SAN DIEGO, March 2.-Tho San Diego
team put a cinch on the pennant of the
Southern California I^ea&ue to-day by de
feating the San Bernardino team for a
third time in this series. The score was
8 to 5, and tho visitors were only oneÂ©
within reach of a winning:. Mike Donlin
waa on the slab for the home team at tha
beginning of the game and Â¦was in his old
form for just a little while. He got tho
first two men on strikes and two more In
the second inning, but in that he injured
his arm at the elbow and retired to make
Â¦way for Devereaux, who pitched for five
innings. Then, at a general demand from
the well filled grand stand, "Dummy"
Taylor was put in to give, the people a
chance to see their favorite in the box.
Joe McCarthy officiated for the visitors
and showed that he had not lost his cun
ning. The game was short and snappy
enough to suit any crank. The thre'e
doubie plays by the San Bernardino3
were particularly good, and the only
Kelly was In them all. Taylor's beautiful
throw from deep right to the home plate,
shutting cut a run and completing a
double, was also a feature. The score

Named After the Commodore.
The torpedo-boat destroyer was named
after Commodore Edward Preble, who
was born in Portland, Me. He entered the
American navy in 177S; was taken pris
oner in 1779, but was released in time to
render valuable aid against England in
tho Wlnthrop. In 1803 he was sent In the
Miss Preble was presented with a hand
some souvenir of the occasion. It was a
beautifully painted oaken plaque, cov
ered with poppies and a photograph of
the recipient in one corner.
Miss Preble graduated from the Berke
ley High School in the class of 1S9S. She
Is at present a freshman in the University
of California. She is the eldest daughter
of C. S. Preble of 1534 Arch street, North
Berkeley, who Is engaged in the, lumber
business. . â¢
Miss Preble, stunningly gowned, stood,
on the platform awaiting the signal. She
made a pretty picture as she stood poised
to shatter the bottle of wine against the
side of the torpedo-boat. As the-.boat be
gan to slide down the ways she gave the
bottle a determined fling and the Impact,
caused the spaikling liquid to spatter In
every direction. Simultaneously with this
action Miss Preble made her little speech
and then turned to receive the congratu
lations of her friends.
J. O'B. Gunn, a director of the Union
Iron Works, had charge. of the launching.
James Dickie and John Scott superin
tended matters, and it was due to their
presence that not a mishap marred the
ceremony. On the platform were Miss
Ethel Preble, Miss Florence Preble, C. S.
Preble, Miss Hazel Preble, Miss Annie
Preble, W. J. Trott, C. Retsloff. C.

Makes a Pretty Picture.
- The launching of the destroyer was a
perfect success, and the live hundred in
yited guests who watched the boat re
ceive the baptism could not restrain their
bursts of admiration. Tooting whistles
and loud hurrahs made a. fitting accom
paniment to the launching. There was
not a hitch in the programme. The ves
sel started down the ways on the minute
and a few seconds later rode peacefully
on the still waters surrounding the great
shipyard.
The ceremony* was set for 9:20 a. m.,
and when the guests began to arrive
everything was in readiness. A few min
utes before the time set for the launch
ing tho workmen dislodged the blocks on
which the keel rested and painters quick
ly touched up the spots thus exposed.

hardly up to his best form in putting.
The best round made yesterday was
Harry Rawlins' 41, which was beaten only
by Willie Smith's 40 and 39 on Friday.
I>avld Bell made many fine strokes, but
was Inclined to pull his drives. Robert
Johnstone of the San Francisco links tied
with Horace Rav.iins- for best score of
yesterdayâ S6.
Willie Smith played with F. J. Riley.
Horace Rawlins v.lth David Bell, and
Harry Rawlins with Robert Johnstone.
Neurly all the professionals seemed a
little disposed -to putt short, but this is to
be accounted for In the caae of Bell, Smith
and Rlley by the fact that they have^been
playing a good deal on sand greens.

LONDON. March 2.â Lieutenant, the
Marquis of Headfort, of the First Life
Guards, whose determination to make
Miss Rosa Boote of the Gaiety chorus
Marchioness of Headfort has created so
much talk, is under orders to Bail for
South Africa and Is confronted with tha
necessity of going when told and fight
ing or giving up hi? ilancee. He declares
he will accept the stigma of resignation
rather than forego his resolution to
marry. The case has been brought to the
notice of no less a personage than King
Edward, who has handed It over to
Prince Edward of Sixe- Weimar, colonel
of the First Life Guards. The Prince of
Saxe-Welmar wrot's a letter pointing out
to the Marquia the ruin of his career If
he insisted on marrying Miss Boote, as
she could not be received by the regi
on t*nt-
The Marquis replied, regretting that he
could not see it that way, but he sent his
resignation papers to Lord Roberts. The
commander in chief apparently invented
a little plot, for Instead of accepting hi3
resignation he ordered the Marquis to
hold himself in readiness to go to the
Transvaal. The denouement is expected
to be a quiet marriage and the retirement
of the young peer from his Majesty's ser

OTTAWA. Ont., March 2.â The House of
ASSS XIHG TO OMIT
PORTION OF HIS OATH
told John Llclch. the proprietor, that he
would not see him again. He went toward
a private room and remarked that he had
played cards there once with an old
friend the night before he died. He did
not pay for the drink he got, saying he
had no money.
Other friends of the old man say that
he has been despondent for some time
over money mutters. They pay that 4t he
could have got some money he would
have made a fortune out of the plant he
was running.
Herman Cordes was a native of Ger
many, aged 74 years. He amassed a for
tune in this State, but lost It all in specu
lation. He leaves two sons and* a daugh
ter. Herman Cordes Jr. Hose Company
Is named for his deceased son.
The Coroner's lmjuest was held thlp
afternoon at 5 o'clock. The theory of
suicide was further strengthened by tho
testimony of Asa Perkins, who said that
Cordes had told him yesterday. In reply
to a casual remark about his walking up
and down Park street, that he would not
do it many more times. The other wit
nesses were those whose connection with
the matter has already been stated. The
Jury brought In a verdict to the effect
that death was the- result of an explosion,
the cause of which is unknown.

is caved In and the interior is a wreck.
She was awakened by a piece of board,
that was forced through a break in the
wall, striking her on the head. For a mo
ment she was stunned, but as soon as she
recovered she dressed hurriedly and went
to the assistance of the man she heard
groaning outside.
"I live within a hundred yards of the
place." said Mr. Hebard. "and felt the
concussion more than anybody else. At
first I could not locate- tho trouble, but
as I was walking down the street that
skirts the tidal canal I heard the groan
ing and then saw the wreck. I asked
Mr. Cordes how It happened, but he could
not answer."
The amount of powder exploded is not
definitely known. As near as any one
knows it was about 100 sticks. The con*
cussion was terrific for such a compara
tively small quantity, but the theory Is
that pome chemicals that were stored
there went up with the powder. Cordes
used powder to blow up tree stumps. He
bought a box containing 100 sticks two
weeks ago, but only used a few. Thomas
Pellow. a former employe of Cordes,
urged the old man to get rid of It, but
for some reason he did not do so, though
ho promised that he would.
Believe Cordes Committed Suicide.
Cordes had been manufacturing eucal
yptus oil for some time, having extracted
it from eucalyptus leaves. He owned two
buildings, one of which contained a boil
er and two stills and the other his office
and storeroom. It was in this latter that
he kept the giant powder.
He was accustomed to working late.
but always came home. Last night he
did not come home at all and his son and
daughter, with whom he lived at 1216 Post
street, were worried about him. Still they
thought he would be able to take care of
himself.
It is the old man's strange conversation
last night that leads many to believe that
he deliberately committed suicide, though
pome of his friends scout the suggestion.
He came to Alameda from the city on the
10:10 narrow-gauge train and dropped in
at the saloon of P. A. Dean in the Park
Hotel. He played cards with some friends

announcement was made here to-day by

A'LAMEDA. March 2.â Under cir
cumstances which Indicate the
act of a despondent man bent
upon ending his own life, a Quan
tity of giant powder was exploded
at an early hour this morning, tearing
into shreds the body of Herman Cordes,
an aged resident An hour after the ex
plosion the old man expired In the hos
pital ambulance and the destination of
the vehicle wa3 changed to the Morgue.
The city and Its suburbs was shaken
by the terrific concussion a few min
utes after 5 o'clock. Windows half a
mile away trom the seenÂ© of the explosion
were broken. Wild rumors spread about
the streets that a terrible accident had
occurred, with consequent loss of life. In
a short time hundreds of people had be
come spectators of the devastation re
sulting from the explosion.
The scene of the happening was at the
foot of Park street, near the tidal
canal bridge. One building had be,en
leveled to the ground, every 'piece
of timber having been broken Into bits.
Two or three other buildings had their
sides and roofs crushed Inward. A great
hole in the earth showed where the pow
der had done Its work. It was beside this
hole that the body of "Old Man Cordes,"
aÂ« he was familiarly called, was found
writhing in agony.
"Give me a drink of water! Oh, for
God's sake give me a drink of water!"
were the words the wounded man groaned
out to Mrs. Mary Lambert, .the first to
come to his assistance.
Brave Woman Attends Mangled Man.
Mrs. Lambert, herself nearly a victim of
the explosion, tended the old man. though
the sicht of his torn body sickened her.
She administered to him until the ambu
lance came to take him away. She had
seen at once, however, that he had been
fatally hurt. His body was a. mass of
quivering shreds, not a stitch of clothing
being left on it. The left foot was torn
off and thrown some distance. The face
was blackened and unrecognizable.
Just after having been given the water
the old man lapsed into unconsciousness.
The appeals for drink were his last words.
H. E. Hebard, who was second to reach
the spot, attempted to get a statement as
to the cause of the explosion, but he was
unsuccessful.
The home of Mrs. Lambert Is within
twenty feet of the place where the ex
plosion occurred. The rear of her house

Charles Heath, colored, chased the col

family residence at 2526 Hilleffass avenue.
Berkeley, this morning, and falling to
catch her slashed her wardrobe with his
raeor. holding the scandalized proprietor
of the houee at bay with the same trusty

did cot sufSce he would blow the top of
his head off with hla revolver.
Heath la minus an eye, and emphasizes
this affliction a* a basis for shelter In the
Home for the Adult Blind on Telegraph
' avenue, utilizing the good eye In pursu
ing coy damsels and hla calling of oroom
peddler. He called at the Ayau dwelling
this morning and asked to see Fanny
Johnson, the maid of all work. He was
referred to the baÂ£k door, where he found
Fanny and engaged her In conversation.
The young woman related afterward that
her caller wanted her to fly with him and
be his own.
The young woman demurred to so sud
den an elopement, whereupon her ebony
edrairer ardently pressed his suitâ so ard
ently, paid Fanny, that she thought prop
er to retreat. Heath vainly tried to soothe
her alarms with a loaded slx-ehooter, but
Fanny fled, Heath being a close second.
The master of the house, hearing
Charles and Fanny dashing about the
house to an accompaniment of crashing
bric-a-brac, ventured a protest. The
broom peddler turned his attention to
that gentleman and promised to carve
him to the queen's taste If he made him
self tco officious.
Then he went to the girl's room and cut
and tore Into shred* every piece of wear-

BERKELEY. March *.â The university
"co-ed" Is Â¦willing to adopt co-education
In its general features, but when it come*
to some of the masculine details sha
draws a hard, sharp line. The members
have drawn one of these lines at a Co-.
ed Rooters' Club. Collars, ties, shirti
and shoes have been adopted from the
wardrobe of the steener sex- basket ball
was adopted from the football of thÂ«
boys; organization;*â boating, athletic, lit
erary and socialâ were formed. Just like
those of their brothers and other sirla'
brothers ; but whfn It came to a Rooters'
Club, to b^ composed entirely of thÂ©
gentler and generally Imitative sex the
girls balked. They could stand for much
that savored of bratvn.buf when It carae
to brawn of the voral chords it became
too much for even the feminine courag*
of Berkeley. . â¢ " â¢ :
The. plan originated with thÂ«* Associated.
WomÂ»n Students, an organisatior that
has done much to advance th? co-ed in
terest In athletics and orgaptzatlnn. It
was proposed that a fem'ale Rooters'
Club, attached, to the Sports and Pastimes
Association, would be very nice.' and that
the club -might do like the Rooters' CTvÂ«tÂ»
attached to the football. ?e?isonâ cheer thÂ«
hearts of the basket ball team on to vic
tory.as the souls of. the football men are
supposed to be <-"hWred to victory in the
days of- the great intercolles^ate Kame.
So the girls, went to worfc; just as the
boys did last fair. Th*>y selected a yeil
leader in the rersdri of Miss Marguerite
Scott, and Miss Scott, was delegated to
organize her assistants. - . - â¢â¢- ".'Â¦Â¦

Varlcocele is an accumulation of slujr-

Prostate and restores healthy circulation
Varlcocele disappears -and the sluggish

news of the first white marriage In Guam

widow at Port Townsend named Mrs. K

Soon after he started for his island home
to prepare an abiding place for hl3 bride.
December last Mrs. Price left here on tha
traxeport which was taking Father Xlc-
Kinnon back to his labors in the Philip
pines. Such a thing as a marriage license
had never been heard of in Guam, so the
ceremony had to* eo on without one.
Father McKinnon performed the cere
mony In the presence of the entire ship's
crew and passengers. All hands were in
vited ashore to a feast prepared by Mr.
Stimpson In anticipation of the event.

Keith's Grand Opening
filed an action for divorce and on "Febru
ary 23. 1901, the decree was granted. Now
they wish to ag-aiu marry, they aver. but.
contrary to the provisions of section C3 of
the Civil Co<lf>, they have been refused a
license by the County Clerk. In conclu
sion they ask that a decree be issued out
of the court compelling the County Clerk
to toÂ«Ufl the license forthwith.
When Mr. and Mrs. Meinhold applied
for a license the Fame was refused them
on the ground that compliance with their
request would be in violation of section Cl
of the Civil Code, which reads:
A subsequent marriape contracted by any per
son during the life of a' former husband or
wife cf such prTFon. with any perscn other than
such fcrirer husband or wife, is illegal and
void from jhe begrinning, unless:
Th<Â» former marrlaRc has been annulled or
dissolved: provided, that in case lt be dis
solved the decree of divorce must have been
rendered nnJ made at least or.e year prior to
such su'jse^uent marriage.
l"nless such former husband or wife was ab
wnt. and not known to such person to be liv
ing for the spare of five successive years im
mediately preceding such subsequent marriage,
or was generally reputed or believed by eueh
person to be detid. at the time such subse-
In either of which cases the subsequent mar
rlajre ls valid until its nullity is adjudged by a
competent tribunal.
It Is the consensus of. legal opinion that
Sir. and Mre. Meinhold will win their
point.
JESUITS WILL OPEN HI5SI0N TO=DAY
Mr. and Mrs. Meinhold are not trying,
either of them, to contract marriage with
other than "a former husband and wife."
They were former husband and wife and
under this statute, which prohibits the
remarrying- of divorced persons within
one year from the date of the issuance
of the decree, other than the remarriage
of "a former husband and wife." they
claim the right to a license -within this
State. The case has been assigned to
Judge Seawell for hearing. Before goinc
to Nevada to again become husband and
wife Mr. and Mrs. Meinhold will await
the opinion of the court. In the meantime
their baby boy will continue to ask his
mother for "papa."

_ PROFESSOR JOHNS.
The wcrld's greatest living palmist and clair-
voyant, can be consulted daily on all affairs of
life; he advises you whether you will be sue-.
ce?sful. In business, mlnlnu-or lawsuits, etc.;
Professor Johns Is beyond the shadow of a
doubt the roost scientific practicing palmist
an d clairvoyant In the world to-day. -
There Is no home so dreary or sad, no life
so hard and blighted, no heart so sad and
lonely, that cannot be set right and kept right
after a visit to this Inspired prophet or modern
times; all long-standing and chronic diseases
that have baffled the physlcian'B skill cur?d
without the use of medicine; he reunites the
separated, settles lovers' quarrels, - causes
epeedy and happy marriage, locates hidden
treasures, removes evil Influences; cures fits:
drunkenness cured without the patient a
knowledge; tells If your loved one Is true; en-
ables you to win the affection of any one you
desire; also that which a person is best adapt-
ed for In life Is pointed out; he enables you to
overcome your enemies; no matter what your
trouble Is, he can and will help you or
oharge-you nothing for his services.

ceived th.Â±t the allotments had not been made
at ail in the proportion of the ruling market

A brisk market was made on the curb for

Baltimore and Ohio, Southern Railway and
Union Pacific stocks. Money was easy.
NEW YORK. March 2.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's financial cablegram says:
All departments were quiet on the Stock Ex
change to-day excepting cinly American shares,
which responded willingly at the opening to the

first eales were above parity and prices hard
ened gradually during the day, closing at the
top.

100, or $254,425 above the figure reported for the
previous week. The gain cf $1,086,200 In cash,
In view of the known losses by the banks in
their operations with the Sub-Treasury, is not
easily explained, but the most probable solu
tion is that the receipts from the interior were
heavier than anticipated. 1/oans expanded
J2.40S.500, which was also a surprise, as liqui
dation had been hea.vy during the week. The
gain dees not reflect corporate deals of magni
tude, and as rumors of Impending large opera
tions have created a belief In a coming dis
turbance In the money market, many conserva
tlv-j interests have been securing themselves
, againsf possible higher rates by taking out
time leans at prevailing quotations. The in
i fluence of this borrowing shows in the present
| statement. Deposits rose $3,327,100. owing to
the Mantes In loans and cash already noted,
and the ad led reserve requirement called for
by this expansion explains why surplus reserve
increases wera not heavier. Viewed In every
light, the statement Is of a favorable charac
ter, although the small changes are of them
selves rather unimportant. The one factor
which will bear watching over the next two
we^ks is the trend of money to or from this
â¢ center. As it is, the banks have sent very
little money to the interior, the prevailing
movements having been almost persistently In
this direction. The official statements of new
b-inks in different sections of the country in
dicate a strong condition of reserves, but the
general business outlook Is such that spring
trade requirements may work changes of lm
portarce In the New York money market. In
the matter of surplus reserves the banks here
show only narrow fluctuations from the course
of the Fame item last year, and It is wortli
keeping In mind that the surplus reserve Item,
which stood at about thirteen and a half mil
lion* for the corresponding week one year ago,
fell In fourteen days to about two and two
thirds millions, although there was a recovery
in the succeeding four or five weeks to nearly
$1"> 000 000. Still, one year ago national bank
note currency Was $100,000,000 less and the gen
eral stocks of money was much lower than at
present. Eliminating the Influence of pending
deals of unusual importance, the course of the
money market over the next few weeks ap
pears to He within limits of narrow fluctua
i tlons.
