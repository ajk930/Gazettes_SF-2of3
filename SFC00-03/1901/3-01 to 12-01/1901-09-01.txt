So little is the human mind understood.
It is believable that some of these men
possessed influence of which they had no
proper conception. At any rate Hassan
the diver had the utmost confidence - in
the powers of Mahmoud, and so when
the latter suggested to Hassan con
fidentially one day that he should conceal
his most valuable findings for a time,
-without qualm of conscience the diver
obeyed, hiding nearly all his acquisitions
each descent, before he arose to the sur
face, in places which Mahmoud previous
ly mentioned to him. The day of the dis
covery Mahmoud made a prediction based
on his occult power that a pearl of value
would be found in a post located at a cer
tain point in the fishing " ground. "-. This;
was imparted secretly to the. boat agent
or supervisor, who, possessing Â¦ his -, own
share of superstition, was profoundly im
pressed with the discovery. Subsequent*'
fy, Mahmoud thinking It over, decided
that -the general superintendent, an Eng-,
Us&man. might not _vi$w r the. matter. in.
Some eight months previous at one of
the pearl fisheries on the shores of the
Persian Gulf a young^iiver. Hassan, had
fallen under suspicion. He >ad secured
no pea-rls of value for nearly a month,
though previously very successful; while
in the crevice of a post well under water
In the vicinity of his work, had been found
b. pearl of considerable worth. This dis
covery hau not been communicated to the
diver, but he was being closely watched
and if found guilty of secreting pearls, his
life might pay the penalty. He was an
honest, simple-minded fellow, who had
left. his native town of Khamir, impelled
by a desire to secure some measure of
wealth before marrying the girl of his
choice. Perhaps that fact had something
to do with the actuai facts in the case,
but much more is undoubtedly at
tributable to the influence of Mahmoud,
the shark-charmer, who accompanied the
boat and whom Hassan had come to re
era.rd as a superior, being. It was Mah
moud, who, by his incantations and ges
ticulations, kept the sharks away from
the divers when they descended beneath
the dark water and were engaged in their
perilous tasks. Indeed at times Mah
moud would plunge into, the waves, for
he was a powerful swimmer, and. accord
ing to his own account, send these mon
eters of the deep scurrying far away In
Xear of his â¢wrath.
"Good! And how about the papers
necessary to clear from the port?*.'
"A fishing permit only will be required,
which can be readily obtained."
"Praise to Allah! And. Hassan." he con
tinued, addressing the wearer of the fes
In quite a different ianguage, "do you feel
equal to the undertaking?" :
"Rest assured that I do. sir."
"Good," said the old man; "then if this
Infidel has not deceived us we shalt re
trieve our fortunes here. I shall get a
little sum for my old age and you enough
to enable you to marry the maid of Laris
tan."
"And you know the exact location T"
"Yes."
"And yon are sure It could not have
been shifted by the cyclone V
"Reasonably certain; it lies so wedged ia

There were eight occupants, five sailors
and three passengers, the former engaged
In handling the prao and the latter seated
In the shadow of the sail near the stern.
One of these was a beardless 'young man,
not above 25 years of age. of swarthy
Caucasian type, wearing a much-faded
jacket, trousers of Persian pattern and
red fes. Another of about the same age
Vas creesed in ordinary Visayan garb, his
countenance evincing more than the or
dinary native Intelligence. The third, a
man much older than the other two, wore
a turban, a tob or sack-shaped gown and
baggy trousers, all of which had ]Rrobably
been white at some time, but now present
ed an appearance of dirty brown, mottled
In places with yellow and black blotches.

100 yards north of the light is a *PÂ«*r

As the best naked diver cannot remaia

a strong effort to wrench open the looker,

sald that a projecting crag of bowjdaC

eyes took on a curious > expression.- Ha
placed an iron bar in the diver's band
and explained to him about prying open
the â¢ locker, but said nothing as to tha
' overhanging bowlder.
Straight and lithe Hassan stood upoa
the outrall, a perfect specimen of physi
cal manhood. He had listened to Mah
moud" â¢ Instructions, and knew that his
utmost power as a diver would be triad,
for the naked diver can exert but little
physical force under the water, and that
at the risk of rupturing a blood vessel or
suffocation. But not a tremor of fear did
be show or a quiver of his pliant body as
he disappeared into the wavo-crestod
water. . - Â¦ â¢"-. \-- - ..---â¢
Mahmoud, squatting on - tha < outran
again, â¢renewed his Incantations and get*
tlculatlons with greater vehemsne* than
before. Max â¢ held the shell Una now, â¢
awaiting Hassan's signal, so the old rays
tic had naught to do but exert bis occult
power, in voice and movements, which ha
did much to tha astonishment of the Moro
sailors stationed- about balancing tha
- swaying, rocking motion of the proa. Â¦ Â¦
f A minute passed and Max had reoefrwS
no sign from the man below. Mahmoud
ceased his antics and began counting tha
seconds. - Thirtyâ fortyâ fiftyâ two minute* ;
and i no signal. Hassan 'must be drowned.'
Mahmoud directed Max to pull .him upÂ»
The line -was unweightedâ altachfd" to
nothing, with the end freshly broken. *- . Â¦
' Mahmoud's eyes - glittered - with excite
ment. He quickly. divested himself of his
tob and trousers, intrusting them, with
his cane, . to Max. It was observed that
ha had a â¢ stiff , flap-covered pocket at
tached to a belt about his waist as~hÂ«
placed his, foot in. the extra weight Una
and snapped the guide line in It 3 place.
and his face exhibited an exultant, deter
mined look .as he disappeared. He must
:have thought that Hassan was crushed
by the -bowlder or suffocated from over*
exertion;. and must have entered the nar
row cabin.- believing there would be on*
less to share the treasure.
Is there a balancing principle In Nature
that measures and adjrttts men to their
deeds and motives as4f*3ajusts the waves
to the wind and tide? -The shark-charmer
bad. reckoned on all conditions except thÂ»
*ne he. should have known moat about.
He observed with slight* surprise as ha
entered the junk that the bowlder was
In place, the locker was open and no>
signs of Hassan's body. As he thrust
his hand into the aperture to secure tha
coveted treasure, something touched his
person, and turning he saw a dozen fiery
eyes, above, below, all around him, bulg
ing, from the swaying maculated bodies
of those lithe-tinned bloodhounds of the
deep, tiger-sharks,' which Infest the wa
ters of the Pecados; and in another in
stant he. was an insensate mass staining
that:watÂ«r with his gore. .â¢Â¦
Mahmoud .had forgotten that though
Â¦harks seldom attack living men. they are
swift to devour, the defenseless drowning,
and that long after the --corpses of a
wteck are consumed they are wont to re
vlilt the places , of their feasts and are
sure to be attjjfcted there by the presence
of ltving menTy.
. Thus it came'about that Max the diver,
- whose - home is in. the pretty little town
of lsabela'deMlsamis, has suddenly ac
quired wealth, and thus is explained tha
' recent ! uresence of a Â¦ man 'in Hollo who
spake no language that could be under
stood. Just prior to making hl3 : descent
'the truth flashed upon Hassan, a sort of
intuition as to Mahmoud's motives, and
ha resolved to use his skill for. his own
advantage. ' Wrenching open .the lid of
s the locker,' he grasped the canes,*. secured
: them to hls'belt in an instant, and swam,
outf rising some distance from the prao
'in. the hollow, of a wave/, whence another
. dive brought' him to the Â¦ nearest of tha
Pecados;'. and' none too~'soon for tha
sharks ' had 'caught the scent 'of human

This uas the gathering place for Indians;
cf the Kiowa. Comanche and Wichita,
tribes, when the redskins felt that - tho :
Government was in debt to them. The :
towneite was named in Washington after
General Lawton of Philippine fame.
On July 29 the registration closed at El

Now a tall Texan presides over thÂ« daÂ«

Lawton quenched her thirst over small
bottles at 50 cents apiece. Prior to that
(Only bad whisky and "tin top>" wer*
'smuggled in through back ways and sold
under cover.
After the saloons came to be a factor la
Lawton all the scenes of a real mining;
camp were founu here. I was astonlahea
to see a man with a silk tile step on to a
dance platform and go swirling across thÂ»
rough floor with a woman. Had that
dance been In Dodge City he would havÂ«
suftered for his impudence, but silk hats
have come to the border, it seems, to stay.
Young men in shirt waists were there,
too, and they were not so much aa "In
sulted.." Arm in arm with fellows wear
ing hig-h-heeled boots they went. ThÂ« \
smell of the ranch was blended -with thÂ«
pcent of the drygoods store. It was a
good r.atured crowd, all jolly mixers and
hard drinkers.
Some of the sure thing gamblers at
Lawton have | games so rank that -evsn
the Indians, whose gambling proclivities
are notorious, stand around them and say,
"Heap pale face fools." But the new

Towns along the line of the Rock Island
Railroad adjoining the new country arÂ©
pressed to furnish conveyances to carry
things to Lawton, Hobart and Anadarko.
Groceries take first choice, beer second .
and lumber last. Men in new towns must
eat and drink, but they would just as soon
live under blue skies.
| Notwithstanding all the wildnessand
seeming untamability of Lawton the min

of the vicissitudes of circus life, as wÂ«

performers are well known to keep them

"This is absolutely compulsory. Of
course many pleasures common to tb*
ordinary man are missed. 'But when ona
meets a retired acrobatâ as was my pleas
ure a few days ago â a man who In bis
eighty-fifth year could lift a bullock or
climb a rope hand over hand, clean to thÂ«
peak of the main tent â one sees the re
ward of a life of absolute temperance In
air things, of outdoor labor and constant
strife to excel. -This veteran cf the circus

'mechanic' is â¢ dispensed with- and two
trained helpers foilow the 'act round the
stage wjth hands ready to. seize the wav
ering 'figure with the first sign of a fa*l.
These helpers are never once called off
until the child has mastered thoroughly
and confidently the difficult art of balanc
. ing aloft. Even in moments of completest
self-reliance there is danger of a lapse,
and only days,-- weeks and months of
Â¦training upon a' single difficult act can
-insure that proficiency which justifies a
â¢.public performance.

The music, ., the lights, the "glow of a

a new Inspiration. He begins to see that
after many months -of hard work amid
many danssÂ»rs he has ahcomplished some
thinjc which rÂ»is the marvel not only of
Â¦those of his, own age; but of his elders.
"He becomes , enthused, and a natural
emulation' inspires him to even better
work. He begins to regard training as a
pastime rather than a season of penance,
and when the following pay day he opens
a - little hank account all his own,
starting on the highway to independence
if not, indeed,. wealth, he is thankful to
those who have" spent such efforts in his
behalf, and shows it by going back Into
training with delighted zeal. Indeed, in
stead of driving them to work, as a father
drives his son into the potato patch with
his hoe in hand, I am constantly repress
ing my little performers, watchful of the
first signs of fatigue and overexertion.
Often, while traveling- through the coun
try, when -. an opportunity occurs for a
holiday, I say/ 'Which shall we do-^try
that new feat again, orj go on the excur
sion?' The answer is always the same â '
/'The new; feat! The,n, if we have time,

plished results that have delighted the
public, and never yet have I raised my
hand, either In correction or coercion,
against the little ones whom I have
trained to do the most difficult feats. In
fact. In spite of the prevailing- Continental
notion that juveniles must be hammered
Into shape, as It were, and that cuffing*
and blows are the necessary lot of the
aspiring acrobat, I believe by the more
scientific, and certainly more approved,
method, a higher standard of excellence
may be attained, afthough many believe
that the profession of acrobat is on the
decline and that there are non^, to com

who were whipped into 'wonderful pro

THE RECORD BROKEN IN TOWN BUILDING
TRAINING A CIRCUS CHILDllnan Is a sturdy specimen of the hardy
stock of Tipperary, a reliable lieutenant
of the leader, alwayB ready for the fray
and never off .his guard. William , Red
mond Is impetuous and apt to cut find
thrust, never 'at a loss for a response to
a challenge in the arena of discussion and
well beloved by his associates. Sir
Thomas Ksmonde, true to his name, Is
a type of chivalry, gentle in- demeanor,
correct In deportment, dauntless in cour
age. Thomas Power O'Connor, as facile
with tongue and pen us he was a score
of years ago, as debonair in style, as
charming in conversation, with a pleasing
personality that attracts admiration from
women as from men, holding hia own in
the House with old-time dexterity and at
the same time on the most easy social
terms with his strongest opponents. T.
M. Ilealy, the redoubtable, is as clover
and as keen with his lingual weapon as
with a rapier; incomparable in his way,
even if a trifle eccentric in his methods.
The ItedmondH, Dillon, O'Connor,' Healy
and Ksmonde are well remembered In San
Francisco, although it is many years since
they visited this city.
The names mentioned are but a few of
the four or five score that might be cited,
but they are a sample of the active and
ulert modern men that are trusted to
maintain the prestige of tho past and to
pave the way parllamentnrlly for the po
litical regeneration of their native land.
Emigration.
It may be aaked why, if the prospects
of Ireland are improving, ia her popula
tion diminishing through emigration,
Tula ia not an eavy question to answer
in a sentence. No people cling to their
holdings with greater tenacity than the
Iriuli; they have a land hunger, and no
matter h*w small the area or how mean
the hat thalr affection. for it is inexplica-
ble to a stranger to their sentiment. Sen
timent Is strong with the Irish, and it is
good that it is so; it Inspires them to do
and .to endure; ', It > thepoetry in their
veins ' that makes this unique people eo
patient, persistent and . persevering In
spite of privations and ; trials that would
produce despair in a less sentimental race.
They love their" land and want to abide
in it.
Why, then, do they leave It?
Cromwell said as he first saw it from
one of its eminences, "a bit of rising
ground," on which he cast his covet
ous eye, "This is a land worth fighting
for." The trail of that serpent' is still
thereâ the curse of Cromwell still rests on
the holy hills of Ireland, and traces of
his scourge are everywhere visible. Ho
did not "conquer the country, although* he
laid It waste, yet he and his did their
shnre in robbing tho people of their patri
mony. They live'by and on the land; that
Is the substance of their support, and
when the means of sustenance arc taken
from them or rendered Inadequate by the
exactions of landlords the alternative of
emigration is the only one open to them.
Twenty years ago the late Henry
Qeorge said what is measurably true to
day, that the system of land tenure not
merely enubles a class to exact from th,o
people of a country a famine price for
tho use of the land which Qod made, but
it also enables them to charge' a rent for
the use of the improvements of the land
which tho people themselves made, which
is purely the product .'of their own in
dustry, and which In fact Is, on the strict
est principles of Justice, their own private
property. With the knowledge and expe
rience acquired of the transactions be
tween landlords and tenants the clearest
proof of this fuct is its simple statement.
The land of Ireland would still be In Ita
original state of nature had it not been
dralned, cleared, reclaimed and â¢ f ertlTlzed
'by the enormous outlay of labor and capi
tal expended on it by the people Â«f the
present day and their forefathers,' tenant
farmers. As John Stuart Mi'l said:, "With
individual exceptions (some of them very
honorable , ones) the owners of . Irish es
tates do nothing for the land but drain
it of its" produce." /There, are certainly
honorable exceptions here and there, and
there is some tentative endeavor at en
abling the tenant holders to become free-/
holders, but it Is a dilatory,' expensive and
vexatious process, presently more â¢ profit
able to solicitors, law agents, receivers
and other attaches of the courts, than to
the people for, whose benefit it was os
tensibly designed.;,
As the land Is the basis of all Indus
tries, it is the root of reform; the culti
vation of the soil must be by free menâ'
freeholdersâ and when that Is .accom
plished, advantages will ' accrue ' to those
who are engaged In other pursuits, for
we must remember that "the Irish system
of land tenure wrongs and impoverishes
not only those who live by, and on the
land but all others In the community
as well. It roba not only the cultivators
of the soil, but. every other man of a
substantial portion of the hard-earned
fruits of his labor, no matter what may
be his trade or profession. In addition
to the Insecurity of his tenure, the tre
mendous taxes resulting from, the present
military o.perations of the "predominant
purtner" add grievously to the already al
most intolerable burdens of the people*â
and that la an AMlgned reason for ac
ci'li'iatoil emigration. Hut reasons are aa
plenty aa blackberries in season. Tim
radical evil Is the system of land tenure
which must be cured if tho proceaa of
depletion la to be arrested. It is a fair
land, but Its government lias been a
foul one. Â¦BfeSSfi
Is a strong man and a fluent, forcible
speaker, practical, hard-headed, still act
ing in. most- imperial matters with the
Unionist or Government party, but sound .
on the land question. O'Donnell of Kerry
Is a typical representative of that ancient
"kingdom." He surprised the House on
one occasion with a speech in Gaelic, con- '
talnlng any quantity of covert treason.

The Critic, which has made a specialty

critical sketch of Dlmitri Merejkowskl. by
Herbert Trench, in Its September number.
Merejkowskl ' !s thought by those who
know best to be the equal of Slenkiewicz.
A feature of the September issue Is an
â¢exhaustive account of the rise and fall of
the comic paper in America, by William
Henry Shelton. The article is illustrated
with rare reproductions from original
sources and is both instructing and amus

the most j striking of the many striking
portraits of Tolstoi ever printed. We ven

many a frame.

IRVZ2CG BACHELLER has enriched
the world of literature by another
work of sterling fiction that possesses
many of the tune qualities that made
his "Eben Holden" one of the most-talk
ed-of books of last season. "D'ri and I,"
which has been appearing serially in the
Century for the past year.' Is now pre
sented by the Lothrop Publishing Com
pany of Boston in most artistic book
form. The binding of the present volume
Is similar to that of "Eben Holden." pub
lished by the same firm, but has a charm-
Ing addition In the way of illustrations In.
soft color tints by F. C. Yohn.
"D'ri and I" tells a Btory of the War
of lSli as It became a part of the lives of
the natives of the far North Countryâ tho
Yankees and the loyal French-Americans.
It is the country that Mr. Bacheller loves
and whose Bcenery and people he de
scribes so well.
D'ri, a contraction for Darius, Is an
other dear old "Uncle Eb," but a man
younger in years and thrown in the midst
of a life of adventure. The story is told
by the hero. Ramon Bell, who rises to
the rank of captain as time goes on. He.
and D'rl are inseparable.
In the beginning we have & little of the
North Country ]\t e â¢ among j the pioneers
In the Valley of the 8t. Lawrenceâ and
a charming glimpse it is. too. .None knows
better than Mr. Bacheller how to t paint
the life of the people in homespun with
their quaint sayings and straightforward
Â¦ways. â¢,'
The scene shifts and we soon find the
hero and faithful D'ri fighting for the flag
and for liberty. Their adventures are as
numerous and varied as those of tho
Three Musketeers.
At one time they., put to flight a' troop
of British cavalry by training a fire hose
on then from the roof. of a tavern. At
another they win again by the strategy
of stirring up an Immense swarm of half
tamed wasps. They do this while the
British at early dawn are surrounding the
house. From the -windows the Americans,
take long poles and start the Insects on
the warpath and then quietly close the
Bashes and leave the wasps to do the
fighting. The result Is all that could be
desired.
Btill D'ri and Ramon cannot always win
by guile: but on the fair field they are
both all that the reader of historical nov
els could wish. D'ri Is a giant In strength
and always strives in time to help those
who need his help the most. Ramon is a
marvel at all feats of arms and in sword
play bests one of the finest swordsmen of
England and kills him during a skirmish.
in the woods.
The excitement of battle Is relieved by
a charming bit of lovemaklng . that . runs
through the tale.
Ramon falls In love with two beautiful
Bistersâ French girls of noble blood. The
matter Is Btill further complicated by the
fact that both girls love him, and it is
only In the last few pages that Mr. Bach
eller relieves the suspense and brings the
hero to the reader's way of thinking.
There Is a plot and counter plot and In
any hands less skillful than Mr. Bach
eller's It would seem that. Ramon at times
has but the most forlorn hope of ever win
ning one of the fair maids where at first
h!s success seems so certain.
The girls are captured by the English,
and a certain Lord Ronley, who Is the -Â«ol
lshed villain to perfection, takes a decided
liking to one of them. To add to the trou
ble D'ri and Ramon fall into the hands of
bis Lordship's men and Ramon Is recog
nized as the man who slew Ronley's friend
in the fight in the woods.
Ronley cannot believe that this youth
could have killed his man in fair fight, for
the dead Englishman -was considered the
best swordsman in the -whole army, so it
Is decided to put Ramon to the test for
his courage and for bis swordsmanship.
He and D'rl are taken in hand by a secret
order to be put through the severe trials.
D'ri slips from his pursuers and hides in
a greased chute, where he holds on by his
hands to keep from sliding, and with his
eye glued to a knothole sees Ramon go
through the ordeal of the sword.-
Ramon defeats all come,* and finally,
watching his opportunity, succeeds in
clapping the face *of Lord Ronley, calls
him a coward and so enrages his Lordship
that they begin a fight to the death. , .
The description of this fight is told in
D'ri's own words and Is one of the most
thrilling passages In the . many hair
breadth escapes the pair meet. Ronley,
though a villain, is not a coward, and al
most proves himself the better man :with
the sword, but Ramon Is more than a
master of the art of fence and finally
gives his opponent a severe wound.
D'rt sees them bear his comrade away
and finally hears them at the top of the
chute about to throw his body down the
elide. D'ri Immediately releases his hold
on the sides and away he goes at train
like speed until he feels himself leave the
rreased slide, shoot far. out into the. air
and then fall a frightful distance into the
water below. Ramon follows him and
would drown, he is so exhausted from his
6word play, were It not for the timely as^
-Blstance of his old chum.
This slide is bo arranged that had the
men feared for their lives and clung t to
the sides their bodies would not have had
enough Impetus to have cleared the rocks

by the Italian servant of an Englishman
residing in Italy to his master. The stories
are of fair Interest and are told with a

some of them first appeared in "The Yel

to avoid them, according to one's taste.

Appleton & Co. have 'published a, life of
King Alfred by Sir Walter Besant that
will prove a valuable addition to the other

books are published , at the nominal sum
of 86 cents with the avowed Intention of

"a series of little books dealing with vari

treating each subject in clear, j concise
language, as free as possible from tech
nical ' words and phrases, by writers , of
authority In their various spheres." ".
In 'the present volume, which Is com

Introduction, explains how the authori
ties on King Alfred are tested. He then
gives the ' genealogy of Alfred and his
descendants. Following, this he writes of
England of the ninth century; tho chlld-
Co. .The author examines the points chief
ly disputed : and : demonstrates that it Is
possible to ' reverence the* Book of Genesis
without being: slavishly bound to a literal
acceptance of what was written poetically
and figuratively. On tha" other hand, he
does not try to prove that Â©very statement

(Copyright tn the United States o2

THE family of Fungus-Smythe was
settled in Bâ shire. Mr. Smith had
mad* a fortur* In business In the
north and desired to acquire a po
sition in the south, away from the
Boil of trade, as a country gentleman. He
hfcd purchased an ancient manor house of
Elizabethan architecture and trusted to
beirg absorbed intoÂ» the exclusive class
of county people. But the county people,
as a class, .ire suspicious and not expan
sive; and to obtain recognition It behooves
the new comer to pay his footing. H*
muÂ«t give shooting parties for the gentle
men and balls for the ladies.
At the same time that Mr. Smith ac
quired Beaumanoir Hall he assumed his
mother's name of Fungus, which he added
to his own. to differentiate himself from
other Smiths and to further emphasize
his rise In the social scale, h* converted
his plain Smith Into Smythe. But when
It is said that Mr. Smith did this it must
not be supposed that the prompting spirit
lay within his ample breast. It was Mrs.
Smith who was ambitious and endeavored
to obliterate the traces or trail that led
from the mill In Lancashire to Beauman
oir In Bâehire. Mr. Smith himself was a
blunt, straightforward, worthy English
man, who detested humbug, but was in
such aw*>. of tha aspiring and domineering
senlus of Mrs. Smith that he fell in with
her views and acted as she dictated.
Life is made up of compromises and
the largest amount are arrived at in do
mestic life. Mrs. Smith had desired an
entire abandonment of the name ol Smith
and the adoption of a very high-sounding
one to which eh* or her husband had no
manner of claim.
A great ball was to b* given at Beeuu
manoir to celebrate the coming of age of
"the young squire," as Mrs. Fungus-
Smythe always now designated her son.
It really was surprising how many
county people called, when it was whis
pered that the Smythes were about to give
a dance on a large soale.
"Whatever are we to do to accommo
date them all?" asked Mrs. Fungus-
Smytha of her daughter, Jessie. "I had
not calculated on having to house the
coachman and Ledy Lumpkln's maid."
"There Is no help for it." said Jassi*.
"but we must hava a coupl* of bads put

In there, and h* can have one bad, th*
coachman the other, and tha boy's room

"Aa& Z hart so4t*4 that difficulty," said

"Good gracious 1" exclaimed Mrs. Fun
gTis-Smythe, on tha morning before the
ball. "Here is Aunt Eliza actually com
ing and ehe has left our invitationâ which
wl never expected her to accept-un
acknowledged until now. \% hat shall we
do?"
"Put up with her, of couree," said Jes-
E "But it Is putting her up. as well," com
plained Mrs. Fungus-Smythe.
"She must go in with Janie." observed
Jessie; "Janie won't mind. .
"I do hope." sighed Mrs. Smythe. "that
Aunt Eliza will not dress in extravagant
ly old costume and In crude colors.
"She is an old dear," said Jessie, "and
it really does not matter in such a crowd
as we shall have, how she dresses."
The ball went off well, and punctually
at 215 stopped. Mr. Smythe was impera
tive. His daughters, several nieces, and
other young ladies pleaded, burin vain.
The music was hushed, and by half past
the visitors had left, that is to say such
as were not staying in the house, and
those who were retired to their rooms as
Mr. Smythe and the butler extinguished
the lights in the reception rooms.
The button boy. Herbert was -his name,
but he was generally called Herbey, hung
about in the servants' ball. Nothing would
Induce him to so to bed early;' he would
retire when did Mr. Bunce, the coachman
of the" LumDkins. :
"Come now," the housekeeper said to
"Little chaps like you ought to be
n^etween the sheets â¢ and snoring, hours
agone.*'
"Please. Mrs. Jacks," answered the boy, ; :
'Tdunstn't 50 because of the ghost."
"What ghost?" asked the coachman:
"Oh, It's a story, sir," said the house
keeper, "a foolish story people have got â "
"But, ma'am, it's true that the little
?age was murdered in that very room,
've seen it in print in the guide book to
the neighborhood," said Herbey.
"That may be so." said Mrs. Jacks. "I
don't take it on me to deny that such a
thing did happen, but that was in the
old family's time. You don't suppose that
the ghost would stay on after the family
has sold the house?" . <
"It's more than one ghost," protested
the boy. .; . Â¦
"The butler was hung for murdering
him, and they say that both are seen,"
threw in one of the housemaids.
"You nedd not be frightened," said the
housekeeper cheerily. "No one "as I have
ever heard of has ever seen either ghost."
"No," retorted the boy. "And for very
good reasons, too â for none have been put
afore Into the haunted room."
"Are you put into the haunted room?"
asked Mr. Bunce, looking disconcerted.
"Yesâ and so are you," said the boy,
"and I call it a horrid shame to send a
poor little innocent boy like me into the'
room where ghosts are seen."
"Stuff," said the housekeeper, "you "will
not be alon*. Mr. Bunce will be with
you."
"And I say that I Â«*n't se* why I
should be put th*rÂ« either," protest**
the coachman.
"You're surely net afraid, . sir," ex
claimed Mrs. Jacks, staring at him. "such
a man as you, and with Herbey ther* to
protect you."
"Oh, I'm not afraid. I dart say It Is
rats, but I objects to rats. I objects to
all noises at night, that I do. Shaver!
Tell me the whole story, what was th*
boy murdered for?"
" 'Cos he saw the * butler file out the
creBts from a lot of plate, and then go
and sell it to a Jew. And he said he'd
tell."
"How did the butler kill him?"
"That there butler went to a chemist
and bought a diachylon plaster, shaped
like a heart. 'It was winter time) Uke
now, and he had a hot bottle In his bed,
and he melted the wax on thatâ of course
he put the wax outside, not against the
bottle."
"Of course," said Mr. Bunce.
"And then he clapped It over the mouth
of the j>ore boy." v
"Pore boy," repeated the coachman.'
"That smothered his screams, and it
stifled him as well." '
â¢ "But how was it found out?"
"When the boy was deadâ the wax got
cold, and the butler bad a trouble to get
the plaster off, but did it at last, and
then chucked the plaster away out i of
the window Into a bush, : where it 'ung,"
said the button boy solemnly.
"And he was discovered by it?" asked
the coachman. â¢ ... â
"He was found out- by it," said the
boy. "You see, the wax was set, hard,
and when that 'ere butler tore it off, the
wax stuck to the pore page boy's "lips
and nostrils, and that left quite a pictur*
on the plaster of where his mouth and
nose 'ad been. When the body. was found
next morning, there was. wax sticking to
the face, just at the daces where it was
missin' on the diachylon plaster. And it
was â¢ proved that the : butler . had . bought
the plaster.'and so he was convicted."
"And hung," threw, in Mr. Bunce: H*. .
"Yes, he was; hung.'.' said the; button
boy, "and what is more,- he was a fat '
gross sort o' man, much like you, Mr.
Buncc.and' they .dursn't: hang him with
*u ordinary tell rope, so they had for him
a ship's hawser." .
"Oriul,", said the coachman.

most with candles, all with ruffled head*,
and wlda extended eyes, and a singular
dearth -of bloom in their cheeks. All wera
clamoring to know what was the matter.
Had burglars broken into the house? Had
any throats been cut? Was much taken?
Whose Jewelry? Had fire broken out?
Were there. fire engines and ladders? %
Mr. Smythe pacified them.
"Nightmare! nothing but nightmare,"
was his explanation. He shut tha door
of the Haunted Room and drove Aunt
Eliza and their niece into their chamber.
By degrees ; the alarmed assembly dis
persed. â¢ ' .
Next morning Mrs. Fungus-Smythe wu
radiant. "Nothing could have been bet
ter," she said. "It was tha climax to tha
ballâ the. ghosts. AH old families have
hereditary ghosts. We have a double
name and so have two ghosts."
In -the servants'- hall Mr. Bunce was
questioned about the disturbance.
"Was it true. that you saw the ghosts?"
asked the: housekeeper.
"In the Haunted Chamber/*
"And you, Janie; you are generally ex
teemed a sensible girl. What do you
say?"
"I saw them as well. One was fat. tha

exactly as described." - , .'
"Described? By. whom?" - -
"I mean as supposed to be seen."
"But what In the world brought you
out of your room?"
"We both wanted to see tha ghosts.
That is to say â I did. and I persuaded
Aunt Eliza to tome with me."
"And now you have had your desire.
You. have seen the ghosts."
"Yes,", sighed Janie, "and I hope I shall
never see any more." * ""*
"Who made that hideous bellowing lilt*
a bull? Not you, Eliza, surely?"
"No," said the old lady In nervous ter
ror. "I couldn't bellow. I had no breath.
It must have been the ghost."
"And you went to the Haunted Cham
ber?"
"Yes," both answered faintly.
Mr. Smythe now marched boldly for
ward to the end room, the door of which
was opened. He entered. The beds were
empty. However, he saw a. large, whit a
globular something â¢ under one of them,
and stooping, he laid hold of an article
of clothing composed or wnite cotton. Ha
dragged at it, but it torÂ© in his hand,
and he reeled back holding: a fragment of
the size, of a dinner napkin. Then he
kicked at the object under tha bed and
ordered in a loud and peremptory yolce:
"Come out, you skulking rascal; coma
out!" â - -
Presently the coachman emergad and
simultaneously from under tha second bed
crawled the button boy.
"What is the meaning of v this uproar?"
asked the master of the house.
"Oh, sir, we have seen the ghost*â th*
butler and the page, both with a light
going before them andâ andâ andâ the old
one had a ship's hawser about his neckâ
the rope wherewith he was hanged."
"Nonsense." said Mr. Smythe, "it was
nothing but fancy." -
"Please, sir, I saw both. I will Uka
my dickey," said the boy.
"And so, sir. did I," threw In Mr. Bunce;
"I say it on my oath as a coachman to a
baronet."
"Why did- you both crawl under yctar
beds?" .-. . ,
"I was that frightened, partly with th*
sight of the ghosts and partly with tha
bellowing of Mr. Bunce," said tha boy.
"I was not frightened," said tha coach
man; "not I; oh, no, but I â I have my
master's interests at heart, and I know
there is no one else competent to drive
Sir Tony and my lady homeâ and it is a
long way, sir. and Brown Bess does stum

All at once Mr. Bunco's faca grew livid
and his great jaw dropped. '
"There! They are there again!" h*
gasped, and looked hastily behind **Â»Â» to
see that the coast waa clear that ha might

arm.
"Stay and do not be such a coward.
Where are the ghosta?"
"There! There. . sir, looking or*r your

Mr. Smyth* turned and saw Aunt Blisa

and pointing.
Both distinctly saw the handla of th*
door turn. l .
Instantly both leaped from bed. Tha
coachman caught up the candle and stood,
feet apart, shaking with terror and th*

stood beside him, shivering as well. Slow

about the passage, unable in the pitch

"Oh, uncle, we have seen^he ghosts!"
"Oh. James! I have seen both of them!
O,- horror! ( O. bones!"
Now other doors began to unclose, and
heads were thrust .forth and inquiries
made as to the cause of the uproar.
Mr. Smythe went boldly down the gal

before him, and he thrust them into their
room. ' - . .-
Then, standing at the door whilst they
were within, quaking and looking blank,

gasped Aunt Eliza, putting a hand on- his

It Is well in this case to "st}ck" to prin

1DEAX.S are subject to the same condi
tions of change as affect the material
world. In no department of life would
the Ideals of past generations be sat
isfactory to the men and women of to
day. If their dreams could have come to
pass In the lifetime of those who dreamed
them they might have brought content
ment and happiness, but when, in the evo
lution of ages, they reached fulfillment, a
new generation had come into existence
wlth Ideals of its own. And so always we
are looking toward the future to satisfy
our longings, 2 but through this endless
struggle to attain the Ideal the standards
of humanity are lifted up.
Since marriage Is the most vital of the
relations of life It should demand the no
blest ideals, but these are. possible only to
the most highly developed men and wom
en. As this development Increases the
ideals, broaden and those of . early days
seem Inconceivably narrow. The man of
the past was far more exacting in his re-
quirements for a wife than was. the lat
ter in hers for a husband, because his
Judgment and discrimination were | more
fully matured and also because he was in
a position to "pick and. choose." It Is Idle
for one who has no freedom. of choiceto
make stipulations, and this was absolutely
denied to the woman of the past. Unless
ehe had money, and this was seldom the
case In the "good old time," she must
marry or have a life of the most humiliat
ing'dependence on relatives and friends.
Even with ample means she was not per-
mltted by custom to make an independent
home of her own, but was forever com
pelled to prove
"How salt the savor of" another's bread.
How hard the passage to descend and , climb
. By other's Btalrs-r"
even though she \ paid \ for this privilege.
The free, -independent, greatly, envied
"bachelor maid" of to-day is a transfor
mation of the much-hampered, deeply-pit

-a small portion of the personal property.
She could not hope by work outside to
lay up something fpr old age, as her earn
ings also belonged to her husband.. â¢
â¢Almost Invariably a large of
children followed marriage, but. although
brought Into the- world at the peril of the"

dispose of them by will, even the unborn,

der these conditions was there room in
the woman's heart for any other ideal of
a husband than one /who would not avail
himself of the rights conferred by law?
No provision was made for the educa
tion of girls, and, with the household de
mands on women beginning before day
light and lasting into the night, there waa
no, opportunity for reading, study and de- v
velopment of the mind. As the wife
' saw the mental gulf widen between
herself, and her husband, naturally she
would not cherish an ideal of one who

were not considered worthy of a place
therein. We may imagine, however, that
it might have been comprised In. a single
sentence : The Ideal husband Is ; the one
who does not take advantage of the power
these women were formulating in their
minds, through all those , generations',
never will be known, for the records were
kept by men and the, opinions of "women
, Under these circumstances It la not
strange that the vast majority of women
i would rather take any chances than those
of ."single blessedness." But In those
days, as now,' the villages were denuded
of young men,, who were obliged to seek
a, livelihood elsewhere, and even, In the
larger places the marriageable men went
to eea or to war or' "out west" to find a'
fortune. "With . more prospective wives

% strong necessity for marriage on the part,

education herself. Bhe was not fitted for
an Intellectual Â¦ companionship, and, al
though she would feel a' natural" pride In.
any high position her husband might at
tain, she was little adapted to bear her
share of Its honors. .
7 In all ages.women have striven to em
body the ideal of themselves which men
_ have cherished, and the latter have been
so situated that they could search for the
Ideal wife, " defer marriage until she was
: found, or,- failing In the quest, lead useful,
. honored, Independent lives, in no wise af
Â¦ fected by the fact of never 'having wed

were comprehensively expressed in the
Thirty-first Proverbâ virtue above allÂ«lse,
and N then the perfect housekeeper, indus
trious, â¢ benevolent, God-fearing, at work
before ' daylight In the morning and not
letting her candle go out at night. : For
Â¦uncounted generations women strove to
' live up to the standard of this woman In
the Proverbs, and If they , fell behind oc
casionally the preachers, . the elders and
the husbands pointed to -the Good Hook
and. spurred them on.
What sort, of an Ideal for a husband
- times of small fortunes, she had no re
course except school teaching ' for. a pit
tance or the unrewarded slavery of the
â¢needle. "Even these oDDortunltlea were
few and her usual fate was the unpaid,
-little-regarded position of the spinster
drudge in the family of a married brother
or sister, without honor and without prof
it," and with the general verdict of having
made a failure of life.
An Ideal husband will not come Into the
presence of wife and children exhaling the
odor of liquor and tobacco. In olden times
The man of to-day does not find his
equanimity very rudely disturbed when
his blushing bride declines to promise at
the altar "to obey;" He has rather more
respect for her fpr not doing It. The old
attitude of sovereignty â¢ on one hand and
obedience on the other has largely disap
peared. Enlightened men no longer marry
for. the purpose of getting a housekeeper,
or with the sole object of raising a family
of children, but through the desire of con
genial companionship and with the Inten
tion of stimulating the development of the
Â¦wife along the lines for which she Is best
fitted. Thus far we have the Ideal hus
band, not universally, but In sufficient
numbers to offer much hope for the fu
ture. . .
Woman is* now, for the first time In all
history. ; so situated that Bhe can create
an ideal husband and not be compelled to
accept a substitute, and she has set the
standard far beyond any that the woman
of the past could have dreamed of. Her
very first 'exaction that he should recog
nize her equality of rights, legal and do
mestic, would have thrown the forefathers
into a fit" of apoplexy and paralyzed the
foremothers, but the best type of manhood
In the present generrilon Is not at all dis
turbed , by this, demand. He Is not like
his ancestors,'' who placed their- honor, in
the sacred keeping of the wife, but were
very careful that she did not get a chance
at the pocketbook. Her request that a
portion of the family Income be set apart
for her. sole. use and and that she be not
asked to give an account of the same does
not seem unreasonable to him. I remem
ber distinctly, however, a case that came
under my observation many years ago.
A man of large means was very desirous
of marrying a school teacher. He paid the
most assiduous court; he used every pos
sible argument; and finally one day, when
he had melted into tears and declared that
his life would be ruined without her, she
told him frankly that she did not like to
give up her financial Independence for tha
dependent condition of all her married
friends, but if he would secure to her the
same' income which she was now receiv
ing she would marry him. He dried his
tears, asked a few days to think It over,
wept away und never came back! Such
an Idea was too preposterous to be enter
tained by ir. Â»n of past generations.
Â¦ For the past two generations men have
been approaching this Ideal, slowly at
first, and with extreme caution, but sat
isfied with the experiment, they have
made practically no retrogressive steps,
although there never has been ,a time
when they did not have It In their pow*r
to .withdraw all the privileges .which had
been granted. With the new womanhood
which' has thus developed, the man's
ideals. of a wife have broadened to In
clude many attributes which never wouM
have occurred to his forefathers. Virtue
Is still first In the list, but, before even
the domestic qualities, the man of bra'ns
places . an education. ' The modern man.
wants also a : public-spirited woman,
whose Ideas reach beyond the Hmlt3 of
her own household. The highest Ideal of
his ancestors would by no, means, satisfy
his own requirements for a wife.
.Our foremothers kept no record of their.
Ideal man, not even on the faded pages
of those little worn diaries. Wherever
their brief, practical entries go beyond
the details of the household expenses and
the family Illnesses. Into the realm of
aspiration, it Is always ! In regard to the
heavenly, life. The conditions of this onÂ©
they considered beyond remedy'. But. un
derstanding' the nature j of woman, and'
knowing that her dearest hbpes. her fond
est desires, are concentrated In the fu
ture of her children, we may wel* believe
that these old-time mothers did dream of
an' Ideal husband for their daughters, and
that, if Interpreted, it would have read:
"A man who will lift-woman up to a plane
with himself." . . .;
would be even stronger Intellectually.
Since she was denied all participation In
the church, except a timid recital / In
prayer meeting, of an "experience" which
she never would have dared to give In
full and since her religious nature was
constantly appealed to In order to keep
her submissive under her wrongs, Â«he
certainly would not create an Ideal man
who should be still more devoted to the
religion of his fathers. She never would
have. formed an ideal of a more "master
ful" man, of one who would take greater
pride fn his position as the "head of the
family."
The woman of to-day has a moral Ideal.
Bhe dreams of a time when there shall be
but one standard of virtue for the two
sexes. Its fulfillment Is no more Impossi
ble than what we already have seen. The>
attitude of society toward, the Immoral
man is gradually changing. Like the Â¦
drunkard, he Is be.Hnn'njr to cover hl3
tracks. His lapses are no longer a matter
of pride. The new self-respect of woman
Is protesting against man's defiance of the
moral code and he Is commencing to feel
the effects of a social ostracism, which
will increase as women grrow stronger In
self-reliance. And here again thÂ« revised
statutes come to the rescue of the wife
and relieve her from that body of llvtn*
deathâ a husband who la unfaithful to hia
marriage vows.
There never has been a time when
man did not desire to find favor In the eyes
of woman, to fulfill her ideal if It did not
require too great a personal sacrifice. But
until woman herself had reached a higher
plane she could not make a loftier one for
. him. Her evolution has been slow and
long and sorrowful: it is by no rar\n*
complete, but It has been ereater In \fie>
last > fifty years than In centuries which
preceded. Until now man has seemed In
finitely ahead of her and her thought haa
been to attain his ideal of her. rather than
tp create one for him. But as she realises
. more and more the possibilities which He
Â¦within herself, out of this very knowledge
comes the conception of a nobler manhood!
and' of this she dreamsâ but a grander
womanhood, too. Is always In her vision.
The Ideal husband will stand first of all
for the freedom of the wife. He will pro
vide that marriage shall place upon her
,no more restrictions than It imposes upon
him. He will treat her always as his equal
In every respect, as his beloved compan
ion, his nearest and best friend. ! He will
make his personal life as clean and purs
as he desires hers to be. As his Ideal
motherhood Is the. one which he would
have his' daughters Imitate, so he will em
body in himself a fatherhood which shall
be the standard for his sons. Xevar until
recent generations could women wait for
this Ideal, for It was only through the as
slstance of man that she could secure the
necessities of life and a dependant cannot
make terms, but it Is no Ioneer obligatory
for any woman to sacrifice herself In mar
" rtage. She has, now for the first time, the*
power to choose,- and already we have a
finer type of manhood than the world ever
before has known. The demand of women
is responsible for this and. as Its scope
Increase. It will continue to be met. In the
fullness of time we shall have the Ideal
man and he will Include within himself
the Ideal husband, father, son and brother.
It Is doubtful If women would have, dared
form such an Ideal aa this, but already It
Is partly reached. Then liquor was on
every sideboard, and ladles -withdrew
from the dinner table In order that gen
tlemen (?) might get drunk. Now the gen
tleman who gets drunk carefully conceals
that fact from the ladlea of his acquaint
ance. Where foimerly the woman endured
the Intemperate husband as her Inevitable
lot, the law now steps in and sets her
free. Â» The abolition of the tobacco habit
forms a part of the future Ideal.

SUSAN BANTHONY WRITES OF
THE IDEAL HUSBANDant we will take that up. My advice is.
do not ship provisions into the valley. As
the price * of groceries at the store is
regulated by. the commissioners, and as
1 have found them very reasonable,' I
believe campers will find it more satis
factory to buy at the store in Yosemite.'
Prices are 15 to 20 per cent higher than
in . the city, but one is saved the freight
and general nuisance at both ends. This
year our box arrived the day before we
left. ;
The following list is suggested for a
party *f three, to last four or five days!
2 packages rolled eats, 3 pounds pilot bis
cuit, 2 pounds cheese, 2 pounds sugar, 1
pound : coffee, z pounds bacon, 2 pounds
chocolate; canned goodsâ 2 cans' beans, 2
cans fruit, : 2 cans condensed milk and 1
can syrup. Concerning the. milk, I have
always found that the- second grade, \ if
well recommended, is as â¢satisfactory as
the fancy article. A small can or- bottle
of syrup will' be ample. Add to this list
a square of butter, a little salt, pepper,
tea and vinegar, and you should be able
to reach, the valley with full
j Some people would add to this even a can
of corned beef, ; one of sardines and one
of deviled ham. , :
Then the personal -kit is a very import^
ant matter. Many long tramps have
taught me ' that the following: are neces
sary: Soap, two or three towels, tooth
brush, pocket knife, comb, four handker
chiefs, candle, shoe 'laces, four pairs
, socks/ table knife, fork" and spoon, tin
plate and cup. I believe that a large cup
Â¦with a cover, will be found useful. besides
the small ! cup. . Some may need I to carry
shaving soap,; razor and brush. - As \ for
head gear I found a . straw ; hat and an
English cap to answer all purposes. The,
latter was useful because i It was not' only..
inexpensive but could be stowed away
In the - pocket if desired. . :
'A' reporter once : ; interviewed 'General
Carr. thp celebrated . Indian : . i fighter.
"What . are > the : most important matters
In a campaign?" . .V :.;:... , ; ; Â±\ Â¦_:Â¦ \ ' : : ;
"The men's stomachs and feet."
/',*-..' . ' :* - ' /
"But what about the fighting?"
"Oh, that's a detail." ...
So in. one of these tramps the same es
sential conditions prevail. To tramp well:
Â¦one must be. well fed and sleep comfort
ably. But, - really, more, than these, .he
must take the greatest care of his feet.
Â¦To ".attain .'.this' end ithe "traveler should
wear a pair of shoes that have been thor
oughly broken in. Provided they are good
and strong, the footwear of everyday use
willÂ«be sufficient.-. Be : sure, however, that
the soles Â¦ are strong and thickâan oak-
I tap sole is said; to be.the best. It might
be' an'' advantaged to'"have a, half-moon
patch sewed on each side of the foot as a
protection f against granite chips : on v th*
trails. Moreover, one should take along
a : pair '.of 'strong leather slippers, ? or daiic
ing pumps/ or light ties. Should
the ; regular shoes . chafe "while .'on ; the"
march it is; a. great benefit to change, off
and 'give. the sore spots a chance to heal.
Moreover, â¢' It ; is Â¦ of the utmost advantage
* to put these"; on in' the morning, on" rising
'â¢ and ; on , making camp at night. J: The I'very
; change (from . heavy to \ light \ footwear in
. the; latter ; case i is ; wonderful. The '1 feet
' have' enough of the heavier "shoes on the
march. Save them all you can Vat 'other
times. : . â¢;,â., V; _ ; â¢ : " "'Â¦'.'
As. f or^ blankets, the most Important de-~
tall, in this regard is a'\ rubber 'blanket, or
piece of canvas, to lay on the ground to
prevent the dampness of the ground from
crawling into, your bones. Then I have
found that two thicknesses of good blank
et under me and six over was sufficient.
This may seem a great deal to some, but
I did not find it any too much, even with
all my clothes: on, during two or three
nights. At one camping place th* top
â¢lanket ' was about soaked . with - cold
moisture when" I rose.- *N.
As to the arrangement of the blankets,
if there are two sleeping together one rub
ber-blanket will do,.- and three doubl*
blankets, as the mutual warmth is'con
siderable./ This would give two thick
nesses below and; four' above. But my
experience on three long tramps has been
that* more is required if; sleeping j alone.
To accomplish this I doubled two blankets
separately ; and . laid one on 1 top- of the
other. Then taking; a heavy needle and
some strong thread, doubled, I sewed up
the bottom and one side and half way up
the other. ' -.This made Â¦ a bag in which I
could crawl; its great advantage of design
being. I found, that il, could have any
thickness, of cover I desired. Many a
night I.: have .fallen- asleep, comfortably
under two thicknesses, only to wake in
the middle of the night and crawl under
, two > more; :, . , : -
I found myself considerably bothered
with' the cold down my back and shoulders
because the : blankets would [ not ; fl t Â¦ com
fortably around my neck. This was easily
remedied by continuing. the stitches at the
! top'; of the' bag, three ' or ', four 'inches f foin
the back ; .seam/ This" device caused; the
bag to -fit snugly behind. : ..-. Y
.. On retiring i I 'would ~ remove the â¢ sock*
used during the' day's tramp and, if . con
veniehtl wash the^f eet*. I .would then draw
on the socks to be used the next day/ arid
over, these in cool j weather 'a.' heavy, large
pair. ..This: method, piyes freedom tojthe
feet and keeps them warm. By nomeaai
HOW much heat can a human b*.
ing stand?
Thousands of New Yorkers asked
themselves i this question when
thermometers on Broadway registered 103
degrees. The system of a normal person
can endure twice that' much. It Is Quit*
possible to tone It up to withstand 604
degrees of heat.
Nowhere in the world does th* solas
heat begin to approach man's capacity
for resistance. In Death Valley, CaL, th*
thermometer has registered 140 degree*
Fahrenheit. The ordinary man "n and
does adjust himself to th* cUm&U la

Dr. Sambon. of London, the greatest au

ever,' far from that at which normal
health is more or less In danger.
The doctors declare that anything above
85 degrees in a . temperate climate, such
as that -which New Tor k Is supposed to
enjoy, constitutes a menace.
â¢ The chief reason for this Is, naturally,
that: the human system In the temperate

HOW MUCH HEAT
CAN A HUMAN
BEING STAND?
sirable camp requires the following: A
flat dry place, with*Â»Â»Â»neth!ng to make
your resting place easy, if possible; plenty
of good water; plenty of fuel, but with
freedom from danger of setting the coun
try on fire: protection from wind, as an
exposed place might make sleeping un
comfortable.
â¢ How to find all these necessary quali
ties in a camp is difficult; therefore, I say
that if you reach such a place between 4
and 5 in the afternoon with a good day's
work behind you make a camp by all
means, especially if you are uncertain of
the road ahead. If you put it on! an hour
or two you may find the sun going down
and your party half way up some grade
â¢with no camping place within five miles.
Moreover do not choose a settlement for
a camp if it can be avoided; except to
purchase supplies this is a disadvantage
rather than otherwise.
Now let us consider what is necessary
on a camping expedition- to the individ
ual and to the party. Let us figure on a
party of three. First on the list is a coffee
pot. The size of this should be in pro
portion of one pint (two cups) to each
person. A two-quart camping pot can be
obtained for 35 cents. Be sure to boil it
out thoroughly with soap and then with
fresh . water. Frying panâ for three this
should be of good size; for five I would
add a small enÂ». This can fit inside the
larger. Sauce pans: Get a granite "dou
ble boiler"; this will answer about all the
purposes of an exacting camp cook in this
respect. Rope: Even if there Is no ani
mal with the party I contend that a coil
of clothes line, twenty-five or thirty feet,
is desirable for emergencies. Dish towels,
three or four. Brown soap. Two galvan
ized table spoons. Small butcher knife,
if no belt knife is carried in the party.
Can opener and matches..
I regard a compass as indispensable on
such a journey, for the safety of the
party. Be provided with a . cloth covered
canteen. This can be obtained for 35 cent3
upward at gun shops. When necessary
fill with water and soak the felt. Evapo
ration, keeps the water cool: Good maps
are a great convenience and sometimes a
"necessity. Address the Director, United
States Geological Survey, Washington, D.
C. enclose 10 cents (not in stamps), and
he will send you two magnificent maps
that are worth ten times the money. Ask
for Yosemite and Sonora squares.
For .the benefit of the party, and. to
avoid two persons carrying the same
things, I would suggest the following: ' A
Email variety of needles, black and 'whit*
thread (not too fine), a few buttons, a
email pair of scissors, a cheap thimble, a
small bit of wax, a. little tape, and three
papers of safety, plna, small, medium and
large." Last .but not least, a few bachelor
buttons. Â¦..-.;, .
As the subject of eating is very. Import-
R-^GING. boiling volcano of sliver
f I and diamonds. Such are the Ne
r"H vada Falls this year, and the rest
â¢ I of Yowmite doÂ«s not suffer by
contrast. It has been truly a
grand year In the valley, for the snow has
been heavy on the high Sierras and the
streams full In consequence, which has
riven us m&mlflcent falls and abundant
vegetation.
TÂ» a person Â«Â£ means visiting Yosemite
VanÂ«y Is a very simple matter. It con
sists ef buying- a round-trip ticket, pack
la* Â» Tails* and taking the proper train
aad stag*. Arriving in the valley one can
stay at th* ketel or find accommodations
at #aÂ« of th* permanent camps. But to a
person of limited means a visit to the
ET*t.t park 1* bo Â«uch simple matter, and
uu *ogg*etlons to this das* I believe are
aimers aoceÂ»tablt.
Â£â¢Â«Â« people znake a mistake In visiting
th* valley at ail. If you are going to cal
cttlat* the amount of building material in
El Ce.pl tan. if you are going to sigh over
the amount ef power In Bridal Veil going
te waste, or compare the view before you
wtth that seen from Mount Lowe or St.
Bplft&a ia favor ef th* last two, you would
brtter stay aÂ«xjr, Tou will certainly
1TMt* yeur â¢trn time and annoy your
BflffhbcM with your remarks.
Ther* are flv* methods of visiting the
TfJ|eT-Â«*y ttig*. by wagon, by horse, on
Â¦Â» blsjole ani on foot. While the last may
tare serious Aitadvantages to some, after
all many ptcpie believe It to be the only
tnÂ»* way Â«f getting th* most oi/t of the
tflp. At this na* been my favorite
aeUaed, i ffjy en Â«er a few suggestions to
tÂ°y vho aay wish to make the at
ttcj>t.
If * 9*ftr *â¬ three Â»r more eta be ar
**Â»f*4 It If very, desirable to havÂ© a pack
â¢Stall, lrot aÂ» this involve* complication
ia th* rHw* *t expense, care *f the ani
mal, tn* Â«<jlectio-. of a proper one. etc., I
will net ventur* tÂ» eay any more on this
polfit If it 1Â» eeclded to carry the lug.
gar* frcm flfteea to eighteen pounds must
be calculated. Six to seven pounds will
be allowed for blankets, and the re
mainder for personal articles, cooking
utensils and provisions.
As for the best method of carrying a
pack I can only B ay that there are as
tnar.y different methods as there are peo
ple who carry a pack. However, the style
that suits me best is to roll my package
as tight and as cylindrical as possible and'
eling it from one ahoulder to the opposite
hip by a strap. O n the inside of this
etrap, at the shoulder, have a broader
piece of leather sewed to protect the
Bhoulder from liability to chafe.
Right here let r ae offer a word ef ad
vice that, if followed, will relieve the
travelers of 8om<s unnecessary trouble
while on the march,. When packing up In
the morning bo arrange matters that at
lunchtime there -will be no unpacking to
be done; and, moreover, if it is necessary
to stop and cook 'dinner before
camp for the night ther* will be little re-
packing.
Tramping through, an almost uninhabit
ed country and among. lonely mountains
one would naturally suppose that when;
It comes time to make camp all that is.
necessary Is to Etop wherever you 'are.
Unless you dispel this Illusion ; you are^ 1
Quite likely to regret having harbored*
Euch an idea. Bear ' in mind tlÂ»at a de
4 'Â¦â¢''Â¦ *-' 'Â¦
wear your shoe* at night. - .
While on this subject let me Â«ay that I
am accustomed to cut out two or thre*
pairs of insoles from extra good quality
of cardboard. I would suggest this for the
double purpose of keeping the stockings
clean and to make the feet fit snug In case
the shoes prove a trifle too loose, In which,
case it is as bad as being too tight. More
over, should the feet swell, as does hap
pen sometimes, the cardboard can be re
moved. On the contrary. If yÂ° ur shoe8 â¢*â¢
snug and, your feet swell you are literally
â¢â¢in a box." If you take the trouble to cut
these insoles, make a good job of it, a*
otherwise they will do you no good.
As the head, neck and ears may be cold
during the night a handkerchief laid over
the head and the four corners drawn to
gether under the chin and fastened with a
safety pin will be sufficient for comfort.
Now 'concerning the routes. Of thes*
there' are three; â¢ and it Is not necessary,
nor do I suggest, that the same route bÂ«
taken both* ways.
Route 1-Take, night boat to Stockton.
Fare. 50 cents; berth, 50 cents to IL Rail
to Chinese Camp: fare, $3 50. From hero
It Is sixty-five miles to the guardian's
office In the valley. Th* road is good.
The first heavy grad* la Priest* Hill,
about 2200 feet from thÂ« river to Bi* Oak
Flat, or 3200 inall. Qroveland Is tb* last
place to make purchase*. From her* to
Crockers (or Sequoia) th* country undu
lates. At Hogdon ranch. 467S feet, begin*
thelast long grade; reachinr 7200 *t Gin
Flat, when the long descent into thÂ« val
ley begins. I. would suggest right -her*
that "Oh My Point" be named Exclama
tion Point. One* of the great features of
this route is the South Fork of the Tuol
umne Cany on. and the beautiful fall*.
Route 2â Take train to Merced, $4 S5.
-The distance to the valley is eighty miles.
The road is fair-as good as any for. onÂ©
who is tramping. . First heavy grade Is
after. leaving Coulterville. about 1200 feet.
At the latter ' place , the ' last purchases
must be made. â¢There are fine camping
: places after passing; Dudley. â From Bow
ers Cave another grade of -2000 feet is en
" countered, reaching 5000 feet in altitude.
Near Merced Grove 6000 feet Is reached.
*Froni here into the valley the road rolls
gently.' only, exceeding the altitude named
by two or three hundred feet. The great
-feature of this route is the beauty of the
:- high Sierras unfolding at every important
' bend in ( tbe roadâ something which is de
nied on other routes. Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦',"
Route 3â Take rail to Raymond, J6. Dis
tance into the valley sixty-eight miles. A
heavy grade is ' reached . on \ crossing ' the
Chowchilla Mountains, .6000 feet above the
sea. â¢; At -Wawona-. supplies., can be ob
tained^ From here the grade is 2200,feetâ
then , comes '. the , dip ] Into . the valley.' The
greaVfeature of this route is the;Wa'wGna
y alley, . second only : to To'semite,' Â¦ Sid*
-trips of half a day â¢*ch will UkÂ» on* tÂ«
the Marlposa big trees and to Chllunslna
Falls. Roads are Tery good on this route.
Concerning expenses other than trans
portation: My bill for provisions two
years ago was $7. This year It was $8.
These Included some meals taken on th*
boat, at different towns and once fn th*
valley. This year my Incidentals amount
ed to $1 60-on my last trip the Item was
much less. In providing for a trip $1
should be Included In the estimate for toll
-60 cents each way, It will be seen by
these figures that, omitting the Item of
clothing and personal equipment; blank
ets, etc., a tramping trip to the Yosemlts
can be undertaken for fifteen or twenty
dollars, according to the route. As for
*the tim* of the tramp four days should
be allowed on the first and third route*
and five on the second.

he lavished his fortune.
Havemeyer.v "the J sugar king," was
interested with him. It was said, for
political service rendered, . and put vast
sums into the enterprise, probably two
millions being expended on the building
and furnishing. The late Senator Hearst
was also- said to have been a heavy
investor in the hotel. ;
It was made a stock company, and
Chamberlin and others received a large
block of the common stock for their out

Interest on the enormous .sum it had

at Palm Beach and elsewhere on the
Atlantic coast, 'with improved railway
service, seriously interfered with the suc
cess of the venture. . "g
But the fact that Chamberlin could, se

shows the strength of his political Influ

Chamberlin's terrapin with champagne

through the magic cookery of the hour.
Terrapin With. Champagne.
Chamberlin was a quiet, dominant man,
of singular executive ability. He. said
little. His cooking did the talking, and
it was a power in the land. It passed
bills and secured pensions. In the aroma
of Chamberlin's incomparable cookery
hostile legislation disappeared.
The Influence of John Chamberlin in the
political life of his period was remark
able. In his house great political schemes
were arranged, and his mediation between
the interested parties over a dinner at
Chamberlin's was a sine qua non.
Was a bill to be rushed through, a pen
sion granted, a position obtained? John
Chamberlin was the man to seek for ad-
Vice.
Many were the stories told of "Sam"
Ward's gastronomic triumphs in winning
Senatorial support to important bills â how
he cooked his hams and compounded won
derful drinks, supposed to warm the
heart and expand the brain, as was dis
closed during a legislative inquiry. But
Chamberlin's entertainments excited no
criticism. Without their knowledge al
most, he appealed to the Senators through
their stomachs, by exquisitely cooked
dishes, his famous terrapin and deviled
crabs, rare old wines and liquors, and
through his generous personality.
Inaccessible men like Grover Cleveland
and the crusty old Senators who defied
lobbying lawyers and pretty women
alike. It Is said that Mr. Chamberlin was
the only Intimate friend Roscoe Conkling
never quarreled with. Conkling said :
"Why call him John Chamberlin? There
Is but one Chamberlin." And yet they
always addressed each other by the first

ATHLETIC OUTLOOK AT

GOSSIPY ECHOES FROM
THE DEL MONTE BLINKS
DESPITE the occasional .umplral
troubles that keep the California
Baseball League in more or less
periodic ferment, baseball In thla
city is rapidly . reaching Its old
halcyon â¢ prosperity. . The crowd
that packs the Recreation grounds on
Sundays Is composed of fanatics, some
mild and harmless, others rabid and al
most violent.^ As Â¦ In the 'days.' of old,
when scores . were< memorized . and. the
merest detail- of the^ diamond noted, the
habitual attendant of the games to;day
spouts his knowledge whenever chance of
fers. The fanatic has come once again.'
The fanatic is a peculiar order of being.
At times he rouses himself Into a state of
enthusiasm to fall in line with others of
the same sort.; Then he bubbles over,
cackles and is ready, to shake chairs at
the harmless air because ' his team has
done | something the other ;' fellows have
not.! He is Just as fanatical in his grief.
Being decidedly partisan, when his team
loser, he mopes and storms and calls for
a half of this man and that. - ; If there
happens to be a series of black and white
changes in the /game his emotions oscil
late with Just as much regularity of com
mutation. - : . '

The '"fans" are growing In San Fran-
The first tournament to be played Is
the doubles and will commence on Tues
day. It" will be completed Wednesday
and the rest of the week will be occupied
by the singles. The championship match
of the doubles will be played on Saturday
afternoon and the championship singles
match on Monday afternoon.
The singles tournament will probably go
to either R. N, Whitney, Bell, Smith or
Weihe. None of these is expected to win
the championship from George Whitney.
Probably the strongest teams in dorbles
will be Bell and Braley, McGavin and
Smith and Collier. and Crowell, and. one of
these teams will in all probability play the
"Whitneys for the championship. ..-,'.-â¢' Â¦:
The present visit of the Southern Cali
fornia experts will do more toward ." the
advancement of tennis on this coast than
anything that has happened in years. The
success of the women's events makes the
success of the men's i tournaments next
week a certainty. Bell, Braley, Hen
dricks and Sinsabaugh, the Southern Cali
fornia cracks, have all arrived and have
entered both 'the singles, and doubles.
The .Whltneys will probably carry off the
honors In both singles and . doubles, but
will be closely pressed by some of the
second class men. It will be interesting
to know Just how the local second class
men will come out with the experts from
the south. â¢'. â¢Â¦Â¦'. â¢-.Â¦' . :â¢ *
Probably the most interesting event
from the spectators' standpoint was the
mixed doubles tournament. Usually these
affairs are very uninteresting and tire
some andresolve themselves Into a match
between the two men, but with such play
ers as the Suttons, Seymours, Miss Hall
and Miss Hoffman in the line-up they are
more Interesting than either the doubles
or singles. ' * '.'
The women's tournaments of the past
week have successful beyond the
hopes of even the most- sanguine." The
success of the- events Is undoubtedly at
tributable to the presence of the six clever
players from Southern California. To
say that the play of the Suttons -was a
surprise would be to put It but weakly.
Such tennis as these clever sisters have
played in the past week has never been
equaled by any woman on this coast be
fore. The most remarkable thing Is that
four Bisters should be so evenly matched
as these are. Heretofore the women's
championship has attracted little or no
attention, but this year the women's
events are as interesting as the men's.
The San Franciscos will drop the clam
bake at McNears Landing set for Sep
tember 8, and the dance at the club
house scheduled for September 14, and
will merge the two events in one grand
clam-bake on September 14 and 15. The
clam-bake a few weeks ago at * Paradise
Cove . was got up by a few enthusiastic
members and was.eo much enjoyed that
it was decided that a similar entertain
ment 6hould be given by the club In lieu
of a dance which would be attended
â¢ hiefly by non-members and would do no
particular good to the yachtsmen.
A large entry list Is expected, and a
second trial of speed between the cup
challenger Helen and the defender Presto
is looked forward to with great interest.
Commodore A. E. Chapman and the
Vallejo yachtsmen believe that the sioop
Helen Is fast enough to beat Frank
Stone's boat, while the Corinthians believe
that when some changes have been made
In Presto, she will beat Helen 'much
more decisively than on August 10.
Next Saturday, September 7, Is an open
day on the schedule of the Corinthians,
while the San Franciscos have a cruise
to McNears Landing, . but this ,will be
dropped. On Monday, September 9, the
sixth annual regatta of the Pacific Inter-
Club Yacht Association will take place,
the yachts being divided into the usual
six classes, with prizes in five classes pro
vided from the Macdonough trophy fund.
The prize for the twenty-footers will be
the Law cup, presented by Herbert ! E.
Law, at one time commodore of the Pa
cific Yacht Club of happy memory.
According to schedule, the San Fran
clscos were to start yesterday for an out
side cruise to Drakes Bay at 3 o'clock .in
the afternoon an signal from the flagship.
But Commodore W. N. McCarthy's
schooner Ramona is still in .southern
waters, and at the time of writing it Is
doubtful If the cruise will be made or not
The yawl Roye.l and the sloops Cygnus
and Thetis, with probably H. R. Simpkins'
yawl Tramentana, were expected to make
the cruise. If the boats make Drakes
Bay there will be a picnic and sports to
day, the return being made to-morrow.
The Corinthians started yesterday for
Lakeville, where they will, spend to-day,
returning to TIburon to-morrow. The
California!) have on their schedule a
cruise to McNears Landing for last night,
continuing on up to Lakeville to-day and
returning to Oakland Creek to-morrow.

But the Ariels have not even the con
solation of having succeeded, and were
kept completely in the dark until .their
protests were unavailing. They feel the
more injured because they attribute the
juggling whereby their crew -was ex
cluded to a man who for many years rep
resented their club on the board of man
agers of the Pacific Association, but who
has now transferred his allegiance to the
Post street club. ' A general feeling ' Is
growing among the oarsmen that tho
management of the affairs of the associa
tion has fallen, almost entirely into* the
hands of i men -who no longer ' take any
part In active sports.
Then the Ariels had been all along as
sured that their barge crew would bo
among those selected, but no notice was
given to any of them or to J. A. Qeddes,
their representative, and chairman of the
regatta committee, at what time tickets
for the railroad had been received or
would be distributed. Some of them had
their, trunks packed ready for the sum
mons which never came. Tet the Ariels
had the only, four who could fairly be
said | to be entitled to . go north on thÂ»
ground of their previous performances as
oarsmen, Robert Bills and "W. T. Hove
being seniors, and Harry Poley and L.
Smith being the two strongest men of tha
crew that won the junior barge cham
pionship at the Lake Merritt regatta. The
Alameda crew has In It only one senior
oarsman, P. W. Ayers, while the Olympio
crew's best man was second in the Junior
skiff race at Lake Merritt. The Univer
sity of California shell crew does not con
tain a single man fit to row In a. craft
of that class. When the Question of what
crews should be chosen was In the early
stages of discussion It was stated that
the Astorlans wished to have men who
could take part in other aquatic or land
sports. Now this is a condition which
the Ariels fulfilled especially well, Harry
Foley being a runner and a champion
middleweight boxer, Howe being a swim
mer, Smith a fine water polo player, and
Hanlon being the champion bantam
weight boxer of the Coast. The- Olympio
Club did not even enter a barge crew at
the Lake Merritt regatta, and at one of
last year's regattas a four comprising
some of the oarsmen who went to Astoria
rowed absolutely last of five crews. The
South End barge crew included a. wrest
ler and two moderate single scullers. The
Alamedaa feel that a deliberate attempt
was made to shut them out, but are much
pleased j that promptitude on their part
and a knowledge of railroad affairs made
the attempt fruitless.
The one topic of discussion among tha
oarsmen during the past week has been
the Astoria regatta: . It is generally felt
that there was an unfair distribution of
the . tickets to the north, the Olympic
Club securing about one-half of. the whole
number, while all the rowing: clubs
shared the remaining: half. It has al
ways been understood that the Alameda
and Ariel barge crews would go north,
but a day or two before the time for start
ing the Alameda representative was told
that only two men from this club would
receive transportation. v He stood firm,
however, and insisted that at least four
oarsmen" should be Included, the only con
cession he was willing to make being 'in
regard to the cockswain. Then he was
informed that the ' Alameda boats must
be at the depot that afternoon, and, short
as the time was, this was done,' only to
find "that the car was locked Â¦ and the
yardmaster had been strictly Instructed
not to open it- However, choking a cat
with cream fs not the only way of killing
it, and when the car was opened at As
toria an Alameda barge and skiff were
found in it. ' *"

Arrangements have been made that Cal
ifornia coursers take in this meet, get
their dogs acclimated and reach St. Louis
in ample time so that a four or five days*
rest will be allowed their dogs.
The affair will be run under the Amer
ican coursing rules and its two stakes
will be unlimited. The programme will
be the running of the Aberdeen cup event
and a puppy stake. Entries will close
September 24.
Through the kindness of the Union
Coursing Park directors. Judge Grace will
have a vacation that he may go on to
judge the big stake. The Madison (S. D.)
Coursing Club has made a bid for Cali
fornia dogs to compete in their strike. At
one time it looked as If there would be a.
conflict In dates with this and tne St.
Â¦t^;uis Club and some etronp feeling was
'.manifested. The selection of Judge Grace
settled all differences, for the Madi<>on
Club gave way on that account because
of the Interest the Judge's presence would
add to the game throughout the country.
Rather than cause unpleasant feeling the
club voluntarily advanced its date to Sep
tember 25. 26 and 27.
Judge Grace's reputation has traveled
before him and it is with a feeling of se
curity that the dog owners throughout
the country anticipate the running of
their hounds.
The prettiest compliment that could be
frfven to the game at home was the selec
tion of Judge John Grace to preside In
the saddle in this big event* Since it was
published that the judge would to a cer
tainty accept the invitation congratula
tions have been extended to the club from
all sides for having secured the services
of the veteran leashman.
California will be well represented in the
running and Is already named as a likely
candidate for first honors. Many of our
best flyers have been almost promised to
the stake and if one of them should return
-with first honors It would further boom
the sport at home. .. ' .Â¦>, â¢â¢!.;
American Waterloo, a stake that calls for
sixty-four nominations and which will be
run at St. Louis in October next, has a
full entry card, the first time since its in
troduction.
In the hands of true sportsmen whose
one aim is to make coursing a clean sport
and one above suspicion, the pastime has
found favor in the eyes of its strong fol
lowing, and as a result . stands well up
on the list of our attractions. Gaining
steadily in popularity, the game, through
the unselfish actions of the committee
which controls it. has made the raising of
greyhounds a remunerative business on
this coast and through which the ad
vancenjf nt In breeding has attained such
a star.dkrc^ that local strains will coon
figure as the best in the world. California
is looked upon as the home of honest
coursing in this country and its hounds
are sought by other States for both field
*.nd stud..
Â¦ As a result of the boom that Is on the
This year will mark an era in coursing
in the East and the success that has fol
lowed the game there is due in no little
way to the favorable results \shlch have
attended the efforts of local leashmen un
der whose care and attention the sport
has reached its present high standard of
excellence.
Hardly a day passes that some dog own
er does not announce himself as an appli
cant for three or four entries on the East
ern stakes. ' To a certainty the game has
received an Impetus In States where It has
been run horetofore with indifferent suc
cess. * --Â¦ ~ .._-â¢â¢- .:
The exodus of coursing men with their
greyhounds to compete in the meetings
of other States will, if all engagements
are kept, result in a dearth of champions
during their absence.
If circumstances force a later date for
this high-class affair the change will be
accepted gracefully by the ringsters, for,
while they are anxious to have the young
performers test their i^srlts. still they
would feel out of place seeing, their
champions run without having a ticket or
two on the result.
"While preparations are about completed
for the Futurity it is no certainty that the
big stake will be ran according to sched
ule. If the present labor troubles are not
settled soon it Is more than a possibility
that the rich stake for the young cours
?rs will have to be postponed. '" The
amount of added money in this annual
event cuts quite a figure with the park
man'.KPTtient and to see itself clear the as
sociation depends on a. good gate and a
healthy play. Without these there will
be a deficit and it is not likely that for the
sake of a postponement the park will
Etand to lose on the stake.
Last Sunday's double card at Union
Park brought out a large crowd that was
well In evidence up to the running .of the
final. The day's sport was the be6t that
had been seen at the park for some time.
but the events were for smaller purses
than have been run for since the game
has reached its present standard.
Sunday finds the same plunger,- the
Fame piker, both with the same willing
ness to put up a bunch or two on their
choice, but finds them without the price
to play their Judgment.
The effects of the strike are felt In
coursing circles. The game goes merrily
on and the best dog* tn the running axe

patrons, but the bettors are not so active

MODELSyou." he replies courteously.
Nobody can get It out of him.
And yet there must be a story there. His
writings show that. His lonely life makes
a past romance more probable. It takes
much trouble to make any man sufficient

And what has become of the wealth that
he ' is supposed to j have j gathered? /. Has
he any one to whom to leave it? Will his
death J reveal - its whereabouts and Its

end cannot he far off. But his story may
be known before the end comes.
PERHAPS the mystery of the Los
Angeles Man in Raps is to be BOlved
at last. ' .
He is soon to publish his long
promised book. Will it tell the tale
cf his etranee life?
For long years past Los Angeles has
beÂ«n guessing at it. And still the guessing
keeps on. for the story has never yet been
told. .. *_s
"Where does the Man in Rags obtain his
money*" asks one. For in ppite of hi3
coftunie of rags Walter Masterton has
never been known to beg. Indeed he has
many a time politely refused offered
money. He lives on year after year at
the same little lodging-house at 21S Third
street, and his monthly payment has
never failed to be promptly on hand.
Evidently the Man in Rags has some un
seen source of income. The . possible
amount of it keeps .guessers on pins -and
needles. â¢ â¢
"Why does he wear the rag suit?" asks
For if he has enough means for
f^il wants, as he claims, there must be
'gome other reason than poverty for his
strange dress. And he does not seem In
sane.
"Has he had a romantic past?" they
ack. Ah. there the guessing grows hotter.
There are all kinds of suspicions as to his
past, and that it waa an adventurous one
looks likely.
That he haE great-wealth; that" an un
happy love affair drove him to his isolated
lifeâ these things are hinted at and not
without some ground.
Through his writings they have been
guessed. For Walter Maaterton, the Man
in Rare* is a poet. Odd little snatches of
Eong he eends forth now and then, and
through many of them runs the sorry
theme of joys that have been.
Putting many a two and two* together,
those who know the old map best have
woven this much of his story.
In pioneer days he came to California to
Eeek his fortune and he found it. In the
mining country he amassed great wealth
and all bade fair to be well with him, for
he was in love, too, and what more does
a man want than to be comfortably in
love and making money hand over fist at
tlje same time? â¢
â¢ The woman was a widow. She bad fol
%wed her husband, a husband not worth
following, to the mining camp. There be
died as he ought to. and she was left
with her little boy.
The miners had always respected and
liked her: now they^rallled to her in her
trouble. .With a good -many of them it
. Â¦*ca& L _ J _mare_iih.an \, rnere,^klnd.nes*-Â»* that
prompted them to do this, for she was a
beautiful woman and a charming one.
But she had" only friendliness for themâ
all but one. That one was Walter Master*
ton.
Little by little they grew to love one
another. Her little boy was almost as dear
to Masterton as was the woman -herself.
He wanted to take care of them both,
helpless as they were.
This world looked like a very happy
place to him at that time. He could not
believe that there .was any real trouble
in it.
Then It came, all of a crash. The woman
disappeared with the 'child just as he had
thought them his.
His wealth meant nothing to him then.
He must have wandered a great deal be
fore he settled down in Los Angeles. Peo
ple say that he was all the time hunting.
He has never found them. Perhaps he
cherishes bitterness against, the woman.
But the child's face seems to haunt him to
this day. 11 was only lately that he saw
in a magazine a picture of Adolph
PetEch's little boy, a sunny-haired little
Californian. After much inquiry he found
out the address of the family and called
upon the little fellow. He coaxed him in
every way, offering him gifts of oranges.
He has clung to the child's friendship ever
since, a friendship formed in so sudden
and unaccountable a way. People say
that the boy reminds himâ but that,
again, is guesswork. .-'.-Â¦â¢_
His costume, entirely made of patches
sewn together, is always immaculate. He
washes it himself. It would be uneentle
manly to be slovenly, and Walter Master
ton Is a 'gentleman.
He has for year3 haunted the public 1U
brary, poring over the heaviest works on
history and sociology, and he has a tre
mendous store of. learning accumulated.
All the time that he has been reading he
has been writing, too, and now his book
is nearly ready.
He talks intelligently upon subjects of
political economy.' He is extremely radi
cal without being violent in his opinions.
He would not overturn government by !
means of a cyclone.
He has eo often been. asked to tell his
etory that the questions have grown tire
some, and yet he never, grows impolite in '
his answers. "My story cannot interest

Male models are the easiest to obtain In
.this city at the present time. Two years
ago this was riot the case. A young man

A very necessary article in the modern
studio is the "model book." This contains
anywhere from a hundred to two hundred
names, and yet our "musketeers of . the
brush" dilate on the scarcity of good
models. SIg. Cadenasso says: "We have
about . three good female and as many
male models who pose ; for, the 'alto
gether." Heads, knees, ankles and feet
are easier to get, but a figure nicely mold
ed and* possessing most or all of the smal
ler details is as hard to obtain as a Klon
dike nugget."
Often a picture which ii apparently a
simple portrait of a society girl is a com
posite I collection of several models; the
face of one, the shoulders of another, and
the arms ef a .third. : Each artist general
ly has one or ; two favorites who serve as
material for his average work, or furnish
the \ "basis" for a 'composite; picture.
" Wenzell,' Johnson 'and others who have
had one; model for, several years/ have
been -heard to remark that they could r.ot
get inspiration "from any < one , else. This
Is certainly an exception to the rule. '-,.â¢Â¦-
A man or â¢ woman iÂ»ay be beautiful,
have .faultless curves and perfect fea
tures, yet be sadly, expressionless.- This is
the i principal fault found with .young, in-'
experienced models. A good model Is not
. necessarily a perfect man or woman.but
one who can by.his ri understanding throw,
great "motion" _ J into his pose. .

THE STTINDAT CALI*
THE MAN IN RAGSOne night he paid a surreptitious visit
to the theater along with an older cousin
who was trying to teach him- the way's of
this wicked world. He thought he was in "
heaven when the s curtain , rose on a
dazzling scene. During the entire per
formance he hardly breathed and never
took his eyes from the stage. At the con
clusion of the play he refused to leave the
enchanted spot. His business 'in life" was
decided then and there.
His lirst . appearance, on Ine-stage was
as a venerable genius In a. transforma
tion scene, his duty being to look wise
and benevolent through a mask of
snowy whiskers "while cccupyiiig a pro- 1
carious position en the edge of a scenic >
and presumably, celestial, cloud, i He bal
anced so well that he was soon intrusted
with parts of importance;- ami -at- the end
of three years had p'.ayed leading busi
ness with Edwin Booth, Lawrence Bar
rett, Jane Cocmbs and Charlgtte Cramp

In the youns man. - Instructed in rti - e

Shakespearean roles fcyj Forrest and Mac
Â«cÂ«AQy. * ._Â» . * v : .' * Â¦* Â¦ r Â¦
Later on, when John- McCul lough of
feredhim a position as leading support
he gladly accepted the- offer For tn-ee
years he traveled with McCullough Dlay-
Ing I;igo in -Othello." IcilJus in "V,r
einius" and Phasarkis. in ./'The cilatiisi
tor." The last named piece was o n the
beards the night of the great tragedian's
collapse, and it was Joseph. Haworth who
gave him physical support,and attempted
to prompt h.m. It a "crowded house ,
that rang with applause that night. That
epeech tellirffe of the Roman crucifixion
had just ended; the was to rec
ognize his long lost brother. McCulloucrh '
threw himself, on* the shoulders of Ha
worth. There was a strange trembling
that made Joe look up, and he saw Mc-
Cullough's face ghastly pale; great beads
of perspiration upRn it.- - Â¦ .
McCullough moa/ied, "For God's sake
Joe, give me the next line," and so" he
asked for line i.fter hue. until he became
eo bewildered that he turned to Haworth
â¢â¢Why, man, you're saying my lines and
yours! This was heard < through the
house. Wild -shouts, hisses and hurrahs '
mingled In uproar. The curtain fell upon
fc scene of laughter and derision. .
Joseph hasn't always had a snap, how
ever. Probably he deserves ; it by this"
time. He has-been on the- stage "ever
since he was a youngster and became
Btago struck. He had strict parents, who
disapproved of- the theater so ardently
that they are very likely responsible for
their young son's taking to- it. with the
zeal he exhibited. v; r^-->
All of these roles and many more this
romantic actor knows down to" the
ground. But it Is, another proposition to
the company awaiting him, especially to
Miss Laura Nelson Hall, the 9 leading
woman. While-; he goes ' mechanically
through parts that are machinery., now to
him. she must be cramming en a new one
every week and" no thanks from the
atrdlcnce. She will be expected to be as
letter perfect as if she had always played
the same roles. Audiences do not make
allowances. A new play every 'week, and
when Ha worth's season is. ended there
wil! be new stock stars to come with their
pieces, new to her. and her cramming will
continue. It's the leading woman who
deserves to be prayed. for. and the star
who has the snap.
The star wlio is to open in a stock star
company at the Grand is Joseph Haworth.
He begins a six weeks' engagement in
"Rosedale." The rest of his plays have
not been decided upon.
That is the scheme that the Grand
Opera-house is trying. The management
of that house proposes to keep a stock
company here all the time; then to .em
ploy different stars, one at a time, of
course, who shall bring their own reper
toire and be supported in it by the stock
company awaiting them.
It is a revival that dates back to the
famous days of the old California The
ater's stock company. Then such a
name as Booth or Iiarrett headed the
list as star of the company, while the
other players lived here the year round
and were ready to support each star as
he or she appeared.
rFIE Grand Opera-house Is experl
fmentlng in the stock-star business.
It is so very old a method that it
is new to us now. and theatrical
circles are eager to see how it
works. Â».

SAMPSON VERY
SERIOUSLY ILL
Rear Admiral Schley's attorneys have
almost completed* their written brief In
his behalf. It contains about 60,000 words.
The precept of the court is taken up and
each paragraph is discussed exhaustively.
The Howison Incident.
Acting Secretary of the Navy Hackett
regards the Howison incident as definite
ly closed as far as the Navy Department
is concerned. Rear Admiral Howison
will not be relieved from duty as a^fhem
ber of the court In advance of its assem
bly. When the court meets Rear Admiral
Schley's counsel will object to his con
tinuing as a member and will state' their
reasons. The other membersâ Admiral
Dewey and Rear Admiral Benhamâ will
pass upon" this objection and if they find
th3 seasons sufficient. to sustain it, Rear
Admiral Howison will then be relieved
and the Navy Department will have to
find some officer to take his place.
Sampson's Testimony.
Rear Admiral Sampson's testimony be
fore the Schley court of inquiry may be
taken "at Burke Haven. N. H., If that
officer Is 'physically unable to come to
Washington to appear before the court.
In that event, it is probable that the en
tire court will adjourn to Burke Haven.
It is barely possible that Admiral Samp
son's testimony may be taken by deposi
tion, but if so it will be a dep_axlUEe_from
the strict rules governing naval courts^
The law officers of the Navy Department
are authority for the statement that dep
osition are absolutely inadmissible before
a naval court-martial. Courts "of Inquiry
follow in a general way the rule3 for
courts martial, and while the court . of
inquiry generally has much more lati
tude than a court-martial, it is expected
-that on account of the great importance
cf the present case the rules will be fol
lowed very strictly, and an { objection
from counsel on e.^her side to the taking
of testimony by deposition would com
pel the court to adjourn to Rear Ad
miral Sampson's home if he should not
be able to appear.
No Political Enemies.
He has no political record and .there
fore no political enemies. He has noth
ing' to explain, for be has not mixed in
civil affairs. Should the court of inquiry
acquit him, it is predicted h|s popularity
will become so great as to make him the
logical nominee of the Democratic party.
. So say Marylanders,Nand they are so
* earnest about it they have already ar
ranged for taking up the matter with
him formally as soon as the court of'in
quiry shall have handed in Its findings.
one present expressed the opinion that he
was undoubtedly one of the very few
men in the country on whom the entire
party could unite.
1 At a meeting of Maryland Democratic
leaders held in Baltimore the availability
of Schley for Presidential purposes was
seriously discussed, and it Is said every
50 years, instead of 62.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHÂ£^GTON, Aug. 31.â The Mary
land friends of Admiral Schley, assum
ing that the "court of inquiry will trium-\
pbantly acquit him of* the charges tinder
Â¦which he " has been resting since the
Spanish war, are already quietly talking
of bringing him forward as a candidate
for the Democratic Presidential nomina
tion in 1304.
â¢ Schley will retire from active duty this
year and In 1S04 will be 65 years of. age.
With a robust constitution, which has
been well preserved, he is now in his
prime and the years sit so lightly upon
him that he might easily pass for a man

The I general situation in Colombia Is
divisible under three headsâ the isthmus
revolution, the progress made throughout
the rest of the country and the situation
on - the Venezuelan and Ecuadorean
frontiers. Tfie revolution is progressing
in ; the rest of the country with varying
success. The Liberals hold various towns
and _ districts, and decline to meet the
Government punitive expeditions, with
drawing upon their approach and return
ing, after their departure to engage, in
other and similar tactics, with occasional
small engagements. '-< \ : \:1
' Endless rumors are afloat, but the con
sensus, of^ the best informed conservative
opinion discredits- serious hostilities or
anything more than a continuation of the
Liberal's guerrilla system of engagements
with the : Government's ' force. The. Lib
erals are anxious to get a seaport, and
hence their" recent approach to Bocas del
Toro, west of here. The Government is
not bringing 'reinforcements to the
isthmus. There are about -J00 men . at
Colon, and at Panama a thousand men
are available if needed.
COLON, Colombia, August 31.â Quiet
on the isthmus. The recent
Liberal concentration . in this vicinity
seems to have disappeared. Whatever
their' numbers, the Liberals are poorly
armed and without leaders, lack -organi
zation for concerted action, and hence can
avail themselves, of no opportunity to
damage the Government.
Liberals Desire a Seaport.
General 1 Davila has got prestige in Ven
ezuela in view of his defeat and capture
of the noted Venezuelan- revolutionist.
General Hernandez (El Mocho). His
presence, on*.-. the frontier is one of the

seize every, strategic /advantage. ,
". There are" Colombian troops hear -* Sa'n"

drawing 20,000 bolivars dally from the

He knows that the Colombian ' revolution

thirteen, and at least three are fatally

Mr.' Downs and his son left on Monday
In the private car with his guests, Lieu

officer, . and wife. They accompanied
their guests as far east as Minot, N. D.,
and were ' returning home when the
wreck^ occurred. Kirk Downs was about
21 years of age and was employed as sec
cretary by his father. ,
Colonel Downs' death has cast a gloom
over the entire city. He was one of the
best liked railroad men ever stationed
here. A native of Ireland and 51 years
of age, he had spent thirty-three years
in railroaat service. To-morrow he was
to have assumed the duties of vice presi
dent of the Spokane Falls and Northern
and of the Kootenai Valley roads" at the
personal request of J. J. Hill. He. is sur
vived by a widow, now visiting in Bakers

Blue of San Francisco. Â¦
Colonel Downs Is Mourned.
The fire was so fierce that the rear
sleeper could not be saved, though It had
not left the track. Its occupants were
hurried into forward cars which were
hauled ahead out of the- reach of the
fire. The flames extended to the . brush
alongside the track and burned down the
telegraph poles. ' A wire break followed,
which with a storm, greatly retarded
telegraphic news of the wreck. The first
message sent went to Kalispell, whence
the wrecker and all doctors in that town
were ordered to the scene. The Injured
were given every attention and as soon
as possible the train with its grewsome
burden of dead, dying and injured was
taken to Kalispell.
The runaway tore down the hill at
lightning speed, rounding the most severe
curves at a rate of upward of seventy
miles an hour, where regular trains bare
ly crawled along. With a roar it burst
around the curve, and what Is most re
markable, jumped a split switch which
would have turned it to the sidetrack and
crashed into the passenger. There was
neither time nor opportunity for escape.
Air. Downs' car and that of the laborers
was smashed Into kindling wood, the oc
cupants of the private car meeting in
stant death. The debris and shingles and
lumber of the freight burned like tinder.
The train -crew was forced back from
its work of rescue by the flames. One
man penetrated as far as the private car,
where, he said, he saw the bodies of Mr.
Downs and his son and from where he
dragged the body of the cook. In the
laborers' car many of the forty-six occu
pants were so pinned In that they could
not be reached and burned to death be
fore the eyes of the spectators.
Hunaway Train's Wild 3>ash.
The point where the wild train crashed
into the passenger was several
feet away and It was two and a half
hours before the flames reached the main
wreck. Meanwhile frantic efforts were
made 'to take out the dead and Injured.
The wreck was piled high and wedged
Into almost hopeless confusion and In
spite of superhuman efforts the flames
burned their way to the wrecked cars
betcre the work was completed.
J. H. Blair, the colof ed cook In Mr.
Downs' car, was taken out alive, but died
In a few minutes. It was impossible to
get at the bodies of Superintendent
Downs and son. _
As the runaway train sped by the switch
it struck a caboose and day coach on the
siding, wrecking them. Fire immediately
started from the oily lamps in the ca
boose.
Flames Attack Wrecked Cars.
SPOKANE, Aug. 31.â All reports Indi
cate that the wreck on the Great North
ern, forty miles east of Kalispell, Mont.,
was the worst in the road^s history, one
of the most awful in the~~annals of
American railroading. Thirty-six lives,,
were lost and ten persons were injured.
Three of the Injured will die and the oth
erc are seriously hurt
By strenuous and heroic effort fifteen of
the bodies were taken from the wrecked
cars. All of the other victims were cre
mated. Including Superintendent P. L.
Downs and his son, T. Kirk Downs.
There Is a severe grade near the scene
of the wreck. Two engines had taken a
train of twenty-eight freight cars up this
grade and drawn off to take water. "While
doing this all twenty-eight cars' started
down the grade. The runaway train
dashed . down at frightful speed and
crashed into the car of westbound passen
ger No. 3, near the siding at Nyack. Su
perintendent Downs' private car was at-
I tached to the passenger, and next to it
was a day coach filled with railroad labor
ers from Duluth.

It appears that the wreck was caused
by an east-bound freight train of twenty
eight cars, which was at Essex, and tha6
the : head engine went forward, leaving' a
helper engine in the rear to hold the train.
The helper engine set the airbrakes and
left the train standing on the track and
went to coal up. \ , '
, Conductor Matthews was in the' office
getting | orders and ' both brakemen were
with the engines. It is -believed that,: the
air leaked and that the train slipped away
without the train crew knowing it and
dashed down the mountain at a tremend
ous rate of speed, '.variously | estimated a t
from seventy-five to one hundred .-miles
an hour, going down ' the hill | a distance
of seventeen miles before it overtook the
passenger. â¢ This . train was moving in the
same direction as the runaway, otherwise
the disaster would have beengreater. ; The
men on the passenger train had not the
slightest warning of: their danger.- ~~
There is. nothing. of the wreck left but
smoldering - ashes andr bent and twisted
Iron rods and chains. â¢>Â¦ â¢ -.- \ ,.
' There were many poor creatures pinned
under the wreckage whom the passengers
and I trainmen did all in their power to
extricate from their ' frightful position.
The wreckage took fire immediately after
the collision and it was with the greatest
difficulty that the few saved were taken
from the â¢ ruins. Several men were loud
ly callingÂ«for help, begging that if they
could not be got out they be killed rather
than suffer death in the rapidly approach
ing flames. Would-be rescuers were com
pelled by reason of the intense heat to
stand aside and see the . victims burned
alive, powerless to lend aid or assistance.
Ten cars of shingles were on the rear
of the freight that caused the wreck. As
soon as the freight struck the standing
passenger ; train the. cars burst' and the
shingles were, thrown in all directions
over the wrecked passenger cars. Almost
in an* instant the whole was a mass of
flames "and the work of , rescue was ren
dered ; dangerous. \ 'Â¦Â¦-'-Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦..
KALISPELL, Mont., Aug. * 31.â The

that more lives were lost than ever be

one deaths have been reported up to the
present time, and in all probability more,
will follow. Five dead were brought to
Kalispell, together with thirteen wounded
and seriously hurt, one of whom has
since died. Of the forty-three men in the

Records of Season aft
. Saratoga Show High
Playing.,
SARATOGA, Aug. 31.â The season of
gambling in Saratoga ended at midnight
to-night, and shortly after 1 o'clock on
Monday; morning the season of carnival
will begin. The gamblers have , had | a
short but, generally speaking, a profitable
summer. There are just four places which
property may be called gambling housesâ
the. Saratoga Club, Chicago Club,";Man
hattan Club-, and United States' Club.
There are two or - three other, cheap af
fairs, but they cut no figure..
Big money has been \ staked at these
four, houses and all but one of them have
made money. The play has. been light all
summer . at- the United States \ Club, ; and
for that Â¦ reason its profits have been of
the kind which gamblers find fault' with.
But, -as for. the rest, Richard A. Canfield
of â¢ the Saratoga Club, James Kennedy,
"Big Jim 1 "- his friends; call him,, of the
Chicago Club, and Westcott and Tom
Jolly;of the Manhattan, will be richer. by
many thousands of dollars when they get
back to New York than when they came
here early in the summer.;-.
. : The feature of the gambling here has
been the r high j play at the Saratoga Club.
Nowhere in the world, and this statement
is < made ; on the authority of those who
know the > world's , great gambling houses
and business they, do, has there ever been
seen such high; play.- as ,'<has been seen
at the Saratoga. Club -this season. .:A lit

Members of the Premier's
Family Urging Him to
Resign.
LOXDON, Aug. SLâ Rumors of Lord
Salisbury's retirement are due to the ex
istence of an agitation within the Pre-
mier*s own family that he take- the step
in order to preserve his health. His sons
and daughters believe the strain of con
ducting the affairs of the empire Is bound
to shorten his life.
In this they have been opposed by sev
eral less closely related members of the
Cecil family, and almost -all thÂ© leaders
of the Unionist party. The latter, bo far
as can be learned, are likely to prevail
for the present, at any rate in their con
tention that relief from the duties of
Premier would be a very doubtful bene
fit to- Lord Salisbury's health, which, just
' now, is not bad, considering his age. "
. In former times when his retirement
Â¦was mooted the opposition to such a etep
was based on the absolute necessity for
Lord Salisbury's presence in the Foreign
Office. Thanks to Lord Lansdowne's
apparent ability to handle that depart
i ment, this necessity no longer exists, but
: the cry has now changed and the Union
'ists admit that the selection of a suc
cessor to Lord Salisbury would perhaps
â¢precipitate an internal struggle. Hence,
the extreme, and as some of the mem
bers of Lord Salisbury's family consider,
almost inhuman pressure on the Premier
to retain power, which,' for him, has lost
all attraction.

replies from a number, of prominent labor
organizations advocates in Great Britain
to an inquiry from Gompers 'as to
whether- It is -true that England's Indus

whether this is the fault of the trades
unions.
. The replies are all negative as to the
influence of the unions. George Barnes,
general secretary of the Amalgamated
Society of j Engineers, Manchester, . Eng
land, .says that "those industries, which
are best organized on the ' workmen's side
are the most prosperous industries of the
country. The shipbuilding, engineering,
coal getting and cotton spinning are well
organized industries and were never so
prosperous, whereas, on the other hand,
the heavy textile industries, shoemaking
and several other industries that might
be mentioned, and which are but indif
ferently organized on the side of the
working people, are dwindling."

AT THE PAN-AMERICAN
NEWPORT, R. 1*| Aug. 31.â The Co
lumbia, splendidly handled, beat the Con
stitution " to-day four - minutes nineteen
seconds, corrected time, over a course of
fifteen miles to windward and back, in
the first- trial races to select the cup de
fender.* The defeat -was decisive, and ad
mirers of the- Constitution N are at their
wits' end to make " apo'ogies \ and excuses
for her bad behavior. She was fresh from
the Herreshoff ship yard, where her bot
tom was burnished until it glistened like
plate glass 'Â¦ in the sunlight. Her sails
fitted her "admirably, with the exception
of the -balloon jib topsail, which she set
on" the homeward reach. She had no
drawback, to act as a detriment to; her
speed.-. Moreover, Nat Herreshoff, her de
signer and builder, was aboard. The Con
stitution was beaten fairly on her merits,
and unless she sails better on'Monday and
Wednesday the committee which has the
matter. In charge may decide upon select
ing the Columbia to meet the Shamrock
II. only possible excuse that the
backers of the Constitution have to offer
is that the Constitution got the worst of
the start, ibeing handicapped several sec
onds. This is quite true. , She got the
'. worst, of the start, because her skipper
was outgeneraled and outclassed. But
the few seconds she lost thus cannot by
any means be distorted to account for the
signal defeat administered to her by the
Columbia after the race was started as a
dead beat to windward, the course being
south-southeast, dead In the teeth of a
nine-knot breeze and in smooth water, the
very choicest weather for the Constitu
tion if she had been sailing up to her old
timÂ». form. The wind, however, hauled
so much to the eastward as to allow the
yachts to steer their course so that, as a
matter of fact, the dead beat resolved
itself into one long leg and a couple of
short hitches. The surprising part of the
race was the sagging off to leeward of the
Constitution when close hauled. In a
stiff breeze one might have expected to
see the Columbia beating her,' but in the
weather that prevailed to-day it was in
deed amazing to see the Constitution so
badly defeated.: The hauling of the wind
to the eastward of the course benefited
the Columbia slightly, as she was tho
leading yacht, but it cannot with any jus
tice be alleged that this was the real
cause of the Constitution's defeat.

:Â¦ fender Are Many and

Issued before then had it been possible to

President Shaffer, while declining to
discuss the matter, remained at his office
until a late hour to-night, and was much
occupied. Appearances indicated that he
was preparing for some important move
ment, but nothing could be learned ''from
him of the actual situation.
A telegram from Smithfield to-night
says: "The big steel strike has at last
affected the coke men, and as a result ;
orders have been received from head- 1
quarters for a wholesale banking of ovens
for this section of Clay County. The coke
oven men and miners here have been hav
ing prosperous times for a long time. The
miners have been averaging anywhere
' from S3 50 to $5 a day. while the coke
drawers have fared equally well. This
move will result in nearly 400 men being
forced into idleness, and many are now
leaving for other parts of the region. The
plants will work five days a week instead
of six, as has been the general run of
things for some time."

The subject of wireless telegraphy, as
bearing on naval progress, is treated at
length, and it is stated that â¢ great prog
ress has been made with this new means
of communication abroad during the past
year, particularly in increasing the dis
tance over which messages can be sent
and in providing means to guard against
confusion where messages cross one an
other. It is shown that the British.
French, German, Japanese, Russian, Ital
ian. Spanish and Swedish navies have
adopted wireless telegraphy to a greater
or les? extent.
A noteworthy statement is that the new-
German battle fleet will be practically
complete when the vessels laid down in
1905 are completed instead of in 1906, as
formerly proposed. "Vessels laid down aft
er 1905 will be either for foreign service or
the non-active fleet.'
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W\. WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.â Captain
Charles D. Sigsbee, chief of the office' of
Naval Intelligence, has made public that
bureau's annual publication entitled
"Notes on Naval Progress,"' which sets
forth in a comprehensive way the advance
that has been made in naval work among
the foreign navies.
It is learned to-night from reliable au
thority, in spite of the rigid secrecy
maintained by Burns and Shaffer con
cerning the telephonic conversation be
tween President Schwab and President
Burns, that something decisive may re
sult. It is said the President Schwab re
fused to hold any conference with Presi
dent Shaker, on the ground he no longer
represents any of the men employed by
the corporation. Immediately after this
conversation Burns went to President
Shaffer and urged him to call a meeting
of the executive board of the organization
at once, so that the men could be ordered
to work at the earliest moment possible.
It is believed this order will be issued not
later than Tuesday and would have been
Burns called on President Shaffer this
afternoon. He refused to state what
passed at the conference, but he Is horte
' ul that President Schwab will accord him
an interview to discuss the terms of
strike settlement. The future proposal
which it is said impresses the president
of the steel combine is putting the men
beck to work at once and then adjusting
any difficulties.
The steel corporation to-day continued
to add to the number of men at work In
.several of the plants that have resumed
sincf the strike began, but the Amalga
n.Â£ted people insist that the additions are
of no value, and that the strike situation
retrains without change. Neither side or
the controversy expects much to develop
until after Labor day outside of the Du
quesne probabilities. After Monday, how
ever, it is probable effective moves* will be
made by each.
Hopes for Conciliation.
It is learned from other sources that
during the extended^ wire conversation
Schwab told Burns-that he would.not con
sent to meet any representatives of the
Amalgamated Association until the mills
of the United States Steel Corporation
thrown idle by the order of President
Shaffer are put in operation again by the
former employes of the corporation re
turning to their work. He told Burns, It
is said, that the striking members of the
Amalgamated Association are no longer
employes of the United States Steel Corpo
ra tion. Hence there Is no reason why he
should meet any representative of the as
sociation. But if they voluntarily re
enter the employ of the corporation, it is
said, Schwab is willing to listen to any
grievance they may desire to lav before
him with reference to their work and
wages. And it is further intimated that
he will consent to allow these grievances
to be submitted by the officers of "their
union. Â» .
comment. It seems that the two men Teal
iy communicated with each other by tele
phone, but what the subject or result was
is not known. Burns is mysteriously
silent, and says he can say nothing just
yet.
Aside from the Duquense incident the
reported conference by long distance tele
phone between President Schwab of the
steel corporation and Simon Burns, presi
dent of the Window Glass Association,
was the only other happening to cause
Burns Talks to Schwab.
Until to-morrow night it will not be
known certainly which side is right in its
contention. The Amalgamated people
claim to be able to tie up tha. plant.' and
the steel company paople say that they
will resume without any material incon
venience.

The Amalgamated people claim that the
open hearth people have struck and that
the entire plant will have to close if the
men fail to return to work Sunday.
The Carnegie steel people make light of
the matter, and say the closing of *he
open hearth department to-day was mere
ly the usual Saturday afternoon close.
They maintain that j the men will be on
hand for work Sunday evening ai~hereto- ;
fore, and that no stoppage will result.
They say the trouble at the plant Friday
night has been .exaggerated very much;
that instead of a large number of men
having quit work, only a few boys were
escorted from the mill by policemen and
that the places of the ejected were filled
at once."

In France an important experiment is
about to be launched. The Government
ls about to establish"^ pension system
for the benefit of workingmen. A work
ingman's pension fund Is to be created by
taxation, or compulsory contribution, as
it is called. It is estimated that it will
attain the proportions of $2,400,000,00). The
Interest will be used ln payment of pen
sions to aged and disabled workingmen.
Pending the full development of the fund
the Government will appropriate funds to
meet the payments. The interest rate
on which the scheme is predicated is V.<x.
per cent, but -when the Interest on Gov
ernment securities falls below that figure
the Government will appropriate enough
to make up the deficiency. If the rate
falls as low as 2 per cent the Government
will be called on to pay $33,000,000 an
nually, whereas, if the rate keeps up to
3% per cent the fund will realize enough
for the payment of the pensions. It is
a gigantic -undertaking and as an experi
ment It will be watched with the greatest
interest by the people of all other lands. â

authors., "-The authors' discount was 50 per
cent off likewise.' The humorist finally
vouchsafed the information that he was
a particular friend of the proprietor of
the establishment, and this secured him
a reduction of. 25 per cent. Twain took

The Imeretinskys are a branch of the
princely family of- the Bagratian, which
claims that it can trace its ancestry up
to the great Jewish ruler. Among others
the ' Byzantine Emperor, Constantin Por
phyrogeneta, in his annals, has refcognized
the claim. of this family to a Davidic de
scent.. It Is noteworthy that the book
which in Russia occupies the position held
by the 'Almanach de Gotha' In Central
Europe, namely, the 'Annuaire de la Nob
lesse de Russie contenant les Princes de
l'Empire,* and printed by the Imperial
Publication house In St. Petersburg, gives
a most complete account of the Jewish
origin and descent of the princes of the
houses of Bagratian and Imeretlnsky, and
emphasizes tke fact that not a single sov
ereign dynasty ln Europe can trace its
line. farther back than they. It is a fact
that in the genealogy of this family the
name of David often occurs, David I hav
ing died in 881. The ' members of this
family in the 'Annuaire' acknowledge that
originally they were of Jewish origin, but
that generations ago the persecutions of
the times had compelled their ancestors
to embrace the Christian religion. Ic is
further known that members of this
princely family as early as the fifteenth
century were monks."
It is conceivable that the "Zionist move
ment would receive much strength,
through added enthusiasm, if a prince of
the house of David should appear at the
right moment and identify himself with'
it. The history of Israel centers around
that royal house, and the forecasts for
the future give prominence to the role
still reserved for Its descendants.â Pioneer

logicum then beginning to run Its course
in Beam, or by reason of some other con
temporary social agency, blasphemers
who offended twice had their tongues
pierced, were flogged the third time and
on the fourth occasion punished with
death. 'As 1 an { example of Â¦ the growing

A new rule of considerable importance
has lately been made by -the Navy De
partment whereby graduates of the Naval
Academy selected for â¢ appointment in the
construction corps will receive a finishing
course of study at the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, instead of being
sent to the schools of naval architecture
at Glasgow or Paris. These institutions
have declined to take any more gradu
ates of the American Naval Academy, but
It is now believed their education can be
finished Just as well at home. Those
selected are honor men . of the academy
who graduate highest, and an appoint
ment to the construction corps Is a dis
tinction very similar to that conferred
upon a West Pointer who, on graduating,
is assigned to the corps of engineers. In
each case the honor has been fairly
earned. Under the new system the high
standard will be fully maintained, and no
man who Is not entirely competent for
the duties to be performed will receive a

To two-thirds of the Senators the annual
salary of $3000 is a consideration not to be
despised. There are few perquisites to eVe
out this comparatively meager compensa
tionânone, in fact, worth mentioning. The
Government provides one or two clerks to
attend to the Senator's correspondence,
which is always heavy; It allows a mini
mum of free s-tationery, and It returns
some of his traveling expenses.
There is opportunity, of pourse, to make
money through speculation, and some Sen
ators avail themselves of it. One Senator
who was a large holder, of Washington
real estate, increased its value very ma

improvements in its direction, while every
manipulation of tariff schedules and of

and iron, tobacco, whisky and sugar, re

to the few Senators who are noted for
their commercial instincts. The majority
of Senators do not speculate. They con
tent themselves with their modest salary,
and how they manage to live upon it Is a
daily wonder. The time doesn't seem far
distant when the Senate of the United
States will be composed In large degree
of rich men, simply because a poor man
cannot afford to accept the position.
It is to the credit of the Senate that
wealth Is not yet the standard by which
its members Judge each other. A man can
not rise to eminence in the Senate by
wealth alone. Herein it seems Is much
basis for felicitation. Until this condition
changes the Senate will continue to be
what It is to-dayâ the greatest legislative
body In the world.â The Forum.

The papers take an amused view' of
Prince Chung waiting at the frontier for
the settlement of the question as to the
number of bows he must make before the
Emperor. It Is generally expected now
that Prince Chung will stay a long while
at Basle. The Lokal Anzeiger's Basle
correspondent discovered that Prince
Chungs immense trunks were removed
only yesterday from the baggage car to
the hotel. Four enormous trunks covered
with yellow silk attracted attention. The
special car placed at Prince Chung's dis
posal is the car used by Count von Bulow
and the Crown Prince.
The Kreuz Zeitung regards It as but
natural that the better classes in South
American states should long for the
Vnited Btates to take hold, introduce
order and suppress anarchy. It admits
that this would be a great advantage to
those countries, "but it would make the
Vnited States' economic position impreg
nable and Europe would be practically
ruined."
Predicts Huin for Europe.
The South American trouble is not much
discussed, but when it Is commented on
it is in a sense unfavorable to the United
Slates, which is represented as playing the
role cf a general plotter in South America.
The Cologne Zeitung charges the Wash
ington Government with duplicity in pre
tending not to have a clear view of the
situation and assumes the administration
is intriguing everywhere.
The Chamber of Commerce and scien
tific bodies continue to pa=s resolutions
against the tariff bill.. The Berlin Cham
ber has issued a long resolution against
it. The manufacturers in the vicinity ot
Eayreuth have resolved to make a united
demonstration against the tariff bill. The
Luedensche Chamber has appealed to
Herr Moehler, the Minister of Commerce,
against the tariff bill as being a. desertion
of the commercial treaty policy. The
Kreuz Zeitung, Conservative, continues
arguing for a reciprocity arrangement
with the United States. It says:
"Germany would place herself In an Im
possible position by making- commercial
treaties with other countries and giving
them reductions from the general tariff
while refusing the same reductions to the
Vnited States, because the United States
would probably answer any differential
treatment of her products with the sharp-
BEt retaliatory measures. Germany should
avoid treating- American goods differen
tially and more unfavorably than any
othe'r countries and avoid a tariff war.
Kffective measures against the American
danger are only possible when several of
the great European States become cctn
*Â¦' ious of the common danger. Until then
interests lie in peaceful com
mercial treaties with the United States."
Objections to Tariff Bill.
Herr Herold. a member of the Reichstag,
in favor of fixing- minimal grain duties,
end a resolution to that effect was accord
ingly passed. The Post, Conservative,
concludes that this assures the adoption
of the minimal system by the Reichstag.
The letter Is generally interpreted as a
reflection upon the Emperor, who tooK
too active an interest in the selections
mentioned. The Germanla, a Catholic
organ of Berlin, hails the letter as con
lirming its own criticisms of the Prussian
Government In the selection of bishops,
and the Tageblatt (Independent Liberal)
comments on the letter aggressively, ask
ing whether thÂ£ letter shall usher in a
new Kulturkampf. The National Zeitung
(National Liberal) contests the view that
the Government has only the veto right
in the selection of bishops, especially in
the Reichsland. and claims that the ap
pointments at Metz and Strasburg were
made by the Pope, upen the Emperor s
wish, showing that the Pontiff recognizes
"his Majesty's rights in the matter.
The week was marked by an active dis
cussion of the tariff. The most significant
thing is the growing feud between the
y>ntral Verbund and. the Husbandlsts,
jtvho now begin to hurl epithets at each
c:her. The Husbandisfs correspondent
describes the Central Verbund's recent
declaration against a minimum tariff on
grain as a disgraceful betrayal of agri
culture, adding, "The Central Verbund's
action is premeditated treason toward ag
riculture." The Berlin Neueste Nachrich
ten. Conservative, which is friendly to the
Central Verbund, says, "This silly effu
sion does not deserve a reply.' The
Tageblatt hails the quarrel as meaning' a
dissolution of the alliance between the
agrarians and the manufacturers. "
One of the leading features of the meet
ing of the Catholic Diet was a speech by
The Cologne Zeitung admits that the
appointments give much dissatisfaction in
the Reichsland. In connection with the
sipointments a letter of Cardinal Ram
polla, the Papal Secretary of State, has
been published and widely commented on.
The letter is addressed to the Prussian
Catholic Chapters, defining the rights of
the Papal See and the German Govern
ment in the selection of bishops, the latter
having merely the right to vote ana not
to make positive proposals.
Reflections on the Emperor.
Another Catholic matter occupying at
tention Is the final settlement of the
bishoprics In the Relchsland, by the ap
pointment of the Abbot of Maria-laach,
Dr. Bender, as Bishop of Metz and Dr.
Zorn von Bulach as Consecratory Bishop
of Strasburg-.
BERLIN', Aug. 3Lâ The annual Catholic
Diet at Osnabruck this week attracted
ttnusual attention and newspaper discus
sion. The attendance was very large and
the enthusiasm was great, although the
speeches were of a controversial char-,
acter. A remark of President Trimbon.
who is a prominent member of the Reich
stag, that a new Kulturkampf was about
beginning, was much applauded and
Â¦widely discussed editorially. The Cologne
Volks Zeitung (a leading Centrist organ)
sees in this expression the chief merit of
the annual diet and says the announce
ment thus made Is sure to awaken an
echo. The newspapers confine themselves
chiefly to the political aspects of the
questions, in expectation of a period of
greater activity on the part of the Cen
y--.rists, with sharper controversies over all
y matters discussed.

COMPLAINT is made that the Atlantic Ocean trade is at a standstill, and ships are
idle in the harbors of that side .for lack of cargoes.
This, means that ! Europe is gorged with our goods . for. the present, and trade
..must wait for consumption to catch up with the supply. None can tell how long-the
wait may be. If greatly prolonged it may produce stagnation of trade and bring about some
of the effects of a panic. . ; - f
While this is the condition of deep-water commerce on the Atlantic side, on the Pacific
there is no evidence of' decline. Even, in spite of the efforts ofjthe strikers ""who criminally, inter

going Oriental and Australasian ships carry full â¢ cargoes and return laden to their capacity.- Our

Europe, and it is probable that the season's statistics will show a steady growth of that com

gramme for the evening's entejtainmen
The coming week at the Tivoli will see
the revival of one of the .two most impor
tant of the Bellini .operas, to wit. "Nor
ma," a work comparatively seldom heard
here owing, perhaps,- to the exacting na
ture of the title role. Barbareschi is cast
for the part that I understand is a par
ticular favorite witlAhe pleasing singer,
and one that certainly affords opportunity
fdr her marked dramatic power. Pole
tinl's pleasant and comfortably sure con
tralto will be heard in the part of Adal
gisa, Castellano assumes the roIeof^Pol
lio arid Dado is cast as the archdruid,
with any number of fine bass arias to in
terpret. The "Casta Diva" is something
to look forward to, also.
In the alternating bill, "Mignon," one
of the prettiest things will be Repetto's
Filina. I at least like it better than any
thing else she, does. Repetto's dramatic
line is dainty comedy, and as hopelessly
ineffective as her Lucia is from fltie
histrionic standpoint, so is her Filina \n
delicately charming. It is instinct >with
the very spirit of patched and powdered
coquetry, â¢ and the little Â¦ singer looks like
a rare bit of Dresden china to add, im
portantly, to the effect. -I have not heard
Coilamarinrs Mignon, but it is said to
be one of heT best efforts. Poletini, who
gave us a charming Mignon last year,
is to sing the part of Frederick; with its
ever-popular "Gavotte"; Russo will ap
pear as last year In Wilhelm Meister's
part, and Nicollnl will also repeat his
good work of last year as Lothario.
There will be a small concert given In
Oakland next week (September 10) at the
Unitarian church that is deserving of
favorable attention. in that it Is the first
public effort of a new trio, consisting of
Miss Helen J. Hagar, pianist; John . R.
Lewlai violinist, and Lovell Langstroth,
'cellist. The last-named musician has
but lately returned from Brussels, where
he has 'studied to -good purpose under
Jacobs,- the famous- 'cellist, and heis^a
young, player of, whom almost anything
may be prophesied. ' The. young artist has
played almost all his life, first under the
tutelage of his father, J. A. Langstroth:
then with Loufs Heine; of most musical
memory,- and then with Fred Gutterson,
th-> Tivoli's clever 'cellist.^-. Mr. Langs
troth had a good technique when he -left
here, but both, technique and musical
spirit. have grown and deepened wonder
fully since his . European . experiences,
among which were, a couple of seasons
with the famous Ysaye orchestra."* The
young Oaklander also had the honor of
instructing Cesar Thomson's- .daughter
and frequently playing in--trio- with the
celebrated' violinist himself. V
Mr. ' Langstroth ..will , have one 'of the
most beautiful r instruments to. play, on
that has'ever been heard. here, a Stradi
varius of -simply gorgeous tone, that does
not yet belong to him, mofe's the pity. I
understand its owner ,w.ould consider $3500
for the cello. Miss Hagar.is a s well-known
pianist In Oakland 'musical circles and is.
a. thoroughly' capable 'and earnest musi

TO old and young playgoers alike,
indeed to every generation of play
goers that can be represented in
an audience, the appearance of the
venerable actress Mrs. G. H. Gil
bert this week at the Columbia is an
event of supreme Interest. I had the
pleasure of meeting her on her arrival
during the week and of satisfying myself
that she looks hardly' a day older than
on her last appearance here with ; the
Daly company at the Baldwin Theater.
Such a dear, fragile, nervous little figure
she is, with only the sparkle in the still
bright eyes to tell of the marvelous vigor
that has carried her through her brilliant
long life on the boards. Mrs. Gilbert is
unmistakably of the gracious yesterday.
She has the gently courteous and leisurely
air of the day when there was time to
do' all things needful, and time to do them
well. She has the manner of the ideal
Duchessâ or Queen Dowager, as she will
be this weekâ that is, exactly the manner
highnesses should have, but commonly
don't. I do not think the modern regime
can be quite to Mrs. Gilbert's liking. The
Sunday performance, the Sunday rehear
sal, are quite out of her repertoire; the
problem play she dislikesâ including "Mrs.
Dane's Defence" and such; the modern
novel with- its intimate handling of the
relations of men and . women she consid
ers superfluous ' and so on, and one is
persuaded to the gentle old lady's belief
in seeing her, the exquisite product of
those days when these were not. Her
opinions of actors and acting, on. the
other hand, are characterized by the ut
>most modernity of judgment, and she v
has kepc wonderfully in touch with what
actor- folk are doing and -playwrights writ
ing. ;
."I can do everything T used to do," she
said quaintly, "but not quite, so much of
it."
| Mrs. Gilbert Â«ppear3 this time as sup
port to the charming young actress Annie
Russell, in R. Marshall's romance, "A
Royal Family.'' She has the part of the
Queen Dowager,. and expresses the utmost
content with the role, and the play, and
her young friend Miss Russell, with
whom she has been associated for some
seasons.' She hopes we shall like the play
as well as she likes it, but, be that as it
may. there is enly on.o greeting for Mrs.
Gilbert, and that is "heartiest welcome to
San Francisco."' ."
â¢ * - Â«
With the premiere of "A Voice in the
Wilderness,'.* the big venture of Belasco
& Thall at the Central v Theater; with An
nie Russell, Mrs. G. H. Gilbert and ' a
host of clever players at the Columbia
Theater in "A Royal Family"; with Jo
seph Haworth and -the new. stock com
pany at the Grand Opera-House, and an
Oscar Wilde play, "An Ideal Husband,"
at the California, there should be little
reason to complain of the theatrical menu
for the coming week. â¢
It appears that the Grand Opera-House
management found the "star, and stock"
system so profitablex^uring the late reign
of Mr. Melbourne MacDowell that it has
been adopted as the regular, policy of the
house. Mr. Haworth is MacDowell's suc
ceeding star, and will begin a six weeks'
engagement to-morrow, evening with
"Roscdale." Joseph Haworth made his
last appearance here with Mod Jeska at
the Baldwin Theater some five years ago,
and has been starring in . the East I since
that time in "The Ghetto."" VThe Chris
tian" (as John Storm). "Quo Vadla" (as
Vinicius) and . others. Next week he will
appear - in the last named < play, and
"Richelieu" will follow.
One of thejinost. creditable amateur the
atrical, performances that have been seen
hereabouts for a long time; was . one given
on last s Friday . and Â¦ Saturday ' nights .'at
San Rafael in -the* Gordon Opera-house
The ; play wa3 VE3meralda," the old"ro
mance by.-Frances Hodgson Burnett and
W. H.vGillette, and the talent employed
was all local. The affair was under the
direction of Miss Grace Fern, reader and
impersonator, and bore strong testimony
to the young lady's unusual gifts as stage
manager, and the quite uncommonly good
material she has had to work with.
It will be remembered that one of the
chief characters In the play is old man
Rogers, an old farmer, very well content
ed with the smallest 'of incomes and
"North Carliny ways." and' saddled with
a wife whose ambitions make his and
his daughter's lives miserable. F. J.
Crowley, in private life a lawyer of prom
inence, was cast for this' part and gave
a rendering of it that for truth, restraint
and fine artistic feeling could hardly have
been bettered by any but the best actors
on the professional stage. Given the ex
perience, it is quite certain that Mr.
Crowley, In such roles as Jefferson played,
or dramas of the James A. Hfrne kind,
could have taken a very high position in
deed among the actors of the day.
Another very well assumed character
was that of Lydia Ann Rogers, that was
acted by Mrs. Renebome. who gave the
scheming, shrewish wife's part with
much power. Dave Hardy, the lover, and
a rather ungratefur-role, was played with
sympathy and refinement by Mr. Halley,
who also shows a considerable histrionic
ability, and Mr. Lestretto appeared as the
Marquis de Montessan, giving an'excel
lent interpretation of the character. In
the cast, too, was Colonel Shakespeare, a
direct descendant of the playwright of
Avon, and also, courageously, like him a
maker of plays. The Colonel was seen as
Jack Desmond, and played his part In
modest and manly fashion.
Master John Verdenal gave an amus
ingly good sketch of the American specu
lator, Mr. Short was sufficient as Esta
brook, and the two nieces of Jack Des
mond were well played by Jlisa Bowne
and Miss Mamie Bowne. Throughout
there was a .wholesome familiarity with
the lines, and Miss Fern 13 to be highly
praised for her clever work with the
amateur actors.
Miss Fern herself appeared to much
advantage In the name role, particularly
in those parts of the play requiring deep
er emotion. She is evidently naturally
fitted for stage work, being gifted with
temperament, dramatic feeling, a charm-
Ing face and figure and a very pleasing
voice. It is on the cards that the ama
teur players may take their play to some
of the smaller coast town, and any en
terprising charity In need of; assistance
would do well to ask their aid.
THE Incidental mus^c of "A Voice
in the Wilderness," the new bibli
cal drama at the Central Theater
this week, will be of special in
terest. Mr. Louis Homeier, the
leader of the Central orchestra, is the
composer and seems to have evolved
something at once original and in good
keeping with the spirit of the drama.
This is by no means Mr. Homeler's first
work of Â«the kind, by the way. He wrote
the incidental music to "King Lear',' and
"Louis- XI" for W: E. Sheridan, and is
also the composer of a number of re
ligious works, notably a fine . "Salutaris"
and several offertories. To Mr. Homeier
is also owing the first introduction of
"VVagnerian music to San Francisco, in
1SS2, at Piatt's Hall, where he gave a
series of concerts with a fine orchestra
of forty musical enthusiasts. The ac
companying and illustrative music of "A
Voice in the Wilderness," therefore,
Eoems to be in good hands, and the few
strains I have heard will certainly add
interest to the performance, the "Hero
dias Barbaric March" and the "Anthem
Superna," more particularly.
One violinist and two harpists Is the
curious combination of the Vailee trio of
women players that will be ane of the
week's musical numbers at the Orpheum.
The combination sounds perhaps more
curious than beautiful, but the trio has
been something of a rage in the East, and
whether musical or novel remains to be
seen.
Miss Lucille Saunders, the - contralto
who has made so favorable an impression
with Orpheum audiences, is to be heard
again this wcek-in some new; ballads. Miss
Saunders is very well worth listening to
from a conversational as well as vocal
standpoint. She has had a varied experi
ence on the operatic stage both in Eng
land and America, and has much pic
turesque gossip about it that she retails
in a very pleasing voice and fetching
fashion. Miss Saunders was a pupil of
the celebrated Mme. Lagrange in Paris,
where she studied for three years. She
made her debut with the famous Carl
Rosa Opera Company, then at the height
of its Teputatlon. and sang â¢ the three
parts of Frederick, Siebelâ I am not sure
ot the thirdâ all In h,e.r. first , W eek. â¢ She
has interesting stories of W. S. Gilbert,
to tell, with whom she spent a happy
season or two at the Savoy Theater, and
to whom she gives any credit due to her
for her exceptionally, good enunciation,
Gilbert having told her. one 3ay at re
hearsal, J.o her profound embarrassment,
that her work might be good. If anybody
only could tell what she ' was w singing
about! Since that lime : she- has taken
care they shall. Her . later - work Â¦ in
America with the . Metropolitan â¢ Opera
Company is too recent to need resurrec

It gives me pleasure to announce the re
turn of lime. Julie Rosewald to the. city
after an absence , of four years.. It will
be gratefully remembered by many prom
inent singers that this once famous so
prano of the Henry Abbott grand opera
company was for eight years one of the
foremost vocal teachers in San Francisco,
and it will be good news to the . vocally
inclined 'to know that she will again, re

THE Examiner varies its vile attacks upon the police by crying out for the .right of
labor to combine as an offset to the â¢ incorporation of capital. ,â¢;* .... ,
It surrenders its own editorial space to the reproduction of an expression fronvan
Â¦--.other paper, on that subject, of which' it seems to consider the. following sentence to be
the.pith.of the whole subject, for it lavishes : black letter.. type upon it: T : "Â£ . l â¢ ; Â¦
"It is primarily important, in order- to obtain clear views of the existing situation, to em
phasize the statement that -labor unions possess a. legitimacy equal to the right of incorporation
for the purpose. of conducting business, and that, in common with all other associated 'â¢/effort
among men, have their foundations laid deeply in the inherent right. of man .to. enter into, asso
ciated relation for the accomplishment of legitimate purposes. Whoever denies this right is
either guided by a very enfeebled intelligence or prompted by motives as base as those which he,
at the foundation of all tyranny."- . / ':
It' would be rather amusing to see the Examiner try -to find any one who denies to labpr
the right of combination. Certainly it is not the Employers' Association, nor. the corporations,
nor the individual employers. -No n one is disputing the. right of labor Organizationâ that- is not
in issue at allâ and the fire-eating leaders and their organ are simply 'deceiving labor, to its
great injury, by a brazen pretense that such is the issue.
â¢ The v issue is the equality of responsibility between capital and labor in their organized
form. "Incorporation for the purpose of conducting business," being' confessed by the; Exam
iner to be the same as the organization of labor into unions, let the- responsibility be made the
same. At present, the union has no. legal status. " It can neither sue nor be sued. It may inflict
ruin -upon individuals, set the law. at defiance by violence, blockade trade, destroy the prosperity
of a community, and^finally bring its own members to .beggary and want, and not be compelled
to respond in "damages. It claims, the right to exercise the powers of government, and to do
things that a pnly the executors of the lawcan do and some they cannot do. Yet it / is without
status, and though an organization is an, incorporeal .body. It is as completely subject to the will
of one man as are the people of an Oriental autocracy. This man orders the union to break con
tracts and they are broken. If the court seeks to enforce these contracts, there is no legal en
tity against which to proceed. The Examiner indorses these breaches of. contract by command of
union leaders, but if the employers or corporations had broken the same contract it would be out
employing special counsel and taking the employer or corporation into court for punishment and
the exaction of damages. Sensible laboring. men must see that public opinion will not indorse
the position that unions have a right to break contracts, and also the power to punish employers
for the same act. â¢ Â¦ Â¦â¢'.â¢;Â¦Â¦
This serious phase of the present labor troubles here and in the East is impressing such
thinking men in the unions as have not completely .abdicated their rights- as Â¦freemen in 'favor of
their leaders. The. Labor World, published in Pittsburg as the organ of. the International Tin-
Workers' Protective Association, and the Pittsburg District Mine-Workers' Union, , and "the, Pat- .
tern-Makers' Association, all of which' unions are affected by the; strike ordered by President
Shaffer of the Amalgamated Steel. Association, does not agree with the Examiner that.it is'.right
and honorable for a union to break a contract at the command of a leader. The World says that x
to get the strike at all Shaffer had to compel the unions to break contracts that they Jiad -.made
with their employers, that were entirely, satisfactory to the laborers, and that for this compulsion
to a dishonorable act he should be impeached. That labor organ accuses. him of tyranny in pun
ishing the unions ill the Western steel mills because they kept their contracts inviolate. -and re
fused to strike. Among the twenty-four counts in its indictment of he is' accused of,,
bringing wreck and ruin to the men whom he forced into dishonor and^ idleness. -.'
That is the outcry of labor against its own degradation by the tyranny of its leader. It is
the voice of union labor in distress caused by the irresponsibility of, labor organizations. Let thej
laboring men themselves insist that their unions have the same legal status as incorporated cap^
ital. Then their leaders become legal trustees of their affairs, and for such malfeasance as is
charged. against. Shaffer and. ?is has been committed here by irresponsible leaders, any member of
a union, can resort to a court and punish his trustees for injuring him.
Let it be understood that menxan combine for any purpose, without special permit of the
law, so long as that purpose affects them alone. But when the purpose affects others, and the
combination assumes to' make and break contracts, to deny to men their lawful right to labor
peaceably for the support of their families, the combination .becomes an -outlaw. To make it
plain, no public officer, deriving his authority from this city, the State, or the United States, dare
interfere with the humblest citizen to. deny or; impede him in his labor or his freedom of con
tract. This high function denied by the law to its own officers is being hourly exercised in this
city by the labor unions. They stone and shoot at citizens of the United States who are peace
fully laboring. They fire on .teams, teamsters and barns full cf horses' arid their keepers. They
violate the maritime laws of the United* States by boarding ships in the harbor and making" pris
oners of their crews, taking them ashore, Â¦compelling them under threat of death; to swear allegi
ance to the union, and then beating them into insensibility. They are exercising authority which
Government dare not, and the Examiner scales thesublimest eminence of lying by the pretense
that those who object to this are opposed to the right of labor to combine! .

The Sonora Union-Democrat has been
Informed by J. W. Pownall, the man

Electric Power Company, that the water
supply is ample for mining purposes for
the present and' that there will be no
diminishment earlier than September 2a,
and probably not until October. Then
the supply will be limited, but it Is not
expected to fall entirely at any time dur

active operation at the Goldwin j mine,
says the Union-Democrat, although the
water is running so low in the river that
It is feared that the mill will have to

"There is more activity in mining cir

Stockton Independent, "than there has
been In years. It is believed . that by next
winter more mines will be worked than at
any time since the first rush to that dis
trict In the '40s and '60s. Old claims that
have been idle for years are being cleaned

Morton Lindley has concluded a deal, so
reports the Redding Free Press, by which
his company secures the Keith group of
copper claims, which will soon be devel

Shasta copper fields of the May Blossom
Copper Company, which is composed of
men from the Granite Creek Smelting and
Refilling Company of Boston. The Keith
group of claims lies about half a mile
northeast from the Bully Hill mine. The
claims were taken up several years ago,
but little work was done.
Mining: in Tulare County commenced when
the great rush and excitement was made over
the discovery of gold in the bars of Kern
River in the year 1853 upon the Elbow bar. At
that time Tulare County included Kern River.
The bars upon the river never proved very
rich, .but the placer ground of Green Horn
Gulch was very rich, as much as $50 to the
pan having been taken from some of the
rorges. There were also several gulches near
Keysville, French Gulch and Rich Gulch that
yielded thousands of dollars. Quartz mining
soon followed. The first quartz mine, the
Brother Jonathan, was discovered by Colonel
Richard Keys and worked by him for several
years and the ore worked in arrastras yielded
$100 per ton. The town of. Keysville was named
after him. Mining In Tulare County as it is
now began upon this side of the Sierra Mount
ains in the year 1851 by the discovery of a rich
quartz lode upon the south fork of White
River by Robert McCullough and Damon A.
Bullock. The ore yielded as much as $250 to
the ton in arrastras. This discovery led to
many others, prominent among which were tho
Eclipse No. 1 and the Eclipse No. 2, both of
which were worked by A. J. Maltby. The
Josephine, another rich mine, was opened by
John I>. Murphy and managed by David B.
James, who opened the mine and erected a mill
upon it. This mine produced with a very small
mill $10,000 per month and was sold afterward
to General George W. Gashwller, Mr. Birdseye,
John Henning and others.

the Brown people. The Riverside mine in
Tuolumne County will soon resume op
erations with a large force of men. The
Union-Democrat says that work will be
confined to the two which are
now in respectively 900 and 2400 feet. The
ore is of low grade, but it is abundant.
The Western Mining World Â«Â»ets the
matter about right when it claims that
relatively only a small part of the mineral
realm of the West has been subjected to
thorough prospecting, and this portion is
well known through its gTeat producing
properties.. The greater part of the min
eral lands is almost unknown as regards
its true merit, having been subjected only
to the primary prospecting of the ex
plorer, and there is much virgin territory.
Many new mineral zones and districts
will be opened up by scientific men.

A recent report of the secretary oÂ£ the
Continental shows that this institution
rests upon an exceedingly firm founda
tion. - Its stock amounts to $12,012,000.
Last year the company erected 156 dwell
ings, making a total of 850 in seven
vears. The statement of assets and lia
bilities of the Continental on July 1, 1901,
was as follows:
Next to the legacy of a good and hon
ored name that of the legacy of a home
to a family is perhaps the best. The only
way to secure a home, unless one is well
provided with money, is by the aid of the
building and loan associations. These
institutions, when conducted, according to
business principles, have been the salva
tion in a temporal sense of thousands of
residents of California. Among the insti
tutions of this class whose fame extends
over the coast, none is better or more
favorably known, than the Continental
Building and Loan Association of this
city. In the past seven years the Conti
nental has assisted 850 of its stockholders
in San Francisco to build their homes.
To these the thought of home, where
contented wives and romping children
find refuge against the chill blasts of ad
versity, is a source of unalloyed happi
ness. To them the complaint of the or
dinary renter that the building of a
home by the installment plan is a "re
sponsibility" which careful men should
shun as a frightful danger, is> absolutely
meaningless. Their homes paid for after
a few years of thrift, they are in a posi
tion ,to enjoy the comforts of life, while
the renter who declined to accept the
"responsibility" of paying a stipulated
monthly sum to the Continental for a
term of years still continues to pay rent
without being able to show anything as
the fruit of years of labor. To this un
fortunate man who has let the eojden op
portunity slip, there is little save 1 annoy
ance, vexation- and trouble in* store, and
when he is overtaken by sickness, unable
to pay his rent, then comes the crowning
shame and agonyâ eviction.
To the earnest wage earner whose- love
for hjs family is the all-pervading senti
ment of his existence, the question of a
home is of paramount importance. Plow
to secure a home on the easiest terms in
order to avoid the payment of rent and
to place his loved ones 'beneath a shel
tering roof from whence they can never
be evicted because of non-payment of a
monthly tribute to the landlord, are con
siderations which demand the attention
of every thoughtful man of, family.

An extract from. an exhaustive article is
as follows: :
The real estate experts consider that there
is at hand a real estate â¢' movement that has
not bsfin equaled since the early seventies,
when New York went' mad on the subject of
land on Manhattan Island. The fever of the
seventies was largely due to the extensive pub
lic Improvements projected and begun . by the
Tweed regime in the'way ot public parks and
boulevards. The spirit of that time was largely
of a boom character on a grand scale and when
the financial crash came the boom prices suf
fered the reaction that might have been .ex
pected as a result of over speculation. , . %
The New York Herald says that, the
coming, fall promises to -be one of 'the
liveliest in the,Mstory of New York in the
realty market. This activity began a year
ago, and the present month of September
is eagerly looked to by the brokers. The
Herald says: ...

Several years ago the Baxter family
from Cheyenne acquired the handsome
house just adjoining the Hughes' ; brown
stone mansion. Cornelia was a mere girl
In years then and wore short dresses. She
and Gerald Hughes were drawn into each
other's company a great deal. The an
nouncement of their engagement was re
ceived with applause by society. Then
came the jilting, the marriage to Tevis
and .Â¦ the death of the millionaire. Now
Gerald Hughes has bought the Denver
home of his- former sweetheart and it is
for sale to any one except the Baxters
at the price paid for it recently by the
young lawyer.
The Baxters are leaving Denver, It is
openly said, because of its social frigidity,
because of the silent boycott of Gerald
Hughes and his many warm friends. But
it Is equally certain that ex-Governor
Baxter would have never sold his beauti
ful home if he had known that Gerald
Hughes was . the purchaser. When he
transferred it to Tyson Dines last week
for a consideration of $40,000 he supposed
he had sold it to Mr. Dines for a home.
He did not know that Dines had a com
mission from young Gerald Hughes,
backed up with $100,000 in cash, to buy the
Baxter home at any price. The dally
sight of the Baxters so close to his own
home was unpleasant to him. He de
termined to buy the Baxter house to cst
rid of the family. He has a fortune of
his own and he placed $100,000 of it In the
hands of the Porter Investment Company,
to use as needed for the purchase of the
Baxter family's home. He did not buy It
for an investment and certainly not to
live in himself. He just bought it because
the Baxter home was too close to his own.
Society people in Denver who knew all
about the -love' affair between young
Hughes arid the then Miss Cornelia Bax
ter said the jilting was all because Hugh
Tevis was supposed to be several times
a millionaire while the amount of C. J.
Hughes' fortune was not known. Of late
it has transpired that C. J. Hughes Jr.,
instead of being worth only a paltry half
million, increased his fortune a million
and a half or more last year in mining
Investments. '
DENVER, Augr. 31.â Gerald Hughes, con
of C. J. Hughes Jr., has purchased the
home of the Baxters. Mrs. Cornelia Bax

â¢thorityâhe Is now estopped frbm appealing to
any other tribunal than those sanctioned by
I the laws and usages of war. To avoid this
conclusion the accused claimed that he was
dealing with a de facto insurgent government
and had a right, and by Implication was mor
ally bound to pay the taxes it imposid upon
interisland traffic. . /
Neither did , he lack the hardihood to as
sume the responsibility foj the arrangement
of the bales of stores in his warehouse in
available form \ as a barricade, but flinching
from tills ultimate responsibility, he denied
all knowledge of the purpose manifestly in
tended.
Haelterman was . In the employ of the
Philippine Trading Company. He was In
charge of a storehouse and violated the
laws of war by. piling in the storehouse,
which was constructed of nipa and bam
boo, sacks of copra or other material in
such a manner as to form a breastwork
of proper height to be used by Filipinos,
ana so constructed as to afford protection
against any rifle shots which might be di
rected against it from the position occu
pied by the troops of the Uniced States.
It also afforded protection from any rifle
fire which might be directed upon It from
the road between Calauan and Bay. anu
afforded a position from which an enfl
filade fire might be directed upon a certain
ditch toward the south of the quarters oc
cupied by the troops, and also afforded a
position from which fire miÂ«rht be directed
against the quarters occupied by the
troops, the front of the quarters or the
road or street in front of the quarters.
As a Belgian citizen Haelterman was
looked upon as neutral, and took advant
age of the freedom from espionage which
his position afforded. He made several trip3
to the camps of the Filipinos and on each
trip carried with him various sums of
money which he turned over to the in
surgent leaders. A complete record of the
moneys which he gave the insurrectos as
well as of the provisions which he gave
them from time to time was found in hi3
effects at the time of his capture, in ad
dition to a great deal of other incriminat
ing evidence. .. â¢
In reviewing the proceedings of the com
mission Brigadier General Barry said in
his official report:
The military commission which convened
at Manila on October 31, 1900, and was. in
session until a few days ago, convicted
Brix Haelterman, a Belgian, of "relieving
the enemy with money and victuals, har
boring an enemy and violation of. the laws
of war." The commission sentenced him
to be hanged, but the sentence has. been
commuted to confinement at hard labor
for r fifteen years. '. ': Â¦

Disorders of Men

A Damaged Prostate
As a factor in 50=caIIed "Weakness"
Cannot be too highly emphasized
Assuming that the functions of the Prostate Gland, so called neck of the
bladder, are understood, it should be apparent that when damaged through
lor.p continued and too often repeated excitement or contracted diseases, that
disordered function must result. The first symptoms pointing to this pro'static
disorder are referable to the reproductive system. It Is first noticed that
patients suffering from this disease are embarrassed by Prematureness. This
is invariably followed, sooner or later,, by less of vitality and power, together
With all Those symptoms, known as "Weakness." The most common form of
damage to the jdand is congestion, of more or less severity, which finally
becomes localized as prostatic catarrh, and if "this catarrh once becomes
chronic, then various nervous symptoms arise, which are known to phy-
r'cians as Neurasthenia, or exhausted nerve force. The greater number of
patients suffering from this so-called weakness are healthy and robust men
in every other respect, men who, possibly, have been treated by tonics,
electricity, etc., for a weakness which. If the above has been made clear, will
be understood never to have existed. Some years ago we called the attention
of the medical profession and others to the fact that the above well defined
symptoms were not weaknesses, but results of inflammation, and that drugs
could not cure, but procedures directed toward repairing the damage, always
proved successful, was known as the "Talcott Theory." A recent number of
the Medicnl News pays us a pretty compliment In saying, "it is no longer a
theory, but a fact." and the profession have now, adopted the Talcott Pros-
tatic Dilator and Urethral Suppository Depositor as a necessity in the treat-
ment of these troubles.

The monuments of the Mason and Dlxon
Boundary line between Pennsylvania and

replaced with cast-iron markers.
Rapid progress is now being made on

portion, was originally marked by stone
monuments at equal distances of one mile
Many of these stones have been removed
or destroyed. The western portion. owin S
to the peat difficulty at that time in tht
region traversed by the line, wa3 marked
by wooden posts, cut on the spot, and
secured in place by mounds of earth; or
stone piled around them. These posts
have disappeared, but some of the mounds
remain. Many of them have been 'de
stroyed by cultivation of the ground.' It
is believed, though, that enough of them
can be recovered to enable the relocation
of the boundary with precision. â¢;

The Pennsylvania Railroad's course in
deciding to enter New York City by tun
nel, building a station or terminus at Her
ald Square, cannot be" welcome to the
other trunk lines. It will certainly equip
the road for carrying many more passen
gers from New York, westward and from
the city,- and the superiority
of its service facilities will aid it in ob
taining business. . Moreover, when it has
constructed its loop around Brooklyn to
Hell Gate and .the bridge' contemplated
there Â¦ connecting with .the New. York, 1
New Haven and Hartford," it will Invite
passengers as well as freight from lower
New England to its main line into the
"West. It may require some imagination
to make the workability of all its New
.York plans perfectly comprehensible, but
the wealth and the excellent management
of the road point to a time when the im
provements and extensions it Is engaging
â¢upon will become obviously necessary, and
profitable features in the development of
'its Eastern business. By and by, per
;haps, it will be equally plain that the

I have been quoted as saying that "those
fellows," meaning those who were out â¢ on
strike, "were begging- of us." That Is cer
tainly a mistake. What I, did say was that
national and international organizations were
good, for two reasons, and save for those they
were no good .at all: First. If they could keep
their men away from the seat of trouble and
second, put up funds to support those.. in' trou
ble. This I found to work quite the other way
with ourselves, and It would be the same with
those boys; they would, like ourselves, have to
depend on local resources In order to carry on

â¢ Those sand teamsters had a contract to carry
on work for many months to come. Mr. Rosen
berg has seen fit to break that contract. This
the Buildings Trades Council strenuously ob
jects to, and, to offset any future troubles of
that kind, will have under .control of the
Building Trades Council all men actually en
gaged 4n the building business. This. may not
be brought about in a. day, but.lt Is Just as
sure to. come as that- the sun rises and sets
The Building Trades Council does not Indulge
ln bluffs, and Is not going to allow the thou
sands of men . affiliated with it, both as work
men, contractors and material men, to suffer
for something the arrangements of which they
have had nothing to do with. â¢ Â¦ -'Â¦ Â¦
From the foregoing ,any one with an eye to
business can Bee why the sand teamsters have
been called out; and -for that reason. If for no
other. It. Is Incumbent upon those men, as also
those engaged in the building- business, to see
thaf the building industry must not, by any
act of. Mr. Rosenberg, be disturbed: "
Saw Fit to Break Contract.
The contractors, sub-contractors and work
men engaged ln the different departments of
the building indsutry have, if any, very Jlttle
connection with the parties who are contest
ing the ground with the Water Front Federa
tion, and If Mr. Rosenberg and hia colleagues
were desirous of striking a blow at the afore
said he would have called out organizations
â¢which, it could at least be claimed, were close
to the line of battle now waging. .He calls out
the, sand teamsters, who were miles away from
the seat of trouble, but allows to continue
operations the hackmen who drive the employers
of labor all over the city; the horseshoers. who
shoe the horses formerly driven by the union
teamsters; the milk drivers, the delivery wagon
drivers and, last but not least, the union to
which the president 'of the. Labor Council be
longs. Â¦; â¢â¢
The facts are Mr. Rosenberg has nothing In
the world to do with the building Industry,
and, as. such, Is stepping Into territory over
which he has no control. The Building Trades
Council has had nothing to do with the ar
rangements of this controversy, from the be
ginning to the present timeâ the sole manage
ment of the entire affair being vested ln the
hands of those affiliated with the Labor Coun
cil. Now Mr. Rosenberg would like to Involve
the building trades ln the controversy and to
that end he orders out on strike the Sand
Teamsters'. Union. He. does this for the sole
purpose of tying up the building industry and
inflicting hardships on the several contractors
and material men engaged in the building busi
ness, as also -the men affiliated with the Build
ing Trades Council, thus showing that he has
allowed prejudice and passion to take the place
of common sense and good judgment. .This can
very readily be seen from the following state
ment of facts: â¢ *; Â¦ â¢
Out of His Territory.
The Building Trades Council has done more
In the past, 1 la doing now and will ln the fu
ture for ' honest, legitimate labor unions than
anything Mr. Rosenberg or his colleagues, re
gardless of whom they may be. has ever done:
and when he says the Building Trades Council
is working against -.honest, legitimate and
straightforward union principles, carried on on
a basis of equity, he says the thing that Is
not true, and he says It because he knows It
to be such.
Mr. Rosenberg has for some time endeavored
to subordinate the Building Trades Council to
any old thing that he may organize, but with
no success. â¢ Â¦ .. .
This declaration is only in -line with every
act of the above-mentioned business agent (Mr.
Rosenberg). . His stock ln trade ln alT matters
Is made up largely of bluff, such as it was
when he published to the world that -an In
ternational union of painters, paper hangers
and decorators had Joined the Labor Council
for the purpose of showing that the building
trades â¢ were in . the Labor Council lni large
numbers, when in reality- there.- were only
eighteen (18) members ln the union which he
took .In. and. their charter questioned by the
local ,and national bodies of painters at that
time, also many trades ln . building business,
wherein he made a grand bluff and deceived
the public. The Building Trades Council will
set them right on all matters connected with
the building business.
In Line With His Every Act
Again he says: "Mr.' McCarthy's movement
1b insignificant and so simple that It does not
perturb us: this strike - will . go right on and
be won despite anything he may be able to do."
From the latter we Â¦ may Judge that - Mr.
Rosenberg is impressed with the ldÂ«a that he
Is the true and hard-worked friend of labor

Interview from Business Agent Rosenberg of

other things: "This work on the part of. the
Building Trades Council cannot have much ef
fect upon conditions, and Is simply in line
with other things that' body haa done; even
If the Building Trades â¢Council does organize

STRIKING TEAMSTERS ASSAULT
THREE MEN ON CROWDED STREET
NOT since the beginning of the strike by the unions affiliated â¢ with the
City Front Federation has there been a day with so little evidence. of
the effectiveness of the measures adopted by the labor leader:! as yes
terday. Along the water front particularly more" work was done than
on any previous day, and more vessels got to sea. â¢
Shipping men look upon these facts as the more significant because of the
comparative ease with which their operations were carried on. "Where ' at first
cargoes were loaded and unloaded arid ships moved only as the, result of most un
usual exertions and at great expense, permanent forces of non-union laborers
have now been secured and work Is carried on with much of the facility of
times of industrial peace and ships are being sent to sea with full cargoes and
on time. Yesterday five vessels sailed and seven are ready; to sail to-day. Col
liers are being unloaded, grain shins are being sent to sea with cargoes from
Port Costa, and steamers . for. the Orient and for the coast ports are moving on
schedule time and carrying their usual cargoes. The lumber, schooners are prac
tically the only vessels in port that are not supplied with the labor needed, and
the lumbermen say that by next week they expect to have gangs of men !at
â¢work unloading the cargoes of the vessels now at dock. .;
In the wholesale district there Is evidence of an increasing volume â¢ of busi
ness, though the transportation problem is greater r there. -Merchants report
that lack of police protection for teamsters Is the only 'thing " that holds busi
ness back from reaching something like its normal volume. -
At the meeting of * representatives of the various cbmmerclar bodies yesterday
morning, -business men present reported an increase in the number of former
employes who were coining to them with expressions of dissatisfaction with the
situation and of their 'desire to return to work, did not fear of violence prevent
them. The number of non-union men at work is increasing day by day, and it
was pointed out at the meeting the number of those who are proving worthy
permanent employment Is. constantly growing and the number of places left for
old employes Is decreasing in a like proportion. â¢
Less of violence was offered yesterday, partly on account of the rain; ln the
evening, which drove bothi non-union men and strikers indoors. Doubtless also
the appeals of the . leaders , and the warnings given by -the Longshoremen's
Union, Captain Lyman of the! transport service, and others, had their effect" ill
restraining those with riotous tendencies. . :
Â¦ HE representatives of various
I commercial bodies of San Fran-
I Cisco. Including the Chamber, of
1L Commerce, Produce Exchange,
Board of Trade. State Board of
Trade. Merchants' Association and Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association,
who are engaged in considering means of
restoring peace to San Francisco, met at
x .the Chamber of Commerce yesterday at
Â¦ 31 a. m., with President Sbarboro in the
chair. The committee appointed to con
fer with Mayor Phelan with reference to
issuing a proclamation demanding that
peace be restored reported that the Mayor
refused to issue a proclamation until he
Â¦was fully convinced, after further study
"of the situation, that such a measure was
m. necessity, in view of this decision, the
committee was powerless to take further
action in the premises.
The report of the committee disclosed
the nature of the conference with the
-Jlayor.- which had been rigidly withheld
Irom the press. The announcement had
k been made by the Mayor that no confer
, ence was held with the representatives of
any business bodies, and this statement
"Â«' a s corroborated by all the employes in
the Mayor's office. The committee re
ported in detail all that transpired. It
was during the committee's visit that
, Captain Lyman came with his demand for
. protection for the laborers working on the
transport dock. Unless the city was pre
pared to furnish such assistance, said
Captain *-yman. a troop of cavalry would
â¢be ordered to the dock from the Presidio.
The Mayor directed Police Commissioner
to confer with the of Po
lice and see if adequate force could be
Â¦spared to protect the transport dock and
the, laborers. It was found that only
three policemen could be spared for that
service. /
It was the sentiment of the meeting
*5r at 6ucn â¢ protection was inadequate.
Complaint was made that any police pro
tection given to the transport dock meant
: the withdrawal to that extent of protec
tion from private citizens and non-union
. laborers, and it was felt to be unjust that
/the United States, which has ample mili
.tary force to protect its dock and its la
borers, should be protected to any extent
by the city, while citizens who have not
the capacity of the nation to protect
; themselves and laborers in the pursuit of
a lawful occupation should be left with
out adequate protection.
- After the committee had reported and
the report had been accepted, a resolution
'Â¦was passed continuing the committee ln
.action and Instructing It to confer at once
atctth the Chief of Police to find out wheth
er he is able with the force at his disposal
â¢under the charter to suppress the con
..Etantly increasing 1 riots and murderous
"assaults that are taking place In the city.
. Considerable stress was laid upon the
-fact that the maritime laws of the United
States are being violated by the rioters
invading- ships ln the harbor and forcing
â¢ their crews ashore at the point of the
pistol. This being a serious felony under
j the Federal law, it was decided to Invoke
.; Federal authority for the Immediate ar-
I rest and punishment of these offenders If.
their identity can be detected.
The reports made by the various busi
ness men to the meeting Indicated an in
. crease in riot, violence and disorder
throughout the disturbed districts of the
.city and at the eame time an equal In
crease in the number of strikers who go
yto their employers expressing their desire
to return to work and giving as a reason
for not breaking the strike in that man
ner their fear that they cannot be pro
iected against murderous assaults.

I T'FFORTS at conciliation of employers and strikers' have practically- been abandoned, though the committee of the Board of

however, on either side of the controversy who now anticipate any compromise. The labor leaders are concentrating their efforts
on arrangements for the great demonstration of Labor day (to-morrow), and employers are bending their . energies to send business
along at. the customary gait in spite of obstacles, and with such success that yesterday sazv the greatest volume of business transacted
of any day since the beginning of the general strike and also less violence than any recent day. , I ..' ' >

Â¦ In pursuance of his plan to close the
bars on the local ferry tx.ats. General
Manager Kruttschnitt of ihe Southern
Pacific 1 Company, who is now in the vicin
ity of El Paso, sent a telegram to the
local office commanding that the bars
dose on the last day of August. The
telegram was received on Friday, and
yesterday morning another dispatch came
conntertnanding the previous message and
extending the time of closing for another
thirty days. -â ~. . .
The liquor men are much incensed at
this manner of doing business. They say
that, in the first place, the bars on the
boats bring no scandal, arc doing no
harm, and, inasmuch as they are a gen
eral convenience to the traveling public,
they should be allowed to remain! They
say that the saloons are In the hold of
ihe boat, away from public view and that
only those who desire to patronize them
ever see them. If they have to go, they,
the liquor men, would like to know some
lhing definite en the matter, as this state
of uncertainty upsets their business and
makes everything go by sixes and sevens.
Among railroad men the general Im
pretslon is that Kruttschnitt .wishes .the
bars to go, but the protest made to
Hays by the liquor men has had the effect
of postponing the consummation of the

In the course of time Neill allied him
self with a manager named Giffen, and
the Glften-Neill Company played in Den
ver, Colo. This was in 1S94. The company
did .not meet with the greatest 1 success
and the management was in sore financial
straits. : It was then that Timothy Daniel
Frawley came to the rescue. His loan of
$800 proved .the . salvation of the enter
prise, i Fortune smiled on Neill and the
company began to; play to. big Â¦ houses.
Neil! then sent "another company , to the
Northwest. In this company was Fraw
ley, and after ' a . successful engagement
Timothy," who was a i thrifty member of
tlie> profession, had 'Â¦ money In the bank.
Frawley telegraphed - Neill and * asked :Â¦ if
he was willing . to sell his shares in :the
company, and as Neill was willing Fraw
ley. soon became a, full-fledged -manager.
The Frawley, Company made its debut at
the- Columbia and >local play
goers 'can recall how popular Â¦ it became. 1 "

Â¦\. The: Neill Company L has also prospered,
and. as both managers are now playing in
this city it. was decided â¢ to commemorate
the anniversary of thelr-Joint debut in the
theatrical world with - a banquet, which
was a, grand success. Â¦ 'â¢}';'Â¦Â¦
Nineteen years ago Neill and Frawley
answered an advertisement' In a' dramatic
paper and both were accepted. '< They were
sons of Confederate olticers, and coming
as they did from the South and being in
the same company they naturally were
thrown much together and struck up a
friendship that bids fair to continue to
the end of their lives. Frawley had been
an amateur actor and belonged to an as
sociation in Washington. Neill, who is a
native of Savannah, Ga., was a- member
of the John T. ' Ford Amateur .Dramatic
Association. They began ;. their profes
sional stage. careers as members of a com
pany that was producing a* highly suc
cessful play called "Only, a- Farmer's
Daughter." Helen Blythe, who is, remem
bered by- old timers, was the star.-. Their
experience In the profession was not un
like those -of many 'others. .They under
went, hardships, had their successes and
failures and like true friends shared their
purses and pleasures. ' . -' Â¦ Â¦ .
Neill and Frawley started out as actors
together, and the subsequent career of
each is full of interesting â¢ Incidents.
Among other, things is the; fuc.t'not'een
erally known that the success' of both
managers was due to the sum, of jsOu,
which was advanced by Frawley to his
lriend Neill. ' ' :
It was a. happy gathering of footllght
favorites that sat down to. the sumptuous
repast. Speeches were delivered by Mr.
Frawley and Mr. Neill. They recounted
to their friends how they, had started out
on the road to win fame and to what ex
tent they had achieved it. Graceful little
speeches were made also by - Miss Marie
Van Buren. Miss Julia "Dean,- 'Frank Mc-
Vicker and others. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦Â¦ ; +i
James Neill and T. Daniel Frawley,

Ringling Bros.', circus was crowded last
night. The people v poured in until it
seemed as if they "would neve'r stop, and
the management was finally obliged to
order the sale of tickets stopped, all the
seats having been taken. - - ; ' .-
Not a reserved seat v^as to be had after;
7:45. It' was a jolly crowd, a glad-they
.were-tnere and . don't-fret. gathering, and
it seemed to enjoy, every minute. The;aft
â¢ornoon show was*- almost as largely at
tended as that of the evening.
'â¢'There' Is a good reason for all this
prosperity," says James Jay Brady, the
famous circus expert. "The mammoth
shows of the Ringiing Bros, are conspicu
ous for finish, which makes an evening
spent at them a delight in every way.
'ihe animals are healthy, well kept and
well selected," the tents are clean and
commodious, the attaches civil and a
grand programme is offered."
And then Brady, the expert, tells of
things as they seem to the man on the
insiae: "The management of the arena,
which falls to the lot of Al Ringling. is a
wonderful piece of work. Standing near |
the centerof the tent, with eye alert and i
active mind, not a thing going on under
the big tent escapes his notice. The per
formers obey the sound of the. whistle
implicitly, and | the pUeasing manner in
which each . exhibition . blends into its
successor leaves nothing to be desired in;
the way of continuous entertainment. Not
only do the performers obey Mr. Ring
ling, but every one of the ropemen and
ringcIeareTS moves like clockwork.' The
nets' are whipped off in a twinkling, tra
pezes and slack wires disappear and the
big platforms used by John O'Brien in
his wonderful sixty-one-horse act are re
moved in less time than it takes to
tell it. - . -. Â¦â¢â¢.â¢- .
"The circus must prove a never-ending
delight to the children, for. Ringling Bros,
seem â¢ to have made a special effort to
give them pleasure. There are- forty
clowns, each one funny. , r .
"One of the' most remarkable features
of the show is the slack wire work of the
Holloway trio, two men and a woman,
who perform a series of feats upon a
slender wire which for novelty' and. dar
ing stands unexcelled. Miss -^Amelia
Feely.a graceful bareback rider, is an
other feature of the show. She is but. 17
years old, yet her performance t is not
equaled by any other artist in her line."
The last performance will be given to
night, after' which the : show will break
camp and exhibit- in San Jose Monday.
No other circus has ever given satisfac
tion ' here equal to that of the Ringling
Bros., and it will be the wish of every
one that it may be an; annual visitor, to
the coast. Two performances, the last,
will be given to-day at 2. and 8. o'clock. Â¦ Â«â¢

Harriman admitted that when he saw
the boy on the elevator he did not order
him to get off. The jury Â«_ however, ren
dered'a verdict of ' accidental death and
did not attach any blame to the company.
The elevator, In charge of Harriman,
stopped at the fourth floor with a packing
case containing Â¦ a perforator. While the
case was being .unloaded young Mellln
left his work and got on the elevator. An
unfortunate movement of tho apparatus,
lowering the elevator about three feet
and tipping the case against the boy,
caused him to fall through a space be

of the directors, Mr. Kearney says:
Although Terrell has been denounced as
a fraud by the NeTi/Tork World, he has
had a prosperous time.
In" Terrell's possession was found a list
of \ 200 persons in San Francisco from
whom -he had obtained sums of money.
Among these were Alex Greggains the
fighter, and F. S. Skaggs of the St. Nich

At the County ; Jail to-day Terrell said
his home -was in Utica, New Tork, and
that he was 28 years of age. He has fol

on the streets and passing the hat. On
June 6, 1900, he left the New York World
office for a tour of the United States, but
he says he was not authorized by the
World. He came direct to San Francisco.
This was nine rnonths ago and since then
he has made a trip to New Orleans and
back, and also . to Portland, Oregon.

The discovery was made by a Mexican
shepherd some time ago, but he kept it
secret. A few days ago he was discharged
and went to Dos Cabezas, where he be
came Intoxicated. His money gave out
and a saloon keeper refused to give him
more whisky. The Mexican flashed a bot
tle which was filled with nuggets of gold
and at once efforts were begun .to learn
whence the gold came. The Mexican did
not have to pay for any more whisky
during his stay In camp. He refused to
reveal the location of the gold fields, but
a friend who arrived in camp persuaded
the discoverer to take him out to the dig
gings.

BELVEDERE, Aug. 31.â The feud which
has so long" existed between the cliff
dwellers and the Kelpie men of this place
was held In abeyance last night, when
chosen representatives of i both parties
met and contested for honors on the
friendly field of vaudeville. The big room
in the hotel was cleared for the event. A
stage had been erected at one end, while
the balance of the spacewas given over to
seats, which, though accommodating
nearly 200. were altogether too few for the'
number that had congregated to watch
their champions attempt to be as funny
as they are reputed to be. In order to
provide sustenance as well as entertain
ment an admission of 25 cents was
charged. IL.iough of a fund was acquired
to provide af sumptuous supper.
The performance was advertised to
commence at S o'clock. After a delay
which was almost professional In Its
duration,- the flag was dropped and off
they started, with the Corinthian quar
tet In the lead. The quartet was com
posed of Frank Thompson. Edgar F.
Sagar, Walter Howe and "Eddie" Angela.
Then came Joe Rosborough of the High
land Park Coliseum, who sang 'a serious
song in a serious baritone voice. 'Mr.
Rosborough made such a hit that he was
encored several times.
Mrs. Van Horn rendered a recitation*
and applauding listeners compelled her to
repeat it. She was followed by Mrs. F. C.
Youngberg, who has a beautiful voice and
knows how to use it so well that she need
not fear to enter the Iist3 with the best
of professional talent.
Alex Rosborough. the other one of the
brothers, did a number of clever special
ties. Mr. Rosborough explained his ver
satility by saying that he was twins and
consequently It came easy to him to do
several things at once.
Dr. Green did his famous hobo act and
did it so well that the stuffed property
dog was seen to exhibit marked signs of
uneisiness.
The monologue part of the entertain
ment was assigned to "Binky" McKinnon.
"Binky" gave a very clever talk, parody-
Ing life on the arks and pointing out "in
his inimitable manner the fancies and
foibles of the curious persons who are to
be found stranded along the stretches of
these, shores.
| -When Mr. McKinnon had been driven
oft the stage, Oscar Franks reoderetjva
tenor solo, which he was' compelled to
repeat again, and again before his-audi
ence would let him go.
The affair ended with a few selections
by the "Bum Quartet," composed of
"Dud" Dean. "Binky" McKinnon. Alex
.Rosborough and Dr. Green. "Dud" and
his three accessories managed to escape
without any serious casualties.
From start- to- finish the show went
along with remarkable smoothness. There
was but one intermission and tha f . was
charmingly filled In by a violin solo by
Miss Grace Saunderson. | Maurice Kramer
and Miss Elsie Maxwell acted as accom
panists, and not a little of the pleasure
of the evening is to be attributed to the
excellence of their work. The affair was
a success and as every one had something
to' do with it. every one is happy. $

BATTALION" DRILL
BY THE ARTILLERY
The Naval Militia Is All Ready for
the Cruise. on the Phil
adelphia.
The First Battalion of Artillery of the
National Guard had a very creditable drill
on Van Ness avenue last Monday night.
Although no notice for such drill had been
sent out it being the regular drill night
for the four batteries, nearly two hundred
men paraded. Among the movements ex
ecuted were right and left of companies,
rear into column, break from the right to
march to the left In columns of fours and
companies, close column, deployments,
changes of front, changes of direction and
marching In line of companies in columns
of fours. It was noticed that the guides
were ! more prompt In the discharge of
their several duties than they were on
the occasion of the previous street drill,
showing that they had 5 profited by In
structions received since then. The drill
was witnessed by a largo number of cit
izens, who appeared .to be greatly in
terested. Quartermaster Sergeant Gal
braith of Battery B acted as sergeant
major and demonstrated that he is as
good in drill as he is in handling uniforms.
The prizes were distributed as follows:
Championship of the coast in doubles:
Misses May and Violet Sutton: runners
up. Misses Miriam Hall and Alice Hoff
man. Mixed doubles championship,
George "Whitney and Miss Hall: runners
up, U. B. Collier and Miss May Sutton.
Women's singles championship and tour
nament. Miss May Sutton: runner up.
Miss Ethel Sutton. Consolation for one
first beaten by -winner of singles tourna
ment. Miss Violet Sutton. All of the prizes
but three were loving cups. The singles
challenge cup was won for the first time
last year and Miss Button's name Is the
second to be inscribed. It is to be won
three times for absolute property. At
present It looks as if the cup would re
main south for many years, as all four
sisters outclass any other women on the
coast. . â¢
Miss Hall certainly tried hard to stave
off defeat and played the game of her life,
but the little southern champion was not
to be denied: Miss Hall is a very small
and frail girl and throughout the match
was greatly handicaped by a lack of
strength. Most of her balls fell short in
the court and . Miss Sutton was able to
do as she pleased with them. On the other
hand, Miss Sutton Is short but of power
ful build, and her driving and smashing;
are very speedy. Miss Hall was a trifle
nervous during: the three sets, but Miss
Sutton, confident that she could not lose
and knowing 1 her own ability, was per
fectly cool. One could not help but ad
mire the pluck of Miss Hall.
In the last set Miss Hall started out well,
taking the first game, but her opponent
steadied down and soon ran the score up
to 3â1 in her favor. Miss Hall won the
next game, and It began to look as if the
last set would be very close, but the next
three games and match, went to Miss
Sutton.
In the second set both ladies played
from the back court throughout, and con
sequently the rallies were much longer
than In the first set. Miss Hall did very
much better in this set and obtained many
more points. Miss Button's driving was
phenomenal for Its accuracy and brought
forth great applause from the spectators.
Her headwork was very much better
yesterday than at any time during the
week. Miss Sutton took this set. 6â2.
Although the score looks rather one
sided, the last two sets were closely con
tested. In the first set Miss Hall tried to
â¢play at the net but was passed repeatedly.
She was able to obtain only eight points
In the entire set, and five of them in the
last game. This will give a good idea of
the wonderful game put up by the winner.
Before the larirest crowd that has as
sembled on the courts of the Hotel Rafael
In many years Miss May Button, the 15
year-old wonder from Southern Califor
nia, wrested the championship of the
coast from Miss Miriam Hall, the former
Incumbent. One and all voted It the
greatest tennis ever played by women in
this part of the country, and the game put
up by the new champion was probably
equal to the champion women players of
the United States. There, has been a
doubt lurking In the minds of some dur
ingr the week as to Miss Sutton's ability
to beat Miss Marlon Jones, but that doubt
was dispelled yesterday In the champion
ship match. The score in favor of Miss
Button waa Sâ 0, 6â2. 6â2.

It was in the fourth inning that the

Eagan. who went to the first sack on
Reilly's error and second on Drennan's
out, ecored on one of thosÂ« poor, â¢ weak,
lucky pop hits that go nowhere in par

Although devoid of much hitting:, the
third eame of this series was as pretty
to look at as any rabid crank could de

bunch of errors, the fielding was sharp

Out of thirteen chances Shay errored but
once, and this was on account of slipping

Sir Thomas Lipton Well

Sixth Trial Spin' Proves to
Be Successful and
Satisfactory.
NEW YORK. Augr. ZLâ The sixth trial
spin of the Shamrock II to-day, thanks to
a stiff breeze from the southeast, de
veloped into a speed trial over a measured
course, the results of which are consid
ered satisfactory by Sir Thomas Lipton
and his friends.
Sir Thomas said yesterday that when
Mr. Jameson arrived he would be In abso

board the Shamrock to-day and In charge
every minute of her trial. Judging from
the masterly way In which she was

of the course at the rate of fourteen
knots an hour. Sir Thomas Lipton.
gauging her speed by that of the Erin,
claims half a knot more.
Passing the spit buoy soon after 11
o'clock, all hands clapped on the main
sheet and trimmed it down Â¦ almost flat
for the close reach up the main ship
channel. As soon as she hauled up on the
wind the yacht jumped away at a twelve
knot rate and against- a three knot tide.
All the way up the channel she was
saluted by outbound steamers. '
Up through the Narrows and past Quar
antine the Shamrock sailed until 12:30.
Captain Sycamore then luffed her and
swung her around to the port tack for the
return trip. This first tack of the wind
ward work brought the yacht almost over
to Stapleton. Two more short tacks put
her through the Narrows. Afterward he
brought her out to Coney Island Point.
The picture the Shamrock presented aa

full force of the breeze "was a magnificent
one. "With her lee rail buried In a smother
of foam and her deck wet half way up
to tho mast with flying spray, the yacht
gave rn f-xhibition of sailing that aston
ished those who were watching her.
Captain Sycamore then waited for slack
water, to get a better gauge on her speed.
When the channel was all clear of steam
ers he put her on the starboard tack, and,
easing sheets, went for the first mark,
the Southwest f?pit buoy. Gathering way
as she felt the strength of the breeze, the
green beauty sped away to the northwfwd
on her second trip, at steamboat speed.k
George L. Watson. William Jameson
and . Commodore Hilliard sat on deck
watching every detail of the spars, sails
and hull.
At 3 o'clock the yacht headed back to
Sandy Hook on the port tack, nearly
closehauled and with a fresher breeze
than she had before. Faster than ever
she traveled under its Influence, putting
her lee rail dowp to the water and often
taking little srreen seas over her lee bow,
until her deck was wet clear up to her.

coming up astern of her. was traveling
fifteen knots, and it took her nearly
fifteen minutes to overhaul and pass her
from a point about an eighth of a mile
astern. From this It was estimated that
the green yacht was traveling quite four
teen kots an hour for the five miles be
tween Coney Island Point and the South
west Spit buoy.
Sir Thomas Llpton. who remained on
board the Erin all day, seemed particu
larly pleased with his yacht's perform

JUDGMENT IS SHE ASIDE
HI FAMOTJS DIVORCE CASE
Mrs. Charles H. Smith, Who Was Her
Own Counsel, Secures a Par
tial Victory.
Mrs. Charles H. Smith may have an
other opportunity of displaying her ability
as a lawyer in her own divorce case. Last
Friday Judge Murasky set aside the
judgment secured by her husband and thÂ«
sensational developments of the last trial
may again be brought to public notice If
the case again comes to trial.
In 1893 the Court granted Mrs. Smith
permanent alimony in a suit brought by
her husband, with an allowance for her
son Carlysle until he was of age. Last
year Mr. Smith, wiio is connected with
the Southern Pacific Company, brought
suit for a divorce on the -ground of cru
elty. Samuel M. Shortridge was Mr*.
Smith's attorney, but having had a &0
ference with his client he retired from
the case. As Mrs. Smith was unable to
secure other counsel sht> decided to act
as her own attorney.
Mrs. Smith's cross-examination of h^r
husband was so sensational that the at
tention of the entire community was fo
cused on the case. Mrs. Smith was taken
ill dnring the trial and according to her
statement -she stipulated with her hus
band's attorney to put the case over un
til after Christmas. She alleges that in
stead of carrying out his agreement At
torney "Walker took snap judgment
against her.

. TO TRY FOR STTPREMACY
BASEBALL GAMES ON
THE EASTERN DIAMONDS
The rank and file could see nothing In
the race but the Whitney entries," Nastur
tium and King Hanover, and opening at
9 to 5 they were quickly played down to
7 to 5 and 13 to 10. The Madden horses,
Yankee and Gun Fire, were ' a strong
second choice at 4 to 1, but the feeling
was not so strong for. this combination
when Blue Girl was scratched. Heno and
De Re?zke had a strong following at 10
to 1, while Barron, the much touted
maiden and Lux Casta, were also well
playe-1 at 12 and 15 to 1. respectively. The
others ranged in price from 20 to 25 to 1,
scattering bets being made on all of
them.
In the paddock the scene was a pretty
one. The candidates were being saddled
and fitted for the struggle, and a big
crowd watched, the final- touches. They
were a noble looking lot of thoroughbreds
The day was perfect for an outing and
thousands of lovers of the thoroughbred
were on hand to lend their voices to hail
the winner of the great race. Society was
put in force and the big grand stand was
packed to overflowing, while the broad
lawns and infield were black with people.
All the celebrities of the sporting world
were on hand and every walk of life
seemed to be represented. The, track was
fast and all the conditions j favorable for
a. true run race. Three races were
cided before the Futurity, but the interest
was plainly in the classic fixture, and the
crowd waited impatiently to see the start
of the 2-year-old parade past the stand on
the way to the post. The betting ring
was a seething mass of humanity. V The
layers of odds were besieged and a flood
of money poured in. It was almost im
possible to fight one's way near enough to
the layers to get a bet down.
NEW YORK, Aug." 31.â John E.
Madden's Yankee, at 4 to 1 in
the betting, won the classic
Futurity at Sheepshead Bay to
day, the richest fixture on the
American turf. He won driving by a
length and a half from what was perhaps
the best and nlghest class field . which
ever "ran for the stake. Lux Casta was
cecond, while Barron finished^ third. It
was' a great race,' and nobly won, and a
record breaking crowd of 30,000 . people
stood up In their excitement and wildly
cheered the victor.
RACING YACHT IS IU"
HANDS OF THE SHERIIT
Into the last furlong they came for the
heart-breaking dash to the wire. King
Hanover was gradually dropping back and
Odom sent Lux Casta to the front, close
ly followed by Pentecoet, Yankee, De
Reszke and Barron.- "The favorite la
beaten!" walled the crowd. "Lux Casta
wins!" shrieked those who were over
anxious to announce the result. But the
race was not over yet. O'Connor used
his whip on Yankee and the colt, respond
ing in the gamest manner, quickened his
stride and foot by foot crept up on the
flying leader. Odom was hard at work
with whip and spur on Lux Casta In an
Only at the post the crowd settled down
to wait for the flag. Eyes were strained
to watch the maneuvering for a start,
but except for those with strong glasses
it was a confused mass, the colors not
even being distinguishable. There were
two false breaks and the big crowd was
setting impatient for the word, when sud
denly -the familiar cry. of /'They're off!"
rang through the stand. It seemed to
electrify the crowd., At first it was a wild
scramble for position. Saturday was the
first to show, with King Hanover, Hyph
en, Yankee and De Reszke close at his
heels. It was a good start for all except
Heno, who wheeled as the flag fell and
was practically left. At top speed they
came to the bend Into the main track
like a line of cavalry and at that point
all eyes could see the blue with the brown
cap of Mr. Whitney's King Hanover on
the rail and a short neck before Pentecost.
Lux Casta, Yankee, De Reszke, Caugh
nawaga and Barron were well up and the
most prominent' of the others as they
flashed past the half mark. To every
one's surprise, however, Nasturtium, the
pride of the Whitney stable, was way
back in the ruck.
â¢ First came King Hanover and Nastur
tium, in the blue and brown cap of Wil
liam C. Whitney. Next followed Yankee,
in the cherry and white hoops of John E.
Madden, and the racy looking son of Han

$20,000 as a yearling, brought out words of
praise from many lips. Almost every

careful hands could make them. Gold

effort to earn the coveted honors, but
Yankee, with long, even strides, Was not
to be denied. A hundred yards from the
wire the two were head and head. Lux
Casta hung on gamely and for a few
strides neither could claim an advantage.
. It was a stirring struggle, a bitter fight,
and the monster crowd was cheering and
shouting. Then came the cry "Yankee
wins!" as foot by foot he drew away and
passed under the wire a length and a half
in front. Lux Casta was an easy second
and JBarron, closing with a rush, earned
third money by a head from De Reszke.
Then came Pentecost, King Hanover, Gun
Fire and the others. Nasturtium was
tenth and far back. The time was 1:09 1-5.
Â¦ Then came the usual scene. The band
played "Yankee Doodle,"' the crowd hail
ed the winner and his Jockey, O'Connor,
took his place in the floral horseshoe,
The Futurity of 1901 was a matter of his
tory and long will live the name of its
gallant winner.
The stake was worth $36,910 to the win
ner. The second horse earned $4166 66, and
the third horse $2083 35. Two thousand
dollars went to the breeder of the winner,
$1250 to the breeder of the second horse
and $500 to the breeder of the third horse.
The total stake was $46,910. A. Feather
stone, whose jockey rode the winner, got
25 per cent of the winner's share for al
lowing O'Connor to ride. William C.
Whitney also had some balm in the fact
that he owns a half interest In Tankee,
although It was a keen disappointment
not to see his colors in front. Those at
the start say Nasturtium was off well,
but Jumped- at a dark spot In the track,

Â¦ ' Â¦ Â¦ j Â¦ JGOVERNOR SCHROEDER'S LATE
SECRETARY, WHO CRITICIZES
THE DICTATOR OF GUAM.
POPULAR YOUNG' COUPLE^
WHO WERE MARRIED IN
OAKLAND YESTERDAY. -
"It would be difficult to imagine that
you were in a part of the United States if
you were to fall under the maladminis
tration of Governor Schroeder."
"An indication of his arbitrary acts is
the way in which the Government ice
plant is managed. An excellent plant has
been installed upon the-island and thou
sands of pounds of ice are turned out
daily. Thl3 ice is not all used and a
great deal is thrown away, and yet a civ
ilian employe of the Government cannot
secure a pound of that Ice.
"Governor Schroeder is no better in his
treatment of civilians. A clerk there lasts
about three weeks and then he resigns.
Though his appointment calls for return
transportation Governor Schroeder will
not issue it and some have had to escape
as stowaways. .
"An indication of hi3 treatment of the
men can-be gathered from the fact that
during the three months that I acted as
his secretary there were seventy sum
mary court-martials and twelve general
court-martials, and eighty-two out of the
150 marines on the island were up for dis
cipline. His sentences are very severe,
and the men are confined or overworked
in the tropical climate of the island with
inhuman disregard for their health.
"A soldier, in -Governor Schroeder's
opinion. Is something to be kicked, beaten
and abused. His treatment of the marine
guard of the island has been so bad that
at one time a large number of them
simply took to the hills and remained
there . until they were compelled to re
turn to the Government headauarters for
food. â¢ . .
"Governor Schroeder has no idea of
how to treat men under him. One would
think that they were in a barbarous
country rather than* under the flag of
free America, so autocjatlc Is the sway
of Governor Schroeder. He has regard
for neither soldier nor civilian. The
civilian empleyes of 'the Government are
glad to take the first transport from the
island, no matter in what direction she
goes, but the soldiers are not bo fortun
ate. Â«â¢*
said Smith to-night. "If I felt that I
could give out now all that came under
my observation during my short stay on
the island I think that the people of this
country would be somewhat surprised at
the way affairs are administered. .
OAKLAND, Aug. 31.â Rev. J. B. McXal

Oakland, will preach to-morrow evening
when special services of praise and
thanksgiving will be held. All of those
who participated, in the recent jubilee are
requested to be present at this service.

The law requires that when taxes or li
censes are paid they cannot be recovered
vnlcss they are paid under protest. Less
tlicn a dozen paid with a protest. There
is also a law that taxes and license
money cannot be refunded until a Super
ior Court has passed upon the ordinance.
As there is no likelihood that an appeal
will be taken from the decision of Police
Judge Smith this will bar even the re
covery of the money paid under protest.
Another license ordinance will be pre
pared that will include business as well as
a sign license.
OAKLAND, Aug. 31.â The city will keep
the money that was paid into the treas
ury by some 400 citizens who were willing
to ray under the sign license ordinance.
This amounts to $1277 and but very little
of this money can be recovered, even
should those who paid demand it.

In order to open the bridge, which Is
one of the largest draws in the United
States, it will be necessary to remove,
hundreds of telephone and telegraph
wires and cut the "tracks of the street
railway company. When these were
built across the bridge It was with the
Idea that they would remain for many
years, as the prospect of getting the
canal through- at that time was very
slim. Now the telephone and telegraph
companies will be compelled to stretch
cables to carry their wires across the
canal cut and the railroad company will
have to make some arrangement that
will avoid the constant breaking 1 of the
circuit by. the swinging of the bridge.-
The contractors expect trouble when
it comes to opening the bridge. It has
not been turned since it was built, twelve
years ago. The wheels beneath it oa
which it runs may be rusted so that
it cannot be started. The attention of
the Government officials has been called
to the condition of the bridge a number
of times, but nothing was done by them.
All the earth removed by the dredger
will be carried to an inclosure that has
been built near High street. A steam
paddy that has been employed by the
contracting company to remove the dry
earth will place its product in cars that
will also dump within this inclosure.
ALAMEDA. Aug. 31.-Work toward tho
cutting of the canal was begun to-day
by the contractors^ â the Atlantic, Pacific
and Gulf Dredging Company. An im
provement great importance to the
cities of Alameda. and Oakland that has
been held In abeyance for twenty years
now promises to go through without any
further delay and the people of this city
are pleased. They express great satis
faction over the activity of Senator Per
kins and Congressman Metcalf in : behalf
of the project. The3e two men. are being
given the credit of saving the contract
for the completion of the work from an
Indefinite "hold-up" by the Rivers and
Harbors Committee of Congress.
The big dredger of the contracting com
pany was moved up into the mouth of
the canal this afternoon. Its destination
is. the end of the canal, where it will dig
its fangs into the embankment and dis
charge the earth at a distance. The pro
gress of the dredger is stayed until ar
rangements can be made to open the
tidal canal bridge. This will take a day
or two at least.

REAL ESTATE TRANZACTION
OAKLAND. Aug. 3Lâ In a brief filed
to-day in behalf of former Police Officer
Kingsbury. who was dismissed from the
police force by the Board of Police and
Fire Commissioners, Attorney Aldrich
asserts that "by every recognized rule of
right and decency, outside of a high
binders' association, the board should
have permitted a full and complete
stenographic report of Its proceedings to
be taken, to the end that the court might
determine whaÂ£ class of high grade jug
gling with the constitutional amendments
and charter provisions took place within
that secret session, that secret investiga
tion, for it may well be said that for
aught this court knows there was not
sufficient testimony taken before that
board upon which to predicate its pre
tended verdict."
Aldrich seek* to have KJngsbury rein
stated to his former position through the
medium of the Superior Court. The case
Â¦will be heard by Judge Greene.

One of the prettiest of the many recent
weddings In tins city took place this aft
ernoon at 2:30 at the residence of Charles
Gi Reed, 1257 Filbert "street, when his
youngest daughter, Eva - May, Reed, be
came the bride of Harry Dale Danforth,
a young attorney of San Francisco.
Though the affair lacked ostentation, the
decorations were .very elaborate, the room
in which the ceremony was performed
being a veritable bower of pink blossoms.
Another room was beautified with glow
ing sunflowers, the emblem of fidelity.
One of. the pleasing features of the wed
ding was the reading of an original poem,
written for the occasion by the brides
aged grandfather. Captain William Reed.
The bride looked very winsome in a white
mulle. gown made over white silk. The
shower bouquet she carried was of white
Japanese lilies and tulle. The number of
guests was limited to forty/ only very
near relatives being, invited. There were
no bridesmaids, but the young couple
were attended by Mr. and Mrs. H. p.
Swales, the latter being a sister : of the
â¢ bride Dr. C. R. Brown of the First Con
gregational Church officiated. Mr. and
Mrs Danforth will be absent on their
wedding journey about two weeks and on
their return will reside at the Reed home
on Filbert street. Â£.. ;
One " of the most enjoyable functions of
the season was the "progressive. dinner
which was given last evening. by a num
ber of prominent society people of this
city and Berkeley. The hostesses and
euests were all members of a party which
spent the summer at Rowardennan. One
course was served at each, residence and
the guests were carried^in a large omnj:
bus from house to house. Great origmai
ity and taste were displayed in the decora
tions and souvenirs. At Mrs. T. C. Coo-

After a honeymoon trip the newly mar
ried couple will reside in a pretty home
on Twenty-third street, furnished as a
wedding gift by the bride's mother. The
bride is a graduate of the College of No
tre Dame in Marysville. where her pa
rents formerly resided. The groom is a
graduate of the Oakland High School and
is the present Deputy County Clerk.
AKLAND, Aug. 31.â The wedding
ft :\\ of Miss Mabel J. Shoo and Leslie
11 II R. . McKillican took place this
:\_^/ evening at the residence of the
> bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. J.
J. Shoo, 2249 Grove street. The event was
made doubly interesting by the" fact that
to-day is the silver wedding of Mr. and
Mrs., Shoo. The groom is a son of Col
onel Robert McKillican, ex-Sheriff of Ala
meda County, and the young people were
united by Judge W. E. Greene, an old
time friend of -the elder McKillican. The
residence was brilliantly illuminated with
Chinese lamps and the, decorations were
effectively- carried out in pink and green.
The Lohengrin bridal march was played
by an orchestra of stringed instruments.
The bride's gown was of white organdie
over white taffeta and she carried a show
er bouquet of orange blossoms and tulle.
The bridesmaid, Miss Victoria Shoo, way
gowned in Nile green organdie over taf
feta and carried bridesmaid \ roses and
maidenhair fern. Mrs. Shoo, the bride of
twenty-five years ago and mother of the
bride of to-day, wore a handsome gown
of black silk with steel trimming.
"As there will be a Congressional inves
tigation -of the conditions that exist at
Guam and of the acts of Governor
Schroeder, and as I will be a witness be
fore inquisitors, it will hardly be proper
to make public now what should first be
given to the Congressional committee,"
OAKLAND, Aug. 3L-William B.
Smith, who was appointed secre
tary to the Governor of the island
of Guam, has, returned to his
home in this city. Mr. Smith is
a brother of Police Judge Mortimer Smith
and a son of former Councilman J. H.
Smith, and has been prominent in Oak
land for many years. Last winter he was
appointed to the position of secretary to
Governor Schroeder and sailed from this
city at once to assume his new duties.
But Mr. Smith found that everything
was not peaches and cream on our far
away possession. From the very first
Governor Schroeder and the new secre
tary did not get along well together, and
Governor Schroeder very soon announced
that he would not longer accept Mr.
Smith as his secretary. Mr. Smith there
upon returned to Oakland, coming home
by wav of Manila and Japan.
Mr. Smith returns with some very hard
stories of the conditions that exist on the
little island far out In the Pacific Ocean-
He declares that there will be a Gongreb
sional investigation of Governor Schroe
der's acts, and he announces that he is
going to be a witness at this investiga
tion. He says he has enough informatiwi
to make all kinds of trouble for the Gov
ernor.

Mr. and Mrs. Apel came to Alameda to
live about twenty-two years ago. He had
lost a large portion of his fortune in spec
ulation. They lived quietly . together on
Buena Vista avenue, where he died in
January of 1S90. After her husband's
death Mrs. Apel seems to have lost caste
entirely. , She was frequently brought to
public notice through her escapades and
fights with creditors. , . - :
The couple entertained on a lavish scale
and were at the head of many, private
and public functions. They could spend
a fortune on asingle entertainment with
remarkable ease and their funds seemed
to^be Inexhaustible. Mrs. Apel attracted
considerable attention on ; account of her
beauty, and "was spoken of as the most
handsome .woman in San Francisco in the
pioneer days. Â¦ . .
. In the early fifties . Mrs. Apel was a
leader ki San- Francisco society. She had
married John Apel; an Â¦ Austrian â¢ noble
man, who had come to California after
having been banished- for . a political or
fense from his own country. He was a
shrewd manipulator of men and money
and succeeded in amassing a fortune as a"
street contractor, having become some

city. â¢ . Â¦ -. . .- . ; . . â¢
ALAMEDA, Aug. 31.â Mrs. Mary Anne
Apel, an aged character, who was \ noted
for her entertainments in the early days
of California, died to-day at her residence,
625 Central avenue. Once wealthy, Mrs.
Apel's death came in the midst of pov
erty; 'She long ago exhausted. her cieans
and a few' days ago all the 'furniture in
her house, with the exception of the bed
on which she lay, was taken' to . satisfy
the claims of. a creditor. She was unable
to buy the necessaries of life and was de
pendent on the charity of neighbors for
succor.
As Mrs. Apel was always reticent about
her own affairs, little that is authentic is
known of her people or birth. All that
is positively known is that her maiden
name' was Mary Anne Stanley Norman,
and that she was born somewhere in
England more than eighty years ago. She
was said to be a niece of Perrin, the orig
inal member of the tirm of Lea & Pen-in,
the famous manufacturers of table 'deli

ried three'times. Â¦ â¢ , .

per cent.
The Berkeley Trustees wanted more in
come for the town. The total assessment
roll of the city footed $360,000 more than
last year, but this, the Trustees felt, was
not enough and so they followed the ex
ample of the city of Oakland and pro
ceeded to raise valuations in certain parts
of the town. West Berkeley was not
touched, as it was felt that the increases
in values had been in the property sur
rounding the university. All of the prop
erty directly surrounding the university
grounds on the three sides and for vary
ing distances back had their valuations
increased on the percentage plan. The
plan of increasing each piece, 'as was done
in Oakland, was not pursued.
The exact amount of this Increase has
not yet been figured out, but Town Clerk
Thomas estimates that it will add from
tytween $250,000 to $300,000 to the total as
fevssment roll, which will make the roll
this year about 5600,000 higher than last
year.
The increases made by the board are as
follows:
BERKELEY, Aug. SL-The Town Trus
tees, sitting as a board of equalization,
have raised the assessed valuation of
nearly all of the residence portion of Kiist
and North Berkeley, Increasing the llg
ures of Assessor Wells from 10 to 20 per
cent. By the increases announced the
Trustees have added something over J250.
000 to the valuation of the property of the
town.
AGED CHARACTER
DIES A PAUPER
/This move is being made In the Interests
of economy, for.it wllldo away with the
two expensive freight transfer boats that
are now operated between the. AVest Oak
land-, yards and San V Francisco. These
boats, '.the Transit Â¦â¢ and â¢Â¦.Thoroughfare,
were built when the road .was completed
to Oakland and were on the same general
plan as the Solano, though not as large.
They were expensive, to -build v and have
been expensive to maintain. ' though at
the time of their -construction they were
believed to . furnish the only means by
which cars could be 4ransf erred across
the bar. 'Â¦-.' 'Â¦'. Â¦â¢ . "Â¦ .
It is now proposed to imitate the sys
tem inaugurated by the Santa Fe â large
barges towed by a tug taking the place
of the transfer boats. The cost of the
barges Is very little compared with the
cost of the transfer boats, . - which are
costly hulls filled with valuable machin
ery. The two boats have nearly reached
the limit of their term of usefulness, and
this is deemed the proper- time to make
the chance. . _<â.".,,,
The construction of the barges will be
begun at West Oakland this week.
The ferry steamer Newark is on the
ways at the West Oakland ship yard, but
owing to the Btrike the new boilers or
dered from the Risdon Iron Works can
not be completed. As a result all of the
carpenters on the Newark have been laid
off because no more work can be done un
til the boilers are put in place.
The Sovftherri Pacific; Company, is going
to abandon - the present expensive ferry
boat transfer system by which its freight
cars are ferried across the bay from Oak
land to San Francisco and will build >
series of barges that will be towed

The entertainment and social that was
given on the 20th of August under the aus
pices of the Twentieth Century Club of
the Ancient Order of Foresters were at
tended by a large number of the members
of the order and strangers,' who- greatly
enjoyed the entertainment that was pres
ent. This:club is making arrangements to
have a grand bazaar in the near future.
An active committee haa been appointed
to arrange for r this event. .
The first entertainment and dance given
by the Laundry Wagon Drivers in Odd
Fellows' Hall, August 20, was attended by
as many as could crowd Into the hall.
There was a very entertaining programme
and at the close thereof there were more
dancers on the floor than there has been
in that hall for many years. It was a
great success In every way and the credit
of it is due in the main to the committee
of arrangements, consisting - of Charles
Packer, A. Hovey, R. L. Hale, W. J.
Flannagan and J. J. Carroll.

On the 26th of August the supreme offi

witnessed the initiation of a candidate by
the drill team, which is a recent Innova

three applications -were received and
there were addresses by Supreme Presi
dent Mrs. Reed and other supreme offi
cers. The social that was given in the
Red Men's* building on the 29th inst. was
a pleasant affair. There was a short pro
gramme of entertainment and a well
arranged one of dances.
Friends of the Forest.
At a meeting of Relnhold Richter Camp,
Spanish-American War Veterans, on the
27th of August, the following named were
admitted as new members: Colonel Thom

Connelly, Captain W. H. Tobin, Lieuten
ant T. P. O'Brien and Lieutenant F. W.
Newbert, late of the First California Vol
unteers, and Private J. J: Toussey of the
Fourteenth United States Infantry. These
candidates were, after admission Into the
camp, submitted to the nerve test, which
they stood well, and in a few moments
after were required to ! defend certain
charges that weie read to them in connec
tion with their service in the Philippines.
They proved the falsity of the accusation,
were then admitted into full membership,
and each was presented with a button of
patriotic design, symbolic of the.order.

and, though she knew it, she. could not
very well give him a hint on the situation.
She was willing, because she had ar

is not nearly so hard to please as she
might have been at some other time, but
he was and went away without a

He was gone a long 1 , long time, and
when he came back he found her still

"Well, for goodness* sake,' Henry," she

The Juggernaut of the Rail.
In the thirteen years ending June 30;
1900, according to official report, the rail
roads of the United States killed 86,277
people, an average of 6,636 a year. "Bar
ring the years of our great Civil "War,"
the New. York' "World notes, "war haa
not done for us anything like this deadly
work. In the twelve greatest battles of
that war the Union loss In killed was only
about 25,000." The steam Juggernaut of
the West appears to be rather more
effective than his clumsy and creeping
prototype of the Far East. â Charleston

Grand Army of the Republic, had been
invited to join with James A. Garfleld

a happy reunion of these patriotic or

A meeting held at Fleming last night
was attended by all the union and non
union miners in camp. The men. both
union and non-union, are unanimously
in favor of abiding by the decision of the
District and National boards. The report
that armed guards were being secured to
protect property against violence re
ceived little attention at the hands of the
district officers.
Notwithstanding the confident state
ments that President Richardson and the
district board have issued regarding the
situation, there is airundercurrent of feel
ing that all is not well and that the na
tional board had received information
that a large percentage of the men will
refuse to obey orders. The strike order
will not be issued until the national board

The reports that the Vickers-Maxlm
Company had made several secret and
important additions to Holland's inven
tions are apparently untrue.
With a laudable desire to enliven the
dullness of the papers here during Lon
don's empty season, one daily has-been
endeavoring to get up a scare over the
subject of Great Britain's overwhelming
deficiency of submarine boats. Among
the alleged primes it attributes to the
Admiralty is: that of allowing the United
States- to secure this week a- submarine
invention which the Admiralty declined
Â«ven to examine, and which is likely to
revolutionize that method of warfare. A
correspondent of The Call has ascertained
that the invention in question, examined
and declined by the Admiralty, was sub
mitted to the United States naval at
tache,'Commander Clover, and was for
warded by him in the usual routine to
Washington. The * endorsement accom
panying it .-nd the opinion of other naval
experts. renders it highly improbable that
the invention v/ill: receive any more con
sideration from the Navy Department at
Washington than from the British Ad
miralty,, which, by the way, are .busily
engaged in getting their Holland boats
ready- for â¢ launching. They have called
for volunteers to man the submarine
boats, but only a few adventurous spirits
have responded, and almost all of . these,
have been rejected on account of inability
to pass the. severe medical tests imposed
in this class of the service. It is quite
probable that five Holland boats will bo
ready for launching before their crews
are secured.
j LONDON, .Aug. 31.â Seldom have so
many war vessels appeared
simultaneously in English ports. Scarcely
had the Hartford and Essex arrived in
the Thames tb-day.,before the Chicago e*r
cited 1 the curiosity, of Portsmouth citizens.
Then" th s.Dixie arrived at- Southampton
and now the Buffalo's crew are being
entertained at Greenock. The Hartford
and Essex have since left, but the others
remain. They, are all receiving the most
hospitable .treatment, but the English
officers regret that the vessels could not
all come to one port so that the welcome
could have. been organized. The officers
are also :puzzled at the fact that the
European squadron at present consists of
the lonely little Chicago and that Rear
Admiral Cromv/ell haa no control of or
even communication with other American
vessels now in. England. Â¦Â¦ >
I The arrival of the Mayor and Corpor
ation of Soutnampton in full regalia
alongside the Dixie created intense inter
est among the Western lads who are
learning to be jackies. Such an array of

The programme of what a French girl
may or may not do is drawn up very pre
cisely. Unless she is poor and has to earn
her own living she never goes out alone.
The company of. a friend of her own age
would not be sufficient to chaperon her.
It is an established rule that novel-reading
is a rare exception. She is entirely sub
ject to her parents' will In the matter of
reading. And if she asks to see anything
at the theater except a classical master
piece, or an opera, they will tell her that
such a thing is not considered proper,
feeling Â¦ sure of her silent : submission.
After she Is 15 years old she is generally
allowed to be in the drawing-room on her
mother's reception days, but must keep

her apprenticeship. She has but few jew

Custom does not permit her to wear cost

worth speaking of for her personal Â¦ use.

In the evening the Vice President was

a number of prominent Chicagoans, in the
main members of the Merchants' Club. .
Roosevelt absolutely refused to talk on

steered away from the subject of his pos

To-morrow he will breakfast with Paul

will be spent privately. He will leave to
morrow night for Minneapolis.
After the Dorothea came to anchor at

before Santiago, with whom he renewed
acquaintance.

here after his arrival at 7:30 o'clock this
morning. The morning was taken up with
a breakfast at the Chicago Club, tendered
by Senator Cullom, and by private busi
ness of the Vice President.
These somewhat large proportions are
due principally to the presence among
males of voting age of a large number of
illiterate persons of- negro descent in
Ncrth Carolina and of illiterate Indians
In New Mexico. In both New Jersey and
New York the proportion of illiterates is
much less, or 6.9 per cent in the former
State and 5.9 per cent In the latter.
The actual foreign-born males of voting
age constitute in New York 38.4 per cent,
in New" Jersey S5.7 per cent and In New
Mexico 13.8 per cent of the entire number.
Among males of voting age as a whole
there is a considerable proportion of illit
erates in North Carolina and New Mexico,
the percentage for the former State being
29.4 and for the latter 28.3 per cent.
WASHINGTON*. Aug. 31.â The census
bureau has issued a bulletin giving the
number of persons of school, militia and
voting ages in the States of New York.
New Jersey, North Carolina and the Ter
ritory of New Mexico for the census year
1500. According to this statement foreign
white persons of school age constitute in
New York 12 per cent and native white
persons of foreign parentage 42. S per cent,
the two elements together representing
upward of one-half or. 54.8 per cent of the
whole number of persons of school age
in 1900. These same two elements con
stitute in New Jersey 49.1 per cent and
in New Mexico 12.9 per cent of all persons
of school age.
The 400 union coopers employed in Kan
sas City on Thursday presented. a re
quest for an Increase in wages from 27&
cents to 30 cents an hour. The Cudahy
Company at once discharged the ten
coopers in its employ. One hundred and
twenty-five Cudahy butchers are on
strike. Â¦
The request, as Donnelly calls it, was
made first at Chicago. It was laid before
the Armour management there with a
view of covering the Armour plants at
Kansas 1 City, Chicago and. Omaha. It
was made on Nelson Morris & Co., to
cover their branch houses in St. Joseph
and St. Louis; on Swift & Co., to-cover
the plants at Chicago, Omaha, Kansas
City, St. Joseph, St. Louis' and St. Paul;
on Cudahyat Omaha, to cover both that
point and Kansas City; on the Hammond
Packing Company at Hammond, Ind., to
Include St. Joseph and the Omaha Pack
ing Company at Omaha, which has its
cattle killed at the Fowler Packing
House in Kansas City. The only Kansas
City packing house which was served
with a Â¦ copy of the request was the
Schwarzschild & Sulzberger Packing
Company. This company has its head
quarters in this city.
Donnelly said the relations with the
packers were pleasant and they will be
given ample time to consider the request.
Donnelly insists that it is not a demand
and declares that reports of a threatened
strike are misleading. He would not say
what action will be taken in the event
the request is denied.
The increase would raise the .wages of
some of the workmen, such as the skin
ners and splitters, from the present
schedule of 45 cents an hour to 50 cents.
The membership of the organization in
all the cities where It is represented is
16,000. At Kansas City 1500 men will be
benefited by the advance in wages if it
is granted. No increase is asked for men
employed in other departments.
Donnelly said that the proposition had
been laid before the packers in the form
of a request and they would not be asked
for a reply until after Labor .day. It
applies only to the butchers and their
helpers in the beef killing departments
of the packing houses and involves an
advance of 10 per cent in the wages of
the men employed on the cattle beds.

"Count Lamsdorff," he says, "finds no
difficulty in teiling our Government in
the plainest language permitted by diplo
macy that if it does not like the Russian
arrangements in Manchuria, for example,
it is at liberty to resent them hi any way
it pleases. Russia is not disposed to ob
ject, but it quite prepared to tight."
Frederick Greenwood, founder and
formerly editor of the Pall Mall Gazette
and St. James Gazette, and who is re
garded as an acul* and far-seeing ob
server of foreign affairs, analyzes in the
Daily Mail to-day the recent blue books
on Chinese affairs, -particularly the facts
concerning the Russian seizure of the
Peking-Shanhalkwan Railroad.
"We must strive for a final settlement
with Russia or gird ourselves for a
figrht." and the Times editorially says
Great Britain must decide whether It is
"compatible with our interests, commer
cial and political, to allow a foreign
power like Russia to establish itself on
the PÂ«rcian Gulf. Possibly It may be ex
pedient to purchase political peace ' by
the surrender of commercial interests
which might cost too much to defend.
But If we are resolved to defend them,
we must not await until it is too late to
declare our intentions and take action."
LOXDOX, Aup. SI.â Russian agents In
Persia are interfering with the QuÂ»Â»tta-
JCushkl trade route between India and
Eastern Persia, opened by the Indian
Government. According to a Times dis
patch from Simla, Russia, by virtue of a
loan contracted in 1900, has effective con
trol of the customs and is giving endless
worry and trouble to traders, -by means
cf customs regulations, especially quar
antine restrictions. It is possible for Rus
sia to paralyze British trade by long de
tentions of caravans. and travelers. The
native belief that Russian influence is
supreme in Eastern .Persia is having a
bad political effect.

in the Delaware River last Wednesday
has now leached twenty-one. Sixteen
bodies have been identified and five still
await identification at the morgue. Eight
bodies were recovered to-day in the vicin
ity of the disaster. Nine persons are
missing and the unidentified are probably
among the number.
The bodies Identified were those of
Marian Aehmead, aged 16 years; Anna B.
Herr, aged 1G years; Mrs. Matilda Cross,
21 years; Mrs. Alice Matthews, 41 years;
Irene Wield, 16 years; Dora Wield, 12
years, all of Philadelphia; Harry Johnson,
aged 36 years. Hulmeville, Pa., and Mont
gomery Marvel, 24 years old, Seaford,
The Federal and local Inspectors to-day
began investigation of the City of Tren
ton, which is docked at Neafie & Levy's
ship yard. The port boiler, which ex
ploded. Is still at the bottom of the river,
having been blown out of the boat.
BOSTON, Aug. 31.â A special ' from
Cataumet to the Herald says: . It is rather
unusual for four persons in one family to
meet death within a period of one month.
Yet this occurred in the case of Mr." and
Mrs. Alden P. Davis and their two
daughters, Mrs. Irving:. Gibbs and Mrs.
Harry Gordon, the latter of Chicago, the
deaths taking place only a few weeks ago.
Some one started a rumor that these
persons, or at least two of them, did not
die from natural causes. Finally the Dis
trict Attorney ordered . an investigation
and Joseph Whitney j of the State police
force was -Instructed to conduct an au
topsy on the bodies of Mrs. Gordon and
Mrs. Gibbs. An undertaker exhumed the
bodies yesterday and an autopsy was held
in the presence of medical experts, in
cluding State 'Examiner Paunce, State
Detective .Whitney, Professor Whitney
and Professor Wood of Harvard College.
While Professor Wood had undoubtedly
been engaged by Captain Paul Gibbs to
attend; the autopsy, he was also present
as an expert - employed by the State and
to his custody were intrusted the organs
of the two bodies for chemical analysis.
This, ~. In the minds of many, shows that
the authorities are looking for poison. The
fact that the Jacon House, which was tha
home of the Davis family, was set on fire
four or five times during the interval be
tween the death of Mrs. Davis and her
younger daughter is considered as having
an Important bearing on the case. '
Whether the bodies of Mr. , and Mrs
Davis are to be exhumed depends on the
result of the autopsy held. yesterday. Thje
result will not be made known for several
days.' â¢ .'Â¦'â¢'Â¦.' '" " Â¦
SALT LAKE. Utah, Aug. 31.â A special
to the Herald from Denver says that the
Colorado and Northwestern Railway is to
be. extended to Salt Lake City. The an
nouncement is made by Thomas H. Mann,
who has Just returned from "Chicago,
where he haa been in conference, with
Colonel S. B. Dick, one of the projectors
and builders of the Colorado and North
western, and who recently gained control
of the stock of the road. The new road
ia to be standard gauge throughout and
it will be one of the important links of
a new transcontinental system.
It Is intimated that an understanding
already exists between Senator W. A.
Clark and the financiers behind the Colo
rado and Northwestern enterprise by
which the Clark road from Southern" Cal
ifornia and the Northwestern will form
one system from the Pacific Coast. ' The
distance between Salt Lake and Denver,
it Is claimed, will be reduced 200 miles by
the proposed route. .

REV. HENRY MARTYN HART.
D.D., rector of St. John's Cathe
dral, dean of Denver and head of
the clerical delegation to the tri-*"
ennial convention of the Episco
pal church, which meets In this city on
October 2 ranks as the most eloquent and
learned divine of his denomination west
of the Mississippi River. To the accom
plishment of a finished pulpit orator he
combines equal attainments as a scholar
in Greek and a thorough knowledge of the
abstruse physical sciences.
In 1S72, when broken In health from over
work, he made a tour of the world, visit
ing California en route and acquiring a
high impression of the wonderful re
sources and scenic attractions of this
Visiting Denver, he preached to the con
gregation in old St. John's Church and
produced so marked an impression that a
call was extended to him to remain as
rector. Several years later the call was,
renewed and a salary named that is re
ceived by but few clergymen in the
United States. The dean at that time was
the incumbent of a parish at Blackheath,
London, and head master of a flourishing
school for boys, and to accept the call
from Denver involved heavy financial sac
rifice, but esteeming the call as one by
divine inspiration and charmed with the
prospect of ministering In a new and re
sourceful country, it was accepted.
The old church soon gave way to a
stately cathedral, classic in design and
enriched with costly and appropriate or-

namentatlon, Seating 1500 persons, and is
none too large for the great congregations
which crowd the edifice at every service,
all thrilled with sentiments of admiration
toward the gifted and eloquent, rector.
The dean is practical in all his methods,
aggressive in his ministerial work and a
hater of all pretense and shams. Liberal,
as a churchman, he is equally popular in
all the denominations. Known and ad
mired on both continents the distinction
is universally accorded the gifted dean of
being- the first citizen of enterprising and
progressive Denver.
Dean Hart by- birth is a "Yorkshire
man" where his father is Vicar of Otley,
and is a graduate of Trinity College, Dub
lin. "While incumbent at Blackheath the
dean orlgina-ted a scheme of charity or
ganization which was adopted in that
populous community and met with such
unprecedented results as to completely
modify former practices for dealing with
tiie subject in great cities, and has been
adopted in all the great municipalities of
the world. Dean Hart's voice will be
heard in all Jthe great debates of the con
vention, ani? among the churches he will
be in demand as preacher.
The greatest social function ever
planned in California will be the recep
tion to be accorded the delegates to the
general convention . of the t Episcopal
church. Seventy bishops, coming from
every State and Territory in the United
States, a Spiritual Lord Bishop of Great
Britain, four hundred of the greatest
preachers of the church in America and
as many laymen will attend the conven

The reception probably will be held In
the. Hopkins. Art Institute on account of
its great size and accessibility and its
splendid collection of art treasures, which
would add much to the enjovment of the
occasion. The opportunity that will be
given at the Hopkins mansion for a mag
nificent floral display will be fully em
ployed. It is expected to astonish the dis
tinguished visitors by an exhibition of
floral beauty and sumptuousness that
they will remember all their lives. Sev
eral string bands are to be engaged for
the occasion, all under the direction of
Mr. Eaton, the new and accomplished
organist of Trinity Church. If possible
an elaborate electrical display will be
made a feature of the decorations,
While impossible at this time to fix
a date upon which the reception will be
held, it will probably be on Wednesday
evening, October 9.
Nearly every delegate will be accom

AL.TOONA, Pa., Aug. 31.â At Munson, a
mining town north of this city, Emanuel
Renus, a German miner, was emptying
powder from one cask to another at his
home when a spark fell from his pipÂ© into
the powder. The explosion which fol

CALL. BUREAU, 1406 O BTRKET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.â On auggea
tibn by the local department, the question
of dividing the mall route between Ogden
and San lYanclaco haa been discussed at
Washington during a period covering
nearly a year, and It has now been decided
to establish a station at Reno, Nev. This
will affect forty-five clerks In the railway
mall service, and -thirty-two of them will
have to go to Ogden to live. The new ar
rangement will facilitate the distribution
of mail and insure better service for San
Francisco. It will also be a great con
venience to the clerks. ' . - ' --. Â¦- .
Previously it has been necessary for the
clerks to work thirty hours going from
and thirty-one hours proceeding to San
Francisco on the fastest trains. . The trip
has taken nine days. The distance from
San Francisco to Ogden is 835 miles. From
Ogden to Reno the distance Is 589 miles
and Reno Is 244 miles from San Francisco."
Sixty men are employed on the line.
Hereafter there- will be four crews at
San Francisco and six crews at Ogden.
Men will be transferred from Ogden to
San Francisco as fast as possible, the
transfers being dependent upon seniority.
The new arrangement was approved only
after mature consideration. The men will
be benefited as there will be.eome promo
tions to make captains for the new crews.

Tho Prune crop of California this year is
estimated at . 55,000,000 lbs, against 170,000,000
last year. That of Oregon, ' Washington and
Idaho Is placed at 27,000,000 lbs. These with a
carry-over of about 25,000,000 lbs, give' a total
Prune crop for the whole Paciflc'Coast of only
107,000,000 lbs, or considrably less than half the
output of last- year. This, showing, coupled
with i a decreased European crop, is what
causes the present stiff market and good de

The market has been quiet and featureless
for a week, owing largely to the cool and foggy
weather, which always operates against the
fruit market. Melons have felt the effects of
this most and have been neglected, while
Grapes have also moved slowly. The leading
tree fruits, such as Pears, Peaches and Plums,
have kept steady, owing to the brisk call for
them for shipment, though Plums have been
showing more or less weakness for some days,
and medium and' lower qualities have been
somewhat slow. Oranges, Lemons and Limes
continue quiat, they, too, being largely depend
ent upon the weather for their, sale.

Dried Fruits in New York.
Â¦ -Mall reports from New York say:
"For roost descriptions a fair Jobbing de
xnand is noted through the list. -On spot ral-
Blns the firmness noticed for several days past
continues. Sellers' views are around 7%c to
8c en seeded, with some purchases noted on
the coast to come East at C*ic. There Is re
.portÂ«-d to be only a moderate supply of seed
ed here, and other neaxby markets- are said
to be reluctant sellers. '. Loose raisins offer
ing from the coast at 5%c for 2 crown are said
to be for mincemeat purposes only. Three
crown on the epot are firm at 6&c. We hear
of a little buying of seedless muscatels at 6%c
In round lots, the same, it* Is believed, being
Intended for u*e by mincemeat makers. It
Is reported that some business Is pending for
a round lot. In imported raisins the market
cor.tinues without prominent feature. In some
quarters sultanas are said to be a little firmer.
Ne'.v crcp Valencia raisins are offered to ar
rive at Sc. We note a steady situation in cur
rants on the spot, and a little Jobbing Interest
Is reDOrted on the basis of 9c for Amelias In
barrels. There is no Important buying noted,
however. New crop is attracting little inter
est, and it seems now established that first
ehipments will not leave by direct boat be
fore early September. In prunes spot is steady
and generally pretty firm. Some sales of 40-50s
ara noted at 7c. A little buying of old fruit
t. o. b. Coast is reported on the S!Â«c basis
lor the four sizes. New fruit possesses little
attraction for buyers here at the moment We
hear cf quotations en new (outside) at 3Uc
basis for Visalia and 3%c for Santa Clara.
Association opening has not been fixed. .In
apricots arrivals of new receive a little atten
tion, buyers taking goods In email lots, appar
ently ar wanted. Offers of choice Royals are
available on the Sc basis in 25-lb boxes from
one quarter, and 12%c is asked for fancy
Moorparks, also in 25-lb boxes. â¢ Peaches are
quiet for both new and old. In nuts, outside
cf a little, firmness noted In Brazil nuts, the
market offers little feature to-day. A little
buying of new crop California almonds Is re
ported. Imported almonds are quiet, with a
moderate Interest in futures."

ments of J34S.500 for bonds and of $913,000 for
pensions. These items make a total of $2,763,
7C0. The sub-treasury received from the banks
$1,850,000 for transfer to the interior, leaving
$9,131,700 net gain to the banks on extraordinary
operations. Receipts by the sub-treasury for
customs, internal revenue and other items
were $18,925,000, while the disbursements to the
banks for ordinary purposes were $14,305,300,
leaving an excess of receipts over payments by
the sub-treasury of $4,823,700. The banks
shipped directly to the Interior, chiefly to Chi
cago, $5,9S8,S0O, exclusive of transfers which
are included in the above statement, and the
banks received . from the interior $4,385,300.
leaving* as the . net loss to the- banks on this
direct movement $1,607,500. Adding the net loss
to the banks of $3,7in,50O on sub-treasury opera
tions, both ordinary and extraordinary, ' makes
the total loss of cash by the banks for the
week $5,314,000. The bank returns showed a loss
of $6,235,100 in cash. The loans were expanded
by $7,349,200. There was a decrease of only
$27,S00 in deposits, whereas there should have
been shown an increase of $1,114,100. The cir
culation gained $1,0%9.SOO, and the loss In sur
plus reserve was $6,2SS,175, leaving this Hem
at $11,919,925. There was good evidence early
last week that some of the $4,000,000 cash which
had been sent to Philadelphia late in the pre
vious week had been returned to this city. It
will be observed that the drain of money into
the treasury from the banks for customs and
Internal revenue was quite large last week and
this movement may continue Important in the
near future. In t=uch a case a concurrent move
ment to the interior tot crop purposes would
very soon seriously reduce the surplus reserves.
It Is true that the Assistant Treasurer has
been given authority to buy bonds to large
amounts should they be offered, but judging
from the comparatively small tenders of bonds
which were made last week relief to the mar
ket through bond purchases, should relief be
needed, would be quite ineffective. Any ma
terial advance In rates for money as the re
sult of these conditions would be almost cer
tain to cause such a fall in foreign exchange
rates as to bring gold from Europe. This
would afford far more effective relief to the
market than any other available method.

The appraisers who are investigating the
valves Â¦ of the oil properties in Kern
County are not more, than half through
with their task. They appear to be pro
ceeding in a way to find out the facts to
their entire satisfaction. "If a company."
says' the Californlan, "claims that its
wells are producing 1500 barrels dally and
Its shipments are but 900 barrels, the gen
tlemen at once try to determine what has
become of the missing. 600. barrels. After
this question is disposed of a careful In
spection of each producing well Is made
and a record of the strata encountered In
drilling is noted.. Even the ; minutest de
tails are taken notice of, as, for example,
the method' of perforating the casing."
Statements are taken; from the superin
tendents : of the ; several . producing com
panies as the starting point in .the inves
tigation, and the next step Is to verify the
reports as received. The appraisers have
now. been employed in " Kern â¢ County
something more than a fortnight. /
. The Santa Barbara Press says that
there will be active development of- oil
lands In the northern , part of Santa- Bar
bara' County in .the .immediate, future.
The latest" company to take tha field is
operating in the Jalama Canyon on the
Dibblee ranch., A- location was made by
A.- S. Cooper for the first well. ' â¢:â¢ â¢
"It now begins to look," says the Ba
kersfield Californlan, "that the renewal
of activity which was predicted In the
local field in summer is near at hand, and
it is no longer a guess when it is stated
that the next few months will bring a
revival of development and general work
In the oil fields." â¢
Predicting Activity.
The Williams Farmer reports that the
oil companies in Colusa. County are mak
ing progress. According. to the Farmer's
account the Smith & ,Gorrill Company,
operating twelve miles southwest of Wil
liams, on lands leased from the Colusa
County Bank, has two wells down 400 to
600 feet. The company is drilling a third
hole. The Colusa Oil Company, operating
ten miles northwest from Williams, is
down 300 feet and has suspended opera
tions for a time but will resume soon. The
Williams Oil Company is nine miles west
of Williams and is drilling there and has
a hole about 400 feet deep. The R. H. Her
ron well. is twenty-four miles west from
Williams. This is not working because of
a shortage of the water supply. The Bear
Valley Oil and Development Company is
twelve miles southeast from Williams and
Is on the H. P. Eakle lease. The well is
down 276 feet. The crew has been dis
missed. The Cahalls Oil and Mining Com
pany is operating twenty-eight miles west
from Williams, on land owned by the
company. The drill is down about 200
feet. The Minor Ranch Oil Company is
down 1 200 feet, having drillers under, con
tract at a stipulated price per foot. ' The
Gibson Oil Company has a standard rig
rusting on Bear Creek, twenty-four miles
west from Williams, while the courts are
considering litigation affecting the com
pany. The lease of lands by A. A. 1 Gib
son and * his partner, Martin, according
to the Farmer, expired August 10.
The Hollister" Bee reports that the
Calistoga' Oil -and Development Company
has sunk 570 feet in â¢ the Vallecitos .Val
ley and that work is being carried on
night and day.
J. E. Ha verstick, president of the
Rockhill Iron and Coal Company of
Pennsylvania," evidently believes . that
coke can be made in California from
the coal and- oils of the. San Joa
quin Valley. In a letter 'â¢ addressed
to. the "secretary, of the Chamber of
Commerce of Stockton, Haverstick writes
that there is considerable movement of
coke from Pennsylvania to the Pacific
Coast. It seems to him that by mixing
coal and oil there may be an opening for
the manufacture of coke near Stockton.
He asked many questions concerning the
feasibility of establishing a coke plant
close to Stockton. Haverstick's letter,
having been read before a meeting of the
Stockton Chamber of Commerce, the sec
retary of the" chamber was instructed to
forward the desired Information without
delay. Â¦Â¦Â¦'.. Â¦ Â¦._ ,

In the Kern River field there la less than
one weir to five acres, of proven land. In the
McKlttrick field the case Is practically the
same, while In Midway there are thousands of
acres â¢ of unproven land, which is almost cer
tain to prove very valuable. \ In Sunset there
is a great stretch of valuable land. There are
thousands of acres of demonstrated land In the
Ventura County fields, and the same Is true
of the Newhall field in Los Angeles County.
In this city there is little valuable land, except
for deepening purposes, unless it lies in direc
tions as yet undemoristrated. This much seems
to be known to all persons Interested In oil,
but to many of them the idea j seems to pre
vail-that there is hot so great an area of
proven land in tha fields further southâ"WTiit
tler, Puente and Fullertoh. There are many oil
men in. the State who do not realize what im
mense values lie in that quarter. In -the Whlt
tier field alone there is now land practically
proven to be the equal of anything in Califor
nia which affords room for more wells than
have been drilled in the Los Angeles field in all
time, and the boundaries- of the field are by no
means fixed. â¢ . - \
Something has stimulated the sale bt
shares of stock, in California oil com
panies on the exchanges in this city and
also In Los Angeles recently. Prices
have risen in-some- instances and Â¦ the
sales have been larger in volume. The
prevailing cause is probably the- belief,
which seems tq be quite general, that the
prices for oil will improve as the result
of the combinations of well owners: In
some quarters doubt is expressed wheth
er another spurt in development work
would not have the tendency to interfere
with . the restoration of prices. At â¢ least
one scheme that has been proposed Â¦ to
the oil operators had as its main idea the
proposition that the committee J which
was to have charge of the marketing of
the oil produced by an association should
also have the right to provide what the
output should be. Evidently, there are
problems enough in the oil business to
engage attention on the part of the own
ers of properties and their, advisers for
a considerable period. The Los Angeles
Herald says that the operators who have
supplied it with information do not con
sider the ; present an opportune time to
resume development work. There is
enough ."demonstrated" oil land in the
State to afford work for five to ten times
the wells that have been drilled. â¢ There
is much land where It is necessary to
drill regardless of price, on account' of
leases, which ; insures a considerable in
crease in production entirely regardless
of the demand for oil. The Herald says:
Some Cause Gives Stocks a
Lift and Measure pf
Activity.

Bank clearings continue to gain over last year.
Produce and Bond exchanges not in session.

"There are several parties \ within the

timber and making It* into shakes, which
they are delivering to our local lumber
yards. In the last three weeks about 40,-
O00 shakes have .been brought here. The
Government, Â¦ when it set" apart the park,
declared that the big sugar pine and fir
trees were intended to protect the snow.
bo that when those -on the plains who were
near the rivers and -irrigation districts
would have water " during the warm
months. No doubt those who are cutting
this fine timber have Government patents
to the land, notwithstanding it is within
the National Park. We think that those
â¢who hold patents should look to their rep
resentatives in Congress for relief, and
they should be paid by the Government

phatic protest has again come against
the destruction of the forests crowning
the high Sierras. This latest protest was
caused by the shipment of some 40,000

for $4000 worth of the supplementary

SIERRA FORESTS
BEING DENUDED
SUPPLEMENTARY
BOOKS LACKING
LEASE SIGNED
FOR NEW SITE
A military patrol Is maintained during
the summer season In the Yosemite Na
tional Park to prevent depredations and
timber cutting. But the jurisdiction of
the military does not extend over the sec
tions on which patents have been issued.
Efforts will be made by the Sierra Club,
the California Water and' Forest Asso
ciation and the Yosemite Commissioners
to prevent any further destruction of the
forests in the immediate vicirflty of the
valley.-
--"This property from which these shakes
were cut," said Secretary J. J. Lermen,
"are- located about thirteen miles from
the valley. .The land has been patented
by Its owners, and while they are no
doubt within their rights in -cutting the
timber thereon, we hope for the -good, of
the State that Congress will take some
action preventing any further destruction
of these forests." -Â¦.>â¢;
"Some of the sections were offered to
the Government for sale, but so far as
we know have not been taken back.
Some of the land is inaccessible, but the
owners are compelled to pay taxes on
it. I suppose it is from some section ac
cessible to a wagon road that this tim
ber was brought. In most cases, how
ever, the removal of timber- is not per
mitted by the Government. Our orders
regarding this cutting of timber are very
strict. . as far as our Jurisdiction In the
valley extends, and we would gladly co
operate in any way with the Government
for a Â» further preservation of the ad
jacent timber. It is not alone a matter
that ' Interests the people of Merced, but
all the inhabitants of the great plains
of the San Joaquln Valley are dependent
upon the preservation of these trees for
their supply of water for irrigation and
domestic purposes."
Congress Must Be Looked To.
"In the popular mind," said Charles
G. Clinch of the State Yosemite Valley
Commission, "some confusion exists as
to the control exercised over the valley
and the land adjacent thereto. "We have
control of the valley proper, while the
iUnited States Government has control
of the national park. Immediately sur
rounding the valley. Before the Govern
ment-acquired control of the park a num
ber of people had taken up land there
and proceeded to make use of it as best
they could.
and on which they have had to pay taxes
to the counties the land Is in, without any
other privileges."
The teacher against whom charges have
been filed with the Board of Education
by John Lyser, principal of . the John
Swett Grammar School, is Miss Mary C.
McKinney. She is charged with' general
incompetency and unfltness for - teaching,
and the charges will be investigated by
Superintendent "Webster. Miss McKinney
has been transferred no less than" eight
times in the last six years, and the prin
cipals who recommended her transfer say
that it was for Incompetency.
One of the members of the board, who
does not wish his name known, says that
there are at least twelve other teachers
who are Incapable of fulfilling their duties
and that â¢ it is almost certain . that they
will be dismissed after a hearing. - The
trial of Miss Dwyer, accused of having
a bad temper, will begin before the board
on Tuesday morning.
The date of the oral examination for
applicants for, teachers' positions will be
held on. September 14 instead of Septem
ber 13, as â¢heretofore announced. â¢Â¦ .
The board has distributed its rules for
the conduct of the examinations for elect-
Ing new teachers in the department. The
rules do not differ in any essential- par
ticular with those already published when
the plan was adopted. - . f

; The present trustees are going to make
another fight= for it and are particularly
sanguine.- Trustee L. H. Bonestell said
yesterday that all Idea of combining with

and the burden had grown almost beyond
their power to carry, when the trustees a
few years ago sold their down town prop
erty and .built on the site they are now
leaving. ;
And change the law they did. In 1870
Governor Haight signed a bill authorizing
the lottery scheme. The lottery was a
success. The proceeds paid all outstand
ing debts and left a balance on hand of
$20,000.
. Camilla Urso volunteered her services.
trot up a benefit concert and turned over
20,000.. This was only a drop in the bucket,
however.soitwas decided to adopt heroic
measures. A lottery was suggested.
. "It's against the law." was the cry.
Â¦-.. "Let's change the law," was the an
swer. ' Â¦Â¦**
"We will get life into the old ship," say
the trustees. "We will clear her decks
of debt, remodel her on up to date lines
and with a good slant of the wind of
popular approval and support will sail her
to her proper place at the head of the
library fleet."
There Is probably no other Institution
in Ran Francisco so closely associated
with the early history -of the city. 'The
Mercantile Library was , started in 1852
in the days when the saloon was the only
Eubllc resort of a social nature, the gam
ling table the only recognized pastime
for leisure hours and news of the outside
world an event of infrequent occurrence.
Irving M. Scott, although not an original
trustee, was one of the prime movers in
the library movement.
Rooms ' were engaged in the California
Exchange building at the. corner of Clay
and Kearny streets. Â¦ These quarters suf
ficed until 1S65, when with $22,000 on hand
the trustees purchased the lot on Bush
street where the telephone company's
main office now stands. They, borrowed
$100,000 and when the building was com
pleted found : themselves comfortably

The library's new quarters on Sutter
