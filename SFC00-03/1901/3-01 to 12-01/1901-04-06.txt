WANT THEIR JUDGES
TO WEAR SHIRT WAISTS
of the executive committee of the Indian
apolis Bar Association a resolution was
Introduced and adopted after some dis
cussion asking the Judges of the Superior
and Circuit Courts to wear shirt waists
after May 1.
The reason assigned for this action Is
that the trial of cases during the heated
term Is attended with great Inconvenience
because of the' heat, and that If the
Judges would consent to wear shirt waist3
the attorneys would generally conform to
the custom an-J there woufd be no neces

when trying causes In the hot months.

ies arc heavily capitalized. The Alaska

the corporation representing the combined

will be greatly benefited. This city. will b?
made the supply,. point; and very largely
the point of departure for the vessels of
the fleet. . : â¢
The business for the .Yukon country and
for the gold camps generally
yield a big revenue to 'this city. As busi
ness increases,- which .is. inevitable, 'the

Fine Outlook for Money-Making.
Considering- that the outputsbf gold of
the Klondike country alone was 113,000,000
"in round figures last year and "that Alaska
is incalculably rich in gold, copper ami
coa*. it viii at once appear that the new
corporation will practically control tho
business ; of a great section, which will
largely increase from year to year, unless
all signs fail. The importance of the ne
gotiations caused Michael Cudahy to Jour
ney from Chicago to San Francisco, when*
he has been in consultation with the other
principal parties concerned in controlling
tho trade. 3* - .
From the fir.it publicity has been avoid
ed as much as possible. -In addition ttÂ»
the war of rates between traders, which,
has tended to disturb the even course of
the business in Alaska, there have been
other matters that, have led up to tho
present condition of affairs. Lighterage
at Nome and strikes have brought the
companies nearer together. The present
season, under the arrangements already
made for the management of tuc trans
portation business of the Yukon, will bo
much more profitable than in previous
years.
It wa3 said last night that when all the
matters connected with the pending deal
are completed a written statement will
be given out to the press for the further

CALL - BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, jj N.
W., WASHINGTON, April 5.â Formidable
opposition has -developed to an order of
the War Department j about to be put In
effect' abolishing permanently . the array
transport station in New York City.". The
change that will go Jnto effect.'- unless
these interests succeed in their present
effort of antagonism, will concentrate the
transport business with the Philippines
at San Francisco and turn the Cuban busi
ness over to private lines. . . . .
It is boldly charged by business men
and representative citizens; who are now
engaged in laying the case before . Presi
dent McKinley, Secretary Root and Gen
eral Ludington, ' quartermaster general,
that this move is against economy arid in
the interests of private steamship line'3
plying between: the. United States and
Cuba, Â¦ . Â¦ '"â¢" Â¦Â¦/' Â¦ - .;
Incidentally it is claimed that Pacific
railroads will profit by .the chansre at the
expense of the Government, because all
supplies sent from the East and all troop3
transported will have to make a long
journey by rail across the continent. The
influence of the Cuban steamship lines,
and especially Â¦. the "New York and .Cuban
Steamship Company, represented by R.
A. 1 C. Smith, is claimed to be the chief
factor in persuading Secretary Root to
wipe out New York: City as a transport
city. .' Â¦ - " Â¦ Â¦ -Â¦ Â¦ ' Â¦â¢â¢' - ' : ; Â¦- 'â¢

are ' working upi sentiment . agaiiist . th3
change, contending that It, is against pub
lic policy- and.* shipping.. Interests'- 5 *?? , .New;-
York. â¢â¢Â¦-â¢-. - - v^-f/^r ';- "Â¦-Â¦-â¢Â¦]Â¦ .^f /^~ iw : :;vi^--;
s Â¦The.contentidn.thatthe'abandc'nmcnt of
army transports in the" ; Cuban "service"
would enrich private steamship lines at
the expense of the Government is shown
by some figures that have Jaeen procured
from the quartermaster general's depart
ment. It â¢ is Â¦ shown that the transport
Crook made a trip to San Juan at a cost
to the .Government of $9561' 39. The cost
to the Government" if the same business
had been' given to a private line would
have been $19,507. The cost of a round trip
by an army transport between San Juan
and New York was $14,062. The cost of the
same service. by a regular line would have
been $26,419. . .
What the Government Saves.
V Again it is shown that the saving to the
Government by maintaining its own trans
port service with theWest Indies, instead
of giving the business to -a-' regular line,
from 1S98 to June 16, 1900, was $9,087,153.
This, it is pointed out. is the stake that
the private steamship Hues' are endeavor
ing to win by inducing Secretary Root to
abandon the transport station in New
York. There are three lines : engaged in
the Cuban trade. These are the Ward
ljne, Â¦ or ' New York Steamship Company,
which is maintaining sixteen vessels, eight
of which are foreign; the Munson line, all
of"" whose ships are foreign; and FuncX
Edyc & Co., all of whose liners are for
eign.
.It is understood that Â«\ delegation will
go' to Washington- to bring all of these
facts to the attention of the War Depart
ment and endeavor to have thetransporc
service continued to Cuba as wellas with
Manila by way of the Suez canal. .,

WASHINGTON, April 5.â At the meet-
Ing of the Cabinet to-day the major por
tion of -the time was consumed In a dis
cussion of the civil service in the various
departments. This matter came up apro
pos of the President's conference with
members of the Civil Service Reform
League yesterday. Each of the Cabinet
officers gave hiÂ« experience with the law.
1 The Secretary of the Treasury said that
the law gave satisfaction In his depart
ment, and that it was strictly complied
with, although some difficulty was ex
perienced on account of the fact that un
der the law officers secured for one posi
tion could not perform duties of another
position. The trouble in the Agricultural
Department Is that there are no eligibles
for. technical work on the Civil Service
Commission's list.
Secretary Root reported that It was the
intention of the War Department to place
semi-skilled . laborers at arsenals and in
the engineer department under a regis
tration system similar to that now ln
vogue in the navy yards. This was the
original intention when the President took
these men, of whom there "are several
thousand, from within, the civil service
rules, where they had been placed by the
blanket order of President Cleveland, but
the inauguration of the new'sjatem has
been delayed from one cause or another
until the present time.
In the other departments various sug
gestions were made locking to the better
enforcement of â¢ the spirit and letter of
the law. and Â¦ each Cabinet officer will be
expected to see that the law is not abused
in his department. No new regulations
or orders by the commission are expected.

price was not excessive.
In the present case the bid of the Union
Iron Works is $2,825,000, which. the board
points out Is considerably less than 4 per

WASHINGTON. April Â«--The United
States Government has received a commu
nication from the Government of Russia
of unusual importance, bearing upon.con
dltions in China, and particularly those
relating to Manchuria. 1 The document, is
of such a character as to have produced
a profoundly favorable Impression, and at
the State Department it is looked upon
as the most salutary development that
has occurred tor many months in the
problems of the Kast. A3 to the ex Â»Â«
terms of the communication there Is no
official statement thus far, although later
it will doubtless be communicated to the
President. Secretary Hay received it from
the Russian Embassador. Count Casslni
last night, and took speedy steps to lay; it
before the President. The latter shared
the Secretary of State's gratification that
a way has been found to dispose ct the
complications ever the Manchurlan ques
tion and to bring Russia into strong ac
cord with the other powers. At the Rus
sian Embassy no information was obtain
able as to the communication. Count Las
sini asking to be excused from all in
quiries. " . ,
While there Is an entire absence oZ
authoritative Information, yet it Is under
stood that Russia now takes occasion to
give positive assurance of the disinterest
ed sentiments which have animated her
throughout the consideration of the Chi
nese questions. As to Manchuria, it is
made clear that Russia's course never has
varied In the purpose to leave that pro
vince an integral part of China, and to re
tire the Russian troops as rapidly as
safety would permit. This moreover, it
Is made plain In the communication, has
been Russia's oourse throughout, notwith
standing asertions to the contrary. But
as a more signal evidence of Russia s pur
pose, and in harmony with the Czar's
aspirations for peace and harmony be
tween the nations, the Russian Govern
ment now gives assurance of the most
definite and satisfactory character as to
the execution of this purpose.
The extent of the assurance can be best
judged by the Impression made In the
highest official quarters here that the
threatened crisis over Manchuria has been
completely averted. The Russian commu
nication Is the more significant coming at
a moment when the prÂ«ss advices from
Europe assert that Russia was collecting
an army of 300,000 men for the purpose
of holding Manchuria without reference
to the desfre of the other powers. There
is no doubt that Russia has a large mili
tary force In Manchuria, so that had she
determined to hold the province she has
the military establishment already on the
ground prepared to maintain her occu
pancy. . â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
To the officials in Washington one of
the most gratifying features of Russia's
action is that it Is responsive to Secre
tary Hay's note of March 1 last. This note
had been previously communicated to the
Chinese Minister at Washington, and ad
vised him that the United States viewed
as inexpedient and dangerous to the in
terests of China the conclusion of any pri
vate territorial or financial agreement. A
copy of this communication was sent to
the United Slates Embassador at St.
Petersburg, Mr. Tower, and the Russian
Embassador at Washington also was
made aware of Its contents. While the
note was not addresed directly to Russia,
yet by the foregoing means it came fully
to the attention of the Russian authori
ties.
Administration Is Reassured.
As regards the eventual restoration of the
province to China It is manifest that fÂ»<=h In

Visional written conditions for a modus vivendl
were agreed upon first between the Russian
military authorities and the Chinese Governors
of â¢ three Mar.churian provinces.
"With reference to the institution of a local
Civil administration, subsequently, and after a
careful consideration of all the circumstances,
the Russian Government drew up the draft
of a special agreement with China providing
for the gradual evacuation of Manchuria, as
r.-ell as for the adoption of provisional meas
ures to assure peace in that territory to
prevent Â«the recurrence of events similar to
those of last year. Unfortunately, with the
object of stirring up public opinion- against
Russia, alarmist rumors were circulated in
the foreign press regarding the purpose and
intentions of the Russian Government. Falsi
fied texts of a treaty , establishing a protec
torate over Manchuria were quoted and erro
neous reports were designedly spread of an
alleged agreement between Russia and China.
As a matter of fact this agreement was to
serve as a basis for the restcratlon to China,
as contemplated by the Russian Government,
of the province of Manchuria, which, in con
sequence of the alarming events of last year,
was occupied by Russian troops. In order that
the requisite military measures might be
token it was imperative that the question
should be settled one way or the other. It
was impossible to lay down forthwith by
means of a mutual agreement, the conditions
of the- evacuation of Manchuria. According
to the news received serious hindrances were
P'oced In the. way of the conclusion of such
an agreement, and in consequence its accept- i
aiice by China, which was Indispensable for the
gradual evacuation of the province, proved
to be impossible.

ST. PETERSBURG, April 5.â The Offi

by the allied powers with the Chinese
plenipotentiaries at Tientsin and Peking
and of the negotiations that led to the
presentation of the French draft of peace
conditions which consisted of twelve
points, but which are not yet concluded.
The Russian Government then makes the
following statement: ;!-r *.'Â¦'..
"Japan, is. taJstng measures with a view
of hostilities with Russia," says the Pe
king correspondent of the Daily Express.
"She has 'entered- into an arrangement
with Liu Kin Yi, Viceroy of Nankin, who
is acting on behalf of the other friendly
viceroys and governors, regarding the
course they -will pursue in the way oi
aiding Japan against Russia. It is un
derstood that they have promised to
place the telegraph communications and
transport â¢ facilities at the service of
Japan."
A special from* St. Petersburg says:
Russia blames the powers for Chinas
refusal to accept the conditions of tne
evacuation of . Manchuria, and calmly
says she is In no hurry and can await
events.- The unbiased opinion here 19
that Russia occupies an impregnable di
plomatic position, from which nobody can
dislodge- her. However- warlike Japan
may feel, Russia is confident that no op
portunity will be given her to take the

wrong. As far as can be seen, Japanese
threats have not caused a ripple of ex
citement here.

NEW YORK, 1 April 5.-The Interstate
Commerce. Commission, composed of Jud
son C. Clements of Georgia, Charles A:
Prouty of Vermont, James D. Yeoman of
Iowa, ex-Governor . Joseph W. Fifer of
Illinois and. ex-Judge Martin A. Knapp of
New York (chairman), is in session in this
city to-day. The commission is sitting to
hear the protests of New York lumber
dealers who obtain their lumber from
West Virginia and Ohio and against what
they deem the discriminating freight rates
of the Norfolk and -Western Railroad.
These rates, it is claimed, are much in
excess of those ', charged by other lines
that have a less direct route from the
shipping points. Â¦,-â¢.
.Robert W. Higble,. a lumber dealer of
this city, told the commission that the
Norfolk and Western road charged from
6 to 7 cents more per thousand feet on
shipments of oak and poplar lumber than
did. the Chesapeake and Ohio, . the Balti
more and Ohio* and the Delaware, Lack

Dr. Johnson Ames advises as the safest
course to pursue on the first appearance
of grip symptoms to keep to the house for
a day or two and take Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets every hour ths first day and every
â¢ two hours the following day and states
that this will break up the trouble before
it becomes deep seated
These catarrh tablet* are antiseotic and
harmless and prevent fever and the fur-
Ither development of grip germs and ward
off the ever present danger of pneumonia.
Dr. Gerald Simpson says: "I have
found Stuart's Catarrh Tablets a pleasant
and thoroughly reliable remedy - for the
grip, especially with elderly people with
whom this prevailing:, disease . is always
cangerous; the tablets can be found at
any drug store and if uied freely durin?
the first few days cf the attack will break
La. " grippe is a catarrhal affection, the
germs are in the air ana no one is Droof
against it, but the timely use of Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets will prevent any serious
result*.. -'H^ttBBBBfl ' -----
â¢ However, there is no doubt but that the
grip Is catarrhal In character and the
leading symptom ln nearly every case is
increased secretion in the head and throat:
in fact, the first Indications of la grlppa
are those of a cold in the head which ex-
tends to the throat and lunsrs.
Everybody you meet on the streets now-
adays either has just Â«iad the grip, is com-
ing down with it or has a sure cure for it.
The disease has been a puzzle to physi-
cians ever 6ince its appearance several
years ago and it is as much of a puzzle
to-day as it was then. It exhibits such a
variety of symptoms in different individ-
uals and leaves such disastrous results
after apparent recovery that as yet Its
prevention and cure has baffled medical
science.

Senator Clark Fails to Obtain a Coveted
Eastern Terminal for His Railway.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 5.â The Union Pa
cific has apparently blocked the San Pe
dro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railway
in one quarter at least, and the new road
now being constructed by Senator W. A.
Clark, R. C. Kerens and their associates
from Los Angeles eastward will be com
pelled to build all the way into Salt Lake
City. Private dispatches received here
announce that the Union Pacific has closed
a deal for the Utah and Pacific Railway.
The Union Pacific has for some time had
an option on this property.
There had been an expectation in well
Informed quarters that at the right mo
ment Senator Clark's corporation would
obtain what it was seekingâ an eastern
terminus of its big enterprise by the ab
sorption of the Utah and Pacific. This
road 'extends from "Milford, Nev.. to
Uvada,' a distance of seventy-five miles,
where it connects with the Oregon Short
Line, which is the property of the Union
Pacific. "Â¦
J Ross Clark, vice president" of the Salt
Lake road, says that the news does not
surprise him, as he knew of the Union
Pacific option on the property, which for
that reason could not be obtained by the
San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake
Railway.
"The promoters of the Clark enterprise
were only waiting for tho option to ex
pire, when they would have made an of
fer for the eame property," said he. "The
new move will not interfere with our
plans in the slightest degree."

doned and bid in by the county. The
property .was not redeemed.
The decision of the Land Register to

in that vicinity are largely impregnated,
with oil, and the bay *Lt Kayak is fre

While the surface indications are good,

STOCKTON, April 3.â From what is
known liere of the vital points in the Su
preme Court decision invalidating the
bond issue in San Francisco, it is believed
that the recent issue voted by Stockton
will bo. void. The court held that the
election providing for the issue in San
Francisco should have been held under a
rity charter provision and not under the
.State law. A well-known attorney says:
"The same point is involved In the case
of the Stockton bonds. The bonds which
were issued about a year ago were voted
at an election held under the State law,
whrreas it should have been under the
provision of the Stockton city charter.
"In 1890 the State law eoverned. and it
was proj)er to issue the bonds under It
instead of under the charter. Since then
the State constitution has been amended
so that where there is a conflict between
duty charters and State law the charters
govern. That is the reason why Stock-
Ton's charter provision as to bonds should
have been followed instead of the State
lav.- in holding the last bond election."
City Attorney Thompson says that he
is uncertain as to the effects upon the
Stockton bonds, and that this will lead
him to set the matter before the feu
preme Court in some manner. The last
issue voted was about {100,000. Mr.
Thompson says:
"When our charter was adopted there
was a State law in effect governing bond
issues. Consequently the charter provi
sion was never legally adopted and is
therefore invalid. In the case of San
Francisco the facts were different. There
was no State law in existence at the time
the San Francisco charter was adopted.
J do not believe that the Supreme Court s
decision touches that point at all, but I
have not read it in full."

SAN BERNARDINO, April 5.â Solomon
Hancock, for years a leading horticultur
ist of San Bernardino County, died this
morning at the Southern California Hos

he was committed three years agro. He
was 43 years old and a great-grandson of
John Hancock, one of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence. His parents
live here.
The death of Solomon Hancock recalls
the tragic ending of his brother AJvin.
The latter's mind became unbalanced four
years ago, but he was kept at home in
stead of being sent to the asylum. One
day, while unwatched, he swallowed
poison and died an hour later. . Â¦

FOR OCEAN FISH
Entrance to the priest's residence was
effected through the rear door. In the
kitchen an ax was taken not to be used
in breaking open doors but evidently to
be utilized as a weapon in resisting at
tack. At the end of the hall was a larg-o
collection of canes, and from this a loaded;
cane was taken. This weapen and the ax
were found in the room where the burg
lary was committed.
The door leading to the room was pried
open with a Jimmy. The lock was broken
and the door somewhat battered. In two
closets Father McNamee had deposited
about $125, mostly in small silver coin. A
portion belonged to the parish and theÂ»
balance to the priest. Probably overcome
by a spirit of generosity the burglar left
one 5-cent piece. A box containing Jew
elry and trinkets was opened, but the ar
ticles nearly all bore the initials of Father
McNamee and were left in their place.

GENERAL BOOM
FOR COURSING
IN FIVE TOWNS
.Unparalleled Activity Dis-
Dlaued ' Iju Leashmen in
Many Parts of .the. State.
Notes From the Kennels
A glance at the programme of the vari
ous coursing parks of the State shows that
the sport has attained a proportion far
above' the.' expectations of the most
sanguine leashmen of a year or two' ago.
Not only In magnitude has the game im
proved, but the' class performers and
the quality of the hounds has improved in
all country associations.
On Sunday last no. less than five cities
offered coursing cards as a holiday attrac
tion and from reports received the attend
ance at each place was satisfactory.
Stockton; Los Angeles,' Vallejo,; San
Jose and -the local home of the "sport.
Union Park, ran stakes. In Los Angeles
a thirty-two-dog event and the finals of
an unfinished stake of the week before
made up the meeting. Storm King won
the first and the second was divided Â¦ by
Dick L and Happy Butte.
The improvement in quality of the coun
try meetings over those: of last year is
noticeable. . Very few of the runners are
of unknown stock or. of unpedigreed class.
The breeders in the outside counties have
given more attention in the past few years
to well-known .sires and the result .is
shown in the quality of the stakes. Â¦ Â¦
In the .. make-up of the events can be
found hounds . which > are fast enough in
any company and sufficiently clever; to
negotiate for honors in big events.
. The Kennel Club committee of arrange
ments, preparing for the- coming bench
show, Â¦ has chosen John .Bradshaw . to : of
ficiate as - judge â¢ over greyhounds. As
Bradshaw has been ruled off by; the
California coursing committee for his con
nection with I the doping ' of one* ; of I Joe
Watkins' â¢ hounds Â¦ at Ingleside sometime
ago, the question has â¢; been asked what
action will -be taken by the coursing club.
While it assumes no Jurisdiction over
bench shows, it will certainly not sanction
the entering of hounds because of the se
lection of Bradshaw.* If the Kennel Club
will choose some well-known coursing man>
in good standing to act as judge the com
mittee Â¦ states . that the ' contribution of
good dogs in Â¦ the greyhound class will be
more plentiful. Â» Â¦..--.- â¢ .

take the place of the mixed, entertain

Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill, A. W. Waters
and A. F. Broad, chairman, with ' power
to add two more to their number. The
San Francisco Yacht Club has on its roll
124 members, the largest number for many
years, and during the coming season will
make great efforts to raise its member
ship to 200. The assistance of Las Amigas,
a ladles' club, which is composed of the
wives; sisters," 'daughters and relatives of
the members, and which- uses the club
house on weekdays, has been enlisted in
aid of . the yacht club. Concerts and
dances will be given, for which the ladies
will decorate the big hall,. and the pro
ceeds will -be paid into a fund to be ex
pended solely for the purpose of complet
ing the assembly-room, by lining it, add
ing a large .fireplace and a permanent
stage, the latter to be built at the south
erly end of the hall, over the addition to
the clubhouse. In order to encourage men
who are not owners of a yacht to join the

Comment on Events of the
Past, Present and Fu
ture, on Which the
Public Has Its Eues
Without the blare of trumpets, a parade
through the streets or spectacular accom
paniment of any kind the California Base
ball League opened the season of 1901 on
March 31, simultaneously in this city and
Los Angeles. Depending on the success
of last season the league potentates haws
taken big bites out of two new loaves,
of which they feel confident i.ot only of
a complete mastication but also a per
fect digestion. Midweek games and tho
long Los Angeles jump are the new ven
tures. Even at this early date the stamp
of embryonic success has been . attached
to the operation of these plans and it now
devolves upon the league managers to
bui'.d upon the foundation.
The reports show an attendance of 1000
at the Los Angeles game on Thursday
and more than ha!f that number of spec
tators saw the game in this city on that
day. At Los Angeles the baseball game
was of the sensational orderâ twelve in
nings -with a 3-2 score. The game played
between Oakland and Los' Angeles on tho
opening day ended in a victory for the
visitors with the score reading 1-0. The
fans hereabouts read of these games with
belching eyes colored with all the green
and yellow of an envv that is noisx- anÂ«*
strident In Its expression. So far the
opening has been what is proverbiallv
termed auspicious. When the boycott is
removed the sailing will be clear and 021
a fair sea. Let the r-laving be of good
quality. Success, financial and otherwise,
will then attend the season for a surety.

Perhaps most popular recreational
sport engaging the attention and time of

Every day brings new converts to the
game and on all sides is heard the talÂ«Â£
of tournaments and match earnes. . The
game has grown to such proportions in
this city that it has displaced all othor
indoor, contests and modes of gvmnastio
exercises. The Olympic Club, the Occi

tbe three hotbeds of handball in this city

played that surpass any other indoor

* ..ment Between San Fran
cisco and Cakland Clubs
to Be Played at Presidio
At last a golf championship of the Pa
cific Coast has become a possibility. After
negotiations extending over a considerable
period a Northern California Golf Asso
ciation, similar to the already existing
Southern California Golf Association, has
been formed with the following officers:
P. E. Bowles, president; J. W. Byrne,
vice president; Andrew Carrigan, secretary
and treasurer; H. M. A. Miller. W. P.
Johnson, Warren Gregory and T. P.
Gower, .members of the executive com
mittee.
The golf associations of Northern and
Southern California have been united in
the Pacific Golf Association, which is to
include all the golf clubs of California,
Oregon. Washington and British Colum
bia, The officers of this are as follows:
"President, Hush Tevis; vice president,
John B. Miller; secretary and treasurer,
T. P. Gower; members of executive com
mittee â R. H. Hay-Chapman, Charles E.'
Maud. Charles K. Orr. F. S. Stratton and
four representatives of the Pacific North
west Golf Association. The association
will have two classes of membersâasso
ciate clubs, taking part in the manage-"
ment, and allied clubs, entitled to enter
tournaments, but not to a share in the
direction of affairs.
The new association will hold its first
championship tournament on the links of
the San Francisco Golf Club on April 24,
25, 26 and 27. It will be for men and it
is confidently expected that the most not
able golfers cf the Pacific Coast will take
part. Entries, accompanied by the en
trance fees, must be made with .Â». T. P.
Gower, secretary of the asscciation, not
later than 5 p. m. on Wednesday, April 17,
through the secretary of the club to which
the intending competitor belongs. Fur
ther details of this, the first Pacific Coast
golf championship competition, will be
given later.
The first half of the second home and
home match between teams of six men
representing the Oakland and San Fran
cisco Golf clubs will be played this after
noon on the Presidio links, beginning at
2 o'clock.
The San Francisco .representatives will
be chosen from the following: John Law
son, B. D. Adamson, J. W. Byrne, the
Rev. H. W. L. O'Rourke. L. O. Kellogg,
S. L. Abbott Jr., H. D. Pillsbury and H.
C. Golcher. The team will lack the ser
vices of H. B. Goodwin, who- during an
absence from the city contracted a bad
cold and has been kept to the house. John
Lawson will be piloting a big horse this
morning in the point to point hunt at Bur
lingame, and though riding a steeplechase
is not good preparation for a golf match
it is understood that he will be on hand
to play for the San Francisco Golf Club.
The Oakland team will be selected from
the following: W. P. Johnson, E. R.' Fol
ger, C. P. Hubbard, F. S. Stratton, R. M.
Fitzgerald, T. R. Hutchinson, P. E.
Bowles Jr.. Arthur Goodall and J. Ames,
The first interclub match of this season
was won 10 up by the San Francisco Golf
Club, and it is probable that the Presidio
men will r>ut a few holes to their credit
in this afternoon's play. . The Presidio
course is In fine condition, but the greens
are treacherously . fast and the strong
winds already prevalent are disconcerting
to visitors.
The second half of the home and home
tournament between the San Francisco
and Oakland Golf clubs will take place
next Saturday, April 13, on the Point Ad-
This morning at 10 o'clock, on the links
of the San Rafael Golf Club, there will be
a handicap) over, nine holes, match play,
against bogey for women. At 2 in the aft
ernoon the men will hold a handicap over
eighteen holes against bogey. The men's
best ball tournament recently- held at San
Rafael was won by J. J.- Crooks with a
"score of 87 less 3. 84 for eighteen holes,
R. Gilxnan Brown beins second with a
gross and net score of 95. This puts J. J.
Crooks among the scratch players of the
San Rafael Golf Club, together with E. J.

XEW YORK. April 5.â After a close and
escitlng- finish of the shoot off, miss and
out of the twenty-two ties in the Grand
American Handicap, Eugene C. Griffith of
Pascoag, R, I., won with a total of 43
straight kills at Interstate Park, L. I.
Twenty-two men tied for first honors with
25 kills each and In the shoot-off Griffith,
who was on the 28-yard mark, outpointed
all his opponents by killing- his eighteenth
bird. The victory of the New Englander
was a complete surprise to the majority
of the contestants as well as to the spec
tators. The winner holds the State cham
pionship of Rhode Island for shooting at
inanimate targets, but has not been promi
nent as a live-bird trap shooter. He said
to-day that he had not shot at more than
300 live birds in his career at the traps.
Last year he took part In the Grand
American Handicap contest and killed 22
out of 25, and this was his most successful
rffort at live birds until to-day. Griffith
received $600 in cash and the silver cup
presented by the Interstate Association.
Next to the winners the shooting done
by J. T. D. Morrison of St. Paul, who
stood a yard farther back than Griffith,
was the most meritorious. Morrison
killed 17 and went out on his eighteenth,
which was a very difficult bird. Morrison
received the second prize of $600 in cash,
n. R. Rahm of Pittsburgr. Pa., who was
handicapped at 27 yards, failed on the fif
teenth round of the shoot-off and re
ceived 5400 in cash as third prize. The
other nineteen shooters received sums
ranging from $225 to $72. according to the
position in which they finished.
To-morrow the Gllman-Burns Interna
tional trophy will be shot for, the condl
110ns of the event being 25 birds, $15 en
trance, handicaps from 23 to 33 yards, four
moneys, class shooting". There will also
be the Sportsmen's Association trophy
handicap under the same conditions, and
in case time permits there will be miss
and out events to suit the shooters.
Following is a, list of the shooters who
took part in the shoot-off for the Grand

fishing in tidewater. Patterson hooked
his steelheada in the well-known pool

relations arid says:
"We have little sympathy for the Vene

wholesale application of Monroeism that
is practiced in the United States./ It
menaces, the legitimate development of
European countries and we have reason

no less amusement than Interest."
NEW YORK. April 5.â At the French
consulate to-day it was denied that Comte
Robert de Pomeru, a . member of the
French Chamber of Deputies, would, un
der the law of that country, be considered
legally married simply because a woman
whom he had never seen or heard of be
fore said she had been wedded to him in
New York in 1892, and showed a certificate
bearing his name. ' -
"It Is absurd to think of such a thing,"
said an officer connected with the consu
late. "The fact is. this woman is the vic
tim of a rascal who assumed the Comte's
name and title*." â¢
The' Comte is a bachelor. Recently he
received a letter from a woman signing
herself Lizzie de Pomeru, who reproached
him bitterly for having deserted her after
marrying her in New York. The Comte
was in Rouen, France, on April 19, 1892,
the date- of Â¦ the marriage. He will have
the claim set aside by the Tribunal of the

C- â^ RUNSWICK, the clipper-figged
}) son of St. Carlo and Sloe, owned
CyV by Sam Hlldreth, defeated Rory
Â¦if Ough, Huaehuca and Jarretierre
d'Or in runaway fashion over
four and a half furlongs at Tanforan yes
terday in the remarkaoly fast time of
:53%, a world's record for two-year-olds
at the distance. The record for all-aged
horses at the route is only three-quarters
of a second lower, made by Meadows,
carrying 103 pounds, at Alexander Island,"
a three-quarter mile track, and the mark
has always been shrouded with doubt.
Brunswick, carrying 109 pounds, piloted by
Winnie O'Connor and a 1 to 2 favorite,
had as pacemaker Rory Ough, which beat
the other three starters away two lengths
or more. Not until the stretch was
reached did the favorite take command,
and then he won easily. The track had
been rolled. maKing it lightning fast, the
first sixteenth being reeled off in 6M sec
onds, faster, sa'.d Timer Dick Havey, than
he ever caught a horse before. The win
ner is a superbly turned gelding', possibly
not short enough coupled to suit many,
but possessed of an unlimited supply of
speed. Earlier in the week his present
owner purchased him from A. Josephs for
$3000. The youngster celebrated the
change of ownership by going out and
j beating Corrigan, and" Hildreth won him
out.
A little bit further on this splendid per
formance came very close, to being over
shadowed by the battle royal indulged in
between Waring and Kenilworth in the
six-furlong purse sprint, in which the
coast record oM:12V& was equaled. When
the entries came out Harry Stover saw
that his "bird" had dropped into a hard
spot, and tried to get tne brown colt ex
cused, but the judges failed to see it that
way. Besides this precocious pair, Head
water. Sly and Sad Sam were' present.
Waring, carrying 117 pounds, opened a 3
to 5 chance, but as-some doubt as to his
fitness existed eome even money could be
found at post call. Kenllworth, with 107
pounds and flounce in the saddle, had
second call; then came Headwater, once
as good as 7. Sly carried little or no sta
ble backing and receded to 10. Unfortu
nately, the start was not one of Dick
Dwyer'e happiest, ' Sly being left and
Headwater getting away badly. Kenil
worth outbroke Waring, but only for a
few yards. Thtn it simmered down to a
two-horse race, the pair chasing off by
themselves heads apart. Condition told
at the end, for despite O'Connor's frantic
effort astride the ttrst choice Kenilworth,
hard ridden throughout, caught the eye
of the judges first by the scantest of
heads. Ranseh on Headwater made up a
remarkable lot of lost ground, causing
his supporters to claim that had he been
off on eo.ual terms with the leaders he
would have won.
Outsiders disputed honors with the fa
vorites, getting away with three of the
purses. The excellence of the card at
tracted another large crowd.
Given the;glapsy eye even by her stable,
Barney Schreiber's Companion left the
maiden class in the. opening scramble, at
five furlongs. She was quoted at 12 to 1.
with Dominick in the saddle, and beating
the others away from the post won driv
ing from Chaste in 1:00^. Skip Me, ridden
by Mounce and backed from 8 to 5 to 4 to
5, was flat-footed when the. barrier went
up,.and, again bothered after getting un
der way, finished away back, i
âDon Luis,--a 6 to 1 slrot. with Ranseh on
his back, got the decision at the-finish of
the mile' and a furlong selling affair by
a nose from Lizzella. Rio Shannon cut
out all the running, and though very tired
at the paddock fought it out gamely, fin
ishing but a neck behind the leaders.
O'Connor waited altogether too long with
the favorite, Precursor, and later got in
terfered with while trying to get through
on the rail.
Long overdue,,Parmenion. finally got to
the surface, downing a big bunch of sec
ond-raters in the six-furlong selling event,
fifth to be decided. He ruled a slight fa
vorite over Foul Play and Brenhilda, and,
ridden with splendid judgment by O'Con
nor, reached home two lengths before, the
former. Alaska, a 10 to 1 shot, ran third.
Tristrain, a warm . "downtown" tip,
showed speed but blew up in the stretch, i
"Bill" Murry's chestnut cripple Crom
well ran circles around his field . in. the

"When I consulted you in April, 1899, I was
In poor health," writes Mr*. E. II. Newton, of
Vanburen. Aroostook Co.. Maine. ''Had been
sick all winter, and, to add to ray trouble, was
on the road to maternity, which the doctor said
Â¦would end my days. I was almost discouraged :
did not expect any help_, but thonjjht the end
was only a matter of time, andâ oh ! my two
poor, little, motherless children.
"It was in this condition that I began the use
of your vatuat-le medicine. On receipt of vonr
letter of Apri 6th my hnsband purchased six
bottles of 'Favorite Prescription' and 'Golden
Medical Discovery.' " and I used it as you
directed. When you wrote me words of en-
couragement on April 27th I had received no
benefit from the medicine, but determined a* a
last resort to give it a fair trial. I am now tak-
ing the thirteenth and last bottle. I have *
lovely baby girl three weeks old, that weigher!
jiH pounds at birth. My baby and I are enjoy-
ing: perfect health, thanks to your wonderful
medicine, to which I believe I owe my life."
Dr. Pierce's Pellets stimulate tie liver.
. Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription and
perseverance in its use will work won-
ders for the most hopeless' woman. If
Mrs. Nerrton, whose letter is given
below, had not persisted in its nse, sjie
might never have known the happiness
of perfect health. Perhaps the reason
for her persistence was because she used
"Favorite Prescription" as. a "last re-
sort." Physicians had failed. If " Favor-
ite Prescription" could not help there
was nothing to hope for. It did help. It
always helps and almost always cures.
It establishes regularityi dries weaken-
ing drains, heals inflammation and ulcer-
ation and cures female weakness. It
imparts strength ind elasticity to the
organs of maternity and makes the
baby's advent practically painless.

There in miniature is an illustration of what -will=
happen if the attempt be made to carve up China and
divide the pieces among the carvers. A world-wide
war would result. England and Russia have been
kept from each other's throats only because .one is
kept busy by the Botrs and the other has not >a
sufficient navy to defend the coast she has already
stolen from China. Otherwise Tommy Atkins and
Adam Zad would be pumping dumdums into each
ether, and the bear wjuld be chewing the lion's tail
while the lion chewed his paw.
Those who want honor to prevail in dealing with
China should hasten conclusions. America stands for
ecjuits' there. Let no urgency be omitted that. will
close negotiations. , . .f.
Some Americans have other views, and we are sorry
10 say that they are the missionaries. They are doing
all they, can to run our claim for indemnity to an
enormous amount. have put in preposterous
claims for the manuscript of their old sermons, lost
or destroyed in the Boxer outbreak. If they should
also claim damages for the spirit x)f Christianity lost
in the shuffle it would be more valid, for that spirit
cuts no figure in the attitude assumed by many of
them. .'. ,
It is daily becoming plainer, that civil government
must cut loose from responsibility for missionaries and.
their work. Civil government has no mission to evan
gelize other lands. Its duties are secular, and these
can be discharged everywhere with less friction than
:;ny missionary efforts can be carried on. SffM

MARRIAGE AND THE STATE.
McKinley has beeti the agent of prosperity for us
all. He has tried to so direct -the legislation of the
country as to encourage enterprise and provide work
nrii* wages for ail classes of labor; and it is gratify
ing to know that when he arrives here he will find
us all making the best of the opportunities his admin
iftration has given, and working together for the'gen
rral welfare.
The controversy out of which grew the menace of
a strike is not properly s subject of criticism by out
siders, since it concerned the business affairs of. the
company and the workmen; but their agreement
by which all danger of a strike is averted is a matter
upon which the public can- rightly express opinion,
siiÂ»ce it concerns the whole community. That opinion
is one of universal approval. All San Francisco wishes
to see the Ohio launched while the President is with
us. and, moreover, ail wish that he shall find at; the
Iron Works and indeed throughout the city full har r
incmy between labor ana capital.
Fortunately all such fears may now be set aside.
The labor leaders have shown a public-spirited inter
est in the visit of the President and have cordially co
r yerated with the company in seeking a basis of agree
ment upon all points At issue. Their efforts were not
tnede in vain, and, as was announced in The Call
resterday, concessions were made by the employers
which were satisfactory to the men, and the work of
ihe establishment is now going vigorously on.
A strike or any protracted discord at the Union
lion Works would under any circumstances be hurt
ful to the interests of the city; but at this juncture,
ivhen such an occurrence would prevent the comple
tion of the Ohio in time for her to be launched when
the President is in the city", it would be in the nature
cf.a public disaster. It would have interfered with
much of the pleasure the President expects of his trip,
and might even have led him to postpone it.
riiE flVERTED STRIKE.
BY wise action on the part of all concerned, the
strike threatened at the Union Iron Works has
been averted. Upon that fortunate ending of
:he controversy between the company and the em
ployes San Francisco js to be congratulated, and due
r.edit should be given to the men who arranged
:erms upon which the fortunate result has been at
tained.
Every exhibition that tends to bring these; facts
freshly arid clearly to the minds of- Calif ornians is in
the nature of a public benefit. ;' On any phase of ths
general subject, from .works of high art to the manu
facture of articles of. ever3 r day use, we are not likely
to have too much in the \yay of education for many
a year to come. The resources of the State in the
way of material for all sorts of art work are abundant,
and we have as yet made but little use of them.
Consequently a campaign'. of education,; or even an
episode of education in art work, is. always an excel
lent thing. Therefore in preparing the exhibit at the
1-Iechanics' Institute "the ladies of the California Club
have added another to the many good Works they have
undertaken for the State, and the enterprise merits a
liberal and widespread patronage. â¢ â¢'
The attention of [ the ' people^ in 'considering such
matters, should not be directed exclusively to what are
technically I khown : . as' 'Â» industrial arts." California
ought to do much in the way of producing bric-a-brac
and decorative art. -We have ample materials for the
fabrication of many sorts, of beautiful , things. We
have.sbme'of the finest wood in the world for art pur
pores, and manykinds of stone that could be worked
up in artistic forms. ' Moreover, our textile products
njiglit be made beautiful as well as useful. In short,
:;ve import from the East or from foreign nations
thousands of articles- of taste and luxury. that might
just as well have been' provided^by Californian arti-*
sans -and*, artists."*.. '. â¢ ' â¢ Â¦" -'-.. 'Â¦'Â¦Â¦ .
.- The' discoveries* of oil in such abundant quantities,
and 'the recent . developments in the. use of electrical
energy assure California in the future ample stores
of fuel and power for manufacturing purposes on the
largest scale. We'may now reasonably look forward
to. the . speedy coming of a time .when we will manu
facture within our borders most of the "raw material
we have been sending abroad. Thus a new stimulus
has been 'given to manufacturing enterprises, or
at least to public consideration of them, and the ex
hibition/ of the California Club comes at an oppor
tune time to show us what we have accomplished and
to intimate what more may be done...
\A ORE than ordinary interest attaches to the
/ \ work now being done by tHe ladies of the
California CIud. in arranging for a comprehen
sive exhibit, of the industrial' and allied arts of. Cali
fornia. This is to be the second notable exhibition
directed by the club, and from the success of the first
good auguries may be drawn of the. outcome of this.
The public may therefore expect" that when the expo
jition is. opened at Mechanics' Institute on Wednesday
evening there will be displayed an exhibition which
will afford-not only entertainment but .valuable in
struction for. all visitors. - : ; â¢-' .? '

The first Postmaster Â¦ General in Amer
ica was Benjamin. Franklin. He was "ap
pointed-by the English Government and
was allowed a compensation of Â£600 a
year for himself and his assistant, pro
vided "he. made that much." He served
nineteen years and was dismissed in 1774
because of nis devotion to the colonies
in their struggle aarainst English tyranny.
The first four, years that he served there
was a deficiency, and he did not receive
his full salary; but at the time he was
dismissed the postal service of the col
onies was yielding the crown a handsome
income. During the days of the confed
eration the mail service was in a chaotic
and disorganized condition. Â¦ The organi
zation of our present -system really dates
from the appointment of Samuel Osgood
of Massachusetts as Postmaster General
by President "Washington on September
2ff, 17S9. The Postmaster General was not
then -a' member of. the President's. Cab
inet. At that' time the . mail service
throughout the "country was wretchedly
inefficient. The mail was. transported
wholly upon horseback. In those. days the
carrier, usually an old man, jogged-leis
urely along. on a decrepit horse over un
kept roads, /with his letters deposited in
a pair >of .saddlebags, while he passed
away the time knitting from homespun
yarn his supply of winter socks;
. Early Growtii* of the Postal Service.
When Mr. Ossood was appointed Post
master. General there were seventy-five
pestofiices in. the United States and'.les3
than 2000 miles of post roads. . He- served
two years and enlarged the service three
fold, yet turned into the general treas
ury a net revenue of about 15 per -cent
of .the gross postal receipts. -.The -first
Postmaster General to, hold a seat in the
President's Cabinet was William T. Barry
of Kentucky. He -has the distinction- of
being not only the first Postmaster Gen
eial to sit as a Cabinet, officer but also
the first whose administration of the office
shows a deficit, the expenditures having
exceeded the receipts. He became Post
master General in â¢ 1829, served six years,
and during that time ran the department
over $500,000 in debt. This caused a great
scandal and resulted in the appointment
of Amos 'Kendall as his successor. Every
one of Barry's predecessors had adminis
tered the department so as to make it
yield a net revenue to the Government.
Nor was -.this, economy of administration,
at the i expense of '. an * efficient service.
From 1790 to 1829 the number, of offices
had increased from seventy-five to S004,
the aggregate length of pest routes from
1S75' miles to 115,000 miles and the 'gross
expenditures from $32,000 to $1,752,000 a
year.
Postmaster General , Kendall's Work.
At no time. in "the history of our coun
try has there been more rapid improve
ment of mail : facilities than during the
first thirty-nine years of the department's
existence. ; Long post routes were survey
ed and: laid out, over which mail coaches
'sped albnsr- at- the rate of 100 miles a day,
a prodigious speed before' the days . of
steam and electricity. Mr: Kendall > took
hold of the demoralized condition of the
department with such- energy that within
eighteen months' he not- only liquidated
the $500,000 ' indebtedness but had a large
surplus. Up to that time the postal ser
vice had been 'conducted ; as a business
institution. ,The Postmaster General man
aged .its financial affairs, paying the ex
penses from the receipts.
,In 1S36, upon Kendall's recommendation
a complete change was made and th?
present system of disbursements was es
tablished. All moneys now collected are
turned into the treasury and all expenses
are provided for : by . appropriations from
Congress. ; While;; according to. our. theory
of .government, this is the safest, financial
method and renders more difficult .the mis
appropriation ot public funds, yet the fact
remains. that since this system was estab
lished - there .'.have -bsen but three â¢ of - chS
thirty-one Postmasters General whose ad
ministrations .have shown a surplus. .', On
the i other -hand; -during' the, forty-seven
years under Â¦ the old -system ; every Post
master- General,, with .f the excectidn of
Barry.- made * the department . yield i a- net
revenue . to : the Government and < at the
same --time greatly imoroved the postal
facilities.- ;-. ,.

folio-wing . rates of postage, \ which pre

century: --For; every single letter -not ex

Franklin as Postmaster General.
Organizing . a Postal Service. "_ .'
The first effort' to organize a systematic
postal service was by. the General Assem
bly of Pennsylvania in- 1G93. A Postmas
ter was â¢ appointed for. the city of Phila
delphia. He . was authorized Â¦ to appoint
deputies, who were to serve as postmas
ters at other placed throughout that col
ony and to dispatch letters- to any place
in New England or the adjacent colonies.
He was also Â¦ required , to handle all let
ters relating to the public service free,
and all public ferries,- bridges, etc., were
subject to his use without delay or. charge.
His compensation was limited-: to Â£20 a
year. A fixed rate of postage 'was pre
scribed. In the preamble; of. this enact
ment the; General Assembly, declares it3
purpose to be "to the end that mutual
correspondence /may be maintained and
that letters may speedily and: safely be
dispatched from place to place."
In these enactments of our .forefathers
can be traced the principles upon which
our postal service has been organized. In
the Boston order the Postmaster was held
responsible for any damage that might
occur to the mails .in his possession, as
postal employes are to-day. '.:: In the Vir
ginia provisions the registry system is
recognized, and in the Pennsylvania en
actment we'notice many of the principles
of our present organization. From these
primitive beginnings has grown the Amer
ican postal service. ; . .
j That "which" to our ancestors a hundred
years ago would have seemed miraculous
or impossible is to us to-day ordinary and
commonplace. A : single, modern 'battle
ship, such S as the Oregon or -Kentucky
could have defeated . in the open . sea the
combined fleets of the world in the days
of Nelson. A. single' company of United
States "soldiers, "equipped /with' modern
arms, " could haveV defeated Lord - Howe at
Brandy wine.;; But -in no branch of govern
ment has* there 'been greater' progress
than in postal affairs. _ It is said : that ' the
postoftice has been . the . forerunner of . in
tellectual 5 development. I would not put
it that way. It is. more the outgrowth of
such development. , Our . postal service
was originated in . compliance with a pub
lic - demand. â¢ - It became " a necessity . be>
cause of the intellectual activity of the
times.-. It was not '-constructed by' any
great organizing 'genius.â' It grew -as the
tree, nurtured by. the sunshine of popular
Intelligence. -â¢'. - ; â¢ - :; Â¦Â¦--- Â¦.;- Â¦:Â¦ " â¢:'â¢-â¢â¢ 'V , . .--. : .-T".
The first" postoffice established in Amer
ica was at Boston, -Mass., in 1Â«39. By.an
order -of the: general court of the colony
the house â ot . Richard- Fairbanks was
designated as the place where all letters
which were ""brought', from" beyond: -the
seas^or are to! be sent thither" should be
left. Fairbanks was charged with the re
sponsibility of delivering the letters as
directed,- and -was permitted to collect a
fee of'l penny for every letter handled. |
' The next postal regulation in the colo
nies was an enactment of. the -Virginia
Assembly in March, ; 1657, which provided
that whenever a letter relating to public
business was -delivered at any plantation
in the; colony the proprietor of said plan
tation should .immediately forward It to
the I next plantation, Â¦ and so oh until it
reached its destination, ' Any one falling
to comply promptly, with this requirement
was fined one hogshead of tobacco. Later,
by an amendatory- act,- it was' provided
that if there was, any -one upon-the-plan
tation who could .write he should indorse
upon the letter- the 'time it was received
and dispatched, the. purpose being to en
able the officers more easily to fix the re
sponsibility for delay. 7. ..Â¦

cents; 350, to 450 miles, 22 cents: over.450
miles, 25 cents. This Is quite an interesting
schedule. By "single letter", is meant a
single sheet of paper." If in writing a let
ter two sheets were used double rate.3
were" charged; for .three - sheets, triplo
rates. If a letter contained more than
three sheets it became a packet and for
every packet weighing one ounce four
times the rates paid for a single letter was
charged. So that when General Washing
ton, at his. home at Mount Vernon, wrote
to Hancock or Adams at Boston, if his let
ter contained four sheets the postage was
$1 in coin. Two- cents will now carry n
letter of the same size from Ponce, Porto
Rico, to Manila, Philippine Islands, a dis
tance of. about 13,000 miles. In 1S45 the
rates were radically reduced and postage
was charged according to the weight of
the letter instead of the number of sheeta.
Newspapers and magazines were not ad
mitted to the mails until 1792. 1 A charge of
1 cent Â¦ for every paper for a distance less
than 100 miles and 1% cents for more than
100 miles was made: for magazines tÂ«<2
same was charged per sheet. Prior to that
time newspaper publishers made. private
contracts with mall carriers to carry their
newspapers from town to town. After. that
date, the post = carriers were forbidden to
make such contracts. This caused a great
disturbance among the publishers and the
action of Congress was criticized with great
Â¦ severity. The .postage charged - on ; news
papers was declared .to be a tax upon
knowledge. At these rates it would cost
$; 95 to.send the January number of Mun
sey's Magazine from New York to Chica
go. Now it costs less than a cent. - i'<Â£; '-'
' , Tlis Indispensable Postage Stamp.
The postage stamp "io a modern device,
though possibly :of. ancient origin.. Pro
fessor Mommsen says "that, at one period
in the history . of che. Roman -empire
stamps somewhat similar. to the modern
postage stamp , wereâ used. But the first
authentic record "of the use of. the postage
stamp was in Germanv, by Count Franz
of Thurn and Taxis, who in 1516 originat
ed the" first :"Â¦ commercial -postal service
known to history. England was the first
to recognize the utiluy of the adhesive
postage stamp and in 1840 adopted it a3
a feature of its postal service. Seven
years later our Government followed Eng
land's . example.
The adhesive stamp probably has con
tributed more to the improvement of mod
ern mail facilities than all other causes
combined. Without the adhesive stamp it
would be utterly impossible to transact
the postal business of this country. Prior
to 1Â£:47 a postmaster was required to in
dorse in writing on the face of every let
ter mailed the date, place deposited and
the amount of postage required or paid.'
To make such an indorsement upon all
letters that are now daily dropped into
the United States mails would be wholly
impracticable. Â¦ Without the adhesive
stamp our present cheap postage would be
an impossibility. ' - â¢ ' â¢
Before the stamp :- was adopted post
masters in the large cities kept book ac
counts with all the leading business men
or firms that patronized their respective
offices. When letters from these firms
were brought to the office the postmaster
; would compute the postage on each let
ter, charge it and collect his bills month
ly. " How many bookkeepers and col
lectors would the postmaster at New
York or Chicago have to employ now if he
transacted business in that way? In.~lS45
the postmasters- at Baltimore, New
Haven, New York and St.'Louis had post
age stamps printed upon their own au
thority and adopted them as a labor-sav
ing device in lieu of keeping these ac
counts. Postal experts take great pride
in the marvelous achievements of the
modern mail . service, but none of these
would have been possible without the ad
hesive stamp. , The invention of the tele
graph and the locomotive is ' credited in
the popular mind with having chiefly
contributed to modern progress, . yet it is
a question whether J Slr Rowland. Hill,
who. by his persistent devotion to postal
reform, gave to the world the adhesive
postage stamp, should not be placed in the
list of the world's great benefactors be
side Morse and Watt. '."...
Later Postal Improvements.
Most of the great divisions of the Amer
ican postal service are -of recent origin.
The registry system was adopted- in the
United States in 1855. The first year after
Its inauguration there were 629,332 pieces
of mail registered; in 1900 there were 18 -
422,649. The money order system was not
adopted until ISM. During the first year
of its operation 74.277 money orders were
issued, aggregating $1,360,122. In 1900,
33,163,050 money orders were is
eued, aggregating $i55,670,027. The free
delivery system was first established in
cities of over, 50,000 inhabitants in 1863
The first year of its operations 6S5 car
riers were employed and $204,477- ex
pended for its maintenance; in 1S00 15 322
carriers were employed, and the total ex
pense fer free delivery was $14,671,362
In the- early period of our postal service
the sanctity of the mails was not so jeal
ously guarded as it is to-day. Postcarriers
and postmasters frequently opened letters
which they thought of interest and made
themselves an.l the public familiar with
their contents. So prevalent was this prac
tice that Jefferson, Washington and many
other public men carried en all important
correspondence, in' cipher to insure its
secrecy. Although the penalty flared for
robbing the malls was death, thrsdid not
secure them against depredations. It is
estimated that 3.309,755,000 letters were
transmitted- thiough the:mails last vear
Of this number there were about 10 C-00
losses reported, or one loss for every 331 -
000 letters transmitted. .
Knormous Growth of the-Ssrviec.
In 1790, when Mr; Osgood organized ' the
system, there were seventy-five post
offices. On January 1, 1901. there were
76.594. The gross receipts of the postal ser
vice in 1790 were $37,935; in 1900 they wefe
$102,354,579. The grross expenditures in 1790
were $32,140; in 1900 they were $107,249 298
In 1790 there were 1875 miles of postroads'
in 1900 there vere 500,990 miles.
To-day the American citizen can attach
a 2-cent stamp to a letter weighing one
ounce or less directed to any part of our
vast possessions, v/hich now reach more
than half way around the globe, and if
properly addressed the chances are 331 000
to one that it will be safely delivered
and if loss should occur the United States
Government will oipend hundreds of-dol
lars in endeavoring to fix the responsibil
ity for such loss. Should it appear that
the loss was occasioned by the negligence
or criminality, of an employe, he is not
only required to make good the damage
to the sender, but to answer before the
courts of his* country for the violation of
its postal laws.
S;A Benefit to ' All the People.
â¢The postal service touches every ele
ment of societv. There is no rural com
munity t too obscure for the postoffice to
reacts. A representative of this depart
ment daily knocks at the door of every
citizen- of our great cities. Upon the most

PIMPLESâ L,. L., Suisun, . Cal. "Are

HOMESTEADâ Subscriber, Hemet. Cal.
The answer that was given a few days
since in relation to a husband not en

State set aside, as a homestead. If a

The San- Francisco Labor Council re
fused at its meeting last night to indorse
the boycott , of the California Baseball
L*eague instituted by the Building Trades
Council. After a long discussion the vote
against indorsement was over whelming,
fifty-nine members voting, in the negative
as against fifteen in the affirmative.
This body-blow to the boycott was de
livered after P. H. McCarthy and other
leaders In the Building Trades - Council
had addressed the meeting.
Â¦ The signal defeat of the motion for in
dorsement was in effect a vote of lack of
confidence in the Building Trades Coun
cil. The feeling was strong that the sister
organization had made a mistake and In
dorsement of it/would only augment the
evilA - Â¦ / . .
Tho question was taken up during the
consideration of the report of the execu
tive committee, transmitting the request
of the Building Trades Council that its
baseball boycott be indorsed. A commit
tee from the Building Trades Council was
waiting to present its side of the case.
At 10 o'clock a motion to admit the com
mittee was made and carried. .
H. L. "White/secretary of the Typo
graphical Union, moved that Theodore F.
Bonnet be asked to present the other side
of the subject. He said Bonnet had been
a good friend to labor and was himself a
regular member of the Typographical
Union, not an outsider. There were some
objections, but White's motion prevailed/
Before the .committee came in there
were some very pointed remarks made.
M. Casey of the Brotherhod of Teamsters
said that he objected to the whole pro
ceeding.
"I did not come into the Labor Council,"
Casey said. Vto be attached to the tall of
a political yellow dog."
The reference was to P. H. McCarthy.
The committee from the Building
Trades Council sent in a request that it
be heard in. executive session, but the
motion to grant the request was promptly
.defeated by a vote of 37 to 50. The com
mittee did not want the reporters in the
hall while its case was being presented,
and the members debated for a time
whether or not to go before the Couricil
at all, but they finally decided to oiake
the best of the open session.
P. H. McCarthy was the first speaker.
He reviewed the history of the mill
men's lockout, and the attitude of E. &
L. Emanuel during that time and since.
He told of the protest made by Business
Agent Saunders to Henry Harris when it
was learned that Emanuel was to do the
repairing on his cagar store. Harris had
told Saunders that, he had already let
the contract and . would not recall it.
This attitude forced the Council to de
clare a boycott.
E. J. Brandon, vice president of the
Building Trades Council, argued that if
the innocent members of the baseball
league did not want to suffer they could
get rid of Harris and escape the boycott.
William Cole, of the Carpenters' Union,
made a plea for harmony between the
two central labor bodies. The twenty
minutes allowed the committee having
expired, th* committee retired amid gen
erous cheers.
T. F. Bonnet was then escorted into the
hall to make his statement. ' . . ' ...
"I do not come before you." Bonnet said,
"to ask you to violate any of the prin
ciples of unionism, but only that you do
no violence to them. One of these prin
ciples is that a boycott must be levied for
some just, reasonable purpose."
Continuing Bonnet su.NI the Recreation
Park corporation had always recognized
unionism. If Harris was guilty let Â»hlm
be punished. He said he and his asso
ciates would gladly do anything in their
power to right whatever wrong had been
committed, if any way to do so could be
pointed out to them, j They could not ex
clude Harris, as he owned stock in the
corporation and there was no way to com
pel him to sell his stock.
The Labor Council went Into executive
session and discussed the question for
nearly an hour. During the discussion
Secretary Rosenberg charged that P. H.
McCarthy was trying 1 to divide organized
labor of the city in order to strengthen
his own organization, which, Rosenberg
asserted, had but 4(k i 0 members, instead
of 12,000 as claimed.
As a result of the defeat of the motion
to indorse the boycott members of unions,
other than those of the building trades,
will not be required to stay away from
the ball games.

to Reach Better Understanding
for Benefit of a Growing

The oil producers of the Kern River

city soon to make some arrangements for
improving: conditions that are not satis
factory. The price of oil is down, the
various producers are competing with one
another in a way that menaces the wel
fare of all and there is an entire absence
of unity of action, notwithstanding a gen
eral community of interests. These cir
cumstances have led Henry Ach,. presi
dent of the Monte Cristo Oil Company, to
Invite many large producers to send rep
resentatives to a conference ,'to be held
at the Palace Hotel on or about April 12.
Great interest will attend on the meeting
because of the very important results that
may follow. *.
. '.'I called the meeting," said Henry Ach
yesterday, "at the request of oil pro
ducers in the Kern and McKittrick dis
tricts. It will be- an executive session,
but the results "will be made known at
its close. ' The object is to promote the
general welfare of the oil industry of this
State. What will be ' done no one can
know in advance. There is no pro
gramme, but the idea is that' there
will be a general discussion of the situa
tion for mutual advantage. We hope to
receive ideas and suggestions from all
producers who desire to offer them.
"We desire to put up the price of oil
to a reasonable figure and to hold it up
there. How to do fhis will be discussed.
All things that concern us'as producers
will be gone over. Such, action will be
taken as ks judged to be advisable for the
interests of the industry." *

HANCOCK ATTEMPTS TO
. EFFECT RECONCILIATION
Avers His "Wife Refused to Listen- to
His Offer to Return to
Her.
In an affidavit filed yesterday Robert J.
Hancock avers that the effort of his wife,
Ella Wood Hancock, to secure an injunc
tion to restrain him from visiting her
home, S2S Broderick street, is the work of
spite following an attempt upon his part
to effect a reconciliation.
Hancock admits that he called" at his
wife's home in company with Dr. C. K.
Hart, a mutual friend, but says his visit
was for the purpose stated. He denies
that he insulted his wife's mother or that
he ordered the servants around. ' In an
accompanying affidavit Dr. Hart cor
roborates all the facts stated.
Hancock further avers that he has
never refused to maintain and support hi8
wife, but says that he did object to her
receiving $400 a month, as his income only
amounts to f562 monthly. He says he of
fered her $150. a month, but this she re
fused and instituted, an action for main
tenance. ;â i'
As to the amount of Hancock's income
his allegation is supported in an. affidavit
by George S. Tilden. who collects the
rents of the defendant's properties.

fellow and am anxious to know if my be
loved son is alive and well. His last letter
must have been written while he was at
the Catholic Seamen's Free Reading-room.

WASHINGTON, April 5.â Secretary
Root has been considering the subject of
artillery regulations for" the corps. The
reorganization act provided that the Sec
retary should prescribe regulations, and
under this clause he has sought informa
tion from the army officers qualified to
make suggestions. He has requested the
views of colonels of artillery and most
of these have been received and are now
being considered.
When the regulations are formulated
and adopted a chief of artillery will be
named ar.d tv.-o additional officers selected
for members of the ordnance and forti
fication board. Several colonels of artil
lery have Indicated their disinclination to
serve as chief of artillery, as the selec
tion carries with it no additional rank or
pay and everv colonel Is now In com
mand of some post, a more pleasant duty
than can be found as chief of artillery
stationed in Washington and directly sub
ordinate to the officers in the department
with the whole responsibility of the corps

DENVER: April 5.â Merrill R. Mitchell,
a civil engineer, who for the last two
years has . been superintending the con
struction of the Mexican Central Railroad
from Guadalajara to the Pacific Coast,
was in Denver to-day on his way East.
He said:
"As in all new countries labor Is scarce
and we have had much difficulty in build
ing the grades. The work .is let out to
contractors and they in turn contract with
agents for any class of laborers that can
be furnished. For the last six months
these labor contractors imported Chinese
coolies, who were kept in a condition of
actual slavery.
"The _coolies^are imported from China
and their transportation is paid by tht.
contractors, who hold over their headÂ»
the debt thus contracted. They are housed
in camps which have absolutely no sani
tary arrangements and are worked like
slaves. Besides this they are insufficiently
fed and made to do .he hardest kind of
work, at which they are kept from four
teen to sixteen- hours. When the time of
their contract has expired they are rarely
re-engaged, as the contractors prefer to
Import a fresh lot, over whom they can
hold the debt for their transportation.
"When one of the coclies becomes un
ruly he is tied to a stake and beaten aitd
otherwise maltreated. Some of the
stronger and more courageous run away,
but those who are captured are made ex
amples of by their employers. Many of
them die and no attention at all Is paid
to those who break down under the ter
rible strain imposed upon them."

OMAHA, April 5.â Two Police Judges,
each claiming legal possession of the Po

formed policemen, was the spectacle here
this morning.
The two were- Samuel I. Gordon, the

claims was wholly illegal, and Brycn
Crawford, Justice of the Peace, who was
named bv the Mayor and confirmed by
the Oouncil last night as Gordon's suc
cessor during his suspension from office.
Crawford arrived Irst vnis morning. He
at once took possession of the bench,
Â¦while B force of six uniformed patrolmen
under Sergeant Bebout surrounded the
desk. Then the morning prisoners wer-2
brought into the courtroom. Crawford
sentenced several.
Later Judge Gordon arrived on the scene,
accompanied by his son. With perfect de
liberation and coolness Gordon removed
his hat and overcoat and, noticing thai

NEW YORK, April 6.â Reports that
huge railroad combinations are in process
of formation were widely circulated here
to-day. Detailed statements concerning
the plan alrcaly published looking to the
combination of all the great railway sys
tems of the United States under the con
trol of one company were given, but as a
general thing prominent railroad officials
and bankers declined to discuss the mat
ter.
According to all accounts the enterprise
involved the greatest cobmbination of
capital known in the history of finance.
It was said the company would be formed
under the laws of New Jersey for the pur
pose of conducting a general freight and
transportation business throughout the
United States; that the company would
hold a controlling interest in all the great
railway systems, and that the manage
ment of the roads would be vested in the
controlling company. "
According to the proposition each road
would preserve its identity and corporate
existence, but the new company would
control the affairs of all. J?y this policy,
it was asserted, large euips* of money
could be saved as a result of economics
in management and the stopping of rate
cutting. The names of men like J. Pier
pont Morgan. William â¢ K. Vanderbilt,
James J. Hill, Edward B. Harriman,
George J. Gould. John D. Rockefeller. Ja
cob H. Schiff and James Stillman were
freely used.
One report stated that the first step in
the proposed plan would be the securing
of control of the stocks of the Chicago,
Burlington and Quincy, the Erie, the
Great Northern and the Northern Pacific,
and that provision would be made tor the
acquisition of other properties in the im
mediate future. DJscussing the reported
AMERICAN RAILROADS

Reports Gain Circulation That the

amalgamation of the railroad interests of
the country, the New York Press will say
to-morrow: â¢
"All that is aimed at. according to the
best authority obtainable, is a 'commu
nity of interests.'- The close amalgama
tion on a 'community of interests' basis
was first brought about through the ef
forts of J. Plerpont Morgan. As a result
of this close union of interest ruinous
rate wars are already at an end, not so
many high-priced officials are needed as
before and one can buy a ticket on any
trunk line in almost any one of the large
offices in the city. However, not a single
company will be formed under the New
Jersey laws to take over all the railroads
of the country Is not considered seriously
by well informed railway men."
Dispatches received in this city to-night
from Cincinnati stated that a gigantic
amalgamation of four railways under the
guiding hand of J. Pierpont Morgan had
already taken place. The roads men
tioned were the Southern Railway, the
Cincinnati. Hamilton and Dayton, the
Chicago. Indianapolis and Louisville and
the Cincinnati Southern. ! Relative to this
particular report, Samuel Thomas, presi
dent of the Chicago, Indianapolis and
Louisville Railroad, to-night said:
"At the present time there is little to say
about the deal. I believe the report that
comes from Cincinnati, however, is a lit
tle bit premature. I do not believe the
amalgamation has been effected yet. It Is
true that steps are under .consideration
looking toward a combination of the
roads mentioned. I think it will be ef
fected, for all of the interests are favor
able to it. It can scarcely be called an
amalgamation of the roads under the
scheme that is under consideration. It is
merely a centralization of power looking
toward the best interests of the various
road.s."

DIES IGNORANT
OF HIS RICHES
Insane Man Who Owned a
Silver Mine Passes '
Away in Kansas. â¢
Â¦ Â» :
- Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, April 5.â A millionaire who
never knew of his fortune, although he
was 36 years' eld, died yesterday after
noon 1n an insane asylum in Wichita,
Kans., where he had spent the last twen
ty years. He was William Wood, owner
of the Little Emma mine, at Aspen, Colo.,
one of the richest silver mines ever dis
covered. '
The Emma mine, which is the sole prop
erty of the estate, reverts to William
Wood's mother, Mrs. Margaret Billings,
who is now living in Canada. Judge P.
L. Hubbard, who Jias protected Wood's
interests ever since he was appointed con
servator of the estate, in 1S93, will be se
lected as administrator. Comparatively,
little will go to Mrs. Billings on account
of the vast expense to which the estate
has been put in defending suits. attacking
its title to the mine.
The death of Wood closes a remarkable
story, which has been rehearsed over and
over again in the courts for the last sev
enteen years. . Thp Little Emma, was
staked by W. J. Wood, father of the in
sane man. Litigation over the property
commenced in 1884. Jerome Wheeler, who
fought to get control of the mine, found
Mrs. Wood and her family, who were in
poverty, and received deeds to the mine
for small sums, representing that it was
valueless, although at that time it was
producing more silver than any other
mine in the world.
J. H. Casserleigh of Leadvllle hunted up
the Wood heirs, informed them of Wheel
er's deception, and they began thefr fight
for the mine in 1S90. Nine years before
that, however, William Wood had been
made insane by a blow on the head. He
was then 16 years old. He was struck in
a saloon brawl in Wichita, Kans. Ulti
mately he became sole owner of the prop
erty. At the time of his death he was
about to be taken to Europe and placed
under the treatment of specialists in the
hope of restoring his reason.

THE famous portrait of Georglanna,
fifth Duchess of Devonshire, stol
en in 1876 from a London art gal
lery by American thieves, has been
recovered through the instrumen
tality of the Pinkerton Detective Agency.
The theft of the picture, its subsequent
history and the remarkable persistency of
William A. Pinkerton in trying to trace
it for twenty-five years makes a tale that
would discount most fiction and make a
living Sherlock Holmes jelalous.
A peculiar feature of the crime lies in
the fact that the almost priceless canvas
was not purloined with any intention on
the part of the thieves of. accepting the
large reward offered for it "or with any
idea of selling it once it was in their pos
session. Instead it was to be used by the
conspirators as a means of compelling its
owners to provide ' ball for a notorious
crook who had been arrested in France
on a charge of forging drafts for a large
amount against English banking houses.
The Messrs. Agnew, art dealers of 39
Bond street. Ixmdon. paid in 1875 the then
fabulous price of 10,500- guineas for the
painting and placed It on exhibition in
their establishment.
The portrait had been recognized for al
most e 'century as the masterpiece of
Gainsborough, the greatest of English
painters. During a severe storm on the
night of May 15, 1876, thieves entered the
Agnew establishment and cut the picture
from its frame, afterward making good
their -escape. The theft of the renowned
portrait created a great sensation at the
time, but r.o trace of it was -found until
several years later, when Joe Elliott, alias
"Little Joe," a New York forger of in
ternational reputation, sent for William

ALLEGED BUNKO MAN
REGAINS HIS LIBERTY
Difficulty of Sustaining a Conviction
Again Exemplified in Ma
honey's Case.
The difficulty of convicting an alleged
bunko steerer was exemplified again yes
terday when Judges Cook and Lawlor,
sitting in bank, heard the appeal in the
rase of Charles Mahonw. who was con
victed of vagrancy in June last and sen
tenced to six months in the County Ja'l
by Judge Conlan.
Judge Graham represented Mahoney at
the trial, but yesterday Attorney Mowry
appeared for him. He contended that ther"Â»
was nothing in the evidence to prove thai
the defendant was a vagrant and the
Judges agreed with h'm and sustained
Â¦the appeal.
Mahoney has been arrested several
times since his conviction, but was sim
p'y shown to the watches and released.
operations.
A partial confession by Dan Sullivan,
discoveries by experts of Irregularities in
Peery's methods of handling funds and
peculiar entries in the books of J." J.
Groom, clerk of Judge Fritz's Police
Court, were the | features of the day at
the Hall of Justice. While Sullivan's con
fession Is not as full as the police and
members of the Grand Jury like it to be,
it shows he had prepared for wholesale
Thursday afternoon Sullivan signified to
Captain Seymour his desire to go over the
books of the different courts and to point
out the names of the parties upon whose
alleged orders he had obtained money.
When he awoke in the morning he was
hot feeling well and asked to be excused
from undergoing the ordeal. Captain Sey
mour was Insistent and had the books
sent up to the prison in charge of De
lective Coleman.
After a desultory examination of over
an hour he handed in the following list of
admitted bail withdrawal orders, claim
ing- it covered all .his delinquencies bn
those orders to which he had forged the
Judges' names:
Department 1. Judge Moranâ
J. C. Wilson. November 18 $100
Jennie Foster. March 25 60
Ciertie Raymond, March lti 60
Total .$200
Department 2, Judge Conlanâ
Ching Suey, A. D. W $250
Ella Thomas, D. T. P 260
Marshall 200
Brooks 200
Kenny 100
Alburn 100
Total J1100
Department 3, Judge Fritz-
Frank Nugent, March 25 $100
B. C. Park, March 22 100
Total 1200
Or full total of $1500. . .â¢
Sullivan said he was unable to say what
portion of these orders bore genuine sig
natures of Judges and which forged unless
ho saw them. He said he was sure this
covered all, but he would go over the
books later if he felt better. There was
no change for the better during the after
noon, and the work will be taken up at a
later date.
Together with the orders that Sullivan
is blown to have previously cashed,
with those he admits, his total
runs up to $2000. But as there is a dupli
cation in the matter of Ella Thomas and
thÂ« four bunko men, Mar"shall, Brooks
Kenny and Alburn, whose money was
withdrawn in two orders under the name
of A. Mack, the total will be $2000 approxi
mately.
Sullivan's Indisposition.
. Sullivan's- indisposition is the result of
a cold and the sudden breaking off from
liquor. He is not in a serious condition,
though not as loquacious as heretofore.
Before many days it is expected he will
tell what he did with the money and who
shared it with him.
Sullivan's case is on the calendar of
Judge Cabaniss' court for this morning,
but it may be postponed.
Peery distinguished himself by turning
over $250 which he had kept in his safe
since last October, when it should have
been transmitted to tne Treasurer through
the County Clerk at that time. Charles
Mahoney was arrested for vagrancy on
July 2 of last year and later was convict
ed. He was defended by Judge Graham.
He took an appeal to the Superior Court
soon after and $250 cash bail was put up.
This, according to Peery's statement, was
placed in an envelope and left in his safe.
When Mahoney's case was dismissed yes
terday Peerv made haste to hand him
back "his money. In all these cases the re
quirement of the law is that the bonds or
the bail money must be transmitted with
the notice of appeal to the County Clerk.
The County Clerk retains possession of
the bonds and places the money in the
city treasury.
Cne explanation made by Peery is that
his clerks did not know what to do with
this money, as it was the first appeal case
that came under their notice. So after
many lengthy consultations it waa de
cided to keep it in the safe and treat it as
a special deposit. It reposed there undis
turbed until the scandal broke out, when,
Peery says, he did not like to turn it in to
the treasury on account of the fuss that
would be made.
Groom to Be Superseded.
WARRANTS MUST BE
AUDITED HEREAFTER
Clerk J. J. Groom was still at the desk
in Judge Fritz's court yesterday, al
though Chief Deputy Goddard was pres
ent to watch proceedings. Groom will be
superseded by Ambrose Watson on Mon
day. The change would have been made
yesterday, but as it was law and motion
day in the Superior Court Watson had to
remain at his desk in Judge Hunt's court.
The irregularities in Groom's books con
sist mainly in failures to properly note
the deductions of fines from bails and
othor discrepancies, which the ' expert is
endeavoring to solve. It is not known to
what extent Groom has erred in this mat
ter, but the Grand Jury will insist on a
full explanation of every transaction. All
tho books of the clerks are being experted
in the record room of the Police Depart
ment.
Cyril Williams, the expert, assisted by
Sergeant Charles McDonald, are working
together. It was discovered yesterday
that in the Kemppe case no entry was
made in the courtroom clerk's books, al
though the money, $500, was deposited
â¢witlr the Treasurer and drawn out on a
forged order by Sullivan.
All moneys in the hands of Peery up to
S o'clock yesterday were deposited with
the City Treasurer.
Xo demands for the payment out of ball
money were signed by any of the Police
Judges, nor were any discoveries of ad
ditional forgeries made. A nice legal
question as to which of the parties to
these crooked transactions is responsible
for the money that has been paid out will
be at issue in a few days.
Colonel S. H. Brooks, City Treasurer
decided yesterday that he would not paj
any more orders' for bail money unless
the orders had been passed by the Citj
and County Auditor. In' speaking of the
scandals and forgeries in connection with
bail money in the Police Courts Colonel
Brooks said:
â¢ "I do not propose to take any mon
chances in cashing the orders of the Po
lice Judges for bail money. I have giver
orders to my deputies that after this datt
all orders must be passed by the City and
County Auditor. It bail money orders. art
presented at this office we shall refuse tc
"pay them unless the Auditor has passed
them. This taik about persons being put
to trouble to come. here and cash orders
is all stuff and nonsense. Any one having
a check on a bank has to go to the trou
ble to be identified in order to get the
check cashed, and for my own protection
and also for that of my deputies I pro
pose to take the precautions. . . '
"I think that a proper step in connection
with the payment of bail money would be
to require that a lithographed receipt
should be given when bail money is ac
cepted. This receipt should bear a num
ber, which number would be entered on
the books of this ofllce when the money
is received. t
"When a person desired to draw out' bail
money the order of the- Judge should be
issued, and my office would only pay the
money on presentation of the original re
ceipt, together with the order of the Judge
exonerating ' the bail. We would return
the original receipt to the bond and war
rant clerk and keep the order of- the
Judge. This method would be most effect
ive to prevent fraud df any kind." - , â¢
* Bond and Warrant Clerk Peery, when
told of the decision of the City Treasurer,
"Well, I suppose I will have to make out
duplicate papers for the City and County
Auditor, giving an -. - account of all bail
money I receive and pay. into theVdty
treasury. It will be hard on me to do It;
but' under the circumstances 'I shall have
no alternative. If the District -Attorney
would give" me a" bookkeeper Tall' this trou
ble might not have happened." ;

SULLIVAN MAKES
NEW STATEMENTS
In accordance with her custom inau
purated at the beginning- of this year,
Mrs. Kincaid, president of the Board of
Kducation, was the hostess at a charm
ing informal reception last niffht in the
rooms 'of the board at the City Hall.
The gTiests who partook of the hospital
ity of the lady who is guiding 1 the des
tinies of the School. Board with recog
nized ability, were the principals and
teachers of the various high schools.
The main room was tastefully adorned
with choice cut flowers which were
etrewn about in careless profusion. Mr?.
Xincaid was assisted in receiving by the
Hisses JefOrs. Directors Mark and Den
man were also present to lend dignity to
an occasion which means much to the
teachers of the department, as it is Mrs.
Kincaid's determination to bring them in
to closer social touch bv means of these
featherings.
The evening was pleasantly spent In an
informal discussion of general topics per
tinent to the education of tho youthful
mind and more particularly bearing upon
the proper administration of higrh school
affairs. The principal subject suggested
by Mrs. Kincaid for discussion was
Â¦whether the graduation exercises should
be discontinued in high schools. Some
took the stand that it was better to have
no exercises at the close of the term
as they tended to interfere with the
regular class studies. It was the senti
ment that if any exercises wore held at
all it would be preferable to have them
of a simple character.
During the evening the hostess and her
assistants served a light repast which
w'ould up an altogether enjoyable even
ing. Among the puests present were
Kllsha Brooks, principal of the Girls'
Hlffh School: Joseph O'Connor, principal
of the Mission High School; Walter Bush,
principal of the Polytechnic Hij?h School;
Frank Morton, principal of the Lowell
High School, and some forty teachers

"Want ITew Firehouses.
A promlrient sporting 1 man from New
York, who visits the English race tracks
annually, is said to have finally got defi
nite trace of the portrait last year from
a party of American thieves then in Eu
rope, and reported the matter to Pinker
ton, who agreed to pay the reward and
ask no questions concerning Its theft or
subsequent wanderings. ; â¢
Several years ago the convict was dis
charged, after completing his term, broken
in health, and he again opened negotia
tions with the Pinkerton Agency. It was
ascertained that the portrait had been
brought to America fifteen years ago, and
the Asnews were induced through tho
English detectives to renew their offer of
a substantial reward for its recovery.
Last month a member df the firm vis
ited this country in search of 'the miss
ing portrait and was sent by the Pinker
tons from New York to Chicago. There,
on March zl, the picture was recovered
and is now on its way to England.
No specific details of the transaction re
storing the portrait to its rightful owners
are given by the detectives further than
the fact that it was surrendered on the
understanding that the reward would be
paid through a third party and no at
tempt would be made to prosecute the
men who gave it up. It is said that
Charles Becker, alias "the Dutchman," a.
forger, now serving a sentence at San

With one fell swoop the Supreme Court
yesterday blighted the hopes of W. H.
Robinson . and a dozen other plaintiffs
from ever collecting $600,000 from, the
Southern Pacific Company for an alleged
violation. of section 490 of the Civil Code,
which compels corporations to give stop
over privileges to its passengers or pay a
penalty of $200. The importance of the de
cision can be better appreciated when it
Is known that more than 3000 cases are
pending before the courts of the State and
were dependent upon the decision of the
appellate court. . .
The opinion of the court was written by
Justice Garoutte and was concurred in
by a majority of the Justices. It appears
from the opinion that action waa brought
to .restrain, "W. H. Robinson, L. S. Robin
son, Thomas D. Poole, C. "W. Bassett. C.
H. Loomis, Aaron Bretz, "W. N. Griswold,
Frederick Hiller, John Doe, Richard. Roe,
William" Smith, Edward Jones, Samuel
Wllklns, -James Grove, Thomas Adams,
Henry Jackson, Peter Stone, Joslah Bond,
Jonathan Edwards and Joseph Black
from prosecuting about 500 suits which, It
was alleged in the complaint, they had al
ready commenced," and . from, beginning
any other actions based upon claims for
penalties of $200 each which they claimed
were due \ them by reason of the alleged
violation by the Southern Pacific Com
pany of the provisions of section 490 of the
Civil Code. " Â¦"."â¢' Â¦ ' -
The railroad company alleged that Rob
inson et al. comprised a confederacy of in
dividuals who had been seeking .to extort
money from the railroad company by lay
ing apparent foundations for claims to
penalties.
Upon the trial the court found as a fact
that 674 of these actions were pending in
various Justices' Courts, and also found
that 2300 other alleged causes of actfon of
the same general character were held "by
Robinson and others.
It appears that Robinson et al. held
about 3000 alleged causes of action against
the railroad company, -which they were
either prosecuting or threatening to pros
ecute and upon which they were claiming
about $600,000 in ! penalties, or, as they
termed it, ."liquidated damages." *
This important litigation rested upon
section 490 of the Civil Code, which grants
a stop-over privilege to passengers. The
section alluded to is as follows:
Every railroad corporation must provide, and.
on being tendered the fare therefor, fixed as
provided in this preceding section, furnish to
every person desiring a passage on their pas
senger cars a ticket which entitles a purchaser
to a ride, and to the accommodations provided
on their cars, from the depot or station where
the same is purchased to any other depot or
station on the line of their road. Bvery such
ticket entitles the holder thereof . to ride in
their passenger cars to the station or depot of
destination, or any intermediate Btatlon, and
from any intermediate stations to the depot of
destination designated in the ticket, at any
time within six months thereafter. Any cor
poration failing to so provide and furnish tick
ets, or refusing the passage which the same
calls for when sold, must pay to the person so
refused the sum of $200.
The foregoing section was construed by
the Supreme Court as granting stop-over
privileges to the passengers in the case of
Robinson vs. the Southern Pacific Com
pany, which is reported in volume 105 of
the California Reports, page 526. It has
been strenuously contended that the sec
tion had no such' effect, but the appellate
court determined that the railroad com
pany was mistaken in its contention as to
the law. Justice Garoutte, who wrote the
opinion, continues as follows:
Pending the decision of that case these ap
pellants most industriously engaged in the busi
ness of manufacturing the 3000 alleged causes
of action here involved. No case Is found In
the law books where an undertaking of this
character ever assumed such proportions and
where the spirit of speculation was carried on
daily for weeks, months and even years with
all the method of a great business undertaking;
and it may be well to suggest right here that
the law and the facts should be very plain
before any court would assist appellants car
rying out this questionable venture to a suc
cessful end.
In the enactment of the section of the code
the Legislature only intended to give the stop
over privilege to holders of tickets desiring to
exercise it. It would be a reductio ad ab
surdam to say that it . was Intended for any
other purpose. That is the entire force and
effect of the act; and it stands the same as If
it had said in plain and direct words: "A pas
senger holding a ticket and desiring a stop
over privilege is entitled to It by virtue of this
ticket," . but a desire to exercise a stop-over
privilege, and a desire to lay the foundation
for a cause of action by securing the refusal of
the stop-over privilege, cannot exist in the
mind at the same time. They are wholly ir
reconcilable and cannot stand together.
The evidence in this case is sufficient to sup
port the material findings of fact made by the
trial court.' and we will, not deal with it in
detail. It shows that these appellants combined
and concerted together to create these alleged
causes of action with the sole end in view of
securing the penalties or damages provided for
in the aforesaid section of the code, and that
fact is a vital point in the case.
The findings further establish that these ap
pellants did not desire the stop-over privilege,
but on the contrary, in making their demands
for such privilege, a desire that those demands
should be refused. It is. further found that ap
pellants stopped over, in Oakland in transit to
Alameda, for the single purpose and object of
securing a refusal upon a subsequent train of
the stop-over privilege, and thus lay the foun
dation for a cause of action.
There Is some general evidence that upon
twenty of these occasions when stop-over priv
ileges were denied certain of these appellants
had business in the city of Oakland." But the
evidence to this effect Is not clear and explicit,
and in view of the fact that 2980 of the stop
overs were made when the parties had no busi
ness, did not desire to stop over and demanded
the privileges simply to lay the foundation for
a suit based upon a denial thereof, we feel that
the court was entirely justified In placing these
twenty refusals in . a common receptacle with
the remaining 2980. .

and my complexion became clear aa-i
rosy. I gained in weight quickly anil
friends and neighbors commented on the
remarkable change. . -%-r^
"I have been constantly growing better
and now am feeling In finer condition
than ever before in my life, and I cau
surely say that I owe it all to leaving of
coffee and using Postum Food Coffee... .
"My 16-year-old Bister, like â¢ myself,
drank coffee from a child. For the last
four years she was able to go to school
cr.ly a part of the time and the doctor
Eai<i she should not study at all. I In-
duced her to cult coffee and now her
bright eyes and fresh, fair complexion
show the result."
It wiJI be noticed that It took some
months before this woman secured the
remit. she wanted in the matter of com-
plexion and flesh. The change from coffee
produces a change In this particular
within a month usually, but it is evident
in her case that it required time to
change the corpuscles of the blood, arul
that when that change was made the re-
covery was very rauid.

IT GOES ON PILES MULTIPLY
:S NOT A FAD -IS HEBE TO STAY
Paine's celery compound marks a tro-
mendous stride in the cure of disease.
No other remedy has ever succeeded in
driving out the underlying causes of ner-
vous and organic trouble so surely and
rapidly. No remedy represents so com-
prehensive "a knowledge of nervous ex-
haustion and the best means for its alle-
viation. .-
"It benefited me at once, and I do not
hesitate to recommend it to my friends
who find themselves in the same nervou3
condition.
"Very truly yours,
"Chas. C. Whitney."
"Dear Sirs â I have been familiar with
the merits of Paine's celery compound
for a number of years, and have used 5t
when seriously 'run down' from ove--
work, both mentally and physically.
But its good qualities never appealed to
me ' so forcibly as during the last cam-
paign. The hard work devolving upon
me, as Secretary of the State Central
Committee, affected my nerves greatly
and made it difficult for me to sleep.
Paine's celery compound immediately re-
stored the tone to my nervous system and
enabled me to secure refreshing sleep.
.His duties in these two capacities are
at times so exacting that he finds himself
worn out and in a low nervous condition.
At all such times he confidently turns to
Paine's celery compound, and has nevev
been disappointed.
He says of this wonderful remedy:
"St. Paul, Feb. 16, 1901.
Chas. C. "Whitney has been at the
head of the Bureau of Public 'Printlnor,
State of Minnesota, for many years. HÂ«.-
is also secretary of the Republican Stale
Central Committee.
It cures where other remediesâ because
they are either silly nostrums or well-
meaning but old-fashioned and Ignorant
preparationsâ have been tried and found
futile.
Paine's celery compound was first pre-
scribed by Professor Edward E. Phelp*.
M. D., LL. D., of Dartmouth College, In
his private practice. It has been recom-
mended by learned specialists in nervous
diseases. By its merit alone It has earned
the highest commendations from physi-
cians, the press and the public. It not
only regulates the nervous system, but
nourishes it; sends more and better blooi
to supply the wasted nerves and take*
the killing: strain off the kidneys.
When pains appear in different parts
of the body and one feels tired, and de-
pressed, the use of Pairie's celery com-
pound will drive away tho rheumatism
pain or the attack of indigestion and cor-
rect the failing appetite, which keeps
pace so closely with the digestive powers.
Paine's celery compound has proved It-
self to be the most advanced remedy yet
discovered for tired brains and worn-out
nerves.
Nerve "tension Is disguised under a good
many symptoms that lead thoughtless
persons to apply some useless local rem-
edy when the only lasting relief will coma
froni purified blood, kidneys aroused to
work, stomach secreting abundance of
digestive juices and a toned-up state oi
the nerves.
For all this there Is no need of further
proof as to the value of Paine's celery
compound than can be furnished by the
reader's own neighbors if one will take
the pains to make inquiries.
The best test of the worth of Paine's
celery | compound is to use it yourself. .

unfavorable weather conditions. While the gen
eral tendency of this speculation has been bull

bearish movements In wheat and corn, which
have lowered the level of those products for
the time being. The general consensus is that
retail Easter trade has been to some extent
curtailed by rains In the cities and by bad
roads in the country districts, but as above
noted, these are really only temporary phases,
and the general outlook, alike as to crops and
ss to spring trade as a whole, is in a high

some recurring weakness, shows that at pres

Although the closing: of the stock exchange
both Good Friday and to-day has reduced the
business week in Wall street to four days, it
will rank as one of the most exciting periods
in the history of the stock market. Enormous
dealings in securities, with a speculative spirit
which seemed running to extremes, were the
rule throughout. The presence of the public as
buyers of securities was on a larger scale than
for years past, but, on the other hand, the
manipulation was of a most open kind and was
conducted with a degree of skill that has nevet
been equaled. Heavy realizing sales were wit
nessed, both in the United States Steel stocks,
which were the leading features of the market,
and the prominent railroad stocks. At the same
time the buying demand seemed to absorb the
heavy offerings and any favorable rumors were
accepted with avidity and served to keep up
tliÂ«Â» advances. Not until Thursday, when the
holiday induced realizing by the professionals
and when a rise in the rate for call loans to
6 per cent seemed to indicate that the money
market was unable to support the exaggerated
speculation any further, was there a sensible
check to the bullish movement. The outpour
of etocks or. that day was on the largest pos
sible scale and prices yielded all around in
spite of the confident predictions that next
week will witness a renewal of the same con
ditions in the market. The market semed to
be passing through one of those periods of
speculative excitement when facts are disre
garded. At the same time it must be noted
that a good deal of attention was given to clr
oumstanees like the favorable crop outlook and
the continued Increase in railroad earnings, as
well as to the advantageous position of the
iron and other Industries of the country.
Money market conditions also were not dis
regarded and the action cf the Secretary of
the Treasury Jn deciding to purchase bonds for 1
the sinking fund was considered as offsetting
the effect of the current pold shipments. The
treasury purchases of bonds amounted to neai
lv $3.000.fiOO and the disbursements on that ac
oount reduced the drain on the banks for ac
count of th* Treasury to an insignificant sum.
The importance of this in the eyes of the specu
lative community resides In the fact that it Is
-enerally admitted that a large amount of gold
will have to go to Europe during the present
Miring on account of the German and other
Government loans, which are being brought
out.

Portland's Business,
Commercial failures in the first q'uarter of
lf'Gl were S333 in number and $3L70C,486 in
amount of defaulted liabilities, of which 710
were in manufacturing, for $12,504,222. and
2464 In trading, for $14,552,9CÂ«. with 157 others,
pot properly - included In either class, that
owed $4,646,358. Banking defaults numbered
21. with liabilities of $3,441,389. While exceed
ing the eame three months of last year, in
number failures were much smaller in amount,
commercial and financial Insolvencies together
showing a decrease of $21,532,150. Only two
*ears of the last twenty made a better show
ir.g. either In aggregate or average indebted
ress to each failure, while the proportion of
$26 74 to each firm in business and $1 09 to each
$1000 of solvent payments through Clearing
houses are records that were surpassed but
once in two decades. For the month of March
total liabilities were much smaller than . in
the corresponding month of any year since
monthly statements were first published. These
figures Indicate most undeniably that the new
century has opened with business on no un
certain foundation. â
Aggressive manipulation of corn forced prices
to an unreasonable point, from which the fall
was severe; and wheat also weakened, al
though exports from the Atlantic Coast con
tinued liberal. Pork products did not show
the usual sympathy with corn when it reacted,
for Chicago operators absorbed offerings read
ily.
After declining within a sixteenth of 4c it
was not surprising to see cotton recover half
a cent. The oversold condition of the specu
lative market was chiefly responsible and
Southern dispatches gave support by state
ments of unfavorable planting conditions.
Supplies were against any pronoftneed rise In
price, however, and conditions continue ex
trtmely depressing.
The circular of Coates Brothers on April I
made the average of ICO grades of wool 17.99c.
a decline of nearly 1c since t March 1 and 5',Â»c
compared with April. 19C0. Â¦ During th-; past
two weeks, however, the market has steadied
end there is much more trading. Moderate
buying is done by worsted mills.
Shipments of boots and shoes from Boston
ore steadily increasing-, the last week's move
ment reaching 94,453 cases, against 92.975 in
the previous week and S9.034 a year ago. Quo
tations are steady, but it is expected the re
cent declines in leather and hides will make
it possible for the small shoe manufacturers
to cut prices when they are compelled to seek
rev/ business. An unexpected demand has ap
peared for russet shoes, equaling last yearns
business, despite the fact that the lines were
considered less popular.
No sign of lessening demand Is . perceptible
in any branch of the iron and steel Industry.
Mills are accepting contracts for the' closing
months of the year and tlTere Is every indi
cation that 1901 will surpass all records in the
quantity of pigiron consumed by manufac
turers. Thourh capacity has been wonderfully
enlarged during the past five months there
are still many extensions and new plants con
templated. It is also probable that the cus
tomary summer repairs of furnaces and mills
will be accomplished within a shorter period
tban usual, as contracts call for heavy de
liveries right through the .season. Permanence
of prosperity in this industry is becomlne more
certain, as there is less evidence of invlated
prices. Regular quotations have not altered,
except for bars and foundry pigiron, although
all sorts of premiums are paid where prompt
shipment Is required. Although fewer ovens

S.OOO.CCi) tens were made during the quarter.
While the general business world has looked
with amazement at the performance of the
stock market trade has maintained , its even
course and there are many more points of
gain than of loss, with even a slightly steadier
tone in the dry goods market. There some
sellers have withdrawn offers at recent low
prices, though buying is small as yet. Collec
tions in all lines are unusually prompt and
in the building trades contiacts have been
entered into sufficient to furnish a decided
impetus In allied lines during the spring sea
son.

holiday throughout the Eastern States and

sources to-day.
Telegraphic Quotations.
Wheat, Including flour shipments for the
week aggregate 4.698,693 bushels, against 4,499,
635 last week; 3,886,963 in the . corresponding
week of 1900: 3,284,800 in 1899 and 3.778,726 in
1898. From July 1 to date this season wheat
exports are 155,821,428 bushels, against 151,019.
613 last season and 188.348.800 in 189S-S3.
Business failures in the United States for the
week number 188, against 198 last week; 182 in
this week a. year ago; 190 in 1899; 220 In 189S
and 232 In 1897.
Canadian^ failures number 29, against 28 last
week and 25 a year ago.
Weather conditions, except In the Northwest,
have been rather unfavorable to planting and
ground preparation. This Is particularly true
in the South, where cotton planting is retard
ed. Heavy fertilizer shipments point to a
large increase In acreage In the South Atlantic
States. On the other hand, heavy snows in
Kansas and Nebraska, and no less heavy rains
in the Central West, have benefited winter
wheat prospects, which, in Kansas, Nebraska
and Missouri, are reported excellent. Ohio's
wheat condition shows marked Improvement
over last year. In California weather condi
tions have net been favorable, and deciduous
fruits have been hurt by frosts.
ing about a sharp rise, sympathized In by
other hog products. ' It is hard to see how
Iron and steel trade conditions could be im
proved from the standpoint of the seller. De
mand is. large, prices are strong and In raw
and finished lines the' outlook Is regarded as
very Â¦ satisfactory. . Price advances have been
largely confined to finished products, the feat
ures being an advance of 92 per ton in platea
at Chicago and of $4 in eteel hoop prices at
Pittsburg. Southern Iron is strong, and the
change in this branch of trade is well illus
trated by the fact that some old export orders
are being shipped at a price $4 per ton lower
than those now ruling. Iron ore rates have
not yet been announced, but contracts for
Bessemer pig are being made freely for de
livery two or three months ahead. Western
bar. billet and rod manufacturers are booked
so far ahead that they are practically out of
the market and Eastern manufacturers are
considering advances. Western agricultural
implement men complain, of tardy deliveries,
which is. however, largely true of the trade
as a whole, and some manufacturers are buy
ing as far ahead â¢ as December next.
Eastern shoe manufacturers are hurrying
shipments to complete spring orders, and the
aggregate for the week is again In excess of
last week and year. Leather is firm, but quiet,
at Boston. At Chicago sales are small with
prices steady. Heavy leather is rather easier
at Philadelphia, in sympathy with I the weak
ness in hides. 1

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been throe arrivals of coal from
British Columbia, S447 tons; lour from Wash
ington. 10,935 tons; two from Oregon, 760 tons;
total, 20,202 tons. This is a shrinkage from
our usual arrivals, still it will not be felt, as
we have ample on hand for all current require
ments. Notwithstanding the partial displace
ment of coal by other fuels, the deliveries of
coal for the first three months of 1901 are only
about SOW tons less than the quantity con
sumed In a similar period last year, thus
clearly^ verifying what I have always main
tainedâthat the incoming of fuel oil will only
dislodge a proportion of other fuels. - The pro
portion may be large, still the annual increased
demand for fuel will. always Insure a market
here for at least one million to one million
and a quarter tons annually. Foreign will
only be imported in very meager quantities,
as high, coal prices are pervading the world.
This is a retroactive disadvantage to our far
mers, as no inward freights for ships ' signifies
high outward freights on grain. With coal, ce
ment, ( firebricks and pig-iron eliminated from
our imports, carriers have -a slim show for se
curing- freight. I include cement and firebricks
as our market is oversupplied pro tem. The
market for fuel oil Is 'thrice confounded,' and
will remain so until the producers, consumers
and carriers form a trinity for mutual bene
fit and an established price gauge is regu
lated." ..."

Mr. Pierce then spoke on j "Labor.

There Is much for the American Federation

maintain Its existence until within a few years.'
Now we feel .safe in saying that there will be
no more disunion in labor's ranks, but. that
organized labor. will go on with its work till
It has secured Justice Â¦ to every man, woman
and child 1 In this land'. - â¢-
Trades unionism means Â¦ more to me than se
curing short hours and fair wages. . To-day the
American hoir.e' is almost driven out of exis
tence, the life drawn out of husband, Wife and
children that dividends may be paid. We want
to redeem our homes, to save pur children and
send them to school that they may have a
chance In life. Women come to me with tears
in their eyes and beg me to do something fur
them; tell me how they try to live on $3 or
$4 a week. Against these - conditions the
American Federation of Labor Is the only force
In the field. The men can help themselves, but
for God's sake let somebody get in and help
the ciris.
Sometimes we are driven to uee the strike,
the boycott; sometimes it's the only choice. left
except a degraded manhood. Till the forces
on the other side will meet â¢ us fairly on , an
equal plane, until they droa the black list, we
cannot droi> the boycott. Â¦
The time is ripe while California is getting

FLOTSAM FROM WRECK OF
THE RIO COMES ASHORE AT
_ ALAMEDA. ' ' â¢ . Â¦'-_:"'
RITES OF GOOD FRIDAY
ARE OBSERVED IN CHURCHES
ALAMEDA, April 5.â One of two
pieces of flotsam from the wreck
of the ill-fated steamer Rio de
Janeiro that were picked up on
the bay shore' at the foot of Mc-
Pherson street yesterday is calculated to
bear out the theory that the boilers of the
ship" exploded" just as she took the final
plunge beneath the waves. It is a copper
calling-card plate bearing the name of
Miss Rowena Jehu, one of the victims of
the wreck, that is firmly embedded in the
piece of wood that has kept it afloat these
many days, showing that "it must have
been driven into the timber by some ex
plosive force. ' . . â¢ 'â¢ ' '
The flotsam was found i>y Mrs. Josejrti
Boles, a Portuguese washerwoman, living
at 3 Hendriek place. She was gathering
driftwood ' on the shore Â¦ when she . came
upon it. She also found a small trunks
that evidently had been the property of
a, well-to-do Chinese who met his fate
on the Rid de Janeiro. "
. Mrs. Boles called a boy named Joe Cavo
to look at her find. With some difficulty
he forced the lid off, exposing to view a
little wooden japanned box, p. number of
pieces - of silken apparel, some Chinese
notebooks and a wooden die. The clothing
seems 'to be of the best material and in
dicates that the owner was' wealthy. The
notebooks have fancy covers 'and one of
them is described as a Chinese dictionary.
The die probobly contains the name of the
Chinese who lost his life and has been
translated into "Lul He Tief Chee Gun'
by a local interpreter. The trunk itsalf
is well preserved considering the length
of time it has been in the- water and not
a scratch mars its leather exterior. . â¢
There is come controversy over the pos
session of the little box that -was found
inside of the trunk. Mrs. Bole3-says that
young Cavo ran off with It. as soon as he
rattled it and found that something jin
gled inside. She thinks It contained a,
large sum of money. On the other hand.
Cavo Â¦ says he did not ; take the box , and
fhat Mrs. Boles has it. He stoutly denies
that there was any money in it, anyway.
Mrs. Boles told the atory of her find to
Mrs. Arthur M. Hickox. one of her em
ployers, and yesterday afternoon Mrs.
Hickox took some of the articles to the
Chinese Consul In San Francisco. He was
very much Interested in the them and said
that Chinatown would* be -placarded in an
effort to discover the relatives - of the
drowned Chinese. Â¦ â¢ Â¦ -
The wood and name-plate and the trunk
Mrs. Boles, carried to her home. It was
not long before the 'news of the find had
j spread over I the entire neighborhood and
many flocked to see the thines. Amoi,?
those who viewed them was a young man,
who recognized. the name of Miss Rowena
Jehu 33 being that of a victim of the
wreck. He persuaded Mrs. Boles to give
him the wood and date, which he took
to the Jehu home in this city.
It is the opinion of those who saw the
relics that the plate could only have been
so embedded in the timber by a sudden
and great force.. It )s so firmly fixed that
It cannot be moved. ' When the Rio de
Janeiro went down her boilers are said to
have exploded and this explosion is be
lieved to- have caused the death of many
of the struggling passengers and crew.
The members ' of the King's Daughters
lavished a wealth of floral - decorations
upon the apartments at the hotel which
will be the pastor's abode.- Receptions
are to be held next week in' honor of the
newcomers, and the Men's League has
arrangements in hand for a banquet,
Easter Sunday Dr. Baker will preach
his first sermon as pastor. The services

estimated deficit of $38,000 that confronts
the city have led to the submission of sev
eral plans by which the several depart
ments of . the government, including the
schools, may be operated to the close of
the year without impairment of useful
ness.
The plan involves, among other things,
the rebating by the Contra,, Costa Water
Company of its charged for service,
amounting to about $8000, to the city for
the remainder of the fiscal year.
There is a serious legal question in
volved in' this proposition, which 13 now
under consideration by City- Attorney
Johnson and Special Counsel Hayne in the.
vrater case.
The water company has agreed to make
this rebate, provideo. the city wlU pay the
accrued bills for this fiscal year, which
amount to 525,000. These bins have not
been paid because the city's counsel has
contended that they are not legal claims
against the city. The contention has been
that the water company's attempt to col
lect under last year's ordinace is unlaw
ful. While the company has enforced
payment against individual consumers,
the corporation made no move to compel
the city to pay for its water, although
bills based on the rate of 1S99 were pre
sented monthly.
The problem is now whether the city
will involve ltse.f in any awkward Itjgal
situation by accepting the rebate upon the
conditions imposed by the water com
pany.
The Oakland Gas, Light and Heat Com
pany, through Manager John A. Brltton,
has voluntarily offered to remit Us bills
for April, May and June, thus saving $4000
to the city. There is no legal obstacle in
the way of an acceptance of this donation
toward the canceling of the deficit.
Another source from which it is hoped
to secure a cleaning up of a large portion
of the prospective shortage is by carry
ing over to the next fiscal year the statu
tory salaries, amounting to about $28,CC0.
If the City Council shall accept these
three propositions the deficit will be over
come on the face of the books, but there
will be carried- over the water company's
demand for'future payment of the claims
entered up to April 1 of this fiscal year.
There will be a conference to-morrow
between City Attorney Johnson and Spe
cial Counsel Hayne upon the legal phases
of the tender.

The City, Attorney has been requested to
lose no time in drafting the required pa
pers, upon which the . City Council can
speedily act. The serious side of the situ
ation is in the fact that officers of the
city government who fail to file the suf
ficient bond required by law cannot be
considered as, qualified to serve- in "their
respective capacities. The City Attorney's
office realizes the importance of i imme
diate action, and it is expected that the
subject will be in hand for presentation
at the next meeting of the City Council. .
As soon as this report was laid before
Mayor Snow he presented it. to members
of the former Council. No' action was
taken upon the â¢ matter. Â¦ with the result
that the outgoing Mayor was compelled to
turn the subject over to his successor,
Mayor Barstow, as. unfinished business.
Expert- Cornell was instructed by the
Mayor to carry his investigations of all
matters in connection with the adminis
tration of the government to the minutest
point. In the course of his work he came
upon these bonds, many of which, in po
licemen's cases, were filed years and years
ago and have never been examined, since.
The result has been that the expert, in
running down each surety upon the bonds,
found that in many instances signers were
dead, in other cases they had become
financially irresponsible and in still others
they had left the State and could not be
traced. In the neighborhood of seventy
five bonds were thus put under examina
tion.
Half the bonds filed by. policemen and
other employes and officials of the city of
Oakland are^not . Â¦worth the paper upon
which they are printed." This condition of
affairs is revealed; in a report which has
been made by City Expert Cornell to the
Mayor. Immediate steps Â¦ to' correct the
situation will be ' taken by Mayor Bar
stow, who has laid the report before City
Attorney Johnson . for necessary action.
The City Council will be called upon at
once to make the necessary move to com
pel the filing- of new bonds. . -
The condition is a legacy from the
former, administration. Behind it is a
story of the failure of the last Council to
remedy the startling- state ' of | affairs,
which was called . to its i attention by
Mayor Snow before he retired from office.
The trouble is in the main' due to neglect
and carelessness of former officials to
make the searching investigation which
has disclosed the utter, worthlessness of
the official guarantees.

FIRST SHOVELFUL
FOR THE FACTORY
Work Begun on West
Berkeley Furniture
Establishment.
BERKELEY, April 5.-Ground for the
new furniture factory In West Berkeley
was broken to-day. J. A. Marshall, who
has the contract for the cement and foun
dation work, put on a force of men this
morning. Trie lines of the building were
marked and excavations were com
menced. ' The contract calls for the finish
ing of the foundation within forty days
after it Is started.
The factory, when completed; is expect
ed to be of great assistance to Berkeley
commercially. Other enterprises of thf>
same sort will undoubtedly follow its lead
and locate in the West End. Already
capitalists are > looking over the ground
with a view to erecting a glass works. Â¦_
When the proposition of building. a fur
niture factory was laid before the people
of this i city last year money was -raised
and the land upon which the factory is
now being built was purchased. The peo
ple hold the deed in escrow, but the land
will become the property of the furniture
manufacturing company within two years,
providing the agreement entered into with
the people is carried out. Â¦â¢Â¦...
- E. J. Bruschke, manager Â¦ of the com
pany, agreed tC employ 500 men and boys
continuously for two years after the fac
tory opened. Mr. Bruschke . hopes .that
this number will be increased to 1000. , The
town has granted the company a right "of
way from the property on Third street to
the water front, and the promoters of th3
factory will build a wharf three-quarters
of a mile long to deep water. .- -

CAUSE OF LABOR
IS THEIR THEME
Mass-Meeting Addressed by
"Well-Known Speakers on
Trades Unionism.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, April 5.
The Rev. B. Fay Mills presided over a
mass-meeting in the Interests of labor to
night at Elite Hall, at which National Or
ganizer Pierce of the American Federa
tion of Labor made the principal address.
Mr. Mills said In opening' the meeting-:
Human society is a living, growing organism,
and the hand cannot Bay to the head, "I have
ro seed of thee." I should like to 6ee the day
when the only people on the earth would be
working people. In fact thr-y are so to-day;
the ethers are dead aud don't know it.
In an ideal state of society the wealth that
is created by the community, or is the gift of
rature. would belong to the community.: That
ideal state fs on Its way here. In the mean
time what shall we rely on except the re
rources of organized labor? It Is hard to real
ize that it is a scant twenty-five years since
a labor union was first legally recognized. At
the present day as Andrew Carnegie, who has
Toug-ht labor unions fairly and squarely all his
life, has Just gone out of control of a. great
corporation, hte place has been taken by , a
man who, now presiding over a concern five
times greater, publicly announces that In all
the dealings of the United States Steel Com
pany the interests of organized labor shall be
recognized. j Â¦
Organized labor has stood for the uplifting
ot women, for peace instead of war. for union
Instead of discord. And now It is coming to
be recognized that labor has something to say
about its chare of the profits of Its toil.
Mrs. J. D. Pierce was next introduced
and said:
The men struggle alonr and do the best they
oan. but at a certain point they find their limit
and fcave to call m the women to help them
out. J^ow we women are bejinning to help
More especially for our own sakes we need
labor organizations for women and especially
lor eirls. We have incentives that must ap

Last Tuesday night the new advisory
board was organized. It is composed of
the grand dictator, grand vice dictator,
grand ltpresentatlves and grand trustees.
This board is to have charge of the ex
tension work and the disbursement of
moneys not specially appropriated. ,Orand
Dictator Archibald wa3 elected chairman
and Grand Reporter Johnstone secretary.
The board -will hold meetings on the sec
ond Saturday of each month.
The grand dictator has Issued aÂ»c!rcular
calling for a convention, to consist of
three members from each lodge, to ar
range for the annual picnic to be given
May 30.
Last .Monday night there was a. large
attendance at Yerba Buena Lodge, on
which occasion p visit was paid by the
grand dictator, the grand vice dictator
and. Supreme Representatives Solomon
and Crowe. There was work In the initia
tory degree and addresses by the visitors.
. Two of the officers of the Grand Lodga
of the Knlzhts of Honor chosen at the
recent session of that body are Charles
H. Holcomb, re-elected grand vice dicta
tor, and Ben I. Salomon, elected supreme
representative, have In the past proved
most active workers for the order and
each promised to redouble his efforts to
bring the order prominently before the
public.

The boat which will be designed by tha
board of construction will probably not bo
of the submerged type, but of a sub
aqueous type, and will make a speed of at
least' sixteen knots an hour. Information
obtained regarding the resistance to pro
pulsion of a submarine boat shows that
without the expenditure of enormous pow
ers it is difficult to get a speed of more
than three or /our knots under water. It
is the idea of the members of the board
of construction that a boat which will run
awash will be as difficult of detection as a
submarine boat, can be steered . without
trouble and can accurately discharge Its
torpedo at a target.
Secretary Long upon the return of Rear
Admiral CrowninshieZd. chief of the bu
reau of navigation, has directed the board
to submit plans and data concerning sub
marine boat construction. This action is
of the utmost importance, as it means
that the Navy Department will continue
its vigorous opposition to the effort* of
the Holland Submarine Torpedo Boat
Company to secure legislation in directing
tha construction of additional Holland
beats.

Catholics and Episcopalians Attend
Special and Elaborate Services :
on the Anniversary of the
, V â¢ Crucifixion.
'Good Friday, the -anniversary of the
/crucifixion of Jesus, was observed yester
day with the most impressive and solemn
I services in all the Catholic and Episcopal
churches. The occasion is - one of -the
greatest sancity to Catholics and the most
magnificent ceremonies obtain through
out the day.
g No Ceremony of transiibstanilation is
performed on Good Friday, but the sanc-
{ tiflcation of two hosts occurs on Thursday
and the mass of the presanctified i3 cele
brated the anniversary of | the cruci
fixion. Black vestments are worn by the
priests and the whole service differs from
that of any other day in the year.
.At the opening service the priest pros
trates himself before the altar, after
which comes the reading of the Scriptures*.
Prayers are offered for the dignitaries of
the church and for the peoples of the
I earth. The singing of the "Passion," ac
, cording to St. John, is one of the most
jsacred part3 of the service. The cross
is solemnly unveiled and as solemnly
adored. "The Improperaria" are then
sung to express the ingratitude with
which Jesus was received.
The procession of the holy sacrament
brings the presanctifled host : from, the
repository, where it has lain since Thurs
day, and immediately after receiving com
munion the priest leaves the altar.
In the -afternoon comes the stations of
the cross and a sermon. The usual ser
vice of the evening Is a sermon and a
repetition of the stations -of the cross,
although the latter is some times replaced
by a musical service.
His Grace, the Most Reverend Arch
bishop Patrick W. *Riordan r officiated at
St. Mary's Cathedral yesterday and the
church was thronged from an early hour.
Rev. Fathers J. B. Hannigan, C. A.
Ramm and Joseph Byrne sang "The Pas
sion." Father Hannigan gave the stations
of the cross and the sermon In the after
noon and Father Philip O'Ryan conducted
a similar service in the evening. Father
O'Neil gave the stations and sermon at
St. Dominic's last evening.
The Tenebrae, consisting of matins and
lauds, was given last night at St. Mary's
Church and. the sermon was preached by
Father, Moran. Rev. M. Barry gave the
1 stations and the sermon at St. Patrick's
Church. Father Yorke conducted the
services at St. Peter's Church.
The usual services of the Episcopal
churches consist of the three hours' de
votion: The service is divided into seven
parts to commemorate the seven words
of Christ spoken on the cross. Eacn word
is followed by an address, a hymn, medi
tation and prayer.
The services at Trinity Episcopal
Church were conducted by Rev. Fred
erick "W. Clampett. The ceremonies were
very Impressive and the musi' exception
ally fine. Solos were sung duÂ».ng the de
votion by Mrs. Birmingham, Mi3S Millie
Flynn, Mrs. Tenny, Miss X. Roberts, T.
G. Elliott, F. G. B. Mills and H. M. For
tescue. .
At. St. Luke's Episcopal Church the or
der of service at each of the seven words
of Christ was as follows: Hymn, address
hymn, silent prayer and meditation,
prayers.

Declares That a California Candidate Should Be Selected for
the Diplomatic Position. Â£ â
United States Senator Thomas K. Bard
is among the guests at the Occidental
Hotel. He expects to leave the city to r
day to join his family in the Santa Cruz
Mountains. , f*
Speaking of^Dr. Chester Rowell last
night the Senator said:. "Many of Dr.
Rowell's friends have suggested his ap
pointment as Minister to Japan to- suc
ceed Mr. Buck of Georgia. The doctor
possesses especial fitness for service in
Japan. He has lived in that country and
is highly regarded by the Japanese. . The
topic of his selection for diplomatic duty
In. the Orient has been discussed among
his friends, but I did not know until I
read The Call this morning that the news
papers had been informed of the talk in
regard to his candadacy. In the true
sense of the term Dr. Rowell is not a
candidate or an aspirant for this or any
other office. Â» - Â¦ ,*>
"The suggestion of his fitness for the
position emanates from his friends, many
of whom believe that a . change of sur
roundings and performance of duties in
a new field would prove beneficial to him.
I am satisfied that he would accept the
position if it were offered to him and I
doubt if a better man for the place coul'l
be chosen."
Dr. Rowell Is a -well-known citizen of
high character and recognized usefulness.
He was elected from Fresno to the State
Senate in 1S79 and served throughout tho
twenty-third and twenty-fourth sessions
of the Legislature. He was again elected
to the State Senate in 1898 and served
throughout the thirty-third and thirty
fourth sessions, inciading the extra ses
sion of the thirty-third. Seven years ago
he was appointed a Regent of the Uni
versity of California for a term of six
teen years.
Isters to foreign territory requires that
citizens of the Pacific Coast should be
chosen for diplomatic service In the
Orient.
To-night the public will be given an op
potunity to inspect the New Bohemian
Cafe at 711 Market street that is pro
nounced by those capable of judging as
unequaled . in cost, decoration and' ap
pointment by any saloon in America.
Every fixture and "ornamentation ha?
been secured at the hands of those who
rank the. highest among the artisans of
San Francisco. An adequate description
without illustration of the splendid taste
displayed in the selection of each fitting
and decoration and the harmonious color
ing of wall and ceiling. with the substan
tlaJ fixtures and furniture would be im
possible. The woodwork is both artistic
and substantial and is constructed of solid
mahogany, . highly polished. The back
bar particularly is a notable piece of
furniture and instantly compels admira
tion. The work was designed and con
structed by the Home Manufacturing
Company of this city. Â¦
The decorations of walls and ceiling are
entirely in oil and were done by P. V.
Bush, the noted artist. Four distinct sub
jects in the nude, of surf scenes, .orna
ment the celling and are .highl;' artist-c
and most cleverlyi executed. Electrical
chandeliers of great beauty, represent the
best workmanship of Thomas Day & Co.,
while the art glass work was furnished
by the California Art Glass Bending and
Cutting Works. The brass work was done
by the California Artistic Metal and Wire
Company. The Bohemian Cafe will be
conducted only as a gentleman's saloon.
There will be no card rooms, -no side en
trance and no ladies permitted. A fine,
dainty lunch will be served and a corps
of the most competent and courteous bar
tenders, under the management of Ernest
W ;Langrenbach,.for the past seven years
head bartender of the Hoffman Cafe, has
been engaged. The proprietor Is A. G.
Hagedorn, for the past eighteen years
president of the California Soda Water
Company and a gentleman widely and
most favorably known in business circles.
The cigar stand at the entrance will bo
conducted by Henry Plagemann, who has
engaged the adjoining store at 709 Market
street, to which his wholesale department
will be removed in about .a month. At
that time he will introduce the Flor dÂ«Â»

Senator Bard believes a citizen of Cali
fornia should be appointed Minister to
Japan. He. calls to mind the excellent
service rendered in China by Burlingame
and Avery. and In Japan by John K.
Swift and Frank L. Coombs. The com
mercial business between Japan and the
TJnited States is conducted mainly through
San Francisco. The geographical relation

Woundtd Man Unable to Give a Good
Description of the Desperate
Pairâ Supposed to Be
Ez~Soldiers
The doctors at the Harbor Hospital
have little hope for the recovery "of Al
bert Sinyard, the , sailor who was shot
late Thursday night by footpads. On
account of his serious condition no effort
has as yet been made to locate the bullet.
To Detectives Dinan and Wren, who
are working on the case, Sinyard yester
day told how- he was walking along
Howard street, and when near Spear he
was confronted by two young men, both
of whom wore dark slouch hats, and
was : commanded to throw up his hands.
Thinking they were "trying to have some
fun" with him, as Sinyard expresses it.
he answered them back, when one of the
robbers pointed his revolver at him and
fired. The bullet struck him over the
heart, and as he fell to the sidewalk
they searched hi3 pockets, securing nil
the money he had. amounting to $150.
After they fled Sinyard regained his feet'
and walked to Steuart street, where he
met a friend to whom he feebly told the
story of. the shooting. As he was erow
ing weak from the loss of blood his Irienfl
lost no time in conveying him to the
Harbor Hospital. , â¢ * â¢ . .. .
'Even if the unfortunate man should
recover it is extremely doubtful if he
would be able to identify the murderous
footpads in case they fall into the hands
of the police. Beyond declaring they were
both smooth shaven and appeared to be
young men. he is unable to give a de
scription of them.
â¢ The detectives are satisfied the desper
ate robbers are ex-soldiers. They are
also convinced they are the. same men
who fired three shots at William Fitz
gerald only a short time before Sinyard
was wounded. Fitzgerald was walking
along Fremont street, near Mission, when
he was met by. the robbers, who ordered
him to throw up his hands. Anxious to
save 1 what little money he had. Fitzgerald
started to run, "when one of the footpads
opened fire on him. Fortunately for Fitz
gerald . the bullets went wids of their
mark. His description of the men tal
lies with that given by Sinyard. except
he Is satisfied they wore derby hats.

CIRCUIT COURT
Chief Engineer of the Rio
de Janeiro Appeals to
Judge Morrow. .
Contends That He Should Have Been
Served With Written Charges
Before His License Was
EÂ«voked.
P. H. Herlfhy, chief engineer of the
Eteamshlp Rio de Janeiro when that ves
sel went down off the Golden Gate, ap
pealed yesterday to the United States
Circuit Court from the decision of the
United States Inspectors of Local and
Foreign Steam Vessels revoking his li
cense as an engineer. Herlihy states In
his appeal that he was not served with a
copy of the charges, and was not given
an opportunity of defending himself.
The inspectors found that Herlihy was
puilty of neglect of duty on the occasion
of the wreck of the Rio de Janeiro ana
they revoked his license. In Herlihy s
case the usual precedent was followed In
accordance with the regulations govern
ing the inspectors. Whenever a wreck
occurs the chief surviving officer Is re
quired to make a written report to the
inspectors giving the salient details of
the accident. Then an investigation is
had, no charges btlng filed against any
one. Should the investigation show that
anv officer was puilty of grrops negligence
or 'otherwise failed to perform his duty
the Inspectors find accordingly and Im
pose a penalty of suspension for a definite
period or revoke ihÂ« license of the de
linquent. This course was followed In the
Rio de Janeiro ease and such is the course
pursued by United States Inspectors all
ever the country. Â¦
Judge Morrow set April 15 as the date
for argument on the appeal. Harry W.
Hutton will appear for Hertlby.
HIFFEEENCE BETWEEN
TOWAGE A2H) SALVAGE
Judge de Hav^n Decides That the
Fflueger Was Assisted but
Kot Saved.
United States District Judge de Haven
handed down a decision yesterday in the
case of the I>. B. White Lumber Com
pany vs. the German bark J. C. Pflueger,
etc.. a suit for salvage.
The Pflueger left San Francisco July
11, 1900. bound for Queenstown, and on the
next day was injured by a squall and was
obliged to put into Santa Barbara Chan
nel. 200 miles distant. Here she hailed the
t-teamer Greenwood with signals of dis
tress, and at the solicitation of the mas
ter of the Pfluegrer the Greenwood towed
th*Â» bark into Santa Barbara harbor.
Under the litigation the Pflueger was
Fold for $15,250. Judpe de Haven held that
the service rendered by the Greenwood
was mere towagre service and not salvage;
that the bark was in no immediate peril,
being still able to carry sufficient sail to
make headway, and that the towage serv
ice was worth $350. which sum was award
ed the plaintiff, the owner of the Green
wood. The libel of intervention ; by the
master and crew of the Greenwood was
dismissed.
