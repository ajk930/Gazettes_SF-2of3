HONOR NEGRO BICYCLIST
AND OVERIiOOK VANDERBILT
WILLIAM DRESBACH, fa
mous in the wheat markets
of the world and known all
over the Â¦ country as the
"wheat king," passed away
et his residence, 2520 Union street, yes
terday, after a short illness. Death
was due to heart failure. He had*
been ailing for the past three days and
was confined to his home. He retired on
Thursday evening feeling 1 tired and weak.
At 5 o'clock yesterday morning his condi
tion became alarming and Dr. Ward was
called. Mr. Dresbach expired at 5:20, just
before the physician arrived.
Mr. Dresbach was 67 years of- age.
Mr. Dresbach at one time was looked
apon as the Kapoleon of the wheat market.
When the crash came that swept away
his fortune many other wealthy men were
ruined and the fortunes of still others
were seriously Impaired. It Is said of him
that he cost James G. Fair $4,000,000 and
J. C. Flood even more. His effort to cor
ner the 'wheat market of the -world was
not only disastrdus to the Nevada Bank,
which was backing him. but also to him
self to an even more serious extent.
The most remarkable Incident in the va
ried life of Mr. Dresbach was his connec
tion with the Flood and Nevada Bank
u'heat deal. This was In 18S7. At that
time there was a well defln'ed rumor that
General Boulangcr was about to "over
throw the French Government and that
4 war In France would be the result.
Speculators In this country, anticipating
the probable turn in affairs, attempted, to
corner the wheat market. Among them
was William Dresbach. He was then a
prosperous broker doing business at 316
California street and a prominent mem
ber of the Produce Exchange, having been
IU presiding officer for two terms. George
W. Brander was then manager of the
Nevada Bank and he gave Dresbach mil
lions with which to speculate in wheat.
It is said to this day that this vast sum
was given without the knowledge of either
John W. Mackay or Jaraes C. Flood, the
owners of the bank.
Disaster in Wheat Pit.
Speculation was rampant at this time
tnd the wildest excitement prevailed.
Dresbach was such a power that one "af t
trnoon at a meeting of the Produce Ex
:har.g:e, despite the unanimous vote * of
Mr. Dresbach came to;, this city in 1S77
and opened an office on California street.-
He joined ihe .Produce Exchange,., and
was soon one of its most'promlnent . arid
energetic members. _ He was" elected -vipe
president, and held that office from 1884
Mr. Dresbach .was born. In r the village
of Halve, Germany, In 1S34. . He came to
this country in 1S52 and took up his resi
dence In St. Louis. Although but IS
years of age, he displayed the thrift and
business sagacity that later aided him
In Â¦ his gigantic -ventures, and ' he., soon
had a competency. His business was
general merchandise. At this 'period
gold was discovered on the Fraser River
and excitement -filled the land. Young
Dresbach became possessed of the gold
fever and sold out his store, and, with
many others, started for the land of.
promise. He remained in British Column
bia for some years ,and later drifted to
California. He. settled where the town
of Davisville now " stands, and he has
the distinction of having named thÂ»
town. He opened a store In -this place
and " soon established a prosperous -busi
ness., He bought and sold wheat and gen
eral merchandise. ' As ' a seller of wheat
he' attracted general attention. He be
came connected with the late Isaac
Friedlander, and with his assistance dis
posed of 30,000 tons of wheat in one day.
Dresbacli's Varied Career.
" Brahder lost his position and sank into
obscurity. Dresbach's vast fortune was
swept away. In his anxiety to pay off his:
creditors he lost^every dollar he possessed
and had to begin over again. His wife
saved a little out of the wreck and Dres
bach'set up in business on a small scale. 1
Many of his customers stood by him, but
he never rose to "such an important place
in the market as In the days when he was
called the "wheat /king." He was a reg
ular attendant on Change and dabbled in
"bucket shops" like any other speculator.
" The attempt to corner the wheat mar
ket proved disastrous. - The -. commodity
fell until the speculators were ruined.. J.
C. Flood was in-danger of lqslng his en
tire fortune, and had not the late James
G. Fair come to his assistance he would
have- lost all. As it was he dropped In
the neighborhood of $6,000,000. :
burst.; The price of selling 18S8 wheat,
which' on August" 2 touched $2 17% per cen
tal, fell to $135, and. on Septembef. 6 it
went as low as $122Ui ' ' * ' -
.r Every effort was made "on. the market
to force' prices upward until of
August, 1SS7, when the gigantic bubble
the members 4o do a certain. thing, Dres-'
bach, who was .then, president, opposed
the action, and in a. voice .trembling with
emotion threatened to resign if the rnem v
bers -carried 'out their plan."- This 'startling-;
announcement had Its effect^ The mouth
of every man in the room was closed and
Dresbach had his way. *. .
The funeral will take place to-morrow
morning from the late residence, 2520
Union street. The Interment will bo

Deceased leaves a widow and . four
children.- The latter are Mrs. H. H. Ful

Dresbach and William : Dresbach Jr. The

'Mr.- Dresbach was a member of the
Board of Supervisors appointed by Gov.
ernor Budd to take the place of the oust
ed board. He hefd this office for two
weeks, when the. duly' elected City Fath

was a member of Sacramento Command.

Merchants' Exchange.
â¢ Advocated "Dollar Wheat."
Mr.. Dresbach's taking off. was dis
cussed generally by the wheat brokers.
They all' paid f him the tribute of being
a man who was not only kind, but never
thought ' _ of v himself. During the big
wheat deal that destroyed his fortune
be- saved' many of the small brokers by
selling them enough wheat to allow them
to' fulfill their contracts! One broker Is
reported to have said that when Dres
bach had money, all- brokers had money.
He was. known throughout the State as
the "farmer's friend." He championed
their cause and did everything in his
power to advance their Interests. He al
ways .offered- them high prices for their
!wheat. "Dollar wheat" was his hobby,
and he was a persistent "bull." He was
also' an earnest Â¦ advocate of an associ
ation of farmers for the purpose of ship
ping their own wheat without employ
ing middlemen^ His scheme was never
realized.'
I When the news of his death reached
the exchange yesterday a notice to that
effect was posted on the board, and at
the 11 o'clock session George W. Me*
Near, president of the board, called a
special .-meeting, and formally announced
the demise of Mr. Dresbach. - He said
that 'the funeral -arrangements had not
been ' announced,- but he would declare

Then the District Attorney called w.j.
Mortimer, a dapper young man, 'who said
he was a real estate dealer and a notary
public. Mortimer â¢ had taken a statement
from -Dr.- Jessup and the prosecution
wanted to get it in: evidence. ;
Jessup Did Not -Expect .to! Die.
P. A. Haviland, Deputy County Sur

doors, ' windows," stairways, measure

Dr. G. B. Hoagland, the physician who
attended Dr. Jessup after the shooting-.
The physician was afflicted with a defec

District Attorney Allen was unfavorably
impressed with" Justice Edgar's ideas upon

that an: information alleging murder will
be. filed against Adams, a course < which is
within the province of the District Attor
ney; provided 'he , believes " the evidence
warrants such â¢ a charge. -
In spite of .the seriousness, of the situa
tion for Adams, the hearing in the hot,
stuffy courtroom' at the Town Hall yes
terday was akin to a "'.'comedy of errors."
.;â¢ Error in Complaint. â¢ '; Â¦ Â¦
Matters did not' run smoothly from the
start. The case was well along before the
District Attorney found that the com
plaint he was proceeding under forced
him into the position ofacctising Adams
of haviri"g J murdered Jessup while the"den
tist was still alive. The error ; was in
dates, the complaint reciting that Adams
did willfully, feloniously â¢ Â» â¢ kill and
murder John G/ Jessup on June 17, where
as"death did not occur until the following
day. So after all the morning session had
b*een exhausted the lawyers stopped j pro
ceedings, had a new complaint drawn and
started anew.
, The case hinged on/the testimony of
Miss Agnes .Adams, the -frail, invalid
daughter, who was the Innocent' cause of
the tragedy. For the, first time since the
shooting the father and, daughter, met.
Â¦She was sitting In- the courtroom along

Adams, much - improved in '- appearance
"since 'his' arrest,'. walked briskly ; into. the
chamber, accompanied by Marshal Kerns.

Such w'as the decision of Justice Robert
Edgar of Berkeley yesterday afternoon at
the preliminary examination of . Charles
G. Adams, the former Episcopal minister,
who on June 17 fatally shot Dr. John G.
Jessup at the Adams residence, 1801 Wal
nut street. ;
Adams' attorneys, L. S. Church and Neil
McConaghy, were^satisned with the or

argument for the discharge of his client,

. \ Daughter Tells of the Shooting.
Miss Agnes Adams was next called an
a witness. She was clad in a dark tailor
made . srown.' Her face was screened by
heavy veiling. Her voice was weak and
hardly audible. Her story was the same
as she told at the Coroner's inquest, al
though the. lawyers went less into detail.
She gave the principal points in the tragic
tale, just as she did at the Inquest. She
told of how Dr. Jessup and herself had
gone to the Adams house. They entered
and the doctor stood at the foot of tha
stairs.
; " "Then^ father cried, "Who is there T "
said Miss Adams. "Dr. Jessup replied,
Jit's I,' Charlie/ _ ... ...
" 'Don't come upstairs - or I'll shoot,*
said : father. .and the doctor yelled back.
'I will if -I, have occasion to come.'
- "I asked Dr. Jessup not to 'go up. Then
father* asked if I was there and the doc
tor, said. 'Yes.' ... . '
"Again father said. 'Don't come upstairs
or. I'll shoot.', Â¦
"Dr. Jessup. started up two or three
steps, and.: I: held him by the coat. He

"When Jessup was brought home, he
said, 'I guess I've" got my ticket.' I.re
plied: 'I guess not. : You may pull
with Dr. Jessup concerning* hl3 condition,
Thomas S. Allen, at whose residence Jes
sup lived, was summoned.
" Responding to District Attorney Allen's
queries, Allen said:
; After Dr. Hoagland had given some ad
ditional testimony about his conversations
Â£ "Did , you ; have : any * conversation with-
Dr. Jessup about his j injuries ?" inquired
the 'District -Attorney.
"Yes," sir;, he told me he wasn't golns
to- die," replied Mortimer, and with It
the chances, of getting- that statement
went a-glimmering, for the law requires
an ante-mortem statement, cannot be ad
mitted to evidence unless the person
making it believes he. is about to die.
â¢' "Did' he' say anything else?" queried
Allen', still hopeful.
"He told me he wasn't afraid he waa
goins to die,", was .the.' reply.
"That's all," said the District Attorney.

avenue, could' not assist the District At

Then John , Armstrong, a carpenter at
1531 'Spring street, explained how he found

. Tenill had not finished his testimony
when court adjourned, and he is expected
to give some sensational evidence to
morrow. French's attorney declares the
transaction of French was perfectly
'"square." He had been doing business
for Edwards and merely took the mort
gage in his name to secure Cline. He said
French would deny the charges made by
Ten-Ill.
Burnett, on the stand to-day, testified
that he had never loaned Mrs. Haskell
any money on the mortgage nor had he
received any- consideration when It was
transferred to Edwards. In fact, he did
not believe he had ever signed the mort
gage, although the signature looked like
his.
"When It came . to making out the mort
gage, Cline declined to have it made to
him, and French made it payable to Bur
nett. Later it waa transferred to W. C.
Edwards of Arizona. While Terrill did
not so testify, he claims Cline never re
ceived the money from French, and that
he will prove the assertion.
Attorney Sam B. Terrill, who figured In
the case a few years ago, became in
volved in a shady transaction with \V. A.
Cline and gave Cline a worthless mort
gage to secure a loan of $1200. Cline con
sulted Attorney French when he became
aware he had been duped. French threat
ened to bring the affair before the Grand
Jury unless Terrill paid Cline the money.
Terrill said he understood at the time
that the making of the mortgage was to
save him from prosecution. Under these
threats, so Terrill testified to-day, he in
duced his mother-in-law, Mrs. Haskell, to
give French a mortgage on their home at
College Park for $1200. French then of
'ered to obtain the bogus mortgage from
Cline and all Incriminating papers and
save him (Terrill) from San Quentin.

SEATTLE, June 28.â New light is
thrown upon the Meredith murder case
by the Investigation which has been pros
ecuted since the tragedy. It is learned
that Meredith left his home on the after
noon of the murder with the Intention of
visiting his. room in the police station and
transferring his personal possessions to
his home. He had packed up the articles
belonging td*hlm, among which was the
short gun with which he fired at Consl
dine. About five minutes before the shoot
ing occurred Meredith was seen by De
tective Philbrlck at: the corner of Yesler
way and Second avenue. The ex-Chief
had his arms full of packages at this
time. â¢
It has developed that . the ; Consldlne
brothers were walking about in the neigh
borhood of the drug store for some time
before the shooting and appeared to be
looking for some one. The latest develop
ments point to the supposition that the
Considlnea found Meredith- on his way
home and provoked him to the. shooting.

Millionaire's First Wife Loses Her
Suit for Half of His
Estate.
SPOKANE, June 2S.â The sensational
suit of Mrs. Helen XL Peyton against
Colonel Isaac X. Peyton, the wealthy
mining man of Spokane, ended this morn
ing in a decision by Judge Richardson
finding for the defendant on all points.
The plaintiff, who was the first wife of
Colonel Peyton, sued for $500,000. or half
his property, claiming the divorce he ob
tained in 1SS6 was not legal and asking
that it be set aside, thus invalidating his
second marriage. The court held the di
vorce had been voidable at one time, but
the plaintiff had forfeited all rights by
years of delay. The plaintiff will appeal
to the Supreme Court of the State.
Burglars Make Light Haul.
LOOMIS. June 28.â Burglars effected an

opened the safe and made away with 14

OAKDALB, June 28.â Throughout the
entire day, with the thermometer regis
erlng 108 degrees in the shade, every
available man in" this vicinity has fought
one of the most disastrous grain fires that
has ever swept Stanislaus County. To
night, the conflagration having burned
itself out, there Is a chance to estimate
the loss, and the figures represent the sea
son's earnings o* many a rancher. A strip
of grain fields ten miles long and a mile
wide has been swept clean of its. crops,
a farmhouse and barn He in ashes and
countless trees in the path of the flames
will soon wither and .decay.
The fire started on what Is (known as the
Crooke ranch, three miles east oT Cometa,
just across the line in San Joaquin Coun
ty, and burned in a southeasterly direc
tion, not stopping until the Stanislaus
River checked its course. The Crooke
acres are owned by the German Building
and Loan Society of San Francisco. From
there it spread to the Huffey land, the
property of the San Francisco Savings
Union. The ranch owned by Dr, Langdon
was next swept over and on the Robison
ranch 1000 acres of grain was destroyed.
Fror he Threllfell -ranch, where the
farm.â use and barn were burned, the con
flagration divided into two columns, one
going In. a southeasterly and the other in
a southwesterly direction â one denuding
everything in its path until it reached the
Stanislaus, and the other burning its way
through to the county line.
A conservative estimate places the loss
at $50,000, but it may greatly exceed those
figures. Most of the grain was insured.

directed as strongly as possible In favor
of his aDDointee. . â¢ . â¢â¢ ;
The ousted Commissioner is a Demo
crat and a great friend of ex-Governor
Budd. The fact that Shortridge is of the
same party as Gage and that he might
be of some political use is doubtless, the
cause of McCabe's removal. The law ap
parently states that the appointment is
for a period of four years, but there Is un
doubtedly some good ground on which the
action can be defended. Shortridge has
recently been admitted to the bar and his
legal knowledge probably will be practi
cally tested.
McCabe is very angry and the prospect
of losing the nice job on which he had
builded his hopes for the next two years
cannot but result In sincere disappoint
ment. He declares that he Is firm in his
position; that the appointment of Short
ridge is illegal, and that the office will not
be turned over without a legal battle. Ex-
Goyernor Budd sustains him In his claims
and promises that his own efforts shall be
Governor Gage has within a week or
two appointed D. W. Field of Los Angeles
to succeed Commissioner Gould on the
same board, and it was not generally be
lieved that there would be another ap
pointment until 1903. The plum is a very
desirable one, as it carries considerable
honor and involves but little labor aside
from the collection of $2500 salary an
nually.
SACRAMENTO, June 28.â Governor
.Gage has appointed State Senator
Charles M. x Shortridge to the
Building and Loan Commission, to
succeed E. D. McCabe of Los An
geles. As McCabe was appointed to the
position for a period of four years by ex-
Governor Budd in 1898, the new appoint
ment comes somewhat In the nature of a
surprise. McCabe says that he will not
vacate office until the expiration *of his
term, and ex-Governor Budd has prom
ised to make' the fight for him. Mean
while Shortridge holds'" the appointment
and interesting developments are in order.

the title of 'supervising officer.' By an
agreement between the American and the
Canadian governments,' the office is main

Miller incident Busby ran up his flag
again. He was told to either put the stars
and stripes above or It would come down.

to-rip^a HE ladies and gentlemen of the
1 Alabama Press Association will
I leave for the South this morning,
H bearing with them most delightful
impressions of San Francisco. The
special train of the party will leave the
Southern Pacific depot at j Third and
Townsend streets at 6:50 a. m. The itiner
ary provides for stops en route to Los
Angeles at Palo Alto, San Jose, Del
Monte, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo and
Santa Barbara. The special is due to ar
rive In Los Angeles at 11:30 o'clock to
night.
Yesterday was a day of sightseeing,
which the members of the guild from the
Sunny South will long remember. They
visited Golden Gate Park and the ocean
between the hours of 10 and 2 p. m.. After
a lunch at the Cliff House the party re
turned to the city as they went to the
ocean, on special cars of the Market
street electric system.
Early yesterday morning James O.
Rountree, secretary of the association,
was advised that The Call's efforts to ar
range for the reception of the party
aboard the famous battleship Oregon
were successful. The intelligence was re
ceived by the Alabamans with delight,
and on every hand The Call was praised
for Its enterprise and kindness. The
knowledge that the members would , be
expected aboard the ship at 4 p. m. gave
additional enjoyment to the forenoon's
outing, in the park.
At 2 o'clock the ladies and gentlemen of
the Alabama party were courteously re
ceived by the San Francisco Club, occu
pying the sixteenth and seventeenth floors
of the Clans Spreckels building, and were
enchanted by the fine panorama of San
Francisco as viewed from the windows of
the club. Â¦
In order to safely and speedily convey
the members of the association to the
Oregon The Call engaged an ample num
ber of commodious launches and gave
special directions against overcrowding.
The programme as devised was carried
out to the letter. The guests were aboard
the historic ship at the time appointed,
and never did visitors derive greater en
joyment than that accorded the Ala
bamans who inspected the Oregon. Lieu
tenant N. R. Lee received the visltors.-
Every one of the party -was introduced
by Mr. Rountree. The officers and sailors
of the battleship were attentive and
courteous, replying kindly to all requests
for information. So highly pleased were
the Alabamans that the visit was pro
longed. -^
Before the time fixed for going ashore
Mr. â¢ Rountree assembled the members of
the association aft and asked Major G.
A. Joiner of Talladega to make a few re
marks. The major responded, thanking
the officers of the ship for their courtesy.
He spoke of the loyalty of the whole
country to the flag and the" pride which
the people of Alabama felt in the
achievement of the Oregon. He compli
mented The Call for the enterprise', and
courtesy In making It possible for the
party to see the ship under such favor
able auspices.
Lieutenant Commander Bostwiek re
sponded on behalf of 'the officers and
crew of the Oregon to the sentiments of
patriotism expressed. He was delighted
to >be assured that the people of all the
States were proud cf the Oregon. , .
Jrdgc S. L. Fuller of Cullman, Ala.,
then nerformed the pleasant duty of pre
senting to Mr. Rountree a diamond pin.
The gift, from the Alabama Press Asso
ciation, was . designed to express In some
degree the appreciation of Mr. Roun
tree's efforts to render the outing agree
able to all his fellow travelers.
Mr. Rountree, in accepting the gift, re
marked that the greatest pleasure that he
had derived in the journey was the as
surances that he had contributed to the
comfort and happiness of his compan
ions on the trip. s

. It was in the shops that most' of the
time was spent, for In them the visitors
found the best evidences of the peculiari
ties of- the race that was so new to them.
The usual places were visited, the
opium joints; the josshouses, where the
visitors burned .punks .to their ancestors
and coveted the tapestries and antique
brass jars and ornaments; the theaters,
where blood-curdling Chinese drama was
running at high pressure; the restaurants,
where some of the bolder ones tried a few
Chinese dainties that looked less deadly
than others; the dark alleys, whoe- rec
ords are written in blood; the merchants'
clubs, the highbinder meeting places, the
gambling dens, the slave quarters and the
shops.
One hundred or more, under the guid

"Then what occurred."
"I asked the doctor not to go upstairs,
but he replied. 'Oh. he will never shoot.* "
* Miss Adams was dismissed from the
stand to be followed by Frank E. Arm
strong, who explained that, at request of
his brother John, he had got the pistol
from his brother's residence, where it had
been taken, and turned it over to the
Town Marshal. :>r
Attorney Church made a motion for
Adams' discharge, claiming that the evi
dence showed his client had acted In self
defense. He argued that the law permit
ted a man to repel an assault that was
about to be made upon him, and that In
the present case the act was to be com
mitted in Adams* house and In his own
sleeping apartment.
"The law gave him the right to defend
his home and himself," said Church. . "If
the ' appearances were such as to Justify
Adams in the thought that he was to have
bodily injury inflicted upon him, the law
of this State allows him to take the life
of his assailant. The testimony of Miss
Adams, the principal witness In this case,
shows that Jessup took his coat off and
rushed toward the room."
District Attorney Allen combated that
view declaring that the testimony showed
that Dr. Jessup had stood in the doorway
of Adams' bedroom, without making a
demonstration, and that Adams' shot was
wanton and unprovoked.
In his decision. Justice Edgar said: "I
do not believe for a moment that the de
fendant could be held on a charge of mur
der. The only question Is, whether he
should be held for manslaughter or
whether he should be discharged, the
shooting being deemed a justifiable homi
cide. The motion to dismiss i3 denied.
The matter should go before a jury. If
the defendant, as a reasonable man, be
lieved he was in danger of his life, or In
i danger of great bodily harm, I would see
i another aspect to this case; but I hardly
! think the defendant was in such dan-
I ger."
Then came a mild cross-examination.
"What did your father say when you got
in the house T* asked Attorney Church.
" 'Who is there?' "
"And \ what did Dr. Jessup reply?"
" 'It is I, Charlie. You've got to stop
abusing this girl.' "
"Describe the tone of voice.
"It was rather commanding, sharp and
clear." . -K.'' : Â¦
"And your father's voice?
"Was thick, but sharp."
Dr. Jessup Braved Adams.
brushed my hands away and rushed to
the head of the stairs, pulling off his coat
and hanging it on the newel post. Then
he stepped to the bedroom door and said.
'Shoot, If you wish to.*
"I saw father lying across the bed. He
raised himself and fired a shot. Dr. Jes- (
sup staggered and then -went Into the
room and pounded father with the pistol
or his fists. I couldn't see which.
"I assisted the doctor downstairs as he
staggered out of the room, and helped
him out on the porch. Then I ran down
the steps, screaming."
"Do you think you could recognize the
pistol?" inquired District Attorney Allen,
showing Miss Adams the hammerless
weapon that Kerns had turned over to the
court. >'* v. Â¦--
"It is either that one or a pistol very
like it," replied Miss Adams.

Judfre Henry decided that the Board of

that the jiiace is a disorderly house within

"The Feliing of one, two or a dozen,

TOPEKA, Kans.. June 28.â The Popu- |
list party in Kansas is in chaos, and the |

low. John Curran. secretary of the State j
Committee, says he will close the head- j
quarters here on August 1. In an appeal j
to the membership in the State Curran .
says: !
"On Tuesday I received a report- from j
ex-Governor P. P. Elder of Ottawa of the j
meeting of the County Central Commit- j
tee. In that report he says: unanl- !
mous feeling it that the party is in chaos j
and the theory of keeping open the State j
headquarters and doing any work is vis- ,
lonary and doing no good. I have about j
come to the conclusion that this expresses j
the sentiment of the majority . of the j
Popuiists in the State.' !
"The best evidence that the party is in
chaos Is for the County Central Commit- I
tee to declare that it is. These and many :
other Eisns show a movement of greater
or less proportions toward the Democratic
party. The invitation from the Demo
cratic party to join its ranks is only a
reiteration of the many Individual invi
tations, and there are many who claim it
will be generally accepted. If the re- j
fusal of the Democratic committee to '.
adopt the 'union* idea is endorsed by the !
rank and file there will be nothing: left j
for those who insist on Â¦working with
them but to join the Democratic party.
Those who remain Populists will have to

tion for himself." . .' >

rangement with the Department of Ag
riculture by which the .'epartment will
have the use of the system free and the .
inventor will have the benefit of exploit
ing it commercially.
Scientists and eiectrical experts who
examined Professor Fessenden's work
declare that he is making experiments
on entirely original lines and is not en
croaching in any way upon the devices
used by Senor Marconi. He has so far
cent messages without the aid of wires
over a distance of fifty miles on land
and received replies.
WIIecti was not prepared to say that
these tests on land had been made in all
kinds cf weather. It is now intended to
experiment and see whether the system
â¢will work equally well at sea. The time
for these experiments, he said, would
depend entirely upon the inventor. They
might occur in a month and prove a
great success. In this case the Weather
Bureau would put up temporary lines
for more elaborate experiments.
Secretary Wilson declined to make any
Â«xplanatio'n of the principles of Fes
eenden's system, and all persons con
nected with the "Weather Bureau who
have had access to the apparatus are
under a pledge of secrecy.
The Call's correspondent understands,
however, that Professor Fessenden dis
penses with the "coherer." The "co
herer" is a modification of the Branley
tube. It was Professor Hertz who dis
covered the so-called "Hertzian waves,"
end Professor Branley then fo^nd that
the foeblest Hertzian waves passing
â¢through metal filings in the Branley
tube caused them to cohere and become
a. good conductor of electricity, whereas*
in a loose state they were non-conduct
ors. Signor Marconi then conceived the
idea of utilizing Hertzian waves and the
Branley tube in wireless telegraphy. It
â¢will thus be seen that the Branley tube,
or coherer, is the basic principle of Mar
coni's wireless telegraph invention, and
that if It can be dispensed with this new
system may be used without infringing
Â¦upon Marconi's patent.

carriages containing: the heralds, pursui

Temple Bar and the Royal Exchange,
where the formalities, less picturesque,
perhaps, were repeated. Â¦ Lord Mayor
Green and the Sheriffs met the procession
at Temple Bar.
The trumpeters sounded a protracted

been audible to the royal party, occupy
ing a stand on the grounds of Marl

uniform. Queen Alexandra and the oth

mony with the greatest interest, the King
using field glasses to obtain a clearer
view. /
At the appointed hour four state trump
eters, lavishly adorned in gold embroid

bearing gold maces, and' surronded by the

this kind that took place last Saturday
having proved so successful and interest
ing as to suggest its repetition.- The
bogey score will be between 80 and 90. but
the exact figure will be unknown till the
conclusion of ( the game. Last Saturday
each contestant chose his or her own
handicap, writing it on the bulletin board
before play: began. Fourteen players, of.
whom four were ladles; entered the event
last Saturday; the best score, made by
P. E. Bowles Jr., exactly equaling the
secret, bogey,' 93, which was : drawn from
a box containing slips of paper inscribed
,wlth the numbers from 80 to 100. As P.
E. Bowles Jr. had given himself a handi
cap of .ten, his net- score was ten wide of
the' .mark. The first prize -was won . by
Miss M. R. Deane, with a score of 129 less
35, -or. a net of 94. Miss Anita, Whitney,

On the Fourth of July the San Fran

public as a promoter of professional fights
and Its first dish will be something new to
this -city. Every arrangement .has. been
made to make the venture successful, and
there is no apparent existing reason why
this daylight fight at Sixteenth 'and Fol
som streets should not be all that is hoped
for it by the prize flght management. ,.; v
The card which the. San Francisco Club
has prepared is the kind that appeals to
the fight-going public. Jack. Moff at and
George Gardner are scheduled to appear
In a twenty-round Â¦ mill, the principal
event on the programme. " Moffat has al
ways been a favorite in this city, and up
to the time of his accident when he
fought Al Neill, a substitute for erratic
Tommy Ryan, he was rated as a top
notch middle-weight. From the way Mof
fat has been working during the past few
weeks arm is as good as ever it was,
and He is now in ripe condition.' to* con
test'with the best of : his class for~the
championship honors. George Gardner of
Boston is another crack- heavy middle
weight, and he too has . accomplished
enough in the ring to make his presence
felt with the best : of them. This fight
should prove close and Interesting. > Â¦â¢â¢,-,Â¦Â»â¢â¢..
As a, second offering ; Al Neill and
Charles Thurston will be presented. It is
some time since Neill has Â¦. been seen In
the ring in this city. He is a shifty,'
clever boxer, with tons and worlds of su
perior cleverness to Thurston. The latter,
on the other hand, is stanch and hard, a
fighter from his feet up and as greedy for
punishment as a . parched.- throat " for
drink. Much speculation is Indulged in
about this -fight., It will.be a test of
cleverness against force and strength.

The victory that Palo Alto earned in |
defeating Vandal In the deciding course
of last Sunday's open stake brought more
honors to the great sprinter than would
appear at first glance. When the final
flag in the event was raised in favor of
Geary's fast hound it gave to that flyer
a season's record that placed him at the
head of tho list of America's best grey
hounds. Being Ineligible for to-day's
events, Palo Alto virtually closed his sea
son last week, after having placed to his
credit nine stakes and beating all former
records. Up to this time the honor in the
stake-winning line for a season belonged
to Royal Flush, who with eight events to
his name for a year's work held the
strongest of them for some time. During
the making of this record Royal Flush
captured three stakes in weekly succes
sion, which is in Itself a record.
Wayfarer is also a record holder. Cred
ited to this courser is the great perform
ance of going through three stakes with
out allowing a dog to score against him.
To For Freedom, how ever, belongs a
record which coursing men declare is the
greatest of allâ that of meeting for two
seasons the fastest and best hounds in
running without having a flag raised
against him. For the sake of a well
earned reputation it seemed hard to send
the old courser to the slips after an en
forced retirement and against the clever
youngsters of to-day, though his defeat
in these trials was pardonable and ex
pected.
In England Fullerton in his great stake
won six courses and suffered defeat in the
final, losing to Greengage. After that he
won twenty-five courses in succession.
Fullerton ran in five Waterloo cup events,
captured four of them and in the fifth lost
to Full Captain in the second round.
Herachel has thirty straight courses to
his credit.
Master McGrath won twenty-seven
straight, lost one and won ten more
straight. â¢:. -. -i Â«,.Â».
Coomassie won twenty-eight courses
without a slip.
Huicholloa, grand sire of Emin Pasha,
won sixteen.
For Freedom in the plains meet* and
park stakes in which he contested and
never knew defeat has at least forty-five
courses to his name, a record which com
pares Quite favorably with the world's
greatest coursers.
Palo Alto has taken second money three
times during- last season. â¢>,',-
D. J. Healey's Sisquoc performed for a
while in a manner that bode ill to records
but did not finish. In five starts Sisquoc
reached first place three times\ and sec
ond place twice. . '

COURSERS THAT
HAVE WON FAME
AND BIG MONEY
The Pacific Coast Trotting Horse Breed
ers' Association has hung up six guaran
teed stakes of $1000 each, three of which
are for trotters and three for pacers.
These stakes will close on Monday. July 1.
For the trotters a 2:14. 2:20 and 2:40 class
are provided, while the side wheelers get
races for the 2:13, 2:17 and 2:25 classes.
These are only the preliminary purses for
the breeders' ireetlng, which takes place
at Sacramento from July 30 to August 3.
inclusive. Other purses for other classes
will be offered, to close about July 15, but
they will be for small amounts. Entries
for the Los Angeles meeting will also
close on July I, and their meeting, which
opens September 28, will be continued for
thirteen days. Ir a Jdition to these meet
ings the circuit will include Woodland.
Stockton, the State Fair, Santa Rosa. Sa
linas, Santa Ana and probably San Jose.
At all of these places harness races will
be given, as well as at all the smaller
county fairs.
Although the harness racing circuit in
California will not be an extended one this
year, some very good meetings will be
held, and as there are a large number of
trotters and pacers In training, especially
for the green classes, the entry lists
should be larger than for years past. Cal
ifornia Is well represented throughout the
Eastern grand circuit. One or more Cal
ifornia horses are entered In nearly ev
ery stake. The strings of Mlllard Sanders,
John Blue, WilHam Cecil, Grant Lapham.
Dr. Boucher, Det Bigelow, C. E. Clark.
W. G. Durfee, James Thompson and oth
ers will keep California's reputation as a
horse-breeding locality well to the front
throughout the Eastern country this year.
It must no* be inferred, however, that
there is not plenty of good trotting and
pacing material left at home. When the
circuit opens at the breeders' meeting at
Sacramento th<s stalls will be filled, and
among the reinsmen that will be seen in
the sulky will be Ed Lafferty. Vet Tryon.

and 2:10 pacers to come to the front than
there has ever been before In the history

The entry list for the Fourth of- July
championship regatta on Lake Merrltt
closes on Monday next at 8 p. m. at the
Olympic Club, where the regatta com
mittee of the Pacific Association will meet
to complete arrangements. There will be
entries in every event, though in one or
two there may not be the three starters
necessary for the award of the second
prize.
The race for the senior outrigged skiff
championship will be between John Lewis.
, of the Alameda Boat Club and George
Baker of the Dolphin Club, these two
clubs being the only ones owning new
light racing skiffs. John Lewis in a trial
of speed on Sunday on Oakland Creek
beat Fred Ayers by about seven seconds,
and so became entitled to represent his
club. Both the Lewis boys are rowing
in the Alameda senior barge crew, though
it is said that they are not amiteurs, hav
ing built boats to sell, repaired boats for
hire and made a set of barge oars for
the Alameda Boat Club. One of the broth
ers has also been a boat keeper. It is not
likely, however, that the charge of pro
fessionalism will be raised against them.
The four of the University of California
has had more practice together than any
of the crews and, now that they have se
cured the use of the Pioneer barge,
should be able to make a good race over
a short course on smooth water. W. B.
Goodwin, who has been coaching the
Berkeley crew, has had a skiff fitted with
a forty-inch slide on a level with the gun
wale and having hinged foot rests which
go under the seat when the sculler is for
ward. S. J. Pembroke, the veteran Ala
meda oarsman, says that he is willing to
give Goodwin a minute and a half start
over a mile and a half, Pembroke to pull
in a new boat that Rogers is building for
him and Goodwin to use his patent skin".
S. J. Pembroke also says that he is will
ing to row against W. O. Patch, the Dol
phin-man pulling the new skiff built by
Davy of Massachusetts. With regard to
the Dolphin skin*. George Baker says that
she behaves beautifully In smooth water,
but ir. rough water buries her nose and
fills. George Baker has great confidence
in the skiff over the Lake Merritt course.
If the new Rogers skiff is ready a few
days before the Fourth, S. J. Pembroke
will enter the senior outrigged skiff race.
It is unlikely that there will be more
than two or three entries in this event,
as it is considered useless to enter the old
heavy skiffs against the new Dolphin and
Alameda craft. In order, to induce more
contestants to enter it has been suggested
that the outrigged skiff races should be
rowed in heats. -
Alex W. Pape is at Tony Kendall's
boathouse on Lake Merritt, practicing
dally for: the senior shell race. -He will
use his Rogers shell and is likely to re
tain his title as senior shell champion.
Jack Lewis of the Alameda Boat Club
pu!ls from the Alameda boathouse to the
lighthouse and back daily, a distance- of
about ten miles. In the light Rogers skiff
he will be hard to beat. W. G. Hansen,
junior skiff champion of the Alameda
Beat Club, will make a strong bid for the
junior skiff championship of the bay.
The Dolphin four is practicing in the
evenings under the coaching of T. J. Ken
nedy, but the rough water off North
Beach somewhat interferes with their
work. One night they shipped so much
water that they expected to have to swim
to the shore, but contrived by bailing the
beat to keep her afloat. The South End
boathouse is the headquarters of the oars
men in that part of the city, both the
Ariel and Pioneer representatives having
availed themselves of the courtesy of the
South Ends. The South End Junior and
senior barge crews had a race on Sunday
over the Long Wharf course, the seniors
winning easily. The Juniors rowed in the
old barge. South. -End and- received a
handicap of Â» thirty : seconds, the seniors
rowing in the new racing barge. The Pio
neers, who won tho senior barge cham
pienship last year.- will have no barge
crew- this year, the only representative
from the old club being J. Murphy in the
Junfoj skiff race. â¢
The Alameda Boat Club has great hopes
of capturing air the barge races and one
or both of the skiff races. There was at
lone time some talk of. Alex Pape rowing

REGATTA FOR
THE OARSMEN
Th*R first annual open tournament for the
gentlemen's singles championship of Cal
ifornia will be held at the Hotel Rafael.
San Rafael, July 2, 3 and 4. The tourna
ment is under the auspices of the United
Statts Lawn Tennis Association, directed
by the Pacific States Lawn Tennis Asso
ciation. There, will be six prizes offered,
four for those reaching the semi-finals
and two consolation prizes.
As usual, a great many of the entries
will be from the California Tennis Club
of this city. This organization will be
represented by George Whitney, R. N.
Whitney, Sumner Hardy, Grant Smith,
W. B. Collier, Merle Johnson, J. D. Mac-
Gavin. Chet Smith. Dr. Lane, James A.
Code and Charles Kuehn. Other new men
who will enter are: Charles Elston, cham
pion of Hawaiian Islands; Fred Brown of
Oakland. John Craig of Woodland, Ogden
and Jack Hoffman of San Rafael, and
Paul Jones, Du Val Moore and Orville
Pratt of Mill Valley.
George Whitney is naturally picked for
first place, but with Sumner Hardy and
Bob Whitney entered, the champion will
have to be at his best to win. Bob Whiu
ney has been surprising everybody of late
by the game he is putting up. He plays
a remarkable game for one set. but he
seems not to be able to last longer than
one. Sumner Hardy is in rather poor
form, but may pick up before the tourna
ment commences. Grant Smith and W.
B. Collier, with good drawings, should be
well up near the finals. Drummond Mac-
Gavin has been practicing hard of late and
at present is playing a very strong game.
The defeat of Gecrge Whitney at the
hands of Grant Smith last Wednesday
came as a great surprise. The latter
played a very strong game, his volleying
being particularly good, while Whitney
seemed somewhat off in his play.
W. B. Collier has arranged an invita
tion singles tournament for the eight best
men in the California Tennis Club, next to
the Whitneys and Sumner Hardy. The
men invited to play are Collier. Cornell,
Crowell. Johnson, Haight, MacGavin.
: ""'â¢hell and Grant Smith. The entrance
fee it. to be Jo, first prize valued at 520, sec
ond at $12 50 and third J7 50. The event
Is to be completed in one week, four
matches being played every other day and
the order of the matches to be deter
mined by drawing lots. An affair of this
kind would be a cinch for Grant Smith and
Collier.
The tournaments to be held In the early
part of September will be the biggest
events in tennis pulled off in many years.
The idea is to play three, and possibly
four, tournaments in one week. The events
'will consist of men's singles and doubles
tournament, ladies' singles, and possibly
a mixed doubles. Cracks from all parts
of the coast will be on hand for these
events, and the results will be the best
tennis ever played on the coast. The
tracks from Oregon and Washington and
Southern California have promised to par
ticipate, and consequently the entry list
will be vpry large. â
Grant Smith. Drummond MacGavin and
Roy Cornell will probably go to Southern
California in August to play for the
championship of the south.

ing other swimmers much older than him
self .during the past two years. . These
races will take place on Friday and Sat
urday afternoon of next week, during the
Fourth of July celebration, which., is
planned on a big scale by San Diego and
Coronado.
The race of Friday afternoon will be aÂ£
Glorietta Bay, on the Coronado side of
the harbor, and the distance will be a
half-mile straightaway. The race of Sat
urday afternoon will be over a- mile course
in the open bay, with the finish in front
of the 'grand stand on the Commercial
wharf. Both Stolle and Kyle are training
conscientiously, and while. Stolle has the
advantage of six or seven years in. age,
young Kyle has been trained in the water
since he was able to walk on the land.
Both events are for the championship
of the State.
To-morrow the first match of this sea
son between teams representing Young
America and Old England will be played
on the ground at Webster street, Alameda.
Owing to the withdrawal of the British
member of the Alameda- Club, there has
been some littles difficulty in making up
a strong team to represent Old England,
but : eleven of the following ought to give
a good ' account of themselves: John
Myers, C. P. Coles,. E. G. Sloman, A. O.
Sheath, II. C.CasIdy, H. H. Cookson, F.
Bennion, J. J.' Theobald. A. W. Wilding.
E. T.. Langdale, W. Petherick and T. J.
A. TIedemann. The following will prob
ably be tho representatives of Young
America: F. J. Croll (captain), F. Stahl,
W. G. Fortmann, B. Bird, A. Willis, W.
Richter, J.- Brown. C. Orr, R, Hamilton,
J. Guild and H. Bird.
Tho victory recently won by tho Burns
Valley cricketers in their match against
the Lakeport Club was due to the splon
dld batting of H. V. Keeling, who went In
first with A. W. Johnson and carried his
bat for 12(i runs. II. C. Spurr, 19, and H.
S. Rose, 16, wero the only two battimen
who gave Keeling any support. Rose
keeping his wicket up for nearly an hour.
Keellng'B Is Aho flrBt century scored In
Lnko County. II. C. Spurr bowled well,
taking five wickets for fourteen runs, nnd
promises to fill the gap caused by Rosa's
retirement as a bowler. Both clubs seem
to be strong this year, and the matches
between them are being looked forward to
with interest. ' .â¢â¢.Â» " ;. Â¦ \u ; T\ ."/,'<

TO PLAY THE
FIRST MATCH
UNDER the auspices of the Twen
tieth Century Club two fights
wore held at tho Mechnnlcn' Pa
vilion last night. And thoy worn
lightsâ real milk, without tho con
taminating water. So tho crowd thought
ovory Inch of tho wny nnd hpodwI su
premely happy until Referee Wand ren
dered his declKlons. Then tho hlBHlnft 'imil
tho hooting and the Jeering began. It wdÂ»
"Kill him!" and nil thnt sort of thing, for
In each caso tho short-endor was mado tho
loner. . ,'"-*. j'v : , '. .'
Aftor twenty rounds of earnest and
seemingly sincere fighting ,Tlm Callnlian
wits adjudged tho winner over Joe Bern-,
â¢tfiln. Tho Carter-Root fight did not.go
tho limit. In tho fifteenth round Root,
with all tho looks of a winner written on
hlo faco and body, received something.un
expected from Carter's left hand. Tho
blow caught Root full tilt upon tho stom
ach and Root fell upon his knees, agony,
physical misery and grinding pain taking
hold of all hla features. Then Carter In
his eagerness mado a crucial mistake. He
hit Root on the Jawâ a' useless thing to do
under tfie. circumstances, for Root was In
the far-away land where tho sun never
shines and the Btars always glitter. Tho
body punching was more than Root could
stand and Carter had him whipped, al
though' a short time before this Carter
was wobbling about like an ill-regulated
and eccentria pendulum. In the thirteenth
round Carter stock could be had for a
song an,d a poor song at that. Two rounds
later Carter put Root out of the fight.
â¢ Then Wand gave the decision to Root as
he lay on the floor of the ring writhing,
moaning and holding his stomach with
both hands. From the four. sides of the
meager audience came a. sibilant disap
proval that afterward amounted to some
thing more important. .
The crowd gathered around the ring and
the police, were called in to "keep it mov
ing." When Root left the ring, which was
very soon after he was packed to his cor
ner, the crowd did some more hissing.
Nothing but cheers greeted Carter's de
parture from the scene of fistic activity.
What Wand received was not a Joyous
ovation. '. â¢ , ' /
It was a very small crowd that attended
these fights, which were easily the best of
the; present year. For fourteen rounds
Root and Carter fought like demons, the
former bringing into play all his clever
ness, science and. skill, the latter boring
away with a strenuous persistency and
ever swinging his fierce right and left for
head or body. Root -fought like a fast,
clean boxer, shifty and yet a forceful
hitter. Carter went at it hammer and
tongs and .he landed enough times on
Rqot's body- to take all the heart out of
the clever Chlcagoan. Though his face
fcore all the outward evidences of a pulp
like, churning, Carter fought on in true
gameness. '"This he possesses In overflow
ing- quantities and it .won him the fight
last nightâ along with the body tattoo
played upon Root's ribs and stomach.
These fierce blows of Carter were not to
Root's liking and when the most vicious
of them. all came stomachward the game

buildings. Tho French and Herman flag*
are intertwined over the gate of the bar
rucks of the crack guard corps, whtr*
somÂ« of tho competing uuto cur* will bo

The- entire city of Berlin Is agog with,
excitement about the race. Tho contest
ants tiro duo here to-morrow. Huts arÂ«
freely made on tho winner, and M. Four
nier Is the favorite. The police ot Berlin
are to-night mailing extensive prepara
tions to hiindlo tho Immense crowds who
will wltncsa the finish of the contest and
to avoid collision* and accidents. There)
are thousands of visitors In Berlin from
outside points and two extra trains havÂ«
arrived from Paris, bringing those Inter
ested in the event.
A succession of minor accidents marked
the middle stage of the race. A petroleum
motor blew up while approaching Dusael
dorf- and its occupants were slightly In
jured. Count de Perlgord, the fourth
racer to arrive at Alx la Chapelle. was so>
seriously ill from the strain that he has
been compelled to abandon the contest.
AIX LA CHAPELLE, June 2S.-Sev
enty-three motor cars completed the first
stage of the automobile race between
Paris and Berlin yesterday and started
again at a o'clock this morning for Han
over, 276 miles distant. The racers started
from here in the same order in which they
arrived. â¢ -..â¢
HANOVER, Prussia,' June 23.â Fournier
was again first to arrive at the end here
of the day.'s stage of the motor race. De

-The weather was brilliant here to-day
and thousands assembled to witness tho
arrival cf contesting motor cars. When.
M. Fournier drove into the city at a high
rate of speed the band struck up the
Marseillaise" and the winner of the AIx
la Chapelle-Hanover event - was vocifer
ously cheered. The arrival of M. de

was also heartily cheered. The competi

was over and all the referee had to do
was to count ten. Carter did a ITMle more
and the referee gave the knocked-out man
thwdecMon.
The thirteenth round was the most ex
cltlngfiir tho Huht. Soon after tho gong
Hounded that brought the men together
Hoot found tho vulnerable point of Car
ter's chin and down went Carter. He re
mained on tho floor for nlno seconds, but
thÂ«n wÂ«nt at It again, recovering sutll
cltmtly to stay with the gume. Another
left-hand punch found its way toward
Carter's head and again he fell to the ring
floor, clinging to tho lnst count before he
wan on hln foot. Root evidently did not
like Carter's gamencsH, so he dropped on
IiIh kiw-r'H, claiming a foul after the bnttlo
hud been continued a very short time. The
rofcreo heedfd him not a whit, Â»o 'Root
gotÂ° up and fought, and when the round
was finished both men were hammering
away In unremitting fashion. In the four
teenth Carter was visibly weak and worn
and Hoot advanced step by step toward
the consummation of his night's labors.
In the fifteenth Carter showed a wonder
ful recuperation and he won by gameness
and a body blow that Root did not want
to see or feel duplicated. But the decision
makes him the loser, and in the histories
Root's name will be Inscribed as the vic
tor; â¢ .
All went smoothly,* happily and satis
factorily in the Bcrnstein-Callahan fight
until at the end of the twentieth round
tho referee threw his finger at Callahan,
which meant that he was the winner.
Tho crowd thought otherwise, so Wand
was generally condemned.
This fight was unexpectedly close and
interesting. Callahan, a good, clean hit
ter with a dangerous right, proved himself
the better man of the two. although
Bernstein's work was aggressive and con
sistently performed. He landed with his
left repeatedly, cutting up Callahan's
face and giving him a few facial remind
ers that were in keeping with his pugil
istic occupation. But despite Bernstein's
aggressiveness. Callahan used a right
cross on a few occasions that put Bern
stein on his haunches and made, his back
ers reach to tear up tickets. In the
eighth round Bernstein was brought to
earth for the first time, but* when the
round was over he was on his feet fight
ing strong and gamely.' â¢
After this Callahan took Bernstein's
punches and waited to swing In his right.
In the eighth round there was a fierce ral
ly. â¢ which ended ,only when the gong
sounded. Both men were in bitter earnest
and the crowd cheered them for their
work. Two, rounds later that wicked
right again found a resting place on
Bernstein's .chin, and eight seconds were
counted before he was on his feet.. Re
covering, he. fought the round out to a
good close. ' . -
And so these two feather-weights fought
their fight, always eager ' and always
earnest. In the thirteenth Bernstein had
things pretty much his own way after
administering a sharp rebuke with his
left on Callahan's chin, but took no ad
vantage of Callahan's temporory discom
fiture. Bernstein might have done better
if he ' had used his right occasionally.
During the entire battle he used his left
almost entirely. As a conclusion these
figlrters .let loose in a hotly sustained
rally. "Wand "fancied" Callahan; the
crowd wanted it a -draw.

YACHTING NEWS
OF THREE CLUBS
To-day and to-morrow are open dates
on the schedules of the three yacht clubs.
But. as the tide begins to flood at 3:10 this
afternoon and runs out till 3:52 p. m to
morrow,* many of the yachtsmen wla
doubtless cruise this evening to various 1
points on the upper bay, returning to
morrow.
Several of the yachts failed to reach the
rendezvous at Mare Island last Saturday
because they were becalmed In Richard
sons Bay or above Raccoon Straits. The
sloops Nixie and Genesta arrived at Val
lejo about 8 p. m., and the yawl Royal a
few minutes later. The schooner Wave
did not get up to Vallejo till nearly mid
night, and the sloop Thetis came to an
chor about 2:30 on Sunday morning. Most
of the yachts got under way shortly after
& o'clock on Sunday morning, though the
sloop Nixie, the schooner Chispa and the
yawl Royal did not make a start till two
hours later. The schooner and the yawl.
In company with many of the San Fran
cisco and Corinthian yachts, were be
calmed off California City, and wero
towed to their moorings by the launches
Crescie, Envoy, etc.
The San Francisco Yacht Club will lose
Its measurer In a few days, as H. O. Toll
is going to Chicago to reside. There la no
longer any doubt about a race for the
Perpetual Challenge Cup, a challenge
having been received by the secretary of
the Corinthian Yacht Club. It was
first sent by the Vallejo Yacht Club
to Orlo Eastwood, secretary of the Paclflo
Interclub Yacht Association, and. was re
turned by him with the information that
E. Brickell Is tho proper person to be ad
dressed. Believing that a challenge would
be at once sent to the Corinthians, the
San Francisco syndicate decided to post
pone building from their Crownlnahield
plans until late in the year or early In
1902. The challenge has now been sent in
the proper form to Secretary Brickell and
will certainly be accepted.
A. E. Chapman's sloop Helen cruised
down to Tlburon last Saturday, and had a
brush with the Corinthian sloops Aeolus
and Truant, both winners of Macdonoush
cups.
A new mainsail and a single Jib bav*
been ordered for tho sloop Royal, as one
of the two Jibs was torn In last Satur
day's cruise and had to be patched up to
complete the trip.
As the Fourth falls this year on, a Thurs
day, it does not offer an opportunity for a
prolonged cruise. July 4, 6, 6 and 7 are open
on all the programmes except that of the
California Yacht Club, which holds the
annual race for the Wallace trophy on
the Fourth. Vice Commodore B. F. Sa
gar's sloop Edna at present holds the cup,
but it is thought that John T. Carrier's
nloop Jesnle E will be a dangerous com
petitor. The sloops Pactolus and Thelma
will also enter, but the sloop Oenesta,
formerly owned by ex-Commodore E. N.
Walter and named Embla. Is now on the
roll of the Corinthian Yneht Club. JÂ«sstÂ«
E, after winning the class flag 1aÂ«t year,
was beaten in the Wallace trophy race,
her owner having changed her sail-plan
in the hope of increasing her *peÂ«d. Tnla
season he has restored her to her former
trim, mid haÂ« high hopes of winning the

cipal event of the Woman's National
Championship tennis tournament to-day
was the final round between Miss Marlon
Jones of Nevada and Miss Bessie Moore
of Ridgewood, N. J.. in which the latter
came out the victor. In the first two sets
Miss Jones played by far the stronger
pame and in spite of the swift and well
f)!aced drives of her opponent kept a good
ength ahead and allowed Miss Moore only
five games in the two sets. The third and
fourth sets, which went to Miss Moore,
were more evenly contested. In the fifth
and deciding set It repeatedly seemed as
though Miss Jones would have to default,
as she appeared to be almost exhausted
from the heat. Miss Moore kept up her
strong- game ana" won the set, 6-3, and the
match, three sets to two.
In the men's singles. J.-W. Clothier, the

SENATOR ELKINS of West Virginia has re
cently expressed the conviction that at the next
Congressional elections the Republicans will
make large gains in Alabama, -Tennessee, Georgia,
Louisiana, North ' Carolina and in parts of South
Carolina and Florida. . He expects these gains because
as he says: "The people of the South now appre
ciate the practical fact that business is business; sen
timent is giving away to business enterprise and busi
ness success."
The Senator went on to point out that the South
has remarkable resources for the development of all
sorts of manufacturing industries, and that the eyes
of the more intelligent have become opened to the
fact. Those men are. now bending their efforts to
profit by their 'advantages and by the favorable condi
tions established by the Republican policies of sound
money and protection. In the course of their efforts
they have been brought into conflict with the Bour
bon conservatives of -Democracy on the one side and
the Bryanite radicals on the other,, and will there
fore be forced to support the Republican party as the
only means of bringing prosperity to their section
as well as to the rest of the Union.. â¢ . 'y ;;<
A different view of the situation is> taken by Sena
tor McLaurin of South Carolina^ who holds that the
new movement now going on in the South is essentially
a Democratic movement;' that, it does not imply a
drift toward Republicanism, butla revival of the poli
cies which were advocated by Democrats of old. In
a recent interview he said: "In' the speeches I. have
made on the subsidizing of our. merchant marine I
have called attention to the fact that the first subsidy
granted by this Government was:granted by a Demo
cratic administration in 1845 to the Collins line. It
was not a success, because the subsidy was not large
enough, but it was the same in principle. There is a
good Democratic argument. The Republicans have
simply stolen our platform. Are the Democrats
going. to allow -themselves to bV crowded off their
own platform by the .opposition;; party? I do not
think so'. Expansion was always a .Democratic
polity." â¢ -Â¦- v'.v.vV'. , '
Referring to the rapidity with 1 which the Southern
people are coming back to; the" principles and policies
<ff the old-time Democracy, and are growing, in "favor,
of all legislation designed to build up American indus
try, he said: VWhen I address ah: audience in my
own State on the matter of subsidies I recall to them
that all of the industrial enterprises that have -been
started in their country were subsidized. They know
that this was done and they know the benefits that
have come from these enterprises. The people of the
South are not to be frightened by the talk of danger in
subsidies. They- know all about Ihem. -..There 'is. no
sectionof the country that will be-more benefited b"y
a great merchant marine than the South: i", The "cotton
REPUBLICANISM IN THE SOUTH.
TRANS-SIJ3ERIAN TRAVEL.
[ '. ; : â . Â¦ Â¦ . â¢ Â¦ â¢Â¦
, a .CCORDING to the Paris Herald, travel across
â¢/V Siberia- by. the new railroad is, to be. rendered
â¢* *- about as sumptuous as modern luxury can desire.
An organization known as the "Compagnie Interna
tionale des Wagon-Lits" has arranged to run once a
week what, is called a .."train de luxe" from Moscow
to. Irkoutsk in eight days, and.it is' announced that by
September the traveler will be able to make an un
broken journey from Moscow to the banks of the
Amur, except for- the crossing of Lake Baikal, by
these trains in about ten days.
A description of the,trains de luxe says they consist
of one first class sleeping. carriage, two second class
sleeping carriages, .a drawing-room and restaurant
carriage, and a wagon containing bathroom, with
shower, etc., a hairdresser's establishment,' a gymna
sium, and a compartment guarded by the head con
ductor and containing a number of fire and burglar
proof safes. ,The keys are given to passengers having
jewels or valuable documents which they desire to
place in security. The carriages are fitted up with
every device that can add to the comfort of the trav
eler. Each compartment contains two places with an
adjoining lavatory.
We are given the further information that the cars
are lighted by electricity, they contain a well-stocked
library and a. piano, and the conductors can each of
them speak several languages: The time table for the
route at the present time is thus given: Paris to Mos
cow, two days; .^ Moscow to Irkoutsk, eight days;
thence to Strelensk, three days; the descent of the
Amur to Khabarovski, six- days; from that point by
rail to Vladivostok, one day; thence by, steamer to
Nagasaki â¢ two 'days^rqaking ; r the , trip 'from j P.aris : to
Japan within twe'nty'-tvvb days. ' ; -The only uncertain
element in the time table is the descent of the Amur.
It is added. that; the Compagnie Internationale is
seeking railroad connections in. China, and that it may
soon be ' possible to travel from London to Peking
in fifteen days at a cost not to exceed $300.
r The arrangements for the comforts of travelers along
the route are npt to be confined to trains de luxe.' It
is announced that by 1903, when the. road will be vir
tually completed between Moscow "and Port; Arthur,
there will have been established a series of Hotels at
various ppints along the route at which travelers can
break their journey -and rest under surroundings as
comfortable as any to be found in; Europe! The se^
ries is to include a grand hotel at Peking, the site
for .which has been already purchased. Â¦' Â¦.-.,Â¦
In : these j. promises' there. may.- be s something; of
exaggeration,! but' th^y none the less' serve to show
that the trans-Siberian route is "soon to -be the
speediest and most comfortable way of making the
trip around the. globe; In fact, if the performance
comes anywhere near keeping up with the prospectus,
the Siberian ride wiir be' a pleasure trip in every sense
of the word; and Californians^wishing ' to- visit Paris
will go by the ; way of Vladivostok,' instead of New
York. , ;Â¦ " ;; :'::, :v :^. : -&*Â£ ';:>Â¦: â¢ .: :
THIS is the period of great undertakings, in
which are used the latest findings of science
and experience. There are several schemes on
hand for the building of model cities. It is safe to
say that in such work the results of experience will
not cut much figure. There have been several model
cities founded in this country. The town of Grinnell,
Iowa, 'was laid off in lots and sold by its founder,
each deed containing a clause that forfeited title if 'liq
uors were sold on the premises. That Was supposed to
constitute a model town forty 3'ears ago, but Grin
nell began with prohibition and ended with Rev.
George D. Herron as a professor in its model col
lege.
The town of Greeley, Colo., began with the same
sort of prohibition, but is now known more for its
fine potatoes than its sobriety.
A model town physically may be only a moderate
town morally.
In its physical features a model town may be made'
or one already built may be transformed. The drain
age and streets of a city are subjects of primary im
portance. A model city will have its streets exca
vated to the lot line, and arched over, furnishing a
wide underground conduit for- carrying all sewer,
water and gas pipes, and electric wires. In such a
town there will not be an overhead trolley, telephone
or telegraph wire. The streets will be of the best
material on the arch as the best foundation. Where
the grades require it they will furnish proper footing
for teams. Such streets will deliver their surface
drainage into the pipes provided therefor in the wide
conduit beneath, and this will not be permitted to
mix with the sewage. The sewage will be converted
into "sludge," for a fertilizer, and its fluid parts will
be so chemically cleansed in the process that they
will not pollute the salt or fresh water into which
they are finally delivered. The dry and wet garbage
which constitutes city waste will be used economically
i"- making caustic soda and potash, fertilizers and
tiwn-absorbent brick. A common red brick absorbs
its weight in water and makes a damp wall. It is al
ready proved by works on a large scale in England
that of city waste a brick of fine appearance, and non
absorbent, can be made as cheaply as the red brick.
Now with such streets, conduits and care of the
noxious and innocuous waste of a crowded popula
tion, and with everything that disfigures below and
all that transfigures above ground, why will it not be
a model city? v '
Add parks and consistency and variety of architec
ture, and such a city would draw people from all over
the world. If the plan were cranky it would be at
tractive. If it proposed some statutory enforcement
of morals, manners or religion it would have a vogue.
Yes, if it let these objects of proper concern of gov
ernment go as they are now, slipshod and frazzled,
and proposed government ownership of utilities. that
are now better administered than they can be by
Government, the politicians would buzz-saw the air
in advocating it.
What it would do in this beginning, for all time, is
being done piecemeal and ineffectually and at as great
cost Streets are being dug up and then shabbily re
paired again to put down little conduits for electric
wires and to lay or repair water, gas or sewer pipes.
The surface drainage is bad, and a heavy rain floods
cellars, destroys property and by basement damp
imperils health.
All of this might be provided for in a roomy and
dry underground street, for the use of which private
corporations could be made to pay rent. It would
be lighted *by electricity and ventilated.
Ancient cities had catacombs under their streets,
and there stowed away their dead. Instead of death
this model city would have life below *its pavements.
How many millions would excavate the streets of

MODEL CITIES.
IT IS not often that a man risks his life in the cause of
science, says a writer in the New York Sun. As a rule, no
one, would receive much praise for doing so, though there
are occasions when such an act is most. heroic and laud-
\ able. Perhaps there are not many to applaud the achieve
ment of Professor Matteucci, the distinguished Italian geolo
gist, who lived on the edge of the crater of Vesuvius for three
days last year." But all's well that ends well; and he escaped
with a whole skin.
The volcano resumed a very active phase nearly^flve years
before Professor MatteuccI went into camp on the outer edge
of the scene of disturbance. Vesuvius be^gan a new eruptive
period on July 3, 1895; ebullitions of greater, or less magnitude,
accompanied by a\ considerable flow of lava, were of frequent
occurrence' for about fif.ty months. At last, on September 1,
1899, the lava ceased to flow through the lateral fissure by which
it had escaped from the crater. At that time the; bottom of
the crater was 700 feet below the lowest part of Its rim.
r[ '.Fresh : supplies of lava began slowly to fill up the crater
again." On April 24, last year, the surface of the lava was
within about 260 feet of the crater edge. On that day another
period of violent activity began, lasting for an entire month.
No lava was discharged down the mountain side but some of
the explosions in the crater were terrific, particularly between
May 4 and 11, reaching a maximum on May 9. The noise of
the explosions was distinctly heard throughout a large part
of the Campagna. The Italian professor watched all the phe
nomena from the slope of the mountain and spent May 11, 12
and 13 at the crater's edse. , . . ,
It Is well known that the eruptions since the seventeenth
Century have greatly altered the contour of the mountain, and
that its central vent or crater has undergone, many, changes.
During the period of Professor' Matteucci's observations the
crater was enlarged in one of Its diameters about twenty feet.
It. measured at the top 164 metres, about 540 feet across from
northeast to southwest and 180 metres from east to west. The
flames produced by the sulphurous ; vapors were abundant;

many projectiles were hurled into the air, the highest altitude
attained being about 1800 feet above the bottom of the crater.
On May 9 the professor observed a block of unusual size
rising above the top of the crater. He happened to have his
watch in hand 'and found that the projectile was in the air
above Vesuvius seventeen seconds before It reached terra flrma.
on the slope of the mountain. He ascertained later that it
measured about twelve cubic metres and that its weight was
approximately thirty tons. "When it reached the earth it was
traveling at the rate of about three hundred feet a second.
It has been estimated that the force which propelled this mass
of rock high into the air was equal to 607.995 horsepower. The
volume of the solid material which was ejected from the crater
during the explosive period of April and May is estimated at
about 500,000 cubic metres; and In that time about thirty feet
were added to the altitude of the mountain.
It may.be- imagined that it was not extremely .pleasant to
linger in the immediate neighborhood of these' terrific occur
rences, but the daring man of science held his ground and did
not take bis departure until he had completed the observations
he had in view. The. wonder is that he was not killed. On the
last day of his sojourn upon the top of the mountain a period
of Intense violence succeeded a few hours of comparative calm.
The explosions In the crater were of great frequency, and the
geologist had the hardihood to see everything that was going
on. One extraordinary explosion caused a rain of fragments all
around him. 'Myriads of small bits of rock and red hot frag
ments of scoriae fell all around. Nobody knows how he had
the good ' luck to escape, for his entire outfit of baggage â¢ was
destroyed excepting his camera. This instrument and its
owner "were all that escaped without a scratch.
The professor says that the spectacle of that boiling caul
dron of lava was a marvelous one. He has not. however,
undertaken to describe it, though he has written at length
upon the scientific aspect of the phenomena he observed, and
has made a special study of the nature of the materials that
were ejected from the crater.

OUR ALABAMA VISITORS.
ONE of the ladies visiting California -with the
"Alabama Press Association expressed her
gratification with the hospitality of the city
by saying, "You all are just like our people in Ala
bama." That is of course the highest praise an Ala

We are indeed like one' another. That is the chief
glory and surest safeguard of our republic. We are
a homogeneous people. We can never be divided.
Wide as is the extent" of our domain and scattered
as our people are through every variety of climate
known to the temperate zone, none the less, whether
from Maine or Florida, Minnesota or Texas, we are all
alike in our Americanism, ahd the welcome of Cali
fornia for each and all is of such a nature as to make
them feel in very truth that they are at home
and among their own people.
In the universal dominance of genuine Americanism
there is nothing of a dull" uniformity. Like every
other people on earth, we are subject to the influences
of sun and soil, and to conditions of society in which
we are brought up. As a consequence there is just
enough of variety in the people of different sections
to make them mutually attractive to one another. It
is' not for nothing that we speak of "New England
culture," "Southern courtesy" and "Western vigor."
These ' phrases signify Â¦ certain characteristics of the
people of the different sections, which distinguish the
one from the other and enable an observer to tell
almost instantly from what section of the Union any
individual hails. *
Our Alabama visitors, representing thebe'st types of
Southern society, have conferred as much pleasure as
they have received. It has been a genuine'happiness
to be the hosts of so gracious a company pf courteous
men. and charming women. They will carry back to

THE Brooklyn Eagle of June 9 devotes a page
Â¦to a rehash of the Examiner and Journal scares
over bubonic plagueyin San Francisco. The
writer signs himself "Mul," and the best evidence of
his disbelief of the story is his refusal to sign it with
his true name. \
He begins with a statement of thirty deaths alleged
to be due to the plague, and occurring in the period
March 6, 1900, to February 12, 1901. His descrip
tion of the first case may do for all: "Name, Wing
Chut King, aged 41 years. He stated to Wing Ging,
his brother, that he had been sick six months." After
treatment of a swollen gland in the groin this tough
Celestial; survived a month longer. If the plague of
lies and liars would only quit after a seven- months'
run, like this famous. slow coach case of Wing Chiit
King, California vfjpuld rejoice. . , : â¢ - '
Mr. "Mill" then proceeds to a lurid description of'
Chinatown, which is characterized as "the foulest
spot on the American continent." He finds cause of
offense in the personal appearance of the idols in the
josshouse and the elocution of the actors in the Chi
nese theaters^ the "radishes a foot long" in the
stores, and the eight padlocks on the safe of the
Big Jim restaurant. All these adjuncts to the tale
are called in to reinforce the case of tough old Wing
Chut King; who, according to this therapeutic pundit,
stood off the plague for seven months and died of one
small bubo at last: Mul found "the prevalence of the
plague in this -dank, dark breeding place of pesti
lence, where San Francisco has .permitted human
beings to live in dens and underground burrows un
fit for beasts, in the midst of unsanitary conditions a
faithful description of which would give a rough turn
to a sensitive stomach. Indescribable filth! Reeking
atmospheres! Sickening squalor! Rotten, tumble
down buildings, even their foul, slimy cellars, way
underground, the habitat of humanity. Beyond all
question a breeding place for pestilence!" Then,
pray, why didn't it breed? This nimble falsifier de
feats his own purpose and spits in his own face and
calls himself a liar. . Granting the foul condition of
Chinatown, and its continuance unpurged during the
entire year in which the thirty alleged cases occurred,
does not. this son of Ananias see that if the plague
had been here under conditions so favorable to its
spread among the 30,000 Chinese in that quarter, in
stead of the thirty alleged cases there would have been
thousands?
California offers as the best evidence Of non
existence of the pestilence -the very conditions de
scribed by this vagabond compiler. Not content with
separating his premise of filth from his conclusion of
pestilence, this fellow represents the State authorities
as put under Federal compulsion to clean Chinatown.
This is a palpable falsehood. The Governor of Cali
fornia and the local authorities entered upon that
work with energy and have prosecuted it with suc
cess. The only news from the Federal authorities' has
been a false report of a plague. case in April, which
turned out to be not plague at all, and which those
highly praised officials refused to correct after admit
ting they were wrong."
The S.tate authorities have watched this attack upon
California with great solicitude. They have seen the
selection of intimates of Dr. Kinyoun and medical
favorites of rival overland roads put on Federal inves
tigating commissions, to find facts to fit the plague
theory of .our detractors and rivals. We have seen so
called "experts" sent here* who never. saw a case of
bubonic plague, dead or alive. And all this we have
endured with a degree of patience. But when a sheet
published in Greater New York, in the same issue in
which it editorially announces that the very water in
that city is so foul that a man dropped dead imme
diately after drinking- a glass of it, devotes a page to
slander of us, -we resent it. It has not even the ex
cuse of news enterprise, for the whole subject is as
stale as the seven-months-old bubo of Wing Chut
King. We resent being lectured and lied about by a
newspaper that is circulated in the tenement quarters
of the East Side, where children are born rotten and
where the moral and physical filth is so sodden and
dense, that beside it Chinatown seems like the Elysian
fields or the garden of Calypso.

SEEKS TO RESTRAIN WAITERS.
The action instituted by Mathias John
son to restrain the Cooks' and Waiters*
Union from Interfering with the conduct
of his Market-street and Montgomery
street restaurants was partly argued be
fore Judge Sloss yesterday.
Attorney William Rix of the firm of
Bishop & "Wheeler appeared for Johnson,
who, it Is understood, occupies the po
sition of plaintiff as the representative of
the Restaurant Keepers' Association. H.
N. Hutton represented the cooks and
waiters.
Mr. Kix raised the point that the al
leged contract entered into between thÂ«
employers and employes was invalid in
that it was in restraint of trade and he
further argued the point that the acts of
the cooks and waiters in 'placing pickets
in front of the establishments of the
plaintiff were illegal and unconstitutional,
disturbed the peace of the plaintiff and
deprived him of his constitutional rights
and privileges as a citizen-
. Hutton on behalf of the cooks and wait
era endeavored to establish his contention
that the Cooks' and "Walters' Union aa a
body were not responsible for the alleged
wrongs from which Johnson was suffer
'ing loss and inconvenience. He said that
the cooks and waiters were only using
such lawful means as in their opinion best
subserved their purposes. The argument
will be concluded to-day.

A ghastly array of barbers' implements
of torture was displayed in the offices.
Razors whose last honing took place years
ago, brushes whose bristles lone since lost
their connection with the handles, bottles
of hair tonic of varying degrees of in
tensity and sea foam shampoos were scat
tered around loose. Strops were not hung
upon the walls so the candidates could
improve their tools and put a razor edge
upon them.
"Handwriting does not count in this ex
amination," said President Calish. "If
we can make out what the men write we
will pass them. We have made arrange
ments for a lot of subjects upon whom to
test the ability of these men in a practical
way. We can send up to the barbers*
headquarters and get any number of men
to operate upon, and if the candidates
cannot finish the job either Fleming,
Drake or myself will do it. No man need
go out of here unshorn."
"What kind of eggs do you prefer for an
egg shampoo; hen or duck eggs?" was a
question propounded by Examiner Drake.
"What is the best hair tonic of which
you know?" was another question. If the
applicant came from this city he gen
erally answered "Callsh's," if from Sac
ramento "Fleming's" and if from Los An
geles "Drake's." One aspirant had the
temerity to answer that his* was the best
in the world. He will not get a certificate.
"In the removal of Galway sluggers
do you leave the chin or the neck ex

As this ancient style of facial adorn
ment is not fashionable at present, many
of the applicants gave confused answers.
Another question that caused rrfore or
less worry was, "What would you-do to
restore hair on a bald scalp?" This
served as a tonic for the tired applicants.
Some answered, "Put on a wig"; others
dissertated upon the advantages of the
"toupee," and still others named various
patent nostrums. The board will meet in

ANATOMY ADDED
TO CURRICULUM
Regents Create a New
Department for State
University.
Take First Step in Plan for
Original Research in
Medicine?
The chair of anatomy, the establishment
of which has been under discussion by the
Regents of the State University for some
Â¦weeks, was created yesterday. Dr. Joseph
Marshal Flint, instructor of anatomy In
the University of Chicago and a graduate
of Johns Hopkins University, was ap
pointed to the professorship, at a salary
of $3000 a year.
The creation of the chair of anatomy
is the result cf a plan which President
w neeler has been working on for some
time. He believes that medicine as a
branch of the sciences has been sadly ne
glected on this coast, and it has been his
desire to gather under the control of the
university a corps of specialists who will
devote their time to original research In
medicine. He announced at the meeting
of the Regents yesterday that it was his
idea to make the chair a purely academic
one, and in no way connected with the
medical college affiliated with the univer
sity as it exists at present. In that connec
tion, which was brought up by a question
from Dr. Ellinwood, President Wheeler
unfolded his plan for an academic depart
ment of the medical branches, such as
pathology, ana'.omy, physiology and the j
others. His is not so much the idea of a I
medical school as it is a plan to have |
medicine treat<.d as a science and handled
in the same manner as the departments
of zoology, botany and similar depart
ments.
There was one dissenting voice when the
motion to establish the chair of anatomy
was put. Dr. ISUinwood said he thought
the establishment of a medical school at
public expense was unprecedented and un
warranted, and he did not believe it would
be approved by the majority of the tax
payers of the State. When it came to a
vote on the proposition he voted "no."
Developing a Medical College.
As at present established the medical
college affiliated with the university is al
most a distinct institution. It supports
itself, and the Regents have no power
over its finances, either to create or to
make good deficiencies. The university
merely supervises the course of study,
eees that it is kept up to the proper
standard and confers the degrees upon its
graduates. If the chair of anatomy be
followed up with others it will gradually
develop into a medical college, absolutely
under the control of the university in
every way and under the direction of men
â¢who will give their whole time to the
work, and not. as Is now the case, make
their duties as professors incidental to
their practice of medicine. !
There has been provided $5000 for the
eupport and equipment of the department
of anatomy, but President Wheeler as
f ured the Regents that the * equipment
would be forthcoming as soon as the de
partment had teen established. It is his
intention to make of the department one
second only, to that of Johns Hopkins
University, which is famous the world
over.
On the recommendation of the president
the Regents filled quite a number of va
cancies in the faculty. President Wheeler
has just returned from the East, where
he went in search of material for his de
partments, and he submitted a list of
names which he said were the pick of all
the available material he had seen in his
journey. His recommendations were all
adopted unanimously by the Regents.
They were as follows:

4. That a copy of this report, accompanied

the same in a position of access to the citizens
for their signature.
5. Â¦ That a copy of this report be submitted
to Â¦ every central labor body throug-hot*K the
Pacific slope and to the American Federation
of Labor, with a request that these bodies take
the necessary action toward recording the
sentiment of their, respective localities.
3. That a cooy of this report be sent to
every labor organization and central body in
the State of California, accompanied by a suf
ficient number of petition blanks.
2. That a copy of this report be submitted
to the press of San Francisco,, with a request
that it be published.
1. That the San Francisco Labor Council
urge the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion
act. with the amendments herein, outlined, by
the ccmine session of Congress.
We believe that the exclusion act should be*
made perpetual in operation, aa a step not
only strictly consistent with *he principle of
the proposed legislation, but also as a means
of settling the question definitely and at once.
In view of these considerations we recom
mend: . .
2. The extension of the exclusion act over
all territory under the jurisdiction of the
United States.
â¢ 3. Providing: that the exclusion act shall re
main In force perpetually.
1. Exclusion of all Asiatic*, and particularly
Japanese, other than the government represen
tatives of these peoples and their personal
staffs. ; . .
We believe that all such laws should be
amended so as to embrace the following par
ticulars: Â¦'-Â¦Â¦"- *
Chinese Exclusion Law.
A lengthy report on the matter of the
continued exclusion of Asiatic labor was
presented by W. Macarthur on behalf of
the law and legislative committee. 'After
referring to the fact that legislation must
be taken by the coming session of. Con
gress, as the present law expires on May
5, 1902, and reviewing the question of Jap
anese labor, the report, which was adopt
ed, makes the following recommendations:
' A proposition to , establish a weekly
newspaper under the auspices of the La
bor Council and in advocacy of the inter
ests of the allied trades unions was re
ceived favorably. If established the jour
nal will be published under the auspices
of the executive committee, from whom
the suggestionNemanated.
A proposition to admit Villa D. Rey
nolds as representative of the Women's
Union Label League provoked much de
bate, but gallantry ilnally triumphed.. The
league comprises nineteen members, who
pledge themselves to see that none but
goods bearing union labels are used.
George Oakes and William O'Brien were
admitted as representatives of the.Var
nishers and Polishers.
Secretary Wisler reported' to the Labor
Council at its meeting last night : ; that
everything was progressing favorably,
and read from a numoer of telegrams re
ports -of concessions of hours. He said,
that out of 105 machine shops in Buffalo,
N. Y., all- but four had acceded to the de
mands for shorter hours. He also named
a large Â¦ number of other Eastern cities
where he claimed similar concessions had
been made.
Reports Are Encouraging.
' The sudden and unannounced visit of
Vice President Wilson, who has only re
cently been in attendance at the late con
vention in Toronto, is of particular sig
nificance at this time. While the reports
received by the machinists through Secre
tary Wisler Indicate a change In the situ
ation in' Eastern States, in rian Francisco
the Metal Trades Association, comprising
all of the- large and most of the small- iron
working plants, have for six weeks failed
to yield to the demands of the strikers.
His mission here is believed to have some
connection with a possible settlement of
the trouble.
j The action commenced by Rausch in the
United States Circuit Court aims at a
complete stoppage of the cooks' and wait
ers' "strike. Processes were issued and
served upon Secretary Rosenberg of the
Labor Council, Business Agent juane of
tne Cooks', and Walters' Alliance and
others demanding their presence before
Judge Morrow next Monday. - An effort to
serve Jeff 1). Pierce, the national organ
izer of labor, was tutile, as he left town,
several aays ago. It is said that he is in
Los Angeies, and if he does not get:be
yond the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court
ne, too, will be served with the process.
It is considered doubtful whether he can
be reached in . time. Bishop, .Wheeler &
Hoelner and T. V. O'Brien are "counsel for
the restaurant-keepers. The. name of the
attorney who will defend the strikers has
not yet been announced.
During the night Fourth Vice President
Wilson of the International Association
of Machinists arrived in the city. " He
found Secretary Wisler of the local
branch at the meeting of the Labor Coun
cil, and after a hurried conference with
him retired to his hotel.
Several important moves were made
yesterday in the field of labor. In the
United States * Circuit Court Judge Mor
row, on the petition of Albert Ra-usch, is
sued an order ordering the men who are
directing the boycott against certain res
taurants Â» to show cause on Monday why
they, should not be restrained from, main
taining "pickets or boycotters in front of
his and other restaurants in the city. At
the same time a similar suit filed by M.
Johnson, president of the Restaurant
keepers' Association, was on argument
before Judge Sloss in the Superior. Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALX. BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, June 28.â Cuba hav
ing accepted the Platt amendment, L-ieu
.tenant General Miles sees no necessity for
the retention of the American troops in
the island. He has officially recommended
to Secretary Root that one-half the force
now policing the island be withdrawn
and that the work done by the troops be
turned over to the Cubans in order, that
they may be prepared to accept the full
responsibility for preserving order when
all the American soldiers are ordered
home.
It is General Miles' belief that such a
etep would settle beyond doubt the capa
city of the Cubans for self-government.
If any disturbances occurred the troops
could promptly reoccupy the island. There
are now less- than five thousand men in
the island. If General Miles' recommend
ation should be adopted not more than,
two thousand would be retained during
the summer and fall. . Â¦ ; â ,- -
Notwithstanding the suggestion by Gen
eral Miles, it is not believed the President
and Secretary Root will deem It advisable
to reduce the American force in Cuba un
til next spring, when the gradual with
drawal of 4 the troops will begin. The mo
ment the Cuban Government assumes
control, that moment the last American
regiment will leave the Island. -
NEXT," called President Calish of
the State Board of Barber Exam
iners to a group of waiting aspi
rants. Every man got up, stood
behind his chair and looked wise.
A grizzled veteran with forty years'
growth of beard walked in and wanted to
get "one of them diplomas." It was the
occasion of the first examinations of bar
bers under the new law passed by the last
Legislature and signed by the Governor
on February 20. The delay of the Gov
ernor in appointing the Board of Exam
iners has somewhat complicated matters.
Nevertheless ten applicants presented
themselves yesterday afternoon and were
put through a civil service course of ex
amination. Ten questions were propound
ed. These touched upon the various
branches of the trade, such as shaving,
shampooing and hair-cutting, and each
question had a distinct bearing upon the
special subject. Â¦
"Sycosis" was a poser for many of the
applicants. Sycosis is" not a nice thing to
have, and how best to prevent it was a
subject of much earnest consideration and
scratching of jowls. Several candidates
passed over the question, although they
were itching to know just what "sycosis"
means. As it is a Greek derivative and
not being familiar with the dead lan
guages some of the embryonic barbers
gave way under the strain.
Just how that word got into the exam
ination questions perhaps President Calish
may be able to explain. He had an inter
view a few days ago with President Wil
liamson of the Board of Health. Dr. Wil
liamson suggested that in addition to
questions about sanitation, hygiene, venti
lation and disinfection this be incor
porated. So every barber that wants to
be up to date and get his diploma from
the State Board of Barber Examiners is

A local lodge of the Knights of the
Royal Arch, a t society which admits
to its membership only saloon and
liquor men, was organized Thursday night
at B'nai B'rith Hall. The new organiza
tion, which has for its object the social,
political and material protection of its
members, was. inaugurated under the
tnost favorable auspices. The greatest
enthusiasm prevailed. About 200 promi
nent liquor dealers were present and af
fixed their signatures to the charter role.
After the business of the evening had
been transacted a social session, was
was held, during which a tempting colla
tion', with an abundance of liquid refresh
ments, 1 was served. . The newly elected of
ficers and a number of the members made
impromptu speeches and many toast3
were drunk to the good of the order.
Among those who contributed to the
merriment of the evening were: William
McDonald, James Mackey of Sacramento,
JameSi Conlln, Dr. Charles E. Jones and
Charles Mitchell. ,
The officers who were elected to guide
the destiny of the new lodge during the
first term of its existence were:
Valiant commander, Jerome Bassity; lieuten
ant commander, C. F. ' Williams; treasurer,
James Twomey; orator, ! James Horn: re
corder Frank G. Roney; master, of ceremonies,
Dave Becker; captain of guard, John F. Crow
ley; tyler, Frank Stevens; physician. Dr.
Charles E. Jones; attorney, Charles G. Nagle;
advisory boardâ G. O. Hink, J. E. Krumb, J.
Li. Herget, J. Sullivan, J. P. â¢ Glynn. .
Although the order of the Knights of
the Royal Arch has only been in existence
for three years it already has a very ex
tensive membership throughout the Union.
In its ranks are included some of the most
influential liquor dealers in this country.
It is expected that the liquor dealers of
every State will be represented at the
national convention, which will be held
this year at Cincinnati.
The order provides sick and death bene
fits and in fact all the benefits which axe
incidental to a fraternal society.
The lodge which has been organized in
this city is the second in the State. The
first was instituted at Los Angeles, and
already has a membership of 300. It is In
tended by the organizers that every city
and town in the State have a lodge. A
convention will then be called for the
purpose of formjng a Grand Lodge.

Copies of the Jetters will be sent to those
most prominently connected with the wal
nut trade of California, among whom are
Porter Brothers, President Xeff of the
Deciduous Fruit Exchange at Los An
geles, and Edward Berwick at Monterey
Concerning Persian walnuts, about
which the Californians desired to have
questions asked, Consul General Skinner
writes that they- are not known in France
as a local product. Considerable quanti
ties of shelled Levantine walnuts, which
grow in Turkey, are imported into France
and are consumed in the walnut oil trade.
As the French walnuts command a higher
price than do the Levantine nuts, quanti
ties of the Levantine nuts are sent to
the districts where the French walnuts
are grown in large quantities, that they
may be used in making nut oil. The wal
nuts grown near Marseilles are small and
there is no attempt to export them. The
exportation of nuts from Marseilles last
year amounted to $400,000 in round figures.
A'.monds, which represented a value of
J2oS.OOO, led the list, with walnuts second,
valued at $140,000.
â¢'The product of walnuts in California,"
writes the Consul General, "is much dis
cussed in France, but the market in Mar
seilles has not been affected by the Cali
fornia walnuts." The reverse is the case
in the matter of almonds. . While the
French almond, the Princess, is of high
quality, the California almonds have been
sufficiently excellent to replace the French
article largely and the Marseilles trade
has been very much injured in conse
quence.
The Department of State at Washington
has come to the aid of the walnut srow
ers of California and has secured valuable
Information, concerning the condition of
the foreign nut market, into which Cali
fornia may enter more largely than ever
before as a competitor. Some time ago
the Pacific Commercial Museum, by Di
rector Goodwin, requested the> Depart
ment of State to forward to Consuls of the
United States in European countries cer
tain questions formulated here, the
answers to which would embody the in
formation most needed by the producers
of California in their attempts to widen
their trade area. The department agreed
to do this and letters have come to hand
relating to the walnuts of France and
Turkev. The most important of the let
ters received is one from Consul 'General
fckmner at Marseilles. . â¢
He writes that the exports of walnuts
to the L'nited States are confined almost
exclusively to nuts grown in the interior
of the country- The trade Is In the hands
of the commission houses. Their busi
ness has been injured by the practice of
American importers, who deal with the
growers directly and who assume all risks
at unsatisfactory delivery.

Movements of Transports.
Since February last the transports have
brought home over 25,000 volunteers and
regulars. In the handling of all those men
there has not been an accident of any
kind and the dispatch the vessels have
received at this end has been a matter
of favorable comment all along the front.
For instance, the Thomas and Buford
both arrived Wednesday and anchored in
the stream. Without the slightest confu
sion all the men were transferred to river
steamers and landed at the Presidio be
fore dark, while all their baggage was
reedy for them on the wharf the next
morning. This was all due to the excel
lent arrangements made by Surgeon Ma
jor R. J. Gibson, who personally super
vised the transfer of the men and stayed
with the job night and day in order that
there mizht be no hitch.
Of the transports that have arrived with
troops during the past ten days the Logan
Is on Hunters Point drydock, the Thomas,
Grant and Buford are at Folsom street
and the Kilpatrick in the stream. The
Ohio, Aztec and Pennsylvania have been
released by the Government. The Ohio
and Pennsylvania, are going into the
Nome trade and the Aztec is going on the
China run for the Mail Company. The
Algoa, now in port, has been chartered
by Uncle Sam and will load hay and grain
at Seattle for the Philippines.
Â»
Panama Steamships Sail.
The opposition lines both dispatched
steamships for Panama yesterday. The
Pacific" Mail Company's San Juan got
away at noon, while the Panama Railroad
Company's Argyll sailed about 2 p. m.
Both vessels took away a large amount
of freight, but few passengers. The Ar
gyll's cargo is all for New York and the
vessel goes direct to Panama. The San
Juan's cargo is nearly all for Central
American ports and very little of it for
Panama or the East. The Argyll will
reach Panama nearly a, week ahead of
the San Juan, as the latter calls at all the
way ports.
Robert McD. | Mulr, one of the best
known, young men along the front, died
suddenly Thursday night. He was suffer
ing from an ulcerated tooth and did not
heve it attended to. Finally blood pois
oning set in and he died. The deceased
leaves a widow, son and two brothers to
mourn his loss.
The ferry steamer Tamalpais went to
the RIsdon Iron Works yesterday. When
going astern her patent paddle wheels will
not feather and in consequence the vessel
is almost shaken to pieces with every
backward revolution. While at the Rls
don an attempt will be made to rectify
this fault.
The schooner Admiral Is going to load
railroad ties for Guayaquil. She was
chartered to carry merchandise to Salinas
Cruz, ' but the charter has been canceled
in order to enable her to carry the ties.
Several of the Blanche Bates Company
visited the Oregon yesterday. They were
shown over the huge fighting machine
and enjoyed their visit very much.

ly be released this morning. Mrs. Hugh

friends were out to meet her, but were
not allowed aboard the vessel.
The Doric was twenty-seven days

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
The steamship Ammon of the Kos
mos line arrived from Hamburg yester
day. She brought five passengers and a
small cargo from South America, The
passengers were the following named:
From Mollendo â Edgar Powell, E. Con
lis and M. McDerwell. From Callaoâ J.
M. Burnell. From Guayaquilâ R. F. Har
rison.
This is the first visit of the Ammon to
San Francisco. She is not yet five years
old and was built for the South American
trade. 4 She has a capacity of 6500 tons
dead weight, is 370 feet long, 46 feet beam
and 26 feet deep. Captain G. Behrmann
is also making his first visit to this port.
The steamship left Hamburg on March 17
and had fine weather to the river. Platte,
where a severe storm was encountered.
After passing through the Straits of Ma
gellan the screw worked loose on the
shaft and it has been giving trouble ever
since. She will go on the drydock to-day
to be overhauled and painted.
The Ammon passed the Colombia, which
left here for South America ten days ago,
off Cape San Lucas.
KOSMOS LXNER AKEIVES.
Ammon Gets In From Hamburg via
South and Central America.
NJ. WEAVER, who was made
famous in the Orient and
Southern Seas by his cruise
O in the yacht Norma, is about
to undertake another voyage.
The Norma Is still in Auckland, New Zea
land, where ehe was seized for debt, but'
Weaver has secured the Julia E. Whalen
and Is going- to Mexico in her. The ves
sel arrived from Samoa on June 17, after
having touched at the Hawaiian Islands
for provisions. She made the trip to Sa
moa in Weaver's interests, he having se
cured a lot of valuable concessions from
the Germans, so he said. Whether the
concessions are valuable or not nobody
krcws save Weaver, and he is not telling.:
In any event, the Whalen came back with'
a lot of cocoanuts and a small quantity
of copra.
It was Weaver's intention to run the
Whalen regularly in the Samoan trade,
so Captain Erratt secured a native crew
while at Apia. When the vessel arrived
here the white sailors were discharged
and the vessel Is now manned by Samo
ans. A few days ago the destination of
the ' schooner was changed and now the
natives want to be sent home. All the
satisfaction they get is that as soon as
the voyage to Mexico is completed the
Julia E. Whalen will sail for Samoa.
Weaver has live or six people interested
In his Mexican venture and two of them
will sail on the schooner with him. They
are Messrs. Deltenhelmer and Talcott and
with them goes a mining expert. The
mine is supposed to be very rich, and
should it prove to be everything that is
expected the work of developing will be
gin at once. The passengers are not go
ing to starve during the run to Mexico.
All kinds of provisions were put aboard
the schooner yesterday and a colored man
has been especially engaged to look after
the galley. Captain Erratt, who brought,
the Whalen from Samoa, is not going out
on her, a Captain Robinson having suc
ceeded him as master.
Considerable work has been done on the
Whalen during the uast week and she has
now very snug quarters below and looks
as trim as a yacht aloft. On the voyage
Mr. Weaver will probably imagine he is
oiice more on the Norma and . may have
as good a time on the Mexican coast as
he had in Japanese waters and the South
ern Seas.

Ocean do not usually exceed 400 pounds in
weight. *
Some idea of its immense size may be
gained when it is stated that when the
monster was dissected a striped bass
weighing thirty pounds was found in its
stomach. Its dorsal fin was about a foot
in length, while its tail expanded almost
two and a half feet. Its sword measured
over three feet and was equipped on the
under side, with sharp teeth. The car
cass will be placed on exhibition to-mor

His Net OS the Los'An
geles Coast. .
A magnificent specimen' of swordflsh,
weighing 700 pounds and measuring al
most 15 feet from the tip of his tall to the
end of his sword was captured Thursday
afternoon by Antone Ballanti, an Italian
fisherman, just off the coast of Los An
geles. The leviathan was captured in a
net which the fisherman was using for
halibut. It was brought to this city and
all day yesterday was the object of great
curiosity among the Italian fishermen In
the vicinity of A. Bellanti's fish market
on Clay street, where it was on exhibi
tion.

and emblems predominant in all private
as well as public \ decorations. - Busi
ness, men and other citizens who
! have promised to dress their buildings in

prised of the desires of the league in this
matter, and the red and white and the

uous. I
Chairman Norton of the decoration com
â¢mittee reports that thousands . ol\ banners
are being- made for use in the parades and

church South. The Maltese cross occu
pies a prominent position in the center of
the flag. The California bear is also rep
resented. As in all other insignia of the
organization, the league motto, "Look up,
lift up," also appears.
The badge which will be worn by' the
delegates is particularly artistic. It con
sists of ribbon on which is represented
the British and American flags crossed
and dependent is a Maltese cross of or
ange .wood. On the cross are etched the
bear, Bridal Veil Falls, a view of-Wa
wona and. The Call building, with, Market
street stretching to the hills in the back
ground. In the center of the cross is the
league motto and a representation of the
setting sun as seen through the Golden
Gate.
Hundreds of guides for the visitors have
been appointed. They will wear an ap

The detectives are still investigating the
mysterious blaze and supposed robbery in
the saloon of C. Eastman at Ellis and
Mason streets Friday morning with little
chance of ever landing .the culprit.
On account of the' suspicions of Eastman
the police yesterday detained James Gilli-
Ean, a stable boy, who was seen in ' the
vicinity of the place on the night of the
double crime. Last night he was released
as Captain Seymour is Batiefled that he
Is innocent. Gllligan claims that the
"Jimmy" marks on the cash register were
made about a month ago, thus contradict
ing Eastman's statement. The. latter has
all -along maintained that the supposed
robber, after breaking open the register,
set the place on fire to cover up his crime.
He pointed to the marks on the register
to enow that the culprit used a "Jimmy"
to force It open.
Captain Seymour is Inclined to believe
the boy'c statement. MSKSSSKstmtSB&S

In view of these facts and the further
allegation that the company had no op
portunity to be heard before the rate was
finally passed the company demands Judg
ment as stated.
The complaint first deals with the steps
taken by the board in passing the ordi
nance. It was passed to print February
28, between 11:30 p. m. and midnight. On
March 18 it was defeated, but on recon
sideration was passed April L The plain
tiff corporation avers that in passing the
ordinance the board acted arbitrarily, op
pressively and unjustly, with the object
in view of diverting from the reasonable
Income of the water company money for
ether purposes. It is also declared that
in passing the ordinance the Supervisors
"were not actuated by the motive to
establish reasonable and fair rates, but
were actuated and influenced to pass the
same for the purpose of attempting to
gain from the citizens of San Francisco
personal popularity and favor."
Continuing the company sayo that the
plant in actual operation is valued at over
$35,000,000; that the company has borrowed
more than $13,412,000 and carries a mort
gage of $13,075,000; that the interest on
mortgages and other 4 debts for the year
ending June 30, 1902, Is $640,000; that the
operating: expenses are $450,000, and that
the taxes on the company's properties
will be $250,000.
Suit was filed yesterday by the Spring
Valley Water Company to declare null
and void the ordinance passed by the
Board of Supervisors on April 1 fixing the
water rate for the next fiscal year and
to enjoin the board from fixing: any rate
except upon a valuation of $35,000,000, the
value placed upon the water works by the
plaintiff corporation in its complaint.

The matter was reported to the police
last evening, but it Is not believed that
Ruisinger will be prosecuted if he Is
found, as he is a favorite with the men
with whom he has been associated and
whom he is said to have robbed. Rui-
Eir.ger is 42 years old. of heavy build and
a jovial man with all his acquaintances.
He is supposed to possess some means.
When Ruisinger left the city last Tues
day he Informed a few of his personal
friends that he was going to Chicago. He
was seen on Wednesday morning in
Bakersfield and since that time all trace
of him has been lost.
The missing man is well known to the
butchers of this city. He came from Den
ver about fifteen years ago and has
worked for many years in the Bay City
Market. He resigned his position there to
become a Deputy Meat Inspector of the
Health Board, but gave the official posi
tion up when there was a legal tangle
over payment of salaries of the depart
ment. Ruisirger then went to -work for
Echrader Brothers In the New City Hall
Market and his last position was in a
store at the corner of Ellis and Market
streets. - -
Came Here From Denver.
"The members of the union expected to
receive about $6 each when the funds of
the union were divided up. I don't think
that Ruisinger has defaulted in any larger
sum. We were all his friends and if he
was in trouble and had come to us we
would have made his shortage good and
nothing would have been made public"
Investigation made at 721 Ellis street,
where Ruisinger has lived for the past
three years shows that he left the city
on Tuesday last and that his wife left
town the same day. A subtenant in the
house stated yesterday that Ruisinger
and his wife had not removed their prop
erty from the house and had not even
taken any trunks away with them.
It was learned yesterday that Ruisinger
had been playing the races and that while
he boasted of making heavy winnings he
was a loser to a considerable extent. â¢â¢
"Ruisinger has skipped out, and the
books of Butchers' Union 115 show
that he is short J12i5. 'While many men
belong to the two organizations, they
were distinct. The Protective Union was
founded in 1SS6, and is a fraternal and
beneficial organization, while Union 115
was formed four months ago, but was to
go out of existence on the last day of this
month. I have examined the books of the
Protective Union and find that there is
no shortage in our funds unless Ruisinper
has neglected to pay the railroad com
pany for our share of the expense in
curred at our recent picnic. The books
cf the other union. No. 115, snow that
?12Â£5 should be on hand.
George Schade of the Cable Meat Mar
ket. California, and Polk streets, who is
financial secretary of the Journeymen
Butchers' Protective Union, made the fol
lowing statement yesterday:
"I c^mnot believe it is possible," said
Davis, "for Ruisinger was my best friend.
I understand he has not been seen since
Tuesday, and that his books show there
is a shortage. I cannot say at present
what we will do in the matter. The union
had about J130Q on hand, and Ruisinger
had the custody of the funds."
President Davis Surprised.
President Ben Davis of the Amalga
mated Butchers' Union returned yester
day morning from. Los Angeles. It was
with great surprise that he learned that
Ruisinger had slipped out and that the
funds of the union were missing.
Wednesday night Ruisinger was j still
missing and an investigation of his books
was at once ordered. It was learned that
Ruisinger had left the city Tuesday morn-
Ing, and his wife was also reported to be
in the country. Yesterday the various
officers of the two organizations of which
the missing man was treasurer went over
the books, and while every effort was
made to shield Ruisinger, it was evident
that the disappearance of the treasurer
had caused much uneasiness.
The first intimation that the two or
ganizations had that there was anything
â¢wrong was on Tuesday evening last, when
the regular meeting of the two unions
was held. Ruisinger was not on hand,
but while the members present thought
that it was strange he should not be pres
ent, no action was taken until Wednes
day night, when the election of officers
of the Journeymen Butchers took .place.
Charles M. Rulslngrer, treasurer of the
Amalgamated Meat Cutters' and Butchers'
Â¦Workmen's Union and the Journeyman
Butchers* Protective Union, is missing
and an investigation of the books of the
former union has discovered the fact, it
is claimed, that he is a defaulter in the
sum of J12S5.
Missing Man Show a
Shortage.
It Is Alleged That Books of
Butchers' Union Treas
urer Suddenly Leaves
the City.

High temperatures have. aided the distribu
tion of seasonable goods at retail and stimu
lated reorder demands from' wholesalers," al
though the volunme of business has been lim
ited by the fact that sellers are not disposed
to commit themselves largely in view of the

There is also a better tone in woolen goods,

The machinists' strike has unquestionably
hurt this line of. business, but this trouble ap
pears to be subsiding, and the settlement of
the tin plate scale, an advance being conceded
to its workingmen, leads : to the expectation
that other branches of the trade will have a

CHICAGO, June 28.â Disappointing cables and
excellent crop reports were the features which
caused a weak opening. Early in the morn
ing the selling was quite general for both
the local and outside accounts. The buying,
however, was confined mostly to profit taking
shorts, who bought freely on the decline, and
prices rallied somewhat. September opened %c
lower at 66%<Â§Â«7c. but dropped to 66%c on com
mission house selling. On covering by shorts
there was a Blight rally- and the close was
%Â©%c lower at 66%c- . .
Corn opened easier on favorable weather in
sympathy with wheat. Reports of poor crops
in Kansas and Nebraska caused a firmer feel
ing to prevail. September closed unchanged
at 44%c.
I Considerable business was done in the oats
market, but the prices ranged within a narrow
JUmlt. September closed a shade lower - at
Weakness prevailed in' provisions and the
opening was . unchanged to 2%c lower.- Prices
held steady during the/ day on demand for
September lard, which was wanted by commis
sion houses. There Â¦ was considerable selling
of July ribs by commission houses. .September
pork closed 6c lower, lard 2%c lower and ribs
unchanged.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

___^ *
While no great activity was hoped for at
the moment, the street was apparently dis
posed to regard the future of the market with
confidence. The closing of the Seventh Na
tional Bank on Thursday by the Comptroller of
the Currency, however, showed that its con
dition was worse than had been concluded,
and call loan money rates rose . to an high as
15 per cent, though most of the loans were at
6 per cent or a little above that figure. Large
banking houses and institutions lent money
freely, and there was no general calling of
loans. The fact that nubile interest in the
market is relatively small and that stocks are
to a large extent accumulating in strong hands
had its due effect, and prices, though Inclined
to decline, did so in an orderly fashion.
Disturbing features of an entirely unex
pected kind have this week unfavorably in
fluenced the market, which, however, has be
haved exceedingly well. Money was consid
ered likely to hold firm pending the heavy
July 1st interest disbursements, but, as gold
shipments had apparently ceased, ;it waa
thought that this week's bank statement
might be more favorable than the last few
Saturdays'. Renewed banking troubles to many
did not seem to occasion much disquiet eith
er in Berlin or in London, though the latter
market was somewhat heavy on the pessim
istic utterance of the British Prime Minister
about the Boer war and the fading hope of
its early termination. Continued fair crop
prospects, active business conditions and rail
road earnings which present increases even
over the heavy large totals of a year ago,
rendered our markets measurably insensible
to anything adverse in the foreign financial
situation, and Wall street was disposed to con
sider that when the July payments were com
pleted and the summer Investment asserted its
influence there would be a fresh series of rail
road and other deals, .with dividend develop
ments concerning the large Industrial and
ot.ier corporations which would keep up and
widen the bullish speculation.

NEW YORK, June ' 28.â Bradstreet' s Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say:
NEW YORK, June 28.â A strong advance In
prices of stocks on the day of the failure of an
Important Stock Exchange hcuse and on the
day following a failure of a Clearing-house
bank Is an anomaly In Wall street. The action
of the market was the mere notable as com
ing on practically the last day available for the
moi>ey preparations for the dividend and Inter
est disbursements due en the first of the month,
which is Monday next. Stock market borrowing
made on Friday carries over until Monday.
This anomaly In the movement of prices iÂ» un
doubtedly due In part to the fact that the bears
Â¦were overconfident in their anticipations of the
effect of these adverse factors. The early
strength in the market was largely due to the
technical explanation that the accounts cf the
falling firm, which were closed out under the
rule, were almost wholly on the short side of
the market. That is to say. stocks bad to be
bought tinder the rule to close the contract.
thus creating a forced demand which kept up
prices. The firm's accounts covered a fair as
sortment of about fifteen of the principal stocks
and the total number of shares bought In for
their account amounted to 21,300, together with
in. COO. par value, of bonds. Apparently the
only stock sold for their account was Gas and
Eiectric Company of Bergen County.
On Monday of this week It sold on the ex
change at 101%. The first sale to-day of 300
ehares was at 30 cash. The next sale was at 32
cash and the stock subsequently sold at 46%.
Whl!e the settlement of the firm's Stock Ex
change contracts was In progress other busi
ness was almost at a standstill. The expecta
tion among traders was that with the conclu
sion of tbe settlement prices would sag off
again, but after the sales under the rule had
ceaeed to make their appearance on the tape
the money rate began to yield under large offer
ings of loanable funds. Equally significant of
the relaxation In the money situation was the ,
Â»harp recovery In sterling exchange and Ber
lin exchange from their downward course of
yesterday^ pThe covering movement In the last
hour was tae most heavy during the day and
resulted in establishing a final level of prices
Â¦which is quite generally a point or more above
last nlrht. t
The moet conspicuous stocks in the advance
were Atchlson and St Paul, which gained 2%
etch. There were gains of two points or over
br Louisville. Erie first preferred, Chicago, In
dlacapolls and Louisville, Lacka wanna, Denver
ana Rio Grande preferred and Illinois Central
Among the specialties there were gains of 3%
to 2% by Tennessee Coal. Colorado Fuel. North
American, General Electric and American Lin-
Beed preferred. A more cheerful situation is
reported tn Burlington and was a factor in the

CLOSING
' The stock market to-day was still quiet, but
there was an almost complete change in specu
lative sentiment â a reversal of the weakness
and depression of the last few days. Various
factors contributed to this . changed feeling.
Berlin ceased the . selling that has been in
progress since the recent bank failures. The
effects of the failure of the . Seventh National
Bank are now regarded as pretty well dis
counted. The bear contingent hastened to re
purchase the stocks sold, in the belief that
prices were going to sag still further. New
York helped things along by sending buying
orders In Atchlson and Union Pacific, 'while
Erie shares were heavily bought by a Dig To
ronto speculator. The close was buoyant. The
befit market observers and authorities - believe
that a recovery is fairly started. . As to the
immediate outlook it is argued that Â¦ next
month's dividends â¢will accelerate the -upward
movement. : Money is In great demand at 3%

Harrison's circular says: "Durlnjr tha week
tnero have been threa arrivals of coal from
British Columbia, 17,229 tons; five from Wash
ington. 12,836 tons; one from Australia, 2360
tons; total. 32.445 tons. The quantity received
this week is equal to our average consumption,
hence the amount in yard, at present not very
large. Is not being disturbed. Tha quantity of
foreign coal due here the coming month (July)
is about 15,000 tons, less than four days' actual
consumption; thus It can be clearly seen that
fully 80 per cent of the coal at present con
sumed by us must be drawn frqro the coast
collieries. Singular to say that with about
equal to 1, COO, 000 tons of coal displaced by thÂ«
Introduction of fuel oil this year, we arÂ« yet
consuming almost equal to the amount of coal
imported up to date last year. Coal freights
from Australia and England are baing some
what reduced, still > the high prices for coal
that are being maintained at both of these
sources will permit of only light shipments.
Fuel oil is being freely shipped: low prices still
prevail. Protective associations are being
formed for the improvement of fuel oil values,
but so far with very limited success. Contracts
for delivery for two and three years ahead are
being freely made at prices which must cer
tainly leave a particularly small margin Â¦ of
profit to the producer. The present high out
going rates on grain should enable ship-owners
to send vessels here with coal from foreign
sources at very low rates of freight. The out
look for the future Is still lower rates will
rule."

Dun's Review of Trade.
SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Wheat prospects are further improved
throughout the entire producing region. More
satisfactory to the producer than evidence* of
a banner yield is the failure of quotations to
show commensurate decline, for there is good
profit at the present prices.
In four weeks Atlantic exports, flour Included,
aggregated 13,669,000 bushels, against 10,480.076
bushels last year, and 8,934.638 bushels in 1899,
while Pacific exports were 3,505,400 bushels,
compared wi*h 2.853,978 bushels in 1900, and 2,
443,740 bushels two years ago.
Gains are more conspicuous In the woolen
goods division, because depression has lasted
long and been severe. As the raw material
gradually sought a lower level, mills restricted
purchases In anticipation of better terms ex
cept where orders for goods were secured. The
clothing trade Is now seeking men's wear wool
ens and worsteds and buyers find stocks light.
Values havo not yet hardened, but there la lit
tle thought of lower prices, either for goods
or raw wool. In knit goods jobbers are taking
stock, after which activity is expected.
Failures for the week number 204 in. the
United States, against 207 last year, and 23 in
Canada, agalnet 21 last year.
The fiscal year closes with conditions In tho
Iron and coal Industry In marked contrast to
tho situation at tho corresponding date in 190C.
Quotations were then - receding rapidly with
out stimulating activity, idleness was the rule
at furnaces and mills, and waga scales woio
under serious discussion with employers and
labor organizations far apart in -their views.
This year difficulty Is experienced In stopping
machinery long enough' to make necessary re
pairs. Prices are well maintained and steady
with unreasonable Inflation, while a successful
season makes it possible, for many concerns to
avoid controversy by voluntarily reducing
hours or advancing. wages, and evidences of Se
rious disagreement are the exception. Con
struction proceeds at an unprecedented pace,
so that structural material, builders' hardware
and kindred goods find ready purchasers. I Rail
way facilities are Inadequate to handle expand
ing traffic and shops aro crowdod with orders
for new freight cars and other equipments.
Footwear forwardlngs from Boston have av
eraged over 100,000 cases weekly for two
months, raising the total for the half year
to 2.358.521 cases, according to weekly records
of the Shoe and Leather Reporter. The largest
previous . total for the corresponding I months
was In 1900 and fell 154,151 cases short of the
current year. Exports to Great Britain are a
most satisfactory factor in the present move
ment. Some of the Eastern shops are so well
supplied with contracts that deliveries cannot
be promised before September. Local manu
facturers are running on short time or closed
for stock-taking. Stocks in dealers' hands are
light, which give the market a strong tone.
Leather is active and firm, with hemlock sole
in good demand. Upper leather is selling read
ily. Receipts of imported dry hides are light
and prices well sustained.
NEW YORK, June 28.â R. G. Dun & Com
pany's Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will
say: It does not follow, because bad banking
methods have caused one of the smaller New
York banks to close its doors, with attendant
circumstances, that created discussion In Wall
street, that general business is in any way af
fected by. or at all responsible for, the trouble.
The country Is undeniably prosperous and ,wlth
prospect of an abundant harvest to. supply our
own needs and Increasing European defiden-"
e'es,' the situation is Viewed with confidence.
A few more labor disturbances have arisen, but
others havo been settled, notably the dispute
over the tin plato seals. Some disagreements in
the coal regions at times assume a threatening
aspect, but. the 'troubles have been local and
do not affect the mining Industry. Reports from
tho country epcak of a continued active move
ment - of merohandlas with tha Jobbing trade
and embracing nearly all lines. Â»

NEGRO KILLS TWO MEN
TO ESCAPE A LYNCHING
West Virginia Mob Has to Pay Dear
ly for Attempting to Over-
ride Law.
PANTHER. W. Va., June 28.â The at
tempt of a mob to lynch a negro at Jager^
to-day resulted In the killing of two of
the would-be lynchers. The negro, Peter
Price, | was accused of insulting a white
woman. He was pursued by a crowd of
men and sought refuge in a small room
in the rear of a saloon. The mob battered
down the door, and as they entered the
room Price threw himself at 'them with
the ferocity of a tiger with a knife In
each hand. In cutting his way out he
killed George Hooks and F. M. McGran
and seriously cut Charles Davis.
As Price struck down these men the oth
ers fell back and the negro made his es
cape through an open window. Price was
pursued and captured by officers, who
hurriedly sent him to the Jail at Welch.
Hooks and McGran were both well-known
citizens.

VAQUERO LASSOES AUD
KILLS A LARGE EAGLE
Exciting Combat Takes Place on the
Be Long Ranch Near San
SAN RAFAEL. June 28.â An exciting
battle took place on one of the large
ridges of the De Long Ranch yesterday,
when Thomas Sutton, a vaquero, lassoed
and afterward killed an enormous eagle.
â¢ "Yesterday morning I was riding over
the ranch, looking for some cattle," said
Sutton to-day In describing the combat.
"As I went up over a high knoll on tha
ridge I rode right on to two large eagles
that were sitting on the ground. One of
them became frightened and flew away.
The other tried to fly, but was only able
to flap along the ground, owing. I believe,
to the fact that It had just gorged, itself
on a nearby carcass.
"I got out my riata and threw a loop
over the bird. The rope fastened to a
wing and then the fun commenced. The
eagle flew at my horse. It was only by
some lively running that I waa able to
tangle him up in a brush patch, where
after considerable trouble I killed â¢ him.
Eagles are scarce here, these two being
the only ones seen in years."
Sutton took his prize to Novato, where
it was an object of much curiosity, and
later sent it to San Francisco to be
mounted. The bird's wings had a spread
of seven feet.

OAKLAND, June 28.â A boating party
from Alameda on the tidal canal this
evening terminated In the drowning of one
boy and the making of a hero of another
lad, who saved the life of one companion
and almost succeeded In saving the boy
who was drowned. The party was com
posed of four boys living In Alamedaâ
Paul Bordwell, son of the late George A.
Bordwell; Arthur Gott. son of a Park
street jeweler; Samuel Nathan and Claud
Smith. Young Smith was drowend. Bord
well saved the life of Nathan. Smith is a
colored lad and lived with his mother,
Mrs. E. L-. Smith, a dressmaker, at 2412
Buena Vista avenue. ..
The boys* went out rowing shortly after
dinner. About 10 o'clock it was proposed
that they go home. This was opposed by
Claud Smith, the boy who was drowned.
The boys began struggling. Smith trying
to hold Nathan to prevent him from row-
Ing. In the scuffle Smith and Nathan fell
overboard. Neither was able to swim.
Bordwell was the only one able to swim,
and it devolved upon him to try to save
the lives of his two companions in the
water. He bravely swam for the strug
gling lads and managed to catch young
Nathan and swim with him to the shore.
He .then returned for -smith, but he was
too late. The colored lad sank in a deep
hole. Young Gott remained In the boat.
Â¦ Nathan is now under the care of a. doc
tor, but will recover. Bordwell did not
suffer any injury.

WASHINGTON, June 2S.-It is said at the
State Department that the demand of tha
powers for 450,000,000 taels ($327,000,000) may
be sufficient to meet even the additional
claims some cf the powers contemplate
presenting to China. The department haa
received a statement of the claims pre
sented by each power and they give a
total of 415.000.CO0 taels ($301,000,000). It was
suggested that 33,000.000 taels ($25,400,000).
the difference . between this sum and the
amount of the lump sum demanded by the
powers, be refunded to China. It 13 alto
gether unlikely that the powers will per
form such an act of generosity. Germany
proposes to increase its claim for military
expenses by 10,000,000 or perhaps 12,000,000
taels.
Because Japanese bonds sell at less than
par, SO being the price quoted, the Jap
anese Government has Informed the pow
ers that it proposes to increase its Indem
nity in order that it may not suffer a I033
in consequence of the expenses it has in
curred. Japan has submitted a very mod
est claim, ?25,000,000, and the authorities do
not object to its efforts to secure an addi
tional $5,00O.COO. which will reimburse It for
tho expenditures.
But the authorities seriously object to
Germany's claim for additional compensa
tion. It Is feared that the effect of Ger
many's action will be to cause other pow
ers to increase their claims, and if thU
should be done, then the 35.000,000 taeli
will be distributed 'among the govern
ments anxious to wrest China's last cent
from her treasury.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
BOSTON, June 28.â The' oration of
"Ideals In Politics" which "Wayne Mac-
Veagh delivered before the Phi Beta Kap
pa at its annual meeting at Cambridge,
has attracted unusual attention. Among
other things MacVeagh said:
. It seems to me quite too plain for dispute
that no slnsrfe member of a weaker race can
be killed; no hut of such a race, however
humble, can be burned; no one can be selected
for especial honor for his part in such pitiful
warfare without its helping 1 to light the torch
which r.tarts the fire by which some hapless
negro is to be burned at the stake in our own
country, not only in defiance but in contempt
of law, and all such acts must be surely fol
lowed by greater Insecurity for the surplus
wealth which the contented class possesses.
. Now it is at least quite possible that in the
not distant future American politics may
transform Webster's warning: into history, for
our electorate is already beginning to be dl-'
vlded, and must. In obedience to the law of
social evolution, continue more and more to be
divided by that pharp cleavage which separ
ates thope who are contented with their lot
from those who are discontented with their
lot.
Under whatever dlsculses, called by what
ever names. Inheriting or itelzlnsr whatever
partisan organization, the alignment of two
great political divisions of American votors
who will sooner or later struggle utralnst each
other for the possession of the Government,
will Inevitably be upon the basis I have
named. The party of the contented will be
ranged under tne banner and the party of the
discontented will be ranged under the other,
(ini that alignment will steadily develop in
creasing sharpness of division until the party
of the discontented, being the majority, has
obtained the control of the Government, to
which, under our system, they are entitled,
and then they will be sure to remodel the
present system for thÂ»s distribution of wealth,
unless we have previously dona so, upon bases
wider and more equitable than those now exÂ»
jst|nr, Th9 one party will lie, under whatever
name, the party of capital, and thÂ« other
party will be, under whatever nama, the part/
pf laborr
H certainly would tend to mÂ»VÂ» private

Before an Electro
cution.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 28.-Mrs. Ed
win Ruthven, wife of the Cleveland mur
derer who was electrocuted at the peni
tentiary early this morning, made a last
effort to save the life of her husband. In
the presence of the Rev. W. M. Langford
and others she declared that she herself
killed Policeman Shipp. She said that on
the night of the murder she and her hus
band had a little quarrel and she left tho
house to cool her wrath. She met Charles
Jacobs, the mysterious individual of
which Ruthven spoke so often, and he
p?ked for Edwin, saying that he had a
Job on hand. She told him that her hus
band was not at home, but that she would
help.
According to her story, she dressed her
self in her Husband's clothing and assisted
Jacobs in committing' the burglary. Po
liceman Shipp appeared on the scene and
Jacobs fled, ler.ving her alone with the
policeman. She said she shot and killed
Shipp. Ruthven, when told of the con
fession, declared that It was not true and
that his wife was "Innocent of any crime.

DETROIT, June 28.-"Unlfication of Re
form Forces and Organization" was the
subject discussed at to-night's meeting of
the second national social and political
conference. Professor Seely of Ohio Uni
versity, the first speaker, advocated di
rect legislation. H. G. Wllshlre of Los
Angeles, Cal., argued for a co-operative
system as against the present competitive
wage system, and asserted that three
years from now the co-operative system
would be recognized as the remedy for
present economic conditions and woula be
generally adopted.
Professor E. W. Bemis of New York
discussed "The Place of Trades Unions In
Reform Movements." He said:
"In order. to progress socially and eco
nomically .we must educate and organize,
and I think that the unions are giving
men lessons that will help greatly Tn or
ganizing the masses."
Discussing Professor Bemis' paper, the
Rev. Mr. .Mills of Chicago gaid that labor
must, follow the " example of the great
trusts, and by becoming polUical masters
of tho country make themselves an inter
national factor.

WASHINGTON, June 28.â The Census
Office to-day issued a bulletin giving the
number of persons of school age, males
of military age and voting age, and citi
zenship of foreign born males 21 years
of age and over, from Alabama, Alaska,
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado
and Connecticut. It shows the number of
persons of school age, 5 to 20 years, In
clusive, and the males of school age, re
spectively, as follows:
Alabama, 733,222 and 367,757; Alaska,
11,408 and 2000; Arkansas, 529,375 and 2G5,
541; California, 420,081 and 212,723; Colo
rado, 160,531 and 80,729, and Connecticut,
257.101 and 127,962.
The males of military ace: Alabama,
328,999; Alaska. 19,703; Arizona, 34,231; Ar
kansas. 230.30S; California, 358,877; Colo
rado. 142,138, and Connecticut, 207,696.

bama, 413,862, of which the native born
number is 405,558; Alaska. 37,500, native
born 26.4S9; Arizona. 44,081. native born

the whole number: 33.7 per cent in Ala
bama, 26.3 per cent in Alaska, 23.9 per
cent in Arizona and 20 per cent in Ar

Senator Scott Denies Having
Made Promise to Grand
Army Men.
f=X>ecial Dispatch to The CalL
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON. June 28.â A sudden
collapse has come in the movement to in
duce President McKinley to. appoint a new
Commissioner of Pensions, the alleged
ground that the Republican National
Committee promised Evans' head to Gen
eral Sickles.
General Sickles' friends have been say
ing that Senator N. B. Scott of West Vir
ginia, who was the leading member of the
National Committee In 1S96, wrote a letter
promising that Commissioner Evans
should be removed. Senator Scott was in
the city to-day, and on learning of this
statement called on Commissioner Evans
and assured him that he had made no
euch promise.
"I am positive," Bald Senator Scott,
"that I wrote no such letter. During the
campaign 2 received many letters from
old soldiers criticizing Evans. I dictated
answers to these letters, and may have
expressed the opinion that Mr. Evans
would not remain as Commissioner of
Pensions, but at no time within my recol
lection did I write to any one making any
promise on behalf of the President.
Scott Had No Authority.
**I had no authority to make any such
promise, as neither the President nor the
National Committee had Instructed me to
do bo. If any such letter is in the posses
sion of fcny one it is outside of the author
ity of the National Committee or its
chairman. I asked my stenographer if she
remembered writing any letter to General
Sickles. She said I had dictated some
thing like 18,000 letters to her during the
campaign and that she had no recollection
of any letter to General Sickles promising
the removal of Commissioner Evans."
President McKinley has listened to the
complaints of old soldiers and also to the
other side. It can be stated that he has
no onÂ© In mind as Commissioner Evans'
Fuceeseor. and hÂ« Is said to be much im
pressed with the cleanness of Commls
eioner Evans* administration and the
commendation that Evans has received
from the press.
The Commissioner's statement, includ
ing the letter of General Sickles com
mending the management of the pension
bureau, is regarded In official circles as
closing the controversy, so far as General
Sickles is a factor.
Sickles Publishes Correspondence.
NEW YORK, June 28.â Nettled by the
denial of Senator Scott, chairman of the
last Republican National Committee, that
the removal of Commissioner Evans lad
been promised. General Daniel Slcklea to
aay made public the correspondence In re
gard to the disputed matter. General
Sickles expressed great indignation.
"In view of this denial," he said, "I
herewith give to the press my correspond
ence with Senator Scott. Based upon the^e
assurances from the Republican National
Committee, I caused it to be known in the
V estern States I visited in October that
Commissioner Evans would be superseded
in March, when his term expired. These
assurances were ratified by the President
on November 27. after election, in the
presence of representative soldiers from
different parts of the country, when we
visited him at the White House by ap
pointment to congratulate him upon his
re-election. He then stated to us that it
was his Intention to choose a successor to
Commissioner Evans at the expiration of
his term of office."
Sickles publishes Senator Scott's letter
in which Scott stated his belief that Pres
ident McKinley would choose a successor
to Evans, a man who would be satisfac
tory to the old soldiers. Scott closed his
letter in these words: "This Is all I can
say without embarrassing the President."
General Sickles says ne then wrote to
McKinley; "but." says Sickles. "I must
decline to state what answer the President
made. The time has not arrived yet. I
will say, however, that unless Evans is
removed there will be 'music' "
Old Soldiers Will Not Be
Able to Cause His
Removal.

A. C. Campbell made a. direct charge
before the Board of Public W r orks yester
day that there is a "coal ring" In, this city
for the purpose of controlling the furnish
ing of coal to the city. Campbell began by
charging that the specifications
arranged that a certain firm alono can
get the contracts. He was sharply called
to order by Colonel Mendell, who asserted
that the" Board of "Works was" capable of
managing its affairs without- Â¦ dictation
from Campbell. The coal contract was
then awarded to Thomas Morton at $9 per
ton. A number of other contracts were
awarded, and in some instances at prices
less than those secured by the Board of
Suoervisors.

The Supreme ; Court . yesterday denied
the .writ of habeas corpus sued out for
the release of Albert C. Col burn, a wit
ness against the Modoc County lynchers.
Colburn's testimony before the ! Grand
Jury was thought by the lynchers to bode
111 for the accused and he was ordered out
of the country by the lawbreakers. He
attempted to escape, but was arrested and
imprisoned. The action of the court de
tet mines that he must be Jbeld to furnish
the desired evidence.

casion. The Sub-Treasury will be opened

The Call recently announced that there
would be a. shake-no in the accounting
department of the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company. It is now generally be
lieved that some important changes are
about to be made. Several officials in the
auditing branch of the service have re
ceived notices requesting their Immediate
appearance : at Omaha. They left last
evening, among- them being E. E. Holton,
ticket auditor with headcuarters in the
railroad building at the corner of Fourth
and Townsend streets. What the outcome
of their trip East will be is hard to say,
but the close affiliation of ..the Union and
Southern Pacific roads seems to point to
the fact that there will be a consolidation
of the Union and Southern Pacific ac
counting departments.

MAJOR WILLIAM SINGER, a
veteran of the 'Mexican war.
passed away at his residence in
this city last Thursday evening
at the advanced age of 89 years.
Deceased was born in Pittsburg, Pa.,
and entered the army In 1833. From that
time until 1850, v.hen he emigrated to Cal
ifornia with his family, he was in the ser
vice of the Government.
During, the preliminary stages of the
controversy between the United States
and Mexico Major Singer was called to
Washington, and jifter being given careful
instructions was^brdered to go to New
Mexico and California to investigate and
report on their resources. , .
With but a small force of about fifty
rather Inexperienced cavalrymen, new to
the tactics of border warfare, to guard
the $200,000 provided to defray the ex
penses of the proposed research from fall
ing into, the hands of Mexican guerrillas,
the major started. The little party met
with more than one thrilling and perilous
adventure, but on account of the caution
as well as the coolness which were among
the chief features of his character Major
Singer accomplished the mission intrusted

to him by the Government. His report
was carefully prepared and contained val
uable information. It would have been
recognized and appreciated more fully
when laid before Congress but for the fact
that the motive for the expedition and the
need of his report had then become sec
ondary in the course of politics. â
Shortly after his arrival in California in
1S50, Major Singer engaged in mining, but
his health failing he had. to retire from
that field. In 1S53 he went to Marysville
then a flourishing 'city, and in the fall of
the same year he was. elected Justice of
the Peace. He was re-elected to the same
office twice, and shortly thereafter was
elected Associate Justice of the County
Court of Sessions of Tuba County, to
which office he was re-elected to succeed
himself until the court was abolished In
1858 he was elected Mayor of Marysville
After his retirement from this office he
practiced law until he reached the age of
75 years, when he retired. .

briefly, expressing the regret he felt at
leaving such pleasant associations.
The news of Mr. Pollok's resignation
was a source of much regret to those
who have been associated with him in
the Palace Hotel, and they determined
to show their appreciation of his worth
