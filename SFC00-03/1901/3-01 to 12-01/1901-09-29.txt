especially if one has seen her a half BOW
before taming some wild bronco or throw*
ing an outlaw steer.
They are royal entertainers, of thÂ«
Southern type, and the "Ellison dances'*
are famous over central Arizona. Every
unmarried cowboy within a radius et
fifty miles of the Ellison ranch has at
some time within the past three years
been a suitor of Mi3S Dena, and several
times serious trouble and shooting affrays
have been narrowly averted beca.usÂ« of
her favoring some particular one.
Dena doesn't care. Men may fight over
hrt\ "for all of me," she says. She. lives
in" anticipation of the fall of the year.
Then the bears descend from the top of
the mountains to the foothills, whers
juniper berries and oak mast* furnish an
abundance of food of the kind relished
by bruin: Here it is that the Ellisoa
family do their hunting, and It Is nothlns;
unusual for them to start ten or more
bears in one day. ,.Â« :r^ ; '..-
Last fall four full crown and three
yearling bears were killed la one day by
the Ellisons. Black and cinnamon bears
are the most numerous, but occasionally
a silver tip or a humpback grizzly wan
ders down from the northern hills, furn
ishing an exciting fight for any onÂ» who
crosses his path. .."i- .
At any time during the fall months cut
may see~ from ten to twentv bear hldss
and' occasionally a lion pelt pegged up
against the sides of the ranch buildings,
drying, while" rocte of fence will be cov
ered vrithfcear "jerky." Bear grease Is
not used fcr hair cil there, but Is tried
out by the barrel fcr use in cooking, lard
being very expensive on account of the
distance from the railroad.
Mrs. Ellison is interested In the bear
grease. But Dena says that is a phasa
of the bear that does not concern her,
What she likes Is tho flxht. . .

Living always in the midst of danffers
Indiana and wild btasts, you might
' caect & large-sized man to b* frightened
once in a while, to say nothing of a little
girl. But Dena has always looked upon
Indians as rather spicyâ she has so few
amusements, living" down there, that she
looks to. them for sport. And as for fears
âwait until you get to the^xeal story.
Colonel Ellison came to Arizona- from
Texas some sixteen years ago, on :
the head "of'. ; Ton'fo Creek, near Prornonr.,
tory Butte, almost within a jjtone's throw
of the "Rim,'' that vast upheaval"'of rock,
stretching half way across Arizona from ,
east to west, and known "as the Mogollon -
range, of mountains. Here he "brought his
family and herds of cattle*; together with .
a pack of hunting dogs, arid settled down
'.n a narrow canyon under; the rim;" where'
the range was good and hunting the. best
In the world. . ,. . .. :Â«
. Fruit trees of various kinds were plant
ed, houses and corrals were built 'of
shakes and rails, split from trees -in' the
largest unbroken pine forest In the world.^
a ditch was dug to irrigate > a small tract
of land or vegetables, for "a^family' living
in this district must ralsÂ» nearly every
thing- needed..- . -. . Â¦ ,'.\. â¢â,. ..â¢,_,-
Here the Ellisons lived .. for several
years, riding the range In the summer
season, roping, branding and ear-marking
the calves and gathering steers, for
market. *
In the fall and winter Colonel Ellison
spent much of the time with his bounds
Â»nd ono or more of the girls hunting tho
countless bears and mountain lions, not
only for the bounty of $20 each, but be
cause of their destructlveness I to stock.
The girl* soon learned to be as' handy as
their father with .a gun, or rope, so that
they could rope, tie and brand. the wildest
steer as well and as quicky as any man,
and when it somes to handling a rifle or
six-shooter most men would'- have to
retire. . . ,. -
Of the whole family, however, there was
no one who handled, a rope, , a rifle or a
six-shootor with the same neatness that
Dena showed. ;^Y;..,,v
"That child Is a' born ranchtr,". . . her
father said with pride. y\
Her prowess cont!nÂ«ed. From, bringing
down birds -and .small game, she Â¦went on
until she ,'came to killing bears. \ Â¦ ,
Eight years ligo the colonel found that
it was becoming tQO thickly settled in his
location. So he moved' still 'farther .away
frorn^ civilization and took up his home, on
the present ;ranch, where 20,000 head -of
cattle could? roam over 100 miles square.
Here he and' his family found plenty of
excitement. . . . . '. \ ,).

entered 'the bear's lunga and as she rose
to ; seize the girl frothy Iblood from the
bear's nostrils was blown into Dena's eyes
and face, making it almost impossible for
her to/ see.' â¢' ,'" V' Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦"'''
: Roaring furiously, the bear seized the
horse by the neck. This angered Dena so
much; it being henfavbrite pony, thatshe
leaned forward and shoving her 45 'Colt's
into the bear's ear fired; tearing the bear's
head almost off and ending what had been
one of the most exciting moments of her
life. . : ;: .,â¢"â¢-. ; :.-Â¦'.Â¦"., Â¦'"Â¦ :"-"â¢â¢ Arv,- Â¦
1 Having 'finished 'the' 1 old' bear, she next
turned her attention to_ the cubs, while's
.were whining and moaning in the top. of
'a small .pine." ' Uncoiling .her riata*' she
was able after, several throws to place a
"noose' over the head of one 'of' them .and
she quickly jerked ; him., to | ,the. ground,
where it was the work of 'but a moment

his four legs together, not," however, with

bites. -Being' unable to rope the other one,
on account of the dense foliage Interven

ing the two dead bears "and tying the. live

her t way, ;' better {off -by' two scalps', worth

" "Xnpther . time, when out with her father,
they * had started a large .cinnamon bear
and: were .following ;the dogs as closely
as the, roughness of the country would
permit." ,'- t The dogs, numbering nearly
twenty, finally bayed the bear In the bend i

rushed in to seize the bear from behind.
The bear was too quick,, however; and
turning:, grabbed 'the o*^,, by ono leg,
crushing the bones and almost tearing
the .leg from : the body. "WithouV a 1
thought as to the consequences, Dena
rushed' forward and shot tho bear

Dropping the dog, the bear turned upoa
her and with one sweep of his powerful
paw knocked the. Winchester several
rods, just as she was upon the point of
iShpOtlng' again. Fortunately for her, her
father rushed, between, them with' his
horse, at the . same time shooting the
bear through the body and giving Dena
8 chance to gain "her horse. Meantime
the doers again heeled the bear, and a
lucky shot from Dena's six-shooter ended
.the flglit. The barrel of her Winchester
was so bent from the force of the bear's
blow an to be useless afterwards.
â¢ Last fall she roped a black bear weigh-.
Ing 'over 200 pounds and dragged him so
nearly to death that she was able to dis
mount and cut his throat without danger,

Thla Cuban beauty has, above all
things, that graceful quality that is born,
and not acquiredâ the quality of distinc
tion.
She suggests Emma Calve as she looked
at the same age as the senorita. There is
In her face the dormant faculty of
thought that is rare in most of the
acknowledged beauties.
Her eyes are large, dreamy, dark, and
they look at you without artifice, quite
â¢ simply, a little too seriously, perhaps, for
an accomplished beauty.
I fancy, however, that Senorita Alfonsa
Aldama is not so . accomplished In the
subtle arts as one might expect of beauty^
for she has been brought" up in the se
vere restrictions of a Cuban household.
In Cuba young women of the social
â¢world are never allowed to be seen In the
society of a man alone, and never on the
streets, at the theater, in the parks where
the people congregate in the qool of the
evening, without a chaperon or a member
of their own families.
"The only thing the girls may do in
Cuba is to get married." said the senorita
in explanation of the early marriages that
are made there,

ef observation. . 'â¢' .â¢
Gallantry has embarrassed tradition
and confused the radius.
Â¦When I was presented to Senorita Al
_cr.sa Aldama and was told that she was
the queen of beauty in Cuba, so declared
In Havana by a majority public vote of
eighteen thousand, criticism was dls-.
armed and sentiment became Intrusive. .
It Is s. human impossibility to be a etoio

eiuillsng* any man to prove It otherwise.
Z have been under tire of various queens
â * queen of burlesque, a queen of tra-
St&Y, a queen ef song, even a tight rope
cuee-no-but there was no flavor of senti
xaest in them compared -with this queen
Tradition has declared that a queen is

man that' she owes her negalia, butâ she
is a queen- -"And there Js no' disrespect In
this example, for the impulse of adoration
Is merely the steam of sentiment at^ish
pressure. . Â¦ "Â¦', v .
In the presence of a^ beautiful woman
one is coVifronted with a problematic
question as to .whether she has as much
heart as she has beauty. It^is not a rea
sonable question, for there is no rule of
nature that admits it, but as the- mind of
man persistently ca6ts cynical shadows .
on the fairest things of earth, the.tradi
tional notion that beauty Is heartless has
survived. ' Â¦
The sequence of this thought demanded
that I s&ould ask the Queen pt Beauty
how she had so far escaped the ignominy
of marriage. -," . .'..-.
I say ignominy in t a Cuban sense, for
no married woman can ever be a Queen
of^Beauty in Cuba. .
It is forbidden. ' Â¦>/ , :
Of course, a direct reply was not to be
hoped for,' not even expected, but the
senorita has become sufficiently Ameri
canized to value that enigmatical delight
of modern femininity known as a "good
time." A "good time" Is never so good
after marriage, and the senorita informed
me in' her own demure fashion that these
were her convictiona.
"You are not even engaged?" I ventured
in tremulous innocence. .
' "Not* at all," she said, aa she looked
compassionately upon me, with a faint
smile as she said It. .
"Then.what Is the prize one gets for be
ing. a'Queen of Eeauty in Cuba?" I asked,
"really- perplexed. . ;
\ ."I received a pold jeweled watch, which
Iâ here you sayâ raffled?"
. . ."Raffle ( d!" I said.
'Â¦Yes, among my friends, and
raised $1000, which I gave to the poor of
Havana." â¢
Never say again that beauty is heart
less! If cold type could but describe the
soft, lisping a.ccent of the Cuban, woman
when she speaks English the winning ef
fect of this simple acknowledgment that
beauty has -.Heart could not escape the
most cynical reader.
The ipmantic side of the senorita'a n4
ture was adamantâ that is, to an inquisi
tive interviewer. Perhaps . I was ineffi
cient in this direction; most men are.
Yet in some degree' I was rewarded . for
my curiosity.
. "I am very plain. I ' like . only to enjoy
myself," said the senorita frankly. ...
"And what is your enjoyment?" ;
"To go to 'theaters,, operas, â¢ ballsâ to
have a good time." â¢'
"You read?"
"Yes. I am fond of reading."
"AVhat books?" I asked, .curious to
measure the influence of mind on; mat
ter.' .'-_- ' :- : -~,-
; "Perhaps, if I tell- you, people will be
surprised to think that "I read "such
books," ' she said hesitatingly. . I "braced
myself for the shock and steeled myself
to her embarrassment. .
"Not at all. I am ' sure you havp read
nothing thoughtless," I said encourag
ingly. ; . . ':.Â¦Â¦ ..'Â¦ ; Â¦ ;. Â¦ - Â¦ '- ;
The senorita's nature is simple, as I
said before. There is really no artificial
coquetry about her. She. is too well bred
for affectation, and 'she answered - me
thoughtfully, seriously, j. \ â¢ A
edged beauty is going to do somethingâ
marry a nobleman, enter a conx'ient, go on
the stage, elope with a Hungarian Â¦musi
cian, anything conventionally; sensational ;
but the Senorita Alfonsa Aldama is an
aristocrkt and the mere thougrht'of. being
en. 'That is why the Cuban girls of the
good ' families do ) not go . .out much. ' A
Spanish woman would not think'she was
at all attractive if men' did not, talk non

/It'wcs easy to trace the freedom of the
serenader in this surviving custom of gen

One always expects that' an acknowl-
of Beauiy when she is seen "en the street?"

In trumps it is dangerous to make this
finesse, if partner hes led trumps for the
protection of a suit and It is desirable
to take out two rounds of trumps imme
aiateiy. It you do not have a reason for
finessing aside from the gaining of an im
mediate trick you should not make the
finesse, for if the finesse loses to fourth
hand he must then lead something to
which you are the last player; if this po
sition is not an advantage Â¦ to you you
should not finesse.
Holding a king, singly, guarded, or a
major tenace in a suit or both, , you are
in a good position to be led up to should
your finesse lose and you are justified in
making ft. When trumpj ai e led original
ly by partner you are justified | in deep
lmessing. holding ace, knave and others;
you credit your partner with at least one
honor and the knave is a fair finesse, as
you are only finessing against one card;
which must make, if guarded, in any
event. However, should partner show
great- strength you should "be very care

When partner leads a low tard you
know, if the lead is a regular one", that he
holds three cards higher than the one
led. You must be guided by this knowl
edge in making a finesse in trumps.
Finessing by trial is a finedse made at
second-hand play; thus A leads the 2 from
king, 5, 8, 2; second hand holding ace, 10,
5. plays 5; third hand plays queen and
fourth hand plays the 3. A, to lead again,
leads the 8; second hand^can here'flnesse
the 10, as he knows third hand (barring
false carding) cannot have the knave, as
.he played the queen. This finesse- should
usually be made when strong in 'trumps â
strong enough to lead them should - the
finesse lose.

Sixth Lesson on Playing Whist
* -INHERE are no specific rules for
I 'finesse; it requires good whist
I knowledge, and players, unless ex-
I perienced, should not practice it to
X, any great extent There are, how
ever, a few rules that apply to certain
holdings, one of which Is the obligatory
finesseâ a finesse you are bound to make
to keep command of your own suit. Then
there is the finesse proper," or ace. queen
fireeseâ a simple form of finesse that can
be readily understood by the beginner.
Finesse is a term applied to almost anv
strategy of the game, such as holding up,
underplaying or refusal to take a trick,
and these subjects have already been
touched upon.
There are no lessons that cojild possibly
teach finessing in ail its foims, as there
are so many things' to be considered one
must necessarily be a good whist player,
with -an understanding cf the situation in
every case, to practice them extensively.
fcfowever, no matter how little one
knows of the game of whifet, if one at
tempts to play it he should know
enough to keep command of his' own
suit should the cards be distributed in
such a manner as to make this necessary.,
He should make the obligatory finesse.
For example: A's longest suit is spades,
of which he holds king. 9. S, 7, 5. He opens
it with the 7, to which C plays the 2. B.
A's partner, plays the queen. D plays tho
8. B returns his partner's suit, having
three caTds in it originally. He returns
the highest of the two left, the 6. D plays
the 10. Now if A plays his king he givei
up command of his suit, and there Is not
another trick in it for him. A should
make the obligatory finesse and, although
tee and knave both may be in C's hand,
be cannot, lose bv the play. A should play
the 5, and if C has the ace singly it must
fall to the trick, although already won by
C's partner, and A's suit is cleared. Now
if trumps are out A's king will briiv?
down the knave, and he must make tb*
9 and 8.
It is a great advantage to get a
strengthening card from partner in your
suit, and one should always return the
highest card in his partner's suit if he
holds only three cards in it originally.
Holding four cards or mow, he Is justi
fied in returning the lowest, as he may
expect to make his own high cards in that
euit, as four cards of a suit is considered
a strong suit.
Again A leads fourth best, from knave,
9, 8, 7, 6. C plays the 2, B plays the king,
D plays the ace. B, to lead, plays the 5.
D plays the 3. Now if A plays the knave
he cannot make a trick in the suit. He
must play the 6, for even if he finds the
queen and 10 in C's hand he cannot lose.
Had he held knave, 10, 8, 7. 6. he would
play the 10, unless the 9 fell in the pre
vious play. That is what is called mak
ing the obligatory finesse.
The finesse proper is the simplest form
of finesse: holding ace, queen of a suit led
by partner, if ho i*-nd.Â« it small card." you
SARAH COMSTOCK.
It Is to be seen whether she is to rewin
these titles or whether the song has flown.
It is also to be' heard what San Fran
cisco will have to say to her. We shall
bfc kept guessing "until the Grau season.
Until this season she has spent her
widowhood in retirement, looking after
Terry's daughter. She has entertained at
times, but not as much as formerly. She
gathers the few congenials and sings to
them when she becomes lavish; she re
ceives her old friends from America with
the California hospitality that was born
in her and has not been educated out oC
her. But she has been Mme. Terry, no|}
"the California Nightingale" and thQ
"American Songbird Sorceress" as of old.
They had toen married just a year
when she was left a widow. She found
herself owner of a splendid gift, provided
she should not marry again. There was
where Terry's Cuban jealousy came in.
He had always watched her like a cat and
had never been sure whether it was more
pleasure or misery to have a j charming
wife. --V
She promised him to leave the stage.
They went off for a wedding trip to Italy
and disappeared from public notice for a
while. The next thing they did to inter
est the world at large was to fall desper
ately sick, both of them. He threatened,
to go blind and she to become paralyzed.
In the end he died and she revived on the;
fortune he left her. ..
-Alone , and unhappy in Paris, she
brought suit for divorce. There were all
kinds of muddles over the cross suit: in
the end it was fixed so that she was free
to do as she pleased and Terry was di
vorced without the right to marry again.
This was most inconvenient for. him, and.
annoyed him a great deal for a while, but
as Mrs. Terry could do as she pleased
and what she pleased -was to die, the mat
ter -was settled pleasantly for him in the
end, and he and Sybil were quietly made
one in December of that year.
She went to Paris and. began to sue tot
divorce. By the way, she had been Grace
Dalton Seoor of New York â one of th4
foui hundred and the gayest of the gay.
Her charms for Terry, though, had
waned.
: Back in Paris her friends soothed her
troubled feelings and coaxed .her to; sing
to them once mere. But her first period
as an opera singer was drawing to a
close. It was in March, 1895, that she
sailed from New York; it was in June,
1S97, that â¢ a dispatch from England an
nounced her marriage on the Isle of Jer
sey. The message was false, but it was
an anticipation.
At Just that time little brown Tonio
Terry didn't â¢ know exactly what to do
with his wife. She was an embarrass
ment to him and , considerably hindered
his marriage with Miss Sanderson. She
had been in his way for a long time and
had hindered at least five other marriages
that he had contemplated. The previous
one had been with Sadie Martinot, who
v/as last seen here under the wing of
Henry Miller. But when Sybil dawned on
his horizon Sadie was seen through the
big end of the glass. She has been called
portly, but she wasn't to be found with a
microscope after he had cast his eyes oa
Sybil's charms. This time he really felt
it a personal grievance that his wife exÂ«
isted. i Â¦. Â¦ Â¦ â¢
For years she remained a favorite
abroad. At last she was induced by the
same American jingle which has induced
all the European singers to come to
America. She sang a brief season -in New
York, was a failure and returned to
Paris saying all kinds .of horrid , things
about us this side the pond and vowing:
that she never would return. California \
despaired of ever hearing her again. ;
Paris, Berlin. Vienna and St. Petersburg
were at her feet before long. Massenet
had written "Esclarmonde" for her: Saint-
Saens had written "Phryne." The latter
was most popular, as its Grecian cos
tumes and difficult scores displayed both
Sybil and her voice to great advantage.
She became identified with the opera, and
is to this day best known in connection
with it.
she was allowed to gTve up her time to
musicâ that, is, what time she had. Her
love affairs were beginning to take up
most of her time.
She was developing a wonderful voice,
which she used for, light musicâ such as
would be ragtime nowadays. Classical
opera was still unknown to her.
There are those to be found who claim
to have inspired Sybil Sanderson to go on
the operatic stage. ' It is likely thai she
inspired herself, if the truth were known.
She . has never shown, any tendency, to
take advice. However, there were plenty
who, advised her to try a "career." as
well as-plenty who advised sweet domes
ticity, and the former are eager to prove
that they are responsible for a world
famous soprano. j Â¦
She had thlnss pretty much her own
way musically from the time she went
abroad. She was barely a young lady
then, just coming to the fullness of 'her
beauty. Â¦ It was the type of beauty to
send shivers up and down a Parisian
spine,, and thiÂ« fact, coupled with the
rareness- of .. her . voice,- guaranteed her
quick success. . Â¦; Â¦ Â¦ : 'Â¦-.-. .. Â¦
Musicians went daffy over her. 'â She was
everybody's protege. Her adoring masters
could hardly wait for her debut.
Massenet was the one chiefly Identified
with her career. He was both teacher
and composerâ he was both . to her. He
dreamed of the time when the "California
Nightingale" should warble his scores.
The time came. He -raved, Paris raved.
Europe raved.
fections with her. Great musicians have
Â¦written operas for her voice. Royalty
has sought her favor. .; She has played
with famous men, â¢wealthy men, powerful
men. as if they were on. a chess board.
She may stir matters when, she returns :
to her native State. '.â¢â¢:..
Rumor has it that she has run through
her money, 'which was the .money of
â¢Tonio Terry. 'Tonlo was the son of To
xnasco Terry, you recollect, or old Tom
Terry as he was before he ceased being
a son of Erin and became a Cuban plant
er. 'Tonio's share of old .To:* T s estate,
after it had been divided. aino4' six, was
a round $10,000,000 and a life interest in
one-half the fortune went to his widow.
It is nevertheless quite conceivable that
by this time the mourned gentleman
having been dead almjbst three years, she
should find herself on her uppers. This
is only rumored. ..Â¦Â¦â¢.
Sybil's wardrobe used to have the repu
tation of outshining that. : of any pnma
donna of all history. ; â¢ . V V -'.'- - â¢ Â¦
â¢ Whether for this reason or 'some other,
at any rate she has been singing in light
opera this season since her return to the
stage. She had given it up for good and
all. so her husband believed. So he or
dered. But be was not able to remain to
Eee that his orders were carried out, and
either because the money bags were
empty or because the old fascination could
not be resisted, she went to singing again.
And now there are those who say that the
Terry family will have something to say
about the provisions of the will, inasmuch
as Sybil is not fulfilling 'her part of the
marriage contract. v ,
But Sybil Sanderson has made a spe
cialty all her life long of understanding
her business, and it is not likely that she
Â¦ is different now. She has always known
what she wanted and has got it. The pub
lic's curiosity is a compliment to her, but
it is a waste of time.
As for getting what she wantsâ she be
gan the practice when she was very
young and lived in San Francisco. She
had a horse because she wanted it, she
had another because she wanted it. she
had a piano and gowns and journeys. She
likewise had teachers whom she didn't
want and made no bones of telling them
- eo. She was too busy having fun to study
anything but music.
"Bright and sharp as a new tack," they
eay, "but a. sinner."
After wearing out several private teach
ers and several more in the public schools
She has found plenty to share these af-
ing her keep on -with her lessons?* she
would ask me in despair."../ -'
Except from her music teachers all re
ports are similar. Sybil seeins always to
have had two strong affections â for her
â¢art and for her charming self.
f>a YBIL Is coming back. - -
\q. It Is the unexpected that is about
y^J to happen. For she said she
f^_-* wouldn't, always, wouldn't, return
A. to America. She made it very plain
that she wouldn't play In our yard. She
6aid she didn't like us. We had slighted
her. We had abused her. We didn't
know music from the cackling on a hen
roost. She bad had enough of us.
And now, voluntarily, she is coming
back.
She has made up her own quarrel- to
suit herself, has decided to forgive and
forget, and we shall hear her sing in San
Francisco when Mr. Grau opens his sea
son here. Grau happens to be the posse's-
Bor of an excellent bank account, and this
may have something to do with Sybil's
forgiveness. * '. â¢
She has never sung in San Francisco
since ehe first left here, before the days
of her name and fame, to study abroad.
ShÂ« has tried herself on New York once
during that time, and a sorry frost arose.
That is why she decided to hate America.
Naturally San Francisco has some cu
riosity to see and hear the lady. She

Â¦who went to school -with her. There are
those who taught her, or tried to. There
are those who played with her. those who

Bybll Is much and variously remembered.
TnÂ« fair Sybil was fain to pose as a
lovely devil and was Immensely displeased
if any one doubted her right to the title.
There were prudish mammas who told
their little girls to say they had a cold
and must remain indoors when Sybil
granted them to come play with her.
Sybil hac always found the world full of

TO THE EXCOMMUNICATION OF THE HOLY SYNOD.
"Exactlvj and I eay what I feel, that's all."
eai-a Raines, airily. "But seriously, officer,
is a valuable thing like this quite safe in a
case that?"
"Safe 'enough as long as I'm here." replied
the other, between sxim jest and stout earnest.
"I didn't Bay as I was, sir." replied the
r>oliceman. "But that's queer talk for a gen
tleman like you, eir, in the British Museum!"
And he wagged his, helmet at my invalid, who
had taken his airing in frock coat and top
hat. the more readily to assume his present
part. . .
. "What!" cried Raffles, "simply saying to
my friend that I'd like to lift the gold cup?
Why. so I should, officer, so I should! I don't
mind who hears_.me eay so. It's one of the
most beautiful things that I ever saw in all

The constable's face had already relaxed, and
now a grin peeped under the limp mustache.
"I daresay there's many as feels like that,
dr." said he.
Then R?.f5<?s gets it into his head that
he must have a try for a very valuable
cup recently presented to the British Mu
seum. Bunny is the same old Bunny. He
Is a thief out and out. but still lie hatea
the life. He is still, as Raffles considers
him. the same dear old stupid pal that
sees nothing in advance and is of the
greatest assistance when the coup Is
ready to be played, for by his innocence
he deceives the victims. Raffles, as usual,
purposely misleads Bunny into the belief
that his Intentions are honest upon his
first visit to the museum and so Bunny
accompanies him with care-free mind.
Bunny himself does not know that the
robbery is to be done until it is all over â
but that is Raffles as he always Is. Here
is the account as Mr. Hornung gives it:
The thine had a little equare case of plate
glass all to Jtself at one end of the room. It'
may have been the thing of beauty that Raf
fles effected to consider !t. but I for my part
was in no mood to look at it In that light.
Undernf-ath were the names of the plutocrats
who had subscribed for this national gewguw,
and I fell to wondering: where their Â£8000
came In. while Raffles devoured his two-penny
guide book as greedily as a Fchoolgirl with a
zeal for culture.
"Those are scenes from the martyrdom of'
St. Agnes," s&id he â¢ â¢ â¢ " 'translucent on
relief â¢ â¢ â¢ one of the finest specimens of
its kind.' I should think It was! Bunny, you
Philistine, why can't you admire the thins
for Its ovn sake? It would be worth havtnc
only to live up to! There never was such rich
enameling on such thin gold: and what a good
scheme to hang the lid up over it. bo that
you can see how thin it is. I wonder : if we
could lift it. Bunny, by hock or crook?
"You'd better try. sir." said a dry voice at
his elbow.
The madman eeemed to think we had the
rcom to ourselves. I knew better. '. but. Â¦ like
another madman, had let him ramble on un
checked. And here was a Etolld constable
confronting: us. in the short tunic that they
wear in summer. hU whistle on its chain, but
no truncheon at his Bide. Heavens! how I
see him now; a man of medium size, with a
broad, good-humored, perspiring face and a
limp mustache. He looked sternly at Raffles
and Raffles looked merrily at him. . â¢ -. ,
"Going tc run me in, officer?" said he. "Tl:at
would be a jokeâ my hat!"
The first effort of the pair is directed at
replenishing- their pocketbooks, and they
cleverly swindle a jeweler out of several
thousand dollars' worth of. gems.
Between the different' periods of the two
books Bunny has '.served his term In
prison for his first offenses, and Rafflea,
after his escape in the Mediterranean, has
had enough experience to turn his hair
white. Even with this change in his ap
pearance he does not. dare show himself
except with the greatest : caution..
Rallies is now a man with white hair
and poses under the name of Matutin. an
invalid of meansâ his old idea of having
"an alternative profession." By a clever
bit of advertising he gets on the track of
Bunny and brings -iiim once more to his
side. â¢ Â¦Â¦ . â¢ ;
.Mr. Hornung's latest book, which he
calls "Raffles," is a further account of
Â¦ that gentleman's career from the time of
his swim, in the sunset sea until he finally
drops crime to fight for his Quen in South
Africa.
..'; If . 'you did not read "The Amateur
Cracksman," very well; read "Raffles,"
for this last book is complete in itself and
references to the first are sufficiently ex
plained." : - Eut one thing is certain. After
you have read "Raffles" you will not rest
until you have a copy of "The Amateur
Cracksman" in your hands, so you might
as", well begin at the beginning and get a
copy of the "Cracksman" firstâ then take
"Raffles."-':
This second series of adventures Is even
more remarkable than the first. The
author brings about the- meeting of Raf
fles and his old friend Bunny in the most
novel. and approved style of mystery, and
poon they are hard at work at their old
game of living off the world.
It seems that after all Raffles did not die

Mechanically I did &s I was told. There was
no time" for thought, etlll lesB for remonstrance
or reproach, though my surprise must have
been even more complete than that of the con
stable before Raffles knocked the senss out of
him. Even in my utter bewilderment, how
ever, the instinctive caution of the real crim
inal did not desert me. I ran to the door, but
I sauntered through it, to plant myself before
a Pompeilan fresco in the corridor, and there
were the two attendants still gossiping out
side the further door, nor did they hear th<*
dull crash which I heard even as I watched
them out of the corner of each t eye.
It was hot weather, as I have said, but the
perspiration on my body seemed already to
have turned Into a skin of Ice. Then I caught
the faint reflection of my own face in' the cas
ing of the fresco, and it frightened me into
some semblance of myself as Raffles joined ma
with his hands in his pockets. But my fear
and indignation were doubled at tho sight of
him. when a single glance convinced me that
his pockets were as empty as his hands, and
his mad outrage the most wanton and recklebs
oX his whole career. . . â¢ Â¦

"We!" I whispered. "We!"\

must needs interrupt them to ask the way to
the Prehistoric Saloon:
"At the top of the stairs."
Â¦ "Thank you. Then we'll work round, that
way to the Egyptian part."
And we left them resuming their providential
chat.
"I believe you're mad," I said; bitterly, as
we went.
"I believe I was," admitted Raffles, "but
I'm not now, and I'll see you through. A hun
dred and thirty-nine yards, wasn't it? Then
It can't be more than a hundred and twenty
nowâ not as much. Steady, Bunny, for God's
sake. It's slow march â for our lives." â¢Â¦''.. '
There was this much management. The rest
was our colossal luck. A hansom was being
paid off at the foot of the steps outside, and

Cross!" for all Bloomsbury to hear.'
We- had ttrned into Bloomsbury street without
exchanging a syllable when' he struck the trap

"Where the devil are you driving us?"
"Charing Cross, sir.'.' Â¦'
"I said King's Cross. Round you spin and
drive like blaze?, or we miss our train! There's
one to York at 10:25," added Raffles as the
trap door slammed; "we'll book there. Bunny,
. and then we'll slope through the subway to.
the Metropolitan, and so to ground via Baker
street and Earl's Court." '
And actually in half an hour he was seated
' once more in the hired carrying chair, while
â¢ the porter and I staggered upstairs with my
decrepit charge, for whose shattered strength
even one hour in Kew<Gardens had proved too
much! Then, and not until , then, when we
had got rid of . the porter and were alone at
last, Â«ll<i I tell . Raffles, in the most nervous
English at my command, frankly, and exactly,
what I thought of him and of his latest deod.'.
Once started, moreover, I spoke. as I have sel
dom spoken to living man; and Raffles, of. all -
men. stood my abuse without a murmur;. or
rather he sat it out. too astounded even to take
off his hat. though I thought his eyebrows
would have lifted it from his head.
"But it was always your infernal way." I
was savagely concluding. "You make one plan
and you tell me another ."
"Not to-day. Bunny, I.sw.ear!"
"You mean to tell me you" really did start
with the bare idea of finding a place to hide
In for a night?"
"Of course I did."
"It was to be the mere reconnoiter you pre
tended?"- . . . :..-â¢. â¢
"There was no pretense about It* Bunny.!'
"Then why on earth go and do what you
did ?" , :
ThÂ« reason would be obvious to .any one but
you." said Raffles, still with no unkindly scorn.
"It was the temptation of a minuteâ the final
Impulse of the fraction of a second, . when
Roberto saw that I was tempted. ; and let me
sea that he saw it. It's not a thing I care to
do{ and I shan't be happy until the papers tell
me the poor devil is alive. But a knockout
shot was the only chance for us then."
"Why, you don't get run in for being tempt- .

"But I should have deserved running in If
I had not yielded to such a temptation as that.

was an attendant Just outside, but he sounds
to me as though he were at the other end of
the corridor. I shall write to-day!"
For r.n tnetant we all three listened, and
Raffles was right. Then I saw two things in
one glance. Raffles had stepped a few inches
backward and stood poised upon the ball of
each foot, his arms half raised, a light in his
eyes. And another kind of light was breaking
over the crass features of our friend the con
stable. '
"Then shall I tell you what I'll do?" he
cried, with a sudden clutch at - the whistle
chain on his chest. The whistle flew out. but
it never reached his lips. There were a couple
of sharp smacks, like double-barrels discharged
all but simultaneously, and the man reeled
against me so that I could not help catching
him aa he fell.
"Vfoll done, Bunny! I've knocked him outâ
I've knocked him out! Run you to the door
and pee if the attendants have heard anyth*lng

"Meanwhile, what if my friend and I had
been professional thieves? Why, we could have

"That you couidn't, leastways not without
bringing the whole place about your ears."

Just outside. In my own mind I even ques

Raffle*. '.
"That wasn't -a billiard cue! It was a

vouely. -"It ought to be a poleax! The pub

this. I shall write to the Times about It â you
see If I don't!"

Dill Wilson has retold the story
of Don Quixote. The wonderful adven
tures of the old Spanish knight-errant are
amusing to older heads, but children have
not always grasped Cervantes' style. The
story is here retold as simply as possible,
and cannot fail to please. The version
preserves all the incidents of the original
book, with the exception of a few minor
episodes that would not readily be under
stood. It.. relates the doughty deeds of
Don Quixote and Sancho Panzaâ the ' bat
tle with the sheep, the tilting with the
windmill, the slaying of the wine-skin
giant and all ;the absurd exploits which
have caused the world to laugh since they
were first narrated, some three hundred
years ago. The present volume is attrac
tive in design and make-up. It has an
illuminated cover and frontispiece,- and is
illustrated with full-page half-tones from
original drawings. , (Published by Thomas

A. M. Robertson. San Francisco, will
publish shortly a volume of poetry by
Lionel Josaphare. A few of the author a
poems have appeared In the magazines
and newspapers, and two were recently
published in a small book entitled The
Lion at the Well." This^ small book
caused a remarkable diversity of opinion
among the critics. Some scored the poem
with unmerciful sarcasm; a few expressed
their admiration and advised the reading
public to watch the name of Josaphare:
but, with few exceptions, all spoke of the
great strength, originality and imagina
tion of the verse. '
An opportunity is about to be given for
testing the latest work of the poet. The
new name la an aspirant for fame and
the highest honors of literature! The
forthcoming volume will cause much dis
cussion, as Mr. . Josaphare shows an in
crease upon the strength which was ac
knowledged in "The Lion at the Well."
Hy has at the same time rid himself of
the faults of unusual wording and erratic
figures which the critics deplored in the
earlier work, so that the new volume will
be rich in Its evidence of that which con
stitutes the best attainments of poetic
imagination with an adequate vigor of
expression.

AND THE FAMILY
AT THE EXPOSITION. Â¦ . J - â
The world's center Is ever moving close?
to. San Francisco and each time that
national or International delegates con
gregate herÂ© the importance of the fact
la Increased. The present convention will
be a Â¦ memorable one not only by reason
of the men who take part r id the topics
discussed, but everything points to ex
pansive efforts on the part of the church.
In keeping with those which, are movlna
the country, at large.
During, the convention it was planned
that- he should be domiciled in the Scott
house, where the President lived while
In 1893. He has been rector of many
churches In the East and professor of
church history at .Berkeley Divinity
School. He had already declined an
invitation election to the office of Blshon
TSXlZnl â¢Â° bef Â° re ; reCeWing that
remembered nn Imvlnsr tnkon original
mothorlH of working among tho poor.
Whenever ho heard of a fiimlly in wnnt
of food or MUffcrlng for clothing: /ho did
not waste time In vain, but went directly
to houses of lily parishioners whore ho
knew; ho whs sure to find round ronsttj
and fat fowls ready for the oven. Theso
ho would calmly nnd quietly put Into a
capacious basket, tuck In' plenty of trlm
fhlnga and relishes, with perhaps n few
more substantiate- if there was room for
thorn. Then, taking- Mmaelf to the house
where they were needed, he would leave
the basket with as little ostentation as
possible and go on, his way. Clothing
was obtained and distributed in the same
manner. The hint was so plain that It
Â¦was not Ions before cases were attended
to. before even he had a chance to hear
of them, and -to this uay there are those
that thank-hlm./ '
It was supposed when " the convention
was called. to meet here that there, would
be the greatest difficulty in getting- a
fair attendance, but the reverse, has been
the case, as there has been active rivalry
among the different ellgiblea to Â¦ secure
the position of delegates and manykwho
were not selected 'declare their, intention
of, coming as spectators,' and most" of
those who do- come '. will brine families
and friends.' . It will, be another, object
lesson, to the Easterners who ( think that
Calif ornians Â¦ wear ;' feathers - and " war
paint, . or red shirts j and cowhide boots,"
to find that. such an eminently peaceful*
couvocatioa ' can gather on the xar shores
of the Pacific with no more discomfort
than Wan Inland metropolis. â¢â¢
Bishop "William Ford Nichols of San
Francisco, to whom "so much credit la
due- for" bringing hither the convention,
has led a' busy life. Graduating at Trinity
College, Hartford, In 1870, he took hl3
degree of A.- M. in 1873 and D. k D. p In 1878,
was ordained deacon in 1873 and priest in -
1874/ was consecrated Bishop Coadjutor of
California, in, 1S00 ami Bishop .of. Caltfewiia
The Right Rev. Edgar Jacob, Lord
Bishop of Newcastle, who comes as the
personal- representative* of the Archbishop
of Canterbury, is another who is \ con
cerned in the question of. transfer of spir
itual Jurisdiction of the islands. He will
be the most notable figure among the vis
iting Bishops, for the reason that he is a
peer of the realmâ a spiritual peer, it is
trueâ but none the lessj a real lord.
Bishop Jacob Is the son of the archdea
con of Winchester, an Oxford man, and
was consecrated as successor of Bishon
Wilberforce. .
Between Bishops Jacob of Newcastle
Bo while tho polltlcul annexation of i ho
islands has been completed they are more
adrift than ever as far as spiritual af
nilatlons are concerned, being neither
English nor American. This has left the
entire burden of administration upon the
Right Reverend Lord Bishop himself, and'
tho result has been that he has been ac
cused by some who have disagreed with
him pt attempting to arrogate to himself
the power of a Pope, merely because he
had no superior. This Bishop Willis de
nies strenuously*, asserting that he is do
ing nothing more than his duty in at
tempting to hold together and preserve
the church, which has thus fallen between
two supports, until it is again picked up
and placed under the spiritual dominion
of one or the other of them. '
Another which has lightened the load
of many a parent is the parish store,
where second-hand garments are sent to
be sold at rates which make the cost of
clothing a family a matter of secondary
consideration. Schools of household econ
omy are also established by the parish,
where those who have never learned
kitchen economics are taught to make the
richest and most delicious dishes from tho
cheapest materials that the market af
fordu. To all Â«uch charities as tWs Pier
pont Morgan gives, and gives without
limit, except in to far as therw is needed
intelligence in the distribution, for he
cannot personally look after those de
tails. This is one of the great goods
which conies from tho centralization of
wealth and power; tho money is diverted
Into channels which lead only to the best.
Bishop I'otter of New York will have
many thincs of interest to tell tho con
vention, for he has made Â» trip to Hono
lulu, the Philippines and China for the
purpose of extending tho influence of tho
Episcopal church in our new possessions,
ond is ono of tho strongest advocates of
tho necessity of having the church follow
tho flag. During his trip he was presont
nt tho convention of clergymen of tho
Anglican church in tho Hawaiian Islands,
at which tima it was ngrocd that it wan
best for tho welfare of tho church thoro
to withdraw from tho Church of England
and place Itself under tho spiritual Juris
diction of. tho United States whenever It
receives an invitation to do so.
One of the practical charities which has
helped without causing them to lose in
dependence and self respect la the pur
chase of coal by shipload lots in the sum
mer, when it is cheap, and then retailing
it out to the poor parishioners by the
bucketful in the winter time at Just what
it cost, plus a low rate of Interest and
actual expense of handling.
In the parish of St. George in the East
side In New York there are many of the
unfortunate extreme poor who are des

The Episcopal church in New York has

loans entered upon a class of work which

that indiscriminate giving works more
harm than good and is always an injury

It has not been generally known before
that he has been gradually earning for
himself tho title of "the Angel of tho

him less than to have it known, for his
charity Is of the kind that balks at Im

Â¦ Nearly every Episcopal Bishop in Amer
ica will be present. Among them are
many men who have won themselves fame
by their writings aside from their work

of the questions which will bo decided has
made the attendance much greater than
was expected. Tho old question. of the
change of name, which has iiKuully boon

Prince, ex-Governor of New Mexico;
THE triennial convention of the Prot
estant Episcopal church of the
United States of America will have
some discussions which will surely
catch the popular car, for human
Interest that appeal* to every man and
woman pertains to dome of them, and to
others there is enough of political com
plexion to draw the attention of all who
watch the procress of the world that
moves. .
This body, which meets so seldom and
adjourns nine die. Is the fountain head of
power for the whole branch of the Epl*
copal church which had its beginning
when America separated from the mother
country. It is significant that among: tho
delegates to the llrnt convention, one hun
dred and twenty-five years ago, were
many of the men who signed the Declara
tion of Independence.
The men who are coming to discuss
these questions are even more Interesting:
than the subjects of debate. Foremost
among them from a popular standpoint
is J. Pierpont Morgan, the modern Alex
ander of the commercial world. It will bo
a new light In which to see him: this man
of millionaire affairs laying aside the vast
business that appals the earth with Us
magnitude and calmly listening to reports
of mlesions and Sunday schools for a
week at a time.
Morgan Is rapidly succeeding In rolling
the commercial world Into a unit Wheth
er he can In time so bring men's minds
to meet together that the churches shall
all unite In one Is a question which may
well be asked, for heretofore the reverse
process has been always in force and there
have been more divisions and offshootlngs
than coalescences.
The introduction of such forcible men
Into the councils of the church, men whose
every action along their path of life has
been marked by uninterrupted success,
cannot but aid In the practical work which
Is the necessary foundation for its pros- '
pcrlty.
During Morgan's stas* In San Francisco
he, with his family and guests, will take
possession of the old Charles Crocker man
sion on California street, the use of which
has been extended to him by the Crocker
Estate Company. It is probable that dur
ing the short time of Morgan's stay more
will bÂ© seen of the interior of the house
by San Franciscans than In many years
last past, as It has been secluded as a
tomb during the greater part of the time.
That much entertaining Is Intended is
shown by the fact that Sherry, the famous
New York caterer, who has officiated at
such notable affairs as the Bradley-Mar
tin ball, will be brought out to superin
tend the cuisine. This will -certainly be a
relief to Miss Morgan, who has, according
to reports of correspondents, been baking
her own flapjacks while on her present
hunting trip in the Rockies.
When J. Pierpont Morgan stops attend
ing to business and devotes himself to
religious affairs It is enough to make peo
ple look around.
When the Bishop of Shanghai and the
Bishop of Africa and Bishops from Japan,
Canada and England, together with sev
enty-flve other Bishops, come to San Fran
cisco to discuss with Mr. Morgan and
other laymen on such living questions as
"Shall innocent parties to a divorce bo
prevented from remarrying?" It Is an
Event.
Some other subjects which will be de
bated closely are of concern to the gen
eral public, as well as to church mem
bers. Among them Is one which has
crown Indirectly out of the Spanish war.
It Is, "Does tho church follow the flag?"
This would not have arisen under any
other circumstances the broad world over
except the present. . .
Bishop Potter of New York, who left a
life of luxury to go and live In the slums
that he might know what are the needs of
the poor, will be accommodated in the
Will Crocker house, which stands in the
corner of the homestead lot. Bishop Pot
ter is of a family of Bishops; his father
was Bishop Alonzo Potter of Pennsylva
nia and his uncle, Horatio Potter, pro
ceded him in office as Bishop of New
York.
From England there will comÂ© tho Right
Rev. E. Jacob, Bishop of Winchester, who
has been delegated by the Archbishop of
Canterbury to Â¦ officially represent tho
Church of England at this convention of
the American church.
Another delegate from the Church of
England, whose religion will perhaps ba
better classed if mated as being in a con
dition of metamorphosis, la Right Rev.
Alfred Willis, lord Bishop of Honolulu,
who was thera In chargo of the missions
of the Church of England. On the annex
ation of the islands to tho United States
the territory could manifestly no longer
be controlled by the Church of England,
which it more closely united with tho
state than Is consistent with existence un
der the Stars and Stripes.
Another class of foreign Bishops are
really American*, although they hall
from alien lands. The Bishop of Capo
Palmas, Africa, Is a representative of the
Protestant Episcopal church of the Unit
ed States, In chargo of the foreign mis
sions on the dawning continent; so. too,

American foreign missions and are Amer

I asked the general what the Filipino
woman was like, that the American girl
might form some opinion whether sha
could Americanize her or not.
"The Filipino women are not pretty,
perhaps,' but they are bright and Interest

"They always wear a decollete cown,
but most decorously and modestly con

necks and shoulders of all the women I

The Impression that General MacArthur
was a severe and stoical- man. similar in
some degree to General Kitchener, If it
ever existed, as I believe it did. is entirely
wrong. I have tried to make It clear that
as a man the major general Is not at all â¢

his report to Washington show him to bÂ«,

: "My position, commanding an occupying 1
army, was not the most auspicious to ob
serve the social side of the Filipinos. We
naturally regarded them at Arst with sus

"Do they take kindly to the form of

partment, must ' exert an active . and po

influence of an American army. If a
spirit of Philippine speculation should

"As a matter of fact, having reference
to the present and immediate future, it is
not apparent how political control of the
archipelago is to bring sudden and large
additions to the national 'wealth of the
"United States," he wrote to the depart
ment in Washington. .

"What' do you consider are the commer

"We shall like these people?" I asked.
"When the; American public learns to
know the Filipinos I think these little peo
ple will become very popular with us. They
are impulsive, generous and always cour
teous. They have a ready wit, also, which
is most solemnly delivered. A distinguished
Filipino, while in ' conversation with an
eminent American officer in Manila,
showed this faculty very keenly. The offi
cer said to him: 'You are a queer sort of
people. You . leave all your families in
Manila, under the protection of the Amer

" 'I am permeated with the atmosphere
of European Cabinets. I therefore am pre

The general laughed heartily as he re
called this incident, for the humor of it
to the American mind was its affectation
of self-importance.
"There is a vast difference between lib
erty and independence," said, the general,
"and the trouble was that in the language
of the Filipinos liberty was translated as
Independence. Now, independence may
represent a government of absolute ty

yond the harmonic poise that is acquired
in the service, the instincts of a gentle
man. We all know what that quality in
volves, the relationships it can establish,
the dignity it entails and exacts. The
training of an army man is intended to
develop the best that Is in him. Some
times it does, and sometimes it does not.
There are all kinds, all sorts and condi
tions of men in every service, but the best
executive quality in a man is integrity of
purpose toward his fellow man, white or
black, and that quality is distinctively
General MacArthur's.
A first impression of the general is his
amiability; then he becomes crisp, direct,
clear and penetrating in his observations,
in which crops out an iron force of firm
ness almost Bevere when one considers his
strong, sauare Jaw and his set lips, but
there is always a kindliness in his eyes

have seen a man who is a fine type of

There was a great deal talked over dur

general. We touched upon the Aguinalde
capture, the discretion of General Funs

above all. the nature of those little people

His Amiability.
General MacArthur is a diplomat. The
There can be no doubt that so careful a
soldier and so intelligent a military gov
ernor as Major General MaeArthur exam
ined and closely considered the rights un
der the laws of war by which the capture
of Ajpitnaldo was effected, and therefore
every detail i>f that expedition has its
legitimate authority. But the general has
less vanity than is Usually permissible in
commanding 1 officers, and therefore in his
report General Funston becomes the cen
tral figure of the Aguinaldo capture.
A great deal of the delay toward the
pacification of the islands has been caused
by the difficulty of transplanting Into the
Filipino. langruage the actual policy of the
administration in the Philippines.
"Persons residing within an occupied
place who do things inimical to the inter
ests of the occupying 1 army are known. as
war rebels," General MacArthur wrote In
his proclamation to , the people of the
archipelago explaining to them the laws
of war. This proclamation enlightened
conditions that had previously been bar
baric. In some respects this proclama
tion was a humanitarian instrument un
surpassed by any effort of its special
character to make a foreign people un
derstand the restrictive motives of an oc
cupying army. One of the concluding sen
tences in this proclamation reflects tht
"All the personal distinction which nat
urally attaches to successful execution
must go to General Furhton, who on this,
as on former occasions, displayed so mucn
fortitude, determination, good judgment,
self-contidence and self-control as to jus
tify the expectation that his future ca
reer in conducting operations on a larger
scale will be attended with like success
ful results."

"Funbton has got his rewardâ a general
officer at 3.1 a.nd a career bfifof! him,"
said General MucArthur, when 1 asÂ«v*?d
him for a personal impression of the man.
Although General MacArinur preferred
r.ot to be quoted on many things that
transpired during the Funston expedition,
of which we talked a great deal, it is no
breach of conn Jem e to state, what is gen
erally known in Â¦ the army, that General
Kunston is net a swashbuckling soldier or
a wildly adventurous one. He: Is a uni
versity man, whose record has been clear
of entanglements. He was probably se
lected to command the expedition because
the discovery of the exact location of
Aguinaldo's camp occurred through the
capture ol a letter written by Aguinaldo
to one of his officers, which revealed the
information required. This letter was in
tercepted by one of Funston's lieutenants
and reached headquarters in the due
course of military routine. In- his report
General MaeArthur said:

And as for that, she. has danced In pub-

year line. A story is told of how her little
dance in "Cyrano de Bergerac" came to
be introduced. There was not the flight-
est idea of It at first. During one of the
rehearsals when she,' the duenna of Utie '
piece, was standing in an obscure corner
she commenced beating time softly to the
Inspiring music incidental to,the scene.
and presently found herself dancing away
gayly, unnoticed as she supposed. But
Ada Rehan's quick.eye.caught her at It,
Ada Rehan told, and presently she roused
to find' Miss Rehan, - Daly and Charles
Richman all looking delightedly and af
fectionately on.
"Good for you, grandma," Daly cried.,
"Try that business over again." "'-
And he had the dance rehearsed until
it was letter-perfect," insisting that It be
part of the regular-performance.- : r
To\so* back to her. early dancing days,
she married during them! and while still
an English'woman she toured England
with her husband. It was in 1849 that she
came to America, and from that time on
has been thoroughly American in feeling,
apologizing most humbly for her English
birth.': ,, / ;
She and her husband went West upon
their arrival in New York, and for a long
time they played in Wisconsin, Illinois
and Ohio.
Mrs. .Gilbert has avast amount, of ex
perience in whatsis now being revived un
der the -name of "stock star" work.. She
belonged to a stock company which, re
mained ; at one theater to support travel
ing stars. In this work she had to play
every conceivable kind of 1 role, and she
got the broad and thorough training- that
time, as well as other stars whose names
have come down to us. , They would. stop
in the town for a week or perhaps less;
this made hard work for the stock com
pany, for there was constant cramming
of parts to be kept up. Mrs. Gilbert had
to, study and play everything from; light
farces to Shakespeare.
She, claims that her first hit was in the
little dance of the "Dromajah" in "Poca

hop, skip and a jump as she left the stage

her own ideas along that line, but she
does not obtrude them, a:nd ; she adapts
herself most charmingly to the wishes of
the present generation. . - y' ' Â¦Â¦Â¦':
She is 80 years old now â so 'delightfully
old, in fact,* that it becomes Â£ tribute in
stead of an impudence to name her age.
And she attributes her advanced years to
the fact that she was reared a dancer.
This seems to be a new theory on an
old Question. Mrs. Gilbert repeats: 'Â¦. â¢
"I attribute to my early training, as a
dancer my fine health, high spirits' and
long life." .. -' - -?' : . â¢Â¦
There is an idea worth digesting. Per
haps the people of the ballet, whom we
have been in the habit of. sentimentally
pitying for their long hours upon their â¢
weary toesâ perhaps they will have the
laugh on us In the end. Perhaps their .
toes will be still in good form when we
have turned ours up. At any rate, Mrs. Â¦
Gilbert ought to know whereof she speaks,
for at 80 she is talking of her career in the
present and future tense. ( ' â¢'. v
"Th5s is a charming play we are piitV
ting on now, don't you think so?" she
sayB. "Beautiful and pure. When we re

ing a new one. I don't know what it is
yet, but I am eager to see it. I shall be
with Miss Russell right alongâ yes, indeed
âfor a Ions time, I hope."
t When Mrs. Gilbert theorizes on old age
she always cites Taglioni, the famous
dancer and dancing master. He lived to
be over 80. He was one of her teachers
when, as a little child, she was practicing
"at the bar." -
This all too* place in England in the
Ballet School of Her Majesty's in the
Haymarket. This was the old Her Maj
esty's Tteater that stood on the ground
where Beerbohm Tree's Theater now
stands. She used to go on the stage there,
helping out as a "supe" and receiving her
pay in lessons at the school. She was a
little girl of 12 then, In company with a
lot of other little girls who worked and
studied in the same way that she did.
It was really her own will anfl against
much opposition that she went on the
stage. Her family were English and of
the conservative English type. It shows
what a little tyrant she must have been
at home, cr what a coaxer, that she had
her own way in the end and became &
professional dancer just as she wanted to.
She had to keep on with certain house

Mrs. Gilbert's seventieth birthday was
celebrated by Daly and the rest of the
company. His theater had become home
to her, bereaved as she was. When ha
died in 1899 she felt as if. cast adrift from
well known moorings. Frohman sent for
her then and she accepted the engagement

A.s the train pulled out, the window
where Mrs. Gilbert sat passed his door.
She nodded and smiled as she passed. To
her surprise he sprang from his seat, seiz
ing the flowers as he did so. With, great
strides he ran after the train,' reaching it
just in time to fling the flowers in at the
rear door. "They're for the old lady," he
cried.
They made the only bright spot In the>
whole dingy picture, and everybody in thÂ«
car noticed them. Half a dozen pretty,
women poked their heads out of aa many '
windows and begged for them. They were
all young, all charming, in f acty they
Â¦were some of Daly's stage beauties. But
the desolate miner was pro'of against their
wiles, far more than any Johnnie who
should be better used to them. He shook
his head stolidly.
"When he met "toe in the wins* ha
didn't say anything about what I had
done, but he stooped and kissed me and
said, 'God bless you, grandma," " she saya
when Phe tells the story. <
Mrs. Gilbert still treasures some Cali
fornia flowers that she pressed long ago.
She got them Just as she was leaving th*
'coast after one of Daly's visits here. The
train stopped in a grimy spot, a desolate
bit of the State, where one cabin was tha
only building in sight. The miner sat at
his door and near him, inside, was a tabla
on 'which stood a bunch of gorgeous Cali
fornia -wild flowers.
There is a pretty story, told of her on
one of her visits to San Francisco. It
was Drew*s last season with Daly, .when
he had already announced his Intention to
star and Daly was making things as dis
agreeable as possible for him. He allowed
him to take no calls for himself, no mat
ter -what the audience wanted. On his
last night in this city I>aly had left for
the East. The audience called the curtain
up again and again, and it was very evi
dent that "it was Drew they wanted, to
clap a farewell to him, and they would
tiot be satisfied with the repeated 'returns
of the whole company. But Daly was
Implicitly obeyed, whether he was present
or not, and Drew must have somebody
to'return with him. Finally MtC Gilbert
offered herself, hastily buttoning her
dress, which she had loosened preparatory
to dressing for the next act. She hurried
upon the stage with him. then patting his
hand in view of the audience, withdrew
and left him alone to his curtain call, his
by rights.
Ada Rehan and John J3rew held sway
there together, and later on. when Charles

.J<~ <Â¦â¢ X Tuesday, under the -law, the
1 Â¦"Â¦: 1- clbse. season for ducks and quail
1 I ends in the majority of counties.
Sportsmen have been making
: their preparations for weeks in
anticipation of the opening of the season
and all predict great shooting.
It is many years since quail have been
so numerous. In fact farmers are com
plaining of the damage they are doiiis
growing crops and are eagerly awaiting
the arrival of the men who will thin out
this most beautiful of game birds. Sev
eral reasons are offered for the marked
increase of the birds this year. Chief of
these is the fact that all the conditions
for breeding were good. Again they have
been â¢well preserved. This also holds good
of ducks as there has been an unusual
observance of the close season. A strong
sentiment in favor of the close season,
quickened in part by the arrest of some
violators, has strengthened this observ
ance.
Quail are to be fcund in great numbers
in San Benito, Monterey, Sacramento, San
*Joaquin and Mann counties, while Ihe
Suisun marshes are full of ducks. The
season for quail in Mann County will not
open until October 15, under a county
ordinance. The members of the Tamal
pais Sportsmen's Club have petitioned the
Supervisors to amend their ordinance
relative to the killing of quail and make It
conform to the State law.
Over in Alameda County the season for
quail will not open until November 1. Sec
tion 3 of an ordinance there reads:
Every person who. in the county of Ala
meda, State of California, between the 1st
day of February and the 1st day of Jfo
vember in each year, shall hunt, kill or
destroy or have in his possession any val
ley quail, bob white* or partridge, shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor.
Herman Oelrichs has acquired the pre
serve of the Tule Belle Club near Cor
delia. He and such Quests as he may wish
to entertain will thus have the excluHiva
The number of shooting clubs having
well kept preserves has greatly increased
since laBt season. New shooting boxes
have been built and old ones remodeled
on the majority of preserves. 'Â¦*,"'.'
The opponents to these views' say noth
ing is gained by the season ] being open
during February, as the canvasbacks by
that time, although unusually numerous,
are not edible, having taken to- salt water,
which destroys their flavor.
They affirm that October is too early,
as the canvasbacks do not begin to ar-r
rive- until the end of the month, being the
last species of birds to come down from
the north. It is also held that October be
ing a comparatively warm month birds
spoil before they reach the table. . . i
There is a general discussion going on
regarding the close season for ducks. The
law fixes it from October 1' to February
X. Some sportsmen Â¦ hold that it should
open and close a month later. .;
The State law fixes a bag limit of fifty,
ducks and twenty-five quaij. The latter
cannot be sold in market. The law Is
strict as to the bap. A- man cannot hava
more than fifty in his possession in any
pne day. He cannot bring home a bag
gathered in two days" shooting which ex
ceeds, the game limit, nor can. he bring
birds shot by a friend if the total is
more than fifty. In shipping by express
the name and address of the shipper must
be attached and the birds packed "in
open view." Birds shipped "in a sack are
accepted as complying Â¦with the latter pro
vision. The express companies are strict
in their observance of the laws and de
cline to ship any illegal game.

similar conditions. The 'winner' of any

must.be won three times to. become the

. which some "of the contestants re

produce many of the same results as
euchre and bridge whist parties, which
Eome little time ago. became a byword in
the community. All sorts of- little tricks
are played to secure big handicaps, and
golf, instead of being a healthful recrea
tion and productive of a.' wholesome riv
alry, becomes a scramble for cupa, and
the links a pothunter's paradise. Many
golfers think that it^will be much better
to have medals for" club championship
contests, the winner, to receive a -replica

Â¦'Â¦ BERKELEY, Sept. 28.â California's
football men have settled down to the
heavy work which must precede the big
game, now less than two months away.
The first, second and freshmen elevens
are being matched against each other for
vigorous plays. Line-ups continue to
change for tryout purposes and to keep
the ; men from overwork. Among those
who play on the first eleven and their pu- \
sltlons are the following:
Gendottl, " center; Hendricks, right
guard; Hansen, right tackle; Womblo
(captain), right end; Stowe, left guard;
Albertson, left tackle: Dlbblee. left end;
More, quarter; "Whlpple,- right half ; Mini.
left half; Duden and Sherman, full.
Overall may play for full or a line posi
ttap. Williams does , good work on tnÂ«
The men of the big eleven will assemble
at training table Monday at the College
Dining' Association rooms. No house for
the squad will be kept. The men will
lodge where they please, but their meals
will be taken together. Smoking haa long
since been stopped in the entire squad.
The track athletes are preparing for an
interclass meet to be- held on the cinder
path during the latter part of next month.
Behind the line Captain Fisher, Slaker,
Hill, "Pie" Smith, Parker, Allen, Raltt
and Bansbach form as good an aggrega
tion as Stanford has had to choose from
for several years. Slaker, Smith and
Fisher are fast; Hill is heavy and a good
punter, and at quarter Raltt and Bans
bach showed their ability in -the gams
last Thanksgiving day.
earnest, -about sixty men appearing
nightly in canvas and headgear. During
last week the men were engaged In punt
ing, catching, falling on the ball, running
through signals and developing speed and.
endurance. Two elevens of candidates for
the big team have been lining up dally
since Monday for a few minutes only
each afternoon, as the physical condition
of the men at present will not permit oC
hard practice. ' '
There are several candidates for nearly
every position. At center R. J. McFad
den '04, who played on last year's team;
C. D. Hauverman, tackle on the second,
eleven last year, and Carl Hayden, who
gave Lee a close rub for the position in
1899, are making an interesting fight.
Thompson . and Barnheisel, the star
guards on last year's second team, who
were considered by many the equals of
the big men, are out for their old posi
tions again. Horan,. who played on the
Lafayette eleven against Princeton. Cor
nell, Pennsylvania and other big teams,
has entered the race also and will un
doubtedly make the other candidates
work hard for the position. Traeger, who
won the last Thanksgiving game for
Stanford, is putting up his usual star
game at left tackle. Cooper, who won hla
"S" last fall, and Luck, substitute end
last year, are showing well. There will
be several freshmen in the race after thÂ»
freshman game en October 19, notably
among them Sefton, who played end on
the Belmont School team last year.

EVERY year as the days become :
shorter- there" is a noticeable " de
crease in the attendance at the lo
. cal tennis courts. This year, the
contrary is the case, the courts being busy
from morning until y' night. â¢ The park
courts have proved, an immense success.
It has become necessary to limit the time
of play of each match to one hour. It has
also . become necessary to build more
courts, and besides the five already down
three new ones are fast nearing compler
tion. â¢ * - ; " '>Â¦'.'.'â¢ \ i',' K \
Tennis players are watching the con
struction of these courts with considera
ble interest, 'as their success will mean a
considerable saving; in the building Â¦ of
courts in - the future". ' These courts differ
from the ones already in use in that they
are being packed with oil. If properly
oiled and rolled these â¢courts should be as
fast and true as asphalt courts, and the
wear and* tear on balls and shoes would be
greatly lessened. If the. oil does not prove
to 'be ..slippery I' the -other courts in the
park- will be built on this plan. Oiled
courts would require but little care, and in
wet weather would, dry in a short time."
Should'these courtsprove satisfactory" in
every,, way the, expense of building tennis
courts would be cut down to. about one
fifth of what it is at the present time. .
Several ladles who put in their morn
ings on the park courts have been at
tracting considerable attention of late.
These ladiesâ three in number â play fully
as well as the best ladles in the Califor
nia Tennis Club, and have a much -better
style than the latter. Their serving â¢ and
ground strokes are accurate . and possess
a great deal of speed. â¢
Muchlbetter results would be obtained

â¢*â¢ carnival have not yet been, reached,
. but already the cry against Califor
nia hounds has been heard. . Not that the
coursers from the coast are not welcome,
for the Missouri officials have admitted
that the entering of the fast dogs frdm
the /'.homo of coursing in America has
given the big stake great' prestige. In
acknowledging the worth, and the stand
ing of the invaders the owners of dogs in
the Middle States feel that their nomina
tions should be allowed some sort of
handicap in' competing' with the superior
greyhounds from the" West. A suggestion
that a special stake" for California hounds
be drawn was cried down, because, as
some: one saii, California dogs would
carry. away 1 enough, and if special events
were in order' they might be'made conso
lation: stakes, in which the home dog
could at least have a chance.
The Judging at St. Louis, has been far
from satisfactory. " From criticisms pub
lished in the papers it has detracted from
the pleasure of the meeting. In comment
ing on the decisions one writer says:
,] It "is not- easy to Judge a course from the
stand, hence criticism of a Judge by the spec
tators is not .always well taken. Yet Judge
Smith made such poor' use of his horse that it
seemed he might as well be in the stand as on
the field. ;â¢

Turquoise declared ?Â£ the winner. Turquoise
clearly won. but once a flag goes up it should

I the fact 'that the' wrong flag had-. been hoisted

; ' Instead of giving the telegram to the
boy for. delivery I purposely took it with
a great gesticulation and held it under
the table ,ou* of sight. Then I assumed
a thcatrlca! pose.. stared at the wire over
head, waved with my right" hand and be
gan" to work the key." , !
The buzz at the window increased' to a
murmur and then passed to an excited
roar from those who could not see,- but
knew that the spirits were about to work.
In a second the crowd knew as one. man
that a yellow envelope with the message
was about-to-be sent over. the Â¦â¢wire." Only
an instant and the ; windows were vacant
âeverybody was tumbling over his neigh
bor to get a look at the phenomenon of a
yellow envelope flying over the wires that
left the side of the building. <
There was an expectant hush. ThÂ«n
somebody yelled: -
"There she goes!"
"No, ebe didn't. I've had my eyÂ© on
that wire for ten minutes." ,
A. second, of silence and , the burst of
laughter from .the inside of the office tola
| them ' that there was'ajoko; somewhere,
and the show was either over or had not
'begun.'
As. they had- failed : . to- see the message
pats along the v;ire their second supposl
t'.rn was that the. wire must be hollow
and the envelope . had been> rolled up un
der the table and shot , through to San
Francisco. Everybody wanted to look at
â¢ the end of -the wire, and after finding that
their second guess was wrong they gave
it tip... .. ;
There was only, one solution. The tele-
. graph was" an enchanted spirit of some
kind. I I was a Wizard. The whole thing
was uncanny. It might blow, up at any
. minute, and the best thing to do was to
keep away f rom - something that no onÂ©

After finishing at San Jose we made ar
.rangements to push the work on to Stock-'

run was larger, than that used before and
would not work so well on our reel. Thai
first day we were able to make only thre^.
miles, and'I decided to return to San Joee,
and have some alterations ' made in the'
mechanical part of our wagon. That night -
we had stopped at the house of a farmer

the advent of the telegraph. He was very

years. For the right to be exclusive it
was necessary that the line should be

many miles in advance and there was no

transportation consisted of the running
gear of a wagon on which were placeÂ«l
loose board* enough to hold our meagei
outfit â a coftee-pot, small sheet-Iron boil
er, tin plates, tin cups, knives, forks and
blankets. This wagon served the furthei
purpose of carrying the reel and running
out the wire.
It was then the 23d of September, 1S53.
In Jess than six weeks we must have com
pleted and In operation over two hundred,
miles of line. It was high pressure work
light from the start.
On the first day we strung up about
three miles of wire. The next day. ws
commenced ct daylight, worked untij
dark and managed to get six miles mor<3
In srood shape. \ So interested ha'd w<
been in our labors that as night closed In
we found we were lost We had no tent

in with the darkness and the cabin Had

ln* for it in vain we gave up the search
and set about to prepare supper. Then it
was that <ine cf the party In hunting foÂ»
firewood stumbled right on the cabin thai
had been almost under our noses all

brightest epots in all tnose six weeks of
hard work. Â¦
At that time there, was no eight-hour
law and, as our beds were generally made
on "the -soft . Bide of a plank" It was
almost Â¦ easier to work than to sleep. We
sent the line along at the good rate of
from five to seven miles a day. On the
fifth day out we had reached a point near
what is ; now Belmont, and the site of
what was afterward noted as the Ralston
mansion. Â¦Â¦..'â¢,.. . . .- Â¦ .

This was the first message ever trans

After this the line was used every night
to report the progress of work.
The native population were wonder

to consolidate with i le California State
Telegraph Company and to create a new
company called tne Overland Telegraph
Company,, with a capital stock of $1,250,000,
to complete a bne from San Francisco to
Salt Lake. This company, on the complo
tlon of the line, was merged intj the Cali
fornia Stnte Telegraph Company. (the cap
ital etock being doubled), which from that
time until its later consolidation with tho
Western Union owned and controlled the
telegraph lines from San Francisco to.
Bait Lake. Tho Western Union had In the
meantime. established a gimllar organlza-y
tion on the eastern side of the continent,
to.meet the line" from this side at Salt
Lake. \
The work of construction was com
menced without delay. 'All the material
Â¦was ordered and plans were made to com
plete the ttne before the clofe of 1861. The
work on, the eastern end was under the
superintendence of .Edward Cre'ghton.
while I was given' charge of the construe-'

The, lints of the California State Tele
graph Company . had been extended as
fur as Virginia City In Nevada after the
consolidation of the lines, so it was de
cided that we should' begin on the over
land telegraph nt Carson City.' The wire
arid Insulators had been ordered from the
East unrt shipped around Cape Horn. Tho
next most Important item of materials
were the poles. These had to be hauled
on wagons and distributed. along the routo
from Carson City to Salt Lake, a distance
of tOO miles.- As there was not a stick of
.timber In sight all along the whole dis
tance It seemed, a puzzle that would bo
hard to solve. Fortunately among my as
' uistanis. was a young man full of pluck
end energy. James Street, who was- a
personal frJerjd of BrJgham Younjj, and
early In, the spring he went to Salt Lnko
and mrule arrangements with Â¦ the Mor

section of the line. Furthermore he mado

advantage. A man who In a negative way
did a great deal for tho telegraph w.n
Sho-kup, head chief of the Shoshon^s
lie was not only a man of power In Ills
own tribe but exerted a strong Influence
over 4he Goshutea and Pah-Utes.
Sho-kup was persuaded to take a Bt>iÂ»?e
ride as far as Carson City and the tele
graph was explained to him.by-on Inter
preter. He afterward called it "We-ente
. mo-ktf-te-bopc," meaning "wire, rope ex

that it wuh an animal, and he wished to
know on what it fed. They told him It

was not disposed to believe that. He was
very well muted in Carson City and wan
told thru he might talk with the Big Cap

Thereupon he dictated tho following diii

it. No aano mon could be made to be

operator would know nothing about my'
coming until I rode up in front of the
office the next day.
Watermelons at that time were one dol- â¢

,The temptation was too great.
I said that not only would the operator
be 'expecting us, but I should wire hirn.to
meet us. at tne door with tho question, .

There were also received a large num-
Ler of news dispatches, among which
were the particulars of the death of Col

"Beauregard will retire beyond Eull
Run.'.V.': '->
The overland telegraph was then an ac
complished fact. A few years previous
news from the other side was only semi
monthly and usually from twenly-flve to
thirty, days old. Then came the semi
weeklyjmull by the overland route, with
news on an average from eighteen to
twenty days old.
After that came the pony express. Thfc
latter, though a vast improvement, on.
both the first and the second, only made
clearer that something remained to
be done to brine California within tho
sphere of the other civilized countries of
Â¦ Itils the' telegraph In Its first cllck<JI<l.
With it disappeared the feeling of isola
tion the inhabitants of the Pacific Coast
bad labored under. San Francisco was in
instant communication with New York
and the. Atlantic seaboard. -\
' The change was a great one. but It was
ono to which the people readily adapted
themselves, having wished and waited st>
Ions for- It. In that moment California
was brought within the circle of tho sls
terhod of States. No longer as' one be
yond the pals of civilization, but, .with
renewed assurance of peace and prosper
ity/ she was linked in electrical bonds \.oA
the great national family union, , A
by the tribe of white men telegraph ope
rators. At one time, about 200 miles east
of the Blerra Nevada, a thunder â¢torm
broke over the valley At some distance
from where we were working. The wirÂ«n
became so charged with electricity that
the men were obliged to use buckskin
gloves to avoid the shocks. Borne strange
Indians came up about this time and ons
of the bucks volunteered to help pull on
the wire that the men were stretching.
His bare hands and feet were Just tho
kind of a conductor that old electro had
been waiting for and It gave him such &
shock that he doubled over to the ground.
Quick as a flash he dropped the wire
nnd made the prettiest 400-yard dash that
I have ever seen. He didn't even stop to
take breath. Off at a safe distance, ho
recovered his dignity, came to a full stop
and gravely motioned for the uninitiated
bucks of his party to approach.
What he said to them la probably a
matter of Indian history, but always re
mained a dark secret with us. He felt
no antagonism toward tho party. In fact,
we went up a thousand per cent in hi3
estimation. Those Indiana decided that
we were an exctuslve tribe of white In
dians all by ourselves who could handle
the unseen spirits without trouble, and
they passed the word arcund among tha
tribes that the best thing to be done was
to treat us well and look out for the wire.
After that when an Indian wanted to
cross under a telegraph line the favorite
method wa3 for him to get on a horsa
and go under with full speed ahead.
Even later, when the Indians were on
the rampage for soldiers and settlers, they
always treated the telegraph with a cer
tain amount of respect. At one time they
wrecked an office and carried away Â«v
carboy of nitric acid under the delusion
that it was a superior brand of firewater.
The Indian does not drink hla whisky in,
pony glasses, but always takes a good
swig out of the demijohn to make sure.
The first buck who tackled the nitric acid
was laid out stiff and cold in less tlma
than it takes to tell about it, and there
upon It was decided in council hurriedly
culled that any tribe of white men who
could drink firewater as strong as that
were entitled to the undying respect and
admiration of the best Indian buck who
ever wore moccasins. And so the decree
went forth that the best thing for good,
.Indians was to give any of the parapher
nalia of the "wireless express men a
wide berth; that telegraph operators and
linemen were good fellows themselves, but
their affairs must not be meddled wlttt
under any circumstances.
The construction of the line was pushed
forward as rapidly aa possible. Many seri
ous dlitlcultlPd were encountered that re
quired our greatest energies to overcome.
In one instance sixteen miles of line wero
built In one day on the desert In order to
reach a point where water could be ob
tained. Again, our polo contractors failed
ua, and it was necessary to send our own
teams to the mountains to procure and
haul them.
The nrst contract with the Mormons
was also a failure, but Brigham Young
denounced the contractors from the pulpit
and said that the work of furnishing poiea
should and must be carried out. After
that things went better. Some of the polej
had to be hauled two hundred miles, most
of them being taken from tho mountain*
in the vicinity of Salt Lake, there- being
very few to be had west of that point.
Up to the 1st of October the work had]
progressed as well as could have been ex
pected, all things considered. The polea
wero nearly all delivered and the Una
completed, with the exception of soraej
fifty or sixty miles, between Ruby Valley*
and Schcll Creek, about midway between)
, Carson City and Salt Lake. For that Â»eo
tlon of the line we. were obliged to go into
the mountains ourselves to get poles. Wa
narrowly escaped being snowed in, but
after hard work managed to get all that
we wanted and be back on the plains be
fore the winter storms had started la
earnest. It wus a close shave, however,
and I had to go with the men myself to,
keep them from stampeding.
Having now secured all the poles necesw
Fary for the completion of the line and
having given orders for winding up all
matters and for the return of the expedi
tion, I returned to Ruby Valley on my
way home, so as to be in San Francisco
at the moment of the opening of the line.
I reached home in ample time for tha
first message across the great transcontl
Â¦ nental telegraph line, which Hew over the
wire on the evening of October 24, 1S61.
The great work which had been agitated
for so many years on this coast, in tho
East and in Congress was completed, and
in the short space of five months from tho
time the expedition moved from Sacra -
. xnento. â¢
It had been proposed to get up a cele
bration in honor of such an Important
event, but owing to the uncertainty as tÂ«>
the exact time when the line would bo
completed no preparation had been. made.
The employes of the. company who stool
.around manifested the greatest anxiety,
watching for the first click of the instru
ment across the continent. At last It
came and read as follows: - Â¦
r "SALT LAKE, Oct. 21,- 1861, 5:13 p. raw

"STREET."
The next dispatch was from Brlgham
Â¦ Young and read as follows:
ordered presents of food and clothing to
bo made . to him. Wo realized fully tlio
necessity of having the Indians for our
friends. and no pains. were spared to thU
end. j
Mr. Street contracted with the Mormons
for two to. three hundred miles of polej
for the eastern section of the line from
Salt Lake west, and I contracted for onÂ«
hundred miles running eust from Carson
City to Ruby Valley. I had many mln
glvings in respect to these contracts for
poles, especially regarding those for tho
middle section. Along that portion of tho
route the mountains and plains were tree
less as far as the eye could reach. \Vhero,
then,. the poles were to come from I could
.not conceive. But the frontier men with
whom the - bargain had been made ap
peared to know their business, and as I
afterward learned had In their hunting
expeditions discovered i canyons and
gorges in the mountains where stunted
pine arid quaking asp could be found rut-
Hclently large f<ir telegraph poles. So far,
then, all was satisfactory.
We purchased twenty-six wagons to
carry the materials over the Sierra Ne
vudas, and on the 27th of May, 1861, thÂ«
outtH was ready to move. It comprised
22i oxen, fifty men and several rldins
horses. The expedition was placed in
the charge of I. M. Hubbard, an experi
enced and energetic telegraph builder. In
spite of our best efforts it took us a month
to get over the mountains instead of fif
teen days, as had been first calculated,
so it was late In June that the expedition
reached Caison Valley and the work of
construction commenced. â¢
Tit the, meantime, the poles were being
distributed from both ends of the ; line.
ai.'.1 ns tho wiro and insulators for the
â¢niMern end had . been ordered shipped
ficm the Missouri River to Salt Lake,
the work began energetically from both
eiids. Â¦ .
The route selected was by way of
Omaha, up the South Platte, via old Port
Kearney, Fort Laramle, up the. Sweetwa
ter and through tho South Pass to Salt
Lake. Thence to Deep Creek, KÂ»can Can

turf. "A J-achtPtnah," as a devotee lias
pointed out, "will trace the pedigree! of his
favorite racer back through the Gloriana,
Puritan, Magic, and name the exact points
of excellence which she has obtained from
each. One has given windward qualities,
one exceeding stiffness, one beauty, and]
so on throughout a long list since the
America brought home the famous cup."
But It is to those who follow yachting
on the rolling blue and not from behind
rolltop desks that these qualities most
appeal. The slight points of' difference in
these racing machinesâ points apparently
so slight that even those fairly familiar
with the contestants have difficulty in dis
covering them, and which to the casual
observer are wholly hiddenâ are to the
yachtsman as plain as are the forest signs
to a trained woodsman. For instance, the
Constitution and the Columbia so closely
resemble each other that few outside the
Initiated can tell one from the other. Both
have the same marble white hull, the
same great towering mainmast stepped
Just forward of amidships, the same great
bowsprit spearing out from forward, the
same Matterhorn of canvas. One unfa
miliar with the two might have before
him a perfect technical description of each
and the photographs of both and the
chances are he would search the pictorial
representation in vain for Identification of
either.
Points of Difference.
And yet there are points of dissimilarity,
which the trained eye will distinguish as
far as It can see. The one distinguishing
point In these two, which all who sail
may note. Is the double spreader of the
Constitution, whereas the Columbia car
ries only a single spreader. To make plain
what a spreader Is, it may be well to ex
plain that It is a small spar "extending
laterally on either side of the mast for the
purpose of "spreading" the shrouds and in
bo doing giving them greater strength and
resisting power. As between the chal
lenger and the defender there will be no
need of searching out the points of dif
ferences, as the color of the hull will in
dicate which is whichâ the one being em
erald Â£Teen, the other milk whltel But
he or ehe who' goes " down :Â£o the course
In an excursion craft may still be all at
sea as to which Is winning the race ' or
which comes In victorious across the finish
line, as there are rules which complicate
results. One yacht, for Instance, will have
to give the other a time allowance and the
one which to all appearances may seem
the winner may. when the count is done,
show up loser by so many seconds or mln-,
utes, as the case may be.
There doubtless are few finer or more
Inspiriting marine spectacles than that
afforded by two high-class racing yachts
struggling neck and neck for the finish
line. But that is a sight one seldom has
the good fortune to see, although many
such heart disease finishes are promised
In the coming contest; this by reason of
the general belief that challenger and de
fender are more evenly matched than any
other two that ever fought out the battle
for the trophy. Even drifting matches
have an exciting Interest for some, but
the writer, who has drifted on the flank
of many of these, has never been able to
extract any excitement from contests- of
that kind. "A""' . * <

What Cup-Defenders Cost.
The cost of an attempt to "lift" the cup
and the price of fending off such effort
axe particularly interesting. The state
ment'that this cup attaining ambition of
, Sir Thomas will cost him in theneighbor
. hood of a round million for this present
effort alone may seem incredible at first
reading, but it Is not likely that his ex
penses will fall much below that figure,
Â¦ if any. , The building of the Shamrock,
the pay and maintenance of her crew, the
â¢ cost and maintenance of the magnificent
'steam yacht, the Erin; the charter of tho
Porto Rico, a 'big ocean going steamship,
' which Is to be used as a tender for tho
f Shamrock; the charter of the yacht TH
â¢ lie, a pretentious steam yacht which will
' be employed by Sir Thomas for thÂ© usa
and convenience of his many guests; tho
charter of the big James A. Lawrenco
and of the launch Dufferin, must; all be
counted in the cost.
Writing. In McClure's after the last In
ternational yacht race, Ray Stannard
â¢ Baker gave some- interesting figures con
j cerning the c#st of cup defenders. Speak-^
ling of the Columbia, he said: "It is
probable that no one outside of the build
ers and owners of the Columbia knowa
' exactly what she cost She could be
. constructed, so a well-known builder told
, me, for $80,000. But the Herreshoffs were
given carte blanche, and the very best
of everything was used In her construc
tion, so that she probably cost, includ
ing the services of the designer. Captain
â¢Nat' Herreshoff, fully double that sum.
The cost of the Defender was about
$100,000, a striking contrast with the old
America, which' was built for about $20.
000. The; famous ;cup defender Puritan,
built in 18S5, cost about $30,000, so George
Lawley^her builder, told me. It will be
seen that, the price 'of cup-, defenders has
gone up marvelously in fourteen years.
A substantial merchant vessel of the
same length of water line as the Colum
bia, first class in every particular, can
be built and fully rigged for $12,000 ot
$14,000.
Adopted American Sails.
"The Columbia's mainsail cost some
thing more than $2000, and it required ten
men, working twelve and one-half days
to sew its long seams. The full suit ots
sails. for the great racer cost fully $12,000, V
a sum quite sufficient to purchase out
right a good, full-rigged cruising. yacht.
The making of these sails so that they
will curve and catch the wind like a
bird's wing, drawing perfectly and yet
without wrinkling or straining the can
vas, -requires a degree of art and ac
curacy not easily appreciated without a.
vis t, such as I made, to the lofts of tho
.Wilsons, who have rigged many a famous
racer. Indeed, the snowy cetton sails of
American ships are famous the world
over. Up to the time when the Genesta
came cup-seeking In the * eighties tno
English had used hempen sails exclusive
ly. The English yachtsmen of the Ge
nesta, wondering at the marvelous work
of the American canvas, took back with
them the material for a new. suit of sails.
Since then American cotton has been
widely adopted by all grades of British
ships, as well as the American system
of attaching the sails to the spars-both
being a curious outgrowth of the cup
races."
The superb suit of racing canvas which
the Shamrock. II. win wear In the com
ing contest was cut ' and fitted by Mr.
Ratsey," reputed "to be the best sallmaker
in Great 'Britain. , He accompanied Sir
Thomas here, as did George I* Watson,
the eminent designer, " who constructed^
the challenger.

THE SXJNDAY XJALL.
Â¦ Coming now to the projected races these
will be run over what is known as the
.Sandy Hook course, the victor being the
yacht which wins three out of five events.
The races are to be a fifteen-mile straight
away beat or run to an outer mark and
back to the finish line, and a contest over
a triangular course with ten miles to each
leg. Like racing thoroughbreds ' of the
turf, racing yachts have their specialties,

broadly summarized under- the " head of
pointing, reaching and running. ' .

he had first fallen in '.with the. flying squadron
on ! May 19, when the squadron was steaming
toward Cienfuegos and Captain McCalla's sub
squadron was on Jts. way. from Cienfuesos -to
Key West. He had Â¦then.vunder Captain Mc-
Calla's orders,- undertaken to' communicate to
Commodore .Schley,. .his .infprmation concerning
the situation at Cienfuegos and had Â£lven this
information to the Scorpion for the commodore,

â¢ "We left Cienfuegos on ,the night, of the 26th.
at which time, as we learned from Insurgents,
the only vessels Inside .the harbor were the
two boats and several cannonleros." . Â¦
Commander Southerland told of his return
to Cienfuesos on May 24 and of accompany in*
the Marblehead ' to the: shore for the purpose
of communicating with the Insurgents. ; lie
also related that'm returning Captain McCalla
sent him full speed in advance of the Marble
head to notify the commander of the squadron
It was the last of the many exciting
moments of the contest, for very soon
the Columbia, getting her wind free again,
pulled out. and with surprising rapidity
opened up on the challenger and drew out
a lead that left the result no longer in
doubt. She crossed the line a winner,
not only on time allowance, but boat for

The stern chase is a long chase, but
slowly the old Columbia crawled up en
tne new Shamrock. At 2:10 she was
aoeam.and a half minute later was the

and at 2:14 was all of a half-length aheaa.
.from that time on to tho finish line she
Kept In the lead. The wind was now drop,
ping, but in spite of her much larger &ali
plan the Shamrock could not prevent tht,
steady;' though, slow, gain of the Columbia.
For nearly an hour the race continued
without- further event. Then, at 3:15, the
wind freshened slightly, filling out the
Immense sails of the Shamrock. Slowly
she crept up and lessed the gap betwuon
her and the defender. Now she was only
a half-length behind. Now she was on
nearly even terms, and it became a mat
ter of doubt as to which boat would firat
cross the finish line, less than a mile
away. 'â¢-., â¢" :
There was considerable delay in settling
spinnakers, the Shamrock waiting appar
ently for the Columbia and luffing out Jn
order to- prevent a blanket. : Finally at
1:37 the Columbia broke out her spinnaker
and at the same time a tremendous bal
loon jib. ...The Shamrock smartly followed
suit. . In the heavy roll of the sea, which
was- now on the port quarter of the two
boats, the. main booms trailed in the
water as they lurched to leeward. These

The Shamrock in the beat to windward
had thus gained thirty-nine seconds. &hÂ«
had beaten the Columbia boat for boat,
but had not overcome tne handicap of
forty-three seconds time allowance, which
under the rules of the New York ; Yacht
Club she was compelled to concede.
At 12:45 both boats, on the port tack,
were heading for the outer mark, which
on this occasion was the tug Edgard F.
Luckenbach, the raft which she carried
having failed to right itself when put
overboard. The wind now was the fresh
est of the day. The Shamrock had a lead
of at least 400 yards, and as she ap
proached the mark it was- seen that she
had handily beaten the old defender In
the windward work. She turned in ex.
cellent style, and with main boom square
off to port, the spinnaker boom was low

an equally good turn. The official time

speed in the least. Not a tremor could
be detected in the luffs of the sails of

tried to work herself out of the leeward

the question was repeated. Captain McCalla
replied: "None that I know of. The only

Captain McCalla testified at some length con
cerning the weather' and the sea on May 26
and 27. He said there was no difficulty la
coaling on the 27th, as the sea was smooth.
The witness said he had been present during
a conference of commanding officers on the
Brooklyn while the fleet was off Santiago on
May 24. Describing what took' place,- ho
said: .. -. -.
4 "The commanding officers were ordered on
board the Brooklyn on May 29. It was with
regard . to the work of blockade. I can only
remember one specific thing, which took place
at the close, and that was that Captain Evans
asked Commodore Schley If the Spanish ships
came out if be was going for them. He
said, 'Certainly,' and then arranged for a sub
division of fire from the ships under his com
mand on the Spanish, ships should they come
out."
On cross-examination by Mr, Raynor > the
witness said he had failed to execute an order
from Admiral Remey delivered while he was
ln command off Cienfuegos and directing that
all -except the smallest vessels be withdrawn.
He had, he said, failed. to leave the small ves
sels there.
"Did you do that on your own responsibil
ity?" â¢
"On my own responsibility." . ; Â¦
Referring to the fact that he had Informed
Captain Chadwick, Admiral Sampson's chief
of staff, of the code of signals arranged for
communicating with the Insurgents, he said
he did not in any way communicate with the
commander in chief. . Â¦= .
Mr. Raynorâ According to the customs and
regulations observed In cases of that sort was
it not your purpose that this communication
should- go to the commander in chief through
his chief "of staff? Â¦ ?/Â¦ ..."
. "Certainly," was the reply, .
The witness said further that he. thought It
had been common knowledge at -Key West
after his "arrival there on May" 19 "that the
Cuban Insurgents were on the coast near Cien
fuegos. but that no Information was given con
cerning the secret code. ; He ' had, he said,
failed to give the code to Commodore Schley
when he passed him, when the commodore was
on his way to Cienfuegos.. He said:
"I would have gone alongside and given him
my information."
He had ordered the Eagle to give Commo
dore Schley Information concerning the pres
ence of Insurgents, Â¦ but had not Â¦ given the
secret code to the- commander of that vessel.
He would have done so If he had known the
destination of the squadron. Replying to a
question Captain McCalla' said that Commo
dore Bchley's-fleet while off Santiago had never,
to his knowledge, been withdrawn to any dis
tance from th,e harbor of Santiago.
"Then,". ' said Captain Parker, "that story,
by whomsoever told, is absolutely false?"
"I object," shouted Captain Lemly, in a
voice as sharp as a- pistol -shot. â¢ Â¦ *'
"The objection Is sustained." said Admiral
Dewey,- "The question Is highly improper."
On redirect examination Mr. Hanna asked:
"If Commodore Schley had signaled you to
come on the Brooklyn and had stated to you
that his destination was Cienfuegos would you
or not have.. communicated to. him tho secret
signal to which you have- referred?"
"I would have given him the code, of course,"
answered the witness. <

WASHINGTON. - Sept. '28.â To-day's session
of the court of Inquiry began as usual at
11 o'clock with the recall of yesterday's wft
nestes for the purpose. of correcting mistakes
in their testimony and allowing other questions
to be asked them when' necessary to make
clear any point which had not -hitherto been
sufficiently elucidated by - them." Captain Mc-
Calla, who had commanded the Marblehead
during the Spanish ! war,, then' continued his
testimony, which had begun yesterday. Mr.
Hanna asked him: â¢. Â¦ ' Â¦ -
Communicate With Cubans.
McCalla Says Admiral Could Wot
SCHLEY HAD NO SECRET CODE
that Cervera's fleet was not Inside the harbor
at that point and had not been there.' He
had, he said, delivered this Information about
3 o'clock.
Describing the cruise from Cienfuegos to San
tiago, Commander Southerland said that from
midnight of May 20 to the afternoon of the
25th the Eagle had met very bad weather. This
was due to the fact that the sea had a "long
roll'! which was very trying to the yacht,
,as the vessel was then one-third full.
Â¦ "After. 1 o'clock of the 26th, when about
twenty-five. miles from Santiago," he said. "I
.was called alongside the flagship and the com
modore directed me to go to Port Antonio for
coal; and to report rough weather south of
Cuba. My answer substantially was that I
already had three days' coal, as much as the
Marblehead, meaning as much In proportion.
The commodore told me that I had not coal
enough for his purpose and directed me to car
ry out his orders. I then asked him again
very earnestly to let the Eagle remain with
the fleet and coal from the- collier. He very
courteously replied to me that he either very
much regretted or else was very sorry he
could not let me do so, as the Eagle had not
coal enough for his purpose, and again directed
me to proceed, which I did, after communicat
ing with the division commander."
"How much 'coal did the Eagle have?"
'â¢'Not less than twenty-seven tons."
Mr. Raynor questioned Commander Souther
land concerning his megaphone message to the
Scorpion on May 19, and displayed the log
book of that vessel to show that while other
facts were mentioned as having been mega
phoned by the Kagle, there was no mention of
the fact ihat Commander Southerland had said
anything about the conditions at Cienfuegos.
The witness said in reply to a question that his
own log made no mention of his message.
It was evidently," he said, "a question of
whether the young officer on deck at that time
put down ray exact words "
DISPATCH WAS NOT GARBI/ED.
Expert Testifies Begarding. Schley 'a
Message of May 28.
Lieutenant Barnes waÂ« recalled. Pending
his appearance Mr. Hanna made a statement
concerning the two versions of the Schley dis
patch of May 28. He referred to the fact that
not; only the translation of this dispatch, but
also the translation of a Navy Department dis
patch of May 27 had been called into question.
He, however, gave his especial attention to the
Schley message, saying:
"There Is no more important paper before thr
court than this telegram, and in order to dis
count its importance, in order to weaken its
terrible effect, there have been Introduced on
the record here suggestions that the dispatch
as printed by the Government Is not correct
Now we propose to* show that that dispatch aa
printed ln the appendix to the report of the
chief of the board of navigation for 1898 Is
precisely,- word for word, as that dispatch was
received by the Navy Department from the
wires ' and confirmed by the- telegraph com
pany. We propose to show further that that
dispatch as received by the Navy Department
was cipher word for cipher word as It left the
West Indies. Air it was placed on the wires
in Kingston so It was printed In the appendix.
I don't wish to lay any further stress upon
this matter except to say that in all my ex
perience in "Washington ln connection with the
management of the executive departments by
high officers of the Government and by sub
ordinates I have not found that great depart
ments of; the Government garble their official
documents."
Lieutenant Barnes "was then shown and Iden
tified the cipher copy book of tho auxiliary
cruiser Harvard, which vessel during the war
was under command of Captain (now Admiral)
Cotton. This was the vessel which carried Ad
miral Schley*s dispatch to Kingston, to be
there transmitted by cable to Washington.
Lieutenant Barnes said he was familiar with
the department's cipher code and that last
night and before he had made a translation of
tha dispatches as presented. He then read
his translation and was questioned concerning
it by Mr. Hanna, who asked:
"Have you examined the duplicate ot the
cipher j received at the department and com
pared It with the cipher as It appeared ln
the press copy?" Â¦ . '
Â¦ "I have." "- * â¢ ' - : . - .Â¦
"Was the cipher message as received by the
department confirmed by ths telorrarh â¢ com^
pany?" .. â¢; Â¦
"It was." " - . ' -
"I will ask you whether In cipher those words
as they appear In that press copybook are
identically the same as those received by the
department, or is there any variation what
ever in word or letter?" . . . Â¦ â¢ ,
"They are Identically the same in, word.
Three words as I recollect It have letters
which are Indistinct in one place or the other
and rnlcrht be .mistaken, although there Is no
chance of mistaking the word." â¢ .
"Then I will ask you whether according to
the press copybook that dispatch left Kingston
as it was received at the department In
cipher?" Â¦ â¢ ' Â¦'.*Â¦
- "It did. If this was the dispatch, that was
sent of which this is a copy."; ;v- ; Â¦.-
Mr. Hanna, holding ln his hand a copy of the
appendix containing the official print of the
'Schley dispatch,, pointed out the discrepancies
between that print and, the translation made
by Lieutenant Barnes from the Harvard cipher
book, which showed that the principal differ
ences were as follow?: The substitution of
the word "heavy" for the word "helpless" in
the arnendix translation and the omission of
the word "leaving" ln tha new translation, re
ferring to the departure from Key West.
The comparison also showed changes such es
the omission of the wor.d "the," and the wit
ness explained that often ln translating cipher
messages the name ot a country la generally
added alter that of a town or particular lo
cality in order to make the Information full
and SDeclflc* He al.sa gave this as the ex
planation of the addition of the word "leav
ing," saying that It was done to bring out the
sense of the- message. With reference to the
word "heavy" for "helpless" the witness said;
"Heavy and helpless are very, close to each,
other ln the cipher code. - A < change of a
single number at the end i which would In
dicate a change of a letter In a word or m
mistaken letter in a word would produce that
sort of a chance."
Mr. Hanna reminded the witness that at the
end of the message an printed ln the appendix
was the following- sentence; "Very difficult
to get cable to hold," which sentence did not
appear ln the copy of the dispatch as preserved
by Admiral Schley In his press copy book. He
then asked whether these words could by any
translation or any legitimate use of the cipher
have been added, or whether they could be due
to a cipher error, pr had . they been simply
added. â¢ ...-.
"They could not have been simply added ln
cipher," replied the witness.
By Mr. Eaynorâ I do not think there is any
disagreement between us. There was a dis
patch sent by Commodore Schley, delivered to
Captain Cotton on the Harvard. That dispatch
was translated into cipher on board the Har
vard between Santiago and Kingstoa That
cipher translation came here to Washington
and you made a translation which I have no
doubt is perfectly correct. That translation
seems to, accord in most particulars with the
exception of some trivial things with the

Mr. Raynor then cross-examined the witness,
first asking him whether he had any knowl
edge that, the cipher dispatch ln question Is
a correct translation of the dispatch that Com
modore Schley gave to Captain Cotton.
Â¦ "I have.no special knowledge that it is." the
witness replied. .'."
'.'"Who has the original dispatch,* the original
English dispatch, of which this Is a press
copy?" . : - : . '-
. "I do not know. I rsuppose that the captain
of the. Harvard has H among his papers. It
cannot ! be found among the papers he has
turned In at the Navy Department."
Mr. Raynor: "Then we have here this case:
it was shown; conclusively by Captain
McCalla's testimony that the secret code
to be used in carrying on communication
with the Cubans with a view of learning
the position of the Spanish fleet was never
given to Schley ana that the commander
of the flying squadron was practically
working. in the uark when he could have
been supplied with valuable information.
; Mr. Siayton did not press his request to
be allowed to appear as counsel for Ad
miral Sampson, aa he had announced that
he would do. . He wrote a second letter. to
the court, renewing his application ana
recounting the times that Admiral Samp
son's- name had: been brought into the
case, but he left the city later in the day,
requesting the court to hold up the matter
for the present.
Commander Southerland explained tho
condition of the Eagle during the cam
paign- and told of the part that vessel
â¢played. He said the slow progress made
ih ihe cruise. to Santiago was due to the
fact that the: vessel was one-third full of
water, lie also told of signaling the
Scorpion to inform Commouore fachiey
that tne Spanish, squadron was not in.thu
harbor at Cienf uegos. . Capiain McCalla
said that he had suggested to Schley
after the battle off banUago that there
was glory enough in the victory tor all.
.WASHINGTON. Sept. 28.â In the Schley
court of inquiry to-day Captain McCalla
of, the Marblehead continued his testi
mony, which was began yesterday, and
the court heard the testimony of lieuten
ant Commander W. H. H. Southerland,
who 1 commanded the Eagle during the
Spanish war, and also that of Lieutenant
Casslus. B. Barnes. The latter is a cipher
expert In the Navy Department,'. and his
evidence .was devoted, to showing that the
dispatch from Commodore Schley to the
Navy-.Pepartment of j May- 28", 1898,- saying
that he could not, much to his regret,
obey the orders of the department, as
printed in -'the' official reports, was a cor-;

An old sore or ulcer is not only a source of great bodily discomfort and pairi, Kut the i
constant care, worry and anxiety over one of these malignant festering Iplaces produces an
unhealthy state of the nervous system and the patient becomes morbidly ' sensitive, miserable

.of strength and vitality. An eating, lingering ulcer naturally fills the sufferer with fear
while noting the daily growth of the sore, from which there is a slow but perpetual discharge
of yellow or greenish watery matter, and feeling the dull, throbbing or sharp shooting, pains

to these old sores and ulcers.
Washes, salves, nor anything else applied directly to the sore can do any permanent 1 good ;
neither does the use of the knife or flesh destroying plaster cure, for local causes have nothing
to do^with these germ-breeding plague spots. You might cut out every particle of the diseased
flesh and scrape the bone, but another sore would come. The germs or poison in the blood must
be destroyed, the stream of sluggish, polluted blood purified and made strong before the heal-
ing process begins and the sore or ulcer can get well. S. S. S. is the only remedy known that
can and does accomplish this. It cleanses and purifies the circulation, and when new, rich blood
is carried through the little veins arid arteries to the sore, it brings about a healthy healing
around the edges, and a permanent and thorough cure is soon effected. S. S. S. not only

He still believes himself the leader of his
people and that they would all support
him and whatever cause he espoused.
Chaffee has no fear that Aguinaldo could
start another insurrection and he has rec
ommended to the War Department the
withdrawing of the guards about Agui
naldo' s house. He would not formally
release Aguinaldo. but as he Is living like
other people in Manila, with the excep
tion of a military guard, the guard could
be discontinued, removing all semblance
of restraint upon him. He could then go
where he pleased, having taken the oath
of allegiance, and there would be no dis

WASHINGTON, Sept. 28.-The War De
partment is considering the advisability
of quietly withdrawing the guards from
the house occupied by Aguinaldo in Ma

fee believes this would be the easiest way
of disposing of Aguinaldo. The former
leader of the Insurrection is not consid
ered as a danger to the peace of the isl
and, as his followers have given up their
arms and surrendered. They pay no at
tention to him in captivity and Chaffee
believes they would pay no more atten
tion to him free and at large. The Gov
ernment does not care to punish him. and
it ha6 kept him prisoner only for his own
protection from the friends of General
Luna, whom Aguinaldo had murdered.
The Secretary- of War has him kept a
prisoner because it would be a reflection
upon this Government to allow him to be
murdered in the streets of Manila.

CTJTTER GRESHAM AND
YACHT ERIN COLLIDE
NEWVY0RK. Sept. 2S.-Sir Thomas Lip-
ton's steam yacht Erin narrowly escaped
a serious accident to-day, when, just after
the Shamrock and the Columbia had
rounded the turn, the United States rev
enue cutter Gresham collided with her.
Both boats were doing patrol duty, the
Gresham in the hands of Thomas B.
Walker and the Erin for the day in
charge of Lieutenant Bcedeker, of the
United States revenue cutter service. In
starting to clear the course for the home
stretch the Gresham apparently tried to
cross the bow of the Erin. There was
evidently a misunderstanding of signals
by the Gresham. and it was too late
when at last she tried to back out and the
Erin put on full steam ahead. The rev
enue cutter struck the yacht a glancing
blow on the port quarter, some thirty or
forty feet from the stern. A plate was
bent, some paint rubbed off end the rail
bruised. An inside athwartship deck beam
was buckled. When the Gresham came up
later to ask what damage was done Sir
Thomas himself from the bridge said
through a megaphone:
"I know you could not help it. You are
the last man in the world to do such a
thing. Only let me get to Sandy Hook
and I don't care. There is not a cent's
worth of damage. It is all right."
;. Aboard in the cabin hesaid: "It was a
narrow escape. If the Gresham had
struck us amidships we would probably
have been sunH., Commander Walker is
a special friend of mine and I know he
is much sorrier for what -has happened
than I:"
Meantime the Shamrock had taken a
tow from her tender and had drawn out
of the ruck of the steamers. Escorted by
the Erin, which showed a bJg hole that
The Corsair set American flags at both
peaks, gaffs and taffrail. Soon the whole
fleet blossomed out in the national colors.
The Corsair went alongside the defender
and her crew gave three cheers, which
the Yankee tars aboard the Columbia an
swered with bared heads. The whole fleet
seemed anxious to escort the Columbia to
her anchorage. .
As she crossed three lengths ahead the
enthusiasm broke out again with re
doubled energy. Every Yankee skipper
grabbed his whistle cord and made a ter
rific noise and din. Sirens wailed and the
white steam jets- made it look as if every
ship in the fleet had broken her steam
chest. The Corsair. J. P. Morgan's steam
yacht, threw her power Into smoke.
Everybody cheered. Men and .women
jumped up and down for very joy. Not a
few hats tossed Into the air fell over
board, but their owners cared not. .
But when the racers had spread their
wings, spinnaker matching mainsail and
balloon jibs drawing forward, and the
white flyer Columbia bfRan to eat up the
green water between her and the chal
lenger, drooping spirits began to rise, and
when the yachts got on even terms, about
half way home, the bands began to play
and the people raised a cheer.
As they approached the Ilnlshllne, the
Columbia leading by a half-dozen lengths,
all the pent-up enthusiasm, burst forth.
About a quarter of a mile before they
reached the line, the goiaen boat blank
eted the white one and for a moment she
ran up alongside and it looked as If she
would be first home. Cheers died in pa
triotic throats. Suddenly, as the Colum
bia luffed off and got her wind clear, she
forged ahead and came tearing down like
mad.
The Yankee skippers were too polite
not to pull their whistle cords, but tho
toots were not loud nor long, and the
bands did not play "Columbia, the Gem
of the Ocean."
The Shamrock wore around, with her
spinnaker pole to starboard, like a lance
in rest, and the big steam yacht Erin, with
the "bloody hand of Ulster 1 ' in the Royal
Ulster Yacht Club ensign at her taffrail,
opened her whistle Jong and loud. It was
the first time Sir Thomas had felt the joy
of victory, and he and his party probably
enjoyed it to the full.
carried the "yachts^along the "Long Island'
shore straight out to sea. The start was
thrilling. The yachts bounded away
across the line like a couple of runaway
horses, the challenger a half-length ahead
and to windward, in the maneuvering be
fore the start Captain Sycamore had
given the wily Yankee skipper a genuine
surprise, returning a Roland for the Oli
ver he received on Thursday. Just when
Barr thought he had .him under his lee
the Englishman deadened his headway
and then luffed under the Columbia's
stern into the weather berth. This victory
for the Shamrock at the very first of the
race the Columbia could not overcome in
the iong beat to windward.
. The two big yachts were an inspiring
sight to the spectators as they plunged
seaward, pounding great fountains of
spray from their bows and drenching the
crews lined up along the weatner rail.
They heeled to the wind until their lee
rails were awash in the swirling, bubbling
seas, and from the windward side they
showed yards of their bronzo under
bodies. Neck and neck, tack and tack,
they raced like a team of horses. Dismay
began to be written on the faces of the
patriots as Barr tried once, twice and
rinally a third time to crosa the bow of the
foreigner, only to be forced around each
time by tho lean golden muzzle of the
Britisher. Â¦ Visions of the dear old cup,
that means the yachting supremacy of the
world, vanishing across the waters danced
before their eyes.
On and on they flew, turning twin wings
of foam from their bows, and the Colum
bia seemingly falling back rather than
gaining. The hearts of the patriots sank
lower and lower. As the yachts got far
ther out the swells lengthened and the
white flyers seemed to labor more heav
ily in the long waves.
Just after passing Long Beach Hotel,
with its verandas and windows . filled
with people, the old City of Paris, now
the Philadelphia, of the American line,
came foaming in from the east with a
bone in her teeth. She headed slightly
northward between the. Â«racers and the
shore, in order not to impede them with
her wash and went like an express train,
dipping her flag in salute. Her passen
gers and crew lined her rail for a sight of
the exciting spectacle until she was far
down to port. The vessels in the excur
sion fleet by this time were rolling badly.
Many of the spectators were forced to the
seclusion of their, cabins, and many were
Kept near the rails. The excursion vessels

the revenue cutter Gresham had stove in
her port quarter, she headed for the berth
behind the hook. Some of the excursion
boats dropped back to salute the popular
sportsman, who has bepji game enough
to make a second effort to lift the cup,
and then the whole fleet moved on in a
jnad race for home, many of the skippers
Ukeeplng their whistles going until they
.reached the Narrows at the entrance of
the upper bay.
.When it was all over Sir Thomas Lipton
showed himself the thorough sportsman,
he is.
"Well.*! he said, as he stood on the
deck of the Erin, "that's one dot against
us. But in my own heart I am just as
hopeful as 1 was this morning, for I feel
that if I only have a wind I am all right.
It was a fair and square race, not a fluke,
but it was not Shamrock's day. Â¦ We want
a breeze that will put that deck" six inches
under water, and then you will see a race. :
Be sure of one thingâ I was licked fairly j
to-day."
Captain Bob Wringe. who was on the
bridge of the Erin, at Sir Thomas Llpton's
eibow, said: - . ...
_*'If we get a fresh breeze we will lift
the cup yet. A nine to twelve knot breeze
is what we want.*'
AHEHICA1 TACHT BEATS CHALLEHGER
LONDON, Sept. 28..â The London crowds
began to watch the bulletin boards, col
ored bombs and variegated flashlights
without much hope of the challenger
winning, but when it was announced that
the' Shamrock was ahead at the turn of
tho outer mark, the immense assemblages
at the Crystal and Alexandra palaces and
on the Thames embankment became sur
prisingly cheerful, and as the successive
green illuminations showed the Shamrock
was still leading after the turn, expecta
tion of her winning rose to a certainty:
but when, shortly after the turn, red
tires and red rockets suddenly announced
that the Columbia was leading and later
that she had won, the amazed multitudes
stood silent. Here and there was a *"ild
American screech and a few groans and
hisses, and then the disgusted crowds
siowly broke up.
The scant accounts of the race circu
lated in the extra editions of the evening
papers and on the ticker tapes, describ
ing the keenness and closeness of the fin
ish have, however, restored popular faith
somewhat in the possibility of the Sham
rock's final success, though more experi
enced judgment, taking both days' per
formances together, does not get much
consolation. The betting has almost
ceased, though around the hotels some
Americans rather freely offered two and
three to one on the Columbia to-night.
SHORT-LIVED EXUBERANCE
OF CROWDS IN" LONDON
"It's all right/ but provided no one was
hurt I would lose a dozen Krins if neces
sary to lift the cup." -
The Erin's small boat was promptly
manned, and within a few seconds after
the crash the men stood ready to lower
away, if necessary, but fortunately it was
not necessary, as Sir Thomas himself an
nounced from the bridge to his startled
guests:
I SALINAS, Sept. 28.â At a recent meet
ing of the Women's Christian Temperance
Union of this city it was decided not to
allow the San Francisco Examiner to be
left at the free reading room. The reason
for taking such action was that the pa
per is not a fit publication for the public
to read, being too sensational and not re
liable.
Women Bar Hearst's Papsr.
It was a . dirty trick. The idea of using
family troubles as weapons and striking at a
prominent club over the head of a woman is
extremely low. Mrs. Halsht has asked for a
divorce, it is true, but neither in the com
plaint nor in her conversations with me has
she ever tried to blame the Bohemians for
her trouble. In her complaint she alleges that
her husband, in April, 1901, willfully and
wrongfully inflicted grievous bodily injury
upon her, and that is the only ground on which
she asks the court to grant a decree.
Attorney -Henry, who represents Mrs.
Haight, in speaking of the story pub
lished in the Examiner, said yesterday:
In this manner the Examiner is using
the family troubles of the Haights to try
and get even on the Bohemian Club. As
a matter of fact, the Bohemian Club Is
not the cause of the quarrel, and the
friends of the entire Haight family are up
In arms against the Examiner.
The Examiner stated that Haigrht.
through associating with the â¢"dissolute"
members of the Bonemian Club, neglected
his young wife and made her life so un
bearable that she was compelled to seek
relief through the divorce courts.
â¢ According to the story published in the
Examiner, the Haights lived happily to
gether until the husband became a mem
ber of the Boherplan Club. According to
Hearst's paper, the couple were married
in 1893, were happy in each other's com
pany for several years and then "Mr.
Haight seemed inclined to give up his
home for his club, and the result of his
association with the rapid element in
bohemianism was soon being talked
about"
- That" the Examiner does not care whom
it injures so long as it can attain its own
ends was demonstrated Wednesday morn
ing, when, for revenge, it made an attack
upon the Bohemian Club for ordering the
yellow sheet off the club files. The Exam
iner, accused the members of the club of
being the cause of -a divorce suit insti
tuted against Henry H. Haight, a promi
nent Bohemian, by Gertrude Haight.

SAVE THE BULL'S LIFE
On our second morning out from Liverpool,
Friday. August 16, 1801, about 6:40 a. m., John
McCullough of New STork and the writer were
seated at the head of the main stairs on board
the 'Bteamer Teutonic, bound for New York,
when Sir ;Thomas came up the stairs. At the
landing ..we arose and extended the morning
greeting, when he asked us to be seated. Dur
ing the conversation we wished he might win
the coming race, as we believed It would create
a livelier interest in; yachting for the future;
when, unsolicited on our part and without any
reserve on his part, he went on to tell us how
his captain had sold out two years ago (for
about two hundred or three hundred poundsâ
I am not certain whether he said two or three
hundred), but that his crew was true as steel.
We then said to him that when he found his
captain whs not doing what was right he
should have discharged htm. Mr. Lipton re
plied that he was not a sailor and that he

Following 1Â» the statement made by Mr.
Wade and appended thereto is the letter
he received from Mr. McCullough:
TOLEDO. Ohio. Sept. 28.â Several weeks
ago a statement wns published to the
effect that Blr Thomas Ltpton, on his re
cent trip ucross the waters to this coun
try, made tho statement that one of his
captains sold him out ln the last race for
Â£300. This statement was credited to B.
V. Wade, for years one of tho foremost
business men of this community, who
said Sir Thomas made that remark to
him when they were fellow-passengers.
Sir Thomas promptly denied it.
Mr, Wade remembered that a prominent
wholesale merchant of New York, John
McCullough, of the Belfast Linen Hand
kerchief Company; had been present and
overheard the statement. He was rather
nettled at Sir Thomas' curt denial of the
assertion and wrote to Mr. McCullough
for a confirmation.

FRESNO, Sept. 28.â The members of the
California Raisin Growers' Association,
at a meeting held to-day decided to carry
on the business of the association under
both the existing contracts and the new
leases. The amount of the crop placer!
in the hands of the association by the
compromise Is &S per cent. The attend
ance was made up of about one-thlrn or
the association's membership and a *maU
number of "outside" growers.
After a brief preliminary statement.
President Kearney referred to a circular
that had been l5sued and distributed by
G. V. Martin, an attorney of Fresno,
sharply criticizing the new bylaws und^r
the New Jersey Incorporation and at
tacking the board of directors. Kearney
made a detailed defense of the bylaws,
and added that the Incorporation was
made ln New Jersey because, under the
laws of California, the association W4.ulÂ«l
have to observe the co-operative law.
Replying to questions. Kearney said
that no discrimination would bÂ« marto
between growers sÂ»lgned under the old or
new contracts. The new association 13

The Buckeye mill was running night and
day on flour orders, and gave employment
to twenty men. Its capacity was 700 bar
rels a day. The insurance on the burned
property is $35,000. The fire destroyed the
electric wires on the street and the town
is in darkness. The cause of the fire is
not known, but it is believed to have re
sulted from spontaneous combustion or-a
spark from an electric wire.
On the railroad tracks near the burning
mill were a number Â»of loaded cars, but
these were removed to a place of safety
by the engine of the Knights Landing
train. â¢ ' Â¦ Â±
The blaze was first noticed on an upper
floor of the Buckeye mill, a brick and cor
rugated Iron structure, located at the cor
ner of Fifth and A streets. An alarm was
sounded immediately and the fire depart
ment was at the scene promptly. So rap-
Idiy, however, did the 1 names spread
among the inflammable materials ln the
building that the flre-flghting apparatus
was far from being adequate. For a time
It seemed a hopeless task to attempt to
stay the blaze, but the firemen worked
heroically . and eventually succeeded in
preventing the ignition of other buildings
which occupy an area of two square
blocks. â¢ -
.MARYSVILLE. Sept. 28.-A disastrous

SAX JOSE. Sept. 2S.â The heroic con
duct of little Howard Frost, the flve
year-old son of Oeorg? A. Frost, a moun
tain mail carrier, saved his two-year-old
sister from a horrible burning to death
yesterday.
The Frost family live back of Mount
Hamilton, at the Bayou, ten milf>a from
the big observatory. Frcst carries mail
from Mount Hamilton to San Antone Val
ley. Mrs. Frost had gone to a spring
about a mile from home to do 3)me wash-
Ing leaving the children with th^Jr
father. After completing the washing sue
started home, leaving slumbering coals
by which she had heated the water.
The children grew weary of playing and
started to find their mother. They had
gone to the spring and in playing about
the fire the little girl's clothes became
Ignited. Howard ran to his sister's aid
and tore off her clothing. In doing 30
hla hands were badly burned.
When Mrs. Frcst found her children the
girl was naked. Her clothes had been en
tirely consumed, but the child was not
burned. The little boy was getting some
cloths to cover up his sister.

The Berkeley Oratorio Society, Clinton
R. Morse, conductor, presents on. Thurs
day next at Shattuck Hall Mendelssohn's
"Elijah" with the following soloists:
It appears that we are .not to have the
Gerardy recitals after all, or," at least,
tht the celebrated 'cellist will not be
heard here until February next. A change
of plan has made San Francisco more
nearly the last instead of the first city of
his American appearance this seson, and
Boston, where he will have the unusual
honor of appearing five times with the
Boston Symphony Orchestra, will hear
first that wonderful Stradlvarius and its
talented owner. Gerardy has had a finely
successful season in Australia this sum
mer and also gave several prosperous con
certs in* Honolulu.
The management, however, claims nn
equality of merit with the Casino produc
tion â in some regards even a superiorityâ
and that has so far sufficed to fill the New
York theater for more than a year and
the end thereof no man knows.
George E. Lask, as before Intimated, is
responsible for the stage management of
the Columbia production to-morrow nlgnt.
and one can therefore feel reasonably jsure
of that part of the entertainment. Frank
Palma, another Caiifornian, Is music-ii
director, and Laura Millard, sometime so
prano of light opera seasons at the Tivoll
a few years ago, is another contribution
from the State. Then there is William T.
Carleton, long and favorably known
here as head of his own light opera com
pany that toured the State for years a
couple of decades ago with its headquar
ters at the old Bush-street Theater.
Neither, perhaps, should be omitted ihÂ«i
name of Fred Herr, who, with an excel
lent training in the Southern Pacific of
fices at Los- Angeles, fills to admiration
the role of the company's treasuror.
"Florodora" brings, therefore, many old
friends here, and, if not for herself alone,
will be welcome for theirs.
It therefore came in Mn Fisher's way,
who also incidentally secured the services
of Mr. Dunne's partner, Phil Ryley, and
one of the best comedians of the day,
while he was about it. Now there are
three "Florodoras" running in Americaâ
the original Casino production In New
York, the company that will appear here
to-morrow and another that began an
Eastern season in Philadelphia last week
â all under . the fortunate "Florodora"
Fisher's management. The "old original"
"Florodora" of the Lyric Theater in Lon
don, by the way. Is still running. It Is
now in its third, year.
known Dunne & Ryley Company; . that,
by the way, dissolved partnership over
the transaction. Dunne had the option of
the popular opera, but after his somewhat
disastrous season at the California Thea
ter last summer had not the wherewithal
to obtain It.
The Rochester Democrat thus presents
the case for the managers, and as it rep
resents lucidly the general point of view
But it does not seem to have occurred
to any one here to question the right
eousness of those Saturday night per
formances, nor of those In the interim
between the close of the deplorable trag
edy and the funeral of the President,
though a large portion of the usual au
diences signified their decent sorrow by
absenting themselves from the theaters.
But those who . stayed away have criti
cized neither the various managements
for keeping open house nor the play
goers who attended the performances:
neither the actors who took part therein,
nor the owners of the several attractions;
â¢wherein, as plain as a .pikestaff, appears
the vital difference between out selves and
our Eastern neighbors^ â with the honors
where honor is due. In the East the
manager has been very generally called
upon to defend his policy in keeping open
a place of amusement at a time of pro-,
found national sorrow, and the question
has created a considerable bitterness in
the discussion. The. action of James K.
Hackett in closing his theater from the
day of the President's death until after
the funeral, sustaining thereby a personal
loss of $2000 a night, seems to have formed
the center of discussion and Is variously
interpreted according < to the bias of the
interpreter as "gallery play," "pure ad
vertisement" or as a noble sacrifice to a
ketnly sensitive regard for the national
proprieties. The latter view seems to
prevail with the general public, who have
accorded Mr. Hackett the highest praise
for ' his action. 1 the former -with â¢ other
managers, who say that the actor's line
of conduct has given rise; to unjust com
parisons between his and their policies.
On the day of the funeral at Canton
almost every American theater was closed
both afternoon and evening, with some
exceptions among the vaudeville houses
in Chicago. In London also the day was
generally observed among the American
players and - managers, notably Gillette.
now playing- in "Sherldck Holmes" at the
Lyceum, Nat Goodwin and Maxine El
liott at the Comedy; at the Shaftesbury,
"Are You a Mason?"; at the Century, "The
"Whirl of the Town," and the Duke of
York's, the Apollo and the vaudeville. In
San. Francisco every theater was closed,
every business house except drug stores
and eating houses, even to the cigar and
bootblack stands, and the day with Its
strange accord of physical atmosphere,
heavy, pallid, mournful, and the -weird
quiet, will long Â¦ be remembered with a
sorrowful shudder.
: - â¢Â« o CURIOUS illustration of the rad
â¢/\ ical difference between, the East
'/âY ' ern and Western ethical outlook
/'Â¦ \ is the more or less acrid dlscus-
r sion now raging in the East on
the keeping open of the theaters there on
â¢ the day of the late President's death, co
incident, with the absolute silence on the
subject maintained here. The San Fran
cisco theaters, â¢without exception, were
closed In the afternoon, thus sacrificing
the matinee receipts, and were also at one
In keeping open for the Saturday night
performances, a course of conduct that
excited here neither comment nor con
troversy. In New York most of the
theaters pursued the same policy, -with
the important exceptions of Weber &
Field's Music Hall, the Broadway Theater
and Wallack'sâ where James Hackett was
appearing in "Don Caesar's Return" â
that were all closed for the day, while in
Chicago the theaters were open both in
the afternoon and evening.
If the particular edition of "Florodora"
â¢with -which we are to- be regaled to-mor
row evening at the Columbia Theater Is
not a success we shall ourselves be largely
to blame, for it turns out to be Quite a
family affair. There are any number of
Californians (more or less) concerned in
the production, from John. C. Fisher, who
owns it, to George E. Lask, the stage
manager, the late lamented stage director
of the Tlvoli. Mr. Fisher is. or was, the
owner of the San Diego Opera-house, and
when the American rights of "florodora"
were on the market in London gecured
them after a famous fight with the. well-

Mr. Oscar Maurer, I was forgetting to
note, accompanied Mr. Barnhart with
sympathy, taste and spirit.
I do not think the pianist's programme
Â¦was chosen altogether fortunately. The
Mozart variations in G have not been so
long neglected for nothing, neither Chopin
at his cheapest in the Op. 16 "Rondo"
and the angularities of the Griegr E minor
sonata (I know this is rank heresy) do
not suffice to put one into most harmoni
ous mood. The Bach "Glgue" was de
lightful, though I know the pianist has
sometimes done it ampler Justice, and a
new "Song of the Waves" by Arthur
Henton is a most picturesque and pleas
ing number and was given with full sense
of its values. In one of the Mendelssohn
"Lieder" Miss Hullah most nearly ap
rroached tenderness, but her distinguish
ing' characteristics are an admirable con
scientiousness, considerable technical at
tainment and unusual poise.
Miss Hullah is a Leschetlezky pupil
and. I understand, an aecredltÂ«Â»d repre
sentative of the famous master's meth
ods. She has certainly all the character
istics of the Â«chool. the inimitable stac
cato, the round, full tone and fine clarity
of execution. Hers Is the scholarly,
academic, logical schoolâ an Intellectual
rather than emotional conception â and
from this standpoint her work is emi
nently satisfactory. But it is as if ehe

r-jr^ HE Examiner, in an effort to fix upon The Call some of the yellow pitch of anarchy with
I which the yellow sheet has itself been defiled for years past, yesterday published in black
1 .faced type at the head of its editorfal columns an extract from a report upon Emma Gold
Â¦"Â¦ man made by a woman employed upon the staff of The Call at the time the noted anarchist
was in this city in April, 1898. The extract separated from its context gives but little ground for
the insinuation which the yellow distorter of the truth would have it convey, and when read in
its proper place in the article it affords no such ground at all. The publication of it ttiefefoif! in
the way in which it was presented to the public by the Examiner was a deliberate attempt at defa
mation by means of falsehood and misrepresentation.
We cannof permit the yellow faker to place The Call in even a seeming alliance with Exam
iner motives to promote anarchy, and accordingly take space enough this morning to refute the
falsehood and expose the trickery to which Hearst in his desperation resorts,
When Emma Golilmnn came to San Francisco a member' of the staff of The Call was &ent
to attend her lecture, interview her and give a personal impression of her character and manners.
That work is done in the ordinary routine of legitimate journalism in order that the public may
be informed concerning nny person in whom there is general interest at the time, even if that
person be a murderer whose crime has shocked the community. The report concerning Mifw Gold
man was published on April vj}\ 1898, m a part of the local news of the day. On the very next
day there \su published nn editorial setting forth the condemnation which The Call lias, never
failed to pronounce upon nunrehy and its votaries whenever the occasion hag called for it. That
the public inny have now an opportunity to perceive how grossly the Examiner 1ms lied in this
ense we rcpublish both the interview and the. editorial in full, The report ran thus: ' Â¦ t 'Â¦ '
I2M/V1A GOLD/Y\AINi ANARCHIST.
A little womanâ she enii't lÂ»e five feet tnll-^lier round slender figure neatly drc'sscd In black, a bunch nf
carnations at her belt nml one Blowing vividly in her brown hair, n white collar at her fair throat and white
lace falliiiR over her tiny hands, Her eyes are beautifully clear and stray, her forehead is fine and low " '
though the head itself seems narrow, the small nose is a bit blunt*and the thin lips have an habitual disdain
ful curl that is far from pleasing.
This is Emma Goldman, the anarchist, who suffered a. year's imprisonment in New York for "inciting to ,
riot." . ' '. â¢
"I didn't incite to riot." she paid to me after last night's meeting was over. "I merely quoted Cardi- ,
. nal Manning's words, 'Necessity knows no law.' "
"But there was an implication, wasn't there? You meant them to riot?" Tasked her.
Incite to riot?
Why, this five feet of feminine anarchy is the most dangerous enemy society has. Had she lived a
century ago she would have been beheaded. Two centuries aeo. Emma Goldman, anarchist, would have been
delivered over to the loving embrace of tlie'jungfrau, while in the sixteenth century she would have been
nicely boiled in oil or beheaded and then neatly broken on the wheel.
But this little Russian woman, with her thickened speech, her good rolling "r's," her disdain of rhetor
ical rules, her vehemence of expression; her potent unstudied postures, is the most interesting woman I
ever met. She has life, she has courage, she has brains. She is fiercely consistent, unwaveringly true, and
though I can't agree with her, 1 believe -her to be absolutely sincere!
You should hear her talk. It doesn't matter whether you're socialist or anarchist, or.are endowed with
a blessed indifference to isms in general. You can better afford to miss hearing Melba or even Bernhardt than
listening to this genuine creature. She is San Francisco's sensation as she was that of New York and Chi
cago; and next to the departure of the soldiers who marched off to Cuba there is nothing so thrilling as
listening to Emma Goldman. For nothing cows this "woman, who alludes in her full, strong contralto to the
Diety as ''the old gentleman who employs full-stomached idlers, priests, rabbis and ministers. . to mind his
business"; who attacks the press and charges it wi$h the responsibility of the war with Spain; who speaks
mockingly of President McKinley as "a low politician," and says it was honesty among thieves that made
De Lome so express himself, and who then turns upon the people themselves present and taunts them
with their ignorance, their helplessness and their gullibility.
Â¦ . "You â j'ou â you fools!" she cried, "you slaves who prate of humanity! Did you interfere in human- â¢
ity's name when Sheriff Martin and the other murderers, his deputies, shot the strikers down? : Oh, no; ,'
you did nothing of the kind! You believe what you are told to believe; you do what you are told to do.
You stand like cattle before the bulletin boards with the war news. What for, my friends, what for? That
the ruling classes may rejoice: that the yoke may press tighter upon you; that your blood and your : body and
r your purse may suffer. And then you talk of freedom, of liberty!" , , - .
O, the contempt in this woman's voice! O. the power she has over this large, audience that .shouts '"'
bravos and stamps and roars in response to her fiery words! \. "
"As if a workingman could ever be free! Why, you are slaves. And 'the brave boys, the brave .
boys,'" she went on quoting sarcastically, "I say 'the brave boy' who goes to offer himself in battle while his
father sweats at home and his sister sells herself in the streets deserves the lash â and I hope he gets it."
I asked Miss Goldman later if she didn't fear to address men in such terms as this! . '
. " "Never," she answered. "I have talked to wbrkingmen at the mines, in Chicago, during strikes, and
never once was molested." . 'Â¦ .â¢â¢ ,
She doesn't mince words, this fierce, scornful woman. She denounces the present war â all wars â as .
a relic of a barbarous time. She declares the men we honor â Washington, Jefferson. Wendell Phillips â were
not patriots, but rebels. She deplores love of country because it makes one intolerant. " . .
"Do you mean to tell me," she demands, one little hand outstretched and the other braced upon her ;Â¦
hip, "do you mean to tell me it is wise and noble to throw yourselves like wild beasts upon the Spaniards. â¢
and that you'll believe it perfectly wise and perfectly legal and noble, simply because you're told so by the '
press and the pulpit â the pulpit," she sneered, "for war! â and the monopolists and the Government that is not â¢!
by the people, and for the people? They tell you you'd tear yourselves to pieces if you had no leaders. Â¦ Â¦
Who does the: lynching in the South â the white or the black?" â¢ . .â¢
Miss .Goldman's spe'ech is epigrammatic: it is highly quotable. "The world is my., country,", she de- -.:
clares; "to.do good is my only religion." Freedom, freedom is her cry. According to her' creed every, bar- .,...

On the following day as a warning against the effects of the Goldman meetings The. Call

/brought themselves into position in which their lives could be laid bare furnishes an interesting study.
They have usually been found to have lived in violation of the moral law which was in force among
men before national codes were formed, and is understood to restrain men even when they are beyond the Â¦'' \
reach of codes and statutes. Their domestic relations are frequently illicit and their ideas of rights of prop
erty are not derived from the ten commandments. \ â¢
As organized society and the laws of states are based upon the rights of person and property and de
fend the moral foundation of the domestic relations, anarchy lifts its hand against society and against gov
ernment. .
When confronted with such records as are revealed by the arrest of anarchists who have been guilty of
assassination it U their practice to' reply that the moral offenses committed by them are also practiced by
others who profess to support organized society and to support government. .
That is obviously true. But such violators of the moral code are secret sinners, who realize their of
fense and conceal it and shrink from making its practice the social rule by the- destruction of government
and its institutions. .
The spirit of anarchy is one that resists moral restraint, that chafes under the discipline of institu
tions, and strikes impartially at church and state, because each is in its way the agent of morality and dis
cipline.
It would seem, then, that anarchy is the cult of the abnormal man, of the class of atavists who reject
everj'thing that has come into the world with civilization.
Those who publicly propagate it are the apostles of crime, the evangelists of assassination.
Their cry. to the laboring man isftHat he is a slave, and no means are omitted to embitter him and make
him an agent in the destruction of civilization and government.
It needs no profound knowledge, or exalted, intelligence to discern the motives or deny the pre
mises of anarchy. Modern civilization, which it attacks, has lifted the face of labor from the ground and
turned it toward the stars. It has taken labor in the mass out of serfdom into independence, out of a hut into '
a house. It has dotted the nations with schools wherein the sons and daughters of laboring men have been
freely offered the opportunity for a better education than was within the reach of princes a thousand years
ago. ' # Â¦ /Â¦.'.
Government and civilization have put the personal and property rights of labor on exactly the same
footing and under the same judicial protection as the rights of the rich, born in the purple.
The improved economic conditions, due to modern civilization, have put over labor a. shelter, into its
life comforts, and on its table food that were the exclusive possession of royalty and nobility five hundred
years ago. - : ;
So government and social institutions can point to what they have done for < the enfranchisement of
man since the dark ages. To what can anarchy point as its achievements for humanity? To the inno
cent torn, to shreds by dynamite: to the President of a republic murdered in his carriage: to the Czar
who decreed freedom' and, ownership of land to 25.000,000 serfs, assassinated in the streets of St. : Petersburg
to a score of faithful policemen murdered in Haymarket square while doing their duty as protectors of person
and property. What has all this crime and violence done for labor? Has it given wages, shelter, food and
schooling? Has it advanced man a step 1 in the path of further progress which "civHizatiori. has opened for
him? '".-\:- :.; :< \y. '. ~\ Â¦.'Â¦Â¦'.Â¦
â¢Let it blazon its achievements and inform labor of the mighty things it has wrought for those who toil
that the world may strike a balance between murder and civilization as a means for the uplifting of the race
'Such is the full record of the case. The reader will perceive there is nothing in the inter
view with Miss Goldman to incline any, person to listen favorably to her teachings, while the edi
torial in' emphatic terms condemned them by pointing out their _ violation^ not only of the law.s of
government but of God as well. It remains now for the Examiner, ihis maligner of others and
garbler of reports, to venture upon some explanation of its relations to anarchy, and to assassina
tionâand to the publication and indorsement of the following verse: .

PUPIL OF OLD CORTEZI
PROVES A DISCOVERY ON
RETURN FROM CONTINENT
among: them I give it here In full:
I am a good citizen of the United States, and
I deplore the death of the President and the
manner of It as deeply as any other good dtl- .
zen. I perceive as clearly as you the lncon
rniity of public amusements during a period '
of public mourning. But If I close my theater
for a week â there Is no reason that I can seÂ»
why it is more permissible to open It on any
one night during tha^mourning period than on
any . other â I will suffer a pecuniary loss of
from $5000 to $10,000. And I must bear this loss
alone. I cannot so distribute it between my
self, my landlord and my employes that my
personal loss would be merely the loss of my
profit for the week. It would not be fair to do
eo, and the law would not permit me to do so.
I cannot afford this loss. It might bankrupt
me. Now. why should I. more than any other
business man, be asked to prove my sympathy
with the general sorrow by incurring such a
loss and risking bankruptcy? I understand per
fectly that there are occupations to which!
my question does not apply. Â¦ The butchers, thÂ«
grocers, tike bakers, the apothecaries must con*
tlnue to do business in order to supply actual
needs of the public. But to the jewelers. thÂ»
dry goods dealers, the milliners. In short, to)
ninety-nine occupations out of a hundred tha$
are uninterrupted during a period of public
mourning without objection. I think my ques
tion does apply. Their activity during thai
mourning period is no more vitally essential
to the public well being than Is the continuance
of my business. Moreover, note this: If pub-. 1
lie opinion were solidly against me. If there i
were a genuine public aversion to public i
amusement during the period of public mourn
, ing. my theater would, of course. bÂ« closed 1
for obvious reasons. There is no loss In noi
playing to empty benches.
The above statement seem3 to cover th<
ground pretty well, and is a fair and sen
sible presentment of the case for the man
agers. The fact, however, remains tha
a large percentage of the American pur> ,
lie, indubitably composed of those cttl i
zens whom we are content to acknowl
edge as safe leaders in any other ques' .
tion of national import, differ from thÂ«
opinions therein expressed and hold thai
the opening of the theaters at all during
a period of deep mourning like that
through -which the nation has Just Dasset
is a flagrant violation of national pro
prieties. The very practical expressior
of opinion from that other portion of thÂ«
community that partially filled the oner
theaters during the aforesaid period i=Â»
evidence unmistakable on the manaeera '
side. "
It is, of course, a matter of public sent! ,
ment. and to expect that that varying qual
ity shall coincide upon this or any aues
tion is the most altrurianof delusions Bv
it is certainly unfortunate that any ques
tion Involving the growing dignity of the
drama among the arts should arise at th<
present time, and the current discussioa*
has certainly trended in that direction
Many remedies have been suggested b-v
which such undignified differences aa i
have inspired the present controversy
might be obviated, even to the Europear
expedient of ordering a prescribed periofV
of mourning, to be observed by all places!
of amusement alike. But mourning b3
act of Congress will hardly appeal to tha
American public, especially one that ao\
parently discriminates against the busU
ness interests of certain classes of th<Â»
community. It would hardly be possibles
either unless certain conditions that pre
vail in Europe were prevalent here; foo
example, theaters subsidized by the state
or, as in England, the life of the reignlns
sovereign insured by theatrical managers
against their inevitable loss in case of
said rulers' death. And here the question
hangs, that wo have here allowed, with
characteristic good nature or indiffer
en f e vv to s â¬ttle , It5elf . permitting our
neighbor to mind his own business
whether It took him to the theater or to

that every political campaign affords sur

Aspirants for office were eager yester- 1

conferences Friday afternoon and two

conferences, Asa R. Wells was present at
one of the meetings and it Is reported
that Thomas V. Cator was present at an-
Â» other. Burns and Herrin were present
on all occasions. The point in question
was whether Cator or Wells should be
Elated for Mayer. It Is understood that
Herrin inclined strongly toward the in

was discussed in all its bearings the con

the policy which would govern him as

TO LEAD THE TICKET
Frank McGowan, one of the class ini
tiated, delivered a short address on Ma
sonry, which he declared teaches loyalty
to government and fealty to those who
are at the head of the government, and
declared that there is now a new danger
that threatens the nation and that the
viper, anarchy, that is rising from the
sewer â¢ of civilization must be crushed.
When the time came, he said, every
Mason would be ready to-do his duty in
assisting to crush the monster that is
showing its head in this country.
Will H. Crocker then had a few words
to say on the subject of the new hall
which is to be erected on the site of Red
Men's Hall, on Post street, for the Scot
tish Rite. The site, he said, had been se
cured for $110,000, and all but $31,000 of this
amount had been secured. He said that
during the day he had received a letter
Inclosing a check for $15,000 as a subscrip
tion to the stock of the new enterprise.
"Who signed the check?" was -asked
from many parts of the hall.
I : Mr. Crocker then said, "John D. Spreck
els," and what he said after that was
drowned by the clapping of hands and the
stamping of feet, which was kept up for
several minutes. â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦
This event was followed by a banquet,
at which the venerable master of Kadosh
presided as toastmaster. After the black
coffee had been served Charles L. Patton
was called upon for a few remarks. He
spoke of the work that had been per
formed, of the lessons that Masonry teach
and denounced anarchy and "those that
aid it" for having laid low the noblest
Mason that ever lived.

Sullivan immediately increased the force
along the line of docks and adopted rigor

Price and a picked squad were intrusted
with the tasK and they did the work
thoroughly.

Captain Pritchard of the Haddon Hall,
who is also a lieutenant of the British
Royal Naval Reserve, was asked by the
British captain in port to convey to the
police authorities an expression of the
blessings of the lately found peace. The
following is his letter: ;
Chief of Police Sullivan has received an
indorsement of his policy in preserving
the peace of the water front from the
masters of British ships occupying berths
along the city front. These men have had
to pay their full share of tribute to thje

Rowland and Carlson Axe Released on
Charles Rowland and Axel G. Carlson,
strikers, who were indicted by- the Grand
Jury Friday, were arrested yesterday and
taken to the County Jaii. They were re
leased on $500 bonds. each. â¢Â¦-: : ?V;
Rowland is accused of robbery'commit
ted on Special Officer *A. Cochrane and the
case has been before Judge Cabaniss. It
was on his calendar yesterday, but as he
had not been otHcialiy notified of the ac
tion of the Grand Jury he continued it
until October 3. There is another case of
robbery against Rowland before Cabaniss.-
Carlson is charged with assault to mur
der for shooting at Special Officer Furey
on the Oceanic dock. His case was before
Judge FMtz, and was stricken from his
calendar yesterday owing to the action of
the Grand Jury.
Robert Ellis, a striking teamster, who
was arrested on a charge of assault to
murder, appeared before Judge Cabaniss
yesterday and the care was continued for
a week to give the police a chance to ar
rest three other strikers who are wanted
for the eame offense. The complaining
witness Is Thomas Coatello, a non-union
teamster for Magner & Scott. On Sep
tember 17 he was dragged from a buggy
by four men and struck over the head
with a bottle. He identified Ellis' as one
of his assailants.
FIRED UPON STRIKERS,
vlctim of the strikers' cruelty last night.
He was taking a drink in a Third-street
saloon, when a dozen or more strikers
rushed in on him crying "scab" and beat
and kicked him into unconsciousness. Sul
livan says he is not a non-union man â in
fact, is not employed anywhere.
Special Officer Morton Resants At-
tack "With Revolver.
Much excitement was caused at the
corner of Third and Tehama streets by
the firing of two pistol shots at 5:3d
o'clock last evening. The trouble was
caused by a ouartet of strikers in the
St. DaVid's House, who threw bottles at
Special Officer Morton, who was guarding
a teamster in the employ of the Union
Transfer Company, and who fired his re
volver twice at the window -in which the
strikers were clustered.
The St. David's House is at 715 Howard
street, and it has also an entrance on
Tehama street. While the special was
conducting the teamster past the rear of
the building four men appeared at a win
dow on the second floor and hurled sev
eral bottles at the teamster and his es
cort. The latter drew his revolver and
fired quibkly without, however, hitting
any of the men. An attempt was then
made to enter the building, but before the
door could be unlocked the men had fled.
They are known to be reckless characters
and they will be arrested on sight.

Harry Rosseter Arrested on Com

Death of Milton E. Babb.
Milton E. Babb, formerly an attorney
of this city, died Friday at his home in
Raymond, Madera County. He went
there about a year and a half ago, a suf
ferer from lung troubles, being compelled
to give up active practice. He was a na
tive of Hardy County, Virginia, and 47
years of age. He arrived in California in
1877 and was admitted to practice in 1SS0.
His most noted case was the prosecution
before the Grand Jury of the forgery
charges against John K. Moore. A widow
survives him.
Harry Rosseter of the firm of J. T. Ros
seter & Co. was arrested yesterday on a
warrant sworn to by Con Donahue, a sa
loon-keeper, charging him with an assault
to commit murder.
About a week ago Rosseter was leaving
the company's coalyard, at 524 First
street, when he was attacked by a gang
of strikers. Drawing a club Rosseter,
who a short time ago was appointed a
special policeman, charged his assailants
and soon put them to flight. Donahue,
who conducts a saloon contiguous to the
scene of the fight, went to the rescue of
the beaten strikers and was himself
knocked out, receiving an ugly* gash in
the head. After waiting until yesterday
Donahue appeared before Judge Fritz and
swore to a warrant for the arrest of Ros
seter. The latter was at once released on
$2000 bonds.
A short time ago Bosseter was attacked
by a gang of strikers, who endeavored to
break his arm. He managed to free him
self from them, but not until they had
severely injured his wrist.
PICKETS MAKE AN "ARREST."
Union Headquarters.
Quartermaster Gillen "Does Time" at
John Gillen, a quartermaster employed
by the Pacific Mail Company, asserts that
he was on Friday "arrested" by union
pickets and .taken to the headquarters of
the City Front Federation; He was de
tained there from 5 until 11 o'clock p. m.
Prior to his "arrest" he and two ship
mates -were attacked by union pickets.
The others got away. Gillen was again
attacked near the door of the Mail dock
when returning from his incarceration,
but the appearance on' the scene of Cap
tain Anderson put his assailants to flight.
Samuel- Batten, chief steward of the
steamship City of Panama, was- held up
Friday night about a half-block aÂ»-ay
from the Mail dock by a band of union
pickets. After cross-examining him they
refused to allow him passage along Bran
nan street and ordered him back to the
dock. Unarmed and outnumbered, he was
obliged to obey and compelled to spend
the night on board ship.
Assaults on Non-TJnion Hen.
Matthew Paulson, a teamster in the em
ploy of the Union Transfer Company, was
the victim of a brutal assault at Second
and Harrison streets at 6 o'clock last
night. He was returning to the stables of
the company, and while passing under the
Harrison street bridge some hoodlums on
the bridge I hurled several missiles down
upon him. He was struck on the head -with
a stone and suffered a laceration of the
scalp. He fell unconscious, and on being
picked up was taken to St. Â» Mary's Hos
pital, where his wound was dressed.
Lee Moody, a driver for the California
Wine Association, was viciously assaulted
about 11 o'clock last' night at the corner
of Golden Gate avenue and Market street
by a crowd of striking teamsters. Moody
and a friend nad just turned into Golden
Gate avenue when he was struck by one
of three men w^o were following him. He
turned and ran through the crowd, across
Market street and into a saloon at the
corner of. Sixth and. Mission streets. One
of the same gang followed him and
knocked him In a heap in a corner of the
barroom, besides tearing down some of
the furnishing. The striker escaped.
Moody came here from San Jose.
George' Keeran, a lumber pller, was at
tacked by a crowd of strikers at Sixth
and Folsom streets ' at ' * 11 o'clock last
night. He was beaten almost "insensible.
Both his eyes were closed and four scalp
wounds Inflicted, v His assailants accused
htm of being a non-union teamster and
after beating him they robbed him of a
$35 gold watch. - While Keeran was being
beaten he saw another gang ( beating a
non-union man but a few yards away.

The police station was notified of the
riot, but it was all over before Lieutenant
Price's men reached the scene. As a re
sult of the continued violence in the neigh-'
borhood of the Mail dock the police will
take away the licenses of at least four
saloons. The action of the street ear con
ductors on duty on the cars running to
the Mall dock and accused Of pointing out
non-union men to the pickets will also be
investigated. . â¢ . . - Â¦
The union pickets stationefl in the vicin
ity of the Pacific Mail dock were on Fri
day night attacked and severely beaten
by half a dozen of the victims of their
own violence. The pickets in this neigh
borhood have besn conspicuous for their
activity. Hardly a night has passed with
out its victim. Six of these victims, in
jured earlier in the strike and now recov
ered, banded together on Friday for the
purpose of forcing on the pickets a dose
of their own medicine. The fight was
short but lively, and yesterday those pick
ets whose feet and lists have been most
active in the service of the City Front
Federation were conspicuous for the band
ages with which the attendants at St.
Mary's Hospital had eqvered up the cuts
and bruises received in â¢ the previous

Non-Union Victims Bout Branch, of
James McNab of McNab & Smith as
serts that his firm is doing more than its
usual amount of business. C. W. Baird,
manager of the Overland Freight Trans
fer Company, said his firm had eighty
four teams out and would have the full
complement of 100 if. business warranted
it. The "Western Transfer Company
claims to be doing its usual amount of
business, while the Morton Drayage and
Warehouse Company places the business
it is doing at 75 per cent of the normal
amount. The G. W. Emmons Company
places its business at the same per cent
age. The Stetson-Renner .Company has
almost reached the average of business
done before the strike. F. D. Schuyler,
manager of the Independent Employment
Bureau, says that all applications for
teamsters have been filled with the Â¦ ex
ception of applications for men able to
drive four-horse trucks and to handle
baled hay.
For the first time since the beginning of the
strike the employers are in a position to exer
cise discrimination in the choice of applicants
for positions. A gradual weeding out of in
competent men is going on, and the efficiency
of those who are tilling the strikers' place; is
increasing. All the firms report that the new
men exhibit as great adaptability to the work
as the former employes except in the cases
of special lines, which require long experience.
They are confident that in a short time all gen
eral lines of work will be handled as rap'.dly
and as carefully as they were by the old
employes.
Regarded from. the employers' view the situ
ation is in every way satisfactory. Out of
1044 wagons in use bafore the strike by mem
bers of the association our reports show that
over 950 are. employed. This number could be
increased considerably if the. state of business
warranted it. Nearly all of the smaller con
cerns and some of the larger ones are transact
ing business up to their normal capacity. We
have no difficulty in securing drivers or spe
cial policemen.
For the week ending Saturday, September 28,
the Draymen's Association reports a satisfac
tory increase in the business of Its members
In nearly every line and a gradual return to
the normal state of affairs as they were be
lore the strike. According to figures furnlbhed
the association headquarters by its members
92 per cent of the teams and wagons In use
before the beginning; of the strike are now
engaged in transporting merchandise. Some
of the firms are employing more teams than
they did before the beginning of the trouble
and none of them are running under 70 per
cent of the usual amount. The smaller con
< ems. as a general rule, have attained a high
er percentage toward a return to normal con
ditions than the larger firms, due to the lact
that they have b"een less troubled by fears of
violence.
The following statement was issued last
night by George Renner, manager of the
Draymen's Association:
the coming week, and the employ
ers say that the long-expected break in
the ranks of the union teamsters will not
be long deferred. On the other hand, the
strike leaders say their followers are just
as determined as ever not to return to
work until their demands are conceded. \
THE week ended uneventfully so
far as the strike situation is con
cerned. The air is full of predic
tions of what will occur early In

Governor Dole Virtually Re-
pudlates DeolBlon of tho
Supremo Tribunal.
HONOLULU, Sept. 21.-There is ground
for believing that Oovwrnor Dole haa
come to a decision virtually repudiating
the HawtUInn Supreme Court decisions
creating ft legal transition period wherein
the United States constitution did not
operate In the Hawaiian Islands. This
period, under tho Supreme Court rulings,
existed from the passage of the annexa
tion resolution, July 7, 1S9S, to the Inaug
uration of tho Territory of Hawaii under
act of Congress June 14, 1900.
George A. Davis was one of the attor
neys In the habeas corpus proceedings ln
stittited for the release of prisoners con
victed and sentenced within that period
on the ground that they had not been In
dicted by a Grand Jury, nor were thever
dicts of the petty Juries unanimous for
their conviction. The Territorial Circuit
Court and the United States District
Court released the prisoners on writs of
habeas corpus, but before a case was
brought before the Federal Court the Su
preme Court entertained appeals from the
orders of the Circuit Court and remanded
certain of the prisoners to Jail, holding
that their convictions were legal.
Owing to the absence of Attorney Gen
eral E. P. Dole, who is ln San Francisco,
and a crowded state of the Circuit Court
calendar existing. Attorney . Davis has
been commissioned as a special deputy of
the Attorney General to prosecute crimi
nal cases at a special term before Judge
Gear.
George Wade, who killed a fellow stew
ard on the steamship Australia In 1893,
and four of the Japanese rioters at Ka
huku plantation were released on habeas
corpus from sentences for manslaughter.
They were immediately rearrested on
warrants charging them with murder in
the flrst degree, though Federal Judge
Estee who released one of them, said
there was nothing to prevent their rear
resting on the original charges, as they
had cot been legally placed in Jeopardy.
In â¢ tha course of proceedings yesterday
Deputy- Attorney General Davis said:
"I am authorized to state officially that
the policy of the Government in theae
cases will be to follow the rulings of the
Circuit Court and of the United States
District Court, and to endeavor to reln
dlct all thoso convicted and sentenced
during the so-called transition period."
Attorney Davis mado the announcement
on high authorify and it is confidently
asserted that this authority Is Governor
Dole.
The four Japanese rioters declined to
plead to the Indictment on the advice of
F. M. Brooks, their attorney. This action
Is taken to mean tbnt new habeas corpus
proceeding* nre contemplated on the
strength of the Supreme Court's decisions,
but ln view of the statement made by the
public prosecutor, Davis, it Is not proba
ble that an attempt will be made to block
their trial.
Ah Oi, a Chinese burglar, wan released
by Judge Geur yesterday on habeas cor
pus from imprisonment continued by vir
tue of the decision of the Supreme Court.
Thla wns prior to the statement of Gov
ernment Attorney Davla. Judge Gear
says that ho made the order of release in
accordance with tho decision of the
United States District Court.

TO TAKE PLACE
OF OLD FUELS
Tesla Company , Com
mences Manufacture
of Briquettes.
New Industry Destined to
Be of Advantage to
California.
In Europe and In Chicago, where the
only other similar factory in' this coun
try is located, the making of briquettes
haa been attended with considerable In
convenience and expense on account of a
heavy waste of materials. This difficulty
has by the perfection of machinery been
entirely obviated by the Stockton people.
Not an ounce of coal or oil la lost at any
step ln the process,
The coat of briquettes is about the same
as that of common forms of fuel.' A ton
of the new product, however, will last oh
lone at least as one and a quarter tons of
coal, j The heat efficiency, too,. Is said to
be BO per cent great or.
That a groat deal of heat Is ordinarily
lost in the combustion of coal la a well
known scientific fact. How to remedy
this defect haa been the source of count
lens Investigations and chemical experi
ment h. A 1 number of these' efforts have
proved partially successful and so far as
la known the experts employed by the
Ban Francisco tÂ«nd Ban Joaquln Coal
In making the briquettes, the coal is
first pulverized by powerful crushers. Tho
oil which is the binder is then treated
chemically and the residue Is mixed with
the coal dust at a very high temperature.
The composition Is immediately passed in
gigantic hoppers into the presses. There
the material Is shaped into briquettes
which are in the form of oblate spheroids
from three to four Inches ln diameter.
After cooling they are ready for the mar
ket. The presses, two in number, are
each capable of turning out 250 tons of
briquettes dally. â¢ All the machinery is
covered by patents, as is also the process
of manufacture. . . â¢ .
The company's plant is located on .the
wuter front in Stockton, where the bri
quettes can be easily shipped to any
point. Adjacent are the bunkers of tti3
Tesla Coal Company, to which a railroad
thirty-six miles In length and owned by
the corporation, conveys the output of th*
Tesla mines. Every tning has oeeu iu
ranged in an admirably convenient man
ner and all materials are handled careful
ly i and expeditlously. The simplicity of
tho entire arrangement engages one's at
tention immediately.
The San Francisco and San Joaquln
Coal Company Is parent of the enterprlso
and the business of brlquettlng is bulnij
conducted on, a large and constantly in
creasing scale.
Furthermore it affords another outlet
for the supply of oil in which the State Is
found to be so rich. Another pleasing fea
ture about the briquette is that it is dean
and can be handled freely without leav
ing a trace of Its presence. . â¢
The. capitalists at the head of the ven
ture have had chemists working ' for a
period covering about three years in an
effort to secure a satisfactory fuel. The
principal difficulty lay ln finding a proper
binder for the screenings. ln Europe
pitch or coal tar Is used, but oil scientlii
cally treated has proved to be of far
greater efficiency.
That the general use of the briquette
will prove ot the utmost value to Califor
nia is evidenced from the fact that the
process enables the screenings and slack,
which has previously been ot little value,
to be utilized as a domestic coal. Mil
lions of tons of slack are thrown awuy
annually ln the United States. The bn
quetting process will doubtless be uaed to
save a great amount of this fuel.
In point of economy and effectivem-a*
the briquette surpasses coal and othqr
fuels, and Judging from the rapidity with
which the public is adapting Its use theru
would seem little doubt that the Inaugu
ration of the new Industry marks an tru
In the progress of the West. Several of
the larjjer nations of Europe have been
using the briquette as a fuel for sums
years and scientists throughout America
have been attempting as usual to make
a superior article. ' To California belong:*
the honor of success. A briquette Is now
being manufactured at Stockton which is
said to be tar in advance of anything vt
the kind ever before placed on the mar
ket. Coal screenings or slack and oil
are the chief components of tne product.
Tho process of manufacture is very sim
ple and the materials are, of course inex
pensive.
A new fuel ln the thane .of coal
briquettes Is being manufactured and unld
In California, and It ts a matter ot groat
public Inturcst n* to whother this product
la to come Into general use ln homes ari
well as In factories and on locomottvud
and nteambonts. From preoent indica
tions It, appears that euch Is to be tho
case.
Pasadena Is fearful of experiencing: a lack of
accommodations for the promised rush of win
ter tourists. Although a large number of
apartment houses and dwellings have been
constructed and other* are In course of com
pletion. The demand even at this early day
senna to be greater than the supply. Many
Eastern people who have mado that city their
home during the winter months and were pa
trons of the various hotels have purchased
property and provided residences for their own
use, but still the Increasing number arriving
tax thH capacities of the hotels to their utmost.
KurtilBhed apartments arc almost out of the
market, and It seems rs though a rich harvest
Is ln view for all those who can furnish ac
commodations for temnorary lojoumers. The
â¢ame ccndltlon of things may be said to exist
In Lios Angeles to a marked derreÂ». taodglnar
house keepers report business brisker In their
line at present than It haa been for many
years, although many large and commodious
apartment houses and- flats have been con
structed during the past year. Considering the
fact that the winter travel to this section has
hnrJly commenced, It looks as though Los An
geles will be taxed heavily to furnish the re
quired accommodations for visitors during the
next few month*. â¢ .
The Los Angeles papers tell of lively
efforts ln Southern California to make
ready for the coming Eastern winter visi
tors, for whom there Is insufficient ac
commodation. The Los Angeles Building
News says that E. S. Rowley is preparing
plans for not less than forty residences
to bo erected on Normandie. avenue. The
Los Angeles Journal has the following:

All realty broken In the city agree In
the pleasing statement that realty Is
again Improving. Clients are more eager
and the demand for business end resi
dence properties is good. There has been
less demand for smaller priced lots for
cheap residences In certain localities. The
lists of sales are again Increasing and the
figures Involved are satisfactory to the
sellers. Among the larger sales of the
last few days Is Included the transfer of
the southeast corner of Howard and Hub
bard streets for $42,500. The lot Is 79:6x
112 feet and there Is an L. In the rear. The
Improvements are old buildings of little
value. The deal was made through the
agency of Thomas Mageo & Sons.

Fannie U. Ralston, 62S Lexington ave., New-
port, Ky.. cays: "when I began using Mme.
Kibault's complexion beautlflera I did not
think it possible to dear my skin; my face waa
tn a horrible condition, literally covered with
red epots, pimples, blackheads, moth patches
and freckles. I suffered a thousand deaths,
and when I sent for a trial of Mme. Rlbault's
beautlflers I improved no wonderfully that my
friends did not recognize me, so quickly had
the change taken place. My skin Is now per-
fectly lovely, and there la not a blemish or
wrinkle anywhere." .

Frank Murphy, a peaceable barber, who
conducts a shop at Third and Minna
streets, was brutally beaten last night by
men who, he alleges, were strikers.
Murphy was at the corner of Third and
Howard streets when several men asked
him If he was a union man. He said he
was, and then they asked him what he
did. Before Murphy could reply he was
knocked down and so badly injured by his
assailants that he had to be taken to the
Emergency Hospital.

Southern Pacific and Detective Ryan of
the local police were detailed on the case.
They discovered that Erdmann had sold
quantities of brass to a foundry on Beale
street, and Lewin engaged a room in a

Erdmann enter the foundry with a sack
ful of brass and placed him under arrest
after a struggle. Lewin recovered 18J0
pounds of brass from the foundry which
Erdmann had stolen and sold.
Erdmann some years ago was employed
by the Southern Pacific Company. He has
invented a patent switch and it was to
get money to perfect the patent that he
robbed the railroad company. He is about
40 years of age. Â¦. "
.Possibly -because It -is" so near to-.us, so
easily accessible by; boat -and .'train, the
major part of the residents of San Fran

'within -an hour from the Market-street
ferries there is one of tne most beautiful
mountain railway trips to be had on the
face, of the earth. -However experienced
the "globe trotter, from . whatever section,
of the planet he may have commenced his
wanderings, always you will hear it said
from such an one, "this is- divinely beau
tiful. Nowhere else such intricate wind

sea and smiling .towns!" Tamalpais on a
clear day affords such beauties. In scenic
changes as no other mountain offers, and
yet the railway: which snakes the trip pos
sible is but indifferently patronized, ex
cept by tourists. - - .
Heretofore the rate from San Francisco
has been forty; cents to Mill Valley and
return, and one dollar from Mill Valloy
to the summit and return. The Board of
Railroad Commissioners has approved of
an increase in this schedule and henceforth
the round trip from San Francisco will be
$190, or $150 for- the -round .trip between
Mill Valley and the summit.' The trip up
the mountain is eight and a fifth miles. A
comparison of prices is interesting, â¢ the
distances and rates on tne various moun
tain roads being as follows: Mount Wash

round trip $4; Pilatus, Switzerland, three
miles long, $2 40; Schynlgle Platte, Switz

The Southern Pacific^
. It ;ls supposed that Harriman as the
new president' will' go In for a' sweeping
reform; in regard to the expenses of the
company. This is very evident from' tha
fact' that 'he ; has accepted; the , post of
president and is going to knuckle down to
hard work himself. Around the "yellow
building", it is said that ' consolidations
are'.nowl sure to come^ fast ' and :Â¦ thick.
Salaries --will' not "be lowered,- but â¢ where
an official -or even a clerk can do more
work it will certainly be. forced upon him
Those ; railroad officials in. .the Southern
Pacific Company in- this city who picked
out either Felton. or Burt as the next
president; are .sadly . disappointed. Every
railroad man' earning a large salary will
have to stand on his merits. Weekly re
ports will 'be forwarded to Harrlman and
those who. are found wanting will soon
get their notices of dismissal. . . .
It is generally believed that Evsrltte
Sf John of the Seaboard line will fill the
position of assistant to President Harri

was out here. He left the early part of

GRE Â£* -WALL- STREET RAILROAD MANIPULATOR WHO IS TO BE THJD NEW PRESIDENTcOF THE SOUTH
The news that Harriman Is to be the
next president of the Southern Pacific
Company came as a great, and dismal
surprise to the prominent officials of the
company in this city, who had been" notl-
Jied from New York of the fact. With
Harrlman as president of the road the
manipulations, workings and entire inter
nets will bÂ« centered in New York. The
road is now entirely owned by Eastern
capital. The policy of the road will be
dictated from Wall street end the officials
Belief Is General Here That He "Will
Be Appointed.'
ST. JOHN ASSISTANT.
For the same reason S. M. Felton of the
Chicago and Alton road also refused to
accept the position. Harrlman made sev
eral offers to Felton. assuring him that
At he would accept the position of presi
dent of the Southern Pacific he would sign
a long contract. Felton. however, abso
lutely refused to accept the place, owing
to the fact that the president of the
Southern Pacific Company was no longer
able to direct his own traffic department.
"Who Harrlman will send out to the
coast as his assistant has not yet been
announced.. The railroad man who ac
cepts the position will not receive a sal
ary as high as that given Charles M.
Hays The assistant will simply represent
Mr. Harriman on the coast and will refer
all matters direct to him In New York.
Financiers say that Harrfman as presi
dent of the Southern Pacific will be Â«
great success. He will take an active In
terest in the vast 'corporation and make
many improvements that are sadly need
ed. He will both remodel the rold and
expend vast sums in rolling-stock.
On Wall street the news was received
Â¦with Burprlse end eagerly discussed. It
Is generally conceded that Harrlman will
Step in as president of the Southern Pa
dfle Company solely upon motives of
economy. "With the appointment of J. C.
Stabbs as traffic director of the Harri
man- eystem of roads most of the respon
sibility is gone from the office of presi
dent of the Southern Pacific Company. It
is definitely known to-day In New York
that Charles M. Hays handed in his res
ignation as president the moment J. C.
Stufcbs was appointed traffic director by
Harrlman. He deemed that with the
traffic business taken from his control
and placed In the hands of Stubbs in Chi
cago the "place originally attractive was
much less so."

man to go to Ban Francisco and fill the

ONE of ' the most desperite

a/1 NARCHY has asserted itself in this city. Blood has been
u^~ji shed and life lias probably been taken upon the leading thor
oughfare of San Francisco. This morning an armed body <?/,
strikers opened -fire upon special policemen at the corner of Market,
and Geary streets. The fire tea? answered by the pistols of the spe
cial officers, and for a few minutes one oÂ£ the. most outrageous scenes
in the history of this city zvas perpetrated. ' The excitement was at
-fever heat zvhile the combatants howled and yelled and the- crack <?/,
their revolvers affrighted the pedestrians wlio were so unfortunate
,as to be in the neighborhood. Fifty strikers, every one .' of them
yinncd and bent on murder, had followed five special police officers
around town, zvhile the Rev. Peter C. Yorke, under the chaperoning
zving of Andrczu Furuseth, zvas patrolling the water front to fer
suadc himself that murderous assaults, cowardly assassinations
and deadly rioting arc fictions in San Francisco.
The murderous strikers followed their victims for hours, and at.
Market and Kcarny streets assaulted them. The attacking force <?/}
murdcrous-minded men.numbered fifty, and their victims were five.
When the deadly battle, without parallel in the history of San Fran
cisco, or perhaps any other American metropolis, was over, three men
zeere dangerously zvounded and others zvere * being carried away
from the place. in order that their identity might not be revealed nor.
the character of tlieir zvounds made knozvn. .
When this extraordinary street battle began pandemonium
reigned. Affrighted citizens who' happened to be in the neighbor
hood rushed terror-stricken into dborzvays or any ; other convenient
place that promised safety. Police officers hurried to the spot, ambu*
lances zvcre summoned, the zvounded zvere carried away, and the stain
of a fearful outrage was upon the city. In the words of x the Rev %
-Peter C. Yorke," WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN"?
Are these the deeds zvhich the reverend gentleman urged th&
.strikers of San Francisco to do? Does this mean, in the words of the
- Rev. Peter C. Yorke, that it matters little what strikers may say, for,
the time for saying is past and that the only things that count are
deeds ? Is this terrible outrage, this extraordinary warfare, com
mitted in a civilized community in the blackness of the night, the di
rect result of the following dread words of the Rev. Peter C.
Yorke: "VIOLENCE IS TO BE REPROBATED WHEN THE
LA W PROTECTS YOU: BUT IF THE LA W. BE PERVERT-

Carter on a foul after nineteen rounds
of heavy fighting. Carter will leave to

come to this city on the day of the fight.
"Walcott will train at Larkspur, where

to match him against Walcott. Martin
is the clever colored heavyweight who
acts as Ruhlln's sparring partner*
Tom O'Rourke attached Gardner's share
of the receipts. The struggle for the coin
will be fought out in the courts. O'Rourke
claims Gardner owes him more than J200o,
a debt contracted when the boxer was
under his management. Gardner must
have had an intimation of O'Rourke's in
tention as he had already assigned it to
his friend, Alex Greggains, '.before the
legal documents in the matter were served
on him. Â¦
The attendance at the Pavilion on Fri
day night was the largest in many years.
According to the figures of the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club It was a $7951 house.
The club's share was $3975 50 and the
same amount was apportioned to Walcott
and Gardner. The colored fighter re
ceived $2981 60 and Gardner took the los
er's end cf the purse, J9S3 90.
Both men were around town yes
terday none the worse for their en
counter. Nothing, in their personal
appearance would indicate that either
had been battered to any extent.
Gardner was disappointed in not win
ning and expressed a willingness to- fight
his dusky opponent again . for a side
bet of $1000. walcott, on the other hand,
was as jubilant as. a email boy with a
toy cannon. He said he was not dodging
challenges and was ready to take on the
next man. The contract between Walcott
and: his old macager. Torn O'Rourke, hav
ing expired, both men will go their re
spective ways. Waleott will be managed
by Young Aiitchell during his stay in this
city.
There was little fault found with the
decision of "Jack" "Welsh, who refereed
t-e Gardner- Walcott fight on Friday
night. A majority of the ring-goers were
satisfied that Walcott deserved a victory
and only the strongest Gardner adherents
thought differently. Some believed a
draw could have been declared, but as
a decision had to be given, it was a just
one.

Berkeley relied on the kicking of Its

could make but. little advance through Re
liance's line. Mini and Duden being the
only men of the blue and gold team to
make any impression there. The team
play Â¦ was too loose and too uncertain to
have any marked effect. - '-Â¦ - '
Rodolph of Reliance tried Kaarsburg's
famous kangaroo jump, going over the
center several times for good gains. ,,
Contrary to expectations, there were
senting University of California
and Stanford University were played yes
terday, jj At Berkeley the opposing teams
were those of University of California and
the Reliance Athletic Club team. Neither
team was able to score. :-. '
The game attracted a large attendance
of students. They cheered the college
eleven in all their successful efforts at
gaining ground. A large and enthusiastic
crowd of rooters practiced 'on their favor
ite yells under the direction of leaders
who handled them as skillfully as the
Jeader of an orchestra controls his men
with his baton. The college band en
livened the occasion with its melody, ren
dering several. marches and quicksteps.
â¢ The field has been, carefully prepared
and is surrounded with a new fence. A
large uncovered stand provides seats for
a. thousand spectators, and bleachers of
a like capacity will also be erected.
The game was an unusually fast one for
the first of the year. There was an ab
sence of concerted team work, which was
to be expected owing to the short time
In which the men have been playing to
gether. Manager "Pete" Smith of Re

to retire them from the game. In the sec

chiefly for practice. The day was entirely
too warm from the players' point of

Its game by mass plays on guard and
tackle. When it lost the ball to the Berke

kicking for advancing. _
The nearest to a score was at the end
of the first half, when Berkeley had the
ball on Reliance's six-yard line. Having
failed by one yard of making the neces
sary five-yard gain, it lost the ball, which
was then kicked in^p midfleld.
Shortly before the end of the half, Re

side play by Hamilton, v/ho started be

The features of the second half were a
fifty-yard kick by Stow and a thirty-yard
punt by Rodolph on the third "down' for
Reliance. The ball was fumbled by Dib

at this time, thirty-five yards around
right end. Smith failed to gain, Slaker
bucked for a. two-yard gain and Hill re
peated , his action around right: end - for
ten. yards more. . Hill's playing at this
stage of the game was the best of the af
ternoon. He carried the ball over the line
for a touchdown and Traeger kicked the
goal. Score: Stanford 6. Olympic 0. .
Cadwallader then kicked off to Hill, who
ran twenty yards. Hill kicked to Gam

kicked to Raitt and Hill returned soon
after with a forty-yard kick to Smith,

ended.
Cadwallader opened the second half for
the Olympics with a kick-off to Smith,

especially grood. "Locomotive'- Smith was
the Olympic star; Gammon and Clay also
did good work. Cutter's kicking was a
feature of the game,' his longest punt be
ing a free kick of seventy yards from the
Olympic's twenty-flve-yard line. The
heaviness of the clubmen's line was prob
ably responsible for the score being no
larger than it was. The ball was in
Olympic territory most of the time.
Stanford won the toss. Traeger kicked
off to Gutter, who ran the ball in nearly
forty yards and then fumbled it, Boren,
Stanford's left end, falling on the ball.
End runs by Smith and Fisher netted
Stanford twenty yards. "Fluffy" Trae
ger tried a place kick for goal from the
twenty-flve-yard line, but it failed by a
small margin. This gave the clubmen a
free kick from the twenty-flve-yard line.
Cutter's good right foot hit the ball
squarely and it landed on Stanford's flf
teen-yard-line. a punt of seventy yards,
the longest of the game. Fisher kicked
back, after Slaker's fumble and- recover,
and. Olympic lost to the cardinal on
downs shortly after. Barnheisel' s good
work against big Cadwallader was par

half. Fisher and Cutter exchanged punts

Both twirlers were in good form and
Â¦were accorded fair support. "Chimmie"
behaved himself life a -little Lord Faun
tleroy. though Hardie was mean at times.
Kihm's catch of Wilson's hard drive be
tween first and second In the seventh was
ope of ths greatest ever made on the
grounds. The score:
The ..Dutch made their first two runs in
the sixth round. ' Nordyke got a base on
balls and went to third on Wilson's two
bagger. Hlldebrand hit a high infleld fly.
which Reitz, through overconridence,
missed, and the sacks were full. The
fans cheered themselves hoarse when
Pabst hit a short fly along the right field
line. Dougherty failed to field it in time,
and both Wilson and Xordvke scored,
amid the great cheering of. one of the
largest Saturday crowds of the season..
Once more the bell sounded in honor of
the Wasps In the eighth round. Hilde
brand got a free ticket, went to second on
Schwartz's sacrifice and completed the
circuit on Krug's hitâ "Heine's" third safe
drive during the. game. i
Like the two previous days, I>os Angeles'
started off in a great nutter, which they
were unable to maintain. Dougherty be
gan the game with a clean hit, went to
third on Reitz's single and ambled over
the home plate on Hemphill's hard drive,
which forced "Oriole" Reitz at second.
This ended the run-getting for the Angels.
Only one more hit was made off Wbalen
during the remainder of the contest. The
I>utch did little better.
As the pennant race progresses and the
games wax fast and furious it begins to
look as though Horley's redlegs will find
the German aggregation a stumbling
block in their way. Yesterday afternoon
at Recreation Park Los Angeles failed to
connect safely with "Chlmmie" Whalen's
curves and shoots, and as a consequence
only made onÂ© single tally, while the men
who bear the standard of Uncle. Hank
made three trips. Reltz's error of Hilde
brand's infield fly In the sixth, coupled
with Dougherty's failure to go after
Pabst's drive along the right lield line,
proved the undoing of the sluggers from
the land of sunshine.

alleges that his partner. Dr. William G.

ship agreement under which they were
practicing, and prays the court to issue
a restraining order preventing Mizner
from taking possession of the office Â¦ on
Larkin street until such time as the suit
Is decided. â¢ Â¦Â¦ > -
Dr. Hicks alleges that he is the owner
of the office fixtures, books and instru
ments at 105 Larkin street, and that he
took Dr. Mizner into partnership in May,
1900, with the understanding that he was
to share In the profits of the business, and
that if he wished to purchase any of the
furnishings of the office he could obtain
them at cost price. They continued In
partnership until September of this year,*
when Dr. Hicks determined to carry on
the business alone.
He notified Dr. Mizner of his determi
nation, and asked him for money which
he alleges Mizner owed him. Mizner,
Hicks further alleges, did not take to the
separation plan kindly, but took forcible
possession of the office and refused to
allow him to enter therein, and threatened
personal violence.

CASE IS FULL
OF SENSATIONS
After the conclusion of the lecture bev
eral musical numbers, vocal and instru
mental, brought the evening's entercain
ment to an end.
Continuing, Father Shahan analyzed
the conditions existing in Ireland at the
time Robert Emmet came into the
world's affairs and eloquently told of the
patriot's. work as a man and a benefactor
for all his people. The lecture was in
teresting and provoked much applause.
It gives me great pleasure to speak to you
tot one of God's noblemen, the Irishman tcob
ert Emmet. Robert Emmet died for his poun
try. That is his title to fame and gratitude.
Robert Emmet - died for Ireland.
When the Mayer did sit down some one
in the gallery asked for three cheers for
Father Yorke. They followed at once.
Then somebody suggested three cheers for
th Mayor, and the other side of the house
came in line. That was the end of the dis
turbance, and the scheduled work of the
evening went on.
Father Shahan began his lecture as fol
lows: -
This he did, but those more than two
rows away from the stage were unable to
hear him on at count of the mingling of<
plaudits and the sibilant outbursts. The
Mayor fought it out.' He referred to Irish
politeness, appealed to the citizens of San
Francisco to give a Â¦ proper and cordial
greeting to the lecturer, mentioned the
name of Robert Emmet and finally ended
by saying he would not leave the platform
until he had asked for at least a show of
respect to the guest of the. evening. But
very few heard even this short speech, for
the confusion was great.
The unusual position in which he was
placed brought a strange look of discom
fiture to the Mayor's face. He was for sit
ting down and allowing the storm' to pass
o%'er his head, but his friends on the stage
bade him go on and finish.
When Mayor Phelan stepped to the
front of the platform- he -was greete-1
with a round of applause, but running
through this demonstration of good will
was a sustained wave of hissing. The
Mayor attempted to speak. The hissing
continued, growing in intensity everv sec
ond. Thenkhe hall became divided, and
between the plaudits and the hissing the
Mayor's efforts at speech-making were
submerged. ...... ; . â .
Archb!3hop ltiordan was prograrmne.l
for the opening . remarks. His Grace
came to the hall fully Intending Â¦ to oili-'
ciate, but being seized with illness before
leaving his carriage he returned to his
home. Father Crowley introduced the
Mayor as the master -of ceremonies, ex
pressing regret and sorrow at the indis
position of Archbishop Riordan.
Mayor James D. Phelan,- taking the
place of Archbishop Riordan, was the
mark for recurrent hissing and hooting
last night at the reception given to the
Rev. JJv. Shahan at Metropolitan Hall.
Father Shahan delivered a lecture on
Robert Emmet, and as a testimonial of
respect and esteem the Ancient Order of
Hibernians tendered a formal receptioa
to the noted prlest'and teacher. On the
stage were university professors, noted
lay citizens and prominent prelates. The
large auditorium was packed to the
doors. f \ :
The Mayor of San Francisco ex
perienced the sensation last night o!
being hissed and hooted by a largo
crowd that gathered to hear a lecture
by the Rev. Father Shahan on Robert
Emmet and to do the lecturer honor.
So great was the disorder in the hnll
where the lecture took place that thts
remarks of Mayor Phelan, who was to
preside, were inaudible, save to those
on the stage and the people directly
in front of him.

Immediately after, the 6hobting Captain

rived on . the scene. . They . found Bogan
standing over his fallen comrade, revolver
in hand, and threatening to kill the first
man who molested 'him. -..Â¦.'
"They won't get. me, captain," he re
marked. "We gave them a good battle,

Crowd Jeers Wounded Man.
As J; Byrne, one of the victims, lay
wounded on Geary street, a' large crowd
of strikers and their sympathizers gath
ered around him and laughed at his suf
ferings.
"It serves him right." remarked one of
the gang.. "He will know better in the
future.". . ,
Police Officer Douglass, who overheard
the brutal: remark, promptly felled the
man who made it with his club.
Thinking that Boyne was dying Doug
lass summoned a hack and asked tho
driver to take the victim to the Receiving
Hospital.
"I can't do it," was the unmerciful
answer of the â¢ hackman, ; "you don't
want me to get beaten- to death."
As he 1 drove away another hackman
appeared and also refused to obeys the
command of the police officers" to take tho
wounded man to the hospital. Â¦ ' '.

asked still another hack driver to take

Â¦ and the disorders known as "weakness". are but symptoms of some damage to
B the reproductive! system, caused by a contracted disorder or early dlssipa-
B tlon. In looking for tho location of this damage- we generally find an en-
B larged, swollen and lnflammed prostate gland. As this gland Is the very cen-
B ter of the reproductive system. It can readily be understood that lnflamma-
B tlon of It must cause disordered function. These cases are promptly benefited
B by proper treatment, otherwise the patient goes from bad to worse. The es-
! sentlal point In all of them Is the necessity of the euro of the focus of the
*Â¦ trouble. In thÂ© prostate. Many men havo unsuccessfully treated for a weak-

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
The markets under this head remain about
the same. While the demand for the early
fruits has fallen off there is not much disposi
tion among holders to shade prices, as they are
confident of good markets during the balance of
the year. Prunes are slow In coming In, as
the tendency Is to hold them. The latest re
ports from Oregon say that the wet weather up
there is damaging the crop, as the Prunes urc
showing cracks and brown rot. Should the
wet weather continue serious Injury to the yield
Is probable.

Suppltes of Figs continue too large, and there
is a good deal of soft 'and partially decayed
stock which is selling below quotations.
The Panama steamer brought 281 boxes
Limes.
Watermelons sold off better, but there wab
still a eood deal of stock on the market, so
prices stood the same.
" There was a good shipping demand for
Grapes, but large supplies or carrled-over stock
prevented the market from advancing. Wine
Grapes, however, were still higher. They are
doing first rate this year. - Â¦
Peaches are steadier, but there is a good deal
of poor stock arriving in carriers, which keeps
the market down. The Bartlett Pears quoted
are generally cold storage stock, as the fresh
goods are about out. There is little change in
Plums. .1 .
Cape Cod Cranberries have advanced to $9 per
barrel, in sympathy with the Eastern market,
which is firm and advancing, owing to light
crops and the shortage in Apples. The first' car
reached here yesterday, and more fall due this
week.

NEW YORK. Sept. 2S.â The statement of the
associated banks for the week endintr to-day
shows:
Loans, $S67,609,700; Increase, $1,660,500.
Deposits. $336,4:-2,300; Increased, $6,090,400.
. Circulation, $30,070,500; decreased, $425,800.
Legal tenders, $71,469,700; Increased, $626,800.
Specie, $178,936,400; Increased, $3,534,600.
Reserves, $250,406,100; increased, $4,161,400.
Reserve required, $234,113,075; increased, $1,-
E22.200.
Surplus, $16,293,025: Increased, $2,638,500.
The Financier says: This statement, like
the preceding one, was doubtless made upon
rising averages for cash, the payments for
bonds in the closing days of the bank week
having been comparatively large. Moreover,
there was an arrival of $1,000,000 gold from
Europe after the close of the bank week.. The
$2,500,000 gold which arrived last week" frÂ«m
Australia was transferred, through assay office
checks, to this city during the current week,
as also in all probability will be the $1,600,000
gold which arrived at Port Townsend, Wash.,
from Cape Nome. This makes over $5,000,000 of
gold which, it is reasonable to suppose, will
be added to tbe cash of the banks this week,
besides the amount which may be paid for
bonds. The bank situation for the immediate
future, therefore, seems to be encouraging,
showing a continuance of easy monetary con
ditions. It should be observed, however, that
there is a concurrent drain of money into the
treasury on current fiscal operations and to
the Interior for crops, which may easily cause
more unfavorable conditions and these could
scarcely be avoided should bond offerings to 1
the treasury materially decrease In volume. So
far as the banj'.s can control the situation it is
fair to assume that they will strive to make as
favorable an exhibit in this and the succeed
ing week as po&Mble. in anticipation of the
October call of the Comptroller of the Cur
rency for a statement of their conditions. The
new Comptroller will doubtless make an early
demand for such a statement.

The disconcerting effect on speculative senti
ment of the developments In Amalgamated
Copper, doubtless was an important element
in deciding the change of policy on the part
of the. leaders. The conditions In the copper
trade, which are assigned as the cause of the
present demoralization in copper mining stocks,
axe; not new subjects in Wall street. Even the
omission of the customary extra dividend on
Amalgamated Copper stocks was Industriously
rumored fcr many days before the fact. It was
news to the speculators in the stock that for-,
elgn -consumption and exports of copper had
decreased enormously, owing to trade depres
sion and .failures, of electrical enterprises in
Germany. Copper trade statistics were In cir
culation In Wall street for weeks before the
collapse . in Amalgamated Copper and even
while its price was soaring to near its record
figure. Â¦ It was . only on the very eve of the
dividend action by the directors that the ma
nipulation for the advance and support of the
prices; -ceased. The rush to sell after the re
duction in the dividend found the market prac
tically bare of demand and the drop in the
price Trom 107^4 on Friday afternoon last week.
before the dividend was announced, to 8S% on
Wednesday was practically perpendicular. The
selling of stocks elsewhere in the market was
due : in large r part to speculative losses in
curred by the drop in Amalgamated Copper.
The whole speculative tone became pessimis
tic and there was large selling of long stock
and. short selling by the bears. The general
outlook was considered discouraging and views
were expressed that the cycle or prosperity had
reached the crest Rumors were rife of the
abandonment of some of the important finan
cial projets looking to extension of community
of interest and announcement was made that
measures for financing the. purchases of North
ern Pacific shares on behalf of Union Pacific
were to be postponed until more favorable con
ditions. This renewed the latent apprehension
of an outbreak of the quarrel over the control,
of Northern Pacific. Eastbound freight rates
into Chicago were reported demoralized on ac
count of the light grain movement, with a
threatened extension to trunk line territory,
and specific assertions were published of a feud
between Pennsylvania and Wabash over the
entrance of the latter Into Pittsburg. with
threats of reprisals. Fears recurred that the
interior demand for money would exceed the
reserves of New York banks and would neces
sitate .large curtailments of call loans to meet
them, while the sharp recovery In foreign ex-
Change carried rates well away from the gold-
Import point and destroyed hopes of immediate
relief from that source. Such were some of
the items making up the feeling of discour
agement In the stock market during the period
of violent decline in prices.
The future of the money market, indeed,
seems by no means clear, although interest
rates have declined and banks have shown in
creasing disposition to accommodate borrowers.
That heavy, requirements remain to be filled
for Interior currency needs' is certain.
There has been no notable selling pressure
in the bond market outside of a few specula
tive bonds.
