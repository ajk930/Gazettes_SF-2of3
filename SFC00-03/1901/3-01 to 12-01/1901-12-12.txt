KITCHENER
SAYS BOERS
ARE SAVAGE
Declares That Natives
Are Being Shot in -
Cold Blood.
Alleges Murders Are Commit
ted to Hide Movements
of Commandoes.
In Speaking of This Report War
Secretary Brodrick Says the Re
/ publican Forces Disregard
the Laws* cf "War.
LONDON. Dec. 11.â Lord Kitchener's
promised report specifying thirty-seven
instances in which natives have been shot
by Boers and which Involve the loss of
eighty-four lives,- was Issued by the War
Office to-night.
In some of the cases mentioned' the
blacks were shot after an informal court
martial or upon being accused of spying,
but in numerous instances which Lord
Kitchener indicated the natives were shot
in cold blood in order to â  hide traces of
the movements of Boer commandoes. The
period covered by Lord Kitchener's state
ment is over a year.
Speaking at Glasgow to-night Brodrick,
the Secretary of State for War, referred
toi Lord Kitchener's report upon the
shooting of. blacks by the. Boers. Brod
rick said that this report made it per
fectly clear that these murders were
committed in moments of passion, but
â were part of an organized system to cover
the tracks of the enemy and prevent pos
sible Information of their whereabouts.
Dealing with present aspects of the war
Brodrick said Boers had accepted parole
and broken it and that there would be no
repetition of such actions. Within recent
weeks Boer commanders had shown less
regard for the laws of war than previous
ly and these b4ndlts would before long
reach a crisis when they could no longer
be treated as belligerents.
No Half Measures.
The speaker said that the Government
was for no half measures for securing
a : settlement and that any. fresh negotia
tions must emanate from the 'Boers.
" Referring critically -'to^ the ' dissensions
In- the Liberal party Brodrick created
amusement by declaring that had Lord
â¢Rosebery been \ Premier the Liberals
would have had - a - right to - his ' counsel,
since the captain could not withdraw and
sulk in his cabin during rough weather,
especially if the first mate had turned
pirate and was engaged in looting the
cargo. - . --
Brodrick confirmed the Government's
decision, which . had already been, an
nounced, viz.: To break up .the unhealthy
concentration camps and remove the over
flow of concentrados to the coast, where
attempts would be made to provide them
with more permanent shelters.
"Now that General Ian Hamilton is
here," the Pretoria correspondent of the
Dally Telegraph cables, "Lord Kitchener
has personally taken the field and is di
recting the movements of the troops."
A correspondent of the Standard, tele
graphing from Brussels, says that he
hears that confidential negotiations are
imminent between Great Britain and Hol
land which are' not unlikely to result In
an arrangement for bringing Boer women
and children to Holland.
Boer Command Captured.
Lord Kitchener, In a dispatch from
Standerton, Transvaal Colony, dated

IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE
CONTROVERSY WITH ARGENTINE
State of Affairs Between the Two South American Republics Is
Decidedly Strained, and Both Appear to Be Preparing Their
Forces for the War Which Now Seems to Be Unavoidable
UENOS AYRES, Argentina, Dec.
11.â In' official circles there is a
growing conviction that Chile' is
seeking? a pretext to escape from
giving a definite reply to Argen
tina's proposals for a settlement of the
dispute in regard to" roads and pathways
opened In the. disputed territory. This be
lief is based upon the request by Chile for
a postponement of the next conference be
tween Senor Yanez, Chilean â Secretary of
Foreign Affairs, and the Argentine Min
ister to Chile, Senor Portela. until next
Friday/ . â¢ . . '
It is generally believed that the dispute
will not be settled on that day; that Ar
gentina will be forced to recall Minister
Portela; that the Government will send
troops to occupy the. roads and pathways
in the disputed territory, and tnat a state
ment will be made to King Edward of
Great Britain, arbitrator of the boundary
question.
The Government in acceding to the re
quest of Chile that the next conference
between .Secretary Yahez and Minister
Portela be delayed until Friday expressed
the hope" that a settlement of the dispute
would take place on that day. The seri
ousness of the situation is apparent from
statements made in the Tribuna, Presi
dent Rocca's organ. That newspaper re
flects the opinion in offlpial circles. It
Grave Condition Exists.
'; "The day has passed with several meet
ings of the officials of the administration.
There is strict secrecy observed regarding
the deliberations in these meetings, and
this leadsto the belief that a very grave
condition of affairs exists..
"The Minister of Foreign Affairs has
communicated to the President the report
of the, Governor of Santa Cruz, which
shows that the invaders of Argentine ter
ritory were two Chilean police agents..
"It Is said that the Government received
to-day another communication from the
Argentina Minister at Santiago. The con r
tents of i this communication are being
kept secret, but there are indications that
it contains alarming news, and that the
Government is obliged to adopt the firm
est measures.
"It looks as though the first measure
to be .taken will be the recall of the Ar
gentine Minister to Chile. !
"Are we on the verge of war? We hesi
tate to believe it, but it is. certainly true
that the Government of Chile is not firm
enough to decide the question in accord
ance with reason and dignity.
"This is very bad. ..The Argentine.Gov
ernment cannot adopt the Chilean policy
of withholding a decision. We will, there :
fore, be obliged to break off diplomatic
relations with Chile and to accept the
situation which, though not a war, -is not
very far from it."
War Preparations Made.
Another ( Buenos Ayres paper announces
that a private dispatch had been received
from a banking house In Santiago de Chile
to the: effect (that President Errazuriz
is disposed "to, obtain an early settlement
of the dispute in order to avoid a conflict,
but that the members of the Chilean Cab
inet are in a' different : mood. . The dis-f
patch adds that thÂ«,United States Minis
ter in Chile has' tendered "the" good offices
of his Government to prevent hostilities
between Argentina and Chile, n â 
. The â  newspaper in commenting upon
this dispatch says: . â¢ v
"We know that the United States Min

Plans.
Tillman Advises ? Harmony
and Will Work for.
Conciliation.
WASHINGTON, Dec n.â The Demo
cratic Senators to-day held their first cau
cus of the present session. Its purpose
was to consider committee assignments,
but the occasion was more than ordinarily
eignilicar.t because of the general attend*
ance upon the caucus. All the Senators
elected as Democrats with the exception
of Senator McLautin *>t South Carolina
were present, as were all the Senators
who were elected as Silver Republicans
or Populists. All the Independents except
Senator Teller of Colorado had entered
the Democratic' caucus held before ad
journment last March, but Senator Teller
then remained away. . He was present,
however, at to-day's conference and'Par
ticipated in the proceedings.
The caucus was called at the Instance
of Senator Jones of Arkansas, who stated
he thought it possible that the new Sen
ators might want to make some change
In the officers of the caucus. There was,
however, a general expression of satis
faction with the present officials, and Sen
ator Jones was re-elected unanimously
chairman of the caucus. The old commit
tee on order of business also was reap,
pointed, and the one vacancy on that
committee was filled by the selection of
Senator Dubois of Idaho, who was the
choice of all the Western members of the
caucus.
Tillman Urges Action.
During the proceedings Senator Tillman
suggested that there should be frequent
conferences and continued effort to agree
upon the main features of all political
controversies. There was a general re
sponse to this suggestion, and the opin
ion was fairly unanimous that the party
should present a united front, permitting
no more straggling than was absolutely
necessary.
Senator Jones presented a statement
from the Republican committee on .-com
mittees outlining its wishes as to the
committee assignments, from which it ap
peared that the Republicans were anxious
to increase the Republican membership
of several committees and to decrease the
Democratic membership of a few of the
committees. The most important change
suggested was that the Republicans
should be allowed to add one member to
their side of the Committee on -Com
merce, while the Democrats should agree
to surrender one of the places on that
committee held by them. The committee
as now constituted includes ten Republi
can members and seven Democratic mem
bers.
It was decided to vigorously resist this
Innovation. The Republicans also ex
pressed a desire to increase the member
ship of the Committees on Agriculture
and Census from nine to eleven each, the
two new members to be Republicans; to
increase the Committee on Claims from
thirteen to fourteen, the Republicans to
have eight members and the Democrats
six, as against seven and 6lx, respective
ly, as the committee is now constituted.
Democrats Oppose Changes.
An increase Is also proposed in the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations. As it at
present stands the committee numbers
eleven members, four of whom are Demo
crats. .The proposal Is to make it consist
of thirteen members, eight of whom shall
be Republicans and five Democrats. A
change was also suggested in the Com
mittee on Irrigation, which Is at present
composed of six Republicans and five
Democrats. The -change, if adopted
would give a membership of eleven, four
of whom would be Democrats. The Dem
ocrats decided to oppose the proposed
changes in the Committees on Claims and
Irrigation.
The Republican committee suggested no
changes in the committees on Appropria
tions. Finance and Judiciary, but indi
cated that they will continue Senator
Jones of Nevada on the Finance Commit
tee, thus practically adding one to the
Republican representation and taking one
from the opposition representation. The
Republicans did not Indicate any intention
to take care of Senator Wellington in the
matter of committees, nor was any sug
gestion made in the caucus that the Dem
ocrats should find places for him.

SENATORS TALK
OF THE TR EAT Y
Bacon and Cullom Take
Sides on the Canal
Question.
Arguments For and Against
the Measure Are
Advanced. '.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.â Two speeches
on the Hay-Pauncefote treaty were made
In the executive session of the Senate to
day, one by Senator Bacon in' opposition
to the treaty and the other by Senator
Cullom, the prospective chairman of the
Committee on Foreign 'Relations, in sup
port of it. i .
Bacon referred to the speech made yes
terday by Senator Lodge. He summed up
his objection in the statement that he
could not freely. accept any treaty which
does cot place the isthmian canal entire
ly under American auspices and American
control. This, he. said, the pending treaty
does not do, nor does it do anything li^e
It. It did not by long odds, he said, ac
complish what had been accomplished by
the Senate amendments made to the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty at the last session of
Congress.
The Davis amendment, he said, had ab
rogated all the objectionable provisions of
that treaty as negotiated, and it did not
matter what provisions there were in the
agreement so long: as the United States
was authorized, as it was by the princi
pal Davis amendment, to secure the safe
ty and maintenance of the. canal by its
own force. That amendment had given
this country a free hand to do what was
n*ceesary for the protection and defense
of the canal, whereas the present treaty
carried all the restrictions which were
originally contained in the old treaty,
leaving out the modifications of the Davis
amendment.
Suez Canal Restrictions.
He .also pointed out mat the treaty re
produces tne restrictions of the old Suez
canal treaty, which had been incorporated
in the original convention. He charged
that these restrictions had been copied
almost verbatim from the old treaty, the
only material change being in the omis
sion' of the words "in time of war as in
time of peace," from rule 1 of the Suez
canal agreement. This omission did. not.
in his opinion, change the character of
the agreement. ....
"The only reply," he said, "which the
advocates of the treaty make to the criti
cisms is that the canal would be under
the full Control of the United States in
time of war, but this is no more true uow
than under the old treaty, and it is a
strange thing, that all the. provisions reier
to the control of the canal in war, not
withstanding it is contended here that in
that contingency the .removal of this
phase places the canal under our absolute
control." * . â  ' ".
He said the war restrictions of the
treaty were entirely inconsistent with the
claims of. Senator Lodge that this coun
try should say who should use the canal
and who should not in case of hostilities.
He contended that the only power given
to the United States which was not given
to Great Britain was found in the last
sentence of regulation 2, providing that
"the -United States shall be at liberty to
maintain such military poMce along tr-e
canal as may be necessary to protect it
against lawlessness and disorder."
This, he said, was not sufficient to make
the canal. an American institution and if
the Davis amendment should be necessary
to render the . original treaty acceptable
it was equally necessary in this instance.
He considered the pending treaty as ob-"
jectionable as the treaty of last session.
The Argument of Cullom.
Senator Cullom congratulated the Sen
ate and the country upon the fact that
there are two things in connection with
the new treaty upon which, he said, prac
tically all are decided. One of these was
the desirability of the supercession of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and the other the
necessity for the construction of an isth
mian canal. He contended that the new
treaty radically changes the conditions
presented by the first Hay-Pauncefote
treaty, clearly relieving it of the necessity
of such an amendment as that made to
the old treaty upon the suggestion of Sen
ator Davis, because the treaty itself
would permit the United States, under
international law, to own, manage and
defend the canal in any way that it may
choose. In other words, he added, in a
war with Great Britain, or with any oth
er power, the treaty would be suspended
under thejlaw which governs nations un
til the war should be concluded, when it
would be revived and again enforced. He
dwelt upon the fact, w.hich he said was
the most important circumstance to be
considered, that the new treaty super
sedes and abrogates tile Clayton-Bulwer
convention of 1S50, and for this reason
would be of untold value to the country.
He admitted that the new treaty re
tains the general principle of neutraliza
tion, as did the original Hay-Pauncefote
treaty, but he urged that it does not re
enact, or keep alive any of the provisions
of the treaty of 1850. While it retains the
doctrine of neutralization, the provision
making the retention applies, the Senator
contended, to all nations alike, but to
none of them for any longer time than
they observe the regulations prescribed
by the United States. When they should
fall in this observance we should close
the canal under the terms of the treaty.
All nations would be placed on terms of
fairness and equality by allowing all to
use the canal in time of peace and shut
ting out all in time of war in case it
should be found desirable to do so. In
short. Senator Cullom urged, there is no
provision In the pending convention which
would interfere with our right as a nation
to close up the waterway to any belliger
ent power.
He contended that the provision in re
gard to the policing of the canal applies
only to its control in time of peace, and
not in time of war. The United States,
being the owne> of the property, under
the terms of the law could control It with
either the police or a military power, as
it might choose, for the protection of our
Government's property.
Referring to the fourth article of the
treaty, which was not contained in the old
treaty. Senator Cullora held that the pro
vision regarding the change of sovereign
ty would make no real difference in the
conditions, as the same rule would apply
if the sovereignty of the country trav
ersed by the canal should come to the
United States. Under, that improbable
condition the canal could be closed in
case of war, just as it could be in case
the sovereignty should . remain where it
now is, as the Senator predicted it would
remain.

ACTION WAS EXPECTED.
Becommendation of the Senators
Prom California Not a Surprise.
The announcement that Senators Bard
and Perkins have recommended to the
President the reappointment of Joseph S.
Spear Jr. for the office of Surveyor of
Customs here will not cause surprise or
regret in California. ThÂ« fact is known
to the California delegation in Congress
that President McKinley gave Spear per
sonal assurance that the latter should be
reappointed, or retained, as Surveyor for
another term.
It was the original purpose of Presi
dent McKinley to appoint Spear Collector
of the Port, but Senator Perkins advo
cated so persistently the appointment of
Colonel J. P. Jackson that the President
finally acquiesced when the Senator
stated that Spear could have his choice
of other Federal positions In this State.
Spear is well, known as an active Re
publican, but he has never contended that
a. Republican who refused to obey ma
chine orders should be outlawed. " He thas
administered the affairs of his office In a
commendable manner, nevor allowing his
Judgment or rulings to be swayed by po
litical considerations. It is highly proba
ble, however, that his . resignation as
chairman of the Fourth * Congressional
District Republican Committee will | soon
be tendered, as the President has ex
pressed a desire, or a determination, that
Federal officeholders shall not.be actively
concerned in the management of party
affairs. "

Speaking of-the packing Interests and,
as he said, the beef growers of the West
and the cotton raisers of the South,
Springer declared that there was but one
way in which the . measure could â¢ be de

â¢ Some ; surprise . was occasioned at the
failure of the minority of the committee
to aak ' for a division and vote *on the
question of reporting the bill. In the ab

corded. Jt was stated, however, . that a
minority report would be presented oy
the Democratic members r opposing the
bill on. general . grpunds, although it lÂ»
doubtful whether Representative Robert
flon. will sign the report.
Numerous conferences of Democratic
members were held prior to the meeting
of the Ways and Means Committee to-day
because of the question which. had arisen
as to united opposition to the Philippine
bill . drafted by Republican members. It
developed . that the four Louisiana mem
bers now In the cityâ Representatives
Robertson, Meyer, Davy and Ransdellâ
were favorable to the bill, and that the
.two. Louisiana members out of the cityâ
Broussard and Braezealeâ probably would
favor it. > ..- - â¢;..â â â - â¢ / .
The Louisiana members made no con
cealment of the fact that the. sugar In
dustry of their State required the meas
ure of protection against Philippine sugar
which the majority bill gave by, applying
the Dingley rates. Under these circum
stances the minority members reached no
decision as to opposing the bill.. and al
though there will be a minority report op
posing the measure on general i grounds
the Louisiana members will hold them
selves individually free to vote for the
bill.
Secretary Oage has written to Chairman
Payne pointing out that the bill should
provide for a rebate when articles export
ed from this country contain ingredients
imported from the Philippines on which
duty already has been paid. The bill prob
ably-will be amended to conform to this
suggestion.

TACOMA. Dec 11.â There are Beveral
Indications that George and William K.

fairs of the Metropolitan Bank, which
fa^ed three weeks ago yesterday. Chief
among these was the arrival here to-day
of Charles McXamee, business manager
for George Vanderbilt, who came direct
from Biltmore, N. C, at the personal re
quest of Mr. Vanderbilt to investigate the
situation and make a thorough report on
the condition of the bank's assets. These
are of less vaule than was supposed, it be
ing said by men who claim to know that
they are not sufficient to pay more than
from 10 to 20 cents on the dollar.
The bank had deposits of nearly $500,000.
yet on the evening before It failed the
Tacoma clearing-house refused to ad
vance more than a comparatively smaU
sum on the showing of assets privately
made. No statement of the assets has
been made public, and deep mystery ex
ists as to what became of, the money of
the depositors. It is claimed that officers
of the bank made large loans to them
selves and that some of the bank's at
taches speculated in mining, grain and
other stocks. .
The bank's most prominent officers are
Philip Caesar, president, and Jacob Van
derbilt, assistant cashier, who are neph
ews of George and William K. Vanderbilt.

Fugitive.
EL PASO. Tex., Dec. 11.â Acting upon
advices received from the Los Angeles
authorities of the possibility of Absconder
Fleishman passing through El Paso the
local police have made a careful- Investi
gation of all passengers from California
getting off at this point and believe that
they are In possession of facts throwing
light on the cashier's disappearance.
On Sunday morning a passenger giving
his name as N. T. Myers, got off the
Sunset Limited, which left California on
Saturday morning. At Silberberg Broth
ers' brokerage office he bought $840 worth
of Mexican money and a ticket from this
point to Guadalajara, Mexico. When
asked by one of the police officers to
describe Myers, R. Silberberg gave a de
scription which tallied almost exactly
with that sent to the Chief of Police here
by the Los Angeles authorities.
In his conversation with Mr. Silberberg
the stranger said he was going to the
west coast of Mexico. He seemed anx
ious to catch the Mexican Central south
bound passenger train, which left El
Paso at 10:10 a. m.
Police Beset "With Theories.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 11.â Police ener
gies have been directed in the channel of
following up every clew and theory which
might throw some light on the where
abouts of Henry J. Fleishman. As far
as definite results were obtained, the hunt
proved fruitless. The search has, how
ever, resulted in the elimination of sev
eral of the theories advanced and con
centrated police endeavors on two lines.
it?hese are:
V Firstâ That the fugitive left for Mexico
!jy way of the Sunset Limited on Satur
day morning.
Secondâ That he did not go by the Sun
pet Limited when he was seen at the Ar
cade depot last Saturday morning, teut
doubled back into Los Angeles, and either
is In hiding here, or has gone out of the
city by the northern route, leaving by the
Owl train of Saturday evening. â 
The theory that he went by the Sunset
Limited Is falling into disfavor. The au
thorities have the statements of the
trainmen that no man answering Fleish
man's description was on- the train. Add
ed to this the police have Information that
the fugitive was seen in Pasadena on
Saturday morning, and if this was the
ease he could not have been' on the train.
Then there is the statement of a real es
tate broker named McCord that 'he saw
Fleishman in Los Angeles on Saturday.
Saw Fleishman on Saturday.
TV. J. Variel, an attorney, says that a
man whom he has known casually for
many years told him to-day that he saw
Fleishman as late as Saturday afternoon
at the Arcade depot, just- prior to the de
parture of "the Owl. If* Mr. Variel's in
formant la certain of the day on which
he saw Fleishman, this would dispose of
the Mexican theory.
The Owl is well patronized by residents
of Los Angeles and San Francisco, in
both of which cities Fleishman is widely
known to the class of people who travtl
by that particular train. This has driven
the authorities back to the idea that
Fleishman is still in the city, and their
acceptance of this theory has led to a
vigorous search of the haunts in which he
was known.
There are many circumstances in the
case which show that Fleishman had no
evident Intention of getting out until Sat
urday morning, and then made his final
decision only after he had discovered on
Saturday that Amalgamated Copper had
dropped below the figure at which he
could carry the stock.
Hard Pressed for Iffoney.
There are many who believe, from the
fact that he offered the stock of the Los
Angeles Times as collateral for a loan no
later than Friday, that he was hard
pressed for money, in spite of the fact
that he had previously stolen large sums
from the bank. â¢
Charles Seyler Sr. has been elected
cashier of the Farmers' and Merchants'
Bank to succeed Fleishman. The appoint
ment came to Seyler as a surprise. He
will assume the duties of the position im
mediately. He has been summoned to ap
pear before the board to-morrow and to
go over some matters â with Mr. Hell man
relative to the bank's business. As soon
as he can do eo he will relinquish all con
nection with his present positionâ that of
local freight and ticket agent for the
Southern Pacific Railway Companyâ and
devote his entire attention to the duties of
his new place. Mr. Soyler has been a
resident of Los Angeles sixteen years.

MRS. ALLEN GIVES CLEW
DAMAGING TO HUSBAND
Santa Clara County's Sheriff Arrests Woman Suspected of
Knowledge of the Murder of Joseph Griffiths and Pris
* r oner Intimates That a Love Affair Led to the Tragedy
-Â«â  L_ " â  . A
SAN JOSE, Dec. 11.â Mrs. Margaret
Allen, who, with her husband,
Charles Allen, is suspected of
complicity in the murder of
Joseph Griffiths in Grass Valler.
was arrested in the Western Hotel at noon
to-day by Sheriff Langford. As was ex
pected the arrest of the woman bids fair
to speedily clear the mystery that cloaks
the killing of Griffiths. While she denied
knowledge of the tragedy her first state
ment supplied a clew that offers a motive
for the removal of Griffiths. Mrs. Allen
declared that she had left home because
her husband was enamored of Rosie
Hayes a woman who conducts a resort
near Grass Valley. Incidentally she de
clared that Griffiths was her husbands
rival for the affections of Rosie Hayes.
This rivalry may have led to the crime
which was uncovered several days ago
when the body of Griffiths was found at
the bottom or an abandoned mine shaft
at the rea r o f Charles Allen's dwelling.
Mrs. Allen is a plain looking ; womaa^of
about 32 years and very shabbily dressed.
She came to this city yesterday afternoon
from Oakland and registered as Mrs.
Smith. When arrested she was preparing
to take a position at housework in a Len
zen avenue residence. At first she demea
that she was Mrs. Allen, but. subsequent
ly admitted her identity.
Mrs. Allen denies all knowledge of the
murder of Griffiths, and says she knows
her husband is not guilty. Because of
the jealousy and cruel treatment of, her
husband- and' the attentions he. paid to
Rosie Hayes, she says; she ran away
from home about four weeks ago. That
night and the next day she walked to
Marysville. She remained there three
weeks. There she met Richard 'Bennetts.
She borrowed some money from him ; and
the two came to Oakland. - She then left
When told she was charged with hav
ing guilty knowledge of yie murder she
broke down and began crying.
"The last time I saw Griffiths," said Mrs.
Allen, "was a few days before he disap
peared. My husband and I were In the
garden pulling up some weeds when Grif
fiths came along. My husband spoke to
him and asked him where he was going.
Griffiths said he had been on a spree."
Mrs. Allen said she had left her husband
once before because of the attentions he
paid the Hayes woman. At one. time she
had been a friend of Rosie Hayes. Her
husband and Griffiths frequently met at
the woman's home, and she had been
warned that the men would have trouble.
Mrs. Allen's sister, Mrs. KItto, had told
her that the two would fight and she
would "lose her husband."
Mrs. Allen declares her belief that the
Indians killed Griffiths, because of the
breaking up of the home of Toley Durgie,
their chief, by Griffiths. After Griffiths'
disappearance Mrs. Allen says she had
heard that Griffiths; with two Indiana,
had been seen together near Grass Valley.
Allen's Boys Make Confession.
Sheriff Getchell of Nevada County, who
arrived here this evening to take Mrs.
Allen back to Grass Valley, â  has = given
the first intimation regarding the evidence
in his possession. He says the mystery
has been in the employ of the railway
company for more than thirty years.
Fleishman's Female Companion.
BAKERSFIBLD, Dec. 11.â The identity
of the handsome woman In black who
was in company with H. J. Fleishman,
the defaulting cashier of the Farmers'
and Merchants' Bank of Los Angeles,
during his visit to this city on November
8 last has been established. She proves
to' be â¢ Mrs. Marie V. Cunningham, a
"beauty doctor" of Los Angeles â the
woman whom the Los Angeles authori
ties have questioned as to her knowledge
of the whereabouts of the missing man.
The couple kept close company during
thier stay in this city and Mrs. Cunning
ham was â¢ Introduced to some of Fleish
man's friends.
Those in Bakersfield who were well ac
quainted with Fleishman and who were
slow to believe that he was guilty of a
defalcation have now arrived at the con
clusion that the situation Is as bad as it
has been painted. The visit of* Fleishman
and his female companion to this city is
now freely discussed. However, the idea
Is not entertained that Mrs./ Cunningham
was in any way responsible 'for the cash
ier's criminal act. Instead, it is said she
would have advised against any such pro
cedure, and, besides, it is said she had
no claim on. Fleishman further than that
of one friend upon another.
Downfall Not Due to Women.
A merchant of this city, who was reared
with Fleishman . and â  is In a position to
know something concerning his tempera
ment, says that in his opinion no woman
had anything to do with the crime com
mitted by the cashier.
"Wall street led him to the act," he
said. "Wall-street speculation alone is re
sponsible for his undoing. Fleishman was
a man who was fond of woman's com
pany, but he was not a man who would
allow himself to become entangled in an
affair with a woman which would eause
him to steal the amount of money he Is
accused of taking. . t
"The fact that Mrs. Cunningham was In
company '.with Fleishman in this city at
the time â¢ he was , called here as a wit
ness In the Forsythe forgery case has no
significance, so far as the theft , is ..con
cerned. Mrs. Cunningham had no power
over him which would place him in any
financial difficulty. . His trouble was
brought about through his speculations."
At the .. close of the Forsythe case, on
the afternoon when Fleishman was here,
he and Mrs. Cunningham and a gentle
man of this city were seen driving. \When
Fleishman departed for Los Angeles the
woman also left, saying that she was go
ing to San - Francisco. , < - ...

will be punished. Two sons of Charles
Allen, aged 12 and 14 years, : have given
evidence, it < is said, that may convict
their father and the Indian, Tolie Durgie,
of the crime. ;
Sheriff Getchell has been. busy hunting
the suspects since -the' finding' of, the body
of Griffiths, and the Grand Jury has been
busy gathering evidence. This shows, so
the Sheriff claims, that Charles Allen and !
the Indian killed Griffiths and that Mrs. 1
Allen was 'a witness of the murder.
On the day of tbe disappearance of
Griffiths, April 15 last, the latter called
at the home of the Aliens in the after
noon, but left after a short stay. He re
turned, however, between 4 and 5 o'clock
in the evening with a jug of whisky. 'â  Just
what occurred is not known, but a night
of revelry was passed by Allen, Griffiths,
the Indian, who had come in later, and
Mrs. Allen. It is supposed the party be
came intoxicated and a fight ensued^
probably because of the jealousy of Al
len. In the combat Griffiths was killed,
and Allen and the Indian carried the
body to the old shaft, which i3 about forty
feet back of the Allen house. This is the
theory Sheriff Getchell evolves from the
evidence in his possession.
Bennetts' Share in Case.
The two Allen boys have been before
the Grand Jury and they have broken
down, told the story of the night's de
bauch, and given evidence against Allen,.
Durgie and their mother. They have been
ordered into the custody of the court, to
be held as witnesses. â¢
Sheriff Getchell says Mrs. Allen is a
crafty woman. He declares that she left
Grass Valley and went to Marysville with
Bennetts in a wagon and then to Oak
land, and that Bennetts intended to join
her here. The Sheriff will take both back
to Grass Valley to-morrow.

cently when the young woman went to
Napavine, ten miles away, to become a
companion in the family of a married
friend.. She set -Thanksgiving for their
wedding day, and Aust made elaborate
preparations for the event. He procured
a marriage license showing him to be 22
and the girl 19 years old. The girl's step
father accompanied him, and they had
the written consent of" her mother.
When Aust drove to Napavine for his
bride she suddenly balked and declined
to accompany him back to Chehalis to
be married. The next day friends of both
went down to Napavine. and Olene con
sented to have the ceremony performed.
Aust then drove to Napavine for a sec
.ond time and she returned with him. ' â 
S Arriving at Chehalis the girl again de
clined to be married. The next day she
changed her mind and the couple were
married by Rev. Mr. Monfort of the
Presbyterian church. She answered the
marriage questions clearly and 'firmly
On the day following Mrs. Aust declared
that she preferred living in Napavine and

REDDING, Dec. 11.â The hard "bear

with the retirement In this countv of
General Manager . H. A. Keller and the
officials of his staff on the Trinity Copper
Company, a Boston corporation at the
head of ; which is Lawson, and which is
installing an immense copper mining and
smelting plant in â â > this county. Perhaps
the state i of Amalgamated Copper had
nothing to do with the sweeping changes
of the Trinity Company officials, but cer
tain it is that - the announcement to-dav

Name of the Craft Appears on Flot

Beach After the Be
'â }':. cent Storm.
SEATTLE, Dec> 11.â It is reported from
Neah Bay that' wreckage with the name
"Matteawan"'on pieces of it has washed
ashore, fourteen, .miles south of Cape
Flattery. . The find was made about a
week ago' by, natives. ;. .
News from the north that wreckage
from the collier Matteawan has been
picked up near I Cape Flattery confirms
the fear that the .vessel has gone down
with all on board* Jhe big steamship left
Nanaimo ten days ago, and was not
spoken thereafter. * Since / that time there
have: been terrific gales along- the north
eyi coast, and, as â  the Matteawan ..was
heavily laden, her absence ' soon aroused
the keenest anxiety in shipping circles.
This fear kept constantly increasing, and
that little hope of the vessel's safety was
entertained- was shown- by the rates of
fered for reinsurance. - v
On Tuesday there were no quotations.
Yesterday morning . 20 per cent was of
fered. Later in the day the rate went
up' in bounds until, at. tfie close of busi
ness hours, 35 per cent -was the prevailing
rate, with few willing to . run the ; risk
evenÂ» at that tempting figure. ' ; .â 
James; Jerome, the agent, was frequent
ly â¢' asked ; yesterday by relatives of such
members Â« of the â¢ crew as -reside here for
information about the vessel, but he
hsÂ£T not received any advices. The Mat
teawan carried a crew of thirty-one men,
but as the captain signed ithe majority
Jerome .has no record * of â¢ their names.
H3 said: ":--. . ':
All I know about the crew is that Captain
Crosscup, who resides in Oakland, is in com
mand. The first officer's name is Hastings,
and he comes from Tacoma; Wilson Is the sec
ond officer and, I. think, Is a resident of this
city; the chief engineer Is also named Wilson,
and I think he resides In Oakland. I have
given special Instructions to the captains ot our
four ahlps that are now at sea to keep a care
ful watch for the Matteawan. The Progreso
and the Washtenaw are northward bound, and
the South Portland and the Edith are coming
this way. Besides all other steam vessels will
keep a lookout for ; the 'delayed V vessel. The
weather has been bad off the Oregon coast, and
it is probable that her machinery has broken
down. We do not fear for her ultimate safety.
The Matteawan v was a steel screw
steamer of 3301 tons net, and was built
in 1893 at Newcastle, England, by J.
Readhead & Sons. She was formerly
called the Asturian Prince. The Mattea
wan was 336 feet long, 42 feet in beam and
18 feet 3 inches deep.- Her cargo consist
ed of 4S00 tons of coal.

ENDS HIS LIFE
IN CATHEDRAL
Resident' of Truckee
Kills Himself in
Sacramento.
Albert Bel aine Selects House
of Worship as Scene of \
His Suicide.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. U.â The great
Catholic Cathedral tower had scarcely
ceased reverberating the. Angelus this
morning when in the north portico of the
building a man was found lying In a pool
of blood, with a bullet hole through his
head and a tightly clenched revolver in
his hand. He was breathing faintly and
a few hours after his removal to the Re
ceiving Hospital he died without having
returned to consciousness. Documents on
his person indicated that his name was
Albert Belaire and his home Truckee. In
one of his pockets were found a number
of leaflets explanatory of the teachings
of the Church of the Latter Day Saints.
Belaire was about 45 years of age and
of fine physique. He was a Knight of
Pythias and the local lodges have taken
charge of his body. - ..
â  A singular feature of the case Is that
the revolver, when released from his
grasp, showed that one cartridge had been
discharged and that the hammer had then
passed three cartridges without making
an indenture upon any cf them. It has
been learned also that nobody heard a
pistol shot near the cathedral this morn
ing, while one was heard there about 11
o'clock last night. It is thought to be
probable that Belaire entered the rotunda
at that hour and shot himself and that
his almost lifeless body lay there undis
covered until this morning.
TRUCKEE, Dec. 11.â Albert Belaire,
who committed suicide in Sacramento, has
lived in Truckee for twenty years, and
during most of that period has been head
sawyer at Schaffer'a sawmill. He had
always borne an excellent reputation and
was a member in good standing of Sum
mit Lodge No. 54. Knights of Pythias.
Both anchors were out and held firmly.
She had one sail . set. There was not a
living soul aboard. Two boats were gone,
having been used by the crew In leaving
the ship: Her load of ballast was shifted
until she lay nearly on her beam ends.
The Tyee did not stop here with her.
but the tug Pioneer called in to wire to
the Puget Sound Towboat Company for
instructions as to where to take her, and
she was towed on up the Sound. â¢
The Pinxnore is the bark that was aban
doned by her crew oft Grays Harbor,
seven seamen perishing through the cap
sizing of a small boat in which they at
tempted to reach shore.
ABERDEEN, Wash., Dec. 11.â The of
ficers and surviving members of the crew i
of the bark Pinmore, which went ashore
north of here on Wednesday, left for
Portland to-day. The men lost everything
they had except the clothes they wore,
and suffered greatly from exposure and
want of food.
The schooner Maid of Orleans, from this
port -to San Francisco, lost her deckload
of lumber in the recent storm, and several
of her crew narrowly escaped being
washed overboard.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 11.â The schooner W.
S. Phelps, understood to be on her way
to the Galapagos Islands on a trip of ex
ploration, came in this afternoon from sea
in distress, having sprung a leak, which
the crew was not able to locate and stop
from the inside of the hull. She dropped
anchor some distance down the bay, but
will come up. to be beached near the San
ta Fe wharf to-morrow. " ' ; .
Raining in San Diego.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 11.â Rain began fall
ing at 10:30 o'clock to-night. The pros
pects are for an. all-night storm. I

CAPTAIN TRIBBLE OF SAUSALJTO
MAKES DAMAGING ADMISSIONS
United States Inspectors Bring Out: tha; Fact During Investigation
That the Rules Governing Pilots Were Disregarded in Running
of the Ferryboat on Night of Collision With the San Rafael
INSPECTOR BULGER put Captain
Tribble of the Sausalito through an
inquisition yesterday afternoon and
forced an admission that the ferry
boat master did not know the rules
for pilots in regard to passing signals.
Now, the pilot books say that in the fog,
where one boat cannot seo another, no
passing signals shall be given. Captain
McKenzie gave the "helm to starboard"
â whistle at first, and was answered by the
same whistle from the SausaJito. It was
after this that the signals to back wore
given.
The books al^o say that a moderate
ypeed is all that tan be used under the
conditions existing, yet the Sausalito ran
nt three-quarters gauge to the Jslan-i.
Then the slow bitll was given th-i engineer.
Tribble said he thought his methods were
the best, despite the prescribed pilot rules
and regulations. He evrn admitted to ig
norance of certain sections of the rules.
The proceedings yesterday were devoted
to a second examination of Captains Mc-
Kenzie and Tribble. Again fog whistles,
ebjnals and bells formed the main subject
of the questioning, but this time some
damaging admissions were made.
Disobeyed the Law.
Here is the section taken from Pilot
Rules for Atlantic and Pacific Coast In

vessel hearing, apparently forward of her
team, the fog rlgnal of a vessel the position
cf which is not ascertained shall, so far as the
circumstances of the cave admit, ctop her en
tlr.rs. and then navigate with caution until
danger or collision is over.

I gard of the injunctions. The admissions
were dragged out of Captain Tribble.
"Captain, Bow many people to your
knowledge were lost?" asked Inspector
Bulger of Captain McKenzie.
â¢ The reply was:, "Two â Crandall and a
little "boy. ir the mother had not been
j panic-stricken -*he boy would not have
drowned. She rushed toward the boy,
seized him and jumped overboard with
him. The little girl with her was saved."
Captain McKenzie admitted the death
; of Treadway, but said, the life was
I crushed out .of him. From what he was
told he thought that was the entire list
. of deaths.
"If the San Rafael had had bulkheads
j !n her do you think she would . have
sunk?" asked Bolles.
"No, 1 don't think she would," was the
answer. .........
The captain further said that. the-' boat
did not break up and that the machinery
] was too heavy for the hull, j '"'. â  ' "

the wheel of testimony.
"Going under a slow bell and heading

"Somewhere between Powell and. Lom

PROPOSED BASEBALL CHANGES
WILL NOT BE MADE AT PRESENT
National League Is . Claimed to Be in the Same
Place It Was Teti^ Years; Ago. V.
XEW YORK, Dee. 11.â John T. Brush's,
scheme for a revolution' of baseball . Is '
dead. At the meeting at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel to-day the National League, mag
nates decided by a majority vote "that the
league was a perpetual body and did not
cease with the expiration of the Indian
apolis agreement on December 18. It was
decided also that no club can be, expelled
from the league except for specified
causes, as set forth in the constitution
and by-laws of the organization. Thus
Brush's plan for syndicate baseball came
to an end. The vote, it Is said, * means
that the National League is back where
it was before the signing of the Indian
apolis agreement in 1891.
An attempt was made at to-day's meet
ing to elect A. G. Spalding president. It
was first reported he had been beaten,
but this proved untrue. Shortly after the
magnates went into session Dreyius made
Danny Maher, the Jockey, B^etums.
NEW YORK, Dec. 1Lâ Danny Maher,
the American jockey, who will â¢ ride the
race horses owned by King Edward VII
of England, arrived in this city on the
steamship Kaiser Wilhelrn der Grosse." In
an interview he says; - >
"I am over here on a trip for the holi
days. I will remain in America unUl Feb
ruary and then return to England to gal
lop the horses for Richard Marsh and
several other owners. In my opinion the
best two-year colt last season was Ard
Patrick, owned by John. Gubblns.' The
best 'fills', I think. Is Sterling Balm."

intended course of Captain McKenzie.
'.'At the time you got the two whistles,
if you had got three would it have made
any difference?" asked Bolles.
"I would have backed her at once," said
Tribble.
With the conclusion of Captain Tribble's
testimony the investigation closed. The
inspectors will weigh the evidence and
then return judgment. >
BULKHEADS FOR FERRYBOATS.
Improvement Will Reduce Banger of
Loss of Life to Minimum.
In view of the recent loss of life caused
by the sinking of the ferry steamer San
Rafael, Captain John Bermlngham,' super
vising inspector of steam vessels, has sug
gested to the superintendent of the South
. ern Pacific ferry system the propriety of
bulkheaUlng the steamers of that system,
and the assurance has been given that
the suggestion will be carried out. A
similar suggestion .was made as to the
ferry steamers on other lines on the bay
and similar assurances have been given.
At : the' present session of Congress a"
bill will bÂ« Introduced* making it obliga
tory for bay and river steamers to be
properly bulkheaded.
â¢ The recent ferry-boat accident was the
first that has happened in. San Francisco
Bay in, thirty-live years. 'The steamboat
Clinton' wag then sunk in a collision near
Alcatraz and her engineer killed. - In 1857
the Contra Costa blew up while enter
ing Oakland Creek. These are the only
accidents of, any note that have befallen
local ferry-boats. . â 
a motion that! the ielection Vot officers be
proceeded with, Tliis was amended that
A. Q. Scalding: be unanimously elected
president. The hitch was, in doing away
with the- regular order, of? business so as
to proceed with the election.- In the reg
ular .order the reports of .the board of di
rectors and- thoee of various committees
must be heard before the. election can be
proceeded : with..- When the matter was
put to a vote Boston,- Cincinnati, St.
Louis and New. York voted' for proceeding
hi the regular order, thereby setting. back
Spaidlng's .election until later. , It is said
upon good- authority that at least five of
the clubs favor the election of j Spalding.
They are Pittsburg, "Boston, Chicago,
Brooklyn and Philadelphia.
At 8:30 o'clock to-night the league rulers
began another session, at Which they lis
tened to the report . of the board of.di
rectors. The meeting adjourned I about

WATERCURE TAKES A HANDICAP
FROM A CLUSTER OF FAST ONES
Meehanus Is Heavily Piayed to Win the Event but Runs Beyond
the Money-Jarretierre d'Or Defeats Some Clever Two-Year-
Olds-Howell First at the Wire on Tizona, a 20 to I Shot
IT was a good Joke the shrewd set
framed up on themselves at Oakland
â yesterday. Everybody suspected of
â  possessing an atom of horse sense
â laid his checks down on Meehanus
with' his 119 pounds to win the six and a
half " furlong free handicap, simply be
cause it was too far for Watercureâ on
paper. Meehanus, backed down to 6 to
5, apparently sulked with Woods, running
next to last. The price about "Watercure,
carrying 122 pounds and Winnie O'Connor,
floated to 3 to 1, and in a drive he caught
and, beat; out Doublet a length in 1:21%.
There was no part of it that Green Mor
ris' crack horse did not look a w'nner.
O'Connor took matters very coolly back
in the rear to. the stretch, and then cut
loose. For a time he did not have clear
sailing. This made -it closer down at the
wire than it otherwise would have been.
Three Favorites in a Kow.
Splendid weather and the prospect of
seeing the racing decided over a fast
track once more attracted an excellent
crowd. Three straight favorites came
through, after which there was a decided
slump in the market. " Tizona, a 20 to 1
shot, was the star long shot performer.
"Frisco" Lind's big gelding Afghan cap
tured the opening sprint from a bunch of
ordinary ones. Mounce sat in the pilot
house and ran into the slip three-posts of
a Jength in advance of B. F. Mason, a 10
to 1 chance. Mrs. Brunell, the second
choice, never seemed threatened , with
much speed.
Jarretierre d'Or, the speedy gelding
from Jack Atkins' string, turned up an
easy winner of the two-year-old sprint at
five furlongs. Once 3% in the betting, he
closed an 11 to 3 favorite. Nicely handled
by Buchanan, he ran in two lengths
ahead of Esterwell, the Schorr .entry.
Cathello, at 60 to 1, beat Louwelsea for
the show.
Native Fortunate to Win.
On his showing in" the seven furlong
run, it looked /as if Goldone was short a
trine. Native came in for a play that
lasted until "last call" in the liner and
was fortunate to win. He caught Gusto
after some hustling, but at the end had
nothing left and only downed Goldone a
neck. Apparently the latter horse could
not be kept up the first part by Woods,
or there would have been nothing to it.
Dunblane finished in the show.
Bullman landed the mile and a furlong
selling number with Plohn, against which
horse 5 and 6 to 1 was laid. After collar
ing Merops, Plohn took the lead and was
hard pressed to down Sunello less than a
length. Woods put up a sloppy ride on
the last named horse or he would have
been returned first. The race was a bad
one from every standpoint. -
In the speculating on the concluding
five and a half furlong dash Midnight
Chimes and Parsifal ruled about equal
choices. Tizona, an outsider, laid second
to the stretch and then finishing strong
led the unlucky Midnight Chimes over
the line a length.
Track Notes.
Fifteen books cut in. Frank Bain with
drew after dissolving partnership and will
return to New York, it is said.
" When Willie Buchanan crosses the At
lantic again in February "Red" Comer
ford will accompany, him.
George Rose has secured the field book
privileges from the New California
Jockey Club and will assume control on
Saturday. As has been published, when
it was announced that the admission fee
to the track would be $1 50, Driscoll and
Rainey. the first â - successful bidders,
threw up the privilege. It was then re
opened for fresh bids. In speaking of his
Eastern trip George Rose said he had
experienced a very successful season,
handling an average of $50,000 a day.
This places all of the big layers of odds
in the shade.
Frank Eckert made his first appear
ance on the block yesterday. Frank is a
very fast handler of coin and seldom
"ducks" any wagers.
"Silver Bill" Reilly, the veteran pen
ciler and auctioneer, was another new
lace seen upon the block. Mr. â¢ Reilly
drew the stand next to Frank Eckert.
"Fletch" . Jones . will probably leave
New Orleans and come here to ride.
Howell. who rode here last season for
the Shulte stable, landed his first win
ning mount this trip in Tizona. He is a
clever rider and will get plenty of mounts.

KID LAVIGNE IS KEADY ; ..
FOE THE AUSTBALIAtt
Clever Lightweight Boxers Will
, Meet To-Night in Oakland Be
fore the Acme Club.
Tim Heagerty, the clever Australian
boxer, will have his tirst opportunity to
night - in America to make good ;his
Australian record.. That he will do so* his
friends seem to have no doubt. He enters
the ring heavier than he has ever been
before after having undergone a most
careful preparation. ,
Lavlgne's friends are also confident of
the outcome, as the Saginaw man has
Improved steadily since he commenced
training. A fast fight Is looked for from
the tap of the gong. The spectators who
saw Lavigne's flght with "Walcott know
what this means.
: The men are both at weight. They will
go through the formality of weighing Â«r.,
however, this afternoon at 3 o'clock at
Harry Corbett's.
There has been no betting on the fight
Some of Heagerty's friends have tried to
get on small bets, but found no takers.
The public has no line on Lavigne's pres
ent form as compared with his champion
ship form, and only a hazy Idea of
Heagerty's ability. This accounts for the
absence of wagering.
The first brace of boxers will enter the
ring at 8:30. Boats leave here at 7:30 and
8:05. The Exposition building, in which
the bouts will be held, will hold 5000 spec
tators.
There will be two six-round prelimin
aries. Henry Martin and Jack 1 Rlttler
will box at 122 pounds and Jim Brown and
Jack Murphy at 150 pounds.

TOUR OF INVESTIGATION ENDS
IN A HARROWING SHIPWRECK

as he grabbed a piece of fish line
and endeavored to make fast to
a teredo eaten pile under Main
street wharf.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1901.
"Don't jump overboard, Rudolph, -with
all those things about you." shouted Per
cy Henderson, as he -restrained Commis
sioner Herold jj from a rash attempt to
swim ashore.
"I wish I had my buckboard here," sad
ly mused ex-Governor Budd, "for then I
could get off and walk when I wanted
to."
"Send for Harry Ryan," ventured Chief.
Engineer Norton, "he could get us out ot
this predicament."
And every minute the smokestack of
â the gasoline launch, from which this dis
tinguished party were anxiously seeking
to escape, gave a little chuch-chuch, the
wheel went round, but nary a budge was
there. The launch was fast to a sub
merged pile under Main street wharf, and
time was flitting rapidly by. \
It was an awful time for the investigat
ing Commissioners. They started out
gayly enough In a launch to view the
docks, and there they were stranded un
der a wharf.. That broken pile held the
launch as in a vice. There was water all
around them, and the heavy planks above
them. . No spund could be heard from be
neath, although Budd tried the stentorian
tones of his voice in all thÂ« varied pitches
he had used on the banks of the Mokel
umne, Cosumnes anfi Stockton slough.
"My lunch is getting cold," moaned
Kilburn.
"Oh, drat your lunch," responded Her
old, "I want a drink."
"â Let somebody Jump overboard and
swim ashore," said Chief Engineer Nor
ton.
Henderson pulled a nail out of his
pocket, got a piece of twine somewhere
and dropped it over the side. Bottom was
struck at about four feet.
"Four fathoms deep. I dare not at
tempt to swim," responded Henderson.
DUNPHY MURDER
TRIAL BEGINS
Policemen Testify Con
cerning Statements
A jury was secured in Judge Cook's
court yesterday to try James M. Dunphy,
who is charged with the murder of Ed
ward Stanton October 27 last at the cor
ner of r Minna and- Mary streets. The
talesmen who satisfactorily answered all
questions and were sworn to try the case
are J. M. Merrill, J. E. Dealey, J. W.
Tamm, Jamel Walsh, I. Frahm, ' J. H.
Dooley,. George Lake, W. H. Tllson, W.
E. Lovejoy, Si. Stockwitz, Andrew Jack
son and. Philip Hirleman. The defendant
is represented by Attorney J. J. Barrett
of this city and Attorney John T. Ryan of
Vallejo. ' Assistant . District Attorneys
Weller and. Alford are conducting- â  the
prosecution.'
It was apparent from the cross-exam
ination of the witnesses by Attorney Bar
rett that self-defense will be pleaded and
justification urged from the alleged fact
that Stanton : deceived Dunphy' s sister
and talked about It in Vallejo.
Policeman R. ,N. Silver testified to ar
resting Dunphy. a few minutes after the
commission of the crime. He said that
Dunphy -stated he had spoken to Stanton,
who said he would blow the roof of -his
head off,' and made a motion with his
band toward his hip pocket. Then Dun
phy shot him, as he, did.not want to take
any chances. Dunphy said that Stanton
had deceived his sister and he had been
searching for him â¢ for two weeks. The
Friday night before the murder Dunphy
said he was unarmed and met Stanton
with four or five friends, and they
"jumped" him. It- was after . that , he
bought the two revolvers which he used
in, killing Stanton. After.' the shooting
Dunphy asked to be protected, as he was
afraid of Stanton's â¢ brother. 'â  .'â  v â  - â 
â  â . Policemen Robert Conner and- David
"The water is awful cold," said Kil
buTn, as he â withdrew a finger ' he had
stuck in the briny deep, as he lay prone
on his stomach. The shock and the ex
citement keeled him over, and he was
tenderly laid on the cabin floor, suffering
from nervous prostration.
"Oh, this is awful," -all exclaimed in
chorus. "We'll never get off.- Let us all
yell."
One mighty shout and then another
went up from the stranded Investigators.
It echoed under the wharf, ricocheted on
the swell caused by a' passing steamer,
and was flnally'lost on the windward side
of Goat Island.
The frantic efforts of the party to ex
tricate themselves from a predicament
Into which their tour of investigation had
led them were unavailing. For over two
hours their launch hung on that sub
merged pile, and they were about resign
ing themselves to the apparent fate of
being shipwrecked In sight of land, when
at last help came. A "Whitehall boat
passed about a hundred yards away.
Handkerchiefs, coats and hats were
waved in the air, the whistle was tooted,
and at last the Whitehall waa turned in
the direction of the launch. Wild with
Joy at the prospect of relief they .lumped
on deck and hugged each other. The boat
drew near.
"You first, Herold," said Budd, gal
lantly.
"After you, Governor," said Herold, not
to be excelled In politeness.
"Go I ahead. Chief," and Henderson and
Norton prepared to get on.
"Kllburn first." said the others, and he
was tenderly handed. over the side, laid
on the seats, and rowed ashore. One by
one the others got off. Kilburn was sent
'home in a carriage and all the others
swore one another to secrecy. The launch
floated at high tide, none the worse for
wear. I
BOARD SUSPENDS

The Board of Education yesterday sus
pended William Zimmerman from his po
sition of teacher of German in the Poly
technic High School. , The. suspension is

Zimmerman's change of base in request

is contempt of court, Inasmuch as Judge
Dunne's, writ restrained the board from
removing or suspending Zimmerman un
til it had been decided.

FACTIONAL WAR
IN LABOR PARTY
Bold Scheme to Displace
| J. S. Parry From
Leadership.
Fight. Places Mayor -Elect
Schmitz in Awkward
Predicament.
There is war In the camp of the Union
Labor party. One faction* is clangoring?
for the overthrow of J. S. Parry, chair
man of the executive committee of j tl:e
new party. Night before last under the
guise of proceeding to reorganize the com
mittee, a bold dash was made to supplant
Parry of the Piledrivers' Union by the
election of William Dâ¬laney of the'
Machinists' Union. The supporters ot
Delaney In the committee assert that the
raid was successful and that Delaney "is
it." On the other hand- the j Parryltes
maintain tha| the proceeding was void
and .that their man Parry is still the
chairman of* the committee. â  Indications
point to prolonged and bitter strife.
George F. Aubertlne of the Barbers'
Union i Is in the same boat with Parry.
The committee voted to make J. Dowling
of the Hackmen's .Union secretary:- The
faction which claims that the'reorganiza
tion'was regular and valid. elected as vice
chairman Timothy Ryan of the Brother
hood of Teamsters, and as treasurer John
McKeon of- the Riggers', and Stevedores'
Union. â¢ ' , â  '
Parry Close to Schmitz.
The : executive committee consists of
twenty-five members. J. S... Parry, ,whÂ»
was chairman of. the body" during the Iat8
municipal. campaign. and who insists that
he holds the championship riow,- is com
monly supposed to be next.to Mayor-elect
Schmitz. It isÂ»a well known .fact' that
Schmitz in the- fight* was never, out of
Parry's sight unless he was in hailing: dis
tance; of Ruef. i All ' three were acttve
members of . the Republican Primary.
League, and ln'the roomsof the league.
Ruef and Parry adjusted" the wires, > for
Schmitz's nomination by the Labor party.
In fact Schmitz 1 was waited on by a com
mittee and; agreed .to accept the nomin-
ation before. the convention was' called
into existence. Ruef's scheme' to obtain
for Schmitz the indorsement, of the Re
publican Municipal â  Convention*-was-~not :
carried. out, but. the plan to elect Schmitz
without such; Indorsement "was readily
adopted by .Ruef and Parry, and proved
successful. â. A ' .' .' .' ' ...
By the turning, down of Parry several
labor- leaders of Democratic tendencies
who have not had an opportunity -to get
next to Schmitz hope to approach the pie
counter of the next administration and
help themselves, and 'their - friends â â¢ to
choice slices. I It is common . rumor that
several executive â¢ committeemen have
made. promises of patronage, -and it now
remains to be seen whether they 'can
make good. â¢ â  - -â¢ .;â¢;;-â¢.â¢.;;
Embarrassing for Mayor-Elect.
Mayor-elect Schmitz . Is likely to be
placed in a very embarrassing position
between the two factions. . He may decide
to recognize both in the award of patron
age to party workers, but he^will doubt
less first employ, all the tact and diplo
macy that he possesses ta bring abrut
reconciliation in the camp. . The outbreak
of hostilities took 'place just at the time
that the committee was considering, plans
for putting a labor ticket in the ' field at
San Jose, with the^hope of capturing the
works at the spring election in that town.
It is highly, probable that the work of
extending the organization to other locali
ties will be suspended ! pending the war

CHRISTMAS SHOPPINGS.
BRIGHT sunshine and an air as crisp and cool
as if it were ordered by Santa Claus to fit the
season of his coming have brought the Christ
mas shoppers already from their homes to the streets
and the shops where the holiday goods are gleaming.
The larger stores are already thronged with seekers
after novelties and with purchasers, for the wise shop
per does not at this season postpone buying to an
other day. The shops that,are thronged now will be
crowded next week. The article that most attracts
may be sold by to-morrow. This, therefore, is the
time to buy promptly and avoid the rush.
Every aspect of the time promises a. Christmas sea
son of unsurpassed merriment and' happiness. The
people are prosperous and have bright prospects of a
greater prosperity ahead. They are in harmony with
-the festival season. We are at peace with the world
and with one another. In politics an era of good
feeling has set in. Virtually there is but one party in
the country." No formidable attack is now being
made upon sound money, protection or any other
feature of the legislation upon which our industries
are based. So, too, for a time at least, the strife be
tween labor and capital that disturbed both the East
and the West a few months ago has passed away.
The mills are running, the wage-earners have money
for a merry Christmas, and among all classes there
is that cheerful contentment which is more potent
than money in making a glad holiday.
The merchants of the country have foreseen the
increased demand for Christmas goods and have pro
vided the shoppers with an ampler stock from which
to choose than ever before. The advertising columns
of The Call reflect the increased, and increasing
business of the tirrjfi. Persons Who cannot make* up
their minds what to buy can find a multitude of sug
gestions from our advertisements. There are novel
ties or useful gifts for all kinds of people. Santa
Claus is a great manufacturer. He knows how to
suit every taste, and this season he has done his
best.
Christmas shopping is enough like haymaking to
make it worth while doing it while the sun shines.
We cannot count on the continuance of such bright
weather through all the days from now to Christmas.
Next week the streets may be wet and sloppy with
rain, and then the shopping will have to be done un
der conditions that make it disagreeable and to some
extent difficult. For the present everything is pro
pitious to the shopper. So pleasant is the weather
and so bright the stores that it is a temptation to
wander among them for the mere pleasure of the
outing. Just now neither the park nor the public art
galleries show up so attractively as the shops, and
under the conditions that prevail the shopping itself
may be accounted one of the best pleasures of the
holiday season.
It is questionable whether any other city in the
world presents such a picturesque and radiant ap
pearance as does San Francisco in these afternoons
and evenings when the shoppers and the sightseers
are out in something like full force. The San Fran
cisco type of feminine beauty shows well in walking
costume. Forms of lissome grace animated with
California vigor, faces that glow with the beauty of
rosy cheeks and starry eyes, do not need the acces
sory of ballroom dress and ornaments to give them
an attractiveness that delights every faculty of the
mind. Consequently .their presence on the streets
in such numbers as are now to be seen during busi
ness hours give to the city a truly festal brightness.
We are evidently about to celebrate the merriest
Christmas in our history, and are making ready for
it early. â¢
A curious story comes from New York City to the
effect that a thief went into a police station and stole
a pair of fine shoes belonging to the head of the de
tective force in that district. It would seem that in
looking for dews the chief must have been going
round barefooted.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY,: DECEMBEK 12, 1901
KEEP. COOL.
THIS is a good time for the American people to
keep cool and conserve their wits on the., sub-*
ject of tariff, free trade arid reciprocity. ' 'A;
strong and energetic movement is being mzyde byj
Cuba to break into 'our markets, compete with our
agriculture, obsolete certain of our valuable crops,
disuse our land and, labor and- strike "a blow â¢ at pro-v
tection at the precise point where it needs friendsâ
our rural interests and people.
Remembering their success in driving this country
into a^war that was avoidable and was being avoided,
by the splendid diplomacy of President McKinley,
the Cubans have organized another junta in New
York. ,It is full jeweled, well stocked in etiquette
and exchequer and was on the ground in Washington
before Congress arrived, picking off the individual
members as they arrived. The* cry of this junta is,
"Open your markets to our sugar # and tobacco, or we
will have a panic!"
The old junta cried, "Spend your blood and money
for our liberty, or we perish!" We did both. We
spent a half billion of dollars, and lives that we could
ill spare. Now they demand that our taxpayers do
nate to them a clear profit of $200 per acre on*their
sugar and tobacco lands, or they will have a panic!
General Wood, our military. Governor of the
island, is away from his post in aid of this anti-panic
gift to Cuba. He is alleged to have said to Senators
that Cuban sugar and tobacco should occupy our
markets as "essential to giving Cuba that degree of
stability which was contemplated when the United
States dispossessed Spanish rule."
With" all due respect to General Wood in his ca
pacity as a soldier, we remark that he is uttering non- .
sense, rank, <fefiled and gibbering nonsense.
The American people resent it. What folly to say
that we assumed the duty of always making Cuba
prosperous, of always assuring a profit on her staple
crops, of always filling her dinner paill Yet that is
our obligation as interpreted by General Wood and
the junta. They have been encouraged by President'
Roosevelt's message on reciprocity. We think they
have read that message with their greed rather than
with their understanding. The President says that
"reciprocity is the handmaid of protection."
We all favor reciprocity, as did President McKin
ley, when and where it leaves protection unbreached
and unweakened. Otherwise it is the same as free
trade to us and we reject it. The precise point at
which we can least afford to smite protection is the
point attacked by this new junta, which presents its
appetite as patriotism and comes holding out its hat
for alms. "Reciprocity is the handmaid of protec
tion." Cuba wants ro borrow our handmaid. because
we are bound to make Cuba prosperous and prevent
panics I
It is as much as we can do by careful legislation to
preserve the conditions of prosperity for our own
people. We are not abroad on any such Quixotic
errand as that of Santa-Clausing prosperity into the
stockings of people who don't wear stockings. The
junta ha9 misread President Roosevelt. The hand
maid they want to borrow is in our service, not in
theirs. ,
President Roosevelt's cordial indorsement of the
policy of providing for extensive irrigation of the
arid lands of the West has had the effect of awakening
the Eastern people to a consciousness that sooner or
later the Government will adopt the policy > and ac
cordingly they are getting ready to accept it. As the
Philadelphia Ledger puts it, "the West is bound to
have irrigation and the East may, as well- be good
natured about, it."
THE MERCHANT MARINE BILL.
O ENATOR FRYE is reported to have stated
that he has reason to believe his merchant
marine bill will be found to have met all the ob
jections made by certain Republicans to the measure
submitted at the last session of Congress, and con
sequently he looks forward to a prompt adoption of
it by both houses. That the Senator is over
sanguine is made evident by criticisms which have al
ready been pronounced upon the measure by Re
publican critics. It is clear, then, that once more
we are to have a prolonged discussion on the subject,
and it may be another postponement of the adoption
of a system of promoting our merchant marine.
It is not easy to understand why loyal Republicans
should persist year after year in demanding a mer
chant marine bill that will suit everybody. No such
demand was made of the framers of the tariff de
signed to protect our industries upon land. Had it
been made and insisted upon there would never haiVe
! been a tariff. Party unanimity can be attained on
matters of detailonly by mutual concessions, and
such. concessions are right arid proper. When men
are agreed that a certain policy is wise, right and
needful it would be foolish for them to refuse to
undertake it solely because no practical measure of
accomplishing it could be devised which in every de
tail and respect accorded with the judgment or wishes
of every individual.
The Republican party has been able to enact
legislation upon every important issue except
that of providing for our merchant marine. Every
pledge made in the platform upon which McKinley
was first elected to the Presidency has been fulfilled
except that relating to American shipping. Mem
bers of Congress managed to agree upon every other
subject, but upon this there has been a persistent
disagreement, and now, after the stanch advocates of
upbuilding our marine have endeavored to conciliate
all, there arises once more the old cry that the bill
is objectionable in this feature or in that.
A merchant marine bill that will suit the individual
ideas of every Republican in Congress" i9 not to be
expected. If we are to wait until such a bill be
framed we shall never have an American merchant
marine upon the high seas that is at all commensurate
with our needs. In making up a tariff Republicans
did not wrangle over particular schedules. They de.
sired a protective tariff, and in due time they enacted
one. It may be objectionable fo this man or that in
some one or more particulars, but as a whole it sat
isfies the country, It protects our industries. It
brought an immediate return of prosperity to capital
and to labor. If, however, that policy had been
created in the same way as the principle of protecting
American commerce on the seas has been treated we
should be to this day exposed to the competition of
European cheap labor, and our. prosperity would be
Measured by a much lower standard than it is. *
In his address at the Charleston exposition Sena
tor Depew, in referring to the failure of the 'United
States to obtain a fair share of South . American
trade, said: "Our failure to capture or hold what is
legitimately our own is due to the fact that we have
abandoned the sea. Our country, with its superb
energy and limitless productive powers, but. without
an adequate merchant marine, is like Hercules
chained to his forge, or an eagle clipped of. its wings.
Until ships under the American flag are carrying
American merchandise and establishing ; routes and
ports and banking facilities for American commerce,
we cannot possessor enjoy our inheritance. When
the isthmian canal is opened, built, owned and con
trolled, as it' will be, -by the United States, our pov
erty on the ocean .will make it the opportunity of our
rivals." s
No, intelligent man will question the truth of those
statements. - We are losing markets solely because we
have abandoned the seas to European shipping. It
is time to put an end to that foolish policy. The
.Erye bill, therefore, even if not absolutely satisfactory
to everybody, should be enacted. The country needs
it, the Republican party has promised it, and the
people demand it. - . .
Senator Warren of Wyoming is quoted as having
said recently of the reciprocity treaties: "These
treaties expired by limitation and cannot be revived.
It is questionable even whether new treaties can be
negotiated and submitted under the two year restric
tion of the Dingley act." It is said that other Sena
tors hold the same. view, and it is therefore possible
we may see the reciprocity question settled satisfac
torily by being dismissed from our politics altogether.
THE NEW YORK PROGRAMME.
WHEN on the eve of the assembling of Con-,
gress the Democratic caucus met for the
purpose, of nominating candidates for the
Speakership and other offices, there was presented,
from the New York delegation a set of resolutions
outlining a policy for the party to pursue in dealing
with the principal issues that are to come up during
the session." As the resolutions made no mention of
silver, a member from Texas promptly moved to sub
stitute the Kansas City platform. A wrangle ensued
and then the whole thing was referred to a"! com
mittee.
To the general public the affair appeared to be
nothing, more than another of those factional fights
which have now become something like a regular
part of the proceedings of every Democratic meet
ing. It was therefore passed over as an incident of
no particular import, and comparatively little atten
tion was paid to it.'
'It now appears, however, by reports from New
York, that the incident has a larger significance than
appeared on the surface. The resolutions, which are
now spoken of as "the New York programme," were
part of a plan devised for the purpose of. harmonizing
the gold and the silver wings of the party 'and putting
the "programmers" in a position where they 'would
have advantage over all rivals in the struggle for party
control. It seems to be conceded that the resolu
tions were not written in Washington, but were
drawn up and discussed in New York and sent on to
Washington for presentation to the caucus. Had it
not been for the vigilance of the silver man from
Texas the scheme might have gone through, and
Democracy might now be half-way pledged to .some
thing in the way of a programme that would leave
Bryanism out of sight long before the next Presi
dential election.
There was, moreover, a. certain amount of New
York politics involved in . the programme. It is
stated that the scheme was worked out by Tammany
politicians, though it is by no means certain that
Croker dictated it. According to these authorities
the plan was designed for the purpose of displacing
David Bennett Hill as the leader of. Democracy in
New York, and consequently a possible nominee for
the Presidency in 1904. Hill has repeatedly said that
at this time the Democratic. party should .not adopt a
platform, but await developments, and had the New
York Congressmen succeeded in getting the repre
sentatives of the party in the House to accept the
programme ' offered them Hill would have been side
tracked and would have been compelled either to
follow the Tammany lead or fall out of the Demo
cratic procession. ' t .
The scheme failed because the Southern and West-
em Democrats in Congress do not lilje to accept a
New York leadership. They resent the assumption
of the New Yorkers and are still sore because of the
failure of New York Democracy to support Bryan.
That feeling led to the rejection of the programme
as presented to the caucus. The fight, however, is
not yet over. The committee to which the caucus
resolutions were referred is to report as soon as,Con
gress reassembles after the holidays, and then we may
hear much more of the programme and get a further
understanding of what it means and whom it is de
signed to crush.
Democratic members of Congress are* said to be
waiting impatiently for Gorman to returnto the Sen
ate,i.an event which is expected to take place next
March. It is their belief that once in the Senate he
can formulate a policy for the party, and should he
succeed they are ready to support him for the Presi
dential nomination in 1904. â¢ ...
It is hardly likely the proposed Congressional in
vestigation of Maclay's "History of the Navy" will
amount to anything. The charges made against
Schleyhave caused it to be excluded from the list of
text-books at Annapolis, and if Congress will abstain
from advertising it the thing will soon be out of print
and forgotten.
According to reports from New York the outward
manifestations of the recent copper deal were nothing
to the true inwardness of it, and there is talk of get
ting up some kind of legal investigation that will turn
it inside out and show how the wheels worked in the
interior. . . ,
If Tom Johnson can aspire to the Presidency be
cause he was elected Mayor of Cleveland, why should
not General Patrick Collins of Boston have a boom
and proceed to order a hat so much too large for
him that it can accommodate a Presidential bee?
â¢The way in which the whirligig of time brings
about its revenges is going to be shown by the f^ct
that those who did not share in the rapture and the
cost of the, opera season are going to have a fatter
Christmas than many of those who did.
Secretary Gage hit the nail squarely on the head
when in referring tothe policy of granting subsidies
to build up the American merchant marine he said:
"The expedient is temporary, and prompt results are
desirable." ' . â¢;â '.< : ' : -l

COMPETITION IN GAS PERMITTED
UNDER PROVISIONS OF CHARTER
EDITOR The Callâ Sir: Will you please inform a sub
scriber through your paper whether the gas company
has a right under the law and the franchise it holds to
charge different rates for supplying gas to its custom-
"â -'- 'â¢â¢. ers?- Some of the residents of this section are paying
$1 25 per 1600 feet, while the writer is obliged to pay $1 45
because he refuses to sign a contract to take gas from
the Pacific Gas-_ Improvement Company for a term of years
or otherwise to continue to take from the Pacific providing an
opposition company lays mains and offers to supply to con
sumers. If all of the gaspayers would foolishly sign the con
tract this enterprising Pacific Company, submits we never
would have an .opposition company, for the good reason that
the new. company would have no customers to look to for the
sale of its gas. Some districts are getting gas as low a3 50
cents a thousand, while all In this district outside those who
have already, bowed to the will of the gas monopoly, are pay
ing $1 40. Does j the law and the ' franchise under which this
company exists allow of such discrimination? Respectfully,

of pearls . are found in the oysters flshed
off the coast of Ceylon'; the average is one
in every ten oysters. A plan of making
pearls grow at will was submitted by one
Linnaeus to the- Swedish Government, and
that was. to bore a small hole through the
shell of a river mussel and Insert a small
grain of sand so as to afford a nucleus- for
a pearl. He established the practicability

It is the largest of the. three great sym

part of the abdomen, behind the stomach
and in front of the aorta. It consists of
an intricate network of toerves associated
with the ganglia, receiving the upper
splanchnic nerves and some branches of
the vagus and giving oft numerous
branches which accompany the arteries
to the principal viscera of the abdomen,
constituting secondary plexuses. Its two
principal masses, right and left, are

108 Cal.: "The right of a riparian owi;er
to the waters of a stream, flowing through

clash with a still lower rate, say $1 20, the Mayor believes that
the consumer signing it would still have the right to claim
the rate fixed by the Supervisors.
"The question, however, whether any cutting of rates
should be allowed," said Mayor Phelan, ."is an interesting
one. The charter says the Supervisors shall fix 'a rate.* Does
that mean a maximum rate or a rate that shall prevail in all
cases? There would be this reason for the latter interpreta
tion: A uniform rate for the entire city would tend to equal
ize conditions, and a resident downtown near the gas works
or the mains would not enjoy the advantages of cheap gas
at the expense of the consumers in outlying districts..
"The right of a gas company to grant a rate lower than
the rate fixed under our charter has never been tested in the
courts. So long as we have the competitive system it Is for
the public good that competition be untrammeled. I should
like to see either ..municipal ownership of gas or a gas monop
oly with stringent regulation by the Supervisors, with a uni
form rate for all districts, from which, of course, there would
be no reductions." mi^m

STORMY VOYAGE
FROM FLATTERY
Shjp Wiliiam H. Smith
Has a Rough Trip
Down Coast. V
Heavy Seas Sweep Her From
Stem to Stern, Causing
Much Damage.
The ship William H. Smith. Captain
Colly, which left Tacoma twenty-seven
aays ago, reached port yesterday after a
stormy voyage. Captain Colly says Cape
Flattery was passed November 15, and an
hour later the ship was in a heavy south
east gale, with a heavy fog, which con
tinued until December 5. During all thia
time there was a succession of gales from
the south and southeast. Heavy seas were
shipped, the bulwarks were stove in, one.
boat was smashed, the wheelhouse was
carried away, and all the companion ways
were flooded, and the cargo shifted.
On December 4 a ship with the head of
the foremast and main topmast carried
away was sighted. The William H.
Smith â went close enough to see the crew
at work repairing the damage, but could
not discern the vessel's name. As the
vessel. did not make any sig-nals or ask
for any assistance the William H. Smith
stood away on her course. The vessel
was seen in latitude 44 degrees 20 minutes
north and longitude 128 west.
The American ship Luclle, eighteen
days from Oyster Bay and bound for
Keher, H. I., was repprted outside yes
terday afternoon with her foremast car
ried away. When seen by the observer
at Point Lobos she was evidently at
tempting: to make port, but up to a late
hour had not succeeded. The Lucile was
about fifteen miles out when sighted, but
as no signals of distress were flying no
tups went to her assistance.
Nippon Ma.ru Sails for China.
The Nippon Maru of the Toyo Klsen
Kaisha sailed yesterday afternoon for
Yokohama and Hongkong, with the fol
lowing passengers:
For Tokohama â C. W. Atkinson. M. J.
Heney, K. Kimura, Kobayashi, James Lowry,
Y. Mayeda, B. Minarl. K. Nanjo. R. Pacheco,
H. A. Stevens. F. Â§chmitz.
For Shanghai â A.vâ¬hartln, A. Fabre, C J.
Hession, J. Moreau, G. T. Foole.
For Hongkong â Mrs. C. H. Barth and child.
Mies E. Bittman. Miss A. C. Baldwin, Miss

way, Mrs. A. L. Foye. Miss M. Martyn, Wil
liam Rich. William Straughan, Mrs. William
Straughan and child. Dr. Milan Soule, Mrs.

There were ISO Chinese on the steerage
returning home for the New Year holi
days. A woman named Dye Choy left
the vessel at the last moment at the so
licitation of Miss Cameron of the Presby
terian Mission and her relatives.
Harbor Commissioners Meet.
Considerable business was transacted
yesterday at the meeting of the State
Board of Harbor Commissioners. Pay
ment was ordered made of the bills of the
San Francisco Timber Preserving Com
pany for the treatment of spring and
cluster piles in ferry slips 1, 5, 6 and 7, and
constructing and repairing clusters in
slips 5f 6 and 7. The number of piles
treated was 665, and the amount of the
claim was $15,118 13. Other demands,
amounting to over $7000, â were also ordered
paici.
The Johnson Locke Mercantile Com
pany asked for a rebate of $12 25 in
wharfage fees, caused by a two hours'
delay of the steamer Hyades at Main
stTeet wharf, on the night of November
30. when the fog was so heavy on the
bay.
F. S. gtratton, formerly attorney for the
board, presented a request for a hearing
relative to his claim for extra compensa
tion for services as special counsel in the
case of S. C. Irving and the "Paraffine
Paint Company against thQ State Board
of Harbor Commissioners. No action -was
taken.
The request of Colonel Oscar F. Long,
general superintendent of the United
States army transport service, for 'an ex
tension of Folsom street wharf, was re
ferred to the chief engineer.
Chief Wharfinger Percy Henderson re
ported that William H. Young was about
to build a wharf on State property on the
north side of Channel street, 'west of Fifth
street, 1S3 feet long, with a frontage of
ninety-one feet for the use of Wilson
Bros.' Company, lumber dealers.
The chief wharfinger recommended that
the request of the Santa Fe Railway Com
pany for the establishment of a fairway
from a point at Main street wharf No. 1
to Point Richmond, as outlined in a map
filed with the board, be granted. The
chief engineer concurred in the report of
the chief wharfinger, and favorable action
was taken.
A. H. Foster, assistant to the manager
of the Southern Pacific Company, pre
sented a request from the 'Expressmen's
and Draymen's Association of Alameda
County, requesting better facilities for
the housing and storing of freight re
ceived at the foot of Market street and
intended for points across the bay. The
petition was referred to the> chief engi
neer.
Hannah Bros, were awarded the con
tract for constructing sheds on pier 19
Union street wharf, for $12,973.
Plans were considered for a new pier
at Broadway, to be about 800 feet
long and 110 feet wide, which will cost in
the neighborhood of $70,000, and is expect,
ed to be one of the finest on the front
Bids for its construction will soon bo
awarded.

A special dispatch from Boston May 5,
1909, to the New York Sun, gives as new
regulations or the Boston Board of
Health as to barber shops: "Mugs, shav-
ing brushes and razors shall be sterilized
after each separate use thereof. A spear-
ate, clean towel shall be used for each
person. Material to stop the flow of blood
shall be used only in powdered form, and
applied . on a towel. Powder puffs are
prohibited." Wherever Newbro's "Herpl-
cide" is used on face or scalp after shav-

A Note of Caution.
The New York circular of Henry Clews, the
well-known banker, sounds the following ad
monition:
"The situation in some respects Is very re
markable. Never before were stocks eo highly
concentrated, and the steadying power result
ins from this process Is highly significant.
Apparently the powers in control are Able to
hold the market impregnable against all or
dinary assaults, and while this situation lasts
judgment must be directed accordingly. At
the fame time stocks are being slowly scat
tered srd the large sums of money seeking in
vestment may enable the market leaders to
cuccesffully l'srhten their burden if prosperity
continues sufficiently long, an 6ome are bold
enouph to believe it will. But the business
situation is spotty. Great activity is apparent
in the Sron trade, where the physical revolu
tion in railroad standards Is causing an ab
normal demand for iron. There is also great
prosiÂ«?rity in the coal trade and an active de
rrand at |jrofltable prices for many articles of
food and clothing. Prices for these are the
higheet in ten years and people are spending
v.istlv more on luxuries and commodities ap-
I^alins to esthetic tastes than usual. Econ
omy is the exception and extravagance the
ru> and how long this will continue no one
knows. There are Â£ign& of reaction which only
the blind will not see. and they demand cau
tion. We will soon begin to visibly see the
effect of the corn crop failure' and the conse
quent less of freight to lines traversing the
corn belt. As a result prices of cattle feed
have risen abnormally. Another blow is the
shrinkage in the cotton crop, which must ad
versely affect important sections of the South.
Hifch prices and scarcity are not conducive to
continuous prosperity in spite of a delusion to
the contrary which some people entertain.
Still another unfavorable feature has been the
declines in our exports, which, though perhaps
not permanent, indicate a cessation of the ex
cessive trade balances which have been a fruit
ful source of self -congratulation. Our exports
of copper 'declined about $23,000,000 during
the first ten months of 1901 and our exports of
iron manufactures showed a loss of $24,000,000
in the same period. Such factors as these can
not be ignored. They are signs of our being '
et or near the top and common prudence die- ]
tales caution in transactions entering into the |
future." *,

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. ll.-The usual year-end
activity of the money markets of the world
was the feature In to-day's stock market, to th-Â»
exclusion of almost .every other consideration
The darkening prosi>ect of the money outlook
v.-as mere oerceirtible in New York than in
other markets, and tiiis was partly due to the
fact that New York was called uoon for re
lief from other money markets. Kngaceroentfe
were made of gold for shloment to Berlin of
*50Â«,iÂ«0 and as much more rumored, the repined
Khipi>er declining to confirm tiie report and
of over $100,000 in French coin to Paris' De
posits ct the Sub-Treasury were made for
transfer to Chicago of $050,000 and to New
Orleans -of $150,000. This depletion of nearly
S2.0C0.OO0 fn'cash was offset by a payment
from the fiuh- Treasury of $1. 549.141 in re
demption of United states bonds. But thU
not FUfflclent to prevent a late flurry in the
tall money market again, when belated borrow
ers S3ught to cover their needs, which ran thi
rate up to 10 per cent. The Sub-Treasury had
already taken from the market over $4,000,000
before the day's operations including deposits
tor transfer to the interior. The hope that
the hither money rates here would attract
prompt remittances from the Interior is not
pufficlent to overcome anxiety, in the face of
those officially reported transfers to the in
terior. It was rcrwrted to-day . that Chicago
banks had loaned some money on call on the
Stock Exchange, but this operation presumably
involved the drawing opon a. New York bank
correspondent and is therefore an unsettling
influence in the local money market. The
course of the loan account of .Tew. York banks
Ik. beyond rrevieion in advance of the weekly
bank statement, but last week's unexpected In
crease in lo&ns keeps sentiment uneasy. â â 
various syndicate operations remain to be pro
vided for. Belief in' the purchase of the Poca
hontas Coal Company by Norfolk ana Western
ccatinut-s prevalent In Wall street, in epile o(
lack of official confirmation, which w'ould in
volve larce loan operations. The sharp de
cline In Norfolk and Western was connected
with UJs belief. There was acute 'weakness
in the forsisn exchange market to-day in
response to the stiffening of money rates, and
the outgo of gold is supposed to be in the na
ture of an-outricht bullion purchase designed
to Btrecethen German bank reserves for their
annual showing rather than to yield a profit
as a regular exchange transaction. There wae
some appearance of nursing the market on the
part of insiders here and there, bo as to suffer
as little damage as possible from the inevitable
liquidation. The comparative firmness and re
siliency of Amalgamated Copper was an ef- 1
fective aid in this purpose. The dealings in !
that stock a-rain overshadowed the whole mar
ket, the price rising to 72% and falling again
to 63^4. closing with a net gain of %. There
was a midday rally, when the redemption of a
large b'-ock of Government bonds was an
nounced, which carried many stocks above yes
terday's level, Lackawanna rising 4% and
Delaware and Hudson, New York Central and
Sugar about a rjolnt. Prices .generally fell
back to the lowest in the late selling .move
ment and closed not much better. The trans
continentals and the local traction stocks were
the principal sufferers. Baltimore and Ohio
and Norfolk and Western also fell 2% each,
Colorado Fuel 5%, Brooklyn Union Gas 9 and
General Electric 4. .
Bonds 'were active and irregular. Total
sales, par value. *3. 470.000. United States old
and new fours and the fives advanced % per

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Dec. 11.'â Universal selling -in
grain to-day placed the control of the markets
in the hands of the bears and practically routed
the big bull campaign 'that has terrorized
shorts for the past week. Liquidation ' and
short selling enough to press prices down 2Vic
tells the day's story in. wheat. Support was
lacking so .far as. -country .buying was con
cerned and even a large number of the coun
try holders who helped prices upward last
week were now unloading. Commission houses
took advantage of a fair advance from yester
day's prices at the opening and deluged the
pit with selling orders.' Cables were the only
bull Influence and these were . but a small fac
tor. May opened ] /i@%c up to a shade lower
at 82%@81%c and at once started on the.down
ward slide. .. Several bearish conditions- were
present to help the slump. Receipts were lib
eral, both Northwestern and primary. -Clear
ances were small and the cash demand was
only moderate. There was a rapid run of fluc
tuations, but by noon : prices . had . touched
79;4c, almost 4c loss since Monday. At such
declines shorts covered well for profits and at
the close May reacted slightly, but closed very
weak l%c. lower at 80%@80&c. |
Business in corn was less heavy than in
wheat, but the tendency favored 'the bear side.
Shorts took advantage of every soft spot to
cover, however, and â  temporary reactions were
the result. The close was weak, with. May lc
lower than yesterday at 66%c. . -
Oats shared In the general weakness. May
closed lc lower at 45%c. . â  â¢
Provisions were weak, but- not so much so
as grains. The natural tendency was toward
higher prices, but the grain Influence could
not: be fought off. Country, selling brought
some depression. - January pork . closed 25c
lower, lard 2%c down and ribs 7%o lower.

tablished in copper prices at London. Quoted
values there declined 15s and closing prices
were Â£54 7s 6d for spot and Â£54 5s for futures.
The -local market, : however, was. nominally un
changed: â¢ London tin' market was Â£1 7s 6d
lower, closing- at Â£110 15s for spot, and Â£104
10s for, futures. The local market, following
the break in London, with an- additional Im
pulse of larger spot supplies and a liberal
amount of tin near by: afloat, was about %c
lower, -closing with spot quoted at 25%c sellers
and weak at the declined Lead was unchanged
here at 4%c- and. London was also unchanged
at Â£10 15s. ' Spelter was quiet and nominally
unchanged at New York at $4 45 and London
was as last-.quoted at Â£16 5s. Iron was quiet.

WHEATâ The foreign . . markets were weak
and Liverpool and Paris futures were both
lower. Broomhall's cable reported heavy rains
in the Argentine, and said that the Liverpool
decline was due to American selling.
Chicago declined from 81%c to 80%c, and was
nervous and' unsettled. <Â« Liquidation was very
heavy with further selling expected on this ac
count, though offerings were well absorbed and
the crowd was heavily short. Farmers' deliver
ies were reported falling off. The farmers in
the Northwest were holding back their wheat,
while the Southwest was a large 'buyer. The
Trade Bulletin gave â¢ the I following â  status of

hf- > ;Â»,i n i >l i rSl i ance of a conspiracy entered into
b> this defendant. Brown, and others, warrants
were issued for the arrest of Hall and the oth
ers and alto search â¢warrants. These warrants
J^f^LfT Md h S oncersâ tMÂ« defendant in
4 .articularâ exceeded bis authority m the pro-
The men were arrested and brought to Look
c\i t and Calvin Hall was on Monday dismissed
on the charge of burglary and Immedlately
atterward charged with petty larceny. Hall
was released on his own recognizance and
never afterward was a warrant issued for his
aiTest. The examination of the other defend
ants was not proceeded with, but finally Hall's
trial was eet for May 31.
Between the 25th and 30th of May various
excursions were made by the defendant and
others to Mary Wilson's place and Calvin
Hall's place. These places were visited several
times by parties, sometimes headed by Con
stable Carpenter and sometimes by Deputy
Constable Brown. The premises were searched".
Martin "Wilson was among those arrested on
the 2Eth of Slay and we will prove that at
the time he was arrested a rope was placed
around his neck by Eades or Levanton and
that he was hanged to a rafter until almost
â¢lead to make him confess. On the evening of
ilay 30. Brown, with Levanton, Roberts, Isom
Eades and others, went to Hall's place. Hall
was 74 years of age. They ransacked his
premises and placed him under arrest.
In making the arrest Brown forced Hall
along toward a. wagon, he protesting and offer
ing some resistance. This defendant struck
him from behind. Hall was refused the priv
ilege of talking to Agnes Wilson, a little girl.
Ke was taken to Lookout and kept in custody.
In the fore part of the night all of the prison
ers were sleeping in the barroom of the Look
out hotel. Adjoining the barroom was a bed
room in which Calvin Hall slept. Constable
Carpenter was in charge of the men until after
12 o'clock. After Carpenter went home Brown
took charge of the prisoners and a few min
utes later a boy named Sidney Goyett came.
Fifteen or twenty minutes after Brown ar^
rived twelve or fifteen men ca.me to the hotel. <
<i:sjx!aved one pistol and a rifle, pointing one
&i Brown and one at Goyett, and commanded
them to throw up their hands, which they
promptly did. The mob . divided into squads,
threw themselves on the men, tied their hands
behind them and gagged them, the material
being sunny sacks. After the prisoners were
gagged and tied the mob took them from the
hotel, having put ropes around the necks of
some cr all of them.
They took these four men down the street
to the bank of Pit River. There are two
bridges, one over a slough and the other over
she river. On the first bridge they hanged
Frank Hall and the others they hanged to the
bridge over the river.
When the mob first entered the barroom two
or three proceeded into the room in which Cal

the room in his nlghtclothes to the bridge and
there hanged him with the others.
While Deputy Attorney General Post
proceeded with his statement there was
a constant volley cf objections from the

bitter clash between him and Post Raker

POLICE FIND
STOLEN GEMS
Diamonds Taken From
Portland Hotel Are
Recovered.
Negro and a Woman in His
Company Are Arrested
in Omaha.
OMAHA. Dec. 1Lâ W. H. Woods and a
female companion, giving the name of
True Johnson, both of whom are colored,
were arrested by the local police to-day,
charged with having robbed Alfred F.
Lowenthal, a traveling salesman for a
New York jewelry firm, in a Portland, Or.,
hotel, of $15,000 worth of diamonds and
Jewelry.
The jewelry was traced by a local pawn
broker, who had received a printed cir
cular describing the stolen property, to
Woods and his companion, and they
were found in the east part of the city.
When arrested there was found in their
possession $3000 worth of diamonds and
jewelry, and a check for $200, which had
been given by the pawnbroker in ex
change for a diamond brooch. The wo
man denies having any Knowledge of
where the jewelry came from; and Woods
refuses to talk.
The robbery occurred November 17,
when Lowenthal stopped at a hotel in I
Portland for the night, lie left his sam
pie cases in his room and went ; to sup- |
per. When he returned they had been
broken open and the more valuable part I
of their contents carried away. Tnere :
were 223 diamond brooches, ninety-three
scarf pins and a large number of diamond
rings among the missing articles. /
Last Monday the Johnson woman called
at the office of a Douglass street pawn- .
broker with a brooch, on whicn the ;
broker made a loan of J200, for which
amount he gave his check. The woman
gave her address and left his office. He
then examined the brooch and found it to
be identical with the first article named
in a printed circular he had received de- â 
scribing the jewelry stolen from Lowen- !
thai. He immediately notified the police I
and two detectives were detailed to call
at the address given by the woman, but
found no one there. They made a second
call with more success, finding the woman
and Woods at the place, and both were
placed under arrest.
The Portland police have been notified
and a man is now on his way to this city
to identify the jewelry found in the pos
session of Woods and- the Johnson'
woman.
The police found on searching the house
ten diamond pins, three studs and a ten
pcint diamond set star of sunburst. Two
large diamonds adorned Woods' cravat
when rre was arrested and he had a ring
valued at $150. On several fingers of the
woman were also diamond rings of con
siderable value. It was their plan to
leave for the West within the next twelve
hours. The Johnson woman denied ail
knowledge of the robbery, claiming that
she had recently inherited money which
she Invested in diamonds. She was ar
rested in this city last spring and con
victed of robbing a man of $25. The police
say she was in Portland at the time of
the robbery in that city.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 11.â Detectives
have been watching a colored man here,
who is suspected of having robbed A. F.
Lowenthal of $10,000 worth of diamonds at
the Portland Hotel November 21, and It
is understood that he will be arrested this
afternoon. The police assert that he com
mitted the robbery and then turned the
booty over to Woods and several com
panions, who went direct to Denver from
here, and who were arrested in Omaha to
day. The delay in making the arrest of
the real culprit, the pÂ«lice state, was for
the purpose of recovering the stolen dia
monds. Lowenthal and a Pinkerton de
tective left last night for Denver, where,
it Is said, others connected with the rob
bery now are.
Calvin Hall on a charge of petty larceny.
On May 31 at 1:30 o'clock the Justice Court
was called. Calvin Hall was found to be
dead and the complainant was not pres
ent. The record also shows that on May
25 a warrant to search the premises of
Calvin Hall to recover certain stolen arti
cles was issued.
During the introduction of the record
much time was devoted to argument as
to its admissibility. Post asked that the
jury be excused from the courtroom until
the argument was concluded. Judge Har
rington remarked that perhaps it would
be best to devote the first two weeks to
argument and then proceed with the trial.
The defense did not cross-examine Myers,
as his testimony related only to the au
thenticity of the record of his court.
E. L, Carpenter was next called to the
stand. The defense at once objected to
Carpenter being allowed to testify, on the
ground that during the opening statement
by counsel for the prosecution Carpenter
was charged with having been one of the
conspirators against Hall. During the
argument the court excused the jury from
the courtroom. After the objection by the
defense was overruled the jury returned.
Carpenter said that he was the con
stable of Lookout Township and that on
the 25th day of May he served a warrant
of arrest on Calvin Hall. He was ac
companied by Isom Eades and R. B.
Levanton. two of the men charged ln the
indictment, and that the game warrant
commanded the arrest of Mary Wilson.
Frank and James Hall, Daniel Yantis and
Martin Wilson.
The next question asked was as to what
method was followed in making the arrest
by Carpenter, Eades and Levanton. It
was objected to and a lengthy argument
on the admissibility of the question fol
lowed, during which Judge Harrington
excused the jury until 9:30 o'clock to-mor
row morning. The arerument was not con
cluded when court adjourned.

CHIEF EXAMINER MORAN
Board of Works Complains to Mayor
That Secretary Gives Out Pri
vate Information.
The Board of Public Works will file a
written complaint to-day, with Mayor Phe
lan to the effect that Chief Examiner
Moran of the Civil Service Commission
had slven out Information of a. private
nature to the public regarding affairs per
tinent to the administration of the .'two
boards. Commissioner Mendell, president
of. the Board of Public Works, charges
Moran with having written at -least two
articles concerning the prospective remov
al of George W. Dutton, inspector of
street sweepings, and the alleged refusal
of Superintendent of Buildings Barnett to
employ an old man who had passed the
civil service examination.
There has been bad blood between the
two boards for several months past ow
ing to the disinclination of the Board of
Public Works to be Intimidated into ac
cepting ellgibles furnished by the Civil
Service Commission. Caustic letters have
passed almost, daily between President
Freud of the Civil Service Commission
and â¢ President Mendell of the Board - of
Works. Moran says that the last named
board has repeatedly put obstacles in the
way. of the introduction of the merit sys
tem In Its department, while Mendell
claims that the commission of which Mo
ran Is secretary has been inclined to be
dictatorial In the matter of appointments.
Moran denies that he gave out any in-

F. A. Greenwood gave a dinner to a

the beautiful . red room. The decorations
were in harmony with the perfect ap

terday by Mrs. George L. Bradley and

dence, 2224 Clay street. The tea was given
in honor, of Mrs. Guy Scott, who as Miss
Leila Voorhies- was a belle of the smart
set. More than 200 guests thronged the
prettily decorated rooms. The affair was
a delightful i one. -The members of the ex

Many visitors crowded the Maple room
of the Palace Hotel yesterday afternoon
and evening and examined the beautiful
objets d'art- placed -on exhibition by tho
California Keramic Club. The tables were
laden with the handiwork of the members
and proved very attractive.- â  The collec
tion of vases, ornaments and useful ar
ticles : is the prettiest ever presented . by
the organization. Every article gives evi
dence of the skill and artistic ability of
the ladies who prepared it for exhibition.
The decorated chinaware is probably the
formation and laughs at the charge that
he wrote articles for the newspapers. It
is not thought that Mayor Phelan will
resort to any drastic measures for the
purpose of disciplining Moran, but that
the latter will be mildly reproved and
cautioned not to be too loquacious in fu
ture is almost certain.

On Sunday night comes a vivid re
minder of America's most revered actor,
Joe Jefferson, in the shape of his son
Thomas, who during the last three sea
sons has succeeded to his great father's
famous roie in "Kip Van Winkle." The
mere fact that his father has put him out
at the head of his own company and to
keep the illustrious name of Jefferson
before the public is in itself sufficient
guarantee that the young mail has
enough talent - and histrionic ability to
sustain the reputation the elder Jefferson
won during his sixty years on the stage.
The accessories will be Identical to those
used by Joe- Jefferson In the East. The
advance sale will open this morning. .

Uko all of Sardou's dramas, sufficiently
sensational. It has a comedy interest in

author's work, and is pleasing good
houses . this week. "Diplomacy" will be
a popular revival of Miss Seligman' s en
gagement and will be presented next
week.
"The Electrician" is one of the most
characteristic Central productions that
has been seen at the uptown house. It
is crammed with mechanical and electri
cal sensations, and the various "effects"
are, of the most realistic description.
,Those who like that kind of thing cannot
do better than go up to the Central this
week. They will get it full strength and
unadulterated. "Muldoon's Picnic" is an
other; sort of picnic that will follow "The
Electrician" next week. -

Interesting Cablegram Is
Bead to the Catholic
Federation.
Women Are Given the Priv
â¢ ilege of Joining the
Society.
CINCINNATI, Dec. 11.â The American
Federation of Catholic Societies, suggest
ed at a conference last winter, temporar
ily organized at Long Branch last sum
mer and permanently established hero
this week, will hold its first regular na
tional convention in Chicago July 15, 1903.
In addition to a membership ot over halt
a million of the laity represented here this
week, this Federation has received the
indorsement of the Pope, the American
Cardinal, the Archbishop of this province,
a half dozen Bishops who have been pres
ent and of a great many in the priest
hood. It is, however, an organization ot
laity. All the officers are laymen.
1 The only question regarding member
ship was that of the admission of women.
The committee on constitution did not
report in favor of their admission, but
the convention took it up and after a Ions
and animated discussion decided to ad
mit them.
The objects of the Federation are stated
to be "the cementing of the bonds of'fra
ternal union among the Catholic laity and
Catholic societies of the United States;
the fostering and protecting of Catholic
interests and works of religion, piety, edu
cation and charity; the study of condi
tions in our social life, and the dissemina
tion of the truth."
i During the evening session the follow
ing cablegram was read by Bishop Mc-
Faul and received with three cheers, fol
lowed by continuous demonstrations:
"ROME, Dec. 11.â His holiness , most
lovingly grants- hla apostolic benediction
to the American Federation of Catholic
Societies assembled in national conven
tion In Cincinnati.
"M. CARDINAL RAMPOLLA."
: A number of addresses followed the
reading of the cablegram from the Pope,
the most prominent being by- Father

FEW PEOPLE REALIZE
The Danger in That Common Disease,
Catarrh.
Because catarrhal diseases are so com-
mon and because catarrh Is not rapidly
fatal, people too often overlook and ne?
gleet it until some incurable ailment de-
velops as a result of the neglect.
The inflamed condition of the membrane
of the nose and throat makes a fertile soil
for the germs of Pneumonia and Con-
sumption, In fact catarrhal pneumonia
and catarrhal consumption are the most
common forms of these dreaded diseases,
which annually cause more than one-
quarter of the deaths in this country. '
Remedies for catarrh are almost as
numerous as catarrh sufferers, but very
few have any actual merit as a cure, the
only good derived being simply a. tempo-
rary relief.
There Is, however, a very effective rem-
edy recently discovered which is rapidly
becoming famous for it3 great value in re-
lieving and permanently curing all forms
of catarrhal diseases, whether located !n
the head, throat, lungs or stomach.
This new catarrh cure iÂ» principally
composed of a gum derived from the Eu-
calyptus tree, and this gum possesses ex-
traordinary healing and antiseptic proper.
ties. It is taken Internally ln the form
of. a lozenge or tablet, pleasant to thÂ«
taste and so harmless that little children
take them with safety and benefit.
Eucalyptus oil and the bark are some-
times used, but are not so convenient nor
so palatable as the gum.
Undoubtedly the best quality is foumj ia
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, which may bo
found in any drug store, and any catarrh
sufferer who ha3 tried douches. Inhalers
and liquid medicines will be surprised At
the rapid improvement after a few" days*
use of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, whtca
are composed of the gum of the Eucalyp-
tus tree, combined with other antiseptics
which destroy the germs of catarrh in th*
blood and expel the catarrhal poison from
; the system.
: Dr. Ramsdell in speaking of catarrh and
its cure says: "After many experiments
I. have given up the idea of curing catarrh
by the use of inhalers, washes, salves or
liquid medicines. I have always had tJiÂ»
best results from Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets; the red gum and other valuable anti-
septics contained in these tablets make
them, in my opinion, far superior to any
of the numerous catarrh remedies so ex-
tensively advertised." The fact that Stu-
art's Catarrh Tablets are sold in drus
stores under protection of a trademark
should not prejudice conscientious physi-
cians against them, because their un-
doubted merit and harmless character
make them a remedy which every catarrh
sufferer may use with perfect safety and
the prospect of a permanent cure.
For colds in the head, for coughs, ca-
tarrhal deafness and catarrh of the stom-
ach and liver, people who have tried them
say that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are a
household necessity.

DISPUTE OVER
WATER SUPPLY
Supervisors Listen to the
Protest of Giant Gap
Company.
Russell Dunn Charges the
City Engineer With Ig
noring His System.
The Public Utilities Committee of ths
Board of Supervisors met yesterday for
the purpose of hearing the protest of
Russell Dunn against the acceptance of
the recommendation of the Board of Pub
lic Works that the city acquire a munici
pal water system from the headwaters of
the Tuolumne River. Dunn, who, withC.
Alberger, made an offer to sell to the city
the Giant Gap water supply" from; the
north fork-of the American River, charges
that his offer was not fully investigated
by Chief Engineer Grunsky, on whose re
port the Tuolumne River supply was se
lected. Much of the time was devoted to
wordy, tilts between Grunsky, Dunn, At
torney Gould, representing the Giant Gap
Company, and Chairman Reed of the
committee regarding the estimates of cost
of the two systems.
Dunn asked Grunsky if he knew what
the ' axea was of the watersheds of the
reservoirs of the Giant Gap supply. Chair
man Reed desired to know why the ques
tion was asked, and Dunn replied:
"Because I want him to admit that he
does not know." .
Reed objected to asking Grunsky to ac
knowledge any shortcomings which Dunn
might think the city official was guilty
of. . Attorney Gould said the auestion was
asked in good faith in order to show that
Grunsky had not investigated the repre
sentations made by the Giant Gap pro-:
maters. The question was withdrawn be
cS&se the United States Geodetic Survey
could; furnish the data..
/.To* a auestion put by Grunsky, Dunn
/feaid that the total cost of his system as
projected would be $17,400,000, including a
distributing system, but excluding land
values for reservoir sites. The power
houses would be placed in Auburn and
the cost would include the power derived
from 100,000,000 gallons of water.
"I could build - a distributing system,
which City Engineer Grunsky estimates
will cost $7,000,000 for $500,000 less," sard
Dunn. "The main receiving reservoir
would have a capacity of 200,000,000 gal
lons. My. plans of construction are simple
and less expensive than Grunsky's."
"Mr. Dunn has evidently made his esti
mates low in order to make them attrac
tive," replied Grunsky.
, Attorney Gould took exception to Grun
sky's remarks .and was proceeding to ex
plain his .client's position, when he was
sharply called to order by Chairman
Reed. :
Grunsky stated that the Board of
Works had reported that the Giant Gap
Company had nothing of value to sell
and If a comparison of cost were to be
made the Giant Gap Company's estimate
would be increased to $26,000,000 to dupli
cate the Tuolumne system, whose cost is
estimated at $38,000,000. On the basis of
the amount to be delivered by each sys
tem, the cost of the Giant Gap project
would be $700,000 per 100,000,000 gallons and
of the Tuolumne scheme $640,000.
Commissioner Manson contended that
the Giant Gap scheme was impracticable
and the question of cost was subordinated
to securing a supply of pure water. Reed
favored acquiring as an auxuiliary sys
tem the supply of the Dumbarton Point
Land Company, drawing v from artesian
wells in Alameda County, which has been
offered to the city for $450,000.
The committee requested the City Engi
neer to file a new . estimate on a sinele
pipe line from the Tuolumne to supply 40,
000,000 gallons and to be connected with
the Dumbarton Point system.

ommends Abandoning Proceed
ings Against Corporation.
The Supervisors' Public * Utilities â  Com
mittee decided yesterday to abandon all

Accuses Clara Ellis of
Trying to Decamp
With Funds.
Clara Ellis, who was appointed admin
istratrix of the estate of Mary Abrock.

the funds left by Mrs. Abrock. John

davit filed by the accuser, issued an or
der directipg the woman to appear in
court and tender an account of her stew
ardship. .
According to the affidavit, Clara Ellis

tate December 7 of this year. The estate
consists of money in various banks

Immediately after receiving authority

THE SAN FKANClSCCi CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1901:
COMMENCES S ENSATION A L SUIT
TO RECOVER VALUABLE ESTATE
Walter Harrison of Orland,' Glenn County, Claims That He Is the
Natural Son of the Late Bachelor H; W. C. Nelson, and a
Bitter Contest With lnteresting ; ;D]sclosures Is Now Certain
pTpÂ«aHE filing of a, suit in the Superior
.11 Court, of Glenn County" by. Walter
I . Harrison to recover the $150,000 es-
JJÂ» tate of the late H. W. C. Nelson
on the ground that he is the
only son of the deceased has created
a genuine sensation in and about Willows
and Or^and. where the parties to the
action live and are -well known. # ' â 
Nelson was a bachelor farmer who lived
four miles from Orland for nearly forty
years prior to his death In May, 1900. Har
rison is 23 years of age and until the
action in question was brought was gen
erally supposed to be tne son of Mr. and
Mrs. Harrison, both of whom are now liv
ing on the Nelson farm. It is said Mrs.
Harrison admits that Nelson was the
father of the plaintiff In the present
action, and that there is abundant testi
mony to prove the nature of the relation
ship of Nelson and Mrs. Harrisan for
many years, and that the contestant is in
fact the son of the deceased capitalist
farmer.
Nelson was a native of Missouri and 70
years of asre at the time of his death. He
settled in "Glenn County about I860, and
took up a place on Stony Creek,. where he
began to farm and raise cattle with a part
ner named McClannahan. The latter be
came 'a squaw man, and married an In
dian woman of more or less beauty. On
her death some" years later McClannahan
married again, and considerable domestic
trouble followed. Nelson wept for the
misfortunes of his partner, and vowed he
would never marry. This vow he kept,
but his celibacy seems not to . have pre
vented the trouble after his death which
he declined to invite during his lifetime.-.
Employs a Housekeeper. â â ' ''-. : : :';'.
A few years after beginning his faou-
Ing operations near Orland, Nelson. fotHr.I
it necessary to employ assistance.' One
day Mr. and Mrs. Harrison came to^tha,
farm and requested employment. The man
was strong, and the woman was fair to
look upon. The result of the meeting was
the employment of the couple, the man to
work about the place and the woman to
serve as housekeeper. Soon after the Har
risons took up their residence with Nel
son the neighbors observed that NeLion
paid considerable attention to the wife of
his hired man. As the latter never made
any complaint, the neighbors had no fault
to find. And thus things went on for
thirty years.
Nelson died full of honors in May, 1900.
WELLS CLASHES
WITH TREASURER
Brooks Declares Auditor
Plots to Have Son" '
Retained. ~i
Treasurer Brooks and Auditor "Wells
had -another clash yesterday, which re
sulted In some interesting disclosures*.
Wells made a declaration that he wa3
consulting with his attorneys with a view
toward holding Brooks, responsible for
paying coupons of Dupont-street bonus,
and the latter retaliated by charging the
Auditor with scheming to have his son,
William Wells, who is now his deputy,
appointed to a deputyship in his office
before the father retires from political
The trouble between the two city offi
cials was precipitated when Brooks was
informed that Wells had intimated that
he would decline to accept Brooks'âac
counts covering the payments of Dupont
street bond coupons and that tne Treas
urer would be held responsible on his
bond for 'the money which he had paid
out. Incidentally Wells remarked that
Brooks would have to make good the
moneys he had paid out on court orders
which had not been countersigned by the
Auditor.
Treasurer Filled "With Anger.
As soon as Brooks learned of the Au
ditor's intentions he fairly bristled with
anger and said:
What is the matter with that old man? He
has been talkinff asrain. .Why, he certainly
knows that : he has absolutely nothing- to | do
with the payment of the DuDont-street bond
coupons. The Supreme Court has decided that
the city is not liable for their payment. The
property-owners in the district- affected were
assessed to pay for the improvement, : but they
either refuse to do so on the ground that the
bonds are illegal or else they pay under pro
test. The latter was the : case of a property
owner who recently desired to sell, and as
funds were thus made available to redeem
some of the cusons I paid out some $2000 on
bonds in the order of their registration. â¢ I am
clearly within the law and do not fear the
Auditor's threats.
It teems that Wells is always making
trouble of some kind. I know that the reason
for his holding up the demand of Daniel Gor
dan and Henry Zemansky, who were promoted
by resolution of the Supervisors to $160 posi
tions in the Registrar's ft that Wells
Is endeavoring to coerce Mayor Phelan into
recommending; that an additional deputyshlp
be created in the Auditor's office before he re
tires. His object is to make a place for his
son. who is now his chief deputy and who will
be retired with his father.. The scheme is to
oust one of the clerks receiving $100 â  per
month and to raise the position to the dignity
of a deputyshlp at a salary of $125.
Brooks Informs the Mayor.
I told Mayor Phelan that he should not be a
party to such a plot as he could not afford to
do it, simply for the sake of. having the de
mands of Gordan and Zomansky audited. Why,
Wells' has refused to sign the demand of a
clerk in my office, G. A. Harris, who Is re
quired to- pay rebates to small holders of per
sonal property. Harris is working at the risk
of not receiving: any pay, but if he should quit
the payment of the rebates would cease with
him, as I have no other clerk to do the work.
I told ' the Mayor, however, not to let that
stand in the way of his refusing: to consent to
"Wells' little scheme, and I trust' it will not
be consummated.
far aa the payment of court orders are
concerned, I acted under the Code of Civil
Procedure, which permits the payment of court
orders on direct presentation to the Treasurer.
If the courts are called upon to decide that
end of the dispute I have no doubt that I will
be upheld. ' "

The Harrisons were present at his .bed
side, and Mrs. Harrison closed his eyes
when the fatal summons came. After the
funeral a will was looked for, but none
could be found. Those who were active In
the search for the document were four
half-brothers named Nelson, Mrs. High
tower, a half-sister; Mary Nelson and
Hallie Short, nieces, all living at Orland.
In addition to these there' is a nephew
named Dr. ! Johnson living In Texas.
All of the interested people were â  noti
fied of the situation, and with their .con
sent W. W. Nelson was appointed admin
istrator of the estate, and in due course
notice to creditors was given and the
other legal formalities pending the settle
ment of a large estate were gone through
with under the supervison of the Probate
Court.
it apepars that after the probate pro
ceedings were instituted, young Harrison
claimed an interest in a lot of hogs be
longing to the estate, and as his claims
were not recognized suit was brought
The action resulted in a verdict against
Harrison. He then brought an action to
recover wages which he claimed Nelson
ov/ed him, but this action likewise failed
for. lack of legal proof. The affairs of
the estate and the Interests of the heirs
at-law were guarded by Attorney Frank
Freeman of San Francisco and Attorney
C. L.. Donohue of Willows.
Claims of the 'Alleged Son.
Although the troubles existing between
young Harrison and Nelson's heirs had
occasioned considerable gossip through
out Glenn County the dispute was nearly
forgotten when the filing by Harrison of
his . sensational suit revived popular in
terest in the case. That , Harrison is a
picture of Nelson as he was in his life
time,' even the Nelsons who are resisting
his claim are forced to admit. They will
admit also that young Harrison has many
of the characteristics of the dead Nelson,
not the least important of which are per
sistency and obstinacy. These admissions,
however, count for nothing, as Harrison's
relationship to the dead bachelor is a
matter of legal proof which must be ad
duced in court, if it is honed to win the
suit. This the heirs of Nelson allege Is
impossible, unless perhaps Mrs. Harrison
is willing to take the stand and. testify
that her son Walter is Nelson's son and
not the son of her legal husband, whose
paternity of five other children is not dis
puted.
That there are some of the Nelsons .who
believe the* allegation of Harrison as to
his relationship to the dead capitalist Is
evidenced by the fact that Mary Nelson
SAILS IN QUEST
OF HIDDEN GOLD
F. D. Spaulding Tells of
the Mission of the
W. S. Phelps.
Gllding "out of San Francisco harbor
without a word of explanation as to her
destination, the mission of the schooner
W. S. Phelps occasioned much comment
on Saturday, and rumors have been added
to until they have been magnified Into
proportions alarming and even bristling
with the acute possibilities of internation
al complications. Captain R." W. Nye be
fore sailing was reticent and the crew
bore themselves as phantoms. Were they
bound for South America to aid one side
or the other of the combating- forces? or
if the reported capture of the British gold
fields in the Northwest Territory by an
armed band was about to be realized
their movements could not have been
more .mysterious.
Others asked, was it the expedition of
a bold party of fortune .seekers to seme
as yet undeveloped Eldorado dotting ;he
Southern seas?
That a mystery was and is observed in
the movements and the ultimate desti
nation of the schooner is not doubted.
F. D. Spaulding of Tehama street, who
Chartered the ship and In whose bosom
rests the secret, gives assurances of the
legitimacy of the expedition. But still the
lovers of mystery are groping deep in
doubt and speculation. Speaking ; of the
matter yesterday Spaulding said:
"There is positively no mystery sur
rounding the departure of the ship ,W. S.
Phelps. She was chartered from Captain
William Johnson by myself, several of
those aboard .her and certain other parties
in this city, but whose names I absolutely
decline to divulge. I will go so far as to
say that we have what we believe to be
reliable information relative to a deposit
of gold the location of which I nor any
of my associates will divulge until we
have prospected and secured concessions.
There has been so much said that I am
pleased to have the opportunity through
The Call to deny emphatically the reports
that have been circulated as to any mys
terious packages or any mystery of ariy
sort being connected with the enterprise.
It is strictly a legitimate business propo
sition, and the report to the contrary
which has been circulated in certain quar
ters is unwarranted and has caused an-
n "Asked ' at -what hour the-W. S Phelps
sailed from San Francisco Spaulding said
it was 9:30 .a. m. Spaulding further said
in reply. to a question that there was no
stranger aboard before or after leaving
port to his knowledge.: She will probably
not touch at any port for three months
from the date bf sailing. .
.Captain R. W. Nye, the skipper, Is an
old whaling captain and is well known on
the coast. As to the story of the ciew
or any part of it having at one time been
shipwrecked and marooned Spaulding de
nied the. whole thing as a romance with
not even a ghost of a foundation. He ad
mits, however, that the veteran Captain
Nye furnished the .Particulars.^ whicn
prompted and -promoted the expedition.
On being aÂ»ked if there were arms and
ammunition aboard, Spaulding admitted
that such was the case, but only^ what
might be actually needed by the crew for
hunting purposes. â¢ ' .
Spaulding said the crew was_ composed
of R. W. Nye, captain; W. P. Noyes, first
mate; G. U. Stevens, Fred Dyer, Henry
Smith, Frank JLukzie and John Wllbuiiv.

and Hallie Short, the two nieces, -who
are each entitled to a one-seventh inter
est to the estate, have taken up his
fight and cast their lots with him as
against the other heirs at law. Powers
of attorney and deeds have passed be
tween the litigants, so that in the event
of Harrison winning his suit the two
nieces will be amply provided for, while
the others will receive nothing. The at
titude of the parties to the action Is such
that a bitter legal contest is assured
when the case comes to trial.
Wrote to Mrs. Harrison.
The friends of Harrison claim there Is
no question that he is the son of ' Nel-
Bon. They declare that Nelson repeatedly
admitted the relationship, and that he
always spoke of Mrs. Harrison in
terms of the warmest endearment.
That his relations with Mrs. Har
rison were intimate and of : long
standing, it is alleged, was common gos
sip for years. Nelson sometimes left Or
land for trips to San Francisco, and on
these occasions it is said he would write
to Mrs. Harrison and inquire with solici
tude as to the welfare of "my boy Wal
ter." It is claimed that many witnesses
will bo produced to whom Nelson made
avowals. that Walter was his son. These
are some of the allegations of Harrison's
complaint now on file in the clerk's of
fice at Willows. ,
The parties to the action are prominent
in Glenn County business and social cir
cles. It is this fact which has centered
public interest upon the forthcoming trial
of "the suit.. Mrs. Harrison 'has â¢ not been
Interviewed, but it is said by Harrison's
friends that she will be the- leading wit
ness in the case. Considerable curiosity
is expressed as to the nature of the tes
timony to be given by her in her son's
behalf.
If the allegations as made in the com
plaint filed by Harrison are borne out by
the evidence â  the case will parallel that
of young Frederick Baldwin, who was
declared the illegitimate son of the late
Congressman William A. Piper, and
whose claim was compromised by the ad
ministrators of the Piper estate, for some
$250,000. Harrison's adherents claim the
evidence at his disposal ia incontroverti
ble. The principal point to be made by
him is his wonderful resemblance to the
deceased capitalist.
The Nelson estate consists of large land
holdings, livestock;' cash in the Bank of
Orland, of. which Nelson was vice presi
dent, stocks, bonds arid other securities
amounting to a little less than $150,000.

Sensation Develops in
"Morgan City" In
surance Suit.
A sensati.on was caused yesterday in
the United States Circuit Court in the
hearing of the suit brought by the
Joseph Ladue Gold Mining and Develop
ment Company against ; 'the Frankfort
Marine Insurance Company \ to recover
the sum of $18,888 arising: out of the loss
of the transport Morgan City ' off the
coast of Japan.
A letter was Introduced by the defense
to show that the plaintiff company was
not the sole party interested in the char
tering' of the transport to the Government,
as it had claimed, but that some fine
"pulling of wires" had taken place in the
East in order to induce the War Depart
ment to charter the Morgan City.
The letter in question was written by
E. F. Botsford, .treasurer of the Ladue
Mining Company, to Messrs. Barneson
and Chilcott, its agents in Seattle, and is
as follows:

The Ladue Mining Company owned the
Morgan City when she was leased to the
"United States Government for transport
work. Captain John Barneson and Rich
ard Chilcott of Seattle, Wash., acted as
agents for the company, in the charter of
the steamship. Â«Barneson is now in the
transport service in this city, and the in
surance company sets up a defense that
the charter contract was void, as Barno
son was a Government employe at the
time the Government renewed the steam
ship's charter. Barneson claimed; how
ever, that he made over his interest in
the firm to his father as soon as â  he was
appointed to the transport service. Judge
Morrow ruled that John Barneson. was
not a Government employe in the sense
that would render the charter contract
void. â 
Should the Fankfort Insurance Com
pany ask that the deposition of. Botsford
be taken in New York some interesting
evidence will be forthcoming as to the
identity of the parties who were "Inter
ested" in the charter of the Morgan City
and who had to be "placated."

Sldlowski told the Judge tnat he had
made a suit of clothes for Bowers, and
the doctor called at the store yesterday
morning with his wife and complained
that the suit had not been made of the
material ; he had selected, which Sld
lowski denied. Bowers got very angry,
and, putting his hand in his hip pocket,
said: "I'll fix you." A young man grab
bed hold of Bowers' arm, and after be
ing released Bowers seized a pair . of
shears and made for the tailor, threat
ening to kill him.
Sldlowski hurried out of the store and
made his way as quickly as possible to
the Hall of Justice. He waj very much
excited, and said he was afraid Bowers
would carry his threat into execution.
