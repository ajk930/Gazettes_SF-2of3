SAN ANTOKIO, Texas. DÂ«c 22.â By the
U'lapse of the City Market House in
Iracatecas. Mexico, f,orty lives have been
lost and more than a score of persons se
riously Injured, some of them so badly
that they cannot recover. Fifteen bodies
have been taken from the ruins and a
large force is at work clearing away the
debris In order to recover others, though
there is no hope that any of those caught
in the collapse of the big structure will
â¢be found alive. It is impossible at this
time to learn* the names of the victims.
Among those entombed were several offi
cers charged with the management of the
building.
The market house was one of the larg
est buildings in Zacatecas and was owned
by the city. Its lower portion was com
posed chiefly of cold storage cellars, in
which the local merchants stored their
perishable goods, and It was in the base
ment section that the fire started. The
flames had gained such headway that the
entire building was seen to be doomed
End the efforts of the firemen and citi
zens -were directed to saving goods In the
rtorag-Â« compartments in the basement
* and on the first floor.
Kuni3r<>ds of men fonatd into panire and
were busily engaged in the work of sav
ing- goods when the entire superstructure,
weakened by the rapidly spreading
flames, collapsed, crushing- and burying
dozers of men engaged in the work of
salvage. Those who escaped injury from
th*Â» blazing rains were so terror-stricken
that it n-as difficult to organize any ef
fort at rescue and those who had not been
killed outright could hear the cries of
victims in the ruins. There was no hope
cf rescue. The Fire Department Is poor
ly equipped and the supply of water in
adequate, so effective resistance could
not be offered to prevent the spreading of :
the fire.
The fire finally burned itself out, leav
lrig many unfortunates buried beneath
tons of wreckage. As soon as possible an
effort was made to get out the bodies
of the dead, but the heat drove back the
rescuers for hours and only fifteen of
those who were nearest the outer walls
cf the building could be removed. Exact
ly how many have been killed cannot be
known until the ruins are cleared away
end this work, with the primitive methods
Jn use, will occupy days.
The market house was one of the hand-
Fomest buildings in the city and was
erected a few years ago by the munici
pality to meet the demands of growing
business. It cost more than $150,000 and
in it were stored stocks of merchandise
valued at thousands of dollars. It was
one of the chief sources of revenue for
the city. The insurance on it was light
ar.d it is doubtful if it will be rebuilt.

CALL, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.i WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.-Has Presi
dent Roosevelt succeeded in "snuffing
out" the Schley controversy? This is the
question that Is being asked on all sides
in Washington. Nothing else is talked of
in army, navy and Congressional circles
than the sensational rebuke to General
Miles, the demand for Maclay's resigna
tion, the rejection of Admiral Dewey's
opinion that Schley was in command at
the battle of Santiago and the approval
of the findings of the court agains.t Ad
miral Schley.
Republican politicians are watching de
velopments with special interest. They
believe they see in the controversy # the
making of a Democratic candidate for
President in 1904. Some friends of Rear
Admiral Schley favor' running him for
President and thus seeking vindication at
the polls. As a matter of fact there are
Democrats who do not want to limit the
field of choice to Schley. General Miles
and Admiral Dewey have their champions
and General Miles is believed to be a
candidate for the nomination. The pre
diction is freely made that one of these
three will be the Democratic standard
bearer in 1904.
Plans of Schley's Friends.
Rear Admiral Schley occupies the lead
ing position at present and his friends
will let no opportunity pass to further his
popularity. The Schley question will be
constantly coming up In Congress. Re
publicans in the Senate are afraid of the
resolution of Senator Jones of Arkansas.
This extends the thanks T>f Congress to
Rear Admiral Schley and the officers and
men under his command for the victory
at Santiago. The resolution is favored by
several Republicans and practically all
the Democrats. Other Republicans, who
are opposed to the j theory of Admiral
Dewey that Schley was in supreme com
mand at Santiago, are uneasy lest the
resolution should reach a vote, because,
for political reasons, they would hesitate
to vote against it. It is expected that the
Schley partisans will press it for consid
eration in both houses. They want it to
get to the President. They feel that the
President will approve the action of Sec
retary Long in indorsing the findings of
the court of inquiry. They want to have a
resolution of Congress sent to the Presi
dent so that he will have to take the re
sponsibility of vetoing it. Then they want
to run Schley against Roosevelt at the
next Presidential election.
Veto by Boosevelt Certain.
This phase of the controversy has been
discussed very seriously by the party
leaders. The situation is bound to have
its embarrassments. Representatives
may hesitate and dodge, but no one who
has studied the President has any doubt
that he would refuse to approve any res
olution of Congress which sought to give
the credit for the victory at Santiago to
Schley at the expense of Sampson.
Lieutenant General Miles is in New
York and army headquarters officials are
silent about the Schley case. Officers of
the army generally approve the Presi
dent's action In administering a reprimand
to General Miles, and predict that it will
have a good effect throughout the service.
Admiral Dewey continues to observe his
rule of not discussing the Schley case for
publication. A friend acquainted with his
views said to-night that the hero of Ma
nila had rather expected the department
to disapprove his action in rendering an
opinion on the question of the command
during the battle. The admiral regards
the approval by Secretary Long of the
failure of the majority of the court to sub
mit a finding on the question of the com
mand as a quasi-censure, but is not dis
turbed over It.
Seek to Bury the Resolution.
One of the mosj. experienced politicians
on the Republican side in the Senate said
to-day:
"I am a Sampson man. I do not think
that Admiral Schley is entitled to any
more credit for that battle of Santiago
than any of the captains. Yet I do not
want to vote against a resolution extend
ing to Schley and the officers and the
men under his command the thanks of the
United States. The Naval Committee will
try to keep the resolution in a pigeon hole.
Whether it can keep it there is a ques
tion that has been carefully considered.
"The opposition is not so much against
Admiral Schley as against the proposition
to keep this scandal alive. It is time that
it was dropped. It is time to think of
something else. Yet the friends of Schley.
for the purpose of playing politics, are
determined to keep the thing going. We
all realize that it is hurting the navy and
is doing us an injury abroad. This the
friends of Schley admit, but they take the
position that their man has not had a fair

MACLAY WILL NOT RESIGN.
ITaval Historian Says President Is

NEW YORK, Dec. 22.â Edward Stanton

campaign, said to-night that he had net
yet received Secretary Long's letter, but
would probably get it to-morrow. Maclay
understood, he said, that he had been dis
missed, not requested to resign.
"I don't see," he said, "how the Presi
dent of the United States could violate
the civil service law by dismissing me.
If I understand it, a man regularly in
stalled under civil service regulations is
entitled to an opportunity to answer any
charges made against him. As I under
stand it this order is merely a dictatorial
order, and I am commanded to get out.
No cause or reason is given to me.
"If reports are true the decision will af
fect many thousands in the employ of the
United States. The President of the
United States is coming to a point where
he is establishing a precedent. I don't ex
actly know the law, but I passed a regu
lar examination with a 70 per cent record
and was appointed a special laborer.
"It is a most extraordinary case for the
President to single me out and tell me to
get out. If this Is the case civil service
is a hollow farce.
"President Roosevelt, I believe, made
his mark as a civil service champion. I
have nothing to say about any other part

Maclay's friends say he doesn't intend
to be kicked out without a fight, and
many predict that Roosevelt has a warm
proposition to deal with.

WA long step toward war has been
taken by Argentina and Chile.
Negotiations ," between the two

the controversy without the consent "of '
Chile to the King of England for arbitra

Senor Garcia Merou, the Argentina Min

following translation of a dispatch re
ceived from Senor Alcorta, the Argentina
Minister for Foreign Affairs:
"All efforts made by this Government
to reach an agreement in the diplomatic
reclamations presented to -the Chilean
Government having proved useless, and
after having exhausted all formulas for
a solution honorable to both govern

the decision of this Government to sus
pend all negotiations with Chile and to
refer the matter to his Britannic Majes
ty's Government without altering the
stae of peace which exists with the re
public of Chile."
Chile Opposes Arbitration.
It is not believed here that Chile will
be willing to permit the dispute to be
adjudicated by the King of England.
In administration circles a painful ap
prehension exists that the peace of South
America is on the point of being dis
turbed. Profound excitement prevails in
Argentina, and Chile is wrought to fever
pitch.
Both countries have been preparing for
a conflict. It is believed to-night that

Preparing for Military

Demand.
ERLIN, Dec. 22.â It is stated on
on eood authority that the Ger
man Government is preparing for
military action against Venezue
la in order to compel a settlement
of German claims against that country.
It is said that Germany has sent an ul
timatum to Venezuela threatening forci-
ble measures to compel the satisfaction
of German creditors of that country.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.â If Germany
occupies a Venezuelan port she must re
main in possession for several years be
fore she will be able to collect $15,000,000.
the amount of money necessary to repay
the loan granted and satisfy the claims
held by her subjects against the South
American republic.
This is the serious feature of the Ger
man-Venezuelan dispute, which makes
the administration especially anxious
that the revolution which has Just mani
fested itself shall succeed and that a new
Government shall be established which
will be disposed to comply with German
demands. If Germany should control
every Customs-house in Venezuela she
would have to remain In that country for
two years and a half before a sum suf
ficient to pay the claims could be raised.
If but a single port of La Guayara should
be seized, then her stay must last eight
years and probably longer, as these esti
mates do not take Into consideration the
use of any of the customs revenues for
support of the Government and are based
upon the continuance of the present an
nual value of Importations.
Where the Danger Lies.
Occupation for such a length of time
would assume a permanent character dis
tasteful to the people of the United
States, and herein lies the danger, so far
as the United States is concerned. In a
German seizure of a Venezuelan port,
provided Castro remains in power. If Cas
tro should be e'jected from office then the
administration Is hopeful that it will have
sufficient Influence with the new regime
to induce it to meet German demands.
Secretary Long said emphatically to
night that the German demonstration had
no connection whatever with the orders
to the battleship Indiana. Nevertheless
the selection of this formidable vessel is
not without significance. Secretary Hay
has assured the German Embassador that
the United States will not Interfere with
the seizure by Germany of a customs
port, provided permanent occupation be
not contemplated or attempted. At the
same time it Is the purpose of the admin
istration to keep a sharp watch upon
Germany In Venezuela, and at the slight
est evidence of permanent occupation to
step in and Inform the Berlin Government
that it must withdraw from the "Western
Hemisphere.
Embassador von Holleben has Informed
his Government of the formidable fleet
which the United States has assembled in
the Caribbean Sea, and, in the opinion of
authorities, the presence of this force
should prove to Germany the undesirabil
lty of prolonged occupation of American
territory.

SEEK MILLIONS
IN LAKE WATER
Silver Islet Mine to Be
Explored by Ameri
can Financiers.
Romantic History "Attaches
to the Search for
Treasure.
Special Dispatch to The'CalL
VANCOUVER. â  B. C. Dec. 22.â The Sil
ver Islet, the most famous silver mine
ever operated in Canada, may be opened
up again within a few weeks, if the pres
ent plans of an American syndicate of
financiers are" carried out. The great
shaft, twenty-five miles east of Port Ar
thur, on Lake Superior, is now flooded,
and the chance of again operating the
great mine hinges on the possibility of
pumping out the workings.
The Silver Islet was discovered more
than twenty-live years ago. A prospector
named Bronson had been sent by Ameri
cans to the district to look for copper and
found none, une day he happened to no
tice a square rock several hundred yards
out in the lake and had an Indian paddle
him out. The rock rose sheer out of the
water. Its appearance indicated that it
contained some mineral, but alongside in
the water, where the floor of the lake had
been worn away, there was a glistening
of white metal. This turned out to be
nearly pure silver, and the discovery was
the foundation of the opening of a mine
that a score of years ago was famous all
over the world. In five years' operation
it yielded $10,000,000 worth of metal and
paid dividends of $3,000,000 to the share
holders.
When the discoverer recognized the
value of the few samples he had secured
he returned to shore and later visited the
place alone. He brought an ordinary pair
of "blacksmith's tongs, and In the shallow
water from the bottom of the lake he se
cured $3000 worth of silver. But the mine
was under water, and it took the expendi
ture of a large amount of money before
any -further returns were obtained.
Captain Frue. the inventor of the Frue
concentrating â¢ vanner, came across the
lake from the Calumet and Hecla to take
charge of the new property. He built a
seawall to enclose the entire vicinity of
the islet, but this was swept away twice
by gales. Finally the islet was enclosed
and work was started sinking on the great
silver lode. This proved enormously rich
and the mine paid from the start.
In four years the shaft was down 1000
feet, and the 900-foot level was the rich
est part of the \o\n that had been encoun
tered. All this time the pumping system
had been added to. for the seepage in the
big shaft from the lake was tremendous,
until it took a lara;e steam tilant to oper
ate the pumps nlor.e. It was this feature
of the operation that caused the closir;?
of the mine iust when it was making most
moncv for its ov;ners. Coal was not ob
tained in timr and tho shaft was flooded.
New a corr.r.nnv of Americans has been
formed to put down a new shaf< nearbv
and to tap the workings of the old shaft

mine dry by that method. Tf the plnn

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACO1IA, Dec. 22.â Nippon Yusen Kai
sha, or Japan Mall Steamship Company,
has decided to build in Japanese ship
yards Blxteen steamers between now and
1907. These steamers will be used to aug
ment its great fleet now running to Amer
ica, Australia, London and up and down
the Asiatic coast.
The decision was reached to build them
thus early that the company may be pre
pared to meet the growing competition
offered by new steamers of other lines
running to the Orient. At the semi-year
ly meeting of the shareholders of , the
company, held at Toklo three weeks ago.
President Kendo made a lengthy report
covering the company's financial opera
tions. By his recommendation 500,000 yen
was added to the reserve for equalizing
the dividends. This reserve now reaches
3,300,000 â¢ yen, insuring the payment of 12
per cent dividends during the next year
and a half. He specially recommended
the setting aside of 1,000,000 yen per year
for developing navigation and improving
the fleet. By this move the cost of the
sixteen steamers will be largely provided
out of the company's earnings.
Mr. Tatsuo, representing the minority
stockholders, who desire larger dividends,
protested against accepting President
Kondo's recommendations, and especially
against the sum appropriated for rewards
to high officers of the company. He'was
almost unanimously voted down.
President Kondo's report showed net
profits for the half-year ending Septem
ber 30 to be 2,639,628 yen. The company's
receipts foe this period included: For the
carriage of goods, 6,927,2S8 yen; passen
gers, 1,383,190 yen; ships chartered, E13.201
yen; subsidies, 3,089,438 yen; bounties, 346,
963 yen.

weeping, and en T.eing pressed for an ex
planation she told Bauer that Kinstler
had repeatedly used violence toward her
in his absence.
On Saturday Bauer came to Phoenix in
tending to prosecute Kinstler, but failed
to find him, and was persuaded by a
friend to do nothing that would cause a
scandal. From here he went to Mesa
City and bought a pistol. A nephew of
Bauer named Adams on Saturday night
noticed his depression and arranged a
hunting trip for Sunday. He knew noth
ing of the trouble between Bauer an-1
Xinstler and Sunday morning drove up
to th<; house with the latter in the wagon,
having invited him to join them. When
the Bftuer family saw Kinstler in the
wagon Bauer secreted himself in a closet.
Adams came to the door and was told
Bauer was not at home. He reported to
Kinstler, who ran to the door and knock
ed. Mrs. Bauer opened it and Bauer cams
out of the clcsct and fired three times at
Kinstler, killing him almost instantly.

withdrawal of all Russian troops from Man
churia except the railway guard, the number
of which should be limited.
Second, they opposed the paragraph restrain
ing China from increasing the number of her
troops in Manchuria without consulting Rus
sia, contending that China must be at liberty
to maintain whatever force was necessary in
Manchuria to preserve order there. I
Third, they request that an early date bo I
fixed for returning the now Chwang-Shan Hal I
Kwan railway ar.fl a considerable reduction of j
the Indemnity claimed by the Russians for re
pairing and maintaining the railway.
Fourth, the Chinese plenipotentiaries opposed
giving Russia a monopoly of future mining con
cessions In Manchuria.
Prince Ching has received a long tele
gram from Chang Chi Tung, Viceroy of
Hankow, exhorting him to maintain the
sovereignty of China and Manchuria.

The ecclesiastical union of Beth Mena

not without effort and coaxing on the part
of those who believed that in unity was
strength and life and the assurance of a
perfect foundation. The accomplishment,
therefore, of the union between the two
churches was sufficient to draw together
the still powerful element of orthodox
Judaism, and through and with the aid of
the amalgamation is to be erected one

night, was met by a league committee, of
laymen and priests, headed by Mayor
Capdeville, and escorted to the new house
presented to him by the diocese. To-day
there was a formal reception and speeches
were made by the Mayor and Associate
Justice O. O. Provosty, in which a Cardi
nal's hat for the Archbishop was pre
dicted. The Archbishop, in reply, said he
could not discuss his mission, but assured
his people that he would rather be Arch
bishop of New Orleans than Emperor of
Russia. In the course of his speech th-j
Archbishop said:
The mission confided to me was difficult and
delicate and, t-o far as I was concerned, un
sought." Uy desire of the Holy Father and of
President McKinley I was In Paris for three
months during the negotiations between the
Hls'janio- American commissioners. After my
return from Cuba and Porto Rico. President
McKinley and the Holy Father wished me to

It was looking toward the establishment
then of such a temple that induced yes

day quiet, business neighborhood of Min

thrown up and folks looked out upon the
patriarchal procession bearing the holy
scrolls, which were being transferred
from Nevah Zedek to Beth Menachim
Streisand. Perhaps never before in the
history of the city has a scene so quaint
been enacted. As carriages drew up to
the doors of the Minna street temple a
crowd encircled them. Then came from
the vehicles rabbi and layman bearing
the precious scrolls, whereon is writ the
Ten Commandments. In the measured
and chanting procession were the Revs.

The shortage Is largely â in fact, almost sjn
tlrely â due to the lack of means for transport

AROUND MANILA
Goverror Refuses to Ex-
tend Military Rule to
Provinces. *
Soldiers and Scouts Engage
Insurgents and Kill
Twenty-Eight.
MANILA. Dec. 22.â General Chaffee has
recuested that the province of Tayabas
ht again placed under military rule ow
i:.g to the concentration there of insur
gents from the provinces of Laguna and
liiitangas, who are fleeing from the Amer
icans under General Bell. Acting Gover
nor Wright has refused the request, be
lieving that the constabulary operating
with the garrison will be sufficient to pre
serve order in Tayabas.
General Davis, with the concurrence of
General Wade, the department comman
der, has made a similar request for the
is-establishment of military rule at Misa
m!s. island of Mindanao, in order to fa
cilitate the suppression of the aggravat
â¢ing disaffection prevailing there.
It is reasonable to expect minor dis
turbances during the approaching dry
season after the harvest is gathered, as
ihe people of the provinces will 'then be
t:iio<^;upied.
Two native priests and two Presidentes
have been arrested for aiding the insur
gents. In addition to this a charge of
counterfeiting is made against them, an
outnt for making bogus money having
been found concealed behind the altar of
a church where the priests officiated.
Commissioner lde, who has been sick
for a week, is going to the hospital. His
â¢sickness is the result of overwork. All
the Commissioners are working very
hard. The absence of Governor Taft crip
ples the efficiency of the government.
The newspapers are agitating the ap
pointment of an additional lawyer on the
ccrumisslon.
The transport Meade reports having en
countered a typhoon, during which three
of her boats and hatches were smashed
and her cargo damaged. There were sev
eral accidents to her engines and ice plant
during the passage.
Troops Defeat the Insurgents.
Captain John S. Park Jr., with thirty
men cf the Twenty-first Infantry, encoun
tered sixty insurgents last week at Ala
minoa, in Laguna Province. Four of the
enemy were killed, several guns were cap
tured and their barracks were destroyed.
General Bell, who Is in command of tha
American forces in Batangas Province,
Luzon, has praised Lieutenant James D.
U Ufora, who while scouting with Troop D
of the First Cavalry routed an insurgent
force in that province.
Lieutenant Tilford located a rebel
stronghold on top of a hill near the town
of Batangas. He surrounded the enemy
under cover of night and attacked them
at daylight. Their surprise was complete.
Nineteen insurgents were killed while at
tempting to escape. Lieutenant Tilford
captured sixteen rifles and live hundred
rounds of ammunition.
A detachment of scouts of the Second
Infantry also had a email engagement
with the insurgents, in which they killed
nine men and captured four.
Lieutenant John D. Hartman of the
First Cavalry during an expedition en
countered the enemy six separate times
without losing one of his men. He de
stroved several barracks.
Army Expenses Are Still Heavy.
Every effort to decrease the expenses
of the American army in the Philippines
is having little effect owing to the in
crease of army stations, due partly to the
activity of the insurgents on the Island
of Samar, in Batangas and Tayabas prov
inces and in other places, and also to the
establishment of municipal governments
In many towns which has necessitated thÂ«
sending of troops there to preserve order.
General Chaffee, speaking on the situa
tion in the islands, said he considered
the conditions in the Philippines to be
hopeful, and that by the end of February
ail the turbulent provinces will have been
pacified. General Chaffee excepts the Isl
and of Samar, however, which will prob
ably require some months longer. There
the situation demands a policy of rigid
starvation and the giving of food only to
those who surrender or stay In the towns.
The closing of the port in Laguna and
Batangas provinces. In Luzon, ha^ had a
most salutary effect, as the measure ha3
resulted in touching the pockets of the
Manila Filipinos who have been aiding
the insurgents.
The former are anxious now for peace,
and are working to that end. In order to
hasten matters these Filipinos will co-op
erate with the forces under General Bell
In Batangas and Lacuna.
PANAMA COMPANY TOO
LATE WITH ITS PROPOSAL
Senator Depew Says It Could Have
Sold to the United States at
One Time.
LONDON, Dec. 22.â Senator Chauncey
M. Depew, in an Interview to-day, said
that had M. Hutln. former president of
the Panama Canal Company, offered to
sell the canal for $40,000,000, instead of ex
pecting the United States to dicker about
the price, the'TJnited States would prob
ably have bought the property. The Sen
ator said he believed the decision reached
yesterday by the Panama Canal Company
had come too late.
According to a dispatch from Paris on
Saturday the shareholders of the Panama
Canal Company adopted a report which
proposed, among other things, to adopt
as a basis of negotiation for the sale of
the canal to the United States the figrures
and declarations contained in the conclu
sions of the Isthmian Commission's re
port and tojjlve the officials of the canal
company power to close the discussion by
proposing a fixed price.

LOUBET UNVEILS
BAUDIN STATUE
Prance Honors Memory
of the Faubourg St.
Antome Hero.
Slight Conflicts Occur Be
tween .Nationalists and
Socialista
PARIS, Dec. 22.â President Lcubet un
veiled to-day In the Faubourg St. Antoine
a statue to the memory of Deputy Charles
Baudln, a representative of the people,
who was killed on the barricade of the
Faubourg St. Antoine on December 3, 1851,
the day following the coup d'etat of Louis
Napoleon. Baudin was memorable for the
reply he gave to the workman who re
fused to defend the barricade. To this
man Baudin said:
"You will see how a representative of
the people can die for 25 francs a day."
He then mounted the barricade. The
soldiers fired a volley and Baudin fell
dead.
There was considerable apprehension of
disturbances at to-day's ceremony owing
to the insistence of the Nationalist Presi
dent of the Municipal Council, M. Daus
set, that he be permitted to deliver a
speech, although he was not included in
the official list of speakers. The ceremony
had already been once postponed on ac
count of the attitude of M. Dausset.
The Socialists planned a counter demon
stration to the unveiling to-day. They
gathered in the faubourg, wearing red
flowers in their buttonholes as a party
emblem. Owing to the strong precautions
taken by the police, however, no serious
disturbance occurred, although M. Daus
set and 6ome of his colleagues of the
Municipal Council had a narrow escape
from rough handling. There were sev
eral slight conflicts between Nationalists
and Socialists.
All the French Ministers were present
at the unveiling of the statue. President |
Loubet; M. Fallleres, president off the
Senate; Paul Descanel, president of the '
Chamber of Deputies, and M. Waldeck-
Rousseau, the Premier, made speeches, in
which they eulogized the resistance of
fered by Baudin and his colleagues to the
coup d'etat, holding them up as an ex
ample for the future.
President Loubet said he desired to as
sociate himself publicly with the glorifica
tion of this victim of devotion to the re
public, against which the chief executive
had committed such an odious outrage.
He said he himself had accepted conscien
tious engagements before the National
Assembly which he would never violate,
and that any Caesarian enterprise would
fall in face of the vigilance of the Gov
ernment and the union of the republicans.
This declaration elicited cheers from the
assemblage and cries of "Vive Loubet!"
and "Vive la republique!"
The official party was driving away
when M. Dausset, surrounded by his
friends, approached the statue and deliv
ered a short oration, in which he declared
that he took over the statue in the name
of the city of Paris. His words were
drowned by outcries of the Socialists. M.
Dausset had to be escorted by the police
back to the town hall. â¢ He progressed
amid shouts and countershouts of "Down
â¢with Dausset!" "Down with the Nation
alist!" while the Nationalists sang the
"Carmagnole."
Many persons were arrested but were
subsequently released.

Contain Crane's Declination.
Special Dispatch, to The' Call.
PITTSFIELD, Mass.,' Dec. 22. â Governor W. Murray
Crane sent a letter to President Roosevelt to-day which
his closest personal friends here say declines the Secre

whether he had accepted or'not. He said that he would leave
Dalton for Boston to-morrow morning. The Governor said
that the contents of his letter would be made public from
Washington.
Governor Crane does not like Washington life and the
fact that his business interests are so large that it would be

STRIKES A BAR
IN MAKING PORT
Car Perry Meets Disas
ter During a Heavy-
Gale.
LUDINGTON, Mich., Dec. 22.â While '
entering Ludington harbor last midnight
during a heavy gale the Pere Marquette
car ferry No. 16 struck a bar, disabling
her machinery, breaking the main feed
steam pipes and letting great volumes of
steam escape. Michael Taft, a coal
passer, was scalded to! death, two other
coal-passers, whose names are unknown,
were terribly scalded and many other3
who were in the hold received bad burns.
Those aboard experienced great hardships
during the nine hours that followed be
fore they were rescued. The accident hap
pened at midnight and during the%re
mainder of the night there was neither
light nor heat on the boat, while the wind
was bitterly cold. Great seas rolled across
the deck and ice formed wherever the wa
ter fell.
The No. 16 arrived off the harbor from
Milwaukee after midnight after a hard
voyage. In spite of the heavy seas and
strong winds Captain Charles Thompson
decided to hazard an entrance to the har
bor.
The boat, at an unfortunate moment,
sank low in the hollow of a big wave and
struck the bar with terrific force, the
shock completely disarranging the ma
chinery. Left without power the car fer
ry drifted against the north pier, where
she pounded heavily until there were sev
eral large holes In her forward quarter.
Captain Thompson ordered the sea cocks
opened and the boat was scuttled in six
teen feet of water.
When day broke the life-savers, by
means of their cannon, threw a line to the
wrecked craft and began rescuing the
crew with their breeches buoy apparatus.
The entire crew of thirty-three men and
the body were taken off the wreck this
morning. One by one the men were haul
ed over the churning ice on the suspend
ed cable. The operation occupied four
hours and was witnessed with breathless
interest by an immense crowd. It is be
lieved that the No. 16 will #cove a total
loss. An attempt will be mace to pump
her out, but unless weather conditions
are perfect it will be almost impossible.
Great banks of Ice surrounded the boat
on all sides.
Boat and cargo are valued at $200,000
and are fully insured.

FORGERS DUPE
THE RAILROADS
Successfully Print and
Dispose of Many
Bogus Tickets.
Western Lines Lose Several
Thousand Dollars by the
Fraud.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 22.â A gang
of forgers of railroad tickets has been
operating in Kansas City successfully
during the last few weeks according to
H. C. Townsend. of St. Louis, general pas
senger agent of the Missouri Pacific Rail
road, who has been in the city investigat
ing the fraud with the aid of George H.
Foote, secretary of the local passenger
bureau. andJ. A. Stewart, general South
western passenger agent of the Rock
Island. Townsend said of the frauds:
The losses of the 'Western railroads will
amount to thousands, of dollars. There have
been three classes of forgeries. Some days ago
Foote discovered that a bogus perforating
stamp had been used to . Imitate the stamp
that is used to mark the tickets at the Union
Depot. The forgers tried to buy a stamp In
Chicago exactly like the one that is used at
the Kansas City Union Depot to stamp re
turn tickets, but the manufacturers suspected
something was wrong and refused to sell it.
The forgers were not baffled. They bought a
stamp that .is used' in banks for perforating
checks, changed the dies from "paid" to "K.
C. U. D."iand have used It on many forged
tickets. ,
The second class of forgeries ' Included con
ductors' train checks. The bogus ones are
fairly good imitations of the genuine ones, but
they have smooth edges instead of perfora
tions. Wholesale frauds have been commit
ted by using forged livestock contracts, which,
are exchanged for tickets. We have no means
of knowing how many bogus livestock con
tracts and conductors' train checks have been
used. I know that hundreds of fraudulent con
tracts were printed here in Kansas City. We
have evidence to show that a -Kansas City
ticket broker knows something about the for
geries. We have engaged an additional force
of detectives -and hereafter . conductors will
watch carefully for forgeries. The Missouri
Pacific has suffered severe losses', but our road
is only one out of many that has been de
frauded. . . - .
Dozens of the forged tickets have, it is
said, been secured by the railway offi
cials. . :â¢..<--
FOUND GUILTY
OF CONSPIRACY
Lawyer Sullivan Is Con
victed but Escapes
Imprisonment.
Chicago Jurors Leniently Fix
a Fine as Punishment
for the Crime.
CHICAGO, Dec. 22.-The Jury In the
case of Lawyer Alexander Sullivan, on
trial before Judge Abner Smith for con
spiracy to abet a fugitive from justice,
came into court to-day with a verdict of
guilty. As punishment the jury Imposed
a fine of $2000. This carries with it 'no
prison sentence. State's Attorney Barnes
demanded that Sullivan be taken to jail,
bat the court declined to enforce the de- i
mand, and Sullivan was permitted to |
leave the courtroom with his attorneys. j
Sullivan's counsel entered a motion for |
a new trial, which Judge Smith will act ;
upon to-morrow. Should this motion be j
overruled judgment tor $2000 will be en- |
tered against the attorney.
The charges against Sullivan were an
outgrowth of jury bribing scandals in
volving the Chicago courts.
Former Bailiff James J. Lynch, the
principal prosecuting witness in the trial
of Sullivan, was indicted for jury bribing
in December, 1898. At this time Alexan
der Sullivan was the general counsel for
the West Chicago Street Railroad Com
pany. Indictments charging bribery at
other times were found against Lynch.
He fled to Canada, but was induced to
return October 1. He declared that Sulli
van had induced him to bribe jurors. He
told his story to the Grand Jury, and In
dictments for conspiracy to assist and
persuade a fugitive from justice to get
without the jurisdiction of the court and
assisting and persuading the fugitive to
remain without the jurisdiction of the
court were voted against Alexander Sulli
van, Frederick St. John, juaward Maher
and Frank P. Murray. Separate trials
were granted on motion of Maher, and
Sullivan was the first selected to make
answer In court to the allegations In the
indictment. He was arraigned before
Judge Abner Smith. The trial lasted four
weeks and two days.

HOLIDAY SEASON IN TRADE.
FOR the next fortnight trade will probably be
dull throughout the country. This is the sea
son when the retailer has the field pretty much
to himself and the wholesaler is taking stock. The
latter will not report much activity until the middle
of January, and perhaps not then, if the weather
proves unpropitious. But as a rule the latter part
of January sees a revival in general business. The
present year, however, as previously mentioned, has
reversed the usual conditions, and we have had a
phenomenally lively wholesale trade almost up to
the' close of the year. Even now the jobbers are
doing a good deal more than in former years at this
season, and reorders for clothing and other winter
supplies" are probably more numerous than ever be
fore. As for the retail holiday trade of the country
at large it is extremely heavy, though the recent cold
wave throughout the West has naturally restricted
it. People are not disposed to travel miles across
country to buy holiday presents and other luxuries'
with the thermometer down to 10 and 20 degrees
below zero. Perhaps the cold weather had some
thing to <3o with the falling off in bank clearings last
week, the gain over the corresponding week last year
being only 6.6 per cent. The failures were 265,
against .292 last year.
The staples as a rule are quiet, the exceptions being
wool and woolen goods, boots and shoes, coal and
the other important rcccssaries of the season. The
iron and steel trade keeps up its rapid pace, with all
producing and manufacturing sections reporting
general activity, firm prices, and orders running far
into the coming year. Cars continue scarce, how
ever, and complaints en this account are as numer
ous as at any time during the past two months. But
in spite of this impediment to transportation the rail
roads are reporting an increase in earnings over the
corresponding period in 1900.
Wall street is still more or less unsettled, the gyra
tions of Amalgamated Copper keeping speculators
and investors on the rsgged edge. Copper has been
cut. a good deal of Jctc by sellers, and lead and tin
have been sympathetically affected. Talk of money
stringency, which does not seriously materialize, has
also affected the market, though as a rule when quo
tation* decline one day they recover the. next. Pow
erful interests are behind the market, and they see
to it that the general list of stocks is maintained at
fairly steady prices. There are too many vast enter
prises under sray at the moment to permit any seri
cus decline in Wall stieet if it can be avoided.
The local market remains about the same. The
retail holiday business has been favored by excep
tionally fine weather and the shopkeepers are reap
ing a Christmas harvest. The wholesale trade, as far
as indications go, is as brisk as at any time during
the past six months. Lines that were neglected in
the early fall are now remarkably active, and some
merchants are reporting the best December trade
they ever had. The season continues to extend bril
liant prospects, the banks, both in city and country,
are reporting plenty of loanable funds in their vaults]
collections arc good, and there are no failures suffi
ciently large to cause comment. Whatever may be
the signs elsewhere, there are certainly none unfavor
able in our neighborhood. Prosperity still abides
v/ith us and is expected to for an indefinite period
to come. Even the chronic croaker has gone out of
business and his hoarse voice has not been heard in
the land for a long time.
According to the statistics of the New York
Journal of Commerce the fire losses of the United
States and Canada up to December 1 amounted to
$150,874,050, so it is evident we have had a pretty
hot year of it in some localities.
Ever since the Guildhall speech made by the new
Prince of/Wales the British papers have been speak
ing of his abilities as a statesman, and not one of
them has been so disloj'al as to suggest that some one
else wrote the speech.
How would it do for the House to challenge the
Senate to a football match and rush that Philippine
bill through the Senatorial center before the middle
of January?
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1901,
ARMY AND NAVY DISSENSIONS.
FOLLOWING closely upon the censure pro
nounced upon Rear Admiral Evans by the
Secretary of the Navy comes the censure upon
Lieutenant General Miles by the Secretary of War.
Extending over the whole period from the first act
of censure to the second Tan the controversy over
the conduct of Rear Admiral Schley during the* San
tiago campaign. Thus there has been disclosed to
the country and to the world a condition. of affairs
in the highest ranks of the army and the navy which
is discreditable to a service whose honor ought to be
above reproach. >
The very existence of such dissension is itself an
evil so great that it matters little upon which side
most of the blame rests. It is inevitable that the pub
lic will take sides in these controversies. We may
be sure that while some persons will approve the ac
tion of the Secretary of War in censuring General
Miles there will be others who will approve the ut
terances of the lieutenant general and regard the cen
sure pronounced upon him as a wrong done to. his
honor. These partisan differences of opinion will
tend to subject the army and the War Department to
a popular criticism which will not always be fair, and
which will certainly tend to weaken the esteem in
which both have been hitherto held throughout, the
country.
For a long time past there have been frequent re
ports of dissensions in army and in navy circles at
Washington, but while these reports have, been in
directly confirmed by circumstantial evidence they
have hitherto been denied or evaded by the higher
officials of the Government. There has been a care
ful and considerate effort to keep them hidden
from the public and to prevent them from blazing
into open scandals. That cloak of decorum has been
withdrawn by the Secretary of War. In pronouncing
censure upon General Miles the Secretary throws
aside all pretense of an existence of harmony and
says frankly: "The present facts are that for sev
eral years there has been unfortunate and bitter con
troversy in the Navy Department â a controversy
generally deplored even by the participants as tend
ing to bring the service into disesteem at home and
abroad and to destroy those relations of mutual con
fidence and friendship among naval officers which
the interests of effective service require."
That statement from the Secretary of War em
bodied in an official censure upon the lieutenant gen
eral of the army is the most significant that has been
made in any document bearing upon the Schley
controversy. It is an express declaration from the
highest source that the Navy Department is torn by
dissensions which so far affect the minds of officers
of the highest rank as to prevent them from cor
dially co-operating to render the service effective
to the country. In the light of that statement many
facts brought out in the Schley court of inquiry take
on a new meaning.- It will be useless for high offi
cials at Washington to any longer make denials of
the existence of jealousies and antagonisms which,
however petty in themselves, have proven sufficiently
serious in their^ results to justify the Secretaiy of
War in saying They "destroy those relations of mu
tual confidence'' which are necessary to effective ser
vice. \
Such being the condition of affairs, it becomes a
duty of the administration to take steps to remove
the mischief-makers from the positions they now
hold. That such jealousies did not bring disaster and
something of disgrace upon the country during the
late war was due solely to the weakness of our foe.
What would happen should we be involved in a haz
ardous struggle with some first-class power, with one
set of officers trying to prevent another from achiev
ing success?
The story is an ugly one. The country is ashamed
of it. Such dissensions disgrace the service in peace
and endanger the republic in war. Something more
than censure is needed. The men who cause them
should be dismissed from the service. â¢ .
Among the fetes proposed for the coronation of
King Edward is one providing for a grand proces
sion of floats from the Tower to Westminster, like
that which was held when Elizabeth was crowned,
and if carried out it is believed it will be made the
most splendid feature of the celebration and one of
the finest spectacles in history.
KITCHENER'S SIDE OP IT.
SO much in the way of criticism has been pro
nounced in this country and in Great Britain
itseif upon the tactics of Lord Kitchener in
South Africa that it is interesting to note a
review of the situation as presented from the stand
point of Kitchener himself. A correspondent of the
Pall Mall Gazette, writing from Pretoria, 1 presents us
with such a view. It shows the encouraging side of
the British campaign and presents what will probably
be the argument of the Ministry when called upon at
the meeting of Parliament to give an account of the
war.
When he assumed command after the retirement of
Lord Roberts Kitchener found all the towns of- the
country safely garrisoned by "British troops, but the
country itself was overrun by. the Boers, who oper
ated in large commandos and were active and dan
gerous throughout the Transvaal and Orange River
Colony. Kitchener's first move was to capture or
break up ,the more formidable of the commandos.
For that purpose large sweeping movements were in
stituted and a vigorous pursuit of the swift-moving
Boers was begun. Those operations, it is said, have
been entirely successful. The Boers have been scat
tered into small bands and are far less dangerous than
they were. That phase of the campaign, therefore, is
declared to have ended in the success of the British
tactiqs.
A new system of tactics was begun where there
were no longer any large commands of the Boers to
fear. For the purpose of dealing with- the scattered
bands the large movements of the British Were aban
doned, and in place of them was substituted the pres
ent tactics of establishing blockhouses at points of.
vantage all over the country. Here, too, it is claimed
success has been attained. The correspondent says:
"Whereas the enemy during November, .1900, inter
rupted the railway line thirty-two times, there has not
been in the last month a single break. At the present
time over 1600 miles of railway are thoroughly
guarded by blockhouses, and it is believed there is
little danger of any serious disturbance of the line
hereafter."
It is further claimed that the effect of the system
has been to convince large numbers of, Boers that
longer resistance is but a useless waste of life. The
correspondent says: "Civil administration is already
firmly established. Among the surrendered and cap
tured burghers a strong pro-British party has been
formed, which, recognizing the hopelessness of the
Boer cause, is determined to do its utmost under the
new government to further the prosperity of the
country. * * * What now remains to be done is
simply to wear down the Boers still in the field by
constantly harassing them."
It is a significant fact that even this sanguine
presentation of the British side of the case does not
venture to predict an early closing of the war. It
seems to be the opinion at Kitchener's headquarters
that all the Boers who will voluntarily surrender have
already come in, and that nothing more in the way of
gain to the British is to be expected from any further
weakening of the Boer forces in that way. The
patriots who are now in the field are described as
"desperate men, who will fight hard before they are
captured." The correspondent says: "In the opinion
of those best able to judge, the end of the war is dis-
tinctly visible, but it is useless to expect it to be fin
ished by any sudden coup.". H
That statement we may accept as the most encourag
ing view of the war the British Ministry can present
to Parliament when it meets. That it will not be ac
cepted as accurate by the opponents of the Ministry
goes without saying. The reports from South Africa
show an activity on the part of the Boers and a will
ingness to take the aggressive and make attacks upon
British outposts which: argue anything rather than
weakness on their side. It is evident they still hope
for victory and independence, and are not fighting
like desperate men who have no other ambition than
that of continuing to fight for the sake of revenge. -
THE PAN-AMERICAN CONGRESS
SO far as immediate results are concerned the
Pan-American Congress may be accounted a
futile meeting. It has given its sanction to
schemes for a Pan : American bank and a Pan-
American railway, neither of which is likely to en
gage the attention of capitalists for many a year to
come. It has indorsed several other plans and pro
posals which, like the railway and the bank, will be
of little practical value just now. Upon the great
and dominant 'issue of the time, that of providing for
a system of international arbitration that would put
a stop to the wars that disturb the southern conti
nent and Central America, it. has not been able to
accomplish anything. The failure in that effort
means virtually the failure of the session as a whole.
By one of those coincidences which unfortunately
are not infrequent in human history, the effort to
establish peace among the nations of South and
Central America has fallen upon a time when their
disagreements are extensive and acute. The situa
tion between Colombia and Venezuela became criti
cal about as soon as the congress was oalled, and
has become more and more threatening ever since.
Lately the controversies between Chile and Argen
tina have reached such a degree of bitterness among
the two peoples that Avar appears almost inevitable.
In Argentina the people have begun assembling in
mass meetings, denouncing further negotiations and
clamoring for war.
The rivalries of the larger States have stirred the
smaller ones. War between Colombia and Venezu
ela would almost certainly involve Ecuador, and a
fight between Argentina and 'Chile would set the
Peruvians marching to regain the territories which
they claim Chile unjustly^ witKholds from them.
Something like a general conflagration of war is
therefore imminent throughout Latin America, and
under such conditions the delegates to the congress
at the City of Mexico have found themselves unable
to do anything of immediate value to the cause of
peace or the promotion of industry and trade.
Fortunately the value of earnest effort in right di
rections-' is not to be measured wholly by imme
diate results. Something has been gained for the
welfare of Latin America by the mere fact of bring
ing their delegates together in a common congress
to discuss measures for mutual good. This congress
is the result of that called by James G. Blaine to
meet in 1889, and from it there will be sure to come
another congress. By degrees the people of the rival
states may learn to look to these congresses with a
confidence which will give them strength to act
firmly. It may be many years before there is formed
in South America a public opinion sufficiently wide
spread and resolute to sustain a joint congress â¢ in
any pronounced programme for the pacification of
the continent, but in the end that much to be desired
sentiment may be formed.
The people of the United States are nut indifferent
to the Pan-American situation. We are aware of the
immense benefits which would accrue to the people
of South America as well as to ourselves by the es
tablishment of peace and the promotion of American
trade. The influence of our Government will there
fore be steadfastly directed toward helping the peace
party. The completion of the interocean canal will
give us a more immediate and direct interest in their
affairs, and consequently augment the value of our
efforts for peace and prosperity. We may look upon
this, congress, then, as but one in a series that is to
be prolonged far into the future. It will not be wholly
fruitless. Bad as is the' outlook now, its- results may
be found good when their value is measured by the
influence they exert in shaping public opinion and
molding it in the direction of general peace and in
dustry.
Since our Government has announced that Germany
may forcibly collect her claims upon Venezuela by
seizing custom-houses and collecting duties but shall
not under any circumstances despoil Venezuela of a
portion of her territory, it might be supposed the
Venezuelans would look upon us as friends, but it
secmsJhcy do not. Reports from Caracas are to the
effect that since the announcement was made the
semi-official papers of Venezuela have quit attacking
Germany and are attacking us for "assuming sov
ereignty over Venezuelan territory." Such is grati
tude. *'
Some anxiety is being felt over an alleged plot of
anarchists to blow up Auburn prison in revenge for
the execution of the slayer of President McKinley.
It is very evident, if the reports be true, that a few
more human rats of the assassin stripe want to die.

THIS FISH, IT IS SAID,
GROWLS AND SNARLS
FRENCH NATURALISTS ARE ENGAGED IN STUDYING A FISH FOUND
IN THE QUEENSLAND RIVERS THAT RESEMBLES THE SALMON,
BREATHES DOUBLY AND MAKES A SNARLING NOISE.
SCIENTISTS are now studying with much interest a very remarkable fish
in the Museum of Natural History in Paris. It is known as the "cerato
dus," or "baramunda," and it is mainly remarkable because until a short
time ago it was suuposed to be extinct.
It is provided with a double means of respiration: in other words, it
breathes through the lungs like most of the bactrachians, and it can also breaths
by means of branchiae, after the manner of an ordinary fish. For a long time
naturalists were doubtful whether animals provided with double sets of respira
tory organs' ought to be classed among fish, but since the discovery of the "cer
atodus" this question has been set at rest, for now it is considered absolutely
certain that animals of this type are genuine fish.
This singular fish is found in Burnett, Dawson and Mary rivers, in Queens
land, being known to the natives there as baramunda and to the colonists as"
the Burnett or Dawson salmon. Its flesh, indeed, looks and tastes like that of
salmon, and hence it is regarded as a. great delicacy.
In size it sometimes attains to six feet in length, though the specimen in the
Paris museuni is less than three feet. Its head is slightly depressed, and In com
parison with its body is rather small; its lower jaw is not prominent; its eyes
are small, and its body is covered with thick -and large .scales. The stomach is
of a- brilliant orange color and its body does not taper off toward me tail quite
as much as is usual in the case of fish.
A French naturalist who has studied the ceratodus says: "The natives of
Queensland declare that this fish frequently raises itself out of the water for the
purpose of obtaining a fresh supply of oxygen, and that it also often makes a
noise like snarling at night. Now, I have carefully watched the specimen in the
Paris museum,' and I can testify that it does raise itself out of the water for the
purpose of breathing. I have not, however, at any time heard it make any
sound resembling growling or snarling, though I have stood near it for several
hours on many a night."
The ceratodus lives mainly on fresh water shellfish, and apparently adapts
itself readily to confinement. The museum authorities in Paris are very proud
of their specimen, not only because the ceratodus has so long been regarded as
extinct but also because in the opinion of competent scientists it is one of the
' first fish that appeared on our globe.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
MARRIED IN SECRETâ A Subscriber.
Portland, Or. Persons who secretly mar
ry have to let the secret out some time or
other. A woman who married in secret
could undoubtedly inherit property left
her by her father, but the fact that she
was married would have to be mads
known when the matter came up for pro
bate,.
CHOSEN FRIENDSâ Subscriber, Wea
verville, Cal. There is no such organiza
tion at this time as the Order of Chosen
Friends, it having gone into the hands of
a receiver on the 13th of December, 1900.
Since then a number 'of the councils of
that once organization have continued
business under the name of the Home
Friends.
CASIXOâ E,, City. In the game of ca
sino should a player^ build up a card to
a certain denomination and his opponent
decline to build It up higher, he, the first
player, may not alter his build, but must
take it with a card of the same denomin
ation. If A holds big casino, nine, five,
and ace, and there is a four on the table
he may build a nine by placing his five
upon the same. If B does not build it
higher, A cannot take his ace and make
it ten, but he must take it with his nine.
RENTING A HOUSEâ Rex.. Callahans,
Siskiyou County, Cal. In renting a house
in a city where there is a supply of water
for the inhabitants the matter of the pay
ment of water rates is a question oi ar
rangement between the landlord and the
prospective tenant. In some cases the
rent is so much, water included, and in
others the rent is so much, the tenant to
pay for the water. If a party buys a lot
he would have a right' to dig a well on
his premises, also to build a cistern.
CONGRESS-W. H. S., Alameda, Cal.,
and W. N. T., Crockett, Cal. The reason
that the present Congress is called the
fifty-seventh is that it is the fifty-seventh
since the first opened, March 4. 17S9. Each.
Congress Is for two years and commences
in the odd years. There may be a number
of sessions of a Congress, if specially
called and such sessions are designated by
their number In the term as for Instance
Fifty-fifth Congress, Fifty-fifth Congress,
second session, and so on, but there must
be a session each year. No trouble need
be feared by any who desires to know the
years covered by a given Congress if the
following simple rule is .observed: Double
the number of the Congress and add the
product to 17S9; the result will be the year
in which the Congress closed. To find
the number of a Congress sitting in any
given year subtract 1789 from, the year;
if the result is an even number half that
number will give the Congress of which
the year in question will be the closing
year; if the result is an odd number add
one to it and half of the result will sive
the Congress of which the year in ques
tion will be the first year.
STAMMERINGâ B., City. Numerous
ways have been devised foi* the cure of
stammering, such as drawUng. singing,
Interpolation or elisions of titters, speak
ing with the teeth closed or with the
tongue pressed to the roof of the mouth,
sniffling, whistling between words, beat
ing time to utterance, stamping the foot,
jerking the body, forks on the tongue,
pebbles in the mouth or tubes fixed be
tween the organs, bands compressing the
larynx and other devices, but they have
not proved satisfactory. The cure is not
within the province of surgery. The hab
it of stammering can be counteracted only
by cultivation of Its opposite habit of cor
rect speaking, and this can be acquired
only by due regard to the process of
speech, the relation of breath to articu
late sounds, the positions of the tongue
and other oral organs In molding the out
ward stream of air, and by patient ap
plication of these principles in slow and
watchful exercises. The lungs constitute
a pair of bellows, and the mouth, In all Its
varying shapes, the nozzle of the bellows.
The passage of the throat must be kept
open. and the breath expelled by means of
ascent of. the diaphragm, not by down
ward, pressure of the throat. All sounds
originate in the throat, and all efforts in
speech must be thrown back behind the
articulating organ?, -which must bo kept
passive, yielding to the air, always open-
Ing to give it exit and never resisting it
by ascent of the tongue or of the jaw
The head must be held firmly on the neck
to give free play to the attached organs
The great principle must never be lost
sight of that speech is breath, and that
while distinctness depends on precision
and sharpness of the oral actions^ fluencv
depends on the unrestrained elusion n f
the material of speechâ the air That we

OLD MONITORS
OUTLIVE THEIR
USEFULNESS
Three old monitorsâ Catskill, Mahopac
and Manhattanâ are to be sdd. They were
built in 1863-64 and have long outlived their
usefulness, as their general "construction,
engines, guns and armor are tbsolete. The
Catskill and Manhattan participated in
several bombardments and engagements,
and carry the scars from Confederate
Brook and Armstrong projectiles, in
â which, however, the Montauk, another
monitor, has the distinction oX having
been hit forty-six times. The Catskill had
its captain, G. W. Rodgers, and assistant
paymaster, "Woodbury. killed in the sec
ond attack on Fort Fisher. August 17.
1S61. The Mahopac was completed too
late to render any service. Since the close
of the Civil "War all the monitors have
been almost constantly tied up at the na
vy yards, a source of expense in the mat
ter of repairs and care-taking, but no se
rious attempt was made to preserve their
usefulness until the recent war with
Spain. New boilers were put in the Ma
hopac and Manhattan, the cost of which,
with overhauling of the old trip-hammer
engines, aggregated over $210,000. It was^
a sheer waste of money, as the speed of
these vessels does not exceed six knots,
and their guns and armor are forty years
behind the times. They will now be sold
for the value of the material less the cost
of breaking up, on which the Navy De
partment may realize one-tenth of tho
money expended since 1898 unles3 the boil
ers are taken out and utilized In other
vessels or shops in navy yards.

Improvements have been made In the
French 'submarine boat Espadon, of the

The Lansquenet, a seagoing torpedo
boat in the French navy, la to be sold for
the price of old metal, after a brief exist
ence of eight years. She was built in
1893, Is of 1CS tons displacement and at
tained a speed of 26 knots with, 2S0O horse
power. The boat has been laid up for a
long time owing to inherent defects in
machinery, and there ara a number of
others in the same fix.

One hundred and thirteen torpedo-boat
destroyers have been built and completed
for the British navy since- 1SD3. They werjej
built by fourteen firms, of which, Lairflp
Brothers constructed 19, Thornycroft and
I Palmer each 16, Thomson 12, Hawthorn
and Falrfleld 9 each, Barrow 8, Doxford 6,
Yarrow 5, Earle 4, Elswick and "White 3
each, Hanna 2 and Thames Iron "Works 1.
Two of the above boats built by Elswick.
namely, the Viper and Cobra, have been
lost. The most successful builders appear
to have been Laird, Thonrycroft, Yarrow
and Palmer, which have built a number
of destroyers for foreign navies with, nni
fonnly good results.
The Bachante, a 12,000-ton armored
cruiser, built at Glasgow for the British
navy, is at this time making: her steam
trials, which consist of the following se
ries: Eight hours' preliminary trial;
thirty hours' coal consumption trial under
one-fifth power: thirty hours* coal con
sumption under four-fifths power, and
closing with eight hours under full power.
The guaranteed speed is twenty-one knots
with 21.000 horsepower for eight hours.
The keel of the Bachante was laid Febru
ary 15, 1SD0. and she is intended to be com
pleted next spring, making the period of
construction about three years.
Torpedo boat No. 108, built by Thorny
croft for the British navy, had her steam
trials November 23 and averaged 23.44G
knots during three hours with 27S0 horse
power. The boat is of ISO tons displace
ment, contract speed 23 knots, and will
cost complete with armament $112,000.
Somewhat similar boats in the United
States navy are the Rowan of. 1S2 tons and
27.071 knots speed, built at Seattle two
years ago at a completed cost of $196,
515 03, and the Nicholson and O'Brien of
174 tons and 2G knots. The two latter were
built by Lewis Nixon at Elizabethport, X.
J., at a contract price of $165,000 each, and
were recently accepted by the Navy De
partment.

The recent discovery of frauds at Se
bastopol were made in a curious way. A
contractor had agreed to furnish coal to
the Black Sea fleet at $7 23 per ton. and in
the hope that the price would fall he al
lowed several months to pass without de
livering any part of his contract. Prices
continued to rise and he -applied to Rear
Admiral Theodosieff of the station for
cancellation of contract and return of hig
deposit, which were refused. Finding
himself in a tight place, he determined to
betray the officials who with him had de
frauded the Government in previous con
tracts. In a letter to Theodosieff he ex
plained prior methods and named, among
others. Staff Captain Gaviloff and the
secretary of the Naval Supplies Depart
ment at Batoun, whom he had bribed. He
then fled the country. The accused offi
cers were tried, convicted and sentenced
to banishment, imprisonment and forfeit
ure of all property and personal and civil
rights.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The first contract for war vessels given
to private builders in Japan was signed
last month, when the Kawasaki Company
at Kobe agreed to build two first-clasa
torpedo-boats for the Japanese navy. The
price is about $200,000, equal to that paid
for similar boats in England and Ger
many, but -with ' thia advantage â that the
money is circulated where it is raised,
home Industry is developed and a costly
and hazardous voyage of 11,000 miles is
made unnecessary for delivery of the ves
sels. â¢
â¢ â¢ â¢
For the first time in the naval history
of Italy has that country turned out all
the machinery necessary for a war vessel
of Italian material and manufacture. The
credit for this achievement is due to An
saldo, Genoa, where the Turkish armored
ship Messoudich has been rejuvenated, re
ceiving new machinery, boilers and arma
ment.

yf As announced In yesterday's paper, the
great closing out sale of nearly 200 choice
high-grade pianos of various makes com-
mences this morning, and If you are inter-
ested in the purchase of a fine piano or
organ within the next two years you -will
have here now the mopt extraordinary op-
portunity to secure a good Instrument at
a tremendous saving in price.
A short time ago, in order to secure our-
selves, we were compelled to accept a
large stock of pianos, consisting of Stein-
way, Emerson, Estey, Starr and other
well-known makes, and in orÂ«1er to dis-
pose of these instruments by the first of
the year we have decided to make a great j
retail slaughter sale of them, including j
also, as a special advertising /eatnre, in
this sale our wholesale stock of strictly
high-grade pianos carried at our sales- j
rooms, G4j Market street, second floor up- j
stairs, in the Bishop building. !
But nine days remain until the end of !
the year, and we reaJize that only the |
most sensational price-cutting will move j
this large stock of nearly two hundred ;
fine pianos within that time. Hut we are j
V determined to close out the entire stock j
* of instruments, and while we regret to j
make such low figures or open ?ut In i
prices as to disturb the immediate future \
of the music trade of this city we feel |
oblitred to make such low prices as will â¢
dispose of every instrument in these ware- '
rooms without delay.
"We have here now and for sale, besides j
. the above mentioned stock of Steinway, |
Emerson. Estey and Richmond pianos, !
the finest assortment of the new scale J
Kimball pianos ever displayed en the j
coast, besides such well-known and strict- [
ly reliable makes as Milton, Whitney, j
Ilinze and other cheaper brands, a hun- I
dred and ninety-six fine new pianos in all. |
TVe have also a number of nev.- odd sam-
ple pianos, of various makes and of any
and all styles. We offer to take for them
the *-xact wholesale or factory cost, which j
means to you at least or nearly one-half |
lower price than these or same grades of
instrument regularly retail for in this or
any other city. ;
The New Scale EQjnts&U Piano is now j
recognized as the leading and greatest â¢
American pianoforte, strictly high grade j
and first class. Steinway pianos are so |
well known in San Francisco as to need j
no further introduction. We offer to-day !
the most beautiful cak-cased seven and
one-third octave strictly high-grade up-
right piano for $218 00, which is almost
v one-half price.
J We offer the largest walnut or mahog-
any cased Schirmer upright pianos for
$117 00â they are considered worth ?250 00
everywhere. Those pianos have thn=e ped-
als. revolving lock board and swinging
music desk, three strings throughout.

Don't miss this sale If the saving of
money is an object. Retail dealers will
tell you that new pianos cannot regu-
larly be sold at such low prices and yield
even a nominal profit to the Beller, and if
that is the case then our loss is your gain.
tAll other investments in the wholesale
J^tock will be slaughtered at correspond-
ingly low figures. This is certainly the
most opportune time to buy a good piano,
and if you are not prepared to pay all
cash down we will arrange time pay-
ments with any responsible buyer.

lancy styles, on which payments must be
at least 5C0 00 down and $20 00 per month,

and $10 00 or $S DO per month, with inter-
est on deferred payments at 8 per cent
per annum.

will accompany each instrument sold,
duly countersigned by us, thus making
these instruments as safe to buy as Gov-
ernment bonds, and if you have any pos-
sible use for a piano come to us, but do
not delay, for at the end of the allotted
nine days these instruments will all be
sold, there will be no moreâ the sale will
positively close.
This sale, as a.bove, will be held at our
wholesale warerooms, the second floor of
the Bishop building, entrance at C45 Mar-
ket street, commencing this (Monday)
morning, and if every one Jn this city
would but realize the exact situation as it

WELCH IS STAR
OF ROAD SHOW
Traveling Aggregation
Opens Season at the
Orpheum.
"Devil's Auction" at the Cali
fornia Delights the
Audience.
The Orpheum road show is not quite tho
splendiferous affair it was last year. But
it's good enough. Joe "Welch is worth
the price. And there are others. There
is a gatling gun drill , that makes the
sparks fly. There is Elizabeth Murray,
who tells a good story and sings a good
song. W. C. Fields is a neat thing In
jugglers, and the rest all contnoute
something worth while. There was a tre
mendous house.
Joe Welch has a German-Jew mono
logue, a sketch from life, and as keen,
'clean and firm In line as one of Phil May's
"gutter snipes." It Is one of the most
genuinely humoroui sketches to be seen
on the variety stige and a model of
method. Weich does not waste a wink or
a word during the whole story, and kills
more birds with one stone than tne aver
age vaudevillian with twenty. He wan
ders in, a meek and melancholy little fig
ure, swamped in his clothes and drowned
in his hat. and tells the adventures of a
small Hebrew tailor in the police court
and iu jail. Not a promising subject, but
as It is told, convulsing. He has one
gestureâ If it can be called suchâ a meek
wink, a gait that cheers and an irresistible |
singsong, and from the time he gently
slouches in to the time he gently slouches
off compels the continuous performance
smile. He has an encyclopedic gift of
slang and a naive and wistful uncon
sciousness that amounts to genius, but
over and above all the machinery of the
turn there is something that grips, and
you don't know how or why, but it does.
The gatling gun drill furnishes the sen
sational epice of the bill and is a breath
less sort of performance by some young
fellows who saw service in the Philip
pines. It is a wonder in its way, and for
acrobatics of the speedy sort beats any
of the gvmnastic turns that vaudeville
exhibits. It is simply the gatling gun
drill, but the swiftness, neatness and dis
patch with which the eight alert young
Americans handle the big gun in its clum
sy carriage Is marvelous. The act Is
picturesquely staged, and a camp scene,
the drill and a surprise by the enemy set
one thinking more than a little of the
men behind the gun.
Elizabeth Murray is a favorite with
some excellent coon songs and some good
stories told cleverly. W. C. Fields Is a
juggler with new tricks, that are amus
ing no end and as clever as they are fun
ny. The Algos trio do some sensational
balancing. Macomber and Engleton do a
fairly good turn and Mclntyre and Heath
give again their clever sketch, "The Geor
gia Minstrels." â¢
There is a large opportunity lost to
"The Serenaders," four pretty young wo
men who really sing very nicely. But
their miniature opera is about as monot
onous as they make them, and what with
the "Beaux and Belles" and the "Floro
dora Sextet" we don't seem to want
' girls to make love to other girls. It's
such a waste. But the Orpheum road
show is worth seeing just the same.

Although the crowd at the California
Theater last night was not large enough
to caupe any inconvenience, those who
attended the performance enjoyed it thor
oughly. "The Devil's Auction" is not a
new play by any means, but in the hands
of the clever people who presented it last
night it has an aspect of newness that ap
peals to the audience.
The piece is as grotesque as ever, and
during the performance many startling
scenic effects are presented. A man. a
dog and a long step-ladder furnish the
most amusement. Between the three a
very clever turn is presented. Fox and
Foxie are the names of the man and the
dog. and both are clever. Amelia Maier
offer dances very cleverly and the terpsi
chorean efforts of the ballet are very
good. Bush and Gordon do an acrobatic
turn that wins great applause and Madge
Torrence. Victoria Walters and Gus Mor
timer are interesting as Carlos, Count
Fortuno and Toby.
Mary Mannering will make her first ap
pearance as a star here to-night at the
Columbia Theater in "Janice Meredith."
It is five years since this charming young
woman was seen here, and she will doubt
less be warmly welcomed by the theater
going contingent during the week. As the
picturesque heroine of Ford's stirring
drama Miss Mannering should have an
opportunity to display all her attractive
capacities. Her supporting company is
said to be rqual to all the emergencies.
The book from which the play has been
made is among the most popular histor
ical novels of the day, and the drama is
said to be a faithful adaptation. H, S.
Northrup and Charles Cherry are among
Miss Mannering's support, and the mount
ings of the play are said to be of the best.
; The play will run two weeks, with special
i matinees on Christmas and New .Year's
j days.

The piece de resistance of the Minnie
Seligman engagement at the Grand Opera
houfe will be put on for the Christmas
week bill â "Carmen." with Miss Seligman
in the title role. The star will be well
supported by the Grand Opera-house
stock company. No expense has been
spared by the management in the staging
and costuming of the piece. An effective
specialty in the famous child dancers.
Rose and Jeannette, will be introduced,
and special matinees will be given on.
; Christmas and New Year's days.
The Tlvoli is to the fore In holiday
shows with "Little Red Riding Hood,"
Ferris Hartman's Christmas extrava
ganza. The piece has "caught on" with
Tivoli patrons, and "the prettiest ever" is
the verdict all round. The fantasy is full
of the fun of the latest minute, with plen
ty of good songs, pretty scenes, pretty
girls and dainty children. Ferris Hart
man, Edward Webb, Harry Cashman and
Annie Meyers supply the fun, and the
pretty girls do the rest. The transforma
tion scene, "Mother Goose's Nursery
Rhymes," comes in for high praise from
the children. All the little folks should
see "Little Red Riding Hood."
"Charley's Aunt" is the Alcazar bill,
and the popular farce should prove an
attractive holiday offering. The Alcazar
stock company has a splendid record for
the "Charley's AUnt" kind of thing. The
farce will doubtless be among their best
efforts as funmakers. The piece is cast
to the full extent of the company. Extra
matinees on Christmas and New Year's
days will afford patrons of the popular
house full opportunity to enjoy its comi
calities.
Heavy melodrama with a Christmas
flavor will reign at the Central Theater
this week with the favorite play "The
Silver King" as the bill. There will also
be a number of good specialties during
the evening. The bill will be one of the
best in town for the price. Matinee on
Christmas day.
Among the entertainers at Fischer's
Concert-house for this week are Williams
and Earl. Irish comedians; Coleman and
Mexls, the wonderful sharpshooters,
whose exhibitions created much Interest
here a short time ago; Lamar and Hall,
clever singing and dancing comedians;
Elizabeth Nella, a renowned whistler, and
Leanora Jenkins, the favorite operatic
soprano, who will sing bits from "The
Geisha." A special matinee will be given
on Christmas.

BILLOWY BOAS AND FLUFFY FEATHERS SET
OFF THE CHARMS OF WINSOME DEBUTANTES
ONE has not lived in vain who saw
Mrs. Thomas Magee Jr. out shop
ping last Saturday in her latest
velvet creation. Mrs. Magee must
have been doing teas the same
day, for she was gorgeously arrayed and t
would have -made a lasting impression
upon "Solomon in all his glory." She
glided in and' out of the shops in that
stately way of hers, wearing such a mar
vel of a gown. It was all black velvet
with the merest touch of white satin.
There was a quiet elegance about it that
pleased you.' The skirt was rather close
fitting and hung in a wreath of folds at
the bottom. At the belt the skirt was
shaped in with tiny white-stitched tucks.
The bodice was of black velvet except
the tiny white satin pipings outlining the
bolero jacket and also set into the fore
arm of the sleeve. A large white hat
completed the toiletâ and a striking affair
it certainly wasâ of white panne velvet
solidly stitched. The hat was quite flat,
the brim being bent slightly down back
and front, and edged with black velvet j
ribbon. On the under side of the brim |
was a single white rose, just visible from
the front. There was a sweet simplicity
about the hat. It had not even the long
ostrich feather which abounds at lunch
eons nowadays.
Speaking of feathers reminds one of
what Mrs. Walter E. Dean said about the
'Topebud garden of girls" for whom she
gave a luncheon in the Palace Hotel con
! servatory last Friday. She observed that
nearly all of the twenty-two debutantes
and their young friends were smiling out
from under great ostrich feathers and
said it was just â¢what completed the
charming picture; that in the billowy
white boas and the long, fluffy feathers
were just the right setting for their girl
ish charms (or something like that). Mra.
Dean has a way of getting those things
off so that you know she means them,
and because she Is such a thoughtful
and serious woman her opinion has
double weight with you.
Everybody knows Mrs. Dean is wise
and sensible, but one cannot stop there,
fdr her rare qualities are ever cropping
out. Perhaps her latest revelation to us
is the wisdom in selecting wintry decora-
THREE MEN ROB
AN AGED WOMAN
Mrs. E. Oels, Who Keeps
a Grocery, the Vic
tim of Thieves.
The little grocery and liquor store which
is kept by Mrs. Oels at 263 Stevenson
street was the scene of an exceedingly
daring robbery last night. Three men en
tered the store about 10 o'clock while Mrs.
Oels, the proprietor, was sitting alone in
the little bar room in the rear of the gro
cery department. While one of the rob
bers choked Airs. Oels to prevent her call
ing for assistance two of the gang ex
tracted about $20 from the till. That the
robbers did not obtain all the money that
was in the store is due to the brave fight
that was made by Mrs. Oels.
In describing- the affair to Officers E<3
Owens and P. Mitchell she said that she
got up from her seat in the bar room on
the entrance of the three men and started
to go behind the liquor counter. Before
she got to the place one of the men seized
her by the throat so that she could not
speak. Deprived of the use of her tongue,
she scraped her feet on the floor In order
to attract the attention of her daughter
and Henry Lemkau, who were in the
house back of the store.
In her struggles with the ruffian who
had her by the throat Mrs. Oels managed
to get to the door which leads to the
house. She was about to turn the knob

MRS. LEN D. OWENS, WHOSE COSTUME ATTRACTED THE ADMIRA
TION OF THE MANY GUESTS AT THE PRESTON-AMES WEDDING
LAST MONDAY, AT WHICH SOCIETY GATHERED.
when the robber withdrew his hands from
her throat and seized hold of a chair as
If to strike her on the head. He was pre
vented from carrying out his intention by
Miss Oels and Henry Lemkau, who at
that moment opened the door leading into
the barroom, having been attracted by
the scuffle between Mrs. Oels and the
robber. ' ,
At the entrance of Lemkau and the
daughter the robbers fled, leaving part of
the money in the till. They ran up Ste
venson Btreet in the direction of Fourth
and Lemkau gave chase. On reaching
Fourth street they turned down and are
said to have boarded .a Mission-street car.
The robbery had evidently been care
fully planned. Mrs. Oels is positive that
three of the four robbers came into her
store on the previous evening. But, as on
that occasion there were several custom
ers in the store, the men did nothing to
arouse suspicion. Mrs. Oels is certain
that she can identify one of the gang. In
describing him to the police she said that
he Is quite tall, smooth-shaven and has a
large mouth. He wore a dark suit of
clothes and a tie striped with yellow.
Almost within the shadow of the Hall
of Justice J. Kutaka, a Japanese, living at
423 Stevenson street, was held up by two
men shortly before 3 o'clock yesterday
morning and robbed of $3, all the money
he had. According to his story, he was
â walking through Portsmouth square on
his way home when the robbers approach
ed him, and while one gave him the
"strong arm" the other searched hlg
pockets, taking his money. The Japanese,
after the thieves released him, hurried to
police headquarters, where he reported the
robbery. , '
Police Officer George F. Barry, whose
methods have on more than one occasion
caused him to be reprimanded by his
superior officers, was sent to find the rob
bers, and, meeting several respectable
citizens, he attempted to cast suspicion on
them. Realizing his blunder, he tried to
explain by saying that Sergeant Donovan
had told him to hold up everybody he met
in the hope that he might obtain- a clew
to the robbers.
The Song of Birds.
M. Coupin writeg on the subject of bird
song, giving many interesting examples
of Imitation. Very remarkable is the in
stance of a sparrow imitating the strldu
lation of a grasshopper; one spring the
sparrow's cage was hung near another
cage containing several grasshoppers. No
notice, was taken by the sparrow for a
whole' year, but during the next year he
learned to imitate the grasshopper's notes
and never forgot them during his life,
often combining them with the songs of
birds, however. Young linnets sometimes
learn the notes of the nightingale. Cer
tain birds in Thuringia sing much better
than others of their own species in the
Hartz mountains, it is said, and the su
perior excellence due to local conditions
always persists.
tions for her debutante luncheon. The
conservatory was a typical winter scene
and the gaunt, leafless tree covered with
snow in the center of the table offered a
striking contrast to the warm, bright
freshness of the young girls who have
not yet ever seen the storms of life, much
less endured them.
There were such Interesting favors at
each guest's plate. Little pine trees for
the guests at one table and red poinsetta
in bloom for the debutantes. Each little
jar was daintily draped in soft red silk.
And to see those happy, feathery debu
\ tantes trudging homeward, each clinging
; to a little potted plant with girlish de
light, was truly refreshing.
Mrs. Dean wore a dainty gown of white
.moire silk with narrow pink satin stripes.
Panels of the skirt were set together with
insertion of white embroidered chiffon ap
plique, also a ruffle of the chiffon at the
bottom of the skirt. The bodice had a
bertha of the same embroidered chiffon
and a vest of the same embroidered in old
spangles. Tiny rows of black velvet baby
ribbon were also used for trimming.
The white lace hat Mrs. L. D. Owen
wore at the Ames-Preston wedding was
much admired. The crown was a flat
puff of white Cluny lace and the brim of
shirred tulle. On the left side was a long
heavy ostrich feather, held in place by a
rhinestone buckle. At the back was a ro
sette of white moire ribbon. Mrs. Owen's
gown was white duchess satin with a deep
Spanish flounce of accordion-plaited chif
fon, the- top edge being outlined with
Cluny lace insertion. Similar lace also
trimmed the chiffon bodice and finished
the elbow sleeves. She looked as chic as
the bride herself.
Everybody is asking everybody else If
they have been asked to the Spreckels
ball on New Year's eve for Misses Lil
lian and Grace Spreckels. although no for
mal invitations have been sent out. There
will probably be 200 guests, but all are
to be invited personally by the proper
member of that household, so there won't
be the slightest excuse for one thinking
it is a formal affair.
The eagerness manifested for invita
tions is not surprising. The Spreckel3
girls are such decided favorites wherever
they go and everybody knows they can
entertain to the queen's taste.
BIRTH OF CHRIST
IS THEIR THEME
Special Sermons and
Songs in Houses of
Worship.
Church organs pealed forth yesterday
in grand solemnity and sacred choirs lift
ed their voices in prefatory glorification
of the day of Christ's birth. Special
hymnal and devotional services were held
in nearly all the churches. With prayer
and song the first of the Christmas week
ceremonies received a most reverential
expression.
Great numbers worshiped at the altars
of the Catholic and Protestant churches
yesterday morning. Special sermons
preached by the shepherds of the flock
told of the glory of Christ's life, his mis
sion on earth and the great lesson he has
taught humanity through generation after
generation. In some of the houses of God
the humble surroundings of the Savior'3
birth were made the theme for pulpit,
eloquence. The seal of divinity furnished
the subject matter of other addresses.
Precepts of religion, of piety, of reverence
of the true Christianity all found a. place
in the sermons of God's ministers.
The old traditional and distinctive
Christmas carols gave the choirs an op
portunity for vocal differentiation. From
hymn to carol the church singers
breathed the spirit of Christ into the ser
vices. The sermons of the ministers ex
emplified what the choirs expressed in
song.

Errors.
"Jake" Beckley in Eclipse as
Assistant to the
Umpire.
The Nationals defeated the San Fran
ciscos yesterday at baseball at Recreation
Park by a score of 2 to 0. The home play
ers divided their time between playing
brilliant ball at critical points of the
game and then aiding the Eastern men
score by making costly errors. Three
times in the first five innings the Na
tionals had a man on third, but were un
able to send him home owing to clever
fielding.
Beckley proved so successful on Satur
day in assisting McDonald umpire the
game that he tried the same tactics in the
rirtt inning. Hildebrand bit to third and
forced Wilson out at second. The ball
was sent to lirst to head off "Hilde," but
arrived too late. Beckley said "three out"
and left the field. McDonald called Hilde
brand "safe" and Beckley was in eclipse
for the time beinc as an assistant to the
umpire. He tried the trick again in the
sixth and it did not work. Beckley had a
heated argument with McDonald over the
decision, ana for a time a fight seemed
imminent.
McDonald was severe on Iburg in the
matter of balls and strikes, the spectators
differing with him repeatedly in this par
ticular.
The first run was made in the sixth inn
ing. After two men were out Beckley sin
gled. Steinfeldt. the next man up, sent
the ball out to deep right field for a two
bagger. Beckley just beat it home by a
shade. Steinfeldt was caught stealing
third.
The second and last run was scored in
the- eighth. Mertes was safe on Josh
Reilly's fumble. Chance was hit by
pitcher. Lee singled, filling: the bases.
Beckley hit to pitcher, forcing Mertes out
at the plate. Steinfeldt hit to Rellly, who
again fumbled the ball and Chance scored.
McHale flew, retiring the side with the
bases full. The score:

with a snap and vim that won him his
trials in short order. In reaching tHte final
Wedgewood had been forced to but 56

ponent in tne deciding course, was in fine
lettle, and his clever work throughout the

George Nethercott's young greyhound
Red Rock won the open stake final with

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, .DECEMBER 23, 1901.
HIGH CLASS FORM IS DEVELOPED
II IN PRELIMINARY ROUNDS OF PLAY
Matches Attract the Largest Number of Competitors of
Any Meeting During the Season, While Spectators
Crowd Every Point From Which Game May Be Seen
THE Christmas class singles tennis
tournament, commenced yester
day at the California Club courts,
attracted the largest number of
players and spectators of the win
ter season. Thirty-three of the best play
ers from both sides of the bay took part,
and some exceptionally fine tennis re
sulted.
Grant Smith played the best game In
the first class, in which he and W. B.
Collier are left for the finals. Smith gave
Merle Johnson a drubbing-, beating him
6-0, 6-1.
Collier drew C. Dunlap, the park cham
pion, and beat him rather easily, 6â3, 6â2.
Dunlap was handicapped somewhat by.
the asphalt court, but he was rather out
classed by his opponent. Collier also won
from Fred Brown, the University of Cali
fornia crack. Brown took the first set.
and was within a point of the match in
the second set, but Collier, who is never
beaten until the last point ; has been
played, hung on and won the set. Brown
was discouraged after losing the second
set and Collier took the last by a score
of 6-0.
Dick Adams disposed of Harry Routh,
the second best player in the park. The
score was 6 â 1, 6 â 4. Adams next played
Dummond McGavin, and a good match
resulted. With the score standing set all,
McGavin went in and played some re
markable tennis, winning the deciding
set, 6â3. After his match with Adams
many thought McGavin would win the
first class honors, but in his match with
Smith the latter had him. well in hand
all the way and won easily.
In the second class William Frost beat
Ray Cornell, one of the best men In his
class, easily, the score being 6 â 0. 6-^-3.
Frank Stringham and Homer Parker
reached the semi-finals In the upper half
and Cbet Smith arTd Frost in the lower
half of the card. After Parker and String
ham had each won a set the latter de
faulted, as he would not be able to play
on Christmas. With the score standing
set all, the match between Smith and
Frost was called on account of darkness.
R. D. Walker, Harry Young and H.
Webster, three park players, were in this
class, but were put out in the first round.
Walker made an excellent showing
against Parker and nearly defeated him.
In the third class it appeared Charles
Kuehn would again win, but he went
down to defeat in the finals. Herbert
Schmidt beat Kuehn In straight sets in
the finals. _ . â 
The fourth class players were all evenly
matched and the games were close. L-. E
Wood and Al Kenyon will play In the
finals on Christmas. In the semi-finals
Wood and R, S. Stubbs figured in the
most stubbornly contested match of the
day. Stubbs took the first set, 13â11, but
his efforts tired him and Wood won thÂ«
next two sets handily.
Following is the detailed score of the
tournament:
Championship class â R. N. and G. F. Whit
ney, match to be played Christmas morning.
First class, preliminary roundâ S. H. Alams
beat Harry Routh, 0-1, 6-4. First round-

DRUMMOND MacGAVIN, ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA TENNIS CLUB'S
CRACK PLAYERS, GOES AFTER A HIGH ONE IN A CHRISTMAS
TOURNAMENT GAME PLAYED YESTERDAY ON CLUB COURTS.
SOCIETY ADOPTS
SPORT VASCO
Exciting Game Is Taken
Up by Prominent
Clubmen.
Vasco pelota, the Spanish ball game
that is played within three walls at
Central Park, has caught the fancy of
athletic society. Society would not go to
vasco, so vasco walked off the court
and went to society. The compliment was
returned, and now the young clubmen of
San Francisco have come out and said
to themselves and their world, "We will
play vaBco."
This same has the elements of many
American games woven Into one, with a
papoose basket flavor that gives it its
distinguished characteristic. It calls for
skill, alertness, agility and endurance. All
these qualities were brought into play
yesterday, when the clubmen of San
Francisco crowded -the boxes and tiers in
the stands overlooking the courts.
In the first place, the management
sprinkled tickets over' the Olympic and
Bohemian clubs and the spectators' list
was consequently a long one. Vasco was
heard of before, but never seen, and now
that the introduction has been official and
gratuitously given arid thankfully re
ceived the sport will certainly create com
ment, If not a greater patronage. The
famous Olympic handball stars, who have
almost forsworn allegiance to their own
country in their admiration of the Irish
game, crowded the benches. They let
their enthusiasm have full sway, and
when the games were finished they all
walked downtown j and took . enchiladas
with their drinks. Among the Olympians
there Is some talk of organizing a team
to learn the game and represent the club
in Mexican tournaments. . Already some
of the active members are searching the
Spanish dictionaries for idiomatic terms
that will represent-such critical judg
ments as "no fault," "terrible," "lobster"
and the rest of the Olympic handball pa
tois.
What the Olympic Club men have con
templated for a future action the unlver-

BURN TO DEATH
IN THEIR HOME
Four Persons Lose Their
Lives and Another
( May Die.
DUBOIS, Pa., Dec. 22.â Near Summer
ville yesterday the home of John Ash
baugh, a farmer, was destroyed by fire
and four persons were burned to death.
One other is burned in such a manner
that recovery is doubtful and four others
are seriously burned and Injured. T_he
dead: . : - - â  â 
WILLIAM ASHBAUGH, 22 years old, a
brother of the owner of the Ashbaugh
home.
MAYBEL ASHBAUGH, aged 12.
HARRY ASHBAUGH, aged 10.
JAMES ASHBAUGH, aged 9.
The injured: Herman Ashbaugh, burned
seriously, leg broken and Injured internal
ly; John Ashbaugh, the husband and fath
er, burned seriously and suffering from
exposure; two young children, painfully
burned. :
The affair happened at an early hour
In the morning. The fire was probably
caused by an overheated stove.
sity men have taken up in earnest. Tom
and Will Magee, famous In a small way
on the handball and tennis courts; Will
Crocker, Charles L. Fair, Dr. Harry and
Will Tevis, S. Chase, Dick and Joe Tobin
are all pupils of the vasco teachers.
These men are enthusiasts, and some day
shortly they will entertain society with
exhibitions of their skill and prowess on
the Eder Jal court. The Magees and the
Toblns and the Tevlses will have family
feuds over the sport, and polo will then
find a rival in vasco. Young America has
gone to Spain.

In "Herpicide," the New Scientific ar.d
Successful Dandruff Treatment.
Have* you dandruff? Then you have a
contagious parasite disease, unpleasant,
unhealthy and one that will eventually
lead to baldness. To cure It you must
destroy the parasite that eats at the root
of the hair. The only preparation for
destroying these genns Is Newbro's Her-
picide. Charles Klein of Laramie, "Wyo.,
says: "Herpicide allayed the Itching,
cured the dandruff and stopped my hair's
falling out; and it is bringing a new crop
of half." Herpicide is free from grease
or dangerous drugs, and makes hair glos-
sy and soft as silk. One bottle will con-
vince you of its merits.

FIGHTS ROBBERS
WITH HIS FISTS
Berkeley Student Bests
Masked Men in Mid
night Fray.
BERKELEY, Dec. 22.â Two hold-ups oc
curred In this city last night. In the first
Edward Fisher of 1525 Arch street was
stopped by three persons, two of whom
appeared to be mere boys, and at the point
of three weapons Fisher was relieved of
his money and watch. In the second hold
up a fight ensued, in which L. F. Over
street, a student in the local Commercial
College, came out the victor over two
thugs. Overstreet was badly used up in
the struggle, being struck a heavy blow
on the back of the head.
The attempt to rob Overstreet occurred
at 11:45 o'clock. He was returning from
Oakland to his home at 1S01 Milvia street,
â when, at the corner of Berkeley way and
Henry street, two masked men jumped ln
front of him from the shadow of the
hedge which runs along Henry street.
Without a word one of them struck at the
back of Overstreet's head with a Ion?
club. Overstreet ducked and stopped the
force of the blow with his right shoul
der. This saved him from being stunned.
Overstreet leaped by the footpad with
the bludgeon and grappled with the sec
ond robber. Before either robber real
ized what was happening one of them
was sprawling in the gutter from two
well-directed blows in the face. As he
turned upon the other highwayman Over
street caught the full force of a blow
from the club across his knuckles, which
badly bruised them.
Tackles His Assailant.
Overstreet grasped the weapon and
rrappled with his assailant. They fought
*baok and forth across the Pidewalk and
against the hedge, the footpad striking
Overstreet with the butt of a revolver he
drew after losing the club.
The highwayman who had been knocked
into the gutter cither had enough expe
rience for one night or heard some one
coming, for he ran up Henry etreet as
spon as h*Â» regained his feet, whistling for
hiÂ» comrade. The latter broke loose from
Overstreet, leaving his club in the stu
dr.nfs hands, and ran rapidly after his
partner.
Overstreet did not follow the men but
went immediately to his home. He de
scribes his assailants as the usual tall
and short man. The tall one carried the
club, which was two feet and a half of
a spade handle, and wore a dark suit and
| slouch hat. The short man wore a gray

YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS RE
TURNED FROM POST IN HOS
PITAL SERVICE AT MANILA. â¢ .
hospital department in the Philippines
Miss Ridlev said:
There has been a great change for the better
in the sanitary conditions of the city of Ma
nila sinre I nist went there nearly three years
ago. The American â  military and civil au
thorities have inaugurated many modern im
provements along lines that are highly con
ducive to making the city a healthier place for
native and foreisrn residents alike. In thÂ«>
First Reserve Hospital in Manila, the head
quarters of the army service, patients are ac
corded all the con%"enlences and high-class
treatment that are characteristic of the best
hospitals in the United States.
On my first arrival in Manila there mete
about 1700 soMiers in the local hospital. When
I left there we had something- over 100 pa
tients in the wards. Most of these were suf
fering from the dysentery peculiar to the
islands. Forty nurses are at present on the
staff of the First Reserve Hospital.
Although there has been no heavy fighting
done in ths Philippines for some time, ou*"
soldiers are kept busy hunting down bands of
marauding natives. In the province of Panay
the bolomen. who use long and curved knives
as their weapons of â¢warfare, cause consider
able trouble. They have an annoyinjr and
â  unique way of giving battle, and because they
wear few or no clothes, often have our soldiers
at a disadvantage. The bolomen will, as a
rule, make their stand in a swamp or very
muddy section of country. When they are
getting the worst of the fight they beat a re
â¢*reat through the mud or marsh,- and being
almost naked, plow and slide along faster than
bur soldiers attired ln ordinary clothes can. It
Is r.ext to impossible to overtake such war
riors when they fight that way.
It may at first seem strange, but I believe
that many of the petty uprisings our troops
have to deal with are indirectly due to locusts.
Often when the crops of the natives are nearly
ripe' immeriRe clouds of these destructive In
sects will sweep across portions of the country
and denude them of every Browing thing. Such
catastrophes moan great loss to the natives
of the particular place affected, and the gren
eral sequel Is that they set out to steal from
and kill others. As a consequence expeditions
of trooDS have to be detailed constantly to
round up and subdue the warlike raiders.
suit and black slouch hat. Both wore
white masks made of handkerchiefs with
holes cut for the eyes.
Fisher was held up at the corner of
Vine and Spruce streets in North Berke
ley. He had returned from San Francisco
on the train which arrives at Berryman
station at 10:05 o'clock and was crossing
over the intersection of Vine and Spruce
streets when sorn^ one from behind com
manded, "Stop, partner, and hold up your
hands."
Robber Carried a Carbine.
Fisher stopped, and on turning saw
three men approach each covering him
with a weapon. One carried an old army
carbine and the other two covered Fisher
with 45-callber revolvers such as were
used in the civil war.
The taller of the three,' who appeared
to be the ringleader, was apparently about
23 years of age, while the others were not
over 17. None of them wore a mask but
all had their faces partly covered by
blouch hats drawn down over their eyes
Fisher lost $4 in coin and a gold watch
and chain. He asked for the return of
his watch. One of the robbers started to
hand it back to him, but the leader re
fused to let it go. An electric car ap
proached and Fisher was forced into the
shadow of a fence and tree until It passea
not twenty feet from him. As soon as the
car got by the youthful highwaymen
started Fisher down Spruce street, going
themselves toward the hills.
Deputy Marshal Alden was on the scene
shortly afterward, but no trace of the
robbers could be found. He thinks they
are from San Francisco. Fisher thinks
he could identify them if captured.

ACCEPT CHRIST
AS THEIR GUIDE
Two Hundred Children
Are Confirmed at
St. Brigid's.
Archbishop Riordan Delivers
Stirring Address to
Young P oik.
Two hundred boys and girls, composing
the classes or 1901 of St. Brigid's parish,
were cpnUrmed with impressive ceremo
nials in St. Brigid's Church by Arch
bishop Riordan yesterday afternoon. The
sacred edifice was thronged by relatives
and friends ol* the little ones.
The service began at 4 o'clock, when the
children inarched into the auditorium. The
girls were arrayed in white and each wore
a > veil. The boys each wore on the left
arm a white knotted ribbon. At the altar
were gathered Archbishop Riordan, Very
Rev. J. J. .Prendergast, Vicar Uenerai;
Father John E. Cottle, yastor of St.
lirigid's; b auier J. McGinty of Holy
Cross, father Martin -Ryan oÂ£ St." Vincent
de Paul, Father M. Connolly of St. Paul's,
Father J. Coyie or the Star of the Sea and
Father P. O'Kyan of the League of the
Cross.
The rites of confirmation were perform
ed by the Archbishop, and at the close of
the ceremonial he delivered an address in
which he said:
This is a solemn moment in the lives of
these children, and they will realize this as
they grow older. It is a ceremony which binds
us to the past, for to-day these .children have
become soldiers of Christ. To-day' they enter
upon the warfare against sin which must last
until their dying day.- There is need of vigil
ance always. We must ever be on our guard
and never forget that we are soldiers of Cnrlst.
One moment of iortcetfulness and the enemy
takes possession of our hearts. The other day
an engineer torgot his ordeis for a single mo
ment . and the result was the loss of several
lives. Kemember, children, that you are sol
diers of the Lord* Keep your sniritual eyes
open, and beint; able . to see the enemy, you
will be able to guard against him always.
Let these children prove worthy of this great
occasion.- In Roman history we read that it
was the custom of children to wear a medal
which always â  reminded them of their ances
tors' and that they should never disgrace their
forefathers.- â  But what Roman emperor or
prince ever equaled our great master? How
much more sacred are our oblisations not to
disgrace him. What a wonderful privilege it
is to boast of belongine not to this or that
country, but to the kingdom of God. Parents,
bring up your little ones in a manner worthy
a hiirh calllnc. The road to salvation is not
one lined with flowers, but under a heavy cross
must we- work out our own salvation. This
way to heaven, good Ufa and virtue is a way
of sacrifice. We are followers of the cruci
fied Savior, and the way of eternal life is the
way of the cress. Teach them to be proud of
their rellclcn; teach them that there is but
one church and that they must know its duties
and obligations. Think of Christ in the man
ger and all he has done for us. May the Bplrit
of the Christmastide be a spirit of peace to
you all forevermore. I wish you all a merry
Christmas! ,'.
The boys were then pledged to refrain
from drinking liquor and frequenting sa
loons until they were 21. The oath was
administered by the Archbishop, who
said that sobriety in the young was great
ly to be commended. This concluded the
services.

II. RYAN DISCUSSES
CHINESE QUESTION
Expresses Fear That Mongolians Will
Overrun World Some Day With
Their Manufactories.
If the audience that went to hear H.
Ryan lecture at tne Metropolitan Hall
last evening was small ln number's, at
any rate what there was of it completely
filled every bit of breathing' space with
enthusiasm. Ryan's' subject was a popu
lar one and Ryan_ls a ready and able
young man and possesses the rare fac
ulty of being interesting. .
"Chinese Immigration" was the topic
and the lecturer divided his attention be
tween the admission of, Clunese to these
shores and the fact of their advancement
as mechanics and masters of industry in
their own land. While strongly favoring
exclusion, ho pointed out that what the
world had most to fear was that one day
the Chinese would flood the markets of
the world, not from the United States;
but from their own manufactories on their
own soil.
In speaking of England controlling a
great part of China,- the lecturer was un
fortunately misunderstood by some one
in the body of the hall, who cried out:
"You're a liar! England has no Chinese.
There isn't a Chinaman there." The iu
teruption was loud enough and fierce
enough to alarm some in the audience,
but'the real words uttered by Ryan hav
ing been explained, the Interrupter sat
himself down in peace and the lecturer
composedly continued his discourse.
Rhetorician for Summer School.
BERKELEY, Dec. 22.-Professor Fred
Newton Scott, the noted rhetorician, has
been added to the faculty of the summer
session of the University of California for

logical journals and among his published
works are "Aestheticsâ Its Problems and
Literature." "Principles of Style," "Com
position-Rhetoric," etc.. Professor Scott
graduated from the University of Michi
gan in 1884 and received the degree of
Ph.D." from his alma mater in 1889.

The directors of the Deaf and Dumb
and Blind Institute at Berkeley have de
cided to build a very necessary hospital
for the institution without waiting for an
appropriation from the State Legislature.
They have, they believe, sufficient money
for the purpose in the* various funds un
der their control, and will leave the ques
tion of reimbursement to the next Legis-
Plans have been perfected, contracts let
and the work of breaking ground is in
Pr The e ho'spltal will cost about $10,000. Dr.
O. D. Hamlin of the Oakland Board of
Health and Architect Walter Matthews
prepared the plans and specifications now
approved by the directors. Advantage has
been taken of the experience gained in
similar institutions in the East, and the
new hospital will be equipped with all the
appliances modern science can suggest as

"Wise Men As Types of Earnest Seek
ers After Truth" was the topic of Frank
Kline Baker, pastor of the First M. E.
Church last evening. He said ln part:
That they were earnest seekers Is seen; ln
their preparation of heart to receive the truth;
in their readings to follow the light already
elven; in their willingness' to make any sacri
fice to find. the new-born. king; ln their faith â â 
they expected to find him and they went pre
pared to worship him; In that they were not
easily turned aside by other things; in that
they were ready and willing to obey God after
they found the object of their search. These
wise men teach us:- .
That God measures things not as man lneaa-

A few of the older guests also con

The programme was printed on dainty
cards decorated with forget-me-nots. At
the close of the entertainment the chil
dren were ushered into the large dining
hall on the first floor, where the table
glowed with its decorations of Christmas
colors and trinkets. The little hostess
presided at the head of the table, where
nine pink candles burned in the birthday
cake. The children present were:

ures them. The most common and Insignificant
in the material world may be the medium of
the morally great.
That God's way Is not man's and yet God's
way is better than man's, and God's wisdom
and power are greater than all the secrecy and
diplomacy and might of kings.
That the more highly privileged sometimes
see less and appreciate less than those who
are the least . privileged.
The star stood over Bethlehem and the heads
of the Jews, but they saw It not. It is so
with the Gospel privileges to-day.
That the earnest seeker of the truth shall
find. All human hearts seek rest and they find
it only as they find him who Is "the way. the
truth and the life."
The congregation was large and the
programme of music excellent.

MARKET STREET
IS A RIVER BED
Fantastic Cleaning Done
by Board of Pub
lic Works.
City's Main Thoroughfare Is
Made a Menaca to
/ the Public.
Hesing the asphalt of Market street dn
the Sabbath morning is one of the latest
manifestations of the Board of Public
Works' peculiar and fanciful activities.
Hosing, not cleaning, is the board's
motto.
That part of the San Francisco public
that found occasion to cross Market street
yesterday morning was lost in wonder- '
ment. Looking at the sky, they found it
cloudless and without a lingering trace of
"nature's lofty rain stores." Underneatli
their feet were puddles full of slush. The
question on every tongue was: '"When
did this mighty rain fall?"
Pedestrians who endangered their bodies
by crossing in the siimy filth that was left
after the street cleaners had performed
their labors, and riders and drivers who
risked not only their own persons, but
their horses, were- at a loss to explain thiÂ»
new fantastic menace on the city's main
thoroughfare. Market street had the ap
pearance of a river bed whose waters had
been suddenly drained. The sediment of
refuse and mud manufactured by the or
der of the Board of Prablic Works was
like the track of a great inundation.
Rarely has a tempestuous rainstorm
torn up Market street in this fashion.
Sometimes when the city has been drench
ed for' several successive days with a
steady downpour there has been an ap
proximate accumulation of water on the
street, but where all the mud and slush
of yesterday morning was found is more
than even the expert could tell. By scour
ing and scraping the laborers worked the
thick paste to the gutters and there they
left it as an offense to eye and nose. Un
less a heavy rain Â«coraes to drive It Into
the sewers there it is likely to remain.
Only in winter does the Board of Public
Works disolay this, anomalous energy.
When the summer winds blow sheets of '
sand and dust down the streets the hy
drants are sealed tight and fast. It needs
the Board of Public Works to produce a
river bed full of slime with Market st/eet â¢
as the raw material.
A rainstorm cleanses the street. Tha
storm that the Board of Public Works
stirred up was to gather the material for
a slimy coating, treacherous to locomo
tion, and heaping of unseemly piles of
thick mud in the gutters.
"Father," said the young son of the
eminent medical and scientific authority,
"if all the diseases come from perm3, as
you say they do. what good do germs
"do? Wasn't it a mistake to create them?"
"Whyâ erâ germs, Lionel." replied his
paternal ancestor, "may be said to serv*
X\i e â erâ purpose ofâ you are rather younr:,
however, to understand such things fully,
but I may. mention that I am to write an
article on that subject next rtlonth for
one of the magazines, for which they pay
me $500."â Chicago Tribune.

A Girl's Apt Essay on Boys.
"The boy is not an animal, yot they can
be heard to a considerable distance.
When a boy hollers he opens his bier
mouth like frogs, but girls hold their
tongue till they are spoken to, and they
answer respectable and tell just how it
was. A boy thinks himself clever because
he can wade where the water is deep.
When a boy grows up he is called a hus
band and he stops wadingr and stays out
at nights, but the grown-up girl Is a
widow ar.d keeps house."

days; Eva Montgomery, 70 days, and the
lmberhorn, 81 days. Not one of tho fleet
had anything out of the ordinary to re
port.
Among the other arrivals was the Cas
sard, 151 day3 from Swansea; the overdue
Narcissus, 191 days from Genoa; the
Mauna Ala, 19 days, and the Mohican 21
days from Honolulu, while the Kennebec
and half a dozen others were outside at
sundown.
The Narcissus was considered overdue,
and the underwriters were paying the
gamblers a good rate when she showed up
off the heads. The Kennebec was on her
way from Acapulco for Puget Sound, but
probably puts in here for orders as she
has recently been purchased by George
E. Plummer. Both vessels have only
light winds and calms to report. . â¢

Vessel Dolphin Arrives From
North Destitute of
News.
PORT TOWNSEND., Wash., Dec. 22.â
The steamer Dolphin which arrived from
tho north to-day brought no tidings of
the United States mail steamer Discovery,
which sailed from Juneau early in No
vember for Dutch Harbor and was sighted
by the steamer Elk on November 14 at
AVood Island. Since that time nothing
has been seen nor heard of her. She
having failed to reach her destination, the
steamer Elihu Thomson was dispatched
by the company owning, the Discovery
with mail and freight, and also to look
for the jnlssing steamer, but according
to reports the Thomson returned'on De
cember 10 without having seen anything
of the missing vessel.
Shipping men as well as friends and
relatives of the crew have about given
up all hope for the safety of the steamer
and those on board. Shortly after the
Discovery sailed from Juneau in Novem
ber a storm came up and during the
month a tierce gale swept the coast from
Sltka to the group of islands and the
steamer consumed considerable time in
reaching Wood Island.
The Discovery was in command of Cap
tain Frank M. White, who lost the steam
ship La Arado two years ago near Nome,
and Captain J. E. Lennan, an experienced
Alaska navigator was pilot. When she
sailed for Dutch Harbor she had three or
four passengers. Other members of the
crew were: Thomas Pyle, mate; William
Teaka, second mate; Charles Sprague,
purser; Patrick Gard, chie f engineer;
Thomas Foley, first assistant engineer;
C. Conway and T. Amoth, firemen;
Charles Eman, coalpasser; E. H-. Gaskell,
B. G. Hines and W. J. Price, seamen; W.
L Kennedy and William L. Charboneau,
wipers, and two Chinese cooks. The Dis
covery was fomerly a towboat on Puget
Sound.

LONDON MARKET
GROWS STRONGER
Promoters of fining Se
curities Are Nourish
ing a Boom.
Berlin Dealers Are Closing
Their Engagements Before
Holidays.
LONDON, Dec. 22.â The stock market
generally was more cheerful during: the
last week chiefly owing to the growing
belief here and on the Continent that the
war In South Africa is winding up at
last. Speculators drew additional en
couragement from the better outlook In
the United States, the revival of confi
dence In Franco and the belief that the
worst of the German crisis Is past.
The railway outlook for the coming
year is not' very promising. Competent
critics declare that the railways are
steadily ruining rural England by their
excessive agricultural freight rates. This
same policy, it is pointed out, is largely
responsible for the depression In Englisn
industrial centers. "
For the present, however, the Stock Ex
change is enjoying the year end revival
to the utmost. Promoters of mining se
curities are carefully nourishing a boom,
but it is said that a .considerable under
current of realizing by outsiders for fear
of some sudden reverse In South Africa,
may check the winter rise.
The closing money market of the year
Is not without serious inconvenience. The
market is unable to shake Itself clear of
the Bank of England. It borrowed Â£o00,
000 last week and will probably take
jÂ£4O0,0O0 this week. It Is true that large
Government disbursements, 'of supply and
interest, after January 1, will release
large sums; but in view of the. depleted
bank reserve the bank will probably take
mea'sures to attract gold from New York
and Paris, thus endangering the prospect
of cheap money throughout the . coming
year.
BERLIN, Dec. 22.â The Boerse has al
ready begun to assume its holiday aspect,
dealers being inclined to close their en
gagements before the holidays. The vol
ume of business during the last week,
excepting transactions in Government
funds, was extremely light.
The public shows a strong disinclination
for all speculative -securities, but an in
creased appetite, however, for fixed in
terest-bearers, in which during the week
there were large transactions. The flota
tion of several municipal loans also re
vealed enormous demands, while the issue
of a number of loans after the new year
animates this department and gives
strength to bank shares.
Much interest has been shown hefe In
the forthcoming Vienna loan fort the
munlcipalization of the street rallroaas of
Vienna which has just been announced.
The Deutsche Bank and other banks have
taken allotments in this Vienna loan
amounting to 285,000,000 crowns. It has also
been announced that the German Govern
ment is negotiating a loan for 100,000,000
marks for next March, with the option
1 of increasing this amount.
Foreign railroads showed active trad
ing during the last week, the Transvaal
railroad leading. Germans have lately
been buying American railroad shares in
London in large amounts. .

All old people's muscles get weak and. flabby, and it's the same
j with the muscular walls of their intestines as with the muscles of their
arms. When the bowels grow weak, the old folks get constipated,
bilious, sick, helpless, irritable, and that's the chief cause of their
death. Old folks should take Cascarets Candy Cathartic-bowel tonic,
keep their liver lively, their bowels regular and strong and live to bo

RUNAWAY ROLLS
OVER A BLUFF
Mrs. William Inch Leaps
From Buggy to Save
Herself.
People on Beach Startled by
a Spectacular Ac
cident
The hundreds of people who thronged
the beach in the vicinity of the Cliff
House yesterday afternoon were startled
by the sight of a horse attached to a
light buggy rolling down a forty-foot
bluff. The horpe and vehicle rolled over
&nd over, and when the bottom of the de
f jent was reached the broken buggy was
on top and the animal showed little evi
dence of being alive. Those who witness
ed the wild plunge did not know that Mrs.
William Inch of 442*2 Twenty-ninth street
had narrowly escaped being carried down
the bluff in the buggy.
William Inch and his -wife were out for
a drive through Golden Gate Park yester
day afternoon. They had reached Cliff
avenue and Ocean terrace, when Inch,
leaving his wife to take care of the horse,
got down from the buggy to stop a run
away. The horse became frightened and
got beyond Mrs. Inch's control. It started
on a wild dash down Cliff avenue, but
turned suddenly off into a small alley
â which terminates at the head of the bluff
back of the Ocean Beach Pavilion. Be
fore the horse reached the edge Mrs. Inch
leaped out into the sand. She was un
injured by the fall.
Officer Greggains reached the struggling
horse a few moments after its plunge.
.After the tangled harness had bÂ«Â»en cut
away the animal was able to get up and
soon recovered sufficiently to be taken
back to the stable from which Inch had
rented it. The buggy was a wreck, one
wheel being completely smashed.

Boy Loses Leg.
Bert Garofalo, a seven-year-old boy liv
ing at 741 Green street, was run over by
a Haisht-street car near the Stanyan
street terminus yesterday afternoon and
had his right leg badly crushed. The boy,
in company with a companion of about
the same age, had been visiting the
Chutes and nad gone to the terminus to
board a car. A car started as he reached
the turntable and the boy ran after it.
As he was getting on the dummy his foot
slipped and he fell under the wheels and
the car passed over his leg. The injured
boy was taken t<* the home of Dr. Ragaii
on Hai^ht street and later sent to the
hospital. The limb was so badly man
gled that Dr. Murphy found it necessary
to amputate it below the knee.

BY FIRE IN THE HOLD OF A SHIP
Cargo of Coal on the C. F. Sargent, From Seattle, Becomes
Ignited and the Government and State Boats Hurry to
the Aid of the Big Craft, Which Flies Distress Signals
p || *J HERE was a. scene of wild ex-
I citement aboard the American ship
I C. F. Sargent at noon yesterday.
il Captain Melville was at that hour
about to sit down to lunch, but
the cabin boy rushed into the dining
room and exclaimed, "There's something
the matter forward, sir." The master,
thinking there was a row among the crew,
rushed forward with a gun in his hand,
but Immediately saw what was the mat
ter when the smoke issuing from the for
ward hold met his view.
All hands were called and the pumps
started as soon as It was known that
the ship was afire. Then the jack was
set in the mizzen, union down, and a. few
minutes later a crew from the Albatross,
commanded by Lieutenant C. S. Kempff,
was aboard. These men could not do
much, as they had no appliances, but it
was not long betore the army transport
tug Slocum was on the scene, and then
the men from the Albatross joined forces,
with the crew of the Slocum and effect
tive work was done. . â â¢ f
The Slocum was awaiting orders at thq
foot of Folsom street, and Captain Harry
Marshall had strolled down to see that
everything was moving along in ship
shape fashion. While in the pilot-house
the second mate came to him .and said,
"Captain, a ship in the stream is flying
signals of distress." A glance through

Complaint had been made at police
headquarters by residents on Larkin

that every Sunday morning for some
weeks past their papers had been stolen
from their doorsteps, and the three de
tectives were detailed to catch the thief
or thieves.
They saw the three boys stealing the
papers from the different houses. When
they observed the officers, the boys ran In
different directions, and each of the de
tectives went after a boy and overtook
him. Sullivan gave O'Dea a run of sev
eral blocks before effecting his capture.
The boys had stolen between forty and
fifty morning papers, eaching having a
supply. They all live on the Barbary

the glasses showed fire coming from the
Sargent, and Captain Marshall, without
waiting to change his clothes, rang', up
the signal to "get ready." Two minutes
later the Slocum was on her way to the
burning ship and inside of a quarter; of
an hour had three streams of water pour
ing Into the Sargent's hold.
Streams Poured Into Cargo.
Shortly afterward the State tug Gov
ernor Markham came along and helped
materially In saving the ship. Holes were
cut in the deck and through these streams
of water were poured into the vessel until
it seemed she would settle down. At one
time six feet of water was in the hold,
but still the fire kept on, and finally about
9 p. m. it was decided to run her onto the
mud flats and scuttle her.
The C. F. Sargent has had a most
eventful voyage. She left Seattle on No
vember 18 with 2400 tons of coal and a
week later was compelled to put into
Clallem Bay, leaking. At that time the

SHIP C. F. SARGENT ON FIRE
AND TUGS SLOCUM AND GOVER
NOR MARKHAM ASSISTING HER.
coal cargo was in good order, but never-,
theless Captain Melville decided to cross
the Sound and dock at Esquimau, B. C,
for repairs. This was done, and after a
thorough overhauling the Sargent sailed
again for San Francisco on December 13.
She made a good run down the coast, ar
riving last Thursday. She anchored off
Harrison-street wharf and was to have
docked to-day. j â 
Captain's Statement. v 'f '
Captain Melville of the C. F. , Sargent
said:
I suppose it ' was spontaneous combustion.
How else to explain the matter I don't know.
Seattle coal as a rule never catches fire, but
here is my ship and the cargo is on fire. It
looks to me as though she was on fire from
stem to stern, and while we may drown It out,
it seems that scuttling will have to be re
sorted to.
We only had an ordinary voyage from the
Sound to San Francisco. While we had no
heavy weather there were favorable breezes
and we made a splendid run from Flattery. 1
expected to dock Saturday, and had we done
so there would have been no mishap. As It Is
we will now have to take our chances.
Captain Marshall of the transport tug
Slocum did splendid work on the burning
ship. He was alongside half an hour be
fore another fireboat showed up and had
it not been for him and his vessel the
Sargent would have been burned to the
water's edge.
The ship was out of sight from the
State fire tugs and until the news was
carried to the office nobody Knew that a
s hl P, *n the bay was afire. Then the
Marknam was sent out under "rush" or
ders and stayed by the burning ship.
The C. F. Sargent is one of the old
timers. Away back in 1875 she was one
of the American clippers and was named
after her builder. She came around the
Horn and In recent years was purchased
by George E. Plummer of this city. She
is 1566 tons net burden, 220 feet 3 inches
long:, .41 feet 3 inches beam and 26 feet
deep.
