TV.. WASHINGTON; I>ec. 17.âNegotia
tion for treaties â with Nicaragua and Cos
ta Rica for the construction by the United
States of the Xicaragruan canal has been
zna.de possible by the ratification of the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty.
Lord Pauncefote, the British Embassa
Â£or, called at the State Department after
the meeting of the Cabinet to-day and
discussed with Secretary Hay the details
of the ceremony in connection with the
exchange of ratifications of the canal
treaty. Lord Pauncefote expects that the
ceremony will occur within a -month.
In anticipation of the ratification. Sec
retary Hay had directed Minister Merry
to Eign protocols with the Xicaraguan
and Costa Ric&n governments embodying
the terms upon which they would permit
the United States to build the canal.
It Is the purpose of the Secretary to in
corporate the provisions of these proto
cols In the treaties, which will be sub
mitted to the Senate probably befqre the
close of the present session of Congress.
Whfen these treaties have been ratified,
the authorities say. there will be no fur
ther diplomatic obstacles in the way of
the construction of the canal.
While the Senate was in executive ses
sion to-day Morgan of Alabama made an
effort to have the Senate make his bill
authorizing the acquisition of a right of
Tray for the propped isthmian canal
across Costa Rica and Nicaragua the spe
cial order for 2 o'clock to-morrow, but
the Senate declined to make the order.
It was suggested ' that Morgan might
move to take up the bill to-morrow. Â» HÂ»
Indicated a purpose to pursue this course.
LONDON, Dec. 17.â With the exception
of the Globe, the newepapers to-day com
ment approvingly on the ratification of
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty by the United
States Senate. The Globe sees - In the
overwhelming majority for the ratifica
tion proof that the compact is regarded
by the Eenate as one-sided and calculated
to adversely aitect British political and
commercial interests.
"Senator Teller's offensive phrase, 'in
her present mood,' clearly signifies," the
paper says, "the conviction that England
fh as become too submissive to stand up
for her rights against the great republic."
The Globe concludes: "It is a surren
der, not a bargain. We hand over nation
al property as purchase money for Ameri
can friendship."
ALBAN SCOBES CASTEOa
COLON, Dec. 17. â The correspondent
here of the Associated Press requested
General Carlos Alban, Governor of Pan
ama, and military commander of this dis
trict, to explain Colombia's refusal to ac
cept the conditions of arbitration de
manded by Venezuela. General Alban has
replied to this request in the following
terms:
' "General Castro, Prcside;itÂ»of Venezuela.
is The principal factor in the Colombian
revolution. Since ' the beginning of the

CALL BUREAU. H06 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.âSemi-offi
cial advices received here indicate that
active hostilities are about to begin be
tween Colombia and Venezuela. The de
lay in proceeding to extremes has been
largely caused by the lack of a suitable
stock of arms and ammunition by the
Colombian Government. This is about to
be remedied.
News that comes to-day is to the effect
that the British steamship Bamreagh,
which recently excited suspicion by, load-
Ing a large cargo of arms in European
waters, supposedly intended for the Boer*
in South Africa, really was chartered by
the Colombian Government. She is now
very near Colon.
Under orders by the Navy Department
to-day the battleship Indiana will be
added to the North Atlantic squadron dur
ing Its winter cruise in the Caribbean
Sea. According to the department this
Increase of the squadron has no connec
tion whatever with the demonstration
which Germany contemplates making
against Venezuela. The Indiana is In the
West Indies training her crew of lands
men. She will merely abandon the itin
erary which she would have followed had
she remained in the training service and
followed that adopted upon the recom
mendation of Rear Admiral Higginson.
This means that a squadron consisting of
the battleships Kearsarge, Alabama, Mas
sachusetts and Indiana will cruise in the
vicinity of Venezuela throughout the win
ter. :
COLON, Dec. 17.â A woman colonel,
Senora Ramona Mendoza, fought bravely
with the insurgent force in the conflicts
between the Colombian Government and
rebel troops at Nombre de Dlos last week.
Her husband and brother were killed last
Thursday. When the Government troops
drove the insurgents from, the trenches
on Friday Senora Mendoza escaped to San
Bias in a Email boat with the Indians.
Senora Mendoza has been an intrepid
fighter during the last two insurrections
on the Isthmus. She displayed gallantry
In the recent battle at Buena Vi6ta.
According to the latest advices the
rebels are still offering resistance to the
Government near Nombre de Dlos.
Employes of the Caribbean Manganese
Mining Company at Nombre de Dios have
arrived in Colon. They feared that their
lives would be endangered by remaining
at the former place.
When ' the Government reinforcements
arrived in two sloops at Nombre de Dios
last week a rebel force In small vessels
endeavored to get near enough to throw
dynamite bombs on the Government
boats, but did not succeed owing to the
superiority of the latter craft In sailing.
The Government wounded are still at
Nombre de Dios. About twenty soldiers
who are ill have returned to Colon.
Among the rebels killed during the fight
ing was their leader. Colonel Sosa. He
was one of the revolutionists who sur
rendered when Colon was recaptured by
the Government. No revolutionists were
taken prisoners.
The Colombian warship General Pirizon
has gone to Nombre de Dios, where Col
onel Duque is" In command of the Govern
ment forces. Colonel Duque has been
praised for hl3 leadership.
It is reported that Rio Hacha has been
captured by the revolutionists. The

Committee.
Mayor- Elect Schmitz and the
Police Tak3 a Hand in
tha Trouble.
After Once Being Deposed J. S. Parry
Is Re-elected Chairman and
G. W. Aubertin Is Again
Chosen Secretary, . . .
All kinds of troubles are besetting the
executive committee of the Union Labor
party. Democratic politicians are en
deavoring to secure control of the new or
ganization, it is said, and in an endeavor
to effect their purpose demands have been
made upon Mayor-elect Schmitz . for two
of the most important positions in his
gift. Schmitz says he is unpledged, will
not promise anything and proposes to run
the municipality according to his own
ideas. He took a hand in a stormy meet-
Ing held last night, carried the meeting
and finally invoked the aid of the police in
the Interests of harmony. ,
The meeting was 'originally called at 113
O'Farrell street, In the rooms of the The
atrical Employes' Association. There were
twenty-flve members present. As soon as
the members got together they agreed to
"disagree. A week ago J. S. Parry and G.
W. Aubertln were deposed from t\\e posi
tion respectively of chairman and secre
tary. This action was reversed last night,
and Parry Is back in his old position.
William Delaney presided for a time last
night. He had as active supporters Ryan,
Stanton, Powers and a few others. They
carried things with a high hand, and al
though vociferously outvoted Delaney,
who was wielding the gavel, declared
everything carried. Then It was that
Parry's adherents â  and Mayor-elect
Schmitz declared themselves. The meet
ing was adjourned, another hall secured
and a new organization effected.
Delaney's partisans were confronted
with a serious difficulty at the outset.
There were no minutes of the previous
meeting, neither was there a roll call.
When It became necessary to call the roll
no one was in a position to do so.
Police Clear the Hall.
Between the Mayor-elect and the police
the harmony so much desired waa re
stored. The hall -was cleared and seven
teen members of the executive commit
tee went to another hall, effected an or
ganlzatlon and Introduced resolutions.
The second meeting was held in Unity
Hall, across the street. At the old hall
even the Mayor-elect was a persona non
grata.
As soon as the committee had reorgan
ized a permanent organization -was effect
ed by the election of J. P. Parry as chair
man; J. J. Dowllng of the Hackmen's
Union, vice-chairman; S. T>. Simmons of
the Theatrical Employes* j Union, treas
urer; and C. M. Holloway'of the Coal
ShovelersV and Trestle Workers' Union,
sergeant-at-arms.
. Captain Krimpoft of the Laundry
Drivers* Union introduced a resolution
calling for harmony In the party, declar
ing that the meeting place should be
changed and denouncing the tactics of the
minority. This was unanimously carried.
A. H. Ewell of the Stationary Engineers'
Union moved to adopt a constitution and
by-laws. This was seconded by Roxburg
of the Printing - Pressmen's Union and
was unanimously carried.
Before the meeting adjourned It was
Unanimously decided to ask for a recount
of ballots In all cases -where such a re
count might prove advantageous to the
Labor Union candidate at the recent elec
tion. The unions were called upon to fur
nish the financial means necessary to de
fray the expenses of these recounts.

Sargent Replies to Schwab.
Sargent, replying to \ the criticism of
Charles M. Schwab as to organized labor,
said that unionism was not a menace but
an instrument of peace and good, was
within the law and was a strong influence
toward the maintenance of the republic
"We are taking down the barriers," hÂ«
said, "that have seemed to separate us.
"We are privileged to touch elbows here
and exchange ideas, and I feel sure that
good will come of it. The trouble hr the
past has been that we have not under
stood one another. " There can be no cap
ital without labor and the man who does
the work and the man who manipulates
the capital should realize their dependence
on one another. The great leader of cap
ital who spoke yesterday would. have lit
tle capital to manipulate buffor;'the work
of the men In the furnaces and the mines.
That is the fact that I ask capital to re
member." â  ' â¢ - -
Sargent said the, firemen had long sine*
adopted the policy of reasoning with their
employers and educating their own men
to a point of Intelligence as fi> the lights
of both- themselves and their employers.
They, made no sacrifice of their rights or
manhood.
"But," he added, "they reserved thÂ«
right to resist oppression, to crush wrong
where reason did not prevail." He said
that when labor and capital would fairly
and reasonably 'meet one another Indus
trial disorder would be greatly reduced.
Clearing House for Disputes.
Lewis Nixon, ship builder, who followed
Sargent, said that he hoped the confer
ence would effect the organization of a
sort of industrial clearing house wherÂ«
disputes could be settled. He favored or
ganized labor, and in criticism of It had
only to say that he thought It needed a
greater, spirit of Americanism, for he be
lieved certain objectionable things which
had grown up In other countries had been
imported here. - .
" In a telegram to the conference, Carroll
D. Wright, United States Commissldner ol
Labor, urged the adoption of the Joini
committee plan for the settlement of laboi
troubles.
The officers of the American Federation

John E. Sexton Files
Charges With the

Man Who Bunkoed Ex-Presi

Again to the Fore.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 17.â A petition
â¢was filed with Governor Gage to-day call
ing upon him to transmit to the Legisla
ture in regular or extra session charges
cf forgery against Superior Judge M. P.
Bennett of El Dorado County. The peti
tioner and accuser is John E. Sexton of
Placerville. He asks for the impeachment
of the Magistrate on the ground, as al
leged, that about midnight of February
â , liwi. Judge Bennett caused to be re
moved and altered a judgment of record
in the case of Sexton at a time when Sex
ton was seeking release on a writ of
habeas corpus on the alleged insufficiency
of the original certified judgment.
Sexton was convicted, with S. H.
Briggs, of extortion committed upon a
Placerville cigar dealer named C. Green
wald, and was sentenced to two years' im
prisonment. It was charged that he and
Briggs had induced the cigar dealer to
â  sell them cigars from a box which had
been refilled, contrary to the internal rev
enue laws, and then had "shaken him
down' 1 for J3O on pain of informing the
Federal authorities. Sexton has fought
his case to the United States Supreme
Court, where it is now pending.
Sexton has had a checKered -n:story and
his deeds have formed the subject of
many a special newspaper story. After
having served a term in San Quentin he
went to Washington during tne second
Cleveland administration, and was not
there long before he had worked himself
into White House society and the confi
dence of the President himself, who
eought his advice relative to Pacific Coast
patronage. Cleveland was so taken with
him that" he agreed to make him a fish
eries inspector in Alaska, and the appoint
ment was about to be made out when
Max Popper of San Francisco arrived on
ihe scene and revealed Sexton's record.
Sexton left Washington and returned to
San Francisco, where he was accused of
having passed worthless checks for large
sums on George Haas, the Market-street
candy manufacturer, and Lawyer Robert
A. Friedrich. Governor Budd afterward
became interested in him and made him
a delegate to a Salt Lake mining conven
t.'-n.
Sexton makes a good impression by his
manner and is regarded as extremely
shrewd. He gives Governor Gage the
names of Sheriff Bosquit, Deputy Sheriff
Houx, County Clerk Fisher, Constable
Davey and Attorney Fred Irwin of Pla
cerville as witnesses in support of his ac
cusations against Judge Bennett.
LOCOMOBILES TO BJTN â¢
TO THE GRAND CANYOII
unver .Lippincott Will Make Trial
Trip to Test the Feasibility
of the Project.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 17.â A company
organized .among the citizens of Flagstaff
has under consideration the establishment
of a line of steam locomobiles to run be
tween Flagstaff and Grand Canyon, a dis
tance of seventy-two miles. In order to
test the practicability of this scheme and
oemonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt
its feasibility the company has arranged
with Oliver Lippincott of this city to
make the trial trip on a machine especial
ly adapted to the road and grades of the
country about Flagstaff.
This machine is to be a steam locomo
bile, capable of burning either coal oil or
gasoline, and, with its trailer, will weigh
2200 pounds. The trailer will carry 110 gal
lons of water and fuel, and 1000 pounds of
paraphernalia. The run from Flagstaff to
the Grand Canyon is to be a race against
time over roads which are by no means of
the best. Mr. Lippincott expects to make
the trip in three hours and a half. W. E.
Chapman will accompany Mr. Lippincott
Mr. Lippincott holds the present road
record between Los Angeles and Pomona.
His best achievement, however, was that
of last year while in the losemite Valley
He entered the Yosemite, ran ninety-two
miles and climbed 9400 feet in the actual
running time of eight hours and fourteen
minutes.
The trial trip probaoly will be made
from Flagstaff about December 28.

MINER'S CACHE
CHEATS DEATH
Starving Men Find ' a
. Hidden . Supply of
Spend Seven Days in Wilder
ness Without a Morsel
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, D"cc. 17.â Martini O'Connor,
formerly of Seattle, and two comrades
have Just reached Dawson after a nerve
racking experience In the Tanana coun
try. For seven days 'the three men were
lost In the wilderness, and their only
food during that entire time was a few
mouthfuls of dry flour, without even salt
to flavor it. When dying of starvation,
they chanced upon a supply of food cached
by some prospector, and were saved.
Eventually they reached Eagle and tlnally
Dawson.
O'Connor and his companions spent the
summer prospecting on Chenoa river, at
the head of tne Tanana. The burning of
their cabin one day while they were at
work threw them into the predicament of
having to subsist for a week. on a small
bucket of flour, the only thing saved from
the flames.
The three set out for Eagle City over
the, Tanana divide. After three days' hard
travel they found they had lost tne trail.
For three more days they retraced their
steps, until they came to the point from
which they had started. They were al
most famished. The nex.t morning they
started due" east by their compass. They
were then on some creek whose name
they did not know, and they followed It
for four hours, and came to a cabin. They
searched this thoroughly for food, but did
not find a morsel. O'Connor's two com
panions lay down, almost dead from star
vation. O'Connor continued his search
about the place and was rewarded by
finding a cache near by. In It were canrel
fruits, beef extract and vegetables. He
summoned the others and they soon were
satisfying their hunger. :
The party remained at the cache three
days and nights, eating and resting after
their extraordinary toils and trials. They
then continued toward Eagle. After leav
ing the cache they saw no one on the
stream. The creek for its entire length
was deserted, and O'Connor and his part
ners do not know yet whose food it was
that saved their lives.
Leaving this creek the party came to
another, and ten hours later came upon a
prospector in a tent. This man told them
he was on Slate Creek, three days' travel
from Eagle. The party pushed on to Eagle
reaching that camp in three days.

OREGON FARMERS FLAK
GREAT COYOTE HUNT
Hope to Drive Thousands of the Ma
rauders Into a Pen and
Kill Them.
TACOMA, Dec. 17â Farmers of Walla
Walla and Umatllla counties, in Oregon,
are getting ready for the greatest coyote
hunt ever held in the Northwest. It will
start about Christmas time and last a
week. Coyotes have multiplied rapidly of
late and are causing .immense trouble to
sheep men and ranchers who keep small
stock and poultry. It is proposed to build
a "pen" at Echo, a small station on the
line of the Oregon Railway and Naviga r
tion Company, and then organize bands
of men to traverse the country in one
long line and drive the prairie wolves to
gether near this inclosure. With a .large
body of men the coyotes can be forced
into the pen and easily slaughtered.
The coyote drive has been a familiar
sport during recent years, a number hav
ing been held with varying results. Wal
la Walla will supply 100 men to Join next
week's hunt, Pendleton will send 100 and
smaller towns will be represented in pro
portio.n. Some estimate that not less than
10.000 ' coyotes can .be rounded up and
killed. . .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1901.
SCULPTOR AITKEN CREATES LIFE-LIKE
STATUE OF THE MARTYRED PRESIDENT
Design Submitted jn Competition for the Santa Clara County Memorial
Shows the Late William McKinley in a Characteristic Attitude and Is
Praised for Its Delicate Accuracy of Feature, Pose and Expression
-^-^ AN. JOSE. Dec. 17.â Robert I. Ait
ft^^ ken,; the San' Francisco sculptor,
N^^% has submitted a design, in com
iV_j/ petition, for the monument to be
' erected in St. James Park by_the
citizens of Santa Clara County in niern-'
ory of William McKinley. The" young
artist's work has created a favorable im
pression with all who have seen the model.
i Mr. Altken prepared three pieces for
submission to the committee, and at the
sculptor's suggestion tfie works were hot
sent to San Jose, as tHelr size and deli
neate workmanship "made, transportation
dangerous. The committee, . therefore,
deemed a visit to the sculptor's studio ad
visable, and last week went to San Fran
cisco. It found, besides the design for the
monument and surroundings, a life-size
portrait bust â¢of . the , President, and a
miniature full -figure. The portrait bust
Is so excellent that upon its elimination
one of the committee gave an order to
Mr. Aitken for a bronze on the buyer's
personal account.*- â¢ . â " ' i
i This portrait bust is a wonderfully life
like production. The well remembered
features of the President are molded in
the clay with a faithfulness rarely seen
in portrait. work of this character. In the
model for the statue the same life and
expression are found.'. The face, while full
of the quiet dignity so characteristic of
the man, bears a smile, or at least a well
defined suspicion' of one, which lights it
up and supplies that undefinable quality
known, for want of a better word, as
vitality. â  '. /
Desire for the Monument.
The Altken design provides for a terrace
of about three feet height, . on top of
which is to be laid a flooring: of mosaic
"YOU SIT DOWN!"
SAYS THE COURT
â  .
Daily Disciplining of Law
yers Continues in
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALTUBAS, Dec. 17.â Any one drifting
into' the Superior Court of Modoc County
these' days might" be at a. loss -to deter
mine whether a murder trial or a brawl
were in' progress. â¢ So bitter has the en
mity between prosecution and defense be
come that there is an almostV constant
exchange of personalities. Attorney Ra
ker, whose repartee occasionally lacks ele
ments of refinement, referred to Assist
ant Attorney General Post this after
noon as a skunk:, or, to be more ac
curate, he declared that in his opinion the
State's representative "is no better than
a skunk." i
: This remark was , occasioned by inci
dents during the examination of Domingo
Simas, a Portuguese rancher, who Is a
witness for the prosecution. Simas testi
fied that he was in Lookout two flays
while aged Calvin Hall and the four other
alleged thieves were in Jail. At that time
Justice of the Peace Myers told him that
he was afraid the prisoners would be
lynched. Once, before answering a ques
tion, Simas looked toward Post Interro
gatively. To this the defense entered an
objection. Lawyer Raker attempted to
show that the witness had talked with
representatives of the prosecution as to
the nature of his testimony, and to this
end put a series of confusing and mis
leading questions. Judge Harrington fin
ally declared that Raker was misrepre
senting matters. Raker attempted to talk.
"You sit down," ordered Judge Harring
ton, "Or I shall send you to Jail."
. Post questioned the veracity of Raker
on some point, and it was here that the
lawyer for the defense began drawing in
vidious comparisons.
When some measure of calm had been
restored, the examination of Simas was
continued. He said he had heard Isom
Eades say "they ought to be hung." This
occurred in Morris' store and Eades was
talking with Morris about .the five men
then under arrest. Eades said they had
'done enough to be hung."
Robert Cortwright was recalled. to tes
tify regarding some minor point. After
Ccrtwright had been examined at some
length. Raker offered to prove that Cort
wright's reputation for- truth, honesty
and integrity was bad, and that he had
been Impeached In a case at Lookout some
time ago. Raker then asked the witness
if it were not a fact that he had been im
peached? To this Cortwright replied thai
"a long, hungry thing tried it, but he
failed, just like you â¢ will." The witness
referred to Attorney John Brown, an un
cle of the defendant.
Attorney- Harris said that Cortwright
was old 'enough to have quit lying by
this time. Cortwright excitedly exclaimed
that were he out of the courtroom' there
would be trouble .between him and Harris.

RAILROAD MEN
COME TO TERMS
The Southern Pacific and
Rock Island Now in.
CHICAGO, Dec. 17.â A1l doubt regarding
tho attitude of the Southern Pacific to
ward the Rock Island on account- of the
latter's El Paso extension was removed
to-day when traffic relations of the friend
liest' character were entered Into by the
traffic men representing both companies. â 
To the Rock Island officials, at least, the
solution of the problem Is highly gratify
ing and to it may largely be ascribed the
emphatic declaration made by Chairman
Cable, who said:
"We have no intention of building from
El Paso to the coast, and unless . condi
tions greatly, change I see no reason for
our changing our position In the matter."
The future relations between the South
ern Pacific and the Rock Island were; set
tled at a conference held between J. G.
Stubbs, traffic director for the Harriman
lines, and J. M. Johnson, third vice-presi
dent and -freight traffic manager- for the
Rock Island. These officials were not long
in arriving at an agreement which, put
simply, is to the effect that the Southern
Pacific will place the Rock Island on a
parity with the Southern Pacific's connec
tions as soon as the El Paso extension is
opened for traffic.
This arrangement is of a reciprocal
character. The Rock Island will deliver
all Its Southern California traffic to the
Southern Pacific at El Paso, and the
Southern Pacific agrees to treat the Rock
Island exactly, the same as It treats its
other connections. This can mean nothing
else than a fair division of traffic in re
turn. !

BOHN IS GIVEN
HIS CHILDREN
Point Loma Theosophists
Are Defeated in
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 17.â Judge Shaw
to-day decided in favor of the father the
contest between John J. Bohn, a news
paper publisher of Chicago, and his wife
for the custody of their two children. The
case came to the Los Angeles court from
San Diego on a writ of habeas corpus,
sworn out by Bohn, and has attracted
considerable interest owing to the fact
that Mrs. Bohn has been attended at all
the sessions of the court by Madame Ttag
ley, head of the Point Loma home of the
Universal Brotherhood, and other officials
in that branch of theTheosophical Soci
ety. The taking of testimony occupied
four days.
Madame Tingley was on the witness
stand this forenoon and part of the after
noon and her testimony was all in favor
of Mrs.. Bohn. She told of the several
visits of Bohn to tho Point Loma home
and asserted that his real purpose was to
kidnap his children. The witness recount
ed the details of her first meeting with the
Bohn family and told why she would not
admit the children to the school in her
Institution. Continuing, she said that she
believed that Bohn and Mrs. Green, his
wife's mother, exercised a diabolical in
fluence over .the two Bohn children and
their mother. She talked nervously and"
was warned repeatedly by the court for
talking back and scolding the opposing
counsel. -^7
When the testimony was concluded
Judge Shaw gave the custody of the two
boys to Bonn and required him to supply
a bond in the sum of $500 for their safe
presentation in â  Chicago by Thursday
next, < in compliance with an order of a
Chicago court wherein divorce proceed
ings between the Bohns are pending.

Rock Jutting Out at Surface
Yields Thousand Dollars
to the Ton.
MOKELUMNE HILL, Dec. 17.â M. A.
Kiser to-day discovered a rich quartz
prospect on the summit of. French Hill,
in the eastern suburbs of town. The for
mation is of porphyry and pieces of rock
taken practically at the surface and put
through' hand-crushing show ~a prospect
that would at a conservative estimate
yield $1000 to the ton. The rock crops oui
prominently on the surface, and was prob
ably walked over unnoticed by thou
sands of miners, because of its peculiar
character and close resemblance to
country rock. The gold is extremely fine.
Just below this J. B. Maguire, while
ground sluicing during the last heavy
rain, found a quartz nugget valued at $S.
This prospect is within a few hundred
yards of the old French Hill placer i
diggings, which were in early days the i
richest in the State.
"Bogie" O'Donnell Injured.

O'Donnell, met a serious accident here to

this evening in the Arlington Hotel.
O'Donnell accepted an Invitation from
Lewis Pierce to accompany him and one
of his drivers on a horseback ride to one
of the Pierce ranches near town to drive
in a band of sheep. O'Donnell mounted
his horse on Main street and, as he held
the reins too tightly, the animal reared
and fell backward on top of him, the horn
of the saddle striking him In the groin.
Dr. Downing expressed the opinion that
O'Donnell's injuries are of a serious na
ture, as there is danger of internal com
plications.

THE FEAR OF HUMBUG
Prevents Many People From Trying
a Good Medicine.
'-|:Jmach troubles are so common and In
most cases so obstinate to cure that people
are apt to look with suspicion on any
remedy claiming to be a radical, perma-
nent cure for dyspepsia and indigestion.
Many such pride themselves on their
acuteness in never being humbugged,
especially in medicines.
This fear of being humbugged can be
carried too far, so far, in fact, that many
people suffer for years with weak diges-
tion rather than risk a little time and
money in faithfully testing the claims
made of a preparation so reliable and uni-
versally used as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets.
Now, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different in one important respect
from ordinary proprietary medicines, for
the reason that they are not a secret pat-
ent medicine. No secret is made of their
ingredients, although they are sold by all
druggists under protection of trade mark,
but analysis shows them to contain the
natural, digestive ferments, pure aseptic
pepsin, the digestive acids, Golden Seal,
bismuth, hydrastls and nux. They are
not cathartic, neither do they act power-
fully on any organ, but they cure indiges-
tion on the common sense plan of digest-
ing the food eaten thoroughly before it
has time to ferment, sour and cause the
mischief. This is the only secret of their
success. â¢..-'
Cathartic pills never have and never can
cure indigestion and stomach troubles, be-
cause they act entirely on the bowels,
whereas the whole trouble is really In the
stomach. ?
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken , after
meals digest the food. T,hat is all there is
to it. Food not digested or half-digested
is poison, as it creates gas, acidity, head-
aches, palpitation of the heart, loss of
,1esh and many other troubles which are
often called by some other name.

The Complainant Against
Dowie Tells of Some
Mysteries.
"Witness In Chicago Court
Describes the "Healer's"
Practice.
CHICAGO, Deo. 17.â Testimony -was of
fered before Judge Tuley to-day In the suit
for the appointment of a reoetver for John
Alexander Dowle'a Zion lace Industries to
show that Dowle possessed some myste
rious power over his disciples, and that
bj^neans of it he induced them to obey
hi* commands Implicitly.
Samuel Stevenson, the plaintiff, who
charges Dowle with having defrauded
mm or $155,000 by his power, went on the
witness stand again at the opening session
and swore that Dowle waved his hands
and exerted this Influence by pressing him
closely to his body.
The attorney for the defense tried to
nave this power appear In the records as
magnetism, but the court would not per
mit It. Stevenson testified that three
times he had felt an indescribable awe
when Dowie pressed him to his body, and
that from this influence he and other per
sons felt that Dowle could call down a
curse upon him effectually. He related
how Dowle Is said to havo declared that
If Dwisrht L. Moody did not cease his
fight against Zion he would not say that
Moody might not die. and that later
Dowie told how Moody had taken sick
and died. Stevenson told how three times
he had tried to get out from under
Dcwie's influence, but had failed until
now.
During the testimony a dramatic recital
was made how Dowle had declared him
self to be Elijah the Restorer, how at the
"last day" he would be caught up In the
clouds, and of the dark days to come for
all outside Zion.

THOUSANDS PREPARING THE LUN6S FOR
PNEUMONIA AND CONSUMPTION
IN THIS WAY. '
HOW TO PREVENT IT.
"I coughed all night long ," Is an ex-
pression you hear dally at this season of
the year, and these same people are the
very ones who later on will sicken and
die of pneumonia or consumption.
It is the strangest thing In the world
j^iat people having a slight pain Â¦ In the
e tomach will rush to the doctors' or drug-
gists' for medicine, but do nothing for a
cough that Is irritating the bronchial
tubes and lungs and making them ready
to receive and nourish the germs of pneu-
monia and consumption, which are In-
haled daily by every living person.
Formerly there might have been some
excuse for this, but now that the United
States Health Reports and Government
Statistics have pointed out a remedy by
â¢which coughs, catarrh and consumption
can be cured, there is none.
Hyomei, the new dry air germicide, is
the only remedy ever endorsed by such
an authority, and during the past year
has. reduced the death rate from consump-
tion 35 per cent.
Coughs, Colds, Croup, Catarrh and Con-
sumption cannot exist where Hyomei Is
breathed daily. There are no teaspoonful
doses, nothing but a little Inhaler charged
v.-ith Hyomel. A few inhalations at any
time during the day or night will allay all
Irritation, stop the cough and destroy all
disease germs breathed into the head,
throat and lungs.
Hyomel costs but 51.00 either at your
ciuggist's or sent by mail and will last
one month if used twenty times daily.

JURY WILL PASS TO-DAY ON GUILT
OR INNOCENCE OF STANTON'S SLAYER
Several Prominent Citizens of Vallejo Testify to the Good Reputation Borne
by the Defendant, Who Claims That He Shot in Defense of His Own
Life When He Slew the Man Who Boasted of Having Deceived His Sister
MRS. STANTON, "WIDOW OF THE VICTIM OF DUNPHY'S VENGEANCE, TESTIFYING ON THE WITNESS
STAND THAT HER HUSBAND NEVER CARRIED A REVOLVER, THREE MEMBERS OF THE DEFENDANT'S
FAMILY AND THE MEN WHO WILL DECIDE HIS FATE. -
P-JTS HE trial of James Dunphy of Val-

Ji ber 27, came to a close In Judge
Cook's court yesterday. The jury
will be charged this morning by the court
and the case submitted for a verdict.
"William Collins, who was ordered into
court to explain why he failed to remem
ber whether he was ever convicted of the
crime of kidnaping two girls, took the
stand yesterday and admitted that he was
convicted of the offanse charged. He tes
tllied that he disliked to make the admis
sion last Friday because he was loth to
have his past paraded before the public
view. On his examination in behalf of the
defendant he swore that he saw a pistol
in Stanton's possession. The prosecution
sought to impeach Collins by showing

the history of the toller from captivity In

slavery and serfdom, down to modern
times.
Must Merge Interests.
"It is as Idle to think that the indlvid
ua. worker can secure justice as to think
that the rudderless ship can escape the
tempest," said Gompers. "It is necessary
for him to merge his interests with his
fellows and thus obtain his rights. I have
not and I will not now join In the hue
and cry against combinations of cabital.
I may say, parenthetically, that I do ob
ject to the trusts Interfering with. the po
llu;al affairs of the country, and partic
ularly with the judiciary. Dealing with
them Industrially, I welcome them. I
also wish to see organization of the work
ers, and I believe the best interests of
the two will prevail when their repre
sentatives meet and fairly and honestly
adjust their differences. They are jointly
elements in the production and distribu
tion of wealth. The employer has no
right to say to the laborer that there is
nothing between them to arbitrate. That
declaration has all the vlciousness of the
old relation of the .master and slave."
Gompers expressed objection to the
OFFICIALS OF NEWFOUNDLAND.
Continued From Page One.
Government desired to consult me regard
ing life saVing stations. For many rea
sons Nova Scotia would be as desirable
for the site of a large North American
station as Newfoundland, if not prefera
ble. Halifax has the advantage of being
on the mainland and closer than St. Johns
to the business centers of the continent.
I must confess, however, that my hope
is that the station will be near St. Johns.
This is largely a matter of sentiment, as
both the Government and the people have
shown me every kindness.

Testimony was then offered tending 1 to
show that Stanton had made a boast of
the fact that he had deceived Kittle Dun

ant, testified that he told his son of the
trouble that had come upon the family,

pressed the opinion that they have suf
fered enough for the errors they made
in such cases. Continuing, Gompers said:
"Labor need have no fear for the
future. Absolute assurance for it lies In
the Justice of Its cause, the humane prin
ciples upon which it works, and in the
grit and courage which make up the
American people."
Should -Reason Together.
John Mitchell, president of 'the United
Mine Workers of America, strongly advo
cated peace. .
"I think," he said, "the solution ofltho
labor problem Is not a difficult one. It
needs no introduction of Utopian ideas.
Men should reason together, and when
they are met they should be honest with
one another. I have never seen a strike
that could not have been .averted if -the
two interests had met fairly in advance
If the great plan outlined before this con
ference is carried out It will do more
good than any other movement in our
country. As one who knows the effect
of industrial war. no one will welcome
more than I Industrial peace. I have al
ways been for peace, only insisting that
the peace be honorable peace." â . -

Marconi declines to say anything about
the Cape Cod station, except that it is

There is a widespread and growing feel

American Telegraph Company's attitude
toward Marconi. The view taken by thq
public is that the company, seeing that
only two years of its monopoly remain
should not prevent the colony from en-
Joying the benefits of the new Invention

perfect the Marconi system.

testified positively that her husband never
carried a revolver. She told of a conver
sation with Witness Collins, in which he
informed her that he had said to Attor
ney J. J. Barrett, counsel for Dunphy,
that he had never seen Stanton with a
pistol. The evidence was important, In
that it flatly contradicted Collins' state
ment regarding Stanton's alleged habit of
carrying weapons.
The testimony in rebuttal was offered
with a view to showing that Stanton never
carried a revolver. The question of bring
ing Kittle Dunphy into court was consid
ered. â¢ She is at St. Mary's Hospital, and
as it would be necessary to bring her
into court upon a stretcher. Prosecuting
Attorney Alford admitted all that she
might testify to. The case was then ar
gued,-and Judge Cook announced that he
wou?d charge the jury this morning.

can Federation of Labor,, also spoke.

Archbishop Ireland made the closing ad
dress of the conference. He said In part:
"May the winds carry the news over the
continent and around the world that such
a" meeting as this has taken place In the
great city of New York. The hope of the
twentieth century is that the great prin
ciples of brotherhood, charity and justice
announced by the holy one of Palestine
shall become wider and deeper at this
time than at any other. Let us have In
dustrial peace. Let employer and em
ploye know that they are brothers. Let
charity and justice, and justice more
than charity, be the prevailing light of
this great nation."
Sargent then moved that a general ex
ecutive committee, composed of ten rep
resentatives of labor, ten of capital and
ten from the general public, be appointed
to take up the movement fostered by the
conference. The resolution was adopted
and Chairman Strauss soon after an
nounced the committee.
A sub-committee of three to consider
plans, scope and' procedure was appoint
ed.
The executive committee will meet to
morrow for organization, the election of

SMITH LEAVES
THE CABINET
The Postmaster-General
His High
Position.
President Roosevelt Selects a
Wisconsin Man for
Office.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17. â Charles
Emory Smith of Philadelphia has ten
dered to the President his formal resigna
tion as Postmaster-General, to take effect
early next month, and Henry C. Payne of
Wisconsin, vice-chairman of the Repub
lican National Committee, has accepted
the tender of the ofltce, to which he will
be nominated immediately after the holi
day recess. Smith has agreed to remain
until January 10, if necessary, but will
return immediately thereafter to Philadel
phia to resume the editorship of the Phil
adelphia Press.
This change was formally announced at
to-day's session of the Cabinet. ' All the
members of the Cabinet expressed their
regret and the President paid a tribute to
the services and personality of the retir
ing: member of his official family. He said
that he- had sought to persuade Smith to
alter his determination and to remain in
the Cabinet, but without success, and he
had finally accepted Smith's reasons as
decisive* -
Smith first announced to the President
i the latter part of last month that he had
decided to return to his editorial duties.
The President at that time urged him to
remain. Smith, however, had been fre
quently reminded by his business associ
ates of the duties devolving upon him, and
was anxious to return to them. He had
several talks with President Roosevelt on
the subject, and nnaliy on Saturday after
noon last formally tendered to .the Presi
dent the following' letter of resignation:
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec 14, 1901.
My Dear Mr. President: Following, my ver
bal communication uf some time ago, {I beg to
tender my resignation of the office of Post
master General, to take effect at your â  early
convenience on the appointment and qualifica
tion of my successor. This step is taken In
fulfillment of a plan long since formed for
purely personal reasons, the execution of
which has been delayed until it could be car
ried out without embarrassing your declared
policy and . until department measures In
which I am' deeply interested could be satis
factorily advanced and assured.
In laying down the trust committed to my
hands I want' to thank you most sincerely for
the confidence you have reposed in me, and lor
the great pleasure I have found in an asso
ciation which has deepened my esteem for you
personally and my admiration for- the spirit and
aims of your administration. With my beat
wishes that you may have the largest measure
of Buccess, I remain faithfully yours,
CHARLES EMORY SMITH.
Smith delayed the formal tender until
the President had chosen his successor.
Payne is now at his home in .Wisconsin.
His name will go into the Senate for con
firmation the first week of January. HÂ» is
expected to be ready to take charge of the
office by the middle of next month at the
latest. It is stated that no other changes
in the Cabinet are at present contem
plated. ' â¢
Smith has been Postmaster-General
since April 21, 1898, succeeding James A.
Gary of Maryland, virtually at the outset
of the Spanish war. Gary had been one
of President McKlnley's original Cabinet
appointees, but felt himself physically un
able to bear the strain of Cabinet duties
during the war.

HOW TO FIND OUfi
Fill a bottle or common glass with your
water and let It stand twenty-four hours;
a sediment or settling Indicates an un-
healthy jndition of the kidneys; If it
stains .e linen it la evidence of kidney
trouble; too frequent desire to pass It, or
pain In the back, is also convincing proof
that the kidneys and bladder are aut of
order.
WHAT TO DO.
There la comfort In the knowledge w
often expressed that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney and bladder rem-
edy, fulfills every wish in curing rheuma-
tism, Dain In the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hold
water and scalding pain in passing It, or
bad effects following use of liquor, win*
or beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the day and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the ex-
traordinary effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It stands the highest for Its
wonderful cures of the most distressing
cases. If you need a medicine you should
have the best. Sold by druggists In flfty-
cent and one-dollar sizes.
You may have a sample bottls of
Swamp-Root and a book that tells more
about it, both sent absolutely free by
mail. Address Dr. Kilmer & Co., Blng-

BRISK DEBATE
ON NEW COLONY
Philippine Islands * Rev
enue Bill Enlivens
Congress.
WASHINGTON". Dec. 17.â The bill to
provide temporary revenues for the Phil
ippine Islands was debated In the House
to-day and will be voted on to-morrow
at 4 o'clock. It was the first debate of
the session and was conducted without
display of. temper. Several lively ex
changes and an impassioned speech by
De Armond of Missouri, who has just re
turned from a trip to the Philippines, In
opposition to the retention of the Islands
were the features.
Payne, the floor leader of thÂ© majority,
opened the debate. Owing to the indispo
sition of Richardson, the duty of opening
tor the minority devolved . upon Swanson
of "Virginia. The other speakers were
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio and Robertson (!>.>â 
of Louisiana, for the bill, and Shafroth
(Silverite) of Colorado, De Armond (D.>
of Missouri, Thayer CD.) of Massachu
setts and Patterson (D.) of Tennessee,
against it.
To-morrow McCall. a Republican mem
ber of the Ways and Means Committee,
from Massachusetts, will oppose the bill,
time having been granted him by the
Democrats.
Payne aroused enthusiasm as he de
scribed the great work of civilization
which was going on along the line of edu
cation.
"Our friends on the other side," said
he, "howl about our imperialistic govern
ment over the natives. "We are trying to
lift them uo to the standard of American
citizenship." â¢
"Are you trying to fit them for citizen
ship In the United States or citizenship
In the Philippine Islands?" asked Games
of Tennessee.
"We will cross that bridge when wo
come to It," replied Payne. "But If you,
on the other side, will co-operate with uÂ«
we will fit them for citizenship In the
Philippine Islands, the United States or
any other country." (Republican ap
plause.) â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢. ....
"We will co-operate with you, replied
Games, "when you carry the constitution
and the flag to the Philippines."
"I am surprised," observed Payne, "to
hear the gentleman from Tennessee make
that statement. He has just returned
from the islands. Is it possible he did
not carry the constitution and flag with
him?" ;,

CLEVER YOUNG BOXERS TO MEET
BEFORE BAY CITY ATHLETIC CLUB
Eddie Hanlon, the Conqueror of Frank Neal and
Jockey Bennett, Will Defend His Laurels in the
Bantam Class From Joe Hill, a Hard Hitter
WHAT promises td be one of
the best cards Of boxing pre
sented by any of the minor
clubs this year is offered to
night by the Bay City Ath
letic Club. "The bouts will be held In Me
chanics' Pavilion Annex.
Chief interest centers about the meet
ing of Eddie Hanlon and Joe Hill,, a pair
of clever bantam-weights. Hanlon de
feated Frank Neal in a sensational fight
and some two weeks ago he gained the
decision over Jockev Bennett. This was
one of the fastest fights of the season..
HU1 has a record as a knockout fighter
and has built up quite a reputation
around the minor clubs.
Jockey Bennett will meet Jack McFad
den at 110 pounds.
Charley Rochette is to make his reap
pearance in the ring, meeting Frank
George.
Bobbie Johnson, one of the best of the
105-pound class, will' meet Kid Ryan, a
San Francisco Athletic Club product.
Jack Coyne and Toddy Everitt will fight
at 125 pounds and Joe Angeli and Dan Sul
livan at 120 pounds.

and James Griffin will act as Judge.
BRITT MAY BOX SIMMS.
Efforts Being Hade to Induce Him to
Turn Professional.
"Billy" Lavigne, matchmaker of the
Acme Athletic Club, Oakland, is striving
to match Art Simms, the clever Akron,
Ohio, boxer, and Jimmy Britt, amateur
champion lightweight of the Pacific Coast.
If proper inducements are made, Brilt
will forsake, the amateur ranks and try
to win fame in the pugilistic world. It is
thought the directors of the Olympic Club
will try and dissuade the boxer from turn
ing professional as they want him to rep
resent the club next year in the amateur
championship contests in New York. â¢
Simms is conceded to be one of the best
lightweights in the country. His record
is a brilliant one. Britt has proven In his
contests at the Olympic Club and par
ticularly in his private "go" with Terry
McGovern that he is made of the right
stuff* He has also boxed with Simms and
feels confident that he can take Art's

Clever Jockey Is Matched to Box
Johnny Crowell.
Jockey Winnie O'Connor will have a
long cherished ambition fulfilled Friday
night. He has been matched to box four
rounds with Johnny Crowell at 106 pounds
on the night Gardner and Carter meet for
their second fight. Crowell is a product of
the San Francisco Athletic Club and is
expected to make Winnie think the race
track an easier place to earn money than
the prize ring. . '
The fight between Gardner and Carter is
expected to prove a whirlwind affair.
Gardner is anxious to wipe out his defeat
by Walcott, while Carter has unpleasant
memories of the beating he received at
the hands of Gardner at their first meet
ing. Since then Carter has increased in
weight and improved noticeably in health.
His opponent ha3 also improved espe
cially in his boxing. He is quick to learn
and Alex Greggains has taught him a
number of useful blows. Both men are
known to be game and aggressive and the
fight can hardly go the full twenty
rounds.
The preliminaries are promising. In ad
dition to the O'Connor bout Billy Snail
ham, who has not been seen in the ring
in some months, will fight Tommy Gil
feather, ten rounds; Toby Irwin and Ar
thur Granfield are also matched for ten
rounds. Jim McDonald will referee the
big fight.

YOUNG WOMAN SWINDLER
IN WESTERN ADDITION
Gathers in Many Dollars Selling
Cheap Laces by Representing Them
as the Hand-Made Article.
Many ladies residing in the Western
Addition have been victimized during thÂ«r'
past few weeks by a young woman who
has been selling them what she declares
to be hand-made lace, but which upon
closer examination after the departure of
the vender is found to be nothing more
than" the machine-made article, and is
worth therefore considerably less than
the ladies have paid for it. The young
woman, whose name is unknown, is in
the habit of making house to house, calls
and asking for the lady of â¢ the house. To
the latter she displays her stock of laces,
which are carried in a satchel. She is
well dressed, glib of tongue and has been
generally successful in converting her al
leged hand-made laces into cash.
As an inducement to intending purchas
ers the young woman offers to Instruct
them at her home in the art of making
the pretty laces if they will buy more
than one dollar's worth. Then she gives
an address in the neighborhood of the
entrance to Golden Gate Park, which) has
in every instance proved to be fictitious.

Peters up, was third. There, were no
spills'" or accidents, and there is no rea
son why this branch of the -.sport should
not be popular as it is in" Australia and
Europe. The ring laid 4 to 1 against the
winning stable.
Perfect racing weather drew another
large, crowd, and while but two choices
drew down purses, there was little com
plaint about "reversals." Johnny Bull
man placed First Shot and Goldone over
the line first at lengthy odds, and Owen
Mounce distinguished himself by two
clever rides on Waterscratch, a 15 to 1
chance, and" later on with Position, a 7 to
5 favorite. *
Unfortunately the seven-furlong free
handicap was marred by a ragged start,
through no fault of Dick Dwyer. There
were only five starters, and RosonrVonde
in swerving prevented nearly all thefclth
ers from getting away with tire exception
of Byron Rose, the mild favorite. The
latter gelding led all the way and won
easily from Princess _T,itartia arid Rosor
monde.
First Shot, at 12 to 1, piloted by Bull
man, escaped most of the crowding- and
jostling in the opening sprint, beating Pat
Morrissey two lengths. - The latter would
have won beyond question. had Spencer
not been unfortunate enough to break a
stirrup. Midnight Chimes finished third.
Winnie O'Connor on Bedeck, favorite
for the mile selling run, suffered most in
a bumping match at the first turn, which
eventually cost him the race. Jim Hale,
a o\' 3 to 1 chance, looked to have every
thing his own way, when Bullman on
Goldone came on the second time, win
ning by a head in l-AO 1 /*. Bedeck ran a
close third. .
On his previous fine run 6 to 5 looked a
very fair price against .Jarretierre d'Or in
the netting on the five and a half furlong
sprint. . Buchanan, who had. the mount,
was last away, however, and lost some
what handily to Waterscratch, a 15 to 1
shot. Huachuca, at 40 to 1, showed a re
turn of form, running into the show a
length before Rosewar..
Last to be decided *aa a mile, and a
furlong selling number, which fell to Po
aition, the favorite. Coming from back in
the bunch the Racine horse turned up an
almost easy winner over Artilla and Com
mon wealth Attorney.

provide transportation facilities for 40,-
OOO men as soon as desired.
The Diarlo publishes a telegram from.
I,ondon to the effect" that the British
Government has addressed a telegraphic
communication to the Chilean and the
Argentine Governments offering its good
offices to bring aboht a settlement of all
existing difficulties between the two
countries. The British Government adds
that it takes this step at the instance of
Chile. â â -.-, â¢ â¢ â 
Telegrams received here from Santiago

SEAS STORM
THE LIFEBOATS
French Steamer Kleber
Goes Ashore Near
the Rhone.
PARIS, Dec. 17.â Dispatches received
from Marseilles announce that the French
steamer Kleber, from Cette, France, ia
ashore east of the mouth of the River
Rhone. The Kleber mistook the entrance
of the river during a heavy fog last Mon
day night.
During all of Tuesday lifeboats attempt
ed to assist the Kleber, but the heavy
seas prevented them from reaching her.
The customs boat from St. Louis du
Rhone succeeded in getting near the Kle
ber this morning and learned that the
captain of the ship was 111 and that the
mate had disappeared. It is supposed the
latter was swept overboard.
The Kleber lies 300 yards off shore. It
is feared she will become a wreck If the
weather does not moderate. The Kleber
carried a crew*! fifty-two men. Her
rudder and steriFposts have been carried
away. The latest dispatches from Mar
seilles say the wind ia now changing, and
hopes are entertained that the vessel may
be floated to-morrow.
OCEAN CITY. N. J.. Dec. 17.â The Brit
ish bark Syndia, which went ashore in
the northeaster on Sunday morning, will
prove a total loss. This afternoon ohe
broke in two and has been abandoned by
the wreckers. The vessel and cargo are
valued at nearly $500,000.
BOSTON. Dec. 17.â The British steam
ship Isle of Kent of Newcastle. England,
from Savannah for. Bremen, put In here
to-day with her bows crushed in and her
stem battered. She brought the entire
crew of the Spanish steamer Amestl
bound from Bilbao, Spain, for Philadel
phia, the latter vessel having sunk In a.
half-hour after a collision with the Isle
of Kent on Saturday last when about 328
miles east of Cape Cod. The collision oc
curred early In the morning. Each of the
lookouts sighted the other vessel, but too
late to prevent the accident. The Isle of
Kent cut half-way through the Amestl so
that she began to ftll immediately.

Three Months of the New Scientific

Baldness Is caused by dandruff, which
Is caused by a germ. Kill the germ and
there 1b almost certainty that hair will
grow again,. If the follicle has not been
totally destroyed. Nels Peterson of Lime

master, John F. Damon as senior warden
and Archibald C. Brower as junior war
den, but the master and junior warden
being suddenly called away from the city
the grand master on November 8, 1855,
named William S. Moses as master and
John Hunter as junior warden, and eight
days later the lodge was duly organized.
William S. Moses, a charter member and
who is No. 1 on the roll of membership,
served the lodge as its master for three
consecutive years, being the only one who
has ever had that, honor. There are oth
ers who have served three terms in the
lodge, but the service was not consecu
tive. The membership roll, which now
contains 231 names, shows those of many
of the prominent and well-known citizens
of the community, while the roster from
early . days shows the names of many
who were among the leading citizens of
the '50's. Among those Installed last night
was John d'Arcy, the tyler, who entera
upon the sixteenth year of continuous ser
vice in that office.

ROOT REPLIES
IN SHARP WORDS
Secretary of War Will
Not Delay the Cuban
Election.
Politicians of the Island ( Are
Told to Observe the
Laws, a V .
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.â Secretary of
War Root has addressed a letter to Sli
dele A. Plerra, the representative of the
Maso party In Cuba,- "who is at present
in this city, denying his request for a
postponement of the Cuban elections. Sec
retary Root's letter, which is dated De
cember 16, is as follows: ,
Sir: The application for postponement of
the Cuban election presented by you on Sat
urday December 14, in behalf of the supporters
of General Maso, as a candidate for President
of Cuba has been careiully considered. The
effect oÂ£ granting; the application would be to
prolong American occupation and postpone the
independence of Cuba and the control of the
island by the government of her own people.
This ought not to be done in the interest of
any candidate or without the most weighty and
substantial reasons. The substance of reasons
which you present is that the central board of
scrutiny as now constituted. Is composed of
gentlemen none of whom is in favor of Gen
eral Maso. and all of whom are In favor of
General Palma*. and you | declare that that
board is unfair and will be unfair in the per
formance of its duties. .'
The board to which you refer was consti
tuted without ' reference to any candidate and
before any candidates had been named. It
consisted of the president and four of the dis
tinguished members of the Constitutional Con
vention elected by the people of Cuba to pro
vide for the establishment of the new govern
ment. It had the approval of the convention
and of the people whom the convention rep
resented. Since the board was thus constituted
candidates for the Presidency have been nom
inated and it happens that you' and your
friends have nominated a candidate- who has
no adherent on the board. That furnishes no
ground for turning the board out of office or
for postponing the election and overturning the
election machinery carefully provided by the
representatives of the Cuban people in conven
tion assembled, and establishing new machinery
for the purpose of putting adherents of your
candidate into office. If such a course were
adopted new nominations would require nÂ«w
postponements and rearrangements and an elec
tion might be indefinitely postponed. It Is a
false theory of official responsibility which as
sumes that gentlemen placed in conspicuous
positions of public trust. will be guilty of of
ficial malfeasance because they may personally
prefer one candidate rather than another.
As to the assertion that the central board of
scrutiny has in fact proved to be unfair, some
thing besldeÂ» mere assertion is necessary. No
facts are stated by you to sustain thl3 assertion
except that you allege that an illegal selection
of delegates to a provincial board of canvassers
has been approved, but you state that there was
a failure to post a list of taxpayers, which the-
Clty Council of Havana ought to have posted
on the 29th of October. This was not the busi
ness of the central board of scrutiny. I am
informed, moreover, by cable from Havana that
the list in question was posted ,on the 30th of
October The single day's delay could not have
occasioned you or your associates the slightest
Injury or Inconvenience, and an objection based
upon it is in the highest degree technical. While
I do not for a moment suppose that you intend
any such result, I cannot avoid the conviction
that your request calls upon the United States
for the very interference with the Cuban elec-'
tion which your associates have deprecated and
which it is cur duty and purpose to avoid. Tour
application must, accordingly, be denied.
CHARGED WITH ABUSE OF
FEEBLE-MINDKD CHILD
Secretary White of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children states
that a case of exceptional brutality was
reported to him yesterday as existing at
the home of G. W.- Nlelson, 1121 Fell
street. It was alleged that a feeble-mind
ed son was kept tied up in the cellar,and
was brutally beaten by his parents.
Officer McMurray visited the Nielsan
home and found the little fellow in the
back yard with his hands tied tight be
hind him. s Whether the boy was kept in
the cellar he could not learn from the
parents, although he states that the
neighbor's substantiate the charge. He
released the child and ordered that he be
treated humanely in the future.
Secretary White says that he shall at
tempt to have' the boy placed in the asy
lum at Eldrldge, although the institution
is now overcrowded and the greatest dif
ficulty is experienced in having new
charges admitted.

THE MERCHANT MARINE.
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that the merchant marine bill introduced by
Senator Frye is not wholly satisfacSfcy even
to those who are most eager to provide for the up
building of American shipping. The correspondent
of the Boston Transcript says that Senator Frye him
self "has made no? secret of his dislike, relatively
speaking, of the " present bill, or of the fact that
his aim in drafting it was to secure something
which would quiet the opposition of Western Repub
licans in the House and Senate, and so make a start
upon subsidy legislation."
While such reports are somewhat discouraging,
they are by no means so bad as they sound. The
proposed legislation is something like a new depar
ture in American politics. It is natural, therefore,
that differences of opinion exist as to what are the
best means of providing for an increase of our ocean
going merchant marine, and also as to what would
be the effects of adopting any particular measure.
Those differences can be harmonized only by experi
ment in the practical operation of the shipping law.
Experience soon shows wherein any legislation is
effective and wherein it is deficient," In this, as in
everything else, we must learn' to do by doing. We
can never build up our merchant fleets and fit them
for competition with the subsidized lines of Europe
if we follow the policy of "hanging our^clothes on" a
hickory limb and never going near the water." The
only way by which we can get a perfected system of
legislation on the subject is to enact the best we can
devise to start with, and then amend it from time to
time as occasion demands and experience proves
best. rV' Â£'';':â¢:"â¢
The delay of Congress in dealing with this feature
of our commercial needs has reached the point of
dilly dally. Year after year, in Congress after* Con
gress, we have had nothing but delay. In the mean
time our foreign commerce has expanded to a mag
nitude which compels us to pay an enormous tribute
to the foreign ship-owners who carry it. In his re
cent address at the banquet of* the Massachusetts
Association Senator Hanna estimated that trib
ute at $200,000,000 a year.
The evil of depending upon foreign ships for carry
ing our exports and imports was pointed out by
Senator Hanna in the statement: "England has
taken her ships' from us and used them in carrying
troops and munitions of war to South Africa, while
the ore is lying on our docks awaiting transporta
tion, with no ships to send it in.- From October 1,
1899, to June 30, 1900, 173 steamers cleared Boston
for Europe with 639,555 tons. The total exports on
all were valued at $79,000,090. During the correspond
ing period in the previous year the clearings for
England were 258 steamers of 958,677 tons. The
total valuation of the exports was $101,000,000. The
loss to Boston was the difference between these
amounts. If that was true of Boston it was true of
TCew York and of every seaport in the United
If the transfer of British shipping to meet the
emergency of a comparatively small war like that in
the Transvaal has caused so great a loss to our com
merce as that specified by the Senator, it is easy to
foresee that if Great Britain became involved iri a
war with some great nation like Germany the loss to
ourselves would be enormous. Our industries are
becoming more and more dependent upon our for
eign trade, and if that trade were interfered with the
home market would "j be glutted with . surplus
products' and the whole country would suffer.
We need an American marine adequate to the re
quirements of our commerce. We cannot obtain such
a marine unless we are willing to pay for it. Ship
building in the United States is 25 per cent higher
than in Europe, the operation of ships at American
wages is 22 per cent higher than European ships,
and, moreover. Europe pays $28,000,000 annually in
subsidies. That is the situation. The Republican
party is pledged to promote our merchant .marine.
It is high time the pledge were kept.
THE *SAN FRANCISCO GAiL,:WEDNESDAY v DECEMBER 18,31901.
THE AFFAIR CUBAN
IT is announced that General Wood has returned to his, post in Cuba, declaring that
Â£ the island is to have the tariff abatement ami abolition which its planters and cap-,
italists demand of this country. This demand is free admission of sugar and a 50
per cent abatement on the tobacco rate. Free sugar means the closing of most of
the beet sugar mills and crippling of the rest, in this country and obsoletion of the cane
plantations of Louisiana and on the Brazos in Texas.
Americans have investments in sugar and* tobacco plantations in Cuba, but Amer
icans also have about $40,000,000 invested in beet sugar plants in this country ..* and as
much more in tobacco. They may not be as compactly organized as the Cuban capital
ists, but they will be heard from if it prove that General Wood's prophecy have any
foundation. \ The present and future prosperity of the American people- has its chief value
in its diffusion, inMts generality, inits prevalence, in every. interest having a share in it.
The economic philosophy of Mr. McKinley was deeper than that of Clay's American
system. Mr. Clay's analysis never achieved the detail and never traced the policy of pro
tection to the store in every pocket, the fire on every hearth and the food on every table,
as did that of McKinley. â¢
The McKinley policy contemplated the domestication here, of every form of pro
duction, manual, mechanical and agricultural,' that Â»was; not barred by physical condi
tions. He believed in the variety and the vigor of American capacity, and proposed that
its exercise should be invited by a variety of occupations commensurate with its diver
sified powers. With, that capacity in full exercise and addressed to all occupations, and
engaged in all productions that can supply the complex wants of man, he looked upon
the total result as evidence of general prosperity. He also believed that to put any part
of the complex operation out of action meant injury to the whole. Obsoleting any one
form of production by destroying its profit meant so much dead matter in the indus
trial body. â  â  ,' .'â ,
In pursuance of this theory and policy he domesticated here the manufacture of
tin, of plate glass, pearl buttons, beet sugar and a score of other industries. The Agricul
tural Department under his organization and impulse proceeded at, once to explore the
world for useful trees, plants and vines, with which to diversify the field, fiber and fruit
crops of the country to make the'profits of the farmer more secure by making him more
independent of accident to a single crop. Therefore, we have the Smyrna fig product
firmly planted jn California, and also the date about to occupy thousands of acres in our
deserts, and new legumes and forage plants introduced to fertilize the soil and add to its
profits. \ '*'â '
What Americans need is to comprehend the wholeness, the unity, the oneness of
this remarkable system which gives to every hand gainful occupation according to its
training and to every man opportunity according to his genius.
But the integrity of the system depends upon^the presence of each of its parts. It'
is a beautiful arch, impressing us with its. benefits, and, by its strength and power, inspir
ing the awe of the world. But take out its keystone, or a single stone anywhere, and its
curve is spoiled and its strength gone. The removal of a single unit which enters into
the structure should be resisted. We make no : partisan issue. There is no middle
ground between this system of perfect protection and that of free trade. A frank free
trader like Cleveland or Carlisle commands respect. He is understood. He has a phil
osophy, and, carrying out the reasoning of Cobden, he is for free trade because in his
philosophy, though it be false, and by his reasoning, though it be illogical, free trade is for
the benefit of his own countrymen. At the other extreme is the protection advocated by
McKinley, for the benefit of Americans. Each system pleading the same motive, and
free trade therefore deserving of respect, albeit not justified by experience.
Between these two extremes of economic philosophy lie the policies innominata,
with no relation to either, originating in the passing purpose of some class or group of
individuals who put their personal profit against general prosperity. They want -to re
move a stone here and there from the arch, for their own gain, and the spoiled curve does
not impress them. They always come with some specious plea: Just now they are trying
to impress American sympathy by crying out that when we declared' war against Spain
we promised stable prosperity to Cuba, and it is our duty to injure ourselves now by free
trade with that island in order that it may not have a panic! '
.â¢ This plea is false. We assumed no such obligation.. The claim is fantastic. The
economic structure built by McKinley must stand. It has but one logical opponent and
that is the free trader. When it falls let him build his Utopia on its ruins. But mean
time let the innominata, the mongrel, the anonymous, welter in the greed that
begets them.
OUR TRADE WITH CHINA
f^PECIAL COMMISSIONER ROCKHILL'S
report of the 'results of the negotiations at Pe-
king has just been submitted to Congress.
From the summary which has been telegraphed, jit
appears the report makes an excellent showing for
American diplomacy. By reason of our action in op
posing and eventually mitigating the severity of the
extreme demands originally made by several of the
European powers we have gained the friendship of
Chinese officials and may expect that friendship to
manifest itself in favorable concessions to American
trade".
It happens that the submission of this report to
Congress coincides with the publication of the Treas
ury Bureau of Statistics showing that American com
merce with China suffered more during the disturb
ances of the past year than that of any other country.
Just why it should be so in view of the earnestness
with which American officials were protecting China
from her enemies is not clear, but the facts are un
mistakable. They appear in the official figures of the
Chinese Government, and it would seem, therefore,
that trade does not follow the lines of national grati
tude. .
The report of the Bureau of Statistics says: "Im
ports into China from Great Britain in 1900 exceeded
those of 1899 by more than five million Haikwan taels,
those from Russia increased a million Haikwan "taels,
those from Turkey in Asia, Persia, Egypt, Algiers,
etc., showed "a considerable increase, and those from
Continental Europe, a slight increase; while from the
United States the imports fell from 22,288,745 Haik
wan taels in 1899 to 16,724,493 in This was a re
duction in imports from the United . States of about
25 per cent, while the United Kingdom showed an
increase of more than 10 per cent, Russia more than
25 per" cent, the Asiatic countries above mentioned 40
The United States condemned Spain for ill-treat
ing Cuba, Germany condemns the United States for
grabbing the Philippines, France . condemns Ger
many for oppressing the Poles, Great Britain con
demns France for invading Tonquin, .while . Spain
pops up^to join in the condemnation of Great Britain
for the war in South Africa; and thus do the people
of- each of the great powers prove themselves
champions of liberty and friends of the oppressed.
It has been stated that the German tariff bill now
under consideration was drawn up as a hit at the
United States, but now it is reported that: Russia
threatens Germany with reprisals if the bill passed,
so it appears the bill has a back action movement and
menaces the fellow, behind Germany much more than
the one in front.

per cent, and Continental Europe a slight increase."
An examination of the details of. the import trade
of China during 1900 as compared with previous
years makes the showing for us even worse than ap
pears in the general statement. The largest imports
into China from the United States consist of cotton
goods and kerosene. These come into competition
with British, Dutch and Japanese cotton fabrics and
with Russian and Sumatran kerosene. The 'figures
received by the bureau show that in cotton drills the
imports of English goods fell from 78,887 pieces in
1899 to 69,047 in 1900, a reduction of less than 10,000
pieces; that the imports of Dutch drills increased
from 40,170 pieces in 1899 to 44,624 in 1900; but that
those of American drills fell from 1,626,107 pieces in
1899 to 805,892 in 1900, a reduction of more than one
half in American goods; while those from England
showed a reduction of less than 15 per cent, and those
from the Netherlands an actual gain of more than
10 percent. Kerosene oil importations 'of the Ameri
can product fell from 40,724,989 gallons to 34,447,112
gallons, a decrease of more than six million gallons;
that from Russia fell from 35,695,116 to 32,708,757
gallons, a decrease of about 3,000,000 gallons; while
that from Sumatra showed an increase of over 4,006,
000 gallons, the figures for, Sumatran oil being, for
1899 11,993,202 gallons, and for 1900 16,424,155.
It will be seen from these figures that the diplo
matic work done by Commissioner Rockhill has been
more beneficial to China than to us. We have made
friends among Chinese officials, while Europe has
made customers mong the merchants- It is possible,
of course, :that the effects of our diplomacy will be
more fully felt in the years to come and that we will
from this time on gain instead of lose in the Chinese
trade. At any rate there is large room for improve
ment/ :-, : .-.. â¢ . - ;

or Rockwell and Constantine held forth a
steady stream of men has appeared daily
since the advertisement was started, and
at the office at 20 O'Farrell street dozens
of applicants have been seen by the
schemers.
â¢To those who called at the lodgins
nouse the information was given by Con
stantine that Rockman was in the "inner
office," after a bellboy had told the callers
to go to rooms 19 and 20, instead of room
106.
In the inner office" Rockman explained
nis plan of work. He claimed to have a
compound to make whisky with the aid
of alcohol and water.
He asked each applicant for $50 for a
copy of the recipe, and to those who in
vestigated Rockman said:
The Government officials never think of in-
Epecting the contents of bottles in saloons.
This compound costs $1 50 a quart. A little
of.lt added to a half pint of alcohol and three
pints or water .will make a fine whisky..
The schemers would try to sell the
recipe, saying the purchaser would make
money by doing business with saloon men.
At the office at 20 O'Farrell street Rock
man has. tried to sell his "recipe" for use
in the Hawaiian Islands and the Philip
pines. He was In the office yesterday, and
Moore was in charge during the evening.
aloore when questioned told an -evasive
story as to his dealings with Rockman,
and claimed to be in the oil business, but
admitted that he was "dickering" for the
purchase of Rockman's "business."
The internal revenue agents and the lo
cal detective officers are likely to take a
hand in the affairs of the schemers if the
latter remain in San Francisco.
CAVAGNAHO'S WINE VAULTS
ENTEBED BY BUBGLARS
Front Door Forced Open With a Jim
my and Liquor and Money-
Stolen.
The police were notified yesterday that
the premises of F. Cavagnaro, wine mer
chant,- 608 Montgomery street, were en
tered by burglars Sunday morning. En
trance was effected by forcing open a
door leading from Montgomery street
with a "jimmy," wjiich the burglars left
on the bar.' It is marked with the letter
"M."
The burglars helped themselves to the
drinks and took with them six bottles of
whisky and a bottle of wine. It is sup
posed that they knew where Cavagnaro
kept his money, as they found $147 U5
which he had hidden on the drain board
under the bar.
Movements of Transports.
The Warren left Manila on the 15th
inst. and should reach here the middle
of next month. She has aboard Generals
Funston and Hughes and a. number of
time-expired men.
The Thomas should have been here yes
terday, but as the Coptic brought news
that she was to call to Kobe and Yoko
hama on the way the chances are that it
will be Thursday before she gets in.
The Sheridan is to sail December 31, so
while the crew will have Christmas day
ashore they . will spend New Year's day
at sea. Anyhow, Uncle Sam has made
ample provisions for the new year, so
nobody aboard the Sheridan will suffer.
Work on the Sherman and Logan is
progressing and both vessels will proba
bly be ready for service In January.
The Inveramsay Arrives.
The British ship Inveramsay made port
yesterday. She had an ordinary passage
until the latitude of Pitcairn was
reached. There a storm raged and the
ship was hove to. Finally the gale sub
elded and the islanders came off with
fruit and vegetables. Everybody was well
on the island and the descendants of the
mutineers of the Bounty seemed happy
and contented. Off the Karallones the
Inveramsay met with baffling winds which
delayed her arrival several days.
The Inveramsay carries 2S00 tons of coal
and is consigned to Balfour, Guthrie &
Co.

TEACHER'S GOLD
PREVENTS TRIAL
Professor Knowlton Un
able to Talk When
on the Stand.
Owing to a severe throat cold which is
afflicting Professor Ebenezer Knowlton
the investigation of the charges of incom
petency made against him by Albert Ly
ser, principal of the John Swett Grammar
School, was abruptly terminated yester
day, morning after being under, way for
fifteen minutes. Knowlton's voice gave
out, and despite the ministration of lozen
ges offered by School Director Mrs. Kin
caid and the expressed sympathy of
friend and foe he could not make himself
; heard without great effort.
School Director Denman was put upon
the stand when the session began, and
Attorney McPike opened the defense for
Knowlton by his examination of Denman.
The latter testified that he had lived In
"San Francisco for fifty years and that for
thirty-five years he was connected with
the school department, during which time
he knew Professor Knowlton. Soon after
this McPike struck a snag.
"What is your opinion of Professor
Knowlton as an educator?" asked Mc-
Pike.
Denman pondered over the question, fin
ally* resolving that it was not a fair one,
as he was sitting as a judge during the
investigation. Director Casserly could see
no reason why the question should not be
answered, but Mrs. Kincaid did. She said
that while Professor Knowlton might
have been a Tery good teacher in his day
he might also be very inefficient at the
present time. Denman was not pressed
to answer.
The case will reopen on Thursday, when
it is expected that Judges Sloss and
Dunne, Albert Scott, Alfred Roncovieri
and Abe Ruef will testify in favor' of
Knowlton.
Knowlton testified as to the length of
time he has been a teacher. Then he was
seized by a fit of whispers.
STORM ON COAST PASSES.
Belated Vessels Now Have Chance t>
Reach Port.
Captains of steamships now arriving
say the storm off the Oregon coast has
passed. Captain Hall of the collier Edith
and Captain Seaman of the Czarina both
say they had a most enjoyable trip from
the Sqund. On no occasion were the ves
sels in danger, and the seas on! Flattery
and the Columbia River were no more
heavy than usual. Captain Hall said:
I don't think there is any doubt that the
Matteawan and all hands are gone. One of her
boats, some of her fire buckets and the medi
cine chest were washed ashore. -I Investigated
the matter and know what I am talking about.
The â wreckage was most assuredly from the
Matteawan and 1 think she went ashore and
did not go down. All colliers carry 200 tons
less in winter than they do In summer. This
doeB not seem very much to a landsman, but it
elves the vessel eight inches more freeboard
and every sailor knowa what that means.
Now the Matteawan was eight Inches more
out of the water when she struck the gale than
when she left the Sound last November. There
fore I think she was perfectly seaworthy. Some
thing must have happened to her steering gear
and the was driven ashore. Had she gone down
there would never have been anything hear<3
Irom her.

FISH COMMISSION PATROL VESSEL
ALBATROSS LOSES FELINE MASCOT
CREW OF THE UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSIONER'S" STEAMSHIP ALBATROSS LEAVING THE VESSEL
WITH THE REMAINS OF "JERRY," THE MASCOT, FOR INTERMENT IN THE SAILORS' PLAT ON MA
RIN'S SHORE. A BRASS BAND ACCOMPANIED THE PROCESSION.
THE mascot of the Fish Commis
sioners'steamer Albatross is dead.
"Jerry" was known from one end
of the Alaskan coast to the other.
and many a choice piece of salmon
did ho eat in his day. For seventeen
years the cat was the favorite of the
crew, and when he died of old age Mon
day the men decided to bury him among
the Bailors of the fleet. ,
Yesterday the crew, to the number of
twenty-eight, received leave of absence,
and at once went ashore and secured a
brass band. Then they went back to the
ship and asked for the use of the long-.
boat. The body of "Jerry," suitably
draped and in a regulation shaped coffin,
was passed down, and : there was not a
"jack" in the boat who did not drop a
tear over the coffin.
When the shore was reached the crowd
disembarked and the cortege headed for
the cemetery. The band played the dead
march from "Saul," and when the sailor's
grave was reached the boatswain 1 pro
nounced a eulogy over the cat and the in
terment was over.
Of all the cats that ever served under
Uncle Sam's llag "Jerry" was perhaps the
most famous. Once his dismal catcalls
drew attention to the fact that the ship
was in danger. A hail to the lookout
showed that an iceberg was on the port
quarter. During a southeaster a sailor
fell overboard and the cat by Its frantic
actions drew the attention of the officer
on duty and a life buoy was thrown,
which proved the salvation of the jack
tar. ,
Whenever there was a festal occasion,
either ashore -or afloat, "Jerry" was al
ways there, and whether in the officers'
mess or in the sailors' quarters he was
equally at home. His death came as a
surprise, as Sunday last he was in good
health, but old age was telling on him.
Monday "Jerry" was taken sick, and in
spite of the skill of a veterinary he died.
Over his grave the Albatross men have
placed a tablet on which is inscribed:
JERRY,
Who is Reincarnated.
An Humble Friend and Wise Counselor,
Who Never Forsook a Friend Nor
Mistook an Enemy.
Requiescat in Pace.

Mail advices from New York say:
"Â£&isi*ta continue very unsettled, crices for
loose Muscatels and seeded still being' with
held by the Eeeding combine on the coast. The
new Quotations are exaected any hour, how
ever, end pending their announcement the
cpot market is very quiet, dealers all asking
high prices. The raisin situation on the coast
is etill gaining etrength steadily, and the opin
ion now appears generally held that the
"High Five" packers have virtual possession
of the 6tocks of all sorts of raisins in Califor
nia. This belief and the expectation of a coast
jjrice of around 7Â®7%c for fancy seeded has
led to a very strong teeling among local hold
ers, and it was difficult to buy any quantity
of loose or seaded yesterday in any quarter of
the market. Bids of 5%c for 3-crown loose
were made to a number of dealers and de
clined. A Email lot sold at 5%c, but at the
close most holders were very firm at 6c. Coast
6Â«eded are hard to quote, but nominally are
from 7?i@Sc.
â¢ â¢Purchases of all the remaining stocks of
Sultanas and seedless Muscatel raisins on the
< oast by Association packers have resulted In
\erv much higher prices for both varieties,
both in California and on the epot. Unbleached
Sultanas have advanced from 5c to 5%c. f. o.
I)., coast, while the local market is now firm
at a rise to 0%c. A number of offers of
i^j.5Â«4cT coast, for Sultanas in car lots were
turned down yesterday, but one car was re
portel confirmed by an outside packer at 5%c.
Tfce total quantity of Sultanas included In the
coast deal is stated to be anywhere from 30
to 60 cars. The seedless Muscatels, according
to reecrts. were about 200 tons. Seedless are
not in very large supply here. The market is
tiacidedly higher, but hard to quote.
"Currants continue very strong on spot. The
Greek market Is still advancing, due, it is re
ported, to good buying by England and the
Continent. Sales for prompt 6hipment from
Greece per Manin have been made in this
market at 16s 3d. and one report says as high
as 16s 6d has already been paid. Amelias to
r.rrive in three or four days are offered at
fcvtc whlle soods idue about Christmas per
direct steamer are' selling In a fair way at
â¢'Date* are higher. Prunes are firm on the
cr,ast for lanre size Santa Claras at 3%c A
verv few 40-50s can still be bought at %c
less. The four sizes are held from a 3%@3%c
basis. Outside nrunes are at a 3c basis and
Oregcns mostly at a 2c price."
The Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. G. McAfiie. section
director of the climate and crop service of the
â \Veather Bureau, says:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
Abnormally low temperatures have prevailed
throughout the State during the week, with
tenerally clear weather. Minimum tempera
tures cf 20, 22 and up to 30 and 32 degrees
are reported in the interior and portions of
Southern California. Killing frosts have oc
curred In all sections. Light showers have
fallen In the south.
Northerly winds and sunshine have dried out
the soil in those northern counties where the
late rains were heavy, enabling farmers to re- :
tame work in the fields. Plowing and seeding
continue in most sections, but rain is needed
In the southern districts before the work can
toe finished The growth of grain has been
somewhat retarded by cool weather, but no
damage has been done by frost, and prospects
ere good for an increased acreage and large
crops. Green feed Is plentiful and has not
L^en seriously damaged by frost.
Ample warnings were given the Trait-grow
ers, and in orchards where fire baskets and
rmudging were resorted to there was probably
but little damage to citrus fruits. Toung
orange and lemon trees were Injured In some
sections, and tender vines and plants killed.
The cold weather has been beneficial to decidu
ous trees and vineyards. Pruning is pro
gressing.
Bacramento Valley. â Cool weather has pre
vailed during the week, and killing frosts have
occurred in all sections. No rain has fallen.
Northerly winds and sunshine have dried out
the ground In places where the late rainfall
â was heavy, and farmers have resumed plow-
Ing and seeding. Grain is in excellent condi
tion, and is too far advanced to be damaged
by frost. Green feed is still abundant and
etock are in good condition. Tender vegetables
tvfre damaged by frost in some places. The
cool weather has been beneficial In checking:
T-remature budding of fruit trees, and orchards
and vineyards are In good condition. The
rainfall at this date is eomewhat less than
the average, and more rain is needed soon in
some sections.
Coast and Bay Sections. â Unusually cold
weather has prevailed during the week, and
killing frosts nave been frequent in nearly all
sections. Minimum temperatures are reported
as follows: Healdsburg, 28 degrees; Hollister,
22 degrees; Peachland. 26 degrees; Upper Lake,
26 degrees. Garden vegetables were killed In
eorne place?, and In the vicinity of San Luis
Obispo nranfres and lemons in exposed places
â were damaged. Grain and green feed were
not Injured and are in good condition. Plow
ing and seeding are progressing, but more
rain is needed in the southern counties before
this work can be completed. The cold weather
has been beneficial to orchards and vineyards.
TreÂ» and vine pruning are In progress.
San Joaquin Valley. â The weathrr during the
tveek has been generally clear and cold, and
eoveral killing frosts have occurred in all
ecctions. At Bakerpflefld on the 11th there was
b. trace of rain, followed by a light fall of hall
and snow. The minimum temperature for four
days at Visalia was 22 degrees, and many
places through the valley report minimum
temperatures of from 24 to 30 degrees. Ample
warnings had been given, and citrus fruits and
young orange trees were not seriously injured
In orchards where smudging was reported to.
Grain and feed continue In good condition an-1
rave not been damaged by frost, although
prowth has been somewhat retarded. In 6ome
ft the southern districts the rainfall has been
insufficient, and plowing and seeding are pro
pressing slowly, but in other sections this
work is being done as rapidly as possible.
C'rchardists and vlneyardlsts are pruning.
Southern California.â Clear, cold weather has
prevailed during the werk. and killing frosts
have occurred in many places. Temperatures
e* low as 20 degrees are reported In some
ructions. Oranges have undoubtedly been
damaged, but to what extent is not yet known.
.Ample warnings were given and emudglng and
Tire baskets did excellent sen-ice. The orange
<rop is reported as ripening rapidly and pick-
Ing and shipping are in progress. Young citrus
tree* and tender vines and vegetables were in
jured by the frost. I/.Â«?ht rain fell In some sec
tion* on the 11th. Grain and feed are In good
condition, but need rain. Plowing and seeding
Ere progressing elowly. owing to lack of rain
Eureka Summary. â Cold weather somewhat
retarded the growth of grans and grain If it
<*<Â»>* not rain plowing will be resumed this
v**k. There have been no reports of material
<Jamage by frost.
Los Angeles Summary. â CoM, dry week
heavy to killing frort in the latter part'
vegetable crops were badly Injured or killed'
SomÂ« oranges on low ground damaged also
lemons: It Ik thought citrus fruits escaped se
rious iniury. Ample warnings were plven*
fmudsrlnr Reneral. Frost was favorable for
Â«WiduouR trees, which were blooming nrc
raaturely. %

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 17.â The undertone of the
stock market was decidedly firmer to-day,
'growing in strength as the day progressed, and
the closing was fairly strong, with notable net
gains In a number of prominent stocks. The
speculation was almost entirely professional
and was repressed in its nature with a disposi
tion to caution about encroaching on the lim
ited money supply. Amalgamated Copper
maintained its dominant Influence on the mar
ket, and its Incessant fluctuations bad some
sympathetic influence, but the Influence was
more marked on the upward range of prices
and the gains established in the general mar
ket were yielded stubbornly when Amalga
mated Copper reacted. That stock touched 60 %
soon after the opening, a decline from yes
terday's closing and record low level of 1%.
The raw copper market in London was report
ed weak and shares of copper companies eveiy
where were depressed. Some violent declines
were reported from the best on Stock Ex
change. Opinion as to the next dividend con
tinued pessimistic, most favorable forecast of
Thursday's action naming a 1 per cent divi
dend. The recovery in the stock was appar
ently based on the rally in the raw copper mar
ket In London. This rally extended further in
futures, which were also more largely dealt
In than in spot, thus Increasing the premium
on futures deliveries of copper, which devel
oped yesterday for the first time in almost
three months. Amalgamated touched 64%, and
after numerous fluctuations below that point
closed at 63%. a net gain of 1%. The money
market was very quiet, .reflecting the cautious
tone of the speculation. Call loans ruled at 6
per cent untii late In the day, when the placing
of a residue carried the rate lower. Sterling
exchange was called strong, but foreign bank
ers express the opinion that there is no likeli
hood of further gold going out before January
1. The transcontinental stocks were prominent
for strength, and apparently thrived on the
passage of the isthmian canal treaty. The ar
gument for a permanent injunction in a suit
to restrain the retirement of Northern Pacific
preferred had no effect on them, and they rose
in the face of somewhat alarming reports of
rate-cutting among Western railroads Included
In the "community of interest," which were
apparently intended for other than Wall-street
consumption. Cuts In the price of petroleum,
sugar.lead and linseed oil had a depressing ef
fect on securities of companies in those trades.
The Pressed Steel Car stocks were heavy on
reports of an opposition company to be or
ganized. A very active demand for tie South
ern Railway stocks developed late -n Jie day
and helped to make the close strong. A re
covery of 4 points in Rubber Goods preferred
and a further rise of 3 points In Long Island
were features.
The bond market was moderately actlve'anJ
irregular. Total sales (par value), $2,630,000.
United States coupon threes advanced % and
the refunding twos % per cent.

there was little" influence from this factor at
the opening. On these influences and, a very
dull show for business May opened %Â®V4c to
a shade lower at 7l)@79%c. There was lit
tle to be had at this dip, however, and on
a smull outside â * demand and some short cov

that the - Kansas crop would be damaged by

was a good show of late activity. St. Louts

International Sugar Con
ference Does Impor
tant Work.
Attitude of the United States
Fuzzles the Dele
gates.
BRUSSELS, Dec. IT.â A communication
to the press announces that the interna
tional sugar conference, at its meeting to
day, discussed the effects of high^eustoms
surtaxes on sugar. The indications are
i hat the delegates, who represent all the
countries of Europe excen.t Russia, favor
jvo total abolition of sugar bounties in
Â¦ Â¦ co , u Â» trl es represented. The delegates
nad pledged themselves to abstain from
making any communication to the press
but this much was given out in connection
with to-day's sitting.
The main point of to-day's debate was
the imposition of countervailing duties
and a discussion of the effect which the
imposition of such duties by the United
States might have in diverting the export
of bounty-fed sugar to fresh markets, and
thus generally upsetting the general sys
tem of bounty-paying duties.
The conference is doubtful of the effi
ciency of any action which it may take
in view of the fact that the United States
;i!id Russia are not bound by the dictum
of the conference. The result may be to
i-all another conference, to include the
countries which are not at present repre
sented.
CLAIMS HIS ARREST
IS CAUSED BY SPITE
X. F. Alexander Charged With Lar
ceny by Man. to Whom He
Sold Ranch.
M. F. Alexander, one of the pioneer cit
izens of this city, was arrested last night
at his home. 320 Pixley â¢ avenue, on a
charge of grand larceny. He was taken
into custody on a warrant issued in Con
tra Costa County.
Alexander, who has always borne a
good reputation, is believed to be the vic
tim of petty spite, and the circumstances
surrounding the case seem to bear out
fhls belief.
I Some months ago Alexander sold a
ranch near Mount Diablo to a man named
A bell, the latter paying $3000 on the prop
erty and giving Alexander a mortgage on
the ranch for $2000. The purchaser and
his wife moved to the place during the
month of September and lived there with
Alexander and his wife until recently,
when Alexander moved to this city.
In packing up two old jumpers, a few
towels and several other minor personal
effects became mixed with Alexander's
belongings, and for taking these away
A bell swore to a complaint charging Alex
ander with grand larceny.
Several of the attaches of the prison,
including: Turnkey Coogan and Prison
keeper Dick Bidwell. know Alexander's
reputation for honesty, and they inter
ested themselves in his behalf. Warrant
Clerk T. I. Fitzpatrick took the responsi
bility of releasing Alexander on $100 cash
bail. Alexander claims that Abell is try
ing; to get him into trouble so he can get
out of i raying the mortgage on the ranch.
MANY PEOPLE IN DANGER
FROM LIVE ELECTRIC WIRE
Trolley Line Parts on Eddy Street.
Near Powell, Causing Several
Slight Accidents.
An accident thai fortunately was not
attended with loss of life occurred on
Eddy street, near Powell, yesterday aft
ernoon, when a trolley line burned
feet of live wire fell into
-nter of the street. As the line fell
: the City Transfer wagons driven
. Sumerseu was crossing the car
track. The wire struck between Somei
nd his team, cutting the lines from
ands and burning into the wagon
tocgue. The driver was thrown back
ward by the force of the shock and the
I dashed up Eddy street, overturn
ing and smashing three other vehicles
their way. William Good
win, who was driving one of the buggl<=?
which the runaway team overturned, was
m to the pavement, but escaped with
â¢ ere sprain of the hand and arm.
while the trouble continued where
the line had broken. The wire hung just
above the heads of a stream of people
that was turning from Market street into
Powell. The women nearest the accident,
-' the writhing wire and the streaks
me where it touched the car tracks,
turned away screaming and struggled to
nek on Market street. The people
; them, seeing and hearing the tur
iroil and noise, rushed forward and forced
ghtened ones back toward the wire.
Thus creating almost a panic. It was
wire time before the wire lost its appar
â¢ nt force.

CLAIM CARMEN
STRANDED THEM
Passengers Bring Suits
to Enforce Transfer
Privilege.
Say They Were Left in the
Suburbs to Face Mud
and Storm.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 17.
To enforce the right of street car pas
sengers to be carried to the destination
Cor which a transfer coupon might be is
sued ie the purpose of two suits which
wore hied to-day in Justice Quinn's court
by Attorney George Edgar Jackson, who
represents Henry Spencer, the famous
jockey who rode for the Prince of Wales,
and Al W. White, a former Deputy Sher
iff of this county and a weil known man
about town.
The suits are lodged against the Oak
land Transit Company and the complaint
is based upon the alleged refusal of a
CAT new to carry White and Spencer from
Golden Gate to West Berkeley one stormy
night last December. The complainants
declare that they were given the alterna
tive of plowing their way two miles
through mud and rain or of stopping at
a hotel in Golden Gate at their own ex
pense. The carmen, say White and Spen
<.Â¦< r. refused to recognize their right u>
ride the remainder of the way, although
they had transfers from the San Pablo
K\t;iue electric line. The reason assigned
by the conductor was that he had made
his last trip for the night.
"But," expostulated White, "transfers
were issued to us. and here they are. We
want to go to West Berkeley."
"Can't help it," was the reply. "This
car is going to turn in for the night."
"Guess we are stranded," commented
Spencer.
And they were, for the car did turn in.
The formal recital of the complaints is
that White and Spencer boarded a San
Pablo avenue car at Twelfth street ani
Broadway at 11 p. rrr. December 18, 1900.
They reached Golden Gate twenty min
utes later, where transfers to the West
Berkeley extension were issued. After
waiting twenty minutes the car from
West Berkeley rolled into the terminus.
Instead of making another trip out, it
continued downtown, after the two belated
passengers had their unfruitful colloquy
with the carmen.
Spencer and White ask judgment for
$200 damages.

SEL AND A FEW MEMBERS OF THE JURY.
OAKLAND, Dec. 17.â The famous
battle of Elmhurst, fought on the
afternoon of Sunday, December 1,
has ended in smoke. "What will
probably be the last chapter but
one of the history of the war was closed
this afternoon in Justice Larue's court,
when a jury of seven good men and truo
acquitted Edward Hansen Of the charge
of battery. There are fifteen other com
plaints that receive their origin from
this neighborhood meeting, but, as the
result of to-day's trial, Judge Larue will
to-morrow wipe clean his calendar by dis
missing the remaining cases.
Hansen was acquitted but judge, jury
and counsel are yet in the dark as to
what took place. Deputy District At
torney George Samuels !s dazed and re
plies "to all queries with: "Who struck
Billy Patterson?"
Judge Larue says he is glad he docs
not live within the firing line.
The jurors shake their heads and mut
ter in chorus: "Them women!"
The trouble occurred about the time of
day when, in most rural districts, the
cows come home. Cows are different In
Elmhurst. They are brought home.
Everybody was out after his or her cow
and that is how it happened that every
body was on hand for the tangle that
JudgÂ« Larue has vainly tried to

which made the wound necessarily fata).
When they probed for the bullet they
found it at the base of the skull in a po
sition where it could not bo extracted.
Coroner Mebrmann held an inquest to
night, when Joseph J. Racine, the hus
band, was the principal witness. He testi
fied that with his wife he dined at a down
town restaurant Monday evening, and
then wont home to prepare for initiation
In the Knights of Pythias. She objected,
and he agreed to remain at home with
her. Later he went out to k^ep a busi
ness engagement, returning about .10:15
o'clock. The quarrel was renewed as soon
as be pot into the house.
"Suddenly she went into the bedroom."
said Racine, "and in a moment came back
with a pistol In her hand. I said, 'My
God, Maud, what are you going to dor
She- said. Til not bother you any more.'
and pointing thi- pistol at her head fired.
She foil at my feet and ] thought she was
dead. She expressed her sorrow at the

story of the mixup as told from seven

Hit Giandma in the Glasses.
Mrs. Susan Gray was one of the seven
teen. She told the story substantially as
follows:
I saw Mrs. Alvin catch Mrs. Delhi by the
arm and slap her in the face. Mrs. Deihl said,
"Slap me again and I'll tear every spear of
hair out of your head." Then Mr. Alvin took
Mrs. Delhi by the throat and choked her. Mr.
Hansen came up and said to Mr. Alvin: "No
fighting with the ladies'." Mr. Alvin then hit
Mr. Hansen and Mr. Hansen knocked him
down. Did it twice. ' Mr. Alvin then went
home, washed away the blood and mud and
returned. Then Mr. Meyers struck Mrs. Han
sen and Mr. Alvin hit Mrs. Hansen'a grand
mother right in the spectacles.
After this Mrs. Alvin, Mrs. Nicholson and
another lady were standing all bunched up,
calling each other liars. I believe, Judge, that
I'm the blackest liar in Elmhurst.
"Who said that?" asked Deputy District
Attorney Samuels.
Mrs. Gray answered: "Mrs. Meyers did.
She said it after the right, when we was
all telling each other who was liars and
who wasn't."
In the course of her testimony Mrs.
Gray referred to the unpleasantness as "a
regular Muldoon's picnic."
Asked by Attorney Samuels for an ex
planation of the simile she said:
I was once at a theater where they had a
play by that name and in It was a character

GAMBLERS DEFENDANTS
IN PECULIAR LAWSUITS;
Firms Robbed by Employes Demand
Return of Money From Gam
ing Houses.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 17.â A series
of peculiar lawsuits arising out of the
conduct of gambling games has been be
gun in Vancouver. The Hinton Electric
Company, the largest concern of its kinci
in the province, has entered suit against
the proprietors of the Balmoral and Mint
gambling-houses for the return of $2000.
This is money alleged to have been stolen
by clerks in the employ of the Hinton
Company and by them gambled away in
the houses mentioned. The largest part
of this amount was embezzled by the late
local manager, George F. Cutler, who is
now in Portland. Cutler spent much
money and left the city when he could
not make good his shortage.
The gambling-houses claim that Cutler,
instead of being a loser, frequently won
large sums at roulette and blackjack.
They have refused to pay the claim of his
former employers, and the cases will now
be taken into the courts. Sir Hibbert
Tupper has been retained as counsel for
the plaintiff.

A GOOD thing to recollect Is this: We do not
reckon a sale complete unless the customer
gets all he Is entitled to. We give a perfect.
sound and undamaged new piano for lesÂ«
money than is often asked for patched up
and made over Instruments, worked off under
all sorts of disguises. It is much better to
get a reliable new piano that Is known, than
a "bargain" that ia good only for the time
being. Our pianoa or customers are not
"wrecked." Ask about our new plan of
$1 50 per week. We sell Wlssnur, Decker

KILLS WOMEN
IN HER ROOM
Burglar Ends the Life of
a Notable Church
Member.
PITSBURG, Pa:, Dec. 17.â Harriet P.
Murphy, prominent In church and social
circles and treasurer of . the Kingslay
House fund, was -murdered at her home,
6221 Howe street, East End, by a burglar
this morning.- The murderer escaped.
Miss Murpny was the only sister of Se
lect Councilman John A. Murphy from
the Twentieth ."Ward and . was thirty
years old. She, with her brother and two
servants, women, lived alone in the house.
Miss Murphy was sleeping on the second
floor. She was an expert with the revol
ver, having practiced many years for the
purpose of protecting herself in the event
of just such an attack as happened this
morning,? and she always had ! a- pistol
either under her pillow or within easy,
reach.. -"
About 3 o'clock this morning her brother
was awakened by two shots, and hasten
ing to his sister's room found her dying
on the floor. There was a bullet wound
in the head. . '/The burglar had scaled the
porch posts and entered the window' of
Miss> Murphy's room by breaking the
glass. It is . supposed that ' the noise of
the crashing glass awakened her, and" as
she jumped from the bed with her re
volver in her hand the man fired. Marks
in the â  snow-, on the porch roof indicate
that only one man entered the room.
.Miss Murphy usually kept the collec
tions for the Kingsley House fund in. her
room untiK they : reached a sum i large
enough to be placed in the bank, and It
is thought the burglar -was after this
money. ' : â  , .
When the police raised Miss j Murphy
they â¢: found , the revolver within a few
inches of her right hand' under, the folds
of her nlgrht dress. .The falling: â¢â¢ of Miss
Murphy's body is thought to have scared
the thief away -before he had time to
think about stealing anything." A careful
investigation was made of the room â  and
not a thing of any value was missing.

SANTA CLATTS GIVES AWAY
MANY TJSEFXTL PRESENTS*
Sisters of the Holy Family Hold
Their Annual Christmas Tree
Festival.
Santa Claus played a star engagement
at the Alhambra Theater yesterday after
noon. His 'audience, which was com
posed of nearly a thousand children, ap
plauded his every movement and accepted
the gifts from his generous hands with
fervent thanks.
The occasion was the annual Christmas
tree festival for the children of the Day
Homes and Sewing Schools, conducted by
the Sisters of the Holy Family. The the
ater was never filled with a more content
ed and happy gathering, and every child
who attends the schools conducted by the
Sisters was present. They ranged from
3 to 6 years of age, and all were neatly
and comfortably dressed. The brightest
among them took part in the lengthy pro
gramme-presented, and their efforts were
heartily applauded by parents and friends.
The programme opened with the singing
of the "Adeste Fldells" by the children.
This was followed by a pretty addres3 by
Marguerite Gorman. A song of welcome
followed, and then the Daisies made their
bow. Twenty little tots dressed In pink,
with head coverings that resembled the
flower they represented, sang a carol. The
kindergarten boys made a sturdy appear
ance as carpenters. They wore aprons,
and every little fellow handled his ham
mer with the force of an honest work
man. Other songs and recitations were
given by the various classes, and the
audience showed its appreciation by
hearty applause. Mrs. A. B. Collins act
ed as the accompanist. The work of the
children redounds to the credit of the Sis
ters of the Holy Family, who teach their
young charges many useful things.

ANOTHER WILL
NOW OFFERED
Document Executed by
Kershow Filed by
Contestants.
The will made by Max Kershow in Phil
adelphia in July, 1893, was offered in evi
dence yesterday in Department 9 of the
Superior Court, where the trial of the con
test of the will purported to have been
made in this city is being held. The
Philadelphia document, when first exe
cuted, bequeathed to an aunt of Max Ker
ehow $5000 and the rest and residue of the
estate in trust" for Carleton Kershow, a
brother, and Edward and J. Henry Ker
ehow, uncles of the deceased. The Phila
delphia Trust, Safe and Deposit Company
was named as trustee. A codicil made in
February, 189S, revoked the paragraph in
the body of the will and placed the trust
fund in the hands of J. Henry Kershow,
one of the uncles.
Attorney Rix spent the entire day in
probing into the characters of the wit
nesses to the contested will and men
who associated with the Yale man while
he lived In this city. Detectives Bain
bridge and Dillon testified that A. J.
Meadows, one of the subscribing wit
nesses, was not noted for his probity or
integrity, and Judge Fritz, who was asked
concerning the reputation of Jules Gam
age, said:
"He is a friend of -mine, but I do not
think he bears a good reputation."
One of the features of the proceedings
yesterday was the regularity with which
Attorneys Rix and Tauszky called each
other names. Invitations "to come oui
eide" and such expressions as "you are
bluffing" and "you can't bluff me" occur
red with such frequency that the bailiff
of the court removed the padlock placed
by the orders of Judge Coffey on the gate
which affords Ingress to the clerk's desk
and behind which the bailiffs sit. The at
torneys, however, did not come to blows.
The case will be on trial again to-day.

DRUMMERS ENJOY
NIGHT AT TRIVOLI
Fifth. Annual Benefit of
Association Proves a
Great Success.
It was a gala night at the Tivoli last
night, the occasion being the fifth an
nual benefit of the San Francisco Com
mercial Travelers' Association. The
suave gentlemen of the road were out in
force, as the packed house testified.
Every drummer had his lady and alto
gether the audience was one of the moat
Interesting that has gathered In that fa
vorite temple of song in many a day.
Preparatory to the reception of the as
sociation's guests of the evening the dec
orators took charge of the interior, and
their skillful handiwork was evidenced in
a beautiful grouping of -flags, bannerettes,
festoons and association devices on the
balcony rails, boxes and proscenium arch.
The draping of the decorations was artis
tic and the coloring resembled the glow
of a summer's sunset. The insignia of
the association was conspicuously, dis
played, and during the presentation of
"Ked Riding Hood," the evening's bill,
the device was cheered.
It is the custom of the association to
give an entertainment annually, the pur
pose being not only to enrich the coffers
of the organization in aid of its charita
ble and beneficial work but to bring the
membership into closer fraternal relation
ship with one anoti.er. The entertain
ments have uniformly been highly suc
cessful, as is indeed most everything the
commercial men attempt. The affair of
last night lacked in no respect, the fea
tures of the events of former yearsâ good
fellowship, bonhomie and warm enthusi
asm.'
The opera was hugely enjoyed by the
audience, as the hearty applause testified.
The local hits, and particularly the jokes
rung in on leading members of the asso
ciation, were enthusiastically received.
The principals of the cast entered into
the spirit of the occasion, the result be
ing a very enjoyable performance. Praise
is due Florence Chapman, Annie Myers,
Olive Ulrich. Ferris Hartinjin, Edward
Webb and Arthur Cunningham for their
artistic work. The subordinates filled the
bill acceptably.
The officers of the association are: B.

financial secretary; John H. Horstmann,
treasurer; Charles L. Adams and P. T.

THE SA1ST FBANCISCO ; Ci^LL,, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1901.
OREGON UPHOLDS
A PRIMARY LAW
Supreme Court of That
State Sustains
une jl es u cy.
Act in Question the Same in
Principle as California
Statute.
.The decision of the Oregon Supreme
Court sustaining the Lockwood primary
election law enacted by the Legislature
of that State is recognized as a victory
for the cause of clean polities and good
government. The Oregon law, which is de
clared-constitutional, is the same in prin
ciple as the California law adopted at the
last session of the Legislature. One of
the essential points at issue before the
Oregon court was. the test, or . the pro
vision of the law requiring a voter to de
clare his political sentiment. Following is
the provision of the Oregon law on, this
point:
Any person desiring to vote shall state to the
first of the election clerks (which clerk shall
not be of the same political party as the chair
man) his name and his residence and shall de
mand an official ballot of the political party
or association he desires to use in voting, and
the said clerk shall' thereupon announce the
name and ' residence and party or association
distinctly and write in the poll book of ; the
political party or association the name and
residence of the elector with pen and ink.
The test prescribed for participating in a
party primary is that the elector "voted
for a majority of the candidates of such
party at the last election or intends to
do so at the next election." â¢
Regarding the Test.
The court in sustaining the test says:
Is the test a reasonable regulation by which
to ascertain party affiliations? Mr. Bryce says
the usual test adopted by parties Is, "Did the
claimant vote the party ticket at the last im
portant election or that for the State Governor
ship?" The Wisconsin acts of 1805 and 1807
prescribe in effect that precise test. The Cali
fornia act of 1897 provides that If a person
challenged make oath that it was his bona fide
present intention to support' the nominees of the
convention to which delegates are to be elect
ed for such political party or organization, he
should be entitled to vote. The act was de
clared unconstitutional, but not upon that
ground. And the Legislature evidently so un
derstood it, as at its session in 1901 it passed
another act containing precisely the same test
to be applied at a party primary- election. By
the New Tork act the elector must declare
that he is in general sympathy with the princi
ples of the party at whose primary he desires
to vote, that it is his intention to support gen
erally at the next general election, State or
National, the nominees of such party for State
or National offices, and that he has not en
rolled with or participated in any primary elec
tion or convention of any other party since the
first day of the preceding year. This is as far
as we have been able toÂ»flnd precedent, and we
are impressed that the New York provisions are
better calculated to serve the purpose for
which they are Intended than the others, and
yet it Is concededly impossible to provide any
test "by which all fraud and illegal voting may
be detected and prevented. Much must be left
to the Legislature to determine, and so long, as
It cannot be said that the test adopted, is inapt
and unreasonable it ought to be permitted to
stand: hence we are constrained to hold that
the present law is' valid, as 4t respects that
specific objection.
Should Stand in California.
If the test stands in Oregon, where the
constitution of the State does not In dis
tinct terms authorize the Legislature to
pass a lav/ applying it to primary elec
tions, it should certainly stand in Califor
nia, as the constitution of this State ex
pressly grants the Legislature power to
prescribe a test. Constitutional amend
ment No. 4, adopted by the California
Legislature March, 1859, and ratified by
the people in 1900, gives the Legislature
power to apply party tests to primary
elections. v
The pregon law, held to be valid by the
Supreme Court of that State, goes further
than a mere party test. In providing for
primary-elective ballots it requires:
The official ballots of each party or associa
tion participating in the election shall be dif
ferent In tint or color from those of the other
parties or associations, so as to be readily" dis
tinguishable therefrom. Duplicate Impressions
of the same shall be printed upon cheaper col
ored paper so as to' be readily distinguishable
from the official ballots. These, sample bal
lots shall be uniform In color for all political
parties and associations and shall be used sole
ly as sample ballots for the information and
convenience of voters, and shall not be voted,
and if voted shall not be counted.
In Oregon a blanket ballot Is used and
the names of the candidates for the nom
inating convention are printed thereon.
In this State the ballot Is blank and the
names are written thereon, or attached
thereto by pasters.
Able lawyers who have carefully studied
the Oregon decision and compared the
primary law of that State with the law
of California are firmly convinced that
our present primary election act is con
stitutional. â -, â  â¢â¢

Court - Martial at Presidio
Fails to Dispense
Justice.
-A general court-martial now in session
at the Presidio and supposedly / meting
out justice to wrongdoers in the ranks
received yesterday at the hands of Colonel
Rawles the most severe reprimand, -it is
said, that ever emanated from the head
quarters of the Department of Calif ornia.
The membership of the court includes sev
eral officers of high rank and distinguish
ed bervice. . Consequently there was some
little* stir in military circles yesterday
when the order was made public _
On the fourth floor of the Phelan build-
Ing, and at the Presidio, the officers were
discussing the matter* unofficially and
many were thanking their lucky stars
that they had not been detailed for the
court-martial which has so suddenly be
come prominent. It is said that the mem
bers of the court cannot but feel injured
at the tone of the order, but In the army
the only recourse that inferiors have in
such cases is to keep as quiet as possible
and confine the expression of their opin
ions to their immediate friends.
Private Evans Causes Trouble.
Private Samuel H. Evans, Troop G,
Sixth Cavalry, was tried and found guilty
of a charge of desertion. He was sen
tenced to imprisonment at hard labor on
Alcatraz Island for one and one-half
years. The court decided that errors had
been made in the proceedings, and the
man was tried again.' After ISvans had
been disposed of the second time,- it was
found necessary to give him a third trial.
It is quite certain that the soldier did
something wrong, but nobody seems to
know just what it was, and in spitÂ© of
the plethora of trials he must' now be al
lowed to go free.
Colonel Rawles' criticism which has
caused all the disturbance is as follows:
In the foregoing case the record is full of
mistakes, and the proceedings are a discredit
to the service. The accused was charged with
desertion, and when brought to trial pleaded
not guilty of desertion, but absence without
leave; the judge advocate then rested, and the
court without any evidence whatever proceeded
to find the accused guilty as charged.
The record being returned to the court for
reconsideration of its findings, and the illegal
ity of its action pointed out, the court properly
reconsidered its action and found the accused
guilty of absence without leave. At this re
vision one member of the court was absent at
a wedding and did. not attend the session,
while another who had been sick at the trial
of the case took his seat at the revision, com
pletely vitiating the action taken. At the
second revision one member was absent be
cause he had not been notified of the meeting
of the court, and the court adhered to- Us
first findings and sentence. '
Tho necessity for members to attend to the
duties of general courts-martial has been so
often mentioned in orders that it seems in
credible that officers would be so negligent of
them No officer can excuse himself from at
tending the sessions of a court-martial, and
the department commander will In the future
hold officers to a strict accountability for
their absences.
The action of the court in finding the ac
cused ' guilty as charged, without the intro
duction of any evidence looking to his rrullt,
cannot be sustained by any process of reason
ing known to the reviewing authority.
Proceedings Are Disapproved.
It is the duty of the Government before it
can inflict any punishment on a plea of not
guilty to overcome the . presumption of inno
cence which surrounds even the greatest crim
inal by evidence of guilt, and until this is
done, the findings must be not guilty. It was
the further duty of the court to modify â¢ Us
findings In accordance with the law and facts
as explained to them, instead of foolishly ad
hering - to its mistake. Had the court taken
the plea of the accused, and found him guilty
of absence without leave, he could have been
legally punished by being dishonorably dis
charged and confined at - hard labor for six
months; but he now escapes all merited pun
ishment which the court evidently considered
preferable than to admit that it had committed
an error.
The proceedings, finding and sentence, are
disapproved, and the accused will be released
from confinement and restored to duty.
While all the members of the court are
censured and all are to some degree re
sponsible for the proceedings according- to
military regulations, the fault In similar
cases is usually laid at the doors of the
president of the court and the judge ad
vocate.
The court is composed of the following
named officers.
Lieutenant Colonel â¢ George "S. Grimes, ar
tillery corps, president; First Lieutenant Stan
ley D. Embrlck, artillery corpa, Judge advo
cate; Major Charles \V. Hobbs, artillery corps;

Charles Roy zen Sentenced to
Six Months in the
County Jail.
Charles Royzen, who has been masquer
ading as a cavalryman, appeared before
Judge Fritz yesterday on the charge of
petty larceny. He pleaded guilty and said
he would waive time for sentence. The
Judge promptly sentenced* him to serve
six months in the County Jail, a .
Royzen is a bootblack from Chicago.
He came here recently by "beating" his
way on freight trains. He made acquain
tances in the dance halls and saloons on
Pacific street and hit upon the scheme
of masquerading in a cavalry uniform and
enticing soldiers to : the resorts on the
Barbary Coast,, where if they did not lose
all their money and valuables he would
take them to' a lodging house and do the
job himself. - . â¢
Complaints were soon made by duped
soldiers at police headquarters and De
tective T. B. Gibson was detailed on the
case. Robert O. Parker, who had two
watches stolen from him by Royzen in a
lodging house on Kearny street, was one
of . the complainants and when Royzen
heard of it he had the audacity to make
a charge at the Presidio that Parker was
in the habit of stealing shirts from the
stores and Parker was thrown into the
guard house till an investigation could be
made.
Gibson, accompanied by a policeman,
went to a dance hall on Pacific street
Saturday night and lound Royzen in the
midst of a , group of soldiers. He was
taken to the City Prison and booked on
the charge of petty larceny for stealing
Parker's watches which were worth less
than $50.
John Hoffman, another soldier, claims
that Royzen robbed him of a diamond
ring and other articles in a Kearny street
lodging house and there are many others
who make complaints. Royzen may yet
be prosecuted on the charge made by Hoff
man if the police can find the diamond
ring.

Coroner Leland began an inquest yes
terday upon the body of -Adolph Oppen
heim, the shooting gallery proprietor who
was found lying dead on the floor of his
gallery on Dupont street last Thursday
night. Nothing was developed in the evi
dence that has not already been pub

helm was not on good terms with her
neighbors. The inquest will be resumed
this morning. .

SHORT WATCHES
FOR POLICEMEN
Commissioners Consider
New Scheme in Ex
ecutive Session.
- The Police Commissioners met In execu
tive session with Mayor Phelan last night
after the transaction of the usual business
of the board..
The important proposition of devising a
new system of policing the town was dis
cussed. After' a lengthy conference Chief
Wittmann was directed to plan a scheme
by which the patrolmen will have an
eight-hour watch and sixteen hours off
Instead of the alternate six-hour watches
now in vogue. This will necessitate two
day and two night platoons and a large
increase in the force. Chief Wittman will
report at the next meeting.
James F. Erazel is no longer a member
of the police force of this city. He sent
in his resignation and it was promptly
accepted. The resignation was presented
by Brazel because he feared that he would
be brought up before the Commissioners
and disciplined for conduct unbecoming a
member of the department.
On Sunday last Brazel reported for duty
after an absence of nearly a month. He
had been injured in the late strike and
was on sick leave. When notified to re
port for duty he was in good bodily
health, but through an accident, unavoid
able or otherwise, Brazel's face bore evi
dence of having been in a collision when
he reported for duty at the station. Cap
tain Spillane saw that Brazel was not
presentable and Inquired the cause of the
swellings. Brazel informed him that he
had fallen on the sidewalk. The captain
was of the opinion that Brazel had been
struck by three sidewalks. It developed
subsequently that Brazel had been en
gaged in a disgraceful brawl, and he was
told that he would have to appear before
the Police Commissioners. Rather than
face the ordeal Brazel resigned his posi
tion. Frederick C. Knobman, a printer by
trade, v.-as sworn In to succeed him.
The Commissioners transacted consider
able routine business. Permits for carry
ing deadly weapons were granted to a
number of citizens, and the granting of
liquor licenses occupied the attention of
the board nearly all the evening. Many
applications for the renewal of saloon li
censes were denied, and fully 300 were
granted.
Policeman Charles F. Cassldy was be
fore the board for being fifty ' minutes
late in reporting for duty. His explana
tion was satisfactory, and on the recom
mendations of Chief of Police" Wittman
and Captain Spillane he was excused.
Chief of Police "Wittman was instructed
to watch the Cafe Royal and the Baldwin
Annex and stop percentage poker games
If they were being conducted there.
Policeman John F. O'Shea was repri
manded for leaning on a cigar counter
while on duty. He claimed to be inquir
ing about ?lot machines.'
The Lamp .Hit Him.
Alice Fitzpatrick and her husband, "Wil
liam, fell into a conversational war last
night at their room at the Llndell House,
Sixth and Howard streets, and wound ur>
their affair in the police station. Alice
demonstrated her lack of spousal affec
tion by throwing a lamp at "William
"William went to the hospital and had
stitches put in his scalp. Alice was taken
to jail. and charged with assault with a
deadly weapon. -
