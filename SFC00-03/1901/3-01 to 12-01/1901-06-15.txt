that a concert Is to be given and that
the parties giving the concert shall sell
tickets and bear allexpenses. 7 The society
is guaranteed a certain . cash sum, never
more than $200, and' "75 per cent of all
money, taken In at the door on the night
of the 'concert." After '. the city has been
thoroughly worked in the sale of tickets,
the average amount of cash taken in "at

asked Lewis if he would not trade oil

Ames also saw the advertisement offer

asked him to look into it.- He answered
the advertisement and Gordon called upon
him. Ames was told exactly the same
story as Lewis, except that Crosby was
willing to sell for $3000. Ames wired to>
St. Louis and was offered from 12 to 15

Early Thursday* afternoon a | stranger
came' into Ames" office and opened nego

would not give his name. He offered
$6000 cash", for the 60 000 shares, but Ames
told him of the higher offer he bad got
from St. Louis. The stranger told him
he would wire to Denver and asked Ames
not to close till to-day, when he would
get a" reply. He was a. confederate of the
swindlers. After he went away Amej
again wired* Carleton. Rose & Co.. St.
Louis, that stock would be deposited only
on the payment of cash. The answer came
yesterday morning that they, could not

How the' Schemers Work.
A GANG of professional .."charity
workers." headed by a man
known as William Donnely,* Is
now engaged in imposing upon
the' citizens of this fdty". the
headquarters of the aggregation being in
room 612, Enima Spreckels building. '
The expose of the methods of Mrs. K. C.
Gregory, alias Graham, by The Call a few
days ago has been followed up by. fur
ther investigations, with the result that
this paper has discovered that a number
of persons are banded together for the
purpose of "milking the public," the term
used by the schemers In referring to their
Imprsition on charitably Inclined citizens.
i Associated with William Donnely, who
i < laims to hail from New 'York, are ' C.
Ernest Edwards, M. B. Weinberg, Miss
Helen Barnes. Miss Bertie Edwards. Miss
Mae TI!d*>n and Miss Deitweilcr, while a.
number of respeeta'ble young women of
Â£an Francisco have been duped Into ac
cepting employment with the unsavory
outfit.
The methods of Donnely and his -gang
are practically the same as those exposed
by The Call in the case of Mrs. Gregory.
Charitable an/1 benevolent societies are
epproached with the offer of a "benefit"
concert, which results In the societies get
ting one dollar to nine dollars pocketed
by the schemers.
r"n1es=s the police interfere with Donnely
end his associates, or the public stops do
nating to the "benefit" concerts he is en
gineering-, the combination is likely to
clear up many thousands of dollars in
this city. For the past month Donnely
and his operatives have been engaged in
selling tickets for. benefit concerts to be

Home, run by a man named Hutchinson
In the Mission, and also for the Children's
Finding Society of Oakland. Hutchinson's
"home" has been exposed as not being all
thai is claimed for it, and he is at present
hand and glove with Donnely.
Select the. First Victim.
Lewis was the first one selected by' the
gang. Gordon called at his office, on FrN
day, May 17, and introduced himself as a
second cousin from Denver. â¢ He 1 was fa
miliar with all Lewis', relatives. and 4 told
him that his * real r.ame was Rodgers but
he had assumed the name of Gordon, as
he had trouble with his wifeand did not
want", ner to know â¢ where 'Â¦Â¦ he > was. .' He
showed .: Lewis a letter purporting to be
fromW. : T. Rodgers, employed In 'the of
fice of - the . R. C." Bogy Investment â¢ Com
pany,, Denver. Gordon first enjoined Lewis
to the' utmost secrecy.. : In; the. letter it
was stated that Bogy^, was anxious to get
control of : the' stock of j the -Ward Consoli
dated'Gold Mining Company, of Colorado,
as : an"' English I syndicate ;. was ; negotiating
to ''buy'.' the mine, which had developed ex-^
tensive ores. " Rodgers had 'discovered that

Three different stockbrokers in the city,
at least, have been approached by the
swindlers, but Captain j Seymour expects
that others will.be reported. The three
are Paul Redfield Lewis, stockbroker, 210
Examiner building;. "W. A. Desborough of
the National Investment Company, 825
Market street, and W. B. Ames, manager
Investors'" Development Company, 5 640
Market stree't. Their experience was prac
tically the same.
There is another member of the gang
still at : liberty. Captain Seymour was
called up by telephone after the three
men were arrested and a man's voice told
him that Gordon lived at 721; Clayton
street, which proved to be false. The
supposition is that" the confederate tele
phoned to throw" the detectives off the
scent. â¢
Gordon, or Rodgers, as he is also known,
was identified last night as Frank Fegen
bush, one of the most noted confidence
men in the country. Some time ago he.
and another crook, named Harry Dubois,
swindled a wealthy man of. Chicago out
of $8000 by the' same means the gang
worked in this city. Fegenbush was re
leased on bonds and fled to Denver, where
he swindled a woman named " Laura

similar offenses. , -_.-..,; ,

! When the accident appeared inevitable
the. Communl paw ferry boat's speed was
reduced as much as possible .under the
circumstances, but. borne along by the
swift running flood tide, the head of the
Mauch "Chunk; struck the Northfield on
the starboard side at the head of the for

blow. Was a terrific one and the force of it
wrecked the steering gear of the forward
end of the"; Mauch .Chunk, tore^up.about
ten feet of the main deck, < wrecked' the
deckhouse on' the port side and broke
through the deck rail and threw down the

The Northfield, with a load of passen
gers variously estimated at S0O to 1200. at
6:01 p. m. started out of the west slip at
Whitehall street for St. George, Staten
Island, and at'5:53 p. m. the Mauch
Chunk left the railroad slip at Communl
paw for Whitehall street. " The â¢ latter
craft was abreast of the Barge Office at
the Battery when the Northfleld came
out of the slip. 'An exchange of whistles
between the boats "was' followed by the
crash./ Captain Griffin apparently be
lieved that the Staten Island ferry boat
would be halted until he had worke'd his
boat into the upper slip, and on the other
hand Captain Johnson supposed that he
would be' allowed to cross the Mauch
Chunk's bows. . ,
The swift running flood "tide and the
question of which boat had the right of
way was the cause of the disaster. Cap
tain Abraham Johnson was in charge of
the Northfield and Captain C. S. Griffin
was in command of the ( Mauch Chunk.
Each lays the blame for the collision
upon the other.
Captains Blame One Another.
While the Northfield was well supplied
with life-preservers, .which were stowed
in out-of-the-way places, not more than
two dozen of the endangered passengers
were able to get the lifebelts on. This
state of affairs was" because the life-pre
servers were not handily obtainable, and
the wildest sort _ of. panic followed when
the hundreds of passengers realized their
danger. This was only a few minutes
before the Northfield. sank to the bottom
of the river; and then all who had not
jumped to the tugs found themselves in
the water..
The reason for such difference ; of- oplnÂ£
ion as Â¦ to" the extent'- of k A theV<iU.saster" is
that "the "wildest jexcftemerit'preyafled~"on
the Northfield. ,-The tug.' Mutual- saved In
all about, seventy-five' persons from the
Northfield, and the tugs "Unity and Arrow
saved between them 150 persons. /"Two
policemen of the Old Slip: station claim
to have rescued nearly thirty. As soon
as ' the crowd which had' followed the
sinking ferry-boat along the river -front
was able to render any aid it worked with
a" will, and in many instances' men sprang
into the water to save life. The greatest
service was rendered by the . tugboats,
Â¦which circled around the Northfield and
made a bridge to ; the : Spanish 'line pier.
Men and women clambered over the tugs
to the shore. . ,

NEW, YORK,- June j 14.â The * wooden

in the service of the Stateri Island Ferry
Company for the past thirty-eight years,
was rammed to.-night by the steel-hulled
propeller Mauch Chunk, used as, a ferry
boat by the Central* Railroad of. New Jer

Staten .Island ferry slip, at the ' foot of
Whitehall street; and in less than twenty
minutes afterward -the' Northfleld. which
was crowded with passengers; sank at
the outer end of the Spanish line pier, in
the East River. The Mauch Chunk,
which .was badly damaged, landed two
dozen pnssengers who were aboard of her.
More than a nundred of ' the passengers
of the; sunken: Northfleld were dragged
out of . the water by people along shore and
the crews of the fleet of rivervtugs. which
promptly responded to the /ferry-boat's

passengers were hurt in the accident, and

of the passengers leaped into the water

Donnely has admitted in -the past few
days that he was scored by the press
in Los Angeles. He Informed Mrs. Pet
tee that he had a copy of. the paper that
had denounced him, but refused to allow
her to see it. The following dispatch
throws some .light on the subject:
LOS ANGELES, June 14.â A man giving
his name as Wellington, W. Danohy, ac
companied by a woman who gave â¢ her
name as Helen Barnes, defrauded char
itable institutions In Los Angeles of about
J1000 during the month of â¢ March. The
pair came to Los Angeles from the East
early in March and spent about a month
here. They stopped at one of the best ho
tels in the city, and spent money freely.
' The woman claimed to be a sister-in-law
of Danohy. Their plan was to create: the
Impression that they were philanthropists
des' 4 -ous of aiding worthy charitable con
cerus. , Dr. Seymour, president of the .local
Humane Society, was induced to sign a
contract for a ' musical- performance,
which was to be given under the direction
of Danohy and * Miss Barnes. They were
given the right to solicit subscriptions for
the benefit of the society -for a certain
percentage and were also" accorded the
privilege of selling.- tickets. .The enter
tainment was given, but Danohy and'his
partner had been exposed and /left for
other pastures. >;
The man and. woman -. pocketed 'the
moneys they obtained through' the 'sale of
tickets and left for San Diepo. where they
worked the same game. They had made
arrangements to work the same scheme
with two other charitable organizations
here and left town nearly 51000 better* off
than they were when they landed here.'.
- '. * 1 Â¦Â» . ' ' f ' '
Some of the young women who have
been hired by Donnely in the past two
weeks have been asked by him to travel
with him to . other cities. One or two
have consented to do so, while others are
in doubt. . â¢ , â¢ -
Mrs. Gregory, who learned^' the* charity
bunko game Â¦ from Donnely, recently
approached the Society for the Pre
vention ; of Cruelty to Children and
the . Society for-' the Prevention of
Cruelty, to Animals. In .each case
her offer to give a benefit, concert was
refused. â¢ To Secretary 'Holbrook of the
Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals, a letter was sent from the Grand
Hotel, signed "Miss C. C. Graham.". The
writer was requested by Mr. Holbrook to
call upon him, whereupon. Mrs. Gregory
called and claimed that her sister, "Miss
Graham," had written the letter. â¢ Mrs.
Gregory and "Miss Graham" are one and
the same person and her deception was
easily discovered by The Call. ;
Donnely and his band still hold forth
in the Emma Spreckels building. In
room 612. If the concerts for which Don
nely and his associates have sold tickets
do not take place, and the purchasers of
tickets do not receive their money back,
the Donnely schemers will be guilty, of
rank fraud.
One of the persons who answered Don
nely's advertisement for help .was a Airs.
Carr, wife of a* clerk in a liquor house.
Mrs. Carr was set to work selling tickets,
but when she found out that all was not
as represented she turned back a number
of donations and the purchase Drice of
tickets to those from whom she had re
ceived them. When -she told Donnely of
this he was furious and declared Mrs.
Carr had "kept the money. He invoked the
aid of the police, but the officers found
that Mrs. Carr was a respectable, .honest
woman. . -
Experience of a Dupe.
each for a prominent society, providing
his "lady associates" are In good trim.
Those who know the inside working of
the Donnely scheme say that it is a poor
day's work that does not result in three
to five hundred dollars being received
from the sale of tickets. The spoils are
divided each evening. The women start
out in the morning to sell tickets and set
tle with Donnely In the evening. The
women are paid their salaries or percent
ages and Donnely "banks" the balance of
cash in his capacious pockets. He does
not trust the banks of San Francisco, and
buys money orders, which are sent to^his
bank account in the East.

For several miles they made good prog

were two days out that, the peril began.
Without warning the ice jam broke be

ice soon overtook them. -Cakes floated on
all sides of their frail raft and they were
in constant danger of destruction, tv-ov
worked incessantly in an effort to extri

but all their labors were unavailing, and
there was nothing for it but to allow the
raft to be swept along. That they es
caped death they regard as miraculous.
Again and again during their trying voy
age they had narrow escapes from having
their raft turned over or being crushed
between the larger floes. . '.
The men left Indian River for Dawson
on May 13. and arrived .at the Yukon cap
ital oii May 25. They had gone from Daw
son to Indian River over the ice on a
duck-shooting expedition, and meeting no
success had decided to return to Dawson.
The ice had broken, and notwithstanding
that the river was full of ice theydecldbd

General Strike Ordered

Nearly Five : Thousand Men

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 14.â A gen-^
eral strike .has been ordered of all the"
trackmen (which ' Includes the bridge
builders) organizations of the Canadian
Pacific Railway. The cause of the strike
is the. refusal of the company, to recog
nize the' organizations of the trackmen
and treat with them as they do with the
other brotherhoods of the railway serv
ice. . .'. Â¦
The order mailed to. all points in East
ern Canada by William Wilson, president
of- the trackmen,' calls upon them to de
liver their keys to the nearest -station
agent before June 17, and quit all work for
the company. 1 Over 3000 men will gt> out
In Eastern Canada," while in the North
west there w\ll .be another thousand join
them In sympathy with the action in the
East, and British Columbia will probably
swell the number by -five hundred. more.
. On Wednesday the final decision of the
grievance committee, as it is called, was
presented to President Shaughnessy and
Vice President D. McNicoll.of the Cana
dian Pacific The chief contention of the
men is that their unions should be recog
nized, and over Eastern Canada they ask
an increase of ' wages, the same as has
been granted in British Columbia. The
conference continued on Thursday morn-
Ing, but in the afternoon a letter . -w *Â»Ich
was sent by the committee to the presi
dent caused a suspension of the meeting.
President Â¦ Shaughnessy replied .that the
company had no answer to make. Later
in the evening the order was issued for
the strike and to-day is being circulated.
A dispatch from Montreal this evening
says that another conference is being
held, but what is being done is not re
lated. How far the strike will extend is
a question about which grave concern is
felt. The â¢ trackmen j are well organized
and have a good deal of funds, and their
members say that the other organizations
of the road will certainly see them
through. The trackmen Include section
gangs and, especially In the West, the
bridge construction crews are large.

Transport Ingalls Goes
Down in New- York
Harbor.
Slips From the Drydock and
Oapsizss With Many-
NEW YORK, June 14.â While the United,
States transport Ingalls was In the bal
ance drydock at the Erie Basin, South
Brooklyn, this afternoon, where she was
abcut to undergo extensive repairs, sho
suddenly slipped from the blocks and cap
steed. One man is known to have been
ldlled and many injured.
There were 'about 210 carpenters, ma
chinists and other laborers at work on thd
vessel and dock at the time. It is sup
posed that the vessel was thrown from
an even keel by ballast improperly placed
or by the shifting of the blocks on which, â¢
she rested, causing her to list to star- J
board and driving the sheering beams
â¢through the rotten walls^of.the old Coat
ing drydock in which she was cradled.
Besides the mechanics and other workmen
who crowded the vessel and dock, prepar
ing her for a voyage to Manila, about
thirty Italian laborers are supposed to
have Â¦ been In the hold of the- ship, em
ployed in shifting pigiron ballast. WhUa
ths workmen were trying to escape tha
dock itself, overbalanced by the weight
of. the ship, turned on, Its side and sank
in fifty feet of water. A number of the
'men were borne down Into the- water and.
Jammed under and beneath, the wreckage
which rose to the surface. How many
were caught j could not be learned to
night. . â¢ Â¦ . ' Â¦ â¢ w .-â¢Â¦-.
Martin Anderson, a painter, was caught
under the descending side of. the ship and
killed outright. Others were dragged out
oÂ£ the water badly injured or halt
drowned and hurried to the hospitals.
Added to the horrors of to-night was the
uncertainty of the fate of the men in the
vessel's hold. Some managed, to get to
the deck and leaped into the water as. the
vessel was sinking, but it 13 feared that
the majority were drowned. \
The vessel went into the dock at 11:30
this- morning and about $50,000 was to
have been expended on her repairs. The
dock in which she was placed was a- very
old . one, having been constructed ' over
fifty years ago. An attempt was . made
to close the gate at the time of the acci
dent, but was -unsuccessful. No one could
l>e found to-night who could . give any
estimate of the. amount of damage the
disaster had entailed. ....
A vivid description of the accident was
given Â¦ by Second Officer 1 Grady of the
Quebec line steamship Media, lying- in the
drydock to the west of the Ingalls. He .,
'saw. the collapse- from the deck of his"
own vessel. . . .','-' ... Â¦. -
"I was on the starboard side of our ship,"
he said, "when- I''heard a chorus" of shouts
from the drydock in which - the Ingaila
was lying, and I ran across*. -The trans
port had a heavy list to starboard- and
was rapidly increasing- It. The big string
ers which extended from" the side Of the
dock to the side of the vessel were buck
ling, and suddenly one of them broke and
shot up . into the air. Â¦ - - . . â¢ ,i :
"Then one after -another the props alons
. her side. snapped, and she rose a,t the bow
and settled astern a trifle as she cantÂ©
| down on her side. The props which did
j not break were .driven: through the sides
Â¦ of the dock. . r , . . .
' . "Men were climbing' all over Â¦ the . ship
and the air was full of groans, ' cries and
screams. As the ship turned the gates
of the drydock flew open and the water
came In with a rush. I could see the men
climbing up the sloping deck or the-trans
port and trying to make the port rails.
Many of them jumped from the deck and
Into the water. The men who were work
ing on the staging on the port side were
raised up bv the; vessel as she .went over.
Just before the end I saw some men rush
Up tho companion way to" the*deck v \
Â¦"-- "The- water rushed' Into ~ the dock 'avid
seemed to right the ship' for a second,
and - then - the i dock- went over thia - and
sank with a roar . of] water. As lt ; went
down with. the vessel inside- many men
jumped into the water. The slip was soon
full of them. The blocks and beams rose
to the surface and many of the- men. Wera
wounded by being jammed between float-
Ing timbers."

Dr. Gfeorge W. Fowler against -Dr. George
W. Seifert, which involves the transfer of
150 'shares of ' the defunct Union Saving's
Bank, was decided by Judge Rhodes to
day in favor of Slefert. 1 An important side
issue is the fact that the owner of the
stock will be compelled to pay some $9000
in assessments into the bank for the bene
fit of the depositors. ...--v. ;..-.
. Seifert had been made" the defendant In
a damage suit by J. P. Burke for alleged
malpractice, and after this was settled he
decided to go to Europe for a visit. Fow
ler claims that before the European visit,
while the bank was apparently in a pros
perous condition, : Self ert turned the stock
over to him, so he could attend to it while
his friend was away. \
When Seifert returned from Europe the
bank had failed, and he refused to take
the stock. Fowler then charged Seifert
with knowing the shaky condition of the
bank and , transferring the stock to him
for: the purpose of . avoiding the assess
ments that Â¦ were sure to follow. Judge
Rhodes: held that- the transfer was" a pre
sumptively bqna-flde transaction. : .

SI* JAU1EJ MM., Cincinnati; QM~SAXTA CRUZ, June 14.â By the
light of lanterns and torches the
wreckage on the narrow gauge
road near the tunnel this side of
Felton was cleared away last
ifght. The work began as soon as the
-pecial train with the injured engineer
â¢nd fireman started for Oakland, but it
co'jired many hours' of arduous labor to
replace the twisted rails and splintered
iiet.
The railroad officials have not yet been
able to assign a reason for the accident
v.-hicli imperiled nearly one hundred pas
..enpers on the precipice above the san
Lorenzo. It Is generally considered* that
the train was running at dangerous speed
n crder to make up the time which had
heen lost In making the start from this
city. The roadmaster and trackwalker
who are stationed near the place where
'.he accident occurred assert positively
Lhat no obstruction had fallen on the
irack. It was supposed at first that frag
mtrts of a boulder dropped from the hill
side that rises precipitously on the left
side of the track, but the testimony of
?he trackwnlker eliminates the theory
lhat for a time was based on this belief-
Dr. Knierht of this city, who accom
panied Engineer Stanley and Fireman
Ccyle to the railroad hospital in San
Francisco, returned to-day. He believes
lhat Stanley has a chance for recovery,
but has little hope for Coyle.
All trains were running as usual to-day.
A special was rp.nt from San Jose to Fel

Several factory buildings adjoin . the

which was traveling at high speed. The
pilot of the engine was broken by the
force of the collision and the' bodies of

ALTURAS. June 14.â Alturas wat
thrown Into another whirl of excitement
this evening over the Indian scare at
3>ookoutf Claud Marcus arrived here from
Lookout this evening and gave the report
that 250 Indians and their squaws were
camped about tv.-elve miles west of Look
cut. in the mountains between Lookout
and Little Hot Springs Valley.
The Indians have been gathering stead
ily in that neighborhood since the lynch
lr.g. but no large number has been seen
until this band was discovered yesterday
evening. Telegrams were sent to Lookout
sinking about the matter, but nothing
could be learned. There are only women
at that place now and they are greatly
alarmed. Marcus says no one had in
formed the woman telegraph operator or
any other women of the Indian gathering,
as they were already very much excited.
The report that a large number of men
had gope to Lookout is not true. There
are not over ten men in- the Lookout
country at present. The Modoc men feel
uneasy over the news. Most of them are
only too anxious to shoulder their rifles
and start on the trail of the red men.
Sheriff Street and District Attorney Bon
ner have been trying to set seme man at
the Lookout telephone, but so far their
efforts have been fruitless. In all proba
bility a posse will start for that country
to-morrow morning and State aid may be
e.*ked.
Euch excitement over Indians has not
been experienced in Modoc Countv for
many years, but the recoilectiors of by
erone massacres and Indian depredations
cause the stronsrest to -weaken even on the
frontier lines of Modoc. It is about sixty
miles to Lockout from Alturap, and while
the country Is somewhat settled between
here and there, the Indians could do great
damage before assistance could reach
lookout. The Indians are now camped
In a mountainous country, where they can
fortify themselves against the whites, and
It would be Impossible to rout them out
of their stronghold for months.
To-day's session of the Grand Jury de
veloped" nothing of Interest In the lynch
ing case. Three witnesses were examined
and excused. Every effort is being made
to find some clew to the affair, but it now
Feenis as though nothing can be learned.
However, the examination may last ten
days yet. .

; Abbott is a printer employed on the' Mc-

that he served several terms in the city
j school board. He was always elected by
the unanimous vote of his ward. Regard
ing his resignation he says:
"My resignation is purely a 'matter of
conscience. It Is my determination to
live a life void of offense to God and
man. To do so it becomes necessary to
obey the divine Injunction. 'Come ye out
from among them and be ye separate.' I
have found that In order to be of use to
my â¢ constituents, to obtain needed im
provements for my district, I must stifle
my conscience, enter into cliques and
schemes and become a low politician. As
I cannot do that I have resigned.
"Politics is the most corrupt thing. I
have ever been mixed up with. I am out
of It forever. I have separated mysei;
and my conscience is satisfied. Others
may not agree with me, but I know that
no Christian can sit in the McKeesport

PHILADELPHIA. June 14.â Dark lan
tern methods have prevailed and by offl
cial connivance franchises on Â¦which a.
minimum value of $10,000,000 has been
placed by investors have been stolen from
the city of Philadelphia.
Mayor Ashbrldge has signed the ordi
nance giving to an organization of monev
hungry speculators street car franchises
for practically all the unoccupied streets
in the city. Never before has a steal been
carried to success with the effrontery
that has been exhibited here.
To combat their young rivals in the lo
cal traction field, Messrs. P. A. B. "Widen
er and "William. L. Elkins, who control
the Union Traction Company, are hurry
ing' home from Europe and it is known
that they are spoiling for a fight. There
is a rumor, fairly well authenticated, that
they will make common cause with Albert
L. Johnson in a great battle to come in
the courts.
When It became known that Mayer
Ashbridge had defied what little public
sentiment exists here. and. declining to
serve the Interests of the city, had signed
away streets for absolutely nothing, the
promoters of thirteen companies received
an offer of $3,000,000 for their rights. That
was just twice as much as was offered
the city yesterday for franchises, the on>r
having been scorned by the Mayor. But
$5,000,000 was not enough. When it was re
fused another $5,000,000 was added to the
offer and the f ranchise grabbers gnerely
hugged their new possessions the tighter, j
As a matter of fact, value can hardly'
be. put upon the steal which has been so
expedltlously perfected. Albert Johnson
offered for the same streets that hava
now been given away what is conserva
tively estimated as an equivalent of $4,000.

It froze.
Gold had commenced flowing into Daw-
Fon when the miners left, the miners
bringing their dust taken out in the clean
up then progressing to Dawson to ex
change It for paper at the banks. It was
estimated that from $20,000 to $30,000 was
being received daily at the Yukon capital.
Men were none too plentiful on the creeks
when the clean-up began, and $5 per day
and board and In some cases $6 per day
was being paid. When the scows laden
with perishable goods reached Dawson
prior to the departure of the present ar
rivals there was a great slump in prices.
Eggs went down, step by step, from $C0 to
$9 a case.

FLEETEST FOOTERS WILL MEET
AT OPENING OF SHEEPSHEAD BAY
HISTORIC and popular Sheeps
head Bay track will open its
gates to the public to-day with
the classic Suburban Handicap
as the magnet to attract thou
sands of Eastern turf goers. It gives
promise of furnishing a far better test of
equine speed and endurance than did the
Brooklyn Handicap, which was captured
by tbe three-year-old Conroy from a very
moderate field. Again this year the smart
ones pin thefr faith to the five-year-old
Ethelbert, and beyond cavil Perry Bel-
roy's good example it will have to
be Blues, but few like him after
his hard race in the Brooklyn
Derby. Beau Gallant, on what he
has shown this season, cannot be con-
sidered a contender. Toddy has estab-
Hshed a doubtful reputation, and if he
would only run one race as well as he
looks Mr. Keane would not regret the ab-
sence of Conroy. Toddy's last race was
an improvement, so perhaps the horse has
come to the conclusion that the race is
worth the winning. August Belmont re-
lies on Kilogram.

CLASSIC SUBURBAN HANDICAP THE
BIG RACING EVENT OF THE HOUR
SOME OF THE STARTERS IN
THE SUBURBAN HANDICAP
TO-DAY.
The annual cruise of the California
Yacht Club up the Sacramento River will
begin to-day. Already the sloop Pactolus
and the yawl Idler have made trips up
the river and have returned, the yachts
men reporting that the Sacramento is un
usually high and that the mosquitoes are
less numerous and troublesome than in
previous seasons. The yachts that will
start to-day, about 2:30 p. m. from the
narrow gauge mole, are Commodore S. S.
Marshall's sloou Thelma and George E.
Miller's sloop Occident. On board the
flagship will be the commodore, W. W.
Thompson. Carl Foard, R. A. Meserole
and C. A. Eteiily. while the crew of the
Occident will be her owner and A de
Witt. The yachts will make Martinez to
night and Sulsun to-morrow. Then they
will go through the cut-off into the Sac
ramento River, up which they -will cruise
as far as circumstances permit, returning
to Martinez or Port Costa next Saturday
and to their moorings in Oakland Creek
on the following day. â¢ â¢ *
The building of the yacht to challenge
for the Perpetual cup is not, as some have
supposed, to be undertaken by the San
Francisco Yacht Club, but- merely by a
syndicate of members of that club, the
directors assuming no responsibility for
the expense of construction or fitting out."
The idea Is to build the hull of the boat
in the strongest and most thorough man
ner, but to spend as little as possible on
interior fittings, which can be added later.
The yachts constructed on modern lines
in this bay. such as the . Tramontana and
the sloop Harpoon, have been ineffective
ly braced and have given constant trou
ble to their owners by leaking, which has
been a matter of great expense to rem
edy. The challenger being designed by a
man - thoroughly familiar with boats of
modern type will be very strong and sea
worthy and will make an excellent cruis
ing yacht for a private owner. That the
San Franciscos are in earnest and wish
to see a keen contest for the yachting blue
ribbon of San Francisco Bay is evident
from their Intention to challenge in the
30-foot class, in which the cup holders are
very strong, the sloops â¢ Presto, Aeolus
and Truant, which .have won between
them all the five Macdonough trophies at
the annual regattas of the Interclub As
sociation, being 30-footers. Had the San
Franciscos challeneged with the yawl

The absence of the great stake winning
courser Beacon from recent events has
caused the followers of the game to won
der where the rapid blue dog has taken
himself. Since the dissolution of the firm
of Curtis & Sons the name of Beacon
has not been offered in any of the stakes,
and rumor has it that the glad accept
ance would not be forthcoming if it were.
That Â¦ the firm had a great â¢- kennel of
coursing dogs no one will deny, but ac
cording to the way of thinking of the
senior Curtis no dog on the field was
capable' of getting a flag from any of. the
lot. More than once when a. decision
went against the liking of Mr. Curtis his
protestations could be heard in no mild
terms. Coupled with his objections would
come the insinuation of. fraud, whether
his dog was beaten in a close score or
pointless. For a while the fiery talk of
the old gentleman was taken as the nat
ural protest of a loser, until at last his
remarks became- personal and. insulting
and Claimed the attention of the directors
of the Union Park Association. He was
asked to desist or make good. some of his
wild charges, and answered back that the
park- would never have his dog Beacon on
its card again. Since the episode A. R.
Curtis . has purchased Beacon and has
him in his kennel. Whether -or not the
dog will be. allowed to .run. under the new
ownership without the apology .which
has been demanded of Curtis senior Is. a
question for the committee to answer.

Sir Thomas Lipton Willing
to Match His Shamrock II
Against the Constitution
in Contest of This "Kind
. LONDON. June 14.â When the attention
of Sir Thomas Lipton was called to-day
to a report that his secretary had an
nounced his willingness that the Sham
rock II should race with the Independ
ence lf a cup were offered, he replied that
he had made no arrangement for such a
race, but did not see why he should not
do so after his engagement with the New
York Yacht Club was concluded.
"What I would like to de," he said,'
"would be to arrange a race with the Con
stitution across the Atlantic after the
challenge races, whoever wins there. This
would be good sport and a fine test of sea
manship.
"I .have often heard this or that aa to
what could or could not be done- lf oie .
were in mid-ocean. Why not see? Such
a race would be an admirable test of the
stability of a yacht under varying condi
tions/'
NEW TORK. June 14.â The Intimation
of Sir Thomas Lipton that he would like
to. arrange a race across the Atlantic be
tween the Constitution and the Shamrock
II, after the international yacht races,
was conveyed to the members of the New-
York Yacht Club to-night. Great sur
prise was expressed/at the possibility of
such an undertaking.
j The question was raised by members
of the club as to whether or not the syndi
cate controlling the Constitution would
be open for further propositions of any
kind after the cup races were over. It i3
said the owners of the boat will put me
Constitution or the market as soon as her
function is performed, and it is seriously
debated at the yacht club whether or not
the managers of the boat would- arrange
for further races of any. nature.

LOS ANGELES.
LOS AXGELES, June 14.â Los Angeles
and Sar. Francisco played an exception
ally interesting game of ball to-day,
which resulted in favor of the local team
by a score of 2 to 1. Pabst lined out a
three-bagger into center field, which
passed Householder and was lost in a
hole under the fence, giving him. a home
run.
The game was two hours and a half in
duration, the longest of the season or any
other reason. Elmer Stricklett, the "pop
ular" Sacramento twirler. was responsi
ble foi the drawn out contest. He took
more pains In delivering the ball, and his
p> rations were slow if not graceful. The
.Senators were still sulky, but refrained
from talking back to the umpire, as it
was an expensive luxurv. The following
score will tell how it happened:

Good Ball at Los Angeles.
With two men out "Unhappy Joe" Mc-
Gucken came to bat and sent a nice one
to Francks. who, instead of throwing it
to first to make the third out and ending
the contest, threw high to Arrellanes at
second. Devereaux crossed the rubber on
the play and the score was tied^ Then
lianlon came to bat. The alleged "Wooden
Indian" came to life in this inning. He
landed on the ball and it soared over the
center-field fence and three men and him
self made the circuit. Babbitt became
difheartened and pitched easy ball. Three
baggers, two-base hits and singles were
made, and when the agonv was over the
t-eorer hit the bell eight times. It was a
sad ending to Ewing's hopes and his smile
was eclipsed by a frown. His men took
their last "licks" and went out in quick
order.
Lehman had smiled blandly at the um
pire throughout the game, but, like every
one else, he was on edge. He loudly In
sinuated that Tyler's eyesight was bad
because he called a strike a ball, and was
fined $5. The uncharitable Sacramento
aggregation howled in fiendish glee, and,
like Shylock, yelled "most learned, most
righteous judge." Devereaux then
i-lammed the ball out and reached first.
AlcLsuphlin gained first on a bunt and
Courtney fouled out, Lohman making a
*tar catch. Doyle was awarded a walk
and the bass were filled.
It was in the ninth inning. The score
was 3 to 2 In favor of the Beaus, and Cal
Ewing eat in the grand stand with a smile
that lighted up the surrounding bleachers.
Stanley had struck out and the spectators
Â¦were pulling hard for Oakland. Devereaux
was at bat and every one knew it. He
tried to disguise himself by a shorn mus
tache, but his topknot blazed forth in the
sun and he was known to the multitude.
Mr. Francks, who covers territory be
tween third and second for the Dudes,
will have no streets named after him
â¢when he retires from the diamond: that
Is, If his performance In yesterday's game
is taken Into consideration. He turned an
Oakland victory into an overwhelming de
feat by a piece of ball playing that would
not have done credit to a tyro at the
game.

Bowers of.Garvanza. holder for the past
two seasons of the women's championship
of Southern California, will make a bold
bid for the first women's championship of
all California, her most determined oppon
ent being Mrs. R. G. Brown, holder of the
ladies' cups of the San Francisco and San
Rafael Golf clubs.
The putting grounds at Burlingame have
been dressed with-oil 'sand, and are said
to be in excellent condition. The putting
grounds of the Fort Baker course afSau
salito are in pretty good condition, but the
fair green is still very rough, the revenue
from monthly, dues not being large enough
to employ two or three men constantly in
keeping down the thistles and thick grass.

THE California Jockey Club will
close Its winter and spring season
of racing to-day at the Oakland
track. As a special event the
Darktown Derby for tha choco
late stakes will be run, all the jockeys be
ing: gentlemen of dark complexional ef
fects. Kentucky John Givens will wield
the flag In this event. The entire card
will comprise seven races. The closing
days are drawing large crowds and the
wind-up of the season promises a gay day
at the track. : -
Beau Monde, the favorite at 3 to 1 in
' the first race yesterday, over six furlongs,
came up from the paddock and by a burst
passed Parsifal and Senator Matts with
ease. Parsifal got. well out In front at the
start and. led until the paddock, when
Beau Monde did the trick. Senator Matts
got the place. ' \ ' Â¦
You You was the second favorite to
come- under the wire. In the two-year
old maiden race after a, good start Ruiz
took You You to the front and there was
never any doubt about the race after that.
Flattered finished second three lengths.be
hind, Dawson Coming in for the show.'
Bagdad, with Ruiz up, rolled in for the
first money in the third race. Dr. Boyle
was the preludal good thing, being backed
down from 8 to 5 to even money soon after
the chalking began. Bagdad, at 2 to 1
went to 13 to 10 at post call, when several
packages of money floated Into the ring.
Searchlight getting off well Â« made the
place and Onyx the show.
Glendenning, another noised about good
thing, burned up money in the fourth
race. B. C. Greene took the lead, with
Glendenning at close haul. When the
stretch was reached Glendenning looked
the sure winner, but Tyranus at 10 or 12
to 1 forged ahead, bound after bound, and
took the purse by a scant nose. Ino
cencia, quietly whispered about the ring
as something mellow, made the show.
.The flfth event brought the third victory
to Ruiz, mounted on Saul of Tarsus, 18 to
5 being the closing price. Almoner, the
favorite, got off well, but fell back grad
ually, finishing fifth. Mamie Hildreth. off
last, made up enough to carry the show
money.
In the sixth race Dangerous Maid took
the lead soon after the start. Racetto
tacking on. When the stretch was
reached Racetto was in advance of the
Maid, but was beaten out at the finish.
Donator got the show.

Discussing public^ sentiment on the subject the
Charleston correspondent of the Baltimore Sun says:
"Frien'ds of Governor McSweeney. throughout South
Carolina have' recently been loud in their commenda
tion of his act in returning their resignations to Sena
tors. Tillman and McLaurin: There is a*big political
move in this, however, and Mr. McSweeney is ex
pected to profit by it next summer when he goes be
fore the people as a candidate for the Senate. The
people who have really sent up the loudest praise of
the Governor are the personal supporters of .., Me-.
Laurin. This element recognized that the junior Sen
ator did not have a bit of a show in *a battle with
Tillman this yearand-is naturally rejoicing. that the
great fight. will not take place. .The McLaurin shout
ers, with the close friends of Governor 'McSweeney,
who want to make him solid for the- race next year,
have' been trying to express the sentiment of the
State, but the great volume of Tinman backers has
kept quiet;" ; " â¢ _.- : â¢-.- â¢''.,>
..' It thus appears the Governor called off the contest
Tiot because he has any pbj ection' : to>/ the . excitement it
would have caused. but because, he wo^id. 'have had
no, chance to share in it' and make a, struggle, for. the
stakes.' 'Next -year the contest will'. not be? between
Tiliman^and. McLaurin only. It vyill b'e a freejfor-all
struggle and the redoubtable McS>v.eettey r wilL.'be in

suffered not a loss of her expected conflict, -but 'only, a
postponement of it.-j Let her content herself this sum
mer with eating watermelons in the shade.. . Next .sum- 1
mer she will have a hot time. ' ,
By the nation at large the whole controversy has
been well nigh forgotten and people, are talking of
other things; but down, in South Carolina they are
still wondering and speculating how it happened that
a promised Â¦'political duel â¢ so quickly turned into a
foot' race for cover. The perplexing point in the
problem is the action of the Governor. At -the time
he asked the angry Senators to .recall their resigna
tions he gave as a reason for doing so that he did
not wish to subject the people of the State. to the ex
citement of an intense campaign during the heat. of
the summer. There are people in the Stated who de
cline to'accept that explanation with simple faith and
declare a conviction that, it is nothing more than
buncombe. . -
SO\JTH CAROLINA IMBROGLIO.
WHEN Senators Tillman and McLaurin sent
their resignations to Governor McSweeney
there was a thrill of expectancy in the coun
try. Everybody looked to have the' dullness of the
summer season brightened up a bit by a fierce and
furious campaign in South; Carolina. Wh.en the Gov
ernor declined to accept the resignations and advised
their withdrawal there was a sense of disappointment,
and when Tillman, swearing he 'would ne'er consent,
consented to recall his letter and retain his seat all
hope of a fight was over, but there was still a belief
that McLaurin "would stay in the ring as a challenger
and make it lively for the man with the pitchfork.
When at last he withdieiv the affair was at an end and
the country: knew it had been humbugged by a politi
cal farce. â¢'Â»"Â¦...
â¢From these figures some philosophers draw the*con
clusion that the British race,, like the French, has
passed, the period of its highest fertility and has
started on the decline. It may be the facts cited can
be explained upon some other hypothesis than that of
a diminished fertility, but. if. so it is-curious that the
diminution should. have occurred so generally in all
parts of the world where the* British races have settled
and colonized The one factthat stands in opposition
to the theory is that the birth rate among the whites
of the Southern States,- who are an almost purely Brit
ish.people, having. but-little admixture from foreign
immigration, continues to be large. ' In other sections
of the Union the descendants of the original British
colonists' have been ; so blended with other races that
their birth rate can hardly, be considered in this con
nection. We have, then, the facts that outside the
South the birth; rate of the British races and their
descendants, when urimixed with other, races, has de
cjined in all parts,: of â¢ the world, and it would seem,
therefore, that the theory' of a 'loss of fertility is not
an unreasonable one.
It would be a curious thing if the Anglo-Saxon race',
which has met the new century with the' proud expec
tation of dominating the world before the century
closes,* should suddenly^ cease to multiply in propor
tion to other. races and lose its prestige among the
peoples of the earth. .It is to be noted there is no
diminution of the birth rate among the Italians or the
Germans. The rapid increase of the Italian* race of
recent years has been, in fact, one of the 'marvels of
Europe./ : In spite of a heavy emigration that has car
ried millions' 6f -Italians into' every progressive coun
try in Europe and to "all' parts! of and. South
America; the population of Italy has in twenty years
advanced- 'from 21,000,000. to 35,ooo,ooo. There has
been of 'late much talk of "decadent" races; and now
the' statistical [experts are intimating that -the mighty
â¢Anglo-Saxon \may have j to] be included among them.
The diminished birth rate of the. British Canadians
is regarded by students of population' as the. more,
significant because it : corresponds with a similar de-'
cline among the British peoples, of other countries
In the New England States, for example, it has long,
been noted that. the". old families of so-called "native 1
Americans"â that is. to. say, the people of British
descentâ have actually ceased to multiply, ; and in
some New England* localities the death, rate among
them is higher than the birth rate. The recent "census
in England shows that the tiirth rate* there in. 1899
â¢was- but .29.3- per -'thousand inhabitants as compared
with 35.6 in 1878. Furthermore, Australian reports
show a decrease in 'the birth. rate there. Thus it ap
pears that in old England and in New England, in the
climate of Canada and.in the climate of Australia, and
under all the varying conditions of those widely
separated countries, the Anglo-Saxon birth rate has
begun "to fall below the standards of the past.
CANADA is dissatisfied with the census returns
of her population. While the complete re
turns have not yet been compiled, the results
of the count thus far lead to the conclusion that in
stead of a population of upward of 6,000,000; as was ex
pected, the returns will show hardly more than 5,500,
000. The most depressing feature of the count, how
ever, is the revelation that while the birth rate of the
French element of the population is high,' that of the
British ; races in the Dominion has fallen during the
past decade much below what" it was in former years.

Speeches like these recall the eloquence with which
Chatham. Camden and Barre opposed the : insensate
war of King George upon the American colonies, and
they may be read by Englishmen hereafter with re
gret that their warning , was. not needed. 'In the mean
time, however,, the. stolid Briton goes or sending
more and more reinforcements to Kitchener, and the
wasting war continues to consume life "and treasure
despite all the appeals that impassioned eloquence" can
make. 1 * - . " "
In the course of his speech Mr. .Morley was
taunted with being a "little" En glander," and.in-re
plying to the- taunt 4se said: - "I quote again a"Yen
tence from a great divine: 'Things are what they are',
and their consequences 'will be what they will be.
Why then seek to deceive ourselves?' Wear out your
coal, pile up your debt, multiply and' magnify your
responsibilities in every part of the globe, starve so
cial reforms among your people at home, and- then
indeed you will have a little England,- a: dilapidated
heritage, to hand on to your children and your chil
dren's children." - . , .
That Frederic Harrison is not the only eloquent
Englishman" who regards the war with abhorrence and
detestation is made evident by the recent speech of
John Morley in the House of Commons.. Referring
to the statesmen who brought about the war he said:
"Were not your advisers and inspirers dreaming when
they launched you on this business? The expenditure
of this 150 millions has brought not what British
statesmen wanted, but precisely -what they did not
want. It has brought about havoc and ruin, material
havoc and material ruin, unspeakable, unquenched,
and for long unquenchable racial animosity, a task of
political reconstruction of incomparable difficulty. All
the other consequences I need not dwell upon of, this
war, which you must let me call, as I think, a hateful
war, a war insensate and infatuated, a war of uncom
pensated mischief and irreparable wrong." u3r3
The actual conflict Mr. Harrison describes as "a
wasting and savage war which has gone on for nearly
twenty months with no visible result except the
slaughter of nyriads of men, the waste of Â£150,000,000,
ruin, devastation and famine broadcast over the very
country we pretend to call a part of our empire, and
deadly. -hatred 'planted, in a race^ of men that" never'
forgety-\yhom we pretend to .call our fellow citizens."
As a further explanation of the cause of his panoplied
hatred he adds: "Not only are we being ruined,
humiliated and made" odious as a nation, but we are
being made tne laughing-stock of the world. This
grotesque fooling for party ends is transforming us
into a race of blackguards. Tne disgusting orgies of
Mafeking and carnivals were encouraged and financed
by politicians and advertising' tradesmen. They were
blessed by the clergy of thafchurch which assures us
that *God made war.* Soldiers who have violated the
law of nations, and have left the field of their so
called conquests a scene of chaos and confusion,
swept by incessant and aimless fighting, are hailed as
if they vrere the saviors of the country. Generals who
have suffered humiliating defeats, over which the civ
ilized world has made merry, vapor about at bazaars
and garden, parties as Jieroes and heaven-born com
manders." Â¦ â¢ . -V
Mr. Harrison declares the origin of the war "is the
old struggle for ascendency â just, the claim of the
Orange Protestant minority in Ireland to bring to
heel , the Catholic native race." He speaks of it as
"a stupendous folly, an abominable crime, into which
British adventurers have plunged the empire," and
says: "They rigged the political market, theyÂ«-gave
commissions to leading politicians, they hired the
press in Africa and Â«\t home, they poured out on the
public ear a torrent of calumny and sensational false
hoods, they organized a foul act of piracy, they bullied
and blaclcmailed the /department,* they made the rep
resentative .of the crown their creature. This respon
sible Governor of a self-governing colony stooped" to
play the part which; some noble chairman of a rotten
company performs as the figurehead of a board of
guinea-pig " directors. * * * He .mouthed out
rhetorical abuse of the Government with .which he
was sent to negotiate, and when he saw the possibil
ity of a peaceful issue of the imbroglio he had fanned
he took care to make a' settlement impossible, and
war the natural result" \
1-VREDERIC HARRISON recently declared that
t~"< he ano his supporters in Great Britain regard
Â¦*Â¦. the war against the Boers with "panoplied
hatred," and, having been called upon to explain, has
done so in something like, 3000 words of such a de
nunciation of "the infamous, war" as has hardly been
uttered by the fiercest of the Boers themselves. - T i

The Norniaraiid Industrial Institute at

of the Legislature in 18S0, and has since
without Interruption, received aid from
the State. On July. 4. 1881, it began its re
markable' career under the superinten
dence of Booker T. "Washington. The se
ries of autobiographical papers that re
cently appeared -in the Outlook and â¢ at
tracted such wide and favorable attention
gives a graphic account, humorous, pa
thetic, thrilling, of the difficulties which
attended the inauguration of the enter
prise and .of the persistence,' courage
ability, hopefulness and faith which have
characterized Booker T. Washington. He
is now almost as well known as any man
in the United States, and Harvard Uni

Since, the genesis of this institution in 1S81

and his work, and I doubt whether anv

time f such marvelous and deserved tri
umph. Forty buildings for overSOO stu
dents have been erected, and these from
the drawing of the plans to the putting

most- wholly 'the product of : student
labor. All who enter the. institute must
learn some industry., A knowledge of all
the steps; of the progress only enhances

sive control . of female teachers. Many
persons | regard â¢ it as, on the whole, the
most - successful aDd admirable school in
the South. It Is so excellent as to escape
adverse criticism from the most censori
ous. As far back as 1884 and 1886 Dr. Hay
good said: "The general agent wishes to
add as to the work done at Spelman; he
does , not know any school where money
goes farther^ in doing good. One could
hardly exaggerate *a statement- of the
good accomplished In this school." Dr
Glenn, _the able Superintendent of Schools
in Georgia," has often spoken in most eulo
gistic terms of the discipline, 1 the instruc
tion,the atmosphere, the most wholesome
influence of this school, and after twenty
years of close observation, and annual in
spection I take great pleasure in repeating
this praise. V -
The institute . was a pioneer in. indus
trial training, and is among the best ex
ponents of this new movement in educa
tionJ To meet the needs of the negro this
necessary adjunct, . this essential part of
his education, was introduced and cor
related with academic training. The in
dustries are not a kind of play, are not
merely intended as helpful in making a
living, although that is very important,
but they are Intended to cultivate as well
true art in its refining and artistic effects.
The girl pupils are encouraged and stimu
lated to make their rooms models of good
housekeeping, and every nook and corner
must, be kept in readiness for dally in

agricultural instruction, all the depart

Sktpticism as to the mental capability of
a race kept continuously, from time imme
morial, in a state of ignorance, supersti

try for 200 years, without schools' or ade

haps unavoidable. Prejudices engendered

Congressional legislation and - criminal
neglect by the Federal Government of
those whose emancipation and citizenship
logically and humanely involved a result

negro of the benefits which should have

Numerous inquiries as Uo the character
and methods of r the Peabody education
fund and for copies of the letter 5 of gift
have reached me. . Tulane, in the contri
bution which . resulted in Tulane Univer
sity, states that he was moved thereto by
the success of the Peabody fund. \, Mr.
Slater makes distinct personal acknowl
edgment', of the encouragement to the
execution of the long-cherished purpose
of h4s charitable foundation which derived
from the eminent wisdom and success
that had marked the conduct of that fund
in a field of operation no,f remote from
that contemplated by him.Y.
It was fortunate that Df*. -D. C. Gilman,
the able and scholarly president of Johns
Hopkins University, was the friend and
adviser i of Mr. Slater,' for when consulted
he was able to give the benefit of his large
and varied educational experience, his
sound" judgment and his , sagacious wis
dom. He sketched for Mr. Slater an out
line of the objects within 1 the range of
accomplishment by such a trust 'and thus
gave clearness and shape to the ideas- and
wishes which were unformulated in the
mind of the founder. Dr. Bacon's pen put
in final form the letter, which bears date
March 4, 1892, and was addressed to
Messrs. Hayes, Waite, Dodge, Brooks,
Gilman, Stewart, Colquit> Jesup, Boyce
and William A. Slater. These gentlemen
were invited to procure a charter under
which they might organize, and Mr. Mor
ris K. Jesup, with whom Mr. Slater had
conferred freely as to the character of
the securities ' to be transferred, pro
ceeded to Albany and secured the requisite
act of incorporation, , liberal in its pro
visions and exempting the property and
all investments and . reinvestments, ex
cepting real estate, from taxation of any
and every nature. This forethought and
influence have been a great saving to the
fund. ~
Organizing for Work.
The first meeting of the trustees was
held May 18, 1882, in New York City, with
ex-President Hayes, who had been desig
nated by the donor as president of the
board, in the chair. According to by
laws promptly adopted, Chief ., Justice
Waite became the vice president.' ~ Mr.
Jesup the treasurer and Dr. D.<C. Gilman
the secretary. Mr. Slater himself was
present at this meeting and paid over to
the trustees the sum of $l,000.t>00, of which
$520,750 was invested in railroad bonds, and
the remainder was in money. The letter
of gift designated, as ttte general object
to be exclusively pursued, "the uplifting
of -the lately emancipated -population of
the Southern States and their posterity by
conferring, on them the blessings of Chris
tian education." It was not only for the
sake of the negroes but also for the safety
of our common country that Mr. Slater
was desirous to to aid the f reetlom by
"providing them with the means of such
education as shall tend to make them good
men' and good citizens." The lines of op
eration to be followed in the then con
dition of things were "the training of
teachers from among the people requiring
to be. taught and the encouragement of
such institutions as are most effectually
useful in promoting the training of teach
ers." ' Â¦ \ -v â¢Â¦Â¦â¢;Â¦
From the first meeting, with the cordial
approbation of Mr. Slater, until the pres
ent time, the trustees have construed their
instructions as . requiring that . the
scholars in aided schools "shall be trained
in some manual' occupation . simultane-.
ously with their mental and moral instruc
tion." and that in aiding "such schools
as are best fitted to prepare young colored
men and. women. to become useful. to their
race," those should be "carefully sought
out and preferred which give instruction
in trades and other manual occupations."
Efforts of Dr. Haygood.
Atticus G. Haygobd, D. D., of Georgia,'
was selected in October* 18S2, as general
agent, and the board soon approved a plan
of operations, as outlined by him, for car
rying out the directions contained in the
letter of gift. With great activity, enthu
siasm and ability, Dr. Haygood prosecuted
the delicate and difficult duties with which
he had been charged. ' He aroused a
larger and more enlightened interest in
the education of "our brother in black,"
was regarded as a special benefactor and
friend of the race, .because of his judi
cious counsel, his large sympathies 1 and
his boldness and eloquence in pleading for
right and justice. He traveled thousands
of miles, visiting leading institutions in
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennes
see, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louis
iana and -Texas, and acquired an amount
and accuracy : of - information on the sub
ject of negro education not surpassed by
that of any other man in the country.
â¢ As the result of earnest arid intelligent
study his convictions were strengthened
as to industrial - training "affording the
means of making a more self-reliant and
self-supporting population and necessary
as- furnishing some of the conditions of
the best intellectual and moral discipline
of the colored- peopleâ especially of those
who are to be the teachers and guides of
their people." What he saw as to the in
ferior quality of most - of the teaching
done in the public schools for the negro
children illustrated forcibly the - wisdom
and patriotism of Mr. Slater in requiring
the use of his means for the encourage
ment of 'institutions useful in the training
of teachers. Dr. Haygood, was confirmed
also in the opinion of himself . and the
board that best results would be attained
not >by diffusion of 'the available in
come, 1 but by, concentration upon a com
paratively, small number -of Institutions.
This judgment has been more strictly ad
hered . to in later years, with results too
obviously beneficial to be disputed To
those who know the , facility with which
schools,- hardly such^ except in name, are
started - in ; hundreds - of places - and how
solicitors are kept in every Northern
State, and-, town earnestly and sometimes
wickedly begging for help which is used
for personal benefit, and how tnany thou
sands of dollars have been * worse than
wasted upon pathetic but unworthy ap
peals, an argument cannot be necessary
to vindicate or enforce a resolution of the
trustees, "that no money be appropriated
to institutions. that are nqt, with good rea
son, believed to be on a permanent basis "
and that appropriations to schools and
colleges should be dependent upon a like
or larger suimbeing raised for the same
specific purpose by the parties Interested

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS
' A~ L0^ G - ith *- "current reports' of railroad
ZA' combinations 'and traffic deals there come
Â¦*- V others which will be 'received by the public
i with more satisfaction.* /Severafpf the great lines have
entered upon a â¢ systematic improvement of their "sta
tion buildings, so as^'to add to the convenience of the
passengers, and in- many instances the ; improvement
will consist in the construction of an entire new edifice
which will be an ornament to the town in -which it
stands. .
In addition .to.improvements' of a purely utilitarian
kind it is 'announced that the New York Central has
adopted a plan; for . making the T grounds around its
stations attractive by grass, shrubbery 1 arid flowers.
Of course the idea is- not new. A great many stations
in the United States and a 'considerable number in
California are already adorned to some extent by such
gardens, but it appears that the Central intends to un
dertake the work on a more comprehensive scale than
has ever before been tried in America. It is stated
that a landscape gardener .has -been appointed to
superintend the* work -along the whole line of the road,
and .it'^is believed that under his management every
station will be made attractive and satisfying to 1 the'
eye., g '-''" '-..' Â¦ -/. . ~> ..." .
'. A more notable experiment is reported to have been
decided upon' by the Illinois Central. It is said to
have equipped a train with the machinery for - con
structing sample stretches of highway , and will send^
it out to give 'object lessons in good road building all
the way from Chicago to New: Orleans. The railroad
has furnished the train with transportation for r the
equipment' arid party, including sleeping and commis
sary facilities for eighteen people, besides six laborers
who are with the train. v Seven .manufacturers of road-:
making machinery have contributed the apparatus
which will be used, and share the expense of the ex
pedition for the purpose of making their machinery
known. Each sends a competent marv
The work of road construction is to be 1 done under
the direction of President; Moore of .the National
Good Roads Association, assisted by a representative
of the Department of Agriculture. It is therefore well
assured that the "object lessons' giVen will be of value
to the communities through which the road passes,^
and may lead to extensive highway improvements that
will materially benefit the nation at large.
The undertaking of these various works on the part
of railroads, will* of course be received with no little
gratification. Their good effects will eventually reach
us. The Southern Pacific has 'already begun improv
ing its stations through the State, and perhaps it will
ere long, occur to the officials That it is high time to,,
give San Francisco, a passenger depot worthy of the
travel that passes through it. Â¦
RAILROAD ; OB JEGT'. LESSON.
T VER*5ince' Senator Lodge made at the 'opening
"^ qJ the -.Buffalo Exposition his much discussed
j Â¦â¢â ' "speech of warning to _. Europe, to keep out of
South. America, "accompanied by an ' intimation ! that
we may yet liave to go to war to maintain the Monroe
doctrine, there has beer, a great deal of speculation
as to what power he looks upon as a probable antago
nist. In the absence of "any explanation from the'
Senator himself," which is not to be' expected, public
opinion has come to the conclusion that he. meant
Germany. The reasons for the conclusion are that the
Germans have. extensive interests in Brazil and other
South -American countries, are known to be desirous â¢
of obtaining colonies, and an empire, and are sup-
Rosed to be antagonistic to the United States.
Such antagonism as exists is nothing more than the
outcome of the opposition of German -farmers to the
importation of American, farm products.. It is a com-,
merciar rivalry, merely and is not directed toward the
United States any moire i than toward Russia, Argen
tine,^Austplia;or*any other grain and meat producing
.country. > If; it* have >been expressed- more loudly,
against;us than' against the -others, the explanation
will be found in the'fact that our competition *s the
more extensive and the more feared.
There is apparently no reason, for believing the.
Germans -have ..any, intention of violating the Mon
roe doctrine or of forcing us to go to war to defend
it. Referring to statements that the Germain.Govern
ment is trying to obtain coaling stations" in this
hemisphere the ! Cologne Gazette recently .said: "A
naval or coaling station could be of 'value only if it
furnished a base for. our fleet. ' Americans might
kindly consider how great the naval force is that we
maintain in these waters. -As a rule it consists of one, s
or: at most two, little cruisers, and now and again a
training or cadet ship strays into this part Â¦ of Â¦ the <
world. Why, then, should we, for such a small num
ber of ships, desire to; acquire a coaling station? The
cost of administration would swallow up more than
any possible profit in coal, and. a naval station, with
arsenals, docks, etc., would be a still worse' invest
ment. Such an installation would be unproductive and
impractical in the highest degree, and if. the United
States should ask us in the most' friendly fashion to
take possession of such an island we would decline
such, a gift with thanks." ... Â¦
While the German press disclaims any desire * for
coaling stations, or any intentions of aggression in this
hemisphere, the representatives of South American
countries just as emphatically disclaim any fear, on
their part that such aggressions might be- committed.
Thus Baron Rio Branco of Brazil is quoted as saying:
"While the Germans in the three southern provinces,'
Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catherina and Parana, are
numerous and exert a certain influence, the Brazilian
population is in the majority and Brazilian political
influence is dominant. The Hanseatic colonization,
company, which alone systematically encourages Ger-~
man immigration to the extensive lands it has-ac
quired, cannot find Germans .to settle there, and has
been forced to send for Swiss, Austrians, Russians
and even Boers. The talk about German designs upon
Brazil is the merest twaddle."
It may be taken, then, as well settled that there is
no antagonism between Germany and America over
the- Monroe doctrine or anything else. The next time
Senator Lodge makes a speech of that kind. he should
either be' more careful of what he says or more spe
cific as to his charges.

Journeymen Butchers Demand the
Discharge of Non-Union
Men.
SACRAMENTO, June 14.â The Journey
men butchers of Sacramento have served
written notice upon the employing butch
ers of this city that on and after July 1
they will not work with non-union men,
and that the - employing butchers must
discharge such non-union men and em
ploy union men in! their places.
Last night the employing butchers met
and considered the demand. Their policy
will probably be to await developments.
Should one of their number be boycotted,
however, it is declared that ,they will
make common cause against the journey
men waging it. "While they do not say
so, it is believed to be the intention i of
the' employing butchers to await devel
opments .in the San Francisco situation
before taking action. The union men say
that they, will do nothing with respect to
requiring union cards to be posted In tiie
shopr. until their present demand is acted
upon. . '.vi.Vlfe?:*?
ULTIMATUM IN SACRAMENTO.
ALTHOUGH the press committee
of the striking journeymen butch
ers takes a_ hopeful view of the
situation, yeCit was admitted by
them yesterday that the action
alleged to have been taken by the whole
sale butchers regarding union cards had
slightly disturbed the programme. It was
said that an ultimatum had been issued
by the wholesalers that every union card
would have to be taken down at a certain
hour. The penalty for failure to comply
would be the shutting "oir of meat. In'ad
dition to this it was announced that even
after the card had been removed, it might
in some instances be sixty days before a
new supply could be had.
The journeymen butchers left their hall
shortly after noon and proceeded to
Butchertown, where the streets in the im
mediate vicinity of the slaughter houses
were paraded. A number of the places
were running,, some of the wholesale
butchers having secured crews, and in
other places the proprietors and butchers
from neighboring towns made up the
force. The usual demonstrations of dis
approval were made in front of these
places.
On the return of the strikers to the city
a delegation of the retail butchers, who
had been notified, went into an executive
conference with the strike committee to
consider the -ultimatum regarding - the
cards and remained in session until a late
hour. .
According to the press representative of
the striking butchers when the demands
were first formulated they were sent to
a committee of the retailers and a number
of changes were suggested. A conference
was called and the cttanges accepted. In
the matter of the union card its display
was left optional. It was found a greo't
advantage to the butcher shops in the
laboring districts, and butchers who re
fused to display the card complained.
These complaints were brought to the at
tention of the conference committees, and
it was decided thatt unless the card was
displayed in every shop the men would
walk out. There are about 288 shops in ihe
city, and about half of them were affected
by this additional requirement.
No Scarcity of Help.
According to the leading retailers there
is no scarcity of help, many of the men
returning to work at the places they left
on Monday.
"There is no scarcity of help," said Mr.
Hammond of the Spreckels market. "I
will take a contract to supply forty mem
bers of the -union ready to go back at
once. My old men are asking to be taken
back, and I have not a union card in my
safe or under my counter or any place
else around the premises."
The pickets who were sent out yester
day were not as numerous as they were
the day before, .nor were as many men
in attendance at the meetings. The police
officers who were on duty in boycotted
places had nothing to do.
It was officially announced at the head
quarters of the Journeymen Butchers'
Union last night after a meeting of the
executive committee, which went into
session late in the afternoon, that the no
tification from the wholesale butchers ad
dressed to all dealers. having union cards
would go into effect this morning at 10
o'clock'. It was claimed that this would
not have any effect on the men that
were out. as the butchers thus deprived
would get meat anyhow.
Exchanging With Oakland.
It was announced that large quantities
of beef were being shipped from this city
to Oakland to supply the union shops
there and that Oakland was reciprocating
by sending mutton here. It was also
claimed that this supply could be indefi
nitely continued.
"Not a slaushter-house Is running in
Butchertown." raid the spokesman for
the striking butchers, "with anything like
a full crew. Salesmen, wagon drivers
and proprietors and their relatives are
working, but as they Â«Io not belong to
any union we cannot call them out. There
is not a hog or sheep butcher^ at work.
The refrigerators are full of meat, but
that was killed before the strike took ef
fect. The statement that these slaughter
houses are running Is false and mali
cious."
While this was the official statement,
some men around the headquarters were
loud in declaring their intention of going
to work at once. Their individual utter
ances differed greatly from those made
by the executive committee.
It was denied that any union shops had
returned their cards, although a list of
four firms which had already been refused
meat was posted. The union slaughter
house will endeavor to supply them. Most
of these shops are located in the southern
part of the city. .
a " T THE. meeting of :the San Fran-
J\ Cisco Labor Council last night it
A>\ was reported by the Iron Trades
A Y\. Council that word had been re
ceived from a certain shop em
ploying forty men that the shop would be
unionized to-day. President McCabe said
the message Â¦ announcing this change of
base on the part of the firm was a verbal
one, and that the name of the firm would
not be announced until the unioi agree
ment had been signed.
Delegate Dijeau, business agent of the
Milk Drivers' Union, reported that at
tempts had been made to form a com
bination against the dairies and their
drivers. who were supplying union houses,
but the plan was frustrated.
Delegate Harris of the Metal Polishers'
Union created quite a stir by saying when
the demand for. eight hours was. granted
them the Labor Council demanded Â¦- the
display of the union card, and then the
men went, on strike, and had been losing
wages ever since and he was getting tired
of it.
' A dispute arose over the question of the
action of the musicians employed in non
union restaurants, and as the representa
tives of the Butchers* Union appeared the
Council went into executive session. In
order that the situation might be pri
vately discussed, a guard was placed at
the outer " door, and all outsiders were
kept at a distance. ;
In Executive Session. .
All the phases of the labor situation
were Â¦ discussed for over an hour, . but no
definite action further than referring the
matter of strike to the executive . com
mittee was taken. - :. : .
The Porters' and Packers' reported that
their recently adopted schedule had been
presented to their employers, July 1 being
selected as the date for its inception. -
At the request of the representatives
of the Teamsters' Union .an intention to
declare a boycott against the Morton
Special Delivery Company was carried.
According to the statements made by the
teamsters' representatives, as soon as one
of the emplojes of this company joins the
union his place "is instantly tilled by a
non-union . man. Representatives of the
Labor Council called upon the managers
of the company, but were not granted a
hearing. Final action will not be taken
until next Friday night. â - - â¢
Delegates from the newly organized
union of drivers of steam laundry, work
ers were admitted.
Music â¢ in Restaurants.
In the restaurants employing orchestras
the men have been notified that if the
Musicians' Union insists upon their re
fusing to play in "certain unfair houses,
they must leave their jobs. The principal
places affected are Zlnkand's and the
Louvre. At the former place Fred Zln
kand in response to a question said:
"Our men will work righ^ along. Their
week is up on Wednesday night, and I
am sure they will not leave us."
Mr. Zinkand declined to say whether
the men had been notified to leave the
union or lose their positions, as his father
was away and had conducted the nego
tiations.
The Labor Day celebration committee
of the Building Trades Council held Â¦ an
enthusiastic meeting at the Turk -street
Temple. Reports were received from
members of the Building Trades in Oak
land, Sacramento, San Jose and Stockton
promising large delegations. The exer
cise and games will be held at Shell
Mound- Park. Over 700 prizes have already
been secured. Several labor spellbinders
have been communicated with and it Is
expected that there will be many favor
able responses.

No one uttered a sound as Baca was
led to the position allotted him beside
the wall. An officer loaded five of the
guns with blank cartridges and the cham
bers of five were loaded with cartridges
containing full charges of powder and
leud. While this operation was being per
formed Baca was bound hand and foot
and a heavy band was placed over his
eyes. Â¦ He was stood up with his face to
the wall and his back to the troops. Then
the voice of tho officer rang out clear and
steady giving the command to fire. The
men fired as one and the body of the
Texan toppled over and lay upon the
ground, riddled by bullets.
The merchant was possessed of a j'oung
and comely wife, whose devotion to her
husband was such'that instead of seeking
safety in flight when the raiders appeared
she remained by his side and pleaded with
the brutes to stay their hands. After
they had apparently glutted their cruel
instincts on the husband they turned their
attention to the wife, whom they shame
fully mistreated.
Toward daybreak the men mounted
their horses and rode swiftly away to
ward the border, leaving the merchant
and his wife more dead than alive. Soon
after the occurrence the Mexican author
ities got on the trail of the raiders and
learned they had returned to Texas. The
United States officials were notified, and
a few months later Samuel Baca was ar
rested. He was tried before a Commis
sioner here and extradited on April 11 of
the present year. The Chihuahua courts
found him guilty and the higher court af
firmed the decision. Last Monday morn
ing at daybreak he was led from his cell
to the patio in the interior of the Chi
huahua prison. A squad of ten picked
men under command of a lieutenant had
already been drawn up .in line at a dis
tance of ten paces from one of the thick
walls.
Baca was an American citizen, born
and reared in Texas, and hls j stamping
ground when he reached the age of ma
turity was .the valley adjacent to Mar
fa, Tex. One night last August he and a
half-dozen friends made a raid across the
border into Mexico. Well armed and
mounted, they rode to the house of a
Mexican merchant and demanded his
money. The merchant had accumulated
considerable property and the members of
the gang were convinced that he had
money concealed on the premises. He re
fused to disclose the hiding place of the
treasure and was brutally tortured by the
gang. With the ferocity of fiends they
seared his flesh with hot irons and used
a keen-bladed knife to mutilate him. He
finally yielded and told where they would
find the money. They took possession of
it, but were not satisfied with the torture
already inflicted.
EL PASO, Tex., June 14.â Samuel Baca
has paid the penalty of his crimes with
his life. He was blindfolded and stood
up against a wall and shot to death by a
squad of Mexican soldiers. This was the
sentence of the tribunal at Chihuahua,
and it was put into effect at daybreak on
June 10. ' -

Another Overdue Ship Arrives.
The American ship Henry B. Hyde ar
rived from Baltimore Thursday night
after a long run, for her, of 153 days.
Soon after she passed Cape Henry last
January a partially dismantled American
ship was passed by a steamer bound for
New York, and when the Hyde did not
show up on her usual time her owners
thought she might have lost some of her
spars and was coming along under a jury
rig. The Hyde was In some very heavy
weather and lost nearly a suit of sails.
Besides she got no southeast trades, and
that fact was in a measure the cause of
the delay.
Captain McLeod reports, strong south
erly gales after passing Cape Henry and
poor northeast trades, and very poor
southeast trades to Cape St. John. After
doubling St. John a succession of terrific
gales were run into, during which sails
were torn from the bolt ropes and others
were split into tatters. The deck was
swept of everything movable, and several
of the crew were slightly hurt. After
rounding the Horn some more heavy
weather was met with, and then when the
southeast trade winds should have been
picked up nothing but southwest and
north breezes blew. The equator was
crossed on May 10 in longitude 119 degrees
37 minutes west. From that on there was
only the usual weather. A good north
erly breeze carried the Hyde to latitude
35 degrees 37 minutes north, longitude 140
degrees 10 minutes west, and then there
were four days of calms, succeeded by
seven days of strong east and east-south
east winds; thence to port strong north
and west winds. The Hyde brings 3655
tons of coal for John Rosenfeld's Sons.
Wisconsin's Final Speed Contest.
The battleship Wisconsin went outside
to have a five hours' continuous test yes
terday. It is now six months since the
Government accepted her, and this is the
final test called for by the contract.
Picked coal was put aboard yesterday.
During the run from Puget Sound the
warship got a splendid limbering up.
After passing out yesterday she was
headed up the coast and at once plunged
Into the northwester that has been blow
ing at the rate of from forty to sixty
miles an hour for. the past ten days.
Just when the Wisconsin will have her
five hours' trial is not known, but it will
probably be some time to-day, as she is
expected back in port to-morrow morn
ing.
The Oregon. Iowa and Philadelphia will
be open to the public this afternoon and
also to-morrow afternoon. Boats will run
from the landing at the foot of Folsom
street every, ten minutes, commencing at
1 p. m., each' day.
Captain Thomas of the Oregon received
a very handsome loving cup on behalf of
the ship last Thursday. It was sent by
Mrs. Percy T. Morgan, who when she was
Miss Daisy AInsworth of Portland chris
tened the great fighting machine. There
was no ceremony connected with the af
fair. The loving cup, accompanied by a.
note, was delivered at the shfp's side by
a messenger boy, and that was all there
was to it.
Salvors for Pyrenees "Wanted.
The owners of the British four-masted
steel bark Pyrenees want another attempt
made to get the" vessel out of the lagoon
at Manga Reva Island. It will be remem
bered that she left the coast with a cargo
of grain and was next heard of at Pit
calm with the cargo on nre. No means
of fighting the flames could be procured
from the Islanders, so the captain ran for
Manga Reva. On arriving on* the reef the
vessel was headed inshore, and after
striking hard once or twice brought up in
the lagoon, where she went ashore. The
fire burned Itself out and the crew aban
doned the wreck and went * to Tahiti,
where they took ship for San Francisco.
Soon after the arrival of Captain Bryce
the remains of the vessel were offered at
auction and were purchased by Eschen &
Minor of this city. The owners would not
confirm the sale and now want some one
to try and get the vessel off and bring her
to San Francisco. They want it done on
the "no cure, no pay" principle, however,
and are not likely to get many offers in
this city. The Pyrenees has to be landed
In San Francisco and then the salvor will
get a "good percentage" of the value of
the wreck. Should the attempt prove a
failure the salvor will have all his trouble
and expense for nothing.

The Joke Is on Captain Polite.
When the American ship Spartan came
in from Newcastle, N. S. W., last week
Captain Polite had to pay pilotage. When
she was ready to sail for the Sound
Thursday a pilot was ready to take him
out, but the captain got the better of him
by changing the shlp T s record at the Cus
tom-house. When the work was done
Polite remarked to the customs clerk that
he had no cigars with him, but if he
would come down to the Spartan he would
give him a few good Manilas. While un
der his British papers Captain Polite's
cigarsâ there were 2000 of themâ were not
subject to duty, they being intended for
his own use. Directly he changed the rec
ord to escape pilotage, however, the Ma
nilas became subject to 60 per cent ad
valorem. The clerk who made the change
remarked to somebody in the Surveyor's
office that he was going to get some good
cigars off the Spartan. The good news
was told to others, and finally Deputy
Surveyor St. John heard of it. A few min
utes later a customs inspector was on his
way to the Spartan, and when Captain
Polite got there his cigars were on their
way to the Appraiser's store. For a few
minutes the joke was on the pilot, but
now that the cigars are gone Captain
Polite cannot see where the laugh
comes In.
Five hundred and fifty smuggled cigars
were seized yesterday in the carpenter
shop on board the steamer Columbia by
customs officials. Four hundred and fifty
cigars were obtained in the Spartan seiz
ure.
shy of the Alcatraz anchorage. Four of
them have lost anchors and chain there
during the last ten days, and perhaps
there will be as many more during the re
mainder of the month. On June 4 the
British ship Cardiganshire nearly went on
Alcatraz because her chain parted. On
June 7 tho barkentlne Newsboy lost her
anchor and chain in the same place and
then drifted down on the bark Martha
Davis. Thursday night the schooner
Rosamond camo in and tried to anchor in
the same place.. Soon after the chain part
ed and slxtv fathoms of it went down to
Join the anchor. Some dny next week
there will be a fleet of tuga off Alcatraz
grappling for lost anchors.
Captain Ward of the Rosamond reports

River for Callao. Her crew asked to be
reported "all well."
AMERICAN SHIP HENRY B. HYDE IN HEAVY WEATHER OFF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, DURING A SUCCES
SION OF FIERCE GALES SHE LOST NEARLY A SUIT OF CANVAS AND HAD HER DECKS SWEPT OF
EVERYTHING MOVABLE.
Defense Asks for Acquittal.
At the afternoon session Attorney Near
lnc opened for the defense and demanded
acquittal. He declared that the State had
adduced nothing to prove their charge
that the Prince family had conspired to
kill Kennedy. The defendant, he said, had
chot him during a condition of hysteria
bordering on insanity, after he had ruined
her and after she had pleaded with him
In vain to live with hÂ«?r. Mrs. Kennedy
sobbed audibly during Attorney hearing's
appeal.
Charles E. Burnham. assistant prosecut
ing attorney, followed for the State, de
crying the plea of insanity. He declared
that after the Princes had. at the point
of revolvers, tried to force monev from
Kennedy they hatched and helped Mr?.
Kennedy to carry out the murder that she
fir ally committed.
H. B. Kimbrell. also for the State, spoke
next. He told of Kennedy havine been
forced to marry the girl and then having
been shot down because he dared ask the
courts examine into his case.
"They knew.", said he, "that the out
rage that had been perpetrated would be
laid bare. They did not propose to let
Phil Kennedy go into court and tell his
story."
At this point Mrs. Kennedy, who had
been laying her head on the table,
straightened up and shrieked: "Oh,
mercy, man, oh, mercy!" The prisoner
leaned her head upon her father's shoul
der, her face contracted in pain.
KAICSAS CITY. June 14.â The argu
ments in the case of Mrs. Lulu Prince-
Kennedy, on trial" for the murder of her
husband, were concluded to-night and the
jury retired to deliberate upon a verdict.
The jurors bad not been able to agTee
up to 11 o'clock, and the court ordered
them locked up for the night.
When asked how she felt Mrs. Kennedy
Bald: "They gave me some kind of a pow
der a little while ago. I am going to be
brave as possible."
On the opposite side of the aisle from
the Prince family were grouped Captain
Thomas Kennedy, a pioneer citizen of
Kansas City, his young daughter. Thom
as Kennedy Jr., brother of the dead man,
and his wife. With the exception of the
first day of the trial, when the mother
and brother 1 of Philip Kennedy appeared
as witnesses, none of Kennedy's imme
diate relatives have be>en In the court
room before to-day. The dead man's
mother has been too ill to be present.
The day's session was opened by Prose
cutor Hadley reading the instructions to
the jury- The prosecutor read with al
most dramatic tffect and the jury paid
unusual attention.
When Mrs. Kennedy entered the court
room she appeared in better health and
epirits than on any day since the case
opened. She had dressed carefully for
the occasion and anv traces of a break
down that she displayed yesterday had
disappeared.
[ Prisoner Appears Unconcerned.
Every inch of Epace in the courtroom
was taken by spectators. Mrs. Kennedy
paid little attention to the many eyes di
rected toward her. but watched the Jury
Intently, scrutinizing closely the face of
each of the twelve men. Mrs. Kennedy
looked squarely at the prosecutor when
he read that part of the instructions re
ferring to murder in the first degree and
the attendant punishment of death, but
her face did not change expression. When
he came to the instruction for man
slaughter she dropped her head, but only
for a moment.
Frank G. Johnson, former City Police
Judge, then opened the argument for the
State. Johnson traced the killing of Ken
nedy by his -wife of a month, telling how
the had called him from his office' and
Phot liim down without a moment's warn
ing, then coolly submitting to arrest. At
tcrrey Johnson declared emphatically
that the father and brothers of the de
fendant had helped her plan Kennedy's
murder and had stationed themselves
about the scene before it occurred.
"1 say. gentlemen of the jury." conclud
ed he. "there is evidence sufficient to find
tMs defendant guilty of murder In the
lijst decree."
These last words, given in thundering
tones, had no effect upon Mrs. Kennedy
nr.d a moment later, when the court took
a recess until 1 o'clock, she went to her
cell laughing and chatting with the dep
uty who led her.

The electrical decorations are planned
to be particularly fine. Between the larg
er illuminated devices which will be
placed on the newspaper' and other build
ings by private individuals there will be
a serie9 of arches, beneath which will ap
pear the Maltese cross.
The Ferry building will be lighted up
the , same as for . the President's
visit, with the addition of the word "Wei-
come" on the Oakland side. The Call
building and the City Hall, by special re
quest of the Epworth. League officials,
will also appear as during President Mc-
Kinley's visit. Business firms all along
Market street have promised to furnish
â¢appropriate decorations and some of the
largest mercantile houses assure the com
mottees tif displays which will surpass
anything ever before attempted for an
affair of this kind. The finance commit
tee of the convention proposes to expend
about $5000 for. street decoration.
Mechanics' Pavilion and Metropolitan
Hall, together with the churches where
services are to be held, will also be dress
ed in gala attire. What the interior dec
orations will be is undecided as yet, but
it is stated that they will be very elabor
ate. Flowers and native plants will - be
used extensively and banners and bunt
ing will also play a prominent part in the
adornment of the meeting places. .-
It is "expected that in addition to the
decoration fund appropriated by the offi
cials there will also be a large private
subscription. Commercial men are tak
ing hold of the project with .a great deal
of interest and the Â¦ owners of private
houses will be requested to decorate so far
as may be practicable. .
The streets will be trimmed with ever
green and attractive pictorial designs
along Market street from the ferries to
Ninth street and as much outside of these
limits as may be practicable.
The Epworth League officials predict
that the decorations in honor of the in
ternational convention will be far supe
rior to anything ever seen before in San
Francisco. -The Maltese cross, N which is
the emblem of the organization, will play
an important part in all' electrical and
other displays.

representative is in the East negotiating
for the needed machinery. The picture

buildings in the plant.
These structures will be made of steel
and corrugated iron, no wood being em

Attorneys" J. C. Campbell and Thomas
Breece, who represent the petitioner, con
tend that an officer holds over until his
successor is appointed, and such succes
sor, they claim, oould only be appointed
by the Tax Collector. The Civil Service
provisions of the charter not only fall to
vest the commission with power to ap
point deputies in the office In question,
they urge, but were unconstitutional. An
other point raised was that Lewald, hav
ing performed the services set forth in his
petition, was entitled to his salary.
Attorney George D. Lane, on behalf of
the city and county and the Civil Service
Commission, said that the person who was
entitled to the salary of the office in issue
was the person entitled to the office, not
the person who had performed the ser
vices, if such person had been illegally
appointed to office. Mr. Lane also urged
that the Civil Service Commission did
have jurisdiction over the deputies in the
office of the Tax Collector, and, in view
of this condition, that the prayer of the
petitioner should be denied.
Judge Murasky took the case under ad
visement and will give his decision next
week.
Lewald was appointed a deputy by Tax
Collector Scott in April. His demand upon
the treasury was rejected by Treasurer
Brooks, however, at the request of the
Civil Service Commissioners, who claim
the right to appoint the deputies in the
office of the Tax Collector.

arousing public interest in the coming
primaries than all other organizations
combined. The Central Republican Club

within that district. As a general rule.
the Republicans in the majority of As

uhe Democrats of the city are in a mud
cle. Gavin McNab, Mayor Phelan and
Jasper McDonald hold the works. The
County Committee, of which Mr. McDon
ald is the chairman and Mr. McNab the
real boss, seems to possess complete mas
lery of the Democratic neld. There is talk
of a concerted movement to put up a
ticket in each district to oppose the com
mittee's ticket, but no Moses appears to
lead the children of Jefferson. The daily
newspaper organ of the party, at the sug
gestion of Hearst, has attempted several
moves, but Gavin McXab has cleverly
checkmated the non-resident political
manager. Democrats who are in open
revolt ajrainst the organized committee
are waiting for some one of the many dis
prur.tled factions to take the lead in an
arti-PheJan campaign. According to in
side- accounts McNab would not shed real
tpars if the Phelan clique should be
turned out of the party councils, but he
is not seeking a fight in that particular
qurmer. Evidently he fancies that a
waiunpr frame is the best generalship for
the campaign. If Hearst should decide
to put urÂ» a ticket and rally the discon

issue.

Reprimand and Reduc

Â¦?-."" :Punishment.
He Is Saved the Further Dis
grace of Being Placed
on Furlough.
WASHINGTON. June 14.â The loss of
ten numbers in his grade and reduction of
his pay to furlough pay for two years and
to be publicly reprimanded is the sentence
imposed by the court-martial upon Cap
tain Robert E. Impey, at present sta
tioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard.
The captain was charged with scandalous
conduct in having represented to a den
tist that his bill must be reduced because
it required the approval of the treasury
officers, whereas this wAs purely a per
sonal matter. I f
Secretary Long has addressed a letter
to Captain Impey advising him of his
approval of so much of the sen
tence as directed a reprimand and
a reduction in rank, but stating
that the part of the . sentence recom
mending that Captain Impey should be
placed on furlough for two years was re
mitted, "not because of any clemency
which you are regarded as meriting, but
for the reason that the department does
not consider that the interests of the navy
will be advanced by permitting you to
remain in idleness for two years when the
services of all officers are required on ac
tive duty."
In administering the reprimand Included
in the sentence Secretary Long says:
"The offense of which you have been
found guilty is one whjch affects your
honor as an officer, and it is not thought
that anything which the department cay
say in- the nature of a reprimand can add
to the mortification which you should suf
fer by the publication of the general
Jcourt-martial order reciting the charge
and specification and findings and sen
tence- of the court in your case, with the
action thereon." -â¢*-. <
The letter closes with an order that Cap
tain Impey shall be released from arrest
and restored to duty.
ON THE FUTURE
OF NEW AMERICA
Dr. B. F. de Costa Talks
of the Country's Con
ditions.
Says Catholic OHurch Will
Be Potent Factor in Its
Development.
A large audience was present last night
at Metropolitan Temple to hear Dr. Ben
jamin F. de Costa lecture on "America,"
under the auspices of the Catholic Truth
Society. The lecture was highly interest
ing, being an exhaustive study of the
present conditions existing in this coun
try. Dr. de Costa treated of social and re
ligious questions, such as trusts, expan
sion, the negTO problem, the drink evil
and divorce, all of which he held would
be solved by the creation of a new Amer
ica. Dr. de Costa said:
We are able to forecast the futuce of America
by its past. Judging the people of this country
by their origin there need be little fear that
the result will not command the admiration of
the world. There is the possibility of the crea
tion of a new man out of the heterogeneous
mass composing: its population. The American
is not unlike his English brother In the desire
for the acquisition of new lands. Hawaii wa3
seized by this Government without the slightest
authority from God or man, but by the con
nivance of unprincipled adventurers and mis
sionaries' sons. We have taken the Philip
pines â for better or for worse, for richer or
poorer â and we will never get rid of them.
Â¦ The Â¦â¢ unification of America will be accom
plished in various ways. One is by the cessa
tion â¢ of : immigration. That ', will only happen
when the industrial conditions in Europe are
such that they will keep the natives home."
Then only will overcrowding cease here. "We
spend $10 in drink to $1 for education. We can
not afford to continue spending $1, 000. 000, COO for
strong drink. Other evils that must be com
bated are monopolies, trusts, legislatures sold
for cold cash, strikes, mob law, the labor re
former denying a man the right to work when
he finds work at satisfactory, wages, and finally
divorces. â¢ Â« â¢
The situation is not hopeless, but we are rap--
Idly hastening toward the danger point.- I be
lieve that' the constitutional and political ma
chinery will stand the strain at the crucial
point, and that a splendid future awaits the
people of America. Who will save the nation
at the danger point? I answer, a divine power,
the Christian education. of the people, -and de
velopment of their agricultural resources. "We
are offered the opportunity of opening up men
tal, moral and physical riches and we will fall
if we undervalue the situation. The Catholic
church will spread its Influence in the creation
of a new era In America by helping: to create
good citizens, a mighty and much needed factor
in the upbuilding of a great nation.

Excitement Over the Murder of
Planter Edwards Is Almost
Wholly Allayed.
SHREVEPORT, La.. June 14.â The fu
neral of John Gray Foster, the young
planter who was killed on his plantation
by Prince Edwards, a negro, on Wednes
day last, occurred this afternoon and was
largely attended. ' A majority of the busi
ness houses of Shreveport were closed, in
order that their employes might attend
the funeral. Among those present were
Governor McMillin of Tennessee and Mrs.
McMillin, a sister of the murdered man.
The score of negroes under j arrest
charged with complicity in the mifrder of
Foster have been successfully removed to
the Parish Jail at Benton and there is no
further fear of mob violence. Edwards,
who did the killing. Is still at large, and
posses continue in the field, scouring the
country in every direction. If caught Ed
wards will be summarily dealt with. The
excitement of yesterday and last night has
been almost wholly allayed and so far as
the 'negroes now under arrest are con
cerned no further trouble is anticipated.

Â¦ SKATTLE, June 14â The Yukon is open
from end to end, according .to news
brought down by the steamship Dolphin,
which arrived this morning. The ship
brought down $40,000 in gold dust The
presence of $2,500,000 of gold dust In the
banks at Dawson has caused a renewal of
speculation as to what the total output
of the Klondike will be this year. Com
parisons have been made with the receipts
in previous years to the corresponding
date and calculations made. It is held by
many that one-half of the total output is
now in the banks and they figure that
the grand total will oe in the neighbor
hood of $15,000,000. Many persons, how
ever, are ready to place the amount at a
greater figure, and these hold that be
tween $20,000,000 and $25,000,000 would be
nearer the correct estimate.

"My two sisters Â¦were badly troubled
with stomach disorder, but after leaving
off coffee and taking Postum they both
recovered their appetites and took on
considerable flesh. I wish every one could
be Induced to use the health-giving, aro-
matic Postum."
"Morning after morning I gave him
Postum without telling him that It was
any different from ordinary coffee. His
stomach quickly recovered and he began
to eat breakfast He asked me one
morning, as he asked for a second cup
of the Po6tum. 'What witch had taught
me to make such delicious coffee,* and
wher*Â» I 'found some that would agree
with himr Then I told him for the first
time that hÂ« had not been drinking coffee,
but Postum, which had so strengthened
his utomarh that he could now eat as
much breakfast as any one.
A little woman In Butte, Montana, Mrs.
Fitzmaurice, writes that she and her hus-
band are a different kind of people. They
knew enough to quit coffee when It had
rapped them hard. She says: "My hus-
band was so badly affected that he ate
no breakfast for three or four years. He
would often try to drink a few sips of
coffeÂ« and Invariably threw It up. When
Postum Food Coffee was brought to my
attention I tried It without having any
faith In It, but when I found what a de-
JScious beverage It was when prepared ac-
cording to directions, and from trying It
on myself found there were no bad ef-
fects, I induced husband to take a
cup without telling him It was the. Food
Coffee. He objected at first, saying that
he would be sure to throw It up, but when
I Insisted upon his trying It, It agreed
with him.
When a ma.n, from coffee drinking, gets
to such a condition that he cannot eat
breakfast without throwing It up It seems
time to quit, but there are thousands of
Â¦weak-minded people who have not logical
brains enough to understand that when
en article of food or drink produces such
conditions as these It should be abso-
lutely left off.

TCtTW TORK, June 14.â An overwhelming pro
portion cf the day's dealings were In Union
Pacific and St. Paul, and the scrutiny of the
day's transactions will reveal that the strength
in the market was largely confined to the same
stocks. The Influence of that strength on the
general list was considerable during the early
part of, the day, but it steadily waned. There
were some other isolated upward movements,
but these also had little effect upon the gen
eral list. But while prices in general refused
tn respond In sympathy with the points of
rtrength. they were not conspicuously affected
by the heavy realizing that went on all day
under cover of the strength In the two mar
ket leaders. In fact. It was not until Union
Pacific itself relapsed in the last hour of trad
ing that the selling made any notable impres
nlon on prices. At that time there were 6harp
breaks all around which carried the average
level of prices below last night and the sub
Â«-quent rallies were insignificant, the market
closing heavy under renewed selling. All of
the professional elements In the market
neemed to Join In the speculative movement in
Ht. Paul and Union Pacific Authentic offl
rtal statements regarding the many rumors
I>revalent of closer relations between these
properties were conspicuously lacking, but they
fouutl credence as the tape, according to the
methods of corroboratlon used by speculators,
K*ve proof of the rumors. The specific as
sertion that Union Pacific had purchased 250.000
Fhares of St. Paul from long-standing insiders
trail stoutly denied by St. Paul interests, while
t'nion Pacific Interest* refused a confirmation.
Whatex-er may be the origin of the report, or
the nature of the buying of the two Flocks, it
is very clear that they were made use of to
cover large speculative profit-taking in other
parts of the list. The extreme rise in St. Paul
reachwl 6% and In Union Pacific 1%. Colorado
Fuel made another sensational advance of 11
points with a relapse of ZM and Tennessee Coal
rote 4%. apparently in eympathy. Rumors con
tlsue that these companies are to be taken in

Dried Fruits in New York.
The London Grocers' Gazette of June 1
stntes that apricots have been more freely In
quired for In Liverpool, where an advance of
about 9d per dozen has been established. At
the tax of 7s per cwt. it means an advance in
the cost of apricots and green gages of Is 6d
per dozen, and. as nearly as possible, 7s per
case on Continental pulp and 4s 6s on Califor
nia pulp. There is a large, good inquiry for
pears and peaches. In both London and Liv
erpool there is an improved Inquiry for eal
mon.
English duty on fruits preserved in syrup
is as follows: Apricots, plums, green gages,
whole apricots and apricot pulp 7s per cwt.;
pears, peaches and pines. Is per cwt. The
duty is to be charged on the net weight of the
fruit In the tins and bottles. As a result ap- (
ricots are advancing in price, and if this con-i
tinues the consumption is likely to decrease,
with a resulting heavier movement in pears
and peaches. Green sages, whole apricots and
pulp are also advancing In price.

by the United States Steel Corporation. To
day's rumor made the rate of exchange with
Colorado Fuel 100, shares each of United States
Steel common and preferred for every 100
shares of Colorado Fuel. The movement in
Glucose was based on assertions that the ab
sorption of National Starch was near at hand.
The rise In the Readings had no other explana
tion than buying for Philadelphia account, and
in New York Central It was said that the exe
cution of a buying order for several thousand
shares found the supply of stock very scarce.
The advance of 2% In People's Gas was un
explained. The stock fell sharply in the re
action, but saved a net gain of a point. Amal
gamated Copper was feverish, rallying sharply
on the refusal of an injunction against the
purchase of other companies, but going off
again on the further announcement of a stay
pending an appeal to a higher court Mexican
Central, Mexican National and Louisville and
Nashville showed comparative firmness, al
theugh they were affected. The jump in the
call loan rate to 4% per cent late in the day
and the unexpected announcement of an en
gagement of $500,000 in. gold for shipment to
Germany, which, however, It subsequently ap
peared. Is not to go out to-morrow, were in
fluences In the selling movement and carried
suggestions of some such disagreeable surprise
in to-morrow's bank statement as that in last
Saturday's statement. Syndicate operations in
cident to the steel company's transactions in
Philadelphia, the continuance of payments on
subscriptions to Pennsylvania new stock and
preparations for next 'week's Standard Oil divi
dend payment may each, or all, have made
encroachment on banking reserves.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been six arrivals of coal from.
Washington, 15,602 tons; two from Oregon, 1040
tons; three from British Columbia, 11,553 tons,
one from Australia, 2205 tons; one from Balti
more, 3655 tons; total. 34.C64 tons'. The deliv
eries coming to hand this week are ample for
all Immediate demands, yet little, if any, will
go Into yard, as arrivals lately have been very
sparse. Every one in the trade is surprised
at the quantity of coal being shipped here,
still ' it has all found an outlet. Most of our
largest consumers have modified their machin
ery to enable them to utilize oil as a fuel sub
stitution for coal, yet It is barely perceptible
that there is any diminution in the coal out
put. It may safely be estimated that 750,000
tons of coal will be displaced this year by the
fuel Â¦ oil production In California, and this
amount will be Increased to one million tons in
1902, provided low oil values prevail. In mak
ing these figures I am presuming that our
present labor troubles will not last much long
er. " At the same time our colliery proprietors
in Washington and British Columbia are find
ing sale for their entire output, which is un
questioned evidence that the fuel demand for
steam energy mainly is Increasing Immensely.
Prices remain unchanged; oil Is a check to any
advance on coal, hence Its advent into tbia
market has been - a great boon to the manu
facturer."

Piglron production on June 1 was at the
rate of 314,505 tons weekly, according to sta
tistics compiled by the Iron Age. This is
about the anticipated increase for May and
establishes a new high-water mark. An In
teresting feature of the situation is the de
crease of furnaces on blast to 252, which is 41
less thaji were actively employed February 1,
1900, when the weekly output was 298,014 tons.
Although new orders for piglron have been
light In recent weeks. . actual .deliveries on old
contracts must have reached I a heavy total,
for furnace stocks June 1 were but 407,273
tons, a decrease of , 30,565 tons during May.
Conditions in this industry must be satisfac
tory if material Is taken faster than It can
be produced, notwithstanding . a new record
of output for the month. Prices are easier,
Bessemer pig showing a loss compared
with the quotation in February - . last
year, when the production was near pres
ent figures. This absence of inflation in prices
is the best symptom in the market and pre
cludes a possibility of a oollapse like last
year. In finished products there Is great ac
tivity owing to the large amount of Â¦ goods
to be delivered July 1. There Is noted espe
cially urgency for immediate shipment by con
sumers of plates, bars and structural shapes,
the activity in building operations showing
no diminution. . ' '
Seasonal weather has somewhat aroused the
dry goods markets. Forwardlngs of footwear
from Boston have averaged over 100,000 cases
weekly for some time and shops are well en
gaged. Prices arc steady. Scarcity of heavy
sole leather sustains prices, but light weights
are in full stock and well sustained.
Wheat .declined to a more reasonable level
with withdrawal of speculative support. The
Government report of conditions on June 1
was chiefly responsible. Exports of the At
lantic for the week, flour Included, were. 2,
935 983 bushels, as against 4,520,144 bushels in
the previous week and 3,081,926 bushels the
same week last year. _
Failures for the week numbered 179 Iff the
United States against 162 last year and 23 in
Canada against 21 last year.
New York Grain and Produce.
NEW YORK, June 14.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will eay:
Confirmation by the Agricultural Bureau of
recent private estimates of the wheat crop
has given to business a tone of ' greater con
fidence. Retail operations, both East and
West, are larger and distribution of mer
chandise by the wholesale trade is increasing
in dry goods and boots and shoes. The labcr
situation is gradually mending, with the ap
preciation of the fact that in some directions
'manufacturers will be glad of a temporary
shut down of works.
From July 1 to date this season wheat ex
ports ere 203,623,383 bushels, against 191,834,956
bushels last season, and 219,446,758 bushels in
1898-99.
Failures for the week in the United States
number 188, against 163 last week, and 180 in
this week a year ago, 150 in 1899, 207 In 1898
and 226 in 1897.
Canadian failures for the week number 17,
against 24 last week, 23 in this week a year
ago, 25 in 1S99 and 19 In 1898.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4,791,107 bushels, against 6.G44,
644 last week, 4.678,029 in the corresponding
week of 1800, 2,799,971 in 1S39 and 4,396,787 in
1S9S.
Efforts of heavy leather manufacturers to
secure advances on these goods have driven
some of the trade to lighter markets which are
more active. All Western markets report heavy
sole leather firm and tending upward. Hides
are strong and the margin between the raw
and unfinished product Is a narrow one.
Shoe shipments from Eastern markets for the
week have again passed the 100,000 case mark,
despite the . fact that the factories are about
through with their work on summer orders.
For the season shipments are now 118,000 cases
ahead of last year.
Machinery manufacturers are cautious as to
contracting ahead In view of stock uncertain
ties.
The feature in iron and steel is the enlarged
demand for Bessemer pig Iron at Pittsburg for
July and . August delivery, with reports that
the ' largest Interest, the United States Steel
Corporation, is buying heavily in the open
market. In finished lines the feature Is .the
enlarged inquiry and demand for bars and
plates at Chicago and the advance of $2 per
ton noted In the latter. After a long absence
agricultural implement manufacturers are in
the market for some good-sized lots. Wire and
wire goods are in heavy demand and deliveries
are behind hand.
Reports to Bradstreet's show a further_ im
provement In the volume and tone of distribu
tive trade, which had its ' inception in the bet
ter weather and crop conditions. Following
the check given to the crop damage enthusiasts
by the June crop report, which can hardly be
regarded as other than brilliant for wheat,
comes assurances that the conditions of June
1, good as they undoubtedly were, have been
further improved. . What is true of the smaller
cereals is also largely the case as to corn,
though the latter Us backward and needs
warmth. A better business Is noted In some
lines of men's wear woolens and some makes
of cheaper goods are reported heavily ordered
ahead. While the cereals are lower on good
crop reports, quick support has come from the
export demand, which has been the largest for
weeks, past, and the decline has been temporar
ily, at least, arrested. One of the most satis
factory features of Â¦ all is, that after | quite a
period of dullness pig iron has been taken* more
freely at leading markets and bars and plate
have sold better/ the latter even noting an ad
vance. Pig iron production is shown to be pro
ceeding at an â¢, unprecedented rate, but con
sumption appears to wait promptly upon out
put. Railroad earnings continue In diminished
volume end the only decidedly unfavorable fea
ture deserving attention Is the failure of the
machinists' strike to be amicably adjusted, the
prospect being in fact that the. contest will
be a long drawn out one.
NEW YORK, June 14.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Â¦
Bank of England rate reduced to 3 per cent. Â¦
Shipment of $86,496 to China..
Exdiange and Silver show no change.
Wheat and Barley quiet and easy.
Oats, Corn and Rye very dull and unchanged.
Hay weakening again, under larger receipts'
Nothing new in Beans and Seeds.
Potatoes lower under larger stocks. Onions and Vegetables"un
changed.
Butter, Cheese and Eggs as previously quoted. . .
All fresh fruits in good supply. Dried Fruits dull.
No further change in Provisions.
Meat market not yet affected by the strike: \
Business rather better on the local stock exchanges.

Regarding China Signor Prinetti said
nothing remained but to determine the
method of paying ' the Indemnity, i the
amount' of which had been fixed.
Italy, he announced,, would abstain for
the present from any modification of the
tariff, so as not to throw difficulties in
the way of renewing the commercial
treaties with Germany and Austria. He
emphasized Italy's adhesion to the. triple
alliance." Â¦ ' . ,
"Year by' year," he continued, "the

check, while not. adding to Italy's ' mili

has been plainly. manifested' by the dem

NEW YORK, June 11â Wall street's re
cent speculative inactivity received a sud
den impulse to-day when the news leaked
out that important and far-reaching plans
were quietly being worked out in connec
tion with the harmonization of the great
railroad systems of the West. It is au
thoritatively learned that steps . have
been taken by Union Pacific interests to.
acquire a representation in tho board of
directors of the Chicago, Milwaukee and
St.' Paul, and in this way these interests
hope to acquire a voice In the direction
of the latter road's affairs, and It is re
ported that such representation has been
secured. '
This step is in line with the plans made
some months ago, which were interrupt
ed for the time by the quarrel over the
control of the Northern Pacific-
Wall street took it for granted that the
Union Pacific was planning to absorb the
St. Paul in the same manner as the Bur
lington passed under . control of the
Northern Pacific and the Great Northern.
There were explicit denials made on this
point, however, from the best authorities,
who stated that no idea of this nature
was entertained.
The one positive basis for the numerous
reports is the fact that negotiations have
been practically concluded whereby \ a
large block of stock will be transferred to
the financial interests which have been
identified in the past with the Union Pa
cific Railroad. Statements concerning the
sale of a block of stock amounting to

Ee Is Said to Have Been Very Un-
FINANCIAL LOSSES CAUSE
SUICIDE OF SURGEON DALY
fortunate in Several Large
Speculations.
BALTIMORE. Jure 14.â Heavy financial
losses incurred in speculation. It Is assert
ed, caused the suicide In Pittsburg of /Jr.
William Hudson Daly, formerly surgeon
la the United States army, personal friend
<jf General Miles and author of the "em
balmed beef" charges. It was given out
that the suicide was the result of melan
cholia, brought on by the death of h(s
wife. From the most reliable sources It
is learned, however, that the unfortunate
man had invested largely in local securi
ties a.nd lost heavily. Dr. Daly's losses
are paid to have- reached $75,000. A check
drawn by Dr. Daly for a large sum, datt><!
the day preceding his death, has been re
ceived by one of the local trust companies,
and is supposed to represent a portion of
these losses. Â«
The volumes that have disappeared' are
from every department of the library, but
the majority are from the fiction alcoves.
A surprising number also are theological
works. Nothing will be done' toward re
claiming them at present; though definite
restrictions will be piaced on the use of
the library in the near future. The new
library building soon to be built on the
campus will be designed especially! to
guard the majority of the books. Only a
few thousand reference books will be open
for. general access. The rest will be be
hind rails. This will render the consulta
tion of books much more troublesome, but
the action is deemed necessary to save
the library from future losses.
- "Our university library is one of the
few In the country to-day that throws
open the shelves free to every one," said
Librarian Rowell. "This privilege has
been sadly abused in the past and we are
forced to take measures to. Â£top the losses
we have sustained. The next university
librarv will be constructed and conducted
on a different plan. We have been mak
ing our rules more stringent everr year,
but the books havÂ« disappeared Just as in
the past. Nothing but gates can guard
them. Quite 200 books are reported miss
ing again this year. I Asllke to call it
stealing, but it is certainly tad negligence
on the part of students, and 'faculty. I
say 'faculty,' for I have found that some
of our lost volumes have strayed to the
shelves of the professors. One instructor
who had two books which we had been
unable to account for said that- he was
entirely ignorant of any rules governing
the taking out of books. He had. seen
the volumes, taken them down from the*
shelves, made no mention- of the matter
at the desk and had kept them so. Ion?
at his home that he actually forgot they
had ever been university property. ' -.
"It is mostly carelessness. There is lit
tle real thievery. But I see no way to
stop this neglect except by restricting the
privileges of both professor and student."
BERKELEY, June 14.â Over 200 valua
ble books are reported missing from the
University of California library. In spite
of the repeated agitation against book
stealing, with stricter library rules and a
more determined effort on the part of the
student body to root out the evil. Librar
ian Joseph C. Rowell declares, after
checking up his catalogues this year, that
the question is as far from settlement as
ever. Quite as many books have been lost
this year as last. Some of them may be
returned by their tardy borrowers, but
the great majority are gone no one knows
where.

CREATES A STIR
OAKLAND. June 14.â Jacob A. Jc
hansen, a repairer in the block
system department of the South
ern Pacific Company, was killed
this afternoon by being "crushed
under the racetrack special train as it
was being backed down*" the Oakland
mole to the broad-gauge depot for its first
trip to Emeryville.
The accident was witnessed by Ford
Marcellus, another repair man, and by
Conductor F. Graves and the brakeman
of the train. The latter were standing on
the rear platform of the coach, which
Etruck Johansen. who only a minute be-
fore had been working on a switch box
opposite the point where he was killed.
The reports furnished to the Coroner by
the witnesses tended to show that Johan
sen had seen the train moving down the
track and had Intended to step out of the
way. Instead ho walked directly Into the
train and before a warning signal could
be Riven was knocked down and run over.
Two cars passed over the unfortunate
workman's body before the train could be
brought to a standstill. Â¦*
Quickly the body was taken out from
beneath the cars, but the rescuers saw
nt once that the crushed form was life
less. The head had been almost severed
from the body by tho grinding weight of
the heavy carwheels. i
The Coroner was notified and the re
mains were conveyed to the Morgue.
The accident occurred just west of a
Fv/itch connection between the semaphore
bridge and tower No. 2. The racetrack
train had been backed down along the
track nearest to the mole driveway. Tho
cars were thrown over to tt)e switch
Crossing to- bÂ« backed into the main de
pct to receive the racetrack travelers

back 100 feet from the switch when Jo
hansen was struck just where he had
Leen busy on a switch box. -
The accident was peculiarly distressing
in that a wife and, six children survive
the deceased, who was 50 years old and a
.native of Norway. He resided at 1779 Wil

ADYEKTISTS SELECT
CONFEBE2JCE LEADERS
BOSTON*. June .14.â Before the Young
iien s Christian Association convention
to-day Dr. Winfleld S. Hall of Chicago
created quite a sensation by asserting
that our ancestors were apes. The meet
ing was on the physical work of the as
sociation, most of the delegates being di
:ccors of association gymnasiums
throughout the country. Being good
Â«-<i iri^ c ' nSt they could not accept the Oar
wia theory.
i-iÂ°n e Â», deiegate der Â»anded to know of Dr.
U<lU how it was possible for God to make
an ape with a soul, or develop man from
u soulless ape. Dr. Iiall said that any
oiseussion or racial development must be
based on the evolution theory. This the
ory, he said, was now accepted as a
working basis by every biologist and so
ciologist of repute.
"The progenitors of man were probably
not very unlike the anthropoid apes of
Asia aad Africa," he said. "It is believed
by biologists that the human race de
scended irom the anthropoid ape as we
know him. but that primeval man and
tne modern anthropoid ape had a com
mon progenitor, now extinct. This is the
real snissingr link which biologists have
bÂ«-n looking for."
A very animated discussion followed the
but Dr. Hall proved equal to the
occasion and took the stand that it was
possible for a student of evolution to be
even a greater Christian; that the
* hristian evolutionist's idea of God was
not antagonistic to Christianity*
Her. Dr. PJumb. who presided, arose to
ask a cuestion. which -was:
"Then, according to your logic, the
clock in the Strasburg Cathedral was
once a Waterbury watch; it grew larger
as a watch until it became a small clock,
and then, it became a great cathedral
clock."
Dr. Hall thought Rev. Dr. Plumb's
question answered itself, and tho inci
dent was ended.
Many delegates were given a reception
by the Young Men's Christian Association
of Harvard University in Phillips Brook's
house. Cambridge, to-night. Representa
tives of Germany, Holland, Japan, India.
Switzerland. England, Norway, France
aid Denmark made short addresses.
Thf> evening meeting in Mechanics' Hall
was termed "college night," and the chief
incident was the reading of a message of
congratulation and friendship from King
Edward VIL It was greeted with cheer
ing and the singing of "God Save the
Kinsr" by the audience. Field Marshal
I-ord. Roberts also seat a message
praising the vrork of the association in
thÂ« army.
The speakers included President P.itton

OAKLAND, June 14.-^The Stablemnn's
Union will order the hostlers to quit work
to-morrow morning in all stables whose
proprietors refuse to sign the agreement
to pay not less than $2 per day wages and
to employ only, union men. ....
The union received to-day the following
communication from the employing liv
erymen:
"At a" meeting held by the proprietors
of the Oakland livery -stables on June 13
resolutions were adopted as follows, viz. :
' "We are willing to recognize union
wages and pay men United States coin
monthly or weekly, as desired, < the men
to sleep and board where they desire." ;
The union will not take congnlzance of
this pffer, because the bosses do not sign
the union aereement. , '. r
This afternoon . the Thirteenth-street
stables, the Nevada stables and the Thir
teenth-avenue stables acceded to the de
mands of the men. The officers of the
union are, confident that practically all
tho employers will sign .rather than risk
a strike. . â¢ * r? _

"Union Agreement to Be Presented
1 HOSTLERS MAY QUIT WORK.
The wholesalers, maintain confidence
that they .will win. They assert their abil
ity to supply their, customers with all the
meat required. \ -The fight here now hinges
on the result in San Francisco.
Concerning the * statement of Attorney
Frohman of- the wholesalers, there Is only one
true ut*rance in it. ! That la that the ' strike
was caused on account of the union cards.
All the retailers had agreed ' to our demands
and to those who desired union cards the cards
were issued. Then the wholesale butchers
went to work, anil by. threatening the with
drawal of trade relations tried to force down
what cards were up. At that time ,ln 93
shops' out of 115 shops in Oakland, Alameda
and Berkeley, the card was up. To save these
95. cards prompt action was necessary and It
was then and only then that we demanded a
union card in every- shop.,
This morning four union shops were
running in Oakland and one in Berkeley.
All of them had beef from outside the
stockyards. About 100 head of'cattle have
been received by the union retailers from
the interior.. Two slaughter houses are
being run by- union, journeymen, they
claim, the location being closely guarded.
W. G. Miller, Mohr & Mllnthrop, Mun
son' & Lohry and Breiling Bros, have been
unionized, the strikers returning to work
at each shoo. /
The- press committee of the local union
says: . - ', Â¦â¢'. Â¦ . â¢ /
The union has, unionized several shops
during the day and claims there will be
at least twenty open to-morrow displaying
the*unlon*sign. â¢ -.
There was a disturbance at Fred Beck
er's lower Washington-street market this
morning when a crowd gathered hooting
and jeering at the driver of Miller & Lux's
delivery team that had brought a load of
beef from San Francisco. Some bad eggs
were thrown, but the trouble was soon
over.
"I am out of the board," he declared,
"and I am with the union, and if you go
down I'll go down with you." '.' [
The union held a long session to-day,
during which Chris Merchant, an employ
ing butcher at 25 Sixth street, San Fran
cisco, made a speech, declaring that the
fight between the Butchers'- Board of
Trade and the Western Meat Company
was at an" end and that during the strike
the latter had been delivering beef to
known members of 'the board Â¦; of trade
against which the!- Western Meat-Com
pany had ' been battling "for ' nearly ; ten
years. '
Merchant announced that he had union
ized his shop. , . .
The union butcher workmen of Oakland
have centered their efforts upon securing
supplies for the proprietors of shops that
display the union card.

STIiVANIA,'Ga., June 14.âThe hanging
of five men upon the same gallows at the
same moment here today marked the end
of .what is thought to have been an.' organ
ized . gang, of murderers. -.The men exe-.
cuted were Arnold Augustus, 1 Andrew". Da
vis, Richard Sanders, "William Hudson and
Samuel Baldwin, all negroes. The victims
of - their crime, were Constable Mears and
Filmore Herringtoh, whom they ambushed
and shot - to death, â¢ and - Captain -Wade,
whom they Â¦' seriously Iwounded. . On at
least two "occasions'efforts-were made "to
lynch the murderers," but by the prompt
action of the officers of the law they were
frustrated. On one of these occasions the
Governor found It necessary to order out
three companies of the State militia, /' "
The 'â execution to-day was strongly
guarded by local militia, because of a ru
mor that an effort would be-made by ne
groes to Â¦ effect the rescue of the con
demned. But there was no disturbance
nor the suggestion of any. The hanging
was in private, the stockade" being â¢Â¦ sur
rounded by: a. strong cordon of troops.^
Five thousand persons gathered in the
village, but only about forty were admit-"
ted to the inclosure. The condemned men
maintained a stoical reserve,. refusing to
confess or to talk about the crime. They
were attended by > ministers of their own
race, who besought them to -ease (their
consciences by making some acknowledg
ment of their sins. Still they refused to
talk. The five, shackled in -chains, were
marched upon the gallows together. When
the trap fell the necks of four were
snapped like reeds. The fifth struggled
for five minutes.and died of strangulation.
The five bodies were cutyiown in a drizzle
of rain. .. V 5 -.. - :
These five negroes were. convicted. of a
murder committed under an alleged crim
inal conspiracy by an organized band of
blacks, known as "Knights of the ..-rqh
er." The motto of the organization was,
It is said, "Death to the Whites." The
murder for which the \ men died was but
the culmination of a long series of crimes.
It is common report that the charter of
the oath-bound organization was signed
in blood, and.the leader, Andrew McKin
ney,: assembled his band only at night,
when he swore them, with awesome rites,
to secrecy and to deeds of death and rob
bery. Â¦Â¦: â¢- â¢" .-, '-Â¦ - -Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦ y.j :
In October, 1899, Milton,Mears, a Con
stable of Schreven County, Fillmore Her
rington and Captain - Jesse ;Wade started
out.from Sylvania to serve a warrant for
the arrest of Joe Sanders, a young negro
wanted for ' some trivial offense. No
sooner had they, reached | his house than
a' fusillade -began." From the cracks be
tween the logs'of the cabin and.from a
thicket of dwarf trees close by came the
flash of Hflcs and shotguns, and the three
men ' f e]JL desperately wounded."- - Captain
"Wade managed to crawl to his buggy and
make his way to Sylvania, where he told
of the shooting. . Herrington and Mears
were literally shot to pieces." The murder
ers escaped, but one. after.:another five
were arrested and placed: in jail here.
These were the.men who were hanged toÂ»
day. ~
The others, including McKlnney and the
real leaders of the Knights of the Archer,
successfully effected their escape and
have never been captured.

Members Decide That Congress Shall
Be Held Every Two Years
in Future.
The California State Floral Society, at
Its regular, monthly meeting yesterday
afternoon, passed a resolution by way of
effort to keep better tab on its finances.
For some time past the absence of the
treasurer, John Henderson, ' . from the
meetings and the. latter' s failure to make
regular ' monthly reports has created dis
satisfaction; Henderson has been treas
urer of the organization for the past
three years. There was , never any Inti
mation that his accounts were in error,
but his methods caused annoyance. .
Â¦ The resolution passed yesterday ' re
Â«uires the treasurer tq make a monthly
report on the condition of the society's
finances.
It was decided to hold a floral congress
every two years and to establish a ques
tion box for the benefit of new members.
Letters, of thanks from Mrs. McKlnley
and Governor Nash of Ohio for flowers
received were read. .

Â¦ Captain Seymour and his men are look
ing for, a clever swindler who 'has been
passing worthless $1 notes on the Bank of
New Brunswick. The notes are signed by
the secretary of the bank, but not by the
president'.-and lack* the date on which they
were issued. . . â¢ .
Captain, Seymour is of the opinion that
the notes were ; stolen from the office of
the firm which was employed to print
them by a gang of Eastern crooks, who
are industriously engaged in circulating
them throughout the country.
A well-dressed young man visited Fo
leys bakery, at Post and Devisadero
streets, yesterday; and after purchasing
some cakes tendered one of the notes In
payment. Thinking it was genuine, the
baker placed it in the. cash register and
handed the swindler the necessary change.
Shortly after he had left Foley carefully
examined the note, and noticing that it
did not bear the name of the president of
the bank he showed it. to a friend who is
engaged in the banking business. The
latter pronounced it 'worthless and ad
vised Foley to notify the police, which he
did. Â¦ '
It is believed that the gang has already
succeeded , in - passing a large number of
these notes throughout the country. To
day the Dresident of the bank of New
Brunswick will be notified by wire of the
existence of the worthless notes and asked
to take steps to intercept the gang which
has been circulating them. . ;

Supervisors' Committee Refers the
Proposed Ordinance Back to Board
Without Recommendation.
The Supervisors' committee on licenses
and orders yesterday referred back to the
t>oard without recommendation the pro
posed ordinance imposing an annual li
cense cf $53 per annum on street cars.
The bill was passed to print after a peti
tion Sled by two members of the Grand
Jury asking that the present license of
$15 per annum be raised. It is not likely
that the ordinance will be finally passed
In the face of the committee making no
/recommendation, and the license will re
main at its present rate. All the street
railway companies filed strong 'protests
against the Increase, and Chairman
Comte admitted that the board's action
in passing the ordinance to print was
hasty.

CHINESE COXSUL GENERAL
. AND MAN WHOM HE WANTS
DEPORTED. 3
a visit to China, was denied a" landing yes
terday, by the Collector of Customs on
the ground that he was a manufacturer
and not a merchant, and that manufac
turers, no matter on how large a scale, do
not belong to the classes of Chinese per
sons who may be admitted to this coun
try. > -:Â¦Â¦..-
It was shown on competent and uncon
tradicted evidence before the bureau that
Ong owned a large clothing salesroom in
this city. and made a specialty of buying
and selling silk goods. He had lived here
for, many years and recently paid a visit
to relatives in China, never doubting that
his return would be barred. But the 'Chi
nese ; Bureau â¢ obtained evidence that a
sewing-machine for the manufacture of
silk clothing for. patrons was operated in
his store, and the bureau decided that to
that extent he was a manufacturer, and
therefore not entitled to be landed
The decision of the Collector was based
upon an opinion rendered by the Solici
tor of -the Treasury Department on Jan
uary 23 of this year In the case of Yip
Toy,- a cigar merchant and manufacturer.
In that case the department ruled that a
merchant who changes . the character of
goods before he sells them Is an. artificer,
or manufacturer, and therefore â¢ not eligi
ble to admission. : .
Lyman.I. Mowry, attorney for Ong Shi,
gave notice that he would file an appeal. I
The printing committee of the Board of
Supervisors was besieged yesterday morn
ing by a small army of printing concern*
and other bidders to do the city's print
ing and furnish the stationers* for the
next fiscal year. 'Nearly every firm had
some protest to make against his rival.
One claimed that certain firms had not
deposited certified checks to the amount
of 10 per cent of the bid. but the commit
tee ruled that sufficient money was up to
cover faithful performance of contract.
The Hayden Printing Company, though
the lowest bidder on certain books, lost
the contract because a rule in the pro
posals provides that no bid shall be re
ceived except from parties regularly en
gaged in the business. For a similar rea
son Brltton & Bey secured the lithograph
ins: contract because the lowest bidders
are not in the lithographing business. The
city may experience some trouble in this
connection, as the charter specifically pro
vides that contracts shall be awarded to
the lowest bidders. All the successful
bidders agreed to have the work done by
union labor cnly.

JUNIOR CLASS TENDERS RECEPTION
TO GRADUATES OF NORMAL SCHOOL
TONG K. CHOXG, editor of the
World, the Chinese organ in this
city of the adherents of Emperor
Kwang Hsu, filed a petition in the
United States LMstrict Court yes
terday for the release on habeas corpus of
Su Shih Chin, who was arrested at the In
stigation of Minister Wu Ting Fang for
being unlawfully in this country.
The document was prepared by Samuel
M. Shortridge and George A. McGowan,
attorneys for the San Francisco wing of
the reform party. It alleges that Su is
being held a prisoner by Customs Col
lector Stratton without authority of law
and under no legal process whatever, no
complaint having been filed or warrant
issued from the date of his arrest until
, the filing of the petition for the writ/ of
habeas corpus.
Lawyers in the Federal building are of
the opinion that Judee de Haven will re
lease CbirÂ« at 10 o'clock this morning, the
time set for the hearing. Anticipating
such action on the part of Judge de
Haven, the Chinese Bureau yesterday
afternoon filed a complaint charging Su
with being unlawfully in the country. A
warrant will be Issued upon the complaint
this morning by United States Court Com
missioner Heacock, and should Su be re
leased on habeas corpus the warrant will
be served at once.
This will hold the prisoner until the de
cision of the Secretary of the Treasury
shall have been received. But lawyers

President Gustave Brenner acted 'as
master of ceremonies. He* opened the
proceedings with a . short Introductory
speech and then called upon E. T. Wolfe.
He was followed by "Wallace "Wise, "who
spoke of the "Bulk, law" and the efforts
of legislators to secure its enactment.: J.
J. Schutz spoke of thet,beneflts which a
membership in the association of credit
men- brought to the merchants.
For a time all thoughts of the cares of
business were dropped, and the members
entered. Into the discussion of the good
things spread before them with all possi*

Attorney Mayer will present affidavits
tills morning, upon which Judge Kerrigan
will issue a citation directing Ross to ap
pear and show cause why he should not
be punished for contempt. This done. At
torney Mayer will proceed until Ross has
either purged himself of contempt or has
demonstrated his inability to do so.
"An attorney has just entered." said
Judge Kerrigan, "MB whose ability and
judgment I have full confidenceâ Attorney
Mayer. I will appoint him to act as a
friend cf the court in this matter, and
after investigating the conduct of Mr.
Ross to proceed against him as the cir
cumstances may warrant. I aip uncer
tain as to whether the acts committed by
Mr. Ross constitute a contempt of this
court or are sufficient grounds for his dis
barment, but -hese are matters which I
â¢will leave in the hands of Mr. Mayer."
Attorney O. C. Pratt, who represented
Mrs. Kcllman in the divorce proceedings,
instituted by Kollman. then made his po
sition in the cast at bar clear. Mr. Pratt
stated that as bis client had grounds for
divorce he had found it necessary, inas
much as his client was anxious for a di
vorce and her husband's prayer for a di
vorce had been practically denied, to file
a cross-complaint, to which Kollman's de
fault had been f ntered. He was only pro
ceeding. Mr. Pratt explained to the court,
within the 'fixed rules of law. and had
only resorted to proceedings in contempt
when all other efforts to secure for his
client 1 sufficient funds to prosecute her
cross-conplaint failed. Judge Kerrigan
stated that of his own knowledge Mr.
Pratt's position in the case was clear of
all en.tanglemerts and was just and
proper.
Continuing:. Mr. Pratt stated that
though the conduct of Attorney Ross was
not la keeping with the dignity of the
profession, as opposing counsel he did not
feel that it would be dignified upon his
part to move against Ross. Judge Ker
rig-an stated that this view met with the
approval of the court. At this juncture
Attorney Mayer entered the court.
Yesterday afternoon Kcllman. appeared
before Judge Kerrigan to show cause
why he chculd not be punished for con
tempt of court for having failed to pay
costs as contained in an order Issued by
the court. It was necessary for Kollman
to produce his proofs that he was unable
to comply with the order of court. This
fact was within the knowledge of the
court, and Judge Kerrigan stated that in
view of Kolimans inability to comply
with the order he would purse him of
contempt.
M Â¦ ~ -
James X- Ross, attorney at law, failed
to appear before Judpe Kerrigan yester
day ::nd explain how he came to give his
client. Thomas F. KoHman, an alleged
copy of a decree of divorce, under the pro
visions of which Kollman believed he was
a "widower." Af a result of the absence
of Rcss. Judge Kerrigran appointed Attor
ney Joseph H. Mayer to serve as the
friend of the court to investigate Ross'
misconduct and proceed against him as
developments demanded.
