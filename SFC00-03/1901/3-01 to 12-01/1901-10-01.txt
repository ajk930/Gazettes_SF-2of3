NEW YORK, October 1, J901,
Office of the President.
Harriman's official announcement,
which was distributed from "the office of
Vice President Kruttschnitt, reads:
SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMPANY.
AS exclusively announced in
last Sunday's ' Call, "E. H.
Harriman is now president of
the Southern Pacific Company. , The
official circular, signed by Harriman,
was issued yesterday, and in it the
new railroad f. president 7 states \u25a0 that
Julius Kxuttschnitt is appointed as
bis assistant.
All the prominent officials in . â¢ the
railroad building \u25a0 were notified last
Saturday, that Harriman bad ap
pointed himself president of the road,
but it was not until 4 o'clock yester
day afternoon that the small, white
Blip of paper was handed out officially
notifying the . public that the South
ern Pacific Company had passed an
other landmark in its history. -.
All reports to the effect that H. E.
Huntington / will again '.;. take an active
hand in the affairs of the Southern Pa
cific Company are erroneous. Mr. Hunt
ington arrived from New York yesterday,
accompanied by his mother and sister.
Old -railroad officials pointed significantly
to the fact that Huntington was coming
here -just Â»at the time when Hays was
stepping out and that he might again
take offices in the railroad building and
"preside over the company's local affairs.
The first words of Huntlngton's Interview
to a Call reporter yesterday afternoon
dispelled these rumors, however. He
said:
I have come out here to Inspect my many in
terests in California.- I am not going to take
any active interest in the management of the
road, , as ' I have not the time. My present
duties are very heavy and I have not nor will
I have, in the future any -other connection with
the Southern . Pacific Company than what de
volves'upon me as vice president of the com
' r~i > 1 1 lliiiijjjji" Tnfo rfrniTinnrnn mid that he
-â¢icpeT5Ted~to remain - in \u25a0 California two
months. During that time he would visit
Los Angeles. He explained that vast im
provements were to be made in the elec
tric street car. lines in that City and that
a new .line to San Pedro and a new line
to 'Pasadena, which would include a
branch line to San Gabriel, will be built.

With . the appointment , of Kruttschnitt
as .assistant to President Harriman, all

he. .went with the avowed purpose of en

a> farewell visit to the, railroad building
yesterday, and said good-by ? to those'few
who had been associated with him during

pany. : He leaves shortly for the East.

from Extension, B. C. says fire broke
out at the bottom of the level and' was
communicated â¢ across the stope by one
of the curtains and in, half an hour the
whole stope was on fire. Rescue parties
entered the mine and reached- the place
where the miners had been at work, -but
the men had gone, running with the fresh
air instead of against it, in an attempt to
get out by the accustomed' route, thus
meeting death half way. While the res-,
cuers were at work the mine exploded,
blocking them, and explosions occurred
all the afternoon and evening, i When it
was realized that. the men could not be
saved, a strong force started to choke tho
mine, but their work was undone by a
terrific explosion which, blew down the
barricade. At 5 o'clock the fan house
burned. , . .... ..'\u25a0-'. '.

manager of the Extension mines of that
company, situated near Ladysmith:.
"Fire occurred in No. 2 slope at No. 3

Casualty Lists Demanded.
The general belief prevails at the War
Department that the three officers of the
companyâ Captain T. "W. Conaell.. First
Lieutenant E. A. Bumpas and Surffeprt
Griswold, were killed in the engagemerrtr
The opinion was expressed by many of
ficers on duty in "Washington that hn :
they been In command of a compart rf
which suffered such a terrible _ dlssatc \u25a0-.
they would have preferred death- 1>
undergoing an Investigation. An of
ficer's highest duty Is to his men," and t.
he were criminally negligent and a sur
prise occurred as a result of it. tlv-r.
under the articles of war he may be shot.
Officials of the department are not In
clined to pass judgment upon Captain
Connell's conduct until they are acquain:
ed with all the facts.
Officers Probably Perished.
It will, therefore, be necessary for Gen
eral Chaffee to supply General Hughes
with additional troops. These must come
from Luzon if they can be spared. Quiet
prevails in Luzon, but the presence oT
troops is necessary to keep the natives
under control. The "War Department
understands- that there has been recoui
ly an increase of secret societies in Lu
zon, indicating that the Filipinos are still
seditious. Authorities are not dispose!
to send additional troops from the UnStfJ
States, in view of the general intention to
reduce the military force within the next
year. If more men are needed, however.
President Roosevelt will undoubtedly
send them. There will be no hesitation
about It. â¢ '-*<'\u25a0>%
It was pointed out to-day that up to
this time the military in the Philippines
has done nothing to suppress the insur
rection in Samar. It has only garrisonel
strategic points. The Spaniards never
succeeded In establishing order In the in
terior of the island. When in posseVs-oir
they merely devoted themselves to hold
ing ports. -. .
Pres.dent Roosevelt 13 not disposed to
Interfere in the situation until he knows
all about it.' After the "War Department
received the message announcing the fits
aster, a copy was sent to the Wblt'j
House and laid before the President. Tho
information it contained was insufficient
for the guidance of that official, and Act
ing Secretary of "War Sanger cabled to
General Chaffee commending his purpose
to make a thorough Investigation and di
recting him to not only report the result
of i the inquh-j", but */i furnish tho de
partment with ' a full ' description of the
military situation at Samar.
Adjutant General Corbin is generally
acquainted with conditions in Samar by
reason of a visit he paid to that islan.3.
hut he left General Hughes' command
more than a month ago, and he is con
sequently not familiar with the situation
as it exists to-day. There are betwesrt
2000 and 3000 troops in Samar. These ttIH
be sufficient for action at present, but not
for effecting the pacification of the is
land.
More Troops Axe Needed.
President Is Advised.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
"W., "WASHINGTON, Sept. 30.â As a re
sult of the. disaster suffered by the Amer
ican troops in Samar, stern measures are
to be immediately Inaugurated for the)
pacification of that Island. "While pub
licly confident that the catastrophe will
not rekindle the Insurrection In Luzon,
there Is no doubt that the authorities
have not failed to give consideration to
this possibility. If m there ever was any
doubt as to President Roosevelt's policy
toward the Philippines, the practical an
nihilation of Company C swept it aside.
To callers, Roosevelt has spoken in no
unmistakable terms of his determination
to pursue the policy of his predecessor
and effect the suppression of the rebellion
in the Philippine archipelago. This decla
ration applies to Samar as well as to
other islands. By reason of the necesj'ry
of taking action which will counterbal
ance the reverse suffered near Balangiga.
immediate military operations will be di
rected to the destruction of all rebel
forces In Samar.-

TACOM A, Sept. ,30.â Business men of
Tacoma. Seattle and Portland, are taking
steps to form an organization that will
endeavor to bring as many national con
ventions as possible to the cities of the
Pacific northwest. One of the citios
named has frequently been a candidate
for such gatherings as the National Edu
cational Association, the National Edi
torial Association and large meetings of
religious denominations. On numerous
occasions efforts along this line have
been unsuccessful, because the cities of
the Northwest did .not present a united
front. .

The . signing of the peace protocol by
China is looked upon as the beginning of
a new era of prosperity and of a revival
of business conditions in the Far East. '
China is deemed to have gotten off on
very easy conditions. The long time given
for the payment of the indemnity makes
the pecuniary burden a very light one.
The result, however, is entirely in accord
with Japanese feeling.
The reception of the embassy bearing
an apology for the murder of Sugiyamato
took place yesterday and was in marked
contrast to the similar mission to Ger
many. While the Emperor's reply was
entirely dignified and adequate, there was
in It none of the sternness of s the one
which the German Kaiser used. While,
perhaps, this may be attributed in great
measure to the forms oj politeness, it was
aleo another evidence of the desired
affiliation of the two Oriental govern
ments for protection against Western
encroachments. ...

not only irt the American community but
among the entire Japanese nation. - News
papers and public bodies have been mogt

The health of Marquis Ito has of late
been the cause of much solicitude On the
part of h's friends, who have finally pre
vailed upon him to take a sea voyage, and
he will soon leave for America. As he has
long been the most prominent figure in
Japanese politics, his absence will bring
about a decided change in party move
ments and possibly become the occasion
for an entirely new alignment. As it is
impossible to distinguish any issues
dividing Japanese political parties, how
ever, the formation of a new set is of the
smallest consequence. The Marquis sails
for Seattle by the Kaga Maru on the ISth

President Powers requests an early re
ply as to the attitude of each club on the
matters as presented.. .
It is not the purpose of this letter to criti
cise the action of the National League in this
matter, but simply to acquaint you .with the
fact that In consequence of .the -National
League's abrogation of the national agreement,
which for so many years has ' been considered
the bulwark of professional baseball, the fol
lowing leagues of professional baseball clubs
have banded together for mutual protection and
organized an entirely independent association.
The membership of this new organization is
composed of eleven leagues, representing the
Western League, the Eastern League, the
Western Association, the Indiana-Iowa-Iln

Connecticut State LeagueT-the New England
League, the Southern League, the Virginia-

While it is to be regretted that a baseball
war now exists between the National and
American leagues, . yet the minor leagues are
in no way parties to it or responsible for it.
and as the minor leagues desire to remain neu
tral we respectfully appeal to and rtquest that
the individual members of each of the Ameri
can and National leagues express their willing
ness as Individual clubs to respect the reserves
and contract rights of the minor league clubs
with their players, the minor league' clubs,
members of the National Association of Profes

specting the re&erve and contract rights of the
club members of the National and American
leagues with their players, or such- individual
clubs of their' two leagues as may be willing
to Join with us in this reciprocity arrangement.
I am prompted to make this proposition with
the hope that a sufficient number/ if not all of
the individual club members of the two war
ring National and American leagues will co
operate with the NatlonaJ Association' of Pro
fessional Baseball Leagues on these Important
and essential points.

It is said the Shamrock is to have, a
new mainsail and jib for to-morrow's
race, but no move was made during the
day to change these sails. Some jibs
were hoisted and stretched and some
wire rigging was placed and served. Cap

UNITE AGAINST
SAN FRANCISCO
Major Hawkes produced -a paper con
taining this lisU saying he saw-Heistand
write" the names. Colonel Heistand ,,m T
spected the paper and said he thought it
was his writing, but where or when he
wrote the names he had no recollection.
Members of the committee brought out
the fact that Boyd, Meiklejohn, Allen,
Corbin and. Jackson were not present at
the meeting. Some discussion arose as to
â¢a cablegram from General Otis contained
in a letter. Heistand wrote to Hawkes
regarding a site for a hemp factory in
the Philippines. The committee wanted
to know who sent the cablegram to Gen
eral Otis which called for his reply.
Colone! Heistand- said he sent -it as a
personal message.
The letters which were read to-day were
copies which Hawkes had retained.
Heistand acknowledged most of them,
saying that so far as he could recollect he
had written them. The committee ad
mitted them, subject to changes which the
originals might show. These originals are
in Heistand's possession and he was asked
by the committee to produce them and he
promised to do so.
The investigation will be resumed to
morrow mornins.
At the afternoon session Majjr Hawkes
was sworn and testified to the statements
heretofore made in the Senate - which
caused the investigation. He went into
details and read copies of letters which
Heistand had written to him. The most
important development during the day
was Major Hawkes' testimony regarding
the first meeting : of some of .those who
were projectors 6f< the proposed Manila
Rope Company, which was held in Dud
ley & Michener's law office, in this city
in the summer of 1899. Those present,
besides the attorneys, were Colonel Hei
stand*and W. E. Wharton. In answer to
an inquiry as to who were in the company.
Colonel Heistand wrote the following list
of names: William W. Dudley, Lewis T.
Michener. E. L. Hawkes. James E. Boyd,
George D. Meiklejohn. Charles H. Allen
and H. O. S. Heistand, H. C. Corbin and
Lewis B. Jackson.
In his reply Colonel Heistand says he
was identified with the proposed company
and considered - his connection with It
legitimate and honest. Some time prior
to the making of the charges Colonel Heis
tand says he ceased all negotiations with
Major Hawkes, effecting a settlement in
full with him. Major Hawkes delivered
to him all papers in the case and took a
receipt for tham. Subsequently Colonel
Heistand received a letter from Major
Hawkes, in which the latter said he had
retained certified copies of all the letters
and papers in the case and had photo
graphs of the most important documents.
Among the papers sent by the War De
partment were those relating to the ap
pointment of Major Hawkes to the army
and as an officer in the Philippine cus
toms service and his discharge from that
place.
Formation of Company.
Reply of Heistand.
The committee decided : that the pro
ceedings | should be public, th'at course
being regarded as best for all concerned.
In brief the charges against Colonel
Heistand .are .that -he, Jin connection with
other officers in the army, and some offi
cials in the civil departments of the Gov
ernment, attempted to form a combina
tion to control the output of hemp from
the Philippines, using their official po
sitions and influence to further their
fnds. Major Hawkes preferred the
charges to the Secretary of War iand
also to the Senate Committee on Military
Affairs. They were denied by those
against whom the allegations were made.
Alter some consideration the Senate by
lesolution authorized the investigation.
-At the opening of the . inquiry several
important documents from the War De
partment were submitted to the commit
tee, including a copy of the charges made
against Colonel Heistand and his reply to
them.

WASHINGTON', Sept. Saâ The bright eun
ehlne and fresh air had the effect of bringing
all thÂ« members of the Schley court of inquiry
and the attendants upon the court to the build
ing' rather earlier than usual this raornlng.
Admiral Dewey. as is his custom, was one of
the flm members to put in an appearance,
but ac early as was his arrival he found Judge
Advocate Lemly and his assistant, Hanna,
there 1& advance of himself. The admiral, as
usual, wore only citizen's clothing upon his
arrival, but he was 6oon transformed Into a
gallant tar by donning his service uniform.
Captain I>>xxJy and Hanna -were engaged from
the early morning in preparing the programme
trr TiiÂ» 6zf. There is much in the way of de
tail to be dctÂ«c . each morning, and they have
fallen into the iiabit of coming direct to the
court building, where they have they- list of
witnesses, files of documents and everything
else bearing upon the case. They began the
day's proceedings according to custom by re
calling the -witnesses of previous days.
Captain Lemly'B programme provided that
-theee should be followed by Commander Miller,
who commanded the collier Merrimac in the
early part of the Santiago campaign; Captain
Jewell, who commanded the scout Minneapolis:
Lieutenant Commander Sharp, who had charge
of the much-talked-of Vixen, and LJeutenaht
J. G. Donilee of the Brooklyn. It was also
contemplated to call Rear Admiral Evans, who
wa5 captain of the Iowa. Much interest was
manifested in the probable appearance of the
rear admiral and also In the prospect of see
ing Captain Miller, who, it will be remem
bered, surrendered with great reluctance the
command of the Merrimac to Lieutenant Hob
ton, who afterward sank the collier in the
mouth of Santiago harbor.
While Commander Southerland was on the
etand he was asked by the court whether, if
the fleet of Cervera had been in the harbor at
CiÂ«Â»nfue?os. it could have been seen by the
vessels tlcc'sading the port. He replied:
"I car.not definitely say. Not unless they
had anchored in the lower harbor. Just biElde
of the er.trance in the deep water where the
echooner M which I referred before was an
chored. iÂ» not believe they would have an

Tne fir^ Â»w witness of the day was Com

of the c : *er Merrimac while that vessel -<ras

fctterwtrd he had trouble with his machinery,
so that by May 23 and 24 he would have hesi

t-even knots. He read from the collier's log to
the (, that the Iowa, the Massachusetts and the
\u25a0ay'ine had been coaled on the 23d and 2<th.

f Â£e also said that the weather for that day
\ jb bad. The witness said that late in the
Lrternoon of May 26 the intermediate valve of
;fce collier was broken, but previous to the
arrival off Santiago she had not been "broken
iowa, disabled or delayed."
A* .to the condition of the 26th the witness
, â¢' should say I could have coaled, as I find
hÂ»re (consulting the log) we were making ten

"We stoppei at 5:30 that afternoon."

Asked if v*: 'Pis could have been coaled
while the Me*mac was ln tow of the YaU.
the witness replied that that was a 6upposi

May 23 to Mi; 21, except on the days when

On cross-ea arnlnation Raynor questioned
Commander Mller concerning coaling from the
Merrimac on ti e 24th. He said the Massachu

of that ia.y. He was then examined concern

The question of shortening the period
of operation of the subsidy law from

old bill, to about twelve or fifteen years
will also be considered. ' Another matter
that. will come up before the conference,
it is understood, will be to fix a uniform
rate of subsidy of 1 cent per gross ton
for each one hundred nautical miles
covered by ships enjoying a Government
bounty.
In the old bill it was proposed to pay
one and a half cents for each one hun

around the proposition to pay subsidies
to foreign-built ships now owned, wholly
or In major part by Americans.
It will be recalled that it. was against
this provision of the old bill that the
greatest hostility was shown at the list
session of Congress, and it is understood
the aim of the conference at Boston \u25a0will
be to so frame this clause as not to ex
cite the same dangerous opposition. To
accomplish this purpose and at the wroe
time to carry out the "Idea embodied ln the
foreign tonnage feature of the bill I will
be a difficult matter, especially in vle-w
of the fact that since the adjournment

ALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
/f X. TV\. WASHINGTON, Sept. 30.
(I . â New life was given to the
Schley court of Inquiry to-day by
the prominence of the witnesses
who testified and the important charac
ter of their evidence. Rear Admiral
Evans, who, as captain, command
ed the battleship Iowa during the
Santiag-o campaign. was the most
prominent -witness before the court
to-day. His testimony covered the pe
riod from the time the Iowa left the port
of Key West on the 20th of May. 1898,
" until the 5th of July, when Admiral Evans
testified he had a conversation with Ad
miral Schley concerning the battle of the
3d. He described m detail the principal
battle of Santiago and gave particulars
concerning the bombardment of the Colon
on May SL
Other witnesses of the day were Cap
tain Theodore F. Jewell, who was com
mander of the cruiser Minneapolis during
the Spanish War, and Commander James
O. Miller, who was in command oi the
collier Merrimac until that vessel was
turned over to Lieutenant Hobson to be
sunk In the mouth of the harbor of San
tiago. Admiral Evans bad not concluded
his testimony when the court adjourned
until to-rr.orrow.
Coaling Question' -/AgainvV* '..Â¥*$
* "Would it have been possible for the. Iowa
to coal from the Merrimac on the afternoon* of
May -26?"- â¢
, "It would -have been." â¢
"j-VDo you>knowjof any reason why. the ships
could not get near, the collier on May 317"
if; VI know of no reason why they, could not."
:"Do you 'know whether \u25a0 there" is good an-
"Or. any written or verbal instructions V
â¢- "None .whatever." . -
\u25a0 '.'"What Instruction, verbal or written, did
you have from Commodore Schley relative to
the order \u25a0'Â»*. blockade or order of battle while
a part . of ! the , ; flying squadron?"
.' 'The ; order of blockade was to form column
double distance and cruise in that formation."
"Was there any prescribed order of battle by
which you .would have been guided. If the
enemy's ships had come out of Santiago harbor
prior to ' June . 1. 1898 ?' '
. "There was "none." \u25a0-" -T^-?;
- Returning to the departure of the flying
squadron from Cienfuegos Hanna asked : '
"What steps were taken, if any, to mark the
movements of that squadron in accordance with
orders?" . \u25a0 ' \u25a0\u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 . .- ...
"There were no lights shown on . the . flyfng
squadron 'on blockade except, 1 1 believe,' we
did have a light in the stern of each ship."
By the courtâ Was any . further effort made
by the flying squadron to destroy the Colon ?
. "None, if by "further" you mean the action
of May 31." ->_,
"Was the fire of the enemy's batteries on the
81st heavy enough ' to seriously endanger, the
attacking ships r f ; ,
"No," sir, it was not heavy -at all.'. The pro
jectiles mostly fell a long- ways short of us.
Two, ;I think, passed over my: ship." 'â¢:â¢ -[\u25a0 '
. "In the attack on the Colon on May 31 did
any of the enemy's shells fall near the squad
ron?" n .-\u25a0â¢-' â¢ â¢ , â¢ â¢ . \u25a0 \u25a0
"Two. I think, fell- near the Iowa."
Raynor then surrendered I the witness tempo
rarily, saying that he would have further ques
tions to ask, but that he desired time to pre
pare them. It was arranged that these ques
tions could be deferred until to-morrow, and
ln the meantime Captain Lemly made some
interrogations before the redirect examination.
He asked: ' . ; - \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 -
"Under what instructions, r verbal, written or
by signal from the flagship Brooklyn, did you
maneuver ; the Iowa during - tbe naval battle
off Santiago harbor . on July 8, 189S?"
â¢--"I never, saw any signal 'from her. I did
hot maneuver in obedience to any signal from
the Brooklyn. I did not see any signals aboard
her." >
Lemly Asks Questions.
"I never said that; absolutely. I never said
such a thing because the Texas was right
under my eye all the time. She did not turn
at all." ' .-.
Concerning the position of the Brooklyn and
Texas on the day of the battle, the 'witness
said: .
"The Brooklyn was dangerously near the
Texas. I should say within 100 yards of her."
"What was your position. Just at that time
when she crossed - the course of the Texas,
relative to the Brooklyn and Texas?"
"The Iowa was heading straight in for the
Spanish - fleet to intercept the VizcSya at that
time. She was heading more to the northward
than the Texas. The Texas was headed ott
more to the west. When I saw the Brooklyn
the third time she was across the bow of the
Texas, heading south."
"When did you see her next, if at all?"
"After the Oquendo went ashore my atten
tion was called to the Brooklyn by some one
on the bridge. v?ho remarked: 'The Brooklyn
is knocked out.' She. was then hotly engaged
with her starboard battery. She- . was headed
parallel with the course of the Colon, I should
say." . â¢ \u25a0
Raynor questioned the witness again with ref
erence to statements made in his (Admiral
Evans') book, asking himwhether he had ever
said he felt reasonably sure that the Spanish
fleet was in the harbor at Santiago. The wit
ness said that he had , made . that '. statement,
but that it was a conclusion based on the. fact
that the Spaniards were;" not at "Cienfuegos;
that they had not gone ' westward and that
from a military point of view Santiago was
the place where they were most apt. to be.
"That was simply your opinion then and not
a'- matter of information?" suggested Raynor,
to which the witness replied in the affirmative.
- Raynor then remarked that he had never be
fore understood upon what the . admiral had
based his statements.
"I think you did," said the admiral.
"I assure you I had never read it before,"
responded Raynor.
"You have read it three times to me. so that
you cannot say that you never, read the state
ment before." â¢ . â¢ . "\u25a0'.-\u25a0â¢
Admiral Deweyâ Remarks will be confined to
questions and answers. .
Admiral Evans, ln response to a question
from Raynor, said he had been called to tbe
deck of the Iowa on the evening of July 2 by
Lieutenant Hill, who was the deck \ officer and
who had called his attention to columns of
smoke arising. from the entrance to the harbor.
The' lieutenant- had remarked that It was his
opinion that the Spaniards were preparing .to
come out, but he (Admiral Evans) expressed
the opinion that. they were only shifting their
berths, as they had done on previous occa
sions. However, the signal at that time had
been prepared and was kept In readiness all
night. Baying that the enemy was escaping.
Dangerously Near the Texas.
Signals at Cienfuegos.
Raynor questioned Admiral Evans at some
length concerning the signals as displayed on the
coast near Cientuegos, which the admiral said
the officer of the deck had told him had been
seen on May 22 and 23, but -the witness said that
he ' had - had no conversation with Admiral
Schley about these lights and had made no re
port to him of their appearance or significance.
Raynor then changed his base of his exam
ination from Cienfuegos to Santiago, and began
by asking Admiral Evans if he had seen the
official chart showing the positions of the
Brooklyn and other battleships on the day of
the battle of Santiago, July 3, 189S. The ad
miral replied that he "had seen the chart, but
that it was wrong.
"When did you first know about the turn of
the Brooklyn, as you say, a short distance from
the Texas r*
"When I saw her cross- the bow of the
Texas." â¢ .
"Do you recollect the conversation you had
with Commodore Schley the 5th of July, the
second day after the battle, regarding the loop
of the Brooklyn?"
"No, sir; I do not. I do not remember men
tioning the subject at all."
"You do not recollect that Commodore Schley
first told you on July 5 that it was the Brook
lyn, and not the Texas, that made the turn?"
"I never imagined anything of the sort." '
"Give briefly the purport of your conversation
on that date with Commodore Schley."
"Briefly, as I recollect the conversation, he
was talking to a person named Graham. He
was sitting at his desk, writing. I walked into
his cabin to make a report. He put his hand
on my- shoulder and said: 'Bobby, I am Just
writing ' my report of â¢ the battle of the 3d of
July.' ...
"He said:. 'I have said of you that you
handled your ship with consummate skill.' ' He
then Introduced . me to Mr. Graham. Captain
Cook came in and asked -me If I would tell

One of the most important questions
pertaining to the new bill which will
come before. -this conference centers
\u25a0jf^kLL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
/J N. W., WASHINGTON, Sept.' 30.â
(L .A new ship subsidy bill wlll.be
>^^ Introduced In the Senate early ln
the next session <t Congress It
will differ from the measure which Sen
ator's Frye and Hanna made such a
strenuous effort to have passed last win
ter.' What the modifications will be are
to be . determined between this time and
December, but it is Intended they shall
not alter the old bill in any 1 radical man
ner. .Some efforts will be made, however,
to make the new measure acceptable to
those who opposed the old one.
Advocates of ship subsidy purpose be
ginning early, in bringing the issue to the
front at the' coming session. A confer
ence' is scheduled to be held In. Boston
to-morrow or on -Wednesday, at which
a draft of the new bill will be considered.
There will be present Senators Hanna and
Frye, Representative Littlefteld of Maine,
President Griscom of the International
Navigation Company â¢ and a few others
who are* interested In building up the
measure. Senator Hanna was due to ar
rive in Boston to-day. He has been at
Bath, Me., where the United States
cruiser Cleveland and a large ocean sail

Frye have been launched.
Subsidy Features.
"About five minutes tr. 1 I sow the first 'shot
from (be Massachusetts tfr'<l thort a long dls-
than we found off Cienfuegos unless going very
far to the eastward."
"Could you have coaled any of the vessels on
May 25 had you been ordered to do so?"
"I should judge so, to the best of my knowl
edge and belief. I say I could coal, yes, I
could coal at any time, but then I could not
have coaled comiortably. For the other ships
it was what we call a nasty sea and squally,
rainy weather, and If I had my choice I would
not have coaled on that day; that is, the 2oth."
As he left the stand Captain Miller asked
that he might be excused If he had shown any
temper.
"I feel a little bit touchy about the Merri
mac," he said.
Admiral Dewey assured him that he had
displayed no temper.
Captain Jewell a "Witness.
Captain Miller was succeeded on the witnese
stand by Captain Theodore J. Jewell, who com
manded the cruiser Minneapolis during the
Spanish war.
Captain Jewell said that he had first fallen in
with the flying squadron under command of
Commodore Schley on the evening of May 26.
Captain Lemly quoted from Admiral Schley's
letter to the Senate Committee on Naval Af
fairs, dated February IS. 1S99, saying:
"After havlnsr been informed by the scouts
commanded by such olflcers as Sissbee, Jew
ell and Wise that, although they had been off
Santiago for a week, they had Been nothing of
Cervera's fleet since it left Curacao," and asked
whether he had given to Admiral Schley this
Information or any other Information concern-
Ing the Spanish fleet, the witness replied:
"I gave him no Information with reference to
the subject whatever."
"At the time you were within signaling dis
tance of the flagship of the flying squadron off
Santiago, were you at any time asked . any
questions by Commodore Schley as to the pres
ence of the Spanish squadron in Santiago?'
"Xot to my recollection."
"Do you recollect whether you went on board
the flagship Brooklyn at this time?"
"I did not go on board that day."
Captain Jewell said that when he had first
seen Admiral Schley's statement as to the In
formation he might have given concerning Cer
vera's fleet, he had written a letter to the de
partment denying that he had done so. Objec
tion was made to this line of testimony, and it
was not persisted in. The witness said in reply
*â¢â¢Â» a question from Raynor that he had no
knowledge that Captain Sigsbee, speaking for
himself and Cantalns Jewell and Wise, stated
to Commodore Schley on the 26th at Santiago
that neither he (the witness) nor Wise nor
himself (Sigsbee) had seen anything or knew
anything of the movements or whereabouts of
the Spanish fleet. Nor did he know whether
Captain Slgsbee wrote a letter to Commodore
Schley stating that that was a fact.
Mixed as to Distances.
The court here asked a question which opened
up the coaling question. The question was:
"How faV cquld the Minneapolis have gone
with , her 400 teas of coal at the time you
stater* \u25a0
"If I had bunjed 4C0 tons of coal I would
have made something like twelve or thirteen
hundred miles. Iliat would have left the bunk
ers empty. I was burning about ninety-five
tons a day, and on that making fourteen or fif
teen knots."
Drawing from Captain Jewell the fact that
the distance from Santiago to Key West is 850
miles, Mr. Raynor said:
"In view of what you said just now, will you
explain the signals I read: '8:30 p. m.. May 26,
flagship to the Minneapolis: Have you enough
coal to go to Key West?* 'Minneapolis to flag
ship: Just enough.' How do you explain
that?"
"I am giving my recollection at the time. As
I said, my coa! supply was reduced, and I was
concerned. There were a great many signals
being made, and I replied to the signal without
consulting the coal amount particularly, and I
considered that three days" steaming was about
the limit I could safely go."
"There is an error her* of about five to six
hundred miles. Eight hundred 1300 or 1400 are
very different."
"I estimated the distance I could steam. I
did not usually r provide for burning every ounce
of coal in the bunkers, and, \u25a0 furthermore, we
have got to allow for contingencies. I was

"I arrived 13 Key West with less than 100
tons of coal on board."
Captain Jewe I was then excused and Captain
McCalla was retailed for the purpose of correct
ing his testimcty. While he was on the stand
the court aske; him two questions, which, to
gether with thi replies, were as follows:
By the court- -Was there any place in the vi
cinity of Cape Cruz where large vessels could
have found protection from westerly or south
westerly winds?
"There was no place where the larger ships
could take protection from westerly and south
westerly winds. The prevailing winds were
from the east and a southwesterly wind is of
short duration In that vicinity and means
change of direction to the north very quickly."
By the courtâ Had the fleet of Cervera been
In the harbor of Cienfuegos, could it have been
seen by the vessels blockading that port?
"I should say The upper part of the
masts might have been seen if they had been
in the stretch of the river where It turns to the
east, but I should not expect to have found
them there. If they were behind the hill they
could not have been seen, in my opinion."
Captain McCalla was then excused finally and
the court adjourned for luncheon.
Admiral Evans Talks.
When the court convened for the afternoon
session Bear Admiral Robley D. Evans, who
as captain commanded the battleship Iowa
during the battle off Santiago, was called to
the witness stand. He stated that he had first
joined the flying squadron off Cienfuegos on
Hay 22 at 1 p. m., when he took the dispatches
from Admiral Sampson to Commodore Schley
by his executive officer. Commander Rogers,
he not seeing the commodore himself As the
dispatches were sealed he did not. know their
contents.
Judge Advocateâ Please state what. If any
thing, was done while this squadron was off
Onfuegos toward developing the fact as to
whether the Spanish squadron under Admiral
Cervera was or was not in the harbor of Cien
fuegos.
"There was nothing done so far as I know."
"What, if anything, within your knowledge
was done toward destroying or preventing the
further completion of the enemy's batteries in
the vicinity of Cienfuegos?" * ln
"Sn Sunday afternoon I am quite sure Com
modore Schley formed his squadron in columns
and stood Jn to a range of about a mile and
a half from shore, made a turn and stood out
again. That is the only thing I know of."
"Was any attack made upon the enemy or bv
the enemy at that time?" '
- "No. sir; they all got up and stood on the
breastworks and looked at us. We steamed'
out again. There was no firing on either side "
"Were you then within range of, the bat
teries ln the vicinity of Cienfuegos with the
heavier guns of your ship?"
"I did not see any batteries. There wu a
work they were completing there."
"Were you within range of this?"
"Quite easy range; yes."
"ThÂ» battery of the Iowa consisted of what?"
â¢ "Four twelve-inch, eight eight-inch and
twelve four-Inch guns." . . -
"Were those embryo batteries within range
of your eight-inch guns when you steamed ln?"
"They were within easy range."
"Were they within range of the four-Inch
gun*?"
"I should think so; yes."
"Did the Iowa coal ship while ln Clenrueros
and If so. how much did she taker*
"We took In 250 tons of coal on the 23d. "We

Admiral E%'ans said that he had coaled the
Iowa from the IMerrlmac on May 23, while off
Cienfuegos, and that he had had no difficulty
ln doinr so. J
Speaking of tHe report of the condition of
the weather mad* by the Iowa on May 24 and

evening of the 26th, and at that . time the
squadron was heading to the east. The
weather at that time, he said, was -not such
as to prevent th<Â» coaling of ships at that date
The Iowa at that time had about 825 tons of'
coal aboard or sufficient for steaming 3000

BAD COMPLEXION.
The skin is tbe seat of an almost end-
less variety of diseases. They are knewu *
by various names, but are all due to the
same cause, acid and other poisons in
the blood that irritate and interfere with
the proper action of the skin.
To have a smooth, soft skin, free from!
all eruptions, the blood must be kept pure
and healthy. The many preparations 'of
arsenic and potash and the large number
of face powders and lotions generally
used in this class of diseases cover up
for a short time, but cannot remove per-
manently the ugly blotches and the red,
disfiguring pimples.

CHICAGO, Sept. 3O.-Secretary of the
Treasury Gage, who is spending a few
days at the home of his son in Evanston
before going to Colorado to spend his va
cation, said in regard to the present
large surplus in the Treasury:
The prosperous condition of the country mast
be moat gratifying. The decrease in the ex
penditures of the Government, however, 1Â» a
salient factor In the Increase In the *ur:!uÂ»
in the last three months. From June 3A, 301
to September 26, the revenue amounted to
J136.0CO.000. The expenditures during this time
were $121,000,000. This left an excess of nnrly
$15,000,000. During the same period in 1900 the
receipts were $133,000,000 and the expenditures
the same.' Of course, the fact must be taXen
Into consideration that the revenue for the last
three months was under the lowered schedule,
so that the $136,000,000 receipts this year repre
sents a larger amount of business transacted
than during the same time last year, when tha
$139,000,000 was received.
It was estimated when â¢ the present revised
revenue law was put In force on. July I that
the revenue receipts from all sources would
fall off some $40,000,000 by reason of the re
ductions made. If that had been* realized the
receipts since that time would have teen $7,500 -
000 less, or $128,500,000. Notwithstanding the
reduction in. taxes. the> receipts- h.ve dimin

AUSTIN, Texas, Sept. 30.â The commu
nity of interests spirit which has recent
ly shown such great advancement .in
Mexico Is likely to receivo a severe shock
before long. It is reported on reliable
authority that President Diaz is consid
ering the advisability of putting a check
on the growth of the trusts in that
country by issuing an official decree pro
hibiting such practices. He has been ap
pealed to for relief by many mine own
ers, who allege that the American Mining
and Smelting Company, in Its effort to
control the output and price of ores, has
closed down without cause some of the
best mines in the Sierra Mojada and
other mining districts of the republic. It
is also stated. that the independent mine
owners are placed at the mercy of the
trust and are without relief, as all the
smelters in Mexico are In the gigantic
organization. It Is said that President
Diaz does not look -with favor upon the
movement to consolidate the railroad
lines of Mexico into one or two groups.
He believes that such action will
tend to prevent the extension of
the existing systems, and to re
.tard the development of the coun
try. There is some talk that he will not
approve the recent purchase of the Mon
terey and Mexican Gulf Railroad by the
Mexican Central Railway Company.

NEW YORK, Sept. SO.â The American
clipper ship Iroquois arrived in port this
afternoon dismasted and with con
siderable damage about her decks,
caused by her encounter with a. hur
ricane in the North Atlantic. Captain
Thompson reported that September 19, in
latitude 18.50 north, longitude 53 west, the
weather became very threatening, accom
panied by hurricane squalls. At 6 a. m.
the ship was struck by a terrific squall,
which carried away the mizzen mast
about twenty feet from the deck. The
falling spars carried away the main top
masthead, and the spars and rigging
came tumbling down on deck, smashing
the port lifeboat, the port side and rail
of the afterhouse, and doing considerable
damage about the decks. None of the
crew was injured. The vessel was hove
to and the decks cleared of wreckage,
when she proceeded on her course. All
went well until September 26, when the
ship ran into a violent hurricane, blowing
with great fury for two days. Captain
Thompson was again obliged to heave to
for thirty-eight hours and lost his main
lower topsail end staysail. On the 27th
the ship resumed the voyage, carrying a
strong breeze up to Barnegat.

AMERICAN CLIPPER SHIP
DISMASTED IN A STORM
Tinted States Infantry, on duty at West-
Uiwn Cemetery, guarding the resting place
i f President McKinley, worked diligently
:o-day investigating the strange story in
which Private Deprend, who was on duty
at the top of the vault Sunday night, fig
ured so prominently. The military regula
tions which prevented the officers and j
men from making detailed statements
concerning the incidents last night were
as rig-idly observed to-day.
All of the commissioned officers and
members of the company in general last
night accepted fully the story related by
Private Dfprerd.and really believed that
prowlers were about the vault with no
good purpose. To-day only one of the
commissioned officers adhered to the be
lief that an assault had been made upon
the sentinel by ghouls. He said:
It was the real thing: it was prompted by the
pure cussedness of some people who thought to
bring reijr'.ach upon the nation by doing dam
ape to the resting place of the dead Presi
dent.
All the men who were seen to-day ex
pressed the belief that Private Deprend
acted in good faith and that he related
only what he believed to be the real facts.
"With the captain and others he went over
the details of the whole affair at least a
dozen times and it is said never varied in
a matter of irnDortance.
Particular inauiry was made as to liis
sobriety at the lime, and it is said that
it is established beyond all reasonable
doubt that he had not been drinking and
that he was in his normal condition. The
most common belief is that the sentinel
was overwrought by the loneliness of his
position, that his nerves were overtaxed
and that imagination contributed some of
the details related in good faith. ' The
post was regarded by all as particularly
isolated and depressing to the man guard
ing it at night and it is said more senti
nels will be stationed at the point in the
future.
Captain Biddle thanked the reporters for
â¢what he called the fair manner in which
the incident had been described In the
morning papers, saying they gave a full
and complete statement of facts so far
as revealed last night. He was fully con
vinced last night of the truth of the story
as related, but after investigation enter
tained doubts, not of the sincerity of
Private Deprend, but of the correctness
of the conclusions.
Captain Biddle authorized this state
ment:
I think the sentinel deceived himself on the
occurrence. I do not think an actual attack
as related by him occurred. When, daylight

The matter had been reported in full
to General Otis at Chicago, commanding
the department to which the guard is at
tached. Whether there will be a formal
inquiry into the matter remains for Gen

cemetery express the hope that inasmuch
as no actual harm had been done no
formal action would be taken.

have heard remarks Sunday afternoon

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W. f WASHINGTON, Sept. 30.â President
Roosevelt to-day received from the Treas
ury Department his first pay as Presi
dent. It was a check for $2017 74, and Is
the pay for seventeen days of the month
of September. â¢ The estate of President
McKinley will be paid a check for $1856 88.
There was a good, deal of discussion In
the treasury about these checks and ex
actly how to divide them. President Mc-
Kinley died early on the morning of Sep
tember 14, and President Roosevelt took
oath that day. Under the law Roosevelt
must be paid. the salary of President from
and Including the day he took the oath of
office. The question was not this, how
ever. For a number of years each Presi
dent has been paid monthly one-twelfth
of $50,000 a year, the only case in the Gov
ernment service in which the regular sal
ary table was not followed. By this sys
tem President McKinley received $4166 66
for two months in every quarter and
$4166 67 for the third month of the quar
ter, making the total for the quarter $12,
500. As September was the third month
of the quarter the salary for that month
was $4166 67. Divided by thirty days the
proportion going to President Roosevelt
would have been $2361 and to the estate
of the dead President $1SO5 44. The Audi
tor's office insisted on a division on the
basis that President Roosevelt should re
ceive seventeen-ninety-seconds of the en
tire salary for the third quarter of a year,
there being ninety-two days in that quar
ter.

DEMOCRATS MEET IN MUNICIPAL
CONVENTION, BUT SOON ADJOURN
Permanent Organization Is Effected by the Appointment of Com
mittees to Arrange Order of Business to Be Followed.
A small crowd. gathered about the main
exit.
It was 9 o'clock when Jasper McDon
ald called the convention to order. Secre
tary Hickey called the roll as certified to
by Registrar Walsh, but eighty of the ac
credited delegates failed to answer to
their names. There was a contest in sev
eral districts where opposing delegations
received the same number of votes. A
system was evolved by which each con
testant was allowed half a vote. A con
flict was thus avoided.
A. S. 'Maguire named "W. J. McGee of
the Forty-flfth District as permanent
chairman. There was no opposition to
this and after the perfunctory motions
required by the election statutes had
been complied with Mccfee took the chair.
He said the honor was unsought, that he
would administer justice "with special
privileges to none and equal rights to
all." (

Suitor and Sweetheart
Are Slain by Jealous
Brothers.
DESOTO. Mo., Sept. 30.â After being
\u25a0wea-ted eight hours William Greenhill to
night made a confession to Prosecuting
Attorney Williams, in which he saj-s his
brother, Daniel Greenhill, killed their
Bister, Mrs. Sadie TJren, and her suitor,
John Meloy. The confession says that the
brothers objected to Meloy's attention to
thntr sister because he was a spendthrift
and wanted to marry Mrs. Uren for her
money. On the night of the murder, Sat
urday last, Daniel entered the room of
Mrs. "Uren, according to the confession,
and found the woman sitting on Meloy's
lap. In a fit of rage Greenhill grabbed
a hatchet and sunk it Into the skull of
Meloy, after which he brained his sister.
He then took a revolver from Meloy's
pocket and fired into the wounds he had
inflicted with the hatchet.
After the confession a warrant was
sworn out for the arrest of Calip Andrews
as an accessory, and he was arrested.
The confession does not implicate An
drews, but it intimates that he was a wit
ness to the murder. Andrews inquired
anxiously of the prosecutor if he would be
treated more leniently If he made a stated
ment, and it 13 believed he will confess
to-morrow. The Greenhills and Andrews
are heavily guarded to-night.
The trio will be taken to Hillsboro to
morrow morning to prevent lynching, as
tr-Â» feeling is intense.
* John Meloy belonged to a good family.
It was generally understood that he was
to marry Mrs. Uren, and It is known
that the match was not pleasing to the
woman's brothers.
Mrs. Uren was the daughter of Robert
Greenhlll, a prosperous citizen. She kept
several fine horses, owned much property
and dressed in the height of fashion.
What seems to be the absence of a sense
of humor Is often merely the presence of
a sense of propriety.
We declare that Henry T. Gage as Governor
of the State of California has kept the prom
ises he made to the people and upon the faith
of â¢which â¢ he waa elected. He has truly ful

To the Republican municipal convention:
Tour committee on platform and resolutions
recommend the adoption of the following reso
lutions:
Chairman Riordan, upon calling the con
vention to order, recognized General War
field, chairman of the platform commit
tee, whom . he announced would â¢ read a
sypplemental report of that body". The
resolution, which was commendatory of
Governor Gage and his administration,
follows^:
ernor Gage's administration was
also indorsed. General R. H. \u25a0Warfleld
went to the front and center and sub
mitted from the committee on platform
a supplemental report wherein Gage was
exalted as a great and good Republican
Governor. â¢ The committee In preparing
the original report quite forgot or Inten
tionally Ignored the existence of the Gov
ernor, and he never would have been men
tioned in the annals of the convention If
The Call had not gone to his rescue. This
paper did not stop to Inquire whether the
omission was by accident or design, but
insisted that the committee on resolutions
should hand out a package to Gage even
If the offering resembled a gold brick.
For rawness of work and tor dumb, list
less, tame submission to a boss pro
gramme nothing In the history of politics
in this city quite equals the record made
by the Republican local convention at
B'nai B'rith Hall last night. Delegates
bowed their heads in shameful acquies
ence.
There was no spirit or enthusiasm In
the business: The blanket was so wet
and cold that every sign of vitality was
extinguished. The nomination of Asa R.
Wells was received in a cheerless, unre
sponsive manner. As there was no other
candidate, the ballot of the convention
was cast for him in perfunctory style.
And so it went all along the line. Not a
word of protest was uttered against the
execution of the programme agreed upon
at the Palace Hotel conferences, at which
W. F. Herrln and Colonel D. M. Burns
named the ticket. A shout of merriment
was the response to an unguarded ex
pression of Eugene Berri in placing Bert
Mahoney in nomination for County Clerk.
â¢He remarked that "everything was going
smoothly." The convention broke into
laughter, and Berri, trying to mend mat
ters by explaining that he was not think
ing of a slate, made the break more
laughable.
An amusing Incident occurred during
the session, which was appreciated by
the delegates and spectators who "caught
on." When the proceedings were well
under way in the densely packed hall,
Jasper McDonald, chairman of the Demo
cratic County Committee, slowly pressed
his way through the throng to the steps
of the stage. Some of the observers fan
cied that Mr. McDonald's presence was a
graceful compliment to the Republicans,
but when it transpired that he had come
to the B'nai B'rith Hall to open the
Democratic Convention, instead of hav
ing gone to Odd Fellows' Hall, where the
Democrats were assembling, the com
ment was amusing. Surely all political
delegations look alike to Jasper McDon
ald!
FIVE of the seven nominations
made by the Republican Conven
tion last night were forecasted by

DOUBLE MURDER
STOPS MARRIAGE
TACOMA, Sept. SO.â Shanghai advices
state that the news from Singanfu con
firms the previous reports of the serious
ness of the famine In Shensi Province..
"Within the city there are seventy-two
kitchens constantly preparing millet
RTuel for the starving and yet the daily
death rate Is said to be more than TOO.
The Empress Dowager is so anxious that
relief be honestly administered that she
beheaded two officials found guilty of dis
honesty. She Is exceedingly popular with
the people because the presence of the
court has compelled the abolition of the
restriction that grain cannot be imported
from another province. Rice Is, therefore,
being bought in Honan Huphi and Sze
ohuan. Although the price Is ten times
the normal value the supply Is fairly reg
ular.
Rain has fallen, but not 20 per cent of
the land has been sown, as there are so
few animals and feed could not be bought.
This means a continuation of the desti
tution until the spring cf 1903â a very seri
ous outlook for the people In view of the
"winter's cold.
Famine fever Is raging- and claiming
victims. It is estimated by missionaries
that not less than 200,000 inhabitants of
Shensi will have perished by the time,
next season's crop is harvested.
In some towns the scenes of destitution
and starvation are appalling, being simi
lar to the famine situation in the worst
districts cf India. The dead are burled
many deep in long trenches and the
mourners are too weak and emaciated to
properly observe the funeral rites.
The entire Chinese court is saddened by
the destitution and some of its members
are making heroic efforts to relieve the
situation. The Empress r>owager herself
ha? several times assisted serving soup
arid rice to the si'.ffering. She daily en
courages the rendering cf all possible as
sistance and has set apart a portion of
all contributions of cash and produce
from other provinces for distribution
among the famine sufferers.

the end that taxation may be reduced to the

the fact that during that grave emergency
when the city was a scene of excitement by
reason of an alleged discovery of the exist
ence of the bubonlo plague the chief executive
of the State commenced an Independent Inves
tigation, and the result of his official inquiry
convinced the world that bubonic plague did
not then and never did exist within thÂ« bor
ders of this State.
Adopt Committee's Report.
The report was adopted unanimously.
Lucius Solomons stepped upon the stage
after the adoption of General Warfleld's
report to nominate Auditor Asa R. Wells
for Mayor. Solomons paid Wells a
glowing tribute and said that he had
earned reward for his years of faithful
public service.
"It Is my pleasure, gentlemen of the con
vention," Bald Mr. Solomons, "to place In
nomination for the Chief Executive .of
San Francisco Mr. Asa R. Wells."
General Warfleld seconded the nomina
tion, declaring that he had no doubt that
Mr. Wells would be elected by a large
majority.

Fight With Dave Sulli
van Proves a Fast and
Furious One.
Gong Twice Saves the New
York Lad From Being
Counted Out.
LOUISVILLE, Sept. 30.â Kid Broad of
Cleveland was to-night given the decision
over Dave Sullivan of New York, after
twenty-five 6f the fastest rounds ever
seen here. ! The contest took place before
the* Southerrn Athletic Club and 5000 per
sons saw it. The men fought at 126 pounds
and both were In fine condition.
In the earlier rounds Sullivan waa the
aggressor, but did no damage. The Kid
got down. to business in the fifth round
and forced matters. The fifth was Broad's
all the way. He made Sullivan dance all
over the mat and got in some vicious
swings to the wind, kidneys and face.
Sullivan was apparently badly rattled. In
the sixth round Broad . landed a dozen
times to head and received several light
ones in return. In the seventh Sullivan
dropped a straight right on Broad's eye,
and that organ was soon all but closed.
. ThÂ© eighth was the hottest round ever
seen here. They rushed at each other
with right and left swings, uppercuta,
straight rights and lefts and each made a
veritable chopping block of the other be
fore the referee could make them, break
under the rules.
In the ninth Â«round Broad received sev
eral hard straight rights on his damaged
eye. Honors were even in the tenth. The
eleventh round found Sullivan the aggres
sor. He did the better work as to points,
though . his blows lacked steam, in the
twelrth Sullivan was groggy and the gong
was all that saved him. In the thirteenth
Sullivan was forced to the ropes time and
again and was getting notably weaker,
his eye was almost closed and his mouth
was bleeding.
Sullivan's wonderful recuperative power
asserted itself in the fourteenth round
and the round ended in his favor. In the
sixteenth Sullivan began to weaken
again, Broad having him all but out.
Broad poured dozens of upper-cuts to
Sullivan's wind in the seventeenth round
and Sullivan's distress was only too evi
dent. Mercilessly Broad kept after him,
and once more, when another stiff punch
would have ended the fight the bell
tapped. The eighteenth round, however,
brought the New- York boy up apparently
strong and fresh and both did some very
pretty work, Sullivan rushing for a knock
out and Broad allowing him to expend his
energy. â¢ :
Matters were about even In the nine
teenth, but the twentieth was decidedly
Broad's. Several times he rushed Sulli
van to the ropes and did his best to chop
him down.
In the twenty-first round Sullvan struck
Broad rather low in >the stomach and
Broad appeared to be in such agony that
many thought he was going out. He went
through the round, however. The crowd
howled and cheered him when he came
up in the twenty-second round and. after
some of the fastest fighting ever seen
anywhere, he had the New York boy al
most asleep when the gong once more
saved him.
Both came up very tired in the twenty
third round, though Dave was the
stronger of the two. They swung wildly
and did no damage. Thus they fought the
next two rounds, at the conclusion of
which Referee Hurst declared Broad the
winner. â¢

LIVELY FISTIC BOUTS AT
- THE HAYES VALLEY CLUB
JOHN M. NEALL FOUND
GUILTY OF FORGERY
Gentlemen of the Convention: Three years
ago I stood before you as candidate for Audit
or of this city. I said then I would like to
go to the City Hall for a. term to see why It
was that the city's business could not be run
on the same lines as a business house down
town. I was elected to the office and I have
been In the City Hall, .and I think you have
heard of me. and I am "able to report to you
tried, but got a bit tangled and said, "I
didn't know his name until a few minutes
ago." . \u25a0â¢\u25a0 . â¢ â¢â¢ , ,
\u25a0 The delegates roared and Mr. Berri
scented the fact that he had been, guilty
of making a great big error. . .
"This wasn't a' slate proposition," ex
plained Mr. Berri, with difficulty. He fin
ally made it clear that the gentleman was
A. B. Mahoney, whom he wished'to nomi
nate for County Clerk, and that the
trouble arose because he did not know his
full Christian name until a short time
before he placed him in" nomination. Like
most people Mr. Berri had always called
Mr. Mahoney, Bert. After a struggle the
delegates were advised that he was Albert
Blake Mahoney. Mr. Mahoney was nomi
nated for County Clerk without opposi
tion. ,
Mr. Wells arrived at this time and was
ushered to the stage. He spoke as fol
lows: 1 .
Eugene D. Berri of the TTilrty-slxth
made the hit of the evening. Mr. Berri
surprised his hearers by saying that he
did not intend to work very hard. "Things
are going along very smoothly," he said.
This startling admission amused the dele
gates and appealed to their sense of
humor. Finally Mr. Berri announced that
It was his intention to nominate "one of
the best boys In Noe Valley."
Now If Mr. Berri had only mentioned

ballot for Mr. Wells for Mayor. The mo
tion prevailed and Mr. Wells was de
clared the nominee of the party.
Chairman Riordan informed the dele
gates that he had just received a tele
phone message from Mr." Wells to the
effect that he would not be able to reach
the convention hall for several minutes.
He stated that it was necessary for the
nominee to appear and indorse the plat
form, but thought that to facilitate mat

tions.
Edmund Tauszky was signaled by Chair
man Rlordan and he climbed gracefully
upon the stage. He placed Harry Baehr
In nomination for Auditor. Many orators
from various districts and a big-lunged
man in the gallery were profuse in
their efforts to second him. Mr.- Baehr
was duly nominated by acclamation, after
Delegate Harry Larsen of the Fortieth
had caused considerable laughter by de
claring that he was making "a nomina
tion that the motions' close." -
Mr. Baehr appeared. He was greeted
most enthusiastically by the convention,
and upon Chairman Riordan announcing
that his $10 nomination fee had been paid,
nominations for other offices were called
for.
Delegate Thomas L. Henderson of the
Thirty-seventh placed Arthur G. Flsk in
nomination for District Attorney. Dele
gate Partridge was his second. Mr. Flsk
made a neat little speech, thanking the
convention for the nomination and prom
ising to do all in his power to help the
ticket to success. .

form. The nominee Indorsed the platform
and promised he would labor to elect the
entire ticket.
Merten C. Allen placed Charles E.
Corey in nomination for the office of Re
corder. Leon Samuels of the Twenty
ninth seconded the nomination in a short
but eloquent speech. There being no
further nominations the ballot of the con
vention 1 was. cast for Mr. Corey. His
speech of acceptance was short and to the
point. He (pledged himself to the princi
ples of the platform and thanked the dele
gates for their action.
Nominations for the office of City At
torney was in order and G. Clifford Me-
Clellan'- of the Thirty-fourth District
named Frank McGowan. Mr. ; Samuels
seconded the nomination. The nomina
tions closed and- the secretary was di
rected â¢ to cast the ballot for McGowan.
The latter assured the convention that he
appreciated its kindness and Informed the
delegates that It was a surprise to him.
\u25a0 He regretted that he could not accept
the nomination as he lacked twenty-six
days of being a five years' resident of this
city as required by the charter. This was
a great surprise to the delegates. The
convention was nonplused for the mo
ment, but Mr. Samuels retained his pres
ence of mmd and moved that nominations
for City Attorney be postponed until to
night.
Norman "W. Hall of the Thirty-ninth
District moved that the motion be laid on
the table. The motion prevailed and Sam
uels moved for a reconsideration on the
ground that he voted in the affirmative.
The motion for a reconsideration was then
put by Chairman Rlordan and Delegate
Keane rose to a point of order. He
claimed that Mr. Samuels having voted in
the affirmative could not ask for a re
consideration. The chairman sustained;
the point of order. Mr. Samuels tried to
stay the decision by saying he had made
a mistake. He could not be heard above
the Jeers of the delegates and he sat
down. John R. Hillman of the Thirty
seventh solved the problem. He moved
that the convention adjourn until to-night
and after a roll call his motion prevailed.
The convention will meet again in B'nai

\ Try. HEN -the fedetatioh' : of the Australian colo
\/\/ \nies was under'c 4 Â«Dnskiefation, a commission .
" " Y'^was appointed.by.'the'New\Zealand Govern! â¢
ment to investigate the plarn' and- report gs to" tKc-vexr \
pediency of uniting that
commission ; has reported 'adversely^to the -scfieml; .
The chief argument against it has been, the fact that;
New Zealand is separated from Australia by 1200
miles of ocean so that there could be no such thing
as community of defense in time of war, and more
over the New Zealanders are developing along lines
of theirown and could not be united in political har
mony with the Australians.
That the report would be adverse to federation has
been a" foregone conclusion, but nevertheless its.
formal submission to the Government is a matter of
some importance as an official declaration of the in
tention of the : New Zealanders to stand alone and
build up an empire of their own.
That remarkable commonwealth has entered upon
so many experiments in the way of state socialism
that, many people look upon it as a land where' the
inhabitants are more intent upon developing a new
form of society than anything else. That opinion,
however, is erroneous. The New Zealanders have
the imperial fever about as strongly as: the Austra
lians.*. There is already a movement amojig the lead
ers of the island to bring about the annexation to
New Zealand of the Fijis and numerous other groups
of. islands in that part of the ocean.'^Jti, fact the ;New
Zealanders proudly call their country tit Britain of
the South Seas, and they dream it will yet become to
\u25a0Australia.about what Great? Britain -is to continental
Europe.. i ' . .
\u25a0 rFor the present the New. : Zealanders are working
.away at state socialism. with a;,good deal of enthusi
asm. The results thus far Jhave" hot been wholly sat
isfactory, but-lhey.a're hoping for great things. They
have now something more than 2000 miles of state
railroads which cost them, an average of $40,000 a
mile. A recent- report say's the cash revenues for
1899 were something, more than .; $7,000,000 and the
expenditures something less than $5,000,000. Over
that showing Premier Seddon is rejoicing. He is re
ported as having said: "The railroads are the ser
vants of the people and should ..be run entirely in
their interests. It is not desired to make -a profit out
of them, arid therefore as revenues increase, freight
and passenger rates are reduced."' r â¢
-All of that sounds very fine. Meantime.it is to be
noted 'that late reports from the island are by no
means so rosy as the state socialists would' like them.
It has been found that the interference of the state
with certain lines of business has so disarranged the
industrial condition of the people that further inter
ferences will have to be undertaken to restore equili
brium. Thus at the recent* opening of the New Zea
land Parliament the Governor, Lord Ranfurly, stated
that it is' now necessary for the Government, to open
and operate a "state coal mine. That additional.inter
ference will of course in turn entail 'further 'state en-
Ferprises, and perhaps in "the riot* distant "future indi
vidual initiative will have;- been so far'jchecked that
the Government , will have- to establish, state : farms
to supply the .people .with food and state tailor, shops
to furnish them-, with' clothing, l " : . . â¢ , â¢
SINCE the Boer, leaders have shown no respect*
for Lord Kitchener's proclamation calling
upon them to surrender before' September. 15,.
he has taken, steps to. show them that he at least re-,
spects it and is going to live up to the warning lit
contained.. An. official publication has been issued 1 ,
at Pretoria announcing: the permanent banishment of
several Boer leaders captured since the date fixed for.
surrender, and another proclamation has been issued
providing for the sale of the properties of the burgh
ers who are still in the field. Thus the warning -of
the proclamation is being fulfilled sternly and harsh
ly. Those of the Boers who continue in the field
are to suffer the confiscation of their property, while
all leaders who are captured are to be sent into per
manent exile. â¢ ,
In spite of their harshness, the measures seen to
have availed little or nothing in advancing the British
cause. On the same day that brought the news of
'Kitchener's latest proclamations of confiscation and
banishment, there carrie reports from the correspon
dent of the- London Express that it is understood in
South" Africa that Kitchener has asked for 25,000
more seasoned' mounted men, and for authority to
hang rebels, traitors and murderers without referring
their cases to the home Government.
It is not at ailjikely that the report is strictly true;
but enough evidence' in addition to that contained in
it has been forthcoming from other sources to justi
fy the conclusion that the Dutch of Cape Colony are
now taking considerable part in the war and are
furnishing the Boers with arms'and ammunition and
with men to use them! It has been; clear for some
time that the Boers have found a means of recruiting
their'forces arid replenishing their- supplies. -< Recruits I
have joined them from America and from Europe and
supplies I have been 5 smuggled across â¢ the
â¢Portuguese territory, but it is not believed that these
\u25a0so'urces^ofiTreinfprcerncnt have furnished even a half
of- all the Boers have received, and therefore the con
clusiohis drawn that the people of Cape Colony have
gone. to. the .aid of the two republics, and that it is
from that source the Boers receive the help that
enables them to continue the war. t..
One)pf the notable features of the present phase of
the. struggle is that tiiÂ£ field ojf Boer activities, is
wider than :it was during the, first year. The Boer
forces have repeatedly penetrated into Cape Colony,
and have found sympathy and support. In fact there
is seemingly an imminent danger of a, widespread re

NEW ZEAL&ND'S^GREAIT PLANS;
FRANKLIN BREED, an elderly farmer living nearPaines
ville, Ohio, holds the distinction of having initiated John
D. Rockefeller into the oil business.
"Breed, you have got me into the oil business, head
and ears," said Mr. Rockefeller as he emerged from a
bayou of oil sediment and mud into which he had fallen while
attempting to cross a narrow log in the Titusville, Pa., oil
fields. This was in. 1862 and before the name of Rockefeller had
any significance in connection with oil.
"In. 1858,"' said Mr." Breed, "I was one of the firm of Breed
& Hancox, which was engaged in the milling business at Titus
ville, my. native town. It was nearahis town that oil was first
discovered in the United States, at least in paying quantities.
"At about this time, as a milling firm, we were dealing with
commission merchants in Cleveland by the name of Clark &
Rockefeller. The Rockefeller of this firm was John D. Rocke
feller of present' day fame. > We bought considerable grain from
Clark & Rockefeller-^-in fact, our business ran way up into the
thousands annually^-and we. we.re back and forth between.
Cleveland and Titusville auite' often.
~ â¢â¢"While ori a trip to Cleveland in December, 1862, Mr. Rocke
feller asked, me many questions about the oil country near my
home. He had read a great deal about the new El Dorado,
and when we had transacted our other business he seemed
much interested in learning all he could of the prospects and
probable future development of the Titusville districts., In re
ply to his query regarding the chance for buying oil in goodly
quantities, I replied that I would sell him all he wanted, where
upon he agreed to visit my well on the old Story farm within
the next -few days. "We had our conversation on Friday.
, "On Monday, about sundown, Mr. Rockefeller arrived at
Titusville, and qn Tuesday morning wjr started for my well,
which was in the heart of the oil fields, some seven miles dis
tant. The wells were situated near what was known as Oil
Creek. The location was called Petroleum Center. It was not
connected with the outside world at that time by a passenger
service, so our journey was made on horseback, except the last
half mile, which' we walked. ... .
"The weather was not particularly favorable for a walk in
this section of the country In December. Snow had fallen to
the depth of four or .five Inches during the night and the
ground was muddy. Mr. Rockefeller was attired in a neat
fitting, light-colored suit of clothes, and also wore a light over
coat. His gloves were of kid and fur-lined. His entire outfit
was an expensive one, and one whlclt most men would regret
much to see soiled even by mud. â¢;
"In our path from my oil well to the laborers' shanty we
were obliged to cross a bayou. This bayou was about 100 rod3
long and six feet In width. Into it the oil men threw the sedi
ment from the big tanks. This, with the mud, formed a tarry
conglomeration, which was anything but inviting. The bayou
was spanned by a. Jog perhaps a half foot thick. The snow of
the previous night had the effect of making It slippery. I
crossed and then turned to wait for Rockefeller. He asked
me to take his hand, but just as I was agout to do so his foot
slipped and he straddled the log. Both his legs nearly up to
his hips were stuck in the tarry contents of the bayou.
\u25a0 "I assisted him out as best I could, and It vas then that
he declared that I had got him into the oil business head anu
ears. The next *5>pposttlon was to clean Mr. Rockefeller's
clothes sufficiently tor him to be presentable when he returned
to Titusville. I found an old barrel stave, and with this I
scraped him for nearly an hour. We ate dinner at Petroleum
Center, and after Mr. Rockefeller had further investigated Vie
oil interests we returned to Titusville. Before leaving for
Cleveland Rockefeller purchased a new suit of clothes."
This trip of Rockefeller to the Titusville district was one on
which he placed considerable stress. He thanked Mr. Breed
for the interest he had shown in bringing him to the oil fields
and expressed himself as greatly satisfied with his visit.
Rockefeller had never before even seen an oil derrick.
On Mr. Rockefeller's return to Cleveland he ordered his
first car of oil, which was shipped from the well in which Mr.
Breed was Interested.
Within the next few weeks Mr. Breed expects to call upon
Mr. Rockefeller, and together they will recall the day on which
they rode horseback to Petroleum Center.

THE ; 3yC-A.I2SrTE3^r^.3SrpE3 OF OTLJDttR.
ROCKEFELLER HAS UNEXPECTED
INITIATION INTO OIL BUSINESS
HEARST'S celebrated defense, appearing simul
taneously in his three newspapers, differing
only in the personalities it indulges and
grandiloquently addressed "to the American people,"
has beea on the market long enough to enable judg
ment of its effect.
After it appeared in New York, the American peo
ple stopped their subscriptions and refused to receive
his paper from the carriers when it was offered free.
They excluded it from their houses and places of
business. Then Hearst had his paper 'wrapped like
a parcel of merchandise and delivered by special mes
sengers. This plan failed. One of the American peo
ple in New York investigated the subject, and in a
public communication said: "They have prepared
thousands of copies done up in this manner to leave
at every house, store and office. Nearly every Ameri
can District Telegraph messenger office in the city
has one or more thousands so prepared, with orders
to distribute. This looks as. if the yellow was on its
last legs."
Ladies sent to other papers like letters to warn
mothers against this sinister plan to sneak Hearst's
paper into families of the American people. Clubs,
composed of the American people, excluded it from
their rooms and entered an order suspending for a
month any member who brought it within their
rooms or read it there. In the street cars ladies re
fused <o occupy seats "alongside of men who were
reading Hearst's papers, giving, their reasons to be
heard by all the passengers. In some cases the
readers .threw the sheet out of the window and apolo T
gized. In all cases thoy threw it, and were cheered by
the crowd of passengers.
In his proclamation to the American people Hearst
asked the question, who hate the Examiner, in Chi
cago the American, and in New York the Journal,
and answered it: "Those whom it has fought, and
those who have been hurt in the newspaper business
by a success which is at once a rebuke to incapacity
and in infuriating provocation to envy and jealousy."
Judged by their denunciations of Hearst and his
papers, he has "fought" a majority of the clergy of the
United States and the presidents of colleges and uni
versities. He has fought Archbishop Riordan of this
city, bishops and clergy of the Episcopal and Metho
dist churches, the pastors of all the churches governed
by the presbytery, and all the churches that have
congregational government, for they have joined in
expressing the hatred that good men feel for him and
his style of journalism. Then he has fought the G. A.
R., for its sentiments were expressed in a national
memorial which said of him "he is a Judas with the
addition of disguise and modern enterprise. His
seeds of murder, hate and anarchy, fructify into crimes
like the assassination of President McKinley." H(
has fought the thousands of club organizations anc
commercial bodies which have outlawed his papers
and the hundreds of thousands of men and womer
who join the Rev. George Francis Whittemore ir
baying: "Who for gain tempts men to crime, let hi:
name be anathema."
In his proclamation "to the American people'
Hearst announces that in the future, as. in the past, hi;
papers' will "be human and animated and entertain
ing" indulging "the light 'word and funny picture"
and" protests that is all he has done, and all that m^Ice:
people stop his paper, outlaw and exclude it, Tefusi
information to his unfortunate reporters;: and evei
order from their doorsteps district messenger boys
who try to deliver it wrapped up like linen from the
laundry. >*,
He is right- His idea of being human and enter
taining, and the light and funny^ picture, is in issue.
It was to be human and entertaining that, he used
these light words: "McKinley's is a dull brain. It is
a milk and water brain."â McKinley and his Wall
street Cabinet are ready to surrender every particle of
national honor and dignity." â "The people must de
cide between conservative remedies riQw, and desper
ate remedies later." â "The .world's achievements and
great changes have all come from discontent, and you
should be, in as many ways as possible, a breeder of
discontent among the human beings around you."â
"The time of dissolution is at hand. Twenty corpora
tions own the President and virtually - exercise the
functions .of government"â "So what we hear that
this republic is in danger how, just remember what a
thort time intervened between the King (of France),
alive and drinking, and the King dead, and the peas
ants'all eating." â "McKinley plays the coward and
shivers white-faced. He makes an internationalcur
of his country; he is an abject, weak, futile, incom
petent poltroon. He is, therefore, the most despised
and hated creature in the hemisphere."
These "light words," and "human and entertaining"
sentiments, were illustrated by Mr. Hearsf s idea, of
funny pictures, representing the President idiotically
applauding the starving and murder of the common
people, or as a negro minstrel," singing coon songs.
Really, Mr. Hearst is too human and entertaining in
his way and too funny after his idea for the American
people. They believe him to be a blackguard, an en
venomed pervert and degenerate, and his papers unfit
to enter, a decent family, club or place of .business.
That seems to be the only difference at present ex
isting between Hearst and the American people:

The mistake was rectified and another
watch set. Two suspicious strangers
were intercepted, but there was no evi
dence against them.
The. officers believe the blackmailer was
under the impression that he was after
Clarence Berry, the Klondike millionaire,
who has large Interests in this counts.
Major Berry professes not to feel nerv
ous over the affair, but he is anxious for
the officers to capture the letter-writer if
possible. . ..
Berry drew $1000 from the r bank, and,
as he was informed in the letter that he
was watched, pains were taken to carry
the money as publicly as possible to his
office. Here fifty silver dollars were sub
stituted for the gold, and in the evening
he drove to the place and deposited the
coin. Two deputies disguised as tramps
lay in the field near at hand to watch pro
ceedings. They failed to see any one ap
proach the spot during the night, and the
next day on rereading the letter Berry
found he had placed the sack in the
wrong, place.
At first Berry believed It was a hoax,
but on reading it over he decided to give
the letter t6 the District Attorney. The
latter, taking a deputy from the Sheriff's
office into his confidence, decided to lay a
trap for the blackmailer.

The carnival opened brilliantly, . giving
promise of fine entertainment throughout
the week. The purpose of the carnival
is to raise funds for a home for the Wo
men's Educational and Industrial .Union,
of which Madame Sorbier is the president.
The home assists \u25a0women to learn trades
and occupations by which they may earn
a living. The present accommodations
are insufficient and the rent is a tax upon
the income from which the managers
wish to be freed. . ' - \u25a0- \. - â
TRENTON, N. J., Sept. 30.â Joe Gans
of Baltimore to-night at the Trenton Ath
letic Club knocked out Jimmy Handler
of Newark in the first round of .what
was to have been a twenty-round bout.
In two minutes Handler was knocked
down four times by the colored man.
Handler opened with jabs and short
leads, but Gans easily evaded them. Gans
then rushed and as he did so he hooked
Handler with left to the jaw and dropped
him. Handler arose, but sparred wildly
and was again put down. He was very
groggy and barely able to defend him
self and down he went again with" a
short swing on the chin.. He arose
quickly, when Gans rushed and planted
his left cleanly on the jaw, sending
Handler down again. Handler got to his
knees and staggered toward the ropes
when he toppled over and was counted
cut. (>

September 22, was arrested at Winlock
last night and brought to Kalama by
Sheriff Huntington this morning. He is
now i^ged in the Cowiitz County JaiL
The crime for which Goe was arrested
was committed at Hammerson's hop
yards at Olequa. There was no direct
evidence against Goe and the circum
stantial evidence was very meager, but
Goe removed all question as to his guilt
by making a full confession.
Edward Mclntyre and Thomas Joy were
passing Goe's quarte.-s at the hop yards
when Goe's dog ran out and Mclntyre
said: "Shoot him." Joy drew his revolver,
and, as he says, shot in the air. Goe,
hearing the remark and the pistol shot,
jumped out of bed and fired two shots at
Mclntyre and Joy, one shof striking Mc
lntyre in the back and causing his death
in a few hours.

FRESNO, Sept. 30.â The low price for
raisins â less than three cents in the sweat
boxâ quoted by the directors of the Cali
fornia Raisin Growers' Association, has
e>. asperated the anti-Kearney element and
many Kearneyites and a call for a mass
mreting of growers, to be held on Octo
ber 2, has been issued by a committee of
raisin men. The circular terms the low
ligure quoted a violation of the contract
under which the association claims con
trol of the crop. It calls upon growers
to postpone delivery of raisins until ac
tion can be taken to enforce fulfillment of
â¢the association's side of the contract.
The consensus of opinion among the
rxÂ«lsin men is that 4 cents would be a fair
competitive price and that this figure
covld be obtained if there were no associa
tion. It is believed that a majority of
the association's members will refuse to
deliver their raisins and will combine to
resist suits if they be commenced.
President Kearney, speaking for- the
directors, in reply to a demand that they
resign, says to the growers:
"11 you will sign the leases we will
ClEc"ly resign. If that is your desire, for
we feel that the signing of the leases
guarantees to all the success of the associ
ation and higher prices for raisins for
three years."
He follows this with a lengthy defense
of the directors' action.

Larone is now at the camp recuperat
ing. He believes he could not possibly
have survived anotner day.
Larone was revived enough to tell his
story to-day. 'He left Vancouver early in
August,.' He had been drinking -much,
and his friends were not far wrong -when
they -feared he had wandered off in a fit
of delirium." For days the loggers at the
Mclntyre camp searched for him, but
without result. * He says he walked for
days. â¢ He ate berries and bark and just
managed.' to keep alive. The pangs of
hunger wore off the influence of the
liquor, and he. had a sense of the danger
of death, but he could do nothing but
crawl along. He lost flesh rapidly, and
each day he feared that the -succeeding
one would be his last. For an entire
month he struggled for life. He tried to
catch fish out of the brooks, and was
forced to eat toads and small reptiles that
he could easily catch. -
After thirty-five days of wandering, La
rone caught a porcupine, and the eating
of it undoubtedly saved his life. For
four days he lived on the raw meat and
gathered a little fresh strength. Fortu
nately he did not meet any wild animals,
arid there was little to break the mo
notony. It was four days after he heard
the engine whistle at the bay before he
was able to reach the track. He crawled
most of the way on his hands and knees,
for he staggered and fell heavily if he
attempted to walk. He dragged himself
near the railway line and waited, and
later was picked up.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept 3O.-With
only a flickering spark of life left in a
frame wasted by forty-six days of con
tinuous hunger, Fred Larore, a mining
man well known here, returned to Van
couver to-day.
Since August II, Larone has been lost in
the woods. His experience was a horrible
one. There are days of which he remem
bers practically nothing, and the period
of his starvation is like* one -continuous
nightmare. Too feeble to stand, wan and
pale of face and absolutely helpless, La
rone was picked up by the loggers at
Wulffsohn Bay and brought into camp.
Men who knew- Larone two months ago,
when he weighed 210 pounds and was a
finely built man, do not recognize him
now in the slender, shriveled being who
weighs barely. 140, and who has appar
ently-passed through -the valley of the
shadow of death. - - â¢

THE WEEKLY CALL.
$1 per Year. |Dimmick's Trial Set.
The trial of "Walter N. Dimmlck on
two indictments charging him with em
bezzling Government money from the
San Francisco Mint was set by United
States District Judge de Haven yester
day for October 8.
Examinations for teachers will be con
ducted on Saturday at the Girls' High
School and at the same place in the lat
ter part of December. All who applied
before are eligible to take either or both
of the examinations, the fact that they
were not selected in the first instance
being no bar to attempts in the future
to secure positions.
After nearly two years of waiting the
Board of Education yesterday afternoon
elected the first batch of new teachers
to the department. There were twenty
seven selected on the "preferential and
allotment" system. Mrs. Kincaid, presi
dent of the board, was In the chair
promptly at 2:30 o'clock, Directors Den
man and Mark were in their offices, but
Director Casserly, who had been seen
around the board rooms previous to the
hour of meeting, was nowhere in evi
dence.
After an hour he returned and the
board, accompanied by a large pair of
shears, adjourned to an anteroom, where
the prepared list of names was divided.
On the return to the meeting-room Di
rector Denman explained the plan that
had been adopted. From, the 157 appli
cants who had submitted their names
twenty-seven had been selected. These
were divided into two classes, known as
"experience'.' and "training school."
Seventeen were in the first- class and ten
in the second.
Superintendent Webster conducted the
lottery, his hat being the ' wheel from
which the prize of "order of preference"
was drawn, the result being as follows:
Elizabeth B. Moore, Cecilia M. Gllchrist,
Dorothy Vogelsang, Clare E. Rodgers, May E.
A. Gray, Kathryn H. Daly. Mollie McLaren,
Lois Angeline Peckham, Annie Whitley, Agnes
McDonald, Kernan Robson, Anna Dwyer,

Adelaide M. Cobb, Emma L. Noonan, Edith
S. Humphrey, Elvtna Berard. Marie F. d'Or.
Maude Schendel, Helen M. Hogan, Margaret
A. Noon, May T. Gaffney, Anna G. Brittain.
As a number of these teachers are out
of the city at present all were instructed
to report for duty not later than Monday,
October 14, at 8:30 a. m. As they report
they will be assigned to the substitute
list and as vacancies occur will be placed
on the eligible list. From this they will
be assigned to positions under a two
years' probation before being finally
elected to the department.

missioner Powderly to allow Fel Chi and
Hung Hfeiang Hal, Chinese students, to
remain here until they can procure cer
tificates from China, as required by the
exclusion act. The applicants are stu
dents on their way to Oberlin College.
They came to this city with a passport
signed by Li Hung Chang, but Collector
Stratton decided that a passport even
from the Empress Dowager would be of
no value, because the act requires a cer
tificate, not a passport.
Li Hung Chang's Proteges Must Pro
cure the Certificates Required*
by Exclusion Act.
PASSPORTS NOT GOOD

ptr month. Mayor Phelan said that the

ject to the approval of the Finance Com

_ S2S Market at.. S. F.â (Send for Circulars >A man supposed to be M. H. Allen, who
passed a 'number of forged checks in
Kansas City, Mo., two weeks ago, was
arrested in this city this morning. Chief
of Police Hayes of Kansas City was in
structed that Allen is in custody and
Detective Jarboe started yesterday ,for
this city to take the prisoner back. After
Allen left Kansas City his trail was
picked up at East Leavenworth,' Kans.
He went from there to Denver, Salt Lake
City and finally, it is believed, arrived in
this city.
Allen's last deal in Kansas City was
with a Mr. Williamson, a ticket broker,
from whom he purchased a ticket to Chi
cago for $11. In payment he gave a cer
tified check for $25 on the Consolidated
Tobacco Company of Plttsburg, Kans.,
and received $14 in change.
Brown had a similar experience, and a
score of others have suffered small losses

\V and' is 1 the owner of a valuable field
dog. The animal' has won many prizes and
is a great pet. On Thursday last Wand
visited the training quarters of George
Gardner and on the return journey the
dog gave chase to a rabbit and was soon
lost to view. Wand searched for an hour,
but without success. He returned home
sorely disappointed. 'As the dog did not
materialize the- next day Mr. Wand
inserted an advertisement in The Call.
The. morning the issue containing the ad
vertisement came out the stranger called
on Wand and told him he knew where the
dog could be found. He said a friend of
his who. lived in Santa Clara County had
found the animal and was waiting to dis
cover its owner. Wand was overjoyed
and willingly gave the fellow |2 to pay
his railway fare and $2 more with which
to buy refreshments for himself and
friend. He told the fellow if he brought
the dog to the Olympic Club he would
hand over the reward. The stranger
agreed to everything asked, took the
money and departed. Wand is still waiting
for him to return. The dog returned to
Wand the next day. It was picked up In
the park and as soon as it regained its
liberty trotted home.
The police of this city are looking for a
clever swindler who is practicing a
scheme that is not only enriching him
self but causing good citizens many, dis
appointments. This unscrupulous fellow
rises early and eagerly scans the lost and
found columns of the various papers and
then pays a visit to the home of the ad
vertiser. If the party has lost a dog or
anything of value the faker glibly tells
him that he knows the party who found
it. He always places the finder's residence
outside the county and in- this way gets
a dollar or two to reach the place. Some
times he collects the reward and promises
to redeem ane lost animal or, article, but
he is never seen again. Many -complaints
have been made against him,. but as yet
he has not been apprehended. . \u25a0 : \u25a0
.. Among those who have been mulcted by
the scoundrel are Phil Wand, the well
known Olympic Club athlete; P. D. Lin
ville, Tommy Howard and William B.
Brown, steward* of the Cafe Zinkand.
Wand's experience was the most costly
and the manner In which he was taken in
by the glib stranger may ; be a lesson to
others. '

Dr. Condict, in speaking of the Filipinos
and the possibility of their development
into good American citizens, said that
what they needed was teaching rather
than shooting. She spoke of the work
which has been accomplished by the Y.
M. C. A., and also by the American Bible
Society. She advocated a more liberal
circulation of the Bible among the people
of the islands.
Dr. Alice B. Condict delivered an inter
esting and instructive lecture on the
Philippines last night in the auditorium
of the Y. M. C. A. building. The lecture
was appropriately illustrated with views
of the beautiful scenery on the islands,
of the historical monasteries and Govern
ment buildings and of the people them
selves. In their picturesque modes of life.
The views, which may well be classed as
\u25a0works of art, were made in Japan. They
were greatly enjoyed by the- audience.
Especially was this true of the scene rep
resenting the Y. M. C. A. headquarters
at Manila.

and to the new Chief of the nation; and by
admission of the correspondent of the Associat
ed Press, the most beautiful floral piece that
adorned the bier of the dead Chief Executive
in Canton was the one which bore the Italian
colors and the name of the King of Italy. Be
eides this the Italian newspapers unanimously
denounced the awful crime at Buffalo, uttering
most bitter words against anarchism.
We shall never forget the high compliment
paid to the Italians by the late President, and
as a token of homage to the memory of the
great dead we are going to open in the col
umns of our paper a subscription to contribute
to the fund that the committee of which you
are chairman is raising for the erection of a
monument to William HcKinley. The money
received through our paper will be turned over
to the treasurer of your committee.
Dear Sir: When President McKinley paid a
visit to our city last May, to one of the editors
til the Uaily ritalia who went to greet him
In the namÂ« of the Italian colony, the beloved
Chief of the nation said:
"I accept very heartily the salute of tha
Xt&Hane. whom I know are among the best
and most loyal citizens of this cosmopolitan
country-"
Mayor Phelan, chairman of the com
mittee having in charge the raising of
funds for the McKinley monument, re
cti\ed a letter yesterday stating that the
Italians felt deep sorrow for the untimely
oeath of the beloved President of the
United States and that "L' Italia" In
tends to open its columns for subscrip
tions toward the erection of the McKinley
monument. The letter reads as follows:
President Castro recognizes the discon
tent existing and is taking measures to
meet whatever revolutionary exigencies
may arise.
COLON, Sept. 30, "via Galveston.âAr
rivals here from the coast bring no news
from Rio Hacha, but they confirm the
news previously cabled of the complete
defeat of the Venezuelan invaders at the
peninsula of Guajira by Colombian troops,
unassisted by "Venezuelan invaders.
Several guns, some mitrailleuses and
rifles and a large quantity of ammunition
were captured. After this defeat the In
dians who inhabited Guajira captured the
returning Venezuelans, among the pris
oners being three Venezuelan rebel chiefs.
The invaders lost many men killed. Gen
eral Orbis, who formerly served under
General Alban, â 'Â«= also killed.
A rupture between Colombia and Ven
ezuela would give the revolutionary ele
ment the desired chance to attack the
Government.
The feeling of the country against
President Castro is growing stronger
every day. The country's discontent at
General Castro's dictatorship is evidenced
by many comparatively insignificant
signs, but they plainly foretell a growing
revolution.
Strong Feeling Against Castro.
CARACAS, Venezuela, Monda.y, Sept.
23 (via Willemstad, Island of Curacao,
Thursday, Sept. 26, and via Colon, Colom
bia, Sept. 29).â The financial condition of
Venezuela is best exemplified by the fact
that the republic has not paid interest
on its foreign or internal indebtedness for
the past thirty-eight months. Only two
or three importing houses at Caracas are
paying expenses. Business is practically
limited to needed foodstuffs and many
import orders have been countermanded.
Extreme lack of confidence prevails in
business circles and the immediate future
contains nothing promising. The expecta
tion is general that the financial situation
will become worse before it can improve.
The war rumors have decreased imports
and the Government is getting into more
severe straits to find money, to meet the
extraordinary expense incident to main
taining the army on the frontier. Among
the people, the suffering from the hard
times is great. The salaries of all the
Government civil employes have been cut
in half, but even this is not now paid.
Since the reverses at Guajlra the Gov
ernment has been transferring- its atten
tion to the San Cristobal country, south
of Maracaibo, and is sending arms, men
and 150,000 rounds of ammunition from
Caracas to Barquesimeto, where the in
terior forces are converging.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 3O.-Dr. Silva, the
Colombian Minister, to-day received a per
sonal message from Bogota announcing
a Cabinet crisis there. The dispatch
came from his brother-in-law, Michael
Abedia Mendez, who announced that the
crisis had resulted in his appointment as
Minister of Foreign Affairs. The belief
prevails that the change was precipitated
by differences among the Cabinet on ac
count of the gold loan which the Govern
ment has been seeking from the banks.
Some of the Ministers were favorable to
compulsory action In forcing a loan, while
others were opposed to such a course. A
gold loan was necessary- in order to get
money to purchase ships and for other
purposes.

ISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1901.
"He called me a 'common swindler. It's
pretty hard for a man who has worked as
hard as I have to be original to be re
ferred to as 'common.' "âWashington
Star.
"I shall sue him for libel,", said the man
who is making large sums of money out
of the credulity of the masses.
"For what?" .
Harry Tremble, Attilio Bonacuro and
Joseph Lawlor, who are well known to
the police, were held to answer before
the Superior Court by Judge Conlan yes
terday on a charge of attempt to com
mit robbery. Their bonds were fixed at
51000 each. They attacked N. D. McAfee
in Portsmouth Square a few nights ago
and attempted to rob him- "
Held for Attempt to Bob.
Detective Ed Gibson swore to a warrant
yesterday for the arrest of Liouie Fong,
who is accused of having shot and killed
Bo Yook, the pretty Chinese girl, last
Friday morning while she was sitting at
the casement of her home at 1025 Dupont
street. Fong has not been seen in his us
ual haunts since the murder. He was for
merly errtployed as the attendant at a
lunch counter in a Kearny-street saloon.
Warrant for Alleged Murderer.
A few hours later he called at the main
office, 1038 Union avenue, And said his
train had just left and the ticket wa3
worthless to him. An offer was made to
buy the ticket back, and Allen agreed, to
accept $8 for It, which was paid. He was
therefore $22 ahead on a forged check for
$25." .,".-.
Before this transaction Allen secured
several hundred dollars from merchants
in Kansas City by making ' purchases
which he paid for in - forged certified
checks, receiving the change in cash. Al
len ' is * wanted at Omaha \u25a0 for an I offense
similar to that committed in Kansas Gity,
and it is said that he is wanted in a num
ber of cities in Missouri and Illinois for
forgery. In each case he forged the name
of the Consolidated Tobacco Company. .
Tne suspect is in the "tanks", of the
City Prison and Captain Seymour says he
is about 25 years of age. The police are
not wholly satisfied that he is the man
wanted. He denies that his name is Allen
or that he was ever in Kansas City.

Mrs. L. A. Harris, a Prominent Member
of a Chicago Woman's Political Club, tells
how Ovariart Troubles may be Cured with-
out a Surgical Operation. She says:
'\u25a0" Doctors have a perfect craze for. operations. The minute
there is any trouble, nothing. but an operation will do them; one
hundred dollars and costs, and included in the costs are pain, and
agony, and often death.
:> *' I suffered for eight years with ovarian troubles ; spent hundreds
of dollars for relief, until two doctors agreed that an operation was
my only chance of life. My sister had been using !LydiaC Pink*
ham's Vegetable Compound for her troubles, and been cured,
and she strongly urged me to let the doctors go and try the Com-
pound. I did so as a last resort; used it faithfully with the Sana-

Pinkham's Vegetable Compound at once removes such troubles.
BATLWAY TRAVEL.
104.6 Miles
In 27I Hours
There are two things you will always remember
if you go East via Denver and the Burlington
Route. One is the scenery in Colorado. The
other is ".the whirlwind ride across Nebraska,
Iowa and Illinois aboard the Chicago Special â
the Burlington's famous "one nigh.t on the road"
train from Denver to Chicago. It makes the
run of ,1 046 miles in 275^ hours; carries a through
sleeper for Chicago, which leaves San Francisco
daily and offers as good service as any
PflfjppfpPj] train in the world.

Mall advices from New Tork say:
Nuts, Fruits and Currants.
"The naming of prices of new California
â¢walnuts on the basis of 9Hc f. o. b., coast, for
No. 1 solftshell was the feature yesterday.
Prices on other trades were 9c for standard
and 7*>&c for No. 2, both softshell and standard.
A few cars were sold to a certain trade, but
at the quotations the California article can
scarcely compete to any extent . in the local
market acainst the imported walnut. New
Grenobles can be laid down here at about 10c
and importers are reselling to the trade at
lrom 10*c to lO^c for middle of November de
liver}'. As against these prices California No.
1 softshell could not be laid down under 10%c.
The California Droduct. therefore, will neces
earily bave to find Its market largely in the
West- New England always takes a consider
able quantity of domestic walnuts also, and
advices received yesterday stated that con
firmations were belner made at Boston quite
*rÂ«ely.
â¢\u25a0Currants on spot continue quiet and easy.
Supplies of new cron were Increased by 400
barrels, arrived per Georgian from Liverpool.
Some of these goods offer, it Is understood, at
7"*c. Demand for spot currants, however, con
tinues very slow, the trade's interest centering
in the 2500 tons, or about 1S.0O0 barrels, expect
ed to arrive to-day or to-morrow on the Ma
nin. the first direct steamer from Greece. Ama
lias per this vessel are mostly held at 6V4C.
though"%c and possibly lie less might buy. A
bid of 6c for a round lot was turned down
yesterday by one receiver, however. There
was an improved inquiry for currants both
on the Manin and the Melville. The latter
steamer sailed from Patras on September 7 and
brings about 1750 tons, or approximately 12,500
barrels.
New Smyrna figs are practically â¢ un
changed at 8%@12c for layers. Something
over 100 cases, which arrived last week per
Teutonic, were offered at auction yesterday,
but on account of the warm weather and pos
sibly other reasons, very little interest was
taken in the goods, and after a few cases had
been 6old from 7%c to lO^ic the balance of the
lot -was \u25a0withdrawn. The prices at the auction
had almost no effect on the market, sales ex
utore being made Just after the sale at 8%@12c.
"California fruits, spot and future, continued
dull. St>ot 3-crown loose Muscatel raisins are
Ecarce and firmer. Evaporated apples on spot
are very quiet and easy. F*uture prime apples,
which were stronger for a few days, have
again become easy, being offered freely at 8%c,
with sÂ£c less bid."

of the trading to-day and the tendency ' of
pricea to retrace the earlier downward move
ment revealed the predominance of protessional
operations in . the market. The dealings weru
less than half a million shares and uie - late
hardening movement retrieved approximately
one-half of tne early decline. Tnere: was >-no
very urgent selling manifest at any point of
the day. although the bears succeeded : in un
covering stop-loss' orders in Sugar and 'to' a
smaller extent in Brooklyn Transit and Mis
souri PaclHc. The first named stock fell an ex
treme 3% and the other two 3 points. Declines'
reached 2 points or over in a number of other
leading stocks, notably among the Pacifies,
Southwesterns and Vanderbilts. Declines of i
to 4% among the Junior members of the last
named group gave emphasis to the feeling
of skepticism that has grown up regarding
the much exploited rumors of a plan for merg
ing all the members of the group. Amalga
mated Copper continued under some pressure,
but the declines were resisted. The lirar tone'
of the spot copper market in London helped -the'
stock and It closed with a net loss of 1%. As
sertions were made in a demonstrative way
that the United States Steel stocks were to be
advanced this week on the ground of the decla-
ration to be made to-morrow, of .. the
dividends on the common and the preferred
stocks and on the presentation of a detailed
statement of the finances -of -the company at
to-morrow's meeting, but these intimations did
not cause a rush to buy the stocks, speculat
ors persisting in distrust of " industrial stocks
after the recent experience in Amalgamated
Copper. > .
Statements that working agreements had
been made for the . continuance of Western
Union wires along some railroads In which
Pennsylvania owns an interest were offered as
disapproving apprehension of hostilities be
tween the Pennsylvania and the Gould inter
ests. The admission of an- additional Standard
Oil representative in the St. Paul directory led
to prophecies of a similar representation on the
Union Pacific directory and the alleged com
pletion of negotiations between the Atchison
and the Harriman interests â¢for the use of the
Pacific Mail steamships by the Atchison were
used to point the same inference, namely: the
safety of the community of interest. Except
for a rise In Pacific Mail no effect was pro
duced by these reports; the apprehension hov
ering over the market that community of in
terest is not in reality in concert with the finan
cial powers, but only a balance of those pow
ers. The October currency requirement kept
uneasiness alive regarding the money market
future, seemingly with little cause, as Sterling
Exchange weakened to-day and New York Ex
change hardened at Chicago. The sub-treasury
paid out to-day on account of gold deposited at
Pacific Coast points $1,944,774, and for Govern
ment bond redemptions $1,250,000. The incom
ing- French steamer also brought the $1,000 000
in gold which was engaged, in PaVis over a
week ago. The fact that railroad earnings for
tne third week in September increased over the
corresponding week of last year 4.46 per cent
compared with an increase for the second week
of 1L.2 per cent was cited as evidence that
the corn crop shortage was beginning to make
an impression, and last week's small grain re
ceipts at Chicago formed an additional argu
ment for the bears.

London Market. â¢"'
NEW YORK, Sept 30.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram- says:
The stock market to-day was listless and un
easy over a fresh relapse in the copper shares,
attributable to nervousness about the Paris set
tlement, where a heavy 'loss is* entailed by the
break in coppers and In -Russian industrial en
terprises.. Rio Tintos opened at' 46%; fell to
45% and closed at 46%; Anaconda touched 7U,
and closed at 7%. The authorities favor the
theory that the slump in Amalgamated is all
a stock market dodgre. *
American shares opened under parity and
held quiet and steady until New York came
as a buyer of United States Steel, which Mor
gan brokers bought freely. The list otherwise
was neglected and the closing was dull.
The Bank of England has bought- Â£15,000
gold in Australia.
The market, despite the fact we are at the
end of the quarter, is beginning to repay the
bank, but Â£2,000,000 is due to-morrow.
The exchange will be closed to-morrow.

Wilfred Clarke and his supporting com
pany present the funniest sketch seen in
this city for manya day at^the Orpheum.
Last night a packed house roared at the
humerous situations and unusually good
stage business offered. The sketch must
needs be seen to be appreciated. Madge
Fox, direct from New York, where i for
six months she has turned theater-goers
upside down at one particular roof gar
den, combines coon-song shouting with
acrobatic "stunts" extraordinary in the
extreme. Boyce and Wilson are amusing
song and dance men. indulging in abso
lute crazyisms. Arnold Grazer and
Blanche Trelease, the cleverest children
before the public, give a wonderful sing-
Ing and dancing turn, combined with
their "Mysterious Mirrors." Press Eld
ridge unloaded an avalanche of fun at the
audience, Dorothy Morton sang new
songs and the Svengalis continued to
mystify. The Parros brothers, than whom
no better acrobats ever visited San Fran
cisco, and the biograph, with moving pic
tures of the late President's funeral,
complete an. excellent programme.
Orpheum.
Alice de Leon, a French chanteuse,
made a tremendous hit at Fischer's Con
cert House last night, as did also the pan
tomime, '.'A Druggist's Troubles," pre
sented by the Razlllia company. Richards
and Relyea, original "Roman ring" ar
tists, created an acrobatic sensation and
Agnes George, a child soubrette; Robert
Nome, saxophone soloist, and Sam Holds
worth, tenor, completed an excellent pro
gramme.. The house was packed.
Fischer's Concert House.
A large audience enjoyed the new bill
at the Chutes last night. Mile. Lotty
scored a big hit with her beautiful poses.
Carter Bros, are clever acrobats and do
many new and daring feats. Deets and
Don continue to be great favorites with
their novel singing and dancing act. Other
good number are the Carlson sisters,
Valkyra, equilibrist, Berlin sisters in
new songs~anfl a series of new moving
pictures. Including scenes of McKinley at
the Buffalo Exposition.

A capacity testing house demonstrated
approval of the double bill offered at the
Tivoli last night. "Cavalleria" and
"I Pagliacci"' have become favorite operas
at this house, and the rendition was fully
up to the standard of excellence estab
lished. In the first named opera Agottlnl
as Turiddu was pplendid. His ringing
tenor, always perfect in intonation,
brought out the full beauty of the score,
and his acting of the part of the recreant
lover of Santuzza showed the true dram
atic itxstinct. His drinking cup song was
tumultuously redemanded. Barbarescnl
â¢was Eantuzza. and her voice answered all
the requirements of the trying role. Her
scene with the tenor was strong and her
perfect type of the Italian face made her
the Sicilian girl to the life. Ferrari sang
Alno acceptably, and Pollettini was the
first real Lola the Tivoli has given us.
Miss Boston was fair as Lucia. The inter
mezzo, though heard numberless times,
tailed forth an encore. Salassa. opened
the performance of "I Pagliacci" with .his
magnificent singing of the prologue, and
the great Impression he made last year
was duplicated. His acting of the role
of the revengeful clown equals his Iago
or Nabucco. Montanarl as Nedda ap
peared for the first time in some weeks
and was warmly w'elcomed. Castellano as
the deceived Canlo was in good voice, his
brilliztit upper tones being particularly
telling. Pollettini sang the serenade well,
and Zani's Silvio was a good i>erfornuuice.
The orchestral direction of Steindorff was
never better, the choruses going with fine
precision. "Carmen" Is the bill to-night.
This week Is the last of the Bizet opera.

But the tables were turned the next day
when Mrs. Mitchell had Mrs. Still arrest
ed for battery. The case was tried In the
Justice Court and attracted the entire
population of the Livermore Valley as
the contestants are well known;, Mrs.
Mitchell had no trouble proving her case
to the satisfaction of Justice Taylor, who
sentenced Mrs. Still to serve twenty days
in jail. \u25a0 ~
All the. parties to this story of 9n um
brella and a broken head live in the town
of Livermore. The Stills and the Mitch
ells have been neighbors for a long time
and until lately they were on friendly
terms. But one day the neighbors had a
falling out over some trivial thing, with
the result that they have been cherishing
an aversion for each other. The breach
was widened by the gossip of .other peo
ple.
: The other night Mrs. Still laid. In wait
for Mrs. Mitchell behind a woodpile, a
bale of hay or something that was not
transparent and when the rival appeared
began a fusillade of blows upon her head
with an umbrella which she brought
along for the purpose. Mrs. Still bela
bored so hard that she broke the weapon,
after which she used her fists to advan
tage. Mrs. Mitchell, being taken wholly
unawares, was compelled to submit to the
abuse until her assailant grew tired", when
she 1 made her \u25a0way home. .
For being unduly free with her umbrella
Mrs. Annie E. Still of Livermore Is_ serv
ing a sentence of- twenty . days in the
County Jail. Mrs. Still is accused of al
most fracturing Mrs. Cora Mitchell's
frontal bone with her deadly weapon and
making it very unpleasant for the victim
all around.

When the case went on this afternoon
after a recess since Friday, on account
of the Illness of Attorney Snook, the
talesmen were examined in quick succes
sion and at the end of two hours the de
fense announced that it was satisfied with
Thomas White, the last man examined.
A short conference was then held,' after
which it was announced that, the case
woMTd be continued until to-morrow
morning. " \u25a0 . ;-.,.-\u25a0\u25a0:
Over and over again the attorneys have
told thft story of Adams' crime to the
: men on the panel by putting hypothetical
questions, of course, and the prejudices
of the possible Jurymen against the in
sanity and self-defense pleas have been
inquired Into exhaustively. "Altogether
fifty-one men "were examined, some
among them having been summoned as
special veniremen on account of the ex
haustion of the regular panel. Of these
nineteen were dismissed by the defense,
nine by the people and eleven by ..ie
court. The defense and prosecution went
â¢almost to the limit of the peremptory
challenges -which are allowed them,, the
former being given twenty and, the latter
ten. . \u25a0 â¢\u25a0"'.'
To-morrow morning at . 10 o'clock
Charles G. Adams, who killed John G.
Jessup, will face the jury that is to try
him and which was completed this after
noon. After a struggle that has extended
over five days the attorneys for the peo
ple and the defense succeeded to-day in
getting the last of the necessary twelve
men. They are: L. Linekin, C. B. White,
John Madden, P. Qulnlan, J. McGlvney,
P. J. Delehanty, N. G. Stiirtevant, M. J.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Sept. 30.
I am satisfied now that I did. wrong In pre
tending: that I was held up and robbed, . but
I couldn't help it at the time. I was driven
to it by persons to whom I owed money and
who would give me no rest. Saturday I went
to San Francisco to collect on a note that was
due me and to try and secure money from other
people owing me. When I started for home I
did not have enough bv $200 to meet ' what 1
had to pay. I knew that some of my creditors,
who wert not as deserving to.be paid as oth
ers I owe, would be at the house. Kather than
disappoint my .generous creditors, who should
have their money as soon j as any ono \u25a0 else,
I decided to meet a fictitious highwayman and
be robbed. I intended to leave the money hid
den away until I obtained sufficient to pay
every onel owed. â¢â¢--. \u25a0 , .
The statement that" I told the story of the
hold-up for the purpose of deceiving jny cred
itors is false. I mean to pay every cent I owe
and always meant to do so. I have been so
worked up over money troubles ( that I have
hardly slept during the past week. I Intended
to give up a contract on a house I am building
since this thing \u25a0 happened, but many friends
have come to me and offered to assist me. The
Woodmen In particular - have been friends in
need and friends in deed. I wlll;square up all
my debts if given time.
W. V. Lillie, the Berkeley contractor
who on Saturday night claimed that he
was held up near the High School and
relieved of $700 and who admitted to' the
police yesterday that the alleged robbery
was a fiction of his own Imagination, Is
now sorry that he was the sole party to
the deception. Lillie feels that his strange
action has harmed his name, but he as
serts that he was so worried over finan
cial matters and nagged by persistent
creditors that he could think of no other
way to cause them to ease up for a while
than,J.o resort to the footpad method.
After thinking the matter over he con
cluded to confess his scheme to the po
lice yesterday and. make a clean breast
of the whole strange affair. He said:

With the Feminine

Joseph Haworth with iconoclastic hand
has .pulled down and broken all the ideals
of days gone by in the Interpretation of
Shylock In "The Merchant of Venice." He
gives us a usurer of mild and even gentle
manners, albeit of grim and ferocious
speech and a purpose satanic In Its lust
for revenge. We miss the cyclone of
furious hate, the softl tearing passion dl
the Shylock we used to know and at
whom the gallery delighted to hiss and
hoot In Its frank democracy. 'Tis a re
pulsive character at best, one that Shake
speare drew with unsparing hand, after
he . had escaped from one of those
"uncles" who did business with the un
fortunate in his time. But Shylock's
desire for revenge smothers his avarice,
and hate is the keynote of his being. Mr.
Haworth in the character walks the stage
as sedately as a philosopher and speaks
the lines as well and precisely as if he
were a professor of elocution. But the
savage lust of the usurer for the blood
of the bankrupt only smolders; there is a
break here and there in the lava,' an
escape of hot steam and a few sparks,
and that Is all to tell of the volcanic fire
beneath. The star's performance of the
Jew, however, gives promise of a good
Hamlet next week, a character more In
accord with the actor's personality.
Butler, Mayall and Bernard are good sup
port as Antonio, Bassanio and Gratiano,
respectively. \u25a0: Adele Bel&rade, a trine
feminine for Portia, and Mabel Heritage,
a sweet but rather insipid Jessica, con
stitute the remainder of the cast.
Grand Opera-House.
"Kidnaped" in Its initial appearance
at the Central last night was greeted
with a crowded house and constantly re
curring applause. The play is rather
more realistic, if possible, than the ordi
nary melodrama, and is excellently ren
dered by the company.
Willard Blackmore, the hero of the
play, in the character of a German dude
seemed to be the favorite with the au
dience. Jennie Wiedman was the next in
line for honors, and Margaret 1 Marshall
and James Corrigan created no end of
amusement in their characterization of
an Irish couple. Frank Fanning, the vil
lain,* was hissed in a manner which
showed that he .played his part to the
entire satisfaction of the spectators Ed
win Emery and Annette Marshall were
also received vociferously. The minor
parts were also well carried out and the
play as a whole is admirably balanced.
In view of last night's success, it seems
probable that the performance will have
more than an ordinarily good run.
Central.
OAKLAND, Sept. 30.â The attorneys
engaged in the mandamus suit of the
Contra Costa Water Company against
City Auditor Breed presented arguments
before Judge Ellsworth to-day and when
the sessioti came to a close the case was
continued to Thursday for further argu
ment.
Attorney Guy C. Earl, for the Auditor,
devoted most of his remarks to. his con
tention that the water company has for
feited Its franchise because it did not
conform to a law which says that water
rates must be fixed by ordinance and
not by resolution.
Replying, Attorney McCutchen. - for
the water company, insisted that the pen
alty for -the disobedience of the letter
of the law Is absurd. He said that the
company might easily be deprived of Its
property without due process of law if
the law was enforced and probably
through no fault of the corporation. At
torney Knight followed McCutchen \u25a0 for
the company but did not finish.

She has a charming personality and her
acting is finely shaded. She carried the
audience with her in the part of Blanche
Chilworth, which she played with rare
tenderness and expression. Miss Carrie
Lamont as Amy, her sister, was warmly
received, as she was the winsome, lovable
girl to the life. She has a sweet, clear
voice and winning -ways. Dana Tracy, the
new juvenile, did not have any oppor
tunity of proving what he is capable of
doing in the part of Robert Binks, the
shop boy. Of the old" members of the
company Frank Bacon did a very clever
piece of character work as Todman, the
old bookseller, and Howard Scott was
almost as good as Brlginshaw, the vulgar
tradesman. The other parts were credit
ably filled by Paul Gerson, Barton Hill,
Walter Belasco, Carlyle Moore, Marie
Howe and Agnes Ranken. There should
be crowded houses during the week.
amusing adventures among the English
aristocracy, form the basis of the story,
\u25a0worked out with a rich and racy humor
by Owen Hall, who has had more Amer
ican millionaires than Astor in London to
draw from.
The part of Gilfain is well taken by W.
T. Carleton. who makes his appearance
here after too long an absence. He looks
the- planter excellently, sings his songs
in a sweet, though not strong voice, and
fill? all other requirements of the role.
The prettiest thing in the play is Miss
Grtce Dudley, a delicate and dainty little
lady who takes the Lady Holyrood part.
She dances like a fairy, as the children
say. and has snap, air. vim enough to
ecyply the crowd. She is everything she
should be, this chic and piquant littie
damsel, pretty as a picture, too. but she
can't sing, any more than can Miss Mil
lard, who is the Dolores of the cast. Miss
-.lillard wears the only tights in the
\u25a0\u25a0Florodora" crowd to admiration, and
looks just the petulant Tivoli cherub we
all remember, but she has not yet learned
how to sing. Frances Gordon is another
pretty maiden, and is charming as Angela
GMfain.
Sir. Bowers, as Frank Abercord. was
very pleasing, and has a smooth and
fweet voice that appears in "Under the
Palms" to best advantage, Philip Ryiey
is the comedian, and a beautifully un
earthly figure he is as Anthony Tweedle
punch. He is funny in a felicitously origi
nal fashion and has a splendid part as
Tweedlepuneh.
"Tell Me, Pretty Maiden." sung by
the double sextet. Is probably one of the
prettiest numbers ever seen on the local
stage, and was encored time and again
by the audience, which went away at 11:15
\u25a0whistling it.
"Florodora" has certainly "arrived.

day from Carroll* Holmes after listening
to the testimony of the wife, her mother

Holmes had once made a deed of some

only playing a joke.

THE NEW GRAND JURY
The plaintiffs charge in their complaint
that on September 20, 1901, they bought
from the Agard & Russell Company out
standing accounts due the firm, from
various debtors amounting to $17,000. of
which ?4000 is due from the defendant.
Upon the purchase. of these accounts the
plaintiffs and defendant became co
partners In the grocery business. Since
the firm was organized, the plaintiffs
claim, the defendant has failed to live up
to his agreement and has appropriated to
his own use money he has collected. They
Bay they have been excluded from col
lecting at all | and that Russell Is taking
money in excess of the amount to which
he is entitled.
OAKLAND, Sept. 30.â Suit was begun
to-day for a dissolution of the partnership
existing among the members of the Agard
& Russell Company and the appointment
of a receiver to take charge of the busi
ness. The plaintiffs are George W. Scott,
John F. Agard and James J. Agard and
the defendant is George A. Russell. .

BHORT LIVED EXISTENCE
OF A GROCERY ITRK
In some way the underpinning of the
warehouse gave way on Saturday night.
TVhen the drop came the warehouse burst
wide open, and the grain was spread
over the country for hundreds of feet
around.
The loss will fall entirely upon the Vol
mer company, for they purchased the
grain outright and owned the contents of
the warehouse. The loss will amount to
about $5000.
With a crash that was heard for *a mile
around, the great Volmer warehouse at
Decoto burst open on Saturday night and
buried the railroad track in grain. It
was found necessary to dig a way
through the loose grain in order to per
mit the passage of the regular trains.
The wrecking of the warehouse was onÂ©
of the most peculiar, as well as disast
rous, events that has happened In the
lower part of the county. R. Volmer &
Co. had filled the warehouse to the very
roof with grain which they had purchased
from the farmers of "Washington Town
ship. The inability of the farmers to
get their grain to a market in San Fran
cisco, or to the shipping at Port Costa,
made the purchase of grain a profitable
Investment. Volmer & Co.. have been
making large purchases for several weeks
and they stored their purchases In their
warehouse at Decoto.

SAN FRANCISCO is now lined up

conquered. Every seat was. filled
last night at the Columbia to greet the
tuneful comedy, and almost as many peo

Owen Hall, who wrote the book of "The
Geisha," has written a vastly smarter
one for '"FloroJora." achieving an almost
Oscar. Wilde figure in the satiric society
widow. Lady Holyrood. The plot has a
little more fiber than is common with its
kind, the lines are sufficiently bright, and
the book is fitted to catchy, sparkling
melodies throughout, for which Mr. Leslie
Stewart is responsible. The mountings

BIOTERS IDENTIFIED.
I have a widowed mother and three sisters
whom I have to support. I was engaged to
drive team here by the Independent Employ
ment Bureau on California street. I wrote to
them about getting work and they replied that
they would put me to work driving team iÂ£ I
would come down.
to get my team out, the crowd hollered "scab"
at me and shouted "whoa" when I tried to
drive the horses. The men who followed me
up the street from the truck I recognized as
being men I had seen in the crowd when I waa
trying to get the team out. When they fol
lowed me up the . street they called me a
"scab," but I did not pay any attention to
them; nor did I pay any attention to them
when they abused me while I 'was trying to
get the team out. I thought I could get the
team- out without having any trouble with
them. When the gang grabbed me on the cross-
Ing- they tried to drag me into the alley off
the main street.
E. G. Cantrell of the National Foundry
made the following statement last night:
When the machinists returned to â¢work to-day
it was with the distinct understanding that
they were to work ten hours. Their failure to
do 69 was a violation of that agreement. While
ire have opposed the demands of the strikers
\u25a0we nave at no time resisted the nine-hour plan,
provided pay for nine hours only should be the
rule. "When the men went back we believed
the strike teas practically settling itself, but
we never Intended it to be understood that we
were making any concessions to the men. I
o confident that the men would never have re
fused to work more. than nine hours had it not
been for the presence of the pickets outside the
works. The men feared violence and were com
pelled to take the step they did. "We will hold
out to the last. I am sorry 'for the men, many
of -.whom are now In destitute circumstances.
They want to work but dare not. That is the
disgraceful condition of affairs In this city at
the present time.
At" the office of Business Agent "Wisler
of the Machinists' Union it was asserted
In the afternoon that the National Iron
Works'' managers had agreed to the nine
hour d&"y at a rate of wages that was
"satisfactory to the men and to the com
mittee."
A gain of ten machinists was made yes
terday by the Risdon Iron "Works and
eight by the Union Iron "Works. In these
instances the returning machinists were
not so easy of access by the pickets, the
result being that the men were not inter
fered with. These men worked the full
ten hours, according to the old schedule,
and when they quit work it was the un
derstanding that they would return this
morning. Some of the men remained in
the works, where the company maintains
a boarding house, and even if the others
do not return those now in the works are
certain to remain.
No Concessions Hade.
Promptly at 5 o'clock the men threw
down their tools and the hum of the ma
chinery was stilled. Several of the older
employes, all men of large families, left
the shop with tear-dimmed eyes, and all
of them expressed their regret at the out
come of the affair. They were willing
and anxious to work, they said, but they
were forced to obey orders from union
headquarters, although in doing so they
were actually depriving their wives and
children of their daily bread. The firm
declined to reeognize the nine-hour sched
ule, whereupon the men announced that
they could not again return to work un
less the union demands were recognized.
As this surrender is improbable, the Na
tional Foundry wiu remain closed for the
present.
Leave Shops Reluctantly.
the banners of the employers.
Some thirty-five machinists returned to
work after having accepted, so the em
ployers assert, the old ten-hour schedule,
but during the day. the pickets got in
their work and at 5 o'clock last evening,
after working- nine hours, the greater
â¢number of tne men ceased operations
with the announcement that they would
not return again until the demands of
the strikers outlined on May 20 had been
"granted.
The shop particularly interested in this
ultimatum is the National Iron Works,
conducted by Messrs. Marshutz & Can
trell at Howard and Main streets. On
May 20 when the strike was declared this
firm lost some forty employes and since
that time its operations were almost
completely .at a standstill. The firm de
clined persistently to grant the nine
hour day with ten hours' pay. Lat>t
Thursday the executive committee of the
Machinists* Union called upon Mr. Can
trell and after a conference the agree
ment was reached that the ten-hour rule
would be temporarily maintained, the
men agreeing to stand by the old sched
ule. The firm was at no time unwilling
to recognize the nine-hour rule, provided
pay for nine hours' work was accepted.
This proposition was distasteful to the
leaders of the striking macniniBts, but
some of the men themselves secretly
favored the plan.
In consequence of the agreement ar
rived at with Mr. Cantrell. fifteen ma
chinists, five blacksmiths and two mold
ers appeared at the foundry at 7 o'clock
yesterday morning and began operations.
A few minutes later tne union pickets
began to arrive, and throughout the. day
their number was augmented until 5
o'clock, when fully one hundred strikers
were on hand. At noon several of the
machinists in the foundry were ap
proached by the pickets, and an animat
ed debate was the result. When the men
returned to work at 1 o'clock the formal
announcement was made that the crew
would work until 5 o'clock only. Mr. Can
trell interrogated the men, and charged
them with violating the terms of their
agreement. The men said they were sor
ry, but it was unwise for them to work
according to the schedule In force at the
time of the inauguration of the strike.
They glanced with considerable concern
at the crowd of pickets outside, and one
cf them hinted that it might be danger
ous for them to work the limit of ten
hours. That the presence of the pickets
had the effect of intimidating the men
and forcing them to a violation of their
agreement to work ten hours until fur
ther notice, the members of the firm do
uot hesitate to declare.

To the Editor of the Examiner: I most em
phatically deny the statement published in the
Examiner relative to the shooting affray which
occurred on Kearny street Sunday morning. I
did not make the remarks attributed to me by
the Examiner reporter, Â»who misquoted every
remark made by me on that occasion. Yours
truly, - LEON COHEN.
I ' did not make the statement attributed to
me by the Examiner reporter. I am positive
the specials did not fire the first shot. I was
on the right side of the street where the strik
ers were gathered, and I know the shooting
did not be^in on the east side. The Kxamlner,
for purposes of its own, has deliberately falsi
fied my statements, and I to-day sent a letter
protesting against being placed in a false posi
tion. /
The/ letter addressed to the Examiner
by Mr. Cohen is as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 30, 1901.
Mr. Coben indignantly denies the truth
of the published report of the affair as
far aa he is concerned. He said last
night:
I was on the west side of Kearny street,
near Unfon Square avenue. I saw half a dozen
men on the opposite 6lde of the street. Just
then another group came out of the avenue.
As these men came on to Kearny street one
of the crowd across the way said: "There
they are; now let them have It." - A
shot followed the words and the next instant
a dozen men were* firing at each other. I am
positive the men' on the east side of Kearny
street fired the first shot.
In its reference to the shooting, affray
the Examiner quotes Leon Cohen of 790
Bush street as saying that the firing wa3
begun by the special police who were on
the east side of "Kearny street, while the
pursuing strikers were on the west side.
Mr. Cohen is made to say:
Garbles an Interview.
The published report that the specials were
violent and unruly in my house on Saturday
night is absolutely false. They disturbed no
one. No attempt was made to display a pistol
nor did they utter a single word to the dozens
of strikers who were in the place. My atten
tion was called to a remark made by one of
the strikers, which was to the effect that the
strikers intended to do the specials up. Fear
ing they intended to assault the specials in the
house, I made preparations for the event by
warning my waiters to look out for trouble.
The specials left the place about five minutea
to 1 o'clock, and were followed by the entire
gathering of strikers, -which at that tlma-num
bered not less than 100. The specials left with
out saying a word to any one. I can get fifty
witnesses to swear to the truth of this" state
ment. : ...
In his letter to the Examiner yester
day. Father Yorke comments upon the
shooting of Sunday morning and after re
ferring ..to the appearance at the Thalia
of' the special policemen engaged in that
affair he says:
"What happened last night? The special
policemen who are empowered to preserve law
and order in San Francisco got so violent and
intolerable in the Thalia that the proprietor
was compelled to telephone for the police. Did
the police come? No; the police were too busy
chasing ghosts on the water front. Did the
specials leave? They did; they left full of
whisky and fight.
This statement, which is reinforced by
another in the same issue of the Exam
iner in which it is made to appear that
the special policemen flourished revolvers
in the faces of patrons of the Thalia, i-j
denied by Joseph Schwartz, proprietor of
the Thalia, as being false in every detail.
Mr. Schwartz made the following state
ment to a Call reporter last night:
the Examiner has not disdained to
misquote and falsify, and the Rev. Poter
C. Torke. relying upon information fur
nished by that paper, makes assertions
equally at variance .with the facts.

Decision Adding â¢ Several Thousand
Mongolian Voters to American
Register Is Handed Down.
A decision by the 'United States Treas
ury Department affecting the status of
Chinese born or naturalized In the Ha-*,
walian Islands before the annexation waa
handed down yesterday to Port Collector
Stratton. It â¢ was in the case of Ti L.1
Hong, a merchant, who arrived from Hon
olulu several weeks ago. TI is a native
Chinaman,- but became a citizen' of Ha
waii. several years ago. On leaving Hono
lulu for this port Ti applied for a certifi
cate to the effect that he was a merchant â¢
and entitled to visit the United States.
The Collector of the Port at Honolulu waa
of the opinion that Ti. being a natural
ized citizen of Hawaii at the time of tha
annexation, waa therefore a naturalized
citizen of the United States, notwith
standing that the naturalization laws oC
this country extend only to the. Cauca
sian and African races. The annexation
act provides that all citizens of Hawaii
at the time of annexation became citizens
â¢ of the United States.
This view of the Collector at the port
of Honolulu has been indorsed by the
Treasury Department, and Collector
Stratton yesterday allowed TI La Hone
to land as an American citizen.

James F. Dunne,- surviving partner of
the cattle firm of Donnelly, Dunne & Co.,
filed a suit for an accounting In the Su
perior Court yesterday against U V.
Maxwell and R. L. Barry, executors of
the will of the late E. T. Donnelly.
Dunne alleges in his complaint that at
the time of Donnelly's death in April,
1&00, the firm of Dunne & Donnelly owned
property valued at $200,000, with liabilities
amounting to $190,000. He further alleges
that the property. If sold, would not
realize a sufficient sum to pay the debts.
Dunne claims that he has asked the
executors for an accounting and that his
request was not granted. He therefore
asks the court to declare the partnership
still in existence and to order that the
executors be required to turn over suffi
cient property to pay the debts.
The principal item mentioned in the
complaint is a loan of $100,000 secured by
Dunne from the Hibernia Bank. A large
sum Is also due A. B. McCreery for the
rent of the Los Aguilas ranch.

Not content with her success she
scoured the city's places of amusement
and finally secured a position as amateur
at the Chutes, where she appeared for
two or three successive Thursday nights.
From there she went to the Olympla,
where she sung last Friday evening. On
Saturday her course was arrested by Sec
retary White of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children, who took
charge of her until she was committed.
Little 13-year-old Mary Smith was rude
ly awakened from her dreams of. a career
on the variety stage by Judge Fritz yes
terday, and sent to complete her educa
tion at the Magdalen Asylum.
Until about a month ago the would-be
actress lived in Sausalito, but tiring of
pastoral life across the bay she resolved
to try her talents In the metropolis and
ran away from her fosterparents. Much
to her surprise she found that theatrical
managers did not appear to take kindly
to her and she entered the employ of a
lodging-house keeper, under whose direc
tion she became proficient in the care of
rooms.
Thirteen- Year-Old Mary Smith of
Sausalito Is Sent to Magdalen
Asylum.
To-day Captain Seymour intends to
charge them with rioting, under sections
401 and 406 of the Penal Code, which makes
it an indictable misdemeanor, punishable
by two years' imprisonment In the County
Jail or a fine of 52000, or both.
Johnson was, on May 6, 1895, sentenced
to six months in the County Jail for petty
larceny; April 19, 189a, he got six months
for misdemeanor embezzlement, and De
cember 9, the same year, he got six
months for -petty larceny. June 12, , 1900,
under the name of John Brady he got
forty days for petty larceny. January 10,
this year,' he got sixty days for petty lar
ceny, and April 15 he got six months for
petty larceny, both under the name of
Brady. He was released from the County
Jail on September 9.
Captain Wittman yesterday preferred
charges before the Police Commissioners
against Samuel Caldwell, the hackman
who refused to drive a non-union
wounded man to the Emergency Hospital
when requested to do so by the captain
at the time of the riot. The case will
come before the Commissioners to-night
and Caldwell will probably lose his
license.
The four specials were then escorted to
the prison, and told to pick out the men
who were responsible for the riot. Special
Officer Bogan, without a moment's hesi
tancy, pointed to Johnson/' Duggan and
Tatts- as the men who took part in the at
tack on him and his companions. Special
Officer L. A. Decote positively identified
\u25a0Tate and Johnson, and Special Officer
Grandall had no trouble in picking- out
Duggan, who, he declared, was one of
the most aggressive of the mob. The
identification was made complete when W.
T. Rawlins, a sailor who was with the
specials when they were fired on, picked
out the four strikers.
Tlllman recognized them as the men who
were seen hanging around the Thalia on
the night of â¢ the trouble, inciting their
fellow strikers to wreak vengeance on the
quartet of Curtin's men.
Shortly after 7 o'clock last night the
imprisoned strikers were taken from their
cells and lined' up with several "trusties"
who were dressed as laborers.
This afternoon I was driving my team from
the Santa Fe depot to' a store up on Market
street. (By Policeman Livingston: * The store
of Quadt. on Market street, above Larkin.) .1
got stalled at Howard and Seventh streets and
the (special policeman who . was with me ad
vised mÂ« to telephone to the . head office for a
team. A crowd collected around the truck and
I went up the street to telephone. I went up
Seventh street to between Mission and Market.
I could have gone into a place nearer the
truck, but I thought the keepers of the places
so near the truck would not let me telephone.
Between- Mission and Market I went Into a
store and telephoned. Four or five fellows fol
lowed me up the street from the truck, and
they were standing at the door of the store
when I came out. I then walked a few doors
further and went Into a saloon and had a
drink, thinking I could get rid \u25a0 of them. Two
of them followed me Into the saloon, and they
had a drink. When I left the saloon I walked
down the street toward my truck and the same
five fellows followed me. I had walked about
one block and was crossing: an alley when the
fellows closed up around me on the sides and
at my back and one of them said: "Grab him
now." They then grabbed my arms and tried
to get me by the back- While I was swinging
and struggling with them I 'pulled my six
shooter and said that if they did not turn me
loose I would shoot. They would not let go
of me. I managed to get *my six-shooter
around to what I thought was the right place
ana then I shot the man on my left. The other
two men who had hold of me then let go and
I shot at the man at my back. They then
grabbed me and threw me "down and tried to
beat me. - As I was going down I shot another
man. I think I hit him In the breast. As I
was getting up I fired the fourth ( shot, and
then they all ran away. I then ran down to
Mission street and got.on the car and 1 rode out
to the Seventeenth-street police station, where
I told the officer in charge what had happened.
The officer telephoned and learned j that some
officers had already been sent to the place. He
then advised me. to. go back on the Howard
street car. I did so, and when I got back to
where my team was I had police protection and
pulled my team" out with the aid of a. team
which had been sent from the head office. Then
I came on home. .

Gentry made the following statement to
the police last night:
Statement Made to Police.
The Ryans say they were, perfectly
innocent of any intention to harm Gentry.
According to their story they happened
upon the street by accident and were un
fortunate enough to reach Minna street
when Gentry was having some trouble
with a few boys. Gentry tells a different
story and identifies the men he wounded
as the men who attacked him.
Gentry fired all the cartridges in his
revolver and a house wall at Seventh and
Minna streets shows the course of those
bullets that did not penetrate the bodies
of the Ryans. ' .
horses to help him out of his predicament.
Gentry went to a saloon at Seventh and
Minna streets to telephone, and as soon
as he left the place he was attacked by
several men. The attacking party
pinioned his arms and proceeded to. beat
him. In some way Gentry got his right
arm free and grasped his pistol, which
was in a holster hanging to his left side.
He fired immediately, the first shot plow
ing through the shoulder of Chris Ryan's
coat and setting the cloth on fire. The
second shot entered his groin. John
Ryan, who was with his brother, received
a bullet in the thigh. \u25a0 \u25a0 > :

he drove a team for Schussler Bros., but
his brother had been out of employment
for some time. . . â¢
The teamster who did the shooting came
here recetly from Keswick. He had been
forced out of employment by strikers
going to the mining camp and offering to
\u25a0work for less money than he was being
paid. As a retaliatory measure he "came
to this city and secured work as a team

men will live, although their wounds are
very serious.
The man who did the shooting is E. W.
Gentry, a driver in the employ of the
Western Transfer and Storage Company.
He surrendered himself to the police
after the shooting and was permitted to
go on his way by order of the Chief of
Police.
SEVERAL union teamsters made an
attack on a non-union driver
shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday
afternoon at Seventh and Minna
streets, and . a fusillade of <?hots
â¢was fired with disastrous results to two of
the attacking party â Chris and John
Ryan.
O'Rourke says he is jubilant that he
came out here before the fight, as the
visit opened his eyes to Walcott's du
plicity. He knew that "Walcott was going
to give him the cold shoulder, he says,
and he was so angry on the night of the
contest that he wanted to go behind
Gardner, just for the pleasure of seeing
the black man worsted in the nght.
After the battle O'Rourke devoted his
attention to the money the colored man
received for winning. Walcott owed him
nearly $1300 on a mortgage and for per
sonal loans and he was determined to col
lect the amount. On Sunday night
O'Rourke went to Mitchell's saloon and
made such a protest that Walcott and the
Hergets turned over to him the sum of
$1270. This sum was deposited in Charley
Newman's until yesterday afternoon,
when it was placed in a bank. \u25a0 u
"I thought the Hergets were my frinds,"
said O'Rourke yesterday. "Their actions
prove that they are not. They are wel
come to Walcott. Mark my words he will
prove a stumbling block in their path and
a thorn in their sides. I was the only
man who could handle* him and get any
results out of him. He owes monev to
everybody and will owe money to more
people before he leaves -town."
V.'alcott yesterday affixed his signature
to articles of agreement to flght "Kid"
Carter before the Twentieth Century Club
on Tuesday- evening/ October 15. The
winner of this battle will receive 75 per
cent of the gross receipts and the loser
25 per cent. Walcott will start in training
to-day at Frizzes, Larkspur. Carter is at
work on the Wilson rancn, near Bolinas.
He was in town two days ago and looked
heavier and more rugged. He has been
