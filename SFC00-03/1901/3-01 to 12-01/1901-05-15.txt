. â¢; â¢;. It was a great reception" from the' moment the Presidential train rolled Into

./; brilliantly, illuminated streets thronged with cheering thousandsâ a reception that
seemed a glittering avenue of light, brilliant as the sun, col
ored like the rainbow and reachiug far away until each lamp
was a tiny spark and each glorious arch a narrow, gleaming
band. . â¢- 1 Â¦*
Down the center of the hall was stretched a wire netting,
dividing the space into two way3. Again the western side
was divided at the entering stairway and on Into the street
the division was carried, so as to catch the crowd before it
became unmanageable and turn it into the way it should' go.
The idea was that the people: should come in through tha
stairway, turn ". to the south and walk down' to the end and
past the President's stand," then turning to the . north walk the
length of the nave ; and turn again to the south until the stair
way was reached again- .Then ';the. hope was that the people
would go out. into the street and lose 1 themselves.
The wire netting was - dotted with pink geraniums, wreaths j
and garlands of green. At the upper end and just before the
..President's position, was.a.mlniature.of.the Ohio, its shrouds
hung with tiny lights and over it its name in flowers^
The President's stand wa3 decorated in the trl-color and

OF the tremendous crowd that surged around the
ferry building and crushed through its great nave
last evening, not one one-hundredth saw the Presi
dent and not one one-thousandth heard his vblce.
The arrangements were good In theory but bad in
practice. They contemplated a grand review of the
people of the city passing before the President, who
would stand on a raised platform and greet the
citizens as they passed, but no consideration was
given to human curlooslty and human selfishness, and instead
of moviKg when the time came, the lucky ones stayed and lis
tened and refused to move, and the unlucky ones crowded and
crushed and sweated and many were pulled fainting frorn^ the
pack. yO.
It was one of the grandest sights a mind could conceive,
that of two swaying, swinging lines of people slowly working
their way up one side of the nave and down the other, under
the gleaming lamps that stretched in arches far away., until .
they blended their luster and became a blur of colored light.
McKinley stood on a high platform at the southern end
of the nave and looked down six hundred feet to. where a
gleam of red light, like an eye of fire, marked the north
wall. Radiating from this were beams of red and" white and"
blue, and above it and down the sides sprung arches outlined
In fire and banked one upon the other through the length of
the great hall. On the sides, too, lamps flashed bright

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.CALL SIGNAL THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRESIDENT
THE SAff If K AiN UlSUU CALL, WEDNESDArY, yAY 15, 19U1 .
President Turns to Bow to the "Workingmen.
The enthusiasm at the depot was prophetfc of what was to come and Mc
Â£inley smiled and bowed repeatedly. A group of railroad employes standing
lust inside the gate gave three lusty cheers for the President, and he turned
and raised his hat and -waved his hand In recognition of their greeting.
The carriage rattled up the street, the four mounted policemen of his body
ruard keeping pace as outriders. The other carriages were filled rapidly with the
members of the Presidential party, committeemen .- and others of -. prominence.
General Warfleld, the grand marshal, gave command, a bugler sounded "For
ward, march!" and the parade moved up Third street between two dense lines
of madly cheering people. - '
Then an unprecedented transformation occurred. The flag on the staff sur
mounting the dome of The. Call building. was suddenly unfurled, and simultane
ously a bomb exploded with a roar and a volley of day rockets
went hurtling high . into the air from the top . of the sky
scraper. The effect was more than electrical. Immediately whistles . began to
eound and In a moment their various tones mingled In a . mighty crescendo.
Prom mills, factories and locomotives arose the screech of sibilant steam, sirens
shrieked and the deeper notes from steamship whistles came roaring up from the
bay. Bombs exploded, cannons barked and roared. ââ¢ From every block of Its
territory San Francisco was saying welcome '. '- : "â¢Â¦"'
Like magic windows and roofs and streets were filled Â¦with . cheering people
and' waving flags. 'No longer was there thought of business cares. Men, women
and children massed in an incredibly short time along the line the parade would
follow. Sidewalk space was filled until progress wa3 difficult or impossible.
Third street, Montgomery and Kearny as far as Bush street; and Market -out to
V'iin Ness avenue swarmed with people struggling for places from which the
pageant they knew was coining could -be seen to advantage., * â¢
The Presidential train arrived a trifle late. President McKinley was ushered
out from the flag-bedecked depot into Third street. Mayor Phelan and' Irving M.
Scott on either side of him. His bodyguard of policemen and detectives was
close at hand and an adequate force of policemen held the surging, cheering
zrovrd back while the President was being shown to his carriage.
The Call's Signal Caused Big Transformation.
Thin lines of people gathered along the- wire ropes stretched on the line of
march to keep the crowds In check. At some points of vantage crowds began
to collect, but for the most part there was nothing to indicate the massing of*
such throngs as former, red-letter days for San- Francisco had seen.
. In the vicinity of Third and To wnsend streets the sidewalks were crowded
ar>d every window, housetop, telegraph pole or other, place that afforded visual
advantage * was occupied. Carriages with well-known citizens arrived early and
stood in lines waiting for the President to come. Sturdy bluejackets 'ana
marines came swinging along on the way from landing places to their assigned
positions on Townsend street- to await the. parade's formation. Clattering
artillery and yellow-plumed troops of horse hastened to the rendezvous.
Up on Market street and beyond there was an air oÂ£_ expectancy, but not
great crowds, even when clocks showed the time for the arrival -of the Presi
dent; had come and five, ten, fifteen minutes had passed. Â¦â¢â¢':â¢
warmed the cockles of his heart and wreathed his face with, smiles. Gratification
ehone in the countenance of the President and, intent upon the manifestations
of the love and loyalty of his countrymen, he was oblivious to fog. and wind and
fatigue. .-, ;-' â
No Presage of the Afternoon's Enthusiasm.
The forenoon gave little presage of what the afternoon was to bring. Men
went 'about their business as if they could not leave office or counting room or
shop business,- even' on 'so great an occasion. Commercial activity scarcely
showed diminution as noon came and as the scheduled hour of the President's
arrival approached. True, the city was garbed in holiday attire. Flags fluttered
from fiagstaffs and.. housetops. Bunting and gay pennants, evergreens and a
wealth of floral decorations were the gages of the city's hospitality, but individ
uals 'seemed apathetic and trade flowed on in its accustomed channels. Even
while troops and batteries and battalions were clattering noisily toward the
point; of parade formation, trucks and drays busily employed at work that could
not wait got in the way of the military and retarded progress toward the
depot. - . . * .
THE CALL'S arrangements
for announcing the arrival of
President McKinley in " the
city were a great success.
Everything went like-clock
work. The moment the train
bearing the distinguished vis
* itor pulled into the depot at
â¢ Third and Xownsend streets
, bomb shot high into the air above
Be Claus Spreckels building and ex
loding with a loud report announced
* the expectant thousands that the Presi
ent had arrived. The next instant a
ijghty shout of welcome resounded from
tie assembled throngs in the streets be
Â»w, drowning the shrieking whistles
rhich had caught up the signal from the
Sail's bomb.
With the approval of the executive com
sittee in charge of the preparations for
ae McKinley reception the official slg
al of the arrival of the Presidential' train
fas to be by day rockets being sent up
nd the nag unfurled from the dome of
ae Claus Spreckels building. A direct
fire was laid between the depot at Third
nd Townsend streets and the business of
ce of The Call. Another wire connected
ae office with the dome of the tall build
ig so the transmission of the signal was
lxnost instantaneous. The train dis
atcher at the depot at Third and Town
end streets stood at his key and the mo
icnt the train slowly rounded the curve

waited sisrnaL
It was exactly at 3:56 p. m. when the
was received in the Call business
Bice. The signal was instantly communi
tted to those waiting in the tower, and in
second a bomb was discharged and "Old
iory" was flung to the breeze.
The signal came somewhat unexpectedly

laitlng to greet the President. But In a
tcond they realized that the city's dls-

tinguished guest was at last here and a
mighty shout went up. A second bomb
was fired several seconds after the first
by the watchers on the dome of the Claus
Spreckels building; and just as the smoke
was clearing away the powerful siren on
the roof of the Examinerf building bel
lowed out a rousing welcome; The Ex
aminer's siren was the first whistle to
take up the Call's official signal and soon
after every steam whistle in the city was
hard at work. The factory whistles, the
ferryboats' sirens and even the railroad
engines way down the Potrero- were by
this time making as much noise as they
could. Lads with miniature cannon on the
roofs of houses . fired ' salutes and the
whole town was in a din of uproarious de
llg-ht and enthusiasm.
The Japanese rockets discharged from
the dome of the Claus Spreckels building
worked like a charm. At â¢ intervals
of a half â¢ minute one was discharged
skyward. A stiff breeze was blowing and
they sailed to all parts of the city.
Everybody was pleased with The Call's
splendid service. Congratulations came
pouring Into the offices of the paper from
every source for the enterprise shown in
giving the residents of , this city such a
novel and prompt information of the ar
rival- of the President in our midst.
The decorations and illuminations of
the Claus Spreckels building came in al
so for great praise. Promptly at 8 o'clock
last night the many thousand electric
lamps were turned on. The illumination
of the building was almost" instantaneous
and with the lights turned on the streets
below became as light- as- day.
The general effect of the illumination of
the building was best apparent when
viewed ' from,- a distance. The ef
fect standing several blocks away was
marvelous. . The building presented the
appearance of . a beautiful fairy house
studded with Â¦â¢' diamonds. Old travelers
and globe trotters who make it a point to
witness carnivals and celebrations In all
parts of the world said that' no Illumina
tion they had ever witnessed was so ar
tistically-conceived and carried out.

neat and tasteful finish to the scheme.
: .The Crowd. Enters. Â¦* /
It was half-past 9 o'clock before the
crowd. was let in. It. was a quarter to 10
before the President had taken his seat.
It was fifteen minutes later when he rose
after the speech-making and left -. the
stand, while the. struggling mass of peo
ple, forgetful of all. else but a chance to
see his face, stood and stared and jostled
and passed the fainting women into .the
press stand and bore with unruffled tpa-.
tience and good humor the shouts of the
police and the prods from the muskets of
the soldiers whose duty it was to keep the
crowd moving. : " _. _ \. "-
That duty devolved on the First Cali
fornia Regiment, rounder command of
Colonel O'Neill, and the First Battalion
of the Fifth Regiment, under command of
Major L. W. Joulllard. The men marched
into the hall long before the crowd waa
let in, and they were stationed in lines
down both walls and back on each side or
the dividing line of flowers. They did
magnificent service and to them is due the
absence of serious Injury to any one.

McKinley Conies Forward.
There was no doubt who was who, how
ever, when the â¢ President after being
taken through a side door was brought on
the platform, and then a cheer that made
the arches tremble burst from the people,
whilefar down the naveâ it = seemed miles
awayâ came the faint but stirring notes of
"Hail to the Chief." S Â¦ Â¦ ' Â¦ '
McKinley was in the center of the plat
form, seated in an imposing high-backed
chair. Mayor Phelan was on his right
and Governor Gage, who met him, upon
the stand, was on his left. On the right
of Mr. Phelan and on the. left of Gover
nor Gage were seated Cabinet officers,
and on the extreme right and left were
seated the executive committee and the
officers of the Governor's staff all in uni?
form. Behind the President was seated
the Governor of Ohio and the Ohio dele
gation and Â¦ then behind that were seated
the Supervisors, Federal ojcers, promi

reception committee. . . ' i >

TPhelstn's Speech.
. When Mayor Phelan rose to speak, the
people had packed into the end of the
heard, but now and then he road* a fa
miliar reference and the crowd cheered
and waved flags and hats and canes and
crushed closer to the platform. At Fhe
lan's reference to the First California,
the pioneer - regiment In the Philippines,
there was 1 tremendous enthusiasm.; there
was more when he referred to the Oregon
and there was almost hysteria when he
spoke of the Ohio, the great vessel that
will.take' her first plunge next "Saturday.
He said:
Mr. President: The people of San-Fran
cisco bid you cordial and patriotic wel
come. They have for many days been
making ready for your coming and now
enjoy the pleasure and the honor of re
ceiving and entertaining their President,
the President - of the republic of which
they are ""a- devoted part and in whose
greatness: and glory they are proud to
share.
. w d feel that San Francisco Is Indeed
one- of the nation's capitals. Our city not
only renders municipal service for Its In
habitants and . fulfils the purposes of a
metropolis as: the chief city of a great
State, but its position Is better defined as
the principal port of the United States on
the Pacific Ocean. It Is therefore, Mr.
President," in a peculiar sense your city as
well as ours.. It belongs to the country.
As late - as 184% however, Daniel Web
ster said that California on account of her
remoteness could never be expected to ac
cept laws from Congress. But it Is a mat
ter of history that she eagerly joined the
union of States, and you know, Mr. Presl
rdent,-havlng Just crossed the broad conti
nent, that you were never absent for an
hour from the seat of government I We
are no longer remote. It is true that forty
long days-elapsed after our admission be
fore we were appraised of the event, but
Invention and enterprise which Webster
failed to foresee have since that day dis
tanced the revolutions of the earth and we
can now -in point of time anticipate Con
gress itself In the passage of its acts. By
the grace of electricity our western posi
tion puts us in the vanguard of the sun
and by the awakening of the Pacific we
have become a center, whereas we were
an outpost.
San Francisco a World City.
We are Indeed a world city, serving the
United States on the greatest of the
world's oceans. The lands beyond look to
us for commerce and trade; the armies of
our country camp within our confines; her
transport fleets crowd our docks; her
squadrons ride at anchor in our bay. We
have been and are an active and patriotic
factor In the stirring events of your ad
ministration, and while serving our coun
try, permit me to say that San Francisco
has splendidly vindicated her own es
cutcheon, which Is inscribed with the old
Spanish legend, betraying her origin, *Oro
en paz, flerro en guerra," "Gold In peace,
iron in war." For ours is the golden ore.
the golden grain, the golden fruit, and I
may say the golden opportunity, which
the march of events has opened to us;
while iron, emblematic of fortitude, indus
try and the mechanic arts, has been illus
trated by our people in every field. The
first transport that ever departed from our
country's shores on a warlike . mission
carried a San Francisco regiment,- the

the energy displayed by the officers there
was not an accident to mar the splendid
spectacle. On every corner and within
hailing distance of. each other the officers,
dressed In their best uniforms, kept .coat,
stant watch. Their vigilance and closeat

Lieutenant of Police Anderson and a po

the two rode through the lines and saw
that everything was In readiness for the
parade. Chief Sullivan was one of the
busiest men on the street. He was every

to his men.- Captain Sptllane of the South
ern Station had a post of honor in tiie pa
rade. He marched at the side of the Pres
ident's carriage and was In virtual com
mand of the escort to the Chief Executive.
All along the Una of march the popular
officer received the salutes of his men and
returned them with the military precision
for which he is noted.
At the reviewing stand there was none
of that confusion that Is not unusual in
affairs of this kind. A strong cordon of
policemen under the command of Sergeant
Wolff kept Interlopers from taking posses

crowding too close to the temporary
wooden structure.
Â». Sergeant Clarence Coogan and bis squad
of mounted policemen won the admiration
of thousands along the line of march.
They led the procession and their ac
couterments and clean-limbed steeds won
the unstinted praise of every one.
The cordon of policemen and detectives
that surrounded thÂ© President's carriage

was not attempted. Only in a few in

With faltering steps the Veteran Guard,
Grand Army of the Republic, marched up
to the depot, stepping out with brave ef
fort to the music of drums and fifes. The
old soldiers were to form the guard of
honor to the President,, Surrounding a
carriage that held four old comrades of
President McKlnley the veterans were the
center of attraction. In the carriage rode
H. H. Woodruff of Oakland. M. V. Ritter
of San Leandro, O. P. Burgett of Meridian
end C. W. Moore of Yuba. The old sol
diers carefully guarded four tattered bat
tle flaps brought from the State House at
Columbus, Ohio, / by Governor Xash. The
flags were those of the Twenty-third Ohio
Regiment, in which President McKlnley
served during the war, and were carried
through many a bloody battle.
Shortly after 3 p. m. carriages drove up
to the depot bearing the visiting Con
gressmen and the local reception commit
tee. Shortly afterward a four-horse car
riage gaily bedecked with American flags
drove up to the main entrance of the de
pot. The carriage had been sent by Henry
T. Scott for the use of the President, but
General "Warfleid. grand marshal of the
day, would not allow it to be used. Gen
eral Warfield had furnished a four-horse
carriage without American flags, and in
sisted that the carriage of- Mr. Scott
should not be used. The grand marshal
won a victory and the President was
driven through the city in the hired ve
hicle, while the private carriage of Mr.
Scott was sent to the stables. The little
Incident was unknown to the President,
and the crowds that had witnessed the
gorgeous Scott eaulpage drive up to the
depot marveled afterward why it was not
used in the procession.

Fails to Appear
Stanford's Assembly
Hall Rings With the
Cheers of Students
By W. F\ Burke,
Staff Correspondent of The CalL
PALO ALTO, May 14.â The
assembly hall of Stanford
University rang with college
yells, college songs, the mu
sic from the college band
and the furious applause of
enthusiastic students to-day,
for they"- were as near see
ing a real live President as
they ever had been and they gave full
swing to their enthusiasm over the occa
sion. The President was to have visited
Palo Alto this morning, but he did not,
and In view of the cause of his absence
the students made no complaint, but set
about entertaining the distinguished mem
bers of the remainder of the party whom
they had with them.
There was some delay at the railway
Btation, for it was not until the last mo
ment that it was definitely known Mc-
Kinley would not be with them, so when
the party reached the assembly hall the
students already filled the floor and most
of the gallery and members of the Grand
Army of the" Republic and citizens from
the town of Palo Alto filled the rest of
the hall. In the center of the floor were
the rooters and yellers, led by "W. F. llc-
Cormick, yell leader of the college. On
the left and in the gallery was the Glee
Club and opposite it on the right was the
college band. In the center of the gal
lery were the Palo Altoans, and in the
center of them four hoary veterans, the
Grand Army men of Palo Alto, sat with
their flags leaning over the gallery rail
and drooping their folds over the heads
of the people below. Beyond these as
signments there was no system in seat-
Ing the students, so co-eds were mingled
with their scholastic brethren Indiscrim
inately, and with their gay ribbons, pic
turesque gowns and mortar boards and
faces . beaming with pride for their alma
mater, they lent no little, assistance to
the effect of the decorations that hung
from. wall and eallery..
Decorations of Cardinal Hue.
The cardinal of Stanford was the theme
of the decorations. Across the front of
the stage stood a row of flower pots,
Fwathed In brilliant red bunting and over
flowing with a wealth of delicate green
maidenhair . ferns. Into these ferns had
been clustered red carnations in riotous
profusion, and in the glare of the foot
lights they seemed like a band of flame
reaching from wing to wing and flapping
as the carnations nodded their gorgeous
heads. The stage itself was set with wav
ing palms and ferns. The cardinal flashed
from the gallery rail, from knots of bunt

were blazing.

five miles is a long: way to ride, but the
little country boys and j girls . are going
to make the trip so tliat they can welcome
the President "to their county. All through
the county to-day the , children are prac
ticing patriotic Â¦ songs so that when they
stand in the big depot at Sausalito on
Thursday morning there may be no dis
cord in their choral greeting to the great
President.
It is Â¦ estimated that fully ,1200 school
children w^l be present. . This includes
the cadets of two military academies, who
will also be there with their natty,uni
forms. , â¢ . '
It has been -the especial aim of the re
ception committee to arrange everything
for the benefit of , the children. The
youngsters will have the best of it and
are perhaps the only f ones who will be
close enough Â» to hear what the President
will say, for grown people at Â¦ Sausalito
will not be ' allowed ' inside the depot or
inside the picket fence beyond it. They
will have to Â£e content 'with a peep over
the fence or a Â¦ view -from the hillside.
Sheriff W. P. Taylor : will be there with
his deputies to carry out the arrange
ments made by the committee.
Yesterday many - men were . sent up
among the redwoods to gather greenery for
: decorative purposes. The depot at Sausa
lito will be decorated, also the one at Mill
Valley, where , the President â¢; and : party
will change cars for the trip up the moun
tain-. . The- quaint . tavern at the top of
the mountain â¢ will not be forgotten, and
pretty decorations will grace its walls.
The people of Mill- Valley feel slighted.
The President will change cars there, but
it Is doubtful- if the < people will get a
glimpse of him. The committee has been
unable. to. fix a time schedule for the trip,
owing to the uncertainty as ' to , the hour
the Presidential party will leave the city.
If the party leaves the city at 8:30 they
will arrive in Sausalito at 9:10. This will
allow the steamer to make a little tour
of the waters ' around Belvedere and.
Sausalito. Arriving at the latter place it
is estimated" that the welcome lay the
children, address by Judge Angellotti and
response by the. President, will occupy
fifteen minutes. The run < to Mill Valley
will only occupy fifteen minutes and after
allowing about ten minutes to change cars
the party will start at about 9:50 on the
Mount Tamalpais Railroad for. the sum
mit. , The . run â¢ up will : ra-ke about one
hour and ten minutes. Arriving at the
Tavern at 11 o'clock luncheon and sight
seeing will be in order until. 12:30. when
the return trip will be commenced. There
will be no stops on the return : trip and
the party will land in the city about 3;3O

its highest Cegree when the
President alighted from his
carriage and stepped to the
reviewing stand on the west
side of Van Ness avenue,
between Post and Sutter
streets. Before the signal
from the dome of the Claus Snreckels
building proclaimed that the column was
in motion. Van' Ness avenue, on either
'side, from Market street to Bush, was
lined- with the expectant. The throng
grew in density until the head of the
column- wheeled into the avenue from
Market street. The multitude was good
natured but insistent. A detail of police
under the immediate command of Lieu
tenant Price found it necessary at times
to use gentle force to prevent the throngs
on the sidewalk from crowding against
others who were lined up against the
wire ropes.

McKinley Reviews the Parade.
As the President reviewed the column
of troops he chatted occasionally with
those, at his side. He shook hands with
several ladies who were brought forwar-i.
It was observed that he was punctual in
returning salutes from the passing pro
cession and that he never failed to re
move his hat when the colors went by.
When the survivors. of his old regiment,
bearing the -regimental flag, passed he
bowed in gracious saluation to his com
rades and remarked. "There goes the flap:
of my Â¦ old I regiment." â¢ In his - comments
on the demonstration he spoke of the-or

AH along the line of march there were
many humorous and pathetic incidenta.
As the President's carriage passed
through Third street the little faces that
peered over the wire ropes lighted with
joy and chubby hands were ralr-d and
piping voices cheered the man. of tiie hour
as he passed. Old women and men who
are on the verge of the grave smiled on
and cheered the honored guest. Cameras
clicked from every side and enough photo
graphs were taken to be souvenirs of "the
momentous occasion for a lifetime.
Even the crippled were given an oppor
tunity to watch the grand spectacle. Many
of them were wheeled up to the wire
ropes and watched the magnificent parade
as it passed.
Little Ones See the President.
Mothers guarded their little ones and
lifted them up to see the President and
the children gazed at him in open-eyed
wonder. On Van Ness avenue little or
phans dressed in their dark blue uniforms
and dresses and in charge of kindly Sis
ters of Mercy, silently greeted the distin
guished visitor as he rode by. #
When the President passed St. Ignatius
College, Mayor Phelan called his atten
tion to the Jesuit fathers who crowded
the windows, and he bowed gracefully to
them and they in return waved him a
dignified salute. The President was
pleased with the decorations and gazed
with a pleased eye on the immense pic
ture that surmounted the side of the
structure. The cheering that greeted the
President as he passed the students of
St. Ignatius was incessant.
College Rooters.
General Shafter's heart was gladdened
by the cheers that greeted him all along

salutes given him by his admirers. Con
gressman Kahn occupied a seat in a car
riage and was also given a hearty greet

MY BOY ought to be
here." sobbed a little
old woman yesterday as
the First California
Regiment passed the
Phelan building^ As she
spoke tears coursed
down her withered
cheeks and sobs shook
her aged frame.
"He went with them to Manila and
never returned," she sobbed in answer to
the questions put by those surrounding
her.
The dead soldier's mother was brave, as
such mothers usually are, and endeav
ored to dry her eyes and pay her meed
of applause as the regiment marched by,
but the effect was too much, and she
would have fallen to the ground if by
standers had not caught her. Kindly
hands were extended, and the mother of
a Manila hero was escorted to a doorway,
â¢where, surrounded by strangers, she
sobbed as If her heart was breaking.
She was more than brave, was this lit
tle woman, w~o gave her son to Uncle
Sam, and soon regained her composure.
Smiling gratefully to those whose sym
pathy had enabled her to witness the
comrades of her boy as they massed by,
she asked to be taken again to the edge
of the sidewalk, from where she saw the
rest of the parade. With moistened eyes
and quivering lips she stood gazing at the
blue-clad militiamen as they passed, but
uttered never a word. When the parade
was o\'er she quietly disappeared.
Another patnetlc incident of the march
was presented on Van Ness avenue. Two
young women who were dressed in black
occupied places on the curb and as the
procession passed their ratriotism was ex
emplified in the hearty cheers for the hon
ored visitor. But when the First Cali
fornia Regiment passed, led by their band,
their eyes . filled with tears and they
turned their heads away and wept. The
tears were for a brother who had gone
away with the brave volunteers and met
ROMANTIC WEDDING

Captain Edward Bright and Mrs.
Buckley, Both of San Francisco,

TACOMA. May 14.â In Dawson two
weeks ago was solemnized one of the most
romantic marriages that has taken place
in the Klondike. The principals were
Captain Edward Bright and Mrs. Buck
ley, both residents of San Francisco. A
Dawson dispatch received at Skaguay
says they were wedded at the home of
the Rev. Mr. Hetheriiigton, pastor of the
Dawson Methodist Church, in the pres
ence of several friends. â¢ Both are middle
aged and have knoÂ«vn one another since
childhood, having attended school to
gether.
Mrs. Buckley was formerly the wife of
John Buckley, who in later years became
purser on a steamship commanded by
Captain Bright. Mrs. Buckley sometimes
went to sea with her husband, thus con
tinuing the warm iviendship existing be
tween herself and Captain Bright. A
period of ten years then elapsed before
they met several months ago in Dawson,
where Captain Bright has large mining
interests. Mrs. Buckley had been wid
owed. Their friendship was renewed and
culminated in the wedding. After closing
their Klondike business they will live In

PRESIDENT McKINLSY AT THE REVIEWING STAND ON VAN NESS AVENUE.
5A RECENT discussion in Parliament brought out
certain facts in relation to affairs in Ashantee
which afford a ready made theme and plot for
a rousing romance. It appears the British are eagerly
searching for a golden stool used as a throne by the
ki^gs of the Ashantee tribes and regarded by the na
tives with superstitious reverence. It is believed by
the British that if they can obtain the precious stool
and seat their man on it the Ashantees will accept him
as King and the British will be able to rule them in
peace from that time on.
The stool, however, is lost. "... When last removed
from the royal headquarters two chiefs and two slaves
had charge of it. The slaves were required to bury
the stool, and as soon as'they had completed the task
they were put to death. The secret hiding place of
the sacred stool was then known only to the two
chiefs, but both of- them were killed in recent battles,
and now no one knows where to look for it.
A CHANCE FOR ROMANCE.
Taken at its best the showing is not a pleasant one.
The nations seem to have expended wealth about as
fast as it was created. The' twentieth century starts
rich indeed in the way of all forms of material good,
but with heavy mortgages in the way of- national in
debtedness to.be 'paid off, so that really the nations
are not much better off financially than they were a
century ago.
1882....;.......... ; 26,249,901,000 "
1901 ....31,493,749,000'
It thus appears that the debts of the nations at the
close of the nineteenth century were 1200 per cent
greater than at the close of the eighteenth. During
that period the population of the countries owing the
Â¦debts increased by 150 per cent, and gold and silver,
which form the basis upon which the debts are to be
paid, increased by 300 per, cent.
The- situation, however, is not so bad as. appears
from the face of the figures. The wealth of Great
Britain, France, Spain and the United States in 1800
is estimated at $20,244,640,000; while Mulhall in 1895
estimated their wealth at $195,759,8297660, or practi
cally ten times that at the beginning, of .the century.
The debts of these four nations in 1793 aggregated
but $1,630,270^000, and in 1900 were $11,764,000,000, or
seven times as much as in 1793. If the rate of
growth in wealth which has characterized the four
nations whose growth during the century may be also
properly applied to the world at large it may be said
that the growth of national wealth has about kept
pace with that .of national indebtedness.
x It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that while it is
true the greater part of the huge debt now resting
upon the nations was caused by wars or by the main
tenance of military, or other non-profitable establish
ments, a considerable part of it represents national
improvements in one form or another. The contribu
tions of the United States and Great Britain to the
aggregate indebtedness of the world have been due
almost wholly to wars, but with other nations it is not
so. France has contributed about $4,ooo,ooo]boo, but
not all for war, since some of the debt arises from
state purchase of railroads, a productive enterprise.
The 'German addition has been less than a billion
dollars, and this partly on account of railways. The
Russian addition has been some $3,000,000,000, also to
a material extent on account of state ownership and
construction of railways and other public works.

A New York man whose legs had been amputated
went crazy after being dismissed from the hospital

Southwestern States was held recently in
Kansas City to decide on the part which
club women should take in the exposition
which is to be held -in St. Louis to cele
brate the centennial of the Mississippi
purchase. Eleven States sent delegates.
The Important decision was reached not
to ask for a separate building for wom
en's exhibits, but to place all' articles
manufactured by women, either In facto
ries or at home, in the general classifica
tion. .
Influence That Continually Widens.
â¢ .The success of the World's Columbian
Exposition, especially that Â¦ of the con
gresses auxiliary, was greatly aided by
the enthusiasm of the women's clubs.
They made that exposition an object . of
study while it was in process of construc
tion, attended the various congresses and
returned home to arouse their own com
munities to the benefit and pleasure to be
derived from a visit to the exposition.
When there was a doubt as I to .whether
the President vrould be able to appoint a
woman commissioner to the Paris Expo
sition every president of a State federa
tion sent a petition asking that one or
more women commissioners be appointed,
and the larger number named Mrs. Potter
Palmer as their choice. Also when it was
doubtful if women would be named on the
Jury of award of the, Paris Exposition t the
federation presidents sent telegrams to
the commissioner general urging him to
use his Influence to obtain the appointing
of women' on tbc Jury.
The subject of "Peace and Arbitration"
has been studied in the clubs. ' During
the sessions of the international peace
conference at The Hague a cable of ap
preciation Â¦ and a promise of co-operation
was sent by the board of the General Fed
eration of Womens' Clubs to the dele
gates. ". *\>.'i
During the Spanish American war the
women's clubs took a prominent part in
relief measures and in providing for the
comfort of the soldiers. This was notably
true 'of the Western cities, such as Den
ver, San Francisco, Boise and Salt Lake
City. The clubs in those cities sent com
mittÂ«es to meet the men in transit, pro
vided warm meals and did - everything
possible to secure a comfortable trip for
the soldiers. . . - . â¢ - !
Women's Clubs and World's Fairs. ,
The women's clubs have always thrown
their influence on the side of civil ser
vice reform. At the Milwaukee biennial
meeting of the .General Federation of
Women's Clubs a session was held in
which the subject I was discussed. The
women's auxiliary of the New York Civil
Reform Association recently offered two
prizes, one of $100 and the other of $50,
for the best essay on the 'subject of civil
service reform, the competition to be re
stricted to members of clubs holding
membership in either the general federa
tion or a State federation. The Massa
chusetts federation has a committee on
civil . service, which has organized into
committees in the clubs.
After the murder of Governor Goebel
the "Emergency Association" was formed
in Kentucky, with headquarters in Ltfuis
ville. * In that city alone there are over.
4000 members. Branches are being,rap
idly organized in other cities and towns.
The object of the association, which is
largely comDOsed of women, is "to incul
cate principles of good citizenship, to urge
a single standard of conduct ; for public
and private life and to enforce the laws
against murder, carrying concealed weap
ons," etc Ultimately some of these prin
ciples will affect the "troubled political
life", of the State. '
Civil Service Reform and Arbitration
The Massachusetts ' federation held 'an
important exhibit last April in Boston of
the home industries of the country; â¢ Rugs,
blue and*- white * needlework from ~Deer
field, the weaving of the. Georgia, Tennes
see! and Kentucky -women and of the
Acadlans, together with. the lace, .baskets
and embroideries of the Mexican and In
dian women, were displayed. Altogether
it was a "brave show" and most encour
aging. *
The Women's Club of Central. Kentucky
held last summer an exhibit of arts and
crafts .which was very successful. It
opened a market for the sale .of some of
the curios. and the beautiful weaving of
the mountain people.
This movement has its counterpart In
the "town and country" club> of Minne
sota, Missouri and Kansas: also in the
"summer camps" under the < auspices of
the Kentucky federation. The first of
these camps was started in a mountain
county by four young ladies, who, with
their chaperon, camped out all summer,
teaching the mountain women and chil
dren to sew, to mend, to cut out. to cook
and other simple household duties. The
mountaineers flocked to the camp and
eagerly offered themselves as pupils. Last
summer a ; large number of clubwomen
spent the entire season in the mountains
working on the same lines. Such personal
devotion and good-fellowship must become
a social power and win these shy and sus
picious people into comradeship. -:'V-v'

federation has aroused Interest all over
the State in school sanitation and has
spent in two years over $6000 In decorating
model schoolrooms.
The Louisiana federation, as soon as it
was organized, began to work on civlo
lines. The Shreveport "Woman's Club is
erecting a public fountain. The Woman s
Club of New Orleans is trying to clean the
streets, and the publio is being. educated
by it to a realization of the unkempt con
dition of the cities and villages.
A woman's club of Harriman, Tenn.,
found the sidewalks of the town In a de
plorable condition and . when not abl6
otherwise to Improve them its members
have rebuilt them. I This same club has
offered a prize for the best-kept tenement
house and has placed receptacles for
waste paper in all the publio buildings.
The/ president of the federation of Okla
homa Territory and Indian Territory re
ports that "the pioneer woman is a great
factor in the public movement of a pio
neer-commonwealth-" The clubs of her
federation, she says, are Interested on
civic lines of work. Streets and alleys
have been made clean; trees have been
planted and their destruction prevented;
parks have been begun; cemeteries have
been cared for; schoolrooms have been
adorned with works of art and school
grounds have been tastefully laid out. To
appreciate the full force of this report a
person must be conversant with the diffi
culties with which settlers of new or out
lying States have to. contend.
A unique association has been organized
in Iowa called, the Daughters of Cerea.
The headquarters : of the club is in Des
Moines and thejbrauch clubs are scattered
in the farming districts. The members are
wives and daughters of farmers; it is said
that some of them clnve over twelve miles
to attend the semi-monthly meetings.
They have a system of circulating-librar
ies among their branch clubs, and have
debates on social and economic subjects,
especially on such as Interest rural popu
lations. Â¦.';;-, Â¦Â¦.<,;-; ;>
All the State'federations have appointed
committees on legislative work, the mem
bers of which are selected from different
parts of the State. When a law is pro
posed which must affect the entire State
it is absolutely necessary to secure the .co
operation of the country women as well
as those of the city. Thus" many an object
lesson of the interdependence of town and
country has been taught the club women.-
Some remarkable results have been ob
tained through the efforts of these com
mittees. There is space here to give only
a few examples,' but every State federa
tion has secured some needed legislation.
In Delaware the educational committee of
the State federation and a committee from
the Legislature and the constitutional
convention held many conferences which
resulted in the creation. of. a State board
of education and new and Improved school
laws. Sanitary ; school, conditions were
made obligatory and women were qualified
to vote for school trustees by the payment
of a small property tax, as on silverware,
etc. At the next meetinfe of the General
Assembly of the State a bill will be pre
sented by the federation making school
attendance compulsory, also a bill to cre
ate a State normal school and a bill for
the protection of children on coast ves
sels and Inland waterways. The federa
tion of the District of Columbia during
the first year it was organized secured an
entire modification of; the laws which af
fect the:legal status of . women. As the
district contains the national capital it
cannot fail. to have an important effect on
the legal status of women in all the States
to have the district laws conform to those
enacted by the most advanced States and
thus be in harmony, with* liberal public
opinion. . The committee having in charge
the amendment of these laws went before
the Senate and House committees and
were so well received that they went the
next year and obtained the adoption of
the kindergarten as : a *part of the public
school system of the district. Â¦
i The legislative committee of the Michl-'
gan federation has obtained . the passage
of a^ bill through the Legislature placing
.women physicians in air State institutions
where women and children are held; also
a bill authorizing women to vote in school
elections. â¢ The State federation of'Mary
land is seconding the admirable efforts of
the geological department of Johns Hop
kins University in endeavoring to secure
needed legislation in favor of good roads.

The club life and its interests are prov
ing . a bond of union between the city
women and the country women. JThey are
thereby discovering that their welfare is
promoted by active co-operation; that
they must work together to secure edu
cational advantages, library facilities and
a broader social life. â¢:-"Â¦Â¦*.
In the past the town and country have
held apart, as if they had no common tie.
One of the factors which is pressing these
seemingly: separate Interest is the annual
meeting of each State federation, where
the programme is prepared by a commit
tee selected from all parts of the State,
so no subject is treated from one point of
view and all discussion must take a wiSe
range. The; civic club of a large city, pre
sents a report of its achievements and*
dlfficutles and it may be followed by- a
report from a rural club which has just
secured, by great' effort, a law to estab
lish a village pound and to keep the cat
tle off the streets. r The report of the pub
lic school art societies has aroused a de
sire to improve the conditions of both city
and rural schools, and city and country
women co-operate to this end.
Mrs. Bourland of Peoria, 111., in one of
her drives through the country happened
on a little schoolhouse which appeared
unkempt and most' unlovely. She went in
and found the inside even more neglected;
the teacher, a young man, was interested
in his school and earnest to do all in his
power to help his pupils. He told his vis
itor that she was the first person who had
ever evinced the least interest in' the
school. Mrs. Bourland promised to aid
him and ultimately secured some fine
photogravures to hang on the walls.- The
teacher told her that many of the chil
dren then saw for the first time a work
of art. .
City Women and Country. Women.
In the large cities it was not difficult to
enter public life through the door of edu
cation. The initial step being taken it
was only a question of time when all pub
lic interests would command the attention
of the clubs. The attempt to solve educa
tional problems brought the members face
to face with others equally vital and dim
cult of solutionâ glaring evils. which af
fected the children in each neighborhood,
or the name in which they lived, or the
bread winner on whom the child was de
pendent. Each situation in turn resolved
itself into a discussion which , in time
opened up all the field of industrial
achievement 1 and especially the part which
women and children take-in factory and
mercantile life. The clubs of the large
cities were at onco interested in many
forms of public activity, instituting re
forms, administering charity, Â¦ aiding - In
civic efforts, securing legal protection for
women and children, -placing women In
public institutions where women and
children were confined, amending the fac
tory laws, serving on committees for
tenement house reform; helping to secure
public parks and playgroundsâ in a word,
their interest soon embraced all the large
civil movements.
Even the clubs in the smaller towns and
villages have found a wide scope for prac
tical, effort They have . simple . civic in
stitutfons, Tjiit it takes great' courage to
criticizeHhe members -of ' school boards,
the Aldermen or the Mayor. The members
must use great tact when suggesting that"
any institutions may be improved,. for of
ten ! the town officers are family* connec
tions of some one member and the criti
cism is almost personal. But the neces
sary courage has been . found and rural
districts will improve now that women are
looking out of the doors into the com
munity life.
Taking TJp Other Questions.
.The- primary purpose of the. women's
clubs entirely precludes . the possibility
that they should become, in any sense of
the term, political associations. The clubs
have evinced a great aversion to interfer
ing in political questions or taking any
action In which State or national partisan
issues were involved. They have recog
nized that. the members were representa
tive of all shades of political beliefs and
have avoided all controversy on political
lines. The numerous civic and s'ociologlcal
activities now conducted under the aus
pices of the. clubs have been undertaken
through a stem sense of duty and have
been on strictly I non-partisan lines. ; The
clubs realized somewhat slowly what a
power is association, but once awakened
to a consciousness of the opportunity
which concerted action . gave they were
not slow in putting it into practice by en
tering on a semi-public career. Â¦
At present every department club has
a section devoted to civic action or sociol
ogical investigation. When the clubs first
realized their civic duty the only work
in which they could unite was education,
so a. department or committee on educa
tion was organized, in which was cen-,
tered the study and thought of the active
club members. Most of the clubs inaug
urated practical work on educational lines
by supporting kindergartens until the
school boards of their localities were suf
ficiently educated to incorporate the sys
tem into the public schools. In most of the
cities where this result has been achieved
it was through the efforts v( the women's
clubs, aided by private donations. The
fund which has . been raised recently by
the clubs of. Pittsburg and Allegheny City
to support kindergartens for the children
in the mining districts offers a case in
point, and an example which could be
multiplied by citing the report of every
State federation.

ANSWERS'TO QUERIES
Such is the argument put forward by the advocates
of Panama. Against it stand the reports' of the va
rious commissions appointed by the United States
Government. The issue is complicated by the action
of the Senate in rejecting the Hay treaty with Great
Britain in relation to the construction of the Nicar
aguan canal. It is a big fight, and the sooner it is
fought out the better. The country wishes an isth
mian canal, and is less interested, in 'the route than
in the early completion of'the waterway.
Finally, he argues, it would be folly to construct a
canal across a country so subject to earthquakes as is
that through which the Nicaraguan route passes. He
'cites records to^shpw there has been no destructive
earthquake near Panama in two hundred years', while
there have been numerous disastrous earthquakes on
the very line of the proposed Nicaraguan route within
the last sixty years.
would be equally unsuccessful, and still fewer to en
tertain thejnp.tion that, once 'in possession ofithe canal
Equally; favorable conditions of Vcohtfolf could ]not; ; be
obtained from the Colombian Government as are now
promised by Nicaragua and Costa Rica."
Passing to a consideration of the comparative avail
ability of the two routes for commerce, he maintains
that the slight advantage in point of I distance that
would be gained in a voyage between our Atlantic
and .Pacific coasts - by way of / Nicaragua - as
compared with Panama would be practically lost
by the delay caused, in the passage of the
more numerous locks, the tortuous curves and
the greater length, of the proposed Nicaraguan canaL
The latter would be four times. as long as its rival â
187 miles as against 47/ miles for the Panama canal. ;
As between Atlantic ports and the west coast of South
America the steaming distance, computed on a time
basis, would be less by nearly . seven hundred miles
by way of Panama than by way of Nicaragua, and
Hawaii and all ports of China and Japan would also
be nearer via the former route.

slow to wield it on some occasions when
it would be of immense benefit But their

they will continue to be a potent factor in

MEN all over the country are breathing easier
now that the Wall street cyclone has passed
and blown over only houses of paper.
Time was that such a tempest on the street would
have gone far beyond paper properties, would have
destroyed confidence, depressed prices of staples,
caused a run on the banks and started an industrial
panic
We do not deny that industrial depressions will
occur under any system of finance and any standard
of value, but it is a satisfaction to know that with
everything based on the gold standard a speculative
panic does not project into the industrial field and
produce a panic there. '
The industrial credits of the country rest upon the
gold standard, and even if depression come-liquida
tion, which is the jettisoning of cargo in an industrial
storm, will not be cas destructive as it would be upon
a less solid basis.
In the paper storm on Wall street a great deal of
good money was lost But it was money earned in
the country's industrial operations, to take to itself
wings and fly away in speculation. Speculation is a
luxury. There is none of it when industrial depression
stops the profits of legitimate trade. Men don't specu
late then, just as they don't buy fine raiment, build
fine houses, take fine pleasure tours, or drink fine
wines. But give them legitimate profits of business
and they indulge in all these.
If they lose in the luxury of speculation it is some
comfort to know that they can go back into the
staple market and repair their losses out of legitimate
trade, which they could not do if a speculative panic
were followed by an industrial panic.
It is now quite safe to conclude that trade condi
tions are firm and will continue through the year
without any alarming symptoms, and for this condi
tion we have to thank the improved soundness of our
financial system.

The first of the two objections the professor dis
misses with the statement: "There will be few to be
lieve that because a commission not authorized to
enter into a formal trade transaction was unable to
obtain satisfactory conditions of transfer from the
present Panama Canal Company the United States
By way of explaining why the commission reported
in favor of the Nicaraguan route despite the advantages
of the other line, he says: "The decision of the com
mission is based primarily on two considerations:
(1) The assumed impossibility for th.e United States
to obtain full and absolute control of the rights, and
franchises which are involved in the Panama canal,
and- (2) the belief, unfortunately not justified by the
facts, that the* Nicaraguan 'route has commercial ad
vantages in being the shorter and more direct trade
carrier." .
The most notable of recent contributions to the
discussion has been furnished to the Philadelphia
"Record by Professor Angelo Heilprin, vice president
of the Geographical Society of that city. The pro
fessor warmly advocates the Panama route. He
quotes the report of the Isthmian Canal Commission
submitted last November, to the effect that the con
struction of the Nicaraguan route will cost $200,000,000,
while the Panama canal can be completed for
$58,000,000 "less; ' and, furthermore, that the annual
cost of maintaining, the Nicaraguan canal would be
much greater than that required to maintain the
shorter route. . \
THE ISTHMIAN CANAL PROBLEM.
BY reason of the recent offer of the new Panama
Canal Company to sell its franchise and prop
erty to the United States, and the agreement
of the Colombian Minister at Washington to obtain
the assent of his Government to the transfer, a re
vived interest has been given to discussion of
comparative merits of the Panama and the Nicaraguan
routes. The subject, therefore, will doubtless be ex
tensively debated during the summer, as* Congress
will probably be called upon next winter to finally, de
cide between the two. :".â¢,.-.

President is a genuine expression of the popular ideal
and will. The monarch represents the spirit and pur
pose of one family, and that frequently the least pro
gressive in his realm: . .-.. .Â¦ - .
Every Californian looks upon Jhe President as the
reflection and incarnation of his own best, of his
highest purpose and his ultimate devotion to his
country. San Francisco displays her hospitality in
this spirit. In many important respects the brightest
and most intellectual city on the continent, theimetro
polis sees in the President an image of her highest
thought, in his official career steadfastness to prin
ciple, and in his domestic life a model' that may be
ckerished in every home. i
Therefore his welcome to the metropolis of the
Pacific hemisphere is an expression of the people's
regard for the office he holds, gilded by a warm and
genuine good feeling for the man. One of the most
eloquent and philosophical preachers in this bay re
gion in his discourse last Sunday gave an American
explanation of the reason why our American Presi
dents have all excelled the Kings and Emperors of the
world who have reigned during our constitutional
period. Monarchs are the fruit of a dynasty, born of
unions made for reasons of state. But our Presidents,
have all been the pick and choice of the best branch
of the race. For this reason the average- king has
not risen to the ankles of the average President. Â¦
Now neither can be uttered. President McKinley
has entered upon his second term. He comes as the
representative of what has been accomplished, not
what is expected. This is his time of fulfillment and
retrospect. If his retirement in 1905 shall be broken
by a re-entry into public life it must be by the wish
of his immediate fellow citizens, as in the case 'of the
second Adams. Otherwise he will rest upon his fade
less laurels and pass into his dignified place in history.
In all that has been offered to him in the way of
affectionate and honorable greeting, as in all the ex
pression that is to come, there is on his side and that
of the people a thorough unselfishness. Had he made
the tour at this time last year critics would have said
that it was for the purposes of personal politics, to
gain votes and use public enthusiasm as a partisan in
fluence. And, on the' other hand, it would have been
charged that the people themselves were merely
ing that form of gratitude that has been denned as a
lively 'sense of favors to come, and both criticisms
would have found believers.
A plain man in his life and habits, his public career
has made him an observer and participant in all of the
greatest pageants that have occurred in this country
since the Civil War, from the great review of the
Union army in Washington to the conspicuous '
demonstrations in his .own honor since he, achieved
the Presidency. In the habit of looking upon these
expressions of enthusiasm and good feeling as. if he.
were apart from them, an observer and not a re
cipient, his frank award of the palm to California is â¢
perfectly sincere and does justice to our people. In
the metropolis the scene changes somewhat Else-,
where, the -wealth of demonstration has been a sump
tuous out-bf-door manifestation, the material for
which has been drawn from the contiguous rural
resources of the country. Here we have all that, and
added to it a round of indoor events that bring the
President in closer social touch with the life of our
people.
This is a great compliment to the resources and the
spirit of the people of California, and none. could have
put it in more delicate taste than the President.
I* N his excellent speech- at} San ; Jose President -Me-.
Kinley described the metropolitan welcome and
greeting that have been extended to him and his
party all the way from Redlands to the Santa Clara
Valley, and "yet," he said, "we have not reached the
metropolis."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 15, -1901.
In the course of the "discussion on the subject, -Mr.
Chamberlain said the value of .: the stool is mainly
"moral and intellectual." It appears, however, there
are a good many, people who. think otherwise,- and
accordingly: quite a number of adventurers are roam
ing 'over the wilds of the Ashantee 'forests searching
for . the golden stool. The Â¦ availability of the story'
for romance purposes lies as much in the superstitious'
glamour that surrounds the royal rdic as, in its mone
tary value. 'The days of romance are not' yet over,
and to people who like that' sort of thing a' search for
a golden stool whose possessor can 'command the
absolute .obedience of so many savage warriors is
just as-good a quest as any other. that was 1 ever made
for the. sake of adventure.

Track Notes.
Ruiz, experiences no difficulty in more
than holding his own with the riders now
seen at Oakland. If Barney. Schreiber
starts Bannockburn In the Brooklyn han
dicap "Pi" will have the mount on the
brown horse.
A match race at four furlongs has been
arranged to be decided within ten days
between Wardman and Companion. Pete
Donaleche, owner of the former colt, is
laj'ing Sam Merriweather $500 against $400
that the filly will be beaten. "Moose"
Taylor Is now training Companion.
LONG posted as overdue In racing
circles, Captain Hacketfs big
colt Yellowtail floated into port
an almost easy winner of the
third event at Oakland yesterday.
So often has he disappointed his audi
ences that, with only Rosormonde in her
present ragged form to beat, the ring laid
4 to 5 about the Hackett entry. It is Just
possible the distance â one mileâ may have
had something to do with this luscious
quotation. There was never any doubt
about the result. Ruiz on the favorite
showed first after turning into the back
Ftretch, and always under gentle restraint
finished the string out in 1:40*4. Rosor
njoncle, of course, downed Jim McCleevy
for show honors.
First choices just missed one of mak
5ng a clean sweep of the card. Good Hope
'in the last breaking the combination. The
winners were all well packed and the
becks lost some of the coin they picked
up on Monday. As on the preceding day,
Ruiz, now the star saddle artist, finished
first en three different occasions.
Oscar Tolle. a. colt from the Baldwin
stable, trained by W. J. Spiers, took the
opening sprint at five furlongs. Backed
from 4 to 9 to 5, Alexander hit every post
in front, beating the outsider Rasp with
little to spare. David S, a touted one, ran
into the show.
Before the racing began C. .W. Chap
pell disposed of Faversham for $200 to a
Victoria horseman, retaining the running
qualities of the black horse, however, un
til after the deciding of the second event,
at a mile and 100 yards. Chappell then
bet the money received on Faversham,
Â¦which was backed down from 5 to 2 to 1
favoritism. Ruiz had him. In front all the
way, scoring in a gallop from Sylvan Lass
and Meadow Lark.
Ab Stemler's Goldfinch-Silence colt
Quiet carried the big commissions bet on
the two-year-old dash at half a mile. The
youngster went to the post a 6 to 5 chance,
ridden by Henry Shields, and turned up
a clever winner over Waterscratch and
Sol. The latter had his odds forced down
from 10 to 3. Â¦Â¦ *
Bookmaker Caesar Young's fast horse
Meehanus made.lt three straight by cap
turing the seven furlong purse run. Well
supported at 1 to 2, he showed first al
most from the start, sulxfuing Jim Hale
handily at the wire, McGyle. the second
choice warmed up In a. manner that did
not please the critics, and showed to poor
advantage in the race. Malay was third.
By repeating a former fine performance
over six furlongs Valencienne upset cal
culations in the closing number. After
a warm tip on Dollie Welthoff had cooled
off Good Hope answered post call the fa
vorite. At the start .Fauntleroy rushed
Valencienne for the lead, and despite
Alexander's hard urging the first choice
could never overhaul the. St. Carlo mare,
which stepped over the line In 1:13%. Â£>ol
lie finished third.

L'ITALIA GIVES
WARM GREETING
Market street presented a magnificent
spectacle last night with its myriad of
lights and color. Thousands upbn thou
sands of lights greeted the eye, and the
! effect was so harmonious that it was a
; pleasing sight.' . From the Ferry depot,
| outlined In the pky by incandescent lamps
: to as far out the main thoroughfare as the
eye could reach, it was a blaze of light.-
Nlght was literally turned Into day, and
the countless throng gave the street the
appearance of a city in carnival time. -.
The streets were impassable. People
came down town to see the illumination
and they were repaid with a grand spec
tacle. Borne criticism was made of the
long string of arc lights that shone on
each side of Market street because they
left the center of the thoroughfare in
comparative darkness. . Attention was
called to the street illumination' at the
time the brave California volunteers re
turned from Manila, and many were of
the opinion that the effect was far pret
tier. However, the people were loud In
their praise of the street illumination. The
Ferry depot looked grand from a dis
tance. The tower that surmounts the
Union Depot had been decked with lights
from the top of its flagpole to the base
and was greatly admired. A star of red,
white and blue hung over the tower and
was "in perfect .'harmony with the lights
beneath it. Coming up Market street the
visitor's eye was attracted to The Call
building, which was outlined against the
night by thousands of glittering lights.
The imposing structure never looked
more beautiful. Every line of its grace
ful architecture stood out in bold relief,
and the onlookers could not help giving
vent to their feelings. Every window was
ablaze with light and the thousands who
saw the magnificent spectacle from the
surrounding hills or from far out; on the
water expressed their approval in the
â¢highest superlatives. â¢ '
Opposite the tall structure the Chronicle
presented a striking appearance with Its
vari-colored lights. The building was
beautifully decorated and came in for its
share of praise.- The Hearst building on
the opposite corner was the cynosure of
all eyes. Pendants of colored lights grace
fully hung on the structure and the motto
"We all honor our President" shone out
brightly. .The three morning newspaper
offices, located as they are on the three
corners, made an imposing sight, and the
decorations of the trio were warmly
praised.
All along Market street from Third to
Sixth the merchants beautified their
buildings by tasteful decorations. Elec
tric lights play an important part and the
effect is very beautiful. The dome of the
City Hall as usual presented a pleasing
sight. Llehts outlined the dome, and in
the distance they blended into one vivjd
line of flame. Like the ferry depot and
The Call building the dome was seen to
better advantage in the distance, and the
three tall structures were greatly ad
mired by those who saw them.
The Illumination of the
City Is Dazzling to
the Onlooker.
MYRIAD LIGHTS
IN THE NIGHT
American citizens during the successful trip of
the President from East to West, which hardly
could be equaled by any nation of Europe,
is the best and most evident proof of the
patriotiAn and Infallible bright future of the
United States: It la true that this country
always had the fortune of having at the head
of the nation the most virtuous, honest
and loyal men, who command respect
and admiration; yet our soul is pro
foundly . impressed by the fact that in the
glorious trip of William McKlnley across the
continent all the Â¦ American citizens forgot
political views and parties; they forgot
whether they belonged to the North or the
South, the East or the West, to be all united
in this splendid display of reverence and ad
miration to the chief of the nation. When a
people demonstrates such a wonderful concord
and fusion of thoughts and sentiments it means
that It haa great confidence in its welfare and
will undoubtedly reach the summit that is only
reserved for the audacious and the brave.

Clay Evans passed through this city this
afternoon en route to Chattanooga, u hen
asked concerning a report that he is soon
to succeed Hon. Charles Emory Smith
as Postmaster General,. Mr. Evans said:
Tt-ere is positively nothing in the report.
Mr Emith is a popular official and will remain
In hla present position. I am soinjr to Cnsi 1 '
tanoojra to spend a week looking after private
b-jeiness.
Mr. Evans would say nothing as to
whether he is to Â» remain in the office of
Commissioner of Pensions.
TELEGRAPHIC reports were
received yesterday of a ru
mor current In the East that
Postmaster General Charles
Emory Smith contemplates
retiring from the, Cabinet and
that H. Clay Evans, United
States Commissioner of Pen
sions, is scheduled to supceed
him. The Postmaster General was asked
last night concerning the truth of the
rumor.
"There is no truth in the report, ne
said. "I have not even considered such
a ste?. I think it probable the report
arosefrom the fact that upon the expira
tion of lease upon the house I occupy in
Washington. I did not renew it, for the
reason that I wished to make a change
of residence, but not to leave Washiug-

Admiral Melville, Designer
of the Ohio, Will See
Launching.
The hotel corridors presented a gay and
animated appearance last night. Officers
in full dress Â¦ uniforms smoking, after-din
ner cigars and fair women in handsome
gowns made a pretty scene.
In the Palace Hotel lieutenant T. S.
Phelps, naval aid to the President, at
tracted perhaps the most attention. His
breast was v covered with orders and med
afs. He was, previous to his present ap
pointment, stationed on the coast for^sev
eraJ years, and last night he was kept
busy greeting old friends.
Rear Admiral Georsre Melville was also
around the Palace Hotel lobbies. He is
the designer of the battleship Ohio and
has come out with the Presidential party
to see his fondest dream realized. Admiral
Melville is a venerable man, and has the
appearance of a minister rather than a
seafaring man who has designed a modern
battleship. He is very shy of newspaper
men and modestly refused to talk about
the ship that will dip into the sea on
Saturday.
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson is also
a guest at the Palace. He is accompanied
by his daughter. He takes more interest
in observing orange groves and fruit
orchards than in the imposing duties ot an
officer of state. He says that he is glad
that he took the trip and that he never

worried about the illness in his family
and could hardly be persuaded to leave
his boy's bedside long enough to attend
the reception to President McKinley at

called in ordered the child's retirement to

Congressman Foss of Illinois is chair
man of the committee on naval affairs in
the House of Representatives. 1 He is
pointed out as the next man ,UDon .whom
the folds .of the Senate toga will fall in
his State. He is out here to witness inci
dentally the launching of the battleship
Ohio and at the- same .time inspect the
various naval stations on the coast. He
is pointed out as one of the coming states
men of this country. <
D. \V. Baker, assistant librarian of the
United States Senate, is also at the Pal
ace. He is a young man with a world of
experience in Washington affairs. He is
a quiet man who would pass unnoticed in
a crowd. He holds the reputation, how
ever, of having the latest moves in politi
cal affairs at his finger tips.
Mark Smith, Delegate to Congress from
tho Territory of Arizona, was aJso around
the Palace last night. He is deemed the
moat liKely candidate for the United
States Senate when Arizona is admitted
us a State to the Union. .
The Oregon delegation, composed' of F.
W. Mulkey, M. C. George, George A.
Steel, John H. Hall, J. E. Haseltine and
F. L. Patterson, arrived here yesterday
to see the President. They want the
President to extend the length of his visit
in Portland. They claim that his arriv
ing there in the afternoon and leavfng
the next morning will not give time to
get a good impression of Portland. They
will see Secretary Cortelyou to-day.

SWIFTLY SLIPS
FROM THE WAYS
Launching of Alaskan
Comes Off With
Success.
She Is the Largest Steamship
of Merchant Type
Built Here.
The steamship Alaskan, the largest
merchant steamship ever built on the Pa
cific Coast, was successfully launched last
evening at S:23 from the yard of the Union
Iron Works. Bhe was In a cradle near
the battleship Ohio, that is to be launched
next Saturday. Miss Frances Sherwood
Hopkins broke the bottle of champagne
en the bew as the huge craft began to
slide down the ways and named the ves
seL Attached to the v bottle was a lonsr
blue ribbon on Â¦which were the name of
the vessel, the date and Miss Hopkins'
name. There were present on the plat
form two score ladles and gentlemen,
among the business men being Messrs.
Chesebrough and Dimond of -Williams,
Dimond & Co., the agents of the Ameri
can-Hawaiian Steamship Company, for
which the vessel was built. Superintend
ent Dickie of the ship yard and Mr. Gunn
represented the shipbuilding company.
Just before the launching Miss Hopkins
was presented with a casket containing
a large picture of the steamship, above
which was her own portrait.
A majority of the employes of the
Union Iron Works and many others were
spectators of the launching and many
cheered as the ship went down into the
wa.ter. A powerful searchlight was
turned on, making- her progress visible to
all spectators.
The Alaskan is estimated to be 200 tons
heavier than the battleship Ohio, and she
has a carrying capacity one-half greater
than the Californian of the same line.
Â£he Is of 12.000 tons gross burden, 489 feet
long and 57 feet breadth, with 32 feet
depth of hold. She is for the run between
San Francisco. Hawaii and New York.
From the last named port she will bring
peneraJ merchandise to San Francisco,
from this port will take supplies to Ha
waii and from Honolulu sugar to the At
lantic coast.
ITTIATIIY A CONTXAGBATION.
Gasoline Explosion Sets Fire to Fol-
som and Howard Street Bulkhead.
Tfcere Â¦was a narrow escape from a
serious conflagration at the bulkhead be
tween the Howard and Folsom-street
wharves Monday night. - Had It not been
for the chemical engine on the transport
wharf thousands of ; . dollars' worth of
damage would have been done. A tank
of a gasoline boat was being filled when
a young lad approached the running oil
with an open lantern. There was an ex
plosion and the oil set fire to the wharf.
Lruclnly Third Assistant Engineer Bird
and George Corbett of the transport
Samoa were present and they, with the
assistance of Watchman Russ of the
transport -wharf, got the chemical engine
to the scene and in a few minutes the flre
was out. An alarm was turned in from
box 36 and Chief Sullivan and a chemical
engine responded, but were too late.
In consequence of the flre the Harbor
Commissioners have issued orders that in
future all gasoline boats will have to fill
their tanks at a place remote from much
used wharves.
Movements of Transports.
The Sheridan, with the Forty-fifth ana
Forty-sixth regiments of volunteers,
ehould reach home any day now. The
big: transport is seventeen days out from
Nagasaki to-day and as that Is her sched
ule time, she is now being looked for
hourly. Â¦â¢ *Â¦ '.. 'Â¦Â¦'
The Pennylvania, with the Fortieth; the
Hancock, with the Thirty-first, and the
Buford, with the Forty-first volunteers,
are now out five days. The Kilpatrick,
â¢with parts of the Thirty-eighth, Forty
third and Forty-fourth regiments: the
Grant, with the Forty-eighth and Forty
ninth: the Ohio, with the Forty-seventh,
and the Indiana, with the Forty-second
regiments, are ready to start from
Manila, When the fleet Is all in the last
of the volunteers will be at home.
The biiar freight transport Samoa sails
for Manila, via Pug-et Sound, to-day. She
takes about 5000 tons of general supplies
from this port and will take on board
about 5000 tons more at Seattle. The big

Judge Carroll Cook delivered an im
portant decision yesterday in the habeas
corpus case of Con Ming, a Chinese fish
erman convicted of violating the fish and
game laws by having shrimps when out
of season in his possession. The question
at issue involved the validity of section
C28 of the Penal Code, which was amended
at the last session of the Legislature so
as to protect shrimps among other fish.
The writ was dismissed and the prisoner
was remanded into the custody of the
Sheriff.
DOMESTIC PORTS.
For the defendant it was contended that
the section in question was void, because
of the title of the act purporting to amend
it. To maintain the point; the Judge
said, would be esablishing a precedent
which would compel him, if he followed
his own decision, to hold (if the question
should after July 1 be presentned to him)
that all of the new codes adopted by the
Legislature were void since the titles of
the act adopting them were open to the
same objection made to the act involved.
"While I feel." said the Judge, "that
when the question is presented to ahe
Supreme Court it is probable that that
court will, on the ground advanced, de
clare the acts adopting the new codes in
valid by reason of their titles. I do not
feel Justified in committing myself in ad
vance on a question of such general im
portance throughout the State./ Every
trial court in the State will be called upon
the first of July to pass upon the validity
of the new codes and the question then
can be definitely settled by the Supreme
Court. I will not, therefore, attempt in
advance of a decision by that tribunal to
decide this question, for should I hold the
act to be invalid an appeal would be taken
from my decision, whereas by remanding
the prisoner the question can be at once
presented to the Appellate Court.

WANTS STREETS REPAIBED â¢
IN DOWNTOWN DISTRICT
.
North. Central Improvement Associa
tion Suggests TJse of Movable
r 4 Refuse Cans. :
Secretary Edgar Painter of the North
Central Improvement Association ad
dressed a communication to the Bureau
of Streets yesterday in which he directs
attention. to the fact that various down
town'streets are in urgent need of re
pairs He refers particularly to Leides
dorflf street, where the bitumen is in bad
condition. As the Board ol Public "Works
has expressed its intention to repair bi
tuminized streets whenever necessary.
Painter Tequests that the work In that di
rection be prosecuted 1" in . the district
named. , ' â¢ .
Painter also suggests that the plan or
having dirt cans propelled on wheels for
the cleaning of streets which is.in vogue
in some Eastern cities be put in operation
here. He says that the cans now used
are too small. The refuse is frequently
allowed to remain alongside when they
are filled up and the wind scatters It in
all directions.- Larger cans would obviate
the difficulty and the sweepers would save
time if they were able to move the cans
about as they gather up the dirt, Painter

TRANSFORMATIONS.
Curious Results Wlieii Coffee IMnlc-
ing Is Abandoned.
Tt la almost as hard for an old c,offeÂ«
toper to quit the nee of coffee as it is for
a whiskey or tobacco fiend to break off,
except that the coffee user can. Quit coffee
and take up Postum " Food Coffee with-
out any feeling of a loss of the morning
beverage, for when Postum Is well- boiled
and served with cream, it Is reaJly better
In point of flavor than most of the coffee
served nowadays, and to the taste of. the
connoisseur It is like the flavor of fine
Java,
A great transformation takes place in
the body within ten days or two weeks
after coffee Is left off and Postum Ffcod
Coffee used, for the reason* that the
poison to the nerves has been discontinued
and In its place Is taken a liquid that
contains the most powerful elements of
nourishment.
It is easy to make this test and prove
these statements by changing from coffee
to Pos turn Food Coffee. > ;â¢:Â¦Â¦

Others In the parade were accorded gen
erous cheers as they passed. The Veter
an Guards escorting the four old comrades
of the President, with the colors of his
old regiment in their keepinsr, aroused
much enthusiasm. General Shatter, riding
at the head of the regulars and having
oare that* a generous space was .eft be
tween him and the last of the carriaces,
was cheered all along the line. .
Governor Gage was greeted with cheers
and Governor Nrfsh of Ohio, riding in the
carriage with Gage, was quite generally
recognized and generous applause given

CALEFORHIA HONORS THE PRESIDENT
"The best of it all is." said a sr>ectator
opposite the reviewing stand, "he will be
ecrme one of these days no more than you
or Iâ a private citizen. This dav ought to
furnish the young men who have seen it
the greatest inspiration they have ovor
had."
Cheers for Others in Parade.
sidewalks were crowded to the point of
blockade, and fcg blew in upon crowds un
mindful of physical discomforts so long
as McKinley was in the line of vision.
But the long ride and the chill fog told
upon the President, and when half d the
parade had passed in review he re-entered
his carriage and was driven rapidly away
to the Scott residence, the cheers of thou
sands following him as he rode away.
The parade itself was In, marked con
trast to all others that have marched in
the President's honor since he became
California's guest. Elsewhere a wealth of
flowers delighted the eye, an.l every yro
cession was essentially a floral parade.
â¢San Francisco, aa befits the metropolis of
the coast, the gateway to the new Facinc
possessions and to Oriental trade, had
only military and naval bodies in line.
The President's carriage was unadorned.
The parade moved with a martial swing.
And yet there was nothing in Its sugses
tion i)f other things than republican sim
plicity. People scarcely saw the police
bodyguard, for the unassumlnp, smiling
countenance of the President held their
attention, ' and no one felt that Â¦ barrieus
kept them back from the "heart-touch" of
which McKinley himself speaks oo fondly.

Â¦ showing yesterday In honor of
8 President McKinley. Every vessel
y[ in portwas decked with flags, and
the mail, dock, transport, Oceanic
and Pacific Coast wharves and the Post
offlce building were, beautifully decorated
for the occasion. The ferry building made
no attempt at n display during the day,
but at night it presented a sight worth go
ing miles to see. From thÂ£ top of the Hag
pole to the ground floor it was decorated
with electric lishts in a most artistic and
effective manner.
At the mail company's wharf the steam
ships Coptic and Newport made a fine
showing, while the bark Albert at Steuart
street was gay with bunting. At Fremont
street the South American steamship Gua
temala looked well, while the German^
steamship Denderah at Lombard was*
decked from rtem to stern. At Union>
street wharf the French bark Brenn and
the British ships Eurasia and Dowan Hill
had all their signal Hags set, while the
British bark Dovenby Hall at Harrison,
the Ladakhat Howard and the Lrverpool
in the stream were - pretty sights. The
American bark Kaiulanl at Steuart, the
barker.tine J. C. Pfiuger and the steam
ship Zealandia at Pacific street also
"dressed ship" and added greatly to the
general effect. Kvery foreign vessel was
decorated, and in fact some of them made

were taken back to the warships and the
vessels were got ready for the grand
electrical display of the evening. When
the President reached the ferry building
the electric current was turned on and the

Iowa headed the procession as the. men
marched along Kolsom street to join the
parade at the railroad depot. Fourth and
Townsend streets. With the departure of
the sailors and marines the water front
became deserted as everybody went up
town to Join in the welcome to the Presi

SEE THE NEW COMET
It v.as some time before the crowd
learned of his departure, and even then it
was; useless to do anything but to keep
a footing and drift with the tide. For
hours after the President had left they
.shuffled and then as the guard relaxed
and the crowd thinned, the people climbed
on the platform and dropped into his seat
and were happy. If they had not seen nor
heard. the President they had at least sat
in his chair, and by their smiles and evi-
McKinley watched the seething, writh
ing mass of people for a few minutes and
then he wisely concluded that the best
way to prevent trouble was to leave the
stand, and this he did not forty minutes
after he had entered it. Â¦
: It was a wild scene when the President
raised his hands for silence that he misnt
speak. Far down the "hair seemed paved
with faces, flushed faces and eager ones,
with eyes burning bright in the excite
ment of the crush and lips apart in the In
tensity of the moment. The glow of the
light blending in their many colors threw
an uncertain shimmer over the scene and
hid the distance of the hall in a confused
mass of color and crowds. Tv.-Ice he start
ed and twice he .stopped t>efore the wav
ing of the. flags ceased and the crowd set
tled to listen, and then as he started again
those behind, being just out of hearing,
crushed nearer and nearer until *he warn
ing- shouts began again and the Presi
dent's words were drowned in the turmoil.
Phelan tried to stop the noise, but it was
useless and McKinley's words -ell only
upon the ears of those whom he could al
most touch. He said:
Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens: I wish I
might command fitting- words of response to
the gracious and beautiful welcome extended
to me in behalf of all the people of San Fran
cisco by your eloquent and distinguished chief
magistrate. It is true, as was well said, we
needed no formal or official welcome after the
demcnstratlons to-day, and repeated again to
night as we drove to this assembly hall. I
can only in a single word express the very
treat satisfaction it is to us to feel that you.
irrespective of creed or politics or nationality
or race, give greeting to the President of the
United States. (Applause.) We heard to-day
no note but that of national joy; no song but
that of patriotism: no music but for the union
of the States. We locked upon the faces of
hope and coitentmenl, and I assure you this
splendid manifestation of the feeling of the
people wljl give me encouragement for the
great responsibilities which have been com
mltttd for a time to my care. (Applause.)
Nothing has pleased me more In all this de
monstration than the greeting which 1 re
ceived from the workingmen of this city, from
their hhops and vour streets to-day. I wa.s
Elad to be welcomed by them, by the Grand
â¢Army of the Republic, by my old comrades of
the Twenty-third Ohio and by all the people,
who now have- but one flag, one hope, one
faith, one destiny. (Great and long-coiitinuet^J
applause.)
Crowd Congested.
As soon as the President ceased speak
ing the crowd around the stand was
started down the other side and up again
to the outlet. It had become so
congested, however, that it was a matter
of extreme difficulty;. women were begin
ning to faint on every side. Nearly twen
ty were pulled out of the crush by the
men In the press stand, who reached over
the raii and drew them ur> out of the
crowd. The ambulance corps of the regi
ments on guard was kept busy, and more
than a dozen women were hurried out
into open air by the hospital men, helped
by corporals' guard?.
A Wild Scene.'
San Francisco In the gentler pursuits of

tional and material development of the
country. From the summit of Mount
Tamalpais, almost 3000 feet ' above ; the
sea, you will be Invited to survey our city.
bay and tributary country; our great
park, extending to the shores' of the
ocean shall bid you thither; our tables
bearing the fullness of the- land, will
yield you refreshment; our schools and
universities shall exhibit to you the pro
gress of learning, and monuments In hon
or of labor and m commemoration- of val
or await your dedication.
And now to the object of your visit, Mr.
President, the city which constructed the
Oiympla and the Oregon claims the priv
ilege, which you have graciously granted,
of giving to the sea a battleship which
shall bear the name of your own Stateâ
the Illustrious commonwealth of Ohio, and,
â¢it is out sincere wish and expectation that
her achievements shall be. worthy of the
exploits of her sister ships, as well as the
unusual and auspicious ceremony of her
christening.
We trust that these many evidences of
the growth and power of this American
city, the creation of the pioneers and the
pride of their descendants, representing a
span of little more than fifty years, shall
be pleasing in your eyes. What we have
and what we are is'at the command of our
common countryâ a part of Its possessions,
a fragment, perhaps, of its glory. In this
spirit, Mr. President, you are welcome to
It all: and in a more personal sense, I ask
vou for yourself and Mrs McKinley and
the members of your party to now accept
the hospitality of the hearts and homes
of the people of San Francisco.
At 9:25 the cries of "Here he comes!"
gave way to resounding cheers for Presi
dent McKinley. A long line of carriages
passed through the lane formed by the
troops, and as the Chief Executive of the
nation passed through the soldiers pre
sented arms and the cheering grew deaf
ening. , President McKinley passed up
stairs, followed by his body guard and
invited sruests. When the latter had as
cended the police were practically com
pelled to let down the bars, and men,
women and children surged forward in a
mass and fought their way upstairs. It
was impossible to stop the onward rush.
All the policemen could do was to pre
vent overcrowding, and even in this they
were unsuccessful. Time and again the
crowd became so congested that a halt
was necessary. Those in back were un
mindful of the delay and they surged
forward. Women fainted by the score and
had to be pulled out of the crowd and
cared for. Dresses were torn, hats crush
ed, veils lost, glove* dropped and wear
lnr apparel disarranged in the mad rush
to gt>t a closer view of the President. . .
Dr. Rethers, Dr. Hansen and Sergeants
Bertand, Schwsb, Cottingham and Langer
were constantly busy caring for thofe
who had fainted. Hysterical women were
carried to room 14 and within a short
time it took on the appearance of a hospi
tal. Other rooms were pressed into ser
vice, and the physicians and their assist
ants did excellent work.
Fortunately there were no serious acci
dents. There â¢was every danger of one.
but the committee on arrangements so ar
ranged the interior of the nave that the
surging mas? of people entered through
one passage and went out through an
other.
G. W. Magwood, residing at 139 Taylor
The President Arrives.
Major Bush commanded four batteries
of the new First Artillery, N. G., and the
work of his men deserves commendation.
The first troop of cavalry in command
of Cautain Charles Jensen was also
early on the scene and did effective -work.
An Immense crowd congregated in front
of the ticket offices of the Oakland ferry
and pressed forward in the hope of caus
ing a stampede, so that ail those close to
the stairway could rush upstairs. Their
effort was foiled by Lieutenant John Mar
tin, who sent a dozen husky policemen in
their midst, and by a judicious use of
their clubs quelled the small-sized college
rush. However, before the officers could
get around to those in the back a number
of women fainted and had to be carried
out and restored to consciousness. The
crush was so great during the night that
more than thirty persons succumbed and
had to receive medical care.
Captain Wittman saw that sterner
remedies were necessary . and he called
upon the military. The soldier boys took
to their work with a will. They prodded
the people with the -butts of their guns
and forced them back by sheer weight of
numbers. Entire companies were neces
sary to carry out the orders, but the
heroic work was effective.
At first the crowd formed a semicircle
in front of the depot. A passage being
necessary for the oncoming Â¦ hacks a
number of cable cars were sent through.
Cavalry was dispatched to the scene, and
by clever horsemanship and a show Â» of
mild force the immense throng was forced
to take different sides of the street.
Calls Upon the. Military.
During the long wait for the President
the police and Â¦ tiddlers were kept busy.
As early as 6:30 p. m. .the crowds begin
to gather. Wire ropes were stretched in
every direction and the early arrivals took
up places of vantage. For the next three
hours the people simply surged into East
6treet. Every car to the ferry and every
boat brought its countless numbers and
within a short time the street was black
with people. The cars were stopped
about 7:45 and an effort was made to
press the people back on either side of the
street, but without avail. The sidewalks
and streets were jammed and those in
the back ranks, unmindful of the shouts
and appeals from those who were being
pressed against the ropes, swayed for
ward. The police strove hard, and in
their effort to control the mob they lost
their hats, stars and tempers.
President McKlnley and escort dfo not
arrive at the ferry depot until 9:25 p. m.
His late arrival created no end of
trouble for the Police Department. It
was powerless to handle the immense
crowd that congested the streets leading
to the depot and the officers had to call
upon the cavalry and militia to aid, them
in keeping the people In check. -Wire ropes
had little effect in hold^the people back.
They were there to see the President and
they crushed, jostled and pushed each
other until the scene became almost in
describable. Captain Â¦ymtman had a
large sauad of officers on hand, as did
also Captain Dunleavy. but their united
forces were a mere bagatelle and but for
the presence of the military ' the nave
would have been overrun before the dis
tinguished guest arrived.

o'clock to-night with the crowning of
Queen Mary. Mayor Hanford presented
her. Majesty with the golden key of free
dom, and the city of. San Bernardino was
. given over to merry-making. After* the
; l coronation a cake walk, in which twelve
little girls participated, was given on the

SAN JOSE. May 14.â Flora's tribute
to the nation's chief to-day was
an elaborate one. Although the
President could not be here to see
it, the acres and acres of blooms
grown for his greeting were brought for
vard â¢ and used in welcoming the thou
pjnds of visitors* who flocked to San Jose.
IVbUe some of the enthusiasm pent up
:Mid awaiting the' appearance of President
McKlnley was lacking, the carnival of
roees was not the less grand.
Many country people had delayed their
visit here to see the President until this
morning and these -were disappointed.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 15, 1901;
would not be here came so late that it
was not advisable to change the hour. At
7 o'clock the country people began to ap
pear on the streets and when the great
floral parade began its line of march fully
15,00i) visitors were in the city. ,
Photographs for the President.
The Cabinet officers felt they could not
wait to see the offering of the people and
at 9 o'clock left for Palo Alto. However,
I a couple of the prettiest floats were taken
j to the depot for/ them to see and the
guests expressed surprise at their beauty
and grandeur. The floats, arches and all
] decorations will be photographed and the
i photographs presented to President Mc
1 Klnley in a handsome album.
J The carnival now in progress is the
â¢I greatest, floral display ever witnessed in
j Central California, even surpassing the
great rose carnival held bere six yeard
ago. Never before have flowers been so
plentiful and so tastily and profusely ar
rayed. St. James Park, with' Its eight
floral arches and the mammoth Presi
dent's bouquet, presents a magnificent
Bight. In it the beauty of the surrounding
country Is centered, for each section con
tributed an arch, and each tried- to outdo
the ethers. The same rivalry existed ln
the districts and schools furnishing floats
1 and when their work of weaving nature's
beautiful gifts Into artistic designs was
displayed this morning It was hard to de
cide which was the' prettiest.
When the parade started the streets
were crowded. Chief of Police Kidward,
with Chief Hodgkins of Oakland, drove at
the head with a double team attached to
a prettily decorated rig. A squad of police
followed. Then came Grand Marshal
Cash and his aids. The Flfjih Regiment
Band headed Company B. National Guard
of California. Mayor Martin, Director
General Greenlnger and others followed in
carriages.
The San Jose High School presented
"Progress of Knowledge." It represented
the parts played by the different nations
and peoples in their progress in educa
tion. There were three platforms. On the
first were the Arab, Moor, Greek, Egypt
ian and Persian In costume ; above were
Art. Music, Science'and Liteurature, and .
above these Liberty.
"Music" was the theme chosen by the
Horace Mann School. On a mound Â»of
rrses ln the center of the float stood Ian
immense lyre made of red roses, while
the body of the float was a mass of ftow
ers. Each of the four corners had a pillar,
surmounted by small lyres. , A floral mu
sical staff, with clef, notes and bars, sur
rounded the . base of the float. General
Jacqueminot roses were' used principally
in the floral decorations. Maud McKay,
Gretchen Kepple, Lorma. Donnelly and
Lydia Custner, pupils, were attired in
crimson Grecian robes and carried floral
musical instruments. Henri Hill and Ru
dolph Kocher, attired in crimson togas,
were bugler and herald. -"â¢ "*.
Two floral bunnies drawing- a chariot ln
the shape of a broken egg shell were the
tribute East San Jose had prepared. Â£.11
was done in marigolds, and it was one of
the prettiest in line. On the float were:
Queen, Alba Milroy: fairies â Violet Smith,

Medical Bulletin Cites Remarkable
Gtires by Paine's Celery Compound.
'"I have never known a remedy equal to
Paine's. Celery Compound," writes Dr.
Wm. H. Vail, visiting surgeon to the St.
Louis Mayfield Sanitarium, in the Hos-'
pital Bulletin, of which he is the editor.
"It builds up weakened, Irritated nerves,
increases the nervous force, keeps the
liver, kidneys and stomach in healthy ac-
tion, maintains the body free from harm-
ful humors, cures debilitated and exhaust-
ed conditions and prevents the breaking
down of the nervous system.
"The great causes of wornout nerves are
worry, business anxieties and overwork,
which impair the vitality of the system,
and cause disordered liver, weak kidneys,
indigestion, dyspepsia, melancholia, nerv-
ousness, < headaches, exhaustion, neural-
gia, heart disease, paralysis, insomnia,*
rheumatism, pains and aches all over the
body and a host of other derangements.
- "I have thoroughly tested Palne's Celery
Compound and know Its efficacy. ' Jt ad-
vise all persons who are at all r,un dorwn in
health to nourish and strengthen the
nerves by the use of Paine's Celery Com-
pound â no matter what the cause of the
nervous condition may be, nor how se-
rious the disorder is.
"I have treated many obdurate cases of
disease â¢which promptly yielded to Palne'B
Celery Compound, and which made most
marvelous recoveries in a very short time
after I had prescribed this effective rem-
edy." r*';
Palne's Celery Compound Is not a patent
medicine. - '
No class of professional men axe more
conservative, more careful ln giving- ad-
vice," nor more painstaking- in finding
but the real facts of a case tban physi-
cians. â¢
â¢ "When doctors of known repute not only
prescribe and use, but also carry horn*
Paine's Celery Compound for their own
families, there can be no doubt of its higi
standing in the eyes of medical men In

The Weather and Crops.
The report of A. G. McAdie, section director
of the cltmate and crop service of the Weather
Bureau, for the week ending Mcnday, is as
follows:'
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The temperature has been nearly normal
along the coafct during the week, with consid
erable cloudiness and heavy fogs; in the Inte
rior hisher temperatures have prevailed with
generally clear eky and light winds. Light
Fhov.ers have fallen in the southern portion.
Conditions have been favorable for the growth
of all crojis.
As a result of the heavy rains of last week
the condition of grain has been materially
improved, and there will doubtless be abun
dant <-!â¢Â¦ i'K of wheat and barley in the Sacra
mento and San Joaquln .valleys, ' with probably
nearly an average yield In other sections ex
<t-pt Southern California, where the long dry
:-jÂ» :i blighted late sown wheat. Late hay and
j^Murate also chow the beneficial effects of
U-.t- tain and the damage to cut hay is cald
to be ll;ht. Green feed 1e again plentiful in
most sections and stock are looking well. Hops,
corn, beans and t-ugar beets are thrifty and
Fhow indicatione of a good yield. The sell is
in good condition for cultivating and consider
able work is being done in the fields.
Reports at to the condition of deciduous
fruits are still somewhat conflicting, but
there wnt no doubt that the yield for the
Mate will be aLundant and in some sections
fcjuul to tin- average. In portions of the Santa
Clara Valley and in some parts of Alaineda,
Hcncma and other counties the damage by
April froÂ£t6 was most serious and there will
l~- lislu crops of apricots, prunes and cherries
In thoce localities. The season has been very
favorable for citrus fruits und walnuts.
SACRAMKNTO VALLEYâ The weather has
l.i 'â¢!! generally clear and warm during the
wm k and' crops have made rapid growth.
Oraln shows jilainly the benefit derived from
the recent heavy rains and an abundant crop
Â»e*ma amur^d. Hay and pajturage were also
greatly benefited. Haying Is progressing and
th* yield and quality are said to bÂ« excellent;
tli* damage t>y the rain was very light. Hops,
corn 4nd alfalfa are in good condition. Pros
rnfts continue joed for an abundant yl*ld of
nerldunua frultn in in >t auctions, The aeuson

Nci'j York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, May 14.â The inherent weakness
of the stock market after last week's severe
shock to confidence became obvious to-day, and
some violent declines were caused by a com
paratively light volume of liquidation. The
weakness was apparently due to the fact that
the natural rebound after the panic had ex
pended itself. The factors which caused that
rebound were elements of weakness at the
higher level of prices. For instance the pro
fessional operators who were so fortunate as
to secure stocks that were sacrificed at the
low level- en Thursday were very willing Â¦ to
sell and take profits when they perceived that
the rebound had about reached Its limits.
There was another class, that of the insiders
and friends ' of various stocks, who bought
heavily on Thursday to support their favorites
in order to protect their value* as far as
possible. ' This class was anxious to lighten its
holdings when the panic was checked and took
advantage of the high level of prices. There
v.xs a large amount of belated liquidation also
in to-day's market, on the part or the capital
ists and operators who were strong enough
to hold through the panic and save their prop
erty from absolute sacrifice, but who were
nevertheless bent on liquidation. The Satur
day holiday was taken advantage of all
through the Wall-street district to â¢ bring ac
counts to date and the weak condition disclosed
in many cases prompted the closing out of
these accounts. This factor would have had
more Influence yesterday had it not been for
the encouraging effect of the favorable out
come of the London settlement. The bears also
resumed their aggressive mood to-day and not
only offered prices down to take the market
away, from those seeking to liquidate, but
were Industriously: circulating alarmist rumors
of the further consequences to ensue from the
conflict In Northern Pacific. It was observed
with apprehension, as indicating a possible
spread of hostilities to a general stock market
warfare, that brokers usually supposed to be
backed by Standard OH Interests were, sellers
of so-called Morgan stocks, while the sup
posed Morgan brokers were In evidence when
the stocks in the Southwestern group began
to give way. This might easily have been a
bear maneuver, but It was effective In driv
ing prices downward. There were whispered
about the exchange also rumors of a new ele
ment of disturbance in the Union Paelflo Â»lt
uatlon. The stock whs mont prominent In the
market all day, und its violent break after a
period of strength was an etTectlva Influence
in unsettling the whole market. The Hdlinc
was seemingly for tho aucount of Innidttrn,
Judging from tha agenta employed In execut
ing orders, and very Urge ndiing orders in
this Â«nd In other Western railroad stocks camo
from that portion of the country through Chi
i-hu'i, H.iMnii whs also actlv* on the polling
side. With the obvious tendency of th<t, mar
ket to yield, the Investment buying which has
been more or less In evident** for the last day
or two was largVly withdrawn In the hope of.
irettlnK storks later at lower prices. It was thÂ«/
prevailing belief In the mnrket also that the.
powerful operators, Including thÂ« most con
Â¦plcu&UH 011* uf Dm eruup who were so Ionic
foremost In the bull mniket, hail turned in thn
bear side anil wt<rÂ« setllriK freely. Whatever
lite causes nt work It was clcnr that the buy
ing ilrtimnil for stocks had fallen in Insignifi
cant proportions, and the liquidation even of
comparatively light lines mused sudden and
rapid melting awny of valurn. Thrre wrre In
tervals nit the down grade of 1, 2 and even S
points t*-twpÂ»n unlei. A scrutiny of the price
rhntigfs of the day will reveal not losses from
3 to 6 points for a. large number of the prln*

Irlmi'l 6. The money market was not an in
fluence, as there was no large demand for call
loans. Jn fart people were mostly converting
securities into money us rap4dly its possible.
For the same reason the growing difficulties
of the foreign money situation and the belief
that it will draw largely on New York's money
supply was viewed with lessened apprehen
sion. The coming Installment of the British
war loan, the expected issue of the Russian
loan In Paris and the embarrasgrnent feared
/or the London market by the withdrawal of
the French credits are expected to result In
a considerable movement of -.gold from New
York, notwithstanding tile easier tone of the
exchange market to-day.

after an early show of strength. Total sales,

The dealer whose difficulties I mentioned in

ler.'He resigns his membership as a condition
to the arrangement of his accounts by thaSh-e
ferring committee's decision of yesterday in
Northern Pacific. I have learned that the most
important, arbitraeeurs 1 stand to lose some
three-quarters of a million pounds and a com
mittee of them say they would do naught un
less some special steps were taken in their
cases.
The call money rate was 2% per cent.
CLOSING.
Dead silence prevailed In the stock market
here to-day, a state of things In romarkahlo
contrast with the recent yells of exultation a:id
profit. The stagnation Is universal and the tone
Is h<Â»nvy and depressed. Jobbers refuse to deal
until the settlement is over.
Americans are not traded in at all practically.
Such market as there Is is simply an arrange
ment of accounts which are completed by sales
for weak men a or 4 points below the ruling
prices. No big failures are expected now, how
ever.

at 71'4c to 71Â«4Â®71%c. â¢ Offerings were mostly
local holdings. Kenprts of damaged crops in
tho West, Southwest and Northwest from con
tinued'dry weather nave an impetus to the
bull clement to begin buying and the opening
decline was 'speedily rhecked. Then began an
upward movement, caused by buyers. The
lulk of tho traJIny. however, was by those
who hfcd sold on the opening depression. The
price gradually advanced to 72Hc when reports
of rain in Oklahoma and. predictions of rain
In Southern Kansas i farted a reaction. The

Tie lower at 71Q71V4C. . ...

Milton Leads the Grand
March.
?
Able seamen and commanders rubbed
elbows last night at the ball given by
the ship's crew of the Wisconsin at Na
tive Sons 1 Hall. Fair women and gullant
j^ckies went through the mazes of the
dance with great enjoyment. While the
entertainment was essentially a dance
piven by the sailors, conventionality was
for the nonce abandoned, and young lieu
tenants, ensigns and cadets from. Annapo
lis met the "men behind the guns" on a
footing of comradeship, not to say equal
ity.
At 9 o'clock Secretary of the Navy Long
arrived and for an hour participated In
the dances and festivity. Officers from
the Wisconsin. Philadelphia and Iowa, re
splendent in gold laco and professional
disrnlty, danced opposite the humblest
sailors of the fleet and their best girls
from all points of the compass.
Promptly at SÂ»:30 o'clock 200 couples
ranged themselves for the grand marcl:,
â¢which was led by Captain Relter of the
Wisconsin and Mrs. Milton, wife of Com
irander Milton. The band from the train
lug- ship Pensacola, accompanied by a
Ktrtssed orchestra, played, and until the
small hours the revelry was at its height.
Succeeding the irrand march the notable
pu<-.Â«ts of the sailors took partners for the
larcers.
Secretary Long, dancing with Mrs. Lieu
tenant Wiley, was a conspicuous figure
In the center group of the ball and went
through the intricate measures of the
dance with the grace of the nimblest vo
tary of Terpsichore. Opposite the Secre
tary was A. A. Watklns, president of the
<'hamber of Commerce, while Chief Ma
chinist Collins and Able Seaman Pete
<J;i.n~ney, with pretty partners, shared the
honors of the distinguished square.
The hall was a glittering mass of color
p.nd while the refreshment fount in the
l>usenj<mt had a busy time Dan Shea,
chief master at arms of the Wisconsin,
pplit the time very diplomatically by
Keeping his charges on the floor a greater
portion of the time. The entire comple
ment of officers from the Wisconsin at
tended the ball, many of them accom
panied by their wives, and many came
from the *Â»ther warships now in port.
Commander Milton performed gracious
ly the arduous duties of master of cere
monies and the various committees of
seamen managed the floor and reception
of the guests in a most hospitable man
ner.
Among the naval ofHcers present were

Little Boy's Remains Dragged
From Slough by C.
Miller.
SEARCHERS FIND BODY
OF LOUIS HENRIOULLE
The search for the missing boy, Louis
Henrioulle, the account of whose disap
pearance was published in Monday's Call,
was brought to an end yesterday by the
rinding of the body by one of the search
ers in Alvarado Slough.
l^ate yesterday afternoon the father
received a telephone message informing
him that shortly after noon the body of
his boy had been recovered. Charles
Miller, a cierk for Mr. Henrioulle, had
been dragging the slough since the boy
had been missed and yesterday morning
his efforts were rewarded; After a few
hours' work along the slough the grap
pling hooks caught, and as they were
pulled up the remains of the missing boy
were brought to view. Just as the i>ody
reached the surface it slipped from the
hooks and sank again to the bottom.
After a few moments, however, it came
to the top a few feet away and was se
cured.
The place whc*e the remains were lo
cated is but a dozen yards from the ark
where the boy* was last seen alive. Cir
f-urristanees confirm the theory' of the
father that the boy got into the small
boat at the ark, and, losing his balance,
tumbled into the water head first. The
water at that point was at the time not
high enough to reach the boy's head, and
it is probable that in falling he made
a slanting dive, which brought him into
one of the deep holes, where he drowned.
Mr. Brown, who was -at the ark at the
time of the accident, said that the boy
had stepped out of the boat and was
about to come aboard of the ark. Brown
went below and after waiting some time
came on deck again to look for the little
fellow, but could find nothing of him.
When Mr. Henrioulle was apprised of
the finding- of the body he sent a launch,
which he had engaged to assist in the
Fearch. to bring it to Oakland to await
the action of the Coroner of Alameda
County.
Louis was about 14 years of age and
â¢was a member -of Adams Cosmopolitan
School, on Eddy street, between Van Ness
avenue and Polk street. As yet no ar
rangement has been made for the funeral.

Illiugsworth, probably believing him
dead, gathered up his blankets and pro
visions and left. He was trailed twelve
miles, having reversed his route entirely
and going toward Redding, when the
trail was lost in the wild mountain re
gions.
According to Behrens the battle was
a fierce one. He ran toward Dorland, al
leged to be the more dangerous of the des
peradoes, and kept him covered. When
bullets began to pierce his clothing, as
they did live times, he realized he was
the target of Illingsworth, who was se
creted in the bushes. Illingrsworth had al
ready fatally wounded Walker, who was
a close second in the charge. Behrens
turned his rifle on Illingsworth but as
soon as he did so he felt a bullet tear
through the side of his coat from the rear.
It came from the revolver of Dorland,
who had opened fire the instant the Sher
iff's attention was diverted. Swinging
around, the officer sent a bullet crashing
through the body of Dorland, killing him.
Shielded by the body of Dorland, behind
which he lay, the Sheriff exchanged fif
teen shots In all with Iilingsworth. His
ammunition exhausted, he jumped up and
ran for his life, but was felled by a bullet
lrom Illinssworth. It struck a pair of
handcuffs in tht Sheriff's back pocket and
rendered him unconscious, although not
seriously injuring him.
REDDING, May 14.â Sheriff Behrens ar
rived in Redding this morning after hav
ing ridden all night, and gives details
of the encounter three miles north of
Adin, Modoc County, on Saturday morn
ing between officers and escaped prison
ers, which resulted in the death of Con
stable "Walker of Alturas and fugitive
Dorland. Behrens says that but for the
cowardice of a man named Stanley, whom
he took out from Slsson to assist in the
chase, he would have taken Illingsworth,
the comrade of Dorland, either dead or
alive. He says Stanley never left a spot
100 yards from the desperadoes, from
whicli a running charge was made by
Constable Walker and himself.
SHERIFF TELLS
OF THE BATTLE
LOS ANGELES. May 14.â It was given
out positively to-day from a quarter
which is exceptionally well informed that
an attempt is to be made by tne opposi
tion to Governor Gage to crystallize the
opposition throughout the State, and Los
Angeles has been decided upon by. those
having the anti-Gage movement in hand
as the key to the situation. Governor
Gage's real opponent is to be Thomas,
Flint of San Benito, president of the
Senate, who, after mature deliberation,
has decided to enter actively Into the con
test for the gubernatorial nomination.
Senator Flint, it will be remembered,,
visited the city recently as one of the
delegates to the Grand Parlor of the Na
tive Sons, of which order he hns always
been a prominent member./ It was while
he was here that a meeting of a select
few anti-Gage leaders was held. At that
gathering Flint is said to have been asked
point blank whether or not he would be a
candidate for Governor, and he is said to
have replied., after considerable hesitation,
that he stood ready to make an active
canvass.
Senator Flint was then assured that he
would be supported in this city and
county to the extent of the combined
anti-Gage local strength, whatever that
might be, and the battle for supremacy in
this city and county may be said to be on.

but he Is confident the Shamrock II is the
better boat and thoroughly believes some
thing has gone wrong. He is anxious to
see her in the drydock.
It is just possible that the Shamrock I
may cross the Atlantic, but Sir Thomas
Lipton does not entertain any Idea of sub
stituting the old one for the new boat in
tho cui> races, being certain Mr. "Wat
son's creation, in the long .run, will prove
superior to Mr. Fife's.
NEW YORK, May 14.â According to tho
deed of srif t" of the America's cup to the
New York Yacht Club, It would appear
that the Shamrock I cannot be substituted
for the Shamrock II in this year's con
test for the America's cup. One clause
of the deed of* gift reads: "No vessel
which has been defeated In a match for
this cup. can be again selected by any
club as its representative until after a
contest for it by some other vessel has
intervened, or until after the expiration
of two years from the time of such de
feat." ; .'..
The necessary two years have not
elapsed. The Columbia and the Sham
rock I met October 16, 17 and 20, 1899. and
the next series of races were* scheduled
in the acceptance of the challenge for
August 20, 22 and 24 of this year, or a
week later if anything should happen to
delay the challenger. Consequently, It
seems the two-year condition cannot be
made available until after the next series
of races.
Lipton Is Confident That New
Boat Is Better Than
the Old.

' It was decided that all workers '. in machin
ery and allied metal trades should demand a
nine-hour day without reduction in pay before
May 20, the same to go into effect on that
date. The officers of the organizations de
cided that the men in their respective trades
would stand by each other In the enforcement
of the demand should It become necessary to
cease work. In view of the encouraging reports
received from a large' number of employers In
trades having already notified their employes
of concession to the foregoing demand, no
serious opposition to the movement is antici
pated.
The conferences was held at the head
quarters, of the Federation of Labor and
lasted rearly all day. At the conclusion
of the conference President Gompers gave
out this statement:
There was another conference here to
day of irepresentatlves of the various or
ganizations directly Interested in the pro
posed strike. The conferrees Included
Samuel Gompers, president of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor; John.Mulhol
land, president of the International Asso
ciation of Allied Metal Mechanics; James
O'Connell, president of the International
Association of Machinists; Â¦ I* R. Thomas,
president of the Pattern Makers' League
of North America, and E." J. Lynch of the
Metal Polishers', Buffers', . Platers-'- and
Brass Workers' Union of North America.
It Is possible that the strike may be averted.
In 'view of the large number of employers who
suddenly consented to adopt the time and pay
schedule we are striving for. The responsi
bility now rests -with the employers. We have
given them ample time to consider the sub
ject, and I am glad to note that many of
them are prepared to concede that our cause
Is not unreasonable, although It may be dis
tasteful from their point of view. As I said
before, we have closed our side of the case
and now await further action from the other
side.
We have made our final declarations and we
propose to rest our case where It now stands,
and any overtures for calling off the strike
must come from the other side. Our demands
have been presented in a straightforward, bus
iness-like way, and many of the employers are
beginning to realize that we are In earnest
and also that our demands are not only rea
sonable, but just So far as we are concerned
there Is no change in the situation to-day.
We are reinforced by all of the trade organi
zations of the country, and the order for the
strike to begin next 1 Monday will be carried
out unless the opposition yields to our de
mands. .

to reports given out here to-day by lead
ers of the threatened strike of the Inter

holder has received a copy of the reports as
Issued from time to time and haa read therein
that which has added to his confidence In the
company and tha properties. While the reports
are Intended primarily for shareholder*, we
are willing the world should read them. The
Montezuma Company haa no secrets. It I*
willing and even anxious that the light of day-
be turned upon Its properties- and its business
management. The report follows:
OFFICE OF MONTECTJMA MINING CO.
TACOMA. Wash., April 8, 1901.
To the Stockholders:
Agreeably to the Intention expressed In my
February letter, to from time to time issue
a report on the progress of the Company, it
gives me much pleasure to state that the last
60 days have been very prolific In develop-
ments.
COPPER PROPERTIES.
The night and day shifts at our Tacoma
Group of Mines have been doing good work.
We are Just in receipt of the first report, since
the date of my previous letter. The tunnel
Is now in 140 feet, the ore has been classified
and placed on the several dumps. The Su-
perintendent sent in three samples of -ore from
three separate places in the tunnel, a copy
of the assays of which I herewith submit.

Please note that the assayer's test shows
that our No. 3, which is concentrating, would
concentrate 5 into 1. which would give the con-
centrates a value of $196 45 per ton. from
which a small allowance would have to be
mads for a loss in the process of concentra-
tion, if water is used; but it Is our present in-
tention to concentrate by smelting. In which
event the loss would be very small.
I might here add that while groins; In on
the "Tacoma Mine" tunnel, each miner is tak-
ing out per day approximately $20 00 worth of
ore and putting it on the dump. 'VSSe have to-
day several thousand dollars' worth of this on
the dump, and this, while simply doing tunnel
work, shows the great richness of the Tacoma
Mine.
Our force on this property has Just been
doubled, and by the first of July we antici-
pate having a compressed air plant aad power
drills in operation.
The five feet of snow reported at our copper
properties will delay the starting of work on
the Chicago and Blue Star Groups until some
time in May.
COAL MINES.
Since my last report In February we have
been constantly at work with a crew of over
30 men and can .report satisfactory progress.
We have opened up on the 'surface S veins
of coking coal; one 11 feet wide, one 8 feet
wide, one 7 feet wide, one 4% feet wide, one
3 feet widÂ» and one 5 feet wide. By the aid
of this development we have been able to lo-
cate two permanent drifts which will crosscut
the strata and develop the 14 veins known to
exist on our property. . â¢ .'
A wagon road from Fairfax to the mine has
been completed, and we now have on the
ground a water wheel, air compressor and
power drill, which will be In operation during
the present month. We have a sawmill also
upon the ground which is being Installed and
which will be in operation this month.
â¢' We are now driving entries on the coal and
pllinE the coal up ready for shipment in May.
RECENT PURCHASE. .
We have just purchased 1G0 acres of coal
land, adjoining the property we are operating,
and which will be worked through, the same
entries. The land is covered -with the finest
of fir and cedar. This property belongs ex-
clusively to our Company and Is a very valu-
able piece of land. Sincerely yours,
(Signed) C. W. THOMPSON, President.
KEEP ABREAST OF THE TIMES.
There is Indisputable evidence that an era
of great prosperity Is dawning for the Pacific
Coast. Representatives of rich Eastern syn-
dicates are traveling the length and breadth
of the Coast for the purpose of determining its
resources in the base minerals such as cop-
per, iron and coking coal. These representa-
tives have suceeded . beyond their most san-
guine expectations, as the following extract
from the New York Commercial will testify:
"For several months past representatives of
strong New York syndicates have been looking
over the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Alaska,
examining in the most critical and thorough
manner the iron ami coking coal deposits in
order to determine the possibility of establish-
ing furnaces, rolling mills, plate and structural
works on Puset Sound. Doubt was expressed
by Eastern associates regarding the ability to
find iron and coal in sufficient quantity and
of the right quality for a large plant. But
that doubt ia now dispelled. They have se-
cured the San Ysidro Iron mines in Lower
California, where expert examination shows
20.000.0CO tons of ore cropping above ground.
They have found laree Iron deposits in Wash-
ington. British Columbia and Alaska, all with-
in easy distance of tidewater. They have been
equally successful in locating coking coal in
large quantities, accessible to tidewater and
cheap transportation. Thi3 coa! makss coke
.equal to that produced at Ccnnellsville. Pa.
These coal fields are in the vicinity of Seattle
and Tacoma. and a number of mines have In-
stalled plants and are supplying coke to smelt-
ers and foundries. The New Yorkers have dis-
covered that they can produce pigiron and steel
billets as cheaply on Pug-et Sound as they are
produced in Pittsburg or Birmingham, and have
as profit the $12 per ton charged for trans-
portation across the- continent. The consump-
tion of -iron on the Pacific Coast is 1000 tons a
day. with increasing demand. The Orient also
affords a great market. It Is the purpose of
the New York syndicate to build a plant with
a present capacity of 10OO tons daily. They
look upon the Pacific Coast as the greatest un-
occupied Iron field in the world, where trusts
or combinations cut no figure and large profits
are permanently assured. They anticipate the
beginning of the" foundation for the furnace
plant within sixty days, and will push It to
early completion. They are receiving great en-
couragement from foundry and shipbuilding
people all over the Coast, who assure them
unbounded success." â¢
The above Is one of many eigna of time, all
of which go to show the enormous develop-
ment assured the Pacific Coast within tha
next few years. It is for the reader to deter-
mine whether or not he shall share largely In
this prosperity or whether he shall plod along
in the same old rut. It Is our candid opinion,
and that opinion Is shared by 600 people who
hold Its stock, that the Montezuma Minlnff
Company will make more money for Its share-
holders (the present low price of- the stock
considered) than any other company on tha
Coast. The mines are rich in copper naA cok-
ins coal, and have only to be developed to
become great dividend payers. The co-opera-
tive, principle adopted by the Company makes
It possible for anybody to share In the profits.

Topeka Jury Finds Mrs. Carrie Na-
The conductors and one motorman
joined the strikers, and the wounded man
went to the hospital. He said his name
was Marshall and that he lived at Green
Point, L. I. 'Five arrests were made, and
thus ended the first day's efforts to run
cars. '
There was a perfect fusillade of stones.
They came from all directions and
crashed through windows, front, rear and
sides of the car. The men aboard dodged
and jumped from side to side to escape
and were successful with the exception of
the motorman. A great ragged edged rock
struck him full in the forehead and he
dropped to. the floor of the platform. It
was a deep, ugly gash the rock left and
the blood flowed from, it in a stream. The
unfortunate man dropped into, a pool of
his own blood that covered the entire
platform. The assistant, as soon as the
man dropped, grasped the brake and con
trolling handle and faced the mob. A few
feet more and the car was upon an Insur
mountable barricade. With a sudden jerk
it came to a stop and all aboard It were
thrown forward, one of the conductors
falling among k pile of broken glass and
receiving some ugly wounds and cuts.
Before the car had started two police
men boarded It. ' They simply made two
more targets for the stones. The car had
not gone fifty feet before one's helmet
was crushed, and the other policeman waa
in danger of having more than his helmet
damaged.
All restraint in the great crowd broke.
Through the middle of the street men ran
with women and children, mingling with
the officers of the law, whose clubs were
swinging and arms moving in vain almost
to keep the people from danger. Men
stooped to pick up stones and were over
turned, to be pushed and kicked by the
others. â¢ .
It continued . to the Union Station and
returned, followed most of the way by
bicyclists and people in vehicles. Tne sec
ond car did not escape. When the doora
wera cpered the mob surged toward It de
spite the efforts of the police. The crew
consisted of four men . dressed in plain
clothes. As the car swung around the
curve there was a rush fbr It. but the
crowd was driven back. The committee
from the strikers was allowed to approach
the men. . . '
"Do you want to come with us, boys?
You won't regret it."
There was no response from any of the
men. The motorman, with his smile gone,
waved them aside, and the car was off
again. -
Car Wrecked, Motorman Wounded.
TIm riot to-day was full of exciting
features. At 10" o'clock two of the big
car doors swung open and out darted a
closed car with all the windows closed.
Immediately there was a roar of hisses
and stouts. Several men made an effort
to board the car, but were kept from do
ing so by policemen, one of whom was
stationed on each car step. The car made
rapid headway and almost before .the ex
pectant crowd realized what had hap
pened it was well on its way over Quail
street.
General Oliver issued an order assemb
ling at their armory the Tenth Battalion
of Albany, comprising four companies of
the National Guard Infantry, and the
Third Signal Corps, mounted. General
Oliver said that he would warn the re
mainder of the Third Brigade to be in
readiness for a call.
'The men claim that they were brought
here under a misapprehension, and they
supposed they were going to Philadelphia.
This afternoon the police practically ad
mitted that they were powerless to cope
with- the large crowds on the streets If
cars were run, and General Manager Mc-
Xamara Immediately called upon General
Oliver, in command of the Third Brigade,
fpr protection. He said:
"We intend to run our cars if It takes
the entire National Guard of New York
State to protect us."

ALBANY. N. T.. May 14.â When dark
ness fell this evening several thousand
weary street car strikers and sympathis
ers went to their homes, but they were
replaced by as many more who took up
the vigil to prevent the United Traction
men. from running their electric cars with
non-union men. The darkness brought
some confidence that there would be no
attempt before morning to move cars, tor
two, attempts made in broad daylight bad
brought bloodshed and riot on such a
scale that the total police, aided by scores
of deputies and i Pinker ton men, had been
unable to quell the disturbance. One man
lies in a hospital seriously wounded, on*
of the two cars the company attempted to
run is in the gutter of a street not two
blocks from 'the carhouse wrecked, and
the trolley wires are cut in several places,
practically crippling the road. Near the
car houses are thousands of men, women
and children wrought up to a pitch of
frenzy that bodes ill if the doors of the
car house open to let out another car.
Inside the car house, afraid even to look
out of the grated windows, are about
seventy-five non-union men, whom the
company expects to use in running the
cars. Early this morning there were
about 150 of- them, but by nightfall sixty
five had deserted and Joined the ranks of
the . strikers."

SONS OF HERMANN MEET
IN ANNUAL SESSION
When seen yesterday " Chief Organizer
Pierce would not make a reply to the pub
lished statement of Vice President Ches
ter of the Building Trades Council. Ches-, 1
ter accused Pierce of being in the^'strik-i
business" for what there was in it, but
Pierce maintains that he is only working
for the good of the cause.
Labor matters remain practically un
changed. A conference was held yester
day afternoon by'the leaders of the labor
movement, but no definite" results were
reached. Jeff D. Fierce, Chairman Goff,.
Secretary Rosenberg and other members
of the. executive committee , of the j San
Francisco Labor Council, met in confer
ence. Later in the day there was another
meetingat which the situation was again
discussed. The effecc of- the enforcement
of a general boycott with its attendant
consequences was considered. Radical
measures were considered, but no definite
or startling results were obtained. ,
From outside sources comes the infor
mation that not until next Monday will
any attempt be made to inaugurate a
general strike. So far the executive com
mittee of the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil has wisely determined to let matters
take their usual course. But the charge
made by Louis Chester of the Building
Trades Council that Organizer Pierce is
not in 1 the business for his health alone
has set some of the more rabid workers
thinking. The situation may change at
any moment, but there is no apparent
disposition on the part of the leaders for
a final test* of strength.
A conference was held last night at the
headquarters of the- labor alliance, but
no definite results were reached. A num
ber of unions met and passed resolutions
of sympathy with the cause of the strik
ing cooks and waiters. The influx of
strangers attendant on the Incoming of
the President, necessitating additional
help, slightly disarranged strike Condi
tions. .. Â¦ '.'Â¦ ' '. Â« Â¦.' . .
Adjoining the sulphur works is â¢ the
building of the American Chemical and
Cream of Tartar Company. For a time
this structure was threatened, but by dint
of hard work the firemen succeeded in
confining the flames to the sulphur works.
According to the directors of the com
pany the loss is fully covered by insur
ance.
Notwithstanding the dangrer of being
suffocated by the fumes of the burning
sulphur the firemen entered the building
and heroically gave battle to the flames.
After two hours' hard work they finally
succeeded in extinguishing the blaze, but
not until several of them had been over
come by the overpowering fumes, and
carried out.
By this tims the flames were shooting
through the south side of the building
and threatened to destroy the entire
structure. An alarm was promptly
sounded from box 352, but as the flames
were gaining considerable headway a
second alarm was rung in a few minutes
later.
The fire started in the packing-room of
the works, presumably from a spark from
the furnace. It was first discovered by
John Peravvi, v:ho was standing on the
opposite side of the street. Accompanied
by Charles Manson, who conducts a gro
cery store in the immediate vicinity, he
started to enter the basement of the
building, intending: to notify the watch
man, but was driven back by the over
powering fumes of the burning sulphur.
Realizing that a serious fire was immi
nent. Peravvi ran to the nearest, engine
house and notified the foreman of the
company of the blaze.
The San Francisco Sulphur Works at
Bay and Dupont streets came near being
destroyed by fire yesterday afternoon. As
it was more than $3000' worth of sulphur
Â¦went up in smoke. â¢

Acting Immigratioii Commissioner
General Lamed Makes Suggestion
Only Partly Approved.
F. H. Larned, ?Acting Commissioner
General of Â¦ Immigration, wrote recently to
United States Immigrant Commissioner
Hart H. North at this port asking his
opinion as to the advisability of havinng
an immigrant station established on one
of the islands in the bay. The note men-
tions that Special* Immigrant Inspector
Robert Watchom recommends such afa es-
tablishment in connection with the en-
forcement of the Chinese exclusion laws.'
Acting Commissioner Lamed suggests
that the quarters .might be made suffi-
ciently commodious to serve for Chinese
immigrants as well. " y
Commissioner North -in .â¢ his reply ap-
proves of *the proposition fs.o '.far -as "the
Chinese exclusion laws are concerned,' but
does not approve of.it in the case of other
classes of immigrants. He says that the
system of examining immigrants on board
ship while coming down the harbor is
more expeditious, and gives better satis-
faction to travelers and to the shipping
Interests than would be the case by ctlig-N
ing all the immigrants to go. to Angel
Island for inspection. Mf. North adds:
"If there should bs another influx of Jap-
anese immigrants like that of last year
T think an immigrant station would be
very^useful, but such immigration is very
slov/*at this time. "

Sudden Death, "of E. C. F. Lubeck.
The aged man who was found last Mon-
day night in an unconscious condition on
the sidewalk on the corner of Twenty-

and County -Hospital was identified at the
Morgue y'esterday as E..C. F. Lubeck, a
retired cabinet maker residing on Treat
avenue. He was i unmarried. The au-
topsy by Morgue Surgeon Dr. Bacigalupi
levealed valvular disease of the heart as
tho cause of death.
