ENTHUSIASTIC WOMEN NEW A PATHWAY TO THE
LOFTY RUINS OF THE MESA VERDE CLIFF DWELLERS
Mrs. McClurg, the first
woman to attempt so hazard
ous a journey.
Obliged to hide for days
from hostile Indians.
Finally r?aches the homes
of the ancient Cliff Dwsllers.
Society bps been formed to
preserve these wonders and
make them accessible to the
general public. 1
/T\ HE cliff dwellings, of Colorado are
; I to be made into a national' park.'
I* When dwellings of learned that
to be made into a national park.
When Mrs.*McClurg learned that
X rulrs of the ancient dwellers in
the Mesa Verde were inaccessible to
any. but the boldest and most tireless ex
plorers, and that no woman had ever seen
them, she ma<Je up her_mind right then
find there to look them over at her leis
ure and when It suited her fancy.
Few women would care to risk their
lives Just to ecramblÂ© up almost to tin:
heavens to minutely examine ruins that
are "so old that one hesitates to name the
years, but then those kind of thing*
come naturally to Mrs. McClurg. Before
her marriage she was a Miss Vlrgina
Donegho, a defendant of Edward A.
Doneghe, who made the first anthropo
logical collection for Harvard and Vale.
For centuries these ruins have been
considered by archaeologists to be among
the finest and most Interesting in the
world. All this time they have stood al
most unknown and wholly neglected in
the MancoH Canyon of Southwestern Col
orado. Only two scientific expeditions
'have ever penetrated the country, but a
few careless sightseers and tourists have
succeeded In getting where they couM
trample, pull and carry away pieces .if
pottery valuable only to science.
" Now these ruins have been opened an 1
made accessible to the public by Mrs,
Gilbert McClurtj at the bead of the Cola
THE SUNDAY CALI*
raflo Cliff Dwelling Association, which '3
composed of fifty women.
For sixteen years she labored, never
once losing sight of her object.. In 1855
she persuaded a party of friends to go
with her. While they were struggling
along, but merry withal, they heard a
familiar but dreaded whoop.. There was
no : time for cerem<jny and no time to
think about where-one was stepping. The
main idea was to get away, as far away
from the Indians as possible. It was far
preferable to fall and be* decently dashed
to pieces than it would be. to drop into
the hands of the hostile and merciless
wretches.
For days they had to hide, afraid to
draw a long: breath for fear of being dis
covered. Â¦ While trying to explore under
cover of darkness Mrs-. IVTcClurg fell and
nearly lost her life. While she suffered
hunger and thirst, weariness, danger and
ram, it never occurred to her to give up
Lei plans. Never once did she show the
while feather, nor "did. she allow her
friends to become discouraged if she could
help it. - " / :''
All that could ever be dragged from her
was: "I am ; awfully anxious to have
-Â»ther women see what 1 have seen, and
so- thoroughly enjoyed, but I do not
want and sincerely trust that no woman
will ever suffer- ac 1 have done." .
The Inaccessibility of the dwellings was
the first and greatest obstacle , that con
fronted them. Unfortunately, they are
between thirty and forty miles fr-m any
railroad,. over a rough, wild, uninhabited
country, and the cliffs can be reached
only after a long and tiresome ride and
at great expense of time and- money.
The fix st object to be attained was the
wagon road. And that was where the
chief difficulty arose.
The Mesa Verde is a part of the LTte
reservation, and the Indians objected se
riously to white people traveling .' over
their, land. 'Finally Mrs. McClurg, who
knÂ«?w the Indian chief, hit upon d' clever
plan. She appeared before the council
and through an Interpreter asked to lease
the land at their own price.
' The end of it was that the chiefs signed
a lease giving the association the right to
build. and use a wagon road, and- it was
In consideration of the yearly sum of Â£500.
The road was immediately commenced,
and when it was finished a party of twen
ty-two started to celebrate* its formal
opening. They left the train at Manccs,
where they were received by Mrs. C. I*
Kldre'.;;e, Hie secretary of the association,
and Alfred Weatherill, one of the pioneer
pathfinder* of the Mesa Verde.
Ail that day they traveled, and when
the sun' hid Itself behind the cliff the
end of the road had Just been reached.
Only the most enthusiastic cared any
thing about cMffs or dwellings just Him.
All they wanted was a chance to sin 1.
ineli cramped limbs and to refresh the
inner man. The ruins would wait until
1 ii. n. 1 1 row.
r J 1..Â¦I ..Â¦ path to any house is long and
steep, and one Is obliged to scramble
mightily to get there at all. The easiest
.mi the Him to reach is the Sandal
House, or "Moccasin House," as it Is
sometimes called. This ruin is small, but
well preserved and beautiful. It neatU'fl
under a shelving rock for all the world
like a toy castle. There are two square
rooms; the round room, or estufa. as it
was called, and passageways around and
behind.it. All the doors are low and the
.windows are narrow. It looks more castle
like on account of its turrets, which a?.e
broken now and fallen Inu decay.
, One ruin baffled the most -courageous.
It seemed located in the heavens, yet the
two tiers, one above the other, in the
jutting; structure of the cliff, the upper
and lower houses being separated by a
narrow shelf ledge of rock, were tempt
ingly visible. All they could do was to
pause thousands of feet below it and name
It after Mrs. Mary Hemenway.
; : Those ancients must have been thrifty
souls, for every available building site
boasts of a fortress home. If the space
was small, then the house was correspond
ingly so. The smallest seem haTdiy capa
ble of holding more than one person and
one entertains grave doubts for their com
fort. In the various canyons there are
between live and six hundred dwellings
of different sizes.
The Cliff Palace stands like a miniature
impregnable fortress against the intense
.,â¢Â¦-/
blue of the sky. Just to look at it made
the hearts of some of the explorers sink.
They suddenly recollected that it would
be wisest not to leave the horses alone
and they stayed in camp to welcome the
weary wanderers home, fc
â¢ While they . started out together they
soon fell into parties of twos and threes,
making their slow and tedious way wher
ever and however they could. It was a
terrible climb. In some places great piles
of rocks and fallen bowlders barred the
way, in others there were masses of tan
gled" brush and undergrowth which
scratched the hands and faces and tore
v the clothes.. Then again a precipitous
cliff made them crawl about it on their
hands and knees and the dizzy heights
would make them hang on cat-like by
means of knees, back, toes and fingers.
Anything rather than lose the balance
and be' dashed to pieces on the rocky
ledges below.' . The eleven who finally
reached the destination were dripping
with perspiration, parched with thirst %
shaking with exhaustion, torn,' scratched
and thoroughly weary.
Nothing mattered but rest and water.
The tired souls threw themselves down
to reft near the tiny spring that is at
the foot of the old Cliff Dwellers' stair
case.
Who cared whether the water was warm
and whether it was filled with wlgg'.ers
and plenty of dill? Not one there. U
was considered a matter of but lit lt; iiu
portai
A feeling almost of awe tilled the trav
elers as they gazed with reverence upon
the homes of a people mo'dorod to <1 e.i>
thousands of years its" The first impres
sion made upon all was one of intense
surprise. The ruin* are not the rude huts
of savages, hut, though primitive In
structure, have suggestions of architect
ural grace, The general sentiment In tha
first view of the Cliff Palace Is to marvel
nt its beauty. As it is. it is sheltered
from both storm and enemy, but it looks
lonely and Isolated; it is filled with tho
debris of its own ruins and the rooms axe
choked with dUS*.
The finest of all tlif dwellings in the
United States Is very large. It is fash
ioned very much like the popular apart
ment house of to-day. On the ground
floor there are 127 rooms, some- of them
very large, and some so small that they
look just Hire little ders.
There are two noticeable facts con
nected with the house. One of the khevi
.or c;-tuf:is shows the places for the sacred
tiro.-; and Â«sound -walls and ceilings. The
openings were from the top through
which admission was gained. None of the
three rooms bo situated has doors or
windows, and it is very evident that they
were used for religious and ceremonial
purposes. The other evidence was that
the same house was used for the dead as
for the living. Several of the walls were
tightly walled up. but when broken down
were found to contain well preserved
Eheletons.:
Pieces of hide, ears and cobs of corn,
pieces of feather cloth, urns and vases,
and reives made of yucca fiber, beside*
arrow heads, parts of bows, and some
remains of turkey bones, were- found, but
the vandal hands of sightseers have car
ried off every thins that it was possible
to remove. There is nothing now left ex
cepting that which is too heavy and too
unwieldy to carry away.
Spruce House, so called from the fact
that a monster spruce tree has grown up
through the walls, showing the ages that
must have come and gone since the tiny
seedling found its home in the ruins, is
the blessed, refuge of the visitor. Aside
from its romantic location, and the thick
growth of trees that affords the weary
traveler a little rest, there. ls a stream of
clear, cold water. To improve this spring
Mrs. John Hays Hammond has given
I'M) that it may be accessible to climbers.
There are about fifty or sixty rooms in
the house, but the walls are so badly
crumbled that it is Impossible to know
anything about them.
Balcony. House -Is in many respects the
best preserved of all. And again it shows
the most recent occupancy. ah the walla
are smooth and even the atones are well
fitted together. The . tower is still
straight, square, and has three windows.
The whole idea gathered is that a very
few men could hold out indefinitely
against a vastly superior enemy.
The names of* all these houses have
been derived from something connected
with them. For Instance, Balcony House
Is bo called from tho projection that was
undoubtedly used to Bit and rest upon.
Like all the ruins in Cliff Canyon' it la
difficult of access, and li filled with dry
dust and fallen walls.
The Colorado Cliff . Dwellers' Associa
tion has presented a bill asking that
"the cliff dwellings of Colorado shell not
be destroyed by time or vandalism, but
that they may be preserved for the bene
tit of scientific Investigation for years to
come."
1 this bill is passed, as It is confident
ly expected It will be, the ruins will
long remain a pride and a pleasure for
the people of the United States, and a
wonder and an attraction to foreign*WHAT TO DO.

1 Learn to walk.
c ' Learn to stand.
These two tricks comprise a big
. part of the secret of "how to be beauti
ful." You very probably think that you
know all about them now, that you al
ways have known, that everybody knows
Instinctively.
So we all do, likely enough, but we for
get. If you carried yourself when stand
ing and walking as you did when you
were a wee bit' of a youngster you would
be a better and a prettier woman to-day.
Perhaps you are one of the few women
â¢ who know how. This is not for you, then".
The rest of you, come forward. There
Is a tip or two that may be worth your
while.
The word "better" was not used care
lessly. It meant better. For correct
standing and walking induce good health
and good health induces goodness. You
know that yourselves. Don't you always
make allowance lor the bad temper and
unreasonableness of cripples and blind
people and invalids en the ground of their
ill-hegllh? You call it an excuse for bad
ness, for cussedness in general. Can't
you reason, then, to the converse?
Correct standing and walking are val
uable as a means of improving one's ap
pearance, besides being conducive to good
health. It Is surprising how few women
arid or walk well. Many go along with
a slovenly, slouching gait, their shoulders
bent forward, the waist line, on a curve
and their heads down, thus making .1
god-forsaken appearance. Nut only do
they mar an otherwise beautiful figure,
. but they utterly destroy their vitality.
This Is one of the greatest and most
â¢common faults to be found the world
over. Women frequently appear to lack
pride when they assume ungainly posi
tions, but this is often not true at all;
they may simply lack muscular vigor of
the chest and .shoulder muscles, which
through disuse are allowed to starve and
80 weaken, In the end they refuse to do
their duty, i V*
There are certain muscles of the back,
around and between the- shoulders, which
if not exercised by holding a proper posl.
tioii of the body and other dally exercise
weaken and naturally incline to let the
shoulders droop forward. This in a short
time gives what we call round shoulders,
or a bottle back.
Never resort to the aid of shoulder

CULTURE
This is all that its title implies â "An Easy I>?sson in Physical

you have to do is to keep a few simple rulrs in mind and then see
that you live up to them. Other papers will follow this one, every one

ters worse. Exercise the shoulders dally
by the use of dumbbells until, they be
come strong enough to keep from droop
ing. You will be surprised how easily
the shoulders will 'assume their proper
position.
Carrying the body properly tends to
produce a better mental condition. One
Is more cheerful and capable of doing bet
ter mental work.
Standing improperly is noticeable In its
Influence on the digestive organs. When
the shoulders are held correctly the stom
ach Is held higher and Is' more free; in
this way it more readily performs the
work of digestion.
The same with the lungs; the chest
being thrust out, the lungs are more^free,
and one is able to breathe much more
deeply. People as a rule do not seem to
realize how necessary air.is to the lungs,
and yet they know they could not live
twenty minutes without it. Then if air
is of .such vast importance, if it is so,
necessary to life, why not take la all the
fresh air we can jfet?
. The failure to breathe properly un
doubtedly causes many cases of consump
tion yearly.
If those who have a tendency to lung
trouble would take early morning walks
in the bracing fresh air, iirst sipping a
glass of very hot water before starting
OUt, and if they would pay a great deal
of attention to breathing, inhaling long
and deeply through the nostrils, and ex
haling .slowly through the mouth, and if
they would walk with a iniick, regular
Stride, holding the body erect with chest
prominent, it is more than probable that
in a few months they would forget that
they ever thought Of lung trouble.
There is no need to rob yourself of
needed sleep for this walk; 7 o'clock In
the morning la early enough for bracing
air. You can walk briskly, for about
twenty-rive or thirty minutes just' before
breakfast. If walking is very agreeable
to you take an hour's walk, but not as
long as that if it tires. Gradually in
crease the walk, it is too bad that most
women do not take more pleasure In this
exhilarating exereiite. How often they
exclaim: "Oh. how I hate to , walk! I
never walk when I can ride." This uc
counts for the slovenly gaits so often seen
and ridiculed. So long as these women
think' walking so disagreeable they will
never know thai there i.-> more real,
throbbing, pulsating joy in it than In any
other exercise. Cultivate your deter

pleasure. Here are a few suggestions for
walking and standing which any one can
follow without special instruction:
Women generally stand and walk with
the weight of the body thrown on the
heels. This position throws the body
backward and makes the abdomen pro
trude, which is decidedly to be avoided,
as it has a tendency to enlarge the abdo
men. The weight should rest on the ball 3
of the feet; this throws the body slightly
forward. This will seem hard to do at
Jirst, but practice will overcome the feel
ing of tipping forward. /
Do not hold the shoulders back; this
gives the appearance of rigidity. Any
thing that shows effort is incorrect. Sim
ply raise the chest and let the shouldeis
Jail naturally, thus giving the chest that
appearance of fullness and strength
which Is so desirable.
Hold the head proudly, which, of course,
means high; this gives more fresh air to
the lungs, helping them to cast off dirf
cuse.
Always be careful to carry the skirts
gracefully; nothing looks <iuite so untidy
as to drag the skirts through the dirt
of the Streets. It is not only untidy, but
it is tempting disease.

When Maud came from the East- she
had one packed away snugly in her trunk:
What a surprise she would spring on the
girls, but she wouldn't until there were
a lot of them on the clubhouse steps. OS
.It was a' soft" jersey, with raised ' ribs.','
The back fitted snugly and was made Â¦Â¦ to
exactly fit the 'epace. between the top of..
the belt and edge of the collar. rÃy way

The gaudy red vests suited them exactly.
"What could be better for them to wear on'
the quad? â¢ Nothing. They were perfec

So the two classes of girls are rivals.
The only difference is: that Stanford go*;Â«
in for the red and the golfers are not
particular.' Anything swell or smart look
ing pleases in. in Just as well.
A dapper 'one is of a closely woven Jer

suggest a stripe. There is a collar on this
one, but it.'is of*a broad red and whitd

ular golfing, double faced. On the left

but it answers thÂ« purpose juht the same.
.How the Jersey can be made into so
many different designs is a mystery to
most people. There are abuut a baker's
dozen, and every one of them is de
cidedly different. One wight think that
THE MANY COLORED NEW GOLF WESTNEW GOLD VESTS
the vests' would look very much alike, as
do many of. them are cut exactly the

of the same package. Hut that Is not
so. They are as different as can be,
For instance, another red one is awfully

The vests with sleeves are not worn by
the college girls. When it is cold enough,
to necessitate sleeves they get into a
Jacket and call II square. But the golf
girl is trying to wear something, that .will
keep her comfortable while playing, and Â¦
that will answer the same purpose when
she has tossed her clubs aside. "
Bui don't Imagine for a moment that
the only color* that are popular are red
and white. There are a host ot others
that make quite as much noise and that
look quite as neat. Â¦
Next to the red ones come black and
white. Borne think they are the swellest
ever, but the red comes in first at the i
finish. The black and white, of course,
come in plaids or stripes. The checks are
the prettiest. The jersey does not at
tempt to be fancy, in fact that is not
needed with the crossbars.-
Instead of stopping at the waist, they
are cut longer and extend over; the hips
several inches. As they are double
breasted, they can be drawn snugly to
gether, â¢ and the curve at the' waist is
brought, into prominence. By way of va
riety, the buttons follow up and down ill
a .straight row, but they are not black
nor even white. They are gold and not
small gold ones either. No, they makd
quite a brave front.
Besides black and white, there are
greens and reds, blues anU yellows, en
tire blues, blacks, greens and whites.
There is hardly a color that Is not rep
resented, and sometimes one wonders if
the dyes hadn't run away with them

CALIFORNIA'S BEST KNOWN CLUB
â¢â -VOBKRT BURDETTE says that
fj when he married the present Mrs.
Jr\ Robert Burdette he became a club
X woman. â¢
When a wife can make a club
"woman out of a man it shows what she
can accomplish. Mrs. Burdette has prob
ably been instrumental In making as many
club women as any one in the State of
California, and when she and Mr. Bur
dette joined hands they also joined forces
and have been "clubbing it" jointly ever
since.
The first thing accomplished after both
of' them set to work In this partnership
was her election to the State presidency.
California clubs decided, after much ar
gument, to federate; having federated
they decided to elect Mrs. Burdette to be
their president.
That happened in 1900. Up to that time
Â»he had been identified chiefly with the.
J'bell Club of I*o3 Angeles.
Her home has for a long time been In
Pasadena, one of the Orange Grove av
enue homes that are counted very nice to
live in. As Pasadena, is hardly lury.'
THE SUNDAY CALL.
"California's Best Known Club
Women!" Do you know who they areP
Cr, in knowing who they are, ha\Â«s
you ever studied their personalities
to know why they should be consid
ered the "best known"? This s'tetch
cf Mrs. Robert Burdette is the fii 3t in
an interesting series on just those
lines.
enough to be energetic in Â¦ the matter of
woman's clubs, Mrs. Burdette drifted Into
the work in the big sister town and tha
Ebell claimed her.
In the BbeU she used her influence to
ward the same ends that she. is working
for now as State president. . Among club
women she stands out noticeably as a
champion of the home life. They all do
this in their words, but Mrs. Burden
shows by her life that she means it. Her
home Is a great deal more to her than her
club. 7.^;
"Club life for women Is an evolution
and has not reached Its highest type," she
Bays. "Ten years ago the evolution was
represented by 'self-culture'; then culture
of self through culture of neighbor; then
culture through service. There was once
danger of woman's training her head at
the cost of her heart, but that danger
seems now to be past. No work is good
that does not emanate from the home, in
its results return to the hnmÂ». and it must
be always secondary to the home." ,
This is Ihe keynote of her teachings and
she not only leaches but follows her own
instructions Hire the good divine. Her
home is a typical homo of the south
roomy, spreading, with plenty of lawn,
plenty of piazzas; above all, plenty of
hospitality.
The BurdetteÃ are Californlans in the
proverbial sense of the word. They believe
that their house is for the purpose of en
tertaining friends. They eat less than half
their dinners alone and the entertainments
they give are known for their lavlshness.
"Bob" furnishes good wit for the least and
Ills wife's tact keeps the wheels of tho
entertainment running smoothly.
With all this life as a hostess she has
found time to start work and keep it go
ing among . her own sex. The public
school reform has been one that has in
terested her and she has worked diligent
ly to drive politics out of the system and
to arouse the, desire for higher standards
of instruction, Another of her lines of
work has been for preserving the forests
of this State.
She said once In an address: "The wom
en of New Jersey are saving the Palisades
of the Hudson from destruction by men,
to whose greedy souls Mount Sinai is only
a stone quarry; the women of Colorado
Sarah
Com-
stock
nro saving: tneir elilT' dwellings and pueb
lo ruins; here In California we must pre
serve our forests from men whose souls
are ganawws."
Nor is she a sentimentalist on the sub
ject, but a strictly practical, scientific
thinker. At that time she pointed out the
reason for saving the forests on account
of the water supply guarded by their
shades. She was one of the foremost in
promoting the work that has 'since been
carried out.
Another of her watchwords is. "^ref
ormation Is better than reformation."
"Let us keep out vice," she warns her
hearers again and again, "California has
not yet become infected with slums such
as the Eastern cities know. Let us keep
out slum's Instead of trying to drive them
out after they 'have been Implanted here."
In appearance Mrs. Burdette is the last
woman of whom you would expect radical
and vigorous views. She is small, gentle
in manner, having a soft voice that with
some difficulty reaches all its listeners and
a face that shows more sweet good tem
per than strenuousness. She is rather
round-faced. In fact, and extremely rosy.
There is something in her smile that is
almost childlike and absurdly in contrast
with the proverbial expression of the
"clubwoman." "',' â¢;Â¦ â¢ \^
She is not eccentric in dress. Srlte' is
blessed with a good plenty of money, with
which she buys expensive gowns when
she goes East or to Europe, and the wom
en of Southern California have come to
look for the latest styles from Mrs. Bur
. dette, as if she belonged to the social
whirl or to the stage. Think of looking
for Paris fashions from a club woman!
1 She has not a striking personal appear
ance, and although she is a good speaker
and an earnest one she has won out by
means of something else. It is her tact.
This tact is what makes her a food host

truth Is that her real power shows itself
when she leaves the chair, descends from

The people who think that club life un
fits a woman for romance will find them

they confront her pretty little, story. The
most romantic kind of a romance is told
of her and "Hob" Burdettoâ how they

very poor, and the latter adjective was
what enforced their separation. After
they had drifted they each married some

A GENERAL WORD ABOUT

of it, since most of the iulcb of etiquette

People have agreed upon, certain con
ventions which have through the agÂ«a
grown Into a codeâ a decalogue of good
behavior. , . ~*"V~
There are circumstances where even tn"
"golden rule"â which exhausts most of
the requirements of politenessâ falls us.
As an Instance of this: A very young girl
at her first dance was offered a seat by
her partner during one of the. panting
pauses of a waltz, whereupon she an
swered with instinctive unselfishness, but
with entire ignorance of etiquette, "Oh, I
am not tired; you sit down!"
The conventional conduct s known as
"good form," or the lack of it, brings un
erring revelation of a person's social ad
vantages and position, and proclaims him
a provincial or a cosmopolitan.
A man who attempts to combine the at
tractions of wine and of Iced water by
making the "sorbet" the accompaniment
to his entire dinner, or orders a large cup

The social code has been written ana

olmnises that what was orthodoxy In ono

The word "etiquette" mean) originally
a ticket or tan amxed to a bag or bundle
in note its contents. From th.s the word
parsed to certain cards, which, during the
reign of Louis xiv or France, were given
by the court functionary to cum guest,
upon which were written the chief rules
oi the conduct to be observed. The word
has bean preserved tor lack of a-better
to express the recognised standard of be
havior among persons entitled to be con

lish equivalent is "good form." The one
expression is as open In the reproach if

Our own social code is patterned largely
after the usages in favor among- me Â£ns>
lish upper classes, although the** are oc
casions upon which we are a law unto
ourselves. The 'â¢Mother-isle * seta us the
example, but, having reached^ our matur
ity, we, Ln common with other grown-up
children, assume the direction of cur con
duct when we please.
Daniel Webster said, after a- visit to
England' "The rule of politeness there is
to be quiet, act naturally, take no airs
and make no bustle. This perfect breed
ing has cost a treat deal of drill."
We have among ourselves a largo often
of quiet ladies and gentlemen,, with minds
broadened by travel and association with
cultured people, with Inherited traditions
Of good breeding and : well versed in the
social ethics of the older civilizations. To
them wo may defer, to them safely look

gj It is only the chimney-corner philos
opher who scorns and sneers at learning
lie rules of etiuuette.
In the changeful conditions of our so
ciety, where, unlrammeled by class re
iltrictlcm, all may make their way to emi
nence, there is need of guidance In mat
ters, social and fortunately Â¦ a universal*
recognition of their importance. Many,
all over the country, are asking for cli
rection and for definite laws of conduct
to be observed, according to the most re
cent decrees of fashion.
There is nothing derogatory: to us that
wo arc not all conversant with the latest
forms of conventionality. Our society is
in evolution, but' the; anxiety to learn, tho.
Often painful dread of making a mistake,
is reassuring. They are "growing pains."
Bonaparte took lessons of the great
actor, Talma, how to comport himself In
his new dignity and had his court drilled
in etiquette as he did his army in military
tactics.
When the great, Catherine of Russl i
gave receptions to her nobility she was
obliged to publish certain rules of con- .
duct that would be unnecessary now with
the most untaught peasant. Gentlemen â¢
were not to get drunk before the feavi
was ended: ladies were enjoined not !â¢
'wipe their mouths on the table cloth, ana
noblemen were forbidden to strike the r
wives in company. The curiosity is sti.
to be met with.- in books . on table tnus
and the edict no doubt. was needed. - '
Formerly there was an etiquette of war.
The Frenchmen at Fontenoy, face to he â¢â¢â¢â¢
with their â¢ English opponents, poliiv v
bade tHem "fire -first." But these woJ.'
mannered men oppressed their peasant*',
and' in private broke all. the comm;>iil-
JTK'iits of courtesy which we revere.
â¢ This discrepancy betwecn^form and fact
has brought discredit upon the â¢â¢ subject"
of polite observances in the minds of'
some, who say: "Give us truth bcfoie
all things." .They say that rules of eti
quette involve a degree of dissimulalioii
that often implicates us in positive hypoc
risy, in unequivocal falsehood that none
should justify. They ask "Why palliate
untruths because they seem a kind of so
cial obligation?" Â¦ ,â¢ââ¢'"
This is a question for social casuists to
decide. " No thinking person would under
value truth, but, like -all good things, it
may be carried to excess...: .
. A very, amiable woman once called upon
a friend with a. new-born baby. "Isn't
she a pretty baby?" asked the delighted
mother. An affirmative answer was given,'
but the next day the mother ' received a
note saving: "On reflection I have con
cluded that I was not truthful when I
said your ba"by was pretty. I do not think
her a pretty baby, but I don't doubt that
â¢she is a good one and 1 hope may prove
a great joy to you."
One cannot but feel that In this instance
Truth was wounded in the house of her
friends. The deeper truth of kindness and
sympathy that for the moment saw the Â¦
baby through its mother's loving eyes
was sacrificed to the surface truth that
appeared after cool and unsympathetic
reflection.
We are not Justified, however, in de
claring to a friend that we are bored at
an entertainment and are going home and
In the/iext breath telling our hostess that '
we are indebted to her for a very delight
ful evening.
Nor may we say to our friend, "Don't
Introduce me to that cad," and the next
minute while shaking his hand repeat the
formula, "Happy to meet you"â unless one
can say it in such level perfunctory tones
that conventionality owes nothing to cor
diality and yet is satisfied,.
Politeness consists in repressing ill
natured comments In the first place, not
in asserting the contrary afterward.
There are a few persons who are rebel*
lious about some rules of etiquette which
seem useless for those of high moral cal
iber; but as other laws are made for the
majority, bo are those of social conven
tion* especially for those who are prone
to transgress.
Under th* head of such forma come the
rules of chaperonaÃe and most Important
it is that all young men and women
should observe the formalities ordained,
in their Intercourse with each other, no
mattar how well-fitted they may be in par
ticular instances to take care of them
selves. One Is compelled sometimes to
make personal sacrifices for the food of
the many.
Of course very few. of the rules of good
form are absolute and unchangeable and
they must be more or less regulated by
ii<- standards of the people one lives with
and the requirements of the place m
which one resides. i ;

HOW HELEN HYDE
STUDIED ART IN JAPAN
FRESH from the realms of the Mi
kado,, from the land of poetry
and wistaria, of romance and
contentment, comes Helen Hyoo
with a goodly store of new Ideas
:"n her head, and an equally goodly store
of beautiful water colors and illuminate -.;
etchings in her trunk. In fact, the giant
Saratogas are filled to the brim with
treasures, to say nothing of the boxes
and bundles, round, cblcr;g and square,
all sizes and shapes. 1 found her in her
roomy studio, away out on Union street,
in the confusion and fascination of un
packing these various bundles of em
broidered draperies, dull red, eld golds
and blues: dragons, sohjis. thunder gods.
Miss Hy de journeyed to Japan two
years ago, expressly to make a study of
the children, but after a year there so
many possibilities presented themselves
that the time was lengthened in order to
make a study of the once famous Kano
school of painting, which has won d':s
dinction from its individuality, its bold
ness of execution and simplicity in finish.
In all Japan but one representative of
this long unbroken line of ancestry, dat
ing from the fifteenth century, remains.
Each generation has been marked by
painters whose names are famous
throughout the world, and whose works
are still preserved in the British Na
tional Museum. Old Ka: the one sur
vivor, already bent with age, lacks am
bition, and unless some one ccmes forth
from the student element with force and
character to work a reformation and a
revival of this method, the once famous
'Academy of Kano. which was to Japan
what the Beaux Arts and Julien Academy
are now to France, wiil become but a
memory. With the Ingress of foreign in
nuenct-. togther with that sometimes fatal
trait of imitation, a new school, a C 'm
posite of the French, German, Chinese,
and a dash of the ancient Japanese, has.
been adopted, and the result? is not very
satisfactory.
The art of Japan is losing its individu
ality. The Japanese are -rally ac
cused of Â«ne great fault In landscape, the
failure to get perspective, but frcm the
originals which Miss Hyde brought with
work from the brush of Hiroshigo,
one of the most prolific of the present
-'ay landscape painters: also that of
Hokcsai â the perspective is excellent, and
Mis? Hyde says while attending: th<- Â¦ x-.
position given in Tokio she found only ,
one fault particularly noticeable; good j
in composition, good in color, good in
technique, but atrociously bad in draw
ing, and this applies to nearly all of the
modern schools in Japan. This fact is due
probably to the general aversion to work- j
ing from models.
In Japan it is .only in very exceptional ,
cases where models are employed ; all is
trusted to the memory, which is certainly
marvelous. Sometimes the landscape
painters make sketch studies, but even
then seMom use th m, preferring instead
t*--t vision which. the brain had photo
giaphca. This accounts for the lack of
detail in all Japanese work, but aside from
a poor drawirg- there are many things in
the ancient Japanese school from which
our artists could learn muchâ for instance,
deftness, accuracy and rapid execution.
There is no scraping QUt with a palette
knife, no retracing of a step once made,
lor most of the painting is done on silk
and absorbent material, and each stroke,
each tone mu:t be clear to the mind's 'eye
before the brush is. touched; then with
firm, bold strokes the flowers, trees and
birds are. painted in with almost on.;
Sourish Of the brush. To illustrate how
accurate execution is taught by Kano
Miss Hyde selected a brush from a num
ber of unwie^dly looking tools appearing
more like whlskbrccms than anything
else. ior seme of them art- fu!ly three
inches In width and are made from a
stiff, wiry rice straw. Then laying a pa
per on the floor she knelt after the man
ner of ail Japanese. painters and bending
over made a quick dab, a flourish, then
with a lightning turn of the wrist 'twaa
dene and all In ore stroke without re
moving the brush from the paper, a grape
leaf perfect in shading, Blushed In detail;
all but the vt-ining, which was traced In
with a tiny hairbrush. "How did you d Â¦
it?" I gasped, remembering that some
artists take fully' five minutes to gk the
proper 'shading of a leaf. "Weil, it took
me just a year to find out." laughed Miss
Hyde. The secret ol blending is to let th.Â»
brush make its own blend. For Instance,
a figure like this you have two saucersâ
one with dark gray ink, another with
light. You dip ore tide of the brush in
the dark, the other in the light. The col
ors run together and blend in the bristles.
So prepared, make one long sweep, heavy
pressure on the shoulder for the shading,
then lightly. You see this makes the gar
ment. Then one upward stroke without
removing the brush. One stroke for the

honor, for she has the distinction of being
the. first foreign woman to learn the pro
cess of " printing .in * color from wood
blocks, a system which is nearly two Cen
turies old. The technique of wood engrav
ing for book illustrating and color print
ing is an important study. Boards planed
to a smooth surface are used; upon this
a thin transparent paper upon which a
design has been traced is pasted face
down on the block. Sometimes to make
this more clear the paper is oiled to make
every line visible; the outline is then cut
completely away with a knife and - the
engraved block is ready for use. In black
and white one block only is used, but in
color printing a separate block for each

Of the Japanese people Miss Hyde has
many interesting things to say, but the
most salient point is the one that is
Americanizing Japan â the tendency to
adopt our less beautiful, less picturesque,

iortable mode of, dress. The Empress
and all ladies of high degree now never
appear in public in native' costume, but

A port was issued several years alto
by the inspector of prisons or the

incredible accounts are given of the prac

Bombay. The thieves themselves, *""

considers a last resort, for M pricles him

every native thief. Thy* is no easy mat

' house, surrounded by other apartments
occupied by ever wakeful sentinels. In
order to reach it the thief burrows under
the house until his tunnel reaches a point
beneath the floor of .the room to which
access is sought. But the cautious native

knows that the inmates of the house
sometimes detect the miner at work and
stand. over the hole, armed with deadly
weapons, silently awaiting his appear

Â¦ He has with him a piece of bamboo, at
one end of which a bunch of grass repre
sents a human head, and this he thrusts
up through the completed breach. If the
vicarious head does not come to grief the
i real one takes its place, and the thief en

finding everything already favorable for

seems an impossible under taking. This,
indeed, is no less a task than to remove
irom the ears and arms ami noses the
earrings, bracelets, armlets, bangles and
nose rings of the sleepers without awak

his plunder. Who but a dacoit would be
Â§qual to so delicate, dangerous and diffi
cult a piece of work? But the dacoit sel

full speed for the jungle. If they reach it
all hope of capturing them is at an end,
but even when they discover that they
must be overtaken before they reach it
they by no means lose heart, and are
measurably sure of escaping, especially
if. as is often the case in India, the sur

STILL ALL THESE STAGE FAVORITES MET THEIR FIRST
SUCCESSES HERE.
WHEN' a stage-struck girl tells
an Eastern manager that she
is from California, it counts
one for that girl.
This is always a dangerous
thing 1 to announce. it is hard on the
managers to let it out. For doubtless
there are California girls who are not
born actresses, and it's a mean trick to
turn Â¦hem loose on weary theatrical men.
Hut it's the truth, Cor all that: a Cali
fornia birthplace or experience is looked
â¢upon as a mascot by all who know Cali
fornia's reputation.
If San Francisco could corral her dra
matic celebrities as they come back and
keep "hem here, she would never be ac
credited a "jay town" by theatrical folk.

geniuses since the days "when the old

Lotta. was one of our earliest stars. She
pave to the city the fountain at the
corner of Kearny and Market as a mem
orial of gratitude to .the first city that
recognized her ability as an actress.
Blanche Bates, "Our Blanche," went
to the public schools of this city, gradu-
Â«t*4 from them, and taught in them be
fore she finally bowed before the foot
lights. Frawley recommended her to
Oriffen & Neill in Denver. Frawley was
their leading man and stage manager. He
recommended Blanche for "utility wom
an," which is a stage expression, and
means one who takes small parts hi a
play, the little odds and ends of roles.
Blanche was glad of the chance to show
her mt-ttle.
"During these years of her apprentice
ship she worked hard," says Mr. Ncill,
"doinjr everything with that thoroughness
that has characterized her work always.
"Sometimes when she was assigned a
email part she would come to me crying
and begging for heavier work."
Once Blanche sold tickets in the box
office to help out.
It was at the Lyceum Theater in Den
ver. Griffen had charge of the box
office while Neill was back on the stage.
One Eifternoon riff en was called away

vices, and she sold tickets well, too.
Griffr-'i Nell subsequently sold out
to Frawley, who was their leading man

ally had a chance to appear in New York,
where she aroused the jealousy of the
leading woman. Seeing a war of words
ahead, she quit the company after only
two appearance.
How she drilled into David Belasco's
training is an interesting story.
By the way. David Belasco is also a
San Franciscan; he is a man whose
name now counts for much in the Ameri
can drama. "
In the 'days when he was a hard-work
ing stage manager at the Baldwin he
was not widely known. Mrs. Bates was
the leading woman of his company. It
came into her power to do him a good
turn. He treasured gratitude in his mem
ory. Time passed. He wrote several suc
cessful plays and at last found' himself
in that Mecca of theater-folk. New York.
Here at last lie met Mrs. Bates and
her daughter, and proposed that Mn.
Bates should give him the opportunity U
train her daughter and bring out the tal
ent be believed she possessed. His fame
as a maker of stars had spread far and
wide, and so the training of Blanche as a
star began. Belasco is not an easy task
master, but in his new pupil he met abil
ity coupled with infinite patience.
In the part of Madame Butterfly it was
she who often begged him to let her go
through the part just once more after
She and he had drilled for hours together.
She spent more hours a day as Madame
Butterfly than she did as herself. She
grew to love the part, and when she took
off for the last time the little Japanese
costume she had worn in it, she kissed
it as she hung it up and declared that no
one would ever wear it but herself.
Her versatility is shown in her success
as Cigarette in "Under Two Flags"â a
greater contrast to Cho-Cho-San of But
terfly fame, and again to Hedda Gabler
cannot be conceived.
Maude Adams made her first tiny ap
pearance at the old Bush-street Theater
in a child's Dart. It happened in this
way. The manager suddenly fou%d that
he wanted a child and asked Mark Triad
if he knew of any one who would an
swer. He thought he did. He went down
back of the Mint where Maude' Adams*
family lived and brought the little girl
back with him. She made her first ap
pearance with J. K. Emmet. She was
lucky from the start. Her mother was
an actress and she breathed easily the
atmosphere of the stage. l:".-.^
She next went to the Alcazar and
opened in "The Midnight Bell." Sines
then her progress upward has been
steady.** When an antrcÃÂ» holds her Hi
ence in Bernhardt's roles she has gone
far, and this is what the little child
actress of the Bush-street Theater has
been doing for a season in New York.
Another child actress dear to the hearts
of the old-time theater goer was little
Minnie Maddern, now the inimitable Mrs.
Fiske of "Becky Sharp" fame.
She was between seven and eight years
old when she was known as the "wonder
child." For all that she was fond of dolls
and of playing house just as hundreds of
Other little girls are. One night during
her first engagement Minnie was playing
with a rag doll in the wings just before
her cue was spoken and she was so ab
sorbed in her childish pleasure that she
positively refused to go on unless she
could take dolly with her.' Consternation
reigned as the time for her appearance
diew arer. The matter was iinally com
promised by an agreement on the part of
the stage manager to give her the finest
doll that could be purchased in San Fran
cisco. For eighteen years Mrs. Fiske kept
this doll and finally sold it in a charity
bazaar in New York for $125.
Long before she wore long dresses oft
the stage she wore them in young lady
parts and occasionally took an old wo
man's part. At the age of 13 she scored
a hit in the role of Widow Melnotte in
"The Lady of Lyons."
At lii she was a lull fledged star.
Long as Mrs. ( Fiske has been on the
stage, she has never been able to over
come stage fright. She rehearses her
plays long and frequently. When she has
her lines letter perfect she still trembles
when the hour for her appearance ar
rives.
Mr. Neill, who was with her for a year,
tells a story about her chronic stage
fright: /
"We rehearsed a one-act play of hers
for three months. It came to be a joke
among us, the pains we took with that
I'itlc play. We almost knew it backward.
When at last the night arrived Mrs.
Fiske said to us. "Really, 1 don't think we
are ready to give that piece.' She was
frightened to death. *
"We laughed at her, we teased her, we
jollied her, but it was only with the
greatest difficulty that we persuaded her
to so on." - *' . Â¦ -
Sybil Sanderson was born in Sacramen
to, where her father was for many years
Chief Justice. She went abroad to study,
and made her debut in the Opera Co
mique, Paris, in 1889. She was renowned
for her "Eiffel Tower note," in a compo
sition which Jules Massenet composed es
pecially to suit her remarkably high reg
ister. Jules Massenet continues to. write
all his music adapted to her voice.
During the past season she appeared at
the Winter, Garden of Berlin, and from
THE SUNDAY CALL.
there went to St. Petersburg and Mos-'
cow. Everywhere her beauty of votes and
feature has won her new laurels, for
Sybil's; day is not yet past.
Alice Neilsen started as a chorus girl
at the Tivoli. Later she took small parts
and finally leading roles. She was a great
worker and had a wonderful memory.
Once she was given the title role in "Lu
cia di Lammernoor." In four days the
knew it perfectly.
When the Bostonians were here Barna
bee went to the Tivoli. heard her and de
termined to secure her. She became their
soprano.
Emma Nevada is a third daughter of
the West who is favored with a voice, a
real voice. She was born in Nevada and
in honor of her birthplace adopted Ne
vada as _her stage name. She was edu
cated at Mills Seminary, Oakland. Mrs.
John W. Mackay sent her to Paris, where
she studied with the famous Madame
Marchesi. . She made her debut at Her
Majesty's Theater, London.
In 18S5 she made a grand tour of the
United States and in San Francisco she
received an enthusiastic ovation.
She is now the wife of Dr. Raymond
Palmer and she has a beautiful home in
Paris.
"La Belle Francisca" sang three years
ago at the opera-house at Monte Carlo
with Patti. She was better received than
Patti, and the critics referred to her as
"the new star that was coming in " and
to Patti as "the old star that was going
out." This is praise extraordinary, for
Patti has hitherto held the undisputed
throne of song.
"La Belle Francisca" is known as
Fanny Miehelsen in everyday life. Her
stage name was taken in honor of her
native city.
H-len Modjeska, queen of the Polish
sta^e, bade farewell to her native land
and thought to spend her days on her
Idyllic California farm. But Edwin Booth
persuaded her to study for the English
speaking stage. She made her debut in
the California Theater.
Mary Anderson, a native Sacramentan.
won the fame of two continents. She
worked too hard. H..T health failed and
she withdrew permanently from the
stage. She is now Mrs. Antonio de Na
varro and lives in England.
Nance O'Neil is an Oakland girl. She
useJ to haunt the old Bush Street Thea
ter for a chance to go on. Finally she
got on as supernumerary. Now she often
taunts the managers who turned her
away in old days with: "Didn't I tell
you? I knew I had it in me even then.
All I needed was a chance."
Miss Eleanor Calhoun enjoys the dis
tinction of having been praised by Coque
lin and Sardou. She is said to be great in
Shakespearean roles.
Eleanor Robson, one of the youngest
actresses on the stage to-day, and one of
whom much is expected in the future,
first faced the footlights at the California
Theater. She came here straight from
the convent in Montreal in 1897 and joined
the Frawley company.
Phoebe Davies made her first appear
ance privately before David Balasco
when lie was manager of the Baldwin.
He booked her to appear at the next
Baldwin production, but illness pre
vented and it was wfth the California
Stock Company that she afterward made
her debut.
A San Francisco manager offered to
take her East and star her, but she re
fused, for just about that time Cupid was
aiming his arrows at her heart. Instead
of going East sIM married Joseph R.
Grimmer, who was then leading man and
stage manager at the Baldwin.
Joseph R. Grismer is best known for his
production of "Way Down East." It was
reserved for this production for Phoebe
to hit the flint which struck the nre of
general recognition for her.
Amelia Bingham. although not strictly
a Callfornian. had her rtrst stage experi
ence here with Mi-Kee Rankin, with
whom she made a tour of the Pacific
Coast.
â¢ The history of this actress is interest
ing. She is one of the foremost woman
managers of America to-day, but she had
to tight for every inch of the way.
Artistic heritage or encouragement was
not to her lot. She came of a family of
Methodists, who never went to the thea
ter.
When she declared her intention of go
ing on the stage her neighbors turned
against her and her best girl friends
passed her on the street.
Her Sunday school teacher, on bidding
her good-by. said: "Amelia. I hear there
are some good men and women on tive
stage. I hope so for your sake."
She resolved to be a leading woman In
a Broadway theater within five years or
quit the business. She kept her resolu
tion in mind. When she went abroad shÂ»
found that women as managers were suc
cessful. In Paris she found Sarah Bern
liardt the most conspicuous figure In tha
ranks of woir.in managers.

a cum! any. She is a great believer in the
fact ihitt "the play's the thing."
This actress-manager, who combines
artistic sense with business acumen, says
that k is a much greater compliment to
hear the people say on leaving the thea
ter. "Fine company, that Amelia Bingham
company," than to hear them 3pÂ«ak of
Amelia Bingham alone. *,
For this same reason she has great dif
ficulty in getting; a play to suit. Clyde
Fitch wrote a play for her. She refused
it because it was a star piece, and what
she desired was a stock piece which would
give the different members of her com
pany a chance and produce an artistic

Dermott of Oakland. At first she was
merely considered an artistic piece of
bric-a-brac. Her acting was ignored. Her
beauty was praisÂ».-d and pro vet! to be a
stumbling block on her road to success.
Self-consciousness seemed to overshadow
her emotional talent. Finally she learned
through the doctrine of work to grow
artistically. She now essays Shakes
pearean roles. ISABEL, FRA3BR.

"CARDIGAN"
AND
"THE RIGHT OF WAY."
TWO BOOKS THAT ARE WEUU> WORTH READING.
HARPER & BROS.. New York, have
certainly picked two winners in
the literary field. "Cardigan." by
Robert W Chambers, and "The
Right of Way." by Gilbert Parker, both
lead far and away ahead of all competi
tors in their respective classes of fiction.
"Cardigan." besides being the best work
from the pen of Mr. Chambers to date,
undoubtedly excels all other novels deal
ing with that period of American history
immediately preceding the Revolution -of
'75. In narrative and character drawing
of the kind that makes Cooper's "Leather
stocking Tales" the joy of every American
generation. Mr. Chambers shows particu
lar excellence. v
Although "Cardigan" is a historical
novel in the true significance of the word.
vet facts and descriptions are introduced
so skillfully and made so consistently a
part of the story that it is a most pleas
ant relief to the bungling efforts of that
great majority of cheap authors who have
of late been digging up on their school
books that they might make their fiction
"go" through the reflected light of long
dead greatness.
"Cardigan" is historical naturally.
Characters are not introduced merely as
lay figures and because the author expects
through familiar dealing with well known
names to create interest, but because they
are part and parcel of a well told tale.
It is interesting through the exciting
narrative to pause and appreciate the
gradual development of the hero. Cardi
gan, who gives his name to the book. It
is the same development that changed. the
cry of many a good man frcrr. "GÂ«5 sÂ»ve
the King" to "God save our^cocntry" and
brought success to a right' cause.
"Cardigan" ran Â«erlal!y in Hen3Â£i^-S
Weekly, so it is probably already^fczSiiSiar
to many of our readers. <^Â«rdÂ£gan him

' it is p!aln!y rcifain that he will prove of
the rrsrit siufl Jot the days of trial to fol-
Th*t part of the book that deals with
the Indian times, when 'the British
through treachery vcre endeavoring to
enlist the support of the Six Nations
igainsst the colonists, is remarkably -well
done. There is not only plenty of incident
end hair-breadth escape to hold the in
terest, but on Indian matters Mr. Cham
bers proves himself a close student. He
do3E not write of the Indian simply as the
big chief with scalps at his belt, a hatchet
in his hand and talking nothing but bad
pidgin English. On the contrary. he
looks ipon him with sympathetic eyes and
presents him rather in that dignified light
:-Â« characteristic of Cooper.
Of fighting there is a plenty in the book.
The - wrongs of the great chief LogAn
th re ugh the murdering of his family; the
subsequent outbreak of the Indians and
the light in the fort; and later, the skir
mishes of the colonists with the British,
notably In the Concord fight of 1775 â
are splendidly described. Cardigan's lons
run through the woods with Sir William
Johnson's messages to the Cayugas and
to Cresap. while the villain Butler and his
trackers are ch.se en his trail, forms as
exciting an episode in fiction as one could
desire.
In the way of character studies' the
sturdy backwoodsmen Jack Mount an.l
the Weasel show Mr. Chambers at his
best, although all of his plot-makers bear
the stamp of reality. For one thing I
rather admire Mr. Chambers and that is
his gentlemanly treatment of his arch v:!
lain. He does not allow Cardigan. whÂ°n
the crucial moment arrives, to soil his
hands with the life of Butler, but thrusts
the rogue out into the night and out of
the story after giving him a very close
tall lor his neck. There are not many
cuthors who would have used such for
bearance after their hero had been so
badly misused by such an arch fiend cs
the rascal Butler.
Some words must be said for "Silver
Heels." Cardigan's pet name for his lil
tle hum. who afterward becomes his
theart. She deserves a first place
among all the other delightful heroines
of romantic fiction who have become
famous in story and drama. Mr. Cham
bers works out his love story very pret
tily and delicately. In affairs of the heart,
Cardigan is delightfully dull and clumsy,
but the author pulls? him through all
right in the endâ not, however, with
out a struggle.
If you like a really good historical novel
K*-t ''ardiÂ£an." In story it may be a
little long drawn out for some, yet every
line of it is worth reading.
Of an entirely different sort is "The
Right of Way" by Gilbert Parker. In the
matter of close psychological study, pow
erful narrative and remarkable character
drawing this book easily leads any of
this season. It possesses all the power cf
Hall Caine's "Eternal City" without the
great bulk of 350,000 words that Mr.
Came finds necessary to express his
thouglats. The narrative runs along with
as much snap, zest- and "incident as any
of Hope's. Doyle's or Hornung's books.
In brief, Parker book is the story of
the moral and physical degeneration of
a man until a sharp climax is reached
and then the soul growth and develop
ment begin. Charley Ste>]e. as we know
him first, is a man of most remarkable
intellectuality; a â¢ man who possesses a
mentality as sharp and clear and cold as
the rays of a diamond. In the first pages
â¢we are introduced to him as he is win
ning a man's life from the gallows, a man
that Steele knows is guilty of murder.
This case proves one of the turning
points in the life of "Beauty" Steele for
it indirectly brings to him a wife. He
wins this woman simply on account of his
brilliancy. At this period there is little
In Stee'.e to excite love or affection. Ho
Is on the road to ruin through drink, and
worse than that, he is Bragging down
with him a young clergyman and his
wife's brother.
Things go from bad to worse -with
Eteele as the rears roll by. The clergyman
becomes a thieving speculator and the
brother-in-law turns embezzler to the
tune of some twenty-five thousand dol
lars. â¢ The appeal of his wife's brother
to Steele for help in this extremity starts
the lawyer out on a debauch that finally
winds him up in a tavern fight with the
river men. a knock on the head and a
plunge in tbe river.
Steele'e life is saved by the murderer
Â¦who owes so much to the young lawyer
for his able defense of many years before.
The scene then shifts to the miserable
hut of Steve's one remaining friendâ
this man whom Steele had, immediately
after the trial, called to his face "guilty
as hem"
Steelt recovers consciousness and then
bodily* health, but his mind for past
events is entirely gone and remains a
blank as to his former, life for months
and months, finally his lost memory is
restored by a sk<lled surgeon who becomes
Interested in the case without knowing
the identity of his patient.
Btecle comes to himself to find that his
wife has married a former sweetheart,
nd that the brother-in-law has fired the
rlme of embezzlement on the memory of
the sup.posÂ«d!y dead Steele. He cannot
go back to his home now without ruining
ihe lives of many, so he decides to make
the sacrifice and live out hir. life among
the humble folk of the village where
he is.
Steele finds employment as a tailor.
The change in the man and the gradual
broadening of his soul is most skill
fully and gradually perfected. Many
things occur to bring up the oid life to
him. and frequently he has to disappear
to avoid recognition. He finally falls
deeply in lov<; with a splendid girl who
returns his affection.
The great -human interest of the story,
after the reader feels certain that Steele
will not fall from grace and take to drink
Egain. lies in the possible consummation
of this love affair. There seems no chance
of a happy ending on account of Steele's
wife already living. Mr. Parker is too
clever a novelist to ruin so strong a story
by killing off ihe first wife and allowing

Mr. Parker may be criticized for the
rather Improbable tragedy of the safe
robbery that forms the ultimate dramatic
climax of his stcry. but the book is really
no splendidly written and so full 'â¢ of
strength and life that such a minor crit
icism reflects more discredit on the critic
than the author.
Judging from the great , demand for,

Recollections of a Georgia Loyalist.
Under the title, "Recollections of a
Georgia Loyalist," there have been edited
by the Rev. A. W. Eaton the memoirs
and some of the letters of Elizabeth Llch
tenstein Johnston, who was born in May,'
1764, near Savannah, Georgia, and who in
her childhood saw something of the bat
ties that took place upon the siege of that
city during the war of the Revolution.
In describing the situation she says: "In
'76 the people in Georgia were inflamed
against the government of Great Britain
and were raising a ragged corps of all
sorts. Some had guns with firelocks and
some without; and all, gentle and sim
ple, were made to declare .whether they
were on the side of the King or for the
people, whom we Loyalists then termed
Tories, called rebel?. If a Tory refused
to join the people he was imprisoned and
tarred and feathered. This was a terri
ble indignity, the poor creature being
stripped naked, tarred all over and then
rolled in feathers. I might once, if I had
gone to the window, have seen a poor
man carried all over town with the mob
around him In such a plight, but the idea
was too dreadful. He was an inoffensive
British pilot."
From that and a few similar anecdotes'
told in the introductory chapter it is
evident the writer, might have given a
very interesting account of the Tory side
of the Revolutionary War. Unfortunately,
Mrs. Johnson was writing: for her grand
children and not for history, and, more
over, she seems to have taken little In
terest in anything except her children
and her religion. The book as a whole
contains hardly anything beyond a rec
ord of the birth of her children, their va
rious dispositions, their sickness. ' their
travels and their marriages, interspersed
with ploue moralizing for the benefit of
the grandchildren for whom the memoir
waa written. After many wanderings,
Mr-;. Johnston and her husband settled
in Nova Scotia, and there her descend
ants have flourished, many of them bfe
com!i;g eminent men. The book, there
fore, is more valuable as a contribution
to the early history of certain Canadian
families than as a memoir of a Georgia
Loyalist. (Published by the Bankslde
Press; M. F. Mansfield & Co., New York.)
Fables for the Fair.
Among all the output of present day
fables those of only two writers seem to
be bound otherwhere than toward the
Â¦waste basket. One of these writers is
Josephine Dodge Daskam.
Her "Fables for the Fair,"' which have
l><Â»en appearing from ftlme "to time, scat
tered among various magazines, have
been picked up at last and put together
between neat and attractive boards.
Twenty-five of them appear in the vol
ume. They are almost equally Witty In
form and penetrating in insight. Miss
Daskam has a keen way of looking at
human nature and a remarkable sense of
humor for any one, to say nothing of her
being a woman.
One of the .very best of these good
things is:
THE WOMAN WHO HELPED HER
HUSBAND.
There was once a Woman whose Hus
band Depended on the State of the Mar
ket for his Daily Toast. One Day he.Ap
peared before Her with a Sad Counte
nance. : . â¢
"All Is Over, my Dear." said he.
"Wheat, is 'Way Down and # l Doubt if
after To-morrow we shall 'have More
than Ten Thousand a Year to Live On. I
am Sorry that I Married you to Drag you
Down to This, but I must Tell you Sooner
or Later. lam a Ruined Man." :
"Nay, do not Lose Heart." said his
Wife. "Can you not Speculate Further?"
"I Cannot," he replied, "for I have Lost
my Nerve. My Friends Urge me to Throw
what I Have into Copper, but I dare Not.
Five Thousand a Year would Hardly buy
Croquettes for Two. I would Better Keep
what 1 have Saved from the Smash."
"At any rate." said she, "Come out and
Have some Lunch. Let us go to Sherry's
and get a Nice Little Bird; then you will
Feel Better." t 
"Bird!" exclaimed her Husband. "Un
happy Woman,, if you see Anything Bet
ter than Broiled Chicken and Beef a la
Mode for the Rest of Your Life you will
Do Well. In My Present Frame of Mind
I would Suggest a Night Lunch cart."
"Let us have one Good Meal at least,"
urged his wife, "Before we Die to the
World. I have Twenty Dollars in my
Purse. I will Buy our Lunch with that.
After that the Night Lunch."
"Very well, for the Last Time," replied
Her Husband.
They then went to an Expensive Res
taurant and Ate a more than Satisfactory
Luncheon. At the end of it her Husbanii
said:
"I think Better of that Copper than I
Did."
Then he went Back to Wall Street and
Made Sixty Thousand Dollars in Thirty
eight Minutes.
This teaches us that Digestion is the
Better Part of Â» Valor.

Gloria Deo.
Every pastor who desires . to develop or
improve the congregational singing in his
church will be glad to know that a new
church hymnal, "Gloria Deo," just pub
lished by the Funk & Wagnalls Company
New York, meets this requirement it
contains striking advantages without sac
rificing any of the substantial merits of
the older works.
First-Every hymn in the entire work is
given under the music. Not a single hymn
Is printed separate from the music. The
lines of all the verses are directly under
the notes of music In which they are to
be sung. The Words of each line are care
fully subdivided bo as to bring each sylla
ble below and close to the note to be sung.
Second- Gloria Deo" provides a selec
tion of the hymns and tunes which a
twenty-year experience In church work
has proven to be the best for both congre
gations and choirs. ' . . .
Third-In this one volume are contained
hymns suitable for the church, the Sun
day school, the Young People's Society '
and other organizations, a feature which
not only enables all to use the same book,
but makes all, from the youngest to the
oldest, familiar with the best hymns of
the church and enables the young people

from trying: to arrange a variety of books
in the seats or pew racks. (Price 51 25.)
A Boy's Bock.
"When "We Destroyed the Gaspee," by
James Otis, is a story for boys, relating
how his Majesty's aTmed schooner Gaspee,
sent to Narragansett Bay in 1772- to en
force the unpopular revenue acts, was
punished for many deeds of insolence and
aggression on the part of her command-
Ing officer and crew. The ship was cap
tured and destroyed while stranded upon
a dangerous shoal, whither she had been
decayed by a Yankee packet. The strategy
and boldness of the attack are set forth
with genuine gusto by the youth of 1G â a
participant in the tight â who tells the
story, and the reader Is led to feel very
keenly the proud love of liberty in the
hearts of the Colonists. There is plenty
of pluck, danger and good fighting in this
book. Illustrated with sixteen full-page
and text drawings by L. J. Bridgman.

The Miracles of Missions.
"The Miracles of Missions, " by Arthur
T. Pierson. D.D.. is a series-- of very brief
narratives of facts, written with as far
as possible absolute accuracy, which both
demonstrate and illustrate the perpetual
presence of the supernatural factor in all
true mission work. The word "miracles"
is designedly used in order to bring out
the unmistakable divine working and the
great variety of facts presented, the trl
vmphs of the gospel In all lands and
among all classes of people, has the effect
of strands braided into a rcVpe; any one
narrative might be insufficient to be tho
basis of a safe Induction, but when all
this testimony is combined a candid mind
cannot resist the evidence that Christ's
words are continually fulfilling, "Greater
works than those shall ye do, because I
go '-nto the Father."
The present volume, which has just
been issued from the press of Funk &
Wagnallfi Company, New" York, Is the
fourth of Dr. Pierson's Valuable series f
"Miracles of Missions." The preceding
volumes are uniform in size and binding
and sell for $1 per volume in cloth binding
and 35 cents in paper. This fourth volume
is issued under the rule;- of the American
Publishers' Association ;;s a "net" book.
The price, therefore", is lower than that
of the preceding volumes, being 90 cents
net in cloth binding and 30 cents net in
paper binding.
The Owl and the Woodchuck.
W. H. Neldlinger ancl Walter Bobhett
have found the ideal method of children's
bookmakingâ a combination of picture,
song and story. In this new book, pub
lished by Rand. McNally & Co. of Chi
cago, is told the story of "The Owl and
the Woodchuck" in the most effective
way possible for the understanding of the
little ones. The preface introduces both
of the principals through the medium ot
a little song, with piano accompaniment;
then follows the story itself, with color
illustrations and also marginal pen and
ink sketches. The scheme of the authors
has been to use music where nothing else
will serve so well to express the idea
such as for the calls of the birds, etc.,
and when explanation is necessary prose
is employed or verse, as may seem most
appropriate; if a pictaire suggests itself
It is sure to be there and jotted in among
the type just where it will be of the most
use to give the proper Idea. This book
cannot be too highly commended and de
serves to become a good seller for the
holiday trade. It is the best ciiild's book
that has as yet been brought to our no
tice.
Beynard the Fox.
Dana Estes & Co.. Boston, have just
published a version of the famous beast
fable, translated into English verse from
the Low German of the fifteenth century
and adapted for modern readers.
This book belongs to the rare class
which is equally delightful to children and
to their elders. In this regard It may be
compared to "Gulliver's Travels," "Don
Quixote" and "Pilgrim's Progress." For
wit and shrewd satire and for pure droll
ery, both in situations and description, it
is unsurpassed. The aniniais are not men
dressed up in the skin of beasts, but are
throughout true to their characters, and
1 are not only strongly realized, but con
sistently drawn, although in so simple
and captivating a way that the Subtle art
of the narrator is quite hidden, and one
is aware only of reading an absorbingly
interesting and witty tale. . . -:.-;-Â£.
When to the charm of the poem Is added)
the exceptional skill of the â¢ Illustrator.,
whose genius in caricature and in animal
drawing was demonstrated in his popular
edition of . "Aesop," published last year,
one can hardly look further in seeking, for
an ideal gift book for nursery table or the
library. (Price 50.)
Arline Valere.
"Arline Valere" by Joseph Hallworth. is
a story of life in the slums, told" in the
style of one who is making a first effort,
with all its- smartness and dull results. It
was written by hand and reproduced in
fac-simile; poor handwriting, scratchings,
misspellings and all having evidently nev
er been scanned by the eye of the proof
reader. - â¢ â¢ '> .. -
The author has embellished the mar
gins with what are undoubtedly the poor
est .specimens of drawing that ever went
to print The book worthy of a place
in libraries as an awful warning to would
be authors. Let us profit by the mistakes
of others. (Published by L. C. Page &
Co., Boston. Price $150.)' .
Tales of China.
"Traveler Tales of China," by Hezekiah
Butterworth, is the second in the new
series of the ' "Traveler Tales," written
after the manner of the popular "Zig Zag
Series" which made the name of Heseklah
Butterv.orth a household word wherever
there were hoys and girls- who loved to
read.
"Traveler Tales of China" makes clear
to young people the new conditions, as
well as the old traditions of the Chinese
people, and gives an instructive and fas
cinating picture' of Russian China and
Manchuria, as well as of the central em
pire. It tells all' about the new Dorts of
the Yellow Sea and the Trans-Siberian
Railway, and also illustrates the manners
an* customs of the native population by
folklore tales and travelers' narratives.
The numerous full-page illustrations add
greatly to the value of the work, which
may safely be pronounced one of the most
interesting and useful books for young
people published for many years. (Pub

The Modern Mission Century.
As a result of the sui-lies in world-wide
missions, begun forty yeara agn by Ar
thur T. Pierson. this author offers his
present book. "The Modern Mission Cen
tury Viewed ;is a Cycle of Divine Work
ing." It is a review of the missions of
the nineteenth century with reference to
the superintending providence of God. As
a work of mission history the book is not
without value, but its main object is not
so much to give the annajs of the century
as to find the philosophy of its historyâ
the. center about which all its evtnts re
volve. It studies the men and women,
occurrences and developments, forces and
factors of this hundred years as divinely
appointed and adjusted to this work. It
is especially addressed to students of mis
sionary history and lovers of a world's
evangelization. (Published by the Baker

Her Eoyal Highness Woman.
"Her Royal Highness Woman and His
Majesty Cupid" is a set of essays by
Max O'Rell, recently published by The
Abbey Press, New York. The purpose of
the book is briefly stated in the preface:
"This unpretentious volume of mine will
not have been written in vain if It causes
one married couple in each of the three
countries where it is published to study
and understand each other better.
"I dedWfate it to married men and wo
men and to young men and women con
templating matrimonyâ a large public, in
deed."
Mr. O'Rell closes his preface with a
postscript, which is rather to the point:
"Did I hear you ask whether I have
been married?
"Oh, yes, that's all right."
The book is written In a light and In
teresting vein and the chapters' vary from
"maxims for the man in love" and "max
ims for the married man" to "blondes
and brunettes" and "what is a perfect
lady?".
. His chapters on "the English jvife" and
"the American woman" will probably
awaken some discussion. He Is loud In
his praises of .the American woman, but
deplores the effects -of too much "higher
education." for he _- says American men
are rapidly being forced into a "back
seat." : - V j ;"*":>
Two Books by Orme Agnus.
'Wcssex. stories . seem to be little writ

Two volumes of his have appeared
among- the hosts of Christmas books.
They have a gay and Christmasy look
on the outside, bound as they are fa gor
geous scarlet and gold. It Is certainly
not an appropriate binding, so far as the
contents go, for the stories are not cheer
ful.
"Jan Gather" 13 a novelette, and a very
sad one. It Is the old, old storyâ the same
stcry that "Tess of the D'Urbervilles"
and many another book, great and small,
has handled and will continue to handle
so long as reckless and handsome young
English srulre 1 ? exist to look upon the
charms of foolish and pretty English
peasant maids.
The story of "Jan Oxber** Is a three
fold tragedy, which involves the unhappy
girl, her devoted husband Jan and the
squire upon whom Jan wreaks his venge
ance, thereby earning the gratitude of the
village people who have long suffered
from the arrogance of the line of Deverill.
Old stories are every row and then be
Â¦ ing told in a new way that causes us to
acclaim them new. Agnus has failed to
do this. The story is delicately and
smoothly written, but It lacks grip. You
don't remember it. Furthermore, there
is danger that you won't finish it. for sus
< penseâ that vital organ in the anatomy of
a novelâ is missing. Agnus lacks the art
of carrying you over from chapter to
chapter. He closes his narrative at the
end of each.
But the picture element, is good and ap
parently true. You are thoroughly eon

FOR THE
BUSY MAN
W' ELLIAJI GREEK HAURI
SON, president of the Olym
pic Athletic Club, one of the
best known, and equipped institu
tions of its kind in the world, has
written for The Sunday Call a special
article of greatest interest to all
business and professional men.
Knowing their inability to take
exercise and thus keep themselves in
good bodily condition. Mr. Harrison
lias drawn upon his own experience
in order to benefit them.
Although past 60 years of age. he
is cs energetic and active as a man of
30. His muscles are as elastic and
strong ag a college athlete's. His di
gestive organs are in excellent con
dition and he is able to eat whatever
he desires without suffering after ef
fects. As president of the Olympic
Club, a position to which he has been
fiected three times, he sets an exam
pie that is followed by the members
Every day he visits the gymna
sium of the club aqpi works along
lines prescribed by himself. He doe?
rot tire himself nor does he endangir
has health by overdoing his exercise.
Prominent business and profes
sional men of this city, who are mem
bers of the club, have benefited by the
course of exercise suggested by Mr.
Harrison. He has delivered lectures
en the subject before women's clubs,
snd many of the fair sex have
reached a condition of health by act
ing upon his suggestions.
WILLIAM
GREER
HARRISON
If a person will follow out tne
course prescribed by Mr. Harrison he
can dispense with physicians and
medicines.
George Miehling, wrestling- in
structor of the Olympic Club, has
posed for the various exercises used
by Mr. Harrison. Miehling is a man
cf great strength, and he assures his
friends that he has developed greater
endurance by following the system
taught him by the president of the
club.
THE necessity for exercise on thÂ»
part of business men has been so
often presented that it seems like a
waste of words to recall attention
to the fact. Still, as each ten years
gives us a new set of business men, per
il;:] s thf- missionary effort in the direction
"I rational athletics may find acceptance
where least expected.
Business men should either eat very
lightly nr should exercise very regularly.
Kor the average business men, even with
exercise, one light and one heavy meal a
day should suffice. The man who does
not exercise, and who cats animal food
two or three times a day and fills in with
a large amount of bread, is laying up for
himself at 50 a varied assortment of phys
ical ills. If a man dees not desire to ex
erclfce, or his profession or calling does
not require him to exercise, he should re
duce his eating by 50 per cent.
There is much to be said as to when a
man should eat his first meal. Experience
has decided that a man's stomach Is not
in a condition to take into it any large
amount of food in the early morning
without injury to the digestive system.
Assuming that a man eats breakfast at
S and a lunch at 12 and a dinner at 7
o'clock, and that his dinner is a substan
tial repast of several courses and that he
goes to bed at 11 or 13 o'clock, having
done no work between the last meal and
midnight, he retires with practically a
full stomach. In other words, the fur
nace is full of heated coal and the boiler
Is full of steam. When he awakens at 7
o'clock in the morning he has exhausted
very little of that steam. AH the force
and vitality which his dinner was calcu
lated to give him remain in his system,
and until he has worked three or four
hours, by which time he has reduced the
vitality, he does not need any food. The
business or any other man who leads a
sedentary life should take his first meal
at noon.
When and What to Eat.
Of course, for the laborer or mechanic
other rules may be adopted. But I am
speaking now of business men. Let us
Tommy Atkins and His War Buttons
THE British War Office, which, on
occasions in time past, has won
glory and renown for the masterly
knowledge of military affairs it has
displayed, is in deep trouble. This trou
ble is not caused by the elusive Boers or
by any other enemies of the King, but by
âbuttons.
Only buttons, but it might just as well
have been guns.
When the King ascended the throne
some one discovered that it was neces
sary to change the buttons of the British
army.
There happened to be a little war in
South Africa at the timeâ and there is
stillâ but it paled at once into nothing
ness beside this question of buttons.
For several weeks the clerks of several
THE SUNDAY CALL.
see what is the ordinary method of the
average business man in feeding. He rises
say at 7 and breakfasts at 7:00 or S
o'.clock. He eats two or three eggs, per
haps two or thee slices of bacon, prob
ably a basin of mush, probably a quan
tity of fruit and drinks several cups of
coffee. He rides to his office, smoking :i
israr. He takes no exerciseâ does practi
cally no physical work. At 12 o'clock he
saunters off to his club, where lie takas
a meal pretty nearly equal to that which
kVuuld he eaten by a laboring man. returns
to his office, where he remains until s:uO,
takes his street car home, as he took i:
down and as h*. took it to lunch, takes i
Cocktail or two ami at 6:::o or 7 o'clock
sits down to an elaborate dinner. He
smokes three or four cigars, perhaps
takes a highball or two and feeling
sleepy from an excess of food he goes to
bed at 10:3u or 11 o'clock. The result of
this method of eating is that there is al
ways a lot of undigestei food in the
stomachâ always the presence of a large
amount ol gas. and always the material
for a variety of diseases.
A Light Breakfast.
Now let us take the other side of the
luestion. The man who gets up at 7
D'cloek takes twenty minutes' exercise, a
cold bath and then walks to his office,
having drunk a glass or more of hot
water before leaving the house, can get
through his whole day's work between
the hours of 8 and 12 without any strain
upon his system. At 12 o'clock he haÂ«
an appetite, wuch he will wisely not
gratify. He w'U take a basin of fruit,
preferably prunes, poached eggs and
shredded wheat bread and a cup of ce
real coffee. And he will not eat any
thing more until 6:30 o'clock. At that
hour he will take a bowl of well cookei
soup, a little fish, a cut oÂ£ roast mutton
or roast beef or a chop or a steak, some,
baked apples and a cup of black coffes.
He will smoke a cigar, and after an hour
and a half he is in condition to do an
other day's work if it is necessary.
Now for those who think they cannot
go to work without some breakfast, let
then begin by taking the lightest amount
of breakfast and they will soon be able
â¢ to see how perfectly they can do without
a heavy meal.
The purpose of exercises are easily
enough explained. The important -thing
departments spent their spare time be
tween lunch and 4 o'clock in feverish act
ivity.
Notes had to be written, copied, dock
eted, tied up with red tape and filed.
Pourparlers were exchanged between de
partments.
Men who could not be stirred by mere
battles found their veins tingling with ex
citement over buttons.
Several inventors of new and ingenious
buttons calculated to strike terror into the
hearts of the King's enemies were chased
down Pall Mall, and other things were
done to prove that the War Office really
had this great question in hand.
At last a truce between contending de
partment?, each anxious to prove its effi
ciency and ability in this momentous mat
ter, was arrived at. One button was
in any exercise is the vibration of tho
whole system, the increase of the circu
lation of the blood and the consequent
elimination through the pores of the skin
of all matter rejected by the blood. It
ought not to require any argument to
convince any rational man that if nature
declares that the waste matter in our sys
tem shall be got rid or, the process
of eliminationâ the natural process â is as
necessary as the washing of the hands,
the face and the body. If a man must
oat largely he must exercise largely, ami
the exercise being equivalent a man can
practically eat and drink whatever he
likes. But if a man wants to preserve
his form and the elasticity of his muscles
and the capacity for hard work he will
tat nothing that he cannot properly di
gest. Every man should by some method
perspire freely every day.
To come down to the practical side of ,
this question. What exercise should a
business man take? Well, a business man .
thinks he is very busy. He really is not,
but he thinks so. Going to a club and
getting a lot of mechanical exercise re
quires an amount of moral courage which .
he does not seem to possess. The cry of
the mus-xlc-s for exorcise is silenced by
the argument. "No time, no time. " Well,
every business man has eventually to iind
time to die. and a great mauy of them
have been practically dead for years.
Crime of Inaction.
Going into an assemblage of business
men is very much like going into a con
valescent ward, as every other man you
meet has a complaint and solicits your
sympathy. A man's business should be
the servant of his necessities and he
should not be the servant of his business.
The man who neglects exercise is com
mitting crime against himself, and he is
doing a serious injury to the community
in 'which he lives because he is a battery
of disease, transmitting from his own
person to others the germs of disease
which he himself has set in motion. To
overcome the difficulty about gymnasium
work a form of exercise which every busi
ness man can take if he will in his own
house has been devised. It would ba bet
ter if he took it in the gymnasium be
cause of the additional light and addir
tional air u:id the cubic space fur breath
ing purposes that a gymnasium affords.
In a gymnasium he would have the rivalry
which grows out of companionship. It' a
half dozen gentlemen choose to exercise
in a class, the prospects of continuing thÂ«
exercise would be greater than where the
work is taken up individually. But
chosen and sent to the King, who at
once signified his approval.
A?an the great machine moved. Or
ders were sent to manufacturers, and by
thousands the buttons began to return
to the army clothing people at Pimlico.
But, a!as! a mistake had been made.
After all the buttons over which strong
men had fought and wept were not sent
to the makers.
By a "regrettable accident" a wrong de
sign found its way to Sheffield, and $5000
worth were made before the mistake was
discovered. N
Business men might have found a use
for those buttons, but Pall Mall, with
its truly paternal regard for the least
important details of Tommy's equipment,
sent them all straight back to the melting
pot.
whether taken in the house or gymna
sium, the following method of exercise
would ?ivt to every business man a con
dition of health and strength which would
make his work a pleasure and his life a
joy.
How to Breaths.
The average man does not know how to
breathe. He does not. know that nature
has t rnvided him with a pump called the
diaphragm, and that by using that pump
he can suck in in one breath about five
times as much air as he does by his pres
ent erroneous method. To-day when a
man breathes he draws the abdomen back.
To breathe properly he should throw the
abdomen forward. He should breathe al
ways through the nostrils with his mouth
clost-fi. At present he breathes through
the mouth. By long, deep breathing,
i;.-in>: the diaphragm as a pump, a man
can so buttress with muscles the upper por
tion of his body that he can maintain at
all times an erect position without fatigue.
In nthf r words, by developing fhe muscles
of the abdomen the muscles over the hips
and around the small of the back he cre
ates a wall upon which the upper portion
of the body rests. He protects the
and he protects the stomach. The process
of deep breathing and the muscular effort
r quired in breathing will rid him of that
parent of a thousand evils, constipation,
f,nd will also assist digestion and prevent
the collection of gases in the stomach.
Th:* simile system of deep breathing will
greatly increase the chest expansion.
Every deer> breath taken adds to the air
cell? in the lungs, increasing the size and
the working value of the lungs and cor
respondingly improving the health. Deep
breathing again In itself materially im
proves the circulation, a matter of vital
importance.
Where a man's muscle? in the region
referred to have become flabby and weak,
there is a sagging down of the whole of
the upper portion of his body, bringing the
weight of his head, shoulders and cheat
as a pressure upon the vital organs.
Building Up the Muscles.
Now we come to the process of elimina
tion, and the building up the muscles of
the body from the base of the skull to
the sole of the feet. The old method,
which had a lot of good in it (but which
.like many other old methods is gradually
passing away) aimed at giving men large
and highly developed bunches of muscle
which were neither necessary nor orna
mental. A later method is to develop the
muscles in such a way that they are only
seen as the muscles of a tiger or a lion
or race horse are seen â when in action.
'When relaxed the muscles should pre
sent no evidence of excessive strength.
The strength will be there, but it will be
in the quality of the muscles rather than
in, the quantity.
Correct Way of Standing.
We take up the first exercise, which is
the setting of the body in the natural
position. The old school taught: shoulders
pulled back, the stomach pulled in. and
the chest poked out, which is an unnat
ural position. The natural position for a
man standing is to lean slightly forward
on the balls of the feet, the little finger
of his palm touching the center of his
leg. with the shoulders slightly forward,
chest and stomach in the natural posi
tion. Should you take a man standing
in that position and put heavy weights
on his shoulders you will find that the
body will retain the position. Under the
old method he would be compelled to ex
ercise some form of balance to prevent
pressure on the spine and to maintain the
erect position.
The first movement is intended to de
velop the muscles of the arms and sides.
That movement is simply the raising of
the hands over the head with all the mus
cles of the body and arms tense. The
arms are swung rapidly up and down
over the head but never below or behind
the shoulder, the Idea being never at any
time to strain the chest. In this move
ment there are three motions, palms to
the front, palms upward, palms down,
and the movement is repeated five times
to the breath, the breath, being held dur
ing each movement. The second position
*5 similar to the first with the difference
that the knees are slightly bent, the fin
gers are locked in front, and the locked
hands swung- over the head up and down
five times to a breath. This movement
increases the muscular force of the back,
thighs, and necessarily the arms and
shoulders.
The Swimming Exercise.
The next exercise is a series of what is
called swimming movements, which are
for the purpose of developing tie muscle*
of the chest, the back and arms. The
hands are crossed and brought upward
under the chin, with the elbows in line
with the shoulders. The hands are then
thrown straight to the front, then out
ward risht and left In line with the
shoulders, then brought back to the front
and then back to the position under thÂ«
chin. In this exercise there are three
movementsâ the palm down, the palms
turned inward and the palms turned up
ward. This is called the swimming
movement and exercises all the muscles
of the upper portion of the body.
In the next movement the position is
the same as No. 1, with the legs bent.
The hands are swung up over the head
from the sides alternately. This exer
cises all the side muscles of the body, the
front muscles of the legs and the calves,
because of the pressure on them.
The next movement is what is called
the rocking movement. The body Is erect,
as in the first position, and is fbeked right
and left. This has a tendency to strength
en the back and side muscles.
In the next movement the hands are
raised over the head, palms out. The
body is brought slowly down until ..a*
knuckles touch the floor.
The next movement Is the same, with
this difference, that you come back to
the original position of extended arms
with : each change. In the third move
ment the hands are raised over the head,
the body is turned to the right and slow
ly bent until the knuckles touch the floor;
the body is brought to the erect position
and then the movement is repeated to the ,
left. In the next position ths hands are I
stretched out in line with the shoulders,
the heels apart. The movement Is In rap-
Idly squatting by bringing the body down
upon the heels, carrying the hands over
the head at the same time.
High Stepping to Reduce Fat.
The next exercise Is nigh stepping with
the knee. The knees are raised rapidly
to the chest. This is a splendid exercise
for the muscles of the stomach and the
stomach itself. The muscles of the thighs.
calves of the legs and lower back are
greatly strengthened by this exercise. In
the sitting exercise the hands are brought
up over the bead and the head, shoulders
and hands are brought down as close to
the feet as possible. .This develops
strength in the back, reduces any fat over
the abdomen and is an excellent substitu
tion for rowing.
In the final movement the hands are
stretched out in line with the shoulders;
the hands are brought rapidly together in
front of the body, repeating the move
ment with a change by turning palma
out, down and up.
These exercises if taken for fifteen min
utes a day. with a cold sponge, cold show
er or tub immediately after the ?x
ercise, will reduce all unnecessary ab
dominal fat and will replace it with mus
cle the texture of steel wire*.

HERE is a strange story of the
remarkable hulkâ the Tropic
", *i Bird. The old wreck has for
years been a landmark on the beach

on it and families live there. Stranger
yet. the granddaughter of the original

vedere, and later, years after, became

in and year out a mysteryâ a mys
tery that has oeen in their midst for over
thirty years and they have not solved it.
Had it not been that, after all, this
world is so small and that events force
themselves upon us nowadays with such
rapidity that we are getting accustomed
to them. It Is probable that this mystery
Â¦wouid have remained one until the end
of time for the very good reason that no
one has bothered for thirty years to
EOlv* it.
â¢ â¢ â¢
In the spring of 1850, on a fine Sunday
morning:, the good ship Tropic Bird, Cap
tain Homans skipper, set sail from Glou
cester, Mass., with a cargo of general
produce, bound for the Golden Gate.
He had aboard a mixed crewâ men who
had roughed it all their lives and men
that hadn't, seafaring men and landlub
bers, all having but one hope, one ideaâ
.the far-famed poM fields of California.
They were willing to take the risk and â¢
chances of the seven months at sea, with
the possible horrors of the rounding of
the Horn, if they could only once get to
the coveted land, the land flowing with
milk and honey, the land of gold.
A good, true ship was the Tropic Bird,
end a good, true man her skipper, who
had with him his brother. . .
One day is very much like another, on
a long voyage when the wind holds good
and the weather is fair, but there came
a time when the ominous murmur, a
mere whisper, gathering force each day.
the echo of mutinous discontent, caugh.
the quick ears of the young captain and
his ever-watchful brother.
The cargo was a valuable one. They
were on the high seas. If the crew
stood together against two men they were
as nothing in their hands.
Action, quick action, was their only
safeguard- For a time they waited anJ
watched like lynxes. They sifted thj
good from the bad; they placed the good
with the bad in the watches.
The mutineers were, they discovered,
headed by" a J-arge, heavy-set Dutchman,
and he had more than half the craw with
him.
It was an anxious time. They.weie
Hearing the critical point of the voyage â
the rounding of the Horn and the
weather was freshening.
The men were doing their work sullen-,
ly, the "esprit de corps" had gone, and
those true to their young skipper were
doing double duty on half-time sleep.
There could be only one end to such a
state of affairs.
One morning Captain Homans was sud
denly seized with griping pains, followed
by vomiting. Their knowledge of medi
cine was small, but they soon realize i
that their coffee had been tampered with,
and as they s.'Jt in the captain's cabin
they eyed one another fearfully, the-â.
two brothers, practically alone wit.i
would-be murderers.
They held a council of war, the result be
ir.g: that the crew was cailed aft and the
captain delivered himself of a tew well
chosen, full of ginger, .spicy sentences.
There had been a foul attempt to tak >
his life that very morning. Would the
crew jibe together or would they not?
If They Mould, let bygones be bygones.
If not, by the Almighty, he would clay
every mutineer in irons and work the
ehip round short handed.
Matters were quieter for a day or two.
the crew worked better and less sullen
ly, but it was the calm before the storm,
and one night the cloud burst.
There was a loud cry from the first
mate, and in v. second it seemed as if
every one was in the scrimmage. Breaths
came hard. There were muttered curse?
as a knife went home.
The captain rushed on deck half dress
ed. Dutch Dick had just dispatched his
man. and with a curse was on him. Now
the captain, though light, was strong
as a bull, a famous wrestler, even at
that age. and knew every trick of the
trade. The Dutchman was enormous.
big. heavy, Elouchy. It was an even
thing.
Captain Homans ducked under a vicious
thrust and got the giant round waist and
arms. They tugged and twisted, they
clipped and fell, they rolled over, b.ut the
captain never let go that hold, for to
yield was death. They were up again
and the hold could last no longer. Like
a flash he changed it. He caught the
gasping Dutchman by his belt, got his
left arm and shoulder under his leg and
threw him over his head.
The captain fell on him with all his
force and stunned him.
It was an intervention of Providence
that brought the storm, in all its force,
on that howlinqr, cursing, yelling mob of
mad devils, mad with the lust of gain,
thirsty for blood.
There was a bright, piercing flash, the
sharp battalion crack, crack of thunder.
The Eton* was on them. No time now
for murder and rapine. It was a battle
against the elements. Each man to his
post.
The captain was up roaring orders to
his men. Those who could obeyed.
Mr.ny of them limped to their duty.
Dutch Dick, recovering quickly from his
heavy fall, subdued, conquered, got
quickly to work, and the making of all
ship shape to meet .he storm began.
One danger was over, beaten out of ex
. istcnee by anothe". The crew worked
with a will to save their own skins.
These who were too disabled to work
cured their own wounds as best they

DO YOU KNOW WHY WE ARE RIGHT-HANDED?
WHY are men as a rule right

Many theories are given In an

in course of lons years of only partial em

pointed out thai, almost all Infants are at
first left-handed, .and for a very simple
reason. -.. In " the ordinary way a mother
or a nurse, unless left-handed, carries a
baby with its bead against her left side
and with its right' arm next her. The
baby consequently puts its left hand out
to grasp objects, and grows up left-hand

who puts out a left in greeting or who

many years, yet "Kismet" brought them
at its given hour together.
What did Mrs. Scott know about "The
Tropic Bird?" The little woman sat be
fore them with her big, bouncing boy on
her lap and told them all she knew.
About thirty years before a certain Mr.
Bichard had seen the old hulk lying at the
foot of Telegraph Hill and bargaining for
her had bought her for a mfere song. He
then had her towed over to what, is now
beautiful Belvedere, cut her in half and
built a house where the stern had been.

as a contractor and builder, the other as
a coal merchant.

Sir James Sawyer, M. D., has probably
hit upon the most plausible reason for the
right-handedness of the | human race. In
those early days, he says, when those
might take who had the power and those
might keep who could, we were a fighting
people, and. a people who fought. hand to
hand. Naturally in this kind of fighting
it is most convenient to wield a - weapon
which can be used by one hand only,
leaving 1 the other . hand , and arm free for
preserving balance, for defensive . cover
ing and' for offensive seizing. . .-; Â¦Â¦
Nov. the right hand would naturally be
used in preference to the left for wielding
a weapon, in order that the heart might
be kept as far away, as possible from the
assault of an adversary- Hence right
handedness arose and was passed on from
father. to son. Â¦-â¢. -i - Â¦Â¦ â¢ Â¦'Â¦-.Â¦ -: .-- Â¦ Â¦ Â¦â¢".
Moreover, when men first fought togeth

found that it was most convenient to han

some in a fighting company were right
handed and others were left-handed their

"Now," she continued, "we have often
wondered if this 'Tropic Bird' is the one
my grandfather built. Donald Dewar was
his name, and he was a shipbuilder up in
Georgetown. Prince Edward Island. He
turned out two ships in about \&2j. and one
of them was 'The Tropic Bird.' "
Her listeners were all excitement. "Did
your grandfather sell 'The Tropic Bird?' "
asked one. "Yes," came the answer, "to
a gentleman in Gloucester, Mass. Grand
father thought she was unlucky, for even
the rats wouldn't stay with her, so he
sold her."
TherÂ« was a moment's silence. It was
all so wonderful. There sat five people,

WILLIAM JARDINE.THE MOST FAMOUS
CENTENARIAN OF
THE WEST
FROM timÂ« to time we hear of per
sons who attain a century of age,
but they are usually those who
have passed very quiet and une
ventful lives and have done little
to wear out their natural strength. It is
very rare that a man of distinguished
character and active life reaches such ex
treme age. This rule is broken in the case
of General Jose Maria Chavez, who be
et .me 100 years old on Wednesday, Sep
tember 25. He has been in extremely ac
tive life all his days, and has held more
official positions, and under more govern
ments, than any other man in the United
I. He has lived and held office un
der three governments, not by moving
from one country to another, but by hav
:.e government over him change
while he has lKed continuously in one

General Chavez was born in the town
of Santa Clara, on the banks of the Rio

Banta Fe, on the 25th day of September,

the fact that San Francisco is gaining

all is the fog. the shining, silvery mist,
"half concealing, half revealing," moving
fantastic shadows of soft light through
which even a telegraph pole takes on
grace and the awkward appearing three

Charles Robinson says. "The fog is the
true sentiment of San Francisco." But

His great-great-great-grandfather was
Don Fernando Duran y Chavez, who cairn*
from Spain to Mexico and was a captain
in the brilliant company of cavaliers wh)
accomplished the reconquest of New Mex
ico in 1692 under the celebrated Don Diego
de Vargas. The Chavez family is an
ancient one among the Spanish hidalgo-?.
It appears that it was originally written
"Llaves" (Keys), a surname given by tlio
King cf Spain to a certain Don Nulfo for
his wonderful gallantry in the capture of
a Moorish town, of which he presented
the keys to his sovereign.
The Chavez iamily settled at a plae*
at first namrrl after them. Los Chavez,
and now known as Atrisco. Here the
father of General Chavez, Francisco An
tonio Chavez, was born and lived for a
number of years, but ultimately moved
north, and Â«rai sojourning at the Indian
pueblo of Santa Clara at the time of the
birth of his illustrious son. Four years

condition which has existed only lends
strength to the hackneyed remark, "That
one must first go to Europe before he is
appreciated at home," a reputation truly
not to be courted. San Franciscans are
surely capable of saying such and such a
work is meritorious without first looking
at the tag attached by the committee of
the Paris salon.
This year more than ever before there
will be an opportunity to observe the
strength of our artist element, for the
studio doors are barred, inquisitive vis
itors knock in vain; there is work going
onâ work whien promises to make this
December exhibition one of the best San
Francisco has had for years, for this is
the club where men of money, the lovers
and patrons of art congregate, wine, dine,
criticise, and what is more important, put
their hands in their pocketsâ the re
sult being many cheerful looking* lritle
tickets marked "sold" being tacked about,
and during the exhibitions . congratula
tions reverberating through the hall. It
is small wonder then that the best is al
ways reserved for this which opens the
first week in December. The finishing
touches have been put on the water colors
for the Hopkins exhibition, which opens
Thursday, November 7. with a display of
water color, pastel and black and white.
The committee decided to exclude all oils
this year, and. therefore, it is expected
that the collection of the above named

Abiquiu, then an Indian village, situated
on a high bluff which rises from the river
valley, and which is still known In the
Â¦vicinity as "The Pueblo" on account of
Its Indian origin, though it has been mi
important Spanish town for many years.
Here General Chavez has passed thj
whole of his active life, living there con
tinuously for ninety-six yo;ir?.
Abiquiu was a frontier settlement, the
farthest advanced ot Spanish colonisation,
and directly on the line of the almost con
stant invasions of the wild Indian tribes
âthe Utes. Apaches. Navajos, Kiowas
and Comanohes. Until some years after
the American occupationâ indeed, until
after 1865. the people in the settlement*
outside of the Rio Grande Valley were
nevei safe from attack, and even in the
valley itself there were raids almost every
year which carried off vast numbers of
cattle and sheep and considerable num
bers of prisoners, mostly children. It is
Mr. Cadenasso, besides a few pastels rep
resenting one of his favorite and most
successful subjects, the stately etica
lypti, has finished a tempera painting,
something comparatively new in San
Francisco, although this revival of the
early Italian school has been noticeable
in the European galleries this year past.
The method consists principally in using
a preparation j>; egg for dilution in place
of oil, the result being superb coloring,
which does not darken and deaden with
age. This fact is significant in the work
of some of the old masters, whose can
vases, with the passing of all these years,
still retain their brilliancy.
Cadenasso has in this "old new" school
achieved a splendid result, and the tem
pera, one of the first to be exhibited here,
will, no doubt, cause considerable com
ment.
Harry Fondr- has sett nothing to the
Hopkins, but may have a few canvases
for the club. He has found Monterey a
good field for work, and is proving his al
legiance to the adobes and p+nes by pack
ing his trunk and departing for another
year, at the termination of which he wl^l
go to Florence.
Charles Dickmnn has deserted his cozy
little Monterey cottage; that is. for a few
months, and is more than busy on the
portraits of several handsome million
aires. Mr. Dk-kman will havo some Brit
tany fisher folk, and we hope a moonlight,
for there la a canvas in his studio which
makes one wish that more moonlights
from his brush would be forthcoming.
Orin Peck has a number pf good' things
for this exhibition, several of which have
never been shown before. The large can

exceptionally strong piece of work, which
received commendation from the Euro
pean authorities, was recently the most
talked about picture of the October

marked "Captive" meaning that they
had been curried off as captives by the
marauding Indian bands. The frontier
settlements were frequently abandoned
for years, until a partial cessation of hos

venturesome company of settlers caused
them to be reoccupiedi The inhabitants,
from curliest youth, were bred to arms
and w( re always ready to repel an at

the marauders by a counter invasion. In
the vicinity of Abiquiu are still seen a
number of half-ruined "torreones," the
round towers which were built as lookout
stations from which the approach of the
hostile Indians could be seen and the set
tlers called to arms.
Young Chavez, from his earliest days,
developed a strong military genius, ani
was soon recognized as a leader among
his people. Before the success of the

this year will be a welcome addition to
the club.
E. W. Currier, a comparative stranger
in our midst, is doing some exceptionally
fine work in both water color and oil. Mr.
Currier spent the summer in Monterey
making studies of the adobes. There is a
warmth of feeling in* his work that is
seldom seen in water color; the China

prominent Californians. has been received

which a trip to Paris is in contemplation.

HELD THREE OFFICES UNDER FERDINAND VII, KING OF SPAIN, BEFORE 1822.

WAS COMMANDER IN CHIEF.

Mexican revolution in 1522 he had held
three offices under the Spanish King Fer
dinand VII, and had seen active service
both In defensive and offensive -war. His
first position was that of lieutenant in
the "urban militia": from this he was
promoted to be captain of a battalion,
"capitan de escuadron," and was soon
afterward made an adjutant in the army.
All this before he waÃ 22 years of age.
The change in government caused by
Mexican independence made little differ
ence In the frontier experiences of the
New Mexicans of that- day. The Indian
invaders cared not at all whether King
Ferdinand, the Emoeror Iturbide or a
rÂ«Duhlican President claimed allegi-
ance of the Spanish settlers, captain
Chavei was now a tall young man, with
a black beard, piercing eyes, and a grow
ing reputation as a bold, skillful and suc
cessful Indian lighter. During the quar
ter of a century of Mexican Government
lie was gradually promoted in rank until
he became a colonel, then "Military In
spector of the frontiers of Abiquiu. Ojo
Caliente and El Rito." and finally a brig
adier general.
The Nnvajos and the Utes were the
wors-t enemies of this part of New Mex
ico, the Apaches and Comanches being
most dangerous on the east of the moun
tains; and, besides being constantly on
the watch to repel invasions. General
Cliawz. in the course of his life, took
par! In no less than eleven regular cam
paigns against the Indians, and in rive of
them he was commander in chief. Thtse
camraigr.b consisted of invasions of the
Indian country In order to inflict punish
ment on the marauding tribes, to recap
ture and release prisoners and recover the
animals and other booty that had been
carried away, and they usually resulted
also in the capture < ' mmib. rof In
dian boys and giro, who were distributed
among the settlers as servants. These
expeditions penetrated into Arizona, Colo
rado and Utah, wherever the offending
tribe happened to be. The last of these
campaigns under Mexican authority was
against the Utes in 1545, and may be de
scribed as an illustration of the general
character of all of them.
The Utes having been more insolent and
troublesome than usual, it was determ
ined by the Governor of the Department
of New Mexico to organize a campaign
of invasion for their punishment, and on
the 31st of May Juan Andres Archulete.
then adjutant general, sent to General
Chavez his commission as commander in
chief, and at the same time dispatched
orders to the prefects of the th.'cc dis
tricts into which New Mexico was then
divided, to furnish a thousand men for the
purpose, including one hundred regular
troops, all to rendezvous at Taos on July
19. On June 14 elaborate instructions for
the conduct of the campaign were issued.
The little army marched north into what
is now Colorado, and the Utes fled before
them. Finally the Indians approached the
Napeste River, now called the Arkansas.
and as that -was the boundary line be
tween Mexico and the United States.
General Chavez sent a messenger to the
Governor at Santa Fe to ask whether he
could pursue them within American ter
ritory, but was instructed that that could
not be done: and so he returned after
driving them across the river and de
stroying ail the goods which they hail
left. Fur his services in this and other
campaigns he receiver! fronj the Mexican
Government a magnificent sword, which
is one of the highly prized ornaments cf
his home at Abicuiu.
He was a man of very great personal
bravery, and scores of anecdotes are cur
rent as to his fearlessness and daring. It
i-= said that at one time when a band o*
Indians invaded the Spanish settlements
Chavez raised a company and pursued
t.iem. but so far outran his men that
when he came in sight of the enemy ho
was entirely alone. But without any
hesitation he' rode into their camp at full
speed, and created such consternation
that the entire party fled, leaving all of
their arms and provisions on the ground.
But General Chavez's talents were not
confined to military operations. Under the
Mexican rule he was Alcalde for four
yean and Prefect of the Northern Ju
risdiction for a long period, this latter po
sition being the most important civil of
fice north cf Sant? Fe.
After the American occupation under
General Kearney he became a citizen of
the United States and served under the
new government in many official capac-i
i - F " 1 the beginning of the Terri
tcria. Government he was a brigadier
r
general of militia and continued as such
for a number of years. He was seven
times a member of the Territorial Legis
lature, his large experience being of great
value in that body. In ISSI he was ap
pointed by Governor James S. Calhoun
prefect of the county of Rio Arriba. In
1853 he was commissioned by Governor
David Merriweather as Probate Judge of
the same county, he having been elected
to that office, and he served three terms
in ihis position. When the rebellion
broke out he was found, like almost all
New Mexicans, ready to serve under the
stars and stripes, and on August 9. 1861,
was commissioned by Governor Rencher
lieutenant colonel ..f a volunteer mounted
regiment, called into the service of the
fnited States. In fart, he has commis
sions enough under the three Government*
to paper an ordinary room, or. if framed,
to decorate an entire house. Hi 3 last com
mission was given to him by Governor
Axtell in September. 1575. when he was
just 74 years old, and appointed him
School Commissioner of Rio Arr*ba
County.
One of his most famous campaigns,
however, was made without any regular
commission whatever, in 1860 the Indiana
had become almost insupportable; the
savages liacl attacked villages in the very
center of the Territory, and even carried
off cattle from the outskirts of Sajita Fe.
Neither the civil nor the military author
ities afforded protection, and. in despair,
the leading citizens held a convention and
determined to raise a volunteer army and
inflict such punishment on the Navajos
as to prevent further trouble. Every
county was called on for its proportion
and General Chavez was made lieutenant
colonel, the chief command in the field
being given to his cousin. Don Manuel
Chavez, also a renowned Indian fighter.
The men assembled at San Isidro, eaeii
mounted on his own horse, and they
marched into the midst of the enemy 3
country, far across the Arizona line, in
flicting such punishment that it was
never forgotten. In this campaign Gen
eral Chavez gained fresh laurels and the
newspapers of that day contain a num
ber of verses dedicated to him and re-
counting his deeds of bravery, the first
being as follows: '
El Teniente Coronel.
Del condado del Rio Arriba A .
Es distinguido hombre flel:
Gritemos todos oue viva!" -
The Chavez residence, where General
Chavez has lived for almost a century, is
one of those spacious buildings construct
ed around an open "placita," or court
yard, and covering almost an acre of
ground, which are characteristic of the
old Spanish families. It stands on the
brow of a high and almost perpendicular
bluff, which commands a view of the en
tire valley of the Chama River for many
miles, and was a place easily defensible
in the days when that was a very impor
tant consideration. It is surrounded by
fruit trees of all kinds and with a multi
tude of outhouses and corrals for the ac
commodation of livestock of all descrip
tions, among which must not be forgotten
a number of peacocks which proudly dis
play their gorgeous plumage in the won
derful brightness of New Mexican sun
shine on the tops of adobe walls and the
branches of rreat trees.
The cnildren of General Chavez live on
ranches in the vicinity of their father, so
that family reunions are not unusual. He
has three sonsâ Patricio. who lived
for a number of years in California, but
now resides on the north side of th^
Chama River. near Abiquiu: Jose
Maria C. Chavez, who lives in the eld
homestead, extending loving care to his
venerable father: Francisco C, who ha.s.
a fine ranch a few miles to the west, and
two daughters, the wives respectively of
Ignacio L. Ortiz and Jesus Maria Vigil,
who live at Abiquiu and El Rlto. Ot
Â¦grandchildren and great-grandchildren he
has a goodly number and thus he lives
like an ancient patriarch surrounded by
his descendants.

GRAUSTARK THE STORY OF A LOVE BEHIND
THE THRONE
Synopsis.
Grenfall Lorry, a young mar, of wealth and
position, while traveling on the Denver Express
has his interest suddenly awakened in a re
markably attractive young: woman who is /Â»â¢
her uncle and aunt. He is puzzling his brain
for a wav to make her acquaintance when the
opportunity offers Itself by the train acciden
tally leaving them both in a small town of
the "mountain district. Lorry wires ahead and
by hiring a team manages, after a romantic
drive, to catch the train at the next station.
By this means he manages to become quite
friendly with the party. He is rather dis
concerted to find that so lovely a creature
should have the name of "Gusgenslocker. He
hopes to see more of them, for he learns that
they will stop over a day in Washington, where
Lorry lives. Arriving at the station they get
out before he is dressed, and he fears that he
has missed them. He finds them again, how
rver, but only to show them around the Capitol
for a few brief hours, and then to say good-by.
He receives an -invitation to visit Kdelweiss.
CHAPTER Vâ Continued.
BKKTIMEXTAL EXCHANGE.
THE memory of that last tender hand
clasp and the soft glow in her eyes
stood like a wall between the fear
that she had forgotten and the cer
tainty that she remembered. Had not
this memory kept him awake? That and
the final, mysterious emotion which had
sh^krn itself in her face as he had last
looked upon it? A thousand times had
he pondered over that startled look and
â¢the signs of agitation. Was it fear? Was
it dismay? Was it renunciation? What
ever it was. it sorely disturbed him: it
had partly undone the charm of the mo
ment beforeâ the charm that could not
and would not be gainsaid.
True to his intention, he went to the
office early, virtuously inclined to work.
His uncle greeted him warmly and a long
conference over business affairs fol
lowed. To Lorry's annoyance and dis
comfiture, he found himself frequently
inattentive. Several important cases
Â¦were pending, end in a day or two they
were to go to court with a damage suit
of more than ordinary consequence.
Lorry, senior, could not repress his grati
fication over the return of his clever, ac
tive nephew at sue an opportune time.
He felt himself unable to handle the case
alone: the endurance of a young and
vigorous jnind was required for the com
ing battle in chancery.
They lunched together, the elder eager
and confidential, the other respectful and
â abser.t-mir>deJ. In the afternoon the
junior went over the case, and renewed
search for authorities and opinions, fully
determined to be constant in spite of his
inclination to be fickle. ' Late in the day
he petulantly threw aside the books.
curtly informed his astonished uncle that
lie was not feeling well, and left the
sffice. Until dinner time he played bil
liards atrociously at his club; at dinner
his mother sharply reproved him for fla
grant inattentions; after dinner he
smoked and -wondered despondently. To
morrow she must sail: If he could but
see her once more!
At 7:30 his mother found him in the
library, searching diligently through the
volume of the encyclopedia that con
tained the G'e. When she asked him what
he was looking for he laughed idiotically,
and, in confusion, informed her that he
â¢was trying to find the name of the most
important city in Indiana. She was
glancing at the books in the case when
she was startled by hearing him utter an
exclamation and then leap to his feet.
"Half past seven! I can make it!"
"What is the matter, Gren, dear?"
"Oh!" he ejaculated, bringing himself up
Â¦with a start. "I â erâ yes. mother,
I'll just have time to catch the train, you
know. Will you kindly have Mary clean
up this muss of books and so forth? I'm
off, you see, to New Yorkâ for a day only,
motherâ to-morrow! Important busi
nessâJust remember it, you knowâ
Good-by, mother! Good-by!" He had
kissed her and was in the hall before she
fairly understood what he was talking
about. Then she ran after him, gaining
the hallway in time to see him pass
through the street door, his hat on the
side of his head, his overcoat fluttering
furiously as he shoved his arms into the
sleeves. The door slammed and he was
off to New York.
The train was ready to pull out when he
reached the station, and it was only by a
hard run that he caught the last platform,
panting but happy. Just twenty-four
hours before she had left Washington and
it was right here that she had smiled and
said she would expect him to come to
Edelweiss. He had had no time to secure
a berth in the sleeper, but was fortunately
able to get one after taking the train.
Grenfall went to sleep feeling both dis
appointed and disgusted. Disappointed
because of his submission to sentiment,
disgusted because of the man who occu
pied the next section. A man who is in
love and In doubt has no patience with
the prosaic wretch who can sleep so
audibly.
After a hasty breakfast in New York he
telephoned to the steamship company's
pier and asked the time of sailing for the
Kaiser Wilhelm. On being Informed that
the ship was to cast off at her usual hour
he straightway called a cab and was soon
bowling along toward the busy waterway
Directly he sat bolt upright, rigid and
startled to find himself more awakened to
the realization of his absurd action. Again
it entered his infatuated head that he
was performing the veriest schoolboy
trick in rushing to a steamship pier in the
hope of catching a final, and at best un-
l tlS i aC i Ory glimpse of a young woman
who had appealed to his sensitive admir
ation. A lovesick boy could be excused
for such a display of Imbecility, but a
manâ a man of the world! Never!
"The Idea of chasing down "to the
water', edge to see that girl is -enough
to make you ashamed of yourself for life
Grenfall Lorry.- he apostrophized "It's
worse than any love-sick fool ever
dreamed of doing. I am blushing, I'll
be bound. The idiocy of the thing! And
suppose she should see me staring at
her out there on the pier? What would
the think of me? I'll not go another foot-
I won't be a fool."
He #as excited and self-conscious and
thoroughly ashamed of the trip into
which his impetuous adoration had driven
him. Just as he was tugging at the
door In the effort to open it that he
might order the driver to take him back
to the hotel, a sly tempter whispered
something in his ear; his fancy was
caught, and he listened:
"Why not go down to the pier and look
over the passenger list, just to see if she
has been booked safely? That would be
perfectly proper and sensible, and besides
it will be a satisfaction to know that she
lets off all right. Certainly! There's
nothing foolish in that. . . . Especially
as I am right on the way there.
And as I have come so far ... there's
no sense in going back without seeing
whether she has ; secured passage.
I can find out in a minute and then go
home. . . . There won't be anything
wrong in that. And then I may have a
glimpse of her before the ship leaves the
pier. She must not see xne, of course.
Never! She'd laugh at me: How I'd
hate to see her laughing at me!" Then,
sinking back again with a smile of justi
fication on his face, he muttered: "We
won't turn back; we'll go right ahead.
We'll be a kind of a fool, but not so
foolish as to allow her to see us and
recognize* us as one."
Before long they arrived at the wharf,
and he hurried to the office near by.
The clerk permitted him to look over the
list, l?irEt he ran through the first-class
passengers, and was surprised to find
that there was no such name as . Gug
genslocker in the list. Then he went over
the second .class, but still no Guggen
tlockcr. ' I
G. B. McCUTCHEON
"Hasn't Mr. Gusreenslocker taken pas
sage?' he demanded, unwilling to be
lieve his eye?.
"Not on the Kaiser Wilhelm, sir."
Then, by George, they'll miss the
boat: " Lorry exclaimed. "Maybe they'll
be here in a few minutes."
"They cant get anything but steerage
now, sir. Everything else is gone."
"Are you sure they haven't taken pas
sage?" asked the bewildered Lorry,
weakly.
"You can see for yourself," answered
the young man curtly.
Lorry was again in a perspiration, this
time the result of a vague, growing suspi
cion that had forced itself into his mind.
He wandered aimlessly away, his brain a
chaos of speculation. The suspicion to
which ho had given countenance grew.
and as it enlarged he suffered torment
untold. Gradually he came to the conclu
sion that she had fooled him, had lied to
him. She did not intend to sail on the
"W^lnelm at all. Jt was all very clear to
h'm now. that strangeness in her manner,
those odd (H-oisional smiles. What was
she? An adventuress! That sweet-faced
pirl a little ordinary coquette, a liar? He
turned cold with the thought. Nor was
she alone in her duplicity. Had not her
uncle and aunt been as ready to deceive
him? Were they trying to throw him off
theii track for some subtle purpose? Had
they done something for which they were
i ompelled to fly the country as Quickly
a.s possible? No! Not that! They cer
tainly were not fleeing from justice. But
why wen they not on board the Kaiser
Wiihelm?
Suddenly he started as if he had been
struck, and an Involuntary exclamation
of pain and horror escaped his lips. Per
haps something unforeseen had happened
âan accidentâ illnessâ eveiv death!
The clanging of bells broke upon his
ears and he knew that the great ship was
abcut to depart. Mechanically, disconso
lately he walked out and paced the broad,
crowded wharf. Ah was excitement.
There was the rush of people, the shouts,
the cheers, the puffing of tugs, the churn
ing of water, and the Kaiser Wilhelm wa.s
off on its long voyage. Half-heartedly,
miserably and in a dazed condition h<^
found a place in the front row along the
rail. There were tears in his eyes, tears
of anger, shame and mortification. She
had played with him!
Moodily he watched the crowd of voy-
Rgers hanging over the rails of the mov
ing leviathan of the deey>. A [atat smile
of irony came to his lips. This was thy
boat on which his heart was to have been
freighted from native shores. The craft
was sailing, but it was not carrying the
cargo that he had, in very good faith,
consigned to Graustark. His heart was
certainly not on board the Kaiser Wil
helm der Grosse.
Gloomily his disappointed eyes swept
along the rail of the big steamer, ha.:'
interested in spite of themselves. Twice
they passed a certain point on -the Tor
ward deck, unconscious of a force that
was attracting them in that direction.
The third time he allowed them to Beetle
for an instant on the group of faces a.i-i
figures and then stray off to other parts
of the ship. Some strange power drew
them again to the forward deck, and tbir>
time he was startled into an intent start.
Could he believe those eyes? Surely -li'it
was her figure at the railâ there bet we. -i
the two young women who were waving
their handkerchiefs so frantically. Hw
heart began to jump up and down, wildly,
doubtingly. impatiently. Why could no 1
that face be turned toward the wharf bs
the others were? There was the Ml**
coat but not the blue cap. A jaunty sailor
hat sat where the never-to-be-forgotten
cap had perched. The change was Blight.
but it was sufficient to throw him Into
the most feverish state of uncertainty.
An insane desire to shout a command to
this strange young woman came over
him.
The ship was slowly opening a gap be
tween herself and the wharf, and he
knew that in a few moments recognition
would be impossible. Just as he was los
ing hope and was ready to. groan with de
spair the 'ace beneath the sailor hat was
turned squarely in his direction. A glaze
obscured his eyes, a numbness attacked
his brain. It was Miss Guggenslocker!
Why was her name omitted from the
passenger list? That question was xhe
first to whirl through his addled brain.
He forgot the questionings, forgot every
thing a moment later, for to his amaze
ment and delight and discomfiture he
saw that she was peering intently at him.
A pair of big glasses was leveled at him
for a second and then lowered. He plain
ly saw the smile on her face, and the
fluttering cambric in her hand. She had
seen him. after all â had caught him in
a silly exhibition of weakness. Her laÂ«t
impression of him, then, was to be one
of which he could not feel proud. While
his heart burned with shame, it could not
have been suspected from the appearance
of his face. His eyes were dancing, his
mouth was wide open with joy, his lips
were quivering with a suppressed, shout,
his cheeks were flushed and his whole
aspect bespoke ecstacy. He waved l> : s
hat and then his handkerchief, obtaining
from her vigorous and unrestrained signs
of approbation. Her face was wreathed
in smiles as she leaned far over the rail,
the picture of animated pleasure.
Making sure that her uncle and aunt
were not visible, he boldly placed his fin
gers to his lips and wafted a kiss out
over the water!
"Now she'll crush me," he cried to him
self, regretting the rash act and pray
ing that she had not observed it.
Her handkerchief ceaeed fluttering in an
instant, and, with sinking heart, he real
ized that she had observed. There was a
moment of indecision on the part of the
fair one going out to sea. and then the
little finger tips of both hands went to
her lips and his kiss came back to him!
The people near him were surprised to
hear a wild yell from his lips and then to
see him wave his hat so madly that there
was some danger of its being knocked
to Dieces against the railing or upon the
persons of those who stood too close to
escape the whirling consequences. So un
expected had been her reception of what
he considered a calamitous indiscretion
that he was to be pardoned for the ebul
lition of relief and joy that followed. Had
she drawn a revolver and fired angrily
at him he could not have been more as
tounded. But. to actually throw a kiss
to himâ to meet his imprudence in the
same spirit that had inspired it! Too
much to believe! In the midst of his
elation, however, there came a reminder
that she did not expect to see him agin,
that she was playing with him. that it
was a merry jest and not a heartache that
filled her bosom at the parting.
While he was still waving his handker
chief, debating savagely and joyously the
wisdom of the act, she became a part of
the distant color scheme; the blue figure
faded and blended into the general tone
and could no longer be distinguished. She
was gone, but she had tossed him a kiss
from lips that he should always see. As
he turned away from the water he found
himself wondering if there had been
tears in her eyes, but the probability was
so remote that he laughed foolishly and
aloud. A couple of girls heard the laugh
and giggled in sympathy, but he turned a
scowling face upon them and disappeared
in the throng.
Uppermost in his bewildered mind was
the question: Why Is she not in the pas
senger list? Acting on a sudden impulse,
he again sought out the clerk in charge
and made a most thorough inspection.
TWie was no O-uggens!ocker among the
name?. As a last resort he asked:
"They could not have sailed under an
assumed name, could they?"
"I can't say as to that. Where are they
going?"
"Graustark."
But the young man shook his head
slowly. Lorry's shaking in unconscious
accord.
"Are you sure that you saw the young
lady on board?"
"Well, rather!" exclaimed Lorry, em
phatically.
"I was going to say there are a lot of
Italian and German lingers on the ship,
and you might have been mistaken. But
since you are so positive, it seems very
strange that your friends are not on the
list."
So Lorry went away discouraged and
with a vague fear that she might have
been a prima donna whose real name
was (Juggenslccker. but whooe stage
name was something more euphonious.
He instantly put away the thought and
the fear. She was certainly not an op
era singer.â impossible! He diove back
to his hotel, and made preparations for
his return to Washington. Glancing cas
ually over the register he came to the
name that had been haunting himâGug
genslocker! There were the names, "Cas
par Guggenslocker and four. Graustark."
Without hesitation he began to question
the clerk.
"They sailed en the Kaiser Wilhelm to
day, " said that worthy. "That's all I
know about them. They came yesterday
and left to-day."
Mr. Grenfall Lorry returned to Wash
ington as in a dream â a fairy dream. The
air of mystery that had grown from the
first was now an impenetrable wall, the
top of which his curiosity could not scale.
Even his fancy, his imagination, served
him not. There was but one point on
which he was satisfied: he was in love.
His own condition was no mystery.
Several weeks later he went to New
York to question the captain of the Wil
helm, hoping vo clear away the clouds
satisfactorily. To his amazement the cap
tain said there had been no Guggenslock
ers on board nor had there been persons
answering the description, so far as he
could tell.
Through tha long hot summer he
worked and worried and wondered. In
the first, he did little that was satisfac
tory to himself or to his uncle; in the
second, he did so much that he was ad
vised by his physician to take a rest; in
the last, he indulged hiin'self so exten
sively that it had become unbearable. He
must know all about her! But how?
The early months of autumn found him
pale and tired and indifferent alike to
work and play. He found no pleasure in
society that had known him as a lion.
Women bored him; men annoyed him; the
play suffocated him; the tiresome club
was ruining his temper; the whole world
was going wrong. The doctor told him
he was approaching nervous prostration;
his mother's anxious eyes could no longer
he denied, so he realized grimly that
there was but one course left open to
him. He suggested it to the doctor, to
his mother and to his uncle, and they
agreed with him. It involved Europe.
Having fully decided again to cross the
sea his spirits revived. He became more
cheerful, took an Interest In things that
were going on and by the time the Kaiser
Wilhelm sailed in September was the pic
ture of health and life.
He was off for Edelweissâ to the strange
Miss Guggenslocker who had thrown him
a kiss from the deck that sailing day.
VI-GRAUSTARK.
Two weeks later Grenfall Lorry was
landed and enjoying the sensations, the
delights of that wonderful world called
by the name of Paris. The second day
after his arrival he met a Harvard man
of his time on the street. Harry Anguish
THE SUNDAY CALL.
had been a pseudo art student for two
years. When at college he was a hail
fellow-well-met, a leader in athletics and
in matters upon which faculties frown.
He and Lorry were warm friends, al
though utterly unlike in temperament.
To know either of these men was to like
him; between the two one found all that
was admirable and interesting in man. .
The faults and virtues of each were along
such different lines that they balanced
perfectly when lumped upon the scale of
personal estimation. Their unexpected
meeting in Paris was an exhilarating
pleasure to both, and for the next week
or so they were inseparable. Together
they sipped absinthe- at the cafes and
strolled into the theaters, the opera, the
dance halls and the homes of some of
Anguish's friends, French and American.
Lorry did not speak to his friend of
Graustark until nearly two weeks after
his arrival in the city. He had discussed
with himself the advisability of revealing
his plans to Anguish, fearing the latter's
ridicule with all the cowardice of a man
who knows that scoffing is, in a large
measure, justifiable. Growing impatient
to begin the search for the unheard of
country, its capital and at least one of its
inhabitants, he was at last compelled to
inform Anguish, to a certain extent, of his
plans for the fueurc. He began by telling
him of his intention to take a run over
toward Vienna, Buda Pesth and some of
the Eastern cities, expecting to be gone a
couple of months. To his surprise and
conbternation, Anguish enthusiastically
volunteered to take the trip with him,
having had the same project in view lor
nearly a yeafr.
There was nothing left for Lorry but to
make a clean breast of it. which he did
shamefacedly, expecting the laughter and
raillery of his light hearted friend as pay
ment tor his cOnnuence. instead, however,
Anguish, who possessed a lively and"
romantic nature, was charmed by the
story and proclaimed it to be. the most
delightful adventure that had ever hap
pened outside of a story book.
"Tell me all about her," he urged, his
eyes sparkling with boyish enthusiasm.
And Lorry proceeded to give him a per
sonal description of the mysterious
beauty, Introducing him in the same man
ner to the distinguished uncle and aunt,
adding all those details which had con
founded and upset him during his own
investigations.
"This is rich!" exclaimed Anguish.
"Beats any novel written, I declare. Be
gad, old man, I don't blame you for hunt
ing down this wonderful bit of femininity.
With a curiosity and an admiration that
had been sharpened so keenly as yours,
I'd go to the endÂ§>f the world myself to
have them satisfied."
"I may be able to satisfy but oneâcuri
osity. And maybe not that. But who
knows of Graustark?"
"Don't give up before you've tried. If
these people live in such a place, why, it
is to be found, of course. Any railroad
guide book can locate this land ol
mystery. There are so many infernal little
kingdoms and principalities over here that
it would take a lifetime to get 'em all
straightened out in one's head. To-mor
row morning we will go to one of the big
railway stations and make inquiries. We'll
locate Graustark and then well go over
and pluck the flower that grows there.
All you need, my boy, is a manager. I'll
do the arranging and your little act will
be the plucking."
"Easier said than done."
"She threw a kiss to you, didn't ahe?"
"Certainly, but, confound it, that was
because she never expected to see me
again."
"Same reason why you threw a kiss to
her, I suppose?"
"I 'know why; I wasn't accountable."
"Well, if she did it any more wittingly
than you did, she is accountable, and I'd
hunt her up and demand an explanation."
Lorry laughed at his apparent fervor,
but Was glad that he had connded in his

energetic countryman. Two heads we^e
better than one, and he was forced to
admit to himself that he rather liked the
idea of company, in the undertaking. Not
that he expected to , encounter any par
ticular difficulty, but that he" saw a
strange ' loneliness , a+iead. Therefore he
welcomed .his friend's avowed intention to
accompany him to Edelweiss" as a relief
instead of an. annoyance. Until, late in
the night they discussed; the coming trip.
Anguish finally startling him with a ques
tion, just as. he was stretchings himself
preparatory to the walk to his Hotel: >-'
"What are you going 1 ' to do with her
after you find her, Gren; old man?" .
Grerifall's brow puckered and he brought
himself up with a jerk, puzzled uncer
tainty* expressing itself in his posture as
well as in his face. - . '.
"I'll think about; that after I have
found her," he replied.
"Think you'll marry her?" persisted the
other.
"How do I know?" exclaimed the wo
man hunter, savagely.
"Oh, of course you don't knowâ
could you?" apologized Anguish. "Maybe'
she won't have youâ maybe she is mar
riedâ sorts of contingencies, you know.
But, if you'll pardon my inquisitivenesa,
1 Â«- like to ask why. you are making this
wild goose chase half around the world?
Just to have another look at her?"
"You asked me if I thought â -" Here
he stopped.
"I take It for granted, then, that you'd
like to. Well. I'm glad that I've got
something definite on which to base oper
ations. The one object of our endeavors,
from now on, is to exchange Guggens
locker for Lorryâ certainly no robbery. A
charity, I should say. Good night.'" See
you in the morning."
The next morning the two friends took
a cab to several railway stations and in
quired about Graustark and Edelweiss.
"She was stringing you, old man," said
Anguish, after they had turned away
from the . third station. He spoke com
miseratingly, as he really felt sorry.
"No!" exclaimed Lorry. ' "She told me
the truth. There is a Graustark and she
lives there. I'll stake- my life on those
eyed of hers." !
"Are you sure she said it was in Eu
rope?" asked Harry, looking up and down
the street as fi he would not have beÂ«n
surprised to see her in Peris, j In his heart
he believed that she and her precious rela
tives had deceived old Gren. Perhaps
their home was in Paris, and nowhere
else. But for Lorry's positiveness he
would have laughed heartily at the other's
simple credulity or branded him a dolt,
the victim of some merry actress' whim!
Still, he was forced to admit, he was not
in a position to see matters as they ap
peared and was charitable enough to
bide his time and to humor the faith that
was leading them from place to place in
the effort to find a land that they knew
nothing; about. Lorry seemed so sure, so
positive, that he was loath to see his
dream dispelled, his ideal shattered. There
was certainly no Graustark; neither had
the Guggenslockers sailed on the Wil
helm, all apparent evidence to the con
trary notwithstanding. Lorry had been
in a delirium _ and had imagined he saw
her on the ship. If there, why was not
her name In the list? But that problem
tortured the sanguine searcher himself.
At last, in . despair, after a fruitless
search of two days, Lorry was willing to
submit. With the perverseness common
to half-defeated fighters, Anguish at once
protested, forgetting that he had sought
to dissuade his friend the day before.
"We'll go to the library of Paris and
take a look through the books and maps,"
he said. "Or. better still, let us go to
the postofflce. There! Why have we not
thought of that? What there is of Grau
stark they'll know in the postal service."
Together they ' visited the chief post
office, where, after being directed to vari
ous deputies and clerks, they .' at length
found the department in which the infor
mation -was , obtainable. Inside of five
minutes they were in possession of facts
that vindicated Miss Guggenslocker, lifted
Lorry to the seventh heaven, and put Mr.
Anguish into an agony of impatience.
Graustark was a small principality away
off to the east and Edelweiss was a city
of i some seventy-five thousand \ â¢ inhabit
ants, according to the postal guidebook.
The Americans could learn no more
there, so they went, to Baedecker's office.
Here they found a great map, and, after a
diligent and almost ' microscopic search,
succeeded in : discovering ; the ; principality
of Graustark. Then they looked at each

ing his nose reflectively. "What an out
landish place for a girl like her to live
In." he continued. "And that sweet-faced
old lady and noble Uncle Caspar! i c
-gods! one would think barbarians existed
there and not such people as the Gug
genslockers, refined, cultivated, smart,
rich. I'm more interested than ever in the
place."
"So am I! I'm willing and ready to
make the trip, old man, if you are still
of a mind. It's a lark. and. besides she
may not be the only pretty and gracious
girl there. We've had hard work to hnd
it on the map. let's not stop till we see
Edelweiss on the earth its If."
They made hasty preparations for the
journey. Anguish, romantic ami ruil uJ
adventure, advised the purchase of a pair
of pistols and a knife apiece, maintaining
that, as they were gates into an unknown
and mountainous region, they- should be
prepared for brigands and other elements
of danger. Lorry pooh-poohed the sug
gestion of brigands, but indulged his
moo.l by buying some ugly-looking re
volvers and inviting the prospect of
something really thrilling in the v.ay of
adventure. With their trans they were
soon whirling through France, bound for
a certain great city, on the road to Edel
weiss, one filled with excitement, eager
ness and boyish zeal, the other haras?**]
by the somber fear that a grave disap
pointment was in store tor him. Through
the glamour and the picturesqueness cf
the adventure there always crept the un
conquerable "feeling that he was on a
fool's errand, that He was committing a
deed so weak and brainless that 11 was
sure to make him a veritable laushins
stock when it became known. After all.
who was Miss Guggenslockerâ brewer,
baker, gardener or sar.oage-maker?
Traveling, . of course, wa.? pleasant at
this time of the year, and the two Amer
icans saw much that interested them
along the way.
Their French, especially Anguish's, was
of great value to theÂ», for they found
occasion to use it at all times and in all
places. Both spoke German fairly well
and took every opportunity to_prush up
in that language. Lorry remembering that
the Guggenslpckers used many expres
sions, that showed a preference for the
Teutonic. The blithe Anguish, confident
and in high feather, was heart and soul
in the odd expedition of love, and talked
incessantly of their reception by the far
away hostess, their impressions and the
final result. His camera and sketching
materials were packed away with his
traps.: It was his avowed, intention to im
mortalize the trip by means of plate, pal
ette and brush. â¢ .%'-':
At the end of two days they reached a
certain large city, the first change, and
then 700 miles to another. The distance
from this point to the capital of Graus
tark was 200 miles or more, chiefly
through mountainous lands. Somewhat
elated by the cheerful information there
received, they resumed the journey to Ed
elweiss, the city of vale, slope and park
âsummer, fall and winter. Changing cars
at the end of the second day out. they sat
back in the dusty seats of their carriage
and sighed with relief.
"Unless we jump the track, this train
will land us in the city we are looking
for." said Anguish, stretching out his legs
comfortably. "I'll admit It has been a
tiresome journey, and I'll be glad when
we can step into a decent hotel, have a
rub and ; feel like white men once more.
"Tl am , beginning; to feel like these dirty
Slavs and, Huns we saw way back there."
*i "There's one thing certain," said Lorry,
looking out -of the window. "The people
and the habitations are different and the .
whole world seems changed since we left
that station. Look at those fellows on
' horseback over there."
. "What did I tell you about brigands and
robbers!" "exclaimed Anguish. "If those
fellows are not bandits I'll lose faith in
every novel I ever read."
The train rolled slowly past three
mounted^ men whose steeds stood like
statues upon a little knoll to the right of
the track, men and beasts engaged in si
lent contemplation of the cars. The men,
picturesquely attired and looking fierce. â¢
" carrying long rifles, certainly bore an as
pect that suggested the brigand. When
the guard entered the carriage Anguish
asked in German for some information
concerning the riders.
"Dey're frontier police guards." re
sponded the man in English, smiling at
their astonishment. Both Americans
arose and shook hands with him.
"By George, it's good to hear a man
talk white mans language," cried An
guish.
"How do you come to be holding a job
on this road? An Englishman?" demand
ed Lorry. He looked anything but Eng
lish.
"I'm not an Englishman." Â¦ said the
guard, flushing 3lightly. "My name's
Sitzky, and I'm an American, sir."
"An American!" exclaimed Lorry. Sitz
ky grew loquacious. .; [Â¦';['. \
"Sure! I used to be a sailor on a United
States man-o'-war. A couple of years ago
I got into trouble down at Constantinople
and had to get out of de service. After
dat I drifted up dis way and went to rail
rcadin'." He hadn't exactly the manner
of a man-o'-warsman.
"How long have you been on this road?"
asked Grenfall. . . _
"'Bout a year, I should t'ink. Been on
. dis branch only two months, dough."
"Are you pretty well acquainted in Ed
elweiss?" . n^v.K
"Oh, I run in dere every other dayâ ln
an' out agin. It's a fine purtiest
you ever saw in your life. The town runs
right up the mountain to tha tip-top
where the monks â clear .up in d*
clouds. Dey say it snows up dere almost
all d' time." '
. Later on, from \ the loquacious guard,
the two Americana learned quite a good
bit about the country and city to which
they were going. His knowledge was
somewhat limited along certain lines, but
quite clear as to others.
"Dis Graustark, 's fer as I know, is
eder a sort o' state or somet'ingj belong
in' to de umpire, governed by Its own rul
ers. Edelweiss is d' capital; d' big guns
of d' land lives dere. j I've walked out and

German. Dey've got a little standin'
army of two or free t'ousand men an"

up north of Graustark, and dey got In a
wrangle 'bout somethin'. and dey tell me
in Edelweiss dat for .'bout a year dcv
fought like Sam Patch." y
â¢Which was victorious?" demanded
Lorry, deeply interested.
"I'm not sure. To hear d' Edelweis
people talk you'd t'ink dey licked d' day
lights out of d' other slobs, but somehow
I got next to d' fact dat dem other fel
lows captured de city an* went after a
slashin' big war indemnity. I don't know
much 'bout it, an' maybe I'm clear off
but I fink d' Graustark army was
trashed. Every f ing is prosperous now
dough, an' you'd never know dered been
a war. It's de most peaceable town I
ever saw."
"Did you ever hear of the Guggen
slockers?" asked the irrepressible An
guish, and Lorry felt like kicking him.
"In Edelweiss? Never did. Friends o*
yours?"
'â¢Acquaintances." interposed Lorry,
hastily, frowning at Anguish.
"You won't have any trouble flndin"
'em it dere anybody at all." said Sitzky,
easily. D' hotel people ought to be able
to tell you all 'bout 'cm." .
"By the way, what is the best hotel
there?" asked Anguish.
"Dere's d' Burnowentz, one block north
of d' depot. ' The travelers locked at
one another and smiled. Sitzky^observing
the action. "Oh," he said, pleasantly,
"dere's a swell joint uptown called d'
Kegengetz. It's too steep fer me, but
maybe you gents can stand it. If you
hang around <i' depot fer a little while
after we get in I'll steer you up dere."
"Well make it worth your while,
Sitzky," said Lcrry.
" "Never mind dat, now. Americans
ought to stick together, no matter where
dey are. We'll have a drink an' 'at' 3
all. just to show we're fellow country
men."
"We'll have several drinks, and well
ea and drink to-night at the; 'swell joint'
you talk about," said Anguish.
â¢We may drink dere, but I'll not eat
dere. Dey wouldn't let a railroad guard
inside de feedto' pen. Why. nothin' but
royal guys eat tlere when dey're down
town ppin' or exposin' demselves to
public gaze."
True to his word when they reached
Edelweiss late that afternoon Sitzky.
their fri%nd of uncertain origin, hurriedly
finished up his work and joined the
travelers iii the station. Lorry and An
guish were deeply interested in all they
-a-.v, the strange people, the queer build
ings, the odd costumes and the ate -of
antiquity that prevailed. Once upon the
narrow. "clean street they saw that Edel
weiss was truly a city Â»i the mountain
side They had expected something
wonderful, but were not prepared for
what they found. The city actually ran
up into the clouds. There was something
so grand, so improbable, so unusual in
the spectacle confronting them that they
stared like children, aghast and stupefied.
Each had the startling impression that
a great human-dotted mountain was fall
ing over noon his head; it was impossible
to subdue "the sensation of dizziness that
the toppling town inspired. c if , tv
â¢I know how you feel," observed Sitzk> .
laughing. "I was just d' same at first.
To-morrow you walk a little ways up d
side of d* mountain an* you'll see how
much of d' city dere is on level ground
down here. Dem buildings up dere am t
more'n one-fiftieth part of d' town. Dey re _
mostly summer homes. It gets not^rs
blazes down here in d' valley in d middle
of d' summer and d' rich ones *fit>ve up
d' mountain."
"How in thunder do people get up to
and down from those houses r* demanded
Anguish. "*- * ,_"
"Mules," answered Sitzky. specifically.
"Say! See dat little old feller comin* on
horsebackâ wid d' white uniform? Well,
dats de Chief of Police, an' d" fellers
behind him are police guards. 'At'a old
Dangloss himself. He's a peach, dey say."
A short, grizzly faced man, attired in a
white uniform with red trimmings, fol
lowed by three men similarly garbed, rode
by, going in the direction of the passenger
station. Dangloss. as Sitzky- had called
him. was quite small in stature, rather
stout, gray bearded and eagle nosed. His
face was keen and red, and not at all the
kind to invite familiarity. As he passed
them the railroad guard of America^^
citizenship touched his cap, the twu
travelers doing likewise, whereupon the
Chief of Police gave them a most pro
found salutation, fairly sweeping his
saddleskirts with his white cap.
"Polite old codger," observed Anguish.
"His company manners. Just let him
get you in d' sweat box, if you fink he's
polite." been there?" f '
"Ever been there?"
"Well." a little confusedly, "I pasted a
Graustark baggage master down in d*
yards two weeks ago, an' dey had me up.
I proved d' feller insulted a lady, an'
old Dangloss let me off, sayin' I'd ought
to have a medal. Dese guys are great
lon gallantry when ladies is concerned.
If it hadn't been fer dat. I'd be
in d' lock-up now. An' say, you ought to
see d' lock-up! It's a tower, wid dungeons
an' all dat sort of f ing. A man couldn't
no more get out 'n' he could fly up to d'
monastery. Dey're great on law an' order
here, too. D' Princess has Issued strictest
kind of rules an' everybody has to live up
to 'em as If dey was real gospel. I
fought I'd put you next, gents, so's you
wouldn't be doin' anyfing crooked here."
"Thanks," said Lorry, dryly. "We shall
try to conduct ourselves discreetly In thÂ«
city."
Probably a quarter mile farther down
the narrow, level street they came to tha
bazaars, the gaudy stores, and then the
hotel. It was truly a hostelry to inspire
respect and admiration in the mind of
such as Sitzky. for it was huge and well
equipped with the modern appointments.
As soon as the two Americans had been
given their rooms they sent for their
luggage. Then they went out to the broad
piazza, with its columns and marble
balustrades, and looked for Sitzky, re
membering their invitation to drink. The
guard had refused to enter the hotel with
them, urging them to allow him to. re
main on the piazza. He was not there
when thsy returned, but they soon saw
him. On the sidewalk he was arguing 1
with a white uniformed police guard, and
they realized that he had been ejected
from sacred precincts.
They promptly rescued him from the
officer, who bowed and strode away as
soon as they interceded.
; "Dese fellers is slick enough to see you.
are swells and I'm not," said Sitzky. not
a bit annoyed by his encounter. "I'll bet
my head 'at inside ten minutes old Dan
gloss will know who you are, where you
come from, an' what you're doin* here."
"I'll bet fifty heads he won't find out
t what we're doing here," grinned Anguish,
looking at Lorry. "Well, let's hunt up the
thirst derjartment." .
They found the little apartment in
which drinks were served at tables, and
before they said good-by to Sitzky in
front of the hotel, a half hour later, that
worthy was in exceeding good humor and
very much flushed in the face. He said
he would be back in two days, and if
they needed him for any purpose what
ever, they could reach him by a note at
the railway station.
"Funny how you run across- an Ameri
can in every nook and corner of the
world," mused Lorry, as they watched
the stocky ex-man-o'-warsman stroll off
toward his hotel.
"It we can run across the Guggenslock
ers as easily we'll be n luck. When shall
we begin the hunt? To-night?"
"We can make a few inquiries concern
ing them. They certainly are people of
importance here."
i "I don't see the name on any of the
brewery signs around town," observed
Anguish, consolingly. "There's evidently
no Guggenslocker here."
They strolled through the streets near
the hotel until after 6 o'clock, wondering
at the quaint architecture, the pretty
gardens and the pastoral atmosphere that
enveloped the city. Everybody was busy,
contented, quiet and happy. There was
no bustle or strife, no rush, no beggar 3.
At 6 they saw hundreds of workir
on the streets going to their homes:
shops were closed and there came tc^*
their ears the distant boom of cannon
evidently fired from different points of
. the compass, and from the highland as
well as the lowland. ,

IS it a paying investment to bring up
one's daughter for society?
I asked Mrs. John I. Sabin. She is
the mother of three popular society
girls and she certainly ought to
know. . *
"A paying investment," repeated Mrs.
Sabinf "I hardly understand what you
mean."
â¢Why." raid I, "for instance, when you
have expended so many hundreds or
thousands as may be upon all kinds of
tutors, dancing and riding masters, mu
sic teachers, carriages an.i gowns, will
you feel that you have been amply re
paid for the money, trouble and time ex
} ended?"
For answer she laughed and she laugh
ed mirthfully. There was none of that
feel-obliged-to giggle. She was frankly
amused.
And then she sat down in her delight
ful drawing-room and laughed some
more. "Why, what a queer idea," she
exclaimed. "French and German tutors
and all the rest of a girl's education being
considered as a means of entering society.
Why. it Is all perfect nonsense. These
things are not taken up with that idea
at all."
"But." I argued, "a society girl has to
be taught certain things to be a society
girl or rather to be a successful one."
"Certainly," said Mrs. Sabin.
And I felt that I had gained one point.
"Do you agree that there is a special
course of training for a debutanteâ that
the training is as hard and as fast as
that for trained nurses or for teachers?"
â¢'Yes and no." she answered. "I believe
heartily in private schools. That Is. if
one can afford It. They meet girls there
who are frequently life-long friends. Mind
you, I am not Eaying ..that the public
schools are not good and that charming
girls do not attend them, but I am merely
answering your question.
"All of my girls have attended a board
ing school. Even that has changed to a
certain extent. They used to be taught
how to enter and how to leave a room
gracefully, but their outside sport and
gymnastic training have made all that un
necessary. It is impossible for any girl
these days to be positively awkward."
I thought that over and I accepted it
with a grain of salt. But perhaps she
was right. Probably those in my mind
were not society girls.
"A girl who has had a good, broad edu
cation, a fair musical training and has a
level head will rarely make a mistake,"
she went on. "There is a something that
does not have to be taught, a something
that cannot be bought. It is acquired un
consciously. A girl who is simple and un
affected is what pleases me most, and I
b< lieve she Is the favorite everywhere.
"It is invaluable to know how to an
swer what some one meant but didn't sa_y,
and to know how to dress well and in
taste. And tact. Did any one ever get
along without tact?"
1 ruefully acknowledged that they didn't
ascend very far into the heavens, and I
lamented that there was another thing
that could not be purchased. I wonder
how many barrels would be sold a min
ute?
"What do girls need most, In your opin
ion?" I asked.
"Bringing: out," was the prompt re
joinder. "The American girls are clever
at imitating and they never let anything
escape them. If they are unable to bo
original, they can copy welL
"Most of our girls have decided ideas
of their own. Listen to a number of girls
talking and see how they will argue and
argue. They need to know how to re
frain from saying. 'Oh, I don't think
so!' when they really do think it em
phatically. To listen well is a great ac
complishment, and one that few women
have fully mastered."
"How much does it cost to successfully
launch a girl?" I queried.
"I haven't the faintest idea what It
â¢xould be. Cut to please you, I'll think."
While she did rapid mathematics. I
leaned Lack in a comfortable gilt -chair
and mused quietly to myself. The draw
ing-rooms wer<? of the most harmonious
green, the reception room Just off was
slightly on the Turkish, and altogether it
made such a rcstt'-jl picture. Would it
be possible for a girl to care r.aupht
for her surroundings? Certainly nor home
must influence her more than
"I have maae a ro->rrh estimate," said
Mrs. Sabin, and I < ame back from my
hazy dreams. "This is what I think would
be necessary, but 1 do not know how it
would compare with anybody else's flg
uree.
"It goes without saying: that all girls
take music of , some kind. When they
are email it is instrumental, and that
.costs not less than two and a half a les
son. When they are larger, vocal is add
ed. With two lessons a week, that alone
amounts to about twenty-five dollars. I
should say that a thousand dollars would
not be too great an estimate for music.
"All girls those days drive or ride. My
girls do not ride to any extent, because
I a..Â« monauy arraia or re. . But tney
have their trap both here and in our
country home. The cost of learning to
handle the ribbons is not to be consid
ered. Usually some one in the family
knows enough about it to teach them all
that is necessary. It is more practice
than anything else. But the ponies and
all that is connected With them cost in
the neighborhood of five hundred dollars.
"And clothes," she added. : -..'\
"And clothes," I echoed. Lives there
a girl -with soul so '. dead that clothes do
not interest her, particularly the cost?
"Clothes, one would ; think, ar^lnot an
important item un>ll one's daughter

THE SUNDAY CALL.
portant^. 'mere is never a time wnen trier
aro not of the utmost consequence. From
the time a baby is old enough to notice
her gown and to look in the glass they are
of intense importance.
"The girl who grows up without the
least regard for her clothes seldom can
be taught to think of them seriously. She
must be educated to dress herself well
just as she is trained to use careful Eng
lish. Fortunately mothers have little dif
ficulty in that line. But when such a
thing does occur It is little Bhort of a
calamity.
"Of course, she eventually falls in love
with some man, and thai is the greatest
cure that 1 know of; but it may be too
late, not one gin out or ten tninKs nait
as much about her clothes and her appear
ance as when she is striving to look well
in somebody else's eyes.
"But understand me, I do not think
that any girl should be made to think of
her apparel and pay no attention to other
things. The simplest frocks are the pret
tiest, but by no means the least expen
sive.
"How much ought they to cost, you
ask? Well, let us see. The opera season
is coming on and that means clothes. An
evening gown costs anywhere from six
ty-five to a hundred. The plainest fab
rics must be silk-lined and the findings
count up In a hurry. An opera cloak
costs about $105 or $110; not any less. And
then there are silk stockings, slippers
and petticoats to go with each gown,
to say nothing of fans and the numerous
little acquisitions that go with such an
outfit.
"Each toilet calls for a certain lay-out.
If it is not complete, the entire effect is
lost, and no mother wants her daughter,
to appear In public and not have all in
keeping. I know I wouldn't.
"Naturally her clothes are the greatest
expense. I would not want to try to
dress my girls on a cent less than $3000
a year. Even then I think the marsrin
rould be rather low. Mind you, that
includes all of her clothing. There ara
afternoon frocks, tea gowns, tailor suits,
ninner dresses, to say nothing about ball
gowns. But after all, the cost depends
mainly upon the girl."
About that time I commenced to flgura
on the side. I was afraid if I waited too
lons the numbers would get entirely too
big for me to ever hope to catch up.
Roughly it came to $4500. And there are
a host of other indispensables.
"And do you think she must be taught
how to entertain?" I asked, "or does It
.'list come naturally."
She looked thoughtful a minute.
"That again depends upon the girl. You
know yourself that some people seem to
know exactly how and when to do things
and that others are always making blun
ders of some sort. It is a good policy
to have your daughter present in the
drawing-room at afternoon tea. She be
comes used to It and nothing raffles her.
"Again, she must have her little lunch
eons and her dinners.- Quite informal, you
know, until she has made her debut, but
the details must be perfect nevertheless.
Then there are small githerings, inex
pensive in themselves, but at the end of
a year they all count up. A simple five
course dinner is bound to cost about
twenty dollars, and during the winter
there are somewhere in the neighborhood
of twelve or fifteen. And then the 'coming
out' tea. With no decorations to speak of
and with no attempt at display, the ca
terer's bHI will be between four hundred
and fifty and five hundred dollars.
"I do not think that fifteen hundred
would be any too much. There might ba
a little margin, but I havo found out that.
bs a rule, the other side needs assistance.
Yea, I think fifteen hundred would bÂ«
about right."
"By the way. Mrs. Sabin. have you ever
heard of a conversation tutor?" I asked.
â¢Aâ?" she asked frankly.
"Why, yes," 1 answered glibly; "a con
versation tutor. One who teaches charm
ing manners, who suggests good words
and phrases, strengthens French and pol
ishes off the rough places, as it were."
I had never heard of such a tutor until
recently; for they are an Eastern product
and have not taken root in our 3oil as yet.
"No," she answered, "I have never
heard of them, and I spend six months of
the year In the East. Anyhow, I do not
consider them necessary. If a girl has no
humor I do not think it can be developed
by any amount of training. That is some
thing that is perfectly natural."
"Is there anything els<e that you can
think of that is necessary for a bud' 3 hap
piness and welfare?" I asked, busy with
my unruly figures again.
Six thousand and more to come. Good
heavens and all that money spent on one
girl and In one year.
"Books count up a little. A girl ought
to know what to read and what to re
member. But all that comes when she
has good books to choose from. The
young people of to-day enjoy reading, an-1
it is an instructive and innocent pastime.
"And the other is a trip to Europe. Two
would do no harm. Fifteen hun
dred dollars would about cover all
expenses, I should judge. Mind you,
I do not say that all these are nec
essary, and least of all. this trip. But
there ia no getting around it that travel
broadens and makes people see things
through other glasses. Again it gives
confidence. But really, much of this can
be disDensed with if the debutante has
beauty or personal magnetism. While
beauty is more than skin deep and helps
wonderfully, still if I were given my
choice, I should prefer magnetism. "
Again those figures of mine had been
creeping. They started out tiny, but how
rapidly they did grow. Just even $7500.
"My, it is horribly expensive," I mused
aloud.
"Yes," she answered smilingly, "it is."
"But to go back to the very beginning.
Does it all pay. anyhow," I insisted.
"That." pensively, "depends upon how
you look at it, and perhaps upon how
she marries. After all it is pretty much
of a lottery. But anything pays that gives
pleasure, I think. If after all this ex
pense, she fails to be what you were striv
ing after, more's the pity. But that is
rarely the case. Anyhow are wa ever
sure of anything?"

Wedding Fee News
THE parsons* fee Is one of the most
agitating questions the prospective
bridegroom has to deal with, and ha
Is oftentimes obliged to consult
some friend who has been through thÂ«
trying ordeal.
He knows, of course, that $2 Is all that
is required by law. but somehow he feels
It Is worth moreâ a case of sentiment ver
sus pocketbook.
If he could tell the parson his financial
standing, showing how really generous he
was. It would simplify matters consider
ably. This he cannot do, so he gives what
he can. trusting to the parson to under
stand that he would give more if he could
afford it.
While $2 Is what the '.aw allows, somÂ«
pÂ«ople pay a trifle moreâ l 3, J4 and $6; as
a rule they pay $5. which Is as much as
the average man can afford. Occasionally
$8 or $10 is given, while fees of $25 and
$s*) are very rare.
The total average of marriage fees of
the clergyman sum up about $800 a yearâ
a neat little sum. by the way.
Next to the bridegroom the clergyman's

HOW TO
START A
ZOO
AND KEEP
IT GOING
Y"f T'DGING from the number or large
I cities in our sister States that have
1 zoological gardens it is evident that
ft I if San Francisco wishes to come
*-*' in line she must look into the
natter.
New York is just about completing
what will be the greatest zoological park
In the world, the Bronx "Zoo." There
iÂ» already the foundation here for a good
collection in Golden Gate Park and at
tie Chutes and the necessary funds and
tie rest of the animals could be got by
Â¦various means and methods.
Perhaps the best way to get a zoo is
to decide whether the municipal funds or
a number of public-spirited men shall
pay for it, and then find out the amount
of money to be expended on the project.
That settled a good thine to do is to
write a letter to Carl Hagenbeck. the ani
mal purveyor of the world, stating what
is wanted. When he gets a letter of that
sort the city or individual writing gen
erally set a zoo.
He studies the climate, the topography
of the proposed park, finds out the sort
of collection wanted, etc. Then he makes
plans and if necessary sends men to any
country to build the houses, arrange the
park and place the animals. No one
knows better than he what a model zoo
loirical park should be.
From his world-famous park. ln Ham
burs:, Germany, he stocks and keeps sup
plied public and private animal collec
tions all the world over. Mr. Hagenbeck
inherited this unique business from his
father, who began his collection with six
seals. Now the son does the largest busi
ness of this kind in the world. Every
cay it grows more difficult to keep up
thÂ« supply of rare wild animals, the de
im.nd for which is increasing. Mr. Ha
genbeck keeps in his Hamburg park a
EurpluE of lions, tigers, bears and other
animals, very much as an ordinary stock
dealer, with the difference that these an
imals represent much adventure and peril
in securing them.
I.i case of the demand for animals be
coming unusually large they can be fur
nished from some of Hagenbecks depots
throughout the worldâ five in Asia, three
In 'Africa, several in Europe and one in
An-. erica. Men are traveling for him all
the time and everywhere, employing
thousands of natives in many countries
to aunt the forests and jungles for birds
tnc; beasts. These natives know: best
BOW to eaten me animals of theii- >wn
country unharmed. They bait lions.
tigers and panthers in cages and capture
them by means of strategy. Swift horses
and the la?so are the methods used for
captarfag other animals. When captured
only the best and physically sound among
them are accepted.
From the four corners of the earth an
imals arc constantly arriving for Mr. Ha
genbeck and as constantly being sent out
again. He now has on the way from
Russia four big lots of animals, includ
ing thirty camels, moose, ibexes, 25U
cranes from the south of Russia and al
most any other strange animal that can
be called for.
The heads of all Governments are al
ways ready to help this great animal
provider in every way possible and un
told numbers of natives are constantly
imperiling their lives In order that great
zoological collections may be found in
every corner of the world, or at least be
made possible.
The animal most in demand and which
is getting very scarce Is the rhinoceros.
There is now only one specimen in the
United States, and that is in Central
Park. Mr. Hagenbeck has succeeded in
producing two entirely new and unheard
of animalsâ one a cross between a lion
and a tiger, the other a cross between a
puma and an Italian leopard.
Another way to start a zoo Is to secure
contributions of animals or the money to
purchase them from citizens who have
private menageries or who feel an Inter
est in such exhibits. San Francisco has
many men able and willing to further
such a project, once interest in the sub
ject is fully aroused.
Some representative citizens of San
Francisco give their opinions on the mai
ler as follows:
DR. C. L LANE.
The time has not yet come when San
Francisco should have the "luxury" of a
zoological park. In the first place, the
money must be got together, and 1 do not
think we have reached that point where
we can afford it. Even when once estab
lished, a "zoo" is an exj>ensive thing to
maintain. When 1 was in Paris I noticed
DO WE WANT A FINE ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN? WE ALREADY HAVE THE NUCLEUS
FOR ONE AT GOLDEN GATE PARK. MANY OTHER GREAT CITIES HAVE WELL-ESTAB
LISHED AND ATTRACTIVE "ZOOS." OUR CLIMATE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD FOR IT.
WE HAVE THE MONEY, THE SPACE AND PROPER LOCAL CONDITIONS. DO WE WANT OWE?
READ WHAT A NUMBER OF OUR PROMINENT CITIZENS WHO GAVE THE MATTER CAREFUL
CONSIDERATION HAVE TO SAY AND THEN DECIDE FOR YOURSELF.
that the zoological garden in connection
with the Jardin dcs Plantes had been al
lowed to run down and deteriorate. When
that begins an institution of this sort loses
in a great measure its value. At Berlin
the animal collection or "Thiergarten" is
attached to the park there, one of the
finest, if not the finest, in the world. So
I think we could have no liner place for
a "zoo" than in the proper section of our
own beautiful park. Above all, it should
be in the bands of a well-posted man,
who is a constant student. The first thin^
to be done is to count up what such a
thing would cost, and 1 think there is
time enough yet for such a thing. For
the present I am a great believer in the
'further beautifying of the present pleas
ure park.
W. W. FOOTE.
One of the best zoos I have seen is the
one at Cincinnati. Ohio. Rich and travel
ed men of that city have taken an interest
in its development. One man purchased
and sent to this "zoo" some elephants
while another sent a giraffe. A fine lake
is a feature of this park. I have been
through the famous Kew Gardens in Lon
don and the Jardin dcs Plantes in Paris
and I think well arranged "zoos" are a
great means of educational Information
for students and others interested. If San
Francisco has one it should be in a cen
tral location and the more ground provid
ed for It the better. Still, some portion of
Golden Gate Park would probably be the
beet place for it. Men seem to be too busy
THE SUNDAY CALL.
here to take up such things, but the busi
ness men are the ones to start a "zoo"
going.
JAMES D. PHELAN,
Mayor of San Francisco.
I am in favor of all things which will
add to. the attractiveness and advance
ment of the city and a good zoological
garden seems to me to be one of these. I
think Golden Gate Park would be the
proper place for it. It should be under the
control of the Park Commissioners, they
to appoint men of proper scientific train
ing for the immediate care of it. I think
all these things will come to us in time.
Just now" there are more important things
to be done than feeding animals, such as
reclaiming the acres of land out toward
the park. The animals already on exhibi
tion at the park could be made the foun
dation of a good zoological collection.
JOHN M'LAREN,
Superintendent of Parks.
A "zoo" should be established in a place
entirely separate and set apart for such
a purpose. And above all let it be big
enough. In this climate there is no need
of shutting most of the animals up in
cages. I would give a tiger at least an
acre to roam in" If I had anything to do
with it, and at least a quarter of an acre
for each large animal. 1 think somÂ«
where out in the Mission direction, where
it is more sheltered, would be the best
place for a zoological garden. A large
aquarium in connection with it would be
a good thing also. I should say one hun
dred acres would not be too much for a
good park. And a good collection of ani
mals, natives of California, should be in
sisted upon. We ought to have some an
telope and mountain sheep now. But the
first thing to do is to get the money to
maintain such a thing, and I am sure the
Park Commissioners could not do much
If anything, toward it with the small ap
propriations they have. And a "200- will
never amount to anything unless the right
man is in charge. A zoological society
should be formed and the whole thing be
under its direction and auspices.
W. M. BUNKER.
San Francisco needs other things in
preference to a zoological park, although
a "zoo" would be a great thing for stu
dents and lovers of natural history if
properly managed. A political 'â¢zoo
would be of no service whatever. Any
thing of that sort not managed on the
very highest lines is worse than useless.
A "zoo" to be successful must be under
the direction of a zoological society com
posed of scientific and business men in
about equal proportions. And the ani
mals themselves must be handled and
studied by experts used to fiandling them
and of scientific training. There is some
thing more in the object of a "zoo" than
simply throwing peanuts to the monkeys.
Â¦ For instance, the average aviary, peo
pled with all sorts of birds, is of no use
to science, for correct classification and
separation is necessary if a "zoo !: is to
be anything 1 more than a pleasing 1 spec
tacle. Four or five years ago I .was in
terested in the project t? have a '"zoo"
started out at Glen Park, and I am still
in favor of having one.
I have studied all the zoological collec
tions <>( the world with the same interest
that 1 neve studied the question of parks
and boulevards and ' I believe if San
Frpncisco decides to have one a special
park should be made or provided for it.
MRS. MARY M. KINCAID,
President Board of Education.
lam enthusiastically in favor of a "zoo"
for San Francisco. I think the value of
it in an educational way to the people of
the city and State cannot be overesti
mated.
LEVERETT L. LOOMIS,
Curator in Department of Or
nithology, California Acad
emy of Sciences.
San Francisco is not in line with the
other big cities of the world in that it
has not a "zoo." We should have
one and the way to get it is first
to provide the money and then the suit
able environment. neither of which
should be difficult in a city of San Fran
cisco's wealth and natural advantages.
The best zoological exhibits that [ know
of are these in the gardens at London
under the auspices of the London Zoolog
ical Society; the gardens at Berlin, said
to be the finest in the world; the national
exhibit at Washington and the Bronx
"Zoo" at New York. The man in charge
of the last named exhibit is W. t. li,>rn
aday, for years in the National Museum
at Washington.
Three things are necessary pre-eminent
ly in the founding and maintaining of a
scientifically useful zoological park. First,
the animals; secondly, an experienced
man to look after them, and thirdly, the
mow picturesque and natural environ
ment, best suited to the birda and beasts.
A great advantage here is the mild win
ter, allowing the animals to be kept out
of door?. I consider the aviary now In
thj park one of the finest in the world,
but it is not very valuable from a scien
tific standnuin'. for there js no designa
tion nor classification. I have noticed
peopls go aad look at the birds In the
aviary, lake note of their plumage, etc..
and then go to the museum to find their
names among the stuffed ani labeled
onesâ which shows that people are inter
ested in natural history. Another advan
tage of a suod zoo" is that animals are
where they become tamed in a degree
and can he studied, whereas in a wild
state they get out of the way of human
beings as fast as possible.
In managing a "zoo" a man of experience
will be posted, knows of mistakes mads
in other famous gardens and avoids them.
The "zoo" is only carrying out the Idea
started when the first public museum was
founded.
Docility of the
Polar Bear.
HITHERTO it has been supposed
that polar bears could neither
be trained nor rendered doci'.",
but now Richard Sawade. a wtll
known European tamer of animals ai*d
notable authority on bears in particular,
shows clearly that such a supposition i.Â»
entirely erroneous.
-ecured two polar bears some dm
ago and at once determined to train
them. In this he succeeded beyond his
expectationâ so well, indeed, that theso
monstrous animals now follow him as
obediently as <i<>KS. ready *t his slightest
nod to perform any of the little tr:cks
which they have learned from him. Their
education in this respect is not yet com
plete, but that they have learned more
than any of their ancestors la evident
t'M>m the fact that at a word from their
r.a.-ter they get up on their hind legs and
in this manner follow him at a respectful
distance like lackeys as he walks around
the room.
Mr. Sawade claims that polar bears are
endowed with more intelligence than i a
generally imagined and that if properly
handled they will in time becom* qioita aa
docile as other animals.HOW TO

THE governing of a municipality is in many re
spects like the managing of a large private :,ust- .
ness establishment. The same care is required in
watching the many details of public business that
is demanded of the merchant in the conduct of
his commercial affairs.
The methods used in business circles are constantly
changing. So with the city: conditions are altered from
time to time and revised methods must be adopted to
meet the changed circumstances. Merchants and manu
facturers of to-day operate on lines vastly different from
those followed a half century ago; while the tradesman
of 1850 smiled pityingly on the rude methods of hi.
predecessors of 1800.
To have a good city government we must first secure
gcod men for the chtd position's in the public' service.
In the early days of American cities this was not dii
ficult: but unfortunately it is extremely hard at the
piesenr time to get the Lest of our citizenship to accept
prblic office. Municipal patriotism is sadly lacking.
The American has a grand love of country and is ready
to spring to arms at any moment lor its defense. His
life is at the disposal of his nation. But you will find
a hundred leaders in society and business ready to bear
the burdens of war where one can be found willing to
assume the less spectacular but equally honorable duties
demanded of good citizenship in taking on Â«.:ms.e!t
the trials of carrying on the affairs of his city.
From the beginning of American history cities have
taken an important part in shaping the course of the
nation, and their part has become more prominent with
each year of national growth. In 1790 there were but
four American cities with a population of more than
10.000. and the population of the largest was on!y 40,000.
The problems of municipal government at the opening
of the nineteenth century were of small magnitude as
compared with the questions requiring solution to-day.
The real source of the nation's present greatness is in
its cities and it is vitally important that municipal prob
lems be zealously studied looking to a perfected system
of city government.
The growth of our large cities has been of such phe
nomenal rapidity that the style of government in many
v then is necessarily crude. Therefore Americans are
inclined to express a dissatisfaction with their cities be
came of an inferiority in many ways to the municipalities
of Europe. But we should remember that only in the
last decade have our busy people had time, so to speak,
10 consider municipal problems with the requisite care.
The advance in those ten year*, however, has been great
enough to arouse our hopes high for the future.
Speaking in generalities the best way to better our
cities is to educate public sentiment as to their needs.
The proper solution of the problems arising in our
municipalities is more important by far to the nation
than the settlement of the difficulties coming from our
attempts to govern Porto Rico. Cuba, the Philippines
and those other outside territories which we have under
taken to rule.
As I have said before, our citizens should have more
patriotism for their cities. They should be willing to
make sacrifices if necessary in order to accept places in
the governmental system of the city. An active and
lisrhteous public opinion will soon arouse the latent love
of home and city and good timber will everywhere be

available for filling the municipal offices that are sub
jefct to popular ejection. But the general trouble in
governing cities has not beenÂ«with the executive an I
legislative officers and lu-ads of departments elected by
the voters. The difficulty has been' in getting capable
men to perform the many small tasks required in oper
ating a modern city, ihe man who does business on
a large scale meets with this same trouble. He can
personally choose his st'b-managers and foremen, but
lie i? always bothered to secure efficient under work
men.
In our early days orr cities needed but few em
ployes. The officials of the cities and towns then knew
pcrsonal'y almost all the inhabitants â knew the char
acter of each and his capacity for certain work. There
were no extensive police and fire departments. Daily

attertion was not demanded for hundreds of miles of
public streets. There were no great parks to be main
tained. Each citizen provided for the sanitation of his
own home in his own way. and the extensive* health de
partment of the modern city was unknown. It was
comparatively easy fcr the head officials of the olden
timc city to select the few public employes required.
The public business .in the city of loot has increased
to such an extent that the problem of securing efficient
M. P. SNYDER
workers is all important. Itis impossible for the chief
executive of a city or the heads of departments to know
all the applicants for positions and they cannot act
upon personal knowledge in making appointments. As
7 ratural re>u!t ill-fitted men are found in all depart
nents and the public undertakings suffer immeasur
ably thereby.
lhe consequence of incompetence in certain branches
cf the public service is frightful. Appoint a watch
maker inspector of plumbing for a city, and what chance
have the inhabitants of securing reliable plumbing for
their homes? Yet just such ill-judged appointments
arc made with a terribje frequency in what are supposed
to be the best-governed cities of the land.
An efficient system of civil service is the only means
yet found of solving this difficult problem. Such a sys
tem should cover every department of the public ser
vice with irdnclad rules. The public employes shoitld
get their places 'solely by reason of fitness; tney >nou.d
keep their positions and secure advancement only on
account of meritorious performance of their duties.
I have been asked this question: "How would you
like to see American cities governed?" I answer: "By
the best men within the confines of the cities; and with
every branch of the government operated under the
strictest rules of civil service."
But I will be more specific in my effort to outline
plans for the betterment of American city government.
Every city should have an adequate charter, constitu
tion or written organic law. Such a basic law is in ac
cord with the American theory 0/ government, and is
the best safeguard that citizens 'can have against any
excesses of their public servants. The greatest need
of Los Angeles is a new charter adapted to the require
ments of our rapidly-developing city. The present city
charter was adopted in 1888, when Los Angeles had a
population of less than 40,000. That old charter is in
sufficient for the present city of more than 100.000 peo
ple.. We are greatly handicapped by this antiquated
charter. I find that many other cities labor under this
same difficulty.
' Public ownership of general utilities is admitted f>
be a good thing. No large manufacturing concern
would purchase a necessary commodity, such as water,
from outside parties if it could produce the needed ar
ticle cheaper and more satisfactorily for itself. Good
business principles demand that the public, incorporated
in municipalities, should provide, for itself those things
that are necessary for all the individual members of
the corporation at the lowest cost for the best service.
Experience has demonstrated that public ownership is
satisfactory to the people in general.
I thoroughly believe in a city owning its water plant.
Chicago furnishes a good example for those munici
palities not yet equipped with a publicly owned water
supply system.
When. Chicago acquired the properties of the pri
vate water company in 1852 her population was a trifle
over 50,000. From the initial expense of $.140,000 for
the first plant operated, the city's investment in this
branch of the municipal service has reached the sum
of $Â4,000,000, all of which has been supplied by the
revenues of the department. At this time the annual
revenue of the Chicago water system is 400,000, or
10 per cent on the total investment.
â¢ Happily for Los Angeles she is about to come into
full ownership and control of her water supply system.
our voters having recently authorized the issuance of
$2,000,000 in bonds to secure the desired result. The
large majority of. our citizens are convinced that our
water supply will be more abundant and of a better
quality under municipal control, and that water rates
will be more satisfactory- '
In an expansion of municipal ownership to lighting
plants, street railways, telephone lines, etc . we should
move slowly and conservatively. It is reasonable to
suppose that municipalities will gradually take unto
themselves the ownership and operation of all plants
supplying public necessities. I believe that our cities
will meet with success in assuming these great burdens.
For the practical city official no problem met in the
conduct of a municipality is more perplexing than the
difficulty encountered in keeping the public .streets
clean. The system of hand sweeping seems to be the
most efficient for paved streets. The hand sweeper?
should be kept on the paved streets at all hours of
1 the day in order to keep the business thoroughfares in
the best possible condition. The hand sweeping of a
city's streets, in my opinion, can be performed more
efficiently if under the direct management of the proper
city department than if intrusted to private contractors.
One of the most important and most neglected de
partment* in our system of city government is the
branch of the government providing for the protection
of the health of our citizens. In order to have the
greatest prosperity in a city we must have first-class
sanitary conditions. The Health Board of a city should
be unhampered m its administration of this particular
department and should have the sole t>owÂ»r of aoooint
ing and removing the employes engaged in this im
portant part of the municipal government.
In many cities the legislative branch of the city Ins
the power to appoint and remove employes in the
Health Department and in other departments as "well.
In mv opinion the powers of the legislative branch of
the city Â«hnÂ»ild be limited to law miking. All.ta'mer
ing by officials who have secured their places in political
battle* with the various departments not direct'v under
their jurisdiction yVmVi be prevented. Especially does
this anply to the Hc?l*h Department.
j Strict rules of civil service should be applied to
! every department of the .nunicipa^tv. Let os restrict

i secure this ''devoutly wished for" consummation. '. ; ;â¢Â»-Â¦Â¦' *

/-yOSMOPOLITAN San Francisco' has
I / had a taste of every kind of beauty
\[ m \ known to the stage. . The latest
type upon which it has -passed
judgment is the beaming, the rosV.
the blue-eyed and the dark-haired ,. Irish
type.
Stuart Robson brought a little Limerick
girl to San Francisco, set her up on the
stage to play the role opposite to his
stellar self when Bertie the Lamb makes
love to Agnes, the ward, and not a dozen
people in the Columbia Theater knew
that she had left her brogue only three
years -behind and not long enough for Her
to escape disappointment at the Sham
rock's defeat.
Of all the stage histories of American
actresses there isn't one like hers. An
American manager, loafing through a.va
cation In England, strayed into a subur
ban theater, where an company,
dusty from the road, was playing "The
Brave Irish Peasant." Mary Realty,
plump, pretty and inexperienced, was in
the cast and the managerial eye lighted
upon her. The upshot was her American
appearance. *-;*<,
"Faith, an' what will I do with", my
brogue?" said she to the manager.
"Leave it at the Custom-house." re
plied he.
But it wasn't left there. It was only
by persistent work, work, hard work, thus,
she got rid of it, and even now her Eng
lish slips occasionally, she says.
It is just three years since she left her
native Limerick. It was near Limerick
that she made her first appearance on
the stage.
"Like all Irish girls, I went through a
course of convent training," she says,
"and the stage was entirely foreign to
the thoughts of either my parents or mj
se!f. My first public appearance wa.<
made five year:* ago in a little suburb of
Limerickâ Braghhoogan by name. l y had
no professional aspirations even then, for
the performance was an amateur ben'et.t
for thf Irish peasantry whose crops had
been spoiled by the terrible potato insect.
The place we appeared in had formerly
been a barn. The rafters of the roof wero
covered with sod and the place was heat
ed with peat and lighted by little can
dles. The audience, every man "and wo
man of which smoked small clay pipe*
(the custom in my country) were seated
on logs and planks. The price of admis

How Eil If ye iOasp.scQVered
COLONEL "BILL" ROOT of Lara
mie, Wyo., the dealer in wild ani-*
mals and discoverer of "Bill Nye,"
and who now has charge of the In
dian village at Glen Island, tells the fol
lowing story of how he "discovered" the
humorist:
" 'Bill Nye,' when he was a young man,
wasn't much; in tact, folks in L<yamie
wondered whether he would eventually
dry up and blow away or just die of plain
starvation. Things never would come his
way and that same way led through many
rocky places. Everything to which he
turned his hand seemed to wither under
it, and he began to think that he was a
'hoodoo.'
"Bill was a pretty discouraged sort of a
cuss when I said tv him and his v/ife cne
<i:Â»y: 'Conic <ut to the runcri and stay
with me for a, while,! and they came. Long
before this time Frances, Bill's wife, had
made' up her m;nd that Bill was cast in the
mul'i oi a lawyer, $nd nothing wouui do
but Bill must study law. So Bill camÂ«
â¢ along with his old booKS and would wan
oer around the ranch trying to imbibe
i zone ar.a j>4t;es of Blacxstone. But the
i-ankei worm h,t worry was in his mind,
and the ozone and several of the thjngs
I had -in a cupboard seemed to do little
good.
"Every little while BUI would sneak
away, write something he called funny,
send it away, and anxiously wait for the
lightning, in the shape of a check, to
strike. Now, Frances discouraged all this.
She wanted the law or nothing. She felt
that once Bill hung out his shingle all the
world would immediately get into trouble
and half of it would" fall all over itself to
get into Bill's office.
"Well, one day Bill met me about three
miles away from the ranch and said: 'Bill,
I want your advice. I've got something
in my pocket and on my mind, and I want
you to tell mfc what to do.'
"With that he unbuttoned his coat and
pulled out a letter from a Denver news
paper inclosing a check for $20, showed it
THE SUNDAY CALL.
to me, and asked, 'Shall I become a funny
man or a lawyer?' I looked at Bill, and
then at the check, and back at Bill again.
That check surprised me even more than
It did him. But I was there to give judg
ment, and had to do it. *
" Â¦Bill." I said, 'if you can find foolish
people anywhere in this world who are

OF CHOOSING MAYOR APPROACHES
Wells Is Practically Out of the Race-â Candidates
on His Ticket Are Trading With the Labor
Party Nominees and Tobin IsTaking First Place
J~) VSIXESS men of San Francisco who desire an honest ad
Â£j ministration of affairs for the people should combine their
strength and cast it in favor of Joseph S. Tobin. Asa R.
Wells is the candidate of the bosses and corporations, Eugene E.
Schmitz is tJte leader of disturbing elements. The safe man is
Tobin. All the shouting to the effect that Wells is gaining support
from the conservatk'C forces of citizenship is simply campaign noise.
The example of George K. Fitch, Thomas Magee and E. B. Pond
should not be lost sight of by the taxpayers who desire clean local
government. All good men of the city, irrespective of party, should
unite on Tobin and save San Francisco.
THE battle between Tobin and
Sehmitz is a rontesn that engages
the attention of voters in every
district of the city. The sup
porters of Bchmitz are trading
right and left and offering to
sacrifice all the candidates for "subordinate
pltces to give strength for the head of the
ticket. The trading is conducted chiefly
v,:th Republicans. The candidates on the
Republican ticket have 5t in for Wells, as

GREAT AUDIENCE OF LABORERS ON WATER FRONT CHEERS JOSEPH S. TOBIN FOR HIS MANLY UTTER
ANCES CONCERNING THE INTERESTS OF WORKINGMEN IN THE PRESENT CAMPAIGN AND FOR HIS
EFFECTIVE REBUKE OF HOODLUMS WHO TRY TO CREATE DISORDER.
WORKINGMEN ON THE WATER FRONT LISTEN
TO ADDRESS BY A WORKINGMAN'S SON
JOSEPH S. TOBIN was given an
enthusiastic reception during the
noon hour yesterday, when he ad
dressed a large crowd of working
men at the foot of Folsom street,
just outside the United States
army transport dock. His audience was
composed entirely of workingmen.
Fringing the crowd was a collection of
water front derelicts, aroused from their
lumber pile couches by the cheers which
greeted the candidate for Mayor. When
Tobin was almost through with his ad
dress Isadore Less, the barber, who is run
ning for Auditor on the Labor Union party
ticket, acconfpanled by a bodyguard, drove
into the crowd surrounding the speaker.
The bodyguard, another barber, jumped
to the seat of the buggy and with a yell
that spoke better for the strength of his
lunga than for his conception of common
decency cried, "Three cheers for
Schmltz." The crowd resented the inter
ruption, but when he threw into the air a
few packages of election cards the fringe
of th^ crowd disturbed the meeting by
scrambling for them. The fringe also
took up the Schmitz cry. The real audi
tors, the workingmen, were for resenting
the interruption, and but for the tact of
Tobin there would have been trouble.
"That's all right." said Tobin. "Every
body is entitled to three cheers at some
time. Let's make this unanimous."
Standing to his full height. Tobin then

ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCES GIVE
UNDOUBTED ASSURANCES OF THE
SUCCESS OF ANTI-BOSS TICKET
Candidate for Mayor Makes a Frank Declaration
of His Policy in the Event of Election and
Ends Campaign With Three Rousing Meetings
JOSEPH S. TOBIN attended three rousing meetings last night
fj and at each one there was convincing evidence of the popular
ity among all classes of citizens of the anti-boss candidate for
Mayor. He explained the actual status of the Mission track ques
tion, and showed how its settlement could be delayed indefinitely
by a corporation controlled Mayor. He spoke of the great poivers
invested in the Mayor by the charter, and told how he proposed to
exercise those pmvers in the eventof his election. He promised to in
vestigate all charges of extravagance or bad policy brought against
any commission under the Mayor's control and to use his pozver to
the limit in curtailing and correcting whatever evils should be dis
covered.
THE three meetings that Joseph
S. Tobin addressed last night,
the last important meetings of
the campaign, demonstrated the
fact that citizens of all classes
are looking to him as their cham
pion in the cause of good civic govern
ment and that they intend to make him
the next Mayor of San Francisco.
There was probably never before a can
didate for any office in the gift of the
citizens whose personality appealed to
those with whom he came in contact as
does that of Tobin. Throughout the cam

occasions when the enemy has apparently

most enthusiastic of the campaign. At

UNION LABOR'S OFFICIAL JOURNAL RINGS
OUT A WARNING TO WORKINGM EN VOTERS
SHOWS DANGER
OF SUPPORTING
LABOR TICKET
Says Administration by
Class Would. Put Nail
in Coffin of .Unions
Prophesies Low Rate of
Wages if Schmitz Is
Elected Mayor of City
THE dangers of a class adminis
tration in municipal affairs are
presented in the editorial, under
the heading "Our Last Word of
Warning." in Organized Labor,
- published by the labor unions of
Ban Francisco, in yesterday's issue. The
editorial is as follows:.
When the community is prosperous, the trades
unions in that community are also prosperous,
and each Individual member thereof. If you
desire to vote prosperity away from San Fran
cisco; if you desire to vote to disband your
tinoins; if you want to vote the money out of
four own pockets; if you like to vote the
bread away from your wife and childrenâ then
vote the class ticket, the worst class ticket,
the Union Labor party ticket, and you will
have accomplished all these. Yes, more, you
will have put a nail into the coffin of trades
unionism as far as San Francisco is concerned
for the r.ext ten years. Already we can point
to millions of dollars' worth of work which is
lying in the architects' offices awaiting the
result of the municipal election.
Capital is timid, capital is j-esentful, and
ta.pita.l is at times arbitrary; Tiut labor, the
father of all capital, can, as a prudent and
wise parent, work harmoniously with its son
Â»nd offspring; but if the father gets Intoxi

moment of frenzy^ drives the son that should

the result is always the same. Capital has
tone into hiding and labor is begging for em
ployment. Do you want such a condition in

torn to pieces, your wages reduced to $0 75 a

EVIDENCE FOUND JUSTIFYING
CHARGES AGAINST E. E. SCHMITZ
â HE following statement was issued by the secretary of the Build
' ing Trades Council at a late hour last night relative to the charges
brought against Eugene E. Schmitz, the Labor Union party candidate
for Mayor: â¢ ;
JL "The executive board of the Building Trades Council, In conform
ity with the instructions of the council, met this evening for the pur
pose of investigating the charges made against Eugene B. Schmitz, the can
didate for Mayor on the Labor ticket, the charges having been preferred by
three members of unions affiliated witrT the Iron Trades Council and published
in the local papers.
"A number of witnesses were examined and considerable evi
dence elicited, sufficient to convince the board that there exists
good grounds for the charges,
"Owing to the lateness of the hour and the desire of the board to afford
the accused an opportunity for a fair and impartial hearing, the board ad
journed its session and will resume the investigation to-morrow (Sunday), at
3 o'clock, at the Carpet Mechanics' Hall, 7 City Hall Square."

when he left it waa with the friendship
and admiration of every man in the hall.
Colonel T. F. Barry was the first speak
er of the evening. In the course of his
speech he said that he was there to
answer any questions that might be put
to him. A man in the audience arose and
said:
"I want to ask you how much salary
Mr. Tobin receives as attorney for the
Hibernia Bank?"
Colonel Barry started to reply when
Tobin jumped to his feet, pushed Barry
to one side and facing the audience said:
"I will answer that man. My salary is
less per month than my opponent on the
Union Labor ticket got for the job he did
for the Risdon Iron Works last June."
The audience, composed largely of
workingmen, rose to their feet and
cheered. Barry finished his speech and
gave Tobin a formal introduction to his
audience.
TEBiLS OF THE CAHPAIGN.
Has Confined the Fight to the Busi
ness Issues.
When the cheers, which were renewed
as Tobin faced the audience, had ceased
he s^oke as follows:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: I hope
that in this, almost the last meeting of
this campaign, I have not been betrayed
into an expression that might, in Its tone*,
indicate anything of bitterness. Whatever
the individual feelings of any man upoÂ»
any ticket may be, after all, gentlemen,
we are all citizens of San Francisco. We
are working for the best interests of San
Francisco as we see them. We are helÃ
ing to build up the future prosperity of
San Francisco as we conceive it to be,
and whether we be on this ticket or that
ticket or the other ticket, gentlemen, let
us remember that we are fellow citizens
and fellow men and live In peace, in
prosperity and in generosity of spirit.
(.Applause.)
"I have in this campaign assailed no
body. } have criticized nobody. I have
expressed personal animosity toward no
one and I shall not now if the questions
directed to me are confined within the
limits that I know you will confine them
If you ask me questions. I shall not break
the rule that I started out to carry
through in this campaign, to conduct it
in an honest, manly, straightforward
spirit.
"Gentlemen, it has been said south of
Market street that I am out of touch
with the people that live there; that I do
not represent them; that my people are
not their people; that my interests are not
their interests. Gentlemen, I deny this
absolutely, Wholly, entirely. My people
have lived in San Francisco for fifty
years and more. (Applause.) They have
prospered with the prosperity of San
Francisco. They came here poor. I was
born poor. I have poor Wood in my veins
and I have gone through the hardships
of poverty just as much as any man in
this audience and I appreciate and I feel
and I sympathize with the character, the
aspirations and the spirit of the poor, the
downtrodden and -the oppressed, whether
they are in San Francisco or whether they
are in New York or whether they are in
New Orleans or whether they are in South
Africa beneath the banner of the Boers.
(Applause.) Gentlemen, no man can say
to my face that I have not got the spirit
of a Democrat In my soul. (Applause.) I
hope that whatever the result of this
campaign may be one thing shall be es
tablished and it is this: That you will
all know me for a young man just like
every young man in this audience, no bet
ter and no worse, I hope. That I am
THE FAN FrMNCjSCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1901.
like you; that I feel like you and have
hopes like you, and just as patriotic as
you are and just as honest and feel as
deeply my obligations as a citizen as you
gentlemen. If nothing else results from
this campaign than this I shall consider
that I have indeed been fortunate; that
I am jndeed blessed by the best blessings
of heaven.
"You do not care to hear at this time
any discussion upon the principles of this
campaign. Those things are all passed
and done with now. I have gone before
you, discussed this campaign and Its
issues upon principles that appeal to me
as the proper principles, upon business
principles. I have conceived municipal
government to be nothing else than the
proper assessment, proper taxation and
the proper administration of the finances
of the city. This has been my goal.
"To this I have directed all by efforts.
And I think, gentlemen, that as citizens,
as business men, as practical men who
have their business interests here, whose
children live here, whose future pros
perity depends upon the prosperity of this
city, I know and I feel that all such men
will sustain me in this campaign and the
result will be a victory for the Demo
cratic party. (Applause.)
"Gentlemen, this is perhaps the last
meeting we shall have in this vicinity. I
want to thank you all for the kindness
and the courtesy with which I have been
treated on this occasion and on the pre
vious occasions, and I want to repeat
it now that if I have shown myself to Be
nothing more than a plain, ordinary,
every-day American citizen to those who
perhaps believed that I was something
other than this, no matter what the re
sult is, gentlemen, I will consider that I
have achieved a victory. I thank you
gentlemen."
STTRE OF ELECTION.
Although neither brass band nor bon
fire proclaimed to the neighborhood that
a political meeting was in progress, Na
tive Sons' Hall, on Seventeenth street,
near Valencia, was crowded with citizens
of the Thirty-fourth Assembly District.
Charles D. South was in the chair and
soon after Tobin's arrival he Introduced
the candidate to the audience.
Again there were cheers to proclaim his
popularity and as on every similar occa
sion during the campaign, he found him
self with friends. He spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: In the course
of this campaign we have discussed many
things incident to a discussion of the platforms
of the various parties. It has been our pur
pose, at the outset, and I believe we have car
ried out that purpose, to present to the citizens
of this city but one issue, namely, the business
management of the municipality, or as it has
been so often and tersely expressed, "muni
cipal government is business, not politics." We
have pointed to our record during the past
two years and as a guarantee of our future
actions we stand upon our platform fortifl>id
as it is by the record that we have made.
After all, gentlemen, to men who pay taxes
and live in San Francisco the question of city
government presents nothing else than the so
lution of the question: How shall our money
best be expended. In whose hands shall it be
administered the most honestly, and to whom
shall we look for cleanliness and independence
in public life. Others have discussed this cam
paign from different standpoints.- The stand
point of the nominee upon the Republican
ticket, as it has been so well expressed in one
of the dally papers, is the standpoint apparent
ly of locality and refreshment. We have pre
sented to you our views; we have stated to
you distinctly and accurately our principles
and what we believe to be the proper munici
pal policy of San Francisco upon every ques
tion that has been presented to us. We have
shirked nothing; we have refused to answer
nothing. We have stated accurately, distinct
ly, upon the stump from one end of San Fran
cisco to the other what we conceive to be the
principles involved and what we conceive to
be the proper answer to the Issues presented
by the various platforms. Gentlemen, at this
time we can do no more. I feel that behind
me will be found every man who is interested
In making the city of San Francisco clean,
wholesome and livable. I feel that behind
me on November 6 will be found every prac
tical, honest, business-like citizen of San Fran
cisco who wishes the city to advance, who
feels that the prosperity of the city Is his
prosperity, who feels that municipal govern
ment le business, not politics, and who feels,
I know, that the Democratic party during the
last two years has given an honest, clean, de
cent, elevating administration of city govern
ment. (Applause.) Gentlemen, I thank you.
FK/0 BUSES INVESTIGATION.
The last of the meetings was held In
the Young Men' # s Christian Association
Hall on Mission Â»treet. near Twenty
third. Here again a large audience
greeted the candidate for Mayor and once
more he found encouragement for the bo
lef that Tuesday will see his election by
a good margin.
He spoke of the railroad tracks through
the Mission and gave his pledge that in
the event of his election he would make
it his early business to Investigate all the
commissions under control of the Mayor
and see to the proper and Immediate cor
rection of whatever abuses and inconsis
tencies were found to exist. His address
was as follows:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen! The task has
been fulfilled. We have Just about oom
pleted an obligation of civic patriotism. This
campaign is all but concluded. I feel, gentle
men, and I know that upon November 5 will
be found behind us every man who loves San
Francisco, who . would make San Francisco
clean and wholesome and livable, who has nib
property Invested in San Francisco and hopes
to see her prosperous and vigorous in the fu
ture. All these will be found behind us, gen
tlemen, and it is needless to say that all these
comprise more than a large majority of the
electors of San Francisco. (Applause.)
To you people who are In the Mission there
Is one point which directs you intelligently
and without a deflection to the position occu
pied by the leading candidate upon the Repub
lican ticket, and I refer to his action with
regard to the Mission tracks. He refused to
cay that he would carry out the law. He re
fused to pledge himself that he would see that
the ordinance of the Board of Supervisors, was
fulfilled; and this was no- ordinary pledge that
you asked of him, gentlemen; it was not a
pledge In the usual significance; it was not a
pledge to put somebody In office or to expel
somebody from office; it waa not a pledge to
do anything that in any way conflicted with
any man's idea of what was right and proper.
It waa simply a pledge to discharge the law
as he finds it, and he refused to give you
that pledge, and. gentlemen, you know the
power that prevented him giving you that
pledge. This, gentlemen, is the sole, and to
me and to all of us, the all-sufficient reason
why the Republican ticket does not represent
the citizens of San Francisco, and this is the
all-Bufflcient reason why it represents the
Southern PacWc Railroad Company. Gentle
men, in a statement to-day in the newspaperb
he. says that the matter Is in the courts and
he cannot acÂ« what he has to do with It. Il
la easy for the administration to take It out
of the courts if they want to. It le easy for
the Board of Supervisors to extend to the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company a license
to run over these tracks, and that will knock
on the head the case of the city which Is
now in the courts.
Han he pledged himself that he will do this?
Has he said that he was In sympathy with the
movement to remove the tracks in the Mis
sion? No, gentlemen; you have ample evidence
that all we have said of him as the represen
tative of corporate aggression is absolutely true.
It is absolutely true that he consulted with the
leading attorney of this corporation. It has
never been denied. It is absolutely truÂ» that
he wanted an honest man placfea upon the
SCHMITZ SAYS
CHARGES ARE
MEANINGLESS
Refuses to Give Any
Explanation of Risdon
Iron Works Contracts
Has Nothing to Say Con
cerning the Evidence
of Recent Treachery
THE publication by The Call yes
terday of fac simile proofg of
Eugene E. Schmitz'a treachery
to the cause of unionism in hav
ing performed scab work for the
Rlsdon Iron Works proved to be
a veritable bombshell in the
labor ranks. The facts as brought out by
The Call were the subject of general dis
cussion among union men, and it goes
without saying that when these men vote
on Tuesday most of them will know how
to reward treachery to their cause.
In his campaigning speeches about town
last night, Schmitz stated in general terms
that the articles attacking him were lies
which were caused to be published by the
capitalists in order to Injure his candi
dacy. When seen by a Call reporter
after one of the meetings, and asked for
his opinion concerning the truth or
falsity of the article in question, Schmitz
declined to discuss the matter.
"I have no reply to make to the publi
cation by The Call," he said. "People
who know me know that there la ; noth
ing in the story."
"You performed the work for the Ris
don Iron Works at a time when you
knew that to do so laid you open to the
charge of scabbing, did you not?"
"I have nothing to say," was the firm
reply. "To spring such stuff at the elev
enth hour means absolutely nothing."
Schmitz refused to say anything further
concerning the charge made against him.
He said, however, that the labor ticket
waa growing In strength every hour and
that its election, despite the statements
of an antagonistic press, was an absolute
certainty.
Board of Supervisors and then he backed down
from his position and accepted the board as
prepared for him by the same attorney. It is
absolutely true that when confronted by a com
mittee from the .cftizens of the Mission, asking
him to pledge himself that he would carry out
the policy of the Mission with respect to the
double tracks, he refused to give an answer, he
avoided the question, he floundered and he gave
you ample evidence that he is what we have
all along contended he Isâ the representative,
not of the Republican party, not of the citizens
of San Francisco, but of the allied corporations
and the allied bosses. (Applause).
I have spoken upon this issue, gentlemen, be
cause I know every man in the Mission is con
versant with the status of affairs with respect
to Mission tracks. The city brought action
against the railroad company. Judge Seawell
decided in favor of the city and decided that
the railroad company had no franchise to run
cars on a certain portion of the track here and
that they must remove to the bay shore. That
decision has been appealed from and if the pol
icy of the present administration and the pres
ent City Attorney is carried out the Mission
tracks will be removed. But If you place in
power an administration that Is not in sym
pathy with that policy, that will direct the
City Attorney to delay the suit, to obstruct the
decision of the Supreme Court; nay, more, per
haps to grant them a license to run their cars.
It will be many a long day before the residents
of the Mission succeed In removing these tracks
from this district. (Applause).
The power of the Mayor under the
charter, gentlemen, is very great and
I desire to say now that if I am elect
ed that power will be used. If I
am elected extravagances that are
charged against any board, bad policy,
that is charged against any board,
will be investigated and that extrav
agance will be curtailed; that policy
will be corrected if those charges are
sustained. Under the charter the
Mayor has the power to remove any
elective officer in the city and county
of San Francisco with the concur
rence of fourteen members of the-
Board of Supervisors, and he has also
the power to remove any appointive
officer, any man who holds his offica
by virtue of an appointment, he hat*
the power to remove that man by
simply filing charges with the Board
of Supervisors and without going
through the formality of a trial.
These powers, gentlemen, will be
used. (Applause.)
All officers and all boards will be Investigated
and thoroughly Investigated by mÂ« If elected.
Every department of tne city government will
be placed under the eight-hour law regulating
hours of labor. Every department of the city
will have Its work done under the rules and
regulations, proper and moderaU as they are,
of the unions regulating that class of work.
Gentlemen, I cannot say any more at this time
than that I know and feel that I shall not be
offered up as a sacrifice for the good citizenship
of San Francisco. I know and feel that every
man In this audience to whom we have . ap
pealed as a practical business man, on practi
cal business lines and not as Dolltlclans beg
ging votes; I know that Â«vÂ«ry onÂ» of those
men will look at our record, examine our ca
reer, Inspect our platform, see what we have
done, and on November 5 Indorse us as honest,
clean, independent officials. Gentlemen. I
thank you. (Great applause.)

consequences were so lengthy and so un- damp climate East seemed to aggravate. Hartman Sanitarium Columbus O
Burns perceived that the drift of the
conservative mercantile and taxpaylns
vote was toward Tobin, hence they ro
solved to check the tide it possible by cir
culating reports that prominent bankers,
merchants and insurance men, who do not
usually take an active part in partisan
politics, were inclined to support Well*.
The stories of such support turned out to
be fakes. In the downtown business
houses, banks and insurance offices th<*
sentiment is largely in favor of Tobin.
Indications are that the business men
of the city will continue to line up for
Tobin. In no other way can Schmitz, a
class candidate, be defeated. Wells Is not
acceptable to the workingmen because he
is on record In opposition to the eight
hour law. He is not acceptable to the
taxpayers and ether friends of clean local
government because he la the candidate
of the bosa machine. The improvement
clubs and the Non-Partisan party arc
against him because he gives weak and
evasive replies to questions concerning
the management of municipal affairs. His
attitude is deplorable. Men who respect
his years and Lis nice qualities as an in
offensive man regret his weakness as a
candidate. In the light of events it is
seen that the conservative citizens. Irre
spective of party-, must unite on Tobin to
prevent the victory at the polls for
Schmita.
Attempts to create the impression that
Schmitz is attaching to his cause more
Democrats than Republicans have been
exposed as misleading. The standard
bearer of the labor agitators is getting
the bulk of his support from the ranka of
the Republican party. Abe Ruef and
Colonel T. V. Eddy, who were leading
orators in the McKlnley campaign, are
speaking for Schmitz. Democrats are re
turning to their party camp and giving
their strength to Tobin, but Republicans
of spirit and Independence are not going
to Wella. If they leave the camp or
Schmitz they will Join the Tobin forces.
Joseph 8. Tobin, nominee for Mayor,
was not hissed or insulted at the Metro
politan Temple mass-meeting Friday
evening. The Evening Post makes a big
epread of falsehoods to the effect that
tne audience hissed the nominee. The
facts are that remarks of C. Van Ness,
chairman of the meeting, were interrupt
ed. When he mentioned the name of
Schmitz some hired rowdies In the a-allery
etarted a noisy demonstration and dis
turbed the speaker. Mr. Tobin, however,
was greeted with generous applause. His
speech was not interrupted. He was not
hissed and there was no manifestation of
an unfriendly spirit by the audience.

Schmitz. Even the hoodlum element by
this time realized the Indecency of the In

Less and his bodyguard withdrew to a
distance with a few sympathizers. Less'
companion told them In strident tones that
when Eugene E. Schmitz reigned at the
City Hall it would be easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle than
for a property owner to get a hearing, and
that for the next two years San Francisco
would be run by a laboring man for the
exclusive benefit of the working classes.
Tobin continued his speech, and when he
took his departure It was with the cheers
of the workingmen ringing in his ears.
The Schmitz forces had arranged for a
counter-meeting at the same time and at
the same place, but the necessary orators
were not on hand and the meeting did not
take place. Long after the men had gone

Tobin was Introduced by Colonel T. F.
Barry and spoke as follows:
"I want to talk to you working men
and I want you to listen to me. WTÂ»en my
father came here he was poorer, prob
ably, than any one of you. He was In
every sense of the word a laboring man.
What hÂ« became later was by his own

REARDON REITERATES TRUTH
OF CHARGES AGAINST SCHMITZ
TO the Editor of The Call: As there is much discussion appearing ln
the newspapers as to the loyalty of the union cause shown by the
men who signed the protest against E. E. Schmitz, I deslde to sub
mit the following facts:
Ip to May 20 of this year, when the iron trades strike was de
clared, I was a marine steamfltter, for three years being employed
in the shops of Taylor, Adams & Pritchard, 12 Market street, and Delano Bros.,
21 Spear street, who paid me $3 50 per day for nine hours' work. Since the
strike commenced I have been acting as business agent for my union with
out any pay whatever. Xot as much as one cent of benefit money has ever
reached my pocket, as I have preferred to let men of family and those more
is need than myself be the ones to receive any benefits that were coming.
My union elected me to represent it in the Iron Trades Council, in which or
ganization I am a member of the executive committee.
I have always done my best to further the interests of the iron workers
in this strike, having acted on almost every committee for raising money,
arranging meetings, etc In all truth and fairness 1 can claim that there is
no man ln our strike who has its interests more at heart than myself, or who
wants to see the rights of the iron trades men protected more than I do. I
came out on this strike from the very beginning and will stay out until the
very end. I was born here in San Francisco and 1 challenge any man to con
nect me -with any dishonorable acts during my life, and I will say right here
that any information that properly belongs to any union man that I am con
nected with will always be forthcoming without fear or favor. Now, sir, the
above are facts. I signed that protest with others and lam willing to stand
by it, and it ill behooves those questioning any person's loyaity to unionism
who simply states what is true. Very respectfully yours,
San Francisco, Nov. 2, 1901. T. A. REARDON.
at the hands of Â¦union men. If you elect me as
your Major 1 assure you I will do everything
in my power to make the conditions of work
ing-men better than they are. We will give the
city a wise and conservative government and
one of which we will feel proud when our terms
expire. We need your help and 1 sincerely .trust
that after next Tuesday we will strike terror
into the hearts at professional politicians and
corrupt bosses.
The labor candidates next appeared it
"Wackenrueder's Hall, at Wool and Eu
genia streets, where a small crowd was
in attendance. At this point a plasterer
named Conlon attacked P. H. McCarthy
of the Building Trades Council for his at
titude toward the labor ticket. He de
clared that McCarthy was a dictator
whose word was utterly unworthy of cre
dence. When Schmitz rose to speak he
â¢was cheered with considerable enthusi
asm. He said in part:
The union laboring men of the city should
rally to the support of the Labor ticket on
Tuesday. They should not be influenced by the
articles appearing in the papers concerning the
labor candidates, for all of them are inspired
and paid for by the capitalists who control the

GREAT GROWTH
OF THE WEST
Wonderful Strides Are
Made Within Louis
iana Purchase.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â The ap
proaching centennial celebration of the
Louisiana purchase has suggested to the
treasury bureau of statistics the compila
tion o" some data Regarding the present
condition and productions of the territory
included within that purchase. This> state
ment shows that the land area of the
Louisiana purchase exceeds that of the
original thirteen States, being 564,Â»i4
square miles, against a total land area
of 820,944 square miles in the original
thirteen States. The States and Territor- !
ies which have been created in whole or \
in part from its area .number fourteen, I
and their population in 1900 was 14.705.616, i
against a population of less than 100,000 ,
in the, territory at the time of its pur
chase. Their total area is nearly one
third that of the entire Union, and their
population about one-fifth that of the en
tire United States.
They produced in 1890 164,000,000 bushels
of wheat and In 1900 264,000,000 bushels, at
a value in 1900 of $152,000,000, their total
wheat production being over 50 per cent
of that of the entire United States. They
produced 603,000,000 bushels of corn in 18H0
and 1,013,000,000 bushels in 1900, with a
value in 1900 of $314,000,000, their total corn
crop forming in 1890 40 per cent and in 1900
48 per cent of the total corn crop of the
United States. Of oats they produced in
1900 311,000,000 bushels, or 38 per cent of
the total product of the country, with a
valuation of $71,000,000. Their production
of barley in 1900 was valued at over ?10,
00,000, and of rye over $2,000,000; while
their production of potatoes in 1900
amounted to over $25,000,000, that of hay
$130,000,000 and that of cotton $50,000,000 in
value. The total value of the agricultural
products of the States formed from the
Louisiana purchase, including in that cat
egory simply wheat, corn, oats, barley,
rye, hay potatoes and cotton, was in IS9O
-',000. and In 1900 $755,000,000. The wool
product of these States amounted to 61,
871.357 pounds in 18&4 and in 1900 to 100,
396,982, or 35 per cent of the total wool
product of the country, with an estimated
value of about $15,000,000, or equal to the
cost of the entire area. The value of the
! farm animals in these States in IS9O was
?772.00Ci,000. and in 1900 $825,000,000. Add to
these easily measured farm products the
estimated value of the wool, the sugar,
the dairy and. poultry products and the
proportion of the livestock annually
j turned into provisions and It may be
I safely estimated that their agricultural
j products during a single year amount to
one hundred times the original cost of
the area, or. In other words, that Its cost
is repaid by 1 per cent of the agricultural
productions of each recurring year.
The product of the mines is also very
great. The coal produced in this area in
1Â«# amounted to 22,000.000 tons, against
14.000.W0 in 1890; the iron ore to 8,491.000
tons in 1900. against 1,269.000 tons in 1890;
the silver product of 1899 was $50,300,768
in coinage value, against $44,799,998 in 1890,
and gold, $37,712,400 in 1899, against $10,
650,000 in 1890.

anywhere. They are all hard-working men and
they represent the class to* which I am happy to
saj- I belong. I have been selected to represent
the whole people and not a class. I believe in
equal privileges to all and special privileges to
none. If 1 am elected Mayor I will see to It
that your section is not neglected. You should
not fail to vote the Labor ticket straight on
Tuesday next, and I leave the issue in your
hands.
The next place visited was a meeting of
the Thirty-first District Club at Harrt
gan's Hall, at Eighth and Folsom streets.
Schmitz was well received here, and when
called upon to speak delivered the address
quoted above. Teutonia Hall, at Ninth
and Howard streets, was then visited,
w-ere Schmitz addressed tne boxmakers,
who were giving a party to their women
friends. He again alluded to the attacks
made against him by a hostile press and
urged his hearers not to pay any atten
tion to what he termed "campaign lies
which are paid for." Other speakers
were Messrs. Eagan, Daughney, Kugler,
Getchell, Kenney and Roberts. At the
conclusion of his speech at this hall
Schmitz retired to his home.
TURKEY YIELDS
TO THE FRENCH
Sultan Again Promises
to Pay All Demands
Made.
PARIS. Nov. 2.â The dispatch of Ad
miral Caillard's squadron from Toulon to
Turkish waters has already had its ef
iect. The French Foreign Office to-day
received a telegram from M. Bapst,
Councillor of the French Legation at Con
stantinople, announcing that the Sultan
yesterday sent him a message accepting
all the trench claims, including the Lor
endo claim. The Porte also telegraphed
to the French Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, If. Del Casse, informing him that
the Lorendo claim had been settled and
that the Sultan had signed an irade ac
cepting the figure nxed by France for the
payment of the claim. M.. Del Casse pro
ceeded to the Elysee Palace and to the
Ministry of the Interior, and consulted
with President Loubet, the Premier, M.
Waldeck-Rousseau, and the Minister of
Marine, M. de Lanessan. He afterward
had another conference with M. Waldeck-
Rousseau. It is said the French Govern
ment also demands an undestanding that
Turkey will not renew the recent interfer
ence with the diplomatic mail bags.
LONDON, Nov. 2.â A dispatch to a
news agency from Rome says that the
second division of the Italian Mediter
ranean squadron has started for Turkey,
that the object is said is to counterbal
ance the French naval demonstrations.
PROTECTORATE OVER SYRIA.
NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â A World special
from Paris says: France demands a vir
tual protectorate over Syria as compensa
tion for the attempt made upon her pres
tige in the East by Turkey. This is in
addition to the satisfaction of all her
other claims against the Sublime Porte.
Information received through the Turk
ish Embassy confirms the report that
the Sultan has accepted all the French
claims, including the Lorando claim. But
the French Government will not accept
this settlement, and now requires the fu.
ther satisfaction of the protectorate over
Syria. An official of the Foreign Office
said to-day:
"The Sultan is mistaken if he imagines
that he can arrest the march of our war
ships by such expedients."
Meanwhile the warship activity at Tou
lon continues and the French squadron is
proceeding toward Turkey for the purpose
of making a naval demonstration. Bey
rout is now said to be the objective point.
territory. Their capital stock amounted
in 1900 to over $80,000,000: their circulation
to $36,600,000 in 1900, against $15,644,000 in
1890; their loans and discounts to $317,563 -
00 in 1900, against $269,016,000 in IS9O, and
their total resources, $1,099,111,000 in 1900
against $746,903,000 in 1890; while a still
more gratifying evidence of the prosperity
of this section is in the fact that Individ
ual deposits in national banks in 1900
amounted to $329,699,000, against $216,609,000
in 1890, an increase of more than $110,000,
00 in individual deposits during the de
cade.
A study of educational conditions shows
equally rapid and gratifying development.
The pupils enrolled in the public schools
in the States in auestion in 1890 num
bered 2,580,495, and in 1899, 3,161,112; the
teachers emrjloyed numbered in 1890 89 -
58, and in 1899, 102.202, and the expendi
tures for public schools in 1890 was $30 -
284,752, and in 1899, $37,185,881. The num
ber of pupils in attendance at high schools
in 1899 was 113,847. with 4937 teachers; at
normal schools, 15,843 students, with 625
teachers, and at higher educational insti
tutions, 40,249 students, with 3925 teachers
The total figures for schools and educa
tional institutions in the fourteen States
formed from the Louisiana purchase
show: Teachers in IS9O, 95,365; in 1599, 111 -
689; attendance in 1890, 2,670,541; in 1899
3,331,051.
The number of newspapers and period
icals published in this area in 1890 was
4759. and in 1900, 5618; the number of post
offices in 1890, 12.919, and in 1900, 16,228
the miles of railway in operation in 1890
numbered 51.823, and in 1899, 59,324, or 31
per cent of the total railway mileage of
the country.
The power of this vast area, with its
agricultural and mineral wealth, to sus
taian a population much greater than that
which it now supports is suggested by a
comparison of its area with the area and
population of the prosperous countries of
Europe. The total area of the Louisiana
purchase (including land and water sur
face) is 875.025 square miles, and Is slight
ly less than that of the United Kingdom
the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany'
France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland,
whose total area is 885.978 square miles
with a present population of 202.363.573 as
against a present population of 14,708,616
In the territory under consideration,
whose agricultural and mineral possibil
ities fully equal those of the European
states named.
WELLS CLOSES
HIS CAMPAIGN
IN ONE SPEECH
Railroad Candidate for
Mayor Talks to Small
Crowd at Twin Peaks
Gives Audience Nothing
of His Opinions and
Ignores Vital Issues
ASA R. WELLS closed his cam
paign last evening with a speech
addressed to eighty-four voters
of the Thirty-sixth District,
who gathered in Twin Peaks
Hall, Noe and Seventeenth
streets. The railroad candidate
for Mayor again avoided any reference to
the vital issues of the campaign and in
formed his slim audience that if the mem
bers desired to learn anything as to his
opinions they might do so by reading "his
policy of administration," which Southern
PEcific wire pullers have put forward for
him.
The fight of Wells to be elected Mayor
of San Francisco ended in the faint ap
plause of a few admirers and a crowd of
little boys.
The speech made by Mr. Wells was as
follows:
My Friends: I did not Intend to go out at all
this evening, but I was urged to do so by some
friends in this district, where I have a great
many eood, substantial friends. It Is not ex
pected that I am to say much about the Is
sues. That, I think, has been fully gone over.
My views are In print for everybody to read,
and I believe that you will be in perfect ac
cord with my intentions should I be elected.
I have been through this distirct some con
siderable within the last two or three weeks
and it is changed so very materially from the
days when I used to drive here and keut in
perfect touch with the improvements an>l
growth of this Important part of the city that
I hardly knew many faces that were familiar
to me. and I assure you that the district â
that the prospect it has for the future should
receive attention, and it will be my endeavor
should I be elected â which I will be â to en
courage your Supervisor from this district In
any good imiJrovement. I promise you that I
will not neglect you in the least in any matter
where I have anything to say about It. I ex
pect to hear good reports from this district on
election day. I am told by many substantial
Republicans in this district that they will poll
a very large Republican vote, and I believe it.
That being the case, why you certainly will be
entitled to a Republican administration, gen
tlemen, if for no other reason. There has been
something said about taking up railroad tracks.
I think if you will follow my published views
in regard to those things that you will see
that I have given the matter some attention
and that I will be your friend In whatever
course you will eventually wish to pursue in
that matter. I thank you.
The meeting was also addressed by
John Farnham, P. J. Gray, J. F. Ahearn,
Harry Baehr, William Offerman, Thomas
W. Collins, Char!*s A. Lcrtv, Js M. Wll

SCHMITZ IS NOT INDORSED
BY THE LABOR COUNCIL
Organization Follows Policy of the
American Federation and Keeps
Out of Politics.
The following communication from th<?
Labor Council sets at rest the assertions
made that the organization has given ita
indorsement to the candidacy of Eugene
E. Schmitz for Mayor:
To the Editor of The Call.â Sir: The Labor
Council, following the policy laid down by the
American Federation of Labor, has always re
fused to place itself on record for or against
any political parties. But here it ought to
be stated that again and again some inter
national unions affiliated with the American
Federation of Labor have by resolutions urged
upon their members independent political ac
tion. Following that policy a number of local
unions have Indorsed the Union Labor party.
So when a motion Friday night was made at
the regular weekly meeting of the Labor
Council to indorse the Union Labor party,
President Michael Casey refused to entertain
the motion, holding that such matters are out
side of the adopted policy of the American
Federation of Labor and thus outside of the
policy of the San Francisco Labor Council, the
local agent of the Federation. The president
stated In support of his ruling that a number
of affiliated unions had. as it was within their
province, indorsed the Union Labor party, and
â¢that the Labor Council was not called upon
nor should act on such matters. The dele
gates sustained the chair in his ruling.
This statement is issued because interested
parties are trying to mislead the pubflc as
to the intent of the Labor Council's action
on this matter. I am, yours truly,
ED. ROSENBERG.
Secretary San Francisco Labor Council.

A Most Remarkable Remedy That
Quickly Restores Lost Vigor
to Men.
A Free Trial Package Sent by Mail
toAll Who Write.
Free trial packages of a most remark-
able remedy are being mailed to all who
will write the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had battled
lor years against the mental and physical
suffering of lost manhood that the Insti-
tute has decided to distribute free trial
packages to all who write. "It is a home
treatment, and- all men who suffer from
any form of sexual weakness resulting
from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
cele or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where it is needed.
It cures all the Ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success in
all cases. A request to the State Medical
Institute, 328 Elektron building, Fort
Wayne, Ind., stating that you desire one
of their free trial packages, will be com-
plied with promptly. The Institute is de-
sirous of reaching that great class of men
who are unable to leave home to be
treated, and the free samples will enable
them to see how easy it is to be cured of
sexual weakness when the proper reme-
dies are employed. The Institute makes
no restrictions. Any man who writes will
be sent a free sample, carefully sealed in
a plain package, so that its recipient need
have no fear of embarrassment or pub-

without delay.

TRUSTEES FAVOR THE
TELEPHONE FIRE AT.A-R.ivr
Committee From Berkeley Board Re
ports System Entirely Feasible.
Recommends Its Cheapness.
BERKELEY, Nov. 2.â A special com
mittee on fire alarms reported last night :
at the Trustees' meeting that the tele
phone system of alarm was entirely feas
ible and about half as expensive as the
regular system. The committee was in- '
structed to confer with the telephone ':
company and find the expense of having
"central" turn alarms Into the fire houses
when the office Is rung up.
The proposed system provides that each ;
firehouse shall be connected with the cen- ,
tral telephone station by a private circuit, j
When an alarm Is turned into central i
from any residence telephone the operator
indicates to the flrehouses the location of
the blaze. The estimated cost of the sys
tem is less than $3000. Bids for supplying
the town with alarm apparatus of the 1
regular sort were rejected and the spe- '
cial committee, composed of Trustees |
Rlckard. HofC and President Marston,
was Instructed to report on the telephone
service at the next meeting.
Should the telephone tÂ»e adopted the
money saved will be spent in securing
fire apparatus.
Injured by Falling From a Car.
BERKELEY, Nov. 2.â Mrs. J. B. Henley
of 2036 Bancroft way had the right side
of her head badly cut and her right shoul
der and arm severely bruised late last
night by stepping from an electric car
while it was in motion and being thrown
heavily to the ground. Her head was cut
by striking the step of the car as she
fell. The accident occurred at Center

Dr. H. N. Rowell's office. Shortly after
midnight she was taken to her residence,
where she is now resting easily.
Transaction Was Straight.
OAKLAND, Nov. 2.â The Superior Court
of this county has decided that the sale of
property by J. S. Meyers, a well known
Oakland real estate dealer, to Mrs. Flora
Loughead was perfectly straight. Mrs.
Loughead thought that Meyers had made
a $400 commission on the sale and brought
suit for part of it. Meyers proved that
he had purchased the property many
months before the sale was made to Mrs.
Loughead and that he had made $350
worth of improvements upon it, so that
his actual profit was $50 on the transac
tion. Judge Ells-worth found with Mr.
Meyers on every point.

the publication of all the dispatches has

a Call representative that it would be
eminently unfair to publish this one dis
patch without publishing others which
are vital to an understanding of the one
on which the national controversy hinges.
To publish the hundreds of messages now
on file in the War Office directly bearing
on the subject means revealing to the
public secrets not intended to be made
known and the Implication of persons who
have so far escaped any odium. â¢
It is probable that the War Office will

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1901.
CHEERS GREET
DUKE OF YORK
Heir Apparent to Throne
of Britain Reaches
England.
LONDON, Nov. 2.â The cheers that
greeted the Duke and Duchess of Corn
wall and York to-day as they passed on
their return from their tour of the world
were intermingled with the shrill cries of
the newsboys shouting:
"Terrible disaster in South Africa!"
Beneath the jubilation on the safe ar
rival of the heir apparent there existed a
keen undercurrent of grief and anger over
the defeat of Colonel Benson's column. Of
the thousands who lined the route from
the Victoria station to Marlborougn
House many were personally concerned in
the 236 British, casualties incurred in this
latest reverse, and while the Duke and
Duchess were welcomed back with great
heartiness the crowds could not shut their
eyes to the mocking contrast between the
pageant 'and the serious news of the
morning.
Barring the unfortunate coincidence the
ceremonies passed off excellently.
The King and his reunited family bade
farewell to Portsmouth to the strains of
the naval bands. All the ships in the har
bor were gayly dressed.
The royal train arrived at the "Victoria
station at 12:56 p. m. Immense crowds at
once gathered there to welcome the royal
party. Brilliancy was given to the scena
by the gay uniforms of the Coldstream
Guards, who, with scores of policemen,
guarded the depot. All the way to Marl
boruogh House the route was well lined,
and several parts were profusely deco
nited, colonial colorÃ being particularly
noticeable, while the Stars and Stripes
and the Danish flag were also frequently
seen. There were 4000 troops on duty. At
the Victoria station the colonial agents
presented an address to the Duke of Corn
wall and York, who replied in much the
same terms as he used earlier in the day
at Portsmouth, when he dilated on the
enjoyment he had derived from his trip
and his gladness at seeing his native land
again after his deeply interesting jour
ney, at every point of which he had been
profoundly impressed by the universal
declaration of loyalty to the throne.
The agents general of the colonies also
presented an address to the King, who
handed them a written reply, which was
as follows:
I thank you for your loyal and dutiful ad
drees on the return of my beloved son and
daughter-in-law from their visit to the por
tions of my realms of which you are the rep
resentatives.
It was not without natural anxiety an* h,eÂ«i
tatlon that I sanctioned the departure of the
heir apparent to the throne on a voyage which
Involved many months of separation, but it
was rÂ»y earnest desire to give effect to the
wishes of my late revered mother and to the
aspirations of my loyal subjects in the col
onies, of whose devotion and patriotism I have
received such signal proof in the splendid ser
vice they have rendered to the empire In South
Africa, and I am fully repaid by the com
plete success which attended the visit and by
the manifestations of devotion and loyalty
which the presence of the Duke and Duchess
everywhere evoked.
The procession occupied less than half
an hour ln traversing the short route.
The members of the royal families and
their suites were in open carriages. The
King wore a field marshal's uniform, the
Duke of Cornwall and York wore the uni
form of a rear admiral and Prince Ed
ward was dressed in sailor clothes. They
occupied the first carriage. The Queen,
the Duchess of Cornwall and York and
the Princesses Victoria and Charles of
Denmark were in the second carriage.
The household cavalry finished the escort
CLOSE VOTE EXPECTED
IN GREATER NEW YORK
An Impartial Poll Made by Newspap
ers Gives Low a Small Plurality
Over Shepard.
NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â That the voters
of Greater New York are so evenly di
vided that a slight change of sentiment
may give victory either to the Democrats
or Fusionists Is the chief deduction to be
drawn from a careful and impartial poll
made by the Herald and Brooklyn Eagle
the latter confining its investigations to
the borough of Brooklyn. It indicates a
very slight advantage for the head of the
fusion ticket, as is shown in the following
comparison: Low's indicated pluralities in
Brooklyn and Richmond are 23,981; Shep
ard's indicated pluralities in Manhattan,
the Bronx and Queens are 10,098, and
Low's indicated plurality over Shepard in
Greater New Yoik is 13,883.

CHILE EXPLAINS
TO ARGENTINA
Says the Roads in Dis
pute Are Pathways
for Surveyors.
Belief Expressed at Washing
ton That Incident Is
Now Closed.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â lf Argen
tina and Chile engage in war, the greater
part of the South American continent will
be the scene of strife while the Congress
of Pan-American Republics for the pro
motion of peace is sitting in the City of
Mexico.
Peru and Bolivia are disappointed in not
getting a satisfactory settlement of the
Tacna-Arica dispute, and they will un
doubtedly press Chile should she become
involved m hostilities with Argentina, to
comply with their wishes relative to a
settlement of this question. Failure on
the part of Chile to do so will probably
cause them to range themselves on the
side of Argentina, even supposing they do
not in the beginning take this action.
These in brief are the probabilities in
the South American situation. Informa
tion concerning the exact status of the
latest dispute between Argentina and
Chile is unfortunately scarce in Washing
ton. The State Department has not heard
from its Minister in Buenos Ayres or from
its envoy in Santiago.
Chile Slakes an explanation.
Senor Del Vlso, the Argentina Charge
d' Affaires, was informed four or five days
ago that his Government had received an
explanation from Chile to which it was
giving consideration. Senor Infanta, the
Chilean Charge d' Affaires, has more com
plete advices. His cablegrams show that
Chile made an explanation and that it was
satisfactory to Argentina.
Rather than that war should take place
the United States will undoubtedly be pre
pared, upon the request of Argentina and
Chile, to use its good offices to arrange
amicably the question that is in danger
of embroiling those countries in strife. No
intimation has come to this Government
of any desire on the part of either Gov
ernment that President Roosevelt shall in
terfere. Senor Del Viso has not made any
representations to the State Department
regarding the boundary question, nor will
he do so without specific instructions from
his Government.
Reports of Trouble Discredited.
Senor Infanta discredits the reports of
trouble between the two Governments. He
said:
I do not believe that there is any intention
on the part of Argentina to withdraw Its rep
resentative. Advices received at the Chilian
legation hero show that the incident Is ended.
Argentina asked Chile for an explanation of
the construction of tbe alleged roads ln the
territory, the ownership of which Is now be
ing determined by arbitration. Chile explained
that the so-called roads were merely pathways
for the use of surveying expeditions. Both
Governments have surveyors in the disputed
region, and to facilitate their work lt is neces
sary to cut patbs for them. There was no
question of constructing roads. I understand
that the explanation was satisfactory to Ar
gentina, and the Incident was closed. Chile en-
Joys very cordial relations with Argentina an<l
I am satisfied that she has no desire or inten
tion of committing any act which might tend
to impair them.
In case of war the Argentina and Chil
ean navies would be evenly matched. The
naval policies of the two governments re
quire each to be as strong on the sea as
the other. Argentina has three battle
ships ranging in tonnage from 2036 to 4200
tons, against two battleships of Chile of
6900 and 3500 tons respectively. Argentina
has four armored cruisers, Chile two;
Chile has five cruisers, Argentina three;
Argentina has thirty-three torpedo boats,.
Chile has twenty-six. In order to protect
American interests in the event of hostil
ities the United States will strengthen )ts
South Atlantic squadron, and perhaps
form a South Pacific squadron.
Indies' Club.
This may very properly be the designa
tion of the composite observation car
which will be run on "Sunset Limited"
for New Orleans and New York tri-week
ly, commencing December 6. Contempla
tion of the varied scenery from easy
chairs on the roomy rotunda may be al
ternated with letter writing, scanning
books or periodicals from the library or
in receiving pleasing attention from the
trained maid constantly in attendance.
This highly attractive feature of "Sunset
Limited" is indicative also of the high
standard of excellence attained by th?
Southern Pacific Company in the equip
ment and service of this model train.
The total number of experiments on liv
ing animals in the United Kingdom ln 1900
was 10,839 â 2370 more than in the previous
year. It is stated that but few of these
experiments were in any serious degree
painful.

CONVEYS DRAFT
OF NEW TR EATY
Pauncefote Is Returning
With England's Assent
on Canal Project.
Nicaragua, However, Sud
denly Decides to Renounce
Existing Conventions.
LONDON, Nov. 2.â The first official
statement of any kind made for a month
in relation to the Nicaragua canal has
been obtained by a Call correspondent. It
confirms the fact that Lord Pauncefote,
the British Embassador to the United
States, when he lands ln New York to
day will have with him the draft of a
new treaty, abrogating the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty, which is in every particular
satisfactory to Lord Salisbury's Cabinet.
A correspondent interviewed Lord
Pauncefote in London, since which not
one word has been given out. The latest
dispatch from the United States is as
follows :
"All negotiations up to tne present day
have been entirely unofficial from a
strictly diplomatic point of view, and
that on pour parlers only depend the
hopes generally shared for a successful
bridging over of the diplomatic difficulty.
These pour parlers, however, have been
particularly searching.
"The State Department does not require
a copy of the document Lord Pauncefote
carries to learn its terms. Until the Em
bassador reaches Washington the exact
terms are withheld. Though ft is ad
mitted that Great Britain has agreed to
put the Clayton-Bulwer treaty to one
side and to acquiesce in the construction
of the canal by and under the control of
the United States, this concession from
Lord Lansdowne's original Intention has
not been granted without some real or
fancied advantage to Great Britain. It
would not be fair to say a quid gro quo
constituted the main feature of tne pro-,
tracted pour pariers, but that lt will
directly or inairectly result is firmly
established in the minds of the members
of the Cabinet."
Never Objected to the Canal.
One of the most responsible officers
connected with these and the earlier ne
gotiations, said:
"We never really objected to the con
struction of the canal, but we did and do
object to an abrogation of the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty." It was ln that spirit
that Lord Lansdowne couched his reply
to the United States Senate:
"It was not that you wanted to do it.
but the nasty way in which you said it.
Since then we have been approached in
p. rational, polite manner and we have
again endeavored to substitute for the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty a treaty that will
enable America to carry out a design
which, in a broad sense, would doubtless
benefit the whole world."
The mollification of the Foreign Office
has doubtless done more than anything
else to secure the assent of the British
Government to a new treaty. But in the
same breath must be mentioned the State
Department's willingness to a reciprocal
arrangement regarding the British West
Indies and other British possessions. This,
while in line with the views latterly at
tributed by cable dispatches to President
McKinley and President Roosevelt, waa
so at variance with the British Govern
ment's experience of the American atti
tude that they now regard it in the light
of a quid pro quo' for what they believe
to be a concession over the Nicaraguan
territory.
Some papers say Lord Lansdowne has
tamely given up inherent rights without
any return, which Is strenuously denied
on the foregoing grounds.
What is even more interesting Is the
fact that inner circles of the Cabinet are
not nearly so sure of the acceptance of
the convention as are some of the leading
papers on both sides of the water. When
the terms are announced it is feared that
some members of the Senate may still find
objections and that tbe forecasts so far
published alleging too sweeping "conces
sions" on the part of Great Britain may
have a deleterious effect. For instance,
the deduction that the proposed treaty in
any way reaffirms or extends the scope
of the Monroe doctrine meets with a de
nial by the Foreign Office. For these and
other reasons Lord Pauncefote is not
likely to affix his signature to the docu
ment until a majority of the Senate shall
have had full opportunity for studying
Great Britain's proposal.
Spirit of Indifference.
In the meanwhile there exists here a
spirit of indifference and a feeling that,
after all, the new treaty may be pigeon
holed on account of some unexpected Sen
atorial objection, though this development
would create the keenest disappointment
despite its present stoical anticipation.
From a diplomatic source there has lately
emanated private rumors that the Suez
Canal Company is using financial and

a Book?
?I will mall you any book from tie list
below if you send me your address.
With it I will send an order, en your
nearest druggist for six bottles of Dr.
Shocp's Restorative. If you think that
you need it after reading the book, y ou
are welcome to take it a month at my
risk. If it cures, pay your druggist $5.50.
If it falls, I will pay him myself.
This remarkable offer is made after a
lifetime's experience. I have learned how
to strengthen the inside nervesâ those-
nerves that alone operate every vital
organ. I make each organ do its duty by
bringing back its nerve power. No case is
too difficult. I take the risk in all.
In rive years 550,000 people have accepted
this offer, and 39 in each 40 paid. They
paid because they were cure<i. for no
druggist accepts a penny otherwise. TÂ»c
decision is left with you.
Note that if my Restorative cures, tho
cost is a trifle. If It fails, it is free. Can
you neglect such an offer when 33 out or
40 who write me are cured?

Mild cases, not chronic, are often cured
by one or two bottles. At all durggists'
other influence to prevent an agrt^
being reached in regard to the Nicaragua
canal. It has been further reported tnut
this powerful corporation has joined hands
with several leading American interests
alleged to be opposed to the constr:
of this latter waterway. The head
of the British state departments admitted
that the Nicaragua canal would probably
rob the Suez canal of all its far Ea
trade. The British Government is the
largest stockholder ln the Suez canal, but
it dees not appear that financial interest
ever entered into the discussions of thd
Nicaragua canal, the considerations In
volved therein being regarded as so para
mount to any possible loss of future divi
dends from the Suez Canal Company a*
to be unworthy of being coupled with thÂ»
subject The actual business of the Sues
Canal Company is all transacted in Paris,
where the secretary general of the com
pany said to a corrsepondent:
'For us the Panama and Nicaragua:!
projects do not exist. We pay absolutely
no attention to them. We have never ex
ercised any influence to prevent either of
those schemes from jeing carried out, anil
we shall never do so. We can look for
ward to the eventful opening of either
canal with perfect equanimity, as we do
not anticipate any appreciable loss of In
come from their competition. We may
even benefit by the general developmen:
of the traffic that the opening of a canal
across the American isthmus may cause. '
The Panama Canal Company is also i'i-m
norant of any action having been takeiqf
by the Suez Canal Company against thÂ«
proposed Nicaragua canal.
It is interesting to note that several
English interviews all declare that Eng
lish trade with the Far East must torn
found to take the isthmian route, not
only to expedite cargoes, but to avoid pal
pable danger of the 3uez route which vow
compels them to skirt the shores of three
nations, France, Spain and Italy, who "by
the fall of the handkerchief" might be
come hostile. These authorities assumed,
without any reservation, that war be
tween Great Britain and the United States
is an impossibility.
Nicaragua Terminates Treaty.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â The Govern
ment of Nicaragua has terminated thÂ«
treaty under which the United States waÂ»
empowered to construct an interoceansc
canal across the territory of Nicaragua.
This action has been conveyed to-thÂ»
State Department by the Nicaxaguaa
Minister for Foreign Affairs. That otf.Li-u
declares that the denunciation in no wise
affects the friendly relations between th-j
two countries and the Nicaraguan G >â¢-
ernment desires the conclusion of new
treaties.
Between the treaty of riendahip, com
merce and navigation of 1867 thus re

the convention will expire October 24, 1908,
which is one year from the date r>n which
the notice was received at the State De
partment. The extradition treaty ter
minates May 24 next, as provided in thÂ«*
convention.
The Nicaraguan Minister's note conveys
absolutely no inforrration as to the mo
tives which inspired the Nicaraguan Gov
ernment to renounce these two treaties,
nor haa Mr. Mtrry, United States Minis
ter to Nicaragua, thrown any light on tho
subject. It may be recalled, as affecting
the treaty of 1^67. that before submitting
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty to Congres*
last year Secretary Hay drew up a set of
protocols with the Minister for Nicaragua
and the Minister for Colombia, whereby
these officers bound their Governments to
negotiate treaties with the Unite J State*
for the necessary concessions to construe;
and control canals In the event that Con
gress should authorize the beglnnins; o*

AT CRITICISM
Publication of a French
General's Letters
Ignored.
Charges Against Yon Walder
see Will Not Provoke
Trouble.
BERLIN, Nov. 2.â The publication in
.his week of the letters written by
General Voyron, who commanded th~
French troops in China, to Field Marshal
Count yon Waldersee. showing among
other things that the relations between
Â«=-nch general and the field marshal
were strained during the entire period of
the foreign occupation, caused little ex
citement here.
A Government official who was inter-
I en the subject said that absolute
ly ro occasion exists for Germany to take
official notice of the affair, adding that
the Matin, which published the letters.
vat not an official organ. The French
Government would evade any diplomatic
rep -esent&tlons by disclaiming any con
nection with -he Matin. Furthermore, the
expectation expressed in Paris tbat the
Incident will cause the publication of the
field marshal's letters will not be realized.
Tae Kreuz Zeitung to-day admits the
BkiU and politeness with which General
Voyron sought to secure the greatest pos
sible degree of independence of the rieid
marshal for the French commanders and
B*l\ s that hence Yon Waldersee deserved
6.1. the greater praise for discharging blBb 18
difficult ia6k.
The National Zeitung sarcastically ad
mits that the Matin proves General Voy
ror's diplomatic talent by the publication
of the letters.
Yon Waldersee Was Courteous.
The Berlin, :\"eueste Nachrichten dis
cus.ses the letters and the several issue*
in\olved and assumes that their publica
tion was an unfriendly act against th?
field marshal, otherwise the matter is
Incomprehensible, since Yon Waldersee
treated the French with exceptional cour
tesy. Referring to the Chauvinistic
French newspaper comment on the letterr
thÂ« Berlin Neueste Nachrichten con
cludes:
T.ie more the French papers discuss the
ir.auer. the more deeply we are impressed with
the fact that the temporary cessation of
Chauvinistic demonstrations in France is due
rat ier to tactical consideration than to a con
dition In the political sentiments of the nation.
At soon ac the general situation warrants
French hope of success in a new reckoning
with Germany the old hatred will break forth
â¢with its lull force. The French remain the
arch Â«nemies of our people. We Germans
must never forget this in time* of peace and
polite phrases.
"he Vossische Zeitung says: "It re
quired great self-control to maintain cool
blcod over the letters, and a magnanimous
spirit was shown thereafter in giving tht
French general. Bojal. a warm reception
in Berlin at the end of May."
The Vosslschc Zeitung further quote
Emperor William's expression to General
Bogal about the Germans and French
fighting a common foe in good comrade
ship, adding that this comradeship is ii
lusory. In conclusion the Vossische
Zeitung says: "The conduct of General
Voyron and his malicious patrons is un
worthy of a nation claiming to chival
rous."
The Tageblatt regards the letter? qs
proving that the French Government,
Â¦while officially recognizing Field Marshal
yen Waldersee'p commandership in chief
instructed General Voyron to do his ut
to make the same illusory, adding:
"It waf a policy of pin pricks, whpro
eojrage to express the meaning openly
we.s lacking."
Chamberlain Not Noticed.
The speech of the British Colonial Sec
retary. Mr. Chamberlain, at Edinburgh.
October 2Â£. in which he said the British
wculd find precedents for anything they
do in South Africa, brought forth in the
pr<>ss here an emphatic and rather bitter
repudiation of the charges made against
the German conduct of the war of 1&71
Official circle* say the German Govern
ment does not intend to notice Chamber
la!-,'s utterances. Lord Salisbury having
repeatedly disclaimed responsibility for
the colonial minister's expressions out
side of Parliament.
The return of the German troops from
China, with the exception of the perma
nent garrison, has been completed.
A naval expert in the National Zeitung
discusses PresiSent Roosevelt's naval
programme and asserts that it is im
possible to carry it out. pince the Ameri
can ship yards are unable to build so
many vessels simultaneously.
The newspapers are devoting much at
tertion to New York's Mayoralty contest.
The Vossische Zeitung describes the spe
cial corruption In New York as "hor
rible." and the New York correspondent
of the Kreuz Zeitung says:
"If Low tries to fill the offices with
Bt men he will fail, since there are
rot enough honest men in New York."

"IN OLD KENTUCKY"
AWAKENS OAKLANDâADA
REHAN IS COMING.
OAKLAND is trying to be good.
Oakland hain't always been
good. Indeed, Oakland has had
In the past an almost spotless
reputation, as the fascinating
widow in "Henrietta" puts itâ
"all black and not a white spot in it"â
with most of the theatrical companies
that have wandered into its wilds. But a
famine descended upon the land, the onÂ©
first class theater of the town has been
closed for almost a year and Oakland is
repentant Oakland is more than repent
ant, reduced, in fact, to lively humility,
and C. P. Hall has chosen the psycholog
ical moment to reopen the Macdonough
Theater, which he did on Halloween with
"In Old Kentucky." All the town was
there and every seat was filled. If Mr.
Hall succeeds in carrying out his plans it
Is more than likely that our charming
neighbors across the bay will continue to
patronize the home theater and regain
Its lost position in the managerial heart.
Associated with C. P. Kail, the lessee of
the theater, are L. Henry and Robert
Barton, who have control of the San Jose,
Stockton, Santa Barbara and Fresno the
aters, and Guy C. Smith, long connected
with the fortunes of the Macdonough.
The policy of the theater, as outlined by
Mr. Smith, will include the keeping open
of the. house from 2 to 5 nights weekly
with as good attractions as can be had
End at a collapsible scale of prices.
Certainly the most captious critic could
hardly demand more for his money than
the initial offering of the t new manage
ment. "In Old Kentucky" is one of the
firiest of the mint julep dramas, and of all
the things that could, would or should
happen in the Bluegrass State, not one 's
left out of the bill. There is a horse race,
a couple of murders, a fire, a whisky still
raid, a dialect that cheers, a darkey band,
a much darker villain, a star rooster,
three bonny horses, a dynamite explosion
and a shot a minute among the leading
features of the drama, and the audience
took it all in with a lavish enthusiasm
born of long famine. The smell of battle
incited the gallery to deeds of daring-do
and It outhissed, outwbistled and out
stamped Morosco's in its palmiest mo
ments. Altogether, the opening of the
Macdonough Theater must be regarded as
a huge success.
We get "In Old Kentucky" to-night at
the California, and it should be said in
addition to the attractions catalogued
above that it has some of the' cleverest
buck and wing dancing that is done; a
rather charming little heroine, Alice Treat
Hunt, and that the gyrations of Wood
lawn Whangdoodles, the clever pickanin
nies that play in the good band, are odd
and amusing. â¢â¢ Â¦ Â¦

Since Daly's death Miss Rehan has done

left the stage entirely for two years, and
since then has done but little. "Sweet

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1901.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
JOHN D. SPRECKELS, Proprietor. Address Communications to W. S. LEAKE, Manager
Publication Office <3*a|g|a^j|> Market and Third, S. F.
ON Friday night, Mr. Wells, you made some more speeches. You spoke out in the Rich
mond district. The questions asked of you were in the night air. Why did you say
you would not have run if you had known the kind of Supervisor ticket that would be
nominated with you? Why did you say you would go off the ticket if Flint didn't go on?
These and other burning questions followed you to Richmond Hall, and how did you an
swer them?
Here is your answer j Mr. Wells: "A few years ago I had no idea that I would be able to
address a meeting at this place. At that time it was rolling sand. A great many people thought
that sand never could be controlled. But they found that sand can be controlled."
Now, Mr. Wells, that was not g categorical answer, but was it an allegorical answer? No
one cares whether years ago you foresaw that you could make a speech in that district, for you
can't make a speech anywhere. But speaking of sand and its control, you showed "sand" once,
and people thought it could not be controlled. That was when you told the Bulletin: "As head
of this ticket I have some rights, and they must be respected. If Flint is not put on the ticket, I
go off." That was good sand, but alas! like that of the Richmond district it was controlled. You
surrendered your rights, gave up Flint and did not go off the ticket! The Richmond sands are
kin to your sand, Mr. Wells â they have both been controlled. But the people want to know who
controlled your sand. That is the issue you raised yourself when you showed sand. You cannot
evade the question by turning public attention to the sands of Richmond.
The same night you spoke in If ayes Valley. The people still wanted to know who con
trolled your sand, But you said: "I am glad to greet you as Republicans. I have been so, many
years longer than most of you have been on earth."
Nobody has denied your patriarchal age, Mr. Wells. You showed it in the next sentence
of your .speech when you said: "The Mayor must have good Supervisors, and they are the legis
lators of the city. If those on the Republican ticket should be elected yon will have a good gov
ernment. I do not think it necessary to touch on the issues."
That shows that your sand is under better control than the sand of Richmond. You said
in the beginning that the Supervisors on your ticket were so bad that you would have refused to
run with them had they been nominated first. You demanded that Flint go upon the ticket in
order to have one man on the board upon whom you could depend. And now you say if those
same Supervisors are elected we will have good government! We fear, Mr. Wells, that your sand
is not merely under control, but that it has run out of your political gizzard entirely.
The same evening you said to a German club that you had formulated your policy, and it
would be published for everybody to read. But, Mr. Wells, you have done that before. You
formulated your policy in an ultimatum that did you great credit when you said, "Either Flint
goes on the ticket or Igo off." The people read that and liked it. But you did not stick to it.
You did not do as your formulated policy said you would. So what is the use of formulating an
other policy, when your sand is under control? Who knows that you will stick to it any better
than you did to your other ultimatum? Your sand then was no better than sawdust.
Mr. Wells, take our advice, answer those questions or quit. Do as your first policy re
quired, and get off the ticket. Don't wait to be put off next Tuesday, but get off now, and fall
back on your O. P. S., your various "vicinities," and your large house up the avenue.
THE DATE IN CALIFORNIA.
THE date palm grows all over California. Along the sidewalks in our towns where people
throw date seeds the plants spring up, and the tree is among our most valued palms on
lawns and avenues. Only at a few places, however, does it ripen its fruit. The Wolfskill
grove, in Yolo County, produces edible dates, and so do trees in Oroville. But in no case
has there been any demonstration of the commercial value r>nd importance of the dried date. Now,
however, there seems a prospect that the date may become of commercial importance in this
State and be added to our export fruits.
Mr. Walter T. Swingle, a gentleman who is likely to rank with Burbank as a benefactor of
the agriculture and horticulture of the United Stated, has been making a specialty of the intro
duction of the date. He is one of the explorers employed by the section of seed and plant intro
duction of the Agricultural Department at Washington, and has already had much to do with the
introduction of the blastophaga, the minute insect that pollinates the Smyrna fig, and has now in
hand the introduction of the large variety of the pistachio nut, which by reason of its late bloom
promises to add an important feature to our nut production. This pistachio is eaten like the
almond, and has not the fault of precocity which causes the almond bloom to be caught by spring
frosts in many parts of the State. He is' also interested in domesticating here the truffle oak,
Quercus ilex, under which the finest truffles grow. But his most important work is with the date.
The Agricultural Department has lately issued his illustrated report on "The Date Palm
and Its Culture," which is of literary, scientific and practical interest to Californians. All date
eaters will read it with profound pleasure, and all rural economists who desire to see the great
capacities of California all in action will hail it as a promise of great things.
The date is one of the oldest cultivated plants, but many will learn for the first time from
Mr. Swingle's admirable paper that there are dates and dates, the varieties being as distinct as the
different varieties of apples, peaches or grapes. Mr. Swingle says that of the three principal types
of dafes cultivated by the Arabs only one is exported to Europe and the United States. This is
called by the Arabs the soft date, 60 per cent of its weight being sugar, and the fruit being so full
of sweet syrup that it has to drain off before shipment. The second type has a less percentage of
sugar, does not dry readily, and is, therefore, usually eaten fresh from the tree. The third are
called dry dates, unknown outside of Arabia, but highly esteemed by the Arabs. They are not soft
when ripe, and keep for years in dry storage. This type will never be popular here. Each of these
general types has several varieties. The Wolfskill dates on Colonel Sam Taylor's place at Win
ters are of the second type, delicious as a fresh fruit, and Mr. Swingle says that several varieties of
this type may flourish in Northern California. But the Rahrs, Tedella and other sugary sorts
require great heat and dryness of air with copious irrigation. The Amreeyeh and Seewah have
borne near Phoenix, Arizona, 300 and 400 pounds of fruit, which sold readily for 40 cents a
pound. But Mr. Swingle regards the Deglet Noor, or "date of the light," as the king o.f the
dates. It is of medium size, translucent, with soft flesh of most exquisite flavor. But few of these
dates reach the United States, because they are so eagerly sought in Europe. These are only a
few of the thousands of varieties of this ancient fruit whose cultivation began in the valley of the
Euphrates by a race long extinct.
Mr. Swingle made the camel back journey to an oasis in the Sahara where the Deglet
Noor is cultivated, and succeeded in exporting a large number of the trees. They were wrapped,
loaded on camels on May 19, 1900, and began the long journey across the African desert to
Biskra, where they were freighted by rail to Algiers, whence they were shipped to New York, arriv
ing July 3. The Southern Pacific Railway gave them free transportation to Arizona, where they
were planted near Tempe on July 25, 1900, just two months and six days after they left the casis
in Chott Melrirh. It is remarkable that in the following October 93 per tent of the trees were
alive and that over 70 per cent are now growing.
Mr. Swingle made a complete study of temperature and climatic conditions necessary for
the growth of these dates, and finds these exactly reproduced on the Colorado Desert in this State.
He says that California has two great regions where dates will become of commercial im
portance, one being the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys, the other the Colorado Desert.
He says that with the exception of one tree at ' Nice, in France, in latitude 43 north, the Wolf
skill palms at Winters, latitude 38 north, are the northernmost date palms in the world that ripen
their fruit, but the same variety will ripen much farther north, as proved by his stu:dy of the
climate and temperature at Orland, Corning, Vina, Tehama, Red Bluff and even Redding, in lati
tude 40. He also gives a list of the varieties that will be suitable for all this region.
But the Deglet Noor may cover a thousand square miles in the Colorado Desert, where
the temperatures are as high as on the Sahara. Using the water of the Colorado River for irri
gation, that desolate region may be made to produce the finest dates in the world, and add a large
value to the fruit export of California. We advise Californians to get Mr. Swingle's report, and we
promise that they will not lay it down until it is read through, and that they will turn to it again
and again. Its author is now in this city, at the California Hotel, where he is arranging for the in
troduction of new forage plants and other things of value to the State.
It is stated that the woman who went over Niagara in a barrel has received a half dozen""
offers of marriage, so any woman who wishes to get a husband has only to follow her example.
AH! MR,. "VSTEIjXjS.
MUSICAL RECITALS
FOR CITY'S POOR ARE
SADLY WANTING.
Blanche Partington
HERE Is what ""W. M." thinks of
the musical situation in San
Francisco. As he says much that
is in need of saying, I give his
letterâ too long held over for lack
of space â in its entirety:
"Will you kindly use your influence toward the
organization of a series of weekly popular con
certs this coming winter in San Francisco? By
"concerts" I mean instrumental recitals of all
accepted kinds, choral or oratorio perform
ances, as well as vocal recitals. But In par
ticular the real need I should like to emphasize
is that of high-class music at popular prices.
I Know the disheartening and pessimistic re
ply that nine out of every ten people give when
the above subject Is broached: that It has been
tried and found a failure, that no one will go
to such concerts at 10, 13 and 25 cents (the
prices for admission at existing popular re- j
sorts). ' May I ask when the last experiment
was made upon which these objections are
based? I have been In the city five years and
have kept an eye on the advertising; columns,
but have failed to hear of any concerts other
.than the exclusive and fashionable social func
tion, the price and very often the hour of
which are evidently fixed with the Intention of
keeping the "hoi polloi" out of range.
Surely the immense and orderly audiences
that attended several days In succession at the
Mechanics' Institute to hear the free recitals
on the Stanford organ rebut the contention that !
the "people" of San Francisco are non-musical I
and unappredatlva of such . possibilities as [
those recitals afforded for the lover of sweet I
sounds. Again, it Is Inconceivable In a
city where so many thousands of the Inhabit
ants are from Eastern cities or European coun
tries, where popular music is almost part of ;
the air they breathe, that It can be said truly
there Is no demand for the cheap evening con- ;
cert, an essential and most precious element ;
among the legitimate recreations of a great Â¦
city. That San Francisco, with its 400,000 popu
lation, is without a municipal art gallery may '
not be a reproach, but that there is no place :
in the remotest degree resembling a music hall
seems to me to Indicate a strange hiatus In the
catalogue of local attractions.
Where are our public-spirited and wealthy
citizens? It does not take a musical enthusiast
to appreciate the high moral and I intellectual
value of good music given under appropriate |
auspices and brought easily within the means j
of the masses. Any one who has seen any- j
thing of the world in its holiday and leisure I
moments cannot Â¦ but desire (If he has any In- \
terest at all In the community's welfare) tha j
raising of the average standard of recreation
(so-called). It Is unnecessary to specify; in San j
Francisco . the places and resorts are only too
numerous and prominent where our youth and
country cousins are Invited Into drinking dens
or dives with . apparently no attempt mads by
others than the exploiters of the frail side of
humanity to provide satisfaction to the natural
Instincts of the toller seeking ' needed change
after a bard day's labor.
. Where . are our churchmen and philanthro
pists in this matter? Even If the wealthy, who
are provided with their own forms of amuse
ment, stand aloof, I am sure the musical cir
cles of the city, co-operating with the churches,
could, if . they would, set about directing pub
lic and civic sentiment toward the establish
ment not only of a grand central music hall,
with halls for chamber concerts and choral fes
tivals on occasion, but also of smaller halls In
crowded districts for * weekly musical â¢ enter
tainments. Branch libraries are all very well
but reading does not always flll the void, and I
maintain that the feelings and emotions need
at least as careful attention and cultivation as
the Intellect. â¢-
If funds at first came In slowly volunteer ef
fort could be called for and would no doubt be
forthcoming.
In fact, there must be many. local amateurs
who would regard It as a pleasure and privilege
to devote an evening occasionally toward a pub
lic entertainment, without fee being desired
On the whole, perhaps it would be wiser to
begin In this way.. with a weekly concert in
some central hall such as the Metropolitan on
Saturday or Sunday night preferably That
such a series. if conducted by an able and en
ergetic'committee, would form the nucleus of
a , beneficcft and prosperous civic Institution Is

kind, and one of tha most notable, was

last spring by the Twentieth Century Oub

were under the direction of Professor
Hermann Genss, who provided a high
class popular programme at prices from
50 cents down to 15 cents. The first con
cert, for -which 5000 free tickets were dis
tributed, was crowded. Coupons admitting
to the second concert on payment of 15
cents were distributed at the first con
cert, but only seventy-five of these were
turned in. The cost of these concerts to V
the Twentieth Century Club was from |73
to $105. including everything from talent
to printing. There were five In the series
all told. None of the concerts "paid."
The third was so sparsely attended that
the Metropolitan Hall was given up. Tha
remaining entertainments took place In a
smaller hall.
Now these concerts were well adver
tised, they were high In tone, yet not

made their appeal, they were popular In

THANKSGIVING
PROCLAMATION
President Appoints Day
to Render Praise to
the Almighty.
Refers to Nation's Sad Loss
and the Keen Anxiety of
the People.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.-President
Roosevelt to-day issued his proclamation
fixing Thursday, November 28, aa a day
of national thanksgiving. It follows:
A PROCLAMATION.
The season is nigh when, according to the
time-hallowed custom of our people, the Presi
dent appoints a day as the especial occasion for
praise and thanksgiving to <3<>d. This Thanks
giving finds the people still bowed with sorrow
for the death of a great and good President.
We mourn President McKinley because we so
loved and honored him, and the manner of his
death should awaken In the breasts of our
people a keen anxiety for the country and at
the same time a resolute purpose not to be
driven by any calamity from the path of strong,
orderly, popular liberty which, as a nation,
we have thus far safely trod.
Yet in spite of this great disaster it is never
theless true that no people on earth have such
abundant cause for thanksgiving as we have.
The past ytar in particular has been one of
peace and plenty. We have prospered in things
material and have been able to work for our
own uplifting in things intellectual and spir
itual. LÂ«t us remember that as much has been
given us much will be expected from us, and
that true homage comes from the heart as
well as from the lips and shows Itself In
deeds. We can best prove our thankfulness to
the Almighty by the way in which on this
earth and at this time each of us does his duty
to his fellow men.
Now. therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt. Presi
dent of the United States, do hereby designate
as a day of general thankbglving Thursday,
the 28th day of this present November, and do
recommend that throughout the land the people
cease from thmir wonted occupations and at
their several homes and places of worship
thank the giver of all good for the countless
blessings of our national life.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my
hand and caused the Â»eal of the United States
to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington this second
day of November, In the year of our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and one, and of the in
dependence of the United States the one hun
dred and twenty-sixth.

PETITIONS IX INSOLVENCY.â Petitions In
Insolvency were filed yesterday In the United
States District Court as follows: Charles H.
Osborn, clerk in the office of the United States

HAIR NATURALLY ABUNDANT.
"When It Is Free of Dandruff It
Grows Luxuriantly.
Hair preparations and dandruff cures,
as a rule, are sticky or irritating affairs
that do no earthly good. Hair, when not
diseased, grows naturally, luxuriantly.
Dandruff is the cause of nine-tenths of all
hair trouble, and dandruff is caused by
a germ. The only way to cure dandruff
is to kill the germ; and, so far, the only
hair preparation that will positively de-
stroy the germ is Newbro's Herpicide â
absolutely harmless, free from grease,
sediment, dye matter or dangerous i drugs.
It allays itching instantly; makes hair
glossy and soft as silk. "Destroy the
cause, you remove the effect." â dandruff.

We confidently ask the support

City Government is business,

insure honest service. Our nom-
inees are true and tried men.
Support them in your own in-

Soon to Depart for Manila
to Relieve Short
Term Men.
Commissioner Wright Is Ap
pointed Vice Governor of
the Philippines.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.-Lieutenant
General Miles has adopted the following
arrangements for sending troops to the
Philippines to replace the four regiments
of short term men which are to be
brought home within the next few
months:
Two battalions of the Twenty-eighth In
fantry, to sail from San Francisco on the
Grant on the 15th inst. ; one battalion of
the Twenty-eighth Infantry, to sail from
San Francisco on the Warren December
1; a squadron of the Eleventh Cavalry,
to sail from San Francisco about Decem
ber 15, on a transport not yet selected; a
squadron of the Eleventh Cavalry, sta
tioned at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, to
sail from New York on the Crook about
December 1; a squadron of the Eleventh
Cavalry, stationed at Fort Myer, Virginia,
to sail from New York on the Buford Jan
uary 15.
In addition to the troops named, it is
proposed also to send a large number of
recruits for the purpose of filling the
quotas of depleted regiments in the Phil
ippines. The Eleventh Cavalry and the
Twenty-eighth Infantry aggregate about
2400 men, and the present plan is to send
out with them about the same number of
recruits, thus providing nearly 5000 fresh
soldiers for the relief of those coming
home.
Secretary Root 'to-day received a cable
message from Governor Taft at Manila,
saying he had been successfully operated
on for a minor trouble and expected to be
all right again in about two weeks. It
was announced at the War Department
that Governor Taft's condition will not
necessitate his return to this country.
Hon. Luke E. Wright, the senior mem
ber of the Philippine Commission after
Governor Taft, has been appointed Vice
Governor of the islands, in order to meet
just such an emergency as has arisen
through the present indisposition of the
Governor. His tenure is explained in the
following order, signed by the President
and dated November 1:
"Hon. Luke E. Wright is appointed
Vice Governor with authority to act as
Civil Governor of the Philippine Islands
whenever the Civil Governor is incapaci
tated by illness or certifies that his tem
porary absence from the seat of govern
ment will make it necessary for the Vice
Governor to exercise such powers and du
ties. THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
Father Crowley's Suit.
CHICAGO, Nov. 2.â Rev. Jeremiah J.
Crowley to-day entered suit in the Su
preme Court for $50,000 against the Rev.
Francis J. Barry, chancellor of the Catho
lic archdiocese of Chicago. The suit is
the outgrowth of Father Crowley's recent
excommunication and expulsion from the
church, following charges which he made
against Father Muldoon, then about to be
consecrated as a Bishop.
Burglars Blow Vault Open.
DES MOINES, la., Nov. 2.â The bank of
J. C. Currier & Sons at Salix, la., was
entered by burglars last night and the
vault blown open. Four explosions were
heard, awakening a man rooming near
by. The robbers disappeared as he came
on the scene and failed to secure any
booty.

SAY CZOLGOSZ
IS NOT INSANE
Physicians Make Public
the Report of Their
Examinations. .
Declare That the Assassin
Was the Product of
Anarchy.
BUFFALO, Nov. 2.â Doctors Fowler,
Crego and Putnam, the scientists who
were requested by District Attorney
Penny to examine into the mental condi
tion of Leon F. Czolgosz, the assassin of
President McKinley, have made public
their report, in which they state as the
result of examination and from the re
ports of his watches and his behavior in
court, that he was sane at the time he
planned the murder when he shot the
President and when he was on trial.
His first examination was but a few
hours after the commission of the crime
ana while he was still uninformed of the
fate of his victim. During the first three
examinations Czolgr3Z answered ques
tions unhesitatingly. After that, how
ever, he became more cautious and less
communicative. He had a common school
education, the reports sÂ»y, and read and
wrote well, During the first day's ex
amination he said he planned killing the
President three or four d v ays after he
came to Buffalo. The report then re
calls in Czolgosz's own words, the as
sassin's account of the murder of Presi
dent McKinley. The sanity of the pris
oner was told:
From the history of his life as It came from
him. He had been sober, Industrious and law
abiding until he was 21 years of age; he was,
as others of his class, a believer .in the Govern
ment of this country and of the religion of his
fathers. After he cast his first vote he made
the acquaintance of anarchistic leaders who in
vited him to their meetings. He was a good
listener, and in a short time he adopted their
theories. He was consistent in his adherence
to anarchy. He did not believe in the Govern
ment, therefor he refused to vote. He did not
believe in marriage, because he did not belit-vt
in law. He killed the President because he
was a ruler, and Czolgosz believed as he was
taught that all rulers were tyrants, and that
to kill a ruler would benefit the people. He re
fused a lawyer because he did not believe in
law, lawyers or courts.
"We come to the conclusion that in the hold
ing of these views Czolgosz was sane, because
these opinions were formed gradually under
the influence of anarchistic leaders and pro
pagandists. In Czolgosz they found a willing
and intelligent tool, one who had the courage
of his convictions, regardless of personal con
sequences. The most careful questioning failed
to discover any hallucinations of sight or hear
ing. He had received no special command; he
did not believe he had been especially chosen to
do the deed. He always spoke of his motive for
the crime as duty; he always referred to the
anarchists' belief that the killing of rulers was
a duty. He never claimed the idea of killing
the President was original with him, but the
method of accomplishing his purpose was liis
and that he did it alone. He was not a case
of paranera because he did not have systema
tized delusions reverting to self, and because
he was in exceptionally good condition and had
an unbroken record of good health. His capa
city for labor had always been good and equal
to that of his fellows. These facts all tend to
prove that the man had an unimpaired mind.
He had false beliefs, the result of false teach
ing and not the result of disease. He was nut
to be classed Â«as a degenerate, because we did
not find the stigmata of degeneration. Physi
cally he did not have a history of cruelty or of
perverted tastes and habits. He was the pro
duct of anarchy, sane and responsible.
INGENIOUS DEVICE
CATCHES A THIEF
Henry Sfavary Is Discovered in the
Aft of Robbing a Poor
Box.
The poor box at the Tolesia de Nuestra
Senora de Guadalupe Church on Broad
way, between Mason and Taylor streets,
had been so often robbed that recently the
rector. Rev. Father Santandreu, had it
attached to the floor by a chain and con
nected a wire between it and his study,
so that if any one lifted it from the floor
the bell would ring.
Yesterday afternoon about 2 o'clock the
bell rang and Father Santandrgu hurried
into the church. A man was there, and
in trying to run away had stumbled and
fallen on the floor. He was detained by
the rector till a messenger brought Spe
cial Officer O. H. Berge to the scene. The
officer took the man to the City Prison,
where he said his name was Henry Sav
ary, â¢ a cook by occupation. He denied
touching the poor box and said it must
have been done by a man he saw leaving
the church.
The rector called at the prison later and
preferred a charge of attempt to commit
petty larceny against Savary.
Mrs. Ladewig Wants New Trial.
Adrienne B. Ladewig, whose huSband,
Arthur E. Dadewig, a prominent young
real estate man, secured a divorce from
her a month ago, is not satisfied with the
judgment rendered by Judge Seawell and
will move for a new trial of the suit.
When the divorce was granted Judge Sea
well ordered Ladewig to pay to Mrs.
Ladewig $25 per month for the support of
their child, the custody of which was
given to the mother. In the affidavit filed
by Mrs. Ladewig yesterday in support of
the notice that a motion for a new trial
would be made she claims that $50 per
month should be allowed and asks for
that sum pendente lite.
Larsen Easily Bunkoed.
Two men went to the cigar store of Os
car L. O. Larsen, 333 Third street, Friday
evening, representing themselves as store
keepers in Port Costa, and purchased $55
worth of cigars. They gave him a check
on the Anglo-Callfornian Bank signed
"Smith & Jones" for the account, dated
October 1, and went away with the cigars.
When Larsen went to the bank yesterday
morning he was told no such people had
an account there and no such firm wa3
known in Port Costa. He secured war
rants from Judge Cabanies yesterday for
the arrest of "John Doe" and "Richard
Roe" on a charge of obtaining property
by false pretenses. Â»
Tabor Was Held Up.
William A. Tabor, commissary sergeant
on the transport Grant, was held up by
three young men shortly after 2 o'clock
yesterday morning in front of Martin's
saloon, 833 Howard street. Tabor shouted
for help and Martin and some men who
were drinking at the bar ran outside and
the young robbers bolted without getting
any booty. Tabor had be,en drinking, but
he was able to describe one of the robbers
as 5 feet 9 inches tall, of slim build, about
19 years of age, which answers the de
scription of a youth who has figured in
more than one hold-up in the same lo
cality.

TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY
Delightful Function Given by a Sub
ordinate of the Native
Sons.
Pacific Parlor No. 10, Native Sons of the
Golden West, was 20 years old last Friday,
and it celebrated that event by a ball in
Native Sons' Hall. This subordinate, one
of the most important of the Native Sons'
organization, gave this function in keep
ing with its well known reputation for
managing social affairs within the rules
that govern society. The decoration of
the dance hall was in the parlor's colors,
gold and white, emblematic of the wealth
of the State and the purity of motives
that govern the membership, while the
stage was a bank of white and deÂ«p yel
low roses, resting on palms and ferns,
from the upper framework to the foot
lights. It was an evening dress affair, ao
there were many exquisite costumes on
the floor worn by many of San Fran
cisco's fairest native daughters. The first
number on the dance programme was a
waltz to enchanting music from the
orchestra, concealed behind the floral
sta-ge curtain. Then there were eleven
other regular numbers and three extras.
Assistant United States District Attor

Captain Newtk was in no humor
to tslk when the vessel came to an an
chor. Hitherto the Jeanette has come
borne laden with bone, but on this cruise
just ended she did not take a single
whale, and whatever cargo she brings
home is all the result of trade. Last year
the crew had a big pay day. This year
they will receive just $1 each.
Atl that the Jeanette brought into port
was liaw pounds of whaiebone, five pack

this last season Captain McKenna did
very well at trading, so his vessel is really
not a? badly off as It looks on paper. The
others reported "clean' will not pa # ex
penses: â¢ â¢ â¢ -
"On October 4 I spoke the Beluga with
sever, and one-half whales, the Narwhal
with seven and the Bowhead with eight.
On October 12 I spoke the Alexander with
two whales and the Belvedere w.th twelve
Hitherto the best catches have always
been to the eastward of Point Barrow.
This year not a whale was sighted in that
.part of the ocean. The vessels that went
to the eastward came back empty, while
these that remained nearer home or win
tered o:t tile McKenzie did fairly well.
"The Alexander and Belvedere left In
dian Point for San Francisco four hours
ahead of my vessel and â¢ should be
along soon. On October 5 we had a
heavy northeasterly gale, which drove
near'V the entire fleet out of the Arctic.
It lasted five days and some of the ves
sels had a hard time of it. Again on Oc
tober 24 we ran into a west-northwest
storm, which lasted four days and sent
us kitlr.g home. All in all, it has bean the
poorest trip I have made in years and I
never want another one like it. We were
among. the first to make Nome last sea
eon and found things in pretty bad shape
there. There has not been much improve
ment and many will die there- this winter
if the Government does not bring the pen
nilPfs to civilization.
"There were two deaths during the voy
age. Joseph Spindle, the steward, was
taken sick during the early part of the
voyage and died. One of the 'green hands'
took pneumonia In Bering Sea and he also
died. Those were the only deaths we had
during the voyage."

GRAPE-NUTS.
TAKE THEM OUT.
Or Feed Them, on Food They Can
Study On.
When a student be^inf to break down
from lack of the right kind of food, there
are only two things to doâ either take
him cut of school or feed him properly on
food that will rebuild the brain and nerve
cells. That food is Grane-N'ut?.
A boy writes from Jamesfv, \ N. V.,
eaying: "A short time ago I get Into a
bad condition from overstudy, but Moth-
er, having heard about Grape-Xutr, Food
began to fee<i me oa it. It satisfied my
hunger better than any other food, and
the results were marvelous. I got fleshy
like a good fellow. My usual morning
aches disappeared and I found I
couid study for a long period without
feeling the effects of it.
"After I had been using Grape-Xuts
Food for about two months I felt like a
boy altogether. My face had been
pale and thin, but is now round and has
considerable color. I have gained greatly
in strength as well us flesh, and it is a.
pleasure to study now thrft I am not both-
ered with my head. I passed all of my
examinations with a reasonably good per-
centage, extra good in some of them, and
il was Grape-Xuts that saved me from a
: s delay in entering college.
"Father and Moth, r hay* both been im-
proved by the use of Grape-Nuts Food.
. Mother was troubled with sleepless
nights, and got very thin and looked care-
worn. She has gained her normal strength
and looks and sleeps well nights." Don

â¢ Â While not so common, is much more stubborn and far reaching in its effects than the other
varieties. In this form of the disease atmospheric conditions are the exciting cause and con-
trolling power. The cold, bleak winds of winter, that chill the body and penetrate the very
bones seem also to revive the sluggish blood and draw it to the surface, when the poisonous
acids with which it is filled irritate and burn the tender skin and inflame the little glands
and pores, thus checking perspiration and drying out the natural oils, when the skin becomes
parched and dry, cracking and bleeding, and causing the most intense pain and itching.
Tetter is the name sometimes given to this form of Eczema when confined to the arms,
hands and feet. All persons are not ; affected alike ; some suffer but little discomfort at first,
while others in more advanced stages of this terrifying disease endure the most exquisite .
torture. The burning fluid that oozes out through the skin often causes little pustules and
blisters to form, and the watery, sticky discharge dries and hardens into scabs and scales,
which, when rubbed off, leave a raw, tender surface. Itching is one of the chief characteristics
of this tormenting malady, whether it conies in summer time or winter. Rheumatism and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 3. 190 i;
MARIN LANDS
IN LITIGATION
Suit Brought to Nullify
Deed to Valuable
Property.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 2.-A law suit
which will excite considerable interest in
this county was commenced here to-day.
The property Involved is worth over $50.
00 and the names of the parties to the
action are those of the pioneers of tho
county. Sensational charges of fraud an 1
undue influence are made in the com
plaint.
The action is commenced for Robert
Ross Makin by his guardian, William
MacCann of San Francisco, against Anne
S. E. Worn. By the suit it is sought to
have the court declare that Makin owns
a half-interest with the defendant in au
immense tract of land situated in R033
Valley and deeded to Mrs. Worn on tho
18th of last May by her mother, Mrs. Ann
S. Ross, who died at the age of about 80
years a month iater.
In the story told by the complaint
young Makin i 3 the son of a daughter oi
Mrs. Ross. He is about 17 years old.
Upon the death of his mother, a few dayb
following his Mrth, Mrs. Ross assumed
charge of him, caring for, supporting ami
educating him until the day of her death.
Through all these years, he alleges, she
declared him to be her heir, and to every
one she spoke most tenderly of him, and
upon all occasions treated him as a son.
About a year previous to her death,
says the plaintiff, she was taken very ill.
In this illness she was attended by her
daughter, Anne S. E. Worn, the complain
ant's aunt, and her affairs were looked
after by D. E. Perry. The complaint
then says: "On the 24th day of April, 1901,
sajd Ann 8. Ross was a mental imbecile,
under the control and domination of said
Anne S. E. Worn and said D. E. Perry,
and on said day, knowipg the physical
and mental condition of said Ann S. Ross,
took advantage thereof for the purpo&9
of fraudulently depriving plaintiff of his
share of the estate."
The complaint then declares that Mrs.
Ross executed conveyances of all her real
and personal property to the defendant,
but not before, however, she had secured
promises from the defendant to divide the
property, share and share alike, with th a
plaintiff when lie attained the legal age.
Mrs. Ross was one of the oldest resi
dents of the county. At one time she
owned the whole of Ross "Valley as far
as Ross Landing.

SAVES CHILD
FROM A LION
Mother in Trinity County
Displays Great
Heroism.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Nov. 2.-From Trinity Coun
ty comes the story of a woman's heroic
rescue of her child from death between
a mountain lion's claws. The brave
mother exhibited a nerve and self-control
such as few men might display.
In Hay Fork Valley, twenty miles south
of Weavervllle, a man named Farmer and
his wife and little child recently took up
their residence. The place is remote, but
no fear was entertained of wild animals.
On Thursday Mrs. Farmer allowed the
5-year-old child to play about the barn
a hundred yards from the house in the
edge of the woods.
Soon afterward she stepped to the rear
door to look after the baby's safety and
leceived a terrific shock. Near the barn
she saw her baby gazing steadfastly into
the eyes of an immense mountain lion
stretched upon the ground and moving
toward the child by inches. The mother
feared to call her husband, who was in
the road just out of sight, but quickly
resolved upon the child s rescue. She
started slowly toward the lion, fluttering
her apron slightly to attract its attention
from the baby. In this way she moved
by hardly perceptible steps to within
twelve feet of the animal, which crouched
low and moved only it 3 jaws and tail.
Quickly she lifted up the child, which had
never moved its eyes from the lion and
which sank unconscious in her arms. She
retreated backward and dropped ex
hausted on the doorstep just as her hus
band appeared at the door. Farmer
snatched up a gun and shot the panther
dead where it crouched. It measured
ten feet from tip to tip and weighed 200
pounds.
ADVERTISEMENTS,
SEASONABLE HINTS.
Guard Your Health, in Fall and Early
Winter.
A change from warm to cold is always
attended with more danger than from a
cold to a warm temperature, hence the
greater mortality from lung and throat
diseases at this season of the year as
compared with spring.
The best protection against colda la not
so much in extra clothing as in good di-
gestion.
It' the digestion and circulation are good,
colds will be unknown.
Poor digestion causes poor circulation
of the blood,' and when in this condition
severe colds are contracted on the slight-
est provocation.
People who make a regular practice of
taking Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after
meals are free from colds simply because
their digestion is perfect, the heart strong
and regular, and the whole system forti-
fied against disease.
It requires little argument to convince
any one that the best safeguard against
colds, pneumonia and changes of temper-
ature Is a good stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken after
meals are dissolved, and mingling with
the food cause it to be promptly digested
and assimilated: they do this because they
contain nothing but harmless digestive
elements, which digest meat, eggs and
other food even when the stomach itself
is weak and flaccid.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets make people
well and keep them well, and the best
habit you can acquire is to keep daily use
of them at meals to make the digestive
organs strong and vigorous.

DIRE VENGEANCE
Luigi Santanella Pursues
Man Who Stole His
Daughter.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HELENA. Mont., Nov. 2.-In the fruit
less quest of Lulgi Santanella may be
found in real life and in fact all the ma
terials for the most tragic story of love
deceived and vengeance sought ever com
posed in volumes of imaginary romance.
Santanella is an intelligent Italian. For
months he has been roaming through all
the Northwest country in search of young
Pietra Boccacio, whom he will kill on
sight. No Corsican vendetta was ever
more real or intense than the wild long
ing for vengeance which Oils and controls
this man's entire life. He visits the
Italian settlement of every community
he comes to. He asks but the one ques
tion:
"Has Pietra Boccacio been seen here?"
He eagerly scans every countenance to
penetrate any would-be disguise.
Santanella is not insane. A year ago
he was living contentedly, happily, with
his little family in a small settlement in
Cascade County, this State. Into his
paradise of paternal love, fully appre
ciated and returned by his daughter Va
leria, came this young fiend Boccacio.
The girl was but 13 and susceptible, as
young maids usually are. She fell madly
in love with Pietra, He wooed her and
she fled with him.
Crazed with grief, the girl's mother
Elned away and died. On her dead body
antanella swore to pursue Boccacio and
bury his stilletto in the miscreant's blood.
Taking his two-year-old boy with him he
started on hia quest for vengeance.
Since the day he made his vow he has
been faithful to It. He works only enough
to keep body and soul together for him
self and child. With varying clews to
lead and mislead him he pursues his
search. He has visited every town of
importance in the Northwest. The last
place he visited was the Italian colony
in Butte, where again he was foiled.
When these two men come together blood
with flow. The outrag-ed father and hus
band will have vengeance or die in the
attempt to gain it.

petrify on one side, but otherwise were in
a good state of preservation. There was

TRIES TO SLAY
CHINA'S EMPRESS
Assassin Kills Dowager's
With a
Spear.
Wu Ting Fang, Minister to
the United States, Re
called to China.
PEKING. Nov. 2.â While the Empress
Dowager was embarking to cross the
river to-day before entering Honan an
assassin attempted to murder her. and
killed an attendant with a spear before he
was cut down.
The court has left Honan en route for
Peking.
Yesterday the recall of Yu Ting Fang,
the Chinese Minister at Washington, was
decided upon. He will be offered, it is
announced, a subordinate post in the
Foreign Office beneath his abilities, which
it is believed he will decline.
Li Hung Chang's interpreter, Tseng,
adopted son of the Marauis Tseng, is a
prominent candidate for the Washington
mission. He is 'M years old and was edu-
Ciited in England.
Cheng ieye h.as been appointed Min
ister in London. He is 55 years of age and
was formerly interpreter to the Chinese
legations in London and Berlin. He is
progressive.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â The Chinese
Legation is without advices bearing out
the Peking report of the decision to recall
Minister At the same time there is
no disinclination at the legation to accept
the report as true for two reasons. First,'
the omcial dispatch in such matters al
most invariably is a day or two later than
the preps dispatch, as occurred in the case
of tne recall of Minister Yang Vi, Minis
ter Wu's predecessor, and second, the pre
scribed term of three years of Minister '
Wu expired some months ago.
It was stated at the legation to-night
that there were no Peking dispatches
aw.iiting the Minister's return. There
have been rumors for some time that Wu
would be recailed. So fax the gossip from
the Chinese court has mentioned two
names as possible successors. These are
Tseng, Li Hung Chang's interpreter, and
Li Cheng Fang a son of that Viceroy. The
latter is about oO years old.
Cheng Teye, appointed to the Chinese
Embassy at the court of St. James, was
a secretary of the special embassy sent
to Tokio to expiate the assassination of
the Chancellor of the Japanese Legation
at Peking:. Sir Lo Fen Loh, whom he
succeeds, was not thought to have been
slated for the transfer to St. Petersburg.
TOLEDO, 0., Nov. 2.â Chinese Minister
Wu was in this city while en route to Ann
Arbor, Mich., where he spoke Friday
night. Senator Hanna met him at the
station and in the course of a conversa
tion said:
"Wu, you are getting too popular over
here. I hear that your countrymen are
getting jealous and are going to make it !
hot for you."
"Ah, you do not understand our people. ]
We are a queer people," said Wu, and
then adroitly changed the subject. Min
ister Wu passed through this city at 9
o'clock to-night on his return trip to
Washington.
GOEBEL MURDER SUSPECTS
WIKL NOT BE EXTRADITED
Governor Durbin of Indiana Refuses
to Sign the Second Requisi
tion Papers.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 2.âGover
nor Durbin to-night announced his deci
sion refusing to grant the requisition for
the return to Kentucky of ex-Governor
Taylor and Charles W. Finley, who were
indicted by Kentucky courts for com
plicity in the murder of Governor William
Goebel.
Governor Durbin's decision is embodied
in a long letter addressed to Governor
Beckham of Kentucky.
Governor Durbin recites the fact that
this is the second requisition made for tho
return of the fugitives and states that he
must decline to honor the requisition for
the same reason that prompted his prede
cessor, the late Governor Mount, that the
time has not yet arrived when an unpre
judiced and non-partisan hearing of tho
charges agrainst the fugitives can be had
in Kentucky.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1901.
FISK'S SLAYER
JOINS MAJORITY
Edward S. Stokes Passes
Away at the Home
of His Sister.
Career of the Man Who Be
came a Power in Tam
many Politics.
LONDON, Nov. 2.â Edward S. Stokes
died this afternoon at the home of his sis
ter, Mrs. McNutt. Before a severe at
tack, which came while he was traveling
in Canada, Stokes had for some. time been
in failing health. He was very low ten
days ago, but rallied only to sink again.
He began failing last night and his
strengtn slowly ebbed away to the end
tins aiternoon.
Edward S. Stokes jvas for a time, some
thirty years ago, tne most taiked-of man
in America, lac had killed the celebrated
financier, Jim jKisk, Jay Gould's partner,
who hao. been his iriend and patron, anu
kihed him for a woman, tne notorious
Josie Mansfield.
Stokes was of good birth and breeding,
and was a Wall-street cierk when iTisK
met and took a lancy to mm, taking him
in time as a visitor to the Twenty-third
street palace in which he had instaueu tne
Mansneid woman, and where nignt after
night he and his friends held high revel
without count of cost. Stokes became
infatuated with the woman, and she ap
peared at least to be fond of him.
Fisk became aware of the deceit of one
and the treachery of the other. Â¦ He made
war on Stokes and ruined him financially.
Stokes, with the Mansfield woman's as
sistance, retaliated. Both were indicted
at the instance of Fisk for blackmail.
Then came the climax, January 6, 1872.
Stores twice shot and fatally wounded
Fiek, who died the next day. Stokes was
three times tried and finally convicted of
manslaughter in the third degree, and ac
cepting the finding went to prison, ar.il
after serving four years was pardoned in
1877. With the remains of the fortune
that he had made under Fisk's tutelage
he embarked after a time in the saloon
business, and his place, the Hoffman
House, became a famous resort for sports
generally. His business grew enormously,
and in the course of eight or ten years he
was rated among the millionaires of
Gotham. He becanfe a power in Tam
many, but at the same time kept from
public view and avoided notoriety, espe
cially shunning that class of women of
whom the text says "her feet take hold
on hell." As he lay dying, however, came
one Rosamond Langdon Barclay, claim
ing to be his wife.
Stokes lost largely some few years ago
in various speculations, but doubtless
leaves what in any other city than New
York might be called a large fortune.
MEXICO HOLDS
BACK INTEREST
Virtually Ignores Claim
of Catholic Church
of California.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.-Archbishop
Riordan of San Francisco is in Wash
ington, and with Archbishop Ireland
he has culled upon the President. It
is understood that one of the purposes of
his visit is to induce the Government of
the United States to renew its efforts to
secure the payment by the Mexican Gov
ernment to the Catholic church of Cali
fornia of more than $1,000,000 due to tho
church on account of what is known as
the "pious fund." Before the acquisition
of Upper California by the United States
the Catholic churches of Upper and Low
er California had on deposit with the
Mexican Government money and property
aggregating a very large total, upon
which the Mtxican Government was
obliged to pay the churches a certain an â¢
nual interest. In the case of the church
of Upper California this interest amount
ed to almost $50,000 annually. The interejt
payments ceased after the Mexican war.
but after the lapse of twenty years ?
claim on behalf of the church for interest
unpaid came before the Mexican Claims
Commission, which allowed the claim
But since that date, although the award
was paid by tne Mexican Government,
there have been no further payments of
interest, and ihe present purpose is to
press for a settlement of this interest ac
count. Negotiations have been proceed
ing in a way between Washington and
Mexico for some years past, but ther-*
have been no exchanges of recent datet
The Mexican Government has not showa
any disposition to avoid a settlement, but
bases its failure so far to pay interest on
the broad ground that the award by the
Mexican Claims Commission to the claim
ants of a sum aggregating nearly $100 -
00,000 acted legally as a settlement in ful!.
Presidential Appointments.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â The Presidert
to-day made the following appointments-
Warâ Chailes B. Nichols, surgeon uf
volunteers, rank of major; Joseph Her
rin, captain of cavalry; James B. Mitch
ell, captain of artillery corps; George C
Broome and Willis C. Mfctcalf, first lieu
tenants, Porto Rico provisional regiment
of infantry; Charles Andrews, surgeomof
volunteers, rank of major; Eugene Vkn
N. Bissel, second lieutenant of cavalry.
SCHLEY INQUIRY
IS NEARLY OVER
Admiral Dewey Expects
Public Sessions to
Soon Conclude.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.-Admiral Dewey
called on President Roosevelt to-day but
did not discuss with him the Schley court
of inquiry except to tell the Presidenr
that the public sessions of the court
would be concluded in a few days.
"When we begin to sift the testimony "
said the* admiral, "our real work will b"
gin. I told Secretary Long when ho
asked me to become president of the court
that I would rather go through another
battle in Manila Bay. The hardest par
of the work will be wading through thJ
mass of testimony and reaching our con
clusions. I have two able associates
however, and realize that we are on triii
before the corn try as well as Admira'
Schley. Two abler, better men could not
have been secured than Admirals Ben
ham and Ramsay."
Admiral Dewey said that the court
probably would take up each paragraph
of the precept find render such an opinion
as may be called for. He did not know
that this would be done, as he had net
discussed the case with*' his associate?
but it had occurred to him that this wouli
be a good plan. He felt, he said, that the
American people would want the court's
reasons in detail and were entitled to
know them.
Changes in Postal Department.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â Theodore In
galls of Louisville has been appointed
chief of the mail depredations division ol
the Postofflce Department. He too*
charge to-day, succeeding Emanuei
gpeich, tr.'*wferred to another branch of
the service.
RANSOM MONEY
IS INCREASED
One Thousand Dollars
More to Fund to Res
cue Miss Stone.
It Is Believed the Bandits
Will Accept the $66,000
Now Available.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â While com
munication has been established with the
brigands and the safety of Miss Stone
has been satisfactorily determined, seme
delay in her release is apt to arise be
cause of the difficulty in communicating
with her abductors.
The ransom fund has been increased,
the authorities have been informed. *y
$1000, making the total available for her
rescue $66,000. There is little prospect
that additions will be made to this sum.
Tha Boston board of missions will not
confcibute additional funds and the Gov
ernment has no appropriation from which
to draw for the balance.
The brigantis must therefore accept
$66,000 or nothing, and the authorties be
lieve that they will prefer the former
alternative. No dispatches were received
by the State Department from Eddy, the
secretary of the American Legation, or
Dickinson, Consul General at Sofia, show-
Ing that further communication has not
been had with the brigands.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Nov. 2.â The let
ter received from Miss Ellen M. Stone,
the American missionary referred to in
these dispatches yesterday, which it is
said was written two days previously,
turns out to be a few hurried lines on a
scrap of paper received at Samakov a
w-eek ago, but written a month before
'hat in which Miss Stone wrote of the ap
proaching expiration of the date. October
S, fixed for the payment of the ransom
demanded by the brigands, and a?ked
her friends to hurry up the money. The
missionaries who are working for Miss
Stone's release believe she is still alive.
Failure of a Silk Company .
BOSTON. Nov. 2.â Judge Colt of the
United States Circuit Court for this dis
trict has appointed Theodore Phylus King
of Quincy and Edmunds Putney of New
York receivers of the Eureka Silk Com
pany, which has offices in this city and a
factory at Canton. The appointment was
made upon the petition of William R.
Lyle & Co. of New York, creditors to the
amount of $120,000. The liabilities of the
company amount to $390,000, of which $385,
00 is owing on notes and $5000 on inciden
tal bills and accounts not yet rendered.
The value of the assets is not known.

AND HIMSELF

to Commit Murder
and Suicide.
AMSTERDAM, N. V., Nov. 2.-Fred
erick Bankert at 2 o'clock this morning
killed William Green by shooting him in
the neck with a revolver and splitting his
head open with a hatchet. Bankert also
shot Mrs. Green and cut her head open
with the hatchet, inflicting fatal wounds,
and then shot himself through the heart,
dying instantly.
Bankert gained entrance to Green's
apartments by climbing up a rope ladder
on the outside of the building and enter
ing a window. He was a suitor of Mrs.
Green before her marriage, but his love
was unrequited. For this reason he shot
her on November 23, 1895, and cut her
with a razor, but she recovered from her
wounds. For this crime Bankert was sent
to State prison, and was released from
there about six months ago.
Mrs. Green died at 4 o'clock this after
noon. She was formerly Miss Cora B.
Harrison. She was an accomplished
amateur actress and a handsome and at
tractive woman, 26 years old. Bankert
was 30 and Green was 22

CATTLEMEN ORGANIZING
TO PREVENT LEGISLATION
Will Oppose a Measure Providing for
the Leasing of Government
Lands.
OMAHA, Nov. 2.â A dispatch received
in this city from Harrison, Nebr. , is to
the effect that an organization of the cat
tlemen of that vicinity is being effected
to co-operate with the cattlemen and
sheepmen of Wyoming in opposition to a
bill providing for the leasing of Govern
ment lands.
The Omaha Commercial Club has by
resolution announced its opposition to the
measure. It has been stated that Senator
Millard of Nebraska will introduce the
bill, but in an interview to-day Senator
Millard declares that he has not yet de j
cided whether or not he will present the
measure. Senator Dietrich has announced
his support of the measure. The National
Irrigation Congress, on the other hand, is
opposing it. It is understood here that a
bill has been prepared by a prominent

ENGLISH PEOPLE STILL
BELIEVE THE KING IL.o
Physicians Prohibit Him From Smok
ing and Forbid the Use of Any
Alcoholics.
LONDON, Nov. 2.â When such serious
and ultra-re3pectable paper 3as the Lon
don Times and Lancet deem it advisable
to display announcements that King Ed
ward is not ill it can be reasonably de
ducted that a very general impression to
the opposite prevailed among those upper
classes by which these papers are read.
There is reason to believe that the King
was suffering within the last few days
from an ulcerated throat, which those
closely attached to him, especially the
women of his own family, feared must be
the forerunner of cancer. According to
tho pronouncements of the doctors, their
fears are unfounded. But King Edward is
prohibited from smoking and is forbidden
the use of any alcoholics. Whether the
physicians are concealing the truth even
from the royal patient and his family ia
a secret history alone can reveal, but it
is evident from the King's public appear
ances that there is nothing very immi
nently dangerous in his condition.f ADVERTISEMENTS."
PLAIN TALK
To Catarrh Sufferers.
Every person suffering from catarrh In
sts many forms knows that the common
lotions, salves and douches do not cure It
is needless to argue this point or to cite
cases 01: failure, because every victim of
catarrhil trouble knows it for himself if
be has tried them.
A local application. if It does any thine-
nt all. simply gives temporary relief- a
â¢u-ash, lotion, salve ,KÂ° r^ powder cannot :
reach the seat of the disease, which is
the blood.
The mucous membrane seeks to relieve
the blood of catarrhal poison by secreting
larpe quantities of mucus, the dischargi
sometimes closing up the nostrils de-
scendms to the throat and larynx cans
ir.g an irritating; cough, continual cieariii-
of the throat, deafness, indigestion aid
many ether disagreeable and persistent
symptoms. cut
A remedy to really cure catarrh mun
be an internal treatment; a remedy -which
will gradually cleanse the system from
catarrhil poison and remove the fever and
cogjon always present in the mucous
The eel remedies for this purpo-. are
Eucalyptol. Sanguinaria and HvdraVin
but the difficulty has always been to get
these valuable curatives combined in one
' palatable, convenient and efficient form
Recer.tly this has been accomplished
and thÂ» preparation put on the market
under the name of. Stuart's Catarrh Tab
leis: they are large, pleasant tastiiig
lozenges, so that they may be slowly dis
solved in the mouth, thus reaching every
part of the mucous membrane and finally
the stomach ana Intestines. ,
An a 3 vantage to be considered also is
that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets contain no
cocoaire, morphine or poisonous narcotics
so often found in catarrh powders and
the use of which often entails a habit
more dangerous than the disease.
Siuart's Catarrh Tablets are sold by
druggists at 50 cents for full-sized pack-
age and are probably the safest and most
effectual catarrh cure ori the market.

BALLOON DROPS
IN ON RANCHER
Great Gas Bag Journeys
Away When the
"Rope Breaks."
Thrilling Aerial Ride Looked
Upon as Advertising
Scheme.
The spectacle of a monster "captive"
balloon hovering over the city yesterday
afternoon attracted the attention of thou
sands of persons. The aerial traveler was
one that had been placed on exhibition
earlier in the day in a lot at Eleventh
and Market streets.
Shortly after 4 p. m. the balloon was
seen to soar into the air and travel rap
idly toward the south. The news was
spread all over the city that the balloon
had broken away from its fastenings and
that a number of men and women were
in the car and were likely to meet with
death.
Investigation, however, showed that the
balloon was in charge of an aeronaut, and
the seven men and one woman with him
were in no danger.
An advertising man, a gymnast and the
wife of a friend of the owner of the bal
loon were among those who took a jour
ney through the air, and it was stated
around the lot whenoe, the ascension
had been made that the convenient break
ing of a rope had set the captive free for
advertising purposes.
The owner of the balloon and his associ
ates were not at all concerned as to "the
safety of their property, and assured all
who made Inquiries that a descent would
be made without accident.
Last night the balloon and Its human
freight descended in safety at Wurr Mill
on the ranch of Beatty Thompson, situ
ated a few miles west of La Honda.
Thompson saw the aerial traveler circling
around, and when it came to a clearing
he caught the dangling rope and fastened
it to a tree. The aeronaut then let out
the gas and the passengers were soon on
terra firma. Thompson and his wife took
good care of the passengers and housed
them for the nieht.
Those who took the unlooked for aerial
journey were: Al Dodge, J. F. Leonard,
Q. Videdog, Ed Foster Jr., M. L. Ha
worth, Ed Dudley, Mrs. Clara Gonzales,
John M. Swift and Walter Leon.
LA ESTB.ELLA PARLOR
HAS HALLOWEEN PARTY
Young People Seek Information as to
What Is in Store for
Them.
Last Friday night La Estrella Parlor
No. 89, Native Daughters of the Golden
West, gave a Halloween partjj in the ban*
quet hall of the Native Sons' building.
The hall was crowded. All were pleas
antly entertained with a programme of
games appropriate to the time of the year,
which popular imagination has stamped
with a peculiar character because of the
belief that supernatural influences prevail,
and that by going through certain forms
and ceremonies those who go through
them may be made aware of what is in
store for them in the future.
The hall was given a weird appearance
by a liberal distribution of pumpkin lan
terns, but these did not strike terror into
the hearts of onlookers, many of whom
before the end of the party, to use an ex
pression of the street, "took a fall" out of
the grinning lanterns. By means of ap
ples, nuts and luggies many of the young
folks learned whether they would remain
single or get married, and the "witch of
the cavern" told many of what there is in
store for them.
An Interesting feature of the evening
was a ghost dance by twelve members of
the parlor. At the termination of this
dance the orchestra played for those who
wished to dance on till the early hours of
morn.

MANY TRACTION PLANS SUGGESTED
FOR THE PORTABLE SCHOOLHOUSE
Scheme of the Board of Education to Relieve Congested Attendance of
Pupils Will Work a Revolution in the Department, but Difficulties May
Be Encountered When the Building Is Sent Out to Hilly Districts
HELLO! Central! Give me Main
70. Hello! la that the Board of
Education?"
"Yes, this Is the Board of Ed
ucation."
"Well, this is Telegraph Hill. Will you
kindly send up the portable schoolhouse
Immediately? There are 115 pupils here
who are unable to get in the surrounding
schools. You'd better hitch up a couple
of extra horses to the house, as the hills
are steep hereabout. And say, I have
Just learned that the Fairmount Primary
cannot accommodate 68 pupils, and it is
necessary to send a school out in that
section. You might hitch an automobile
to it, as all the king's horses could not
drag It up the steepjjills in that vicinity."
The foregoing is a sample of the tele
phone messages which will drive Secre
tary Hansen to an early grave as soon as
the Board of Education carries out its
contemplated scheme to build a portable
school in order to relieve the congested
attendance throughout the city. At the
last meeting of the board Madame Pres
ident Kincaid outlined what she termed
as her pet scheme to put an end to the
oft-repeated charges that the schools aro
overcrowded. She explained that the plan

Carries Only Pullman Cars.
OMAHA, Neb., Nov. 2.â To-morrow the
Union Pacific will abandon the day
coaches and tourist sleepers heretofore
carried on its overland limited between
San Francisco and Chicago and in the
future the trains will be made up entirely
of Pullman cars. The train will . be put
on a parity with the Pennsylvania limited
and Empire State express and will carry
only first-class passengers, provided with
sleeping car tickets. The train will make
fewer stops than heretofore and the run
ning time between Chicago and San Fran
cisco will be reduced by several hours.
Â»
It Is expected that the project will
work a revolution in the administration
of school affairs. In the first place. Di
rector Mark believes that It is cheaper
to move than to pay rent, and says the
portable school will put an end to the ex
penditure of several thousand dollars
yearly for rental of outside rooms. It is
not known whether the- structure will be
propelled by horse power, automobile or
traction engine, but it is quite likely that
Casserly will insist that it be hauled to
its destination by polo ponies, driven tan
dem, with the altitudinous Director him
self at the reins. Great care would have
to be exercised to prevent the animals
running away while school was in ses
sion, as the spilling of the pupils promis
cuously along the road might prove dis
astrous.
Funeral of James Stanton.
The funeral of the late James Stanton,
a pioneer of this State, took place early,

relatives of the deceased attended, it

should be made. A requiem mass will be
celebrated on Tuesday morning at St.
Ignatius Church, where his many friends
will have an opportunity of paying a
tribute to his memory.

OF THE ISTHMIAN CANAL
He Does Not .Believe That It Can
Be Built or Profitably

NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â Mr. . and Mrs
Andrew Carnegie were passengers upon
the St. Louis, which reached her dock late
this afternoon. Carnegie refused to dis
cuss New York politics, saying he was no
partisan. He was questioned with regard
to the proposed technical school at Pitts
burg and said he had received a report
upon the subject, and when asked if it
was true that the committee had asked
for $5,000,000 his reply was:
"The committee is incapable of asking
for money. The report was truly Ameri
can and worthy of PittsÃurg."
Questioned concerning the steel situa
tion Mr. Carnegie laughed, saying: 'I
am out of business; I have reformed."
Then he added: "I have heard something
of the forming of an English steel trust.
The English are not inclined to combine.
It has been said that every Englishman
is an island by himself."
"Have you any views upon the subject
of the Isthmian canal?" was the next
question put to him.
"I do not believe in the canal at all. I
do not believe a canal will render the
service for the transportation of goods
that a first-class two-track rairoad would
do. Freight could be unloaded into fifty

"Would you therefore favor a Tehuan

"They are building a railroad there now,
but not of that kind. Ido not believe that
the Nicaragua canal can be built. I do
not belijve that that canal can be worked,
even if it is built. The Panama canal can

CLOSING NIGHT
OF EXPOSITION
Buglers Sound Taps as
the Lights Are Shut
Off for Good.
Stockholders Suffer a Loss
of Several Million
Dollars.
BUFFALO. N. V.. Nov. 2.â The â¢Pan-
American Exposition ended at 12 o'clock
to-nlght. At midnight President John G.
Milburn pressed an electric button and
the lights in the famous electric tower
grew dim for the last time. Slowly one
by one the lights on post and pinnacle and
tower faded away. A corps of buglers
standing in the tower sounded "taps" as
one of the greatest glories of the exposi
tion, the electrical illumination, passed
away, and the exposition was ended.
The exhibition has not been a financial
success, but the benefits derived from it
will be of great value to the commercial
Interests of the country. The primary ob
ject of the exposition was to advance the
friendly relations and commercial inter
course between the United States and the
other countries of the two Americas. In
this respect it has been a decided suc
cess.
The financial loss will be In the neigh
borhood of $3,000,000. The statement to be
Issued by the officers of the exposition
setting forth the expenditures and re
ceipts will be made public some time this
month. Until then the company will make
no formal statement. The loss will fall
upon the holders of the common stock,
the holders of second-mortgage bonds and
the contractors who erected the buildings.
Two hundred and ten thousand shares of
common stock were sold at $10 a share.
The stock was subscribed for by the cit
izens of Buffalo and the Niagara frontier
in small lots of from one share to 100, so
that the loss will not be severely felt by
any one.
Stockholders Make No Complaint.
No complaint has been heard from the
holders of common, who appreciate the
benefit the exposition has been to the
city. There is also a feeling of satisfac
tion that the enterprise was carried to
a successful end without State or Federal
aid. The first-moptgage bonds, amounting
to $2,600,000, will be paid in full. An Issue
of $500,000 second-mortgage bonds is un
provided for, but the revenue from salv
age and buildings and from other sources
will probably cover a part of this Indebt
edness. The remainder due to contractors
is not definitely known, but it is said that
It represents their profits for the work
done, and no one will be severely embar
rassed by the loss.
An average of 2,000,000 admissions a
month had been figured on by the exposi
tion officials. The great snowstorm of
last April was a severe blow to the expo
sition. An immense r mount of work was
undone and work on the grounds and
buildings was oelayed for a week. Stren
uous efforts were made to make up the
lost time, but on May 1 a vast amount of
work remained undone, and the formal
opening of the exposition was postponel
until May 20. The lamentable tragedy in
the Temple of Music was another blow
to the Pan-American. The attendance
had been increasing steadily up to the
date of the assassination of President Mc-
Klnley. The gates were closed for two
days, and when they reopened there was
a drop of 18 per cent in the attendance,
and no Improvement followed.
Petty Thieving of Exhibits.
Tife Government exhibit, which is a
beautiful and :nstructive collection, will
be at once shipped to Charleston.
A large crowd attended the exposition
to-day. The exhibit buildings were
jammed during the afternoon and there
Vas much petty thieving of exhibits by
souvenir fiends.
The fruit and wine exhibits in the Horti
cultural building suffered the greatest
loss from the depredations of the crowd,
and it finally became necessary to turn
the people out of the building and lock the
doors.
There was a veritable riot on the mid
way this afternoon. The disorder started
from a quarrel between an Intoxicated
man and a waiter. The crowd took the
part of the stranger and wrecked the
place, smashing chairs, tables and win
dows. A stream of water from a fire hose
finally put the mob to rout.
The total admissions to-day were 129,233.
and for six months 8,295.073.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1901.
PATRICK BARRY
IS EXONERATED
Testimony That Walter
Gilbert Was the
Aggressor.
A Coroner's jury decided yesterday that
Walter Gilbert, who died in the Central
Emergency Hospital last Thursday of 1
fracture of the skull, came to his death
at the hands of Patrick Barry, and that
Barry's act was justifiable homicide.
Barry, the man alleged to have inflicted
the fatal blow, has charge of a grocery
and bar at 814 Howard street, with his
brother Lawrence. He told the jury that
on last Wednesday morning Gilbert came
into the store and informed him that ho
had recently arrived from the East with
a sister. He then asked Barry whether
or not there was a side entrance to tho
saloon. Gilbert returned at 1 o'clock in
the afternoon and went to the back part
of the saloon, and when he returned an. l
was making for the street with Barry's
coat on his arm Barry protested. Gilbert
resisted and the two engaged in a fisr.
fight. When they had fought their way to
the sidewalk Barry succeeded in planting
a strong right-hand blow on Gilbert's
nose. Gilbert fell on his face on the basalt
block pavement and the witness did not
molest him any further.
Lawrence Barry, brother of the accused,
testified thet he and John Rowan were
sitting in a room back of the bar" when
Gilbert and an unknown man came in.
"Which one will we lick first?" asked
the unknown jf Gilbert.
Then the stranger and Lawrence Barry
engaged in a fist fight, and Rowan went
outside to look for a policeman. What-
Pat Barry and Gilbert were doing in an
other part of the store witness could not
see. as he had his hands full with the
stranger.
The police authorities have released
Patrick Barry.
GROCER MANGELS IS

RICE'S MURDER
BEING PROBED
Prosecution Is Forging a
Chain Around
Buckley.
Edward Lahey, a New Wit
ness, Gives Evidence of
Importance.
The preliminary examination of William,
Buckley, Thomas Moran, Charles Don
nelly and Edward Duncan, charged with
the murder of George W. Rice at Twen
tieth and Howard streets on the evening
of October 11, was continued before Judge
Mogan yesterday afternoon. There are
eighteen more witnesses to be examined
for the prosecution and it will take a long
time yet, as every witness is subjected to
a long and severe cross-examination.
When the case was called Policeman
Brown was recalled and asked a few un
important questions. Policeman Lycette
followed him to the stand. Lycette testi
fied that he was in the buggy with Brown
when they pursued and captured Buck
ley after the shooting.
Sergeant Duke testined to taking Rice s
dying statement at the City and County
Hospital and that Rice said when Buck
ley was shown Â«him: "That's the man."
Lycette was also present when Assistant
Warrant and Bond Clerk Burke and De
tectives Dinan and Bailey came to the
hospital about an hour later with Buck
ley. At that time Rice said he did not
know that Buckley was the man who shot
him, and his mind was then getting
clouded. He did not remember telling
Rice before he made his ante-mortem
statement that the doctors said he was
going to die. He tnought he made the
statement to the nurses. He was sub
jected to a long cross-examination, but
his evidence in chief was not materially
shaken.
Edward Lahey, a brass molder living on
Florida street, a new witness, was then
examined. He said he got off the car at
Nineteenth street and while walking
down to Shotwell street he saw two men
running from Shotwell down Nineteenth
street. They ran to Folsom street and
one went one way and the other the other
way. One had a light hat on.
Detective Bailey testified that he and
Detective Ryan arrested Moran at his
lodging-house, 536 Third street. The ar
rest was made after Buckley had made a
statement in the City Prison that he was
not at the scene of the shooting and had
stated that Moran, Duncan and Donnelly
could prove it. Bailey's examination was
not concluded when court adjourned. The
case was continued till next "Wednesday
morning.
HOLY REDEEMER FAIR
COMES TO A CLOSE
Large Sum Realized and Will Be
Used Toward Completion of
New Church.
Out in Eureka Valley Father J. P. Mc-
Quaide has been holding a church fair in
aid of the Church of the Holy Redeemer
he is erecting for the parisioners. Last
night was practically the closing night
of the fair and a very large crowd was
present. "Bert" Mahony, Republican
candidate for County Clerk, who is a
warm friend of "Father Joe," as he is
familiarly known, was present and helped
to enliven matters in his efforts to win a
Diogenes lamp. John E. Richards, a
prominent Young Men's Institute repre
sentative, helped Mr. Mahony and his
friends to all they needed. He was in com
plete control of the wheel of fortune.
Mr. Richards makes a most clever
"spiel," but the public will not have an
o>...er opportunity to listen to his oratory
until the Miesion Dolores parish holds a
fair. More men like Mr. Richards would
help out church fairs in every way.
Eather MiQualde said last night that he
was more than pleased with the result of
the fair that was inaugurated to assist
the building fund of his new church in the
new parish in Eureka Valley.
Father McQuaide was reared and edu
cated in this city and his friends are
legion. Consequently there has been a big
i attendance throughout his fair.
On Monday and Tuesday evenings a
rummage sale will be held, which is being
conducted in the basement of the Church
of the Holy Redeemer, which is building
on Diamond street. Most valuable articles
I will' be auctioned off.
GOLDEN JUBILEE FAIR
CLOSES THIS EVENING
Programme of Vocal and Instru
mental Music and Recitations
Has Been Prepared.
The Golden Jubilee Fair, which has
proved to be one of the most successful
festivals ever held in this city, will come
to a conclusion to-night., A large crowd
visited the fair last night and it is antici
pated that a still greater crowd will be in
attendance to-night. The entire interior
of the San Francisco Turn Verein Hall
has been decorated so as to appropriately
represent picturesque scenes in Germany.
The wine garden, which has gained much
popularity, is situated upon a dais orna
mented with pictures of the blue Rhein
and other scenes from the fatherland. The
tables are attended by young ladles dress
ed in short skirts, with flowers inter
twined in their glossy tresses like the
lasses of olden times about whom the
German bards loved to sing.

DUBOSE REFUSES
TO MAKE ANSWER
Becomes Irritated at
Pillsbury's Many
Questions.
Word Comes That Stevens
and Wheeler Are
Displaced.
A slow, weary morning was passed in
Commissioner Heacock's room yesterday
morning during the examination of wit
nesses in the Nome contempt cases. Dud
ley Dubose took the stand at the opening
of the proceedings for the conclusion of
the cross-examinatton and the re-direct
examination. He was followed by C. A.
S. Frost, who was taken in hand by tho
amicus curiae until the examination ad
journed.
Nothing of a startling or important na
ture developed during the day. Duboje
was questioned on such matters as sug
gested a possible discrepancy between his
testimony and that of W. H. Hume. Frost
was cross-examined on his connection
with the Department of Justice at Wash
ington. Each uay the witness is becom
ing more and more testy, and yesterday
he and E. S. Pillsbury, amicus curiae.
had a merry tilt, which ended by the wit
ness accusing Mr. Pillsbury of imper
tinence and refusing to answer the ques
tions.
Of more imDortance than yesterday's
proceedings is the advice received from
Nome of the displacement of R. N. Ste
vens as Commissioner and Recorder and
"F. K. Wheeler as Commissioner of NornÂ«
precinct. Judge Wlckersham sets forth
in . an order that Stevens and Wheeler
shall make returns and file their final ac
counts with the United States district
clerk within five days from the serving of
the order of the court. The offices are
also proclaimed not to be dual, and Judge
Thomas M. Reed is appointed to fill the
various duties performed by Stevens and
Wheeler. The Judge's opinion shows that
Stevens was more than the pooh-bah of
Nome. In him four distinct offices lodge.!
and his salary was commensurate with
the general undertaking.
SAN FRANCISCO ELKS
HAVE A LADIES' NIGHT
A Large Number of the City's Fairest
Women Most Hospitably
Entertained.
San Francisco Lodge No. 3, Benevolent
and Protective Order of Elks, on last
Friday night added another to its vic
tories in the entertaining line. It gave a
ladies' night at headquarters on Sutter
street and Grant avenue, under the su
pervision of the ways and means com
mittee, of which J. N. O'Dell is chair
man. Arrangements having been made to
entertain about 800 people who wÂ«re so
fortunate as to receive invitations, it was
found that the lodgeroom was not of
sufficient capacity to admit all, so if was
agreed that the entertainment should be
given in Sherman-Clay Hall, in the same
building, and the luncheon served in the
lodgeroom. The American flag and fes
toons of green, were prominent in the
decorations.
The programme of entertainment was
made up of music, songs and specialties
by professional talent, with a few am
ateur numbers to fill in while profes
sionals were on their way from the
theaters. Among those who contributed
to the oleasure of the assembled many
were Robert Lloyd, Miss O'Brien, Charles
and Mrs. Reynolds. Andy Dadau, Harris
and Wether from the Orpheum. John Gei
ger, Grazer and Trelease, and many
others, who kept the boards until after
midnight.
Luncheon consisted of sandwiches,
toothsome salads, excellent coffee, cakes
in variety and ice cream bricks, all served
by experienced waiters. The officers of
the lodge were unsparing in their attent
ion to the guests and by so doing created
an impression upon those who never be
fore had attended a ladies' night by the
lodge of the "best people on earth."

During the past month many valuable
acquisitions have been made to the Amer
ican library ( for Manila, which is being

Pathetic Scene in Court.
The case of Mrs. Mary Davies and Gus
Naher of Fresno, charged with perform
ing a criminal operation upon Beuiah N.
Sigsmund, a niece of Naher's wife, was
continued before Judge Mogan yesterday.
After the girl had given her testimony
her aged grandmother, who was in court,
held out her arms toward her and the
young girl was soon weeping hysterically
on the old lady's shoulder. The case will
be continued next week.

IT seemed almost like the same o!-j
hustling, bustling first day crowd at
Oakland track yesterday afternoon.
To be sure, some few or this side 01
the bay demurred at the new toll of

nearly 4(XK> people took advantage of the
delightful weather and attended the open-
Ing of the racing season under the aus
pices of the New California Jockey Club.
The fair sex was well represented In the
â¢stand as usual, and things about the
clubhouse assumed once more their gala
appearance. Election matters kept many
away, and it is a Burlingame polo pony
to a Telegraph Hill billygoat that those
Â¦who are objecting to the raise in admis
sion ice will be in line next week. .
The track had been specially prepared
for the # occasion, and while no records
â¢were demolished fast time was the rule.
Thirteen regular books, two field book*
and a. combination book laid odds, and
while none of ihe big bettors appeared to
have unpacked their baggage there was
no complaint about business being dull.
The fields weie all large, and lavorltes
had a hard row to hoe all through the
fusillading. Homestead, the two-year-old
from Green Morris stable, alone upheld
the reputation of the choices.
No one particular feature of the sport
was more thoioughly enjoyed than the
starting of "Jake" Holtman, which was
performed witnout the recall flag- For
his oftort in tront of the stand in dis
patching the eleven starters in the Open

warmly applauded by the big throng
present.

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1901.
WINNER OF THE FIRST RACE AND INCIDENTS OF OPENING DAY AT OAKLAND TRACK,
UNCLE HENRY HARRIS' SPEEDY MEN DEFEAT THE SENATORS POINTLESS
IN A GAME TO WHICH DEVEREAUX CONTRIBUTES THE ONLY ERROR
UNCLE HENRY'S youngsters
played errorless baseball yester
day at Recreation Park, shut
ting. Sacramento out without a
tally. The Wasps tried the
"double steal" successfully three times,
sending three men across the plate. In
this play they were aided by Flood, sec
ond base man for the Senators, whose
throwing to the home plate to shut off the
runner lacked accuracy.
Devereaux is charged with the only er
ror made in the game. Nordyke hit a hot
one to him and he propped himself, ex
pecting the ball to bound into his hands.
Instead it rolled between his legs, the bat
ter beine safe on first.
The Wasps scored two in the first in
ning. Nordyke, the first batter up, lined
out a three-bagger. Wilson hit to second,
Nordyke being caught out at the plate.
Hildebrand singled. Schwartz singled,
scoring Wilson. Pabst was safe at first,
but fotced Schwartz at second. Pabst and
Hildebrand worked the double steal,
"Hildy" scoring.
In the fourth the double steal again
worked successfully. Pabst was on third
and Riley on first.
The Wasps scored their last two runs
in the fifth. Nordyke scored on the pop
ular double steal. Hildebrand was given
a pass to first and scored on Schwartz's
two-bagger.
There were a number of close decisions,
fn which the Senators thought they re
ceived harsh treatment from Umpire Har
ner. The score:

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. ?
The varsity eleven defeated thÂ«
University of Nevada football
team by a score of 12 to 6 this aft
ernoon. The game was the last
which the cardinal eleven was schedule-i
for prior to the big game next Saturday,
and while they triumphed over the Sage
brush men and kept the ball in Nevada
territory most of the time they played
ball that was frequently ragged.
The game was interesting and exciting,
however. There were numerous fumble-*,
and several times the cardinal runner wu
tackled behind the line. The cardinal
team did not play the style of ball to
which It is best adaptedâ that is, a con
tinuous line-bucking game. Punting was
resorted to far too frequently when gainj
could have, been made by hammering the.
Nevada line. Hill dropped back fcr punt*
eleven times, and on not more than two
occasions did he do this in order to pre
vent losing the ball on downs.
The men from Reno did not execute
over thirty-five plays during the entire
game, and about half of these were kicks
by Graham. It was a kicking game from
start to finish, and both Graham and Hill
showed up well. Hill generally gained a
little on exchange of punts, his longest
kick being about fifty-flve yards. The
Navadans worked the old guards back
formation v<Â»ry effectively on three o;
four occasions, battering the Stanford
line for good gains, but their attempt*
at trick plays were failures.
Cardinal's Play Uncertain.
The cardinal team was not put on thÂ«
defensive very often, and consequently it
is hard to determine its ability along that
line, which Is regardec as Stanford's weaJc
point. At times the eleven braced and
held like a wall, at other times the Ne
vada men sifted through the Use with,
apparent ease.
The varsity line-up at the beginning of
the first half was practically the same as
it will be on November 9. Apparently the
only unsettled positions on the team are
center and left end. Lee has been playing
the position well during the week and he
showed up well to-day, playing the first
half. Hauverman also played well, and
the next few days will have to determine
which one will face California's center.
Cooper is a sure man >at right end and
the other ends tried in the game to-day
made good showings, particularly Preston
and Tarpey. McFadden. Traeger, Slaker.
Fisher and Hill appeared to be equally
effective in advancing the ball, seldom
falling to make gains. At guards Barn
htsel and Thompson put up a steady, con
sistent game. "Stub' Raitt played 1n his
usual brilliant style, appearing at hiÂ« best
in running in the ball on Graham's kicks.

JEFFRIES SUBMITS TO A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION BY DR. CHARLES A. CLINTON,
WHO AT ONCE PRONOUNCES HIM THE MOST PERFECT ATHLETE HE HAS EVER SEEN
CADETS PLAY
YALE TIE GAME
Greatest Contest Ever
Seen on West Point
Field.
Harvard Defeats Brown, and
Princeton Takes Game
From Cornell.
WEST POINT, N. T., Nov. 2.â ln thÂ«
most closely contested football game ever
played on the West Point field the cadets
to-day tied Yale's strong team by a score
of [ to 5. Daly was in fine form and was
ably supported by every man oif the home
team. There was a great deal of fumb
ling, in which West Point was the gainer.
The cadets were not on the defensive,
but on the offensive, and the battle was
mostly fought in Yale's territory.
The first half was unquestionably In
Tale's favor, but after a severe struggle
the visitors succeeded in making only one
touchdown, and this near the end of the
first half. West Point's generalship was
euperlor to that of Yale. The latter had
more muscle and brawn, but the soldiers
had nerve and mettle. In the second half
the pigskin was in Yale's territory almost
continuously. Near the last stage Daly,
for West Point, kicked a goal from the
field. In five minutes more time was
called, and the score stood 5 to 6.
ITHACA, H. V. f Nov. Princeton
scored a hard fought victory over Cornell
this afternoon by the narrow margin of
two points, the final score being 8 to 0.
Princeton won on a safety allowed by
Referee Wrlghtlngton. This was vigor
ously protested by Cornell. It resulted
from a trial for a goal from the field by
Right Tackle Dewitt. The ball missed the
goal posts by # several feet, but it was
picked up by Brewster, Cornell's quarter
back, who was shoved back over the line
by a Princeton player. Cornell took the
position that the Princeton man was off
side before Brewster took possession of
the ball, but the official decision was to
the contrary.
It was now too dark to distinguish the
teams before time Â¦ was called, and be
cause of this the deciding play was made
more uncertain. The score had stood 6 to
6 throughout the greater part of the sec
ond naif and a tie game was looked for.
NSW YORK, Nov. 2.â Between 8000 ajid
SOW people saw the Columbia football
team shut out the representatives of the
University of Pennsylvania at the Polo
grounds to-day. In the first half Co
lumbia scored two touchdowns from one
of which a goal was kicked, while the
Pennsylvania men failed to get near their
opponent's goal line. Columbia, 11; Penn
sylvania, 0.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. Harvard
easily defeated Brown this afternoon, 48
to 0. ,Five touchdowns were made in the
first half and three in -he second.
DETROIT. Nov. 2.â The University of
Michigan defeated the Carlisle Indian
School football team a Bennett Park
this afternoon before 8000 people by the
Bcore of 22 to 0. "VYu Ting Fang, the Chin.
ese Minister, occupied one of the boxes
with ex-Secretary of War Alger and at
the close of the game in response to the
demands of the spectators he addressed
them, congratulating Michigan on her
victory.
Most of Carlisle's gain were made with
their "wingshift" play, the entire team
shifting over and attacking the Michigan
line between- end and tackle. Michigan,
however, finally solved the play and broke
It up. Michigan's gains were made princi
pally by hard line bucking.
MILWAUKEE, Nov. 2.â Wisconsin Uni
versity gave the Nebraska University a
drubbing on the gridiron this afternoon,
the score being 18 to 0. The Nebraska
eleven was by far the hardest proposition
Wisconsin has encountered this season.
In the first half Cortelyou. for Nebraska,
on a beautiful double pass, got around
Wisconsin's left end with a clear field be
fore him, but was prevented from scoring
a touchdown by Cockem's great sprint,
being brought down ten yards from Wis
consin's goal.
CHICAGO. Nov. Th* brilliant work
of Merrill. Smith and McÃae averted im
pending defeat for the Beloit eleven to
day. The final score was: Chicago, 17:
Beloit. 17.

GUS RUHLIN SHOWS ONE OF THE NOVEL. INSTRUMENTS HE USES
IN PERFECTING HIS PHYSICAL CONDITION FOR HIS FORTHCOM
ING FIGHT WITH JEFFRIES AT MECHANICS' PAVILION.
The Champion Eases Up in His Work to Avoid
Any Possibility of Becoming Overtrained.
MARBIN SPRINGS, Nov. 2.â At
the request of The Call Dr.
Charles A. Clinton of San Fran
cisco, who has been here in at
tendance upon some of his pa
tients, made a physical examination of
the champion yesterday and his verdict
was that Jeffries was a superb specimen
of manhood and was in perfect condition.
The examination was made shortly after
"Jim " had returned from a long run over
the hills. Although he perspired freely
and took off four pounds the champion
was as fresh as the proverbial daisy.
Jeff did not demur to the examination.
He did not expect to be told he was suf
fering from "the ills that flesh is heir to,"
nor did he fear to be told he war not in
condition. He was friendly to the doctor
because the latter performed a slight
operation on his lower lip, which was
badly puffed from a collision with hia
brother's hard head.
The physician subjected Jeffries to a
critical examination. He used the stetho
scope and other surgical Instruments to
make it thorough.
When Jeffries gazed upon The Call's
photograph of Ruhlin yesterday he re
marked: "He looks quite fat." "Jim"
seldom talks about his coming fight or
about his opponent, and this statement
from him can be looked upon in the light
of a criticism. Hctias fought Ruhlin and
has seen him fight repeatedly and the
FAST HOMER BOY

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1901.
REDWOOD CITT, Nov. B.â Gus
Ruhlin drew a crowded house at
the Alhambra Theater to-night,
where he was announced to Illus
trate his training exercises and
also to box a limited number of rounds
with "Denver" Ed Martin, "Charley" Goff
and "Joe" McAuliffe. Ruhlin showed in
excellent condition and the exhibition was
Akron giant's condition seemed to be of
great moment to him. Gus must beware
oecause the big fellow will surely try to
play a tatto on his stomach Instead of
striving to land on the jaw.
Jeff eased up in his work yesterday.
Instead of laboring in the gymnasium he
did outdoor work. A brisk jaunt over the
mountains and two games of baseball,
with light work with the chest weights,
completed his day's training. Jeffries
started out about 10 'o'clock and two
friends accompanied him in a cart. The
big fellow simply ran away from them.
He returned about 2 o'clock, but hi* com
panions did not materialize until two
hours later.
While Jen" was being groomed by his
trainers he talked with his visitors about
the effects of heavy blows. He said he
did not take punishment like other bcxers
He added that he had often been hit hard
but seldom with force enough to worry
him.
One of the visitors noticed that while
the champion lay out on the rubbing
board his chest stood out prominently
end that he showed no stomach. Brother
Jack was chopping with great force upon
the champion's dining department, but
Jim did not feel it. This is due to the
ridge of muscles that he has, like Shar
key, developed to fortify the solar plexus
Jim says he has been hit in that region
by Fitzsimmons and the latter never hurt
him. As for Sharkey, the champion states
the sailor never landed a blow upon him

a most satisfactory one to the spectators.
The stage had been roped off and a plat
form built, from which was suspended the
punching bag. Ruhlin went through his
dumbbell exercises, skipped the rope and
punched the bag, besides doing some
clever footwork. During the punching of
the bag it was knocked from its support
and went out among the spectators. An

Al tne request or me Call I made a thorough physical examination
at Harbin Springs of James J. Jeffries, the champion pugilist of the
world. I find his weight and measurements as above given.
"I have examined a great many athletes and pugilists in my
time, but none to equal the magnificent physique of the champion. He
is proportioned like a Greek god and possesses the strength and endurance
of a Roman gladiator. In a word he is a perfect and magnificent speci
man of manhood. Every organ 'in his bodyâ including the heart, lungs, liver,
stomach, spleen and kidneysâ are perfectly normal. His muscular develop
ment is superb. It is faultless. The strength of a chain is in its weakest
link. My examination failed to find a weak point in the champion's entirt
body.
"During my short stay at Hnrbln Springs I watched him closely daily
going through his various physical exercises, including boxing, rowing, skip
ping the rope and handball, and considering his great size, his activity,
quickness and agility are truly phenomenal.
"While his capacity to receive an-J assimilate punishment is great, his
power and ability to inflict it is terrific. This is evidenced by his battle
with Sharkey and the latter's defeat, and fractured ribs, which were tire
results of the contest.
"He revels in hard work. The harder it is the better he likes it and it
does not seem to tire him, which emphasizes his fine physical state.
The condition of his nervous system is excellent. He is even-tempered,
good-natured and as frolicsome as a schoolboy on a vacation.
"CHARLES A. CLINTON. M. D."
that ever caused him to worry. In speak
ing of his last fight with Sharkey, Jim
said the kinetoscope did not do him jus
tice; that he was meeting the sailor every
time he rushed and only broke ground
oncQ or twice in the entire fight.
Jeff will take no more long runs over
the hills. He will confine his outdoor work
to strolling in the mountains and short
sprints and baseball. From now on he
will work in the gymnasium with a view
to gaining speed. He will not do too much
boxing for fear of injuring his hands at
the eleventh hour. Handball, skipping the
rope, bag punching and rowing will form
his daily menu for training.
When the champion boxes with Arm
strong or his brother he allows those two
heavy punchers to swat him with all their
might. He even pokes out his lean but.
hardened jaw to receive the- blows. He
does this in order to accustom himself to
remain cool when being punched.
AWAIT ANSWER
FROM COLOMBIA
MEXICO CITY, Nov. 2.â At to-day's
meeting of the Pan-American Congress
General Rafael Reyes, delegate of Colom
bia, in a speech full of praise for the
United States proposed that H. C. Davis,
chairman of the United Â§tates delegation,
be elected president of the Pan-American
Congress. Davis thanked the delegate
and declined the office.
The provisional president, Generaro* Ral
gosa, chairman of the Mexican delegation,
was elected president of the congress,
Durar Pera of Brazil was elected first vice
president, and Balletzar Esturpinian of
Salvador second vice president.
Senator Carbo of Ecuador proposed
naming Secretary Hay as an additional
honorary president, which action was
unanimously taken.
Delegate Gil Fortout of Venezuela said
he had received no word that President
Castro of Venezuela had replied to the
resolution of the conference with respect
to avoidance of a war between his country
and Colombia, and he asked the president
of the conference if a reply had been re
ceived from Colombia.
President Raigosa stated that the reply
of the President of Venezuela had been
received by the Foreign Office of Mexico,
but up to the present moment neither the
Foreign Office, nor he as president of the
other time It was knocked to the far end
of the stage.
The preliminary bout was between Den
ver Ed Martin and Charley Goff. After
this Ruhlin sparred alternately with Mar
tin, Goff and McAuliffe. Ruhlin was
cheered to the echo after each round. He
showed himself a master with the gloves,
none of those with whom he boxed being

Every day a new trick is planned by
the champion. Last night he tried to
take a heavy calf up to Bob Armstrong's
rocm, but the animal spoiled the game by
crying and the colored boxer was warned
Bob is being called "Syndicate" by rea
son of his penchant for playing poker
with money gathered from every member
of the training staff. He always loses,
but this does not worry him in the least.
Jack Jeffries announced last evening
that his brother was fit to fight the battle
or nis life; that, barring unforseen acci
dents, Jim would go into the arena on
the evening of the 15th inst. capable of
putting forth his best efforts. Jack says
he has never known his brother to be in
such excellent shape. He has worked
with Jeff for the last four years and as
he has trainee the champion for all his
contests his statement should have some
weight with those who are anxious to get
a line on the big fellow's condition.
Venezuela delegation, had received any
reply from Colombia.
Gil Fortout said he thought diplomatic
usage demanded that no official report of
the reply of Venezuela be made until the
reply of Colombia should be received He
therefore asked the chair to withhold the
reply of Venezuela until Colombia should
be heard from.
General Reyes of Colombia said he be
lieved the reason for the delay in the re-
c f'?. t , of f- message from the Government
of Colombia was due to an interruption of
the telegraph lines which passed through
a rough country. He was quite certain no
discourtesy was Intended.
President Raigosa said he would act in
accordance with the representation of Gil
Fortout as being in conformity with
diplomatic usage, but if the conference
wished otherwise he would have to bow to
its wishes. The conference declared it did
not wish to run counter to the request of
Gil Fortout.
The members of the arbitration and
court of arbitration committee appointed
by the several delegations to the confer
ence were announced to-day. Buchanan
was re-elected as the United States rep
resentative.

MINERS FIND
FAMOUS LEDGE
Remarkable Gold Strike
Reported in Shasta
County.
Arbuckle Claim, Lost for
Many Years, Said to *
Be Located.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
REDDING, Nov. 2.â A notable goM
strike has been made in the ArbuciJT-i
mining district, thirty miles southwest of
Redding. The Arbuckle ledge, noted in
the early days and lost for many years,
has been found again by two young pros
pectors. a
In the early mining days the pioneers
took fortunes from packets near the sur
face along this ledge. The men who have
made the discovery have found coarse
gold at a slight depth and are opening
up a claim which gives evidence of being
a great gold mine.
The news started a rush to the section
and prospectors are arriving in the vicin
ity day and night. Great excitement pre
vail* there. It is believed that mines may
be opened there which will equal the
noted MWas mine, 3ome miles farther
west at Harrison Gulch, which sent out
from $30,000 to $40,0 X) per month.
NO NEWS FOB- POOLIMXSMS.
Men Who Operate in Yolo Cannot Get
Telegraph Wire.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 2.âAnnounce
ments had been sent broadcast through
the city yesterday to the effect that the
poolrooms across the Sacramento River
bridge in Yolo County would open for the %
winter season to-day. The reporters were {
accordingly on hand, and they found the
blackboard decorated with the names v!
the various horses written in fancy cray
ons. But there was a hitch somewhere,
and. anxious as were the sports to sep
arate themselves from their coin, they
did not get the opportunity.
The word was soon passed around that
Kripp and Ross, the poolroom men, had
been notified by the local manager of the
Western Union Telegraph Company' that
they could not secure a wire from the
Oakland track, and consequently no re
ports of the races could be furnished
them. It is stated here that the presi
dent of the racing association at Oakland
has made an order directing that no news
be sent from the track to outside towns
for gambling purposes, as such action
might be used against the association
during the next Legislature. The pool
room men will try to get the news from
Oakland by means of the telephone.FORTUNE TELLER

at 1:30 o'clock. The marriage ceremony
was performed by the Rev. Alfred Kum

in San Jose. But a few relatives and
intimate friends witnessed the wedding,
which was marked by a simplicity of de
tail.
After returning from their honeymoon,
which Is to be spent in the interior of the
State, Mr. and Mrs. Patton will reside hi

groom has fitted up a cozy home for the
reception of his bride.
Mr. Patton has lived here since boy
hood and is widely known and popular.
His father was one of the pioneer archi
tects of California and designed the City
Hall of San Francisco. The elder Patton
left a valuable estate, which is now
emerging from litigation. William Pat
ton Jr. and his brother, C. A. Patton, are
heirs to the property.

CHATJFFEITBS SEEKING
ADDITIONAL CONCESSIONS
Are Preparing to Again Move Upon
â¢ the Park Commissioners to Have
Strictures Removed.
At the monthly meeting of the Auto
mobile Club of California held at the Cliff
House on Wednesday nSght, Dr. Tillman,
vice president of the club, was in the
chair. P. F. Rockett, C. C. Moore, Byron
Jackson, Dorville Libby and Robert C.
Lennie addressed those in attendant.
It was the consensus of opinion that the
chauffeurs should seek further conces
sions from the Park Commissioners. It
was decided to await the return of Presi
dent F. A. Hyde, who is now in the East,
before taking action.
Hitherto the directors and attorney of
the Automobile Club of California have
chiefly busied themselves with endeavor
ing to secure the passage of reasonable
ordinances by the various Boards of Su
pervisors in the counties lying round San
Francisco Bay, but in the future special
efforts will be made to develop the social
side of the club. The next run will be to
Niles Canyon, the winter, owing to the
absence of dust, being the pleasantest
season for automobiling in the country.
Hitherto nearly all the locally owned,
self propelled carriages have been and
still are steam vehicles of light weight
and construction, but it i 3 probable the
demand for heavier rigs of stronger con
struction and greater power will increase.
In order to test the radius of action of
the various types of vehicles it has been
suggested that there should be a race
from the city around the Day and back,
or to the top of Mount Hamilton and re
turn in a day, or to Los Angeles. The
owners and agents of all the types of
vehicles known here would be invited to
take part, and the details and results of
the trip or trips could not fail to be highly
interesting to chauffeurs and the public.
The great endurance and wide radius of
a good automobile would be clearly seen, j
The most powerful and speedy automobile
on the Pacific Coast is that of Charles L.
Fair, which is already here, though in the
hands of the customs officials. It is a
French machine of high power and cap
able of great speed. It is probable other
machines having powerful engines will be
brought to California.
Man and a Woman Attacked.
A young man giving his name as Ed
Hermann entered the Central Emergency
Hospital at 2 o'clock this morning, accom
panied by a young woman giving her
name as Miss Hamilton. Both were seek
ing treatment. Hermann was badly cut
and bruised about the face, and one of
the young woman's teeth had been
knocked out.
Hermann's story was that he was ac
companying Miss Hamilton home and
that at the corner of Fell and Franklin
streets three robbers attacked them Her
mann says he resisted and was knocked
down, $a,Deing taken from him. His com
panion had the tooth knocked out while
the men were trying to rob her.
Hermann says he fired a shot and his
companion blew a police whistle that she
had. Hermann says he believes he hit
one of the robbers, but the police could
find no wounded man.
Hermann lives near the entrance to the
Presidio.
Verdi Monument Fund.
The artists who have made the grand
opera season at the Tivoli such a grand
success will appear this afternoon in the
final matinee of the season. The proceeds
will be devoted to the benefit of the fund
to erect a monument to the memory of
the great composer, Verdi, -in this city
The curtain will be raised promptly at 2
o'clock and an excellent programme will
be rendered, consisting^ of gems from the

WEAKNESS
There Is no such condition as weakness la
a man under fifty years of age, other than gen-
eral debility. Prematurer.ess loss of vitality,
etc., are but â¢ymptoms of some damage to th*
reproductive system. In looking for ihe loca-
tion of this damage we generally flnn an en-
larged, swollen and inflamed prostate gland.
As this gland is the very center of the repro-
ductive system it can readily be understood
that inflammation of It must cause disordered
function. These cases are promptly benefited
by proper treatment, otherwise the patient goea
from bad to worse. The essential point In all
of them is the necessity of the cure of *.he focuÂ»
of the trouble In thÂ« prostate. Many men hayÂ«
unsuccessfully treated for a weakness and be-
come discouraged, when If an antiphlogistic
plan of treatment had been adopted instead of
tonics, a cure would have been the result. In
our experience there is no drug In the Phar-
macopeia, taken Into the stomach, that win
even benefit this class of cases. Oir Dlan of.
treatment Is entirely a local one and prompt
results are obtained, aa Indicated by increased
circulation and return of natural vl*or

Contracted Disorders.
Under the treatment pursued befor? irriga-

the duration of an acute contracted disorder.
If It proceeded beyond six weeks It wa.*
sidered to have gone Into chronic condition.
From statistics comslled from our oractlce In
the past five years, covering over 4500 cases.
we can show that 90 per cent of our patlentJ
have recovered In fourteen days or less. It Is.
therefore, equally proper to hold that a -as*
not entirely cured within two weeks must bÂ«
considered a chronic one, and some complica-
tion has arisen for which the patient should

on this subject, and offer an experience of ovÂ«r
twenty years: in fact, we can positively assert
that we have never failed to cure In a slnjl*

Precautions in Greater
New York Against
Fraud.
NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â Police Commis
sioner Murphy issued a general order to
the members of the police department to
day. In which he defines their duties on
election day and in which he directs them
to render to the State Superintendent of
Elections and his deputies assistance in.
the enforcement of the election laws. This,
together with a copy of the letter sent to
each officer, was forwarded to-day by
Murphy to Superintendent McCullagh. to
gether with a letter Â¦which is an answer
to the letter of Mr. McCullagn addressed
to the Commissioner a few days ago,
calling attention to statements that at
tempts would be made to vote illegally.
Murphy assured jMcCullagh that the po
lice would do everything in their power
to prevent illegal voting.
Both sides in the contest in Greater
New York to-night practically closed the
campaign as far as speaking is concerned.
Shepard and Low made their last
speeches, and the Fu.=loniÂ«=ts have an
nounced no more meetings. The Demo
crats, however, have several meeting*
scheduled for to-morrow (Sunday) night.
To-night immense meetings were" held by
both sides all over Greater New York.
Election betting in Wall street during
the two hours ot business was heavy in
volume and very brisk. Odds were for the
most part 10 to 8 and 10 to 9 on Low. The
two features of the betting, apart from
the volume of scattered bets, were the
large amount of Shepard money placed on
the Stock Exchange during the morning
and the large offers of Shepard money
both on the floor and "curb" just before
the close, with the result that the last
Mayoralty bet placed on the curb was
made at even money.
Activity in Ohio. .Â«
CINCINNATI, Nov. 2â On account of
the death of President McKinley the Ohio
campaign began at a much later date than
usual. The Republicans had their meet
ing October 19. and had eleven days of
campaigning. The Democrats opened their
campaign October 23, and had only eight
days. For this reason there will be some
meetings next Monday, notabiy the meet
ing to be addressed by Senator Hanna at
Klyria. Senator Hanna has been speak
ing several times each day since the Re
publican opening and Governor Nash has
done likewise. During the past week Sen
ator Foraker, who is a candidate for re
election In this campaign, has traveled
by special trains and addressed the people
along his route between the hours of his
afternoon and evening rallies. In addition
to the State candidates, Senators and
Congressmen, the Republicans have had
many speakers from other States, includ
ing Speaker Henderson and several Con
gressmen. '
The Democratic speakers have been lim
ited to Colonel Kilbourne and his asso
ciates on the Democratic State ticket and
other Ohio speakers. There have been no
speakers from other States on the stump
Early in the campaign it was proposed to
have ex-Senator Hill of New York Then
others wanted Colonel Bryan. Then it
was decided that neither of these distin
guished Democrats would participate in
the campaign and the conservative policy
was also extended to Ohio speakers, so
that Democrats who had been prominent
either as gold or silver advocates were not
assigned in the speaking canvass. John
R. McLean, the Democratic candidate
against Governor Nash two years ago. has
made no speeches. It has been reported
ever since the Democratic speaking cam
paign opened that he would be in Ohio
very soon, but up to to-night he is still in
"Washington, and the discussion among
the Democrats and Republicans regard-
Ing his attitude is a feature of the cam
paign. None of the Democratic Congress

WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â Commissioner

the principal steamship and railroad lines
of Canada for the regulation of immigra
tion to the United States through Canada.
This agreement, which takes the place of
the arrangement which expired three

vorable to the United States than the
last one, and will be much better in keep
ing out the prohibited classes of Immi
grants.
It provides that aliens arriving in Can
ada, destined to the United States, shall
be inspected at Halifax, N. S., Quebec,
Point Louisa, Vancouver, St. John, N. 8.,
and Victoria, B. C, by United States Com
missioners, who shall Issue certificates to
such as are fitted to enter this country
and the holders of these certificates Bhall
be entitled to enter the United States at
any of the above named places without
further examination. The examinations
at this point shall be similar to those con
ducted at the ports of the United States.
AU aliens adjudged Inadmissible shall be
returned to Uie countries from which they
came by the lines bringing them over.
men In Ohio have participated In the
speaking except Dr. J. A. Norton, who
was called out when the campaign was
opened in his district. It is supposed that
ex-Congressman Lentz, who is a neighbor
of Colonel Kilbourne at Columbus, offered
his services, but he was not given any as
signments.
The contest this year is squarely, be-
I tween the Republicans and the Demo

"at 237 Twelfth street, is sched
"uled for to-night. The occasion
will be the thirty-seventh anni
versary of the organization of the so
ciety, and everything In the line of en
tertainment that the members of the or
ganisation can devise for the pleasure of
the invited guests will be utilized.
Since the hall has been renovated It is
one of the best places of entertainment In
the city. New electrical appliances have
been Installed, end It is proposed to make
use of them as a special feature on the
opening night. The programme, consist-
Ing of a large number of entertaining
specialties, has been arranged with great
TERRIBLE DEATH
OF A SALESMAN
Henry Rosenblum, a salesman for Ro
senthal & Co., manufacturers' agents, 226
Bush street, was Instantly killed yester
day morning- while trying- to escape from
a runaway elevator in that building.
Shortly after 8 o'clock Rosenblum and
Miss Josie Godfrey, who works In the
same building, got into the elevator on
the ground floor, Edward Rigney of 356
Chestnut street In charge. When the sec
ond floor was reached the elevator passed
from the control of the boy and he was
unable to stop it. Rigney shouted to Ro
senblum and Miss Godfrey that the ele
vator was running away and would carry
them through the roof, and they became
panic-stricken. When the third floor was
reached the boy and Rosenblum attempt
ed to shove open the sliding door on that
floor, and in doing so Rosenbltim's head
and shoulders were caught between the
door and the floor of the cage and he was
jammed in bo small a space that when the
fourth floor was reached the elevator
came to a standstill, the body serving as
a brake. The girl had fainted and the boy
aroused the inmates of the building with
his screams.
A squad of firemen were summoned anrl
they worked for nearly an hour before
they succeeded in extricating the dead
body of Rosenblum.
Rigney was arrested and was afterward
released. He explained the accident by
saying that the elevator, which was
driven by electricity, got out of order and
the rope slackened so that he lost all con
trol of it. When they came to the third
floor he caught hold of the door to open
it, but Rosenblum caught hold of his
hand, opened the door himself, and sprang
out. The elevator, which was moving all
the time, caught him and jammed him
against the shaft.
dosed to-night. The Republican State
Central Committee estimates that the
vote will be in the neighborhood of 450,000
and that the Republicans will have about
75,000 plurality on the State ticket. The
Democrats do not concede this and say
the plurality will not be much greater
than 40,000. There is an unknown quan
tity in the situation this year. The pro
hibition Republicans, especially those of
the Methodist persuasion, are dissatisfied
with the nomination of Cummins for
Governor on account of his well known
anti-prohibition record, and will either
vote the prohibition ticket or not at all.
This disaffection may swell the Prohibi
tion vote to 20,000 or more.
SIOUX FALLS, S. D., Nov. 2.â The elec
tions in South Dakota on Tuesday will be
confined to the selection of eight District
Judge? and the settlement of purely local
questions. The Republicans and Fusloh
ists have opposing candidates In all ex
cept the Sixth Judicial District, where
jthe Fusionists made no nomination It
is generally conceded that the Republi
cans will win in all districts except the
third, fifth and thirteenth, where both
sides make claims, with odds inifavor of
the Republicans. A very light Vote will
be polled.
In Nebraska and Kansas.
LINCOLN. Neb., Nov. 2.â The dullest
campaign known in Nebraska for ten
years practically came to a close to-day.
The vote will probably show a falling off
of 35,000 compared with a year ago. The
apathy among the rank and file is limited
to ro particular party, but was considered
up to a week ago to be most pronounced
among the Populists, who are, as usual
fused with the Democrats on the three
State officers to be elected. This apathy,
it is claimed, has in a measure been coun
teracted by the vigorous campaign which
William J. Bryan has been conducting for
the past ten days in the eastern and cen
tral counties. Mr. Bryan, while paying
some attention to national issues, has
made special appeal for a continued close
alliance between the Democrats and Pop
ulists.
Over signed statements. Chairman dc
France of the Populists and Chairman
Scott of the Democrats claim the election
of the fusion ticket by 10,000 to 15,000.
Chairman Lindsay said the Republican
plurality would be decisive. He declined
to give any figures.
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. 2.â A1l the coun
ties in Kansas will on Tuesday vote for
county and township officers. Tinder
the biennial election law, passed by
the last Legislature, all the regular
county officers will be voted for next
year. The election, though local, is in
teresting from the fact of it being the
first to be held under the anti-fusion law.
The Democrats and Populists after
much parrying have agreed to support
Democratic candidates. The Democrats
have thus advanced from third to second
place on the ticket. Strong efforts will be
made by both sides to carry the local
election, as the political complexion of the
next Legislature will depend very largely
on its outcome.
care and under able supervision.
Eight o'clock is the hour specified for
the curtain-raiser, but the guests will
have an opportunity to inspect the hail
for some time previous. As soon as th =
curtain rises the singing section will bo
heard in a song of welcome.
The turner section, the shooting section
and the singing section will then appear
in an allegorical tableau, after whicli
President John Hermann will deliver the
formal address of welcome. Another fea
ture will be a second tableau entitled
"The White Statue." Dancing will con
clude the evening's pleasures.
Seven hundred members of the Verem
Eintracht are interested in the success of
the celebration and will do all in their
power to make the guests of the evening
feel the full measure of unrestrained
German hospitality.

BAZAAR COMES TO AN END
St. Mary's Cathedral bazaar was visited
by an exceedingly large crowd last night,
when the festival was practically brought
to a close. There was no regular pro
gramme of entertainment, but the people
amused themselves by Inspecting and
purchasing the beautiful articles which
were offered for sale at the various

be deemed the banner night, as the large

MASKED ROBBER
QUICKLY CAUGHT
Policeman Dugan Boldly
Pursues and Takes
Highwayman.
Several Daring Hold-Ups Oc
cur in Various Parts
of the City.
While walking along Van Ness avenus,
near Jackson street, about 9 o'clock last
night Otto Fleissner, organist of the First
I Presbyterian Church, and Rex Hamlin, a
stenographer employed by the Standard
Oil Company, were held up by two
masked men, one of whom was armed
j with a revolver.
After being told to "line up" prepara
tory to being deprived of their valuables,
Fleissner suddenly took to his heels and
darted down Washington street. Hamlin
! wanted to follow him, but the pointed six
shooter caused him to remain in the high
waymen's company.
One of the robbers then searched him,
taking his purse, containing $2, a bunch
of keys ana a pocketknife. They theT
commanded him to "move on" under pen
i alty of death.
As soon as )>Â« got out of the sight of
i the robbers Fleissner went to the North
j End station, where he excitedly told th^
story of the hoid-up. Police Officer Dugaa
! happened to be present and he immediate
i ly started out to find the desperate pair.
Officer Fearlessly Pursues.
Scarcely had the officer emerged from
the station than he saw two men who
answered the description given of the
i highwaymen by the organist. Dugan ap
; preached them and as ne did so they ran
jin different directions. The officer fdl
j lowed one of them and after a short
I chase overtook him. He was taken to
the North End station and searched. The
purse and keys which they had taken
irom Fleissner were found in his shoe.
Fleissner was then sent for and on look
ing at the fellow positively identified him
as being one of the men who held up him
and his friend.
The prisoner, who is an ill-appearing in
dividual, gave his name as Frank Nelson
and claimed that he had recently come
from Colorado.
The other robber, up to a late hour last
night, had not been arrested.
Robert Dooley, alias Thompson, was ar
rested last nignt by Policemen H. Wilsoa
and M. T. Cooney and booked at the City
Hall station on a charge of robbery.
Dooley was pointed out to the officers
on Folsom ana Harriet streets by J. W.
Kramer, an employe of the Corporation
Yard, who claimed that he had* seen him
take a man into a doorway and rob him
When the prisoner was searched at the
station $80 in gold was found in his pock
ets and booked as evidence against him.
Aged Victim of Robber.
Later Detectives Regan and O'Connell
found an old man in the vicinity of the
robbery, who gave the name of Jame.; j
Hosie and claimed that he had been
robbed of more than $100 a short while
before. He was taken to the prison and
Dooley was brought before him. Hosio
positively identified Dooley as the man
who had robbed him.
An hour after Dooley's arrest Joseph
Bertram, residing at i>V 2 Columbia square,
called at the Southern station and hand
ed over $20 50 that he said had been !
picked up by hts sister, Mrs. Ross, in the j
doorway of her house at 1013V 2 Folsom !
street, where the robbery had taken
place.
Hosie is from Santa Rosa. He had been
drinking and had met Dooley in his trav
els.
James Roberts and Robert Galley, two
desperate-looking characters, were lodged
in the City Hall Station last night by Po
licemen ID. M. Owens and Robert Tobin and
charges of robbery and attempt to commit
robbery were placed against their names.
Early in the evening, at the corner of
Annie and Jessie streets, Robert K. Cloth
ier, a waiter, was approached by Roberts
and Galley, who solicited the price of a
meal. T'pon being denied one of the men i
threw his arm around Clothier's neck, and j
the other relieved him of $2 10. After ad- j
monishing Clothier at the point of a pis- !
tol to walk away and not to turn around :
the men left their victim.
Just a moment later, and but half a j
block away, the robbers encountered Â¦
George Dilllstone, a plumber, and at- j
tempted to rob him. They demanded the I
man's purse and Dilllstone, in taking it
from his pocket,' struck at them and yelled
loudly for help.
Attracted by the cries the officers |
reached the scene in time to arrest both I
men. At this time Clothier made his ap- â¢
pearance, told of his experience and iden- !
tlfled the prisoners as the men who had
robbed him.

MISS BONNIE DELANO
Â» '- - - * Â¦ *___ __2â â â
A Chicago Society Lady, v in a Letter
to Mrs. Pinkham, says:
"Of All the Grateful Daughters' to Whom Ton" Have
Given Health and Life None Are '
More Glad Than I"
Â£
What a reward for honest effort it is to receive such grateful acknowledg-
ment as is represented in Miss Delano's letter ; yet that letter, good as it is
and prominent in social life as is its writer, is only one of thousands which
Mrs. Pinkham is constantly receiving from women in all parts of the country
who have been restored to health and happiness, and the reason is easily
guessedâ there is not a day, nay, scarcely an hour, when Lydia E. Pink-
' ham's Vegetable Compound is not bringing health and happiness back
into the life and home of some poor suffering girl or woman, who out of the
gladness and fulness of her heart hastens to write Mrs. Pinkham and tell her
all about it. . " > ;^ . ; 5!
MISS BONNIE DELANO.
"Dear Mrs. Pixkham: âOf all the grateful daughters to whom
you have given health and life, none are more glad than I.
" My home and ray life was happy until illness came upon me three
years ago. I first noticed it by being irregular and having very painful
and scanty menstruation ; gradually my general health failed ; I could
not enjoy my meals ; I became languid and nervous, with griping pains
frequently in the groins.
"I advised with our family physician who prescribed, but without any
improvement. One day he said, â 'TryLyclia Piukham's Remedies.'
I did, thank God the next month I was better, and it gradually built
me up until in four months I was cured. This is nearly a year ago and
I have not had a pain or ache since." â Bonnie Delano, 3248 Indiana
Aye., Chicago, 111.
The sure help for all ailing women is liydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound. Women who have used it testify to this with one
voice.
. When the periods are painful or too frequent ; when the backache*
and headaches Â¦ drive out all j ambition ; when the heart-breaking,
" dragged-down " sensation attacks you, when you are so nervous that
every trivial thing excites you, you may be certain that there is some
growing trouble fastening itself upon you. Do not let disease make
headway. Write to Mrs. Pinkham, Lynn, Mass., for her free advice,
and begin at once the use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound.
Trustworthy proof is abundant that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound saves thousands of young women from dangers resulting from
organic irregularity, suppression or retention of the menses, ovarian or womb
troubles. What will cure the mother will cure the daughter, for their organ-
ism is the same and governed by the same laws. <*

Reception to Mrs. Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 2.â
The elaborate reception tendered to Mrs.
Stanford in honor of her return home
from two years' travel abroad occurred
in the large clubroom of Encina Hall, the
men's dormitory, this afternoon, and was
in every respect a social success.
The spacious clubroom lends itself to
decoration particularly well, but at no
other function has it ever appeared as
superbly beautiful as it did to-day. Pro
fessors, instructors and faculty ladles
worked with a will until the clubroom.
receptions rooms and staircases were
turned into bowers of roses, geraniums
and evergreens. The bamboos which grow
so abundantly in the garden plats in the
quadrangle were used profusely in the

COMMENT UPON MR.
ROSSI'S PAINTINGS
Mr. Charles Dlckman, the artist, tells Mr.
Rossi of the P. Rossi Company, Sutter street,
that he was misquoted by the Examiner ln
reference to the paintings now on sale at the
antique furniture store. This Is what he really
did say:
"In the P. RoÂ«sl Company 1 ! collection of
European paintings there are several can-
vases worthy of special mention. The water
colors by Simonettl are cleverly handled, a
good composition and well handled. The Bec-
carla, a small interior of the Rembrandt type,
la among the beet pictures in the exhibition.
Goceda's Napla Temple Is good ln tone and
exquisitely finished. Lazerges has a caravan
picture above his average. Paolettl's canvas
is a strong example of the Italian school of his
time, and Lanza's Venetian picture is a good
example of this artist's work."
Mr. Nellson, the water color artist, has some
r^roerks to make:
"From the broad impressionistic treatment
of Italico Brass to the finely finished work of
Gio Paoletti there are many phases of tech-
nique and wide diversity of subject. A beau-
tifully painted picture by Maco, full of sun-
shine and animation. Is an excellently handled
and attractive piece of work. A fine water
color by Slmonetti shows to what a remark-
able degree of finish' a water color may be
carried, and this artist's masterly rendering
of textures and delicate harmonies ln color are
well brought out ln 'The Snake Charmer.'
In contrast to the sunny vivacity and bright
coloring of Oasparinl is an old painting (un-
signed) that reminds one by its low, mellow
tones and dark, transparent shadows, of Rem-
brandt. "The Writer,' by Paoletti, is a beau-
tiful piece of work of the old school, and the
rich, low tones and fine mqdellng ln this com-
position reveal the master hand of this great
painter.
"The work of Beauquesne is above criticism,
and the unquestioned merit depicted In the
canvas by Lazerges needs no comment. Por-
tielje's painting of a Moorish head naturally
attracts attention. Many other paintings by
well-known artists are contained ln this col-
lection."

gives the information that the California
Naval Militia can supply to such reserve
thirty-three officers, nine warrant officers,
five chief petty officers and 400 men.
If the proposition to establish and main
tain a national reserve is adopted it would
not interfere with the State Naval Mili

reserve until after three years' service in
the State Naval Militia.

HEW BELIEF BOARD \
HAS BEEN ORGANIZED
Foresters of America Adopt a New
Method of Caring for the
Sick.
The new feature of the sick benefit plan
of the Foresters of America., which In
this city has a membership of nearly 7000,
has been the organization of a board of
relief. In the past it has been the rule
of this order when a member of the or
der from the interior came to this city
and was taken sick, or was in distress, to
report himself to the grand secretary 0*
the order, who would assign his case to
some court in the local jurisdiction. If it
happened that a court did not meet on
the evening of the day assistance was ap
plied for delay followed.
The new organization, like the Odd Fel
lows' board of relief, proposes to be In
session at all times and be ready at a
moment's notice to render such aid as
may be required by an unfortunate
brother.
For the purpose of bringing the new
branch of the order before the member
ship and the public, a grand entertain
ment and dance will be given in Native
Sons' Hall on the night of December 3.
and the following named have been ap
pointed to make the necessary arrange
ments:
S. Schweitzer of Court Washington. J.
Bacon of Court Justice. T. E. Gibbon of
Court El Dorado. G. A. Sullivan of Court
America and C. \V. Brown of Court Pre
sidio.
It is announced by scientists that fem
inine mustaches are on the Increase, and
that the close of the century will find
bearded women common sights.

who committed the murder. He says that
he was a friend of Anderson and had
warned him to desist in his attentions to
a woman in Winters whose name he de
clines for the present to mention. He

away from her home on penalty of being
killed by a relative of hers. He states

habit of wearing his (Young's) clothing
and that the latter had been In a fight a

portant developments on that day.

hours during the rainstorm of lasc
week. So violent was It that it ap
peared as if giant hands had sought to
change the aspect of the country. Fortu
nately the cyclone raged over a strip of
country which is little inhabited, else loss
of life must have followed.
Great pine trees were torn out of the
ground by the roots and thrown Into tho
air. Hundreds are found many yards
from the places where they had stood.
Broken trunks of trees are piled across
the roads, forming blockades In many
places. It will take many days for woods
men with saws to open the roads again
"Where the trees grew thick the storm
swept a clean path through the forest.
Even the birds could not escape, so sud
den was the blast, as Is shown by the
dead ones found.
Sections of board fences were swept
completely away, and even the barbed
wire fences were torn down. It is thought
that some cattle were killed and some
empty cabins were demolished. By a
strange coincidence, the same section was
visited by a similar cyclone last winter,
I and a passing stage was turned bottom
side up and a young lady passenger waa
badly hurt.

EASTERN MARKETS,
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â The stock market was
spotty and irregular to-day, but made a firm
closing at about the best, generally after the
appearance of the weekly bank statement.
Very large orders were placed in various stocks
to effect the rally. The selling was after the
bank statement had been considered and the
earlier gains had been pretty well wiped out.
Union Pacific was most prominent in the rally
and was marked up to 103>4 through many
offerings of several thousand share blocks each.
The Southern Railway stocks. Baltimore and
Ohio, Amalgamated Copper and United States
Steel preferred also rallied strongly, the last
named rising a point over last night. St.
Paul was notably heavy and rallied but feebly,
dropping back to the lowest of the day just
at the close. The general movement was nar
row, but some less important stocks moved
widely. People's Gas was sharply depressed.
There was strength in Illinois Central and the
St. Louis and San Francisco stocks. It was
hoped that the gold exports, coming late in
the week, would not figure for their full
amount in the bank statement under the aver
age system. But the cash decrease proved to
be $1,500,000 in excess -of the estimates. The
loan item showed the prospects of loan ex
pansion by the banks still heavy In force. The
London money market showed relief by redis
bursement o: November dividends and sterling
at Paris recovered a fraction. Further gold
exports frrni New York next week are counted
ay a practical certainty. The strong rally in
Union Pacific at the close was accompanied
by rumors that a statement of the terms of
the Northern Pacific settlement was a- possibil
ity before trading was resumed on Monday.
Prices of stocks have drifted uncertainly
during the whole of the past week, with no
consistent movement denned at anytime. The
conflicting eddies in the pool of
have been due to movements of individual
stocks under the influence of special Causes.
The prevailing impression among market ob
servers has been one of dullness near to the
record Sow l>-veL For the first time this year
the weekly transactions in stocks have fallen
below the aggregate transactions for the cor
responding period last year during one of the
weeks of October, yet a survey of the transac
tions of the whole month reveals an aggregate
of $14,023,147. compared with a total of $10,900,
â¢ October of last year, which was in tura
the largest aggregate of transactions for any
October in the previous ten years. Sales of
bonds for October Just ended amounted to a
par value of HMM.MO. compared with $42,297,-
October of last year and $59*847,980 in
Octor* It will be seen therefore that
the sensation of dullness is due to the con
trast with the furious activity of the specu
lative furor of the earlier part of the year,
when the dally transactions ran from 1,000,0 "
to 3,000,000 shares a day for many consecutive
days. It is true, however, that speculative
operation* have fallen to a low ebb and are
left almost wholly in the hands of professional
opera I
The multiplication of securities listed and
dealt in by their expanded share issues ac
counts for the maintenance of the amount of
business in the stock market above any pre
vious record for the corresponding time of the
year. The usual withdrawals of banking de
poFits for active circulation In the course of the
crop movement makes this nominally a period
of dullness in speculation. The fostering cause
of speculative activity is the accumulation of
idle reserves in the banks, wnlch are employed
by the average speculator in the form of loans
on call.
It is found to be the invariable rule that a
demand for money for mercantile and indus
trial pur)<oses works a contraction of the sup
ply available for speculative purposes on call,
no matter what the ruling in the rate for call
loans may amount to. Thus, in December,
Â¦ hen the war In the Transvaal broke out,
demand for call loans for speculative commit
ments on the Stock Exchange ran the rate up
to IS6 per cent per annum and precipitated a
severe panic, but did not check the outgo of
sold to London. Speculation is therefore nat
urally timid in times of strong currents in the
shifting of money supplies. Opinions continue
to vary as to what will be the ultimate direc
tion of values when speculation issues from
its present dormant and hesitating condition.
The aggregate requirements of foreign money
markets until the turn of the year are still
undefined and the events of the week point
to the likelihood that the New York money
market will be called upon to meet those re
quirements. The beginning of gold exports In
Paris and the advanced Bank of England dis
count rate point clearly to the conclusion. The
ability of foreign markets to command gold
fr'>m New York in face of the heavy trade bal
ance in our favor for many months is now
seen to be due to the enormous return of for
eign holdings of securities to domestic holders
and large borrowings by home capitalists and
syndicates during the struggle for control of
the Northern Pacific and the organization of
the United States Steel Corporation. The pro
longation of the Boer war keeps Europe shut
oft* from Its customary source of gold supply,
while the continued production in this country
makes it the most available source of supply.
Industrial depression In Germany and in Rns
sia have involved heavy losses. French capital
having been heavily committed in Russia. This
la held to account for the calling home of
French capital.
There have been suggestions also that for
eign capitalists have not entirely approved of
the uses to which their money was put by the
borrowine from capitalists and syndicates here.
The depression abroad Is already reflected in a
degree in the decline in our exports and In
the increased competition for surplus products
and lower prices and the question obtains how
much further this tendency may go.
Attention has been attracted this week by
reports of retirement from business of wheat
exporters on account of disappointing foreign
demand and collapsed ship carrying rates, so
that speculative contracts both In wheat and
ocean freights have Involved losses.
The oxport of Iron products has avowedly
fallen to insignificant proportions, although the
urgent demands of the home trade are given
to account for this. It is one of the many
anomalies of the foreign exchange situation
that London has to shift the Paris demand for
gold on New York, while Australian gold is
diverted from Its usual course to London for
shipment to San Francisco and ultimately to
New York. The week's shipment of $2,850,000
to Paris is exactly counterbalanced by gold re
ceived In New York or in transit from Aus
tralia. The recall of bond purchases by the
Secretary of the Treasury only partly relieved
the tension of the disturbing effect upon the
money market for the unwieldy Government
surplus. Opinion Is not well defined as to
whether or not the country's prosperous condi
tions and prospects are not overcapitalized on
the basis of the large financial organizations
of the past year, notably the "Burlington"
deal, the United States Steel Corporation and
the general high level of prices for securities
still prevailing.
Railroad bonds have been quite active during
the week, with points of notable strength here
and there.

Weekly Bank Statement.
NEW YORK. Nov. 2.â The statement of the

shows:
Loans, $891,922,900; Increase $7,333 200
Deposits, $95Â»,062,400: increase, $3,566,300
Circulation, $31,875,900; increase, $112 700'

Reserve required, $239,515,600; Increase, '$891 -
E75. '
Surplus. $10,482,800; decrease. $4 230 375
The Financier says: The bank statement was
made on rising averages for cash, there having
been a payment on Friday by the sub-treasury
of about $1,000,000 for bonds, the purchase of
which was made under the order of October
31. Early next week at least $1,000,000 will be
raid for Yukon gold to the Bank of British
North America, and unless this money Is
shipped to Canada or to Europe it will remain
on deposit In our banks. It will be observed
that the increase in loans continue unchecked
there having been a gain In this Item since
September 21 aggregating $26,973,700. Inas
much as neither the Stock Exchange require
ments nor mercantile borrowings will account
for this increase It seems most likely due to
forelgnNexchange operations and to negotiations
of loans upon securities by syndicates The
purchase of unmatured bonds by the treasury
which began on Friday last, will .probably
tend somewhat to Increase the cash holdings
of the banks and possibly to such an extent
as to counterbalance moderate withdrawals for
shipment to Europe. Should the foreign de
mand for gold be large, however, it can scarcely
fail to have an Important Influence on the bank
reserves, at least until currency shall return
In volume from the Interior. It should be
noted that while the gold withdrawn for ship
ment is a direct loss to the New York banks
all the money paid for unmatured bonds does
not remain in those Institutions, a pait thereof
being distributed throughout the interior and
a considerable portion going Into savings banks
in return for the bonds they have sold. Hence
the New York banks are likely to lose largely
should gold exports continue.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. 2.â Corn ruled easier early in
the short session, December opening %@%c
lower, at 57% cto 57% con weaker cables. There
was still present that disposition to take prof
its that brought a sag in this pit yesterday and
there was liberal selling all around both by
shorts and by traders who wanted to clear up
for Sunday. Commission people, however, held
big buying orders and when attempts were
made to till them and nothing was found 00
the market the bull clique began operations
and shoved December up to 58%@59%c. There
was a good cash demand outside, and receipts
were still light. December closed strong, %c
advanced, at 58% c.
Wheat had a dull, narrow market, easy dur
ing the early part of the session and aided at
the close by the bulge in corn. December
opened a shade to '/sfcUc lower, at 70% cto
70% con weaker cables, heavy receipts and a
desire to liquidate over Sunday. Prices even
eased oft a shade as a result of an absence of
any outside interest. Primary receipts were
almost double those of last week and world's
statistics promised to be bearish Monday, but
in spite of this depression, when the rise In
corn came wheat Immediately responded and
closed %@%c higher, at 70% c.
Oats were dull and steady, following the lead
of corn. December closed firm, %@%c higher,
at 36%@36%c.
Provisions had a dull, dragging market on
lower prices for hogs. There was some special
pressure on the lower opening, but enough was
offered in the face of a limited demand to keep
prices down. January pork closed 2%c lower,
lard 2%c down and ribs 2%c higher.

SELECTS GROUP
PLAN FOR ORES
Mineralogist Arranging
for Educational Ex
hibition. *
Another Dredger Is About
to Search for Long-
Hidden Gold.
State Mineralogist Aubury has a plan
for the improvement of the State Mining
Museum, in the ferry building in this city.
His general theory is that the inquirer
for any metal does not get much of an
idea of its wide distribution in the State
by being compelled to hunt through all
the county exhibits for it. The county
collections he proposes to rearrange so
that there shall be collective exhibits of
various metals, copper, gold, silver, etc.,
respectively. The specimens will still be
credited to the localities that produce
them. Ordinarily speaking the inquirer
for information about any particular
proposition "Will not go searching through
ail the cases in tne museum, one after an
other, but he would look at an the sam
ples if there were only the copper speci
tueaa m one pia.ce, gold |in auutner and
so on.
This is in accordance with the plan of
segregation adopted in the mining bul
letins that the present mineralogist is
Issuing or about to issue. Instead of hay-
Ing a large number of metals and mis
cellaneous information treated in one
large pamphlet, where one must search
ror what He wishes to know about, there
are special bulletins to treat the leading
metais separately, copper and quicksilver
leading the way in the list.
The .Redding Free Press reports that the
dredger that Michigan parties have nearly
completed for operating on the river at
Midaie Creek will be a novelty in several
respects. The machine is to be used to
seeK for the gold that has swept down the
creek for many years of mining and has
lodged in the sand at the bottom of eddies
ana nooks where the creek debouches into
the river. In the dredger there is no
dipper or scoop attached to a swinging
arm. A diver goes down in his diving suit
and" finds the spot to be worked. The
barge is moved over the site and Is fas
tened. In the center of the barge is an
iron cylinder thirty inches in diameter and
twenty feet long. This is sunk through
the barge until the end rests on the bot
tom of the river. A man climbs inside,
a rubber cap is fitted over the top and
the engine forces in air. The air in turn
forces all the water out of the cylinder
and the man descends to the bottom with
his small shovel and deep bucket. When
the bucket is filled with the sediment it
is sent up. ' Thus the miner works freely
in the bottom sands without the water
disturbing him in the least.
A Find of Feldspar.
W. T. Brooks sends to the Los Angeles
Mining Review a report of the existence
of large bodies of feldspar, a potassium
ore, in Southern California, which con
tains a large percentage of potash. This
character of ore has hitherto been found
chiefly in Norway and Sweden, but it is
supposed that there is a chance for this
country now to compete In supplying the
markets of the world. Well denned fis
sure veins, free from foreign matter and
In bodies varying from three to forty-two
feet, so Brooks says, have been discov
ered and they contain 14 per cent of pot
ash. 16 per cent of aluminum and 70 per
cent of silicon. A part of Brooks' com
munication follows:
We have made a most thorough Investiga
tion of the quantity and quality of ore, . and
the expense of extracting the valuable chemi
cal potassium, used in the manufacturing of
such everyday, and universally used articles of
commerce as cyanide of potassium, the fer
tilizers, glass, gunpowder and the phosphates,
chlorates and so forth, of potash. The salts
of potassium for medical purposes may be
stated to be simply innumerable, and I feel
that I am fully warranted In making the above
statement as being absolutely correct, fearless
of successful contradiction, though it may in
part be reluctantly accepted for reason that
potassium ores in solid bodies have not been i
heretofore found in profitable quantities and
qualities in the United States.
The Calaveras Prospect says that the
old Calaveras group of mines on Indian
Creek promise to again become bullion
producers on a large scale. For many
years the mines . were worked as
a free â gold proposition, no at
tempts being made to save the
s>ulpburets. Despite that the showing
made was good, there was some bad
management and finally the old mill burn
ed down and work in the mines was aban
doned. The upper levels had been pretty
well worked out and the Calaveras group
presented a bad appearance. Recently a
new company has taken hold of the prop
erty and a cyanide plant has been erected
to work over the old tailings that remain
on the ground. This work is well ad
vanced. While this has been going on
the property has been unwatered and
prospecting has been resumed.
The cyanide tanks at the Oro Minlo

of the old Calaveras group. The Beat

been augmented.
Mines Change Owners.
The Redding Searchlight reports that
the Three Sisters mine on Â¦ Dutch Gulch,
one and a half miles from the town of
French Gulch, has been bonded by Ellery
Bros, to Volney Fox and others for $10,
00, the option running eighteen months.
This is a gold quartz property that was
formerly worked quite extensively. Â¦'..'-
The Lappin mine in Trinity County,
near Deadwood, has been sold. The first
payment has been made. The former
owners were J. F. Tourtellotte, R. F.
Cochran and M. A. Brady. The purchas
ers are Eastern people, who were repre
sented by J. K. Fleming. The report is
driven out that the price was more than
$100,000.
The Calaveras Chronicle reports that
twenty-eight men are working at the
Jones mine. Three shifts are sinking the
shaft. The property was operated under
bond by a Boston company for a while,
but has since been purchased in view of
developments. The owners of the After
thought mine are making good progress
in the development of that property.
Sinking and drifting are about to be vig
orously pushed at the Poorman mine.
The Conradi mine is being opened up by
a San Jose company. , . ,
There is considerable interest in nickel
mining in Oregon. Nickel ledges have
been reopened in the Cow Creek district.
Several large nuggets of the free metal,
according to the Oregonian, have also
been picked up in the Canyon Creek coun
try in the southern part of Josephine
County. The deposits were discovered
several years ago upon a steep hillside.
Nothing was done then except to ?sink
shafts and to run short drifts. Arrange
ments that were made at one time to work
the deposits on a large scale were never
carried through, but the Eastern people
who use nickel largely have recently be
come interested, among the number being
Thomas A. Edison. Prospecting will be
pursued, says the Oregonian, in the hope
of locating the original veins. Oregon
nickel was exhibited at Buffalo.
Thomas Ewing tells the Los Angeles
Herald that good times are in store for
Needle*, owing to the busy work of
the miners in Southern Nevada and Ari
zona. In Mohave County, Ariz., the in
terest seems to center in the Gold Roads
and Boundary Cone districts. People are
at work In all sections . developing their
properties. There is a proposition under
consideration, bo Ewing says, to build a
railroad from Needles in a northerly di
rection into the Gold Roads district. The
population of Needles will be .largely in
creased by the many camps that are now
working. . Â¦Â¦ - -Â¦-:.':, â¢
New Copper District.
The new Blackfoot district, near Helena,
Mont., is about to be developed for -cop
per by Senator W. A. Clark. He has
taken a bond for $100,000 on the Ophir
group at old Blackfoot City from Mitchell
& Hird of Spokane and also has an op
tion on the Carey group in the same vicin
ity, the latter bond being for $50,000. The
Ophlr property is developed by a shaft to
the depth of 110 feet and several cross
cuts have been made which show, accord
ing to v the reports received, â¢ that it car
ries coper*ln an ore similar to that found
at Butte. The. great : copper operators of
the Butte districts are reported to be look
ing for copper Â¦ all over Montana. Until
recently little attention had been paid to
the indications near Helena. Shafts are
now going deep in a dozen places, so says

UKIAH BOARD BILL IS
CAUSE OF JACOBS' ARREST
H. C. JÂ§*cobs, a solicitor for a number
of firms engaged in enlarging photo
graphs, was arrested in this city on Fri
day afternoon and taken yesterday to
Ukiah on a charge of defrauding an inn
keeper. Jacobs has been traveling through
Mendocino and Sonoma counties and made
his headquarters at the Palace Hotel,
where, it is alleged, he contracted a bill of
$175 for the board and lodging of himself
and wife.
O. E. Williams, the proprietor of the ho
tel, swore to the complaint, and the war
rant was served by Deputy Sheriffs W. F.
Ornbaun and Charles J. Ellis. Jacobs left
Ukiah three weeks ago and has been in
the southern part of the State. He re
turned on Thursday night and intended to
leave again for the south In a day or two.
It is. claimed by the arresting officers
that Jacobs left his wife penniless in
Ukiah, and that he wrote her a few weeks
ago to get her trunk out of the hotel and
meet him in San Francisco. His wife,
they Bay, refused to be a party to the
scheme, as she had heard, that he had ar
ranged to take away with him the wife
of a resident of Ukiah.
It is said also by the arresting officers
that Jacobs has been taking orders for
enlarged pictures, receiving deposits vary
ing from $5 to $25, and that the people who
paid these deposits have not received the
pictures. The amount of his receipts from
this source is said to be between $1500 and
$2000. After the Mendocino County author
ities get through with Jacobs he will be
turned over to those of Sonoma County.

Obtained Candy by False Pretenses.
John Sldeman, a lad of 16 years, living
at 66 Rausch street, Is locked up In the
City Prison on the complaint of F. E.
Lake, a confectioner at 137 Powell street.
The Sideman ocy has during the past few
months depleted the candy stores about
the city by presenting bogus orders for
candy and chewing gum, which he dis
posed of at reduced prices to small stores
and street customers. Yesterday he en
tered the store of Lake and obtained a
supply on an order from some person sup
posed to have a store in the Mission.
Lake questioned the lad's honesty, as he
had heard of his methods. He followed
him to Market street, where he notified
Officer A. J. Nolting of his suspicions and
had the boy placed under arrest on the
charge of obtaining goods by false pre
tenses.
Bey. Fay Mills Will Lecture.
The Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills opens his
series of free lectures to-night at Metro

sublime. The regalia worn ;by the team
of - Industrial was magnificent, and it is
safe to say has never been excelled In any
lodge In this State. All , the officers were

VITAL ISSUES
FACE OIL MEN
Directors of Associated
Company Moving
With Care.
Situation at Los Angeles
Affects Producers and
Market.
The leading interest cf the men engaged
in California's oil industry now attache*
to tho work of the directors of the Asso- â¢
ciated Oil Company, who have beep con
ferring in this city during- the last week.
In the success of the combination that UÂ»
I proposed as. a part of their plan, the ac
tive producers of oil north of Tehachapl
are vitally concerned. A majority of the
leading companies in the Kern and Mc
; Kittrlek districts are represented upon
i the Board' of Directors. The general
j trend of the work of the' directors ha 3
j shown that they are proceeding witn
care. Â .., â¢ ' '..
The Bakersfield Calif ornian says that a
pipe-line from the present terminus- of the
Sunset railroad to section 34. 12, 24 m the
Sunset District has the backing of people
who are largely interested in ,the oil in
dustry, and that the preliminary surveys
for the line have been made. The propo
sition is to reach the best part of the ter
ritory and to .jive an outlet to the rail
load direct. . '"' . '
It is expected that .the refinery at Ba
kersfield now under construction for the
Pacific Refining Company will be in run
ning order, by the nrst of the coming
year. Soon after that it will be turning
out large quantities of refined oil ! and
asphalt. A spur track of the â¢ Santa Â»**
has been laid. to it. . At first oil will be
brought directly by rail from the Kern
River, Sunset and McKlttrick districts,
but will probably be- piped after a time
to save expense. The plant is considera
bly lower than the oil wells, so that tha
piping could be accomplished with com
parative ease, especially If distillates, are
used to. thin the oil.
A great deal of space has been devoted
by the Los Angeles papers to the narra
tion of the troubles that the oil producers
of the Los Angeles field have had over
their agreements concerning the market
| ing of oil. When the president of the Oil
Producers' Association committee wrote
to Ed Strasburg, president of the Oil
Storage and Transportation Company ,
suggesting certain changes In the con
tract with the Storage and Transporta- .
tion Company, Strasburg replied In sub
stance as follows:
We still believe thÂ« contract as origin
ally prepared by us to be a good working con
tract for both parties, and would be pleased to
handle the oil of as many producers in the
Lea Angeles field as would be willing to have
us sell their oil under the tame. Instead of
the- Storage Company selling a certain num
ber of barrels of oil per month now belonging
to themselves, we propose changing that clause
for us not to sell any of our oil until July 1.
1902, provided we secure oil enough under such
contracts to supply our - requirements. * After
which time we would want the privilege o*
disposing of all of the oil we might have on
! hand at 1 tha rate of 5000 barrels -per month.
! This would give the producers who give us
their oil to handle the benefit of all contracts
we now have.
Now Act as Individuals.
According to the Los Angeles Herald
there were representatives of 268 wells at
the meeting when this letter was read.
The result of the deliberations was that
i while as a united body of producers the
| association Is dead the organization was
maintained for the present. A resolution
I was adopted in which the right of the in
dividual well owner to sign with the
' Storage and Transportation Company was
I conceded. Some of the producers signed
I the same day with the Storage and Trans
portation-Company, the contract to take
effect November 1. President Strasburg
said that if a sufficient number of pro
i ducers came in his company would act as
i sole agent and would refrain from, doing
any other than the business of the sign
ers. If, however, a sufficient number
i failed to come In the Storage and Trans-
I portation people would reserve the right
i to get what business they could upon the
outside. . Each month the producers and
their agent will meet to fix the price of
oil, but the Storage Company will be the
sole judge as to selling and no committee
will be given power to sell the oil of pro
ducers on the outside. On the day of the
! meeting and the following day between.
20,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil were pledged
to the Storage and Transportation Com
: pany by the local producers. Concerning
i the new arrangement the Los Angeles
Herald says:
Without doubt any one choosing to be hyper
critical can pick holes In the contract, for It
one or the other of the contracting parties
desires only to observe the letter while ignor
i Ing the spirit of the instrument, there is scope
I left for some sharp practice. But difficulties
! of this kind the law, however rigidly it be

/ Search for New Field. \
f The Western Oil and Development Com
: pany is drilling sixteen miles from any
i producing well, being just north of Buena
vista Lake, and the operations are
watched with interest, for there is a possi
bility that a new field will be developed.
The drill is reported to be down some
thing more than BCO feet. -
i The Pacific Oil Reporter says that It has
1 become evident that the life of the Texas
oil wells Is exceedingly short and that
, the Texas oil Is of an inferior quality.
For these reasons there la no justifica
j tion for anxiety on the part of the Califor
nia producers because of any competition
that â¢ may come from. Texas. The same
journal predicts that refining oil will bring
more wealth to the State than will fuel oil.
California ought to be exporting immense
, quantities of refined oil to Japan. The.
j following Instance is given as illustrative
l^of this claim. , . ; â¢'/
The British ship Falgrav* a few days â¢ ago
sailed from Philadelphia for Japan with 130,000.
cases of refined petroleum. At the same time
there were loading or under charter to 'load
tor the land of the Mikado sixteen vessels, all
to carry cargoes of refined petroleum, amount
ing In all to Â£417,000 cases, which with - thÂ»
carso of the Palgrave will amount to 18,470,000
gallons. It Is -no wonder our California rÂ»
flneriss are anxl^sly awaiting new and large
I discoveries of refinable petroleum. The Pactflo
Coast Oil Company needs five times the amount
It la now handling. The same with the Union
Oil Company. Â¦ Â¦ â¢-.. Â¦
INDICTMENTS BY THE
FEDERAL GRAND JURY
Smith, and Pitts Indicted for Note-
Passing IâMany1 â Many Other Cases Are
Ignored.
The United States Grand Jury reported
yesterday to United States District Judge
de Haven that they had found true bills
of indictment against Edward W. Smith,
George Abrams and Robert L. Pitts,
charging them with having in posses
sion and passing notes of the defunct
State Bank of New Brun3wick, New
Jersey. Charles J. Perry and William
Hagan had already been Indicted as mem
bers of the same gang.
The State Bank of New Brunswick has
been defunct for about thirty years and
the notes printed from genuine plates
were Imported from the East by Smith,
who owns an Interest in a curiosity ahop
on Montgomery streÂ«t. The gang pur
chased the notes from Smith and passed
them at par. mostly In denominations of
$1. upon poor tradespeople, receiving in
change from 75 to 90 cents in each case.
Smith at the time of his arrest was a
Federal official, being the confidential
clerk of Major Thomas J. Blakeney.
Superintendent of the L'nited States Life
Saving Service on this peninsula, apd
used the storeroom of the service as a.
hiding place for a quantity of the worth
less notes.
William Hagan appeared before Judge
de Haven yesterday morning, withdrew
his plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty.
He was ordered to appear on Monday for
sentence.
The Grand Judy ignored the following
charges:
Against G. P. de Ferrari, for selling
liquor without an internal revenue license.
Against I. Inda. Baptfste Laxaque,
Jannarina, Benito Gonl and John Doe, for
pasturing sheep on the Sierra forest
reserve. Against Edward A. Smith. Leo
pold Greenberg, Fred "W. Burke and
Harry Conners, for using the mails t*
further a scheme to defraud.
