GALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N. W.. WASHING
TON". March 4. â William McKinley began his second
term as President this" afternoo.n. reverently taking the
oath In the presence of an enormous crowd and solemnly
announcing his policy for the next four years In a speech re
markable for its boldness of declaration.
Theodore Roosevelt began to walk the thorny -and narrow
path that is to mark his public course at noon, when he was
Fwom to his duties as Vice President in the Senate chamber.
r>Â«!ng showered with many manifestations of esteem and ad
miration.
Call it what you willâ the pomp of coming empire, the
arreganc* of militarism, a spontaneous outburst of civic loy
alty â the Inauguration cf to-day, despite unpatriotic rain,
eclipsed as a spectacle anything ever attempted .at the induc
tion cf a President and Vice President into office.
It has been contrasted wifh the inauguration of Thomas
Jefferson In 1*01. when the President-elect walked to the Capitol
with a shouting crowd at his heels. The deduction Is that the
public seems to like best the twentieth-century way of doing
things. It has been contrasted with' the second inauguration
of James Monroe, when the "era of good feeling" was ushered
In. The lesson Is that McKinley is striving to bring the South
into the Republican fold, and this was disclosed dellberately
ln his address to-<iay.
The bold charge of the opposition, parties that the Govern
ment had entered upon an era of militarism was as boldly
met in to-day's Ir-augural parade. The bulk of the parade
was military. It was the largest display of regular troops
and National Guardsmen ever witnessed at an inauguration
In "Washington, yet there were only 3000 regulars in line. It
was likewise the smallest display of civic organizations.
But most remarkable of all was the candor and courage
â¢with which Mr. McKinley met the issues of the hour and
proclaimed the polio* of the Government
In his Inaugural address. He told how he
Intended to carry out the policy of Con
cress in Cuba without detriment to the
Cubans themselves. He declared that the
course new being pursued for the pacifica
tion and government of the Philippines
would be followed to the end. The United
States was not fighting the Filipinos. A
Email portion of the Filipinos were fight
ing the United States. There was to be
r-o step backward anywhere. The United
States had taken Its place among the
great powers cf the world and would
hold it.
"Surely." 6ald the President, "after 123
j-ears cf achievement for mankind we will
rot now surrender our equality with other
nation on matters fundamental and essen
tial to nationality. With no such purpose
wÂ»s the nation created. In no such spirit
has It developed Its full and Independent
â¢sovereignty. We adhere to the principle
of equality among ourselves, and by no
act of crars will we assign to ourselves a
subordinate rank # la the family of na
tions."
The weather was bad. After five weeks
of clearest ekles -Washington has ever
known rain began to fall not long before
the President took the oath. The crowds
were drenched. It rained throughout most
cf the afternoon. Senator James K. Jones,
chairman of the Democratic National
Comisittee, is satisfied the rain Is an evil
omen for the McKinley administration.
Senator Mark Hanna, chairman of the
Republican National Committee, Is con
vinced that the Ekles only wept to prevent
the aCmlnlstratton from being too happy
la Its present fortuitous situation. They
exchacged notes about It as they rode
Â¦with the President.
FOREIGN DIPLOMATS
STAND IN THE RAIN
The one great blot on the Inauguration
mi the treatment received by the foreign
Embassafiors and other diplomats accred
ited to the United States. Not only were
these dignitaries preceded en the stand
by Justices of the Supreme Court, in epite
of their protests, but they received abso
lutely no attention. They were all in their
magnificent and costly uniforms, and
were compelled to stand in the driving rain
tor nearly an hour. No effort was made
to provide them shelter; no effort was
made to get them umbrellas. The com
mittee in charge of arrangements, how
ever, Bought-chelter for themselves under
the roof of The President's stand/ leaving
the distinguished guests In the wet. The
Incident is bound to create an unpleasant
impression abroad.
President McKinley began his journey
to the Capitol with the plaudits of 100.000
persons ringing in his ears. He left the
White House about 10:30 o'clock. It was
an inspiring spectacle that met his gaze
as, pauring a moment on the portico, his
eyes swept up and down Pennsylvania
avenue. The court of honor, stretching
from the Treasury Department to the "War
Department, was packed with a dense
mass of humanity. The huge pillars, sur
mounted with their braziers for the red
fire of to-night's display, and graceful row
of white columns lining the drives to the
White House and extending along the
avenue on either side, gave a touch of
color to the spectacle. The enormous
Btand. Eeating 20,000 persons, was densely
packed with men and women.
The "old boys" of the civil war, who
were to be the President's special escort,
were drawn up in waiting. They had
gained their point, and were to have the
post of honor. They were as proud as
when they marched in Sherman's grand
review in 1S65. Bright-coated aids galloped
hither and thither. Bugle calls rang out
on the air. A battery rumbled by to
take up its position near the Capitol to
fire the President's talute. The cavalry
clattered through the streets to take Its
place for the parade. Bedraggled and be
lated National Guardsmen from New
York and Pennsylvania hurried about In
little squads, seeklna: their commands.
President McKinley was escorted by
Senator Hanna. Accompanying him and
Senator Hanna were Senator Jones, who
managed Bryan's campaign in 1896 and
1300. and Representative Cannon of the
House committee. Carriages, drawn up
in line, quickly received other members
of the party â inaugural committeemen,
members of the Cabinet and General Miles
and Admiral Dewev.
A touch of the whip by the "White House
coachman, who drove the President's car
riage, and the four horses that drew It
clattered down the avanue. As the Presi
dent's vehicle turned into Pennsylvania
avenue the escort fell In. General Greene,
grarid marshal, and his numerous staff
led the way. Then came General Daniel
E. Sickles, leading veterans of the civil
and Spanish-American war*. After them
came Troop A of Cleveland, In the most
brilliant uniforms that Ohio State pride
could devise.
MIGHTY CHEERS

Mighty cheers went up aa the Presi

The whole length of this broad thorough

The advance was slow and decorous. The
President constantly removed his hat.

White IJouse and the Capitol he musi
have bowed a thousand times. All tha
while, a bright smile illuminated his face
and the spirit of -perfect ease and con
tentment marked his *>very motion and
gesture. It was clear that this was Wil

he was realizing hia , most 'optimistic
dreams.

created aa much comment perhaps as the
best musical organization In the whole

One of the unique features of the mili
tary display was a battalion of the Porto

among- the n.atlve population; They were
not to be distinguished from other regu
lar Infantry regiments except by their
swarthy complexions and evidences in
their marching of an enthusiasm that won
the applause along the line of march.
Their welcome was of the warmest.
The civic division consisted of clubs
from all sections of the country, many of
them unique in their uniforms and rega
lias, and displaying decided proficiency in
maintaining their formation and keeping
up the high standard set by the military
division. There were two features in con

WASHINGTON. March 4.â Never has
an inaugural parade in. - "Washington
passed off with as little friction and with
i the general picturesque effect that accom
panied; the great pageant that served aa
President McKinley 's' and Vice President
Roosevelt's eacort . to: the "White House
after they had taken the oath of office
under -the shadow of 'the T- Capitol. The
police arrangements throughout were ex
ceptionally effective-^ The inaugural com
mittee had provided a barrier of Iron posts
and wire cable along both sides of Penn
; sylvanla avenue from the Peace monu
ment to Seventeenth street and succeeded
in absolutely keeping clear_ the line of
march for the first time in the history of
Inaugural displays In Washington. WThls
barrier was not-broken- through at- any
point during the whole day and the troops
were able to march in- extended -forma
tion, thereby adding to the beauty of the
display and the speed with which the pro
cttslon was -enabled to pass. The start
was. made from the Capitol about- 2:15
o'clock and the last of the civic organiza
tions had passed the reviewing stand at
the White House a little before 6 o'clock.
Considering the weather . conditions, the
parade In point -' of numbers closely ap- â¢
proxlmated the official forecast. â¢ The
promptitude with which it was- handled
by ; Grand Marshal Greene was decidedly
above the average for such an event. The
weather was not ' favorable I for - the pa
rade, a slow drizzle at Intervals, but for
tunately the weather was mild, so no pa
rader suffered any hardship from the ele
menta.
In point of beauty the military display
probably never has been exceeded in
Washington. The regular contingent of
cavalry, infantry and artillery were unl- :
formed as though for the most exacting
official Inspection, and their discipline was
beyond criticism. The same could be said
with equal emphasis of the naval con
tingent. Tho marines, a splendid body of
sea soldiers, and the blue-jackets, with
their rollicking, free and easy step,. were
especially well received by the crowds.
The naval contingent was larger than haa

While the treaty of peace with Spaln!*was
ratified, on the 6th of February, 1 1890, and rat
ifications were exchanged nearly two years
ago, the Congress has Indicated no form of
government for the Philippine Islands. It has,
however, provided an army to enable the exec
utive to suppress insurrection, restore' peace,
give security to the inhabitants and establish
the authority of the United States throughout
the archipelago. It has authorized the organi

regular force. It' has been advised from time

AÂ» heretofore so hereafter will the nation

ir.ake our way more difficult we must not be
disheartened, but the more earnestly dedicate
ourselves to the task which we have : rightly

so. They are inconvenient. They cost us

the effort and sacrifice, and are not those we
serve lifted up and blessed?
We will be consoled, too, . with the fact' that
pppoclt{on has confronted every onward effort
of the republic from its' opening hour until

marched on and on and â¢ its every step has
exalted freedom and humanity. We are under
going the same ordeal as . did our predeces
scrs nearly a century ago. We are following
the course they blazed. They triumphed. Will
their successors falter and , plead organic": lm

of achievement for mankind we will not now
surrender our equality with other powers on
matters fundamental and essential to national

created. Â¦ In no such- spirit has It developed its
full and . Independent sovereignty. We adhere

STRONG SPEECH
OF THE PRESIDENT
Through the lines of Senators and offi
cials, al! standing to do him honor, the
President proceeded to the' central pavil
ion, poing- forward to the railing and fac
ing the vast assemblage at close range,
again and again bowing his acknowledg'
rnents to the tremendous ovation from
40.000 throats. Then he turned and shook
hands with VicÂ«Â» President Roosevelt,
while another great cheer went up as the
two central figuresâ McKinley and Roose
veltâstood out above the crowd.
Ag-ain a. deep hush fell upon the assem
blage as the President and Chief ' Justice
advanced to the center of the pavilion.
The President removed his hat and then
raispd his hand. In the Intense stillness
faintly could be heard the solemn words
nt the Chief Justice and the measured
response of the President taking the oath
to maintain inviolate the constitution and
laws of the United States. He spoke in
Ftrong voice, easily heard by those near
the front of the stand. His face looked
very gTave as the oath was pronounced.
There was no Qemonstration as he con
cluded the oath. Now he turned again to
the people, and advancing to the rail' of
the pavilion began his inaugural address.
He epoke In rather low tones at first,
gradually growing more distinct untir he
was heard by all those on the stands and
most of those in the front rank of the
crowd. He kept his hat off while he spoke.
Occasionally he used gestures to empha
size some eaiient point of his address.
LEADERS STAND OUT
ABOVE THE CROWD
A blaze of color vas at every hand. Just
beneath the Goddess of Liberty a hir&e
f.&g hung out. The 14* dome was sur
rounded with flags, and further down
mammoth flaps hunp In graceful folds
from the pillared lront of the main
portico. The huge stand had a front
of solid colorâ fiae on flag. And amidst
this riot of color and of surging humanity
rose the central fÂ«aj'jre of the decorative
schemeâ the pavilion sheltering the Presi
dent and the distinjruiFhr-J assemblage
about him. It wa? of Grecian outline,
with Corinthian pillars and low archeA
roof. From the front of the pavilion
blazed the national arms. Just opposite,
on a raised platform, half a thousand
cameras wore trained on the Presidential
pavilion, looking l'kr so many machine
guns along a quarterdeck.
Just before 1 o'clock a drizzling sleet
â¢with r^ail begran to fall and over the sea
of heads went .up countless umbrellas.
The sky turned from gray to black' and
the FigTiS looked ominous. But the crowd
held 1tp ground unmindful of the lowering
tky and slanting hail.
It Â¦was lust 1 o'clock when the official
party came through the main doorway of
the Capitol. All eye* w^re strained to
ward the distinguished groups as they ap
peared. T'sually the President comes
among the first, but to-day there was en
tire change, and Instead of having the
President wait until all the officials were
in plare. the Presidential party did not
appear until all the Invited guests had
assembled and every inlng was In readi
ness to administer the oath. By this time
the hail had turned Into a steady drizzle
of rain.
When thÂ«Â» special guests had been ush
ered to their peats there was a momen
tary lull and silence fell upon the con
course as it strained to catch the lirst
glimpse of the President.
As President McKinley stepped out upon
the portico, in full view of the waiting
multitude, a great cheer went up which
was echoed and re-echoed until the huge
stand fairly tremMed with the volume of
foudJ. The President bowed his.aclcnowl
eri&iueuf of the greeting- His face wore
a look of calm dignity and contentment.
He put on his hat as he stepped into the
open and his overcoat was buttoned high
vp to kepp off the heating drops. He
moved across the portico and then, paus
ing at the top oÂ£ the high marble stairs,
again waved his Fa'.utations to the con
tinued hurrahs. With him was Chief Jus
tice Fuller, prepared to administer the
oath.

Eclf as ChL>i Magistrate, on 1
handsomely decorated stand
at the east front of the Capitol. In the
presence of a surging multitude. It was a
pudden transformation from the impres
*!ve solemnity of the .senate proceeding to
the brilliancy and clamor of an outdoor
spectacle of mammoth proportions. From
early in the day the whole city had emp
tied Us throngs Into thb vast- central
l>laza until by noon St was a billowing Â«x
jiatit-e of humanity, cut here and there by
narrow detiles for the uniformed maroh
tÂ»rs. Massed half wav back were the
mounted offerers of the military escort
and the staff. In their brilliant uniforms
of the cavalry, artillery and infantry. Off
to thÂ«? !Â»-ft. frontlnsr the Sonate. Troop A,
the President's crack company, sat mo
tionless on their black chargers. Fronting
the Houts* wlr.g was the s!lk-hatted and
b<-*ashe<1 citizens' committee, their horst:3
champing and restless amid the purh
ing thousands. Hack of the glittering
front of marshal, Generals, aids, with
thÂ«-!r waving plumes jind banners, surgoa
the countless multitude.. Quite as many
Â¦women were In the throngs as men. Far
over to the left stretched the military es
cort, horse, foot and artillery, nnd ofC to
(he right the State troops, awaiting the
*lKnal to movtj. Above ai! arose the co::
fut-ed sound of a. mighty multitude, Â¦wlin
the tramping of many feet, the galloping
of horses, the orders of chiefs and mar
t-hale, the c!ank of sabers and spurs, tin
found Â«jf an occasional bujj!e and the hum
of many voices. Jt ?s estimated that 40,000
people were packed In thlB assemblage.
Jutting out from the Capitol steps and
met-ping across the front were acr<ts of
treats, hundreds deeD and accommodating
BOM guests. OfT to the right, on the high
portico of the Senate wing, were more
peats, crowded with the distinguished
puet-ts of that body. To the left, on the

utilized fur a stand uivl the vast front

Vice President Auspiciously
Inducted Into Office,
WASHINGTON. March 4.-
Standing upon a spot hal
lowed by history and In
the presence of a brilliant
and distinguished assemblage]
Theodore Roosevelt of New York to-day
was inducted Into the office of Vice Presi
dent of the United States. The solentn
oath, the taking: of which places Mr.
Roosevelt In the van In a long Hat of .emi
nent patriots and statesmen, was admin
istered by Senator William P. Frye tt
Maine. -President pro texnpore of the
United States Senate. The ceremony was
thoroughly democratic, yet In Its simplic
ity profoundly impressive. Â«
The setting of the scene, would lend in
sph-atlon to the artisfs brush. The his
toric Senate chamber, superb In Its whlto
and gold beauty, was without decoration
of any kind. Not even the stars ami
stripes were displayed officially, although.
as the last words of the oath of office fell
from the lies of the stern-visaged. ailver
haired Senator from Maine, and Vice
President Roosevelt fervently clasped hi-*
hand, the galleries were splashed with the
national colors, many silken hand flag*
fluttering breezily among hundreds of
handkerchiefs.
Upon the floor of the chamber, intent
upon the ceremony, were men whoso
names are household words in every city.
Tho President of the United States was
there. Senators and Representatives,
members of the Supreme Court of th<.Â»
United States, Governors of many States,
members of the diplomatic corps, arm/
and navy officers and men distinguished
in all walks cf life were passive partici
pants in the ceremony. The galleries pro
sented a spectacle of marvelous beauty,
the hundreds of brilliantly attired women,
gay In handsome toilets, lending a color
scene to the almost too somber surround-
As the new Vice President dropped th3
hand of Senator Frye, he glanced upwar 1
at his wife, seated In the executive gal
lery. She was the first of whom ha
thought ir. this momentous hour and to
her he looked for inspiration. An Instant
later this vigorous American and man of
letters and of affairs faced the United
States Senate for the first time as its pre
siding officer. â¢
INDUCTION IS
MOST SUCCESSFUL
\ Not a flaw in the Induction of the Vies
President Into office was noticeable. Tho
whole was perfectly planned and beauti
fully executed. The Senate was in ses
sion, constructively, having been so slnre
11 o'clock Saturday morning, although
recesses taken at intervals had rendered
the mental and physical strain the more
endurable. Early in the morning the gal
leries had been cleared by an executive
session and they were not opened ag?jn
until 10 o'clock and then only to those wfro
held cards of admission to the Capitol and
to the places reserved for them In the gal
leries. Rapidly the galleries began to fill
and long before the hour for the ceremony
proper to begin, they were thronged to the
doors. Among the first persons of note to
enter the galleries were ladles and at
taches of the diplomatic corps not entitled
to the floor of the Senate. Lady Paunce
fote wife of the British Kmbassador. was
among the early arrivals, as also wa*
Mme. Wu. wife of the Chinese Minister.
Seated in the front row and attirad in a
gown of gorgeous Oriental silks made m
the fashion of her native land and wear
ing a blue silk band studded with dia
monds about her Jet' black hair, she wa3
the cynosure of hundreds of eyes. An
other attractive figure in the diplomatic
gallery was Mme. Takahlra. wife of the
Japanese Minister. Her gown was a revt?
lation of the drapers* art.
ARRIVAL OF THE
VICE PRESIDENT
At 10:30 o'clock the Vice President-elect
arrived at the Capitol, accompanied by
Senator Spooner and Representative Dal
zell. He went directly to the \ ice Presi
dent's room. Shortly before 11:30 ocloc/t
Mrs. McKlnley. escorted by Major Gen
eral Corbin. entered the executive gallery-
She was accompanied by the members of
her house party. She was assisted down
the aisle of the gallery to a front seat,
which had been reserved for her. She
chatted spiritedly with her friends, and at
times smiled recognition to some friend
on the floor of the Senate or In the gal
leries. â¢' .
Four years ago the venerable mother or
the President, then over 80 years old. was

cutive gallery, but to-day she was no
Almost simultaneously with the Presi
dential party Mrs. Roosevelt and her
friends, principally relatives, entered. Ac
cempanied by her children she was es
corted to front seats in the gallery, re
served for- them. Just opposite those oc
cupied by Mrs. McKinley.
The exchange of greetings between Mrs.
McKinley and Mrs. Roosevelt was noted
by all. The children of Mr. and Mrs.
Roosevelt, who. with eager eyes, drank
in every detail of the historic occasion,
gazed with wide-eyed wonder upon the
scene, not missing a single Incident or
detail.
Upon thÂ© floor of the Senate the pro
ceedings were in accordance with a defin
ite programme, from which there was no
deviation. The members of the Senate of
the United States, the host of the occa
sion, were seated to the front and to thÂ»
left of the President pro tem. Supporting
the Senate as host were representatives
of the executive and Judicial departments
of the Government, including members of
the Cabinet and House of Representatives
and the Justices of the Supreme Court.
On the oppositeâ the Democraticâ side
of the chamber guests were seated. As
the distinguished bodies entered the
chamber they were announced to the
President pro tem. of the Senate by Mr.'
Stewart and Mr. Layton. the doorkeepers
of the Senate. While the Senator from
Montana. Carter, was pronouncing the
last words of the rites over the river and
harbor bill, "the Speaker and the mem
bers of the House of Representatives"
were announced.' They were seated In the
rear of the rows of Senators' desks.
Speaker Henderson was escorted to a seat
to the right of and just below that of ths
President pro tem.
GREAT WAVES OF
APPLAUSE HEARD
At 11:45 the entrance of tho diplomatic
corps was anounced. Headed by the dean
of the corps. Lord Pauncefote, the Em
baasador of Great Britain, the Embajsa

and was listened to with tho utmost at

"Lot them go to the rear and let young

NATHANEL GREENE'S
TOMB AT LAST FOUND
LONDON. March 4.-The Duke of Bed
ford in the House of Lords to-day started
a. discus-sion of army matters by asking '
fir Information on the military adminis- |
traticn and the War Office.
Ix>rd Wolseley arose after the Duke of
Bedford had . done speaking and for two
or three hours he attacked the military
system of Great Britain, in a carefully
v.ritten speech, which it is understood he
had lone meditated and praised in con
sultation with his friends.
"My arguments." he said, '"are not di
rected against the individuals but against
the military system which I have honestly
tried for five years and have found want
ing, ar.d which entails many great dan
gers not realized by the people of this
realm."
.Lord Wolseley said he had worked with
the Marquis of I.ansdjwnÂ« and there had
not been a single disagreeable incident.
His complaint was that the professional
commander in chtef was robbed of his
<-hief usefulness. He had to hand over
the ccrr.mand and the entire management
of the array to a civilian .Secretary of
State, assisted by subordinates with whom
hf dealt direct. The responsibility for ev
erything rested with the Secretary of
Kiate alone. The commander in chief
could only bring strongly the wants of the
army to the Secretary. He had often done
so. After thtit he could do no more. He
added:
Wants of Army Unheeded.
"Although the various needs are undis
puted, not oniy are no *-teps taken to meet
Jhf-m. but no one outside of the Oovern
mmt is aware <hat th~ir urgency has been
raised. The Government has thought it
advisable for economic reasons to post
pore their provision, but yet it will not
take the nation into' .Is confidence. Thar
ftioh important demands for men aud
stores have been put iorward by experts
and nevertheless refused, I cannot assert
too emphatically. It behooves Parlia
ment to devise a plan by which strong
representations made and still refused
should be laid before the nation, for it to
decide between Â«he experts and the econ
omists. In no other way can we safe
guard the empire from great and un
known perils. Many an evening at the
fnd of a day's work I have felt sick at
heart when 1 contemplated the great na
tional risks deliberately accepted by the
?Jovernment which hauDened to be in of
fice. Why were they so accepted?. Be
<-ause it Â¦was not then ijolitically expedient
to ask Parliament for money."
Lord Wolseley outlined the present sys
tem, which he said was entirely unsuitetf
for the army.. under which It would never
be efficient, an-1 he doubted much If they
would ever have a contented army.
When he accepted the office of com
mander in chief he had been told It wae
proposed to Introduce regulations greatly
altering the position of future command
cry In chief. When he learned the nature
of thÂ«^se changes they were not to his
liking, but he had honestly given them
five y*Â»arÂ«' trial and was convinced they
would never make an *>JTective army. Up
to 1KS*5 he (the commander irt chief* was
responsible to the Secretary of State that
the army was thoroughly trained for war.
Since 1835 the responsibility had been
with the T'nder Secretary of State, with
subdivisions, each under a military head
and each advising the Secretary of 'State
without reference to the- commander in
chief. Lord Wolseley pointed out in de
tail how the distribution of responsibility
disorganized and impaired the war ma
chine. It was an unworkable and impos
sible system. The commander in cnlef
had no effective control. Neither bad the
beads of departments, and the work and
cross references in all branches had been
largely increased.
Jfo Love for War Office.
'.'My Lord*. I need scarcely tell you,"
Faid IxÂ»rd Wolseley, Impressively., "that
our soldiers do not love the War Office
nor its civilian rulers. Tou cannot flout
the sentiment of the army without injur
ing its morale."
- InfconcluRion Lord Wolseley said: "It
might reasonably be afked. if the army
system is so bad, how it was that such
a large army was dispatched to South
Afrira in so satisfactory a manner? The
answer i* simple. No army system,
however bad. would be nllowed to stand
tn the way at such a time by officials like
thosÂ»Â» composing the headquarters staff
In If33.
"I have known thÂ« TV'ar Office, for twen
tywight years, and I unhesitatingly say
It could not have been composed of bet
t*r men than those serving when PnÂ»i
dent Krugcr declared war. They were
eftVotlvf-Iy h>-lp*>d by the generai* ! and
ether officers at the port* of embarka-r
tlon. aJl of whom were determined that
the army should be dispatched, system or
r,n eyctem.
"But in so doing they were not helped
by the new nrray system. . If evÂ«r the his
tory of what was then done was fully
written the country will realize how
much it r.wes. to those officials, and how
little to the new fanglcd experimental
and unmilitarv system Â«Â«nfler which they
w^re sunpoÂ«Ad 1o work."
Wolseley Says Commaiider
in-Chief Is Robbed of
His Usefulness.

At 31:4^ o'clock last night, after the

a facetious vein he began his attack

VANCOUVER. B. C. March 4.-Thirty
five hundred 'Japanese who have become
naturalized British subjects by fraudulent
methods during the past year will have
their certificates canceled. Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. Premier of the Dominion, to-day
made this announcement to a delegation
of Vancouver laboring men who visited
Ottawa to discuss the question.
Japanese who had resided In the coun
try barely three months, instead of the
three years required by law, were rail
roaded through and papers granted on
false affidavits. According to law. only
British subjects are allowed to take out
fishing Â«nd mining licenses, so the graud
ulently naturalized Japanese came in for
all the privileges accorded" to British citi
zens, many of them within a month after
they had arrived in the country and when
they could not even speak a word of Eng
lish.
The Premier took the position that all
these naturalization papers Â¦would be can
celed, as it had been shown In the courts
that many at least had been obtained
fraudulently. Hereafter the' granting of
all papers shall be under the supervision
of Judg-es of the Supreme Court Instead
of Justices of the Peace, as at present.
The Premier objected to the extension of
the time for qualification for citizenship

of Krueerism."

BAKERSFIELD, March 4.â Mrs. Frank
Silva, whose home Is four miles south of
this city, is in the County Jail for killing
her : son-in-law. Manuel OHverla. The
murder, took place in the kitchen of the
Sllva home, at 10 o'clock this morning.
Soon afterward Mrs: Silva. accompanied
by her husband, appeared at the jail and
surrendered herself.
Ollveria and Maggie Silva, the 17-year
old daughter of Mrs. fcilva. were married
yesterday. To-day Ollveria went with his
bride to Visit her naronts. "When he en
tered the house there was a brief but
bitter ' quarrel, which ended with the
mother-in-law opening flre upon him. The
bullet entered his head and death was in
stantaneous. "Â¦ Â¦â¢ Â¦
Frank Silva was in a field some dis
tance from the house when the murder
took place. Mrs. Silva went out to inform
him of what she had done, leaving her
daughter alone in the house with the mur
dered husband. Silva. and his wife ct
once came to town and surrendered.
The cause of the â¢ tragedy is unknown.
Neither of the Silvas nor Ollveria's wife
will say a word. When pressed for an ex
planation of the awful affair, the mother
in-law nonchalantly answered: "Wait till
the inquest to-morrow and you will learn
all."
The neighbors had believed that every
thing went well with the Sllvas and their
son-in-law. ' Sllva had given his consent
to the marriage.
The dead man -was 40 years of age and
came here from Reedley. The Sllvas are
old citizens of this countv. The inquest
will be held to-morrow. Ths young widow

THE WRECK OF THE RIO.
r^v ROB ABLY no other disaster at sea has pre
| J tented so many unpleasant and blameworthy
* features as the wreck of the Rio. It is
dence that orders were violated right and left *The
captain was under orders not to make or leave port
in a foÂ£. The chief engineer was under orders to be
iX his post of duty, but he was in his room. The
life-saving lookout was tinder orders to report distress
fcignals or other sign of wreck and trouble. He heard
tbe < regulation death song of the Rio's whistle and
;j=id no attention to it. As far as the investigation has
gone the ill-starred passengers had the benefit of none
of the safeguards upon which all who go down to the
sea in ships rely for their safety in making or leaving
a port controlled by a civilized Government. The
pride and the interests of San Francisco arc deeply
tcuched by the series of untoward incidents. We by
no means pretend that any human foresight, courage
und fidelity can eliminate all elements of danger on
the water. We desire to be lenient and respectful of
the misfortunes of those who are involved in the re
sponsibility for this htart-breaking disaster. But at
the sane time one cannot avoid feeling that the long
shipwreck record of the Pacific Mail Company should
have admonished it to extra caution. The loss of nine
teen great ships in fifty 3'ears should have accumu
lated an experience that would have raised safeguards.
Perhaps it has. We don't know. " The action of Cap
tain Ward in permitting his ship to start in the fog
rri2y have its explanation in some bad half hours that
captains have who do not make time. Is it dread of
that makes them take risks?
Steamers are sometimes overloaded, or their cargo
is badlj' stowed. The captain has to take jhe- risk.
Has he authority over the agent to refuse more cargo
when his capacity is reached? The wreck of the Rio
raises all these and other issues, in which the public
have a keen interest.
Is our harbor properly buoyed and equipped with
fog whistles and lights? Would a bell or whistle* on
Mile Rock have prevented this disaster? Does the
Government do its full duty by San Francisco har
bor? Have we the automatic lights, duplicate light
ship and other safeguards which it is considered the
duty of all Governments to provide for the safety of
mariners?
All these axe vital questions. Two large steamers
of, the Pacific Mail Company have laid their bones
in the Golden Gate within gunshot of each other. If
that had happened to the Cunard line in New York
harbor its significance would have been understood.
It would have been taken as implying lack of skill or
discipline on board, or failure of the -Government to
properly chart, light and buoy the harbor, or both.
Our. commercial bodies, which comprehend the
Kfeat importance of these safeguards to the good rep
utation of the port, and have knowledge of the im
portance of that reputation to every interest here,
should make themselves felt in securing whatever may
be done to remove the bad impression made by this
latest and saddest sacrifice of life and property.
It is too hte to save the ship that lies at the bot
tom, but it is not too late to take measures to keep
others from joining her.- , â¢
Among the things bard to understand is the con
tinued defense of the delinquent life-saving lookout,
r.fter his confession tint the sinking steamer's distress
signal was heard and not. heeded, by the superinten
dent of that service. . , .
He meets this confession by a plea for suspension
of judgment until the matter is investigated! The con
fession admits all that an investigation could find out.
Ir is this sort of thing that demoralizes a service and
makes it unfit for its functions.

It is a mistake, to treat rice as a tropical cereal only.
It is the leading. field crop of Japan and of parts of
China that are by no means tropical. There is no
reason why-it should not flourish in California . and
even become eventually an article of export to Asia;
Li Hung Chang; is authority for the statement that
the population of China is about to overtake the food
supply, and that rice or a substitute must soon be
largely imported to take its place. With this prospecT
in view it is quite worth while to experiment with
rice on the overflow lands of this State. Much of the
land in the Yolo basin, which is periodically flooded,
resembles the rice land of Eastern Texas. The river
islands, in the delta, that are under levee, oughf.to
find rice a profitable crop at a, yield of two tons per
acre, which. ought to, be reached. . .We are large im
porters of rice to supply the demand of our Asiatic
population, who prefer it to any other cereal. ' Â¦ V-''
But the marvel is that California capital should go
away from home to raise rice. The, tule lands of the
delta of the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers arid
their borders present an ideal situation for r^ce cul
ture. These lands when leveed have every facility for
flooding and draining, and their fertility and-dura
bility excel the quality of the Texas lands. â¢
OUR readers were surprised to learn that Cali
fornia capital is invested in raising rice it
Eastern Texas. That rice field was opened by
a number of settlers from Iowa, who interested Gov
ernor Shaw and a group of Iowa, capitalists. The ter
ritory, adjoins the rice rlands of Western Louisiana,
and is well situated for the flooding that is necessary
to the crop and the draining that is required at har
vest time, when the grain is cut with a reaping ma
Â¦chine and threshed iike wheat, after which the
'/paddy," as the unhulled rice is 'called, is taken to the
mill, which hulls and fits it for consumption. Texas,
from the Brazos eastward, is fitted for both rice and

Although the work of reform had begun
upon the deposition- of Ismail It naturally

people at once. Commencing in the army.

,When Ismail Pasha came tp the thror.e
in 18C3 the national debt was only about
Â£3,000,000, and yet in 1S76 It had mounted
to Â£89,000,000, and this without any cau*c
except the awful extravagance of the
Pasha. To meet the interest on this debt
and to pay the increased taxes the inhabi
tants of. the country were squeezed and
ruined without mercy. Thus it was a re
lief 3 when the . deposition of Ismail took
place in 1879, and the dual control of
France and England was established. The
finances of the country were in' a fright
ful condition and it was not possible for
Egypt to repudiate its debts. Europe was
bound to intervene and after Ions negotia
tions an arrangement was arrived at
whereby the interest on the debt was re
duced, "but Â¦' Egypt was not allowed to
spend any money without the consent of
Europe. The "Caisse de la Dette." a
board of representatives of the preat pow
ers, acts as receiver and controller of- the
finances. The consent of this board has
to be obtained before any money may bt
spent or any loan raised for extraordinary
needs. This fact necessarily hampers the

Disastrous Rule of Ismail Pasha-
In the time of Napoleon the struggle be
tween France and England for a colonial
empire was principally, fought out in
Egypt, and since the construction of the
Suez canal tho country has become still
more important, politically as as
commercially. Egypt is the Nile and the
Nile is Egypt. Without the one great
river there would only be a desert where
ence flourished the civilization of the
Pharaohs. Thus we see plainly that it
really Is not of such great importance
who occupies Egypt as It is who occuptes
the Soudan and the country of the upper
Nile. Since the last war in the Soudan,
which resulted in tho crushing of the der
vish power, that country has been placed
under the joint control of England and of
Egypt, quite irrespective of Â¦ the situation
in the country of the lower Nile. By this
stroke of policy in gaining control of the
Nile the position of England in Egypt Jrf
practically rendered unassailable, anÂ«
England may now remain there as Ions
as it shall desire to do so. -
Egypt is a tributary state of Turkey
and pays annually a tribute of about
Â£750,000 ($3,630,000). The Khedive, however,
fs practically independent,' as far as his
own territories are concerned. In the
time of the Khedive Ismail, .after 1863, flu
Suez canal was constructed at a cost of
pome Â£16,000,000 and thousands j of lives
Great Britain bought Egypt's ; rights in
the canal, and thus the country through
which this important waterway runs has
no share in its success. The share pur
chased by Great Britain for Â£4,000,000 is
now worth at least Â£20.000,000.

creditable to England. This is still true,
even if we impute to her the most unfa
vorable motives for all the good work
done. "Grajited. for the sake of argument,
that the British Intend to remain per
manently in Egypt, does that at all lessen
the value of the fact that now the an
nual taxes per head of the inhabitants
amount to only 17 shillings 6 pence ($4 20),
as compared with Â£1 2 shillings 6 pence
($5 44> in 18S1; or that the proportion of
debt per head is only Â£10 2d ($43 44), as
compared with Â£14 8s 9d ($69 83) in the
former year? Whatever may be the pol
icy of Great Britain with regard to Egypt.
It will be an unhappy day that sees tho
Egyptians restored to that complete freer
dom under which extortion and the cor
vee so luxuriously flourished in the olden
times.
In the Soudan It is too early to be ablo
to form any idea as to how the new rule
will work out. It is probable, however,
that as soon ns the military rule gives

insuring constant crops will still further

given below show how much is due to Im
proved irrigation. In 1S82 the cotton crop

years was 26.6S7.000 kilos and 73,597,000 kilos
respectively.
The courts of justice were reorganized
and mixed tribunals -were introduced to
deal with cases In which the parties were
of different nationalities. The composi
tion of these tribunals was partly native
partly European. In the native courts
crimes have greatly diminished. In 1S36
there were 1S66 cases; in 1S97 there were
1424 cases.
Growth in Prosperity.
Great Britain abolished the corvee
which had formerly been in force for the
clearing of the canals by forced labor of
tho "peasants. The loss such forced labor
meant to the peasants was considerable.
Now only at high Nile are they liable to
be called upon to prevent floods. In 18S1
251,283 men were called out for the corvee;
In 1S97 11,069 only were called out.
tion of affairs becomes more and more
satisfactory to the people and the advan
tages df law and order are so apparent
that there is no longer any grumbling
against reform.

It is to be trusted the confiding natives who take
the oath of allegiance to our flag with such joyous
ceremonies and such high hopes are not going to be
disappointed. Whatever we do in the islands should
be done honestly for the moral and material -good of
the people. It will be our own fault if the starry ban
ner which Ascension so earnestly hailed should evir
beanything else to the loyal Filipinos than a symbol
of peace and prosperity.
There is something attractive, and charming in the
Filipino idea of making a festival out of the ceremony
of oath-taking. It is far better than the way the thing
is done in this country, where the naturalization of a
citizen is carried Jout in a manner so perfunctory it
can hardly appear solemn, even to the most devoted
patriot. Moreover, Ascension's speech* while flowery,
as befits his tropic race, has a good deal of well tem
pered sense in it, and shows what Filipino loyalists
hope for from this country.
It appears that when the Filipino employes of the
Ordnance Department were to take the oath of alle
giance to the United States and the flag they deter
mined to make a fiesta of the occasion and to perform
the ceremony with something of dignity and* grace.
At the close of the formal oath-taking one Hugo
Ascension, chosen orator of the day, made the follow
ing speech: "Filipinos: This~is the hour in which
'the light spreads itself over the fields like a mantle of
gold; when the ancient trees, with their clinging
parasites, lazily move their great crowns in the breath
of the. early breeze; when the shrubs greet the day
with the delicious odors of their flowers, on whose ten
drils the dew has left a pearl which the sun turns
into a beautiful gift from a serene night of love; when
the birds raise, in concerted choir, their hymn of
praise â in shortfall nature salutes the father of life,
the luminous representation of the Creator of the
world. Now that we have had the happiness of being^
gathered under the starry banner, do not doubt, Fili
pinos,- that the grand republic of America is that
which will conduct us, be it late or early, to the moral
and material good of these islands." Therefore, you
who have signed and sworn your fealty to this grand
nation, join with me in crying: Long live the starry
banner! Long live our colonel! Long live our lieu
tenant! Long live AMERICA!"
WE get so much in the way of ill news. from the
Philippines it is worth while to give special at
. . tention to, anything in the way of comfort and
joy that comes from that quarter. For that reason we
note with satisfaction in a copy of the Manila Times,
just received, a speech by a Filipino which is at once
glowing, patriotic and' graceful.

XETV YORK. March 4.-The following
ca:ltfobniaj*s in mew yobk.
Since the wrong has been carried to the extent de
scribed it is certainly time something be done to pre
vent it. When in a single city there are reported
more than 2000 cases of want caused by husbands de
serting their wives and helpless children, it is high
time the law undertake to suppress the practice.
While we have no such troubles as these in our fair
land of happy homes we can none the le'ss sympathize
with the Eastern legislators who have to deal with
them. Undoubtedly wife desertion is bad. Some of
our Eastern: exchanges declare it to be worse than
wife-beating. To leave a family exposed to want ami
in danger of starvation, they say, is a greater wronij
than to whip the whole family from mother to babe.
On an issue of that kind we cannot pronounce judg
ment. The relative demerits of the two evils are bet-:
ter understood in the East than here*, and we cannot
do better than to accept the decision of the experts
of that section. The desertion of families may there
fore be conceded the crying evil of the time on the
other side of the Rockies. It makes not only the wife
cry, but the charitable societies cry, whereas in wife
beating there is only one who has to weep.
It would seem that since divorces are so cheap and
easy in the East husbands and wives who could
not get along together without fighting could readily
quit and start anew. Evidently, however, the seeming
ease of divorces is deceptive. There are troubles that
cannot be reached by legal separation. The husband
either desires to thrash his wife or to fly from her
without paying the costs of a divorce suit and run
ning the risk of being saddled by the burdens of ali
mony. -
That makes the third- Eastern State that has had
its attention drawn this winter to matrimonial infelici
ties that cannot be cured by divorce. In Connecticut
they, have been discussing the advisability of estab
lishing a whipping-post for the punishment and re
form, of husbands who beat their wives. In Delaware
they have been trying to devise a means of dealing
out square justice to women who beat their husbands,
and now Illinois seeks to restrain deserters.
LEGISLATORS in Illinois" are trying to devise a
means to compel Chicago husbands to support
their .wives. It appears the three charitable
societies of that city have reported more than 2000
cases of want caused by the desertion of their families
by husbands, and have asked that something be done
to check the evil. The response of the Legislatu-e
has been made by the introduction of. a bill providing
that a husband convicted of deserting his wife shall be
confined for a term in penitentiary and while there
shall be required to work at some, profitable trade,
the earnings whereof shall be turned ovej" by the State
to the family left in want.

in 1SS2 to establish a good government for
Egypt. Much has been done since then,
but the material upon which the English
officials have to work is so little progress
ive that much time must be spent before
the Egyptians really appreciate the mean
ing of freedom.
About 60 per cent of the population be
longs to the agricultural class â the "rel
lahin.'* These people are conservative and
primitive in their habits and are uniformly
cheerful despite the centuries of oppres
sion which they have undergone. Food is
cheap, and there is no appearance of ab
ject poverty to be found. A peasant can
live well on a piastre (5 cents) a day.
The greater part of the population are
Mohammedans, but they are not particu
larly, fanatical. In upper Egypt are to be
found the Copts, or native Chri3tians. who
form about one-tenth of the population.
They are credited with being less honest
than their Mohammedan 'fellow country
men and are looked down upon by the lat-
British Rsform in Egypt.
Turning to what has been done In the
way of reform since 1SS2 by Great Britain
in Egypt we find, naturally enough, that
tho changes instituted were not at all
popular at first. The native officials
found out that they were no longer free
to extort money, the wealthy landowners
discovered that no longer was all the wa
ter their.* for irrigation; and even the
"fellahin" were disappointed because
their creditors flocked back and demanded
payment of loans contracted In Ismail's
time. However, year by year the condl-
The position of the British in Egypt Is
without parallel In the whole world. There
Is no protectorate over Egypt, there has
been no annexation and yet, to all In
tents and purposes, England rules the
ccuntry.. .
Egypt doÂ«s not bring any revenue to
Englandâ In fact. It costs large sums an
nually to maintain the occupation. There
1b always the chance that the develop
ment of Egypt may enlarge the market
for British goods, but as the policy of
the open door iÂ» adhered to with the
greatest firmness, this method of making
the occupation worth while does not seem
particularly and selfishly good. Of course,
as the principal" shareholder In the Suez
canal Great Britain feels bound to insure
peace and good government In the coun
try through which the canal passes.
The. position In Egypt is somewhat sim
ilar to what would have been the case
in the Philippines if America had allowed
the Filipinos to govern the country under
Spanish suzerainty, with an international
hoard to manage the. revenue and expen
diture "of the Islands. Such a state of
affairs would naturally suggest chaos and
impracticability of any sane government;
yet this is almost exactly the position
England occupies In Egypt, with, in addi
tion, several other obnoxious restrictions
to contend with. That under the circum
stances it has been possible to lift the
Egyptian people as much- as It has done,
and to introduce good government, is most

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS,
Such are the President's declarations concerning the
chief issues before the republic. There is everything
in them to confirm public confidence in the adminis
tration and not a word to give rise to any fear of dis
turbance in domestic or in foreign affairs. The people
can draw from it a renewed assurance that the admin
istration of the government is in safe hands, and that
whatever emergency arise we shall have in the White
House the right statesman to dea! with it.
In the Philippines the President points out that he
is seeking to establish peace and civil government.
By far the greater part of the inhabitants, he says,
"recognize American sovereignty and welcome it as
a guarantee of order and of security for life, property,
liberty, freedom of conscience and the pursuit of hap
piness." He declares emphatically he will protect
the loyal Filipinos against tfie aggressions of insur
gents, and he adds: "Force will not be needed or
used when those who make war against as shall make
it no more."
Upon the questions involved in our relations to
Cuba and the Philippines the President's declarations
are clear and emphatic He expresses gratification at
the recent act of Congress defining the policy which
the legislative branch of the Government deems essen
thl to the best interests of Cuba and the United
States, and announces an intention to uphold that pol
icy to the end, so that there shall be secured to the
Cuban people a "free commonwealth on abiding foun
dations of right, justice, liberty and assured order."
It is significant of McKinley's progressive states
manship.that he does not dwell long upon the record
of things accomplished, but proceeds at once to direct
attention to things which remain to be done. Upon
that point he said: "The national verdict of 1896 has
for the most part been executed. Whatever remains
unfulfilled is a continuing obligation, resting with un
diminished force upon the Executive and Congress."
That declaration gives the country hope that the
pledges to promote the construction of the Nicaragua
canal, to upbuild the American merchant marine and
to provide an adequate immigration restriction law
will be speedily fulfilled. It gives assurance that the
administration will urge those great measures upon
Congress at the next session, to the end that every
promise made by the Republican party to the people
will be faithfully kept
The country, looking back to the years of, the first
hard fight against Bryanism and free silver, has ample
reason to rejoice that the common-sense of a majority
of the voters was sufficient to save the republic from
the menace of that financial fallacy and demagogism.
What would have been the condition of the country
and the people had Bryan been elected it is impossible
to say, but it would surely have been far different
from that which prevails. Instead of being able to
contrast our good fortunes of the present with the
anxiety of the past four years of Bryanism would
have brought us to a point where we would look back
upon the conditions of four years ago as a period of
comparative prosperity and security.
It is indeed gratifying to note the difference between
the conditions of the country now and what they were
when McKinley made his inaugural address four years
sgo. At that time, as he has said, "There was great
anxiety with regard to our. currency and credit. None
exists now. Then our treasury receipts were inade
quate to meet the current obligations of the Govern
ment Now they are sufficient for all public needs,
and we have a surplus instead of a deficit. Then I felt
constrained to convene Congress in extra session to
devise revenues to pay the ordinary expenses of the
Government. Now I have the satisfaction to an
nounce that the Congress just closed has reduced
taxation in the sum of $41,000,000. Then there was
deep solicitude because of the long depression of our
manufacturing, mining, agricultural and mercantile
industries, and the consequent distress of our laboring
population. Now every avenue of production is
crowded with activity, labor is well employed, and
American productions find good markets at home*
and abroad."
T-\ RESIDENT McKINLEY.'S inaugural address
L_y is marked by a directness of expression .ra^e
i~^ among statesmen. He announces with satis
faction that much has been done during the past four
years to provide legislation needed for the welfare of
the country, but does not hesitate to point out that
much remains to be done. The greater portion of the
address is devoted to the issues growing out of the
war with Spain, and on each of those issues he speaks
with clearness and with force.

Dairy School for Kings County.
Myers succeeded in getting his bill ap
propriating $20,000 for a dairy school in
Kings County, to be conducted under the
direction of the University of California,
passed this afternoon. The bilK went
through by a vote of 53 to 18.
When the bill was taken up. Brown of
San Mateo moved that a committee of one
be appointed to amend by directing that
the school be established in Alameda or
San Mateo County, instead of Kings. The
fight was made along that line, the As
semblymen 1 who more directly represent'
the wishes of the regents and the faculty
of the University of' California support
ing the' amendment, since, the university
authorities have desired that if the schodl
be established it be located on property
already, owned by the university in Ala
meda or San Mateo county.
. Myers spoke at length In support of his
bill, contending for the establishment of
a school where practical dairy work
should be taught, rather than making the
training of experts its ideal. Ralston.
Brown of San Mateo and Anderson of So
lano spoke in behalf of the wishes of the
university authorities, but the majority
was against them.' and Brown's amend
ment was Â¦ lost. After the roll call by
which the bill was passed, Anderson
changed his vote from aye to no and gavcr
notice of a motion to reconsider.. , .

decision : over ' Tommy West of . Brooklyn
after seventeen rounds of a twenty-*ouud
contest. "West's seconds'- threw* up the
sponge. - '
The fight took place at .the Auditorium,
under the : auspices of the Southern ; Ath-i
letic Club, and was the bloodiest arid moat
desperate ever seen in : Louisville. They
entered the - ring at catch Â« weights and
each weighed in the neighborhood of 157
pounds.*- , - * ' 'Â¦'-' .
After the- tenth round West was assist
ei by Terry McGovern. In the first round
honors " were abouy even, though both

"With but three days more in which' lo
draw their per diem the lawmakers to
day got down to business and. gave a good
illustration of what can be accomplished
in the matter of twentieth century legis
lation. . .
In the Senate an obstruction to the dis
patch of business was encountered in the
Â¦form of Cald well's bill to appropriate $15,
000 for a girls' reformatory at Sari'Jacinto,
Riverside County. The "bill originally
called for an appropriation of $50,000, but
was amended in committee to $15,000.
â¢'Currier said the establishing of an in
stitution as proposed by the bill was a
necessity and would aermlt of the separa
tion of the sexes now at Whittler.
Simpson said the bill originated .in the
peculiar views of Mrs. Mitchell, a mem
ber of the board of trustees of the Whit
tler School, who is opposed to corporal
punishment for girls. Dr. Llndley wanted
to get .her off the board and this would
account for any favor he might give this
bill for a separate Institution.
Caldwell highly praised Mrs. Mitchell
for her efforts in behalf of the girls at
Whittier, and said she favored the pro
posed separation of the girls from the
boys in two different institutions. He
argued that there was need for the
change. $
The bill finally passed by a vote of 29
to 5,

Wolfe designated this as the most bra
zen piece of effrontery ever presented to
the Legislature. Ho considered it a pe
culiar circumstance, to say the least, that
a bill previously introduced and bearing
upon the same subject could not be found
upon the Senate files nor in the sergeant
at-arms' room/ where bills are to be had.
Laird offered an amendment which was
intended to throw the cost of examination
to determine values for a "fixed policy'-'
upon the insurance company writing the
risk, but this was voted down and the
bill finally passed.
The general appropriation bill made its

featureV of the bill. Many of them were
merely changes in verbiage. Anderson of

Melick meking the ' law mandatory in all

Vallejo would have been the only cltlea

PLEADS FOR THE BIG TREES.
Father Kenna Makes an Appeal to
Senate Members.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 4.â To-night, after ad
journment, the Senators lingered in the
Senate chamber long enough to hear the
Rev. Father Kenna address them on be
half of .the bill to appropriate $250,000 to
purchase the Big Baein grove of big trees.
Father Kenna described the grove as
being a natural reservoir of water. The
trees were going fast, he said, and when
they were gone the springs, which were
fed from the water they held in storage,
would run dry and tha country would
wither for want of water. No one seemed
to realize, he said, the amount of water,
the trees held, and should they be de
stroyed thÂ» country would in a year lose
more by drought than would pay for the
grove twice over. He described the rav
ages of the lumbermen, and commented
on the fact that of this native tree, found
only in. this State, California did not own
a single specimen. On behalf of the
Sempervirens Club, and on behalf of the
grove of giants, he asked the Senators to
vote for the bill. . â¢

In the seventh Ryan's lip was split an-1
West's nose was br6ken, his right eye
closed, .his ' forehead laid open in two
â¢places and his cheek split. Blood poured
from his wounds as time after time Ryan
landed on the injured places. | He played
continuously for the broken nose and for
the next half-dozen rounds made a verit
able chopping, block of West. The pun
ishment West took was wonderful, blood
pouring from . nearly a dozen of his
wounds. West's ; corner looked, like a
slaughter house, and the fighters' attaches
actually had to I wipe the blood from . the
floor with a mop. So bloody indeed -was
the fight â¢ that several persons near the
ring were nauseated and had to leave th?
hall.' Still during round nftert round West
came up only for pounding on the nose,
eye and cheek. In the seventeenth rouml
when It. was seen that "West was fighting
a hopeless fight, Terry McGovern threw
up. the sponge for West and the referee
gave the decision to Ryan.

Fourteen books cut in and did what they
were pleased to call "a fair business.' It
was a hard day for the 'picking.
In the first race over seven furlongs
Fondo was made favorite over Cougar by
a small margin and the running .showed
that it should have been the reverse.
Cougar with Henry up kept well to the
front and at the far * turn took
the lead, winning easily O'Connor
on Fondo battling with Peterson on
Kingstelle, a 50 to 1 shot, for the place.
The second race over six furlongs was
won by Saintly. Burns up. A strong tip
floated round the ring that Amelia Fonso
was just about the proper thing and' the
price was quickly backed down from 5 to
1 to 2\<z to L It was Saintly all the way,
Pa'rmenion and Redwald getting the place

the outset, but Lady Bird finished in pun
l.=hlr.s style and took the first money.
Tommy burns mounted on Cayenne Pep

The fourth race went to the favorite
Kenilworth. Tommy Burns piloting the
winner. Sad Sam, Maggie .Davis and
Dangerous Maid, all slated for good odds
on the books, were accounted several
good things, but this race was run on
form. Gonfalon coming up from behind
and getting the place. Sad Sam burled
his face in his handkerchief and came
home in time for the show.
The talent shouted Wyoming in the<lapt
race over the mile route. Sotne said
"nay,, nay, the Handicapper," and still
others The Phoenician. For three
fourths of the distance it might have
been either the Handicapper or Wyoming,
but after that it was The Phoenician,
ridden to victory by Winnie O'Connor.
The Phoenician was good at 3 to 1.
The last race, one mile and seventy
yards, was hard picking and the third
choice out- of n. square field won. The
Singer, O'Connor up, and Artllla, Tommy
Burns at the wheel, received extensive
backirg. Rapido, 75 to 1, ran like a tor
rentâat firstâ then closed up like a snail.
Artilla and The Singer had a tussle from

Dan Hamon certainly cannot be accused
of being cheap. When he began racing
Sly at Oakland some weeks ago he en
gaged Bullman to ride the mare in all of
her races. Under the agreement then
made the Jockey receives half of every

THE favorites did not win at Tan
foran yesterday. Second choices
made themselves first in several
instances, a long-shot jogged in
By F. E. MULHOLLAND
TUB connoisseurs of the racing
game did not take kindly to the
ride of Master Owen Mounce on
Yellowtall in . the last event at
Oakland yesterday, nor did it suit
the judges, apparently. Of late the Idaho
boy has cultivated a fad of waiting al
together too long -with the horses he
rides, which the clever jockey should
eliminate from his work. The distance
was six furlongB, and Sly, with Bullman
up, reigned a 4 to 5 choice* For a spell
it was a two-horse affair, the favorite and
Frank Bell racing off In front, with Yel
lowtail under wraps six or eight lengths,
back. Bell tired in the stretch, while Yel
lowtail came with a great burst of speed,
finishing with his head lapped, over Sly's
Hanks at the wire. The time, 1:14, was
very fast, as the track is far from being
in lightning-fast condition. Mounce was
called Into the stand and questioned ' by
the officials, who announced that tliey
would lock further into :the matter to
day. It appears Mounce rode according
to "instructions, and as there was nothing
suspicious-looking about the betting the
toy. beyond cavil, merely made his movo
late, as he very often does. Yellowtall
is again in fine fettle, and will take some
beating fiom now on.
Superb weather continues drawing very
fair crowds to the track- across the bay,
and the eport Is above the average. Fa
vorites in the betting still maintain their
winning form,- four purses falling to
short-priced ones yesterday. Each day
Jcr<n Builman earns fresh laurels by his
splendid saddle work, his record again be- 1
Ing three winninc mounts.
Looked upon as a "moral" and exten-
Eively played at 1 to 2, Homage, from the
Burns & Waterhouse stable, was ridden
out to the last ounce to beat Irate in the
opening sprint. Two rank outsiders, Cath
erine Bravo and Carrie Lucas, headed the
favorite into the stretch. Then, under
Bullman's strong urging, she worked her
way to the front, scoring by a head.
Tom Calvert fooled all of the wise oneÂ»
by taking the mile and fifty-yard run, de
cided under selling conditions, at odds of
15 to 1. Mounce had the mount on the
old gelding, an-1 clearly outfooting Alaria
in the run home, won by five open lengths.
Snips ridden by Howson enjoyed first call
in the betting, but made a weak showing.
Sam Howard with Bullman up and a
widely circulated tip, finished third, out
run from the start.
Bookmaker Johnny Humphrey's chest
nut colt Maraschino ran circles around
the other baby racers in the two-year-old
dash. Held an 8 to 5 "favorite through
out, he won all the way, leading out the
20 to 1 .shot Waterscratch more than a
length! Ranscn finished a distant third
with Torso Maid. â¢ '->â¢
Quite in keeping with his past reputa
tion, Gibraltar, the big black rogue, let
the talent down hard over his defeat in
the seven furlong purse run. An even
money chance, he bluffed along behind
Alleviate, which mare led to the paddock.
About this time Mounce came along on
Torsina and giving Gibraltar a slight
bump in passing, the black fellow
put back his ears and sulked. At
the wire, Torsina got the verdict from
Alleviate by half a length. The winner
was 4 to 1 In the betting.
Scotch Plaid ruled favorite for the mile
selling affair and was kept very busy in
returning with the coin. At the start, E.
Matthews, piloting the lightweight Dandy
Jim. went out with a catapult-like shoot
and nearly stole the race. Leading at one
Etage by nearly ten lengths, he backed
up the last sixteenth, losing out by a
neck. Herculean ran third.

Resolutions Denouncing Policy .of
the Late Queen- Victoria Adopted
â¢ at Metropolitan Hall.
The one hundred and twenty-third an
niversary of the birth of Robert. Emmet
was celebrated at Metropolitan Hall last
night by a musical and literary enter
tainment. An oration was delivered by
the Rev. Father William Gleeson of St.
Anthony's Church, East Oakland. -
"We meet to-night," said Father Glee
son, "to commemorate the memory "of
that great Irish patriot, Robert Emmet,
who forfeited his life in behalf of Irish
Independence. His memory is as"- revered
to-day as it was in the past. Did he not
give to. the cause all that any man co.uld
give? He gave his time, his talent and
his life. What more could any man give?
He 'was 'a patriot. It is the same spirit
of patriotism that is nerving the arms of
the BoerÂ» and compelling England to
pcour her colonies- to get men to put down
20,000 liberty loving people. It is sad to
say however, that our kith and kin are
under the flag of England fighting against
these Boer patriots. England has ruled
most unjustly. She has sent thousands
of her fellow countrymen into slavery and
bondage.
"I believe that England has lost all
right to govern in Ireland. I hope to see
the day when every Irishman will refuse
to Join the English army, and when the
time comes 1 hope- to see eighteen million
Irishmen Join with any power that will
assist them in striking for liberty."
The following resolutions were then In
troduced and unanimously adopted:
Â¦\Yherea*. The relKn of the late Queen Victoria
was marked by the most cruel outrages against
human liberty and human civilization, weaker
nations being robbed of their freedom and Inde
pendence, butchered and oppressed on a. scale
unparalleled In hfstory. million* of "subjects be
ing allowed to starve and rot like beasts In the
JunBles of India; and whereas, that reljrn was
marked espÂ«:ally in Ireland by ruthless perse
cution.' by the denial of the fundamental rlKhts
of man, by tne wholesale eviction <}f an hoii'.nt
.peasantry by >n alien and corrupt landlordism
backed up !>y the might of the soldiery of the
Queen, by the olflrlal and uninterrupted roblxny
In over-taxation, by the enforced emigration of
the people of Ireland, by the hounding to the
prison and the scaffold of the nobleiti and.mu't
girted son* of Erin 'who dared like Emmet
aspire after freedom. 1,230.000 dying: during the
reign of starvation, 4,500,000 being forced to flee
to a foreign land, forty coercion acts belntr pass
ed, all bearlns'the signature of the Queen, thus
marking her reign as the darkest and most
tyrannical in English history, unworthy of the
admiration of any free people; and whereas,
tho official expressions of sympathy and condo
lence Â¦which marked the death of Victoria were
i tribute not to Victoria the woman, but t:>
Victoria the Queen and representative or rhat
Â¦Government: be it .., .
Itesolved, That as lovers of liberty and haters
of tyranny and oppression, and. in sympathy
with every peonle rightly struggling 'to be free,
we condemn those otQcfal expressions of flunky-
Ism In tree American cifles. That especially do
we condemn the action of those officials in San
Francisco responsible for the half-masting of
lhÂ« American flasr on our public buildings and
public schools.- to the disgust of the majority
of our citizens. That we commend the action
ot Mayor Van Wyek of New York, who cSaretl
face the torrent of Anglomania abuse and who
had no sympathy to waste on an empire which
In Inimical to free republican institutions. That
our sympathy goes out to the noble IJoVr
women who have suffered and" fought side by
side with their hutfbands, as the wpmen of his
toric LimericK, and who have been made home,
less, childless and husbandless by the soldiery
of Victoria and son.

Grand Opera-Housz.-
ThÂ»> varied bill presented at the Or
pheum last e\'ening was pleasing to the
usual crowded house. Judging by the ap
p'.ause. the hit of the entertainment was
maflf 1 by the French T.usicians, "the Du
mor.dp." who are certainly without riva's
in their lino. Robert Hilliard, the well
known actor, appeared 5n a one-act sketcn
entitled. "The Little Girl." fcunnorted by
bis own company. It tells a story of a
hard-hrnrtod man who neglect? the chil.l
of his divorced wife, i>ut who is brought
to care for the little oi.e by a society man
whose heart ia in the rfeht place. Mr.
HMiiard and his companv should drav
good houses as long cs they appear in
th<Â» city. Katherine Bioodgood, the con â¢
tralto. sings with artistic style, and P-i
pima. the dancer, pleases as of old. Part
of thÂ« act of Wilson and Waring might
he cut out: it is far "too coarse to please.

dear old melodrama. v\ith its delicious In
consistencies, ubiquitous thunderstorms,
hairbreadth escapes, tree blue heroes and
villains galore, kept {he audience on the
thrill and in high trood humor for the
whole evening 1 . .
The drama is well cist and played, and
almost all the t'entral favorites are seen.

Dempsey plays the IS-karat, fast-color.

Central.
When "The Countess Gucki" appeared
in London Mr. Archer -wrote a memorable
criticism upon it." What he said was just
Â»nÂ«i true then: It is no less true and just
now. 1 cannot say it any better than he
did. so 1 shall content myself with follow
ing his lead and, fo far as I can remem
ber them, his words.
Of All of Daly's adaptations from the
German this is probably the emptiest on
record. It has no plot, no characteriza
tion, no wit and but the merest shreds of
humcr. Jt was arranged to pive Miss
Rehan a chance to show off her airs and
jrra.ces. and the author lias evidently con
sidered that Fhe needed no assistance from
him, for "The Countess Gucki" is a mere
doil. and not a coherent doll at that- We
are expected to get up an interest in the
loves of two phantasms who never saw
rach -other until yesterday and who., so
far as the play shows, would not grieve
o'ermuoh if they never saw each -other
after to-morrow. The first half .of the
j^.rFt act is tediously explanatory, and
there is no reason why the curtain should
rife after the second act. the third act
being a mere incoherent farrag-o of half
comic, half-sentimental "business."
Miss Convere is a charming actress, and
made me wish the could he given some
thing better to do than dress up the Daly
dolls; such parrs must be maddening to
Ftape people of intelligence. Mr. Kilgour
mao> it lw-tter Von Keuboff than did Char
lie Richmannâ and this is not paying him
any extra/vagrant compliment. The supÂ»
port was fairly good â certainly not foi:r
times as poor as Mrs. Carter's at. four
tim^s the price. The waits between the
acts were inexcusably tedious.

It was stated 5n this paper last week
that the schooner \V. J. Patterson was
navigated to San Francisco by the cap
tain's wife, the captain â¢ himself being
dangerously ill. Chief .. Officer Harold
Tvedt takes exception to -this statement.
He pays he brought the - vessel to San
Francisco, and, as he can prove that he
has been mate of a 5000-ton steamer and
holds a master's certificate, he thinks he
ought to know something about naviga
tion. "'The long voyage of the Paterson
v.as due to the fact that when I was off
watch the captain's wife would make the
second mate take In the topsails and
stand oft* shore," said Tvedt yesterday.
"When 1 came on deck I would have to
get sail made and stand inshore again.
â¢That's all the navigating the captain's
wife did."

â¢crew, but everything on the wharf was
handled by the longshoremen. On a'l
the big lines the longshoremen hand! 3
the cargo both on the vessel and on the
wharf at a uniform rate of 40 cents an
hour.
December last the Alaska Fishermen's
Packing Company chartered the Harry
Morse, but did not take over the' bark
until the 1st inst. Captain Phillips was.
the only man left aboard last week, at!
the eonfpany decided to send Its own crew
from Astoria. Fifteen men. Including a
chief officer, a cook and a steward, ar
rived "Sunday and went aboard the vessel.
With then came a letter of instruction,
telling Captain Phillips that the men were
to load the vessel^ for which they wtre
to get 33 cents an hour and their meals.
Once the vessel was loaded the men were
to be paid $30 for the run to Astoria, no
matter whether the voyage took a week
or.i month.
When ihe crew of the Morse attempted
to handle the cargo on the wharf yester
day the longshoremen objected because
pome of the crew were non-union men,
and appealed to the Teamsters' Union.
The latter, as a body, -refused to hand'o
ihe Morse's freight, so the wprk. of load
ing the vessel came to a standstill. The
schooner Josephine was alongside with a
cargo of salt, but her crew, being union
men, refused to handle the cargo.
Captain Phillips wired the state of af
fairs to Astoria and received this reply:
Sellers of goods agreed to deliver alongside
ship. If they cannot fulfill their contract sail
at once for Columbia liiver. 'We will pur
che = ? goods here.
"I had to follow my instructions." said
Captain Phillips yesterday. "The extra
5 cents I would willingly have paid, bur
when the longshoremen questioned my .
sailors they found that some of them werv
not union men and refused to work w;Ji
them. That was the last straw. The po
lice have kept everybody off the wharf
and there has been no trouble. Had tho
freight come down we could have loaded
it without any bother." The longshore
men stopped the teamsters at the head of
the wharf, however, and they took the.
merchandise back to the stores."
The Morse has 2$9 tons of ballast in an!
will sail without her cargo this morning. ,

John Lee Mahin, president of the Mahin
branches In New York and St. Louis,.ar
rived in town yesterday, and is registered
at the Palace.
ThisJs Mr. Mahin:^. first visit to the
coast, and he is out here to induce the
larger producers and manufacturers of
California to exploit their goods in tlie
East.' Mr. Mahin is- an advertising expert
and he attends to "the placing; of the ad
vertisements of -a number of well-known
branded products, Including Quaker Oais,
White ftock Mineral Water and the Min
neapolis Flour,
He claims and has substantial argu
ments to prove his assertions that dis
tinctively California products are not ade
quately advertised in the Eact. that they
are thrown on the market and sold for
what they can fetch. With judicious ad
vertising in the Eastern papers, he claims
that a healthy demand would be made for
the goods and that thev would, with this
created demand, sell ;it a higher price.
' "Quaker Oats." he said, "is put up in
attractive packages. It has created a d3
mand, and it dees not matter whether
oats are up or downâ they are always sold
at 10 -cents a package, which Ieave3 a
good margin for the manufacturer.
"If a California ' producer of dried
prunes put them up in un attractive pack
age and advertised them he would put
a standard grade of goods on the market,
that would sell for a higher price. Sup
posing the advertiser was* to tell the East
ern women through the papers how the
prunes could be cooked, or was to publish
dainty ' recipes, It' would appeal to. a
woman and she would b"uy them.
"The success of all manufacturers !s
by creating a demand for their goods; if
you" do not draw people"s attention to a
certain matter it will pass unnoticed. Ip
the Kast I see a lot of canned fruits from
California, but for the life of me I can
not tell you any-distinct brand. With a
manufacturer advertising his canned
goods, telling their distinct superiority,
they will sell at the rate of two to one U>
the brand that is not advertised."
ExpÂ§rt Mahin Tells Why Cal
ifornia Producers Should
Exploit Goods.

VICTIMS OF CLEVER FORGER.
Many. Checka/Axe. Discovered to Be
Bogus When They Are Sent
to the Banks..
The police are looking for a forger who
has recently victimized a number of peo
ple by passing bogus checks. ' His latest
victim Is Adolph Me-yef, a hardware jpier
chant at 1510 Devlsadero street. The for:
ger used the name of C. R. Crowell, su
perintendent of the Cemetery Association,
and his imitation of Crowell's signature
was almost perfect.
According to the story Meyer told to
the police yesterday afternoon an elderly
man. claiming to be James T. Wright,
came to his store and presented a check
on the First National Bank for about J50.
He stated- that he had been employed In
the cemeteries And had received the paper
in payment. The signature affixed was
that pf Crowell, and Meyer, knowing- the
last named gentleman,. did not hesitate
to accept it. When the check was pre
sented for payment the signature was de
clared a 'forgery and the matter waÂ« re
ferred to the. police.
Crowell was surprised at the clever imi
tation of his handwriting. Tho other
writing on the check was penned by an
other person, which' the alleged Wright
explained.' by saying that a bookkeeper
had written thÂ» names and amounts on
all the employes' orders for money- and
had passed them over" to the superintend
ent f6r his signature.
There have been a number of bogus
check cases reported to the police recently
and It Is supposed that the same person
who victimized Meyer Js successfully
working the town.
The Scotch Bawbee.
In Scotland the halfpenny Is called a

hrr earliest infancy, and her "wee" face
was cnrrÂ»v<>d upon the Scottish halfpen
nies at the time of her coronation jn 1543,
when she was but nine months old. A

CHINESE SLAVERY
MUST BE STOPPED
NORINE SCHNEIDER, "Sir" Har
ry Westwood Qooper's. otherwise
Dr. Ernest Moore Chad wick's,
simple girl bride, slipped quietly
into town Sunday afternoon and
yesterday presented herself before Cap
tain Seymour and told her touching tale
of an eventfÂ«rf five days of married life.
Norine had scarcely slipped the wedding
ring on before her troubles began. They
i were mental troubles invented by Cooper
and with which he hoped to serve his
purposeâ protection for himself and con
tinued love and respect from the poor girl
he had so terribly deceived. Cooper played
his game with telegrams, sent by himself
to himself, but ornamented with forged
signatures, generally that of the mother
of his wife. Mra. Marie Schneider.
The first telegram rfached the poor lit
tle bride aboard the >^3st-bound train at
Sacramento. It pretended to tell how Mr.
Schneider,' the beloved father of Nora,
had been tempted by Chadwlck's wealth
and fell. The telegram read as follows:
To Dr. Chadwlck on trainâ Dan has
tone to Reno. and taken your money and papers
with him. For God's *ake follow hlm-takel
Nora she can Influence him to do right. I will
I follow next train. Am heartbroken
The news conveyed by this telegram was
a terible blow to Nora. She sobbed and
wept and would not be comforted. Now
her tears were for her beloved parent, of
whom she would believe no wrong, and
theti again for her devoted husband, who
had lost his all at the hands of her father.
When Cooper got his bride in this frame
of mind he made his next move.
"My darling." he Raid to her. "we must
go on to Reno and capture your father
so I may reclaim my wealth. Of course,
the moment your -father hears we are In
Reno he will fly or go into hiding. There
fore, to circumvent him. we will change
our name and hereafter we will be known
as Mr. and Mrs. Humphreys."
Naturally the broken-hearted girl con
sented, but she begged and pleaded that
her father should not be prosecuted.
"This much I promise you." said her
hueband. "if they should want to arrest
your mother on the ground that sho is his
accomplice I will take her sentence for
her and serve the term in Jail in her place.
Then again, if we are known as Mr. and
Sirs. Humphreys, the authorities will not
call upon you or me to idcntjfv your
father as the sruilty man."
As "Mr. and Mrs. Humphreys" Cooper
and his bride journeyed on to Reno and
when they arrived there Cooper 'said he
felt sure detectives wrere on his track.
"Detectives! Why. how could that be?"
asked the unsuspecting wife.
"It is all on account of your father,
explained Coowr and the* cullible little
country girl was satisfied and grateful.
From Reno "Mr. and Mrs. Humphreys"
journeyed on to Winnemucca. IJere
Cooper concluded that his wife ought to
begin to reolace some of the Jewels her
father had ""stolen." A magnificent dia
mond ring, valued at J270, was decided
upon and ordered to be mado small
enough to tit Nora's slender finger. Â¦ A
check of the same variety, so plentiful
'with Cooper; was given in- payment and
the> ring ordered sent as soon as repaired.
The jeweler, however, was a wise gentle
man and the ring never reached "Mrs..
Humphreys.""
It.wns at Ogden. however, that, the
most exciting scenes of the honeymoon
transpired. The couple registered at
Reed"? Hotfl, the most fashionable hos
telry in the town, when the following
telegram came to disturb' tnem:
February 27th, 1901.

pelled to boâ make Erned happy, he is your
best friend-Jx* true to him alwaysâ will write
ycu In a day or twoâ we will all meet soon.
MARIE SCHNEIDER.
Cooper's wife received the telegram and
handed it to him for perusal. He glanced
It hurriedly over anJ then madly seizing
a revolver he put it -to his head, crying
wildly: , ,
"This Is awful. I can stand no more. I
miiHt put an end to alj this."
The poor little gin bride from peaceful
Crockett was besMe herself with fear.
She cried to her husband to put the gun
down. 'but to no avail. Finally he rolled
his eyes and roughly commanded ber to
leave the room. The half-fainting child
prepared to nip from the apartment when
hrr husband tailed her back-. He flu";:
the revolver to one side and holding out
his arms cried. "Cozr.a to me, Bweett.eari;
I will endure it all lor your sake. I love
you so. I can not bear to be parted from
you."
After that it was "on to Chicago; we
will capture. them there.'
On Thursday 'evening all preparations
for the Chjcago trip .were made. At mid
night Cooper and h>. bride went down to
the Ogden depot and were told that their
train left at 4 o'clock in the morning.
They returned to the hotel and decided
â¢to rest until it was time to Btart. They
were in their room but a few moments
when a knock was heafd at the door.
"Lie still." said Cooper to bis wife,
"don't make a sound." The knock at the
door was repeated again and again and
finally the Twife paid, "Ask who is there.
If you. do not I will." >
Cooper did as his wife asked, him ani
to his question came the response:
"The Chief of Police/ Open the-door."
Â¦Cooper, pale "and trembling, obeyed the
command and the Chief entered paying,
"Hello. Harrv. don't you remember me?"
"No." replied Cooper. -â¢ â¢ .'
Bisks in Traveling.
The comparative safety of marine travel
under modern conditions is strikingly il
lustrated in the annual report of Inspec
tor General Dumont of the steamboat In
spection service. According to hla fig
ures. â¢ 600,000.000 persons were carried last
year by steam vessels within the Juris
diction of the United States. Of these 20*5
lost their lives.- of whom only +1 were
passengers, the remaining 162 having
been employes. The relative safety of
this mode of travel is shown by the fact
that of the' 500.000.000 passengers carried
by the railroads of the country during the.
same period 221 were killed and. 2345 wem
Injured. Of the railway employes 2237
were killed and 2S.743 were Injured. Of
others who sufferedâ tramps, trespassers
and persons not In trains â 46SO were killed
and â¬176 were Injured, thus making a
grand total for the railroads of 7133 killed
and 47.S70 Injured. All thlfl would seem
to indicate that if there is anything more
dangeoua than going to sea it is staying
on dry land.â Colfax Gazette.
"Why, I saw you in the prison at San

.All this while the poor little wife was
trembling with fear and too bewildered to
hear rightly or think. .
"Hello, Nora," said the Chief, turning to
her, "where Is your hat?"
The green hat decked with plumes was
produced.
"That Is the hat they telegraphed the
description of," said the Chief, and then
turning again to the frightened girl he
said: "Your mother wants you.. I am
going to send you back to her."
Before Cooper was conveyed to the jail
the Chief told his deceived wife his story.
During the recital Cooper Implored her
not to listen to the officer nor believe him.
Â¦ "It Is not true," he cwied to her. "I am
true, am honest and I love -you." His last
request to the arresting officer was that
the woman he had so deceived should be
treated well.
* See that she goes to the best hotel and
gets the best of everything," was his last
cry.
Previous to starting for home the de
ceived girl went in answer to Cooper's
prayerful summons to say good-by to him.
He was behind the bars and cried to her
to continue to love him, and above all not
to believe what they were saying of him.
It was -a pitiful tale -as poor Nora
Schneider told her story. The events of
the oast few days have so disturbed the
child that she could scarcely string her
facts together. She Jumped from one awful
scene to another, and there was the con
stant repetition of a pleading, "I forget:,
lpt me think." This girl that captured
the fancy of the daring forger and notor
ious jailbird has a spirituelle face lit up
by a pair of fine brown eyes and framed
with an abundance of wavy brown hair.
She is swept and charming and simple as
only a very young country' girl can be.
Yesterday she waa attired in the plain
gown she was married In and went away
In. the only gown that she has worn since
she got the telegram purporting to come
from her mother, and reading, "Do as
Ernest tells you."
"Of course I loved him," she said, while
discussing her pa(nÂ£r.l experience. "He
gave mo so many things, or promised to
give them to me) an<i he loved me so
deeply and -was bo klml to me. But since
I have learned who' lie Is my loVe has'
turned to hatp. I hate him, now and shall
hate him for all tlm-3 ','
Mrs. Schneider, the mother of the un
fortunate girl wife, turned over to"-Cap
taln Seymour yesterday a letter which
Cooper had written to C. F. Humphrey,
the attorney, but which, he "forgot" to.
mail. It was written on one of Cooper's
bogus letterheads and read' as follows:
C T. Humphrey* ' Esq.. San FrancWco â D*ar
Sir and Brother: I regret having -to Inform
you that my engaternent to Miss Xorlne
Schneider has b*>pn broken* off through the
unmerited Insults offered to me by her mother.
Mrs. Schneider pave me to understand very
plainly that my actions were questionable, and
ferllnp that I had done, all that man could <Jo
to satisfy her. I could not In Justice to myself
stand this, hence the rupture. You will take
this as final and revoke' all that has t>een

The wtll cf Mrs. Mary A. He.narle.
widow of the late D. V. B. Henarle. waa
filed for probate yesterday. Mrs. Hen
arie died February 27, leaving an estate
valued at $110,000. It consists of money
oh deposit in local banks, $K>.650 3Â»: 20U
shares â¢ of Spring Valley Water Works
btock. $18,800; 20>> shares San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company stock, $3600;
67 shares First National Bank of Stock
ton, $12,000. and Jewelry and other per

Decedent bequeaths $10,000 each to the
California Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children and the San Fran

elty to Animals; $1000 each to the Selecf
men of Westford, Mass., and the Select

Emm& L. Byam; $200 each to the chil
dren of a brother, Alfred Lowa, and a lot
and Improvements at Pino ajad Taylor
streets, to an adopted daughter, Maude
Norton.-
The residue of the estate is bequeathed
in trust to B. F. Brlsac and Maude Nor
ton for the following purposes: To pay
decedent's son, George A. Hasley, $100 a
month; to pay Benjamin Norton, son of
Maude Norton, $5oOO upon his reaching the>
age of 23 years; to pay Harry and Amanda
"Wlsrgln of Loa Angeles JSOO. In the event
of the estate being found to be more" than
sufficient to satisfy all legacies, annuities
and devises the surplus la bequeathed in
equal shares to Benjamin Norton and to
the' children of decedent'9 sisters, Lu
clnda Hartwell, Emily Byam and Sarah
C. Rockwell.
Decedent's will was executed Septem
ber 29, 1&97, and was signed in the pres
ence of the testatrix by James P. Gaff
ney. The execution of the instrument was
witnessed by George E. Davis, M. D., and
Annie E. Rogers.
For several years prior to the death of
the late D. \. B. Ilenarle. who was a
pioneer liquor dealer, he did not live with
his wife. Upon his death his will waa
filed and showed that he had left the
greater part of his fortune- to distant rel
atives. Mrs. Henaxie was compelled to
institute a contest to the will to protect
her own Interests. The action Is still
pending. It will in all probability â¢ bÂ«
carried on by the trustees named in her
will, and If they are successful about
$200,000 more will be added to the esiate
of Mrs. Henarle and will bfe- distributed
amons her heirs.
The City Attorney was directed by the
Board of Supervisors yesterday to file an
opinion whether the city has the power
to compel the Spring Valley Water Com
pany to lay water mains necessary for
adequate f.re protection in various por
tions of th<Â» city. Brandensteln suggested
that this course be taken before the final
adoption of the ordinance fixing the water
rates for the next fiscal year.
A rommunlr-illon was received from
Ch!ef Engineer Schussler in which he
Ftstcs that the company positively de
clines to accept the recommendation of
Fire Chief Sullivan that 49S new fire hy
<5rantÂ« be set throughout the city. Schuss-
Jer say* this would necessitate the. laying
of 11*. 2W feet of eight-inch pipe, 66,430 feet
of twelve-inch pipe and 6910 feet of either
twenty-Jcur or twenty-two-inch pipe. To
do this 124.900 fret of the pipe system now
In use would have to be abandoned or
paralleled by the new system, causing
an outlay for new .construction of be
tween $400,000 and $500,000. The proposition
\f declined, r.ot only because the general i
allowances in the water rate ordinance
are inadequate, but might be construed
as an acceptance of the ordinance which
the company declines, concludes Schuss-
Irr. This* probably means that the com
pany will contest the ordinance in the
court-

The following. communication from Â¦Wil
liam R. Dudley, professor- of botany at
Stanford University/ Bhould prove of In
terest to all persons interested in the pres
ervation of the California redwoods, a bill
Concerning which is now bef or.e the State
Legislature:
This Is probably a critical tlmÂ» with thw
bill now before the State Legislature which
has for its purpose the creation, by purchase,
of a redwood park. in the heart of the Santa
Cruz Mountains.
I cannot learn of -any -person or Interest
â¢which does not wish well the effort in this
direction. But there are many In the State
who do not understand Just how wonderful
these redwood forests of the California coast
appear to- thOEe who, .through extensive, travel,
known the great natural features of this globe.
There are practically no redwoods anywhere
In the world, excepting along one-half of the
California coast line mountains, and I want
to call the attention of your readers to what
the man best Informed In all America on the
forests of the world' said of the redwoods last
July. This gentleman haa considerable wealth
as well aa learning and haa seen the forests
of Europe of Japan and of Eastern Asia, as
well as those of all parts of North America.
The Government has twice selected htm for
the most- important positions in relation to
forest matters within its gift, the forestry
work of- the tenth census (vol. 9 of that work)
and the head of the United States Forestry
Commission of 1896 and 1897. This latter com
mission was a special advisory one, asked for
by Congress, through the National Academy of
Vrofessor Charles 8. Sargent, '. director of the
Arnold Arboretum of. Harvard University,
writes In the. New York Evening Post:
"The future of the redwoods of the coast
elves cause for great anxiety. This is a tree
second In trunk diameter only to the- Bierra
gequoia. It is a much taller tree; the tallest
of all North American trees and probably
taller than any of the Australian t-ucalypti,
which have usually been deemed the tallest
trees in the world. To my mind the redwood
is a more beautiful tree than the Sierra 8e
nuola. and it Is economically more valuable.
The whole of the land covered by this tree
has been allowed to pass from, the control of
the Government, and a few years, fifty per
haps, will see the destruction of the original
redwood forests. . ' â¢ .. '
"What ought to be done for the credit of
America and American civilization is to pur
chase through act of Congress or by_ individual
effort, a block of a few thousand acres of this
forest with the Idea of preserving It for all
time It Ms doubtful If the Government can
be got to do this, but possibly some rich man
or men can be found glad to Immortalize
themselves by saving from destruction -.one of
the great marvels of the world, for this red
wood forest is the most stupendous and pro
ductive forest that exists. Unless" a redwood
reservation ts made, all trace of the original
redwood forest will disappear before the end
of 'the next century."
Every word of this quotation deserves
thought. Observe what he says of its ceftaln
destructionâ and this is borne out by careful
calculationâ and work. Oallfornlans. for a noble
park of these noble trees, before it is too late!
He says It Is the "most stupendous and pro
ductive forest that exists." This Is all true.
Not In Eastern Asia, not In the tropics Is its
like to be seen. It Is because of the great
elze. combined with the great height of the
Individual tree, and of the density of the
forest. And it should be . reme.nbered that
these qualities which make this forest so pro
ductive to the lumberman are also exactly
thos<Â» which awaken enthusiasm and wonder
In the beholder, and attract travelers from
every part of the world.
Theodore Hlttell, the historian of California,
ha* said: "In the eyes of many persons the
redwood is the most beautiful tree that grows,
and the redwood forest is the most beautiful
forest of the world." J-et me add that the most
beautiful tract of all the redwood forests of the
coast Is the Hlg Basin tract. This is not a
random remark, but made after seeing all the
forests of consequence in California, and .some
of the most Important of the redwood forests
north of San Francisco. This la because of- the
charm of. variety in the other forest trees,
which does, not seem to Interfere with the state
llness and abundance of the redwood Itself,. and
lends a half-tropical air of luxuriance wanting
In the dark and solemn forests of- Humboldt
County. It Is due to the tanbark oak, the
madrone, the Douglas spruce, the boxlcaf huc
kleberry, the aralla and a large number of
smaller trees or shrubs.
If this forest Is not naved this year It Ms
doomed to destruction. I do not hesitate to say
that considering the dellRht future generations
will have In this forest, the value it will be
educationally and intrinsically to the State, Its
purchase Is a duty, of hlgh'er patriotism than
any other required of the Legislature.

The right kind of food will work won-

to a healthy one, and by the same rule
keep a person in good health.
Arthur W. Fanning:, 14 Throop street,
Chicago. III., had euch a remarkable ex-
perience himself with Grape-N'uts
that he recommended it to a friend f<)r his
chtld, for whom the parents were unable
to find food that would agree.
It was purposed the child's stomach had
bf-tn ruined by the usa. of medicines.
When he was put on Grape-N'uts he be-

"I will wager that, although he is but
three years o!d now, he is the bent single
handed customer the PoBtum Cereal Co.

ctrong ajid is in perfect condition. I have
received tharks many times from his
rjiother for brSnelnc Grape-Xuis Food to
their attention.^ The whole family arc us-

"My own experience was remarkable. I
had for year? a stomach trouble. I got
f=o Icculd not cat anything for breakfast
except an orange, all solid food and meat
being cut of the question.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ The -Eastern and foreign markets
showed no particular change.
; The weekly figures were rather more favor
able than, for several weeks. The American
visible supply decreased 303,000 bushel*. . The
world's shipments were as follows. In quarters:
Russian. 75.000; Danublan, nil; Argentine, 158,
000: Australian, K,C00. The quantity on
sage increased -2G0.O00 bushels. The smallness
of the . Russian-Danubtan ehlpments attracted
attention .at several markets and led to" the
query whether those sources of supply were
getting, short of their exportable surplus.
Chicago opened steady with a moderate de
mand. ' The commission houses had few buy
ers and the scalpers sold. ...
This market was dull, with a slight decline

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The feature of the Vegetable market was the
arrival of 2350 boxes of Tomatoes from Mexico.
There were plenty of Tomatoes on the market
before. Arrivals of Vegetables from Los An
geles were also very heavy, being 216 eacks and
123 boxes, and the market wa3 accordingly
weak. Good Asparagus and Rhubarb showed
no weakness. Cucumbers dragged.
Onions cpntinue weak, and though holde'ro
are trying to get out at high prices, they are
not succeeding very. well. At the same time
the feeling is less demoralized in these goods.
Potatoes show no . change â¢ worthy of note.

Â¦A writ of mandate waÂ« Issued by Judge
Murasky yesterday directing the Board
of Education to reinstate Mrs. Mary
Mead Morrissey as a principal in the
School Department. At the time of the
consolidation of classes in the John Swett
Evening "School ; an order was made by
the Board of Education retiring Mrs. Mor
rissey. She forthwith filed a petition for
a writ of mandate, asserting that she had
not been legally removed and that legal
cause for her removal did not exist. In
Its answer the Board of Education, among
other points of defense, contended that,
as Mrs. Morrissey 'had been married dur
ing her Incumbency, she had violated tho
rules of the board, - and for . this reason.
If no other, her retirement, was valid, r
Â¦ In his opinion Judge Murasky sustains
the position heretofore taken by other
Judges of the- Superior Court, holding 1
that a teacher has a legal right to marry
and that such marriage does not furnish
legal grounds for i the retirement of a
teacher.. The court also holds that no
other legal ground Â¦-; for Mrs. . Morrissey's
retirement* exists, and hence orders the
writ of mandate to issue as prayed for.
ORDERS REINSTATEMENT
OF MARY M. MORRISSEY
Judge Murasky Holds That Her Re
tirement by Board of Education
Was Illegal.

. Mr. ' Fitzpatrick then made a plea for
an open- session, saying that the previous
action of the board was taken from a
moral standpoint. Ap the.board, by pass
ing the ordinance, had legalized and legit-;
imatized horse racing,' he could not see
why the board should so limit the season
as to make it unprofitable to the racing
association. He asserted that the Tan
fcran people had been given no notice of
the contemplated action of the board, but
that the board, when it first granted them
a license under an ordinance -permitting
unlimited racing, invited them to' come to
this county and make valuable and per
manent Improvements. To now reduce the
number .of racing days to thirty-five In
each year, he said, would be nothing more
than a confiscation of the association,^
property. The speaker then dwelt more
fully upon the petition before the -board,
saying that it would be impossible to pro
cure 600 more representative men than
had signed the present petition. He called,
the attention of the board to > the - report
of the recent : Grand Jury, whh:h favored
the \TanfOran people on â¢ account of : tne
money they would spend in the county In
the way of labor/supplies and taxes..
Rev. J. J.- Martin replied to Mr. Fitz

Pleads for Continuous Racing.
The effect of the ordinance Is that there
is now no limit to the racing season: that
the San PYancisco Jockey Club may now
continue its races 365 days in the year
without fear of molestation. â¢
The attitude of the Supervisors was
made clear before a vote on the ordinance
was taken. Their action on the petition
dandled all doubt. Supervisors McEvoy
and McCormick stood by their former ac
tion- Supervisors Eikcrenkotter and Colt
man adhered to theirs; Supervisor De
benedetti. on whom the fate of the ordi
nance depended, and who voted on Janu
arv 21 for a limited season, voted for tno
oruinance. and the victory was won by the

at the last meeting. He asserted that it
was unfair to the petitioners to kill tho
petition' by merely ordering It filed with
out either granting or denying the prayer
thereof, and contended that the COO repre
sentative men whose names wero attached
to the petition were entitled to some con
sideration at the hands of the board.

Fitzpatrick. He said he did . not J>elievo

No Limit on Racing.
REDWOOD CITY. March 4.â By a vote
of 3 to 2 the San Mateo County Board oÂ£
Supervisors this afternoon repealed ord 1 
nance No. 168, which limited racing In this
county to thirty-five days in each year.
When the board convened the petition
asking for the repeal of the ordinance
was resurrected. This petition had been
received and placed on file at the last,
meeting upon motion of Supervisor Elker
enkotter. Klkerenkotter did not intend
that his motion should have this effect,
believing that his motion meant that the
prayer of the petitioners be granted. Ho
rectified his mistake to-day by moving
that -the petition be recalled. This mo
tion was adopted by a bare majority vote.
Eikercnkotter then presented an ordi
nance repealing ordinance No. 163, passe-1
by the board on January 21 last, whcih
limited the racing season to thirty-live
days in each year, the season to com
mence on February 5. The roll was called
on this ordinance, Supervisors Eikeren
kotter, Coleman and Debenedetti voting
for its passage, and Supervisors McEvoy
and McCormick voting against It.
When the bill came up for a vote Comte
moved to strike out the enacting clause,
the effect of which would have been to
nullify its provisions. The motion was
seconded by Connor, but It was lostâ

"I am here to protest against the pas

course would .be his Honor replied that
he would consider the matter in thA or

was sure of the necessary votes was ap
parent when' he asked for a postponement
on the measure two weeks ago. On that
occasion Hotaling and Sanderson were ab
sent, which would have defeated the or
dinance, as it would nave received only
nine votes. For awhile yesterday it
looked as though final passage would bo
deferred for another week, as Fortana
and D'Ancona, who voted in its favor, did
not come in until the meeting was well
advanced. -: â¢,
Just before the voting Tobin, the author
of the bill, made the statement that he
desired to assume . all the responsibility
for the adoption of the ordinance which
legalizes the terrible vice of gambling
within the precincts of a race track, -lie
further stated that he did not 'ntend ever
to shirk the responsibility for me opening
of Ingleside. In other words, Tobln takes
upon himself the shouldering of all blame
in the matter of suicides, murders, defal
cations,'robberies and the lone train of
other evils incident to the operations of
the-race track gambling Interests. Tobln's
shoulders may be broad, but it is a fear
ful responsibility for one man to assume,
and no one will care to share it with him.
The ordinance permitting horse racins
to be carried on for a period of thirty-six
days in each year and making it lawful
to gamble thereon within the track in
closure was finally passed by the Board
of Supervisors yesterday. The vote on
the measure was the same as when it
was passed to print at last Monday's
meeting, with the exception ' that Reed's
absence reduced the number against it
from seven to six.
W. J. Martin, R. H. Thornton and ex-
Supervisor H. Q. Tilton spoke In favor of
a repeal of the ordinance. Supervisor De
benedetti said that he had been "pestered
to death" ever since the passage of the
ordinance by his % constituents and other
representative men of the county. He
thought the. great majority of the peopl.-j
of the county favored a repeal of the pres
qnt law, and that as he was only the rep
resentative of the people, he should be
guided in his actions by the popular wish.
He desired it to be understood, however,
that he was opposed to an unlimited sea
son, but he believed the length of the sea
son could be considered hereafter. ihe
board had taken action too hastily and
without due consideration, and he would,
therefore, vote to grant the prayer of the
petition and to repeal the ordinance.
Chairman McEvoy said that the Tan
foran people had been given every oppor
tunity to be 'present at the meetings of
the board and protest against the ordi
nance, and had had ample opportunity to
present data for the consideration of the
board before the I ordinance was acted
upon. If he had to do It over again, the
chairman declared, he would not allow the
racing association a single day. Like De
benedetti, he had been beset by friends
of the Tanforan people, but he considered
he had done right when he voted for a
thirty-five day limit, and would not now
recede from his position.
Supervisor McCormick. on roll call,
voted no on the repeal, and expressed
himself as unalterably opposed to unlim
ited racing. '"' : '
As It now stands, the ordinance passed
to-day will hot go into effect until the 19th
of this, month, and the racing season un
der the thirty-five day ordinance will end
on March 12. If races be run aÂ± Tanforan
after the 12th and before the 19tn it will be
in violation of the law. -X>

racing on principle and was in favor of
abolishing the sport altogether as it was
conducted, but if it could not be stopped
entirely, it should at least be regulated in
the manner In which ordinance No. 16$
regulated it. Mr. Martin made a bitter
attack upon the report of the Grand Jury,
declaring that the Grand Jury had usurp
ed functions which did not belong to that
bedy when it brought in such a report.
The Grand Jury's jurisdiction, he eald,
was confined to an examination of the af
fairs of the public officials of the county
and to the finding of indictments against
persons violating thelaws. and not to the
encouragement of gambling and other
forms of crime which followed in the wake
of a racetrack.

Rev. Dr. F. Doane, "contained nearly 4000
names. Mothers and sisters signed that
petition. I believe that 'the hand that
rocks the cradle is the hand that rules

up and see what was tb* matter. When

crying and 1 could hear her say to the
little fellow. 'Tell them what I've done
and where I'm going.'
"I kept my eye on the couple and laid
my whip down, as I had a suspicion that,
she meant to rto away with herself. PreUy
soon, quick as a Hash. I saw the girl leave
the boy and start to climb up the fou*
foot fence. I lost no time in running to
her. She had almost succeeded in getting
over when I reached her. Catching her
by the skirt, I dragged her back to tho
bridge again. She pleaded with me to
let her go. 'Let me die, let me die; I don't
want to live.' she kept saying.
"After I had succeeded in pacifying tho
girl I turned her ever to a young man
who had come up while we were talking.
It seems he knew her. He said he woultl
take care of her and that was the last I
saw of her."
Burns describes the girl as of Portu

may have been IS or 20 years of age. The
clothing wa3 neat and consisted of a white

According to Mr. Josselyn's statements
Cordes purchased the secret of a receipt
for a powerful explosive two yeais ago
(rom a. retired German army officer, who
for fome unexplained reason did not wish
to be connect eÂ«! with the discovery. Aftor
<'ordeÂ» made his purchase he discovered
that nome ingredient was missing from
the formula, it having been left out either
rÂ»y design or accident. When Cordes
looked around for his army officer he
found him gone. He left ostensibly for
Mexico, but Oordea was never able to get
into communication with him.
The man told Oordes that the explosive
xvould startle the world and revolutionize
warfare, eo Conic? set about to work out
the secret .of the missing ingredient. He
experimented with thousands of chemi
cals, spending- a fortune in that way. He
rejected the isolated Bfte near the tidal
canal, where <he explosion of Saturday
occurred, for !ns workshop.
**I think Mr. '"orde.- must have h'.t upon
the serret." said Mr. Jnsselyn this after
noon, "else whv should he be working at
Fuch unreasonable hour* as he is paid to
have worked? He went to his little plant
at 12 o'clock at right and stayed there till
5 o'clock in the- morning. He could not
have done that iinle^p he had some good
reason. Irately he has talked about his
pxperimoiits â¢even! times' at my office.
He once tried to get my father interested
in the explosive, but.be would not listen
to thp propojdtfawi onihecount of the miss-
Ing Â« L nr-nt. No doubt Mr. Cordt-s was
looking forward to tho time when he
could t-e\\ the tecret to the Government,
and in his hurry he neelocted to take pre
caution. It meant a fortune to hin; if he
tv&s Eccoessfttt."*
Mr. Josscljn Is positive that Cordes lost
his life through his peisistency in experi
menting with a high explosive which he
had set his heart on perfecting. He
worked early and late, sometimes not

In the detention wavti of the Receiving
Hospital is confined a man of 35 years who
this morning tried to commit suicide by
throwing himself in front of a moving
Haywards electric car at Eighth and
Washington streets. The stranger, for
no one has identified 1:1m, was saved- by
the prompt action of the motorraan froin
being ground to death. The car wa*
stopped so quickly that the desperate man
was only slightly bruised, lie waa ar
rested and sent to the hospital to be held
for examination as to his sanltv.
To the attendants and all visitors who
sought information th<= patient was dumb.
Efforts to induce him to speak v/er* un
availing. He acted as one who did not
know what had occurroi or what was tak
ing place around him. The hospital at
taches were baffled hi their search ior
some means of identilication, as there was
nothing on the man's person to furnish
a trace in that direction.
The patient appeared as if he were In
a stupor, but the doctors could find no
symptoms nor evidence of any kind that
he had taken any dru? or poison. After
close watch for several hours they de
cided that their unknown guest was de
mented.
Clad In ordinary garb, the natient ap
peared to be a laborer, but that is all tha*.
could be gleaned from a personal inspec
tion of the silent occupant cf the ward.
The doctors are hopeful that before twen
ty-four hours have passed their strang"
patient will be able to talk. It was known
that he has not lost the power of speech,
because he said a few incoherent words
on the way to the hospital. The Lunacy
Commissioners wttl examine the case to-

with a good following in the quarters
where Federal influence is supposed to
prevail. But there came a deadlock. It
appeared that Marian tc had a strong
yearning to succeed himself. Then Mrs.
Church appeared on' the scene. She had
resided quietly at San Leandro for sev
eral years since her retirement from the
superlntendency of the Beulah Home. Her
work among the sick at the county in
firmary kept her busily employed. She
remembered her old associations with the
President, and on th-Â» eve of his second
inauguration v Mrs. Cluirch arrived In
Washington prepared to make her appli
cation for the office for which the men
were contesting:. In her brief dispatch
she simply announces her victory. Her
friends - are 'awaiting the successful
woman's return to hear the story. Mr.
Floyd was in San Leandro to-day, where
he secured the fixtures and other details
for San Leaniro's postmistress as soon
as she shall arrive with her commission.
The office pays a salary of $1200 a year.

Samuel M. Shortridge gave a short dis
sertation on California . , hospitality, and
was at his best as the orator of the night.
He said he knew that these visiting guests
wanted to learn' something about the wild
and woolly West, of which they, had read
so- much and had seen so little, but was
glad that the opportunity for personal
Inspection made the tales of orators un
necessary. . â¢ Â¦ Â¦--- Â¦'Â¦
Potentate Winsor was thoroughly alive
to the occasion and said a whole lot of
nice things about! California. He was glad

On account of his position at the Im

Martin spoke of the bravery and fortitude
of the women durinsr the siege of. Peking:,
cf their cheerfulness and the encourage

defending the fortifications. It was the
Chinese superstition of the presence of
the railroads and steamboats, he thought,
that prompted the uprising.

The body of a supposed victim of t!ie
Rio de Janeiro clÂ«astrt- was washed ashoro
at El Campo yesterday afternoon and tha
remains were taken to San Rafael by
Coroner Edpn of Marin County. It mf
thoucht Â£t first thct the body was that
of a Chin^s^. but an examination showed
it to be that of a white man. The re
mains are those of a man about i feet 6
inches tall, with a bald head. The body
was clad in a white . woolen sweater.
ftriped pants and gray woolen socks.
From the condition of the body it Is
thought that the man was making efforts
to remove the sweater at the time of h!s
death. The garment was half way off
and covered the head completely. N<>
papers were found on the body, but S25 It;
change were found in the pockets of the
trousers.
Two investigations were conducted yes
terday on the loss of the Rio. The United
States Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers
continued their inquiry as to the respon
sibility for the disaster, and another in
vestigation was made into the failure of
the lookout of the Fort Point life-saving
nation to heed the Rio's call for assist
ance.
Jordan Is Contradicted.
The contention of Pilot Jordan that he
did not want to bring the Rio into port
In a fog and that Captain Ward insisted
on doing so received a severe setback yes
terday. Jordan has Insisted all along that
he was not responsible for the loss of the
steamship, and th<- Pacitic Mail Company
claimed that a pilot was onlv a guide to
the captain, who alone had power to say
whrn a ship should come into porO
Herman Oelrichs. who for many years
â¢was connected with the North German
I>!<-yd Steamship Company, sent a tele
p:am Â«">n Saturday" to Gustav H. Schwab,
New York manager of that steamship
line, asking what rule was observed by the
company as to the authority of a pilot
rnd captain in bringing a ship Into port.
The answer received yesterday by Mr.
Oelrichs was as follows: "Pilot absolute
respecting course of ship entering port,
but we should never absolve captain from
all responsibility here."
Freight Clerk Inplehart of the Rio de
Janeiro also testified yesterday before In
spectors BoTles and Bulger that he had
be*n on \-f^r friendly terms with Captain
Ward, and that the lattervery often dis
cussed with him the question of entering
jv<rt.
Inerlehurt testified that .on the night the
Rio lay at anchor, and after the pilot had
been en hoard for sorr.e hours, he (Ingle
harti had pone to the captain's cabin to
get his reports signed.
Startling Testimony Given.
Wh^n asked by the inspectors if he had
held any conversation with Captain Ward
as to the tshi:> entering port, Inglehart
made the following startling statement:
"C'apLain Ward paid to me: 'This is
hell; we will enly have five days in port
now. The Dilot wants to take us in to

the ship or passengers, and perhaps lose
my position. I'll stay hÂ«>re a week before

Chief Engineer Herlihy was recalled to
too witness stand and admitted that he
had violated the rules of the Pacific Mail
Company by not being at his post and
having all his men on duty, as required
He was shown a copy of the rules, and
then paid:
"I will admit that all the men were not
on duty that morning. I am responsible
for that. I was not on duty myself, and
I zm the chief offender."
Herlihy maintained that ho heard no
orders or signals to abandon ship and
m;.n xhf boau. and that he did not think
the s=hii> was about to sink.
"I did not order my men up on deck to
rnan the boats/' said Herlihy, "because
I heard no orders to' that effect."
ThÂ« witness then described the various
bulkhead* of the Bio and the. condition of
their- water-tight doors. The witness

abaft the main bulkhead on account of the
rapid t-ntry of water Into the engine and

He told how he had gone to the various

.. "perything: tore wide open." he said
whep the ship started to plunge down"
He told of the awful screams of the peo

described how be clung to wreckage and
wes picked up by a boat. He fixed the
time from the striking to the sinking of
the ship at ten minutes. Witness also tes

given to abandon ship and man the boat.-.

'1 went to my room to dress," said
Borjr. "after I rao out when the shin
etruck. I asked the third assistant ene-i
neer what the matter was and he aske.I
me if I did net have sense, enough to
know when the ship was aground. Whll*
I was In my room, which was on the main
deck. I heard the captain give the ord~r
for everybody to come on deck and man
the boats. The captain said the women
m-jFt so in the boats first I heard the
captain talking to the chief engineer at
that time. They were both on the main

This portion of the testimony of the
witness created a sensation, as Chief En
gineer Herllhy Jias. sworn that lie neve
heard a command for the boats to be
manned or the shin abandoned and for
lhat reason he had allowed his men to re
main on the main d*Â»ck, where they haJ

testified that the Fhip struck at 5:20 a. m
noting the time hy the quartermaster's
clock. This would show that the ship was
nf.nni for twoÂ»ity-four minutes after th<Â»
time she struck.
Th- investigation will be resume to

SEA CIVES UP
BUT ONE BODY
FROM THE RIO
Owing to the unsatisfactory condition
of affairs. in Chinatown Chief of Police
Sullivan intends in a few days to with
draw the uniformed officers who have
been doing duty In .that quarter and as
sign the usual squad to hold the Mongol
ian gamblers in check. Since the with
drawal of Sergeant Brophy'and his men
from the Chinese quarter the Chief has
detailed a large number of uniformed
policemen to patrol the streets of China
town and prevent unlawful gambling.
Finding that the uniformed officers were
not a success in suppressing the games, the
head of the Police Department decided to
withdraw them and substitute a squad
composed of a sergeant of police and six
officers. Their duty will be to raid various
games prohibited by the Penal Code and
to arrest the keepers and players. .
Just who will compose the new squad is
not known except to the Chief, and he re
fuses to divulge their names. It is said,
however, that Sergeant McManus of the
Southern station is the choice of the Chief
for the head of the squad. McManus has
been in Chinatown before, and is looked
upon as one of the most honest men In
the Police Department. He is bitterly op
posed to again doing: duty in the Mongolian
quarter, and threatens to resign if he is
placed at the head of the new squad.
The greatest objection to uniformed of
ficers in Chinatown, according to the Chief,
is that the lookouts of the various games
have no trouble In locating the men when
they are about to make a raid, and they
Instantly give the alarm. The evidence is
promptly disposed of. and when the of
ficers enter they find the gamblers en
gaged in playing dominoes or some other
harmless game. "With the new squad
Sullivan confidently expects to at least
give the Mongolian gamblers a "run for
their money." * .' : -

Unconscious . of any danger and scare*
realizing the meaning: of the word fire,
little Grace Marllle Sims, the eighteen
month-old daughter of Mr.' and Mrs. Peter
Sims, living at 36Â»Â£ Gilbert street, walked
through the flames that had been kindled
by her five-year-old sister in the rear of
the house yesterday and was fatally
burned 2>efore aid could come.
Just a few moments before the cruel
tragedy the mother of the children ha<*
gone to the front door to answer the rln, fi
of a peddler, leaving the little ones aloro
at their play In the yard. When Mrs.
Sims returned, in answer to the piercing
screams that came to her ears, she beheld
Miss Clara Koschnick; a neighbor, in the
act of ' stripping the burning garment*
from the body of the little one. The suf
ferer was removed to the Emergency Hos
pital and Dr. Malaby did everything In
his power to alleviate her sufferings, but
death came soon after 5 o'clock. Tua
accident occurred at noon.
So badly was the child burned that
every portion of the body, save the feet,
which had been protected by the shoe^,
was seared and roasted beyond any sem
blance of human flesh. The parents of the
little tot are heart broken from, the'r
loss.
