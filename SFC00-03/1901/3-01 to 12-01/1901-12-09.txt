BUTTE. Mont., Dec. 8.â A new cave
that gives promise of developing into the
most wonderful of its kind in the known
world has been discovered in the moun
tains forty-eight miles east of Butte, in
Jefferson Canyon.- Its extent is as yet
unknown, though it has been explored for
a distance of ten miles and to a depth of
about 800 feet. $
The entrance to the cave, which is near
the track of the Northern Pacific Rail
way and about 1600 feet above the bed of
the river, was discovered a few weeks
ago by a hunter, and 'the cave has just
been explored by a party headed by J. W.
Gilbert, a newspaper writer of Butte. Gil
bert returned to-day after an absence of
a week with evidence of his discoveries.
Several skeletons were found in one of
the many rooms, and many articles and
utensils of. stone and copper were lying
about. Some of these have been brought
out. ' The skeletons are of 'persons of gi
gantic* stature, and the belief of Gilbert
is that the cave was the abode of a pre
historic people and that further explora
tion will bring to light proof of this fact.
A theory is that by a sudden change and
disturbance of the earth the entrance to
the ancient home was closed and the in
habitants walled up and left to die.
A large river, with a fall of 100 feet at
one place, is one of the wonders of the
cave, and a score of apartments, some
hundreds cf feet in extent, are decorated
with the wondrous formations of nature.
One room resembles the interior of a
cathedral, with a gigantic pipe organ, the
pipes being formed of stalactites, tuned
by nature to give forth beautiful notes of
harmony. A member of the exploring par
ty by striking the pipes with a stick
played a rude imitation of "Nearer, My
God. to Thee."
Access to the cave is very difficult, Ws
a direct descent of 400 feet is necessary
before any footing can be obtained. An
other party will soon visit the place fully
equipped for a thorough investigation.

CALL BUREAU. 1*)6 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON. Dec. 8.â Senator
Frye of Maine and Representative Gros
venor of Ohio will introduce in the Senate
and House to-morrow the ship subsidy
bill, which has at last been completed.
"I have spent much time and thought on
this measure," said Senator Frye to-night
to The Call correspondent, "and It is very
largely my own creation. I think all the
objections made to former shipping bills
are met and I hope it will pass. I expect
it will receive the almost unanimous sup
port of the Republicans of the Senate. In
the House I have strong hopes of enough
votes to enact the measure into law."
The first section of the bill takes the
postal subsidy law of 1801 as a basis and
restores the rates practically to what they
were in the bill as it originally passed the
Senate. It increases the tonnage required
in that law and makes the class of each
knot above fourteen up to twenty.
The bill next provides that all American
ships engaged in, foreign trade shall re
ceive one cent a ton for every 100 miles
sailed. All provisions of the postal sub
sidy act relating to the employment of
sailors, apprentices and Government in
spectors on vessels having contracts to
carry United States mails are in the new
measure. Vessels receiving Government
subsidies according to the provisions of
the act shall be built in a manner satis
factory to the Secretary of the Navy and
must be capable of being used for pur
poses of national defense in times of war.
No Premium on Speed.
All speed premiums are omitted In the
present bill. The provisions for extended
contracts in the subsidy bill defeated in
the last session are also eliminated.
The repeal of or amendment of the law
rests absolutely with Congress. No for
eign built ships are admitted to American
register. The provisions of the former bill
relating to fisheries are renewed.
The bill, which passed the Senate in
1S91. providing for postal subsidies, was
amended in the House by cutting down
rates. As amended the bill became a law
and proved an utter failure. Senator Frye
now believes that if a bill containing
higher rates, as put in by the Senate ten
years ago, should be passed it would be
a success. Senator Frye- believes the
measure he has prepared will establish
regular American lines of ocean traffic.
"Certainly," he said, "we shall have
new lines of American ships from the Pa
cific Coast to China and on the Atlantic
we shall soon have new American lines
running to the south, where we have a
right to look for the greatest extension ot
our foreign trade.
"The provision for 1 cent per '.on for
every 100 miles sailed is put in on the
theory that it will equalize conditions be
tween American freight carrier' and those
of Great Britain.
Will Boom Shipbuilding.
"There is absolutely nothing in the bill
that is favorable to any of the big trans-
Atlantic lines and there is nothing what
ever to encourage a combination In so
called trust form of any large shipping
corporations. The ship-bu*lding industries
all along our coast3 will get renewed life
and stimulation by the Increased demands
for American vessels."
Senator Hanna has seen the provision*
of the new bill and has given them his
cordial approval. He says he shall make
a speech In support of. the measure and is
advising his friends to work and vote for
it. He declares he sees nothing in tha
Frye bill to which any friend of Amer
ican commerce and shipping could object.

ARCHBISHOP RIORDAN conse
crated and anointed yesterday
afternoon 117 children kneeling
before the altar of St. Joseph's
Church. The impressive con
firmation services were directed by the
Archbishop, who was assisted by Father
Scanlan, the priest of the parish, Father
Keane, Father Collins, Father Hartnett
and Father Sullivan.
The friends and relatives of the young
conflrmants crowded the church to the
walls. When the sacrament was received
there was not an unoccupied seat. Along
one side of the central aisle were rows of
girls all dressed in white, and opposite
them were the boys, in bl&ck.
After the confirmation ceremony Arch-
bishop Riordan addressed the congrega
tion. In part he said:
Children, look forward to your confirmation
promises and see that they take root in your
hearts. These promises if fulfilled will de
velop into Christian virtues and you will all
be the purer and the better for It.
I want to remind the parents of these chil
dren confirmed here to-day of the necessity
cf parish religious teaching. A man that has
no care of the- household is worse than an
infidel. These children belong to the great
household of the faith. If you neglect your
duty you will be held answerable. To-day the
little ones have received the holiest of sac
raments. The holy spirit of God renews Its
presence in their souls and will lead then:
from virtue to virtue. It is a great grace
given to us by the almighty God. . Let us pray
that these children may never swerve from
the paths of virtue and righteousness.
From the boys, who were read into the
League of the Cross, the Archbishop ob
tained a willing pledge of adherence to
the cardinal principles of the order.

At the Conclusion of the triduum at St,
ARCHBISHOP RIORDAN CONSE
CRATING THE CHILDREN OF
ST. JOSEPH'S CHURCH.
Francis' Church yesterday afternoon
there was a reception of aspirants, and
postulants into the sodality of the Chil
dren of Mary. Rev. T. Caraher, the pas
tor, officiated. Music was rendered by
the choir under the direction of the or
ganist, Mrs. Collins, and the responses
and hymns were sung by the â  young
ladies.
Father Caraher, in speaking of the ob
ligations they assumed, said in part:
Maids of honor to Queens and Empresses
deem it a great privilege to be members of a
royal household in order to minister to these
great personages. How much greater, there
fore, is the privilege of belonging to the house
hold of the Queen of Heaven. As these privi
leges are great, so much greater are your du
ties and obligations. The practice of attending
theaters on Sundays and being present at many
plays that are presented to the public must
be stopped. Reading in the daily papers I find
that there is a play now being presented to
the public in which both the play and the
principal players are denounced as unfit to be
seen upon the stage.
I want to warn you against frequenting the
ballroom, as it is the harvest field of Satan.
I want to denounce in as forcible terms as I
can the balls which are given every Saturday
and Sunday night in a hall within a stone's
throw of this church. There ia too much danc
ing and waltzing among Catholics. The church
has never sanctioned such an amusement, and
the church or the religious institution that
lives on the proceeds of the waltz should be
allowed to perish. The children of Mary should
practice humility, obedience, charity and chas
tity, particularly the latter two.
Miss Florence Scage, president;* Miss
Katie Van Elsinger, secretary, and Miss
Mary Dowling. treasurer, are the princi
pal officers of the society, and had charge
of the candidates. In the evening - Rev.
Father Oneslmus, O. F. M., preached
the sermon, dwelling upon the dogma of
the Immaculate Conception.
CEREMONIES AT ST. IGNATIUS.
Sodalities Celebrate Feast Day With
Marked Devotions.
One of the most important feasts of
the Catholic church â that of the "Im
maculate Conception of the Blessed Vir
gin â was celebrated yesterday with
elaborate ceremonies. In every church
solemn high masses and vespers were
celebrated and sung, while organs pealed
forth Joyous paens and choirs sang an
thems of praise. At St. Mary's Cathedral
Archbishop Riordan officiated, preached
the sermon and gave the pontifical bless
ing at the close. At St. Ignatius Church
the day was given up to a reunion of
the sodalities placed under the protec
tion of the Blessed Virgin, while in other
churches ceremonies perhaps less "elab
orate but just as significant marked the
day.
Early in the morning the members of
the Gentlemen's Sodality attached to St.
Ignatius Church to the number of 500 as
sembled in their hall and formed in pro
cecsion. They were headed by their ven
erable prefect, James R. Kelly, and were
under the direction of Father Hickey, S.
J. They carried their banners, which
are only used on the most solemn occa
sions. Each member wore his regalia,
and as soon as the line was formed they
proceeded in a body to the church, oc
cupying the center aisles. Each mem
ber received holy communion. In. the
evening, when they attended the solemn
high vespers, the procession was re
peated.
After the mass the members of the Stu
dents' Sodality, under the direction of
the Rev. Father Culligan, S. J., ap
proached the holy table and a large num
ber of them received their first com
munion.
At the solemn high mass, which was
celebrated at 10:30 o'clock. Rev. Edward
Allen, S. . J., was the celebrant; Rev.
Father Forhan, S. J., deacon, and Rev.
Mr. Fleuren, S. J., sub-deacon. The ser
mon was preached by F.ev. B. J. But
ler, S. J., who took his text from the
gradual of the mass, "Happy Art Thou
O Sacred Virgin Mary, and Most "Worthy
of. All Praise." He said In part:
When our first parents transgressed God's
precepts by eating the forbidden fruit, their
open violation of God's commands brought-in
finite ruin of all mankind. Together with the
loss of grace, they lost countless other bless
ings and were doomed to Innumerable hard
ships, sufferings and death. But infinite wis
dom ordained that one. a chosen virgin, be ex
empt from the common. calamity;. for he had
destined her to be the mother of the second
Adam, Jesus Christ, who was to repair the
ruin wrought by the first.
â  It shall be our aim to-day to see how becom
ing it was that the three persons of tile heav
enly trinity should preserve the Blessed Virgin
Mary free from the slightest stain of original
sin. It. was fitting for the father to do so,
for she was to be his daughter; for the son,
for she was to be his mother, and for the holy
spirit, for she was to be his spouse. And first
of all, it was fitting to the eternal father to
create Mary free from the original stains. She
was his first born daughter, as the church says
in the mass of to-day: "I came out of the
mouth of the most high, the. first born of all
creation." Hence it is not meet that she should
be the slave of Lucifer, but that she should
always be possessed by God alone. "The Lord
possessed me in the beginning of his ways."
She was the one and only daughter of life;
all the others being born in sin are daughters
of death.
It was also fitting that the eternal father
should create her in his grace, since he deter
mined that she should save a lost world and
reconcile man with his maker. She was born
to procure the world's salvation. St. Bernard
compares her to the ark of I$oah, for as by the
ark men were saved from the deluge so by
Mary we are saved from the shipwreck of sin.
But the ark is a mere faulty shadow of Mary,
for in it but a few were saved, but through
Mary the whole human race has been redeem
ed. And so we call her the new â  Eve, the
mother of life, for the first was the mother of
death, but the Virgin Mary Is the mother ot
life.
In celebration of the day the Ladies'
Sodality met in the afternoon and re
ceived a number of candidates. Rev.
Father Calzea, S. J., presided at the
ceremonies.
In the evening solemn high vespers
were sung. Father Butler. S. J., was
the celebrant, assisted by Rev. Mr.
Villa, S. J.. as deacon and Rev. Mr.
Fleuren, S. J., as sub-deacon. Very Rev.
J. P. Frieden, S. J., officiated at the
benediction -which followed, assisted by
Rev. Father Hickey, S. J., as deacon,
and Rev. Mr. Ryan, S. J., as sub-dea

OIL GUSHES
MEAR SAN JOSE
Great Strike Is Reported
in Santa; Ciara
County.
Powerful Gases Drive Work
men From the Flowing
Well.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN" JOSE, Dec. 8.â An important oil
strike has teen made near this city
and within the next twenty-four hours
Santa Clara County will be in the throes
of a big oil excitement. A flow of from
400 to 500 barrels in twenty-four hours is
reported by the oflicers of ihe Orchard
Crude . Oil Company in a well they are
now sinking on tne Main ranch about
seven miles west of this city. '
A few weeks ago the company secured
a lease of the Main ranch ma started bor
ing for oil. Some years ago oil had been
struck in a well, but ihe project was sub
sequently abandoned. Two weeks ago the
present company went through a strata of
oil sand at forty and eighty feet and a
small quantity of oil was struck, iiince
then more oil has been found, but the
company has kept it quiet and gone about
securing leases to land in the vicinity.
Last Monday H. W. Conkling, the presi
dent of the company, filed twenty leases
to land in that locality. Oover 1000 acres
have thus been bonded. To-day tne true
size ol the oil strike was made public. T.
A. Pieper, the superintendent of the
company, stated that a great deal of oil
has been found and he is positive the well
will produce from 4C0 to SÂ» barrels in a
day. Yesterday afternoon the men had
reached a depth of 800 feet and struck a
strata of oil-bearing sand. Into this they
have gone about thirty-five feet and the
gas came up so strong as to force the
workmen from the well. Oil began to flow
and in order to prevent this water was
run into the well. The oil-bearing sand
will now be gone through and the casing
pierced. The oil is of an asphalt base.

High Prices for Army Mounts Causa
Wholesale Stealing in the
Northwest.
TACOMA. Dec. 8.â Dispatches from Col
fax and Pendleton say that wholesale
horse-stealing is going on in the interior
country south of Pendleton. The high
price placed upon the semi-wild animals,
because of great demands for cavalry
horses for South Africa, has encouraged
men to carry off the mounts. The ma
rauders have not been apprehended, but a
posse of deputy sheriffs is pursuing them.
It is supposed the organized gang, which
has been carrying on extensive cattle
rustling operations for several years in
Central Oregon, is at work now on the
range horses. This band makes quick
forced marches, rounds up eighty to one
hundred animals and runs them out of
the country almost before the loss is dis
covered. The horses are then loaded at
some convenient railroad point and
shipped to where the Government buyers
are located.

JURORS FASTEN
CRIME ON BIRR
Find Denver Merchant
Guilty of Diamond
Robbery.
DENVER, Dec. 8.â The jury in the case
of.J. K. Barr, formerly a prominent mer
chant and manufacturer of Denver, on
trial charged -with robbing Mrs. Mary
Betts of $7000 worth of diamonds, to-night
returned a verdict of guilty after being
out twenty-two hours. The penalty for
the crime Is from one to fourteen years in
the penitentiary.
Something' over a year ago Mrs. Betts
was robbed of her diamonds while return
ing to the city from a drive with a man
by the name of Haennalt. The latter was
also robbed of a sum of money, but was
later arrested, charged with having en
tered into a scheme to rob Mrs. Betts, the
drive, it was charged, being part of an
alleged conspiracy. Haennalt was con
nned in prison for some months, and dur
ing the time implicated Barr in the case.
The charges against him were dropped
upon his agreement to turn State's evi
dence. This he did not do, however. One
of the sensational features of the case
was the testimony of Mrs. Betts that she
was of the opinion that the person who
took her jewels from her was a woman
disguised in man's clothing. Barr's at
torneys will move for a new trial to-mor
row.

Great Meeting in Chicago, Addressed by Bourke Cockran,
Adopts Resolutions Calling Upon the President to Use
His Good Offices to End the Struggle in .South Africa
CHICAGO, Dec. 8.â A programme of
protest against British methods in the
South African war was carried out before
an immense audience in the Auditorium
Theater here to-night. Following an elo
quent address by W. Burke Cockran and
earnest speeches by others, resolutions for
the appointment of a committee to bring
the sentiment of the meeting before the
President were adopted. '
Although an admission was charged, the
funds being intended to aid the Boers,
and especially their women and children,
standing room was at a premium and
many were unable to gain admittance.
The programme opened with the song
"The True Heart," by nineteen German
singing societies of Chicago. Dr. Hiram
Thomas, head of the People's Church, fol
-iowed with a prayer for the women and
in South African prison camps.
Then followed short addresses by Judge
Theodore Brentano and Judge Mtirray
Tuley, chairman of the Chicago branch of
the American Transvaal League, under
the auspices of which the meeting was
held.

when Mr. Cockran, the orator of the even
ing, arose and bowed in recognition of the
tumult of applause which greeted him. He
said, in part: Â«
However men may differ about the invasion
of the South African republics, all are agreed
that the restoration of peace Is In the highest
degree desirable. There are but two ways in
which the war can be terminatedâ either the
Boers must surrender or the English must
abandon the hope of subduing them.
But is It true that the resistance of the
Boers Is hopeless? Since the fall of Pretoria
it certainly has not been fruitless; It has been
justified by most important results. Lord
Salisbury's position that nothing but absolute
surrender would be considered has been aban
doned, and to-day the burghers could obtain
almost any terms short of complete acknowl
edgement of their independence. As their re
sistance has not been fruitless, neither is their
struggles for independence hopeless. On the
contrary. If their resistance is prolonged for a
few months, the abandonment of the- struggle
to subdue them by Great Britain is Inevitable.
This statement is not toased on any special
information concerning the war, but on the
conviction that it will be impossible for the
Government to secure the passage of many
more war appropriations through the House oÂ£
Commons. The last budget was passed only
after immense difficulties. All sources of
taxation have been exhausted and the attempt
to effect another large war loan would result

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; MONDAY, DECEMBER 9 1901.
INDIGENT INVALID FALLS HEIR
TO A QUARTER OF A MILLION
DENVER, Dec. 8.â With only $2.75 in his pocket and a sick wife at home, Louis Grevin, an invalid here*
for his health, received a telegram yesterday from a firm of Kansas City, Mo., lawyers, announcing that
he was heir to a fourth interest in the Soison farm, in the department of Lang,. near Paris.
The farm is worth $1,000,000. It is one of the famous stock farms of the world. Kirk Armour
and Robert Bonner have bought horses there. Maurice Bigot conducted it from the day he was 21
years old until his recent death at the age of 79- On this farm Rosa Bonheur found models for many of her pic
tures, notably that of "The Horse Fair." The great ' Norman stallions she depicted were those for which Soison
farm is famous. .
There are four heirsâ Grevin, his mother, who lives in Chicago, Pierre Parks of Ithaca, N..Y., and Fran
cois Grevin of Paris. ; .'.,.â 
Louis Grevin has been a "capper" for the Cottage Club gambling-house here, as he was too ill to do heavy
work. He came to Denver from Kansas City a little more than a year ago. He was a cigar clerk in the Vic
toria Hotel there. His own and his wife's illness drove him to sore straits, but he was too proud to ask for
money from his rich grandfather and wrote that he was quite well to do when asked if he needed money. Three
years ago Grevin visited the Soison farm. ' His grandfather urged him to stay and offered him a share in the
management of it, though he was then only about 23 years old. Grevin will, however, live in Denver*
in such a fall in the price of consols as would
seriously Jeopardize British industries. If,
then, the Boer forces can hold the field a little
longer, the attempt to subdue the republics
must be abandoned for lack of means to' pur
sue it.
The capacity of the Boers to maintain the
struggle is placed beyond a doubt by the bar
barity of the methods employed to subdue
them. The Knglish Government cannot avoid
supporting the women and children made home
less by the destruction of the farms. With
the support of his women and children im
posed upon England, while his lands have
been â¢ made desolate and unproductive, the
Boer soldier is free to continue in the field
as long as he can secure by capture abundant
supplies of food and arms from the English
forces. His reputation for humanity and cour
age make the English soldier prefer surren
dering to facing his rifle.
Real Interests of England.
Nothing can be clearer than that the resist
ance of the burghers cannot be* suppresseci.
and, therefore, the only possible way to peace
Is the withdrawal of Great Britain from the
attempt to subdue the South African soldiers.
The British Government' may prolong the war.
but cannot change the outcome. Such a re
sult being consistent with justice, it is In
the interests of every one to hasten it. The
real interests of 'England as well as of the
rest of the world will be advanced by pro
moting It.
The pretense that the existence of these re
publics endangered British authority over the
rest of South Africa is unworthy serious con
sideration. If republics and monarchical au
thority are so hostile that their mere proximity
Involves conflict between them, this country
would be justified In annexing Canada as a
necessary measure of protection for its own
.safety.
This meeting has no disposition to provoke
bitterness, or to increase the crop of resent
ments, already too large, throughout the
world. Much as we might desire the Incor
poration of Canada 'In the Union, unless it
could be accomplished by the consent of- the
people on both sides of the frontier, we do not
wish it. but it may be well to point out that
there was much less justification for the as
sault upon the South African republics by
Great Britain than there would be ! for the
forcible annexation of Canada by this country.
Continuing, Mr. Cockran said that the
real interest of the Irish people in the
Transvaal war was in extending the do
main of English commerce, not in extend
ing the domain of the English crown. He
continued:
Disaster to the English people lies not In the
defeat of this enterprise, but In its success. If
the South African republics were subdued and
the last Boer disarmed, the men and women
now in captivity must be returned to the soil.
To maintain authority over these peopleâre
sentful, dissatisfied, accustomed to bearing
armsâ would require the maintenance of a
huge army and such an army could not be
maintained without establishing compulsory
military service in Great Britain. The es
tablishment of compulsory military service in
j England would be the ruin of the British con
stitution. The name of England might remain
to distinguish a political division of the earth's
surface, but not to describe a country of con
stitutional freedom.
Appeals to Roosevelt.
The conquest of the Transvaal, while It might
be dangerous to the burghers, would be fatal
to England. The people who have the great
est interest of all In the defeat of English
arms are the people of England. They can be
saved from this peril. Civilization can be de
livered from this cloud which darkens Its hor
izon If the conscience of the English people
can be awakened. To do this, the most effective
means is to show them that the people of this
country do not sympathize with the scheme of
conquest which the English Government has
undertaken.
Providence has so ordered events that the
President of the United States can quell this
bitter war. It is an extraordinary opportunity
offered to an extraordinary man. It would not
be necessary to draw the sword, to make any
threat of armed intervention, or to take an un
friendly attitude. One word spoken to the
Knglish embassador or In the hearing of the
English nation would restore peace, establish
justice secure liberty to these burghers and
promote enormously the friendly relations be
tween the people. . *"
Will that word be spoken? Never In history
have such momentous results hung on the lips
of a human being. Will Theodore Roosevelt
improve thiB opportunity for himself, his coun
try and the whole human race?
A letter from Carl Schurz was read, in
which he said:
I am one of those who heartily rejoice at the
subsidence in this country of the old and more
or less unreasoning prejudice against England.
I witness with sincere satisfaction the dis
appearance from our popular oratory of the
cheap trick of "twisting the British lion's
tail," and I hail with joy the growth of a
real friendship between the two nations. But
Englishmen should not Indulge In any delusions
about this. Deep In their hearts the great
masses of the American people cherish a pro
found sympathy for the Boers In their struggles
and sufferings. What they condemned was
done by the British irf South Africa. And if
there is anything apparent to revive the old

NATIVE SCOUTS
KILL DESERTER
Bring/Into Camp the
Head of David
Fagin.
MANILA, Dec. 8.â Native, scouts from
Bangabon, province of Nueva Ecija, have
killed the American negro, David Fagin,
a deserter from the Twenty T fourth In
fantry (colored), who for more than two
years has been leading Filipinos against
the American troops. The native scouts
decapitated their prisoner. The man's
head, however, was recognized as that of
Fagin. The scouts also secured his com
mission in the insurgent army. Fagin
had on one of his fingers the class ring
of Lieutenant FredericK W. Alstaetter of
the engineers, who -was captured by Fili
pinos, supposedly under the command of
Fagin himself, on October' 28, 1900. : Fagin
has been reported killed on several occa
sions. The authorities are satisfied that
former statements of his death were er
roneous and that he has now been killed.
A military committee has sentenced
Filipino General lsidor Torres to be hang
ed, after finding him guilty of ordering
the assassination of Corporal Fieldner of
the 'iweitth infantry at Malolos, province
of Bulucan, last October. Tne sentence
of ine commission nas been disapproved
by Ueneral cnattee, who Unas mat tno
commission has reasonable grounds to
doubt wnether General Torrea personally
ordered the assassination of the Ameri
can soldier. General Chaffee believes
that the nigh ranK occupied by Torres in
the insurgent army would have been suf
ficient to prevent such unmilltary action
on his j>art.
The case of Patterson, the Englishman,
private secretary to Sixto Lopez, to de
port whom from Manila eltorts were
made after he had landed there without
swearing allegiance to the United States,
is still nanglng fire before the Supreme
Court. Patterson's attorneys assert that
their client, once having landed, is be
yond the jurisdiction of W. Morgan
Shuster, Collector of Customs for the
Philipnines, who has been trying to ef
fect Patterson's expulsion.
The United States Philippine Commis
sion has passed; an act authorizing the in
sular purchasing agent to draw money
In gold for payment for supplies pur
chased, as the merchants refuse to sell
goods for Mexican silver.
. A general feeling of uneasiness pre
vails among the business men of Manila
over the unofficial announcement that,
beginning on January 1, the United State3
Philippine Commission intends to reduce
by the difference of the fall in the price
of silver the present ratio of two Mexican
dollars for one gold dollar. It is hoped,
however, that some solution of the diffi
culty may be found which may obviate
this necessity, as, for instance, the tax
ing of each silver dollar imported into
the islands by the difference between its
actual bullion price and 50 cents in gold,
until such time as the United States Con
gress gives authority for the issuance of
a Philippine currency.
LARGE AMOUNT OF COIN
TURNED OUT BY THE MINTS
Considerable Number of Gold Pieces
Coined at Philadelphia for
Costa Rican Government. |
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.â The report of
George E. Roberts, Director of the Mint,
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1901,
has been completed. The coinage of the
mints during the fiscal year amounted to
176,999,132 pieces of the value of $136,340,781.
Of this $69,065,715 was in' gold, $24,298,850
was in silver dollars. $10,966,648 was in
fractional silver and $2,009,568 was in
minor coins. There also were coined at
the Philadelphia Mint 225.000 gold pieces
of the value of $349,014 for the Government
of Costa Rica.
Coinage operations were conducted dur
ing the year in the mints at Philadelphia,
San Francisco and New Orleans. The
Philadelphia Mint is now in its new quar
ters, and the old site, including the struct
ure, will be offered for sale to the high
est bidder on December 19, 1901.
The new Mint under construction at
Denver has made slow progress during
the year, and the supervising architect
finds an additional appropriation neces
sary before the fall contracts can be let.
The appropriation* for site and building
was $500,000 and for equipment $150,000.
The new mints at Philadelphia and Den
ver, together with the old ones at San
Francisco and New Orleans, will afford
ample facilities for this country for many
years to come.
anti-British feeling in this republic, it is the
terrible spectacle presented by the Boer war.
The following resolutions were adopted:
Resolved, That we,' as American citizens, be
lieve that the wanton destruction of property
of non-combatants by English military authori
ties in South Africa (without precedent in
modem times, save by English officers in the
war of the American revolution) is a source
of needless suffering to the people of the
South African republics and without advantage
to the operations of the English army; "and
the slaughter of helpless and innocent, caused
by English prlspn pens. Is a useless outrage on
the humanity of the civilized world, which
amply Justifies concentrated remonstrance by
American and European states; and, believing
that the rights and obligations of common
humanity are not determined by geographical
or political limitations; and regarding tht
treaty of 1871 as made to be observed by Eng
land as well as by America, we do most sol
emnly remonstrate and protest against the acts
of. the English Government.
Resolved. That we, and each of us, do here
by pledge ourselves to use our utmost powers
to make this, our purpose, known to our sev
eral Representatives In the American Con
gress, and to cause a copy of these resolutions
to be brought to the attention of the President
of the United States with our most respectful
but urgent petition that the treaty of Wash
ington of May 8, 1871. be strictly , enforced and
that the use of American ports and watero
be henceforth denied to vessels operated under
British charter for the augmentation of sup
plies of war; and that the President of the
United States will employ every possible
means to bring to an end the horrors of con
centration camps and a war which by its un
exampled ferocity and enormous cost of life
and treasure has astounded the civilized world.
Resolved, That the chairman be authorized
to appoint a committee of citizens of Chicago
to call the attention of the President to these
resolutions and the sentiment of the. citizens
of Chicago, and that such committee shall have
power to add .to its number citizens of other
portions of the United States. >,
A resolution was also adopted commend
ing Governor Yates of Illinois for issuing
a proclamation calling for assistance for
the occupants of concentration camps in
South Africa. .
The meeting closed with a remarkable
demonstration.' Following the speech
making the audience roared its approval
of the Boer cause, the cheering being long
continued, and then contributions â  were
asked for the relief of the stricken women
and children in South Africa, afore than
$5500 was raised. * /â â '
MINISTER SHOT TO DEATH
BY JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
Becomes Angered Because of Per
' sonal Remarks Made by Clergy
man From the Pulpit.
BROOKSIDE. Ala., Dec. 8â Rev. J. W.
Bradford, a Methodist minister at this
place, was shot by R. D. Coffman, Justice
of the Peace, to-day and died two hours
later.
Rev. Bradford had been returned here
as the Methodist minister for another
year. While at Sunday-school this morn
ing he called attention to the fact and
remarked that he hoped all the relations
between himself . and his congregation
would be pleasant. He added, it is alleged,
that their relations would be pleasant if
they would stop such men as Coffman
from lying about him and the church.
Coffman was once a member of the Rev.
Bradford's church, but had been expelled
on some charge.
After the shooting Coffman surrendered
and a warrant was sworn out charging
him with murder.

MORRISON NOT IN FAVOR
OF THE PANAMA ROUTE
Examination of the Canal Commission's Report Disproves
the Published Statement That One Member Would Ad
vise Against the Selection of the Nicaragua Survey
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL, BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
"W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.â An exam
ination of the report of the Isthmian
Canal Commission, which was sent to
Congress last week, shows that it is ab
solutely unanimous. There is no minority
report despite the assertion that Georfee
R. Morrison differed from his colleagues
to the extent of recommending the adop
tion of the Panama canal route. As it
reached Congress' the report Is unanimous
in its indorsement of the Nicaraguan
route as the "most feasible" one for an
inter-oceanic waterway.
This discovery is the more surprising
because the text of the so-called "minor
ity report," signed by Mr. Morrison, has
been published and accepted as a fact by
the press.
CANAL BILL TJP THIS WEEK-
Its Friends Expect Final Action Be
fore the Holidays.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.â The only meas
ure of Importance which the Senate haa
on its calendar for the present week is
the new Hay-Pauncefote treaty, making
provision for the abrogation of the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty and opening the way
for the unobstructed construction of the
isthmian canal by the United States. Act
ing for the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions, Senator Lodge will ask the Senate
to go into executive session to-morrow
for the consideration of the treaty, and
each day thereafter until the convention
is disposed of.
It can be said that at this time the
prospect is very strong that the treaty
will be ratified, and it now looks as if this
result would be obtained after compara
tively little delay. There will be some de
bate and some features of the document
will be qriticlzed as undesirable, but there
is no probability of captious opposition.
The criticism will be along the lines in
dicated by Senators Money and Bacon in
the Committee on Foreign Relations at
its meeting on Friday last. No Senator
thus far. however, has shown a disposi
tion to carry his objections to the point of
ultimate effort to defeat ratification. The
principal authors of the criticism of the
treaty are Southern Senators, who are
generally very anxious for the construc-
tlon of the canal. They find that all
canal legislation will be tied up until ac
tion can be obtained on the treaty, and
they are on this account less liable than
they otherwise would be to do anything
to delay action upon the treaty itself.
The most active friends of the treaty
now claim that ratification will be ob
tained during the present week, and the
opinion is very general that it will be won
at least before the Christmas holidays.
Beyond the consideration of the treaty
very little business will be undertaken be
fore the holidays. It Is now generally
agreed that the question of reciprocity
will go over until January, probably with
out so much as being mentioned, and it
may be added that from being for a time
the subject most likely to attract early
attention It has taken a position among
the matters which will not be vigorously
urged. When the reciprocity treaties do
come up for consideration there will bo
persistent opposition to the agreement
with France and to that with Great Brit
ain covering the West Indies. There is
not so much feeling over the conventions
with the South American republics.
The present outlook also is against any
immediate action in the Senate looking to
tariff legislation for the Philippines, ami
there are some indications that the Senate
will wait upon the House of Representa
tives in this matter. Probably the Chinese
exclusion action will be reported from the
committee during the week.
The nomination of Attorney General
Knox will be reported at the first session,
but immediate confirmation probably will
be antagonized by some Senators.
The House this week probably will pass
a measure to meet the situation created
by the Philippine decision of the Supreme
Court last Monday. Up to the present
time, however, the Republican members
of the Ways and Means Committee have
not decided Â«upon the character of tha
measure which will be reported. A differ
ence of opinion exists as to whether there
should be a temporary exactment of the
Dingley rates on goods entering tfce
United States from the Philippines or
whether a permanent scheme of tariff leg
islation for the islands should be pre
pared. It is understood that Payne.
chairman of the committee, and Dalzell
favor the latter course. The Republican
members of the committee will meet
again to-morrow. Of course, if it be de
cided to enact a temporary measure the
procedure will be exceedingly simple, and
it probably could be passed in a day.

THE BUSINESS OF THE COUNTRY.
WITH the possible exception of WaTPstreet,
where the tendency in prices has been
rather downward than upward of late, there
is no indication of any wane in the current prosperity.
Week after week passes with the same monotonous
chronicle of active markets and generally firm prices
for all classes of goods. If any line sags it soon re
covers buoyancy, provisions being a conspicuous
illustration of this inherent strength and ability to
readily recover lost ground. Bradstreet's has lately
been doing seme figuring on this cheerful condition,
and finds, by an exhaustive comparison, that "after
a slight breathing spell in October, prices, influenced
chiefly by the cereals, provisions and metals, appar
ently resumed their upward course in November, and
the index number on December i is 85,775, a gain
of seven-tenths of 1 per cent over the index number
of November 1 and of 3 per cent ovef the low-water
mark of June 1, but a decline of 8 per cent from the
high-water mark of February, 1900. In all, six out
of thirteen classes of products advanced during No
vember, they being breadstuffs, provisions, livestock,
the metals, coal and coke and miscellaneous products;
forty-five products advancing, twenty-three declining
and thirty-five remaining unchanged as a result of
operations during that month. Compared with a year
ago. fifty-one products are higher, forty-two lower
and thirteen remain unchanged."
According to this exhibit the general plane of busi
ness is distinctly higher than a year ago, which cer
tainly does not indicate any falling off.
At the same time, there is no marked gain at pres
ent The country's bank clearings, while larger than
those of last 3ear, still run low down in the scale of
increase, the percentage last week in favor of this year
being 9.9 per cent, whereas up to several weeks ago
it had for months been running as high as 50 and 75
per cent. Decreased activity in Wall street may ac
count for this falling off, as the daily operations in
that stock market do more to affect the nation's
clearings than any other line of business. The clear
ings of New York form over half of those for the
whole country. In other words, as far as actual com
mercial and financial payments go, New York City
does more trading every day than all the rest of the
United States combined. For instance, last week the
national metropolis did two-thirds of the business of
the country, her clearings amounting to $1,587,972,000.
those of the rest of the country to $890,179,500 and the
grand total of the country to $2,478,151,600. Xew
York is rather a busy place, according to these figures.
The staples continue in good condition for pro
ducers and sellers, all being active and the majority
firm. The woolen mills and shoe factories continue
to report a large output, which meets with ready sale,
and the iron and steel mills are sold away ahead into'
next year. Wheat and corn have been higher and
active at Chicago, and the buying of wheat .by farm
ers amounted for several days to a scramble to specu
late. The professional speculators met the farmers
and Wall street buyers more than half-way, ladled
them out all the wheat they wanted and pocketed their
profits with a complacent grin. The press dispatches
stated that for a day or two the countrymen and other
outsiders had the Chicago market in the hollow of
their hands, as the professionals had lost control of it
under the enormous buying demand. Still it will be
a great feat if the amateur plunger eventually gets
away with the professional, at Chicago or anywhere
else.
Our local markets show but little change. The
weather has been perfect from the farmer's and mer
chant's point of view, and the nipping frost at the
close 'of the week was exactly what was needed to
check the too rank growth of vegetation in orchards
and vineyards and impart strength to the growing
feed. Cheerfulness prevails everywhere, the demand
for merchandise is first rate, money is plentiful and
collections easy, and the State continues on the crest
of the wave of prosperity.
Eastern speculators and financiers now fear that
J. Pierpont Morgan has got Cramps. The trifling
difference between a capital letter and a small one
means the difference between a great' shipyard and
in internal disturbance in Mr. Morgan's physical
being. -
THE PLEA OF THE RAILROAD.
FROM the evening organ of the Southern Pa
cific Company there has come a plea for the
adoption of Assembly constitutional amend
ment No. 28. The plea is that the creation of the
commission proposed by the amendment would be
"an experiment worth trying." It is said: "True,
the proposed commission would be invested with ex
traordinary powers, but i^ cannot fail to be more
satisfactory than the present irresponsible system,
because its members will be elected and in time will
respond to popular demand for executive action.".
The plea is more ingenious than valid. It contains
a suppression of truth and a suggestion of false-'
hood. The present system of dealing with the issues
it is proposed to transfer to the extraordinary com
mission is not irresponsible. On the contrary, it is
far more directly responsible to public opinion than
the proposed commission would be. Moreover, the
members of the commission would not be elected for
many a year to come. The amendment provides that
the original members are to be appointed by the
Gbvernor. One of them is to hold office "for two
years, another for four, another for six, another for
eight and the fifth for ten years. It will therefore be
fully six years before a majority of the extraordinary
commission will be composed of members elected by
the people.
The railroad organ says: "Uniform action on the
subject of insurance, banking, water rates, gas rates
and equalization ought to be introduced into this
State by some process, and, if this is a good plan,
it is certainly worthy of trial." To that plea the re
ply is plain. The State has already provided for uni
formity with respect to banking, insurance and equal
ization by. commissions created for that purpose.
There is no desire for uniformity of water and of gas
rates, for the simple reason that demand and supply
of those articles depend upon local conditions, and
rates cannot be made uniform throughout the State.
At present they, are regulated by local authority, and
in the hands of such authorities they should remain.
It is hardly worth while to refute in detail a set of
pleadings which from first to last are founded upon
misstatements of the issue. The railroad organ does
not even define accurately the scope of the proposed
amendment, but presents it as a plan "designed to
.abolish a number of State and county boards and
commissions and to merge their duties into a single
board possessing all the powers previously exercised."
That is a very clever way indeed of putting the case.
As a matter of fact the amendment would subvert all
local authority in regulating even such matters of
purely local concern as water and gas rates, and
would create a commission having control of the re
lations to the public of all the great corporations of
the State. Moreover, it would vest the right to ap
point the original members of the commission in the
hands of the present Governor; that is to say, it
would give the corporations themselves the right to
dictate the membership of the commission and con
trol it absolutely for at least six years.
If there were no other objection to the extraordin
ary scheme the championship of the evening railroad
organ would in itself suggest an objection. The
railroad does not support the evening organ for
nothing. It is known that the Southern Pacific Com
pany subsidizes the Pest to the extent of over $3000
a month, and that it Is the mouthpiece of W. F. Her
rin. When Mr. Hays was president of the road he
desired to sell the organ as a bit of prop
erty useless to a company engaged in legiti
mate railroad business. However, it was not
sold. It remains subject to Herrin's orders
and works for the accomplishment of his
schemes. Consequently the fact that it indorses the
extraordinary commission is a sufficient warning to
the public that there is danger ahead. The extraor
dinary commission as appointed by Governor Gage
would be a Herrin commission for six years to come.
That in itself is a sufficient reason for defeating the
scheme.
President Roosevelt is reported to have stated posi
tively that if business permit he will come to Cali
fornia next spring. It happens, however, that this is
to be a long session of Congress, and consequently.,
the chances of the visit are slight. Still, here's hoping'
that business will behave itself and give the President
an opportunity to sec us when the poppies bloom.
CONTRACT LABOR.
THE advocates of equality of legislation as to
immigration, which will extend the principle
of Chinese exclusion to all the migrating na
tions and give the country more leisure to digest and
assimilate its immigrant population, will get an argu
ment out of the revelations of the Wabash road acci
dent in Michigan. One of the wrecked trains was
carrying a large number of immigrants from South
ern Italy, booked for San Francisco. The carnage
among them was horrible. Out of more than two
hundred but few survived the awful crush and con
flagration.
One of the wounded survivors, Giovanni Folorno,
was interrogated by Father Beccherini, an Italian
priest. Folorno said the party arrived in New York
on the steamer Campagne, and the whole band went
to a Mulberry-street banker to get their money
changed. These Mulberry-street bankers are
padrones and brokers, who contract the labor of
their countrymen, import them and shave their
money in exchange. He said the banker gave them
tickets to San Francisco. After examining the ticket
and certain other evidences the priest said: "But
how did this boy, under 18,'get out of Italy and into
this country? He has no passport. I think I know.
These men were being imported under contract to
work in San Francisco. Folorno could not tell me
how many were with him. When I asked him who got
him to come over here he looked suspicious, and I
could see he had been instructed to say nothing. He
only answered, 'A man had brought them over to
work.' He said he bad been given $25 by a Mul
berry-street banker.'.'
This is no doubt the revelation of a plot to vio
late our labor contract laws, and makes it probable
that such violation is going on at a wholesale rate.
It is no secret that most of the Southern European
labor that comes is transient. It has'learried from
the Chinese code of tactics, and stays here long
enough to acquire wealth upon which to return and
live easily in its own country. During its sojourn it
is probably naturalized and lends. aÂ« hand at Ameri
can politics, exercising a certain control over the
public affairs of a country for which it has only a
parasitic attachment.
It was to prevent this sort of importation and
transient sojourn that the law against contract labor,
was enacted. From Southern Europe we have re
ceived anarchist immigration and a variety of 'dis
orderly and undesirable elements, which â¢ do not
readily assimilate, and, while essentially foreign in
sentiment, under our naturalization laws can share in
the privileges of citizenship. There is some
strength in the argument that our whole- immigra-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALIi, MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1901.
tion policy- will stand a drastic revision. â¢ It- may be -
that in dealing with Chinese exclusion we have
learned something and have got our hand in' 1 , for
the job of a far more general protection of Ameri
can labor and our civil institutions than is to
be^ accomplished by the, exclusion of the people of
one Asiatic country alone. _ The labor and commer
cial depression that has set in in Germany may be
expected .to extend and soon to increase the chron
ically hard conditions of life in Southern Europe
generally. With good times in this country there
will be furnished the contrasting conditions that in
duce people to migrate. When .that immigration,
comes it is ready to work for wages down nearly to
the original Chinese level, and our domestic wage
rate suffers in consequence. The evil affects the
whole country and is not^ confined to this coast,
therefore it is a national affair, and the whole coun
try may well participate in devising a remedy that
will be for the relief of all sections.'
Colonel Meade of the Brooklyn navy-yard has!
been acquitted of the charge of "scandalous conduct
tending to the destruction of good morals," but as a"
part' of the evidence reported in the case was to" the"
effect that he once showed himself in public clad in
underclothes and a white helmet it is evident that if
his morals were good his manners .were eccentric. *
A POINT WORTH NOTING.
CONGRESSMAN METCALF'S appointment
to a position on the Committee of Ways and
Means of the House brings to the Republicans
of California a lesson, agreeable in its nature, which
will be well worth noting. It is a proof of the ad
vantage resulting from the re-election of capable men
to Congress instead of making a change of repre
sentatives merely for the sake of change. Had a new.
man been sent to Congress from Mr. Metcalf's dis
trict at the last election it is not at all likely that Cali
fornia would now have a representative on that im-.
portant committee of the House. â 
The Call has frequently had occasion to point out
that the weakness of California in Congress has been
due mainly to the practice of setting aside a repre
sentative after his first term and "giving^ another man,
a chance." No matter what were his abilities the new
man never had a chance at Washington equal to that
the former member would have possessed had he been
re-elected. It is difficult. for a new member to get a
place upon an important committee, and even if he
manage to do so his influence is slight by reason
of his lack of acquaintanceship with the members of
the House and the rules which govern Congressional
action.
Every business man knows that an employe who has
had experience is better than one who lacks it, no mat
ter how faithful the latter may be^ Success in any walk
of life is largely dependent upon personal friendships
and upon a knowledge of the men with whom one has
to deal. Friendships with influential men in Con
gress are not made in a day, nor is a knowledge of
.the ways of Congress learned by intuition and at first
sights
A man's first term in Congress is hardly more than
a term of apprenticeship. It is with his second term
that his real usefulness to his constituency begins.
The people of the older'States in the Union have long
since discovered that truth and they have been in
the main wise enough to profit by it. From some of
the older States the delegations are returned term
after term almost without change... 'The result is
those States have a power in the House far exceeding
their proportionate rank in the nation. They are
strong because their delegations are strong and know
how best to use their strength.
There is reason to believe the Republicans of Cali
fornia are beginning to realize the wisdom of re
electing their representatives. At present we have a
fairly strong position in the House, and it is steadily
improving with each term. If the constituencies will
continue to re-elect representatives who prove them
selves able, faithful and energetic, we shall soon have
a prestige in Congress second to that of no other
State in the Union.
THE, SOUTH AMERICAN TROUBLES,
WHEN Talleyrand drew from his study of
history the famous conclusion, "Revolutions
never go backward," he had no knowl
edge of what was going to happen in the his
tory of South America. In that country what they
are pleased to call "revolutions" go backward as easily
as forward. Moreover, they occasionally go side
ways. In fact, they seem to follow the* line of least
resistance and go whichever way the force of circum
stances directs.
At present we are having in the troubles of Vene
zuela and Colombia an illustration of a revolution
that oscillates. It goes forward a little way and then
it goes backward. The two republics are distinct, but
their, troubles are the same, but with a difference. In
Venezuela the Liberals are in power and the Con
servatives are, or were yesterday, in revolt. In Co
lombia the Conservatives are in power and the Lib
erals in revolt. For a time things were redhot, and
there was talk of war between the two Governments.
Just now^there is a subsidence. In each case the'
Government appears to have won. At least it con
tinues to hold office and, presumably, to collect
taxes.. Possibly there may be a change to-morrow.*
The issue between the two parties is not unworthy
of a good war, and it is a pity it cannot be fought
to^a finish. It is the aim of the Liberals to unite
Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia and thus form a
nation strong. enough to have "prestige in South
American politics, strong enough, in fact, to compete
with Brazil, Argentine or Chile. The Conservatives
desire to perpetuate the present situation, and that
means, of course, an endless conflict between petty
states, none of which can ever hope to count for much
in war, politics or commerce. The strength of state
patriotism is known to us, for we had an experience
of it in our Civil War, but we have learned that it is
worth while to set it aside in the interests of a. greater
patriotism. President Castro of Venezuela is wise
enough to understand that larger patriotism. He has
sought to bring about the union of the three repub
lic's, but jt seems he has failed. He has not dared
to go to; the assistance of the Colombian Liberals,
and as a consequence it appears they have been de
feated. The dream of a united republic ranking'
among, the greatest in South America, therefore, van
ishes for the present. However, it is sure to come
again. Revolutions in South America may at times
go backward, but it is always easy to renew them and
start them once more forward. Castro has at least
held his own against the revolt in Venezuela, and if
his party has failed in Colombia to-day it has the
satisfaction of knowing that to-morrow there will be
another day. -;.

MAGNATE. - MRS. CARNEGIE SHUNS NEWSPAPER NOTORIETY
AND HER PICTURE IS SELDOM SEEN IN PRINT.
MRS. ANDREW CARNEGIE has never courted newspaper publicity
and shudders, it Is said, at the mention of the word interviewer. The
world knows very little about her, therefore. This reluctance to appear In
any way conspicuous is apparent to every one who has made her ac
quaintance. She prefers to be regarded simply as the mistress of Skibo
Castle or 5 West Fifty-first street, New York, rather than a person of any pub
lic interest. >â¢ â¢ â â  â¢ .
, " An Englishman who visited Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie at Skibo, In Scotland,
last summer, said of Mrs. Carnegie: "I found her a charming, vivacious, clever
woman, and a model hostess who seemed studiously to avoid doing or saying any
thing that might appear to be in any way interesting to the outside world.
"A story is told illustrative of the devotion in which the 'iron master' holds .
his wife: A little' custom which Mrs. Carnegie adopts at her dinner parties is to
put into a small silk bag slips of paper bearing the names of all the ladles pres
ent. Then just before dinner Is announced she carries the bag around to all the
male guests and each 'dips' for his partner at table. One evening Mr. Carnegie
'drew' his wife. His boyish delight was immense. Holding the slip of paper so
that all the company could see the name inscribed thereon, he playfully invited
the men to make bids for it and the honor of 'taking Sown' Mrs. Carnegie. Pres
ently he grew serious. 'The offer is withdrawn,' he said. 'My luck Is too precious."
"Photography may be mentioned as one of Mrs. Carnegie's favorite pastimes.
The mistress of Skibo is about twenty years the Junior of her husband. There
is a daughter, a winsome little miss, in whose name Skibo Castle was purchased."

CRISIS OF 1893â R. W. C, City. There
was no monetary panic in 1833, but for
three months preceding June 30 there was
an unusual stringency in credits, a de
pression in prices and a remarkable series
of business failures. This was caused by
uncertainty on the tariff question and the
uncertainty of the .monetary policy of
the Cleveland administration.

THANKSGIVING DAY-P. S., City.
President Lincoln during tlie Civil War
issued proclamations recommending spe
cial thanksgiving for victory to the
Union forces in 18G2 and 1883, and a na
tional proclamation of the annual
Thanksgiving day in 1863 arid in 1864. The
President has since then annually issued
such a proclamation, and similar proc
lamations are issued by Governors of
States and Mayors of cities. Custom has
fixed, the last Thursday in November as
the day. Thanksgiving on the American
continent Is traced back to 1621, when the
first harvest was gathered at Plymouth

FIGHTING VALUE
OF THE WORLD'S
BATTLESHIPS
THE relative fighting " value of
the world's battleships is a sub
ject which naval experts find
very puzzling:, as there can be
no fixed rules to determine the
same. Various methods have been sug
gested, some very ingenious but lack
ing In simplicity. A very interesting table
of comparisons is made by the London
Engineer, which, as it places United
States battleships ahead of all others,
will commend itself to American read
ers. The gun units collectively are taken
of forty battleships in seven navies,
with the following results: United
Statesâ New Jersey Class. 116; British-
King: Edward, 104; Italyâ Beneditto Prin,
104; Franceâ Republlque, 94; Germanyâ
Wittelsbach. 88; Russiaâ Knarz Potem
sky Tavrtsetscky, 93; Japanâ Shlkishima,
82. Singularly enough, the Japanese bat
tleships Asahi, Hatsuse and ftllkasa are
not Included in the list, although they
are actually afloat and ready for service,
while many of the others exist only on
paper.
â 'â¢";>; ,>V-
The Japanese battleship Mlkasa, built
at Vlcker*s yard, Barrow, is ready for
departure. The keel was laid January 15,
1899, and the launch came off November
8, 1900. She is practically a sister ship to
the Asahi and Hatsuse, also built In
England in 1899, and iS|400 feet on the
water line, 432 feet over all, 7t> feet beam
and displaces 15,362 tons on a draught of
27 feet 2 Inches. The water-line protec
tion extends all around the vessel, dif
fering in this particular from the other
two ships, in which 80 feet from, the
stern is left unprotected. The main belt
is 9 inches thick for a distance of 15S
feet, tapering to S 1^ and to 5% inches and
4 inches at bow and stern. Above t5e
main belt and extending through the en
tire citadel of 156 feet the armor Is 6
Inches up to .the upper deck, and the
guns on the upper deck are in 6-inch
casements. The barbettes are 14 inches
to 10 inches In thickness, and the heavy
guns are protected by heavy shields. The
conning tower is 14 Inches thick; the ob-
Borvation tower, aft. is 3 inches. All the
armor la of Krupp nickel steel. The
armament consists of four 12-inch, ten
6-inch on the main deck, four 6-inch on
the upper deck, twenty 12-pounders,
eight 3-pounders and four 2%-pounders.
The total weight of metal discharged by
this armament In one minute Is 11%
tons, and the weight of one broadside
discharge in onto minute ia 7% tons. The
speed is calculated at 18 knots with 15,000
horsepower. The weight of the machin
ery 13 1356 tons. She has 25 Belleville
boilers, and the coal capacity is 1400
tons. The coat of this unrivaled vessel
is reported as being 9,843,466 yen for hull,
machinery and outfit and â¢ 4,414,663 yen
for armament, making a total of 14,260,
134 yen, or narly 57,130,000. The most ex
pensive ships in the United States navy
are the Oregon and Massachusetts, of
10,288 tons, reported to have cost $6,573,
032 76 and $6,047,117 95, respectively, with
the Wisconsin, of 11,523 tons, a close
third, estimated at $6,040,726 68. The six
battleships of the ,AVbemarle type, 14.000
tons and 19 knots speed, building for the
British navy, are estimated to cost
$5,400,000 each, and the two battleships
proposed for the United States navy of
16,000 tons and 13 knots will exceed
?7,0CO,00O.

The triple-screw cruiser Columbia, the
former commerce destroyer, which has
taken the place of the old Vermont as a
receiving ship at the Brooklyn . .navy
yard, is apparently not a happy : ' ship.
At one time last month no less than flf
ty-six men were under confinement on
the cob deck, some cells containing?
three or four. An incipient riot finally
broke out over the rough treatment or.
a prisoner, and in some unknown way
they secured some of the silver service
from the Columbia, which they broke
up and stuffed into the keyholes of their
cell3. Then with some bars, likewise
mysteriously obtained, they tried to
break out through the barred windows,
but none of them escaped. Considerable
damage was done while the riot lasted,
and court-martials with severe punish
ment are likely to follow.

Experiments with an invisibly steered
torpedo took place recently at Hughen
den, England, in the presence of naval
attaches of Germany, Austria and the
United States. It is called the
"actinauts," and is the invention of Or
iing Armstrong, a Swede. The torpedo
was manipulated at a distance of 1200
yards, and without wire3 the ruUder
moved to port or starboard, according to
the operator's will. The experiment was
entirely successful. "Actinauts" have al
ready run with success at Stockholm and
Portsmouth. An electric lamp enables
the operator to guide the torpedo at
night, while in the daytime a jet of wa
ter expelled by the "actlnaut" locates
its position.

Dock3 Nbs. 12 and 13 at the Portsmouth
dockyard are to be lengthened to ac

which are over 500 feet in length. The

Lieutenant Hepworth S. Alton, com
manding officer of the British destroyer
Thorn, has been court-martialed, severe
ly reprimanded and dismissed from his
ship as a result of his vessel running
down a boat and drowning three men.
A curious circumstance connected with
the trial was the fact that the Admiralty
direc^d that the accused be allowed to
give evidence on oath. It is a privilege
conceded to soldiers on trial, but hith
erto denied to sailors.
The recent failure of the steam trlal3
of the Jeanne d'Arc and Chateaurenault,
owing to defective â¢ boilers, has brought
out the fact that the French Ministry of
Marine has committed a stupendous blun
der. The ships referred to were fitted
with Guyot-Dutemple water-tube boilers,
a type which had been tried with indif
ferent success in some torpedo-boats, but
have since been discarded. Without as
certaining with some degree of certainty
that these boilers would answer as well
when 23,000 horsepower was developed as
when only about 4000 horsepower was re
quired, the naval authorities contracted
for 160,000 horsepower of the Guyot
putemple boilers, to be installed in seven
ships. The total failure of these boilers
in the Jeanne d'Arc and Chateaurenault
makes it necessary to lay the ships up
for repairs and reboilering, which will
take more than one year and add great
ly to the cost of these already very ex
pensive ships. The boilers ordered for
the other five ships will be a total loss
to the Government.

FALLS INTO WELL
AND IS DROWNED
Five-Year-Old Boy Meets
With a Fatal Ac
cident.
Loses His Life in the Pres
ence of Two of His
Brothera
While playing with several companions
In a. vegretable garden at- Sunnyside yes
terday afternoon Frank Deleantoni, aged
five years, who lived at Miguel and Joost
avenues, fell down a well and was
drowned. The unfortunate boy and his
two brothers left their home to visit the
sons of Antone Canapa, a vegetable gar
dener, at 247 liraugton avenue.
While playing in a field In the rear of
the house Frank fell in the well, which is
about thirty feet deep. The screams of
his companions attracted the attention of
Canapa and on hearing that the boy had
fallen Into the well he procured. a rope
and vainly endeavored to rescue him.
Failing to induce the child to catch hold
of the rope, Canapa lowered himself Into
the well, but too late to save the boy's
life.
When his lifeless body was brought to
the surface his mother seized it and re
fused to allow It to be taken from her.
"You can't take him from me," she
cried as she showered kisses on the cold,
damp face of her favorite offspring. "I
dare anybody to separate us."
After considerable parleying the grief
stricken parent was linally persuaded to
turn the body over to Canapa. Word was
at once sent to, the Coroner, and Deputy
Meehan was dispatched to take possession
of the body. When he reached the scene
he was firmly . told by the sorrowing
mother that under no circumstances
would she allow the remains of her child
to be taken to the _tor_ue.
"Touch it at your peril," tearfully ex
claimed the heart-broken woman, point-
Ing to the body of her child. "You will
have to. kill me before you can take my
darling from me."
Rather than add to her grief. Meehan
consented to allow the body to remain at
the house. An inquest will be held to-day.

SOFT, GLOSSY HAIB.
It Can Only Be Had Where There Is
No Dandruff.
Any man or woman who wants soft,
glossy hair must be. free of dandruff,
which causes falling hair. Since It has
become known that dandruff Is a germ
disease, the old hair preparations that
were mostly scalp irritants, have been
abandoned, and the public, barbers and
doctors included, have taken to using
Newbro's Herpicide, the only hair pre-
paration that kills the dandruff germ.
E. Dodd, Dickinson, N. D., says: "Herr
plclde not only cleanses the scalp from
dandruff and prevents the hair's falling
out, but promotes a new growth. Herpi-
cide keeps my hair very glossy."

regards as well demonstrated theoretical
ly, but had not been fully tested in prac
tice.
The report further says:
A eyEtem of merit and discipline has been
gradually developed ip the Weather Bureau,
which not only conforms to the letter of the
civil service law, but carries its spirit to a
logical conclusion. The system compels each
employe or official to work out his own official
salvation. It Is fair to all; it enables honest
and efficient persons to work themselves up
ward; It contributes to a high standard of
manly character and to efficiency In public
office, and it lÂ»lds back those of mediocre ati
tainments or of slothful habits.
An important extension of the forecast
work of the bureau was made during the
year, whereby meteorological reports
from certain- points in the British Isles,
the continent of Europe and from the
Azores are transmitted to Washington,
and, with observations from Nassau, Ber
muda and Turks Island, are regularly
published on the weather maps, together
with forecasts of the wind and the state
of the weather for the first three days
out of steamera bound eastward.
In a number of instances when storms
of marked strength were passing east
ward off the American coast forecasts of
the weather which probably would be ex
perienced by steamers leaving European
ports westward bound were cabled to
England. Fog predictions are also issued.
Reports from steamers show that these
forecasts and other special warnings have
been verified.
The climate . and crop service of tho
Weather Bureau has been improved. Tho
cotton region service has been extended
into Oklahoma and the Indian Territory,
and arrangements have been made for be
ginning a similar work in California, to
be known as the fruit and wheat service.
NAVAL MILITIAMEN
PISCUSS FOSS BILL
Decide to Indorse the Measure, After
Suggesting Several Modi
fications.
NEW YORK, Dec. 8.â The Association
of Naval Militias throughout the United
States has just concluded here a series
of meetings at which discussions wefo
held on the bill introduced in Congress
by Congressman Foss of Illinois, which,
provides for the organization of a na
tional naval reserve. Connecticut, Mary
land, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jer
sey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and
California were represented, California
by Lieutenant Commander White. The
meetings were presided over by Captain
Miller of New York.
Lieutenant Commander Southerland
presented the views of the Navy Depart
ment with regard to the question, and
after some discussion the Foss bill wap
indorsed, with several modifications.
These modifications are on lines suggested
by President Roosevelt in his message.
Another subject considered was the
question of taking steps toward obtain
ing the abolishment of .tho rank of "navnl
cadet" in the navy and the substitution
in its place of the rank of mldshlpmani
but nothing definite was decided upon. â

Federation Representa
tives Meet in Execu
tive Session.
SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 8.â Many dele
gates to the convention of the American
Federation of Labor, now in session in
this city, did not cease their activity de
spite the fact that this was Sunday. The
executive, council was in secret session
for several hours, but nothing was given
out for publication. , \
W. D. Mahon of Detroit, president of
the Amalgamated Association of Street
Railway Employes, waB in frequent con
ference with local labor leaders who are
directing the streetcar strike in this city.'
It is probable that Mahon and President
Mitchell of the mine workers will take
charge of the strike.
A delegation from the Allied Building
Trades of Philadelphia arrived here
during the day and held an interview
with Mahon on the street railway situa
tion in that city, where a strike is said to
be among the probabilities of the near fu
ture. The conferees desired a plan of con
ciliation by which nn attempt will be
made to bring together the Amalgamated
Association and the rival organization,
known as the Philadelphia Street Railway
Association.
The Metal Trades Federation held an
other meeting and discussed plans for
perfecting the organization. Nine of the
fifteen eligible metal trades unions in the
United States were represented.
. The American Federation of Labor con
vention will remain in session for th<j
next six days. Probably the most vital
question that will come before the con
vention is that of trade autonomy. The
brewery workmen and the mine workers*'
delegates probably will be the storm cen
ter on this question. Both of these trade
unions want Industrial autonomy, that is,
they advocate that all trades in one in
dustrial establishment should form one
organization for the better advancement
of the condition of all. They also, an
nounce that they will oppose trade auton
omy to the bitter end.
Nearly a dozen resolutions on the mat
ter of the exclusion of Chinese from tho
United States and island possessions are
In the hands of a special Committee. This
committee probably will report one reso
lution embodying all the- good points in
them. It will be also presented along with
one commending President Roosevelt for
advocating in his annual message the
continued exclusion of Chinese.
There has been no development in the
Gompers-Mitcbell Shaffer controversy,
which grew out of the strike. Diligent in
quiry failed to confirm the rumor that the
matter will be threshed out on the floor
of the convention. The principals of the
affair maintain an absolute silence.
At this time it seems reasonably certain
that all the present officers of the federa
tion will be re-elected.
Among the cities that have entered the
campaign for the next place of meeting
are Los Angeles and San Francisco. Port

SAYS MESSAGE
IS GREAT ONE
President Roosevelt's Ut
terances Are Highly
Commended.
Strong Sermon on Subject of
State Paper by Rev.
Dr. Coombe.
Patriotic services were held in the Rich
mond Congregational Church yesterday
morning. Rev. Philip Coombe, the pastor,
delivered a strong sermon on the subject,
"President Roosevelt's Message." After
referring to the significance of the con
vening of Congress, the pastor said:
I make no apology for taking this as a theme
for this morning's service, for this message
reads like a declaration of a Hebrew prophet
and lawyer and as if it were truly inspired.
The statement as to what should be done with
all known anarchists is like an expression of
divine law from Mount Sinai, spoken in the
name of Jehovah, and with the voice of God.
Elsewhere it ha3 the spirit of Moses and the
prophets or is like the sermon on the Mount.
It comes with authority divine and human and
With the authority vested in the author's own
excellence as a man, a leader, a Christian â as
one whose mind is in communion with the di
vine mind, who is spiritually instructed In the
deep things of God which have to do with this
nation's welfare. ,'
President Roosevelt has the right to tell us
about the things which ought to be done and
to eay they must be done. When he expresses
the demand for the development of high moral
character in private citizens and governmental
officials, in employers and employes he simply
points us in the direction in which, in his own
Strenuous life, he has led the way. In his ex
pression of the demand for the recognition of
moral excellence he only states what he himself
has always shown his readiness to honor.
In his demand for justice, justice toward the
enemies of government, and justice in the ad
ministration of the affairs of this nation, and
justice toward other nations and nationalities,
we would do well 'as a people to follow his
lead.
This nation Is not just toward other nations
when It relieves them of the proper duties
â¢which they owe to their own citizens. It is
binding -upon every nation, as It Is binding
upon every individual, to work put Its own
salvation with fear and trembling, God work
ing on that nation to will and to do his own
pleasure. Every nation, is under obligation to
give to its own children, to all who are born
under its flag, the blessings of life that we
enjoy. It is better for every nation to do this
than to thrust its burdens on other nations.
This nation will the better perform its own
duty to other nations as it maintains its own
national character and inspires other nations
to imitate its example. The Old Testament lifts
up its voice against the intermingling of pa
gans with a god-fearing people, and the New
Testament is equally explicit on the same ques
tion. The apostle to the pagans who was will
ing to go anywhere to uplift humanity de
clared on Mare Hill that God had "made of one
blood all nations of men to dwell on all the
face of the earth and hath determined the times
before appointed and the bounds of their hab
itation."
Let me ask you to read President Roosevelt's
message carefully, to pray for its originator and
to support him in hla position in every way
that you can as citizens of this great republic.
POLICEMAN REFUSES
TO MAKE AN ARREST
Timothy Muldowney Assaulted by a
Man in Saloon on Howard
Street.
Timothy Muldowney, 84 South Park, re
ported to the police yesterday that he had
been assaulted by a man in the Examiner
saloon, on Howard street, between Third
and Fourth streets, and that the man
later had threatened In the presence of a
policeman to shoot him. The policeman
refused to arrest Muldowney's assailant,
so Muldowney claimed. '
Muldowney's statement was that he
was in the saloon shortly after midnight
with a friend, and while having a drink
a woman came up to him and asked him
to "treat" her. He placed 10 cents on the
bar and jokingly remarked to the wom
an: "Why don't you wear a coat that nt3
you?" Just then a man stepped up to him
and struck him several times on the face
and head with his flsts. The barkeeper
interfered and the man attempted to
strike Muldowney's friend.
The man went- across the street to
Schmidt's saloon and Muldowney followed
him. The man put his hand in his hip
pocket and said: "If you move a step
farther I will kill you." There was an of
ficer present, but he refused to arrest the
man. Later Muldowney met Policeman
Mitchell and they searched different sa
loons for Muldowney's assailant but could
not find him. Mitchell ascertained, how
ever, that the man's name is Jack Gilles
ple.
Sergeant Mahoney was asked to make
an investigation as to the conduct of the
officer who refused to make the arrest,
and reported that no one attempted to
draw a revolver and that Muldowney was
looking for trouble and got it. The mat
ter will be further, investigated.

ENGINE CRUSHES
ELECTRIC CAR
Vehicle on the Sutro
Line in Collision
With a Train.
Passengers Are Scared, but
None Injured in the \
Accident
What might have proved a serious col
lision occurred at the corner of California
and Walnut streets at 3:30 o'clock yester
day afternoon. A locomotive attached to
a crowded train bound 'for Golden Gate
Park crashed into the rear end of a Sutro
electric car. and had it not been for the
slow motion of the . locomotive death
would, surely have resulted.
The accident appears to have been due
to the failure of the conductor of the
Sutro electric car to observe the rules re
specting the right of way at the crossing
named. It appears from all accounts that
the right of v/ay belongs to the locomotive
whenever cars of the electric line are ap
proaching the crossing. The locomotive,
in charge of Engineer A. Hawkins, and
the train, in charge of Conductors B. H.
Mason and F. Forner, pulled out of the
station at the regular time and ap
proached California street at a speed of
four mlle3 an hour. About the same time
car No. 29 of the Sutro line approached
from the east and crossed the switch
directly in tront of the oncoming locomo
tive.
Engineer Hawkins reversed his engine
when at a distance of twenty feet trom
the Sutro car, which had unaccountably
come to a stop directly on the crossing.
The collision could not be averted and in
the next instant the locomotive c^asheu
into the rear end of th.e car and smashed
the framework into fragments.
Both train and electric car were crowded
with passengers bound for the park and
Cliff House. The car, which was Injured
in the smashap, contained some fifty pas
sengers. The excitement attending the
collision was intense. Men shouted and
women screamed in terror. The car was
raised several feet from the ground, the
rear end resting upon the cow-catcher of
the locomotive. The -passengers made a
scramble for safety, but before they could
leave the car the locomotive had come to
a stop. The passengers on the train, be
lieving the collision had resulted in loss
of life, poured into the street with a view
to rendering such assistance as might be
required. Fortunately no one was injured.
The only result of the affair was the
frighenlng of all concerned and the in
fliction of some ?50 worth of damage to
the rolling stock of the Sutro Company.
Inquiry among the railway employes
last night developed a tendency to shift
the blame for the affair upon the con
ductor of the Sutro car. It was alleged
that if he had given the right of way to
the locomotive the collision would have
been averted. Even after having taken
the road in advance of the approaching
locomotive, it is claimed, he could have
prevented the wrecking: of his car by pro
ceeding on his way. Instead of doing so
he brought his car to a halt, thus inviting
disaster. The affair is under investiga
tion by the companies interested.
MEXICAN PRESS TAKES
UP PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
One Newspaper Says It Is Written in
an Arrogant and Vainglorious
Tone.
CITY OP MEXICO, Dec. 8.â La Patrie
(Liberal) warns the Mexicans that they
may not hope to look to Europe for help
against the North American aggression
so much talked of by the Clerical papers,
but adds: "We fear nothing from the
United States. That great republic
plants Itself on the Monroe doctrine and
that of peace in this hemisphere. The
United States offers as a pledge of Its sin
cerity the support they gave Mexico dur
ing her war with Napoleon III.
El Tiempo (Clerical) after waiting sev
eral days emits its opinion on President
Roosevelt's message, which it says is
Characterized by an arrogant and vain
glorious tone. Roosevelt is a politician
given to talk, whereas McKinley worked
more than he talked. McKinley was more
to be feared as a statesman and politician.
El Correo Espanola, an organ of the
resident Spanish colony, praises Roose
velt's message as being well written and
full of altruism and optimism.

ELIZABETH CITY, N. C, Dec. 8.â The

PITCHER RUBE WADDELL AN ENIGMA TO THE BATSMEN
HARES OUTFOOT
FAST COURSERS
Lively "Jacks" Set Fast
Pace for Dogs at
Union Park.
Oharta Beats Ireland for the
Honors in Special
Stake.
"As good a day's sport as has been seen
on a coursing Held," > was the unanimous
verdict of the crowd of enthusiasts that
filled the stands yesterday at Union
Coursing Park. Leashmen who have
patronized the game season after season
and who are classed as veterans admitted
that the hard-fought and interesting
trials were far and above any they ha a
â witnessed on the local field since the in
auguration of the sport on the coast.
Lively hares were responsible lor the
big scores, and the speediest dogs at the
park were lorced to go tne time limit. In
many instances they were beaten out by
the hares.
fcileety Mist won the open stake by de
fault, Leola, which had workea her way
to the linal, bting withdrawn because of
previous hara running. Sleety, too, had
some severe going, ner bye with May
Hempstead in the semi-tinai reaching tne
limit. * reeze out looked a good chance
for the stake, but in a ciose course in the
sixth round fell a victim to L*ola.'s clev
erness.
Charta won the special stake, beating
Ireland 7 to a in the deciding course. Palo
Alto, the even money stake favorite,
seemed to have a strong cnance for the
final. The champion had the speed, but in
the second round Warsnip, his opponent,
was favored by the nare, and wnen ttiti
course enaed .falo Alto was on the short
end of the score. The defeat of Geary's
courser hurt the feelings ot tfie talent
somewhat, the wise ones having backed
him at 1 to tt.
Silver Cloud and his kennel mate, Hap
hazard, as the â¢'bye" dog were slipped to
a. demon hare, that took them all over the
tieid and kept them going- the full limit.
Two relief oogs joined in the chase, and
they, too, were given a hard run. 'lhe
hare beat the quartet handily and es
caped.
favorites won as a rule, an even dozen
upsets, averaging at odds of 3 to 5, being
recorded.

IN MATCH GAMES
Crowell and Collier Win
the Davis Cups
Again. Â»
Place Third Victory to Their
Credit for the Tro
phies.
The handicap doubles tournament for
the Davis cups held yesterday on the Cal
ifornia Tennis Club courts was won in a
clever fashion by H. W. Crowell and W.
B. Collier. This is the third time the team
has won a tournament of this kind. By
winning the cups twice more they will
gain permanent possession of them. The
opposing team in the finals was Chet
Smith and James Code, the holders.
Twelve teams contested and in the pre
liminary round four matches were played.
The first was between R. B. Cornell and
R. N. Whitney and the Wood brothers.
The latter received odds of "thirty" and
lost after a close struggle, the score being
5â7, 7â5, &â 1.
Frank Stringham and Will Allen al
lowed John Gibson and Herbert Schmidt
odds of "fifteen" and won in straight sets,
6â1, 6â4. C. Smith and Code received odds
of "fifteen" from Merle Johnson and Gus
Taylor and won. 2â6, 6â3, 6â4. Page Col
lier and Harry Gorham received "half fif
teen" from Homer Parker and Carl Gard
ner and 'won in straight sets, 6 â 3, 6 â 3.
In the first round Dick Adams and
James McKenzie received odds of "fifteen
and owe half fifteen" from Collier and
Crowell. With the score standing 6â3,
2â45. 3â3, Adams and McKenzie withdrew
and the match went to their opponents by
default. In the next match, when the
score stood 6â3, 2â6, 3â2, Cornell and
Whitney defaulted to Stringham and Al
len. The latter received odds of â¢'fifteen."
Smith and Code allowed P. Collier and
Gorham odds of "half fifteen" and won in
straight sets, 7 â 5, 6 â 3. In the last match
of this round Paul Jones and Herman
Powers allowed Clyde Beal and Al Ken
yon odds of "fifteen and owe half fifteen."
The latter won in straight sets, 8â6, 6â2.
In the semi-finals both matches were ex
ceedingly close, and in each the winning
team were victors after losing the first
set. Collier and Crowell allowed String
ham and Allen "fifteen" and won, 3â6,
6â2, 6â2. The scratch men were slow to
start, but when once fairly under way
they won handily. The match between
Hunt and Code and Beal apd Kenyon was
a repetition of the preceding match. Beal
and Kenyon were allowed odds of "half
thirty" and won the first set. The next
two sets were taken easily by Smith and
Code. The score in their favor was 4â6,
6-2, 6-L
The final match between Collier and
Crowell and Smith and Code was the best
of the day. The former allowed the latter
odds of "fifteen" and won, 6â4, 2â6, 6â0.
Young Smith played a fine game in this
match, especially in the first and second
sets. His efforts left him tired in the last
set. His smashing was swift and his
drives well placed.
In a practice match A. W. Worthington
beat Joe Daily, 6â0. 6â0, 6â0. The winner
has been improving rapidly of late, and
although his style is peculiar it is effec
tive. Worthington allowed Mr. Hendry
odds of "thirty" and was beaten, 2 â 6, 6â4,
7â5.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1901.
STRIKES OUT HEAVY HITTERS
OF THE HOflE TEAM CLEVERLY
&^yv3 EN thousand spectators ; saw
I Waddell, the' wizard
1 1 pitcher, make a spectacle of the
II heavy batsmen of the San Fran-
cisco baseball team yesterday at
Recreation Park. He struck out twelve
men, showing wonderful control over the
ball, together with astonishing speed. The
game was won by the visitors by a
score of 4 to 2. .
V The fielding of the home team could
hardly have been worse, some of the
errors being at once costly and inex
cusable. For a moment in the last inning
it seemed the Wasps might tie the score,
Schwartz and Krug lining out two-bag
gers. Tne net resuu was one run ana tne
game was over.
The crowd iormed a fringe around the
entire field. Berore piay commenced it
was agreed tnat a hit into tne crowd
would mean a two-Dagger ana a wild
tnrow wouiu entitle a runner to one base.
The spectators overflowed the grounds
in every direction. Long before the game
commenced tne management ceased sell
ing uckets.as iheavaiiaoie stanuing room
was occupied. It is estimated nearly
three thousand people were turned away
irom the Kates.
Wadaell outshone all the other Eastern
stars. In the sixth inning "Jfoungey"
Johnson was sent out to coach in an en
deavor to rattle "Kube." The two base
ball comedians tried to outdo one another
in amusing the spectators and succeeded
admirably. When "Rube" found the new
man on tne coachers' line he gravely bow
ed and took off his cap. Later in the
inning he walked over and shook hands
with Johnson. â¢
After the game some spectator threw
a cushion onto the field from the stand.
Another and then another was thrown
until the air was filled with the harmless
missiles. They were thrown back into
the grand stand and returned again; In'
the metee a policeman's helmet was
knocked off. i Its owner added to the
hilarity of the occasion by chasing a
small boy In and out among the thou
sands of spectators who had ma'de their
way. to the field. No arrests.
The All-Americas scored their first run
in the fourth. Barrett, the first man up
hit past Iburg, the ball bounding off his
glove and out toward Krug. Barrett was
safe before it could be fielded to first.
Mercer was safe on Shay's fumble. La
joie hit to Shay and forced Barrett at
third. Davis flew to deep left field and
Mercer scored on the throw in. Bradley
hit to shortstop and was out, retiring the
side. \
Waddell rang up a tally in the fifth
through Parke Wilson's dropping the ball
when he had the eccentric Easterner safe
ly out. Irwin was the first batter up and
sent the ball straight into Nordyke's
hands at first. Sullivan was safe on
Shay's juggling of his hit. Waddell sin
gled. Pickering hit to pitcher, who threw
Sullivan out at third. Barrett singled
and Waddell came home on the play.
Wilson had the ball in ample time to put
him out. and the spectators Thought he
had done so until it was seen he had
dropped the ball. Pickering moved up to
third on Reilly's fumble. Mercer ended
the trouble by going out on a fly.
Two runs were scored in the sixth
Krug's error being a factor in the play.
Lajoie, the great, started proceedings
by flying cut. Davis singled, being safe
on Nordyke dropping the ball at first
base. Bradley singled, sending Davis to
third. Irwin was hit by the pitcher, fill
ing the bases. Sullivan singled to short
stop and Shay tossed the ball easily to
Krug. The latter dropped the ball and
did not see where it rolled. Before it

Southern Reservation In
dians in a Sad Pre
dicament.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 8.â In about three
weeks the Department of . Indian Affairs
at Washington will have laid before it a
report from Major James â¢â¢ McLaughlin
and Indian Agent Wright, on which will
be based a decision as to what Is to be
done With the Indians at present in the
reservation on Warner's ra.nch.
These Indians In five reservationsâ
Puerta La Cruz, Mataguay, Puerta Chi
clta, San Jose and Agua Calienteâ must
be moved soon, for the decision of the
Supreme Federal Court is that the, land
belongs to J. Downey Harvey of Los An
geles, and that the Government never had
a right to locate the reservations on the
ranch.
The case of the Indians on the San Fe
lipe ranch is practically the same, though
the decision of the court has not yet been
written. Major McLaughlin states that
the Government has given up the Idea
that there is any Government land In this
section of the country which Is. suitable
for a reservation, for every piece of land
that is tillable has long since been taken
by white settlers and even some of the
reservations, as they are now located, are
on the sides of mountains where the In
dians have a hard time to exist. .
The two officials have been making a
"ten days' trip through the valleys of San
Diego County looking at certain lands
which had been considered - suitable for
reservations, and which had been offered
to the Government. At least 2000 acres. of
areable land is wanted with a water sup
ply that can be used for Irrigation. Two
or three suitable locations have * been
found on the trip and the two agents have

could be recovered Davis' and Bradley
had made good use of their time and had
scored. Waddell struck out and Irwin
was caught out at the home plate In an
attempt at a double steal. The ball was
sent down to second to head off a runner
and was. returned in time to catch Irwin.
The home team scored their first run in
the sixth. Reilly flew to shortstop and
Iburg struck out. Nordyke, the hero nf
Saturday's game, was next at bat. He
hit the ball in the same direction as that
taken by it on Saturday when he sent It
over the fence. This time it struck the
wrong side of the fence and fell among
the spectators. Under the ground rules
in force he was allowed only two bases
on the hit.
Wilson followed with a* single to Ir
win. The latter fell and rolled "over sev
eral times In his efforts to catch and field
the ball. Nordyke scored before Irwin
recovered. Hildebrand hit to the pitcher
and was out.
Schwartz scored the second and last
run for the Wasps in the ninth. Hilde
brand was the first man up and was
thrown out at first by Bradley. Schwartz
lined ' out a two-bagger. Pabst flew to
center and Krug singled, scoring
Schwartz. Shay flew out, ending the
game.
On Wednesday afternoc.i the same
teams will t>lay. the only change being in
the pitcher's department. Bernhard will
be in the box for the visitors and Whalen
for the home team. On Thursday and
Friday the visitors will play the Oaklands
and on Saturday and Sunday the Sacra

ANGELS WIN DOWN SOUTH.
Heavy Hitting Defeats the National
League Team.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 8.â Five thousand
people saw ,Morley's heavv hitters take
the second baseball game from the Na
tionals by a score of -9 to 2. It was. a
game, full of batting, clever fielding and
constant kicking. ' Both teams took turns
objecting against Decker's decisions.
Some of the objections were not without
cause. Decker appeared erratic on balls
and strikes. "Buck" Francks took Steln
feld's place at short and played a bril
liant game. His fielding of a liner from
HamphilFs bat In the seventh was a
clever piece of work. Hulen played third
for the visitors, McHale going to left
field. Van Haltren appeared off in his
fielding, two errors being marked up
against him. - â¢
The Angels commenced scoring in the
first inning. Hemphill singled, House
holder walked, and Kihm's hit to left
went past McHale, scoring Hemphill and
Householder. Hall lined out a high one
to center, which Van Haltren fumbled.
Hall stole second, and Chance's wild
throw allowed Kihm to score. Reilly fol
lowed' with a safe hit to left field, scor
ing Hall. Again in the sixth and sev
enth Innings the Los Angeles batters fell
on Doyle's curves, and five men made
their bases. In the seventh Klhm sent
the ball soaring far above the left field
fence for a home run. Hall also dropped
a three-bagger in center field.
Hartwell's nervousness allowed the Na
tionals to make three runs in the fourth.
He became rattled and threw wild to
first instead of catching Hulen at the
plate. He steadied down, however, and,
with good support, held the visitors
down until' the seventh, vhen Dougher
ty's error in letting McHale's single go
under the fence cost three runs. Bat
teriesâHartwell and Spies, Doyle and
Chance.

THROUGH IDAHO
Karriman Syndicate to
Open Rich Western
District.
Oregon Short Line Engineers
Surveying the Route for
an Extension.
i?j>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Dec. 8.â A party of Ore
son Short Line engineers has started
upon the work of surveying an extension
of the new branch running from Black
f(KÂ» Idaho, to Mackay. Idaho. The ulti
mate objective point of the Short Line in
this extension is neither Challis. Salmci
City nor Thunder Mountain. If a feasible
route can be iound the road will be built
through to Lewiston, Idaho, on the west
ern border of the State, and there it will
connect with a proposed branch of the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany, or may itself build farther to a
connection with that part of the Harri
raan system, probably at Grange City
Junction. Wash. The Harriman system
has in contemplation a plan involving the
expenditure of millions of dollars and the
construction of a line with feeders
traversing the entire central 1 of Idaho
and opening probably the richest mineral,
agricultural and timber section of the
West that is at present without a rail
road.
The party of engineers now in the field
will run a line as far as Challis, Idaho.
In the spring a survey will be run to the
vicinity of Thunder Mountain, the new
Idaho gold camp. This may be the stop
ping place for a time. Later the read wni
be continued toward the northwest from
this point.
The probabilities are that if a direct
route across the mountains to the Sal
mon River could not be located the mid
dle fork would be followed north to the
main stream and then the course of the
stream generally followed, with such dis
tance-saving variations as the country
would permit. It is possible that the Sal
mon would be followed to the Snake and
that stream paralleled to Lewiston.
Another route which is said to be feas
ible is to leave the course of the Salmon
neafr the Buffalo Hump Mountains, strik
ing northward across the range at its
me*?: approachable point, probably near
American Creek, and following that
stream and the south fork of the Ctear
water to Mount Idaho. From Mount
Idaho to Lewiston and thence to Grange
Oty Junction, Wash., on the Spokane line
of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company, that road has a survey, made
during the Buffalo Hump excitement.
This survey could be followed or a di
vergence could be made from Lewiston
north to Moscow. The latter route, if
found practicable, gives a more direct line
to Spokane. In either event connection
would be made with the Oregon Railroad
and Navigation line and the Northern Pa
cific.
HUGH CEAIG DESCRIBES
LAWS OF NEW ZEALAND
lells of Good Results Accomplished
by Compulsory Arbitration '
Laws of Island. '
Hugh Craig lectured last night at
Metropolitan Temple under the auspices
of the Liberty Branch of the Socialist \
part on "Xew Zealand." He gave an en- j
tertainir.g description of the traditionary \
history, people and topography of the â 
island, but for the most part his remarks
were confined to the industrial legislation
M if New Zealand. He deelared that the j
fecple of the island are as far ahead of !
the people of the United States to-day in
industrial legislation as the United States â 
was ahead of Europe 100 years agd: The j
iich citizens of New Zealand, he said, i
bought up ail the land, thus depriving
their poorer brethren of the opportunity
of making a livelihood. He pointed out
that this condition cf affairs led the peo
ple to take the legislation into their own
hands and to legislate for their own inter
ests. Mr. Craig declared that by the pas
sage of a land tax the rich were forced to
forfeit their monopoly on the land. The
people also enacted an income tax, he
said.
In describing the New Zealand Govern
ment he said that Ministers were ap
pointed to look after the railroads, the
mines and also the interests of labor. The
speaker Kaid that in the Island railroads,
telegraph, water rights and other public
utilities are owned by the Government.
The greater part of the conclusion of his
lecture was devoted to the industrial con
ciliation and compulsory arbitration law,
which, he declared, was one of the great
est achievements of New Zealand legisla
tion, in that it secured the peaceable ad
justment of all quarrels betwen labor and
'capital.

FUNERAL OF LATE GEORGE H. CARLETON
Caklanders Mourn at Bier
of Uprigh> City Employe
Whose Term Ends Forever
OAKLAND. Dec. 8.â The body of
George H. Carleton, late Superin
tendent of Fire Alarm and Police
Telegraph, whose long and faith-
ful service to the city ended in
sudden death last Thursday, was this
afternoon buried at Mountain View Cem
etery with all the honor a sorrowing com
munity could bestow. ;;â â¢"".
The funeral services were conducted by
the officers of Live Oak Lodge No. , 61,
F. and A. M., of which organization de
ceased was a well loved member. The
city officials from Mayor to humblest
employe took their place In the proces
sional march to the grave. A military
band marked mournful time, and a
company of State soldiers marched be
hind the musicians in tribute to the
worth of the dead citizen.
The Police and Fire departments were
fittingly represented.
Every seat in the First Congregational
Church was occupied during the funeral
services, and many of the 2000 and more
that attended followed the cortege to
the place of burial. . " â â¢
The tribute paid to George Carleton by
the public of Oakland was expected. The
best part of his life had been lived in
this city, and his career had been one of
ideal civic usefulness. The tribute paid
hi-; memory by his brother Masons speaks
more than words for the deceased's
standing among men. In addition to
the members of his own lodge at least
500 Masons from all parts of the State
and many visitors from Eastern cities
jcined in paying a Mason's tribute to
the worth of a dead brother.
His Cld Company Turns Out.
Carleton was an active member of the
old Oakland Guard. When this organiza-
tion was merged into the State militia
it still retained a certain individual
identity as Company A of the Fifth
Regiment. In this company Carleton al
ways took a personal pr^de, and it turned .
out to-day with its band to pay a tri
bute to the memory of a dead comrade.

DEFECTS APPEAR
IN BATTLESHIP
Board of Engineers May
Examine the New
Illinois.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 8.â Serious de
fects have manifested themselves in the
machinery of the battleship Illinois, row
in this port, and it is more than probable
that a board of naval engineers will be
named by the department to examine her
engines piece by piece. James Rowbot
tom, superintendent of machinery of the
Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry
dock Company, reached New Orleans to
day to investigate complaints which have
been made to the department and which
have bÂ«en referred to the company.
On the Illinois' voyage to New Or
leans great cracks developed in the cyl
inder flanges and heads. Other defects
were located both in the starboard and
port engines. It is said that the cylinder
flanges are not only badly cracked, but
the cylinders themselves are defective.
In the event that the board of engineers
convenes here it is believed the Il
linois will return at once to the ship
yard at Newport News, where she was
built, and the defective machinery be
recast.

LONDON MARKET

The President's Message

LONDON, Dec. S.âThe outlook on the
Stock Exchange was somewhat brighter
during ths past week, owing to the mes
sage from President Roosevelt, the speech
of the Prince of Wales and the unex
pectedly heavy captures in South Africa.
These latter also helped the market for
mining shares, and Kaffirs rose slightly,
The money situation was satisfactory,
as there was no prospect of stringency in
New York. Paris and Berlin bill's. It Is
thought this promised situation, combined
with the present low price of stock, will
stimulate both investment and specula
tion.
The volume of business to date is still
limited. American securities were lethar
gic, in spite of the improvement of Wall
street.
The silver situation is still critical, al
though silver has recovered slightly from
its lowest quotation. The future of silver
is said to depend entirely .upon whether
tho United States refrain from pressing
future sales.
BERLIN. Dec. 8.â The Boerse did not
show a uniform tendency during the past
week, and while there was a dull move
ment in domestic shares, industrials were
exhausted.
Iron and coal shares continued strong
until Friday.. when a reaction began. This
was in response to the renewed dismal
news from tho producing centers, which
caused the falls in prices recorded on
Friday and Saturday, and which brought
quotations from 2 to 4 below, the previous
week.
The only support for iron shares was in
the cabled reports from the United States.
The shares of oceanic steamship com
panies received a setback from the mes
sage of President Roosevelt.' They par
tially recovered, however, toward the end
of the week. / â¢ â¢ -

BASQUE BALL
DRAWING WELL
Exciting Sport Vasco
Attracts Crowds to
Central Park.
The game of basque ball now being
played four days of each week at Centra)
Park seems billed to become a fad in this
country. The game was recently import
ed from Mexico, it having had its birth in
France about fifteen years ago. The Span
iards, then took it up, and experts went
to South America, where it met with great
favor. It has now been Introduced into
the United States in the belief that it will
become popular on account of the unusual
skill required by tho players in scoring
the various points to fee made under the
rules of the game.
A large crowd of curious spectators was
present at the. contests yesterday. Three
matches were played by the Spanish con
testants, and In the course of the matches
some very interesting plays were made.
Even to those who do not understand the
game the spectacle of seein" men scoop
up a swiftly flying bail in an arrangement
shaped like a boomerang and then sweep
ing it away again apparently without ef
fort proved a distinct novelty. Whenever
a ball was muffed by a player, or when it
flew too hifeh and scraped the wire net
ting on the walls, the bell rang and the
opposing players were given a point. Tho
plays were fast and furious at times, and
on these occasions the applause was gen
erous. That the players are experts in
their line, is incontestable.
Lovers of handball will appreciate this
basque ball for the reason that the. games
are quite similar. An inclosure similar to
that of a handball court, only much
larger, is provided. The wall against
which the ball is thrown by the players
Is fifty feet high and, j Is called tho
"front!." About 200 feet away is another
v/all of a lesser height, which is called
the "rebote," and against which the ball
rebounds. Connecting the | walls is an
other of equal height, thus forming a
court forty feet wide, â which is paved with
artificial stone. This court is called the
"cancha." 'The players are disposed ac
cording to the requirements of the game
within the cancha, each holding "la ch|s
tera," an apparatus- formed of twigs in
the shape of a horn of plenty, open on
one side. The ball is caught with clever
ness by the players in the chistera, and
with one sweep of the arm sent forth
again with lightning-like 6peed. The ball
must be caught on the fly as it rebounds
from the frontis, or on. the first rebound.
Should a player fail in accomplishing this
his opponent scores. The manipulation of
the, ball and the rapidity with which it is
passed about among the opposing teams
fascinates spectators and frequently
rouses them to tho- manifestation of. con?
siderable enthusiasm.
It is the belief of local handball men
that the new game will become popular
with the masses after it is once under-
Stood. A company has been formed. tQ In
troduce the game, and the construction
of a court in Central Park necessitated
the expenditure of $35,000.. Fifteen Span
iards who are experts at the game were
brought to this city, and they play in
matches four days of each week. The
crowds are becoming larger dally, and
when the beauties of the game are more
generally realized there can be no ques
tion that the investment by the company
will become profitable.

RUSSIAN POLICE
EXPEL LECTURER
Drive Siberian Explorer
Out of the City of
St. Petersburg.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 8.â Vladimir
Bogoraz, leader of the Siberian depart
ment of the Jesup North Pacific expedU
tion, who returned to St. Petersburg a
month ago after nearly a year and a. half
of exploration in North Siberia, was in
vited to lecture before the Imperial Gee)
graphical Society in this city last night.
A large company assembled to hear him,
but word came at the last moment that
he had been expelled from the city by the
police. The cause of this action was said
to be an article published -by Bogoraz, in
a local .newspaper.
Instead of Bogoraz' s lecture a letter was
read from his companion, Vladimir Jack
elson, who is still in Siberia. Jackelson
said that anthrometric measurements had
been made among the Kariaks and three
skulls obtained. Thirty phonographic cyl
inders were filled with Kariak utterances
and songs. Clay objects were found by
excavations. This is held to prove that a
higher civilization once prevailed in Kam
schatka, since the present tribes are ig
norant of pottery.
The â¢ expedition left San . Francisco
March 17, 1900, for Vladivostok to gather
material about "the origin of the American
races and their affinities with Asiatic
tribes. In June, 1900, Bogoraz went to the
Anodyr country, and July 24 Jackelson
and his companion, Axelrad of Zurich,
â went to Gijlga. Bogoraz made a study
of the Kam6chatkan and Kariaks and
then proceeded northward nearly to Ber
ing Straits. He sledged about 10,000 vergts,
His entire collection embraces 12,000 ob
jects, and a comparative grammar of the
native languages shows them to belong to
the Eskimo group. â¢
Another member of the expedition, Nor
man Buxton, who directed the zoological
ami botonlcal work, shipped sixty-five
tons of collections to New York by sea.
Buxton left Vladivostok October 24 and
reached Moscow after twenty-one days.
On the way over Buxton fell in with some
of the American miners who have been
engaged In Mongolia by the Russo-Ch}
nese bank. They have been released for
the winter, as necessary, machinery must
be brought into the country before the
mining work can proceed.

GBEAT MASS OF LOGS
RACES IN A RIVER
Serious Damage Is Done to Property
of Firms in Western
Washington.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 8.â Rains and
high water during the past week have
caused much damage to logging: opera
tions in Western Washington rivers. On
the Hamptulip River the new boom is a
complete wreck. The jam pier and sur
rounding dolphins have disappeared.
Seven hundred thousand feet of logs, a
mass half a mile long and 250 feet wide,
bore down on the immense pier, swept
everything before it and then jammed
hard on a bar. Contractor Creech and
crew were lying not over 200 feet below
where the monster mass was stopped.
A man la always welcome to what he
neither wants nor needs. -^ "

PROMISES NEW
GIFT TO PEOPLE
Carnegie to Give Ten
Millions More to
Education.
University Extension Will
Receive the Splendid
Benefaction.
CHICAGO, Dec. 9.â A dispatch to thÂ»
Record-Herald from Washington sa>s:
Andrew Carnegie is to give $10,000,000 to
the cause of university extension In the
United States. Announcement of this
great gift to education will be made at
the White House on Tuesday. Mr. Car
negie was here' a few days ago and took
luncheon with President Roosevelt, when
details of the plan were fully discussed.
Mr. Carnegie has thought best to create
a national board to handle this munificent
benefaction. President Roosevelt will
probably name such a board for Mr. Ciif
negie, or at least set in motion the ma
chinery which shall lead to a national or
ganization.
Mr. Carnegie is expected here to-mor
row or on Tuesday and fuller details or
this gigantic enterprise will soon become
public. '
Nicholas Murray Butler, who has suc
ceeded Seth Low at the head of Colum
bia College, ha3 been here for two days,
a guest of President Roosevelt at the
White House, and he has aided in perfect
ing the plans. Mr. Butler left for New-
York at 4. o'clock this afternoon and be
fore going refused to give any particulars
beyond the information that an announce
ment would be made on Tuesday at the
White House. Mr. Butler has long been
one of the foremost champions of univer
sity extension and it is understood Mr.
Carnegie has had frequent consultations
with him concerning the enterprise.
According to the plans prepared by Mr.
Carnegie and his advisers, the national
organization is to have its headquarters
in Washington, but its operations are to
extend throughout the United States, the
work to be carried on in co-operation wlUx.
universities everywhere.

Early last week Mrs. Fleishman re
mained longer than' the daughters wished
and was asked to depart. When she de
clined Mary Frisbie struck her. She waa

taken into custody and asked the arrest
ing officer to excuse him for a moment.
He has not been seen since.

CREW OF PROTET IS MUSTERED
TO HEAR MASS ABOARD VESSEL
Most Elaborate Church Service Ever Held on the Bay Is Celebrated
Aboard the French Cruiser, Consul of Republic Being Present.
Steamboat- J. D. Peters Crashes Into and Damages a Bulkhead
The most elaborate church service ever
held on the bay was carried out on the
French cruiser Protet yesterday morning.
At 10 o'clock the entire crew was assem
bled and priests from St. Mary's Cathe
dral held low mass. The French Consul
was present, but not officially, and quite
a number of the French colony. The for
ward deck had been canvased in for the
occasion and bunting: made the scene pic
turesque. The sailors and marines sat in
the background, while the officers sat
nearest the temporary altar.
After the service there was a general
shore leave order. More than 100 of the
sailors came ashore. Later fifty more men
were given leave.
While the sailors -were â¢ going ashore
hundreds of visitors were going out to
the cruiser. They roamed all over her for
nearly four hours and came ashore in Pe
terson's launches, saying she was a splen
did ship.
The Protet leaves to-day for the Mare
Island navy yard. There she will be over
hauled and made ready for another cruise
in the Southern seas.
Crashed Into the Wharf.
The California Navigation. and Improve
ment Company's J. D. Peters made havoc
with the bulkhead between Washington
and Jackson street wharves yesterday
morning. She was making a landing after
arriving from Stockton and on account of
the tide had to come into the slip under a
"full-speed" bell. The order to go "full
speed astern" after the steamer had en
tered the slip was not enough to overcome
the momentum and she crashed into the
bulkhead. The vessel was not damaged
to any great extent, but the bulkhead was
cut into nearly eight 'feet, and the Har
bor Commissioners will have to make
some repairs to-day.
Movements of Transports.
The Sheridan went alongside the south
side of the transport wharf yesterday and
at once began loading for Manila./ The
Hancock is on the north side of the wharf
and is coaling. It is thought both vessels
will get away about the middle of the
month. The Thomas is now eighteen days
from Manila and her crew will be here in
time for Christmas. The men on the
Thomas and Sheridan are dissatisfied, be
cause they made sure that they would at
least have the holidays to spend in San
Francisco.
Many Coasters Arrive.
Not a solitary wind-jammer made port
yesterday, but the steam colliers and
steam schooners came in one after the
other. Among the arrivals were the
Washtenaw and City of Puebla from the
Sound, the Del Norte from Redondo, the
Rival from South Coast, National from
Fort Bragg, Pleiades from Seattle, Sco
tia from Bowens Landing, Celia from
Mendocino, State of California from San
Diego, Gipsy from Moss Landing and Eu
reka and Luella from Eureka. The Luella
was the first to arrive, but she left sev
eral hours ahead of her rival..

REPORTS SEEING
BODIES AFLOAT
Possible Remains of San
Rafael Wreck Vic
tims at Beach.
One Boy Says He Observed
Corpses, Another Finds
Life-Preserver.
What may possibly be the remains of
two victims of the collision between the
Sausalito and Sail Rafael are supposed to
be floating In the vicinity of the Heads.
John Young, 13 years old, and residing at
3787 Sacramento street, declares he saw
two bodies, close to shore, in the bight
between Bakers Beach and Fort Point
yesterday afternoon. The matter was re
ported to the Morgue, l^ater in the after
noon a life preserver, which had not been
in the water many days, was found by
Willie HcGuire, who resides in the same
neighborhood, but was not cognizant un
til later of Young's find.
Young's story is that he left his home
about noon yesterday on his bicycle for a
ride around the beach. He went tnrough
the Presidio, past Fort Point and then
along the blufts overlooking the bay and
ocean When he was about half way be
tween Fort Point and the life saving sta
tion he saw two dark objects floating in the
surf, and he climbed down the steep oanKs
to get nearer to them. He was almost
close enough to touch them, but hesitated,
and the bodies, buffeted around by the
waves and the ebb tide, were in his view
sufficiently long for him to get a fairly
accurate description of them.
Young climbed the bill, mounted his
wheel and hurried homeward. He notified
James Ryan, a grocer, who conducts a
store at 37S9 Sacramento street, of what
he had seen. Ryan Jumped on his wheel
and with Young returned to the spot. No
trace of the bodies could be found. A large
number of people were on the beach when
they returned, and as they proceeded
from Land's End to Fort Point they asked
each one they met If any floating objects
had been seen, but no* one had seen any
bodies.
While they were making these inquiries
young McGuire picked up the life pre
server. It was one of the sectional kind,
made of tules. 6uch as are on most of the
bay steamers. It was waterlogged and
very heavy. There was nothing on it to
indicate from what vessel it came. After
carrying it for some distance McGuire got
tired of his burden and hid the life pre-.
server among some rocks, where he thinks
he can find it again.
After their patrol of the beach Ryan,
Young and McGuire returned homa. Ryan
informed the Morgue of Young's state
ments and added the description of the
bodies seen by Young. Ryan said:
As soon as the lad informed me of what be
had seen. I lost no time in returning with
him, but we could find no trace of any bodies.
The ebb tide was running Etroxur and the
breakers were piling high on the beach. About
one hour's time was consumed from the time
Young saw the bodies until I returned with
him.
Apparently the bodies were those of middle
aged men, and Youns: was close enougrh to
touch one of them. He pave me a description
of them. Tan shoes and a dark suit were on
one. This man had been the possessor of a
brown mustache. On the other body was a
black fu it, and a dark mustache covered the
Up. Both bodies were considerably swollen. A
finger of one bore a gold ring. The other
Ehowed traces of having been eaten by crabs.
The boy repeated his story to a dozen differ
ent persons and I am sure he was telling the
truth.
At Young's residence It was stated that
he had retired and his father referred all
Inquirers to Grocer Ryan. McGuire said
he was on the beach about half an hour
after Young claimed to have seen the
bodies, but he saw nothing of them, al
though he picked up the life preserver al
most at the same spot. He says he can
find the life preserver at any time that it
is wanted.
SUCCESSFUL RAID ON
SANGUINETTI GAME
E. Allegrini, Saloon Man, Arrested
, as the Keeper and Five Men
as Visitors.
Chief Wittman Is keeping up his cru
eade against percentage gambling of all
torts, and now that he has put a. stop to
the nickel-in-the-slot machine play Of
ficers Levlngs and Wedekind have been
working on other lines.
It had been suspected for a long time
that the game of "sanguinetti," which is
known as Italian faro, was being played
in the rear of a saloon at 400 Broadway.
The two officers were successful late Sat
urday night in finding the game in full
blast. They arrested R. Allegrini as ths
keeper and Xicola Curiala, B. Demetrio
C. Salvatore. G. Barcelli and S. Corso as
visitors. They were all released on bonds.
The Chief said yesterday that Allegrini
will be cited to appear before the Police
Commissioners to-morrow night to show
cause why his liquor license should not be
revoked for allowing gambling on his
premiEeB.
Becover Stolen Cigars.
Detectives Regan and O'Connell yester
day recovered 350 cigars from Crowley &
Ecker's saloon, 17 Mason street, which
had been stolen from the Oregon Steam
ship Company's wharf, foot of Spear
etreet. by James Purcell, Matthew Qulnn
and John Clark, who were arrested on a
charge of grand larceny. When Crowley
â¢was notified that the cigars had been
stolen he surrendered them without put
ting the officers to the trouble of procur
ing a search warrant. The cigars were
taken to the property clerk's office. Yes
terday they recovered a bale and a haif
of tobacco from M. F. Crowley's grocery
221 Bryant street, which was stolen at the
same time.

AND TWO FELLOW-BOHEMIANS
Ten Pleasure Seekers in a Launcfi Meet With Unexpected Acci

boat Off Presidio Shore and Heroic Rescues Are Attempted
HARRY HOLBROOK AND OTHER BOHEMIAN CLUB MEMBERS TAKE TO THE WATER OFF THE PRESIDIO
SHORE WHILE RETURNING ON A LAUNCH FROM MARE ISLAND TO SAN FRANCISCO AND AN EX
CITING STRUGGLE IN THE SHALLOW WATERS OF THE BAY FOLLOWS.
HELP! Save me! I'm In the
water and it's cold!" cried
Harry Holbrook, floundering in
the bay dressed In his Sunday
best. "Help, help! I want to
get out! It's cold!"
Cyrus Miller, U. S. V., rushed on deck
of the little launch that carried ten Bo
hemians on a pleasure jaunt yesterday to
Mare Island and back again.
"Man overboard on the starboard side!"
Miller shouted, and leaped in the bay,
swimming out to the sputtering Holbrook.
H. Davis, one of those aboard, was in a
heroic mood also, and he tried to earn a
life-saving medal right off the reel. Da
vis' Intentions were good, but he had
never learned the art of swimming. He
took a dive overboard, but floundered in
more noticeable fashion than Holbrook.
Luckily another launch happened to be
within easy reach and all were saved.
Just about this time Jack Wilson was
stripping to follow his friends either to
glory or to the bottom of the bay. Had
Wilson tried heroics the panic would have
been general and there would have been
ten Bohemian Club men sputtering
through salt water for help and salva
tion. Holbrook, Miller and Davis were
afterward taken to the Harbor Hospital
for resuscitation. At a late hour last
night they were In their homes and on
the speediest of roads to an absolute re
covery.

MORE HOLD-UPS
ARE REPORTED
S. Simpson Knocked
Down and Robbed on
Howard Street.
For some weeks past a number of rob
beries have been reported each Sunday
morning. Yesterday morning two men re
ported to the police that they had been
held up in the district south of Market
street, one by three young men, and the
other by a man with a revolver in his
hand.
S. Simpson, a housemover, living at 11
Decatur street, was on his way home
about 3 o'clock and while on Howard
street, between Fourth and Fifth streets,
three young men knocked him down and
robbed him of a nickel watch and a
nickel, which was the only coin he had in
his pockets. They ran along Howard
street and disappeared down Fourth. He
was unable to give a description of them.
Charles Bergeman, 35 Stanley place, re
ported that shortly after midnight, while
ne was walking along Bryant street, be
tween Second and Third, a man stepped
out from the shadow of a building and,
presenting a revolver at his head, de
manded his money. The robber went
through Bergeman's pockets but found
nothing. He then told Bergeman to walk
in the direction of Third street and not
make any outcry or he would shoot him.
J. Condon, residing at 16 Chesley street,
was attacked by five men on Harrison
street, between Seventh' and Eighth, yes
terday afternoon and after being knocked
down was robbed of $5 and a gold watch.
Condon was walking along the street
when he was hit from, behind and felled
to the sidewalk. He was kicked about the
head and face. One of the hoodlums
searched his pockets, taking what money
he had. The injured man was treated at
the Emergency Hospital for an extensive
lacerated wound over the left ear and sev
eral contused wounds of the face. The
robbery was reported to Captain Spillane,
who detailed a special officer on the case.
Philip Krell, a. showcase manufacturer,
after dining with some friends at a
restaurant on Pine street, below Mont
gomery, left them about 1:30 o'clock last
night and proceeded to the corner of Cali
fornia and Sansome streets. As he neared
the corner a man aDproached. pointed a
pistol at his head and demanded his
money. Krell grappled with his assail
ant and called for the police.
The robber grabbed. Krell's watch am
chain and attempted to get awav, bu
Krell held on to his man until Offlcen
Leonard and Farrell came up and ar
rested the would-be robber. During th<
melee the watch taken from Krell wai
thrown away. The robber also got rid oi
his pistol. A search was made for th<
missing nroperty and it was found neai
the scene of the struggle.

of those unwashed by the sad green
waves, "that we thought we would spend
the Sabbath on the bay."
Ten Bohemians went out in a Risdon
Iron Works launch. They were Harry
Holbrook, Cyrus R. Miller, U. S. N.; H.
Davis, Orrin Peck, Jack Wilson, Tom Mc-
Caleb, Allen Wallace, a grandson of Cor
nelius Vanderbilt; Judge McAllister, E.
M. Greenway and W. F. Goad.
With lunch aboard; the party started at
10 o'clock yesterday morning.
"Is there any one aboard who is a deep
sea sailor?" inquired Jack Wilson, sun
ning himself aft.
"Aye, aye, sir," came the answer from
Holbrook.
Then they all voted, but instead of
sticking the launch's nose through the
gate they steered straight for Mare Isl
and.
"It's such a pretty place to lunch," said
Peck, the artist.
Song, mirth, laughter and jokes beat
time with the thrum and throb of the gas
oline engine from San Francisco to Val
lejo. At Mare Island the Bohemians in
proper spirit walked through the grounds
and marveled at the big boats. They en
joyed it hugelyâ at least, so they told one
another. About 2 o'clock Greenway gath
ered the launchers together with the fol
lowing speech:
"Boys, we must be moving. This is
â winter and a storm may spring up at any
moment. Then, again, that awful fog "
That was enough. Visions of collisions
began to flitter through ten minds and
the entire party embarked for San Fran

trip. The sky looked bluer, the sea a
more restful green and the winter sun
never so warm.

Geary and Jones streets. Schwartz, who
is connected with the store, was down
in the basement when Gleason went
down to explain to him that he consid
ered he had the first call on the . young
lady's affections. This title was dis
puted by the man who has the privilege
of waiting on customers in the store,
and, not desiring to lose any valuable
time adjusting love matters, smote Glea
son on the head with a clawhammer.
Both men were taken away in- the patrol
wagon, Schwartz to be booked for an
assault with a deadlv weapon and Glea
son to have his cuts stitched at the
Emergency Hospital.

Greenway's fog was all a fear-born illu
sion, and they told him so. Out of San
Pablo Bay, through Racoon Straits, "the
jolly crew and the skipper, too," steamed
right into their own pleasure ground.
Then they got a puff of wind and a bit
of ruffled sea. Goad thought -he must
have eaten something that did not just
suit his stomach. Peck said he knew
that ecrevisse was bad to sail on. Wal
lace, who has sailed the deep Atlantic in
Cornelius' yachts, laughed and puffed
away at a two-bitter, satisfied with the
sea, the sky, the lunch and the company.
It was at this stage that the launch
steered for the Presidio shore. Holbrook
was stationed on the starboard bow â¢ to
look out for signs and countersigns. By
a piece of reckless daring the skipper tooh
them right in the wake of a passing tug
boat. Up in the air went launch and pas
sengers; down in the sea they came with
a churning roll.
"It was a terrible, tremendous affair,"
said Peck.
And here Harry Holbrook, feeling sad,
lonely and uneasy; parted company from
the starboard side of the launch.
Holbrook's overcoat saved him. It
spread out on the water and inflated like
a balloon. Two minutes elapsed before
Miller reached him. Then Davis sought
the main and the rescue followed by the
other launching party. Davis is looked
upon as the heroâ he couldn't swim, yet
he jumped in to save a friend in distress.
"If we hadn't held fast to Wilson," was
told In confidence In the Bohemian Club
last night, "it would have been a terrible
affair. But really and honestly, now that
it is all over we are as jolly fellows aa
ever we were."

Fate of Party of Pour
Utah Prospectors Is
Learned.
WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, Utah.
Dec. 8.â The fate of George Hayes and a
party of three prospectors, who left here
to prospect in the Philippines in 1899, has
been revealed in a letter just received in
this city. The party has been missing
since March, 1900, and every effort to lo
cate the miners had been futile.
Rev. C. J. Lenhart, formerly a minister
in Hawaii -and now residing at Manila,
was induced by friends of the missing
men to take up the search. Diligent In
quiry on his part disclosed the fact that
the party, disregarding the warnings of
the military not to venture beyond its
lines of defense, had gone into the moun
tains of Central Luzon. Later the bodies
of the four men were - found, literally
chopped to pieces by bolomen. The heads
chopped to pieces . by bolomen.

FITCH'S COMEDY
WILDLY WESTERN
"The Cowboy and the
Lady " Most Admira
bly Realistic.
Good Bills Are Presented at
All the Local Play
houses.
The usual blood-and-thunder "West,"
punctuated with pistols, perfumed with
cocktails and hustling its way through
ranch, dance-hall and courthouse, is the
"West" that has got into Clyde Fitch's
comedy-melodrama, "The Cowboy and
the Lady," that is the week's bill at the
California. The atmosphere is admirably
realistic and the very competent com
pany that S. Miller I^ent brings with him
is fully up to the mark in maintaining it.
There is not a failure throughout the
cast. "The staging is picturesque in the
extreme, and the drama compels enjoy
ment from its first word to the final cur
tain.
S. Miller Kent is the cowboy hero, but
does not get all, though he gets a. deal,
of what there is in the part. He is heavy
handed in the comedy, but handles the
tragedy with conviction and has a neat
touch in sentiment. Miss Ethelyn Pal
mer, who essays the "Lady's" part, also
lacks lightness in the comedy. Through
the lack her first scene, where she has to
make somewhat gratuitous fun of the
cowboyâ also an amateur cocktailâbe
comes almost what the purists call vulgar
and their enemies "tough," and her right
about-face to the fine lady of the. second
act rather puzzles in consequence. But
she is powerful and convincing on the
emotional side. Clever sketches, excel
lent sketches, are done by Rapley Holmes,
Bert Merkert, Joseph Williams as cow
boys; Weston, the villain, is well "acted
by Ralph Yoerg; Benjamin Bradbury
smudges in an Indian without much ben
efit to the picture; Charles J. Burbridge
and Frederick Malcolm are a Judge and
attorney with point and conviction.
The women without exception are good.
Blanche Rice is a young girl who plays
Midge with naive and attractive youth
fulness; Annie "Wood is a hilariously
funny Miss Prissims, and Molly Larkins,
the dance hall proprietress, is cleverly
done by Mathilde Weffing.
At the Columbia Theater to-night Jef
ferson de Angelis will appear In the oper
atic novelty, "A Royal Kogue." From all
accounts it is a good production and De
Angelis comes here surrounded . by a
strong company, including Henry Nor
man, Miss Helen Byron, Miss Adella Bar
ker, Charles Dungan, Edmund Lawrence,
John Dudley. Mite Gertrude Mackenzie.
Frank Kelly. Miss Adine Bouvier, Miss
Emily Francis and Miss Maud Poole. "A
Royal Rogue" was written by Charles
Klein of "El Capitan" fame, and the mu
sic is by William T. Francis. The produc
tion to be seen here is the same that won
favor at the New York Broaway Theater.
Some rich and effective costuming is
promised.
â¢ â¢ â¢
To-night, at the Grand Opera-house,
"The Crust of Society" will give way to
"A Wife's Peril," the second play of the
Minnie Seligman engagement. Miss Selig
man has the role in Sardou's drama that
was made famous by Lily Langtry and
should find It a congenial one.
Next Friday afternoon, at the Grand
Opera-house, the first concert of the sym
phony series that is to be given under the
auspices of the San Francisco Symphony
Society will take place at 1:15 sharp. The
orchestra of fifty-five members is under
the direction of Paul Steindorff, with
GIullo Minetti as concertmeister. A va
ried and Interesting programme has been
arranged and everything points to the se
ries being an artistic and financial suc
cess. The sale of single seats begins in
the morning, with prices at $150, $1, 75
cents and 50 cents.
"Christopher Jr.," a successful comedy,
will, be the Alcazar bill this week. It is
said to call for almost the full strength
of the Alcazar Stock Company, at present
one of the strongest stock organizations
in any popular house. "The Gay Mr.
Lightfoot" is announced for next week.
Another sensational mechanical melo
drama will be put on at the Central Thea
ter to-night. Charles E. Blarney's "The
Electrician." One of the features of the
melodrama Is a power-house In full work
ing operation, and the balance of the
piece will have the good staging that is
generally to be seen at the Central. The
competent company will be appropriately
cast and the exciting incidents of the play
should suffice to keep the patrons of the
house interested for an evening.
The new bill which opens at The Chutes
to-day includes Rawson's famous animal
actors, consisting of dogs, ponies and
goats; Brady and Hamilton, Irish comedy
duo; Ellis and Bowman, vocalists; The
Lockos, bag punchers, and Leando broth
ers, comedy acrobats. A series of new
moving pictures will also be shown.
One of the best bills ever presented at
the Orpheum was given last night. The
appearance of J. Sherrie Matthews, for
merly of Matthews and Bulger, assisted
by Norma Whalley, Sam Marion and W.
H. McCart. was decidedly the feature of
the evening and is one of the best vaude
ville turns ever seen on the coast. Their
musical skit, "A Lawless Lawyer," cap
tivated the audience. Mr. Matthews and
Mr. McCart made a pronounced hit with
a clever parody on "When Shakespeare
Comes to Town." Sam Marion, a Cali
fornia boy, got a splendid reception. He
is a graceful dancer. La Belle Tortajada
in Spanish songs and dances Is the best
representative of such specialties that
ever crossed the ocean. The Dumond Pa
risian Minstrels, a trio of whimsical com
edians, are comedians and musicians of
great merit. Flo Irwin and Walter Haw
ley in their humorous conceit. "Caugnt
With the Goods," give a thoroughly en
tertaining and polished act. Werden and
Shtperd, illustrated song vocalists, scored
an immense success. The stereoptlcon
pictures used to illustrate a series of well
selected and well sung songs surpasses
anything In this line seen at the Orpheum.
Other worthy features of the bill are
Fred Niblo, the monologist, and the Fra
zer troupe, international dancers.
Charity Martin, the favorite soprano,
will be heard in new solos at Fischer's
Concert-house this week and she will also
sing duets with the favorite tenor, John
Desmond. The Mullaly sisters, novelty
singers and dancers, will make their first
appearance here, as will also Demine and
Carrol, clever sketch artists. Charles
Barrtngton promises a unique act, an<l
Satuella, a wonderful contortionist, will
reappear. Blanche Reynolds changes her
trombone solos, Kalacratus, equilibrist
and hoop roller, will appear, and Hin
richs' excellent orchestra will present a
varied programme. â¢
To-night the Pollard Australian Juve
nile Opera company will begin the last
week of Its engagement at the Tlvoli.
The clever children will be heard this
week in a new musical comedy, "In
Town," to be given for the first time here.
It is said to be bright and snappy and
with all the tuneful music necessary to
the success of its kind. The Pollard "kid
dles" must be seen to be believed and will
doubtless find in "In Town" another op
portunity to show what can be done by
children who cannot only sing, but dance,
and not only dance and sing, but act in
a fashion to shame all but the best of
their elders in the same game.
Immense Bankrupt Sale of Clothing

est Bankrupt Clothing Sale that will take
place on Thursday, at 9 a. m., at the Bos
