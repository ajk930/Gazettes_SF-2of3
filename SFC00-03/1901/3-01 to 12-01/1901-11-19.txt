QREAT FALLS, Mont.. Nov. IS.â
Eighteen bruised and bloody,
maimed and moaning Japanese
were unloaded from a boxcar
here this afternoon, tenderly
placed on cots, on wagons and in hacks ,
and taken to Columbus Hospital for i
treatment. Ten other Japanese are dead
and ten with slight wounds are at Glas- j

collision yesterday on the Great North- i

Forty-one Japanese were riding in a '

was at the forward end of a work train, j

A srreat crowd assembled here when the
train arrived. The car containing the
men was switched to a side track. When
the doors were opened the sight was a
horrible one â the men, swathed roughly
in bandages, lying about the floor, upon
cots anÃ blankets. Some had broken arms
and leers, others horrible burns and tears
of the flesh. The side of one man's right
thigh was burned away, while another's
right hand was burned to a crisp and in
his eyes was the look of death.

One of the uninjured Japanese, who
could talk English, said:
"I was thrown out of the car and nar

Some men were literally torn to pieces

Then the fire came and we had to stand
and see some men burned before our eyes
because we could not give help to them."

SOFIA, Nov. 18.-Anoth.er letter has
been received from Ellen M. Stone.
Her health has been somewhat affected
by her continuous confinement and hard
fare, but she expresses herself as still
confident of ultimate release.
A letter to Mr. Dickinson, diplomatic
agent of the United fetates at Sofia, re
plying to his proposals concerning a ran
som, says the brigands will hold out for
a figure very much above the sum at Mr.
Dickinson's command. The brigands also
demand immunity from prosecution, but
it is impossible for the diplomatic agent
of the United States here to have power
to bind the Governmtnts of Bulgaria and
Turkey. This ,x>int, however, is not likely
to be a serious obstacle in the way of ne

OF PRESIDENT McKINLEY
Federal Government Will Place it on
Exhibition at the Smithsonian
Institution.
BUFFALO. N. V., Nov. IS.â After two
months' work a cast from the death
mask of the late President McKinley,
done on the morning of his death, was fin
ished to-day. The mask has been care
fully guarded, being kept in a safety de
posit vault Â¦when not in the hands of Ed
ward Lapouch, an expert mask maker
from Hartford, Conn. The mask is the
property of the Federal Government. Next
week it will be taken to Washington,
where for a time it will be shown to the
public at the Smithsonian Institution.
It was the express order of the Govern
ment that no photograph of the mask
should be taken. It is said to be one of
the most perfect ever taken of a notable
person. The mask differs from those of
Napoleon or others in that, instead of
merely including the face, it portrays
practically the entire head. The plaster
itself weighs twenty-live pounds.

to his sister Florence for the purpose of
defrauding him. Miss Sylva claims to
have bought the property with her own
money.
In to-day's action Judge Angellotti fur
ther ordered that on the first of each
month Thomas Frost, the other owner in
the plant, shall deposit with the treasurer
one-half of the profits of the business.
This action Is taken pending the final
adjudication of the case.
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1901.
HAY AND PAUNCEFOTE SIGN NEW
TREATY GIVING AMERICA RIGHT
TO CONTROL AND DEFEND CANAL
Convention Is Similar to That of Last Year, but Is Made to Include
All of the Amendments Favored by the United
States Senate*
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â The
new Hay-Pauncefote treaty
was signed at the State De
partment to-day. Lord
Pauncefote appeared at the
State Department at 12 o'clock and ex
pressed a desire to sign the treaty to-day.
as he had been suffering from gout and
did not know when he would be able to
visit the department again. The treaty
was signed by the Secretary of State and
the British Embassador in the presence
of Percy Wyndham, second secretary to
the British Embassy; Sidney Smith,
chief of the Diplomatic Bureau, and two
messengers of the State Department.
The text of the new treaty will not be
made public until subrnitteu to the Sen
ate and the injunction of secrecy has
been removed by that body. There have
been attempts to give the full text, but
they are merely based on the old treaty,
with the changes suggested by the Senate
amendments.
Treaty Satisfies Senators.
Several Senators and representative
members of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee have seen the new treaty.
They are satisfied with it and
confident it will meet the ap
proval of the Senate and the country.
The forecasts that have been published
are in the main correct. ' There has been
no effort to write a new treaty, but to
put into compact form the provisions of
ihe treaty of last year as amended by
the Senate. Great Britain would not ac
cept the Senate amendments, but was not
opposed to negotiating a new treaty
which would provide for substantially
the same things.
The substance of the new convention is
that the old Clayton-Bulwer treaty is
superseded by one that provides an isth
mian canal, constructed under the
auspices of the United States Govern
ment, either directly at Its own cost or
in other ways, and this Government en
joys all rights incident to such construc
tion, as well as the exclusive right of
providing for the regulation and manage
ment of the canal. This Government
alone shall guarantee the neutrality of
the canal and the rules incorporated in
the treaty of last year are so modified
as to conform to such guarantee. Other
powers are not invited to participate in,
this guarantee, but It Is provided that
those, powers observing the neutrality ad
guaranteed by the United States shall en
joy the same privileges without discrim
ination in tonnage dues, etc.
America May Fortify Canal.
The prohibition of fortifications does not
appear in the new treaty. There is no
mention of fortifications, but the United
States is conceded the right to protect
the canal.
These are substantially the principal
provisions of the new treaty. Secretary
I Hay and Lord Pauncefote have endeav
ored to write a treaty that would em
body all that was in their foÂ£sii?r treaty
after it was amended by the Senate and
make the whole a diplomatic agreement
between the two great English-speaking
powers. They have smoothed out some
of the expressions of the Senate amend
ments to make them harmonize with the
body of the treaty, or to write a conven
tion that will present the same conditions
and remove all friction.
Senators who have read the new treaty
are satisfied that it meets all the objec
tions raised against the treaty of last
year and leaves nothing undone to cause
the Senate to hesitate in ratification.
Unanimously for Nicaraguan Route.
Admiral Walker was at the State De
partment soon after Embassador Paunce-

fote left and had a conference with Sec
retary Hay. The report of the canal com
mission is ready, but is withheld for a few
days to make a few slight changes in the
final recommendations. It will be deliv
ered to the Secretary during the week
and the President will transmit it to
Congress In the first week of the session.
The committee has reached a unanimous
agreement upon all important points, and,
it is said, has again recommended the
Nicaragua route for the canal.
It Is predicted the new treaty will be
ratified before the holiday recess, and
there will be a canal bill introduced at
the beginning of the session.
BRITONS ARE COMPLACENT.
Signing of Treaty Arouses Little In
terest in London.
LONDON, Nov. 18.â Except as affording
a chance for the opposition journals to
"attack the Go /eminent and the Foreign
Secretary, Lord Lansdowne. the signing
of the new isthmian canal convention
does not excite strong interest in Great
Britain. It is generally admitted that the
British have nothing to gain by a reten
tion of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, while
they have much to gain by the construc
tion of the canal.
The Morning' Post congratulates both
countries on the completion of the treaty,
and says it is glad thii the convention of
1900 has been revised :n accordance with
American wishes. The Daily Mail fears
that the signing may not terminate for
ever a troublesome dispute, and believes
Canada ought to receive some equivalent
for the concessions which probably have
been made.
The Daily Chronicle says: "Lord Lans
downe has surrendered everything with
out compensation. Tne Government has
climbed down from the position it had
deliberately chosen, and although the
dlsappearnce of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty will not cause much regret many
people will sigh for tli3 'business Cabinet'
which Lord Rosebery if cently suggested."
In conclusion the Daily Chronicle char
acterizes the new treaty as a "full ac
ceptance by Great Britain of the Monroe
doctrine," and says:
"It would be strange, Indeed, if the Sen

Special Dispatch to The Call.
y*^ALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
/f N. W., WASHINGTON, Nov.
V Jl 18.â Friends of the President now
e*xpect a conflict between the ex
ecutive branch of the Govern
ment and the Senate unless the present
drift is changed. There are experienced
observers in Washington who say that a
conflict cannot be avoided.
One source of the trouble, as announced
In The Call yesterday, may be the selec
tion of a chairman of the Senate Com
mittee on Foreign Relations, made vacant
by the death of Senator Cushman K.
Davis. The rumor that the President is
urging the candidacy of Senator Lodge,
despite the fact that Senator Cullom of
Illinois is entitled to the place by right
of seniority, will not down. S.hould the
President take a hand in the contest for
this chairmanship he will stir up a tre
mendous storm in the Senate, which re
gards as sacred the right to manage its
own affairs â a right with which no Presi
dent has ever heretofore sought to inter
fere.
But the principal bone of contention is
the appointments which the President
will have to make to vacant brigadier
generalships in the regular army and
army promotions in general. Other ap
pointments may be dragged in and fur
nish fuel to the fire.
Blow at Politicians.
Secretary Root, at the request of the
President, served notice on the politicians
on last Saturday that no requests made
by them regarding army appointments
would be considered by him. and that im
portunities made by members of Con

prejudicing the cases of those they were

VIOTIM OF BABY MINE
DISASTER RESCUED ALIVE
Searching Party Finds Him En
tombed in a Side Room Off the
Burning Shaft. *
POCAHONTAS. Va., Nov. IS.-The work
of removing fallen slate and debris from
the Baby mine continues. This morning
Fritz Moulter was found entombed in a
room on the west side. He* was living,
but a few hours more would no doubt
have brought death. For six hours phy
sicians worked over him before he was
restored to consciousness. He is yet fee
ble but will likely recover. There was
great rejoicing when the news spread that
he had been recovered alive*. Moulter
says that all within the mine Thursday
night commented on the heaviness of the
atmosphere, and that a number of the
men left their work ahead of him. He
soon found that danger was imminent and
along with several others started run
ning from the drift. A heavy report that
shook the mountain was heard, and an
instant later a huge cloud of smoke and
flame was seen coming. He lost sight of
his companions, but he turned into a side
room as quickly as possible and was shut
off by falling slate. Probably two days
passed before he succumbed to the foul
air.

LONDON, Nov. 18.â The Times says.
"It is premature to assume that all diffi

designed to help. The plain intimation
was made that the President regarded
these importunities as annoying, and the
announcement was made that nothing
would count but the records of the men
under consideration.
Some of the Senators who did not be
lieve that the views of the President had
been represented accurately, determined
to make a test. They called and urged
the claims of friends for vacant and cov
eted promotions to brigadier generalships.
The President instantly told them that It
was useless for them to make any rec
ommendations, because he would go by
the merit record, and should any Senator
or Representative urge the claims of any
particular candidate it would Injure his
chances for consideration. The state
ment was made so emphatically that the
Senators have felt indignant and are do
ing much talking to the effect that the
President is Infringing on the rights of
the Senate, because appointments are to
be made "by and with the advice of Sen
ators."
The position of the President and Secre
tary Root is that all army officers should
be taken out of politics, and the way to
do it is to adhere strictly to the records
in making promotions. In other words*
the President is determined that the rule
of favoritism in the army shall cease and
officers deserving of promotion shall not
be denied because some one else less de
serving has the influence of a few Sen
ators.
Stories of a Senatorial combination to
"hold up" all of the President" s nomina
tions until he recedes from his present
stand are already heard, and no one
doubts that the early part of the session
will see an attempted revolt against the
President like that which made Mr.
Cleveland's second term memorable.

Attractive Programmes Presented at Tivoli, Alcazar and Central Theaters, While
California, Orpheum and Columbia Repeat Offerings Successfully.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
WHEN "Manon Lescaut" was
chosen for Syfcil Sanderson's de
but before a San Francisco au
dience last Saturday evening at
the Grand Opera-house it was
presumably because the role was the best
thing in her repertoire. She had sung
it numberless times. It was written for
her. She had been trained to its possi
bilities by the composer himself and had
achieved a huge success in Paris and Jt.
Petersburg in the role, as we heard here
from time to time. Naturally it was im
agined from these things that "Manon"
was Miss Sanderson's best work. It was
that in which she won her fame and it
was that which was chosen to exhibit
her here to her expectant compatriots.
Just the same, it was a mistake, and a
big one.
The thin, finicky elegance of the opera
came with absurd effect after "Die
Walkure" of the evening before, and the
melodiou# splendors of "Faust" in the
afternoon to begin with. Its light insin
cerity of theme, aptly fitted to equally
emasculate musical setting, jarred imme
diately on the ear keyed up to grand
opera pitch.
it was as if one had been given the frills
round a fruit cake to devour instead of
the comfortable richness of the cake it
self, and the suggestion carried Itself out
THE SAN TKANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, . NOVEMBER 19, 15)01.
as far as Miss Sanderson herself was con- \
cerned. But she was not at her best on
Saturday night, not by much, as her work
last night in "Romeo and Juliet" showed.
She was evidently more seriously affected
by nervousness than was at all apparent,
The voice suffered seriously through it,
and, combined with the thinness of the
opera, the conditions were liberally ' un
favorable to a success of any kind.
It was different last night. "Komeo and
Juliet," though not a great opera, is
at least worthy, and in parts strikingly
beautiful. Miss Sanderson had something
to sing and one of the beautiful world
roles to play, and her Juliet is another
story from the "Manon." Not that Miss
Handerson is a great singer; she has no
quality of greatness; but her voice at its
best, as heard last night, is a high, light
soprano of sweet, though uncertain qual-'
ity, flexible and well cultivated. But it
is worn and only safely used in the lighter
voice, the loss of quality being immedi
ately apparent when the singer attempts
anything fuller than a mezzo voce.
But she sang the "Waltz" song with a
good deal of charm, and throughout
showed a vocal competency that gives her
a place with singers not of the first rank,
but with others that come a quite respec
table second. She enunciates beautifully,
every word being clearly distinguishable
all over the house.
As to Miss Sanderson's dramatic con
ception of the role, it is by far the most
satisfying I have seen. It Is very French,
unusually animated, but full of charm,
tenderness and girlish tfrace.
She is a beautiful creature and quite
worth the money to look at, but she acts
the part, too, and is the only singer I
have heard who put the tenor in the
shade from the standpoint of dramatic
interest. Melba, as Juliet, created only
the most languid enthusiasm here in
spite of her marvelous vocal gifts, but
Miss Sanderson last night roused the
house to a genuine enthusiasm for the
role and the singer, and just by virtue of
the truth and poetry of her conception.
Of the others Salignac was the Romeo,
and . added appreciably to his laurels
thereby. He a little over-acts the part,
but It Is so frequently under-acted that
the other thing comes as a distinct relief
Barring a tendency to sing off key occa
sionally, the tenor was in good voice, and
was much enjoyed by his audience. De
Reszke was Friar Laurent last night, and
was superbly sufficient In the part. His
massive voice was In splendid order and
there was only De Reszke on the stage as
long as he was singing.
Mr. Declery was a weak Mercutlo, with
possibilities, however; Mr. Bars was a
sufficient Tybalt, and Mr. Journet was a
dignified and artistic figure as Capulet.
Miss Bridewell received a pleasant meed
of applause as Stephano, and Miss Bauer
meister, always reliable, filled in the pic
ture adequately as Gertrude. Mr. Flon
conducted with considerable eclat.
To-night Eames, Sembrich and "Le
Nozze di Figaro" will be the attraction.
SYBIL SANDERSON TRIUMPHS.
Society Does Not Witness Singer's
Second Appearance.
Sybil Sanderson scored a distinct suc
cess last night when she sang the role of
Juliet in Gounod's opera of "Romeo et
Juliette" at the Grand Opera-house.
If Manager Grau had Introduced the
California singer on Saturday night in the
part she sang last night instead of in that
of "Manon" there would have been a far
different story to tell of the audience that
assembled last evening to listen to the
grand opera singers.
The attendance was not bad, but it was
not good and the boxes and many rows of
Beats in orchestra and dress circle were
unoccupied. There was no elegant dis
play or evening dress by the ladies pres
ent and the "between act talks" of what
"Mrs. So and So wore" or how Miss Blank
looked were not heard in the foyer.
The mysterious air that dominates a
"society night" was not there, but despite
the difference in the slxe of the audience
from the one that greeted Sybil Sanderson
on Saturday evening the fair singer "made
good." The gorgeous gown worn by Miss
Sanderson In the first act of the opera
was. without doubt, the finest specimen
of the dressmaker's art ever seen in this
city. It was of pale pink heavy brocaded
silk, embroidered wKh pearls and pearl
trimmings and was the envy of all the
women in the audience. The music of
Gounod's opera seemed to bring out all
the qualities of Miss Sanderson's voice,
and while none of the audience designated
her as a "great singer" all were unani
mous in declaring that she was an ideal
Juliette and great applause was' lavished
on the California artist.
After each act Miss Sanderson was

called to the footlights many times and
she was undoubtedly pleased with her re
ception, for she fairly beamed with de
light. De Reszke, Bauermeister, Bars,
Journet, Declery and Salignac were also
recipients of considerable applause.
Manager Grau listened to the opera last
night and when he discussed the reception
accorded Miss Sanderson and compared it
with the comments made when she sang
"Manon," he shrugged his shoulders.
Grau and his business staff naturally be
lieved that Sybil Sanderson would have
appeared at her best In the opera of
"Manon," with which she Is identified, as
Calve Is with "Carmen" and Tamagno
with "Otello."
Catering to the public, from a grand
opera manager's view, Is a risky business.
Sanderson made her "hit" last night and,
with Grau, she Is satisfied.
To-night Madames Barnes and Sembrich
are to be heard in "Le Nozze di Figaro,"
with De Reszke, Campanari and Fritzl
Scheff in the cast. The house is sold out
and society Is likely to make a brilliant
display.

Orpheum.
The show at the Orpheum this week Is
replete with numbers that one would
travel a long distance to see or hear.
"The Girl With the Auburn Hair" is such

a clever one and has proyen such an at
traction that It is doubtful whether the
patrons of the Orpheum will be satisfied
to see her leave. Lillian Burkhardt is ex
ceptionally clever in the playlet she is
presenting this week, and the Fraser
troupe of international dancers are terp
sichorean experts. Adelman's xylophone
solos are still popular and the funny
stories of Nlblo are fetching. Bicknell,
the man with the do^gh and the nimble
fingers, is a hit. In addition to his digital
cleverness he is a humorist and keeps the
audience laughing heartily with his re
marks. Ward and Curran are a good
team and the Kaufmann family literally
paralyze the audience with the skill they
display In manipulating the bicycle.
Central.
With Its local surroundings, its familiar
Chinatown quarter and the still more fa
miliar bluecoats, "The King of the Opium
Ring" at Belasco & Thall's Central Thea
ter opened last evening to a crowded
house. An enthusiastic audience Inhaled
the pungent odor of the punk without
murmur of protest and vigorously ap
plauded the daring feats exhibited In
every moment of the play. The produc
tion was a very heavy one and the per
fect reproduction of the well-known por
tions of Chinatown won frequent ap
plause.
Hallett Thompson as the officer of the
law had the sympathy of the house, who
urged him on to his many deeds of dar
ing. Misses Annette Marshall and Pen
nock as the much-sought sisters, were
strong In their respective roles, and fre
quent hisses attested to what a capable
villain Stanley Ross, as the "King of the
Opium Ring," can be.
James Corrlgan as Wah Wing, high
binder, added to his many character hits,
as did George Hernandez as the black
chink. The balance of the cast was well
sustained, and as a first night perform-,
ance "The King of the Opium Ring" is
among the best things the Central has
yet presented. "Siberia" Is announced for
Thanksgiving week, with a special mati
nee on Thanksgiving day.
California.
Haverly's Minstrels played to another
jammed house at the California last
night. The big audience heard the new
jokes and songs of some of the cleverest
black face performers in America. There
aro some fine soloists in the company and
the end men are very funny. The min
strels will play at the California all the
week.
Columbia.
Comedy was never presented here be
fore with such careful attention to scenic
effects and such picturesque art as is wit
nessed at the Columbia this week in Au
gustus Thomas' comedy "On the Quiet."
The name fits the play well, for it is
unusually quiet, and were it not that it is
scened to perfection and presented by a
company in which there are no misfits, it
would steer dangerously near to the rocks
and shoals of disappointment. But in
such capable hands it is an enjoyable
performance, remarkably free from horst.

a charm of freshness and naturalness sel
dom seen in these conventional days and
the recalls with which she and Mr. Col
lier were favored last night were ex-
tended with an enthusiasm and warm
heartedness that must have been highly
gratifying to the clever actress.
Alcazar.
"Self and Lady" was given the hearti
est kind of a reception by a large audi
ence at the Alcazar last night. The play
is a farce comedy revised from the
French and is replete with laughable
features. The plot, if plot 4here is, is
rendered rather hazy by a succession of
amusing situations without any very clear
connection with each other. A notary,
in the absence of a star singer, takes
the part of Faust in the opera and makes
a decided hit. His. wife, unaware that the
new character is her husband, falls in
love with him and sends him a note giv
ing a rendezvous. He" restolves to deceive
his wife for once and meet the strange
lady. His friend, his friend's wife and
tne opera star and his wife all make sim
ilar decisions as regards each other. All
meet at a popular hotel and complica
tions ensue which draw forth continued
and well merited applause. Miss Juliet
Crosby, as the wife of the genuine singer
received an ovation. Her work is really
superb and deserving of the emphatic
indorsement which it received. Marion
Convere and Margaret Wycherly were
also very clever. M. L. Alsop and Frank
Bacon are old favorites and are as amus
ing as ever.
Fischer's Concert-House.
Eleanors Jenkins, the operatic rocallst.
scored a great success In the disrobing
scene from "Fra Dlavolo" at Fischer's
Concert House last night. Her "Zerlina"
was a well-sung and refined Impersona
tion. The Lentons, three comedians, acro
bats and hat-throwers, gave a novel
sketch. "After the Ball," and Edna Ham
ln, who made her first appearance here
was warmly applauded for her soprano so
los. Marlon George, a young violinist
played with feeling and showed an excel
lent technique. Gertrude Wade, a pleas-
Ing balladlst. sang some new songs and
the Blalne Brothers, herculean acrobats
gave an extraordinary muscular exhlbi'
tion. Karle and Bailey, triple horizontal
bar experts, repeated their performance
of last week and Hlnrichs" orchestra waa
enjoyable as ever.

The triaV of the suit for divorce insti
tuted by Addie M. Sorensen against Wil
liam Sorensen for desertion and failure
to provide was commenced before Judge
Sloss yesterday. The Sorensens were
married in 1889 and their children, of
whom there are three, were mein-^
bera of S. H. Friedlander's "Brownie*^
Company, and Mrs. Sorensen claims?
that she was compelled to depanJ
upon them for support. Sorensen denies â
this, though he admits that from the time
he left his wife, in June. 1898. when he
went to Nome, until he returned in 1900,
he only sent her a few groceries and $10.
Sorensen claims that when he went to
Alaska he arranged with his 90ns by a
former marriage to care for his wife and
family. According to Mrs. Sorensen. the
arrangements were not carried out, arul
one month after her husband went north
she was compelled to depend upon the
exertions of herself and the three little
ones for a livelihood. The case was con
tinued.

A cockade of red, white and blue is the
most noticeable feature of the New White
House livery, although the national colors
are In evidence throughout the costume
In which the President's coachman and
footman appear.
The coats and the* trousers are of heavy
dark blue vicuna, the best quality of
goods obtainable being used. The outer
seams of the trousers are bound with a
white cord.
The long paddock driving coat, which
terminates midway between knee and
ankle. Is of "military" cut and has a snug
waist and broad, square shoulders. The
skirt has a decided flare. Down the front
from the tight-fitting narrow collar to the
waist line, run parallel lines of silver but
tons.
Underneath the coat Is worn a long
sleeved tunic of the same material as the
other garments and fastened in front by
a single row of silver buttons.
Mrs. Roosevelt selected the material
and the pattern for the livery. The or
der was given to a fashionable New York
livery tailor.
Henry Perrln, the President's coach
man, jind Reeder, the footman, were
highly elated when, clad for the first
time in their new livery, they mounted
the box of the smart new surrey and
took Mrs. Roosevelt and Miss Alice
Roosevelt for a drive.
President Roosevelt's aversion to horses
with docked tails is making it difficult
for his stable manager to find a suitable
team of bay geldings for White House

found.

The table wai weighted down with the fam

oblong mirror framed with silver, on which
rested a magnificent silver vase filled with
chrysanthemums. There were two other vases
of these flowers in pink; yellow and white, ar
ranged among the tall candelabra, at the base
of which were silver comports of hothouse
fruits, bonbons and cakes, carrying out the
color scheme of the flowers.
These comports, with high covered silver
dishes, circled the entire table.

There Is a grand display of chrysanthe
mums in Miss Helen Gould's greenhouse
at Lyndhurst-on-Hudson.
Miss Gould's nursery is probably the
largest in that vicinity, and recently her
superintendent, Ferdinand Mangold, sent
a notice to a local paper that more than
2000 chrysanthemums were In bloom and
the public was invited to see the display.
Miss Gould, who is now at her Fifth ave
nue residence, will make a special trip
to Tarrytown to see the plants in bloom.
The chrysanthemums are of all varie
ties and colors. Hundreds are visiting
the greenhouses daily.

Slow progress is being made with the
new house of the Duke and Duchess of
Marlborough in London and it Is said that
the Duchess is exceedingly reluctant to
proceed any further with the building,
and that many of her differences with her
husband are due to his obstinacy in de
clining to consider her wishes in the mat
ter.
There is ample grounds for her fears.
For, in the first place a sort of blight
seems to attach itself to those who build
on sites which have been formerly con
secrated to the use of the church â the
Duke having razed Curzon Chapel to
make way for hia new mansion â and
then, too, a species of 111 luck seems to
follow all those who build new large
mansions In London. The ruin of Hud
son, the railroad king, of "Baron" Grant,
of "Colonel" North, of the late Lord
Revelstoke nnd of the late Senor Mur
rietta, Marquis of Santurce, followed
immediately the completion of their new
town mansions In London. Lord Rose
bery's administration collapsed as soon
as ever he finished his house in Berkeley
Square, while Barney Barnato committed
suicide before the" completion of his house
In Park Lane.

The Hope diamond, so called from the
fact that for seventy years It has been
in the possession of the English family
of which Lorfl Francis Hope is a mem
ber, was purchased from the latter In
London recently by Simon Frankel of 68
Nassau street. New York City. The sale
of the famous gem was made through
Adolph Weil of London, who carried on
negotiations with representatives of Lord
Francis Hope on behalf of Frankel. The
members of the Frankel firm were not
willing to give the figure at which they
obtained the gem, but cable dispatches
from London said that it was $250,000.
According to Mr. Frankel, the negotia
tions which have led to the sale of the
gem by the Hope family were begun about
five months ago. Lord Francis Hope,
who got the diamond as an Inheritance
from his mother, to whom it had been
left by her father, Henry T. Hope, a well
known banker of Amsterdam, was then
on the verge of bankruptcy. The Frank
els heard of this and through intermedi
aries made an offer for the famous blue
diamond, which Lord Francis Hope was
considering, when the negotiations were
suddenly called off on account of the ob
jections of other members of the family.

their prison cell, under the direction of
Lawyer Semple, had procured a small

Magistrate's Intimate Knowledge
of Parliamentary Situation.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.-The Irish
Parliamentary leaders who are touring
this country agitating the Irish cause

knov. - n situation which he
displayed. After greetings had been f-x
changed on both sidos and the President

HEARS OPINIONS
ON RECIPROCITY
Lawmakers and Manu
facturers Talk to the
President.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â The Presi
dent's time to-day was largely taken up
in the discussion of reciprocity. Senator
Cullom of Illinois and Representative
Dalzell of Pennsylvania had something
to say to him on that subject, and a dele
gation of agricultural implement manu
facturers, consisting of James Deere of
Chicago, A. B. Farquhar of York, Pa.,
and W. V. Barker of New York, who are
here to attend the reciprocity convention,
which meets to-morrow, presented a me
morial strongly urging that something be
done. The delegation told the President
that in Its opinion the time for action had
come. Reciprocity had been talked and
preached about for years, and unless a
decisive step were taken now which
would effect the whole subject it might
as well be abandoned. The members of
the delegation said that they had no par
ticular interest in any of the treaties, but
thought, taken altogether, that the French
treaty more nearly represented the best
possibilities in the way of reciprocity, and
that if it could be ratified a distinct vic
tory would be won. Mr. Dalzell, who
talked with the President for almost a
half-hour, is hostile to all the reciprocity
treaties.
"The only reciprocity I favor," said he,
"is reciprocity on the basis of non-com
peting articles. The 20 per cent cut on
textile fabrics in the French treaty would
destroy the textile industries of Pennsyl
vania. While there is just now much talk
of reciprocity, in my opinion nothing will
be done during the coining session of Con
gress."
Representative Roberts of Massachu
setts, another of the President's callers
to-day, said there was a strong sentiment
for reciprocity in New England.
"But," said he, "we do not want the
sort of reciprocity that will open our mar
kets to foreign competitors and give us
nothing in return."
Mr. Roberts said that the leather men
of the country were organized to bring
about the removal of ihe duties on hides.
CHAFFEE WARMLY PRAISES

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.-General Chaf
fee has issued a general order highly
commending the conduct of a detachment
of the First Infantry which made a scout

to 25 last. Captain Harold L. Jackson
was in command of the detachment,
which consisted of First Lieutenatn Jo
pph W. Benham Jr., Contract Surgeon
C R. Ohlinger, forty-live enlisted men of
Company I, thirty-five of Company L and
thirty natives.
General Chaffee said that the report
shows that the enemy was twice encoun
tered and defeated, valuable papers cap
tured and chattels and supplies of the en
emy destroyed. Valuable information was
also gained. The energy and gallantry
displayed are highly commendable, and
the instance is placed on record as one of
the many feats of endurance and deter
mination shown by the troops of the com
mand.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1901.
GERMAN KAISER
ENJOYS DEBATE
Takes Part in Discussion
Before Body of Naval
Engineers.
BERLIN, Nov. 18.â Emperor William
participated In the debate of the Society
of Naval Engineers to-day on the subject
of placing heavy guns on battleships and
Its effect upon their construction. His
Majesty referred to the influence of mili
tary requirements upon the development of
ship construction and artillery, and point
ed out how the aim of Germany had al
ways been to allow the opinion of the of
ficers who had to navigate the ships to
have as much weight and influence as
possible on the shipbuilder and con
structor.
The Emperor, illustrating his contention
that tactical requirements influenced the
construction of ships of war, said the time
of the galleys had seen great develop
ments in the matter ot boat fire, and that
the galleys were superior in this respect
to later battleships. He instanced the bat
tle of Lepanto as the greatest wherein
galleys had been engaged, and said Don
Juan of Austria had brought his galleys
into action in half-moon formation and
had destroyed the enomy's fleet by 'the
superiority of their bow fire.
Germany was also the first nation able
to place a captain stil! on the active list
at the head of the construction bureau.
He believed that the type of vessels now
being launched in German yards repre
sented the very best needed for the pur
poses of the country or that could be de
manded from the splendid constructors
and magnificent yards of Germany.
Emperor William concluded his remarks
with the following anfcedote:
"Some fifteen or twenty years ago my
Interest in and my zeal for naval ques
tions led me to approach an old naval of
ficer and request of hfm an explanation
of the metacenter of a vessel. He an
swered that he himself did not exactly
know what this was, and, besides, it was
a secret. He could only tell me that If
the metacenter was in the main truck the
vessel would capsize."'

ment in England for Forging a
Railroad Certificate.
LONDON, Nov. 18.â Miss Marie Jose
phine Eastwick, the young Philadelphia
woman who was comvnitted October 1 in
the Guildhall Police Court for trial at
the Old Bailey on the charge: of having
forged a Â£100,000 railroad certificate, and
who on being arraigned pleaded guilty,
was sentenced thl^ morning to six
months' imprisonment as a second-class
misdemeanant.
The Recorder in sentencing Miss East
wick said he had received documents from
the United States en;l;assy showing the
accused was mentally weak, but he could
not accept that as a plea, the question of
sanity being a matter for the Secretary

FRENCH DEPUTY
RAISES A ROW
Favors Boxing the Ears
of OnÂ© of the Repub
lican Leaders.
PARIS, Nov. 18.â An uproarious inci
dent occurred to-day in the Chamber of
Deputies during the discussion of the bill
authorizing the loan of 250,000,000 francs in
3 per cent perpetual rentes to reimburse
the treasury for its outlay as a result of
the Chinese expedition and to pay in
demnities to French sufferers in China.
M. Hubbard reported that the Budget
Commission proposed to reduce the
amount of the loan to 210,000,000 francs,
because objection was taken to the propo
sition that France snould advance in
demnities to the religious associations
and financial enterprises. M. Hubbard'a
report was extremely anti-clerical.
M. Rlbot, Republican, replied to M.
Hubbard, protesting against the report,
which he declared shameful, whereupon
M. Berteaux, Socialist, exclaimed that M.
Ribot deserved to have his ears boxed.
At this the Centrists vehemently protest
ed, while the Socialists cheered.
Amid the din M. Dtschanel, President
of the Chamber, called upon M. Berteaux
to withdraw. This M. Berteaux refused
to do, and renewed outcries and banging
of desks resulted. M. Deschanel contin
ued to ring his bell until the noise was
quieted, when he asked the Chamber to
censure M. Borteaux. This was voted. M.
Ribot then resumed his reply to M. Hub
bard's report, but the Socialists recom
menced their noisy opposition, to which
the Centrists responded equally loud, un
til the uproar became so deafening that
M. Deschanel left the chair and the ses
sion was suspended.
Subsequently the session was resumed,
and M. Ribot continued his speech. The
Chamber then adjourned.

MAY PROSECUTE
THE PHYSICIANS
St. Louis Health Depart
ment Guilty of Neg
ligence.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 18.â Coroner Funk
houser to-day rendered a verdict finding
the St. Louis Health Department negli
gent in the preparation of diphtheria anti
toxlne that caused the deaths by lock
jaw (tetanus) of seven children to whom
it was recently administered for diph
theria.
The verdict, in part, Is as follows:
We find that the deceased came to their
death from tetanus, following: the administra
tion of diphtheria antl-toxlne containing
tetanus toxine, said diphtheria antl-toxine hav
ing been prepared and issued by the Health
Department of the city of St. Louis and bear
ing dates on tables of August 24 and September
30, 1901.
The presence of tetanus toxine In the diph
theria antl-toxine shows negligence upon the
part of the Health Department in the prep
aration of the said diphtheria antl-toxine and
in the issuance thereof.
ROBERT M. FUNKHOUSRR.
FRANK BOOGHER, M. D.
JOHN D. FITZSIMMONS, Deputy.
For some time the City Health Depart
ment has been making an anti-toxlne for
use In diphtheria cases. This was dis
tributed among practicing physicians
throughout the city free of charge and
used in the city institutions quite gener
ally. In many cases it is said to have
saved lives. The serum that caused death
was obtained from horses that are said
to have contracted tetanus and to have
imparted it to the anti-toxine drawn from
their bodies.
After rendering his verdict, Coroner
Funkhouser said:
"For the present I have dona all that
I can do. I am not prepared to say I
am through with the case, but, so far as
I know, there is nothing more for me to
do. I have rendered the verdict, and that
is all I have been called upon to do thus
far."
The Coroner's verdict Is based upon the
testimony of physicians who attended tha
lockjaw cases, witnesses at the inquest
and the report of the bacteriologists em
ployed by the city to make tests of the
infected serum and ascertain the respon
sibility for It. The experts are Dr. Carl
Fich, Dr. B. Mead Bolton and Dr. E. C.
Walden, who examined several patients
who had been infected by city anti-toxine
before they began their experiments. In
their experiments seventy-four guinea
pigs were used. The report of the ex
perts contains 7000 words. It was filed
with Coroner Funkhouser Friday and was
given out with the verdict to-day.
When informed of the nature of tho
Coroner's verdict. Dr. Amand Ravold,
city bacteriologist, said:
"I repeat my previous assertion that
none of the serum marked September SO
was distributed to any one or under any
label. I poured the entire drawing into
the sink on October 11, as both Mr. Tay
lor, who was with me in the. office at the
time, and I testified."
. Health Commissioner Starkloff is out
of the city on a hunting trip. In his ab
sence Charles W. Francis, Assistant
Health Commissioner, is in charge of the
department. He said:
"I shall read the report of the experts
and the Coroner's verdict and then take
such action as I deem to be my duty
"As the manufacture of anti-toxine' by
tho city has been stopped, the case is
not now one of emergency, and I may
not decide for several days on the action
which I shall take."
The bacteriologists who tested the anti
toxine conclude their report with the fol
lowing implied charge of carelessness on
the,part of the Health Department offi
cials:
.."^JS a , re fo F, c ? d , to conclude that the
diphtheria anti-toxine prepared by the
City Health Department had been Issued

Articulate a bit. He shouldered 112

Brown Colt Even Money Choice.
The brown colt was an even money

Brutal was expected to do something, but
the tooting was very evidently not io his

Alter two or three unsuccessful at

closed a 3 to 2 favorite, and in a severe
drive J. Woods got her over the line a

to The Maniac.

had him in front from the start. Lizzella
came from behind under strong urging,
getting the place by a neck from Sunello.
His second mount of the day, Winnie
O'Connor brought In Bedeck first for the
closing seven-furlong run. The chestnut
reigned a 9 to 10 favorite and though
given a spirited argument by Gusto beat
the latter horse cleverly at the wire. Hor
toii could aot negotiate the going, finish
ing a distant third.
Track Notes.
The horses of L. V. Bell, the wealthy
New Yorker, will arrive at Oakland to
day. In the same car will come two
horses owned by the father of Redfern,
the Jockey; two horses the property of
Jockey Owen Mounce's father, and the
speedy May W, which is being returned
to her owner, D. Cameron. Redfern, the
rider, will be here inside of a fortnight.
Bullman will make his reappearance in
the saddle at Oakland this afternoon. His
weight is now 110 pounds, and he will
ride as a free lance during the season,
Â¦"Chappie" Porteous attending to all en
gagements.
Tom Ryan, famous for his many turf
coups, landed at Oakland Sunday night
with a stable of very shifty performers.
Jockeys W. Buchanan and Owen
Mounce were expected to arrive last

MANAGER KENNEDY TAKES
LOCAL COIN TO NEW YORK
Gees East With the Biggest Share
of the Recent Fight
Proceeds.
Jim ' Kennedy, manager of the Twen
tieth Century Athletic Club, a corpor
ation organized in New Yftrk to do busi
ness in San Francisco, left for the home
office of the concern yesterday, carrying
with htm the largest portion of the pro
moters' proceeds of the recent fistic fiasco
at the Pavilion. Kennedy will probably
remain in New York until the harrowing
memories of the Jeffries-Ruhlin fight are
forgotten and the club gets ready to pull
off another championship battle. Only a
trifling percentage of the big profits of
the fight remain in this city. The $500
HaFry Corbett received for his services as
referee will find its way back into the
various local business channels. James
\V. Coffroth, secretary of the Superior
Court, and "Jack" Gleason both received
a neat sum for securing the permit from
the Supervisors and attending to the var
ious other local details, of the big fight,
but the bulk of the money went back to
New York safely stowed away in Jim
Kennedy's wallet.
NEW YORK HORSE SHOW
OPENS WITH MANY ENTRIES
NEW YORK, Nov. 18.â The New York
Horse Show, the great American horse
fair, began to-day at Madison Square
Garden. The formal entries outnumber
by hundreds those of any previous year
and represent the noblest type to which
the thoroughbred has been developed and
the greatest advance in vehicle building
with the latest decrees of fashion as to
livery, harness and handling. Perfect
weather favored the opening.
Twenty-five horses suitable to become
hunters were the first animals brought
before the Judges. The blue ribbon went
to Lord Minto, owned by George Pepper
of Toronto. The jumpers came next and
nearly fifty handsome horses went over
the hurdles. Crow & Murray's Sure Pop
won the first place, with Lord Minto,
winner in the first trial, a close second.
Eben Jordan's Prime Minister was ad-
Judged a better pony stallion than
Tliomas W. Lawson's Glorious Bonnie
and sports the blue now. In pony stal
lions under 12.1 Doncaster Model, owned
by Robert Whltworth of England, was
awarded first honors. P. A. B. Widener
Jr.'s Vixen won the first place among the
pony brood mares other than Shetlands.
Alfred G. Vanderbilt drove his own
entry in the class for four-in-hand teams
not under 14 and not exceeding 15 hands.
Vandertiilt received only the white rib
bon, however, the blue going to the four
entered in the name of Mrs. R. F. Car
man of Huntington. L. 1., driven by her
husband.
Sharkey Asks for Delay.
NEW YORK, Nov. 18.-Tom Sharkey
will ask J. C. KenneJy. manager of the
Twentieth Century Athletic Club In San
Francisco, to change tne date of his fight
with Jeffries from December 20 to Janu
ary 1. Sharkey said tc-day:
"I want to give all rr.y friends a chance
to win back the money they lost on me
when I fought Jeffries before. For that
reason I want a little more time to get In
proper condition to meet the champion."

OLYMPIC CLUB TO BRING
OFT SIX AMATEUR BOUTS
Crack Boxers Will Appear at Club
on the Evening of No
vember 29.
Six rattling jrood special boxing matches
will be brought off at the Olympic Club
gymnasium on Friday evening, November
29. All of the Olympic Club boys who
have been matched are already in train
ing, and the unattached boxers and repre
sentatives of the smaller clubs who will
appear are also rapidly conditioning them
selves. The result of the matches will in
all probability settle the question of who
will be picked to go East this winter to
box in the American championship tour
nament, which takes place In New York
during the latter part of January. It is
the intention of the Olympic Club to send
several fast men, including Jimmy Britt
Andy Gallaghfer and perhaps Billy Leon
ard, back East to participate in the tour
nament.
O'BREEN GETS DECISION
IN THE SEVENTH ROUND
"Harlem Coffee Cooler" Shows White
Feather in Fight With the
Philadelphian.
LONDON, Nov. 18.â At the National
Sporting Club to-night "Jack" O'Brien of
Philadelphia defeated Frank Craig, the
"Harlem Coffee Cooler," after seven
rounds of a ten-round bout. The Harlem
boy was disqualified for falling without
a blow. Craig made wild rushes and re
peatedly fell without having been struck.
O'Brien was a strong favorite in the bet
ting, in spite of his bad condition, and did
almost all of the scoring in a farcical and
disappointing contest.
Kid McCoy and McKeever have chal
lenged the winner and it is probable that
a match will be arranged between mc-
Keever and O'Brien.

serve on a board appointed to make rec
ommendations for the establishment of
new army posts, the abandonment of oth

Rheumatism
Â¦,: 'Â¦ \ r '". . Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦
Rheumatic pains are the cries of protest
and distress from tortured muscles, aching
joints and excited nerves. The blood has
been poisoned by the accumulation of
.waste matter in the system, and can no
longer supply the pure and health sustain-
ing food they require. The whole system
feels the effect of this acid poison ; and
not until the blood has been purified and
brought back to a healthy condition will
the aches and pains cease.
Mrs. James Kelt, of 707 Ninth street. N. 8.,
Washington, ID. C, writes as follows: "A few
months ago I had an attack of Sciatic Rheuma-
tism in its worst form. The / -
pain was so intense that I , . .-. _.

twist his bowels. Men are only boys grown tall. In such a case what is needed
is not a violent physic that will rack the tender bowel tissues, but Cascarets

TWO VICTIMS OF THE
FUMES OF DEADLY GAS j
Colorado Miner Meets Accidental
Death and an Insane Japanese
Commits Suicide.
Two cases of gas asphyxiation were re
ported at the Morgue up to 5 p. m. yes
terday.
The first was that of G. S. Snow, a
miner, who came from Granite, Chafa
County, Colo., to witness the Jeffries-
Ruhlin prizefight. Snow was found dead
In his bed in the International Hotel yes
terday morning with the gas escaping
from an open jet. Mr. Snow was 6o years
old and was married. He Informed the
hotel people on Sunday that he intended
to start on his return home last evening.
As he was not a drinking man and went
to bed sober and was in the best of
spirits, the theory of suicide is untenable,
and that of accident is probable only on
the hypothesis that he left the gas burn-
Ing when he went to sleep and a sudden
diminution of pressure extinguished the
flame. His watch and chain and $136 were
found in his pockets.
M. Kamaruki, a native of Japan, com
mitted suicide last Sunday night by
turning on the gas in his room at the
Hoffman House, 521 Pacific street. A let
ter in Japanese characters was found in
the pockets of the man's trousers, in
which he bequeaths his socks to one
friend and his clothing to another. The
contents of the letter show that he was
Insane.
St. Mary the Virgin's Bazaar.
At the bazaar which is to be given by
the Altar Society of the Church of St.
Mary the Virgin on the afternoons and
evenings of November 19. 20 and 21 many
beautiful articles and novelties suitable
for Christmas presents will be disposed
of. The bazaar is to be held in the hall
adjoining the r hurch, at Steiner and Un
ion streets. One of the features of the
festival will be the serving of refresh
ments by young ladies attired in Japanese
and PTiritan costumes. No admission will
i>Â» efeÂ«.rgÂ«d, and entertaining- mustcal pro
grammes will be rendered In the evening.
Instead of using tea or fiF^^ESI
alcoholic drinks as astim- f*^BK/y%
ulant when fatigued, Vf^^^z&A
chilled or depressed, take Bciiip^B

COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY.
WASHINGTON forecasts of the President's
message announce that he will recommend
the establishment of a Department of Com
merce- and Industry with a Cabinet officer at its head.
The report is not surprising, for the subject has been
long under discussion. In fact the Republican Na
tional Convention at Philadelphia put into the party
platform the declaration: "In the interest of our ex
panding commerce we recommend that Congress cre
ate a Department of Commerce and Industries, in
charge of a Secretary, with a seat in the Cabinet."
The President's recommendation 'therefore would be
in line with the general policy of his party and would
be sure of receiving strong support in both houses.
The proposed new department would not lack for
work. Our industries are growing and our commerce
expanding at an extraordinary rate. At the present
time our commercial dealings with foreign nations are
largely promoted by our Consuls, who are under the
control of the State Department. It is believed that
nearly the whole of the consular work could be trans
ferred to the Department of Commerce, though, of
course, the Consuls themselves would have to remain
officers and agents of the State Department, because
they are so often called upon to perform diplomatic
duties. It has been suggested that the Consuls might
remain officers of the State Department but all of
their commercial reports be turned over for editing
and publication by the. Department of Commerce,
While any information that the Commerce Department
wished from abroad could be obtained by request
through the State Department.
Whatever may be the division of work between the
new department and the present ones which are now
handling commercial affairs, it is certain there would
have to be an improvement in the consular service.
For an understanding of the commercial relations of
different countries and of the best means of promot
ing American trade, it will be necessary that the con
sular service be composed of men of commercial train
ing and of experience. The establishment of the De
partment of Commerce will probably lead to that re
form and should it do so its beneficial effect upon the
country will be noted at once.
It is not to be overlooked that the proposed new
department is to have supervision of industries as well
ommerce. It may be that the industries will in
clude mining as well as manufacturing, and should it
be so the mining men instead of getting a department
to themselves, as they have long desired, would have
to be content with a bureau in the Department of
Commerce and Industries. Even that would be bet
ter than the present system of governmental super
vision of mines and mining, but it would not be any
thing like what the miners desire, nor what the mag
nitude and'importance of the industry demands. It is
clear, however, that if the miners hope to obtain their
Cabinet department they will have to set about the
work of getting support for it at once. The task is
not going to be an easy one, but it will probably be
harder still in the future should mining be made a
subordinate bureau in the new department.
If all the Congressmen who wish an appropriation
for a river, harbor or public building in their dis
tricts have their way. there will be no reduction of
the war taxes this year, nor for many a year to come.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1Â», 1901.
LIMITED QUARANTINE.
THE proposition for a .quarantine against tuber
culosis originated in California. Members of
the State Board felt that the widespread knowl
edge of the clemency of our climate was working
hardship to the State by making it a popular sani
tarium for the victims of consumption. That dis
ease was not indigenous here, but has been imported
and planted, as it was in Minnesota and Colorado.
The proposal to stamp it out by quarantine was widely
discussed, but did not pass beyond the academic stage.
It developed, however, that California is not the
only sufferer. The rapid increase of the dreadful dis
ease is exciting widespread apprehension. Not only
in this country but in Europe physicians and people
are considering the way to preventive and remedial
measures. It has been proposed to find an isolated
spot where the climate is most favorable to treatment
and recovery of patients and make that a sort of world's
reservation for consumptives, all the suffering nation^
sharing in providing everything that sense and scien-il
have suggested and discovered for their relief. / It iJ
not generally known that a commission of French phy
sicians and experts has been exploring the world fof
such a location. They examined the oases of the Sa
hara and some of the Asian deserts, and finally report
that the best conditions are indicated at Las Cruccs,
in New Mexico, not far from El Paso, Texas. They
say that for a radius of fifty miles from that point
there are the requisites of dryness, purity of air, con
stancy of sunshine and all other physical condition!
most favorable to a cure.
The principle of natural selection had already
marked certain localities in Arizona and New Mexico
as the best for consumptives, and great numbers o(
the unfortunate have sought these for a long time.
But this has developed a new danger arising in con
tact on the trains. All the roads leading westward
carry great numbers of consumptives at certain sea
sons of the year. They are in the Pullman cars, mixed
with other passengers and with no method of disin
fecting their sputum. Their suffering excites sympa
thy, and the danger of contact with them arouses fear
in their fellow travelers, so that many a journey in
tended for pleasure is anything but pleasant.
So marked has this feature of Western travel be
come that the Travelers' Association has taken the'
matter up and has requested the Western Passenger
Associations to arrange for a limited railway quaran
tine, by providing cars for their patients exclusively,
to which others are not admitted. We believe the
railways have concluded that they have not the power
under the law of common carriers to isolate one class
of passengers. This is probably true, and if so, the
movement must aim at reinforcement of the request
for isolation by amendments to the interstate com
merce law which will relieve the railways of their legal
liability tc passengers to whom they refuse access to
any part of a train. If this is done, the roads may run
on each train an invalid car, or on stated days a hos
pital train; in either case special provision may be
made for the comfort of patients, and they may enjoy
many advantages required by their condition which
they do not have now.
Thousands of travelers appreciate the need of this
limited quarantine. If would be well if the organiza
tion that has started it have some place in Chicago
where travelers may join in signing a petition to Con
gress for the needed legislation. In that way a strong
backing could be secured that will push the plan to
a success, which will be highly appreciated by tlie
general public, and will come to be just as popular
with the patients who are its beneficiaries.
The London Review of Reviews says that if at this
time there were to be a European coalition against
the English-speaking nations, Great Britain could not
furnish a man to lead and that she would have to ac
cept the leadership of Roosevelt, and Washington
would become the virtual capital of the two nations.
It is a good saying as it stands, but the "if" at the
head of it is too large to be swallowed by any cre
dulity.
SUMMARY OP POPULATION.
FROM the Census Bureau there has just
been issued the final report which com
pletes the series of bulletins giving the
population of the several States and Territories
in 1900 with respect to sex, general nativity and
color. The total population of the country after the
final revision of the figures 15 given at 76,303,387.
That sum includes not only the inhabitants of the
States and organized Territories, but also all persons
enumerated at military and naval stations abroad and
in Alaska, Hawaii, Indian Territory and tfle Indian
reservations. The population for the equivalent area
in 1890 was 63,069,756.
The proportion of males to population in 1900 was
51.2 per cent and females 48.8. It is stated that from
these percentages it would appear there has been no
change in the proportion of sexes in 1900 as com
pared with 1890, but, as a matter of fact, there is a
slightly larger proportion of females now than there
were ten years ago; the percentage decimals if ex
tended to the hundredths, showing for females 48.81
per cent in 1900, as compared with 48.76 per cent in
1890.
Considered with respect to general nativity there
were in the last census year 65,843,302 native born
persons in the population and 10,460,085 foreign born.
Thus the foreign element constituted 13.7 per cent
of the total population in 1900, while it was 14.8 per
cent ten years ago.
The analysis according to color shows that at the
last census there were 66,990,802 white persons and
9.312,585 colored persons, the latter including 8,840,789
persons of negro descent, 119,050 Chinese, 85,986 jap-,
anese and 266,760 Indians. The colored population
constituted 12.2 per cent di the total population in
1900, as against 12.5 per cent in 1890. The white popu
lation shows an increase during the decade of 21.4
per cent, while the colored element as a whole shows
an increase of but 17.8 per cent. It is to be noted,
however, that while the negroes increased during the
decade by 18. 1 per cent and the Japanese by 497.2
per cent, the Chinese decreased by 6.1 per cent and
the Indians by 2.5 per cent.
One of the significant features of the report is the
showing that persons of negro descent have not in
creased since 1890 relatively as fast as the whites.
When the entire area of population is taken in con
sideration, the increase of whites has been 21.4. while
that of the blacks is but 18. 1. If an examination be
made of the relative increases of the two elements
in the South Atlantic and South Central divisions of
the country, in which nearly nine-tenths of all negroes
are found, the same conditions are apparent. In the
South Atlantic division there has been an increase
of the white population of 19.9 per cent, as compared
with an increase in the negro population of 14.3 per
cent; while in the South Central division the whites,
have increased 29.1 per cent and the negro ele
ment 19.9 per cent.
, As a result of these differences of increase Lousiana
has ceased to be a black State, her white population
now exceeding the black. At the present time Mis
sissippi and South Carolina are the only States in
which the blacks outnumber the whites, at^d as South
Carolina is rapidly developing a manufacturing indus
try which will attract immigrants from the North, it
is likely that within another decade her white popula
tioh will exceed that of the negroes. It is to be
noted finally that there is evidence of a migration of
negroes from the South to several of the Northern
â¢States, and this may eventually lead to such diffusion
of the race as will go far toward ridding the South
of the black problem.
It appears the British War Office is too much for
Lord Roberts and he is going to quit without waiting
to take part in the coronation ceremonies. It was
believed that when he turned over the command in
South Africa and went home Roberts was seeking an
easy 'job, but the event proves that Kitchener's posi
tion is the more comfortable of the two.
CHILD LABOR IN THE SOUTH.
WITH the increase of the manufacturing in
dustry in the South the people of that sec
tion of the Union have been called up*m to
confront several labor problems which the people of
the North and the West have settled long ago. One
of these, is that of employing child labor in the newly
established factories. Mill owners have ever been in
clined to take advantage of cheap child labor wherever
they could. It was so in old England and in New
England. It is therefore not strange that the same
practice would have been introduced in the Southern
States, and it is a foregone conclusion that the over
throw of the system will require a long and a hard
fight.
In two important respects the people who are fight
ing against child labor in the South have advantages
over those who made the same fight in Great Britain
and in the Northern States. They have a body of
public sentiment already formed to which they can
appeal; and they have also strongly organized labor
unions to help them in the contest. By reason of
these advantages the struggle in the South may end
in a victory for the children much more promptly
than in the older manufacturing centers. In fact con
siderable progress has been already made in several
States and it is not at all unlikely that legislation simi
lar to that in Northern States on the subject will be
enacted ir. some of the Southern States in the near
future.
A curious phase in the Southern fight against the
abuse of child labor is the recent appeal made by
Southern reformers to "the people and press of New
England." The appeal appears strange to those who
are not familiar with the situation, for it is not ap
parent on the face of things how New England sen
timent could be influential in promoting legislation in
the South. It happens, however, that so many South
ern mills are owned by New Englanders that the peo
ple have begun to classify the mills into what they
call "Northern mills," or those owned in the North,
and "Southern mills," or those owned by local capi
tal. Southern sentiment can work effectively upon
the Southern owners, but New England sentiment is
desired to influence thfc New England owners.
The most significant paragraph* in the appeal says:
"While the proportion of children under 12 in our
Northern and Southern mills is approximately the
same, yet in the mills representing Northern invest
ments the number of such children employed is twice
as great as the number found in the mills controlled
by Southern capital." As the appeal comes from Ala
bama and is signed exclusively by Alabama men, it
may represent the condition of affairs in the" mills of
that State only. It is probable, however, that in other
Southern States the situation is not essentially differ
ent, and it would seem, therefore, that in going South
the Northern capitalists have been seeking not only
a milder climate and cheaper raw material but also
cheaper labor, even if they have to resort to children
to get it.
From all reports the evil has become a serious one.
The wages paid to the children range from 25 and 50
cents a day and in some cases parents have been found
living in idleness on the wages earned by children un
der 12 years of age. The profits to the mill owners
from such labor seems to be considerable, and their
opposition to any legislation on the subject has been
persistent and strong. The issue affects Northern
labor as well as Southern, for the New England fac
tory hand is forced to compete against the cheap labor
of the South. It is therefore quite proper that the
Southern reformers have appealed to Northern senti
ment for assistance In bringing about the enactment
of laws that will put sn end to the practice.
THE GROWTH OF NATIONS.
SIR ROBERT GIFFEN, the British statistician,
has compiled a series of tables showing the
growth and development of the principal na
tions of the world during the last century. Briefly
summarized, the figures show that during the nine
teenth century the population of the Unrted States in
creased from 5,000,000 to 76,000,000; that of the Brit
ish Empire (English speaking) from 15,000,000 to 55,
00,000; that of Germany from 20,000,000 to 55,000,000;
that of France from 25,000,000 to 40,000,000; that of
Russia from 40,000,000 to 135,000,000.
The figures of population do not, of course, tell the
whok story. From an economic point of view the
enormous population of Russia counts for less than
that of Germany or Great Britain and very much less
than that of the United States. The century saw the
United States advance from a very low place among
the nations to the foremost rank. We have now not
only the largest civilized population on the globe but
the producing and consuming power of that popula
tion is far in excess of any other.
The prospects of the coming century show a clear
field for an increasing lead on the part of the United
States, until in time this country will have attained a
supremacy fuily equal to that enjoyed by Great
Britain fifty years ago. Neither Great Britain nor
Germany can greatly increase in population. In fact
each has already gone beyond the limit that can be well
supported by the home yield of foodstuffs and both
are dependent upon the import of food from abroad.
In the United States, on the other hand, the popu
lation is far below the number that the soil is capable
of maintaining. Moreover, we have abundant re
sources of iron, coal and other materials required by
the industries of civilization, while the countries that
to-day are our rivals are becoming deficient in all of
them. 'Â£he future, therefore, is ours. The gain we
made in the nineteenth century will be as nothing to
what we will make in the twentieth.
There is some talk about Mrs. Bradley Martin get
ting a tiara at a cost of more than $1,000,000 so that
she can outshine the Queen of England at the corona
tion ceremonies, but the thing won't go. The Queen
could see the Bradley-Martin gems and put them out
of sight by simply wearing the Kohinoor.
NOME PLACERS MAY HAVE
BEEN WORKED YEARS AGO
RELICS were recently unearthed in
Alaska which seem to prove be
yond a doubt that the Nome
placer fields were worked by
white men about the time the
Spaniards were pursuing their discoveries
and explorations on the Pacific Coast.
What manner of men these ancient miners
were or where they""came from is a mat
ter of conjecture, but judging from one
of the relics which they left behind they
were in all probability of the Catholic
faith.
While Charles Kennedy was recently
Working his claim on the Oregon Creek
he unearthed a rocker of antiquated pat
tern. The rocker had been buried seven
feet beneath the surface and had evi
dently remained there for many years.
The ground about showed no indications
of having recently been disturbed, neither
was there any evidence forthcoming: to
Bhow to what extent the mine had been
Worked.
The rocker was not the only memento
of these ancient gold seekers that Ken
nedy discovered. Alongside of the rocker,
resting in a pan, he found a metallic sub
stance, black and circular and about the
size of a half-dollar. After the dirt ac
cumulated in years had been scoured from
its surface It proved to be a silver me
dallion. Engraved on one side was a rep
resentation of the Lord's supper, while
on the reverse side was depicted a figure
kneeling devoutely before a crucifix with
a dove, the emblem of purity, hovering
in a cloud overhead.
On the same side is an inscription
"Plus VII, P. M. XV." Pius VII was the
Pope who placed the crown on the head
of Napoleon I and was subsequently made
a virtual prisoner by that monarch. He
undoubtedly conferred the medallion as a
special mark of distinction on some Span
iard who was about to embark on a voy
age of exploration in the new world.
Perhaps he was some missionary who was
about to set forth to carry the Catholic
faith to the Indians of America. But ho\y

Chinese Sarcasm.
There are many people who regard an
editor's position as a "soft thing," and a
certain number of these persons have
made their appearance in unaccustomed
China, where <they are expending much
time and labor in the correction and god
ly admonition of the editor of a native
paper, whose robust reform proclivities
are offending against the immutable laws
of his land. Driven at length to defend
himself, the harassed journalist addressed
to his critics a brief editorial, of which
the following translation gives an idea of
the Chinese conception of sarcasm, erro
neously declared to be non-existent by
many travelers. After a preliminary ac
knowledgment of fallibility the article
proceeds:
"In future nothing which may be de
scribed as new will appear in these col
umns, and thereby prevent people's un
derstandings^ f;om being enlightened.
None but bigoted members of the con
ceited Herat! will ever be called to assist
upon the editorial Staff. We shall confine
ourselves to the affairs of the last dynas
ty, carefully avoiding all reference to the
family that now rules China. We shall
give our special attention to fortune tell
ing, witchcraft and kindred subjects of
truth, of which no one has any doubt. A
place of supreme importance will be given
to the revered teachings of geomancy, and
we shall show that a man's good luck or
misfortune is controlled by the stars. We
shall respectfully beg his Majesty to ob

darins follow their excellent and time
honored methods of transacting business.
We shall resist with all our strength
every attempt to Introduce reforms, and
lest we should be tempted to record any
current events we resolve from this time
forward to dispense with the services of
all reporters as a useless waste of money.
We hope in this way to earn the good will
and support of all our readers, firmly be
lieving that if we faithfuly do according
to this honest and admirable advice the
benefit will be manifested to all."

Roosevelt Story.
President Roosevelt was not always the
mighty hunter he is now, says a writer
in Harper's Weekly. He has had his day
of being afraid of big game. But that
was many years ago, when he was a wee
little boy in short trousers, and used to
play tag in Madison square in New York.
Opposite the square, on the east side,
stood a Presbyterian church; and the
sexton, while airing the building one Sat
urday, noticed a small boy peering curi
ously in at the half-open door, but mak
ing no .move to enter.
"Come in, my little man, if you wish
to," said the sexton.
"No, thank you," said the boy; "I know
what you've got in there."
"I haven't anything that little boys
mayn't see. Come In."
"I'd rather not." And the Juvenile Theo
dore cast a sweeping and somewhat ap
prehensive glance around the pews and
galleries and bounded off to play again
Still the lad kept returning once In a
while and peeping in. When he went
home that day he told his mother of the
sexton's invitation and his unwillingness
to accept it. 8 M
"But why didn't you go in, my dear?"
she asked. "It is the house of God but
there is no harm in entering it auietlv
and looking about." q " Iy
With some shyness the little fellow con
fessed that he was afraid to go in because
the zeal might jump out at him from un
der a pew or somewhere.
"The zeal? What is the zeal'" the
mother inauired.
"Why," explained Theodore, "I suDDose

alligator. I went there to church last
Sunday with Uncle R . and I heard the
minister read from the Bible about the
zeal, and it frightened me."
Down came the Concordance from the
library shelf, and one after another the
texts containing the word "zeal" was
read to the child, whose eyes suddenly
grew big and his voice excited, as he ex
claimed:
"That's it-the last you read!"
It was Psalm lxix:9: "For the zeal of
thine house hath eaten me up "

FROM A FOOD EXPERT^

SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Dec. 20. 1900.
The Malted Cereals Co..
Gentlemenâ The truest thing in the ad-
vertisements of Malt Breakfast Food
which you have published is that "the
firm starts the goods, and quality does
the the rest." ,
Little children who tire of everything in
the- cereal line will take up this food and
cling to it with no desire for a change
much longer than they will any other
food.
It is a fact that my own youngster, who
has passed by everything I have been
able to find in the market after a few
days, has put the seal of his approval on
Malt Breakfast Food to the exte;
insisting upon having it three times jht
day, and this condition has existed now
for <^er six weeks, during which time I
question if a day has gone by without his
having It for breakfast, lunch and 3to\>-

For the old folks I believe that this Is
the mcst satisfactory thing on the mar-

HARSH WORDS
BRING BATTLE
Brisk Fight Occurs at
Official Meeting in
Stockton.
Chairman of Supervisors and
County Clerk Come to
Blows,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Nov. 18.â As a result of an
old-standing feud of a political nature,
aggravated by a discussion in the board
to-day over a contract, Orrin S. Hender
son, chairman of the Board of Supervis
ors, and Otto. Grunsky, Count) Clerk,
came to blows.
In the course of a reply to remarks
made by Supervisor Knight, Grunsky
passed strictures upon the board and par
ticularly on the chairman, who, in turn,
resented the remarks. The two hurled al
legations uncomplimentary in nature, and
each called into question the official con
duct of the other.
While the board was talcing a recess
Grunsky stood behind a desk condemning
the board and its methods. Suddenly
Henderson ontered the room and stood
behind the railing in the space set apart
for spectators. Grunsky pointed his fin
ger at him and saÂ«d:
"Henderson, you or your henchmen
have been in my private drawers. You are
just what I have always said you were, a
sneak thief and a scoundrel."
"If you say I have been in your draw
ers you are a liar." responded Henderson,
coolly. GrunsKy sprang over the table
and landed at the railing, facing Hender
son.
â¢ Then how do you know that I have
those papers in my drawer?" demanded
the County Cherk. hotly.
"That's my 'affair," answered Hender
son.
Grunsky swung his right arm viciously.
Henderson stepped back and the fist
grazed his cheek. Grunsky staggered and
partly fell from the force of the intended
blow. He was cm his feet in an instant
and over the rai|ng. He made for Hen
derson, and the nttter stepped back and
squared off for the attack.
Grunsky struck again and Henderson
parried the blow. At the same instant
Deputy Johnson caught his chief by the
arm. Deputy Salbach started to go in to
pull the men apart, but Supervisor FrcncK
shoved him back and locked the gate.
"Fair play." roared French. "I won't
see two men jump rtn one "
Supervisor Knight yelled. "Fight, fight!
That is the way to clear it up."
In the opinion of spectators the Clerk
was the aggressor. Friends of the two
combatant? are trying to make peace.

GALE NOW RAGING ALONG SHORE
IS MAKING IT HARD FOR COASTERS
Steamship Umatilla* From Puget Sound Ports* Arrives Behind
TimeâLumber Fleet Is Sighted Riding Out the Storm*
THE PACIFIC STEAM WHALING COMPANY'S VALENCIA IN A STORM IN BERING SEA. SHE WAS SWEPT
BY THE W.AfVES AND THE FORECASTLE AND CABIN FLOODED, WHILE HER PASSENGERS AND CREW
FEARED FOR HER SAFETY.
AMONtJ the vessels that arrived
yesterday were the ex-transport
Valencia and the bark Gayhead.
Both had hard times, one in the
Bering Sea and the other in the
sea of Okhotsk. The Gayhead failed in
her season's work through the fog that
prevailed on the Inland Sea and off the
Japanese coast, while the Valencia had a
veTjr rough experience, but rode the gales
cut like the splendid sea boat she is and
came into port yesterday morning some
what damaged, but stiu ready to make
another voyage should she be called upon
to act as a troopship. The Valencia was
in the Nome trade, but on her last trip
was sent from the Sound to Hunters Bay
by the Pacific Steam Whaling company
to bring home the cannery hands and the
last of the season's pack. She arrived
yesterday morning after a run of six and
a half days with a big crowd of fisher
men and more than 39,000 cases of salmon.
Captain Lane reports an unusually rough
time of it, while the fishermen swear that
had it not been for the direct interposi
tion of Providence all hands would have
been drowned. Captain Lane said:
The Valencia left Hunters Bay on Septem
ber 0 and at once ran into a southeaster. It
blew avjjurricane, and for hours at a time
the decks were never clear of water. We got
a little canvas on her, but the wind blew the
sails into ribbons. Then the wind shifted a
few points and it blew, if anything, harder
from the south.
On November 12, when the gale was at Its
height, I was called to see a sick Chinese. He
was in the last stages of consumption and
at death's door. In spite of my anxiety over
the safety of the ship I had to attend to him,
but he died and the next day was buried.
November 13 It blew another southeaster. The
waves came over and washed out the fore
castle. The cabins were flooded and the pas
sengers washed out of their berths. Part of
the railing was carried away and the canvas
stripped from the hatch combings. We set a
fores-ail, but it was blown into ribbons, and
one sea swept the bridge and nearly carried
away the quartermaster. It was a lively time
while it lasted, and I now think more of the
Valencia as a stanch, well found sea boat than
I ever cid before.
All the passengers and fishermen from
the Valencia were landed at Folsom-
Btreet wharf about noon. They were
more than glad to get ashore.
Umatilla Arrives.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Umatilla arrived from Puget Sound ports
last evening. She was twelve hours be
hind time and did not reach quarantine
in time for the doctor to pass her. Cap
tain Cousins repor*;- unusually heavy
weather off the Columbia River. A num
ber of vessels of the lumber fleet were
sighted, but none of them could be made
out. All were undor short canvas and
apparently riding out the gale in comfort.
The Umatilla brings a big crowd of pas
sengers and more than 1000 tons of cargo.
A report of the voyÂ«ge will not be re
ceived until this morning arid the passen
gers will not land untU 8 a. m.

aged.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. IS.-Products
of Alaska valued at $200,000 were brought
to Seattle as the cargo of a single vessel
by the Senator, Captain James B. Patter
son, which arrived from the north to-day.
Â¦Fish and fish products made up the entire
shipment. There were 37,215 cases of sal
mon from Petersburg, Girard Point and
Sitka Bay canneries, 2500 cases of fish
guano and 550 barrels of fish oil from the
Kllisnoo fisheries.
Returning, the Senator got aground on
a rocky bottom at the north entrance to
Wrangle Narrows, bending several plates
on the starboard side forward; She hung
fast about twenty minutes and then
hauled herself off. While the springing
of the plates did not cause a leak it may
later be necessary for the vessel to go
into drydock.
The Senator brought eighty-nine pas
sengers from various southeastern Alaska
points, prominent among whom were Pro
fessoc C. C. Georgeson, special agent of
the United States Agricultural Depart
ment; W. T. Summers, president of the
First National Bank of Juneau, and Dr.
B. K. Wilbur of Sitka,

REDDING. Nov. 18â The Baptist par
sonage, occupied by the Rev. Daniel Bald
win and his wife and adjoining the
church, was entered by burglars last
evening. Before the church service a
stranger called and asked Mr. Baldwin to
go to see a sick man. The pastor went
and found no one at the address. A
stranger called meanwhile, found Mrs.
Baldwin at home and hurried away. Evi
dently the burglars were trying to get the
occupants away from 1-ome. Upon return
ing from church Mr. Baldwin found that
a front window had been opened with a
jimmy. The house luiu" been robbed of
jewelry and a small amount of coin.
The room of Charles W. Pope, a real
estate dealer, was ent-.red by a burglar,
who was frightened away by a noise in
the next room. The intruder dropped ,a
sharp knife made out of a file. It bears
the number 1195, and is the kind which
convicts contrive to make in prison.

A POSSIBILITY
That Became a Fact and Pleases Many
Bald People.
A. R. "Lewis, M. D.. in a lengthy article
In the columns of the American Journal
of Health, says concerning hair: "It's de-
terioration is a constant source of worri-
ment to humanity, consequently bald peo-
ple are readily deceived by 'fake' hair
restoratives. The wish that a hair prep-
aration will 'nil the bill* is father to the
fancy that it is likely to do so. A rare
case in point is that of Newbro's Herpi-
cide, which actually does 'fill the bill.' It
destroys the parasite that attacks the
hair root, and prevents dandruff, falling:
hair and baldness."

to 71% c. The weakness in the coarser grains
had : a . depressing Influence, 'â¢ :> but Â£; at Â¦â¢ the ' low
prices shorts covered freely and sent December
up slightly. The close 'was weak. 1 %@%c lower,'
j at ,71% c. Considering '4 the volume of bearish
| ammunition Â¦ fired at J this I pit I the * traders - feel

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ The week opened with a weaker
market, both in this country and Europe. The
English visible supply decreased 336,000 bushels.
The world's shipments for the week were as
follows, in quarters: Russian, 18,000; Danubian,
108,000; Argentine, 3000; Indian, $6000; Austra
lian, 25,000. The weather In the Argentine was
reported better, and the crop there is -now
looking favorably. The complaint for a week
back has been too much rain. The amount on
passage to England increased 1,920,000 bushels.
The American visible supply increased 3,718,000
bushels.
Chicago declined under large Northwestern
receipts and indifferent cables. The very large
increase in the visible supply, coupled with
weakness in the coarse grains, caused consid
erable realizing, and a good deal of wheat was
Â¦ thrown over by outside longs. The engagement
' of $6,500,000 in gold for Europe also started
New York to selling, and there was general re
' alizinr all around.
This market was steady as to shipping
grades, but weak on call.

Special Dispatch to The Call. '
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 18.â A Coro
ner's jury in the case of Mrs. Vera Ger
trude West of Aqua Caliente, Arizona,
who was killed in a room in tire Phoenix
Hotel last Friday night, brought in a ver
dict this afternoon that she came to her
Âeath by a pistol shot fired by her own
iand. Frank D. Quigley, who was with
her at the time, was exonerated from any
criminal connection with the affair.
From the first there were suspicious cir
cumstances connected with the shooting.
From notes found in the room and from
Quigley's own statement the two had
agreed to die together. Quigley said he
was to fall asleep, while she was to put a
bullet through his brain and then end her
own life. She carried out the agreement
only to the extent of killing herself. Af
xer the shooting it was found that the re
volver contained but one cartridge.
Quigley was the first witness. He told"
of his first meeting with Mrs. West last
September, after she left her husband. He
.^aid that with the exception of a few days
he had been with Mrs. West every day
.since. He told of their frequent carousals
and of her despondency at times. She
wanted to change her life and he agreed
to help her. He gave her money and en
gaged rooms for her at 1229 Washington
street. She talked much of Suicide and
made several attempts, one of which he
prevented. Relating what occurred in the
.Phoenix Hotel, Quigley said:
"I suggested that we each commit sui
cide. Then 1 said I wasn't strong enough
to do it.
" "Would you let me kill you?" she asked
me. I said I would.
" 'Order another drink,' I said, 'while I
write a note.' Then we drank and wrote
the notes. 1 lay down on a bed, closed my
eyes and finally fell asleep, expecting
never to awaken. I was aroused by a
shot, raised up and saw her lying there
dead. She had carried out only a part of
:he agreement."
IKBIGATIONISTS SEJSTD
PRESIDENT A- PROTEST
Urgent" Appeal Made That Federal
Government Continue Reclama- ''Â¦
} tion of Arid Lands.
"-LOS ' ANGELES, Nov. 18.â The execu
tive committee of the Southern California
section of the National Irrigation Asso
ciation held a meeting to-day and formu
lated a telegram of .protest which was
sent to President Roosevelt. ;'
The telegram calls V the President's at
tention to a report sent out from Wash
ington to the erfect that he would.' recom
mend to Congress a line of action for the
reclamation of the arid- lands which will
have the effect of .Â¦ :â¢ intrusting ' to the
States, instead of the â¢ agents of the ; Fed
eral Government, the systematic develop
ment of : the plans for â¢ irrigation - works."
The committee ' represents that â¢ such a
policy would be a serious error and a
death blow to the national- irrigation
movement, or an era of home building on
the' public ; domain. The telegram also
calls the President's attention to his let
ter of November, 16, 1900, to : the National
Irrigation Congress at Chicago, "which
crystalized the sentiment' dominating
that convention that the reclamation of
the arid lands must be kept . absolutely
within the control of the National Gov
ernment."

his gun ready and with a quick shot suc

ANGRY CO-EDS
DISPLAY WRATH
Fair Maids at University
of Washington Are
Aggrieved.
. Criticism of the President
Stirs Up a Mess of
Trouble.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 18.â There is a
strong undercurrent of excitement at the
University of Washington, growing out of
remarkable events of the past week.
President Graves and the fair co-eds of
the two upper classes have had a sharp
clash, with some sensational features. A
climax was reached last Thursday 'even
ing when fifty of the girls, armed witll
brooms and dlshpans, paraded the campus
at the university, voicing loudly their
wrath at the president of the institution.
The row originated over a fight concern
ing the janitorship and the condition of
the girls' rooms. President Graves finally
decided upon a personal investigation.
Every apartment was visited ana the
wrath of the university executive grew
apace. At that time of the morning most
of the girls had not swept and tidied up
their rooms. It is stated that they are in
the habit of taking a hurried breakfast
and rushing to their classes, many doing^
their housekeeping in the afternoon, or at
night. Consequently the majority of the
rooms were in all stages of disorder.
President Graves completed his tour and"
then left with an ominous frown. That
night an indignation meeting was held.
President Graves, hearing of this meeting,
determined to be present. It was scant
courtesy that he received, however. No
chair was offered him and he was obliged
to stand while the young ladies, led by
Miss Gardiner and Miss Dodson, two up
per class women, showered upon him
wrathful statements and told him in plain
words what they thought.
It is said that at the meeting of the
Board of Regents Thursday last the presi
dent reported that the authorities in
I charge of the girls' dormitory were care
l less and inefficient and recommended their
removal.

Enraged by Action of a Hunter, Who
Mistakes a Redskin for a
Deer.
MARINETTE. Wis., Xov. 18.â It is
learned from Superintendent John Burke
of the Pcshtigo Lumber Company ' that
there is great excitement among the In
dians on the headwaters of the Eagle

County, over the supposed killing of an
Indian.
Charles Keshlna, one of the best known
Indians in that part of the country, ap
peared at one of the Peshtigo Company's
camps on Saturday and said that his
brother braves were aroused over the dis
appearance of a member of the tribe and
declared that he had been killed by some
unknown white hunter, who mistook him
for a deer. The Indians are searching
everywhere for the body, and if it be
found it may go hard with some of the
white hunters ip that locality.

Water-Front Notes.
Captain Thomas of the Afon Alaw has
been dangerously ill with asthma and
bronchitis. Ha was taken to St. Mary's
Hospital, where Dr. G. Childs Mac Do
nald looked after him. Yesterday he was
able to be around the front, but is still
far from being a well man, and the doctor
did not want him to leave the hospital.
His ship is to dock to-morrow, however,
and nothing could keep the captain in
bed.
The revenue cuttef Bear arrived from
Comox, B. C, via Port Angeles, late Sun
day night. She brings no news, as all the
Information he had as regards the Arctic
and the gold fields Captain Tuttle gave
the Sound reporters. The chances are
that from here the Bear will go to Coro
nado, where she will be stripped and dried
out, as she was two years ago. In that
event both officers and crew will live
ashore and the vesse! will be given a
thorough chance to recuperate. Wind
sails will be put into the holds and the
vessel got as near high and dry as possi
ble, and next year Uncle Sam will make
a saving of nearly 20 per cent in the
Bear's coal bill. A hotter boat for Arctic
work was never built, but unless dried out
every other year she gets loggy and loses
her speed.
The Pacific Mall Company's Newport
sailed for Panama and way ports yester
day. She did not carry many passengers,
but had a large general cargo foe Central
America.
John Samuelson was treated at the Har
bor Hospital for a lacerated wound of the
scalp yesterday. He was hurt in an ele
vator accident on Mission street and it
is feared that his skull may be fractured.
He lives at 2211 Taylor street.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda will be due from Hawaii to-day.
The chances are that she will get in early

BOOKS OF DEFAULTING
SECRETARY ARE MISSING
Isadore Less Bemoves Evidence of
His Guilt Before He Left the
City.
Isadore Less, the defaulting secretary
of the Barbers' Union, is still missing
and the members of his organization are
busily engaged trying to ascertain the ex
tent of his defalcation. A meeting of the
union was held last evening and an in
vestigation was held. The books of the
absent secretary were missing and it was
impossible to learn the amount ho had
taken. Mr. DonneHy, who assisted him
as secretary, notified the union that all
the books were on hand last Saturday
evening. It is now believed that Less de
stroyed them to hide his guilt.
As was stated in The Call, Less was in
duty bound to send a per capita tax of
$250 a month to the International Barbers"
Union, Cleveland, Ohio. It is charged
that the secretary failed to do so. The
local union must now wait until they
learn from the parent organization how
much it has received from Less within
the past few months. The entire matter
was turned over to the trustees of the
Journeymen Barbers' Union No. 148. and
they will report to the main body on Mon
day evening next. The union will not
lose by Less' defalcation, as he was under
bonds. The Fidelity Insurance Company
was his surety.

DECIDES SUIT ARISING
FROM DUNHAM MURDERS
Supreme Court Holds That Lower
Court Had No Jurisdiction Over
Escaped Criminal.
The details of the horrible murders com
mitted by James C. Dunham near San
Jose in 1896 were rehearsed in a decision
rendered by the Supreme Court yesterday
in regard to a suit for damages instituted
by the parents of Minnie Shesler, who
was one of the victims of the escaped
criminal.
The lower court decla! Ed that Dunham's
receiver, Samuei W. Boring, could recover
$8000, the amount of two notes given the
murderer by A. C. ami H. S. Penniman.
The Sheslers had previously been award
ed this sum for dan;ages. The Superior
Court maintained that service had been
made on Dunham by publication. The
Pennimans claimed that no jurisdiction
had been obtained over him by the court.
This plea is upheld by the Supreme
Court and the notes will probably go un
paid-. Accordingly the damages awarded
the parents of Minnie Shesler will also
remain unnnUi until Punnnm returns, an
event to which they cannot look forwaru
with any great degree of hope.
DIRECTORS ARE READY
TO BUY OLD EXCHANGE
Vote of "testerday Insures Erection
of Splendid Building on Cali

The directors of the Merchants* Ex
change voted yesterday to purchase the
building and site on California and
T,oidesdorff streets occupied by the old
Merchants' Exchange and the San Fran
cisco Produce Exchange. An option has
been held on this property for some
months at the agreed price of $300,000. An
option has also been held on the property
immediately adjoining in the rear and
running through from Leidesdorff street
to Montgomery.
The 'directors did net reach considera
tion of the purchase of that yesterday,
but it Is about certain that at least the
rear of the propertyâ that part on which
â¢was the old Stock Exchangeâ will be se
cured. The price of that is $50,000. The
action yesterday makes it certain that
there will be erected' a handsome building
on the site of the old Merchants' Ex

Alliance Gives a Dance.
The St. Patrick's Mutual Alliance last

meeting of the association. "I^efs hayÂ«
something that everybody can have some
of," was the unanimous answer. As a
consequence St. Patrick's Mutual Alliance
last evening gave In K. R. B. Hall, 113?
Mission street, one of the most successful
social entertainments the organlzatior
has ever fathered. There was instrumen

Supervisors Favor Acquisi
tion of Street Roads and
Water Works.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print ordinances declaring that
the public Interest and necessity demand
the acquisition by the city of water
works, sewer system, hospital building,
library site and street railroads. The
first ordinance on the subject follows:
Whereo. the Board of Supervisors has,
through the City Engineer, procured plans ana
estimates of the actual coat of the original con
struction and completion by the city of water
Whereas, the board has solicited and con
sidered offers for the sale to the city of ex
isting water works. . Â¦ .
Whereas, the board is satisfied from its in
vestigations in the premises that the Visitation
Water Company has not at present sufficient
â¢water to supply the city. Be It ordained:
That the publlo interest and necessity de
mand the acquisition, construction and com
pletion by the city Of water works, and the
plans- and estimates of the coat of obtaining
a sufficient and permanent supply of gooa,
pure water from the Tuolumne River are here
by selected as the ones to be submitted to the
people for their approval.
Comte objected to a portion of the ordi
nance as originally drafted which stated
that the water of the Spring Valley plane
was rapidly diminishing and becoming
impure. Comte held that this was merely
guesswork, and the Supervisors should
not go outside of their way to make a
statement which he did not believe was
founded on fact.
"Such action by the board will certainly
hurt the stock and do Injury to the stock
holders and should be left to political
conventions," said Comte.
Reed referred to City Engineer
Gunsky's report that the Spring Valley
supply would run dry in five years and
pointed to the fact that the company was
now using water from Point Lobos Creek,
which, it is said, is contaminated and had
not been included in the cost of the plant
in fixing the last water rates.
Cteary-Street Boad Proposition.
The ordinance on the street^ailroad
proposition follows:
Whereas," the Board* of Supervls6rs is satis
fled that the city and county can, with great
advantage take over the Geary-street railroad
at the expiration of Its franchise and together
with the extensions thereof planned by the
City Engineer operate the same as a municipal
â¢ railroad; therefore be It ordained, That the
i public Interest demands the acquisition of
street railroads, and the plans and estimates
Â¦ of the cost of reconstructing the Geary-streeet
railroad and constructing the extensions there
' of, with the exception of unessential changes
1 in the route suggested, are hereby selected as
' the ones to be submitted to the people for their
ipproval.
An ordinance was also passed to print
leclaring that public Interest demands
he construction of a sewer system, hos
pital building, the acquisition of a site
or a new school building, nineteen school
juildings and additions to six school
julldlngs, the acquisition of two blocks
jounded by Dolores, Church, Eighteenth
md Twentieth streets for a park, the
3lock bounded by Seventh, Folsom. Sher
man and Harrison streets for a play
ground and block bounded by Washing
ton, Oough, Sacramento and Laguna
streets for a park.
Site for Carnegie Library.
The ordinance that the Mechanics' Pa
vilion property be acquired for the Car
negie Library was also adopted.
Brandenstein urged the selection of the
Fair site on the ground that it was more
central and would effect a saving of $400,
900. A motion to substitute the site for
the Mechanics' Pavilion property was
lost.
A resolution declaring that public Inter
est requires that Outside Land blocks
Nos. 84, 169. 194, 271, 296, 368 and 393 and I
be acquired for extending Golden Gate
Park northerly between Thirteenth and
Fourteenth avenues so as to connect with
the Presidio reservation was adopted.
The Board of Works was requested to
furnish an appraisement of the blocks
named and also of the sites and buildings
recommended for flrehouses by the Fire
Commission.
Spring Valley Company Objects.
The Spring Valley Water Company filed
a communication in response to a resolu
tion soliciting an offer to sell its system
to the city, stating that it is ready and
willing as soon as the charter provisions
have been complied with to submit an
offer for the sale of its works. The com
pany, however, makes technical objec
tions to the board's method of procedure.
In its communication the company quotes
the charter and holds that the estimates
on the Tuolumne River supply furnished
by the city engineer are designated by
him as a progress report, and until the
actual cost is determined the Board of
Supervisors cannot legally submit a prop
osition to the electors. The communica
tion says:
In securing estimates of the original coat of
the construction and completion of water works
by the city and county the Supervisors must
procure and place on file plans and estimates
of the cost of obtaining water from all of the
several available sources. The charter inti
mates clearly that the purpose of soliciting
offers from the existing corporations is to aid
the electors in determining upon what selec
tion If any, shall be made. In this sense the
bids or offers of the existing corporations are
not only competitive aa between themselves,
but as against the original construction, and
it is therefore provided that the estimates
shall be of the actual cost, otherwise there
could be no competitive bid based upon a suf
ficient and intelligent premise. Only one source
has been estimated in the progress report,
whereas the charter requires estimates of ail
the available sources.
Condemns Lobos Creek Water.
A resolution condemning the action of
the Spring Valley Water Company in fur
nishing the people with contaminated wa
ter from I^obos creek and ordering the
Board of Works to make an analysis of
the water to determine the degree of dan
ger from it 3 use was referred to the
Health Committee.
The City Attorney was asked for an
opinion whether the Supervisors have the
power to fix the wages of employes in the
park or on any public utility.
The Fair heirs submitted a proposal to
sell the block bounded by California, Sac
ramento, Powell and- Mason streets/ for
use as a library site, for the sum 0r*250,
00. They agree to accept in payment
bonds issued by the city. The offer was
referred to the Educational Committee.
Th 6 communication from the San Fran
cisco Board of Trade indorsing the peti
tion of the North Central Improvement
Association regarding the necessity of
constructing a tunnel through Telegraph
Hill, thereby continuing Montgomery
street from Jackson to Lombard, was re
ferred to the Finance Committee.
Offers Water Supplies to City.
Jay E. Russell submitted a proposition
to sell to the city water, lights, electric
power, or to furnish the same. Russell
states that he owns 860 acres of land in
Placer and El Dorado counties, on both
sides of the American River. The cost of
the water works is fixed at $3,946,379; cost
of electric works for light and power,
$634,184; electric road, 118 miles long, $754,
69; total for the three utilities, $5,335,232.
The proposal of Russell ti. Dunn to sell
the properties of the Visitacion, Water
Company and the Giant Gap Water Com
pany to the city and county for the sum
of $2,600,000 was referred to the Public
Utilities Committee.
M. C. Taylor also submitted an offer to
bring two lines of forty-four-inch pipe
with water from the north and middle
Yuba rivers, which will deliver in the city
47.852,000 gallons dally, for $20,000,000, or
three lines of pipe, carrying 71.852,000 gal
lons daily, for 126,288,390. Taylor says he
will include in the offer 3000 electric horse
power, which will light the city and its
public buildings and do its pumping. Tay
lor says he owns an immense body of iron
ore close to the pipe line and will agree to
erect blast furnaces, steel works and the
machinery to manufacture plate In this
city, which could be put on a permanent
basis for manufacturing plate for ship
building. _______________

In addition to the sewers recommended

the repair of the Brannan-street sewer
and the replacement of the Baker-street
sewer from Chestnut street to the bay is
recommended. City Engineer Grunsky
says in his report:
I desire to reaffirm the conclusions presented
to the Board of Supervisors of the city and

system of sewage for this city prepared by me
. with Marsden Manson and C. S. Tilton as
associate engineers, which report bears date
October 21, 1899. . ,_v , . ..
Since the cost estimates submitted in the
report of 1599 were made prices and materials
have advancÂ«i. A revision of the original cost
! estimate haÂ« therefore become necessary. On
! the basi6 of this revision and including the
additional work (mentioned elsewhere) the cost
of the proposed sewer system. Including an
â¢ allowance of about 15 per cent for engineering
'< supervision contingent and incidental expenses,
â¢ and $150,000 for real e3tate, rights of way, open

BOXING LICENSE
Supervisor Reed Presents
Ordinance on the
Subject.
New Bill Prohibiting All
Freak Advertising Is
Defeated.
Supervisor Reed Introduced an ordi
nance at yesterday's meeting of the board
to increase the license to be paid for box
ing exhibitions from $1200 to $5000 per an
num. Reed stated that the three athletic
clubs had paid in $3600 this year, and he
believed that they had effected a combi
nation. He referred to the enormous re
ceipts of the last exhibition as a reason
for raising the license. The. bill was re
ferred to the Police Committee.
The bill prohibiting freak advertising
on the public streets was defeated, only
nine votes being cast in its favor.
Brandenstein contended that the original
bill on the subject, now In force, was not
invalid simply because the Police courts
had adjudged unconstitutional one sec
tion, which discriminated in favor of be
nevolent organizations. Reed held that
the new bill eliminated the alleged invalid
section and so made the remainder legal.
The ordinance providing for the appoint
ment of a Board of Examining Engineers
to iicense stationary engineers was re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee, to
draft an ordinance placing the exercise of
the function contemplated in the hands
of the Board of Works.
The protest of the Rev. D. O. Sullivan
and property owners against the purchase
of Bay View Farm for use as a pest
house site was referred to the Health
Committee, which will visit the vicinity
and inspect other suitable sites.
The Painters' District Council filed a
copy of resolutions adopted by the organ
ization petitioning Cqngress to renew the
Chinese exclusion law. The resolution
was signed by J. Tuites, president, and
Walter Campbell, secretary.
The claim of the Stetson-Renner Dray
age Company for $119 81 damages for the
spilling of three puncheons of wine by a
mob during the strike was rejected, as
the question is one for Judicial determina
tion.
The Bay City Athletic Club was grant*
ed a permit to hold an amateur boxinjl
exhibition on Thursday, November 21^
1901.
The resolution requesting the Fire Com
mission to suitably reward the heroic act
of Frank Gorman in rescuing Miss Nellie
Healey from a fire was adopted.

SAN JOSE, Nov. 18.â A strong delega
tion will represent San Jose and Santa
Clara at the Chinese exclusion convention
at San Francisco next Thursday. A cau
cus has already been held, at which most
of the delegates were present. After a
thorough discussion, it was the opinion
that tne present law was not properly
enforced. They believe that Mexico and
British Columbia, as well as the United
States, should close their ports to the
Chinese, as, besides the coolies affecting
the workmen of those places, many/ come '
over the borders to the United States.

FISH COMMISSION IS
FOUND TO HAVE A HEAKT
Chief Deputy Vogelsang Surrenders
Ducks Destined for a Dinner
Given by Sportsman.
The Fish Commission deputies almost
cheated A. Heilbron ana his friends out of
a dinner on canvasb.ack duck last night.
When strong representations had been
made to Chief Deputy Vogelsang he re
lented, and the promised feast was al
lowed to materialize.
Mr. Heilbron went on a shooting trip
Saturday, and arrived home the proud
possessor of six choice birds. He invited
some of his friends to repair to his hotel
last night and rejoice with him over his
achievement. Meanwhile he sent the
ducks to A. Fodera, a poultry dealer, to
be cleaned. Fodera then had on his hands
a supply of about seytnty ducks, in vio
lation of the bag limit law, which allows
one person to have buL fifty of the birds
at one time.
Deputies Kercheval and Walters were
sent after the offender. The supply was
Â«eized and Fedora v. - as arrested. He
stated that six of the ducks belonged to
Mr Heilbron, who when he heard of
Â¦what had taken place appeared and heart
ily indorsed this statement.
Chief Deputy Vogelsang was touched
by the appeals and finally handed over
the ducks. This is the first arrest under
the bag limit law so fur as ducks are con
cerned. â¢ _
Cigar-Smuggler Caught.
Adolphus H. Floris, fireman on the San
Bias, stowed away forty cigars in his
stockings last Sunday and tried to walk
ashore with them, but was intercepted
by a customs inspector and arrested on a
charge of smuggling.
M'KENZIE MAY
BE AGAIN CITED
Judge Maguire's Argu
ment Goes Beyond
Expectation.
Lawyers Sum Up Cases Be
fore Circuit Court of
Appeals.
m .
Alexander , McKenzle may be cited to
appear again before the Circuit Court of
Appeals and tell what he knows about
disobeyed writs, receiverships, arrests
and contempts of court. Two charges
still., hold against him and if Judge
Maguire, representing ex-Congressman
Geary, has stated facts in his argument
for the exculpation of the latter, Amicus
Curiae Pillsbury may find it necessary to
bring 'Â¦ the front and moving of all the j
home troubles into court. .
Argument ruled with a high hand be- t
fore Judges Morrow, Gilbert and Ross |
yesterday morning and . afternoon. * All i
â¢ testimony taking in the Nome contempt |
cases had been concluded and the court
had set aside, the day for the attorneys i
to state their cases. Sharp upon the hour
all concerned appeared and the talking
began. â¢>Â¦-â¢-â¢ Â¦ ' '
Francis J. Heney, associate counsel for
Judge Noyes, properly arrayed for the
pecasion, opened the game. He prayed
for a continuance for ninety days, or, if
the court would grant its sanction to it,
some six months. He read a* long affi
davit, mentioning a bakers dozen of wit
nesses whose depositions he wanted and
whose testimony he said was necessary
for . his client. This created consterna
tion among the Government forces. Mr.
Pillsbury was willing to waive almost
anything to bring the case to a conclu
sion. . Heney anxiously desired the con
tinuance. District Attorney Wood thought
a continuance would work to his good.
Thomas J. Geary ' was satisfied to rest
on the evidence. The court said it would
decide at 2 o'clock, so a recess was taken.
?% . Court Is Willing.
At 2 o'clock the court, through Judge
Gilbert, announced that it was willing
to grant the continuance as far as Re
spondent Noyes was concerned. Amicu3
Curiae Pillsbury was not of the same I
opinion, 'so he waived every point at j
which respondents showed a sign of cavil.
He was willing to admit that all the wit
nesses would testify Just Â¦ as Attorney
Heney in his affidavit said they would.
This was a setback to the respondents
and so the court ordered the arguments
to proceed. . . -
With a clear, concise statement of facts,
without circumlocution or waste of time,
Pillsbury produced a skeleton argument
and rested upon it absolutely. His con- I
elusion 'was: ' .
Upon what theory can the facts be ex
plained? There must have been a' community
of interest between Judge Noyes and McKen- |
zie. From these facts which I have stated I
there can be but one conclusion, that these
acts of Judge Noyes were done from an im- >
proper motive. That these receiverships were
to *be made and that McKenzie w,as to be the
receiver is evidenced by the facts. They can
be explained by no other theory than that of
common interest and improper motive.
McKenzie Is Sacrificed.
Then came Judge Maguire in behalf of
Respondent Geary. His argument was not
finished when the afternoon session closed
and will be continued this morning. Ma
guire sacrificed McKenzie for the sake of
Geary, who was his attorney. The amicus
curiae and others have been looking for
McKenzie for some time, but sickness has
been alleged for the reason of his non
appearance. Now Magulre comes to tho
front and shifts the burden of responsi- |
bility from Geary to McKenzie. "We will
see about that," says the amicus curiae,
and before many days have passed Mc-
Kenzie may be cited 'to appear and tell
his own story. Maguire's argument for
Geary was based on the ground 1 that the
attorney's counsel and advice was honest
ly given and ignored completely by the
client. v . . -
The arguments will continue this morn
ing. They may. and may not, be finished
to-day. Â¦'Â¦:.- Â¦ - â¢ â¢_ Â¦

DEATH SUDDENLY
CALLS ATTORNEY
Henry N. Clement Ex
pires Unexpectedly
at His Home.
Played a Prominent Part in
Framing the New '
Charter.
Henry N. Clement, the well known at
torney, died suddenly Sunday morning be
fore 11 o'clock at hia late residence. 687
Guerrero street. The Inevitable summon*
came as he was reading his morning pa
per. Death was due to heart disease,
from which he had suffered for some
time.
He was born in Bellefontalne, Ohio.
May 3, 1841. His father, who had attained
an enviable reputation as a scholar, died
while he was a child. Forced to com
mence life without the gruiding hand of a
father to assist htm. Clement worked hia
way through college, graduating from the
University of Michigan in 1566. After his
graduation he commenced the study of
law. In 1867 he married Miss Mary Hull
of Sharon, Pa., and a few years subse
quently he came to California. Since hia
arrival in the State his career as a public
spirited citizen is well known. He played
a very prominent part in the work that
gave to this city a new charter, being a
member of the Board of Freeholders
which framed that instrument.
He was an earnest advocate of civil
service reform and acted as chairman of
the committee which drew up that sec
tion of the charter. He was a prominent
member of the Bohemian Club and wai
a member of the board of directors of the
Associated Charities. Always a loyal Re
publican, he took a prominent part in
all that he judged to be for the best in
terest of his party. He was president of
the board of trustees of the Second Uni
tarian Church.
He leaves a daughter, Ada, and two
sons. Walter O. and Jablsh Clement. For
several years the deceased was in part
nership with his son Jabish. while Waiter
has been engaged in mining in the south
ern part of the State.
Arrangements for the funeral have- not
yet been completed.

POLICE CHIEF
TO BE NAMED
IMMEDIATELY
Captain Wittman May Be
Chosen to Fill the
Vacancy.
Commissioners Desire to Al
lay FeeliDg of Unrest in
the Department
Views Frankly Interchanged at an
Important Conference With
Mayor Phelan Yesterday
Afternoon.
A rerular session of the Board of Po
lice Commissioners will be held this even
ing- An executive officer of the depart
ment to fill the vacancy caused by the
death of Colonel Sullivan will be elected.
There was a conference of the Commis
sioners and Mayor Phelan yesterday aft
ernoon. At {he conference there was a
frank and vigorous interchange of opin
ion.
It is said that three of the Commis
sioners maintain that the board is in
power to perform and not to shirk the
plain public duties prescribed by the
charter. They hold that the important
duty cf electing a Chief of Police now
devolves upon the board, and that failure
to exercise the prerogative conferred by
the charter would be little short of neg
lect of public duty. Tremendous pressure
has been brought to bear on the Com
missioners to prevent them from taking
decisive action, or at least to persuade
them that nothing should be done toward
tilling the vacancy until the Mayor-elect
is inducted into office.
The Commissioners know that there is
a feeling of unrest in the department and
are apprehensive that it will not be al
layed until an executive officer is chosen,
hence thert 1c a vigorous sentiment in
favor of prompt measures to preserve effi
ciency and harmony in the force.
It is quite well known that Mayor-elect
Schmitx 1b in favor of the election of Jere
Dinar.. Schmitz and Dinan were boys to
gether in Watsonville and entertain one
for the other the warmest sentiments of
friendship. Others than the Mayor-elect
believe that Dlnan would make a good
Chief. Captain Dunlevy is said to be the
choice of men prominent in the Union
Labor party. Captain Wittman is held
in high favor by the conservative classes
of the city. The election of Captain Witt
man will, no doubt, take place to-night.
Captain JEsola is backed by certain influ
ences, but the chances of his selection arc
Blender. It is highly probable that the
merits of the several aspirants will be
considered at the session this evening,
and in the balloting after the discussion a
Chief wfl! he chosen.
COLLINS ASKS NEW
TRIAL FOB DLMMICK
Alleges That the Indictment Failed
to Charge the Commission of
a Crime.
Walter K. Dimmick, ex-chief clerk of
the Mint, appeared in the United States
District Court yesterday morning for sen
tence upon a conviction had last week on
three counts "of an indictment charging
him with having feloniously failed to de
posit Government funds in accordance
with the requirements of the Secretary of
the Treasury. George D. Collins, his at
torney, made two motions, one for a new
trial and the other for arrest of judg
ment.
The chief and apparently the most ef
fective ground for the motion in arrest of
judgment was the contention that Dim
mick had been convicted of something
that was not a crime. In other words,
Mr. Collins argued that the indictment
on one of the counts of which the defend
ant had been convicted charged that
Dimmick had failed to deposit money on
December SI, the last day of the quarter,
as required by the treasury regulations.
The money was alleged in the indictment
to have been received by Dimmick on
December 11. but the Indictment failed to
allege that Dimmick had not paid it into
the Sub-Treasury between December 11
and December 31. If he had paid it be
tween those dates no offense was com
mitted and neither the indictment nor the
evidence for the prosecution showed that
he bad not paid the money between those
dates.
After a reply by Bert Soh'.esin^er of
special counsel for the Government, the
court tooik the matter under advisement.
Kahler Adjudged Innocent.
The preliminary hearing of trie felony
embezzlement charge against H. S. Kah
ler. president of the Imperial Ginger Ale
and Seltzer Water Company, preferred by
R. S. MosFman a few days apo, was held
yesterday afternoon before Police Judge
A. J. Fritz. Mossman .was the only wit
ness called by the prosecution, and it was
fo evident from his testimony that no
crime was committed by Mr. Kahler that
Judge Fritz immediately granted a mo
tion to dismiss, made by McClellan & Mc-
Clellan. attorneys for Mr. Kahler. It
transpired that Mossman purchased 300
shares of the capital stock of the Impe
rial Ginger Ale and Seltzer Water Com
pany and thereupon obtained employment
with the company. The statement "which
has heretofore been made that the com
pany has gone out of business proved un
true, as the plant has been running con
tinuously since July 15, 1901. when busi
ness was commenced. - -â¢ Â¦- .

Thomas H. Williams Jr.
to Carry Out a
Novel Scheme.
Thomas H. Williams Jr., president of
tlr? new California Jockey Club, is about
to try an experiment in preparing horses
for the track. Mr. Williams has always
been an enthusiast in these matters and
the friends who are aware of his plan
are 'looking forward to Its outcome with
deep interest.
The well-known horseman Is a believer
in the theory that horses should not be
put on the track until they have reached
their maturity. He believes that two-

The two cantons tormed three sides of
I a hollow square after the candidates for

tain Kornfeeck through a . line of
uncovered patriarchs to the commander
and other superior officers, who formed
I the other line of the square. The ladles
[ were then required to lave their hands in
pure water that they might receive the
jewels with clean hands, after which they
were escorted to the altar, where a sol
emn obligation was administered to them.
At the close the patriarchs with uplifted
swords advanced one step and in chorus
exclaimed in solemn tones, "Remember
the oath."
The ladies were addressed by the com
mander on the subject of the benevolent
work In which they are engaged, who re

enough to do themselves justice.
Mr. Williams intends buying a number
of yearlings and sending them to Ore
gon. It is his intention to allow the
horses to browse on the bunch grass
and gain strength roaming over the coun
try- H e will not permit them to grow
wild nor will he have them trained. He
will simply have them ridden from time
to time for the purpose of accustoming
them to the work they will do In future
In speaking about the matter yesterday,
Mr. Williams said:
John E. Lewis and myself expfect to ko to
Oregon next summer and buy a number of
yearlings. We will pick out what we think
will develop Into goud horses and then send
them to Klamath. or some other county to
develop and strengthen until they are three
or four years old.
I have a theory that a horse is not at his
best until he reaches the age of four years
cannot train babies, nor can you teach a
colt as much as you could an old horse. The
trouble out here is that the people want early
racing and we have to eive It to them
These young horses will run over th? country
for two or three years, feeding on the bunch
grass that Is so abundant and gaining strength
and stamina. AYe will not allow them to hs
come wi!d. We will have them ridden from
time to time so they will be accustomed to
their future work. There are rolllnc plains
in the State of Oregon. The horses will de
velop every muscle In their bodies, racing at
free will. I have known horses to travel forty
and fifty miles a day in search of water or
reed. TheFe horses will undoubtedly do the
same and thus attain the stamina that every
racehorse thould Dossess. The water In that
country Is not Ice cold.* There are a number
of springs up there and the animals will have
; plenty to drink.

In the early day 8 our mustangs were brought

Speakers.
The , members of the . Merchants' Asso
ciation and invited guests sat at their
annual dinner in > the Palace Hotel last
evening, surrounded by enough tokens of
the autumn to give the scene the appear
ance of a harvest festival. The bright
hues 'of autumn leaves and flowers were
supplemented by hundreds of red-backed
menu cards on the snowy tables. On the
candelabra bright red and yellow shades
alternated. : Grapes, and other fruits,
heaped jup Â¦in j profusion -in Â¦ front -of the
presiding officer's place at table, and the
other \ fruitage of autumn, employed in
the fashioning of mural designs, added to
the illusion and lent suggestlveness to the
occasion.' â¢ . â¢ s â¢ : ..
Over the alcove in which, on a raised
platform, sat President Symmes and the
guests of honor, facing the long rows of
tables that extended the width of the
banquet 'hall, American flags were fes
tooned. '-. So many accessories were em
ployed that the general effect was - ex
tremely brilliant, far surpassing any pre- j
vious banqueting scene in which the as- i
sociation has been concerned. '
Upon the platform in the alcove there
were three tables. At the one in front
were seated President Frank J. Symmes,
W. R. Wheeler, Chief Justice Beatty, Dr.
William H. Tolnian of New York, Director
Fairfax H. Wheelan, President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler of tne University of Cali- |
fornia; President David Starr Jordan of
Stanford University, ex-President F.
W. Dohrmann ana Mayor * James D. |
Phelan. At the next table were Presidents !
George W. McNear of the Merchants' Ex- j
change, George A. Newhall of the Chamber
of Commerce, A. A. Watkins of the San I
Francisco Board of Trade, Professor Carl !
Plehn of the University of California, !

bers of the Civil Service Commission of

I of the Board 01 Works.
Supervisors Were There. '
â¢ On the main floor, directly in- front of
the platform, were the members-elect of
[ the Board of Supervisors and some oth
ers. Back of them a baker's dozen of
| parallel' tables were arranged, the line
i extending to the farther end of the ban
quet hall. There were present 475 mem-
I bers of the Merchants' Association and
i guests. All the great business enterprises
! of the city were represented. Mayor-elect
I Schmitz was expected to be present and
to speak, but a dispatch was received
from him by ' Secretary Freud yesterday
afternoon/dated at Watsonville, convey
! ing the information that he would be un-
I able to attend owing to the Illness of Mrs.
i Schmitz. . ....
On the menu card the work of the asso
ciation was recounted at length.
President Symmes acted as toastmaster
and spoke at some length before he Intro
duced the speakers. He alluded to the
value of the association to the commu
nity. He said: # â¢ .*Â¦ Â¦ â¢
The association's past good service has been
I acknowledged- and there is still much for it
to : do. It has no excuse as yet for retiring
from business. â¢ We ~ stand for good govern
ment, for clean streets. and a clean City Hall
and for a j prosperous and happy people. AH
I these thlr.gs are interwoven and each helps to
bring the other. ..'.Â¦ -. â¢â¢
I Speaking of the recent . political cam
paign President Symmes Â¦ repeated the
story of the traveler who found two men
I disputing over the division of an oyster
! ana divided it by taking the oyster and
giving each a shell. That was the situa
! tion in the recent campaign. " Â¦Â¦.-
William R. Wheeler made a strong plea
for the use of San Francisco's natural
i advantages for its own good. He would
j have San Francisco's climate advertised
I by all possible means, as he regarded that
j as - a great v asset. He would also do away
I with ( Chinatown have a main intercept
ing sewer constructed of sufficient 'capac
ity Â¦to drain a ; city cf 1,000,000 or more.
' Market street should foe paved in the best
! manner possible and 'permanently to the

; ed at the gores on the north side of Mar
j ket street. *
Tolman Gives Advice.
- Dr. William H. Tolman of ", New York
gave an account of the work of the so-
I cial engineer in reconciling the differences
of employes and employers, and told what
had been done â¢by employers elsewhere
to improve the condition of the workers,
speaking .particularly of Europe. In con
! elusion he said that it is easier to form
than to reform* and that San Francisco
should take advantage of the example of

Win cake of soap and throw it away! Yet you
$ \i% pay tw^ ce *k c price of Ivory Soap for a cake
J-X-lElof "tinted toilet soap less than half as
large. Your little cake of toilet soap costs you four
times the price of Ivory, for it lasts only half as long
i and costs twice as much. No money can buy purer
or better soap than Ivory. If it came Jn dainty
paper, all scented and colored, you would pay fifteen
cents for a very small cake of it.

any circumstances the opportunity to meet so
distinguished a body of my fellow citizen* will
be to me a source of great gratification.
In the present circumstances it Is with
especial pride that I embrace the privilege of
being with you in order that I may present to
you and your association the views I have *--
always expressed through my entire campaign *
with my election, that through me the recog
nition of the wage earners of San Francisico
does not mean an Industrial or social revolu
tion, that It does not imply a destruction of
vested Interests, or the Injury of property
rights, but that It indicates that the constant
ly reiterated Imputation of the- Irrespoos
of the honest working classes Is wi'
atlon: that all elements of our comranr.it> arw
entitled to fair and equal conslderÂ»slc v
that under my administration th*
reason to hope that the relations b<
ital and labor, between employer â¢â¢. '
ployed, will be so adjusted that : -
prosperity will reign without interrupt;
this great city of ours.
In the confident expectation that through
this, our first meeting, will be Inaugurated an
era of mutual respect and confidence between
those who employ and those who are employed,
a 3ense of entire security and safety for vest
pi interests as well as for personal rights and
liberties". I am, with much appreciation. YourÂ»
vary truly, E. E. SCHMITZ.
