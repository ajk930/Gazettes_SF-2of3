GREAT precautions are being
taken by the Southern Pacific
Company officials to prevent
any possible chance of any
accident occurring to the

J. A. Fillmore has given instructions to
all agents to examine all switches under
their supervision ten minutes before the

Engine No. 1139 has been selected to haul
the PrpsidentLal train from Monterey tc
this citv. This- locomotive is of the "C.
TV." class and besides being new is one
of the bpst engines in use by the company.
The locomotive is not capable of a high
rate of speed, yet when called upon it can
make fifty miles an hour. The locomotives
of the "C. W." pattern are built with a
view to strength rather' than . to speed.
The Presidential train at no time during
the whole tour of the United States makts
fast time, the average speed being about
thirty miles an hour, that being nearly the
limit owing to the number of cars and
great weight of the train.
The following 'engineers and conductors
have been selected to take charge of the
train over their respective divisions: El
Paso to Tucson, Engineer Bruce; Tucson
to Tuma, Engineer J. C Clancy: Tuma to

But the President enjoyed himself to
day, after his own fashion. In the fore
noon he attended service at the 'Trinity
Methodist Church. He was accompanied
by Secretary Hitchccck, Mayor Hammett
â¢of El Paso and Secretary Cortelyou. .
A bull fight in Old Juarez,- Mex.. just
across the river, attracted most of tho
young men of the party. Five bulls were
killed in honor of the visitors of the Gov
ernor of Chihuahua, who came north as
the personal representative of President
Diaz. The younger members of the party
carried to the Presidential train glowing
accounts of the interesting and: pictur
esque sights witnessed In Juarez, and to
morrow the Cabinet secretaries may take
a drive through the old town, 4 but this
pleasure is, of course, denied the Presi
dent, for there is, a constitutional prohibi-.
tlon against his leaving the United States
without the sanction of .Congress.. -
Went to a Bullfight.
Devout worshipers of the Catholic faith
filled the churches and passed along the
streets counting their _ v beads, while all
about them in the principal thoroughfares
wide open games of . faro, roulette
and. Spanish monte. ' Jt was to the North
ern" visitors a most. inconsistent and in

men in their high peaked hats and som
breros heavily trimmed with silver orna
Â¦ ments, children- fluttering bright bandil

to the President arid his party, to most of
whom it was a novel sight. Â¦ ?
Â¦Members of the committee of ladles
were ushered into .the presence of the
"It is about breakfast time," said he,
"and we are tired. I think perhaps It
would be better for us to remain on the
train until this afternoon."
; Manager Fisher of the Sheldon, who
had, invited the Presidential party to be
come his guests while here, insisted that
they repair to his hotel at once, but tho
President demurred.
: Â¦ Remained in Cars.
The President firmly declined to be the
guest Â¦ of the 'Sheldon hotel in El Paso.
His train was side-tracked In a. remote
part of the town in a quiet neighborhood,
and , although the blazing sun poured
down all day on the coaches, the Presi
dent preferred the . discomfort of hot
weather to the noise, bustle and confusion
of the town. I
President Diaz of Mexico had hoped to
meet the President here and shake hands
with him "across the border, but as the
Mexican Congress is in session he could
not leave the : capital. Besides, It is
he is In poor health. He sent
a personal message to the President, how-'
"ever ,"*and" also dispatched Don' Juan Her
,nan'dez,' Commander, of the Second Mili
tary Zone of the State of Chihuahua, to
present personally his good wishes to> the
Chief Magistrate of the United States.
Governor Miguel Ahumada of Chihuahua
also traveled to El Paao to pay his re
spects, and these distinguished Mexican
officials, accompanied by General Hernan
dez's" staff in full uniform, were received
by the President" In his car at the station.
After exchanging felicitations/ the Presi
dent requested General Hernandez to con
vey to President Diaz his personal good
wish.es for the health and happiness of
President Diaz and for a continuation or
the cordial relations at present existing
between the two countries.
Diaz's Greetings.
After the service the President returned
to the train and spent the afternoon rest
ing quietly in his private car, the Olym
pia. During the afternoon he was sere
naded by a band from the City of Mex
ico, sent north with President Diaz's per
sonal representatives. President McKln
ley and President. Diaz to-day exchanged,
feiicitatious telegrams.
The choir then sangr the anthem, "Waka
the Song of Jubilee," after which the pas
tor, read the lesson of the day from tho
fifth chapter of IJatthew. Then the con
gregation united in singing the hymn,
"Jesus, Lover of My Soul," and it was
noticed that in the singing that tho
-President- joined ..as heartily as any one
present. During the delivery of the ser
mon which followed the President kept
his eyes fixed on the pastor and he gave
to each word the most earnest attentiorf.
The sermon was not a little remarkable
for Its frank statements of certain exist
ing political conditions and the need for a
remedy. . That remedy, according to the
preacher, was, "But. seek ye first tho
kingdom of God and His righteousness,
and all these things shall be added unto
you."
and that he may have a higher apprecia
tion of the vast country over which he la
called to govern. We pray thea that
thy divine grace may be- vouchsafed to
him and his Cabinet, the Superior Courts,
the Governors of the respective States
and all those who are in authority under
him." >:Â¦.-';Â¦-

twenty-four hours before the Presidential
party, on Sunday, the 12th. They ,will be

reception will be tendered Governor Nash

the President can . be prevailed upon to

be kept during the carnival. Governor
Nash' s party will be taken for a drive
about the valley- and given an Italian
breakfast at the Quito farm. ",-
The . ladies' auxiliary committee has
asked and received permission from the
management to name the person who will
present the mammoth bouquet to Presi
dent McKinley. Mrs. E. O. Smith will
probably be chosen, as it was her bright
idea that gave the carnival this feature.
She is chairman of the ladles' committee
and' has been very active in the arrange
ments for the festival.
A miniature of the battleship Ohio made
of flowers will be the offering of the Ohio
ana of this city and county to President
McKinley.- At first it was intended to
have it a float in the parade, but this has
been abandoned, and the. ship will now be
suspended between two pillars in front of
the Courthouse. The battleship will be
twelve feet long. White calla lilies will
form the base, while the detail work will
be of red and blue flowers. ,
A' contribution to the. general fund of
the carnival In the nature of a- large
check has been received from Mrs. Jane
Lathrop Stanford. The university, too,
has offered Its services la any way deemed
best by the committee to hejp make the
project a success. v .
SAN JOSE. May 5.â Santa Clara County
is ready to receive President McKlnley in
manner befitting 1 the Garden City of the
"West. Thousands upon thousands of
flowers are being plucked to do honor to
the nation's Chief Executive. A wilder
ness of blossoms will be presented on this
occasion for the delight of the city's
guestsâ a profusion such as it would be
almost impossible to gather elsewhere
than in the sunny and fertile valley of
the Santa Clara. /
Arrangements are complete. The man
agement and the committees have worked
long and hard. For nearly j[ our months
the preparation has been In;]*ogress. and
there- have been thousands *of workers,
from the school, child who has acted as
gardener, planting and training 1 the small
plot of flowers set a-side for each, one who
cared to help, to the director general,
who' has devoted his entire time to the
Carnival affairs. Many hands have done
hard work, and ' constant attention has -
made Santa Clara County's welcome the
most pretentious, In a floral way, of any
city on the President's^ route. San Jose
will provide the Californian floral exhibit
for the benefit of the Eastern visitors,
and it will cause eyes to open wide at its
magnificence.
In the parade on the morning of the
14th, when President McKlnley will ride
at the head of a procession of fifty floral
floats and hundreds of carriages deco
rated with blossoms, the idea has been
not to attempt to compete with the larger
cities in number of . organizations in line,
nor in military splendor. The results of
the fertile soil and beautiful climate,
flowers In profusion, will be the sole rea
son for the exhibit.
At a meeting yesterday of the ladles' .
auxiliary committee. Mrs. "Williams', a *
landscape gardener from near Alma, was
given charge of the decoration of I the
fountain in St. James Park. Her plans
are very extensive and will make this one
of the most beautiful features of the
floral display. Mrs. Williams has one of
the finest ferneries in the State, and sne.
intends to use her choice plants in . the
decorations. These will be arranged with
an abundance of flowers to make the cen
ter of the park a floral labyrinth.
: Mrs. Addle Frink, secretary of the com
mittee, has . already received notice of
about five hundred contributions of flow
ers for the women's work in the decora
tions. The fear that the recent rain had
injured the Carnival flower crop is . un
founded, and there will be blossoms in

PRECAUTIONS TO

McKINLEY RESTS
IN OLD EL PASO
Continued from First Page.
President and Mrs. McKInley as soon as
the members of the Davis Committee had
Â¦withdrawn. While they were waiting: at
the end of the Pullman they were photo
graphed. As the ladies withdrew, Mrs.
llcKinley appeared a-t the door, of the car
and smiled sweetly at those in the vicin
ity. She was greeted with cheers, the
lifting of hats and the waving of hand
kerchiefs. Sire threw kisses to a number
of children who were near at hand, and
the little ones seemed to appreciate this
gracious act of the first lady of the land.
Mrs. McKinley's Health.
Mrs. McKinley's health has not been
good and she Ehows plainly the effects or
tho fatiguing journey across the great
State of Texas. She is better to-day, but
at other points to the eastward the
gravest apprehension was felt for her con
dition, and her physician at one time
feared that it would be necessary for tier
to discontinue the journey. Many per
sons in the crowd .to-day noted that her
face indicated that her health ,was not
good. " They also noted the tenderness
with which the President supported her
Â¦with his arm and assisted her to and from
the seat. Alarming reports concerning
her state of health have been telegraphed
from various -points along the route.
These have been somewhat exaggerated.
It cannot be denied that she -is in a very
frail condition of health, but there has
been no decided change for better or
Â¦worse.
At New Orleans the rocking of the boat
completely upset her and for an hour, or
two she kept to her cabin, with the Presi
dent in constant and anxious attendance
upon her. At San Antonio she was in a
state of partial collapse on account of the
very warm weather and the excitement
Incident to such a trip; This morning
â¢when she went for a drive it was ob
served that she was quite- infirm. She
walked feebly and had to be supported.
Yet, it must be remembered that as long
ago as the first inauguration of President
McKinley she was in much the same con
dition and had to be supported on the
platform at the east front of the Capitol
by the President's brother, Abner Mc-
Kinley. It is hoped that she will be able
to accomplish the remainder of the jour
ney without serious indisposition. To-mor
row the Iadie3 of the party will be enter
tained in Old Juarez at a breakfast, and
it is hoped that Mrs. McKinley will be
well enough to be present. %
[~K:'~, The Southern Reception.
. I asked Secretary Hay to-night to give
me his Impressions of the reception ac
corded President McKinley in the' South
and of general conditions in the Southern
sections traversed by the Presidential
train.
"It Is a satisfaction to comply with Ths
Call's request," said he, "for it gives me
unbounded pleasure to acknowledge by
some public utterance the gratification we
all feel over the generous and hospitable
treatment we have received all along the
. line since we left Washington. We ex
pected It. and were not disappointed. The
liberality and hospitality of the Southern
people have long been proverbial in our
country. If there has been any lack of
enthusiasm at any point along the line,
it was not observable by any member of
our party. The Southern people have
learned the art of entertaining in a quiet
manner. If there has been any lack of
noisy demonstrations, it is because of this
fact. Our receptions at various points
along the route have been quiet but none
the less cordial. Business and general con
ditions are improviug In the South, and
we are happy to notÂ« it."
Postmaster General Smith said:
"Our welcome in the South has been all
that we expected. Everywhere have we
received the most kindly treatment. It
must be remembered that a vast number
of people in the South are-ppposed politi
cally to the present admmistratibn, but
It has gratified us to observe that the
Southern people have not allowed political
prejudices to influence them to any ex
"tent- .---- ... : . â¢ "â¢ -
A Steady Improvement.
"I have observed in the public prints-'
some allusions to a rather cool treatment
accorded the President and his associates
on his trip; but it must be remembered
that Southern methods are different from
those of the North. In place of the pyro
technic welcomes to which we are accus
tomed in the North, we have received in
the South receptions none the less sincere
because quietly expressed. As for gen
oral business conditions in the South and
conditions generally, they are just about
as we expected. No close observer can
fail to notice a steady improvement in
business and industrial conditions ; in the
South, slow but sure, and God speed the
day when the Southern country will be
completely regenerated and revived! Her
natural resources are abundant, her peo
ple Intelligent and industrious. There is
no reason why general prosperity
throughout the South should be retarded,
and if any act of the administration can
be an aid to the material welfare of the
Southern people, you may be sure it will
be forthcoming."

VALLEJO TRIP
Congressman Victor H.
Metcalf of the Third District
said this evening:
"It would be an excellent
thing if the President could
find- time to visit the Mare
, Island Navy Yard, for much
good would come, from such a
trip. I will leave to-morrow
for the south to meet the
President and will take the
matter up at that time. - The
great difficulty is that the
route of the President has al
ready been completed and it is
â¢ very difficult to make a
change. I have just returned
from Vallejo and the people
of that city are much inter
ested. They hope that at least
the Secretary of the Navy will
visit the navy yard. I hope to
he able to have a portion of the
Presidential party, if not the
President, go to Vallejo."

the Santa Fe took charge of It. The train
was on schedule time and all aboard were
well.
Governor Nash was met here by Major

RAILWAY ORGANIZATION
Brotherhood of Trainmen Do Not
Favor the Pacific Coast
Movement.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., May 5.â The at\
tempt which Is being made on. the Pacific
Coast to rear up a new organization of
railway employes over the ashes of the
old American Railway Union and to in
clude in its membership members of all
railway unions in the country is likely to
receive vigorous treatment at the hands
of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen,
which opens its fifth biennial convention
to-morrow. National officers of the train
men who are <n the city do not hesitate
to say that they see in the new organiza
tion a menace to their own union, and de
nounce the attempt to build It up as a
movement to disrupt their own organiza
tion. It is not believed by the officers
that Eugene V. Debs Is behlrtu the move
ment, but from information which Is" in
their possession the Grand Lodge officers
say that the principles' of the new union
are almost the Fame as those of the Amer
ican Railway Union.
P. H. Morrissey, grand master of the
Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, said
to-night In regard to the new organiza
tion:
"It will meet with no favor at the hands
of our organization. What action our
convention will take upon it or whether
it will take any action I cannot say. That
is a question for the convention to take
up and decide for Itself. . The new organ
ization has gained no members as far as
I know in the East, and those it has are
confined to the Pacific Coast. There is
no room for it at the present time."

was released on bonds to-night.
The fire was fraught with an incident of
the most distressing character. The .little
2-year-old daughter of Christiansen, who
lived on the third floor, was terribly
burned, her left arm and her face being
roasted. Her lather, a follower of Dr.
Dowie, refused to allow the little one to
have medical attention and fought des
perately when she was taken from him.
He clung to the burned arm of the child
and part of the flesh was torn from the
member. When finally the police forced
him to give up the little one he cursed
them and prayed that they might be pun
ished for subjecting his child to the world
ly science of medicine. The father was
knocked down by some person in the
crowd and barely escaped lynching. He
was arrested. ?.
The expectation of the War Department
is that all the volunteers now in the Phil
ippines will have left the islands by tho
end of June, leaving only the regulars on
duty there. Following the departure a*
volunteers will come the regulars who
were sent to Manila in 1898 just after the
outbreak of the war, and. their movement
home will continue until the force is re
duced .to approximately 40,000 men.
WASHINGTON, May 5.â After a careful
consideration of the situation the admin

In the Philippines to 40,000. The opinion
prevails here that this number will be

ner that has been'shown in the past few
months the force may be reduced still

SERIOUS CLASH

The Colombian Government officials,
concluded Mallet, are experiencing very
strong precautions in order to prevent
news affecting themselves from leaking
out of the country. Advices from other
sources report heavy lighting last week
in the interior near Squavinilla and Barin
quilla. They repulsed an attack of the
Government forces, with heavy losses on
both sides.
The Colombian Government has taken
the most strict precautions to guard the
more Important towns of the country, and
especially Panama, which is considered
to be perfectly safe. In spite of the
strong garrisons, however, the rebels oc
casionally manage to get near enough to
the towns to inflict damage by sniping.
No organized attack has been made dur
ing the past two months.
The country Is altogether unsettled in
consequence of .the continuation of the
struggle. Business Is paralyzed, as the
merchants are afraid to trade under the
present conditions. Exchange on London
is at 130. and on New York it is 140. The
people in the interior of the country are
suffering from the trade stagnation.

"I know of no" State in which the Chris

proportion to the population there are

"There is a message I would bring to
you to-night â a message of Christian en

message is one of fellowship and brother
ly love, is one of union in our love for
Jesus Christ. , and of loyalty to our own
church and denomination. If this feeling
Is stronger than it was twenty years ago,
let us thank God for Christian endeavor.
I can say this without flattery to myself,
for this is not your movement; It is not
my movement: it Is God's work.
"I do not think that we have yet comÂ©
to the zenith of our ambitions. God has
much for us yet to do. Is it not good for
us all to be here together? "We do not
know nor do we care for a. short time to
what denomination each, belongs. "We feel
that there is one name" above all other
names. We unite in saying that -we will
do whatever Christ would have us do."

An array of figures and statistics is
made to show that South America "offers
a field for expansion of the world for un
told generations." The reason for Euro
pean neglect lies in the "corrupt and
ephemeral nature of South American gov
ernments and the existence of the Monroe

the United States. .That power neither

America's Strong- Position.
"The occupation of Cuba has placed
the United States In a position of strength
which no maritime power with interests
in South America can afford to ignore.
Cuba In the old days formed the pivot oC
Spanish rule on the continent, and from
thence America will work. Is there any
thing remarkable that the Kaiser should
be steadily preparing for a conflict he
may -well deem inevitable? He cannot be
ignorant of the vigorous requisition for
coaling stations in all parts of the world
now being carried on by the United
States from the Azores to Yokohama.
German interests in South America are
already considerable, and it must be re
membered that her population is growing
enormously in excess of the capacities of
the Fatherland to maintain it. No ab
sorption of German-speaking Austria or
the opening up of Asia Minor for tradn

and South America remains both the rich

HAS WARNING
FOR PRESIDENT
NEW YORK, May 5.â Not against
England, but against the United
States, according to the London
Saturday. Review, is the enor
mous expansion of the German
navy now in progress directed. William
II, a "man who has shown himself sin
gularly gifted in grasping vital problems
before . his , country," is preparing for the
future, in which he foresees the possibil
ity of a great naval struggle with the
United States for partition or exploitation
of the great Sojith American continent.
How this argument, which has been re
sumed succinctly in recent cable dis
patches, is developed is of no little inter
est in view of the SDecial Interviews from
Berlin and Washington on the American-
German relations published last week.
Professing to give the real reasons for
the Kaiser's desire to create a great navy,
the Saturday Review says:
Development of German Energy. .
"He has seen that the richest and most
accessible field for the development of
German energy and emigration lies in.
South America. But over that vast and
little explored continent hangs the
shadow of the Monroe doctrine, and In
that must Ho the supreme menace to Ger
man-expansion. Like a wise ruler he pre
pares for the future. As the Saturday
Revlew has for so long been pointing out.
the mo3t severely practical reasoning
leads us to anticipate that the readiest
causes for future naval conflicts will be
found in the struggle for partition or ex
ploitation of the great South American
continent.

ing the festivities the fun did not lag for
a moment.
There were footraces, swimming con
tests, kangaroo! partnership, three-legged
and a dozen other different kinds of races,
that were participated in by the halt, the
blind, fat men, skinny men and others.
Judge Fritz captured the fat man's
race, and Herman Haydenfeldt, who
came in a close second, raised a
howl because the jurist lacked a
superfluity of flesh. He subsided when
threatened with a fine for contempt
of 'court. Al Coney and "Billy" O'Kane,
two athletes of the "old world," ran a
special fat man's race. Coney dashed
down the stretch with the speed of a man
running backward and crossed the wire
twenty lengths ahead of O'Kane, who was
rating behind. There were other races,
but their only features were the falls and
ripped trousers of the contestants.
Luncheon was served In the winery.

NEW TEAM WINS THE
DAVIS TENNIS CUPS
Dr. I/ane and Orville Pratt Will Have
Their Names Inscribed Upon
the Prize.
The twelfth handicap doubles tourna
ment for the Davis cups was won by a new
team yesterday â Dr. â¢ Lane and â¢ Orville
Pratt. The final match between the win
ners and Ray Cornell and Grant Smith
was the most stubborn contest of the day.
Only four teams participated/but the
tennis produced was the best seen at the
local courts for some time.- The first, and
what was thought to be the match of the
day, was between William" Collier and
Harold Crowell and Ray Cornell and
Grant Smith. Each team had won the
cups twice and the latter had beaten the
former in the last two tournaments, con
sequently the match attracted a. great
deal of attention. Collier and Crowell al
lowed their opponents odds of naif fifteen
and were beaten easily, the score being
6 â 2, 6 â i in favor of Smith and Cornell.
The latter would have won. had. the match
been, on even terms.
The next match was between R. N.
.Whitney and Chet Smith on one side, and
Dr. Lane and Pratt on the other. The for
mer-allowed their opponents odds of one
half thirty, which proved to be a very
fair handicap, as the- score shows. When
Whitney and Smith won the second set
6â1 it looked as if they would take the
last set easily, but after a desperate strug
gle Lane and Pratt won out, 9â 7. The
complete score in their* favor was 7â5,
1â6,- Dâ 7.
In the final match Lane and Pratt re
ceived odds of- half thirty from Cornell
and Smith and In this case also the han
dicap was - correct. â¢ Lane and Pratt won
the first set -6 â 4 and in . the second set
Â¦were ahead most of the time, but the
scratch men played a fine up-hill game
and finally took the set 11â9. ,
In the lasts set Cornell and Smith took
the first two srames easily .and looked to
be sure winners, but their opponents took
a brace arid won the next/ five; games
straight. . ' â¢'* _ '
1 Xhe final score In favor of Dr. Lane and
Pratt was 6-^4, SHll, 6â4. , .
thirst that was only satiated by copious
libations. Chicken and pie disappeared
with even greater rapidity than the wine.
Five long tables were necessary to seat
the members and their guests. Flowers
and greens added a charm to their ap
pearance, and the crowd that sat at the
banquet board was as happy a "bunch"
of athletes as ever graced a table. After
luncheon the members quieted down for a
short period and listened to throat exer
cises by Ossie Franks, Signor Abramoff,
"Kid" Nelson and Frank /Thompson, Ed
Sager, Eddie Angelo and Walter Howe,
composing the Aenid Quartet. They were
all compelled -to â¢ respond to hearty en
cores. Thompson told some funny ones,
"Bobby" Mitchell narrated some bird
stories and Jimmy Welch gave some Ital
ian impersonations. Maurice Kramer was
master at the keys, and a string band
"discoursed" its share of harmony, and
not a kick was launched.
Credit is due George James, the club s
captain, for the success of the outing. It
was at his suggestion that it was held.
Messrs. Coffroth, Cunningham and Mitch
ell were indefatigable in their efforts and
deserve commendation.
The races resulted as follows:

CARRIER'S JESSIE E
WINS CHALLENGE RACE
Eeats the New Yacht Alert by Nearly
Six Minutes Over Twelve
Â¦ . Mile Course.
The California Yacht Club's challenge
race yesterday was won by J. T. Carrier's
sloop Jessie E by five minutes forty-five
seconds. The course was from the south
erly pier head of the narrow gauge mole
to and around Presidio shoal buoy and
back to the starting point. There were
five contestants, the new sloop Alert,
owned by T. Kendall, Robert Vincent and
F. V. Green; the â¢sloop Pactolus. owned
by ex-Commodore A. M. Clay; the sloop
Jessie E, owned by J. T. Carrier; the yawl
Gypsie, owned by Vice Commodore C. E.
Clark, and George Miller's sloop Occident.
Commodore S. S. Marshall's sloop Thelma
was prevented fronventering the race ow
ing to the damage suffered from a colli
sion with the steamer Transit on Satur
day night.
A preparatory gun was fired at 1 p. m.
and the starting gun ten minutes later,
the start being a one-gun start. George
Miller's sloop Occident crossed the line
first, followed closely by' the sloop Jessie
E, the yawl Gypsie and the sloops Alert
and Pactolus. For a time the boats kept
close together, until the Pactolus stood
over toward the city front to get the ben
efit of the beginning of the ebb tide. The
breeze was moderate at the outset, -but
freshened, considerably in the. channel,
where the Jessie E went to the front,
rounding the buoy three minutes and thir
ty seconds ahead of the sloop Alert. The
other yachts, being top far astern to beat
the two leaders, did not round the mark.
On the run home the greater stze of the
Alert enabled her to overhaul and pass
her rival, Jessie E, and she crossed the
finishing line at 3:27:46.- The Jessie E
crossed nearly three . minutes ' later, at
3:30:37. The elapsed time of the Alert was
2 hours 17 minutes and 46 seconds, and, as
she was the largest boat in the race, her
corrected time was the same. The elapsed
time of the Jessie E was 2 hours 20 min
utes 37 seconds, but her time allowance of
8 minutes 36 seconds made her corrected
time 2 hours 12 minutes and 1 second, thus
bringing her in a winner by a margin 'of
5 minutes and 45 seconds. The early part
of the race ' was on a flood tide and the
latter part on. an ebb. . -..
The committee in charge of the race
consisted of A. R. F. Brandes, N. L.
Meads and R. R. THommedieu in the
place of Eugene Flanders.

Hawaiian tracks, according to the Hono
lulu Advertiser of April 25.
In a race at Honolulu between Virgle A
and Aggravation some few weeks ago
the former, with Nichols up, won without
any work. It was the general opinfon
that Oplopio. who had the mount on Ag
gravation, had sold out to Nlehqls.
A second race was arranged and it was
in connection with this that Nichols
played his game. "Soldier" O'Donnell.
the Camp McKinley plunger, who played
Vlrgie A heavily, was persuaded by
Nichols that the horse won on Its merits,
so he backed the horse again and heavily
at that. The second time Virgie A was
beaten and in such a manner as to leave
no doubt as to the kind of a ride Nicholas
gave her. Nichols was after O'Donnell's
money. He jrot it. Nichols left Hono

ALEC PAPE and Frank O'Karie, g
members -of the Olympic Club,,
committed a breach of amateur
etiquette at the annual outing of
the Olympic â¢ Club yesterday at"
Escalles. They brought down a. storm of
disapproval â¢ on their . devoted 'heads by s
bunkoing their opponents in the egg and
spoon race. This exciting event was run
in two heats owing to the number of
starters. Pape has been using the spoons
on the water nnd. was. familiar with the
game. O'Kane, on the other hand, was
familiar with the table article through
usage, and, combined with his knowledge
of foot racing, was in a fair way to win
the race. Pape stuck his egg to the spoon
with a hunk of chewing gum and won*his
heat. O'Kane was so hungry that he swal
lowed his egg before the finish. The Ama
teur Athletic Association may hold a spe
cial investigation and disbar both ath
letes. ...
It was an ideal day for an, outing, and"
more than 400 members of the club en- ,
joyed it. The committee, which was com

Bohemians Wreck Oakland's
' Chances at Recreation
Grounds.
Sacramento 4, Oakland 1.
Prosperity wrought the undoing of the
unhappy Dudes yesterday morning and
afternoon. Some miles removed from the
whirl of things-pon the Oakland groundsâ
the Senators read Cal Ewing a lesson for
showing the brazen spirit. This happened
during church hours. Then the Oakland
and the Sacramento teams came back to
the place where the wind blows and the
fegs prevail. Defeat number two in a
single day was registered against Ewing
oii the Recreation Grounds, and that
meant the odd game of the series for the
Statesmen.
Ewing, who is as prolific of excuses as
was Solomon of proverbs, charges the af
ternoon defeat to the presence of the Bohe
mian Club men in their own private, spe
cial and unlabeled box. A small but fanat
ical coterie filled the six allotted chairs.
Five of them thought they knew the
baseball of the present. The sixth admit
ted his ignorance by recalling the old days
when Bob Woodward was the star pitcher
of the Pacific Union Club, and recited
"o'er again" that historic game in which
the Pacifies scored 83 runs to 12 for the
Bohemians. After that the air was filled
with offers of bottle bets, but without a
taking. Ewing holds it as inviolable law
that when any one offers a bet on his
team and the second party sinks into in
significance it is a sure thing that he will
lose.
And he lost. Nine full innings they
played, and in all that time and after all
that diamond scraping work the sweet
scented Dudes hit Stricklett for just two
blushing hits. One of them came in the
third inning from Francks' stick, which,
combined with an error, sent that isolated
swatter over the rubber. Then Oakland
rested, quietly, gently and stoically, until
the nine of them were told that the game
was over and that they could go home.
In the seventn inning the Senators cast
off the toga and assumed the dress of
war. They formed a catapultic company
and bombarded Moskiman for four hits,
which resulted in three runs. Even the
old-world Bohemian realized at this point
of the game that the day was done, so he
â¢went home to think of the bottles he
might have lost. The score:

MORNING GAME.
Sacramento 9, Oakland 5.
.Held of the Dudes' brigade was tried on
the Oakland grounds yesterday morning.
He . occupied the slab and was soon re
tired as a dead one, or at the best one liv
ing In extremis. After giving free trans
portation to two Senators he balked like
an unruly horse. Then the base advance
game went on, and Held went out, to be
replaced by Babbitt.
Eight innings tvere played and then the
game was called on account of time. In
the seventh Sacramento fell upon Babbitt
for many and diverse hits of all kinds of
caliber. In the eighth inning Oakland re
covered consciousness, and with a couple
of hits and attendant Senatorial errors
scored three. The feature of the game
â¢was Devereaux' b home run hit over the
left field fence. The score:

Earned runs â San Francisco 3. Two-base
Last Sunday, \ despite the disagreeable
weather, there was a large attendance of
trap-shooters at Ingleside and the great
est enthusiasm was displayed: but yes
terday, "with conditions ideal for the sport,
comparatively few shooters put in an ap
pearance. In compensation for the de
ficiency'in attendance some very. clever
shooting , was done both at the live birds
and at the inanimate targets.
The occasion was the third shoot of the
season for the California Wing Gun Club
and the Union Gun Club held forth at
the bluerock traps. At the live-bird shoot
O. Feudner, J. V. . Coleman, Halght and
Fay secured clean scores, while A. M.
Shields, Stelling and Williamson each al
lowed a single bird to wing its flight be
yond the bounds.
O. Feudner also distinguished himself
at the bluerock traps by smashing twen
ty-five without a miss. In the ability han
dicap, in which the members of the Union
Gun Club were handicapped according to
their relative ability, Justins, Walpert,
Stultz and Kerrison tied for first. During
the above shoot Stultz accomplished
twenty-three straight kills.

Gun Club made at the live-bird traps were

OLYMPIC CLUB MEN MAKE MERRY
UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE
Palo Alto, Eugeno Geary's champion
greyhound, demonstrated to a large crowd
of enthusiasts yesterday that he was a
courser of unexcelled merit, and to those
who have watched his wonderful career
the fast dog showed that even among tho
best of them he Is in a class by himself.
The deciding course of the big 128-dog
stake at Union Park found Palo Alto and
Sisquoc left to contend for final honors.
These top-notchers met In the last course
of the champion event of two weeks ago
and, as in the last stake, both had an
even amount of work. Sisquoc was beat
en pointless after having displayed great
qualities in the previous rounds.
In yesterday's event the Petaluma
hound refused Luxq> at' point in his first
course. Little Sister was his next victim,
Ireland and Fiery Face following, both
being beaten pointless. In the semi-final
Sisquoc in a close course got the flag from
Harlean Gladys.
A good play was on the final with Palo
Alto a 2 to 1 favorite. Jim Grace had
done great work throughout the stake
and the slip for the final was a perfect
one.
Lake a double team on the speed track
the dogs shot up the field, not an inch dif
ference between them, until nearing tha
turn Geary's dog went out for the lead.
When the flag went up the black and
white champion had added another stake
to his long list.
Harlean Gladys was a factor in the go
ing and came near to being a contestor
in the final. Not a point was scored
against her until the runner up beat her
out a point. Master Rocket got as far aa
the semi-final by clever work. Twice he
landed on the short end, against Wedge
wood at 6 tol, the surprise of the day, and
at 5 to 2 against Rural Artist. Sir Pasha,
too, seemed imbued with his old-time
stake-winning spirit and reached a good
position. Fiery Faco and Greenhall also
performed well.
The sapling stakes resulted in a double
victory for P. Horgan's Wild Tralee-Just
Eclipsed litter.
In the second Tame Tralee beat Miss
Pye, a 2 to 5 favorite. The victory was
a pleasant one to Tim Cronin, owner of
Wild Tralee, the sire of the winning
youngsters.' ' The saplings promise to
show up well in the future, if they are
allowed a long rest.
Other short ends: Tyrone Prince beat
Mose, Fiery Face beat Hot Haste at 3 to
1, Liberator beat Roman Athlete at 5 to 1,
Jingle Bells beat Roman Athlete at 5 to 2,
Harlean Gladys beat Sir Pasha at 5 to 3.

Kinyoun will surrender himself here to
morrow. , .
SAN RAFAEL, May 6.â Federal Quar
antine Officer Dr. J. J. Kinyoun has not
yet been arrested. The warrant issued
yesterday by Judge Rodden of this city
upon complaint of Joseph, de "Wolfe of
Tiburon.'who swore that the doctor tr.'ed
to fill him full of rifle balls, Is reposing In
the pocket of Constable George A'gnew.
Kinyoun is charced with assault to mur

Unable to find Kinyoun In the city last
night Agnew returned there to-day and
learned that Kinyoun was at Angel
Island. Upon ascertaining this the Con
stable went to Tiburon, procured a launch
and headed for the island. Upon landing
he telephoned to Kinyoun, expecting that
the doctor would gladly surrender. The
doctor, according to Agnew's story, re
fused to be arrested unless assured that
he would not be detained at San Rafael.
This condition could not be agreed to by
the Constable, who. demanded an uncon
ditional surrender. Further parlev over
the wire resulted in Agnew being informed
that he was a trespasser on the Island
and that only a United States Marshal
could /irrest the doctor.
The harrowing tale of how the Krag
bullets are said to have whistled about
the head of boatman De Wolfe was still
sounding in Agnew's ears and the Con
stable retreated to his launch and head
ed back, to Tiburon under a full head of
steam. - ' â¢

In the beginning, but when he opened
Hutchinson's strong box in the safe de
posit vaults he found bags of gold and
bundles of valuable securities. This big
fortune will go to Herbert Hutchinson of
Philadelphia, a brother of the old Circle

/. the Arctic Trail.
SEATTLE, May 5.â The Nome Gold Dig
ger of February 6 says that every one
will learn with surprise that an effort is
being made in the postofHce to prevent
letters being carried to the outside by
men going over the trail. The isolation
of this country during the long months of
"white silence"- and the dreary time that
elapses, even by the quickest mode of
travel, before friends can be communi
cated with has hitherto made people glad
ly grasp at any chance that : offers of
shortening by a few weeks the passage of
letters to the outside. No one has thought
of wondering whether the local postofllce
would-lose a few cents In the way of can
cellations. â¢
It seems, however, that these few cents
are now grudged. High legal authorities
who have been consulted, but prefer not
to be quoted for publication, state em
phatically that under the existing circum
stances . the postoffice officials have no
right whatever to prevent travelers from
carrying letters for private individuals.
Postmaster Wright has issued a ukase
that no man going out over the trail may
carry letters, and he adds that any one
bold enough to defy this Imperative de
cree will be arrested at Eaton, have his
mail confiscated and be fined, even if he
is lucky enough to escape languishing in
a dungeon cell. Â¦

elopers from that place, who were arrest
ed Saturday night by Detective Whitta
ker. The warrants were sworn to by the
woman's husband. She says she will be
glad to get back, as she is anxious to see
tier four children again. She claims that
her husband treated her cruelly and beat
her children so hard that blood flowed
from their wounds. She seems to be in
fatuated with Pratt.
A number of instances are cited show-
Ing how agents have abused their power
for their own pecuniary benefit and with
demoralizing consequences to the Indians.
The report says it seems evident that
whatever temporary improvement may be
made by changes in the personnel of the
Indian service, no lasting reform can be
Inaugurated without a change in the sys
tem itself.
It is submitted that under section 1753
of the Revised Statutes the Chief Execu
tive has the right to promulgate regula
tions declaring that all appointments of
Indian agents hereafter shall be made by
promotion from the superintendents of
Indian schools and from the other higher
grades in the classified Indian service and
by details from the army. In pursuance
of this statute, an inspector might be se
lected by the President from the classified
service to ascertain and report the rela
tive qualifications of the different persons
in this service eligible for appointment.
S "Recently the Secretary of the Interior
required that the bids for the leasing of
Indian lands should be opened and the
leases awarded in Washington under the
direct supervision of the Indian Bureau,
and not. as formerly, upon the reserva
tions. Â¦; The result, of this system and of
the' exposure of the fraudulent use of
Indian lands already shows a net gain to
the Indians of about $150,000, the greater
part of which was upon the Osage Res
ervation alone. " Nothing could better il
lustrate the enormous waste and pre
sumptive peculations which have existed
in the past in respect to this one feature
of Indian administration."

tions In the Indian service, with particu
lar reference to the appointment of agents
under . the present administration, has
been presented to the council of the

contained -In the report have also been,
submitted to President McKinley. The
report says in part:
"Under the system of patronage ap
pointments to these wards- of the nation
nave in many cases been despoiled â¢ by
fraudulent contracts whereby the agents
have obtained large sums of money in
violation of law, while the morals of the
Indians have been corrupted by the ex

An ugly^scandai has arisen over tha
suicide of Fred Hathaway which seriously
involves the Coroner's office, and charges
of robbing tho body of the dead man are
made by his relatives, and it is not unlike
ly that the matter may be called to the
attention of the Grand Jury.
Disappointed In love, young Hathaway
committed suicide by inhaling illuminat
ing gas In a lodging-house at 737 Market
street. The day preceding his act of self
destruction he had purchased a pair of
shoes and a hat, which were found in the
room when the body was discovered. Out
of respect to the wishes of the relatives
of the dead man Coroner Leland did not
have the body removed to the Morgue,
but allowed it to be taken to the home of
his relatives. Following the usual custom
in such cases, the Coroner's deputies took
charge of the clothing and effects of tha
suicide and had them conveyed to tha
Morgue. After the Inquest the. effects of
the dead man were sent to his relatives. !
On opening the package which contained
the clothing of young Hathaway his

SCANDAL HANGS
OVER MORGUE
So strong is the feeling created thet If
the friends of the officers and men on
board the transport could have their way
the local Board of Health of Honolulu
would be abolished and a Federal quaran
tine would take its place. The Kilpatrick,
which was bound from San Francisco
with 840 regulars and 40 women and chil
dren aboard, reported at Honolulu that
she had two mild cases of smallpox
aboard. She- was ordered to lie outside of
the reef at the local quarantine, which Is
a hot berth. In order to give the men a
chance to breathe fresh air and get a lit
tle exercise General Sanger, inspector
general, who' was senior officer aboard,
asked permission for the troops to dis
embark and ko Into camp at an isolated
point several miles from the city. He
agreed to thoroughly fumigate the clothes
of the men and to keep them under strict
guard, so as to prevent stragglers while
on the Journey, and to station a double
cordon around the camp so as to prevent
any of the men from stealing into the
city. The Honolulu Board of Health was,
however, inexorable, and the ship's pas
sengers were compelled to remain aboard
and swelter while the transport was tak
ing on coal and supplies. The action of
the Board of Health is indorsed by the
city, which within the past few- years has
passed through an epidemic of the bu
bonic plague and cholera, and older resi
dents recalled the dreadful mortality suf
fered when the smallpox prevailed. In
view of the precautions which the army
detachment agreed to take and the fur
ther fact that the two cases of smallpox
were mild, the refusal of the Board of
Health to grant permission to land is
deeply regretted in army circles and has
been the subject of bitter comment.

At home I understand that I was thought
bloodthirsty, but in China I was the most
Jrnient of the Ministers except one. We knew
the conditions better than those who were not
there could possibly know them. Drastic
measures were demanded, but I do not think
we were cruel. What would Fpern & severe
punishment to us at home would not impress
thÂ» Chinese at all, for the reason that they
indulge in to many cruel and unusual punish
ments. The reports of cruelty on, the part of
the soldiers have been crossly exaggerated,
though I arn sure that there was plenty of
brutality on the part of the individual 6ol
<liprs. A* an army the allies were exceed
ingly wU behaved. Kor were the Btorles of
unrestricted looting true. In Peking the sol
dir-rs took what they ne<?<!ed, of course, just as
wo T-ouid have 6eized anything that we need
pi while we wprÂ» cagc*d uo in the compound
had we b*<Â»n able to fasten upon anything
that would help us to withstand the Elege. As
for the stories of missionary lootlnjr, they are
unfliserulsedly false. The missionaries did not
loot.
As far as the punishment of Chinese offl
c:a!s gws China has already done all that she
could. Something out of the ordinary had
to be demanded by the powers, for it takes
a good deal of punishment to impress this
pÂ«"op!e, and this was no ordinary offense. In
some eases the official whose punishment was
demanded was more powerful than the Gov
ernment, ar.d then, of course, the punish
ment could not be enforced. Except In these
case? everything was done as the powers de
manded.
Russia has so far mitigated her demands
that there is now not much danger of serious
difficulty between her and Japan. Personally
I am very much in iavor of the continued ex
istence of China as an empire, coverned by
her own Emperor. It will save us and all
the re?t of the world lots of trouble if the
Integrity of the empire Is maintained. - -Â¦

Elnce I left China six weeks ago, the powers

men to agree on anything, especially when
they have eleven governments with differing
views behind them. China is perfectly willing
to do anything: that the powers agree upon â
that is, anything within her ability to accom
plish. She is only too anxious to expedite
these matters and settle down to peaceable
pursuits again. Of course the powers must
not dimand an indemnity which China will be
physically unable to raise. It Is not certain
that, finally, some nation may not demand
territory of China in lieu of a money indem
nity. It is perfectly certain that if any na
tion does make this demand the partition of
China will follow and this will inevitably
r.ausÂ« much dissension between the powers.
These difficulties and disputes would be long

WALL STREET STILL THE CENTER
-|â â¢* OR a fortnight Wall street has engrossed the
rH attention of the country. General trade, which
-*- is to Wall street as a house of cards, built up by
an infaift to be blown down again the moment it is
finished, has been in a measure lost sight of. All
eyes have been centered upon the great railroad deals
and the financial cyclones they are causing in the
national maelstrom. A Mr. Phillips, at Chicago, is
playing a very prominent second violin there, and
has the Board of Trade alive with jumping jacks,
dancing to his music and clutching with greedy fin
gers at his stream of golden' corn, which he lets flow
or dams up at will.- The country has gone mad over
speculation, and the higher the quotations the higher
people think they will go, and it is useless to try to
convince them to the contrary. The New York bank
ers have for weeks been warning operators and the
public not to venture too far, but their words of cau
tion, according to the press dispatches, "have been
met. with ridicule."
The scenes in Wall street during the week were
wild enough to suit the most blase operator. .The
public joined in the fight of the vast interests for the
control of certain railroad stocks, and bought every
thing right and left, stretching their credit and bor
rowing all the money they could get to keep up their
niargins. When, on Friday, the break came, it threw
them into wild disorder and they scrambled for cover.
More scrambling of this sort will be done later on."
Â¦ The general trade of the country, considered apart
from this dementia in Wall street, seems to be going
along all right The bank clearings continue to make
a brilliant surface showing, as pointed. out a week
ago, the gain last week over the same week in 1900
being 64.5 per cent, the lion's share of this increase
being due to the speculation in Wall street But even
with that eliminated there would still be a substantial
increase. The failures' were 163 against 173 for the
same week last year.
The staples are in the main featureless and uninter
esting at the moment. Wheat remains about the
same, the daily fluctuations varying but little from the
point at which the" market has stood so long. , Pro
visions, too, seem to hover about a point more or less
fixed. The textiles are dull, with a further decline
in print. cloths, while wool, which has lately shown
more life in the West and on the Pacific Coast, re
mains dull in the East Concessions are being made
by sellers of boots and shoes, but Western jobbers
are ordering more freely and shipments from Eastern
points are reported larger than a year ago. The iron
and steel tra^e continues to make a good., showing,
but it is now said that the production is creeping up
to the consumption, as it did *a year or more ago.
Better weather has caused an improvement in jobbing
and retail business throughout the country, and the
crop prospects are very- good almost everywhere.
In California the situation has undergone a marked
ci:ange during the week. The heavy rains of a week
ago have practically settled the crop question, and
large yields of cereals are now almost assured. Lighter
fruit crops this year will probably mean higher prices,
acd already quotations for dried fruits have advanced
slightly, as before mentioned. Grapes "and wine
promise good returns, and there is now a very good
demand for spring wool, and a stiff market for hops.
It looks as if the farmer was to have another inning.
This creates confidence among the banks and mer
chants, helps credits and stimulates new enterprises,
and whatever may be going qn over 'the Rockies it
is undeniable that the outlook for a fine year in Cali
fornia is brilliant.
The Bosto/i papers in commenting upon McKin
ley's tour say he will not attain the full height of the
pleasure he expects until he reaches that city; so it
appears the people over there have but a faint idea of
the joys of California. -j
A CHANGED WORLD.
k STRIKING illustration of the politicarchanges;:
/\ that have taken place in the world in, the last*
â¢f *- twenty years is afforded by the publication by
the.British Museum of a recently obtained manuscript
containing a memorandum . on the eastern question,
drawn up by Chinese Gordon in 1880. Gordon rec
ommended the adoption of the following programme:
(1.) The complete purchase of Cyprus.
(2.) The abandonment of the Asia Minor reforms.
(3.) The union of Bulgaria and Rumelia, with a port."
(4.) The increase of Greece.
(5.) Constantinople a state, undSr European guarantees
(6.) Increase of Montenegro and Italy on that coastl'
(7.) Annexation of Egypt by England, either directly
or by having paramount and entire authority. ;.
(8.) Annexation of Syria by Franceâ dittoâ ditto
ditto.. (By this means France would.be as interested in
stopping Russian progress as England Is.)
(9.) Italy to be allowed to extend toward "Abyssinia. ;
(10.) Re-establishment of ~the Turkish constitution,
and the establishment of a similar one in Egypt {(these
constitutions,, if not . interfered ; with,: would, soon rid
Turkey and E&j'Pt of their parasite Pashas). '
An attempt to apply that programme to existing
conditions will show how far the -world has swung
avvzy from the conditions of 1880. The purchase of
Cyprus has been completed. The proposed- increase
of Greece has been tried by Greece.herselfand the
result has been disastrous to her. Great Britain-, has
The citizens of Vallejo deserve credit for their ac
tivity in urging upon the executive committee the
change in the programme. Their action promises to
be beneficial not to themselves only but to the State,
and it is to be hoped that when the trip is made they
will have the satisfaction of receiving not only the
Secretary of the Navy*and the visiting Congressmen
but the .President and all the members of his Cabinet
who have attended. him on. the tour.
Even should the President be unable to visit the
navy yard it will be something to have the establish
ment inspected by the Secretary of the Navy and the
Congressmen who are to be with us at the time. The
main object of placing Vallejo on the programme is
to give the officials an opportunity to make a personal
inspection of the Government station at Mare Island
so that they may perceive its importance and' note
what is needed in tKe way of extension and improve
ment to fit it for the demands which our increasing
interests-in the Pacific Ocean will put upon it.
Out of the complex duties imposed upon him dur
ing the time of his stay here, it is possible, of course,
lhat the President will be unable to make the visit to
Vallejo, but none the less he should have opportunity,
and it is to be hoped he will be able to profit by it.
The trip itself will not be fatiguing. In fact it would
be something of a rest from the parades and public
functions which will mainly occupy him during his
stay in the city.
It was announced at the conference that the aim of
the executive committee is to show the President just
what he wishes to see, and not to impose too much
upon him. With that aim the public will sympathize.
.It is now well understood the President's tour is one
of almost incessant sightseeing, receptions and speech
n aking. Such work is fatiguing under any circum
stances, and is particularly so when accompanied by
vapid travel. The President has with him his Cabinet,
and a great deal of public business will have to be
attended to by them during the trip; and in addition
thereto care will have to be taken that the programme
does not entail too, much exertion for the ladies who
accompany, the party.
FROM every point of view it is gratifying that
a visit to the Mare Island navy yard has been
included in the programme of entertainment pro
vided in this city for President McKinley and his
Cabinet. It is true that arrangements made on Satur
day between the Vallejo committee and the executive
reception committee do not definitely commit the
President to a visit to Mare Island, but it was con
ceded^ the Secretary" of the Navy and visiting Con
gressmen would inspect the navy yard, and the Presi
dent will, of course, have the option of joining them
should he find time to do so. â
THE VALLEJO PROGRAMME.
The French battleship Jena is passing
through an -extended and varied series
of engine trials, two of which have been
very . satisfactory.. The first, under -one
third power, gave 5S81 horsepower, with
a coal consumption of 1.3S pounds and a
speed of 13.S knots, and the second, un
der four-fifths power, , gave easily 12.500
horsepower, with a 'consumption of 1.51
pounds. The Jena is of 12,052. tons, and
calculated to make a speed of 13 knots
with 15,000 horsepower. The vessel has

determined to ' send out the old storeship
Supply, which .Is said to have lain in or
dinary at the New Tork yard for many
years. The record of this old craft is
rather interesting as a link between the
old and the new navy. The Supply was a
sailing ship of &Â« tons, - purchased in
1846. for $60,000. During the second year
of the. Civil War she captured a schooner/
laden with arms for the Confederacy, and

Coloocoresses, commanding officer of the
Supply, a snug. fortune. -The ship served
afterward as storeship on the European
station, and was laid up from 1S70 to 1778,
when she made a cruise to 'â¢France, and
was finally retired . April 3, 1379. In 13S2
'Congress authorized the" sale of forty
six useless u vessels," and the Supply was
sold at auction May 3, 1884,^ to Gregory.

Navy Journal is correct it would appear
that the buyer repented of his purchase
and that our navy must be hard pressed
for available material when pushed to
resurrect a vessel that was worth only
$1300 seventeen years ago for service la
the far-off Pacific. The * probabilities are,
however, that another vesser of the samo
name, formerly the Illinois, purchased
from the, International Navigation Com

provisions to Cuba during the late war

WORLD'S NAVAL NEWS.
As the new British loan of $300,000,000 is said to
have been subscribed four times over as soon as it
was announced, it is evident the question of cost is
not going to interfere with the war in South Africa.
Old Dame 'Britannia has money to burn.
Thus with the kindergarten carried ' up into the
schools and the universities aspiring to assist young
men to hold down Government jobs, we progress.
Public education has indeed become a well nigh uni
versal profession and eventually it may undertake to
fit aspiring youth for the vaudeville stage. -
The exercises are .described as "language lessons"
and we are told the children are distinctly warned
against karning to read the words, as the object is to
teach, them to speak and "to think. From simple
wcrds the children are carried to sentences, and are
railed upon to see and hear and act out such phrases
as "'wash your face," "comb your hair," "brush your
clothes/' etc. After four months of that training it
is claimed the child will have mastered the foundations
of education-; by having learned to "see," to think and
to speak, instead of learning merely to read.
A'stranger novelty'than'that'of a university course
to fit young men for Government clerkships is a com
mon school method of teaching language to children
which has been devised in Chicago. The method is
described by its promoters as ."a of
visualization, auralization- and. action"â or, in the
words of common speech, of seeing, hearing and do
ing. 1 It is in the doing especially that the system is
entertaining. Thus the child is shown such words as
"hop,V "skip," or ."jump"; then the words are pro
nounced distinctly, and then the teacher hops, skips,
and jumps and each pupil is required to follow her
example, calling out the word as he does each act.
That is a very high sounding promise, and doubt
less it means as well as it sounds, but nevertheless a
young man of average ability and ambition will hardly
choose well if he determines to spend his university
years in fitting himself for a Government clerkship.
Even if every subordinate position in every depart
ment of the Government were included in the so
cnl'.ed merit system, and were attainable by passing
examinations, , there would be very little in the way
of inducement for far-seeing young men to enter the
service. The Government gives good pay for ordin
ary work, and most Government clerks do that ordin
ary work in. a very ordinary way, so they are well
paid for what they, do;. but the chances of promotion
are slight and few men obtain in governmental posi
tions anything like the. rewards they might have ob
tained had they worked in the open world of com
merce and industry. The youth who enters the ser
vice so buoyantly- is .generally a . disappointed man

WISCONSIN University,, which has now
upwards of 2500 students, has established a
course of preparation for public service, giv
ing instruction in such subjects as are supposed to fit
men for entering 'upon public life as a profession. A
prospectus of the nÂ« vv, departure I says : "While the
course constitutes a thorough training for citizenship,
its specific purpose is the preparation for active work
in the administrative departments. The Federal Gov
ernment has over 80,000 positions i under the merit
system. While the most- of these positions do not
demand qualifications of a high order, there is a con
siderable and increasing number which do require
such qualifications. The State and municipal gov
ernments of our nation are also constantly in need
of public servants who have acquired a special train
ing. And although the merit system has not, as yet,
been extended to many, classes of positions, neverthe
less the persons who are in possession of special quali
fication are in ever-increasing demand. Such a move
ment on the part of the Government must be assisted
by offering in the great institutions of learning oppor
tunity for acquiring a thorough knowledge . of the
business of government. â¢.' To the training in the gen
eral principles of politics and methods of government
there will be added in this course specific instruction
in the work of the various governmental departments,
and the students' will also be kept informed concern
ing the various openings for a career in the public
service; as well as the requirements and examinations
that form a conditiqn for entering thereupon."

House, but the. man we honor and nine who share

But he finds the frontiers gone s The rapid march
of population and improvement has effaced the log
house; the game no longer promises the hunter a sole
means of subsistence; the plains it ranged' over arc
now modern farms or pasture for thousands of neat
cattle; the crane is hung in the fireplace no more.
Men seem to need more law to restrain them and life
has lost its noble simplicity. There is more comfort
in the land, but it is hard to convince an old frontiers
man that there is more happiness.
The pioneer goes back fondly to the scenes of his
early life or his frontier experiences. President Mc-
Kinley in this great tour has crossed many a frontier
whose line is marked now only in the sturdy character
of the people, and wherever he meets them there is a
quick touch of recognition and sympathy and the
greeting of qualities which they have in common. -
The life of the pioneer was an educating experience.
In the absence of statutes, which now 'regulate human
action too much, the pioneers practiced self-restraint,
abstinence' and mutual justice. They learned and in
stinctively practiced the rule that a man's best pro
tection in his own rights is by respecting the same
rights in his neighbor. When examined it is seen
that such' principle and practice are, the germ of all
Statesmanship and of all diplomacy. So the people
have made no mistake in choosing nearly half of their
Presidents from the frontier. When their careers are
examined it will be seen that each furnishes evidence
of the pioneer quality of mind, and sense of justice,
and instinctive statesmanship. â¢/ â¢ /
TEN Presidents of the United States have gone
forward to that great office out of pioneer condi
tions, on the Western and Southwestern frontier.
Jackson, the two Harrisons, Polk, Lincoln, Johnson,
Grant, Hayes/ Garfield and McKinLey, all were reared
or lived amongst the frontier scenes and tasted of that
rugged and excellent frontier life which equipped men
for independence and prepared them for any burden
of responsibility and the fearless facing of any fate
involving duty in war or in peace. .The pioneer gen
erations are passing away. President McKinley will
probably be the last chief magistrate of the republic
whose life goes back to the log house period in those
States that now cluster around the country's .'center
of population. What to him is personal experience
will be to his successors history and tradition:

The people of Vallejo appreciate the efforts of
The San Francisco Call, both in its editorial
and local columns, to have President McKlnley
visit Mare Island. The editor of The Call takes
a broad and commendable view of the situation
and Vallejo will not forget him.
A FRIEND OF VALLEJO.
A Friend of Vallejo.
The Vallejo Times of Saturday morning
has the following editorial:
From the article In another column it will be
eeen that The San Francisco Call and Senator
Luchslnger are entitled to the warmest thanks
ot the people of this community. "Whether the
President comes to Mare Island or not, those
who seek to bring him here should be thanked
for the interest shown in the community.
The- News also quotes the editorial and
the news article from The Call.
Entitled to "Wannest Thanks.
The Vallejo Morning News has the fol
lowinff editorial: -."-
The Vallejo Chronicle publishes the .edi
torial and article from The Call under the
following heading: MAY YET VISIT
MARE ISLAND. THE CALL. ACTS
PROMPTLY ON SENATOR LUCHSING
ER'S LETTER. SAYS THAT MOST IM
PORTANT TRIP OFFERED PRESI
DENT McKINLEY HAS BEEN OVER
LOOKED. '
Call Acts Promptly.
Last Thursday evening The Call learned
that a trip to the Mare Island Navy Yard
had been left absolutely out of the pro
gramme prepared for the entertainment
of the President during his stay here, and
it called Â¦ attention ' to the fact In a news
article and. an editorial which appeared
on Friday morning. The ' people of Val
lejo had been fighting hard to secure the
attendance of the President, and they, had
well nigh given up hope of securing any
recognition until The Call mentioned the
matter. As soon as it was brought to the
attention of the readers of The Call, how
ever, they took a new grip on their cam
paign and success has crowned their ef
forts. It is now definitely decided that tho
President shall visit the yard If ho so de
sires and the programme can be arranged
to allow the trip, but in any event the
Secretary of the Navy, who accompanies
him, and all the Congressmen visiting the
State shall be given the time and the op
portunity to visit the greatest naval sta
tion of the coast and one a3 great as any
in the country.

gratitude to The Call and acknowledge

He was born in Guelph, Ontario, m
1838, and it was in 1856 when he reached
St. Paul, young, sturdy, ambitiou^, mon
eyless, hopeful, shrewd, Industrious.- He
was not ashamed, to turn his hand to
manual labor when other opportunities
did not. appear to his taste, but it was
not long before he attracted the atten
tion of older men, and a' year or two
after reaching St. Paul, then a thriving
frontier town- of 6000 inhabitants, he be
came the local agent of a' Mississippi
River steamship company, the - North
western Packet Company, and remained
with the company until 1867.
His First Bailroad.
In the year 1873 a railroad which had
been struggling along in the regionâ the
St. Paul and Pacificâ defaulted on the in
terest on its bonds. There was 533,000,000
in principal and interest outstanding
against the road, the. bonds being held
mainly In Amsterdam. . The outlook for
an early funeral was promising. A young
man who by dint of much hard work and
thrift had accumulated- a fortune of
well on to $100,000â no small sum for the
day and region â made up his mind ' that
here was an opportunity, coming but
once in a lifetime. How to . get hold of
this property with so small a capital was
a problem yet to be solved ; but the
young man, this same "Jim" Hill, wasted
no time In speculation. He said he would
have the road, and have it he did. It
took tremendous work; it involved .ar
rangements of various kinds with men
far more prominent In the financial
world than himself; it called Into play
every element of diplomacy at his com
mand.
It " was not smooth sailing 1 by any
means. Many predicted failure, and a
lesser man would have succumbed. At
last, however, he secured ' control of all
the property, and the St. Paul, Minneap
olis and Manitoba road was born. - air.
Hill became general manager of the new
road, and when it was at last merged
into the present property, the Great
Northern, he became president, a posi
tion which he still holds.
A Power in the Industrial "World.-
From a day laborer on the docks, of
bt. Paul to the presidency of one of the
leading railroads of America, becoming
the confidant and counselor of some of
the leaders of the financial world from
both sides of the ocean, is the stride of
a Colossus. The current newspaper ac
counts of his part in the mighty indus
trial movements of the day suggest that
the world has not yet heard the- last of
him. *Â¦ â "^
In addition to his interest in land trans
portation, Mr. Hill early looked into the
possibilities of the great lakes. He has
not been confined to wheat alone, but
lumber and iron, two commodities easily
transportable by -lake route, have found
ships of his building, while the two
finest passeneer boats on the great lakes
are in commission under. his control. He
has a beautiful steam yacht for his own
private uses, one of the finest afloat.
Perhaps the reasons for the success of
this man may be included in these brief
suggestions: . '
1. Large native _ ability diplomatically
handled. , .
2. An iron will.
3. Supreme confidence in the excellence
of his own - judgment.
If you should add to this a power to
interest men with money to invest per
haps the picture would be more com
plete, for certainly Mr. Hill has the con
fidence of the financial world as but few
men possess it.
The president of the- Great . Northern
Railway Company Is to-day one of. the
confmanding figures in an era of great
financial events. Whatever one may
hold as to the desirability of allowing
one man, or one set of men. to maintain
so powerful a grip upon the industrial
fortes of the -nation, one may not omit
in : any consideration of the subject this
sturdy, compact; sphinxllke, powerful fig
ure, one of the masters of men.
knowledge, so to speak, with the needs of
the Asiatic and how. to satisfy those
needs. '.,, - .
An indication of his appreciation of the
situation, his -grasp of Eastern possibili
ties, is seen In the fact that there are
now building Jn an Eastern shipyard for
the "Steamship company of which Mr. HIH
is the president two steamers for the
trade between the Pacific Coast and the
Orient which will be when completed the
two largest vessels on the oceans. Even
the Deutschland and Oceanic will be
eclispsed by these new leviathians, as
each will be 630 feet long and built to
carry between them a cargo as. great as
could be hauled j?n seventy railroad
trains, each train composed of .twenty-five
of the largest freight cars.
These ships are to run in connection
with Mr. Hill's railroad, and will form no
Inconsiderable factor in the development
of national trade with the Far East.
How Hill Got His Start, j
It does not seem too great a stretch of
statement to call . Mr. Hill a born pro
moter of transportation. It was but a
short time after he arrived in St. Paul
before he became interested In that sub
ject. It was not railroad transportation
that first enlisted his attention, Â¦< nor
steamship transportation: It was, if cur
rent local history Is to be relied upon, a
city dray. When he went to St. Paul
he was a young 'man, not yet out of
his teens. He was ready to do whatever
came to his hand. If he did indeed drive
a dray, be sure he drove it to the best
possible advantage, taking Into account
the prevailing competitive conditions,
and availing himself of every opportunity
to give his patrons a prompt service at a
minimum of expense and a maximum of
tunity and the Man"â A Pen Sketch

but a conquering Saxon, born to rule. â¢
This is an inadequate pen picture of one
of 'tho commanding figures Â¦ -of modern
commercial life, James J. Hill, , president
of the Great Northern Railroad, just now
one of .the leading members of a company
of men, small in numbers but mighty in
financial power, a company that -makes
the world pause and wonder what will be
next, what move tljey will make upon the
fascinating, ever-changing chessboard of
finance; where skill is everything, luck
nothing. '
His Appreciation of Merit.
While perhaps finance, or in a more re
stricted sense, the feature of modern com
mercial life which we call railroading,
might be called the chief passion of his
life, that. to which he gives himself with
an untiring devotion, yet it would be un
fair to set him down as a man of one idea,
and that the size of a piece of gold. In his
beautiful home in the city of St. Paul, on
the show street of that city. Summit ave
nue, Mr. Hill has built for himself and his
large family a noble residence, one of the
finest private residences in the Central
AVest.~ In this residence he built a splen
did art gallery and stocked it with the
best that money could buy.- Years ago he
began buying pictures; as soon, in fact,
as he was able to make investments of
that kind he bought and bought, and he
keeps buying. It is supposed that he has
a gallery in money value worth at least
$1,000,000, but it represents a sum far and
away beyond this, that not-to-be-estimat
ed "sum whicR represents the ever-en
hancing value of great works of art. If
you chance to meet Mr. Hill personally
and you know of a new artist who is sure
to "arrive" â and he does not know of the
same man â be sure you have hit upon a
fruitful topic, for he is ever on the lookout
for the new man in art Just as he is^on
the, lookout for the new man in railroad
ing. He is quick and keen to find and fol
low up merit."
He has devoted himself to art just as
he has devoted himself to everything else,
whole-heartedly. He must know all about
a picture, he must know its genesis, its
author's character, its story. You will
find him, if you chance to be his guest,
as delightful a conversationalist on ,the
subject of pictures as he is direct and
laconic should you meet him in the line of
business.
Practical and Far-Sighted Methods.
Whatever Mr. Hill knows he knows;
there is no half-way matter about it.
When his railroad had grown stronger
and stronger until it was. coming to be
known as a' leading feature of North
western life, he determined to lead the
farmers along tltS lines of his road into
more independent ways â to try to help
them while he helped himself. It is not
every year that the wheat crop is boun
teous;, it is not every wheat region that
has the soil of a Red River Valley be
neath ' it, . rich to prodigality, one which,
while it must some day succumb if not
properly rotated, is yet a soil of marvelous
fecundity. So he began to talk livestock
âbetter stock, finer strains, better milk
ers, better beef cattle, more of them. He
posted himself on the subject; one might
almost say he exhausted the subject. Not'
only did he give advice, but he put it into
practical effect 'on his own stock farm.
- Whenever he was given an opportunity
to make a speech before a body of farm
ers he made itâa terse, forceful, homely
worded speech, direct, understandable,
without frills or furbelows. He told the
â¢farmers they must school themselves . to
become better farmers, to be broad-mind
ed farmeis.'not one-idea farmers.- I sup
pose if the number of farmers throughout
the Northwest who have been aided by
Mr. Hill, in a very direct and practical
way to ' increase and enrich their stock
should be enumerated it -would be found
that the list is a long and striking one.
Naturally, it was to his interests that the
farmers should produce that which would
keep his wheels turning, but it was some
thing far more to their individual interest
than. to his own.
His â¢ Study of the Far East. -
6ne V of the peculiarities of Mr. Hill
though it may hardly, be 'called a pecu
liarity, for it is an attribute of all men
who are masters of their trade â is that
whatever he wants to know about he
wants io know about to the last degree;
he can leave nothing to conjecture. For
example, he saw In the Far East mag
nificent undeveloped possibilities -for for
eign -trade. He is a carrier of trade
products. He set himself to the task of
knowing China, .Japan and the whole
East. It is said that there are few men
in the United States who so thoroughly
know the Orient as does Mr. Hillâ not en
cyclopedic or historical or ethnological
knowledge, necessarily, but that Â¦ which
serves -as a basis for trade present and
trade to come â an intimate, personal

"One of the most desirable posts at
Windsor Castle," says a correspondent of
the Chicago Record; "is that of 'the King's
limner,' who in ancient times decorated
books and manuscripts with initial letters,
and who now prepares the parchment
commissions when his Majesty is pleased
to confer knighthood or some other honor
upon one of his subjects. The man who
now fills the post has extraordinary skill
with the pen and brush, and his diplomas
and certificates were greatly admired for
their exquisite taste and skillful execu
tion.. He receives a salary of $2500 . a
year. The clockmaker at Windsor Castle
receives the same compensation, and It is
his business to keep all the timepieces in
repair. The historiographer, who is sup
poted to keep a, record of events, holds an
hereditary office, with a salary of. $2500 a
year. The master of music. Sir Walter
Parrett, the famous organist, receives
$1500. and arranges concerts for his
Majesty's division. The surveyor of pic
tures is paid $1500, the librarian (who, by
the way. Is Richard R. Holmes, an emi

of plays $1000, the keeper of tfco swans is
paid $300 and the bargemaster, who looks
after the boats used, by -the royCl family

Soft Jobs at Edward's Court.
A city magistrate has had before him
the following case:
A woman boarder in an uptown board
ir.p-house departed from the place a few
days ago, leaving her bill unpaid. In some
way which has not been explained her
false teeth passed into the hands of hsr
landlady, who announced that she would
hold them until the account was settled.
Thereupon the owner of the teeth sued to
recover them, and the court, after carp
fully considering the matter, ordered the
defendant to return them... This was dom*
sfter a good deal of protest, and the
piaintiff, with her powers of articulation
marvelously restored, went on her way re
joirlng.
This case Is by no means as trivial as
It may appear on the surface. It Involves
a question of property rights which vital
ly concerns the social fabric Teeth aro
teeth, be they natural or artificial. anÂ«l

that a set of false one'3 could be seized

ence that those supplied by nature, espe

gold, might be extracted to satisfy a
creditor's judgment
Think of a dentist, armed with a war
rant, coming into your house, and theio
against your will extracting two or three,
gold-filled molars and handing over the
bullion value thereof to your butcher or
the ice man! Had that principle been, up
held there Is no telling the limits to which
the process of confiscation might have
been carried. For if it were applicable to
false teeth it would have been to cork
legs also, and to glass eyes, to wigs and
ear trumpets. The learned judge In the
case under review has clearly taken soud

social system and the unity, even if some

NEILL COMPANY ADMIRABLY GIVES
"LOTTERY OF LOVE" AT CALIFORNIA
OUT on Pacific avenue two ladies
have come as near calling each
other names as ladies of high
social standing dare to. They
have been fighting about a Chi
nese cook, and their quarrel has made
John's salary climb $5 per week. John is
conceded to be without exception the
finest cook on' the avenue. For six years
he ruled the kitchen in one fashionable
home, and the peace and happiness which
always attend good digestion hovered o'er
It. So as not to complicate matters, I will
call the charming mistress who presided
over this horn? Mrs. F.
A bit farther out on the avenue is an
other fashionable home with an equally
charming mistress. This lady, who for
convenience sake I shall call Mrs. T., had
had all sorts of cooks in her kitchen, and
each had proved equally as, unsatisfac
tory. Mrs. T. was almost frantic. The
day set for the marriage of her daughter
was rapidly approaching, and it was as
much as she could do to give her atten
tion to the trousseau without bothering
about the cook. " At this stage in- the
game she had a brilliant idea,; She went
down to Mrs. F.'s home, rang, the bell,
and when John came, in answer to her
ring, offered him then and there $2.50
more per week than Mrs. F. was giving
him. if he would come and do her family
cooking. Â¦ " .
Of course, John went. The brow of Mrs.
T. had just regained its usual serene look,
and her family had for exactly two weeks
enjoyed the blessing of- good cooking,
Â¦when bright and eaxly one morning Mrs.
F. marched up to â¢ Mrs. T.'s door and
tinkled her door-bell. John answered the
ring. Mrs. F. took her cue from a pre
vious conversation John had held with
Mrs. T.. and a few days afterward the
famous cook was back in the F. kitchen,
with the difference that he was earning
$5\more per week than he originally had.
But he was hardly a fortnight in, the F.
cuisine when his mistress 'came' upon, him
unexpectedly, and said: "John, I have
decided to discharge you. I just got you
back out of spite, but my sense of honor
rebels against employing a servant so
easy and ready to be. bought as you are.
You have your two days' notice."* '
Mrs. T. was vainly trying to enjoy burnt
steak for breakfast when John came upon
her. "I come back to you,", he said.
"You allee same give me $2. 50 moreâ same
wages as Mrs. F." Mrs.\T. argued, but
in vain. She looked at the burnt, tough
steak on her plate, and John triumphed, a

I never saw such >a Â¦wealth of gorgeous

that which Mrs. Milton Esberg (Carrie

And I do not believe that a half-hundred

the gift of those outside the immediate
family' of Lillsnthal and Esberg. It is a
lovely thing to have such an extensive
family, especially as in this case, when
each and every name is good for at least
a half-million on 'Change.
Mr. and Mrs. Esberg only flitted, away
for a few days' honeymooning. They are

tures of the Lilienthal-Esberg wedding

BERLIN, May 5.â Although the Boerse
greeted the political developments of last
week Jubilantly they were not sufficient
to inaugurate a bull market. Even in this
city official circles were .gratified at the
fall of Herr von Miquel and Herr Brefelot,
believing that a reform of the Boerse law
is now made more practicable. . The finan
cial reviews point out that the Berlin
Boerse was almost uninfluenced by New
York. While the general tone was rather
flrro, business was very, dull. One feature
of the week was a revival of interest in
domestic loans, owing to the great abun
dance of money. Imperial and Prussian
threes gained 30 pfennings and the new
threes 40 pfennings.
Interest in foreign rentes was very light-
The same is true of bank stock. Munici
pal funds were more quiet.
The American situation continued strong
and the general attitude of the public re
mains skeptical. Nevertheless, says the
Frankfurter Zeitung, some speculators
are buying American railway shares. The
Vossische Zeitung and the Frankfurter
Zeitung profess to have discovered much
disappointment among German holders
because of too early a sale of Americans.
Some Journals continue to warn investors.
" The National Zeitung says to-day:
"The Wall street movement has reached
the bounds of crazy over-confidence and
financiers here are expecting a crash."
J. Pierpont Morgan's purchase of the
Leyland steamship line is discussed. The

"The transaction involves an earnest

BERLIN BDERSE
IS RATHER FIRM
To the Honorable S. E. Kalue. President of
the Senateâ Sir: The resolution of the Senate
requesting an extension of the present regular
session of the Legislature has been presented
to me by the special committee of the Senate.
The law provides for a special session of the
Legislature In case there Is an adjournment
of a regular cession without the enactment of
the necessary appropriations for the conduct
of the government during the succeeding bien
nial period. The Legislature therefore has the
power to compel the calling of a special ses
sion for this purpose. The methods of the
present session have been wasteful of both
time and money, and there is little to show
for a larce expenditure of public funds.
Under the circumstances it seems to me that
It 1* unreasonable for the Legislature to look
for both a. special session and an extension of
the regular cession as well, with their Inev
itable accompanying large expenses.
The delay in enacting the appropriations has
continued to so late a period that all expecta
tion of such legislation before the expiration
of this session by limitation of time appears
now to be hopeless, and the calling of a spe
cial session to be imperative. Such limita
tion of time will, I submit, take effect on
Tuesder, the 50th day of April. â¢
I cannot, therefore, accede to the request of
the Senate, failing euch appropriations. Very
respectfully, SAKFORD B. DOLE.
Sans Souci, April 25, 190L Â¦
Both Houses Work Hard.
The effect of the Governor's decision
Tras to make both houses work hard to
press forward pendine bills as deemed
of chief importance. Last nigrht the Sen
ate completed the second reading of the
county bill after the House, and it will
probably pass third reading: to-day.
Emmeluth has not yet produced his
taxation measures, but the Republican
minority of the Joint Committee on
Finance has turned in a makeshift reve
nue measure. They confess that they
have been working- on the subject the
<?ntire session without coming to any
definite conclusion, and conclude as be
lo?r, at the same time submitting bills to
the same effect:
We recommend that the tax on property be
raised from 1 per cent to 1% per cent; that
the inheritance tax be increased and graded;
that the tax on 'large carts and wagons be in
creased, and that the poll tax be abolished.
The legislative expenses appropriation
of $45,000 was all exhausted day before
yesterday; at least it was down to 45
cents. Yet that very morning a Repre
sentative proposed tne astounding extrav
agance of providing every member with
a fountain pen. He was seriously sup
ported by others, on the plea that it
would save ink. Hoogs ironically moved
in amendment that it be two fountain
pens and a house and lot thrown in.

gambling license bill. Several liquor bills

other merchandise.

decision in the long-standing street rail
way controversy. The Hawaiian Tram
ways Company is adjudged to have
no right to lay a double track since it
elected, when building its line a dozen
years ago, to lay a single track system.
Neither has it the right now to use elec
tricity, having allowed the time limit of
it? amended charter to that effect to
lapse. It is also declared to have no ex
clusive franchise on - any street. On the
other hand, the Honolulu Rapid Transit
and Lir.d Company is adjudged the priv
ilege of lajing its track along King
Ftreet, from Kuuanu Stream to Thomas
Square, a distance of about a mile, par
alleling the Tramways line. This, how
ever, with the reservation that the pub
lis is supposed to be consulted on the
matter.
Last night the House passed on second
reading: a bill giving the Tramways Com
pany the privilege of employing elec
tricity. Â»
The trial of Captain Sodergren and Sec
ond Mate Stuart of the bark Hesper
for assault on the high seas is still on
in the Federal court. The captain has to
face another indictment of the same kind
Elnply.
A case of smallpox has appeared among
Porto Ricans on the island of Kauai, who
were landed at Honolulu by the steamer
Zealandia six weeks ago. All mails from
the mainland are fumigated here now
through fear of infection. The Board
of Health finds that it has this power,
but not that of placing quarantine re
strictions upon passengers from ports
not declared infected.
The Federal Grand Jury made its re
port to I'nited States Judge Estee yes
terday. The report, like the charge to
the jury, deals largely with the stock
ade at iTvilei. The Jury finds that the
laws regarding such places are being
violated, as well as the laws regarding
involuntary servitude; but says that evi
dence to warrant prosecutions cannot be
floured against any individuals. It is
recommended that the stockade be abol
ished.

' ST. PETERSBURG, May 5.â The Young
Men's Society for Moral and Physical De
velopment, founded in St.'- Petersburg by
James Stokes .'of .New York under, the
protection of Prince Alexander of Olden
burg, celebrated this evening its first six
months of existence. Prince Alexander
opened the meeting and addresses were
delivered by President Tevaninoff and
Secretary Sidironoff. '.
The objects of th& society are virtually
Identical with the Young Men's Christian
Association in the United States. The so
ciety now has nearly 800 members. Two
members have been elected to the June
conference of the Young Men's Christian
Association in Boston and will attend the
function. . , .
Although the entire trans-Siberian rail
way is now open for~ traffic Americans
should not fall into the error of. assum
ing that a journey -by rail between Vladi
vostok and Moscow is yet possible. The
line ends at the. Chinese frontier and the
Manchurian railway will not be finished
this year, i River 'traffic continues exceed
ingly difficult. _ v
M. de "Witte, Minister of Finance, has
received a delegation representing share
holders of the International Bank, who
have been urging^him to inspect the bank
and inquire into the methods of manage
ment. The Minister promised to give the
petition his consideration.

The cabin passengers on the Zealandia
were: Judge G. D. Gear. W. J. de Gear,

M. Abril, W. B. Smith, Major Ennis. U.

Taylor, J. H. Pierce, L. J. Taylor and Mrs.
W. A". Hardy.
Judge Gear only recently went to Ha
waii to accept a United States Judgeship.
Before leaving for the islands he became
engaged to an Eastern lady. - He was
hardly settled in Honolulu before news
arrived that his betrothed was seriously
111. Judge Gear at once took passage on
the Zealandia and will, hurry East by
train this evening. :,
Wray Taylor is Commissioner of, Agri
culture in Hawaii. He comes here with
a letter of introduction from Governor
Dole to Hon. James Wilson, Secretary of
Agriculture, who Is expected here with
the Presidential party. Mr. Taylor will
invite Secretary Wilson to pay a visit to
the islands, and will also talk over Ha
waiian agricultural matters. ..--'
M. Abril is editor and proprietor of a
Porto v RIcan paper. He has been to Ha

The Oceanic steamship Company's Zea
landia arrived from Honolulu at noon yes
terday. She was a day behind time owing
to being detained in the islands. A. L.
Conlon, a fireman on the steamshipi
struck Patrick McEntee, a water tender,
over the head with a monkeywrench. At
one time it was thought the unfortunate
water tender would die, and Conlon was
put in irons. When the Zealandia arrived
at Honolulu, however, McEntee was con
siderably better, so the fireman was
charged with assault with a deadly weap
on. His trial came off the day the Zea
landia was to *ail. and as Captain Dow
dell, Surgeon Clarke and several of the
crew were under subpena as witnesses the
departure of the vessel had to be post
poned. Judge Estee gave Conlon four
months on the reef at hard labor. Â¦

Is a Day Behind Time Owing to De-
ZEAIiAlSTDIA ARRIVES.
Sodergren did not help his case any by
beating a Hawaiian who was working on
the Hesper over the head with. a piece of
chain a few days before the trial came off.
December larst the Hesper started again
for Honolulu from Newcastle. There was
trouble during the run and the forecastle
hands had a hard time of it. March 31
last the. bark arrived at her dlstination,
and Edward Hamlln and R. Carpenter at
once went ashore and filed complaints
against Captain F. O. Sodergren and
Mate Nelson Stuart. All the members of
the crew were 'held as witnesses, and
when the casp came to trial they told a
straightforward tale. The result was the
conviction of both master and mate.
The Hesper was on her way from New
castle, Aus.. to Hawaii with a load of
coal. The men asserted they were ill
treated, so one night they mutinied, killed
Mate Fitzgerald and attempted to seize
Captain Sodergren 'and his wife. It was
their intention to murder the captain, and
his money and wife were then to be com
mon property. There was no navigator
aboard, however, and some of " the men
became frightened and sided with the
captain. The ringleaders were overpow
ered and the 'Hesper put into Tahiti. From
there the mutineers were brought to San
Francisco, tried and executed.
After that Captain Sodergren and the
Hesper were not heard of very often un
til she became long overdue at Kaichau
with a load of lumber from this coast.
Later it was learned that she had been
thrown on her beam ends during a hur
ricane, and for weeks Captain Sodergren
and his wife lived on the deckload of
lumber, with nothing but a spare eail for
a covering. The bark eventually made the
Chinese coast, and on her arrival at Kai
chau Prince Henry of Prussia, who was
there In a German warship, went aboard
the Hesper and complimented Captain
Sodergren on his seamanship.
Everybody will remember the deter
mined fight that General "Jim" Smith
made to save the necks of the "Ilesper
murderers." He carried their' case to the
court of last resort, but his clients had
to pay the penalty.
a^poHERE is perhaps no better known
I bark that sails the seas than the
I Hesper of San Francisco. Captain
Ji F. O. Sodergren has been her mas
ter for years, and he is almost as
â¢well known as the vessel he (commands.
The news came by the Zealaridia yester
day that this master mariner had been
found guilty of "cruelty on the high seas"
by a jury In Judge Estee's court at Hono
lulu, and that his chances for spending a
year on the reef were extremely good.
The Sterling Company swore out a war
rant for Lester's arrest on a charge of
obtaining money by false pretenses, and
he fled to Los Angeles. He returned to the
city yesterday morning and was going to
San Jose. The detectives learned of the
fact and shadowed his wife, who lived
with her sister on Stockton street. She
went to Fourth and Townsend streets to
meet him, and when he made his appear
ance the detectives arrested him.
Lester married recently in this city. His
wife was a waitress in a restaurant on
Grant avenue, between Geary and Post
streets, at the time.
Lester is a young man and has appar
ently had a good education. He belongs
to Xew Tork and came here about a year
ago with a regiment from the East. He
was discharged recently. His graft has
been to go into a store and order a small
quantitj' of goods. He would give a worth
less check in payment In excess of the
value cf the goods and receive cash for
the balance.
Lester went to the store of the John
Breuner Company. 957 Market street.
April IT and ordered a rug. which cost $10,
to be sent to 1221 Bush street. He gave
in payment a check for $37 40 on the First
National Bank, payable to Charles S. Wil
bur and purporting to be signed by L. P.
Fisher. He got $27 40 in cash. When the
rug was sent to the address the occu
pants of the house said they had not or
dered it. and when the check was pre
sented at the bank it was found to be
worthless. Two days later Lester called
at the store of the Sterling Furniture
Companv and ordered some goods which
cost ?22 40. He gave in payment a check
for $37 40 on the Columbian Bank, payable
to himself and purporting to be signed by
Robert H. Feder. The goods were sent to
a house on Post street, but the occupants
said they had not ordered them and the
check was found to be worthless. Lester
also played the same trick on Gullixsen
Bros.. 955 Market street.
Joseph M. Lester, formerly a soldier,
was arrested yesterday afternoon, by De
tectives Wren and Coleman and was

obtaining money by false pretenses and
possibly two charges for forgery will be
booked against him.

WOMAN DROWNED
IN SAN JOAQUIN
Jumps Overboard From
â¢' v ''a River Steamer
- Weber From Stockton
Ends Her Life.
A woman whose name .was not learned
â¢ at Night.
Passenger . on the Captain
jumped overboard from the river steamer
! Captain Weber, en route from "Stockton
to 'this city, Saturday' night and was
drowned. It was a deliberate suicide, as
the woman left her hat, shoes and nearly
all her underclothing in her stateroom,
and walking to the rail climbed over and
jumped into the river. , The alarm was
given and in a few minutes the steamer
was stopped and a boat lowered. No sign
of the unfortunate woman could be found,
so reluctantly >the search had to be aban
doned. The Captain Webe? arrived in San
Francisco early yesterday morning.
, Among the passengers who boarded the
steamer at 2 Stockton were " a man and
woman who purchased tickets for. this
city. Purser Joseph S. Hale assigned the
couple, who represented- themselves to be
man and wife, to room 33. About 9:30 p.
m:, when the "Weber was making Brad
ford landing the man came running for
ward, excitedly yelling, "Stop the ship;
woman overboard!"
Pilot D. McNeill, who was in charge, at
once stopped the vessel and ordered a
boat lowered. The searchlight was
brought into service, but'there was'abso
lutely nothing to show where the woman
had gone down. '. * .
In the meantime Captain Dye had come
on deck and took command. He sent for
the man, and to the questions asked the
latter gave ready answers. He said the
woman was known as his wife and they
had lived together for six years. There
was no marriage." The Â¦ deceased was
about 30 years of. age. T She â¢ had often
threatened when "despondent to commit
suicide.
â¢ The man said the woman seemed in good
spirits when leaving Stockton, and looked
forward .to settling down ; in Sacramento,
whither they were bound. About 9:30 p. m.
Saturday she asked him to get a pitcher
of water. He went aft and got the water
and was returning to his stateroom when
the, woman ran out, and ' calling out
"good-by" climbed upon Â¦ the rail and
jumped into the river.

AMONG the many San Francisco
artists who have gone abroad
to acquire knowledge and fame
Earl Cunimmgs, a former
student of th j Mark ' Hop
kins Institute of Art, is the latest
to win recognition in Paris. From
information received yesterday by his
father, M. E. Cummings, who is em
ployed in 1 a responsible position in the
Board of .Public Works, it appears that;
Earl has just completed his first work,
entitled "A Portrait Bust," which has
been accepted by the Paris Salon. The"
subject .from whom . the bust was sculp
tured is a young lady, who posed as for a
photograph. She is a dear friend of the
Cummings family and is also studying art
In the French capital.
Earl Cummings left this city last Sep
tember to pursue his chosen calling, and
he is. at present studying under . the
famous sculptor Mercie, who is justly
proud of his pupil, as are also his friends
and his family here. The fact that Earl's
initial effort in sculpturing was accepted
by the Salon is certainly a guarantee of
his ability. - . "â¢ .
I. A specimen of Mr. Cummings' handi-
work now occupies a space in a window
on the California street side of the Hop
kins Institute. It is a life-size figure
called "Love and Death."- The clever
young sculptor was principal assistant to
Douglas Tilden, who designed the Dona
hue monument, which is to be dedicated
to the mechanics of San Francisco, during
President McKinley's visit. From', present
Indications this city will have another
name added to the bright galaxy of
artists whom she can claim as her own. â¢

. Thousands of the German-Americans
of Oakland and San Francisco took part
in the May festival to-day at the Alten
heim, the German Old People's Homo
at Fruitvale. The weather was in per
fect harmony with the elaborate prepar
ations that the various committees had
made. The beautiful grounds and
buildings were overrun with merrymak
ers and all day long there was a contin
ual round of entertainment for young and
old alike. The directory of the AltenÂ»
Â¦helm took pride in exhibiting the Institu
tion to their guests, while the aged In

festival march of the directors. The com
bined singing vereins rendered selec
tions. .
Professor . Albln Putzer of the Univer-i
sity of California was the orator of the
day. The professor referred to the mar
riage of spring and winter, the occasion
for the celebration. He recited the
many charms of the Altenheim and
bowed with reverence to the aged people
who had come there to end their days in
peace and quiet, surrounded by all of the
beauties and charm of nature's best glft3.
He declared that honor should be paid to
old age and that there wei*B none too
young to learn ' respect for gray hairs.
The speech was followed by choral selec
tions. The festival poem, written by H.
Glauch, was recited delicately by Miss
Linda Priber. Miss Hochmelster sang
"The; Star Spangled Banner" with choral
accompaniment. The audience united In

Solomon Lewis, a" pioneer "of -California,
who opened one of the first hotels in San
Francisco, drooped dead this afternoon
at : 3 o'clock while walking on Seventh,
street, near Webster.: The aged pedestri
an had left his residence at 854 Alice street
only a few minutes before death called
him. and was enjoying a walk in thte sun
shine when he was so suddenly struck. Â«
The cause of death will have to be de
termined by a. post mortem examination.
For some time Mr. Lewis had been in
feeble health and under the care of a
physician. His condition was such . that
his family feared that the end might
come as suddenly as it did.
Among the Jewish people of the State
there are few better known throughout
California than was "Old Man Lewis," as
he was familiarly styled by his many
friends. He left his home in Poland as a
youth and came to the United States,
stopping a short time in New York. The
news of the gold strike In California at
tracted the young man and by 1850 he was
in San Francisco, where he went into the
hotel business, establishing a hostelry on
Sansome street that became famous
among the early residents of the city by
the Golden Gate. , , . , . >. ,'
As a pioneer - institution Lewis' hotel
was noted for its elegrance. Among his
guests was J. Seligman, now. head of one
of the great financial houses of New York
and London. The old- gentleman had
many reminiscences of the early life of
the men whose names became a part of
the history of the State.
â¢During the last twenty years Mr. Lewis
lived In Oakland and conducted a. jewelry
business on Seventh street, near Wash
ington. His shop is a landmark of the
city - -.v/'. *Â¦â¢â¢â¢'Â¦-
Â¦He was active in fraternal onranizations
for many years, being affiliated with the
Masons, the Odd Fellows, the Leelon of
Honor and the Independent 1 Order of
B'nai B'rith. Deceased was 72 years of
age. His surviving family is composed of
his wife and three childrenâ Mrs. Lee
Hechheimer of Chicago, who is now here
with her husband on a visit: Miss Gertie
Lewis of this city and George Lewis, a

"The evidence is plain that the fire was
deliberately started. On the ground, plain
ly visible, was a half-burned match that
was used, in my opinion, to start the
flames. It looks as if the incendiary had
placed a lot of inflammable stuff between
the shed and the small redwood boxlike
structure that had recently been built on to
the side of the building. There is no other
way the fire could have got such a start.
The burned portion of the woodwork is
ell on the outside of the building, showing
that the fire was not started from with
in."
A peculiar circumstance in connection
with this flre is the fact that it occurred
within two blocks of a double attempt at
burning the residence at 936 Filbert street
jiust two weeks ago. The police and fire
department officials attribute these fires
to the work of a "crank." The evidence
in the first case was plain. Big bunches
cf newspapers were stuffed between a
swinging door and the back door of the
residence and set afire. Boys saw the
flames in time to save the place, then
tenantless. An hour later an outhouse
was discovered in flames, a pile of news
papers having been fired. Neighbors ex
tinguished that blaze. The fire at the
Horton school was so similar in character
that an effort is being made to trace some
connection between the three mysterious
occurrences.
"While sitting by the window she no
ticed the flames, and without waiting to
call for assistance playea fireman herself,
with great success.
"It was fortunate that this attempt oc
curred when ;t did," explained Mr. Ben
fon to-day, after reporting the occurrence
to the police. "Saturday nights I am de
tained at the store- late, and it was on
that account that Mrs. Benson had not
retired.
To make sure that she had conquered
the flames. Mrs. Benson tore away a
email wooden ornamental J structure at
tached to the side of the shed, between
the boarding of which and the main build
ing the tire had evidently been started.
Assured that the fire was extinguished.
Mrs. Benson gathered up her apparatus
and returned to her home, where she had
been awaiting the homecoming of her
husband from his place of employment,
with \V. I. Reed, a grocer on Clay street,
near Twelfth.
Her well-directed efforts quenched the
Tire after it had burned a hole two feet
square in the rustic boarding and had
left a big mass of charred wood to mark
the failure of the incendiary to accom
plish .his purpose.
The flames that threatened the building
were seen by Mrs. Benson at 11 o'clock
from an upper-story window of her resi
dence, which overlooks the rear of the
Horton school. The plucky woman did
\ptot stand upon ceremony, neither did she
scream or give way in any manner to sud
den emotion. Instead Mrs. Benson rushed
down Ftairs. dragged a length of garden
hose through a gateway separating the
schoolyard from her garden and quickly
had a stream playing on the burning
woodwork of the latticed annex that was
eJl ablaze. -'â¢'-';
Only the presence of mind and prompt
action of Mrs. Alanson Benson, residing at
H16 Filbert street, saved the large frame
building at the northeast corner of
Twelfth and Filbert streets, occupied by
Miss Sarah W. Horton's private school,
from being destroyed last night by a fire
v/hich bears all of the earmarks of in
cendiary origin.

Benjamin J. Smith and
His Wife &gree to
I Separate.
Out of Apparent Harmony
Bursts Sudden Storm
of Discord.
That there should- have been a separa
tion in the family is a source of surprise
and regret to many who know them.
Mrs. Smith has been secretary and one
of the active workers and soloists of the
club almost from its inception. She is also
the possessor of no little dramatic and lit
erary ability, as has been shown by some
of her recent work. She has written sev
eral little farces and dramatic bits, two
of which were produced and had to be
reproduced in behalf of the music com
mittee of the Unitarian Church, so great
was their success. One of these was the
little farce entitled "Kleptomaniac,', 1
which was written without a male part
in the cast. .â¢Â¦â¢Â¦- â¢' Â¦ - .-Â¦
Mrs. Margaret Cameron-Smith is known
as one of the brightest women in Oakland.
She is one of the leaders in the musical
Â¦world and has taken an interest in the
Hughes Club for Â¦ several years.t_Thls is
the leading female musical organization
in Oakland, and almost of the coast.
"There have been some little differences
between myself and Mrs. Smith which
are family matters. It is not of recent
occurrence,' but the cause is purely a
family one and one that I do not care to
discuss. In fact, the difficulty has only
come to a head with the announced de
termination of Mrs. Smith to leave home.
Mrs. Smith's musical and amateur
dramatic interests have had nothing to do
with the differences. She nas great abil
ity and talent in both of these lines that
has been recognized and I have never in
terfered In the least with the exercise of
her talents. Any impression that the do
mestic difficulties have been the out
growth of her musical and literary work
is not true."
Benjamin J. Smith and his wife are well
known in Oakland. Ke is one of the lead
ing general insurance agents in San Fran
cisco, a man in receipt of a large income,
and of esthetic tastes. He has built with
in the last year a magnificent residence
on the top of Linda Vista Terrace, and
fitted and furnished it in the most sumpt
uous style. There he has lived with his
wife, his mother and his sister.
Has Literary and Musical Tastes. '<
The Husband's Statement.
The harmony of the family of Benjamin
J. Smith is sadly out of tune. The mar
riage bells are all a-jangle. The demon
of domestic difficulty has driven Cupid
out of doors, and it Is now only a ques
tion of a settlement, for the separation
has already taken place between Mr.
Smith and. his wife, Margaret Cameron-
Smith.
There has been trouble brewing in the
household of Mr. and Mrs. Smith that
reached a culmination during the past
week. Mrs. Margaret Cameron-Smith left
her husband's roof, and now the work of
settling property matters is in progress.
This has all taken place so quietly that
few, even of the most intimate friends of
the family, knew what was going on in
the handsome home on the summit of
Linda Vista Terrace. Everything has
been, to all appearances, as harmonious
as the melody of song that Mrs. Smith
loved so well, and as happy as the little
dramas that she produced, but behind it
all there has been trouble and discord.
This discord has been suppressed, even
while negotiations for a settlement were
in progress. . :
Mrs. Margaret Cameron-Smith is not at
her husband's home. This Mr. Smith ad
njitfc, and he says that she has announced
that she will not return. "Mrs. Smith is
not at home this evening," he said; "but
1 cannot Â«ay that she has definitely left
home. She has not removed her belong
ings, but she has announced a determi
nation to separate.

SICK SCHOOL CHILDREN.
A Teacher Speaks of the Cause.
I have charge of the second grade in
the public schopls here, and trace nearly
every case of headache among these chil-
dren to Improper feeding. When a sick
child is asked what was had for break-
fast, the reply almost universally includes
a cup of coffee.
An illustration is that of my sister's
eldest boy, Will Wilson of Lennox, Iowa.
For a long time he had no appetite for
breakfast, but insisted on coffee, which
they would give him, weakened some with
cream, but no matter how little coffee he
had it brought on his bad spells. Since
they have been using Postum Food Coffee
in their family the boy Is well, and can
have all of the Postum Coffee he wants
for breakfast.
I was ordered by my physician to Quit
tbe use of coffee some time ago, for my
sick spells were directly traceable to It,
but I could not quit its use until I found
Postum. Then the change did not disturb
me in the slightest. The old troubles have
disappeared.
I . have a long list of friends who use
PoEtum and enjoy it very much, but in
every case they have had to learn that
Postum is only good when It is boiled long
enough to bring out the flavor. â Margaret

McClosky and McDonald both have un
savory jeputations. . McClosky's mother
runs - a- little furniture <and second-hand
store on Mission street, near Twenty
nin-th, and he 1 depends upon her for his
support. McDonald was for a time an ex
traman with one of the engine companies.
The police arrested his brother yesterday
afternoon on the supposition that he was
McClosky's companion. When the mis
take was discovered the brother was re
leased. . -
Harrison- and Mrs. Mulholland agree
substantially on this account of the out
rage. McClosky claims that he and his
"companion, Gano McDonald, were pass
ing the Harrison place and heard the
woman screaming for help. He says they
went' in and found Harrison beating the
woman . and â¢ made him desist, and that
after he had sunken Into a drunken sleep
they-left the house.-
Mrs. Mulholland says It ! was twenty
minutes. to 4 o'clock when they left; and
that , she sat â¢ up the remainder of- the
night and in the morning, against Harri
son's wish, went out and telephoned to
the Seventeenth-street police station. The
patrol wagon was sent and she was taken
to the City and County Hospital. .It was
found that she had four ribs broken, and
had received a bad cut across the fore
head and another on her lip. â¢ .
' Mrs. Mulholland has been separated
from her husband for seven years. She
has a married daughter living in Sacra
mento^ .
' Mrs. Mulholland, who is 54 years old, la
housekeeper for E. C Harrison, a painter,
Hying at 410 Eugenia avenue. Harrison
went home about 1 o'clock Sunday, morn
ing Very "much intoxicated. . He. and Mrs.
Mulholland claim that some time after his
arrival they heara men outside trying the
fastenings ot the windows. Mrs. Mulhol
land says that she went to the front door
and opened it and two men sprang Into
the hallway, 'j One of â¢ them, whom she
claims she recognized as McClosky, seized
her and threw her upon the-floor. Har
rison was aroused from , his . semi-stupor
by her shrieks and tried to come to her
assistance, but McClosky's^ companion
knocked him back upon the' bed. and held
him there. McClosky continued his strug
gle with the woman until, maddened by
her resistance, he began beating her un
mercifully and finally ended by kicking
her , in the â¢ side and . stamping upon her
breast.; He and hi3. companion then de
parted, leaving Mrs.- Mulholland imore
dead than alive. â¢
Mrs. Mary Mulholland of Bernal Heights
is lying on a cot at the City and County
Hospital suffering from Injuries inflicted
upon her in a brutal assault- at an early
hour Sunday morning, and James McClos
ky-is locked, up at. the City Prison,
charged' with being her assailant.

The benediction was pronounced by Past

the memorial services closed with "Amer
ica,", played by- the orchestra while the
entire audience remained standing. -.''Â¦.-,.
It is not what others do for us, but what we
dofor ourselves that constitutes monuments by
which we shall be remembered. Noble example
flres the soul; .eood deeds make our path on
earth; a flowery one. By these shall we be re
membered and not by the work of the sculptor.
Thos'6 who have achieved good. deeds need no
work of the sculptor to tell us that they, lived.
So it is with the lives of those whose memory
we revere to-day and at all. times. Such were
our loved sisters who have passed away. I Let
our teare fall, but not in sorrow. As we think
of them we, needs must weep. Let us remember
as our tears fall that they have gone to a realm
where, there is no sorrow. Our departed ones
would, if they could speak, wish us to live, not
,for self, but for our friends and our beloved
order. When the call of death comes to ua, may
we, like our beloved sisters, lay down the bur
den so that those left behind may say that they
and our order benefited, by knowing us." -
Sister Etta O'Brien sang a sacred song
and was followed by the Press Club
Quartet, which feelingly rendered the
"Miserere." ' '
Those we honor to-day need no monument to
remind us of their worth. "We Native Daughters
of the Golden West require no reminder of the
loved ones who : have passed to the hereafter.
Their . deeds in life are the monuments they
themselves erected for all time. Life is all too
ehort to -allow us. to do our alloted work. Our
task is to erect- a monument for ourselves that
shall remain for all time. The crumbling work
of sculptors have received the tears of those
left to mourn. Costly monuments sink to decay.
Mourners and mourned alike sink into forget
fulness, while the deeds of life remain, for all
time. . Â¦ Â¦ . â¢ Â¦ . . Â¦'â¢ .

We Coming To?'- The speaker reviewed
at length ; the ' growth cf the centraliza
tion of , capital and : claimed that present
conditions were- the- menace of the few
against the many. . He placed, trusts . in
the same category as | the ownership of
land by the ; aristocrats in Europe : that
neither theVmen in the, trusts; the
landowning, aristrocrats had secured Â¦ their
property by giving a proportionate equiv
alent. The speaker argued that while the
trusts might have a so-called legal right
to " their - property/, they, did' not : possess
any moral right to it. He- believed that
common honesty would some , day, give to
every man a share of the world's goods
due to him and the race of mankind, would
be happier. :-'..A.' short general discussion

HELD AT PAVILION
SIMPLK, yet impressive - In their
simplicity, were the memorial ser
vices held yesterday afternoon by
the Native Daughters of the Gold
en West of Alameda 1 and San
Francisco counties as a token of regard
of deceased members of the order.
The services were held In the large Na
tive Sons' Hall on Mason street and at
tracted a large audience, mainly com
posed of members of the fair "sex. The
hall was draped in purple and black, re
lieved by shields and flags of the national
colors. The stage was draped in similar
colors and was banked with" ferns and
flowers. At the right of the stage the
silken banner of the Grand Parlor of the
I Native Daughters hung half-mast from
its gold-mounted pole, and across the
stage was stretched the impressive words
in white letters, "We mourn our departed
sisters."
In former years it was the custom for
the various parlors to hold Individual me
morial services, but this year, by the en
ergetic work of Miss Lizzie Douglas of
Alta Parlor, it was arranged that the par
lors of Alameda and San Francisco coun
ties should combine and venerate the
memory of their dead sisters by orie grand
service.
The arrangements for the memorial
services were made by a committee con
sisting of Mrs. C. S. Baker, chairman;
Miss Burke, vice chairman, and Miss Jes
sie Creighton, secretry. Â¦ Â¦
On Saturday last the graves of the dead
sisters of the parlors were decorated with
flowers by loving hands, while yesterday
an unostentatious tribute was paid to
their memory at the services held. . . . .. .. Â¦
Memory of Dead Revered.
The exercises opened with the rendition
of Chopin's superb funeral march by
Blum's orchestra, and was followed by
the address of the grand vice president.
Sister Genevieye Baker.
The speaker In part said:
Our gathering here Is one of sadness, yet. In
view of all things, it Is one of Inspiration. .The
emblems of mourning we see around us speak
in solemn language. They tell us of death com-,
ing to all. beckoning the sisters who are l here
as the sisters we revere were beckoned. Many
have responded to the I call and have passed
through the door to which we must all make our
way. From the dawn of creation that law has
existed and will exist for all time. ,
Life at best Is a long and tedious-anarch, filled
with alternate"; triumphs and sorrows. Yet, after
all our successes and defeats, our (rains and
losses, we finally enter on the sleep of death.
Out of all this struggle It Is wellAhat we do
some one thtng for the benefit of? humanity.
Like those who 'have passed away, let us strive
to do some one thing and then gladly Join the
ranks In heaven under the Great Captain who
Is over all. It behooves us to follow the exam
ple of our dead sisters. Let us give our love to
our sisters on earth: let us be kind to all; let
our lives be frentle and womanly, so that when
we are called upon to enter the Grand Parlor
on high, we shall have no need for regrets. â¢

George Seesenie, a striking waiter, was
taken into custody yesterday and con
fined in the insane ward at the City Hall.
The loss of his mind is due to an intense
Interest in labor troubles and religious
subjects.
Striking: "Waiter Goes Insane.
Rev. William E. Dugan, pastor of the
Stewart Memorial Presbyterian Church,
preached a sermon to his congregation
last night. He chos* as his subject the
question of "Labor." He discussed the
conditions existing between labor and
capital at the present time.
Pastor Speaks of Labor Troubles.
Members of the executive committee of
the San Francisco Labor Council had a
conference at headquarters during the
afternoon to discuss the situation, but
took no decided action in following up the
line of action suggested by the Council on
Friday night.
The restaurant proprietors are still as
confident of victory as ever. In many
places during *he day the attendance was
up to the normal. In some places where
the pickets had been most effective here
tofore the police officers on duty found
their only work to be to gaze upon the
good things to eat displayed in the win
dows and loosen their belts in anticipa
tion of quitting time.
While the Carriage Makers* Association,
of which H. M. Black Is th^ chairman,
â¢was disposed to grant the two most im
portant demands of the men. it was not
disposed to recognize the union. A strike
â¢was originally planned for to-day, but
after a long discussion it was decided in
stead to hold a conference with Black
and other carriagemakers and endeavor
to formulate some plan by which the
three unions might be recognized. Some
resuJt will be reached by to-morrow night,
when the three unions will again meet at
the Temple.
The striking cooks and waiters rested
after their demonstration of Saturday
night, and in many places no patrol was
maintained. The reason for this is said
at headquarters to be that the increase in
the number of restaurants that have
adopted the union schedule is so rapidly
growing that many of their men and
women are being called off the street.
It is claimed that three kitchen crews
will leave as many of the more prom
inent restaurants to-day unless the pro
prietors agree to union regulations. Seven
applications from- proprietors of restau
rants in different parts of the city were
received and acted upon. One restaurant,
at 416V4 Ellis street, of which Mrs. C. I.
Howell Â¦was the proprietress, closed its
doors at noontime. It is said the restau
rant will not reopen. So far it is alleged
that almost or.e-third of all the restau
rants are unionized.
Another strike is In the air. The men
connected with the carriage making in
dustry held a meeting yesterday morning
at the Turk-street Temple. There were
about 200 blacksmiths, carriage painters
and carriage builders present, besides
President Goff apd Secretary Rosenberg
of the Labor Council and National Or
ganizer Pierce. Some time ago the work
men demanded nine hours a day, an in
crease in pay and the recognition of their
unions.

FOR THE HUNGRY
The third anniversary ... of the" organiza
tion of the Volunteer -Leasrue, an adjunct
of the Young Men's Christian Association,
Â¦was celebrated Â¦with appropriate exercises
yesterday- afternoon in _the association
auditorium on ! Mason and Ellis streets.
The object of the league, is i the'propaga
tion of Christian work among the young
men of less Â¦ favorable lands, especially
Japan. . ,'Â¦.'.-Â¦, . -
Seated on the stage were CM. .Whit
ney," president of the Volunteer Leayue;
Frank Hanschild, treasurer; Alexander
Gardner, secretary; Henry J. McCoy, sec
retary of the Y. M. C. A.; and Rev. H. H.
Bell and Rev. Frederick W. Clampett,
rector of , Trinity Episcopal Church; vho
delivered an> address on the subject, "The
Extension; of the King-dom of Â¦, Christ
Among Younjj Men." - ' '
:' After a prayer by Rev. Dr. H. H. Bell, a
hymn sung by the congregation of ladles
and gentlemen assembled and â¢ the rendi
tion of a vocal number by the Knicker
bocker quartet, President Whitney briefly
outlined the work, accomplished by the
league in Japan. He stated that under tne
supervision of Galen 'M. Fisher, interna
tional I traveling secretary, the Japanese
young men were fast being enrolled under
the banner of the- association for the fur
therance of Christian principles. An asso
ciation building had been erected in Toklo,
where several hundred converts gathered
to hear the Gospel explained. "An extraor
dinary effort. Mr. â¢ Whitney said, would.be
made to support a general secretary in
Japan next year. One hundred members
of the league we.re at present contributing
to the expense of the foreign department
of the association work and' he urged
those present to join in order to help the
good cause along. â¢ .
After; th<> singing of a solo by Mrs.
Dickie, accompanied by Mrs. Grandhman,
Rev. Dr. Clampett delivered his address.
In which he spoke of the commendable
work In which the league was engaged,
that of Christianizing the 'people of less
favored s lands. He referred to the fact
that this city possesses the distinction .of.
being the first to organize the Volunteer
League and that through its efforts 'the
foreign work is taking a strong hold, es
pecially among the Japanese. He conclud
ed by saying that no worthier cause ex
isted than that which the league Â¦ was'
fostering. > ..'...- .Â¦<Â¦_Â¦.

BOYCOTT!
Suppose, through your Industry and
,,' ravings, you ooen a store, and the In-
vestment represents your all, and then a.
lot of Irresponsible clerks, without a'
dollar at etake, order you to close your
etore at 6 p. m. to suit their personal con-
venlence, and you explain to them why
you cannot do so without losing your
money Invested, but are willing to let
your clerks go at that hour and they
1 reply close at 6 or we will make you.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
TTouldn't you continue In your business
and allow your clerks to co at 6 p. m;
endeavor to be honest with your custom-
ers, yourself and the clerks, as I have
done for the last ten weeks?
I think you would.
Come down some evening and see
