DEL MONTE, Nov. 17.â The travel
ing passenger agents had a
grand time here to-day. When
they left their special cars at the
siding near the hotel shortly
after S o'clock they were greeted with a
beautiful view of Del Monte. The hotel
and grounds never looked better. The
weather was perfect and the Eastern rail

After breakfast the party, which num
bered about 300, was divided into two
sections. One party took the seventeen

themselves by visiting the golf links,
maze and swimming bathp. After lunch
those who had not already taken the

a speech of welcome to the visitors. It

by stating that the cashier of the hotel

W. A_ Junker had instructed him not to
take any of the railroad men's money.
TARDY DEALING
WITH BRIGANDS
Hardships Imperil Miss Stone's Life
While Futile Negotiations Are
Being Conducted on
Her Behalf.
SOFIA, Bulgaria, Nov. 17.â The brigands
vho abducted Miss Ellen M. Stone, the
American missionary, and Mine. Tellka,
her companion, have not yet replied to
the last proposals of Mr. Dickinson, diplo
matic agent of the United States in Sofia.
This Is believed to be due to the fact
that the band has many leaders, and that
the latter are unable to agree among
themselves.
There is a general impression here that
time is being frittered away while waiting
for the brigands to reduce their demands.
It Is felt that the only means by which
matter* can be brought to a head is to
Inform them as to the sum available for
ransom and to declare that this cannot
b* Increased for any consideration what
ever. Such an ultimatum might endanger
the life of Miss Stone, but it is more
probable that the brigands would accept
this condition.
Beside, every day's delay imperils her
life, not so much on the score of the
brigands themselves, but by reason of the
exposure and strain she is undergoing.

LONDON, Nov. 17.â Saturday's fog,
which was general throughout the United

BIG BUTTLES
TO BE FOUGHT
IN CONGRESS
House and Senate Look
Forward to Bitter
Contests.
Roosevelt's Trust-Regulation
Project Likely to Be
Opposed
Ship Subsidies, Reciprocity, Revenue
Reduction and the Isthmian
Canal Are Among Bones
of Contention.
Special Dispatch to The^Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â Ship subsi
dies, reciprocity, revenue reduction, the
isthmian canal and the trusts â these are
already looming up as big bones of con
tention in the coming Congress.
Senator Frye of Maine is expected in
Washington some time next week, bring
ing a new subsidy bill. Senator Hanna
will be in the van of the subsidy warriors.
They will lind plenty of opponents.
Reciprocity, too, will tind its enemies â
not the reciprocity that Mr. Blalne urgad,
nor yet the reciprocity of McKinley, but
many schemes of tarirt reduction that will
be presented under the high-sounding title
of "reciprocal relations." Many are anx
ious for the President's words on this
matter, as it is known that he holds
strong views.
Representative Payne of New York, who
will succeed himself as chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee, will be here
the week before the session opens with a
general plan of revenue reduction that
meets attack, more or less bitter, almost
before it is born. He will lind his most
strenuous opponents In his own commit
tee, among men from the West who be
lieve in keeping up the p; estÂ»ttt war taxes
until it is more accurately known what
the appropriations will be.
President Roosevelt's "publicity rem
edy" for the encroachments of trusts will
not be taken without a struggle.
Committee contests will be few, but
those that occur are likely to engender
more or less bitterness. The chairman
ship of the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations will be fought for by Senators
Cullom and Lodge. The place has not been
filled since the death of Senator Davis.
Senator Frye is the ranking member, but
he will be presiding officer of the upper
branch. Next in order to him comes Mr.
Cullom, and, according to precedent, he
would be selected as chairman, but Mr.
Lodge and his friends contest the selec
tion.
It has been widely reported that Presi
dent' Roosevelt was taking a hand in this
affair and urging Senator Lodge for the
place. The prerogatives of the Senate are
well known to be sacred. 'Any interfer
ence, even by so high an authority as the
Chief Executive, would be looked upon as
a serious breach of official etiquette. A
President may select a Collector for the
port of New York without consulting his
Secretary of the Treasury, but to take a
plunge into the private affairs of the
United States Senate, august and digni
fiedânever! So says tradition. But that
is just what persistent rumor says the
President is doing.
An intimate friend of President Roose
velt, and one who thoroughly knows the
Senate situation, denied absolutely to-day
that such was the case.
"There is absolutely nothing whatever
in such a story," he said. "I can deny it
emphatically and with authority. Senator
Lodge understands perfectly the situation,
and even if the President were inclined to
urge his selection for the chairmanship
he would not ask for it. But the President
is not so inclined."
Speaker Henderson has returned, look
ing strong and well and ready for the
work of the session. He will have no op
position for re-election to the Speaker
ship.
CULLOM TO BE CHAIRMAN.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â Senator Cul
lom of Illinois will he chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee of the Sen
ate, to succeed the late Senator Davis.
Senator Cullom to-day said:
"I cannot understand why rumors to
the effect that I was undecided whether
or not to take this chairmanship should
be put Into circulation. I have had no
other Intention since Mr. Frye declined
the honor."
Mr. Cullom's decls'.or to accept this
chairmanship will cause him to resign the
chairmanship of the Committee on Inter
state Commerce.
MESSAGE NEARLY BEADY.
NEW YORK. Nov. 17.-The World's
Washington correspondent sends the fol
lowing: President Roosevelt \s now put
ting his message to Congress into com
plete form. It is nearly ready for the
printer. It will contain from 14,000 to 16,
00 words. Terseness will be a character
istic feature, but there will be no specific
recommendation to Congress as to tariff
revision, although a reduction of Internal
revenue taxes may be advised.
The President will not commit himself
to an indorsement of pending reciprocity
treaties as examples of what should be
sought in the future.

COL.QN, Colombia, Nov. 17.â The Colom

In view of the unchanged conditions of

of subsidy legislation that will build up
the American merchant marine, specific
recommendation will be avoided. Atten
tion will be drawn to the very small per
centage of American shipments carried
in American bottoms. The President Is
of the opinion that all ships that are to
fly the American flag should be construct
ed with a view to being used by the Gov
ernment as auxiliaries in time of war.
The creation of a department of com

will be recommended.
A strong stand will be taken for the
restriction of foreign immigration. Re
enactment of the Geary law and contin

laws that will exclude anarchists seek

The President will urge the need of
legislation affecting trusts, but will not
submit any specific plans.
Considerable space will be devoted to
the army and the navy. The President,
in the case of the navy, will urge the
necessity of an increase, indorsing prac
tically the programme submitted by the
Navy Department.
He will earnestly recommend Nicaragua

the report of the Canal Commission.

Mississippi Moonshiners Murder Two
Deputy Marshals and Burn
Building to Hide
Crime.
OXFORD, Miss., Nov. 17.â John A.
Montgomery, Deputy United States Mar
shal pro tern. of this city, and Deputy
United States Marshal Hugh Montgomery
of Pontoloc, left here last night to ar
rest Will Mathls. an alleged counterfeiter
and moonshiner who lived twelve miles
east of this place. Early to-day Hugh
Montgomery's horse was found standing
at the gate of Curdy Hall, a neighbor of
Mathis, and Mathis' house had been
burned to the ground.
Upon further investigation two par
tially burned bodies were found in the
ashes of the burned building, which have
been identified as the remains of the
deupty marshals. John A. Montgomery's
horse has not been found, and it is sup
posed that Mathis made his escape- on
this horse after the morf had been killed
and the house set on flre.
Mathis' wife was at her father's, a few
miles fYom her burned home. She says
she and her husband left home yesterday,
her husband leaving the country.
Mathis was indicted last summer for
making and passing counterfeit money
and was out on a $2000 bond. The prin
cipal witness against him was a negro
living in the same neighborhood. About
a month ago the negro was assassinated.
The two Montgomerys went to arrest
Mathis for making illicit whisky and it
is supposed that they were prevailed upon
to remain for the night and were shot
while guarding their prisoner.
A posse of thirty or forty of the lead
ing citizens of Oxford went to the scene
to-day and every effort will be made to
capture Mathis.

IS PREPARING
ITS FINDINGS
Favor Accused Admiral
on Almost Every
Count.
No Substantiation of the Ac
cusations Hinting at
Cowardice.
May Conclude, However, That Schley
Disobeyed OTders of His Supe
riors in Going to Key WeÂ»t
to Coal.
Special DlÂ»patch to The Call
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â The find
ings of the naval board that conducted the
Schley investigation will be favorable to
the accused admiral on most of the points
involved. Those allegations which have
been proved to be unfounded, or of minor
importance even if substantiated, for the
reason that they involved simple questions
of judgment on the part of the command
ing officer, include the slow progress of
the squadron from Cienfuegoa toward
Santiago, the failure to destroy the Colon,
the effectiveness of the blockades at Cien
fuegos and Santiago and the "loop" of thÂ»
Brooklyn on the day of the battle. The
report of the naval board, which is now
in course of preparation, will sweep away
many of the allegations which were the
basis of the investigation.
The Schley court unquestionably realizes
that much of the matter before it is en
titled to little weight, but when it has
sifted out these things, it is believed, it
will find something left upon which ad
verse findings will be based. Though
much of the testimony regarding the sec
ond and third specifications, which con
cern the movement* of the flying squadron
off Cienfuegos and its progress toward
Santiago, must be disregarded as having
no bearing upon these points, one impor
tant point to be considered is Admiral
Schley's failure to communicate with tba
insurgents near Cienfuegos.
Deprived of Information.
After Schley's arrival off that port It
was reported to him that certain lights
were seen on shore at night, and every
witness who was asked about these lights
testified to having seen them. It is clear
that Admiral Schley did not know the
meaning of the signals, and no on* in
formed him.
The reason Admiral Schley has himself
assigned for the retrograde movement was
the short coal supply of the squadron and
the difficulty of coaling, but statistics of
the amounts the ships had do not, in the
opinion of close judges, reveal such a
state of affairs as should have alarmed a
resourceful commander.
It is believed In well Informed circle*
here that the court cannot fail to find that
the reports made by Admiral Schley in
regard to coal were incorrect; that the
retrograde movement was not justifiable
in view of his orders to blockade Santiago,
and that he c*ld disobey the department's
orders in continuing toward Key West
Instead of carrying out at once the In
structions as contained In the telegram
of May 25.
Controversy With Hodgson.
The only other specification on which
the court is thought likely to find against
Admiral Schley Is believed to be No. 10.
referring to his controversy with Lieu
tenant Commander Hodgson. The gist of
this affair, which has been much befogged
during the progress of the case, is that
Hodgson was interviewed in regard to a
colloquy said to have taken place between
Schley and Hodgson on board the Brook
lyn, and, the result of the interview hav
ing been published, Admiral Schley asked
Hodgson to write a letter denying that
such colloquy took place. Hodgson did 30,
but accompanied his letter with another,
in which he said that his denial was in
tended to apply only to the accuracy of
the words said to have been uttered dur
ing the colloquy, the substance of the pub
lished statement being correct. Admiral
Schley published the denial without the
letter of explanation. During the three
years following, in spite of Lieutenant
Commander Hodgson's efforts to lnducÂ»
Admiral Schley to publish the other letter.
or make a statement as to its contents, hÂ«
refused to do so. It is believed the court
will hold that this was not f^> treatment
of Hodgson by Admiral Schley.

BLANCHE PARTINGTON
IT v.-as EJi "en"' night with Puccini's
masterpiece "La Buheme" last night
At the Grand Opera-house, with a per
formance that struck sparks all
through after *be first dampness,
caused by the small Jiouse, wore away.
The audience was not like the one that
greeted Melba tnd the opera last year,
but it v/as mutical' to its tots, and soon
liiuniFiukaUy informeu the sensitives on
the other side of the footlights that the
house was with them anu theirs lor the
Eight- The applause was quick, generous
and sensitive, and the singers soon
showed their appreciation, of iis impulse
Ly outdoing thtmeeiv^s- In their parts.
Last Dicta's periorsuance iieid surprise
aÂ» well as delight. i_)o itarchi and Su
zanne Aaanis as Rudoilo ana Miini were
the particular astonishments of the cast,
and were responsible lor a large share of
the joy of the evening by their good
â¢work. De Marchi, v.liose Raoul of last
week Jell rather flat, last night won his
spurs â jingle of which noisily pre
ceded â *>.s Rudolfo- We have had a
Rudolf o of late that compares with' De
Jlarchi's in Agoetini up at the Tivoli,
though the voices are .essentially dis
similar. But there is iheipVsame earnest
ness, sympathy and lire in both concep
tions, though Agostiru"s was the more
even performance ol the two. But De
aiarehi shows great power, and his
voice, though lacking the smooth sweet
ness of Agostini'sâ which is not unlike
Cremonini's, v.ho sang the part last year
â has a depth, resonance ana breadth that
the Tivoli singer does not possess.
The Puccini opera evidently furnishes
exactly what De Marchi needs as inspira
tion, and when he found himself he made
things hum. He has a splendid power of
climax, though holding nimself common
ly too much in restraint, but when he
does let go something drops. It did last
night. The audience vociferously encored
his duet with Miml at the third acts
close, a very unusual proceeding on an
audience's part, and alter the last act. in
Â¦which there was the real thrill, cold shiv
ers and the whole paraphernalia, they
stayed to "Bravo!" over and over again.
X brave second in interest was Campa
:ari's brilliant Marccllo. the lovelorn ad
mirer of Musetta. Campanari is an ex
* ellent Ringer, an excellent actor, and last ;
right his broad, round voice and capable
dramatic art were at their most.
He acts better than De Marchi. Mar
cello is, of course, the finer acting part,
but he has never been heard here to bet
ter advantage than he was last night.
Gilibert was physically quite as uncon
vincing a starved Bohemian this year as
last as Schaunard, but did a satisfying
vocal and dramatic turn; Perillo de Segu
rola did not live up to his name as Col
line, and the famous "coat song" fell
somewhat flat. Dufriche did the double
parts of Benoit and Alcindoro with suf
ficient grasp.
And now Suzanne Adams, before known
here only as a lady of high degree with
colorature tendencies as - Rigoletta's
daughter in the Verdi opera. It would
seem as if we had not known Miss Ad
ams' capacities before, for Tier Mimi is
far beyond anything she has yet at
tempted in San Francisco. The part suits
her to a nicety. The simple naturalism
of the music gets her best vocal side and
there was pathos, magnetism and flexi
âcommonly what she most lacksâ
in the conception. She was in charming
voice and sang with finish, purity and
power. Not the least pleasure of the
part as done by Miss Adams is her physi
cal accord with the role. She looks Mimi
to admiration and 1 think it safe to say
that some day Miss Adams will be fa
mous in the role, for her promise yet
points the way to much higher perform
ance than anything she" has yet achieved.
But this seems her metier, and the au
dience gave very genuine pleasure in her
work.
â¢ Frltzi hefT indisposition caused the
engagement of Signorina Repetto last
night for Musette's part, and bravely the
little Tivoli singer held up her end of
things. Vocally the part is quite the
least satisfying thing Repetto does; nei
ther does she altogether satisfy in the
acting and I'm only sorry she should not
have been heard in something that would
have given better notion of her capabili
ties on this important occasion. But she
did wonderfully well, and her friends
gave her a rousing welcome.
It was Seppillis strong night, top, and
I have never before heard the orchestral
part go with such fine fervor and finish.
The whole thing was full of life and
sparkle, and. altogether, %be performance
was a memorable one. "To-night Sybil

TELLS THE DIVA
OF THE FUTURE
Emma Eames Consults
the Oracle in a Joss
House.
Mme. Emma Eames, by the grace of
Grau and her own divine voice one of
the rulers in the world of grand opera,
went forth last evening- In search of ex
periences. She encountered several, but
one in partieular%he will never forget.
During the week the diva had expressed
a desire to visit Chinatown. A visitor's
wish being law in California, Harry Hol
brook made arrangements for a tour of
the Oriental quarter, and last evening
Mme. Eames, with her companion, Miss
Fetridge, accompanied Mr. Holbrook and
a party of friends to Chinatown.
Under the pilotage of guides the diva
was shown the sights. The party was
about to start homeward, when some
body suggested a visit to one of the jose
houses.
They all filed in and breathed punk
laden air while the diva examined the
idols and commented upon the quality of
the Celestial incense. By and by Mme.
Eames found something more interesting
than either graven images or Oriental
odors. It was a little Chinese urchin.
The Diva and the Heathen Boy.
The diva and the juvenile heathen had
quite a little chat and were bowing their
good byes when young China's commer
cial instincts overcame his admiration
for the beautiful singer, and he said*
"You catch urn flortune?"
When it was explained that there was
a fortune teller within the sacred pre
cincts nothing would do but that Mme.
Eames should take a dip into the future
and learn by Chinese routes what the
gods held in store for her.
A weazened, shrivcled-up old man was"
brought forth. He was blUid and appar
ently unconscious of the presence of the
visitors. He took his seat on an ebony
stool and with much ceremony drew from
under his strangely embroidered cloak a
curiously carved jar. in which stood a lit
tle bundle of chop sticks.
i\ime. Eames faced the fortune teller
and listened to his strange incantations
intently. Presently one of the stick 3
arose from the jar apparently without
mechanical assistance.
"If 6 69," said the small boy, after

reading the inscription on the stick. A
solemn-faced priest then took a battered
chart from a sandalwood cabinet and af
ter studying it for some time translated
the prophecy as follows:
"You are going to be a noted singer.
You have already attained some fame, but
it is as nothing to what will be. Y<su have
now admirers in plenty. But in. a short
time you will have the whole world at
your feet. You have just recovered from
a serious Illness. You are done with sick
ness. Your life is for fame more glorious
than any dream."
Every member of the party is willing to
swear that there was no collusion between
them and the Chinese. The visit to the
josshouse had been unpremeditated, and
not even the guides knew the identity of
the famous singer. Of the diva's Illness
some months ago in Paris no one but Miss
Fetridge had any knowledge.
Madame Eames was very quiet and very
serious for the rest of the evening.
"Chinatown is interesting," she said,
"but your josshousesâ too spooky."
POWDERLY SAYS LAWS
SHOULD BE AMENDED
Would Distribute Alien Population
With Some Reference to Supply
and Demand.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â Commissioner
General Powderly of the Immigration
Bureau, in his annual report, reiterates
the views expressed in his last annual
report as to the necessity of amending
the laws in relation to the punishment
of persons who induce aliens to come to
the United States to engage in labor or
service of any kind. In discussing the
general subject of immigration, the Com
missioner General says in part:
To deal with the problem successfully It
seems indispensable to remove aa far as pos
sible those conditions which conflict with the
incorporation of the alien element Into the
social system of the country, so that by ac
tual experience the former may learn as soon
as possible that the basis and foundation of
American policy Ift a respect and affection for
and a willing obedience to the laws and cus
toms of the land, because the maintenance of
those laws Is the best safeguard of individual
liberty. It Is, therefore, recommended that
Congress enact suitable legislation either with.
or if necessary, without the co-operation of
the Btates, for the purpose of distributing the
alien population with some reference to the
industrial law of supply and demand.

TRIES TO KILL
MOTHER-IN-LAW
Sign Painter Fires Three
Shots at Mrs. Na
talie Nastori. *
G. Pracliacise, a sign painter, while suf
fering from an overindulgence In liquor
fired three shots at his mother-in-law,
Mrs. Natalid Nastori, last night, but failed
to injure her. The shooting occurred at
1324 Dupont street.
Some time ago Pradiacise eloped with
Mrs. Nastori's daughter, who was under
age. Learning that Mrs. Nastorl had
sworn to a complaint charging him with
abduction, Pradiacise induced the girl to
marry him. Since then, it is claimed, the
sign painter has been anxious for a
chance to get even with his mother-in
law for swearing to a warrant for his ar
rest.
Shortly after 8 o'clock last night Mrs.
Nastori and her 10-year-old daughter
Amelia went to visit a friend named Carlo
Damiana, who lives in the house where
the shooting occurred. While they were
conversing with Damiana. the enraged
sign painter burst into the room and,
drawing a revolver, fired three shots at
his mother-in-law. One of the bullets
pricked the skin over Mrs. Nastori's right
eye, while the other two passed harm
lessly over her head and lodged In the
wall. Immediately after firing the shots
Pradiacise ran from the place and went
to his own home at 530 Vallejo street.
Sergeant Christiansen followed him and
being unable to gain admittance broke
aown the door. Pradiacise was found hid
ing under a bed, and when ordered to
surrender threatened to shoot the officer.
After considerable trouble he was final
ly handcuffed and taken to the City Pris
on, where he was booked on a charge of
an assault to commit murder.
Mrs. Nastori is at a loss to understand
why her son-in-law should attempt to
murder her.
"I have always treated him kindly,"
she remarked. "As soon as I learned that
he had married my daughter I caused the
warrant which had been issued for his
arrest to be withdrawn. Recently I have
noticed that he acted coolly toward me,
but I never dreamed that he would try
to murder me. I am half inclined to be
lieve that liquor drove him to shoot at
me. Notwithstanding that he is my son
in-law, I intend to see that he is prose
cuted for his attempt on my life."
Pradiacise refused to make a statement,
except to say that he did not know why
he had attempted to murder his mother
in-law.
SOCIETY
STAYS AWAY
FROM OPERA
Music-Lovers Give tbe
Singers a Rousing
Reception.
THE performance of Puccini's
charming opera, "LÂ»a Boheme,"
given by the Grau company last
night, at popular prices, was a
source of keen delight to those
who were present at the Grand
â¢Dpera House.
Society was not there, but the audience
was composed of lovers of music, who
thoroughly enjoyed the musical fare of
fered to them. There were no waiting
carriages in front of the theater; gaily
flres3td women and somber-clad men were
conspicuous by their absence. Even the
Carpets were dispensed with on the side
walk.
What the audience lacked in numbers It
made up in enthusiasm. Dozens of men
and women could be seen in orchestra,
dress circle and the galleries, following
the music, score in hand. They, with the
balance of the audience, came to hear the
music and they were well rewarded. The
merits of the production and the reduced
prices should have drawn a crowded
house, but, as Manager. Grau himself has
Baid, grand opera in all countries is a "so
ciety function," so far as attendance is
concerned.
The boxes presented yawning chasms of
Bolitude, while the red plush of vacant
Beats stood out in bold relief all over the
theater.
It may be that society in this, as in
other large cities, is going through a pro
cess of incarnation in musical matters
nd that the next generation will witness
a season of grand opera when there will
be no "off nights."
Singers Enthusiastically Cheered.
Manager Grau put forth some of his
best singers last night to sing in "La Bo
heme," and judging by the manner in
which they responded to the plaudits of
the audience they perhaps enjoyed far
more the recognition of the average thea
ter-goers than they would that of an audi
â¢nce composed of the "Four Hundred."
Suzanne Adams. De Marchi, De Segu
rola, Gilibert, Dufriche, Vann and Cam
panari sang and acted the principal roles
of "La Boheme," and Italia Vittoria Re
petto, late of the Tivoli, took the place of
Frltzi Scheff. who was Indisposed. The
orchestra, under Seppilli's baton, came in
for a big share of recognition, and the en
tire performance was voted a complete
success.
To-night Gounod's "Romeo and Juliet"
will be given, with Sybil Sanderson,
Edouard de Reszke, Salignac, Bars, Bride
well, Journet, Bauermeister and Declery
In the principal roles. There is consider
able speculation as to what Miss Sander-
Son will achieve in the role of "Juliet."
To-morrow evening should be a gala
night, for Madames Earned and Sembrich
appear in "La Nozze di Figaro," with a
great cast, including Campanari as "Fig
aro."
Calve Appears on Wednesday.
Wednesday night should witness a gath
ering of society's votaries, for "the"
Calve is to appear as Carmen and show
San Franbisco the rendition of the role
that has thrilled all Europe and the east
ern cities of America.
"Die Meistersinger" Is to be given on
Thursday night, with Gadski. Schumann-
Heink, Dippel, Bispham, Blass, Muhl
mann, Viviarfi and De Reszke in the cast.
"Carmen" is to be repeated on Friday
night; "Lohengrin" is the bill for the Sat
urday matinee; Sembrich is to sing in "II
Barbiere di Siviglia" on Saturday night,
and "Les Huguenots" is to be sung on
next Sunday night at popular prices.
CHICAGO UNION'S
ENTER POLITICS
Intend to Form Munici
pal and State Or
ganizations.
CHICAGO, Nov. 17.â Inspired by the
success of the Union Labor candidates in
San Francisco and Bridgeport, Conn., the
labor men of Chicago are to be organized
Into a wage earners' party and will have
tnelr own candidate for municipal and
State officers. This movement was start
ed to-day by the Chicago Federation of
Labor. A meeting of all the labor men
of Chicago has been called for the first
Sunday in December, when a regular
party organization will be perfected.
According to present plans, the platform
will embody nothing but demands for the
enforcement of the claims of union labor.
The candidates will be wage earners and
all appeals will be to men of that class.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â 1n answer to
an inquiry from Commander Seaton
Schroeder, Governor of Guam, Secretary
Long has informed that officer that the
article of the naval regulations which
provides that the sentence of discharge
from the service with bad conduct dis
charge awarded by summary court-mar
tial to petty officers and persons of in

Two Weddings in Old Sonoma.
SONOMA, Nov. 17.â Two weddings were
solemnized here to-day. Miss Matilda

number of guests was present at the wed
ding and many handsome gifts were re
ceived. At St. Francis Church Miss K.

A DARUOTLOOK
FOR THE YOUNG MAN WITH
WEAK LUNGS.
Time and again we see young men
just arriving at their legal majority,
or having barely passed it. suddenly
stopped in a career full of promise.
Disease has laid its hand on the lungs !
He who never took a thought for him-
self must be careful now. He must be
careful about food and drink, careful
about his clothing and his exercise. No
more late hours or night air. No more
athletics. His lungs are "weak." He
has an ominous cough. He has fallen
awfty in flesh.
. When that cloud of consumption falls
on a young man's life it darkens every-
thing. The words of love die unspoken
on his lips. He cannot speak now to
the girl he hoped would share his future.
Middle aged men that have been under
that cloud remember it still with a
shiver. But the important fact is that
there are men who were once in danger
from "weak" lungs who have grown
strong again, married and brought up
healthy families.
HOW IT HAPPENED.
There is no chance about such cures.
If only a few persons had been benefited,
it might be said that they had exagger-
ated their danger or had only been suf-
fering from some common ailment. Bat
when the cured are numbered by thou-
sands ; when the doctor's diagnosis was
consumption ; when every symptom bors
out that diagnosis â weakness, emacia-
tion, bleeding of the lungs â and these
sufferers were perfectly and permanently
cured by the use of Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery, it must be concluded
that these cures are not of chance, but
due to the healing power of a great
remedy, for coughs, weak lungs, bron-
chitis, and like diseases, which if neg-
lected or unakillfully treated, find a fatal
termination in consumption.
Â¦ I beg to state that I have used three
bottles of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery since my correspondence with
you," writes Mr. A. F. Novotny, of New
York, N. Y. (Box 1437). Â«I feel that I
am in need of no more medical assist-
ance. When I started to take yonr medi-
cine I had a regular consumptive cough,
of which I was afraid, and everybody
cautioned and warned me concerning it.
I was losing weight rapidly, was very
pale and had no appetite whatever. Now
my condition is changed entirely. I
do not cough at all, have gained eight
pounds in weight, have recovered my
healthy color, and my appetite is enor-
mous. In conclusion I beg to state that
I ran and will recommend your mcdi-

GRATITUDE WILL OCT.
Gratitude, like murder, will out. Yon
can't stifle it. To that is due the tact
that there is so great a mass of testi-
mony to the remarkable cures effected
by "Golden Medical Discovery." It *â¢
testimony which no one can gainsay ;
testimony indisputable and unassailable.
It come* from people of all classes and
conditions, but in many cases from those
who have found a cure in the use of
" Discovery " when other medicines have
failed to help, and often when physicians
had pronounced the sufferer incurable.
Â«I took a severe cold which settled m
the bronchial tubes," writes Â».â¢?â¢ Frank
Hay, of Nortonville, Jefferson CÂ«., Xana.
"After trying medicines labeled 'Sure
Cure,' almost without number, I waa led
to try Dr. Pierce* Golden Medical Dis-
coverr. I took two bottles
and was cured, and have
stayed cured.
"When I tbitfk of the
great pain I had to endure,
and tne terrible cough I
had, it seem* almost
miracle that I waÂ» so soon
relieved. *
That God mar spare
you many years and abund-
antly bless you is the prayer
of yonr grateful friend."
There is one striking evi-
dence in almost all these
testimonials, both to the
actual diseased condition
and it* positive cure. That
evidence is found in the
loss of flesh, marking the
wasting character or the
disease, and in the gain of
flesh which marks the euro
by the use of "Golden Med-
ical Discovery w

Lumsden, Esq., of 221
Whitehall Street, Atlanta,
Ga. R At that time life
was a burden to me, and after spending
hundreds of dollars under numerous doc-
tors I was dying by inches. I weighed
only 131 pound*. In twenty days after
I commenced your treatment I was well
of both troubles, and in six months I
weighed 170 pounds and was in perfect
health. I have never felt the slightest
symptom of either since. Am now sixty-
five years old and in perfect health, and
weigh 160 pounds. No money could re-
pay you for what you did for me. I would
not return to tbe condition I was in, in
October, 1872, for Rockefeller's wealth.*

Death and Destruction in the
Wake of Storm on New
foundland Coast.
HALIFAX, N. 8., Nov. 17.â The terrible
gale that haa been raging on the New
foundland coast during the past three
days has carried death and destruction
in its track. Shipping has suffered se
verely as a result of the storm and many
lives have been lost.
A private dispatch which reached Louis
burg, C. 8.. to-nigrht states that the Nor
wegian steamer Ella, under charter to the
Black Diamond Lime Company, has been
lost on the Newfoundland coast in the vi
cinity of Belle Isle, with all hands. The
steamer left Montreal on Friday with a
general cargo for St. Johns, N. F.
The Ella was of 901 tons register and
was built at Sunderland in 189 S. This was
to be her last trip of the season on that
route. She carried a crew of about
twenty men.
ST. JOHNS. N. F., Nov. 17.â The bark

was wrecked yesterday morning in a
dense fog near Cape Race. One man,
Williams, lost his life in trying to reach
the shore. The captain and the rest of the
crew, all of whom were badly Injured, had
a terrible experience. They were on the
wreck for thirty-six hours, lashed to the
rigging, and were not rescued until tliis
afternoon. So thick was the fog that the
coast folk were not aware that a wreck
had occurred, the crew being unable to
make any signals that would attract at

GOMPERS SEEKS
TO AIR IGLESIAS
Cables to Porto Rico to
Have Bail Given for
His Release.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.-The release
of Santiago Iglesias, the agent of the
American Federation of Labor, who, on
arriving about a week ago at San Juan,
Porto Rico, to organize the workingmen
or" the island into trades unions, was ar
rested on a charge of conspiracy, prob
ably will be effected to-morrow. A ca
blegram was sent this afternoon giving
tna following authority to furnish bail:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â T0 Sidney McKee,
San Juan, Porto Rico: Request you to furnish
bail $500 for the release of Iglesias pending his
trial. The federation and myself will be re
sponsible. SAMUEL GOMPERS.
Another cablegram, sent to Iglesias in
jail, announced this action and requested
him to cable directly a report as to the
real causes of his arrest. Iglesias has not
cabled a word direct to the federation
since his arrest. The dispatches sent
from here to-day follow information re
ceived that Iglesias is still in jail and
that through the intervention of influen
tial friends the t>ail had been reduced
from $2000 to $500 and that McKee stood
ready to furnish the bail if the organiza
tion requested it and would be responsi
ble. Gompers also received private word
that as the incident had become a public
question it was deemed inadvisable for
any one on his own account in Porto Rico
to furnish the balL The executive council
of the federation, which Gompers did not
have time to consult in advance, doubt
less will approve of his action. Otherwise
he himself will have to stand for the
amount.
Gompers said to-day: "Neither the fed
eration nor myself will stand for any
thing unlawfully done by any one, but
Iglesias was arrested upon a charge
which can easily be proved to be without
any foundation in fact."

LONDON MARKET
STILL SLUGGISH
Northern Pacific Settle
ment Has a Depress
ing Effect.
LOXDOX, Nov. 17.â 1n ppite of the va
rious happenings follov.-ing which a rise in
Stock Exchange quotations was confi
dently predicted, the condition of affairs
at the end of the week has not materially
improved. Neither the Northern Pacific
nor the Franco-Turkish settlements, the
cheerful speeches of Lord Salisbury and
Mr. Brodrick nor the lack of serious news
from South Africa served to Impart the
promised upward movement on the ex
change
Up to the present time the cable ad
vices have failed to satisfy operators as to
exactly what the Northern Pacific settle
ment means and the published details had
a rather depressing effect. American se
curities closed the week decidedly off all
around.
President Roosevelt enters somewhat
iDto London's calculations. The rumora
of stringent anti-trust measures, which
would break up many of the existing
combinations, result in the President's
message being awaited here with the
keenest anxiety.
BERLIN, Nov. 17.â The redemption of
Northern Pacific stock by the Northern
Securities Company, and the iron report,
both American matters, were subjects of
foremost interest on the Boerse during
the last week.
In its financial article the Kreuz Zeit
ung says the influences of the New York
Stock Exchange continue to be very
strongly felt here. An advance in New
York quotations, this paper says, causes
a corresponding rise in Berlin the follow
ing day and Berlin obediently bulls the
market when New York realizes.
The redemption of Northern Pacific pre
ferred at par caused much disappointmenc
among German speculators, who expected
this redemption to be effected at 115. Gen
eral regret is expressed at the disappear
ance of Northern Pacific preferred from
the German market, as this stock has al
ways been one of the most active securi
ties on the Berlin and Frankfort Boerses.
Tne Frankforter Zeitung, speaking of
Iron, says:
"The danger of American competition
in the German iron market is rapidly
growing. Of course, the American de
mand Is at present so strong that imports
from the United States are impossible,
but the time is probably not distant when
the United States will throw her product,
not only on the markets of the world, but
will also begin competition In Germany.''
Irons were strong yesterday because of
the American reports which caused the
Bhorts to cover. Rises during the past
week In iron averaged 19 points. The Co
logne Yolks Zeitung says the Siegen fur
naces have reduced the price of puddling
Iron from 90 to 60 marks per ton.

AIRSHIPS FOR THOSE
WHO HAVE THE PRICE
Two Thousand Dollars Will Buy a Flying
Machine in the Open Market.
BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Nov. 17. â For a retail price of
$2000 a flying machine will be placed on the market
within the next half year if the plans of Gustave
Whitehead of this city carry. Mr. Whitehead says
that he has had his enterprise financed and is confident of
success. He now has fifteen machinists at work.
Six months ago Whitehead, whose name is anglicized
from Wilskopf, made his first test of a machine, the prin
ciples of which are embodied in a model which he will sell to
any one who cares to buy. Whitehead will not reveal the
name^bf the man who is supplying the money, but he has
been seen about the plant frequently and is said to be a
resident of New York. The machine is operated by steam
and immense wings and a propeller moves it through the
air. It has an automobile attachment, which is used to raise
it from the ground.
Whitehead says that when he first conceived the idea of
a flying machine he noticed that birds run a few feet on the
ground to gain headway before soaring and he put in the
autombile for that reason. He is confident that his apparatus
can make forty-five miles an hour' and says that he ha-s al
ready traveled at that rate of speed in his old model. The
machine, the inventor says, will carry six persons.
STRIKERS AND GUARDS
IN BATTLE AT A MINE
MADISON VILLE, Ky., Nov. 17.â Mining
troubles in this district brought more
bloodshed to-day. James H. Smith, a ne
gro striker, is dead; George Crouch, an
other striker, is fatally wounded, and
John West, Hut Dawson and Nathan
Bush, all guards, are wounded, but none
of them dangerously.
The trouble occurred at the mines of the
Providence Coal Company, seventeen
miles from here, where an attack began at
4:30 o'clock. The attacking party, sev
enty-five or eighty strong, first fired on
the engine house, and then in a few min
utes the company's stables were sur
rounded. A horse and mule were killed
and several other animals disabled.
By this time the guards were becoming
active and the attackers formed in a
semi-circle over the brow of the hill.
From there they poured a well-directed
lire upon the houses occupied by the non
union employes and their families. Men,
aroused by the crash of bullets, rushed to
small timber piles arranged for use In
such an emergency, and from behind
these returned the fire. The attacking
party, while sending volley after volley
into this quarter, kept up a steady fire on
the tipple, engine room, stable and other
buildings of the company, while the
guards for their part were doing effective
work.
The battle raged for almost an hour and
a half, when the assailants withdrew,
leaving Smith dead and Crouch wounded
on the field. How many wounded they
took with them is not known, but the
leader was seen to fall and it is believed
some of the party who went to his rescue
were hit.
County Judge Hall, at Providence,
started an investigation. An inquest was
held, the Coroner's jury's verdict being
that the negro came to his death at the
hands of the guards while the latter were
defending life and property and they were
therefore justified. Adjutant-General
Murray at once commenced an investiga
tion, opening communication with the
Governor.
Following the battle at Providence mine
there were riots at other Kentucky mines.
An attack was made on the nine guards
at the Monarch mine, three miles from
Earlington. to-night, but it was repulsed.
Two employes of the St. Bernard Coal
Company, at Bernar-Is Gap, were fired
upon by a man who sprang" from behind
a tree. There was much trouble at other
places, but neither injury nor loss of life
resulted.
Owing to the day's riots and the serious
situation in the mining field of Webster
and Hopkins counties the Governor has
ordered out two companies of State
troops. The MadisonvMle company is do
ing patrol duty in the outskirts of town,
and the Hopkinsville company of the
Kentucky State Guard reached here at 11
o'clock to-night.
Adjutant General Murray issued a state
ment to-night, in which he declares he is
determined that Inwlessnep? shall be sup
pressed. A detail of twenty men has
started for the Providence mine.
To-night as the train having the troops
TWO MEN DEAD,
ANOTHER DYING
Bank Robber and Victim
Succumb to Their
Wounds.
SIOUX CITY, lowa, Nov. 17.â John
Sundblad, who was shot in the battle with
the Greenville bank robbers at Albert
City, lowa, died to-day. Constable Lo
dine is in a critical condition.
The robber, who was shot in the stom
ach, also died to-day, after doggedly re
fusing to give his name or the address of
his friends. Before he died he admitted
that they robbed the bank at Greenville.
Sheriff Harker. took the negro and the
white man to Storm Lake last night. They
also admitted the crime and gave the
names of Jack Johns and Louis Brooks.
Besides $435 in money recovered from the
burglars, they confess to having secreted
$500 in a cornfield six miles from Albert
City, on the farm where they were cap
tured. A searching party to-day failed to
recover the missing money.
The Grand Jury will meet to-morrow at
Storm Lake, and an effort will be made to
indict the captured robbers for murder in
the first degree.
Sundblad made an ante-mortem state
ment that the negro fired the fatal shots.
Lodine also says he was shot by the ne
gro.
The station at Albert City showa marks
of the fight between the citizens and ban
dits yesterday. After the shooting sixty
seven empty shells were found on the sta
tion floor, which had been emptied by the
robbers while firing into the posse.
The robber who died was shot by Mike
Conlin, a farmer living west of "Albert
City, at a distance of forty rods, with a
45-caliber repeating rifle. Conlin took
refuge behind a pile of boulders.
The Sheriff has three revolvers, two
burglar saws, a bottle of nitro-glycerine
and a large number of cartridges that
were found on the robbers. The negro and
one white man carried razors.
Law-Breaking Indians Pined.
CHEYENNE. Wyo., Nov. 17.â Sheriff
Miller of Newcastle and hia posse have
returned from the Big Thunder country,
northwest of Newcastle, where they cap
tured nine Shoshone and Arapahoe Indiana
who were slaughtering wild game. The,
Indians have been tried ana found guilty
They were fined $10 to $250 each and are
now selling their horses to raise the
amounts. For several years roving bands
of Indians have violated the State game
laws in this section, but the marauders
always escaped from the officers.

At the Madisonvillc camp the strikers

With the other nine customers we say for their protection : Money back if they want it â

This is a safe store, first, last and always â safe for the man who can judge clothes â
safe for the other nine who must depend solely upon what we say.

FIRE PREVENTS
SEARCH OF MINE
Water Seems to Have
But Little Effect on
Burning Shaft.
Trains Are Rushing Hose to
Scene of the Terrible
Disaster.
BLUE FIELD, W. Va.. Nov. 17.â Up to
this time no other bodies have been
recovered from the Pocahontas mine dis
aster, but several may be added to the
list, which now numbers nine, as there are
two or three miners unaccounted for. The
mine is still burning fiercely and for the
past twenty-four hours very little haa
been accomplished in the way of search
ing the mine for those that are still miss
ing. It was supposed last night that the
fire would have been under control by this
afternoon, but it was found this morning
that a large amount of hose and pipe was
yet needed in order to reacn tne lire. This
morning the wholesale nardware estab
lishments or this piace were caned on for
all their pipe and hose available and pas
senger trains were held here for the pur
pose of rushing this material to the scene
of the disaster. The mine officials are
sparing neither effort nor expense in car
ing for the injured, burying the dead and
extinguishing the flames.
Two excursion trains carried over 2000
people from the coal fields of Focahontas.
Fiat Tip and Elkhorn to the scene Of the
Baby mine disaster to-day, and all day
long the grounds about tne entrance to
the mine shaft were a mass of humanity.
The work of those who were engaged in
recovering the bodies was somewhat re
tarded by the crowds. Officials had to
stand with clubs at the entrance to pre
vent curiosity seekers from entering, but
even then a few forced an entrance
through the air passages.
The three bodies taken out yesterday
were badly burned. They are supposed to
be Hungarians and were interred this af
ternoon. The amount of money necessary
for relief is being raised by popular sub
scription.

HOMESTEAD, Pa., Nov. 17.â One- man
was killed and two seriously burned as
the result of a party of workmen being
buried under a mass of molten slag at
the Howard Axle Works to-day.
The dead:

The injured: Andrew Hulsi. aged 33,
Homestead; leg fractured, body badly
burned; George Siskl, aged 50, Homestead,
bad scalp wounds, severe burns all over
body.
The accident occurred on the cinder
dump back of the company's plant. The
victims were engaged in collecting scrap
when a party of workmen at the top of
the dump, about twenty feet above,
dumped their car over the edge, not
knowing that the men were directly be
neath them. The car contained about
eight tons of slag, a great part of which
was red hot and much of it in a molten
state.

TRADE REPORTS CHEERFUL.
ACCORDING to the country's bank clear
ings, which arc accepted as the best barom
eter of trade, there was a slight falling
<_!t in business last week. There was a gain
of 9 per cent over the corresponding week
last year, but the weekly gain has for months been
so much larger than this that the inference is natural
that the vo/SBtt of commerce during the week was
beiott the weekly average for the past several years.
At the same time the usual commercial reports from
the different sections indicated no decrease, and were
cheerful in tone, with illustrations of more than nor
mal activity in several parts of the country.
As far as the staple* are concerned, business is ap
parently as good as at any time during the year. The
shipments of boots and shoes were 19 per cent larger
than last year, while the demand for goods is so brisk
that the usual between-seasons shut-down will be
omitted this year. Hides and leather continue firm,
with no signs of any accumulation of stocks. Gen
eral merchandise is reported in heavy demand almost
everywhere, and the holiday retail trade is expected
lo beat all previous records. Most manufacturing lines
report so many orders on hand that even should no
fresh business be received the mills will be kept busy
tar into the new year. The woolen mills report
spring orders coming in liberally, and some lines of
woolen clothing are actually scarce. There is no
halt visible in the iron and steel industry, the demand
for pig iron being so keen that a premium is being
paid for immediate delivery, while the leading steel
rail interest reports its whole output for 190.2 already
booked. Cotton has hesitated more or less for sev
eral months, the weather in the South having been
against the crop. In the Southwest the scarcity of
corn and oats is being felt, and the upper tier of
States is being drawn on for supplies at higher prices
than rule at Chicago, while large quantities of wheat
are being fed to stock in lieu of the grains usually
employed for this purpose. Last summer's drought
was not exaggerated at the time, as is now seen, and
even at this late day the winter wheat needs more
rain before hard freezing sets in. while some parts of
Kansas and Missouri are rushing their livestock into
market on account of the scarcity of water supplies.
It was thought during the drought that the de
creased yield of farm produce throughout the West
and Southwest would materially cut down the earnings
,of the railroads: but expectations in this direction
have happily not been realized, as the earnings in Oc
tober were 11.3 per cent greater than in October,
1900. while the scarcity of cars, about which the whole
country is complaining, is seriously hampering the
movement of all kinds of farm produce and merchan
dise. Wheat has been unsettled during the past week,
and the market has shaded off slightly; but increased
speculation at Chicago is reported, due largely to
general confidence in thf future of the market. Pro
visions are still reported more or less weak, and all
cured meats have declined one-half cent per pound.
Business in Wall street has been very fair, and in
the middle of the week there was a decline in both
railroads and industrials, though it was followed by
an immediate partial recovery.
The local situation stands the same. Frequently
tecurring showers are keeping the new grass grow
ing and enabling the farmers to plow in many parts
of the State. The trade of this port is all that could
be desired, both for State and export account. Money
continues plentiful and easy, and there are signs of
more activity in real estate, both city and country
Prosperity is still with us.

PROBLEMS FOR CONGRESS.
AS the time for the assembling of Congress ap-*
proaches reports from Washington concerning
its probable action during the session become
more and more contradictory and confused. It is not
strange that it should be so. The old issues upon which
the parties have fought in recent elections Ijave been
settled. Free silver is no longer a live question, and
consequently the political leaders will have to align
themselves this winter upon new questions. Repub
licans, of course, have only to stand firm upon the
ground now occupied, but the Democratic leaders
will try to shift the contest to some point where they
may at least hope for an advantage, and consequently.
a large part of the debates of the session will be taken
up with partisan skirmishing for position.
It is gratifying that the isthmian canal question
and that of the re-enactment of a Chinese exclusion
law are not partisan issues. It is possible that eacli
of these much desired measures may be providefl dur
ing the session without much trouble. The opposi
tion to the isthmian canal, however, is still formida
ble, and the people will remember that many a ses
sion in the past has opened with every prospect for
the passage of a canal bill, but has been brought to
a close without anything more being done than the
appointment of another commission. The interests
antagonistic to the canal are strong, and, notwith
standing no political party avowedly supports those
interests, they have still a considerable following in
both houses and in both parties, and we cannot be
sure of the beginning of the enterprise until the bill
providing for it has been duly enacted and is signed
by the President.
The partisan interest in the session will center
round the efforts made to bring about some kind of
tariff revision, or to provide for an extensive system
of reciprocity treaties. Ample evidence is before the
country that the Democratic leaders are quite willing
to renew their attack upon the protective system, and
will do what they can during the session to furnish
their party with a policy upon which to appeal to the
people in the coming Congressional elections.
The skirmishing on these questions is going to bÂ«
the more interesting because several Republicans
have declared themselves in favor of tariff revision
and of the reciprocity treaties now before the coun
try. It remains to be seen how strong that element
is and whether any considerable number of Repub
licans will vote against their party on either of the
two issues. It is, of course, not likely that the de
fection will be great, but if there be any at all it will
encourage the free traders and the Democrats to
make a tariff fight next fall and the party issue of the
immediate future will be practically determined.
Along with the tariff issue will be that of the enact
ment of an adequate measure for the promotion of
our merchant marine. The Republican party has
not yet fulfilled its pledges to the people on that sub
ject. The shipping bill should have been enacted as
promptly as the protective tariff bill, and every de
velopment of trade and industry under the protective
.system has demonstrated anew the need of giving
governmental support to our merchant marine. Our
foreign commerce is now almost wholly in the hands
of foreign shipowners and as a consequence we pay
to the foreigner a heavy tribute upon our own trade
â a tribute that increases as the trade increases.
The partisan skirmishing on these and kindred ques
tions will be the more keen because the increasing
surplus in the treasury proves that the revenues of the
country are larger than are needed at the present rate
of expenditure. There are some who favor the under
taking of internal impro%-ements on an extended
?cale. so as to bring the expenditures up to the in
come and thus provide for a prompt return of the
money in the treasury to the channels of trade.
Others would cut down the income by reducing" in
ternal taxes. Still others would reduce the customs
on foreign imports. It is to these questions Congress
will have to address itself, and around them party
leaders will skirmish for position. It is going to be
an interesting session.
The English railway officials who have come to
this country to study American railway methods are
said to have been astonished by what they have seen,
and the report is not surprising, for there are sonic
things in American railway methods that astonish the
natives.
LACK OF EXERCISE.
SINCE the physicians and surgeons who at
tended President McKinley reported that the
fatal result of his wound was due largely to
conditions brought about by lack of exercise, there
has been a good deal of study given to the habits of
high officials at Washington, and the general conclu
sion is that very few of them take anything "like the
> amount of exercise reeded for the preservation of
health. The average American official is a man of
simple but severe dignity. The British statesman,
even when a member of the Ministry, does not hesi
tate to ptay golf or cricket, ride a bicycle or spend
weeks on the moors shooting; but the American, ex
cept in rare instances, dares not do anything of that
kind. He seems to regard anything less than official
work as beneath his dignity, and consequently he
breaks do An when he should be 'full of vigor and
health.
There is. moreover, another feature of Washington
life that is perhaps even worse than the lack of exer
cise. It is the unhcalthful condition in which the offices
are maintained during the winter. One authority says
that as soon as the weather justifies any fires at all,
the public buildings are kept intolerably hot. Even
the corridors of the great department buildings are
fairly stifling and the offices are like ovens. Men
who work in such overheated rooms for eight hours
a day almost inevitably losoi vitality, become bilious,
dyspeptic and tired out. Living in that kind of atmos
phere, taking no exercise and working hard, the pub
lic official exhausts himself and breaks down when
ever any severe and unusual strain is put upon him.
Grover Cleveland, who was one of the hardest
working Presidents we ever had, was wise enough to
take' holidays at frequent intervals and to spend them
not in idling round a farm or a watering place but in
fishing or duck shooting. Thus, despite his corpu
lence, he managed to maintain his strength and
health and is still a vigorous man. President Roose
velt has always taken plenty of time for exercise and
will doubtless continue to do so. Thus Washington
officials have good models to follow if they choose
and have the energy.
It is probable the climate of Washington has much
to do with the habits of the Government officials. In
i summer it is too hot for out-of-door exercise and in
j winter the damp, cold weather almost forces the of
| ficials to keep their offices overheated. If they lived
I in San Francisco they would live differently and be
healthier. In our climate not only is almost every
day in the year suitable for out-of-door exercise, but
most days are so fine and the air so bracing with
brisk breezes that they fairly tempt men to get out
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1901.
from their offices and recreate themselves by some
kind of exercise. Should the time ever come when
we feel it necessary to assure the health of our high
officials, it will be worth while to move the capital
from the Atlantic Coast to that of the Pacific and set
it up in this city.
President Roosevelt has declared himself opposed
to the use of political or social influence in getting
promotions in the army or the navy, and it is to be
hoped he can make his opposition strong enough to
put an end to the practice.
OUT of the tidal wave of Republican successes
which swept the country and submerged
Democracy in the late elections two Demo
crats bob up serenely, smiling to their friends and
assuring the public that everything with them is
lovely and prospects are bright. Those two men are
David Bennett Hill of New York and Tom L. John
son of Ohio.;
Kill's happiness was such that immediately after
the election he went to New York City and showed
himself smiling conspicuously, above the wrecked
remnants of Tammany Hall. He was hot at all
averse to expressing his gratification over the fall of
Croker. He "is reported to have said two days after
the election: "It goes without saying that I am
greatly gratified with the result of Tuesday's elec
tion. My fight always has been for a pure Democ
racy which represents government for the people and
by the 'people. It is only a question of time when
Tammany will work out its own ruin. This election
is only the beginning of the end for Tammany Hall.
There is no room in the United States for an organi
zation founded on pure personalism. The result of
Tammany's defeat on the Democratic party through
out the nation is bound to be good. The people are
good judges, and they may be relied upon in the
end."
The satisfaction of Hill is hardly more than that
which comes from the attainment of personal re
venge. Croker turned him down at the Kansas City
convention and threatened to drive him out of the
Democratic party. Hill has his innings now. It
seems certain that Croker will be forced out of poli
tics, and his rival will remain to be an important fac
tor in the Democratic camp for many a year to come.
With that quarrel the general public will feel little
or no concern. Croker was never a national states
man, and Hill can no longer aspire to be one. It is
different with Tom L. Johnson of Ohio. That en
terprising gentleman sees a brilliant career ahead of
him. He expects to be re-elected Mayor of Cleve
land, then Governor of Ohio, and then President of
the United States. His dream is bright enough to
interest the nation.
Johnson claims that he is the only Democrat who
achieved any success at the polls or received any kind
of indorsement from the people at the elections.
Quincy was beaten in Massachusetts, Croker in New
York and Bryan in Nebraska. Moreover, Mr. John
son notes that the Democratic candidates for State
onices were beaten in Ohio, while his local ticket was
successful in Cuyahoga Count}'. He regards that as
a proof that the McLean Democrats in Ohio are as
weak as the Bryan Democrats proved to be in
Nebraska. Taking that view of the situation, Mr.
Johnson is unable to perceive above the horizon any
Democrat but himself, and naturajly he rejoices
in his boom and feels sure of the future.
As no other prominent Democrat can see things
from exactly the same standpoint as Mayor John
son, it is not to be expected they will agree with him
as to the importance of the position he now occupies.
None the less, the appearance of Johnson as a can
didate for the Democratic nomination for the Presi
dency is an interesting fact. He is a lively man, is
Tom, and he hails from Kentucky, so Colonel Wat
terson will have to be watchful or his aspirations for
the nomination will be defeated by a man from his
own home.
RUSSIA is advancing in more ways than one.
She is doing something more than construct
Siberian railroads and Baltic canals. In
spite of the condemnation pronounced against Tol
stoy by church and by state, and in spite of the in
evitable conservative reaction produced by the crimes
of anarchy, the public mind of Russia is becoming
more tolerant and more liberal. Recent reports from
Europe reveal the fact that Russians of official posi
tion now feel themselves free to say many things and
to advocate many policies in public which a com
paratively few years ago they would hardly have ven
tured to whisper among their most intimate friends.
One of the most notable instances of the change
that has come over the Russian people is to be found
in the report recently given of the address made by
M. A. Staknovich. marshal of the nobility of the
province of Oral, to the missionary congress of the
province. In his address he is said to have argued
frankly for a repeal of many of the restrictive laws
now in force, and to have declared that orthodoxy is
so well established among the people that the church
and the Government might well afford to leave every
one free hereafter to choose what religion seems best
to him. Furthermore, the story goes he denounced
the policy of making people orthodox by force, and
declared that the present practice of trying to whip
religion into a man is as futile as it is barbaric and
cruel.
It is true the speech roused the wrath of a good
many of the orthodox leaders of the missionary
congress and created so much of a sensation that it
was communicated to St. Petersburg, from which
place the reports of it were sent to Western Europe
and to this country. Such results of the address were
of course to be expected. They do not, however,
weaken the significance of a speech made to such an
audience by such a man and under such circum
stances. Here, at any rate, is a clear case of the ut
terance .of liberal sentiments in the face of an an
tagonistic audience, and it undeniably proves that
liberalism in Russia has taken courage and dares to
assert itself.
There is truth in the old saying, "One swallow
does not make a spring," and so we are not. to expect
that one free utterance of a plea for religious liberty
will make Russia free. When one swallow appears,
however, there is very likely to be another ere long,
and the example of Staknovich may rouse others to
emulate it. Freedom of religion would be a
boon to Russia in many ways. It would go
far toward checking the tendency of the people
toward anarchy and atheism, for those things are
more often the offspring of tyranny than of liberty.
It may be safely said the Russian church gained
nothing by the excommunication of Tolstoy, while
it would gain immensely by putting itself on the side
of liberality and enlightenment.
Ruhlin feels sore, of course, but not so sore as those
who bet on him
HILL AND JOHNSON.
NEW LIGHT IN RUSSIA.
SPANISH ADMIRALS MAKE PROTEST
AGAINST HAMPERING OF THE NAVY
BATTLEHIP ALABAMA THAT SUFFERED SERIOUS INJURY BY THE PREMATURE EXPLOSION OF A
SHELL RECENTLY DURING TARGET PRACTICE. THE BIG GUNS. THE MAIN SUPERSTRUCTURE AND
MAIN BATTERIES WERE DAMAGED, NECESSITATING EXTENSIVE REPAIRS TO THE VESSEL.
THE Spanish admirals are in revolt against the Govern
ment and sent the senior officer, Admiral Valcarel, to
seek an audience with the Queen Regent. This he
easily obtained and laid before her the grievances of his
comrades. They object to the civil control over naval aftalrs
and credits, declaring that officers of the navy are not guided
by political motives, but solely by the dignity of their profes
sion. They want the Government and Parliament to say, once
for all, if a navy is wanted, and in that case to provide for
its necessities. If not wanted the officers and others belonging
to the present navy should be dismissed. Madrid newspapers
comment severely on this incident and declare that discipline
in the navy is undermined. The general public has shown a
decided hostility toward the navy since its fiasco in the recent
Â¦war with the United States, evidently ignoring the fact that
official corruption and incompetence were largely responsible
for its defeat. The letters of Admiral Cervera and ether offi
cers showed that the navy .was unprepared for any service
whatever; that the fighting personnel realized this fact and did
its very best under the most adverse circumstances.
The Normand Sigaudy water-tube boiler comes to the front
with a record better than that of any boiler of that type. Cap
tain Carballo of the Spanish cruiser Rio de Ja Plata reports
that' during a commission of fifteen months the vessel steamed
24,000 miles, consuming 3500 tons of coal, and that the tubes are
still in good condition, none of them being chocked or having
suffered in any way. The stokers were not a picked crew, but
of the average found in the Spanish navy. The tubes of the
boilers are only 30 milimeters in diameterâ not quite one and
one-fifth inches. The San Rafael and San Gabriel, two small
cruisers; are also provided with these boliers, which are giv
ing satisfactory results. The Rio de la Plata is a sheathed
cruiser of I*oo tons, built In France in 1898. In the absence of
data relating to speeds maintained and other varying condi
tions extending over the period, during which 24,000 miles were
steamed, no idea can be formed of the economic quality of the
boilers, but the fact that they are in good condition after hav
ing been in use for so long a time and that none of the tubes
have suffered, and consequently need no renewal, is a great
point in their favor.

The navy pf Greece is said to be in a wretched condition.
Prince George has made a speech, in which he declared that
the naval arsenal is in a state of confusion and that the ships
are simply rotting owing to neglect. He ascribed this condition
of affairs as due to politics and declared that it was idle to
dream of any reform until the supreme command of the navy
was rendered immune from all political influence and inter
ference. The only remedy would be to place it under the im
mediate direction of a prince of the reigning house.

Dorado County. There is still there a ho
tel or stopping place, a saloon and gro
cery store and quite a little settlement,
with a fine school system, known as the
Tennessee school district. Up to eight

Springs, but since the postal authorities
have changed it to Rescue postoffice. The

pian mouth of the Volga, but as there la no necessity for such
protection it is surmised that the flotilla will become a part of
the navy to be used in the event of further troubles which,
have recently developed In that locality.

Real Glass Houses.
How would you like to live in a glass |
house? â¢
Jules Henrivaux, one of the greatest
French chemists, considers glass the
most serviceable, available and sanitary
material for building houses.
He has executed a model building made
of glass held together by angle Iron.
There are pipes for hot and cold water,
electric wires, sewerage, everything need
ed for the comfort of a householder.
Staircases, ceilings, wall decorations,
fire placesâ all are of glass*.
The decorations aro remarkable both
for beauty of design and color. They
are made of opaque glas?. arranged in
prisms and crystals, with facets like dia
monds.
Chairs and tables are of vitrified glass,
and the residence and its furniture are
Indestructible.
The entire surface of everything, from
top 3tory to basement, can be washed
clean with soap and water and dried in
ten minutes. There is no dust and no
cobwebs.
The walls of the house arc colored and
entirely Impenetrable to light except
through window and doer openings.
M. Henrivaux is an enthusiast on glass.
He points out that there is an inexhaus
tible supply of material for making glass.
It can be manufactured out of sand.
It never wears out.
It can be molded into any shape.
It is easily made non-breakable.
Paris has already begun to pave her
streets with glass.
Glass is also made Into dresses, pipes,
baskets, and is now being substituted
for many pieces of Iron machinery.

FOOTPADS KEEP
POLICE MOVING
Robberies Reported in
Different Parts of
the City.
William Ryan the Victim of
a Bold Attack en the
Water Front
Robbers continue to keep the police
busy. Al. McClair of Seattle and Ben
Meyers of Mexico engaged a room Satur
day night at the lodging house, 6M Sacra
mento street. About 5 o'clock yesterday
morning three men entered their room
and one pointed a revolver at them and
commanded them to keep their heads un
der the bed ciothes on pain of being shot.
The burglars searched the pockets of
their clothes and then the man with the
revolver asked Meyers for the key of a
trunk that wus in the room. Meyers told
him the trunk did not belong to eitner of
them. "You're a liar," retorted the rob
ber, and he struck Meyers twice over the
head with the butt end ot the revolver.
Meyers begged him not to murder him as
he was teuing him the truth and he de
sisted.
The trio then left, taking with them a
suit of clotnes, coat and vest and $3 in
coin. The matter was reported to Police
man Lake, but neither McClalr nor Mey
ers could give an accurate description of
the three men.
Dentist Made to Disgorge.
Charles Morgan, a sailor, was found in
an unconscious condition at Battery and
Jackson streets shortly after 10 o'clock
Saturday night and was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital. He was roused suffi
ciently to say that he had been robbed of
ihe last thing he remembered was
being in a saloon at California and Du
pont streets, where it is supposed he had
been drugged. His trousers pockets had
been cut out and his purse, which he
kept in his stocking, was found to bs
empty. Captain Seymour has detailed De
tectives McMahon and Riordan on the
case.
Frank Miller, a sailor, who resides at
the White House, 414 Jackson street, was
brutally beaten by footpads on Battery
street, between Pacific and Jackson,
shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday morning.
At the time Miller was going to hte lodg
ings in an intoxicated condition. The rob
bers secured $2 from him.
Dr. McPike, a dentist at 2525 California
street, reported to the police yesterday
that he was held up by a footpad In the
park at Pierce and Post streets shortly
after Â» o'clock Saturday night. He was
with Miss Annie Warren of 2503 Clay
street at the time.
Robbed in Daytime.
The young lady had taken a seat on a
a bench in the park for a moment as
something in her shoe was hurting her
foot and the footpad came up to Dr. Mc-
Pike with a revolver In his hand and de
manded his money. He got $2 and the
dentist induced him not to take his
watch, as it was a keepsake and not
worth much money. Dr. McPike was able
to give a good description of the footpad
to Detective Coleman, who was detailed
on the case by Captain Seymour yester
day.
One of the boldest robberies ever com
mitted on the front took place yesterday
morning. William Ryan was knocked
down by two men on the corner of Jack
son and Battery streets and his pockets
were rifled.
About 11 a. m. yesterday Ryan was on
Jackson street and heading for his room.
The two footpads crossed the street,
knocked him senseless and then robbed
him of $4 20. The act was witnessed by
Clarence Carett and William Cummings,
who, after helping the injured man to his
feet, followed the robbers. They saw them
enter the restaurant and Carett went to
look for a policeman, while Cummings
remained on watch. When Carett got back
with Officer Flynn the men were gone,
but a search along Davis street resulted
in the arrest of a young fellow Â¦who gave
the name of Jesse Smith. He was charged
at the Harbor prison with robbery, he
being identified by Carett and Cummings.
The other man escaped.

The Orpheum Presents a Bill
Full of Inte Training
Features.
Haverly's Minstrels opened before i
crowded house at the California Theater
last night and the show presented by th*
black faced artists was deserving of
every bit -of the hearty applause which
greeted each number. Being a minstrel j
performance, the audience looked for ,
nothing new, and consequently were not !
disappointed when it saw the same old
lirst part with its galaxy of tambos and
bones. It is a combination of clever
people. They all sing well and the old
George "Wilson tells his stories in his us- j
ual inimitable manner and sings as well I
as ever. George Morgan, the 'taale so- !
prano, possesses a wonderful voice, and
Mozier and Conley, the singing and talk
ing comedians, do a turn that is laugha
ble in the extreme. Marion and Pearl do
a very tunny turn in a clever manner,
tneir tumbling itiiig especially good, and
Garden and aoineis are great musical
artists.

Never before in this city has there been
such a troupe ol cycle naers as the Kauf
manns, who made their rirst appearance
at the Orpheum yesteuay. There are six
in the familyâ a girl three boys, a man
and a woman â ana they ride around the
stage, which seems decidedly small, by
the way, in pairs ana trios, and finally
the hall-dozen are wheeling about in soud |
formation. Cross-legged, siue saddle and |
through the frame, they all work the j
same iricks at once, and do them well,
'men the stage is given over to one of the I
boys. The youngster has absolute com
mand of his wheel, and a triple piroutte
is performed without loss of balance. He
strips the front of his frame while riding I
the rear wheel, and resumes the same be
fore striking the stage, and he rides three
high on one wheel and keeps on riding
until he get 6 ready to come down. There
is no perceptible lack of steadiness when j
he is carrying the two on his back, and i
both in single riding and team work the |
troupe are wonders. A somersault over
a table is an extraordinary feat, and the
finish is when the six ride on one ma
chine at the same time.
Bicknell. a modeler of comic and his
torical heads in clay, kept the house in
laughter for twenty minutes. He has
been heralded as "tnc most successful
mud-slinger on earth," and he lives up to
his title. Buffalo Bill, an American In
dian, a German, an irishman and his
mother-in-law were fashioned in short
order, and while the last named was be
ing slapped together ir.e orchestra played
"Because I Love You," and when Bick
nell fired additional clay at tier, saying,
"That's what I'm poing to give her
Christmas,' the musical accompaniment
was "You'll Get All That Is Coming to
You."
Ward and Curran present a humorous
hodge-podge entitled "Familiar Charac
ters," during which Mr. Curran sings sev
eral ballads and impersonates an Italian
arrested for maltreating his wife and a
stuttering cab driver. Mr. Ward enacts
the role of a San Francisco Police Judge
and an eccentric old *naid. Lillian Burk
hart, the indefatigab'e worker, presented
for the fourth week of her successful en
gagement Edmund Day's clever playlet
"A Deal on Change," in which she scored
such a hit last year. The present pro
duction is better than the former one, and
Miss Burkhart Is ably supported by Os
car Norfleet. Fred Niblo. the American
monolopist, had a complete new routine
of stories, in which he was happier, if
possible, than last wetk.
"The Girl With the Auburn Hair"

SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 17.âThirty
seven years ago at the battle of Columbia,
Term., Henry Sprague, now of Spokane,
was shot with an old Springfield rifle, the
ball entering on the right side of the

inquired the cause of the scar. A little
examination and the bullet was located.
When extracted it weighed exactly one
ounce. The wound is healing rapidly and
Sprague will return to his family in a few
days. He says he had never experienced
pain from the wound since It healed up

MEADE DEPARTS
FOR THE ORIENT
Trouble of the Engineers
Settled to Suit Those
on Board.
The United States transport Meade
sailed yesterday morning at 6 o'clock, the
trouble in the engineer's department hav
ing been adjusted to the satisfaction of
the engine room crew. The adjustment
enabled the vessel to get away and means
peace for the present voyage, but the
Marine Engineers' Association will prob
ably take a hand in effecting a permanent
understanding in the case of other trans
ports.
The action of those of the Meade's en
gineers who resigned their positions rath
er than proceed on the voyage short
handed is heartily indorsed by members
of the association, and while the organ
ization has so far declined to take any
official cognizance of the trouble there is
a strong feeling of disapproval at the
action of the men who replaced the re
signing officers.
'The transport service is particularly
hard on the engineers' department," said
one member of the association yesterday,
"and cutting down the engine room crew
is not only unfair to the engineer officers,
but is inviting unnecessary danger and
imperiling the safety of valuable Govern
ment property. It Is necessary to main
tain steam on transports from the time
they leave here until their return. This
makes it difficult and in some cases al
most impossible to attend to necessary
overhauling of the boilers and other parts.
With a full complement every precaution
necessary for safety can be taken, but
short-handed a great deal must be left
to luck. . .
"A Government transport, he con
tinued, "engaged in tropical waters should
have an even larger crew in the engine
room than would be necessary on a
steamship engaged on a regular commer
cial run The Government will soon see
the folly of attempting economy in this
direction. The matter will be fully ex
plained by the association to the proper
authorities, and I do not believe there
will be much more heard of reducing en
gine room crews on United States trans-
The Marine Engineers Association is
probably the most conservative organiza
tion of its kind in the world. It has the
respect of the shipping community and is
not likely to do anything which will in
any way hamper the Government. The
association is not through with the Meade
affair however, and before the next
transport sails there will be a definite un
derstanding between the Government and
the association as to the amount of as
sistance required In transport engine
There is no blame attached to Captain
Matthews, the superintending engineer
of the transport service at this port. In
reducing the crew of the Meade he was
simply following orders from Washington.
He understands the situation as well as
any member of the Marine Engineers' As
sociation, and will probably be an import
ant factor in restoring the old order of
affairs.
Boy Caught With Plunder.
Three boys were seen by Policeman
Braig acting in a suspicious manner on
Powell street, between Geary and Post,
about 4 o'clock yesterday morning. They
scattered and Braig succeeded in captur
ing one of them, who gave the name of
Ed Viner and his residence at 2SI Ivy ave
nue. When searched fourteen packages
of cigarettes and tobacco and a new pipe
were found in his pockets. He said he got
them from the other boys, whose names
he said were John Johnson and Ed Mc-
Farlane. He was locked up in^the "tanks"
pending an investigation.

LOCATE DEBTORS
TRHOUGH MAILS
Scheme Is Worked by
Bill Collectors in
This City.
A shrewd scheme Is being worked
through the United States mails by some
of the bill collectors in the ity. With the
approach of the holiday season it ia not
unusual for persons to be notified by ex
press companies that prepaid packages
are awaiting them at their offices and
the receivers of the information have
visions of presents from old Santa Claus.
Hundreds of postal cards are being
mailed by an "express company" that
exists only in the minds of its promoters.
The postal card sent to the last known
address tells the recipient that a prepaid
package awaits him at the office and will
he "kindly fill out the return half of the
postal card giving his correct address."
Uncle Sam delivers the postal to a new
address when known.
The bait is a tempting one and Is swal
lowed. The "express company" has all
replies sent to a post office box at the
main postoffice, and the location of the
"company" is of course' unknown.
Persons who take the bait, instead of
receiving a package of "goodies" are
furnishing their correct addresses for bill
collectors, who use the above means to
secure the desired information.
The persistent bill collector will then
haunt the abode or office of the debtor,
who wonders how hia creditors found out
his new address.
The postofflce . authorities state that
there is no way to stop the use of the
mailÃ by the bill collectors in the manner
indicated. They have carefully gone over
the proposition, but the postal laws are
not broad enough to prevent Uncle Sam's
postofflce service being utilized for the
purpose named.

DRUIDIC ORDER
GAINS MEMBERS
Monster Initiation Is
Held in Odd Fel
lows' Hall.
Two Hundred Strangers Are
Inducted Into the
Mysteries.
Yesterday was a red-letter day In the j
history of Druidisna in San, Francisco, for I
in Odd Fellows' Hall nearly 200 strangers j
were initiated into the mysteries of the |
order in the presence of many of the grand i
officers and nearly 1000 Druids from the j
various groves of this city and those i
across the bay. The groves that had the j
greatest number of candidates initiated
were Manzanita, with 78; Perseverance.
36; Hesperian, 17; McKinley. 11; Galileo, 7,
and the other groves furnished from two
to five each.
The main hall had been arranged in the j
form of a grove and on either side of the j
hall chairs were set out in sections for \
the candidates of each grove. The stage
was occupied by Noble Grand Arch Ju
lius S. Godeau. Past' Supreme Arch L. G.
Schord, Past Noble Arches L. F. Dunand
and George H. Bahrs, Grand Secretary
James F. Martinoni, Grand Treasurer F.
J. Horn, Grand Marshal George Beck,
Grand Trustees A. M. Armstrong, Charles :
de Leigh and members of the executive
committee.
After a few Introductory remarks by the
chairman of the executive committee, an
English-speaking team from Golden Star
Grove, in appropriate costume and each
member wearing a long white beard, giv
ing him the appearance of a venerable !
Druid of olden time, was presented. This |
team, a comparatively new one. did its
work in a very satisfactory manner, giv
ing the ovate' s degree to all but those
who had placed their membership in Per
severance, the French grove. The team i
did some pretty floorwork, particularly La '
the formation of the initials of the gen- |
eral password. The charges were well de- ;
livered and the members of the team were
loudly applauded.
Then followed the French team, which
In many respects was the equal of the i
other, and in dramatic effect it surpassed !
it. The judges of the competition found I
Â¦ that each team had outclassed the other I
in certain parts of the work, and that,
taken as a whole, each had done equally
well, so they recommended that each be
awarded a prize of equal value.
After the initiation Noble Grand Arch
Godeau delivered an address of welcome
to the newly initiated members. Past N-j- \
ble Grand Arch Bahrs talked to the new
members upon their duty to the order
they had Joined and Past Noble Grand
Arch Dunand gave their index to enable I
them to study the history of Druidism, :
so they can more fully appreciate the les- I
sons taught in the ritualistic work. He
closed with an eloquent address on the
beneficial work, in which the order is en
gaged in this State.
The chairman, after thanking all who
contributed to the success of the grand
initiation, heard those present sing
"America," after which the meeting was
adjourned with three cheers for the noble
grand arch.
IDENTITY OF SUSPECTED
TRAIN-ROBBER IN DOUBT
Wyoming Officials Feel Certain That
He Is Butch Cassidy, a Noto
rious Desperado.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Nov. 17.â Local of
ficers wno have had much to do with
the "Hole in the Wall" and "Robbers'
Roost" gangs of outlaws in this State
during' the past five years, and who are
acquainted with every member, say they
are almost certain that the man under
arrest in St. Louis for attempting to pass
bank bills taken by the men who robbed
the Great Northern train at Wagner,
Mont., in July last is no other than Harry
Longbaugh. Old residents of the State
who have known Longbaugh since he was
a boy, say the description of the prisoner
answers that of L" gbaugh. United States
Marshal F. A. Hadsell knows Longbaugh
well and feels certain he would be able
to identify him. Ex-Warden McDonald,
of the State penitentiary, says he believes
the prisoner is Butch Cassidy, the noted
train and bank robber who served a num
ber of years in the Wyoming penitentiary.

WHEELMEN WHIRL OVER THE FAMOUS SAN LEANDRO TRIANGLE COURSE
DOWNING RIDES
A FAST RACE
Wins Time Prize in Ten-
Mile Event at San
Leandro.
Agraz of San Jose Is First
From a Handicap
Mark.
Burton Downing, the slashing big rider
of the Garden City wheelmen, made the
fastest time yesterday in the eighth an
nual ten-mile handicap road race of the
California Associated Cyclists. He rode
the ten miles over ordinary roads in
twenty-five minutes and twelve seconds.
His brother, Lace Downing, followed him
over thÂ« tape, thtir wheels lapping one
another. Less than a wheels length
away were A. McDonald, als*o of the
Garden City Wheelmen, and Fred West,
of the Bay City Wheelmen. All these
riders started from the "scratch " mark.
The actual winner of the race turned
up in E. AgTaz, of the Garden City
"Wheelmen, who was allowed one minute
and thirty seconds start. With him in
the last rush to the tape were H. L.
Kewsom of the Bay City Wheelmen, M.
Gray and C. Limberg of the Oarden City
Wheelmen. They linished in a bunch.
Following: them came a group of nine
riders, whom the officials could not place,
as they crossed the tape in a compact
mass. After all the other positions had
been allotted the names of these nine
were placed in a hat and drawn one lit
a time and were then given places in the
official table.
There were a number of minor acci
dents and one severe one. W. D. Stod
dard collided with a dog near the finish
and was thrown heavily. He did not re
gain consciousness for some time. A doc
tor said he sustained a slight concussion
of the brain.
I. R. Lind, a veteran of many road
races, was among the prizewinners, se
curing fifth place.
Of the forty-two starters, thirty-three
finished. J. J. Borree fell soon after the
start, disabling his wheel. Williams, Phil
lips, Mitchell and McXulty were in col
lision with a buggy which was being
driven on the wrong side of the road on
the base of the triangle. All fell, but got
off lightly in the matter of bruises.
Bergman sustained a punctured tire.
Williamson fell, as did Ballister. The
following is the official table of the race:

After the road race the riders and spec
tators repaired to Elmhurst track, where
some races were held. The principal
event was a five-mile paced race between
Burton Downing and Al Kr.ox. Downing
hiid just made fastest time in the road
race but it seemed to take none of the
speed out of him. as he defeated Knox
handily. They started from opposite sides
of the track. Knox's tandem pacemakers
took him along too fast in the early part
of the race, practically running him off
his legs. He nearly overhauled Downing
in the first mile but then dropped back,
Downing winning by a lap. Hardy Down
ing, who has just returned from a suc
cessful season on the Eastern circuit,
directed the pacing of his promising
brother. The time for ten miles was
10:37?4.
As though this was not enough for one
day Downing won the mile handicap from
â¢cratch in 2:48.
This is the last racing on Elmhurst
track, as it is to be torn down at once.
The track was originally built in the
V-Jeflrome near Golden Gate Park and
â¢was the scene of some of the most ex
citing racing ever held on the coast. It
Â¦"as <*ut into sections and removed across
the bay to Elmhurst.

MAY HEMPSTEAD
WINS THE FINAL
Beats Some Fast Dogs
for Honors in Open
Stake.
Narcissus Defeats Ireland in
Special Event at Union
Coursing Park.
The running off of the two stakes of
fered the Union Coursing Park patrons as
the regular weekly attraction resulted in
as line sport as has been seen on the big
field in many months.
The hares were a surprisingly lively lot
and set such a clip for their pursuers that
in almost every instance a decision was
arrived at only after a heavy score had
been rolled up.
The day's feature was the magnificent
exhibition of coursing shown by Joe Hol
ton's performer, May Hernpstead, In the
open stake. That she was considered an
outsider in the going was evinced by the
fact that in the long odfis book she was
posted at 11U tol. One ticket was recorded
at that price just before she went to the
slips for her hrst course.
The trial was an easy one, the speedy
little courser allowing her opponent, Laay
Passage, to score but one point against
her thirteen. After beating Fly by Night
and Greenhall in turn and witn points to
spare, the fast traveler seemed to run
herself to a condition that put her on
edge, as in her next three courses she
showed such speed and determination that
not a single point was credited to the
scores of the hounds she met.
Not alone did Holton's entry win au
easy stake, but to her credit must be
added the breaking of two park records.
With 882 seconds of coursing before the
final she upset a long standing time mark
and a total score of ninety-four gives her
two points above her own heretofore un
equaled tally.
In the final she went to the slips with
King Cotton. A selected hare was liber
ated for the pair and it started a fast
pace from the slips. May led King Cot
ton and nearing the hare turned it in
front of the grand stand and back again.
Not once did King Cotton get close
enough to assist.
Time for relief was near at hand and
as the hare ran by the slippers" stand
Jim Grace grabbed for the hare, picked it
up, and throwing it over the fence ended
the one-sided course.
In the special stake Narcissus won a
grand final from Ireland. Geary's hound
took a lead of two lengths and scored the
lirst six points. Narcissus got possession
and with Ireland working in a mixup, the
score stood 22-10. Narcissus fell and Ire
land got in for 5. Narcissus recovered
and in a strong dash scored the kill.
A. R. Curtis' Fetter Free-Echo young
ster made a great showing in her course
with Hukon Dick. She had the speed but
lost through inexperience.
The day's results, with Judge John
Grace's official scores, follow:

son, Richard Erskine and Grant Smith.
In the preliminary round Gibson al

SWINDELLS IS ENGAGED TO COACH
THE STANFORD BASEBALL TEAM
THIS IS THE MAN WHOM THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF STAN
FORD UNIVERSITY HAS CHOSEN TO COACH NEXT YEAR'S BASEBALL TEAM. HIS MIDDLE NAME IS
A MISNOMER, AS MAY BE SEEN BY A GLANCE AT HIS RECORD.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov.
17. â The executive committee of the
Associated Students has empow
ered Treasurer Harry Edwards to
enter Into an agreement with
Charles Jay Swindells, former varsity
catcher, with the object of securing his
services as coach for the 1902 varsity nine.
While Treasurer Edwards has not made
a definite agreement with Swindells, there
seems no doubt that the latter will coach
the nine. Dr. Murphy, last year's coach,
is practicing his profession in New York,
NEWS OF THE OCEAN AND BAY.
It has been blowirg hard along the
coast for more than a week, and in con
sequence every vessel arriving has had a
tale of woe to tell. Among them was the
Columbia River steamship George W.
Elder. She got in yesterday morning
early, twelve hours iate, and Captain
Randall says it was one of the hardest
voyages he ever made. One big sea that
broke aboard threw Chief Officer Wallace
against the lee rail, and when he was car
ried to his room it was found that his leg
was broken.
The Elder left Portland three days ago,
with thirty-two cabin and forty steerage
passengers. After a short stop at Astoria
she went out over the bar and at once
ran into the gale. For hours she barely
held her own, but C; ; rLain Randall kept
her at it, and she finally got out of the
storm center off the Columbia River.
From that on the run was a fair one.
Among the vessels that were to have
sailed Saturday were the steamship Car
lisle City and the shir John A. Briggs.
Neither of them went to sea on account
of the storm, but when fair weather came
yesterday both went to sea. The Briggs
is bound for Melbourne, Australia, with
a cargo of lumber, while the Carlisle City
goes to England via St. Vincent with a
cargo of. wheat. The latter formerly ran
in the Santa Fe line to the Orient, but
her charter has expired, bo she goes home
for an overhauling.
TKTLL VISIT THE GALLAPAGOS.
Party Is to Sail on Mary Sachs for
Islands.
The schooner Mary Sachs Is to sail for
Clipperton Island and the Gallapagos to
day. Among those who will go away on
her will be Major John Burns, Professor
Beck and some assistants. Major Burns
goes to Clipperton in the interest of the
Pacific Islands Company, which holds the
concession to the guano deposits on Clip
perton. A number of men have been there
since last year, and they will be taken off
and landed at Acapulco. From Clipperton
the Mary Sachs will proceed to the Gal
lapagos, where she will remain until Pro
fessor Beck has finished his researches.
He is after rare birds and reptiles for
some English people, and at the same
time will make a collection of shells for
the Smithsonian Institution.
Alameda a Success.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda, into which new engines and boilers
were recntly placed, made a splendid run
to Honolulu on the last voyage. She aver
aged more than fifteen knotn for tne run,
and when "opened out" each day for a
four-hour spin made 36.5 knots an hour.
Leaving San Francisco in the morning,
she made 304 knots for her first day's run.
Thereafter her showing was 356, 344, 356,
358 and 354 nautical miles for each day.
On her run home the Alameda Is expect
ed to beat this showing.

Eagan and Reitz Carry Off
Honor 3in a Clever
Contest.
The immense crowJ which thronged
Recreation Park yesterday afternoon was
treated to one of the prettiest contests of
the season. The jrame.was replete with
all the incidents and maneuvers that go
to make the great national game good to
look upon. The score wag cose, the ball
was hit hard and often and at times it
was anybody's ganu-. It was a superb
day for a ball game, which accounts for
the large crowd. The "fans" favored the
men from Oakland, and every time a crip
ple distinguished himself he was given a
hand from the stands und bleachers. Both
Pitchers were hit hard, but Muskiman
was fortunate in keeping his well scat
tered, while in one inning the Dudes went
arter Aiirock in so rapid a manner that
mey made enough runs to win.
Dougherty opened Hostilities for the An
geis with a tracKlne two-bagger to the
center-fleld fence. Aiherton new to Dun
leavy, and on Francks' error of Keiizs
drive Dougherty sprinted home, while
ijeitz landed on the s/.cond cushion. Tne
Angels scored again in the third. Dougn
erty hit sate but was out stealing second.
Atherton got to second on Monler's er
ror, went 10 third on Heitz's out to first
and scored on Kihm's arlve out to center
field. Kihm stole second, but was nabbed
at the plate in attempting to score on
Hall's single.
The Cripples went alter the "southpaw"
with a vengeance in the fourth. Francks
singled, stole second and made the bell
ring on Dunleavy' 3 double. Dunleavy
completed his trip on Eagan's swat to
right, and "Truck " went one further on
Dougherty's error. Al this juncture old
Pete Lohman rolle i out a triple and
broug-hf Eagan and jJabbitt in. But for
Hall' 3 accurate trrow Pete would have
made the fourth station on an ordinary
three-bagger, which v.ould have estab
lished a record.
The red legybunched five hits in the
sixth and seventh, which resulted in two
more tallies. In the mlantime the Dudes
fell onto Altrock for tnree in the seventh,
which made the score :ead Oakland 5* Los
Angeles 4, and so it stood until the end.
Pete Lohman'c presence in the game
seemed to inspire his men with confidence.
Pete has not been playing lately, but he
did splendid work yesterday and was in
strumental in winning: the game. "Truck"
Eagan had his batting eye with him, hit
ting out three two-cushion swipes and
one single. Reitz played second base as
no other man in the league could have
done. His work was a revelation, as he
accepted eleven hard chances without the
slightest semblance cf an error, and
blocked two hits which might have been
doubles. Umpire Levy made a couple of
bad decisions at second, and gave Dr.
Moskiman the worst of it on balls and
strikes. The score:

Artillery Companies Shoot.
Companies A, B. C and D of the First
Battalion, National Guard of California,
held their regular annual skirmish shoot
yesterday at the Presidio range. With
the exception of Company C the shoot
was not well attended â in fact, two com
panies did not have the required 80 per
cent of their members present. Company
C not only had over the required per
cent In attendance, but succeeded in scor
ing 1151 points, the highest average se
cured by any company in the State dur
ing the present year. The score is so far
above the general average that it is
thought it will entitle Company C to the
trophyâ a beautiful silk flagâ awarded by
the State.
The targets used vere silhouettes in
kneeling, prostrate and erect positions.
The soldiers fired from the 500. 400, 300,
250 and 200 yard marks. They commenced
the fusilade at the 500-yard mark and ad
vanced down the line. The weather was
ideal for marksmanship, which probably
accounts for Company C's fine showing.
Shooting at San Rafael.
SAX RAFAEL, Nov. 17.â There was a

WOMEN OCCUPY
CHURCH PULPITS
Fort Worth Temperance
Workers Discuss Re
ligious Topics.
Secure Pledges to Maintain
a Missionary in the
Philippines.
FORT WORTH, Tex., Nov. 17.-To-day
presented the great religious feature of
the Women's Christian Temperance Un
ion. Thirty-four women occupied as many
pulpits in different churches in this city,
preaching in most instances morning and
evening. The topics covered were the
whole common ground of religious
thought of the world. Doctrinal discourse
was tabooed. Methodists occupied Pres
byterian pulpits, Unitarians talked to a
Methodist Episcopal South congregation
and Baptists and Congregationalists fra
ternized under the white banner of tem
perance. Some of the most prominent
pulpit orators were Mrs. Mary HÂ«nt of
Boston, Mrs. Margaret D. Ellis of Wash
ington. DC; Rev. Eugenic St. John of
Kansas, Mrs. Clara Parrish Wright of
Illinois, Mrs. Mabel L. Conklin, national
lecturer and organizer. New York; Mrs.
Addle N. Fields, world's missionary to
Mexico; Mrs. Marion Dunham of Burling
ton, Iowa; Mrs. Howard Hoge of Virginia,
Miss Belle Kearney of Mississippi and
Miss Christene Tenllng of London, Eng
land.
All these speakers preached to apprecia
tive and overflowing congregations.
The chief interest centered in the an
nual sermon preached in the Christian
Tabernacle by Elizabeth W. Greenwood
of New York, world's and national evan
gelistic superintendent on "Preaching the
Gospel."
She said: "Politicians strove to make
Theodore Roosevelt Vice President that
they mirht remove him as Governor of
New York, in the hope that they would
no longer be hindered in their wicked
schemes, and behold! a most signal and
disastrous reversal of their plans. Roose
velt, a man of destiny, becomes Presi
dent, while his successor, Governor Odell,
develops ability to rise above the alms
and standards of the machine politicians.
History emphasizes the exactness of
God's justice."
This afternoon a grand Philippine rally
was held at the opera-nouse, which was
overflowed. The question of evangeliz
ing the islands was discussed in the light
of the personal relation of one who had
been there and pledges secured to main
tain a missionary for a year.
TWO BROTHERS
IN HOT FIGHT
Prominent Horsemen En
gage in a Street En
counter.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 isroadway, Nov. 17.
A quarrel over racetrack affairs led to
a hot street fight this afternoon between
W. P. Magrane, a prominent Kentucky
horseman, who has a string of horses at
Emeryville, and his bi other, J. G. Ma
grane, a well-known bookmaker, who
"cut in" at tho track this season.
The battle occurred at the corner of
Twelfth and Clay streets, opposite the
Young Men's Christian Association build
ing and the First Congregational Church.
The fight was at its best just as Police
man Mackey, riding tp the jail in the pa
trol wagon, hove in sijrht. The spectacle
of two well dressed men sending straight
lefts, uppercuts and swings at each other
with very evident haimful intent caused
the patrolman to halt .n his journey, turn
the "black maria" into the curbing and
quickly jump between the quarreling pair.
The Magranes were induced to cease
fighting, and the policeman managed to
pull them out of a hard clinch, land the
pair In the wagon and resume his Journey
to the calaboose, wnere the two were
charged with battery. As they stood in
the reception-room for prisoners Book
maker Magrane appeared the worse for
the encounter. A bie; lump on the back
of his head evidenced where he had hit
the hard stone sidewilk after one of his
brother's heavy leads.
"If I had had a pisto! I would have
killed you," said Bookmaker Magrane to
Horseman Magrane during the ride to the
City Hall. But further violent demon
stration was checked by a warning from
the policeman.
Both men had been drinking consider
ably, and their quarrel Is supposed to
have resulted largely from this. They
refused to talk about the fight, and after
depositing $25 bail eich were released,
with orders to appear :n court to-morrow
morning. The police are satisfied the
quarrel will have been settled before that
time.
Horseman Magranc is the owner of
Nellie Forrest, The Singer and other
racers now at Emeryville. Both of these
horses landed purses un November 12.

by Citizens.
WELLINGTON. Kan., NÂ«v. 17.âSafe
blowers raided Milan, a small town six
teen miles west of here, at an early hour
this morning, and after entering every
prominent store, wrecked the safe and
fixtures of the Milan State bank with
dynamite. Two doors were blown off the
safe, but the third, on which was the
timp lock, resisted the force of the ex
plosives and the citizens, who had been
aroused by the noise, rushed into the
Ftreets with shotguns and drove the rob
bers away before they had -secured any
plunder. Bloodhounds from Wichita were
taken to Milan, but they refused to take
the scent and the pursuit of the men was
abandoned.

ANDERSON JURY
FINALLY AGREES
Renders Verdict Finding
the Denver Attorney
Not Guilty.
Third Trial of Sensational
Case That Attracted
Great Attention.
DENVER, Nov. 17.â The Jury in the An
derson case this afternoon brought in a
verdict of acquittal, thus ending one of
the most interesting criminal cases ever
tried In the courts of Colorado.
W. W. Anderson, a lawyer of this city,
shot H. H. Tammen and P. J. Bonfils, pro
prietors of the Denver Post, about a year
and a half ago. The shooting occurred
in the private offices of the owners of the
paper and for a time It was thought Bon
fiis would not recover from his wounds.
He survived them, however. Tammen
only received slight wounds in the affray.
Anderson was tried three times, the first
two trials resulting in divided juries. The
trial just closed was merely a formal
presentation of the recorded evidence
given in the previous trials and argument
of counsel, the idea being to have a new
jury sit in the case. The trial was con
cluded Saturday and the verdict rendered
as above stated to-day.
It was due to sworn statements made,
by jurors in the second trial that Messrs.
Bonfils and Tammen, Police Magistrate
Thomas and others were tried for at
tempted bribery, and acquitted recently.
The Grand Jury is now conducting an In
vestigation of the bribery charges.
FRUGAL FLYNN
FINDS FRIENDS
Aged Wanderer's Past Is
Uncovered to Police
Guardians.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 17.
With nearly $9000 to his credit in sav
ings banks of San Francisco aged Peter
Flynn, the mysterious wanderer, was a
popular guest to-day at the City Prison,
where he has been cared for since the
police found him yesterday aimlessly
meandering about the streets. A score of
people called to identify the old man, and
out of the many visitors came scraps of
his past history that partially solved the
mystery that had surrounded the decrepit
old pioneer, for such he proved to be.
It was thirty years ago when railroad
ing was young in the West that Peter
Flynn, a hearty, healthy man of 40 odd,
established a hotel at Flynns Station,
near Winnemucca, Nev., where he played
host with such success that he accumu
lated quite a pile of gold. He was care
ful and provident, sending his savings to
San Francisco, where they grew into a
neat nestegg. After a while the hotel life
wearied him, and Flynn came to San
Francisco with a competency sufficient to
keep him during the remainder of his
days.
Flynn had few relatives and with them
he had little if any intercourse. Publicity
given to his detention here disclosed the
fact that Mrs. Honora Graham, residing
at 1123 Sutter street. San Francisco, is
his cousin. Mrs. Graham was among the
numerous visitors at the jail to-day. She
said her cousin had hitherto declined to
have anything to do with her.
"It isn't his money I want," she de
clared tearfully. "But I would like to
take care of him in his old age. He needs
some one to look out for him."
The police agreed with Mrs. Graham,
but they decided not to release their aged
ward until his condition had improved.
He is In an enfeebled state mentally, but
since yesterday had brightened consider
ably.
Officers from the German Savings and
Loan Society inspected Flynn's books to
day and found that he had more than
$8000 to his credit. He lived so frugally
that since last April he had drawn only
?135, and of this amount a portion had
been sent to Nellie Flynn of Charlestown,
Mass., another cousin.
The old man had occunied a room at
W. P. Whitmore's, 565 Eleventh street, for
a day or two. Here he kept his few per
sonal belongings, a valise full of odds and
ends of clothing. With this he had been
for years drifting from place to place, as
his fancy suited him.
Captain of Police Wilson, under direc
tion of Chief of Police Hodgkins, has
taken temporary charge of the old man.
He will probably be persuaded to become
an inmate of some institution where
proper attention can be given him.

THIEF TAKES
COSTLY GEMS
A New York Merchant
Loses a Fortune in
Diamonds.
Ten Thousand Dollars the
Value of the Precious
Stones.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Nov. 17.â Diamonds valued
at $10,000 and about 5200 in money were
stolen to-night from a room in the Port
land Hotel occupied by E. F. LOwenthal
of New York City and the audacious'
thief managed to escape with his booty
and get safely away.
Lowenthal is a dealer in precious stones
and he is at present on the Pacific Coast
on a business trip. Last Saturday nignt
he arrived at the Portland Hotel and was
assigned to a room on the ground floor
facing Yamhill street. His traveling trunk,
containing the greater part of his dia
monds he used in trade, and a portion of
his money were placed In his room.
There are two keys to this room, one
used by the guest and placed in the office
when it is not in use, and the other usual
ly kept by the janitor In charge of all the
rooms 'on that corridor.
To-night after dinner Lowenthal went
out, leaving his personal key in safe keep
ing. Between i) ana 10 o'clock he returned
and went to his room, intending to retire
for the night, and he was horrified to find
his trunk broken open and the most ex
pensive of his diamonds and about $200 in
money missing.
In considerable agitation he ran to com
municate with Manager Bowers, saying:
"I've been robbed oi my diamonds."
"Surely not, ' said Bowers in dismay,
and he too peered at the broken trunk,
that told an eloqaent story of robbery.
The police were sent for and Detectives
Day and Weiner arrived. No marks were
found showing that the lock of the door
had been forced, : and it was then assumed
that the thief had opened the door by
using the janitor's key. which was in his
coat hanging in a room in the basement.
The janitor was off duty last night, and
he usually makes a practice of leaving
the keys in the coat he wears when on
duty. This working coat dangled from
its accustomed peg in one of the em
ployes' rooms in the basement.
The detective went downstairs and
found in the passageway leading to a
back yard several pieces of the trays
which had contained the diamonds. The
thief had first placed the precious stones
In his pockets and had then torn the
trays to pieces. A teil tale ladder placed
against the wall facing on Seventh street
showed that the thief had escapeu that
way, evidently preferring not to run the
risk of capture by leaving the hotel by
any of the main entrances.
The police at once worked out the var
ious clews that suefested themselves and
policemen and detectives went to work
around the terminal depot, paying especial
attention to those people leaving on de
parting trains.
KNIFE ENDS
THE QUARREL
Yuba City Resident Is
Slashed by Fellow
Townsman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARYSVILLE, Nov. 17.â T. P. CoateÂ«,
a well-known resident of Yuba City, lies
in a precarious condition at his home in
that place aa a result of three knife
wounds in the ab'lomen, inflicted by
Charles McPherson aL-out 11 o'clock last
night. The fight, of which this was the
result, has caused a tremendous sensa
tion.
According to Coates statement the act
was unprovoked. McPherson, he declares,
was under the influence of liquor and
was walking along second street with a
sack of apples when Coates and a friend
met him and informed him that he was
spilling the apples. McPherson did not
take kindly to the information, says
Coates, and used exceedingly vulgar lan
guage. Coates passed by and remarked
to his friend that he v*ould have McPher
son arrested. He turned around to go for
an officer when he met McPherson, who.
he asserts, without a word struck him
with a knife three times.
McPherson then departed, but was ar
rested a short time afterward at his
home. Coates was taken to his home and
Dr. Powell was called to attend his in
juries. Both men are residents of Yuba'
City. Coates has a wile and two children
and has always borne a good reputation.
McPherson, who is a painter, has resided
in the place but J-ix months. The doctor
gives little hope for Coates' recovery.
The knife was still in McPherson's pos
session when ne was arrested.
McPherson claims that he used the knife
in self-defense.
BRANNON REINSTATED
ON AMERICAN TURI
Horseman Implicated in Notorious
"Ringer" Cass Ends Long Period
of Ostracism.
CINCINNATI. Nov. 17.â William Bran
non, who for nearly a decade has suffered
ostracism from the American turf, has
been reinstated at Latonia.
The offense whioh made Mr. Brannon an
outcast was the supposed "ringing in" of
the noted old horse Tanner, under the
name of Polk Badget, at Latonia, on
which he cleaned up something like $30,000.
Brannon trained the horse on the pike
outside of Latonia, and nobody knew any
thing about him until after the coup had
been made. Polk Badget opened at 40 to 1
and was backed down to 8 to 5. Jockey
Keith had the mount and tried to make a
iloi^p finish, but the horse got his head and
finished away out in front.
Brannon never claimed the purse. Ha
cashed the tickets and walked the horse
to a stable in this city, and that night the
horse was hidden behind some freight in a
baggage car. painted to prevent recogni
tion by the officials and shipped direct to
Jersey City.
The trail got so hpt that the horse had
scarcely reached the stable there when he
was taken out and shipped to Hopkins
villet Term.
The horse is dead, as is the jockey who
rode him. Judge Perkins said he believed
Brannon had suffered punishment enough
and gave him reinstatement In the nature
of a pardon. '

RAPID DEATH
CLAIMS CACTI
Arizona Mourns Passing
of the Territorial
Flower.
Irrigation of Lands Promises
the Saguara's De
struction.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Nov. 17.â Tie placing
of water on the arid wastes of Arizona
lands and the consequent evolution from
desert to garden is driving to extinction
one of the strangest plants in all the
world.
At a recent session of the Territorial
Legislature the cercus giganteus, the
giant cactus, better known as the sa
guara, peculiar to the soil of this Terri
tory, was made the official flower of Ari
zona. Not many yeats will elapse until a
new choice will be made necessary.
When the first Franciscan fathers jour
neyed north from Mexico they took back
a report of the great cacti, sixty feet
long, which" covered Mie plains of the new
country, and told marvelous tales of the
food value of the new plant, of the In
dian tribes who subsic-.ed on the fruit of
the saguara and of The wonderful bene
fits In the liquor from its sap. As far as
the eye could reach btretched veritable
forests of these great sentinels of the
desert.
Now, as the science of the American
has reclaimed foot by foot the miles of
the former desert and the magic water
has made orange, peach and apricot or
chards and great fields of alfalfa, the sa
guara has fallen, and only in spots where
water cannot be placed can the odd plant
be found.
SPADES RISE
STRANGE BONES
Graders Near Cayucos
Unearth the Skele
tons of Men.
CAYUCOS, Cal., Nov. 17.â While laborers
were grading the approaches to a bridge
over the Torro Creek four miles from
Cayucos yesterday they unearthed with
spades a large number of human bones,
which appear to be the skeletons of eleven
men.
Some of the skeletons were in a sitting
posture and a few apparently had aba
lone rings in the ears and noses. Nu
merous other shell ornaments and uten
sils were found.
The skeletons were fairly well preserved.
It is believed that the site was originally
an old Indian burial ground, although
there Is no record that the spot was ever
used for such purpose.
STEADY GROWTH OF RURAL
FREE-DELIVERY SYSTEM
Civil Service May Be Extended to
That Branch of the Govern
ment Work.
WASHINGTON, Nov. I".âSuperintend
ent A. W. Machen of the free delivery
system of the Postoffice Department has
been in conference with the members of
Civil Service Commission in relation to^.
proposition to transfer the rural free de
livery branch of the Postofflce Depart
ment work to the classified service. This
system gradually has grown from a small
beginning to large proportions within the
past few years and as it was not included
in the classified service at the beginning
of its existence, appointments in that ser
vice have been made without regard to
the requirements of the civil service law.
There are now between 6000 and 7000 per
sons employed in this work, which ex
tends all over the United States and not
only the members of the commission but
the officials of the Postoffice Department
itself have come to the conclusion that
the service should be embraced in the
classified service.
Superintendent Machen went over the
ground thoroughly with the commission,
and while no positive conclusion was
reached, it was stated by both parties
to the conference that the present pros
pect for the extension of the civil service
rules to the rural free delivery is good
and it is quite certain that the extension
will be made. Some difficulty has been
experienced in determining what exam
ination the rural carriers should be sub
jected to, and it Is understood that an
arrangement has been reached whereby
a separate examination will be arranged
for them.

TIMELY SHEER
SAVES A SHIP
Steamer Horda Nearly
Crashes Through
a Vessel.
Narrow Escape of the Torri
don When Off the
Columbia.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA, Or., Nov. 17.â The British
ship Torridon, which arrived off the river
several days ago, had an almost miracu
lous escape from destruction last night,
when the Norwegian steamship Horda
narrowly missed cutting the Britisher In
twain.
The Horda was on her way down from
the Sound and arrived off the heads about
10 o'clock. The weather was very thick
at the time. Suddenly the lights of a
vessel were seen, but Captain Stevenson
of the Horda, thinking the vessel ahead
was the pilot schooner, continued on his
course, expecting the schooner would
stand under his lee and acquaint him with
his exact surroundings.
The lights rapidly came nearer and the
two vessels were almost together, when
the unknown ship flashed the danger sig
nals. At once the big steamship's en
gines were reversed and the vessel
sheered off her course. She passed within
a few feet of the Torridon, which had
been hugging the shore. Had the Horda
continued on her course for another min
ute she would certainly have cut the Tor
ridon in two.
The transport Rosecrans sailed to-day

118 Brcadway, Nov. 17.
From a notorious house on Fifth street
the police to-day rescued Mary McLaugh
ln, a girl said to be not more than 1? or
14 years of age. Chief of Police Hodgktns
also has in custody a woman known as
i Clara Wilson and a man, Frank Lewis,
about 40 years of age, who will be
charged with having placed the girl In
the resort, which is conducted by the Wil
son woman.
Behind the revolting â¢circumstances
which have been uncovered by the detec
tives is a cloud of mystery concerning
the identity of the girl and the man, who
have been in this city only two or three
days. They came here together, traveling
in a covered "prairie scnooner,"' drawn
by a pair of broken down horses. Ac
cording to Lewis, they had been roving
over Southern California. He asserted
that his child companion was his niece.
The police believe that the girl's home is
In some Southern California town. She
is slight and her appearance is all against
her claim that she is 18 years of age.
The police officials have commenced a
thorough investigation of the case. They
wi'l prosecute Lewis under a law which
makes the offense with which he will
be charged punishable by a long term
in a State penitentiary. The woman is
also subject to like punishment if she Is
convicted.
Chief Kodgkins has taken the case in
hand personally. He said to-day:
Two days ago information reached the de
partment about the arrival of this couple In
town. We set an inquiry on foot and this
morning procured sufficient evidence to arrest
tie parties, who are now In custody. The man
is shrewd and cunning. He refuses to disclose
anything by which we might trace his past.
Both himself and the child declare they are
uncle and niece. If that be so the case is all
the more astounding.
The girl is slight, frail and of tender years.
I have no doubt she is under 18 years of age
and she appears not a day over 14. Our in
formation Is that Bhe is only 13 years old.
Although Lewis iÂ« reticent I have no doubt
we shall shortly have his history, and I shall
make special effort to trace the girl back to
her relatives and her home.
Pending further investigation, the trio
will be held as "small book" prisoners.
Chief Hodgkins explained that he was
prepared to enter complaints against
Lewis and the Wilson woman at any
time if compelled to use that resort to
hold them.
RUMORS OF MAYOR-ELECT'S
DEATH CAUSES EXCITEMENT
Wild rumors were circulated last night
around town to the effect that Mayor
elect Eugene E. Schmitz had been acci
dentally killed during the afternoon at
Lathrop. Another rumor had it that the
accident occurred near Livermore. Infor
mation direct lrom the place where Mr.
Schmitz is sojourning near Watsonville
showed that the Mayor-elect had not
been injured and was enjoying the best
of health.
He spent yesterday jit the home of some
relatives near Watsonville. and had not
been in either of the towns where his
death was reported to have occurred. Mrs.
Driscoll. mother-in-lfiw of Mr. Schmitz.
stated last night that she had seen Mr.
Schmitz at noon and 'hat he was then in
the best of health.
The rumor was In all probability start
ed by some one who was under the influ
ence of liquor and unconscious of his
acts, or else by some one so malicious
that he took that means of venting a per
sonal spite. T'ue rumor for a time caused
great worry to Mr. Schmftz's friends in
this city. Had any accident occurred Mr.
Schmitz's relatives In this city would
have been notified, and the fact that they
have received no word stamps the rumors
as groundless. _

MUD SPOUTS
ON PROSPECTORS
Searchers for Oil Over
whelmed by the Vol
canic WelL
Column of Sand, Gravel and
Steam Still Rises From
Desert.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIO, Cal., Nov. 17.â The sensational
volcanic well of Volcano Springs con
tinues to throw up mud. sand and gravel,
but a gradual cessation is going on. This
morning the spouting column, was about
thirty feet high, where at first a conser
vative estimate gave the height at ninety
feet. At 7 o'clock this evening a dispatch
from there says that it ha 3 been checked
considerably during the day, owing most
likely to a caving beneath the cased por
tion of the well.
A short time ago the Volcano Springs
Oil Company had the well bored while
prospecting for oil of which there are
surface indications. The rig was in charga
of Waring, an expert driller. At a depth
of 300 feet a strong flow of hot salt water
was encountered. This was casÂ«d off
without much trouble and drilling was
resumed.
At 480 feet a ;ei of live steam came up
through the hollow drill rod on the upper
end of which there is a length of hose.
So strorg was this steam pressure that
it required three men to control the hoÂ»e
while uncoupling it. No sooner had that
been done than a large quantity of mud.
sand, gravel the size of walnuts, and hoc
water came upon the men where the pent
up gas and steam found vent at the sur
face.
This was at once followed by an erup
tion of mud and hot water. There was
no opportunity to disconnect all the gear
and much of It was damaged. It was a
weird, uncanny sight, that black column
of mud, interrupted at intervals by bodies
of steam and gases, which when they
came to the surface sounded very muchÂ»
like the exhaust of a heavily loaded lo
comotive. The extraordinary mud geyser
Is In a level, desolate section and can be
seen for miles.
ACCUSED OF STEALING
FROM HIS BENEFACTOR
August Heinstand, a Young Graduate
of Heidelberg University, ArTest
ed for Embezzlement.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 17.â August Hein
stand, a graduate of Heidelberg Univer
sity, whose father is said to be a land
Baron in Switzerland, was arrested to-day
on complaint of Henry Helm, a fellow
countryman, who charges Heinstand
with embezzling $100 from him.
Helm conducts a confectionery store on
Park street. Heinstand, who is 22 years
of age, recently arrived here from Europe.
Financial shortage afflicted him and he
came to Heim for assistance, the latter
having been a friend of the elder Hein
stand in Switzerland. Heim employed
the young man and allowed him to at
tend to some of the bill collecting. It was
during this time that Heim claims Hein
stand received and appropriated to hs
own uses $100 which did not belong to him.
Being unable to obtain bail, Heinatand
remains In the city prison.

JAPAN DOES NOT
FACE A PANIC
Government's New Pol
icy Checks Down
ward Movement.
Plans Sale of Bonds for Ex
tension of Railways and
Telegraphs.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â The Japanese
Minister has received telegraphic advices
from his Government which show that
the statements recently published con
cerning the existence of a financial panic
in Japan are unfound-jd. There have been
some fluctuations in the stock market, but
nothing of an alarming nature, and the
publication of the Government's new
financial scheme has checked effectually
the downward movement. The market is
now buoyant, Government securities be
ing quoted at higher rates than for some
time past.
The new scheme cor.templates the pro
vision of capital for the extension of rail
ways and telegraphs, which are yielding
a net pront of 7 per cent, by the sale of
bonds to the postal savings banks, the
utilization of itirplus i evenues from the
railroads and telegraphs and the sale
from time to time of such quantities of
bonds as can be absc: bed easily by the
domestic macket. The country has en
joyed one of the mot>i prosperous years
in its history. The lice and silk crops
have been unusually iarge, and there is
a steady influx of god as a result of the
trade. It is explained, the Minister fur
ther says, that the alleged panic was at
tributed to a loan failure. The result of
the inquiry was unfavorable only in so
far as it developed the existence of a cer
tain stringency here and in England, due,
the Minister says, to causes entirely dis
connected from any questions of Japanese
credit.
The prosecution of public works, tem
porarily placed in abeyance by the diver
sion of funds to der-ay the cost of the
expedition to China, has now been satis
factorily provided fo<\ and should any
further capital from abroad be hereafter
desired the Minister is satisfied that his
Government can affoid to wait until the
conditions are such that it can be ob
tained upon favorable terms.

BELIEVES READ
HAS ABSCONDED
Harness-Makers' Union
Suspects Treasurer
of Theft.
Investigation Is Said to Have
Disclosed a Small
Deficit
Walter W. Read, secretary and treas
urer of the Harness-Makers' Union has
been missing for more than a week and
it is feared by the harness-makers that
he has absconded -*ith a considerable por
tion of the funds which the union had en
trusted to his cane. To what sum his
Mipposed defalcations will amount can
only be determined after his accounts
have been examined. It is known that
Head had In his possession previous to
his disappearance $2uO, the per capita tax
which tne local Harness-Makers Union
])a\!< Into the treasurer of its national
o'ay. A telegram has been sent to the
ary of the national body to ascer
tain whether or not the per capita tax was
lorwarded to him.
At a meeting of the Harness-Makers'
Union, held last Saturday night, the ex
ecutive committee, consisting of Thomas
Simpkins, William Noble and W. A.
MeeKs, was directed to expert Treasurer
Read's accounts. Although the committee
has not as yet officially made known the
results of its labors, it is understood by
the members of the union that a deficit
has been found to exist. The investiga
tion is said to have brought to light the
fact that Read has diverted sick benefits
to his own use. For the maintenance of
strikers the 260 members of the union had
been contributing 25 cents per week and
i is rumored that this sum also found its
Â¦way into the treasurer's pocket. The rent
for the hall in which the union convenes
each week is also in arrears.
The last seen of the absent treasurer
by his associates was a week ago last Sat
urday, when he gave up his work at
Kempkey &. Gilham's, taking his tools
with him. Inquiries at 35 Woodward
street, where his wife and child are re
siding, failed to elicit any information as
to his whereabouts. Read was considered
by his associates to be an honest man
and the Harness-Makers' Union in select
ing him to be their treasurer did not exact
any bonds from him.
Robert H. McCallum, president of the
Harness-Makers' Union, in speaking about
Read's disappearance, said last night that
he did not think the treasurer's defalca
tions would exceed $200. as the union was
accustomed lo pay 80 per cent of its re
ceipts into the treasury of its national
body. He also stated that Read had given
bonds to the amount of $500 to the Na
tional Harness-Makers' Union so that his
shortage in that direction would be entire
ly covered.
HIS LIFE CRUSHED OUT
BETWEEN FREIGHT CARS
Body of Peter Ramsey Is Found at
the Second-Street
Slip.
Peter Ramsey, second officer of the
freight boat Transit, was killed at the
Second-street slip yesterday morning and
his body was taken to the Morgue. No
one saw the accident, but it is supposed
ht- was crushed between cars.
Shortly after 2 o'clock Ramsey went to
the office of Frank W. Clapp, the night
watchman, to read the papers, as was his
usual custom. After reading the news
he left the office and shortly afterward
his dead body was found under a car on
the track at the foot of the slip. At the
time cars were being shunted on to the
boat.
Ramsey was about 60 years of age, mar
ried and lived in Oakland.
George Cornelius, the engineer, was ar
rested about 5 o'clock by Policemen
Clancy and Jordan and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of manslaughter. He
was released on $50 cash bail.
Special Officer Doyle in Trouble.
Special Officer John Doyle was locked
up early yosterday morning on a charge of
drunkenness. Doyle was going along Mar
ket street at 3 o'clock in the morning
laboring under the impression that the
sidewalks were in open rebellion against
him. After straightening himself up
against a lamppost he seized the first
man who cajne his way, which happened
to be a man named Conway. Exhibiting
his star and pistol, Doyle placed Conway
under arrest and took him to the City
Hall station, where he charged him with
being drunk. Sergeant Wolf, who was
in the prison at the time, instructed Desk
Officer White not to book Conway, as he
was perfectly sober. Kot so, however,
with Doyle, who was staggering about
the prison desk making much of his au
thority and threatening every one jn
sight with dire punishment unless they
obeyed his instructions. A charge of
drunkenness was entered against the spe
cial. The Police Commissioners will in
terview him to-morrow night and most
probably he will be a very plain citizen
on Wednesday morninc-.
Captain Barnesoifs Mother Dead.
Mrs. Elizabeth Bameson, mother of
Captain John B. Barneson of the United
State Army transport service, died last
night at her residence, 41 Belvedere street.
She was a native of Scotland, over 65
year? of age, and leaves another son,
James 8.. and a daughter, Mrs. W.
x.ewin. The funeral will take place to
morrow morning at 11 o'clock from her
late residence. The interment, which will
be private, will be at Cypress Lawn Cem
etery.

NOTED EASTERN EDUCATORS WILL
ADDRESS TEACHERS' CONVENTION
Elisha Benjamin Andrews of Nebraska and M. Vincent O'Shea of
Wisconsin to Lecture at the Pacific Grove Session*
* â _ â
THE California Teachers' Associa
tion will meet at Pacific Grove
on December 30 to hold Its thirty
fifth annual session. Arrange
ments have been made to secure
the presence at the convention of some
of the best educators in the country.
Richard D. Faulkner, principal of the
Franklin Grammar School and President
of the Teachers' Association, announced
yesterday that among the distinguished
visitors would be Elisha Benjamin And
rews, LL. D.i chancellor of the Univer
sity of Nebraska, and M. Vincent Shea,
professor of the science and art of edu
cation at the University of Wisconsin.
The convention will be in session from
December 30 to January 3, both dates in
clusive.
Dr. Andrews is a graduate of Brown
University, of which institution he was
in 1889 elected president. In 1892 he was
appointed by President Harrison one of
the members of the International Mone
tary Conference at Brussels. He served
as superintendent of schools in Chicago
from 1898 until August 1900, when he en
tered upon his duties as chief executive
of one of the most progressive educa
tional institutions in the West, the State
University of Nebraska. As an educator
his reputation is world-wide and his" pres
ence at the Pacific Grove convention
promises to be a valuable experience for
the teachers of this state.
M. Vincent O'Shea is a graduate of
Cornell. He joined the faculty of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin in 1897, teaching for
the first year educational psychology, â¢
child study, principles of teaching, and
method of recitation. He has since
added to these, mental development,
genetic psychology and observation and
practice of teaching. He is well known as
a writer and lecturer on educational sub
jects. Both he and Dr. Andrews will de
liver a number of addresses before the
teachers' association.
HIS ACCOUNTS
IN BAD TANCLE
Barbers Examine Books
of Their Missing
Secretary.
All yesterday afternoon and evening the
executive committee of Journeymen Bar
bers' Union No. 148 was engaged in an
investigation of the accounts of its late
secretary, I. Less, who is charged with
having misappropriated some of the funds
of the organization. The work was very
tedious, as there were a large number of
accounts to be gone over, and there was
no way of checking them, until each indi
vidual member of the union could be
heard from.
From the evidence adduced yesterday
it was apparent that there had been some
little Juggling with funds prior to the
time that Less entered the political field
as the Union Labor party candidate for
Auditor. It is said that when Less found
that he could not get the nomination for
Public Administrator, and accepted the
other nomination, he was promised finan
cial support to make his campaign. This
failed to materialize and in order to keep
up his end of the fight he utilized the
funds of the union, his salary of $20 a
week only being sufficient for the support
of his family.
During the latter days of the campaign
some of the members of the union com
plained that they were not properly cred
ited with payments upon the books of
the union, but Less was ready with the
excuse that politics took up so much of
his time that he did not have a chance to
check oft his books, and was granted until
after the election to make such correc
tions as might be necessary.
Other complaints were made and the
matter began to look serious. One day
last week George F. Aubertin, the presi
dent of the union, was appealed to and
took charge of the office. Less was sus
pended and an investigation commenced.
Less absented himself from his usual
haunte and inquiries for him at his home
were futile.
When the executive committee met at
the headquarters yesterday afternoon
some of the members were in favor of
taking drastic measures, but as there was
no definite charge upon which action
could be taken until the examination of
the books was completed it was decided
to present a progressive report to the
union to-night and let that body deter
mine upon further action. .
Less is said to be still in the city, and
while the union is protected by a bond, it
is said his relatives intend making good
I any shortage that may be found. Neither
Less nor any of his relatives could be
found at their homes yesterday.
Branch Express Office.
Wells, Fargo and Comnany have opened

residents of that neighborhood to whom
the necessity for going down town is a
considerable inconvenience.

EASTERN CROOK
LANDS IN JAIL
James Bruce, Wanted in
Chicago, Arrested in
This City.
James Bruce, alias "Slippery Jim," a
notorious Eastern crook, who is wanted
in ChicagA for the theft of diamonds val
ued at several thousand dollars, is locked
up in the City Prison. He was arrested
Saturday afternoon by two of Captain
Seymour's men just as he was about to
board the transport Meade.
In some way the police of Chicago
learned that Bruce had secured a position
as a waiter aboard the Meade, and they
wired Captain Seymour to arrest him.
Two detectives were sent, and aft
er boarding the transport they pa
tiently waited for the crook to appear.
Shortly before the transport pulled out
into the stream Bruce, partially disguised,
walked up the gangplank and was at once
recognized by Lie detectives. When ques
tioned he denied that his ' name was
Bruce or that he had ever been in Chi
cago. Satisfied that he was the right
man the detectives took him to police
headquarters, where alter a severe cross

HURLS A LAMP
AT POLICEMAN
Colored Woman Vicious
ly Attacks Officer
Duane.
Sallie Jones, a colored denizen of the
Barbary Coast, threw a lighted coal oil
lamp at Police Officer Duane last night,
breaking his nose and setting fire to hid
new uniform.
Duane had gone into the woman's home
to arrest her for grand larceny, when
she picked up the lamp, which was on a
small table in the center of the room,
and hurled it at him. The lamp struck
Duane on the nose and exploded, the
burning oil setting fire to the sleeve of
his uniform. After extinguishing the
blaze Duane seized the woman and drag
ged her from the house. She was then
taken to the City Prison and booked on
charges of gTand larceny and assault
with a deadly weapon.
While patrolling his beat on Pacific
street Duane was accosted by Joe Man
chini, a cook, who informed him that the
Jones woman had robbed him of $3 in a
house on Pinckney place. Accompanied by
Manchini, Duane went to the house and
proceeded to question the woman about
the robbery. For a reply she picked up
the lighted lamp and threw it at him.
After being placed under arrest the des
perate woman fought viciously to escape.
She clawed the policeman's face and vain
ly attempted to bite his hand. With the
assistance of a citizen, Duane finally man
aged to get his dusky prisoner to the Cen
tral station, where she was formally
charged. â¢â¢ â¢
examination he broke down and admitted
his identity.
Since leaving Chicago Bruce, who It is
claimed is one of the most expert sneak
thieves in the country, has made several
trips to Sydney and other foreign ports,
robbing the passengers of their valuables.
A short time ago he was employed as a
waiter on an ocean liner, and when the
vessel reached its destination he sudden
ly disappeared. Nothing was thought or
his disappearance until the following day.
when one of the passengers discovered
that his trunk had been broken open dur
ing the trip and jeweliy and other prop
erty valued at over $1000 stolen.
Suspicion at once attached to Bruce, and
the police of various ports were asked to
arrest him. From the description given
of the thief the police of Chicago recog
nized him as the man who was wanted
for an unusually bold diamond robbery
committed in that city.
It is expected that an officer will leave
Chicago to-day for this city to take
charge of the prisoner.

MINERS DISCUSS
KLONDIKE PLOT
Hatred of Canadian Rule
Is Strong Along
Border.
Mounted Police Will Probably
Be Able to Control
Situation.
The, story of conspiracy against Can
fcdian rule in the Klondike and the con
ference at Skagway November 5 of the
Civil and military representatives of the
United States and the Northwest Terri
tory, as published exclusively in yester
flay's call, was the subject of much dig
cusslon during the day in clubs and hotel
lobbies. Men recently rrom the gold
fields were particularly interested, and all
phases of the plot and its discovery were
discussed among them over and over
fcgain.
To many the plans of the conspirators
seem so chimerical that action on them
does not seem the part of sane men, but
curiously enough old Klonclikers were
strongest in the defense or the credibility
of the story. Knowing the bitterness of
all classes of miners, and particularly of
Americans, toward the Dominion Gov
ernment and appreciating the dare devil
character of a large part of the population
of the mining camps, they hold that it
is not at all astounding that reckless
spirits should band together and pledge
themselves to risk all and set up the
standard of rebellion against the Domin
ion. Six months' immunity from attack,
argue these returned gold hunters, must
have been a strong argument brought to
bear upon the more cautious to induce
them to give sanction to the plot, and the
difficulties of Invasion even during the
short summer are so evident that many
doubtless feel a confidence in the ability
of a force of 6000 men to defend the ter
ritory against whatever force might be
sent against them.
There is little appreciation in the States
of the implacable hatred of thousands of
American miners along the Porcupine and
other creeks near the border for the Can
adian Government. They believe unalter
ably that they ought to be under Ameri
can rule and that they have been com
pelled unjustly to submit to the hated
Canadian mining regulations. They feel
that Americans at home must share their
bitterness and that the nation would give
them moral support in a revolt against
the Dominion Government. Those famil
iar with conditions in the mining camps
do not hesitate to say that the backbone
of the strength upon which the arch-con
spirators have counted must lay along the
border, in the Atlin district. They assert
also that much bitterness exists in Dawson
and elsewhere well into the Interior, such
as would make the promotion of an insur
rection a comparatively easy matter, once
the leaders could give assurance of tem
porary success at least.
It was generally held that the discovery
of the existence of the plot will mean
death to the cause, for although it is al
ready too late for aid to be rushed in to
reinforce the mounted police, it is beliered
that knowledge of the danger will place
it in the power of the authorities to cope
with the conspirators. In fact the vigi
lance of the police is likely to prevent any
uprising, and returned miners believe that
it will now be mainly a matter of ferret-
Ing out further evidence and running to
earth the ringleaders.

Great Gymnasium for Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 17.â
The rumor in regard to the proposed new
gymnasium for the accommodation of the
university students has been confirmed
by Resident Architect Charles E. Hodges.
He has made the announcement that
plans will be prepared at an early date
for an immense structure even more elab
orate than the students had at first hoped
for.
The cost of the building will run up into
the tens of thousands, and possibly more
than a hundred thousand dollars. Among
the details Mrs. Stanford has specified to
be embodied in the plans are a billiard
room, bowling alleys, handball courts, ex
hibition hall, indoor running track and
an immense swimming tank.
