P m \ HE most impressive con-
I demnation that the city
1 of San Francisco is capa
*â¢ ble of bestowing upon
the Examiner for its teachings,
that have led to riots,, anarchy
and the culminating crime of the
assassination of the President ot
the United States, was bespoken
yesterday. Representatives of
every commercial body in the
city, grave, conservative and paÂ»
triotic men, met and adopted res
olutions in joint session, recom
mending that the Examiner
should be taken from the file 1 ' of
all the great organizations for
whom they acted, calling also
upon all members of the various
associations and all other law
abiding citizens to withhold all
patronage and news from the
censured paper. . Realizing that
the evils of the yellow journal are
not confined to any one locality,
but that all suffer alike from its
influence, delegates 1 to the con
ference also asked all other or
ganizations in the State to take
action similar to theirs. Men of
affairs forsook their business at
the busiest part of the day to
meet and formulate a striking
memorial of their disapprobation
of the course of the Examiner.!

This morning in an examination by

the pistol which was taken off him last
night.
Petersen admitted at once to the Chief
that he belonged to an anarchist society,
and, when the name of President McKln

that he hoped all rulers would go the
same way. He would assist in sending
them, he said, and the sooner they were
out of the way the better.
A charge of vagrancy, as well' as of car
rying concealed weapons, was preferred
against him, and he will be held for a
month at least. -Half a dozen other ar

Kirch and Meyer entered through the
manhole first without taking the precau

They were immediately overcome by the
fumes and Foreman Newman started
down after them, after ;-shouting a warn
ing to the other workmen in. the yard.
He, too, collapsed in. the tank.
Nicholas Miller, summoning other em
ployes, began with chisels to cut a large
ring in the tank. It :, is supposed one of
the chisels, in striking. the steel, caused
the emission of a 'spark, for instantly
there was an explosion like that , of a
cannon and then a sheet of flame. The
men were hurled high in the air and the
tank, was rent in twain. \ Every. bone in

Lincoln's casket was chiseled open to
day and eighteen persons gazed upon the
features of the long dead first martyred
President and great emancipator. â¢. Then
the casket holding all that was | mortal
of the honored dead was finally laid away
for the thirteenth time. Lincoln was Â«a
busy man throughout his life. His friends
have been buey with his remains since
his death. Previous to to-day the casket
was moved from its resting place twelve
times- Each removal was thought to be
the Jast. Now it is declared there can
never again be any occasion for disturb
ing the resting place, which is inside an
ir_.n cage imbecded in a huge block of
cement beneath the tomb of the Lincoln
monument in Oak Ridge Cemetery. After
a short meeting of the monument com
mittee a.t the State House word was
quietly sent to those who were expected
to be present and the entire party-as
eembled at the monument. A conference
followed in the Memorial Hall of the
monument and the matter of opening the
casket to the liglit of day was discussed.
Some of those present said they did not
care to lock upon the remains, but those
who favored the proposition insisted that
it was not a matter of wishes, but one
cf identification to be made a matter of
record for all time to come. Under this
argument the wooden box containing the
casket ahd remains was carried from the
north side of the monument to Memorial
Hail on the south side. Here the casket
was opened and the features were gazed
upon by those who had seen them before
for the purpose of identification and they
declared them to be in a good state of
preservation. The casket was then re
pealed and consigned to the place pre
pared for the same in the monument.

Hullah-Barnhart Recital.
The first piano and vocal recital of Miss
Annette Hullah and Harry H. Barnhart
was given last night at Sherman & Clay
Hall before a large and friendly audience.
The two new Â¦ candidates for favor, who
both made their first Californian appear
ance last evening, have immediately
stepped into a sure and high place among
musicians here, and are indeed valuable
acquisitions to the vocal and pianistic
forces of the city. Miss Hullah, a dainty'
and charming little lady, is a pupil of
Leschetizky's and shows her admirable^
eehooling at every turn. She has a round,
rich tone, the beautiful Leschetizky stac
cato, and a broad, scholarly grasp of the
compositions rendered. Miss Hullah's
programme was Interesting, but perhaps
not sufficiently picturesque, though she
was received with marked enthusiasm.
Mr. Barnhart was also much enjoyed,
and showed himself the possessor of a
truly splendid bass voice of wide range,
excellent quality and highly cultivated.
He has also much dramatic power and
musical sympathy, and created a most
favorable Impression upon his audience.
Mr. Oscar Maurer accompanied In his
usual artistic fashion. Miss Hullah's
numbers were the following:
Variattone In- G, Mozart; "Lleder ohne

COURT HOLDS SHORT SESSION.
Adjournment Taken on Account of
Funeral of Judge Wilson.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.â The Schley 'court
of inquiry began its session to-day with the
intention of holding one sitting, having de
cided to forego the afternoon session in order
to permit the members of j the counsel and
court to attend the funeral of Judge . Wilson.
The -counsel for the Navy Department to-day
continued their efforts to show that Admiral
Schley had information of Admiral Cervera
and his fleet in the harbor of Santiago and in
troduced for this purpose additional officers of
the auxiliary cruisers which were at the time
doing oYity as scout boats In West Indian
waters.
Captain Wise who commanded the scout ship
Yale during the Spanish war, continued . his
narrative of the retrograde movement of the
flying squadron toward Key West on May 27.
He first told how the Yale nad taken the
Merrlmac in tow under direction of Admiral
Schley. He said that the admiral had signaled
upon starting to ask If there was coal enough
to carry him to Key West, to which he ; had
responded in the affirmative. On the,next day
he had reported in response to an inquiry that
he had coal sufficient for two days -of full
steaming and for four days of' moderate
steaming. ....
| He was then dispatched to Newport Isews,
reporting to Admiral Sampson on the way.
He had told Admiral Sampson, he. said, that
the flying squadron was about thirty miles west
of Santiago. In response to a. question of the
admiral he had said he did not know what
it was doing there. In detailing the trip west
ward toward Key West, the witness told of the
breaking of the Yale's hawser -on the ller
rimac. He said this" had caused delay.
."What was the difficulty?" asked Captain
"Improper securing of hawser on the Merrl
mac." '. -

LOS ANGELESrSept. 26.â At the South
ern California Methodist Conference this
morning the Rev. John Thompson spoke
briefly on the" theme of Bible "distribu
tion,'., declaring; that the best way to fight
anarchy.: was to put the Bible into; the
hands of the people, adding, that he. be
lieved with Abraham Lincoln that' "mercy
to the individual is cruelty -to 'the 'state';"!
at;d he was in favor oÂ£ vigorous measures
with those anarchists . who could not be
moved with the Bible.
at first' I said It was absolutely necessary;
that we were almost out of -. coal, , having made
the run from Key West." -He said: ''Very well;
go below and I Â¦ will think it over.'
"I went below to' the wardroom and was
afterward up . and informed that they
would give" me coal. : I had never before met
the admiral. . He impressed me as being very
nervous. He would get up and walk around,
come back . and sit down,, and . a..number.i of
questions he asked me about Admiral Samp
son's intentions I was unable to answer."
HP Schley Appeared to Be ITenrous. ~
"If - I understand you clearly, you had no
knowledge of . the contents of the . dispatches
which you delivered?" . " ' V ': r -

at '11:30 a. m. on the 20th." , r ' Â¦: =Â¦'- - â¢
"During this interview in which you made

read them in your presence?" Â¦Â¦'Â¦'. 'Â¦-â¢Â¦' .
"Oh, yes." . ..Â¦Â¦'Â¦ Â¦ â¢ ' "..':
"Did he advise you of their contents then?" ,
"He did , not "tell "me " positively" what" they
were. I gathered- while I was aboard the flag-;
ship what they contained, but whether it -was
while I was in the cabin or later in the ward-,
room I do not know. I never saw their con
tents and Admiral Sampson never told me what
they were." .' t-f* ;â¢Â¦ '"'_,..' '.''
"I wish to ascertain exactly the particulars
of this interview." :
"All the dispatches seemed to be of an im
portant, character, judging from the admiral's
manner upon receiving them. As I stated, he
was very nervous." . â¢ . -'â¢'
Asked by Raynor if Admiral Sampson or any
one else had informed him before he left Key
West for Ciehfuegos that a code of signals had
been agreed upon between the American forces
and the Cuban- insurgents, Lieutenant , Wood
replied in the negative. He had not, he said,
received such Information officially, but he
added that it was current talk' at Key West
that the Marblehead on a previous trip had es
tablished communication with the Cubans. If,
however, a code had been arranged he did not
know of the fact. Before Lieutenant Wood had
concluded his testimony the court at 12:45 ad
journed for the day to permit attendance at
Judge Wilson's funeral. â¢ <'

" '."Have you anything further to state with
respect to this interview which will bear on
the subject of this inquiry?"
"The commodore hesitated some about giving
me coal. He did not think he could spare coal.
".Â¦"On my arrival," the witness said, "I went
aboard and personally delivered the dispatches,
which I carried from Admiral Sampson J to
Commodore Schley, In his cabin, at 9 o'clock.
He -asked me Admiral Sampson's idea about
where the Spanish squadron was. I told him
I did not know; he asked me of Admiral Samp
son's intentions. I told him I did not know
them. He told me he thought the Spanish
squadron was there. The conversation was
on .the line to endeavor to find out from me
what Admiral Sampson's plans were. I could
give him no information."
'.'How long were you on board the flagship?"
- "Until just before luncheon." j
- Â¦ Lieutenant Wood related the particulars of
liis mission as a dispatch carrier from Admiral
Sampson lying at Key West to Admiral Schley,
who ,was off Cienfuegos. He had- left Key.
West' on May 20, carrying dispatches of which
.the Iowa carried duplicates, and had reached
: Cienfuegos several hours in advance of the
Iowa. . * â¢Â¦
The witness said that the'reversal was very
brief. : the revolutions not exceeding . 100, and
the K time being short. He had, he said, heard
afterward that the reversal was because they
were passing the Brooklyn. Lieutenant Spen
cer. S., Wood, who commanded the dispatch
-boat Dupont during the Spanish war, was the
next: witness.
"The next signal," he said, "was to stop
a minute "afterward to reverse. The engines
were then reversed." . ; - , . Â¦Â¦-Â¦_Â¦ ,
Anxious to Know the Plans.
Â¦, William C. Gray, who was chief machinist
on the Texas during the battle off Santiago on
July 3, testified that on that date he had been
on duty at. the throttle of the starboard engine
of the battleship. He said that when he went
to the engine-room the vessel w^s going ahead.
"There" was, of course, some further conver
sation. I' cannot recall the words nor aside
from what .1 have mentioned, the particular
subjects."' . - . Â¦
Lemlyâ Anything further.
"In language, as 1 nearly as I can remember,
he said:, 'After dinner I am going to hoist
my flag on board the Massachusetts, and take
her and the Iowa and go in and have a pot
shot at those fellows.' "
"He informed me that It had been ascer
tained that some, at least, of the ships of
Admiral Cervera's squadron were within the
harbor of Santiago; that, they had been seen
and were in sight and, as a matter of fact,
one of them was in sight at the entrance to
the harbor.
Asked by Captain Lemly to relate^ his con
versation with Admiral Schley on the occa
sion of that visit, he said:
Admiral Cotton was . questioned concerning
some points of the Santiago campaign. â¢" He
said that on the morning of May 31, after
arriving from Kingston, he had gone aboard
the Brooklyn with dispatches for Admiral
Schley.
At this point Captain "Wise -was excused and
Admiral Cotton was recalled to make verbal
corrections in the testimony previously given
by him. - . - . .
"I did not." ,
agk you for any Information at any time?
"Nothtnz." .. ' Â¦ . . Â¦ Â» . i
. Raynor continued his questions, devoting him
selt especially -to the signaling between' the
Yale and the flagship. - The witness said he was
eure that on May 26, when he hailed the. Texas,
he had not passed within, hailing" distance of
the Brooklyn, being one and a half miles dis
tant. . . â¢ ... .- . , Â¦/. â¢. . Â¦
Raynor read -from a Â¦ report made on. May 30
by Admiral Sampson In whlcn ne stated that
Captain Wise had told him that he believed
Santiago harbor to be . strongly fortified.
"Is that, true?" Raynor asked.. Â¦Â¦Â¦ -
"It is," was the reply. - -
Captain Wise said in reply to questions by
Captain Parker that he would â¢ at any time
Â¦when on* Santiago have been able to signal any
information he might have had in regard to
the situation. He had seen the masts of a ves
sel and thought .It' to be a small military ves
sel. He had gone near enough to observe the
land batteries. ' â¢ '. > .-.-; - . â¢
In Â¦ reDly to an inquiry \ from the court the
witness said; that the land batteries did not fire
on the Yale while that vessel was reconnoiter
ing the harbor. He also said that even though
he had been the senior officer oft Santiago prior
to the arrival of Captain Cotton, he had not
commanded Captain Sigsbee to give to Commo
dore Schley the information which he (Wise)
had given to him (Siersbee) ..Â» .. .
The questions by the court and the -replies
to them tvere as follows:
"Did the batteries at or near Santiago fire
on the Yale while she was reconnoitering?"
Admiral Cotton Makes Corrections.
"Not at all.".' ' " .Â¦
"Who was the senior officer off Santiago
prior to the arrival of the flying squadron?"
"I was senior officer until Captain Cotton
came, on the 23d. He was there until the
24th, and I was senior officer on the 25th,
and the squadron . came there on the 26th.".
"Did you not direct Captain Sigsbee to give
to Commodore Schley the information that you
had received from the Navy Department with
regard to the: whereabouts of the Spanish
squadron?" - . .

the members of the Humbcldt

HUMBOLDT COUNTY
IS '.'.MUCH INCENSED
When the meeting was first
proposed, a few days ago,. it was
not supposed that more than two
commercial organizations would
be represented. The Merchants'
Association was at first expected
to take up the matter to-day aft
er the meeting at the rooms of
the Board of Trade, where the
conference of yesterday took
place. But the news having
been circulated among the mer
chants and other representative
citizens that the action of the
Chamber of Commerce Was to be
followed up, there was a general
movement in favor of con
certed action, it being deemed
that such a manifestation would
be more significant of the senti
ment of all classes concerned in
censuring the Examiner. This
pressure was not resisted. On
Tuesday of this week frequent
conferences were held among the
prominent men of business who
are officially connected with one
or another organization. The re
sult was that the hall of the San
Francisco Board of Trade was

first of the cup races of 1901. But the ex

great single stickers went out this morn

fused them a field of conflict. The wind,
never more than nine and sometimes as
low as three knots, was too light and
ehifty to carry the contestants over the
thirty-mile course In the time allotted by
the rules. At the end of five and a half
hours, the prescribed time, the race was
ofllcially declared off and the yachts were
towed back to their berths inside Sandy

the Columbia off shore in. the hope of
meeting it. Instead he poked his nose
into a dead calm, and for some minutes
the Columbia lay with her sails flapping
while the Shamrock, catching a slant of
wind nearer shore, drew rapidly ahead
But the victory was shortlived. The cant
of the wind to the southward held and

shivered thorn with the force of her Im

chines looked too frail to carry tho canvas
which towered above them. About 150 feet

At flve minutes before 11 o'clock the pre
paratory signal for the race was given.
Then began the Jockeying behind the line,
of which Charles Barr, the American
skipper, has proved himself so many
times a grand master. And the skill he
dispRiyed to-day was enough to warm the
cockles of those who saw it. He got Into
the windward berth, and try as the Eng

As the red. ball which marked the warn

the English skipper, in despair, put up
his tiller, crossed the line and tacked
about the lightship, but tho Colombia
hung to him as if one tiller were answer
ing for both and when they again raced
for the line it was like two thoroughbred
horses neck and neck. But Barr was* still

To sum up to-day's performance of the
two yachts. It may be â¢ said that In light
weather such as prevailed- to-day the
Shamrock proved to be no match for the
Columbia. What she may accomplish
with a good wind remains to be seen.
Slow in Sail Setting. .
The Shamrock made a very good turn,
but was quite Blow in setting her Jib top
nail, which was one of the variety known
as "reachlnÂ«c" sails nnd not a-ballooneV.
It was excellent Judgment on the part of
the experts on the Shamrock to set this
sail, for the wind headed tho Columbia
soon after, making it a rather close reach
to the home mark, and rendering It neces
sary to take In the ballooncr and replace
it with one similar to that on the Sham
rock.
The official time at the outer mark fol
lows:
Columbia, 3:05:32.
Shamrock, 3:12:47. '
The wind continued so light and no
signs of breezing up that it /became clear
that the race could' not be concluded
within the time limit of five and a half
hours. No incident worth recording oc
curred until 4:40; when the regatta com
mittee declared the race off. The Colum
bia was at this time about five miles dis
tant from the Sandy Hook lightship.- The
Shamrock was a good three-quarters of a
mile astern. s â¢

Tho Columbia was first- to reach the
scene of the start, being towed from her
moorings out to Sandy Hook lightship.
Her mainsail was set, but it took her
skipper some time to decide what sized
gaff topsail to send aloft. The breeze at
10 o'clock was blowing about ten knots an
hour from east-northeast, and ' it then
looked as though it must Increase.' At
last it was decided to set the biggest club
topsail aboard,' and a' very pretty, sail it
was when mastheaded and sheeted; .The
Columbia took quite kindly to the swell
that rolled in from the sea. She 'made
several tacks around the lightship before
her rival appeared on the scene.
The Shamrock, with her -mainsail and
big club topsail hoisted and her headsails
set -in stops, passed out "by the point of
the Hook In tow. It waB noticed that she
splashed the water about considerably
and pitched heavily In; the long ground
swell. About half-way out to Sandy Hook
lightship the towline was cast off and the
headsails "were broken out. Her canvas
sot admirably. Never was a finer set of
sails seen on a cup challenger. Â¦ â¢ -. -. â¢

*>Tho Columbia did very well under the
circumstances. We inn. do a good start,
but of course the other boat may be more

The Kngllshman tried half a dozen head
sails in the hope of improving his posi
tion, but tho American forged steadily
ahead. Then tho wind, which had been
neven knots at tho stukehont, gradually
died down, and on hour before tho tlma

desperation concluded to press on more
canvas by trying a larger jib topsail.
While the sailors were out on the bow
sprit, taking in the old and bending on
the larger sails, the Columbia wentvby the
Shamrock as if she had been moored to
the dock, making two feet to her one.
From that time to the outer mark the Co
lumbia gained steadily. As she -came
alongside the turning point, leaving' the
mark on the starboard hand, Barr put his
helm hard down and luffed around it.
Then she filled away. Her great balloon
jib broke out like a puff of smoke., her
boom was eased off and she was away for
homo on a broad ! reach. The bands
crashed, the whistles blew and the crowd
aboard the excursion fleet cheered. The
fleet courteously waited until tho Sham
rock rounded seven minutes and four sec
onds later, and gave her a cordial recep
tion. From that time on it was a proces-
Eion, not o race.
The day had promised well at first. A
strong northeast wind had been blowing
for two days and the weather prophets
had offered assurance that it would hold.
It had piled up what the pallors call n
nasty lump sea outside and before the
race began wan whipping the foam 'off
the crests of the waves. A heavy haze
which hung over the bay had blown away
the bright sunlight which gilded the
crinkling water Into glory.
The procession that Bailed out of New
York harbor anticipated a fine day's
sport. So numerous were the â¢ various
kinds of craft that they seemed to fill the
broad expanse of ocean between the Long
Island and Jersey shores as with a count
less fleet. They Included palatial steam
yachts, Etcamers and excursion boats
tilled tier above tier with people, snub
nosed tugs, pfcnlc barges and numerous
other craft.

hand here at this time and which the law
provides, why sentence should not be now
pronounced against you, and Is defined by
the statute. The ilrst is that you may
claim that you are Insane; the next Is
that you have Rood cause to offer either
in arrest of the Judgment about to be pro
nounced against you or for a new trial.
Thoso are the grounds speclllcd by the
statute on which you have a right to
speak at this time, and you arc at perfect
liberty to do so If you wish."
The prisoner replied:
"I have nothing to say about that."
The court naid:
"Are you ready?"
Penney replied:
"Yes.
"Have you anything to say?" asked Jus
tice White.
At this point Justice White told those
in the courtroom that they must be quiet
or they would be excluded from the room.
Penney then said to the prisoner:
â¢'Czolgosz. the court wants to know If
you have any reason to give why sentence
Fhould not be pronounced against you.
Have you anything to say to the Judge?
Say yes or no."
Clerk Fisher repeated his question and
Czolgosz replied:
"I would rather have this gentleman
here. speak," looking: toward District At
torney Penney. "I can hear him better."

MADERA, Sept. 26.â The bulls had an
inning to-day an* the fighters had many
narrow escapes from being gored. A
smaller inclosure was built within the
large one, and this kept the bulls from
getting too far from the matadors. Tho
consequence was that tho fighting was
more exciting than on any previous day.
While closely pressed by a bull Captain
Ramltos fell and was struck by the bull's

IMPERIL MEN
Just before the train pulled- out a Call
correspondent saw Czolgosz seated easily
in a seat and smoking a cigar. In the
seat with the prisoner was Jailer Mitchell
and surrounding him were several armed
officers. These precautions were taken
because the authorities received word
from some source to-day that the Sheriff
might encounter considerable difficulty in
getting the prisoner to Auburn. Just
what sort of trouble was feared could not
be learned, but great care was taken that
no advance news of the departure of the
train was telegraphed along the line.

Tho moment the car arrived Czolgosz
appeared handcuffed to Jailer Mitchell
and surrounded by the Sheriff and his
deputies and Chief McMaster of the Au
burn Polite Department. The news that
a car containing the assassin was on the
track spread rapidly.
Czolgosz wan "snoukod" out the ' bnck
entrance of tho Erlo County Jail, sur
rounded by tho seventeen men, and was
hustled into tho gpcclal car which had
been hacked down on the terrace tracks a
few rods In the rear of tho Jail a minute
before. Sheriff Caldwell arranged for tho
departure, and his moves were kept so
secret ana were so cleverly managed that
no one but tho guards, the railroad men
anrt tho newspaper men who were In tho
Jail knew that the assassin was being
smuggled out of tho jail.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1901.
When Called Upon for a Statement in Court the Cowardly Anarchist
Falteringly Whispers That He Did Not Have Any Accom
plices, and That He Alone Is Responsible for the Awful Crime
SLAYER OF PRESIDENT MCKINLEY
SENTENCED TO BE PUT TO DEATH
IN THE ELECTRIC CHAIR AT AUBURN
ASSASSIN CZOLGOSZ is beginning to show signs of weakening. When the
death sentence was imposed upon him at Buffalo yesterday the cowardly -anarchist
tremblingly whispered that he alone was responsible for the awful crime for which
he will be electrocuted during the week beginning October 28. When placed in
irons preparatory to being taken from the courtroom, the murderer displayed unmistakable
signs of fear. At night he was removed to the State Penitentiary at Auburn, where he will
pay the death penalty in the electric chair. â¢

- Finally, there is th- great canal across the isthmus
that is to open a short route from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. That of course stands far above all others
in magnitude, cost and importance. Taking all the
projects-. 'together it will* be seen; they 'constitute " an
amount of work that will employ the energies and the
surplus capital of the nations for a long time. The
last fifty years of the nineteenth century 'was essen
tially, an era of railroad, construction., Perhaps : this
is to be an era of -canal -building. l .
The feasibility of the canal- plan was discussed. at
a recent meeting of the Latin-American Scientific
Congress at Montevideo, and the facts brought out
are reported to have been so impressive it is believed
practical men will take up the enterprise and carry
it to completion.
The most extensive canal programme of the time,
however, is in South America. In that continent there
are three great river systemsâ the Amazon, the
Parana and the Orinocoâ all of 'them rising com
paratively near together. Surveys have disclosed the
fact that it. would not 'cost much to connect the
upper reaches of the three rivers' by canals available
for vessels of large size. It is said a passage less than
forty miles long would open a way from' the Upper
Amazon to the Parana, and thus provide an inland
waterway from Para to Buenos Ayres.

DEMAND FOR CANALS
FROM the number of canal projects now under
discussion in air parts of the civilized world,
from Russia to Brazil, it would seem that the
eafly part of the present century may become more
remarkable for canal extension than for anything
else. The railroad cannot supply all the needs of in
land commerce. Cheap waterways are in demand
everywhere.
â¢ Canada is projecting a canal from Georgian Bay
to the Ottawa, and hopes thereby to carry the trade
of the upper lakes through her territory, instead of
having it go to sea by- way' of New York. Chicago
wishes the Government to ; take her drainage canal
and convert it into a commercial canal of sufficient
depth to admit vessels to pass from Chicago to New
Orleans, and at the same :time she wishes a deep
water canal to the Atlantic. All along the Atlantic
coast from New York to Charleston there is an agi
tation in favor of constructing a series of inland
waterways which- would enable: a boat to make the
trip from one of those .cities to the other without
going to sea, and a further canal is demanded for a
route from Savannah to New Orleans, which would
obviate the long voyage around Florida. ' ; . \
Kaiser William has an elaborate system of canal
projects for the improvement of the commerce of
Prussia. The Czar's Government .is said to have de
cided to enter at once upon the construction of one
which will open a way from the Baltic Sea. to the
Arctic Ocean and thus provide Russia with an ave
nue to the Atlantic in case of war with some power
strong enough to close the Baltic to Russian fleets
and merchant vessels... The. French are discussing, a
great deep water canal from the Atlantic s to the
Mediterranean, so that French fleets and ships could
pass from the ocean, to the sea v without Â¦Â¦ having* to

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
So, too, with full graciousness and appropriate
ness, thousands of Democrats who voted against Mc-
Kinley and opposed his policies in war and in peace
may rightly contribute to his memorial. , Political
differences there must always be among us so long
as we remain a free and an intelligent people, and
political controversy dishonors neither one side nor
the other. When he entered upon his high office
McKinley ceased to be a Republican partisan and
became the representative of the whole people. Over
his grave there can be no partisan controversies or
even differences. With respect to his memory all
true Americans are now nothing else than Ameri
cans, and therefore all can with sincerity, with hon
esty and xvith patriotism unite in raising a monu
ment to him who so nobly served the State and fell
a martyr to anarchist hatred of its government.
From this universal Tight to take part in every
effort made to do honor to the dead there is excluded
bi;t one tiling that exists in America, and that is the
yellow press of W. R. Hearst. The public can neither
forget nor forgive the wrongs done to the dead by
the three lying papers in which Hearst day after day
for years assailed the President and inculcated in the
minds of the vicious the hatred that led to the crime
of Czolgosz. Hearst's coin must not be accepted.
TT-tc is blood on it, .
There has never before been a President whose
death has been followed by so many earnest demands
for a monument to commemorate his services and the
popular love of his fellow citizens. There is hardly
a State in the Union that has not some memorial
project under consideration. All classes of honest
citizens have united in these movements. In the
Northern States the men who were McKinley's com
rades in the war that saved the Union have been con
spicuous in promoting them, and in the South men
who wore the gray and who were his. foes on the field
of battle have taken the lead. No voice has been
more earnest, and hardly any more eloquent, in urg
ing contributions to a McKinley monument than has
been that of General Gordon, commander of the
Confederate Veterans. It is right that it should be
so. The 103'al people of the North will not grudge
nor misconstrue the subscriptions which McKinley's
jormer focmen of the Civil War may offer now to
commemorate his fame. All such contributions will
be but another evidence that the old divisions and
.animosities among the people have passed away, and
that the restored Union is a union of hearts and of
hands as well as of States.
There is no little gratification in having for this
once at least escaped from the affliction of the in
trusion cf yellow journalism, with its self-advertising
and self-enriching schemes into public sorrow.
Something more, however, is needed than the 'ab
stention of the yellow anarchists from their usual
faking in matters of this kind. Popular, sentiment de
mands that for rio monument or other memorial to
be erected to President McKinley should there be ac
cepted any aid from the yellow journals, or any sub
scription from them. Their coin should be refused
as emphaticallj r as their hypocritical grief is con
demned. Having derided, abused, vilified, maligned
and belied McKinley during his whole term of office
as President of the United States, they should not
now be permitted to insult his memory by contrib
uting to erect a monument over his grave.
piOR the first time in 'many .a year the people of
f-"< the' United States have fronted a great public
*Â¦ calamity without having their sorrow disturbed
by the clamor of the Examiner seeking to make
money out of the universal grief. Before the grave
of McKinley the yellow journal stands abashed. In
i2ce of the wrath of the public denouncing its vile
cartoons and vicious editorials it slinks away and
does not venture to come forth passing the hat for
nickels and announcing an "Examiner monument
fund," with a long array of ''commissioners" selected
to take charge of the "memorial which W. R. Hearst
is to raise as a tribute of the American people to the
illustrious dead."'
"He la a, man who ivould use the
country and its citizens for his o-trn

tender ones rotisH taxpayersâ the
rough riders to build up his fleht-
Iugt fame and the rough taxpayers
to foot the bills."
"He has said that his way of treating
those with whom he' disagreed politically
would be to 'stand a few of them up
against a wall and shoot them.'
"Roosevelt stands for a large perma
nent army and for using it against those
who should fail to agree with him.
"We do not ask the opinion of the citi
zen whose personal physical timidity
leads him to worship a magazine-made
hero. We ask the thoughtful menâ men
brave enough to do their own fighting if
cause should arise, men who do not hand
over their thinking or governing to a
magazine blusterer.
"How would you like Roosevelt In the
White House?
"If anything should happen to Mr. Mc-
Kinley the trusts would be quite content
to see Roosevelt in the White House.
"How would the average thinking citi
zen like that?
"The plan was to carry forward the
idea of changing the form of Government
now existing here â a form that now
makes trusts and their profits dependent
on an election, and is, therefore, insecure.
"Roosevelt was selected to run for Vice
President.
"Mr. McKinley, we must regret to say,
is a man of doubtful health. Much care
was used by the trusts and Hanna in se
lecting a man for the Vice Presidency
because of the fear that McKinley might
fail to live out his term.
ThÂ© following editorial which was pub
lished In the New Tork Evening 1 Journal
of September 8, 1900, under the caption of
"If McKinley Should Die After Re
election," reaches the climax of horror
In the crusade of the yellow newspapers
against the constituted authorities:
THE COIN OF THE YELLOW.
Demagogues at Work.
Bakersfleld Bally CaLifomlan.
The strike In San Franciuco would have
been settled long since but for the in
fluence of the Examiner, and settled
doubtless to the satisfaction of both par
ties to the controversy. The Examiner,
for Its own purpose, keeps alive the
germ of discontent, and when it feels
Its power waning It arranges for mass
meetings to be addressed by such dem
agogues as Peter Yorke. The body of
strikers Is anxious to return to work,
and with the Examiner and the agitators
out of the way the trouble would bo
speedily adjusted.
The presence of ex-President Cleveland
in Washington is not merely perfunctory.
It is personal tribute.
If we add to this that they Darted on
inauguration day with a distinct and
abiding esteem on Cleveland's part for
the moral quality and purposes of his
successor, we can also add something for
the other side. The intimate friends of
McKinley knew before he became a resi
dent of the White House that he had an
unconcealable admiration for the charac
ter and qualifies which distinguished his
predecessor. That the American people
would see some of these qualities pre
served in his own administration was one
of his hor>es, and became an aim.
There was a very friendly feeling, as
the Observer has the privilege of know
ing, between the dead President and the
living ex- President. There was something
more than courtesy between them in' the
hours that preceded the outgoing of
Cleveland and the incoming of McKinley
at the White House. Their conference
regarding unsettled public matters soon
to fall in the hands of President McKln
ley disclosed entire concurrence of view
and agreement of spirit.
Ex-President G rover Cleveland is In
Washington to attend the funeral of his
successor, the dead President. Yesterday
morning he telegraphed to General Wil
son accepting an invitation, and at 10
o'clock last night, with Colonel Daniel S.
Lamont and in Colonel Lamont's private
car, he left Princeton, arriving in Wash
ington this morning. "I shall participate."
he said before starting, "in any of the
exercises that may he deemed proper. It
is not my present intention to accompany
tho funeral party to Canton."

"IF McKINLEY SHOULD
DIE AFTER RE-ELECTION"
Among the Mourners.
And the rich man, even the trust ozvner, should be most deeply interested in applying
CONSERVATIVE REMEDIES BEFORE IT SHALL BE TOO LATE.
T F you vote for Hanna you vote for dangerous social conditions, for conditions dangerous even
J_ to the trust owners themselves, although they are too blind to see it.
This people will not submit to permanent exploitation of many by the few. That exploita
tion could now be crushed and gradually brought under control.
Let it go on for another four years and you will see conditions that will demand remedies
that Mr. Hanna never dreamed of in his wildest attacks on Bryan.
The people must decide, not between McKmley and Bryan, but between Bryan and CON
SERVATIVE REMEDIES NOW AND DESPERATE REMEDIES LATER.

JOURNAL THREATENED
THE ASSASSINATION OF
PRESIDENT M'KINLEY
If the people were not fools the trusts would learn a lesson at this coming election.
â¢ But, unfortunately, the people are fools yet NOT ENOUGH HAVE BEEN SHQT. THE
LIMIT HAS NOT BEEN REACHED,
r*TREET car conductors are good average American citizens. They are not anxious to be mur-
derers. If they are bad as a class, then the nation is bad. . . , â¢ vt \
A man, unless goaded to desperation, would not commit murder or risk hts life for
a few dollars.
But the trust owners have a bigger stake. It is millions of dollars with them. They are more
deeply interested.
And, besides, THE TRUST OWNERS NEVER GET SHOT. They hire professional shooters,
while they get out of town and carry on the war by wire.
A little girl was shot dead. A union man was killed by a bullet in the back. NO TRUST
MANAGER HAS EVER HAD A SCRATCH. THAI PERHAPS, ACCOUNTS FOR THEIR ARTI

What avail to answer or to argue with all this hullabaloo about "clubbing Ameri
can citizens into slavery," about "Bashi-Bazouks" riding down and robbing citizens with
"gray hair and venerable aspect"? Â¦ _-._.Â¦ Â¦ '.'Â¦.
The San Francisco public sees no reason for wasting argument on any one who is
jumping so wild as is the Rev. Father Peter C. Yorke.
The new Bombastes is in fact wilder than the old. He is like a man standing on
his head and kicking with both feet. He sees everything distorted, topsy turvy and up
side down. Within the range of his vision "nothing is like it used to be," and nothing i is
like it ought to be. The only ways by which he can ever be made happy again are by
reversing himself, or by revolutionizing the world; and he prefers revolution.
has the kind of brains that are going to -make him the laughing stock of his enemies. '.
In fact Father Yorke is evidently suffering from a â¢ species of madness which
leads him to believe it to be his duty to fight the whole community. He berates lustily
nearly everything in sight. All who are rich, all who are at work, all who. oppose vio
lence, all who are sane and reasonable, all who publish the truth or who accept it when
published, and in fact !all who are not on a strike or kicking, are regarded by Father
Yorke as his foes; and like Bombastes Furioso hanging his boots at the cross roads,' he
virtually issues the defiance to the world: ;
"Whoever dar'es these boots displace
Must meet Bombastes face to face;
Thus do I challenge all the human race."
the passions and prejudices of the community have been aroused, the city is peaceful. If
there has been violence it has come from the hirelings of the Employers' Association, and
from the mercenary police whom the rich men have subtracted from the impartiality
of the law.
When the city was absolutely peaceful this malodorous society captured the police
force and has since used them as provocatives to crime.
Before I close let me say one word on the general question of violence. I HAVE
WARNED THE MEN AGAINST IT, BUT I AM BEGINNING TO CAST IN MY MIND IF THERE
BE NOT WORSE THINGS THAN VIOLENCE. Violence is to be reprobated when the law
protects you, BUT IF THE LAW IS PERVERTED,
â¢ WHAT THEN? .
The action of the police in this city, especially within the past few days, has been
intolerable. I have seen an old man with gray hair and of venerable aspect ridden down
and clubbed by one of Sullivan's Bashi-Bazouks. Every hour peaceable citizens are held
up, searched, robbed, assaulted, and there appears to be no remedy. Never in Russia did
the police act as they are acting to-day on the water front of San Francisco and in
our streets., ' . %
People of California, what is done to-day to the longshoremen may be done to
you to-morrow.
WAGE -EARNERS OF SAN FRANCISCO, WILL YOU STAND BY AND SEE YOUR
BRETHREN CLUBBED INTO SUBMISSION TO THE EMPLOYERS' ASSOCIATION? The
object of this violence is not to keep the peace, but to compel the men to return to service.
When the strike leaders protested to Mayor Phelan, what was his answer? Listen to it,
ye freemen: "If they don't want to be clubbed, let them go to work."
As of old the refractory slaves were lashed into obedience, so now American citi
zens in San Francisco are to be clubbed into slavery.
HOW LONG WILL YE STAND IT, YE WAGE-EARNERS OF SAN FRANCISCO?
IT IS YOUR FIGHT. i
The police that terrorize the sailors to-day will terrorize the clerks, the mechanics,
to-morrow. IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO THINK! And as for me, if the responsibility of giving
advice should again be put upon me, I. should consider long and earnestly if there aremot
worse things than violence, AND IF THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION DOES NOT CALL US
TO PRESERVE OUR LIBERTIES EVEN AT A SACRIFICE.
What serious reply is to be made to all that? What man would undertake to
argue against it in view of Solomon's double warning against, answering, a fool accord
ing to his folly, and also against answering him not according to his folly?
If the Rev. Father Yorke sincerely believes that his statements are true then he
WHEN the Rev. Father Peter C. Yorke entered the arena of strife to take
part in the controversy between the strikers and the business men of San
Francisco, The Call, recognizing his past eminence as an orator and his official
position in the pastorate of the city, deemed his utterances worthy of. seri-.
pus consideration. Accordingly his speech at Metropolitan Hall was not only fully re
ported, but the salient points in it were later on given the dignity of further publication
in parallel columns with the utterances of Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop Riordan and
Archbishop Ireland on the same subject. Since that time the Rev. Father Yorke has en
tered further into the controversy by contributing a series of letters to the Examiner. In
these letters he has gone beyond the reach of serious consideration. To publish what he
has written for the Examiner in contrast with the words and the counsel of Cardinal
Gibbons, Archbishop Riordan and Archbishop Ireland would be to reduce argument to
an" absurdity. The Rev. Father Yorke in fact has kicked over the traces of reason; he is
out of reach of comparison with any one else, and is to be judged by no other standard
than his own* ...
' Human history is full of instances of men of ill balanced minds who after achiev
ing a marked reputation in the community have become infatuated with 'their triumph,
and in their efforts to live up to it have given the world another illustration of that
vaulting ambition which as Shakespeare says "o'erkaps itself and falls on t'other side."
In his present efforts to be eloquent . Father Yorke screams; in his struggle to be inspir
ing he grows wild; and in his desire to make points he misses truth, argument and
philosophy and comes nowhere in measurable distance of that at which he aims.
What serious treatment is, due to such utterances as .these taken from Father
Yorke's article published in the Examiner of yesterday? ; .. *

While the fires on the island of Hawaii
are still raging, a new one having been
started by a careless native apiarist in
smoking out bees, news Is made public
about an Immense Irrigation scheme that
has been before the Government for some
months. It is a private enterprise, the
inauguration of which promises not only
to prevent all fear of drought In the two
districts of Hamakua and Kohala, but to
reduce the danger from forest fires. The
plan is to construct vast reservoirs for
Impounding the water and a system of
conduits for conveying It to the agricul
tural Iand9 In the districts of Hamakua
and Kohala. There is a watershed In the
mountains designed to be occupied by the
Irrigation plant, which is estimated to as
sure a yleid of twenty billions of gallons
a year. All this water is now running to
waste Into the ocean along the rocky
coast lying for many miles between the
two districts that have the present sea
son suffered untold loss from drought and
fire. Colonel Jones, commanding the Ha
waiian National Guard, represents Chi
cago capitalists who are prepared to make
an expenditure of $2,500,000 for the con
struction of the plant.
HONOLULU, Sept. 17.â There is a grow

Samuel Parker, both bound for Wash
ington. Copper Is ostensibly going to de
liver personally Into the hands of the
Secretary of the Interior his official re
port of the affairs of the. Territory for
the past year. At the same time it is
known that Cooper is being backed for
the position of Governor. The Home
Rulers at a caucus have nominated Dele
gate Wilcox.
Parker will only say that he Is going
to Washington primarily on private busi
ness, but that he will as before be pre
pared to answer any questions relating to
Hawaii, including the Governorship while
there. At this writing it does not appear
that the local Republican organization
has Interested itself in the matter.

Mrs. J. Xewton Bailey has not been
charged with the murder of her husband,
who died "Wednesday afternoon from the
effects of revolver wounds, and probably
never will be, as the police are Inclined
to believe that her statement to the ef
fect that her husband first fired a shot at
her and then Phot himself is correct. She
stated that she was standing at the end
of the dining-room when he tired the shot
at her, and yesterday Detectives Whit
aker and MoMahon, who have been de
tailed on the case, discovered the bullet
on th? floor. Its location bears out her
statement.
"1 believe that the woman has told a
straight story,' said Captain Seymour
yesterday, "and the finding of the bullet
to-day confirms my belief that her hus
band tried to kill her and then Â£hot him
self. She has not .jeen charged and I
don't think she ever will be. We will wait
till it is seen v;hat will be the result of
the inquest."
No one except Mrs. Bailey saw the shots
fired. Mrs. Charles Gardner, sister of
Mrs. Bailey, says that she had left the
house before Bailey took out his revolver.
The only point against Mrs. Bailey is the
statement of Dr. Lewis H. Allen to the
police to the effect that she told him on
his arrival at the home, 132 Duncan street,
that she had shot her husband. She said
yesterday that Dr. Allen is mistaken.
What she did say to him was that her
husband bad forgiven her for what she
had said and done, meaning the part she
had played in the quarrel that preceded
the shooting. She vehemently denies that
she fired the shot -that killed her hus
band, and feels keenly the suspicion cast
upon her. She was visited yesterday by
several of her. relatives and friends.

tire fleet will have to round the Horn, so
the Yankee clipper and British ships will
have a chance to try conclusions over
that much of the course.
The blockade of the grain fleet has been
broken and a fleet of seven vessels will
bo on Its way East and to Europe by
Saturday morning. The British ships Cel
tic Monarch and King Edward, fully load
ed and manned, pot away yesterday,
while the Dovenby, Mooltan. Glenesslin.
Koyledale and the American ship William
JK Babcock will sail to-morrow morning.
J tie latter vessel carries barley for New
"York, but the others are all loaded vritii
wheat for Europe.
There are several bets made on the out
come of the run to Europe. Captain
frltcnerd of the Glene.Â«=slln has wagered
a new suit of clothes with Captain New
map c f the Kinp Edward that his ship
will be home first In spite of the two
days" start which the King Edward has.
The captains of the Dovenby, Mooltan,
Glenesslin and Foyledale have agreed to
purchase the best pair of marine glasses
: in England for the captain of the win
ning ship.

PHILADELPHIA. Sept. 26.â Cresceua.
the king of trotters, to-day failed to lower
his record of 2:02#. made at Columbus,
Ohio. August 2. in a trial on the Belmont
Driving Club course at Narlmrth, a sub
urb of this city. The great son of Robert
McGregor stepped the mile in 2'MVi. with
out a skip, and thereby reduced the track
record of 2:08%, made by Alir.. on Novem
ber 7. 1894.
Everything was conducive to nne time.
The track was lightning fa3t and thera
was not enough breeze to interfere with
the progress of the great tro.ter.
There were nearly 8000 people present
when Owner Ketcham brought Cresceua
on the track for his first jog. He wanned
Z? in the stretch for a tew minutes and
then Jogged around the track in 2.31^.
After a rubbing down Cresceus was
brought out for his preliminary triaL

breaking. After scoring once Ketcham
gave the starter the nod an a the trotter
was off, paced by a runner attached to a
S *When the first quarter was reached in
:3<Hi everybody thought the record would
surely be broken. The second quarter on
the straight backstretch was made In 30&
seconds, but the third was a fraction of a
second slower. Turning into the home
stretch Ketcham urged the trotting ma
chine to his utmost, but the best he couid
do was :2\V-> for the quarter. As the horse
flashed under the wire a great shout went
up from the crowd, which immediately
swarmed around the horse and owner.
Ketcham had no excuse to offer for the
failure to break the record, saying the
track and weather were favcrable.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Sept. 26.â The
Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York
received their first welcome to the West
at Winnipeg to-day. They arrived at
noon 'and remained for ten yours. The
next stop on the tour will be to-morrow
at Regina. Thousands of visitors from
tne prairie towns gathered for participa
tion in the reception here and the streets
were filled with cheering crowds when the
party , arrived. All the local militia and
police, the regulars quartered here and
several civic societies were formed about
the station.' The Duke and -Duchess were
welcomed by Premier Laurier and the
Countess of Minto, Lieutenant Governor
McMillan, Premier Roblin, Mayor Arbuth

i Captain Patterson reports that he did
not see anything of the steamer Nome
City, which sailed from Dutch Harbor,
September 17, for Nome with disabled ma
chinery, but thinks she will reach her des
tination all right, as . the . weather was
good.
News comes from Dutch Harbor to the
effect that the killing of seals on St. Paul
and St. George Islands has : caused the
seals to look for new quarters. A Japa
nese schooner found a new rookery. In the
Aleutian group on an island called Doul
dyr and made a raid on it, killing. most of
the seals. Probably over 2500 carcasses
were found there >by^ Captain Peterson^ of
the schooner Challenger, 'who reported It
Sick and indigent people at. Nome have
reached such large numbers that the
question of what shall be done with them
is the main topic. This year there is no
Government transport on which they can
be sent south, as was the case last year,
and the outlook for them is exceedingly
gloomy. The hospitals are taxed to their
utmost capacity and ' the sick and dis
tressed are clamoring for admission. Just
before the Senator sailed a mass meeting
was to be called for the purpose of raising
money to send that class out on the last
boat.
The largest nugget ever found in the
no'rth was taken out of Anvil" Creek Sep
tember 14. - It weighs ninety-seven ounces
and is valued at $1552. A rich strike â¢ Is
reported on the head of Grouse Gulch.
The pay streak is seventy-nve feet deep
and of unknown extent. The claim was
bonded for $50,000 and the bond had lapsed
but a few days before the strike was
made.
The Senator sailed from Nome Septem
ber 16. Out of a large number of passen
gers on the Senator not one of them,
brought out as much money as they took
with them. All speak in high terms of the
country as a mining section, but say that
the laws are such that it will be years
before the country will open up. , They
say that' not one new claim, has been
opened in the vicinity of Nome this seasbn
for the reason that when prospectors flnd
pay diggings some one comes along and
claims it by right of prior location, and
it Is then tied up in court.
PORT TOTVNSEND, Wash., Sept. 26.â
The ' steamship Senator arrived from
Nome to-day bringing nearly 500 passen
gers and over $500,000 in treasure. The
Senator experienced good weather until
a point 200 miles off the Vancouver, coast,
when she encountered a terrific gale
which lasted several hours. A minor ac

while repairs were being made the steam

STORM SHAKES
GOLDEN CARGO
Dixon weighed in at 121 pounds and
Yanger at 124. The second and concluding
rounds were the best of the fight. In
the former they came together without'
any preliminary fiddling and played a
merry tattoo on each other's ribs. Dixon
was compelled to break ground frequent
ly. In the last round Yanger rushed Dix
on, administering terrific punishment on
the body. The latter was game and gave
flashes of his former prowess by counter
ing heavily, but each time he was forced
to break ground as the Chicago boy bore
in. This round was decidedly in Yanger's
favor. Dixon showed well In the eighth.
Toward the end of the round he nailed
Yanger in one corner of the ring and
planted every blow known In the fighting
category upon him. #
George Slier acted as referee.
Dixon Escapes a Knockout.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 26.â Benny Yanger of

In its last time at bat Los Angeles
scored . two more and for a time looked
like making it a tie. Hemphill's hit to
right scored Spies and Dougherty.
The same teams will meet again this aft
ernoon at 3 o'clock. It is expected they
will have recovered from their nervous
ness and will play faster ball. The score:
Dougherty scored the next run in the
seventh for Los Angeles. He hit to cen
ter, made second on Nordyke's fumble and
scored on Shay's wild throw to first to
catch Hemphill.
Los Angeles sent two men over in the
fourth, chiefly through errors by the In
fielders. Kihm was safe on first owing to
a fumble by the shortstop. He reached
third on a wild throw of C. Reilly's hit
and scored on Wilson's fumble at the
plate of an infield hit. Dougherty fol
lowed with a hit to second, scoring Reilly.
The run-getting commenced in the third.
Wilson for San Francisco reached first on
a hit to pitcher, who fumbled the ball.
Hildebrand hit to deep right field. The
ball was again fumbled. Wilson scoring,
and Hildebrand reaching third. Schwartz
was put out on a fly to left. Hildebrand
beat the ball home a fraction of a second
and scored. Dougherty made a sensational
one-handed catch of Pabst's hit to right,
retiring the side.
San Francisco scored three more in the
fourth, Los Angeles suffering from an
attack of the "rattles." The outfielders
dropped several files which seemed sure
outs. Two more in the fifth completed the
list of runs for the locals.
Los Angeles played Altrock, the Cana
dian, in the pitcher's box, with McPart
lln, Jones. Hale and Hartwell in reserve.
Los Angeles was flr^t at bat and made a
good start. Hemphill and Householder
each lined the ball out for singles, but the
side was retired without a run.
Many baseball enthusiasts went to Rec
reation Park yesterday to see the reju
venated team from Los Angeles and de
termine, if possible, what chance the men
from the south have of wresting the pen
nant from. the San Franciscos. The mat
ter Is still an enigma. Uncle Henry's men
won by a score of 7 to 5 after a game re
plete with excitement and errors. In the
latter the southerners had a shade the
better of the locals, rolling up a total of
eight to seven for the opposing side.
Ban Francisco 7, I*os Angeles 5.
Pittsburg Still Continues to
Play in "Winning
Form.
Remaining Contests of v the
Series Expected to Be
Exciting.
As the men are to fight at catch weights
they have done only light work during the
past two days. Neither has had a set
back in his training and will have no ex
cuses to offer on that score. -
George Harding, who is an authority on
pugilism, figures Gardner a legitimate fa
vorite. He defeated Moffatt and Carter,
showing great improvement in the latter
fight. Walcott lost to Carter last winter.
Says Harding: "Gardner is the coming
man. He is equally clever with either
hand. He hits hard and never gets con
fused. He is always cool and will not
take a chance of getting hurt, preferring
to await his opportunity. I look for him
to defeat Walcott."
The betting last night was still done
with the odds at 10 to 8, Gardner ruling
favorite. There was more Walcott money
m sight, however, than Gardner money. In
what wagering was done at Zeke Abrams'
in the paris mutuels Gardner had a slight
lead. He was chiefly in demand to win
in from 6 to 10 rounds or that he would
get the decision if the bout went the full
twenty rounds.
Opposed to him to-night is the man
whose standing among boxers authorities
on the game have been unable to fix.
Some of the best men that ever pulled on
a glove have declined the issue with him
â they think they can find easier oppo
nents. Tom O'Rourke offered 'Sharkey a
bonus of foOOO if he would agree to meet
Walcott in a 20-round bout. The Sailor
was then in his prime, but he could not
be dragged into meeting the sawed-off
colored man.
Although fighters are not popularly sup
posed to be cast in a gentle mold, Gard
ner is the exception. He lives a quiet life,
out of the ring, and is a religious man.
He is a church-goer ,N attending services
regularly.
That he is ambitious is evidenced by a
remark he dropped some weeks since. He
boxed at a benefit at which Jeffries and
Ruhlin also appeared. Some one remarked
upon his being nearly as tall as Jeffries
and that he ought to be fighting the big
heavy-weights. Gardner suprlsed those
present by. saying quietly: "I'll fight the
heavy-weights. I bar no man."
Both men have fought some wonderful
ring battles and are recognized as being
among the best of the middle-weight di
vision. Gardner is pronounced on all sides
one of the cleverest men that ever entered
a ring. He is said to have improved great
ly in speed and endurance- since coming
to this coast. If Â¦ Walcott does not take
down his number to-night there are few
men of his weight who stand between him
and the world's championship.

TACOMA, Sept. 26.â Nome advices say
that\an effort will be made to enlist Gov
ernment aid in the dredging of a harbor
for Nome. Engineers who have given the
subject considerable attention express
the opinon that with a couple of million
dollars a harbor could be made commen
surate with the shipping importance of
Nome. Others who have examined the
plan think it impracticable.
, According to one plan prepared it is in
tended to have a channel fronting Nome
10,000 feet long, 600 feet wide and thirty
feet deep: At either end there would be
an approach channel thirty feet deep, 400
feet wide and, 5000 . feet long. This work
can- be accomplished by a system of hy
draulic dredge mining. This idea is to
permit of a line of docks immediately in*
front of Nome so -that the largest vessels
in any kind of weather could, run into a
port of safety. There would be timber
and rock core constructed twenty feet
wide,, with.* embankments made from
dredgings.

CARNIVAL OF NATIONS.
Who Shot in Self-Defense.
The case of Raymond. Morris, a boy 15
years of age, charged with assault to
murder, was heard before Judge Fritz
yesterday and dismissed. The evidence
showed that the boy, who is employed on
the steamer Eureka, was walking along
the Vallejo-street wharf to the vessel on
the morning of September 23, when he was
approached by Jens Peter Sorenson, a
union sailor picket, who caught him by
the arm and asked him where he was go
ing. The boy told him, and Sorensen said,
'â¢\ou are, are you?" .Just then another
striker approached, and the boy becoming
alarmed pulled a small revolver out of his
pocket and fired a shot, the bullet strik
ing the lapel of Sorensen's coat and
longing in his sweater. v
The Judge, in dismissing the case, said:
"The only question in my mind is
whether or not the defendant acted In
self-deiense. The defendant was very
candid and frank in his statement and
was evidently idling the truth as to what
happened on the wharf, and it does not
conflict with the testimonv for the people.
The question is whether "the words 'You
are, are you?' and the grasp of the com
plaining witness were sufficient to incite
fear. There is also another fact, and that
Is that another picket was approaching
the steamer landing and was then only
about four yards away. If the defendant
were a full-grown man instead of a boy
,of 15 I think I should hold him. Of course
I think, in view of the present excite
ment and the boy knowing that he was
engaged in what is commonly termed
â¢scabbing,' that he had a just and season
able fear that he was about -to be at
tacked, the words, 'You are, are you?'
seem to imply a threat as much as to say,
'I will see whether you are or not.' I am
glad that no serious damage was done,
because to my mind the picket did not in
tend to use violence. But I have to take
the mind of the defendant in this case*
what he thought and whether he believed
himself to be in danger from the appear
ances, even though the appearances -be
false. Owing to this and the further fact
that the defendant is only 15 years of age
I decline to hold him to answer to- the
charge." '.-â¢â¢.
Judge Fritz Refuses to Hold Boy
RAYMOND MORRIS DISMISSED.
Bo Took, the Chinese woman who was
shot early yesterday morning by a re
jected suitor while she was seated in the

supposed slayer, was subsequently taken
into custody by Detective Ed Gibson and
locked up irt the tanks pending an investi
gation. The woman wa3 one of the belles

wife. She spurned his offer and threat
ened to have him arrested unless he de
sisted in paying attention to her. Yes
terday morning the discarded suitor, so
the police say, opened fire at her while
she was seated in her home, four oi the
bullets taking effect in- her left breast.

After leaving Portland Hoyt 'Â¦ came to
this city and received an engagement with
Kohler & Chase as outside salesman, w:.th
the result mentioned. The firm is deter
mined to prosecute him. The police also
say that he has swindled Letson Balliet,
civil engineer, 508 California street.
Hoyt's parents live in Danbury, Conn.
He disappeared from, home on April 8,
1899. He was then 17 years of age, but
looked 19. He apparently went to the
Stats of "Washington and was married in
Olympia to a young ladjr belonging to
Chehalis. They went to live with Lucius
H. Leech, Superintendent of Schools at
Chehalis, and it is alleged that he
swind-'ed Leech out of -money and IÂ»ft
with his young wife. He made his appear
ance In. Portland under the name of L. 'C.
Miller and represented himself as an
agent for Kohler & Chase of this city.
He passed a number of worthless checks
and was arrested, but as he paid up Iho
amounts and $83 which he owed a hotel
keeper he was not prosecuted.
The firm of Kohler & Chase secured, a
warrant a few days ago for Hoyt's arrÂ« st.
He was employed by them about seven
weeks ago as an outside salesman. HÂ©
was a smooth talker and an accomplished
pianist. He disappeared about a week
ago with his wife and the. firm discovered
that he had sold a piano to Max Galli;k,
auctioneer, Market street, and had re
ceived money, a gold watch ajid same
clothing in payment, and then left the
city. It is also alleged that he had been
collecting considerable money and appro
priating it to his own use.

mond Frederic Hoyt, alias L. C. Miller,
had been arrested there, and the caj>tiin

necessary papers for his extradition, as
he is wanted here on a charge of felcny
embezzlement.
Work along the water front has resumed
its normal condition and vessels are load
ings and discharging, goods being hauled
to and from the docks with facility and
dispatch. The vigorous action of the po
lice has reduced the interference with the
work of the port to a minimum. The men
that came forward in the emergency are
becoming more useful every day, and, as
none of the labor in voluntary idleness
could -be classed as "skilled" the exist
ence of the strike will soon be more a
matter of discussion in the councils of the
City Front Federation than a factor in
the commercial machinery of the port.
The BritWh ships Celtic Monarch and
King Edward sailed yesterday with full
cargoes of grain, and to-day and to-mor
row the following fleet, similarly laden,
will get under way: The Mooltan, Do
venby, Foyledale, Glenesslin and W. F.
Babcock. The work of discharging the
other British ships in port is going on as
if no strike existed, and the few passen
ger coasting steamers that were com
pelled for a. while to sail at-irregular in
tervals have now resumed their regular
schedules. *

The market for wheat was a dull and nar
row affair. A ring of local bears attempted to
force December under 70c by taking advantage
of the favorable reports from Argentina and
Russia, but the movement lacked sufficient

corn and light Southwest receipts. December
opened at 70%c. sold to 70%(gi70%c. reacted to

Weather Report.
â¢'Hois were r.carly all picked before the
rain becan. In last week's report it was
etaud that the hop yield was below expec
taticRi- and that it would not be more th-iu
one-fourth as much as last year. This waÂ«
an error and should have been one-fourth
less than last year. The returns received
this v.-eek lead to the belief that the Oregon
hop yield will be a little less than thrt-e
fourths of as large a crop as that gathered
lat-t year.
"Corn and potatoes are being harvested and
the yields are light. The third crop of alfalfa
has beÂ«-n cut and housed. Pastures have been
much improved by tho rains and stock is gain
ing flesh.
â¢Prune picking is well advanced and a large
porticn of the crop was secured before the
rairiF Ixgan. A fair crop of apples, pears
and peaches are being marketed."
"Good rains fell in all parts of ths State
on the L'lst and 23d. In the Willamette Val
ley and coast districts they averaged about
2.tO inches in depth, while in the eastern
portion of the State they amounted to less
than an Inch. These ralr.s will do great good
in reviving pastures, in softening up the soil
for lull plowing and in putting out forest
f.r^s and clearing the air of smoke. They
wili. however, delay the prune harvest and
If tliey continue much longer will prove to bs
lniuricus to that crop.

Mention has already been made in The Call
Produce Prices This Year and Last
ket in London had made a slump. London
poured out stocks upon the New York market
in liquidation, making the opening active anil
weak. It became evident very quickly that
support was to be accorded to Amalgamate!
Copper and Anaconda. Only 700 shares of the
former and 600 shares of the latter sold at
% below last night's closing. All subsequent
transactions were at or above last night's
level. Both Btocks fluctuated frequently dur
ing the day, but the large short interest
showed Itself nervous over the rally 9fter
such a steady decline. The active demand
from the shorts caused Amalgamated Copper
to recover more than the day's loss and It
closed only % below the best. Anaconda is
% higher for the day. The severe liquidation
in some of the railroad stocks, which was s
feature yesterday, was not In evidence and
the fears felt of unfavorable developments in
the companies not yet known to the public
were relieved. The selling was explained as
being due to liquidation by bull pools, and
suggestions were heard of internal dissensions
between the members of the pools to account
for the liquidation. The announcement of the
arrival in San Francisco of a consignment of
f2.;.OO,CC0 In Australian cold, taken in connec
tion with yesterday's report of a shipment of
a like amount from Sydney and the large re
ceipts of Klondike gold -in the last few days,
served as a reassurance to those who ten un
easiness ever the future money outlook. The
market closed quiet and steady at about the
best.
The principal weak spots In the bond mar
ket were in speculative Issues. These rallied
with stocks and others were firm throughout.
Total pales, par value, $2,090. COO.
United States bonds were, all unchanged on
the last call. .

VICTORIA. B. C. Sept. 26,-When the
inquiry into the Islander wreck was re
sumed to-day Ii. Puddicombe of Tacoma,
a passenger, stated that from the appear
ance of the pilot he had formed the
impression that he was under the influ
ence of liquor.
Chief Officer Neroutsos was put through
a strong examination by Mr. Bodwell for
the Attorney General's department. Ho
denied that Captain Leblanc, the pilot,
was intoxicated. He was with him on the
bridge from 7:45 p. in. to 8:15. The steam
er Karallon passed, and the witness asked
If he should blow the passing whistle, the
pilot replying, "Oh, no: she'll clear." The
witness thougMt the steamer was going u
little close. There was nothing to give
the witness the impression that the pilot's
condition was such as to make him reck-
Iish. He naid he certainly was not un
der the influence of liquor.
The second officer, who had bren on the
bridge with the. pilot, nwore that the pilot
lmd not been drinking; at \r&Â»t he could
not notice liquor on htm. Tho evidence
of the bart^ndfr was to the effect that
the captain had but onÂ«* drink at the bar
on thÂ«Â» night cf the accident. Two bottlCD
of flcntch whisky w<*nt to the saloon for

He told his audience that Charles M.

Schwab called the attention of Lawrence
to the fact that his steel workers got

A mechanic gets the best {

Why shouldn't a woman ? j
The best household tool j
known is Fels-Naptha soap.
With it the drudgery of j
clothes-washing and house-
cleaning is not half as much
as usual, because there's no ;
boiling. â¢ |
If upon thorough trial of

the herring are so plentiful in Maine. I
have never seen such a rush in the sar
dine factories in Eastport as there is at
the present time. More herring are being
caught than can be handled at the fac
tories, and It is impossible for the steam
ers to take the sardines to Boston as
rapidly as they are prepared. Some of
the factories at Eastport are receiving
1000 hogsheads of herring a day and most
of them are working day and night to try
and keep up with the rush.â Lewiston

that the acts of Congress to prohibit the com

McKinley cannot be arrested in its

Courageous as a soldier, supreme as a states

ory in his radiant life, President McKinley

We.' the committee on platform and resolu

city and county of San Francisco September
16, 1901, herewith submit the following plat
form and resolutions as our unanimous report,
and recommend, the adoption of the same by
the convention. â¢ > Â¦
â¢The reason I signed that report was that I
thought it was -a -matter that should be sub
mitted to the convention. I was a member of
that committee and. opposed the motion as pre
sented by the chairman of the committee on
order ! of business, that the chairman Â¦ of the
convention Â¦ should ' appoint the County Com
mitteemen at large. I thought It was a mat
ter for the district Â¦ entirely, and furthermore
there were only twelve members present and
voted on motion. The- recorded vote was seven
for and five against. There being this division
In the committee I thought It but fair that
the -matter should be submitted to the conven
tion:^
Kelly had" just ceased talking, when one
of the delegates "seated in the rear of the
hall required the " assistance of Â¦ a couple
of police officers to prevent him from dis
rupting the meeting.' A number of dele
gates who followed spoke in favor of the
minority report. - Further debate . Â¦was
closed by moving the previous question.
On the call of the* roll the vote stood:
For the minority report, 86; against the
report, 271. The majority report was then
adopted by an almost unanimous vote.
General R. H. "Warfleld presented the
following as the report of the committee
on platform" and resolutions: g
Chairman Riordan ordered the call of
the roll, but Marc Anthony of the Thirty
ninth and A. M. Currie of the Thirty
eighth districts took the floor in favor of
the minority report. Martin Kelly fol
lowed, speaking as follows:

Samuel Hill MoCfett. master of the Chil
ian steamer Tucapel, was arrested yester
day on complaint of Immigrant Inspector
Schel! for having unlawfully landed an
alien immigrant on June 30 of this year.
On that date the steamer arrived from
Valparaiso with a stowaway on board,
and Captain Schell served a written no
tice upon the purser not to allow the
stowaway to come ashore without per
mission of the Immigration Bureau. In
6plte of this official warning the stowaway
escaped. Captain Moffett explained that,
being on board a foreign vessel in a
United States port, he did not think that
he had authority to put a stowaway in
irons or to imprison him on the steamer.
Captain Moffett was released on a $500
bond. â¢

Calls Convention to Order.
There is still talk of another candidate,
wnose identity is not disclosed to the pub
lic. This is said to account for the unan
imity with which the delegates voted for
adjournment. The Forty-first District
delegates are still firm in their purpose to
place the name of C. A. Murdock before
the convention as their choice for Mayor.
The Herrin and Burns forces are so
formidable in the convention that the In
dependents, desiring the nomination of
special favorites, are swinging toward the
railroad for help. It was common talk
last night that the railroad delegations,
combined with available independents,
could execute a programme of nomina
tions. . The question is, "Will the pro
gramme be changed and some other as
pirant than Wells be slated for Mayor?"
It was observed by the politicians that
the platform indorsed the national ad
ministration, but had no word of commen
dation for the State administration of
Governor Gage. It is Just possible that
General Warfield and his associates de
liberately gave Gage the overlook."
Insiae intelligence is to the effect that
Herrin, Burns and Goldberg have not
fully determined to put Auditor Wells for
ward for Mayor.
A motion to , adjourn the convention
until next Monday evening was not re
sisted by either the Wells or Laumelster
forces. Many delegates expressed the
opinion that a ballot last night would
have resulted in the nomination of Asa
R. "Wells for Mayor. ! Many of Wells' sup
porters seemed surprised that advantage
was not taken of Kelly's defeat in his
efforts to deprive Chairman Thomas D.
Riordan of the power to appoint eighteen
County Committeemen at large.
tested the fact that Boss Mar
tin Kelly could not rally more than
eighty-six votes to the' support of a propo
sition emanating from a minority of the
committee on order of business. The Pri
mary League delegations in the conven
tion voted almost solidly against Kelly's
measure. The five Grand Hotel delegates
were lost somehow in the shuffle.

W. J. Wynn suggested that the unions
be requested to furnish the names of all
members and that appeals to them to do
missionary work be at once sent out. It
is expected in this way to enlist about
20,000 union men in the cause.
The question of finance was quickly set
tled. As each candidate is allowed to ex
pend 10 per cent of his first year's salary,
it was decided that 30 per cent of this
amount should at once be placed at the
disposal of the executive committee, fur
nishing a working capital of more than
$1600.
Chairman Millmore announced the ap
pointment of J. T. Nenahy, John Mont
gomery. John Brown, P. H. Kelly and D.
A- Desmond as a purity committee.
A joint meeting of the candidates recent
ly nominated by the Union Labor party
and the executive campaign committee
was held yesterday afternoon at Native
Sons' Hall to discuss ways and means of
conducting the coming municipal cam
paign. There was a large attendance, Jo
seph Millmore, chairman of the late con
vention, presiding. Eugene E. Schultz,
nominee for Mayor, outlined the reasons
for the meeting.
Many ideas were advanced as to the best
course to be followed. The committee was
authorized to procure central headquar
ters and open them at once. As soon as
possible clubs will be organized in each
Assembly district, and at least two mass
meetings will be held in each one. Metro

rally on the night preceding the election.
Missionary work for those districts
wherein the majority of employers reside

Regarding tte accident Bibber said:
"My wife and 1 came over from Oakland
to attend the show at the Orpheum.
Pierce, who is an old friend, boarded the
car and I was :n the act of shaking hands
with him when we were run into by the
Ellis street car. The motorman of the lat
ter car failed to give any warning of our
ganger, notwithstanding that he must
have known that the accident was inevi
table. My wife escaped being seriously
injured by jumping to one side when the
cars came together."
Delaney boarded the car at Third street,
and when near Stockton he handed the
conductor 50 cents.
"I was waiting for my change," he said
when giving hit. version of the accident,
"when suddenly the Ellis street car
crashed into the one on which I was rid
ing. My legs were pinioned against the
etep of the car, and for a time I thought
it was all off with me. Just then a num
ber of men pulled the Ellis street car
back, thus freeing my legs. As I started
to step off the car I fell, my ankles re
fusing to support my body.. Some police
men picked me up and carried me into the
drugstore. I am positive that the motor
man of the Ellis street car did not ring
the bell or give any warning cry. In my
opinion the accident was due to criminal
carelessness on the part of the motor
man."
The Ellis street car, which was badly
damaged, was thrown off the track by the
collision.
A few seconds after the accident hap
pened Police Officers Beach, Mulcahey,
i3riscoll and Sylvester appeared on the
scene and carried the injured to the drug
store at Market and Stockton streets.
Bibber and his wife soon recovered and
left for their home in Oakland. . Delaney
and Pierce were sent later to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where their injuries were at
tended to.
Bibber and Pierce were shaking hands
when the collision occurred. The former
was cut about the right arm and was
generally bruised about the body. Pierce
had his ankle dislocated and his face cut
by flying glass. Delaney was standing at
Pierce's side. He was caught between the
cars and had both ankles broken.
Car 569 of the Ellis street line crashed
into west-bound Halght-strcet car 15*5 at
Market and Fourth streets last night, in
juring four passengers. The wounded are
Thomas Bibber and wife, who reside in
Oakland; Howard Pierce, an agent for
the National cash register, and J. M. De
laney. a marine engineer, who lives at
651% Howard street.- The injured were all
passengers on the Halght street car.
It was a few minutes after 8 o'clock
when the accident occurred. The Ellis
street car had reached the junction of
Stockton and Market streets and was pro
ceeding across the latter when it crashed
into the Haight street car, which was
crowded at the time. That none of the
passengers were fatally injured is miracu
lous. Standing on the step of , the dummy
at the time were Bibber and Pierce, who
are old friends. Mrs. Bibber occupied a
seat near them.
. Chairman Rlordan ruled the resolutions
out of order, on the ground that the mat
ter should be referred to the committee on
platform and resolutions. - -â¢
Leon Samuels of the Twenty-ninth Dis
trict moved that the convention adjourn
until Monday plght. At 9:10 p. m. the
motion was carried, the convention being
In session for less than an hour.

the part of the Employers' Association to yield
these differences to arbitration.
Whereas. The Employers' Association has re
fused to yield the differences between them

Before the report was adopted J. B.
Sykes of the Fortieth District offered the
following resolution: a . .
The salient points of the committee's re
port, particularly those referring â¢ to the
late ' President McKinley, the erection of
new school houses and the curbing, of the
extravagant salary list of the Board of
Public Works, were loudly applauded. ! Â¦
Salient Points Applauded.

â¢ We favor civil service for all departments of
the municipal government, and its enforce

We favor the ownership by the city of such
public utilities as i are imperatively necessary
for the common good. ,
We earnestly recommend that Immediate
steps be taken for the purpose of securing in
creased protection for the residents of the city

advocate the adoption of the recommendations

partment of the city and county in his reports
of January and February of this year.
We recommend the immediate abolition of
all cobblestone pavements upon the business
streets of- this city and that the same should
be replaced with modern pavements construct
ed in the most substantial manner, and the
adoption of a systematic plan for the abolition
of cobblestone pavements in other portions of

will permit, and we hereby pledge our nom

constructed of either brick or stone, for tho
purpose of providing adequate accommodation
for all the school children of this city.
Secretary Ingram, who has been the
closest man to President Hays here, will
go East with him. Ingram, being a man
of great personal magnetism, has estab
lished himself as a universal favorite in
club circles during his short stay here.
With the departure of Hays for the
East Chief Counsel W. P. Herrin's star
will be in the ascendency. He will in teh
future be looked upon as the power be
hind the throne. Though Harriman will
send a president out here as chief execu
tive, this president will have, to make his
reports to J. C. Stubbs, traffic director of
the Harriman system of railroads. Herrin
will be allowed to manipulate politics as
he sees fit, ani woe betide the president
who comes out here in the future and an
nounces that "the road must keep out of
Herrin's Star Ascends.
During President Hays' brief adminis
tration he has made many friends. He is
looked upon as a man of great executive
ability, with a strong sense of justice and
easy to approach. His resignation was
handed in to Harriman owing to the
strong personal dislike evinced to him by
many of the railroad officials, who still
stand loyal to the Huntington interests.
These officials would not take commands
from President Hays, but on every possi
ble excuse telegraphed to H. E. Hunting
ton and asked him to intercede and have
orders revoked that had been made by
Hays and were distasteful to them. Hays
became tired of this constant interference
with his work, and going to New York
handed in his resignation, which was
later accepted by Harriman.
It is more than possible that with the
severance of Hays' connection with the
Southern Pacific Company Julius Krutt
schnitt, general manager, will also resign.
Whether J. M. Herbert will continue as
manager in ' Fillmore's position is also a
conjecture.
Officials Ignore Hays.
President Hays informed all the heads
of departments In the early part of this
week that he would sever his connection
with the Southern Pacific Company on
October 1, and the officials are now busily
putting their, heads together and forming
combinations so as to hold their positions
more securely. . . .
What President Hays intends doing: or
what road he will identify himself with
is not known. He is a man that keeps his
own counsel and unbosoms himself to no
one. It Is conjectured that he will leave
for the East the early part of next week,
and his family will soon follow him. Who
will ! succeed him as president of the
Southern - Pacific Company he says he
does not know â at least he claims that
Harriman has not informed him. It' is,
however, generally conceded that S. M.
Felton of the Chicago and Alton road will
fill the position.
Charles M. Hays, Â¦' president of the
Southern Pacific Company, severs his con
nection with the corporation on October 1.
All the heads of departments have been
notified by Mr. Hays that he leaves the
company on that date, and the official cir
cular . announcing . his resignation was
hourly expected â¢ yesterday afternoon
around the yellow building.:
