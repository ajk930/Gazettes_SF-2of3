SENATOR M. A. HANNA, WHO .
HAS BEEN HONORED BY G.
A. R. COMRADES.
:hat It was always a source of regret to
iim that he could not have served long
The One Hundred and Fiftieth Regiment was
organized at Cleveland May 5, 1S64, to serve 100
days. After being eworn into service it was
immediately placed on cars for Washington
City. On its arrival the regiment was ordsred
to srarrlsoi ' t'orta Lincoln. Saratoga, Thayer,
Bunker Hill, Slocum, Totten and Stevens,
forming part of the chain of fortifications sur
rounding- the national capital. The regiment
remained in these forts during t'.e .whole term
of service and participated in the fight before
Washington, with a part of Early's rebel
corps, July 10 and 11. 1S64. Companies G and K
were engaged, but belnsr behind breastworks
did not suffer much. One man was killed and
three or four wounded. The regiment was sent
home and mustered out at Cleveland August 23,
ISM, havins served 111 days. Â¦ Â¦
The record which Hanna's regiment
made is given in the official history as
follows:
enough in the war to entitle him to wear
the bronze badge of the G. A. R., which
he considered the highest medal of honor.
Rassieur questioned . the Senator and
learned that Hanna had enlisted in the
One Hundred and Fiftieth Ohio Volunteer
Infantry, which was mustered in for 100
<3aye in 1S64 to guard Washington. This
ptrlod of service was sufficient to make
him eligible for membership and Rassieur
easily persuaded Hanna to join the order.
To Leo Rassieur. Commander-in-chief of
the Grand Army of the Republic, belongs
the honor of being the first to discover
Comrade Hanna. They were talking one
day in Washington of the Grand Army en
campment, which is to be held in Cleve
lanc" next. September, when the Senator in
a burst of confidence told Rassieur that
he was a soldier fcr a short while and
That Hanna's enlistment remained a se
cret for thirty-six years, his veteran
friends say, Is a high tr*bute to the Sen
ator's modesty. Hanna's explanation is
that he didn't think his services in the war
â¢were important enougti to entitle him to
wear a Grand Array badge or to make
much fuss about it.
It was not generally known until recent
ly that Marcus A. Hanna was a veteran of
the Civil War. The record, however, shows
that he enlisted at the age of 26 and was a
second lieutenant.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 6.âSen
ator M. A. Hanna has been ap
pointed a colonel on the official
staff of General Rassieur, com
mander-in-chlef of the Grand
Army of the Republic. Senator Hanna

Army of the Republic as a member of

Austin Chamberlain explained that It
was imperative that the cable -should; be

to-day says: W. K. yanderbllt has been
asked to accept election Â¦ to the Northern
Pacific board; of directors under the re
construction which is, now under way; in
accordance with the agreement between
the Union Pacific interests and J. J. Hill.
This left the selection of the Northern
Pacific board to J. P. Morgan, but it is
likely that all the names will be agreed
to â¢ by the , time he reaches this country.
Mr. Vanderbllt has not given his accept
ance of election to the -Northern Pacific
board, so fac as could be learned to-day.
If he declines, H. McK. Twombley will
be asked to go into the board. Both Mr.
vanderbilt and Mr,- Twombley are direc
tors of the Chicago and \ Northwestern.
Their election to the Northern Pacific
board will not, however, indicate an,in
terest of the Northwestern In the North
ern Pacific stocks so much as a desire to
operate that property in the interest of
harmony among the -Western < railways.
The other new names to be. selected for
the new Northern Pacific board will rep
resent just as, broad-minded purposes as
would Mr. Vanderbllt or Mr. Twombley. .

Machinist Strike Justified.
On general principles Tayler thought a
difceussion of the tariff at this time would
be unwise and undesirable. He did not
consider trusts the outgrowth of protecr
tion, but conceded that incidentally some
trusts might be benefited by protection,
"just as the sun may cause weeds to
crow."
Speaking of the strike of the machinists
Gunton said It was perfectly right, as he
believed that labor was justified in organ
izing a capital for the protection of its
Interests. He said, however, that the ma
chinists were blameworthy. In that they
had agreed to arbitrate and then had
failed to live up to their agreement. He
favored compulsory education and a law
limiting the hours of labor. Referring to
Atkinson. Gunton said that his views
were all born of theory and that when the
opinion got abroad that theories akin to
Atkinson's were about to be enacted Into
law there came near being general bank
ruptcy.
Tayler announced himself as opposed to
the principle involved in trusts because,
he said, he considers human nature too
v.eak to entrust In a few people such a
power as is involved in trusts. He
thought abuses were certain and that the
result would be what he called Gover
rnental socialism or Governmental owner
ship of articles controlled by the trusts.
"Do you ' know of any combine that
actua controls any Industry?" Clarke
cfked.
Tavler said that he did not.
"Is not the United States Steel Corpor
ation on the border of obtaining absolute
control?" asked Colonel Livingston.
"1 cannot answer that question either
yes or no." replied the witness, "but there
are many large iron and steel concerns
not in the combine. Iron ore and. coal
are widely distributed, and I do not be
lieve that any one will ever get absolute
control of them."
Tayler said that, distrustful as he was
of the trusts, he had no remedy to sug
.gest. He did not accept the theory that
the trusts alone could be trusted to re
duce the cost of commodities. Instanc
ing the United States Steel Corporation,
he said that its securities amounted to
fl.500,000,000, while the cost had not been
one- third that amount. He had no doubt
that the holders of these securities would
demand returns upon them. He said he
â¢would oppose the Babcock bill placing iron
products on the free list, because the re
sult would be to destroy independent ef
fort, while It would not especially injure
the trusts, as with them the only effect
could be to reduce labor.
Abuses Certain to Follow Trusts.
WASHINGTON. June 6.â The Industrial
Commission at its cession to-day consid
ered the tariff question with incidental
reference to trusts, the witnesses being
Congressmen Robert W. Tayler of Ohio
and George Gunton, president of the New
York Institute of Social Economics. Tay
ler took the position that any discussion
in Congress of the tariff at this time
would have a damaging effect upon the
country- He said the DIngley law was
the most equitable tariff law the United
States had ever had. He took a decided
j>oeitjon against trusts and said they were
not fostered by â¢ the protective tariff.
Tayer also said that he believed in the i
principles of recinrocity but that he did
not indorse any "of the recently negoti-
Eted reciprocity treaties.
Gunton devoted himself especially to re
plying to an argument recently made be
fore the commission by Edward Atkin
sou for freer trade. Gunton said that the
freedom contended for by the opponents
of the tariff is analogous to the freedom
of the savage, a fieedom which if in
dulged in too freely not only brings In
jury but ruin to himself.
Upholds the Dingley Law.
Tayler announced the general principle
that the histcry of this country for the
past few years and the conditions demand
that there should 'not be the slightest re
laxing of the tariff principle as now em
bodied In the Dingley law. The relation of
the tariff to trusts, he said, is only in
cidental. The Dingley law embodies, he
said, the idea that American civiliza
tion is on a higher plane than any other
and requires a higher reward for its
labor to maintain that excellence. When
ever the labor cost is greater than else
where It Is necessary that there should
be un equalizing influence such as the
Dingley law. Primarily,^ therefore, the
protective tariff law was in the interest
of labor. Even the farmer, he said, gets
a reciorocal benefit; â¢
"How Is the farmer benefited by the
tariff on steel T' asked Colonel Living
ston.
"In the first place." replied the witness,
"there Is not much . tariff . on steel and
Iron, except possibly on tin plate. We pay
out In wages not less than $20,000,000. That
means that the consuming power of the
American people at home is increased to
that extent, and I think that. the effect of
that increased consumption is sufficient to
recoup the farmer for any supposed In
crease of the cost to him of iron and steel
articles which he may purchase."

"Yes," said .Yerkes when interviewed to
night, "we have : practically got control
of the Underground' Railway. That is

although far the largest portion of the
capital comes from the United States. We
hope to begin, work .in a few months, as
the consent of Parliament has been ob
tained.
'The system we intend to Install is al
most exactly similar to that in use on
the elevated lines in Chicago. We will
sell the present antiquated cars and sub
stitute others of an American pattern. We
intend to rebuild the stations, to install
arc lights. and to make the road equal to
any rapid transit line in the world.
"Yes, we must have American engineers
to do the work. They know nothing about
that sort of thing here. I tell you what is
the trouble with the English concerns is
1 that they do not know the value of a
scrap heap. As to the agitation over the
United States buying up England it Is
i absurd. Years, ago British .capital con
; trolled' the bulk of the American railroads.
Since then Great Britain has been on the
decline and the United States has pro-
Kcessed. As a natural result the circum
stances are now reversed. '
English. Company Now Satisfied.
"When I first proposed to take over the
Underground Railway the English com
pany raised all sorts of objections, but
gradually they came around and they ap
pear to be perfectly satisfied with the
bargain.
"No, I cannot say who are in with me.
However, I wish to assert distinctly that
the report that the Widener-Elkins group
is in any way connected with the syndi
cate is absolutely untrue. I intend to re
main here for a considerable time, as
there are likely to be several things need-
Ing my personal attention." . ,
After declining to say whether he con
"templated buying up other roads, Mr.
Yerkes concluded with a declaration that
the remodeled Underground Railway
would be far superior to the existing Lon
don "tube." .
"The people who built that," said he,
"krew nothing except how to dig holes.
Everything else is wrong. - Chicago is
ahead of the rest of the world in electric
traction. If they had studied the Chicago
system they might have given London
bomethring better. In the course of time

tors of the board of the Underground

LONDON, June 6.â A special meeting of
the District Railway to-day sanctioned
Charles T. Terkes" plan for the introduc
tion of electricity as the motive power of
the road. J. S. Forbes, the president, said
the work would occupy two years.
The agreement with Yerkes provided
for the formation of an electric traction
company to electrify the road. Mr. Yerkes,
Â¦who represented sixteen of the most
influential firms, bankers and capitalists,
was ready to stake Â£1,000,000 to help the
railroad relieve its position. The syndi
cate had already bought shares to the
value of Â£1,250.000 and was ready to buy as
many more. It had to construct a gener
ating station at Chelsea, make the neces
sary alterations in the permanent way
and construct fresh rolling stock. - Half a
million of ordinary stock paid to the Trac
tion Company was taken at the nominal
price of Â£25, and Â£166,000 was taken in 4
per cent debentures at par. Five per cent
interest was to be paid the Americans on
the outlay. A syndicate of 'bankers had
undertaken to put up Â£1,000,000 as security
for carrying out the contract.

WASHINGTON. June 6.â In view of the
several representations made In Havana
regarding the interpretation by the Sec
retary of War to the Cuban commission
ers of the Platt amendment, It can be
stated authoritatively that the Secretary,
did not deviate from the declaration that
the President and himself had no power
to change an act of Congress. It is said
here that the amendi&ents which the Cu
ban convention made to the Platt law
and the incorporation of conversations
with Secretary Root did not represent his
views of the amendment, nor was he cor
rectly quoted in the alleged statement.;
Among the reports given out in Havana
is the translation of a letter of Senator
Platt, written to the Secretary of War,
furnished as a confidential document to
the Cuban commissioners when , they
Â¦were here. This letter briefly gives the
views of .the Connecticut Senator on
some features of the law which bears his
name. Surprise was expressed that the
letter should appear in print In Havana-
General Wood telegraphed the depart
ment to-day inquiring as to the where
abouts of the letter of Secretary Root
explaining in detail the objections to the
actions of the constitutional convention.
It Is understood that the letter will reach
Havana within a very short time. It has

Melting Snow on J.tho High Sierra I
' Peaks Forms Many New . '
Waterfalls.
YOSEMITE, June 6.â The warm weather
has started the melting of the snow in the
high Sierras surrounding the Yosemite
Valley." Due to this fact the falls In the
valley are more full of water than they
have been for years. Hundreds of new
cascades come tumbling^ down the moun
tain sides in torrents, making new streams
to the Merced River. The floor of the val
ley now resembles one. huge lake. â¢
This Is considered the most unusual sea
son ever experienced .in the Yosemite on
account of the peculiarities existing at
such a late period. The abundance of
water has always been at-its height not
later than the middle of â¢ May and from
this time on the falls begin to dwindle.
The 'late season this year is attributed to
the severe winter and, the long cold spell
during April and May holding back the
melting of the snow. The warm weather '
has i brought the foliage out abundantly.
All the trails to the principal points of in
terest are now open and more snow than
has ever been known to exist in the high
Sierras can be seen from the various
peaks around the valley. .'.Hundreds of
tourists have taken the Glacier Point trail
and from the summit one can see j miles
of snow-capped peaks.
The campers are beginning to crowd into
the valley. Most of the grounds assigned
to the campers are well* filled. From
many letters received the guardian ex
pects to have about. 2000 campers here. .:

Coach Off a Perilous

Frightened Horses Carry the
VANCOUVER. B. C, June 6.â Runaway
horses carried a mail stage coach down
the face of a mountain precipice early
this morning near Greenwood and as a
result of the accident one man was killed
instantly while two other men and one
woman are not expected to live. The ac
cident occurred to Alexander Haugh's
coach, the victims being Andrew Kirk
land, driver, killed; Mrs. Edward Benard,
arm and leg broken, fatally injured;
Harry Xicholls, fatally injured internally,
and Charles Leyland, leg broken and ribs
crushed. The other two men, whose
names could not be obtained, were
knocked unconscious by the fall down the
slide, but were only bruised and were able
to walk in- to Greenwood.
The disaster occurred before 5 o'clock,
a. mile after the passing of the Half-Way
House between McKinney. a mining camp,
and Greenwood in the Boundary Creek j
section. Ten minutes after leaving the '
Half-Way House the horses were scared
by some animal on the trail. They dashed
away and were going down the grade at
a rapid rate before Kirkland could get
them under control. By that time the
heavy coach had attained such a. momen
tum that it was impossible to stop. The
road was narrow and rocky and washed
into deep holes by recent rains. Some of
the passengers tried to jump out, but that
would probably have meant death against
the side of the deep-cut road.
According to the survivors Kirkland
cried out for them all to keep their seats,
that he would get safely to the bottom.
I'nder the great strain some part of the
harness broke, else they would probably
have safely passed the dangerous curve,
but the horses took a fresh start with the
breaking harness snapping against their
flanks. At the point where the stage
went over one can drop a pebble 250 feet
on the brink of Jolly Creek below. The
side of the cliff above the road is a face
of rock another hundred feet up. The
road is very narrow at best, and with the
wild disorder of the runaway horses there
was not a chance of averting disaster.
When an hour later another stage came
along the work of rescue was quickly ac
complished. The horses were found un
derneath the broken wagon and the two
men who were least Injured were lying
twenty feet to one side, where they had
been thrown and rendered unconscious.
The injured people were taken to Green
wood Hospital. Kirkland' s body was
taken back to McKinney. where his fam
ily lives. Both horses were dead when
the rescue party arrived.
Some of the trails are;almost impassable
for even pack animals. â¢ . "What gold is sent

run more regularly. '.However, there will

Special Dispatch to The CalL
; FRESNO. June 6.â Owing: to a discrep
ancy inthe new charter the city of Fres
no seems destined to be without any
government for at least three weeks.
The charter provides that the newly
elected officers shall take their positions
on the 17th of June- â¢ Another section,
however, provides that the charter it
self shall not go into effect until â¢ the
8th of July. .
City Attorney Lannlng says that the
officers serving at present under. the old
charter will lose their positions as soon
as the new officers qualify, which will
be on June 17. The new officers cannot.
however, serve under the old charter,
and are powerless to act until July 8,
when the new charter . goes into effect.
The old â¢ charter will continue in power,
but there will be eo officers to adminis
ter the laws. Several of Fresno's law
yers are , trying to untangle the legal
mudd le. .Â¦.</âÂ¦ " ; . - "

SANTA BARBARA, 1 June 6.â Miss !
Naomi -Wheelan of I this city and her '
brother, F. H. Wheelari, are about to come
into an inheritance of $1,000,000 r.througn
the expiration of some j German Â¦Â¦. govern- '
ment. bonds.; The. story v is Â¦; at ! orice fas- â¢
cinating and romantic. r It is not along- one '
on the part of the heirs, of the wealth,
but it dates as far back as the middle of ''
the eighteenth century.,.. *, ..' ;
In 1746 Count Von Sitler,' a wealthy and
influential - German,; became- - dissatisfied
with his two sons on account of their re-,
llgious belief. The Count was a devout :
Catholic and the fact that the boys be
came converts to the doctrines of Luther â¢
was sufficient to cause him to invest his
fortune, in German Government bonds
payau.e at the expiration of ninety-nine ,
years. At the end of that. time the prin- '
cipal and its . accumulations were i to. ..be
divided equally among the lineal descend
ants of the two sons. . . â¢ , : - <V Â¦Â¦'.
The expiration of the term' occurred In
1845. The German Government immediate
ly instituted search for the scattered
heirs, for their name seemed to be legion :
when' the records began -to "be searched.
Not until recently had, all the heirs be
come known. There are 200 of them. The
Count's fortufie has accumulated 1 by in
terest on thejbonds to amount, to" $201), 000,
000, an even million for each heir,
- The connection by which' Miss "Wheelan '
claims right to a share- of the great
wealth is through her mother's side of the
house. A daughter of 6ne of "the Protes
tant sons was the great -grandmother of
Miss Wheelan' s mother.' making- - Mrs.
Wheelan one of the 200 heirs. Mrs.
Wheelan is now dead, but her husband,
son and daughter survive her. Just when 1
the final distribution of the Count's wealth
will be determined is not settled,' but it
is exnected that it will occur before the_
end of the coming "year. Miss Wheelan
has lived here for several years. :

SUPREME COURT DECIDES
AGAINST MOffEY LENDER
J. Boas Purchases City Salary War
rants Which Prove to Be Gold
; . Bricks.
J. Boas, the iCearny-street money lend
er, can collect nothing from the city
treasurer on salary warrants which he
cashe-1 last June. Such was the decision
given by the Supreme Court yesterday.
Boas failed to persuade Treasurer
Brooks that he should be paid $6307 50,
which was the amount called for on the
salary -jvarrants which he possessed. He
then applied to the courts for satisfac
tion but. his plea was not allowed. A
lengthy petition- brimming- with leg-al lore
was presented to the Supreme Court and
yesterday it was returned, with the brief
but portentous statement, "Writ denied."
It Is alleged that Boas purchased the
warrants for 50 cents on the dollar and
had he been successful In the collection
of them his profit would have been am
ple payment for hip accommodation, but
there is a law to the effect that one
year's debts of the city carmot be paid
out cf the appropriation for another year
and' on that rock the hopes of Boas were
wrecked.
The petition stated that the St. Mary's
Park appropriation of $125,000 could be
utilized in this way, but the Justices de
cided otherwise, and now apparently no
recourse Is left to the money lender but
to avoid such mistakes In the , future.
Fair Will Contest Dismissed.
Judge Troutt made an order . yesterday
dismissing the contest instituted by
Charles L. Fair to the will of his father,
the late James G. Fair. The petition of
Flc-rson & Mitchell for attorney fees for
services rendered on behalf of the execu
tors of decedent's will was taken under
advisement The petition for fees was
opposed by Reuben H. Lloyd and ex-Gov
ernor Budd. both stating- that the demand
lor fees should be included in., the final
account, passed upon by the executors
and later by the court. Judge Troutt said
th;it he would take the petition under ad
visement and announce his decision later.

THE favorites were buried beneath
the Â¦ deep sea yesterday on the
Oakland race course and ' long
shots touted and untouted rolled
, in to satisfy a f ew \bettors and
warm the hearts of the slate rubbers. The
game opened with the smoothiiome-coin-
Irig of Harry 'Thatcher at lengthy odds.
This was followed up by other outsiders
and for a time It looked as if the favorites
would find a pasture in the Infield..
Harry Thatcher, as good as 23 to 1 onvthe
slates, was none too gentle a surprise in
the first race. #It was all Ping from" one
end of the ring to the other,, but Ping did
not figure in the race, the show being the
best that Stuart could get on this favorite.
Thatcher, Armstrong up, took the lead
early in the race and never lost it. Rainier,
Hazard astride, another long shot, cap
tured the place. Novia and Hohenlohe,
two other favored ones, < strolled in for
nothing. . - . * ..-;Â¦Â¦
Sylvan Lass at 10 to 15 Prior doing the
steering, ambled in in the second race
over one mile and fifty yards. Mamie Hil
dreth, favorite at 7-5, , finished sixth in a
field of seven. Lass darted out after the
first turn and was never headed, First
Shot working up from fifth to the place on
the stretch. Burdoc finished third, but
Wa3 disqualified for Interfering and Kas
talne was given the show. Â¦
Cousin Carrie, at all prices In the ring
from 15-1 to 10-1, was touted as the winner
in the third number on the â¢ programme,
the live furlong event. Until the stretch
; was reached Cousin was a popular mem
ber of the family, but then Maresa and
Catherine Bravo shot out, drawing Hom
age, the favorite, with them. Homage,
Armstrong up, won the first honors at the
wire, Catherine Bravo coming In for the
place and Maresa the show.
Huachuca and Sndwberry were equal
choices for â¢ the five furlong race for 2
year-olds and both finished within the
money, but neither took the purse. . That
was left for Divina, on whom the books
gave odds, as good as 15 to 1. Coming, up
like the wind Divina just beat out
Huachuca, who was ridden poorly. /
Gaylon Brown, Fauntleroy up; Gusto,
piloted by Guiterrez, and Mike Rice with
Armstrong in the saddle, started a fast
clip up the bafck stretch in the fifth race,
Hoar on Princess Titania* the favorite,
holding back until Well in the stretch.
When. the Princess passed the. bunch and
won out, Gaylon Brown getting the place
and Gusto, on whom there was some play,
the show. . " v
Spike, 4% to 1, rolled in for the purse and
first money in the last race^ Soon after
the first turn â the race was /over one and,
a sixteenth milesâ Sur.ello, in no con
dition to race, fell, throwing Guiterrez
against the fence. Then they all strung
out, Spike going to an untouchable front.'
The procession ended: Spike, first; Pat
Morrissey second and Sriips, the. favorite,
third. Guiterrez was carried to the hos
pital and remained unconscious for some
time. The doctors said last night that he
i would be all right on the morrow. *

checked the victorious career of Sacra
mento to-day ' and won the game by a
score of 5 to 1. Stanley was crippled with
a bad thumb and White, was given , his

a' good game, but his muff of Reitz's foul,
a passed ball and' his wild throw, to. third
let in five runs and lost the game which
should have been ltd nothing In favor
of Sacramento. The features of the game
were Bowman's work in left, Reit? at
second and Brockhoff's running catch of
McLaughlin's long hit, that would have
been good for a home run. The game

Gentle, Zephyrs Play Havoc
'With the Ball and
Spectators.
Uncle Henry's aggregation won in a
cloud of dust" yesterday tat Recreation
Park. The wind blew the diamond Into
the grandstand and but for the benches
the players might have finished the game
among , the spectators. An elongated
young man named Tyler; who halls from
the South, umpired the came and judging
from the kicks . made at his decisions he
must have caught considerable of the
flying dust' in his eyes. .
The Dutchmen won their game in one
inning. It was in the second that they
rolled up the six runs that gave them a
victory. Cal Bwing's buncn of Dudes be-;
came afflicted with stage fright and be
fore the agony Was over six "Germans
crossed the rubber. The locals started out
auspiciously by getting three men on
bases. A double play, however, spoiled
their opportunity and they had to wait
until the next inning. In the second three
hits, four errors and a base on balls did
the trick. Six runs were scored and the
young man who pulls the bell tired of his
Job before he finished stroking the metal.
Oakland settled down after the dis
astrous inning and . played good ball.
Time and again they had men on bases,
but failed. to do anything rash. Four runs
were all they, could score and these tal
lies were made with hard effort.
Babbit^ pitched a good game, but his
support was ragged. Moore tried hard to
play circus with the ball and he almost
succeeded. His juggling of the sphere
would have won hhn applause In a vaude
ville house, but only gained him jeere from
the spectators at the game. The zephyrs
played havoc with the ball. A high fly
would be carried out of reach and the un
fortunate fielder could only retrieve It.
Streib hurt his finger near the close of
the game and Mr. Decker of the old world
was put in to guard the initial sack.
Decker forgot his "Charley-horse" and
played good ball. Evans pitched an in
different game. At times he seemed to
possess speed, but ofter.er he would, ease
up and the Oakland batters would land on
the ball for keeps. Mr. Evans was non
plused by Cal Ewing's protests. against
his style of pitching. Ewlng claimed that
Evans put both feet forward at once and
to mollify the manager Evans anchored
one foot in the box. Following is the

National Sporting Club Is
Granted Permit for
August
The Police Committee- of the Board of
Supervisors decided yesterday that the
San Francisco Athletic Club would have
to change the date of Its boxing exhibi
tion which has been scheduled for July
4. Ihe committee decided that If the
club does not agree to change the date
before next Monday's meeting of the
board its license will be revoked.
Reed opposed this action, contending
that as the" club had already made ar
rangements for its exhibition on Inde
pendence day It should not be disturbed.
Stafford, however,' spoke strongly against
allowing the day to be disgraced by fistic
contests.
""We cannot afford to demean ourselves
before the community by being a party
to the desecration of a day that is dear
to every true American," said Stafford.
Tobin agreed with Stafford, and the in
hibition against fighting on July 4 was
extended to Include amateur clubs.
The National Sporting Club was grant
ed a permit for a boxing exhibition In
August. The applications of the Twen
tieth Century Athletic Club and the San
Francisco Athletic Club to give contests
In September went over for one mqnth.
Reed and Stafford are in favor of giving
the permit to the first named club, as un
der the rotation rule it Is entitled to ths
privilege. Reed, however, favors the San
Francisco Athletic Club, because It came
later in the fistic field. Manager Gleason
was informed that he could go ahead
with his negotiations for September, pro
viding the exhibition of the Twentieth
Century Club fully complies with the or
dinances.

very valuable cargo and quite a number
of passengers. Among those who went
away on her were W. A. Rodenberg,
Civil Service Commissioner, and A. R.
Serven. who are bound for Honolulu, and
J. C. McMullin and L. G. Young, who are
ijoing to Manila to inspect the location
for the- proposed breakwater. The. Pe
king's full list of cabin passengers was:
For Honoluluâ S. T. Alexander, Mrs. E. JÂ»
Cotton. E. G. l>uisenberg, Charles Green, Ren
ton Hind. Miss Marie Lutz. Mrs. W. H. Mays.
"W. A. Rodenberg. Captain C. Ryder. A. R.

About an hour after the Peking got
away the Chinese and Japanese and Fili
pinos who came over on her and had
been removed to the detention shed got
into a free fight. There was nearly a riot
for a few minutes and one Chinese nearly
lost an ear. The watchman clubbed the
Mongolians into quietness.

Talcahuano. South America, for Welling

this same ship started from Port Pirie,
West Australia, for the port she is now
bound for. Strange to say, she was
caught in a tempest and was driven clear
across the Pacific, finally bringing up at
Talca-huano. She made the run back in
about 40 days, but on this occasion seems
to be having bad luck.

Peking 1 Sails for China.
Henry Hart, an A. B. on the battleship
Iowa, committed suicide "Wednesday
night by swallowing a large dose of car
bolic acid. The reasons for the rash act
are unknown as the young man was a
favorite with the officers and crew and
seemed to have no troubles. Hart joined
the Iowa at New York as an ordinary
seaman, but being active and willing
was soon rated as an A. B. Wednesday
evening when it came to cleaning up
quarters he could not be faund. and it
was thought he had overstayed his leave.
When the men. at 7:30 o'clock, went to
sling their hammocks for the night, they
found Hart dead in the center of a pile
of the canvas beds. His mouth and chin
were terribly burned with the acid and
he seemed to have died in great agony.
A coffin was procured from the army
transport wharf and the remains were
pent to Mare Island on the torpedo boat
Karragnt.
Hart was engaged to a young lady in
New York, and his relatives all live in
that city.
One of the Crew Kills Himself "With
Carbolic Acid-
THE old vhallng bark Lydla Is go
ing to the bone-yard in a few
days to be broken up. She has
been dismantled and as no one
seems to want the hull it proba
bly will be burned for the sake of the
copper bolts that are in it. The Lydia was
built in Massachusetts sixty years ago,
and is now as tight as the day she was
launched. For weeks she has lain at the
Howard-street bulkhead, and during that
time not a drop of water has leaked
through her seams.
The Massachusetts boat builders of
three or four generations ago seem to
have had the knack of putting together
long lived vessels. The schooner Polly,
Etlil In commission at Calais, Me., and
commanded by McFarland, was built at
Amesbury, Mass., in 1S05. The American
register gives her burden as 45 tons net.
and her dimensions as 61 feet 4 Inches
long, 13 feet beam and 6 feet 3 inches
deep. Not a very big boat as vessels go
nowadays, yet in 1S12 the Polly was ply
ing her trade as a privateer and made
Quite a number of captures. Finally she
herself was taken by a British sloop-of
war, and the captain and crew were
taken to England. The prize crew put
aboard the Polly seized the vessel and
carried her into Boston harbor.
In 1S49 the Polly came around the Horn
â¢with a party of gold hunters. She lay
in San Francisco Bay for nearly a year,
and then went back East. Since then she
has circumnavigated the globe a number
of times and her master says that on her
one hundredth birthday she will still be
as sound as a dollar.
The old Lydia would not now be going
to the bone-yard if there was anything
for her to do. She is only fit for whaling,
however, and the steamers have driven
the wind-jammers out of that business,
so the bark will be broken up unless

BIVAIL TJNDEBTAXERS WAR
OVER MAN'S DEAD BODY
"I heard the boys' cries," said Mr.
Frankenberg, "and ran to see if it was
my boy. I found him all right, and then
went back and saw a black object re
sembling a man struggling in the water.
I saw a man answering the description
given by the boys as we came on the
boat." ' t
Mr. Johnson of the McCulloch substan
tiates the statement of Frankenberg.
The spot where the boys say the man
jumped over the rail was about 1000 yards
from the Sausalito landing and in smooth
water. Captain Johnson says his deck
hand failed to notify him of the occur
rence and consequently he was powerles3
to act.
The cries of the boys brought a number
of. the passengers from inside of the low
er cabin to the scene, among them A. J.
Frankenberg, 324 Clay street, and J. John
son of the United States revenue cutter
McCulloch, who claim to have seen the
man floating in the water. A moment or
two â¢ after the accident a boat from the
McCulloch was ' sent in the direction of
the spot where the children allege that
the man jumped.
According to , the elder lad's statement
he and his brother were on the . after
deck. One lad was near to the capstan on
the port side and the other near the spot
from which the man. jumped. 1 In describ
ing the situation he said:
"The man climbed up on top of this,"
touching the removable rail, "caught hoM
of this pole and then jumped right out
into the water. He wore light checked
trousers, a darker coat and vest and a
round black hat." He did not' say any
thing when he went over."
"That is just what he did," said Leo,
the younger. "He just climbed up there
and jumped. He had on light ! pants and
a round hat."
"I guess we will have to lower a boat,'!
remarked the deckhand,, who went for
ward and was not seen again. . ; â¢
An unknown man is reported to hav%
jumped 'oft the after ,. starboard rail of
the steamer Sausalito on her 4:15 p. m.
trip from Sausalito yesterday: The only
witnesses to the attempt at suicide are
Charles and Leo Fisher, lads aged about
eight and six years, respectively. They
notified a deckhand, and passengers who
were in the after part of the lower cabin,
attracted by their cries, claim, to have
seen a dark object floating in the water
some distance astern. . .

British Government to the Hay- Pauncefote treaty as
amended by the~Senate is that while it authorizes the
United States to fortify the canal it requires " Great
Britain to guarantee its neutrality; and if the lan
guage be subject to any such, construction by dip
lomatists it would seem that Salisbury has certainly
a right to kick.
To the rest of the busy country it is merely a row
in the morgue between two fellows who are suspected
of knowing how the corpse came to be a corpse, and
each is abusing the oilier! But of what interest is it?
The country is glad the corpse is. on the slab, and
doesn't care which one made it a corpse.
This vision of blood rises red on the sight of the
Kentucky Major, but does not move the Nebraska
Colonel out of his tracks. The two gentlemen are of
less importance than the energy of their wordy quar
rel indicates they think they are.
The Major then lapses into history, abuses Cleve
land, and fears that the extremism of Colonel Bryan
"will prove our undoing if 'ever we are undone;
forcing into existence artificial " classes; arraying
these one against the other; the bigotry of ignorance,
the intolerance of hate, their presiding dieties; all
wisdom and patriotism drowned out by the brute
force of numbers on one side, Ihe roar of cannon on
the other. Mr. Bryan seems to me the archangel of
extremism of the present time as Mr. Yancey was
forty years ago. If his dominancy is to continue he
will lead the Democratic party, and maybe the coun
try, where Mr. Yancey led them.'\ â¢
Whereupon Major Watterson lays down his hand
and rejoins: "There you 'have it flat. This would
bar all revision, even all discussion. But Mr. Bryan
must be obeyed. Must a great party, three years in
advance of its next national convention, suspend all
effort to strengthen its lines, deny itself any and
every opportunity to take advantage of such circum
stances as may come to it, and submit itself unre
servedly and absolutely to the word as it issues from
Mr. Bryan's tongue or pen?"
This is supposed to refer to Tom Johnson, who re
sembles Tilden only in being a millionaire. But
Colonel Bryan scents in this the rankest of reorgani
zation, and, taking his pen in hand, remarks in his
weekly paper: "If a man is ready to retire from poli
tics he may safely- join the reorganizers; but the
men who are candidates, or expect to be, should re
member, first, that political success rests upon the
voters, and, second, they cannot allow their loyalty
to Democratic principles to be questioned. It is
necessary for every Democrat who aspires to leader
ship to let it be known that he has no sympathy with
this attempt to republicanize the Democratic party."
THE political peace has been broken by a -lively
scrap between Major Watterson and Colonel
Bryan. The Major declares for a new platform
and a new leader for the Democracy â "some Tilden
to come to the front in some one of the determinative
States, commanding, as Tilden did, the means to set
a national ticket in the field and able to divide, if
not to command, the independent vote."

A WORD TO PESSIMISTS.
BISHOP DERRICK of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church has just proven Himself at
a -conference :r. Brooklyn to about as wise a
man as there is in this generation. It appears the
conference appointed a committee to report on the
condition of the country, and that the committee in
reviewing the field found many things in the Southern
States that are prejudicial to the welfare of the col
ored man. It was the intention of the committee to
report the evils and to condemn them, but Bishop
Derrick counseled otherwise. He said to them: "A
blank piece of paper is a good deal better than a lot
of inflammatory rubbish. Just report: . '"We have
examined into the condition of the country; and we
find that the United States is at peace with: all the
world.' That will do first rate."
Of course no one has a right to condemn the com
mittee that desired to "roast" the Tillmans and,Mor
gans and other blind leaders of the South who are
seeking by one means or another to deprive the negro
of his just rights. At this juncture, however, when
a number of persons are trying' to render the negro
discontented and dissatisfied with the United States
and are promoting all sorts of schemes, for. -an
exodus to Africa, it is just as well to. act upon the
advice of Bishop Derrick â keep cool and remember
that blank paper is better than an inflammatory ap
peal to passion.. . â¢ .' -
The negroes are not the only people to whom the
wisdom of Bishop Derrick's philosophy may be com :
mended. The whole 'host of those who are forever
looking at. the evils', of , the time and the ; country
might well- profit by reflecting on >Â®Wh^ndeH^
should t not even Bryan, Altgeld and the rest of their
type take -notice' that the United, States- is at ; peace
with all the world, and let it go at that? Then there
A BRITISH ACADEMY OP LETTERS.
REPORTS from London are to the effect. that
the Royal Society, a-scientific body, has under
consideration a project for the establishment
of a British Academy of Letters.. It is believed the
King would cordially second the undertaking, and
that without any great difficulty it could be carried to
success. ... . ;
The chief motive of the promoters is said to be to
establish an authoritative body to fix the standard of
the English language, and decide upon all questions
of, grammar, spelling and correct usage of words and
phrases. In all bur multitude of grammars and dic
tionaries there are hardly any two that agree, and
consequently many points of spelling and of gram
matical construction in the English tongue are largely
matters' of dispute. The Royal Society, having a de
sire for scientific accuracy in language, hopes.to at
tain, it by establishing an academy with authority to
decide on every point on which scholars, grammarians
and dictionary-makers disagree.
In opposition to the movement it is argued that one
of the'advantages the English language has over other
great languages of the world is its freedom from' aca
demic control. By reason of that freedom our
tongue has a flexibility and a capacity, to adopt "new
words that is possessed by no other language; and,
moreover, since- neither in Great Britain nor in this
country have weaver had an academy ; to make a,dic
tionary, individual enterprise .from the. days of Dr.
Samuel Johnson_dpwn to ourtime has furnished each
generation; with much Â¦ dictionaries .than are
possessed by any- other- people. Â¦- . ;' - ' .â¢ '
A' British: Academy of Letters could hardly accom
plish as much for our language as has been done for
that of France by the Academie Frahcaise, for its de
cisions' would hardly" receive the deference shown to
the French ltjstitutibn. The^establishment .of such an
institution/however; would serve to give personal dis
tinction,and titles to some forty or fifty men of.-'emi
nence in the world of letters, and perhaps. that alone
.may be a sufficient inducement to ithe promoters*: to
go. ahead with the Some time ago -there
was a 'good A deal of " discussi on 'in' the j East concerning
the I advisability , of establishing I an" American acad
emy, and if the" British establish one there will almost
certainly be ;'a revival-of'thejmovenient here. \ -The
subject* is therefore cne"that is likely to become of
general interest, for should such an academy be under
taken 7 ; there "would". be a lively; discussion over the
selection of the men to compose it ,

Though coal .was known of in- the eight

till 1820. Several wagon-loads had' been
brought to Philadelphia' and exploited,*
but the public benefactor was . denounced
as a swindler. .. Coal wagons were scarce

until 1840.
Brick-dust vendors passed with sand
men who sung "Sand your kitchens; sand

When the Town Crier Went About.
r The town crier with his bell. added his
voice and. clang to the other confused
sounds. He walked slowly, with, occa
sional stops, crying out lost and found
articles, -notices of articles for sale, , of
town meetings â In fact, such .local events
of temporary interest as would now be
advertised | in a newspaper. Sometimes
he cried them at the lecture or town
meeting. If a - stray domestic .- animal
was found; a cow or a horse, the finder
was required in early days to put about
its^neck as a sign "a wyth or wreath."
Thus bedecked with green branches, the
cow was turned over to. the pound-keeper
while It was cried. Â¦. Â¦ Â¦ . .<
'The crier had a vast amount of busi
ness in announcing lottery drawings,* and
auctions or vendues, which were such a
feature of modes of trade at the begin
ning of the century. Some tradesmen had
private criers.* Here is a notice from a
Boston newspaper: â¢ ; . ,

So also have the great loads of "cord
wood" which were delivered in long 16gs in
front of houses, and were sawed â¢ up on
the edge of the sidewalk, even in crowded
city streets. The wood-sawyer . sawed the
logs and sticks into shoft billets, which,
when grown to an armful, were thrown
down a cellarway with the cry, "Way,
piler," to a comrade In. the cellar, who
was making the woodpile. A brawny.fel
low walking past would have a huge ax
over his shoulder and two jingling iron
wedges hanging from it; his cry was
"Spll-l-t wood!" He split the billets Into
kindling wood, a work the sawyer never
shared nor interfered with.
In -the Days of the Woodpile.
' His loud horn became a nuisance and
was prohibited and he triumphantly sub
stituted a great bell. "Sweep-ohs" were
frequent; a few still linger; an old sweep
still passes my Brooklyn house, slnglns
loudly every week during the spring, but
the boy sweeps have vanished. Soft-soap
men passed with wheelbarrows and bar
rels of soft soap, and city housekeepers
who could not conveniently make soft
soap were glad to buy from them. They
still are seen In New England towns,
where they still buy Boap fat from house
keepers; but the accompanying commod
ity, "hickory ashes," has vanished with
wood ftres. â¢
Â¦ The streets were noisy, but it was -with
human sounds, the cries of. various arti
sans and vendors; there were none of the
clanging metallic sounds of our modern
machines of travel and transportation, our
whistles, bells and gongs, the puffing rat
tle and banging of our trolley cars, our
cable cars, our elevated roads and en
gines, our bicycles and automobiles. There
were sounds of birds and beasts, for hogs
ranged the sheets unchecked, as public
scavengers, and well-to-do citizens â¢ kept
pigeons and poultry in their town yards;
and at morn and night lowing cattle went
from their homes in town stables to out-:

The "charcoal man" was a regular city
street vendor, who is not yet extinct, with
his lpng. narrow black wagon, his sinister

Noises in the Streets.
New York was but a small place. The
majority of the inhabitants lived below
Cortlandt street and Maiden lane. . ; So
doubtful did It seem that there ever
would be many residents above Chambers
street that when the City Hall was built
In the first years of the century it was
decided that the bad* wall should be of
common red stone instead of granite, for
"who would see It?" The City Hotel was
an important edifice, -where now â¢ stands
the Boreal building. It was the first build
ing in the city to be covered with slate
(in 1S0O) instead of old Dutch tile. There
were public gardens; the Indian Queen
and Tyler's, and away uptown was Kip's
Farm. The Battery was set out pro
fusely with" Lombardy poplars.
The stroller along the city streets saw
little in 1801 to Indicate what any Amer
ican city of to-day would be or, indeed,
to show what any of our smaller towns
would be. For every village to-day has
brick houses, and nearly all have one or
two three-story brick blocks. Boston In
1801. was a city of wooden houses "seldom
enlivened with paint." There was but one
brick house in Tremont street. Mrs.Quln
cy wrote: "The ranges of wooden build
ings, all situated with one end toward
the street, and the numerous chaises
drawn -by one horse, the driver placed on
a low seat in front, appeared to me *very
singular." Beacon street In 1802 had but
four houses. In 1804 the father of Wen
dell Phillips built a brick house there.
There were then in -the town fourteen
churches. The rent of houses was high.
There were no brick sidewalks. in Boston
except in Washington street, near â¢ the
Old South Church. The streets were, as
the saying was, "pitched with pebbles,"
and Mrs. Quincy said every one walked
in the middle of the street because there
the pavements were the smoothest.
Horsemen who galloped in the streets
were fined. There were few street lamps;
there was no gas till 1834. . Â¦*
A memorable trial was that of the sev
en Cuban pirates of the ship Panda who
robbed the ship Mexican of Salem ' and
fired her after fastening all the crew be
low. Luckily one skylight of the cabin
proved movable and one of the crew
crawled out and released the others, who
put out the fire, but } kept up a great
smoke till the Panda was out of slehL
The trial was carried on In the Masonic
Temple In Boston, as the court house was
far too small to accommodate the crowd
The pirates were all hanged save one "of
historic name, De Soto. who was nar
doned by the President for a humane ac
tion rendered early In his life to a
wrecked American vessel. He was said
to have been the handsomest man evpr
seen, perfect Iiuface and figure, with sup
erb eyes and eyelashes over an inch long
and the sweetest, gentlest, most lovable
expression ever seen on a human counten
ance.- - . â¢ Â¦Â¦
On the ocean property was most inse
cure," for the high seas were still Infested
with pirates. Merchant ships sailed heav
ily armed and the crews were trained to
fight like men-of-war's men. In 1789 a
friend of the Empress Josephine, sailing
from France to the island of Martinique
was captured by pirates and sold to the
Sultan of Turkey, and became the mother
of the next Sultan. Theodosia Burr Als
ton, the daughter of Aaron Burr, i was
doubtless a later victim of the Barbary
pirates. Hundreds of Americans were
captured Â¦ before .the, bands of . the Medi
terranean and Caribbean seas were exter
minated, the brave Decatur having aided
vastly in this great work.
Provisions for the care of the poor have
varied comparatively little. Pauper chil
dren were usually "bound out" In pri
vate^ families ; after an interval of time,
in the midcentury, during which such
bound - service fell into disrepute, it Is
again our custom to-day, and is the best
treatment we now know for infant pau
pers. There were workhouses for pau
pers, and adult, active paupers could be
sola, for a term of service, the purchaser
paying a sum to the town or State In

for the. smallest sum for which any one
would, agree to give them their "keep":
this sum was paid by the town to the
keeper. Paupersâ men and women -still

Imprisonment for Debt.
Imprisonment for debt 'was a common
practice everywhere. As men could not,
of course, earn money while in prison to
pay their debts, their releases seemed
well-nigh impossible. They bad miserable
cells and wretched food, and their lives
were most pitiable; they begged from
every one who visited the jail and even
called out to passers by from the doors
and windows of their cells. They also ap
pealed through the public' press. Such
notices as this from the New York Gazette
were common: * â¢
"Hark, from the tombs a doleful sound,?
was indeed a true . view of funerals in
1801. Articles In the house of death, such
as mirrors, vases, pictures, etc., were
shrouded in black or white cloth. The
windows of the house were closed, in some
cases for several months. In Philadel
phia the shutters were tied together with
black bands. Mourning was donned even
for distant relatives and worn long. Every
one went to everybody else's funeral.
Black scarfs and gloves were given to
friends and relatives and bells were tolled.
The dead were usually carried to the
grave by bearers and had to be borne
slowly through -the main streets and past
the Town Hall - and the streets were
blocked, with a rabble of curious citizens,
old . and young, that followed the mourn
ers. Men were appointed by, the Select
men to keep free passages In the streets.
Funerals were forbidden to be held on
Sunday, for such vast crowds followed the
coffin that they became disorderly. Sar
gent, in his "Dealings with the Dead,"
writes at length on this subject. In New
York a "funeral inviter" went from house
to house of friends giving the hour of the
funeral and invitations to it. Gentlemen
walked from the house of mourning to the
grave; women seldom attended funerals
and never were present at the Interment.
Everywhere liquors were given to all who
attended the funeral, whether the dead
person were a man of wealth or a pauper.

into his box for a few minutes' shelter
and would sometimes snatch a forbidden
nap. Woe to him if some prowling rogue
or roystering blades -discovered him;, for
they -would fasten the door on the outside
and; call "Watch! Watch!" in tones of
distress; sometimes they upsetthe watch
box with the watchman in it; for it was
not heavy, and was not attached. to side
walk or fence. The streets were lighted
by heavy oil lanterns, which hung over
the middle of the, roadway on ropes or
wires stretched across from wall to wall
or between posts. These lanterns were at
tached to a pulley which enabled the
watchman to draw them I to I the posts
which he would ascend by means of his
ladder, and thus refill the lanterns with
whale oil.
There is nothing essentially new in the statements
of the ex-Minister, but none the less it is well to
have the old truths restated at this time by men who,
like Mr. Denby, speak with the authority of per
sonal experience and high character. The peace of
China has been disturbed not so much by the Box
ers as by the European aggressions that provoked the
Boxers, and .the sooner that fact is understood the
sooner we are likely to have once_more the peace
ful China of the. past. "
That among these various organizations there exist
sojne whose members are hostile to foreigners is not
to be denied. Intolerance of alien ideas and prejudice
against persons of other lands are feelings that can
be found among all races. Moreover, the excellence
of the institutions of China is marred to a great de
gree by the corruption of the higher ,ofncials, and it
is not denied there is urgent need of reform. Con
ceding the truth, therefore, of many of the charges
made against China, Mr. Denby denies that she has
forfeited the right to self-government, and goes on
to ask: "How- is it that without protest, let or hin
drance she has become the prey of European powers?
By what right was opium forced uopn her, defenseless
people? Why are her provinces parceled out as
'spheres of influence' for any power which chooses to
arrogate to itself dominion over them? Why to-day
is the ominous shadow of partition resting on her
broad domains?" v
To that free and easy system of government China
adds a high respect for education, giving it the fore
most place in the state. Of the mutual helpfulness
of the Chinese Mr. Denby says: "China is full of
all kinds of clubs and associations. * * * There
are burial clubs, temperance societies, mutual insur
ance clubs, societies to aid the needy of all ages and
sexes. There are guilds for every branch of business.
The Emperor clothes all the beggars in Peking once
a year,' and issues rations to them all through the
winter months. Rich men give largely to charity.
Schools for boys and girls exist all over China. In
Canton alone there are thirty colleges."
Of their government Mr., Denby. says that while it
is "in frame and shape autocratic, it is the most
democratic in the world." It governs less, perhaps,
than any other government. Its taxation is small,
and its interference~with the people nominal. * * *
There are no political parties, and politics are not dis
cussed in the tea shops. The city furnishes all the
freedom of the rural districts, while in the village the
head man is the only authority. There the villagers on
suitable occasions cuff the magistrate, drag him from
his seat and pull off his official bootsâ the acme of
insult. When he appeals to the Government it says
to him that if he cannot get along with the people
he had better retire, which he does." -
GHARLES DENBY. who for many years was
United States Minister to China, has contrib
uted to the Philadelphia Record an elaborate
review of the salient characteristics â¢ of the Chinese
and their government," and in so doing has once more
pointed out that the Chinese are by no means so bar
barous as a good many Americans and Europeans
imagine. In fact, it appears their government and
their entire T social polity are for them much better
than anything a European power could substitute.
CHINA AND HER QUESTIONS.

Such work will be a great object lesson to the
States and to the owners of private forests, and it
should be entered upon at once, or the reservations,
made to preserve the forests, will become the most
potent agency of their destruction.
We have a closed season for certain fish and game.
The deer that range in the forest are protected by law.
The bucks may be shot only at certain seasons, and
does and. fawns must not be killed at all. But when
the large interests of mankind are considered what
is the extermination of deer compared with the de
struction of the forests in which they find cover?
Not only must the States take up this subject on lines
far more extreme than the excellent beginning made
in North Carolina, but the Federal Government must
speedily enter upon the'proper foresting of its timber
reservations, or they will be destroyed by fire. The
duff and dead wood are rapidly accumulating in those
reservations, and their destruction is certain unless
they are carefully forested. The Government has a
bureau of animal industry and distributes lymph to
cure swine plague and black leg. But the forests
cannot be renewed as rapidly as hogs and cattle.
Why not employ a proper force of trained foresters,
graduates of the Pinchot School at Yale and. of the
New York Forestry School at Cornell, to take
charge of all these reservations and superintend the
clearing of their floor, to prevent the spread of fire?
But it is ( not so with a forest. Under the condi
tions in California, so favorable to coniferous trees,
thirty years are required to produce a merchantable
tree. . Then why not protect the young timber as well
as the young fish and immature veal?
The State of California regulates the age at which
calves may be slaughtered for veal, and punishes se
verely the taking of food fishes below a certain size.
The dealer caught in possession of immature veal
or undersized fish suffers confiscation of the prop
erty, is fined and may be imprisoned. But, consid
ered as a crop, veal and fish are quick growing and
the crop is rapidly renewed, so that the loss by im
proper utilization of either is soon repaired.
It is difficult to conceive of greater injury to others
than is wrought by the extermination of forests.
Wherever it is done the climate is unfavorably af
fected, the fertility of the soil is injured, and all the
future suffers damage. This being so, it is hardly
a doubtful legal experiment for a State to regulate
the cutting of timber en lands in private ownership,
so as not to interrupt the oncoming growth of forest.
If North Carolina can limit ihe area of forest that a
corporation may acquire, she may also regulate the
amount of timber that may be cut on such tract
and the method by which it is to be taken. Instead
of permitting trees to be cut down to eight or six
inches in diameter, such trees may be protected and
left standing until they have reached a larger diame
ter, and- when they are cut the operation must not
destroy the growing crop.
This law is a mild protective measure that will for
a time arrest the wholesale slaughter of the forests.
But it is by no means all that is required. Each State
under its* police powers probably has the right to
regulate the harvesting of timber. States regulate
various industrial operations. They direct how coal
measures shall be timbered and mined, and how
manufactures shall be carried on. The mines, manu
factures and industries so regulated belong to their
owners and operators, who are only using their own.
But the law permits the use of one's own only in
such way as does not injure another.
North Carolina had, probably, the greatest variety
of valuable forest trees found in the South. The
News and Courier has information from Raleigh, in.
that State, of legislation intended to preserve the for
ests. It says that great quantities of pine, as well as
spruce, walnut, chestnut, hickory, maple and other
forest, have been bought up of late years, sometimes
thousands of acres in a lot, and the timber, upward
of one hundred million feet annually, has been
shipped in logs to mills outside the State. To stop
this a law was passed by the last Legislature provid
ing that no corporation shall be allowed to hold or
lease more than 300 acres of timber land unless it
maintains' a mill within the-State at which the lum
ber it cuts shall be manufactured, and no corporation,
unless created under the laws of North Carolina and
having its principal place of business in . the State,
shall hold more 'than 300 acres of timber land. Vio
lation of the law works escheat' of -the timber land
to the State.
THE Charleston's. C.) - News and Courier,
noting approvingly The Call's warning against
the coming timber famine, repeats it for the
benefit of. the Southern States, where the forests of
pine, oak, hickory and walnut are rapidly dis
appearing.

"How could I help writing romances aft

unspoiled by their very considerable suc

father. Sir Henry Fowler, it is said, is
considerably more interested in their lit

political world and reads every notice of
their books with the keenest interest. Hi*
stories of bygone Methodism greatly help
ed his daughters, adding a lifelike Inter
est to their books.
It Is not perhaps very generally known
that Miss Edith Fowler wrote books be
fore her sister, Ellen Thorneycroft Fow
ler, had made her name with "Isabel Car
naby." Miss -Edith Fowler had already
written "The Professor's Children" and
"The -Young Pretenders." The sisters,
says Malnlv- About People, criticize each
other's work very freely and, unlike many
sisters, â¢ take the advice of one another.
The younger of the two recently pub

is laid in Devonshire, and a serial story
of hers which will shortly appear In book
form, entitled "The World and "Winslow,"

published by Messrs. Chatto & Wlndus.
It is the life story of a well-known man

said about the -war of 1S70, besides many
stories of Napoleon III., the present Em
peror of Austria, Bismarck, Count An
drassy, Johann Strauss, Qffenbacbv Howe,
the medium, and Dumas tils. There ara
numerous anecdotes relating to Bohemian
life In London twenty. years ago.

Tkla paper will also be on iale at all nmiut
Â¦vaorts and la represented by s local ageat in
all town Â«n th* coast.The Southern \ Pacific filed with the
Railroad Commissioners yesterday an an
swer "to the complaint of John" La Blanc,
a prominent", oilman of - Bakersfleld. - La
Blanc in his\romplaiht alleged that the
rates charged by the railroad companies
for hauling petroleum , were excessive,
and so high that there was no profit left
for the producer. He also claimed that
the price of $5 for switching cars from Oil
City to the spurs adjacent to the wells
was exorbitant. Â¦ ? "
The answer- ro the complaint is signed
by Attorney Foulds of the Southern Pa
cific and is a lengthy document. The at
torney in his reply claims that the price
of oil at the present time is low through
the . mismanagement of oil men in gen
eral; that they keep cutting the price of
petroleum to try and compete with each
other and that the result is that oil is
sold far too cheap. He also pointed out
that a number of the oil companies /are
so short of funds that they have not
enough capital to even build an oil tank
to store the oil for. a short" time, but
have to rush it straight to the market.
The answer also argues that the price
of switching is perfectly fair, and that
the Southern Pacific can see no over
charges or any reason why the "present
prices for transporting petroleum should
be changed. <." ;
A complaint has also been filed against
the Santa Fe Railway on v the same
grounds, but no" answer has been filed,
pending which no action will be taken in
the matter by the Railroad Commission
ers.

MRS. H. WORMS. WHO WAS CHOSEN SUB-CHIEF COMPANION OF
THE GRAND CIRCLE, COMPANIONS OF THE FOREST, AFTER AN
EXCITING ELECTION AT YESTERDAY'S SESSION.
THE Grand Circle of the Compan
ions of the Forest of America held
another session in Elks Hall yes
terday. The morning was taken
Â¦ up in passing upon the acts and de
cisions'of the grand chief companion and
of the executive council. All of these
were approved. The principal matter con
sidered was the action of the executive
council in granting T. F. Blake of Grass
Valley a certificate as member at large,
he at the time being a member of Inde
pendence Circle, which was suspended by
ilrs. Flora Jacobs, then grand chief com
panion, for insubordination. The execu
tive council gave as a reason for its action
that it had ascertained that Mr. Blake
was blameless, and believing that one who
was innocent should not be made to suffer
for the wrongdoings of others, had
granted him the certificate. It was also
shown that since he had been readmitted
into the order he had organized a circle
in the city in which he lives that had since
grown to have 129 members.
The committee on " honored dead pre
sented a report giving the names of those
wl:o had passed, away since the previous
session and extending sympathy to the
relatives of those deceased.
The afternoon session was taken up in
the election of the grand officers. There

dainty pompadour furnishings, white
roses and trailing vines were used. In the

.every known variety filled every bowl
and vase. .
In the dining-room four large round
tables were each differently and elabor
ately decorated. At _the table at which
Miss Scott was seated the color effect
was white and green. 'White iris and
delicate ferns were used, the Iris rising
straight and gracefully from a bed of
cool greenery. The second table was In
yellow and white. The flowers used were
the new white poppy with the golden
heart, dandelion puffs and coreopsis.
The popples were placed In a little vase
in the center of the table. A garland of
the brilliant coreopsis surrounded the
poppies, and the dandelion puffs broke at
intervals the golden garland.
The third table was decorated with
heartsease, maidenhair fern and trailing
vines of clematis.
At the fourth table gladioli shading
from a shell pink to a deep red and five
fingered ferns made an exquisite decora
tion. Luncheon was â¢ served at 1:30
o'clock.
Mrs. Martin wore an elegant gown of
black point d'esprit over white silk. The

The meshes In the net of condemning
evidence which the prosecution is labor
ing to weave about "Sir" Harry West
wood Cooper, alias Ernest Moore Chad
wick, were materially strengthened yes
terday. But for all that it will be more
than a week before the case will, be ready
for submission to the jury for judgment.
The courtroom continues to be I crowded
with spectators eager to catch a glimpse
of the prisoner and to hear again how
"Sir Harry" gained the hand of pretty
Norine Schneider. The defendant, no
matter who the witness was or how dam
aging his testimony, maintained the same
impassive countenance, the same indif
ferent almost apathetic manner .
Although the allegation of bigamy was
not proven beyond, a shadow of a doubt
yesterday, some very damaging bits of
testimony along. that line were introduced.
John A. Pickett, clerk of the Hotel Lang
ham, testified that the defendant came to
the hotel in August, 1897, with a woman
whom he acknowledged as his wife. The
woman wag not Norine Schneider.
This testimony was corroborated by
Captain . Seymour, who testified that on
August 31, 1897, he visited the Langham
for the purpose of placing Cooper under
arrest. He was requested Dy "Sir" Harry
to notify "his wife" of the reason for his
si^lden absence. Subsequently he dis
covered a marriage .certificate among
Cooper's effects and- was requested 'by
him to deliver it to "Mrs. Cooper" at' the
Langham Hotel. The marriage certificate,
which was issued in the Province of
Ontario, Canada, was introduced In evi
dence. ' . .
Captain Seymour further testified that
the defendant on one occasion had asked
if a plea of guilty to the charge of forg
ery were made would the penalty be de
creased. On that occasion, although deny
ing that he wrote the telegram which was
forwarded to Norine Schneider, Cooper ac
knowledged that he was responsible for
the Bending of. the message.
. Writing Experts Kytka and Eisenchim
mel. who have been employed by the po
lice to make a study of Cooper's penman
ship, occupied the stand during the en
tire afternoon. They were positive that
"Sir" Harry's was the hand that penned
the famous telegram. Many exemplars
of Cooper's writing had been introduced
for identification, and the experts had
made an exhaustive study of them.
Mme. Laura Germain and Attorney
Humphrey were called to the stand to
identify specimens of Cooper's handwrit
ing, which were admitted for further
identification. William S. Cowtn, the tele
graph operator at Crockett, identified the
telegram as one which had been forward
ed to Norine Schneider from this city.
- Ah adjournment was taken until Mon
day morning at 10 o'clock.

PROMINENT BUSINESS MAN'S
SON AND HANDSOME GIRL
WHO IS NOW HIS BRIDE.
Mrs. Alta D. Hatten. a young widow
who is employed in a photograph gallery
and lives at 35 Sixth street, swore to a
complaint in Judge Fritz's court yester
day for the arrest of William J. Lock
hart, on a charge of misdemeanor em
bezzlement.
Mrs. Hatten met Lockhart about three
months ago while they were boarding at
121 Fulton street. Lockhart is a carriage
painter and was at the time employed in
a shop on Golden, Gate avenue. He was
very attentive to Mrs. Hatten's little boy,
and then she says he began making "goo
goo eyes" at her. He Â¦was known as "goo
goo eyes" in the boarding house, she
cays. Owing to his attentions to her boy,
they began to bow to each other and fin
ally entered into conversation.
Lockhart, after they became acquaint
ed, told her that he was an aeronaut,
and said if she bad any funds to tide
over preliminary difficulties and would
join him in a partnership in the business,
he was sure they would make money. He
said he had a balloon but it was in
pawn, and if she would advance him
the money to redeem it he would take it
to Los Angeles, where he has an engage
ment tc make an ascension. She would
get 40 per cent of the receipts.
Mrs. Hatten advanced the money to
take the balloon out of pawn, and paid
Lockhart's fare and her own to Los An
geles, but whea they got there Lockhart
informed her. that the engagement was
off and they returned to the city, she
paying both fares and all expenses.
Nothing daunted, Lockhart continued
to delude the accommodating wid
ow, and grot her to believe that
he could secure remunerative en
gagements for balloon ascensions in
New Mexico, and on June 1 she gave him
the money to purchase tickets for him
and herself to Albuquerque. That was
the last Ehe has seen or heard of him,
and she is now convinced that he has
been deceiving her all the time, as she
Fays she has learned that he is not an
aeronaut but a carriage painter. Alto
gether she says she has advanced him
$195 on his aeronaut proposition. vÂ» -^

NEW YORK. June 6.â There was a decided
subsidence of speculative activity In stocks to
day with a resulting impression on prices.
Losses are quite large in some of the principal
active stocks which have been recent favorites
,1a the speculation. The market was ruled very
largely by technical considerations. It devel
oped from the smaller volume of the dealings
and the lack of support' for prices that yester
day'e operations had resulted in the elimina
tion cf a short interest and that the demand
frcrr. this source to cover short contracts had
ljf en taken advantage of by the bull contingent
to realize profits on heavy long' lines of stocks.
This mutual closins up of accounts had a de
cided effect â¢ on the speculative appetite, and
the ushering in of the hot season accentuated
the indifference of the trading. There wtrt
rumc rs current ail day that the covering by
the bears yesterday had been achieved at con
siderable coi-t and more or less uneasiness was
caused by this fact. The emphatic denials
frorv. official sources of a number of the rumors
which -have played a part in the recent bull
movement, especially those bearing on con
solidations and absorptions of > many of the
minor railroad systems, was a somewhat de
pressing factor. An influence In the same di
rection was the disclaimer on the part of. the
parties interested of the assumption that the
entrance into the Atchison directory of a mem
ber of tlie firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. was an
indication of Morgan holdings of the stock with
a view of establishment of community of in
terest. The net changes in stocks give no ade
quate idea of the extent of the day's price
ranges There was a considerable show of
strength at the opening, partly due to the in
fluence <>f London on account of the reduction
in the Bank of England rate and also on ac
count of the operations by a coterie of Ameri
cans now in London. The redaction- in the
bank rate is accepted as thorough assurance
over the future of the foreign money market*.
as London has large future needs to meet and
owes targe sums to Paris, which It Is important
to keep In the London market by the payment
cf an attractive rate of interest. The selling
pressure, however, made an end of the advance
before the end of the first hour. The feverish
tone of Rock Island was a somewhat unsettling
influence, owing to fears that a corner may
develop in . that stock. ; The various Â¦ tobacco
companies were mos-t prominent and advanced
on the incorporation of the new company, in
Ne* Jersey, which" Is believed to be for the
purpose of taking: over and combining all. the
liresent companies. American Tobacco rose an
extreme 1%, Continental : Tobacco 2%, the pre
ferred 554 and American Snuff 4Vi- -. Louisville

- CHICAGO, June 6.â Generally the wheat mar
ket was dull. July, on account of reports of
beneficial rains in the Northwest, opening un
changed to }ic lower at 74%c to 75c' ' There
was a considerable quantity offered and quick
ly the market declined to 74 J ,4c. Reports from
Missouri indicated a crop condition of 83,
against 99 for last month, and this put a check
on both September and July offerings. . There
was some profit taking by shorts, and these cir
cumstances caused a reaction to 74%c. Â¦ The
improvement v.-as only temporary, however, and
there w.is a gradual decline to the end. But
for the fact that the bull leader in corn, who
previously had been on both sides of the mar
ket, began buying liberally, July would have
suffered a much greater loss. September failed
to maintain its early, firmness, and eased in
sympathy with July. The latter delivery closed
weak and "l%c lower, at 73%c. .The volume of
business was not extensive. September wheat
sold between 70Vic and 71%c and closed 1%@1 1 /4C
lower at 70Â»4<S:70%c. . .
The corn market was easier to begin with
and decidedly weak later in the session. July
closed weak, l(g IVaC lower. " ' , ,
Oats were weaker and unsettled. July closed

WHEATâ Chicago was dull and unsettled al
the openeing, but declined all day, getting
down to nV*c. Further rains have relieved the
situation . ever} where except in Kansas, and
partially there. Light frosts in Nebraska, did
no damage. Northwestern advices were bear
ish and Southwestern bullish. 'The Missouri
State report gives the condition of that crop at
83 against 99 in May. The Cincinnati Price
Current says that both winterand spring wheat
are promising. The damage to winter wheat
last month' was nearly 5 per cent. Oats will
probably be a short crop, and corn is Â¦Â¦ back

CLOSING.
The stock market continues dull; with deal
ings very light .in volume. To-day's trading
was inactive but steady.; The bank rate .was
reduced from 4 to 3^ per cent. This was a
favorable factor, but the bank's action, had
been generally expected .and the effect was,
therefore, pretty well discounted.
American shares were the briskest, but even
in this . department speculators were timid and
were generally content to deal In small lots.
The list opened rather dull, but hardened
somewhat i on the announcement of - the Â¦ re
duction In the bank rate. The advance was
followed and supported by : buying for the
New York â¢ account. Toward the end of the
session quotations broke somewhat. I but there
was a rally on buying on the curb after the
close. The favorites were Louisville and Nash
ville and Southern Pacific, the latter being
prominent because of dividend talk. . Atchlson
was a dollar lower. * V.'.V.V

steamship, Assyrian, from Antwerp for
Montreal with 2000 j tons 'of cargo,- is
ashore off Cape Race. ' She has eleven
feet of water in her forehold and Is likely
to prove a total wreck. Her crew had
great difficulty in escaping, and reaching
the shore. The "steamship Algerine iwas
dispatched to the scene of the wreck s by
Lloyd's agents. Â¦Â¦-.;-. . ,.
It now seems likely that the voyages of
the Assyrian have ended. She was run
ning at full speed through the fog when
she struck Cape Race, and she now lies
almost a hulk on the coast. For * three
days Captain pingrle had, been navigating
by the log and he had calculated upon a
â¢course rounding Cape Race thirty miles
south of land. This plan,- however, was
frustrated by northerly currents. ". 'Â¦ - : Â¦"
The Assyrian struck at 11:40 last night.
Land had been sighted only a minute be
fore. The fog was dense and there was
no time to reduce her speed. She struck
the face of the cliff and was forced upon
the outlying rocks. The Impact tore out
the bottom of the . two forward holds.
She heeled over to the starboard when
her side glanced against the cliff.- â¢
The crew at first . was panic-stricken,
but after a time comparative calm was
restored and precautions were taken - to
secure the safety 'Oi all on board. .When
the extent of ' her injuries was disclosed,
It was seen that she was badly damaged,
but would outlast any ( except a severe
storm. The arrival of daylight enabled
Captain Dingle to land the mate, who
climbed the cliffs,- proceeded to Cape Race

In the shape of a membership In the State
Building and Loan .Commission. While
the official announcement of the appoint
ment has not been made yet; it is known
that It will be forthcoming to-morrow or

Governor Gage said to-night that he had
not yet filled any of the vacancies In the
commission and would not confirm the re
port that Field will be honored with a
place In thÂ© commission. The friends of
Field declare, however, that he has been
decided upon for the place and that his
appointment will soon be made. It may
be that Governor Gage will not announce
the appointment until he returns to Sac
ramento. There were fifteen or twenty
applicants for the position from Los An
geles, but a week or more ago many of
those who became convinced that Field
had the inside track abandoned their ef

JA terday afternoon and watched
them receive their certificates of
award for the year's work.' The hall was
prettily decorated with flowers and green
ery. ,and the stage on which the children
rendered the programme was set in sylvan
scenes and made a fitting background for
the young students, who were dressed In
white gowns.'
An excellent programme was presented
and each number Was heartily applauded.

pupils. The diplomas and certificates
were presented by Rev. Father Nugent,
pastor of St. Brendan's Church, j Fol

Congregatlonallsts and the University
of California Regents are alike i anxious
that no misapprehension arise regarding
the Earl iectureship that has just been
founded at the Bacific Theological Semin
ary at Berkeley. While the lectures will
be open to the public and it is hoped to
make them of interest and profitable to
students of the university, they will be in
no way whatever connected with the State
Institution. Â¦'â¢..â¢
: - Rev. George C. Adams, pastor of the
First Congregational Church, who Is fa
miliar with the plans of the board of trus
tees of the theological seminary, explains
then) as follows:
"The fund endowing the lectureship will
be administered by the board of trustees
of the seminary. A committee of three
has been appointed from the. trustees to
secure the lecturer to inaugurate the lec
tureship. . Rev. Dr. J. K. McLean is chair
man of the committee.
"The intention is to get each year one
of the Congregational * church's most
eminent men to deliver , a series of lec
tures. He will be chosen ' from among the
Eastern theologians or great thinkers In
allied fields, or in case of the presence In
this country of. some eminent; scholar
from Great Britain effort will be made to
secure him.... "Â¦ ' ' . S Â¦ Â¦
"The, series will be similar in character
to the Lyman Beecher lectures at Yale or
the Bampton lectures at Oxford. Prob
ably each series will be published In book
"The university will have no connection
whatever with these lectures, except that
its students will be warmly welcomed to
them. They will be delivered either "in
our church at Berkeley or in the lecture
hall I of tho seminary> â¢ not in a college
building." , Â«
Regent J.B. Relnstein said yesterday
that' any apprehension felt on account of
the endowment of the lectureship was un
founded. . â¢ Â¦ - Â¦' . â¢ â¢Â¦'Â¦â¢â¢,
- "There has been no tender to us," Mr.
Relnstein said, "of the endowment fund
and ho thought of any connection between
U and the university. The State constitu
tion very, explicitly forbids sectarian or
religious Â¦ instruction Â¦ ot - influences,
arid there "Â¦ Is - no Â¦ danger . Â¦ of q. the
Regents acting in disregard ' of the
constitution. The University < of â¢ Cali
fornia has been - kept free - from sec
tarian or political Influences and will be
kept soMn the future. The people would
not tolerate any; departure froniv that
policy. Of course, if religious sects deslro
to establish colleges or lectureships at
Berkeley and give free access to them to
students of the State -University we can
not prevent that if we should desire to do

<- "The lectureship," said General' Barnes
of the Board of > Regents. "Is .^purely a
church; affair. The Regents have nothing
whatever to do with: It. The lectures will
not be given in a university. building-, nor
controlled by university' authorities, nor
advertlaed as' a. university, series. ';, Of
course, ; any sect Is free to proceed as the
Congregatfohallsts have done, and -if Â¦ they
should all Â¦â¢ do so * it would not i affect the

A monthly magazine, "The School

of the academy, was circulated yesterday
at the exercises, and the contents Includ
ed some very clever essays written by
the young ladles who received certificates

The five young ladies who received
their diplomas at the hands of Arch
bishop Rlordan were: Misses Marie Tier

A short address was delivered by' the
Archbishop, who tendered a tribute to
the sisters in charge of the. academy and
besought the pupils to give their entire
energy to the educational work outlined
for them. The programme, which was in

"Although the Midland Railway Com
pany would not give, another order unless
in exceptional circumstances, it would not
be correct to s%y that the American loco
motives are not good. The Americans can
make them as well as we can, but the
conditions are different. Ours : are better
under all circumstances. There Is no mar
ket in the English railways for American
engines. Abroad it is different." .
Sir ErnesfPaget, chairman of the Mid
land Railway Company, will confirm John
son"3 statement in the Daily Mail, but will
say:
"In the United States they make their
engines on an entirely different principle
and with- quite an opposite idea to ours
as to the future. In the United States
you take an engine off the peg, as it were,
and from then work it right out until it
dies, giving It no rest. The American con
tention Is that by the time it is done for
something better will come on. We make
our engines as good as we possibly' can
and then we tend to them carefully, rest
them, clean them and do everything to
make them last. ' I :' " ' 'Â¦â¢ '
The American locomotives In question
cost Â£400 less than the British. They were

while the locomotives ordered of British

the strike. . . :

NEW YORK, June 6.â There was much
excitement at the Amalgamated Copper
Company's special meeting In Jersey City
to-day to vote on the proposition to in
crease the capital stock from J75.CO0.00O to
$153,000,000. The injunction proceedings in
stituted yesterday by the opponents ot
..he Boston and Montana Copper Com
pany, to prevent the deal from going
through to-day, lent unusual interest to
the meeting-.
Vice Chancellor Stevens had Issued an
order restraining the merger, but permit
ting to-day's meeting in order that thÂ«
sentiments of the stockholders might ba
obtained. William H. Corbin, counsel for
the Amalgamated Copper Company, was
elected chairman of the meeting. Clar
ence H. Venuer of Boston, In behalf of
the opposition, moved to adjourn until
June 20, but before Corbin would enter
tain this motion he directed that the con- .
troller, Robert S. Jordan of Jersey City./
and Le Grande Bouker find out how many '
shares were represented and by whom. It
was found that 591.300 shares were repre
sented out of a total ot 750,000. more than
the recuired "two-thirds. . :.
Flavel McGee and Isaac S. Taylor, rep
resenting the opponents of the proposed
absorption, directed the fight In person
and were aided by Venner, who next
moved that the Inspectors of election re
port specifically the number e-f stockhold
ers represented by proxy and those repre
sented in person; also that a record bo
made of those stockholders represented
by James Stlllman, A. R. Flower, Majes
Bacon and James Jordon._ This motion
was voted down. .
Venner next v/anted a stock vote, but
Corbin said there was no reason for that.
Venner next moved that all proxies held
by Stlllman, Flower. Bacon and Jordan
be rejected as illegal. This was also vot
ed down, and John A..' Garver. Â¦ counsel
for the Amalgamated Company, read a
report by a special committee recom
mending the acquisition of the Boston
and Montana and the Butte and Boston
mining companies. Venner moved to re
ject all the proxies of the Bacon-Stillman
faction on the ground that the proxies
had not been properly stamped. This was
voted down. As the decisive Yote was
taken, Venner made a speech declaring
that the -proceedings were "fraudulent."
and the proposed deal "scandalous." He
added: â¢ ' -
"If the court does not enjoin this In
iquitous proceeding, then I say we have
no further use for the court." I Â¦
The resolutions to increase the stock
as proposed, and to purchase the Boston
and Montana and Butte and Boston com
panies, was passed by a vote of E95,5S5
shares to 304. Another resolution was
passed to the effect that the carrying out
of the two other resolutions be subject
to the approval of the chancery court.
The' purchase price mentioned In the
resolution is 5^2 shares of Amalgamated
stock for one share of Boston and Mon
tana stock, ami 1 1-3 shares of Butte and
Boston stock.
By the ' terms of the resolutions "adopt
ed, the price of the two properties pur
chased is placed at J50.000.0W. The com
mittee adjourned to meet June 10. \ : * Â¦Â¦>

E. H. Arclew of Ohio read the report of
the committee on railroad statistics. The
report was mainly a suggestion that some
plan be adopted to secure uniformity in
reports of statistics, but no plan was sub
mitted by the committee. The subject was
referred to a committee to be appointed
on the same- subject. ' . >
J. C. Wilborn of North Carolina read the
report from the committee on the uniform
Classification tit freight. The report sug
gests that Congress be asked to empower
the Interstate Commerce Commission to
establish a uniform classification of
freight in interstate business. The hope
of the committee Is that such a plan of
uniform freight classification might prove
successful in interstate business, and that
then the States would be willing to put
the same classification in force In State
business, thereby securing a uniform clas
sification in all business and throughout
the whole country.
The committee -on classification of con
struction expenses reported ' that the
present system of accounting seems to
meet general approval, and as no one had
asked or suggested any changes' the com
mittee decided that no change would be
advisable. In connection with the report
there was read a letter from H. D. Buck
ley, controller of the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, in which he wrote: "I do not see
any necessity whatever for changing the
classification of expenses as adopted some
years ago by the officers of the Associa
tion of American Railway Accounting Of
ficers, wliich was accepted and promul
gated by the Interstate Commerce Com
mission, and now in use on the various
railroads, and in my judgment should not
be chanered." â¢
Wo recognize the vast Importance of the
subject. Wo realize that there la no function
of sovereignty more used and abused than that
ot taxation. The three elements of on ideal
system of taxation are recognized to be equal
ltr, economy and certainty. We also appre
ciate the Inability of the human mind to per
fectly unite these three elements in any one
system of taxation, particularly as- applicable
to railroads. There seems to be, from our ov
portunltles of observation, as many different
systems of railroad taxation as there are tax-
Ing Jurisdictions.
ThÂ« matter is of such supreme importanco
that we would suggest a continuance, of such
a committee as this, to report freely and com
prehensively to the next meeting of the asso
ciation.
This morning at 10 o'clock the ladles of
the party â¢will be given a ride over the
principal cable systems of the city. To
morrow morning there will be an excur
sion on the bay arid a trip to Mount Tam
alpais. As the capacity of the engines on
the mountain road is limited only 150 can
go on the special train, and there are 200
who wish to go. So it has been decided
that those upon the convention roll shall
each be given a ticket for himself and
for one other, and only those holding
these tickets will be allowed to take the
bay excursion. The extra fifty will be
given tickets that will entitle them to the
trip on one of the regular trains. ;
At the session yesterday afternoon the
committee on railroad taxation reported
and asked for further time so that a full
and comprehensive report may be sub
mitted at the next session of the com
missioners. In making its report the com
mittee has this to say:
The Railroad Commissioners cleared up
most of their business yesterday and to
day probably will see the end of their ses
sion. There were several reports from
committees read and discussed, and these
occupied the time of the entire day.

The smoke was caused by a pot of glue,
and there was not the slightest cause for
alarm. Officer Peters rushed down the
aisles and tried to calm the excited wo
men, while Actor Neill stepped to the
footlights and berpred all present to re
main seated. The attaches threw open all
the exits of the theater and -those who
ran out soon returned to enjoy the bal
ance of the performance.
Policeman "Clem" Peters was In the
house when the cry of "fire" was raised.
Rur-hlng down the aisle to the stage, he
Fhouted to the terror-stricken women to
keep their seats.
"There is no fire," he loudly declared,
waving his hand to attract their atten
tion. "Keep auiet and you will be ail
right "
His words had a reassuring effect and
the gallery gods loudly applauded him.
In the balcony the greatest excitement
prevailed. A number of women rushed
pellmell down the stairs, falling over each
other In their mad desire to get out of
the place. In their excitement several of
them lost their purses and other articles
of value.
Some foolish person raised a cry of
"flre," and instantly the entire audience
rose from the seats and a rush was made
for the doors.
"While the large audience, chiefly com
poeed of women, was enjoying the per
formance a wreath of smoke blew
through a doorway leading from the side
of the theater to the California Hotel.
A panic at the California Theater dur
ing the matinee yesterday afternoon was
only averted by the prompt action of Po
llceman Peters and the attaches of the

The Republicans of the city seem to
have resolved, by general consent, to pay
no attention to the boss factions repre
sented by so-called, county- committees.
The contest for delegates to the Munici
pal Nominating Convention will be con
ducted under the provisions of the new
primary elections law. Assurance Is given
that ballots cast will be honestly tallied.
At the open easy-going primary last fall
ballot boxes were stuffed and smashed
and returns were manipulated to suit the
will of the bosses. As a fair primary
election safeguarded by law is in sight
there is an incentive for citizens to regis
ter and vote. Every - voter who has
moved from one dwelling place to an
other since the last general election
should go at once to the registration
office and .be. registered anew. The bat
tle for good government in this city will
be fought at the primary election, hence
registration should be attended to with
out delay.

leadership in the next State campaign.
Rumors to the effect that Governor Gage
has all the plans laid for securing the re

Mr. Edson. "Word comes from Gazelle

Edson for Governor, and the Railroad

leadership. Frequent soundings to ascer
tain the depth of public sentiment have
been made by the friends of the aspiring
Commissioner, and they advise him to

Mr. Edson is described as a statesman
of the Governor Stanford type. He is
said to be plain, rich and practically
benevolent. The ' farmers of Northern
California delight to say that he "looks
like a Governor." Wise men of the Re
publican party do not encourage the sug
gestion of conducting the next campaign
on the shape of the candidate, but form
will' surely count for something.' Com

to consist of "grain, landed possessions
and live stock." . â¢Â¦*
