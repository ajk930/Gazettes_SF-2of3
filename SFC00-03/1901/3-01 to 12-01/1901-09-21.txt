Admiral Francis J. Higginson, comman
der in chief of the North Atlantic squad
ron, was the first witness called. He said
he had as captain commanded the battle
ship . Massachusetts during the Spanish
war r.nd that for a part of the time the
Massachusetts had been a part of the
"Elying Squadron," of which Admiral
Schley had been in^command. He told of
joining the fleet at Newport News; of go
ing to Key West, and then, on the 22d of
May, of going to Clenfuegos, Cuba. Key
West had. been left on May 19, 1899, and
Cienfuegos reached on the 22d. '
"What was . then done to secure com
munication with the Cuban forces on
shore?'' Lemly asked.
"Nothing to my . knowledge," the, wit
ness replied. . "I did not see that anything
was done, but I understood that informa
tion concerning the Cubans was received
through Captain* McCaHu." ' . -
Admiral Higginson said, "in response to
questions, that^this was later. He also
told, in reply to questions,^ of the pres
ence of. the. collier Merrimac : and of .the
departure from Cienfuegos and "the ar
rival at' Santiago -on the ; evening of 'the
26th. In reply to questions, he said , that
the Massachusetts had at that time' taken
on about thirteen tons of coal.'-but that as
the weather was rough this was done with
difficulty. .â¢._Â¦. ..
The also told of Oie fleet leav
ing Santiago for Key .West â¢ on' the night
of its arrival at the former:' place and â¢
how, after "steaming -..westward 1 ; for some i
time, .the vessels, all in response to Com

steamed to within two or : three- miles of
the mouth of the harbor.

was challenged, whether he had objection
to urge against any member of the court.
The admiral arose as this question was
asked and replied, "I have not" '
The judge advocate then swore the mem
bers of the court collectively, and then in
turn was sworn as judge advocate. ;'\ ;
this was accomplished Captain Lemly
turned to Rear Admiral Schley and asked
him, as he did when Admiral Howison
miral Ramsay to a place on the court In
place of Rear Adimal Howison, and when
Rear Admiral Ramsay occupied the seat
â¢which on the first day of the session was
filled by Rear Admiral Howison. All
three members of the court were in ser
vice uniform, and the morning air was
cold enough to. make their closely but
toned coats appear comfortable. Mrs.
Dewey accompanied her husband and re
mained a short t!me.
The court was called to order by a sim
ple word from Admiral Dewey. The first
order of business was the reading by
. Judge Advocate Lemly of the order of the
Navy Department appointing Rear Ad-
Admiral Ramsay Accepted.
"Will Shorten Inquiry.
Judge Advocate Lemly admitted that
the precedents were against questions of
this character, and the court withdrew
this interrogatory. It ?s generally admit
ted that this decision will have the effect
of materially shortening the term of the
court, as will, also the court's Intention to

tion. Admiral Dewey showed himself a

called the court to order exactly at
the designated hour and adjourned it just
as promptly at 4 o'clock.
The witnesses to-day were Rear Ad
miral Higginson, who commanded j the
battleship Massachusetts during the
Spanish war; Captain C. M. Chester, who
commanded the cruiser Cincinnati; Major
Thomas N. Wood of 'the marine corps,
who commanded the marines on the Mas
sachusetts, and Commander G. B. Harber,
who was executive officer of the Texas,
the latter being on the stand when the
court adjourned. The attendance of the
public was small. ....
tant incident of the day was
the decision of the court withdrawing a
question put by the court itself asking a
witness to give his opinion concerning a
point under controversy. The witness was
Rear Admiral Higginson, who partici
pated in the Santiago campaign as. cap-,
tain of the battleship Massachusetts. This
vessel at one tivne was a. part of the flying
squadron commanded by. Commodore
Schley, and the court asked him to state
Â¦whether all posrible measures were taken
to capture" or destroy the' Spanish, vessel
Cristobal Colon as it lay in Santiago har
bor from May 27 to June 1, 1S9S. Counsel
for Admiral Schley objected to the ques
tion on the ground that a reply would in
volve an opinion and not a statement of
facts.
. Â»
WASHINGTON. Sept. 20.â The
Schley court of Inquiry re
convened to-day and before
it adjourned examined four
Â¦witnesses. The most; impor-
Raynor made an .'extended argument,
quoting many legal authorities against
the admisslbility of the opinion of wit
nesses, and he was speaking when at 1
o'clock the court took a recess for an
hour for luncheon.
Promptly at 2 o'clock the court was
called to order by Admiral Dewey and
Raynor resumed his argument in opposi
tion to the admlssibility of questions in
tended to call out the opinions of wit
nesses'. He contended that If the testi
mony giving opinions should be admitted
the Inquiry would be interminable. If. for
instance, opinions were to be taken as to
the. propriety of the loop made by tho
Brooklyn, practically the entire navy
could be summoned, as all Its members
were experts and each would have his
; opinion. Witnesses were expected, to re
late facts; the court to give opinions.'
Replying, Judge Advocate Lemly "quoted
the record in the trial if Admiral Keppel,
arguing . thart it Â¦ was entirely within the
discretion . of the court to â¢ decide whether
the opinion of a '.witness who had been on
the ground should be called for by the
court. - He - thought, â¢ however, that the
Dewey Takes a Hand.
Admiral Deweyâ "In the opinion of one
member of the court and perhaps of the
others we do not ask his opinion, but for
a statement of a matter of fact. We ask,
â¢Was everything done?' We don't say in
your opinion."
Causes a Controversy,
The question and reply led to a legal '
controversy. - "Wilson and Eaynor. both
gave reasons for their objections. They
contended that the question called for the
opinion of the witness, whereas only facts
were admissible.
' Raynor asked: "May I ask the court
if, according to the method. of procedure
here, the court has ruled that we are not
at liberty to object to any question at all
that may be asked?" >,:"â¢""â¢.".
Admiral Dewey replied: "While this
court is bound to investigate all the facts,
we have the right to ask any "question
that will bring out the facts. One of the
charges against Admiral Schley is
whether or not every . effort incumbent
upon the commanding officer of the fleet
under such circumstances was made by
Commodore Schley to capture or destroy
the Spanish cruiser Colon as she lay at
anchor' in the entrance at Santiago har
bor May 27 to 31, inclusive. "We ifcava
asked that question sy*a we have his (Ad
miral Higginson's) opinion. This court by
the precept is obliged to v give an opinion
upon the conclusion of the investigation.
Now, in the'opinion of the court, and in
order to form our opinion, we wanted Ad
miral Higginson's opinion on that sub
ject." ' ->?-'.
! Wilsonâ "I understand from the precept,
reading it through from end to end, to>
be simply this, that there shall be an in
vestigation to* get at the facts. And when
you have gotten at the facts then you ex
press your opinion; but you are not called
upon, as I must- respectfully submit, and
are not permitted to take some onÂ© else's
opinion. You have a right to get all tha
facts you can, and that is what we want,
but otherwise you will see that you might
have- a great variety of- opinions and- all
the opinions of subordinates. In other
words, the precept don't call for anybody'3
opinion except the opinion of the honora
ble court."
was as to whether there was any pla.cs
of shelter near Santiago where the flying
squadron could have coaled after its arri
val at Santiago.
Admiral Higginson replied that Guanta
namo was only forty miles to the east
The third Question, cosing as it , did
from the court, created something ot a
sensation, which was added to by the
reply. The question was:
"Was every effort made by Admiral
Schley to destroy or capture the Spanish
steamer Colon as she lay at anchor in the
/harbor at Santiago between the 27th and
31st of May?"
"Object," "object," "object," came
from each of Admiral Schtey's counsel.
Before a halt could be had the witness re
plied: "No, I don't think it was."

Ma]or Thomas N. Wood of the marine

on the Massachusetts during the Spanish
war, testified to, the circumstances con

ing the siege of Santiago. He said that
the second day after Santiago Bay was
reached by the flying squadron he had
seen the Cristobal Colon lying inside the
harbor: that there was at that time an
other Spanish vessel of the Viscaya class
partly visible. He thought both were in
view for three or four days. . The witness
also said that when Admiral Schley had
come aboard the Massachusetts previous
to the bombardment of the Colon, on May
31, he had heard that officer say to Cap
tain Higginson, "We are going in, but we
will not go in sufficiently near to endan
ger the vessels." He had been told that
the distance was to be 10,000 feet.

"Now, captain," the judge advocate
said, "I want to ask >ou, as executive
officer of the Texas, In case of the sudden
death or disability of Captain Philip who
would have, taken command of that ves
sel?"
" Captain Harber, now naval attache at
Paris and St. Petersburg, who was ex
ecutive officer on board the Texas during
the Spanish war, was asked, in the ab
sence of. Captain Philip, to give a detailed
account of the operations of that'' vessel
during the war, and ho did so. The Texas
had been a part of the flying squadron,
and the witness â¢ said that when' they
steamed for Cienfuegos the flagship had
signaled, "We go to Cienfuegos to bag
the Spaniards; wish you good luck."

HAEBER'S TESTIMONY.
.Gives Evidence on Famous Loop and
.Admiral Higginson was then excused
and Captain C. N. Chester, who command
ed the Cincinnati, and who is now in com
mand of- the naval war college at New
port, was' called.
Captain Chester related an interview
he had had with Admiral Schley on board
the Brooklyn off the south coast of Cuba
on May 20, 1S3S. He had told the admiral
that from his examination of the charts
he believed coaling feasible, but he
thought it would be done under great dis
advantages. He had expressed the opin
ion that boats might be used, or that a
more secure point might be gained under
the leas thirty miles to eastward.
Another^question put by the court was
as to the distance the squadron lay out
from Santiago, and the reply was that it
was three or four miles out during the
daytime and two or three miles Â¦ out at
night. In reply to a question he said that
after the bombardment of May 31 no fur
ther effort had been made to destroy, the
Colon because the vessel had gone inside
the harbor.
The court then withdrew its question as
to Admiral Higginson's opinion as to
whether Commodore Schley had done all
that .could be done to desfroy the Colon
while that vessel lay at anchor in San
tiago Bay. Â» /
weight of authority was against asking
the opinion of a witness.

ground that no consideration passed, and
which was sensational because of' charges
made against Attorney Henry French,
was decided in favor of the defendant by
Judge Rhodes this afternoon. The mort
gage was given to cover up the pecula
tions of Attorney Sam B. Terrill. son-in
law of Mrs. Haskell. In the trial of the
case Terrill claimed Henry French had
compounded a felony in accepting the
mortgage and had agreed not to- orose
cute him for giving a bogus mortgage.
French denied the charge and claimed no
leniency was offered Terrill. The latter Is
now serving, a four-year sentence in San

Trinity is admirably calculated for such
a meeting as the general convention with
its spacious chapel and Sunday school
rooms. These will be occupied by the
house of Bishops, which meets in secret
conclave and communicates with the
house of deputies by formal message.' The
ban of secrecy is never raised from this
section of a general convention.
The main floor of the church will be oc
cupied by the more democratic house of
Though it is a large church, Trinity is
inadequate for the congregations that
will assemble at the convention, so a ma
terial addition to its seating capacity was
necessary.
In preparation for the assembling of the
convention Trinity Church, where the
great body of churchmen are to meet, has
been transformed by the addition of gal
leries in each transept and at the west
end. To accomplish .this the organ gal
lery has been" abolished and the keyboard'
seat for the "organist transferred to the ,
chancel in front of the north arch and In
close proximity to the choir stall.

received by the heads of the California

HON. SETH LOW. president of
Columbia College, New York, is

Vicious cartooning is even worse than vicious
Â¦writing; any person can read a picture, and
the' idea of the cartoonist is made plain to the
mind of those who see it. and has more influ
ence for <*-il than the moEt vicious editorial
that could possibly be written.
The American people believe absolutely in
liberty, equality and law; in the Declaration
of Independence; in the constitution of the
United States; in the freedom of the press and
free speech ; but the time has come when this
nation must compel individuals and the press
to observe the dividing line between liberty
and license. Membership in a society con
templating the murder of those, in authority to
accomplish its objects should be made a capital
offense. The public acts of public officials
are and should be at all times subject to
public criticism either by individuals or news>
impers; but the vicious, indecent and lying
cartooning and abuse of public men must be
flopped.
In our own State â in San Francisco â we have
had a Governor winking at. and a demagogic
Mayor permitting, a rebellion that might have
been suppressed a month ago: The trades
unions owe It to themselves to see that the dis
turbing element that Becvns determined to ruin
them and to ruin the country be kept out.
"We all understand that^the trades unions are
earnest and responsible, but the anarchistic
element should be kept out of their organiza
tions. It seems that it is right for us to take
the lead, and I feel like knocking down the
man who makes a disloyal utterance; if I'm
not strong enour h to do it. I will take a club.

Some one just said that Lincoln was killed
in the heat of passion, and Gar-field by a
lunatic, but McKinley was killed by an an
archist who seems to be proud of it. That we
liave such a thing: among us as anarchy is to
be deplored, but that the press known as "yel

"Marquis Ito's achievements as Premier
of Japan in recent years are well known
to the American public and there Is little
to add to thedr Information. While trying
to introduce western improvements the
Government had to make radical changes
internally. Questions had to be settled
with regard to the abolition of the clan
system and princes and their retainers
had to be clacated. A method had to be
devised for meeting necessary expenses
"Marquis . Ito, who was not more than
thirty years old, was at that time As
sistant Minister of Finance. He came to
the United States, studied the American
financial system and upon his return to
Japan organized its finances after the
method followed In this country."

he was haunted .by the faces of the

Though he had amassed a fair compet

finally constant brooding robbed him of
reason entirely and he was sent to the
State Hospital hopelessly insane.

A. K. Coney, Consul General of Mexico.
Is honorary president.
Odd Fellows' Hall has â¢ been lavishly
decorated for the celebration. The lit
erary exercises and concert will com
mence at 8 p. m., and will be followed by
an* all-night ball. Governor Gage, Mayor
Phelan and a number Of State, Federal
and city . officials have signified their in
tention of being present at the literary
exercises over which" Consul General
Coney will preside. .
The committees having . charge of the
celebration follow:
About 1:30 o'clock, shortly after the con
clusion of the Cabinet meeting. Presi
dent Roosevelt left the "White House to
go to the residence of his sister, the wife
of Commander Cowles of the navy, for
luncheon. - Disdaining a carriage he
walked swiftly and alone. No one had
known when he would leave his office and
as he passed briskly out of the grounds
of the executive mansion he attracted
little attention, scarcely anybody recog
nizing him. He crossed Pennsylvania
avenue into Lafayette Sauare and thence
up Sixteenth street to his destination. In
the course of an hour and a half he re
turned to the White House, still alone,
and still walkinj.
The members subsequently expressed
themselves as having full confidence In
Mr. Roosevelt's ability to give thÂ« coun
try a strong and conservative administra
tion, and he win have their loyal support
to the same degree as they gave It to
the, late President, it la thought that
Tuesdays and Fridays will X* selected by
the new President as the Cabinet days,
following in this the preference of Mr.
McKinley.
Confidence in Roosevelt.
The Cabinet was in session about an
hour and a half, all of the time being
spent la a general review of the moru
Important questions which will requiro
the attention of the new President.
AH of the members were present ex
cept Attorney General Knox, who stopped
for a few days in Plttsburg. Each mem
ber explained to the President the policy
which had been followed in dealing with
the matters under consideration and their
present status.
At 11 o'clock all the members of the-
Cabinet had arrived at the White House
and soon were seated around the familiar
table. President Roosevelt occupied a
seat at Its head and in the chair long oc
cupied by his predecessor. The gloom
and solemnity which characterized the
meeting was not unbefitting the occasion.
Is eany all the members of the present
Cabinet are quite sure to remain during
Mr. Roosevelt's term, but It 13 very prob
able that Secretary Long will retire with
in the next few months. He feels that
ne can resign without embarrassment to
Mr. Roosevelt and therefore it Is thought
that he will, during the next few montha.
ask the President to permit him to enter,
private life.

LONDON, Sept 20.â Lord Kitchener, re
ports that the Boers have captured a
company of mounted infantry and two
guns at Vlakfontein. One officer was
killed. The Boers in superior force sur
rounded the British. Lord Kitchener is
making a strict Investigation and has sent
columns of troops in pursuit of the Boers.
The Gazette this afternoon announces
that on the disbandment of Lord Strath
cona's Canadian corps twenty-nine officers
have been granted honorary rank in the
British army corresponding with their
present rank. The list commences with
the name of Lieutenant Colonel Steele,
the commander of Strathcona's norse In
South Africa, who becomes an honorary
lieutenant colonel in the regular army.
The succession of "regrettable Inci
dents" which Lord Kitchener has report
ed has evoked editorial counsels to . the
Government to cease to endeavor to wage
war by proclamation and to recognize the
need of crushing the Boers by force of
arms. â¢ Â¦ L~ ' Â¦

Clavering brings news of a battle that
took place early In September at the city
of Chimo, China, between Chinese troops
and 40,000 natives, who were determined
not to pay the indemnity taxes recently
levied. The populace decided that the
new taxation waa too heavy and asked
for a reduction. The mandarin of Chimo
declined to comply. An ultimatum was
sent to him to the effect that if he did
not make the desired reductions the pe
ple of the surrounding country would
storm the city. The mandarin made great
preparations for defense, fortifying the
gates of the city with plank and stone
and posting all the soldiers at his,com

. D. SHEPPARD, general freight
A agent of the Southern Pacific
/ j\ Company, has sent in his res
/[\\ Q lgnation. He has severed his
connection with the Southern
Pacific for all time and will henceforth
be connected with the Pacific Improve
ment Company. About the first of next
month he will leave for Victoria and In
that city represent his new employers in
the capacity of resident manager.
Sheppard's resignation follows recent
changes in the management of the road,
as The Call predicted a few weeks ago.
When C. H. Markham, who was formerly
general freight agent at Portland, was
elevated to the position of assistant to
Freight Traffic Manager William Sproule
the "word went round the yellow building"
that Sheppard's days were numbered. At
that time Sheppard was deep in negotia
tions with the Pacific Improvement Com
pany. He knew that with the change of
proprietorship in the Southern Pacific
Company many upheavals would occur,
and he began at an early date to make
sure of a safer and better berth. The
change is a more desirable one both from
. Mr. Sheppard will leave for Victoria in
a few weeks. His family will go with him;
a question that is Riving the .freight men
of the Southern Pacific more than ordin
ary concern. The next in succession is
'"Billy" Luce, assistant general passenger
and freight agent at Los Angeles, but it
Is not likely that he will step into Shep
pard's shoes. It is "more than probable
that the position will go unfilled. Since
his advent into the yellow building Mark
ham has been nothing more than an as
sistant to Snroule, without the duties or
the powers of the general freight agent,
which position he occupied only in a rank
ing capacity.
The new regime of the Southern Pacific
has not yet done with its work. In the
words of one of the local officers the ax
Is still swinging. The old men feel that
the work of years has counted for noth
ing and the present and the future is all
they are looking to. It seems that with
the resignation of Hays there will be no
immediate succession even to his office.
With a general traffic manager looking
out for the interests of all the Harrlman
syndicate roads the presidents, such as
Hays of the Southern Pacific and Burt
of the Union Pacific, are mere figureheads.
The general manager of the operating
departments assumes practical control un
der this new order of things.
The Pacific Improvement Company has
large â¢ interests in lands and. railways in
Victoria. Who will succeed Sheppard is
the financial and personal side, according
to Sheppard's own declaration.
"When the Harrlman syndicate obtained
control of the Southern Pacific we knew
that the tenure of the service of the old
men would be uncertain," said Sheppard
yesterday. "The men who have been
with the company ior years and seen its
steady development were all. placed In a
precarious condition as far as their posi
tions went. The Pacific Improvement
Company represents Stanford, Crocker,
Hopkins and Huntingdon interests, for
whom I have been working for many
years. Shortly after Harriman stepped
in my negotiations began with the Pacific
Improvement Company, but they were
not crystallized until this week."
Dr. Tamayo, Cuban Secretary of State,
and Perfecto LaCosta, Secretary of Agri
culture, who represented Cuba at the Mc-
Kinley obsequies, returned to Havana this
afternoon, carrying wiih them the assur
ances of the President's kindly disposition
toward their land and his purpose to ob
serve the policy inaugurated by his pre
decessor. -
General Wood saw the President for a
few minutes after the meeting of the Cab
inet, part of the time participating in a,
discussion between the President and Mr.
Koot, who remained after the other mem
bers of the Cabinet had gone. General
Wood's conversation with the President
was personal in character, and he will
officially discuss Cuban affairs with him
lo-mcrrow.
Secretary Roct left Washington for
New York this afternoon, and General
Wood accompanied him as far as Balti
more. This latter conference was devoted
to a consideration of the election law
which has been enacted by the Constitu
tional Convention. The oojectionable pro
vision of the law is that requiring elec
tions at six different times in the year.
which it is feared will keep the island in
constant political turmoil. Whether the
United States will urge any changes or
net in the law will depend upon the talk
the President and General Wood will have
to-morrow and the views of Mr. Root
upon his return.
Wood Visits Roosevelt.
"The Call can say positively, a mem
ber of the Cabinet said after the adjourn
ment of that body, "that President
Roosevelt does not propose to place any
obstacles in the way ot Cuban independ
ence. It is his purpose to observe the
policy formulated by Mr. McKinley, and
it is his expectation that American with
orawai from the island will occur lafe
next spring." i
This report of the view of the Presi
dent is substantiated by a decision ren
dered this afternoon by Secretary Root
on the question of making changes in the
present Cuban tariff. Colonel Edwards,
chief of the insular division of the War
Department, had received recommenda
tions of the Tariff Commission which has
been sitting in Havana. The Secretary de
cided that in his view of the short time
intervening before the Cubans assume
control of their own affairs, it is not wise
to put into force a new tariff involving
many important changes. The Secretary
Â¦will authorize General Wood to issue a
military order making changes only In
tho^e tariff rates which have especially
Â¦worked hardship. The Cubans will thus
be perfectly free to prepare and put into
effect their own tariff the moment they
assume charge of the government.
Good News for Cubans.

FOE, DUCKS AND QUAIL
Perry Queenan of Chicago was given tha
decision over Jack Kane of this city last
night after their fifteen-round boxing bout
at the' Reliance Club, Oakland. The deci
sion of Referee E. J. Smith was not popu
lar. The spectators thought Kane per
formed as well as the winner and that a
draw would have done nei-.her man an in
justice. . The fight was fast from start to
tlnish, each man trying his gest.
â¢ Kane was the aggressor up to the sixth
round of the nght, when he gave way to
Queenan after a heavy j:>lt on the jaw
during a fierce scrimmage. Queenan land
ed a wicked right frequently on Kane's
body- -He delivered, these blows until tha
last few rounds of the fight, -when he grew
too weak to direct them. Kane aimed for
the face and neck and jolted his opponent
often with short-arm blows. Many of his
wicked attempts to land a. knock-out feu
short or went over Queenan'a head.
Kane had the best of the twelfth anrl
thirteenth and in the latter it looked as
though he had his man going. Queenan
recuperated before the iourteenth and
came back strong. In the fourteenth the
men roughed It considerably and Kane
seemed. to be weakening. The call of timo
was a welcome signal to both men. The
crowd called for a. draw, but Referee
Smith, decided for Queenan.
The preliminaries resulted in a decision
for McDonald over Dolan in a six-round
go and for Capeliss over Martin in a ten
round bout.
Bay City Club Boxing Bouts,
Kid Parker did not last one round In
his fight last night with Joe "Welch In
the Mechanics* Pavilion Annex. He was
knocked down three times and. then went
out. When he recovered his . scattered
senses some minutes later he wanted to
fight his seconds and the spectators who
crowded around the rtagr. He was doused
with cold water and gently led from the
scene of his defeat. This bout was sub
stituted for the X>anziger-Howard affair.
The first bout was between Barney
Driscoll and Dick Cullen. Driscoll won on
points.
Fred Landers and Ed Smith, -were the
next pair to hook up. Smith looked a
small edition. of Tom Sbarkey. He lasted
two rounds, when Landere dropped him
with a right to the jaw. He recovered
slowly. At this point Sergeant of Police
O'Connor stopped the proceedings.
Bob Johnson and Geor?e White boxed
gently for a time and then settled down
to hard fighting. The referee called. It a
draw.
James Cronley and Joe Angell furnished
the amusement of the evening. Neither
could box so they wrestled all over the
ring.
Jack Hadlcan used Eel Jackson as a
punching bag. After haJf a round the
police stopped the uneaual contest.
Frank George and Tony Everett boxed
four stiff rounds to a draw.
The affair was tinder the direction of
the Bay City Athletic Club. James Mc-

Notes of the Game.
BERKELEY, Sept. 20.â The university
band and the rooters livened up things at
football practice this afternoon and gave
the struggling men on the gridiron a sam
ple of the enthusiastic student support
they are to receive throughout the sea
son. A vast quantity of noise was made
by the rooters on the bleachers duripg the
progress of practice,' and the band,, lo
cated in their midst, broke out into mel
ody when the occasion required. Speeches
were made and the yell leader, In keeping
the college spirit on the wing, worked
harder than a second eleven man with
varsity hopes. â¢ - Â¦
Leroy Smith, the new leader or . the.
noisy bunch, is getting his squad in fine
trim for the coming contests, and Jt ought
certainly to swamp any opposing aggrega
tion under a deluge of sound.
Two elevens were opposed against each
other this afternoon for the commence
ment of hard practice. The line-ups were
changed often, but they brought in the
old varsity men and the promising candi
dates for thfi freshman team. A practice
game will be played early next week be
tween tho freshmen and the Berkeley
High School eleven; The flrtst freshman
game will take place on the campus Octo
her 2 against 8t, Matthew's School, ,

READVILLE, Mass., Sept. 20.â Eight
thousand people saw Lord Derby defeat
Thomas V/. Lawson's Boralma without
apparent effort this afternoon in straight
heats. The Lawson horse seemed utterly
outclassed and unable to hold Lord Derby
in the home stretch and in the last two
heats he was eased up.
The time, considering the heavy wind
that blew up the back stretch and met
the horses for a full half-mile, was re
markably fast. In two of the heats Bor
alma led until within 200 yards of the wire.
Lord Derby was driven in masterly fash-.
Ion by the veteran Geerg, who was warm
ly applauded at the conclusion of the
race. Summary: 'Â¦'Â¦/Â¦Â¦

THE most important race of the
year between trotters, and one of
the most important ever ar
ranged, will be. decided to-day -at
Readvilie, Mass., between Cres
ceus, hailed King of Trotters, and The
Abbot The horses are to race for a purse
of $20,000, offered by Thomas W. Lawson,
the millionaire sportsman of Boston. The
gate receipts will be devoted to charity. â¢
The race has been pending for several
weeks Each horse has trotted sensa
tional races, and the outcome is in doubt,
although Cresceus is the favorite.
The last time the two great horses met
The Abbot was not in condition, and Ed
Geers, his driver, was humiliated by hav
ing the distance flag waved in his face as
he finished. He. has tried unceasingly
since then for a return match and now
proclaims himself ready for the Issue.' His
horse is said to be working miles in 2:05
with the greatest ease. This .means, if
track and weather conditions prove fa
vorable, the time hung out after the race
will press two minutes closely.
Cresceus is a bulldog finisher, as was
shown in his last quarter mile in i :29% sec
onds some days since. This is the fastest
last quarter ever trotted in a race.

The fanatics who journeyed to Recrea
tion grounds yesterday afternoon were
treated to a new kind of baseballâ a con
test in -which the members of the Oakland
club strived to outdo one another in pil
ing up errors and sending their opponents
across the plate. In this respect "Mother"
Lohman was first, with four misplays to
his credit, while "Kid" Mohler and Ar
rellanes were tied for second place, each
making three. The rest of the team, with
the exception of Drennan, Schmidt and
Streib, were also in the running, and
might possibly have done as bad as Peter
or: the "Kid" had the opportunity present
ed, itself. The Dudes certainly put up the
mostlwretchjed-exhibition of the national
game seen on a California diamond - in
years, some, of their plays being rank
enough to make a schoolgirl weep. **'
The farce opened with fair prospects of
a food Â£amÂ«. Oakland made one run in
the third by means of hits by Hanson and
Schmidt. The Germans tied the score in
their half of the lourth, when Schwartz
beat, a bunt, got to third on an out and
an error and came home on a wild pitch.
The score stood two to one in favor of
the Dudes when the seventh round was
reached. ' In ; thls Inning the. Dudes went
up in gthe air, 1 and stayed there until the
end. Errors came so fast that it was
nearly to keep track of them,
and Schmidt, who up to this time had
been pitching great ball, began to get dis
heartened. He did; not make an attempt
to win, \ and when the end came eleven
safe â¢ ones were } scored against him.
Schmidt?is a splendid pitcherâ as good as
there is in the league. He has good speed
and control and is also a hitter. With
proper: support he should prove a tower
of strength to Ewing's cripples.
When the agony of the last three rounds
was over it was found that the Dutch had
twelve runs and eleven hits to their cred
it, to six -.and ten made by the Benedicts.
Frisco therefore got the game, but it
should be "no contest" and rain
checks given to the unfortunates who
paid theirrgood money for, the privilege of
suffering through the game. The score: .
This is Elks' day at the track, all mem
bers of that order and their lady friends
being admitted free at the gate. The en

The Gcflden Gate race : meeting was re-
Burned at Oakland track yesterday before
the usual big crowd. For a time it Jooked
as if the gentlemen drivers participating
in the race few members of the Golden
Gate Park Driving Club intended â¢ making
a six-day go-as-you-please affair of it, as
seven heats were reeled off before Durfee
Me was returned winner. It was a "very
choppy little extravaganza, but it is bare
lv possible that it takes gentlemen riders
longer to get thÂ«ir money set. However,
six running events were sandwiched in
between heats. aTid notwithstanding the
long programme the people were landed
home in time to answer the dinner gong.
Among the winners of the runs Bob Palm
er Etta H and Sir Hampton furnished
mild surprises, -while Royalty. Mike
Strauss and Gusto rewarded the patience
of favorite followers.
It would tak2 a -searcher of records to
tell which was the real favorite for the
harness number. Of course, there was
heat betting, and the gentlemen drivers,
and their friends made fewer mistakes
than did the horses. A. Joseph behind
Durfee Me sat as still as the lone fisher
man for thres heats, then he took the
fourth, sixth and seventh- heats. Abdine
earned second money .. and . Imp, over
which Charles E. Parks held the ribbons,
third money.
Undoubtedly the best of the running,
events Â¦was the six-furlong handicap, cap
tared by Sir Hampton, carrying 112 pounds
and excellently ridden by "Chub" Kussell.
As good as 4 to 1 was laid about George
Miller's horse, which came from last post- ;
tion in the stretch, beating Sir Dougala;
length. Meehaaus, the 3 to 5 favorite, cut
off by Huachuca about three furlongs
from the stand, finished third.
Bob Palmer, a 6 to 1 shot, piloted by
Bansch, downed the good thing Pidalia
in the seven-furlong run, passing the
black horse the last furlong. San Augus
tine, the favorite, ran unplaced.
J. McCarthy failed to infuse vigor
enough into his riding, and Almoner, the
even money favorite for the" five-furlong
sprint, was shown the way out by Etta
H. The old mare looked very high in
flesh after her long vacation, but did not
have to cut out a very fast clip. Foucon
got Howard in third at 10 to L
The two top weights. Royalty and Pari
zade, had the two-year-old handicap, over
five and a half furlongs, to themselves,
the others beins outclassed. The former,
with Ruiz in the saddle, had first call in
the ring at even money. Russell took
Partzade out in front, but the. filly tired
from the paddock in and lost by less than
a length, with Evea G a close third.
Luck finally changed, and Frank Weir
drew down a purse with Mike Strauss.
The brown gelding was sent to the post
favorite for the sixth race and scored
somewhat handily from Mike Rice. Dug
gan on Kitty Kelly, the second choice,
Â¦ ran into the show. Mamie Hildreth made
a most indifferent showing.
To all appearances outclassing the other
ptarters in the concluding dash over the
Futurity course. Gusto helped himself to
the first position and Ransch Kept him
there. J. F. Woods astride Clarando led
out First Shot ior place honors.

Passengers on Nippon Maru Watch
a Thrasher Kill a Whale.
The passengers on the Toyo Kisen Kai
sha's Nippon Maru, which arrived from
the Orient Thursday morning, witnessed
a scene they will never forget. A heavy
fog hung over the ocean and the Faral
lones loomed vp on the port bow. Be
tween the mail boat and the lightship was
a great patch of foam, and almost on the
instant that the lookout reported it the
captain made it out to be a thrasher and
a whale in deadly combat. All hands were
called, and when the cabin passengers
gathered on tbe deck they witnessed a
strange spectacle. An enormous whale;
accompanied by her two baby whales, was
lashing the sea into foam In its efforts to
escape the thrasher. The thrasher would
drive the young mammals away with a
rush and would then leap into the air and
come down with a whack on ths mother
wfiale. The whale would not sound and
thus leave its young unprotected. Time
after time the thrasher drove the babies

thrasher proceeded to eat Its tongue, and
after that feast started in to thrash the

BY FAR THE MOST FREQUENT CAUSE
of nervous disorders of the male is .
A Damaged Prostate Gland
The Prostate Gland (so-caJled neck of blad-

ihÂ»> terminations of these nerves are kept in a.
constant state of excitement by chronic In-
flammatory processes it appears very clear
that by (ransmifcsicn of this irritation to other
nerves thc patient may.be subject to nervous
phenomena of the most varied character. Pre-

I CRITICISM OF THE CALL. I
In the Wasp this morning appears the
following editorial comment in reference
to The Call: - \

In San Francisco, and one of the
greatest ln the Unllted States. It

the family Journal pur excellence of
the Pacific Coast. Reliability is its
mottoâ "Be cure you're rlffht then

pense in getting the news and is al
ways thoroughly np i|o date in all its
departments. Â¦ Its pli-torlal features
are a. revelation of vrhat can be ac
complished in illustrated dally jour,
nalism. ylt not only employs the
best artists in thÂ« country, ' but
achieves the niore <tlifflenlt feat of
printing their worlc so admirably
that the beauty of The Call's en-
Srravlngs are tbe i wonder of tbe
-world of art. If any one department
of The Call is more deserving of spe
cial notice than another, it is ', its
editorial department. Tbe Call's
editorials are masterpieces and ex
press in no. dubious terms the opin
ions of the journal. On great public
Questions Tbe Call speaks in no un
certain tones. .This llias been partic
ularly , noticeable daring the long
strike in San Francisco. The Call
has come out boldly; for law and or
der, condemning? t)Â»e attempts to
create anarchy that find expression
ln brutal assaults on non-union men
who dÂ«re ( to take pliicen vacated by
the strikers. This independent
course had added much to The Call's
influence among the lair-abiding
people' tot the State.

A California automobillst walked Into

can.
"You may want it for. somebody else:
besides, we don't have tags like that in
"Frisco," he said, as he returned the talis
man entitling him to use the Park drives.
"Such consideration is unusual," said
Secretary Martin. "Out of about 400 num
bers issued to automobile riders to us*
the park drives, many are held by non
residents. In Reading and other cities
residents have numbers, so that they can
pass through the park when visitins
Philadelphia." .
WANTON criticism of Presidents Is no new thing.
But only in these later years has it led to results so
deplorable.' Whether insane or an anarchist, there
is unquestionably a connection between the shoot
ing of "William McKinley ' by Czolgosz and the
defamations of the yellow journals. Says Dr. Allen McLane
Hamilton, professor of' mental diseases in the medical college
of Cornell University: "No one except a physician who sees
much of insanity or persons whose mental condition is. doubted,
can appreciate the Influence of the present distorted, public
sense of decency. This is manifested by a lawlessness which
finds expression* in some of the public prints and in the delib
eration of societies instituted for the relief of the oppressed.
This literature and these societies are usually a menace to law
and order in putting into the heads of half -cracked people per
nicious . ideas which they almost immediately act upon." Dr.
Hamilton says that there have come to his notice lately,
numerous cases of disturbed mental states which were duÂ«
directly to such influences. Only a few weeks ago a man
went to him N with a number of newspaper clippings of an in
cendiary nature, and after showing them announced his in
tention, of killing several. prominent persons, among them be
ing J. Pierpont Morgan and Senator. Hanna.
The Chicago Journal, in an editorial on "The Yellow Press
and Anarchy," says: "If what Hearst's newspapers have said,
printed and portrayed about President McKinley were true,
be was not fit to live, much less to rule. * â¢ â¢ They could
not have made more scandalous, more bitter or more degrad
ing, charges against the greatest scoundrel on earth." And
John Most, the -leader of the anarchists, says to the police as
he repudiates Czolgosz: "You wish to make this man one of
us Why don't you read the New York Journal? Look at the
caricatures on the last pages, where your President is por
trayed in a way that would make even a bootblack ashamed."
"What~ wonder, then, that Czolgosz should get it into his
brain to put President McKinley but of the way after reading
the articles defaming him either In the- Hearst papers or in
some just as disreputable! It is with extreme sorrow that
The Pacific sees the pernicious influence of such papers. It
seems strange that a man of such life-long advantages as W.
Ji. Hearst should give himself to that which is so generally
regarded as one of the basest uses of talent and wealth. It is
The Pacific.
Let us hope that in this experience yellow Journalism may
receive a lesson which will tend to its profit and purification.
. In the presence of such journalism The Pacific can not re
main silent. "We dare not let it pass unnoticed and unrebuked.
The San Francisco Call and the Bulletin have spoken plainly,
but these are daily rivals of one of Hearst's papers, and aa
such their utterances might be discounted, in some circles. Tha
readers of. The -Pacific will not question, our motive nor dis
count what we say. The present writer, recognizing- the great
influence of the press,, devoted himself at the close of his col
lege life twenty years ago to journalism. "We have no less ani
estimate to-day of that Influence. It molds thought and Yf.Jk
far more than most people are aware: and we tremble for tha
welfare of the nation when we think of some of the hands
into which It has fallen. "We were glad to read in the news
papers of this city extracts from -recent sermons by ministers
denouncing yellow journalism, but not one named any paper
as such, and it is a singular fact that some' of those denuncia
tions were printed in the very paper at which they were
hurled. It would seem that there are publishers -whose moral
judgments are so conditioned that they are unaware of thÂ»
fact that they are issuing such pernicious papers. Or else, in
tho hour when the thunder and lightning of wrath is playing.
they seek by the publication of the denunciatory utterances to
protect themselves from its strokes.
But as we read there is constantly before the eyes that
printed cartoon In which McKinley is pictured as applauding
the trusts, which are represented as riding down, in an auto
mobile, the common people. . â¢ Â¦
with astonishment that we compare what is said and printed
in his papers since McKinley was stricken down with what was
said; and portrayed previous to that time. And all -without
any * admission of previous mistake or injustice. In one of
these papers it is said: "To "William McKinley was intrusted
the care of a nation, .great, powerful, self-sufficient, free from
dangers and turnroil. His duty was to guide the great machine
honestly,' cautiously, according to the will of the people. . He
did his duty and he died at his* post. â¢ â¢ â¢ His life was com
plete. The nation for which he worked he leaves powerful and
prosperous. â¢ â¢ â¢ He knew that in the land where millions
had opposed and disagreed with him politically not one was
free from deep sorrow, not one but felt the national calamity
as a personal loss."

heart has been profoundly touched by the murder of
the President. That great . crime Vests upon such
foundation of the myriad of lesser crimes committed
in this city. The highway can never be safe for the
President unless it is also safe for the humblest citi- '
zen while in pursuit of his lawful "purpose and occu
pation.
Organizations of our. most respectable and respon
sible taxpayers and business men have asked' Mayor
Phelan and Governor Gage to enforce the law and
stop these murderous assaults, which in number now
run into the thousands, and have been answered by
shifty evasions which in a year from now will be gen
erally execrated as evidences of cowardice.
How long will the spectacle abuse our patience?
How long will the Sheriff of Contra Costa. County
ftvait on the Supervisors who refuse to give him a
force that can protect the loading of wheat at Port
Costa before he throws the responsibility upon the
Governor by confessing that he is powerless to en
force the law? How long will th^Mayor of this
city and the Sheriff of this county permit murder and*
HOW long will public patience endure the con
dition of affairs in this city, and along the
lines of travel that reach it?
Practical immunity from punishment has so em
boldened the strikers that they no longer take pains
to identify the men whom they rob and attempt to
murder. Peaceful travelers who are not coming here
as laborers, but are business men, are attacked by
gangs of cowardly ruffians on trains and ferry-boats,
and not only grossly insulted and beaten, but robbed,
and are helpless to resist or protect themselves
against the overpowering number of their armed as
sailants. Such travelers have been pulled out of their
berths on sleeping cars, humiliated and roughly
handled, on suspicion that they were coming as
strike-breakers, and some, if permitted to reach the
ferry-boats in peace, have been met on board and
beaten brutally.
For a time a man took his life in' his hands only
when he walked the streets of this American city,
where men are maimed, murdered or robbed with
impunity by strikers, regardless of whether they are
non-union workmen or not. But now the death pen
alty is put upon such as choose to approach San
Francisco on the highways of travel. Do the lawful
authorities know the somber significance of all this?
Do they know that it is permanently injuring the
prosperity and good name and fame of San- Fran
cisco? Do they know that men are everywhere con
cluding that this city is under the thumb of thugs and
thieves? - '
Is there no law to protect men against these open,
defiant, murder-intending and death-inflicting mis
creants? They are a small minority of our people,
they are even a minority, of our laboring population,
but they h2ve been emboldened by the lawlessness of
the minor courts, the criminal neglect of duty by
police magistrates and the silence of the Mayor, until
they have suspended the civil law, removed all pro
tection of personal rights, and set up a bloody
despotism with murder as its object. We speak
plainly, for the emergency requires it. The public

The Philadelphia â¢ Inquirer has pointed but the moral for the whole people in these
emphatic words: "And let it not be. forgotten that anarchy and yellow journalism are one."
The Stockton Independent quotes an editorial; of the New York Journal saying:
"Do you doubt that Mark Hanna, acting for McKinley, will increase the army, and, if oc
casion arise, use it against organized labor, which he so much hates?" Of that and much
more of a similar kind the Independent says: "It is the stupid, sodden, unreasoning, irre
ligious and irresponsible mind that is fired to hatred; disorder, treason and crime by
these utterances. As a class these degenerates are in greater proportion in New York
than elsewhere, so Hearst's paper has an easier field for crime than its equally guilty con
temporaries that have- used- the same arguments, repeated the same lies and imitated the
same methods." * -'-.Â¦
V These quotations from. the. press of all parts of the country will suffice for to-day.
We present them in order that our readers -may be made a^are of the extent and the
depth of the feeling that has arisen against the yellow, Journals. As the Alameda Argus
has said: "We must not think that Hearstism is an affliction; peculiar to /California. ".- It
; is known all over the country and people every wtiere are turning to drub it."/
â¢ The Santa Cruz Sentinel was threatened with a loss of subscribers because it
pointed out the responsibility of yellow journalism for the crime ; of Czolgosz, but no
such loss occurred, and in commenting unpn the threat the Sentinel says: "The anony
mous communication read as if it was written in the interest of the Examiner and sent to
us as a bluff. This is a bad season of public sentiment to run a bluff on 'any one or any
thing in the interest of anarchy. With a President dead, and a people exasperated, this is
a good time for the champions of disorder to hide beneath thistles."
The Nordhoff Ojai: "It appears that one bright reflection from the crime at Buf
falo is the probable downfall of yellow journalism and in particular the tabooing of Wil
liam. R. Hearst's triangleof infamy,, the Journal-American-Examiner. Hearst- was hanged
in effigy at Hanford, and from all parts of the State are reported excoriations of the Ex
iner by the press and pulpit. Hearst's Eastern semi-anarchist organs are likewise being
exposed to the withering heat of indignant public opinion."
The San Jose Herald takes a' similar view of the present course pursued by the yel
low journals, and says of the one in this city: "What does the Examiner know of conscience
or political policy? Its present attitude is even meaner than its abuse and crocodile
tears." Â¦Â¦â¢ Â¦â¢â¢Â¦{'â¢ . '- "'->:
The Tacoma Ledger notes the statement. of the Examiner that it does not reply to
the charges brought against it and its allies by the indignant public because, "The Ex
iner has too deep and sincere a respect for the President" to -reply now, and makes the
pertinent comment: "The papers attacked should have been ready with a rejoinder. Jt is
weak for them to make such a plea as they are trying to hide behind. They have never
shown any respect for Mr. McKinley, have slandered him freely, have deliberately mis
construed his righteous acts, and now the profession of sorrow strikes the judgment as
being a grotesque and pitiful pretext." ~" Â¦ . (
Such, expressions show the temper of the press and the -people of the East and
the South. A similar tone prevails here. The patriotic press along the entire Pacific
Coast has spoken out manfully against the Hearst papers with special , reference to the
Examiner. . -;\ . .
The Nashville American quotes from the New York Journal this statement made
after the assassination: ''The old-established Presidential custom of receiving all citizens
and treating all comers as worthy of confidence and friendly greeting must be aban
doned. * * â¢ * The times prove that humanity in this country is no longer univer
sally worthy of the confidence which the handshaking custom implies." Thereupon the
American adds: "If such a condition as the Journal asserts really exist, and we do not
deny that it does, such yellow newspapers as the New York Journal have contributed
their full share to the existence of such conditions. * \* * No intelligent, decent,
healthy minded man can have any respect for such a paper, as the New York Journal."
The Chicago Journal says: "The Journal has no hesitation in pointing out where
the real responsibility rests for the crime against the President. The yellow and irre
sponsible press of the country by their degrading and malicious attacks on public officers
and men in high places have fostered discontent, have promoted anarchy and have made
possible just such crimes."
The New York Press quotes the words of Emma Goldman when arrested: "Why
should any one wish to kill McKinley? He is the most insignificant President the United
States ever had." And adds: "There is but one source on earth from which this woman
could have gathered this estimate of this man. It is in the editorial pages of the New
York Journal and its allied publications in Chicago and San Francisco/' -
The Albany Evening Journal asks the pertinent question: "Who is the greater crim
inal â the man of superior intelligence who insidiously incites to murder, or the ignorant,
perhaps weak-minded, one who, urged on by incendiary speeches and writings, goes forth
to do the killing?"
The Bridgeport Standard sojiiids JtKis} warning -r : --"The ; murdCT.6f'"a,P>esjdaai^jslfiut
the first fruits of that sort of pabulum thrown broadcast among ; the people; the other
logical consequences will be general murder, riot and rapine. And law and decency stand
supinely by: and allow this deadly work without \a protest. * * ]* ] Only the madness
of the anarchist, inflamed by the promptings of dirty journalists who seek for gain in the
gutters of political warfare and incite the desperate to. murder, can be found to account
for this most infamous crime." â¢ â¢
The New Haven Leader says: "The excesses and indecencies of New York yel
low journalism have often arousedthe disgust and abhorrence. oÂ£ decent, people, but now
it has so aroused their indignation that there is cause for belief that radical' and effective
action will be taken. Just now these yellow .-.journals are loading, their . columns with
praise of President McKinley. * They are doing; this with the smirk of the hypocrite and
the impulse of the coward. * * * Let no one forget, /however, that President Mc-
Kinley has ior years been denounced and vilified by. these yellow anarchists." Â¦
The New York Independent says: "Behind these little groups of anarchists, the
John Schwabs and the Emma Goldman's, behind the Paterson,; or Chicago, or. Detroit
conspirators, stand those other infamous 'slanderers of, the Government and rulers that
make it their business and trade to inflame the public mind. * * * To them we must
look for the accursed inspiration that struck down the President. They are not to be
laughed at, not to be taken lightly, but with indignation. We doubt not. that Senator
Hanna is in the same danger of assassination as was President AlcKinley, and if he should
be shot it will be the yellow journals that are to blame.: But what care they?; The
murder of a President sells editions." . Â¦ , Â¦ \ c .

RARELY has there been a sentiment, so well nigh universal among the people and
' the press of the IJnited States as that which now holds the Hearst newspapers re
sponsible for the spirit of anarchy that led to the assassination of President Mc-
Kinley. In the mourning for the illustrious dead * there glows a deep wrath
against the yellow journalism that fostered the crime. . The feeling "could not be repressed
even in the solemn ceremonies ofi Thursday, and from the lips of almost every orator
of the day throughout the land there came well understood words of condemnation
against the vicious papers which, after having long defiled the profession of journalism,
have now brought about a crime at which the" world stands aghast. -

Shortly after midnight Thursday Police
man William Casey saw two drunken
hoodlums tearing down the mourning
drapery and flags on the front of O'Con
nell's grocery, at the corner of Twenty
fourth and Hampshire streets. On the ap
proach of the officer they fled. He pur
sued them and fired a shot into the air.
The hoodlums escaped for the time being,
but after a half-hour's search' Casey
found them on Twenty-third street and
arrested them for malicious mischief
Their names are Charles McLaughlin and
Joseph Kenny. When they appeared be
fore Judge Conlan yesterday they pleaded
guilty and were ordered to appear for sen
tence this morning. -
Sydney Bennett, the young Australian,
who was arrested Thursday morning for
tearing down a picture of the late Presi
dent from in front of the residence of
Mrs. Amy Julius, at 13 Polk, street, was
convicted by Judge Fritz yesterday on
the charge of malicious mischief and was
sentenced to six months' imprisonment in
the County Jail.
The sentence of six months' imprison
ment imposed upon two Mission hoodlums
by Judge Conlan on Tuesday for tearing
down a picture of the martyred President
did not have the effect of stopping simi
lar acts of vandalism.

There were also rumors to the effect
that Ottinger was organizing a trust of
ticket brokers on the coast. This Ot
tinger stoutly denies. He says the mat
ter never came under his consideration.
Ticket-Broker for Twenty Years and
Highly Thought Of by Bail

An anonymous circular Â¦was sent last
month from St. Louis to all the prom
inent railroad officials and ticket brokers
of the United States stating that A. Ot
tinger of this city was working hand and
glove with the Southern Pacific to the
detriment of the other ticket brokers. -
There appears to be no ground for the
charge and an injustice has been done
Ottinger. He stands in high esteem in
railroad circles and has been a ticket
broker In this city for the past twenty
years.

This week's News Letter is an unusual
ly handsome number.: It contains as a
frontispiece a splendid portrait of. the late
President McKinley, with beautiful I son
nets : to ' his memory by Wallace Irwin.
The editorials keep up -their, fearless tone
and deal with live questions in a masterly
manner, and the Town. Crier fairly, bris
tles with satire. Lady Algy, in "Bubbles
From the Swim," relates much, interest
ing gossip about the smart set, while Mrs.
Chauncey de Wit devotes a good deal of
her space to widows who >take the second
[matrimonial plunge. The Looker On-de-
I partment is even better than^ usual and
contains interesting anecdotes of our late
President. Robert. McTavishr has a string
of very. amusing advice to young wives.

It has been suggested by a financial au
thority, whose position gives his views
particular weight, that the ultimate end
of the cpmmunity of interest plan would
undoubtedly be the establishment of sep
arate financial companies controlled Â¦ by
ownership of securities of each of the
great groups of railroads.
It is evident, therefore, "that the plan
of control can in no measure be account
ed as an accomplished fact, but the in
formation given is important as. indicat
ing the general drift in the coming com
munity of interest plan in railroad op
erating. The formation of a new security
holding company i:-? not, of course, a novel
situation in the railroad world. It will be
on the same general plan as that of tho
Pennsylvania Company, which was char
tered by the Legislature of Pennsylvania
April 8. 1870, for the purchase and man
aging the interests of Pennsylvania com
panies and the railroads leased and con
trolled by that company west of Pittsburg.
The stock of the Pennsylvania company
is owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad.
William K. Vanderbilt has given con
siderable study to the practical consolida
tion of the lines proposed and at his dug
gestion Edward V. Rossiter, treasurer of
the New York Central, and H. Mac-
Twombley, a director, whose opinion Is
paiticularly valuable to Vanderbilt, have
been for some, time at work on a skeleton
plan. When this has received Vanderbilt's
approval it will be then worked out in
greater detail and placed formally before
the board of directors. â¢ . \
NEW YORK, Sept". 20.â The Journal of
Commerce says: It has been learned from
an authoritative source that plans for the
practical consolidation ajid direction of
the entire Vanderbilt system of railroads
are in course of preparation. These plans
include the formation- of a. new parent
company.. It will be entirely a financial
company and will be the holder of stock
of the subsidiary companies. ,No name
has yet, been secured for the proposed
parent company, but the "New York Cen
tral Company" seems to be that most
generally favored.

A NOTED PHYSiCIAN,
Doctor Wanata; of Lansing, Mich.,
Says There is; Nothing- in the Materia Medica.thai;
Equals Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
, poiind for the (Jure of Womatfs Ills.
a Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â The honest, intelligent physician is above
the ' School.' Whatever is best in each case should be used, no matter
to what school a physician belongs. J, as a matter of conscience, can
only prescribe the best, and as I know and have provrn that there" is
nothing in Materia Medica which equals Lydia E.Ptnkhani's Vege-
table Compound in severe cases of female disorders, I unhesitatingly
prescribe it, and have never yet been sorry.
"I know of nothing better for ovarian troubles and for falling ol
the womb or ulcerations; it absolutely restores the atfeeted parts to
their normal condition quicker and better than anything else. I have
known it to cure. barrenness in women, who to-day are happy mothers
of children, and while the medical profession looks down upon 4 patents,'
I have learned, instead, to look-up to the healing lotion, by whatever
name it be known. If my fellow physicians dared tell the truth, hundreds
of them would voice my sentiments."â Dr. .Wanata, Lansing, Mich.
;dr.\vanata\ n
As Dr. ."Janata says, if physiciivns dared to be frank and openi, hun.
dreds of them would acknowledge that they constantly prescribe Lydia
E. Pinkliam's Vegetable Compound in severe cases of female ills, as
they know by experience that it can be relied upon to effect a cure.
Women who are troubled, with painful or irregular menstruation,
backache, bloating (or flatulence); leucorrhcea, falling, inflammation or
ulce ration of the ute/us, ovarian troubles, that " bearing-down " feeling,
dizziness, faintness, indigestion, nervous prostration or the blues should
take immediate action -to ward off the serious consequences, and be
restored to perfect health and strength by taking Lydia E. Pinkliam's
Vegetable. Compound, and then i write to Mrs. Pinkham, Lynn/Mass.,
for further free advice. No living person has had such a vast and
successful experience in.treatinÂ£ female ills. She has guided thousands
to health. Every suffering woman should ask for and follow her advice.
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound has carried hundreds
of women through the periods of child bearing and change of life in
perfect comfort and safety.
A medicine that has restored so many women to health and can prodnce
proof of the fact must be regarded with respect. This is the record of Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, which cannot be equalled by any
other medicine the. world has ever produced.
It is well to remember these facts when some druggist tries to get you to
buy something which he says is "just as good." That is impossible, as no
other medicine has such a record of cures as Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound ; so do not experiment with untried medicines.

NEW TORK. Sept. 20.â The . principal Inci
dent in to-day's stock market was the recur
rence of the consideration of speculators to the
money mÂ«rket outlook. The unexpectedly
heavy movement of currency to the Interior for
the week by express, as reported by the banks,
was the immediate cause of this development.
The early advance in the stock market was
checked vrhen the published estimates made
their appearance and prfces sold off, practically
wiping out the earlier train?. The estimates
do not Include to-day's operations and as yes
terday was a holiday and practically no busi
ness is dor.e on Saturday, the showing is for
only four days. Vet the shipments of money .
to the interior by the banks were the heaviest
of any week in the season, reaching $5,380,256,
compared with $3.037.S16 last week. Allowing
for the receipts the net loss by the banks was
Tiearly S3.000.000. This is a considerable offset
to the gain on Eubtreasury operations, which
reached up to last night S11.M7.0C0. As th2 ex- '
traordir.ary measures of the Treasury for the â¢
relief of the market have about exhausted
their force the effect next week of the heavy
interior demand becomes somewhat disquiet'ng.
The loan item in to-morrow's bank statement
ie also to be reckonpdvwith In connection with
the fact of subscriptions by the banks to sev
eral large municipal bond Issues. The an
nouncement late In the day of an engagement
of ISOO.OCO in gold at Paris for import had enly
a slight effect on the market, as the exchange
rates are considered too hlRh to bring any
considerable amount of gold yet. The rate
to-day continued steady and was affected by
the larce selling of stocks for London account
un >r the disturbing influence of a considerable
military cucc^ss of the Boers/ .The violent and
erratic fluctuations in Amalgamated Copper
were also a disturbing influence In the mar
ket. This "Etock sold as low as 104 and then
rallied to 1C8H. fluctuating feverishly over a
lesser range between these figures. The "an
nouncement of the dividend action was with
held until after the clote of the market. Ap
parently there was a sharp demand at the last
from a short Interest. The omission of the
customary VS per cent extra dividend for the
quarter, Ifaving the regular rate 1% per cent,
came as a surprise in spite of the recent heavy
decline of the stock. During the early rise ln
lÂ»rices, the same Influences prevailed as for
pome time paet. especially the conviction that
a plan Is progressing for the merger of/ all
the VanderbtK roads by the formation of a
financial company to ; hold . the stocks of the
various railroad companies. â¢

Among the more favorable of the purely com
mercial and industrial features of. the week
have been the continuance of ' the good 'Â¦' de
mend of â¢ the jobbers, the -targe : shipments of
pods with which to fill these: demands, the
better call for goods at retail,*induced by the
arrival of cool fall-weather and' last, but' not
least, the settlement of the steel" strike, which
restores at least 50.C0O men to their work The
unfavorable features are. few, the most not
able being the advices of the arrival of heavy
frosts in -the corn belt, affecting, however, only
thejatest planted product. Cottons alone of
all* the leading Â¦ staples 'showed | irregularity '
The resumption of work in the hoop, sheet,
tinplate and tube mills has been a feature of
the week. Steel rails are being well taken
at the West and steel mills are. reported sold
ahead to next year. " Jobbers Â¦ in Iron and steel
are busy supplying small : lots to bridge over
consumers until the mills recently - on Â¦ strike
can come into the market. ' PIgiron Is in bet
ter inquiry and Bradstreefs, Birmingham cor
respondent reports an advance of 25c per ton.
Export business Is - very slow. Â¦ The ether
metals are without much' change.-. Tin Is ex
cited but copper is 1 steady, despite stock mar
ket rumors of heavy distributions of stock.
' NEW YORK, Sept. .20.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say. The sad events of the week
have : naturally been^ repressing J features, even
In. days -when, the sense, of- national bereave
ment did not seek expression in.' total or par
tial suspension of all but the absolutely, neces
sary activities. The reduced figures of sales of
products or securities dealt in speculatively
and the. lessened value of bank clearings were
among the most prompt measures of' the re
pression under which the business world has
labored, but the course of prices of nearly all
stocks and staples shows that repression and
not depression' is the J word to â¢ express the
steadiness and confidence -with which the com
mercial and financial - world waited and ' re
ceived the change ln executives. >>

DECIDUOUS FRUITS,
Yesterday was the first day -this ,year on
which, the fruit market could be. called glutted.
This was due to the fact that there were two
days' receipts to be worked off, as the I usual
quantities came : in Thursday when all the
commission houses were closed. It was reported
that there were .10,000 boxes of Peaches on
hand, most of which remained on the wharf.
A8 for Figs, they were scattered, about every
where. Melons were piled up in long Hues
along the sidewalks, and Cantaloupes were of
fered down to 25c per crate. Grapes held up
well, considering the large supplies and the
cool and cloudy weather.

To-morrow evening "Kol Nidre," or the
eve of "Yom Kipi>^," the Day of Atone
ment, will be celebrated. According to the
Jewish belief, man Is supposed to strive
and make his peace with heaven, first,
however, having made It with his fellow
man by acquitting himself of all his obli
gations to him by making full and just
reparation for any damage he may have
caused him during the year. The Day of
Atonement does not release a man from
any obligation, debt or responsibility' to
his fellow-man or to society; only such
matters as are, between a man and his
own conscience. A man can ask to be for
given for such vows and obligations that
may have been taken In a rash moment
thoughtlessly and Impulsively, and then
only when they have reference to himself
alone and reflect upon no other human
being.
Every Jew Is supposed to do noth
ing that will remove his thoughts from
the solemnity of tho Day of Atonement,
and to devote his time solely to religious
devotion. He therefore abstains from in
dulgence in luxuries, and even refrains
from partaking of food during the time
so that nothing may come between him
and the pious mentlments which hold him
during the entlro day. The blast from
the shofar or. cornet will signalize the end
of the day.
Services of the most solemn character
will be held in the synagogues of this city
to-morrow evening. At sundown the Day
of Atonement, the most sacred holiday
among the Hebrew people, begins and will
not end until sunset the following night..

VANCOUVER. B. C , Sept. 20.â The Do
minion Government is taking unusual pre
cautions to guard against any attempt
upon the lives of the Duke and Duche3Â»
ol! Cornwall and York, who will shortly
â¢cross 'the continent to the Pacific Coast.
Arrangements have been made with tho
Canadian Pacific Railway Company for
the transportation of the Imperial couplo
and their party. The safety of the royal
f>arty having thus been practically placed
n the hands of the railway company that
corporation Is- taking extraordinary meas
ures.
Two trains will convey the party across
the continent from Montreal, and each
will be preceded by two special pilot en
gines. Arrangements have been made for
the employment of about 10,000 guards,
who will patrol the 3000 miles that Inter
vene between the old Quebec city and
Vancouver. Each of these men will be in
eight of the patrols in front of and be
hind him. and several hundred superin
tendents wlU pee to It that none of tha
men forsake their posts. All railway
bridges will be especially guarded for sev
eral days before the royal trains pasa
over the road, and all switches will bo
railed down so as to reduce to a minimum
any possibility of danger to the heir ap
parent to Britain's throne. The oldest
and most trustworthy engineers, firemen
and conductors on the road have already
teen chosen to take the royal trains on

Culman admitted that he had said
something cf the kind, "but not in those

these experts as to Mr. Chanler's sanity."
Chanler, after graduating from Colum
bia University, was admitted to the bar
and became a successful lawyer. Amelie
Rives was then at the height of her popu

shoremen presented a series of resolu
tions condemning "the Board of Trade of
San Francisco" and the "so-called Mer
chants' Association" for asking Governor

stitute was carried by a vociferous. vote.

No time was wasted by the delegates to
the municipal convention of the Union
Labor party In getting down to business
last night at B'nal B'rith Hall.
Party Makes Several Nominations.
Municipal Convention of Union Labor
NAME PART OF TICKET.
Herrin is reported to be very bitter
against the Republican Primary League.
He goes so far as to declare that any
aspirant for office who was connected with
the league or who supported its candi
dates will be turned down. Herrin is not
a clever politician. He can do a neat turn
in manipulation for the fixing of water
rates or transportation charges, but he
has no aptitude for political management.
In the long Senatorial contest he blun
dered at every turn. He does not now
take Into consideration a fact obvious to
others that the nominees of the Repub
lican convention must be elected by the
people before they can hold office. He
does not consider that the Primary
League delegates secured eight thousand
votes at the primary election, or more
Republican votes than the delegates sup
ported by the allied bosses received. It
ought to be clear to Herrin's mind th:it
the league would now be in complete con
trol of the convention if Ralney, Greaney,
Maxwell and other Democratic bosses ban
not lined up Democrats to help Boss
Kelly. The Republicans who belong to
the Primary League are intelligent and
independent. If the good of the city
demands they will exercise the right of
voting for the best nominees, regardless
of party nomination. Herrin's threat to
exclude from consideration all Repub
licans who are connected with the Pri
mary League shows that ne does not un
derstand the first rudiments of party lead
ership. He cannot fulfill the compact
made with the Grand Hotel party to "do
up" the league.
It is not probable that nominations for
Mayor will be reached next Thursday
evening. The â¢ platform committee will
doubtless present an elaborate report.
Opportunity for discussion can hardly be
denied. Even if a sufficient number of
delegates to control the convention should
combine the leaders of the combination
would hardly insist on the extreme meas
ure of stifling debate on resolutions.
The list of candidates for Mayor is quite
formidable. Among those mentioned are
Asa R. Wells. Reginald Webster, Charles
R. Patton John C. Kirkpatrick. Thomas
V. Cator, "George Stone, Alfred Bouvier,
C. A. Murdock, Henry J. Crocker, Charles
S. Laumeister and ex-Superintendent of
Streets Kent. It is common talk that
Boss Kelly is trying to shape things so
that Laumeister may be put forward. In
the yellow building Kirkpatrick, Cator
and Stone are regarded favorably. Pat
ton has many friends in the convention.
It is said that school teachers would get
out and flght "Wells if he were nominated
for Mayor and It is also rumored that de
positors of the defunct Home Savings
Bank would organize to fight Colonel
Stone if he should get the nomination.
Gavin McNab, leader of the Democratic
forces, is out of town. He will be home
next Monday in season to definitely an
nounce the time and place for holding the
first session of the Democratic Municipal
Convention. It is understood that nomina
tions will be deferred until the evening
before the time for filing the ticket ex
pires.
The Republican local convention will
meet again next Thursday evening. Do
fore the convention organized many of
the aspirants accepted as facts the ru
mors that Herrin and his friends had
complete control of the works, but after
the programme was broken in the vote to
deprive the chairman of power to appoint
the committee on platform many candi
dates began to think that the delegates
were capable of Independent action. It is
said now that the bosses will not present
a slate until positive assurance is given
that the Thirty-third and Fortieth dis
trict delegations will not again balk at
the programme. Jesse Marks was counted
on to swing the Fortieth delegation, but
something happened to confuse the mean
ing of his orders. Owing to the sickness
of Colonel Burns affairs in this district
are still unadjusted.
At the close of the address of the Duke
In reply 3000 school children raised their
vclces In the strains of "God Save the
King." The party then left the stand, the
Duchess being shown to her carriage by
Premier Laurier and the Duke escorting
.Lady Laurier. The royal couple drove at
once to Rideau Hall, the official residence
of the Governor General, where they go
to live during the four days they remain
in Ottawa. As they rode through the
flag-hung streets the crowds surrounded
their carriages and offered new tributes
of cheers.
To-night at Rideau Hall there was a
state dinner, and all the notables gathered
hÂ«ire were bidden to attend. The-Parlia
ment buildings were outlined in light and
every large' structure In the city was
brightly illuminated. Thousands of lan
terns hung in the parks, gardens and
streets. The city was filled with visitors
from the surrounding cities and towns.
To-morrow the Duke will unveil the Vic
toria monument, present medals to the
Canadians who served In South Africa
and attend luncheon at the Rideau Club.
Later in the afternoon there will be a
garden party at Rideau Hall.

tlc ns. ' The Duke was attended by Lord
Burton and Lord Wenlock and his mili
tary and naval aids in brilliant uniforms.
The several addresses were presented at
once and the Duke made an extended re
ply, expressing his appreciation of the
honor shown. Among the addresses pre
sented was ona by Dr. Robert Upham,
president of the Canadian Club of Boston.
â¢ OTTAWA, Ont, Sept. 2O.-The Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall and York reached
tho Canadian capital to-day, and there.
was another great outpouring of enthu
siatim to give them a greeting of loyalty
and warmth. They left Montreal In their
special train at Â£> o'clock In the morning,
and their departure was marked by an
other demonstration of popular regard.
They departed from the Windsor-street
station, and a half-hour before they ar
rived at the station the lines of troopa and
police with difficulty kept the streets In
that section open to traffic. A troop of
Hussars surrounded their carriage and
their appearance was greeted by a cheer
that was heard many. blocks away.
The railroad track was lined with peo
ple far beyond the suburbs of Montreal,
anil down through the province of Quebec
and into the province of Ontario the peo
ple gathered at the way stations and
crcs3ings to catch a glimpse of the royal
couple. The train pulled up at the town,
of Alexandria lonr enough for the of
ficials to express a few words of welcome.
The Duko and Duchess appeared on the
platform for n moment and returned
thanks for the kindly expressions.
The royal special reached Ottawa at
11::15. and the Duke, attired in his favorite
uniform of admiral of the British navy,
alighted at once, accompanied by the
Duchess and the members of his staff.
They were formally received by Lord
Mlnto. Governor General, and escorted to
a state barouche.
A fcuard of honor from the Forty-third
Regiment was drawn up across the ap
proach to the station, and an escort from
tho Royal Canadian Dragoons was la
waiting. The dragoons reined their
horses alongside the barouche and the
Duke and Duchess were driven to Parlia
ment Hall. The streets through which
th*y moved were splendidly decorated and
thousands of people were banked behind
thÂ« police and sentry lines.
It was in Parliament Hall, surrounded by
tho handsome group of Government build-
Ing's, that the formal ceremony of greet
ing; the heir apparent took place, and here
was gathered- the largest crowd of all.
The* royal pair were cheered heartily aa
they entered the square and were shown,
to a flag-covered stand.
It was announced by those close to Pat
tison that a ' new organization would at
once be created with a full city commit
tee. Negotiations will, in all likelihood be
opened with the Union party, looking to
ward fusion with . that organization
through the regular Republican and Dem
ocratic organizations.
â¢ Believing, as I do, . that the overwhelming'
sentiment of the Democrats of Philadelphia is
that this Is an occasion when we should unite
with the Independent Republicans for the over
throw of the corrupt ring which is disgracing
the. administration of public affairs in our city,
I am prepared to give my time and service
toward any movement which will bring about
such a condition of affairs as will secure com
plete fusion and will accomplish this result
After the convention had adjourned Pat-'
tlspn announced his- resignation as chair
man of the' committee, to take effect at
once. Pattison, in the course of his letter
of resignation, says:. .-
â¢PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 20.-A sensation
was sprung In local political circles to
day when ex-Governor Robert IS. Pattison
announced his resignation from the Demo
cratic City Committee as .a. result of, the
action of the county convention In nomin
ating a Hinilyht-o'ut Democratic ticket.
Coupled with this statement was a sug-.
gestlon from Pattison that a new Demo
cratic, organization be formed in the city,
which brought out a statement from Na
tional Commltteeman James A. Duffy,
heartily endorsing the suggestion.
The party organization in this city is
controlled by ex-City Chairman J. P. Don
nelly and City Commissioner Thomas J.
Ryan and there has of lato been much op
position to their leadership. Efforts, have
been made by Pattison and his supporters
to have tho organization fuse with the
Union party in this city, which has nom
inated P. F. Rothermel (the Incumbent)
for District Attorney against the Repub
lican nominee, John "Weaver. These ef
forts failed, and to-night* the Democratic
convention placed the. following straight
out ticket in the field: For District Attor
ney, Ex-Postmaster jW. Wilkins Carr;
Controller, James Â¦ G. -Magee; Recorder of
Deeds, .Henry Fernberger; Clerk of Court
of Quarter Session, Herman V. Helzell;
member of the Board of Revision of Tax

The Czar and Czarina took their leave
of President and Mme. Loubet and retired
to their apartments after the perform-'
once, as all must rise early to-morrow. in
order to leave by the -8. o'clock train for
the review at Bethany. The review will
be followed by a luncheon at which the
political toasts for which all France Is
eagerly waiting will be pronounced. Too
Russian sovereigns will then leave. France
for their return to Russia. . .
The chateau constituted a striking com
ment upon the extraordinary precautions
surrounding every step the Czar has
taken since he set foot on French soil. M.
Loubet gave no inkling of his intention.
The first thing known not merely to the
general public but to the police was when
the President, accompanied by M. Wal
deck-Rousseau.and General Dubols. chief
of the military household, emerged from
the gates of the chateau on foot.- The
road to the town hall was cleared as well
as possible.
The Mayor, who was at the town hall
with a view to the possibility of such a
visit, even had to send out and gather in
the members of the Town Council, who
were quietly, sleeping after lunch In the
neighboring cafes. The visit was con
ducted in a charming manner, such as en
dears M. Loubet to the French people.
All ceremony was absolutely excluded
and the whole proceedings were carried
out In the most informal fashion. M.
Loubet chatted cordially with the Mayor
and Councilors, making joking remarks
and asking questions regarding the an
tiquities and paintings In. the .municipal
museum. He had a kind word for the
daughter of the- Janitor as he left the
building.
The baptism of the son of the Count of
Montebello took place in the apartments
of the Czar after his, return from the
drive. His Majesty had promised to act
as godfather. It was originally Intended
that the ceremony should occur at the
chateau of the Count, and Prince Ourous
soff, Russian Embassador to France, had
been designated to represent the Emperor.
Last night, however,, the Czar expressed
an intention to act personally, and the
rite of baptism was to be performed at 6
o'clock. Only the Czar and Czarina and
members of the family of the Count were
present. The child was christened Nich
olas, after the Czar, who said the credo
in Russian.
The crowning feature of the day's
events .was the performance in the cha
teau theater, which followed a grand ban
quet ln^the famous hall of columns, the
members of the French Cabinet, the offi
cers of the Senate and Chamber of Depu
ties and leading members of the suite of
the Czar and M. Loubet being present.
The upper gallery of the theater was oc
cupied â¢ solely v by secret police, who were
masked behind a rampart of palms and
flowers. ' .
' The streets of Complegne presented a
most animated aspect all day long. In
the afternoon an immense concourse gath
ered in the hope of witnessing the Czar
and Czarina drive through a part of the
town or the outer park, but the only sen
sation enjoyed was a pleasant visit to the
town hall from M. Loubet.
Disappointment for Crowds.
In order to test the measures taken to
safeguard his Majesty's person during the
drive five detectives were instructed to
attempt to enter the park last evening
under cover of darkness. In every case
they were captured before getting Inside
the chateau gardens.'
The Emperor wore the undress uniform
of the Prevbrajenski Regiment. He
changed his route quite unexpectedly; and
instead of proceeding to Pierrefonds took,
a short drive to the village of Beaumonts,
returning to the Chauteau Complegne ai
5 o'clock. In the. meantime crowds a^
sembled in. the streets of Pierrefonds,
awaiting his expected arrival. The streets
were gayly decorated by the local authori
ties. Expectation, however, was destined
to be disapDOinted. The route was kept
free of traffic by gendarmes, but' all to
no purpose. .
After giving it to be understod that he
would arrive at Pierrefonds the Czar left
the chateau with the Czarina- in' a-vic
toria at 3 o'clock, escorted by a few de
tectives on bicycles. Measures were taken,
within the park, however, that absolutely
precluded the attempts of any stragglers
to approach, while every few yards the
palisade . inciosure was guarded, by foot
soldiers.
After going to the chateau the Emperor
had a long interview with M. Waldeck-,
Rousseau, the French Premier. It lasted at ;
least two hours. Count J-iamsdorff, the
Russian Foreign Minister, also conferred
with M. Delcasse, the French Minister or
Foreign Affairs. Naturally what took
place has not been divulged, but it . is
whispered that the principal subject of
the interview was the commercial rela
tions between France and Russia. 'Â¦
Interviews the Premier.
His Majesty remained in his apartments
after breakfast quietly until 10 o'clock,
when he took a short promenade in the
gardens, attired In a dark lounge suit and
top boots, with the Czarina, ciad in her
invariable half-mourning and followed by:
a hound. The Empress carried her cam
era, with which she took a number of
views. Their Majesties passed a squad
of Infantry stationed on guard. There
upon the Czarina photographed the group,
subsequently conversing with the officers
and promising that they should â¢ have a
photograph.- â¢ . ' â¢
COMPIEONE, Sept. 20.-Emperor Nich
olas exercised the prerogative of an auto
crat to-day and kept President Loubet
and all the French occupants of the
Chauteau Complegno marking time the
wholo morning until he had signified his
desires. It was fully expected that I he
would drive to Plerrefond* and visit the
castle, and that afterward he would go
shooting In the great park attached to the
chateau. All the arrangements had been
made and 600 pheasants were brought
specially last evening and let loose In the
covers. But he did nothing of the kind.

have no more coffee In the house. Now
I don't know what it is to have dyspepsia
and I can eat anything. I also give
Postum to my two children and they are
the healthiest children you could find any-
where. The youngest is a boy 13 months
old and we have been giving him Postum
for seven months, three times a day. He
wcip^g 30 pounds, and I know that Postum
is viiat keeps both of them so healthy.

ret it from coffee drinking.

Resoled, That this nation should take at
once such steps as will rid it for all time and
effectually of every trace of anarchism, social
ism, yellow journalism and all other breeders
of assassins wherever their spawn has blis
tered and blighted "the face of our beloved
country.- - ' . ,.
War Veterans Take Action.
Resolved, That, while bowing down in sub
mission to the will of Almighty God and pay
ing out of full hearts our. homage of love and
reverence to the great and good President
whose death has smitftn the nation" with bitter
grief, we humbly ask that he will also so in
culcate his children with the. spirit of love and
peace that the human breast may be no longer
stimulated with, those dread passions of hatred
that dominated the malignant heart of the
assassin and prompted his awful crime.
Whereas.' . It has pleased Almighty God, in
his infinite wisdom, to call from a loving wife
a>tender husband and from a now stricken
nation Its beloved President; . and whereas,
every act of his public and his private life gave
testimouy of his nobility of character and his
Christian manhood. Now, therefore be it
Resolved, by the Yowng People's Societies of
the churches of this city in this memorial ser
vice assembled. That we hereby express in this
public manner our sympathy, our sorrow and
our regret. Our sympathy for the grief
stricken wife; our sorrow commingled with our
natlen's sorrow; our regret that so noble a
life, so true a Christian, so God-fearing and
so God-loving a man must needs be sacrificed
that we be awakened as a nation to our civic
and our moral duties. â¢ And be It further

"Sir" Harry's Trial
Flowers and Etiquette j
Before Court.
"Dress" Rings, Appropriate
"Sir" Harry Westwood Cooper's second
trial is becoming interesting. It is par
ticularly Interesting to the feminine mind
and probably only a jury of women,
versed in the difference between a
"dress" ring and an engagement ring, the
propriety of carrying lilies of the valley
or roses at a wedding ceremony, and
whether "a lady should accept about $900
worth of dress goods in one full sweep
from a suitor to whom she had on thir
teen different occasions refused her hand,
could decide with* dispatch.
Ethel Toung. the Brisbane wife of
Cooper, or Chadwick, as he Is also known,
was on hand with her mother in Judge
Lawlor's court yesterday. The prose
cution made an attempt to prove by
the mother that Cooper was a bigamist,
but Attorney Murphy was on his feet in
a moment, proclaiming his many objec
tions. He had the court order the patri
archal looking jury led from the scene of
action to some obscure Â¦ room where the
poison of prejudice could not beset thejr
gray* matter. They were soon led bacK,
tor Judge Lawlor. ruled against the Dis
trict Attorney. The Brisbane mother-in
law retreatea to the District -Attorney's
office.
Mrs. Marie Schneider and Attorney C.
F. Humphreys made the jury's mind clear
about the mythical Chadwick estate and
castles, which they had incorporated with
a capitalization of $75,000. T.hey became
directors and Cooper willingly had them
bestow 20,000 shares of the par value of $1
upon Norine. - â¢ -
That was the morning story of the in
trigues of "Sir" Harry. â¢
The prosecution wanted to elucidate a
few more things with Norine Schneider's
resistance in the afternoon, so she tripped
daintily to the stand, her great Gains
borough casting a shadow on "Sir" Harry
as she passed him.
The prosecution having concluded its
questions. Attorney Murphy asked a few
that made the phetty Norine rather ner
vous. His questions to the young lady
indica-ted his surprise that she should
go with her mother and "Sir" Harry to
the White House to have him order 5900
worth of dresses for her. She declared
she was not engaged, the clothes being
merely a gift. It also developed that
"Sir" Harry paid $20 down and the
mother $15 to bind the bargain. Norine
never received the raiment. The "dress"
ring, the term for which, according to the
Schneiders, was "Sir" Harry's invention,
was worn by her to the White House on
this occasion.
When the prosecution rested Horace
B. Gardiner, the youthful Postmas
ter of Crockett, was "Sir" Harry's
first witness, and the defense is trying
to convince the jury that there was an
engagement and that the telegram was
an entirely innocent affair. Gardiper had
talked with Mrs. Schneider and she had
volunteered the statement that Norine
was engaged to "Sir" Harry, then known
as Dr. Chadwick, and she also told him
of his estates and wealth.
Rudolph Saake, a florist, told of a visit
of ICorine, her mother and "Sir" Harry
to his store. They ordered flowers for
the wedding and he discussed with Norine
the matter of carrying lilies of the valley
or roses at ths wedding. His books will
have to prove what selection was made,
so -the case was continued until Tuesday
morning at- 10 o'clock.
WITTMAN LOSES SUIT.
When the case of Captain Wittman was
called in Judge Cabaniss" court yesterday
the Judge was served with the writ of
ccrtibrari. It was evidently a surprise to
the prosecution. After argument of coun
sel as to a continuance the Judge fixed
the date as September 27. at 2 p. m., and
the jurors and witnesses were requested
to return at that tine. â¢ '- . - Â¦ 'â¢
Th* plea of Captain Wittman for a writ
of prohibition preventing Judge Cabaniss
from proceeding with the trial of Witt
man on a charge of battery before a jury
summoned by the Sheriff was refused by
Judge Sea well yesterday. The writ was
sought for on the ground that Judge Ca
baniss had exceeded his jurisdiction in
ordering the Sheriff to summon a venire
for jury duty.
Judge Seawell contended that prohibi
tion was not the remedy. Wittman's at
torneys went to Judge Dunne immediate
ly after the decision was given and se
cured from him a writ of certiorari, which
â¢will stay all proceedings until the legality
of. the Police Judge's action is definitely
settled. ' .
The case v.ill be reviewed by Judge Sea
weil Monday. . â¢ . â¢

Mrs. Hannah Roberts, a well-known
Californian. and 'Edward E. .Thomas, a
wealthy mining man of Scranton,- Pa.,
procured a marriage license yesterday and
a few. hours later were united in mar
riage. The ages of the couple were re
spectively â¬3 and â¬9 years.
An Aged Couple ITaited.
The tanbark will bo consigned to Red
wood City, and will have to be transhipped
from the schooner to a barge and sent on
to Its destination.
- Charles Rule, the millionaire lumberman
and. dairyman of Duncans Mills, is In San
Francisco to learn from Chief of 'Police
Sullivan whether protection will be fur
nished to a crew and longshoremen whom
he proposes to put at work discharging
the cargo of a steam schooner. If he is
rot given the desired assurance he intends
to come down himself with - an- armed
guard capable of coping with any. body of
strikers that may interfere.
Mr. Rule recently sought to engage the
steam schooner Navarro to carry a cargo
of -oak wood and tanbark. The agents,
A; \V. Beadle & Co.. ; were not/willing to
take the cargo unless Rule would agree
to send a half-dozen armed men down to
protect the' non-union crew and long
shoremen during the discharging; of : the
cargo. Rule decided to make xlÂ» appeal
first to the Chief of Police, but whatever
ihe.reEult of his interview there he is de
.termined that his contracts shall be" car
ried out. peaceably or otherwise, as the
strikers may make necessary.

WO men haj 7 e died within twenty-
I ' four hours on the Oakland side of
I the bay from the effects of beat
il ' ings administered by strikers in
San Francisco. One is Frank
McGuire, a sailor, who lived in Temescal,
and the other Renas Mathesen, 'whose
home was in Alameda.
Each of -the men was beaten on the
San Francisco water front and then went
home to die. The circumstances tha^ ,
surrounded ,the cases are almost iden
tical, and the matter is. now. in the
hands of Coroner Mehrmann of Alameda
County to see whether he can trace the
crime and fix the responsibility for the
death of the two men. Â¦
Autopsies were held yesterday, and the I
physicians have reported to Coroner [
Mehrmann that the deaths resulted from
beatings. From what ! the - unfortunate
men were able to tell before death came,
those who lnnifcted the injuries -were" San
Francisco 'strikers; and Coroner Mehr
mann was in communication with the San
Francisco Police Department yesterday to
see if It had any information that would
help him in his investigation of these
cas&s.
The inquest upon the body of McGuire
will be held to-night, while the date or
the Mathesen inquest has yet to be set.
Drs. H. W. Rowell of Berkeley and
Charles A. "Dukes of Oakland performed
the autopsy upon the body of McGuire.
'.They have reported to .the Coroner that
death resulted from meningitis caused by
the blow upon the head.
McGuire arrived in San Francisco about
ten days ago on the steamer Fresno from
Alaska. After he landed he walked into
a saloon to get a drink. He was taken
for a non-union sailor and was set upon
by a band of union men and beaten into
Insensibility. He was- found -by the -police
and taken to the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital, where he was treated, and then re
moved to the home of his sister, Mrs.
James ; Cummings, at 434 Forty-fifth
street, Oakland. He never thoroughly re
covered consciousness. ; ; - . .
Renas Mathesen was a coachman, who
lived in Alameda. ' He was unmarried and
was the only support of his aged mother,
who is utterly helpless -without him. At
tracted by the high wages being paid ,f or
help on the water front, Mathesen en
tered the employ of the Overland Freight
Transfer Company. On Saturday he was
injured by having a box fall upon his leg.
He did not go to work on Monday, but
went to the office of the company to col
lect his pay. On his return to the water
front he stepped Into a saloon to get a
drink and was there recognized as a. non
union man and was set upon j and beaten
into insensibility. ;
When he partially regained conscious
ness Mathesen made his way to his home
In Alameda, where Dr. H. M. Pond at
tended him. Like McGuire, he never thor
oughly regained consciousness. His mind
was alwaj r s clouded- from the blows that
he received upon the head, and Thursday
night he died. Dr. Pond says that death
resulted from meningitis that came from
blows on the head. .
. Coroner Mehrmann has not yet set the
date of this inquest;, but it will probably
be on Monday evening next.
