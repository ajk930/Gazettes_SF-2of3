'Â¦ * lombia, Nov. 27.â The Colombian
insurgents have recaptured the Bar
bacoas bridgre; have driven the Gov
ernment forces from Bahia Soldado and
Buena Vista, and a few minutes ago. Gen
eral Barrera, arriving here on horseback,
announced that General Alban's force had
been routed and had returned to its posi
tion near San Pablo.
Fighting took place along the Panama
Railroad all day and was at times furious.
â¢While The Call correspondent was taking
notes less than an hour ago near Buena
Vista spent bullets dropped near his posi
tion.
At that time two wounded Liberals, who
were on their way to Bahia Boldado, re
ported that they, had seen only a few
wounded insurgents at Buena Vista, but
that the Government loss was heavy.
They said that the railroad bed was cov
ered at one spot with the dead and
wounded of the Government troops and
that the latter were shooting some of
their wounded.
A train was forced to stop because of
bodies on the track. The bodies were re
moved quickly and the train proceeded.
Many bodies are floating down the
Chagres River. The excitement along thâ¬
river is intense.
Government Forces Mowed Down.
The correspondent has just learned from
General Barrera, who has been the prin
cipal leader of the insurgent forces dur
ing the day's fighting, the details of the
rout of General Alban to San Pablo,
which is near the middle of the isthmus.
General Barrera says that his soldiers
captured a Galling gun in the middle of
the railroad track near Buena Vista*
The San Francisco Call.
There was a lull in the fighting just be
fore the capture of the gun. The insur
gents had ceased firing in order to deceive
the enemy. The ruse worked very well,
for in a few minutes the Government
troops rushed forward. They thought
that the revolutionists were out of ammu
nition and were preparing to retreat. In
their indiscretion they exposed themselves
and the rebels poured into them a galling
fire. The Government force was mowed
down mercilessly. Then fallowed a rout
and Alban's soldiers sought protection in
their position in the vicinity of San Pablo.
The Liberals are enthusiastic. They are
shouting this evening, "Vivan los Lib
erales: 1 They are expecting reinforce
ments from Gatun in about an hour.
Alban's Soldiers Surprised.
This day of revolutionary success, which
undid all that the Government troops ac
complished yesterday, began at 4 o'clock
this morning. General Barrera decided to
surprise Alban's victorious soldiers, who
were encamped around the liarbacoas
bridge, which is a strategic point and
which the insurgents were determined to
recapture. The bridge is an iron structure
and crosses the Chagres River. General
Barrera's activity brought him complete
triumph. The Government force was com
pletely surprised. There was stubborn re
sistance at the bridge for a few minutes,
but the revolutionists occupied such a
good position that Alban's soldiers could
not withstand the attack.
The insurgents, cheering, crossed the
bridge and took a position on the other
side and kept driving the Conservatives
before them. *
General Alban> with 600 men, left San
Pablo at 10 o'clock in the morning, but
could not stem the tide against him. He
proceeded to Buena Vista, where there

From Bahia So'dado and Buena Vista With Heavy Loss
was fierce fighting. The revolutionists
kept well under cover and advanced stead
ily. They were well supplied with am
munition. Only for brief intervals were
there lulls In the hostilities.
The Fighting Has Ceased.
After the Government forces had been
driven from Buena Vista the correspond
ent returned to this place. The latest in
telligence from the front is that the fight
ing has ceased. The victorious insurgents
are weary from their long day's battle and
it Is not likely that they will attack the
Government troops near San Pablo to
night.
News comes that two vessels have land
ed Liberal reinforcements and a large sup
ply of ammunition at Chorrera. The
troops with ammunition are on their way
here.
There is a flotilla of insurgent craft at
Point Chame, on the Pacific coast, about
fifteen miles from Chorrera. Among the
vessels are the rebel gunboats Monotombo
and Darlen. This flotilla has brought a
large supply of ammunition and many
men from the Ecuadorian coast.
Couriers report that residents in and
near San Pablo are seeking refuge in the
mountains. They anticipate that a battle
will be fought around San Pablo to-mor
row.
It is said that Government troops have
looted the houses of San Pablo residents.
According to the statement of insur
gents the Government loss during yes
terday's fighting was heavier than has
been reported. The revolutionists say that
of 300 Federal soldiers engaged sit and
around Barbacoas bridge all except about
fifty were killed or wounded. The insur
gents lost eleven men in killed and
wounded.
MANY DROWNED IN CHAGRES.
Government Losses Very Heavy in
Barbacoa Battle.
COLON, Colombia, Nov. 27, 2 p. m.â The
following dispatch has been received from
Panama:
The Colombian gunboat Boyaca was dis
patched Tuesday, having on board about
fifty soldiers, for Chamo or its vicinity,
where it was said a party of Liberals,,
under General Torres, has received quite
recently a fresh supply of arms and am
munition.
San Paolo and Barbacoa are known here
to be Liberal strongholds and places very
easy to defend, while to cross the bridge
spanning the Chagres River, now swollen,
was next to impossible for an attacking
force. The feat was accomplished, how
ever, but the reason the Liberals aban
doned Barbacoa Is not made clear. The
death rate on the Government side was
very great, many bodies falling into Jihe
river. An attempt was also made to make
a detour on the river en boats, but the
Chagres being swollen the boats capsized
and many were" drowned.
General Castro commands the Govern
ment force at Barbacoa. General Alban
tried to get a train yesterday morning to
convey 200 men to the scene of the en
gagement at Barbacoa, but Captain Perry
of the lowa said that not a single armed
man would be allowed to entrain.
The feeling here against foreigners, par
ticularly Americans, r#ins high.
A special train at Panama to convey
General Alban, alone and unarmed, await
ed the arrival for hours of the morning
train from Colon, but on the arrival of
the latter here at 6 o'clock In the evening.

Head-On Collision Between Two
Passenger Trains Running
at High Speed*
Unfortunates Not Killed Instantly
Are Roasted to Death by
the Flames*
One of the most appalling railroad disasters in the last ten
years occurred last night on the Wabash Railroad. Seneca,
Mich., was the scene of a head-on collision between passenger
trains 13 and 4, two of the fastest trains on the division. Train
/j was crowded zvith immigrants, who were caught like rats in
a trap and crushed. Fire broke out in the tvrecked cars and
many who were not instantly killed were slowly roasted to death.
From 100 to 150 persons were killed or injured in the wreck
and holocaust. The old, old story is repeated â a misunderstand
ing of orders or a mistake in giving them to the approaching
trains caused the catastrophe.
DETROIT, Nov. 27. â From 100 to 150 persons were
killed or injured to-night in a wreck on the Wabash
Railroad. Two heavily loaded passenger trains collided
head on at full speed one mile east of Seneca, the second
station west of Adrian. The westbound train, composed of two
cars loaded with immigrants and five other coaches, was
smashed and burned, with awful loss of life and fearful injuries to
a majority of its passengers. The eastbound passenger train, the
Continental Limited, suffered in scarcely iess degree.
The track in the vicinity of the wreck is strewn with dead
and dying. Many physicians from Detroit have gone to the
scene.
DISOBEDIENCE OF ORDERS THE CAUSE OF DISASTER.
The Continental Limited, the eastbound train, was driven
by Engineer Strong and was in charge of Conductor J. Martin.
The westbound immigrant train was a double-header and was
driven by Engineer Work and Engineer Parks, the conductor
being Charles Troll. The eastbound train, it is believed, dis
obeyed orders in not waiting at Seneca for the westbound train,
'thereby causing the wreck. The track at the point where the
collision occurred was straight, and at first the officials could
not understand how the accident could have happened. The
westbound train, which ordinarily is due to leave Detroit at 2:30
o'clock, was two hours late, leaving at 4:20 p. m. The two trains
are scheduled to meet at Montpelier, Ohio but, as stated, had
been ordered to meet at Seneca. The blame is therefore placed
on the conductor or engineer of the eastttound train, as the acci
dent could not have occurred had this train been held at Seneca.
Apparently orders to wait were disobeyed, and the probabilities
are that the true story of why will never be told, as the train
crews undoubtedly met instant death.
BODIES ARE BTJRZfED BEYOND RECOGNITION.
Advices from the wreck at midnight state that the country
for miles around is lighted up by the burning cars and that the
flames could not be quenched because of lack of proper appara
tus. Mangled bodies were picked up along the track by the
farmers before the special train sent from Adrian arrived on the
scene. In some instances the bodies were mangled beyond all
recognition. The bodies which the rescuers managed to pull
from the burning ruins of the immigrant cars were so badly
burned that their identity will probably never be ascertained.
The westbound train was a regular train composed of seven
coaches. Reports differ as to the number of coaches carrying
immigrants. One says there were but two, and another says
there were five or six coaches carrying this class of tourists.
WHEN THE TRAINS CRASHED TOGETHER.
It is not thought any Detroit people were injured, as train
No. 3, immediately behind the immigrant train, carried the De
troit passengers for Chicago.
The eastbound train was made up of an engine, baggage
car, combination coach and sleeper.
The trains came together one mile east of Seneca, under a
full hesfo of steam. All but the two rear coaches of the west
bound train were demolished and the coach on the eastbound
train was telescoped. Five of the cars of the immigrant train
caught fire and are still burning. The loss of life is estimated at
100 on this train. The loss of life on the eastbound train is said
to be twenty-five. One of the engines of the immigrant train ex
ploded and the eastbound engine turned over into a ditch. Two
firemen and one engineer of the westbound train were killed, but
the fireman and engineer of the other train jumped and escaped.
RELIEF TRAINS, ARE SENT.
As soon as, the news of the disaster reached Division Super
intendent Burns at Detroit special trains were dispatched to the
scene of the wreck from Adrian, Detroit, Peru and Montpelier.
A special train from Detroit, carrying thirty-two physicians and
surgeons, started for Seneca and was given the right of way.
When it reached the scene of the wreck the work of suc
coring tbA wounded was well under way, the train having been
preceded by a special from Adrian bearing all the surgeons in

en early controversy between the Presi

Governor General Wood is on his way

cf this country are very much in earnest
in their opposition to any reduction of
the tariff on raw sugar coming from any
quarter and furthermore are well organ

"The Cubans are , increasing their de

would be satisfied with a 10 per cent re

again and lay before the President a re

PARIS, Nov. 27.â publication in the
Matin and other morning papers on No
vember 26 of alleged extracts from the
confidential report of General * Voyron,
former commander of the French troops
in China, T which the Government refused
to communicate to the Chamber of Depu- I
ties, last week during the discussion of the !
bilKtv-'-ttntisnize a loan to reimburse â¢ the j
treasury for the outlay in connection i
Â¦with the Chinese expedition, has- revived
interest in the matter of the alleged loot- Â¦
ing of Peking.
In a published interview, M. Pichon
(who was the French Minister to China
at the time of the Boxer outbreak) de- I
nles that any ladies connected with the
legation engaged in the looting, though
he says it was true that two ladies, who
were not connected with the legations,
did engage in the pillage. After Peking
had been relieved he himself ordered that
all baggage of French people leaving Pe
king: be searched in order to discover
whether it contained gold or silver bars
looted during the first impulse resulting
from the effervescence - and excitement
which followed the end of the sufferings
caused by the siege. France was the only
power which took this measure.
As to the auctions in the legations,
they occurred in only one legation, the
English or the American. M. Plehon does
not say which, and the sales therein lasted
daily for three months from 3:30 o'clock in
the afternoon until sunset under the di
rection of army officers of the same coun
try and with the co-operation.of a legation
official. â¢

Party Platform Contains a Sugges

LONDON, Nov. Zi.â At to-day's session
of the annual conference of the National
Union of Conservative Associations at
Wolverhampton, the party platform was
enlarged by calling on the Government
to adopt drastic measures to suppress the
"organized obstruction of Nationalist
members of Parliament, which threatens
a recurrence of the agitation which
caused such misery twenty years ago,"
and to arrest Colonel Arthur Lynch, re
cently elected a member of Parliament
for Galway and who served in the Boer
army, immediately on his landing in Eng
land.
A delegate wanted the meeting to adopt
a resolution calling on the Government
to impose a protective duty on corn, but
this was scaled down to-day, in effect,
that for the better security of the nation
Parliament should devise measures for
the preservation and continuance of the
food supply in tine of war.
Changes in Rural Delivery.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.â The Presi
dent to-day signed an order bringing the
rural free delivery service into the classi

fective Immediately, so far as the 250
clerks, special agents and route inspect
ors of that service are concerned, but
provides that until regulations are formu
lated for the appointment of rural car
riers such employes shall not be treated
a* within the classified service. The car
riers- number 6000 and are steadily in
creasing. Vacancies other than those of
carriers will be filled by appointments
from eligible registers of the commis
sion.

The flames, however, had retarded the
work of rescue. The wounded had been
placed on stretchers m the coaches sent
from Adrian.
At 10:45 o'clock the first train loaded
with wounded from the scene of the wreck
arrived in Adrian. The dead were left be

Little Aid Is Rendered.
The wrecking train ordereiS from Mont

after 9 o'clock, but the heavy vestibuled
cars of the east-bound train lay between
it and the burning Immigrant cars, so that
little aid could be rendered to the res
cuers.
When the special train reached Adrian
the wounded were carried In ambulances,

Story of the Engineer.
Engineer Strong makes the following

"I was running sixty-five miles an hour,

the meeting to order:
The Lincoln Monument League has been in
existence for some years and has succeeded
in erousingr a strong patriotic feeling in be
half of its object. But experience has taught
its officers that the work of raising money
cannot be accomplished by means of 10-cent
subscriptions by Â«chool children, members of
the Grand Army and men who have happened
to become interested. If it could be generally
known how much effort has been put forth by
Buch men as my friend W. W. Stone, such
respect for the movement â¢ would be created
that the desired result would speedily be ac
comDlished.
To me it seems a positive disgrace that thir
ty-six years after the martyrdom of Lincoln
there should be even a question or discussion
of the production of a fund for a monument
to the memory of one of the greatest men the
Union has produced. .
The point now is to come to some conclusion
that will result in placing the Lincoln Monu
ment League on a satisfactory and durable
basis. When newspapers, bankers, manufac
turers and business men are Invited and under
take an enterprise, throwing into it not only
intelligence, but heart and ardor, the result
is as good as accomplished. Now, Is there
any object that can propose itself to the Ameri

ument to the great captain of the civil war?
Then let press and people unite In this move
ment.
Chief Justice Beatty, General Shafter,
W. W. Stone, Colonel George Stone, Su
perintendent of Schools Crawford of Ala
meda County, ex-Judge Dibble, Charles
Edelman and others took part in the dis
cussion that followed, the deliberations
ending in the decision to leave the ques
tion of methods to a committee to be ap
pointed by the chairman.
Judge Dibble made two suggestions that
apparently recommended themselves to
the favor of those present. He urged
that the hundredth anniversary of
the birth of Lincoln be set as
the date of the dedication of the monu
ment, and that all effort be bent toward
the completion of the monument by that
date. His other suggestion was that
Twin Peaks be made a Lincoln Park and
that on the summit, in full view for the
whole length of Market street, there be
erected a great shaft of structural steel
and California marble towering 600 to 1000
feet in the air.
The second collapsed and not a soul es
caped."
Willard Steams, editor of the Adrian
Press, who had just returned from the
wreck at 2:30 a. m., telephoned particu
lars to the Associated Press. 'Mr. Steams
said the cause of the disaster was tha
misreading of his order by Engineer
Strong of the Continental Limited. The
order read, "Pass at Seneca," but Strong
understood It to read Sand Creek. The
conductor of the train read the order
rightly. He did not know that the engi
neer had misunderstood it and supposed
his train was going on a siding. Finding
that the train was running rapidly, the
conductor put on the air brakes himself,
but he was too late, and just then the
engineer set the brakes to try to avert
the force of the collision.
The engineer's leg was broken and he
was otherwise injured. Seven dead were
taken out of one car of the Continental
Limited.
Weather Is Very Cold.
All those on that train who were killed
were on that car which was between the
smoker and dining cars. The bulk of the
injured persons were taken to Peru, Ind.,
and Montpeller, Ohio, the tracks of the
Detroit and Lima Northern and Cincin
nati Northern being utilized In getting
around the wreck.
Steams said that the scene of the
wreck was beyond description. The night
is bitterly cold and as there Is but one
farmhouse adjacent to the scene there
was but little shelter for the sufferer*.
Matters are In a chaotic condition and
there are scarcely any facilities for iden
tifying the dead. The railroad will not
permit the use of Its wires, the only ones
available for carrying the news.

Prefers to Be on the Safe
Side.

When the court convened In the afternoon
the defense asked permission to withdraw
the affidavits and waived the examining
trial. The prisoners were then held to the

SAN FRANCISCO
GETS THE CABLE
Mackay Says No Other
Terminus Is Under
Consideration.
Expects to Handle Messages
From Mainland to Hawaii
Next Autumn.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 27.â John W.
Mackay, president of the Postal Tele
graph and Cable Company, is here for a
week's rest and recreation. In Mr. Mac
kay's party are his private secretary, R.
V. Dey, and his attorney, W. S. Wood, of
San Francisco. Coast Manager L. W.
Storrer of the Postal met the party on
the arrival of the Owl from San Fran
cisco.
"I am not here for the purpose of seek
ing a terminus for the proposed cable,"
said Mr. Mackay. "We have already
chosen San Francisco for the terminal.
No other place has been seriously consid
ered. We expect to get the bulk of our
business from the northern city and the
saving in distance in locating the termi
nus in Southern California would be more
than counterbalanced by the overland
tolls to San Francisco.
"The work of laying the first section of
the cable from California to Honolulu will
be started as soon as the cable can be
finished and shipped to the two starting
points of the section. This ought to take
about seventy-five days, and telegraphic
communication with Hawaii may confi
dently be looked for by early fall."
Mr. Mackay added that the United
States Government would have no pro
prietary interest in the Trans-Pacific ca
ble. In times of war the cable would be
turned over to the State, War and Navy
departments for Government business,
and Government messages would always
have precedence over all others.
Quick Communication With Nome.
SEATTLE, Nov. 27.â Special advices
from Nome state that Captain Hansen of
the Northern Commercial Company has
Instituted p. plan whereby that place may
communicate with the outside world in
six days' time. This plan embraces tele
graph communication, with only one
break in the line, which will be covered
by fast dog teams. The Nome cable runs
to St. Michael and from that point an
overland wire runs to Tanana. There the
break commences and extends to Eagle,
where the wire connects with Dawson.
Thence the line goes through the United
States and Canada.
Morrow's Slayers Plead.
PORTLAND, Nov. 27.â "Jack" Wade,
alias "Kid" McFadden, and W. H. Dal
ton, who are charged with the murder of
James B. Morrow last Thursday morning,
were arraigned in the Municipal Court to
day. Wade pleaded guilty to murder in
order that he may testify against Dalton
at the trial. Under the statutes Judge
Fraser of the Circuit Court will now be
the sole judge as to whether Wade is
guilty of murder in the first or the second
degree. Dalton pleaded not guilty. The
time for the trial will be set Friday.
Explosion in a Chair Car.
NEEDLES, Nov. 27.â When the overland

PORTO BELLO IS BOMBARDED.
Story of an American Who Was a
Prisoner on the Finzon.
COLON, Nov. 27.â An American named
Murphy relates the following story ' con
firming the report that the Government
gunboat General Pinzon fired on Porto
Bello: On Monday morning Murphy was
in an open boat bound for Playadonna
on a mining excursion. Besides himself
there were three Chinese and a Colombian
negro in the boat, which was commanded
by the colored man. When they were
passing Porto Beilo a boat containing sol
diers from the Pinzon, then at anchor off
Porto Bello, captured Murphy and his
companions. After they had been made
prisoners and while on their Vay to the
gunboat the General Pinzon fired many
shots at Porto Bello. On arriving on
board the gunboat Murphy learned that
no less than fifty shots had been fired at
Porto Bello. He also says from the gun
boat one or two of the largest houses of
the place could be plainly seen to have
been wrecked. Men from the Pinzon who
went ashore at Porto Bello said the town
was evacuated. Not a single Liberal waa
to be seen anywhere, all having fled on
the arrival of the Pinzon. Murphy asserts
that explosive bullets were used by the
Liberals, as one bullet brought on board
the Pinzon was subsequently exploded.
Murphy waa handed over to the officers
of the United States gunboat Marietta
when the Pinzon returned to Colon.
TRAFFIC IS NOT IMPEDED.
Belligerents Agree Not to Fight
While Trains Are Passing.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.â Assurances
have been given American naval officers
at Panama and Colon by the Governmen-t
and insurgent forces of Colombia that
fighting shall cease while trains are pass
ing. This information, cabled by Captain
Perry, commanding the battleship lowa,
is most satisfactory to the administration.
It is considered important, in view of the
claim advanced by the Colombian author
ities that they be allow-ed to transport
Government troops on trains leaving Pan
ama.
Captain Perry has declined to permit
the use of the railroad for this purpose.
The Colombian Government has supported
its claim by inviting attention to Ine con
tract under which the Panama Railroad
was constructed. This specifically author
izes the Government to use it for the
transportation of troops. While admitting
that the right is accorded the Government
by contract, the authorities here insist
that Colombia herself has given to the
United States authority to preserve the
free and uninterrupted transit of the istn
mus. This necessarily carries with it tfie
right to prevent the railroad from being
used as a battleground. If Government
troops were to use the railroad the in
surgents would be Justified in ripping up
the tracks to prevent the movement of
their enemj-'s forces.
Consul General Gudger, at Panama, re
ports that the Government forces were
generally successful in the fighting. He
added that trains were delayed.

NEWSBOY'S SHOUT SENDS
PROMINENT MAN TO DEATH
City Treasurer of Louisville Hears of the
Publication of a Sensational Story and
Amost Immediately Commits Suicide
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 27.â After
being offered by two newsboys an
evening paper which stated that
his books were under examination
by expert accountants, Stuart D.
Young, retiring City Treasurer of Louis
ville, to-night went to the rear of a ware
house at Sixth and Nelson streets and
committed suicide by shooting himself be
hind the right ear with a pistol.
The publication in an evening paper of
a sensational story saying in substance
that accountants were at work on the
books of the retiring Treasurer, and that
it was reported that discrepancies had
been found In his accounts, caused a great
stir throughout the city. Immediately the
friends of Young began to look for him,
not believing the reports. They were sur
prised at being unable to find him. They
hoped for the best, however, because the
reports could not be substantiated, and
the expert accountants refused to make
a statement.
Shortly after 6 p. m. Young was seen
at the ladies' entrance of the Louisville
Hotel, on Main street, where he lived with

There has been !onsiderable interest created in
our $10 made-to-order suits. Many a customer has
told his friend of the good value he has received. One
order has followed another. The satisfaction does not
come from the price alone, but from the suit itself. It
is stylishly cut, neatly trimmed, carefully tailored and
well made from seasonable all-wool material. It is a
good business suit and answers this purpose very^vell
for that class of peopb who are willing to disregard
prejudice against a 'ow priced suit and consider $10 an
economical price when the clothes are really good in
every particular. ,
We are pleased to give samples of these

hackman named Johnston, whose carriage
stands in front of the hotel.
Johnston was acquainted with Young,
and, following the direction given by the
newsboys, passed between the boxcars
and brought up under a covered driveway
in the rear of J. M. Robinson, Norton &
Co.'s, just east of the Union station. Here
he saw Young lying face downward in
the cinders, his right arm under him.
Johnston shook the form of the man, not
suspecting he had killed himself. Seeing
a bullet hole behind Young's right ear,
Johnston turned the body over. Then he
saw a pistol in Young's right hand. Life
was extinct.
Stuart R. Young was 35 years old and
one of me most prominent men In Louis

shown a shortage of $23,000.
SPOUSE LEAVES
CARRIE NATION
Husband of the "Smash
er" Given Divorce in
Kansas.
MEDICINE LODGE, Kans., Nov. 27.â
David K. Nation was to-day granted a
divorce from his wife, Mrs. Carrie Na
tion, "the joint smasher." The court ex
onerated Mrs. Nation from the charge of
cruelty to her husband and divided the
property. The Medicine Lodge home will
go to Nation and the outlying property to
his former wife.
In reply to questions of the court, Mrs.
Nation said that the reason she fought
the proceedings was that she wished to
continue to share the pension money
drawn by her. husband. Nation, in sup
port of his petition for divorce, cited a
letter from his w.fe in which she had
denounced him as a "hell-bound hypo
crite." He charged that she did not at
tend to his wants.
Judge Gillett granted the divorce on
the ground of gross neglect of duty.
When Mrs. Nation first started out on
her career of joint smashing a year ago
Nation seemed to be in sympathy with
her raids. But when s.ie spent all of he
time away from home crusading or serv
ing sentences In jail, for destroying prop
erty he went to44>e.hbrÃe of hlg daughter
In Indiana and lived. He was Mrs. Na
tion's second husband and is nearly 70
years of age. The couple had lived to
gether for marry years.

EAGER TO AVOID
DUTY AS JURORS
Modoc Citizens Fear In
curring Wrath of
Lynchers.
ALTURAS, Nov. 27.â During the after
noon session of court in the case of the
people vs. James W. Brown, the alleged
leader of the Lookout lynchers, Henry
Kober, who was being examined as a
talesman, declared positively that under
no circumstances would he bring in a ver
dict of guilty on purely circumstantial
evidence, especially where the punishment
was death. Kober said that he was op
posed to the prosecution of the lynchers
and his answers to questions indicated
that he was anxious to escape jury duty.
He was challenged by Attorney Post for
the prosecution and excused.
The answers given by all the veniremen
who have been examined up to this time
indicate that they are anxious to avoid
serving on this jury and that they con
sider it a disagreeable task. Taking into
consideration the excitement and talk the
crime occasioned and the vivid articles
published iv some of the leading dailies
of the State it is almost impossible to find
a man who has not formed an opinion
and much harder to find one hereabouts
who is not actually or by pretense in sym
pathy with the lynchers. As a conse
quence the prosecution is at a disadvant
age.
The fifth man examined this afternoon
was F. S. McElwain. In answer to a
question from counsel for the defendant
he said that he was convinced that Martin
Wilson was murdered at Lookout, Modoc
County, on May 31; that Defendant Brown
was a constable and had charge of the
prisoner, and that, therefore, all that
would have to be proved by the prosecu
tion was that Brown aided and abetted
the murderers of Wilson.
Raker for the defense challenged the
juror on the ground of a state of mind
prejudicial to the defendant and the chal
lenge was denied by Sturtevant for the
people on the ground that the juror did
not understand the question as asked by
counsel for the defense. Under questions
from Sturtevant McElwain. as had the
talesman before him, said that he would
not vote to convict on circumstantial evi
dence. The defense here withdrew the
challenge and Sturtevant challenged the
juror for prejudice. McElwain was ex
cused.
Only three jurors have been chosen since
Monday. Court adjourned to-night until
9:30 o'clock on Friday morning and the
examination of veniremen will then be
continued.

MEXICO HANDS
OVER MURDERER
Grants the Extradition
of Slayer of Yuma
Woman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ PHOENIX. Ariz., Nov. 27.â A message
received to-day by Governor Murphy set
tles finally and amicably a question aris
ing through a request for extradition of
! a criminal from Mexico, which for a sea
son assumed an international character.
There is a treaty between this country
and Mexico- authorizing the Governors of
the Northern States of that republic to
honor requisitions from the Governors of
border States in this country without the
necessity of referencfe to the Federal Gov
ernment, its object being to further the
hasty punishment of criminals along th*
border. About two years ago Guillermo
Lisalda killed a woman in Yuma and fleu.
He remained concealed in Arizona unttl
a couple of months ago, when he was
located in Sonora. Requisition papers
on Governor Yzabel of that State were
obtained from Governor Murphy, and
Sheriff Livingstone of Yuma County went
after his man.
Governor Yzabel preferred not to act at
once and submitted the question to the
Federal Government In Mexico Cltv.
Livingstone reported to the American
Consul in Nogales, and that official to tha
State Department, which, through the
American Erabassador. presented the
facts to the Mexican Government.
In the meantime Lisalda had set up a
claim to Mexican citizenship, saying he
was born there. This for a time put a
different phase on the case, national in its
aspect. Sheriff Livingstone produced evi
dence of the falsity of the prisoner's
statement, as he was born In Arizona.
Governor Yzabel yesterday announced
that he had been instructed to deliver
Lisalda to the proper American authori
ties.
The incident is important as showlnar,
the intent of the Mexican Government to
abide strictly by the treaty, the pro
visions of which are a guarantee of law
and order on the border.

Oakland and Sacramento Baseball
Teams Will Close the Season
Here This Week.
This is the last week of the most suc
cessful baseball season in California since
the days of the Halght-street grounds.
Notwithstanding that the local team took
a big lead in the race some weeks ago,
and that it was a foregone conclusion
they would win the championship, there
has been scarcely any perceptible dimin
ution of interest. It has been success
fully demonstrated that hot rivalry is not
altogether necessary to attract the lovers
of the game. The work of many of the
players has attracted the attention of
Eastern magnates, with the result that
the California team /111 lose some good
players. The managers are not worrying.
They are confident they will be able to fill
the vacancies with talent of superior
merit. The scramble for new material is
already on.
The Oaklands and Sacramentos are
scheduled to wind up the season here.
This series will be followed by some ex
hibition games with crack teams repre
senting the American Association and
National League. The first of these will
be played a week from Saturday by the
San Francisco team and the aggrega
tion headed by the great Lajoie. The

Finishâ Four Favorites Finish in Front at Oakland Track
JUST a little bit of hard racing luck
cost Green Morris' good two-year
old Sombrero the so named Flying
handicap at Oakland yesterday.
Frank O'Nell, who had the mount,
was bothered and compelled to take up
his mount soon after the start from, the
five and a half furlong post and again in
the stretch the lightweight was tem
porarily blocked. While all this was
transpiring Johnny Woods gave Mee
hanus, the top weight, a very artistic
piloting, winning ridden out from the
Morris colt by less than a length. Fight-
Ing it out for the place with Sombrero,
and beaten only a head, came Hilee, the
St. Louis sprinter, piloted by Jess Mat
thews, Frank Bell was asked to do too
much in conceding three pounds to Mee
hanus and was not a factor at the close.
Sombrero opened favorite at 3 to 2, but
when the Meehanus coin made its appear
ance the ring began slashing and the lat
ter went to the post first choice.
Near the rail the going was heavy and
the different winners were ridden wide,
where the track had dried out consider
ably. Favorites captured all but two
events.
Walter Jennings' Prestano was Installed
favorite for the opening two-year-old
scramble, but was cut off at the start
and never had a chance. In swinging
Botany away from the barrier about
everything else In the race was interfered
with and the good thing won by himself,
backed from 6 to 3Ms- Marelio downed
Bendara for the place.
It will take quite a smart horse to beat
Hungarian in his present form. The
chestnut sprinter, with Mounce on his
back, closed favorite over Midnight
Chimes for the six-furlong spin which
followed, and ran under mild restraint all
the way. Midnight Chimes, always the
contender, led King Dellis out for the
place. , ._.
There could be no cause for complaint
at the price laid about El Oriente in the
betting on the mile selling run. Four to 5
looked a liberal quotation and the Bald
win horse scored cleverly at the wire.
Nellie Forest at one stage held the lead,
but found the route to far, eventually
losing the place in a drive to Tony Lep-
Owing to an accident met with by Rio
de Altar the field in the seven-furlong
purse run was reduced to three starters.
Maresa opened favorite over Miss Mac
Day, but before bugle call the latter mare
ruled choice. Mounce had the mount on
Miss Mac Day and when ready ran over
Maresa, winning under a choking pull.
Sylvan Lass lacked speed to keep up.
Spencer and Bullman hooked up in the
final mile and a hundred yard run, "The
Iceman," on Lodestar, while Bullman had
the leg up on Herculean. The last men
tioned horse made all the running to the
stretch, where Lodestar challenged. It
was a battle royal to the wire, Lodestar
scoring by three parts of a length. The
favorite, Bonnie Lissak. was third.
Track Notes.
With the arrival of more riding talent
and several new bookmaking firms the
sport at Oakland can now be considered
fairly launched. Nineteen firms cut in
yesterday and the odds laid were good.
Strongoli died at the track yesterday
morning. The big gelding was a member
of William Murry's string and waa in
jured some days ago, throwing out a stifle.
El Oriente showed unmistakable signs
of lameness, which caused the price
against the Baldwin horse to strike 6 to 5.
His race was not a striking one, but for
tunately for his backers there was noth
ing starting worth a Confederate bill.
Winnie O'Connor did not accept a
mount yesterday and won't for some
days â at least he says so. It seems Win
nie is tired of hearing it said that he stays
up late at nights carousing and will take a
rest.
â¢ Rio de Altar, from the Baldwin stable,
met with a severe accident on the track
yesterday morning. While the sprinter
was being galloped he bolted to the out- !
side fence in the stretch and cut a gaping j
wound in his side. Twenty or thirty
stitches were necessary to sew up the
cuts.
Johnny Woods and Owen Mounce each
had two winning mounts to their credit.
Spencer's finish, on Lodestar in the last j
race showed "The Iceman" to be a long
way from a "has been."
The feature of the holiday card to-day
is the $2500 Thanksgiving day handicap.
The field, which is a very select one, Is
bound to insure a splendid contest.

TERRY McGOVERN SURE
HE CAN DEFEAT CORBETT
The Sturdy Featherweight Cham
pion Will Defend His Title This
Afternoon at Hartford, Conn.
HARTFORD, Conn., Nov. 27.â The fight
for the featherweight championship of
the world between Terry McGovern of
Brooklyn, the present holder of the title,
and Billy Rothwell, better known as
"Young Corbett," of Denver, which Is to
take place to-morrow afternoon before
the Nutmeg Athletic Club, has caused un
usual stir In this city.
When seen at his quarters this even-
Ing "Young Corbett" said: "I feel fine. I
am away below the weight limit or I
would not be eating so heartily. I will
weigh in all right at 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning. I am not underrating my op
ponent when I say I believe I will win."
Terry McGovern, with his manager,
Sam Harris, and a retinue of trainers and
rubbers, arrived here from New York at
10:30 o'clock to-night. They were accom
panied by a host of New York sporting
men, who ran around the neighborhood
with wads of bills in their hands looking
for Corbett money.
"Two to one, McGovern," was their
cry, but there was no resopnse.
McGovern got away from his party
quickly and was soon in >ns .apartments
at a hotel.
He said: "I am in perfect shape. I am
not worrying about all the reports of Cor
bett's fitness. Let him be good and fit. I
will be the same. There will be no
trouble; you will see a good fight, and I
know I 'will be the winner."

the blood - coming in contact with the
skin and producing great redness and in-

MADAME SEMBRICH
AGAIN TRIUMPHANT
Double Bill, "Don Pasquale" and "I Pagliaeei,"
Draws Big Crowd â Eames and Calve Say
That They Will Sing.
TEX to one If you were to ask the
next man who heard "Don Pas
quale" last night for whom he
would vote as the next President
he would reply rapturously Â¦'Sem
brich! Sembrich'. there Is none
other!" The town has pone Sembrlch
mad. Last night the singer received a
welcome and aroused an enthusiasm that
remains unequaied in present day operatic
annals of "our town." Alter the curtain
fellâ l grew tired of keeping count how
many times â fair cantatrice came be
fore the footlights to attempt to stem the
torrent of applause, but without the
slightest apparent effect for some Lime.
All her associates in the brilliant per
formance came with her and bowed, and
bowed, and bowed, while, like the famous
coyote, the house howled, and howled, and
howled. Only the relieving spectacle of
M. Flon, who was called for without ef
fect, bowing with the depth and persever
ance of a Mandarin in his conductor's
chair to the smiling diva, broke the spell,
and the tension of the enthusiasm flitted
away into light laughter.
But not even -'11 Barbiere" of Saturday
last, nor the classic performance of "Le
Nozze di Figaro" of this season compelled
the hosannahs that followed last night's
Eplendid effort. There was a large house,
now a synonymous fact with Sembrich
nights, and Mr. Grau looked as happy in
his stage box as if bronchial Calves, run
away Sandersons and missing Eameses
â¢were the merest figments of a dream.
The performance was one to cheer. It
was shiningly symmetrical, and to hear
thus given the merry, simple, unpreten
tious opera, making no demands on in
tellects working overtime in the struggle
Â¦ for daily butter, is a thing to have lived
not in vain for. Sembrich was in radiant
form. Her art grows more perfect with
each hearing, and her Norina from every
Fide was simply an impeccable perform
ance. The merry lilt of the music, the
eilish, dainty coquetry of the character,
were there to the last note and accent, in
every honeyed tone and gracious gesture.
To close she sang an interpolated aria
from "Linda," ana her voice floated and
soared into the operatic heaven of melody
that drew down the palm symphony that
followed. Sembrlch, is the great vocal
fact of the season, her every song a pure
delight and her art a triumph.
It was Scotti's chance, too, last night,
and not since his "Don Giovanni" of last
year has this most accomplished singer
been heard at his best. His smooth,
round voice did wonders with the part
of Dottore Malatesta, and its flexibility
vas never more admirably exhibited. He
also has the suave humor of the role in
delightful degree, filling in the picture
with full appreciation of Its sprightly fun.
There seas a singularly beautiful balance
between his and Mme. Sembrich's voice,
and the concerted work between them was
a marvel of ensemble. Tavecchia also
stands out strongly in the buffa role of
Don Pasquale, the tedious, prosy-credu
lous, economical, but good-hearted old
Serson who plays December to Xorina's
lay. if nJii .wjUMW <TF*W 'JfflfflW*li WM ff il * fl fo
Mr. Tavecchla's work is remarkable for
many things, not the least its excellent
judgment. He never oversteps the limit of
delicate buffoonery required by the con
ception, yet gives all its fat.unconscious
fun in generous measure. His parlando
is marvelojjsly good and as a piece of char
acter acting and singing nothing better
of the kind could be desired than Tavec
chia's Don Pasquale.
Mr Salignac's Ernesto was not up to
the pitch of the rest of the performance,
but was inoffensive. The compass of the
part ranges generally above him. w^iich
fact resulted in a general effect of voice
forcing throughout the role. Still, Mr.
Salignac, had his moments, pleasing
dramatically, and sometimes sounding a
truly melodious note.
The famous quartet was sung in a fash
ion to delight and amaze, and throughout
the concerted efforts were marked by a
fabulous efficiency. The orchestra, under
Â« M. Flon, did admirably, and the bit of
chorus work added to the evening's tri
umph. ...
The band wagon and circus jingle of "I
Pagliacci" came - curiously after "Don
Pasquale" â old and modern Italy in most
effective contrast. The "Prologue" in
Mr Campanari's gifted handling rang out
finely, splendidly; only we were all a
scrap disappointed because he didn'l
come out before the curtain to sing it.
His Tonio is among the things Mr. Cam
panari can best do, and he was almost at
his best in the part. Not quite.
It speaks well, indeed, for little Miss
Scheff that she was encored for her first
song, that came so near to Sembrich's

ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE superb double bill of "Don Pas
quale " and "I Pagliacci," as pre
sented by the Grau Company at
the Grand Opera-house last night,
resulted in the biggest triumph of
the season. From 7:45 p. m. until after
midnight a vast audience listened to the
remarkable musical offering and great en
thusiasm iirevailed.
Mme. Sembrich, who eajig the role of
Xorina in "Don Pasquale," was eiven a
series of ovations that discounted any
thing in a similar line that has taken
place in this city for years, while ail the
singers who appeared with her shared in
her triumph. Ihe cast in "1 Pagliacci"
was equally successful.
The audience was a brilliant one and
there was not a vacant seat in the theater,
while those who stood lined up two deep
in every available nook and corner.
The boxes, orchestra, dress circle and
paJco reservations were filled with society
people and the display of gowns and jew
els fairly dazzled the eye. The audience
was in a happy mood and so was the man
agement ot the opera company. Good
news was heard last night from Mmes.
Calve and Eames, both of whom will ap
pear this week, having assured Manager
Grau that they have recovered from their
indispositions. Sybil Sanderson, however,
is still on the sick list and the matinee of
"Romeo et Juliette" has been abandoned
for to-day.
The loooy and foyer of the opera-house
was crowded last night between the acts
as it has never been before this season.
The topic of conversation was the bril
liant success of Sembrich, Scotti, Tav
ecchia, Vannl and Salignac in the Don
izetti opera and the dramatic effectiveness
of Scheff, De Marchi, Declery, Reiss and
Campanari in Leoncavallo's tragic com
position.
All tire artists were given numbers of
curtain calls after each act, and, though
the curtain twice descended while recalls
were being made, the audience laughed
heartily and continued to call for its fa
vorites.
A dczen times was Madame Sembrich
brought to the footlights, and when she
kissed her hands to the house and sig
naled Conductor Flon to repeat an aria
hundreds of men and women joined in a
mighty shout of "Bravo!" Memories of
Bianci and Patti were awakened by
Madame Sembrich, who last night again
demonstrated that she is the greatest
singer in tha world.
Manager Grau desires that the public
be assured that Calve and Eames will
sing this week. The news that Calve
would not sing again this season was dcV
nied by the diva herself in telegrams to
Grau. She wired him in the afternoon
from Pasadena that she would be in San
Francisco to-morrow and desired seats
for the evening performance. Grau kept
the wires busy and informed Calve that
all kinds of statements were being pub
lished in San Francisco and Eastern
cities concerning her illness. In reply to
Grau's telegrams Calve sent him the fol
lowing message:
No tri'th in the news sent from Pasadena.
Am feeding much better. I leave to-morrow
evening and wMI be in San Francisco on Fri
day morning. I will positively sing on Satur
day evening.
The physicians in attendance on
Madame Eames saw the singer last even
ing and announced that she had quite re
covered from her cold. The diva sent
word to Grau last night that she will
positively sing to-morrow night In
"Aida."
To-night "Die Meistersinger" will be
repeated with its great cast of Wagner
ian singers. Sembrich is to be heard
again on Saturday afternoon in "II Bar
biere di Siviglla," and "Carmen" with
Calve is the attraction for Saturday
night.
ANOTHER CALVE REPORT.
Pasadena Message Says Diva Will
Not Return To-Morrow.
The assurance given by Madame Calve
to Manager Grau that she has recovered
her health and will positively Bing in
"Carmen" on Saturday night does not
agree with the press reports received last
evening from Pasadena,
According to a telegraphic dispatch re
ceived from Pasadena last night Madame
Calve has given orders to the manage
ment of the Hotel Green that no cards be
f*nt tp her rooms save those of her per
sonal friends. During the early part of
her visit In Pasadena the diva went out
daily, visiting points of interest and
shopping. One day she spent on Mount
Lowe. During the past two days Calve
has kept to her rooms and has had all
her meals sent up to her apartments. The
telegram concludes as follows:
Mme. Calve was to have returned to San
Francisco on Friday, but she has now can
celed that date and has not announced to the
hotel' management when she will Jeave.

in the blacksmith business with an elder
brother named Henry. Later they re
ceived a Government contract for 100
wagons, which was executed to the en
tire satisfaction of the Government. This
gave them, a start, and from that time
the firm grew to its present large propor
tions. In 1868 the company was incor
perated as the Studebaker Bros. Manu
facturing Company, with Clem Studebak
er as president.

PRO-CHINESE SENTIMENT.
ACCORDING tc the Washington correspon
dent of the Boston Transcript there has been
already manifest at the national capital a
strong sentiment in opposition to the re-enactment
of the Chinese exclusion law. He does not under
take to say how formidable the opposition will
prove itself to be when the lines of actual battle are
drawn, but he. asserts that in the opp^ition this time
there will be found elements that were not hitherto
opposed to exclusion, and consequently the strength
is likely to be greater than ever.
Among the forces that are expected to oppose
exclusion are the steamship companies plying be
tween the United States and China, Southern em
ployers bi labor who are dissatisfied with the negro,
manufacturers who have goods to sell in the Chinese
market, and merchants in all the large cities. It is
said that we have now a good chance to extend our
trade in China, but that the exclusion law acts
against us in that respect, inasmuch as it inflicts
upon the Chinese indignities which they resent.
Speaking the sentiments of the merchants the writer
says: "Our trade with the Chinese must develop
very slowly if always subject to the handicap of the
necessity of carrying our goods to them on the
chance of their being willing to purchase, whereas if
every' facility were offered for the free admission of
themselves to come here and see what we have to
sell a large commerce would soon grow up between
the two countries."
One of the most instructive features of the article
is the forecast of the tactics that will probably be
adopted by the opponents of exclusion if they find
themselves powerless to defeat it outright. It is
said that a compromise will be offered. It is known
that the coming session of Congress will be very
bus}', for it has many great questions to deal with.
A prolonged fight on the exclusion bill would inter
fere with the legislation for the Philippines, the isth
mian canal bill, the reduction of taxes and other mat
ters hardly less important. Taking advantage of-that
fact, a proposition will be made to have tlfe exclusion
bill go over until next term. As the present law ex
pires by limitation in May, that would leave seven or
eight months in which the Chinese would have full
freedom to enter the country, and would afford a
test of what might be expected should exclusion be
set aside altogether.
Commenting upon the desirability of making the
experiment of a limited season of unrestricted Chi
nese immigration the writer says: "If all the pas
senger-carrying companies were to stretch their
traffic to the extreme they could not bring an aggre
gate greater than 4000 or 5000 a month, so that 30,000
or 40,000 Chinese would be the outside number who
could take advantage of the opening. This would not
be a sufficient multitude to do any harm to white
labor through competition; and probably the bulk of
it would be absorbed so quickly in channels already
cleared and waiting that the only effect the working
men would see would be an increased development
in certain industries, from which they would ulti
mately reap the greater benefit, since everything pro
duced by Chinese labor would have to be boxed and
hauled and shipped to various markets, and in these
lines Chinese labor has never begun to compete with
white at all."
Such are the forces we shall have to meet this win
ter, and such is the plan they will probably adopt in
making their fight. It is well to be forewarned.
Our representatives can be counted on to stand
firmly for exclusion. Their motto should be, "No
compromise."
We are now being told by many papers that "visit
ors to the exposition at Charleston have been aston
ished at the magnitude of the scheme of construction
and the magnificence with which it has been carried
out" ; but we have heard that before about other ex
positions.
It is stated that for the third year in succession
the book trade in .London has fallen flat on account
of the war, so it is no wonder the literary fellows are
howling for peace.
CHIEF WITTMAN'S ACTIVITY.
â¢~>HIEF WITTMAN has taken such vigorous.
I and well directed measures for the suppres
sion of pool-selling that there is now a fair
prospect the evil will be greatly diminished, if not
absolutely stopped. At any rate, the pool-sellers will
have to carry on their illicit trade so secretly it will
be no longer an enticement and a temptation to the
youth of the city and to the public generally.
The supervision exercised by the police over the
cigar trade has had its good effect already. The pool
sellers who used the cigar business as a mask be
hind which to carry on the sale of pools have found
themselves exposed and will be compelled to give
up the 'practice. The results will in the end be bene
ficial to the legitimate cigar trade, and the annoy
ance of the supervision will be overlooked by reason
of the benefits that flow from it. That much is so
well understood by legitimate dealers who have never
made a practice of pool-selling that they may be
counted among the firmest supporters of the reso
lute policy of the Chief.
The activity of the police in the suppression of
pool-selling comes at a most opportune time. There
have been reports of late of the intention, or at least
the desire, of certain parties to reopen Ingleside
track for racing, with the accompaniment of book
making. It is just as well to have any such move
ment stopped at once. San Francisco has had ample
experience of the results of unlimited racing and
track gambling at Ingleside, and has not' forgotten
the lesson taught by the experience. The public still
retains the memory of some at least of the many de
falcations, embezzlements, forgeries, robberies, mur
ders, suicides and other crimes resulting from the
gambling mania acquired at the track. Many a home
in the city has been blighted by those crimes and
well nigh every class of people have been affected by
them.
It is to be borne in mind that the movement for
the reopening of Ingleside does not mean
merely a resumption of racing. To that there
would be no objection. In fact, under the
law the management of the track has a right
to hold races there at this time if it should
choose to do so. The objection is to book-making
and to other forms of gambling at the track.
Horse-racing, inasmuch as it tends to promote the j
breeding of fine horses, is in itself good. The evil |
lies in the gambling that accompanies it. The fight,
therefore, is not in any sense a fight agamst racing
any more than against horse-breeding. It is directed
exclusively to the prevention- of gambling.
It matters not in the least whether the proposal for
reopening Ingleside ccme from the present manage
ment of the track or from any other man or set of
men. The objection is to the track gambling itself,
and not to any particular management. â¢ The fact that
one set of men might run it more properly than an
other does not count in the problem. If the track
be reopened and bookmaking or other forms of gam
bling be permitted there the results arc bound to be
similar to those which in the past roused the moral
sense of the whole community and brought about
that crusade against the evil which led to *ts sup
pression. Under no circumstances, then, should
there be permitted a revival of track gambling at
Ingleside. Upon that issue the better elements of the
people should be united and resolute. It is one upon
which there should be no compromise.
It is not to be overlooked that one of the best
methods of putting a stop to the proposed movement
for reopening Ingleside track will be that of
strengthening the hands of Chief Wittman in his ef
forts to suppress the illitit pool-selling that has been
going on in the city. Should the support given to
Wittman be openly and emphatically pronounced the
men who have been promoting the scheme for re
opening Ingleside will see at once that their efforts
would meet with an overwhelming resistance and
they will abandon it. On the other hand, if the ef
forts of the police against the existing practice of
pool-selling be coldly received, the Ingleside
schemers will conclude that sentiment is no longer
averse to their scheme and they will be correspond
ingly encouraged to undertake it. Chief Wittman's
activity comes, therefore, opportunely. It will not
only put a stop to existing pool-selling, but check
a scheme to set up bookmaking within the city. The
Chief, then, is doing the right thing in the right
way and at the right time. It is the duty of all good
citizens to sustain him.
Roosevelt is said to have told the Republican sup
porters of various candidates for Kentucky appoint
ments that they could have a day in which to reach
an agreement. The next day they asked for a week,
whereupon he told them he would make the appoint
ment^ himself, and he did. To the politicians the
method seemed sudden, but the people will perceive
in it nothing more than promptness, and approve it.
THE YEAR'S IMMIGRATION
COMMISSIONER POWDERLY'S report
of immigration during the last fiscal year
show* that the total steerage arrivals num
bered 487,918, being an increase of 39,346, or approxi
mately nine per cent, over the arrivals of last year.
In addition to the steerage immigrants there were
during the year 74,950 alien cabin passengers who en
tered the country, making the total for the year
562,868. ,\
A study of the report shows something in the way
of improvement, but still there remains a good deal
that is far from satisfactory. One of the gratifying
features is the announcement that the character of
the immigration is much higher than it has been in
recent years. Thus the number of intending immi
grants who were rejected was considerably less than
last year, notwithstanding the increase in the total
number who arrived. On the other hand it is noted
that among the persons admitted there were 117,587
who could neither read nor write, and thejr general
poverty was such that 294,860 had less than $3Q each
on their arrival.
The classification of the immigrants as to race and
nationality shows that there arrived from Italy
135,996, from Austria-Hungary 113,300, from Russia
85,257, from Ireland 30,561, from Sweden 23,331, from
Germany 21,665, from Norway 12,248 and from Great
Britain 12,214. The majority of the immigrants gave
as their destination the States of Illinois, Massachu
setts, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. Com
paratively few were going to the South or coming
to the far West. Most of them are going to districts
where they have relatives or friends already estab
lished.
The fact that so large a proportion of the new
comers had less than $30 each is a proof of the pov
erty from which they have sought to escape, and
also of the low standard of living to which they
have been accustomed. Many of them indeed have
been almost forced tc emigrate from their former
homes by the pressure of taxation upon the scant
revenues derived from their profits or wages. Ameri
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 28. 1901.
can influences will of course do much for many of
the newcomers, but the strain they will put upon the
labor market is certain to be severe in some com
munities.
Discussing the relation of immigration to the labor
market and to the general welfare of the country
the commissioner says:
"To deal with the problem successfully it seems in
dispensable to remove as far as possible these con
ditions which conflict with the incorporation of the
alien element into the social system of the country, so
that by actual experience the former may learn as
soon as possible that the basis and foundation of the
American polity are a respect and affection for and a
willing obedience to the laws and customs of the land,
because the maintenance of those laws is the best
safeguard of individual liberty. It is therefore recom
mended that Congress enact suitable legislation, either
with or if necessary without thÂ£ co-operation of the
States, for the purpose of distributing the alien popu
lation with some reference to the industrial law of
supply and demand."
It is probably the proposed legislation-would prove
advantageous to all concerned. It is at any rate
one of the recommendations which merit considera
tion when the whole subject of our immigration law
is taken up for revision, and that is a task which
ought to be attended to promptly.
The Governor of Minnesota declares that the re
cent railroad combination between Hill and Morgan
constitutes a "consolidation of the roads," and is
therefore a violation of the law; but the managers of
the combine declare they have provided only for a
"consolidation of control," and it is over thÂ« differ
ence between those two ideas that the fight is going
to be waged.
THERE is a differengs between fervor and
furore. Fervor may 6e legitimate earnestness
in a legitimate cause. Furore, on the other
hand, may be inconsiderate zeal in a legitimate cause.
The world has been furnished two recent instances of
religious furore in which its use and action were in
direct opposition to the spirit of the cause which it
professed to serve.
The first had for its scene the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher at Jerusalem. What a center of Christian
zeal has that venerable structure been! It caused
the Crusades. Peter the Hermit so aroused the zeal
of Christian Europe against its possession by the in
fidel Saracen that vast armies moved to its rescue,
chanting and praying as they marched. Â¦Even chil
dren caught the spirit of the Hermit, and there is no
more pathetic incident in history than the mobilizing
of a great company of children which marched
toward Jerusalem and evaporated by disease and
death long before it sr.w the land of the infidel or the
domes of the Savior's sepulcher. Later on, according
to Kinglake, a quarrel between two sects of Chris
tians over the repairs to the roof of the holy struc
ture was the cause of the Crimean war, in which
human valor inscribed a new chapter in the history
of man's courage and sacrifice.
The last and recent contention seems like a descent
from the sublime to the ridiculous. Two bodies of
Christians have been disputing for the privilege of
sweeping and dusting the church. The Mahometan
Governor of Jerusalem, fearing trouble, had posted
troops around the sacred edifice to keep the peace.
The two contending parties of Christians, apparently
by agreement, beset the infidel soldiers by surprise
and whipped them. Then the followers of the Prince
of Peace fell upon each other in a bloody battle, in
which some were killed and many wounded. The
rival forces began to receive recruits from their re
spective partisans, and the war was only ended when
there appeared a sufficient farce of the followers of
the Son of Abdallah to stop the believers in the Son
of Mary from killing each other. Just which side
won the right to sweep and dust the church is not
told in the chronicle of the furore.
The incident is a sufficient commentary on the per
verted view of Christianity held by the partlts who
furnished it. If it had occurred in the Mosque of
Omar, or in the temple of_ Buddha in Lhassa, we
would have summoned our Christian pride and
pointed to it as the natural manifestati^p of the fail
ure of a false religion in the restraining of human
passion. But as the scene was the center of. the
Christian cult, the holiest of all its places, what can
we say?
No sooner had this furore been quelled by the
troops of the Prophet than another bloody one broke
out in Athens among the Christians who adhere to
the Greefc rite. It was proposed to translate the- New
Testament into modern Greek, as it is translated and
used by Catholic and Protestant Christians in all the
other modern languages. For a reason not stated
the university students in Athens opposed this inno
vation. They insisted that the sacred books should
remain in ancient Greek only. This seems unnatural,
for students are supposed to be intelligent and pro
gressive. The ancient Greeks were not intolerant in
religion. Their education was purely secular, but
they were the first ancient people to tolerate all
forms of religion. In Athens, moved by a commend
able spiritual hospitality; they built a shrine to every
god they could hear of, worshiped by the nations
around them* near and far, whose people might visit
their. city and desire to* worship the home deity.
Lest any should be forgotten they built an altar to
"The unknown god," and when St. Paul preached
on Mars Hill and was asked what god he worshiped
he answered in his provincial Greek, "The unknown
god," though not in that exact phrase.
I The students who show such, zeal for the ancient
language as a medium for the New Testament seem
to forget. utterly this fine spirit of toleration which
honored the men who made that language. They
raised a riot and rallied on the ruins of the Temple
of Jupiter Olympus and fought the police, until a
mob of twenty thousand took part and seven were
killed and a large number wounded. When driven
off, the students barricaded the university and held
it against all comers.
The incident is a mixture of tragedy and comedy.
If the gods of Olympus were real gods, though tem
porarily retired from business, how they must have
been amused looking down from the classic height
upon the" furore and murder going on where the
Temple of Jupiter stood in the time of Pericles.
Imagine Mercury bringing the latest news of the
fight, while Jupiter and Juno, with Venus, Neptune,
Vulcan and the rest, listened as Diana read the bulle
tins and the Muses sang ragtime ditties full of local
"hits" uncomplimentary to their modern successors
in Attica! *
Boss Croker has announced that he wishes "vindi
cation," and that he will stay in politics with Tam
many until he gets it. It would seem from this that
the old man has lost his head, for vindication is a
hard thing for a politician of his type to find any
where, and it is a sure thing he will never get it from
the public by playing with Tammany.

THEODORE ROOSEVELT, Presi
dent of the United States, called
severaKdays ago at a flat in New
York City where Mrs. Mary Led
with, an old family servant, Is ill.
His act was due to the concern which he
felt for the welfare of the woman who
had been the nurse of his children and of
their mother. Mrs. Ledwith had been in
charge of the President's boys and girls
ever since they were born. Before that
she was in the family of Mrs. Roosevelt,
who was Miss Edith Kermit Carow. Mrs.
Ledwith had endeared herself to two gen
erations of the family and she is looked
upon as an important member of the
household.
Mrs. Ledwith came from Ireland when
a girl. She is related to well known fami
lies of the Emerald Isle and is a woman
of education and refinement. Her posi
tion in the President's household is that
of nurse and nursery governess. She is
now 76 years old.
She lost her husband early in life and
forty-five years ago was engaged by the
family of MrÂ». Roosevelt. On account of
her faithfulness and intelligence she be

New Buffalo Bill.
Uncle Sam will soon issue a new ter
dollar greenback, which will be a novel
"buffalo bill." The design for the new
treasury note was drawn by a celebrate i
artist and student of animal nature who
is connected with the National Smith
sonian Institution. Several weeks ago it
was engraved by one of the most skillful
artisans employed at the Bureau of En
graving and Printing. Its chief feature
is the representation of a buffalo bull,
with bent head and outstretched tail, on
a prairie of sage grass, in the position of
pawing for food. The note has been so
designed that about as much white wiil
show as is now visible on the silver cer
tificates of 1899.
After the Gage method adopted tyro
years ago, conspicuous numerals will be
used on the face of the bill. The buffalo
bill will be the fourth of a series of five
bills which Secretary Gage planned to
have issued after a di3tlnct American
type. The first three of the typical Amer
ican series were the $1 silver certifi
cate, with the emblematic eagle, the $2
certificate, -with a portrait of George
Washington on its face, and the $5 certifi
cate, showing the head of an Indian. The
fifth and last of the series will have en
graved on the front and back portraits of
Meriwether Lewis and Captain William
Clarke, the American explorers.
Chamois D.sappearing.
The chamois is another animal that
seems doomed to extinction.' The com
plete disappearance of the pretty animal
from the French Alps Is seriously threat
ened, and the scientific papers are calling
for measures that will protect it. The
chamois makes its refuge and home in
the most inaccessible piaces, and heights
varying from 2500 to 11,500 feet, and yet
the gun mercilessly hunts it out and
shoots It down. There is a large reserve
In Italy on which the animal is protected,
and it is suggested that the same means
be aaoDted in France.
came indispensable. She was nurse to
Mrs. Roosevelt in childhood and later,
when the young mistress went to Europe,
Mrs. Ledwith accompanied her. She went
with Mrs. Roosevelt after her marriage
and has been with her ever since.
When the President was Civil Service
Commissioner and later when he was As
sistant Secretary of the Navy Mrs. Led
with accompanied the family to Washing
ton. She was a familiar figure in the
streets of the capital, where she was fre
quently seen driving with the Roosevelt
children.
Mrs. Ledwith contracted a severe cold
at the inauguration of President McKin
ley last March, from which she has never
quite recovered. She is now at the home
of her sister, Mrs. Mary Flynn, who lives
at JSO East Forty-eighth street. She is
under the care of a trained nurse sent to
her by the President. It is reported that
she is regaining her health. It is expected
that she will be able to return to Wash

Mrs. Roosevelt has also called to see
Mrs. Ledwith and sends frequently to in

IN ASYLUM CELL
Warrant Officer Deigan
Is Sent to Ukiah
Hospital.
Sickness Dethrones the Rea
son of a Comrade of
Hobson.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VKIAH, Nov. 27.â Osborne Deigan, one
of the men who immortalized themselves
with Lieutenant Hobson by sinking the
collier I*errimac in the entrance to the
harbor of Santiago, with the object of
penning in the Spanish fleet, is an in
mate of the Ukiah Hospiial for the In
sane. He was brought to this city sev
eral days agot.
Deigan was recently attached to the
Mare Island navy-yard and given com
mand of the Vigilant. He served but a
day or two, when he was ordered upon
the sick list. After a serious illness his
mind was found to be affected, with the
result that he was committed to the asy
lum. It is believed that the young naval
hero's stay in the hospital will be only
temporary.
Delgan was a sailor on one of the ves
sels of the American fleet off Santiago
at the time volunteers were called for to
accompany Lieu tenant Hobson' on the
mission that apparently meant death
lor that brave young man and all who
accompanied him. He was eager to go
with Hobson, and was one of the first
men selected. Following the sinking of
the Merrimac, the capture of the daring
party o f Americans and their release from
a Spanish prison, President McKinley was
anxious to reward each of the young he
roes. Deigan was offered a cadetship in
the Naval Academy at Annapolis, but it
was found that he was ineligible. Then
he was appointed a boatswain in the
United States navy. The young officer
was personally complimented by Presi
dent McKinley for his g-allantry." His ap
pointment as a warrant officer was made
on April 5 of this year.

Jessie L. Paton Berry, wife of William
F. Berry, who is suing for divorce on the
ground of desertion and failure to pro
vide, appeared before Judge Hunt yester
iay and told her story. She said her hus
band deserted her in July, 1895, and that
since that time he had not furnished her
Rith sufficient means for her support.
Berry told a different tale, however, and
Judge- Hunt took the case under advise
ment. Berry, who is an accountant for
'.ercantile Trust Company, said he
educated his son, now a youth of 19, and
ihought that by doing so he was doing
:Â«eiter than he would if he gave his wife
fr.fficient only to board and cloth the en

The trial of the suit for divorce insti
tuted by Man,- E. Deane against Charles
F. Deane. for cruelty, was heard by

BRITISH SHIP GLAUCUS LOSES
MAN OVERBOARD IN MIDOCEAN
Boat Is Manned and Lowered in Seven Minutes, but Crew Fails
to Save Life of the .Unfortunate â Curacao Arrives From
Mexican Ports â Schooner Alexander Fails to Reach Fort Bragg
BRITISH SHIP GLAUCUS WHICH ARRIVED FROM ANTWERP YESTERDAY, MAKING THE BEST TIME OP
THE SEASON: SHE MADE THE RUN IN 129 DAYS, AND HER CAPTAIN SAYS HE WOULD HAVE BROK
EN THE RECORD HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE FOG.
AMONG the vessels arriving yester
day were the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company's Curacao
from Mexican ports, the schoon
er Alexander, that left here on
the 12th inst. for Fort Bragg, and the
British ship Glaucus, from Antwerp. The
latter made almost a record run, covering
the distance in 129 days. This is the best
run of the season, and has not been
beaten in years.
The Glaucus had an uneventful run,
save for the loss of one of the crew. The
accident occurred on July 31, last, when
the ship was in latitude 40 degrees north,
longitude 15 degrees west. L. Eriksen
fell overboard and, in spite of every ef
fort to save him, he was drowned. The
ship was hove to and a boat lowered in
seven minutes, but when it reached the
spot where the man was last seen all
that was left was his hat and a few bub
bles. He had gone down just as help was
at hand.
The Glaucus comes into port in first
class trim and after discharging will load
wheat for Europe.
Mexican Mail Boat Arrives.
The Curacao arrived from llexican
ports last night. She did not bring a
large passenger list, but among her cargo
was a lot of concentrates and bullion,
valued at more than a quarter of a mil
lion dollars. Those who came up on the
vessel were: Mrs. C. H. Ramirez, Miles
E. Stratton, F. W. Albrighton, Carlos S.
de la Toba, Carmen Jofre, Adelaida Jofre,
Antonio Perez, Francisco Arias and two
children, Estefa Bustamante. Asencion
Davis and three children, and Ramon
Miramontes.
The Curacao left the United States
training ship Alert in Magdalena Bay.
She was to leave that port for La Pas
on December 1. She will coal at the lat
ter place and then proceed to San Diego,
arriving about December 18.
- The Alexander Is Safe.
The four-masted schooner Alexander,
which was off port Tuesday night, sailed
in yesterday. She left here In tow of the
steam schooner National City for Fort
Bragg, and when off her (destination was
anchored because there was not enough
room in the harbor for her. The National
City went in and leaded, but during the
night a gale came up and the Alexander
had to slip her anchor and put to sea.
Captain Zahn says he was driven away
off shore and then beat his way back,
but ag there was no tug to help him he
could not make his way into the harbor
at Fort Bragg. He accordingly stood
away for San Francisco and made port
yesterday mojrning. At no time was the
schooner' in any danger, and she is now
getting ready to make a second attempt
to reach Fort Bragg in tow of the Na
tional City. Both vesels will sail to
morrow.
Accident on Ocean Wave.
The Santa Fe's ferry steamer Ocean
Wave will have to be laid up
for repairs. On the 8 a. m.
trip yesterday one of the cylinder
heads blew out and one of the deck
hands was slightly scalded by the escap
ing steam. The vessel's engines were
rendered useless, but the tugr Reliance
towed her to and from Point Richmond
during the day, so that there was no de
lay and no inconvenience. To-day the
Amador will take up the running until
the Ocean Wave is repaired.
Water Front Notes.
The Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday and awarded the con
tract to Healy, Tibbitts & Co. for the re
piling and repairing of the north side of
Folsom street wharf No. 2. The firm's
lvd was J2655. Bids for constructing a
shed over Union street wharf will be
opened December 11.
Edward Brown asserts that he was
robbed on the water front Tuesday night.
Two men, so he says, knocked him down
and rifled his pockets of $7. He reported
the occurrence to Officers McCormack
and Dower, but as he was under the in
fluence of liquor not much credence was
placed in his story. The police are inves
tigating the matter, however.
Reinsurance on the bark Prince Albert
was advanced -to 40 per cent yesterday.
The tug Monarch picked up a two and
one-half ton anchor off Black Point yes
terday. It had been located by some
wreckers and is deemed a good find.

William Collier and I his fine production of
"On the Quiet" will ' remain at the Colum

The ' comedy 'is one of the cleverest ever

the leading star in his line of work now
before the public. V- He Is exceedingly popu

thusiastic. Â¦-Â¦Â¦â¢?â¢ '. Â¦Â¦Â¦-Â¦' c â¢ -

heard Â¦ much '- of : , ; this successful . French
farce from the pen of the author of "The
Gay Parisians" and a crowded house will
be on hand Monday ' night .to greet Lena
Mervilie and the; other members of the
strong 'Cast appearing , in this amusing
work. Â¦;. "The Girl From Maxim's" has to
its credit a 1 long and successful run :at
the Criterion â¢ Theater, New York.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"The Geisha," ; the Tivoli's current bill,
is the best thing the Pollard children have
yet presented. It is staged to admiration^

the mountings Â¦Â¦. being of the : most â¢ satis
factory sort. . The , stage manager is . a
youth of 19, by - the way, . and his work is
.wonderful. Madge â¢ Woodson -is: as usual
a favorite in the cast; little Daphne is an
other tiny charmer, and JVillie Pollard

While the piece teems with good comedy
and side-splitting situations there is not a
vulgar line nor a suggestion of vulgarity
in the entire play. The advance sale

of interest and thrill and is done to- a
nicety by the clever members of the Al

each member has that to do which he can
best do. Charles Bryant in ? particular
shines and Miss Juliet Crosby is another
favorite .of the cast. Next week "An

boards. "We ' 'Uns of Tennessee" will

â¢ Cannot Withdraw Resignations.
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion yes
terday with the Police Commissioners ad
vising that he knows of no ground what
ever upon which permission could at thi3
time be given to an ex-officer to with
draw a resignation accepted by their pre
decessors in office. Lane says a member
of the force upon presenting his resigna
tion, and the same being accepted, ceases
to be a member of the department, and
the Police Board has no power to annul
thÂ« acceptance or permit the withdrawal
of the resignation, which would be tanta
mount to reinstatement on the force.
There is no question as to the power of
their predecessors, to accept a resigna
tion from the department, and such ac
ceptance must be regarded as final.

License on Automobile Operators.
The Board of Works recommended yes
terday to the Supervisors that no exami
nation or license be required of the ope
rators of any class of automobiles. The
board takes the stand that in examining
and licensing the operators the city, in
a measure, would take upon itself the
responsibility of insuring the fitness of
the licensee, thereby rendering itself to a
certain extent responsible for his or her
conduct; while placing an operator on
the same basis as any driver puts such
responsibility where it belongs and makes
the operator more careful, both of his
vehicle and of the safety of others.

APPEAL FOR AID
Schooner Long's Passen
gers Are Penniless
at Unalaska.
Seattle Chamber of Com
merce Will Move for
Their RelieÂ£
SEATTLE. Nov. 27.â Advices from thfc
north bring news that the long overdue
schooner P.alph J. Long from Nome lies
stranded at Unalaska with 115 passen
gers. The vessel's larders are empty and
the passengers have spent all their money
to obtain the absolute necessities of life,
and they now appeal for help to the War
Department.
L. Frank Brown, a lawyer of this city,
presented a resolution to the Seattla
Chamber of Commerce to-day, giving the
facts in the oase and urging the necessity
for immediate aid for the unfortunate
passengers and crew. The members of tho
chamber were unanimously in favor of
acting at once and a request will bo made
to the authorities in Washington, asking
them to send a revenue cutter or some
Government vessel to bring down the
starving people.
The l.ong lies at Unalaska without
stores and the passengers and crew are
practically_ penniless. The vessftl reached
the port on October 5 with neither food
nor water aboard. Since that time the
conditions have grown from bad to worse.
The storekeepers at that point refuse to
advance enough provisions to allow the
schooner to reach Puget Sound, and tha
passengers are afraid to venture out in
a helpless condition.
Sent to Prison for Forgeries.
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â Charles L. Rol
ler, a former real estate deaier of New
ark. N. J.. was to-day sentenced by a
court In that city to seven years' impris
onment at hard labor and to pay a fine
of $1000 for forgring notes to the amount
of $50,000, which he had discounted at
banks. After the forgeries Roller became
a fugitive from justice. He was arrested
in Portland, Or., but succeeded in satisfy
ing the authorities there that they had
the wrong man, and he was released.
Yesterday he appeared in Newark and
gave himself up. In court to-day he
pleaded non-vult to the indictment against
him.

- Have you dandruff? Then you have
a "contagious parasite disease, unpleas-
ant, unhealthy and one that will event-
j ually lÂ«ad to baldness. To cure It you
] must destroy the parasite that eats at
the root of the hair. The only prepara-
tion for destroying these germs is New-
bro's Herpicide. Charles Klein of Lar-
amie, Wyo., says: "Herpicide allayed
; the itching, cured the dandruff and
stopped my hair's falling out; and it is
bringing a new crop of hair." Herpicide
is free from grease or dangerous drugs,
and makes hair glossy and soft as silk.

Raisins, Currants and Prunes. .
Kail advices from New York say: "The ar
rival of the steamer Guildhall with further
supplies of currants has had no weakening
effect on the spot market. Cleaners and large
dealers, however, are again well supplied â¢ for
their immediate needs and as" a consequence
there Is less demand except in a small way.
Spot prices are held firm at 6c for Neptune i
and similar goods and 6%c for wedding cakes,
end all present indications are for a strong if
not higher market until after the holidays.
Â¦ Cables from Greece report a hardening market
there, due to reported buying by the Continent.
"Valencia layer raisins are In good supply.
owing to the large- receipts per Guildhall, an
selling freely at 6%c. California loose Mus- I
catels are quiet and easy. Seeded are easier, j
sales of new coast fancy seeded being reported j
at 7%c. Seedless Muscatels offer from 5%Â®6%c. j
Â¦with little doing. Prunes are offered at all :
sorts of prices on the coast, but Santa Claras
are held mostly from a 2%@3c basis. Some
bids at a T%c basis were reported turned down :
yesterday. It is understood there have been 1
a number of sellers of large sizes Santa Claras 1
during the early part of the week at a 2%c ,
basis, bat the impression now seems to be that :
no further lois are available at that figure.
California prunes are selling; fairly well on |
spot. Oregons are more plentiful and easier, :
and fairly active. Choice peaches are in quite 1
good demand from 7%@S%c Nuts of all kinds I
are very active. Tarragona almonds are higher I
at 10% c." v y 1

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
ICEW YORK, Nov. 27.â There was a good
deal of hesitation about speculation on the
Stock Exchange to-day. There were a num
ber, of. conspicuous- advances, which failed to
attract any considerable following or to re
flect any marked influence on the general list.
The selling pressure, however, was not acute
There was moderate realizing whenever the
strength of the market . permitted, but it was
not urgent and was not pushed at the expense
of values. The bears made an attack on : the
market late in the day, encouraged by the man
ifest hesitation of the buying and succeeded in
reducing the price level considerably, especially
at points where it had been advanced in the
morning. " The strong stocks were influenced
apparently by individual causes and their
movement was not accompanied by any .news
to explain it. Sugar was actively traded In
all day and was lifted* an extreme 3% . points.
Manhattan maintained its - recent aggressive
strength and advanced two points farther. '
General Electric added 7% points, but lost all
but one point of , the gain, before the close.
The recent . severe pressure against Amalga
mated Copper -was relaxed and that stock ral
lied 1% after reacting to a shade under last
night, but became comparatively steady above
that. The quieter tone of this stock - was Â» a
relief to the whole market and the . violent
bretk is the' raw copper 'market in London
and the heavy selling of Rio Tlntos in Paris
did not seem to affect it. There were various
other points of strength among minor railroad
stocks In the group of coalers and - South
ems and a large demand for Southern Rail
way preferred lifted It at one time 1%. New
York Central was under pressure at different
times on account of the . failure of develop
ments in the rumored Vanderbilt plan at yes
terday's meeting of the directors. There was
more or less speculation based on rumors that
the President's forthcoming message was to
take strong ground for the Federal control or
! restriction of great corporations, including the
' Northern Securities Company. There was sortie
' revived apprehension of further gold exports,
' induced by the further recovery in foreign cx
i change, - the hardening of money rates in Lon
i don and the renewed decline in - sterling ex
| change .it Paris, all of which developments go
to intensify the pressure upon New York for
Bold. The expressed confidence of Berlin finan
ciers, according to cabled- reports, that further
gold was to go from New York to that point,
I was also a disquieting influence.
! The announcement that the United States
Â¦ Steel Corporation syndicate was returning to
Its subscribers the 12H per cent of their sub
scriptions actually paid in, which amounted to
$25,000,000, did not affect that corporation's
stocks, which maintained their recent stability.
The movement of prices of railroad bonds was
irregular. Total sales. $3,290,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the Last call.

Poultry and Game.
The market for dressed Turkeys was In a
curious condition yesterday. Receipts were
very light for the day before Thanksgiving,
being only 60 tons, and ordinarily the market
would have cleaned up at a marked advance,
but the contrary was the case. The market
was firm enough, but the demand was not
sharp, and prico3 remained about as on the pre
ceding day, though aÂ»few extra fine fowl sold
up to 19c. For thin and small stock the call
was light Live Turkeys were firmer. Other
Poultry was generally weak, but prices showed
little change. "No Eastern came in.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There was a sharp drop in Eggs yesterday.
Tbe market has turned completely around dur
ing the past two days. The Dairy Exchange
dropped its quotation to 40c for the best ranch,
and dealers are predicting a further sharp de
cline to-morrow. The outside dealers followed
suit, though more slowly. The Thanksgiving
demand is over, and as receipts are ample and
stocks liberal dealers see no other course than
to reduce prices to sell.
There was no change in Cheese and Butter,
but the latter was still weak, with more on
hand than the market can conveniently take
care of.

STOCK MARKET.
There was a further advance in Alaska Pack
ers' to $160 25 on the morning session of the
Bond Exchange. Street report says that the
advance in this stock is due to a proposed In
crease in the capital stock by which the amount
will be doubled, the dividend then being 50c
per month instead of 75c as at present. There
Is another rumor that thÂ« dividend rate will
be increased to $1 per share on the present
capitalization, the result in either case being
that the dividend will be $48,000 per month In
stead of $36,000 per month as at present. These
reports are not confirmed by the management,
hence are nothing but street gossip at the
moment. Gas and Electric was lower at $43 50
@43 and there were sales of Oceanic at $47.
The other stocks were unchanged. There waÂ»
nothing new in the oil stocks.
In the afternoon Honokaa Sugar wa* lower
at $11 75@1l 50 and Oceanic higher at $47 25Â®
47 00.

Governor Toole on the
Alert to Prevent a
Combine.
Consolidation of Railroad
Lines May Cause
Trouble.
HELENA, Mont.. Nov. 27.â Governor
Toolc last night replied to the invitation
( rnor Van Sant to attend the con
fere!-ce of Governors of the Northwestern !
States to agree to a concerted measure to
prevent the consolidation of railroads un- i
der the joint ownership of the Northern
Securities Company. Governor Toole said |
in part:
"If you have rightly interpreted the
purpose of this organization as it relates
to the State of Minnesota, there would
seem to be no doubt that such a con- j
solidation is a violation of the spirit, If j
â¢ c letter, of Montana's constitution. '
Aside from prohibiting the consolidation '
of parallel or competing lines, our stat- j
utes provide that every person, corpora- i
tion, stock company or association of
persons in this State, who directly or in- j
directly combine or form what is known j
as a trust or tend to treat a monopoly in*
the manufacture, sale or transportation ;
of any articles, is punishable by impris
onment in the State prison for not ex- i
ceeding five years, cr by a fine not ex
ceeding $10,000. or both. Every corpora- !
tion violating the provision of this sec- !
tion forfeits to the State all its property !
and franchises, and in the case of a for- !
eign corporation it is prohibited from j
carrying on businew in the State.
"I am not sufficiently advised at this ]
time to indicate what remedies are avail- !
able to defeat this consolidation and its !
purpose to control the rates of transpor- I
tetion in this State, but whatever lawful :
methods are available will be employed
and to that extent our co-operation may i
be relied on."

CHICAGO, Nov. 27.â Before beinr taken
buck to San Francisco yesterday to stand

- as the murderer.
At the Lime the murder was committed
Lambert was in Shanghai, China, on
board the gunboat Helena, but at first ho
rtiused to give the police any informa
'f his whereabouts at that time.
Finally the circumstantial evidence

I c was in China. The man's state
â¢ s were verified by the Indiana au
;ies and he was hurried back to San
Francisco without having seen his family.

indigestion for about four years, ever

times could eat nothing but the very
lightest food, and then suffer such agony
with my stomach I would wish I never
had to eat anything. I was urged to try
Grape-Nuts Food and since using It I do
uve to starve myself any more, but
eat it at any time and feel nour-

CLAIMS MARSHAL
KEY'S MILLIONS
Descendant of French
Warrior a Citizen
of Hawaii.
Interests Delegate Wilcox in
His Fight for Vast
Estate.
VICTORIA. B. C. Nov. 27,-Emil Ney.
vho claims to be a grandson of Napo
leon's greatest marshal, has enlisted the
aid of Delegate to Congress Robert
W. Wilcox of Honolulu in his
attempt to gain possession of the
fortune of the famous warrior, which
row amounts to about $13,000,000.
Emil Ney is the bailiff of the Grand Jury
of Honolulu district. Marshal Ney, who
had eleven titles of nobility, from Prince
de la Moscow down through dukedoms
to lesser ones, left two sons, one of whom
was Emil Ney's father. This son mar
ried against his mother's will a woman
much below him in rank, though educated
and accomplished.
The son of Marshal Ney died, leaving
three children, of whom Emil Ney, now
a resident of Honolulu, was the eldest.
The latter was born in Prussia. Hi?
mother never told him the complete stpry
of his family, and at 11 years of age he
came to America.
The fortune which he is now seeking
through Delegate Wilcox was that of
Marshal Ney. which, at his execution, was
sequestered by the French Government,
but was ordered restored during the thir
ties. It came into the possession of Mar
shal Ney's other son. known as the Prince
of Moscow, who died a bachelor in Paris
on October 13. 18S2. The fortune was then
held in trust by Count de Lavatary.
Emil Ney, on hearing of the death of
his uncle, began efforts to obtain the for
tune, these attempts being made through
Levi P. Morton, then United States Min
ister to France. They were rewarded
only to the extent of accumulating an im
mense amount of documentary evidence.
Ney, who was then in San Francisco, did
no* at that time have money enough to
effectively prosecute his claim, and when
the Baldwin Hotel burned all these docu
ments were destroyed.

CLERK AGREES
TO STAND TRIAL
Man Accused of Steal -
ing State Papers Is
Arraigned.
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â Carl H. Hoff
mann, who was employed as a stenogra
pher by the Isthmian Canal Commission
at Washington, was arraigned before
United States Commissioner Shields to
day, charged with stealing Government
papers. He agreed to return to Washing
ton to stand trial.
The charge against Hoffmann is that on
November 19 he stole a copy of the final
report of the commission to President
Roosevelt. It was charged that Hoffmann
offered a copy of the canal commission's
report to the French Embassador and
that another copy was offered to a news
paper.
It is understood here that when Secre
tary Hay was informed that a State
paper was being offered in this city he
â¢ed the matter to the United States
DisLrict Attorney's office at AYashirigton.
An investigation was at once begun by
the Washington Police Department and
the arrest followed.
The specific charge against Hoffmann
is that on the 19th day of November he
stole the final report of the canal commis
sion to President Roosevelt. When the
complaint was read Hoffmann did not
answer, but when the Commissioner
asked him if he wished to waive examina
tion he nodded and he consented to go
back to Washington.
It is alleged that when the commission
made reports Hoffmann struck them off
or. the typewriter. It is also alleged that
he struck off more duplilcates than were
needed and would sell them to such news
papers as would buy them. He, it is al
leged in the complaint, had two extra
copies of the final report of the commis
sion. Up to the time he was taken to the
Ludlow-street Jail he made no admission
and had nothing whatever to say.
rORMER GOVERNOR WAITE
IS DEAD IN COLORADO
ASPEN, Colo., Nov. 27.â Former Gover
nor David H. Waite of Colorado fell dead
here to-day at 9 o'clock while peeling
apples. He had been In good health up
to the very moment of his death. It is
believed that the cause of death was
heart trouble.
Davis Hanson Waite was? born at
Jamestown, N. V., April 9, 1825. During
the early part of his life he was engaged
in mercantile pursuits Ut Russell, Pa.,
and Fend dv Lac and Princeton, Wis. He
was a member of the Wisconsin Legisla
ture in 1867. He taught school for a time
and later published a newspaper at
Jamestown, N. Y. In 1876 he removed to
Lamed, Kans., where he was elected to
the Legislature. He came to Colorado in
1879, practicing law at Leadville and
Aspen.
He was a Republican in politics until
1892, when he was a delegate to the Popu
list convention at Omaha. He was nom
inated for Governor of Colorado in that
year by the People's party and was elect
ed. His administration during 1893 and
IK<4 was tempestuous and eventful. Twice
he called out the State militiaâ the first
time to maintain order in Cripple Creek
during the miners' strike and the second
time to seat his appointees on the Den
ver Fire and Police Board, whose author
ity had been disputed by the old board
and who had been forcibly excluded from
the City Hall. Governor Waite was a
candidate for re-election In 1894, but waÂ«
defeated by Charles A. Mclntire, Repub
lican.

Advises Improvement in Navy.
LQNDON. Nov. 27. â Lord Brassey,
speaking at the London Chamber of Com
merce this afternoon on the needs of the
navy, said Great Britain had not received
an adequate return, from a naval point
of view, for the amount spent in ship
subsidies. In spite of the Â£573.000 paid to
four companies since 1887 not one of the
vessels thus available was lit for any
thing except scouting. He urged that
â¢tÂ»-r the Grvernpont insist that all
reserve cruisers be built with the view of
carrying a protective belt when called on
for war service.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1901.
WORK SATISFIES
THE TRAINMEN
Employes at Pittsburg
Decline to Join
Switchmen,
Strikers Express Confidence
in Success of the
Cause.
PJTTSBURG, Pa., Nov. 27.â The Rail
way Trainmen decided officially and
finally at a delegate meeting held in the
Avenue Theater to-day that they would
continue at work, notwithstanding the
strike of the Switchmen's Union of North
America. This means that they will take
out trains made up by non-union men
and that the switchmen, who are mem
bers of the Brotherhood of Railway
Trainmen, will join the strike of their
union.
At a late hour to-night Messrs. Morris
sey and Fitzgerald are in secret confer
ence with Robert Pitcairn, general super
intendent of the Pennsylvania lines. What
the subject of the conference is has not
been learned as yet.
The strikers continue confident of ulti
mately winning the strike, and' say the
action takt*n by the Brotherhood of Train
men will not materially affect their cause.
They say the roads are to all intents and
purposes tied up, and that to-night even
passenger trains are being blocKed. The
company officials say that what delay
there may be in passenger business is
caused by the unusual congested condi
tion of the loads here and elsewhere.
The conditions as found to-day are about
as follows:
The Baltimore and Ohio made little at
t?mpt to move freight locally, although
several trains were made up in the Glcn
wood yards and sent over the "pike."
Four crews worked until noon, when two
were laid , off. The yardmasters says
eight solid trains were made up in' the
yards to-day.
The Allegheny Valley road has experi
enced little if any relief and business in
the yards is practically at a standstill.
Or.ly a few cars filled with perishable
freight were moved. The Crescent mill
at Forty-ninth street is reported partial
ly closed down and the Carnegie, Twen
ty-ninth street and Thirty-third street
mills, it is feared, will have to suspend if
the Allegheny Valley fails to get supplies
to them soon.
The Pittsburg and Western has fared
pretty well to-day. It landed in the
yard at Bennett station fifteen men from
Philadelphia, and three shifts were work
ing. The officials now have hopes of
breaking the strike in a few days. They
have given their old men until to-mor
row to return, and if they fail new men
will be put to work at once.
The Pittsburg Junction road is still tied
up and nothing is being moved.
TWENTY-NINE VICTIMS
ON THE LIST OF DEAD
Lniversity Professor Will Make Ex
amination of Boiler That Caused
Detroit Disaster.
DETROIT, Mich., Nov. 27.â When the
search of the ruins of the Penberthy In
jector Company's plant, wrecked by a
boiler explosion yesterday morning, was
completed to-night the death list had
reached a total of twenty-nine. All but
two of the company's employes have been
located, and as these men worked in the
front building, which was not wrecked,
it is thought that they are at t"heir homes.
The men's addresses are not on the com
pany's books, so it may be some time be
fore they are located. At 6 o'clock to
night the searchers finished the work of
turning the debris. Only two bodies were
found to-day, both of which were terribly
mangled.
The Prosecuting Attorney this afternoon
began an examination into the cause of
the explosion. Professor Mortimer F.
Cooley of the University of Michigan,
who has been asked by Prosecutor Hunt
to make an expert examination of the
wrecked boiler, came in from Ann Arbor
this afternoon and went directly to the
scene of the explosion. He inspected the
exterior of the boiier, but said as yet he
could venture no opinion with regard to
the cause of the explosion.
Professor Cooley will begin his detailed
examination to-morrow. The injured at
the hospitals were reported resting easily
to-night, with the exception of John
Klinowicz, who, it is said, will probably
die before morning.

AMERICAN BOOKMAKEB
JUMPS FROM STEAMEB
Lawrie Marks Commits Suicide and a
Humor of Bank Frauds Is
Abroad.
LONDON, Nov. 27.â Lawrie Marks, well
known in London sporting circles as an
American bookmaker, jumped overboard
from a Channel steamer to-day, and was
drowned. It is said that detectives want
ed to interview Marks in connection with
the Liverpool bank frauds. An injunction
was granted from the High Court this

large sums of money standing in a Lon

Lawrie Marks was a New Yorker. He

ONLY FAIRNESS
China's Minister Talks
to President About
Exclusion.
Diplomat Says His Country
Is Not Seeking Any
Favors.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.â Wu Ting
Fang, the Chinese Minister, called upon
President Roosevelt to-day. In the
course of the interview, which took place
in the Cabinet room, the re-enactment of
the Chinese exclusion act was discussed.
When the Chinese Minister emerged from
the White House he declined to tell a
group of newspaper men whether his
Government was protesting against the
re-enactment of the exclusion law.
"All we want," said he, 'is justice and
fairness."
As he was saying this the Minister was
greeted by Senator Foster, of Washing
ton, who is himself very much interested
in Chinese exclusion.
"Senator," said the Minister, turning to
him, "you are a fair man. Remember
that justice and right have neither color
nor race. W T e do not ask for favors, we
only ask for equality."
In the course of his conversation with
Â¦the newspaper men Mr. Wu suggestefl
that he would be willing to meet any
three of the managing editors who fa
vored exclusion and debate the question
before an impartial tribunal.
ARE MARRIED
AT HIGH NOON
AT ST. LUKE'S
As the church bells rang out the noon
hour yesterday the Right Rev. William
Ford Nichols, Bishop of California, united
Miss Laura Agnes Louisa Simpson to the
Right Rev. Sidney Catlin Partridge, Bish
op of Kyato, Japan. The ceremony was
the most impressive of .its kind ever per
formed in St. Luke's Church. Every seat
in tha sacred edifice was crowded with
friends of the contracting parties and the
vestibule was filled with late comers, who
were unable to find seats.
The altar was prettily decorated. Ever
greens and white roses were entwined
with the altar rails and canopies of
liowers added to the effect. Potted plants
were also used to advantage in the deco-
At high noon the sweet strains of "The
Bridal Chorus" from. "Lohengrin" stole
softly over the church and as the bridal
party emerged from the rector's study in
the rear tne gladsome song filled the
edifice.
The ushers led the way. They were
George Hind, Henry Ohlandt, Frank
Peterson and Harold Smith. Then, came
two little flower girls, Lurline Matson and
\malia Simpson. The children looked
charming in their white satin dresses and
bonnets. After them came the brides
maids, four in number. They were Miss
Gertrude Palmer, Miss Jeanette Deal,
Miss Bessie Wilson and Miss Bertie
Bruce. They were beautifully gowned.
All were attired alike in white chiffon
over pink silk and carried shower
bouquets of Bridesmaid roses.
Next came Miss Maud Simpson, sister
of the bride and maid of honor. She was
escorted by E. Frank Green, the best
man. Miss Simpson looked very pretty to
a gown of Nile green silk over white satin.
She carried a shower bouquet of Amer
ican Beauty roses.
Bishop Partridge followed and on his
arm was the mother of the bride. Lasc
in the procession was the bride, who
leaned on the arm of her father. She
was handsomely gowned and made a
striking picture. Miss Simpson looked
lovely in a robe of white duchess satin,
made with a long court tra,in and covered
with white mousseline de sole. The cor
sage was high, sleeves long and the
gloves were of white undressed kid. In
her coiffure she wore a spray of natural
orange blossoms that held in place the
flowing veil of rare old duchess lace. The
bride met the groom in the chancel and
then the solemn ceremony commenced.
The Rev. Burr M. Weeden, rector of the
church, stood before them as they knelt
at the altar rail and read the betrothal
service. At the close of the reading the
couple stepped within the rail before
Bishop Moreland of Sacramento, who read
the formal words of the marriage service.
When they were pronounced man and wife
Bishop Nichols gave them holy com
munion. It was extremely solemn and
lasted nearly half an hour.
The bridal party then passed out of the
edifice to the stirring strains of Men
delssohn's "Wedding March." The bride
and groom led the procession and were
followed by the flower girls, maid of
honor, parents of the bride, bridesmaids
and ushers.
The bridal party departed in carriages
for the home of the bride's parents at
2520 Vallejo street. The home was beau
tifully decorated with cut flowers, ferns,
smilax and potted- plants. The happy
couple received the congratulations of
their friends beneath a pretty bower of
chains of smilax, pendant from the center
of which was a basket overflowing with
white chrysanthemums. There were 200
guests at the wedding breakfast. Con
gratulatory speeches were made and mu
sic was rendered by a string orchestra.
The couple left last evening for the south,
where they will spend their honeymoon.
They will ieave on December 3 for Japan,

BRICANDS HOPE
FOR MORE COIN
Outlaws Who Detain
Miss Stone Await
New Offers.
Consul General Dickinson
Strives to Raise Needed
Money.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.âNegotia
tions for the liberation of Miss Ellen M.
Stone, the captive missionary, have re
ceived a decided setback as a result of
the refusal of the brigands holding her to
accept a ransom of $65,000.
On the ground that a rich country like
the United States which can offer $65,000
can raise $45,000 more, the brigands have
acquainted the American authorities with
their purpose to hold the woman until
the sum originally demanded, $110,000, has
been paid them. If they persist in this
determination they will hold Miss Stone
indefinitely. The officials are confident
that no harm will befall the woman. She
represents a large sum of money and the
brigands will undoubtedly see that she
suffers no discomfort which would injure
her health.
The refusal of the brigands to accept
less than $110,000 is responsible for the de
parture of Consul General Dickinson from
Sofia for Constantinople. A dispatch re
ceived by the State Department from
Dickinson has led the authorities to the
conclusion that his purpose in going to
the Turkish capital is to consult with the
missionaries with a view to raising more
money. The authorities here do not be
lieve it w;ill be possible to obtain further
contributions by charitable people of the
country. Congress will be in session next
week and the Senators and Representa
tives friendly to missionaries will prob
ably introduce a bill appropriating $45,000
to be used with the sum now available
for Miss Stone's ransom.
SOFIA, Nov. 27.â The Government has
forwarded to C. M. Dickinson, the Unifed
States diplomatic agent here, who re
cently left this city for Constantinople, a
reply to his note of November 12 concern
ing Miss Stone, the American missionary.
It is merely a repetition of the official
views aiready cabled repudiating the ce
sponsibility of Bulgaria and alleging that
the officials had given every assistance
possible in the matter.
IERSHOW'S NURSE TELLS
HOW SHE HEARD OF WILL
Alice Kennedy Says Jules Gamage
Came and Told Her About
Document.
The Kershow will contest case in De
partment 9 of the Superior Court is still
affording a great deal of amusement to
the visitors to the court. Alice Kennedy,
the colored woman who cared for Ker
show during his last illness and who gives
such remarkable answers to the ques
tions asked her by the attorneys, was on
the stand' again yesterday and displayed
the same amount of ignorance of dates
that she did in her examination the day
before. All years, months and days evi
dently look alike to her, for she ..nformed
the court yesterday that she did not know
the' day of the week on which Good Fri
day falls or the time in the month the
Fourth of July is celebrated.
She said yesterday that she was first in
formed by Jules Gamage of the fact that
in the will which is now being disputed
she had been left $1000. He came to her
house the morning the Yale athlete died
and told her that Kershow had left her
that sum. He also told her to go to the
office of Attorney Kowalsky and see about
it. She said thai at that time she in
formed Gamage that she would have
nothing to do with that will. She said
she did not want to get "mixed up with
that crowd." On being asked to explain,
she said that she knew of no other will
made by Max Kershow except the one
in the possession of Attorney Michaels,
and that she also knew that Max Ker
show had made on provision for her In
that document. She admitted, however,
that Kershow had told her that he would
leave her $1000.
MAYOR ASKS RECORDER
GODCHAUX TO EXPLAIN
Civil Service Commission Refers
Charges of Dismissed Copyists to
Him for Investigation.
The Civil Service Commission sent a
communication yesterday to the Mayor,
informing him of the charges made by
Mark Bartlett and Frank Urmy, dis
charged copyists in the Recorder's office,
against Recorder Godchaux, to the effect
that they had been dismissed because
they had refused to contribute to God
chaux's campaign expenses. The com
mission contends that the copyists em
ployed in the office of the RecordeY and
the so-called county offices are subject to
civil service jurisdiction, pending an ap
peal to the Supreme Court. As the com
mission is not empowered to take final
action in cases of official misconduct the
results of future investigations will be
referred to the Mayor.
Mayor Pheian transmitted the Com
missioners' letter to Godchaux, together
with the followirig personal communica
tion:
Will you please make a statement to me, in
writing! concerning the allegations made? and
on Saturday, at 11:30 o'clock a. m., I would
be pleased to see you in my office concerning
the subject matter.
Please return papers herewith transmitted. I
call your attention to section 1, chapter 7, arti
cle IV. and section 8, article XVI. of the char
ter. These provisions, it is alleged, you or your
deputies have violated.

POSTAL SERVICE
COST INCREASES
Report of the Depart
ment Sent to the
President.
Rural Free Delivery System
Is Making Rapid
Strides.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.â Postmaster
General Smith to-day submitted his an
nual report to the President. The report
deals chiefly with statistics. The total rev
nues and expenditures are given as fol
lows :
Ordinary postal revenue, $109,531,778; receipts
from money order business, $1,6Â«8,659; receipts
from unpaid Tioney orders more than one year
old. $430,755; total receipts from all sources,
$U1,831,15Â»3; total expenditures for the year,
i 110 ,554,920. Excess of expenditures over re
ceipts, $3,923,727.
The Secretary say 3 regarding the serv
ice:
While thft expenditures in the ordinary de
velopment and through various extensions of
the service are *7,814,652 greater than for the
preceding year the deficit Is $1,461,961 less. Un
der present prosperous conditions the annual
increase of receipts is fortunately larger than
the inevitable increase of outlay, and for sev
eral years the deficit has been steadily growing
smaller.
The rural free delivery has advanced with
increased strides. Its extension during the
past year has been nearly three times as great
as the whole amount of service previously es
tablished. The number of routes in operation
at the beginning of the fiscal year was 12.6
and at the close 4301. During the current year
the work will proceed still more rapidly. At
the opening of December 6000 routes will be
running and under present plans the number
will increase by July 1, 1902, to 8600.
The rural population now receiving daily ser
vice is about 4.000.000 and at the end of the
fiscal year it will reach 5,700.000. The delivery
system will then cover more than a quarter of
the eligible portion of the country and at tbe
present rate of establishment the entire area
suited to the serviceâ that is, as estimated,
1,000,000 square miles of territory, with 21.000.-
COO rural residentsâ will be brought within its
scope in less than four years.
In conclusion the report says: The fol
lowing recommendations for legislation,
some of which have heretofore been
made, are submitted for the consideration
of Congress:
That the maximum fee for a money order be
fixed at 23 in6tead of 30 cents.
That a fund be created out of the salaries
of railway mail clerks to provide for the re
tirement of such clerks as have, after long
periods of service, become incapacitated for
active duty.
That publishers be required to make a pre
liminary separation of newspapers, under the
direction of the department, as a condition
under which they shall enjoy the exceedingly
liberal rates provided for carrying second-class
matter through the malls.
That the interstate commerce law be amend
ed to prohibit common carriers, to wit, telegraph
and express companies, or any of their em
ployes from aiding and abetting in the green
goods or lottery swindles, or any other scheme
carried on partly by mall and partly by com
mon carrier and which is in violation of the
postal laws.

POPE ORDER
OF THE KAISER
Officers Violate Dueling
Rules and Annoy
William.
BERLIN, Nov. 27.â 1n the Reichstag to
day Herr Bassermann, National Liberal,
interpellated the Government regarding
the recent fatal duel at Insterburg, East
Prussia, in which Lieutenant Blaskowitz
was killed by Lieutenant Hilderbrand.
He asked what the Government was do
ing to prevent duels in the future.
The Minister of War, General yon Goss
ler, in reply said that when Lieutenant
Blaskowitz offered. to apologize the coun
cil of honor ought to have arranged a
compromise. The Emperor had very care
fully investigated the matter and had
reached the conclusion that the object
and spirit of his Cabinet order concern
ing officers' courts of honor had not been
observed. His Majesty had given a strong
and definite expression of his opinion and
had peremptorily commanded that full ef
fect should hereafter be given to this or
der. General yon Gossler added:
"We can only be grateful to the Em
peror for having with his wonted energy
indicated the right course to be pursued.
An official, like any citizen, is subject to
the penal provisions of the law. The
army is not the nursery of duels. In 1897
there were four duels in the army. In 1898
three, in 1599 eight, in 1900 four and in 1901
five duels. This shows that a good tone
predominates among the officers. In civil
ian circles a duel is not regarded with the
seriousness with which it is viewed in
the army. We must publicly recognize
the fact that officers as a rule meet In
sults with dignity and composure."
EMPLOYS CLEVER SCHEME
TO CAPTURE A . THIEF
Mrs. Kirby, who keeps a lodging-house
at the corner of Fourth and Howard
streets, employed a very clever scheme
last night in order to prevent the escape
of a Japanese servant whom she sus
pected of having stolen her gold watch,
together with $45 of her money. She did
not dare to openly accuse the Japanese,
who bears the name of Sam Kamuda of
theft, fearing that he would take flight.
So she waited until he went to his room
and then quietly slipped up and turned
the key in the door.
Knowing that the Japanese could not
escape from his confinement Mrs. Kirby
dispatched a messenger for Police Officer
Cooney. She kept Kamuda confined in
the room until the arrival of the police
man, when the Japanese was placed un
der arrest.

Testimony.
Doctor Believes Ayers Could
Not Have Held the
Weapon.
WASHINGTON". Nov. 27. -The principal
witness to-day before the Criminal Court,
in which Mrs. Lola Bonine is being tried
for the murder of James 3. Ayers Jr..
was Dr. Martin W. Glazebrook, the dep
uty coroner for the District of Columbia,
who conducted the autopsy on the body
of Avers.
The doctor described in detail the threw
wounds on the young man's body, and
the court crier, stripped to the waist, wast
used to illustrate the course of tha
wounds for the instruction of the jury.
Dr. Glazebrook also testified that Mrs.
Bonine had given him her version of thÂ»
manner in which Ayers came to hia
death, claiming that the wounds were- in
flicted while the pistol was in Ayers'
hands, and illustrating how the tragedy
occurred, but he thought that it was im
possible for the wounds to have been
made with the weapon in Ayers' own
hands. She had told him that he was at
her back and had his arms clasped about
her when the shots wer^ fired.
HEGISTRAR'S DEPUTIES
DRAW HIGH 9AT.ARIE3
Auditor Wells Recognizes Ordinance
Creating New Positions for Clerks
Gordan and Zemansky.
Auditor Wells decided yesterday that hÂ«
would audit the demands of Daniel Gor
dan and Harry Zemansky, respectively
chief clerk and Deputy Registrar in the
Registrar's office, whose salaries were in
creased to $150 per month by the Board of
Supervisors. Several months ago the Au
ditor refused to sign the demands becausa
he took the ground that under the char
ter the salaries of deputies in the Reg
istrar's office were limited to $100 per
month.
The City Attorney, however, recently
discovered another section of the charter
which makes it possible for the Supervi
sors, acting on the recommendation of th *
Mayor, to create the two positions and
fix the salaries thereof. The ordinance
on the subject was passed by the votes
of fourteen Supervisors, and the Auditor' 3
favorable action makes it enforceable.
The salaries were raised because Gordan
and Zemansky have a thorough knowl
edge of affairs in the Registrar's office
and act as foremen of men under their
charge.

thority that nine-tenths of cases of deaf-
ness, are caused from catarrh or from sore
throat trouble. ' ... ./ .
The ' little tube which leads to the ear
from the throat is lined with a sort of vel-
vety structure called mucous membrane.
This membrane is simply a continuation
of the -mucous membrane lining of . the
throat. When disease of any sort attacks
the mucous membrane of the throat it is
very liable to extend into the Eustachian
tube and ud into the ear.
The history of nearly all cases of deaf-
ness is like this; a cold is contracted and
neglected, ~ other colds are taken, the
throat becomes sore and inflamed, which*
is aggravated by particles of dust and
germs from the air. This condition cause*
the- disease to spread into the tube that
leads to the ear.
It seems a little far fetched to say that
most cases :of deafness are caused from
catarrh, but it is certainly true, and any
one who has had a severe catarrhal cold
must have noticed how the hearing was
affected while the cold lasted.
With catarrh sufferers this impairment
of hearing becomes chronic and grows"
worse the. longer the catarrh Is neglected :
You can r cure . catarrh and â¢ deafness by
the regular use of an excellent new prepa-
ration ; called Stuart's Catarrh Tablets,
composed of antiseptic remedies, which act
both on the mucous membranes but prin- -
cipally and most effectually on the blood,
eliminating the catarrhal poison Irom the
system. , ._â ..
People whose hearing la defective may
think.it a little remarkable that a simple
and harmless tablet would very often' re-
move all traces of deafness, but when It
is remembered that : catarrh causes the
"deafness and * that the catarrh is easily
cured by the regular use of Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets there is no mystery about It.
If you are subject to nasal catarrh or
catarrh of . throat, bronchial tubes or ca-
tarrh of stomach and liver, the safest and
most effective .treatment Is the new ca-
tarrh specific. â¢ Stuart's Catarrh i Tablet*,
sold by: all druggists at 50 cents for full-
sized package.' .. â¢

WATER COMPANY
MAKES PROTEST
Russell L. Dunn and William C. Al
berger, who made an offer to the Board of
Supervisors to sell the Giant Gap water
supply to the city, appeared before the
public utilities committee yesterday and
through their attorney, Frank H. Gould,
raised the point that City Engineer Gruns
ky had failed to include the supply named
in his investigations and report on avail
able water supplies. Gould argued that
the charter specifically provides that all
the supplies must be estimated upon and
that the City Engineer's omission inval
idated the preliminary proceedings in the
matter.
Gould said he was prepared to show that
the Giant Gap supply is a cheaper propo
sition than the Tuolumne River project
which had been recommended by the City
Engineer for acquisition by the city.
"The Giant Gap Company," said Gould,
"will sell its water rights on the north
fork of "the American River in Placer
County for the sum of $2,000,000, or will
construct the water works to deliver 45,
00,000 gallons daily and transmit 13,000
24 horsepower for $17,350,000."
Chairman Reed held that the Giant Gap
Company did not have a "nevar-failing
supply," which objection obtained against
the Spring Valley Company.
City Engineer Grunsky contended that
the cheaper construction of the Giant Gap
Company was owing to estimates on pipe
that would not stand the pressure. Gruns
ky stated that his estimates on the Tu
olumne River supply contemplated a prac
tically indestructible system.
In answer to a question asked by Mayor
Phelan as to the adequacy of the Giant
Gap Bystem Dunn said that the water
sheds aggregated 2E square miles, the
supply was more accessible and the reser
voir capacity was enormous.
Commissioner Manson said that the Tu
olumne River supply was a superior sup
ply as to abundance and freedom of con
tamination.
The committee made no recommendation
and the protest will be taken to the board.
The committee reported adversely to the
bill to include the repavlng of accepted
streets at a cost of $1,000,00 in the bond
issue.

The jury was out all night and took
twenty bailots, in the first of which there
were eight votes for conviction and four
for acquittal. A decision was reached at
'Â£ a. m.
In passing sentence Judge Herrick
spoke of tne fact tnat conviction meant
to tne captain tnat alter seventeen years
as an unusually vignant and intelligent
oificer he must now begin .us career in
life anew. i<'or the benerit or police ofll
cers and for the public as well the Judge
maintained a seeming distinction between
the punishment of _;i3sert, Captain Dia
monu's wardman, who was recenUy con
victed of accepting "protection money"
from keepers of aisorderly houses and
sentenced to five years and six months in
State prison, and the comparatively mild
sentence imposed on the captain, that
while it haa been supposed tne latter re
ceived a portion of tne money collected
by the, wardman, no evidence in support
or tnat supposition had been adduced.
The Judge also spoKe of the fact that
disorderly houses "by a large portion of
our community are regarded as necessary
evils in large cities, and police officials
wink at their continuance and allow them
to violate the law as long as they do not
flaunt their violations of the law before
the public." Without expressing an opin
ion as to whether the tolerance of this
class of houses is morally right or wrong,
the court said: "It is something that is
done probably by every police official in
every large city in the State, and there is
not a police captain probably in any pre
cinct in the city of New York or in the
city of Albany, for that matter, that
might not be convicted for exactly the
same crime that you have been convict
ed of."
The fine was paid under protest and
Captain Diamond will appeal from the
judgment against him.
NEW YOKK, Nov. 27.â There is uncer
tainty as to whether Captain Diamond
loses his place in the police department
by reason of his conviction. Commission
er Murphy said to-day that he would not
take any action until he had received a
transcript of the case and had consulted
private counsel. He said that Bissert had
been convicted of a felony, while Captain
Diamond had been convicted of a misde
meanor.
Highbinders Caught in Time.
Armed with a huge knife, which, he had
concealed in his sleeve. Chin Wun, an I
Americanized Chinaman, started out last I
evening to avenge the death of Chin
Chow, who was murdered a short time
ago in a gambling house kept fey the no
torious Bock Oye. Accompanied by an- i
other Chinaman, who is known as a dcs- i
perate fellow, Chin Wun lay in wait in St.
) Louis alley, prepared to murder the first
j Wong man who appeared. His actions
| attracted the attention of Police Officer
Robl, who placed him and his companion
under arrest. At the City Prison Chin
> Wun was charged with carrying a con
cealed weapon and his companion with va
! grancy.
It was supposed that the trouble be
tween the Wong and Chin families Sad
been amicably settled, but by the arrest
of Chin Wun the police are satisfied that
the war is on again.
Yuen Mow was booked yesterday on two
charges of assault to murder. Yuen Ling,
whom he attacked with a cleaver at 911
Clay street Tuesday morning, is now out

SEAWELL HOLDS
AGAINST DUPRAT
Says Pish Commissioners
Have Right to Seize
QuaiL
Pronounces Game Preserva
tion Statutes Consti
tutional.
The two suits of L. Duprat against the
Board of Fish Commissioners were de
cided by Judge Seawell yesterday. The
court sustained the demurrers to both
suits interposed by the board.
About a month ago Duprat, who is a
dealer in game in the California Market,
commenced two suits in the Superior
Court against the Board of Fish Commis
sioners and certain deputies. One of the
cases was a suit at law on behalf of Du
prat for $506 damages for the seizure of
twenty- five quail; the other suit was in
equity, alleging that the seizure by the
deputies of the commission of quail and
ducks in transit was unlawful and that
the law for the protection of game was
unconstitutional. Judge Seawell at that
time issued aD order that the commission
and its deputies show cause why an in
junction should not issue to restrain the
deputies of the commission from seizing
such quail and ducks without a search
warrant.
On behalf of the commission and its
deputies demurrers and affidavits were*
filed, claiming that the court had no juris
diction to interfere in the subject matter
of the actions, because the game was
seized by the deputies as public officers
in the execution of the State laws for the
preservation of game, and that the game
seized was being shipped for the purpose
of sale, contrary to law.
Laat Friday the matters were argued
before Judge Seawell and this morning
he rendered his decisions in the cases. In
the suit for damages against the commis
sion and its deputies he sustained the de
murrers upon the ground that the court
had no jurisdiction of the subject matter
of the action. In the equity suit for an
injunction he sustained the demurrers up
on the grounds that the laws for the
preservation of game are constitutional,
and therefore that an injunction could not
issue to restrain the deputies of the com
mission from the execution of such laws
for the preservation of game. He also
discharged the order for an injunction;
and thus it has been determined by this
decision that the commission and its dep
uties cannot be prevented from seizing
without a search warrant game which is
being 1 shipped for the purpose of evading
the laws of the State.

CHEATS WOMAN
OUT OF MONEY
D. Appeibum Wanted to
Answer a Charge of
Felony.
Miss Henrietta Jones, 404 Golden Gate
avenue, secured a warrant in Judge Ca
baniss' court yesterday for the arrest of
David Appeibum en a charge of obtain
ing money by false pretenses. The
amount set forth in the complaint is $420,
but Miss Jones says that Appeibum re
ceived $1570 from her.
'I have known Appeibum, who is about
26 years of age, for about three years,",
said Miss Jones when interrogated by
Captain Seymour. "During that time he
roomed in a. lodging-house kept by myself
and sister at Z'2S> i-iearny street. I sold
my interest ir. the house to my sister on
July 5 last. Appelbum began to borrow
money from me in April last on the repre
sentation that he had a third interest In
a ladies' tailoring establishment at 111
Sansome street.
"I had such implicit faith in Appeibum
that I continued advancing him money
on that representation till the amount ag
gregated M 570. When I sold cut to my
sister in July Appeibum left the house
and told me he was going to live at a
downtown hotel. A few days ago I
learned that he had left the city, and on

Interview With Edward Short of
the San Francisco Call.
Mr. Edward Short, connected with the
business department of the San Francisco
Call, interviewed:
Q.â You are reported to have been cured
of diabetes?
A.â That is right.
Q.â Are you sure it was diabetes?
A.â l was rejected for insurance, and
later failing rapidly, our physician told
me I had diabetes and to put my affairs
in shape.
Qâ Have more than one physician?
A.â Tee, I had another confirm it. He, i
too, said I could not live long. I had j
dropped from 200 to 135 pounds and was !
very weak. A neighbor told me of the
Fulton Compound.
Q â How long did you have to take it?
A.â About a year before I was perfectly
well.
Q.â Did your physicians then test for
sugar?
A.â Both did. Both reported normal.
They were very greatly surprised at my
recovery, for they had told me diabetes
was incurable.
Q â Know of any other cures?
A.â Several. I told my friend, William
Martin, an B. P. conductor of Stockton,
about it. He had diabetes and was about
to give up his position when I told him '
He got the same results I did and was
well when killed a year or so later.
Q. â Any others?
A.â l told William Hawkins of the Cus-
tom-house and Captain Hubbard of the
barkentine S. N. CaFtle upon hearing they
had diabetes. Both of them were cured
I aleo told a reighbor who had dropsy.
In a month it was eliminated. I* can't
recollect all I've told.
Q.â Did it fail in any case?
A.â Not one. It is a positive cure in
Bright's disease and diabetes. Go over
and see Hawkins and he will tell you the
same thine.

tive but scrupulously honest and consci-
entious, as inquirers will learn at The
Call office.)

PROSECUTION CLOSES ITS CASE
AGAINST EX-POLICEMAN WILSON
Former Playmates of Maggie Hartwell, Who Was Murdered on
Fourth of July Night, Give Testimony Tending to Fasten the
Crime Upon the Accused â Defense Will Open To-Morrow
SEVERAL witnesses were called
yesterday in the Wilson murder
trial before Judge Dunne, but the
facts they testified to were few
and in the most part cumulative.
During the morning session two young
girls, playmates of murdered Maggie
Hartwell, took the stand and despite
their youthfulness told steady stories of
the fatal Fourth of July night on Shipley
street.
Ed Gegiien was the first witness of the
day. He was standing near the railing
of the fence In front of his house on Ship
ley street and saw the children playing
in the street. According to his testimony,
a flash of fire seemed to come from the
right hand of Wilson and Maggie Hart
well immediately dropped to the ground.
Lfljr Hollman saw the flash of the pistol

and heard the report. "It sounded like
the report of a pistol," she said, "and
not like any kind of a firecracker." She
also testified that Wilson had come down
from the porch of his house an hour be
fore Maggie Hartwell was shot. "Just
before the shooting I saw Mr. Wilson
leaning on the post with his right hand
flat on the top of it," said the witness.
Laura Chessman Testifies.
But of all the youthful witnesses Laura
Chessman was the most positive in
her answers. With fluffy flaxen hair
on both sides of her face and dressed in
her Sunday best, Laura went at testi
mony giving as if it were an every-day ,
habit with her. The cross-examination â¢
did not worry her in the least. During
the day she had seen Wilson on several
occasions. Once he was coming down the
street from the grocery with a can
that looked like the condensed milk va
riety in his left hand. His right hand
was in the pocket of his short cardigan
jacket which was pulled downward in
the front and upward in the back, so that
it disclosed what seemed to the young
girl the butt of a pistol in Wilson's hip
pocket. On cross-examination the wit
ness was sure that it was a pistol
"My brother dropped a firecracker out |
of his pocket," said the witness in course |
of her examination, "and just as he i
stooped to pick it up I heard a ringing

ground. Previous to this I saw Mr. Wil
son come down from the porch to the
street and place his right hand flat on the
post."
T. I. Fitznatrick, who is in the Dis
trict Attorneyls office, testified as to a
conversation with â¢ the murdered girl in
the Receiving Hospital on the night of
the Fourth. He said:
I first asked her where she lived. In regard
to the shooting 1 asked ncr who fired the shot,
and she said: "Mr. Wilson." I asked her If
she could Identify him. She then looked at
"Wilson and said: "Yes, the man with the
white hat." Wilson did not say anything, at
this time.

Mrs. Anna Chessman, the mother of
Laura, pave testimony as to Wilson's
possession of a pistol. She says that he
was on the porch brandishing a pistol
and revolving the cylinder some time in
the neighborhood of 6:30 o'clock, and that
Miss Johnson was with him.
Willie O'Neill came on the stand after
Mrs. Chessman. He saw both Mrs. Chess
man at her window and Wilson on his
porch. Wilson flourished a pistol and
aimed it down the street somewhere in
W r illie's direction. "I screwed behind
O'Brien's fence as fast as I could," said
Willie. This was before Willies supper

Insane People Sued.
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford filed
two suits yesterday against inmates of
the asylums for the insane at Stockton
and at Napa. He seeks to recover $840
each from Emanuello Dosso, confined at
Napa, and Caspar Staehle, confined at
Stockton. He claims they owe the State
this money for care and maintenance.

hour. Willie came back to play later on
in the evening. When he saw Wilson on
the porch he said he was alone.
The case for the prosecution closed with
testimony from the officers of the law.
Policemen Eskew and Beaman and De
tective Wren went upon the stand in suc
cession and made statements of facts
concerning the arrest and their actions in
searching the house. Wilson, when asked
by Eskew if he had a pistol, replied in
the negative.
Returning to the Wilson house Eskew
made a search for a pistol, being directed
to the basement by Mrs. Wilson, who
said that her husband formerly owned a
pistol and that she thought it was in the
basement. The pistol, a 38-caliber Colt's,
was found in a box containing scrap iron
on the left hand side of the door in the
basement. Three of the chambers were
loaded, one was empty and the other
two had empty cartridges which bore evi
dence of having been recently used. At
the Receiving Hospital Wren and Eskew
asked the defendant if the pistol was his.
He said it was, according to Eskew's tes
timony. They then asked him about the
cartridges, and Wilson admitted that he
fired cne shot at the fence at the end of
the street about 7:30 o'clock, but had no
recollection of the other.
The prosecution has finished its case.
On Friday morning at 10 o'clock the de
fense will be begun.

SCHOOL BOARD
RESCINDS RULE
Priority of Service No
Longer Observed in
Appointments.
Teacher Zimmerman to Stand
' Trial on Charge of
Incompetency.
The Board of Education made another
and final attack on the chronological
order in the appointment of teachers yes
terday by repealing a resolution adopted
September 26, 1900, requiring assignments
from the day substitute and evening
eligible lists to be made chronologically.
All orders and resolutions requiring as
signments of teachers to vacancies to be
made In such order were also repealed.
This will enable the board to select in
discriminately from their eligible lists in
making assignments to regular positions
and puts the "priority service rule" under
the ban.
The board adopted a resolution fixing
Monday, December 2, as the date for the
trial of William Zimmerman, on charges
preferred by Principal Bush of the Poly
technic School. This action was taken
at Zimmerman's request.
The pupils of. the Polytechnic High
School sent a communication, expressing
regret that their conduct had prompted
Principal Bush to prefer charges of in
competency against Zimmerman. The
pupils petition the board to overlook the
complaint and promise to maintain the
strictest order In the future and help to
elevate the standard of the German
class.
Peter T. Riley was assigned to the
Humboldt Evening School, vice A. J.
Dannenbaum, on leave.
Miss Belle Croyland, now substituting
in the Girls' High School, was elected a
regular teacher in the Girls' High School,
subject to the two years' probation.
Leaves of absence were granted to
Miss Helen- D. Conlon, Miss Margaret
Lahaney, Miss E. Macdonald and A. J.
Dannenbaum.
Miss McKinney gave notice that she
would accept her assignment to the
eligible list, only under protest and peti
tions that she be reinstated as teacher in
the John Swett School.
Superintendent Webster gave notice of
an amendment to rule 85, to read as fol
lows:
Teachers desiring to be absent from duty
must give notice thereof to the board, stating
the cause and duration of such absence. Such
notification, made upon official blanks, and ap
proved by the principal, must be sent to th*
seeretÂ£.r> for consideration by the board. In
cases of sickness, or other emergency, teachers
may absent themselves temporarily without
permission for a term not to exceed one day;
but such teachers must, upon returning to duty,
give notice thereof in the manner above pro
vided. Teachers absent from duty without such
notice and approval must be reported at once
by the principal to the secretary, who shall
report the same tv the board.
ANARCHISTS MAY
BE DRIVEN OUT
Immigration Laws to Be
Changed So as to
Exclude Them.
United States Immigration Commission
er Hart H. North has returned from
Washington and brings with him an in
teresting story of his experiences. In
company with the Immigration Commis
sioners at Boston, New York. Philadel
phia and Baltimore, Commissioner Gen
eral T. V. Powderly and the United States
Industrial Commission he attended a
meeting held in Washington to consider
the immigration laws, the best means of
rendering them more effective and to sug
gest such changes as seemed to be de
manded, by experience. They held an
other meeting a week later and framed
an act to take the place of Â¦ the present
laws, covering the same points and patch
ing up loopholes that had been found to
exist.
The new act to be submitted to Con
gress by the department will prohibit the
immigration of anarchists or that class
of revolutionists who are opposed to all
gcvernments, and will require the depor
tation of all anarchistic aliens found in
this country.
North made some inquiry into the pro
posed Chinese exclusion legislation and
found that the Geary act, with some
changes and modifications, was most fa
vored. It will be introduced into Con
gress as a department bill by Senator
Perkins, and the recommendation will be
made by the Industrial Commission when
it makes its report that the restriction
act be passed.
The members of the convention called
on President Roosevelt, and he expressed
himself in hearty accord with their work.
He informed North that he had just re
ceived a letter from Governor Gage, in
viting the President to visit California,
President Roosevelt sent back a reply
stating that if nothing unforeseen occur
red to prevent he would come to Califor
nia next summer.
The labor question will be taken up by
the Industrial convention at an early date.
Accused of Forging Checks.
E. C. Kalben, ex-Supervisor, swore to
a complaint in Judge Mogan's court yes
terday for the arrest of D. B. Walker, ex
secretary of the Imperial Oil Company, on
a charge of forgery. He is accused of forg
ing Kalben' s name to a check for $10,
which he passed on E. C. Fraser. Kalben
is the president of the company and al
leges that Walker has been cashing a
number of similar checks. Detective
Whitaker has been detailed to find
Walker.
Death of Thomas Hoey.
Thomas Hoey of 2440 California street
died at the Central Emergency Hospital
yesterday afternoon of injuries received
last Monday afternoon by falling into an
apoplectic fit at the intersection of Cali
fornia and Fillmore streets. Hoey was a
widower, about 70 years old, and had been
employed as a bartender by William
Plath.

RALSTON FAILS TO GET
GLAD HAND FROM MINERS
All the members of the California Con
gressional delegation will probably be in
Washington next Monday. Senator Per
! kins left Oakland night before last for
I the national capital and Senator Bard
left Hueneme day before yesterday. Rep
resentative S. D. Woods started for the
East yesterday. Representatives Loud,
Metcalf, Coombs, Kahn, Needham and
McLachlan may be in Washington before
the Senators arrive. A conference of the
delegation on the subject of Chinese ex
clusion will probably take place next
week.
The death of J. M. Gleaves causes a va
cancy in the important position of United
States Surveyor General for the District
of California and before the middle of
next week Senators Bard and Perkins will
have received by wire many applications
for the offiqe. The Senators, in accord
ance with a rule adopted last summer,
may insist on naming Gleaves' successor
without asking the advice or suggestion
of the other members of the delegation. It
is said that Perkins desires to waive the
rule in the case of John C. Lynch' s suc
cessor in order to keep himself poised on
the fence. He wants Lynch ousted, but
at the same time he wants the little as
sistance that Herrin and Lynch may be
able to give to a candidate for the L rated
States Senate at the next session of the
Legislature.
Herrin has so much work cut out for
him on the oil schedule before the Rail
road Commission that he cannot get an
opportunity to do much to help Lynch or
find time to inspect the Gage fences.
Ralston as Fence Inspector.
Ex-Assemblyman W. C. Ralston was
some time ago appointed repairer of the
Governor's fences in the mining counties,
but the reception which he received dur
ing a recent tour of inspection in Amador,
Calaveras and Nevada counties was any
thing but encouraging. Ralston had a
notion that he could make a clever turn
for himself while taking care of Gage's
interests. His own desire is to represent
in the State Senate the mountain district
which Is now ably represented by John
F Davis, and which for many years prior
to Senator Davis' incumbency was so
creditably represented by E. C. Voorheia.
On his recent trip Ralston found that
Senator Davis was invincible. He found
also that his own chances of going back
to the Legislature as the representative
of an Assembly district were slender.
Ralston at the last session lo3t the con
fidence of the miners by his efforts to ob
struct important legislation recommend
ed by the California Miners' Association.
He lost prestige also by his betrayal of
Alden Anderson, candidate for Speaker of
the Assembly. His constituents took notÂ«
of his peculiarities as an Assemblyman
and observed that he really accepted the
orders of the Gage-Herrin machine. He
saw enough on his recent trip to convince
him that his aspirations for the State
Senate might as well be put aside. He
will play politics in great luck if he suc
ceeds in getting back to the Assembly.
Gage, perceiving that San Francisco and
Los Angeles are likely to send anti-ma
chine delegates to the next Republican
State Convention of 1902, is making stren
uous efforts to rally the mining counties
Ito his support. In sending out Ralston to
round up the miners the Governor dis
plays more energy than judgment.
Herrin Is Not in Good Form.
Herrin at this time is not in form to
help any of his political chums. In fact,
he is making plaintive appeals on his own
account for assistance. He realizes that
the loss of the oil case before the Rail
road Commission, following the municipal
i election reverses, and coming on the heels
! of his slated retirement from the Market
street Railway, would accomplish his un
doing as a political manipulator for the
Southern Pacific
There is something doing In the boss
camp. Martin Kelly and his henchmen
had a function or housewarming Tuesday
night In the new and elaborate head
quarters of the burly boss In the Yen
dome, at the Intersection of Mason, Turk
and. Market streets. The activity of the
bosses at this early stage of the guberna
torial campaign should suggest to good
citizens the necessity for anti-boss organ
ization.
