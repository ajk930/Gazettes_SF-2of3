Charles -E. Hughes of counsel for .the

town residence in Brooklyn Mr. Searles
also has or had a fine summer home at
Buzzards Bay, near the properties of ex-
Presldent Cleveland and Joseph Jefferson.
As treasurer of the sugar company and
president of the Western National Bank
Mr. Searles gained a reputation for busi
ness sagacity and because of his reputa
tion was asked to enter the directories of
various corporations. His friends say that
he seemed to have unlimited faith In tlw
possibilities of the American Cotton Com
pany. One of the banks with, which' Mr.
Searles had an account Is the Merchants"
National of Way street. An official of one
of the leading banks downtown stated to
day that Mr.'Seartes had been in a bad
way for ready money since last fall.
Edward F. Dwlght, assignee of Mr.
, Searles, said to-night:
Wellington replied that he was delighted
to know the Senator (Platt) was not. In
the conspiracy to secure the Enactment of
the bill. He declared that while he was
arguing against It, In accorda?:ce.wlth his
right as a Senator, he Â« was threatened
that unless he .ceased his opposition f>
cloture rule would be presented and its
adoption insisted upon. \ -
"I: desire to pay," said he, "that I bow
to no party and to no man when my con
science tells mo that a measure Is -wrong."
He was proceeding to say that the prop
osition was "peculiar" when he was;in
terrupted by Mason of Illinois with the
comment, "It is peculiar because this" 1-:
a~ peculiar. body. 'Â¦'.Â¦.â¢ (Laughter.) Â¦ ..â¢â¢.Â¦â¢,â¢." Â¦
After Mr. Morgan had offered a resolu
tion declaring the Clayton-Bulwer; treaty
between the United States and Great Bri
tain .abrogated, the -Senate .went 'Into
executive session, and at lU5 r o'clock ad
journed. . â¢ â¢ Â¦ .' -â¢ .-'
Wellington challenged the propriety of
the presentation of such a proposition as
that of Platt at the extraordinary session
of the Senate and declared hi3 : purpose
later to raise against It a point of order.
Speaking of the defeat of tho river and
harbor bill, to. which he sairl he had con
tributed, he declared: ."This proposed rule
is offered as a means of revenge."-.
Platt, interrupting him, said: "I will
say to the Senator that I was not in favor
of the passing of the river and harbor
measure." Â¦ . ' \
Styled a Revenge Measure.
Just expired, he declared that the major
ity was. helpless. to prevent the defeat of
the measure.
The amendment he would propose, he
said, was a modification of the Reed rules
of the House of Representatives. He said
his amendment w<?uld enable the opposi
tion to have ample time for its discussion,
but limited the time of debate to. proper
length. Â¦Â¦â¢-:Â¦. â¢<â¢**.:--
Baconof Georgia disapproved, of -the
proposed change in the rules and declared
his purposo to do everything in his power
to defeat the amendment. He .warned the
Senate that if the proposed rule wer?
adopted it soon would go the whole length
and the spectacle would be presented of a
Congressâ not only the House, but vthe
Senate alsoâ dominated by one or two
men. }/,* ;-\
Rule of the Minority.
What is a "reasonable time," he de
clared, . was a â¢ question , that would
be discussed for twelve months in the
Senate, which he said is the only legisla
tive body in the world in which- the ma
jority is controlled by the minority. Re
.ferrlng to the defeat of the river and har
bor bill in the closing hours of the session
Mason of Illinois, who, since his advent
in the Senate four years ago, -has been
Insistent that the rules be changed so as
to enable t the majority .to transact the
business of the Senate,' gave notice of an
amendment he proposed* to /the ; amend
ment of Platt. He incited that the time
should be fixed in the rules for the limit
ing of debate.
Cockrell suggested. In a spirit of face
tiousness, that the reasons for the adop
tion of the proposed rule had ceased to
exist in the Senate and, therefore, it was
not necessary now to adop ( t it.
"They will arise again," remarked Platt.
WASHINGTON, May 5.â Quite unex
pectedly a lively debate was precipitated
to-day at the first business session of the
Senate of the Fifty-seventh Congress ;
Promptly at noon Vice" President Roose- :
velt stepped briskly to his desk. At the;
conclusion of the reading of the Journal
McLaurln of Mississippi and Nelson of
Minnesota were. sworn in. Platt of Con

ment to the Senate rules which he pro
posed to offer to-morrow. - The proposition
is one to limit debate upon any bill or

that the majority of the body may be abler

THE RUMOR
IN MEXICO
Referring to the criticism of himself
published In the Russian Commercial and
Industrial Gazette because he had not re
garded German agriculture as a negligible
quantity, the Chancellor said it was the
right and duty of every government to
give all the concessions It could without
prejudicing the Interests of its country.
But appreciation of Â¦ these Interests did
not imply hostility against "our hereto
fore, and I hope, our future commercial
friends. I hope we shall come to an un
derstanding in this respect. But here
again the basis can only be complete re
ciprocity and the independence of our own
country.".
The Chancellor proceeded to remark
'thatiif he directed his course In accord
ance with foreign criticism it would not
Imply friendship, but vassalage.
"Regarding the decorating of Lord Rob
erts with the Order of the Black Eagle
that was solely a matter for the King of
Prussia to decide. It Is a question of the
constitutional, personal prerogative of the
crown. ) Lord Roberts is not a political
personage. Therefore the distinction con
ferred is one of no political importance.
"Regarding Russia I am fully convinced
that one of the foremost endeavors of our
policy is to cultivate the most friendly
and most neighborly relations. I am firm
ly convinced that German-Russian in
terests go side by side In most matters
and there Is no point where with mutual
good will prevailing our interests â¢ need
cross. There is no antagonistic sea part
ing the two empires 'which cannot be
bridged. But here also we require equal
ity. Germany Is no more dependent on
foreign countries than they are dependent
on us."
Of No Political Importance.
"I observed two months ago," said the
Chancellor, "and I repeat to-day, that
nothing is changed In our relations with
Great Britain since I declared In the
Reichstag that we were ready and willing
to live -in peace, friendship and unity
with Great Britain on the basis of mutual
consideration and absolute equality. If.
therefore, the Emperor by his presence
and demeanor In England opened the way
for a continuance of such normal good
relations It Is advantageous to the two
countries. No doubt there are many
bore points between the two countries, but
at the same time there are numerous and
necessary points of contact
them. Good, neighborly relations are re
quired In both countries,* and there Is no
political reason why we should not culti
vate relations with Great Britain in as
careful a way as the other powers do.
The accession of the new sovereign will
not change the relations of Germany and
Great Britain. Perhaps there have been
people who hoped that the change would
exercise an unfavorable Influence, but
these expectations have not been realized,
which also is advantageous to the two
powers and to general peace.
"Herr Schaedler said the Emperor's
visit violated our neutrality toward the
South African war. and I have also seen
parallels drawn of the Emperor's visit to
England and the non-reception of Presi
dent Kruger In Berlin. The parallels are
not correct. The avowed object of Presi
dent Kruger's projected journey to Berlin
was to compel us. in an unusual manner,
to interfere in the South African com
plications, whereas his Majesty's visit to
England has nothing to do with the South
African war. I deny In the most em
phatic manner that the Emperor acted In
any way contrary to the Interests of the
country In accepting and responding to
attentions.
Relations Not Changed.
The statement of the Chancellor was
made during the debate on the foreign
estimates. Herr Schaedler, In putting his
question, asserted that dissatisfaction was
rife in Germany and that the country de
sired Information regarding the political
significance of the. Emperor's visit to
Kngland and the effect of the accession
cf the new sovereign. King Edward. The
decoration of Lord Roberts with the Or
der of the Black Eagle, he further as
serted, caused wide dissent. The Ger
mans were afraid that a hyper-friendly
policy toward Great Britain would create
enemies for Germany on the Continent.
The speaker wanted to know, therefore,
how Germany stood In relation to the
other powers, especially the power3 of
the Dreibund. The tie with Russia must
not be touched.
The Chancellor laid emphasis on the
noblo impulse actuating the Emperor and
the desire of the German Government
that It might be vouchsafed to Germany
and Great Britain to work In peace and
for peace.
BERLIN, March 5.â Replying to a ques
tion of Herr Schaedler (Centrist) In the
Reichstag to-day on the subject of Em
peror William's recent visit to England,
the Imperial Chancellor, Count von Bu
low, declared the visit was neither of a
political nor of a courtly character, but
was purely of a humane character. The
Emperor merely hastened to the deathbed
Of his grandmother. It Is easy to under
stand that the act evoked the gratitude of
Great Britain and aroused there a. desire
for peaceful and friendly relations. This
wish was shared by Germany, a full
equality of rights between the German
and British nations being, of course, a
condition sine qua non.

According to Dr. Harlanson the safest

Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux, Golden Seal
and fruit acids. Those tablets can now
be' found at all drug stores under the
name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, and
not belntr a patent medicine, can be used
with perfect safety and assurance that
healthy appetite and thorough digestion
will follow their regular use after meals.
Mr. N. J. Booher. Chicago, 111., writes:
"Catarrh Is a local condition resulting
from a neglected cold in the head, where-
by the lining membrane of the nose be-
comes inflamed and the poisonous dis-
charge therefrom passing 1 backward into
the throat reaches the stomach, thus pro-
ducing catarrh of the stomach. Medical
authorities prescribed for me for three

cure, but to-day I am the happiest of men
after using: inly one box of. Stuart's
Dyspepsia tablets. I cannot find appro-

Upon motion of Johnson this morning
an amendment providing an entirely dif
ferent text of party affiliation from the ,
one embodied In the committee bill waa <
adopted.' The test agreed upon by the
committee was as follows:
The voter thereby declares as a test of his
right to vote a bona fide present Intention of
supporting the nominees of such political party*
or organization at the next ensuing election;
and any voter may be challensed and his right
to vote may be withheld unless he will make
oath or affirmation as to the bona fide present
Intention to support the nominees of tbe con
vention to which delegates are to be so elected
for such political party or organization. He
may likewise be challenged for any cause that
would disqualify a voter at a general election.
If not challenged, or if the challenge, be over
ruled or withdrawn, he shall receive from the
ballot clerk a ballot having tbe designation
and heading of the political party whose name
was written on such roster, by or for him.
and ho may bo permitted to prepare and vote
the same.
Johnson's amendment strikes out- all' of
this test to the clause providing for chal
lenge for any cause that would disqualify
a voter at a general election. The test
the amendment provides is as follows: .
The ballot clerk shall then ask him this
question and none other: "Do you Indorse the
principles of the party which you have named,
according to tha most recent declaration of
Its principles by the highest authority In that
party?" Upon an affirmative answer being
given to the question by htm. and not other
wise, he shall be furnished one of the offi
cial ballots containing the name of the party
so named by him, and permitted to vote there
on; and be shall not be permitted to vote any
other party ballot at that election.
The amendment leaves out the "oath or
affirmation" clause and makes Indorse
ment of party principles the test Instead
of the â¢ assertion of a "bona fide present
Intention" to 6upport the nominees of the
party. '
Amendment Is Argued. -
Macbeth, Sheridan and Carter defended
the committee test. Laird supported the
Johnson amendment.' He declared that the
committee test would keep away from the
rived in San Francisco In January. They
had trailed the offender and the woman
across the continent, but could not locate
them. As soon as Conlin came to the
coast he took the name of O'Rell and for
a time remained under cover. He became
interested In the prizefighting business,
and the job he had was training "ICid"
McFadden. the pugilist, in Alameda. On
February 12 the Inspectors and Detective
Torn Ryan of the local department re
ceived the Information that the much
wanted thief was In this city, and since
that time they have worked hard to land
him behind prison bars. They trailed him
by means of the woman, and recently as
certained his connection with McFadden.
The detectives went to Alameda. where
the training quarters are located, but
failed to find him. Last night they caught
him in a lodging-house at 431 Fourth
street and took him to the City Prison,
where his name was placed on the detinue
book. . â¢
* Conlin claims that he has two wealthy
uncles in California and that he has been
a black, sheep In a highly respected East
ern family. Ife has a" youthful appear
ance, but bears all the earmarks of dissi
pation. His manner Is pert, and he re
fused to say much about his case. To the
detectives, however, -he admitted his guilt
and told the entire story of the theft. He
paid that he had not realized more than
{300 on the stolen mall matter, but refused
to say where the remainder of his plunder
ceuld be found. He had an accomplice,
and on this point he is also silent: but he
Intimated that his "pal" In crime was not
on the coast.
Mrs. Conlin, the thief's deserted wife. Is
at the present time trying to secure a
divorce. The officers will return to New
York with their prisoner as soon as the
necessary requisition papers can be se
cured.

Bomance Beginning in Italy Ends in
Attempted Murder in the
the Klondike.
SEATTLE. March 5.â An Interesting
story of love, revenge and attempted mur-
der.is told in a recent issue of the Dally
Alaskan. Sunny Italy was the birthplace
of the romance, which ended with pas
sion in bleak Alaska.
Plo Crossettc, an Italian, deliber
ately hurled a fellow countryman
named Stephen Giovanni down a
39-foot shaft on claim No. 19, Bo
nanza, on February 11. ' The victim
of the murderous assault was badly
bruised, but did not sustain serious In
juries. In explanation of his act, Cros
sette told between sobs a story which had
its beginning In a little village- under the
shadows of the snow-capped Alps.
In this village Crossette and Giovanni
both wooed the same dark-eyed beauty.
Giovanni was the successful suitor and
led the girl to the altar. Years sped on
and In accordance with Biblical admoni
tions young Giovanni appeared on the
scene. After four heirs had been born.
Giovanni deserted wife and children and
came to the United States.
After blacking boots for a year or so In
Hoboken, he joined the westward tide
and eventually landed in the Klondike.
There, as chance had it, he met his old
time rival. They renewed acquaintance,
burled the hatchet and formed a partner
ship.
Recently Giovanni received a letter
bearing the news that his wife had died
of sorrow, privation and hard work. The
ruin of the woman he had loved preyed
upon the mind of Crossette until he
sought, revenge In an attempt to murder
Giovanni. â¢Â¦ "^

It was supposed that the name of Har

before Oneal's bill had gathered In the
attention of the people. That bill en
ables the Governor to fill a vacancy oc
curlng during the recess of the Legis

Incumbent's term. Under the old. law a
real vacancy did # not exist on the expira
tion of a term of office, but by Oneal's
bill that difficulty will be removed, for
the Governor will hardly veto such a bill.
In the event that the bill becomes a law,
the Governor need eend no names at all to

Eenate bill 164 In the Assembly. This Is
the measure fixing the salaries of the

Francisco at 13000 per year. Sutro sought
to have the enacting: clause stricken out.
but his amendment was defeated and the
Lill was sent to engrossment and third
reading.
Sutro explained In defense of his amend

to have the Legislature settle a dispute
between the Ean Francisco Board oi Ed

arpued that the Board of Education was
in a better position than the Legislature
to linow what salary should be paid dep

Kisk paid that for some reason the
Board of Education had fixed the salary
of deputy superintendents at J1SO0, or less
than vice principals received- It was In

CONFESSES WHEN NOOSE
ENCIRCLES HIS NECK
SEATTLE. March 5.â Nome came with-
in a hair's breadth of having a lynching
bee on November 4, when the . ringleader
of a gang of thieves was caught by J. C.
Brown and a few other citizens. Harry
Chester was the man who felt a rope
around his neck, and it had such' an elec
trifying effect upon him that he made a
complete confession. Â¦ The vigilantes Im
mediately went after the remainder of the
gran?, and within a half hour had M. Co
hen, W. May and John Smith in jail. All
of the prisoners were subsequently held
for trial on charges of grand larceny. In
default of . $2000- bonds each, they were
committed to Jail. â¢ â¢ ,.â¢
Th6 men had been operating -on a Iarire
scale and were living in luxurious style
on the proceeds of their nefarious calling
Chester at first denied all knowledge of
the crimes laid at hlsdoor. Finally his
captors became impatient and produced a
rope, which was carefully looped over hia
neck.
Secured in this manner, Chester was
Â¦marched .'toward the nearest scantlinj?
Soon his courage deserted him and he told
how he and his gang had been stealing
right and left. At first he refused to tell
the names of hia confederates, but when
the rope was pulled a little tighter he
changed his mind and gave the informa
tion. k \

evening by Edward C. Johnson of the

defensive from the start and received a
severe ankle sprain. For this reason he
was unable to go on with the second bout
and forfeited the match.

Special Dispatch to Thm Call. ' ' "
SEATTLE. March 5.âTv"hen Captain
Bledsoe of Dawson married pretty Pearl
Lloyd, a variety actress, ha bellenred ho
had won a home and caught a prize.
Pearl, too, was laboring under * deJualon
âshe believed she. was marrying a mod
ern Monte Cristo Instead of a "busted"
Yukon River pilot. They soon, found they
were not suitably mated â at least she did
âand the captain was unceremoniously
thrown out by the petite actress).
These matrimonial differences would not
have caused much comment In Dawson
were it not for the fact that a respectabla
younjr lady. Miss Nina Moore, was trav
ellns all the way from San Francisco to
marry Captain Bledsoe. who had won her
heart w,hen he was in the city of. tha
Golden Gate last summer, and had ar
ranged for her to come In over the Ice andl
become his wife. He told her wonderful
stories of the richness of thÂ« Klondike
and of his vast interests.
When Miss Moore arrived In Dawson
great was her surprise to learn thtit her
intended was the husband of a dance hall
singer, who a few days previously had
ejected him from her domicile. Mfss
Moore immediately went to the Sisters of
Charity and ha* resided with them since,
endeavoring to decide on th*Â» best policy
to pursue. Many newly found friends hÂ»vÂ«
advised her to demand traveling expenses
from the captain, who Is under contract
as pilot with the Alaska Commercial
Company, and others, with more of bor
der roughness in their make-up. adTlsÂ«
that she shoot him.
Miss Moore is well known in San
Francisco, where she wu stenographer
for H. S. Crocker * Co. for a lone HmÂ«.
She was the first woman to pass thÂ© win
ter in Nome, and on her return was given
much space in the newspapers.

VANCOUVER, B. C, March 5.âOver
come by superstitious fear of the pres
ence of a ghost in one of the tunnels, thir
ty-five of the miners of the Silver Kins
mine, near Nelson, refused to- go to wqrk
yesterday. James Crawford says he en
countered the specter sitting In one of the
crosscuts between two tunnels. As he ap
proached the gaunt white figure, which
was that of a man fully nine feet In
height, it arose from its half stooping pos
ture and, shading the candle it held In ita
hand, started up the crosscut and disap
peared.
The frightened miner hurried to Ralns
vllle, the mine boss, who walked up tue
crosscut 100 feet. There the strange figure
appeared as before, with its back against
the side of the drift. By this time an
other miner came, and he and Rainsvllle
followed the apparition. Rainsvllle ad
vanced a step nearer, when it suddenly
turned and disappeared.
Then the whole mine force was distrib
uted through the mine. The first party
found the apparition in its usual position.
The ghost glided into the crosscut and the
men followed until they came to the party
at the other end, who had seen nothing.
A moment later most of their candles
were mysteriously extinguished and the
â¢miners stampeded to the mouth of the,
tunnel. Â¦'?*'Â¦' 'Â¦" ' â¢

Track Notes.
K. Matthews was given a week on tho.
ground by the judges for rough riding.
On horses that have a chance Howell is
uoir.g some excellent saddle work at Oak
land.
The officials of thÂ«) track across the bay
>aid yesterday that nothing suspicious
had been discovered in connection with
Owen Mounce's tardy ride astride Yel
lowtall on Monday.
Johnny Campbell seems to have Btrucic
his old-fashionf-d gait, for the horses un
der his charge are-"meeting with marked
success of late. Nearly ail of them are
leaped from "Lucky" Baldwin.
The grand stand at Overland Park, Den
ver, which was recently destroyed by
fire, will be replaced by a much more im
posing structure.
A STIRRING . finish between Cas
take. El Mido and Twinkler
marking the close of the mile
and a furlong selling event, the
trio flashing past the wire head?
apart, more than atoned for the defeat of
j three choices yesterday at Oakland. It
' was a horse race and no mistake, tickling
! the fancy ol the large crowd present im
mensely. Then, besides, there waE a dis
qualification to keep matters at the bub
bling point, quite in keeping with the tem
perature at the weather. Melkarth, a 15
! to 1 shot ridden by E. Matthews, fin.Iehe'1
! in -front of Mainstay for the second purse,
i but on Macklin's claim of foul lodged
! against Mattht-ws, the race was given to
Mainstay. Forty to 1 was laid about the
old sprinter.
: The lirst outsider to poke his head over
the winning mark first was Osmond, pi
i loted by Howell. Seven to 1 the ring laid
i against the Ryan castoJT, now trained by
I Lew McArthur, and in a drive he downed
I the favorite, Mike Strains, a length.
i Meadow Lark was a starter, but his trip
on the cars from Tanforan had not served
to sharpen hia speed. He never looked
dangerous.
This was followed by a six-furlong sell
i ing eprint, which . re-suited in the Mel
i karth-Mainstay mix-up. Nearly opposite
I the paddock Mainstay was thrown against
I the fence, and though Melkarth won by a
! couple of lengths was set back. This ac
| tion of the Judges gave Summer the place
and Letigcr third money. Fauntleroy,
astride Summer, met with poor, racing
! luck or he would have been returned win
! ner.
"Pi" Ruiz, who had the leg 'up on Jar
retierre dOr, suffered Irom an attack of
ennui, and Killdoe took the two-year-old
dash without a struggle. Bullman rode
the Burns & "Waterhouse youngster and
led from the start. Pepper Sauce outlast
ed Prestene, the other starter, for show
honors. The winner closed a 6 to 5 favor
ite in the betting.
Undoubtedly the presence in the saddle
of Romero kept many from speculating on
C'astake to win the nule and a furlong
number. At any rate, the Apache geid
ing's odds reached 7 to 1. Dominick pilot
ed El Mido and. as that horse looked best
on paper, perhaps, went to the
post a 6 to 5 chance. Twinkler
came out after a long retirement,
but as he showed rigns of lameness
did not get much support. For a time in
the race Mitten made the running. Then
Castake showed first, followed by the fa
vorite, ar.d later in thÂ»Â» stretch Twinkler
got up with the leaders. Almost an eighth
of a ml!e the trio fought it out, Romero,
hand riding only on Castake, reaching
the tape a head before the favorite. On
the outside Twinkler finished third, a
head farther away. But for being cut
off on the far turn Ostler Joe. a clo-ie
fourth, would have oetn hard to beat.
Rollick < the 7 to 5 /avorite made St.
Rica look cheap in tnÂ« six furlong run,
lifth to be decided. Meunce rode the win
ner and, despite Builman's energetic
"stick" work on St. Rica, the latter never
had a chance. Small Jack took ;he show
from Compass. â¢
At odds of 7 to 5 Stuart riding a very
trim looking race, landed Brown Prince
lirst for the final eix furlong spin. lie-
Albert, after making the pace, lost sec
ond place to William F.

Macy Finishes in Sensational Style in the Mile Race at
Tanforan, O'Connors Driving Finish Being a Feature
of the Day's Sportâ A Track Record Is Broken
The last race was productive of the
prettiest finish of the day. Macy. the
class horse with a good record on East
ern fields, was a strong favorite. O'Con
nor played the pilot'B part In good and
bad fashion, his hard driving finish re
deeming tho too careful work on the back
stretch. Macy started out a bad fifth and
did not improve until the. stretch. Alas
and L'imellght kept well to the front all
the way until the stretch, when Dlomed
spurted. and. took the lead. Macy coming
up gave Diomed a neck and neck race for
the wire. O'Connor went to his horse like
a demon and won by a . npek. Dlomed'o
evil behavior at the post delayed . the
start some ten minutes.
Thornwild, 6 to 1, surprised the three
year-old-nnd-over maidens in the seven
furlong race, the fifth on the card. Bren
hllda with Burns up was the favorite
and up to the stretch looked the winner.
Then Thornwild burst forward and fin
ished an easy winner. Onyx got the show.
Telephone Girl steered by Tommy Burns
took the monÂ»y In thfe flrtt race without
any crossing of wires or unnecessary de
lays. Off at the start Telephone Gir: gave
the numbers at every post. Her only
rival was Chante, ridden by O'Connor,
who took second place. Artena, the sec
ond choice, made the show.
Silurian, a 3 to 5 favorite mounted by
O'Connor, won the six j furlong event.
Edlnborough, on whom the play was
strong, led at the start, Esplrando.hold
ing on all the way up the back stretch.
At the paddock Silurian was let out and
finished first In a driving race.' Edlnbor
ough getting the place and Esplrando the
show.
Th?n came the jumpers, good, bad and
indifferent. Olinthun was coupled with
Palatine and sold at 4 to 5. Tom Sharkey
tried it again, but not for long, going
nut at the second jump. Hohcnlohe, who
carried a great deal of money, scrambled
over the second barrier, spilling the rider.
Acrobat proved a good enough performer
to get the tail end of the money, but the
raco was all Olinthus, who got so . far
away from his Jumping rivals that It was
a walk in for first money. Gllberto and
Acrobat fought it out for the place.
Again Winnie O'Connor . demonstrated
his ability to win against odds by his
superior riding skill. Mounted on Pupil
In the fourth rape over six and a half
furloi;f?s, a third choice In the betting,
lind closed up back of the field, he Worked
his way out from the atretch to the pad
dock and pa.ssed tho entire bunch cf five.
Sloan wttli tb>Â» leg on Isaline, an 8 to 5
favorite, was last at tne start, bui went
slowly past Owenstoro and Vohlccr while
Pupil fell back. Then Isaline kept to the
fore down th<s stretch . until passed by
O'Connor on Pupil. Players of Pup'l were
making theater snow of their tickets
when the paddock was reached. Then
the unexpected happened.' This Pupil
the fourth raco the track record
was lopped off half a second. Pupil

FAST work on a fast track, the fa
vorites dividing honors with the
long"-shots, was the hoof amuse
ment n.t Tanforan yesterday. In
By Louis Honig.
At the close of Mr. Cleveland's speech
adjournment was taken until 2 o'clock.
The. afternoon session was mainly devot
ed to the consideration of the constitution
and by-laws presented, by . the executive
committee. No final action was taken and
no pÂ«rmanent organization was effected.
The wool growers of America have an asso
ciation, of their own and there ia no reason
why the cattlemen should not have one. There
Is no reason why a cattleman should con
tribute to an association which does not pro
tect his interests. The West belongs to the
cattlemen. They were the people who re
claimed 'the country from - the Indians. Who
ever heard of a sheepman . being killed by In
dians? Many of us who are in the cattle
business have had relatives killed by thÂ« In
dians. I had a son killed by Indians, but
there were no sheepmen in tho country at that
time. Sheepmen I are too slow to catch up
with any danger. I am referring to those men
who their all Invested in five dogs, a
wagon and a few eheep. These men have no
respect for the rights of othefs. Wo In our
country -have no trouble with them, because
there Is .a certain tax levied which keeps them
out of the State. I have never myself had
any trouble with sheepmen. I have avoided
them when I could and they are anyway too
Blow (o associate with cattlemen.
A. C. Cleveland of Nevada delivered an
address which evoked j hearty applause.
Mr. Cleveland said: >.-.-.Â¦
A. S. Van Doran explained the object*
of the association, whlon. he said, proposes
to work to secure legislative protection
of the ranges for the cattle growers and
to enable them to meet the increasing do
mand for beef both at home and abroad.
The entire territory west of the Missouri
River is represented, the largest delega
tions being those of Colorado, Wyoming',
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada
A temporary organization was effected at
Salt Lake City during the recent conven
tion of the National Livestock Associa
tion. The -convention will decide whether
the new association shall be Independent
of the National Livestock Association or
work as a subdivision of It. The officers
of the national association are watching
the projected organization Jealously,
ready to co-operate If it Is to be an aux
iliary, but to tight It If It Is to be inde
pendent and a rival.
Welcoming addresses were made at the
morning session of the convention by
Governor Orman and Mayor Johnson, and
responses were made on behalf of the or
ganization by F. S. Lusk of California
and J. C. Van Doran of New Mexico.

material In regard to Swift, the other de
fendant, but he was not on trial.
Considerable argument followed, durlnc
which Assistant District Attorney Deu
prey admitted that the only proof he had
against the two defendants was that
Burns, as chairman of the Buildings Com
mittee, and O'Brien, as Inspector, certi
fied to the correctness of the accounts for
lumber. He had no proof by any person
that they divided the money between
them.
Attomey Riordan contended that the
prosecution must first prove a conspiracy
and then the overt act.
The Judge remarked that the prosecu
tion must have evidence to prove a con
spiracy before the defendants could be
convicted. It must be shown that the de
fendants were concerned In the commis
sion of a crime, whether directly commit
ting the act constituting the offense or
aiding and abetting In Its commission.
Deuprey admitted that he had no evi
dence that the defendants knew that the
claims were false. There was only the
circumstance that they certified to the
claims beln? correct.
The Judge, after hearing that admission,
said tt was a waste -of time for the Jury
to stay and he < releasÂ«d them till this
morning:, as Attorney Riordan promised to
submit authorities during the afternoon In
support of his contention. In the after
noon he submitted authorities and the
can? was continued till this morning, when
I>euprey will be heard in reply.
At the morning session E. D. Swift was
put on the stand, but he declined to testify
on the ground that he is a co-defendant-

The Challenger saileJ from Oyster Har

for Kahului, H. I. On December IS, in
latitude 42 deg. H mln. north, longitude

a heavy gale, in which the supports of thÂ«
main topsail were carried away. The next
day cuite a number of the sails were
blown out of the bo.t ropes and the ship
betran to labor. On December 20 the main
topmast, with everything attached, went
by the board and soon afterward the mlz
zen mast, being left without any support,
.followed the main tpnmast. The bul
warks and railing were smashed into
kindling, the lifeboat on the port Quarter
was stove in and the ship sprang a leak.
The Challenger was now 150. miles south-

Chief Sullivan Instructed to CI0S2
the Disreputabl-e Houses
Situated on Dupont
Street
The Police Commissioners, In accord
ance with th2 decision of the Superior
Court, decided last night to reinstate Wil
liam Price to his former rank of lieuten
ant of i>olice. Price was disrated to the
rank cf sergeant by the oJd Board of Po
lice Commissioners. He was deprived of
the right of a hearing, and on this 6how
ii-C the Superior Court a 6hort time ago,
after the facts in the case had been sub
mitted, rendered a decision restoring him
to his former rank and ordering the Board
of Police Commissioners to reinstate him.
When the mandate or the Superior
Court had been read to the Commission
er* last night. ex-Assistant District Al
tcrney Black, who represented Price, re
vitwed the case at length and asked that.
is. view of the decision of the Superior
Court, the ex-lieutenant be reinstated.
President New hall asked if Price, in case
the beard decided to reinstate him, would
demand his back pay as a lieutenant of
police.
.b.-ck replied that Price waived all
claim to any money that was coming to
Llsi eir.ee tls disrateinent.
Commissioner Wallace argued that if
the board decided to comply with the
mandate of the Superior Court the other
cScers who were disrated by the old
board were equally entitled to reinstate
ment.
Attorney Black contended that Price's
case was not the same as the cases of
other disrated cfEcers. as they had made
eo attempt to be restored to their rank
untU Price had instituted suit.
Commissioner Howell thought It proper
to obey the mandate cf the Superior Court
and euggested that the board reinstate
Price.
After eome further discussion a resolu
tion was Introduced reinstating: the dis
rated oScer. It was adopted by a vote of
ihree to one. Commissioner Wallace being
the only member of the board to vote
tf u :r..-: It, although he announced that
he thought the oSicer had been unjustly
treated by the r>Id board.
The board did r.nt thir.k It tr'.thin Its
province to crier the policemen under Its
control to Â¦undergo vaccination and a
comrnKnica-ilon from the Board of Health
asking- for such an order was s'.aced on
file.
Rev. Father 'Wj-ir.aa appeared before
Â¦the commission and pr^test^d ag-ainst the
existence of di!=rer>i:table houses in the
vicinity cf the proposed St. Mary's Square.
"It w-.i.Â« only a fÂ«>w- <iiys ago." remarked
the revwrwwJ gentleman in decrj'lng' the
evil, 'that Srrgeant of Police Tobin ln-
Cocxbed n-.e that peverai notorious houte?
cr. St. Mary street had been reopened. I
understand that the tr.mates were arrest
ed nr.d fÂ»re a waiting tilal in the Police
Court. There are a number of these
houses on Dupont street and some means
cucr.t to be taken to close them."
Ct::ef Sullivan replied that he was In
favor at Fuppre5sir.?: tbÂ«.' houses, but as
the [mnalea would then move Into the reo-
Id^nce portion of the city and flaunt their
(shame h<? was at a ioss to know what to
do in the rnatter.
Commissioner Newhall argued that ln
arrn-jch as The existence of such houses
liad lÂ»en officially called to the attention
of the board, he was in favor of imme
diate action. On hie motion the Chief
was instructed to close all the dens along
Dupont street and In the vicinity of the
proposed ' St. Mary's Square.
Policeman John Porter was fined 5109
for reporting- for duty in an Intoxicated
condition and John D. Shine was dis
miwtfri frcm the force for being absent
from duty.
The C'-mmi5si-ir.ers Geeidei to renew

VELOCITY OF THE Â¦WINDâ J. W. F..
Ripon, Cal. The velocity of the wind Is
measured by an instrument called aa
anemometer, the simpltat being what Is
generally known as the hemispherical
cup, which consists of four hemispheres or
cups fixed to the ends of two horizontal
iron bars crossing each other at right
angles, and supported by a vertical axU
which turns freely. The cups revolve with
a,thlrd of the wind's velocity and the in
strument Is so constructed that 500 revolu
tions are made " while a mile of wind*
passes over it. The, re volutions are resla
tered by a system of wheels similar to
those of a gas-meter. The difference be
tween two readings gives the number of
revolutions passed over during the inter
vening time, from which the miles can be
calculated and the rate per hour. In me
teorological observatories pressure anemo
meters are used. By these the force of
the wind is arrived at by a method differ
ent from that given. ; The force is reel*
tered by means of a. pencil on paper that

LITTLE GIRL'S COSTUME.
This dress for a girl of eleven to four
teen years is of chamois colored cloth,
trimmed with Ivory cloth and string col
ored guipure. The short sleeves are fin
ished off with bouillonnees of white
moussellne de sole, tied in with black vel
vet. The waistband Is also of black vel
vet.
It began by her refusal to recognize the Mexican
Minister. If she omitted anÂ» slight or snub, even
in her exile she is sorry for it: She seems to have
had the sympathy of female legationdom from the
Continent generally, and, so to speak, they have put
a bent pin in every chair that Scnor Azpiros sat in.
The feud finally became. the terror of the White
House Vnd the State Department! It was air the
worse' because it was not a man's quarrel. It is hard
to handle ladies, who defy any power on earth to
riake them associate with any one when they take a
notion not to do. so. So, for a long time the ghost of
Maximilian and.the vacant face of his demented wife
have refused, to "down" at every diplomatic function,
until it became necessary to take Madame the Bel
gian Minister's wife away. That fact in itself is evi
dence that she wori her campaign and set the. pace for
her successors. It seernsVthat the/only way to keep
the diplomatic peace is for Belgium to send a bache
lor Minister to Washington. -. ' .
It has come back like a wraith to disturb diplo
matic society in Washington. The men in the lega
tions are not responsible for it. "But the ladies, God
bless 'em," as the toast runs, have been avenging the
wrongs of Carlotta and her Prince, until the Belgian
Minister has had to take his wife and go where it is
not so torrid socially a| the lady has made Washing
ton.
All this was long ago, but it is well understood that
it is among the grudges laid up by the Old World
against the New.
Senator Gwin said of- him that while his empire
was cracking under his feet he studied botany^ gave
garden parties and stuffed birds. So his ambitious
scheme went glimmering, as such have gone before,
and he was stood up and shot by the Mexicans one
morning at Queretaro, dying like a brave and honest
gentleman. Then his Princess went home and her
reason faded, and she lived on, a melancholy reminder
of the fleeting quality of ambition and human hopes
and dreams.
And then one day r-mbition came as a tempter to
the milk white castle and Maximilian followed the
siren to Mexico to found an empire. He was art
amiable Prince, given to luxurious tastes, and had in
him but little of the rough and ready fiber that quali
fies empire builders.
In the romance of royal life on the Continent it fell
out one day, that the Belgian Princess Carlotta mar
ried the Austrian Prince Maximilian, and the pair
entered upon what was regarded as an ideal life in
beautiful .Miramar.
THE foreign legations at Washington make up
the diplomatic society of the capital. While that
circle touches general society,* it has troubles of
its own. ;.. Â¦ ' ;

How many a homo has changed in its
atmosphere entirely through the club in
fluence! Where formerly the dinner-table
conversation was a mixture of trivialities
or even worse gossip, now the topic of
the dav at the club takes the children into
new fields, and vigorous discussion or
research is the result. A winter of the
study of Holland in the club some years
since was a, liberal education to a large
family in the history of that famous
country because of the Interest of the
young people of the household in finding
out facts the club Ptudy overlooked. 'A
genuine rivalry made evenings all - too
short and stimulated both intellect and

The chief objection raised to clubs tor
.Â¦women is that women must be mothers,
and the whole life must be regulated with
reference to that high calling. But does
the mother rise to the diprnity of her posi
tion if she is simply 'a physical mother?
No. As one mothsr says: "Let her life
be full to the brim of happiness, knowl
edge, mental and physical activity*, let
lofty emotions and vigorous thoughts fill
her "being; let her whole existence expand
to its fullest extent*, let her forget mother

"You're the boss of the Woman's Club, I

the street, not long ago. "Well, I want to

was terrible sad; she lost a boy a year

TRUE VS. FALSE LABELS.
THE Internal Revenue Department has decided
to put a stop to the sale of domestic : liquors
under foreign labels. This is .right. The fraud
is a mean one and harms the domestic producer. The
California clarets sold under French labels are usually
inferior. Falsely labeled as a Poutet claret, second-class
California â¢claret is preferred to our good red wines
undertheir own label.. As a rule poor wine takes refuge
under a French label, ;and consumers who ;would re
ject it as swill under its own name pay three prices
for it and drink it worshipfully under a 'French* alias.
In this way wines that never ought to see market ar
all, or go to it prematurely, figure at hotels as,St..
Julien, and Chateau this and. Chateau that, when they
should be. spilled or- distilled, and their purveyors
should be fined for a fraud. ' >-
California wine-making has greatly improved since
those who engaged In the business have discovered
that vineyards are not to be planted nor wine made
by the rule of thumb. When General Naglee hunted
for brandy in the soil, and then tore up vineyard after
vineyard until he secured the right grape to get the
brandy out of the ground, he marked the beginning
of the scientific era in viticulture. Following him
came Charles Wetmore, hunting white and red dry
wines in the ground, with the, assurance that if chem
istry found them there the right grape could be had
to extract, them. When he found the right soils in
Livermore Valley its development began, and those
standard vintages move themselves and give their
color in the cup in testimony to his genius. The rule
of thumb has passed away. The cut and try period
in the vintage of this State was its archaic age. The
sacchrometer and application of alcoholic affinity, the
knowledge of the chemical laboratory, have changed
methods and results. Our wines need no counterfeit
label, nor do they need to go to market masked like
a stage robber and bearing an assumed name like a
pickpocket.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has taken
the, right position, and his agents should soon eradi
cate every label factory. There are some in this city.
There are wholesale wine houses here which accom
modate the retailer by putting up his case goods in
foreign labels. Poor Zinfandel goes out of them gew
gawed as to label and flirting as St. Julicn, and do
mestic brandy goes its way as Hennessey Three Star.
These houses should be raided and their nefarious
fraud be made unprofitable.
But there is still. another form of fraud that is for
bidden by the internal revenue law and should be
watched, detected and punished. The law against
false labels applies to any label or"brand that misrep
resents the character of the contents of a package.
A case in point was the celebrated bogus brandy ship
ment that occurred a few years ago. Forty. barrels
of raw corn high wines, from the Willow Springs dis
tillery at Omaha, only six weeks out of the worm, was
mixed with -fifteen barrels of yearling brandy and the
whole colored with burnt sugar, flavored with cognac
oils and stretched with water to make no barrels,
branded, "Pure Old California Grape Brandy." This
lurid mixture was shipped illegally in defiance of the
Naval Officer, who exposed the fraud and sought to
stop it, and after he overtook it in New York and
continued the exposure the Treasury Department
actually ordered the label changed and permitted its
shipment to Liverpool! The original label was a
fraud ar.d the change ordered by the department was
a fraud also; each violated the law. The Internal
Revenue Department should have an eye to enforce
ment of the law against all false labels, whether they
misrepresent the origin of the article, as the French
labels do, or its character, as was the case with the
bogus brandy. Whisky labels and brands are changed
sll the time, though this is forbidden by law. The
brand of reimported whiskies is defiantly changed
right in the Government warehouses, with but little
effort at concealment. A few stout fines and con
fiscations will put an end to these pernicious and un
lawful practices.
A PRIMARY ELECTION LAW.
REPORTS from Sacramento are not encouraging
to those who expect the passage of a satisfac
tory primary election law. Whenever the
measure is taken up it is met by so much in the way
of opposition, and so many motions to amend are in
terposed, that little or no progress toward the en
actment of the law has yet been made. Such reports
coming at this late day in the session should arouse
the people to demand action. The enactment of a
" valid and fair primary law is one of the things impera
tively required of the Legislature. It is, in tact, a
measure of urgencv. The interests of honest politics
demand it.
A primary law cannot be a partisan measure, as it
Â¦will apply equally to the primary elections of all par
ties. That being so, there can be no party antagon
isms on the subject. The only divergence of interests
on an issue of the kind is between those of the peo
ple and those of the political bosses and corporations
which support the bosses. Therefore if the Legisla
ture fail to pass the desired law it will be well under
stood that the bosses have been strong enough to
It is to be borne in mind that the candidates of all
parties in the last campaign were pledged to enact a
primary law. The pledges were definite and clear.
As soon as the Supreme Court declared the former
Inw invalid the demand arose at once for the enact
ment of a new one. The proceedings which followed
the decision of the court showed that without such a
law primary elections are hardly better than so many
farces. Frauds of every kind, from sneaking tricks
to open violence, were committed by the bosses and
their pangs to control the primaries, and in many
districts the rank and file of the voters had hardly any
voice whatever in determining who should represent
them in the conventions which nominated the can
didates of their party.
A* soon as the issue became one of practical poli
tics The Call pointed out that the only obstacle in
the way of passing a 5atisfactory law to regulate the
conduct of primaries was the opposition sure to be
made by the bosses and corrupt corporations. That
warning The Call has repeated time and again, and
it is now evident the warning was needed. The ses
sion is drawing to a close, and no measure designed
for protecting the riffhts of voters at the primaries has
yet been enacted. It is time for the people to speak
A dispatch from Indianapolis reports that "a fero
cious Bengal tiger"' recently escaped from its cage in
the zoo of that city and made an attack upon a wild
ass from South Africa. The conflict was short. The
wild ass kicked the tiger into something like a coma
tose condition in the first round. The incident in
itself is slight, but in these days when so much interest
is taken in the conflict between the tiger and the don
key factions in the Democratic party it may be worth
noting as a pointer on the. result of the big fight.
The Westminster Gazette of London, in comment
ing upon the organization in this country known as
Daughters of the Revolution, spoke of the members
as "dandy women"; and now the- ladies may know
â¢what sort of reputation they have abroad. Th-y
might as well call themselves the daughters of Yankee
It is stated that one of 1 the men who was foremost
in burning the negro Alexander near Leavenworth
has whirled in and married a negro woman, and now

Tlie ladies of Ssn Jose who devised recipes for
using prunes in making bread, soup, salad, jam, jellies,
preserves, candy and pickles deserve credit for thei
talent; and it will hereafter be a very poor bill of

BRITAIN'S COSTLY WAR.
REPORTS of la-;t week from London announc
ing that- Dewet was in full flight at the head of
a" disorganized band, that Botha had made over
tures for surrender, and that the end of, the South
African war is in sight, have not been confirmed. In
fact it is now stated that the officials of the British
War Office do "not believe the reports. Kitchener,
it is said, has not yet completed the organization of
his army of mounted infantry designed to sweep the
Transvaal and consequently is not yet in a position
to force the fighting and close the war.
In the meantime the cost of the struggle mount?
higher and higher. The cry of the Government to
the people is the refrain of Kipling's famous song:
"Pay, pay, pay!" It was'stated at the opening of the
present session of Parliament that the war expendi
tures up to that date amounted to about $407,000,000.
Since then the same large rate of expenditure has
been continued; so that if the war should be speedily
ended its total cost in money to the empire will hardly
rmount to less than $600,000,000. That is a huge sum
to pay for empire; and it is doubtful whether the
profits of trade and commerce with the conquered
province will ever yield a fair return upon the invest-
The enormous cost of. the war must be. met by new
taxes and it is not easy for the Ministers to find a
means of levying the new burdens "of taxation without
in some measure deviating from the free trade system.
It is stated that taxes on beer and tobacco and the
income tax have about reached the limit of public
endurance. Those laxes it appears are already as
heavy as the traffic will bear. It is now suggested
that as some sort of tariff duties on imports will have
to be imposed, it would be well for the Government
to discard the free tiade principle altogether and
adopt a fiscal policy, which, while providing revenues
for the Government, will also protect the industries of
the country.
Until the Ministry submits its revenue bill the ques
tion for. the public remains one of academic interest
only.. Up to this time the discussions on the subject
have been vague and indefinite. The suggestion' of
the adoption of the protective principle comes f'om
many sources, .but has not yet been taken up by any
eminent statesman. - Evidently the free trade senti
ment of the people, is still too strong for politicians
to oppose, but it is by no means certain it will-re
main so after the new tax bill has been" submitted.
When the British taxpayer perceives what he will have
to pay for the conquest of the Transvaal. and remem
bers that he has to pay it in the face of an indust-ial
competition so 'keen that he can hardly make a living,
he will begin to look upon the doctrines of Cobden
from another point of view. He will find himself
confronted hot by a theory but by a condition, and
it is not at all unlikely that in the. face of that very
serious condition many of them will come to the con
clusion that the principles of free trade are not so
universally true as they supposed.
Thus, while the war in South Africa is prolonged
W^ cannot sympathize with the Eastern folks, but
they might share our gladness if they would. Th~
way to California is open to all and there is room
here for a flower-garlanded home for several million?
of the folks of .the shivering East. Let them come
West, where there is no ruffian weather, but where
the sunshine floods . the roads _ and the homes and
makes ihe whole land beautiful..
â¢All of that is very sad, but -we cannot sympathize
with it. It is impossible for us to gtt up even a
polite shiver of condolence with those who are thu3
suffering from blighting blasts and diminishing coal
bins. Everything around us is too genial, too glow
ing and too altogether lovely for us to so much as
understand how there can be any one who objects *o
the sweet and sunny days of glorious, blossoming
March.
'.The Boston Transcript has 'recently,' been moved to
express a wail of discontent over the sort of winter
the twentieth century has imposed upon' the Atlantic
coast. The Transcript admits there has not been this
winter anything of what Elizabeth Stuart Phelps once
called "ruffian weather," but it adds: "We have had
a continuous performance of cold weather that gets
to be as monotonous as any other continuous going
on. Hardly a break in the cold has there been since
Christmas time. Sunshine we have had in plenty, but
of a heartless quality â it has always been rather stern
and reserved. Somehow it hasn't flooded roads or
rooms as it ought. . Not once has it been so benign
as to inaugurate a season of 'thaw.' Upon January
thaws the householder has heretofore counted as tend
ing to . make his calls on his coal pile intermittent.
So hereafter we shall call that 'soft spell' a tradition,
not a climatic habit with us."
While that racket of crfugbs and sneezes and curses
makes life mournful in the East the happy dweller on
the Pacific Coast walks abroad in the blessed sun
shine, watches the fruit trees blossom, catches i the
fragrance of flowers and the song of birds,* and ' in
rapture declares March weather to be elysian. Evi
dently the inauguration ceremonies of the President
of the United States should be held in San Fran
cisco, and the President, after, taking the oath of office
amid the blisses of our fair days, could then go East
to take up the worries of administration in the stormy
East.
ONCE more an inauguration day has dawned
upon Washington amid clouds and rain and
wind. | Once more thousands of people will
talk of the glories of the day. with voices made hoarse
by colds caught while watching the paradyor listen
ing to the inaugural address.' Once more some hun
dreds of people will be sick for a week by reason of
the exposure. ; Once more there will arise a demand
for a change in the date of inauguration, and once
more the country will be compelled to listen to de
nunciations of stormy March. ' â¢ '

terests of club and federation work, from
the beautiful city home to the log cabin
of a mining camp, I have found that
everywhere the most enthusiastic club
women are, as the Irishman would say,
the men-of the family!
Some one has sai.l: "The cure for the
evils of liberty is more liberty." The fu
ture will bring us the man and woman,
face to face, not leaning one upon (he
other, but upright â partners, friends, com
rades, lovers.
Finally, let us balance our gains and
losses in considering the influence of the
woman's club.
We have gained the out-of-door habit;
we have lost the "orazy-quilt" and im
possible fancy-work habit. We have
gained an independence and freedom of
dress; we are fast losing the long skirt
and the heavy, unhealthful garments.
We have gained a fair sense of the social
truth that "an injury to one is the con
cern of all"; we have lost the old, narrow,
selfish love for our own and our own only.
We have gained the ability to discuss
subjects in an impersonal manner and
without bitterness. We have lost the old
sewing-society faahion of weeping over a
difference of opinion with a neighbor. We
have gained in some measure the knowl
edge that should belong to every citizen
of nation. State or city. We have lost the
helpless ignorance which has kept unjust
laws regarding women on our statute
books for all past time.
We have gained to the people hundreds
of libraries, many. city ordinances to bet
ter promote the cleanliness and virtue of
our homes, the preservation of many
sacred historical spots, the genuine help
and uplifting of multitudes of the tempted
and the poor, the sick, the unhappy, the
overlooked ones in' life's road: we have
lost the excluslveness. the pride of birth,
position and wealth which has been over
thrown by the democracy of the club.
We have gained to some extent knowl
edge of business affairs; we have lost the
old helplessness wnich made every wo
man with property a prey to the nephew
or cousin-in-law or speculative relative
who lay in wait to devour her patrimony.
We are gaining the idea that mere be
longings are not the whole of the home,
and that cheerfulness, intelligence and
fresh air are more to be desired than
much furniture and bric-a-brac; we have
lost the old fashion of personally scrub
bing all the paint in the house twice a
year and â wonder of wonders â we have
even gone so far as to put off washing
from the sacred Mofriday to another day
under Btress of circumstances.
More Gains to Follow.
ing women of the stay-in-the-house habit
and forcing them into the open air.
"Whether from the fact, that in the old
days much of the work of women was
done indoors or from the Idea of their
delicacy and inability to battle with the
elements, it Is true that the average or
usual woman has always had the stay-in
the-house habit. Twenty-five years ago
women went out, of doors only when
called by the exigencies of family life and
the few social duties which the time de
manded. Many instances could- be cited
of women in middle life who were ex
pected to take only the weekly outing of
church-going. But the club has brought
committee work, classes, city improve
ment societies, Pingree gardens, kitchen
gardens, institutional work and social
service, all- of which mean more cr less
time out of doors. Instead of the pale,
silent mother at the lunch or dinner table
comes the vigorous, cheerful, happy wo
man, full of the day's work and experi
ences â a better friend, a better comrade
and bringing' into the house an infinitely
more wholesome atmosphere. No tonic,
no medicine, no science, can take the
place of this out-of-door habit in its ef
fects upon the mind, body and well-being
of present and future generations.
What the Unmarried Woman Gains.
Again there is the effect of the club
upon the home of the fingle woman, and
indirectly its influence upon matrimony.
Not bo many years ago the unmarried
woman had no home; she "Just lived
with somebody." The "somebody" either
Ignored her existence or made her the
drudge of the. family. She had no position,
â¢no interests, nothing to live for, and was
constantly reminded that even in death
she would not have the privilege and
honor of having "Mrs." carved upon her
tombstone! In those days before the club
had taught women that there were beau
tiful pleasures in the world. Interesting
things to do, helpful lives to be lived,
even though not married, a woman was
almost forced into matrimony. We all
know the stigma which .attached to an
"old maid"; but to-day the "girl bache
lor" is as free and happy, and $ at lib
erty to .havo almost as many pleasures
and interests, as the man who has chosen
not to marry, because perhaps he, like the
woman, has not seen the one who can fill
his life and make it complete. Best of all
the single woman is permitted to have her
home, her own home, her household
goods; she has learned through the. club
that there is helpful companionship and
recognition, and that life may be full and
rich. This woman will marry for the sole
and only reason why a woman should
enter. into that blessed state, not to es
cape a degrading and unfortunate posi
tion, which was forced upon her because
of the old-time traditions, and hers will
be the true marriage and the ideal home.

Those who were present at the trans-

never forget the genuine burst of laughter
and, withal, the sympathetic thrill which
went through the. audience at the tell
ing of the story of why a woman in
Oklahoma .wished to belong to a club.
She' lived in a if mote country district and
was oblijred to ride or drive many miles
to attend the club meetlne. ""What's the
use o* you goln'?" demanded her husband.
"Hain't you got nice aconery out here?"
"Yes. John, I have," said the little woman.
"I've â¢ got scenery and I've got you; but
it's my opinion that Eve in the garden of
Eden was; glad to sea the cherubim and
the flaming swordâ she got so tired of
just Adam and scenery."

Great Rejoicing.
AMSTERDAM,. March 5.â Queen Wll
helmlna and the Prince Consort entered
this city in state to-day. The royal par
ties were received 'by the principal au
thorities â¢ and conducted to the royal pa
vllion. where had gathered a brilliant ar
ray of officials, including the Governor of
the province of Northern Holland and
high military, naval, Judicial and civil dig
nitaries.
The burgomaster of Amsterdam deliv
ered an address of welcome. The proces
sion In state carriages, escorted by troops,
then traversed the streets of the capital,
which, in spite of the rain, were packed
with throngs of enthusiastic subjects. The
route to the palace was lined by the civic
guards and troops- of the garrison. Sa
lutes were fired as the procession ad
vanced and the progress of the royal par
ty was signaled by the ringing of church
bells.
The royal cortege was not long, but suf
ficiently varied to be of Interest. It was
led by a sduadron of Hussars and a
mounted band. The horpes and carriages
of the cortege were brilliantly capari
soned and the outriders and footmen wore
the vari-colored state liveries.
The royal equipage, drawn by eight
horses, was preceded by a mounted guard
of honor composed of the Queen's aids-de
camp, who, brilliant In gold and colors,
were the center of attraction. On either
Bide of the royal carriage rode the mili
tary officers. The procession was closed
by-a fine body of cavalry.
The Queen and the Prince Consort were
evidently greatly pleased at the enthusi
asm of the reception and bowed unceas
ingly to the crowds along the line of
march. At the palace the Queen mother
awaited her daughter. After this greet
ing Queen Wilhelmina and the Prince
Consort appeared upon the palace balcony
in response to the vociferous cheers of the
throng which had been permitted to gath
er in front of the royal palace.
Mrs. Henry Piper, wife of former Chief
Deputy County Clerk Piper, Is nursing a
sore back and a swelling 'on her side, be
sides doctoring many bruises and black
and blue, spots, the result of her encounter
with a brutal collector and a colored
piano mover.
Some time ago Mrs. Piper bought a
piano from the Heine Company, a piano
firm, doing business at 217 Geary street.
She agreed, to pay for the piano at the
rate of J7 per months and made payments
aggregating in all $210. Mrs. Piper then
decided she would like to have another In
strument and arranged to exchange for
another piano, for which she agreed to
pay J375, the firm allowing $155 for the
piano offered Â¦ in exchange. Payments
were regularly made on the instrument at
the rate of ?7 per month until Decernber 28
last. / For two months the Pipers wore
pressed for money and had toput the pay
ing of the Installments off. Finally Piper
went down to see W. F. Gibson, attorney
for the Heine Company, and offered to
pay the balance due on the piano In full
If the time of payment was extended un
til April. If the payment was not made
then. Piper told the attorney he would
willingly surrender the piano and relin
quish all claim to the same. Gibson told
Piper he deemed that a very fair proposi
tion and had no doubt Heine would be
glad to accept It, so Piper says. He sent
no word to the contrary to Piper and so
both he and Mrs. Piper felt confident that
the matter was amicably settled, they de
clare.
On Saturday about noon William
Woenne, collector for the Heine Company,
prepented himself at the Piper home at
sÂ» Birch avenue and demanded admit
tance. . Mrs. Piper, who had answered his
bell, stood Just within the door which she
had partly opened and asked Woenne
what he wanted.
"I want the piano," said Woenne. "Let
me in."
"My husband has arranged all about
the piano," replied Mrs. Piper, "and you
had better come again when he Is at
home." - Â¦Â¦*Â¦< .;.-.
But Woenne insisted that he was going
to enter the house right then and ther?
and cart off the piano, and when Mrs.
Piper forbade him the right to enter. ho
struck her a blow In the side that raised
a lump as bis as his cruel fist, she alleges.
Passing over Mrs. Piper's prostrate body
the brutal collector entered the house and
marched Into the little sitting room where
the piano was. "
"By that time," said Mrs. Piper, as she
told of the assault yesterday, "I -was
on my feet again and ordered him
to leave the house. His only answer
was to rain blows down upon me. He
struck me on the shoulders, the arms, the
chest and the back. I succeeded in pro
tecting my face by holding a little chair
In front of It. After he had about ex
hausted me with his blows Woenne called
a colored piano mover in and ordered him
to take the piano away.. I cried and for
bade him to lay hands upon the Instru
ment and thereupon the colored brure
struck me several blows. When I couli
defend myself no longer I rushed to the
doorway and seating- myself upon the step
that led to the street, said! 'You will have
to lift that piano over me. ' This did not
worry Woenne. though. He gave me a
kick In the small of the back that landol
me almost unconscious upon the street.
While I lay there suffering they carried off
the piano."
Piper swore out a warrant yesterday
for the arrest of Woenne and John Penn.
the colored man. Penn was arrested dur
ing the day and later released on bond"
furnished by the Heine Piano Company.
The case will come up before. Judge
Itlogan this morning-.

DECLARES KILLING OF
OLIVERIA JUSTIFIABLE
Coroner's Jury at Bakersfield Returns
a Verdict Exonerating Mrs.
Silva.
BAKERSFIELD, March 5.â Justifiable
homicide was the verdict returned by the
Coroner's jury to-day at the end of the
Inquest over the body of Manuer Oliverla.
who was phot and killed yesterday by Mr?.
Frank Sllva. the mother pf the girl he had
married only the day before. This ver
dict was rendered as a result of the evi
dence given by Mrs. Silva and her two
daughters, who swore that the cause of
the tragedy was the fact that Oliveria had
victimized Emequilina Sllva, the 15-year
old sister of the bride.
After the marriage on Sunday, when
Oliverla and his young wife had departed
for their new home. Emequilina weepingly
told her mother of Oliverla's crime. This
greatly enraged the mother. W hen Oli
verla -visited her the next morning Mrs.
Sllva upbraided him. A bitter quarrel
followed, resulting in the killing.
Mrs. Silva and her two daughters acted
perfectly cool and composed in giving this
testimony. Their stories exactly cor
roborated. The young bride showed
marked fidelity to her mother as against
the dead man.
It was also brought out by the testi
mony that while the wadding feast was In
full blast on Sunday George Cordoza In
formed the Sllvas that Oliveria had a
wife and children back in Portugal. This
created consternation for a time, but was
apparently smoothed over and the feast
continued.

ENGLAND MAY PLACE
A DUTY UPON SUGAR
Proposition Has for One Purpose the
Increase in the Revenue of
the Country.
LONDON, March 5.â The Chancellor of
the Exchequer. Sir Michael Hlcks-Beacn.
said a prominent member of the House
of Commons to-night, will probably In
troduce a duty on sugar In the forth
coming budget and will perhaps add a
countervailing duty. A member of the
Ministry said:
_"I can only say that this serious de
parture from England's historic prin
ciples 'of free trade Is under discussion,
as the provisions of the budget are re-
Hgiouslv kept secret until announced In
the Houte of Commons. However, if
sugar is not taken off the free list there
will be a large number of disappointed
Conservatives. On the other hand the
introduction of such a motion will meet
with the most fierce opposition from the
present Liberals and old-time champions
of free trade.
"The movement In favor of such a step
is due, firstly, to the almost utter decay
of England's refining industry: secondly,
to the careful studv of the success of
American sugar under tne present sys
tem: and, thirdly, to the dire necessity of
the Government to raise fund3 by other
means than increasing the already enor
mous direct taxation. For some time an
Influential committee of the House of
Commons has been dealing with the sub
ject. After the recent controversy be
tween Russia and the United States over
sugar this committee decided to make the
matter one of debate In the House of
Commons on March 4. James Reid, mem
ber of the House of Commons from Green
ook. the center of the sugar refining In
dustry, was appointed spokesman; but at
the last moment Mr. Balfour was* obliged
to cancel his consent in consequence cf
the necessity of devotins all the Houses
time to the debate on supplies."
WESTERN JOCKEY CLUB
ADOPTS NEW RULES
Policy Toward Racetrack Owners
Who Refuse to Recognize Its Au
. thoritv Strongly Declared. -
CHICAGO," March 5.â The stewards of
the Western Jockey Club at a meeting
here to-day adopted the rules which will
govern the new turf body. The most Im
portant point is a declaration of policy
toward racetrack owners who refuse to
recognize the authoilty of the Western
Jockey Club. The stewards passed a- rule
barring from participation on any West
ern Jockey Club track any one racing at
unrecognized meetlncs. such as those held
by all tracks west of the Allegheny Moun
tains, except California, where a license
is not obtained -from the stewards.
The decree does not carry absolute "out
lawry" because the persons so barred are
privileged to race ?n the East or on the
Pacific Coast, but It was as far as thÂ«
Western Jockey Clut> could go under Us
present powers and shows that the stew
ards are determined to take a firm stand
to obtain the control of racing in the
West and will press their power to the
utmost.

WILLIE COOMBS, a 14-year
old boy, living with his moth

proved himself a moral de.
generate. Hia years are few.
but as he goes to a place where be will
r<ot be handled with gloves, he leaves a
black record Jn a once happy home.
Four years ago the family lived in peace
and contentment. To-day, on account of
the wayward son, the parents live apart
and a mother and two sisters weep over
the recent escapades of the young ruf
fian." Mrs. Coombs has been unable to
rrr&nage the boy for some time past, but
with a mother's love, she has always" ex
cused him and tried to induce him' to do
better. On Monday .she yielded to the en
treaties of her friends, and the boy was
committed to the care of the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society.
For several months Willie has been one
of a gang of half a dozen incorrigi
ble boys, who are absent from their homes
for days at a time and who hesitate at
nothing. On Sunday- last Willie and his
comrades went to Xorrls & Rowe's cir
cus, contrary to the commands of their
parents. Mrs. Coombs, learning where the
boy was. followed him. accompanied by
her daughter. The ladies caught him as
he was leaving the show with his com
panions. Mrs. Coombs grasped her son by
the arm and he struggled fiercely.
A gentleman, observing that the mother
and daughter were being overpowered,
steppe d in to assist. The comrades of
the boy. who up to this time had re
mained quiet, now took a hand in the fight
and two of them drew loaded revolvers
and presented them at the mother and
the daughter. The opportune arrival of a
: pdlceman prevented serious trouble. The
boy's friends fled, and Willie, awed by the
officer, went quietly home.
Monday at noon the boy wanted to go
to the circus. again, and when he was for
bidden to leave the house he procured a
brass faucet, wrapped it in a cloth, and
with this improvised slungshot attempted
to force his way to freedom. A fierce con
flict ensued. Wielding his slungshot with
one hand, he hurJed lamps, books and
other detachable articles at his mother
and sister with the other. The disturb
ance aroused the neighbors and several
ladies came in to see what was the mat
ter. They all took a hand and finally, by
sheer force of numbers, the enraged boy
! was eubdued.
A telephone message was sent to Mr.
j White of the California Society for the
I Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and the

I him down till the arrival of an officer.

searched a large quantity of morphine
and several bottles of whisky were found
in his possession. It Is no secret that
opium has been supplied to prisoners at
the jail ever since It 1 as been a Jail, but
the unusually large quantities supplied
recently aroused the suspicions of Super

About 2 o'clock yesterday morning thÂ»
furious barking of a dog attracted tha
attention of Guard Murphy and when ho
reached the point where the doc was

to the top of the fence. The interloper
had managed with th3 assistance of ths
ladder to climb to the tcp of the fence anÂ«J
then he pulled the ladder up and dropped!
It to the Inner side. He was descending
when the barking of the dog stopped him.
Murphy order.-d the man to drop, which
he did. He was taken to the officer**
quarters and searched, when the morphina
and whisky Â¦were discovered.
"When Questioned th* man said his nama
was James Wallace and he admitted thut
he had furnished opium to prisoners on
several occasions. He always operated at
night by means of tha rope ladder. After
getting into the erounds he had no ditn

BARKING OF DOG
CAUSES CAPTURE
The introductory step in the contest of
the will of the late Hyppolyte Dutard was
taken In Judge Coffey'a court yesterdav.
Mrs. Thekla Kleinclaus, decedent's els
ter, made application at the opening at
the morning session for letters of adminis
tration upon the estates of her father an1
mother, Bernard and Joaqulna Dutard.
Hyppolyte Dutard died in April, 1900.
leaving an estate valued at $3,000,000 to h'a
widow and other heirs. Mrs. Klelnclaus
now alleges that the estate left by Hyppo
lyte Dutard was not his in fact, but wa3
held by him as a trustee. She avera that
the business from which he netted hla for
tune- was founded by Bernard Dutard,
that upon hia death in iSC5 the same was
taken charge of by Hyppolyte Dutard. who
never took out letters of administration
upon his deceased parent's estate, and
that hence he simply conducted the- busi
ness as a trustee in his own and the in
terest of other heirs of Bernard Dutard
In the present action Mrs. Klelnclaus
seeks to establish a basis "upon which to
file an action for an accounting of tho
business conducted by the deceased from
the date of the death of his father up to
the time of his own demise. Mr3. Kleln
claus is represented by Knight & Heg
gerty.
The'devlsees under the will of Hyppolyte
Dutard claim Bernard Dutard's business
was worth nothing at his death and that
the success achieved by Hyppolyte IJutar.l
was due to his individual efforts and that
hence Mrs. Klelnclaus has no valid claim
to any portion of his estate." The.devisees
are represented by Attorney Charles A

and after that the whistle was blown con
tinuously. In. ten minutes after the ves
sel struck she went drwn.
Dr. A. O. O'Neill, the RIo's. surgeon,
said that he was awakened by the shock
of the rteamer going on the rocks: at -5.25
a. m. Two or three minutes Â¦ after th*
vessel struck he heard a long blast of her
whistle. This was followed by a. continu-'
ous blast, which lasted without cessation
until the steamer sank. The dast. blast
was of about four minutes' duration, from
the time he walked frcm his room, half
the length of the vessel, to his boat. Â¦Â¦.
Daniel Lane, water tender of, the Ric,
corroborated .the statements of the pre
ceding witnesses as to the blowing of tho
whistles. The last and continuous blast
was of four or five minutes' duration.
The Investigation will be resumed at 9
a. m. to-day, when the life-saving sta
tion people -will be examined. * *.
DEFENDS CAPTAIN WARD.
Witness Says He "Objected to Going
In Until . Fog Lifted. ; '
Another witness came forward yester
day to prove that Captain Ward of the ill
fated steamship Rio ;de Janeiro .was a
careful and prudent man.' "The" testimony
given Monday by Freight; Clerk George
Engelhardt at , the investigation now on
before the Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers,
to the effect that hours before the
steamer sank Captain Ward had stated
that he would- rema4n Â« outside a , week
rather than risk taking his ship through
the Gate in the dense fog. was partly cor
roborated yesterday. William Brander
Jr. a passenger who survived -the wreck,
testified that Captain i .Ward had made
practically the same assertion to him that
he made to Englehardt. .
This was the only Important testimony
brought out â¢ at the - investigation yester
day. - Pilot Jordan was a witness, but he
threw no further light. on' the subject. â¢
- Brander was the first witness called.
He told the same story of incidents be
fore and after the loss of the ship ! al
ready published. He said he had no idea
of the ship sinking or that there was any
danger. Â¦ He" testified , that his ' watch
stepped at 5:39 o'clock and had been set
by him by San Francisco time the night
before. He thought the ship sank ten
minutes after she struck. He also volun
teered that he had read the account of
the testimony given by Mr. Engelhardt
and It .reminded him of a similar conver
sation he had with the captain. When
ask od what that conversation was, Bran
der stated that' Ward said he was not go
ing in because the weather was too foggy,
but Jordan wanted to go in. Ward told
him, he said, that there would be no ad
vantage in making the attempt to go in
until : the fog lifted, but he might take
them in by daybreak. Â» :
Brander said he was asleep when the
crash came and he got out only five min
utes before the ship sank. He was saved
by a life preserver, which he adjusted Just
before the Rio went down. He also tes
tified that the whistle of the Rio blew con
tinuously while he was on deck.
Graham Coghlan,: second officer of .the
.Rio. was, .called. His testimony was
technical and nautical. He gave the in
spectors a correct account , of: the course
taken by, the ship before she struck. After
picking up the anchor, he said, the first
course was N.â NE.'by N. The deviation
of the compass was NE. At 5:19 the
course was altered one-half point to star
:beard..making.the course NE., Vfc N. This
order was almost immediately followed by
one of NE. by N.: then again starboard
one-half I point. This order was quickly
followed by an order to starboard. '.The
ship then struck.- These. orders, the.wit
ness said, were delivered within the space
of three minutes. â¢ Â¦ Coghlan said he could
not. see the quartermaster at "the wheel,
but the last named was following 'out- his
instructions â¢ as he repeated back each or
der. Coghlan. further said. that after the
first order was made the Fort Point-light
was sighted.ln the fog. Â¦ It seemed direct
ly over them when, the vessel struck. .He
said they were so close to the light that
he could see the structure of I the . light
house, even with the light in his eyes.
-. Pilot Jordan was the last witness. Be
fore he could be questioned. Attorney Mc-
Allister, who represents the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, asked to be allowed
to introduce certain papers. .His request
was denied. Inspector Bolger Informed
the pilot that he was not on trial.. but had
been simply called, as j a- witness Â¦ and he
was under the control of the State Pilot
Commissioners and was ; subject to ' their
Investigation and Judgment.
I Jordan said he tried I to Impress the of
ficers that the Rio was sinking. Hut: with
the'excentlon of Captain Ward. they. did
not think so. He said -the crew made
every effort to get the boats away, but. he
did not see many officers around.
i An adjournment was then taken until
1- o'clock to-day. Â¦ ... ./. ;.Â».â¢-.
BODY STILL XTNIDENTIFIED.

floating In the.bay. at El Campo Â¦ on Mon

of* the Rio de Janeiro disaster, are still at

most valuable aid in the search for the
lost Rio. and yesterday afternoon he sug
gested that the drag rope be again used,
and If it caught in the wreck of the ves
sel, that a dlvor be sent down on an an
chor to a aepth of, fifteen fathoms right
over the spot. The draK rope was put out
as in the morning, but the ebb tide was
too strong for successfrl work.
The launches were obliged to work out
of the current rnd in doing so one of the
propellers of a launch was caught In the
drag rope. J. Seko, one of the Japanese,
went down without a diving suit- in order
to cut the rope which had wound around
the propeller, and he remained under water
for Intervals of two minutes. Finally
Watanabe, the diver who had gone down
during the. day at Fort Point, donned ills
suit and- in a few minutes had the ob
struction on the propeller cleared away.
In the afternoon, when the divers were
busy, hundreds of people lined Bakers
Beach and the shore bluffs and watched
the Interesting work of those searching
for the bones of the lost ship.
RIO'S DISTKESS WHISTLES.
Witnesses Testify They Were Sounded
After Vessel Struck.
Major Thomas J. Blakeney, superin
tendent of the Twelfth Life Saving Dis
trict, resumed his investigation- at 9:20
o'clock yesterday morning into the al
leged misconduct and inefficiency, of the
members of. the life saving stations from
Fort Point to Bakers Beach on the occa
sion of the wreck of the Rio de Janeiro
on the morning of February 22. Pilot
Frederick Jordan, C. J. Holland, third
officer; H. Donohue. steerage steward,
and Dr. Artuhr O. O'Neill, the ship's sur
geon, were the witnesses examined. All
swore positively that Â¦when the' Rio
struck on the rocks the whistles blew
three or four short blasts, followed by a
blast that lasted until the ship -went
down, a period of time variously estimat
ed by the witnesses as ranging from three
to five minutes. 'The witnesses agreed
also In saying that the whistles of the
Rio were more than ordinarily. loud and
strong.
In eliciting these two material facts
Major Blakeney proved that proper sig
nals of distress were made by the Rio.
and that those signals were unheeded and
Ignored by the members of the life sav
ing station.
Pilot Jordan retold the old story of the
wreck, and his experience.
Major Blakeney was very searching in
his crops-examination and proDed Into
the matter of the divided responsibility
for the loss of life In the wreck.
The witness asseverated that the -pilot
does not supersede the captain. He is
an assistant of the captain in the navi
gation of the vessel. He is employed
because of his local knowledge. Jordan
did not know at the time of the wreck
that a freshet was running out Â¦ of the
rivers emptying Into the bay, but he
learned of that fact later.
"Do you consider - it perfectly safe to
bring In a vessel In a fog as dense as
that of the morning of the wreck of the
Rio de Janeiro?" asked Major Blakehey.
"Yes,' sir, it Is safe. I have .- done - so
hundreds of times, but K is never per
fectly safe to run In a fop even in the
open sea. I had no thought of running
upon a rock or on the land; the only dan
ger would be oi a collision with other
boats or. fishing smacks going out on the
ebb tide."
"Was it not the Instruction of. the Pa
cific Mall Steamship Company not to
bring In vessels In a fog?" â¢ .
"Not to me. I knew that such Instruc
tions had been Issued to the captains,
however."
C. J. Holland, third officer of the Rio.
described how the danger signals were
given on the occasion of the wreck: Im
mediately after the vessel struck, a blast
was blown on the whistle continuously
for twenty-five or thirty seconds. Â¦ Then
two short blast* were blown as the signal
to abandon the ship. 'After â¢ that the
whistles were blown continuously until
the ship went down. The witness, ad
mitted that he did not understand what
the International danger signal > was, and
added that when he received. his license
he was examined as to his knowledge of
the rules of the road, but not as to his
The location was at once noticed in the
chart, and It was found that the two
launches' and the line of the drag rope
were in a radius where the water was
from twenty-nine to forty-three fathoms
in depth. The spot was just a mile from
Point Diablo and about one and an eighth
mile from Fort Point.
In about ten minutes the taut line be
came slack again and the launches came
together. It being hoped that a diver
could go down at the spot where the rope
caught.
At 'this time the tide was about to
change and suddenly, from below the
surface of the water, a large piece of
wreckage came to the surface. It waa
about six feet long and two feet wide
and was ttalnted a dark green color.
The seats and ventilators of the Rio were
of this color and the wreckage was
thought to be part of her deck construc
tion. One of the launches went after the
wreckage and took It aboard. The gen
eral decision of the Japanese divers and
all on board the launches was that the
drag rope had caught In the top masts
of the Rio. That the ship was at the
spot where the rope caught was verified,
so they believe, when the wreckage came
to the surface.
Caught in Deep Water.
It was absolutely Impossible for the
twenty-one fathom depth of the rope to
have caught in anything but the top
masts of the Rio in depths of water run
ning from thirty to forty, fathoms. At
these depths the drag rope and its at
tached weights would. It is believed, have
floated clear of any other obstruction.
When the tide changed the drag rope
was hauled in and the divers proceeded
to a spot just off Fort Point. It was
thought that some bodies of the passen
gers or crew of the Rio might be wedged
in the rocks there, and a diver went down
to make a search. The ebb tide was too
strong to allow the. man to remain below
and he was forced to come to the surface.
K. I. Okada. editor of the San Francisco
Journal, a Japanese publication, has lent
For mor* than an hour the launches
and careful watch was kept on
t'-e boating keg? and the ropes running
fr<".rn the anchor bits of the launches. Not
a s ; gn wap developed to chow that the
rtmjr rop<? had caught until the launch
en the Marin side of the Golden Gate was
almost up to Point Diablo. The other
!aur.<-h at that time was fullv a third of
a mile away and the lire of floating kegs
wraa drawn out In a Flight Â«=eml-circle.
Suddenly the launch on the Marin County
Fide of the Golden Gate was almost
drawn under water by the tightening of
the line of the drag rope fastened to her
bits. The launch was drawn on her side
and it was l>ar<*<1 that at any second the
rop*> would orr>ak. The position of the
!?unch was r.mirod by these in the other
irrar.ch and at the same time the line of
krtrF was noticed to lie drawn taut.

cf thnre !t held wa? abandoned by the
company last Saturday. !\*ot a sounding
J^a*! hasÂ» been dropped since Saturday by
er<y person acting under instructions from
the Pacific Mall Company.
Since Friday the Japanese divers and
representatives of The Call have worked
to locate the hull of the wrecked steam
ship. Forty-two descents were made by
the divers on Saturday and Sunday, the
men staying: below water from three mln
utcF to three-quarters of an hour In
depths of water ranging from nine to
twenty-four fathoms.
A novel plan of dragging for the wTeck
was 'j?ed yesterday and in less than two
hours the frraveyard of the Rio de Ja
neiro, it is believed, was definitely located.
Early yesterday morning when the flood
tide was running into the bay two gaso
line launches proceeded with the divers
and representatives cl The Call to Mil*
Rocks. One of the launches had the big
fishing boat the divers used on Sunday in
tow.
Apparatus Was Simple.
The drapprins apparatus was pimple, yet
mofi <-!T>ctlve. It c-nsisted of 1800 feet
<{ half-inch rope, well shrunk, to which
heps were attached at regular Intervals
to sustain the rope in the water.
The lines running tu-m the ISOO-foot rope
Â¦to the kegs were from sixteen to twenty
ore fathoms in lengtn and at the end of
each supporting line, where it was
fastened to the rope, was another fathom
line carrying a ten-pound weijrht.
When the launches reached Mile Rock
the drag rope and kegs were thrown
overboard and the launches spread out
at the ar.gles of a V.
One launch proceeded from Mile Rock
In a ptraljrht line toward Point Bonita
while the other launch drifted in the flood
tide into the cove of Bakers Beach.
I- ten minutes the novel sight of the
gigantic drag spread out over a distance
<-f nearly a third of a mile was witnessed.
The idea was used most successfully in
Japan in locating a sunken vessel In the
Inland Sea and the div&rs had every
faith in the arrangement.
If. in <JrapRinÂ£T in a depth of from six
teen to twenty-one fathoms, the line
caught, the divers were sure that the ob
struction would be the wreck of the Rio
de Janeiro and that they would be able
to reach it in their living apparatus, if
The drag rope caught In a depth of more
than twenty-one fathoms It would prove,
they said, that the rope had caught in
the rigging or masts of the ship.
' Slowly, on the flood tide, the two
launches with the drag rope suspended
between them swept a wide stretch of
the Golden Gate. The operations were
â¢watched with Interest from the shore and
raising phips and the captains of two
vc?s=els which passotl in changed their
course <n order not to interfere with the
cperations.
