The review of the school children to
morrow depends entirely on the state of
Mrs. McKinley's health. The President
will make no arrangements until the last
possible moment.
No arrangements have yet been made
for a review of the troops at the Presidio
to-day by the President, but It is thought
that if Mrs. McKinley's condition allows,
the chief executive will inspect the garri
son.
During the day the President received
messages from the King and Queen of
Great Britain and from the President of
France, conveying sincere sympathy and
heartfelt hope? for the recovery of Mrs.
McKinley. The President dictated re
plies to the messages and instructed Sec
retary Cortelyou to 1 forward the latest
bulletins as to the health of the patient.
The chief executive remained with his
secretary and a few friends until 10:30
p. m., and after visiting his wife, retired
for the , night.
The President dined with his secretary
and eagerly awaited the arrival of the
physicians. The cheering decision of the
doctors as to the condition of their pa
tient brought a look of relief to the face
of the President and he accompanied the
physicians to the door of the house when
they took their departure.
ally word was sent from the house at
5:30 p. m. that the President would not
again leave the house. (

MANY ARE DISAPPOINTED.
Great Crowd Waits Vainly Around
the Central Methodist Church.
Great disappointment was felt by the
multitude which thronged Central Meth
odist Church and its near vicinity yester
day morning Â¦when it was learned that
President McKinley would not be able to
attend the service, as he had planned.
Long before the service was to commence
the building was crowded with people
anxious to get a glimpse of the President,
and those who were not able to enter
gathered around the church in' hundreds.
j Chief of Police Sullivan was on hand
with a large squad of police, ajid the
crowd was kept in good order. It was
only at the last minute that it was known
that the President would be absent on ac
count of Mrs. McKinley's condition.

and purity of this -conception.
Chief Executive Only Leaves the
Souse for a Short Walk.
Yesterday was a quiet day in the tem
porary home of the President at Clay and
Lagruna streets.
fit was thought that the President would
attend church in the morning and a large
crowd gathered in the park opposite the
Scott residence in the hope of seeing the
chief executive drive from the house. The
sightseers were doomed to disappoint
ment, however, but later on the President
took a short walk, accompanied by Secre
tary Cortelyeu.
The President was in a happy frame of
mind, and showed by his manner that the
severe strain caused by his .wife's Illness
h&d ceased. He pave a most cordial greet
ing to the police officers and detectives in
front of the house and saluted the news
paper: representatives as he started to
walk in the park.
Hundreds of men, women and children
were kept at a distance by the police of
ficers, and no one was allowed to disturb
the President as he enjoyed his stroll.
Again the head of the nation displayed his
Intense love for children. While he waved
his hat to the adults in the distance, he
beckoned the children to him and gave
each little one a cordial hand grasp and
made Inquiries as to their names and age.
The President proceeded at a brisk pace
along the streets in the vicinity of his
temporary home and returned to the
house ten minutes after leaving It.
During the day many carriages drove up
to the Scott residence. The President re
ceived the members of his Cabinet, and
among the callers were General Shafter.
Assistant Postmaster McKinley, uncle of
the President, a delegation of residents
from Canton, Ohio, and Calvin P. Titus,

had dropped into a sound slumber and
there was every indication that the im

Although statements have been' made
that certain persons" have had access to
the sick room during the past week, it
was learned on positive authority last
evening that no one has been allowed to
enter the room of Mrs. McKinley except
the President, the physicians, the nurses
and a minister who called at the Scott
residence on Thursday. No other visitors
to the house, whether relatives or friends
of the President and his wife, have been
allowed to aDnroach the room where the
lady of the White House has battled with

IT has been definitely decided that
the officers of the Cabinet who ac
companied the President to this
coast from "Washington, with tho ex

main with him until he returns.
At first the question of the fu

as to the length of time the President
would be detained at the bedside of his
wife. None of his official family wished
to leave him, and all are growing anx
ious over the work that must be piling up
In their offices; but the matter has been
settled by the personal request of- the
President that the Secretaries remain
with him and return to "Washington as
members of his party.
This action was decided upon because
of the returning health of Mrs. McKin
ley. If she continues to Improve in the
next few days as she has since Friday
last it will not be long before the party
can come together again and proceed &s
it did before, except that it will return
by the most direct route to "Washington.
Secretary Long left for the East yester

v It was amid surroundings such as these that
Jefferson elaborated â¢ a political syÂ«tem which
was the antithesis of all that had been there
tofore taught or practiced. .The whole of that
system rested upon the principle enunciated
In the Declaration of Independence as the first
of the self-evident truths which the. Colonies
proclaimed to the world as a Justification for
the severance of the political bands which conr
nected them with Great Britain. From - this
one central truth, as streams, from a common
fountain head, all others flowed. Of this main
proposition all others were corollaries. From
this all-essential principle all othersâ that the
people have the right to govern themselves as
they will â¢ that governments derive their
power from the consent of the governed; that
Tiublic institutions exist to secure equal rights
and Justice to all and specia 1 exemptions c.
privileges to- none; that life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness are rights Inherent in
man and inseparable from his being â are de
rived. That vital principle, Â¦ that alNpermeat
ing truth, that everlasting foundation of all
democracy is found in the single but sublime
words of the Declaration of Independence that
all men are created equal. "
In the Â¦ years which . preceded the American
revolution, Jefferson not only proclaimed this
truth as a fundamental verity In the science
of government, but from that time on vindi
cated It with all the ability of his great mind,
espoused it with the ardor and sincerity of his
exalted soul, and during the whole of his pub
lic life improved every opportunity to put _ it
into practice. , He believed that the will of the
people was the supreme lavr, and their welfare
the only legitimate goal of government. His
ears were ever open to catch the sound of
their complaints, his heart responsive to their
sufferings,, his brain active in -devising and
his hand prompt In executing 'schemes for the
amelioration of their condition. " Upon no sub
ject was he more solicitous than upon Â¦ the
general diffusion of education and .useful
knowledge, holding that "the basis of our
Government being the opinion of the People,
the very first object should be to keep that
rl His belief In the Â¦Individual liberty of every
human being: waa a conviction Interwoven into
the very textures of his soul. Upon this sub
ject he recognized no flimsy distinction of race
or color. The hereditary bondmen of the plan
tation enlisted his sympathy, and was the ob
ject of his efforts In the cause of human free
dom He strove for the abolition of slavery,
predicting its baneful Influence and with
prophetic. voice warning his countrymen that

book of fatÂ« than that these people were to be
free." :' .'Â¦Â¦ ' ' ' Â¦ . /' .

sion of his sovereign favor. His attribute was
command; his subjects' duty, obedience. Be
yond that whatever functions might be exer*
cised by those he ruled were privileges ac

Marna Charta Itself. Witness the language
of royal charters conferred upon English mu

Witness the writs granting burroughs the right
to return members to Parliament. Witness
the compendious and essentially true exclama
tion of Louis XIV: "The state? I am the
state." Â¦ .
\ It was natural that under such a rule, mo
narchical Institutions should find In the com
munity devoted supporters. To maintain and
perpetuate his power It was unavoidable that
the sovereign should delegate a certain part
of his authority, . accompanied with corre
sponding honors and distinctive privileges, to
a sslect olass. Such a class, by becoming par
ticipators In its power, naturally became the
supporters of the throne and constituted a
barrier, against popular encroachment upon Its
authority. To attach the members of this
class to their dynasty had been, at some pe
riod of their existence, the policy of all Kuro
pean monarchs. It was none the less so with
England. Distinguished from the mass of the
people by large grants of land, titles of no
bility, special privileges and the enjoyment of
state offices, such a class constituted an aris
tocracy interested above all things in resisting
the aspirations of the masses toward the
equalization of stations. >. . .

Bâ^ ENICIA, May 19.â The Democracy
of California celebrated to-day in
the old State capital the seml-
centennial of the formation of
the Democratic party in Califor
nia. The historic meeting place was in
spiring, the audience was imbued with the
spirit of the occasion, the day was pro
pitious and the speeches were eloquent â
that is to eay, there were eloquent
speeches.
In addition to a large delegation from
: San Francisco's center of Democracy, the
Iroquois Club, there were large repre
sentations present from Martinez and
Stockton, from which the river steamer
I Captain Weber was run, and from Sacra
mento and Vallejo. The main hall of the
old Capitol was filled to its utmost capac
ity for the afternoon exercises.
.The celebration was held under the
auspices of the State League of Demo
cratic and Iroquois Clubs, and to-mor
row, beginning at 10 o'clock In the morn
ing, the annual conference of the league
will be held. It is hoped by the leaders of
the faithful to infuse life into the skeleton
organization at this meeting and make the
league a center of influence and organiza
tion that will work the rehabilitation of
the party in this State. A local Iroquois
Club probably will be organized to-mor
row, and the hope is that the annual con
ference will result in the institution of an
i aggressive campaign of organization
throughout the State. * Â¦
I There Is but little interest In the choice
! of officers for the League. A. A. Bailey
: of Martinez is spoken of for grand sachem
' and the choice will probably rest upon
i him unless some San Francisco, man be
comes ambitious.
Voyage of the San Franciscans.
The San Francisco delegation made the
] trip to the revered camping ground on the
steamer Onisba. Long: before f 9 o'clock,
the hour set for the steamer's departure
from Jackson-street wharf, the delegates
began to gather on the wharf and a band
played stirring tunes for their entertain
ment. Presently all was ready and the
master of the steamer picked out a time
when the city of Stockton was passing
close by the end of the pier and backed
into her. The Onisba was swung vio
lently sidewise and for a moment the pas
sengers thought, a catastrophe was im
pending. A rush for the sides was made,
but when the situation was understood
all excitement subsided. The City of
Stockton's engines were reversed and the
vessel backed out of the way of the
aggressive back-action excursion steamer.
Many women and .children made the
round trip on the Onisba, and the greater
number of the several hundred members
of the San Francisco Iroquois Club who
made the trip returned on the Onisba,
leaving Benicia at 5:30 p. m., the delegates
to the conference and a few others only
remaining for the proceedings of the sec
ond day. -- . .
The voyage up the bay was a three
hours' delightful outing for the braves
from the city. The morning was bright
end warm. A pleasant breeze blew over
the bay, scarcely causing a ripple on the
surface. ' _
The best known men of the San Fran
cisco Democracy were among the passen
gers. All of the Democratic office-holders
practically except Mayor Phelan were, on
board. Coroner Leland, Registrar Walsh,
Recorder, Godchaux, Judge Cabaniss, Su
pervisor Booth and Public Administrator
Boland were in the center of the thickest
groups of braves.
Prominent Men in Attendance.
D. M. Delmas, whose eloquence Â¦ was to
ring clear and reverberating among, the
rafters of the old State Capitol, was a
passenger on the excursion boat. Barclay
Henley was aboard. In him the genera
tion of fifty years ago found its most
authoritative spokesman for the day, for
hia father, Thomas J. Henley, was chair
man of that- first Democratic State Con
vention, the semi-centennial of which was
celebrated to-day.
Senator J. C. Sims, Max Popper and
Thomas E. Curran were with the excur
sionists. In addition to Popper the fol
lowing past sachems, who are delegates
to the conference to-morrow, were on
board: Charles Gildea. A. D. Lemon, L.
Metzger, William McMann, District At
torney L. F. Byington, L. -V. Merle and
T. J. Walsh. The other San Francisco
delegates, most of whom were on the
Onisba. are W. H. Kline. J. C. Gorman,
H. L. Blenfleld. Walter Gallagher, W. A.
Asmussen, William Cubery. Joseph Roths
child, E. T. Mlnnehan, C. H. Holcomb,
Robert Day and C. F, Kimball. â¢
Benicia was reached at a few minutes
past 12 o'clock. The citizens were wait
ing to welcome the visitors. The celeb
rities of the San Francisco delegation
were shown to carriages and the guests
were escorted along First street in a par-

Mr. President and Gentlemen: Tha present
hour Is reminiscent of three epochs, to which
the proprieties and duties attendant upon this
occasion V. forcefully direct our attention. A
century and a quarter separates us from the
first, a century from the second and half a
century from the last of these epochs. . Fifty
years ago, the Democracy of California, assem
bled within these walls, held here Its. first con
vention. One hundred years ago, the . first
Democratic Â¦ President was Inaugurated at
Washington. One hundred and' twenty-five
years ago, this very month â almost this very
day â Thomas Jefferson, returning from Vir
ginia, resumed his seat in the Congress at
Philadelphia, there to draft that declaration
which constitutes not. only the title-deed of
American national existence, but is also the
first authoritative proclamation of that politi
cal faith of which he was . at once the founder
and archetype. As each of these epochs sig
nalized either a notable event or ,Â«, great
achievement in the history Of ' our- party, it
may not be Inappropriate to ask what Im
press ehall the present age leave, upon, the
annals of Democracy? .
.Barclay Henley was introduced as the
son of his father, tiie man who presided
over that first Stato convention of fifty
years ago. He spokex at some length of
the Issues of that campaign of half a
century ago and finally reached William
Jennings Bryan, at whose name enthusi
astic applause was given.-
V The Eloquence of Delmas.
D. M. . Delmas, the orator of the day,
was received witn prolonged applause.
The audience had become restive during
the hot afternoon, DUt quiej was soon re
stored under the influence of his magnetic
speech, until 'toward - the close of his ad
dress the audience iistened with breath
less attention, moving only to break Into
tumultuous applause at intervals. He
said: J
â¢ D. B. Brown of Stanislaus County, an
other man who voted- the Democratic
ticket in 1851, was called to the platform
and given his share of generous applause.
Mr. Cannon spoke of the historic events
which had occurred In- the old Capitol. He
said he had even heard that an honest
Legislature once met in it. He predicted
that if the Democrats of the State would
organize and work in harmony- the next
convention would inaugurate a long series
of Democratic victories, even as did the
convention of fifty years ago.
C. P. Stevens; ".representing Mayor
Crooks, delivered an address of welcome.
Mr. Stevens is an ardent Republican, but
he voiced a hearty ta- el come to Benicia' s
guests. He declared that the Democratic
party had had an honorable part In the
progress. of California, and said such was
true largely because . of the organization
of Iroquols clubs founded upon true Jef
fersonian principles. -v^^
William M. Cannon, president or the San
Francisco Iroquoia Club, spoke in re
sponse. He said It was the first time he
had ever heard a good Republican make a
good Democratic speech. He related the
story of Benlcla's old grudge against San
Francisco because the name of the pres
ent metropolis was stolen from the town
now known as Benicia, and expressed
pleasure that the grudge had been forgot
ten and the welcome extended the guests
had been so warm,
Judge Cabaniss, grand sachem of the
State League of Iroquois Clubs, called the
meeting 1 to order at 2:40 p. m. and spoke
briefly regarding: the occasion of celebra
tion. He explained that two venerable
men were present, one of whom; Richard
Winn of San Francisco, late of San Joa
quin County, was a delegate to the con
vention of fifty years ago, and the other,
Dr. E. L. Rose of Benicia, voted the
straight ticket as nominated at that time.
He appointed Messrs. Gildea and Gorman
to escort them to the platform, where
they were introduced and received with
great applause.,. ;

after which there marched the volunteer
firemen, red-shirted .and tuck-trousered,
and the exempt firemen. Salutes were
fired from anvils on the cross streets and
most of the population watched the par
ade from the sidewalks. The grand mar
shal, Joseph Johnston, . led the line
march up First street, past the historic
old State Capitol, and the back to it,
whefle- the column was dismissed and the
residents took charge of their guests un
til the hour set for the exercises.
In order adequately to understand ' themâ in
order to appreciate the character Â¦ and the ex
tent of the changes which they brought about

world during: a brief period before he started

and functions of the ruler of a nation ud to

this purpose it will : not , be necessary, - and
would not. be profitable, to extend â¢ the Inquiry

The public life of Thomas' Jefferson - lasted
over forty years. For two terms he filled the
most exalted office in the land. â¢ By his pub
lic life and recorded utterances: he has afforded
history the amplest opportunity of determining
his; political principles. What, then, were
those principles?, â¢ Â¦ . . 'Â¦ -
Jeffersonian Principles.
Mr. President, all^ religious creeds, all sys
tems of philosophy^ all political parties rest; in
their ultimate expression upon some .single
basic Idea. This idea may manifest itself with
endless modifications. But, when all adjuncts
are brushed away, the, essential ultimate prin
ciple will always be found unchanged amid
the variety of its Â¦ applications. What, ' then,
is the basic Idea of. Jeffersonlan Democracy?,
What; the object to which the political , phil
osophy of Jefferson, with a constancy as un
changeable as that of the needle to the pole,
ever points as its goal? What the- touchstone
by which the purity of all doctrines claiming
kinship with , that philosophy may. In their
last analysis, be determined? ry
For the making of such an examination no
time could be more propitious than the day
on which we are met to commemorate the
foundation of the Democratic party in _ this
State, and no place more fitting. than the hall
in which its first convention was assembled.
Let us, then, now and here, enter Into a brief
and dispassionate examination of the doctrines
which Jefferson taught, resolved to pledge them
our allegiance anew â returning to the fold. If
we have unconsciously wandered, and strength
ened and confirmed In our devotion If no
hersey has yet marred our faith. ,
Tenets of^the Democracy.
Shall the mlssion~"of the Democratic party
be performed by an abandonment of its tenets,
or shall it rather be accomplished by a faith
ful observance of the time-honored principles
of old?. The question is proper to be asked at
this time, when we are every day told by
self-styled reorganizes, that the Democratic
party owes its defeat to its assertion of the
faith of j Jefferson and are solicited by self
constituted harmonizers to return to the prin
ciples of Jeffersonlan Democracy. However
doubtful the quarter from which this warn
ing issues, however suspicious the source from
which this exhortation emanates, : it : behooves
Us to examine it. We cannot, as prudent men,
disregard it. If, after .a long voyage upon
a tempestuous ocean, a chip. should be hailed
Â¦ by a passing" craft, and; 1 ' upon - signaling the
port for which Â¦ it - was bound, should -receive
in reply â¢ a warning that it had drifted from
Its course and was sailing in the wrong > direc
tion, the prudent mariner would - at once net
about putting to the proof this disturbing in
telligence. However strange the build of the
hulk or piratical the appearance of the sig
nal, he would examine . into his charts, | take
fresh observations of the sun, and: determine
by every means in his power whether he was
in truth wrong in his bearings. So,' when the
Democracy of to-day is told tha.t it has de
parted from its principles and Is exhorted to
return to the orthodox tenets of Us founder,
If becomes its dutyâ however strong may be
its suspicions that the language | is that of
ill-disguised ' traitors^-carefully to test the
truth of the indictment and determine . the
value of the exhortation.
And will he then record that the Democratic
party, acknowledging that its defeat was ir
retrievable, . embraced the tenets of Its adver
saries, abandoned its organization, and, like
the Whigs of former days, ceased as a party
to exist? Or will he record that, In this
year, standing upon the threshold of a new
century and gazing with eyes undaunted by
temporary disaster into the realms of futur
ity, it gathered its scattered battalions once
more together and. elrding its loins to the
task of stemming the invading tide of imperial-
Ism, rescued the nation from the downward
course In which the Republican party â had
plunged it, and restored the American people
to the true path of Its glorious destiny? ! Which
of these shall be the record? If we say the
latter. It Is proper to inquire by what means
this result is to be best accomplished.

jver to the foe, and the still more dangerous

sional mistakes of associates. He knew that
imperfection was ' the unshunable trait of all
human institutions. He trusted to time, re
flection . and experience to correct these pass-
Ing errors. Not his the wisdom of the paltry
politician or petty time server, who shifts with
every turn of the breeze and turns his sail to
catch every breath of favor. The edifice he
built was bullded for all time. It was destined
to last forever. It was based, he knew upon
principles hewn from the quarries of eternal
truth. Temporary disasters could not daunt
him. He waited in patience for the right to
triumph. His courage was equal to his pa
tience. No religious enthusiast â¢ could have
been more secure of ultimate triumph than he ;
for, as remarked by one of his biographers,
"his faith In Democracy stood to him In the
place of religion; he preached it with a fervor
intensity and constancy worthy of a Mahomet
or a Wesley."
Reforms in Virginia.
The great work of Jefferson's practical en
forcement of his convictions, begun in the
House of Delegates of Virginia, continued In
the Continental Congress, persevered In during
missions abroad and while holding office at
home under the administrations of Washington
and of Adams, found its culmination in his ad
ministration of the office of chief magistrate
of the republic. While it would ' be idle to
attempt even the most compendious review of
his uolitlcal life I hope you will pardon the
tax upon your attention If, for a moment, I
briefly refer to some of his public, acts as il
lustrations especially applicable to present con
ditions of what he understood the principles
of Democracy In their practical application to
mean.
Soon after the drafting of the Declaration
of Independence he returned to Virginia for
the purpose of taking his part in the establish
ment of- the newly created government of that
commonwealth. He entered the House of DeN
egates on October 7, 177& Standing In direct
antagonism to the Â¦ principle of equality ' he
found many institutions of that ancient colony.
Prominent among these was the law which
permitted -the perpetuation - of . the ownership
or lands and slaves -within a family by trans
mitting them by entail from generation to
generation.' Thus, was the aristocracy of-Vir
ginia enabled, like its English prototype, to
establish itself - as a distinct and privileged
class. Another violation of that principle he
found In those laws of primogeniture by which
the -oldest son inherited, to the exclusion of
his brothers and sisters, all the lands and
slaves of his father.- Still another was the
established church, which, patterned upon the
English fashion, was supported by enforced
contributions from dissenters, who were denied
participation in any of the benefits which "it
might confer.
There were other abuses, but these will
suffice for the purpose of Illustration. All of
them he considered based' upon class distinc
tions, tending, to use his own words, to per
petuate "an aristocracy of wealth of more
barm and danger than benefit to society." 1
All these badges of special privilege, all these
violations of equality he struck at with the
vigor of earnest conviction, and paused not
until he had leveled them to the ground. To
him Virginia owes those laws which established
religious freedom within her borders, abolished
the feudal practice of primogeniture and en
tails and placed the education of her Inhab
itants â the foundation of all true Democracy â
upon a broad and universal basis. -- â¢
I have thus, Mr. President, endeavored to
state as I understand them the essential and
fundamental principles of Jeffersonlan Democ
racy and to give a few examples of their en
forcement. And. I repeat It. the basic Idea
of these principles and the lode star of the
public life of their Illustrious, author is the
equality of all created men.
Need of True Democracy.
"We have been told that we have wandered of
late from Jeffersonlan Democracy. Sir, I ques
tion both the truth and the sincerity of the
accusation: But upon this subject I will not
pause to debate. Our concern Is with the
present and the future â not the past. If we
have erred let us hasten to Correct our' wan
derings and return to the true path.: If our
faith has been marred- by heresy let us seek
a new baptism of faith.
Â¦ Never, sir, did the nation stand In greater
need than now of the salutary doctrines of
Jefferson. By what principle -will you check
the mad career of concentration and monopoly
which now threatens to subvert our institu
tions, destroy individual liberty and transform
our Government Into " a mere sordid money
makingr oligarchy? By what principle -will you
keep within the limits of moderation and Jus
tice the clamors of ; that united labor, whose
form, now looming up above the horizon, as
sumes to-day such amazing and portentous
proportions? By what conjuration 'or mighty
magic will you still the mutterings of that
tempest whose black and threatening - clouds
now cast their baleful shadow over the land?
By what principle, I ask, unless it bÂ» that
of the Democracy of Jefferson, of the Democ- 1
racy of the Declaration of Independence, of
the Democracy of nature herself â the prin
ciple by which the pride of the arrogant shall
be humbled and the humility of the lowly shall
be lifted upâ the >>principle of the universal
equality of man?
Let us then, fellow Democrats, renew our
fealty to the ancient tenets of our faith." Let
us engrave them upon our hearts. > Let us use
them as rallying cries in battle. Let us blazon
them In letters of light upon our banners. , Let
us. above all, emulate the patience of our great
teacher and the Â¦ sublime confidence which
taught him to await the ultimate triumph of
truth, the enduring victory of Justice.'

The, hot weather of the early part of
last week melted the snow very rapidly
in the mountains. This was followed by
thirty hours of 6teady rain, with the re
sult that the district is practically afloat.

it Is now six feet higher than was ever
known before. All the wharves along the

The Cottonwood River became a torrent
yesterday morning. Three houses, two oc
cupied by gardeners and the third by one
of the officials of the Hall Mines smelter,
were swept down the gulch and into the
lake. In one R. Bloomfield was cooking
n steak for breakfast when a tidal wave
struck the side of the house. The occu
pant escaped with his life, and before a
minute had passed the house was carried
a quarter of a mile down the hill by the j
torrent. I
The principal damage was on the Nelson
and Fort Shephard line. Three buildings
were swept out, and damage was done to |
the track in many places. The flood had
been expected for the last ten days, and
as a consequence every arrangement was
made to secure conditions against loss of
life. Half a dozen other buildings have
been declared unsafe by the city author
ities and closed, so that all traffic is at a
standstill. This evening Nelson Is threat
ened with darkness, for both the electric
light and gas works are in immediate dan- ;
ger of being swept away. Temporary
dams are being constructed along the
river, and they may be saved in this way.
Yesterday afternoon the Canadian Pa
cific depot station buildings and yards
were threatened with overflow. The flood
broke through a temporary barricade and
an extra rush came down the mountain
tide. It looked as if the whole lower sec- j
tlon of the town would soon be over
whelmed, but a large number of citizens
immediately hurried to the scene and re
placed the temporary dam. The water
was still rising at last accounts.

There is a story of great historical in
terest in connection with the grant. Dur
ing the rebellion of General Sam Houston
against Mexico Greenberry Dorsey, father
of Samuel P. Dorsey, was Collector of tha
! Port at New Orleans and also a wealthy
: merchant in that city, as well as tha
owner of plantations in Cuba and numer
ous fast sailing schooners which were the
forerunners of the clipper ships of more
recent years. '
Greenberry Dorsey rendered financial aid
to General Houston, sending him supplies
without limit in his struggle for the inde
, pendence of Texas, and It Is a part of tnÂ«
family tradition that It was with the se
cret consent of the American Government.
For this generosity, which was wholly
gratuitous so far as the thoughts of the
elder Dorsey were concerned, the State oÂ£
Texas afterward granted him the lands.
Since that time no leas than forty al
leged heirs of Greenberry Dorsey nava
laid claim to the lands and have taken
possession and removed the timber for
which the lands were once quite valuable.
But Samuel P. Dorsey says he is the one
true heir and son of Greenberry Dorsey
and declares he has abundant proof.
Samuel P. Dorsey came to Grass Valley
in the early mining days. He Is the Prin
cipal owner and superintendent of tna
famous Maryland mine. He has been the
Grass Valley agent for the Wells-Fargo
Express Company since April 1, isa<- **Â«
Is now seventy-five years of age.
Greenberry Dorsey, the father, owned a
schooner that ran the British blockade of
Chesapeake Bay in the war of 1813 and
displayed her heels to all pursuers, escap
ing to the "West Indies for succor for the
American soldiers, which was secured and
landed at New Orleans in due time, Dor
sey fought In the battle of New Orleans
when General Packenham fell with a mor
tal â¢wound and his army was defeated by
the Invincible riflemen from Kentucky and
Tennessee under the command of General
Andrew Jackson.
GRASS VALLEY, May ID.â Samuel P.
Dorsey, an express agent and mining su
perintendent cf this city, has Just been
notified by a brother-in-law who lives In
Texas that a large grant of land of which
he is the principal heir is situated in tha
heart of the oil district. Within ten
miles is a well from which there la a dally
flow of 76,000 barrels. The land consists of
tracts of 320 acres each and there are 5000
acres in all. It is in Hardin County and

LONDON, May 19.â Only now are peopler
at Windsor and the royal retainers begin
ning 'to realize what the death of Queen
Victoria meant to them. Sweeping changes
were- inaugurated this week in the royal
establishments. The older servants are
being pensioned. Frazer, the late Queen's
police- superintendent, "almost as familiar
a figure as the Queen herself on public
occasions, goes" into retirement, and head
keepers and gardeners disappear into, the
obscurity of the pension list.
The King is putting his house into'order
with ' a vengeance. â¢ The Prince Consort's
rooms, -which had been closed for many
years by Queen ' Victoria's order and
which were kept as thqy were at the, time
of his death; have been opened and refur
nished in modern* style, and the state
apartments have . been transformed into
-rooms where the 'members of the royal
family can live in comfort. . The jubilee
presents and many favorite pictures of
Queen Victoria have been sent to London,
and the Queen's personal belongings have
been distributed among the members of
"her family. ,. Even her dogs have not es
caped the. new order. The smooth-coated
collies, .which were her special favorites,
have been distributed among the people
of 'Windsor, and the other collies, dachs
hunds and t Pomeranians, about seventy
in all, have', been claimed by various
Princesses, for King Edward and Queen
Alexandra care little for anything but ter
riers and pugs. Â¦
; Next month 5000 dozens'* of costly wine
from the late Queen's cellars ' will be sold
at public auction in -London. \ Each bottle
will have the rbyal label on\lt. Various
reasons are given for this almost unpre
cedented action.. The most probable con
sists in the fact that royal hospitality is
now generally confined to whisky â¢ and
soda and champagne, and to the lapse of
the practice by which court functionaries
formerly ; received daily a bottle of Ma
deira or port as pfcrt of their salaries. -
iAll these things come as a shock to the
people, -who had: almost grown to believe
that Queen Victoria '.would live forever." "-

EDWARD MAKES
MANY CHANGES
PHILADELPHIA, May 19.â Visiting del
egates to the Presbyterian general assem
bly to-day filled the pulpits of Philadel
phia and Camden, N. J.. churches. The
Mecca of most of the lay* commissioners
was Calvary Church, where the assembly
is Eitting and where the moderate/, Rev.
Dr. Henry C. Minton of California,
preached his first sermon as the presiding
officer of the assembly. Dr. Minton took
for his subject the parable of Christ re
storing eight to a blind man, emphasizing
that the miracle was effected gradually
Said he: .
"We are born blind, for a cataract of
sin covers our eyes. Multitudes have re
ceived the first touch, but want the sec
ond. This is a day when the church- of
God should be on guard against the intel
ligence of her faith. -We believe in creeds
of course, but we Presbyterians forget
that creeds are by no means all. We
boast of intelligence, but we should be
wary lest our glory become our shame
"The mystic element is needed to give
tenderness to the soul, but Christianity
like Mohammedism, has its whirling Der
vlshen. Some see but a long line of sin
cere purpose and ethical endeavor It is
not enough to be sincere; one must be
right."
B The moderator sounded a note of warn
ing regarding the public schools. Said he
"God forbid that I should say an ill
word against our public school system
the safeguard of our nation; but is the'
educational machinery subsidiary to the
only worthy end of fashioning character?
Have we; so morbidly afraid of uniting
church with state, gone so far as to dis
unite God from the state? This is a most
serious question. The faith of our sons
and daughters is involved, and the king
dom of God In our country is involved
"It is not an organized skepticism that
threatens, but a God-forgotten secular
ism."
The Rev. J. Milton Greene, D.'Â« D. now
stationed in Havana, but formerly of San
Juan, Porto Rico, where he organized
Presbyterian missions, created a profound
sensation in a sermon this, evening bv
severely, criticising the alleged immora'l
conduct of United States soldiers in Porto
R5co. Dr. -Greene addressed the meeting
on the conditions existing in that island
He said the conduct of the United States
soldiers was a. disgrace to humanity
Twenty drunken soldiers, he said, could
bo seen on the streets to one drunken na
tive. . -- : ."-/ .'/.>â¢/.
The lawlessness of the soldiers, he con
tinued, was . proverbial. â¢ He attacked tne
present system under which the chaplain,
worked, and said some one ought to ap
peal to the Government for a system by
which the spiritual welfare of our soldiers
could be better looked af ten *
Moderator Minton Says
Christianity Has Its
Dervishes.
THIS is the day upon "which the
wage-workers in the iron trades
have agreed to walk out unless the
proprietors meet the demands
made by them. Every machine
shop in San Francisco^ will be open this
morning. What the men who are demand
ing an increase in pay will do Is not defi
nitely known, but It seems certain that
they will refuse to go to work unless their
demands are acceded to. ,
No unusual precautions to prevent vio
lence have been taken by thelpollce de
partment. There lb a spirit of concilia
tion, as far as this city is concerned.
A meeting of the machinists interested*
in the outcome was held yesterday at the
Turk-street Temple. The session was
long, but orderly. The results were not
disclosed by the executive officers, Sec
retary Wlsler flatly refusing to give out
any information about the prospects.
The managers of the leading machine
works say that a week's or a month's
idleness will mean but little to them and
that they are prepared to meet the issue. !
Vice President Irving M. Scott of the
Union Iron Works fays that he, in con
junction with other employers of labor, is
willing to meet each machinist, listen to
bis personal grievance, and accord to him
all that may be his due. As to the other
factors involved, he says that each cÂ»n
dition will be met as the occasion occurs.
At the headquarters of the Labor Coun- |
cil It was stated that nothing had so far
been done to select a man to preside as
arbitrator between the employers and the
employes. The matter is now entirely in
the hands of the executive committee of
that body and upon its good judgment
may depend the result of the conflict.
The walking out of a large number of
machinists and men affiliated with the
iron trades would affect some subsidiary
branches and involve a large number of
men who are unwilling to strike. . '
responsy in New England to-morrow as
has been anticipated. The movement will
be seen in its full strength in Boston,
where about 1S0O machinists will strike.
To-day twelve large concerns granted the
men's demands. In Providence 500 ma
chinists will go out from two shops!
The situation in Connecticut is serious.
The strikers will be, it seems, confined to
a portion only of Connecticut cities, but
where they will occur they will be very
general and will accomplish virtually a
complete tieing up of the machinists",
screw workers' and metal workers' in
dustries. Hartford, Waterbury, Bridge
port, New Britain and the neighboring
â¢cities of Ansonia and Derby are the. storm
center. In these an estimated total of 6000
men will be idle when tha opening time
comes to-morrow morning.
Strike Averted in Denver.
DENVER. May 19.â The threatened
strike of the manufacturing machinists
has been averted, the local members of
the National Metal Trades Association
having been granted the nine-hour, day
and the scale of wages demanded by the
Machinists' Union.
Buffalo Machinists Will Strike.
BUFFALO, N. Y., May 19.â All the ma
chinists employed by the Lehigh Railway
system will strike to-morrow. About 1200
machinists in all in Buffalo.
CHURCH OF GOD
FACES DANGER
WASHINGTON. May 19.â The
strike order issued by the ex
ecutive board of the Interna
tional Order of Machinists
goes into effect at 7 o'clock to
morrow morning. President O'Connell
said to-night that about 50,000 men would
be affected. The order instructs the men
to refuse to go to work in all shops where
notices granting the nine hours' work day
have not been posted at 7 o'clock.
The officers of the association expect
that in many cases a settlement will be
reached during to-morrow and that the
men will return to work during the day
or Tuesday morning. Word came to-day
that all the firms in St. Louis and also
all those in New Orleans have acceded to
the demands of the men. Scattered re
ports from ether cities favorable to the
men were received. The estimate now Is
that 35 per cent of the employing firms
have tfgned. At least 25,000 union ma
chinists were working nine hours or less
when the question was taken up by the
association.
The 50.000 men who will suspend work
are scattered all over the country. The
national officers are hopeful that speedy
attempts will be made Jn most of the
Eastern cities to adjust the differences,
but they fear a more prolonged struggle
on the Pacific Coast. The Union â¢ Iron

tleship Ohio is being built, and other large
concerns are preparing to resist the de
mand.
Jn a number of cities there are ques
tions pending between the employers and
the men which may operate to prevent
decisive action to-morrow, but which may
be settled for or against* the strike in a
day or two. These include cities where
counter-propositions have been made by
the manufacturers and where conferences
with headquarters at Washington may be
necessary before action is taken. In these
instances compromises may be reached.
President O'Connell received on Satur
day a check for $1050 from the machinists
in the Washington navy yard to aid the
men on strike. These machinists are not
concerned directly in the differences with
employers which underlie the strike, but
in a letter to Mr.. O'Connell they stated
their interest in the triumph of their fel
low workmen, and promised him that sub
stantial financial contributions could be
expected from them every week toward
the support of those who will be out of
work.
MAY AVERT GENERAL STRIKE.
Leaders of Machinists Are Hopeful
of an Amicable Settlement.
NEW TOUR. May 19.â Whether to-mor
row is to see the beginning of a machin
ists' strike that shall rival the one in the
engineering trades in England which
X'layed so Important a part in the opening
of the markets of the world to the Ameri
cans is problematical. Leading labor men
and representatives of the leading em
ployers said to-day that they thought
pending questions would be settled with
out any general strike. It was intimated
that J. Pierpont Morgan might be ap
pealed to and requested to use his influ
ence w^th the great industrial combina
tions in the interests of peace.
Meetings of machinists were held at va
rious places in this city to-day to. discuss
the local situation. After getting reports
from all the shops in the metropolitan
district the conclusion was reached that
fhops employing alxiut one-half of all the
machinists in the greater city would grant
the r.ine-hour day and the. 12^2 per cent
increase in wages without trouble and
that not more than 4000 men at the outside
would eo out on strike.
. Among the big shops In New Tork City
Â¦where strikes are considered among the
possibilities are the Garvan Machine Com
pany, where about 2-*>0 machinists are em
ployed: the Hoe works, with about 800 ma
chinists, and the General Incajidescent
Arc Light Company, with 250 machinists.
In Brooklyn, the Worthington Pump
Works, with 100 machinists, may experi
ence a strike. Trouble is also expected at
several New Jersey cities and towns. At
PIninfleld. N. J.. it is expected to-night
that 1000 machinists out of 1200 employed
in that city will go out to-morrow morn
ing. Newark is expecting a strike in the
morning In three of the four big com
panies there. The fourth, the Crocker-
Wheeler Company, has agreed to compro
mise with the men at nine and one-half
hours. At C'amden. the indications are
that there will be a considerable number
<jf machinists go out.
All Union Machinists of Chicago
Iraac Cowen ol the Amalgamated Soci
pty of Engineers reported to the Central
Ffr-oerated Union to-day that the 20,000
members of the organization in this coun

CHICAOO. May 19.â The Chicago Feder
ation of Labor to-night indorsed the de
mands of the International Association of
Machinists and pledged Its moral and
financial support during the struggle
which the machinists will inaugurate to
morrow. According to the decision of the
executive board of District No. 8, Interna
tional Association of Machinists, repre
senting all union machinists of Chicago
and vicinity, the general strike will go
Into effect in this city to-morrow morning.
In a dozen shops the men will refuse to
work unless their employers agree to
grant their demands. The pattern-makers
at the Gates Iron Works and at the Fras-
er & Chalmers machinery manufacturing
plant have decided to make a demand for
3ZVi cents an hour and if the demand is
not granted to go on strike.
St. Louis advices state that forty-four of
the largest machine shops in the city have
signed the nine-hour agreement, leaving
only four large concerns which have not
signed. Three of the latter decided to-day
to continue at work in the hope of effect
ing| a compromise.
At Louisville, Ky., the Indications are
to-night that 500 machinists will be Idle
to-morrow. Only one employer has grant
ed the men's demands. Indianapolis re
ports that 175 machinists out of 862 in that
â¢city, and twenty boilermakers out of sixty
two will strike to-morrow. In St. Paul
the order for the strike of machinists will
not be obeyed. About 200 of the 400 union
machinists in Kansas City, who struck a
week ago to enforce the local demands,
will remain out to-morrow in respect to
the general demand for nine hours. The
other 200 men have alreadv returned to
work and the indications are they will not
strike.
RAILWAYS AGAIN .OPERATING.
Heavy Fall of Rain Keeps the People
Within Doors at Albany.
ALBANY. N. Y.. May 19.-The incidents
of this, the first day of active operations
of all the railways, have been few be
cause of the heavy fall of rain. The two
men shot by National Guardsmen were
buried this afternoon. The pouring rain
kept away the thousands of sightseers
that otherwise would have been present.
The departure of the Twenty-third Regi
ment early this morning was the second
feature of the day. and stirring sermons
In many city pulpits aided in ,closing the
incident.
The funeral of Leroy Smith was devoid
of incident except that it was attended by
the city official:: and the directors of the
street railway company. At the funeral
of William Walsh there was nearly a riot.
While the services were proceeding in the
church the crowd that had been unable
to gain admittance saw a uniformed sol
dier coming down the street. Instantly
the people were In a state of ferment. A
rush was made for the soldier, but a few
wise heads held the crowd back for a
minute, while several others advised the
man to run. Arguing that discretion was
the better part of valor, he did run, and
the trouble was avoided. .
The starting out of the first car of the
Inter-City line shortly after noon to-day
was the cause of a demonstration. Pistols
were fired, flags waved, torpedoes were
placed on the track and exploded, the
motormen and conductors wore flags on
their coats and fully 200 men and women
fought for the privilege of the first ride.

ANOTHER native son of the Golden
West has won lasting , honor in
the East. Martin 'A;. Meyer has
>been appointed a . fellow of the
American Archaeological School
at. Jerusalem.. and .will spend a' year In
Palestine doing special work for that so
ciety in the -unexplored regions of the
Holy Land.._ . " v
Candidates' for the fellowship, which,
besides the expenses of a, year's sojourn
in Palestine, carries "with " it a bonus of
$500, had to pass a very rigid examination.
Among, the -subjects were Latin, ; Greek,
Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Aramaic and the
geography of Palestine. Two of the con
testants.were professors from Eastern col
leges, ; the greater portion of whose;
has. been spent. in the study.of Latin and
Greek and the other . dead languages. Mr.
Meyer carried off the coveted honor, how
ever, and Professor Thayer of the Boston
School of Theology expressed himself in
the, warmest terms of praise regarding the
young man's merits as a scholar and con
gratulated the Hebrew Union College upon
Ithe success obtained by its representative.
Rabbi-elect Meyer, who has thus dis
tinguished himself, is. only, twenty-three
years of ase. He is the eldest son. of
Charles Meyer, the well-known merchant
tailor of this city, and received his early
training in the public schools of San Fran

MASKED FOOTPADS BEAT

Waylay Him on His Way Home and

-. Money.
J. S. Downey, a deaf mute who Is em
ployed in the Gas, Kitchen on Thirteenth
near Washington street. Oakland, was
waylaid on his way home last night by
two masked footpads and robbed ofi $18. all
the -money In his possession at the time.
The robbery occurred 'shortly after mid
night at the head of the boulevard near
the corner of Third avenue and EiÂ£nt
eentn street.
Downey did not see the footDads until
they stepped out in front of him and com
manded him to throw up his hands. Being
unable to. hear, he paid no attention to
their demands, and. in consequence was
brutally "beaten over the head with^the
butt end of a revolver.
After they had beaten their victim into
a tfrelpless condltlpn the footpads pro
ceeded to rifle his pockets of their con
tents. - _ .Â¦' '..'..
The hold-up was reported : to the police
as soon as possible, but Downey was un
able to â¢ give a good description of the
footpads. Â« â¢ . ;â¢"
- Word has been received here that Martin A.
Meyer has just been appointed a fellow of the
American Archaeological Â¦ School at Jerusalem,
after^a competitive examination out of which
the young rabbinical candidate came with first
honors. We have news that Rabbi-elect Meyer
will accept the fellowship, go to Jerusalem
next October, and spend one year with an
archaeological expedition to do some original
work In the - still unexplored ruins of ancient
Palestine. That is a wise conclusion of which
we heartily approve. We can spare Mr. Meyer
from the pulpit for a year or two, but the
honor of having a Jewish scholar represented
in the annual archaeological expeditions of the
American school is one not to be underesti
mated. That it has come to Mr. Meyer is an
attestation of his own Intellectual merits and
a source of pride to all San Francisco, where
this lad was born, and where he received his
first, training.
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger has this to say
of the young man's success in Emanu-El:
ing colors his father placed him under pri
vate tutors until he should be of age to
enter college. "When - the time came he
went to the University of Cincinnati and
graduated the day he reached his major
ity. From the university the young stu
dent went to ' the Hebrew Union College
and next month will receive his degree
from that institution and will be duly or
dained a rabbi.
Thousands of Sightseers
Throng City of
BUFFALO, May 19.â The eve of the ded
ication of the Pan-American Kxposition
sees a welcome break in a cheerless rain
storm, a city gay in' a dress of bunting
and a happy people proud of the realiza
tion of their hope and work of two years.
To-morrow at noon, after a parade, partly
military and partly civic, with ceremonies
of dignity becoming the occasion, the
great fair will be dedicated to the liberal
and peaceful arts, which it typifies. Dedi
cation day will find the Rainbow city al
most ready for its pleasure-seeking popu-i
lation. The great buildings in the exposi
tion city -are practically completed, but
the installation of exhibits has proceeded
very "slowly and completeness in that -re
spect stretches away to some indefinite
date in June. There has been a cpneen
tration of energy in the-effort to prepare
the exposition grounds for the opening
ceremonies, and . an immense v amount has
been accomplished in the last twenty-four
hours. ' * . â
An army of 3000 men is engaged in clean
ing the buildings, grounds and streets,
and thousands of carpenters, painters and
other artisans are at work on and in the
buildings. The last of the network of scaf
folding, that, for weeks has enveloped
buildings- and towers is being torn away,
and the exterior view to-morrow will be
marred by . but : few signs of incomplete
ness. The scenes within the grounds to
day were interesting. The sun fought its
way through rain and clouds by noon, and
a bright afternon : brought, thousands of
visitors. The tenants of the Midway were
idle for the day, and many of the attend
ants at the foreign exhibits mingled with
the crowd and gave it a cosmopolitan air.
The Mexican, band gave a concert, in the
plaza and drew , a large . crowd about the
stand. .-...Â¦" Â¦ '. : \ â¢'; '
The city is. rapidly filling with visitors,
and if to-morrow, dawns bright it is esti
mated that 150,000 persons will participate
in the ceremonies. Vice President Roose
velt, accompanied by the "members of his
family, arrived to-night." Senators Hanna

"Naturally I, first asked his opinion of
the attitude of the United States in the

"It has been a matter of sincere pleas

of opinion, found herself on . the same
side as Russia and of the same "opinion."
"Is Russia anxious toget out of China
as soon as possible?"

But so long 1 as large forces of troops re

"England makes trouble there, does she
not?" .
Diplomatically avoiding any direct re

- - The accounts of the several concerns havÂ« been examined by Messrs. , Jones, Caesar ft

each of the last two fiscal years, after making full provisions for depredation and bad '-
debts, but without charging Interest and Â¦ management salaries, exceeded the amount re-
quired to pay seven per cent, dividends upon $16,250,000 Preferred . Stock, whilst for the last ,
.fiscal year the profits, as above defined, ' considerably exceeded such amount." It was not
until the last year that the new works of Fraser '. & .. Chalmers came into full operation.
The net profits for the fiscal year ending May 1. 1902. ; are estimated by the chief offi-
cials of the respective companies, without any allowance for increase of manufacturing
Â¦ capacity^ or for the economies of consolidation, or Increase of prices, at sufficient to pay
Â¦ dividends at the rate. of seven per cent, on: the $16,250,000 Preferred Â¦ Stock and about four
per cent, on $20,000,000 of. Common Stock. Including the economies from consolidation con-
fidently anticipated by, these authorities, the net profits for the same period should ex- r
ceed the amount required to pay seven per cent.^dividends on both classes of stock..
The Â¦ same officials similarly estimate that upon the completion of the additional Allls
Works, now In process of construction, ' the profits will be equivalent to eight per cent, on
.$16,250,000 .of Preferred Stock and ten â¢ per cent, on $20,000,000 of Common Stock, with a

BRITISH ARMY REFORMS.
BY a vote of 305 to 163 Mr. Brodrick, the Brit
ish Secretary of State for War, has managed
to have his scheme of army reform adopted by
the Commons. It is stated, however, that the vote
does not truly represent the sentiment of Parliament,
but was obtained only by the action of the Ministry in
making it one of confidence. To have defeated the
bill under such circumstances would have been to
precipitate a Ministerial crisis, and ' consequently
many who object to the measure voted, for it in the
expectation that it will be amended in the Lords.
That there is objection to the measure is not sur
prising. In all countries army reforms are difficult,
and in Great Britain they are exceptionally so. For
a long time the British army has been almost as much
a social as a^ military institution. Men of wealth and
rank enter the service largely because of the prestige
in society given to the officers of crack regiments.
Moreover, 'for years the interests of the army have
been subordinated to those of. the navy, and com
paratively little has been done to render it effective
for meeting any great' emergency. '. â¢ , :
In closing the debate on the subject Mr. Balfour, the
Government leader, pointed out the negligent manner
in which the military affairs of the nation. had been
attended to in the past. When the present Conser
vative Government entered; office it, was found, ac
cording to' Balfour, that tflje supply of ammunition
for small arms was only 92,000,000 rounds instead of
146,000,000, which had been fixed as the minimum
supply, and, furthermore, there was no reserve artil
lery ammunition except what was with the guns re
; tained at home. '
The War Department appears, indeed, to have been
conducted like what Dickens once, described as a
"circumlocution office,'" in which every official was
mainly intent on "how-not-to-do" his work. In the
speech with which he presented his reform bill to the
Commons Mr. Brodrick gave many striking illus
trations of the inadequacy of . the service of the de
partment. Some of them go far toward affording an
explanation of the failure of all efforts of successive
Secretaries to accomplish anything in the way of im
proving the military forces of the kingdom. _. . â¢
In speaking of the inefficiency of the staff officers
Mr. Brodrick said: "I received a letter from ~ a Re
servist who had made application for further . ser
vice, and who for two months had waited withoutre
ceiving an answer. I made inquiry, .and I told
that the man should riot have written to the Secre-

BRIGHT COMMERCIAL CONDITIONS.
LAST week witnessed the clearing off of the Wall
street cyclone as far as the present is concerned.
The market is now as quiet as it was excited a
few days ago. The public is sold out, thousands of
disappointed and disgusted speculators have left the
street, and the professionals again have .the market
to themselves. Most of them are re-arranging their
financial feathers, like a flock of bedraggled poultry,
pluming themselves after a hard shower. Some bold
spirits are again buying, but they are confining their
purchases to the safest stocks in sight â those from
which they can reasonably expect dividends right
along. The sentiment of the street, however, is
bullish.
General trade continues to make a brilliant show
ing. The bank clearings of the country last week
showed a gain of 104.5 per cent over the correspond
ing week last year, but about 75 per cent of this in
crease occurred in Wall 'street, and was due to the
larger volume of speculation and stock gambling this
year. But the gain in the other cities represented a
legitimate increase in trade, and ranged from 3 per
cent at Minneapolis to 50 per cent at St. Louis.
Every important city in the country showed a gain.
The staples, while without especial feature, are mak
ing a good exhibit The demand for the crude forms
of iron and steel is reported lighter, but the mills re
port orders enough for finished products to keep
them running for three months, with new orders com
ing in right along. The. hardware trade is also re
ported active, and there is a continued demand for all
building material. Seme of the best reports, are be
ing received from leather and boots and shoes, ship
ments of the latter from the New England factories
being 48 per cent larger than at this time last year.
Farming supplies, including field implements, are in
large and steady demand, which is to be expected in
view of the fine crop prospects all over the country.
The textiles, however, continue to drag, woolen goods
and clothing being quiet and cotton lower again.
Wheat and corn are about 10c per bushel higher thati
at this time last year, though at best they are not high
enough to hurt anybody, and could stand considerable
advance over present quotations without inconven
iencing the public Money continues easy and plenti
ful everywhere, and the only cloud in sight is the per
sistent menace of labor disturbances, which tend to
prevent the organization of new enterprises and to
render capital very cautious. â¢ x^
In San Francisco the Presidential visit has checked
business in most lines. Tuesday and Saturday, were
largely holidays, so there were really not more than
four full business days during the week. But the tone
of trade on this coast continues very good. Our crop
outlook, except for fruit, which will be short, is flat
tering, and the higher prices confidently expected for
fruit will probably offset the loss in the volume of the
product. A very good sign is the higher range of
values already established for the early fruit and hay
now coming in, which is an encouraging augury for
the balance of the season. For the rest, our banks
fiave plenty of funds, and are cheerful lenders on .the
usual security, while, rates of interest are moderate.
Collections are reported good and failures are few
and small.
The failures for the whole country last week were
192. against 155 for the same week last year. The
increase last week was largely due to the collapse of
a number of minor business firms in the East through
the break in Wall street, which, happily, produced
no effect of any consequence on the Pacific Coast.
THE. CASE , OF JUDGE NOYES.
BY the issue of a citation': commanding Judge
Noyes of , the United States District; Court; at
Nome and. Attorney Thomas J. Geary to appear
before the United States Circuit Court of Appeals to
answer to a charge of, contempt of court, a step has
been taken in a movement which will doubtless result
in a complete exposure of the whole of those extraor
dinary proceedings at Nome which constitute such a
grave scandal iri the administration of law.
Since Judge Noyes has now to appear before the
court it is but ! right and fair that his case be not
prejudged by the public. He is entitled under our
system of law and in natural justice to have an im
partial hearing hot only before his judges but at the
bar of public opinion. His defense should be heard
fully before final-judgment is pronounced; and ac
cordingly, until his defense has been made known,
The Call, at least, will not undertake to declare wheth
er or no he has been guilty of offenses against the
public and in violation of the duties of the high office
he-holds. â¢ .. Â¦
When everything has been conceded, however, that
justice demands or Judge Noyes and Mr. Geary can
ask, enough' remains to justify a feeling of gratification
that they, have ibeen cited to show cause why they
should not be punished for contempt. The evidence
that has been made public by testimony given in the
â¢trial of Alexander McKenzie, the receiver appointed
by Judge Njpyes;, is sufficient. to justify the belief that
something in the nature of gross judicial outrages
were committed in assigning various mines at Nome
to the control of McKenzie. Such offenses are among
Â¦the, .most menacing that can affect an American com
munity, for the courts under our -constitution are
given, such vast powers that should ; they become the
seats of corruption the very life of society would b ? e
endangered.' /':./,,. \. ' '.Â¦
Â¦The scandal is not'a^slight one. It is not a matter
jvvhich either the liigher courts of the United States
or the public can- afford to overlook. From evidence
already made known it appears that the proceedings
at Nome involve not only the Judge of the United
States Court of that district but men holding, high
office at Washington. It seems that something like
a conspiracy was formed by rich and powerful men
to obtain possession of the gold mines at Nome either
by fair means or by foul, and that these men were so
confident of their strength and of their influence that
they did not hesitate to defy an order of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, and to proceed illegally and de
fiantly upon the course marked out.
Receiver McKenzie has been proven guilty of x con
tempt" and is now in jail. It is- but right therefore
that others supposed to be his accomplices should be
brought to trial. If convicted of contempt it will then
be the duty the House of Representatives to take
steps to impeach the corrupt Judge. Of our courts
it may be said that like the wife of Caesar they must
not only be pure but must be above suspicion. We
cannot tolerate injustice ; on the bench, and ; conse
quently there is a deep feeling of gratification in the
public mind that the Circuit Court of Appeals has
determined to bring the whole case before it for inves
tigation and judgment. Â«.

Triple Expansion Pumping Engines.
It has already been mentioned that Mr.
Reynolds has the distinction of designing
and building the first triple expansion
pumping engine for waterworks, ana u
might be added that the original design
has been adhered to very closely "*f u . D T
sequent practice. According to omciai
records a test of this machine showed a
duty of 152,448,000 foot pounds for each
1000 pounds of steam used. AH attempts
at building large engines of this kind had
proved unsuccessful because of the jaca
and shocks experienced, but this defect
was entirely eliminated in Mr. Reynolds
design, which at once Insured for it par
ticular favor, even' before the high effi
ciency, of the combination was known.
The cross compound hoisting' engine for
large mining enterprises may be accepted -
as a fair example of the mining machin
ery turned out under his supervision.: The
cylinders of these engines are fifty feet
apart from center to center.
In spite of the many demands upon
his time, Mr. Reynolds devotes much
attention to the work- of his contem
poraries, and, although he started life
with scant education, he has since ac
quired a valuable fund of information,
covering a wide range of subjects. En
gineering and mechanical works remain
his favorite study, however, and his
eminent position has been recognized by
tne University of 'Wisconsin, which con
ferred the degree of doctor of laws upon
him in 1895. and later placed' his name
among those of distinguished scientists
and inventors that occupy places 01
honor upon its new hall devoted to en
gineering. The Paris Exposition of 1389
conferred upon him the unusual distinc
tion of s awarding him personally, al
though not an . exhibitor, a ' gold - medal
for the excellence* of his design oÂ£ ma
chinery exhibited by others.
Activities of a Busy Career.
While he is primarily a. great inventor,
Mr. Reynolds possesses many character
istics which distinguish him from most
of those who are occupied with the de
signing of machinery" It has already
been explained that Mr. Reynolds left
Providence to accept the position of
general superintendent of the Reliance
Works, then owned by E. P. Allis &
Co. of Milwaukee, > and that ever since
he has remained in charge of this great
plant and the 2500 men now employed in
it. After his arrival in Milwaukee on
July Â¦ 1, 1877, he speedily won the con
fidence of Mr. Allls, not only through
his mechanical skill and genius, but be
cause of his integrity and manhood, and
this confidence was strengthened as
time passed. He developed great exec
utive ability and rare financial judgment.
Upon the death of Mr. Allis Mr. Rey
nolds became, . through the will of. Mr.
Allis, one of the trustees . of . the estate,
and later, when the business was reor
ganized and the Allis Company formed,
he was chosen one of the directors and
second vice president. .Besides these po
sitions, he is president of the Milwaukee
Boiler Company, -.the Daisy Roller Mills
Company and the German-American
Bank, and is second vice president and
superintendent of. the Reliance .Works in
Milwaukee. Â¦ . Â¦ â¢ .
Mr. Reynolds owns a beautiful place
at Mansfield, Conn., the home of his boy
hood, and several adjoining farms, se
gregating over 600. acres. His family
lives there during the summer, and Mr.
R3ynolds spends as much time there as
he can spare from his business.
Still Engaged on New Problems.
Although he is now nearing 70 years
of age, ne is still actively engaged on
engineering. problems, and it is not too
much to expect that the new century
will witness the perfection of many of
those Improvements and inventions which
he is now developing. His career, begun
in obscurity in a small New England
town and continued . through hardship
and adversity before recognition was
finally gained, is being rounded out by
the production of machinery of marvel
ous design, construction and operation.

2ET.V.â EDWIN REYNOLDS.
jln the. minds, of. those familiar with
modern steam practice the name of Edwin
Reynolds will be associated,. with that of
Corliss, because of his work in the devel
opment of the 'steam engine. ' His reputa
tion' is â¢ not' confined 'to "this country, for
the Reynolds-Corliss engine, embodying
the improvements introduced by him, has
been recognized throughout- the world as
the standard type of machines of .this
class, and has been adopted In foreign
countries of late, wherever exceptionally
heavy, and, exacting-service is required.
Even^in Greats Britain, where prejudice
against American innovations was strong
est, the engineers of the city of Glasgow
accepted â¢ the Reynolds-Corliss engines in
competition against the leading Scotch
and English types, because they were su
perior in every respect and because of the
wide experience and high reputation I In
the engineering world" of the designer and
builder. . .
Mr. Reynolds' Is a fair type of . the
shrewd, intelligent Yankee, who exacts
the rewards which fortune of ten, grudg
ingly i withholds from less persistent and
determined characters. A New Kngland
lad, starting in life as a machinist with
out money or Influential friends, and not
Â£ ven favored with an education beyond
that obtained in the common schools fifty
years ago, by force of character, perse
verance, integrity and natural ability, he
has gained wealth, â¢: position, . reputation
and all the enjoyments that commercial
success and culture Â¦ command.
Early Years as an \ Engineer.'
His early years were passed in Connec
ticut, his native State. He was born at
Mansfield, Conn., March 23, 1831. He went
to school until 1847, when he . entered a
machine shop as apprentice. After three
years' training he .followed several
branches of mechanical work, gaining ex
perience in the best shops and under the
ablest engineers in New England, Ohio
and Indiana. From 1857 to 1861 he was su
perintendent of the. shops of Stedman &
Cat, at Aurora, Ind. The building of saw
mill engines and drainage pumps for Mis
sissippi plantations was looked upon in
those days as heavy engineering, and Mr.
Reynolds had much experience in both' of
those branches; consequently, when he
was secured by the Corliss Steam Engine
Company in "1867 for the shops at Provi
dence, he was considered one of the best
equipped men In the country. But it was
while he occupied the position of general
superintendent of those shops, to which
he was promoted in 1S71, that he besan
his experimental investigations which led
to marked improvements In the Corliss en
gine and first won for him recognition as
the leading- steam-engineering authority
of the time. In 1877 he withdrew from
the Providence works and took the posi
tion of general superintendent of the E. P.
Allls & Co.'s shops, and ever since he has
been . In charge of the great Milwaukee
engineering works, with which his name
has been closely identified. .
A, Designer of Great Engines.
His experimental work on the steam en
gine was continued in his new position
upon a much larger scale and with better
facilities than formerly, and his rare me
chanical genius found other channels
through which to put forth the products
of his inventive faculties. Mr. Reynolds
is a thorough student of mechanics, and
the engines which have been constructed
from. his designs are to be found in nearly,
every civilized country on the globe. They
are employed in city "pumping stations,
electric lighting an3 street railway plants,
blast furnaces, rolling mills, cotton mills,
mines and wherever power is required. He
was the father of the first triple expan
sion pumping engine and the first man to
substitute the solid bottom for spring tim
bers in the heavy stamps employed in the
reduction of copper ores in the Lake Su
perior region. This change from form
er practice has increased the capacity of
the stamps about 50 per cent and i3 now
the standard construction by all builders.
Under Mr. Reynolds', supervision many
important - engineering problems have
been solved, and work performed, thy
magnitude of which has excited the
wonder of the mechanical world. The
great steam engine at the Centennial ex
position and the later types exhibited at
the World's Fair in Chicago have, long
since been surpassed. The influence of
Mr Reynolds' work is felt in many de
partments in which he is not directly en
gaged. For instance, the big engines
which he designed for rolling-mill service

whether the man was to be allowed to go or not,* and
said so. j I waited! a fortnight, and, hearing 1 nothing,
I wrote again, 'requesting a prompt reply,;fbr which
I waited another week. , Then -I sent a_telegram say
ing I must know,' and still nothing came. At
the end of the fourthVeek I; thought the time
come to exercise my authority. I wrote to'the adju
tant general, and said if I did not receive an answer,
on the following morning somebody -would "go on
half-pay. I got an answer the next morning. Here is
an instance of needless delay still more grotesque:
A paper came before me last November in relation
to whether a particular cottage should be shut up, or
pulled down, or repaired at an expense of Â£130.
Then I ascertained the history of that paper.- It
started in 1896 and came. to me in November, 1900.
In the interval it had been touring about between
three military ; officers. : In the second year it reached
the .War Office, and the ; Assistant Under Secretary
sent it to the commander, in chief. Then, as officers ;
had been changed meanwhile, it went again on its
peregrinations, and the result was that^after four
years the matter stiirremained unsettled."' . ".
When' "such abuses ' exist in the 'administration of
military affairs there can be no question that reform
is imperative. It' happens, however, that there are al
ways men who profit by governmental abuses, and
those men, with "their friends, are always opposed ;to
reform movements. -Even the ill success which has
attended the British armies in South Africa has" not
weakened the sluggish opposition of the staff, and, as
has just been shown in the Commons, it has takena
threat on the part of the Ministry to resign if the bill
were defeated to bring about even the first step-in
the direction of, reform. '

is to be twenty-two knots and she will bÂ©

the disposition o* the guns, the eight six

which latter two are aft, two forward and
two on each broadside. The American
idea of superimposed turrets has been im

avoided. The manner of locating the tur

turret is placed in sponson, projecting over

The fleets of the seven largest naval
powers are reported by a recent admir
alty return to number as follows:
PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S, speech at the;
launching of the Ohio on Saturday was. in many
respects the most notable utterance he has made
during his tour. It was in some sense a declaration
of his public policies; an emphatic enunciation of his
devotion to the cause of American labor, commerce
and prosperity. ; . ,â¢
It was with fervor he said: "I. am glad again to
meet the workingmen of the country. All my public*
life has been devoted to give workingmen the best
opportunity, the best chance for good wages and
steady employment. When labor is well employed
the country is safe, and there is contentment and hap
piness in the home of the workers. Let us do our
duty, the great public duty that confronts us; let us
do it walking humbly before God, dealing justly and
mercifully and always asking his favor and guidance."
From that declaration the world can take the meas
ure of the statesman and the man. His statesmanship
is to establish security for the homes of the people by
providing ample work for industry and ample wages
to sustain workers in the comfort to which Americans
are entitled; and his religion is to carry out his official
duties with a conscience ever heedful of divine com
mand. It is a simple platform, but it is sufficiently
broad and strong to carry the best hopes of humanity.
By the protective system with which the President
is more closely identified than any other living states
man the industries of the people have been built up
and made secure. The next duty of the Government
is to make clear the way for merchants to obtain
larger markets for our products, and it is- an illustra
tion of the progressive character of the man that the
President now preaches the doctrine of commerce as
earnestly as he ever preached that of productive ia
dustry. The essential point of his speech of Saturday
was a plea for American, trade and American ships;
and no plea could have been more appropriate to the
occasion or more in accord with the sentiments of
the audience. . \ Â¦
After giving due commendation to the skill of the
workmen who constructed the Olympia, which served
Admiral Dewey as a flagship in that glorious victory
in Manila Bay, and the peerless Oregon whose mar
velous journey around the Horn amazed the naval
experts of the world, and alluding to other noble craft
built in the Union Iron Works, he went on to say:
"What we want is to build more ships. We ought to
have a good commercial line from here to the Philip
pines, built by American workingmen, manned by
American sailors and carrying the American flag.
There is nothing in this world that brings people so
close together as commerce. There is nothing in this
world that so much promotes the universal brother
hood of man as commerce, and we want to encourage
commerce."
The encouragement of commerce and the promotion
of the American merchant marine is indeed the im
portant* issue of the time. So long as the great bulk
of our export and import trade is carried in foreign
ships we must pay annual tribute to the foreigner;
and not only must the great ship-building industries
of the country lag instead of going forward by leaps
and bounds, but all other industries must suffer by the
annual drain of money and the loss of that addition
to the home market which would be furnished by the
extension of ship-building and the increase Â¦ of our
merchant fleets. â¢ . . 1 . '.. : *
All Californians will be gratified,by the warmth with
which the President spoke of the part California "acted
during the war with Spain and particularly, with the
patriotic praise given to our.' volunteers! -We may.
long remember with just pride the words spoken on
the responsibility of the Presidential office: "As the
head of the nation, I want to thank the people of this
coast for their noble -work during the Spanish war,
and I want to make special reference and acknowl
edgement, for I may not have another opportunity,
to the gallant First California Volunteers, that was
among the first in the field and almost the last to leave
it, and performed conspicuous and gallant service in
the campaign in the Philippine Islands."
Such words coming from the head of the nation are
not to be taken as an idle compliment. They stand
as an official recognition of the credit due to our
young commonwealth, and may rightly be remem
bered with satisfaction. To the workingmen, to the
volunteers and to all Californians the speech appealed
in the right way and by the right words. It i's to
be hoped, moreover, that all may profit by them and
work together for the general good and the prosperity
of the republic.

According to Mr. O'Conner, Lord Hugh
Cecil, son _ of the Marquis of Salisbury,
has done much to aggravate this antago
nism to the premier nepotism. "When
this fanatical, extreme, foolish and head
strong young man gets up and pronounces
his view, people begin to ask, *Is there no
escape from these Cecils?' and so poor
Lord Hugh, with his pallid face and his
long, thin, lanky body and his wild and
youthful enthusiasm, is the straw that
breaks* the camel's back of endurance ,by
his part of his family."
LONDON, May .19-â Henry u. Massing

8 reception to Rev. Father Piu3 Mur-
Jl phy, provincial of the Dominican
order on the Pacific Coast, who is
about to return to this city after an ex
tended visit to Rome, to which place he
went on official business. Father Murphy
left here last August to make a report to
the master general of the,order regarding
the affairs of his jurisdiction. This re
port is filed every ten years, and the pro
vincial is delegated to convey the informa
tion personally to his superior. Father
Murphy's place has been filled during his
absence by the Rev. T. C. Clancy, O. P.
imprisoned member and it broke the force
of the pressure, but was driven four
inches into the wood in doing so. Will
iamson was taken to the Harbor Hospital,
where his injuries were dressed.
It was decided that the best way to wel
come Father Murphy would-be by a sub
stantial recognition of the high regard in
which he is held. This will take the form
of a purse, which it is expected will con
tain at least $2000, contributed by the par
ishioners in small amounts," which will be
presented to him at a public reception to
be held eltherin Franklin HaH or-in the
rooms of the monastery, at the corner of
Pine and Steiner streets. , This reception
will be held in the latter part of June, as
Father jj Murphy is expected home then.
The decorations will be in the hands of
the Dominican Sisters, and the school
children under their charge will take part
in a programme of a varied character.
An address will be delivered by one of
the prominent members of the congrega
tion, and Father Murphy will tell of his
experiences while on his trip. ,

THE NAPLES SUICIDE
Unfortunate Proves to Be the
Rsv. Maltbie Davenport

NAPLES, May IS.â Further Investiga
tion into the case of the American clergy
man who committed suicide here yester
day in the International Hospital by sev
ering an artery of .his wrist and swallcw
ing corrosive sublimate, and who was
mentioned in yesterday's dispatches as
Mr. Maltle, an American evangelical min
ister, proves the suicide to have been the
Rev. Maltbie Davenport Babcock.
NEW YORK, May 19.â One of the clos
est friends whom Dr. Babcock had in this
city was W. D. Barbour, a member of the
Brick Presbyterian Church congregation.
"If this dispatch is correct,'' said he,
"and I do not doubt that it is, then Dr.
Babcock was cut of his head when he
took his life. Mr. Babcock saw every
thing in the sunniest light, and he was
just bubbling with good health and was
an athlete."
Dr. Babcock had been pastor of the Brick
church since November 8, 1899, coming j
from Brown Memorial Church, in Balti- i
more. He received a salary of $12,000 a
year.
Though a. young man, Dr.Â« Babcock at
tained eminence as a pulpit orator and a
theologian. He had the reputation of be
ing a scholar and a worker, full of en
ergy and fearless in his methods of
thought. Dr. Babcock was a graduate of
the Syracuse University. His first charge
was the First Presbyterian Church of
Lockport, S. Y.

The Katie Flickenger. which sailed from
Eureka last Wednesday for Mollendo,
Peru, with a cargo of lumber, put in here
in distress late Saturday night. Whan
one day out from Humboldt Bay some
heavy weather, accompanied by a heavy
cross sea, was encountered. The barken
tine labored heavily and finally sprang a
leak. Captain Soderman says he was
then sixty miles west-southwest of
Eureka, so he decided to head for San
Francisco. On her arrival- here the vessel
was leaking at the rate of ten inches an
hour. The Katie Flickenger will dis
charge and be repaired here.
water Front Notes.
The ship Henry Villard arrived from
Honolulu yesterday with a. cargo of su
gar. Captain Quick had some trouble
with his men just before leaving the
islands. Sailing day all hands were drunk
and the man at the wheel not knowing
how to . steer there was nearly a col
lision.
The steamship Mexico leaves for Puget
Sound this week to enter the Nome
trade. She was formerly the British
steamer Manauense and made one trip as
a transport. She has been purchased by
D. E. Cane of Seattle for" the gold field
trade. As she is not an American vessel
Mr. Crane will have to run her from Vic
toria. B. C.
Repairs to the steamship Helen are
now competed. She ' will come down
from the Union Iron Works to-morrow
and will load at Pacific-street wharf for
Honolulu.
Captain J. A. Lockhart, late with the
Oceanic Steamship Company, is going to
sail a forty-foot yacht to Nome. He and
a few other 1 adventurous spirits have pur
chased the Helene and will fit her out with
a schooner rig for the run north. They
will not start for a couple of weeks, as
the captain expects to make a Quick voy
age. Â¦ â¢ â¢
Walter Jones, a photographer, lost an
SS5 camera overboard at Mission^street
wharf Saturday. Fred Link, a boatman,
recovered it in thirty feet of water and
was well rewarded for his labor.
Barkentine in Distress.
City of Stockton Damaged.
The river steamer City of Stockton was
in trouble again yesterday. While dock
ing at Washington-street wharf she col
lided with the Onisbo and lost oart of her
starboard bulwarks, and her upper works
were damaged. The Onisbo was lying at
Washington-street wharf all ready to take
out a party of lroauois "braves. Uer
wheel protruded beyond the end of the
wharf, and that was what caused the
trouble. While trying to make a landing
against the ebb tide the City of Stockton
struck the projecting wheel and, had not
the Onisbo's stern line carried away,
that vessel would not have taken out her
excursionists.
The Kambyses brought a large cargo,
consisting principally of paper, woolens
and coffee. From Mexico she brought ud
14 bars of silver and 700 bass of concen
trates. Her cabin passengers were R. W.
Nife. A. A. Botzbach, A. Burmeister. O.
A. Walter and B. Chavarri.
burg on January 9 last and from there
went to Antwerp and London. Leaving
the latter port on February 13, she went
via the Straits of Magellan to Valparaiso
and thence to Callao and Guayaquil, sail
ing from the latter port on April 18. After
touching at nearly all the Central Amer
ican ports she sailed from Mazatlan on
May 13 and made the run ud the coast in
less than six days. The Kambyses will
be followed by the Hermonthis, Ammon
and Anubis. . *

A. special tennis match between
Merle Johnson and Harold Crowell was
played yesterday, - and resulted in an
easy victory for the former. There has
been considerable discussion of late " as
to which of these players is the better
Several months ago Crowell defeated
Johnson without much trouble, but the
iatter has been- improving steadily since
and the ease with which he disposed of
OroweU yesterday proved conclusively
that he is a better player than his op
ponent. The score in Johnson's favor
was 6-2, 6-L 6-3. His style is very pe
culiar, and Crowell could do but . little
with the more aggressive game of his
opponent. In spite of his crushing de
feat Crowell was not satisfied with the
outcome, and consequently . a return
match will be played in the near future.
The Pacific States Lawn Tennis Asso
ciation will hold .a. meeting to-night,
when several important cfuestions will
be settled. The most important question
and the one that is interesting the
cracks the most is as to whether the sin
gles tournament for the championship of
the. coast will be played on the Fourth
of July, or whether it will go over until
September and be played with > the dou
bles. Ever since tennis, was started on
the coast the. singles have been played
In July, and should it be changed now
the change would probably be a perma
nent one. The question as to whether or
Bot there shall be a State championship
â¢Mirziament will also be s""*_

HE Olympic Club's bluerock shoot
I yesterday, which afforded the last
II opportunity -for .practice previous
- JJL to the annual inanimate tar
pet tournament, drew , one of
the largest, crowds of the season to the
Ingleside traps. Two bulkheads were Tcept
in continual operation. The shooting on
the whole was far above the average and
an unprecedented number of clean scores
were made. The Olympic Club's scheme
of awarding a silver bar to any one who
succeeds in grassing fifteen consecutive
birds and a gold, bar to any, one who
breaks twenty-five straight Is proving an
immense incentive.
During the day's shoot Otto Feudner se
cured six straight scores ; of fifteen tar
gets each and two straight scores of
twenty-five targents, thus winning six
silver and two gold bars. This record
has not been surpassed during the pres

chances as a trophy winner in the com'ng '.
tournament. E. Klevesahl also distin
guished himself by allowing but six birds
out. of 190 to escape beyond the range of
his gun.
Others whose work before the bulk

Besides the club shoot there were, four
special pool shoots, of which three were
fifteen-bird races, the club adding $5 to
the purse, and one a grand merchandise
shoot with twenty-five targets to each

keen rivalry and resulted In ,O. Feudner
and Klevesahl tying for first â¢. prize, with
scores of 24 each.

Henry Krug was the bad actor at Re
creation grounds yesterday afternoon,
when the Senators plucked a fourth vic
tory from the home team and made up for
past Indignities heaped upon them. Krug's
throwing and his field work were so rag
ged and wild that the crowd wished he
had gone to Philadelphia. It was clearly
an off day for Krug, who forgot to muci
lage his hands and draw hla wins in from
the skies. â¢.* /
Secramento went out In the beginning,
the very first Inning, and laid a solid
foundation for victory. A couple of hits
off Whalen and some clean errors gave
the Senators three clangs' of the bell
when the Wasps flew to the diamond dust.
After that there was no need of worry. .

St. Ives in the third round took the
course from Master Rocket, who had a
big bunch of the talent's money on him at
6 to 1.
â¢work of the talent's choice had been
clever Indeed, the game courser having
allowed but one point to be scored against
her in the previous rounds. Three to one
was the price that the wise ones offered
on Sister's chances, and In the heavy bet
ting crowd Vandal found many support
ers. In the course there was nothing for
McComb's traveler to do but to watch
her opponent make his three points and
get the decision without allowing her to
cet a credit mark.
In the next round Vandal repeated the
story to Rector, to the disappointment of
those who figured that sprinter to retire
him and had placed 2 to 1 to strengthen
their argument. This winning- gave Van
dal the right to contest* for first money
and against Ireland. Geary's chaser was
a slight favorite. When the dogs were
slipped Vandal shot ahead for a lead that
gave the backers of his opponent a lone
some feeling, and it looked that Cronin
would take down the big end. In the
work, however, Palo Alto's brother
6howed his worth, offset Vandal's speed
end won out by a score of 7 to 4.
The stake brought out some good work
by the younger coursers. Firm Fellow
ran well throughout and he came within
a point of having the honor of a final to
his credit. In the semi-final against the
stake winner McComb's good one gave
Ireland a hard rub after an undecided and
lost a close go, score 3 to 2. Rector, too,
made the semi-final by good work.

" There was a team match between ten
men from ' Battery C of the Artillery
Corps, N. G. C, and Company D of the
Fifth Infantry, N. G.C... at. Shell Mound
Park yesterday, which resulted In the de
feat of the artillery team. The scores
were made at 200, 300- and 300 yards, live
shots at each -of the ranges In the order
named. The scores were as follows:
Infantry Beats Artillery.
To-day will be the king or., eagle shoot.
The mark is a great wooden eagle so put
together that a shot planted in the proper
place .will dismember the head, a wing
or leg or cut some portion of the bird
away, and so bring a prize to the shooter.
There are twelve prizes on the bird, and
they are shot at in this order: The crown
on the bird's head, .the apple in one claw,
the scepter in the other, the ring in his
beak, the head, the neck, the right wing,
the left wing, the right leg, the left leg,
the tail and then the .body. ' The "well
placed shot In the body dismembers what
is left of the bird, and the whole thing
comes tumbling down from the pole. To
make sure that the body does not get the
shot intended for some other part of the
bird, and so bring the match to an abrupt
and premature termination, an iron plate
is fixed over the bird's vitals until the tail
has been shot off. Then Â¦ it is removed
and-whoever brings the body, down is the
king shot for the following year.. The
marksman who brings down any part of
the bird gets the prize allowed for. that
part, but all are supposed to shoot at the
different parts In their order.-
In the, bullseye shoot each shooter shot
thirty rounds and only his bullseyes were
counted. These will be measured Thurs
day night, when the prizes will be dis
tributed at California Hall, j In the shoot
the red flag-. was for a' three-Inch bullseye,
the blue'for a six-inch and 'the white for
a twelve-inch bullseye. The best scores
were: A. H. Pape," 8 red. 15 blue and 7
white: A. Strecker, 8 red, 15 blue and 6
white; A. Bremer, 8 red, 7 blue and 13

The Oakland real estate market is show
ing a decided improvement. The sales- are
not all of small properties, many big
transactions having been made of late,
showing that there is confidence among
buyers in the future of Oakland. Real es
tate dealers are beginning to try auction
sales, something that is not done unless
money is easy and buying is brisk. The
Bummer months are generally slow In
realty, but there Is more movement npw
than for many months past, which is a
good indication for the coming fall.
The sale of the De Fremery building on
Washington street, known as the Physi
cians' building, is the largest transfer that
has been made for several years. This
property was owned by James L. de
Fremery, who Is now a resident of New
York City. The name of the purchaser is
not given, but the price, $1400 a front foot,
shows that whoever he may be he has an
excellent opinion of the value of Oakland
business property. '

But a. second difficulty in our mission work
is the widespread distrust of our methods by
many of the mest active and Intelligent lay
men in the church itself. The "present method
of missionary work is a radical departure from
anything- we know in the primitive church.
We have mission boards with salaried officers.
Innumerable secretaries and treasurers and a
corps of assistants are handsomely paid. They
sit in their comfortable offices and direct the
work in the field. The missionary goes forth
with a good stipend guaranteed, a furlough
every 6even years and a warship back of him
to enforce his claim for possible Injury. These
conditions would seem to be most auspicious
as far as the missionary is concerned, but do
they produce results? I feel constrained to
answer in the negative. The day Is past
when whole nations are won to Christ through
the preaching of the missionary. If you ask
what remedy I suggest, I give It as my per
sonal opinion that we need a reduction of our
missionary machinery and a mild Infusion of
the monastic principle. We need fewer sal
aried officers and a larger number of earnest,
enthusiastic young- men. ' ready to do a sol
dier's work on a soldier's payâ free from all
ties and .willing to carry the Christian church
to the outposts, both at home and abroad.
The Catholic church " la -far ahead ef the
Protestant in this regard. Here ie her chief
strength. She. is able to utilize every force
to greatest advantage. .. Protestantism must
awaken if she is to go in and possess the land.
The greatest difficulty in the progress of
foreign missions is the inconsistency between
Christian teaching and national practice. The
missionary preaches a high standard of Chris
tian ethics, while the so-called Christian na
tions go to the Orient and uphold slavery and
countenance the opium traffic and the sale of
rum and practice just the reverse of what the
missionary has taught. I confess it Is a
tremendous obstacle and shows the immense
Importance of raising the standard of living
at home before we can hope to Impress the
heathen.
Stlil if Mark Twain's articles awaken the
Christian church to a closer study of the meth
ods of our mission work we shall hall him
as a real benefactor. A little wholesome crit
icism will certainly do our board of missions
no harm. But criticism to be of value must
approach the subject In hand with Intelligent
sympathy and a statesmanlike discrimination
of the booQ and of the weak points.
The history of foreign missions is a splendid
record of labors, sacrifices and heroisms. It
has exerted untold influence on the world for
good. The cause had produced 6uch men as
Henry Martyn. Patte6on, French of Lahore
and Harrington, the martyr of Central Africa.
These names in themselves furnish a justifi
cation for the cause they represent.
I *peak to-day on our foreign missions, be
cause it is a subject which of late has come
into prominence. There ha6 been much mis
undemanding, come Ignorance and not a lit
tle confusion, indifference .and antagonism.
The difficulties in China have brought upon
all missionary effort considerable distrust.
Part of this is merited. Part Is the outcome
of prejudice and ignorance. Mark Twaln'b
articles have gained wide hearing. Mark
Twain is a humorist. ! He occasionally says
some good things. But he is not always correct,
and any statement he makes is to be received
with caution.
ALAMEDA, May 13.â The subject of the
Rev. T. J. Lacey's sermon In Christ Epis
copal Church this morning was VThe Pop
ular Objections to Missions Considered."
This was the second of two sermons on
"Missions" delivered by the rector. They
were suggested by Mark Twain's criti
cism of the missions of China, which ap
peared recently in rhe North American
Review. Dr. Lacey spoke as follows:
Christian Nations Do Not
Practice What They
Preach.
So. Says Rev. Dr. Lacey,
Though They Agree

OAKLAND, May 19.â The Alameda
County Laundry Workers' Union last
night adopted a scale of wages that was
recently, adopted by the Sari Francisco
Union of the same line of workmen. This
scale will be presented to the : Federated
Trades on Friday night for ratification,
and will then be presented to the laundry
proprietors, who wi'l be notified that it
will go into effect on June 1. .
The main feature of the new scale of
wages is the hour clause. It provides for
not more than a ten-hour day, while it is
claimed that some of the laundries of
Oakland have bean working their em
ployes from twelve to sixteen hours. The
scale ranges from $6 to $14 a week for
regular employes and $5 for apprentices.
The average is about $7 50 or $8 a week.
The actual scale of wages is said to be but
little higher than that now prevailing, but
the increase in wages with the decrease in
hours will make an actual increase of 20
or 25 per cent.
The laundy workers have become quite
strongly organized of late. It took a long
time to perfect the organization, but it is
now very solid.

COFFEE CAUSED IT.
A Simple "Way to Locate the Cause
of Disease.
I was troubled for years with my stom-
ach, and took all sorts of remedies, with-
out being able to get well. I did not know
all this time what was the cause of the
trouble, tut since I quit drinking coffee I
found out that was the enemy that cost
me so many days and nights of suffering.
Within an hour after breakfast where
I would drink a cup of coffee, I would spit
up the meal, and If I drank coffee for sup-
prr I would go to bed and my nerves
1 witched and jerked so bady that I was
wfraid to He down.
Sometimes my stomach would flutter
terribly.
r was afraid I would have paralysis, and
I firmly believe I would If I had kept on
u.sine coffee.
I believe so much coffee drinking is the
â¢whole cause of so many dying with paral-
ysis and heart trouble.
All I can say is all this nervousness and
stomach trouble has left me since I have
been using Postum' Food Coffee according
to directions on the package, and* I know
of quite a number that have been helped
by Postum.
If people would use Postum Cereal Food
Coffee, they would save hundreds of dol-
lars in dectors' bills, and children would
be stronger and brighter If their parents
would use It instead of coffee. Of course,
it has to be made right, but that is easy.
Just let it boil fifteen or 'twenty minutes
after It really starts to boiling, and you
have a splendid drink.â Mrs. Annie Van

yehtion;. will submit majority and minority
reports to the convention to-morrow. The
majority report, - In an ;. introduction,,
quotes article 1 of the treaty of Paris, the
joint resolution of the United States Con-:
gress and the Platt amendment, and then
proceeds as follows: '-. ; - . *
- Inasmuch as Secretary Root, being author
ized by\ President McKlnley, says that the
Platt law has for its object the guaranteeing
of the independence of Cuba and does not
mean interference with Its Government, or the
exercise of a protectorate or - of sovereignty,
and also that Intervention will only take place
when independence is endangered by outside
powers or grave interior, disturbances, creat
ing anarchy; and. inasmuch as Secretary Root
has said that " "the naval stations will -not be
used as vantage points of intervention, but
only to protect Cuba against foreign powers,
we report as follows: .
.. That, iln virtue of the fact that the Platt
law. In its. preamble, says it is a fulfillment
of the Joint resolution and : has been adopted
by Congress with the principal object of es
tablishing indepepdence, we do propose to .the
convention Â¦ to accept the following as an ap
pendix to the constitution." .' Â¦ : .
Bight of Intervention; '
The iflrst, ' second;' 'fourth and '" fifth
clauses are quoted in their entirety. The
third- clause has the following addition: \
It being understood that the United States
has the right to intervene to prevent '.the ac->
tlon of a foreign power or disturbances cans
ing a state of anarchy arid that the interven
tion shall always be the .act of the United
States and not of isolated agents, the in
tervention shall suppose neither sovereignty,
nor a protectorate and shall only last suffi
ciently long to' establish moral conditions
Said intervention, it is also understood, shall
not have the right to interfere In the govern
ment, but only the right to preserve Inde
pendence. ' , , - ' - - 'Â¦
An addition to the sixth clause says that i
the' ownership of the Isle. of Pines shall
be settled by. a future treaty. Â¦ " .
-. An addition to the seventh clause says:
' It shall be -understood -that ; the naval sta
tions do "not give the United States the right
to interfere with the interior government, but.
are established for the sole purpose of pro
tecting American waters from, foreign in
vasion directed against Cuba or the United
States. Cuba will sell or lease the necessary
landf' at points to be agreed upon later. .-
An addition to the eighth clause says,
that the government of Cuba suggests at
the same time a treaty Â¦ of - commerce :
based upon reciprocity. Â¦â¢Â¦â¢.Â¦
â¢ View of the Minority. ',
i| The minority" report says: . >
Â¦ The explan'atlens given to. the commission at.
"Washington show that the Platt law -does; not
express the wishes of the United States. It
was intended to protect the independence of
Cuba., but the wording gives other interpreta-
The United States is inconsistent In asking
naval stations when the amendment provides
that no concessions shall be. given to foreig-n
powers. Such a demand raises the question
whether the United States does not consider
Cuba a part of her possessions. ,
The report of tlie minority virtually ac
cepts the first and second clauses. I"or
the third clause the folio wine is. substi
tuted: . " :
That the Government of Cuba subscribes to
the Monroe doctrine and will help the United
States to enforce it against other, nations try
ing to Violate". It.' ...;:Â¦'.Â¦;Â¦
% -For the j clause "the 'following Is
substituted: , ; . '- . Â¦ : Â¦â¢'Â¦-- ' ;
Cuba does not recognize acts of Intervention
whicfr are not in conformity with the- Foraker
resolution and the laws of the United States.
;: The seventh clause- reads: ,,. ....; ''.. â¢
Cuba will maintain naval stations, handing
Â¦them over to the. United 'States in time of
The report of the minority recommends
a' commercial treaty based .upon reap-,
rocity. Â¦'Â¦.'. '.-....:
Majority's Action Unexpected.
The -report of the majority â¢ has .caused
considerable surprise. It was generally
believed that the committee on relations
would recommend acceptance of the Platt,
amendment on the basis of the interpre
tation given by Secretary Root, but it was.
not expected" that such" additions would be
made to various clauses as the majority
recommends. *

LOSS OF EBB LOVES
â¢ CAUSES THE SUICIDE
San Jose Coroner Discovers the Rea
son Why Miss Whittle ,
Killed Herself. ,
SAN JOSE, May. 19. â Because of a quar
rel and the idle taunt of her lover that he
was a married man, Lola Whittle, a wait
ress, swallowed a. dose of strychnine yes
terday and killed' herself. The cause. of
her self-destruction was >' ascertained at
the inquest to-day.
For over a year the girl and Leonard
Campbell, a railroad man, had kept com-,
pany, and their affection had led 'to an
engagement. .. Several times the young
people had quarreled. When Miss Whittle
was sent for by her father, who is a doc
tor in South America, she wanted Camp
bell to accompany her. This he declined,
to do, and yesterday afternoon they quar
reled again. This time he is said to have
told her he was a married man and could
have nothing more to do with her. She in
quired of several persons if this was so,
and receiving no definite answer*; went
home and took the poison. A verdict was
rendered that the girl died from an "over
dose of strychnie taken while temporarily
insane." . Â¦ ; .

The *third annual Henry- Miller season
will be inaugurated to-night at the Co
lumbia Theater with a fine revival of the
romantic drama "Heartsease," a play of
great popularity in this city. In which
Henry Miller has made" a most pronounced
impression by Â¦ his excellent performance
in the role of. Eric Temple. The play is
of the costume order, and the dressing of
the various characters is quite picturesque
and elaborate. Some unusually fine stage
settings are promised. The play will be
given every night this week. Matinees
during the Miller season will be given on
Wednesdays and Saturdays.
Among the principals of Mr. Miller's
company this season Is pretty Grace El-
Uston, who will ;be remembered here for

pÂ»TTp^HE English Grand Opera Com-
I pany, formerly under the manage
1 ment of Grau & Savage, has given
IL this weeks' Orpheum bill one very
bright and extremely particular
star. The Grau-Savage idea was a big
one, but too big for present conditions,
and after a brilliant flight the English
Grand Opera Company was disbanded.
Grace Van Studdiford was one of its chief
reasons for existence. When it ceased to
be Miss Van Studdiford stepped' on the
vaudeville stage, and now not all the
Grau ducats and all the Grau pull would
take her away from the new field into
which their withdrawal in a manner
forced her. She is a Western girl, and has
to her credit one of the swiftest trips to
popular favor the New York stage ever
saw. She is handsome, has a magnificent
voice and plenty of dramatic ability, and
knows how to make friends of her audi
ences.

It was cold and windy out. by the beach
yesterday. During the afternoon Senator
McMillan and party \ visited the Cliff

other attractions.
Owing to the condition of the weather
the crowds at the â¢ park and " beach were
small. There were no i serious accidents
reported. -A. W. Young, who resides at
the Winchester House, was knocked down
by a "scorcher" and suffered a painful
laceration of the scalp. Thomas Flynn, a
steamfltter,' got mixed up in a flgnt at the
beach and .was taken to jail on a charge
of battery. .
'The crowd at the Chutes was asÂ«larsre

Everybody's Business.
In yesterday's Chronicle there appeared
an article in reference to the deaj in shoes
that I have made. Will add, that this is
by all means the largest deal that was
ever made at one time by any house In
San Francisco. The shoe clerks, of which
there are twenty, have been busy since
last Thursday in placing the goods for the
opening sale, and hope to be all ready by
Thursday. This large and. valuable stock
will have to be disposed of within four
weeks. I will therefore sacrifice this beau
tiful stock for 35 cents on every dollar's
worth of goods. No one need be bashful
to attend this sale. Take a pair of shoes
home; if not satisfactory, come back and
your money will be returned to you will
ingly. This shall be. a genuine factory
shoe sale, to take place at the Bee Hive
Shoe Co., 717 Market street, near Third.

SING I2T THE CHORUS,
Â»i"H kxt SEEK 'i'n ura PAY
Boys of Columbia Minstrel Compajiy
Looking for the Man Wio Has
the Money.
There was an incipient riot at the box
office of the Alhambra Theater last night
when the thirty . chorus boys who have
been singing with the Columbia Minstrels
there for the last j week or more called to
get their pay. There was due to each boy
$2.50, but they found the box-office locked
and dark and no one around to explain or
to pay.
According to the story of the boys they
were hired on May 8 to open with the min
strels on May 11 and to sing in the chorus
for four nights, or until the 14th. For this
they were to get $1 apiece. "When the 14th
came around the contract^was extended
to the night of the 18th and the wage was
raised to $2. payable at the end of the per
formance on the night of the 18th. When
the 18th came around, however, another
day was tacked on with two performances
and 50 cents was added to each boy's sal
ary, which was payable after the perform
ance- last nisht. -
The boys say they went -around to the
box-office last night and found only a man
who swore at them, i The company has
finished its run at the Alhambra, but it
will give a performance at the Odd Fel
lows' Hall some time this week, and the
boys are going after the box receipt* oi
that occasion.

The grand worthy officers and the vis
iting delegates were the guests of honor,
and were once more made to realize the
breadth of Californian hospitality. Special
preparations for the event had been made
at the park and many of the buildings
xrere prettily decorated. The majority of
the guests gave themselves up to the
pleasures of the dance, but many sought
recreation in exploring the grounds or
congregating In small parties in the
grove. Several hundred dollars' worth of
gate and athletic prizes were given away.
Races were held for boys, girls, young
men, voung ladies, fat men, married la
dies, sxand officers, committee men.

Chairman Dunn of the arrangements com
mittee- banqueted his assistants and the
grand officers at a downtown restaurant,
where many informal toasts were re
sponded to. A beautiful souvenir pro
gramme was given to all the guests at the
picnic. It contained, besides much pleas

photographs of all the leading past and
present grand officers and prominent
members.
About $2000 was realized from the picnic
and this will be devoted to the building

The committees In charge of the affair
were as follows:
Delegates to the Grand Aerie of the Fra

Schuetzen Park given under the auspiecs
of local Aerie No. 5 yesterday. More than
2000 Eagles and invited friends were pres

one of the most pleasant of all the en
joyable entertainments of the session. The
Uklah was chartered for the use of the
guests during the day, and special trains

John T. M. Glootz, 60 years of age. was
found dead in a room in the Ahlborn
House, Bush andDupont streets, yesterday
morning by a bedmaker. The latter no
ticed the odor of gas. and forcing open the
door, found the body of the old man on
the bed. He had turned on the gas.
Glootz had pasted paper on the casing
p round the door and had stuffed the key
hole, showing that he had determined to
commit suicide. The body was removed
to the Mcrgue.
The old man left a note, which read: "I
am going to Augusta. John and Amelia.
Good-by." He enpaged a room at the Ahl
born House last Thursday. The family re
sides at 255 Thirtieth street, and a son,
who called at the Morgue, said he expect

At Turn Verein Hall last night an ex
cellent programme, consisting of both mu
sical and athletic numbers, was given by
th" San Francisco Turn Verein to raise a
sufficient amount of money to enable it
to send its prize class to San Diego to par
ticipate in the "turnfest," in which all
Turner societies of the Pacific Coast will
meet in competition from June 21 to 24.
Financially the affair was a success, the
attendance being large. Quite a sum of
money was realized from prize games,
which were liberally patronized. This sum.
together with the money realized from
tUÂ« 6S.le of tickets, will enable" the Turn
ers to send their prize class off In good

.Had it not been for the thoughtfulness
of Police Officer Skein a young woman
named Belle Schneider/ wrongfully \ ac
cused of grrand larceny, would now be oc
cupying a cell in the City Prison.'
Â¦ Saturday night . William Myrick. Â¦ living
at 231 Third street, visited a dance hall on
Pacific' street, intending to'have a "good
time," as he expressed it. After buying
liquid refreshments for 8 the young wo
man he started to leave, when he discov
ered, as he thought, that his watch, chain
and a diamond locket were gone. Meeting
Policeman Skein he told him of his sup
posed loss and accused the woman of hav
ing stolen his jewelry. Skein, thinking he
was tellins the truth, went to the danco
hall and took the woman into custody.
Accompanied by Myrick the officer took
Miss Schneider 'to the Central Police Sta
tion and turned her over to Lieutenant
Birdsall. Amid tears she declared that
she knew nothing about the supposed dis
appearance of Myrick's property. Myrick
was equally as emphatic in stating that
she had robbed him and his story was
corroborated by two friends who accom
panied him to the dance hall.
To convince the lieutenant that he had
been robbed Myrick turned his pockets
inside out, but the watch did not materi
alize. . . â¢ -, . Â¦-,!-..
As Myrick was clamoring for the wo
man's arrest Lieutenant Birdsall' was
about to order her locked up when Police
man Skein, suspecting that the story of
the robbery was untrue, started to thor
oughly search Myrick. Passing his hand
down the trousers of his left leg he dis
covered the watch hidden in the man's
stocking. Myrick tried to appear sur
prised, but the attempt was a dismal fail
ure.. Not content with finding the time
piece the officer added to the discomfiture
of the woman'3 accuser by fishing . the
chain and locket out of the right leg of
his trousers. Myrick, now thoroughly
abashed, was ordered out of the station.
The woman was at once released.
