PRINCESS HATZFELDT PREPARES TO CONTEST
WILL OF COLLIS P. HUNTINGTON, AND VISITS
COAST TO GATHER EVIDENCE OF ADOPTION
THE Princess Clara von Hatzfeldt
and her titled husband arrived
most unexpectedly Sunday, and
The Call made exclusive an
nouncement of their coming and
the mystery which surrounded their
movements. The Call is able now to an
nounce that the purpose of this visit of
the foster-daughter of Collis P. Hunting
ton and the Prince von Hatzfeldt is noth
ing less than to gather evidence upon
which to base a contest of the will of the
railway magnate.
The Princess is now in Sacramento with
her mother, Mrs. Prentice, and the Prince
has made various explanations of her ab
sence, to some inquirers saying she had
gone to Burllngame and to others that
she had gone driving. The Prince refuses
to discuss the proposed will contest and
says the news will be given out to all the
papers in due time.
The purpose of the visit of the Princess
von Hatzfeldt to Sacramento is to pro
cure if possible documentary evidence of
her adoption by Collis P. Huntington. and
if documentary evidence is not procurable
Bhe will seek cumulative evidence that
Huntington regarded her as his adopted
daughter and let It be generally under
stood that he had legally adopted her.
Arrivals Many and Mysterious.
Joseph Redditg, attorney for the Von
Hatzfeldts, came out from New York
early last week and established himself
at the Bohemian Club. His coming also
was unheralded, and his visit vas appar
ently without serious or important pur
pose. But when^his clients reached Cal
ifornia he knew of their coming and went
"up the road" to meet them and accom
panied them back to San Francisco. Yes
terday he was in frequent consultation
with the Prince and the two were in com-
The Prince's eagerness to keep secret
the fact that the Princess was in Sacra
mento is further shown by his statements
to other inquirers that she had merely
gone out driving and would be in later in
the day. The Prince also stated that their
stay in San Francisco would be very
short, only a few days, in fact,, and that
their return would be via the Canadian
route. In spite of this the apartments at
the Palace are engaged for an indefinite
time and "their stay will be gauged by the
slipped into San Francisco and went to
apartments at th\ Palace Hotel and none
knew that the great hotel sheltered them.
Yesterday morning, as the result of The
Call's exclusive announcement of their
presence, many cards were sent up and
representatives of all the newspapers
sought Interviews with both the Princess
and her titled husband. Tlie Prince him
self granted interviews and explained that
his wife had gone to San Mateo for a few
days' rest. He and the Princess had come
to California, he said,* merely for a short
pleasure trip. His reticence and his fre
quent and protracted consultations with
his attorney did not serve to lend force
to his explanation of the purpose of the
visit to the land of his wife's hjrth.

W. "W. Doneghy. Helen Barnes, Julia
Howie, Belle Smith, Isabelle McDonald
and Mrs. C. E. "Wilcox were arrested last
evening by Detectives Wren and Dinan
on warrants issued on the complaint of
Charles A. Smith, assistant cashier of the
Columbian Banking Company, who last
week purchased some of the benefit tick
ets of the bogus* "California Boys' and
Girls* Aid Society."
Harry Mamlock, the sleek operator,
who was one of the prime movers In de
frauding the public on the fake concert
scheme, disappeared from the city on
Sunday night. The police searched the
tenderloin for him last night, but without
success. Mamlock did not even take any
of his clothing or effects with him, but
left all his belongings in the room he oc
cupied In a boarding-house at the corner
of Post and Leavenworth streets.
. The reluctance of some of the dupes of
the band of "charity workers" to come
forward and swear to a complaint opened
a way for MamloA to slip through the
fingers of the police. -The swindler was
detained In custody at the Hall of Jus
tice for two hours on Sunday, but Cap
tain Seymour set him at liberty, as It was
impossible to secure a complaint charg
ing fraud.
Cashier Smith Swears to Complaint.
Yesterday afternoon Cashier Smith of
the Columbian Banking Company was
willing to do his duty as a citizen, and by
swearing to a complaint set in motion the
machinery of the law calculated to ef
fectually end the work of the charity
fakers and swindlers and at the same
time protect the charitable public.
After the complaint of Cashier Smith
had been sworn to before Police Judge
A. J. Fritz the - warra nts were signed by
his Honor, and Assistant District Attor
neys Perry and Burke soon had the doc
uments in proper order. Eight warrants
were issued by Judge Fritz.
As soon as the warrants had been hand
ed over to Chief of Detectives Seymour
that official set his force at" work to bring
In the accused parties.
Detectives "Wren and Dlnan proceeded
to room 612, Emma Spreckels building,
where Doneghy, Helen Barnes and the
rest of his - outfit have been located for the
last three weeks. Entering the room the
detectives found Doneghy, Miss Barnes
and a few other persons there. The of
ficers of the law wasted no time, but
quickly placed Doneghy and the woman
under arrest. The warrants were read to
them, and when Helen Barnes desired to
know who Charles A- Smith was, who
had sworn to the complaints, the detec
tives replied that they did not know,
which was the truth.
The arrested persons were taken to the
Hall of Justice and kept in the detectives*
room until the rest of those wanted could
be found. At the boarding-house on Post
and Leavenworth streets the detectives
located Julie Howie, Belle Smith and Mrs.
C. E. "Wilcox. The women took their ar
rest with coolness and only asked for a
chance to "fix their hair."
Mamlock Makes His Escape. *
The room in the house which Mamlock
occupied, adjoining that of his three wo
men accomplices, was then visited by tha
detectives, but Mamlock was missing.
Inquiries made of the three arrested
women led to answers that they had not
seen Mamlock since Sunday evening at
dinner, and the servants in the house In
formed the police that his room had not
been occupied on Sunday night.
The second batch of arrested charity
schemers was taken to police headquar
ters, â¢ and, with Doneghy and Helen
Barnes, were booked on the charge of
conspiracy to obtain money by false pre
tenses.
Doneghy gave his occupation as a "con
cert promoter," residence New York;
Helen Barnes was booked as of "no oc
cupation." residence New York; Julie
Howie stated that she was a milliner of
Los Angeles; Mrs. C. E. "Wllcox was book
ed as a "trained nurse," also of Los An
geles, and Belle Smith gave her residence
as Santa Barbara.
. The police were unable to locate Miss
Detweiler, one of the schemes, who came
from the East with Doneghy. Isabelle"*"
McDonald was arrested late at night by
Detective Hamill and locked up.
Judge Fritz, ift issuing the warrants,
was so impressed with the seriousness of
the offense charged that he fixed the bail
in each case at $1000 bonds or 1300 cash.
None of the schemers were able last night
to secure bail and they spent the % night
behind prison bars.
Conspiracy to Defraud.
The. Penal Code of the State of Califor
nia makes it a misdemeanor for persons
to - conspire for â¢ the purpose of obtaining

THE members of the House Com
mittee on Rivers and Harbors who
have been In California for several
days examining into the needs of
\ the waterways of the State are ex
i .ttefl to arrive in San Francisco this af
ternoon. Their mission is of vast Impor
tance to California, and every effort will
be made by the public-spirited citizens of
this city, as well as of other cities in the
State, to fa.cIUU.te the gathering: of infor
mation by the Congressional investigators
that will enable them to formulate a. com
prehensive report on the subject that will.
It is hoped, result in an adequate appropri
ation by the next Congress for this impor
tant work.
Members of California's Congressional
delegation have in interviews given clean
cut and logical expositions of the condi
tions that now exist and the necessity of
Congressional aid in the development of
the wonderful resources of the State they
represent. Their statements are support
ed by statistics, and they stand ready to
point out and explain facts to the mem
bers of the committee that can hardly fail
to impress them that the commercial
greatness of this city and State will be
gTeatly enhanced by favorable Congres
sional action for the betterment of Call>
f ornia's rivers and harbors. *
Senator George C. Perkins, Congressmen
Mctcalf, Woods, Kahn and Coombs give
valuable Information on the subject, and
Irving M. Scott takes a broad view of the
scope that Intelligent harbor improvement
may take, dealing with matters within
end beyond the authority of Congress.
To Be Received by Business Men.
The members of the committee will be
received on their arrival here by repre
tentatlves of the commercial bodies of
this city, including such men as William
2X. Bunker of the Chamber of Commerce;
Thomas J. Parsons of the Board of Trade:
A. Sbarboro of the Manufacturers* and
Producers' Association: Moses Greene
baura. of the Merchants' Association: N.
P. Chiprnan of the California State'Board
of Trade, and George E. Plummer of the
committee on commerce.
The Congressmen will first visit Oakland
and consider the needs of that city. Next
they will view the bay of San Francisco
and will visit Vallejo and Napa. Then
they â¢will g-o to Stockton. Everywhere
they will receive a California welcome,
which was presaged by the imitations
eent out by the California Legislature
and by the commercial bodies. A pro
gramme of entertainment has been pre
pared by the commercial committee, of
which William M. Eunker 1b the chair
man. In the various cities to be visited
local committees have arranged to make
the visit of the Congressmen pleasant and
Instructive.
The members of the Congressional com
mittee are accompanied by members of
their families and friends. The party
includes:
Theodore E. Burton, chairman of the com
mittee; Mr. and Mrs. Walter Reeves. Roswell
P. Bishop and eon, Mr. and lire. Ernest F.
Acheson. Mr. and Mrs. Page Morris, Mr. and
Mrt. Â«ie AJva Alexander. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas
H. Tongue and daughter. Mr. and Mrs. George

Mrs. Thomas H. Ball, Mr. Hills, secretary of
tfce committee; Frank H. Hitchcock, chief of
the Bureau of Foreign Markets of the Depart
ment of Agriculture; Mr. Henche, stenographer,
end Mrs. Henche; Mr. Crist, messenger.
The visit of the Congressmen is recog
nized in all quarters as being Important
and significant. The distinguished mem
bers of the House of Representatives are
traveling thousands of miles In search of
information, which will be gladly given.
They come to the Pacific Coast to see
personally the rivers and harbors and to
consider the needs of the people which
can be met by Congress. Their journey
Is unique In American history. As Con
gressman Metcalf says In an interview:
In the history of the American
Congress it is the first time that a
great committee has traveled thou
sands of miles to personally inspect
and inquire into the needs and possi-
tilities of our State in the all-im
portant matter of our rivers and har
bor improvements. They are here by
the special invitation of the-Legisla
ture of this State and the various
commercial bodies of California, pre
sented by the united California dele
gation in both Houses of Congress,
end they come without any appropri-
ft tion by Congress to meet -the ex-
pense of the trip.
The Fifty-sixth Congress failed to pass
a river and harbor bill owing to well un
derstood causes. The question of the util
ization cf rivers that are not navigable
for the purpose of irrigating arid lands
was coupled with the improvement of
navigation, and the bill failed. California
was very largely interested. The facts
are bo well understood in the several lo-
ragresslonal Investigators. Are Ex

Prince Not * Ready . to Talk.
Prince Hatzfeldt spent a very busy time
yesterday. After seeing his wife, the
Princess, off on the 10 o'clock train for
Sacramento, he visited the Crocker build
ing and had a lengthy conference with
Joseph Redding,- his attorney. After
lunch he paid another visit to Redding's
office, accompanied by his friend, Mons.
F.M. Guedalla, who is visiting the coast
in the Prince's party. He then went back
to the Palace Hotel and ordered a vic
toria to take him for a drive .through
Golden Gate Park. While waiting the ar
rival of the vehicle the Prince was inter
viewed by a Call, reporter.
"The Printass has gone out of town
alone, has she not?" was asked^
"Yes. She will be away for a day or
so," the Prince replied.
"She went to Sacramento, did she not?"
"Where she went I would prefer not to
say,", he replied.' ' . -
The Prince was showing signs of un
easiness.
, "Is it not a fact that the Princess is
going to contest the will of the late C.
P. Huntington?" '
. "I have nothing to say at all about the
matter at present," he answered. "When
the proper time comes I will send" for all
the newspaper men and state what I
want to tell them. I want to treat you
all alike, but I i am not ready to talk
yet."
The. vehicle was waiting and the Prince
entered the carriage, accompanied by his
friend Guedalla, * the latter adjusting his
monocle before giving the driver the
word to start.

W. H. Mills, too, who knows more
about the estate of the late Collis P.
Huntington than any other man Â¦ living,
arrived Saturday from the Pan-American
Exposition, and, after spending Sunday
at San Mateo, came up yesterday and is
now at his residence on Jackson street.
His arrival simultaneously with the com
ing of the Hatzfeldts and their attorney
is regarded as more than a mere coinci
dence.
H. E. Huntington also, is on the coast.
His arrival was recent, and he is now at
Los Angeles. "He and Mrs. Arabella D.
Huntington. the widow, are the principal
beneficiaries under his -uncle's will, they
receiving all the estate except legacies
amounting to v t2.465,000. He had knpwl
edge of the dissatisfaction of the Von
Hatzfeldts with the will and their con
templated contest, and his presence, at
the temporary scene of action is most
probably more than the result of "for
tunate accident.. * â¢_ . ...
fection for her had often been demon
strated. 1 But when his will was filed for
probate it was found that: she was treated
as a foster-child only and was given but

that legacy was placed in trust.

The Von Hatzfeldts have never shown

closed, and they cannot cross" its thresh

stay here at a public hotel.
Estrangement of Sisters.
Mrs. H. E., Huntington and the Princess
von Hatzfeldt are sisters, but It is known
that they are estranged and that. the bit
terness between them and their husbands
will lend itself to the contest of the will.
It is said that" the Princess has asserted
that she knows nothing of such a sister.
Not until the death of Collis P. Hunt
ington did it become known that the Prin
cess von Hatzf eldt, so" far as documentary
evidence was concerned, was not the
adopted daughter, of the railroad builder.
It had been ~ generally, supposed that , his

Tammany and .the well-known facility
wi th which the New -York j courts dispose
of contests of wills 'Â¦ \ brought on \ shaky
grounds were potent reasons why this at
torney, refused to become connected with
the suit. It is his .belief, and other at
torneys â¢ hold the same opinion, that if
possible "the. Princess will bring some
legal action here that will establish the
fact of her adoption and strengthen her
claim to a ' share of the estate. After
such a skirmish only, they hold, will the
contest in the New York courts begin.
A well-known attorney, who was on in
timate terms with * Huntington, pointed
out ; last night that .; the 'arrivals of so
many interested parties followed close
upon the heels of the appointment of ap
praisers for the small portion of the es
tate' which, is In California. He gave It
as his opinion that it would be found.ul
timately that ;the lots in San Francisco,
Oakland 'and Santa Monica, and the Santa
Monica ranch, which have been supposed
to constitute Huntlngton's holdings ; in
California, had been deeded to Mrs! Hunt
ington, as well as the Nob Hill mansion.
Hope of Compromise ,an Incentive.
The value of the estate was estimated
at the time of Huntlngton's death at $35,
000,000... It has ; recently been appraised at
about $70,000,000, exclusive of the small
California holdings. The Southern Pacific
stock^ of ; which the estate had .600,000
sharesVwas sold to the Harriman syndi
cate, according to H. E. Huntington in an
interview in The Call since his arrival in
San Francisco, for $33,000,000.
-This marvelous increase in value doubt
less has encouraged Princess Hatzfeldt
to make an attack upon the will, In con
fidence that' even if she cannot break it
she can af least keep the. estate' tied up
in .'probate for years .unless ;the fear of
great loss, in the varied interests of the
colossal estate should be incentive enough,
to cause a compromise. A proportionate
share, even, ,of the increased value would
be -well worth the bluff of .a will contest.

her diversified. Interests, and especially
the commerce of our ports and the great
natural waterways in the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys, which will enable
the farmers of that great empire to trans

the Senator. "The California delegation
was successful In embodying the most of
them in our bill for the improvement of
rivers and harbors, which failed to be

It was generally understood at that time

The opinion Is entertained among the
Courthouse officials that if the adoption
actually took place In this county it
may have been In chambers, in which
case It was as likely as not that no rec
ord of it was entered by the Judge who
confirmed it. This possibility evidently
was not lost sight of by the agent from
San Francisco, who not only searched all
the archives for documents, but narrow
ly scrutinized the minute-books of the Su
perior Judges covering Che period in ques
tion.
The search of the Sacramento County
records to which reference is- made oc
curred early In September, shortly after
Huntington's death. Men close up In the
Southern Pacific had first quietly conduct
ed incuiries and then an agent came up
from San Francisco to institute a search
It is recalled now that this man did not
state his name, nor would he state his
object further than that he was looking
for certain adoption papers in an estate
â¢whose name he declined to mention. Even
the deputies â¢ in the County Clerk's and
Recorder's offices were unable to divine
his errand. He kept up the search. for a
week, but no record of the adoption of
Clara Prentice by the railroad magnate
was discovered.
Mysterious Searcher.
The opinions of. various persons were
obtained, and some of these, were to the
effect that no formal adoption, as now
provided for by law, had been made, and
that therefore there could be no such doc
ument on file. Others, however, asserted
that such a document was In existence
and that it might be found had not the
imperfect system of Indexing In vogue by
county officials at that time made the
search difficult. Mrs. Clara Prentice, the
mother of the Princess, declared that she
signed papers relinquishing her claim to
her daughter end that the. adoption was
properly put on record. She expressed the
opinion, when Interviewed at the time,
that the record was In New York, as the
adoption did not take place until Mr.
Huntington and his first wife, who was a
sister of Mrs. Prentice, went to New York
to live. !
The presence of the Princess in Sacra
mento revives interest In the fact that
shortly after the death of C. P. Hunting
ton a search was made through the musty
archives of the county by some one repre
senting the Huntington interests for a
record of the formal adoption of the
Princess by Huntington, but though the
search was vigorously carried on, the doc
ument could not be found.
SACRAMENTO, June 17. â Princess
Hatzfeldt Is visiting her aged mother,
Mrs. Clara Prentice, at Fourteenth and
L streets, in this city. To callers this
evening she said that Â» she was here
merely on a pleasure trip, and that after
a few days' rest here, her Old home, she
would rejoin her husband. She avoided
reference, to private matters connected
with her journey, if such exist.
Former Searches After Adoption
Papers Recalled by Presence
of Princess.
VISIT TO SACRAMENTO.
"Often when I have ' In the Hunt
ington house or when they came to mjr
house ' Mrs. 'Â¦' Huntington spoke of the
Princess as 'My daughter Clara.' Mr.
Huntington also spoke of the young girl
in the same way. * Huntington never told
me that he had adopted the child, but
everybody in those days was under that
impression.
"I do not know if Huntington did ever
draw up a legal document of adoption,
but If the Princess can produce any such
paper I Imagine that the courts will
recognize Its weight and a different: dis
tribution of the estate might be made. A
peculiar feature of the will of C. P. Hunt
ington is that in it he left to Archie Hunt
ington. his adopted son, $250,000. It is the
general opinion that he was not left a
larger sum in order Â¦ that in pro
bating the > will the collateral in
heritance â¢ tax could be , evaded.
Archie Huntington is the son of Mrs. C.
P. Huntington and In making his will he
evidently thought that Mrs. Huntington
â¢vould well look after her own son at all
times. .
"Mrs. H. E. Huntington and the
Princess are sisters and their maiden
names were Prentice. After the Princess
was married she lived abroad nearly all
the time. It Is about three years
since her last visit to this city. I think
that the Prince and Princess are here on
some business, but I have not seem them
and do not know the nature of It."
Estate's Increase in Value.
Mills admits that he is here on inroort
ant business, and the wise ones shake
their heads and suggest that he is called
here in connection with the case. One
thing is certain, and that is that no one
outside the Huntington family Is able, to
give a better statement of the situation
than he. . ..,-.....
"I know that Princess Hatzfeldt is dis
satisfied with -he terms of the late C. P.
Huntington's will," he said. "She Is going
to take some legal action, but what it is
I do not know. You may not possibly be
aware of the fact that since C..P. Hunt
ington u!ed hi? estate has increased in
value fully 40 per cent." - -
"Do you think that Huntington legally
adopted the Princess?" he was asked.
"He may have, and he may not. That
is the best way I can answer the ques
tion," he replied. "When the Princess
was a mere' infant she was taken by C.
P. Huntington and his wife and raised as
their child. The Princess was a niece of
his former wife. The child was taken
from a large family and taken into their
home, as Huntington had no children.
The Princess was raised and taught to
call Mrs. Huntington mother, and her
real mother she was told to call aunt.
She grew up in the belief that Collis P.
Huntington was her real father, and was
not told the real truth until she was about
18 years old."

Oakland, Port Costa, Vallejo " and Stockton in Pressing ; NeedâGreat
Importance of More Sea Room at Mare Island Is Strongly Set Forth
"Oakland harbor already has the largest
yards for the building of wooden ships
on San Francisco Bay, and these ship
yards are turning out yearly an aggregate
tonnage larger than all other shipyards
on the shores of San Francisco Bay com
bined. The largest sailing vessels ever
built on the shores of San Francisco Bay
have been . launched from Oakland ship
yards. The coal bunkers in Oakland har
bor are among. the largest in the State.
"Along the water front of Oakland be
sides the shipyards are numerous and
large factories.. comprising cotton and jute
mills, foundries, machine, shops, planing
mills, flour mills, sash and door factories,
railroad shops, numerous large lumber
yards and a variety of other Industries.
With the further improvement of the har
bor all these will increase in number and
importance." , . -
"Moreover, during the years since- the
adoption of these plans a great change
has taken place in the size and construc
tion of ships; they are larger and draw
more water, and thus the Improvements
then contemplated are quite Inadequate to
present conditions, to say nothing of 'those
which will soon exist from the tre
mendous increase of Pacific commerce.
Oakland harbor offers possibilities for one
of the best harbors m the world, and I
am confident that to be convinced of this
the committee will need but- to inspect It.
It contains no rocks or any obstruction of
any kind which cannot be readily removed
by ordinary dredging. It is an Ideal har
bor for ship-building, repairing and dry
docks. Its entrance is only six miles from
the open sea. , â¢â¢
"The Importance of the improvement of
Oakland harbor, Its widening-, deepening
and extending, â¢ has already been recog
nized by the general Government, and
large sums of money have been appro
priated and expended thereon. As far
back as 1873 a beard of officers was con
stituted to make the examination, survey
and plans for Oakland harbor, In accord
ance with the provisions of an act of
Congress approved March 3, 1873. The
plans prepared were adopted in 1874, and
the work of improvement was placed In
charge of Colonel Mendell. Congress has
continued to make appropriations from
time to time since then aggregating $2,
450,000. It must not be forgotten, how
ever," that since the adoption of plans for
this harbor improvement, twenty-seven
years ago, the commerce of Oakland has
grown to a magnitude which could not at
that time, have been imagined by the
most sanguine. In 1874 the freight ton
nage amounted to 154,300 tons; in 1900 it
amounted to 3,263,212 tons, a twenty-fold
increase.
Harbor of Oakland.
"I would also call attention to the great
benefit to bÂ« derived from deepening the
channel between Antloch and the Straits
of Carquinez. This improvement would
not cost to exceed $25,000 and would en
able deep water vessels to land at Antioch
and open up to deep water commerce an
immensely productive and fertile region
of country.
By dredging the channel at Pinole
Point and removing Commission
Bock from the Mare Island Channel;
the largest battleship could be taken
to the yard for repairs r^and this 'would
result in hundreds of thousands of
dollars being paidV.but. annually in
this State by the Government for ad
ditional labor and material. At the
present time all' the battleships are
taken to the Bremerton Station at
Puget Sound to be docked and re
paired, but with the improvements
above referred to they could, and
would, be all repaired at Mare
Island Navy Yard.
Herbert .W. Bowen, who becomes the
new Minister to Venezuela, has a most
creditable -Â¦Â¦ record in the consular and
diplomatic service. He became United
States Consul at Barcelona in 1890, and
his office at that post was raised to the
rank of Consul General five years af
terward. Mr. Bowen stuck to his post
through the exciting days preceding the
Spanish-American war as long as any
American could have found safety on
Spanish soil. At the conclusion of the
war he was about to return to his old
post, but instead was appointed Minister

The change, so far as It concerns the i
Venezuelan Ministry, it is said at the State
Department to have no particular sig

than Caracas at his own request and de

with Mr. Loomis in more ways than one,

gates the word was immediately passed
along the line. Whatever may be the .
plans of the strikers." to meet the new :
condition of affairs they asserted at their .
headquarters. this afternoon that no vio
lence was intended. Â¦ â¢ ]
Matters were more complicated, at 3:15 '
o'clock this afternoon by a mysterious \
tire, discovered in a pile of garbage on Â¦
the wnarf at Moran's. The nre depart- :
ment made a quick run and extinguished 'Â¦
tae biaze before it had done damage of ]
consequence. This incident has fanned 'Â¦
gossip, and, despite the fact that no
statements have Deen given out to lay ,
ti.e blame of the nre in any particular
direction, considerable feeling has been Â¦
aroused. ,
Non-Union Men at Work.
Up to this time the differences of opin
ion between the striking machinists and
the company has been argued in a peace
able manner. It appears, however, that
the Morans have secured non-union men
from Portland and San Francisco to take
the places of the strikers. They started
up 10-day with fully seventy-rive car
penters and sixty machinists. William
Moran of the company to-day stated that
more non-union mechanics would" be put I
to work every day trom now on and tnat
in a short time it was expected that the
big plant would be running as usual. The
non-union mechanics are working ten
hours a day at the old scale of wages,
which averages ?3 50 a day for workmen
in the metal-working line.
At the company's offices it was stated
that applications for employment from
non-union machinists are being received
dally and that there would be no diffi
culty in obtaining a complete working
force in time. The non-union men come
from San Francisco, 1'ortland and from
various points in the East. So quietly
were the oreparations for the resumption
of work conducted that very few people
knew to-day that a non-union crew had
been put to work. No statement could be
obtained regarding the attitude of the
strikers' committee save that the com
mittee would not attempt to interfere
with the men.
Work in the machine, bollermaklng and
molding departments of every large metal
working plant in the city has been sus
pended plnce May 20, the date when the
last of the union mechanics in the metal
â¢trades went out." About * 1200 men quit
their benches in this city.
v Plant Strongly Guarded.
None of the members of the Metal
Workers' Association will say how many
men have been secured"to take the places
made vacant by the strikers. It is
known, however, that a considerable
number of men have signed to go to work
for the Morans, and it is said that other
local concerns are following their ex
emple. While tho statement is made that
every effort will be put forth to prevent
trouble, yet the fact that the Moran Com
'pany is preparing, with the aid of armed
"men, to protect its employes and the
plant is held to be evidence that the of
ficers of the company* have reasons to
fear interference if not actual evidence
from the striking v/orkmen.
There are about twenty guards on duty
at the Moran plant at present, but the
services of a score or more men have
been secured and they are ready, it is
stated, to go to work at the first intima
tion of danger. E. A. Gardner, a well
known detective, is in charge of the
guards. His men are experienced, and he
says will be prepared for all emergencies.
The Morans to-day resumed work on
the Garonne, formerly an army transport,
which has been tied up for some weeks
because of the machinists' strike. Will
iam Moran said that the ship would be
readv for commission July 1. The gates
at the big plant are closed and closely
gOarded. It is as difficult to gain en
trance as it is to a fort in time of war.
The Morans' action leaves no room for
doubt that the big fight that will settle
the fate of the strike, which is being felt
all over the Pacific Coast, has at last
found its center. To-night everything is
quiet and no demand has been made 'on
the police or the Sheriff for action.

On June 8, in latitude 43 degrees 11 min
utes north, longitude 166 degrees 28 min
utes west, the transport Buford was
spoken. The Buford left Nagasaki on
May 26 and was expected here last Sun

of. coal was of the poorest and that he
was going to Honolulu for a new lot. The
buford was then 1382 miles from Honolulu
and 2000 from San Francisco. Captain
Merkens said he expected to make Hono
lulu by June 14 and would leave the next
&ay, arriving in San Francisco on June 24.

MOVEMENTS OF WARSHIPS.
The battleship Oregon will not be open
- At l:50Â«p. m. the men were sent away
to a fair start. Both crews were a little
unsteady at first, the Iowas rowing SS
strokes to the minute to the Wisconsins
4L For the first two miles there was not
half a boat's length between the contest
ants, the ' Wisconsins having the best of
it. The Iowas Increased- their stroke to
49 'and the Wisconsins responded with 44
to the minute. The latter boat then be
gan to draw away and when three miles
had been covered the Wisconsin was
eipht boat-lengths ahead. The Iowa was
then rowing 3S and the- Wisconsin 42
strokes to the minute.
Just about this time the stroke of the
Iowa caught a orab. and a few minutes
later No. 2 on the port bow accidentally
unshipped his oar. This gave the Wiscon
sin a lead of fifteen boat-lengths, which
the Iowa boys were never able to close.
As the winning boat passed the Wiscon
sin the boys on the battleship ran half a
dozen brooms to the top of the mast
and cheered themselves hoarse, while the
band on the Iowa played "See the Con
quering Heroes Come." The official time
for the race Â¦was 37 minutes 15 seconds â
very fast considering the circumstances.
About noon yesterday Lieutenant
O'Neill of the Wisconsin went aboard the
Iowa and in a few minutes all the pre
liminaries Â¦were arranged. At 1 p. m. the
crews got into the ships' launches, the
racing- barges were made fast behind and
a start was made for Hunters Point. The
course was from a point off the dryclock
to an imaginary line drawn from Folsom
street wharf to Goat Island, a distance
of four nautical miles, or four and five
eighths statute miles. The Wisconsin
boat drew the inshore position, but it
was of little assistance to her. A strong
breeze was blowing against the rowers,
which the first o'f the ebb tide was not
sufficient to neutralize.
The barges were manned as follows:
Wisconsin â F. Garvey, cockswain: C. Drake,
stroke: C. Nygard, C. Mad&on. C. Murphy. J.
R. Spratley. W. R. tThl. T. Nyland, A. Jorgen
een, C. Neubert, J. Eglit, H. T. Johnson and
C. Johnson.
Iowaâ J. Carroll, cockswain: E. Raws, stroke;
J. Tulloch, R. Bowers. W, Junior, H. Nilsson,
E. Flnnerty. A. Campbell. F. Pitsula, P. Geig
er. J. Capell. J. Beaudoin and E. H. Olsen.
t
match for $10 an oar was made. The race
was set for the 13th inst., but owing to
the Wisconsin having to go to Puget
Sound the event had to be postponed.
Then it was set for last Saturday, but
again the Wisconsin had to go to sea.
When she returned Sunday it was de
cided to hold the race yesterday at slack
water.
In the meantime the men had been
wagering freely on the event. Both sides
were confident, but in the case of the
Wisconsin the men had nearly a -whole
month's pay, behind them, while the. Iowa
boys had theirs nearly spent. Still they
managed to scrape together $1800, and the
Wisconsin men promptly covered it and
offered to bet $1500 more. The officers all
had bets among themselves, and it is
safe to say that fully $5000 changed hands
on the result. The outcome puts a new
champion ere* 1 in the field and the Iowa
boys will in future have to take a back
seat.

SETTLERS AT LOOKOUT
AiRE LIVING IN FEAR
Indian Scare Is Dying Out, but the
People Have Doubts About
Safety.
ALTURAS, June 17.â There is still much
anxiety felt here over the recent Indian
scare at Lookout, though no definite news
has been received from that place to-day.
The Grand Jury adjourned Saturday at
r.ion and took a recess until this morning
at 10 o'clock. All of the witnesses here
from the Lookout country departed im
mediately for their homes and returned
at 10 o'clock this morning.
A reDort reached here to-day, but has
not been corroborated, that the recent
uprising of Indians In the vicinity of
Lookout was caused by troubles among
themselves. The trouble grew out of a
quarrel which happened between two In
dians over a squaw. It is thought. that
the return of the witnesses to Lookout
may frighten the Indians to abandoning
tl-at part of the county, whatever their
purpose may have been.
POOLSELLING STOPPED.
Injunction Served on the Officers of
; >%,' Harlem Track.
CHICAGO. June 17.â No.tice of injunc
tion was served this afternoon upon the
officers of the Harlem racetrack as the
result of Judge Holden having granted a
writ against poolselling at the track. The
sport was not, however, interfered with
this afternoon. Whether, the effort to stop
racing will be successful the track own
ers do not venture to say. The movement
originated in the old . war between the
poolroom keepers,' John Condon, the pro
prietor of Harlem, and' his. partner, James
O'Leary, having antagonized other pool
room men, who have succeeded in enlist
ing the help of some prominent politi
cians. The latter have the co-operation
of the Citizens' League and all racing In
Chicago may be stopped. It is announced,
however, that there will be no interfer
ence with Saturday's Derby.

BIG SURPRISE TO MUSICIAN.
Calling on a friend the other evening, I :
found him, his wife and daughter deep In
a discussion as to the relative merits of
the works of Wagner, Beethoven, Men
delssohn and Chopin. They talked fluent
ly and apparently understanding^ of
Opus this and No. that, accent, phrasing,
tempo, legato, staccato and other tech
nical points. I was considerably sur
prised, as I did not know that any of
them were musicians, and I said to my
friend: "How is this? You are the very
man whom I have often heard say that
you would not buy a handsome piano, as
you could not, and your wife and daugh
ter would not. play." My friend laughed
and passed Into the parlor, where the
piano stood, and after a few moments the
room was filled with the wonderful meJody
of a berceuse by Chopin. After the ber
ceuse came one of Brahm's Hungarian
dances. No. 5, strong and swinging, and
then came a Liszt rhapsody. By this time
I knew what had happened â my friend
had bought a Pianola.
I went into the parlor and looked at the
Pianola, as I had heard a great deal
about, it, and in ten minutes I was as en
thusiastic as my friend. It played the
most difficult classical compositions and
gave my friend, who a year before knew
no more about music than a cow, as thor
ough an appreciation of music as I my
self possess, although I- had lived in a
musical atmosphere all my life.
The result of this was that I investi
gated the instrument manufactured by
the firm- who are responsible for the Pi
anola, and I found that the claims they
were making in their advertisements fell
far short of adequately describing the ex
cellent quality of their goods.
Taking my friend as a fair sample of
the American people, it would seem that
the Pianola will educate the musical
sense of our people, cultivate, sharpen
and elevate them until we. who popularly
have been believed to be deficient in mu
sical appreciation, will become the great
est musical nation in the world.â New

LONDON, June 17.â Charles Lillywhite,
who claims to be a naturalized American
and who says he has been In the United
States since 1SS5, but who was arrested in
New Zealand in November last and
brought to this country yesterday,
charged with being Arthur Blath, who is
accused of murder, robbery and arson
committed at Colchester, England, in 1893,

the disappointment of a number of curi
ous people who crowded the courtroom.

Arthur Blath in 1893 robbed and mur
dered Arthur Welch at Colchester. Eng

escaped' and no trace of him was found
until a man answering his description
Â¦was arrested at Wellington, N. Z., No
vember 16 last as the result of information
given to the police by a woman. The pris
oner was, identified as Blath at Welling
ton by two residents of London, but the
prisoner claimed to be Charles Lillywhite
and said he had an aunt named Caroline
Cook living in Chicago. He also said he
had homesteaded in the State of Wash
ington in 1892-93 and he had some docu
mentary evidence which supported his
claim.

fight to prove that Lillywhite is a victim
of mistaken identity and have forwarded

Elevation of the New Or
leans Archbishop .
Probable.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â The name of
Archbishop Chapelle of New Orleans has
been brought to the attention of the Vat
ican authorities and to the Pope in person
for elevation to the rank of Cardinal be
cause of his services as Papal Delegate
for the Philippines and West Indies.
Archbishop Chapelle is of French ori
gin and it is believed that his elevation
would be looked upon with favor by !he
French authorities.
In some ecclesiastical quarters It had
been felt that the church authorities over
the Philippines, Cuba and Porto ltico
should come under the American heii
aichy, rather than under a papal dele
gate, as the American church is better
able to co-operate with the. United States
Government in directing Insular affairs.
It Is understood this question also has
been brought to the attention of the Vat
ican during the visit of Cardinal Gibbons
and , Archbishop Chapelle. â¢ During one of
the audiences, when the elevation -- of
Archbishop Chapelle was urged on the
Pope, the latter expressed his high regard
for. the work of the Archbishop. "
It is the Intention to bring the matter
of the title of the : friars in, the Philip
pines to a determination by a trial In the
Supreme Court of the Philippines. Under
tne present condition there can be no ap
peal to the Supreme Court of the United
States,- but such an appeal could be. al
lowed If provided for In legislation at the
next Congress. . f , .
LONDON, June 17.â A dispatch to the

The main force of the British, under
Colonel- Swayne. departed for Eldab on

guard the zariba. Swayne's column ad
vanced against the Mullah's base. In the
meantime the Mullah with 3000 followers
attacked the zariba three times. He was
finally driven by Captain MacNeill,
with a loss of oOO men. The British in the
zariba had ten men killed and nine
wounded.
The Mullah Is now cut off from his base
and a decisive action is imminent. Â¦.

In the Senate yesterday Mr. Kanuha
spoke strongly in support of a majority
report of the Military Committee in favor
of wiping out the National Guard. The
report itself w,as a roast of the extrava
gance of expenditure upon the militia. An
item among many eliciting biting sarcasm
was the payment to a fashionable tailor
of $24 for a coat for Captain A. G. Hawes
Jr., private secretary to the Governor and
one of his military aids. Mr. Kanuha
had characterized as a sheer bluff a con
tention of Mr. Achi, who is a well known
Chino-Hawaiian lawyer, that the organic
act made It obligatory upon the Territory
to maintain an efficient military estab-
lishment. Proceeding with his remarks
he used the native word "hoopunipunl,"
meaning that some one had lied.
Cecil Brown sprang up in a passion and
said that if the rest of the Senate chose
to be insulted he was to be counted out.
After the uproar Mr. Kanuha quietly fin
ished his speech.
Cecil Brown made an Impassioned
speech against the majority report. When
interrupted by Dr. Russel with a point of
order he shouted that nothing less than
throwing him out Off the window could
prevent his freedom of utterance.
Afterward the minority report was
clared the Senate adjourned.
Dr. Russcl called Mr. Kalauokalani as
Vice President to the chair. The home
rule leader complied. Dr. Russel angrily
declared that his purpose in requesting
the chair to be filled v/as to bring charges
of contempt against the Senators who had
refused to come back. In violation of the
rule empowering less than a (juorum to
summon the attendance of absent mem
bers. After some desultory talk a sug
gestion that nothing could be done in the
absence of a quorum was adopted by the
Vice President declaring the Senate ad
journed. ...

a new trial for Roland B. Molineux, the
young New Yark clubman, athlete and
chemist, under sentence of death for poi

hear the famous case, and at the counsel's
table were ex-Senator David B. Hill, who
holds the brief of the people, %and John G.

room would hold crowded into the cor

fascinating crime linked with the mys
tery of the death of Henry C. Barnett.
The officers of the court barred the outer
doors and admitted the favored ones by
a rear entrance. Milburn for the appel
lant talked during- the entire session of
the court, gaining a hearing at 10:30
o'clock, when a civil case closed, and
speaking until 2 o'clock, when the court
arose for the day. He has another hour

should have four hours, and concludes in

Senator Hill sat throughout the entire
speech without an interruption that
called him to nis feet.
ililburns address of three and one-half
hours' duration was directed largely to
the alleged error of the lower court in
admitting evidence as to the death of
Heny C. Barnett, and he spared neither
Recorder Goff, the trial Judge, for his rul

ney's staff for its methods in securing the
admission of evidence. He spent nearly
two hours in a review of the known facts
of the two cases, and sought to show
what he described as the llimsv fabric
upon which the entire case rested.

The result of Saturday's meeting of the

emphasized the trouble of the situation

EARL RUSSELL
UNDER ARREST
Nobleman Who Married
in Reno Accused of
Bigamy.
Arraigned in a London Police
Court and Remanded
Â¦ on Bail.
LONDON, June 17.â Earl Russell was
arrested to-day on a : charge of having
contracted a bigamous marriage in the
United States. The Earl was met at the
railway station on his arrival f rora the
country by detectives with a warrant and
was taken to the Bow-street Police Court,
where he was formally charged. The no
bleman appeared to be quite unconcerned.
While Earl Russell awaited in the ante
room the summons to appear before 'the
magistrate the woman whom he married
in America joined him. When the case
was called a representative of the public
prosecutor said the prisoner was charged
with feloniously marrying Mrs. Mollle
Somervllle, daughter of the late George
C. Cooke of Combarnauld, Scotland.
The prosecution proceeded to outline the
Earl's marriage to Mabel Scott (his first
Countess), the separation, his subsequent
disappearance from England with a
neighbor, Mrs. Somerville, and the discov
ery that he tend Mrs. Scmerville were to
gether at Reno, New On April 14, 1900,
Earl Russell obtained n license to marry
Mollie Cooke, otherwise Mrs. Somerville,
In Nevada, and a Judge performed the
ceremony on April 15.
The prosecution announced that the Ne
vada District Judge, Mr. Koehler, and
witnesses of the marriage had arrived in
England to prove the ceremony.
Counsel for the defense intimated that
Earl Russell, having secured a divorce in
America, believed his subsequent mar
riage was legal. They pointed out that
the prosecution omitted mention of the
divorce proceedings instituted by hl3
lordship in America...
The Earl wns remanded Â«in Â£2000 ball.
In the event of a conviction the case will
be taken to the House of Lords, as Earl
Russell Is entitled to a trial by his peers.
DAMAGES DENIED
IN ITATA CASE
Vessel Was LawfullyJDe
tained, Says Claims
. Commission.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â The United
States and Chilean Claims Commission
completed its work to-day. The last case
to be decided was that involving the seiz
ure in 1S91 of the Chilean vessel Itata by
the authorities of the United States on
the ground that she was carrying a cargo
of contraband arms to Chile. The claim
was Â£44,051 with interest, and was made
by the South American Steamship . Com
pany, which had chartered the ship to
the Chilean Government. The decision
to-day dismisses the case. Minister Pioda
of Switzerland, president of the commis
sion, and Mr. Gage, the American Com
missioner, agreed in this, while Mr. Vi
cuna of Chile dissented. The commission
sums its finding as follows:
Firstâ That the i damages alleged by the
plaintiffs were -not occasioned by any unjus
tifiable action on the part of the " United
States; that the Itata was not pursued by the
naval authorities of the United States upon
the high seas into Chilean water, induced to
surrender by display of superior force and
brought back under duress. "
Second â That the Itata was voluntarlly
placed at the disposal of the United States by
the provisional government of Chile.
Thirdâ That there was probable cause for the
detention of the Itata at San Dleeo by the
authorities of the United States and there
fore no wrong was done.
Fourthâ That the claimant has brought suit
in the courts of Chile against the Govern
ment of Chile to recover damages upon the
identical claim that is here set up against
the United States; that the company has re
covered Judgment thereon and that these Judg
ments have been paid to the company by the
Government of Chile. The case must there
fore be dismissed.
Another important case decided to-day
was that of the Central and South Amer
ican Telegraph Company against Chile,
growing out of a tax of 2 cents a mes
sage levied during the uprising of 1891.
The commission awarded $4000 damages.
During the sessions of the commission
there have been seventeen cases against
Chile and two against the United States.
The total of American claims against
Chile was $3,400,000 and of this $28,062, or
.0S4 per cent, has been awarded by the
commission. The two Chilean claims
aeainst this Government were the -Itata
case, disposed of to-day, and that of
Richard Trumbuli; who was awarded
$3000 for services to the United States Le
gation in Chile in an extradition case
some years apro.

Efi ' EhThe Kansas City woman. who killed her husband
and added horror to the act by kicking the dead body
in the face is discrediting the current theories of mur
der as a fine art by showing signs of emotion at the
trial.
A Georgia negro recently applied to an attorney
to collect $10 due him by another darky, and when
asked why the debtor didn't pay, he explained: "He
says he has been owing me that money so long that
the interest has done eat up the principal, and now.
he don't' owe me anything." As a new way of pay
ing old debts that takes the cake.
American sovereignty has brought trouble as well as
a pension to the Sultan of Jolo. He has long collected
a tax from the pearl fishers in the waters around his
islands, but now foreign corporations have bought up
the fisheries and are working them with improved ap
pliances, and to the Sultan's disgust they refuse to
pay the tax. This is the first time the Sultan ever ran
up against a tax shirker, and he appears to be losing
sleep over it
Justice Harlan is a brave and learned judicial of
ficer, and has that independent spirit which is needed
on the bench, where judicial courage is of the highest
importance. It is probable that he would be the last
man to consent to invade and destroy the history and
traditions of that bench.
Among the many feather-headed and harmful
propositions for which Mr. Bryan is responsible this
is probably the worst and is conceived in the most
reckless spirit.
It is among the laws unwritten in American public
life that it is not well to tempt Judges with that great
prize as a reward for their judicial action. No one
has ever accused or suspected McLean, Chase or Field
of sophisticating their judicial action from any such
motive, but it is easy to see that when the road from
the bench to the Presidency is once opened the effect
Â¦will be that some on the bench will keep half an eye
on the law and an eye and a half on popular applause,
' to the degradation of the court.
He favors Harlan because he thinks his decisions
are popular. The people have never taken kindly to
the proposition to look on the Supreme bench for
Presidential timber. Justice McLean of Ohio was
talked of as the Republican candidate in i860, but it
was more to conciliate the old Whig element than
for any other purpose, and the proposition made no
headway against Lincoln. After the close of the
Civil War Chief Justice Chase was taken up by cer
tain elements in the Democratic party, and himself
promoted his candidacj- in 1868, but the movement did
not become popular. David Davis was looked upon
for a time as Presidential timber, but.never got near
being nominated In 18S0 and 1884 the South, in
gratitude for his decisions on the reconstruction
measures, favored the nomination of Justice Field,
and he came nearer the nomination than any other
member of that court. It is believed that if Califor
nia had given him a united support he would have
succeeded. It is not probable that the elements which
â¢were in his favor will ever again be so combined as
to come as near overcoming the popular indisposition.
HARLAN FOR PRESIDENT.
MR, BRYAN lias recommended the nomination
of Justice Harlan as the Democratic candi
date for President The trifling fact that the
Justice is a Republican does not seem to affect Mr.
Bryan's choice. That is natural, however, for the
party nominated him, though he was a Populist and
not a Democrat.
The Populists of Kansas and Nebraska-appear tobe
quitewilling to accept Bryan as a standing candidate
and they are not unwilling^ to >'fus<with the Democrats,
but what grinds them is the difficulty of finding some-
The, language of the letter is interesting. After
acknowledging a note from the Secretary informing
him that the members of the. Cuban commission
feared that the provisions relative to intervention
made in the third clause of the amendment may .'have
the effect of preventing the independence of Cuba, and
in reality establish a protectorate or suzerainty by the
United States, Senator Platt goes on to say:' "In re
ply. I beg to state that the amendment was. carefully
prepared with the object of avoiding any possible idea
that, by the acceptance thereof/- the* constitutional
At the time of the conference of the Cuban envoys
with the War Department on the subject of the
amendment Senor Capote is said to have obtained
from Secretary Root, under promise to treat it as con
fidential, a letter written to the Secretary by Senator
Platt stating the meaning and intent of his amend
ment. .Instead of holding the letter in confidence the*
Cuban gave it out for publication' on his arrival at
Havana, and it is said that the adoption.of the amend
ment by the constitutional convention was due to the
fact that a majority of the members construed -it as
a declaration of the intentions of the United States
Government. :
WHILE the recent acceptance of the
Platt amendment by. the Cuban constitu
tional convention would seem on its face to
put an end to any further controversy on the subject,
it appears from later reports that the means by which
the adoption was brought about may give rise to a
good deal of friction between ourselves and the Cu
bans before their government is permanently estab
lished and our army withdrawn. '. ,

Some of the figures of imports of food supplies are
interesting. â¢ The Westminister Gazette in reviewing
the report says: â " ; V
The smaller acreage devoted to ] farming and the
decline in the yield per acre did not in any way affect
the food supply of the ; people. The kindgdom is
now so well furnished with all kinds- of food stuffs
from foreign countries that the home production cuts
but little figure in i he market. It appears in fact
from the report that the year was a good one for
consumers arid that the people were sufficiently pros
perous to live better than ever before in recent times.
FROM a 'summary, published in ,the /London
papers of the recently issued annual .report of
the British Board of Agriculture, it appears the
past year was an exceptionally bad one for the farm
ers of 'the kingdom. It is stated that almost every
crop yielded less per acre than in the previous year.
The cultivation of wheat continues to. decline, the
area devoted' to that crop in 1900 being 156,000 acres
less_ than in 1899. The acreage of other cereals re
mained about the same as in the previous year, with
the exception that there was a sufficient increase in
the area' devoted to oats to account for; more than
half the land withdrawn from wheat.

On June 30 there were under construc

Of course if such a scheme be designed it will not
be undertaken in the. crude way that. was adopted in
the division of Poland. Diplomacy has become more
subtle than it was. The movements on Korea and
Manchuria would be made very slowly.. By a gradual
process "Russia would have paramount influence in
the one and Japan in the other, and at last it would
come quite as a matter of course that the annexations
should take place in much the same way as the re
cent annexation of Finland as an integral part of the
Â¦Russian empire. ,
Should such an arrangement be made there would
be an interesting problem before the concert of Eu
rope. Russia has been held back from despoiling the
Turk, but could she be held back from despoiling the
Chinaman, if Japan were united- with her?
There is nothing of improbability in the story. The
ease with which rival nations can compound their
quarrels as soon as they perceive an opportunity to
despoil another nation by acting in concert is well
known. Diplomacy has understood that method of
establishing peace ever since the. days when Russia,
Austria and Prussia settled all their old feuds by the
easy plan of uniting to destroy and dismember Poland.
Consequently, since the eastward movement of Rus
sia is a menace to Japan, and since the antagonism
of Japan would be dangerous to Russia's- designs on
China, it is but natural it should have occurred to
some astute statesman and peacemaker that the best
thing to be done for the sake of avoiding war is to
divide Manchuria and Korea between them. . .
REPORTS of the mutual jealousy between Rus
sia and Japan and rumors of probable war in
the near future have been "common ever since
Japan defeated China and Russia took possession. of
Port Arthur. European diplomacy. has now another
tale to tell. It is said there are' reasons for believing
that the Mikado, and the Czar have found a basis of
conciliation and harmony, and that their Govern
ments are negotiating an agreement by which Japan
is to permit Russia to have a free hand in Manchuria
and Russia is to consent to let Japan direct and con
trol the affairs of Korea. ; .

CALIFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 17.â The
To sum up . this necessarily most short
and incomplete account of British colonial
policy, we find that the two chief points
are the willingness to adapt the govern
ment to suit special cases and the en
couragement of trade by hqlding open the
customs door and granting equal trading
rights for all merchants. In the past the
former was the more important point, but
now, alas, that each administrator is tied
to the Colonial Office by the cable, much
of its value has departed. It is this mel
ancholy red tape cable which causes one
to welcome the assistance of chartered:
companies and private enterprise.
So long as Great Britain holds to free
trade and adaptation she will be success
ful and worthy of being followed.
Two Chief Elements of Success.
In the Malay archipelago Great Britain
has had to deal with many of the ele
ments of trouble with which the United
States is now face to face in the Philip
pines. .These she has successfully over
come and now has the satisfaction of
owning colonies at peace and growing: in
prosperity In the extreme.
The natives In the British colonies are
insured just laws and have the neces
saries of life provided for them at a rea
sonable rate. They are not allowed to
fight whenever the fit takes them, buc
must live orderly, well-behaved lives. In
several of the colonies Great Britain has
raised native regiments, notably for work
in the malarial African tropics. These
troops, led by white men, work splen
didly, and- afford a safety valve to the.
military ardor of races who for centuries
have regarded fighting as the amusement
most to be desired. If Great Britain were
a military power she could easily raise a
native army, large enough to enable her
to enforce her wishes on land as well as
on sea. However, she prefers to use the
natives as coolies or as tillers of the soil.
Who shall say her course is not a wise
one?
While Great Britain gives great lati
tude to the natives in her possessions, as
far 'as local affairs are concerned, she is
very particular that they shall acquire
no real ruling power, or at least no over
whelming voice in the ruling power. "When
the " native population outnumbers the
white in such great proportion as is usual
in Britsh coloniesâ non-self-governingâ it
would be suicidal to follow any other
course until at least the natives have
reached a high level of education and civ
ilization. Until such a time it Is far more
judicious and kinder to protect them from
the results which would inevitably befall
if they were permitted to mislegislate be
fore they have learned even their A B C'a.
After a cautious training In local and mu
nicipal government they may bo allowed
in time to have a voice In the actual gov
ernment. In countries where there are
several differing native races it is mani
festly impossible to allow members of ono
race to govern othersâ such a course
would directly lead to risings and disturb
ance of the peace.
Natives and the'Buling Power.
Though it may be said that companies
are useful in opening up countries, there
is no doubt that they must ever be super
seded in those countries after a time by
British protectorates. Great Britain owes
much to the fact that the open door and
equal privileges for all merchants in her
territories, wnether of. her nation or not,
encourage trade to an enormous extent.
The trade may not be British trade, fre
quently now it is American or German
trade, but the colony prospers and devel
ops steadily. In these days, as in tha
past, there can never be successful phi
lanthropic colonization, even if any nation
were to attempt it. Colonization must
proceed by trade, just as steam is neces
sary for a locomotive. The end attained
may be very high and people may then
look down with infinite scorn upon trade;
nevertheless, it is always trade which has
made colonization successful. France has
tried to colonize by planting a flag and
having troops occupy more or less miser
able Imitations of Paris, and she haa suc
ceeded in having an annual drain upon
her rational income of enormous propor
tions.
The Policy of the Open Door.
SUCCEEDS AS A COLONIZER.
into colonies, adding, however, immediate
state protectionâ a doubtful advantage,
entailing, as It does, a certain amount of
state supervision.
. It must be very evident even to the
most unobservant citizen that there Is a
far greater - probability of rapid develop
ment for a new country under such, a
company than can be the case under di
rect British control. There are dividends
to be earned and shareholders' meetings
to be faced. It is necessary, that the
company shall be acquainted, and inti
mately acquainted, with their trading
ground and its inhabitants. Under state
control there is apparently no such ne
cessity for accurate knowledge. Of
course, there is always the possibility
that the company will abuse its powers
and neglect its obligations in the anxiety
to earn an extra per cent In dividends.
Such action, however, always brings its
inevitable punishment In the shape of re
duced privileges, so It is never likely to
become popular among companies.
COPTRH
XTO-WHY GREAT BRITAIN
There can be laid down no hard and fast
rules or general policy to. describe the
colonizing of Great Britain. With each
new colony new methods are employed,
yet they all -have as a foundation the
main, principle of adaptationâ adaptation
of the government bo as to incorporate
air that is good and possible in the native
customs, and upon this stem to engraft
the buds of British progress and enlight
enment. To this policy England ." owes
much of her success in founding and
maintaining colonies. By colonies I mean
integral parts of the empireâ not costly
advertisements of a colonial policy or
battlefields for the training of soldiers
and the massing of fortunes by con
tractors.
The Englishman who settles In new
territory regards it ' as so much land to
be developed and made" to bring forth the
maximum amount of valuable produce.
He retains many of his customs and
habits, but once settled he has every in
tention of remaining to enjoy the fruits
of. his labors/" England is always "home"
to him, even if he never visits it again,
in the same way as it Is always "home"
to colonial-born Englishmen and Eng
lishwomen. This feeling toward England
is one of the most pleasing features of
the silken bonds which hold the empire
so firmly together. In the Englishman
there is innate the kno\Â»ledge that he is
par excellence tfe pioneer and explorer
of the world, and that knowledge lifts
him up well above the natives whom he
has to rule. . It gives to the English that
sublime confidence In their powers Â¦which
goes far to gain the confidence of the na
tive races. If you would gain the belief
of others you must first have belief in
yourself.
French, and German Colonizing.
-The Frenchman in his colonies seeks
ever to reproduce there the Paris of his
dreams; and for him there ever shines the
possibility of being able to return to that
city with a sufficient fortune to obviate
any departure from it in the future. Such
aspirations .may tend to the rapid acqui
sition of wealth, but they certainly, do
not help the development of the colony.
The Germans, on the other hand, seek
ever to introduce at once a system of
rigid military government, with a mili
tary governor and a strong garrison.
They turn the new colony as far as pos
sible into a recruiting ground. This meth
od is most successful in the thoroughness
with which it discourages German and
other merchants from establishing them
selves in German colonies.
British. Methods and Trade.
The British seek ever to encourage
trade in their new possessions and have
no desire to spend unnecessary money
upon warlike expeditions if they can ob
tain peace by reasonable incorporation of
native customs. The colonies of the
British empire are essentially business
concerns with very few exceptions. Pri
marily attracted by the opportunities of
successful trade, the British have been
forced, as that trade developed, to extend
their trading grounds. So long as this
was possible by peaceful methods,- such
methods were employed. I cannot say
that these- methods always redounded to
the credit of the traders, but it is certain
that, whatever . the acts of Individuals,
the central government was so anxious
for peace that it did not criticize too
closely the methods by which it waa
maintained. As the spheres of trade
grew \ larger j and larger, the aboriginal
tribes felt the inconvenience and Injustice
of losing their lands, even at a price, and
attacked the traders. Then followed ex
peditions, mobile, well organized and well
armed, resulting in the death of many
natives and the subjugation of the rest.
The terms enforced, however, were sel
dom hard and frequently the natives who
had fought against the white men were
almost at once' organized as native police
or native regiments to guard the trading
interests.
Examples of Trade Development.
In several instances the fact that the
British policy in colonizing is to develop
trade has received striking proof. Â»I re
fer to "those cases in which charters have
been granted to companies enabling them
to develop territories until such a time
as they were fit to be taken under Brit
ish protection. Such companies from the
time of the Great India Company have
generally succeeded in a marvelous man
ner and have gained for the British many
prosperous colonies and territories. In
recent years there have been the Royal
Niger Company, the North Borneo Com
pany and the British South African Com
pany. The first two have now given place
to British protectorates and eventually
the British South Africa Company, that
enormous creation of Mr. Rhodes, will
follow their example. That this system
of private colonization is good is proved
by results. The German Government
also, in several cases, has introduced it

, : : Of course the Cubans will eventually learn that the
administration can do no more ,than to carry out
the mandate of Congress, but before that is fully
learned there may be a good many complications. In
the meantime it is probable the Secretary of War has
learned that it is not safe to trust Cuban statesmen
with confidential communications or anything else
that is loaded. Â¦ ' ' Â¦ '
.- By reason: of the letter it seems the Cubans', or
some of them at least, came to the conclusion that the
United States army would be withdrawn as soon as
the constitution was adopted. The Washington corre
spondent of the Philadelphia Public Ledger says: "Tha
understanding here is that- Senor Capote,, the presi
dent of the convention, and one of the visiting Com
missioners, himself gave out the letter for publica
tion in Havana, and it is 'further charged that he did
so with the express intention to misrepresent the po
sition of this Government, and embarrass the admin
istration, if possible." ' â¢
convention . would thereby establish : a protectorate or
suzerainty, 'or in any manner whatsoever compromise
the independence or sovereignty v - of - Cuba; ; and,
speaking* for myself, it seems impossible that such an
interpretation can be : given to : the clause. ; I \ believe
that the amendment. should be considered as a^whole,
and it ought to^be clear on reading it that its_ well de
fined purpose is to secure and safeguard Cuban inde
pendence_and set forth at \ once a clear idea of -the
friendly jj disposition "of : the -United States toward the
Cuban, people, and the ; ( . express â¢ intention on their
part to "aid them if necessary; in the'maintenance of
said independence. These are my. ideas, and, although
as you say I cannot speak for the entire Congress,, my
belief is, that; such a purpose was well understood by
lhat'bodyi" ' :' . " .
The Call, in the interest of the whole livestock in
dustry, raised the voice of warning long ago, and
foretold this most distressing situation, which threat
ens injury" to the stockmen, the transportation com
panies, the domestic consumer and the meat export
trade alike. The remedy is easy. Lease the ranges
and devote the proceeds to irrigation. . .
The Denver" Stockman admits that when the fences
are removed the situation will be unbearable, as it will
take but a short time to permanently destroy the
feed, leaving nothing for sheep or cattle. Sheep men
anticipate a glut in the market because sheep that
cannot be fed must be sold, and. cattle men foresee a
shortage in feed before the end of summer and the
expulsion of their herds from the range by sheep.
On Otter Creek, Wyoming, 2000 sheep have been
killed by driving them over a cliff, and the sheep men
at Sheridan are arming for war.
A citizen of Wyoming admits that the cattle men
have no defense left but their ; Winchesters. He
says: "Personally I am not in favor of that kind of
a fight, but there are plenty of men on the range
who are, and promise to kill every sheep man in the
State as soon as the word is given. The conservative
sheep men and cattle men are doing all they can to
prevent an open conflict," but the situation is growing
worse every day. It is the small cattle-owners and
farmers who are suffering the worst. The sheep mean
ruin for them, and they feel they have the moral
right to protect their range by force. The sheep men
arc fully as desperate. They are all struggling for
enough grass to keep their sheep alive, and they feel
that the public range is as much theirs as the cattle
men's. They are organizing, and while, they are on
the defensive now it will take but little to put them
on the other side of the game. We may stave off
trouble till the fences are all torn down, but after that,
look out for bloodshed."
Near Cheyenne, a cattle man rented a section of land'
and put 120 head of cattle on it. His stock was
driven off in the night by sheep men and so scattered
that he did not Tecover them.
In Gunnison County, Colorado, the sheep got
across the line and the Colorado fighters have killed
several thousand of them, first making prisoners of
the herders.
The railroads have promised not to bring any more
sheep into Colorado from the ranges that have been
fed out by them .in Southern Utah. But tens , of
thousands of sheep have been driven to the Colorado
line, which is patroled by an armed guard to keep
them out.
At Eaton and Lone Tree, Colo., the sheep men
are in a Winchester war with invading sheep men
from Wyoming.
At Pine Bluffs and Grover, in that State, the small
cattle-growers and farmers, finding themselves, likely
to be starved out by sheep, have assaulted three sheep
camps, burned the wagons and driven the sheep off
the range. Â»
In Star Valley, Wyoming, the cattle men are also
land-owners, as cattle men usually are, and the sheep
have fed the range bare to their fences. They have or
ganized in self-defense and sent a warning notice to
the sheep men, with the intention of offering armed
resistance. Â¦ > , ~
The- cattle men in the Pecos Valley, New Mexico,
have been driven but by invading sheep and have re
treated, fighting. One, man has been killed in the
war.
A dispatch from Pierre, S. D., says that sheep are
pouring into, the Black Hills by 'ten's of thousands,
and the best cattle ranges are being occupied by them.
In consequence cattle men see their doom ; and are
selling their herds at a sacrifice or moving them on,
knowing that the range destroying sheep will over
take them wherever they go.
In this manner sheep first drove cattle from the
Oregon range, and now Mr. Mills, livestock agent of
the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, says
that 2,000,000 sheep. will starve in Oregon this year
unless they are taken- elsewhere to feed. It is pro
posed to send them to the public ranges of Nebraska
and Kansas, where they will repeat the destruction
that has made impossible their maintenance in
Oregon.* -
Heretofore by drift fences and -various devices for
inclosing the arid. ranges on: the public domain the
stockmen have managed to .eontrorand preserve some
feed. But now.it is decided that these fences and in
closures are contrary to law, and the Government is
tearing - them, down and ; those . who used them are,
being criminally indicted. ; The cattle interest is the
principal sufferer, because the moment sheep are
driven on the range cattle leave it, as they will not
feed where sheep run. An actually free public range
means a range monopolized by sheep, and they soon
turn it into a'desert. V
THE Denver Stockman reports cattle receipts at
that point declined to only one-fourth the usual
number, arid attributes the shortage to the lack
of feed caused by destruction of the forage in the wild
scramble for the free range.

City Attorney Lane was asked for an,
opinion whether the legislative act gov
erning the sale of street . railroad and
other franchises conflicted with the pro
visions of the charter, and if so which
controlled in this city.
The petition of M. Adrian King for a
franchise for a telephone system was re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee.
The act of the Legislature, approved April 11,
1S78, gave the Park Commissioners "all the
powers over Point Lobou avenue," as if the
same had "been originally a part of Golden
Gate Park." Section 4 of the act approved
April 4 says "that the board shall have full
and exclusive power to govern, manage and
direct the said j>arks and avenues."
Queryâ Are the parts of the franchises grant
ed November 6. 1878. running along Point Lobos
avenue, from Central to First avenue, and the
franchise of 1890, running along Point Lobos
avenue, from First to Fifth avenue, valid? >
Queryâ Is the franchise of November 6, 1878.
covering exactly the same ground aa the fran
chise of April 13, 1S77, with the additions of the
two blocks from Geary to Stockton street, a
valid one?
The oroiglnal franchise granted the Geary
street Itailroad for twenty-five years from
April 13. 1S77, commenced at Stockton street
and ran along Geary street and Point Lobos
avenue to First avenue, and thence to the park.
The following year another franchise for twen
ty-five years was granted, to expire November
6, 1903, commencing at Kearny street and run
ning along Geary street to Stockton and along
and covering the same streets as .the franchise
of the year previous. The extension of Â¦ the
above was granted from September 17, 1899, to
run across Kearny street to Market. In 1890
a franchise was granted to expire November 6,
1903, along Point Lobos avenue, from First ave
nue to Fifth, and thence to the park.
The petition of the Richmond District
Improvement Association that S4000 be ex
pended to prepare plans for the acquisi
tion of the Geavy-street Railroad by the
city was referred to the Public Utilities
Committee, with a request that the City
Attorney inquire into the validity of the
franchises on Point Lobos avenue. After
asking- that the first special election for
the acquisition of the road be held in Sep
tember the attention of the board is called
to the following facts:
The ordinance repealing orders requir
ing street railway companies to provide
guarda for cars and dummies for tne pur
pose of preventing accidents and loss of
life and prescribing the character of life
guards or. fenders to be attached to street
railroad cars was finally passed. This al
lows the State law to govern and will
compel the companies to install adequate
safeguards.
Supervisor McCarthy, a member of the
committee, stated that most of the rail
way companies are not operating under
their original franchises, wmch stipulated
the amount of the license tax. McCarthy
said that the report of the committee
would be in favor of an increase.
City Attorney Lane's o'plnion holds that
where no license tax has been fixed in a
franchise granted to a street railway cor
poration It is within the power of the city
to" compel payment of such reasonable
license tax as the legislature of the mu
nicipality may prescribe. Where, how
ever, the franchise fixes the amount of
the license tax which* may be charged and
expressly denies to the municipality
power to increase such amount the board
then has not the power to increase the
license.
The ordinance Increasing the license on
street cars from $15 to $50 per annum was
reref erred to .the Committee on' License
and Orders by the Board of Supervisors
yesterday, and in accordance with an
opinion filed ' by the City Attorney it Is
probable that the bill will be recommend
ed for passage.

That It Will Accept Asssssor's
Ultimatum.
The Alaska Packers' Association has
signified its intention to no longer resist
the payment of the franchise tax. Word
was conveyed to the Assessor yesterday
That all further legal proceedings would
be discontinued and the amount of the
assessment. $3250. will be paid into the
treasury within a day or two.
At the time Assessor Dodge levied the
tax on the franchises of it large number
at corporation* 5 , considerable opposition
was manifested, many of tne corporations
threatening to withdraw their principal
offices from the Stale. Among these was
the Alaska Packers' Association. A
northern port was to be selected as its
principal place of business and there the
outfitting of ships, gathering of crews
and purchasing cf 6upplies would be un
dertaken. After a. serious consideration
of the difficulties to be encountered and
the undisputed 1 advantages of San Fran
cisco as an outfitting point. It was de
cided to remain here.
"This action on thj part of the Alaska
Packers' Association, said Assessor
Dodge, "presages a change of base on the
part of other corporations which have
been resisting the payment of taxes as
sessed on their franchises. I would esti
mate from the Information that I have
received that taxes on assessed franchise
valuations of $3/>00.000 will be paid Into
the treasury. This â¢will materially in
crease the surplus in the treasury."

Olaf Anderson Grieves Life Away on
Account of the Loss of
His Wife.
Olaf Anderson, a' Norwegian, is slowly
grieving his life away in the house of a
friend, at 721 Minna street on account of
the death of his wife, and three little chil
dren, dependent on his earnings, are des
titute. 'The sad case has been reported to
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children and Secretary White has the
matter under investigation.
Anderson came to this country from
Norway several years ago, brinering his
wife with him. He was sober and indus
trious and for some time prospered. His
wife finally became ill and the earnings of
long years of labor were spent in a vain
endeavor to restore her to health. Two
years ago she died, leaving her husband
with four children.
He was heartbroken and lost all inter
est in life. Except when urged to action
by his friends, he would sit all day brood-
Ing over his misfortune. He worked only
at intervals and then mechanically, with
no hope or spirit. Finally he became too
weak to work more and he has since been
cared for by the charity of his fellow
countrymen.
Anderson and his children were taken in
by John Hansen, but the latter is poor
and feels that he can no longer bear the
expense of two families. -Letters of
guardianship have been applied for and
the children will probably be placed in
some charitable institution.
JUBY SECTTB-ED FOB
THE McGLADE TRIAL
The Taking of Testimony Will Begin
This Morning' Before Judge
Burnett.
The fourth trial of Peter TV. McGlade
on the charge of forgery was commenced
yesterday morning before Judge A. G.
Burnett of Santa Rosa in Judge Cook's
court. Attorney Lennon represented the
defendant and District Attorney Byington
and Assistant District Attorney Deuprey
represented the people.
There was very little time wasted In se
curing the Jury. . Before the adjournment
at noon nine had been secured and the
other three were chosen during the after
noon. The Jurors are: W. Lowenbesg;
broker; R. E. Darbee, wholesale oyster
merchant; Thatcher Emery, retired cap
italist; L. Van Laak, broom manufactur
er; H. C. McClure, agent: George Kilpat
rick, retired capitalist; Jacob Schwerdt,
furniture dealer; J. P. Eklund. stationer:
Thomas Johnstone, secretary; Arthur
Deittle. merchant; James Gorie, and John
Williams. - â¢ -
After the Jury was secured it was de
cided to continue the case till this morn
ing, when testimony will be heard.
Steals Clothes From Steamers.
Manuel Gestres was booked at the City
Prison by Detective Egan yesterday on
the charge of burglary. Saturday, it Is
alleged, he entered a room on the steamer
Sonoma and stole a suit of clothes, leav
ing his old suit in exchange.
With this board of directors and all
differences settled among the old stock
holders, all of the lawsuits settled and
dismissed, and Mr. Charles Newman, who
was the active factor in pushing forward
the work for the old company, again
swinging Into line to promote the success
of the new corporation, there Is little
doubt that the ship will take flight within
the next ninety days, and all of its stock
holders will reap the reward which they
are Justly entitled to for their persistent
efforts in pioneering and making a suc
cess cf this most impartant branch of
scientific navigation.
Now, however, the whole matter has
been amicably arranged by the sale of the
plant tc a new corporation. . organized for
that purpose, called the "California Aerial
Navigation Company," and the directors
of this company are in themselves a suf
ficient guarantee that the business will
be carried forward in such a manner as
will satisfy all parties concerned.
Mr. I. J. Truman of the Columbian
Banking Company Is president. Mr. Frank
W. Page of the Vulcan Smelting and Re
fining Company is secretary and the other
mrrnbers of the board comprise the fol
lowing gentlemen: Mr. George Graham,
Dr. Born, Mr. E. ll Sneli. Mr. Leo New
man. Mr. Oscar Menchen, Mr. William
LJruckman and Mr. Charles Stanley.
There have been good and sufficient
reasons, however, why this promise was
not kept. There is nothing at fault with
the mechanism or construction of the ship
itself, but financial difficulties Intervened
to delay its progress; the stockholders be
came diFFatisfUid with certain members of
the uoard of directors, and this difficulty
found its way into the courts. When this
happens all efforts to carry on an enter
prise must prove useless, and only time
wi!l serve to overcome the law'6 delays.
The public has been justly disappointed
on account of the. -ar.kept promises of the
Stanley Aerial Navigation Company to
construct its ship and rc&eem its pledges
to navigate the air, which it promised it
v.ould do in ths month of Hay.
All impediments in the way of its suc
cessful navigation are overcome.
The Stanley Airship Is Now Going
to Sail.
The board passed to print an ordinance
to pay three judgments lor $29,253 53, $13,
256 04 and $1609 10, respectively, to J. W.
Mackay and R. V. Dey on condition that
they pay certain taxes..- A judgment for
$11,142 71, secured fcy the First National
Bank for taxes paid under protest, was
also ordered paid.
The ordinance providing that certain
appropriations contained in the budget
for 1901-2 be exempted from the one
twelfth act in the charter was finally
passed, notwithstanding Brandenstem's
contention that such a course would be a
palpable violation of the charter.
The attorneys for A. M. Rosenbaum,
Joseph Brandenstein aud others petitioned
for the return of $323 44 paid under pro
test as taxes tor the interest and sinking
funds of the park, sewer, hospital and
school bonds, since declared invalid. The
petitioners say that "all moneys collected
under the invalid bond issue should, both
in law and equity, be refunded to the
parties paying the same who have taken
the prcper legal steps to protect them
selves."
Ask Return of Bond Taxes.
The Auditor and Treasurer were direct
ed to carry forward an unexpended bal
ance of $4657 in the telephone fund as
such, so that it will not foe diverted to the
surplus fund.
Sanderson desired to know if a demand
for $20 for sending Frederick Peterson,
an invalid, back to Utah should not be
paid out of the Mayor's contingent fund,
and his Honor replied tersely that the
fund was not subject to inquiry.
The demands of the Golden Gate Elec
trical Company for work done in court
rooms in the Hall of Justice were re
ferred to the Building Committee. The
demands are in the form of court orders
and the Finance Committee rejected
them.

mendation of the Board of Works, order

The bill authorizing the Health Board
to expend an additional $1500 to cleanse
Chinatown was passed to print. Hotaling
objected, as he put it, "to cleanse one
man's house and not another's," but the
Mayor explained that the State was
spending $4 to fl expended by the city to
make Chinatown sanitary.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print an ordinance granting an
extension of ninety days from June 27,
1901, to the Bay and Coast Railway Com
pany in which to expend the sum of $25,
000 in construction work on its proposed
line from this city to Santa Cruz. The
extension was granted because the Board
of Works notified the Supervisors that
the official grades on the proposed route
have not been fixed and the tracks will
cut into the naln outlet of the North
Point sewer. The board will establish
the grades in the meantime. Reed op
posed the extension because the road has
not fifty miles of track, as required by
the charter, and McCarthy also objected
because the company had not agreed to
substitute electricity for steam In the city
limits when deemed necessary by the
board.

tion to the work performed was Indefi
nitely postponed on recommendation of
the Finance Committee by the Board of
Supervisors yesterday.
Reed opposed the indefinite postpone
ment, claiming that It was Incumbent
on the Board of Works to tile a written
explanation of repeated charges deroga
tory to its administration. Brandenstein
eaid the adoption of the resolution would
be practically a recognition of the at
tacks, and the board was thus relieved of
the necessity of makinsr a defense.
.tiraridenstein objected to the passage
of the bill granting the Merchants' Cold
Storage Company a special permit to
erect a nine-story building on Lombard
street on the ground that it was in con
llict with the proposed building ordi
nance. He expressed himself opposed to
granting special permits as being vicious
legislation, and then voted in lavor of
me privilege, which was granted. Wilson
also unsuccesstully objected to a permit
lor the erection ot a buy window project
ing over the line of \v r ilham street by
J ur.n W iren. The Chutes Company was
granted a. permit to alter a building so
mat it may be used for a theater, after
israndenstein had inveighed against the
board's practice of violating Its own ordi

The ordinance removing the limitation

withstanding the recommendation of the
Printing Committee that the bid be re

' J'EW YORK. June 17.â The stock market
made a vigorous attempt to-day to withstand
the chilling effect of heavy exports of gold
and the flurry in the money rate to 5 per cent,
but the general show of strength at the open
ing: was forced to succumb to this develop
ment in spite of the persistence of some no
ts.bly strong spots. The closing showed ad
vances very generally wiped out except in
tlv? few stocks which moved against the cur
rfTit. St. Paul continued to be most con
spicuous and the strength in that stock was
supplemented by advances in various other
railroad stocks from individual causes and by
3. buoyant tone for the independent steel com
panies and a few industrials. Missouri Pa
cific was slightly affected by the dividend.
The acticn of the market on Saturday after
the appearance cf the bank statement had been
sufficient notice that the financial powers were
prepared to ignore the showing of that state
ment and to continue their etlorts for an ad
vance. The opening was strong in conse
quence with Z1M shares of St. Paul taken at a
fpread cf 2% points, the quotation on run
mrs sales varying from 181% to ISt, com
j;are<3 with ISO on Saturday. The stock
touched ISC% l2tcr in the day on enormous
dealings. The belief is well denned that an
oiler is to be made of 4 per cents at the
raito cf 200 at par of bonds for 100 at par of
rhc ctorks. as - vras done for the Burlington.
AÂ« certificates ~Xor the Burlington stocks are
ruling at ltS'/i, the price seemed to be the
objective rotat ior St. Paul. The heavy re
alizir.g which -met the stock's advance at
each stage and its lala reaction, however,
a conjecture that the final settle
ment in the matter remains to be made. Tbe,
independent 6tccl companies were affected by
rumors cf pending absorption Jnto the United
State Steel Corporation. Tennessee Coal rose
an 7Vi. Colorado Fuel, u%; Republic
Steel; â¢ 8>,Â« : the preferred 3 and Hocking Coal.
t'4. Tfae advance of 4;i in Illinois Central had
no other explanation than the high rate of
ike dividend return at its price.
Amalgamated Copper -was firm all day. but
it was not until the' final dealings that it
*vas rushed precipitately up to 130 with in
dications of distress on the part of the
s.taorts. The activity of the trading decreased
conspicuously after the gold shipments Were
announced to an aggregate of $4,000,000. The
belief is general that further shipments will
be made later in the week. Berlin ie clearly
enough the point of trouble, for' which re
lief is being provided. The sterling exchange
rate there fell to-day to 20 marks 43V4 Pigs,
compared with 20 marks 44U pfprs last Mon
day and 20 marks 46 pfjss two weeks Â»ci.
The semi-annual requirements at Berlin arÂ»>
always heavy and at this time a condition: of
distrust esists rerrardins many financial and
iuduf trial enterprise?, which leads .to heavy
liquidation cf high-grade K^curitips. especially
American railroad Â¦ securing. On the fac*
of a. fall in surplus reserves on Saturday of

before of $7.S91.r>53, thus cutting down nearly

and the preparations for half-yearly require

CHICAGO, June 17. â The improved tone of
Liverpool cables, coupled with a decrease in the
world's shipments of quantity on passage, gave
the wheat market a good start to-day, the July
delivery opening unchanged to %c lower, f On
covering by shorts, who were moved to action
by . reports of k big crop damage in Continental
Europe^ there was an early advance to 70%c,
at which trading was mostly of a local nature,
though there was some buying for export.' Dis
appointment was felt by the bulls over the
c>mall decrease in the visible supply and the
long wheat accumulated on the up-turn was put
out, breaking the price to 69%c. Some consid
erable purchases by the elevator people caused
a reaction to "O'.ic, at which the market closed
hie lower and fairly steady. The visible supply
decreased 162,000 bushels, against 1,640,000 bush
els the week before and 231,000 bushels a year
ago. The world's shipments of wheat and flour
were equal to S, 135, 000 bushels, and the quantity
on ocean pasage decreased 1,136,000 bushels.
The bull movement caused the notable appre
ciation in corn which was on hand at the begin
ning of business to-day, despite the reports of
a continuation of excellent weather in the corn
belt, the July option opening firm between 42%c
and 43%c and closing steady %c down at 42%c.
The oats market was more active than any
other. July closed %Â®Uc improved at 28%c.
The provision . market was dull and bare of
speculative interest. The tone was easier on. a
larger run of hogs than was expected with low
er prices. July pork closed 7%c lower and lard
closed a shade lower, with ribs 21ic down.
The leading futures' ranged as follows: .

opened firm and; then went higher on New
York support. The feature was St. Paul,
which touched 191. This advance was partly
due to covering by the bears, who have become
somewhat fearful that the recent shipments. of
the certificates of the stock to New York has
produced a shortage of 10.C0O shares here. The
main cause of the advance was the report thai
Lnion Pacific would get control of St. Paul 011
the basis of f200 in bonds for $100 par value of
St. Paul stock. This is regarded as a good
thing for St. Paul,- and the- prediction is made
that it will touch 210. The arrangement is con
sidered as . bad for Union Pacific. Tlntoa are

MASK THALL GOING EAST
. FOR P1LAYS AND PI.AYER3
Mark Thall, the well known theatrical
manager, and Charles Bryant, stage man
ager of. the Alcazar, leave to-night for
New York on business. They will be
away for two or three weeks, and during
their stay In the East will perfect plans
for reproducing a number of late New
York successes at the Alcazar and Central
theaters. Mr. Thall will also engage a
number of new people for the local stock
companies.
Â¦ : As a result of this trip the theater-goers
on this coast will have an opportunity of
seeing a very strong stock company in the
latest and most popular plays. It is the
intention of Messrs. Belasco, Thall and
Mayer to form a chain of theaters In the
big. cities on this coast. It will not be In
the nature of a trust, but simply a com
bination to enlarge the theatrical field
and give certain cities the benefit of their
successful experience in running stock
houses. It will be their -purpose to keep
strong stock companies on the road and
play at the various theaters under their
control.
During Mr. Thall's absence In the East
Fred Belasco and Maurice E. Mayer will
look after the two local show houses.
Among many leading Republicans who>
actively participated in the prolonged Sen
atorial contest at Sacramento and made
a gallant and successful fight to maintain
the honor of the State there are several
who seem determined to ascertain,
whether our senior Senator, George C.
Perkins, proposes to recognize their serv
ices as valuable to the party. Last Fri
day State Senators Belshaw, Caldwell and
Smith ha< a heart-to-heart talk with the
United Staft* Senator who dwells In Ala
meda County and expects that county to
send to the Legislature a delegation,
pledged to use all honorable means to
bring about his re-election to the United
States Senate." Plain language was used
at the conference. The State Senators at
the conclusion of the interview expressed
the opinion that Senator Perkins would
respect the wishes of Republicans who
haa opposed boss rule in party affairs.
It was readily perceived that the Sen
ator would, prefer to go right along and
make the contest for his re-election on the>
basis of his own personal fitness and- past
service without touching the principles of
party Integrity which were recognizei In
.the. battle which culminated in the elec
tion of Senator Bard, but the visiting del
egation contended that the Senator should
come fairly into line with the anti-boss
forces of the State and assist In upholding
the principles of good government and
clean politics. . .
There was no demand that Republicans
who opposed the election of Senator Bard
should be turned down and Ignored, but
there was a demand that Federal office
holders who went to Sacramento and.
made themselves offensively conspicuous
in the advocacy of boss methods of manip
ulating the Legislature should not be re
appolnted to office.
As a general proposition Senator Per
kins is in favor of reappointlng or retain
ing in service for an Indefinite length of
time the present regime of Federal office
holders. Frank Leach's four years' term
as Superintendent of the Mint expired last
week. W. W. Montague's four years'
term as Postmaster of San Francisco will
expire next week. There are no indica
tions and no demand for a change In
either office. John P. Irish, Naval Officer,
and Joseph S. Spear, Surveyor of Cus
toms, will probably serve throughout
President McKinley's administration. The
term for which United States Marshal
Shine was commissioned will not expire
until next year. John C. Lynch'a term as
Collector of Internal Revenue will expire
within two months. The offices of Col
lector of the Port and United States At
torney for the Northern District of Cali
fornia were recently filled by appoint
ment. J. M. Gleaves, United States Sur
veyor General, and Charles Bassett.
United States* Shipping Commissioner, are
willing to keep right along In the service.

STHAIGHT TALK
TO THE SENATOR
SARANAC LA.KE, N. Y.,- June 17.âSo
cial and religious circles nere were elec
trified yesterday morning directly after
church, when the news, got abroad that
Rev. William Tatlock, pastor of the Pres
byterian church, was to be challenged to
a duel to the death by Harry Gilmore,
son of Colonel Gilmore of v the regular
army. The rumor was immediately veri
fied by young Gilmore, who, instead of
going to church, spent the morning hurry
ing around Saranac in search j of friends
to act as seconds. A friend of Tatlock
Bald late last night:- '.
Â¦ 'T.' hear from Gilmore's headquarters
that he is now writing out a formal, chal
lenge. How Tatlock will treat it I don't
know. I believe,) however, that the pastor
has already written an account of the en
tire matter to Gilmore's mother, and it
is quite likely that if neither of the com
batants Is killed In the contest one, at
least, of them will get spanked. If, as we
all hope, Tatlock accepted Gilmore's chal
lenge, I know at least two of his elders
who will act : as seconds on the field."
; Injthe meantime all Saranac -1st torn up
.over the prospect of. such a sensational
event as a real duel. Mr, Gilmore is pre
paring for a West Point examination and
Tatlock has served him. In the- capacity
of tutor. The misunderstanding is the re
sult of a disagreement over a- question In
mathematics., . .â¢ ; \ â¢ .-. .
Son ,of Colonel Gilmore
K Out for His Tutor's-
Life-Blood.
The third lecture of the series -which is
being delivered by Dr. Benjamin de Costa
drew a large audience' last" night : to
Metropolitan Temple. In treating his sub
ject, which was " "The Bible Among the
Masses of the American -People," the
eloquent speaker argued that the Catholic
Church is the only true exponent of the
Bible, as the infallible word of God, and
Â¦that the church had always interpreted
it in the light of progress and* .true
science. He vigorously defended the
teachings of the holy book against the at
tacks of the high critics. ...
Rev. Father Peter C. Yorke presided
and in his introductory remarks p,aicl' a
high compliment to the ability and worth
of Dr. de Costa, saying that there are
none more able than he to . defend tho
Bible. At the conclusion of Dr. de Costa' s
address, Father Yorke took occasion to
make a few remarks,. ._ in which he
vehemently criticized the modern press,
stating that in. their columns might be
seen side by side reports of sermons and
sensational stories.. He, argued that the
Â¦^papers should -keep outr-of the pulpit and
the sanctuary^-': ; ,; \ â¢ Â¦â¢â¢- i
Dr. dfe Costa- spoke^ in part -as follows:
' .It has been declared .by some of 'the modern
scholars that no person .'of. education accepts
the teachings of. the Bible as Infallible. ; Then
Leo XIII is uneducated; then all .the graduates
pf the colleges and . seminaries, and all the
clergy of the world are. uneducated. 1 ; v ; i.
Catholic -Church Can Defend Bible.
. The non-Catholics can . make no defense of
their doctrines because : their beliefs are. not
definitely outlined. They, cannot defend the
Bible, because they know- not what part of it
to defend. . On the other hand . the Catholic
Church can defend the entire Bible as the in
fallible word of. God. For a long time before
I became a convert I saw in the distance the
strong walls of the Catholic Church and deemed
'them impregnable. The non-Catholics have de
fended the Bible until they have destroyed it;
juntil they have driven 50,000,000 people in this
country to disbelieve in its teachings.
\ The Catholic Church has always interpreted
;the Bible in accordance with progress and the
spirit of the age. It wages no conquest be
tween religion and true science.' Around the
Bible the church has built. a wall more Im
pregnable ' than . the Emperors of Rome ever
built around the Imperial City. If we allow a
single doubt to be cast upon any of the teach
ings of the Bible, the whole book Is swept
away. The church is its natural guardian. It
haa been said that the Bible, next to the sac
raments, is most sacred. . Then . as a matter
of right the church should be its guardian, as
it is the administrator of the sacraments.
Need of an Instructor.
. The Bible does not teach infallible truths to
all. In the use of the Bible we need an in
structor, just as we need an instructor in the
use of a medicine chest. No one of you would
po into a pharmacy and. attempt to order drugs
without competent medical advice.
'TWere is not a line or a sentence anywhere
In the Bible that proclaims that It Is superior
to the church. The Lord exhorted His Apostles
to go forth and instruct the people 'with their
voices. The Bible everywhere exhorts us to
listen to the teachings of the church. Down
.to the sixteenth century.no one ever heard

Actor and Actress Wed.
CHICAGO, June 17.â Miss May Hosmer,
the actress, and George R. Fiske, actor
and singer, were married here to-day.
ment to-night before Notary W. J. Morti
mer, saying:
"This evening Miss Adams came to
Thomas S. Allen's house at 2101 Hearst
avenue, where I reside, and requested
! me to go with her to her home to pro
tect her from her father's abuse. I en
tered the. house with her and walked Into
-a bedroom, where I was met by her father,
Charles Adams. I did not threaten him
or show him any violence. I simply told
him that he must not abuse, his daugh
ter, whereupon Charles Adams shot me.
I then jumped on him and smashed his
! face and beat the devil out of him."
Miss Adams is 22 years of age. She and
her brother Carl, 10 years old, were cared
for at the White residence. Miss Vera
White said:
"Miss Adams was in constant fear of
her father. He has been crazy drunk most
of the time-since they have been here
and has had delirium tremens. He beat
Miss Adams, and she was afraid that he
would kill her. She is prostrated and In a
very low condition."
At the Receiving Hospital Adams made
the following statement:
Claims He Was Justified.
"Jessup and I are the best of friends,
but he interfered in my business and I
shot him. I told him I would shoot him.
My daughter let him into the house and
I heard him coming up the stairs. I was
in my room at the time. I took my pistol
and went to the head of the stairs and
warned Jessup not to come up. I told
him I was irresponsible, that I was in an
angry mood and that I would shoot, .but
he kept right on coming. Then to avoid
trouble I backed into my room, though
still pointing the pistol at him.
"When he got to the threshold of my
door I thought it was time to act, so I
fired one shot. I kept telling him not to
come, but he did not heed me. I had no
intention of killing him. He was the last
man In the world I would have killed.
That was why I shbt him where I did. I
aimed for his left shoulder. I fired only
one shot. I had five others that I could
have fired, but ray object was only to stop
him. The revolver is a Smith & Wesson
that I've had years.
"As soon as I fired Jessup ran toward
me and grappled me around the body. I
didn't make much of a resistance. Jes
sup gave me a terrible beating with the
butt end of my own pistol. I don't blame
him a bit. I hope he recovers and I'm
sorry that I had to shoot him, but when
a man interferes with another man that's
what he gets. . ' â¢Â¦
Praises Man He Shot.
"Jessup and 1 are old friends. He is
a perfect gentleman. I don't think he
ever did a wrong thing In his life. But
he uid interfere with me, and interference
in my affairs I will not brook. There was
one thing that I resented, and that was
Jessup's attentions to my daughter. He
is a married man with a daughter of his
own, though his wife is separated from
him. But then that was not why I shot
Jtssup. I would not have shot him . on
that account, because I consider him per
fectly honorable. There was nothing in
the doctor's action to create suspicion
and nothing in my daughter's actions
that were reprehensible. I will stand by
my daughter's charactetr, and I will
stand by Jessup's character.
"I'm all right, but I hate to be dis
turbed when I'm drunk. I've been drunk
almost right along now for two years. I
left the ministry because I couldn't- get
drunk when I wanted to, and I've been
drinking ever since."
Drink Ruined Him.
Adams was taken to the .County Jail
after his wounds were dressed* He Is 51
years of age, a native of New York. He
was ordained into the diaconate of the
Episcopal church in Ohio in 1872, and be
came a priest three years later. Of much

seriously considered. From, any other
standpoint It is simply a hopeless hurly

It proved an unqualified success. Mac-

The character of Marcello Almerio. whose

MYSTERY VEILS
THE DISASTER
Railroad Officials Inves
% tigate the Wreck
at Napa. V,'-
NAP A, June 17.â There Is still much
mystery about the cause of the disaster
to the Napa Valley train .near the sta
tion here last evening, and all the efforts'
of railroad detectives have not been re
warded with anything, like an adequate
explanation. The opinion of the railroad
men who work here that some person 'or
persons deliberately sought to destroy the
train has not suffered any change by rea
son of the developments to-day. It has
been suggested that the changing of the
switch may be ascribed to the careless
ness of some railway employe, but the
majority of people who have investigated
the affair refuse to accept this theory. ,
Special Agent Meloney of the Southern
Pacific Company arrived here early to
day and at once began an Inquiry: as to
the circumstances attending the disaster.
He spent several hours in questioning em
ployes and in an inspection of the track.
The results of. his inspection were not
made known, and he went back to San
Francisco on an afternoon train. . .
It was reported to-day that several per
sons whose conduct at the time seemed
suspicious were seen near the switch
south of the station a short time before
the train from Valle jo arrived- and 'ran
into the freight cars. The story *was only
partially verified, however, and Constable
George Secord, who had charge of Â¦' this
part of -the investigation, is inclined to
doubt the truth of it. ; " Â¦
It Is the opinion of the constable that
the- negligence of a railroad - employe
caused, the wreck, but he can assign no
reason r why three trains ' : should have
passed safely before the. disaster if the
switch was out of order. The lock was
found closed after the wreck, ' and this
fact would indicate that a person owning
a key- and familiar with the mechanism
tampered with it at some time in. the af
ternoon. -' '

Former Episcopal Priest Uses
Pistol in a Fit of Drunken *
Frenzy.
Dentist Attempts to Prevent Father
From Abusing His Daughter and
Receives a Probably Fatal
Wound.
BERKELEY. June 17.-Charles G.
Adams, an unfrocked Episcopal clergy
man, shot and probably fatally wounued
Dr. John G. Jessup, a Berkeley dentist,
at 7 o Â¥ clock this evening. The shooting
occurred at the Adams residence. 1801
Walnut street, where the dentist had gone
to protect Miss Agnes S. Adams from
abuse and beating by her father. Sum
moned to the Adams home by the young
woman, who had fled to him for succor.
the dentist returned with the girl and
started into the bedroom on the upper
floor.
Adams, armed with a revolver and half
crazed from liquor, met the doctor on the
landing and ordered him back. Jessup
expostulated with the parent, who sud
denly raised the pistol and fired. The bul
let plowed through Jessup'6 right lung.
The doctor, staggered by the impact.
Fturnbled back, but recovered himself
quickly. He leaped upon Adams, threw
him down and wrenched the smoking
weapon from his hand. Then to subdue
his intoxicated assailant Jessup ham
mered blow after blow with the butt o*
the pistol upon the ex-preacher's head.
Weakened by the effort and the hem
orrhage from his wound. Jessup staggered
out of the room and downstairs, and fell
fainting upon the front porch, where he
was picked up by John Armstrong, one
of a crowd of neighbors who were at
tracted by the pistol shot. .
Adams Surrenders Himself.
Jessup Makes a Statement.
Miss Adams ran out of the house after
the shooting and sought shelter at Mrs.
Charles White's residence, next door.
Adams locked himself in the bedroom and
remained there for fifteen minutes, until
Town Marshal Charles Kerns arrived.
Then in response to the demand of the
l^ace officer Adams surrendered himself.
He was covered with blood from the
wounds upon his face and head and was
taken at once to the Receiving Hospital
in Oakland, where his injuries were
dressed. His Ho was split open and his
scalp was cut and torn in several places.
Adams was iiitoxicated when he was
taker, to the hospital and his story was
rambling- and incoherent, principally -con
lined to denials of abuse of his daughter.
Dr. Jessup was removed after the shoot-
Ing to his rooms in the residence of
Thomas S. Alien at 2101 Hearst avenue.
Dr. O. B. Hoagland and Dr. J. S. East
man attended the wounded man and
found that the bullet had entered the left
lung above the heart and had lodged under
the left shoulder blade. The wound is an
extremely dangerous one and the chances
arf against Jessup' s recovery.
The shooting to-night is the culmination
cf a long period of abusive conduct of the
former cleric toward his daughter, who
had often told her friends that she feared
her father when In his cups would kill
her. Frequently she had gone to Jessup
Tor protection when her father, 'in his
drunken ugliness, became dangerously
violent. In his whisky-crazed condition
to-night he threatened the girl, and she
ran out to find a protector. Such is her
etcry.
Dr. Jessup made an ante-mortem state-
LOS GATOS, June 17.â Three thousand
excursionists attended the picnic held here
tÂ«--day under the auspices of the Bunker
Hill Association, the Sons of the American
Revolution, the California Association of
Pioneers and the St, Albans Literary and
Social Society.
i The excursionists arrived on two sec
tions of a broad-guage train at 11:30
o'clock and proceeded to Bunker Hill
Park. Here literary exercises were held.
The opening number was a medley of pa
triotic airs rendered by the Second Regi
ment Band. A prayer was offered by
Rev. T. J. Lacey, the chaplain of the day.
After a few oDening remarks by Hon.
William G. Badger and vocal muBic, con
sisting of "The Star Spangled Banner" by
Wiss Juliet Greninger and "The Sword of
Bunker Hill" by O. Lafayette Lienau, the
; oration of the day was delivered bv Col
; onel E. F. Preston. The sneaker ex
jpatiated on the event that the celebration
â¢Â¦ commemorated and traced the progress of
! the nation from that time to the present.
The address was a masterly one and
elicited liberal applause from the audi
ence. It was followed by a song, "Red,
White and Blue," by Emil Barrangon and
"The Marseillaise" by Miss Grace I. Sav
age. The audience then sang "America"
; aria the exercises were closed by a bene
; diction by the chaplain.
i Most of the excursionists brought lunch
I with them and tables were spread under
j neath the oak trees of the park. Those
I vho did not come prepared had their
| wants well supplied by the local hotels
and the ladies of the Presbyterian church,
who took advantage of the occasion to
swell their organ fund by a lunch. After
j lunch the athletic contests were called.
The contests were managed by a com
mittee consisting of Robert Collier, J. S.
Miller and "W. B. Kohn. The prizes were
donated by San Francisco merchants and
were awarded to the successful contest
ants by Lee D. Windrem. Phil J. Euler
and Hugh Clark, who acted as judges.
This is the third time these patriotic so
cieties have met in Los Gatos, the first
occasion being three years ago, when the
park was dedicated and given the name
of Bunker Hill Park.

gallant defense of Bunker Hill on June
17, 1775, but in respect to the valor of
New England men who fought so gallant

occasion every recurring anniversary of
the event is fitly observed in San Fran
cisco by a general display of American
flags. Yesterday the starry banner was
flung to the breeze from many a building
in the city. In promoting the spirit of
national pride in the achievement at
Bunker Hill the association deriving its
name from the battle-field has performed

GRAPE-lfUTS.
COULD NOT WOO.
A Goddess That Would Not Be Won.
The Creator in making so many klnd3
of people naturally made some that have
immense ambition and desire for work,
physical and mental. Authors, writers
and brain workers are generally hard
Â¦working people: frequently they exhaust
vitality fo fast that they cannot rebuild.
Food experts have perfected a special
food called Grape-Nuts for brain work-
ers. The makers selected from field grains
the proper dements which naturally en-
ter into rebuilding brain and nerve cen-
ters.
A famous woman of West Haven,
Conn., whom perhaps you will recognize
because of the location, but who requests
that her name be kept from print in this
connection, writes: "Perhaps you would
like to know of my experience with the
restoring power of your wonderful Grape-
Nuts Food. I have been a tireless work-
er. Life was full of possibilities. I had
a constitution of Iron, and why not work.
I lived to the fullest limit of my power,
following every pursuit with ardor, paint-
ing, poetry, writing of books. Journalism
and lecturing.
"The days were passed in literary work
and the nights at concerts, theaters and
receptions. I suddenly dropped out, a
mental ard physical wreck. Ambition
died s.nd hope '.vent with it. Religion be-
came odious. The world grew dark. It
became a 'charnel. house full of unclean
bones, not Godlike and our Father's.'
"I had no desire for food. I could not
woo the 'goddess sleep that knits up the
raveled sleeve tf care.' I contemplated a
urjk solution, a leap into the unknown,
when one day a friend In Yale who knew
my deplorable condition said, 'Do you
know that Grare-Nuts Food has done' a
great deal for meT ana told the details. I
finally followed his suggestion and began
using it. That was one year ago. I? wish
you could see me now. The neighbors say
I do the work of ten women. I go to bed
Â¦with the hens and sleep like a top.
"I hear "the breeze call of Incense
breathing morn/ my muscles are like
iron, and my back of steel. I am as alert
as the sparrow, with whom I converse
every morning as he seeks his matutinal
worm.
"I ascribe all of this change, and Justly,
to Grape-Nuts Food and wisdom in the
economy of force "
There is a good, sound reason for such
s change as described above. Grape-
Nuts Food is made of the selected ele-
ments of wheat and barley that are in-
tended by nature to rebuild the soft gray
matter in the brain and nerve cells
throughout the body. This food is so pre-
pared: that it presents these elements In
perfect condition for immediate assimila-
tion. The food is thoroughly cooked at
the factory, and should always be served
Just as it comes from the package with a
little cream. Do not attempt to stew it,
but serve it w'thout cooking except when
comhlned with certain puddings and des-
serts, and even then the cooking Is not
necesrary except to prepare the other In-
rredients aside from the Grape-Nuts.

can't eat,' and the gums have a spongy; unnatural appearance, you are told to stop
and a change to Potash is made.' When the stomach rebels you are put on Mercury
again; and so on ad in/iniium,'ox until the system becomes so thoroughly saturated
with these" poisonous drugs that the most disgusting sores break out on the body,
the bones' become diseased, and the muscles and joints are racked with the most
torturing pains." Mercury and Potash drive the eruptions and blotches from the
skin, but the virus remains in the blood and the reappearance of the old symptoms
and the occasional sore. mouth show that the poison is still active, and you can
never hope to completely eradicate it by this method of treatment.

Mr. Brodrick, the' War Secretary, said
there were 40,229 persons in the concen
tration camps of the Transvaal and Or

camps for the month of May . numbered
98 men and women and 31S children. The

ceived with groans from â¢ the Irish mem
i.bers and cries of "scandalous!" Â» . . :
Mr. Brodrick.- added that the authori
ties were arranging for the release .of the
women and children who had friends to
receive them, but the Government 'could
not undertake to feed " them, in Isolated
places. . â¢ â¢ Â¦ . ' 'â¢ . - Â¦
The division- in the House, of Commons
on the motion made by Mr. Lloyd-George,
Welsh Nationalist, to adjourn the House
on the xjuestion of the treatment of Boer
women and children, which was rejected
by a voteof 253 to X3-C served to accentu- ;
ate the split in the Liberal party on the
Government's war policy. Â» Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman. the- Liberal -leader,
supported Mr. Lloyd-George in the policy
of concentrating women and children' in
camps, and. with Sir William Vernon Har
court. Liberal, and Riffht Hon. William
Brice, Liberal, voted in the minority on
Mr. Lloyd-George's motion. About fifty

Sir Edward Grey, Liberal, abstained from
voting as a. protest against the Banner

Boers. Â¦ Â¦Â¦ -j ' . Â¦ .â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢ ;

W. H. Mills Enthusiastic
Over California's Fine
W. H. Mills, who has charge of the Cali
fornia exhibit at the Pan-American Expo
sition, has returned home. fora stay of a
month or more. He is enthusiastic over
the splendid showing that California has
made and says that it is the finest State
exhibit at the exposition, and that great
results are sure to come of it.
"The exhibitions from California," he
.said/ "are. not alone restricted to the in
dustries but:we also exploit our possibili
ties. For instance, we show fruit, grain
and forestry, but we also have on exhibi
tion samples . of silk and pineapples to
show visitors what California is capable
of doing. - .
"The California, exhibition is, the talk
of the fair and. the attendants of the
California department are busy: all tho
time answering questions . and giving in
formation." The attendance at the Pan-
American Exposition is- good now, but in
the fall, when the harvesting is over, the
numbers will increase 'enormously.' The
buildings are all" completed and the elec
tric display Is the finest that" has' ever
been attempted. .There are three splendid
bjinds on the grounds, Sousa's, the Mexi
can and the Seventy-second - Regiment
band. The : midway features are most in
teresting, many novel performances being
introduced. The Indians give a mock bat
tle-that Is most : realistic, about 600{par
ticipating in the event. Â¦ 'The South Before
the Â¦War', is also apopular feature of the
midway." . â¢Â¦ Â¦ Â¦Â¦ .:, .
. Mr. Â¦ Mills will return to the exposition
in August and remain there until the clos
ing of the fair in-November. <-- Â¦ --Â¦

Slight .differences between the late strik
ing - butchers who returned to work and
their employers caused a temporary riffle
of excitement yesterday at the Turk
street Temple, where headquarters of the
Journeymen Butchers' Union were main
tained. Nothing serious developed, and it
was reported that the majority of the
strikers had been employed again. Ex
ceptions were made in some instances, but
these were entirely of an individual char
acter. Everything was finally made har
monious, and those who were most active
in promoting the strike were told to "call
again."
At the headquarters of the ironworkers
Secretary Wisler reported that two shops
nad been unionized during the day and
about forty-nve ironworkers had resumed
their old positions. As to any disaffection
in the ranks of the strikers, he said that
reports to that effect had been so often
circulated that he was tired of denying
them. Â¦ About fifty men not connected,
with the local organizations of iron
workers went to worK yesterday and more
are expected to take the place of the
striking machinists to-day in various
shops.
"In the two shops orgunized to-day,"
'said Secretary Wisler, "the full demands
of the union have been granted and we
expect further accessions. The men are
slowly_ gaining all their demands."
The ~ executive committee of Beer
Drivers' Union No. 27 adopted a provis

State. -An election i committee was ap
pointed to supervise - the general election

have taken union cards and union crews, and
the number of union window cards now in use
is rapidly approaching the four hundred mark.
Hotels are also rapidly unionizing:.
Business Agent Wllle of the Bakers' Union
reported that employers are using- . desperate
measures to get the bakers to go back to
work, but without success. Shares in the co
operative bakery are selling- rapidly, and in a
week the Advance Co-operative Bakery will be
in a position to set many of the union mem
bers to work who are now on strike. -
Business Agent Sganzinl reported that the
Italian bakers are working- a six-day week,
with the exception of about seven employes of
three non-union concerns.
Information received from Oakland showed
that the Cooks' and Walters' Union there Is
In a snlendid condition. The six-day week is
won both for cooks and waiters, the union
cards are displayed in the windows and the
union has assessed its members 50 cents per
week to .assist the . cocis and waiters of San
Francisco.
In view of the fact that the treasury of the
Cooks' and "Walters* Union was in a better
condition than one week agro, it was resolved
to increase the force of pickets In front of the
unfair restaurants.
The cooks and waiters now regard the strike
as virtually . won, only a few non-union res
taurants being left to be unionized. Members
are paying their assessments willingly and
support Is coming in from the East. A break
in the - ranks of the Restaurant Keepers' Asso
ciation Is ' expected at any time, as the boy
cott is bsKlnnlng to be effective, public opin
ion being now wholly in favor of the cooks and
waiters. J. C. LANE, Secretary

With Few Exceptions
Butchers Return to
Work.
F. G... Coburn was brought to the City
Prison yesterday afternoon bySecret Ser
vice Agent Hazen and Operator Moffitt
and locked .up in the tanks pending his
surrender to the United States Marshal
to-day.
Coburn came to this city from Manila
on the transport Kilpatrick last February
and called at the United States secret
service office in quest of employment, he
representing himself as a secret service
agent of the Government in Manila and
Honolulu. He showed a letter of recom
mendation purporting to have been signed
by Alfred Wilkie, chief of the United
States Secret Service Â¦ Bureau at Wash
ington, recommending Coburn as a first
class detective and stating that Coburn
had been in the service of the Govern
ment for twelve.years. He also exhibited
a letter from LieutenaTit Trowbridge at
Manila certifying that Coburn had acted
as a duly authorized sercret service agent
there. Another letter purported to be
from Jules Uri- at Honolulu and certified
that Coburn had been in charge of the
bubonic plague quarantine for the Gov
ernment. .
Chief Hazen put himself in communica
tion with Chief "Wilkie and was informed
that Coburn was a faker and that the
Wilkie letter was a forgery. Yesterday
Coburn called at Hazen's office again and
was detained, by Operator Harry Moffitt
until Mr. Hazen appeared and arrested
him, Coburn admitted that the Wilkie
letter was' forged, but said that a friend
of his had signed Wilkie's name. He ran
a board bill in Woodland, Yolo County,
lately, representing himself as a Govern
ment official. Coburn will be charged
with impersonating a , United States of

HAZEH BEARDED
IN HIS OFFICE
Turk street, while Doneghy had all' his
literature and 1 tickets for his* schemes
printed by the man Hutchinson, who runs
a '.'boys' . home" and a job printing office
on Treat avenue. < The Associated Chari
ties are now. investigating Hutchinson's
"home.". â¢ .--â¢....
The "Associated Charities,' which Is or
ganized to, prevent fraud on the charit
ably inclined citizens, is determined to use
every effort to prevent such frauds as
those perpetrated by Doneghy, Mamlock
and Mrs. Gregory. - :
J The Merchants' Association, realizing
that the business community has been
constantly duped by scheming men and
women, ,will . shortly take some definite
steps ' to protect the community. While
there is a natural hesitancy on the part
of those duped to come to the front and
admit that they have been defrauded, all
will- eagerly join in any proposal to pre
vent a repetition of the "charity work
ers " schemes, "s _ â¢
President J. C. Salisbury . of . the Boys'
an <? Girls ' Aid - Society of Los Angeles
will probably be requested by the police
to come to this city and testify in the
prosecution of the Doneghy-Barnes-
Mamlock gang,- who are under arrest.
Mamlock on Sunday last asserted that
his proposed concert was for the benefit
of Mr. Salisbury's society. When he knew
that The Call intended telegraphing to
Los Angeles to find out if his statement
was true, he realized that his game was
up and disappeared.
The schemers arrested yesterday will be
arraigned .before Police Judge Fritz tRis
morning.
' Doneghy was released on $100 cash bail
at 1:30 this morning:.
- Mamlock also admitted on Sunday that
Doneghy. had kept all his .books and pa
pers in his (Mamlock's) rooms. and at the
time he spoke he pointed to v a locked
trunk and said: "The books and papers
are in there.? Testerday the trunk was
wide-open and the books and papers of
Doneghy were gone, showing that on
Sunday night Mamlock had warned
Doneghy that an arrest might follow and
. to i take i his papers away. Â¦ â¢
The detectives last night were of the
opinion that Doneghy had given all in
criminating evidence to Helen Barnes to
take with her to Sacramento, and that it
is in a valise awaiting the owner in the
baggage-room of the ferry depot. Â¦. A
search for the valise will be made to
day. . " Â¦ _ " . Â¦ " - Â¦
Now that the police have some of the
charity workers" under arrest, no op
portunity will be lost to bring the rest
of the unsavory band into the drag-net
of ,the law. Mrs. K. C. Gregory, alias
Miss, C. C. Graham, who was formerly
associated with Doneghy, will be
watched. Many of the women who
worked for Doneghy, Mamlock and Mrs.
Gregory belong to this city and were
made dupes of by the schemers.
These women answered advertisements
and secured -employment from the lead
ers of the bands of schemers and there is
no evidence to show that they knew of
the baseness -of the work they were en
gaged in.
The. police have the names of some of
the womten, and their testimony can be
'secured if necessary. The same applies
Doneghy Kept Mamlock's Books.
I that of. Helen" Barnes at" the Lag Palmag
. rooming-house were also searched ! and
m Â°re evidence was secured there. '
The police are of the opinion that there
Â¦^"l be: little difficulty in securing a con
viction of all the arrested persons. While
Doneghy. and -Helen Barnes claim that
they were not connected with Mamlock's
bogus scheme for a concert, there is
ample evidence- to show that the - two
bands worked together and knew .'of each
other s plans. . Mamlock fully admitted
having launched the olan to give a-con
cert for the "California Boys" and' Qirls'
Aid Society" and his tickets .were sold
by Julie Howie, Mrs. C. E.' Wifcox,
Isabelle McDonald and Belle Smith. The
women admitted on Sunday that they
5 sold the tickets all over the business por
tion of the city. v
Some of Mamlock's tickets were found
on, Sunday morning in the desk occupied
by Dpneghy in room 612, Emma Spreckels
building and witnesses will be produced
to^prove that X>oneghy. Helen Barnes
and Mamlock dally met in Doneghy's of
fice and discussed, the. concert scheme.
