Influence With the Disturbed

Special Dlssatch, to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â Chile may
follow Argentina's example and refer the
controversy between them to the King of
England for arbitration. Even should this
action be taken, however, the relations
of the two countries are 6O strained that
. the authorities do not believe that war
can be averted.
The feeling in both countries is running
high and the slightest incident may pro
voke hostilities. The conditions existing
in South America are well known to Sec
retary Hay, who has received advices
from American Ministers at Santiago and
Buenos Ayres and who was in conference
to-day with Minister Merou, representing
Argentina, and Infante, the Chilean Charge
d'Affaires. Minister Wilson at Santiago
wired Secretary Hay to-day that he still
hopes that peace will prevail. Both dip
lomatic representatives of the South
American republics in Washington pub
licly insist that hostilities will be avoided.
At the same time it is known that their
Governments are making extensive prep- t
arations for war and are ready to strike :
the moment they believe action Is im- j
perative.
Say Works for Peace.
It was stated at the State Department j
to-day that no representations involving
action by the United States were made
to-day to Secretary Hay. The Secretary
is using: his Influence, however, on the
side of peace and is prepared to take any
action compatible with the dignity and
interests of this country to effect a peace
ful settlement of the trouble.
The authorities are hopeful that the
reference of the controversy to the King j
of England will result in the maintenance ,
of peace, but it is feared that Chile will !
be incensed over the arbitrary action of
Argentina and will hesitate to follow her
example.
Great Britain Is Anxious.
LONDON, Dec. 23. â The British Govern
ment is watching the progress of the dis
pute between the Chilean and Argentine
governments with much anxiety. It was
said to-day that neither side has yet ap
proached the British Foreign Office. If
both Chile and Argentina request Great
Britain to arbitrate the matters in dis
pute between them Lord Lansdowne, the
Foreign Secretary, will promptly ac-
Quiesce.
The statement of Dr. Alcorta. the Ar
gentine Minister of Foreign Affairs, that
Argentina has referred the matter to the
arbitration of the British Government
under the agreement of 1S08, appears to
be inaccurate, for the Foreign Office says
the present contention is quite beyond the
powers of that commission. As the For
eign Office understands the case it is not
one relative to the boundary between the
two countries, but whether Chile has the
right to build neutral roads in the dis
puted territory. This commission, of
â which Lord MacNaughton is president,
has been sitting In London for nearly two
years and is now almost ready to go and
personally inspect the disputed bound
aries. For various reasons, iiowever, the
departure of this " commission has been
delayed and is likely to be delayed for
eome time to tome.
The appeal of Dr. Alcorta has not yet
been officially communicated to the Brit
ish Foreign Office
1 Public War Spirit.
BUENOS AYRES, Dec. 23.â The pa
triotic demonstrations growing out of the
possibility of war with Chile were renewed
here to-day. The Chilean Minister here,
Senor Concha Subercaseaux, has not re
ceived any instructions in regard to the
course he Is to pursue.
It Is estimated that the maintenance of
-the army, which will be moHilized by Feb
ruary 5. will involve an annual expense of
C5.000.000 piasters. About 8000 men have
already signed the rolls of the Uruguayan
Volunteer Legion.
A dispatch from Santiago says Presi
dent Riesco has declared that the recall
of the Argentine Minister, Senor Portel,
from that place cannot have any serious
consequences, adding that the Minister in
returning to Argentina Is taking advan
tage of a leave of absence which has
bekn granted him by his Government.
President Riesco continues confident
that the negotiations in progress will
ehortly result in a pacific solution ct the
problem now engrossing the attention of
*he statesmen of Argentina and Chile.
Colonel Pablo Riccherl, the Minister of
War, has Informed President Roca that
he has a\-allable GOO locomotives and 4300
cars, and that on forty-eight hours' no
tice hÂ« can transport 80,000 men to the
frontier..

CAR BREAKS AWAY AT BROADWAY AND DASHES DOWN HILL
AT TERRIFIC PAGE, COLLIDING WITH CAR AT GREEN STREET
Two-Thirds of the Passengers Who Are Aboard Suffer Broken
Bones or Lacerated Wounds as the Result of the Awful Trip
on the Runaway Down the Precipitous and Dangerous Incline
A FILLMORE street electric car
failed to make proper connec
tions with the. complicated
gravity apparatus at the top
of the steep grade between
Broadway and Green street
last night, shortly after 7
o'clock, and speeding down the hill
crashed into a car at the bottom of
the grade, and brought death to one wo
man and serious injury to a half score of
passengers. The accident was one of the
most serious street car fatalities that has
decurred in the city for some years.
Miss Mary Phelan, a servant girl in the
employ of Edward Litchenberg, 2520
Green street, was the only passenger on
the car that made the mad dash down
the hill that succumbed to her injuries.
She received injuries to- her skull and
body that caused her death shortly after
being removed to the Railroad Hospital
at the corner of Fourteenth and Mission
streets. Mary Kelly, also a servant
girl in Mr. Lltchenberg's employ, was
badly Injured. Mrs. M. K. Mansie also
sustained Injuries that may result fatal
ly. Fully ten or fifteen other passengers
whose names could not be learned were
more or less Injured by flying glass and
splinters and the terrible shock!.
Whether or not. the accident was due
to criminal negligence on the part of the â 
crew of car No. 757, which dashed down
the hill, will not be known until after an
Investigation has been made by the offi
cials. The most likely theory is that both
the crew and the gravity apparatus which
lets the cars up and down the hill were
at fault. A sllcht accident at the corner
of California and Fillnrore streets about
7 o'clock in the evening threw the running
schedule of the Fillmore street line out
of kilter and unfortunately when the run
away car arrived at the top of the hill
there was no car there to take the pas
sengers.
Car Slips Hold on Track.
There were two cars at the bottom of
the hill at Green and Fillmore streets,
one on â  the opposite track â  waiting; to be

hauled up by the down-coming car and
another at the switch at that point be
tween the two tracks. The car at the
top of the hill had about fifteen pas
sengers aboard. The conductor got out
of the car and started to hook up the
gravity apparatus which lets the car
down the hill at a moderate, rate of speed,
when the car suddenly slipped its hold
on the track and started on its wild run
down toward Union street, three blocks
below. .../... .

The crews of the two cars at the bottom
of the hill saw the runaway car start on
Its wild run' and they yelled to the pas
sengers of their cars to flee for their
lives. The men, women and children in
the cars at the bottom of the grade had
time to hie themselves to places of safety,
but the people aboard the runaway car
did not even have a chance to lump for
their lives. The car raced swiftly,
down the hill and at Green street* it,
dashed with mighty force into the car on
the switch, throwing it from the track
as if it were. a cigar box and completely
smashing in its left side. Then the run
away, with its load of human freight,
left the track and pounded over the cob
blestones at a terrible rate of speed until
it collided with a telegraph pole just
above Union street. All of the passengers
on the outside who were not thrown from
the car when it collided with the one on
the switch were pitched with violent force
into the street, and those on the inside
were horribly bruised and mangled

people "who live in the neighborhood
where the accident occurred lent willing
hands to aid the injured and the dying.
From the front part of the .splintered
wreck the bleeding and unconscious vic
tims were extricated. Those that were
sitting on the back part of the car were
not so badly injured as to need assistance
and they turned to and aided the more
unfortunate passengers. . ". ~ ' â¢' --" .
Torn and bleeding victims of the smash
up were hurried into neighboring dwell
ings and drug stores, where they were
given hasty medical attention until the
ambulances and patrol wagons arrived to
remove them to the hospitals. The North
End police station was* notified of the
frightful accident and Sergeant Tom Ellis
and a squad of police officers were de
tailed to the scene at once. They arrived
shortly ' after the accident and rendered
commendable assistance in getting the in
jured to the hospitals.
Dr. Hennesy, one of the medical corps
of the railroad company, was in the
neighborhood when the smash-up occur
red and was one of the first physicians to
arrive on the scene. He banuaged up sev
eral of the victims and stopped the flow
of blood from many a wound that might
have proved serious had he not been on
hand. \ â¢
The drug store at the corner of Union
and Fillmore streets was pressed into
service. Several of the women who were
cut and bruised were taken there and
their wounds were temporarily dressed.
Physicians who lived in the neighborhood
volunteered their services and several vic
tims who were treated for ordinary flesh
and scalp wounds went away without giv
ing their names.
The runaway car was rendered useless.
The front part of the car was smashed
to splinters and the entire running gear
wrecked beyond repair.
Railroad Official Non-Committal.
Superintendent Michael D. Stein "of the
Fillmore-street line was Interviewed soon
after the accident. He was both reticent
and nervous. He stayed en the scene of
the accident for several hours and gave
the necessary orders regarding the clear
ing of the wreck.
â¢ "Would you please inform The Call how
the accident happened?" he was asked.
"This Is a bad time to make any state
ment," he replied. "I do not want to say
anything to-night. We will have an In
vestigation to-morrow and I will then
have something to say."
â  ."Was the accident caused through the
carelessness of the street car crew or
through defective appliances?" he wa3
again asked.
"Oh, I don't know about that," he re
plied. "The motorman . has been in the
employ of the company for some time and
we have the greatest faith in him."
A number of the street car employes,
although they were very cautious in their
remarks, claimed that the street car crew
was not to blame, but that the grip tjiat
held the car was defective and' it was on
this account that the accident occurred.
As soon as the accident occurred Dr.
Walter ' B. Coffey was dispatched from
the Railroad Hospital. He responded
promptly and was soon on "the . scene of
the 'accident and made the sufferers s\s
comfortable as possible before having
them moved.
Cars Soon Run Again.
Within an hour and a half after the
accident the cars were again running' up
and down the Fillmore-street hill. The
only sign that was left of the terrible ac
cident was the runaway car, smashed
beyond all hopes of repair, standing on
the hill near Union street.' Crowds were
congregated on the hill and those who
had seen the accident or had arrived soon
after told again and again the story pf
death and buffering In trie wreck.
Miss Josephine Blgley of 719 Fillmore
street was injured in the accident. She
received a deep gash on the forehead and
also sustained severe bruises on the
back of the head. After the accident she
was taken to the residence of Walter D.
K. Gibson, 210S Broadway. At a late
hour last evening. Miss Bigley was rest
ing easily and she was considered out of
danger.
Mrs. Turner Has a Narrow Escape.
Mrs. Elizabeth Turner was one of the
few passengers aboard the runaway car
who escaped Injury. Mrs. Turner had a
narrow escape, however, for so badly was
she jarred in the collision that two dia
mond hair combs were torn out of her
hair. One of the valuable combs was
found by Policeman Geimann and re
turned to Mrs. Turner, but the other was
probably picked up by thieves, as a dili
gent search among the ruins of the car
failed to unearth the missing jewel.
As 'soon as it was learned at police
headquarters that Mary Phelan had sue-,
cumbed to her injuries Lieutenant Martin
sent* an officer out to arrest Motorman

Special Dissatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 23.â Roman Catholic cir
cles in London are much interested in two
topics, one of which is the attitude of the
Vatican toward the United States and
the other the opening of the new Roman
Catholic cathedral at Westminster.
The correspondent of the Pall Mall Ga
zette . at Rome says that the circum
stance of Cuba and the Philippines fall
ing under the jurisdiction of the United
States has been seized upon by the Vati
can to push a project dear to Pope Leo.
When he came to the pontifical throne
several countries had no representatives
accredited to the Vatican. The new Pon
tiff set himself the task of changing this.
One of the powers that has always proved
obdurate Is the United States, but nov/
with Cuba and the Philippines the Catho
lic interests are so immense it s.eems that
the Washington Government is not un-_
willing to discuss the matter. The Vati
can would meet It half way, and would
even be satisfied for the moment with a
semi-official representative. In the hope
that he would eventually be turned Into
a Minister or Einbassador, as In the case
of Russia.
Will Withdraw the Friars.
The Vatican, according to the same au
thority, has given Washington to under
stand that it will gradually withdraw th*
friars from the Philippines, substituting
American clergy, and give the Manila.
Archbishopric to Americans. It will yield
to the great desire of Catholics In the
United States to have another Cardinal.
It does not wish to do this while Cardinal
Gibbons lives, but may compromise by
creating Archbishop Ireland or Archbish
op Corrigan a Cardinal of the Curia,
which means living in Rome, should all
go right.
England Is the only other great power
yet to come into line.
Cardinal Vaughan has decided to open
the new cathedral at "Westminster on
June 29, three days after the coronation.
It will be an imposing ceremony, and the
Pope will be specially represented. Lady
Vavasour has intimated that she will pre
sent a costly mosaic of the Welsh Si.
Winefriede for the interior decoration.
Pope Receives Cardinals.
The Pope to-day received the Cardinals,
â¢who offered him their Christmas greet
ings. The Pontiff made a lengthy ad
dress, in which he condemned what he
characterized as the excessiye liberty of
thought indulged in at the present time.
He sharply criticized socialism, agitation
for divorce and hostility between different
sections of the church, and ur^ed a union
of the Christian churches.
The church, said the Pope in the courses
of his remarks, is now confronted by dif
ficulties similar to those of earlier times.
There were attempts everywhere to make
the masses enemies of the church, tho
religious orders were subjected to all
kinds of vexatious proscriptions and laws
were being passed la open defiance of
God's eternal laws.
The Pontiff said the only means of suc
cessfully combating socialism was for
Catholics to harken to and obey the in
structions of the church.
No Representative to Vatican.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â President
Roosevelt has no intention of asking
Congress for authority to appoint a rep
resentative to the Vatican. While it ia
true that church interests in Cuba and
the Philippines are large, the administra
tion does not consider there Is any reason
to have an Embassador accredited to the
Pope. In connection with church ques
tions in dependencies representations have
been made to the President through Car
dinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland. It
is unnecessary, it is claimed, for the Pope
to appoint a representative in Washing
ton, especially to .discuss Vatican affairs
with this Government.

COLON, Dec. 23.â During the absence of

meet the revolutionists.
Alban says that if the Monroe doctrine
couid be made to provide compulsory ar
bitration to settle all disputes between
Soush American republics and European
nations, it would be accepted with enthu
siasm by all those republics.
Alban also says that President Regala

CITRUS GROWERS WILL
FIGHT CUJIMINGS BILL
Proposed Reduction in Tariff a Men
ace to the Orch.ard.ists of
California.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 23.â While the
orange and lemon growers of Southern
California have been preparing to fight a
threatened disaster to their business In
the form of a proposed reciprocity treaty
with the Britisn West Indies, a new dan
ger has arisen in a bill introduced in Con
gress providing for a reduction in duties
on citrus fruits.
This bill, recently presented in the
House by Representative Cummings of
New York, has been referred to the Com
mittee on Ways and Means and ordered
to be printed. It is an amendment to the
Dingley tariff law. The tariff schedule in
this act provides that a duty of 1 cent per
pound shall be collected on Imported
oranges, lemons, limes, grape fruit, shad
' docks or pomelos. By the new bill a re
duction of S3 1-3 per cent is proposed on
oranges, while lemons are to be taxed on
the basis of bulk. IS cents per cubic foot
of capacity of box or package, which
means a reduction of more than one-half
in duty.
When informed to-day of the introduc
tion of the Cummings bill members of the
Citrus Growers' tariff committee were
greatly alarmed by the new source of dan
ger. To them was left the fight against
the reciprocity treaty ana they have been
marshaling their forces and preparing a
determined opposition to any plan to
ndmit citrus fruits grown on the islands
:U a reduction that would injure the Cali
fornia grower. The Cummings bill is
Â«-.ven a greater menace and already the
growers are preparing to fight the
threatened danger.

PARDONED BY GOVERNOR
Unfortunate Syrian Claims to Have

Plotters.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 23.â Governor
Nassh to-day pardoned Abraham Dah
rouge, a Syrian who was sent to prison
from Cincinnati in 1S99 for having sold
a rented typewriter.
Dahrouge tells a strange story in his
statement to the Governor. He says he
was sent to Cincinnati in 1838 by All Far-
DUgh Bey, Turkish Minister at Washing
:on, to investigate a society of his
countrymen which he asserts was organ
ized to conspire against the Turkish Gov
?rnment.
According to his story he took a traitor
unwittingly into his employ, and this
man, who also was a Syrian and a mem
be- of the society Dahrouge was sent to
investigate, secured access to secret cor
respondence between Dahrouge and Min
ister AH Farough Bey. This pretended
-riend betrayed Dahrouge to the other
members of the conspiracy and DahrouÂ»e
asserts that a plot to ruin him was
formed.

GOOD ACTING MAKES INFERIOR PLAY
ACCEPTABLE TO COLUMBIA AUDIENCE
Mary Mannering and Clever Support Appear in "Janice
Meredith" â The Alcazar Gives Splendid Production of
w< Charley's Aunt"â Minnie Seligman Portrays Carmen
ONE did not hope for much from
"Janice Meredith" as a play, but
as it was found last night at
the Columbia Theater even Jess- .
was received than one had ex
pectedâthat is, so far as the play goes.
The people are another story. Something,
however, sufficed to fill the" theater in 'a j
fashion'most agreeable to the managerial
heart â the remembered charm of ' Mary
Mannering mayhap, with the' later, inex
plicable vogue of the book itself. The
dramatization is the work of Paul Leices
ter Ford, the author, and Edward Rose,
and may be described in brief as a. noble
attempt to leave nothing of the book oi^t
in the course of its four acts, with curious
results. With a determined effort to saeri â
fice no incident of importance in the book,
the playwrights have piled climax upon
climax without the least elementary re
gard for the laws of composition. The
situations crowd one another to suffoca
tion, linked by the merest thread of con
nection, and following one another with
out reason or sequence. It is wantonly
implausible, disjointed, noisy and yet with
the making of a good play about it had
the pruning been done intelligently.
I The second act is ihe best and shows
. some rather taking comedy and stirring
incident, with breathing space to enjoy
it, but the third and fourth acts are
; simply turgid melodrama and the gatling
\ gun festival at the Orpheum is tame in
comparison so far as noise goes. Still, it
, was rather well enjoyed by the audience
I on the whole, thanks to Its riotous pa
j triotism and to the clever folk who are
j wasting their. time on it.
1 Mary Mannering is the beautiful Janice
| and with good looks sufficient to prevent
| the wholesale devastation wrought by
that revolutionary Helen from becoming
ridiculous. It does border a little on the
absurd as one stalwart warrior after an
other goes down under the bright eyes of
the lady, but Miss Mannering is quite
charming enough to carry off the situa
tion. The pretty actress has strengthened
considerably in her art since she was last
here with Hackett in "The Prisoner or
Zenda," though she has hardly the im
perious personality that distinguishes a
star from the less magnetic members of
the company.
She acts with grace and discretion, with
finish and conscience, though without any
profound conviction or depth. She looks
the part admirably and quite fulfills any
ideal one may have formed of the young
enchantress. But Miss Mannering can
not be judged fairly, from her work In the
play. That she makes so much of the
part argues a good deal for her powers,
a:3d her efforts will go far to carry the
play into an undeseved popularity.
Miss Mannering is excellently support
ed. Amy Ricard, as her bosom friend
Tabitha, is a charming ingenue, graceful,
winsome, pert and everything that
labitha was in just the right
way. Miss Ricard shows strong
aptitude for her work. Robert
Drouet has the part of the lover of the
iair Janice, a somewhat subordinate role
m i.ie play, though more prominent than
In the book. Mr. Drouet is fairly success
ful in his impersonation. H. S. Northrup
and Charles Cherry are excellently cast
as Lord Clowes and Lieutenant Mow
bray and do all that is required for the
parts in a polished fasbion. Both are in
telligent and graceful actors Carl
Ahrendt is a successful Hessian colonel
as Rahl. and Squire Meredith is well por
trayed by W. D. Chaflin. Miss E A
.h,bene Is a melodramatic Mrs. Meredith
and the rest of the cast is capable
throughout. It is a good company wasted
on a poor play.
Alcazar.
! At the Alcazar last night was produced
Belasco & Thall's Christmas offering
"Charley's Aunt," the brilliant farce
comedy by Brandon Thomas. It was
greeted by a crowded house. It is four
years: since the farce was last played
here, and the merriment that greeted its
new and elaborate presentation augurs
well for a big week at the popular house.
Not Â«ven under the Charles Frohman
management has Thomas' play received
better or more accomplished treatment
at the hands of actor and actress. FirsL
of all it may be said that Belasco & Thall

FRUIT GROWERS OBJECT
TO EXCESSIVE CHARGES
The transportation committee of the
late State Fruit Growers' Convention
which was held* in San Francisco during
the early days of this month, through R.
u. Stephens, chairman of the committee,
has addressed a communication to all the
railroad companies engaged in the trans
portation of T'ruit from this State, asking
some modification in the present condi
tions relating to refrigeration charges.
The principal objection is made to the
monopoly enjoyed by certain companies
engaged in this business, the committee
saying:
AV'e believe the Â»riv te ownership and con
fÂ°.., of refricera tor cars used for shipment of
California fruit to be inimical to the interests
of growers and shippers, as affording an op
portunity for discrimination and favoritism.
All cars and other transportation facilities
should be owned and controlled in- every par
ticular by the railroads, and all shippers
should have equal facilities and upon equal
terms.
We, therefore, in this public way, record our
earnest protest a?alnst the renewal or exten
sion of existing contracts with the refrigera
tor lines now engaged in this traffic, or the
making of any similar contracts with any
parties whatsoever.
A\e make further objection to tha private
ownership and control of these refrigerator
cars, as havlns the effect to maintain what we
consider excessive refrigeration rates.
There is no power that can prevent such
combination so lortg; as private cars have the
monopoly of carrying fruit, with a tariff that
brings in such an enormous profit as does the
present tariff for refrigeration, for the reason
that the larte fruit companies are corpora
tions, and there is no lav/ through which the
transfer and control of the stock of such cor
porations can be prevented.
The report also says that "nothing can
be done that will better promote the In
terests of the people of California than
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1901.
CLEVER PERFORMERS AT
THE ORPHEUM AND TIVOLI
OPERA-HOUSE.
t
it is worthy of the highest praise. The
setting of the second act, the exterior of
a college, was aptly described by Ela
Delahay, played by the dainty Oza Wal
drop, as "the scholars' paradise." The
new wood border, admirably painted, was
a feature of the set. Now, to the Alca
zar stock company: Rarely has this cap
able dramatic organization been seen to
such admirable advantage as in "Char
ley's Aunt." Alsop as Jack Chesney was
excellent", Gerson's Sir Francis Chesney
was very good, Shumer's Charley W-ykem
was sprightly, Howard Scott's Spettlgue
adequately eccentric, Frank Bacon's
Lord Babberly screamingly droll. Royal
Dana Tracy's idea of Brasset was perfect
ly in keeping with the Idea of the charac
ter. Of the ladies Margaret Wycherley
and Marion Convere, Amy Spettigue and
Kitty Verdun, respectively, might have
stepped out of a spring fashion plate, so
dainty did they look, while Marie Howe,
sedate and handsomely gowned, gave an
admirable performance of Donna Lucia
D'Alvadcrez. "Charley's Aunt" is a mer
ry play for the merry season. The vo
ciferous applause last night and the unre
strained laughter and curtain calls were
compliments justly won by actor and
management.
Orpheum.
The Orpheum Road Show has caught on,
and the house was crowded to the doors
last night. Joe Welch, the German Jew
monologist, is the bright particular star,
and while he is on the stage the laughter
is incessant. It is not so much what he
says as the way he says It that involun
tarily causes laughter, and his walk and
appearance help greatly also to that end.
He is unquestionably the prince of mono
logists. W. C. Fields, the eccentric, is
very clever, and his tricks are mostly
funny as well as clever. Elizabeth Mur
ray has established herself as a prime fa
vorite with her coon songs and funny
stories. The drill of the Union Gatling
Guards has to be seen to be appreciated.

Frank Raymond was held by Judgo
Conlan on a charge of attempt to commit
burglary in $1009 bonds. Raymond, it is
aliGccd, tried to break into the house of

Tribune's Christmas Edition.
The holiday edition of the Oakland
Tribune, issued on Saturday last, is full
of interesting features. Stories by Bret
Harte, Cyrus Townsend Brady and clever
members of the local staff fill the supple

by leading citizens of the Anthenian City
are also of high order. The edition con

California.
The "Devil's Auction" was presented
for the second time at the California
Theater last night with the usual stage
effects. One of the best things in the
show Is the work of Fox and Foxie, the
trained terrier and Its master. This piece
continues at the California for the rest
of the week.
Grand Opera-House.
Minnie Seligman's rendition of Carmen,
at the Grand Opera-house last night
brought her round after round of hearty
applause, and on several occasions she
was called before the curtain. Miss Ser
ligman renders Carmen in a manner that
meets the ideas of the ordinary reader of
Prosper Merimeee's book. She is a-3
coarse as the book Carmen is coarse, and
shows Carmen as Merimee intended she
should be shownâ a woman full of passion,
who would allow nothing to stand in the
way of the accomplishment of anything
her fickle mind prompted. She gets all
out of the part that a clever actress can
get out of it, and does it in such a man
ner that she is bound to please. She is
not ably supported. The Don Jose of Her
schel MayaH is not of 'the best, and the
other members of the troupe are but lit
tle better. To the leading lady alone Is
due the success of this latest production
of "Carmen" In San Francisco.
Central.
A large audience was present at the
Central Theater last night to witness the
initial performance of the thrilling melo
drama of English country life, entitled
"The Silver King." The play is a good
one and well rendered by the Central
company. It should prove one of the
leading holiday attractions. Hallet
Thompson, the hero, is the prime favorite
with the audience and has never appeared
to better advantage than in this produc
tion. Stanley Ross, the villain, makes his
part so realistic that he is greeted with a
storm of hisses at .every appearance in
the later acts. Annette Marshall as the
leading lady is eminently successful.
Ernest Howell; Willard Blackmore and
James Corrigan, well known to Central
patrons, are up to their usual standard
and receive frequent applause. The minor
parts are well rendered, and the play as
a whole is admirably balanced. The action
is rapid and the plot clearly distinguish
able. Interest is never allowed to flag,
even for an instant, and "The Silver
King" will undoubtedly prove a brilliant
success.
Fischer's Concert-House.
Coleman and Mexis put up a wonderful
exhibition of sharpshooting at Fischer's
Concert-house last -night, and . a large
audience applauded their efforts. Seem
ingly impossible feats are performed by
these people, and their shooting" must be
seen to be appreciated. Eleanora Jenkins,
the favorite soprano, sang "A Monkey on
a Stick," from "The Geisha," and re
sponded to a big encore with the moon
song from the "Mikado." The Paloma
Ladies' Quartet had new songs to offer,
and Elizabeth Nella, a whistler, new to
San Francisco, trilled and double-tongued
many popular melodies. Lainar and Hall,
comedy sketch artists, and Otto T. John
sone, a card manipulator and magician,
presented many new tricks. The Sorensen
children will appear to-night, and a spe
cial matinee will be given on Christmas
day.
Chutes.
A large audience enjoyed the new bill
at the Chutes last night. Deaves' Merry
Manikins, "Italian Marionettes," scored
a big hit and kept the audience in a con
tinual roar of laughter, it being one of
the most interesting acts seen here for
some time. Goleman's cats and dogs re
peated their big success of the Orpheum
a short time ago., Dave Lloyd, monolo
gist. told some new stories and sang paro
dies on popular songs. Other good num
bers are Bicknell, the clay .modeler; Alma
Wutrich in new songs, and a series of
new moving pictures. A beautifully deco
rated Christmas tree Is also shown at the
conclusion of the performance.
STEAL HORSE AND WAGON
TO GET HOLLY BRANCHES
Charles Smith arid Albert Alrow were
arrested at an early hour yesterday morn
ing by. Sergeant Ellis and Policemen Al
varez and Conway and booked at the City
Prison on charges of grand larceny and
petty larceny. They appeared before
Judge Mogan yesterday and after being
Instructed and arraigned the cases were
continued until December 26.
About 3 o'clock in the morning the men
jumped into a newspaper delivery wagon
and drove to the residence of W. C. Tal
bot, 1730 Jackson street. They tore the
branches off a holly tree in the garden
and carried them to the wagon.
Policeman Alvarez heard the noise made
by the thieves and whistled for assistance.
Sergeant Ellis and Policeman Conway
answered the call, and they searched the
garden and found the two defendants hid
ing under a tree. They were- charged with
grand larceny for stealing the horse and
wagon and petty larceny for stealing the
branches off the holly tree.

British Attacked in Or
ange River and Trans
vaal Colonies.
In a Series of Fierce Engage
ments the Casualties Ag
gregate 150.
LONDON,' Dec. 23.â Lord Kitchener, in a
dispatch from Johannesburg, dated Satur
day k December 21, sends -reports of sharp
fighting in the Orange River and Trans
vaal colonies. .The engagements occurred,
December 18, 19 and 20 at points widely
apart. The casualties, so far as known,
aggregate about 150, equally divided; but
heavy British losses, the totals of which
have not yet been reported, have occurred
in the Transvaal. In this last mentioned
fighting- two hundred mounted Infantry In
the neighborhod of Beginderyn were di
vided into parties and were searching
farms when they were' attacked by 300
Boers and forty armed natives under
Commandant Britz. The Boers charged
determinedly in overwhelming numbers.
Beyond the fact that the British casualties
were severe, no details have been received.
General Dewet's Attack.
Lord Kitchener also reports that during
General Dewet's attack on the force com
manded by Generals Dartnell and Camp
bell at Langberg, December 18, the Boers
charged bravely and fought desperately
for several hours. Dewet was driven off
with the loss of twenty men. There w^re
twelve casualties on the Bide of the
British.
In the eastern part of the Transvaal col
ony Colonel MacKenzio attacked Com
mandant Smith's force of Boers at Lake
Banagher December 20, killine six and
capturing sixteen of them. Commandant
Smith escaped. _^
A force oÂ£ Boers during the night of De
cember 19 attacked the British post at
Eland Spruit, but they were driven off,
leaving eight men killed, including Com
mandant Kriz. Field Cornet Mahon, who
was wounded, and three other wounded
men were also left on the field. Other
wounded Boers were carried off in blan
kets. The British casualties were seven
men killed and six officers and eighteen
men wounded.
Boers Surprise the British.
On December 20 M. Botha, with 500
Boers, surprised Colonel Dammant's ad
vance guard at Tafelkop, Orange River
Colony. The Boers rushed a kopje com
manding the main body and the guns, but
Dammant rallied his men and drove the
Boers from the kopje. The British casual
ties were heavy. Dammant was danger
ously wounded, two officers and twenty
men killed and three officers and seven
teen men were wounded. The Boers left
six dead on the field and dispersed. The
British pursued the enemy and captured
a number of prisoners. Including Com
mandant Keyter.
In the fight at Tafel Kop the Boers,
dressed as British Yeomen, engaged in a
splendid race with the British in an at
tempt to first gain the crest of the kopje.
The Boers gained the summit first and
opened a heavy fire on the single troop of
Dammant's Horse, which took part in the
race for the kopje. These troopers took
advantage of a little cover available im
mediately below the Boers and fought un
til all but four of them were killed or
â¢wounded. By that time reinforcements of
Dammant's Horse came up and charged
and captured the kopje.
PYTHIAN KNIGHTS MEET
THE SUPREME CHANTDEIXOR
Head of Order Says More Than
Seventy Thousand Strangers Will
Congregate Here.
One of the largest r gatherings- of
Knights of Pythias of this city assembled
last night in Crystal Hall of the Pythian
Castle to tender a reception to Ogden H.
Fethers, supreme chancellor of the order.
He w&.s greeted with rousing cheers when
he entered the hall. He was formally In
troduced by Herman Schaffner, grand
keeper of records and seal for the grand
domain of California, who was the cnalr
man of the evening in the absence of
Grand Chancellor L. S. Calkins, who was
unavoidably detained in the southern part
of the State.
The supreme chancellor delivered an
address. After reviewing the condition
of the order at this time ne spoke of the
Supreme Convention that is to be held in
this city during the week commencing on
the 12th of next August. He said that the
people in the East are very anxious to
come to a State where there is delightful
weather as contrasted with the EaStâpeo
ple who want to become acquainted with
the resources of the State and to obtain
personal knowledge of what to them
seems to be a second paradise. Â»
"1 can assure you," said he, "that
there will be not less than seventy thou
sand strangers in San Francisco during
Pythian week. There will be not less
than fourteen thousand members of the
Uniform Rank of the order, who will hold
â tneir encampment here at the same time
that the Supreme Lodge shall be in ses
sion.
"These alone will make the grandest
show on parade that any fraternal order
ever made in this city. They will come
from the country east of the Rocky
Mountains, and to this number must be
added those who will come" from Oregon,
Washington, far off Alaska and Hawaii."
' He then reviewed the work that has
already been done for the convention and
said that he felt that it will be a great
success.
He was followed In short addresses by
Supreme Representatives W. C. Graves
and George Samuels and W. H. Bodflsh
the senior past grand chancellor.
Monticello Club Celebration.
The directors of the Monticello Club are
arranging for a grand celebration of
Jackson day on January 8, 1902. A spe
cial programme has been prepared under
the supervision of the. president, James
P. Booth, and everything is being done
to make the affair a brilliant success. The
clubrooms have been prettily decorated
wtih wreaths and garlands to add to the
attractiveness of their already homelike
appearance. The members will keep an
open house and receive their friends on
Christmas and New Year.
WOMAN rNTCTRED IN .COLLISION,
Mrs. ; Saul Saunders Suffers in an
Accident.
Mrs. Saul Saunders, who resides at the
northwest corner of Bush and Fillmore
streets , was injured last night In a colli
sion between a car of the Fillmo're-street
line and one of the California-street line.
Defective brakes and slippery rails are
said to be the cause of the accident. Mrs.
Saunders was badly cut on the head and
face and was taken to a neighboring drug
store for treatment.- , She was removed
later to her home.
Car and Wagon Collide.
Shortly after 7 o'clock last night an
east-bound Union-street car collided with
an express wagon at the corner of Union
and Hyde streets. The front part of the
car was demolished and the express
wagon was completely wrecked. 1 The

MACLAY REFUSES
TO RESIGN PLACE
Schley's Traducer Makes
a Demand for a
Trial.
Declares the President Cannot
Dismiss ' Him Under
Civil Service Law.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â Edgar Stanton
Maclay, whose connection with the Schley
case led President Roosevelt to request
his resignation as special laborer in the
navy, made formal demand to-day for
trial by usual naval procedure, .tie
averred that his case came under the
civil service law and that he could not
be dismissed without formal charges, trial
and conviction. The request for his resig
nation was sent to him by Rear Admiral
Barker, commander of the navy yard at
Brooklyn, and he replied at once by let
ter, formally setting forth his position.
Discussing the case Maclay said:
The President cannot have me dismissed
under the law as I see it. I do not see now
he can force me out. I am protected by the
civil service laws enacted by Congress, whose
enactments the President Is bound to execute.
I do not know positively, but I believe my po
sition under the civil service furnishes me
complete protection bo long aa I violate no
rules of the service, and that I have not done
and I have so stated In my letter to the com
mandant In answer to the request for my
resignation. No, I did not say that the Presi
dent is as bad as the Czar of Russia.
I have done nothing more than write to the
commandant and ask that charges be pre
ferred against me, and will do nothing more
Just now. 1 have not been suspended, and
am working here to-day as I have been doing
for fifteen months. I have tried to do my.
duty here and have broken no rules and I shall
simply stand by my rights, more for the
principle of the matter than anything else, for
my position here pays me very . little and Is
chiefly valuable because of the experience and
Information It affords me as material for my
books.
Rear Admiral Barker forwarded Mac
lay's letter to Washington.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. â Secretary
Liong said to-night that he had not re
ceived the reply of Maclay to tho request
tor his resignation. Pending its receipt
the Secretary said he did not wish to en
ter into a discussion of the matter for
publication. In his Informal discussion
of the matter to-day Secretary Long
made It perfectly plain that the Presl
dent's intentions in regard to Maclay
would be carried out regardless of the lat
ter' s declaration that he is protected by
civil service rules. It is expected that if
he does not resign he will be removed
summarily.
MUST TAKE HIS MEDICINE
If Miles Replies to Rebuke He May
Go on Retired list.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â Lieutenant
General Nelson A. Miles will be given no
opportunity to clear his record of the
stain placed upon it by the sharp rebuke
administered to him. by the President and
Secretary of War.
There is no disposition on the part of
the administration to give General Miles
a chance to keep the Schley controversy
alive. If General Miles should apply for
a court of Inquiry and it should be grant
ed the investigation -would keep the
Schley case in public mind. For General
Miles to make such an application would
be to question the right and justice of
the action of his superior officers.
Army officials say that General Miles
was called upon for an explanation, and
that he admitted the authenticity of the
interview, but the reason for Its giving
was not considered satisfactory. He had
every opportunity to clear himself, but
he was unable to do so, and then the re->
buke was administered.
Rumors reached the War Department
to-day that General Miles had again
talked for publication. These aroused the
greatest interest, but in the absence of
the Secretary in New York, nothing was
done to establish their correctness. This
much was stated emphatically: in- the
present temper of the President and Sec
retary Root, if General Miles again com
ments indiscreetly upon the Schley case
or upon the action taken by the Presi
dent and Secretary of War, he will be
subjected to even a harsher proceeding
than that he has already suffered.
General Miles' friends urge that the law
prohibits the infliction of punishment
upon an officer without trial by a court
martial, and they claim that the action
taken was severe punishment. The War
Department evades this contention by the
statement that the communication ad
dressed to General Miles was not a rep
rimand, but a rebuke, and the President
and the department have a right to tell
an officer when he has done wrong. Of
ficials of the Department do not threaten
General Miles, but they point to the fact
that" he is now over 62 years of age, and
there is a law which gives the President
discretionary- authority to retire an of
ficer when he reaches that age. The
President does not desire to proceed to
extreme measures in General Miles' case,
but in his own interest the officials say
it would be advisable for the command-
Ing general to swallow his medicine, bit
ter though It tastes.'
Benevolent Society Appeals.
The managers of the General German
Ladies' Benevolent Society announce that
on Friday evening, December 27, their
annual festival will take place in Golden
Gate Hall. As in former years at Christ
mas time, the society appeals to its
friends for the means to make the festival
a bright event for the poor.

MAN TO SUCCEED
GAGE NOT FOUND
Former Governor Shaw
of Iowa May Get the
Cabinet Place.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.-A tender of
the office of Secretary of the Treasury to
succeed Secretary Gage has been made
to former Governor Leslie M. Shaw of
Iowa, but it Is understood that up to a.
late hour to-night no response had been
received from Governor Shaw to the in
quiries sent him. At the White House no
information on the subject Is obtainable,
pending a definite authorization of the
fact that a successor to~ Secretary Gage
has teen found. ,
DES MOINES, Iowa, â¢ Dec. 23.â Former
Governor Shaw left for the East to-night.
Seen as the train pulled out,' he said: *"I
have seen the newspaper dispatches which
state that I have been selected by Presi
dent Roosevelt to succeed Secretary Gage
as Secretary of the Treasury in the Presi
dent's Cabinet. I have no other informa
tion on the subject. Manifestly I cannot
discuss iL I have not received any Infor
mation on the subject from Washington,
either from President Roosevelt or from
any Iowa friends there."
The former Governor declined to state
his purpose in leaving the city for the
East, and he said he had not been called
to Washington. It is generally understood
here that Governor Shaw has been de
termined upon for the treasury portfolio,
V'Ut the impression prevails that he will
T^obably not accept the position. While
he is well-to-do, he has not a large for
tune, and it is possible that he would
think himself unable, in a financial sense,
to accept tee place. At any rate, he could
not determine the matter before consulta
tion with some of his friends who are
high in the councils of the party in Iowa
and the nation.
CLEVELAND. Dec. 23.â Colonel Myron
T. Herrick returned to Cleveland from
Â£sew York to-day. Regarding the men
tion of his name as successor to Secre
tary of the Treasury Gage, he said he
had no offer of the position and all he
knew about going into the Cabinet was
what appeared in the press dispatches.
Colonel Herrick said that Judge Taft of
the Philippine Commission is on his way
to the Un:ted States and that on his ar
rival he (Taft) might be given a Cabinet
position, and that if such proved to be
the case no other Ohio man couldXÂ«xpect
a Cabinet portfolio.

Man's House.
SAN BERNARDINO, Dec. 23.â"Kanga
roo" justice was administered with telling
CSect to three tramps in the little town
cf Bagdad, on the desert, several days
ago. The tramps drifted into the place,
and, after hanging about the station for
k while, broke into the "shack" of Engi
feer Ebbott and ransacked his effects.
They took such articles as they could
carry away. Later the robbery was dis
covered and the thieves were captured.
There is no justice shop in Bagdad, and
it was decided to organize a "kangaroo"
court. George Porterfield was chosen as
judge. After the case had been argued
the court pronounced the trio guilty and
sentenced them "to be laid over a barrel
jind to be given ten lashes each with a
piece of rubber hose."
The sentence was executed with alacrity
and then the trio were taken to the bor
der of the town and told to/;lear out.
SAN JOSE. Dec. 23.â The California Cured

than one hundred carloads of last year's crop
and a verj* limited sup?]y of this year's pack
in the association's warehouses.

Revolution in Venezuela
Will Not Prevent
Collection.
Special Dispatch to The Call. '
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â No matter
what the Internal political condition of
Venezuela may be, Germany will carry
out her programme for the collection of
claims held by her subjects.
This is the expectation of the adminis
tration officials. Advices received by the
State Department show that the revolu
tionary movement is holding its own, and
President Castro will probably experience
difficulty in maintaining the control of the
government. The administration is hope
ful that Germany will consent to coliect
a small proportion of the 115,000,000 she
has demanded, and will make an arrange
ment with Venezuela for a settlement of
the remainder. It is out of the question,
the authorities say, for the Berlin Gov
ernment to expect to remain Indefinitely
in Venezuela, and a time payment must be
determined upon.
The Navy Department was advised to
day that, the battleship Indiana left
Curacao yesterday for Kingston. She will
arrive at her destination to-morrow and
will remain there unless the situation Jn
Venezuela demands her presence at La
Guayra, or becomes such that she can
join the North Atlantic squadron.
BERLIN, Dec. 23.â The Foreign Office,
â while it is reticent as to Germany's speci
fic plans with regard to Venezuela and the
time of their, execution, gives the impres
shm that something will be done soon.
It is watching the uprising in Venezuela
under the leadership of General Mendoza.
If anything serious should come of this
revolutionary movement Germany will
suspend action in the matter until it shall
have been seen with what party the de
facto Government rests.
The Berlin newspapers continue to pub
lish everything available on this subject.
The Berliner Tageblatt sums up Ger
many's position in the Venezuelan matter
in the following words:
"This new rebellion is of the most con
sequence to our relations with that coun
try. Our position toward the Government
of Venezuela would naturally be influ
enced if everything there goes to topsy
turvy." Â«

GENEBAIi MTLES IN PUBLIC
Host Remarkable Scene at the Ex
ecutive Mansion Said to Have
Had Many Witnesses.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â A Washington
special to the Press says: To those who
were witnesses of a remarkable scene in
the executive mansion Saturday and to
a few who have been taken into the con
fidence of those who beheld it, the ofllcial
reprimand of General Miles by the Sec
retary of War is dwarfed by the unofficial
reproof and reproach which he received
Saturday afternoon from President
Roosevelt In the presence of a score of
the most representative and influential
public men and private citizens in the
United States. A few minutes after the
arrival of Miles, the door from the execu
tive's pri% - ate room opened and the Presi
dent hurriedly came in. Glancing hastily
around him and catching sight of Miles,
the President walked up to him rapidly
with evidences of excitement in his whole
demeanor. Placing himself squarely be
fore the aged and white haired lieutenant
general of the army he waved his arms
energetically and then raised his finger
warningly under the nose of Miles.
"I will have you know," said the Presi
dent in a loud voice, "I will not allow
you to criticize executive and department
al acts. I don't care who you are, I will
not stand it, and you will find out that
I am going to stop this sort of thing."
The distinguished witnesses of this vig
orous reprimand before other persons
were further astounded by what followed.
The President had grown flushed, and
was visibly restraining himself from a
violent outburst of wrath only by an ex
treme effort. Then he turned upon Mile's
again. Uplifting his arm, he shook it
almost furiously in the general's face.
"I'll show you," he said, and turned his
back upon him.
The Press further says that Miles and
Dewey are -both in disgrace with the ad
ministration and that neither will repre
sent the United States at the coronation
of King Edward.

A WORLD POWER
Justice Brewer Reviews
the New Conditions
in America.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 23.-The twenty
first annual banquet of the New England
Society of Pennsylvania was held to
"night in Horticultural Hall, covers being
laid for nearly 400 members and guests.
Guests -were present from New York,
Baltimore, Washington, Boston and other
cities. Assistant United States Attorney
General James M. Beck, president of the
society, opened the speechmaking with a
brief address. In Coming down the line
of illustrious New Englanders, President
Beck mentioned the name of "George
Dewey." This was the signal for an out
burst of applause such as was not re
peated during the remainder of the even
ing. The principal speaker was Associate
Justice David Brewer of the United
States Supreme Court, who responded to
the toast, "The United States; A World
Power." Justice Brewer's address was
frequently punctuated with applause.
Among other things he said: â 
The twentieth century brings us face to face
with new conditions and we are conscious that
the United States of America has become a
more important factor in the world's thought.
Some fancy that the Spanish war wrought the
great change. This is hardly so. It may have
cleared the air and brought us face to face
with the consciousness of the change, but si
lent forces of commerce*"and religion have been
at work for years bringing about that result.
Again and again it Is stated that the United
States has now become a world-power.- So
it has. but what is meant by the term a
world-power, and how are we to Justify our
right to that title? Not by the manifestation
of military power or naval strength.
While wars will be as wars have been, and
while there Is within the resources of our coun
try an undlsplayed military and naval strength
that makes her the most dangerous enemy on
land and Eea, yet the dawn of the twentieth
century unveils a greater national glory than'
can be won on any field of strife. While the
events of the last two or three years have com
pelled an increase in our military and naval
force, while the amount of money which is
called for by the Secretaries of War and Navy
seem to many too large, and while the roll of
the drum and the blare of the bugle are more
often heard, yet the sons of the pilgrims will
,never turn our country over to the man on
horseback nor will our dearest laurels be crim
soned by the blood of the dying soldier.
We shall deserve to be caled a world-power
because our relations with all nations will be
carried upon the highest principles of truth
and Justice. We stand In the council of na
tions strong enough to - fear no attempt to
wrong us; so strong that we cannot afford to
wrong any, even the weakest nation; strong
enough to be firmly Just to the most powerful
of nations and so strong that we must be
kindly Just with the weakest. We must be
frank as well as honest. Henceforth diplo
matic language must be something to reveal
and not seeming to conceal thought and pur
pose. The honesty we must show Is not tho
honesty of Shylock, measured only by that
which Is enumerated in the bond, but that of
the golden rule, an honesty which compels us
to see the other party to the transaction.
Into all the avenues of our official life is en
tering civil service reform â promotion by
merit has ceased to be the Joke of the politi
cian and is coming to be the controlling rule
of all official life â not merely in the army and
navy (and we have had of late some very posi
tive assurance in respect to them), but in all
the departments of official life, national. Statn
and municipal. Whatever may be the present
defects In the machinery employed to secure
the desired result, and very likely the defects
are many. It Is one of the brightest assurances
of the future that the thought and- purpose of
the people are turned- In this direction and they
will not be thwarted.

was unearthed under the barn. Umilian
was convicted on strong circumstantial
evidence. A corncutter was used to cut
up the body. The motive was that Umi

ANARCHISTS MAY
BE EXTRADITED
Pan- Americarf Congress
Proposes Terms of a
New Treaty.
Contracting Parties Are to
Enact All Necessary
Legislation.
MEXICO CITY, Dec. 23.â At this morn
ing's session of the Pan-American Con
ference'Volney W. Foster, United States
delegate, proposed that Chicago be added
to the list cf cities liavlngr a. claim to a
branch of the proposed Pan-Ainerican
Bank. His motion was accepted by twelve
votes. Bolivia and Ecuador voted In the
negative and Chile abstained from voting,
but Walker Martinez, one of the Chilean
delegates, explained that this was because
his- country's delegates had abstalno'J
from voting on the main project, and not
from any lack of good will toward Chi
cago.
The project of a treaty for protection
against anarchy was read.
With slight modifications articles 10 and
11 of Senator Davis' Pan-American rail
way project were approved. These com
pleted the entire railway report, which is
therefore the second subject definitely dis
posed of by the conference, the first hav
ing been the Pan-American Bank;
The committee on extradition and sup
pression of anr.rchy presented its report
to-day. It recommends'that the American
republics sign a general treaty of extradi
tion. The proposed terms of such a treaty
are given, and they differ little from the
terms vi tho extradition treaty now in
foice between the United States and Mex
ico. The committee says that it expe
rienced difficulty in including, any special
provision against anarcy and anarchists,
owing on the one hand to the necessity of
respecting the liberty of belief, and on the
other to- the fact that the crimes of an
archists, such as the murder of President
McKinley, come under the ordinary clas
sifications of penal codes; and are suf
ficient to justify the extradition without
the need of special provisions. Neverthe
less, the committee says, it considers the
time ripe for some united action against
anarchy on the part of the nations of
America, and that It believes the best way
is to make the active* expression and
propagation of anarchistic ideas an ex
traditable offense. A provision to this ef
fect is included in the proposed treaty, as
follows:
Article 13â The contracting' parties agree to
provide in their respective legislation for the
punishment of the propagation of. anarchy.
The extradition of any Individual who may
have propagated anarchy may be In . demand
from the date on which said propagation be
corr.es punishable by the nation making the
request. In such cases it shall be granted, al
though the individual whose extradition is de
manded may be liable to a penalty of Im
prisonment of not less than two months.
BEYROUT EDICT
CAUSES A STIR
Tewfik Pasha Denies All
Knowledge of the Ex
pulsion Order. .
CONSTANTINOPLE, Sunday, Dec. 22.â
Replying to the protest of the United
States Charge d'Affaires here, Spencer
Eddy, against the notification issued by
the authorities of Beyrout. Syria, to the
effect that naturalized American citizens
must renounce their naturalization within
fifteen days, under penalty of being ex
pelled from Turkey, the Turkish Foreign
Minister, Tewflk Pasha, denied all konwl
edge of the matter, but promised to in
quire into it and give Eddy a definite re
ply on Monday.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â The State De
partment confirms the report that Mr.
Eddy, our Charge at Constantinople, is in
correspondence with the Porte relative to
the proposed expulsion of naturalized
American citizens from Turkey unless the
citizens abandon their allegiance to the
United States. Owing to the absence of a
naturalization treaty between the Unted
States and Turkey our Government has
no special authority to' interfere in behalf
of these naturalized citizens, as against
an edict of expulsion. The reliance upon
broad principles of international law is
not strong, for the principle' that a na
tion may refuse to allow its citizens to
change their nationality has been pretty
well established. But admitting the right
of expulsion, the United States Govern
ment has itself a right to insist that this
shall not be attended by hardship such
as might result from the allowance of a
very limited period of time for leaving
Turkey. It ls-^ossible that Eddy will take
advanced ground on that point if he can
not secure the abandonment of the pro
jected order of expulsion.

Duke of Newcastle, Brother-in-Law of the
Actress Who Was Once May Yohe v Visits
San Francisco on Way to the Southland
TITLED BROTHER-IN-LAW OF LADY FRANCIS HOPE, OR AS SHE IS
BETTER KNOWN, MAY YOHE. HE ARRIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO
YESTERDAY.
A DUKE mingled with the com
muters who crossed the bay to
Oakland on the 4:30 boat last
evening. He was the only one
on the vessel aware of this fact,
save his friend, Carleton Fox, arid conse
quently the plain American citizens who
were the Duke's traveling companions
missed an opportunity to take in the
points of a British peer of much celebrity.
Henry Pelham Archibald Douglas Pel
ham-Clinton, seventh Duke of Newcastle,
are the name and title of the nobleman.
He made a short inspection of the city
and lefffor Southern California on the
Owl last night.
The Duke of Newcastle is a confirmed
invalid. He is extremely lame and drags
himself along with great difficulty. In
the former centuries his ancestors were
rough old sailors, who worked their way
into the peerage by their valor in stub
born sea fights. The present Duke is a
pale, quiet man, who was born to live a
quiet life.
Little to Say of May Yohe.
Tho Duke was Interviewed on the Oak
land boat last evening by a number of
newspaper men, whom he treated gra
ciously, being ready to answer every
question that was propounded to him.
His brother, Lord Hope, married May
Yohe, and it was rumored that the Duke
was in. California to secure evidence to
enable his brother to free himself from
his matrimonial ties. This the Duke of
Newcastle denied. He said he was here
for his health, and his pale and worn ap
pearance bore out his statement. rHe
says that May Yohe never secured the
famous Hope gems which she has been
reported to have worn. The great collec
tion of jewels, with the exception of a
big blue diamond which was sold to a
New York millionaire, still remains Intact.
The Duke of Newcastle as a peer of the
realm is entitled to a seat in the House
of Lords. He remarked that Joseph.
Chamberlain was still Idolized by
the British public and that his policy In
reference to the Boer question had won
the approval of the majority in England.
Lord Rosebery. he said, was a Liberal,
who had come forward to save his party,
but he still urged that the war with the
JURY DECLARES
RATHBUN GUILTY
Indiana Murder Suspect
Is Convicted of
Manslaughter.
JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind., Dec. 23.â
Newell C. Rathbun, who was tried on tlie
charge of murdering Charles Goodman
by giving him poison, was found guilty of
manslaughter and his punishment fixed
at two to fourteen years in the peniten
tiary. The jury, which had been consid
ering the case since Saturday afternoon
at 3:15, reported at 10 o'clock to-night.
Rathbun's attorneys asked for a new trial
and the motion will be passed upon later.
Charles Goodwin, Rathbun's alleged vic
tim, was found dead last month in a hotel
in this city after he spent some time with
Rathbun. His body was shipped to Little
Rock, Ark., where 'Rathbun's wife lives,
as that of Rathbun, on whose life an in
surance policy for .$4000 had been issued.
Following the discovery: that the body
was not Rathbun's came Rathbun's ar
rest at Louisville, where he had, enlisted
under another name in the United States
army. The corpse was later identified as
that of Charles Goodman, a wanderer,
who came to Louisville from Evanston,
Ind., and met Rathbun iif- front of thu
Salvation Army headquarters here.

After the ferry-boat reached the Oak
land side the Duke, assisted by Mr. Cox,
walked slowly to the train that was to
convey them to Southern California.
There was no show, no long retinue of
servants. A rich peer whom nature had
not dealt kindly with was visiting Cali
fornia unostentatiously to secure advan
tage of the sunlight and flowers.
The Duke of Newcastle is a title that
sounds imposing and with it comes a
picture of a stalwart soldier, sword in
hand. But this impression is misleading.
The present Duke of Newcastle is a sad,
. pale-faced young man â one who looks
better fitted to be a cleric or a scholar
than the descendant of one of the old
sailors of England who swept the seas
and would rather sink his ship than sur
render. The present Duke is a high
ritualistic member of the Church of Eng
land. He believes in the doctrines that
were preached before the Reformation â
in fact, yesterday he said that he em
phaticall" denounced the present freedom
of securing of divorces. v

MONSTER'S FATE
IS DECAPITATION
Briere, the Murderer of
Five Young Children,
Is Convicted.
French Father Commits In
fanticide in Order to
Marry a Widow.
CHARTRE3, Dec. 23. â After a week"*
trial, which has attracted the attention
of the whole of France, Briere, the
farmer of this vicinity, who on April 21
murdered four of his daughters, aged 14,
11, 5 and 4 respectively and his son. 7 years
old, stabbing and beating them to death
while they were In bed, was found guilty
to-day and condemned to be decapitated
by the guillotine. Briere persisted in de
claring himself innocent, but the circum
stantial evidence against him was over
whelming. /
A pathetic Incident of the trial occurred
when Briere's surviving little daughter
(who the police declare only escaped the
fate of the other children by not respond
ing to Briere's invitation to go see him)
-went on the witness stand, sobbingly pro
testing that her father was innocent and
begging the court to restore him, to her.
Briere, at the "time of the murders, as
serted that two tramps entered his housa
during his absence and killed the chil
dren. He added that he returned while
the murderers were robbing the place and
that they attacked him and a-tter a des
perate struggle left him for dead with
four stabs in the head. He further al
leged that the tramps escaped with the
sum of 1600 francs and a number of ob
jects of value. Suspicion soon fell on
Briere. It was suggested, that he mur
dered his children in a lit of drunken mad
ness as he spent the evening of the mur
ders in dririKing and as no trace of tha
alleged tramps were found. Besides this,
Briere's wounds were only slight and the
knife with which they were intlicted was
found to belong to his house. Finally a
blood-stained jacket belonging to Briere
was discovered hidden under some straw id
,the courtyard. His arrest followed. An
other theory advanced in connection with â¢
the murders was that Briere wanted tc
marry a widow who had rejected him
on account of his large family and thai
he therefore sent for all his children,
some of them at that time boarding witfc
neighbors, and committed the murders,

VANDERBILTS GET
ASSETS OF BANK
Three Thousand Tacoma
Depositors- to Be
Paid at Once. '
Financial Circles Marvel at
the Generosity of the
Millionaires.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Dec. 23.â William K.. George
W, and Frederick \\\ Vanderbilt are made
owners of the assets of the failed Met
ropolitan Bank by the action of Judge
Snell of the Superior Court, who to-day
ordered Receiver Phelps to turn over the
property to Charles McXamee, represent
ing the Vanderbilts. McXamee submitted
to the court the certificate of Manager
Jackson of the London and San FranciBCO
Bank that half a million dollars was on
deposit in the bank to McNamee's credit
10 pay the claims of depositors. T.he
transfer will be completed to-morrow up
on the filing by McXamee of a bond in
the sum of $200,000.
Keceiver Phelps to-day made his first
report to the court in which he stated
that the bank's liabilities were $530,G00.
The face value of the assets was placed
at $471,000, but the receiver said they were
of comparatively small value, in that the
largest sum which it was possible to real
ize from them, even though long time be
allowed, would not even remotely approx
imate the amount of claims.
By an arrangement between Judge Snell,
McXamee and the receiver, the latter is
allowed $1300 for his services and his at
torneys JGOO.
McXamee will commence paying the de
positors not later than January 2. Three
thousand depositors who were made hap
py by the Vanderbilts' announcement on
Saturday that they would liquidate the
bank are doubling and trebling their
Christmas purchases. Bankers and other
business men declare the action of the
Vanderbilts in depositing half a million
dollars to save poor depositors from losses
incurred by a second and a third cousin
of the Vanderbilt family to be an instance
of generosity unparalleled in the history
of banking.

brush caught lire last night while being
used by the six-year-old daughter of li.
E. Laughlin at 14C North Fixth street, and
but for timely assistance the girl might
have lost her life and the house been
burned. The little girl was brushing her
hair in front of a bureau on which was :i
lamp, when the back of the brush caught
tire. It is remarkable that the girl's hair
was not ignited, as the brush was on h'Â»r
head when the flames were communicated
to it. Screams of the child brought Mrs.
Laughlin to the room. She seized the
brush and threw it out of the window.

WITNESS DEFIES
ALTURAS COURT
Refuses to Testify Jn
Trial of Alleged
â  Lyncher. '
The Entire Day Is Spent in
Argument by Judge and
Attorneys.
Special Disnatch to The Call.
ALTURAS, Dec. 23.â It is no reflection
on the court, but rather on certain of the
counsel, to say that the trial of James W.
Brown, the alleged Lookout lyncher, has
degenerated to a comedy of the monkey
and-parrot order. Practically the entira
| time to-day was spent in an argument as
I to whether a recalcitrant witness, should
I be made to answer questions. Clashes be
j tween the court and the attorneys for the
I defense were more frequent than usual,
] and time and again the lawyers were or
dered to take their seats. So accustomed
have they become to this procedure that
they to-day endeavored to adopt a time
saving policy by doing their talking while
seated. This greatly angered Judge Har
rington, and Raker was told that he
would save himself trouble by arising
| when he addressed the jury. Raker
â  obeyed instructions, but the first remark
that he made was one that the court re
garded as improper, and the lawyer waÂ»
ordered to sit down.
The case of Defendant Eades was to-day
set> for trial on January 13, and that of
Levanton on January 27. In fixing the
dates Judge . Harrington made some re
marks relative to separate trials before
juries. The defense objected to the court
making such statements, but Judge Har
rington instructed the court reporter and
clerk to ignore the objection.
A. L. Colburn, who testified before the
Grand Jury and since that time has been
kept here in Jail to prevent his leaving
the country, as he feared to be a witness
in this case, was called this morning. The
first question asked was if, about the 25th
of May, he had a conversation with Dep
| uty Constable Brown about a warrant to
;Â«search the Hall home. Before answering
he asked permission to make a statement,
and the jury was sent out of the room.
Colburn said that there was a conversa
tion about that time and of that nature.
| He declined to answer any further ques-
I tions, on the ground that his testimony
might tend to incriminate himself. Col
burn is one of the men whom Assistant
Attorney General Post seeks to have in
dicted for conspiracy as a result of his
refusal to testify against the other lynch
ers.
The court ordered the witness to answer
questions, and Colburn declined on the
ground that his testimony before the
Grand Jury had been, and was to be, used
against him by Post.
Sturtevant asked Colburn if Brown did
not tell him that the prisoners, meaning
Hall and the others, would be got rid of
within three days. Again he declined to
answer. When threatened with being sent
to jail he said that he had already been
in Jail six months and would just as soon
go back.
The status of Witness Colburn had not
been decided when the time for adjourn
ment arrived this afternoon. The entire
afternoon was spent in a three-cornered
argument between the prosecution, the
defense and the court as to whether Col
burn's refusal to testify constituted con
tempt.
SUICIDE'S BODY FOUND
IN SHALLOW RESERVOIH
Unfortunate Stranger in Redondo
Believed to Have Been F. H.
Norton of San Diego.
REDONDO, Dec. 23.â Face downwaid,
lying in the shallow water of an irrigating
reservoir, the body of a man, well dressed
and apparently about 55 years of age, was
found early to-day. It is supposed from
thfÂ» i-osition of'.the" body that the man
committed suicide, a's the water is not
deep in the reservoir and there are no In
dications of violence haying be?:i used.
It is surmised that the body is that of
F. H. Norton of San Diego, although full
identification has not yet been made. Nor
ton came to Redondo from San Diego
by steamship last Saturday and was seen
here. He was on his way to L05 An
geles, but it is said did not arrive there
as expected. Nothing is known here of F.
H. Norton, and no reason for his possible
Fiiic-ide is given. â
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 2T-F. H. Norton,
found drowned at Redondo, may be
George H. Coburn of Coronado. He left
home last Friday, leaving a note for hiH
wife, in which he said he was going away
and would never return. He is known to
have made inquiries about passage on a
steamer for northern points and has not
â Ince been heard of. lie was C3 years old.

STOCKTON, Dec. 23.â H. H. Kerrick,
master mechanic in the Southern Pacific
yards In Tracy, -was the victim of an un
usual accident yesterday. He was work
inr on the pilot of a locomotive as it was
being moved slowly out of the round
house. Suddenly there was a loud report
and he fell off the pilot. It was found
that a piece of metal flange had entered
his right leg just above the knee and
plowed its way upward for a distance of
four inches. It was so deeply imbedded
that it was found impossible to remove
it. During the day the pain increased.
A physician said an operation was neces
sary. Kerrick was accordingly put aboard
the Sacramento 'train this morning and
sent to the railroad hospital in Sacra

Some practical â¢ Joker is supposed to
have placed a railroad torpedo on the
track, and when struck by the pilot
wneels it was discharged. There is no

a fuse box set fixe to a train on the elec
tric overhead railway at Dingle station
to-day. Seven cf the railway employes
were killed. .
It appears that the burning train en
tered a tunnel stored with stacks of creo
soted railroad sleepers. These were also
set on fire and the tunnel became a blaz
ing furnace. The fire brigade had the
greatest difficulty in extinguishing the
flames.
Fortunately, the Dingle station la the
terminus of a railway running along the
docks, otherwise a terrible disaster would
have been recorded.
The accident occurred at 6 o'clock in
the evening. The train was packed, but
the majority of the passengers had
alighted at the previous station. Rumors
were spread that forty or fifty persons
had been killed and owing to the dense
volumes of smoke Issuing from the tun
nel it was some hours before an entrance
could be effected. Many passengers
jumped from the burning train and
rushed out of the tunnel, while others
were dragged out by their fellow travel
ers in a half suffocated condition.
Among the dead are the station fore
man, a signal boy and the driver and
guard of the train. The station buildings
were much damaged. Apparently no pas
sengers were killed, but it is possible that
other bodies may be recovered later

WALLA WALLA, Wash.. Dec. 21â All
that prevented fourteen prisoners break

SACRAMENTO. Dec. 23.â Congressman
Frank L. Coombs of Napa arrived in t*ls
city thia morning from Washington^;}
spend the holidays. Coombs said the Cal
ifornia delegation had been working as a
unit in the endeavor to bring about the
re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion
law, and expressed the opinion that a
great majority of the members of Con
gress were in favor of maintaining the
barrier against the Asiatic invasion.
Coombs said also that the Commerce
Committee of the House, of which he is
a member, would report a bill to be pre
sented on January 9. 1302, favoring tho
construction of the Nicaragua canal at a
maximum depth oS thirty-five feet, tha
details of construction and the procuring
of right of way to be left solely to the
President of the United States. Thl3 pro
posed bill is in conflict with Senator Mor
gan's measure, which provides for a com

St. Mary's Park and Tel
graph Hill Plans in
Bond Issue.
North End Merchants Want
Eminence Graded for
Traffic.
The Board of Supervisors passed to
print yesterday an ordinace declaring
that public interest demands the acquisi
tion of lands for the building of St.
Mary's square. The block proposed to be
i^uired is bounded by St. Mary's, Du-
Pt5 t, California and Pine streets. The
amount to be raised by bond issue is fixed
at $215,000. at which figure the Board of
"Works appraised the land required to be
purchased. McCarthy, Fontana and Staf
ford voted against the ordinance.
As a preliminary to the submission to
the electors at a bond election for public
improvements, the proposition to improve
Telegraph Hill, the City Engineer was di
rected to furnish before December SO, 1901.
an estimate of cost following out the plan
outlined in the recent report of the Board
of Works of the following projects:
First â For preserving and beautifying Tele
graph Hill.
Secondâ For preserving the hill and treating
it from a utilitarian standpoint by facilitat
ing; approach to the water front from the
business districts.
The property owners and business men
Â»n the neighborhood of Telegraph Hill
hied a petition stating that the increas
ing trade in commerce will require addi
tional space on the water front, and re
quests the necessary measures to secure
the grading of the hill in the vicinity of
the wharves. The petition says:
Want Telegraph Hill Graded Down.
That in view cf our rapidly increasing
trade with the Hawaiian and Philippine Isl
ands, which will requiie much additional
f; ace on the water front, we consider that
the interests of the commerce of this city and
Its future prosperity would be jeopardized Uy
U>7 action which your honorable board might
tnke to step the grading down of Telegraph
mil to some uniform grade, whereby the said
10 perty could then be utilized for the in
cT.ase of business facilities of the water
:ror.t cf Â£an Francisco.
That four new wharves are about to be
built between Lombard end Union streets and
six additional wharves between Kearny and
Lcrr.bard streets are soon to be built by the
Board of Harbor Commissioners, requiring the
use of additional space in the neighborhood
.or warehouses, etc.. and that work on a solid
pier. lOOtt feet long by 400 feet wide, is soon
to be started by the Harbor Commissioners at
the foot of Kearny street, for which work the
rock frcm the hill can be used to great ad-
Ya-r.tase.
The North Central Improvement Asso
ciation petitioned that the two proposi
tionsâone comprising the improvement of
the appearance and the preservation of
the hill, and the other the making of ad
ditional level streets at its baseâ be sepa
rated in the proposed call for a bond is
sue. The association says it has secured
expert testimony to the effect that the
hill is of no value as a windbreak for the
protection of shipping along the water
front.
Extension of Folsom Street.
The Board of Works was requested to
recommend the most feasible plan and
file an estimate of the cost to extend Fol
som street to Cortland avenue, in order
to afford direct communication between
Eernal Heights and the center of the city
The petition of the Bay View and Uni
versity Mound Improvement Club that th^
sum of $40,000 be included in the bond is
Â» Fue to put streets in the southeastern sec
p:ion of the city in good condition was re
ferred to the Finance Committee.
The Santa Fe Railway Company was
granted permission to alter grades on
streets in the Potrero on its filing an
agreement to maintain a footway on In
diana street. Captain A. H. Pason. vice
â¢president of the company, took occasion
to thank the board for the privileges
granted, which will result in great im
provement to the city.
The Richmond District Improvement As
sociation sent a communication to the
board commending it for condemning the
waters of Lobos Creek, and praising the
efforts of Supervisor D'Ancona, chairman
of the Health Committee, for his conduct
of the investigation.
An ordinance was referred to the Street
Committee ordering the repaving with
bitumen of Valencia street, between Mar
ket and Eighteenth, at a cost of $28,300.
An ordinance was amended to read that
the roadway cf no street shall be accept
ed unless it be paved with basalt blocks,
bituminous rock cr asphalt on a concrete
foundation, with paving brick on sand or
concrete foundation, or with cobblestones.
C. H. Hill Sued.

the vessel sprang a leak. This was on
October 1, and for nearly a month the
crew had to pump one hour in every four
in order to keep the vessel clear. Then
the leak was located and the rivets made
fast. In the meantime Captain Thoreux
had to take to his bed, thorouhgly worn
out. Since then he has been gradually
growing worse and Mate Ceuley brought
the ves-sel into port. As soon as the an
chor was down Captain Thoreux was re

Clamped Button to Her Finger.
Rose Brady, a young miss of 16, was
treated at the Harbor Hospital for a pe
culiar accident yesterday. She works \n
an overall factory' near the water front
and was engaged in putting buttons on
the garments. The work is done by ma
chinery, as the buttons, instead of being
sewed on, are clamped. Rose was talking
to one of her fellow workers and not pay
ing attention to her work. In consequence
her linger with a button in it got under
the machine and then came the catastro
phe. Miss Brady's finger was securely
buttoned and it took the doctor at the
hospital nearly half an hour to cut it out.
Outside of the nervous shock the young
lady is not seriously injured.

COLLINS QUITS
CASE IN ANGER
Resents Statement Made
by Maud Nevill, His
ClieniV/
She Intimates Her Attorney
Is Not . Sufficiently
Watchful. ' 7 I
The proceedings in the Cheyney main
tenance suit, which is being heard by
Judge Sloss, were brought to a temporary
close yesterday afternoon by an episode
tliat verged on the sensational. Maud
Nevill, by whom the suit was instituted,
intimated in open court that her attorney,
Gtorge D. xCollins, had been bdught by
Cheyney, the man she is suing for main
tenance. .'- Angered by the insinuations of
his client, Attorney Collins withdrew
from the case. Judge Sloss endeavored to
placate the irate counseli but his efforts
proved futile. The plaintiff being left
without an attorney, the case went over
until next Monday morning.
As soon as the court convened for the
afternoon session Attorney Collins arose
and addressed Judge Sloss, asking that
he be excused from further acting as Miss
Nfcvlll's attorney. In explanation of his
request he said that his client no longer
de&ired hi3 services; that she wanted At
torney Shortridge to act as her counsel.
It was in answer to her attorney's state
ment that the plaintiff made her startling
charge. She first declared that she did not
intend to dispense with Attorney Collins'
services, but that she desired to ha\Â£
Shortridge as an associate with Collins^
so that she might be better protected.
"That man Cheyney," she added, "would
purchase anybody." She said that At
torney Collins-had not given her sufficient
protection and that he had not offered
her any advice since the commencement
ot the trial. In making her insinuations
Miss Nevill was backed up by her mother.
The court finally consented to let Attor
ney Collins withdraw from the case and
the plaintiff was given until next Monday
to secure another attorney.
At the morning session Ira A. Smith,
proprietor of a Kearny-street lodging
house, testified that Cheyney had intro
duced Miss Nevill to Mrs. Smith as his
wife. Dr. George E. Bushnell testified
that he had been called in to treat Miss
Nevill, whom Cheyney introduced to him
as his wife.

SOUTH END CLUB
NEED NOT MOVE
Obstructions on Third
Street May Remain
Temporarily.
The resolution directing the removal
within sixty days of the obstructions on
city property at the foot of Third street
was amended by the Board of Supervis
ors yesterday to grant the South End
Rowing Club one and one-half years from
January 1, 1902, to remove its boathousea.
Attorney J. Lehrmann, representing the
South End Club, which would have been
directly affected by the terms of the res
olution, urged that the club be given time
to remove property on which $5000 had
been expended. He stated that it was in
tended to appeal to the Legislature for
the grant of sites in the bay for rowing
clubs, and that a former Board of Super
visors had granted the club the original
privilege. . , <- .
Reed made the motion that the obstruc
tions be allowed to remain for eighteen
months, which prompted Jennings to ask
under what . authority the privilege could
be granted. McCarthy suggested that the
boathouses be not disturbed until such
time as a wharf shall be built on the
property.
Attorney Wheeler, representing Payne
brothers and other prbtestants, agreed to
build a wharf if the obstructions were re
moved. Fontana's motion that the ob
structors be given six months to move
was not seconded. Comte pleaded that
consideration be shown the rowing club,
because it was occupying property not
immediately required by , the city, but
urged that all xjther trespassers be evict
ed. â¢'
The City Attorney was requested to in
form the board upon the following ques
tions arising in connection with the op
eration of the. proposed Geary-street mu
nicipal railroad system:
First â Over how many blocks may the city
operate a " municipal railroad on a street, on
which a franchise for a railroad now exists
or on which a railroad is being operated?
Second â Is the franchise granted November
6, 1878, to Messrs. Main, Norton, Bigelow, Me- 1
Cord, et al., a valid franchise, it being in ef
fect an extension of two blocks to the fran
chise granted to Messrs. Deane, Eppelsheimer,
Stanyan, Morrow, Porter and Crowell, April
13, 1877, for a railroad on Geary and other
streets.
Third â Is that portion of the Geary-street
franchise granted to use Point Lobos avenue
valid, said avenue at the time of the grant
being under the jurisdiction of the Park Com
missioners?
Fourth â If a portion of the franchise is in
valid does it invalidate the entire franchise?
The resolution granting the American
Can Company a permit to erect a bridge
across Seventh street, near Townsend,
was adopted. Chairman Curtis of the
Street Committee explained that the
committee- had reported against the reso
lution because it was held to be simply
the forerunner of a series of bridges
throughout the city. The Emporium
Company was denied a permit to erect a
bridge across Jessie street, between
Fourth and Fifth.
The department of electricity submitted
a plan for a private exchange telephone
system at the City Hall, and estimates
its cost at $5613 60.
The roadway of Page street, between
Central and Masonic avenues, was ac
cepted.
The Board of Works was authorized to
repave Bush street, between Sansome and
Battery..
David Hewes was denied a permit to
maintain a corrugated Iron structure on
the roof of his building at the corner of
Sixth and Market streets.
Policemen, like the hairs of a man's
head, are numbered.

SEEKS PAYMENT
OF OLD CLAIMS
Former Sewer Commis
sioners Ask for
Salaries.
The Board of Supervisors considered
yesterday the claims of Professor George
T. Davidson, Colonel George H. Mendell
and Irving M. Scott for $1500 each as
members of the old Sewer Commission.
The claimants desired payment under the
constitutional amendment out of the sur
plus fund.
Professor Davidson explained that the
members of the commission had tended
constantly to their duties for five moiiths
after their appointment by the Board of
Supervisors in 1892. The employes of the
commission were paid, but the Commis
sioners were not, and 250 miles of sewera
were investigated.
City Engineer Grunsky and Commis
sioner of Works Manson, who were con
sulting engineers on the Sewer Commis
sion, were subjected to a line of question
ing as to the services contributed by Mr.
Scott. They replied that the latter';*
knowledge of the needs of the city was of
value to the commission.
Supervisor Jennings stated that an in
vestigation had developed that Mr. Scott
had not attended many of the meetings
of the commission. Connor moved that
the claims be allowed, but McCarthy's
amended motion that the matter be re
ferred to the City Attorney to decide If
the board has the power to allow the pay
ment of the claims was carried.
The claim of C. S. Tilton. City Surveyor
in 1892, for $8500 for preparing a map of
the assessment district for a sewerage
system in Richmond was indefinitely post
poned. D. I. Mahoney, attorney for Til
ton, addressed the board in behalf of the
claim. It developed that the money was
paid by the city to Tilton's successor, W.
H. Fitzhugh, under a court decision.
The claim of John Hall for 5675 for ser
vices rendered the Street Committee in
connection with the Sixteenth-street ex
tension in 1892 was rejected.
A resolution was passed to print au
thorizing the payment of $3000 out of the
surplus fund to Dorn & Dorn in full dis
charge of a Judgment obtained against
the city for services rendered.
An ordinance was passed to print fixing
the wages of laborers in the park or on
public utilities that may hereafter be ac
quired by the city at $2 50 per diem.
The City Attorney was requested to fur
nish an opinion as to whether the execu
tors of the will of the late Adolph Sutro
and the Spring Valley Water Works can
legally agree to a modification of the
Dewey boulevard embodying a reduction
of width as suggested by the City Engi
neer and consent to an extension of two
years within which the boulevard may bo
completed by the city.
The petition of the Market-street Rail
way Company to erect a brick building
200 by 400 feet without Interior partitions
on the block of land bounded by Twenty
third. Twenty-fourth and Utah street3
and San Bruno avenue was referred to
the Fire Committee.
The ordinance granting the Chutes Com
pany permission to erect a bridge across
Tenth avenue, between C and Fulton
streets, was re-referred to the Street Com
mittee to give James Cavanagh and Wil
liam Kedpath. who protest against tha
privilege, an opportunity to be heard.

dition to this she had sent a force inland and burned
Managua as a lesson in government, she would have '
been amply justified.
As we have said before, there were found at that
time Americans who so little understood what the
Monroe doctrine means as to censure our own Gov
ernment for not declaring war against Great Britain
for teaching Nicaragua this needed lesson in civili
zation. So there are some of our countrymen who
censure President Roosevelt for not protecting Vene
zuela in her theft of the property of German sub
jects.
The petty tyrant who holds the Presidency of
Venezuela has been giving His version of the Mon-,
roe doctrine, and it i* intolerable and revolting to
any sense of justice. In his opinion it means that
the United States is *o protect Latin America in com
mitting any outrage, official murder, public theft and
spoliation of which Europeans are the victims. If
this were the meaning of our primacy of the hemi
sphere we would be in arms to defend a nest of
nations each one of which would resemble the Bul
garian brigands who kidnap women and hold them
for ransom. It is no exaggeration to say that if
President Castro's view is correct, in a short time the
semi-barbarous nations south of us would be captur
ing the Ministers of European countries and demand
ing ransoms of their Governments, sending in an
ear or a finger of the prisoner as a means of urging
haste. Surely there is but little difference between
this and flogging a foieign Consul on the bare back.
Let Venezuela and all who put her construction
(Ml the Monroe doctrine be warned that we approve
of thrashing them into civilization whenever they act
like savages. Not only do we approve of Germany
sending a fleet to collect $2,000,000 stolen from her
subjects by Castro's Government, but" we would take
satisfaction in seeing a German land force march to
Caracas rnd burn the capital over Castro's head.
Such punishment would be beneficial to his Govern- j
ment.
Iq these German cases the victims appealed to the
courts of Venezuela, but every judge who decided in
their favor was immediately deprived of his office
. by Castro, put in prison and another was appointed
in his place, with orders to find against the foreigners.
Americans were treated in the same way, and should
be righted by the same means that Germany is using.
The United States will permit no conquest of Vene
zuelan territory, but we permit and invite any nation
v hose people have been robbed by that Government
to go there and thrash it into a decent respect for
the rights and the property of others.
The New York python whose feat of swallowing
a crocodile was telegraphed all over the country a
short time ago has now distinguished himself again
by swallowing a horned lizard. It seems likely he is
working for a reputation that will get him a place as
a freak in a sideshow where he can have a chance
to swallow a bearded woman.
According to Justice Jerome there are upward of
130,000 persons engaged in the retail liquor business
in New York, but of course that includes only the
sellers. There is no calculating the number who
engage in it on the other side of the bar, but evi
dently there are enough to keep the liquor moving.
After all their condemnations of Russia for op
pressing Finland, of Great Britain for oppressing-
South Africa and the United States for taking, the

THE SOHLEY VERDICT.
PRELIMINARY comment has been, made all
over the country, which represented the first
impression produced by the' verdict rendered
against Schley by Admirals Benham and Ramsay.
The first opinions expressed might have been criti
cized as the result of impulse rather than of judg
ment. But now the sober second thought of the
country is being uttered and its condemnation of the
verdict has the weight of mature reflection: This
sober minded judgment so universally 1 condemns the
verdict as to frighten the men who procured and
rendered it into a quaking silence.
The American people will tolerate great big red
blooded mistakes. They will look kindly upon men
who . offend through a mighty and a manly passion.
They will walk backward and cover with a mantle
the naked errors of a great man fallen. ' But they will
not endure the meanness of small mert in big places.
The testimony was read and the verdict has been
read. From beginning to end it is a record green
with jealousy, red with petty revenge and sodden with
the sordid ambitions of small self-seekers. "Mean
ness" is written over it as often as the words "one
dollar" on the face of one of the old red dog shin
plaster bank notes.
The American people will have none of it.- The
pupil of a flea's eye is not small enough to hold their
estimate of the men who wrote it as their decision.
Nor are all the skies, en their blue concave above us/
big enough to write the American approval of Dewey
for his manly and generous judgment.
We do not believe that the Navy Department can
resist the consequences. It has adjudged and paid
to Sampson and the captain of his ship tens of thou
sands of dollars for the ships taken at Santiago,
though Sampson and Chadwick were below the hori
zon from the scene of that battle, and never saw its
smoke nor heard its guns. And Schley has been
paid as his share of the prize money the paltry sum
Â°f $3334 and his brave fleet captains even less!
It is too rank. The people want to lift the lid off
the department and see what makes the stench. They
want to quicklime the carcass of official spite and
petty meanness and put it out of mind, smell and
sight.
They are not building a navy to be manned by a
foul combination of avarice and meanness, nor main
taining a naval school to graduate heroes like Schley
to be humiliated by creatures like Benham and Ram
say and the envious officialdom of the department.
The majority verdict is set aside by the people. The
opinion of Dewey is their opinion, and they demand
that the parasite Maclay, officially employed at $2 43
a day to write naval history, be dismissed, his book
ordered out of Annapolis, and that the department
officials who indorsed it be punished by expulsion
from their offices. Let none of them imagine that
this is a passing breeze. It is a gale of popular de
mand and will blow until it besoms the combination
of mean spirited conspirators off the official roll and
into private life, where they can be exposed to
the well seasoned and permanent contempt of the
country.
A wealthy colored planter in Georgia invited a
number of prominent white people to dine with him.
They accepted the invitation, and while the host did
not sit at the table with his guests, but acted as di
rector of the waiters, there has been none the less
a whole lot of talk in Georgia about the incident,
and the conservatives are wondering how long it
will be before colored hosts will feel at liberty to sit
down with their guests.
THE REVENUE CUTTER SERVICE.
SENATE BILL 1025, which was introduced in
the Senate on December 5 by Senator Frye of
Maine, is a measure which not only com
mends itself to the general public as being eminently
just and proper, but it is of particular interest to the
commercial community of the Pacific Coast. The
object of the bill is to promote the efficiency of the
revenue cutter service by extending to its commis
sioned officers the benefits of the laws relating to the
retirement of officers of the army and navy who have
become incapacitated for active duty on account- of
age or physical disability incurred in line of duty.
The plea that the revenue cutter service is strictly
civil in character is an idle and specious one. It is
quite true that in time of peace the service is under
the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and
that while so placed it exercises certain civil func
tions; but the exercise of those functions under a
civil department of the Government no more makes
the officers of the cutter service civilians than does
the employment of army officers to arrest criminals
and fugitives from justice make of them policemen
or deputy marshals.
In the performance of its duties under the Treas
ury Department the cutter service is called upon to
enforce every law for the protection of the Govern
ment in maritime affairs, to assist vessels in distress,
and to afford every protection possible to legitimate
commerce. Its officers are required to undergo a
rigid system of instruction not only on subjects re
lating to navigation and seamanship, but arc com
pelled to pass examinations on gunnery, the hand
ling of men under arms, surveying and all other sub
jects of a military nature which form a part of a naval
officer's education. In addition thereto they are re
quired to have a thorough knowledge of constitu
tional, international and revenue law. Upon the
completion of their course of study they are required
to pass a very, rigid examination in all these
branches and are then commissioned by the Presi
dent in exactly the same way as are officers of the
army and navy.
In time of war the cutter service at once drops its
civil character and is transferred by existing law as
a body to the naval establishment, where it becomes
subject to the rules and regulations governing the
navy and is compelled to perform the same duties as
are required of naval officers and men. Since, then
these officers are compelled to perform duties which
necessitate exposure to the same risk of life in the
defense of their country as naval officers, it is hard
to conceive by what system of logic they can be de
nied equal privileges of retirement and promotion.
The cutter service has participated in every war in
which the United States has ever been engaged, and
its record of service for over a hundred years is one
of which its officers may be justly proud and are nat
urally anxious to maintain. Â£ At the present time,
however, the service is laboring under the lack of.
proper legislation. The higher grades are clogged
and promotion almost at a standstill by the presence
on the active list of a score or more of superannuated
officers whose lives -have been spent in the service
and who are now too old or- feeble to do duty. The*
junior officers are therefore called upon to perform
double duty without any extra compensation as a re
ward and do not even have the assurance of promo
tion as an incentive to urge them on.
I This condition of the service is disheartening to

those who are already in it and discouraging to the
youth of the country who might otherwise desire to
enter it as a life profession."
The commercial interests of the Pacific Coast, now
in process of rapid expansion in the new, fields which
have been opened to our merchant marine in the
Hawaiian Islands and the Philippines, demand the
same sort of protection as has been hitherto af
forded at home. It would doubtless prove a danger
ous and expensive experiment for the Government to
change the method <?f affording this protection and
guarding its own interests by adopting -a system dif
ferent from that which the experience of over a
century has proved to be a most successful one.
It is to be earnestly hoped nothing will interfere
to prevent the passage of the bill by the present
Congress. By its enactment a long-deferred act of
justice will be done a most .deserving -branch of our
public service and will enable it to extend its opera
tions to our new possessions.
A c'urious story comes from Chicago to the effect
that for the purpose of evading the school law which
prevents them from getting the use of the labor of
their children, some of the foreign born residents of
that city are getting the little ones married before
they are in their teens. An extreme case in which
a girl of 12 was married so as to exempt' her from
attendance at school has aroused the' authorities and
they are now trying to see what they can do about it.
UP to this time the holiday tradl. of the city has
been conducted under conditions that are well
nigh ideal. The purchasers have been liberal,
the merchants have displayed a store of Christmas
goods never before equaled, and the weather has
been everything that is lovely and delightful. There
is now a menace of rain, if that can be called a
menace which while spoiling the holiday charm of
the season would none the less be a benefit to the
State. Fortunately most of the Christmas shopping
is over and should rain come those who have to meet
it -while doing their shopping would have none but
themselves to blame for being too late.
Rain or shine, however, our California weather is.
never bad enough to interfere with any business in
which men and women are earnestly interested. At
worst it is never more than disagreeable. We have
no blizzards nor cold snaps that compel people to
stay at home through fear of freezing to death. WÂ£
tan do our shopping gayly and hold our Christmases
merrily in any kind of weather that ever occurs under
the genial skies of California.
The trade of the season is expected to break all
records. We have had a year of prosperity and we
are at peace among ourselves and with all the world.
From Washington come no reports of legislation
likely to injure or even disturb any industry of the
country, for it is now deemed certain at the capital
that all the dangerous so-called reciprocity treaties
that menaced some of our important domestic inter
ests will be defeated. Consequently we can look for
ward to a year of coming prosperity greater even
than that which we now enjoy. All conditions of the
time and all prospects of the future therefore com
bine to stimulate the Christmas feelings of liberality
and generosity. We can remember in our giving all
of our friends and the poor as well.
The one- thing to be done, then, is to go about
the shopping of these closing days of the season with
a genuine cheerfulness that nothing can disturb. The
motto of the shoppers should be: Don't' rush, don't
crush, there is room enough for all, time enough for
everybody and more Christmas goods than any one
can buv.
Governor Taft has an undoubted right to present
the work of the civil government in the Philippines
in an attractive light, but when he says "the military
disaster in Samar has created an unfounded feeling
of uneasiness concerning the condition of the people
of the rest of the archipelago" he is. going a little
too far. Something like the wholesale massacre of
an American troop by men who had shown every
evidence of friendliness is about as good a founda
tion as "uneasiness" could have.
STILL HARPING FOR SILVER.
CONGRESSMAN LITTLE of Arkansas has
introduced into the House of Representatives
a bill providing for the free coinage of sil
ver at the ratio of 16 to i. He is reported to have
declared that he has no idea that the bill will be
passed, but he hopes to be able to force a debate
upon it, "to keep the party record straight," and de
termine how many members of the House calling
themselves Democrats are really true to the Chicago
platform.
While Mr. Little is making that play at Washing
ton, Mr. Bryan is doing something of the same kind
in Nebraska* In the current number of the Com
moner he publishes a long editorial on "Bimetallism* 1
and in another column of the same issue he com
ments favorably upon the statement of a correspond
ent that Senator Jones of Nevada is wrong in hold
ing that "the increased output of gold has accom
plished what bimetallism would have accomplished."
Thus the former silver leader refuses to admit that
silver is dead. Like the Arkansas Congressman he
wishes to keep the party record straight, and so far
as the Commoner can do it the thing will be done.
Meantime there is trouble over the question else
where. The other clay Boss Croker of Tammany
was interviewed in New York concerning the politi
cal outlook of the party, and when asked about free
silver, he answered: "The silver question ought to
be dealt with by the National Committee. Let those
who framed it take cdre of it. We have nothing to
do with it."
In view of the fact that Bryan closed his campaign
in.1900 with the famous utterance, "Great is Tam
many and Croker is its prophet,"- the contemptuous
reference to those who framed the silver question for
the Democracy is rather unkind. It was perhaps a
shrewd move, however, to "pass the buck" to the
National Committee. It is now up to those gentle
men to soothe Bryan into keeping stilland seeing to
it that Mr. Little doesn't get a hearing for his silver
bill on the floor of the House. *
It is a grewsome story of home-seeking that comes
from Oklahoma to the effect that every road leading
from Guthrie.to the newly organized county was
lined on the opening day with prospective settlers,
many of them without money and without' food. It
was bitterly cold, numbers were severely frozen as
they waited on the roadside, and several perished. It
seems strange that persons in such condition should
have joined in the rush for lands, but a chance of
getting something for nothing tempts all classes.

THE CHRISTMAS -TRADE.
THIS AMERICAN GUN DISCHARGES
FIVE HUNDRED SHOTS A MINUTE
THIRD BATTERY, OF BROOKLYN, OF THE NEW YORK NATIONAL, GUARD HAS RECENTLY BEEN EQUIPPED
WITH RAPID-FIRE GUNS THAT EXPERTS PRONOUNCE TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF THEIR KIND
EVER INVENTED, OUTCLASSING THE GATLING GUN.
O' NE of the greatest and most instructive automatic
rapid fire guns in the world is now possessed by the
United States Government. It discharges 500 shots a
minute. The first military organization to be equipped
with these new field pieces is the Third Battery, New
York National Guard of Brooklyn. Twelve have just been is
eued to them.
The coat of the set, including carriage and tripod mount, was
$34,000. At the first battery test of the gun 250 shots were rired
In 32 1-5 seconds. Tho gun weighs forty pounds and is
mounted either on a steel tripod or a two-wheel carriage
when in action.
One of the legs of the tripod has a sort of a bicycle seat for
PHONOGRAPH FOX TRAP.
Elmer Skillings, a Maine fox trapper,
who became a wonder in that line so sud
denly that there has always been great
wonder at his success, has finally told the
secret by which he lured the sly foxes
into his traps.
Skillings, who Is a farmer in a sparsely
settled district, purchased a phonograph
and some records, for his own amusement
and to entertain his fellow farmers at tho
grange meetings. He has an ingenious
mind, which suggested an attempt to get
on record the noises of the poultry yard
that of the pullet which has just laid an
egg, the crowing of a cock, the quacking
of ducks and the discordant note of a
guinea fowl. He bought some blank rec
ords and secured all the novel results he
wanted.
Then another idea came to him. He ex
changed his instrument for a much finer
and larger one, and after a number of
trials obtained a fine record of the cluck
ing of a mother and the peeping of her
brood of chickens.
Then he went Into the woods, dug a
large hole, partially filling it with brush,
and arranged the phonograph in the hole,
so that by means of a long spring and a
self-returning mechanism of his own in
vention the record -would run continuous
ly for nearly a half-hour. A powerful
resonator made the sounds nearly as dis
tinct as the original. The apparatus was
completed with an alarm clock arrange
ment, so that the instrument could be set
in operation automatically at any hour
desired. The effect was startling, when
suddenly there would be heard, appar
ently from a heap of brushwood, the ex
cited clucking of a mother hen and the
answering peeps of her brood of chickens.
Skillings surrounded the place with fox
traps and set the machine to begin opera
tions several hours after sunset. It
â¢worked to perfection. : The first time it
was tried two foxes â were trapped. From
all appearances they were rushing in
upon the supposed defenseless brood, for
getting their usual cunning. The scheme
worked again and again until nearly all
the foxes In the vicinity had fallen vic
tims of Skillings' genius.
Work o* a Single Bullet.
One of the most remarkable shots ever
reported, was made by the late Dr. J. B.
Welch of Hudson, Mich.
Welch was hunting antelope in Monta
na, and was surprised one morning to see
a herd of animals appear upon a ridge
some 400 yards from camp. At the first
movement they scampered away. .Welch
ran to the top of the ridge and saw that
after going a short distance directly from
the camp the antelope had turned and
were running so that their broadside was
exposed. They were nearly a quarter of
a mile away, and Welch did not expect
to hit when he opened on them with his
high power rifle.
His astonishment may therefore be im
agined when on seeing one drop and -go
ing to the spot he found three dead ante
lope, each shot through the head. The
three had been running si.de by side and
one bullet had potted the trio.

"What sayeth he?" asked Abdul Hamid,

HEADWATER IS ALL OUT OF SORTS
AND MERCER WINS THE HANDICAP
Pat Morrissey Loses in a Nose Finish With First Shot.
Rollick Defeats Herculean, With David S in the Ruck.
Quoted at 15 to 1 in the Ring, Jim Hale Is Not Headed.
ON Saturday last, with two-third3
of the crowd down hook, line and
sinker on Green Morris' two-year
old Sombrero to win the handi
cap, Headwater dropped along at
10 to 1 and beat him just a nod. At Oak
land yesterday Headwater was one of. six
starters in the Racine handicap over six
furlongs and received so much attention
that he closed equal favorite with Mercer.
When the barrier was released by Starter
Dwyer, Headwater broke with the others,
then changed his mind and propped. If
Hughey Jones' sprinter persists in this
gayety. a diet of smokeless powder well
mixed with melanite and percussion caps
ought to do him a world of good. After
leading until well on toward the stand
Master Redfern brought Mercer to the
fore from fifth place, winning by more
than a length, and covering the seven fur
longs in 1:26^4. O'Connor, on Janice, got
pocketed in the stretch, or the filly might
have been second.
While three unsteady favorites landed
purses. First Shot and Jim Hale added
additional spice and snap to the game by
slipping in first at long odds. Neither was
according much backing from the outside
public.
Only a fairly well played favorite at
odds of 2 to 1, Autumn Time, ridden by
Ransch, took the maiden -two-year-old
event by a neck from the 15 to 1 shot
Knockings. The latter, together with the
40 to 1 outsider Dwight Way, made the
running to the stretch. Stuart was thrown
from King Herald soon after the start,
escaping injury.
Owen Mounce rode a perfect race on
Huachuca in the Futurity course sprint
for two-year-olds, beating Jarretierre
d'Or a head on the wire. Ishtar, with
Bullman up, was made favorite, and after
leading past the far turn was passed by
Huachuca. The latter was hard pressed
the last eighth to stall off Spencer's rush
with Jarretierre d'Or.
After leading all the way in the mile
selling run Pat Morrissey lost the deci
sion in an exceedingly close finish to
First Shot, a 9 to 1 chance, piloted by
Mounce. Dr. Bernays ran in a good posi
tion from the start, but apparently could
close no ground in the run home. Plead
made her first appearance, finishing
fourth.
At the close of the betting on the six
and a half furlong sprint Rollick and Da
vid S were about equal favorites. There
was some delay caused by the unruly ac
tions of Gibraltar and Aloha II. When
sent away Maresa picked up the running,
leading into the straight for the stand,
where Rollick with Buchanan up assumed
the lead, downing Herculean a length.
A well developed plunge was made on
Bob Smith's Greyfeld to take the mile
and seventy yards selling number, and he
finished third. McGinn let Jim Hale sift
along out In front, and -when hurrying up
time came he could not be caught, lead-
Ing out Horton four lengths. Greyfeld
ran a close third.
TTack Notes.
Frank Phillips, the well known owner,
is out again after a severe attack of ap
pendicitis. Frank was kept busy at the
track receiving the congratulations of his
many friends.
Theodore Winters watched' the sport
from the trainers' stand. Mr. Winters 5s
down from Rancho del Sierras with a fine
crop of yearlings, which will shortly be
seen in the sales ring.
Bob Smith, the owner of Greyfeld. has
secured a lease on the brown colt Articu
late from W. C. de B. Lopez. Peter Weber
has been training the three-year-old since
the opening of the season.
While being galloped on the inside track
yesterday morning Mike Daly's two-year
old Sir Tom Tiddler bolted and in some
manner broke his shoulder. It was found
necessary to destroy him.
Headwater acted very rank when
brought out on the track to be warmed
up, and there were many predictions that
he would not leave the barrier. Unfortu
nately for the sprinter's backers, they
â were fulfilled.
Jim Hale equaled the coast mark of
1:44 for one mile and seventy yards. The
track at Oakland is so fast that the equal
ing or smashing of records is becoming
j nearly as monotonous as the megaphone
announcement at a bicycle meeting of
"a-n-o-t-h-fe-r r-e-c-o-r-d b-r-o-k-e-n."
The return to the saddle of Blrkenruth
yesterday was hailed with satisfaction by
everybody. Louis Ezell's rider is" decid
ipdly popular with the crowds, and his en
forced suspension of fifteen days for
, rousrh riding caused general grief.
Charley Ellison was up and about the
ring after a few days' vacation on sick
leave.
As yet Tommy Burns has failed to land
a winner. Some one of these days Tom
my will go down the -line and put about
four over the plate first.

noon's events: ,-â

motion that the affidavit was a duplicate
In all material respects of that filed on
December 2, which was withdrawn from
the files by permission of the court, he
said. He desired to file also an affidavit
of S. R. Calvin contradicting the testi
mony of Mrs. Minnie Jones. Mr. Heney
went on to state that he had corrected the
affidavit of Blake by striking out certain
irrevelant and incompetent matter and
that on December 3 Heney made applica
tion to the Hon. W. W. Morrow, Circuit
Judge, in chambers, for permission ' to
withdrawn the affidavit temporarily for
the purpose of removing said incompetent
and immaterial matter and for no other
purpose whatsoever.
Mr. Heney added that Mr. Blake had
gone to Seattle and could not be found.
The court denied Mr. Heney's motion
and stated that the Noyes case was
closed, so far as the reception of evitlcncs
was concerned. Mr. Heney's motion in
its statements of facts is in conflict with
the- record of the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals. The record, under date
of December 3, 1901, is as follows:
It appearing to the court that the affidavit
Of H. L. Blake heretofore filed was improperly
and inadvertently placed of record herein,
therefore, upon motion of Francis J. Heney,
counsel for the respondent, Arthur H. Noyes,
It is ordered that said affidavit be stricken from
the files of this court, and the clerk is directed
to forthwith return the original and copies
thereof to said counsel for destruction.

SUPREME COURT
FREES HANSTED
Defective Indictment Is
the Ground for
Reversal.
Fred Hansted, more familiar known as
"Professor Young Dutchy," who was sen
tenced to seven years' Imprisonment . in
the State penitentiary for complicity in
tbe famous conspiracy instigated by Jack
Chretien for the purpose of looting the
Sullivan estate, has secured his freedom
through a decision rendered by the Su
preme Court yesterday. The judgment of
the lower court is set aside on the ground
that the indictment was defective.
He was indicted by the Grand Jury In
July, 1900. In October of the same year
he was again indicted by the same Grand
Jury on the same charges. The Supreme
Court holds that this was illegal and that
Hansted's motion for dismissal of the
irdictment, which was presented by his
attorney, George D. Collins, should have
been sustained.
The Sullivan estate amounted to only a
few thousand dollars. Chretien thought
ho saw a chance to make some money and
evolved the scheme of creating an "absent
heir." Numerous documents were forged
ami Hansted was convicted of uttering
one of these instruments and securing a
portion of the estate thereby. Chretien is
serving fourteen years at Folsom for his
share in the transaction.

HAIR WON'T FALL OUT
If You Kill the Dandruff Germs With
i the New Treatment.
John N. Fuller, a well-known citizen of
Coif ax, Wash., says: "I had dandruff so
badly that it caked on my scalp. Herpi-
cide completely cured me." George H.
McWhirk of Walla Walla, Wash., says:
"Herpiclde completely cured. me of a bad
case of dandruff of 30 years' standing."
They took the only really sensible treat-
ment, a remedy that destroys the dan-
druff germâ Newbro's Herpicide. Stop
dandruff, hair won't fall out, but will
gicw naturally, luxuriantly. Allays itch-
ing instantly and makes hair glossy and
soft as silk. At druggists. One bottle will
convince any doubter of its' merits.
WISH TO ADOPT
JAPANESE CHILD
Two Women Ask Pos
session of Little Doris
Shumozumi.
Mrs. Smith and Mr&. Perkins
Want the Protege of Mrs.
D'Angelis.
Doris Hannah Shumozumi, the little
Japanese girl, seems to be a very valua
ble commodity in the guardianship mar
ket. Three women want her in their
homes and the ladies are making every
effort known in law to secure the custody
of the little one.
Doris' own father and mother are also
in the fight for the possession of the child.
They contemplate returning to Japan and
three weeks ago sought to recover the
child from Mrs. Susie d'Angelis, mother
of Jeff d'Angelis, the actor, who had pos
session of the little Japanese since she
was fourteen months of age. The writ
was denied, and the application of Mrs.
d'Angelis for letters of guardianship over
the child was also refused because she
had reared the little girl as a child act
ress, i '
Mrs. Sara M. Smith of 513 Leavenworth
street and Mrs. Charles B. PSrkins of 72S
Haight street then became imbued with
the idea that Doris would make a "cute"
addition to their households, and each of
them applied for the possession of the
child. Their petitions were heard by
Judge Kerrigan yesterday and will be
heard again to-day, as they offered so
much evidence in support of their claims
that Judge Kerrigan was compelled to
continue the case.
Little Doris was the most important
witness of the proceedings. She is an ex
ceedingly bright child and is well able to
take care of her own interests. When
asked if she loved her mother, she said:
"I like my mother, but I love 'Mamma
Susie." "
â¢'Who would you like to live with?" was
asked of her.
" 'Mamma Susfe, 1 " she quickly replied,
"and next to her my Aunty Smith."
Numerous witnesses testified to the good
character of the applicants for the letters
of guardianship and certified to the abil
ity of both of the women to care for and
rear a child.
Police Officer C. C. Clark testified that
he had. known the mother of the little
girl, Waki Shumozumi as an inmate in
one of the dens in St. Mary's street ami
the father as a hanger-on about the
house.
Mrs. Susie d'Angelis. who is the "Mam
ma Susie" referred to by Doris, testified
that when she was given the child almost
nine years ago the mother promised her
she would not try to take it from her.
"A short time after I got the child," con
tinued the foster-mother of Doris, "they
came to me and informed me they -were
fu lne u^ "turn to Japan. I surrendered
the child to them and they went to the
Orient. They returned in a short time
and gave the child into my care again.
A few weeks ago they made up their
minds to again return to Japan and tried
to take Doris. I refused to surrender the
little one, for neither of the parents are
fit persons to bring her up."
Both Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Perkins claim
they are actuated by a love for Doris and
a desire to save her from the sort of life
being led by her mother.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Nezv York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. Dec. 23.â To-day's stock mar
ket took en tbe tone of holiday dullness and
the volume of dealings fell away to little over
half a million shares, of which a large pro
portion was in Sugar. The fluctuations in the
ceneral market were not of great importance
cutside of Sugar. There M-as a disposition to
advance railroad stocks in the early dealings,
especially the coalers, but the steady liquida
tion in S-'ujjar had an unsettling influence as
tne f.t!S"n-.ss cf the call lean market discour
aged simulation. The bank3 st-nera.ly mark
ed up their standing cull loans to 8 per cen\
end the greater jiart of the day's loans were
made at that rate. The Incentive to business
In a call loan rate btlow 0 per cent, while
brokers charge their customers G per cent to
carry stocks, was, therefore, lacking, and
commission houses showed a languid interest
in the market. The deep cut of 25 points
made ty the American Sugar Refining Com
j>any in the price of susar, thus underbidding
their principal competitors, caused discussion
'of the probability of a resumption of a war
In the trade, but much attention was also
given assertions of the threat of competition
Browing out of the sroat increase in the pro
duction or beet eutjar and the low price at
which that sugar is telling. Only twice dur
ing the day did sugar rally as much as a
point to interrupt its persistent downward
course. The final price was the lowest price
*nd <i<*4 Â».elow Saturday's closing. The previ-
JSJi, tol C t *2 0 _l for this year waR broken at
312%. To-<3ay s final price was lOS^. Amal

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Dec. 23â Wheat had the floor
throughout the session. It alone of all the
grains showed a semblance of activity and had
a uniformly strong tone. At the outset cables
were weak and this with the break-up of the
cold weather presaged a setback for wheat.
It was with some surprise that traders saw a
steady opening and a still steadier advance In
the leading cereal. Weekly statistics were
slightly bullish, but the strength of Saturday
was carried over despite the holidays to-mor
row and Christmas, and there was a good
show of buying orders. /The scarcity of red
winter wheat and the anxiety of millers to se
cure what there was on the market, however,
did the work. Winter wheat sold in large lots
at 4 cents over May and 85c was quoted for
smaller sales. The foreign demand was re
ported good and private advices stated that
stocks abroad were too small to permit of any
decline in prices at Liverpool.
On these influences May, which opened %c
higher to %c lower at 80%@81%c, . sold up to
s^tt a closed strong, l@l%c higher at 82Â®
Corn had a dull, narrow market, little af
fected by the strength in wheat. . May cloasd
steady, unchanged to %c up at 67@67%c.
Oats had a fair commission house traJe and
were moderately active. May closed Â«c higher
at 45%@45%c.
Provisions had a steady market with lard
the leading product. May pork closed Toe up.

Lord Cardwell was In the habit of using
the church prayers at family prayers.
One day his valet came to him and said'
"I must leave your Lordship's service at
once." "Why, what have you to com
plain of?" "Nothing, personally, but
your Lordship will repeat every morn
ing: 'We have done those things which
we ought not to have done, and nave left
undone those things which we ought to
have done.' Now, I freely admit that I
have often done things I ought not, but
that I have left undone things that I
ought to have done I utterly deny, and
will not stay here to hear It said."âMil

CAPTAIN T. C. COLEMAN
DIES NEAR LOUISVILLE
Oldest Brother of Evan and Barry
Coleman of This City Passes
Away,
Louisville papers of late date tell of the
death at his home near that city of Cap
tain Thomas C. Coleman, brother of Evan
and Barry Coleman of this city and well
known to many people throughout the
State.
Captain Coleman was born in Cork, Ire
land, March 27, 1824. He was the oldest of
seven brothers and several sisters.
Mr. Coleman came to this country with
his brother in 1838, from Cork, Ireland.
Both gentlemen were young business men
of Cork.
For many years Mr. Coleman was con
nected with the steamboat traffic, which
was at that time the giant Industry of the
South. He ran with the New Orleans and
Cincinnati packet lines and was asso
ciated with his father, Thomas C. Cole
man, and his uncle, Captain John Cole
man.
It was while engaged in this business
that Mr. Coleman, then a steamboat cap
tain, kidnaped President-elect Zachary
Taylor by way of a joke. The Southern
idol had been elected President, and great
was the rejoicing. It was arranged by
New Orleans people that he should be
taken up the Mississippi River from his
plantation in a specially fitted boat, with
brass, bands and festivities befitting the
celebration. Captain Coleman with his
boat, the Saladin, came by a few hours
earlier than the vessel of honor and took
the President-elect on board, the latter
unaware that he had taken the wrong
boat. Captain Coleman was ever after
noted up and down the river as the only
man who had ever kidnaped a President
of the United States.
Captain Coleman was for many years
closely associated with his father in the
iron business, succeeded him as president
of the rolling mill company and continued
at the head of the corporation during its
existence. Since then he had been en
gaged in the business of an iron merchant
in association with his non, T. C. Coleman
Jr., and was regarded as a leading
authority on all matters pertaining to the
manufacture of iron.
Captain Coleraan was one of nature's
noblemen and as popular and well beloved
as any man in the State of Kentucky.
On July 3, 1849, Captain Coleman mar
ried Dulclnea, a daughter of General Wil
liam Johnson, a prominent farmer and
legislator of Scott County, Kentucky who
survives him. The union was blessed with
a large family of children, most of whom
have married and removed to other
States, but all are frequent visitors to the
paternal roof tree.
Captain Coleman's living children are:
Mrs. Edgar Moxham of New York, Mrs
Arthur Moxham of Sydney, Cape Breton
Canada; Mrs. Charles Marshall of Louis
ville. Mrs. Thomas Ward of Birmingham
Johnson Coleman of Washington, T C
Coleman Jr., Miss Bertie Coleman, Miss
Ophelia Coleman and Mrs. Jennie John
son.
For more than thirty years Captain
Coleman made his home at "The Mead
ows." his country seat in Bullltt County
on the line of the Louisville and Nash
ville Railroad, going in to his business in
the city in tho morning and returning in
the afternoon, thirty-five miles each day

HIS Broadway, Dec. 23.
All that is mortal of John J. Valentine,
the lato president of Wells, Fargo & Co.,
has been committed to the grave. The
last rites for the man whose strong per
sonality was a factor in the history of
California were held at 2 o'clock this aft
ernoon from the Church of the Adventâ
the church that he often endowed with
his presence and bounty.
Hundreds of people were there to honor
the memory of the deceased. They were
men and women in the highest walks of
life in California. Some of them were
men /With whom he had worked side by
side and helped to build the corporation
of which he was the head. Some were
the heads of railroads, some bank presi
dentsâall were warm personal friends
and many were fellow parishioners.
There were many sobs heard in the little
church where the parting scenes occurred
this afternoon.
The services were directed by the Right
Rev. William Ford Nichols of the Epis-
, copal church, assisted by the Revw Charles
Lathrop. rector of the Church of the Ad
vent. San Francisco, and an old personal
friend of the family, and the Rev. Wil
liam Carson Shaw, rector of the church
in which the dead lay. Bishop Nichols
was attired in a purple velvet beretta and
the other clergymen wore white surplices.
-A. full vested choir of men and women
was in attendance.
The remains were met by the choir and
clergy at the door of the church, whence
they had been borne from the late home.
As the casket was being taken up th6
main aisle to the altar Bishop Nichols
chanted the words of "I Am the Resurrec
tion and the Life." This ceremony was
followed by the reading of the Episcopal
burial service by the Rev. Dr. Lathrop
and the singing 1 of "Lead, Kindly Light,"
and "Art Thou Weary?" The prayers
were then read by the rector of tho
church, which concluded Hie service.
Spectators Show Respect.
As the remains were being borne from
the, church the spectators stood with
bared heads until they were placed in the
hearse. The pallbearers, all of whom
were members and employes of Wells,
Fargo & Co., were the following named:
Lewis Whipple, John Haran, O. M. Berry,
George K. Carndall, J. M. Packer and Ben

BITTER ATTACK
ON GARDEN CITY
Article in Los Angeles
Paper Is Traced to
Writer.
S-iecial Dispatch to Tin Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 23.â An article recent
ly published in the Los Angeles Times, de
faming the city of San Jose and calling
it the "Sodom of the Pacific Coast,"
formed the subject of an address by
Mayor Martin before the City Council
this evening. The article had been com
mented on in the various church pulpits
and other meetings and aroused consider
able ill-feeling, in view of. the fact that
'the Improvement Club was spending hun
dreds of dollars monthly to attract East
ern tourists to this city.
The Mayor's address opened with an
apology to the improvement committee,
which he had treated rather curtly at its
last meeting. He then said that he had a
report to read from Police Captain New
berry, whom he had commissioned to go
to Los Angeles and ascertain the name of
the author of the defamatory article. The
report showed that Franklin Hichborn,
an itinerant newspaper man and the Ex
aminer correspondent, had written the
article.
This threw the Council into a furor of
excitement. All the members expressed
themselves. Some said that any one who
would write such an article about his city
should be severely dealt with and one sug
gested that a coat of tar and feathers
would be a fitting measure, The report
was received and action went over for
further conference.
The article in question appeared in the
Times of September 3. After dubbing San
Jose "the Sodom of this coast" it went
on to say that this city, was worse mor
ally than Philadelphia. It continued:
There is a serpent in San Jose's Eden, a
Bang of political boodlers, the equal ot
which curses no other municipality of this
great commonwealth, not even Ban Francisco.
This corruption, the article declared, ex
tended from the Police Courts to the
Mayor's chair and from the kindergarten
to the head of the State Normal School
and all the courts of the county.

HARDWARE MAN
C. F. Emerson Is Held
Up by Three Men
in His Store.
Victor Mitchell, a Laborer
From Seattle, Robbed
in Chinatown.
The three men. â who held up Mrs. Oels
in her grocery store at 253 Stevenson

done a similar job at the hardware store
of C. F. Emerson, 521 Howard street, thÂ«s
same night.
Emerson reported at police headquarters
yesterday morning that he was In hi*
store Sunday night about 10 o'clock when
a man knocked at the front door, which
was locked. Emerson opened, the door
and the man said he wanted to buy a.
boiler and was in urgent need of it, or he
would not have disturbed Emerson after
the store was closed.
Emerson turned around to show the
man the boilers he had la stock -when ho
was struck a violent blow from behind,
which knocked him down. "While he was
on the floor the man grabbed him by the
throat and held him down. Just then two
other men ran into the store, and whiio
one turned off the gas the other went
through Emerson's pockets, taking |LJ
and his silver watch. The three men then
ran out of. the store- Emerson was so
weak from the blow and the choking ha
received that he was unable to follow tnem
or give the alarm. He could only describe
the man who wanted to buy the boiler,
as he did not get a good look at the other
two. The one who first entered was
about 25 years of age, five feet ten inches
tall, smooth shaven and dressed in dark
clothes. "â â¢
Victor Mitchell, a laborer, who arrived

through his pockets. He thinks they were
Chinese, but could not be sure. He was
arrested for drunkenness shortly after

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
RUNS IN THE PHILIPPINES
Secretary of the Navy Approves an
Opinion by the Judge Advocate â 
General.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â The Secretary
of the Navy has approved an opinion by
the judge advocate general that the Phil
ippine Islands are United States territory
so far as the statute of limitations applies
to naval offenses. In the case in ques
tion a sailor deserted from the navy over
two years ago and enlisted In the army.
His regiment was serving in the Philip
pines and he remained with It. The naval
authorities, learning of his whereabouts,
instituted proceedings for his trial by
court-martial on the charge of desertion.
The case came before the judge advocate
general, who decided that the statute of
limitations barred prosecution for the of
fense, it having occurred more than two
years ago, and the alleged deserter not
having left the territory of the United
State3. Secretary Long approved the
opinion and directed a discontinuation of
the proceedings against the sailor.

COURT UPHOLDS
THE DIRECTORS
Dissolves the Northern
Pacific Railway .
Id j unction,-â¢
Says Company Has the Right
to Retire Preferred iStock
at Par. â  â¢â¢â¢*
NEW YORK, Dec.. 23.â JusticeUScott in
the Supreme Court' 'to-day,'. ctissoTved the
Injunction obtained by Wolff Bros, and
others restraining the Northern Pacific
Railway Company from retiring the pre
ferred stock of $75,000,000 on January 27.
Justice Scott says the company, had the
positive right at Its option to retire the
preferred stock at par, and that its di
rectors were authorized to exercise that
option on behalf of the corporation. He
added:
The plaintiffs have no concern with what
may be done with the stock of the company
after the preferred shares have been retired,
or in consequence of such retirement, nor are
they in a position to question the manner In
which the company proposes to raise the money
to retire their shares, bo long -as they are as
sured of the par value thereof. Even if the de
fendant's right to I retire the plaintiffs' stock
was less clear than I deem it to be, I would
still hesitate to permit the temporary injunc
tion to stand. The plaintiffs, though holding
preferred stock to a considerable amount, real
ly hold but a â¢ small percentage of this class
of stock, and of course a much smaller per
centage of the total capital stock of the com
pany.
The claim is that they are entitled to an op
portunity to subscribe for the convertible cer
tificates representing common stock to be is
sued in place of the preferred stock.
Upon what that claim is based is not made
very apparent, but assuming that it is well
founded no reason is suggested why they can
not be fully and amply compensated in an
action for damages for the denial of their as
sumed rights. â¢

1IO SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
IN DANISH CESSION TREATY
Latest Suggestion Made Is to At
tempt to Determine the Matter
by a Plebiscite.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â The negotia
tions between the governments of the
United States and Denmark, looking to
th3 cession of the Danish West Indies, are
dragging. No substantial '. progress has
been made since last week. . The latest
supgestion from the Danish side Is that
the people of the islands shall determine
b;' a plebesclte whether they shall be
ccted to the United States. The outcome
of such a test cannot be foretold, for the
strong feeling of attachment for the
me ther country on the one hand might be
offset by. the great trade advantages ex
pected to follow the cession of the islands
to the United States. .

COUNSEL SCORES
"ELIJAH" DOWIE
Likens Him to a Devil-
Fish That Strangles
Its Victims.
CHICAGO, Dec. 23.â The closing argu
ment in the suit against "Dr." Alexander
Dowle for the appointment of a receiver
ship for his Zion lace Industries was be
gun by Attorney S. W. Packard to-day in
Judge Tuley's court. Packard denounced
the action of Samuel Stevenson, Dowle s
brother-in-law, in having brought the
suit and expressed the hope that his bet
ter spirit would move him. to a reconcilia
tion with Zlon. A strong plea was made
to show that Dowie was not infallible.
Attorney Packard likened Dowle to J. P.
Morgan as a great organizer, but said
he doubtless made mistakes.
"He does not claim to be more than hu
man," he said, "for in the Bible St. James
says Elijah was a man of like passions
with ourselves."
Packard in upholding Dowie's claims as
Elijah said that he would prefer him at
his bedside if he were at the point ot
death rather than any skilled physician.
Packard is not a member of the Zion
Congregation.
"Dr." Dowie and his wife were present
in court with by far the largest number
of followers that has yet filled the court.
During Attorney Packard's recital of
Dowie's Identity with "Elijah the Re
storer," Dowie frequently rolled his eyes
upward and gazed at the ceiling as though
in prayer.
Following Attorney Packard's argument
for the defense. Attorney F. L. Reeves,
for the plaintiff, likened Dowie to "'a
devil-fish that twined its arms about it3
victim and quieted him until it got a
strangle hold."
He touched upon the death of Mrs.
Stevenson, wife of the plaintiff and sister
of Dowie. and said that when Stevenson
in nis grief sought out Dowie as brother
and priest, Dowie gave him a cup of gall
and called him a murderer.
Arguments in the case closed this after
noon and the case was given into the
hands of Judge Tuley.

SETTLE CLAIM
OF MRS. KLUGE
Sutro's Heirs Give His
Alleged Widow
$100,000.
Prepare, However, to Contest
Payment of Special
Bequests.
The litigation following the filing of the
â will of the late Adolph Sutro is after
many years in a fair way of being ami
cably settled. Plans are now perfecting
â whereby the claim of Mrs. Clara Kluge,
v.ho alleges herself to' have been the con
tract wife of the deceased millionaire,
will be compromised on the basis of
Jloo.000. to be paid to her in full of- all
ciaims against the estate. " "
Mrs. Kiuge tiled a contest of Sutro s
â¢will shortly after that document was pre
sented for probate. She alleged that she
married -Sutro unaer a civil contract and
tnat ne was the father of her children.
The furtner claim was made that.- Sutro
had publicly acknowledged the children
and tnat he paid all the expenses of their
mother until his death. Mrs. Kluge says
lurther mat Sutro promised to maice pro>
â¢viEion for herself and children- in his will,
but this he failed to do. Hence her con
test.
Subsequent to the "filing of this contest
another contest was filed by Mrs. Rose
Sutro Morbio, Clara Sutro Knglish, Kate
Sutro Nussbaum and Edgar A. Sutro,
heirs-at-law of decedent, all of whom al
leged unjust discrimination. Since the
proceedings were begun the court. has de
cided against the trust created under Su
tro's will, and the residuary estate will
now go to the heirs-at-law without dis
pute. What the heirs are at present fight
ing is the proposition of paying several
special bequests amounting to about $375,-
OuO. The contest of Mrs. Kluge was di
rected especially against these bequests,
although a widow's share in the residu
ary estate was also demanded.
From time to time reports of the settle
ment of Mrs. Kluge's claim have been
circulated, but the first definite â¢ informa
tion to that effect was vouchsafed in
Judge Coffey's court yesterday, when the
contest was called for trial. Attorney
Van R. Paterson, representing Mrs.
Kluge, announced that the claim of his
client had been settled and that she was
willing to dismiss her contest.
\>hen this statement was made Charles
S. Wheeler, attorney for the heirs-at-law,
said he did not know of any settlement,
and that so far as his clients were con
cerned the compromise with Mrs. Kluge
was unauthorized. They were therefore
determined to press their contest to the
end. On this statement the court set the
Morbio contest for hearing on January lfi.
Notwithstanding this action the claim
is still made that the compromise with
Mrs. Kluge will not be affected by the
Morbio contest and that this contest will
also be dismissed in time. It is hinted
that the papers compromising Mrs.
Kluge's claim will be presented in court
next month.

DEUGGISTS MUST TAKE
OUT LIQUOR LICENSES
Sixteen of Them Reprimanded, by
the Board of Police Com
missioners.
Sixteen druggists appeared before the
Police Commissioners last night to show
cause why they should not pay a retail
license for selling liquors in small quanti
ties. As they maintained that they did
not know that it was necessary to take
out a. liquor license they were let off with
a reprimand.
A charge of improper conduct against
Police Officer Robert Lean was dismissed
by the board.
Officer Barney Harter. one of the most
popular members of the department, was
restored to his former rank of sergeant.
Harter some years ago was a regular ser
geant, but was disrated without the for
mality of a trial. He appealed to the
courts and a decision was rendered in his
favor. When the writ of mandate is
sued by Judge Hebbard was received by
the Commissioners last night, on motion
of Mahoney, it was unanimously agreed to
abide by it. Harter was then formally re-
BtorÂ«Â«d to his former rank of sergeant.
A number of saloon-keepers appeared
before the board in response to a citation
to show cause why their licenses should
not be revoked for maintaining nickel-in
the-slot machines which paid in cash. As
it was announced that the City and
County Attorney had not yet rendered an
opinion as to whether or not Chief Witt
man had the power to destroy the ma
chines which were confiscated by his men,
Commissioner Wallace moved that the
machines be returned to their owners on
condition that they do not use them in the
future. Commissioner Newhall thought
that the board should hear irom the City
Attorney before taking final action and on
his suggestion the matter went over for
one week.

pÂ»y|-^ ESTIMONT of a sensational char-
I acter was adduced In Judge Fritz's
1 1 court yesterday during the hear-
UL ing of the case of the people
against Mrs. Reeves-Atkinson.
The defendant is the keeper of a sanita
rium at 1815 Sutter street, and her neigh
bors are striving to have her seek quar
ters elsewhere, as they claim her place Is
a nuisance.
Mrs. Alma E. Keith, the milliner, was
a witness for the prosecution. She had

according to her testimony, suffered un
told misery. She swore that she had been
cruelly beaten by the defendant and un-

der oath stated that one man was beaten
to death by the keepers and was. after
ward removed by the Morgue wagon. She
also accused Dr. William Hlmmelsbaeh
of 1815 Scott street of many indiscretions.
Mrs. Keith Testifies. v
When court convened In the afternoon
Mrs. Keith, accompanied by her â  friend
and legal adviser. Judge Black of â  San
Jose, entered the courtroom. There was
a craning of necks, as it was known that
she would give testimony of a sensational
nature. She was becomingly attired in
black. Mrs. Keith was the first witness
called.
In answer to questions asked by.Attor
ney George "W. Monteith, she testified that
she was a victim of the house, conducted
by Mrs. She said she had been
taken to the sanitarium for treatment.
She denied that she .was insane or ever
had been so. She was simply taken there
for rest and quiet, and failed to get either.
She admitted she Vas hysterical and was
taken there to be cured.
Mrs. Keith stated that she had been an
inmate of the hospital from July to Oc
tober, 1900; that during her stay she heard
the most outlandish noises during the day
and night. The cries were those of peo
ple being beaten and were "help!" "mur
der!" and agonizing shrieks. She said
she also did a great deal of the yelling in
order to let the neighbors know she was
there. â  .
"They beat me innumerable times," she
testified. - i
"Who beat you?" asked M. Monteith.
"Mrs. Atkinson, Mrs. Wadsworth and
Mr. Ewing." v.
"How did- they strike you?"
"They .used their fists, broom handles
and with the heel of my own slipper."
Further testifying, she stated that she
had seen and heard the keepers beating
and abusing- their patients. â¢ â¢ â  .'â¢ .. .
"One night I heard the man in the room
next to mine yell in agony: 'Takeher off!
She's killing me!'. There was a crash of
crockery and all was still. The next day
the Morgue wagon came and took v his
body away."
Tells of Suffering'.
Mrs.. Keith stated that' the condition of
the bedding was terrible. She said it was
taken into the yard to air and was cov
ered with blood and filth and the odor
was very offensive. She said the patients
were stripped of their, clothes and most
of them were punished. , She said Mr.
Ewing, an attendant, was in the habit of
going through the halls in a nude condi
tion. -
"Mrs. Francis Thauson, whom I after
ward succeeded In having- taken from the'
place, was brutally beaten for scream
ing," said Mrs. Keith. "We were choked
and compelled to wear armulets, strait
jackets and anklets. J Even dogs were
turned on us."
Mrs. Keith said she was not forced, to
enter the institution. She was led in by
Dr. Himmelsbach. When she got in she
declined to go upstairs, and the attend
ants, assisted by Dr. Himmelsbach, drag
ged her. She said they caught her by
the hair and she screamed from pain.
She was often sent out Into the yard in
a wrapper and frequently was struck by
attendants, she continued.
The witness under j cross-examination 1
told how Mrs. Atkinson beat her servant,
Miss Smith. The proprietress abused peo
ple for the pleasure of doing so, she said
"Why did she beat her servant?" asked
the prosecuting attorney.
"Because she failed to feed fifty people
on five potatoes."
The witness said that a man named Pat
Nado was cruelly beaten. She said she
looked through the crack In the partition
and saw him suffering. . She denied that
for four months she was violently insane.'
She denied that she ever requested to go
back to the institution, but admitted hav
ing paid a visit there for the purpose of
securing evidence in order to have Mrs
Thauson taken to the Masonic Home at
Decoto.
Dr. Himmelsbach's Conduct.
In speaking of Dr. Himmelsbach she
said:
TPIE DEFENDANT, THE PRINCI
PAL WITNESS AND SOME OF
THE INCIDENTS DESCRIBED.
"He dragged me up the stairs and then
threw me on the floor and held a pillow
over my head to stifle niy screaming. He
nearly choked me. He is not my family
physician and never was. He is a vestry
man- of the Episcopal church, and I see
by the papers that he is making it lively
for the church people. My husband was
very deaf and he was a victim of th<3
duplicity of Dr. Himmelsbach and this
Atuinscn woman. They got him to put
me in the sanitarium and they kept me
there."
At this juncture Attorney William J.
Herrin, who represents Mrs. Atkinson,
could not restrain himself. "So your duti
ful husband stood it all." he said.
"Don't you cast reflections on my hus
band, sir. I won't "have my husband in
sulted by any man. Look here. Judge,
that man Is insulting me," Mrs." Keith
said angrily.
As a parting bit of testimony Mrs. Keith
stated that Dr. Himmelsbach told Mrs.
Atkinson to keep the Italian woman as
long as she. could, because even if they
did not get money the house would be
furnished with fresh vegetables.'

was the next witness. She testified that
her house overlooked the sanitarium;
that she had heard most unearthly noises
and yells; that neither herself nor hus
band were able to sleep, and that she
became so nervous she was obliged to
leave home. She had seen poor, inof
fensive people beaten.
"By whom?" asked Monteith.
"By that woman," cried the witness as
she dramatically pointed' to Mrs. Atkin
son.
She told of seeing an old woman in the
yard unable to move because of the
straitjacket she was compelled to wear.
Mrs. Hendy said the woman sat there for
hours and suffered terribly from wind arid
sun and no one paid any attention to her.
Mrs. Mitchell, who resides at 1825 Sut
ter street, testified to the noises, and
Mr. Scheldt of 1927A Sutter street said
she owned property In the vicinity and
her tenants were threatening to move if
the noises and scenes in the neighborhood
did not discontinue. . She stated she had
seen people beaten and had suffered from
the odors. ' .â¢ Â«
. Miss Clara Guckenheim proved *a strong
witness for the prosecution. She lives
next door to the Sanitarium. The young
lady told of the scenes she had witnessed
and her statements were very positive.
She said a man once escaped from the
Institution and rushed into their house
and grabbed her grandmother; that her
relative was so scared that she became
ill. Miss Guckenheim said she was made
so nervous by the screams that she was
unable to stay home; that she,, lived with
friends for more than a year. She told
of the patrol wagons and" hacks that
would come .to the place at all hours in
the morning, and how the people hrought
there were dragged in or enticed by
liquor. She admitted having seen people
brutally beaten.
"I have seen Mary Smith, their servant,
beaten, and when she screamed Mrs. At
kinson yelled. 'I will put a hvperdermic
in her that will lay her low If she does
not. stop making noise' "
The prosecution then closed its case
and the trial was continued until Janu

ADTERTISBMENTS.
M'PIKE SCORES
THE WITNESSES
Attorney Says Knowl
ton's Accusers Are
All Biased.
Interest in the Knowlton inquiry was
again at its height yesterday when At
torney H. C. McPike, on behalf of Knowl
ton, made an autopsical speech cutting
into every fiber and nerve of the evidence
given before the Beard of Education by
Accuser Lyser and his chief witnesses,
Morton and Clark. McPike placed the
testimony of the gentlemen named on the
slab for dissection, and performed the op
eration without regard to the sensitive
ness of those present or absent. He
pointed out the part?, which he considered
weak, 'and one of these was the fact that
no less than nine teachers had in the
short space of five months preceded Pro
fessor Knowlton, and Knowlton himself
had held office in Lyser's company for the
brief period of only two months. Ergo,
was there not something radically wrong
when teachers were changed about and
sent right-about In such quick order?
The Board of Education, declared Mc-
Pike, deserved congratulation for the ju
dicial lines it had followed during the in
vestigation of his client. Evidence of an
illegal character had been eliminated and
great patience had been shown, but he
deplored the fact that their valuable time
had been demanded for four or five days
when accuser and witnesses called to
back up and support a charge had proved
their utter inability to do so. Lyser had
made the charges, however, and McPike
agreed that the board had the right on
its side to call upon him to substantiate
them,
As to any charge of incompetency he
submitted that that was not a matter for
which his client could be tried. If he was
a teacher it was presumed that he was
competent. He had received the license
of a competent teacher, but the language
of Lyser's charge was "incompetency"
and "unfitness." If a teacher were guilty
of intemperance or the use of profane
language that would establish an "untit
ness," which the board would quickly deal
with. McPike showed that so long ago
as eleven years Knowlton taught with the
witness Morton, whose testimony, he sub
mitted, was ancient history- If then In
competent surely he would have been
found out long before thisâ yes his in
ccirpetency would have been discovered
in less than a year. The board would
have found out any shortcoming in him
in short order. Indeed.
Clark Couldn't Produce.
Clark testified that Knowlton'a "meth
ods of teaching were not to his liking," a
conclusion arrived at also many years
ago. Still, all that could be deduced
from such evidence was that it was only
an opinion as to a method of teaching.
Clark had not been able to give a single
illustration to prove that Knowlton had
not pursued a proper, course.
McPike then alluded to a history of the
United States written by Clark, and
raised a good deal of mirth by declaring
that in his work he even failed to mention
where the United States was nor did he
state the square miles. Thereupon Chair
man Casserly interjected the belief that
Bancroft had been guilty of a similar neg
ligence. McPike quickly retorted that if
Bancroft did not do so he was grievously
wrong, and with his example any man
who wrote a history and did not impart
the situation of the country was
wrong. Any stranger reading Mr. Clark's
history would wonder where the United
States was situated. Turning back to
Morton, McPike charged that the witness
had rankling in his heart some misunder
standing between himself and Knowlton
as long as ten . years ago. The attorney
reviewed Morton's answers to the board
during his examination, and criticized in
severe terms his negative replies when
questioned as to his knowledge of Greece.
Under those circumstances the attorney
contended that Morton -was eminently un
fit to criticize Knowlton, who had shown
and proved his ability and knowledge.
The whole sum and substance was that
Morton and Clark disliked Knowlton, and
years ago Morton wanted Clark to file re
ports against Knowlton. Adverse -wit
nesses, however, had eulogized Knowlton.
His reputation began at the portals of
Harvard, and he had conducted 101 in
stitutes. McPike then denounced his
client's accusers, and said he would like
to know which of the two could even
speak "and read the better, Knowlton or
Lyser. Then, in contrasting the two men,
he spoke of the ready answers of his
client and "the halty and mushy expres
sions of Lyser as he sat there trying to
blast Knowlton's reputation for life."
McPike Attacks Morton.
Returning again to Morton, Attorney
McPike declared that "his evidence was
absolutely unworthy of credence." and
likened him to Majocci, who was called
by Lord Brougham "the non ml recordo
witness," through the fact that when
called upon to back up charges made
against Queen Caroline he simply knew
nothing against her.
McPike then touched upon Lyser's
statement that "the class went to pieces
when Knowlton came and behaved like
a pack of demons." . â¢ :
"Miss Hobe," said McPike, "had given
the lie to the statement of Mr. Lyser. I
do not like to use strong epithets, but I
cannot characterize his statement in lan
guage lesa strong."
Pupils' statements favoring Knowlton
were reviewed, and the kindly spirit
which he always exhibited in conjunction
with his method* of teaching was dwelt
upon by the attorney. Over thirty years
of hard -work in schools here had not
hardened him*
McPike then spoke of the strain that be
sets both teachers and pupils. "Four hun
dred boys were huddled together, like sol
diers in constraint, and It is a wonder to
me that they left a bit of walnscotine- in
the schoolroom." said McPike. "The spirit
of the child cannot bÂ« subduedâ it cannot
be held in iron bands. Knowlton may
not have been the strictest disciplinarian,
neither was the great General Grant, but
that did not prevent glorious results
"Some teachers impart knowledge" with
the harshness of a martinet, while other
teachers are softer and kinder. A teacher
must govern his conduct of a class ac
cording to the disposition of the children."
At the conclusion of Attorney McPike's
address the board adjourned. The whole
of the evidence will be read and then a
conclusion will be reached. The members
of the board present were: John Casserly.
presiding; James Denman, C. W. Mark
and Mrs. M. W. Kincaid. -*Â«Â«.
LAW ON PERCENTAGE POKER
IS TO BE AGAIN TESTED
Managers of the Cafe Royal and

ple have won.
