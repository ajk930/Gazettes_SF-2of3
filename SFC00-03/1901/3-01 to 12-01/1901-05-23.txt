Children Devoured ; by < a Bear.
JOB, W.-Va.. May 22.â The three chil
dren of E. P. Porterfield; a mountaineer,'
residing about twelve miles southeast of
this place,', while gathering flowers in the
woods were killed and partially, devoured
by a bear. Â¦ The remains. were found by a
searching party, which had been out since
Sunday evening. The bear was .discovered
later and killed. 'Â¦.-".*'-",
The children â¢ were Mary, aged three
years;. 'Willie, aged five, and- Henry.- aped
seven.-" The parents are almost- crazed
with grief, the bereavement leaving them
childless. . â¢ r :
that his niece concurred with him in be- j
lieving a conservator necessary. â¢
The present action, according to state
ments of Lyons to the jury, was precipi
tated by the demands made in February
last from Egypt for $50,000 to -pay the
woman's accumulated debts. These, had
accumulated in two years. This bill was
the large'st ever. presented. Her previous
record had" bejn the spending of 160.CO0
francs In Paris in six weeks. All of these
bills Lyons,: as trustee, .had; to settle out
of the principal of the woman's fortune. '
When the debts In Egypt were discov
ered Lyons arranged a meeting with his
niece in London.' She then acknowledged
that she was incapable of .resisting the
temptation of. buying whatever she
wanted. â / -

s^j AN JOSE, May 2Lâ With a half
(t^ century marking its existence, the
University of the Pacifies the old-
est Methodist college in the West,
commenced the celebration of its
golden jubilee this afternoon. This is an
important e^och in the history of the
Methodist church on the coast, for almost
as soon as that religious organization had
sent its pioneer missionaries to the coast
the Central Missionary Board of New
York began layiAg plans for founding an
institution for educating the young of
that faith and for providing ministers.
In 1S48 the rush of gold hunters to Cali
fornia had caused missionaries to be sent
here, and in that little band of workers
"was Isaac Owen, the .principal founder of
the university. The Missionary Board of
Xew York in lÂ£S0 decided to establish in
California an institute of learning under
the patronage of the Methodist Episcopal
church. - At that time Isaac Owen was the
presiding elder of the California district
and to him fell the work of establishing
the school. That he builded well Is at
tested by the university, with its many
fine buildings and beautiful grounds,
r.-hich sprang from a small beginning at
San Jose.
In the fifty years just passed the school
has cut an important figure in the educa
tional world of the Pacific Coast Its
alumni includes prominent men and wo
men in all walks Of life, and many of
these gathered to-day to renew friend
ships and do honor to their alma mater.
From all over the State they have come
to join In the golden jubilee.
The University of the Pacific Is the old
est chartered college in California, having
received its charter on July 10, 185L It

| Lipton. '; The result3 of "this disastCT,
which could scarcely- recur; without great
loss ,.of life, can best be judged by the
written \ statement I made late to-night ; by
Sir,v Thomas "Lipton^ to a representative
of the Associated Press, as follows: : ' .
' My deepest 'regret 1 , is ' that to-day's accident
prevents me from toeing the mark at the ap
pointed hour, and compels n:e to ask the New
York Yacht Qlub. to grant me an extension of
time. 7 -. If : they .will be good, enough to do that
I shall race, even- If 1 1 have to build a boat
between now and tho date agreed" upon. I

to be the challeneer. and that when this un- j
fortunate . chapter oc accidents j comes | to " an

The press tug following the races ranged
alongside the helpless yachts and a tor
pedo boat which was in the vicinity and
the Sybarlta sent boats to the*:ene. But.
in answer to a- hall, Captain Sycamore
sent i. the reassuring, message; that -' all on
board had escaped .without injury. ' "_
; Owing to the unwieldy nature of the
spars and gear it. was found impossible to
get~them on board and- they were -cut
away and allowed to sink, after, buoys had
been placed to mark the. places. where the

YT ITTLE developed yesterday In the

I .men met at their headquarters
: JJL=^. 'and listened. to reports'of pickets

made. The employers repeated the propo
sition that each , Individual plaint, would
be considered,* but would say. nothing fur

NEW YORK. May 22.â The- confer
ence committees . of the Â¦ Metal
Trades. Association and the
Trades Union held a conference
to-night for nearly two hours
and the two resolutions offered, the one
embodying 1 the demand of the employers
\hat the men return to work pending arbi
tration and the other resolution securing
to the employes the nine-hour day without
reduction In wages, were both lost by tie
votes and were referred to the two asso
ciations i for a voto - of the organizations
embraced in those associations.
It is possible, that the vote will be taken
to-morrow and there will be another con
ference in the evening, though it may bo
found that several days - will be needed
to obtain a vote.- r-
This leaves the strike in force and the
\k - President
CConnell of the International Association
of Machinists estimates that the num
ber of machinists engaged in the strike
to-day Is 40,000. He claims to be satis
fied with the situation and has confidence
In the result. He said: .
By next' Monday mornlne probably 9Â©' per
cent of the. men who went out will be back at
work with their demands granted. The other
10 per cent are mostly on the Pacific Coast and
In several Ohio cities.. -San Francisco is the
only place where we look for a protracted
strike - The - situation there Is good and 4hc
strike may cover several weeks. Xo Important
developments are reported at Cincinnati, though
most of the small firms have signed the agree
ment. The situation also la unchanged at
Hamilton. Dayton and Alliance. Ohio, and Ta
coma and Seattle. Wash. Reports from p.l
other sections indicate that negotiations are
progressing and that agreements are In sight.
President Mulholland of the Allied Metal
Trades Association, comprising the semi
skilled men In machine shops, has notified
the machinists' headquarters here that he
is ready to order out his men whenever
the latter body deems it necessary. The
strike leaders, however, do not care to
involve any more men in the movement
than Is necessary and the indications are
that there will be .no general augmenta
tion of the force of the strikers by the al
lied men.- Kansas City advices report
nine new firms there signed to-day. Four
teen firms in Hoboken have signedr In
Buffalo twenty-two firms are reported
as having made agreements with the
strikers. AÂ£ Sharon, Pa., the Continental
Iron -Company has signed and the Hazel

yesterday afternoon. Fully 15,

almost as densely as on the occasion of
the parade In honor of the President's ar
rivaL .
The rattle of horses' hoofs, the blare of
brass instruments, the tramp of marching
columns, and the shouts of command lent
aid to the brilliant military pagreant af

H Friday afternoon to review tho

by prominent citizens of Oak
' land, including United j States Senator
George C. Perkins, Congressman Victor
H. Metcalf. Collector of Port Frederick S.
Stratton, United States Naval Officer John
P. Irish and Edson F. Adams, chairman
of the citizens' executive committee.
Those close to the President declare that
he- feels profoundly the sentiments ex
pressed far and wide concerning Mrs. Mc-
Kinley, and he desires, in so far as her
condition will permit, to take part in the
public displays which had been arranged
in honor of himself and his party.
Details of the reception and review will

of magnificent uniforms produced a scene
that excelled any which San Francisco
has arranged in honor of the President's
visit.
In Mechanics* Pavilion there vras gath
ered an assemblage such as Is seldom col
lected under the roof of that building.
The seats were all occupied, and hundreds
stood throughout the ceremony. Fourteen
thousand tickets had been issued and
more than that number of persons were
in the Pavilion in addition' to the thousand
Sir Knights In uniform. 5S
Enthusiasm was at its highest pitch,
and the fervent expressions of fraternal
affection and of patriotic devotion with
which the ceremony was replete were re
ceived with warm approval by the audi
ence, and freauent storms of applause
swept over the tiered seats of the great
Pavilion, accompanied by frantfc waving
of flags.
Patriotic Fervor.
Withal there was more even of patriotic
fervor in the reception than of fraternal
greeting. While emblems of the Masonic
order were conspicuous on all sides and
the ceremonies had about them the charm
of Masonry, the flag was not forgotten,
and the free masonry of citizenship in
free America was given much more prom
inence than the fraternal relations within
the order. v
President McKinley himself set the ex
ample in his speech upon being introduced
to the Sir Knights present, and through
out the ceremony country was first and
Masonrr was second.' this fact civlne to
the reception the tone of a whole-souled
love-feast of patriotism, with fraternalism
e.s its foundation.-
The President pronounced the parade
and reception unique and uncommon, dif
ferent from anything he had witnessed
since leaving Washington, and in private
conversation* afterward he said it was
the most memorable event of all that had
occurred since his trip began, excelling
any spectacle or reception that -*"ad been
planned in his honor.
Mechanics' Pavilion was brieht with the
national colors. Flags and streamers and
bunting disguised the rough interior and
tirade it a place of beauty.
For the accommodation of the men of
the order all the space of the huge plat

Memorable Scene in Pavilion.
When the President had entered be
tween double files of Sir Knights extend
ing from the entrance to the steps of the
platform at the far west end of the Pa
vilion and had taken his place in a rich
leather-upholstered chair in the center of
the front of the, platform, with General
W H L. Barnes at his right hand and
Grand Commander George B. McKee of
San Jose and Grand Generalissimo \\\ IX
Knights of Sacramento on his left, and
the various commanderies- had marched
past him and taken up their positions on
the platform, the interior of the big struc
ture presented a memorable scene. The
President leaned back in his chair in
happy repose, drinking in delightedly the
beauty of the spectacle before him. Two
â¢walls of faces rose on the sides and a sea
of humanity stretched out in front of him,
Â¦while higher up. In the gallery, a wide
band of faces stretched along either side
until in the distance, at the far end. indi
viduals were indistinguishable except to
the keenest of eyes. /
The ceremony was carried out with a
promptness and dispatch that permitted
no awkward pauses or intervals, and drill
and chant, song and addresses occupied In
all less than half an hour. But into that
6hort space of time were crowded Impres
sive features that will make the event
live many years In the memories of those
who were present.

at the main entrance on Larkin street.
Word quickly went from section to sec

"The President. is coming." The applause
increased, the flags fluttered, the band
played and the great assemblage, rising,
saluted the illustrious guest with Joyful
acclaim. The volume of ,the applause
grew as the President on the arm of Gen
eral W. H. L. Barnes -walked bet-ween the
double rank of Templars from the Pa
vilion entrance to the platform at the
west end. A great wave of applause was
the signal when the President, after as
cending the steps leading to the stage,
stood out apart from others and.grace
fully by motion of the head and hand ac
knowledged the cordial greeting of the
people. -
Drill Corps Evolutions.
After the various commanderies were
seated on the platform or assigned to
places specially reserved for Knights in
uniform the drill corps of California Com
mandery, headed by- a continental band
came in. The,Presldent joined In the hand

of the exhibition of drilling. The chant

invocation. . After this solemn '. rendition
General Barnes introduced President Mc-
Kinley in the following, words:
The President Speaks.
Sir Knights, Masons, Friends: I have the
distinguished honor of presenting to you Sir

As early as 1 o'clock there were steady
lines seeking admission to the airy and
well arranged building. Sections were re

and . balconies presented a fine scene of
animation. Apparently all the places were
taken, but spaces scarcely visible from the

deportment of the vast audience evoked
many compliments.

Xxsague of the Cross. 1 am told â a fact of
which you all may well be proud, a fact that
brings to me tatisfaction to relate â that when
the war with Spain came, when It could no
longer be avoided, every young man of this
Fplendld organization who was eligible ten
dered his services to the Governor of his State
?great applause), and that in nearly all the
regiments that went to the distant Philippines
to euÂ£te.ln the honor of the country and to
Kive freedom to an oppressed people, this
League had some of its best blood and some
of Its noblest young men; and that you not
only contributed from your ranks to the army
in the Philippines, but that your representa
tives were in Cuba, both in the army and in
the navy at Santiago when the surrender was
mad* to General Shafter (great applause), who
sits on my left; that you were represented in
that splendid fight made by the fleet of Ad
miral Sampson and destroyed the sea power
in this hemisphere of our then enemy, now
our friend : anil that one of your lads was on
the ship Olympia with Admiral Dewey (grea.t
applause) when he sailed into Manila Bay.
The President's Praise.
â¢ to speak there was the most absolute
silence. He 6poke in his usual tone, but
his words were not lost in the farthest
corners of the immense, building. It was
expected he would epenk for but a few
moments, but when he went from words
of greeting to speak to the boys of their
pledge and their example the enthusiasm
knew no bounds, and toward the close of
his address the cheers would break in
upon him as he paused for breath, and the
Hags would spring into life once more
.ik the people grave free rein to their ap
plause. The President said:

King Humbert '-was ' ehot ' by . Angelo

All of these claims, with the exception of
Nos. 2526 and 2S67, were approved by the Board
cf Examiners prior to January 1, 1899, and were
transmitted to the Legislature under section 663
of the Political Code, with the recommendation
f Controller's Department,
SACRAMENTO, May 22.â The Sheriffs
of the various counties in the 3tate who
have been waiting three years for pay for
conveying insane patients to the State
asylums have not yet received their coin
and it would appear that if the policy of
Secretary Daniel Kevane of the State
Board of Examiners is to rule it will be
many, a day before the Sheriffs will have
a ichance to cash their warrants.. There
have come to light details of a. remark
able procedure on the part of Secretary
Kevane, amounting to little less than a
mutilation of records. Apparently acting
upon his own authority the Secretary has
pared down the claims of the Sheriffs to
suit his own .viewsâ this after they were
passed by the Board of Examiners and
their payment provided for by the Legis
lature. Now Controller Colgan has refused
to draw warrants for the claims, basing
his action on the ground: that they nave
been illegally mutilated.
Claims Are Twice Passed.
The Sheriffs" claims for conveying the
insane to the asylums for the year ending
June 30 were duly audited by the State
Boaxd of Examiners, of which James H.
Budd, Governor at the time, was the ex
offlcio president There was not enough
money to pay them, and, following the
procedure set by law, the Board of Exam
iners transmitted them > to the Legislature
in the report of December 1, 1898, with
the request that provision be made, to pay
them. The , claims aggregated $3164 30.
The Legislature of 1899 passed a bill ap
propriating the money to pajj t n fs e
claims, but Governor Gage withheld his
signature, it being among: measures
rushed through at the close of the ses
sion. Again, last year, the Board of Ex
aminers applied to the i Legislature for
money to pay these claims and an appro
priation was passed and signed by the
Governor. ; _
Last month the bills came down to the
State Controller's office from the Board of
Examiners, but instead of appearing in
the sums set out in the two annual reports
of the Examiners, they were cut down in
the majority of instances, evidently by
somebody in the office of the Board, of
Examiners. .
What happened to the , claims is best
told in the following letter, which has
been filed with the Board of Examiners,
the letter book copy of which was shown
by the Controller on the demand of The

Indian Agent.
Faction of Tribe Is Restless
and Will Hold a
.. ' i Sun Dance.
WASHINGTON, May 22.â The Interior
Department to-day received by mail a
communication from Indian. Agent Nick
erson of the Shoshone Agency, Wyo., re
porting that a faction of the Afapahoes
in the agency are idle, 'restless and de
fiant; that the agent is powerless to pre
vent them holding a sun dance in defiance
of his orders, and asking the War Depart
ment for the assistance of the troops at
Fort Washakie, . Wyo., to sustain the
agent. Â¦ Â¦ .
Acting Secretary Ryan later sent a re
quest to the War Department to have tne
troops at Fort Washakie, Wyo., assist the
agent at the Shoshone Reservation in
meeting any emergency in connection with
the threat of the Arapahoes. ;,
that an appropriation be made to pay same.
(Report of State Board 'of Examiners, dated
December 1, 1888, pages 4 et eeq.).
On February 26, 1901, an act was passed mak
ing an appropriation to pay tne deficiency for
transportation of insane and '. f eeble-mlnded
children for tho forty-ninth, fiftieth, nfty-nrst
and nfty-secqnd fiscal years, as approved by the
-State Board of Examiners.
Upon examination of these claims and com
parison with the amount? as they appear in the
report of the State Board of Examiners above
noted, I find that in each instance the amount
has been reducedâ the amount for which the
claim was approved having been mutilated or
erased and a less amount substituted. In my
opinion such a proeeeding is clearly Illegal.
(Cahill vs. Colgan, Vol. 4, California I>eclsions,
No. 23D). \ * _, t â¢
These claims havlnff been approved for a
stated amount by the State Board of Examiners
and having- been transmitted to the Legisla
ture for payment as provided by law and an
appropriation having been made by the Legis
lature in accordance with the report and ap
proved by the board, there Is no warrant of
law for a subsequent reduction of the approved
amount In other words, the amounts Â¦ as
shown by the report. of the Board of Examiners
are not subject to review.
Claim No. 4189 is signed by only one member
of the Board of Examiners. The omission of
the second signature is doubtless due to over
sight. .
Claims 2526 and 2867 were approved on^jJan
uary 18 and February 28, 1899, respectively, and
are included in the report and recommenda
tion of the Board of Examiners, dated Decem
ber 1, 19C0. - v ,
. In their present form I decline to draw my
Â¦warrant in payment of these claims. Very
truly yours, E. P. COLGAN, Controller.
Acts Without Authority.
Back of this letter and these claims Is
an episode which has furnished food for
gossip. The claim is made that at least
one member of the board who was readily
accessible (and probably two) was not
present at the time these claims were cut
down. In fact, the declaration is made
that there was no meeting of the board
on -the subject at all, and that whatever
cutting was done â and it was considerable,
as the appearance of the claims indicates
âwas done without proper authority by
Daniel Kevane, secretary of the board. .
Kevane, strictly speaking, is not a mem
ber of the Board of Examiners at all, the
board under the law consisting of the
Governor, Secretary, of State and Attor
ney General; but, in the absence of any
two of these members, the law authorizes
him to act. The law also empowers the
Assistant Attorney General to. act for his
superior. Assistant Attorney General
Po$t, who acts 'Â¦ for his superior regularly,
was asked this evening if he was present
at the meeting at which the alterations
in the claims were made.- - .
"I was not present," said Mr. Post,
"and I did not know there was such a
meeting 1 . I. have 'not been present at any
meeting at which the changing of those
bills was discussed."
Secretary of .State Curry was asked the
same question. He said he could not tell
until he saw the minutesâ that there were
so manjf different claims that he could
not tell as to whether he had- ever acted
on these until he looked the matter up.
Mr. Kevane, he said, was at present out
of town. He understood these bills were
cut down to conform with the
present schedule of charges for such ser
vices as the Sheriffs rendered.
The State Controller meets with general
support in his view that no one man and
no set of men have any authority to cut
down claims which have been audited and
duly passed by an -official body" and for
the payment cf which 'Â¦ the Legislature
has made a specific appropriation.

It is not anticipated that any further ap
peals will be taken. An adjustment' of the
claims of the respective parties will no doubt
follow and a lone and difficult IltUratlon will
then be ended. â¢
While the test cases were being carried to a
final determination a series of. new suits were
commenoed to save the rights of the, estate
with rer.oect to the taxes annually levied on
its property, and it is these latter cases that
have Just been decided by Judge Seawell.". Out
of the entire litigation the right of the city
and county to tax the bonds of foreign Â«corpo
ratlcne and the shares of 6tocks of foreign cor
porations may be said to have been firmly
established. With this litlcatlcn concluded I
understand that the entire estate of Mrs. Fair
will pass from the trustees to the heirs.
This series of decisions .marks the 'end of
lltigratlcn extending over' a period of several
years and involving the right of the city and
county to tax the bonds and- the shares of
stock of foreign .corporations. When. Theresa
Fair died In 1894 she left a large and very
valuable estate consisting- in part of bonds of
Eastern corporations. When the possession of
these bonds was disclosed by the filing of the
inventory of her estate the Assessor proceeded
to assess them In the next assessment roll.
Judge Seawell handed dqwn an opinion
yesterday in which he holds that stocks
and bonds of foreign corporations held by
residents of this State and located within
the State are taxable. This decision Is of
special importance to this city and county.
In the action instituted by Jane L. Stan
ford as executrix of the will of the late
Leland Stanford to recover $11,145 53 taxes
paid under protest on foreign stocks and
bonds judgment is ordered entered in fa
vor of the defendant. In the suit brought
by John W. Mackay and Richard V. I>ey
as trustees under the will . of the late
Theresa Fair to recover $30,262 the court
reaches ! a different and Interesting con
clusion, however. The court holds that,
'though the stocks and bonds, claimed by
them to be exempt from" taxation, are tax
able, as the residence of John W. Mackay;
one of the trustees, is outside of this
State, the one-half interest of Richard V.
Dey. the other trustee, who is a resident
of this State, is alone taxable within this
State, and hence judgment in favor of
John W. llackay as trustee for $15,131,
half the amount sued for, is ordered en
tered. As John W. Mackay is a resident
of Nevada, his half interest as trustee in
the stocks and bonds are, under this de
cision, properly assessable in Nevada.
Speaking about the case yesterday, City
Attorney Lane said:

j The Boerd of Public Works yesterday
awarded the contract for sweeping the
ftreet? In districts one and four to Gray
Broa. The City Street Improvement Com
pany's bid for sweeping- streets in districts
two and three and sprinkling streets em
braced in districts one and two was ac
cepted. The fact that the checks,accom
panying Gray Bros.' bids were not certi
fied was held by the board to be an imma
terial trror, which . was subsequently cor
rected. In the meantime the City Attor
ney will render an opinion relative to the
force of the charter provision which re
quires checks accompanying bids - to be
certified. -. .
Contracts for Street-Cleaning.
The communication demonstrates the
official red tape that must "be gone
through under the charter when school
buildings are in need of repairs. Under
the old order of things the Board of Edu
cation made necessary repairs on its own
account. Now the charter places the re-
Fl^nsibility partly on the Board of Works
*md partly on the Board of Education.
The inspector ascertains the need of any
ropairs and notifies the Board of Work3.
That board informs the Board of Educa
tion to that effect and it in turn investi
gates the necessity thereof. Thereupon
requisition is made upon the Board of
Works to make the repairs and after sev
orai weeks of delay they may be finally
begun. In the meantiKie the children In
the Mission . High S<5hool, according to
Commissioner Manson, are in danger of
their lives and many of them are not at
tending the school on that account.
Salary Schedule Completed.
The Board of Education completed the
readjustment of the salary roll, which was
adopted in the main on Monday last.- Di
rector Mark. and Superintendent .Webster
made an effort to have certain salaries
kept at the old figures, but without suc
cess. Mark wanted principals of grammar
schools of more than eighteen classes put
Vack to $200 per month, and Webster
pleaded that teachers of modern languages
be paid $125 per month, but Directors Kin
caid. Denman and Casserly refused to
change, their vote fixing grammar school
principals' salaries at $180 per month and
those of teachers of modern languages at
Sino. The salary of principals of primary
schools of twelve and thirteen classes was
placed at $130 per month; four to nine
classes at $120, and of one to three classes
5105. The Janitors of the Polytechnic,
Lowell High, Mission High. Girls 1 High
and Lincoln Grammar were fixed at $75,
tS6. $125. $140 and $150. respectively.
Assistant Secretary Charles Berliner
filed a statement showing the reductions
and Increases in the various salaries, for
which he received a compliment from the
directors. The statement shows that the
increase for 1S01-2 is $990 per month over
IS00-OL The number of teachers whose
salaries are Increased is 604, number, of
teachers and Janitors reduced, 41; net
number favored by increase, r.63. The sal
aries of fifty Seventh grade teachers were
raised from '$79 to $83. and 500 fifth and
r.ixth grade teachers from $79 to $80, in ac
cordance with the law. ',
Wants Playground Maintained.
The California Club notified the board
that it Is ready to resign the use and con
trol of the playground on Bush street.
between Hyde and Larkin, on account of
lack of co-operation. The club urged that
the playground be maintained by the
board.
The resignation of W. T. Plunkett as
teacher of the Lincoln Evening School was
accepted. Plunkett resigned because the
board would not grant him six months'
leave of absence.
Leaves of absence were granted to Lil
ian B. O'Neil and Esther Livingston.
Official Bed TapÂ© Causes Delay.
To risk the lives of children underneath It
is criminal. It is in such a condition that a
very 1 slight shock would throw the trusses
down and drop the heavy slate roof upon the
thin ceilings and partitions below, which are
of inadequate strength to stand any. such
ehock.
The Board of Education received a com
munication yesterday from Commissioner
Hanson of the Board of Public "Works
stating- that the lives of the pupils in the
Mission High School are endangered on
account of the condition of the roof of the
east end of the building. The communi
cation created something of a sensation,
and Directors Casserly and Denman were
delegated to make an Investigation. It
reads as follows:
The roof of the Mission High School was built
on radically defective plans, and In a very poor
manner. The main trusses have sagged both
vertically and horizontally, and many of the
posts- which should carry the roof above are
left swtnglnff without support.

How this subsidy works can easily be
seen in the case of the French bark Bour
baki. That vessel is now. in Limerick, Ire
land, but has been chartered .to. load
wheat at Portland, Or., ..for 40 shillings
per ton. She will make the'run to this
coast in , ballast, as there is no cargo of
fering, and even then will be able to pay
her owners- a big dividend if the round
trip is completed. A vessel of any other
nationality woiild . loose big money on
such a venture, 1 but the Bourbaki can af
ford to Hall 15,000 miles in ballast in order
to -secure a charter.. ,. â¢-.
For every knot a French ship sails the
Government ; pays her so much as a
Bubsldy to encourage the building up of
the French mercantile marine. A . f ew
years ago a French vessel was rarely
seen in this port; now there, are three
loading here,' half a dozen are ton their
way to Europe with California cargoes
and sixteen are coming here to load, and
this is all due to the subsidy.

While moving the steam schooner Aber
deen the tug Ida W was nearly sunk un
der the stern of the whaleback Titania.
The latter overhung the end of Missfon
street â¢wharf and 'was a menace to navi
gation. The tug Sea King lay along the
end of the wharf and she also was in the
way. As the Ida W was backing out with
her tow the flood tide caught her and car
ried her down on the Sea King. After
colliding with Ihe latter vessel she drifted
down under the stern of the big collier
and nearly lost her deckhouse and smoke
stack. As it was, the deckhouse was shift
ed and the â¢ suys of the smokestack
snapped. The deck hand Â¦ fled from the
pilot-house and Captain Dan James had
to rush and take his place. .The fireman
came on deck in a hurry, but Chief En
gineer Poole stuck to his post. The mud
dle was straightened out finally, but the
Ida W is on the drydock for repairs.

The twenty Japanese stowaways who
came here on the America Maru made a
desperate attempt at escape last night.
They succeeded in some man

watchmen. The latter cowed the Japs
with their revolvers and held them until
help came, when' they were locked up
again.

Captain Swan of the British ship Port
Crawford had a mixture of bad and good
luck yesterday. He had considerable
trouble In receiving a crew, but finally
succeeded in filling his list Tuesday even
ing and was to .have > sailed ' yesterday
morning . for . Europe. -When it came "to
heaving up the anchor it would not budge,
and in consequence the vessel lost the
tide. The tug Relief was ready to \ tow
"the ship to sea and she made fast to the
anchor and finally got it started. When
hauled in it was found that about two
tons of anchor and chain were fast to the
Port Crawford's mud i hook. When this
mass of iron is sold it will net the ship
more than $800. The Port Crawford Is

the Commissioners asking that the elec

Kilburn. Later it was announced that the
commission was in favor of making the
display permanent. . ;

Its Intention of building the; three floating
docks If the commission would supply the
necessary -wharf . room the matter was
taken under consideration. Â¦ The bulk of
the board's Income Is - pledged for some
time to come,' so it was decided that If the
contractor who got the job would take
part payment In cash and the balance in
warrants extending over ; one, two, three
and four years the Commissioners .would
go on with the work. .At Â¦ yesterday.' s
meeting of the board the drydock . com
pany announced that contractors would
bid on the I work on the board's terms.
Commissioner Herold then moved that
the chief engineer prepare plans and esti
mates for the necessary wharves,- which
will be built near -the Arctic Oil Works.
The motion was carried and the work will
proceed as soon as the preliminaries are
completed. ' . Â¦ . -I Â¦ -' Â¦ _'Â¦Â¦

The Panama Railroad Company asked
for a permanent wharf for its steamships,
and suggested Harrison-street pier. The
matter was referred to Commissioner Her
old and Chief Wharfinger Henderson.
The Commissioners passed a resolution
yesterdky which will compel all 'gasoline
launches and schooners to fill their tanks
at a wharf remote from the principal
piers. Charles Pratt of the Arctic . Oil
Works announced that his company was
laying a pipeline to the outer end of its
wharf and that all vessels using gasoline
would be supplied there by meter,, thus
doing away with the use of oil drums.
When Commissioner Klrkpatrick first
took his seat in the board he suggested
that the State piledriver be no longer
used and that the work done by it be let
by contract. After 1 some discussion It
was decided to try the experiment for
three months. Yesterday bids were opened
for the work, and S; D. Lecalre's offer of
$3 for piles and $5 per 1000 feet for lumber
was accepted. The contractor is to have
the use of the State's piledriver and tools

An Illinois man, sentenced to an inebriate asylum,

There is needed no argument in a matter of this
kind. The suggestion appeals directly to the hear,t as
well as to the brain. â¢ For many a year, now the whole
English-speaking race has .been responsive to the
words of Sir Samuel Fergusson:'
Give honor to their memories who left the pleasant land
To shed their blood so freely for the love of fatherland;
Who left their chance of quiet ase and grassy church
yard graves
So freely for a restless bed amid the tossing waves. ,
Sailors and. soldiers fought alike for the nation and
have an equal honor in the hearts of the people. Ever
since the great Civil War we have annually decorated
the graves of those who rest beneath the soil of the
land tl%y loved, but it has been hitherto deemed im
possible* to so decorate the last resting place of those
whom the ocean holds in its deeps. That impossibility
is overcome by the poetic inspiration of the patriot
woman, and now we have only to follow it to give to
our Decoration day a new beauty, a new ceremony of
deep significance, and to remind the youth of the.
republic of the. valor of those who upheld the flag
amid the storms and battles of the sea.
The suggestion has been submitted to many men of
high official station and has received their prompt and
cordial approval. In this city, at any rate, its adoption
will not be difficult,* for the sea is all around us, and
at the Presidio it is easy of access under conditions
befitting such a ceremony as is proposed. Moreover,
from the warships and other vessels in the harbor it
will be facile as \xt\\ as a graceful. thing to scatter
flowers over the surface of the great cemetery of
the sea.
tt^ROM Mrs. Armitage S. C Forbes there has
r~< qpme a suggestion concerning the ceremonies of
â¢*â¢ Decoration day so patriotic in motive and so
poetic in spirit that it is certain to meet with a respon
sive chord in every American heart. The suggestion,
which was elaborately reviewed in the local columns
of The Call yesterday, is that in the solemn services
of the day we should cQmrtiemorate not only those
heroic men who died on land for the Union, but those
whose graves are in the sea, and that while so many
flowers are strewn upon the mounds of the graveyards
some should be cast upon the waves in memoty of
those who Jie beneath the waters'. ' . ,

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
It is a goodthing for the world: that .the long
suffering musicians of the American Federation have
at last revolted" and have started a' crusade for the
protection of American ears, and American taste.
There may be no way to kill the amateur ragtime
man, any more than there is a way of killing the cats
that sing cat-time music in the back yard, but he may
be largely suppressed.. If the professional musicians
will stand by the resolutions adopted at the Denver
convention they will deserve the gratitude of their
fellow citizens. . ...
There is nothing original about ragtime except the
iniquity of it.' Similar effects have occasionally been
used in music from time' immemorial, and when used
sparingly and withgood taste the syncopations added
a grace to music/ Â¦' When' the practice was 'overdone,
4 and what is called ragtime was produced, the muse of
melody and of harmony shrieked and fled- . There was
no longer any music remaining, but only a - concate
nation of sounds that tickled the 'ears of unmusical
people! It was perpetrating upon music much the
same outrage that was perpetrated upon literature by
the dialect story,, and was even more inexcusable. |
The language of the resolution is not altogether
commendable; but in a case of this kind no good man
will find fault with the manner in which the condem
nation is j pronounced. As , William Lloyd -Garrison
said he. would not trouble himself to try to be moder
ate in dealing with slavery, so the; musicians of: the
United States may justlyclaim that in'dealihg with the
abomination of ragtime it is not necessary, to be nice
in the. selection of epithets.\ There is no polite word
that fitly characterizes ragtime, and so it might ju'st'as
well be called "rot" as anything else.

There is an excellent chance that the Congressional
Committee Â«bri' Rivers and Harbors 'will pay us a visit
to inspect our waterways. - The committee may. be
assured that it 'will see much which is eminently worth
seeing and much which should receive the heartiest
support and encouragement of the national'Govern
ment. . Â¦ V â¢ . â¢ .. ..

be seen that the reform is in the interest of
the borrower. It is intended to give him- a more eco
nomical use of his credit, and to equalize conditions of
credit between the business center and circumference
of the country..
It is believed by the committee and by financiers
that when this conservative measure is put in opera
tion-it will so commend itself to, the business com
munity, which is the borrowing community, that
further steps in banking reform will be easy.
At that datt the banks had in circulation only $309,
640,443. The Secretary of the Treasury declared that
under the existing law and this discrepancy between
capital and circulation if is clear "that our currency
-System, under which the volume of circulating medi
um is more responsive to the market price of Govern
ment bonds than to the requirements of trade and
industry, is not yet satisfactpry." v "
THE country is familiar with the benefits of the
gold standard legislation. It has protected^ the
.general credits of the country against the two'
sources from which they always suffered injury.*. One
of these was the decline in speculative credits, due to
such scenes as were recently witnessed on Wall street. ,
Speculation in the paper representatives of property,
when' carried to such lengths as to break into wild
fluctuations, has always .heretofore infected commer
cial credits, with panic and produced widespread dis
aster. Since the gold standard was definitely adopted
there have been two sharp and alarming epidemics of
stock speculation, with no effect at all' upon commer
cial credits. ' ' '- ' â¢.>:% . -
The other source of danger hasahvays been fluctua
tion in the iron market. Whether it is a business su
perstition or a reality, it has always been held that
sharp decline in the iron trade must damage commer-';
cial credit, and as that effect always followed that
cause, panic was always j expected from ' such condi
tions in the metal trade. 'Â¦_Â¦_ - Â¦'Â¦ Â¦. â¢
Since the gold standard was adopted there occurred
a decisive decline in iron, and credit and general com
merce were totally unaffected rby.it., The business
world is not unmindful of these things, and sees in
them the wisdom of the policy of the Indianapolis
Monetary Conference, which has urged and promoted .
this legislation.
This should give the business community confidence
in the further purposes of the executive committee of
that. conference, and should procure for the committee
the financial assistance which it will require foÂ» the
completion of its work. '. "-
That committee will'urge Congress at its next.ses
sion to pass a bill that inaugurates bank reform in a
conservative way. As we have, often demonstrated, a
banking system is needed that will distribute the sur
plus capital, which is the loan fund of the country, -
more equally than is possible now. At present. s^uch
capital congests in the money centers, lowering inter
est there,, and, by creating stringency remote from
such centers, raising interest at a distance and produc
ing a distressing, inequality.
The committee carried this matter into the Repub
lican National Convention last year and secured the
adoption of the following in the party platform: "We
recognize that interest rates are a potent factor in pro
duction and business activity, and, for the purpose of
further equalizing and of further lowering the rates of
interest, we favor such monetary legislation as will
enable the varying needs, of the seasons and of all sec
tions to be. promptly met, in order that trade may be
evenly sustained, labor steadily employed and com
merce enlarged."
In his annual' message last December President Me-.
Kinley called attention to this pledge, saying: "The
partyHn power is committed to such legislation as will
better make the currency responsive to the varying
needs of business at all seasons and in all sections."
A bill was introduced in the House last winter by
Mr. Lovering to provide the conservative elasticity of
the banking currency which will 'redeem that pledge.
It authorizes the issue by national banks of credit
notes up to le^per cent of. the capital of the bank,
guarded by a. gold guaranty fund. This fund is main
tained by all the banks and is in the custody of the
Treasury, so that the credit notes of any bank that
becomes insolvent are protected in the hands of the
holder, just as, the national bank notes are now by the"
bonds held by the Treasury.* "^yj
The amount of such safe and elastic currency issu
able will not be so large as to endanger inflation. On
the 30th of last June the total capital of the national
banks was $627,503,095. A 10 per cent issue on that
total would amount to $62,750,309.

When- the Old Man Marries.
Throwing Off Cares' of Business.
If one has been diligently pursing any
line of business, aa he enters ,upon old
age, let him sfmply diminish the number
of hours of active work and intrust more
tt> others, -while he rests or -rides in the
open air, or stores .his mind with a Knowl
edge of the. affairs of his. owiT and -other
countries from the 'columns of -bis dally
paper. If his business is in the crowded
city, Â¦ with . its , dust â¢ and smoke and foul
air. let him early 1 select , on the nearest
shady hillside or by lake or eea, just-acre3
enough for a summer home, with shaded
walks, shrubs and flowers and -& garden
of fresh vegetables and fruit, where his
familv may spend the hot months of sum
mer, "and to which he may flee as the
evening approaches each day, ana spend
the night and early morning with them.
And when old age has so far advanced
that he can no longer give personal atten
tion to business he can find t no better
earthly paradise than -this. Â«
'- If his business has, been that of farming
and he Is, of course, accustomed to coun
try air, physical labor, and the mental
vigilance necessary to make his business
successful, when. he begins to feel the
weariness of old age, let him not com
mit the very common mistake of surren
dering all his land and taking a residence
in a crowded city or a densely populated
village, thereby making a total - change
both in habits of life and surroundings.
Better far for such to change from
their broad acres only to a suitable resi
dence to which is attached, just land,
enough to support a cow, a horse, pig ana
chickens, with a good vegetable and fruit
garden. Here they would have fresft
country air and merely enough of the la
bor to which they have been accustomed
to prevent time from hanging heavily on
their hands, and still to afford them
abundance of leisure time for reading and
acts of benevolence,, together with social
and religious duties.
ests as need the help of all. good citizens,
old age will generally .be long, peaceful
and useful. But if the first, and second
periods of .'life have been dominated ,by
unrestrained selfishness," whether, in grat-,
lfylng personal appetites and passions or
simply in accumulating wealth, the period
of. 'old "age -will: be short and, filled with
anxiety and wain regrets. It Is evident,
therefore, that the first step toward using
old age to the, best advantage consists in
having used the preceding periods of life
in: accordance with- the, best Ideals or
good, active citizenship.- If the individual
has done this aa a mere laboring manor
woman and the day3= oÂ£ diminLihert
strength and activity have come, let that
person at once seek lighter kinds of la
bor or less hours for the day, and cheer
fully accept correspondingly less pay. By
so doing one will continue to earn some
thing to the latest period possible and will
prevent the ennui of idleness and. the con
scious depression of helplessness or want.
PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS
The beginning of old age is , not marked
by the passing of any uniform . number of
years of life. , Many, persons. present more
of the attributes "ofNold "age; at fifty than
some others do' at severity .years. 1 Human
life naturally consists of .three periods-rone
of growth, called childhood and youth;* one
of maturity or adult age, when both mental
and physical activity and Â¦endurance are
most I efficient, I and | one ; of decline â¢ or old
ag-e. -The first is pre-eminently the period
of adaptation - or >. adjustment to Its Â¦ sur
roundings j or 'environment; ;,ths ' second is
( one of comparative stability and efficiency
in the prosecution of some '.chosen line of
work; while .the third .has capacity
f or . adjustment" to . new^ environments or
hew lines of labor, and is prone -to cling
to previous habits or lines^ of work, j with
annually.' decreasing efficiency ; until com-'
pelled. 'to cease." "
The. circumstances that favor the attain
ment of old-age are the inheritance of a
good type of . organization or tenacity : of
life from -healthy,' long-lived parentage;
the eating of only a fair variety of whole
some food;-the constant use of fresh, pure
air; moderate outdoor exercise daily, and
total abstinence from. 1 the use, of narcotic,
anesthetic or intoxicating drinks Â¦ of every
kind. Â¦ Â¦: -, . . ;;Â¦..-,-- â ...:Â¦
; In * addition . to : the foregoing, the period
of youth should be accompanied ;by such
educational training as will favor an equal
and full development of., the i various or

faculties of the mind, .both moral and:in
tellectual, but without extremes of. either
physical exertion or intensity of * mental
application.-". - -.. ' * : - . â¢ . '-.

': Characteristics of Old Age. ' '
-The chief characteristics of old age are.
less mental activity and less retentivenes3
of -memory, regarding recent events: less
erect . position and. less cteadiness of step
In ---.walking;-, slower .circulation : of the
blocd; less depth of breaching, and a tend
ency to- become much -more quickly fa
tigued by either physical or mental- labor.
The diminished activity of circulation. and
respiration, due in part to ossification of
the cartilages ;of the' ribs,' causes the
amount of oxygen 'furnished- to the blood
and : of waste carbon liberated through the
air-cells cf the lungs to be diminished.
This â¢ lessens . the activity of the processes
of nutrition and secretion and favors a
slow impairment or . degeneration of the
muscular structures; especially of the
heart and arteries.' They thus become pro
gressively .weaker, until they are no longer
capable of- continuing the circulation, and
the individual dies from passive accumu
lation of bloodx in - the ; capillaries of the
brain or lungs, or.iby failure of the .heart

Such being the nature and tendencies of
genuine old-age, the question how to use
it to the -best advantage Is one of -much
interest and importance. In answering it,
it is necessary to keep in mind the distinc
tion between . simple- old age < as just de
scribed and. the cases of premature failure
''of life, - often in -thev middle of the adult
Â¦period, froirt\chronic diseases produced by
injurious occupations and. habits or. modes
of 'living. Such, cases are numerous inall
classes of society and are often designated
as examples ; of . premature old age. . The

These remarks - regarding the use of.

vigor of . adult activity,* apply, with even
greater . propriety *" to the treatment 'of
cases of genuine old age. , Through all the
ages of the- past- philosophers and .doc

in searching for an elixir of life, by the
use of which . youthful . activity ! and adult

nought, -like those of Paracelsus, the
prince of charlatans of the sixteenth cen
tury ;A.:.-D.,-who died with his much
vaunted "elixir of life'.' in his ppeket at
the early age of 48 years. . s . .

Ihere is another important class of busi
ness i men whose Â¦ chief Â¦â¢ aim durinsr their
years of activity appears to be simply the
accumulation -of sufficient - wealth to en
able.theni^on'the approach of. old age, to
retire altogether from their accustomed
business and to . spend their declining
years inabsolute leisure, that they may,
like -the. foolish rich man in the parable,"
"eat, -drink and -be, merry." Those -who
succeed in getting their "barns and store
houses? 'filled and suddenly
commence their period of expected ease
are generally .the most unhappy and
short-lived of all : the aged persons- we
meet: After many years of daily mental
activity- and :, physical ; exercise they sud-.
denly find themselves wlthout'either. Con
sequently some of them endeavor to fill'
the j vacant , hours . in their social . clubs,
where newspapers,- idle gossip, cigars and
anesthetic drinks help to make them ob
livious to the passing time, while at the
same time they hasten the failures of cir
culation," respiration and -nerve force, and
cause, death to overtake the individual
when I least ( expected. Others readily - ac
cept the invitations of, their families or
friends to join'* them in â¢ excursions to
South America. Europe, Asia or round the
world,- and- soon- succumb to. the fatlgufe
of sightseeing, irregular -hours . of. eating
and sleeping and vain efforts to keep pace
with younger, travelers, as has been al
ready, described. ' .; Â¦ ., i. .
- lEase That Brings TJnhappiness.
But the most unhappy of all those who
have suddenly retircJ from some strictly
money-ieaking business are persons with
only, limited education "and equally lim
ited attention to public affairs,- wth fewer
familiar assocates and no thought of for
eign travel." In this group are found some
who 'have been livery, and stage coach
men, -successful contractors, some mer
chants and not a few industrious farmers.
Having by active industry and rigid econ
omy-accumulated an abundance for their
support through old age, they yield to the
sug-g-estion of . friends or interested mem
bers of their families and dispose of their
business, with the confident expectaton
of rest for both body, and mind for the re
mainder of life. But the sudden stopping
of their previous daily routine of thought
and activity, without any substitute capa
ble of attracting their attenon and en
grossing at least a part of their time, their
expected rest' becomes extreme restless
ness. Â¦ For the mind accustomed to a daily
routine of thought and accretion for twen
ty-five qr thirty years, abruptly deprived
of that routine and left vacant.- first be
comes restless, then gloomy or despond
ent,-and finally demented, with the fixed
idea, that the individual Is on the. verge
of poverty or of becoming a grievous bur
den to family or friends.. Wearied with
such forebodings, many of them commit
suicide, and others end their days in hos-"
pitals for the insane. â¢â¢Â»
. ~ Useful and Cheerful Old Age.
From the foregoing statements it is ob
vious -that all persons .who spend the
strength and energy. of their adult years
for the_, sole u purpose of , accumulating
wealth or, for selfish display find it very
difficult to make their old age either long
or-enjoyable. On the contrary, those who"
have diligently .- prosecuted , their * various
lines of work, not so much for the selfish
purposes of accumulation or estentatious
display as for obtaining means for aiding
the -important educational,, religious and
charitable Interests ever present/in civil
ized communities,' and have thereby be
come interested in both I the public wel
fare and the relief of individuals in need,
seldom if ever find old age a period of
mental. vacuity or barren of. peaceful en
joyment., If during their years of efficient
activity they.- have -succeeded, in not only
receiving enough . for their > own support
and to . give a fair degree of help to the
needy -around them, but a surplus for
their declining years, they, unconsciously
perhaps, welcome the leisure hours of age
as affording them the opportunity' they
had desired for more judiciously dispens
ing aid. to the individuals andÂ»instltutions
needing It. If it should so happen, that the
old man's liberality to others during his
years of activity had been such that he
had reserved no surplus for his declining
years,. still -the memory of his past good
deeds and the cordial greeting. of lifelong
friends would add comfort : and - content
ment* to his latest days, 1 ; though they
might be extended to a hundr&cLyears.
. ;It;is thus seen. that^both the duration
and the .usefulness of old age depend very
much upon the manner.in which. the pre
ceding periods of life have been spent. If
the moral and Intellectual faculties I have'
been ;.. developed, : disciplined and - stored
with knowldege during youth and if the
years of adult activity and vigor, have
been spent not only In the diligent prose
cution of some legitimate and useful line
of work,, but also in ' lending a helping
Â¦hand to all such public arid private inter-

' Superintendent Wright Is the oldest su
* perintendent In point of service connected
with the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany. He began the railroading business
in 1871 as a brakeman on a freight train
running to Nevada. He was advanced to
the position of conductor of. a freight
train and later on to the post of conductor
â¢ on a passenger train. His run for. a time
was between Stockton and San Francisco,
and later between San Francisco and Sac
ramento. In 1878 he was appointed super
intendent of the Sacramento Valley Rail
road, known as the Placerville road, and
held that position until 1882, when he was
appointed superintendent Â¦ of (Sacra
mento division. He. has remained in that
K position up to the present. Colonel Wright
was regarded by all railroad men in this
section as their friend, and he was very
: popular with them. It was always un
derstood by them, that whatever, griev
ances they had Wright would always ac
cord them fair play. During^ the mem

Eleanor Martin filed suit yesterday

that she must pay her taxes. Some
months ago Mrs. Sargent instituted an ac
tion against the city and county to re
cover taxes paid under protest, the pro
ttst being in substance that as she Â¦was
denied the rigtit of suffrage and a voice
in the conventions of the people she
should not be compelled to pay taxes upon
property standing in her name and owned
exclusively by her. The court then held
i hat Mrs. Sargent must litigate, her case
not. through a suit to recover taxes but in
an action in mandamus to compel the
Board of Election Commissioners to place
l:er name upon the register of voters..
Mrs. Sargent followed the suggestion of
the court and filed a petition for a writ of
inundate for the purpose named. This ac
tion was heard and argued before Judge
Slcss, v.'ho handed duwn an opinion yes
terday. which, so far as the Superior
Court is concerned, finally disposes .of
both the tax and mandamus cases and
adversely to Mrs. Sargent.
In his opinion Judge Sloss says in part:
At the outset it may ba remarked that the
<rjtsUcn before the court is purely one of law.
The only matter to be considered is whether
or not under the law < constitutional or other)
in force in this State the right to vote can be
denied to Â¦womrn. Considerations of propriety
cr of ex:Â»ediency or of abstract Jus
tice have no place in thls\ discus
rlon, except in so far as they may
aid in the interpretation of doubtful or am
l.iuuous brovisions in the law.
The uower of each State to determine the
rlass of inhabitants who may vote within her
limits is declared by the Supreme Court of
;his State. The power of the State to impose
as a condition of the franchise. Qualifications
cf property or of ate or of education or of
rrsider.ee has never been claimed to affect the
I'ower to impose the burden of taxation upon
the property of thof=e denied the right of vot
ing by reason of inability to comply with' any
of such Qualifications. It follows, therefore,
that the contention that taxation of a per
eon's property necessarily confers upon that
penson the right to vote cannot be sustained.
For the foregoing reasons both the complaint
In the action to recover taxes and the applica
tion for a writ of mandate fail to state facts
Fufflclent to constitute a cause of action.
I><?murrers to both complaints will be sus
tained, without leave to amend.
Mrs. Ellen C. Sargent has been denied
the right to vote; the court has also held
Register.

Mr. McKenzie was too sick i to leave the

OAKLAND, May 22.â Warren S. Pal
mer said to-night that he had received no
notification either from headquarters or
indirectly that he was to be made super
intendent of the Sacramento division of
the Southern Paoiflc to succeed J. B.
Wright. In view of that fact he declined
to^ discuss the matter.,
SACRAMENTO, May 22.â Division Su-.
perintendent J. B; Wright ' arrived >tb
night from San Francisco. He was asked
for a statement with reference to his res-
ia result Wright's resignation was asked
for through Manager Flllmorey Â¦
WRIGHT IS SILENT.
SUPERINTENDENT OF WESTERN DIVISION OF THE SOUTHERN- PA- ,_
CIFIC WHO IS TO RETIRE AT THE REQUEST OF PRESIDENT HAYS
AND THE MAN WHO IS TO SUCCEED HIM AT SACRAMENTO.
JB. WRIGHT of Sacramento, one
of the oldest and best known
railroad men in the State, is no
3 longer connected with the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company.
His resignation is in the hands of General
Manager Kruttschnitt. W. S. Palmer, at
present assistant superintendent of the
Western division of the company,
with headquarters at Oakland, will
succeed Wright . as superintendent of
the Sacramento division. The re
tirement of Wright came as a
great surprise, for it was generally
believed that his position was secure and
that no matter what changes might follow
the coming of President Hays Wright
would not be disturbed. The removal of
Wrightâ for removal it amounts to, his
resignation having b>3en asked for by
Manager^Flllmore at the request of Presi
dent Haysâ has caused a- feeling of un
i easiness in the "yellow building." While
it Is stated on apparently authentic in
formation that no further changes are
contemplated at present, many of the old
employes are anxious and fear that any
day they may be also asked to resign.
. While the railroad officials are reticent
as to the causes leading up to the retire
ment of Wright, it is generally believed
that President Hays- concluded that he
was devoting mere time to his private in
terests than he was to the business of the
railroad. For the past nineteen years
Wright has had full control of the Sacra
mento division of the road, with headquar
ters at Sacramento, and he has been a
potent power In politics. Much of his
time was given to political work in the
interest of the company and he was re
garded as one . of the Sacramento
"bosses." President Hays does not be
lieve In railroad politics, and Wright was
given so to understand, but he did not
accept the hint. He is also largely'Inter
ested in oil speculation and his properties
have taken up much of his "time. These
matters displeased President Hays and as

Heartand Kidney Diseases
Owing to the gTeat prevalence of KID-
NEY diseases and the late discovery that
URIC ACID, a blood poison, is the cause
ot irany diseases, DR. ICAST has estab-
lished a CHEMICAL and MICROSCOP-
ICAL LABORATOHY. fitted up frith the
same instruments and appliances used . in
the gTeat laboratoriep of Europe for the
ANALYSIS OF LLOOD AND URINE.
This is, the only positive and scientific
method cf knowing- whether a KIDI>EY
disease is present. URIC ACID POISON
produces in some raf-ntal or nervous gymp-
toms, such as a confused and dazed mind,
attacks of the bluss, fiplittlng headaches,
loss of eelf-rtliance. the memory gets poor
or the temper bad. fretful, irritable;
while in others the URIC ACID is pre-
c'.oitated in the joints and muscles, pro-
ducing RHEUMATISM or GOUT. It fre-
quently causes neuralgias bladder troubles,
sexual disturbances, dyspepsia, palpitation,
arthrr.a. and Eisie forms of HEART dis-
ease. There Is no question that much un-
necessary PURGEHY might be avoided if
it were lfnown that many disorders of
menstruation, ovaritis, pelvic neuralgias
end kindred diseasci? of women owe their
origin to excees cf URIC ACID in the
blood.

NETCT TORK, May 22.â The stock market fell
rtia further Into apathy to-day and was only
relieved from seml-stagmatlon by the move
ment In the Erie stocks. Considering the pres
ent indifference of the speculative public to the
market, the volume of transactions In Erie
mutt be accepted as significant The profes
sional U-aders. at a loss to secure even a frac
tional profit on a turn In. the market, flocked
to the Erie crowd as the movement progressed
and added their speculative operations - to the
ether buying of the stock. The opinion, how
ever, trained force on . the exchange that the
movement marked a resumption of operation
for the extension of influence and control of ex
isting railroad systems. The buying was at
tributed to Wabash interests, and there were
sundry circumstances which offered . some cor
roboration. Statements were published " this
morning to the effect that a controling In
terest had been secured in Lacka wanna In
order to afford an outlet to the seaboard for
the Wabaeh and the Gould Southwestern sys
tem. This evidently -presented an effort to
account for the recent strength of Wabash and
its Southwestern affiliations in the face of the
disapolntment over the non-declaration of a
dividend an Missouri Pacific. It has been stated
with particularity for several* days past that
the buying of Toledo, St. Louis and Western
was for Vanderbilt account, and it wae de
clared to-day that control has passed. -It is
to be considered that these roads run over
closely related territory, and the activity in
their clocks favors the presumption that the
problem of their future relations and control
if being- worked out. The strength of Chicago,
Indianapolis and Louisville and of -the Chicago
Great Western Flocks may have had a bearing
on the same problem. The strength of ' the
bituminous coal ! earning roads was directly
attributable to the declaration of a dividend
of 1*4 per cent on the common stock of Hock
ing Valley, the first in its history. The Wheel
ing and Lake Erie stocks, Norfolk and West
ern and Chesapeake and Ohio all moved up
ward in sympathy. The strength of Readings
Â¦wan called in sympathy with Erie in its char
nr-ler as an anthracite carrier, but Erie was
the only one of the group to maintain its ad
vance. This Etock closed at the highest at a
Kain of 2%. Some of the individual blocks
purchased ran as high as 0000 shares. A feat
ure of the day was a sale of Northern Pacific
et 1T1, compared with 156% . last "night, but
the etock droped bpack again to 1C0. An un
plfesant impression was produced by a sug
gestion that the authorities of the London
Ptork Exchange would resÂ«clnd the suspension
of rules for buying in of Northern Pacific
*tock againrt the shorts. At the last settle
ment, it will be remembered, the difference
on this account was adjusted by allowing the
Fhortf to carry over at a fixed price. - But thit
Jrft their contracts rtill -uncovered and < th*"
4*iylng in of shorts for the next settlement,
which occurs next week, would be the occa
sion for renewed uneasiness. This suggestion
and (he announcement of $3)0.000 exported gold
J>s<5 a part in the early heaviness of the mar
fcet. The fact that there were no additional
gold engagements, contrary to expectation,
may have had pome influence In the later
hardening of prices, but the vigorous advance
in Erie was the main factor. A number of
minor industrial stocks were strong on very
palpable manipulation. In the general ltet
changes are email and somewhat mixed. . '

CHICAGO, May 22.â On improved j advices
from Liverpool , July wheat opened unchanged
to %c higher at 73%Â©73%c and immediately a
profit-taking movement was begun\by the iull
crowd, and this, aided : by reports of needed
rains In the West and Northwest, caused . a
decline to 72%c. Trade was active and-offer
ings were plentiful. Later in the j session the
crowd that had 1 been selling began: buying back
their lines on the ' strength ' of / a rumored ex
port demand and a reaction to 73% c' followed.
Under profit-taking the price again' dropped to
72%@73c. recovering' later anfl closing steady
and %c higher at 73%c. . ...
The corn market was fairly active and was
shaped by heavy receipts and a high Â¦ percent
age of contract grade, the bull leaders on both
sides of the market selling early and buying
back later in the session. July closed ' steady,
%@%c lower, at 44%c. May closed weak and

market was neglected and there was little
trading in that Most of the buying was for in
vestment account. Â¦ July pork closed 20@22%c
lower and lard and ribs each 5c lower..

The body of a female infant packed in
a paper box was found last night In the
vestibule of St. Peter and St Paul's Ital
ian Church, at tho corner of Dupont and
Filbert streets.
When the sexton, George Lagomarslno,
started to close the front doors of the
church his attention was attracted by a
box over which he stumbled. He lifted
it, and, on opening It, was startled to
find the puny body of a dead Infant. The
Coroner's office was at once notified and
an investigation begun. The child was
fully developed, and from all appearances
lived some time after birth. .
The autopsy, which will be performed
to-day, will settle this question and de
termine whether murder hÂ»s been com
mitted. The police were notified and will
make an effort to discover the Identity of
the parents of the dead babe.

was a cornerstone laying and a tree plant
ing. The cornerstone of Lisser Music Hall
was affixed in Its future resting place by
Miss Hazel Moore Patterson, a student of

to the building fund. The tree was start
ed on its upward career by the first grad
uates of the new century.
The assembly hall was crowded when
the commencement exercises began,
though the excellent arrangements made
everybody comfortable. The three gradu
ate*, of the college occupied front seats on
the platform and wore the mortar-board
and gown. The fifteen graduates of the
seminary took seats in the rear of the
stage. and looked very pretty in their
white chiffon dresses. Mrs. Mills, Pro
fessor Edwards of the State University
and the Rev. Ernest Baker of the First
Presbyterian Church of Oakland were also
on the stage. â¢
After a hymn sung by the undergradu
ates, prayer was offered by the Rev. Dr.
Moore, the prayer being followed by an
other chorus song. Tho Rev. Dr. Baker
delivered an address on "The Literary
Giants of the Nineteenth Qentury." He re
viewed the accomplishments of the* great
Intellectual minds of the last century and
discussed In brief Goethe, Coleridge, Ten
nyson and Carlyle.
The presentation of diplomas nnd de
grees followed, and as each young lady
stepped forward to receive the parch
ment from the hands of Mrs. Mills a vol
ley of applauxo greeted her. Miss Bertha
Wallace watt the lucky eiioaylst of tho
college, and she was awarded a prize of
recognition.

also the first of the century. With all our
hearts we bid you God speed as we send

Is we know not, 'but we are sure that
there is work for all of you. There will
be temptations and trials, but strength
according to your needs is promised you.
You can meet duty with a confidence
which will inspire you to still more dim

"From my hands you are to receive the
testimonials of our approval of your
work, and I hope, my beloved daughters,
that It may be said of every one of you
as she meets her Pilot face to face, 'Well
done, good and faithful servant, enter
thou Into the Joy of the Lord.' "
â¢ At the close of the exercises the people

A woman's college would fail of Its object
If It did not train the musical talente of
our daughters. We believe that In build

intendent not only because of his honor
able service during the Spanish war but
also because of his tttness for the office,

and po became unpopular with the cadets.
A high authority at the department stated
emphatically to-day that Colonel Mills
will be sustained in any proper measure
he may take to preserve discipline and
that no insubordination on the part of
cadets would be countenanced for a mo
ment.
The order of dismissal is signed by Sec
retary* Hoot, and states that it is issued
"by direction of the i'resldont upon rec
ommendation of the superintendent of the
military academy." 'ine name language

It is a wonderful soap
that takes hold quick and
does no harm.
No harm ! It leaves the
skin soft like a baby's; 7 no
alkali in it, nothing" but
soap. The harm is done bv
alkali. Still more harm is
done by not washing*. So,
bad soap is better than
none.
What is bad soap? Im-

i W. J. Leonard fought twice, registering
two victories, and the same thing hap
pened to Danny Danziger, so these two
men are "like to meet again."
Leonard defeated Joseph Neil, unat
tached, in the first round. Joseph showed
too much liking for the floor and rested
there some seconds too long. .Leonard met
J. Lundie, O. C. later on and gained a
decision over ' him. Danziger received a
decision over E. Derby after an extra
round was fought and later one over
James Howard. .
Greggains piloted a lucky string until
E. Parker of Sixth street met Joe Hag
gerty of nowhere. Haggerty made Par
ker think he was an angel for ten sec
onds. They packed Parker to his corner
In the second round. Â¦ >
The other fights ended: ... ,
Joseph Haggerty defeated Tommy Tay
lor, who -was all . but out â¢ in the second
round, and the seconds threw a white
towel in the ring. E. Parker ended Henry
Martin In a round. James Pallas got the
decision over J. Sternitzky. Sam Berger
lost to, Harry Foley on a decision. W.
Kelly and Joseph Doyle, after going four
rounds of heavy scienceless boxing, were
told the former was the better. James
Howard ended James Torre In a round
and then the latter developed something
cold around the sole.
The tournament will be concluded this
evening. - - ;
This Is how it all happened: Sam Berger,
â¢who is an Olympic Club man. crossed mitts
with Harry Foley of the Ariel Rowing
Club in a pretty three-round contest,
which was evenly waged, with the ad
vantage perhaps in Berger's favor. - The
judges, Miltcn Hayes and W. AL Cart
wright, were divided In their opinions, so
by the rules in use the duty of deciding
the bout devolved upon the referee. Smith
settled upon Foley as the winner. Imme
diately a howl went up from the benches
on which were seated a great majority of
Olympic Club men. Â¦
Grcer Harrison, surrounded by the di
rectors of the club, all holding their
thumbs awry, went into hasty ponsulta-,
tion. Hardly had the hisses abated when
thÂ« president rose to his feet and with a
wave of his hand stilled the noisy, sibilant
multitude. "The directors of .the Olympic
Club will give Berger a medal," said the
president. Then the populace cheered
and J. B. Smith left the ring.
It was a direct solar plexus and chin
blow combined to the referee. He recog
nized it and said: "No more for me."
Smith got his coat and hat and was about
to leave the building when some one in
duced him to make an explanatory speech.
This he did. and hit the nail with a full
swing right on the head.
"I have been a member of the Olympic
C.ub for nineteen years." he said, "but I
give decisions as I think they should be.
Mr. Harrison has discredited the officials
of the boxing tournament by his action.
and I refuse to serve In the capacity of
referee for the other bouts. Whether the
decision is right or wrong, the club should
stand by the officials it ' has selected."
Then Mr. Smith left the ring and sat with
the common multitude adjacent the di
rectors' stand, while the crowd cheered
and cheered. Greer Harrison smiled and
beat his programme rhythmically upon his
left wrist. The multitude had swung from
Harrison to Smith. â¢
The boxing was moderately clever last
night and all the bouts were interesting,
some genuinely exciting. Knockouts were
Interspersed sufficiently to give the fights
tone, and the proper color effects were
thrown on facet and ring to appease the
appetite for blood.
The fistic hero of the night was Â¦William
Snailham, Alec Greggains' amateur pro
tege, who is as clever a bantam as he is
strong. Snailham fought two men last
nightâ J. V.-H. Dukey, unattached, and
J. H. Faceo, also without a country- Du
key visited dreamland In the first round
surrendered his job to Ed Smith of the
Reliance Club. Oakland. J. B. was
cheered vehemently by the crowd and for
the ttme the incident blew over, but it Is
sure to create a storm within the Olympic
Club walls during the next few days.
Something happened at the opening of
the Olympic Club's boxing tournament
last night that was not on the programme,
J. R. Smith, official referee, took his hat
and coat after the Berger-Foley fight and
Decision in the Berger-Foley Bout Causes Referee
Smith to Leave the Ring.
