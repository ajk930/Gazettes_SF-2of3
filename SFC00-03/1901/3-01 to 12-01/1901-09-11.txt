to the police that his at

President McKinley was
the result of a conspiracy
in which many besides himself
had a part. So far as can be
learned Czolgosz has refused to
mention any name except that of
Emma Goldman, but papers are
in existence which, if they can be
discovered, will lay bare the en

wholesale arrests, followed by
prosecutions, v^r
Acting under instructions from
Secretary Root, the police refuse
the details of the confession made
by Czolgosz, but in Superintend

Although Emma Goldman
has been arrested in Chicago, it
is probable that ' she will be
brought to Buffalo for trial. The
center. of the conspiracy is here:
To-night Buffalo is filled literally
to i overflowing with agents ot
the Secret Service, scores of
whom came to-day. A search is
being made of every sewer that
underlies the city, for it is known
that in one of them is a package
of papers containing the details
of the conspiracy and the names
of those concerned with Czol
gosz in the plot; "together with
ah outline of its ramifications.
Society may well congratulate
itself that the life of CzolgoSz
was not stamped out by the fren
zied mob that sought to kill him
the moment after he had fired the
second bullet at President Mc-
Kinley. Had he then been put
to death there would have been
no way of bringing his accom
plices to justice. It is now prac
tically assured that at least a
modicum of justice will be meted
out to those who, with Czolgosz,
sought to overthrow law and or

Extend Sympathy to 2Â£rs. McKinley.
OAKLAND, Sept. lO.-The Alameda
County Building Trades Council to-night
sent a telegram to Mrs. McKinley. ex
tending the sympathy of the affiliated un
ions over the attempt to assassinate the
President and expressing hope for the
speedy recovery of her distlguished hus
band.
D. A. Shannon, representing local Union
No. 36, Carpenters and Joiners of Amer
ica, was elected business agent in place
of L. A. Miller, who resigned, private af
fairs compelling; hl3 absence ifrom. the
city. - â¢
Â¦ No action was taken with relation to
water front matters. Sv
The dramatic phase of the situation
here is rapidly disappearing:. Plans over
thrown by the assassin's bullets are being
restored and matters are rapidly assum
ing normal conditions. Indiana day at the
exposition, set for Friday of this week,
was indefinitely postponed when the
President was shot, but the original
programme was restored to-day at the
suggestion of Senator Fairbanks, who
says such a course would not have been
thought of were there any doubt of the
President's recovery. The exposition ha?
suffered severely in attendance since the
tragedy, and the managers are now or
ganizing for a great thanksgiving celebra
tion, which they expect not only to prove
a great card for the fair, but which they
hope will be a day of national rejoicing.
Although the President has been pro
nounced out of danger no member of the
Cabinet has yet been within the sick
room, nor have the "Vice President or
those closest to the confidence of the
President, such as Senator Hanna and
Judge Day. seen the President.
Although the house waa fairly tin
bowered with flowers to-day none of the
sweet-scented blossoms were taken to the
President's chamber. The most rislrl
system of simplicity prevails there, and
sentiment is not allowed to qualify the
stern requirements of the case. The
only person admitted to the sickroom
other than the doctors and attendants
were Mrs. McKinley and Secretary Cor
telyou.
A most important development of the
day was the private determination reach
ed among t>*ose in charge of the caao
that food should be administered to the
patient to-morrow by the mouth. Not
since the shooting has a morsel of food
been given to the President by natural
means, but the drain en his system- has
been met by dissolved food administered
by injection. The importance of th'.a
feeding by the mouth is that it Â¦will tc
store the normal action of the stomac'i.
An Important Development.
Within the sickroom many evidences of
the President's improvement were ap
parent. The President himself began to
show confidence in his ability to care for
himself, and from time to time he wouM
carefully turn himself to get a more rest
ful position. Yesterday he took the pre
caution to ask if he might be permitted
to move, but to-day he changed his po
sition on his own volition without difll
culty. The nurses naturally observed
with care these evidences of growing
strength and courage and were ready
to see that there was no undue tax on
the President's strength or the straining
of -the wound. These slight movements
from side to side were all that he haa at
tempted thus far. and it is too early yet
to think of his sitting up in bed or of
any other marked use of his muscles.
The President will be taken direct to
Washington as soon as it is safe to move
him.
he may be strong enough to bÂ« moved a
little sooner.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET.
N. W., WASHINGTON, Sept. 10.
Chief of the Secret Service Wil
kie, with the help of police offi
cials throughout the United
States, is weaving a net which is
expected to ' catch within its
meshes' every- anarchist who is believed
to have conspired with Czolgosz to brins
about the attempted murder of President
McKinley.
In addition to the arrests made at Buf
falo two other arrests have been made
by Chief Wilkie's orders, those of An
tonio Maggio, at Santa Rita. N. M., yes
terday afternoon, and of Emma Goldman
in Chicago to-day. Orders are already
out for more arrests.
Secret Service Is Active.
Though it is not within the line of their
duties as defined by Congress the secret
service men have been able to keep in
touch with many of the leading anarch
ists throughout the country, and wuen
any of them are wanted it is probable
that Chief Wilkie will be able to locate
them with the help of the police authori
ties in the principal cities. Brass band
methods are not being used in work that
is now being done. Chief Wilkie always
pursues a policy of complete silence un
til results have been accomplished, and
he is more secretive than ever at this
time. No confederate of Czolgosz will
be warned to be on his guard by any
thing he can learn as to what the secret
service is doing.
There is reason to believe that Chief
PATIENT OUT OF DANGER,
Continued From Page One.
Attorney General Knox, who returned
to Washington to-day from Buffalo, is
devoting his attention to the legal as
pects of the attempt to kill the President.
He and Solicitor General Richards had a
long conference to-day about the ques
tion of whether Czolgosz and hia confed
erate. If a conspiracy can be-' proved,
should be tried in the United States
District Court at Buffalo or in a Stazo
court. No definite decision has yet been
reached on this matter and none will be
until the case haa been more carefully
developed.
Much the same policy Is being parsv.ed
in the discussion of the arrest or An
tonio Maggio. All that Chief Wilk!Â» will
say is that Maggio was arrested because
of statements he had made that Presi
dent McKinley would be shot before Oc
tober 1 and that he wished that he had
been selected to do the shooting. It la
known, however, that Chief Wilkie hai
information connecting Maggio with thÂ©
Paterson gang of anarchists and show
ing that he was in communication with
other anarchists In different parts of the
country.
When questioned as to the reasons for
Maggio's arrest Wilkie replied that he
thoug*ht it would be "a good thing to ar
rest him and see what he had to say
for himself."
The Case Against Magglo.
Wilkie expects to connect Emma Gold,
man directly with the crime, especially in
view of the fact that Czolgosz went all
the way to Chicago to see the woman
whose utterances had inspired him to at
tempt to kill the President and. talked
with her about his project.

Goldman/ the high priestess of anarchy:
It is the opinion of several lawyers that
Miss Goldman cannot â¢ be extradited for
trial' in New York: unless she and Czol
gosz are charged, with an offense under
the Federal statutes. The suggestion that
the would-be assassin must be tried un
der the State laws of New York for as
sault with Intent to kill, would, it is said,
preclude the possibility of Miss Goldman
being extradited, as an. accessory before
the fact, as her alleged' incendiary state
ments were not made in New York and
she is not a fugitive from justice from
that State. It is said, however, that she
and Czolgosz might: be charged \wlth\ an
offense under section' 5508 of the
statutes, which fixes a ten-year- term of
imprisonment and a $5000 fine for two or

fore the police when she learned that she
was wanted, Miss Goldman said: -
' "For reasons of my own I did not make
myself known. I like to fool the police
when I can. The very fact that I came
to -Chicago shows that I had no intention
of hiding myself. If I had wanted I
would have'been able to go from St. Louis
right across to Canada, and then they
world have looked for me a long time. ; I
came here especially to be on the spot
when I saw the necessity of announcing
myself to the police, and also to be able
to help Mr. Isaaks and his family, they
being among the anarchists arrested. If
the police were able to connect me with
the- attack on the President I was ready
to give myself up.
"When I arrived In Chicago I went to
a hotel and registered under an assumed
name. Later I went to the home of C. P.
Norrts, whom I have known In a business
way for about a year. As far as I know,
he is not an anarchist, but he saw no
reason why one individual should not give
shelter to another in this land of the free,
and he did it."
Asked if she thought Czolgosz's act was
praiseworthy from her view point, she
answered:
: "I .am -not In a position to say, whether
Â¦it*was -good or:,bad. It 'is bad if or the
man who attempted to do it. I am not
in his boots, and know nothing about it.
What I don't see is why they should make
more fuss about' the President than any
body else. Â¦ All men are born equal."
'.'But some men rise above the equality
of birth," a reporter suggested. We are
all ; interested In the man whom, we have
made our chief."
"I don't think that men put himin- of
fice; I. think money put him in office,"
she replied.
"fhe President's physicians have been

Mr. Wilcox announced that the vice
President had been urged, in view of tha
President's improved condition, to utilize
his last day in seeing some of the Pan-
American Exposition, notably the Gov
ernment building. The Vice President de
clined the invitation with some little ve
hemence. He said:
"I. do not believe, even though I am as
sured of the President's convalescence,
that it would be entirely proper for me
to take part In any of the festivities. I
have studiously refrained from going out
or being entertained during my visit, and
I will continue that policy until I leave.

Denies Her Identity.
When Captain Schuetler and Detective
Hertz discovered her at the home of one
"Czolgosz," and the woman- pronounced
the name with the greatest ease, "may
have been inspired by me, but he took
the wrong way of showing it"
"Am 1 accountable because some crack
brained person puts a wrong construction
on my words? Leon Czolgosz, I am con
vinced, planned the deed unaided and en
tirely alone. There is no anarchist ring
which would help him. There may be
anarchists who murder, but there are
also men in every walk of life who some
times feel the impulse to kill. I don't
know surely, but I think Czolgosz was
one of those down-trodden men who sees
all the misery which the rich inflict upon
the poor, who think of it, who brood over
it, and then in despair resolve to strike a
great blow, as they think, for the good of
their fellowmen. But that is not an
archy. . â¢
"Not even in your lectures?" she was
asked. "He says your words set his
brain on fire."
"I am an anarchistâ a student of sociol
ogyâbut nothing in anything I ever said
to Czolgosz knowingly could have lea him
to do the act which startled everybody
Friday."

another until the police she had derided
so much had taken the matter into their
own hands. She was held on a warrant
sworn out by Captain Colleran, charging
her with conspiracy to murder the Presi
dent.
It is expected that the city will ask for
a continuance of the case, pending ad
vices from Buffalo.
"I shall insist upon an immediate hear
ing." she said, in speaking of the prob
ability of a postponement being asked
for by the city prosecutor. "They want
me to go to ICew York without requisi
tion papers, but I will not go; I know the
legal ropes, and I'll make them fight
every step. And I am not afraid to go
at that."
Admits Meeting Czolgosz.
Miss Goldman's manner was defiant as
she was taken to the office of the Chief
of Police, but she disclaimed all knowl
edge of Czolgosz and his crime, save that
eue admitted having met him here
July 12.
"Do you know that your words are
what Czolgosz elaims stirred him to
shoot the President?" she was asked.
"I do not: I never advocated violence.
I scarcely knew the man. I was leaving
for Rochester via Buffalo when Czolgosz
had A' few words 'with me. He said he
had heard me lecture at some memorial
hall in Cleveland last May and that he
.wanted to know me. He said he knew I
was in Chicago and looked me up. I
scarcely remember anything about him,
save that his complexion was light."
"Then how do you know that this
is the one who tried to kill the Presi
dent?" â¢ ' ...
"Oh," -she replied, with a shrug of the
shoulders, "I guessed that from what the
newspapers say."
Thought He Was a Fool.
"What did you think when you heard
that an attempt to kill the President had
been made?" the woman was asked.
With a wave of her hands and another
shrug of her shoulders she replied dis
dainfully: "I thoughtâ I thought, *Oh,
the fool.' "
The prisoner's manner thus far had been
growing more and more excited, although
she made an evident effort to control her
self. In this she finally succeeded and
launched into a discourse on the teach
ings of anarchy. She declared that an
archy did not teach men to do the act
Â¦which had made Czolgosz despised an-1
hateci the world over.
"We -work against the system, and edu
cation is our watchword," she said. "It
was early last June when I came to Chi
cago to visit the Isaaks family," she con
tinued in answer to interrogations con
cerning her whereabouts recently.
"On the night of July 12 Mr. Isaaks was
cut of the house. The bell rang and I
went to the door. The man who, I learn
through the newspapers, was Czolgosz,
stood there. He said he wanted to see
me. I was about to catch the Nickel
Plate train, as I and Mr. Isaaks'-daugh
ter were about to gx> to Rochester. He
went to the Rock Island depot with us,
but I was so busy taking leave of my
friends that I scarcely noticed him. It
was not a time when one would want
to make new friends. At the depot I had
the few words with him of which I have
told. That was all there ever was be
tween us.
Continued From Page One.
When the interview was over Captain
Luke Coleran, chief of detectives, served
a warrant on Miss Goldman, charging her
with conspiracy to murder the President.
The warrant was sworn to by Captain
Coleran. It gives as her co-conspirators
Isaaks and Miss Goldman deny the as
sertion. They claim that they saw him
last on July 12. This discrepancy In the
stories is now one of the chief points
which the police are trying to solve. They
adhere to the theory that the attack on
the President was the result of a plot
and that they believe the plot was
hatched in the West.
A message from Chief Bull of Buffalo
to Chief of Detectives Coleran asserts
that Czolgosz was in Chicago on August
18 in company with Emma Goldman and
Abraham Isaaks.
"I'm afraid I cannot help them now,"
said Miss Goldman, when the news wa3
brought to her..
At a conference this afternoon the city
authorities resolved to continue to hold
Isaaks and other alleged anarchists under
arrest here without bail.
The chief's office was crowded -while
Miss Goldman talked. Mayor Harrison
was an interested auditor.
Miss Goldman answered in the negative.
She declared that she had stayed at the
Hollenden under an assumed name, so
that the reporters would not bother her.
Miss Goldman's arrest was in answer
to a request sent to the various police
chiefs of the country from Buffalo. Chief
O'Neal telegraphed -Chief Bull, of his cap
ture and will hold the prisoner until the
Buffalo officer takes charge of her.
Talks in Chief's Office*
During the interview Walter Nowak,
who says that he is the" Buffalo man who
identified Czolgosz. asked Miss Goldman
if she boarded with a family of the name
of Mendel while in Cleveland.
"Oh, as to that, I was not quite ready
to show myself. My friends were still in
jail and I wanted to do something for
them. However, you've got me, but what
is there to it? They had me once in NÂ«\v
York because I quoted Cardinal Manning,
who said, 'Necessity knows Â¦ no law," but
what good did that do them?" i
"Why did you deny your Identity?" the
captain pursued.
Not Ready to Show Herself.
"Well," she answered slowly, "I have
been looking for men to go on their bonds,
providing the courts would allow us to
furnish them."
During the talk which followed Miss
Goldman detailed, as best she could
recollect, her movements since last July.
She went from Chicago- to Buffalo, ac
companied by Miss Isaaks, the daughter
of the alleged anarchist editor, under ar
rest here. In Buffalo they stopped two
days and then proceeded to Rochester,
where they stopped at the home of Miss
Goldman's sister, Mrs. H. Hochstefn, of
213 Joseph street. Here they visited a lit
tle more than five weeks. The incident
of it was a short visit to Niagara Falls
and another to New York on business.
In the latter city Miss Goldman entered
temporarily into the employ of a firm,
the name of which she would not divulge:
Business for them carried her to Pitts
burg. She was in Cincinnati Labor day
and that night left for St. Louis.
"I saw the police there Sunday all
right," the prisoner said, with a sarcastic
little laugh, "but they did not see me. I
lieard of the arrest of Isaaks and his
family and other anarchists in Chicago
and determined to come here and see if
I could â¢ not help them. Isaaks had not
Â¦been in the country long and I was afraid
he would not know what to do when in
legal difficulties.."
"What have you done to help them?"
Captain Schuetler asked.
Movements of the "Woman.
"It means that the game is up," she
said. She then admitted her identity
fully and accompanied the officer. The
woman was hurried to the police chief's
office. Her appearance tallied exactly
with the descriptions sent out yesterday.
"What does this mean," ask^d Captain
Schuetler, holding the inscribed pen
holder.
"All right: I speak Swedish myself;"
said the police officer, as he poured a few
questions in the Norse tongue.
Miss Goldman did not answer him, af
fecting to misunderstand. Detective
Hertz, meanwhile, had found a penholder
with the name "Emma Goldman" en
graved on it.
"I m not Miss Goldman, I'm a Swedish
woman and my name is Lena Larsen,"
answered the anarchist, endeavoring to
imitate a Swedish dialect.
"Hello, Miss Goldman," said the cap
tain as he entered the parlor. "Are you
glad to see me?"
Xorrls at Â£03 Sheffield avenue she denied
her identity.

PITTSBURG, Sept. 10.â President Shaf
fer and his advisers in the general office
of the Amalgamated Association hold the
power by authority of the general execu
tive board of the organization- to settle
the steel strike. Shaffer and his advisers
apparently allowed to-day to lapse, after
this authority was vested in them, with
out coming to any settlement. On. Mon
day it is said, the executive board direct
ed President Shaffer, together with Sec
retary-treasurer Williams, Assistant Sec
retary" Tighe and Ben* I. 'Davis of the ad
visory board to settle without delay on the
best terms obtainable. .
The strike to-day in this section was full
of exciting incidents, and unless a speedy
settlement of the troubles is effected in
dications point to exceedingly lively times
from now on. - That both sides are deter
mined on a desperate fight seems evident.
The first evidence of this was shown,- in
the early hours of the day, when a gang
of bricklayers attempted to enter the Na
tional Tube plant at McKeesport and were
turned back. No actual violence resulted,
but had' the workmen insisted on their
right to enter some persons would surely
have been hurt. . _
The tube workers who were turned back
yesterday did not . venture a second at
tempt to-day, and the plant to-night, is
dark and idle. V '.'X:^
r It : was reported that ' the -management
had come to PI ttsburg to secure the pro
tection of Sheriff > McKinley,, but to-night
the Sheriff said no ; call had been made
upon him. The Demmler plant was in
partial operation to-day.^ \
The first violence of the strike Â¦ at Mc-
Keesport, it is reported; took place to
night, when three workmen were set upon
by strikers or / strike sympathizers and
badly beaten. Henry , Weir, a water tender
at - the ; tube " works, - when '.he - came s from
the mill to-night, was ; i warned not to j re
turn in : the - morning. He started to i run,
followed by a crowd., He .was caught and

Richmond District Improvement As~
sociation Urges the Taxing of
Railways in Districts.
The Richmond District Improvement
Association has forwarded to the Board
of Supervisors a resolution concerning
the proposed ordinance to increase the
license tax on streetcars. After calling
attention to the facts that the Sutro road
compelled the Market street road to lower
the fare from 10 to 5 cents to the Cliff
House; that the San Mateo road com
pelled the same company to extend its
lines, and that the Sutro, San Mateo and
Presidio roads are operated at a loss, tho
resolution savs :
Resolved, That while we heartily concur tn
the purpose of your board, we believe that tho
tax should be so levied that no additional bur
dens shall be Imposed upon roads that deal hon
estly with the people, and which have not been
a source of profit to their owners, but that It
should be levied upon the monopoly which
maintains tracks upon all of the streets in the
business part of the city for the purpose ot
preventing op*posltlon lines from gaining accesa
to the travel, while at the same time It has an.
efficient accommodation for the people on only
a fiÂ»w etreets. We believe that this can be best
obtained by taxing streetcar roads in districts,
or taxing their profits: and be It further
Resolved. That It behooves your board to
now take such stepa as will enable the city
to immediately operate the Geary-street road
upon the expiration of its franchise in April
seven months hence.
Public ownership is the only solution of the

From the untraditional brigand -of Cor
tesi, who usually acts his part even when
the audience may reasonably be supposed
to have both eyes on the heroine, to the
delicious unconventionallsm of said hero

Mlcaela's solo In the third act, and im
petuously thrusts a huge basket of La
France roses into her astonished hand,
meanwhile kissing her enthusiasticallyâ >t
was all of another land than this. The
Tivoli has put on the piece with com
mendable care, and all around the opera
shows that unusual effort has been ex
pended on its production. Not that it
went altogether smoothly, for it . was
rough indeed in places, though going all
through with much spirit. But the varied
excitement of the evening was quite suffi
cient to account for the rough edges of
the performance, and to-morrow evening
will doubtless see it quilted and fined
down, to Its great advantage.
The cast is all familiar as far as the
principals go and little remains to be said
thereupon. Collamarini is the same will
ful, fascinating Carmen, with her rich,
warm voice, and characteristic sins in its
use. She drops so quaintly from Carmen
into Collamarini, just as last year, and as
easily back again. The only change â one
not for the betterâ is her added avoirdu
pois, and one rather resents some slight
loss of prettiness In consequence. But it
remains that her Carmen is the favorite
role of the season, and she was welcomed
last night with a most loyal and laudable
enthusiasm by her hosts of admirers.
Russo does some of his best work as Don
Jose, singing with fire and acting the un
lucky captain's part with tremendous en
ergy. Ferrari surprised with a dramatic
and picturesque rendering of the torea
dor's song that' was redemanded with
considerable enthusiasm, and Nicolini was
a lazy Zuniga, permitting his lady love to
make eyes at Don Jose without any of the
usual outward and visible signs of jeal
ousy or even impatience. It is good of
Repetto to sing the part of Micaela, it be
ing by no means grateful to her. Gertrude
Hopkins and Sannie Kruger undertake
the minor roles of Mercedes and Frasqulta
acceptably, and Zani and Cortesi are two
of the best brigands the Tivoli has had.
It was a most grateful change from the
habitual custom of the house, by the way,
to have the brigand scene given without
the amazing spoken interpolations that
have frequently shocked the listener at
the Tivoli. "Carmen" will probably be
continued next week, and "Faust" is to
night's bill.

FOR ARTILLERY
The State Board of Trade makes a busi
ness of disseminating information abroad
concerning- the resources of California for
the purpose of encouraging immigration,
to the State. The requests for such, in
formation cover a wide range of topics.
The fame of California as a mining State
has established the fact that there would
be demands for mining literature from
persons who might come here from
abroad to mine. Such inquiries have
been made to quite a large number an
nually ever since the State* Board of
Trade came into existence, and they were
always answered .until within the last
few weeks by forwarding, free of charge,
some bulletin of the State Mining Bureau.
Now inquirers are informed that they
can get the information they desire only
by paying a specified price, and they re
ceive in answer to their requests for in
formation a printed slip, issued by the
State Mineralogist, in which that an
nouncement is set forth clearly. The
State Board of Trade cannot give the in
formation that is sought, and there is an
obstacle that there is no seeming way of
overcoming while there is a price for the
Mining Bureau publications.
A difference of opinion has developed
between the State Mineralogist and the
State -Board of Trade concerning the
method of distributing the publications
'of the State Mining Bureau.- Until qulto
I recently, the ; bulletins and other reports
'prepared under the -direction of the State
Mineralogist' have been given gratuitous
ly to any, one who sought them. Out of
this ' practice grew, several abuses, one of
which Was the cornering of a valuable
edition of any sort by second-hand book
men, who then sold the copies at a round
price when there was a 'demand for them.
From this it" resulted that the edition of
an" oil bulletin prepared by Professor
Watt in the administration of State Min
eralogist Cooper was soon exhausted and
copies were for sale for,$l 50 in the second
hand book stores, and a speculator made
hay. while the sun shone by having it un
derstood that he had a limited number of
copies that he would sell at the price
named, viz., $1 50 per copy.
When State Mineralogist Aubury en
tered into office he found that several
standard bulletins were out of print and
there were not sufficient funds available
to reprint them. He therefore concluded
that all publications of the State Mining
Bureau should hereafter .have a price,
and he took pains to have that fact ad
vertised. Â¦ ' , v. Â¦ Â¦ - â¢ '.Â¦Â¦Â¦;Â¦Â¦Â¦-'Â«

some identifications.
Dr. I. Saylin, who entertained
Emma Goldman- and her mother
when the two women were in
Buffalo, is being sought by the
police. It cannot be learned that
a warrant for his arrest has been
issued, but his explanations are
earnestly desired. He left.Buffa
lo suddenly last Friday night a
few hours after the attempted as
sassination of President McKin
ley. His wife, who denies all
knowledge of Emma Goldiran,
says that the doctor has gone in
search of health, but that she
knows nothing more of his presÂ«
ent whereabouts than -that he" is
far awav from Buffalo.
Slight Irritation Causes New Opera-
WOUND REOPENED
BY THE SURGEONS
tion, but Medical Men Are Not
Apprehensive.
MILBUBN HOUSE, BUFFALO, Sept.
10.â Late to-night there was a slight scare
at the Milburn residence, caused by the
protracted visit of the consulting physi
cians, who -remained almost two hours,
and this was increased by the announce
ment in the official' bulletin issued just
before midnight that a slight irritation
of the wound, discovered only to-night,
had necessitated the opening of a few
of the stitches. A5)<^
As stated in the bulletin, which all the
doctors signed, this irritation was at
tributed to the fact that a small portion
Â¦of the President's coat had been carried
into the body by the bullet, and although
this foreign substance was removed a
slight disturbance developed which made
it necessary to open the wound. v'r'.vV'
The doctors seek to allay all apprehen
sion by the positive statement that this
incident cannot give rise to other com
plications, and their frankness in giv
ing the news to the public leaves no rea
son to question their good faith. Further
facts communicated in the bulletin, that
the President is now well enough to be
gin taking nourishment in the mouth in
the form of pure beef juice, was of course
gratifying, but to the laymen the. mere
mention of a complication, however 1
slight it might be, naturally created
alarm. But the most positive assurances
v.-ere given that the only effect might be
to delay slightly the healing of the
wound. It was not In any way the result
even of a suggestion of blood poisoning.
The physicians declared over their own
signatures that it could not. result in
complications. Â¦ ;Â¦Â¦â¢'â¢
The opening of the wound, was in no
sense an operation. Several of the
stitches were simply taken out, and after
a thorough washing of the tissue the
wound was again sewed up. Considerable
delay was caused by the fact that a.cer
tain dressing desired by the surgeons was
not in the house, and it was necessary to
send to the city for it. The first time
the messenger returned he did not have
what was wanted and he had to make
another trip. â¢ â¢*'â¢' .'â¢* ."
After the bulletin was issued Secretary
Cortelyou and Mr. Mllburn - came to . the
press tent to dispel any alarm that might
have arisen with positive assurance of
the unimportance of the incident. Secre
tary Cortelyou announced that â¢ there
would not be another 'consultation until
morning.
After all this it was quiet at the Mil
burn house, Dr. Rixey and Dr. Wasdln
remaining.on duty throughout the night.
Some time later Marie Isaak and
Emma Goldmah left Chicago for
Buffalo. They visited the Expo
sition and then went to Roches
ter, where they visited Mrs. H.
Hochstein, at 213 Joseph ave
nue. A little later Emma Gold
man went to Allegheny City and
there consulted with Carl Nold,
who was taken irito custody last
Monday. From Allegheny City
Emma Goldman went to Cincin
nati, thence to St. Louis, thence
to Chicago and then back to
Buffalo.
CASE AGAINST WOMAN.
The secret police know,
although Emma Goldman and
Isaak now attempt to deny their
intimacy with Czolgosz, that
when Emma Goldman started
for Buffalo Czolgosz accompa
nied her to the railroad station.
Five anarchists now under arrest
in Chicago have made statements
to the effect that they saw Czol
gosz while he was in Chicago
consulting with Emma Goldman
and Abraham Isaak. This ren
ders the case against the Free
Society complete, and it is likely
that on or before September 19
Governor Odell will be asked to
requisition the prisoners from the
Governor of Illinois. Emma
Goldman will precede the Isaak
faction to Buffalo and, according
to nresent plans, she may bo in
the dungeon in this city before
the week is over.
Another point which was set
tled to-day by the prosecuting of
ficials is the fact that President
McKinley need not be in Buffalo
during the examination of pris
oners, either before the commit
ting magistrate or Grand Jury at
the trial. There are enough wit
nesses and medical testimony to
establish the crime without the
President, who would otherwise
be tlie chief complainant, being
present.
RELEASED MEN SHADOWED.
According to the police of
Buffalo, Stutz and Walter No
wak have been released from cus
tody, no evidence having been
adduced that was strong enough
to warrant their being held. It
;is true that Stutz has been, re
leased, but on the authority of
Superintendent Bull it can be
said that he can be arrested again
at a moment's notice. He may
be of more service free than in
jail. He is being closely shad
owed, and may lead the police to
others who are wanted. Walter
Nowak is said to have gone to
Chicago to take employment as
a cigarmaker. He went from po
lice headquarters direct to the
railroad station, where he took a
train for Chicago. A secret ser
vice agent went with him, or, at
least, was in the same car with
him the entire distance from Buf
falo to Chicago. Xowak may ac
cept employment as a cigannak
er in Chicago, but it is certain
that he will also be made use. of
by secret service agents to make

the President.
Delegates to the Union Labor Conven-
Resolutions relating to the ' attempted
assassination of President McKinley were
presented to the convention of the Union
Labor party 'last night. The first set,
known as the Bowlan resolutions, -were
adopted and ordered swread , upon ,the
minutes. They read as follows:
Whereas. This convention of the Union Labor
perty adjourned in anxiety and grief on Fri
day last on account of the dastardly attempt on
the life of the beloved President' of the re
public, William McKinley; and whereas, the
glad tidings have since come to us that there
is good reason to believe that Â¦ the President
will recover from the cruel wounds inflicted by
the fanatical wretch who so cowardly assaulted
him. Therefore be it
Resolved, That the Union Labor party halls
with heartfelt gladness the Improved condition
of the President and expresses the earnest hope
that many years of health and happiness may
compensate him for the suffering and horror
of the ordeal through which he is so bravely
passing.
Resolved. That while rejoicing over the recov
ery of President McKinley and recognizing the
foul attempt upon his life as a crime against
free government for which no punishment coul.i
be too severe, we condemn and denounce . as
shameful and unmanly all efforts to mak-> po
litical capital out of the agony and sorrow oi
a national calamity. And further be it -
Resolved, That we heartily approve the pa
triotic words of Vice President Â¦ Roosevelt In
speaking to men who work for their daily
bread: â¢ '
"You men are our protection and the foul
deed done on the afternoon of Friday will only
make you the more vigorous in your protection
of the lives of those whom you elect to office.
Such men as you can work with the ballot the
salvation of the country without resort to
violence."

to die had come yesterday when three
cougars, two of them full grown, attacked
him in the thick woods in the Grays Har
bor country. May had been hunting and
luckily was armed with both a good rifle
and a hunting knife. He was tired from,
his iong: tramp, and had 'reached a point
three miles from a logging camp, where
he intended spending the night, when ha
was compelled to cross a small ravine.
At the bottom of the ravine there was a
audden movement In ' the bushes and al
most before he knew it a cougar of more
than ordinary size had- Jumped straight
at him.

The trouble occurred about 10 o'clock,

threw at the workers. These workers re

Â£^fl-o HE Employers' Association held a
I special meeting yesterday at 11
I o'clock, at which the entire strike
JX situation was discussed. More
than 250 members were present, 1
and after full consideration a vote of con
fidence was given the directors and ex
ecutive committee for their management
cf strike affairs.
There had been a disposition on" the part
of mediators to insist, that a meeting of
representative employers would result in
a reversal of policy and lead to consent to
arbitrate or to a direct conference with
the strike leaders. Their hope proved to
be baseless, and as a result of the meet-
Ing yesterday it is now acknowledged on
all hands that mediation is a vain hope.
The executive committee of the Dray
men's Association held its usual meeting,
but the much-discussed terms of peace
were not considered. The expectation of
the teamsters that to-day would see the
settlement of the strike now seems to
have been entirely without logical basis.
Cases of attacks upon non-union labor
ers were comparatively few, and the
strike leaders say they will not increase
now that hope of concessions on the part
of the employers is gone.
The holiday interim was followed by a
rejuvenation of industry along the water
front and in the wholesale district. Ap
pearances were much more nearly those
that obtain under normal conditions than
have been seen since the strike began.
tailed by the strike the services of the
committee of the Merchants' Association
be so used as to bring an end to the pres
ent labor struggle In this city.
Murdock's substitute was declared to
be a resolution, however, and was side
tracked until action was taken on Cu
bery's motion and its substitute.
The substitute that, the action of the
directors be indorsed was carried unani
mously, the motion for a special commit
tee being thereby killed.
A substitute to Murdock's resolution
was presented by J. Taylor. He favored
that definite action be taken by (he as
sociation, and asked those present to de
clare by vote that they were fully in ac
cord with the policy of resistance to the
demands of organized labor.
A. Flagolette, a master butcher, made
a plea for the strikers.
O. K. von Rhein made a short speech,
in which he opposed the substitute of
Taylor. He urged that calm deliberation
was vital to the interests of the entire
community.
Opposed to Labor's Dictation.
"You cannot sit in judgment on both
sides of this question," Von Rhein said,
"when all present are interested on one
side. We have no disposition to crush
unions, as has been stated by the yellow
press. We are, willing, to recognize the
unions, but we are opposed to any dicta
tion by the labor leaders. I hope the sub
stitute of Mr. Taylor will not prevail. It
is unnecessary and humiliating to the la
boring element, and instead of being con
ciliatory is likely to arouse passions on
the other side."
F. W. Dohrmann. ex-president of. the
association, received an. ovation when he
ascended the platform. . .
Â¦ "I do not wish â¢ to see- the substitute
prevail." said the speaker, "for It .will do
no good, but may do harm. The unions
have , appealed to this association to help
them put an end to the present deplora
ble conditions. -There Is no desire on the
part of employers to crush unions.. I
want to tell you of my own experiences
with unions. Some, time ago a man
named Casey came to me and asked me
to induce my truck driver to join a union.
He insisted that the union was for the
benefit of the stablemen, who worked
long hours for small wages. I told Casey
that the plan had my sympathy and I
spoke to my'truck driver. He said to me
that he was being paid more wages Â¦ by
me. than he would Vet under the union
schedule and he - declined . to Join the
union. Again Casey came' to me . and
begged me to use my Influence with my
driver to have him join the union. I did
so. and when' my driver told~ me it would
cost him $25 to Join I gave him the. money
to do so. Many of vou have done like
wise, yet we are accused of trying to

of Cubery that the meeting in

Charles A. Murdock favored a calm
consideration of the situation and begged
those present to come to a just and hon
orable decision.
"I am not in favor of censuring the
board cf directors," he said, "for they
have acted wisely In not taking Fides in
this issue. We want peacemakers, not
partisans. If the Employers' Association
concedes to the employes the right to
form unions the employes must concede
the right of the employers to hire union
or non-union men."
Favors Calm Deliberation.
\V. M. Cubery. one of the members- who
requested the president to call the meet
â¢ln"" declared that the city was on the
verge of financial ruin and that some radi
cal steps must "be taken to end the strike.
He pointed out the errors of the employ
ers and the employes in Uhe present strug
gle as h" considered them. The speaker
did not present any solution to the labor
problem other than to offer a resolution
that a committee of five members be ap
pointed by the chair to endeavor to bring
about a settlement of the strike. The
resolution was seconded by Joseph Seidl,
and the sentiment of the meeting was
shown by loud cries of "question" when
a gentleman in the rear of the hall rose
j" Kelly moved as a substitute to the
resolution that the association express its
approval of the actions of the board of
directors as to the present industrial com-
P ThV Fi>eech - of Mr. Kelly was received
with hearty applause, and a similar greet
ing was arcorded to L.. A. Robertson, who
favcred the substitute and paid his re
*wcts to th* "yellow press." which he de
clared had fostered the spirit of antago
nism among worklngmen. - .; .' â¢
To mention those who were present at
the meeting would be to give the names of
men who are pillars of strength in ilnan
cial. commercial and other important
branches of commerce. Millionaires sat
side by side with retail storekeepers, eacli
prepared to listen calmly and pass judg

President Symmes received an ovation
when he ascended the platform and ex
plained the cause of the call for the
X&eetini;.
â¢â¢Ten members of this association, he
eald, "have requested that this special
mt-etir.g be held, and according to our
constitution the call was issued.
"The Merchants' Association has the in
terests of the city at heart and has kept
a careful watch upon the unfortunate con
dition that now besets u^. We have not
taken tides in the labor dispute, for the
reason that this organization has a special
mission to fulfill and we did not desire to
injure our influence In the community In
the future by a partisan attitude. We
have not been lukewarm in the matter, as
has been charged. - The board of directors
appointed a special committee to act with
other committees appointed by commer
cial bodies. This Joint committee was
formed to render all possible assistance In
settlement of the labor dispute. 1 ask
all present to listen calmly and with de
liberation to the statements of the gentle
men who have asked for this special gath
ering of the Merchants* Association."
Wants a Special Committee.
More than 600 citizens, members of the
Merchants* Association, answered the call
for a special meeting, sent cut by Presi
dent Frank J. Symmes at the written re
quest of ten members of the organization.
These words uttered last evening by F.
W. Dohrmann at the ma-s-meeting'of the
members cf the Merchants' Association,
held at Golden Gate Hall, caused a scene
of remarkable enthusiasm, in which the
representative business men prerent de
clared their sentiments as to the prc&ent
industrial situation in San Francisco.
HE who comes into a court of
equity must do so with clean
hanus. There must be no blood

A motion to lay Taylor's substitute on
the table was carried unanimously amid

voted down. ;When President Symmes
asked those present ' if " they desired -to

"We have not as yet been called upon
by any citizen to demand protection from
the State for his property," said Paris
Kilburn, president of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners, yesterday. "In
the early stages of the teamsters' strike
James McNab, who was driving a team,
complained to us that the nuts had been
screwed off his wagon while it was on
State property. He found later that this
was not so and withdrew his complaint.
Had it been true the matter would have
been investigated and the necessary pro
tection afforded.
State property begins where the city,
property leaves off, and this is described
by an irregular line commencing at the
south head and extending to the San Ma
t^o County line. . The principal portion Is
that which lies between the western end
of the seawall at North Beach and ex
tends around the city front. Perhaps the
best known portion -of it is embraced
within the territory extending from the
old westerly slope of Telegraph Hill along
the westerly line of East street and
around Rlncon Hill to the mail dock and
westward again. This embraces a dis
trict several miles in length, and is prac
tically the center of nearly all the strike
troubles.
State's Property on the Front.
Attorney General Ford was not pre
pared to give an opinion last night; but
nis impression was that the State's ten
ants must look to the city for. protection
until the failure of such authority was
regularly proclaimed.
Governor Gage was asked by a Call cor
respondent yesterday what his probable
action would be. He replied that he was
too busy to be interviewed. -
It is generally admitted that the State
has the right to police its property wheth
er or not city or county authorities re
gard themselves able to cope with the
situation. But differences of opinion ex
ist when the question is raised as to the
right of the tenants to demand protection
of the State.
The Harbor Commissioners will first be
called upon to act, and if they are not
equal to the emergency appeal will be
made to Governor Gage. The increase of
the State harbor police is pointed out as
the natural method of furnishing protec
tion to the State's. tenants, with the mili
tia as a last resort, if less drastic meas
ures fail.

Present at the meeting were: N. P.
Chlpman, E. D. Sweetzer, Craigie Sharp
of the Oakland Eoard of Trade, John P.
Irish. J. S. Emery, Arthur R. Briggs and
W. H. .Mills. Horace Wilson was an in
terested spectator.
Mr. Mills explained the scarcity' of
cars by calling attention to the conges
tion In the railroad yards and warehouses
at this port. There were lots of men to
clear away the blockade, he said, but un
less proper protection was afforded these
men they were afraid to work. If the
protection to which they were entitled
was forthcoming, he said, the blockade
would be cleared away in twenty-four
hours and all the cars .the San Joaquin
farmers and other farmers of the State
wanted would very. soon be set 'at liberty
to move the crops.
The San Joaquin farmers had been
given to understand, he said, that the
embargo at Port Costa had been raised
and that the warehouses there would now
receive the crops. The crops were all
ready, he said, but they wwe unable to
get cars.
Arthur R. Briggs oi Fresno, who is not
only a member of the board but a farmer
on a*large scale, said that he had 300 car
loads of grain lying on his place and
stood to lose it all unless he could get
cars to move it. / *\.
Farmers Unable to Get Cars.
E. D. Sweetzer, a member of the board
from Santa Rosa, told of the condition of
affairs in his part of the country.. In So
noma County.- he said, there â¢ are over
10.000 tons of hay lying in the. fields await
ing either removal to market or destruc
tion by the rains which may be expected
at any time now. Every structure with
a roof is being utilized for the protection
of the crop. . George P. one of
the heaviest hay buyers in the State, is
using an old cannery and a church for
hay barns. The element of available pro
tection cuts considerable figure in the
price obtained by the farmer for his hay.
Mr. Sweetzer 3aid that McNear was buy
ing hay, and trusting to the rain holding
off or to chance enabling him to get
shelter, j for $2 50 a ton. while men Â»tha.t
had secured storage places were Â¦ paying
$10 50 a. ton. During the past few weeks
Mr.. Sweetzer has been making a. tour of
his .county. Ha fpjund . crops . unusually
heavy everywhere. ' He also' found' the
country overrun with * strikers from San
Francisco who were dividing their time
between intimidating the : country la
borers to prevent their coming to San
Francisco and taking those same-country
laborers' jobs at wages the country la
borer would scorn. Nearly every ham
let, he said, contained one or more vic
tims of the San Francisco country labor
reception committee.
Colonel Irish then drafted, an appeal to
the 'city's chief executive which the
board promptly approved,, signed find

"An Idea seems to have got- about,"
Colonel Irish said, "that Chief of
Police Sullivan is responsible for the fail
ure to suppress the lawlessness which
has recently prevailed in the cfty. That
is a mistake. Sullivan Is only a subor
dinate. Phelan's responsible. Let's me
morialize the Mayor."
It was at first intended to memorialize
only the Governor. Colonel John P. Irish,
however, pointed out, that under- the
charter Mayor Phelan was specifically
charged with the preservation of the

"We had a discussion in. a general way
upon the proposition this morning," said
Governor Budd. It was merely In
formal. The board has as yet had no oc
casion seriously to consider the matter.
It would not be proper as an attorney to
give out in advance what my opinion
would be in a contingency affecting . the
rights of property of those of whom I

would be advisable to go, but I must de

wanted protection for its laborers it

Government to -send a regiment of 'troops

necessary no doubt it would have been
followed. -The State is in practically the
same position. All the outrages commit
ted by strikers have been without the
zone under control of the State, and
therefore we have not felt that It was
either wise or necessary to invoke State

had been exhausted."
Ex-Governor James H. Budd, attorney
for the State Board' of Harbor Commis
sioners, declined to express an opinion re
garding the powers or duties of the State
in the premises until the matter, had been
officially brought to his attention by the
Harbor Commissioners.
','When I hear of these continued at
tacks on men engaged in lawful efforts to
earn a living it seems to me that we are

to see whether there was any protection
to be had from California laws.

Neither executive has done anything. The

morial to the Governor we have taken a

Solano County, where there are T75.OW

wheat, to move it in two hours, but the
laborers, otherwise willing and able, are

Appeals Ttfade in Vain.
The facts laid before the Mayor and
Governor were that the crops of , the State
were lying exposed to the elements and
in danger of destruction; that there was
in the State all the labor , necessary to
remove these crops; that the laborers
who were able and willing to move the
crops were afraid to do so tor fear of per
sonal injury; that they would work if the
necessary protection was assured; that
this protection had been requested, but
had not been forthcoming; that the dan
ger to the crops increased with every
hour of delay, and that if neither execu
tive officer acted, and promptly, the citi
zens wouid nave to taKe.tne matter in

California has seen equaled only once
before, and the men who have raised and
gathered it forced to watch it rot on their
land because 'of a ' quarrel between two
bodies of citizens in the State's chief port.
Thus spoke W. H. Mills at a meet
ing of the State Board of Trade yesterday
afternoon; and in so speaking seemed to
voice the sentiments of every member
present. Expressions of the board's sen
timents took the form of memorials ad
dressed to Governor Gage and to Mayor

versy were carefully avoided both In the

PROTECTION MUST
BE GIVEN MEN WHO
DESIRE TO WORK
Great Meeting of Representative Business Men
; Fails to Develop Any Sentiment Demanding
Change of Attitude of Employers' Association
GOVERNOR IS PETITIONED TO PUT
STOP TO EXISTING LAWLESSNESS
eimO his Excellency, the Governor of the State of Californiaâ Sir: Ths
commercial instrumentalities which hav* been depended upon to move
the crops of the State to market have been paralyzed by a contention
between employers and employes !n the chief export port and com
mercial metropolis of the State. The wheat which has been' harvested
has been racked, and for the most part is exposed to the menace of
destructive elements. The results of industry are about to be destroyed.
A season's labor is menaced with toss.
Ample facilities for the storage of the wheat crop of the State of Cali
fornia exists at Port Costa and other places In the State. The crop in sacks
has been piled in fields, on the banks of navigable rivers and at station?
along the lines of railways. It has been' found impossible' to move these
crops because of the belief that those who have heretofore been employed In
various capacities necessary to the removal cf the harvest have refused to
â¢work and have also refused to permit others to perform the neceasary labors
for the preservation of the harvest.
As an illustrative case and to brlns the actual situation clearly before
you. your memorialists respectfully represent that at Main Prairie, In Solano
County, there are l.o.OOO sacks of wheat piled along the bank of that estuary
â¢.waiting shipment. It will require less than two hours to transport this
wheat to Port Costa.
Men can be found to perform the necessary labor for the removal of this
wheat to the warehouses at Port Costa, but they are deterred from doing so
by fear of violence and bv the belief that an actual danger to their lives
exists if they engage in such employment. /
Vnder these circumstances the question arises as to whether the Govern
ment of the State of California owes to the agriculturists of the State that
protection which would enable them to take care of their property. The
instance cited is but one of many. Practically the entire wheat crop of Cali
fornia awaits shipment to the seaboard.
"VV> are in possession of information with which we desire to make you
acquainted, that the crop of the State cannot be moved because of the belief
that danger of violent interference with those who would be engaged in per
forming' the labor cf such removal exists.
In the view of your netitlDners It is the first duty of governments : to
govern. It is the paramount duty of an executive to prevent injury arising
from violent interference with the industry of a commonwealth if danger
fiom Interference exists. Your petitioners, therefore, most earnestly and
respectfully call your attention to the impending disaster to the industries of
the State, and respectfully petition your Excellency to take such steps as
will afford a guarantee against the injurious effects .of the lawlessness by
which the industry of the State appears to be obstructed.
Tour petitioners are justified by information in their possession In the
statement that the men who harvested the crops of California stand ready
to perform the labor necessary to their storage against the destruction of the
natural elements, or their transmission to seaboard or their shipment to final
market; but before they can be Induced to perform that duty they must have
assurances or guarantees at the hands of the government of the State of
California that they will be permitted to pursue this peaceful occupation
unmolested, and that they will be made secure against the danger of personal
harm or violence.
The chief point of storage for the grain of this State is at Port Costa,
where there is no municipal organization which may be depended upon to
protect warehouse men in the pursuit of their occupation, and besides this
the difficulties confronting the farmers of this State are as broad as the
entire commonwealth, and it has appeared to your petitioners that an appeal
for protection necessary to overcome the difficulties ar.d dangers of ihe
situation should be made to the State government itself. We, therefore,
respectfully request at your hands such investigation of the facts as may
disclose to the executive mln<f the necessary remedies and the earliest
practical application of such remedies.
This presentation is made without reference to the merit of any contro
versy existing between employers and employes. It is ari appeal based upon
tfip necessity cf those who are in no wise parties to any conflict which may
exist between employers and employes in the* city of San Francisco, or in
any other port of export and import commerce.
It is an appeal which is based upon thÂ» fundamental rights of the citizens
of the State to pursue their legitimate occupations ..unmolested by violent
interference. It is made in the full belief that the Governor of the State of
California possesses the power, and, therefore, is under the responsibility of
protecting the citizens of the State against the loss which Is now threatened.
As in duty bound your petitioners will ever pray.

THE* SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, -SEPTEMBER- 11, 1901.
Therefore, we respectfully memorialize you as the executive of this city
to take immediate measures to enforce the law, by protecting adequately the
men who desire to work, making them safe while in employment and going
to and from their homes. If the resources at your disposal are inadequate to
procure peace, keep order and protecUlabor, we respectfully request that you
call upon the Governor of California to supply such means as will 'accomplish
the purpose that must be effected if this city is to be saved from disorder and
the producers of the State from widespread and distressing loss.

Â¦tpO his Honor Mayor James D. Phelanâ Sir: Tour memorialist, the Cali
fornia State Board of Trade, respectfully represents that the important
export commerce of San Francisco is obstructed and millions of dollars'
worth of perishable property belonging: to the farmers of this State ia
expcsed to complete destruction by the failure in this city of lawful pro
tection to men who desire to work and are willing to perform all .the
Â¦ labor required to move commerce and save the crops of the State. The
position of San Francisco, as the chief port of this coast and the principal in
let and outlet of its commerce, seems to us to be imperiled by this lack of
lawful protection to- labor, while the prosperity of this city will be griev
ously impaired by the losses inflicted upon the State's producers by the fail
ure of legal protection' here to men who are willing to work. â¢ , -

Injustice of Gage.
Cloverdale Reveille.
Governor Gage, for to him is directly
due the removal of Dr. A. E. Osborne
from the Glen Ellen home, has not only
done an injustice to a competent official,
one who had earned the respect of all
for the most efficient manner In which the
affairs of the home were conducted, but
he has done a gross injustice to the peo
ple of Sonoma County. For fifteen years
under the management of Dr. Osborne
this institution has been the best con
ducted of all the public institutions of
the State. No scandal or disgrace in any
way. came up to mar the good name of
the home, but we find a fatherly interest
manifest, an interest in the poor unfor
tunate inmates that was not bought for
hire, but the outcome of an. affectionate
and ' kindly heart. Sonoma County re
sents the acts of Governor Gage and his
political affairs as a blot on the good
name the home has borne and to Sonoma
County, in whose domain the home is sit
uated. Â¦

In the language of the hand, "square

ANDREW FURUSETH, in 'a statement pub
lished yesterday, exulted in the fact that the
majority of the Sailors* Union are indifferent
to the prosperity of the port of San Francisco, or to
the welfare of American workingmen. Boasting of
that indifference, he is quoted as saying: "The sail
ors are not worrying about when the strike will end;
if they cannot find work here they can find it else
where. They can go to the Eastern ports, or to
Europe. I have seen 1200 men leave the port of San
Francisco within two months. That was in 1893.
Many of the sailors are foreigners who have relatives
in Europe, and they would not object to a trip to the
old country. Probably 900 out of the 1500 sailors
now on the beach are not citizens of the United
States. These men would gladly ship as deep-sea
tailors to visit their frifnds. We have no objection
to having the men ship as deep-sea sailors, and there
is a great demand for them. Runners for sailors'
boarding-houses are offering as much as $40 a man
for every one they will secure to go to sea. Most
of our men have no hindrances to keep them in San
Francisco. They can easily go to other ports to find
work. I do not believe that more than 5 per cent
of the men are married."-
That plain statement ought to open the eyes of
American workingmen to the menace of the situation.
Accepting Furuseth's statement as true, it will be
seen that a union composed mainly of foreigners and
almost wholly of unmarried men is now endeavoring
to tie up the trade of the port, prevent the shipment
of the products of our farms and enforce idleness and
the danger of destitution upon the homes of Ameri
cans; and, moreover, are doing it with a feeling of
impunity, for, as Furuseth says, they can profit by
the stagnation of business here to make a trip to
Europe, visit their friends and have a good time
whiie American hpmes are bearing the affliction of
the strike.
Such a statement, emanating from such a source,
aggravates the wrong done to the public. It is in the
nature of an insult added to- injury. It is a mocking
declaration that American workingmen with families
to support are to be forced out of employment by
a union of irresponsible foreigners having no interest
in the country whatever. It is a defiance not only of
law and of society but of the American home itself.
It virtually says to the community, "Let' your farm
products rot on the wharves, let the homes of your
workingmen be destitute, let the wives and the chil
dren of Americans lack for. food; we are going to
make a holiday of the strike and go to our homes
in Europe."
The unfairness of the situation is evident Ameri
can workingmen are expected to place themselves at
the orders of foreigneis; men with families are ex
pected to submit themselves to the dictation of un
married men; those who have a stake in the city and
in society are to be dominated by those who have
none; persons of responsibility are to be controlled
by persons who have no responsibility whatever.
It is not easy to conceive a situation more intol
erable than this which has been so exultantly depicted
by Furuseth. The merchants of the city, the farmers
of the State and workingmon of nearly all classes are
injured by the strike of men who openly boast that
they are doing all the mischief without any hurt to
themselves. Of the 1500 men now on the beach,
says Furuseth, probably 900 are not citizens of the
United States, and he estimates that not more than
S per cent are married. Such is the force that is
operating against the business of the port and the in
dustry of the State. How long will Americans sub
mit to it?

PERSONAL MENTION.
To show that sentiment here is not exceptional, but is common with that a!l over the
country we quote here the New York Saturday Press: "Yellow journalism has attained
its savage ambition â the assassination of one who by virtue of his lofty office represents
the very essence of all that yellow journalism and -anarchy hateâ authority, government
and law. At the door of the New York Journal and its kind shall the people of the United
States lay the atrocious crime against the President of the United States." The New
York Sun, referring to the above, said: "This refers, no doubt, to the infamous handiwork
of the editor who proclaims openly that it is his ambition 'to have the Supreme Court of
the United States tarred and feathered in the streets of Washington!' Just how long mer
chants and the people of New York will tolerate this sort of thing remains to be seen."
The Sun and Press seem to agree with Mr. Gavin McNab, who, speaking of the
assassination, said, "At last Hearst's papers have accomplished something."
Our space, permits no further quotations to-day. In addition to what the press
says, The Call is in receipt of hundreds of letters to the same purport, on the assassina
tion and the strike. One expresses the meaning of all. Referring 'Â¦. to our paragraph on
Sunday under the caption "Lawlessness Must Cease," the writer says : "Nothing more
true. Follow it up and you will have a thousand followers .where our .fathers had hun
dreds in the days of Vigilance men. As I, pen these lines the ambulance passes my door,
carrying another victim -of the 'peaceful strikers.' with his body torn arid beaten*''
It is apparent Â¦ that the. State is ready to back up a movement to enforce order in
this city, and secure the safety of the men who are at work. WS&Si
President Wheeler's allusion to "the Vigilance men" seems to have struck' a
popular chord throughout the State, and people everywhere see in the lawlessness of the
strikers, encouraged by the Examiner;" the same spirit which it encouraged to murder the
President. v : . .
THE volume of expressions in the country press- of this State against the vio
lence and apparent ethics and purpose! of the strike, and in : stern reprehension of
the course of the Examiner in that and other matters, is so immense as to
render general reproduction in our columns impossible. But in order. that all
men concerned in the industries and business of this city may be informed as to the con
dition of intelligent country sentiment, and may see the overwhelming disfavor in which
lawlessness is held, we condense what is said by the fearless and untrammeled country
editors, reflective of the sentiment around them. . , .
The Humboldt Standard commends The Call for coming out "with courage and
vigor in favor of law and order in San Francisco. It is .to be commended. ' How. con
temptible the yellow Examiner, appears ; beside .the v clear-cut .and courageous utterances
of The Call. Every honest striker will have more respect for The Call than for the cring
ing, sycophantic Examiner." " ' "" - â -
The Redding Free Press says: '"There are "people in the; United States who, had
they the courage of their unreasoning hatred, would be' willing to attempt the life of
President McKinley. They are the jaundiced people who have been diseased by the yel
low press. The odium, infamy, and shameless libel heaped upon President McKinley,
Vice President Roosevelt and others at the nation's head by such freak newspapers as
the New York Journal, Chicago American and San Francisco Examiner is not without
its effect. They are the organs of anarchy â the more powerful because they move be
hind a mask."
The Evening Blade of Santa Ana, a few hours before the attack on the President,
said: "The Anarchists' Own,' otherwise the San Francisco Examiner, continues its ill
meant efforts to stir up all the strife it can between employers and employes."
The Visalia Delta says: "There are to-day in all parts of the country hotbeds of
anarchy. These anarchists are. encouraged by yellow journals like the New York Jour
nal and San Francisco Examiner, and deeds of violence naturally follow.- . Unless the gates
tire closed to foreign riffraff and yellow journalism is suppressed there will be troub
lous times in the near future." ... . ' : .
MarySVille Appeal: "Yellow journalism, by foul cartoons and reckless lying and
bitter attacks, did its share to bring about the awful tragedy of Friday, by which alone the
Pan-American fair will be remembered." ,. ' '
Woodland Mail: "The attempted assassination of President McKinley is a- most
terrible and damnable outrage, and can be traced almost directly to yellow journalism."
Alameda Argus: "There have been many outrageous representations in connec
tion with the San Francisco strike, but none that excelled . in pusillanimity that regard
ing the discharge of theStrauss factory girls. The paper (the Examiner) that makes it a
practice to misrepresent everybody and stick to it announced that half the Strauss force
had been discharged on account of boycott of the firm's goods. It stated this with glee,
but it was a clear-cut fabrication."
Sausalito Advocate: "Many idle men, strikers, encouraged by the Examiner, are
standing around the streets waiting for the success of a lost cause."
Stockton Independent: "To trace the conspiracy that has led to this infamous
assassination it will' be necessary to examine experts -on mental infirmities- and deduce
from their testimony the natural and unavoidable impressions and influences exerted by
inflammatory cartoons and editorials. William McKinley assassinated is the direct vic
tim of a liberty 'perverted and abused into lawless license."
Record Â¦ Union: "How far responsibility attaches to a sensational, vicious, dis
trust-creating and contempt-breeding current literature can be measured by every honest
man who has read the vile assaults and seen the scurrilous cartooning and the malicious
caricaturing of the administrators of national affairs."
Sacramento Bee: "We are Eorry and ashamed, to say that it is not necessary "to
go to other States to find apologists for and applauders of satanic assassination. On the
fifth page of to-day's Bee will be found a statement that W. T. Eaton, walking delegate
of the Building Trades Council of Sacramento, yesterday gloried in the shooting of Presi
dent McKinley, and declared he should have been shot in San Francisco."
Tacoma Ledger: "The San Francisco Call is to be congratulated on its courage
of expression in relation to the strike. No set of men has a right to terrorize a com
munity. When honest laborers are torn from their tasks and beaten almost to death,
the ruffians who are guilty of the act deserve no consideration. Whoever they may be,
the>' are no longer representatives of labor. They deserve to be clubbed by the police
and driven to their holes, and The Call does not hesitate to say so. Nevertheless, the
Examiner stands by the thugs."
Phoenix Republican: "The competition among sensational newspapers has de
veloped a good market .for picturesque lies. The New York Journal and San Francisco
Examiner were the first to recognize that many residents of 'the large cities are credulous
geese, and that by catering to the appetite for the horrible and the wonderful a large cir
culation could be achieved." - ' ' â¢ ' -
Visalia Times: "We heard recently of two San Francisco strikers who were in
this section looking for work. We would like to ask by what right the striker from San
Francisco comes into the interior to seek employment, when he refuses the right of the
man from the country to take the job he has voluntarily quit in the city? It is a mighty
poor rule that won't work both ways. The strikers appeal to the' country press and the
workingmen of the interior to stand by them in their troubles. Then, they come and take
the places of the country workmen, but when the countryman concludes to earn his liv
ing in San Francisco he runs the risk of having his head broken if he accepts the posi
tion left by the striker^ who has crowded him out in the farming section of the State "
Sacramento Bee: "The course of the Examiner in the present labor trouble in
San Francisco is a disgrace to California journalism. It has exerted all of its power, if
not to egg the strikers on to deeds of riot and anarchy, at least to glory in their law
less acts." ... ij
ColllSa Sun: "We were taken all aback when we found the San Francisco Exam
iner had cut us off its exchange list for printing an article. on a public question it could
not answer. We are boycotted, and as in duty bound we feel badly."
Ukiah Times: "A number of the union strikers from San Francisco are in this val
ley and have oTfered to" pick hops for 80 cents per hundred. The price for picking as
fixed by the Hop-Growers' Association is. $1 per hundred, and no one has been asked to
pick for less. If this cheap offer from those who profess to believe in keeping up wages
does not smack of the worst kind of 'scabbing' we don't know what does."

the Chinese crew, who were on a raft, to
pick him up. They refused to do so or
to render him any assistance. Long made
a similar request and met with similar

Henry Long, a survivor of the wreck,

TIGHTENING BAKRIEBS
AGAINST COOLIE LABOR
Treasury Department Orders Deporta-
tion of Twenty-Six Chinese La
borers From This State.
The Treasury Department is tightening
the barriers against the admission of
coolie labor to this country, and almost
every month since the massacre of Chris
tians in China the department has pro
mulgated rulinprs of the most stringent
character against the invasion of yellow
labor.
The latest of these rulings in line with
the policy of the administration was re
ceived yesterday by Customs Collector
Stratton* The case was that of twenty-
Pi x Chinese laborers who came here under
the provisions of the exclusion act of 1SSS.
Before that act was adopted Chinese la
borers returning to China from the ITnited
States must return to the United States,
if at alC within one year after their de
parture. Should they be detained in
China more than a year and less than
two years by reason of sickness or other
unavoidable cause they were required to
obtain from the Chinese Consul at the
port of departure in the United States a
certificate satisfactorily showing the rea
son for such detention. The act of 18SS
rrovided. in :>dcition, that a certificate
showing a similar state of facts should be
obtained from the American Consul at
the Chinese port of departure. The act
was made dependent upon the ratification
cf a treaty that never was ratified.
In a test case the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals decided that the certifi
cation portion of the act was inoperative,
because the treaty upon y.-hich it was de
pendent had never gone into effect. The
Treasury Department holds the contrary
opinion." and the twenty-six coolies must
return to China and obtain from- the
American Consuls at the ports of de
parture the required certificates.

fvoTi Isleton, was robbed of $200 in gold on
tV.e river steamer Apache early yesterday
morning. When the steamer left Isleton
M'iss White came out of her, room to take
a walk on deck. She left her purse, con
taining $200 and some loose silver, lying
on her bed, but remembered it as soon as
she had walked the length of the steam
boat. She rushed back to her room only
to find the purse gone. The matter was
reported to the officers of the Apache ana
a thorough search was made, but without
result. When the steamer reached here
the harbor police were told of the loss and
they are now working on the case.

SAILS FOR PANAMA.
Tfcfc. Meteor left- Baltimore ninety days
ago and on July 9 had to put into Rio de
Jaieiro with her steerage gear damaged.
Repairs were made and on July 29 she was
at the entrance to the Straits of Magellan.
A quick run was made to Point Pillar
and on August 8 the ship Cambrian Prince
from Liverpool for Coquimbo was spoken.
From thence to port, with the exception
ot the sighting of the derelict, the voyage
was uneventful.
A number of wooden vessels are now
on their way south from Pacific Coast
ports. All are lumber laden and it may
be one of them that has met with disaster.
AVhen the Meteor was off Acajutla a
derelict was sighted. Captain Ahlstrom
v/as not on deck at the time and the mate
did not inform, him of the incident until
several hours after the . hulk had been
passed. Chief Officer Reisser, in talking
of the matter yesterday, said: "It was on
August 29 at 10:30 a. m. The Meteor was
in latitude 10 degrees 31 minutes north,
longitude 99 degrees, 33 minutes, 50 seconds
west when a derelict was reported right
ahead. It was awash and about 250 feet
lcrg. Two masts were gone close to the
deck and the stump of the third stuck up
about four feet. It looked like the re
ma'ns of a lumber vessel bound from
Puget Sound to some Chilean port and
must have been in a hurricane. We were
unable to ascertain her name or learn
anything about her."
THE new steam collier Meteor ar
rived from Baltimore yesterday
after a good run of ninety days
from Baltimore. She brings 2600
tons of coal, and after discharging
will probably go into the coast trade.

NEW YORK, Sept. 10,-There was some un
easiness reflected in the stock market to-day
over the money outlook, but it was resisted
with a degree of success and was offset by
other factors, the most notable and effective
of which was the gratifying news of the con
tinued improvement of President McKinley at
Buffalo. The market was artificial to a de
gree, owing to the continued influence of the
precautionary measures put In force after the
attempted assassination of the President on
Friday. These consisted of free buying on
recessions, with the sole purpose of stemming
the tide of reaction and ot the lendlne of
money freely to keep down the rate. While
vigorous support was offered the market on
any signs ot reaction it was also true that
heavy offerings to realize met any advance In
prices. The consequence was a constantly
varying movement up and down, which gave
the market an excessively irregular appear
ance at all times. The closing was heavy and
the extreme advances were much curtailed and
H^n-f 01 " 6 .^ 8 * 8 entireI >' out. Opinions
differ widely as to the effects which would
follow from the proposals of Secretary Gage
for releasing Government funds to the money
mar Â£. et l. U ls tne Â°P inlon that banking circles
would be able to command a sufficient block
or Government bonds to offer to the Secretary
on terms which he can accept to protect the
money market from any real crisis. But It
is to be remembered that the offer -for re
ception of Government bonds at a price fixed
near to the market value which has been
standing since last April has been responded
to for some time past with only a dribble
of small offerings of insignificance on the
money market. The other. part of the Secre
tary s offer, to Increase Government deposits
up to the par value of the Government bonds
lert with the treasury as security, tends to
Increase the disposition to hold the bonds and
thus diminish the offerings. The increase of
Government deposits with the' banks can only
be made out ot future receipts on account of
Internal revenue, which run rather less than
a million dollars a day altogether. While a
possible offset is thus provided against anv
stringency of money that would affect the
commercial transactions of the country there
is some skepticism in the strike market
whether the measure will insure borrowers on
call who hold stocks for speculation against
the calling of loans and forcing of liquidation
to pay the loans. There was a hardening ten
dency of sterling exchange to-day also with
the rather easier rates for money here and
the prospects of additional supplies, which
carried the intimation that it must be a sub
stantial need for money which will bring gold
from abroad. Payments on account of gold
deposited at San Krancisco and Seattle to the
amount of $788,835 were made at the sub
treasury to-day.* while $150,000 was deposited
for transfer to New Orleans. An early rumor
of an extra dividend on St. Paul this week
and a later one of a settlement of the steel
strike were used with effect to support the
market, ths stocks most immediately affected
leading the advance on each occasion. The
Pacifies, Amalgamated Copper and a number
of the Junior Vanderbllts and minor railroad
stocks were also advanced sharply.
Railroad bonds were only moderately active
and firm. Total sales, par value, $1,640,000. '
United States bonds and the new 4s cdvanced

Man report* from New York say: "All hopes
of doing any further early business In new
crop California raisins in this or any other
market are unquestionably effectually knocked
out by President Kearney's threat that the
directorate of the Raisin Growers' Association
will mash the market In California to 2c in
the sweatbox. Whether Mr. Kearney or the
directors of the combine would be able to
carry out the threat 1b by no means certain,
but nevertheless the whole raisin situation at
present is about as bad as it well could be,
and In the face of existing circumstances no
buyer is likely to buy a pound of new raisins.
The spot market shows little or no change,
stocks here being still light and prices well
maintained in consequence.

that which he may manage to save out

Therefore we again come to you to ask you

T^cauee he is a menace to the public safety

tiality which his office demands. We ask you
to pass a resolution that the Chief of Police
be warned to moderate his pernicious activity
and be instructed that his duty Is to repress
crime, not to provoke w. We ask ypu to
pass a resolution that the place of the police
is on the streets, not on the wagons. Let it
be granted lor a moment that the wagons
would provoke a riot if not so guarded. This
we know is not true, but let it be granted.
Now it is a well known maxim of government
that acts which are leg-al in ordinary clrcum-
Etances become illegal when in an excited con
dition of the public mind they might cause
disturbance. If the wagons cause disturbance
It is the fault of the Employers' Association.
The remedy is not to put police on the
wagons, but to pur police at the doors of the
barns to prevent the .wagons from coming
out. The owners have .no .special privileges.

enough justice, for the employers.
We ask you to pass a resolution to disband
the Hessians that Chief Sullivan has collected
under the name of special policemen. They
are dissolute and sbandoned characters who
have caused more disturbance than all the
other elements of .the city combined. They
are a menace to the community. Peaceful citi
zens, aye, innocent school children, are Insulted
and intimidated by them. We ask you to sup
press them and remove from our midst a can
cer that threatens to corrupt and destroy our
city. . ' . Â¦ â¢
Lastly we ask you. to proclaim to. the world
that never ' have men behaved themselves so
well under such provocation as the men locked
out of work .in San Francisco. The city has
been absolutely peaceful. Unfriendly journals
have searched the city with lamps for as
saults and outrag-es, and they have sought in

. SALT.JLAKE CITY, ; Sept. 10.â The two
story brick building extending from 212 to
222 South West Temple street, In which
were located the general offices of- the
Oregon - Short Line Railway, . Â¦ was de
stroyed by fire early this morning.
The fire originated in the basement of
the Mine and Smelter- Supply, Company,
occupying the west half of the ground
floor. .Shortly after the firemen arrived
an explosion of dynamite, a small quan
tity of which was stored in the basement,
blew out most of the south wall and part
of the front of the building, four firemen
being cut by flying glass. Assistant Chief
McCarthy was severely injured.
The explosion wrecked the vault in the
chief engineer's" office of the' Short Line
Railway, and nearly all the records of
the road, including the plans of the new
Salt Lake-Los Angeles extension, were
lost. . - .
For a time the six-story Dooley block,
to the north, and the new high school
building: adjoining on the west were in
danger of destruction,- but the fire was
finally got under control with but slight
damage to those buildings. The loss will
probably approximate $250,000. The Ore
gon Short Line offices will be moved into
the Dooley block temporarily.
It would be difficult for any one outside
of the Short Line Company to estimate
what was lost in to-day's fire. It> had
many very, valuable' records stored in the
different parts of the destroyed building
upon which no money value could be
placed^';' They were records of the com
pany from its beginning â records which
represented the company's entire history
and holdings. There is no insurance or
money equivalent which can replace these.
â¢What difference their, loss will make to
the railroad, its officers do not care to
discuss..

Gold is coming into Nome from Teller
and from Gold Run. A peculiar feature
about the latter place is the fact that
the large amount of claim-jumping and
disputes during the early part of the sea

owners and they said nothing of the
richness of their property. Now, how
ever, this richness is beginning to man
ifest itself in the season's yield.
Gold is beginning to come into Nome
at :a good rate, and all indications are
that the .next ships returning to pprt

treasure. The Centennial brought $250,

$65,000 belongs to the Wild Goose Mining

The reason Postum builds up the human
body to. a prime condition of health, is
that when coffee is left off the drug
effects of the poison disappear and the
elements in Pootum unite with albumen
cJf the food to make gray matter and re-
ftfj the delicate nerve centers all over the
body and in the -brain; This sots up a
perfect condition of nerve health, and
the result Is that the entire bedy feels
the effect cf it. â¢ .
"When I began to drink Postum, my
muscles were flabby, as my habits are
sedentary, but for the past .two years my
muscles Jjave been hard and I never x felt
stronger' in my life than I do now at
sixty yeWs of age. and I attribute. my
strength' cf muscle to constant use, of
Postum. I drink it three times a day. I
feel so enthusiastic about Postum that
I cannot recommend It too highly wher-
ever I go. Wishing you great success,
yours truly." â¢ Rev. A. P. Moore, 474
Rhode Island st., Buffalo, N. Y.
"I have been eo well pleased with it and
its healthful effects that I have used it
ever since. I carry packages with me
when I visit other places.
"For years I havs not been able to
drink coffee, as it made me very nervous
and gave me a headache. No one loved
coffee more than I, and it was a severe
trial to abandon its use. Nearly three
years ago I saw Postum Cereal Coffee ad-
vertised and concluded to try it.

Mrs. Hearst's offer to the regents was
made in a modest way. She arrived at the
meeting while President Benjamin I.
Wheeler Â¦wras reading his report, and at
the close of the reading" she motioned to
him to make another report to the
regents. This he seemed reluctant to do,
and reauested her to address the board.
She declined to do so, wliereupon Presi
dent Wheeler said that he would have
preferred Mrs. Hearst to make the offer,
but, as she had requested him to do it, he
would gladly perform the pleasant task.
He said that anthropological specimens
Â¦were arriving at the university every day
and that Mrs. Hearst had suggested to
him that a department of â¢ anthropologv
was sadly needed. She at the same time
informed him that she woifld be only too
glad to defray the expenses. of the depart
ment- President Wheeler added that Mrs.
Hearst suggested that the department
be governed by an honorarv advisory com
mittee composed of the xollowing mem
bers:

Several members of the advisory com
mittee met recently, the president 'said, at
.Mrs. Hearst s residence and plans were
outlined for furthering the work of the
department of anthropology. Among the
suggestions made were that Dr. Kroeber
be paid a salary cf $1200 -a year and be
allowed a sum not exceeding J1SOO for one
year for expenses and the purchase of

A number of changes wore ma<de in the
faculty, and the report tiled showed a
large Increase in the number of students.
Tne question of charging tuition fees for
students living outsi&e California was
passed to the next meeting of the board,
which takes place the second Tuesday of
next month.
At the quarterly meeting of Hhe regents
of the University; of CaHfornia, held yes
terday afternoon,' Mrs. Phebe Hearst, in
her quiet and modest manner, stated that
she thought the university would be
greatly benefited by the 'establishment of
a department of anthropology, aind added
that she would gladiy pay the annual
expenses of the department. The expenses
will amount to fully. $50,000 a year. Her
generous ofter was accepted by the board.

In many respects Martin Kelly is an
abler, boss than the colonel, but in owlish
silence â the quiet -assumption of superior
knowledge of inside affairsâ Kelly is out
classed by his fellow boss. When it comes
to ringing oratory, or the smashing, of
ballot-boxes with a battle-ax, the veteran
statesman of the Twenty-eighthâ the rude,
unpolished boss of the roundersâ can give
the colonel points.. It is time for Kelly to
introduce something to divert the atten
tion of delegates and amuse the - spec
tators of the political contest. .Here is
the colonel, without the support of a
single delegation, acting, for all the world
as â¢ if he owned the whole works, while
the boss of the Twenty-eighth, with, a
string of sixty delegates, is afraid to name
his choice for chairman of the convention.
Boss Kelly may. be compelled .by the
peculiar -exigencies of the. campaign ' and
the obvious lack of vigorous leadership to
hire an office in a.tall building, employ. a
corps of messengers and accord Interviews
to men who are not candidates. .
Kelly Is. Thrown in the Shade.
Blank emerges from i the precincts of
wisdom and mingles in the world of com
mon . knowledge. As soon as" he. meets
his political supporters he tells, them that
it is all offâ that Tom Jones ls^ slated for
Recorder. The word is passed along the
line, the delegates hear it and being
anxious to back winners tumble into
Jones' camp. Â¦ ; Â¦ .
Blank replies, assenting to the postpone
ment, but wondering if the colonel -will
not distribute too much of the patronage
before >the interview takes place. Next
day the appointment is kept. The colonel
is urbane and affable, but in no sense
voluble. It is a trick of the colonel's to
look wise and say little. Still, he greets
Blank with silent warmth and promises
to feel the delegates and send for him.
When Blank retires the colonel, in the
vast depths of his profound wisdom, de
cides to send forth messengers to ascer
tain something about the real candidates
for Recorder, for example. In due time
the messenger returns and tells the,col
onel that Tom Jones is making a good
tight. for the place, has many delegates
pledged and stands the best chance of
winning. Thereupon Blank is advised to
see the colonel again. At the appointed
time Â¦ another interview takes place. The
colonel, looking wiser than the wisest
of sacred owls, savs: "The- convention
will meet on the 16th. but- will do noth
ing more than organize. . It will adjourn
for two weeks. Now, about the nomina
tion for Recorder. I am sorry Â¦ that I
cannot give it to you. Personally you
are my choice, but after feeling the del
egates and ascertaining their wishes and
estimating the force of their suggestions
I conclude that Tom Jones ought to have
that nomination. Don't be a hard loser,
but- stand in with the boys for Jones and
you will be recognized.'.' ' ........
Where the Colonel Looks Wise.
Blank is assured that his chances are
as good as those of anybody else, and the
hint is out that he ought to see
the "colonel." The suggestion that he
ought to see the colonel is conveyed as
something profoundly important, i^inally
the messenger -agrees to bring about an
interview with the colonel and the time, is
fixed for "Thursday afternoon at 3 o'clock
in the" colonel's office." .. At Sacramento
everything was predicted to happen
"next Thursday," but despite Daniel and
all the rest of the prophets nothing hap
pened according â¢ to prrophecy. However,
Blank prepares to meet his colonel at the
appointed time, . but before the hour
named the colonel calls him. up by
"phone." The colonel says: - "I am sorry,
but I will not be able to keep my engage
ment with you at 3 o'clock to-day. I. was
detained much longer than I expected to
be by other parties. Would it be con
venient to defer our interview until to
morrow, say 3 o'clock?". .
The new game as played by the colonel
is a clever oneâ really cleverer, than any
thing he introduced at Sacramento, bar
ring the Cosper trick. It is played in this
fashion: The colonel knows blank as a
good fellow, popular and ambitious to
hold office. -He knows also that Blank
has not the. ghost of a chance to get a
nomination,- yet he sends Eddie Conroy
or some other- messenger to make a
sounding. Â¦ Blank â¢ is ' approached . with a
suggestion that he ought to get in the
race for Recorder, for instance. Blank
listens and responds: "Oh, vhere is no
show for me. I am not in politics for of
flee, and if I; wanted - a. nomination.- Â¦ I
couldn't get it."
Burns 'Is Playing a Hew Game.
Colonel Dan Burns appreciates the sit
uation and is now doing local politics in
a style that Â¦ creates .infinite amusement
for, those who are on the inside. There is
not* a -.delegation in the- convention â¢ that
he can control in the manner that Martin
Kelly can control the Twenty-eighth and
Twenty-ninth District bunches, but he
can assume such a mysterious knowledge
of i the situation that many of the dele
gates . and. several of the candidates are
persuaded to the notion that a word from
his lips will settle Â¦ an aspirant's fate.
The delegates who were chosen at the
primary, election August 13 are still wait
ing and wonderingâ waiting for some pro
gramme to be presented and ' wondering
if, a leader has. been ", found. .There have
been several conferences and many indi
vidual exchanges of sentiment regarding
organization and line of action,-, but the
element- of leadership seems to be lack
ing in every delegation. The failure or
neglect of delegates to take hold of af
fairs,for themselves is giving the bosses
just such an opportunity as the shrewd
political manipulator desires.

Convention who are not inclined to sup
