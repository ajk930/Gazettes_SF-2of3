returned from marketing his wheat in
the little town of Maxwell. A bullet had
gone through her head, life was extinct
and her two baby children were crying
alone In their grief and fear. The oldest
boy, aged 5, told what had occurred. The
young mother had been shot and killed by
Henry Noles, a negro hand on the Wil
liams' place. As the mortally wounded
woman sank to the floor Noles shot at
the boy. the bullet grazing the child's
head. Then he fled to the woods. The mo

instantly the quivering body was en

about the burning body and soon life was
extinct. The negro made no outcry at
any time and died as stolidly as a stoic.
There â¢were no disorderly scenes about
the burning body. At least 6000 per

negro. Many remained until nightfall,
augmenting the blaze until the body was
entirely consumed. Then they departed
for their homes quietly.

"I just done that because I had noth

"Tell all my sisters and brothers to

PHOENIX, Ariz.. Aug. . 25.â The arrest
here -yesterday of William M. Koey, cus
toms collector at Nogales, and that at
Tucson of B. F. Josey. Chinese Inspector,
charged with implication In the schema
for' smuggling Chinese from Mexico into
the United States, continues to eyeate a
tremendous sensation. For ; a long time
it has been known that secret service men
under orders of the Treasury Department
were Investigating wholesale smuggling
of Orientals, but Hoey and Josey appar
ently have been the most active In the
efforts to slop the practice. It is charged
that they had an arrangement with sev
eral Chinee to let contraband Celestials
come over the border at a rate rangmj?
from $50 to $500 each. The highest price
was paid fcr girls, who were provided for
sale to wealthy Chinese. Several girls had
been captured recently, but It Is believed
that hundreds of them have been 3ecretly
fcrought in. â¢ - .
Recently, as a means of decreasing the
Influx of Chinese from Mexico, the depart
l.ient has refused to allow Chinese bound
for 1 that country to land at San Fran
cisco and other ports and go overland* to
Mexico* unles's absolutely satisfied that
they intended to remain In Mexico. None
of those who passed through the United
States In transit to Mexico stopped off
before crossing the border. The railroads
carrying \ them were compelled to give
bend, and In consequence every train
carrying Chinese . to Mexico carried
guards, and the Chinese were always de
livered on the Mexican side of the fron
tier. Most- of. them speedily got hack Into
the United States, however.
It Is hoped by Treasury officials that the
unearthing of this conspiracy will pat a
stop to most of the smuggling of Chinese
across the Mexican border which has been
going: on for several years. . The depart
mejit. : ,has, knpwii, that Chinese were get
ting across, but it was not supposed that
the ..very men relied upon to keep them
out were helping them to come'lnV- It was
supposed that. they eluded; the officials
along the long, and thinly settled frontier.

W., WASHINGTON. Ausr. 23.â Further
arrests on account of the smuggling of
Chinese across the Mexican 'border are
expected to be made to-morrow. Secret
service officers who are at work on the
case report that they expect to have evi
dence sufficient to justify the arrest of
several more officers of the Chinese In
spection service, but the Treasury Depart
ment will not give the names of the sus
pected officers â¢ In advance of the arrests
being made. In the case of at least" one
high' official, secret service men report
that they are fully satisfied that he Is
Implicated, \ but they have not yet
obtained evidence that would justify them
in making his arrest. The conspiracy In

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 25.â At an early
hour this morning Police !Detect!ves
Fisher and Fitzgerald arrested Harry
Hammel, alias Harry Homer, who is said
to be one of the most dangerous criminals
in the State. Hammel is a safe-blower,
and a charge has been placed against him
of having shattered the vault, doors of
Holbrook, Merrill & Stetson's establish
ment In this city Sunday night last and
getting away with $226. â -
Hammel was released May 13 from a oi
som Prison, after having served a five
year term for burglary committed in Los
Angeles. While in the prison he became
the companion of a safe-cracker, and he
was not long out when he began to utilize
the knowledge he had gained. â,"â.,
On July 19 he attempted to blow *>Ven
the railroad office safe at San Mateo, but
failed. On August 1 Hammel succeeded
in blowing open the safe at the Meplo
Park Postofflce, securing J243 in cash and
I19S in postage stampg. Next he cracked
the safe of the Antioch Lumber Com
pany at Antioch and got away with some
Coming northward from the scene ot
these exploits. Hammel went into seclu
sion in. Washington, Yolo County, Just
across the river from Sacramento.
Thomas Norton's saloon in this city was
burglarized, and, suspecting Hammel,
Chief of Police Sullivan requested
Washington Constable to arrest him- The
evidence against him waa not complete,
however, and he was discharged.
The robbery of the Menlo' Park Postof
fice was of a sensational character. Tne
explosion oT file* safe ' 'awakened Mrs.
Doane, living' over : the.tpostomce. She
aroused Deputy ; Postmaster George
Weller, who secured the aid of a neigh
boring hotel cleric- and together they -pro
ceeded to investigate the cause of Mrs.
Doane's alarm.
Opening the postofflce door they found
the room filled with, smoke. The robber,
pistol In' hand, ordered them ! to stand
back. Weller grabbed at the pistol and
the robber soupht to discharge it, but the
hammer was stopped by Weller's thumb.
The robber broke away from his captor s
grasp and, keeping his pistol leveled at
the two men, backed out and made his
escape.
The police and detectives this afternoon
discovered a safe-breaking outfit in an
alley here, where Hammel Is thought to
have planted it. It contained drills, dyna
mite and an electrical apparatus. Hammel
was coming out of this alley when ar
rested this morning. On his person were
a. loaded revolver and some dynamite
cartridges.
Detective Fisher to-night said there was
no question that- Hammel was the man
who committed the San Mateo County
robberies. After the Holbrook, Merrill &
Stetson robbery. Fisher visited San Mateo
Cwunty, and In company with Under Sher
iff Henry. Bucks called on all the parties
who had seen the robber^ and obtained
from them descriptions which fitted Ham
mel perfectly. Detective Fisher had a
photograph of Hammel with a number of
others. He asked the parties to select the
man, and they all picked out" Hammel'3
picture. Â¦ ' ; ,
i Among those who thus positively Identi
fied Hammel was Deputy Postmaster
George Weller and Hotel Clerk Thomas
Burns, who had the face-to-face adventure
with him in the San Mateo postofflce. City
Marshal Wallace saw a man hastily leav
ing the town just after the robbery, and
before he had been informed of It, and he
recognized this man In the picture shown
lilm of Hammel. A milkman who saw the
robber escaping also Identified him in the
same manner. The detective claims that
"he has all of -Hammers movements traced
up to the present. His room here has
Tjeen searched and further Incriminating
evidence 'found, including revenue stamps
of the number and denomination stolen
ftpm the Holbrook, 'Merrill & Stetson
safe, and putty such as was used in* the
safe-cracking. Hammel declines to make
any statement.

Speaking of the general strike situation,
Andrew Furusetb, secretary of the Sail
ors' Union, said yesterday:
"We enter upon the sixth week of the
teamsters' strike and the fifth week of the
reneral strike as strong and determined
as the day we went out. As to the results
we have accomplished, conditions along
the water front and in the wholesale dis
trict speak for themselves."
"Have you accomplished as. much as you
hoped for in that time?" was asked him.
"No, I would not say that. We had
hoped for early peace, of course. But it
takes two to make a bargain. The - em
ployers will not treat with us. That set
tles it. There is no other course but to
continue the struggle and put up the best
fight possible to us."

SHOTS FIBED AT PICKETS.
"Water Front.
Several Small Bdots Occur on the
Very little work was done on the water
front yesterday. The day was one of rest
for every one but the pickets placed by
the unions along the wharves. They were
as vigilant as ever- and allowed no oppor
tunity to pass whereby they might bene
fit their cause. Only two non-union men
were treated at the Harbor Hospital dur
ing the entire day, and neither of them
were badly injured.
â¢ The injured stevedores were colored men
â¢who have been boarding on the Ohio.
They had been ashore overnight and when
they went to the front yesterday morning
to get aboard the vessel they were stopped
by the pickets, who sought to prevent
their reaching - the floating - boarding
house. E. S. James, one of the colored
men, drew a revolver and 'fired two shots
into the crowd of pickets, and his compan
ion, whose name is Henry Boose, assault
ed the union men with his fists.
A small riot ensued, out of which the
negroes came badly bruised. None of the
union men were hurt. While the fight was
in progress the police arrived and arrest
ed the whole crowd. James was charged
with discharging a weapon inside the city
limits and the pickets and Boose were
charged with disturbing the peace.
Albert Schiaber, a 'longrshoremari, was
arrested at the corner of Davis and Jack
feon streets yesterday afternoon for dis
charging a pistol on East street. Schiaber
Indulged in a little too much water front
Â¦whisky during the day and thought the
only proper â¢way to show his sympathy
Â¦with the strikers was to indulge in a
mimic Fourth of July celebration,- He had
fired but one shot when the police arrest
ed him.
A number of union men made a raid on
the restaurant kept by .Frank O. Mello
at 116 Jackson street yesterday afternoon
and completely wrecked the place. Mello
lias been furnishing meals to the non
union firemen employed along the front
and incurred the enmity of the strikers by
continuing to do so after he had been
Â¦warned against it. The men who did the
wrecking entered the place and without

be insecure. With general land laws ap

Clark some months ago put himself on
record as an aspirant for renomlnatlon at
the hands of the regular Republican con
vention, and declared that he would not
become an Independent candidate. But,
while be has' declined to discuss the ques
tion of late, his supporters declare there
Is no doubt that he will become an inde
pendent candidate should he find it useless
to put up a fight to elect a majority of
his delegates at. the primary. The action
of the Central Committee In having two
blanket tickets, one In each Assembly
District, Is regarded as a shrewd forestall
ing of Clark, since the latter could un
doubtedly make a hard fight if the elec
tion were conducted In nine clearly de
fined wards.
That he has tron the enmity of Colonel
J. B. Wright and the other Republican
powers is no longer a matter of doubt.
The Republican Central Committee has.
In accordance with the evident Intention
to Ehut Clark out from renominatlon, de
cided to apportion Its delegates to the
convention by the two Assembly Dis
tricts embraced by the city, instead of by
the nine ward boundaries. It is no secret
that this apportionment is made for no
other purpose than to render more diffi

course, include the present administration

It is rather an interesting fact that
while Colonel J. B. Wright has been
deposed as the Southern Pacific division

city that he is still rendering the company

the retirement of President Hays, it will
be only a matter of time when he will be

LONDON. Aug. 26.â "Li Hung Chang
has notified the Ministers of the powers."
says a dispatch to the Times from Peking
dated yesterday, "that edicts necessary to
the signing of the protocol by the Chi
nese plenipotentiaries are now en route
from Sian-Fu and are expected to arrive
here Wednesday."
It has been reported that the conferees
disapproved the move in abrogating the
Federal Steel Company contracts and told
President Shaffer so with unmistakable
emphasis. .Of this, however. . Secretary
John Williams said to-day that during the
conference he had heard no adverse criti
cism by the Civic Federation conferees
on the attitude of President Shaffer in
this matter of contracts. ; .
The action of President Shaffer in abro
gating the wage contracts with the Fed
eral Steel Company, covering Its Western
mills and in other instances, was ques
tioned. Messrs; Mitchell, White and Jenks
spoke of the importance of strict observ
ance of wage agreements as contracts by
the labor unions. President Shaffer, main
tained his position, to the satisfaction of
most of the conferees.
Shaffer's Action Questioned.
In furtherance of- the "peace", pro
gramme, which is said .to have been in
the course of preparation for several
days, It was given out to-day by one. on
the Inside and one who should know, that
the Amalgamated executives have con
sented to have certain propositions made
to the officials of the United States Steel
Corporation through members of the con
ciliatory committee of the National Civic
Federation, which proposals are expected
to bring about a settlement of the great
strike. Those Interested in the matter
were in waiting all day for word to pro
ceed with the programme as outlined at
the conference of Amalgamated -execu
tives and the conciliatory committee of
the Civic Federation last Friday.
The propositions which are to be taken
to New York carry certain conditions by
the Amalgamated Association which it is
hoped will pave the way for the reopening
of direct negotiations between the asso
ciation and the company. The proposition
carries . much of the terms under which
President Shaffer and his advisers stand
willing to settle. !
What these terms are and the mode of
their presentation are carefully guarded
secrets. There ' is alone the Implication
that they contain concessions of such im
portance that those in interest expect the
corporation to drop its adverse attitude
and reopen negotiations.
The proposal contains nothing: looking
to arbitration. This mode of settlement
was waived on the. ad vice of the Civic
Federation men.
While the conferees were discussing"
plans the Amalgamated men were shown
the impracticability of sympathetic
strikes by the miners and other organized
men affiliated with the American Federa
tion of Labor.
Further Peace Proposals.
Everything at McKeesport is reported
quiet. Pickets are around the Demmler
tin plate mill in large- numbers, but they
are orderly and are determined to be on
hand all night, as they believed an at
tempt would be made to start the plant
in the morning. While the fires are light
ed-and the mill apparently * in' readiness
for~a-start, the officials will not say just
when the attempt will be made.'
" When the strikers were told of the
claims of- the Â¦officials of the' Star, mills
they denied that there were as many
skilled men at work as was claimed, and
said those who were In the plant were
sent there from the Monessen plant,
which was being crippled in order to ac
complish this work. Strenuous denials
were also made regarding alleged deser
tions from the Amalgamated ranks to fill
the positions offered â¢fey the corporation,
and it was said that it would.be impossi
ble to' obtain men enough to operate * the
. plant without settllpg ,the strike. .^ , Â¦-.' â
' Therd was no change j In the 61 tuatlon
regarding the tube mills to-day. Former
employes remained away from the plants.
It Is understood that the officials of the
National Tube Company . have practically
determined not to start these plants for
the present.
Outside of the Star plant to-day a large
number of strikers were on picket duty,
They were quiet and orderly but had theii
eyes and ears open for any signs of new
comers, p The peculiar ' feature - of thÂ«
strike about the Star plant is the goo<3
feeling displayed between the strikers and
the manager of the plant.
this morning. J..R. Phlllpps of the com
pany accompanied them to the mill, and
It was not until after they, were In and
comfortably .settled for the night that
the strikers discovered their presence.
Those men are of the best In the trade
and will enable us to move -the plant on
a better basis than before."
"We received eight skilled men earl
With the completion of these improve
ments the company will be prepared to
place a sufficient number of men in the"
plant to work the four double mills, three
full turns. This is said to be expected to
take place during the present week. Be
fore SaturdaV, according to Superintend
ent Piper of the Star mills, the plant will
be operated to its full extent. Referring
to the present .condition of the mills Mr.
Piper said:
Skilled Workmen Smuggled In.
The mo3t interesting situation Is in the
Star, mill of the American Tinplate Com
pany here. This plant was until this sum
mer considered as doomed. The Tin Plate
Company had, it is said, decided to aban
don the mill and move the machinery
elsewhere. Since; the strike has come
upon them, and it was demonstrated that
the operation of the mill with non-union

this plan has been carried out during the

mills have been changed to four double

week that will alter the aspect of affairs
considerably if carried out. It was said
on good authority to-day that before the
end of the. week those plants that have
been operating on single turn would be
run will full force and for the usual three
full turns each day. . Men enough have
been engaged for this purpose, the offi

strikers that the companies could not get
enough men to operate their , plants, and

they will be ready with air the skilled men

. CHICAGO, Aug. 23. â The only visible
result of the mass meeting of * trades
unionists and sympathizers held in South
Chicago to-day was the declaration of one
skilled worker, that he would not again
enter the mill until the strike was settled.
The steel workers, whom the meeting was
designed- to report, were not present in
appreciable- numbers.
Assistant Scretary Tighe of the Amal
gamated Association was the principal
speaker and denounced former members
of the association in South Chicago, "for
deserting their union under the guise of
living up to a contract." . , â¢
Tighe contends that the contract of the
steel workers has been rendered nugatory
by the encroachments of the steel trust,
and that it was the duty of the Chicago
steel workers to join their fellow unionists
in the East, in a battle where, he said,
the very existence of the Amalgamated
Association was at stake.-

DOVER, Ens., Aug. 25.â Mr. Hol
bein, who yesterday, the anniver
sary of Captain Webb's swim
from Dover to . Calais, started
from Cape Gris-Nez (between
Boulogne-Sur-Mer and Calais) in an at
tempt to swim to Dover, narrowly es
caped drowning. He covered the course
to a point within six miles of Dover and
then collapsed after having been in the
water twelve hours and forty-six min
utes. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ . 'Â¦
The tug which accompanied him took
him from the water and brought him. to
Dover this morning. He was carried to
a hotel in a semi-conscious, precarious
state, and subsequently, on the advice of
his medical attendants, was removed to
a- hospital, where he lay for some time in
a serious condition. It was found that h*s
eyesight had been badly affected by the
DENOUNCED FOR DESERTION.
Instructions to Holbein were shouted

His exploit was very remarkable, con
sidering the roughness of the sea, and
has established a record. He found it
impossible to take solid food and sub
sisted mainly on raw eggs. He also took
hot milk from a feeding bottle. He swam
with a powerful stroke, alternately on
his -back and on his breast, making a
good pace. The first six miles from Cape
Gris-Nez were covered in two hours and
rtwenty-flve minutes. Much of the time
he swam with his eyes closed, owing to
the irritating effects of the salt water.

recovered and announced his intention to
renew the attempt.
After 11 o'clock he was once lost for
five minutes, a big wave having swept
over him. He kept going steadily, but
during the tenth and eleventh hours a
westerly tide drifted him much out of his
course and It was evident that the heavy
seas were having a bad effect.
During the twelfth hour his stroka
weakened considerably, and he seemed
unable to grasp the directions given him.
Twice he turned completely around.
At 4:20 a. m. it was decided to take him
out of the -water. He was turning like a
top. and hopelessly blind.
Allowing for his zigzag course, it is es

The general inactivity in business led^us to believe th it our workshops j
I had produced more than we could sell. We accordingly started a sale to dis-
pose of goods regardless of prof its. j
We have relieved the pressureâ the sales in the past three week > hive
enabled us to keep ahead of our workshops. We have disposed of considerable
clothingâ the store has been well crowded right along. But, why shouldn't i ?
When we deliberately reduce good, up-to-date clothing and guarantee it with ;
a money-back proposition the public is quick to take advantage of such values. :
Since the sales have been so extensive and the stock has been materially
reduced the sale will end nex 1 Sa'urday night at n o'clock. Until then you can
get good, all-wool *uits at ST.85 which were $12 50 and $15.00; well-made
j top coats at $6.45 which were #10.00; durable trousers at $1.85 which |
were $$.00. They are union-made clothes from our own workshops. \

speaking of the present price) you can have your money back without a

The scarcity of platinum la beginning to
cause some concern among the electrical
manufacturers of the country. For about
five years the price of this valuable metal
has steadily risen, until to-day it is listed
at a higher price than ever since its dis
covery, and every indication points to still
higher prices. Platinum I3 now quoted at
about $36 an ounce, about twice the quo
tation of gold, while five years apo it sold
as low as $5 an ounce. Since the flooding
of the * platinum mines in the Transvaal,
which occurred after the breaking out of
the Boer war, manufacturers have had to
rely on Siberia fcr their supply of the
valuable metal. Some little hope was
held out that platinum would be found in
Alaska and other northern mining coun
tries, but no such discoveries have been
made. ;.. .

The truth. might partly be found in the
fact that. the big stores are not getting as
much American money as in previous sea
sons.,. Visitors; from the United States
seem to have grown wise as to the exor
bitant tactics of the swell London shop
keepers, and refuse to be swindled.
"American l shoppers, however, have a
warm champion in "Dagonet" (George R.
Sims), who in the Referee says the fault
is; that the British shopkeepers are not
educated to American methods. With
tact," he says,' they, could | do more busi
ness with an American in half an hour
than. with an Englishman in half a year.

It is charged that the valuable time of
high-priced salesmen is thus wasted, and
that many of the Bond-street and Regent
street stores have lost much of their best
English custom because of the unprofit
able exactions of American women.
Its appearance led to investigations by
the newspapers, which are filled with
amusing comments on what is called the
"gall" of American shoppers, who, it is
alleged, spend hours in the great stores
examining and pricing everything, but
buying nothing. ,

The Virginia constitutional convention has under
consideration a clause providing that when a divorce
is granted for cruelty or for any other act which is a
violation^ of law it shall be the duty of the proper

the effect of putting an end to a good deal of false
swearing in the way of getting divorces.
Â¦ An English entomologist. William Wat
kins, was the first to raise butterflies on a
large scale. For a dozen years the estab

here flutter at liberty many thousands of,
butterflies of various species.
From all the countries of the world the
farm receives eggs, which are submitted
to a special mode of Incubation. Then the
caterpillars, issuing from these eggs, re

A CHANCE TO SMILE
With such reports coming from Russia it is pleas
ing to learn that the Indian situation is much im
proved. Just before Parliament adjourned Lord
George Hamilton, Secretary for India, presented the
financial statement of that portion of the empire, and
in doing so stated that in spite of three years of fam
ine and acute depression in the three agricultural
staples, tea, indigo and cotton, he was able to pre
sent the most favorable balance-sheet since India
came under the crown. The relief expenditures for
three years totaled Â£15,000,000, but the same period
showed a surplus of. Â£6.377,000. The season's rains,
though below normal, have been sufficient for agri
cultural purposes. . Th-* crop outlook is fair, and there
is a prospect of a material reduction in the relief ex
penditure^ 4 Â¦Â¦: 'Â¦'.Â£ :â¢';
There seems no reason v to doubt that there is
produced every year an ample supply of food for the
whole human. race if only it could be properly . and
economically distributed. Means to that end are
It is the lack of transportation which makes. the
situation so appalling. Russia, is so large a country
that there are always some portions of Her territory
that have good crops. It has, however, happened in
the past that while the provinces near the sea have
had wheat to ship to other lands, thousands of people
in the interior were dying for lack of the food that
was being sent out of the country.
It will be seen that the severity of this extraor
dinary summer which blighted the fields of our. East
ern States was as nothing in comparison to that
which has been experienced by the Russian farmer.
Moreover, in the United States there were such
abundant harvests in the States that were * not af
fected by the hot wave, and the means of transporta
tion are so abundant, that in this country there was
no suggestion of famine .or even of temporary dis
tress among any considerable number of people. The
Russians, however, are said to face a condition which
will mean starvation for thousands. It is true the
Siberian wheat crop is reported good, but it will be
difficult to get the grain to the people of the stricken
provinces at prices they can afford to pay, and the
consequence is the Russian Government will have to
enter upon a" sysfem of wholesale relief.
' Advices from Moscow are to the effect that nearly
one-third of all the provinces of European Russia
have been officially declared to have produced an in
sufficient crop of cereals. . In only two provinces out
of seventy have there been really good harvests. The
report goes on to say: "The official 'insufficient'
means utter starvation. The famine-stricken area
exceeds half a million square miles, twice the area
of France and about the same area as that of the
great famine in 1891. The population numbers
43,000,000. The hopes founded on the reports of two
months ago have vanished. The havoc has been
wrought by the intense heat and entire absence -of
rain when needed. Afterward there were torrential
downpours and hailstorms. The appearance of in
numerable pests is completing the destruction. As
the harvest is now in progress, these are final re
ports."
BETWEEN Russia and India there seems to be
something in the way of a regular alternation
of famine years. When there are good sea
sons in the one there are bad seasons in the other. In
dia has just gone through-a period of direful famine,
and now that she is recovering there come reports
that over large parts of Russia there is likely to be
this year a distress that will be almost as serious.
/ ANOTHER FAMINE -IN SIGHT.
In our local markets conditions remain unchanged.
The leading feature i< the sharp and continuous de
mand for many lines of fruits and vegetables to sup
ply the shortage in the West and Southwest. The
demand for potatoes lias been enormous, while that
for dried fruits has been the largest for years, and
shows no signs of lessening. This is a great year Tor
California products of almost all descriptions, and
irade is feeling the beneficial effects thereof. Wine
and wine grapes are opening the new season at high
prices, with a first-class demand. Provisions rule
firm, and the movement is sufficient to keep stocks
down to a moderate point. >Wherever one turns he
finds the same reports of an active demand for most
kinds of merchandise, with prices firm, credits exr
cellent and collections easy, except in certain city
districts, where the strike, by throwing many workers
out of employment, has more or less affected the re
tail trade. But on ihe whole the city is doing its
usual business.
All these favorable conditions affect the country's
bank clearings, which showed a gain of 34.7 per cent
last week over the corresponding week last year, Min
neapolis and St. Paul being the only. important cities
to report a decrease. The failures were more numer
ous than last year, being 205, against 171, but they
were small and without especial significance. Wall
street continued dull and featureless, trading being
narrow and mainly confined to the professionals, as
the public are not much in the market at present.
There is no pressure to sell, however, and in fact
offerings of good securities are light, while there is a
steady dcmarftl for sound dividend-paying stocks and
bonds. Operators have generally abandoned the bear
side of thr market and are "going long," especially
on railroad shares, as the damage to the crops in the
West and Southwest has been discounted and the
railroads continue to report large earnings:
The leading staples are all firm as a rule. Raw
wool is buoyant, with manufacturers buying and the
dip pretty well cleaned out of first hands. Woolen
goods sympathize, and the mills are fully employed
on fall orders, while liberal engagements are being
booked for the spring trade. Cotton fabrics are
steady, though the first-hand market is not active.
The iron and steel trades, notwithstanding the strike,
arc reported in good shape, and at some points, no
tably Chicago, the jobbers are said to have more or
ders than they can fill. Lumber is firm, and stocks
arc kept down to moderate proportions by a steady
building demand. Leather is firm, and exceptional
activity is reported among the boot and shoe facto
ries, the latter bidding fair to continue for. some
months yet. A good feature of this trade is that very
small summer stocks will be carried over. Wheat
has eased off during the week, largely in sympathy
with a weaker corn market, though the exports from
the United States have been very large. An improved
export demand for corn is springing up, owing to
decreasing shipments to Europe from the Argentine.
THE end of the long period of prosperity has not
yet appeared on the commercial horizon. All
business advices report the same large distribu
tion of merchandise, the same firmness in prices and
the same confidence which have prevailed with
scarcely an interruption for several years. Even the
.West and Southwest, which have been lately known
as the "drought-stricken" sections, are reporting busi
ness better and the condition of the late crops con
siderably improved. Some points report the jobbing
trade even better than a year ago. The South is re
porting business better and the cotton market firmer,
though the latter is a negative improvement, being
largely due to damage to the crop. The East re
ports the distributive trade fully up to this time in
1900. A large wheat crop in the Northwest gives
advices from that region a rosy tinge. As for the
Pacific Coast, reports from this section could hardly
TRADE STILL ROSY.
The steamer Celtic, which recently crossed the At

FOR .three years in succession Lady Constance : Mackenzie Â¦ has carried off
the Ladies' Challenge Shield of the London Bath Club, a feat which rivets
-her claim to the title of the champion swimmer among the women of Great
Britain. Her cousin. Miss Chaplin, was second in the last contest, which
took place recently In London. Lady Constance is a very fine gymnast, as
well as swimmer, and it would, according to the Tatler, "be hard to find a pret
tier sight than when, dressed in her green swimming maillot and tartan waist
ribbon, she passes along the line of swinging rings which are suspended above
the water" of the Bath Club's tanks. Lady Constance Mackenzie is a daughter
of the late Lord Cromartie.
Here's hoping that Owen McCarty was never
caught', but that he lived to be. a soldier in 1776 as a
free man. As for the Baltimore American, we can
only congratulate it on its vigorous old age, and say
with sincerity that we have been so well satisfied with
its first issue we trust the people of Maryland will
never see the last.
Altogether, the first issue of the Maryland Journal
and Baltimore Advertiser was an interesting one,
even if it did have very little in the way of live news
except the snake story and an advertisement an
nouncing: "Ten pounds rewardâ Ran away on the
6th of July last from the subscriber, an Irish servant
man named Owen McCarty,, about" 45 years old.
* * * He was a soldier in some part of America
about the time of Braddock's defeat and can give a
good description of the country."
The most interesting feature of the paper is an an
nouncement by George Washington of Mount Ver
non that he. had patented 20,000 acres of land on the
Ohio and the Great Kanawha and was prepared to
subdivide it and let it in tracts to suit tenants. Wash
ington was a good real estate boomer, for he did not
hesitate to pay for space enough to describe the lands
and say: "It is needless to premise that none can ex
cel them in luxuriance of soil or convenience of situ
ation, all of them lying upon the banks of either the
Ohio or Kanawha, and abounding with fine fish and
wild fowl of various kinds, as also in most excellent
meadows." . ,
There must have been lots of local news in and
around Baltimore in the stirring times of 1773, but
the editor did not pay much attention to it. It is
true he gave space to the item: "A few weeks ago a
large rattlesnake was killed on a gentleman's planta
tion in the neighborhood of this town, in the belly of
which was found three middle-size rabbits. The snake
had ten rattles and was supposed to be about 13 years
old." It is to be noted, however, that the incident
occurred some weeks before it was published, and be
sides it was a snake story, so it*can hardly be taken
as an evidence that the editor cared anything about
local news pr was trying to run a sensational sheet.
The rest of his paper is taken up with essays, pleasing
anecdotes, a few advertisements and a long '_ address
from the Bishop of C. to the Earl of Bellamont on
the sin of dueling.
Evidently the "entrance money" was forthcoming,,
for the race was started and the paper ha? been in it
and up with the leaders ever since.
As for the policy of the paper, it is announced: "I
shall always publish with pleasure whatever is sent
me in favour of Liberty and the Rights of Mankind,
provided the Language be decent and compatible with
good government, but I am resolved that my Paper
shall be Free and of No Party." Finally he says:
"Haying entered upon a very arduous and expensive
undertaking, I must now earnestly entreat the imme
diate assistance of every subscriber in advancing the
entrance money, agreeable to contract."
The paper at its beginning took to itself the title,
"Maryland Journal and Baltimore Advertiser." The
salutatory does not announce that the paper was
started to fill a long-felt want, but the editor did say
that he made the venture by reason .of "encourage
ment" received from "many gentlemen." He sets
forth with the emphasis of italics the difficulties that
confronted him. In the first place it was not easy to
obtain "a proper assortment of printing materials and
an adequate number of subscribers to defray the
charge of printing." In the next place it was diffi
cult to get news, for, as he said: "It is impracticable
to print such a paper as would suit this part of the
country without establishing a Rider from Baltimore
to Philadelphia to set out from the last-mentioned
pleace early on Monday morning and arrive jiere on
Tuesday evening." Not being able at the time to
provide for that expeditious news service, he started
his paper with a promise to his patrons that he would
supply them with live news ahead of the King's post
as soon as he received a support that justified the
expense.

A writer In the "Berliner Tageblatt points
out the great advantage which the Italian
navy possesses in speed, especially in the
battleships Sardegna and Margherita
class, over the majority of the ships of
foreign navies. The average speed of
Italian ships Is 20 knots, against that of
IS knots for German ships. This allows
the Italian vessels, even if inferior in
armament, to choose between fighting and
retiring. The critic praises In the highest
terms the inventive and constructive
genius of the officers of the Italian navy,
and Â¦ he also points out the weak spots,
which are, briefly, slowness in building,
want of cruising reasonably long periods
under steam and ships lying too long In
port. The necessity for practicing econ
omy is the cause for the tw/> latter draw
backs, through which officers and craw
get too little actual navigation and insuf
ficient gun practice.

An Interesting trial with liquid fuel was
made recently on board the Dutch tor
pedo-boat Ophlr with a view of testing
Holden's system of oil-burning. A trial
was first made with coal, which gave &
speed of 24'^ knots over a long course.
Then the oil burners were started In addi
tion to the coal, the consumption of which
latter remained constant, and with the
oil and coal together the speed rose to
2<% knots. The coal burned, throughout
the trial was at the rate of 2S00 pounds
per hour and the quantity of oil used was
700 pounds per hour. The Ophlr has two
boilers of equal size, and a further trial
was made at slow speed, using one boiler
with oil, when a speed of 14 knots was
attained with a consumption of- 500 pounds
of oil per hour. The liquid fuel used was
Borneo oil.
The firm of Vickers' Sons & Maxim at
Barrow-in-Furness has come to the front
as one of the most important ship yards
In the world. In 1897. when the yard
passed into the hands of the present firm,
the number of men employed was 5400;
there are now 10,500, and the weekly
wage3 amount to $82,500. The navy work
on hand comprises two battleshlps./threa
first class protected cruisers and five sub
marine boats, and several merchant
steamers are also being built. In the gun -
mounting 1 department mountings for six
battleships and twelve cruisers, fitted
with 12-inch, P.2-inch and 6-inch twin
/nounts. are being made, besides twenty
nine sets of mounts for the 9.2-inch guns
at Dover. The value of work In hand is
approximately $22,500,000.
Austria Is building three coast defense
ships of 8200 tons, one of which, the Ar
pad, is to be launched September 11 at
Trieste. They will carry batteries of
three 9.4-inch, twelve 6-lnch qulck-flrer3
and twenty-fcur smaller rapid-firing
guns. Their armor protection is of 8.6
inch Harveyized steel and a protective
deck 2% inches thick. The horsepower i3
11,900, to give a speed of 1SY 2 knots, and
the coal capacity of SCO tons is sufficient
for 3600 miles at 10 knots. The second ship
of this class and type is named the Haps
burg, and will be launched before the end
of the year, while the third, not yet
named, has just been begun.
The Montapet water-tube boiler is the
latest type of steam generators tried in
France. At a private test the rapidity
was shown by which the boiler tubes
could be removed and replaced. After a
four hours' trial the fires were drawn and
the boiler emptied, when the selected tube
was withdrawn and a new one Inserted.
The time occupied was about forty min
utes, although the practical work of re-,
placement required was less than ten
minutes. After the boiler was cold thirty
two tubes were taken out In one hour and
twenty minutes and were found straight
and in good condition.
-A submarine boat is under construction
at Cronstadt. It is said to be on the plans
of Lieutenant Kolbassieff, built under the
direction of Xaval Constructor Koutelni
koff. Great secrecy is observed and the
statements made in Russian papers con
cerning the wonderful performance antici
pated are mere guesswork, it being as
serted that the boat is to make a speed
of thirty-six to forty-five miles an hour.
The French naval budget for 1901-02 pro
vides for an increase of 367 line officers

increased from 754 to 870 and ensigns and

The Czar owes it to his fame to have at least some
sort of a case brought before the cou-t. If he cannot
bring in one from the outside he should make one
out of his own various disputes. The world wishes
the High Court to do business. There is, a desire
to see it in solemn session and in operation. If it do
not soon accomplish something to gain the respect of
mankind St. Louis may be tempted to bring it over
as an annex to her exposition and put it in the mid
way.
It is to be feared the nations are going to treat the
High Court with contempt. Up to this time it has
done nothing more important than to meet at The
Hague, organize and dine sumptuously. The dinner
was no doubt good, for The Hague chefs are reputed
to be excellent; but was the great peace tribunal
called into existence with so much ceremony by the
majestic powers of the world merely to discuss a soup
and decide upon the merits of an entree?
All these dangers have for the present passed away,
and no doubt the satisfaction of the statesmen of the
nations is great. It is to be noted, however, that in
this case there has been lost another golden oppor
tunity to give employment to the dignitaries of the
High Court of Arbitration! Why did not France,
the representative of light and civilization, instead
of threatening the Sultan with war, summon him into
court and ask for judgment against him?
Russia's keen interest in Turkey is well known. She
has regarded Constantinople as her legitimate prey
for many years past, in fact ever since the days of
Peter the Great. Of late Germany has taken a large
interest in Turkish affairs.. Her capitalists, her bank
ers and her merchants own extensive railways in Tur
key and Â¦ virtually control the trade of the country.
They have recently obtained a concession for a
railway to connect the present system in Asia Minor
with the Persian Gulf. Germany, therefore," could not
have stood aloof had there been anything like a dan
ger of a disruption of the empire of the Sultans. Aus
tria and Great Britain also have interests there, and
would of course have been ready to fight for them.
Europe is to be congratulated upon the peaceable
solution of what threatened to be a very perplexing
problem. The situation is such that a war between
France and Turkey could hardly have progressed far
without bringing on the interference of other powers,
for the war might result in the breaking up of the
Ottoman Empire in Europe, amd when that event
takes place there are several lions and some jackals
that wish to share in the spoils.
ONCE more an Ottoman war cloud, after-rap
idly forming and darkening over Europe,
threatening to involve many nations, has dis
sipated into a thin'mist and passed away.' The Sultan
has yielded to the pressure of France, has consented
that the" French- quay company may exercise its
rights under the original concession without further
opposition from the. Turkish authorities, and has,
moreover, renewed his promise to pay the French
claims. What mist could be thinner than that?

White remained in a cell in the prison
for some hours and was then bailed out

carrying of the concealed weapon and $5
for the disturbance of the peace. ; s..j

prietors agreed "to take $5 for damage to
the door and say nothing, more about tho
matter, but White refused to pay and
was taker: 1r- the City Prison.
John White, who gives his occupation
as an architect, was arrested yesterday
morning by Policemen Owens and Peters
at the Grand Hotel and booked at the
City Prison on charges of disturbing the
peace and carrying a concealed weapon.
White had been spending his vacation
in the country and returned Saturday
evening. He engaged a room at the
Grand Hotel and . started In to see the
sights. About 9 o'clock yesterday morn-
Ing he rang the bell and* the bellboy was
ordered to bring him a. Scotch "high bal.,"
The boy took the drink to White's room
and that Individual, after swallowing it,
asked the boy to bring his valise to his
bedside. White opened the valise and took
out a huge revolver, which he says he
used for shooting squirrels. He placed
three cartridges in the weapon and to the
boy's amazement fired three, shots in
quick succession through the cross panel
of the door of his room, to show the youth
his marksmanship.
General, Chaffee says he considers the
city of Manila to be perfectly orderly and
he can see no prospect of an uprising.
Commissioner Wright thinks the people
"extremely peaceable." He , Is satisfied
that, although among a certain class there
is some discontent on account of the land
tax, which is not yet understood, this
class is* not likely to foment trouble.
Many army officers say they are grati
fied at the Increase In the military^force
They think that, with the military guard
withdrawn from the prison, another up
rising there might result in the release of
about 1800 prisoners." . This possibility Â¦ is
regarded as a menace to the city by those
who take that view of the case, as they
regard the- white guard as insufficient.
Civil officials look upon this contingency
as unlikely, inasmuch' as the 600 white
police could mobilize at the prison before
any of the prisoners could escape and
become dispersed throughout the dis
affected district.
In the city of Manila there are now less
than 1000 effective soldiers and it has been
decided to Increase this number by. four
companies of Infantry. The official rea
son for the increase Is that the guard
duty Is too heavy for the present force.'
As a matter of fact, however, there Is a
feeling that, although there is no appar
ent prospect of trouble, nevertheless, in
the event of an uprising In the future,
such as is always possible among the
Malays, it would be better to have a suf
ficient body of troops available. .

Denies He Is a Beggar.
The wealthy beggar said that he lived
in the Potrero in San Francisco, where
he had a brother, and that he was nearly
SO years of age.
The police have been complained to sev
eral times of late that an extremely old
man was going about Oakland begging
from door to door, and that when he was
refused alms or whatever he asked for
he became very abusive, frightening
women and children. The police were
trying to locate the old man, and this
morning they received a telephone mes
sage from East Oakland that an old man
was going about begging and denouncing
those who refused him. The sender of
the message, A. L. Jeffries, was asked to
detain the old man until Officer Moore
and the patrol wagon could be sent over.
Policeman Moore brought the old man
back to the prison with him.
The old man was very active physically
and mentally and gave his name and age
quickly. When searched $3 25 in silver
was found in his pockets, and then the
surprises began. First a bank book on
the Columbian Banking Company was
found, showing deposits aggregating
$1150. This rather staggered the police,
for it is not customary to find beggars
with such healthy bank accounts. Then
the United States bonds began to appear.
Three bonds of the denomination of $1000
each, the market value of which is $4140
without counting the interest due, were
taken from the beggar's vest pocket. Al
together the man under arrest on a
charge of begging was found to have
more than $5000 in valuables on his per
son.

This is the extremely remarkable record
that stands on the register of the Oak
land City Prison, placed there this morn
ing by "Citizen A. L. Jeffries and Officer
Moore."
The old man went back to his cell, com
menting upon the way of doing things in
Oakland, and the police began to look for
a safe, fearing some one might rob the

them to communications from the dead,
transcribed on the great parchment
given to mortals by favoring- gods cen
turies ago.
Ross alley is thought to be the spot in
San Francisco where the souls of the
dead can most easily come and where
the evil spirits are forbidden to exercise
their powers artl there the Chinese
made their most gorgeous display. The
narrow little street was roofed over with
white canvas, from which depended hun
dreds of gigantic bouquets. Open cabi
nets filled with images of former Chi
nese Emperors and other illustrious dead
occupied y every available inch of wall
space, the whole being illuminated with
thousands upon thousands of red wax
candles, whicn were constantly being re
placed as thev were consumed. 'Within
all the clubhouses which line the alley
were bands of musicians who played
tunes of which visiting spirits are sup
posed to be fond. Little tables loaded
with Chinese delicacies were placed .all
along the sidewalks where the invisible
loved ones might enjoy the repasts.
The feast will continue with lessened
enthusiasm for the next two days. It
is celebrated thrice annually, in March,
at the present time and again in Kovem
ber. Every feature of the observance is
dictated by a revelation from the divini
ties, given ages ago, far back beyond the
wavering line where history and mythol
ogy meet. It is celebrated among the
Chinese everywhere, whether it be in tne
crowded cities of the Celestial empire or
in some secluded spot in a far distant
corner of the world where a single
Chinaman dwells alone.
The great feast of the Chinese held
three times yearly to propitiate the
deities in behalf of the souls of dead
relatives was celebrated with many of
ferings and the burning of many candles
in Chinatown last night.
The Central this week offers a spectacu
lar revival of "The Two Orphans,"; the
ever popular old melodrama. The new
leading lady. Miss Annette Marshall, is
cast as Henrietta; and will be supported
by the best talent the house affords. The
big .scriptural play, Edward Eisner's "A
Voice From the Wilderness," is now in ac
tive preparation and will be produced
Tuesday evening, September 3. This is the
most important production that the Cen
tral management has ever been engaged
In, and promises to be the most success
ful.
\ Â¦ .. . . â¢ ;â¢/.*Â¦. , > .. Â¦ Â¦_
The new bill which' opens at the Chutes
to-day Includes the Esmonds, refined tnus
lcal artists; Ina Allen, soprano; Ameta,
the European spectacular dancer; Robert
A. Nome, musical comedian; Hayes
brothers, Australian singing and dancing
comedy duo, and Ed F. Reynard, the
ventriloquist. New moving pictures will
also be shown. .
"Romeo and Juliet" will be the Alca
zar programme this week, with Miss
Florence Roberts and White Whittlesey in
the name parts.* Juliet was one of Miss
Roberts' most admired roles during her
season of two years ago, and with a good
cast the play should prove a popular bill.
Mr. Frawley's bill at the Grand Opera
House this week Is R. C. Carton's comedy,
"Lord and Lady Algy," first seen here un
der the auspices of Henry Miller's com
pany two years ago. It is a very amus
ing play, based upon the racing misfor
tunes of Lord Algy, and the sporting
wisdom of his spouse, who is said .to be
drawn from a prominent member of the
British aristocracy. Mr. Frawley will
play the part of Lord Algy, and Miss Van
Buren Lady Algy.
The Tivoli will give a repeat bill this
week, "II Trovatore," with the same cast
as before, and "Meflstofele," that has
been so successful this last week. "II
Trovatore" will have Salassa as the
Count di Luna, Barbareshi appears as
Leonera, Collamarlni sings Azucena and
Russo Manrico. The "Meflstofele" cast
Includes "Dado in the name part, Agos
tinl as Faust, Montanari as Marguerite
and Polltlni as Martha.
The Madison Square Theater success,
"Wheels Within Wheels," will be present
ed by Daniel Frohman's company at tho
Columbia Theater for one .week commenc
ing with this evening. Hilda Sprong will
appear in the leading role, which she
created when the Carton comedy was first
produced in this country. The role is es
pecially well fitted to her best style of
stage work. All the clever people of the
company will be advantageously cast.
Next. Monday evening theater-goers will
be offered no less important an attrac
tion than Annie Russell in her magnifi
cent' success, "A Royal Family." She
will be supported by all the original New
York cast. Â¦ .
â¢ â¢ â¢ Â¦ . . â¢
Some of the newi people at the Olympia
this week are / the great European
jugglers, the Gagnoux; Iza Miller, comedi
enne; Memphis Kennedy,- musical com
edian, and Annie Morris, J coon shouter. Â¦Â¦-'
Among the entertainers' at Fischer's
Concert House this week are Marietta
Worth and company in the original
musical .farce, "Wanda's Aspirations;"
Camelia and Amelita, Spanish dancers;
Joe Edmunds, Irish comedian; Fannie
Raymond, balladist; Joseph Berges,
aerialist; P. A. Dunsworth, tenor; Cole
man and Mexis, the great* sharpshooters,
and the Paloma Quartette, composed of
Lily Laws, Ethel Carrol, Millie Murray
and Eugenia Breitengross.
â¢ The production of "Rosemary" by
James Neill and his clever company at
the California last night was a very
pleasing performance. Barring the long
waits between the acts, the rendition of
the pretty little play, satisfied tne audi
ence and gave the performers a firmer
hold on the affections of San Francisco
theater-goers. Neill's Sir Jasper Thorn
dyke was a decidedly clever piece of
work, and the Captain Cfuikshank of
John W. Burton was an exceptional dis
play of talent. Julia Dean as Dorothy
won -the favor of. the audience as soon as
she ape&red. Her farewell to Sir Jasper
at the end of the third act brought forth
round after round of hearty applause
from the house, as did also the acting of
Neill in the scene where he declares his
love for Dorothy.
Powell, the magician, with a good com
pany, is among the new headliners. He is
a deft and picturesque wizard and has a
new trunk trick that is a very mystifying
affair. Louise Thorndyke Boucicault and
Herbert H. Pattee are seen in their last
week's sketch, "A Proper- Impropriety,"
and â¢ "The Four Otts" also : repeat their
hilarious absurdity, "The Smart Set,"
Mat Ott's sketch, by the way, and a
rattling good -one. Last in the bill, but
most, come the Cragg crowd of acrobats,
programmed as six, with eight In the turn,
and as many more of the same kind in
the wings, according to report. This is
their second week, but their brilliant and
original tumbling, much the best of its
kind ever seen here, would keep the
Craggs among the first favorites for many
weeks to come. Remarc and Riley are
other good holdovers, and the biograph is
wcrth waiting for.
Professor Rosner played the accompani
ment for Jose. His wÂ° r k proved a great
treat to the audience and a splendid help
to the singer.
Lucille Saunders, Dick Jose and Le
febre'8 saxophone quartet take excellent
care of the musical part of the Orpheum's
gcod programme this week. Miss Saunders
laarte her first Western appearance yes
terday afternoon, and was . heartily
greeted by the large house. She has a
sweet; sympathetic tontralto voice, with
some luscious low notes, and sings with
grace and ease. Among her numbers are
"If You Were Only Mine," from "The
Singing Girl," in which the clever song
stress apDeared In the East with Alice
Nielsen, and* "Don't You Cry," a little
lullaby song very sweetly rendered. Dick
Jose is as popular as ever, if not more so,
in his selections of the week, and the
Lefebre quartet of saxophone players re
peated their success of last week in new
numbers It is both a clever and highly
pleasing performance.

NEW YORK, Aug. 25.â At Vailsburg,
N. J., to-day W. S.*Fenn of . Waterbury
adcWl fresh laurels to his list. After a
hard struggle in the half-mile open for
professionals he started, out with sixty
three other, riders in the five-mile, handi
cap for professionals. He started off at. a
clipping pace and mowed -down his /rivals
one ai a time. McFarland had KKhyards
on thV youngster, but this did not bother
Fenn. Entering the home stretch Fenn
had the speed and fairly ran away from
the others, winning by about five. lengths.
His time was 10:15. The other worlds
record for the distance was 10:33 2 T 5.
There was a wrangle in the two-mile
handicap, where another world's record
was broken', but it may not be, allowed.
Lake and McConnell j came down the
stretch close together, but. to the major
ity of the spectators it looked as if Mc-
Connell, the scratch man, had won by a
few inches. Referee Moher gave the race
to Lake' and the onlookers ,, fairly
Bcreamed their displeasure. The, time was
4:00 flat, which beats the old world's rec
ord bv 12 4-5 seconds. â¢
The half-mile open was run with many
heats, not unlike the circuit champ'on
ship. The final was. between La wson and
Kramer, and Lawson won by about- a
length., Kramer's - friends immediately
challenged Lawson for a match against
Kramer and' offered odds, of $500 on Kra
mer to $450 on Lawson. Lawson accepted
the challenge.- ..T .<Â¦'; . ;

Stanford Parlor No. 76, Native Sons of
the Golden West, will celebrate Admis
sion Day this year by a Saturday to
Tuesday outing at Mark West. Springs,
Sonoma County. The reason why Stan
ford Parlor is holding an independent
celebration is because at the last Grand
Parlor in Santa Barbara it was decided
not to hold a general celebration of Ad
mission Â«Day this year. Since then the
San Jose parlors arranged for a celebra
tion In that city, but Stanford Parlor had
already perfected its own arrangements.
The "Good of the Order" committee, of
which John J. Van Nostrand is. chairman
and Fred H. Jung secretary, has arranged
a pleasing programme for Stanford's cele
bration, which will be attended by parlor
members and their relatives and friends.
The programme includes the departure
from the city of the party on the after
noon of September 7. Upon arrival at the
BT.rlnca in the evening there vill be a
supper followed by illumination and an
informal dance. On â¢ September 8 there
will be a bullshead breakfast in the
morning and a sacred concert in the
afternoon. In the evening there. will be
an illumination and alfresco entertain
ment at which time the phantom operet
ta "The Spectre Knight." including a
ghostly ballet, will be produced. , *.

being the sloop Amigo. in which Commo
dore H. D. Hawks carried his flag, Vlc8
Commodore E. F. Sagar's sloop. Edjia. thÂ«
sloops Freda, Queen and the yawl Arc

Tuesday, after sailing through the Mon
tezuma slough, where the yawl Arcturus
tore her mainsail and broke hAT gaff. On
the homeward journey the fleet sailed
through the Georgiana slough Into the
San Joaquin River, thence to Antloch and
Martinez.
On Saturday night nearly all the fleet,
both the yachts which had been up the
Sacramento a^d those which left Tiburon
on Saturday afternoon* met at Vallejo,
sailing down yesterday on the ebb tide.
In the upper bay there was almost a flat
calm in the afternoon, and several of tha
yachts were towed by launches or Jay
hawked into Tiburon cove. Frank Bart
lett's yawl Spray will remain up the river
for another week. Throughout the cruise
the yachtsmen enjoyed good breezes and
beautiful weather. The sloop Ariel started
somewhat later than the others, but
joined them at Courtland.
The San Francisco Yacht Club had no
scheduled event yesterday, but most of
the fleet was under sail, the sloops Thetis,
Cygnus, Surprise and Anita cruising up
to Paradise cove, and the schooner Lur
line and sloops Mischief and Dewey tak
ing a channel sail. The schooner Waye
and the catboat Dulce cruised to Paradise
cove. On the return trip the wind was
very light, and It was necessary to tow
out from Paradise . cove Into Raccoon
Straits, where a fair breeze picked them
up and carried them to Sausalito. In tho
channel the breeze was 'strong and steady
and a fine sail was enjoyed.

the surf. No accidents or incidents worthy
of mention were reported to the police.

MORNING GAME.
Fresh from defeat. Manager Morley of
Ix>s Angeles took his seat in the box bacn
of the press stand at Recreation grounds
yesterday. ' Ho bore the burden of three
beatingrs out of four diamond competi
tions with the Dudes. When he left the
grounds he carried an extra package of
defeat. Morley's entrance into the city
of sunshine and oil pumps will not be full
of trailing glory. . -
The game was close, 3-2, and the ninth
inning was necessary to put the Quietus
upon it. Here is whree the excitement
v.as unbottled. With the score against
them the Angels came to the stick, hop
ing like professional hopers. Through the
courtesy of tagau and Arrellanes, who
made a couple of errors, and by the time
two deaths were reported Rcitz. Hutchin
son and Atherton found themselves on
tbe bags. Then came the chance for C
Reilly to play several kinds of Casey.
Keiily was only half a Casey, for he did
not strike out. Instead of this he slapped
the t>all toward Francks. who cut off
Atherton tearing down the path toward
second and tne game was over. Unhappy
Angels, unhappy Alorley! Even with
Householder and Reitz back in the game
victory held aloof like an insulted dam
sel.
The second round was the starting point
for the run-getting on both sides. For
Oakland Arrellanes secured a pass, and
with Moskiman was safe on Reitz's er
ror. At this juncture Drennan hit a safe
cne, bringing- Arrellanes In, but the doc
tor was caught at the plate.
Captain Keilly led on! with a two-bag
ger for his team, went to third on bow
mans sacrilice and scored on the throw-
In or" a long fly by Kelly to the center
garden. In the next inning the Looloos
made their second and last tally. Reltz,
Hutchinson and Householder each
straightened out one of the doctor's best,
and it began to look bad for the men from
across the pond. A little sharp fieldinc.
however, had its effect, and the red legs
were forced to be content with bringing
Heitz home on Atherton's out to Babbitt.
The lJudes sent two more over the route
in the fourth and fifth. Babbitt got four
bad ones, went to secondÂ»on Uoskiman's
hit, and by a great maneuver on the part
of Pete Lohman between the first and
second stations was enabled to cross the
rubber.
OAKLAND.
Ine fifth bore more fruit for the tail
enuers. Francks began by hammering out
a three-station swipe to right and cam*
one further on Reitz's error of Eagan's
drive. Score:

The . two coursing events which were
offered as the attraction at Union Park
yesterday resulted in an unusually good
day's sport. In both stakes the trials were
of "the even sort and in many of the goes
the decision was in doubt until the flag
was waved.
In the Reserve stake. Black Flush won
first honors, beating Liberator in a good
final.
The victory marks the first for the get
of Royal Flush, and in geting into the
final Liberator also established a record
for himself.
Black Flush in going through the stake
upset all figuring and scored three win
nings on the short end. He beat Fonte
noy at 5 to 3 in the second. Faraway at 2
10 1 in the fourth artd Real Article at 5. to
3 In the semi-final.
The second round proved a bad one for
the scientific bettor, nine of the twenty
decisions going against' the favorites. Real
Aristocrat caused the heaviest shock to
the. wise ones by beating Lear. King, a 5
to 1 choice. . Santonin, a .7 to 2 favorite,
failed to score against Ripple, his work
of the previous day showing plainly
against him. . Â¦â¢ Â¦
jtocker^ ran well and at one time was a
factor in the stake. In the fourth. he beat
Kirst Foot, a u to 2 favorite, in^ a long
course and had to be withdrawn. Johnnie
K. and Kegina 1-t., as oye dogs, beat re
sceptively Heal Article at 3 to l and Liber
ator at 2 to 1. . â¢Â¦Â¦..â¢ "
Albert Curtis finished one, two, three
in the Class stake. Flying- Fox beat
Luxor in tne final in a close course and
sector reacnea tne semi-nnal. Â¦
Rector met Palo Alto in tne first round
and won a great go. Geary's dog was a 2
to 1 favorite and showed a bit the better
dog. A hard fall lost him his chance, and
Hector getting the kill won by that mar
gin. The woik of these dogs caused con
siderable enthusiasm.
Hector next beat Ireland, then Dew
drop, and in the seml-linal went out to
his kennel. mate Luxor. . , Â¦
Flying Fox s great stamina pulled him
througn. v Little Sister was his first oppo
nent and he beat her 3-3. He beat Game

The Dudes rubbed it into the Angels at
Oakland yesterday morning, although at
the outset of the game it looked as if
the reverse would happen. Moskiman
was hit hard in the first inning and soon
after was supplanted by Hodson. In the
second inning the Dudes sailed right into
Jones and on three hits and errors scored
four runs. They had another good inning
in the rixth, when three tallies were
scored.
Dr. Moskiman was presented with a
handsome gold watch, a testimonial from
his many appreciative friends. Score:

Frank Anderson was for years a well
known commercial. traveler who regularly
visited Galena, Kans. He was passionate
ly fond of honey and the proprietor of the
Galena Hotel, at which he always stopped
always had some on hand for him. On
one trip Anderson took his wife along,
and as he approached Galena he men
tioned to her that he was getting to a
place where he could have honey. When
the pair were s'tting at the supper table
that night no honey appeared and An
derson said sharply to the head waiter:
"Where is my honey?"
The waiter smiled and said: "You
mean the little black-eyed one? Oh,
she don't work here now?" â¢
And Anderson never did get It fixed up
satisfactorily with hi3 wife.â Kansas City

Not th* Honey He Wanted.
Simultaneously with the announcement
that nine new battleships would be ready
for service in the British navy comes the
report from Corsica that the French sub
marine boat Gustave 'Zede has succeeded
perfectly In attaching a torpedo to the
bottom of a French battleship without be
ing detected. "The bigger the British
navy the more food for our submarine
devil-fish" cry the French editors, exult
antly. Possibly. If ' the submarine ' boat
ls a practical success a really trustworthy
engine of naval warfare, all nations will
soon have numbers of them and the coast
and harbor defenses will have acquired a
powerful advantage. More than this, all
maritime powers will' find themselves un
der heavier bonds than ever to kÂ»ep the
peace, when their costly navies can be
blown to atoms by an unseen foe.âBuf

"Well," said his mother, "I hope you
were a good boy and remembered what
I told you?"
"Yes, mother, but they were awfully
rude to me." .
"Why, what did they do?"
"They brought me truffle three times."
"Very rude, indeed, darling, and of
course you said, 'No, thank you?' "
"I said 'No, thank you,' twice, but I
didn't know what to say next time."
The small boy went to the party, and
in due course returned, somewhat sub
dued in manner.
"And if they bring.it to me again?"
"You must still say, 'No, thank you.*
But they won't do that; it would bÂ«
rude."
A little boy was going: to a party, and
his mother impressed upon him that h*
was on no account to touch truffleâ that
dyspeptic delight of youth.
"But, mother," objected the small boy,
"if they bring me some?"
"You must say. 'No. thank you.* "

September 1. -
Mrs. Colwell and her friends thanked
Mr. Mott for his act of heroism and the
spectators. of it applauded him.
Spectators of the runaway Â¦ hurried to
the assistance of Its victims. They found
Mrs. Colwell in a dead faint in the bottom
of the surrey, her friend hysterical and
the young girl suffering from a hemorr
hage, the result of fright. Restoratives
were applied and the unfortunates soon
recovered.
The attention of Mr. Mott was called to
the runaway by two ladles whom he was
driving in a surrey on Clement avenue.
He drew to one side at a point near Chest
nut street to avoid a collision and alighted,
having resolved upon an attempt to stop
the runaway. Running swiftly alongside
the horse as he dashed past Mr. Mott
grabbed the broken rein with one hand
and the shaft with the other and pulled
backward with all his might. In this way
the struggle was kept up for two blocks
before the animal was finally brought to
a standstill near the corner of Union
street.
One of the ladies In the carrlace was
Mrs. Frank Colwell of Mosa avenue. Oak
land. She was taking a friend and her
young daughter for a drive through Ala
meda in her surrey. As they pas?ed Oak
street, going west on Clement avenue,
they were almost run Into by a careless
automobilist. The steam from the ma
chine frightened the horse so that he
broke one of the reins with which Mrs.
Colwell was trying to manage him. He
then started on a wild run down the ave
nue, narrowly missing at least two ve
hicles on the way, while the occupants of
the surrey screamed at the top of their
voices.
ALAMEDA. Aug. 23.â Robert Mott.
president of the Alameda Land Company,
turned hero this afternoon and saved two
ladies and a chilfl from serious injury and
possible death in a runaway accident. As
the horse, in Its wild career, flew by him
he jumped for its head and held on until
It came to a stop, risking his own life and
limbs in the brave act.

Captain Forsyth, who will be retl'M
September 25, under. the forty years' serv
ice act, has been associated with Admirals
Schley and Sampson at different timÂ«H
during his long life in the navy. When
he left Key West, he took command of
the battleship Indiana. Later he was
chief of staff to Admiral Watson in
charge of the Asiatic squadron, and' for
the past several months has been 'second
in command at. the Mare Island Navy
Yard. Captain Forsyth left to-night for
St. Louis, where he will spend a few days
before proceeding to Philadelphia.
"The fact that a junior man was placed
in command. above his seniors is respous
ible for the whole business," continued
Captain Forsyth. "Sampson was a cap
tain, and the seventeenth ranking officer
ot the navy; No one ever thought of him
as the successor. of Admiral Sicard, and I
don't believe he ever thought of it him
self. But he was familiar to the peoplo
of Washington, and they decided to place
him in command. Of course, the officers
who outranked him did not like it. It is
not to be expected that they would. But
Washington said Sampson, and that set
tled the matter. Schley was among r'rjj
Officers- outranking Sampson, and as he
was thrown directly under the junior
command, he naturally felt the promotion
more than any of the others.
"The battle of Santiago was one of the
most brilliant in history. Regardless -
who was responsible for the plans, or wli?
was directly responsible for such effect' .-e
execution, them was clory enoueh Â¦>!â¢
both Sampson and Schley. The preÂ«"ft4t
controversy only serves to dim the bril
liancy of the victory, and it is to be
greatly deplored. That any one should
question the bravery of either of the men
is particularly unfortunate and, I believe
wholly unjustified." '
"While we have been instructed by th^
Navy Department not to discuss the mÂ«jr
its of the case every one knows that th<;
navy looks upon the controversy as an
unfortunate affair. We believe there was
plenty of glory for all concerned.

OMAHA. Neb., Aug. 25.â Pursued by a
howling mob of 200 Pawnee Bill showmen,
who were hurling all kinds of threads at
him, Harley Cave, a young High School
athlete, shot and instantly killed Joe
Sullivan, a candy butcher with the show,
and one of the gang, at Correctionvllle,
Iowa, at an early hour this morning. The
trouble began at the depot as the show
people were getting ready to leave after
the evening performance.
One of the toughs of the town insisted,
on talking to some women of the show
and a gang of the roustabouts surround
ed him. Cave had a revolver and in the
mixup which followed the mob took after
him, mistaking him for the offender. They
chased him to the city hotel. wherÂ« he
held them at bay for a time, warning
them he would shoot any one who at
tacked him. Sullivan made a dash and
Cave kept his word. After the shooting
the mob was wild, and threatened to hang
and shoot Cave. When they found they
were unable to get him. he having es
caped Into art upstairs room, they threat
ened to burn the house and started to de
molish it. Major Lilly, "Pawnee Bill,"
helped quiet the crowd, and with the town
officers assisted Cave to escape. When
the mob found he had gone it was fur
ious. Cave came to Sioux City and sur
rendered to Sheriff Jackson. The citizens
of Correctionville hold Cave blameless,
saying, he acted in self denfense. The
show went on to Missouri Valley.

I believe that the system which divides men
Into two great classes â one the tool owners,
who do no work except supervision, and the
other the tool workers, who own no share of
the tools they useâ the one class the payers,
the other the receix-ers oT wagesâ cannot and
ought not to endure. The sooner we emerge
from It into a condition in which by their
thrift, their Industry, their intelligence an-I
their temperance tool workers can become
sharers in the ownership of the tools and the
control of the industry the better for both
capital end labor, which will then be united
in the bonds of a common interest and own
ership, and strikes and lockouts will become
impossible.
Workingmen, I have been frank with you,
but I do not come to you with the miserable
cant of telling you to be content with the lot
wherein it has pleased God to call you. De
mand your rights, not as mercy, but as justice.
But conduct your campaign by peaceable
means. The ballot is in your hands. Why re
sort to violence when you have the ballot?
I knew a case wl;ere a man put nearly al!
his fortune into a tSCO.000 contract. The mÂ»n
who worked upon the job signed a contract for
three years, setting their own rate of wages.
They broke the contract right In. the middle In
a sympathetic strike at the order of a walking
delegate, and tfce man lost net only the con
tract but nearly as much more by the for
feiture of his bonds and was ruined, and with
no redress. That looks to me like tyranny.
Eut there is a worse tyranny and "more" dan
gerous one than that, and that is the growing
tyranny of aggregations of capital, that are
the chief menaces of society to-day, and un-
Ijfs tneee combinations are checked by the
Etrcnr arm of the law the time is coming and
Is near when there will be a collision between
the corporations and the trusts and the people
beside which the present widespread strike will
bs as a firing- of a single picket before the bat
tle of Gettysburg.
And frankly I am compelled to say that
labor unions are sometimes tyrannical, 'if you
were a manufacturer you could not put your
own son to learn a trade in your tun shop or
factory if there were already there the number
of apprentices the labor unions allow. Do you
k:.civ the rules of the labor unions are such
that n-ne-tenths cf our young men cannot learn
a trade? .->.
iÂ«Â£? . , re ., 8 Â£Â° < ' ue!tl0 3 a^ut the right of
h^ i t0 strike ' but l thlnk that in most cases
there Is a grave question about its expediency.
wni Â«i.H a ".K the , i dvanta se *n '"very strike and
will until the labor unions can, by education
?Â£t,i mor r *} w sua l !on - secure an absolute mo
nopoly of labor by getting practically all work-
Irginen to join them. Â¦
While capital has expanded on the one side,
the wants and intelligence of labor have ex
panded on the other. The Tvorklngman lives in
a larger world to-day than he ever did before.
He feels that his brain and brawn have helped
to build this larger world and he wants a larger
thare of it. He sees capital living in the man
elon but owning the cottageâ for not one labor
ing man In fifty owns the cottage he lives in.
Now. I am not so presumptuous* as to think
that 1 can give an offhand solution of the
present situation. It Is too complicated. If it
were a question of wages or hours it would be
simple, but I understand It is not a question
of either. The workingmen say it is a ques
tion of the right of workingmen to organize.
Two of the labor leaders of San Francisco have
recently said the present lockout, as they call
it. is a part of the conspiracy of the Employ
ers Association to crush out the labor unions,
it that be true the employers are clearly In the
wrong, for labor has at least as good a right
to combine to form a labor trustâ a labor mo
nopolyâas has capital to form any other kind
of trust or monopoly. If it were not for the
labor unions labor would be In no better posi
tion than it was fifty years ago or than It is
in Europe to-day.

As a result ef new Industrial situations we
find capital combining in great corporations
and trusts on the one hand and labor organiz
ing In seif-defense on the otherâ the one striv
ing to get a monopoly of labor, the other to
get a monopoly of the instruments of produc
tion and the means of subsistence, and they
are arrayed, in two great armies and engaged
in a battle to the death.
I have been asked to circulate a petition for
the repeal of our Chineee exclusion law. I
think the present law faulty, but am not in
favor of breaking down the barriers to either
Asiatic or European immigration. We will
have to reckon with China soon enough with
out inviting her horde* to our shores.
Discussing the labor problem. Dr. Dille
said:
The Rev. E. R. Dille, pastor of the
First Methodist Church, took a stand to
night against any effort to repeal the Chi
nese exclusion act. During the course of
a. sermon on industrial conditions as one
of the "signs of the times," the clergyman
said:

Ftudent who wished to take the examination

Blake was present when the affidavits
were read and was asked as to their
truth.- He submitted a denial in which he
taid that the misunderstanding had arisen
through his efforts to collect fees in ar
tear. When questioned later, however,
he rather spoiled this explanation by ad
mitting that none of the students whose
written statements he had just listened to
Â¦were or had been in arrears.
His explanation follows:
It ha* been reported Â»n various ways, for the
xnoFt part rumors and hearsay remark*, that
Influence can be obtained by myself with the
Ftate Board of Dental Examiners. The fact
thÂ«t many of the students were in arrpars with
their fees for tuition and intended taking the
ttate board examinations. It was deemed ad
visable to collect balances due, and In trying
to do so led to the misunderstanding: that un
less the collepe claims were paid that influence
would be used against the candidates.
In our past experience students Jn arrears on
passing the State board and obtaining- a license
to practice abruptly terminated relations with
the college.
The Board of Dental Examiners well knows
:hat no lit* of recommendations for or against
the recent candidates was handed to them and
that the proposition of trying to obtain Influ
ence has been as unfair and unjust to the gen
tlemen constituting the board as to myself, and
I wish to deny most emphatically the state
ments bo made. A. E. BLAKE
Ae the institution with which Blake is
connected is not in any way within the
jurisdiction of the board, the examiners
were not able to take any action, and
under the circumstances did not think it
necessary to put on record any opinion of
The three independent statements, all sub
stantially affirming the same thing, or of
Blake's denial of the truth of any of
them.
Statement of Examiners.
The State Board of Dental Examiners
met Saturday evening in the office of Dr.
G. S. S. Blackman, 6 Eddy street, for the
purpose of considering the charges made
by students of the dental department of
the College of Medicine and Surgery, M !
Geary street, against Alfred E. Blake,
dean of the Institution.
The students. "in July last, reported to
the State Beard that Blake had given
them to understand that unless they paid i
their fees for the full three years tuition
at the College of Medicine and Surgery
their taking the State examination would
be of little avail, but. on the other hand. '
if they could show Secretary Baekman of
the State Board a receipts in full for thÂ«
three years, he. Blake, would give them
a recommendation to the State Board
which would insure them diplomas.
Affidavits to this effect were read at
- iast night's meeting. W. B. Smith. Ferdi
nand Fisher and L. M. Lain, students at
Blake's institution, all declared in their
affidavits that Blake had made them such
a proposition. He had promised them
to return the money in the event of tfceir
failure to secure diplomas. Two of the
students wanted written agreements to
this effect. One was told he would have
to take Blake's word and the other waÂ«
asked whether he thought Blake had been
born yesterday. It was Smith who first
brought the matter to the attention of
the board.
The students' statements were obtained
L<y a committee appointed by the board to
investigate and the committee's report
was a virtual confirmation of the state of
affairs Student Smith had complained
about.

circus is in town and the small
II boy knows it. He knows it be
ll cause he was there at the entry,

with eyes and ears all wide
open to take .in the. ante-circus
sights and sounds. He crawled under
canvas and he. climbed over fences. He
wandered within dangerous reach of the
tiger's unmanicured claws and in some
Instances almost got mixed with the ele

When the Rlngling Dros.' circus strikes
a town there is something doing. From
a dusty, barren waste the grounds at Six
teenth and Folsom streets were yester
day transformed into a thickly populated
town full of business, flapping canvas,
wild animals, and, to the small boy,"glori
ous prospects of the "real thing" in the
entertainment line. Â¦
The small boy was not the only Interest
ed spectator of the whirl of preparations
for the glory to come. His sister was a
close second In enthusiastic curiosity,
and father, mother and other "grown .
ups,"- even including grandfather, were
there and just as much interested as any
of the little folks. .. .
The giraffe, which Prcmotor of Publicity
Brady loves to talk about because it costs
so much and lives on a diet specially im-'

the preparations. The little brown bears

The schooner G. W. Watson narrowly,
escaped going ashore on the South Beach
yesterday. She was beating out -when the
wind fell light and she began to drift in
shore. When off the south beach, -the
anchor" was let go and held. : Luckily the
tug Sea Queen came along a few minutes
later, and taking hold towed, the Watson
to sea.. The vessel was never in .any dan
ger,, but to the crowd on the heach and
Cliff House it looked as if she were going
ashore. r-i't . Â¦ -

When twenty miles northwest of Trinidad
she broke her shaft and ever since has
been at the mercy of the wind and waves.
The first "mate, carpenter and two sailors
managed to reach Trinidad in a boat and
the news of the disaster was telegraphed
here. A boat was sent out " Saturday
evening and the chances are the derelict
willbe picked up to-day. The Empire was
well found and there is no chance of an
accident unless. . the vessel should drift
ashore. â¢ . . Â¦

Third Vice President Kendrlck, Captain A. F.
Payson and Assistant Traffic Manager Bissel
of the Santa Fe are -examining the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers in the company's boat
Ocean Wave with a. view to get some idea of
the business handled at river landings. If it
is large enough to warrant the outlay the Santa
Fe people may put on small steamers next year
in competition with the Southern Pacific boats.
The Southern Pacific has had boats on the Sac
ramento River for years, and the business Is
understood to be profitable. The Santa Fe has
good river - stations at Stockton, Antioch and
Point Richmond. .
More river boats are to be built and
competition will be 'the order of the day

season. The Commercial News published

A few weeks ago the insurance, com
panies were willing to pay 90 per cent on
the County of Haddington, 20 per cent on
the Hydra, 12 per cent on the !Roanokt\
30 per cent on the Empire, 15 per cent on
the Renfleld, 10 per cent on the Santa
Ana, 25 per cent on the Calluna and 23
per cent on the Prince Arthur. .
Since then the Empire' has arrived at
the islands, the Roanoke has been spoken,
the Renfleld has .arrived at. Valparaiso
and the Santa Ana has been withdrawn
from the list. This leaves the County cf
Haddington, the Calluna and the Prince
Arthur among the overdues listed in thi3
market. The Haddington is making a
very long run and the probable loss of
the Manchester has something to do. with
the 90 per cent now being offered.
The County of Haddington is a sister
ship to the County of Inverness, now in
this port. The latter vessel arrived here
from Plsagua in ballast on the 10th inst.
and is under charter to load wheat for
Europe. The County of Haddington, after
discharging her cargo in the Orient, was
alsa to have come here to load wheat for
Europe. â¢ . >Â¦
ITis rarely or never that; a vessel
â¢ bound from the Atlantic Coast to the
Orient is. lost. Once in a while on
oil laden craft is. burned at sea, but
the incidents are so few and far be
tween that they are lost sight of in tha
number of oil carriers burned in port. A3
a general rule all vessels bound from New
York, for the Orient make a long passage
owing to contrary winds. In spite of this
Â¦well known fact,, however, the under
writers are afraid of this class of. vessels
and" any craft that goes beyond 150 day 3
is sure ..to appear among the "overdues."
