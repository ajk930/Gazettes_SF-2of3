Special Dispatch to The Call.
Colombian Legation. The Minister has
not -believed -that there was at any time
danger of serious trouble on the isthmus.
He has been more apprehensive ' about
conditions in the interior of Colombia and
on the Venezuelan frontier.
Mall advices which Silva received to-day
Indicate that the Government Is making
rapid headway against the insurgents
throughout "Colombia, and that there are
prospect* that order will be completely
restored In the near future. Notwithstand
ing the fact that such favorable reports
are being received there will be no change
In the orders of the Iowa, .which Is, now
coaling at Acapulco on her way to Pana
ma. It is believed that the presence of an
adequate American naval force on both
eides of the Isthmus, will have a salutary
effect, and Inasmuch as European powers
have hurried warships to the isthmus, it
Is believed to be wise to let the Iowa con
tinue on bv wav to Panama.
Headway Against Insurgents.
This dispatch confirms the information
received to-day by Minister Silva of the
Investigation of the conditions along the
line of the railway. On his return to Colon
to-day he sent this dispatch to the Nary
Department:
"I have visited Panama and Colon. The
most authoratlve results of the Investiga
tion give me the following Information:
There Is no appearance of an organized
Insurgent force In the vicinity of the rail
way. Free and uninterrupted transit ob
tains with every prospect of continuance.
The rumor Is unfounded that United
States property Is in need of assistance.
AH is quiet here and more reassuring
than when we started."
Commander Earg-ent, on his arrival -at
Colon, Â¦went ashore and traveled by rail
way across the isthmus to Panama and
back to Colon eo as to make a personal
revolutionary party, said to-day that. the

and came down Magdalena River In a

TUCSON," Ariz^"AuB.;304-There is an

Indian Reservation. One of -the ' Alexan

the Apaches have for the past three
weeks been' Â¦ holding a', dance and .the
chiefs are unable to stop it. The Indiana
are becoming crazed ,f rom drinking, too
much tisguiri, a very strong, intoxicating
liquor made by them." The prottacted de
bauchery has alarmed settlers in the val
ley because of threats made by the In
dians. . The military post at. San Carlos
was abandoned a year ago, and now the
agency is garrisoned by but six troopers
from Fort Grant, who are commanded by
a- sergeant. ' These , men '.belong- to the
Fourteenth Cavalry, which was recently
recruited, and the recrufts are mostly
"tenderfeet" who are 1 not .: familiar with
Indian warfare. However, Captain Over
ton and many trained soldiers are at Fort
Grant, and they will respond at once
if any trouble occurs, and, with four
troops ' which now ' comprise - the ' forces
at-Grant, the Indians can be kept'; from
harming the settlers. â¢ ,\ . .
. The Apaches are in bad humor, and
since the chiefs have been unable to put a
stop-.to; the, long dance;' the " settlers be
lieve they have lost control of them and
their counsels will, have little â¢ influence in
case the, young bucks go on the warpath.

, SAN -JOSE, Augr 30.â A freak lambkin
with a double body, one head and no less
than four pairs of legs,. six of which are
well .. developed;, attached to the two
trunks, -was recently born near. this city.

"Haub : is ' employed at - the â¢ slaughter
house of ' Carey ; Bros.; ; near . this city,
"where^the freak of nature was born. 'He
took the lamb home/with ' him and fed it
by- hand. . With . Its numerous- legs and
two bodies it was very awkward and un
able to help . itself. The lamb was' re
markably large, more than. fifteen inches
in. height. .It grew, at an astonishing rate
and .was. healthy and lively for more than
a week. Then, the animal sickened and
died, probably on account of its compli
cated digestive apparatus. The forequar
ters of the lamb appear, to be of -normal
size, although as the ribs are reached the
body develops into unusual dimensions
The freak part of the animal is confined
to the rear half. The bodies, which are
separate, are joined just forward of the
rear rib, and each body Is mounted upon
a pair of healthy looking, -lanky legs,
such -'as -the ordinary lamb possesses.
-The most extraordinary feature of this
remarkable animal; Is the" fourth pair of
legs, which are joined to the back of the
animal at the point where the bodies are
separated and extend backward in a per
fectly horizontal position. They appear
almost as a continuation of the back
bone, and are of the size and general ap
pearance of a pair of front legs.

verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of
$76716. t- â¢*'Â¦'â¢-'.'--Â¦- i '
BrXh Risfion and Yates are farmers,
who reside near Napa. The cause of the
suit was a quarrel over some chickens
On May 23 last Risdon went to Yates'
place and told him that, he wanted Yates
to keep his chickens off his^Risdon's)
place.
The plaintiff testified that Tates, after
this preliminary conversation, hit him
with a club and beat him so that he has
not been able to pursue his farm duties
since. Yates in his own behalf says that
Risrton first struck him, and that he then
"sailed in and hit Risdon sixteen or eight
een times" with his fist; that he tried to
land on Risdon's jaw and knock him out,
but could not.
The trial attracted much attention on

Chiefly owing to the lack of all inter-

there was nothing- to justify the prophecy.

one elsg for over thirty years said:- -
"I have not heard a single -word from

this latest resurrection of the retirement

the bulk of the foreign affairs, which
were formerly so trying. I^do not think
he is very eager to 'retire -and,, what is
more to the point, I feel certain the party
would not allow it unless age made far
greater inroads on his health than it has

SAN JOSE, Aug. 30.â A mysterious leak
age in a water tank, which for some time
baffled the owner of the water, has re
sulted in Charles Ritchie, a farmer; Jane
Doe Ritchie, his wife, and Charles Scott,
a hired man, being charged with steal
ing this common drinking fluid. Com
plaints charging petty larceny have been
issued by Justice Rosenthal. O. P. Mills
is the complainant,' "and he alleges the
theft has been going on for some time,
and that he has lost $49 worth of water.
Mills has the contract for supplying
water to the county for road sprinkling
purposes, and he has a tank opposite the
Ritchie farm on McLaughlln avenue. The
water which was pumped into this tank
mysteriously disappeared, and when thÂ©
sprinkling- wagons drove up there was
none to supply them. . After much inves
tigation and nights of wakeful watching
Mills discovered a pipe leading from his
watering tank into the: Ritchie premises.
He tried to catch Ritchie using the water,
but declares he was unsuccessful, saying
that the* Illegal takers used it only at
night and when sure he was not around.
Yesterday Mills disconnected the pipe at
the tank, and he declares that when they
saw what he had done the three accused
persons threatened him with bodily harm.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C. Aug. SO.â Advices
have been received here from Juneau that
on Saturday last Indians arrived there
with a story. to the effect that the wreck
ed steamer Islander lay in shallow water
intact eight .miles from the scene of the
wreck. The Indians seemed to be certain
of their facts and adhered positively to
the statement that the hulk was that of
the Islander. Speculation was rife in Ju
neau as to what the wreck could have
been, as little- confidence was pjaced in
the story of it being the Islander.
All hope of finding more bodies at the
scene of the Islander disaster has been
abandoned, as the icy waters of the north
seldom give up their dead. The bodies
that nave been found were all supported
by buoyant articles, such as pieces of
wreckage or life preservers.
A court of inquiry Into the loss of the
Islander will begin its sittings here on
Tuesday morning. Captain Gaudin, local
agent of marine; Captain G. J. Cox and
J. A. Thompson, inspector of boilers,
have ' been appointed commissioners | by
the Government. The inquiry, was .or
dered to begin at once. All surviving offi
cers and crew and as many passengers as
are available will be summoned to give
evidence.

-TACOMA, .'Aug. 30.â Bishop Peter -E.
Rowe of the Episcopal^ Church in Alaska
haa returned to Sitka from a fourteeh
months". trip ; .to the . farthest wilds > "of
Northern Alaska. . During this time he has
wandered along the Arctic shores, tra
versedU Bering Sea, Journeyed down the
entire -Yukon,, and. with. a dog team, and
snow,., shoes,*, tramped over 1800 miles -j of
frozen J river and | snowy forests. . His ob
ject was to " spread the gospel of â¢ mercy
among .the; Alaskan . Indians, : who have
been dying-, by '.tens and scores 'during the
past two' years'. Bishop Rowe pronounces
their .'affliction, the grip, and says that it
has not *been' caused, as some
by the; incoming of white men and the
purchase of -the fur robes and clothing
'which' the Indians, formerly possessed. â¢
In the- large Indian village of Port Clar
ence Bishop Rowe found only a few inhab
itants still alive, while the dead were ly
ing * everywhere . unburled. - . Among the
dead: was a native who had been- en
trusted with a herd of 500 reindeer . be
longing to himself and friends. After his
death white men endeavored to get pos
session of the herd, and would -have suc
ceeded but for the -energy of Lieutenant
Jarvis, who united the; herd with the Gov
ernment herd, thus saving it for the na
tives. 'Â¦Â¦ - . ;â¢ , ' .. - , ". *Â¦=
So widespread and terrible has been the
grip Â¦ epidemic : that hardened miners were
appalled and begged Bishop Rowe to aid"
,the sick and dying Indians. .-- /
â¢ At Point Barrow Bishop Rowe found
the best specimens of Alaskan natives he
has seen. â¢ Five hundred had ' gathered
1 there, including a large party fromthe in
terior which 'had'Come down to the coast
to trade and hold" a potlatch. He found
the Esquimo of the Arctic slope very
bright and act! vfe, â¢ instead of stolid and
sluggish, as he had expected. â¢ Â¦
The Bishop believes the United States
Government is -accomplishing great good
by carrying out Dr. - Sheldon Jackson's
ideas in -providing . reindeer- herds and
sending ; the .. cutter Bear to Bering Sea
each summer to look after the natives.
He expresses the opinlon-that the Valdez
trail to the Yukon country should becom
.pleted,"but believes that- it should . termi
nate at the mouth of Xanana River rather
than at Eagle. By striking .the upper
waters of .the ,Tanana, at least 200 miles
of the journey, could be made with boats,"
and both Eagle or Circle could be reached
without difficulty. \ .
In the vWilds , of the Tanana: country
Bishop Rowe found a white man whose
feet had been badly .frozen. three months
before. He had amputated his toes with
a jackknife. the wounds being still un
healed. . For, weeks he had crawled about
alone in the intense cold, getting fuel and.
cooking his food. . . .

Two Men Are Saved From

Social Dispatch to Th- CalL.
SEATTLE, Aug. SO.â John Huston and
Joseph Thiery. the two Alaskan prospec
tors who nearly succumbed to starvation
last month on the banks of the Agiapuk
River, arrived on the Senator yesterday
end ere Elowly recovering from their aw
ful experiences. Huston gives a graphic
cceount of the experiences of his party
between April 24 and July 20. on which
cate George Dean, the third member of
tne party, succumbed to the hunger from
which they had suffered for fourteen days.
The three men arrived from Nome in the
Oood Hope country on April Â£4. In the
American River district, whither they
crifted, their provisions gave out and it
v.as determined to return to Teller City.
Ihe ilver was too swollen to permit of
their crossing, however, and they were
forced to turn back. For days they
struggled through a swamp. Huston con
tracted fever, Thiery helping him to move,
'ihejvwere six days reaching the hills.
Thiery later found the corpse of a na
tive, wrapped in old. cloth. Under Hus
ton's directions, he made a canvas boat
of the cloth, but to their utter despair,
it proved too rotten and would not float.
Huddled together, they then lay without
hope until July 20. when in the effort to
drink a cup of water. Dean, who was 52
years old, collapsed and died. It was
Thiery who asked Huston:
"'How do you think George "would eat?"
The horrible suggestion exercised an
equally horrible fascination on the starv
ing men, and finally they cut a strip of
flesh from the dead man and ate it. They
subsisted on this for fourteen days, till
they were found by a party of prospectors
and^rescued.
Dean had a wife and four children In
Canton. Ohio. While Thiery returns to
his old home in Davenport, Iowa. Huston
will return to his old occupation as a boat
carpenter.

- Information comes from Quatsino by the
steamer Queen City, -which arrived from the
west coast last night, 'that the Indians In that
locality are once more in a state of Jubilation
over the prospective return of the missing seal
ing schooner Pioneer, given up years ago as
lost with all on board. The belief which they
are "cherishing is. that the crew and Indian
hunters have these many years been in a
"Skookum House" in I â¢"Stahlllalee" (Russia).
They have been there four years, the story
goes, and will be home in another Â¦ twelve
month. They were discovered, it is alleged, -by
a party arriving at Fort Rupert, which has
since spread the news far and wide among the
Indians. "Whether or not the tale haa any
foundation the fact remains that the mere
story has created the greatest excitement
among the Indians and - they have 'already
started to make preparations for a "hyas"
(potlatch) . in celebration of the. return-, of Â» the
long-lost ones.,- Â¦ , Â¦Â¦ -..â¢' Â¦ - ' . .
â¢ Less than six months ago the Indians of Quat
sino gave it out that the schooner was seen
drifting off shore with the skeleton remains of
the crew in the hold and lashed to the rigging
of the â¢ craft. The story went the rounds of
the whole coast and In San Francisco was
given particular prominence by all the papers
In conclusion, however, it might be said that
the mysterious disappearance of the Pioneer
with her whole crew on . her return from
Bering Sea a number of years ago has never
been explained. . . ' .

WAS THE PLAN
More than a half-dozen times Carter
saw the swinging arm of the referee j
sawing off the seconds. And he never fal
tered after it. Rising to his feet, -his
brain clouded from the clouting admin
istered by Gardner, Carter would save
himself again and again from a knock
out. Once the gong came to his rescue.
This was at the end of the seventeenth
round when six seconds were tolled off
and the supine pugilist lay dazed on the
ring floor. Carter's gameness was as
splendid an exhibition as Gardner's clev
er, cautious fighting. , . _
All through the flght Gardner seemed to
have the best of it, but his opponent's
unexpected recuperation after unbroken
hammering made him extremely danger
ous. Carter's thirst for punishment must
There were times when he was bowled
over by a fierce, cutting right-hand blow
and the crowd, lost In frenzied ecstasy,
was ready to leave the Mechanics' j Pa
vilion satisfied and contented beyond
measure in having seen more than the
fondest hopes had anticipated. \Carter
was no hanger-on. When it looked the
darkest for him he would suddenly re
cover his ebbing physical force and fight
back with. a reserve strength that made
the ending of the contest always uncer
tain, if not doubtful.
â¢ x Carter Marvelously Game.
Knocked down time and again, bleeding
profusely from nose and mouth, face and
lips swollen to an unnatural thickness,
Carter came up to the scratch for medi
cine, which under ordinary prize-ring con
ditions would have leveled a half-dozen
fighters. Gardner's wicked >uppercuts, his
right-hand cross play and his left jolty
swings on face and body had made a
chopping block of his game opponent.
Sheer grit was all that kept Carter on
his feet round after round.
WHEN Kid Carter was knocked
flat on his back last night In
the eighteenth \ round of his
fight with George Gardner the
: t \ *-â¢ ' f crowd was f standing on tip toe,
sputtering, shouting, cheering. That was
the end of the fastest, hottest and fiercest
pugilistic contest ever seen in -this city
and perhaps anywhere at any time. Gard
ner gained a signal victory for genuine
fighting ability; Carter builded a few ad
ditional stories on his reputation for
gameness.
"I am interested In this matter," said
President Burns to-night, "as the big
strike is affecting all lines of business.
Including the window glass trade. My
purpose is to get the two sides together
and start the mills. If President Schwab
is still opposed to my plan of arbitration,
I will request him to suggest whatever
modifications he desires. Anything will
be acceptable if the United States Steel
Corporation car. be induced to arbitrate
and get the mills started."
The editorial In the current Issue of the
Labor "World, the organ of the Interna
tional Tin Workers' Protective Associa
tion, and the mouthpiece of the Pitts
burg district of the Mine Workers' Union
and the Pattern Makers' Association, Is
a long and bitter attack on President
Shaffer, and demands his impeachment
for calling the present strike. The de
mand for the Â«n)peachment Is made be
cause it Is charged Shaffer compelled the
eteel workers to violate contracts, be
cause he expelled the Chicago men and
revoked their charter without a constitu
tional bearing, and because the whole
gtrike Is unconstitutional and has brought
ruin and wreck to men who have made
the Amalgamated Association. The edi
torial gives twenty-four reasons whj
President Shaffer should be impeached.
Notwithstanding the report from - New
York that no conference has been held
or arranged for between C. M. Schwab
and Simon Burns, looking to arbitration,
the latter has not relaxed his efforts In
this direction.
The details of the conference of the
Milwaukee"** committee and the Amal
gamated officials have not yet been di
vulged, but the fact that the committee
is here at all" would indicate that the Bay
View strikers are uneasy. *J.- D. Hickey
and J. E. Coope of the committee have
been here since Monday, but their pres
ence has not been generally known. The
general belief is that the main object of
the committee's visit is to arrange some
compromise by which the Bay View plant
may resume. President Shaffer, on the
contrary, says the two men did not come
here as representatives of the Bay View
ledge. They are simply here, he says, as
Individual members of the Amalgamated
Association to explain in person the rea
eon for their action in. regard to the gen

PITTSBURG, Pa., Aug. 30.â "While there

Then came the flght between Kid Mc-
Fadden, fresh and a shade or. two lighter
than rosy, and Tom Herman. For two
rounds Â¦â¢ Herman seemed' to be - in the
flght, -, but after that he i clung on un
til the eighth, when the - referee wisely
stepped in and * gave the decision , to Â¦ Mc-
Fadden. 'Â¦ In the first round Herman land
ed a right. cross on McFadden's head and
the Kid ; took ; the limit of the j count.' All
that can be said of Herman's 1 fighting is
that he showed' a splendid spirit, of game
ness while in a tottering condition for six
rounds. One of the side-light diversions of
the ; flght was the characteristic," graceful
and delicate Â¦ repartee between Jim Neil
and Kid - McFadden during the entire
fight. Neil occupIedT'a box close to Â¦ the
ring. - - _ Â¦ j : /Â¦ ;' - .; ;.
The cork was pulled in the fistic bottle
when Kid "Williams and Henry Lewis
stepped toward the center of the ring at
the direction of ., Referee Jack Kitchen.
Williams forced matters for" the first six
rounds, but after; that cooled perceptibly
and gave Lewis many chances to do the
fighting, but the colored man did not
pluck the opportunity. The flght was of
the scrappy nature at times and the de
cision, which was given . to Williams at
the end of the tenth round, received but
a divided approbation. Williams did a
bit more fighting than Lewis, who played

seemed twhave no bounds. Gardner's next

Then came the beginning of the end, the
seventeenth. Carter, weakened by the
loss, of blood and the severe slow-fire
roasting, ran into a left and right. Gard
ner saw his chance "and he shot in blow
after blow on Carter's face. He ham
mered him from one end of the ring to the
other, . never resting, but always forcing
Carter from him after a clinch and then
repeating the fusillade of blows. Second

He ate it in big mouthy chunks and came
back for moreâ until the eighteenth round
when his seconds rushed into the. ring to
pack' him to his corner after the referee
had waved at Gardner. as the winner. As
a diversion in gameness Carter,: limpid
and with hands down, would take blow
after blow and then, when it was thought
that ; the end -had come, would suddenly
'recover, fight on and. wind up the round
in a whirlwind finish. This is what the
crowd fed its excitement upon and .the
appetite grew with each bit of sensational
fistic thumping.
Gardner Begins the Battle.
Alec Creggains'did the talking to Gard

Qus Rtihlin were* of counsel >fftr Carter.
Hardly had Referee Jack Kitchen cleared
the ring for action when the -men were
at work, cutting out a hot pace. - .
In the second round Gardner began the
cross-fire of his dangerous right, and Car
ter's face showed the effects. "When the
gong sounded the Kid was the worse for
the wear and tear of battle. - Then the
players of the under dogâ for Carter was
a 10 to 7 favoriteâ began to breathe more,
freely and urge their man from the seats.
Two rounds later Gardner skipped about
lively, blocking and darting in; the fear
ful right with telling force. Carter seem-,
ed to get weaker and weaker by slow
gradation. The fifth was fierce" and torrid,
with Gardner doing all the fighting, . so
much in fact that he exhausted his force
and allowed Carter to end the - round
strong and working. . -. : .
That Stiff Right Punch.
It was weir oh in the eighth round when
Gardner picked his adversary right off the
limb. 'The right arm shot out and 'Carter
was bowled over. - The timekeeper . began
counting, but Carter was not such- an
easy mark as this. At the ninth swing he
was on his feet, and then Gardner reaU

There was no slowing up on either side
and the fight progressed earnestly and
evenly, until the eleventh. . Feeling gay
and strong the Kid then' started his close

ner's shot over, again Carter fell upon his
haunches and again he arose to his feet
to continue the battle where he had been
forced to .leave- it. Â¦ "Smother,',' . cried
Kelly from the; corner, and Carter
"smothered" the best way he could. He

The question at issue was -whether, in
view of the recent decision of the United
States Supreme Court, Â¦ this Â» judgment
might be paid from- the general appro
priation or carried to Congress for a spe
cific . appropriation. The â¢ judgment Â¦ Â¦ ob
tained by the ; plaintiffs \ was " for. $14,597,
which includes the sum 'of $1509 Â¦ interest
and $90 costs. After referring to the case
of.Lascelles & Co., which was similar to
the one under consideration and de
cided by the Comptroller, in July.last, he
says:. ,. , : ," . j \ <â¢>, i \'/-i r
.The 1 * only -'difference between, the case under
consideration and that case,' is that in the
former Lascelles & Co. had not recovered Judg
ment against the United States or the Collector
of Customs for the duties so wrongfully exacted
and paid by them under protest. . It would seem
to the ordinary, mind that it would be a trav
esty on justice to refund duties illegally ex
acted where a Judgment had not been obtained
and to refund under exactly similar conditions
where the persons seeking the refund had been
diligent and had 'their rights ascertained and
settled In the highest court in the land. If
there 'is an appropriation available to paj du
ties illegally exacted, then it follows ex rcl.
that the ascertainment- of the fact of the ille
gal exaction of such duties and the ascertain
ment of their . amount by the judgment of a
court, the only . tribunal that can finally â¢ and
conclusively settle these questions, would, not
and could not have the effect to nullify the ap
propriation. : Â¦
It is perfectly clear to me. that when section
Â£99. R. S.. and the act of 1873 are considered
with reference to section 3689, R. S., providing
for the refund to importers of the excess of de
posits for unascertained duties or other moneys
paid under protest,' that section 3689 carries an
appropriation available > to pay. "Judgments of

Â¦WASHINGTON, Aug. 26, 1901.
Dear Admiral: Your personal letter of the
24th deserves an immediate reply. You say
substantially that there is no foundation for
the statements attributed to you as having
been set forth In an Interview afterward pub
lished in the Boston Record, and lately made
the subject of a communication from Rear-
Admiral Schley to the department. Ton evi
dently have read the correspondence between
the admiral and the department, as published
last week in the newspapers. The depart
ment, let me assure you, has no purpose of
relieving you of this duty. It has implicit
confidence In your sense of justice \ and fair
mlndedness. Should the counsel for Rear Ad
miral Schley proceed to offer to the court ob
jection to you, it will be for the court it*elf
to decide the question of your competency to
sit as a member. . Were your letter official.
Instead of being merely personal. I should
refer it to the Judge advocate of the court,
to be laid before the court. I would like to
know if you have any objection to my giving
to the public your frank and manly letter In
the event that it shall seem desirable to ' do
so. What you have said only confirms me
in the belief that the department has been
fortunate in selecting you as the third mem
ber of the court.
Kindly accept the assurance of my personal
esteem and believe me, yours Â¦ truly, Â¦ -
FRANK W. HACKETT.
Rear Admiral Howison, U. 8. N., Tonkera,

Acting Secretary's Reply.
I have no recollection of the gentleman re
porting for the Boston Record and I do not
approve of his public statement as mine. I can
not say that I have not discussed with ac
quaintances matters published in the newspa
pers relating to our navy's success as well as
the unfortunate disputes so widely commented
on. There are few or no persons In the navy
or In our country who have not dally discussed
these newspaper articles. 1
From the papers It appears that Admiral
Schley has strong doubts as to my fitness to
fairly judge this case with Admirals Dewey and
Benham. As it is a case of grave importance
to those concerned and to the country, I am de
sirous of giving my little help to clear away
the troubles. The duties of members of courts
martial and courts of Inquiry are not sought or
desired by officers. While I feel highly honored
by the department's selection of myself for this
duty, it Is anything but a pleasant task to sit
In Judgment on brother officers. However, the
honor of the selection and the unpleasantness
of court duties do not enter Into the reasons for
my now writing to say to you, personally, three
things, viz.: ': ' ."
First â To reassure you that I am not 'respon
sible for and did not give out such an Interview
as Is alleged In the dispatches from Boston and
as stated in the newspapers to have been men
tioned by Admiral Schley In a recent letter to
the department.
Secondâ If, however, the department feels
that the cause of the nÂ»ry and Justice will be
better served by relieving me from duty on the
court, I am entirely ready to withdraw volun
tarily or to have the department relieve me
upon its own Initiative.
Thirdâ If. on the other hand, the' department
knowing all the circumstances, desires that ' I
should perform the duty I am entirely ready to
perform It and can, upon my conscience and
oath, do my duty as a member of the court
"without partiality" as the law requires. Yours
sincerely and respectfully,
H. L. HOWISON.

Hon. Frank W. Hackett, Washington, D. C.
TVTien the news of our navy's success at Ma
nila and again at Santiago reached Boston the
people there were not behind the rest of the
United States in giving honor and praise to the
navy and to the commanders In chief of the
fleets. The enthusiasm of the population in
praise and honor of the officers and men en
gaged at Santiago lasted for some time, until
later, when the troubles commenced as. to where
the credit and honors should go for the success
for this engagement. It is no news to the navy
to cay 'that where all do their duties thje first
honors for success go to the officer in chlef x com
mand. Censure for failure also belongs to him.
This newspaper cutting in question contains a
statement In which It Is said that I made a
comparison between Schley and- Sampson, un
favorable to Schley. The word "respected." as
used by the reporter, is seldom or never em
ployed by navy men in comparing the qualities
possessed by officers, and I am sure I could
never have said this as he reports, nor said that
Schley had the reputation of being nervous and
hot-headed In the Naval Academy. One may
say that an officer stands higher in his class, if
true; another may stand higher In scientific at
tainments, while another be distinguished for
eminent diplomatic and social qualities, while
all under discussion are of' good standing and
proficient in their necessary professional calling.
References to the Navy.
I believe the service knows, as I do, .that I
do not attempt to make public speeches, write
for magazines or papers or make public utter
ances on navy or other subjects. It has ' been
Impossible to avoid the visits and questions of
representatives of newspapers while serving at
important stations and at times when the navy
has been so busily employed.

DRAWING NEAR
Both racers are at their moorings in
the harbor to-night, fit for the fray. The
Constitution has been put in the best of
trim by her designer. Nat Herreshoff.
The mainsail that was first tried In the
Seawanhaka races remained, as it is by
far the best of all. The new boat was
given a trial spin down the bay to-day,
and the sails had a good stretching. The
head staysails, which slackened when the
boat was hauled out, were also set taut,
and all the rigging was given a thorough
overhauling.
The Columbia also was given final
touches to-day, and both boats are now
ready to show the best speed there is
in them.
Sir Tipmas Lipton will be a spectator
of the race on Monday. He has accepted
an invitation to be the guest of Commo
dore Ledyard at dinner on that day, and
the event will be the first official welcome
to the Britishers by the officers of the

they will take into consideration all pre

much difficulty In selecting the American
boat. Out of sixteen races already fin

are the two boats In the matter of speed
that many good yachtsmen say that

will still be a hard task to choose be

ball to an uncovered base, but later re
deemed himself by a sensational catch.

first inning.
After this Whalen himself went bad.

and showing a fulsome generosity for fur
nishing free transportation. In the fourth
and fifth innings Oakland put on another
roll of runs. After the first inning the
game was listless, presenting no element
of a contest.
In the eighth Josh Reilly put the ball
over the center field fence, giving the lo
cal team a stroke on the board. Score:

Wbalen was. sacrificed on -a" field of er
rors In the first inning at Recreation
Grounds yesterday afternoon. When the
Dudes took to the sticks the fun began
for Ewing. Hit twice, Whalen received
such poor support that six runs were
counted for Oakland before the Dudes
were forced to go to the field.

stretch, but when a few hundred yards
from the finish the Alamedas:spurted,^In
creasing their stroke to 44. .Owing to the
distance between- the- boats (about. 000
yards) it was very difficult to tell which
led. The Alamedas had the Inside course
and made a magnificent finish. Â¦ As the
boats came hoine it was : seen that .they
â¢were nose and nose and when ; the 1 signal

handsomest piece of linen ever seen on
a cup challenger, when it was quickly
lowered and at 1:45 a balloon sail was
substituted for the working one. v With

FAMOUS HORSES OF THE CLASSIC FUTURITY.
Yankee, owned by-J. E. Madden. When
Pitts burg Phil bet J30.000 on his colt Chll
ton the Madden, youngster went out and
won galloping, since which time his
stock has had an upward tendency.
Unfortunately, Allan-a-Dale and Endur
ance by Right, the pick of the "Western
division, and both top notchers, were not
entered. .The scarlet of A. H. & D. H.
Morris will ; be represented by Compute,
the sturdy chestnut colt, by Hanover-
Correction, victor for the $15,000 Foxhall
stakes, when he downed Hyphen, Gold
smith and other good ones. August Bel
mont's Masterman made a very credit
able showing in the Saratoga special, and
is a possibility. Hyphen, which cost $5000
as a yearling, will sport the colors of the
Pittsburg millionaire, S. S. Brown.
. J. B. Hagginhas two â¢ ellglbles. Water
power and Remorse. The Keenes will
choose from Port Royal, . Telescope and
Reformer. Clarence Mackay, a newcomer
to the turf, laid down a neat sum for
Heno, and while the game looks hard the
colt might furnish a surprise. Barney
Schreiber, well, known in California, will
probably take a long chance with Dewey,
a son of Imp. Sain, and .his many friends
wish him success.
The field gives promise of being a large
one. William C. Whitney will be'inter
ested partially in the success of three
RICHEST of all American turf
two-year-old prizes,' no more aris
tocratic.field of . youngsters ever
faced the starter than that which
"will sport silk in the great Fu
turity stake this afternoon* at Sneepshead
Bay. It will be worth between $45,000 and
$50,000. and for weeks the cream and
flower of the big Eastern stables have
been receiving special preparation for the
supreme test. In the past it has been
captured by such illustrious turf heroes
as Proctor Knott. Potomac. His High
ness, Mo^ello, the dead Domino and Re
quital, and carries with It perpetual glory
as well as wealth. Â« This marks the last
year the race will be decided â¢ over tho
short course, for next, season it will be
run on the new Futurity course, full six
furlongs, and will be worth at least $75,
ooo. "
different starter?','.' should all be sent io
the barrierâ Nasturtium, ..Blue Girl . and
Goldsmith. Mr. ; Whltney purchased the
running qualities* of Nasturtium from A.
L. Aste for $25,000. and J. B.: Haggin gave
the ex-bootblack owner, an additional
$25,000 for. | the son r. of - imp. Â¦' Watercress
when his racing days shall. have been*fln-
Ished. Blue Girl, winner of the $20,000
Great Trial ' stakes, is owned jointly by
J. E. Madden srnd \V. C. Whitney. She
is : a â¢ daughter of Sir . Dixon . and Bonnlo
Blue II,, and . is likely to be the actual
favorite. For the $15,000 Saratoga special
the filly was beaten a head by Goldsmith,
owing, it Is , claimed, to the. tardy move
made by her rider, Shaw.
Goldsmith, by imp. Meddler, .'was bred
and . raised at the "Whitney -farm. Pps
sessed of bulldog courage, he has been a
most consistent performer. Opinion ap
pears to.be reserved as -to the quality of

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 30.â There Is a
strike at the big. hop fields of the Horst
Brothers, about seven miles east of this
city, and strikers from San Francisco,
who came to the Interior in search of
employment, are credited with having
caused it The hop growers had agreed
to pay the pickers at. the rate of 80 cents
per 100 pounds, but this was not satis
factory to the San Francisco men, who
spread ~a movement for $1 per 100 pounds.
The demand was not acceded to and
about thirty men were Induced to quit
Â¦work. Frank Van Cott, a laborer from
Woodland, declares that he was led Into
the strike against his will and that in
consequence he is out of a job.
"I was making over $2 per day at hop
picking," said Van Cott to-day, "and was
satisfied with my pay. A lot of strikers
from San Francisco got work in the
fields. They had been there only a little
â¢while when they began agitating a strihe
for $1 per 100 pounds. At noon Wednes
day one of the San Francisco agitators
informed me that a perfect organization
had been completed. On Thursday morn
ing -when the time came to force the is
sue, the San Francisco strikers who had
been doing all the talking picked up their
baskets and went to work. We Northern
California workers, who had been 7 duped
into striking, were left behind out of a
joo. There are about thirty of us in
this fix now. There are, I should say,
100 strikers from San Francisco now pick
ing hops in Horst Brothers' field."
The manager of the Red Cross employ-"
ment office in this city said to-day, that'
a great number of. strikers from San
Francisco had secured employment In the
country through his office. As a conse
quence of this increased" supply of out

pute was brought up. at the meeting of

of exhibiting a" deadly weapon in a rude
and threatening manner, appeared before

that VAshcroft acted in s self-defense : the

doing so he said:
"Without any - further comment 1 1 will
simplv say that from the standpoint pre

After the Judge had written out the

the defendant, said 'he desired the Judge
to understand that he , objected to -the

motion to order the Sheriff to serve the

4 BOUT a dozen armed men, whose names are, .unknown
t\ to the police, appeared. early yesterday morning at the
ZA\ foot of Fifth street and proceeded to board the schooner
A jV South Coast, which is about to take on a cargo of lum
ber. /They; were met by a special officer,, who was in
charge of the boat, and one- of â¢ the non-union : crew. '! When
asked what they wanted the ringleader of the crowd, after dis
playing two \ revolvers, announced that , they were after the
non-union crew and thceatened to kill 'everybody- aboard If
there was' any interference.;- .V' : ' :' - Â¦â¢ \>'
The special. officer, realizing that the men meant; business,
summoned several of the. crew and prepared for a battle. One
of the Invading niob divining his purpose promptly seized him
and endeavored to get possession of his pistol. ? ,>,,
After a short struggle the special, with the "assistance of one
of the crew, managed to throw the fellow Into the water. Hta
companions then charged on the special with cries of "Kill
him." - â¢ .' * Â¦' .'.".'
.- Realizing that his life was In danger the special drew, his
pistol and fired into the crowd. The members of the attacking
party returned the lire and though over twenty shots were ex
changed no one was hurt. . ', â¢
After exhausting his ammunition the special was forced to
retreat and the " assailants '. at once took possessions of- the
schooner. Seizing, the seven non-union men of the crew they
forced them to follow. They took the thoroughly frightened
men to a place on East street, where, they, .compelled them "to
swear allegiance to the cause of 'unionism. -Â¦"".. 'â¢ â¢: : -" " \;
One of the crew, a man named Anderson, -criticized the ac
tion of the mob v/horeupon.he was released. â¢As he walked
up- Townsend street to Fifth. he was suddenly attacked by two
men and beaten into insensibility. After recovering conscious
ness he-told the police that his ' assailants /-were- two -.of tho
men who compelled the crew toleave the schooner.'- He claims
,ihat after being knocked down one of , the' ruffians went
"hrough his pockets, securing, only a few. dollars.
The police have a good, description of the men . and every
effort is being made to run : them down. " , : .'-â¢' V- Â¦
Accordlng to Anderson he was sleeping In. his bunk. wnen
he was suddenly awakened by the report of ".'a pistol. . As he
appeared on deok a number of other shots were fired, and fear
ing for his own life he sought' safety, behind: the cargo of-lum
ber. After the shooting he was hauled from his place of con
cealment by the gang and compelled to walk ashore.
The rest of the crew soon appeared, accompanied by the at
tacking party and were: compelled to leave the vessel. They
were then marched to the East street resort, where theywevo
threatened with death' if they returned 1 to the schooner. After
being held prisoners for several hours they were liberated. .
Last evening the entire crew returned to the vessel under a
heavy police guard. Officers were- placed aboard' the? schooner:
to repel any further attacks by. strikers or their sympathizers.
Information reached police headquarters late yesterday after
noon that about twenty men, supposed to be strikers, were
lurking about the loot of Fifth: street, apparently prepared
to make another attempt to secure the crew of the " South
Coast. Captain Wlttman and several of his men went to the
scene and dispersed the crowd after a short conflict. One of
the men vigorously resisted the efforts of the police to drive
the gang away arid it was found necessary,, to club him into
submission. It is claimed that the men intended to scuttle the.'
schooner and were circumvented only by the prompt arrival of
the police. '-','Â¦Â¦
The reports of the violence committed
on the persons in Government employ be
came so numerous that the question of
calling upon the commandant at. the Pre
sidio for a squad of soldiers to protect
them was brought up and for a time it
seemed that the presence of the regular
soldier on the water front would soon be
felt. A council was held and it was de
termined that such a course would be
pursued unless the city authorities gave to
the transport dock the same protection
afforded the rest of the water front.
from work. The statement that they were
Government employes and were not there
fore connected with either the unions or
the shipping men proved no protection,
and they were given the same treatment
as the men who took the places of the
strikers formerly employed by private in
dividuals or firms.
The strikers retired and remained away until shortly "after
midnight, when they returned and fired about forty shots
through the big gate. The men on the inside fired but once
In return, and Sergeant Poulson says he is sure the bullet hit
one of the strikers. - . .
After the second attack regular police were sent from the
Hall of Justice to guard the place from the outside. ?','
Special Policeman Hebart was the. only one of the stable
force injured. He was shot twice in the leg, one bullet lodging
in the kneecap. The bullets were removed and the wounds
dressed later by Dr. E. H. Bonn of 1027% Market street, 'who
went to the barn in response to a telephone message.
Hebart says that he saw several of the strikers fall, and
other of the men in the stables corroborate him.
About fifteen responded. ,In a body they charged the strik
ers. The latter being out of ammunition were obliged to re
treat. Poulson.'. and his men then returned to the stablqs,
where armed sentries were posted at Â¦ every door.
Sergeant of Specials, Poulson and Special Policeman Dun
can, who had been making the rounds of some adjoining prop
erty In a buggy, attracted by the shooting, drove to the scene
of action. The big gate was opened, they- drove in, and, turn
ing the buggy over to a teamster, Poulson called for volun
teers to clear the street. .' \
Both sides were unprepared fora protracted engagement,
and after some two or three hundred shots had been ex
changed firing ceased for lack of ammunition.
According to the &tory told by Hebart and the ' men* with
him, the strikers suddenly opened fire with a shotgun loaded
with buckshot. . This was followed by a volley of revolver
shots. Hebart and the teamsters with him returned the fire
and by the time .they had emptied 'their guns into the crowd
of strikers they were reinforced by the little army of non
union teamsters in the stable. About thirty of these were
armed. They poured through the small door in the big grate,
took their stand on the sidewalk and blazed away at the
strikers, who were now shooting' from all directions.
The headquarters of tho striking teamsters is in the imme
diate neighborhood of the stables. Soon after Hebart stepped
outside a large crowd of strikers gathered^ on the opposite side
of the street.
There were some forty non-union teamsters and two special
policemen in the stables at the time of . the attack, which oc
curred abouf half-past .8 o'clock. One of the specials, A. E.
Hebart, was standing on the sidewalk just outside one 'of the
stable gateways in company with two non-union teamsters. It
is part of Hebart's duty to watch against fire both outside and
inside the barn, and it was for this purpose, he says, he was
on the street last night. , Â¦
received two wounds and a number of. the strikers are
supposed to have sustained injuries more or. less serious. Two
separate attacks were made. .
A HOT engagement was fought last night at the stables
of the Overland Freight Transfer Company on Bryant
. street, between Fourth and Fifth. " Over two hundred
and fifty shots were exchanged. A special' policeman
Several reports of a like character were
made during the day. and some of the men
threatened to quit unless they were af
forded protection- Even the launches
employed about the transport dock
came in for a chare of the stoning. On
one of the launches a fireman who is
known to be a non-union man is employed,
and for this boat the strikers seemed to
have a particular hatred. In passing the
various wharves along the front the men
In the launch were frequently exposed to
* hail of rocks, and even when tied up at
the wharf the landing- of a heavy brick
on the canvas superstructure of the boat
was not an infrequent occurrence.
Several of the men employed at the dock
have been assaulted on their way to 'and
Launches Are Stoned.
Wednesday night the men were com
pelled to work overtime In getting a cargo
abDard one of the transports. They re
mained on thÂ« dock until 10 p. m;, and
then started for their homes. They had
been accustomed to walk along the front
without the protection of the police, rely
ing on the fact that the strikers Hnew
they were employed by the Government
and would not molest them. Eight of them
walked up Market street together, and
were not even hailed by the pickets sta
tioned along the front. At the corner of
Market and Steuart streets, however, they
were surrounded by a mob of fifty i men
and had it not been for the arrival of two
police officers they would have been badly
beaten. As* it was three of them were In
jured and were taken to the Harbor Hos
pital to have a number of minor bruises
dressed.
The attack on these eight men was the
commencement of the persecution of the
Government employes. Early the next
morning several of them were stopped on
their way to work on the dock and Wad
they not been fleet of foot would have
been roughly handled. A few hours later
the men sX work discharging the Hancock
reported that th*Â»y were prevented from
accomplishing any work through the ac
tions of a lot of men supposed to be
strikers, who were throwing stones at
them from the neighboring wharves.
The matter was placed before the Mayor
in this light, and as a result four police
officers have been detailed for duty at
the transport dock, which up to the pres
ent has been left unguarded except by
the men who have held for some time
past the positions of watchmen and gate
keepers.
During the first few days of the strike
little attention was paid to the men em
ployed by Uncle Sam. The leaders of the
strike stated that they had no quarrel
with the United States and would not in
terfere with the men working on board
of or loading Government vessels. In view
cf this fact it was not thought that any
of Chief Sullivan's men were needed at
the wharf, ana Â¦ it was considered the
only portion of the front not affected
by the strike. Several transports arrived
and departed without interterence from
the strikers, and it was not until violence
became the weapon of the laboring men
vhat the men en the dock were brought
into the controversy.
Exemption Enjoyed at First.
The action of the army officers was tak
en only after a conference lasting for
several hours between Colonel Long, U.
S. A., depot quartermaster, and the army
officers connected with the transport ser
vice. They were forced to take this
stand, as tor the last few days the strik
ers have been paying particular attention
to the men at work on the army dock
as laborers, stevedores and mechanics and
have tried by the use of lorce to pre
vent them from performing their duties.
The Government is not concerned in any
ray with the strike, and does not care
whether union or non-union men are em
ployed so long as the vessels in the trans-.
port service are kept running regularly.
The officials contend that the preserving
of peace under the conditions existing at
present is a matter that conies under, the
lurisdictlon of the Police Department, and
that in view of this fact the men should
be furnished protection in the same man
ner as the men who are engaged at a pri
vate or State wharf.
The Mayor \*-.is asked to state positively
Â¦whether or not he could Â¦ spare the offi
cers necessary to prevent the strikers in
juring the hands employed at the foot of
Kolso'm street. It had been determined
by the army officials that in case the
Mayor could not see his way clear to or
der to the Government dock a squad of
policemen a force of regulars would be
brought in from the Presidio and sta
tioned around the Government wharf.
The Mayor readily consented, however,
to place four of Chief Sullivan's men at
the disposal of the army officers, so that
all necessity for the calling out of even a
small force of regulars for duty in the
strike-infected district was removed.
yesterday for police protection
for the men employed on the transport
dock, intimating that in case he could
not comply with the request the officials
of the transport service would place the
Government property and the men en
gaged in handling Government freight
under the protection of United States
troops.

Dr. Osborne, the dismissed .superintendent, has

the feeble-minded, but he is something more than

is necessary to enable one. to understand them or to
help them. It is therefore in the highest degree im
portant that the superintendent in, whose charge they
are'placed be a man who by nature and by training is
fitted for the task. To place them under control of
one who. takes the office solely for the salary would
be something like the commission of a crime against
to any degree of mental strength. Their proper main-
tenance and training is one of the" saddest problems
with which humanity has to deal. These little ones
have none of that brightness, ; beauty and promise
which make childhood attractive and give promise of
future lives of usefulness, "and as a consequence they
do not excite the usual love and fondness which are
60 freely accorded to happier children. Compara

The offense committed in the removal of Dr. Os

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
THE REMOVAL OF OSBORNE/

â¢ It is probable that reither. the parents nor the chil

* Sociologists seek ; far afield for th^ causes of exist-'
ing'unrest.. Perhaps a nearer examination of the
relative thrift and economy of the people in that'
Golden Age and this Age of Discontent would re-'
veal the" reason. Â¦,.; , ..
Although this excellent method of increasing the
purchasing power of .wages has not been adopted by
the unions in. this country, a day's wage now will buy
more food,, fuel and clothing than it did fifty. years
ago. Instead of his lot .being harder now than then
the laborer's lot is easier. Yet those distant days.are
often referred to as a sort of Golden Age to which
labor longs^ to return. One condition that prevailed
then is less present now. In that period of lower
wages there was/a higher degree of thrift and eco
nomy. It pervaded all classes. In that condition
was laid the foundation of many of the great, for
tunes which arelnow used to excite the discontent of
American workingmen. The heads. of families then
accomplished marvels by thoughtful economy. No
American family played a greater part in the world
than the Fields. The world owes %) Cyrus Field the
submarine telegraph cable. His brother, the Justice,
has left an imperishable, impression upon- our juris
prudence.. Their sister was the mother of another
Justice of the "Federal Supreme Court. There were
seven of them andall had a college education atthe
cost of their fathefr, though his income ' never ex
ceeded six hundred dollars a yqjr, or $1 65 a day!
The family, lived in the old town of Haddam, Conn.,
andwas.a typical American family of that day, and
its seven children got a college education on an in
come less, than unskilled labor gets to-day, for un
skilled labor is in demand in this State at $2 per day!
' Dealing directly \with the producer, his price was
maintained and 'the elements of risk were largely
eliminated. It is of interest to : the fruit producers
of this State to fcno\v~ that in these union stores in
Great<Britain they will 6nd~ a market for all fruit
products that may be used in jams and jellies. It is
probable that dried fruit and fruit pulp could be prof
itably handled in that trade. . â¢ :â¢
The effect upon the laboring population was ex
cellent. They" secured a better and fuller supply of
necessaries at a greatly reduced cost, and the union
store became a feature all over Great. Britain. ..
In the British* Isles the |abor unions early ad
dressed, themselves to this^phase of the interests of
labor, and instituted a system of wholesale purchase
of the leading necessaries of life; The unions *not
only drew.on the domestic supply of these necessaries
but became iarge importers,' 1 drawing on' the 'markets
of the Continent, Australia and 1 the United States.
The real and proper purpose of labor is to gather
to itself the fruits of its toil. Its success in this is
measured by the amount of product for which it can
exchange' the wages of production. This purchasing
power of wages is the real measure of the wage.^-'V^
In this country wages during the ten years preced
ing the Civil War wore less than half the average of
to-day. Measured by "their -purchasing- power they
were about one-third.
IN Europe, where wages are still low, they have
undergone a gradual rise during the last half
century.

PERSONAL MENTION,
It is one of the local traditions that all
the mosquitoes found on Siaten Island are
bred in these land-locked ponds. Accord
ing to some of the oldest inhabitants this
summer has been a -record breaker In the
number of the Insects on the Island. The
frequent i rains and hot, sultry l weather
following them are blamed for the over
production.
Dr. Doty said that he did not want the
Impression to go out that he was fighting
the mosquitoes; of: Staten Island because
they were more numerous there than else
where. Â¦
Selecting a "little -hamlet lying. In the
hollow'of the hills. : back of Clifton., and
known locally as Conpord, Dr. Doty be-
gan his experiments. He found a series
of ponds filled with stagnant water, above
which clouds of mosquitoes . swarm every
evening.* These breeding places of the
pests are without outlets and are known
as Millers. Connors and Bunnei-s ponds.
The three sheets of water are surrounded
by small, frame dwellings, !n which fami
lies of A'orkingmen live.

A man in New York who bit off the end of a cigar
in the smoking compartment of a street car and then
spat it out upon the floor was arrested, for x viplating
the ordinance against expectorating in street gears'
and convicted,. but the Judge who convicted him
said the street car companies should put cuspidors
in the cars where smoking is permitted; so a new
agitation is under way, and it looks as if we would
never have peace. â¢
The Call does nbt hesitate to support their laudable
aims sought in a lawful manner," but will not cease to
deplore, expose and reprehend their lawless acts and
the murderous means they use under the. incitement
of evil advice. ,
The labor unions profess to exist for a lawful pur
pose. We cheerfully admit that their "declared pur
pose is entirely laudable; But they are causing the
public to lose sight of this entirely by merging into
a mob.
One thing is coming surely into wiew. If the ex
ecutive authority- of this city cannot administer the
law and protect personal and property rights the citi
zens themselves will appeal to higher authority for
protection.-
WHen a citizen even dare not let his opinion of a
public matter be printed over his own signature there
is occasion for the invoking of a power which will
protect the lawful rights of the whole people.
On Thursday ovef^ thirty, assaults were made by
strikers on nonunion men. Some of the victims
were beaten and kicked into insensibility. Some of
these x assaults were accompanied by incidents of the
most glaring criminality. Strikers invadea the fore
castle of the ship Highland Light and abducted two
seamen, who were ordered to Â£ake their bundles of
clothing and were forced over the side into a boat.
The}' were, taken to the headquarters of the- Sailors'
Union) where the- engineer's, certificate of one was
taken from him and the clothes of both were seized.
Â¦Then both were taken out and brutally beaten.
When they were rescued and went with : the police
to. reclaim their property it could not be -found.
Now, in that one case, was committed a series of
crimes-the most. serious and the most cowardly.. In
another case the same day a mob of over a hundred
boarded a street car and abducted two non-union
workmen,- after breaking the car windows and terror
izing the passengers. The men were carried away
and have not been he&rd of since. A score >of these
abductions have occurred. The immunity- enjoyed
by the men who do'these things raises a reasonable
doubt whether we have any law in this city that can
protect men in the enjoyment of their legal rights as
American citizens.
By others on strike we are assured that if the secret
ballot were used' in unions the number of strikes
would be much less. The use of the libelous term
"scab" and other opprobrious epithets deters men
from taking a position on open vote which they
would gladly assume under the protection of a secret
ballot. - .
We have no doubt thaf.thi^ workingman expresses
the sincere- conviction of a large part of the -strikers,
perhaps of nearly all who have families to support,
and feel that their obligation to wife and children is
higher than that to the leaders and the. fire-eating
cliques who support them.
THE CALL is^iri receipt of a large number of
letters from strikers. A~ few of these are threat
ening in tone, but the large majority. express
satisfaction with our position and request that we do
riot publish the names of' the writers for, fear of per r
sonal violence. -Where there are exceptions to this
we have no objection .to publishing such letters with
the names of the writers.
-These letters are interesting as evidence. of the ex
tent to which intimidation is used to deprive men of
the lawful enjoyment of personal rights, without
which men are no longer free agents or free men.
One'letter we quote here* at length, without the
writer's name, which we would- be glad to use if, his"
consent were given. He says: '.
'"As an Amerjcan^born 'workman, injured by the
present strike,' I, like hundreds who are .deprived of
work by the general .demoralization of trade, de-'
nounce this strike as one uncalled for and without
justification or excuse except to gratify the evil pro
pensities of some men who are never happy unless
breeding trouble. These are the leaders who are too
lazy to work, but desire to live easy and grow fat on.
the miseries of the thousands of unfortunates Irho are
made by forfe.to enter into these strikes, to their
lasting injury. > The loss to them will' never be re;/
gained, and the sooner the rank and file see this and
act from their own better judgment the better it will
be. Winter is near at hand, and what is this- army
of unemployed going to live on? Has a working
man no individual rights. in a land of liberty that my
forefathers helped de<flarÂ« free? Are~we,to be for
ever dictated to by leaders who do not work, but
manage to get control of our labor organizations,
whereby they draw good salaries out 'of us, and
larger pay in times of trouble like this- which they
cause? Why, in the name of common sense, if we arc
tree, men, do we not act with intelligence and settle
our own affairs in our own best interest?
"Let us get back to the places we have deserted;,
j Let us provide for our families, and act as though
j we had a right to govern ourselves. This is the sen
! timent of hundreds of others who think as I do. in
| this matter.'.' "
SCIENTIFIC WAR ON THE PESKY
MOSQUITO BEGINS IN NEW YORK
i One point of the .Senator's observations deserves
I specialiattention. He said: "It was interesting to
I note the intense interest and pleasure in the steel
strike and the threatened one in the New England
cotton mills. .The newspapers were jubilant in their
, editorials.. They predicted the extension of the. la
bor trouble to all industries] . They claimed that the
contest; was the inevitable outcome of the trusts, and
that home troubles jvould postpone for years the
Yankee industrial invasion and conquest."
From these statements 'it appears that. Europe,
whilenqt yet attempting any concerted action against
our competition, is nonetheless considering'it. Her
people note with satisfaction the divisions that have
unfortunately broken out here between labor and
capital: In that for the present theyhave high hopes.
It-would appear.' therefore, that in the judgment of
our rivals the only thing that can stop our onward
progress toward industrial and comm'ercia^supremacy
will be divisions. among" ourselves. â¢ â¢
< The Senator ridiculed any suggestion that the fric
tion caused, by competition would result in war, for,
as. he sai4,. the relations of European Governments
are too intricate an'd uncertain among themselves for
any oneianrohg them to take? that risk, and combina
tion is impossible. He believes it to "be equally im
possible for them to form an industrial and commer
cial alliance -for the 'exclusion of American; goods,
but, he reports having heard a Russian statesman say:
"Concert of action may be impossible, but Russia, in
response to discriminating- duties, has shown how
each country in its, own way can stop this compe
tition." /V Â¦Â¦ .

completed for the Standard Oil Company
late in 1900 and went from Philadelphia,
to China with a cargo of kerosene. After
discharging at Shanghai she came to Sail
Francisco, making the run in 46 days.
The Astral is very like the Arthur

Democratic Candidates. ; *r- j
There is talk in the r>emocratic camp
of putting forward Supervisor James P.
Booth for Mayor. He is said to be ac
ceptable to the trades unions on account
of his earnest and successful efforts In
behalf of the allied printing trades.
Raphael Weill, who is frequently spoken
of as the man to head the Democratic
municipal ticket, will not accept public
office. Major Hooper of the Occidental
Hotel, who has been mentioned more than
once as a candidate "Who could win out
against Colonel Kirkpatrick of the Palace
Hotel, will not take the Democratic nom
ination. His first reason for declining Is
based on the ground that he is not a
Democrat. Incidentally it is suggested
that Colonel Kirkpatrick is not a Repub
lican. As a readjustment the manager of
the Palace might be placed at the head
of the Democratic ticket and Major
Hooper of the Occidental be selected to
lead the Republicans. General TVarfleld
of the California Hotel, who heads the
aggregation of statesmen, representing
the Forty-third District in the Republl- ;
caa convention, ought to be able to ad
just the differences.

: My- opponent has said that strikes are a
good -.thing. This I deny- with a full con
viction of. their, wrong. ; But '.If they, are good
things why seek Â¦: for ; remedies? Â¦- I say .when
you see a good thing, help it along. -, The : pre
vious speaker said that In the single tax he
had a 'radical remedy, -' a remedy * which ' was
certain of Â¦ averting strikes as It â¢ had . already
done elsewhere. Â¦Â¦' This Â¦ puts the strike in the
position of a healthy; man going Into ' China
town trying to get the smallpox. In ai coun
try where every male citizen . of Â» twenty-one
years and upward, has' a voice- in the gov
ernment, strikes are , reactionary, because they
are on the principle that force or might makes
right. Â¦Â¦â¢:;â¢-Â¦. . Â¦ â¢ Â¦ ,- , Â¦Â¦/ \ -/>
Trade unions have the merit of cultivating
a class consciousness, and. if that was directed
toward v culture of the Â¦ principles of a real
democracy, they would - be very v useful, : but
designing men are perverting their .possible
good by. brutalizing the "worker and encourag
ing him to accomplish by force, inconvenience,
suffering and . privation' of himself . and others
what ought to.be accomplished by reason/"Jus
tice, law and order. \. . .Â¦-,Â¦Â¦
Strikes " are â¢ injurious " not only to those who
participate in- them, but- to the community
or country In which they occur, for they often
force compliance, when compliance means de
struction of an industry. Mr. : Scott," â¢ for in-~
stance, said ne would prove his statement by
his books that -the increase of 12 per cent de
manded by the machinists will ruin his busi
ness. In the absence of any proof toXthe
contrary, we must . take his - word for . the
facts in the. case, and he naturally . comes to
the conclusion that : if . his business is to be
ruined he had better quit, and save what he
nas, than' run the chances of becoming a bank
rupt, and this is the only view , any sensible
business man. can take. Mr. Scott's position
is made .' clearer when we : get. an idea what
trade union dictation has done in England. \ Â¦
No man is opposed to arbitration, i whether
in war or peace,, for arbitration in business is
the- rule of sensible men unless they are so
stubborn- and appeal to the courts or Juries
(which do -precisely the same thing in an
other form), and perhaps. not as equitably as
if they, had' left it , to arbitration. It seems
that the word â¢ compulsory ; is to .some persons
like a red rag to the sight of a Spanish bull'
in the hands of a matadorâ they get wild with
fury and indignation. This,, to my mind, is
nothing- but a sort of mental ; color-blindness
all law is In its very nature Â¦ compulsory,
whether statutory or unwritten.*'
Evolutionism teaches us that the instinct of
self-preservation is . so strong that some in
order to . further self Interests at-e constantly
trying to encroach" on the rights v of â¢ others,
hence, society wants rules and regulations
and this necessity gave rise to and governs
the enactment of statutory law throughout the
wcrld. : So the qualification, compulsory is quite
superfluous and tautological, because all laws,'
whether' written Â¦ or unwritten, , are In- their
very nature to be obeyed. If it were not so
the anarchists' philosophy of abolishing all
laws would be an absurdity, which ideally it
Is not. Â¦â¢ .',Â».Â¦.: "
â¢Dr. Miller' discussed s the condition In
.New Zealand under the "Industrial Con
ciliation, Act," saying that since its
adoption . in 1S94 there 'had not been a
strike in that country.. He referred to
tho experience of France with the "sin
gle tax theory, which another speaker
urged as a panacea for all evils and as
a-., preventive of strikes. The speaker
quoteu" largely from works of- eminent
writers on social problems in support of
h â¢. - contention that strikes could be
avoided by a closer compact' between
employers and employes.

The present disturbed condition of labor
has been under discussion at the Iroquois
Club fof the past three Â¦.weeks. Efforts
have, been made to secure /expressions of
opinion; < not alone ;\ from â¢ labor ::'- leaders,
but - from - students of political economy
Â«os well, v The . debate-was closed- last
night by Dr., John: A. Miller, who. in -a
well considered paper, gave his views as
to the causes of : strikes ;-and their gen
erally disastrous result c upon the strikers.
Dr. Miller spoke in part as follows:
There was another conference last night
of Republican delegates representing anti
boss district delegations. The meeting
took place at Native Sons' Hall on Sev
enteenth street, near Valencia. State
Senator F. W. Burnett presided. The
Thirty-fourth, Thirty-eighth. Thirty
ninth and Forty-first districts ' were offi
cially represented. The Fortieth District
was represented unofficially. There was
no discussion relative to aspirants for of
fice or candidates for the chairmanship
cf the convention. The hope was ex
pressed that concerted action, on the part
of independent delegates would result in
the nomination of capable, clean and de
serving men to fill the municipal offices.
After exchanging views the members
present decided to adjourn the conference
until Friday evening of next week and in
the meantime invite the full delegation
of each district represented to attend.
The invitation will also be extended to
independent delegates in districts other
than those represented last night.
Anti-Boss Republicans
Shortly after the election of Thomas R.
Bard to the United States Senate Sena
tor Perkins readily assented to a sugges
tion that his fellow Senator should name
a successor to John Lynch. Collector of
Internal Revenue. It was deemed best by
Senator Bard that no active steps to
ward a change should be taken until Coi
lector Lynch had served four years. Short
ly after that period of service had ex
pired Senator Bard, at the earnest re
quest of many leading Republicans of
California, decided to recommend Stephen
.Kelly of San Bernardino for the Collec
torship in question, and asked Senator
Perkins to join in the recommendation.
The latter, for reasons best known to
himself, sought to defer action. Senator
Perkins wanted it to be distinctly under
stood that he was not insisting that
Lynch should be retained in office, but
was only contending that the proposed
- change be not made before the meeting
of Congress. It is known- that Senator
Bard has been consistently and urgently
impressing upon the senior Senator the
advisability of an early change.
Indications point to an adjustment of
the Question on the lines presented by
Senator Bard. Senator Perkins begins to
see that he cannot afford to be placed In
the light of indorsing a boss faction of
the party which Lynch represents. The
fact has been clearly impressed on Per
kins 1 mind that he will lose the support
cf many stanch and true friends in South
ern California if he persists in his oppo
sition to Senator Bard's course in refer
ence to the internal revenue office. The
following dispatch from Los Angeles sig
nifies that an adjustment is in sight:
LOS ANGELES, Aug. SO.â It was ru
mored to-day that Senators Perkins and
Bard have finally agreed upon the suc
cessor of John C. Lynch as Internal Rev
enue Collector for the First District, and
that Stephen Kelly, at present Postmaster
at San Bernardino, Is really to be the ap
pointee. Mr. Kelly was in the city to
day, but declined to discuss the matter.
~- Kis most intimate friends are saying that
Senator Perkins has given his Consent to
the proposed change, however, and it has
been agreed among the friends of Senator
Bard that Senator Perkins shall adopt the
tactics he is at present following by "ral
lying" the opposition to Lynch as -long as
possible and at the proper time coming
out into the open for Kelly. A Republi
can leader, hi discussing the matter to
day, said:
"Why should not Perkins do just what
he Is doing. The 'organization' has al
ways handed it to him just the same way.
The leaders of that faction have never
supported Senator Perkins at Sacramento
and they will not be for him in 1903, un
less they are compelled. Perkins knows
that, and you may be sure that he. Sena
tor Bard, James McFadden and Stephen
Kelly at present understand each other
thoroughly." 'Â¦--, â¢

"During the week there have been two arri

Our. deliveries thl3 week are about twenty-fiva
per cent less than last week: at the same tlm*
there is ample here for . current requirements
The amount : discharged this week from our
coast steamers has been larger than for several
weeks past. Laborers, although not plentiful
are fully sufficient to meet all our urgent de
mands, a The present strike has been more se
riously felt by diminishing the deliveries of do
mestic coals, still there .are more carts run
ning this week than for some time past. The
deliveries of. steam coals are made principally
by barges, hence are not materially affected by
the labor disturbances. A feeling 'of compro
mise, or early settlement, is becoming more aD
parent dally, and It is sincerely hoped that this
month will see the dissension entirely remedied
Coal freights from foreign sources are still
S l r . el 3 gt^ e ? lnS L hence Jitter . prices are being
obtained for those grades, although the demand
for same is light.. Oil is receiving coMMterabS
attention.- which has resulted in I' marked I lm!

that large contracts for future delivery canint

August opened Â¦ with a' commercial sky over
cast by 'storm cloud3 that threatened serious
injury to the steel industry, while drought in
the Southwest . aroused - pessimistic ' predictions
that business was on the, verge of a severe set
back. Â¦ Thousands of idle strikers, together with
a profitless season in agricultural regions, meant
inactivity in manufacturing, trade and trans
portation, according - to . (he prophets ; of evil.

almost clear and each "resumption ; of work at

Jobbers and manufacturers- report '.that- or

With a yield of 50.000,000 bushels in Manitoba
these shipments from. the Dominion are falline
little short of 1,000,000 weekly.
â¢ Somewhat lower quotations for wheat' are
not surprising,- in view of the genera! tendency
to increase estimates ] of 1 the crop far. beyond
the quantity Â¦ indicated by official figures of
condition.- Another weakening Influence is the
slight decline of exports below the rccord
fbreaklng movement in the first - two weeks of
August. Â¦ Shipments > for â¢ the week, however
were " still phenomenal, aggregating - 6,307.032
bushels, compared with 2,804,567 .last year and
3,307,917 in 1899. Moreover, this gain occurred
despite the i+nterruptton to shipments from the
Pacific Ocean by the strike of grain handlers
These figures of, exports omit the movement
from Canadian ports, : usually included in other
records, and. causing. confusion as to the actual
state of domestic trade. ' . ... â ,

New York Stock Market^
NEW YORK, Aug. 30â The stock market
made rather a striking demonstration of
ftrength *.o-day. The increasing disposition to
buy stooge as the day progressed indicated
that the demand to cover outstanding con
tracts came largely from the bear party. There
a-ae. however, also steady absorption of a
aumbcr of prominent stocks which was diffi
cult to explain on any other basis than as an
accumulation, for what purpose it was not
Jisclosed. The buying of this character was
particularly obvious In the Eries.- The buy
tng here was very concentrated and was by
srekers usually employed by the inside inter
ests of the property. A single commission
3ouse took between 10,000 and 15.000 shares of
;he common and considerable speculative feel-
Jig was attracted, some large buying of this
itock coming from Western sources. Union
Pacific. St. Paul and Atchison showed the be
*ted effect of the very large net earnings for
July reported earlier in the week and Canadian
Pacific and St. Louis and San Francisco con
.inued.to move upward from the same cause.
This was a general influence In holding the
* hoi" railroad list firm. Th'e transactions and
lie movements in general were not conspicuous
fhÂ« increase in the volume of business over
resterday was mostly confined to the stocks
*amed. There was considerable damage also
'.or Amalgamated Copper.X. The Gould South
ft-eeterns were well held to the accompaniment
>f vaguely defined rumors of coming develop
nents. The Â«Wabash issues rose about a point
tach and Denver and Rio Grande ' preferred
rained 2% upon intimations of a coming favor
ible annual report. Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦/â¢
The strength of the Chicago Terminal Trans
â¢er stocks was due to talk of absorption by the
Chicago and Alton. American Tobacco ad
'anced 3% jwitnout explanation and Colorado
fuel and Iron 2. - The New ' York, Chicago and
it. Louis stocks rose 2 to 2%. The bears were
teemingly discomfited by, the . absence of â¢ a
lurry in the * call loan , market. New York
tounted on the demands â¢ for. â¢ loans r to * carry
â¢ver until Tuesday to stiffen ra^es and bring
tocks upon the market. This failed to occur
London Market,
- NEW, YORK.; Aug. 3O.'-^-The", Commercial fAd
vertiser's ; London cablegramVsays:
The" 1 : stock Â¦ market 4 was : Inanimate *. to-day ' but
quotations * held -â¢ firm. t< Consols ; were I firm * on

In spite of a very unpromising forecast of the
week's cash "changes. . London bought stocks
quite freely here, and the resulting decline in
the exchange market added to the sentimental
effect of this buying. The market closed mod
erately active and firm. ,
The railroad bond market was very dull" but
firm. Total sales, J2.059.000.
United States bonds' were 1 all unchanged on
the last call. ' ' ' :..v -
The stock market of Monday suggested and
that of Tuesday confirmed the . inference t that
the elaborate efforts that had been making by
a contingent of professional operators for two
weeks to awaken a speculative movement in
stocks on the part of the outside public had
been ineffectual. The recognition of this fact
caused considerable throwing over of stocks to
realize by the professionals and the sharp
break In prices of Tuesday afternoon. The sub
sequent firmness of the market, in spite of the
anti-stagnation, indicated that the liquidation
had come from the weaker class of operators.
Better fortified holders seemed disinclined to
let go, and there were evidences of quiet ac
cumulation of various stocks. .The market
had, however. In ' the main reflected a waiting
attitude toward securities pending . the clear
ing away of various uncertainties overhang
ing the market, with the undertone of confi
dence in ultimate values of securities ob
viously undisturbed. The chief "deterrent â¢ fac
tor against speculative ventures is the future
requirements on the currency to move -. the
crops which are daily growing more defined.
An additional consideration was the decision
to close the Stock Exchange on Saturday pre
ceding the Monday holiday, which served to
check speculation, as a three-day interval of
trading always does. Opinion in Wall street
is that the steel strike has spent its force.
.But the technical market position of the United
States Steel â¢ stocks' is in some doubt. There
has been : a considerable outlay of results j to
support and protect the prices of these stocks
while they were under pressure. Up to : this
time any advance in -their prices has brought
out offerings indicating a disposition to market
the holdings thus acquired. Speculation in
the stock* has consequently been very light
here, i The effect upon the market is fear ,of a
possible drag from this source on any at
tempted general advance. The action of the
market on Tuesday, when the price of corn
turned strongly upward, again showed that
a renewal of unfavorable crop" reports might
still have power to depress the stock market.'
The deterioration of cotton is an influence in
the same category.
The reopening of the dispute between France
and Turkey is kept under observance. Only
slight disturbances have thus far been shown
In any of the securities markets.- But any
event threatening a recrudescence, of the East
ern question and its complicated conflict of na
tional interests in Europe is necessarily taken
account of In the financial world.
In the money market the large shipments of
currency to the interior have demonstrated that
New York would be subjected to the usual
demand for financing the crop movement at
a period rather earlier than last year. Mean
time, there is no indication of relaxation of
the unexpected requirements upon the money
market of the Treasury, operations by reason
of the surplus. . .
It is reported that after the coming visit of
the Czar to France, the Russian Government
will place a large loan in Paris. The Trans
vaal gold supply to the London money mar
ket is still cut off. Between September 1 and
November 1 the official year cash reserves of
New York banks were reduced more than forty
millions. There is not much ground for ex
pecting, therefore, that the New York money
market will not be subject to the usual pro
cess of loan contraction this fall to offset the
inro-ds upon reserves to meet interior de
mands and an escape from more stringency will
depend on the relief to be afforded by gold
imports and the readiness of foreign" money
markets to respond to demands for that pur
pose.
Railroad bonds have been dull, but firm.
United States 3s advanced % per cent over

surplus corn-growing States, but in the leading
Middle and Southern States as well. This in

yield as compared with, a year ago ; the price

pared with a year ago, the situation as to the
wheat I yield . and the probable - effect of the
crop out-turn upon the course of general trade
through the fall and winter". The general tenor
of the report as a whole -is quite favorable.
-*" On "the face of the returns, however, a yield
of not less than 1,400,000,000 bushels -: is indi

Aside; from' the strength- in textiles, the

mp.nded "warrants for the arrest of the

any pretense at investigation Justice
Henry Morris issued them. When Consta
ble George E. Clarke, called at the home :
of the Bormans at 1509 Morton street -this
morning with the warrants" for the < arrest
of the children he discovered their ex
treme youth and refused Â¦ to take . them
to the City Prison, although he did per
form the technical arrest that the law
required.
Justice Morris says he took . Bram

and did not thinly it necessary to inquire
into the matter before Issuing the war

After filling out thj warrants. Justice
Morris put them In the hands of Consta

Constable went to the Borman home,
when he made the astonishing discovery
that he had been detailed to arrest a pair
of infants. \iV> -;Â¦-Â¦,â¢Â¦ ''*'-;â¢''

Brammann does not make any explana
tion for his action, except that his prop
erty had been injured and he thought
that the arrest would be a good lesson.
"It will take five men five days to bring
order out of the wreck," said Contractor
Brammann this afternoon. "The plaster
was of the rough finish varietyâ the kind
that cannot be repaired by patching. It
will be necessary to tear out' all the plas
ter remaining in the walls, before the
work of repair can proceed. It will cost
me a good . round sum of. money before
I get through with it.
"I think it is all right to have these
children arrested. I have evidence that
they were the ones who did - it; They
have been annoying me long enough, and
I decided to teach them a lesson. I don't
know anything about their ages except
that: I was told they were 13 ; years old.
Somebody has got to settle for this."
The Bormans say Â« that any damage
oonp by their children will be fully paid
for, but they see no reason why two in
fants should be arrested. They are
anxious to do what is right and say that
the warrants should not have been" issued
against mere children. . .
An examination of the premises con
firmed the statement of Brammann that
the house had been injured. The chil
dren had swept their fingers across the
fresh plaster in every room of the house
There were three distinct divisions of
marks, showing the relative sizes of the

pay the penalty for refusing. I went
through the form of reading, the war
rants to them, all of which, of course,
had no meaning for them. Before I went
away I admonished ihem to keep out of
mischief and their mother told them I
was a policeman. Mrs. Borman promised
to call upon Justice. Morris and settle the
difficulty with him. The arrangement
v.'as satisfactory to me, and I came away
without bringing the culprits I expected
to put in the City Jail."
Mrs. Borman explained to the Con
stable that if her children were to suffer
arrest the children of the entire neigh
borhood should be arrested too, for they
were all concerned in the mischievous
attack on the plaster. She said she
would have chastised her children had
she known they were implicated in the
work of devastation. vr'i :-. .

been without it since. We have seven
children. Our baby, now eighteen months
old, would not take milk, so we tried Pos-
tum and found she liked It and it agreed
with her perfectly. She is to-day, and has
been, one of the healthiest babies In the
State. I use about two-thirds Postum' and
one-third milk and a teaspoon of sugar,
and put it into her bottle. If you could
have seen her eyes sparkle and hear her
Bay "good' to-day when I gave it to her,
you would believe me that she likes It.
"If I wae matron of an Infants' home,
every child would be raised on Postum!
Many of my friends say. 'You are looking
so well; I repiy, 'I am well; I drink Pos-
tum Food Coffee. I have no more trouble
with constipation, and know that I owe
my good health to God and Postum Food
Cottee.'
"1 am -writing this letter because I want
to tell you how much good the Postum
has done us, but if you knew, how I
â¢leJiHnk from, publicity, you would not pub-
fish this letterâ at least not over my
rame."â Milford. O.

Thomas. She will' get' all *of the $16,000
estate. Mrs;. Thomas is the widow, of the

an order distributing the estate to her
self. - She had previously, negotiated an
assignment to herself. of the interest of
Jennie 'Y/. Waltmann, who was adopted
by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas In 1874. Shortly
after the estate. was distributed a contest
was begun by . the brothers of the de
ceased, William W. and' D. S.: Thomas,
who alleged that> the adoption of Jennie
Waltmann was illegal and .that she \ had
no legal right to transfer her interest in
the e&tate. They also alleged , that. Mrs.
Thomas had not accounted for certain
moneys >. of the estate. It : was shown ;to

-By winning the women's singles tennis

As was expected, by far the best match
of the tournament was played In the semi
final round yesterday morning. The con
testants were the Mlsse3 May and Flor
ence Sutton. Although the former won
In straight sets the match -was exceed
ngly close, and in the first set It looked
as if Florence would be the winner. The
games see-sawed, first one gettinga -game
and ' then the other, until May .with, the
score 5-4 against her, took a. decided brace
and won the next three games . and set.
The score of the set was 7-5. In this set,
Florence ran her. sister from, one .' side > of
the court to the other and had her in dis
tress but the little champion proved too
strong and won out. The side line strokes
and head work of Florence were excel
lent. What she lacked was speed.
In the last set May Sutton's game im
proved - materially while Florence ap
peared a trifle - discouraged and was not
as steady as in the first set. After many
exciting rallies and a number of deuce
games the second set went to May, 6-0.
The complete score in her favor was 7-5,
6-3.' Both ladies played from the back
court throughout the match. .
The final match , was the attraction In
the afternoon and a good-sized crowd -was
on hand to witness the struggle for first
honors. ThÂ«f contestants were Ethel and
May That the latter would win without
much difficulty was a foregone conclu
sion The score in -May's favor was 6-2,
6â3 May realized that' she could hardly
lose and, took all kinds of chances,
smashing and volleying with a great deal
more speed than . she uses when hard
pressed. - Ethel changed her usual styJe
of play for the cut | game, and, although
she won many, points in this way at first,
her sister was not long in learning to
handle the cut strokes and won out more
easily than : she would have done had
Ethel played her regular game.

be \ on ; the basis of . this later T valuation
that the trustees > would figure if . they
presented a proposition for the purchase
of their site to the Carnegie library com
