lines of the Capitol itself, the President
will be greeted by several thousand school
children; who will' present him with flow

under consideration the great project of

addition there will be a large number of
handsomely decorated carriages and au
tomobiles in the parade.
St. James Park, the decoration of which
was assigned to the ladies of Santa Claxa
County, will also be magnificently deco
rated. These decorations will consist of
twelve-foot arches at each of the main en
trances, with four ten-foot arches in the
center leading to the fountain. The fount
ain will be handsomely decorated. The
great masterpiece of these decorations will
be the President's bouquet, which will be
erected near the First street side of the
park, directly opposite the entrance to the
courthouse.
The street decorations will consist of
evergreens, carnival flags, American flags,
palm trees, etc., so placed as to present
a beautiful appearance through all the
streets. The ' decoration of business
houses will also be made on a plan in
harmony with those of the streets, so
that when completed it will present, as a
whole, one of the most beautiful appear
ances that has ever been seen In San Jose.
For the past month the executive com

Â¦Work on the decoration and alteration
of the great nave of the ferry building
In preparation for the public reception
to the President on the night of nis ar
rival has been commenced, and before
the week is out it will be well under
Â¦way. It I? Intended that the President
Ffcall occupy a stand railed off from the
crowd and raised, the object being to
prevent any overenthusiastic citizen
from grabbing the Presidential hand and
vigorously shaking the same. It is the
edict that there shall be as little hand
shaking as possible, the idea being that
if the President shakes hands with every
enthusiastic XVepterner who desires the
honor he will leave his hand and a good
portion of his forearm, behind him. It
becomes work after several thousand
have done the pump-handle act, and the
prospect of several thousand more await
ing a chance does not help matters.
The stand from which the President
will receive in the ferry building will be
surrounded with ferns and palms and
flowers, and along the walls more green
and waving: branches will help to trans
form the place into a garden. And the
tri-colored lights which follow the arches
and girders will all be overhauled so that
they will burn their brightest, for it is
not often a President comes as far
toward the setting sun as San Francisco.
The crowds outside will be marshaled by
the military, and those on the inside by
the police. It is expected that there will
be at. least 103,000 people to pass through
the nave of the ferry building on that
eventful Tuesday night, and it will take
a great deal of planning, much patience
and more than ordinary skill to keep
the crowds from mixing themselves lu
the entrances and still have them re
main g-ood natured. The reception at
ths ferry building will be the only abso
lutely public appearance of the Presi
dent.
Street Decoration.
This morning will see the first move
toward decorating the streets. The deco
rations downtownâ that is below Third
and Kearny, on Market streetâ will con
sist mainly, of illumination, but along
Third and Kearny streets garlands and
potted palms will add their beauty to
the sun by day and the twinkling lights
by night. At the Intersection of Third.
Kearny, Geary and Market there will be
effected some such plan as so beautified
thÂ» crossing during* the presence of the
Native Sons at their last celebration.
And then up on Market street to the City
Hall more lights and evergreens will
transform the street Into a boulevard
fringed with green and roofed with blaz
ing lamps. At the bay the ferry build-
Ing will be outlined with fire, and far up
the street the gleam of the lamps will
end in the blazing tower of the City
Kail that will pierce the sky like a leap
ing flame.

WASHINGTON. April 2S.-Pas
senger engine 350. in charge
of Engineer Frank Lar
mond, will at 10:30 o'clock
Monday morning pull out
from the Pennsylvania sta
tion one of the finest private trains ever
run over any American railway system.
This train of seven cars Is for the use of
President McKinley and his party, and
on it they will travel* continuously for
nearly seven weeks, covering 10,581 miles
through the length and breadth of the
United States.
The guests have been notified to be at
the station promptly on time. Not a de
tail has been forgotten for the comfort
and convenience of the party. Each mem
ber was notified to havo his or her bag
gage^ ready at 8 o'clock Monday morning,
to be taken to the station, where It will
be placed In the individual staterooms
assigned to the guests, or In allotted
space In the combination baggage car.
Each person on the trip has received
from Secretary Cortelyou a card signed
by himself, proclaiming the bearer to be
a member of the President's party, and
commending the bearer to the courtesy
of any one to whom the card might be
presented.
All of the hundred details of the trip,
so admirably completed, have been ar
ranged by Secretary Cortelyou and by-
Second Vice President of the Southern
Railway V. P. Finley. through his
representative. Colonel I* S. Brown, gen
eral agent of the Southern Railway'Com
pany. The Southern Railway will have
charge of the trip from Washington to
New Orleans.
General Agent Brown will accompany
the party to superintend all details as
far as New Orleans. At this point the
party and the train will be under the
supervision of Julius Xruttschnltt, gen
eral manager of the Southern Pacific
Railroad.
The Train Beady.
At noon to-day the- train arrived In
WashinsrWiv_* ; rÂ«sh front th* .shops e*t tjJRjj
Pennsylvania. Company to "Wilmington,
Del.- The cars were sidetracked and will
be brought up to the station ready for
the start early to-morrow morning. By
the time the Presidential party has ar
rived the entire interior of the train will
be handsomely decorated by a local flor
ist. C*he entire train is practically new.
All of the cars have been touched up and
are glistening In their splendor. The
external color is the regulation rich dark
hue of the Pullmans.
Nothing will teU of the distinguished
occupants of the train except the Presi
dent's flag waving * from the tiny flag
rods at the front of the engine. The con
ductor of the train will be W. W, Al
bright. Both he and Engineer Laimond
are among the most trusted employes of
the Southern road. The engine is a first
class passenger engine, large and of the
latest type.
The President will not be relieved of
all his official duties while absent from
"Washington. In fact the seat of Govern
ment will go along with him. Three ste

public - business will be transacted as
thoroughly as if the executive were at
the 'VVhite House. All of the Cabinet of
ficers except Secretaries Gage and Root
and Attorney General Knoi will be mem

their daughters; but they expect to join
the party before San Francisco has been
reached.
Presidents Will Not Meet.
It Is now a certainty that President
Diaz will not meet President McKlnley
at El Paso, so the little session of the
Presidents of the sister republics has
been cut from the schedule. The reason
given is that Diaz cannot now leave the
City of Mexico on account of Important
affairs of state.
All the foreign Ambassadors have called
upon - Secretary Hay to bid him farewell
before he leaves on the President's trip.
Practically all of them have signified their
Intention to visit Europe during the Sec

SEATTLE, April 28.â Frank Oleson,
cashier of the defunct Scandinavian-
American Bank of Whatcom, Wash., was
arrested in this city to-day by Sheriff
Cudihee on a warrant charging him with
receiving deposits when he knew that the
bank was insolvent. J. S. Stangroom,
assistant cashier, was arrested in What
com last night. H. St. John Dix, the
president of the institution, is said to be
in London trying to raise funds to help
out the bank, but this has not prevented
Receiver Robert Muir from swearing out
a warrant for his arresj on a charge sim
ilar to that on which the cashier and as
sistant cashier have been taken into cus
tody.
Dix has proven himself a financier of
the Napoleonic order. He appeared in
Seattle two or three years ago as an ad
vertising solicitor. Going to Whatcom he
did some work of a booming order, and
then loomed upon the horizon as a full
fledged bank president. He represented
himself as the recipient of a good sum
of money from English sources.
That there was some basis for his claim,
even if it were exaggerated, seems to be
sustained by the discovery of some costly
oil paintings in New York City which he
owns, or did own once upon a time.
These paintings were supposed to be
worth In the neighborhood of $25,000. One
is a Murillo, and ought to bring $8000. The
trouble in this connection comes from a
report that the title is not clear.
If reports are true. Dix, by his astound
ing cleverness, succeedeu in borrowing all
the deposits of the bank and a good slice
of its capital. The sum is estim&ted in
round figures to be $25,000. The arrest of
Oleson and Stangroom is a great surprise.
Oleson has always stood very high in
Seattle, and people are inclined to believe
his statement that he has done nothing
criminal. Oleson says that he is' loth to
believe that Dix has done anything wrong.
Receiver Muir. however, has been in
charge of the bank long enough to look
well into the condition of affairs, and his
opinion is that there is plenty of work
for the courts In straightening out ;the
tangle. . â¢ Â¦

I Jupiter Pluvious is showering his

formed in the latter part of Saturday
brought welcome rain in its path, and
from the boundary line of Washington

The storm was reported to be sweeping

commenced this morning about 6 o'clock,
and there has been a continual downpour
ever since. Up to 5:30 o'clock this even
ing 1.41 inches of rain had fallen since
morning-. Much more water has fallen in
the northern part of the county than in
the southern portion. The country needed
rain badly, but this rain will assure a good
hay yield as well as a large crop of other
products. The general opinion through
out the county is that this rain has come
just at the right time.
Sonoma.
The rain has been badly needed for two
weeks. The wheat on both the islands

as the long dry spell had commenced to
wither the grass on the hillsides and the
grainfields were sadly in need of water.
Until this rain the farmers here were a
dejected lot. Now all is smiles, and the
county will save itself the humiliation
of having to acknowledge a dry year.

SACRAMENTO, April 28.â It has been
raining all day in Sacramento and the
surrounding country and great is the ju
bilation over the downpour. Weather Ob
server Barwick says that the rain for the
twenty-four hours ending at 10 o'clock to
night amounts to one-half inch, which
makes the month's record .82 of an inch.
This means 17.82 inches for the season, as
against 17.56 to an equal date last year.
Observer Barwick says that the rain has
been badly needed and that it will profit
orchardists and farmers many thousands
of dollars. He does not think it will in

in the case of the few earlier varieties of
cherries, fruit has not advanced far

In all respects the rain, which appears
of a general character, has done good. It
will be most beneficial to grain, in which
the upper Sacramento River section
abounds, and great crops are looked for.

the biggest catch of the day. At once he
decided to avenge himself by arousing the
envy of his companions, who had been
vaunting their superior prowess with rod

from that elevation catching the fish over

the fish Mr. Gallagher slipped and sat
down so violently as to almost dislodge
the rock. Bounding upward and outward,
he shot down to the water, twenty-five
feet below, striking- with a tremendous
splash.
The fisherman was somewhat stunned by
his contact with the water and, had not
the rest of the party been near, it would
have fared ill with him. They hastened to
his assistance and aided him to emerge
from the pool, spouting water like an ele

ascent being difficult because of the
weight of his water-soaked apparel. After
a warming-up draught or two "Billy" was

with him to San Francisco, to be placed

OMAHA, April 28.â James Callahan was
declared not guilty to-day of complicity in
the kidnaping of Edward Cudahy Jr.. the
verdict being reached shortly after 9
o'clock this morning. The Judge had evi
dently been expecting another verdict and
was openly disappointed.
"It Is impossible for me to understand,
he said, "how twelve intelligent men could
have agreed upon such a verdict after
listening to the testimony. The defendant
could not have chosen more wisely if he
had been selecting his own representatives
and the community could not have made
a more unsatisfactory selection. This jury
is discharged without the compliments of
the court."
Callahan's attorneys were not present,
and the defendant expressed a desire to
thank the jurors in his own behalf. This
the court refused to permit. He said the
jury did not deserve any thanks.
Two other counts still hang against Cal

another to convict him. The reward of

As far as could be ascertained there was
at no time serious difference in the opin
ions as to Callahan's innocence among the
jury. Three were inclined to favor a ver

their colleagues that a reasonable doubt
existed.
General Cowin, leading the prosecution,
says that Callahan probably will be re
leased in the morning. The other charges
against himâ grand larceny and false im
prisonmentâare virtually synonymous.
The State would be obliged to depend up
on the same evidence as that which ha3
already been brought out and there is

could be tried again on a charge so close

and ground Into splinters by an immense
mass of snow and Ice. Many more lives
would have been lost had it not been for
the fact that just previous to the slide the
people were aroused by several shocks of
earthquake, which were so severe that
many of the occupants of the destroyed
houses were prepared. When they heard
the roaring and rumbling of the avalanche
as it came crashing down the mountain
they fled for their lives and many reached
places of safety. Those who escaped the
avalanche are practically destitute, hav
ing no food, clothing or shelter.
The ruined portion of Sunrise Cltr 1*
situated on a fiat at the base of the
mountain, but In a place where no. fears
of a slide were entertained. The unusu
ally heavy snowfall and the earthquako
shock is thought to have been responsible
for the disaster. x
News of the disaster reached Valdes by
a mall carrier wha left Sunrise City short
ly after the occurrence and reached Val
des just before the mail steamer sailed
from that place for Juneau. The names of
the victims had not been learned. Rescu
ing parties from the main portion of the
town Â¦were at work Â¦when the mall carrier
!ef c, but were making little or no progress,
as the ground on which the buildings
stood Â¦whs covered with from twenty to
sixty feet of snow. Ice, rocks and timbers
which came down with the slide. It will
be some days before the exact number
and names of the dead can be ascertained,
as the occupants of the houses were con
stantly going to or coming from some re
ported strike.

In submitting Its recommendations for a
naval increase to Secretary Long next fall
there is reason to believe the General
Board will point out the necessity" of ob
taining authority from Congress for thÂ«
construction of a sufficient number of
ships to enable the United States to prop
erly uphold the Monroe doctrine.
In failing to authorize the Immediate
construction of two battleships and two
armored cruisers. Admiral Dewey be
lieves, the officer who discussed the mat
ter said, that Congress has made a great
mistake. The designs for these ships are
being prepared by the Board of Construc
tion, and, as it will then regard four ships
as sufficient, the navy will suffer a distinct
loss in construction, besides experiencing
a delay in securing the addition of more
armorclads to its material.
To counteract the preponderating force
Germany would possess in that time the
General Board believes that it would be
highly advisable for the United States to
adopt a programme which would give this
country a sufficiently large fleet to cope
with that of a continental European
power.
Germany has been expediting the con
struction of her fleet, and. as recently
stated in The Call, the authorities here
understood that it would be completed
within five years.
CALL BUREAU, 1405 G STREET, N.
W. f WASHINGTON, April 28.â There Is a
strong feeling of apprehension in high
naval circles that the prediction of the
Saturday Review of London yesterday, that
the struggle for the preservation of the
Monroe doctrine would be precipitated by
Germany, will be realized as soon as the
German naval programme has been com
pleted.
A high naval officer, who is acquainted
with the' views of Admiral Dewey and
other members of the General Board, re
called to-day the prediction made by the
admiral while at Trieste, that America's
next war would be with Germany, and
it would not be of her seeking. The ad
miral and those who have closely studied
the policy of the German Emperor are
confident that unless there is some radical
change in the attitude of that European
sovereign, either the United States must
abandon the Monroe doctrine or must take
measures for preserving it.
The navy does not want war with Ger
many and it believes it can be averted.
The way to avoid trouble, the officer who
discussed the matter today, said, was to
make such preparations that Germany
would be deterred from assuming a hos
tile attitude.
It has been evident for some time that

INDIANAPOLIS, Apil 28.â The fifteenth
annual convention of the Theosophlcal So

WASHINGTON, April 28.â The quarter
master's department of the army has di
rected Major Hyde, quartermaster at
Nagasaki, to make every effort to prd
cure better coal for the transports which
coal at that place. The necessity of coal
ing at Nagasaki became apparent as soon
as- the United States took control at Ma
nila. It is true that coaling could be done
from collier, in Manila Bay, but for only
six months In the year. For the remain
der of the time it is impossible to get a
ship and collier together with safety. Ar
rangements are made now to coal In San
Francisco and Nagasaki and no oftener
in Manila than necessary. Major Kyde
has been instructed to ascertain which is
the best coal to be found in Japan and to
contract for a continuous supply for the
transports. The Japanese coal is not the
best, but it Is found to be the most econ
omical that can be used. It costs about
$4 per ton, while Australian coal taken to
Nagasaki and resold costs about $12 per
ton owing to the high duty placed upon
coal bv Japan in the interest of her own
coal fields. The great drawback to the
Japanese coal is the fact that it contains
too much sulphur and instead of the com
bustion occurring in the furnace it often
goes into the pipes and is very destructive
to that portion of the boilers. Much of
the repairing that has been found neces
sary to the army transports has been
about the -boilers which have been dam
aged by Japanese coal. At the same time,
owing to the great cost of coal brought
from Australia, it is found economical to
use Japanese coal rather than pay the
higher price for Australian coal. The
navy does not usÂ© Japanese coal. At San
Francisco the Quartermaster's depart
ment pays the highest price for. coal.
Most of it reaches San Francisco as bal
last, but some comes from North Pacific
ports. The department is now experi
menting with coal from, Utah and it is
believed that If can be shipped to San
Francisco end sold lower than other coals
which are now purchased there.

BERLIN, April 28.â The money market

It was Rev. Dr. Wayland Spauldine,
president of the Congregational Clerical
Union, who, on Monday last, called Mark
Twain low born and ill bred.
"Mrs. Clemens was too tired to come,
and I'm glad she was. I don't want her
to hear things like that. Why don't you
people, so far as your calling will al
low, try to tell the truth? To be sure,
you sometimes get out of practice, but
one saying one thing and one another
you produce confusion in the minds of
people about religious matters.
"Rev. Dr. Â» oh, I won't mention his
name, has just called me low born and
ill bred. I don't mind that so much.
Shakespeare was low born, too; and there
was Adamâ I believe he was born out
In the woods. But I'm glad the doctor
didn't say it about Adam. When such
a thing is said about the head of the
family it hurts. Anyhow, I think I would
prefer to be low born â in a republic â
like the rest. If I had been born on the
other side, why, then I would have liked
to be born a' Duke, as I suppose
Rev. Dr.â I won't mention his name
would have been, if he had been born
there."
When Mark Twain's time came he said:
"At Just this time I am. remarkably com
forted by an invitation to meet a body
of clergymen like this. It is only in
Brooklyn- that I am appreciated. Bu{/
what's the use of lugging that in about

In January of this year Cailles offered a

General Cailles recently offered a re

Edward N. Jones Jr. of the Eighth Infan
try. For more than a year past Caillea
has commanded the insurgent forces op
erating to the east of Bay Lake, not far
from Manila. He Is said to be a French,
half-caste. He has a reputation for vln
dictiveness and cruelty, and is one of the
two or three Filipino leaders still in the
field who have clearly ignored the ob
servances of honorable warfare. The So

was to assassinate and bury alive those
of their countrymen who accepted Amer

into their hands, operated with the cogni

Cailles. If Cailles were captured it is

Taken altogether, these various misrepresentations
and mistakes are of a nature to shake popular faith in
Ihe accuracy of monumental inscriptions. It may be
all right to trust to those which were erected by the
ancient Egyptians and by the ancient Assyrians, but
imything later is subject to dispute. We have long
heard in this country of monumental errors, but not
until this time did the exact meaning of the phrase
come home to us. Y- â¢
Another case of amending an inscription has been
brought to light in the city cemetery at Norfolk, Va.
There stands there a handsome marble monument
bearing the inscription, "Sacred to the memory of
Mrs. Margaret - â , who died â "; and beneath is
added, "Erratum: For Margaret, read Martha." â¢
;It appears that another error just about as serious
but. on a local. matter was discovered in a memorial
tablet commemorating the founder of the city- of
Springfield, Mass. â¢ In that case/ however, the citizens
protested, and we lean that . the ; error -was "rectified
by an amendment" to the inscription.
It is explained that the patriots whom the tablet
was designed to commemorate are those of the Revo
lution, but as the war for. independence did not begin
until 1775 the record places their, death about twenty
years too early. Evidently the Daughters of the
Revolution have tried to . make their lineage a little
I'it longer than it really ought to be, and the result
is going to be confusion in the minds of the young
patriots who try to make the school histories tally
with the records of th.; civic monuments.

The most notable error of the kind has been dis
covered in the inscription upon a memorial recently
set up in New York City. It runs thus:
OWING to the widespread discussion over the
action of the sculptor in placing upon the
pedestal of the Logan monument at Washing
ton a tablet misrepresenting the facts of history there

In the meantime it is to be noted that the boom,
for Tom L. Johnson, which started immediately upon
hi/ election as Mayor of Cleveland, has not. subsided.
Henry Watterson has taken it up. In a recent issue of
the Louisville Courier-Journal he said: "If Tom John',
son is elected Governor of Ohio next fall, and if two
Signs of the work of the Hill hoomers are visible
in all sections of the Union. His friends are to be
seen throughout the Southern States and on. thii
coast. It is in New York, however, that the work is
most conspicuous. The recent -organization of. "The
Greater New York Democracy" on a platform declar
ing opposition to Tammany Hall, is clearly a move
ment in the interests of Hill's Presidential aspirations;
and seems designed not so much for use in New York
as for the purpose of impressing the country, with
the idea that Hill is now a reformer, against the bosses
and for the people.
Within the higher circles of the party David Ben
nett Hill has an eas/ leadership. The Washington
correspondent of the New York Times quotes a prom
inent Democrat of Maryland as saying that while his
personal preference is for Gorman, he believes that
statesman to be too timid for leadership at this time,
and that therefore Hill has the advantage. â¢ By way
of explaining the situation the Maryland man went
en to say: "We are not rich in leaders, in men of
statesmanship; but we need some men of common
sense and courage more than we do brilliant states
men. Until these men come to the surface and as
sume that leadership which must be followed by suc
cess, we shall go on trimming in Congress and grovel
ing at our conventions under the malign influence of
the Christian Scientists of politics. If there is one
quality the possession of which will give to its pos
sessor the chance to revive the drooping spirits of the
Democratic^ party, that quality is courage, and the
man who now seems to have a conspicuous'* share. of
it is your former Senator, Mr. Hill, if another, with
more courage and a clearer perception of the needs
and opportunities of his party arises before the ne"xt
national convention, I am convinced that the Demo
cratic party will hail h:m as a veritable political
Moses."
Whatever view the country may take of Bryan's
renunciation, the Democratic leaders have evidently
taken him at his word and his words at face value.
It is a long time before the next Presidential election,
but already the wirepullers of Democracy have begun
to lay their wires, the loomers have set about arrang
ing for their booms and the hornblowers have made
ready their horns. â¢ *
BRYAN has taken from his feet the shoes of
Presidential aspiration and cast them aside.
Such at any rale is his statement.' In a recent
number of the, Commoner he has said: "I am not
planning for another Presidential nominationâ if I
were I would not be editing a paper." Under ordin
ary circumstances such a statement would not amount
to much. It has long been the custom of candidates
for the Presidency to lake off the shoes of candidacy
in off years, but it has been noted they put them on
again when an election year came round. There are
reasons, however, for believing Bryan to be sincere.
In the first place he has had enough in the way of
Democratic nominations and in the second place
Democracy has had enough of him* In his case,
therefore, it is likely the shoes have been cast aside
for good.
BRYAN'S OLD SHOES.
: Mr. Cramp has been twice married, and
has five living children. Following the ex
ample of his father he has drawn his sons
into active identification with the ship
building Industry. Henry W. Cramp la
vice president and treasurer of the com
pany. Edwin S. Cramp is the superintend
ing engineer.
Mr. Cramp Is intensely charitable In
his inclinations and the immediate sec
tion of the city In which the Cramps"
shipyards are situated offers a fruitful
field for private and unostentatious acts
of benevolence. Many are the stories told
of his generosity among the poor of Ken
sington. But one doubts whether. If asked
about any one of these cases of helpful
ness, the donor would be willing to ad
mit the act, so quietly does he go about
his works of charity.
Mr. Cramp is greatly honored in the
commercial and industrial world of his
native city, where no representative gath
ering Is deemed complete without his
presence, and his advice and counsel on
public matters are highly esteemed.
His life has been singularly free from
ostentation or the desire to occupy a large
place in the public eye, but he has, never
theless, made the impress of his force and
genius felt in the broad progress that the
country has made from an isolated nation
to a commanding position In the naval and
maritime history of the half century Just
past.
His Sons Share His Burdens.
Passing to the more directly personal
side of Mr. Cramp's life the same qual
ities of simple, direct, forcefulness are
found to exist. He Is known to nearly ev
ery one of the thousands of employes of
the big yards, and there is not a man,
from switch tender to consulting engi
neer, who cannot approach him. For years
the immediate discipline of the works has
been committed to other hands, but there
is little of the life, individual or opera
tive, that goes on without his knowledge.
In all the affairs between the company
and' the men Mr. Cramp takes a strong
Interest, and while firm in his stand when
once assumed, he is kindness itself when
it comes to a. study of individual cases.
It may be a surprise to know that the
builder of million-dollar ships for this and
other nations is not many times a mil
lionaire himself, but the truth Is that Mr.
Cramp is not a very rich man. The ener
gies and Interests of his life have been al
most wholly absorbed in this shipbuilding
plant that bears his father's name. He
has not given time to the accumulation
of wealth for his own use. He Is not
known as a patron of art, nor does he live
in an extravagant fashion. He is a
straight-forward, simple-mannered gentle
man, who has given all the years of his
life to the arduous task of building up the
Industry that was in its infancy when he
first opened his eyes upon the little world
of Kensington.
Closely Davoted to His Business,
tury of active Identification with it and
a mind of naturally predisposed by inher
itance and early training alone could give,
but It has been by intense and constant
personal effort that he has mastered the
modern problems of naval construction,
and this has enabled him to turn out from
his shipyards such splendid specimens of
naval vessels as the New York, the Bal
timore, the Indiana, the Massachusetts,
the Brooklyn and the Iowa of the new
American navy, the Retvizan and Varlag
for the .Russian navy and the Kasagt for
tho Japanese navy. The transition from
wood to Iron shipbuilding was made when
the present head of the Cramp yards was
a young man. That he caught some fore
shadowing of the future of iron and steel
shipbuilding goes without saying, and
through the years that have elapsed since
the death of his father and the active
management of the enterprise fell upon
his shoulders he has been slowly and me
thodically working out the plans which
lay in his mind as a result of his earlier
study and anDllcatlon.
From v the high school young Cramp
passed Immediately into the active career
of a shipbuilder. Although his father
owned and was operating a shipbuilding
plant it was thought best -to give his son
his first taste of service beyond the par
ental roof, so he went' into the shipyards
of his maternal uncle, John BIrely, who
conducted a small shipbuilding plant on
the Delaware River front in the Kensing
ton borough. From his uncle's young
Cramp was graduated into the mold loft
of his father's shipbuilding plant and from
the da*y he assumed those responsible du
ties until the present he has moved stead
ily forward in the career that places him
at the head of -the world's shipbuilders
and has made him practically the princi
pal builder of what is. to-day called "the
new American navy." >
While Mr. Cramp inherits much of his
taste and inclination for ship construc
tion, and, like his father, the original head
of the enterprise, is possessed of remark
able inventive genius and a mind whose
natural bent is toward applied mathemat
ics, he has also a distinctive personality
that explains '.n. no small degree his suc
cess and the present magnitude and scope
of tho great company of which he is the
president. < \
It is within "1 he immediate confines of
the big shipbuilding yards in Kensington,
a part of the city of Philadelphia, that the
Beginning "Work as a Shipbuilder.
Young Charles H. Cramp as a boy was
sent to the old Central High School of
Philadelphia, where, under the tutelage of
the . famous Alexander Dallas Bache, he
received a thorough training in mathe
matics, a study for which the young pupil
showed a peculiar aptness. As Illustrative
of this it may be noted that of the four
pupils of the Philadelphia Central High
School .- selected , by Professor Bache to
make nightly observations from the Gi
rard College observatory' Charles H.
Cramp was one. Reports of these observ
ations were sent to .Washington and the
system then Inaugurated formed the basis
of what Is now the nation's signal service
bureau. :Â¦Â¦
Mr. Cramp Inherits the genius that has
brought him such great success. He is
the eldest son of a shipbuilder, his father,
William Cramp, having established a
shipyard on nearly the same stto now oc
cupied .by the immense plant of which it
was the nucleus, so long ago as 1S30. That
was two years after the birth of his son
Charles, which occurred In the Kensing
ton Borough of Philadelphia on May 9,
1S2S. William Cramp was a notable fig
uie in the early development of Industrial
Philadelphia. His was a strong, rugged
character, possessed of virtues that made
him beloved by his fellow-cltlzens. . His
indomitable perseverance was shown in
the fact that amid conditions unfavorable
to the development of his enterprise he
overcame all obstacles. At the time of
his death In 1879 he had the marvelous
record of having built 207 vessels for the
high seas and had brought the once small
shipbuilding plant of his early efforts to
a world-wide repute.
claimed: "The Industry and genius that
hrve made this splendid fighting ship pos
sible deserve the highest praise of a na
tion."
That genius and Industry Is possibly
best embodied In the person of the head of
the great American shipbuilding firm
from whose yards on the Delaware River
the New , York was launched, Charles
Henry Cramp; for. notwithstanding the
able associates In the persons of his own
sons and members of the Cramp family
connected with him In the direction and
control of the great works. It Is to him
that the credit Is due for the past achieve
ments of the firm and for the proud place
It now holds In the shipbuilding Industry.
In that group of American citizens
whose names are indlssolubly connected
with the vaBt commercial and Industrial
achievements of the past half century the
name of Charles Henry Cramp, head of
the great William Cramps' Sons Ship and
Engine Building Company, Is familiar
throughout the world. Yet It belongs to
a quiet, modest gentleman, who Is as
thoroughly Identified with the work and
advancement of the humblest riveter In
his big shipyard as he is with the great
rational movements of recent years that
have practically made him the "maker of
rinvles."

The local situation is now purely dependent upon
the weather. The long dry spell, broken by
the rains of yesterday, extending over the major
part of April, and which has been exceeded but
twice in fifty-two years, according to the records, and
father severe frosts during the past week, have al
tered crop prospects materially. In most sections;
however, a good crop of grain is still possible without
any more rain, though the yield will hardly be as large
as previously anticipated; but it is undeniable that the
continued heavy frosts "have made serious inroads
upon the fruit crop. The merchants, however, con
tinue to report the best trade for a number of years,
rnd there are no complaints from any quarter. With
fair showers from now on we ought to pull out all
right.
As for the humdrum side of business â the daily
trading in produce and merchandise â there is little
new to note. Floods in many sections have inter
rupted the distribution of merchandise and interfered
with retail trade. The staples show little life as a
rule. Wool is barely steady, hides and leather are
quiet and not materially changed, and business in
boots and shoes is smaller. Lumber is reported firm,
while orders for iron and steel continue to engage the
full capacity of the works everywhere, though they
are not as crowded with business as in 1899. The
feature of the week, outside of Wall street, was the
advance in wheat, mainly due to bad reports from the
German crop, assisted by less favorable reports from
California, where rain has been seriously needed.
Wall street has been boiling for some little time,
but indications of a reaction are appearing. The situ
ation is simple. The vast financial interests which
have formed the enormous trusts are not ready yet
to let their shares deciine, and arc straining every
nerve to keep 'hem up, while the small and cautious
interests, as well as the public at large, are becoming
afraid of the high valuations and arc getting out. They
are selling â which, in the jargon of the street, is called
liquidation and realizing. The great moneyed inter
tits are taking the stocks thus thrown on the market
and actually bidding for more. This is called "sus
taining the market." How long this will last is a
conundrum which is interesting the bankers and finan
ciers of New York. What will happen when the pub
lic has liquidated is another conundrum. At present
conditions are assuring. Money is not stringent and
the powers behind the trusts seem to have plenty of
it to operate with. Besides, the national treasury is
almost gorged with gold. Furthermore, the Euro
pean nations are coming over here as borrowers, and
the United States has practically superseded England
as the creditor nation. of the world, for England is
now borrowing from us. Every day brings nearer the.
lime when New York, rnd not London, will be the
financial center of the world. Nor is that time very
distant.
Still, with all this ready money, it is a question how
long Wall street will continue to boil.
TRADE conditions became irregular again last
week. The steady tone was no longer visible.
Some lines kept up, while others fell off. The
country's bank clearings showed an apparent gain in
the volume of business over the corresponding week
last year of 69.5 per cent, but when the figures are
examined it will be .reen that this gain was largely
confined to New York. Thus, the aggregate clear
ing? of the United States were $2,934,897,000, and of
this amount New York furnished $2,201,516,000, with
an increase there of 103 per cent. No other city of
importance showed any such gain, the next highest
being 34.8 per cent at San Francisco, while the gains
at Boston and Chicago fell off. to 79 and 5.2 respect
ively. Pittsburg, the center of the steel industry, fell
off to 25.8 per cent. So this increase of 69.5 per cent
in the business of the country last week simmers down
to much smaller proportions when looked at closely,
and it is seen that the apparent improvement in trade
is largely confined to t'ie New York Stock Exchange
and represents active speculation in railroad and in
div-;rial shares.
TRADE AGAIN IRREGULAR.
There may not be many nien in Alabama who will
actively engage in opposing the scheme of the Demo
cratic leaders, but the slightness of the vote in favor
of the constitutional convention is a proof that the
great mass of the people are indifferent to it. Conse
quently they are in a mocd to be affected by the argu
ments of such earnest men as make the fight. The
situation has therefore its gleams of brightness. The
scheme is not to be carried out in silence. The better
elements of the people of Alabama are to at least,con
front the wrong with argument and with protest.
As a further and perh&ps more effective argument
against the plan, the opponents of it remind conser
vative and progressive men that any suppression of
political privileges will hc.ve a tendency to render the
negroes restless and dissatisfied. On that point
Murphy says: "Will such conditions help anybody's
business? Our negroes are not an ideal population,
but they are suited to the' industrial needs of the
South. Most of them sre going quietly about their
work. A policy of alarm will not be a policy of profit.
It will not increase the value of the negro to Alabama.
Anxiety, restlessness and discontent bring the paraly
sis of efficient labor. Political agitation is economic
foolishness. Contented, steady, continuous work is
the most productive work in the world. The farmer
and planter know that they can. get more corn and
more cotton out of a contented labor than out of the
labor that is frightened by the beating of the political
tom-tom, and disturbed and unsettled by the crude
animosities of the political hustings. It is all un
necessary."
Mr. Murphy .then proceeds to point out that while
illiteracy is not a crime, literacy is a duty; that it' is
incumbent upon the State to educate its people; that
if all illiterates, white and black alike, were excluded
from voting the act would stimulate them to learn^to
read and to write; that to exclude only illiterate ne
groes, leaving the ignorant and idle whites in full
possession of the ballot, would be a surrender of one
of the best means to promote education and would
put political power into the hands of willfully ignorant
and lazy vote sellers.
One of the opponents of the plan, E. G. Murphy of
Montgomery, has issued a public letter warning the
people of the dangers likely to result from it. He.dis
misses the argument that it, is necessary to disfran
chise the negro in order to secure white supremacy
with the simple statement that white supremacy in
Alabama is already universal; there is not an elective
office held by a negro anywhere in Alabama and negro
domination could not be accomplished in the State
except by military force, which will never be at
tempted.
DESPITE the advice of Senator Morgan that
the Democrats of Alabama carry out their
scheme for disfranchising the negroes as quiet
ly as possible, so as not to give rise to discussion in
?he North, it appears they movement will not be effect
ed without !ebate and p'.fctest even in Alabama itself.
Thtre are Democrats in the State who deem the pro
posed policy to~be prejudicial to the interests of the
commonwealth and they have not hesitated to say so.
A VOICE FROM ALABAMA:
It is not to be doubted that "Cousin Tom Johnson"
will be a pretty good war cry in Dixie, and perhaps
the "cropheads,". as Watterson calls theni, may yet
have to accept it. In the meantime the Hill boomers
have taken due notice of the Wattersonian "ifs"and
are going right along as if there were no Cousin Tom
in the country.
It will be noted there are a good many "ifs'Vin Mr.
Watterson's prediction, but they do not disturb the
flow of his eloquence; so he. goes on to pour forth the
rapture: "Let the boys in the trenches pray that it
may be sq;'that this chip of a sound old Kentucky'
block, born in Dixie, blessed by Indiana and blazed
forth a leader in Ohioâ this 'Cousin Tom Johnson
of Ours,' who went hence a barefoot to 'come back
v.ith a pocketful of buckeyes and something to spare
besides, may sweep the State of Ohio as he has swept
the city of Cleveland; that he may fight and win the
ante-Presidential battle of 1903, and that, repeating
the story of Tilden ani Cleveland before him, he may
finally come to his kingship at the head of a mighty
host of Democrats unlerrified and undefiled, not cast
ing one look of longing nor regret behind."
years later," having made a good Governor, he holds
down his job, all will be over for 1904 but the shout
ing. Put that in your cob pipe and smoke it, you
cropheads."
Starting from the capital to-day, it will not be long
before the President is with us. From now until the
day on which he is due in San Francisco time will
fly fast. Every citizen should therefore determine at
once upon the extent z.nd nature of the decorations
with which he will make his premises vie with those
of his neighbors in beauty and brightness.. There
have been many notable decorative effects produced in
San Francisco on great occasions in times past, but
now let us break all records.
It is gratifying to know that all these preparations
have been made, but in the midst of them we should
nor forget that the President's life work has been
the study and the practice of that kind of politics that
promotes prosperity. He delights in learning of the
working life of a people, of their industries and their
interests. He should therefore be afforded as many
opportunities as possible of becoming acquainted with
the resources of the State and the matters in which
tiic welfare of the commonwealth can be promoted by
rational legislation.
The time which the Presidential party will spend in
California will constitute the climax of the tour. The
receptions given from the day he enters the State until
he leaves it will form the most memorable features
of his journey. From preparations that have been
made at all points where he is expected to stop, even
for a few minutes, it is evident that California as seen
from the Presidential train will appear as a land gar
landed with flowers from one end to another, and
occupied by a people to whom hospitality is at once
a virtue and a joy, a duty and a love.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY will to-day leave
Washington upon the tour that is to bring him
to California., It is to be the" longest Presi
dential tour in our history, for while other Presidents
have come to California none have made the long:
sweep around the whole Union that McKinley will
have made when he gets back to Washington; In
other respects, also, it will surpass the former tours
of Presidents, for never before have such extensive
preparations been made for the reception of a Presi
dent over so long and so varied a route.
In his great speech opposing the policy of the ad
ministration toward the Philippines Senator Hoar
paid a high tribute to the personal worth of President
McKinley and said of him: "He is more loved than
juiy President we have had since Lincoln." The
phrase comes as near as any single phrase can to
expressing the hold the President has upon the peo
ple. He has a place in the hearts of all. His deep
regard for the personal welfare of every American,
manifested during his whole political life and uttered
.-.gain and again in his speeches, has had its natural
effect upon the masses, and he is looked upon as' a
personal friend by all whose industries he has helped
to make prosperous. His coming, therefore, im
presses the public mind as something more than a
mere official tour. He willfbe greeted by people not
solely from a fondness for grand parades, nor yet from
a lcj'al desire to show their respect for his high office;
but because of a personal admiration and esteem, and,
as Senator Hoar said, love for himself.
He comes 'to us with his Cabinet on what is called
?. holiday tour. It is to be no idle holiday. From the
tmic he leaves Washington until he completes his
journey there will be for him the most fatiguing kind
of work, that of attending official receptions, public
handshakings, fetes and functions of all kinds. .It
devolves upon the citizens to be considerate and not
to impose too much of that kind of work upon him.
It is to be borne in mind his Cabinet will be with him
and governmental business will have to be performed
e\ery day. Such considerations should prompt the
people to receive the President with that hospitality
which does not impose too much upon the guest.

Be Brought From Los. .
Angeles.
Captain Seymour received a dispatch
Saturday from Chief Elton of Los Ange
les that the last named had been unable
to hold Julia Gonzaleski and Francisco
Gordelli on the charge, of grand larceny
for stealing jewelry from the residence of
Atcrltz Meyberg there, as nÂ» trace of the
stclen jewelry had been found.- Elton sug
gipted that the prisoners should- be
brought here for trial. . ?
Detectives McMahon and Reynolds were
instructed by Captain Seymour yesterday
morning to go to Los Angeles; and bring
the two prisoners here and they left bv
yesterday afternoon's train. '
The woman was employed for a few
days as a nurse- by Mrs. Catherine Kspl
no7a, 2400 .Harrison street, and on March
21. while the family was temporarily ab
sent, she and Gordelll, her accomplice,
gathered together all the Jewelry hi the
house, valued at several thousand dol
lars, and $450 in coin and tied. They were
traced to the Lombard! Hotel on Broad
way by the Â¦detectives, but the officers
were too late, as the thieves had disap
peared, leaving an empty trunk behind
them.
Nothing 1 was heard of the woman and
her confederate till Aprih'14, when Cap
tain Seymour w^s notified that a man and
a woman answering the description of the
pair had been arrc-sted in L,os Angeles for
stealing jewelry from the Meyberg resi
dence. The woman gave her name as
Julia Card and the man. said his was
Alfred Gatia. When the man was
searched a quantity of Jewelry was found
In his possession and Chief Elton sent on
a detailed list of this and photographs of
the two prisoners, airs. Espinoza identi
fied the photographs as those of Julia
Gonzaleski and Francisco Gordelli and
also the jewelry as the' property stolen
from her residence. She at once swore
to warrants for the arrest of the pair on
the charge of grand larceny and Detec

warrants.
It is believed that the woman and the
man have been' operating in other cities
in the same way. The woman, who is 23
years of age and prepossessing in appear
ance, secures a situation In a house and

Lumber Lost in the Flames.

Kedding to take charge of his father's
body.
Charles Bairuther paid his family a
short visit two weeks ago, and just before
his return to his ranch he had a peculiar
premonition of his death. The last night
he spent in San Franciscoâ Tuesday
night, April- 16â he awoke with the ex
clamation to his wife, "some one has shot
me!" He had dreamed that he was shot,
and so strong an Impression did 'the
dream make that he was unable to sleep
during the remainder of the night. How
ever, he returned to the ranch In a cheer
ful mood and in excellent health.

The Columbia Theater will reopen next
Monday night with a very strong attrac
tion in James A. Hearn's production of his
new play, "Sag Harbor." From all ac
counts the author has turned out as
clever and attractive a play as his former
success, "Shore Acres," and the company
appearing In the p^ay is said to be one
of exceptional strength.

"The Conquerors," at the Alcazar, is
still playing to standing room only nnd
will be the bill this week and possibly
next at the popular little theater. It is
unquestionably the strongest bit of "work
the Alcazar company has put up since â
possibly since "The First Born": not that
it in the least resembles that tragedy of
the Orient but the play has the same
grip and sheer truth of inspiration, and
the company has grasped the situation.
It is to be repeated that it Is not meet
for the matinee girl. Â¦

CHARLES BAIRUTHER ACCIDENTALLY
SHOT AFTER PREMONITION OF DEATH
IN spite of the welcome deluge last
night the first performance of the
Neill engagement at the California
Theater comfortably filled the house
with an audience highly appreciative
of the good things in the first Neill offer
ing, "A Bachelor's Romance."
The Neill season last year was evidently
well remembered by the audience and as
evidently pleasantly remembered. Each
member of the company was given hearty
j greetingâ James Neill himself, Miss
; Edythe Chapman, who is as pleasing as
ever; Julia Dean, whose work has
strengthened; Lillian Andrews, Frank
McVicars, and new members who have
joined the forces. Neill' gave the same
good portrait, quiet, finished, convincing,
of the bachelor whose romance forms the
subject of the play, as he did last year.
Beggs, his crusty secretary, Is played for
all Its dry, droll worth by John W. Bur
ton. Frank McVicars has a congenial op
portunity in the part of Mulberry, and
Frank E. Camp does good work aa the
black sheep brother of the bachelor, Ger
ald Holmes. Donald Bowles shows prom
ise in the small role of Savage, and Scott
Seaton does well what little he has to do
as Harold Reynolds.
The ingenue role of Sylvia is Miss
Dean's part, and Mies Dean has much Im
proved since last year. She Is a dainty
Sylvia, girlish, tender and frank, as the
playwright planned her. Edythe Chap
man of the charming voice is cast as
Helen le Grand, the worldly widow, and
is well seen and delightfully heard in the
part. Maud Gordon, a talented newcomer,
is a handsome young woman of fine stage
presence, and shows marked ability as
Harriet Leicester. Lillian Andrews is the
cantankerous Miss Clementina to theÂ«llfe,
and the pretty comedy, wholesome, clean
and sweet, is a very welcome addition to
the dramatic fare of the day.
Mr. Neill paid his respects to the com
pany, audience and critics (of last year)
In a neat little speech after the third act,
after repeated curtain calls.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The Orpheum's headliner of the week is
the wonderful Agoust family, virtuosi in
the juggling profession. They juggle with
everything from an egg to a tureen of hot
soup, and are the artistic limit of their
trade. Mclntyre and Heath are good fa
miliar names: the clever Davis children
and Barnes and Sisson, Alf Grant, Mile
Adelaide, Clayton, Jenkins and Jasper
and the great Goldln are holdovers from
last week's bill.

IGNORES NOTIFICATION
OF THE INJUNCTION
Manager of Clark Eailway Force at
TJvada Awaits Official
Service.
SALT LAKE, April 28.-According
to a Herald special from Uvada, Utah,
Cclonel Maxson, who Is in charge of the
Clark forces on the disputed right of way
near Uvada, was to-day served with
notice by the representatives of the Ore
gon Short Line that an Injunction had
beer. Issued by the United States Court
at Carson City, Nev., prohibiting the San
Pedro Company from Interfering with the
Shcrt Line in its construction of a rail
road between Uvada, Clover Valley Junc
tion and Ploche. Colonel Maxson refused
to accept service on the ground that the
order lacked official Identity and at once
dispatched word to his men at the front
to ignore the order.
The Clark forces, however, are prepare
ine to yield gracefully to their rivals as
soon as the United States Marshal serves
official notice. Until that time, they de
clare, they will hold every Inch of ground
they now possess, even at the risk of a
fight. In this decision they are upheld
by the officials of the Clark interests in
Salt Lake and Los Angeles, who have
telegraphed them to make no further con
cessions.
BEAUMONT, Tex., April 28.-Two new
oil gushers were struck here to-day. The
first is on what is known as the Gladys
City property. It was permitted to spout
or.ly a few minutes, when, after proving
itirtlf the equal- of any of the others, the
valve, which had been previously ar
rcrged, was closed and the How stopped.
KANSAS CITY. April 28.â Foreign
stockholders of the Port Arthur LÂ»and
Company have interposed an objection to
the bale of 28.0W) acres of land at I'ort
Arthur. Tex., negotiated last week, ac
cording to local oillcials of that company.
â¢Nejrouatlons for the sale of the land,
which lies around Port Arthur and be
tween that city and Beaumont, were prac
tically consummated In Kansas City last
Â¦week for a sum said to have beeen $250 an
acre. The prospective buyer was W\ J.
McKle of Corslcana, Tex., said to lie the
legal representative in Texas of the Stan
dard Oil Company. The property is in
the hands of K. L. Martin, Arthur E.
Stilwell and J. SIcD. Trimble of this city,
former owners of the Kansas City, .Pitts
burs and Gulf Railroad, as trustees.
These officials .assert that they have full
power to dispose of the property. Mr.
Martin confirms the sale of an undivided
half Interest in the land, but said:
"Some one seems to have wired some
of the foreign stockholders In the com
pany that we were about to give away a
good thing. They notified us not to de
liver the deeds until they had further in
formation on the subject. In the mean
time, however, the deeds had been sent to
Corsicana, but we telegraphed the bank
there to hold them until further notice."
Mr. Stilwell declined to discuss the de
tails of the deal. He says, however, that
the result of it would be the centering of
the oil industry of Texas in Port Arthur.

Diseases and
Weakness of
MEN ONLY
By far the greater number of patients seek-
ing relief for so-called weakness are strong
robust men in every other respect. Our theory
that Impotency, Prematureness, etc.. are not
' weaknesses but the symptoms of inflammatory
Â¦ processes in the Prost&te Gland (so called neck
of bladder) caused by contracted disorders and
' early dissipation, la now being adopted by the
leading specialist* of the world, and that bug-
bear, â¢ "Weakness of Men." Is removed from the
list of Incurable disorders. Even the layman
can understand that tonics cannot cure Inflam-
mation, and these cases, under their adminis-
tration, go from bad to worse. Under our
local plan of treatment, directed toward re-
ducing the enlarged and swollen Prostate, im-
mediate results, as indicated by increased cir-
culation and renewed strength, are observed.

Â¦ . ' Babbitt Goes In.
The rain which falls upon baseball
grounds as well as grain .fields 'cut tho
local fanatics to the oulck yesterday. The
grounds were too sloppy and the rain too
Insistent for an afternoon, gamo, but over

a scorn of 7 to 6.
In the third inning Oakland hnd a quiet
run-making time. Four of tho Brummela
crossed the rubber, going and coining, duo

Empire Gun Shoot.
At the Empire Club's shoot at Alaraeda
Point yesterday only a part of the scores
were shot through in the Sweeney record
modal, and the Allen handicap had to be
postponed on account of the rain. Webb
made the highest score for the day for
tho Sweeney, medal, which Is also the
highest average for the season ln
this event. Taking Into consideration
that he was obliged to shoot five birds
from the 16-yard mark and five from the
IS, and was able to break three
pnlrs of doubles and the first bird of the
fourth pair from the 20-yard mark, he
certainly did srood shooting by making a
consecutive run of 17 breaks. Scores for
tho several events that were completed

enough that there are still many good
horses here.
Tim Murphy, one of the keenest of the

only prodigy â among announcers â Joe
Humphreys; the young man with the va
riegated slang and the tin-horn voice.
Humphreys said he was willing to
do tho job, but â these are his own
words â "as it is a local custom that
Mr. William Jordan should appear within
the ropes and announce to the feverish,
breathless and palpitating multitude, the
identity of the gloved gladiators, I shall
withdraw in his honor. Never could man
give way to a better." Jordan was most
pleased to hear of Humphreys' magna
nimity. Since the latter arrived on the
scene Jordan has been wasting away out
of sheer fear that his ancient honors and
occupation would be torn from him.
Crowds gathered at both training quar
ters yesterday and saw the fighters in
their last work. Each man is confident
and satisfied that victory will wait upon
him Tuesday night,.

Is Quietly Married.
The many friends of George Kolb, chief
engineer of the transport Sherman, will
be surprised to hear that he has joined
the ranks of the benedicts. By everybody
he was considered a confirmed bachelor,
but Cupid was too powerful, and George
succumbed. As soon as the boys on the
transport wharf learn where he is making

STAKE HONORS
FOR WEDGEWOOD
Jones' Fast Hound Beat
Little Sister in the
Final.
Talent Gets a Heavy Pall
in the Defeat of
Luxor.
A large crowd was In attendance at tha
closing rounds of the 112-dog open stako
yesterday at Union Coursing Park, and
despite the stormy weather a sood day "a
sx>ort was had.
F. Jones' Wedgewood took first money,
beating Frank McComb'a Little Sister
handily In the deciding round. Wedge
wood was In great trim, his condition be
ing equal to that of a few months back,
when he figured often and prominently In
stakes of class. In the going yesterday
he was ready and willing, beating such
good ones as Brutus, Rival Artist, Ever
Sure. Silver Cloud. Flying Fox and Little
Sister and leading them all to the turn.
The short-ends did not materialize as*
often as on the previous day, nor did
they average at such fancy prices. TnÂ©
surprise of the day, and a costly one. too,
to the ones who set the odds, was the de
feat of Luxor in the semi-rtnal. The well
known performer went through until then
in such phenomenal stylo that ho was an
odds-on favorite for last honors, with a
strong play on him at that. Lovlna, Ltona
tide and llarlean Gladys, coursers of re
pute, went out to Luxor without scoring
a point, and For Glory following as a vic
tim with but a single mark to nts credit.
It was an excusable error of Judgment
after such doings that the talent thought
him a 5 to 1 shot acalnst Little Sister.
The odds were freely offered and aa
quickly taken, a heavy play resulting.
Luxor got a point for speed in the course,
and the five that were accredited to Mo-
Comb's champion were gained by her
cleverness after Joining In. Wedgewood
disposed of the victor about as easily.
White Hat. Connell Brothers 1 clever
youngster, was returned a winner against
Forest Kins, a 5 to 1 favorite, and fol
lowed up his good work by giving Hot
Haste a hard run In the next round. Firm
Fellow's work. too. was of the good kind.
He disposed of Master Lawrence and
Charta, the latter pointless and on the
short end.
Fiery Face did well, but was a victim
of hard luck. Against Liberator she wa3
given the hardest kind of going, though
she finally landed at 2 to 1.
Thelma beat Mamie Pleasant at 7 to 1,
Rollicking Airs beat Master Rocket at 4
to 1. Charta beat Sir Pasha at 5 to 2. For
est Queen beat Lough Neagh and >far
cissus beat GreenhaU at 5 to 3.

Meeting Called to Consider the Ad
visability of Closing the
Through Service.
LOS ANGELES, April 28.â G. W.' Luce
and a party of other, local officers of the
Southern Pacific j left yesterday for San
Francisco, . where they will confer with
President- Hays aad Manager Julius
Kruttschnitt upon the advisability of clos
ing the through service between this city
and San Francisco over the coast line.
It has been already determined that the
fast through service will be held up for a
time, but whether the Chatsworth tunnel
is completed or until the line between San
ta Barbara: and Saugus can be relald with
rail of the proper weight has not been
decided. . Â¦ --
If the road is to wait until the comple
tion of the tunnel, it will be fully a year
before through traffic Is resumed. If it
is to wait until new track is laid, six
months- will be the limit. A complete re
arrangement of the time tables of the San
Joaquln Valley, route will be made neces
sary, by the proposed changes.

Begay's Conduct and Suppress
Him With Bullets.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., April 28.â A
Navajo Indian boy, who is attending the
Government school here, has received a
letter from his parents telling him -that
some of the tribe had to shoot and kill
Hostlen Boettlu Begay, a noted chief of
these Indians.
Hostlen for years has. been considered
partially demented and very . dangerous.
He had brought about on several occa
sions serious trouble between white set
tlers and Indians and in November, 1892,
when deputy sheriffs went to arrest some
turbulent Navajos, he led the fight against
the officers, when several of the latter
were killed. Since then he attempted to
rule a small band of Navajos and became
so threatening that they held a council of
war and shot him dead. The affair oc
curred on the reservation west of this
city. â¢ .

Just before the black cap was adjusted
"Black Jack" glanced at the stranger. He
nodded his head and the stranger an
swered with a nod. Just before the trap
was sprung the stranger moved quietly
to the entrance and stood there. In the
excitement that followed the execution
the stranger hurried out, mounted his
horse and galloped away.
It was just before 1 o'clock on Friday
afternoon that one of the guards outside
the 1all at Clayton saw a man ride over
the ridge behind the jail and down to the
stockade about the gallows. The man tied
his horse in the shadow of the jail. Then
he walked over to the entrance to the In
closure around the gallows. He had no
pass. He walked calmly by the guard at
the entrance and did not turn his head
when asked for a pass. The guard let
him by. . .
When "Black Jack" was brought out by
Sheriff Garcia at 1 o'clock the stranger
moved behind three men. He placed him
self so that "Black Jack" could see him
as he passed. Two men had been watch
ing the stranger, and one of them told
the story of the- incident in Denver to
night. They saw "Black Jack" flash a
glance of recognition toward the stranger
and saw It answered. The desperado con

tremor.

amount of deposits Is something less than
$1,000,000, the securities on their face value
something ,iess than $1,100,000. the num

WASHINGTON, April F. Sayler
of Iowa, the special agent in charge of
the beet-sugar investigation of the De
partment of Agriculture, is in Washing
ton, and has submitted his report to Sec
retary Wilson. He says this year shows
a very active tendency toward the Insti
tution of new beet-sugar enterprises.
Next autumn, he says, Michigan will
have three new factories, and Ohio, In
diana, New York, Colorado, Utah, South
Dakota, North Dakota and Illinois will
install new factories, making thirteen
throughout the United States now in
contemplation. A conservative estimate,
he says, Is that there will be forty-two
beet-sugar factories in operation
throughout the United States by the end
of next autumn. Everything indicates
that the Industry is thoroughly estab
lished throughout the country.
Mr. Sayler says: "Even in the lncip
iency of the industry these factories have
shown good profits. They have main
tained themselves without any apparent
real contest with the sugar trust. The
sections of the country that seem most
adaptable to the industry are -where
conditions call for new resources, as in
Michigan, where there has been a phe
nomenal increase within the last three
years, largely due to the waning of the
lumbering industry of that region. There
will be fourteen factories there next sea
son California is the leading State in
production, with eighteen factories, in
cluding the largest in the world. The
Immense amount of pulp and refuse left
after the extraction of the sugar appeals
especially to farmers and industries that
grow out of farm products." . _ Â¦' â¢
Mr. Sayler says that no other feed for
stock is so valuable and so cheaD as
beet pulp. The beet-eugar factories turn
out from. 45 to 50 per cent of the original
weight of the beets worked in the form
of refuse or bi-product. Sugar beets seem
to respond especially to cultivation in
tne arid region, where they have given
better results than any other crop. , The
arid section has been enabled to cope
with other sections of the country where
the crops have been produced by natural
rainfall, not in the amount of tonnage
per acre, but in the higher sugar con
tents and the purity of beet. The results
In Utah have demonstrated the feasibil
ity of the central plant Idea, with
branches scattered at numerous points
for performing some detailed part of the
work.

The police to-night discovered that An
nan bought strychnine yesterday at
Heath's drug store, Sixth avenue and
East Twelfth street. It Is suspected that
he took enough of the poison last night to
bring on the intense agony he suffered,
but the quantity he took was insufficient
to cause death. Whether he took more
this morning is pot known. The Coroner
will, in view of these new facts, make an
analysis of the stomach's contents.
The body was found by W. Richardson,
who resides at S18 Broadway. The Coro
ner has charge of the case. Annan was
CO years of age, a native of Missouri. A
wife and five children survive Him.
Tliis morning Annan arose and said he
was going to the barber shop. He never
reached there, but headed apparently for
the estuary, for what purpose the family
can only surmise, knowing under what
stress of mental trouble he had been la
boring. They duspect he intended to
drown himself. It is thought that while
Annan was walking out to the basin he
was seized with an attack of his stomach
trouble and fell off the board walk dur
inc a paroxysm of pain.
The accident must have occurred be
tween 8 and 10 o'clock. Mr. Annan had
been suffering very severely last night
from stomach trouble. .Recently he lost
$5000, and the physical ailment had ac

FALLS TO DEATH
FROM BRIDGE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. April 2S.
The grave question as to whether the
High Schools of Oakland will be kept
open until the end of the term Is being
pa ssed around from one body to another.
The teachers will be asked whether they
will teach for about six weeks -without
ai.y pay. As this request Is to be made
by the Board of Education, which holds
the positions of these teachers at It3
mercy, the indications are that the teach
ers will very generally consent to teach
for the remainder of the year without
pay, or take their chances, which are very
remote, of getting the City Council to find
some way out of the dilemma.
The School Department deficit and tha
kftping open of the High Schools has
been one of the most artistic cases of
"passing the buck" that was ever prac
ticed In the city government of Oakland.
The Board of Education that haa Just
passed out of office knew full well that
if it put the Central School upon a highs
school basis it would have to face a deficit
at the end of the year, because County
School Superintendent Crawford notified
the board that he would not pay the
salaries of the teachers and that they
wovild have to be met by the city. But
the old Board of Education decided that
It would go ahead and pass the settlement
o" the difficulty down to the new board,
which would take office just about tha
time that the deficit would occur.
The new Board of Education- found a
deficit of something less than $20,000 and
pitceeded to pass the matter to the City
Ccuncil, which was confronted with a
deficit of its own. It simply asked the
City Council to furnish It with enough
money to run the school3 and then waited
for the Council to squeeze an already dry
treasury.
But the Council was not going to bo
made the scapegoat for something with
which it had nothing to do and after de
livering itself of various and sundry re
marks about the method of running thÂ»
schools of Oakland in defiance of an abso
lutely certain deficit it managed to scrapÂ©
together $9200, which It transfered to the
high school fund yesterday at a' special
session. This will only suffice to pay
salaries until May 1 and in spite of tha
bland demands that $10,000 more be sup
plied, the Council has passed the matter
back to the Board of Education without
further action.
The Board of Education held an In
formal meeting last night. There was no
way out of the matter except to ask the
teachers to serve for the rest of the term
without salary or take their chances on
the future. The Board of JSducation. de
cided that it would never "a to close the
schools, particularly as it hopes to be able
to ccntinue the Central School* as a high
school. To close the schools and then
cortmue the cause of the closing would
crtate too much sentiment against the
Central School and so the Board of Edu
cation delegated the . High School Com
mittee and the Classification Committee
to visit the High School on Monday and
interview the teachers, asking them ti
ccntinue the school and take their
chances on salary.
School Superintendent McClymonda
claims that a majority of the teachers
will consent to work upon this basis and
it Is quite probable that they will If the
Board of Education makes strong enough
representations to them. '
P. M. Fisher, principal of the Central
High School, says that he and his force
will teach until the end of the term,
salary or no salary.
""My teachers will all be on hand on
Monday." said Mr. Fisher, "and we will
finish the term, taking our chances of
getting any salary at all. It would be a
very bad thing to close the high schools
now and it is fit that the teachers of Oak
land should stand by. the schools in thÂ«
present emergency."

COLLEGE CADETS'
ANNUAL DRILL
Captain Bouquet decided that he would
not attempt to beat home without his jib
and made for Point Richmond, where the
craft was anchored and the party was
taken ashore with some difficulty and not
a little wetting.
There were fifteen in the party that
started from the clubhouse this^norntng
for a cruise on the Hope. The day was
appointed for a club cruise, but the com
modore signaled that the cruise was off
because of the storm. Some of the yachts
men decided to go out, and among them
was Ernest Bouquet of Alameda, owner
of the Hope. His wife accompanied him,
t.Ipo a number of invited guests, among
whom were Mr. and Mrs. N. L. Meade, Ed
"Woolford and Ed Welch of Alameda.'
The vessel was taken up the bay and
headed toward California City. On the
beat across the bay the Hope's Jib was
carried away and the vessel became al
most helpless. She fell off into the trough
of the sea and gave some of the party a
lively fright before the navigators man
aged to ease her up and keep her head In
the wind.
A pleasure party on the California
Yacht Club boat Hope met with a mishap
t o-day and v-ts compelled to leave the
partially disabled craft at Point Richmond
;;nd complete the journey home to Ala
meda by way of the Santa Fe ferryboat
San Pablo to Pan Francisco.

LOUISVILLE. Ky., April 28.â In the
Kentucky Derby to-morrow, it is believed,
Alard Scheck will be first choice in the
betting and His Eminence second choice,
and many turf followers to-night say that
the chances are that the finish will find
these two horses in the same position as
the betting. The Tennessee crowd will
back Scheck heavily, especially the Mem
phis part of It. and Lexington and the
Blue Grass contingent are said to be
ready to bet a fortune on Sannazaro, who,
by some, is thought to have Quite a
chance. -
The track Is lightning fast, and as the
weather promises to be perfect a new rec
ord may be made. The crowd bids fair
to De the largest ever seen at Churchill
Downs. Cincinnati has arranged to s*nd
two trainloads and Indianapolis, St. Louis
and Chicagro will be well represented. The
entries and jockeys are: Alard Scheck,
Henry: Sannazaro, O'Connor; His Emi

caused death. Mrs. Sexton had been with
him constantly from 11 o'clock Thursday

realizing that he could .not live long the
husband told all of his story and was for
given. Funeral arrangements will be made
on the arrival of Sexton's"father from San

Plus IX was celebrated tn v ;i!l - Oatholic
churches joUcr-iny, the day act npart for
the feast boinir the third Sunday' after
Easter, was honored yeatcrday with a
solemn high mass, an augmented choir
and special services ut St. Ignatius
Church. . â¢
At the high mass, begun at 10:30 o'clock,
Rev. Edward Allen, S. J., was the c<>le
brant. He was assisted by Father Miller,
S. J., as deacon, and Mr. Ryan, S. J;, as
sub-deacon. Thirty-four acolytes were
within the sanctuary. The altar Â¦ was
magnificently decorated with flowers and
glittering candelabra. Father Cottelli, S.
J., had charge of the choir and special
music was rendered.
Rev. Joseph A. Mulligan,' S. J., preached
a doctrinal sermon, explaining: the rea
sons that save rise to tlio particular de
votion and celebration. His text was: "I
will place you over my house and at the
command of thy voice all people shall
obey. Only on the kingly throne shall I
be above thee."
Father Mulligan's discourse was divid
ed into four parts. First, ha considered
the source of St. Joseph s sanctity as
shown by his Intimate relations with the
Incarnate word and the ' blessed virgin
Mary. Then, owing to this sanctity, the
church, following the example of our
Lord, has chosen - St. Joseph as the
patron and protector of the universal
church, which was typified in, the 1 holy
family of Nazareth.'
"How truly the house of Nazareth is
typified in the church is rÂ»3 a scene in the
mysteries of Bethlehem and Nazareth,
Egypt and Galilee, Tabor and Mount Cal
vary. Then Pope Leo IX,- Jn order thar:
all the faithful might in their pressing:
necessities have a powerful nrotoctor.
declared him the universal protector and
guardian of the Catholic church."
Rev. Father Cappa. S. J.. . celebrated
solemn high vespers in the evening. I
A committee was appointed to have 300
price lists printed and distributed among
the shops. The prices now to be regard
ed as union rates are as follows: Shaving,
15 cents: hair-cutting, 25 cents; shampoo,
25-,cents: sea foam, 10 cents: trimming
beard; 13 cents; children's halr-cuttlng,
25 cents.
The proposed raise was adopted and the
head of a family of whatever number has
no -appeal from It, as the Boss Barbers'
Protective Association is getting stronger
every day. Fifty new members were en
rolled yesterday, including five proprie
tors of shops that have heretofore charged
but 5 cents for a shave. All of the more
important 10-cent shops have Joined the
union and, very few places remain in the
city where a. shave can be had for less
than 15 cents. The. association now has a
membership of 225.
S. Heller , was elected recording . arid
financial secretary and S. 'Fried was
chosen sergeant at arms. ' .';â¢
This decision was not reached without
opposition. Â¦ ; A Â¦ lCnsr. , and . stubborn debate
was held over the proposition. There were
those amonjr the proprietors present, who
feared the effect of such a rulo on their
weekly receipts. It wns pointed out, that
the old way. of turning a rice* bowl ovor
the boy's head and cuttlngr away the hair
that sticks out beneath Its edge mlsrht
b'ocomo tho general practice again If tho
charge for the more sightly article turned
but' by the- "tonsorlal artist" should be
made the same for tho tow-headed lud
of 5 and the grizzled victim of barbers'
garrulity. On the other hand, It was ar
gued that' more time and labor are expend
ed In cuttlnsr the hair of the average
squirming boy, to 'say nothing of the ef
fort necessary to convince the fond moth
er that her son. Is not being â¢list! wired for
life, than In putting into shipshape the
shaggiest adult head of hair.
In future when Johnny Is sent to get his
hair cut mamma must erlve him two bits
to pay tho barber. At the third meeting
of the new Boss Barbers' Protective Asso-.
elation, held yesterday aftornoon at 102
O'Parrell street, It was decldad to raise
the union price for children's halr-cuttlng

vent to work. Well, In eierht months the
stock went from $1,000,000 to $25,000i000.
That's an indication. I don't own a dol
lar in the thing nor do any of my friends,
but I believe that the greatest copper
mines In the world have been located
there, and that there Is enough copper
now in sight to reduce the price in the
world.
Marvelously Rich Ore.
"Think of copper mat, after reduction,,
running 55 per cent metal! Think of this
great ledge that I saw in one mine alone,
where there is not a particle of waste! It
is unheard of, and these New Yorkers
that are interested with Green have, I
believe, countleis millions in sight. â¢
"Why did .we sell? Well, it was either
sell at the figure which Green offered, a
much higher amount than he would have
had to pay if he had condemned under the
laws of the country, or stand a lawsuit
which the mining people could not have
helped winning-. We sold at a nominal

figure, getting rid of the entire property
at a price that returns our investment to
us with about 4 per cent interest.
"Of course we missed our opportunity
In not developing the mineral wealth on
the lands. It was a miss, to be sure, but
it's no use to cry over spilled milk. If I
had gone into the thing when the stock
was offered to me I would have been able
to present Oakland with a magnificent
manual training school and to do much
more that I have In mind for the benefit
of the city.
"And to think it is only a few years ago
that Geronimo was at bay on these very
mountains of. copper that are being re
vealed to the startled eyes of man! .
To Build Railroads and Smelters.
"Green's syndicate is preparln~ to erect
big smelters at the mines, and a railroad
is to be built from Blsbee, Ariz., into the
mines and to Narcata, which will be the
town site for the mines. It is about 109
miles from Benson, Ariz. I had to stage
seventy-seven miles to get into the mines.
I am sure that within a couple of years
there will be a town there as big as
Butte, Mont. The copper will be smelted
and sent to New York and other markets
in ingots. Copper isÂ«worth 17 cents a
pound at New York. Say it is worth 15
cents a pound at the mines. That's $300
a ton. The smelters can handle 100 tons
a day. Why, It figures Into Â¦ millions so
fast that it is fairly dazzling."

specimens of the ore, which he has placed

localities recently and stealing from the
rooms. A number of complaints have
been received at police headquarters re
cently of such stealings. Nothing Is
known about Howard, who Is a youth,
and it is supposed Allen has Introduced
him to ways that are dark.
Howard and Allen were last night iden
tified by several men from whose rooms
they had stolen valuable property. The
purse containing $5 and a watch and chain
which were found on Howard were Identi
fied as the property of William Klintt,
whose room was entered by the crooks
yesterday morning. ;;#
Both Howard and Allen are well known
to the police. Allen, who has served sev
eral terms In the penitentiary. Is deemed
one of the most expert room thieves in
the. country. It is the Intention of the po
lice to place a prior conviction against
him in the hope that he will receive a
long sentence In San Quentln.
NOTORIOUS ROOM THIEF
PLACED UNDER ARREST
Advertising men who are' desirous of
lifting their business out of the depths
into which at times It has been unfortu
nately dragged by irresponsible persons
and professional "grafters" formed an or
ganization at the California Hotel yester
day morning, which will hereafter be
known as the Advertising Men's Associa
tion of California.
Fully twenty-five of the men who act
as the medium between the advertiser
and the publisher were present. All
classes of newspapers and journals were
represented. When the constitution and
by-laws, which had been prepared by a
committee appointed at a previous meet
ing, came up for adoption a spirited de-
Imto followed. Every effort was exerted
by the debaters to make the constitution
po stringent as regards membership that
no undesirable person could become a
member.
As adopted, two classes of membership,

FAIR METHODS
MUST PREVAIL
BECAUSE United States Senator
George C. Perkins did not realize
the tremendous possibilities of de
velopment on some big ranch hold
ings of his in Mexico the city of
Oakland has lost a magnificent gift In the
ehape of a manual training school and
other public benefactions. The Senator's
day dreams have gone a glimmering, and
a syndicate of New York capitalists,
headed by W. C. Green, have made what
appears to be a fabulous strike in min
eral wealth. In brief, the Senator has
lately parted with his holdings in the
State of Sonora, upon which have been
uncovered vast stores of copper ore in suf
ficient quantities, in the estimation of
Senator Perkins, to reduce the price of
copper throughout the world. He is cer
tain that there has been discovered the
greatest copper mines in the world, al
though Senator Clark, the Copper King of
Montana, and others presumed to be
equally erudite on the subject of mines
have passed by this wonderful deposit
where hundreds of feet of ore are now in
j sight, running as high as C5.per cent pure
I copper. "''Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦â¢ :
Found on Perkins' Property.
And all of this tremendous wealth is lo
! cated on lands that for sixteen years have
I been owned by Senator Perkins, who pur-
I chased the 3.000.000 acres over w*fr v â¢',._
j ronimo and his Apaches roamed before
i their capture by Uenerai kuis.
The Senator arrived home in Oakland
last night, having been to Mexico to close
up the sale of the lands to the Green
syndicate. He was forced practically to
part with the property, because of the pe
culiar land laws of Mexico. They {jive
| persons right to "denounce" or to locate
' lands for gold, silver, copper and lead
mining on private property. It v;as the
clever prospecting done by Green, who
knows the country there like an open
book, that uncovered these enormous
mines. For many years the presence of
copper on the Perkins rancho was known,
but a number of experts who had exam
ined it eaid there was nothing there but
surface croppings. Senator Perkins knew
that the Clark people haa investigated the
deposit and ha.l reported unfavorably, so
he gave no heed to the proposition.
As he sat stirring the embers of a big
wood library fire at his home In Oakland
yesterday Senator Perkins told the story
of how he missed being a copper Croesus.
Said the Senator:
"I haven't any regrets, but I am sure
that there isn't in the wide world such a
bunch of mines as those on the ranch I
have Just sold. The ore in sight is some
thing beyond comprehension. Think of
one mine where there is a ledge 300 feet
long, 20 feet thick and goodness knows how
deep. They are down now about 200 feet,
and this ore runs from 10 to 65 per cent
copper, with $15 to $17 a ton silver.
"And you want the story of how I lost
this enormous fortune. Well, here go.es.
Bought for a Cattle Range.
"Sixteen years ago W. T. Garrett, the
brass founder of San Francisco, now
dead; H. L. Drew, a banker of San Ber
nardino; Richard G*rd, the beet sugar
man. and myself bought this great tract
of land in Sonora, intending to stock the
ranch and use It for a cattle range. It
was in the neutral zone, across the line
from Arizona, and very tine pasture. Mr.
Gird's brother became a Mexican citizen
and got the land through the Government
on much the same proposition â¢ as applied
to the Spanish grants of California.
"We had the title confirmed In due
time, but grants to pasture lands In Mex
ico do not carry title to certain minerals
that may be on the lands. Any person
can go on to private lands and locate for
gold, silver, copper and lead. That is ex
actly what W. C. Green did.
"We had Intended to stock the rancho,
but Mr. Garrett died and we never, got to
that point. The Mexican cattle running
wild over the ranges have about cleaned
cut the pasturage.
"For many years we knew that there
had been mining on the Cannoneer ranch,
one of the properties we held. We knew
that there was copper and silver there,
but had not the slightest Idea of the vast
ness of the deposits. Green had lived in
that country and was well acquainted
with all of Its possibilities. He located,
I think, eight mines on our property and

NEW MILITARY
ORDER FORMED
On Saturday night young Hathaway
went to the lodging-house and rented a
room. At that time he did not appear to
be disturbed In mind and gave no intima
tion.that he was about to take his own
life. Shortly before 11 o'clock yesterday
morning the bedmaker noticed the odor
of gas on the second floor. He at once
started an investigation and found that
the deadly fumes were emanating from
the room of the youthful lodger/
.The door was forced when Hathaway
failed to respond to a call, and his almost
lifeless body was found stretched out on
the floor attired only in underclothing.
The young clerk was just gasping his last
when the ambulance reached the scene. In
the room were found the fragments of let
ters that he had destroyed. As other mis
sives remained intact in his pockets it is
supposed that- the ones destroyed would
reveal the cause of his death.
Detective Coleman was detailed on the
case, but was unable to obtain a clew
that would lead to the explanation of the
boy s act. It is supposed, however, that a
love affair caused despondency, and the
destroyed letters tend to strengthen this
theory.
Charles -F. Hathaway, a sixteen year
old clerk employed by Sherman. Clay &
Co., committed suicide in a lodging-house
at 737, Market street yesterday morning by
turning on the gas in the room occupied
by him. The cause of his act Is unknown,
but it is supposed to have' been caused by
disappointment in love. The lad was a
recent arrival in this city from Ophir.
Cal., and lived at 937 Post street. 'â¢
