THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.Mr. ICelll himself appears as Clarence,

always amusing- to see the player playing
the actor, and Mr. Neill loses none of the
opportunities of the role. Frank McVicars
Is a perfect manual on "how to be a
Prince at a performance of "Romeo and
Juliet" at Drury Lane Theater, and is al
together a very pleasantly pictured scion
of royalty. There are some strikingly
picturesque situations in "The Royal
Box," the lines are good and there is a
grateful old-world flavor about the play
that is very cleverly caught by Mr. Neill's
good company.
The new bill that opens at the Chutes
to-day includes Memphis Kennedy, musi
cal comedian; Ed F. Reynard, ventrilo
quist; June Mathis, the wonderful child
actress; Irving' Jane, colored song writer;
Ethel May, sweet singer of ballads; Levy

the light farce "Uncle Phlneas," present
one of the most pleasing sketches seen

Charles H. Bradshaw and his associates,
Charlotte Wade, George W. Coakln and

the lines made famous by ' the Hanlons.
The Alcazar's novel attraction of the
week Is Miss Charlotte Thompson's new
play, "Silver-mounted Harness," which
will be seen to-night for the first time
anywhere. Florence Roberts appears as
the heroine, Mrs. Latimer, who Is mar

CHICAGCC Aug. ILâ Dr. L. C. H. E.
Zeigler, who advertised on Friday for the
bodies of 400 human beings on which he
could operate, has found many persons
who are willing to accept Jils grim offer.
Men and women of all conditions of lifeâ
some for money, some for the sake of sci
ence, some who are tired of the trials of
lifeâ have written to the physician and
asked that he meet them and seal the
bargain.
Dr. Zeigler was kept busy all day yes
terday answering telephone calls, reading
letters and meeting: those who. called In
person to sell all but their souls for the
price of a cart horse.
Zeigler expressed the belief that within
six months, the limit he- has set. he will
obtain the 400 bodies.
The first letter Zeigler opened yesterday
Â¦was a short one and to the point. It read:
Dear Doctorâ I have the roods to deliver. Â£

Another read:

Then came a letter from, a man who ex
flained why his 'body was on the market.
t was: "I am willing to make the deed,
as I have no Insurance. E. Galvin, 2215
West Huron street."
Zeigler's search for bodies arises from
his desire to prov^hls contention that
surgery can be performed -without an
aesthesia. He has found, he says, that
patients while under the effect of anaes
thetics move and cannot be photographed
clearly. He desires to make photographic
illustrations of tests, and as there are to
be 400 of them, he is anxious to have

The oil producers assert that they are
ready to meet any phase of competition
which the coal operators may enter upon
and that they can reduce the price of fuel
c.-il to ten cents a barrel, if necessary, and
still make a big profit on the product. At
present the ruling price at Beaumont Is
30 cents a barrel, although some large
contracts have been entered into at 20
cents a barrel.
The capital of the wells of the Beau
mont field already aggregates 1,500.000
barrels of fuel oil daily, and this is being
increased by the development of several
new wells each week. This output is
equal to about 25,000 tons of coal, which
exceeds many times the output of the
coal mines of Texas for the same period.

Appearing before you in this hour of festive

or triumph forces itself upon my lips, only
the modest sensation of joy and gratitude, that
a significant undertaking could ultimately be
carried to a satisfactory, solutions On behalf

in our ultimate success. To those, however, who

President Bundschu accepted the trust
in a strong address. He advanced amid
applause, walking arm in arm with May

by the thousands below, and when the ap
plause had subsided President Bundschu
delivered the dedicatory, address. The
first part was in German and the perora

Accomplished 6tands, what during long tran
sition
Has called for faithfulness and strong sup
port â
Behold! at last success has crowned ambition!
In hopeful confidence we struggled forth,
Resolved to win, we dared and never feared
That at some future time we would succeed.
This day suspense and doubt have disappeared.
Before us stands In sunshine's realmâ the

President Bundschu's Address.
The laurel wreath held by both men sym

spiritual unity which they have given to the
German people we exchange, here on the
shores cf the Pacific, for â¢ the noble civiliza
tion which is being evolved In constant ad

ly we undertook the task of procuring this
monument; most gladly we now give to you
the completed work, feeling that we have
erected a monument to the liberty of the
human mind, a monument to the liberty of
human' thought.

of enjoyins the .thought and the -work of all
men who have gone before.- As the poet has
written, we are "The heirs of all the ages in
the foremost flies of time." From these, our
possessions, the common property of mankind,
we can draw at will. From the exalted posi
tion which it is our good fortune to occupy,
native genius may soar, and on the sure
foundation of past accomplishment native skill
may safely build.
To appropriate, however, the work of other
men or even to take the legacy which is ours,
without expressing pbllgation to our benefac
tors, would prove us selfish and unworthy. So
to-day we are assembled to pay a tribute,
which Is the due of genius, to the great mas
ter minds of Germany, Goethe and Schiller.
They are ours because we make them ours.
Their genius was . so transcendent that they
belong to the world, but proud is the mother
of her sons and proud to-day is the land of
their birth.
- You who came from Germany speak for your
native land; I for our cosmopolitan city â but
who shall speak for art, poetry and science?
Who shall speak for the glory of mankind?
Who Is able to fittingly express the whole debt
of gratitude we owe to mortals such as these?
Yet little did they dream in the wildest
imaginings of Fancy's flight that they w'oulJ
be honored by a monument In bronze by
the far shores of the Pacific. But be it known
to the lasting credit of their fellow country
men who have distinguished themselves In the
upbuilding of the West, that, although sep
arated by a sea and a continent from the
Fatherland, they have during their pilgrimage
carried within their hearts, as the arc of the
covenant, their love, and reverence for Ger
many's greatest names.
Goethe and Schiller loved each other.- There
fore this portrait group shall stand for manly
friendship as well as fame. It will inspire our
youth.. It \wlll adorn our park as ions as
time will spare it from. the ravages of decay.
Here, situated among the flowers so dear to
Goethe, it will serve to awaken our love of
the world's best â¢ literature and our apprecia
tion of its most brilliant exponents.
How dear to us is our Shakespeare, who has
peopled our minds as with living men and
women, representing every human passion and
emotion. He was venerated by Goethe and
Schiller and should stand by their side. . .-
Then let this monument be but the begin
ning of San Francisco's tribute to the great
minds of the world. Let this Concert .Valley
be a temple of fame. Then will the blooms
of flowers and the voice of music on every
holiday bespeak our gratitude and praise.
We thank our German ! fellow citizens for
having suggested the thought and for giving
It such beautiful expression In this work of
their great sculptor, Riethschel, thus wedding
art, literature and the Fatherland in a com
mon memorial. Â¦ â¢ " Â¦
Apart from the consslcuous services which
our citizens of German extraction have, ren
dered this country in every field of human
activity, why should not', the Fatherland have
a memorial? We have been accustomed to
boast of our Ansrlo-Saxon civilization and it
is true the land of Shakespeare 'has given
much to* the world, but back of England were
the r>eoi>le who have given that country its
name as well as Its distinction, the Angles
and the Saxons, who were German tribes and
whose superior prowess wrested the possession
of that country from the native Britons, f
So, whatever benefits Â¦ have been conferred
upon America by Anglo-Saxon civilization, its
origin must be sought in. the ancestors of the
men who â¢ here to-day glorify | the greatest
minds which the Teutonic races have -de
veloped. _ It is the blending of > all people that
has given supremacy to America, and it is a
pleasing office we have to-day to acknowledge
our obligation and Epeak our thanks.
Acceptance of monument.
Park Commissioner McDonald made a
brief address of acceptance in behalf of
the Commissioners. He said future i gen
erations would revere the monument and
express their debt of gratitude to the Ger
man-American citizens for their magnifi
cent tribute to their Illustrious country
men. He expressed the hope that : the
monument would be a bond of sympathy
between the American people and their
brothers from across the sea. ; -'
After the reading by M. Greenblatt of
a poem written by the late Theodore
Klrchhoff , Professor Ewald Fluegel de-.
livered an oration in German. He spoke
as follows:, : ., Â¦Â¦'
â¢ Â¦ On this most Joyous and most glorious day
ever celebrated by the German citizens of Cali
fornia, before the pedestal of this most noble
monument, looking upon numberless proud and
enthusiastic men, upon this blooming landscape
and upon this mighty ocean, it is difficult for
one to master his emotions sufficiently to glvÂ«
expression to the solemnity of the hour. 1 What
Monuments are of greatest import; the best
Berlin and Athens have is their monuments
and the spirit that begot them.
What delisht to have Rletschel's great mas
terwork at. our very doors'. Invisible spiritual
threads connect henceforth San Francisco and
Weimar where the original monument stands
and where the immortal poets rest side by side
This undertaking will in future lead to

The most delightful element in the present
work is its ideally Imperishable character; the
monument was built without consideration of
profit or gain, but solely for the elevation of
mankind.
. This is a memorable day in the history of
our city and of our State, Such noble tasks
are elevatinsr, so we shall undertake more In
the future; monuments will be built to other
poets.
Professor Albin Putzker of' the State
University delivered a strong address on
the subject of the unveiling of the Goethe-
Schiller monument. In substance he said:
We feel happy to-day because in perfect
union we accomplished a great work.
A Great "Work Accomplished.
_ Therefore be proud to-day, thou song-inspired
uerman heart! A monument around which the
love of an entire nation has woven the nimbus
of eternal veneration has risen anew in rejuve
nated form here where the seed of German life
has generated into roots and fruit-bearing
trees under the powerful influences of this grea*
republican commonwealth. 6
Goethe and Schiller's dominating power in the
direction of the development of ideal thought
has been honored and recognized by every
cultured race. Their beautiful creations have
been transplanted by philologists and thinkers
into almost every language, and especially
English and American literature shows a pro
found admiration for their classical genius.
Goethe's earnest, progressive Intuition and his
poetical Idealization of human individuality,
and Schiller's noble, reformatory inspiration for
the pure spirit of liberty against servitude and
inherited prerogatives have placed the poet
friends of "Weimar in the front rank of cosmo
politan significance. Their spirit has followed
us across the bcean, and to-day we lowered
our banners before their noble images, modeled
by artist's touch, and where the waves of the
great Pacific Ocean roar their everlasting mel
ody we placed the wreaths and flowers of our
Golden State at the feet of .immortal genius.

thoughts be felt in many ways, may the scope
of their recognition be broadened and may their

Closing- Ceremonies.
The speaker dwelt on the Infinite practi
cal importance of this thought, which
should become a living force In the daily
life of each one of us. as was the case in
the lives of these "heroes of song and
thought." Dr. Fluegel, finally referred to
the fact that Germany, though torn by
ages of dissension, may point with pride
to several such pairs of famous friends,
who have been honored by double monu
mentsâLuther and Melancthon, Hutten
and Sickingen and the brothers Grimm,
connected as much by common ideals as
by ties of blood, and, lastly, the great
scholars and discoverers, Gauss and
Weber. "Of all I these monuments," he
said/ "the one to Goethe and Schiller ap
peals; most strongly to our hearts and is
the noblest gift which the citizens of Ger
man descent, could offer to this city and
State, and, indeed, to the American na
tion."
The speaker gave an account of the his
tory ' of their acquaintance and rising
friendship. He dwelt upon the coolness
and apparent antipathy which kept them
apart for years. At last. â¢ in June, 1794,
they accidentally met at the session of a
learned society at Jena, and while walking
home together in the night 'they for the
first time "discovered one another."
Goethe dated in epoch of .his life, a new
spring, from this day. J Schiller received
a new inspiration. They met late in the
journey of life, but, as Schiller said: "The
last companions on a long journey always
have the most to tell one another."
Goethe in his large-hearted way then pro
posed that they should henceforth "live
and work as friends, together forming one
whole," each supplementing the other.
In conclusion the speaker quoted Schil
ler's saying: "In striving to recognize ex
cellence there is no liberty but love." This
sentiment, he said, found 'an echo In
Goethe's magnificent words: "Ta recog
nize the divine wherever and In whatever
form it is revealed Is the only true hap
piness on earth."
Perhaps it would be appropriate to select a
subject for this address from one of their many
sayings, or to give a picture of their Indi
viduality, or to speak of their importance to
the literature of Germany and Â¦ of the world,
but it Is the union, the friendship of the two
upon which I desire to dwell. Their friendship
appears, after all,- to be the greatest achieve
ment and glory of their lives.
Friendship of the Poets. i.
a flood of memories arise within us as we con
template these bronze statues. Every one who
Is here to-day knows, reveres and loves these
immortals. Each one of you remembers some
of their immortal sayings, their mighty
thoughts. At the mere mention of Goethe and
Schiller thoughts and Images arise within you
which have been your companions Â¦ since your
earliest youth.
_Mayor Phelan next accepted the' monu
ment in behalf of the city and county of
San Francisco. He spoke as follows;
On behalf of the citizens of Ban Francisco. I

our German- American Â¦ citizens, Â¦ whose thought

As President Bundschu gave the order
to unveil the ' monument all eyes -were
turned toward the terrace where the
double statue, resting on. a massive base
of granije, stood. Standing in front of the
monument, her hands tightly clutching a
rope, was Miss Â¦ Anna Prlber, garbed , in
white. At the signal she gave several
vigorous tugs at the rope and the white
veil slowly divided in front, revealing the
figures of Goethe and Schiller- to the gaze
of the multitude. In another instant the
heroic "figures, with brows uplifted, re
flected the light of the sun and received
the first greetings of an admiring multi
tude. Women waved their handkerchiefs,
men their hats, and from hundreds of
throats a mighty "Hoch!" arose. The
silent figures, so majestic In their rigid
ity, yet seeming to be imbued with life,
looked eastward, as if in a dream of the

The Monument Unveiled.
Unveiling the statue In the name . of the
Goethe-Schiller Monument Association, I com
mend the. same to the guardianship of ' present
and future generations. The veil may drop!
May our fellow citizens accept this token of
our love and esteem In Â¦ the broad spirit of
kindliness in which it has been conceived and
in which it is now tendered to. his Honor the
Mayor of the city and county of San Fran
cisco. Â¦-:,-'Â¦'
This Â¦work of art transplants to these beau
ful grounds of our adopted city a soulful and
historical reminiscence of the greatest period
of German literatureâ a period that enlightened
and advanced their people and strengthened
their sons and daughters in the fulfillment of
their sovereign duties toward themselves and
toward their fellow men.
And thus it may stand as a dreamlike ap
parition of the Old World, as a venerable re
membrance of a consecrated spot in the Middle
States of Germany, as the representative of
the glorious literary epoch of a great and en
lightened nation, as a grave reminder to many
to preserve as far as possible within their kin
the spirit, the advantages and the blessings of
the language of Goethe and Schiller and final
ly as an acceptable embellishment and artistic
addition to these most beautiful surroundings
on the shores of the Pacific. .

tle boat pulled vp close to his vessei.
The captain was evidently nonplussed
for a time and did not answer. The ques
tion was repeated, and this time the cap
tain evidently understood, for he turned
around and speke hastily to one of the
men standing near him. The latter disap
peared for a moment, and when he reap
peared he had a 6hotgun in-his hands.
The captain took the gun from him, tak
ing good care that his movements were
made in full view of the pickets. The
sight of the gun convinced the pickets
that non-unionism prevailed.
They informed the captain that they
were also armed and would not stand any
bluff. Neither would the captain, who
threw the gun to his shoulder and said:
"This is not a bluff. Get out quick, or I
will shoot."

There was very little work clone on the

a few men were working.
The union pickets patrolling the bay in
search of vessels supposed to have or to

the pickets, who patrolled the bay in

At the close of the remarks of the visit
ing teamsters a member of the Brother
hood of Teamsters of Sacramento ad
dressed the meeting. He informed the
strikers that their every move was
watched by the members of the Sacra
mento union, and told them that every
member of the union was in sympathy
with them. He urged them to remain
true to union principles and to make
every effort to win the battle now on. He
assured them that the Sacramento team
sters stood ready to back them with
financial aid.
A delegation from tho Brotherhood of

Issued by the Labor Council under which
the Band teamsters joined the army of
strikers. This was determined upon at a
meeting of the Sand Teamsters' Union
held at 1159 Mission street yesterday. The
meeting was largely attended and was an
enthusiastic one. The members discussed
at length the efforts made by the con
tractors to secure the return to work of
the teamsters employed in keeping the
streets of the city clean, and when the
question was put to a vote every .member
present voted to remain out.
Considerable enthusiasm was aroused
by the appearance of Ed Rosenberg, Â¦ sec
retary of the Labor Council. Rosenberg
delivered an address, in which he informed
the members of the Band Teamsters'
Union of the condition of the laboring
man who walked out in, support of the
cause of labor. He discussed the situation
at length and told the members of the
union to stand fast, as the organizations
which they were supporting out of sym
pathy were looking to them for a show
of determination.

Rev. Dr- Rader Makes Plea From Pulpit for Settle
ment of the Strike and Condemns Coercion,
i Whether by Employer or Employe.
AT a representative meeting of
the Federation cC Improvement
Clubs held yesterday afternoon at
1SQS Polk street It was determined
that the federation should still
continue the eSorts which It had been
making to bring about an adjustment of
the present labor troubles. The plan cf
action will be pursued in. a broader and
mere systematic m&nneft The meeting
decided to increase the conciliatory com
mittee from Id to 100 members. In order
that It might hare more weight with the
contending parties and that there might
bo a sufficient number from which to ap
point sub-committees to more thoroughly
Investigate the status of the trouble* It
was also euggested that tha committee
should establish Its headquarters in the
central portion oÂ£ the clt}%
The Improvement clubs of the city were
well represented at the meeting, and. there
were preeent delegate* from the Retail
Dealers' Association and from, the labor
unions. Although the meeting: was called
for the express purpose of formulating a
plan for the settlement of the present
Etrike, the discussion assumed a broader
ground, and the subject of compulsory
arbitration was considered.
William J. Kenny of the Cycle Board
of Trade, who addressed the meeting', ad
vocated the formatoin of a retail deal
ers' association for the purpose of ap
pealing to the Employers' Association
from a morÂ« practical standpoint. In his
address Mr. Kenny said:
"The retailers must come together _ in
this fight and Bhow the employer* that
they are the principal losers. Thero is
no doubt that the solution of this (jues :
tion rests In the hands of the Employers
Association, and the only way to bring
them to their senses is to address them

have to show them that they are losing
their businessâ that the%- are slaying the
goose that lays the golden egg.
Thomas I* Wilson, fourth vice presi
dent of the International Association of
Machinists, explained the conditions
against which the machinists in their
strike are forced to contend. He Bald
that the machinists have wnceded all
that they can possibly concede, and that
the question had narrowed down to a
simple demand on the part of the ma
chinists for a nine-hour day with ten
hours' payâ a question, he said, which
could not be arbitrated or compromised.
He claimed that the labor leaders, in
stead of being agitators were the means
of lnducinsr the employes to moderate
theJr demands and to preserve tho peace
while on strike. He said San Francisco
was threatened with a loss of her great
machine plants, which, he declared,
might go to Seattle If the strikers were
not treated with justice. In closing he
requested the members of the improve
ment clubs, if they took sides with either
of the factions, to support that side which
would appreciate their efforts.
Addresses were also made by T). R.
McNeill. William H. Barnes, John A. Mil

acted as chairman of the meeting, and

CAUSE OF THE THIED PAETY.
Rev. T>r. Eader Urges From Pulpit
That Strike Be Settled.
The Rev. Dr. William Rader of the First
Congregational Church preached a sermon
last night on the labor troubles which are
at present disrupting the Industrial peace
of the city. He took the side of the third
party, the general public, including the
fanners and orchardists. He said in part:
The side of the strike perceptible to us Is a
picture of loss and destruction. If you stand
too near the firing line your eyes will be blind
ed by the powder flashes and battle smoke.
The rotting- fruit and gTain. the idle wheels,
the horses pasturing In the country, the un
e-srept streets, the policemen upon the drays â
these ma.ke up the dark side of this struggle.
The problem of labor is being solved in trib
ulation. War :s resorted to and In war some
body suffers. For the time being the gospel cf
broiherhood Is as idle, as the strikers, and a
process of starvation is resorted to that one
party may win. It is probable that America
will witness civil insurrections In the future
of immense meaning-. As the storm purifies
the air. so &o strikes sometimes restore health
to the body politic. No settlement arrived at
now will be fundamental. It will be an expe
dient.
Two Sides to Question.
As to the local situation, I have- little or
r.otbln? to say. There are two sides to the
<jueetlor^ Each has its complaist, each its ar
gument. We are facing a condiuon rather than
a theory. It will do no good, to bold mass
meetings or call names. Let us keep thÂ«
church out of the controversy. "We must solve
our own problem. The duty of every man is
to cultivate the eober mind and to stand by
the administration of the city in itÂ» efforts to
have law and order. Let us trust the dtlzen
ehip of respectable labor. Archbishop Ireland
expresses ray vie we. He said: "To employes
entering willingly into a 6trike the matter is
one cf their own personal concern, and others
have but to concede them their personal right
to act In such manner as they wlU. Men are
the masters of their bands and of their labor,
rrovided they understand the consequences that
follow and are satisfied to accept and endure
euch consequence*. But while the right to en
ter upon a strike is and must be conceded as
a right belonging to the personal freedom of
wonungmen, this must be ever demanded â
and in the name of the 6&me- principle of per
sonal freedom under which men may refuse to
workâ that they who may cease to work must
In no way Interfere with the liberty of others
who may wish to work. The personal freedom
of the Individual citizen is the most sacred
ar.d precious inheritance, of Americans."
Revolution Is Certain.
That there li ecmething radically wrong In
modern Industry nobody will deny. The con
centration of wealth has created the concen
tration of labor. The one la the reflection of
the other. To-a have seen the mountain re
flected In the clear lake. If you look into
unionism you will eee outlined the gigantic
trurts. Fire Is fought with fire, federation
with federation, trust with tract. Out of tfils
contest Â¦will come the Inevitable revolution
es eure ee the tides rise and fall. There was
never a time when America so much needed
& great man to settle the contest between labor
crA capital.
Coercion Is Un-American.
There is unfortunately no central authority
by -wWch the trust may be limited or the union
restrained. Self --will la having great - license.
The third party has no court of appeal. The
women end children in the city, the email mer
chant, the consumer*, the ranchman sitting
try bis rotten fruit In our rich valleys, these
fcare no central authority to TfBich to appeal.
They can esly Trait until one party gives in,

..A mob of 400 men clamored for his life,
but the leaders of the mob, numbering
less than a dozen, carried Into execution
the plans of vengeance they had formed.
The rest of the mob was kept at a dis
tance and was not permitted to come
within 100 yards of the stake. This was at
a spot 600 yards from the Clark house.
The negro,, walked to his death without a
tremor. He admitted ills guilt of other
crimes, but stubbornly refused to acknow
ledge that he had assaulted Mrs. Clark.
A crowbar was driven into the earth. To
this Washington was bound in a sitting
position his legs extending straight in
front of him on either Bide of the bar. A
chain held him fast around the waist,
while a heavy rope encircled the bar and
his neck. The leaders of the mob askod
Mrs. Clark to apply the torch to the pile,
but she refused. Her husband was
selected in her stead. Washington looked
straight into the eyes of Clark , as the
latter stooped' down to apply the match.
The wood was pitch pine and saturated
with kerosene oil. The flames leaped
toward Washington's body. The man
showed no signs in his race of the agony
he must have suffered, and met death
without a groan. The leaders of the mob
watched the work of the flames until
Washington's head fell back upon his
shoulders and he died. For some few
minutes longer they waited around the
spot and then dispersed quietly.
The negroes of the country are almost a
unit in approving the punishment and
many were members > of the mob.

To have left that point for Santiago

Having in view the possibility of the ap

the Navy Department officials have se

admiral has made no request for relief.

Common usage justifies' the use of going

a party. to visit another at a distance. In
writing, for instance, to a party in New

visit you In December,'* but if, on the
other hand, the party in New York should
write the question. "Are you coming to
see me next December?" the reply would
generally be, "Ye3, I am coming at that
time," but it would be better to write,
"Yes, I will come at that time."

The value of such a service to the city, is now well

such a sen-ice may be well nigh imperative.
Ever since the daywhen The Call achieved the feat
of receiving by wireless telegraphy the news that the
Sherman was in sight on her way home with the Cali
fornia Volunteers from Manila the people of this city
have taken a keen interest in the new marvel of sci
ence. We should be among the first to have the ser
vice when established, and it is therefore gratifying to
receive assurance from the officials of the Department
of Agriculture that they are looking carefully after
our interests.
Wireless telegraphy has now reached a degree of
development that renders it of practical use, and it is
so used in many parts of the world. Consequently,
since the Secretary of Agriculture is resolved to em
ploy it in the. service of the Weather Bureau, it is
hardly likely that any considerable time .will elapse
before a suitable system has .been obtained for the
service so much desired here.
BY the dispatch published in The Call of Sunday
to the Hon. Julius Kahn from Willis L. Moore,
acting Secretary of Agriculture, concerning the
desired establishment of a system of wireless teleg
raphy between this city and the Farallones there is
afforded a just cause for popular gratification. Mr.
Moore announces that the department has an observer
at Nantucket assisting in the transmission of the Her
ald's wireless reports from the lightship off that island
and that it is probable an additional expert will be
sent. The telegram states: "Secretary Wilson is alive
to the. interests of the Pacific i # Coast, and under his
direction I am bending every effort to either secure
from others or perfect by our own investigators a sys
tem that can be installed at the Farallones."

â¢ Item of California's splendid display.
THE BOGUS TICKET TRICK.
THE BUSINESS TIDE STILL HIGH.
'"T"*HAT the tide of prosperity which has been flow
t ing over the country for several years has not
Â¦Â¦Â¦ yet begun to ebb was graphically shown last
week. In spite of the recent unfavorable weather con
ditions in the West and Southwest, whereby the cereal
and fruit crops were badly damaged, and the labor
troubles in the East which threw large numbers of
men out cf employment and closed down a number of
large plants, the commercial statistics of the country
show exceptionally fine business conditions. The
weekly bank clearings showed a gain of 52 per cent
over the corresponding week last year, and of the
eighty cities and towns reporting clearings only five â
Savannah. Denver. Binghamton, Macon and Helena
reported a decrease from 1900. This is probably the
most remarkable weekly showing on record.
The exhibit shows that trade in the United States is
so heavy and on such a sound basis that neither crop
damage nor labor troubles have the power to affect
it seriously. In fact from all quarters of the country
mercantile reports are flattering. The distributive de
mand for merchandise is brisk everywhere, wheat
exports are large, prices for almost all staples are
either maintained or actually advancing, money is
abundant, and there i? no rabid speculation in Wall
street to worry financial interests. No better business
conditions could exist, and if they continue the year
ioor will be a record breaker in many respects, brill
iant as its immediate two or three predecessors were.
The staples continue to make a good exhibit Wool
is firm and woolen goods, particularly the plainer
sorts, have bc?n liberally ordered ahead. Structural
iron, which thus far has not been affected by the
strike, is in eager demand and the manufacturers are
hard pressed to fill their orders. Eastern boot and shoe
manufacturers report "orders up to their previous vol
ume, while the reports from the West are even better.
Operators in wheat in the West and Southwest are
freely predicting an sdvar.ee in this cereal, though
the wish may be father to the thought Quotations for
corn, oats and hay in the same regions have gone up
materially, and those farmers who get good crops will
receive fine returns.
In San Francisco, in spite of the strike, a large ex
port business is being done, though the bulk of it is by
rail. The West and Southwest are calling on us for
all the potatoes and onions we can spare, and within
the past few days a sharp demand for the bean crop
has sprung; up. Purchases of dried fruit in the country
are heavier than ever before known at this season, and
at better prices than usual, with possibilities of a
t:rther advance later ou. Canned fruits and vegetables
are firm, with a continuation of the demand for the
West alrcsdy spoken of. Wine grapes are in active
demand and buyers arc paying from $20 to $32.50 per
ton for them in the country and willing to make large
contracts at these prices. British Columbia and Alaska
tre sending in large orders for fruit and other'produce
In fact, almost everything that the farmer raises is in
jrisk demand for an immense territory extending from
\ T ome to Texas and the Missouri River Valley. The
latest products wanted are barley and oats for the two
btter sections, and local dealers are now trying to. get
railroad rates which will enable them to ship out large
quantities of these cereals. In brief, there never was
â¢uch a domestic demand for our farm products as that
fthich is now pressing us for satisfaction.
With these conditions California ought to be abun
dantly satisfied. Our crops, while not large as a rule
shis year, are sufficient to bring us in handsome re
turns and we, as well as the other States,' ought to
arcak the business record this year.
VIGILANCE on the part of genuine Republicans
has already brought to light the fact that
among other schemes designed to deceive the
unwary the bosses who are striving to control the
Republican convention have arranged to put spurious
tickets in the field. The trick consists in placing at the
head of the spurious ticket one or more candidates
known to represent the anti-boss element of the party,
while the rest of the ticket is filled with the names of
the henchmen of the bosses. Should many persons be
deceived by such tickets the bosses would make con
siderable gains and might bring about the election of
a number of their gang who could never have been
elected otherwise.
To guard against that and similar tricks that may
be devised between now and the closing of the polls,
genuine Republicans should be careful to read over the
full list of names upon the ticket they vote. The gang
is unscrupulous and cunning. It will not pay to take
chances with them.
â¢ It is to be borne in mind that the bosses are not
resorting to these various kinds of fraud for nothing.
They are aware of the importance of the issue. The
triumph of honest politics in San Francisco would be
felt throughout the State. It is for that reason that
Herrin and Gage have brought to the aid of Kelly
every heeler they could control. We have had intro
duccdinto our local politics the bosses of the interior.
Perhaps it is not accurate to say that the outsiders
were "introduced" into our politics, for thefe was
nothing of conventional manners about the process.
Some of them were sneaked in, some were dragged in
and some may have been kicked in much against their
will. By one means or another, however, they have
been brought in, and the Republicans of San Fran
cisco have upon their hands the task of making clean
the city in which the outsiders have been doing so
much dirty politics after the manner of Kelly.
The issue that has brought about this extraordinary
combination of bosses was raised by the passage of the
primary election law. Kelly and Herrin can no longer
carry the Republican primaries by the brutal pro
cess of assaulting honest men at the primaries or by
the fradulent process'of stuffing the ballot box or mis
counting the vote. The new law gives to every citizen
a right to cast his vote and have it fairly counted.
Thus the bosses perceive that their power is about to
be broken. There is but one way for them to win and
that is by standing together and making use of every
deception that cunning can conceive and rascality
practice. . â¢ â¢}, ;
To the genuine Republicans of, the city the issue
and the occasion are as important as to the bosses.
Therefore, each and every one of them should go to
the polls, and when there scrutinize with care the
ballot that he votes. Remember there is but one anti
boss ticket in any district â it is the ticket of the Re
publican Primary League.

part which California is playing in the big
Exposition now In progress at Buffalo. The
Call has generally backed movements aimed at
California's advancement, especially -when as
sured that the effort was genuine and not In
tended solely to give some third-rate faker or
fourth-rate politician a Job, and hence I as
sume that its legion of readers will be inter

the Pan-American Exposition. To be brief,
then, California has easily the best State ex
hibit at this fair. We have a creditable mln
teral exhibit In the mining building, embrac

handsomely Installed and carefully classified,

The people of San Francisco put those questions to Mr. Hays in order that He may
understand they are not ignorant of what his corporation is doing through its* attorney
W. F. Herrin, and its organ, the Evening Post. For themselves, the people will attend to
their political business and will ''kick Kelly out." Whether in politics or out of it, the
Southern Pacific Company cannot force a boss of the Kelly type upon the Republican
party of this city, when the better elements are aroused as they are to-day. When a set of
men first brand a boss as indecent, dishonest and a rascal, and then with that brand upon
him set about supporting him, their influence with self-respecting people is gone.
Backed by the support given him by the officials and the organ of your corpora
tion, Kelly'has had himself placed at the head of a gang ticket as a delegate for the Re
publican nominating convention from the Twenty-eighth District. That district, be
cause of its number, stands first on the roll, and should Kelly be elected his name will be
first that is called when the convention assembles. He will thus be placed conspicuously
as the representative of Republicanism in this city. He may name 'ttie chairman of the
convention â may dictate the committees.
' If he achieve that triumph, Mr. Hays, it will be mainly because of the support
given him by Herrin and the Post, both of whom are on the payroll of your corporation
and are under your control. Are you willing that men under your direction should take
this man, once denounced by them as a traitor, an impostor and a rascal, and lift him out
of the slums into the eminence at which his impudence aims?
Why is it, Mr. Hays, that an official drawing a salary from your corporation and'
a newspaper supported by a monthly subsidy from your corporation are now upholding
the political pretensions and aggressions of a boss who but a year ago your own news
paper denounced as indecent, a traitor, an impostor, dishonest, a menace and a rascal? .
The people of San Francisco say to Mr. Hays: The Kelly whom the organ of your
company thus described last September is the same Martin Kelly whom the organ of your
company is supporting to-day. Kelly has not changed. He has not reformed nor even re
pented. Why tlien is he now supported by the organ and the attorney of tfie Southern
Pacific Company?
" Kelly Is a Traitor."
"Kelly Is an Impostor."
. "Kelly Is Dishonest."
"Kelly. Is a Menace."
"Kelly Is a Rascal."
Last September the Evening Post, then, as now, an organ of the Southern Pacific
Company, published an editorial plainly declaring Martin Kelly's* character and the
public judgment upon it. In the course of the article the Post said:
"Kick Kellv Out "
"He Is Indecent."
WHEN* President Hays announced that under its new management South
em Pacific Company would attend strictly, to railroad business and abstain
from interference in politics, his words were received .with gratification
throughout California; and when a litttle- later he issued his order to the offi
cials and employes of the road to devote themselves exclusively to their duties to the
business of the company, there was a widespread hope that the; words of the promise were
to be fulfilled â that the railroad was to get out of politics and stay out. Now an elec
tion is at hand. The time has come for President Hays to make good his words. W. F.
Herrin is in politics; the Evening Post is in politics, and ; both Herrin and the Post are on
the payroll of the Southern Pacific Company. Does Mr. Hays regard their activity in
the support of Martin Kelly as a violation of his promise and his order, or not? Thit is
a question the people of California have a right to ask.. It is one which Mr.. Hays can
not evade.

REPUBLICAN PRIMARY LEAGUE
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT TICKETS
In the northern end of the city, at
Washington Hall, corner of Stockton and
Union streets, another big outpouring of
voters will be held. Every Republican of
the Forty-fourth District In favor of good
government Is expected to be present. The
principal speakers will be A. Ruef, D. W.
Burchard and Z. T. Caaon.
Three important meetings will be held
to-night in various parts of the city, and
it is the expectation of the managers cf
the Republican Primary League that all
will be numerously attended. At every
meeting able speakers will be present.
In the Twenty-eighth Assembly District
the meeting will be held at Young Men's
Institute Hall, corner of Folsom and Haw
thorne streets. I>. C. Crane, the president
of the league, will act as chairman of the
evening.
; In the Thirty-third Assembly District,
Maenerbund Hall, Twenty-fourth street
and Potrero avenue, will be the scene of.
the demonstration. A. J. Dannenbaum
and others will speak, while music and
bonfires will enliven the occasion.
iFlnal Mestings.
For instance, in' each district the Re
publican Primary League has sent to
every voter a slip bearing the names of
its candidates. An intending voter should
ask for a Republican ballot,, attach the
paster with the names printed thereon,
and proceed in the same manner as in all
other elections.
The polls will open to-morrow morning
at 6 o'clock and close at 5 p. m. This will
afford every one ample time to vote, but
those whose duties will permit should
vote as early as possible. There Is no
telling what delay might prevent one
recording a vote in favor of honesty and
clean politics.
Another feature Is that the same ballot
box will be used alike for Democratic and
Republican ballots, which will be count
ed by inspectors, judges and clerks ap
pointed- proportionately, according to
the party vote cast at the last election.
The use of pasters is permittedâ another
feature with which voters should famil
iarize themselves.

FREMONT. Neb., Aug. 11.â The , arrest
of Jack Winters at San Francsico and his
subsequent confession to having stolen
$280,000 j from the Selby Smelting Works
recalls the fact that a Jack "Winters -was
concerned in a criminal action in this
place.. On February 7, 1885, Winters was
sentenced by Judge Post of the District
Court to four years at hard labor in the
State penitentiary, having been previously
found guilty by a jury of committing an
assault on a young woman. His reputa
tion at North Bend was unfavorable and
no witnesses were found to testify in. his
behalf. He has never come back to this
part of the State since completing his
term at the penitentiary.

it started in six places at once in the
vicinity of his company's holdings.
REDDING, Aug. 11.â Flakes of ashes
were dropping all day in Redding, and
their appearance was that of falling snow.
The cause was a fierce forest fire across
the Sacramento River, several miles north
of town. Territory six miles in length and
several miles in width was burned over.
A dwelling, the property of J. L. Bass, a
merchant whose place of business is at
Baird, was destroyed. The entire force of

but were unable to stay their progress.

it. refusing .to talk merely. *
Sheriff Veale will in all probability take
Winters to Martinez this afternoon. He
has a warrant sworn out and will arrive
in this city this morning. He left Mar
tinez on the 5:30 o'clock train last night
with the intention of stopping off at Val
lejo Junction. Winters once removed
from this city the scene will shift to
Martinez â for all features of the robbery
but the distribution of the reward. |
Chief Tjees and Captain Seymour had
a handshaking party In the captain's of
fice most of the afternoon. They were
open to congratulations, and the old chief
seemed thoroughly satisfied ' with every
thing, praised everybody in the caseâ but
Vealeâ and even went so far as to dis
claim, any interest in the way the reward
would be distributed. Captain Seymour
was in like frame of mind. Lees compli
mented Seymour and his force of detec
tives, and they they all went out and had
n drink nnd then went home, expressive
of thanks for the speedy ending of a
troublesome Job.
The distribution of the 525,000 reward
is likely to cause some truoble. Lees
seems to think that the work was dona
by himself, Seymour, Sayers of the Pin
kertons and Tom Gibson. But there are
others who are likely to figure in it.

day; so was Sheriff Veale. Lees also

As far as a. prosecution groes, Leea saya
that he Is ready to step forward and
bring: an accusation against Winters, If
no cno else does. This was given with
mucli fcuperlitat of air yesterday. In re
gard to the price offered Winters to con
fess, Lees practically admitted that such
was the case when he defended : that
course of action and claimed that it was
no other than the Selbys' business, and
that they acted within the pale of the
law, as the man had not been charged
with the crime. The money, he says,

from punishment.

Mesa Grande Fiesta In
cludes Sensational
Features.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEX5O, Aug. 1Lâ Two marriages,
two deaths from natural causes and one
man shot. These were the prinlcpal events
at the Mesa Grande fiesta. The Indians
and tome dissolute Mexicans and Ameri
cans had everything their own way during
this year's fiesta, of which the principal
day was August 4, "El rrta de San Do
mingo."
On that day the mothers bring their
babies to be baptized by the padre, and
bashful swains lead still more bashful
maidens to the matrimonial altar. The
first to have the nuptial knot tied this
time was Juan Leo, usually a steady,
hard-working young man, living on War
ner's ranch. The steadiest sometimes
lose their nerve on their marriage day,
and so it was with Juan Leo.
By way of celebrating he filled himself
with intoxicants, which seemed to be plen
tiful, and during the night was Inclined to
be quarrelsome. At midnight he was bet
ting on a peon game. .Somebody called
him an offensive name, when he Imme
diately started to jerk his revolver from
his back pocket. A friend. La Borio Peg
no, saw the movement and instantly
grabbed the pistol, which was acldentally
discharged. Pegno received a painful
wound. The ball went through the fleshy
part of the hand and penetrated his thigh,
where it etill is and will probably remain.
The wounded man was carried to his home
on the Balcan reservation.
During the time this fracas was in
progress another man lay dying close by
in one of the ramadas, amid the mourn
ful and weird wailing of the women. He
had been ill for a long time, and one of his
last requests was that his people take him
over to the fiesta, which was done. An
old woman also died soon after, and then
another couple were married.
The Government has abolished the In
dian police system for this agency as to
tally incompetent, so everything was with
out restraint, and those that desired
liquor had all they wanted. As a conse
quence there was more. drunkennesa and
debauchery than usual.

tactics.
James H. Wilson, whose name has been
used by the Kelly-Crimmins combination
to head their ticket In the Thirty-sixth
Assembly District, is out in an emphatic
denial of the right of that organization to
use it. Frank French, who claims to carry
the district in his vest pocket and is one
of the most trusted of the bosses' lieu
tenants, has placed his name at the head
of a misleading ticket, and circulars have
been placed in the hands of voters,
informing them that the ticket headed by
Wilson became the successors of those
Interested in the original Grand Hotel
committee. Wilson was one of the men
who initiated the Grand Hotel movement,
and after numerous conferences among
the representatives from that district, all
the clubs were consolidated Into the Re
publican Primary League. This ticket is
therefore the only one that represents the
decent element of the Republican p,arty
in this district.

learns that the ex-officio regency is men
tioned in order to boom the Kelly-Crim
mins ticket in certain districts. Citizens
should understand that the cheapest and
lowest grade of politicians sometimes at
tain to ex-ofncio regency. Boss Kelly's
Speaker of the Assembly. "Corney" Pen
dleton of Los Angeles, is Regent ex-oflicio.
The faculty, the student body, the regular
Regents and the enlightened public gener
ally have no more respect for some of the
ex-office Regents than the law allows. The
.attempt on the part of the push politi
cians, however, to use the good name of
tlte Board of Regents to help the Kelly-
Crimmins ticket will excite general con
tempt.
President von der Ropp remained in
San Francisco to-day, but is expected to
arrive on the early morning train to-mor
row to attend to the construction of the
cofferdam, which is to be built around
the gold, material being already upon the
ground. The excitement of the past few
days has somewhat abated now, and to
morrow the search' for the bullion will
probably be continued with better results.
"Do you suppose," said one of the offi
cials, "that this man is to be allowed to
go unpunished after perpetrating such a
crime. Even If we did fail to prosecute
him the law would have to take its course
and Winters is not going to get off as
easy as he may Imagine."
From' some of Winters' co-workers it
was learned that for a long time Winters
was not thought to be in his right mind,
and some give vent to the opinion that
they would not be surprised at any time
to hear that he had become a. raving ma
niac. "Sometimes,'.' said one of them to
day," he would go homo from work in
the evening and appear on the street as
many as six or seven times, and each
time he would have on a different suit of
clothes. This caused much comment
among his fellow workers and gained him
the sobriquet of 'Butterfly Dude.' From
Bll outward appearances Winters was
what is known as a 'woman hater,' but if
rumor counts f or anything he was quite
a figure in the local tenderloin."
being closely guarded by Detective Kem
ble and several other Plnkerton men, and
it goes without saying that no outsider
who values his life will venture near the
resting 1 place of the treasure however
tempting it may seem. All day long the
wharves have been crowded with curioug
onlookers who gazed with awe and won
der at the soot from which many thou
sands of dollars' worth of bullion was re
covered yesterday.
Further inquiries among representatives
of the Selby Company to-day devloped the
fact that there was no compromise with
"Winters and that he would bÂ© prosecuted
to the fullest extent.
Under a statute passed by the last Leg
islature to-morrow has been declared a
municipal legal holiday by the Board of
Supervisors. This means that the de
partments of the city government will not
be open for tho transaction of, business.
It is also collection day. and many mer
chants, in order to afford themselves an
opportunity to vote, have seriously con
sidered the postponement of the semi
monthly gathering in of debts until the
following day. A movement to this ef
fect may be started to-day.
In many other respects the methods of
the coming election are an innovation.
Voters are governed by the same laws
and penalties as the State imposes in a
Presidential, State or municipal election.

A meeting of the executive committee of the
Thirty-sixth District Central Republican Club
was held at Twin Peaks Hall Saturday even
ing last. Chairman Robert Ash presided and
in the course of his remarks stated that the
Kelly and Crimmins Club of the Thirty-sixth
District was using the Central Republican, or
Grand Hotel, Club circulars and endeavoring
to convey the Impression that it represented
the Central Republican Club of the Thirty
sixth District. This is false. It is well known
that we are the recognized Central Republican
Club of the Thirty-sixth District, and that we
have lately affiliated with the Primary League
Club and are equally represented by delegates
on the Primary League ticket, and we have
no affiliation whatever with the Kelly-Crlm
mins 1 Club, of which Frank French is presi
dent, and caution all voters not to be misled
by such underhanded practices, but to be sure
and vote the entire Primary League ticket.

GRIME, DEATHS
AND WEDDINGS
It is unfortunate that a movement that
originated two years ago from a pure
source should have permitted itself to be
deflected and polluted to the extent Indi
cated by this last debasement and sacri
fice of principle. Since the president of
that organization, Samuel C. Irving, was
defeated as the candidate for delegate in
his own district he ha?, for some reasons
best â¢ known to his neighbors and others
best known to himself, assumed a mal
odorous opposition to all that makes for
good In politics. Knowing that the ten
dency of the feeling of the good people
In his district is to the support of the
anti-boss ticket, he has sought on all oc
casions since his personal discomfiture to
vilify and ?buse the Republican Primary
League and its supporters.
Irving, by reason of his association with
a local Institution, is ex-orncio Regent of
the State University. The Primary League
The ghost of the defunct Grand Hotel
party is the Central Republican Commit
tee. In most of the districts this central
committee, so called, has no tickets of its
own, and in order to carry out its plot of
throwing the municipal government into
the hands of the discredited bosses It has
acted in a sneaking fashion and submit
ted to the people the Kelly and Crimmins
ticket as its own ticket.
Tlie Hotel Ghost.
The only safe course for voters to pur
sue is to spurn and reject the tickets in
dorsed by the allied bosses. In the hot
bed of bossism â the Twenty-eighth As
sembly Districtâ Martin Kelly places him
self at the head of the ticket. In that dis
trict he makes no pretense of asking: the
support of intelligent independent citizen
ship. He relies on his own rounders and
such Democratic aid as Sam Rainey can
supply. In the Forty-first District the
allied bosses have directed Dibble to make
concessions to respectability, but the issue
is the same in each district. Kelly is
working with the desperate energy of a
resourceful and determined boss to get
control of the convention and seize the
municipal patronage of San Francisco.
Every Republican who fails to support
the Primary League ticket in this contest
.helps Kelly in his fight against the people.
Only Safe Course for Voters.
If the tickets supported by the allied
bosses should happen to win the people
will not be represented in the municipal
nominating convention. In several dis
tricts where Kelly, Crimmins and the reg
ular push politicians have found the sen
timent overwhelmingly anti-boss the ma
nipulators of the boss machine have nom
inated a few respectable citizens for dele
gates. These respectable men, if elected,
will have no voice in directing the affairs
of the convention. They will be compelled
to vote as the bosses direct, for Kelly and
Crimmins have taken every precaution
known to practical politicians to provide
that the majority shall register the will of
the bosses despite the opposition of the
minority.
this: "Shall the people or the
bosses rule?" The Primary League holds
that the people should govern tho city;
that the municipal nominating convention
should be composed of representative cit
izens. If the delegate tickets indorsed by
the Republican Primary League win out
to-morrow the people will be represented
in the convention. Moreover, the conven
tion will be independent and unpledged.
The league has no candidates for office.
THE delegate tickets put forward
by the Primary League represent
tho anti-boss sentiment of ths
Republican party. The issue is

A barge laden with 53,000 feet of lumber
capsized off Butchertown last Saturday
and nearly the entire cargo was lost. The
lumber was for Stone's shipyard in Oak
land Creek and loaded on the barge
Yolo at Redwood. The stuff was piled so
high that it was unwieldy, and later the
barge began to leak. The launch Sybil
was towing- the load, and Â¦when a mile
or so out the men on her noticed the barge
taking a big list to port. A gust of wind
came, and without a moment's" warning
the vessel heeled over and dumped the
load Into the bay. In a few minutes over
$900 worth of good planking was going out
rapidly with the tide. The waterlogged
barge was then anchored and an attempt
made to gather up the lumber, but it fail
ed. Stone now holds the owner of the
launch responsible for the accident, while
the launch people assert the cause of the
whole- trouble was the overloading of a
leaky boat.
Barge of Lumber Lost.

NEW. YORK, Aug. ll.-One of the most
sensational bicycle races of the year was
witnessed at Vailsburg to-day between
H. E. 1 Bleeker and John T. Colgan It
was an Australian pursuit race. Tom But
ler and Caldwell, the other starters fell
by the wayside early. Bleeker and Colgan
were about even and struggled on in a
gruelling race mile after mile. - The spec
tators cheered wildly at first, but later
the wan faces of the racers showed that
they were on the verge of collapse. The
referee urged them to call it a draw, but
they either did not hear him or declined.
Then the referee ordered another rider to
mount his wheel and give chase, suggest
ing to each racer that he stop, and call it
a draw. The rider caught Bleeker and
Bleeker agreed. to the proposition. Before
the rider could catch up with Colgan the
latter fell exhausted and had to be carried
from the track. The referee could do
nothing but give the race to Bleeker, who
could scarcely stand when he dismounted
from his wheel.

HE four-masted British ship Ach-
I neshie goes to Martinez this morn-
E ing to lay up until the strike is
ii. over. She came here from Tal
cuhano in ballast and looked as
pretty as a picture as she made port. Cap
tain Longmuir, master of the Achneshie,
says the name Is pure Gaelic and means
the home or house of peace. The stout
ship deserves it, as there has never been
a row aboard, and the entire crew has re
mained by the vessel in spite of every
thing.
Captain Longmuir has been coming to
San Francisco since 1860. He was last here
three years ago in the Glenflnart. On his
return to England- he became superin
tendent of the Glen line and held the po
sition until the fleet was sold to foreign
buyers. Then CaDtain Pasifull of the
jxonneshie retired and the command was
offered to Captain Longmuir and accepted.
Frfâ Glasgow the Achneshie went to
Vancouver, B. C. and then back to Liver
pool. From Liverpool she went to Car
diff and loaded coal for South America,
and, after discharging at Talcuhano, came
to San Francisco in ballast. She Is one
of the best found ships in. the bay and
and a good sailer.
Joe Shay, a newsboy, fell overboard
from Main-street- wharf and was nearly
drowned yesterday. He was rescued and
taken to the Harbor Hospital, where he
gpadually recovered.
Port Costa yesterday, where she -will lay
up until the strike is over.
The City of. Peking, from the Orient, was

She was a day late leaving Yokohama
and had not reached Honolulu when the

The Star Kennels' cleved young courser
Game Boy won the open stake yesterday
at Union Park, beating Chiarini Bros.'
Dewdrop for final honors. The stake was
an interesting one and brought out many
good trials. The performers proved an
excellent lot and with few exceptions did
all that was expected of them. Bridget
Cleary, a litter sister of Sacramento Boy,
showed herself a good short end in the
early morning and by her cleverness took
a close race from Bona Fide. The talent
made McComb's entry the favorite, but in
setting the odds let their poor judgment
run away with their money. Fifteen to
one was offered and taken. Bona Fide Is
an inconsistent courser and at times will
lose the flag to a cripple. Coupled with
the fact that her opponent Is a clever one,
the wise ones at least erred in giving such
odds.- Bridget won the course strictly on
merit, leading to the hare for the first
turn and running up four points before
allowing Bona .Fide to score.
The knowing ones were given a severe
shock In the go between Rector and Far
away. Rector was looked upon as a strong
candidate for the stake and in this course
was made choice at 1 to 10 and even 1 to
11. He led two lengths, but Faraway,
when e-nce In possession, kept him away
and scored eight points to his six. Palo
Alto met Luxor in the fifth and. leading
as he pleased, made that top-notch cours
er look like a plater. In the next course
and as a 5 to 2 favorite he was led and
beaten by Dewdrop.
For Freedom ran in good form and beat
Candelaria and King Cotton easily. Fly
ing Fox reached the fifth round, where he
retired in favor of the youngster Game
Boy. Sir Pasha, and Luxor ran well.
In the deciding course Dewdrop led to
the hare for the first turn, Game Boy
scoring three turns and the kill. Dewdrop
was the choice, but Game Boy money was
not lacking at 3 to 6.
The match race between Tralee Boy and
Tame Tralee was won by the Boy by a
score of 10 to 2. In the run up the field a
blanket could have covered both dogs. The
Boy just took the turn and worked his
game so cleverly that he kept his sister
from joining in.
Freeze Out won the puppy stake easily,
which made a double victory for the get
of For Freedom.

The Battalion cf Artillery, National
Guard of California, held Its first annual
State shoot at Shell Mound yesterday.
Every battery was represented by a large
number of marksmen, and the results of
the shooting are viewed with great sat
isfaction by the leading spirits of the new
organization. The contestants were all
dressed in uniform and marched to the
ranges in a body.
The shooting was at 200. 300 and 500
yards. Lieutenant \7. S. Grattan was in
charge of the shoot, .' nd was assisted by
a large number of his brother officers. So
many were in attendance that not all
were able to shoot on all three targets
before nightfall, and tnese scores will be
completed at a~oÂ«h r- time.
The other organizations which held reg
ular con'cts :esterday were Independent
Rifles, Norddeutschti Schuetzen Club,
Golden Gate F 3*Â« Â»nl Pistol Club, Ger
maaia Schue*~Ln Club, San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein and Swiss Rifle Club.
The day's scores are as follows:
Sir Thomas says that the Shamrock II Is
nine minutes faster than the Shamrock I
now, and that the Shamrock I Is five to
ten minutes faster than when she was in
American waters. Sir Thomas has invited
the - Oxford-Cambridge athletic team,
which is to compete in Canada and the
United States, to witness the races from
on board the Erin. The Oxford and Cam
bridge athletes will sail Thursday on the
steamer Commonwealth for Boston. They
will stay a day In that city and will then
go to Montreal.
LONDON. Aug. 1Lâ King Edward sent
for Sir Thomas Upton last week and
made frequent Inquiries regarding the
form of the Shamrock II. His Majesty
wished her good luck.
certain Prom Him the Form of
the Yacht.

KUTG EDWAED WISHES
STTATVTROCK H GOOD LTJCK
The yachting sharps aboard the tugs
had no opportunity to-night to size up
the latest aspirant for the honor of lift-
Ing the cup. She lay simply a thin black
smudge on the dark waters, looking
strange with her stunted jurymast and
queer sloop rig, with her jib and forestays
carried inboard. She carries the jurymast
of the old Shamrock, but her topmast
Is fifteen feet shorter, so that the' dis
tnace from deck to truck is probably not
over ninety feet. She will be towed m
to-morrow by the tug Robert Hadden,
the first tug to speak her, under Instruc
tions from Sir Thomas before she left to
accept the first tow offered. After pass
ing quarantine she will be towed to the
man-of-war anchorage off Tompklnsvllle.
and later to the Erie basin, where she
will be stripped and her masts stepped
preparatory to going into the drydock.
Captain Matthews' first inquiry after
the greeting was of the challenger's op
ponent, the Constitution, and when he
learned that she had beaten the Columbia
on Saturday, he expressed hi3 pleasure
and then regret when he was informed
of the Columbia's accident in the race.
Greetings on both sides were hearty,
but beyond saying that the yacht had en
countered fine weather, neither Captain
Matthews of the Erin nor Captain Syca
more of the challenges would give details
of the trip. That they regarded It as a
fine performance was evident from Cap
tain Matthews' ejaculation of surprise
when informed that the tugs had been on
the lookout for her for two days. "Give
her a chance," he shouted. As a matter
of fact, the Shamrock II' s time la less
than fourteen days, counting her stop of
one day at St. Michaels. Azores, a day
better than the time of the old Sham
rock, which was far and away better than
that of any former challenger.
SANDY HOOK. Aug. 11.â Shamrock II,
Sir Thomas Upton's second challenger
for America's cup, in tow of her con
scrt, the big steam yacht Erin, arrived off
Saidy Hook lightship shortly after 11
o'clock to-night and anchored for th3
night just Inside the lightship half an
hour later, w A newspaper tug and the
tugboat James R. Lawrence, with David
Barrie, Sir Thomas' personal representa
tive in thl3 country, aboard had been
cruising off Sandy Hook for two day3
awaiting the appearance of the foreign
cup-hunter. When off the lightship the
Krin burned her Coston signala and the
tugs ran alongside.

MORNING GAME.
, Nordyke started the music with a
mighty sound by putting the ball over the
center field fence for four bases, and his
good lead was followed up in the succeed-,
ing inning, which added five more to the
score. Sullivan managed to get a two
bagger, but the next two men were easy
outs. It looked like . nothing doing until
Hlldebrand rolled an easy one to Court
ney, who fumbled it, sending Sullivan
home and placing "Hildy" safe. With the
aid of hits bj- Pabst. Krug and Nordyke
four more Germans bounded to the home
station and cinched the game.
Two more were made, one In each suc
ceeding Inning, by means of two hits, er
rors and a wild pitch by Hoffer. The
Wasps failed to score from the fifth in
ning on. due chiefly to their inability to
hit Hoffer.
Sacramento simply could not hit Evans,
and the gilt-edge support which he re
ceived also aided in keeping the Senators
away from the rubber. Not a single one
pf them reached third base, and the sec
ond cushion Â¦was a coveted place.
Hanlon was back in his old position and
showed up well in the field. The locals
played a good game a 1 around, every man
distinguishing himself.
The crowd was the largest since opening
day and it acted in a good-natured man
ner, applauding each good play, but In
dulging in very little hooting. The score:

Evans was again in great form and al
lowed his opponents but three scattered
hits, two being made by McLaughlin. His
support was faultless, and to this may be
attributed the overwhelming victory. Hof
fer's support was very ragged at times,
Courtney alone being responsible for five
points.
Hoffer, the ex-Baltimore wonder, failed
to impress the locals with his twirling
ability, for they landed on him for eight
clean hits, a bunch of four in the third
round netting five runs. But when he
settled down he pitched good ball, and
throughout the game fielded his position
in exceptionally good form.
Uncle Henry Harris was on hand yes
terday afternoon, and his presence infused
a large quantity of ginger and hitting
ability Into his wayward proteges. They
hit and caught and threw everything
which came, their way, and before the
umpire called the last man out Uncle
Hank wore a broad grin, for his men had
taken a hard fall out of the Sacramento
stick-wielders, and though they lost the
series they were at least saved from
worse results.

TACOMA, Aug. 11.â The body of C.
Link of Chicago, >aged 50 years, was found
on the beach eight miles from Port An
geles last Friday. He had either commit
ted suicide or been murdered, circum
stances pointing strongly toward murder
His right hand grasped a revolver which
contained four cartridges, with one ex
ploded. His body was twice penetrated
by bullets. One entered his' left breast
and lodged in the back, while the other
entered his right temple. It is believed
that he was killed for the purpose of rob
bery and that the weapon was placed in
his hand to avert suspicion.
When he left Victoria last Sunday Link
had ?675 in cash and two of his pockets
were full of letters and papers. These
had disappeared, his pockets containing
only 50 cents. On Wednesday he ex
pressed a package to C. R. Linde in Chi

identity and purpose more fully.

it is not believed that the drain will be
sufficient to raise London rates material
ly. The week witnessed the unusual spec
tacle of an improvement in home rails
and a decline in Americans. This arose
on one hand from renewed apprehension
regarding the steel strike, while on the i
other the fact that railroad sha.res de
scended to about the lowest possible fig
ures was due to reaction. The outlook for
home traffic is exceedingly gloomy. The
half-yearly statements of the railway
companies are all in. and they ehow a
serious falling off in the gross receipts
In almost even- case, while the tremen
dously increased working cost materially
reduces dividends. The managers confess
that they see no prospect of improvement
for years ahead, and there is a general
err for retrenchment. There is a wide
field for improvement in the equipment
of both freight and passenger depart
ments, and this fact, combined with the
present low price of stocks, seems to offc
a favorable opening for American enter
prise to do for the steam roads what it
is already doing for the tramway lines
So far as the steel strike is concerned
there Is wide divergence of opinion with
reference to the relative strength of the
men and the employers. There is also a
plentiful supply of misinformation as to
the American labor situation in general
The only unanimity of belief Is in the
conviction that the strike is certain to
have a disastrous effect upon industrial
Interests. Consequently .the outlook for
business In the American section of the
Stor-k Exchange is not promising.

The pedestrians who were abroad in the

a startling episode. An injured wife
wreaked vengeance there on a recreant
husband and his lady friend, whom he
had taken to the theater. The wife had
the assistance of a stalwart brother, who
proceeded to make things interesting for
the husband, while the wife took care of
the lady friend. For a while hair and
complexion powder were at a discount in
the neighborhood. AH' of the principals
were finely dressed and gave evidence of
respectability.
The affray attracted an immense crowd,
many of whom took sides and cheered
the interested parties on to battle. Most
of the audience took the side of the In
jured wife and encouraged he:- to assert
her marital rights, which she did not hes
itate to do in a most hearty manner. She
was finally led awny by her brother after
she had succeeded in almost completely
wrecking her victim's .dress and extract-
Ing a quantity of glossy tresses. \The at
Â¦'c parties immediately left j
of battle and went away from the ap
plauding crowd.
The husband remained loyally by his
companion and the two wended their way
up O'Farrell street, followed by a great
portion of the crowd. They requested Of

two went into an O'Farrell street saloon,

OAKLAND, Aug. 11.â An Oakland
girl and a graduate of the Uni

first honors in this year's examin
ation at Sarbonne, the great
center of learning in France. She is prob
ably the first of her sex to hold that dis
tinction since the founding of the uni
versity during mediaeval days. It is not
common for a woman to enter Sarbonne,
but for one to carry off first honors over
the world's students is something re
markable. Indeed, and something of which
womankind may well be proud.
The young lady who nas brought fame
and distinction to herself and honor to
her university is Lucy Ware "Williams, a
graduate of the class of 1897. Miss Wil
liams entered college with ,the class of
1896. but as she remained out a year she
did not graduate until 1897. On graduation
she received the degree of Bachelor of
Philosophy. She was a student of marked
ability and showed great promise for
future work. She has been studying in
Paris for three years, holding during that
time, a Phebe A. Hearst scholarship.
Miss Williams came from Natlorcnl
City, where her parents are residing.
While here her bright and cheerful dispo
sition brought many more friends into her
life than is usually allotted the close stu
dent and deep thinker. She was a gen
eral favorite at college.

WIN AT SAN RAFAEL
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 11.â Rumor,
almost always busy with Minister qf
Finance M. Witte, has set afloat various
stories of ill health to account for his de
ferring his proposed journey to Manchu
ria in order to take a course at Wiesba
den. Most Ministers naturally prefer
Wiesbaden to Manchuria as a cure to un
remitting labor during the hot summer
months. Not. so with M. Witte, who Is a
sort of Atlas in the Russian, world, and
has one of those natures which are alike
greedy of work and unwilling to drop even
for a spell the reins of power. The most
persistent report is that the Minister is
threatened with meningitis. The truth
seems to be thatJhe has undergone un
usual strain during the last twelve months
and is in need of a thorough rest. If cer
tain people, "who often know what Is be
ing talked of In court circles are not in
error, he will have the satisfaction next
Â¦winter of seeing Mme. Witte received at
court. It is said that the young Empress
has taken quite a fancy to Mme. Witte.

Russian Official Threatened With
MINISTER OF FINANCE â
WITTE'S FALLING HEALTH
Mrs. Lipari openly announced that she
was going away with, Leffen, and she
said that it would be useless to follow
them. Mrs. Leffen says she pleaded with
the -woman to cease her endeavors to
win the affections of her husband, but
her pleadings were laughed at, and the
woman boasted of her influence over her
sister's husband.
Mrs. Leffen says that for nearly a year
her 'husband has been under the influ
ence of her sister, Mrs. â¢ Myra Lipari,
who secured a divorce from her husband
scarcely a. year ago. Last Thursday Lef
fen went to his home, packed the be
longings of Mrs. Lipari and his . own
clothes In a trunk, end after telling his
wife that he was going to leave her for

Since then nothing has been seen or

SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 11.â Will A.
Leffen of this city Is charged with hav
ing deserted his wife and four-weeks
old child and left for parts unknown
with his wife's sister. The story is told
by the man's wife, who, with tears in
her eyes, said to-day:
"He kissed the baby, bade me goo3
by and said he would never see me
again. Then he went away with my sis
ter, but where he went I do not know."

It is very generally believed here that
the withdrawal of the Colombian Minis
ter from Caracas marks the beginning of
Â¦what will eventually become an open
rupture between the two Governments,
which may lead to war if peace cannot
be preserved through the good offices of
the United States.
\\ hen seen to-night he was at a loss
to understand the significance of the In
tended departure of the Colombian Min
ister from Caracas. He called attention
to the fact that the cablegram Bays spe
cifically that no passports were given to
the Minister, from which It would seem
that his departure did not Indicate a for
mal breaking off of diplomatic relations.
Had Venezuela dismissed the Minister
his passports would have been sent to
him. and had Colombia recalled him with
the Intention of severing relations he
would. In accordance with diplomatic
usage, have demanded his passports.
It Is known In Washington that the Co
lombian Government Is fully satisfied not
only that Colombian Insurgents are re
ceiving assistance from the Venezuelan
side cf the border with the connivance
of local officials, but also that President
Castro of Venezuela is secretly support
ing them. For this reason the feeling In
Colombia against Venezuela, and espe
cially against President Castro, is very
intense.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET N
V,\. WASHINGTON, Aug. ll.-Senor Her
ran. charge d'affaires of Colombia In
Washington, has received no confirmation
from his Government of the Information
contained In a cable dispatch from Car
acas that the Colombian Minister to
Venezuela wou.d leave to-morrow and
turn over his legation to Mr. Russell, the
American charge c* 'affaires. The last dis
patch received by Senor Herran was
dated July 27, and he attributed his fail
ure to receive later Information to the
interruption of communication by a
break, in the cable line running to Co
lombia,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Passengers on the Great Northern over
land train, which arrived last night two
hours late, report that the greatest forest
fire known for years is raging in the
mountains just west of Wellington on
both sides of the track. Several bridges
have caught fire, but the company's fire
engines have so far been able to protect
all railway property.
When the overland train passed through
the burning forest many of the passen
gers were overcome by fright and several
women fainted. The smoke and heat was
almost Intolerable, and the train raced
with the leaping flames until safety was
assured. The train men report that the
fire Is the worst seen In the Cascades
since 1S%. All trains have been delayed.
A tremendous fire is reported to be
burning between Woodinville and Grace,
and some fear is expressed for the farm
dwellings and barns in the vicinity. Fires
are causing much damage In heavy tim
ber about Shelton. in Mason County, and
also in Chehalis County.
TACOMA. Aug. ll.-Forest fires are rag
ing between Lake Samamish and the
Snoqualmle River, and many lumber
camps are In danger. Haley's camp, on
the Snoqualmie, was yesterday saved only
by the strenuous efforts of fifty men.
Many thousands of dollars worth of tim
ber has already been destroyed, and lum
bermen say unless it rains soon more
damage is Inevitable.

SALT LAKE, Utah. Aug. 11.â Every
thing points to a successful meeting of the
National Society. Army of the Philippine*,
which will hold its second annual encamo
ment and reunion in this city August 13,
14 and 15. It will be the first great gather
ing of army men in Salt Lake and -wi!l
bring together soldiers of rank and fila
from every quarter of the Union. Fully
2000 veterans of the Spanish and Phi'.io
pine wars are expected to attend the re
union, and elaborate arrangements have
been made for their entertainment.
At the Inquest to-day a report was
made by a chemist, Frank T. Green of
San Francisco, which stated that he had
been unable to find any traces of poison
in the stomach. The jury, however, paid
no attention to this evidence, and re
t-irned a verdict that Mrs. Thomas came
to her death "from poison administered
by some one to this jury unknown."
A month before her death Mrs. Thoma3
had her life insured in a fraternal order
for $1000. District Attorney Campbell
took part in the inquest to-day, and will
continue his investigations further.
Mrs. Thomas, the wife of T. J. Thomas,
a wood and coal dealer, was taken sud
denly ill on Wednesday morning, and two
hours later died. Her dea^h was pre
ceded by spasms, and there were indica
tions eof strychnine poisoning. Near her
was found a bottle that had contained
ergot, and her husband and Sirs. Mary
Wilson, a friend, testified that Mrs.
Thomas was in the habit of using the
drug.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 11.â The mystery sur
rounding the sudden death of Mrs. Mar
garet Thomas, which occurred Wednes
day morning, has not been solved- by the
Coroner's inquest. Instead, the jury has
added a more sensational color to the mat
ter, and the verdict to-day casts suspi
cion of murder upon some person who
probably was connected with her. The 'in
quiry into her ueath has beer. , most
searching and exhaustive, and the Ques
tion considered was whether it was a
case of murder or suicide.

to Rob Mistress of
/ Jewels.
Claims Gardelli Forced Her
Julia j Gonzalesky, who was sentenced
Saturday to. 'two" days imprisonment in
the House of Correction for stealing a
lot of jewelry from her mistress, tells a
sensational story of how she "was forced
to part . with her luxuriant tresses and
! don i male attire by Frank â¢ Gardelli, her
accomplice in crime in order to deceive
the police.
Gardelli is now undergoing a sentence
of eight years for complicity in the bold
theft. According to the woman's story
she first met Gardelli in Buenos Ayres.
He promised to make her his wife and
induced ".her 'to elope with him to New
York. She had 300 florins \ with her,, and
after I reaching New 1 York he compelled
her to give the money to^him. After re
maining there a short time Gardelli and
the woman, :who is a beautiful brunette,
came to this city and took a room, in a
cheap lodging-house on .Pacific street.
Finding himself short of money Gar
delli . ordered his companion to insert an
advertisement in one of the newspapers
seeking employment as a domestic. Mrs.
Bspinoza of 2400 Harrison street answered
the advertisement, and after a brief i con
v^rsation,with Julia she employed her.
Miss Gonzalesky' s story of the robbery
and subsequent events, as told to Dis
trict Attorney Byington, is as follows:
Threatened to Kill Eer.
"The first day I worked for.Mrs.Es*
pinoza Gardelli sent for me and inquired
if my mistress had any jewelry. I told
him she had a large 'number of diamonds
which she had purchased in Central
America. He told me to steal them, and
when I refused he threatened to kill me
unless I obeyed. He took out his re
volver, and polnting.it at my head, told
me. to go and bring 'him the stones.
Fearing for my life I tremblingly, re
turned to the house and took the
diamonds during the temporary absence
o.f my , mistress. Gardelli was % waiting
outside for me, and as I passed him the
jewel case containing the stones he com
manded me to follow him.
"We walked along the Mission road un
til we came to a body of water, which I
have since told me is .Lake Merced.
As it was quite dark he decided that it
would be useless for us to proceed any
further for 'the time being and we slept
in the brush until morning. I wanted to
return to the city,- but he would not al
low me to. Thinking that I might 'be
recognized while trudging along the road
he forced me to submit to having my hair
cut off by- him. He had an extra suit of
clothes with him and t>y threatening to
shoot me he compelled me to don them.
Resumes Ffcmale Attire.
"From Lake Merced we walked to San
Mateo, where we boarded a train for San
Jose. At the latter place he ordered me to
discard my. male attire for a cheap calico
dress which he had stolen from a con
venient clothesline while in San Mateo.
"From San Jose- we went to Los An
geles, where we were recognized and ar
rested. I am glad that he has been given
a long term in prison, as I can have a
chance to. return to my parents and lead
a respectable life."
Satisfied of the truth of her story, Judge
Cook mercifully sentenced Julia to only
two days' imprisonment in the House of
Correction. After her release this.morn
ing several persons who have been
touched by her pitiful story intend to
provide for her until she hears from her
parents. -
ASTONISHHTG STATEMENT
CONCERNING THE CADILLAC
Judges Say the Yacht May Increase
the Base of. Its Foretriangular
Over Four Feet.
CHICAGO, Auk. 11.â The judges of the
international yacht race for the Canada's
cup to-night gave, out the astonishing an
nouncement that the Cadillac, the defend
er., may increase the base of its fore
triangular 4.35 feet. This is a correction
with a vengeance, and means that the
Cadillac can carry out its bowsprit four
feet and four inrhes. thereby increasing
the area of its jib by about 100 square
feet, and can increase the iength of its
spinnaker boom by four feet four inches,
and consequently can set a much larger
spinnaker.
The announcement has caused much
criticism, particular as it comes after one
race has been sailed. /
It had been known all day that some
Â¦wrangling over the measurements had
been going on. One explanation is that
the measurer made a bip blunder. What
the real reason" is the officials refuse to
say. . -. .

While Colonel Hooper had been In failing
health for several years, his condition at

his death was heart disease. Had he

was present when the end came.
Colonel Hooper was born in Virginia

Â¦ ANSWERS CALL OF DEATH
Lieutenant and Mrs. Blue will remain
in San Francisco several days before leav
ing for the East.
"It bothered me at first," eaid the lieu
tenant. "I found myself, after a few
months' residence at Cavite, almost to
tally unable to recollect names of people.
In every â¢ other respect my memory, al
ways good, remained true to me. Then I
found my 'Wife worrying about a similar
lapse on her part. : On the transport I
found about a dozen in a similar fix.
"When my brother met me this afternoon
It was only when I heard somebody say
'that's Rupert Blue, he used to be quar
antine . officer,' that I remembered his
name. 'Phllippinitls* we call it now, and
I recommend a course of mental gymnas
tics for the development of the name de
partment of the brain to all white folks
contemplating an. extended stay in the
tropics."
Lieutenant Blue speaks in glowing
terms of the success of the naval train-
Ing station at Cavite, where, under the
supervision of Lieutenant Knapp, the
younger generation of Filipinos is being
prepared for the merchant marine. Â¦
The navy, too, Is drawing on Uncle
Sam's new wards. Shortly before Blue
left for home the work of enlisting five
hundred natives for service on the gun
boats stationed in the Philippines was pro
gressing briskly.
"They are born sailormen," he said,
"and we should get lots of good material
from the islands for service in those
waters."
"Philipplnitis" is the latest disease to
which white folks in the Philippines are
falling prey. As he found ' the Spanish
fleet, so it was Lieutenant Blue who dis
covered and named this most inconveni
ent malady. \ /
Lieutenant Blue graduated from the Na
val Academy in September, 18S3, and long
before the Santiago affair had gained
among his shipmates a reputation for in
trepidity and unswerving devotion to duty.
He was ordered to the Asiatic station In
the early part of 1900 and has since served
as Admiral Kempff 's flag lieutenant.
Things are settling down nicely In the
Philippines," he said last evening, "and
the natives, especially those in the neigh
borhood of Manila are beginning to real
ize the material benefits to them, of the
new order of affairs."
All alone and In uniform Blue landed on
June 11 on the Cuban shore. With a Cu
ban guide he penetrated the Spanish lines
ana gained a point three miles away and
in full view of the Spanish fleet. He made
a map of the harbor and the location of
the ships, retraced his steps and, after a
journey of seventy miles, every step of
which w,as fraught with peril, ne report
ed the result of his observations to Ad
miral Sampson. He repeated the journey
on June 25 for the purpose of gaining fur
ther : information.
Of all the heroes of the late war with
Spain there is none that made a better
record than Blue and none that wears his
hard-won honors more modestly. It was
Victor Blue who was selected by Admiral
Sampson for the perilous task of locating
dennitely the Spanish fleet in Santiago
harbor. This he did, and more, and from
June 11 until the day of the famous battle
the name of Blue figured prominently In
the dispatches.
Lieutenant Victor Blue of the navy, re
cently detached from the staff of Admiral
Kempff ,. was among the passengers who
arrived yesterday on the army transport
Sumner. He was accompanied by his wife.
Lieutenant Blue's term of sea service hav
ing expired some time ago, he is home to

An Accident After the Woodmen's In-

IN THE COMPETITIVE DBILL
Instead of being the victim of footpadr,
it has been learned that Lewis Morrison
was run over by a buggy last Thursday
night and that his frightful injuries about
the face and head were inflicted by the
hoofs of the horse and'the impact of tue
buggy, and not by; the blows of assail
ants. - â¢ , - . ;
The veteran actor appeared at the dress
ing room of his wife, -Florence Roberta,
at the Alcazar Theater, . late Thursday
night, dazed and bleeding from wounds
in his face. He said he had been attacked
by footpads at Van Ness avenue and Ellis
street, had fought them and had been
beaten cruelly by them. ,.His account of
his mishap was published 'in The Call, and
Friday night a young man called at the
Morrison home, 922 Ellis street, and asked
for Mr. Morrison. Mrs. Morrison's mother,
Mrs. Thompson, said that he could not
be seen. The visitor said he had come to
explain that the actor had been' run over,
and not beaten by footpads, i
The young man's story was that he was
walking along Van Ness avenue when a
man in a buggy called to him and said he
had run over a man and wanted assist
ance. The two, after quieting the horse,
which was fractious, tried to get trie
injured man. into the, buggy, in order to
take him to Â¦ a hospital, but he did not
understand what they were saying and he
struggled savagely and finally broke away
and ran down Ellis street.
The visitor felt sure that Mr. Morrison
is the man who was run over, and Miss
Roberts Is convinced of the truth of his
story- Mr. v Morrison, it is believed, whs
so dazed by his injuries that he thought
he had been knocked down and beaten by
the men who were trying to help him.
Mr. Morrison's condition Is greatly im
proved, and his physician says his re
covery will be rapid. ' . ,
