, Upon the receipt of . this . letter I asked " that
a 'Â¦ meeting of . the â¢ directors of- the Employers' -
Assbctation* be' called,". in order.' that* It might
be "considered. 'â¢ After '. a ' long conference with'
that ; body I , find this to be the " situation :
'\ The employers â¢ say' that all the 'points .in-,
%-olved 'were' fully ' covered -^ln 5 Mr. Â¦-. Michael's
letter of .' July" 29 and . my accompanying state-'
ment," published in the press of July 30, and. by
which the' employers say they will stand and
hive so 'written, me this "evening.
Â¦.''-' Again, : : as"" to the federation's letter, ' the em
ployers .sayl that 1 they, ., as _ sreviously; stated,
shall "not discriminate against any 'employer of
labor ., because "such employer chooses \ to ; em
ploy' union men only, 1 nor will they discriminate
'against any; employe; because 'he chooses to* be
a â¢member, of ; a .labor ' organlzatloi ..
i The I association (.will - recommend K to the. em-'
ployers '. to '; reinstate ", their ; men * now , out," Â¦:', and
believes ' .that nearly : all men ; will be . , taken
back; Â¦ but,' . as â¢ in . the case Â¦ of .' the , teamsters.
some permanent men have been employed who
cannot now be Â¦ dismissed, bavins been prom
ised .work at regular Â¦wages if they choose' to
remain after the strike. The difficulties in this
respect, the employers say, are growing every
day and the sooner the men decide to so back
the more men will get their old employment.
They can go back when they on their part
agree, .In addition to obeying orders and sub
mitting grievances to their employers, promise
not" to attempt to coerce employes to join
unions . or employers to unionize, their places
of business. Â¦
Â¦- The employers say If, these things are done
In good faith there need be no farther trouble. Â¦
The only substantial difference between the
two sides now is as to the restoration of the
men to employment. As the great majority
of them can go back without question the in
terests at stake demand on the part of the
leaders a quick solution of the difficulties.
: The Employers'; Association , does not deal v
directly with w such questions.' but It w!H. the
directors say, recommend," for, instance, to the
Draymen's .Association to take. back its men.
It was intimated at' the meeting by a director
that the Draymen's Association could possibly
take back all except ten or twelve. Certainly
a little matter; like this should not keep men'
apart.' ' Even if the ten . or twelve were asked
to sacrifice themselves . for peace. the Brother
hood of Teamsters could take care of them In
some other ,way and ultimately It would no
doubt be- made right. /
I hope -this solution will be accepted and so
end the lockout and sympathetic strike, which,
Is doing great injury to city and State. The.
wheat crop cannot be shipped; manufacturing
plants * have difficulty In getting fuel; our
steamer fleet has been in part ' ordered by
wire to go to northern. ports; building opera
tions will be suspended for lack of material and
the building trades will suffer correspondingly
and so the other Industries. . The tte-up can
be broken without bringing new men to town
by a settlement, and I think the two sides
are near . enough" to" come together and end
the strife. ; JAMES O. PHELAN.
THE City Front Federation ' issued
yesterday a new proposal as y a
basis for settlement of â¢ the ques
tions that led to the general strike
on the docks and in the adjoining
districts. It embodies In a. somewhat
modified form the propositions first ad
vanced by the labor leaders. Mayor
Phelan submitted it to the Employers 1
Association, but tangible results have not
been reached.
The second day of the strike passed al
most without sensational incident. -' The
strikers conducted themselves in the main
with dignity and self-control and the em
ployers who are struggling to keep busi
ness moving In spite of labor's disaffec
tions went about their tasks with cheer
fulness and forbearance. However.des
perate the situation, the strike has as yet
taken on but little of the bitterness and
desperations that often make reigns i of
terror of labor struggles.
The relative advantages of the sides in
the contest were not materially changed
during the day. -More. men..wÂ«re called
out, the Porters'., Packers' and ."Ware
housemen's Union and â¢ the Â¦ Sailors'
Union being particularly active .- in
reaching Â¦ additional men. â¢ *Â¦ More- than
a, hundred, additional porters walked
out In the wholesale district, and the de
sertion of posts on the docks and aboard
the Bhips was of hourly occurrence.
The sand teamsters, 600 strong, will quit
Â¦work this morning and Join the army of

that all differences ' now or heretofore - ex
iBtln-r between the parties hereto have been
adjusted < on the :- terms â set forth in this
agreement; and each ' party - hereto promises
and. agrees to ' its _ best endeavors to
greatest difficulty in having even the lim
ited supply of coal which they have on
hand delivered. They .can only get team
sters to work under police protection.
Some of the coal concerns have been re
stricted in their traffic to such an ex
tent that they may be said to have tem
porarily suspended business.
John Rosenfeld stated yesterday that
his firm .had but two weeks' supply on
hand, but that two colliers with 10,000 tons
each are on their way from British Co
lumbia. These vessels are scheduled to
arrive in about three days.
A leading coal merchant in speaking
yesterday of the threatened coal famine,
said: "About 4000 tons of coal are con
sumed each day by factories and private
parties in this city. At this rate the total
supply which is now on hand cannot pos
sibly last for more than ten days. Even
If colliers do arrive in port it will almost
be a hopeless task to secure teams 'to haul
the coal from the wharves. In nay opin
ion, a sufficient supply cannot possibly be
furnished to the , large factories. If the
tie-up is continued in operation for the
next ten days this city may look to seÂ©
all its factories closing . their doors and
their thousands . of employes, ,- men and
women, sent to their homes to await the
end of the strike. The city's commercial
and industrial interests will receive a
blow from which they will not recover for
years."
So strict and comprehensive is the tie
up on the water front that J. C. Wilson
& Co. had to secure a permit to supply
the transports at Mare Island, the light
houses and the pumping* stations and hos
pitals at the Presidio.. The same firm has
also asked permission to have its former
employes allowed to discharge 2500 tons of
coal from the Australia for the transport
Meade. .
Work Suspended on Colliers Now in Port and Vessels Will Be
. : Tied Up With Unavailable CargQes Aboard as Fast as They
Arrive, Unless Capital and Labor Adjust Their Difficulty
COAL SUPPLY IS NOT SUFFICIENT

STOCKTON, July 31.â The general tie-up
on the San Francisco water front has had
a somewhat depressing effect In business
circles in this city, some of the grocery

result in causing them considerable) diffi
culty in getting goods from -San Fran
cisco. The strike will not tie np the
steamer lines, as they will continue to
carry passengers and transport freight toÂ«
and from way stations. The up-freight v
business from the bay, however, is greatly
decreased, and the freight business gener
ally is greatly lessened by the strike.

QEORGE RENNER, .manager for
the Draymen's Association,
makes the following statement,
. giving- the history of the trouble
between the draymen and thÂ£
Brotherhood of Teamsters:
The draymen got along finely until September
27. 1S00. when the Brotherhood' of Teamsters
presented their demands to us, giving us until
October 1 to adopt or reject the same. Our
association immediately called a special meet
ing, and our side, in order to avoid trouble,
asked for a conference with the teamsters. At
this time the various drayage firms were in
consultation with the different merchants that
they haul for, and we told them that nearly all
our wants were much advanced in prices, j Iron
for. tire* on our vehicle3 advancing . from 1%
cents per pound to 3t4 cents per pound, hard
wood lumber from 8% cents per foot to 14V4
centa per foot, and that we could not grant this
raise of wages without raising the prices for
cartage. And I want to Bay right here for the
cretfit of the merchants, that there was not
one merchant on record that said fight. On the
contrary, they told* us to make the best terms
we could with the Brotherhood of Teamsters,
and. we will do what is right with the dray
men; . Our committee met the committee of the
brotherhood and came to an agreement, which
was to be in effect for one year, from October
1. 1900. under the terms of which the men se
cured the advanced pay and the pay for over
time demanded by them, and in fact nearly
everything they asked for. â¢
The first serious new rule that the Brother
hood oX ' Teamsters tried to enforce , was last
spring, when | they Issued a notice to their
drivers that they ehould not take care of horses
after 6 p. m. They even went so far in McNab
& Smith's stable to stop a driver by the name
of Kasmussen from washing a horse's sore
neck. We took this matter up with the brother
hood and it died its own death. Â¦Â¦
On or about March 25, 1901, I received a com
munication from, the brotherhood asking for a
conference, which was granted, and at the
meeting they presented new demands, notwith
standing their agreement to stand by the first
agreement for one year. Their second demands
were as follows: :. . . - #

being loaded with freight by the Filipino
and Chinese members of the crews of the
Indiana. Pennsylvania and Ohio who were
lately released from the transport ser
vice. . These vessels are all tied up and
their 'owners have transferred their crews
to the Conemaugh of the Empire Steam
ship- Company.
The Conemaugh is scheduled to sail for
Â¦ Cape Nome to-day, but her owners will
not be able to get her out before Friday
night. The day before the strike was or
dered the union longshoremen were en
gaged in coaling her, and only succeeded
in filling her bunkers a few hours before
the strike took place. Since then the own
ers have not been able to secure a crew
'of men to handle the immense amount of
freight that she ' was to carry to the
northern country. The crews of the ves
sels that had bÂ«en used as transports be
came available and they were put to
work. The Orientals made but poor prog
ress yesterday in the work of loading the
vessel, and at quitting time hundreds of
Ions .-of Â¦ freight littered the dock. - ~*
The . steamship Umatilla arrived from
the " sound yesterday. After she had
docked Captain Waliace came ashore and
{â¢pent several hours in hunting men to go
to work unloading her. He succeeded In
finding thirty-five . men and with these
commenced the task of emptying the hold
of his vessel. Captain Wallace says he
does not anticipate any difficulty in getting
his vessel ready to leave here at the ap
pointed time next Sunday morning. The
entire crew of the Umatilla* left the ves
sel a.short time after her arrival in port.
The big Kosmos liner Hermonthis is be
ing loaded at Cae seawall, while the Cur
acao and the Anubis of the same line are
lying idle. The crews of the last named
vessels are at work on the cargo for the
Hermonthis and as soon as they, finish
loading the big ship wiil be put to work
on the Curacao's stores. By this means
It is expected to prevent any delay In the
departure of any of the ships of . the
Kosmos line. * .
The steam schooner - Fulton came - into
port yesterday from Redondo. but did not
Crop anchor. The captain of the schooner,
Â». r hen abreast of Meiggs wharf, h? tied the
wharfinger and asked how matters stood
en the front. On being informed that the
situation ivas critical, he turned the bow
uf his vessel seaward and started imme
diately for one of the coast ports. .
The collier Bristol arrived yesterday from
Oyster Harbor. She is among the vessels
that are tied up. The Bristol has a big

! At the Spear-street dock, where the'Or

steamer Columbia was Deing loaded, one
of- tl.e . most' amusing- incidents of the"
strike was to be seen. The clerks em
ployed in- the uptown office and the men
who do the" clerical work on the dock, un-"
uer the orders of Deck Superintendent W.
\V. Blair, hustled flour and sugar and en
deavored to fill the immense holds of the
vessel. They displayed a very willing
-spirit, but their flesh was woefully weak.
.They were dressed in .brand new suits
of. blue overalls and for a time presented
a natty appearance, 'j.ney also wore their
fancy bosomed, stiffly starched linen
shirts, for a time, and for a very short
time kept their necks encased In the high
collars that work in the office enabled
them to wear. . They were also careful to
preserve the correctness of the crease in
their blue trousers, and frequently let go
of a box to adjust the "roll-up" at the
bottom.
Many of -the clerks were quite strong,
for a time, and hustled heavy boxes about
with true stevedore precision; but, like
their collars and fancy bosomed shirts,
they 6oon wilted. Blisters began to ap
pear on hands that had never lifted any
thing heavier than a pen, and in less than
two hours after they had tackled the job
of hustling freight they were a worn-out,
miserable looking lot. To add to their
misery, their friends began to take an
Interest In their doings and came from
every portion of the city to watch them.
They joshed the perspiring clerks from all
sides arid kept at it until the forlorn look
worn* by the amateur longshoremen
caused, them to quit. *

I ORIENTALS COME TO RESCUE,
TT T was an interesting day atr the head
11 quarters of the Porters'. Packers', and
I Warehousemen's* "Union ' yesterday.
If From the opening _of the office at 8
o'clock to the closing at "5 o'clock
there was a steady coming and going of
strikers, pickets and sympathizers.
, Before the close of the first day of the
' strike on Tuesday a total of Â£50 members
of the union on strike had registered their
names at headquarters and formally given
notice of their intention to stand by the
union through thick and thin. The iv-
Bponse to the order to strike, although
satisfactory, was not regarded to be. Just
â¢what it should have been, and a meeting
of the executive board was held, at which
a formal command upon all members of
the union to quit work immediately was
issued. This -order, duly sealed and coun
tersigned, was sent forth to the entire
membership of the union. The result was
apparent yesterday, when 300 men regis
tered "before the noon hour.
Robert Ldughery. business agent' of the
union, was a Dusy man during the whole
of the day. The report having been circu
lated that many members retused to quit
their employment, . he visited certain es
tablishments to talk to the employes. In
Â¦ nearly every instance he as well as the
pickets Of the union was denied admit
tance. In these_instances the telephone
was resorted to, the result being the ad
dition of nearly 100 to the ranks of the
porters and packers now on strike. ?
The first walkout of note to take place
' during the day was at the Arctic Oil
Works, corner of Illinois and Sixteenth
6treets. Ten union packers, yielding to
â¢ ice arguments of the pickets, deserted
their posts at 10 o'clock. During the
morning some forty men Â¦ connected with
I the foilowing firms went on strike: Wash
ington Manufacturing Company; II. J:
Brand enstein; Jones, Paddock & Co.;
Theobach, Kruger & Co., and Gulttard &
Co. In addition to these ten men of the
â¢Union Can Company and twelve of the
glass works at Harrison and Fifteenth
streets quit work at noon and registered
at headquarters.
All of the warehouses . -were closed yes
terday. They â¢were in charge of foremen,
but no business was transacted. These
Â¦ Induced the grain warehouses on seawall
Bfcction No. 2 and the Mission Bay grain
warehouses. Several of the Haslett ware
houses are still open, but the greater num
ber of employes having gone out little if
any business is being transacted.
President O'Neill of the union stated yes
terday that the entire membership would
be on strike to-day. He says that hun
dreds of the men are employed- by -the
' month and that yesterday being the lasi
day of July they preferred to work out
the full month before walking out. He
expressed the greatest confidence in the
outcome of the strike. That the . unions
would ultimately be recognized Â¦ by the
employers he did not doubt. The strikers,
he said, realized that everything depended
upon their Â¦ sticking together through the
present crisis, and they -were follow
ing the plan of strike as originally out
lined.
Officers of the ~ Union Successfully Resort to the Telephone
to Induce Hesitating Members to Surrender Their Positions.
Warehouses .Are Left .Deserted and t Little Business. Is Done
THE probability that the strike will
extend to the coast cities unless
a settlement of the local troubles
is speedily effected becomes
stronger and stronger. The vari
ous city-front labor organizations declare,
that the movement toward f. general
strike that Â¦will extend to the various port*
along the coast is inevitable should it
comÂ© to pass that the strikers in thiÂ« city
are unable to Trtn their tight without help
from abroad. * .
This eventuality is remote, however, in
asmuch as the City- Front" Federation is
convinced that the local organization will
be enabled to win with the help of the local
united labor organizations. At a meeting
of the federation last night the sentiment
was unanimous that the strike leaders are
fully able to cope with the situation and
that no serious trouble would be encoun
tered unless the employers steadily re
fused to come to an early agreement.
Should the desired settlement be unneces
sarily prolonged,, It is hinted that the
members of the allied unions will be
called out This would mean the calling:
out of nearly 10,000 additional men. The
federation will not take this step, it is
said, until the chance or settling the pres
ent difficulty no longer exists. Should
this step prove fruitless the strike may be
extended to other ports, thus effectually,
tieing up the coast shipping trade.
"The condition of affairs at tha present
time," said Andrew Furuseth, secretary
of the Sailors' Union, last night, "is more
promising than It has ever been with any
previous strike within my knowledge. We
have the situation well in hand and we
propose to maintain our supremacy. It
will be impossible for the ship-owners to
secure enough men to enable them to re
sume traffic to any appreciable extent.
Our reports are to the effect that in near
ly every instance Â¦where our men have been
allowed to talk to the non-union workmen
the latter Immediately quit work. Every
workman, be he a union man or not,
knows that this strike iÂ»* purely in his in
terests, and that success means much to
him. The result Is that the men rally
round our standard, so that we are en
couraged in the belief that we will win
the fight. Should our efforts to secure
an early settlement with the bosses fall
we will take steps which, ,we are holding
In reserve. We have no desire to make
threats, or any statement that might ap
pear to be of a threatening nature. Our
sole aim now is to bring this trouble to a
speedy termination, and that will be done
if the employers recognize our rights as
free American worklngmen. We are will-
Ing to allow matters to rest as they are
and all we ask is that the affair be
brought to a settlement without loss of
time. It is up to the employers now.
Let them do the proper thing and we will
go to work to-morrow morning."
At. the meeting of the federation a re
port was received amid applause to the
effect Â¦ that . the crew â¢ of the steamer*
Apache had struck during the evening be
cause they declined to work with a lot of
Chinese. -The Apache is a Sacramento
River boat and carried 700 tons of flour.
"When the crew was ordered to transship
the flour to a China steamer manned by
Chinese the Apache crew walked out to
a man. '.-..â¢- 1_ \
The action of the executive committee
in allowing coal contractors who are sup
plying Ithe Government lighthouses, hos
pitals and asylums with coal to deliver
their goods was approved. The require
ment was insisted upon that each coal
wagon should bear a card printed in large
type announcing that permission had been,
granted by the federation to deliver fuel.
"Reports from affiliated unions were re
ceived declaring the intention of those
bodies to stand by the federation to the
last extremity. Another meeting of the
federation will probably be held this even
ing.

EL RENO, O. T., July 31.â Commissioner
Richards' relieved many anxious question
ers to-day by saying tnat cash, meaning
currency or coin money, will not be neces
sary in the purchase of town lots at,La.w
ton, Anadarko Â¦ and Hobart. The' full
amount of each purchase must be paid to
the official conducting the sale at the time
the purchase Is made and the. collateral
offered must be approved and accepted by
the local banks on the ' townsite. Of
course, the sale will be turned down if the
banker rejects the collateral offered by
tha Durchaser and the lot will be offered
again for sale. This concession by Com
missioner Richards will be a great relief
to persons who believed that It would be
necessary to carry upon tneir persons the
money necessary for the purchase of lots.
Tin; danger ofv robbery would have been
gieat and it is possible that many persons
would . have been injured or killed in
hc!a-ups. Â¦ â¢Â¦

LONDON, July. 31.-4Iir the House- of.

olution granting Field Marshal

four, the" ' Government leader, in the
course of a eulogy of the field marshal,
said there was no doubt that but for Lord
Roberts' daring and strategy and the rap
idity with which his plans were carried
out, Kimberley ami Maf eking would have
fallen. 11,000 British "would have been
starv.ed into submission at Ladysmith and
there would have been a general rising
of disloyalists in South Africa. The coun
try was saved from this by the genius of
the man he now invited the House to re
ward by a unanimous vote, irrespective
of political differences. . v
The statement called forth protests from

From an American point of view, there
fore, it is desirable that the revolution
should succeed. No warship has been, or
dered to- Venezuelan" waters. The gun
boat Machias will be available for duty In
the Caribbean Sea next week, and she
may be sent to La Guayra. Her duty will
be limited to the protection of Americans
and' their interests, and she will under no
consideration give aid either to the revo
lutionists or to the Government.
Castro, the present President of Ven
ezuela, Inaugurated the revolt against the
Andrade Government In much the same
way as" the present revolutionists. .
Strained relations occurred
Venezuela and Colombia, and for a time
it looked as though war would take place.
Castro's successes, however, prevented a
hostile declaration against Colombia. It
is\no secret that the ' authorities here
would be â¢ gratified with 1 Castro's over
throw. His conduct with respect to the
asphalt controversy has been severely
criticized in "Washington. Some apprehen
sion has existed that when the court now
considering the asphalt dispute renders
its verdict Venezuela will decline to per
mit â¢ the United States to review the de
cision, as already demanded by Secretary
Hay. In this case the United States would
be compelled to take measures for pre
venting the ejection of the New York and
Bermudese Company from Felicidad
Lakes until It was satisfied of the justice
of the verdict of the court. It is apparent
that complications of a very serious na
ture.would arise/ .
Of great importance to this country may
.be the movement which has ' been inaug
urated. It may avert a. breach In the re
lations between the United States j and
Venezuela, threatened 'by the asphalt
question, and may result in' the settlement
of that iiuestion to the satisfaction ot this
Government. â¢ Conditions prevailing in
Venezuela had Indicated to the authorities
that a revolution is imminent, and- they
were not" surprised,, therefore, when 'they
received Mr. - Russell's message. ""This
statement concerning the contents of -his
cablegram was made v pubilc by Acting
Secretary Adee; â¢ - .
. "The Btate Department to-day received
the following: telegram from the American.
Legation - at Caracas: 'Martial law I has
been declared in Venezuela by. the Presi
dent of the country in consequence of the
invasion of ; a revolutionary . force from
Colombia. It is reported that : an army ot
10,000 men will meet the invaders.' ." . ; -
Â¦It is presumed at the department that
the invading army is not composed of

As this is a quotation of Admiral
Schley's "own -words, undoubtedly it will
be entirely satisfactory to him. Captain
James Parker, of counsel for Admiral
Schley. was again at the Navy Depart
ment to-day, making a careful examina
tion of the log books of all vessels which
participated in the Santiago campaign,
and of all dispatches sent to and by the

pating in the campaign. Admiral Crown

CALrli BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON. July 31.-In compli
ance with the request of Admiral Schley.
the Navy Department will modify the
fifth specification of the precept appoint
ing the court of inquiry to Investigate
his conduct during the Santiago cam
paign. Admiral Schley's acknowledg
ment of the receipt of the precept reached
the department on Monday, but the naval
authorities admit only to-day that they
had it in their possession. The text of
thÂ» letter the department declined to
make public, but It Is known that the ad
miral objects to the direction for an in
vestigation Into the "circumstances at
tending and reasons for disobedience by
Commodore Schley of orders contained in
Its dispatch dated May 25, 1S98, and tho
propriety of his conduct in the premises."
Admiral Schley contended that there wa3
a great difference between "disobedience
of orders" and "cannot obey orders," the
latter being the phrase he used in his
dispatch in answer to Instructions from
the department. A consultation of Web
ster's dictionary established that the
meaning of "disobedience" is "neglect"
as well as "refusal" to obey, and the de
partment holds consequently that tech
nically it was Justified in inserting the
â¢word "disobedience" in the precept. At
the fame time, there Is no Intention of
influencing in advance the Judgment of
the court and it is the desire of Secretary
Long that Admiral Schley shall be treated
with the utmost fairness. So, Mr. Hack
ett. Assistant Secretary of the Navy, who
â¢will return to Washington to-morrow, will
as acting Secretary send a letter to Rear
Admiral Schley, informing him that the
department is prepared to make the
change in the precept which he desires.
It is, of course, impossible to give tho
exact language in which the specification
Â¦will be written, but there is every reason
to believe that it will be about as fol
lows:
Special Dispatch to The Coll.
Confidence was felt in some circles to
day that the strike would eventually be
settled on the propositions made by Mor
gan. The officials of the steel companies
who have been acting for the United
States Steel Corporation in this matter
were apparently hopeful and light
hearted.
Another hour was spent in the confer
ence room and then the -meeting ad
journed. When President Shaffer came
down to go home he was again asked for
some statement as to the condition of the
conference and a probability of a settle
ment. In reply he said:
"There will be no statement given out
to-day. I expect to call another meeting
of the board to-morrow at 10 o'clock. I
will be present at this meeting and will
not be out of the city to-night."
With this statement President Shaffer
left for his home. All of the other officials
who were at the meeting during the after
noon declined to talk strike. They hur
ried away to avoid meeting the newspaper
men. About the entrance of the head
quarters building groups of men were
gathered, all afternoon. Some were mem
bers of the Amalgamated* Association,
who were on strike and interested in the
proceedings. Others were private' detec
tives, who watched every move made bv
President Shaffer and other leaders of the
Amalgamated Association. Shaffer said
he knew of no reason for his movements
being watched, but became deeply inter
ested In the state of affairs when told i
of it-
Decline to Make a Statement.
Three Conferees Absent.
It was after 11 o'clock this forenoon
when the committee met. Three of the of
ficials. Secretary John Williams, Assistant
Secretary M. F. Tighe and National
Trustee John Morgan were not present.
It was subsequently learned that the
three absentees were 'out of the city and
had taken their departure on early trains.
It was said later that they were expected
to be present when the board shall be
called together to-morrow morning.
Where they had gone and- what their mis
sion was could not be learned. President
Shaffer was called to a secret conference
with some one, supposed to be a repre
sentative of the United States Steel Cor
poration, during the early morning hours.
At noon the officials adjourned for
lunch. They remained away until after
2 o'clock and then again took up the con
ference. President Shaffer was called re
peatedly to the telephone and talked long
and earnestly with some one at the other
end of the line. Recesses taken at fre
quent Intervals showed that much of the
time of the meeting 1 was devoted Â¦ to the
killing of time during the absence of the
officials who were on mysterious missions.
Joseph Bishop, secretary of the Ohio
Board of .Arbitration, was present at the
discussions to-day. He left the headquar
ters late in the afternoon without making
any statement. At 4 p. m. President Shar
fer and Vice President David Reese left
the offices. President Shaffer in
formed the reporters that no state
ment would be given out to-day. The two
officials went to the Carnegie building,
where they held a brief consultation witn
Joseph E. Schwab and Preston, who spent
most of the day in the Carnegie offices.
Within an hour Messrs. Shaffer and
Reese returned to the general offices of
the association.
The second day of the executive board's
deliberation was notable for many ru
mors in circulation and for the conspicu
ous dearth of results. The absence of
three of the principal members of the
board from the sessions to-day gave rise
to the story that the members were di
vided In their ideas of the peace proposals
and that in order to satisty all Secretary
Williams had been sent to New York to
seek modifications at the hands of Messrs.
Morgan and Schwab, while Assistant Sec
retary Tighe and Trustee Morgan had re
ceived a commission â¢ to visit Senator
Hanna to secure his aid in bringing about
an amicable arrangement. 'Nothing tan
gible could be learned concerning these
supposed trips, however, and all talk in
relation to them must remain merely con
jecture until the return of these members
and their lips are unsealed.

COMMANDER IX CHIEF OF 'THE

RICH REWARD.
lurch
Has been rudely defined by some cynic
as "slops and sweets." And after all
there's more truth than poetry in the'
definition. Ice cream and cake may
satisfy the palate, but they are far from
satisfying to the stomach, which requires
that food be nutritious first and nice
afterward. By careless eating women
pave the way for stomach w trouble,"
and its kindred miseries.
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov-
ery is confidently commended as a
cure for diseases of the stomach and
other organs of digestion and nutrition.
By caring diseases which prevent the
assimilation of food it enables the body
to be bnilt up and strengthened in the
only way known to nature â by food
digested and assimilated.
"For twelve long: nonths I suffered untold
misery," writes Mr. Mollie Colgate, of Ran-
dolph, Charlotte Co., Va. "No -tongue could ex-
press the pain that I endured before I com-
menced taking Dr. Pierce's medicine. I was
rot able to do iiaythingf at all. Could not eat
am-tlring- except bread asid teaâ or if I did the
top of my head hurt 6O it seemed it would kill
me; witli all that I could do it would burn like
fire. But now. since using your ' Golden Med-
ical Discorerv' nnd 'Favorite Prescription," I
can eat a littfe of almost anything I want, and
czn do a ;rood day's work as well as anybody
can. Ani better than I have been for years."

f$? *t, T is a good plan for every feather to know
something of the soap he uses. There is a
<$m> well-founded objection to using -a floor-dean-
l$g Â«Â»*I pig-soap upon the human body. Ivory Soap
is the bather's soap. It costs more than common
soaps, but the difference is in the ingredients and
making. Why not treat yourself with a little respect.
Is not the human skin with its marvellous delicacy
entitled to pure soap ? Ivory Soap â it floats. \

WORCESTER, Mass., July 81.â Edward
H. Ten Eycke, the world's champion ama
teur sculler, announced to-day that he
had retired from racing forever. He re
tires a champion who has never been
beaten in a race.
NEWPORT, R. I., July 31.â The boats
entered for to-morrow's regatta of the
Newport Yacht Racing Association are all
In the harbor to-night and ready for the
contest. The chief interest again centers
in the ninety- foot class and the appear
ance of the Independence in new form is
welcomed by all- y*ho have watched the
racing of the big boats. Her managers
and officers .are well pleased with her
condition. The absence of the Constitution
is regrretted, but Inasmuch as the Colum
bia is to appear against the Independence
the critics can still get a line on the Bos
ton boat. /Should she lose her races with
the Columbia it is doubtful if Lawson will
start her again this year. If she should
win even one of the races this week her
programme for the remainder of the sea
son would then be a matter for future
discussion. The future of the boat depends
entirely on her performances to-morrow
and Saturday and everything possible haa
been done during the last two weeks to
put her in trim.
BRISTOL. R. I., July 31.â The Constitu
tion arrived here to-day and the work of
dismantling her was "immediately begun.
It Is expected the new mast will be
stepped to-morrow. This spar is com

"Shortly after the death of his father
Pierre Lorillard Jr. claimed the right to
race them," said Crickmore. "That balks
the attempt of. Mrs. Allen' or any onÂ©
else to use the Lorillard colors on horses
of Rancocas breeding or any other breed
ing.".- .- ' . -
; There was a story to-day that Mrs. Al
len had concluded to retain both Ranco
ca's and the racing establishment and un
der her own name and the Lorillard colors
continue to race : Lorillard's horses both
here and in England.
H. A. Crickmore Sr., racing secretary of
the Jockey Club,- however, declared most
emphatically that the story that Mrs. Al
len had paid the necessary $50 and claimed
for herself tho old Lorillard colors was
untrue, u ' : v, ; : . . ' '
NEW YORK, July 31.â It was an
nounced to-night that T. ' Suffern Taller,
son-in-law of the late Pierre Lorillard,
had j left here for Europe on Tuesday. Ib
Is thought his departure has an Important
bearing on the ultimate disposition of the
Lorillard racing stable. Appraisers are
already at work fixing the value of Ran
cocas and such horses as are there, and
Tailer's mission to England is believed to
be for the purpose of making a valuation
of the Lorillard horses in that country,
with a view of fixing the compensation
that Pierre Lorillard Jr., his mother and
two sisters purpose to offer Mrs. Allen to
relinquish her claim on Rancocas and the
Lorillard horses. ' - - â¢ ; ;

In the evening there was a minstrel per
formance, winding up with a pie-eating
race. D. H. Haines had the whole affair
in charge and was complimented on the
success that was achieved.
The Fourth, on the Kentucky.
The officers and crew of the flagship
Kentucky had a glorious time on the
Fourth in Manila Bay. Here is; the pro
gramme of the day's events:
England has annexed another! island In
the Southern Seas. Niuo or Savage Isl
and is now a British possession and will
be governed from New Zealand, as will
also Raratonga or Cook group. In order
to have regular communication with
Auckland, New Zealand, and thus with
tho outside world by way of the San
Francisco mail service, the Governor of
the new territory had a handsome schoon
er bunt at Auckland and sent to the Union
Gas Engine Company here for an 85
horsepower engine to put in the ' vessel.
The machinery is now on its way and the
schooner when completed will 'be- called
Countess of Ranf urley, after the wife of
the Governor of New Zealand. She Is to
make her first trip this month to the Cook
group with officials who will initiate the
new system of government under the
British flag. The government is to be by
native chiefs under a resident agent of
the New Zealand Government. , Â¦ . . '

SPEEDY HOUNDS
ARE MATCHED
In the two succeeding heats, which
Steve 8 won in 2:24% and 2:2S%, It seemed
as though he almost outclassed his com
petitors, although Belle Hansen was a
good second in these heats.
The 2:13-class pace furnished a surprise,
the almost unknown chestnut gelding El
Diablo, selling as an outsider in the
books, winning from Doc Wilkes, who sold
at 12, King Cadenza' 8 to $2, Margaretta
S5, and John A at S to 5.
In the first heat Margaretta, the 5 to 1
shot, led from wire to wire and won by a
half length from Doc Wilkes in 2:12Â»4. El
Diablo -was at the tetter's wheel, John A
fourth and King Cadenza last. Before tho
next heat aucuon pools sold, Diablo $10,
John A 54, field $7. Margaretta led to the
half. Doc Wilkes at her shoulder. El
Diablo a length behind, John A and Ca
denza herding them. El Diablo pulled to
the outside, went around the leaders like
a cooper around a barrel, and came home
la 2:12>i. Doc Wilkes was second and
John A third. I
Pools shifted and bettors, remembering
the performances cf Sir Albert S yester
day, backed Diablo off the boards. He
won the next two heats in hollow fashion,
2:15^ and 2:17. He is a racehorse of high
class.
The novelty of seeing a half-mile race,
three in five, for the 2:23-class trotters,
attracted the attention of every one. Very
little betting was done, it being conceded
to be almost a "cinch" that Ho Tow's
beautiful McKinney mare Solo would win,
especially . as Bunch, the driver, was
arrayed in such colors that all the rest of
the reinsmen did not dare -to pass him,
eo intent were they in studying the life
like dragon which adorned his back. He
had the fastest and truest little mare
there, and Starter Cohen sent them u la
Fergnson with a flying start at the half.
Solo won the three heats in 1:10, 1:06)4 and
1:09. Bunch was loudly applauded for his
splendid driving. It was a battle from
start to finish. Following are the sum

traordinary the attendance at the race
track "was very fair, and those who with
stood the beat had no reason to regret
their visit. Among the persons in Â¦ the
grand stand was Ho Yow, Chinese Consul
at San 1 Francisco. One of his famous trot
ters was in a race and won. Bunch, the
driver of this winner. Solo, had a magnifi
cent set of colors. The scarlet cap sur
mounted with button and tassel harmon
ized well with the Cambridge blue jacket,
on the back of which was emblazoned a
beautifully embroidered dragon.
The race judges were A. G. Viurnett, D.
Flint and William G. Layng, umersâ John
A. McKerron, John W. Tnomas and W.
P. Harkey. At 1 o'clock two of H. W.
Meek's horses. Iloilo and Isabel, started to
beat 2:3L The former got a record of
2:25%, -Uie latter 2:28%.' The Speedway
stakes, to be contested for by horses
owped by members of the Golden Gate
Driving' Club of San Francisco, followed.
The entries and prices set by the book
makers for each were as follows: Belle
Hansen $1, Steve S $2, Joe Bonney$3, Imp
?2 and Denny Healey 5L
Starter Al Cohen sent them away on
the third score. Imp led to -the half, broke
and never regained his stride until all the
others were 300 yards in front. Steve' S
took the lead, and Denny Healey recov
ered froia a. disastrous break and covered
a half-mile in excellent time. He could
only get within a length of Steve S at the
finish In 2:25Vi.

W. F. Babcock, Captain James Bruce
and Howard C, Holmes, representing the
San Francisco TOrydock Company, and E.
Emery and C. H. S. Pratt, representing
the Arctic Oil Works, were present in
reference to the -removal of the floating
docks from Spear street to a point oppo
site Santa Clara and Center streets, ad
joining the Arctic Oil Works. The repre
sentatives of the drydock asked that re
pair wharves to cost about $S5,000 be built.
The Commissioners could not see where
the money was to come from, but the
drydock people showed that the desired
structures were an absolute necessity. No
action was taken in <he matter, but when
Commissioner Kirkpatrick returns from
bis vacation the chances are that the
matter will be settled. ;
The Santa Fe asked permission to run
rails across the outer half of Bryant street
and upon the wharves in that locality.
The drydock people objected, and a con
ference will be held to settle the matter.
The chief engineer was instructed to
call for informal bids for an addition to
the office buildings on the transport
wharf. The work will be -done at once,
providing the army officials remove the
paint shop now located on the bulkhead.
H. . Anderson, has had a '.'toredo-proof
pile" in the mud at old fisherman's wharf
for the last twelve Â¦ years. He now asks
the' commission to draw the pile and see
how it has stood the test. The matter
was referred to the chief engineer.
Williams, Dimond & Co. asked that
the old structures that menace Steuart
street wharf be removed. Many of them
are on State property and the others are
on city property. A fire started in one of
them would sweep Steuart-street wharf.
The matter was referred to the board's
attorney for an opinion. â¢
The Ariel Rowing Club asked for a club
house site at the foot of King street. The
matter was referred to the chief wharf
inger. ' â¢
certain transfer men against Chief
Â¦WTiarflnger Henderson was begun. F. W.
Kotelman and several! other witnesses
told their stories, and -then the matter
â¢went over until ex-Governor Budd returns
from his vacation. There was apparently
so little of real merit to the charges that
the Commissioners wanted to pass the
whole matter, but Chief Wharfinger Hen
derson Insisted upon having the charges
gone Into fully. - :

Hair preparations and dandruff cures, as
a rule, are sticky or Irritating 1 affairs, that
do no earthly good. Hair when not dis-
eased grows naturally . luxuriantly. Dan-
druff is the cause of nine-tenths of all
hair trouble, and dandruff is caused by a

to kill the germ, and so far the only hair
preparation that will positively destroy
the germ Is Newbro's Herpicideâ absolute-

LITTLE . ROCK, Ark., July 31.â Ten
thousand persons saw Jim Anderson,' a
negro, hanged here last Friday. Among
the spectators was young Lemoyne Jayne,
a son of Porter Jayne, a carpenter. After
the execution the lad inspected the scaf

scaffold. He Invited one of his playmates
to take the place of the condemned man.
Falling in this he sought to play the dual
role of executioner, and the person con
demned. He adjusted the noose around
his neck, stepped on the trap and the
drop fell. His neck was not broken, but"
he is unconscious, and the doctors give
no hope for his recovery.

Strikers Make Attacks Upon a Few
Non-TJnion Men.
N. F. Peart, a United States customs
inspector, was struck from behind yester
day morning by unknown ruffians and
knocked down, kicked and beaten into un
consciousness. He had been sworn in on
Tuesday and was on his way to drive a
dray for the Overland Transfer Company
with goods to the Appraiser's store. He
was removed to his home, where he now
lies in a critical condition. Under direc
tion of Acting Customs Surveyor Chaun
cey St. John, several John Doe war
rants were obtained from the United
States Attorney and they will be served
upon the assailants if found, or upon any
others who may interfere with or assault
a Government officer. Mr. St. John ap
plied yesterday to the Secretary of the
Treasury through Collector Stratton for
authority to appoint fifteen additional
customs inspectors under pay to guard
non-union teamsters engaged in hauling
bonded eoods and also on their way to
and from the stables.
Strikers who are arrested for attacks
upon these customs inspectors will be
tried before Federal courts.
Roscoe Horn and William Ferguson, the
two colored non-union teamsters for Em
mons & Co., who fired several shots Tues
day morning at strikers and wounded Pe
ter Lynch, appeared before Judge Conlan
yesterday on the charge of assault to
murder. They were represented by At
torney Joseph Coffey, who was retained
by the Employers' Association, and after
being instructed as to their rights, the
case was continued for ten days, as it
wll> take that time before Lynch Is able
to leave the hospital. The Judge sal 1
that he would increase their bonds to
$1000 or 5500 cash, as he believed that $100
was entirely inadequate. They were or
dered into custody, but were soon re
leased, Coffey putting up the additional
$S00. - - ' Â¦"
C. F. Blair, a recent imported teamster
from Bakersfleld, was set upon yesterday
morning at Buchanan street and Golden
Gate avenue while on his way to the sta
bles of Smith* & McNab by a gang of
strikers. Blair feared trouble and Â¦ drew
his pistol. The weapon refused to respond
to the trigger, which probably saved the

John Heaney, an old man, who has
been driving a team for Whlttler, Fuller
& Co. since the inception of the strike,
was brutally beaten last night by a num
ber of striking teamsters at Fourth and
Townsend streets. Heaney had been at
tending a meeting- of Red Men on Post
street, and after the meeting took a walk
with a number of strikers who met him
and- spoke to, him of the benefits to be
derived from a membership In the union.
He answered their arguments by telling
them .he was satisfied with the position
he occupied. This enraged the men and
they attacked him. After knocking him
down and kicking- him his assailants ran
away. Heaney is the father; of a large
family and resides at Twenty-second and
Point Lobos avenues. His wounds were
dressed at the Emergency Hospital.
Edward A. Logston, a teamster, was
arrested last evening by Policemen Kear
ney and Dow and charged at the Central
Police Station with carrying concealed
weapons. Logston had a large dagger
concealed In his pocket. He was cap
tured at the teamsters' headquarters at
Fourth and Townsend streets. Accord
ing to his story Logston was a non
union" man until yesterday morning,
when he was induced to join the ranks
of the strikers.
H. L. Manning, who Is employed by the
Cahill & Hall Elevator Company, com
plained to the police yesterday, that he
had been assaulted by a number of strik
ers yesterday morning at Fremont and

He had purchased a revolver to T^e pre

the meantime the men closed In on him

ugly scalp wound and bruising his face:
He was taken to the Emergency. Hos
pital, where his injuries were dressed. He
stated that while he was being assaulted
two of Curtin's private detectives stood
by and did not attempt to assist him.
Edward Selma, a teamster for C. Lippi,
218 Washington street, applied at the
Warrant Clerk's office yesterday morning
for a warrant for the arrest of Policeman
Duncan Matheson on- the charge of bat
tery. He said he went to Mission-street
wharf yesterday morning: for a load of
corn. Matheson came up to him and told
him to "get out of that." He jumped
from his wagon to explain, when, he al
leges, Matheson knocked him down and
hit him with his club, inflicting a scalp
wound. The Issuance of the warrant was
deferred till Matheson's explanation could
be made.

San Francisco is quite interested in preserving
among her objects of interest the herd of- sea lions
which have so long inhabited the group of rocks
which lie within her borders. There are many things
she could better spare.
We trust that not one of these fine and interesting
marine animals will be condemned and shot. That
bit of life on the rocks adds interest to the view of the
ocean. Those who sail blue water recall how like a
desert the far seas are, with scarcely ever a sight of
marine life. The coast waters are equally dreary, if no
creature intended to inhabit the waters is ever seen.
If some vengeful," greedy and destructive people had
their way there would riot be left a large animal in the
water nor on the land, nor a bird in the air, and man
would lord it over a world that he had stripped of its
living things other than himself.
Over-fishing by men and not by sea lions is re
sponsible for any shortage in fish. Abuse of the close
season, taking fish under size and other violations of
the regulations designed to protect fish are respon
sible for the decline in the supply. Man is to blame,
and he diverts attention by asking a death warrant
for the sea lion.
When men came here and began keeping tab. on
their partners in life of the lower orders there were
thousands of sea lions where now are hundreds, and
there were also millions of fish where now are thou
sands. Of course the sea lions then were eating
fish as they do now, but now there is only one sea
lion where ten were feeding. Invoking mathematics
in behalf of the lions, only one fish is being eaten
now -where ten used to be consumed. Where are the
nine? â¢ ,.
THE attempt to exterminate the sea lions should
be watched with care. The desire and disposi
tion to exterminate the life that nature placed
on the earth should be curbed. The large land ani
mals are rapidly going, and in a few generations will
exist only in their remains in museums. Wantonness
unconnected even with a desire for gain has destroyed
the great sea cow of Alaskan waters, an amphibious
animal of such amiability that its capture was not
even sport, yet it was hunted to extinction. The
same fate is overtaking the walrus.. Our sea lions
are next in order. They are accused of eating too
many fish, and as they will not substitute kelp for
fish as food the demand is made for their destruction.

No Invention since the building of Iron
steamships' has been of so much interest
as this to those who travel on the sea.
The terrible fog, which causes 300 wrecks
a year on the English coast alone, has
lost its dangers to a vessel equipped with
long-distance ears of this self-operating
kind.- -V s '
matically hear and announce the ap
proach of oth^r- vessels. Even the click
ing of the machinery of a small tugboat
five miles distant will be repeated on the
pilot's gong.
Then he made experiments with a bell
and was so successful that he obtained
the assistance of Professor Gray, who
was perhaps the best authority In Amer
ica on practical acoustics.
For eighteen months they experimental
at Mr. Mundy's home in Cape Ann, Mass JL /
and finally perfected the present sysreai 7
of signal bell and receiver.
"Why not signal under water? HÂ» re
membered how, when a boy, he had
struck two stones together under water
to deafen the other boys who were diving'.
The Idea of submarine signaling first oc
curred to Mr. Mundy in 1398. While spend
ing his vacation on the Mississippi River
he" noticed the continual stoppages that
the steamer was obliged to make merely
to obtain a short message or order from
some one on shore.
The inventor has made a proposition to
the Government that a signal bell be
placed at every ten miles off the coast,
every bell to ring a different signal and to
be marked on the chart.
By this means, in fog or darkness, every
ship within twelve miles of the coast
could at once tell its location. Professor
Gray, Just before hlg death, patented an
improvement on the receiver, by mean3 of
which the pilot can tell exactly from, -what
direction the signal bell is ringing.
Mr, Mundy has exhibited his invention
to Admiral Hlgglnson, chief of the Na
tional lighthouse Board, and to Admiral
Bradford of the Navy Department. Theso
officials" have . watched the experiment
with great interest and are considering
the adoption of the device on board Amer
ican warships and along the coast line.
The recent loss of the steamship City of
Rio de Janeiro, which went ashore In thi3
harbor, would have been prevented If one
of Mr. Mundy's signal bells had been
within twelve miles. A loss of more than,.
100 lives and over a million dollars* worth
of property would thus have been pre
vented.
Taken altogether, with .every allowance made for
drawbacks, Nome appears to be in a flourishing con
dition. On that frozen coast the American people
have once more demonstrated their ability to fit up a
city in a year's notice with all. modern improvements.
Nome is no longer a "camp." It will soon be asking
an appropriation from. Congress to adapt the port
to the increasing demands of its commerce.
Another note announces: "Almost every' steamer
is landing, one or more victims of misplaced confi
dence; people who on the outside were swindled into
buying some wildcat Alaska property and coming
here to shovel in the promised gold find a bogus lo
cation notice plastered over some other man's valid
claim." In connection with that statement there is
pertinent interest in the announcement in another
column: "This is going to be a poor year for claim
jumpers. The judiciary of the several districts tribu
tary to Nome has taken its cue from the prevailing
public sentiment, and it is safe to say that every such
offender hereafter found guilty will get the ;full ex
tent of the penalty prescribed by the code."
Better news is contained in the announcement that
a rural free delivery system has been established in the
country adjacent to Nome. That sounds like a very
high order of civilization indeed, for there are. some
very prosperous rural communities even in our oldest
States that have not yet^a free mail delivery.
The mining news is There is, how
ever, a complaint of a lack of water for sfuicing in
some of the districts where the placer indications are
good. An expert prospector is quoted as saying:
"There seems to be gold in greater or less quantity
under almost every footprint made in a day's circuit
over the tundra, creeks and foothills around Nome,
though even at this season of the year one is obliged
to walk for some considerable time without finding
enough water to quench his thirst."
That is a very good showing of municipal business
for a town of the size of Nome even if it had been
in wbrking order for "many a decade, but that is not
all. The -,same copy of the News -has the regular
American complaint of inefficient /street sweeping.
The declaration is made that "unless the City Coun
cil takes- some action that will enforce the daily
sweeping of the newly paved streets, within another
month the planking will be covered with from two
to four inches of dirt." Then follows'the suggestion,
"What is the matter with utilizing the prisoners and
making them earn the grub they now eat. t Mly in
jail?" . . . Â¦ .
From a report of: a meeting of the v City Council,
for example/it appears action was taken to petition
the 'postmaster to provide a more prompt delivery of
mail pouches from incoming steamers; the Fire
Chief recommended renting a new engine-house with
ample room for the various equipments of the fire
service; a committee on schoolhouse was given fur
ther time to make a' report; there was a lengthy de
bate on the selection of a site for the city hall; a
petition for street planking in the west end of the
town brought to light the fact that collections for
such purposes were coming in very slowly and city
warrants were being sold for 75 cents on the dollar;
it' also resulted in the passage there and then of a
resolution that hereafter the payment, of the^ labor
bills for street improvement will have to be guaran
teed or paid in advance; there was a petition against
the proposed opening of a new street, and, , finally,
the secretary of the School Board was authorized to
purchase; supplies based upon an attendance of 150
children. "
Y^-^i OPIES of the Nome .News, just received,
r â¢ : contain items showing that what was but ; a
Vâ^ mining camp a sliort time ago has already
attained something of the conditions of a well-ordered
American community. There is a wide variety in the
life there. The papers are by no means confined to
mining notes for news, and a considerable portion of
their space is given r to ' matters relating to improve
ments of. one kind or another.
"CONDITIONS AT NOME.
.In our complex society there is no room for power
not regulated by law nor responsible for its acts and
contracts. .
Corporations* were curbed by law so as to pre
serve their usefulness and minimize their harmfuloess.
Whatever organization has the power to inflict the
same harm and the will to use it must be legally
curbed in the same way,- or the community will cease
to" tolerate it. * - '
If the Southern Pacific not only refused to haul
fruit out of the San'Joaquin Valfey, but tore up the
Santa Fe tracks to prevent that" road from performing
the service, the State would inflict exemplary^ punish
ment on the corporation. If one steamboat corpora
tion on our rivers refused to " handle perishable
products, and dynamited rival boats' that were per
forming that service, and lives were lost, somebody
would be legally hanged. We will not assume the
obtuseness of our readers by stating an analogy, phy
sical and legal, which occurs to any one familiar. with
current events.
If when the fruit is ripe and the market ready
for it every transportation corporation in this State
should arbitrarily refuse to handle fruit in California
.because there . existed a dispute over the. coke rates
in, Pennsylvania, every fruit-grower would have cause
of action against the defaulting corporations and a
recovery of value down to the last box lost, unless
the corporations could show physical inability, from
causes "over which they had no control. If one cor
poration, in addition to refusing' itself to handle fruit,'
should by unlawful violence prevent another corpora
tion which was willing to^handle it, the'offending di
rectors, managers and agents would be summarily
cast in jail and subjected to the most serious penal
ties.
When capital comprehended. the power of organi
zation and the partnership by evolution became the
joint stock company and that the corporation, it was
soon seen that the corporation, having perpetual suc
cession and legal immortality, was a vast power for
harm and oppression unless its legal .responsibility
were made equal to its power. Corporations are still
criticized, and continue' to deserve it, but the vast
body of the law of corporations is testimony to the
wisdom of man in curbing the power of organization.
As a corporation was a. representative of human self
ishness organized to avoid individual responsibility,
the law first made it an artificial person, to sue and
be sued, thereby enforcing its responsibility. Upon
this artificial personality is built "an elaborate system
of law' for the benefit and protection of the public.
The issue of assignable shares of" corporate stock,
the liability of stockholders, the protection of their
rights as trustors against the corporation as. trustee,
the limitatipn of corporation ownership by public
control, corporate liability to employes, all testify to
the prudence and caution and intelligence of man in
curbing the harmful and preserving the useful power
of organization.
The labor situation requires him to enter the con
tractual relation with labor unions and their business
agents. These contracts, or agreements, vitally affect
his business. They may. put it entirely out of his
power to defend himself against loss and bankruptcy
by the transfer of vital objects of interest beyond his
control,- putting them in the hands of those to whom
they are not important. But whatever they are they
are legally enforceable only against him; he cannot
enforce them against the other party to them, for
that party is incorporealâ it has neither legal body
nor estate.
Looking over 'the. mass of reasons, and of crimina
tions and recriminations, and considering: the means
used to secure demands, and above all looking at the
loss of a summer's wages to labor and a summer's
profits to business and the risk of a panic, the impres
sion is dear that these struggles are largely avoid
able by equalizing the legal responsibilities of the par
ties. The employer is always under the restraint of
responsibility to the law.' The law' implies against
him a contract for the protection of his employes; it
dictates the sanitary conditions under which they work
and such conditions as affect their, safety; it gives
a superior lien for their wages, and turn where he
may the employer reads "Thou shalt," and "Thou
shalt not," written in the law for his restraint. His
property, is hostage for all contracts, expres*s and im
plied, and must respond to the last penny.-
In view of the important ' consequences that may
come out of these strikes one is impressed by the
issue of such harmful results out of the causes al
leged in many cases. Selecting at random from many
of the statements made, it is surprising the number -
of cases in which men assure their employers of con
tentment with wages and hours, -and declare they
struck because they were told ta do so. In other
cases men were not aware of a grievance until they
were informed of it by some expert in that line.
The circulation of currency has been impeded by the
strike, and there is atrophy of trade. The wage
workers affected are not earning and they are not
spending. If they are maintaining their families as
well as before it is by the use of credit with the re
tailer, who, if the situation continue, must go to the
wall, thereby affecting the credit of the wholesaler
and of the banks. It is apparent, then, that the strike
has in it the germ of a credit panic, and if prolonged
sufficiently will reverse the prosperous conditions of
the country and bring on hard times. It is not for
gotten that the panic of 1893 was preceded by the
stubborn strikes of 1892. â¢ .
THE trade of San Francisco has been adverselj;
affected by the strikes, which began with the
machinists' walkout on May 26. Human in
1 genuity has not devised any better way to keep' the
capital of the country in circulation than by the pay
ment of- good wages to labor. The entire stock of*
money in this country is paid to labor about three
times over every year. There be those who de
cry the wage system, but they have. never suggested
anything in its place which will equally serve the pur
pose of keeping money flowing. As it flows it reaches
every part of the industrial system of the country and
builds them all up, and flows on, just as the blood
carries the bone and tissue building. material with-it
for even distribution as it circulates through the body.
The quantity is not reduced by the process, nor its
potency for construction. But impede the circulation
and construction ceases and growth stops.
THE STRIKES AND TRADE.

CROCKKTT, July 31.â The strike of the
warehousemen at Port Costa and vicinity
was officially declared off to-night. The
stevedores and hoisting engineers are still
out, but hope is entertained that a modifi

Front Federation will be made so as to
permit them to resume their work at this
end, as it will in no way interfere- with
the labor troubles in San -Francisco.
This morning at 9:30 o'clock a steamer
load of Chileans arrived from San Fran
cisco and were distributed among the dif
ferent warehouses here. This so incensed
the warehousemen that a committee was
sent . to the superintendents asking for
.their withdrawal. Upon this being re
fused, the warehousemen took the law
into their own hands and a- rush was
made for the imported "blacks." Tho
Chileans, seeing .; the warehousemen
coming at double-quick time.v took to

but when it was shown them that the
present trouble would be settled as far as
they were concerned without the necessity
of their walking out, the men decided to
remain at work for a time, at least.
Gray Bros, employ about seventy-five
teamsters. " The men are In sympathy with
the other teamsters now on strike, and
were prepared to fall into line on demand.
The walkout was resolved upon, but last
evening notification 'was received from
the federation that for the present at
least their co-operation was not required.
Gray Bros.' Men "Will Wot Strike.
continue harmonious relations, one with thÂ«
other, and each recognises the fact that
their interest* are mutual and each prom
ises to do everything in Its power to pro
mote the welfare of the drayage business
in San Francisco; and the brotherhood
does hereby agree that It will not cause
cr sanction any strike or boycott whatso
ever; and it is expressly agreed that no em
ployes of any member of the Draymen's As
sociation Â£ha!l take it upon themselves to
strike or make any threat of striking as
against their employer, and it is distinctly
agreed and . understood that if any euch
strike is threatened or attempted the
employer shall have the right to discharge
all members of the brotherhood who may
participate in it, and the brotherhood
agree* to immediately furnish other men to
take their places.
This agreement shall remain in force for
one year from date of its original signing,
viz., until December 19. 1901. and shall, at
its expiration, be considered as renewed for
> the term of one year more unless either
narty hereto shall give written notice to the
other party at leaft Jhrw months prior to
the expiration thereof of its intention to
terminate this agreement,- and no strike
cr lockout shall take place in any event.
or under any circumstances, until after the
giving of the above mentioned notice.
The Brotherhood of Teamsters refused to even
consider the above proposition, but laid the
came on the table, as I was Informed by their
committee. The above is more than almost
any other employers are â¢willing to concede, and
is what many unions .are demanding, and yet
the Brotherhood of Teamsters refused to agree
to fubmit their disputes to conference of ar
bitration, but insisted upon their right to have
everv new question that arose settled as they
alone might determine.
On July. 6, 1S01, Mr. Casey came to me and
The drivers for the Stetson-Renner Drayage
Company refusing to do this work, Mr. Stet
son had to notify the Government that he was
unable to carry cut this contract. The Gov
ernment is now doing this work with their own
teams from the Presidio. Mr. Stetson ordered
four teams on the same day to haul goods from
the railroad for the Morton Drayage and
Warehouse Company, as the Stetson-Renner
Drayage Company has done more or less work
for the Morton Drayage and Warehouse Com
pany for the last twenty years. The drivers
also refused to obey this order. Mr. Casey,
in his statement on July 28, 1901.- refers to sev
eral items which I will endeavor to ansver;
the first as to the hours of work required
prior to the organization of the Brotherhood of
Teamsters, he says from 5 a. m. to 3 "and 9
p. m., which is true, but I can go him two
hours better, for when I drove team for Flem
mlng & -Stetson in 1S75 I have put my team
into the, stable after 11 p. m., but this only oc
curred once In a while, and the drivers know
that they remain on the stand many hours do-
Ing no work at all, and leave for the barn at
S o'clock very frequently.
The Globe Drayage Company did refuse to
Join our association, and the foreman of the
said company said he wanted to get out of
the drayage business, nnd asked me why I
did not buy him out. I told him I would If
we could agree on the price, and I bought him
out and paid him the cash. Mr. Casey was
tickled to death to hear that I had done this.
The brotherhood did call the three union driv
ers out. only two obeying. the order, the third
man, Charlie Newman, refusing to quit, and
was expelled from the brotherhood for . his ac
tion. I voluntarily told Mr. Casey several
times to send me a ' bill for the expense of
these two men called out, but never received
the same, although our association has no
agreement to pay such claims.^
Mr. Casey refers to the Haslett Warehouse
Company operating flat trucks. It Is true that
such work by - the Haslett : Warehouse Com
pany I was injuring *our business, and Mr.
Casey was most willing to interfere for the
reason that this work was being done by non
union labor and Mr. Casey was very anxious
for this work to be done by his union men. He
even went further and told us . we should . not
allow the Eureka and North Point- Warehouse
Company to - operate their flat â¢ trucks. ; Mr. :
Casey did* not succeed In stopping the . Has
lett Warehouse Company, from ODeratlng flat
trucks. And with a view of : adjusting this
matter I did try to assist in â¢forming a ware
house Â¦" association which -' all warehousemen
agreed to Join except the Morton Drayage and
Warehouse Company, ; and as this firm would
and did not sign the ! warehouse - association
was a failure. The effort in this matter was
to get a share of the short haul from ship to
warehouse, as that is better hauling than haul-
Ing the long distance across town, and , a re
duction was made Â¦ to have Roods â¢ from ships
or steamers to Â¦warehouses, distance one-third
of a mile, for from 25 to 40 per cent off 'our
regular price; for. Instance, we agreed to haul
cement - from . ship to ; warehouse, "Â¦ 2000 ' barrel
lots and over, at 20 cents per. ton.'. -
Answers Casey's Statements.
On July 16, 1901, the Commissary Department
of the Government telephoned to Mr. Stetson,
member of the firm of . the Stetson-Renner
Drayage Company, asking him to call at their
headquarters, there being told that the Morton
Drayage and Warehouse Company had losf their
contract, ' and asking Mr. Stetson if ho was
prepared to do this work, owing, to the Mor
ton DrayagG and Warehouse Company being
tied up by strike. Mr. Stetson telephoned to
Mr. Morton and asked him if this was true,
and told Mr. Morton that he could get the
contract. Mr. Morton told Mr. Stetson to go
ahead if you can get it. â¢ I would sooner see
you get it than some outsider. Mr. Stetson
was asked by the Government officials for a.
price, which was named, and a contract was
drawn and signed by Mr. Stetson for the Stet
eon-Renner Drayage .Company. Mr. Stetson
was immediately givftn orders to ship twenty
tons of merchandise \ from ,the headquarters
at Spear and Market streets to the railroad.
Mr Stetson called four of his drivers and told
them to ship the goods, telling them that the
contract was with his firm, and that the Mor
ton Drayage and Warehouse Company had
nothing to do with It. The driver shipped the
BOdWs all right. Mr. Stetson was told to call
at the commissary at about 9 a. m. and get
orders for about 100 tons to be shipped, but on
the same morning, July 17. Mr. Stetson re
ceived the following letter from the Brother
hood steward: . '
"Mr Adam Baker, Steward of the Stetson-
Renner Drayage Company: Toil are herebv
notified to inform Mr. Stetson that we will
positively refuse to recognize any sub-con
tracts from . Morton's customers while this
trouble is on. By order of the grievance com
mittee. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, Secretary.
rany, we had no other alternative. When any
draying firm Joined our association we could
not, nor did not in any case ask the firm to
give up any business they were doing at that
time.
In conclusion I desire to eay that v/e have
yielded time and again to demands of the
brotherhood, and have endeavored to conciliate
them in every way, but the . more we tried
to make things run smoothly the greater their
demands became. It seems that they mistook
our desire for peace for cowardice and sought
to press home every little petty complaint of
every driver until finally patience ceased to
be a virtue, and the question had to be fairly
met whether we should run oar business or
turn it over to our drivers. The success of
the brotherhood encouraged others toj make
equally unreasonable demands until the' whole
community felt that this issue had to be met:
Shall unions control every detail of the busi
ness, or shall they be ctfcfined to the question
of wages and hours of labor, over which there
has never been any dispute so far as we are
concerned? GEORGE RENNER.
Manager Draymen's Association.
In reference to overtime, all cases of over
time that were allowed by the stewards of
the respective barns' were ' paid by the bosses.
There were a great many abuses on this point
where the drivers did not try to reach home
until overtime took effect, and were turned
down in many instances by the stewards them
selves. Â¦ Â¦ .
Continued From Pagre Two. â¬
DRAYMEN'S ASSOCIATION.
We again called a meeting of the Draymen's
Association, and It ' was there voted to place
the entire matter In the hands of the executive
committee with full power to act; and as the
meeting on" July 10, 1901,' had voted to stand
by - the Morton : Drayage â¢ and' .Warehouse ] Com-
We think and say that if it was wrong for
union men "to haul baggage It was wrong to
haul grain ' to the Morton Special Delivery
stable, to furnish a union driver on truck at
W. & J. Sloane & Co.. to work alongside non
union drivers of the Morton Special Delivery
for the last ten' months; also hauling furniture
machinery, merchandise. In fact, . any work
that the Morton Drayage and Warehouse
Company had been doing for the Morton Spe
cial Delivery for the last nine years. If one
is wrong, all Is wrong; if one Is right, all Is
right. We have no interest in â¢ the Morton
Special Delivery, and It is -none of our busi
ness whether the Morton Special . Delivery Is
unionised or not.
On July 16. 1901, the Morton Special Delivery
telephoned to the Morton Drayage and Ware
house Company to send teams to the ferry to
haul baggage to 408 Taylor street. A driver
by the name of Johnson (a union driver em
ployed by the Morton Drayage and Warehouse
Company) was ordered to haul this baggage,
as he has done" this same work for the last
three years, often going to Oakland on the
boat with his team for the baggage. Mr
Johnson refused to go, and was - Immediately
ordered to put up his team in the stable and
was discharged for disobeying this order as
were also about twelve or fifteen other team
sters. Mr. Morton then telephoned to the
Stetson-Renner Drayage Company to send a
team to the ferry for baggage, which this Arm
did. and they hauled the baggage. He also
telephoned to Farnsworth & Ruggles, J B
Bocard Drayage Company and McNab &
Smith; all of said firms sent teams and hauled
baggage. I immediately called our grievance
committee and drew up the following com
munication which I delivered myself in per
son to Mr. Casey at Brotherhood headquarters
July 16, 1S01, at 6 p. m. :
"July IS, 1901.
To the Officers and Members of the Brother
hood of Teamstersâ Dear Sirs: You are hereby
notified that your Interference in the conduct
of the business of the Morton Dray-age and
Warehouse Company is unlawful and entirely
unwarranted, and that your refusal to handle
the baggage of the numerous guests of this
city Is a blot on Its good name and fair re
pute, and you are further notified that unless
you Immediately cease such . interference alr
agreements and arrangements shall be consid
ered as having been broken by you, and you
are notified that if the notice given to Mr
Morton is not withdrawn by or before 6 a m"
Â°Â£ Ju . ly I 7 * i m i then *" arrangements between
the Brotherhood of Teamsters and this associa
tion shall be considered at an end. Yours trulv
"C. K. T1LDEX. President. -
"WM. RAUBINGER JR. . Secretary
"GEORGE RENNER, Manager
t ? a , ...I â¢ "-Draymen's Association."
Instead of this order being withdrawn Mr
Casey went to the Morton Drayage and Ware
house Company stables on the morning of
July 17. at about 5:45 a. m.. and asked Mr
Morton if he was going to reinstate the meii
that he had discharged the day before Mr
Morton answered that he would if they obeyed
orders. Mr. Casey said they would obey all
orders except to haul baggage. . Mr. Casey
told Mr. Morton that he could haul everything
as he had heretofore for the Morton Special
Delivery except baggage.. Mr. Morton answer
ed Mr. Casey that the men will obey all my or
ders or none. Mr. Casey then went into Mr
Morton's stable and called out every driver in
Mr. Morton's employ.
Johnson Starts the Trouble.
told me that he would not allow the Morton
urayage and Warehouse Company to haul the
bapgage for the Morton Special Delivery. I
told Mr. Casey that he should see W. R. Mor
ton and he might possibly agree not to do
this hauling; but my opinion was that Mr.
Morton would not consent. Mr. Casey saw-
Mr. Morton, and reported to me that Mr. Mor
ton insisted on doing the hauling, as he has
been doing this work as well as other worK
for the Morton Special Delivery for the last
nine years. I begged of Mr. Casey not to
give this order, and told him that It would
cause trouble. I afterward was informed by
W. R. AiOrton that Casey called on him and
gave the order that his men would not be
allowed to haul the baggage, but could do
all the other work that he had been, doing
for the Morten Special Delivery- Mr. Casey
came to me again, and as the Draymen's As
sociation had a meeting on July 10, 1301 I
tcld him that I would present the matter' at
our meeting, which I did in its fullest detail
and the association voted to stand by Mr
Morton. The Morton Drayage and Warehouse
Company, W. R. Morton,' proprietor, is a
member of our association, and employed none
but union men as drivers. The Morton Spe
cial Delivery Company, H. D. Morton, proprie
tor, does not belong to our association and em
ploys only non-union men. Two separate and
distinct firms, although brothers.
Dimmick is residing in Oakland, occupy
ing apartments at 669 Eleventh street.
His wire and children are with his father
in-law. Judge Wright of Santa Barbara.
Inquiry for Dimmick at his residence late
last night brought forth the answer that
he was absent and his comingrs and goings
were so Irregular that the time of his ar
rival home was very doubtful.
"I retained Mr. Dimmick during this
month because he could be of much as
sistance at the -work In hand. There was
much questioning to be done and his posi
tion during this month was by no means
a sinecure."
"So far as Cashier Cole is concerned,
his status is unchanged. There has been
nothing done affecting his position, except
that he is under suspension. I am not
ready to say at. this time what further ac
tion will be taken. The Treasury Depart
ment has authority above me In the mat
ter and I shall abide by such direction as
I may receive from Washington.
"The appointment of chief clerk is my
own and I have decided to place Mr. Day
back in the position he held before Mr.
Dimmick was named.
his services would be dispensed with o-
June 30.
"On June 29 the Irregularity in the
Mint was discovered. After preliminary
investigation I decided to retain Mr. Dim
mick another month, hoping that we
should be able to clear up this matter. He
knew that he would not be kept there
after August 1. On July 3 we gave up
hope and were forced to the conclusion
that some clever and daring thief had
stolen the gold from the vault. Since
then the public has been given, through
the press, some knowledge of the labor
that has been expended in an effort to
solve the mystery of this theft.
WALTER N. DIMMICK. chief ,
clerk of the United States I
Mint, was dismissed yester
day from the service of the
Government, 'Superintendent
Frank A. Leach notifying Dlmmlck that
his employment -would be terminated. The
Superintendent has appointed Ben W.
Day, computing clerk to the Superintend
ent, to the vacant position. Mr. Day was
chief clerk for six years prior to the ap
pointment of Dimmick, and for two years
has been In the Superintendent's depart
ment.
Since the discovery of the $30,000 theft at
the Mint and the suspension of Chief
Clerk Dimmick Mr. Day has been filling
the latter's position. Dimmick, according
to Superintendent Leach, has not been
discharged from the service because of
the shortage. He was to have been re
moved on July 1 and had been given three
months' notice that with the close of the
last fiscal year he would no longer be re
tained.
The disclosures following the discovery
of the theft of the six baps of double
eagles led Superintendent Leach, so he
cays, to retain Dimmick another month.
Mr. Leach gave out the following state
ment last night concerning his retirement
of Dimmick:
"With an earnest desire to do wrong to
no man I want to gay flatly that Mr. Dim
mick docs not leave the employ of the
Government because of the Mint thefts.
I had decided last spring: to make a.
change in his position. On March 1 Mr.
Dimmick was notified by me formally that

BOSTON, July SI.â The American Cotton and
Wool Reporter will "say to-morrow of the wool
trade:"' v Â°
The market continued on an even keel, with
continued cheerfulness, a more or less uniform
amount of business and with more or less of
a conviction that the market Is to sell higher
in the future than the prices of j the present.
The â¢ fact â¢ that buyers have been â¢ paying high
prices out West shows that they expect to sell
at better prices here. . Â¦ Â¦ â'*
Mills I generally have orders enough I to keep
their I machines running through I August and
perhaps through September, and they have had
to-buy wool i to execute these -orders. Â¦ '
'The sales of the week in Boston wre 6.790,000
pounds domestic and 310,000 foreign, making a
total of 6.100,000 pounds, . . against a total of
6,570,000 for the previous week and a total | of
3,268,500 for the corresponding week last year.

â¢ Harrison's circular says: . "Since the first
of last month there have been the following
arrivals of coal from Australia, viz.: Royal
ist. 4000 tons; Irene, 1227 tons; Montebello, 3C0O
tons; Australian. 3370 tens; total. 11,597 tons.
The engaged list of coal carriers from Aus
tralia (loaded and to be loaded) foots up nine
teen vessels, with a carrying capacity of about
60,000 tons, which shows an increase of about
20.000 tons during the month of July. At this
time last year there were on the chartered list
ffrpm Australia forty-five vessels with a carry
ing capacity of 110.000 tons. The principal rea
sons assigned for this shrinkage of tonnage are
the high prices of coal In the colonies, the high
freights heretofore ruling there, and the- sub
stitution of oil for steam grades of coal here
locally. The decline of about four shillings per
ton In coal freights from Newcastle in the
month of July is gradually increasing the num
ber of charters being made to transport coal to
San Francisco. If it Is ever- anticipated that
Australian coal will regain Its former posi
tion there must be a special price made to
meet this. market at the points of shipment;
The coal market of Honolulu is reported to be
seriously overloaded with Australian, and
absurdly ! low prices are being named for car
: goes which have arrived there unsold. This
will tend to increase the loading list at New
castle for this port, and -should cause a further
decline in coal freights."

NEW YORK. July 31. â There was no lndi
i cation this morning of any awakening from
the lethargic state In which the stock market
has been during the whole of this week. A
spasmodic dip was effected In the stocks of
the United States Steel Corporation at the
opening on the failure of the Amalgamated
Association to agree upon terms for settling
the strike at their session i yesterday. The
whole market opened down in sympathy under
the attack of the professional traders. But
the subsequent action of the market demon
strated Its professional character. The open-
Ing dip, following yesterday's decline, repre
sented the extent to which small traders were
willing to commit themselves, and they com
menced to buy to cover short contracts and
take their profits, if possible. - In the absence
of any important Interest in the market these
day-to-day varying fluctuations- :Â»re all that
can be expected. The policy of What are called
the larger" interests,, pending the i-?velnpment
of new factors, including the seltlemnt of the
steel strike, seemed to be pretty clearly de
fined by these Indications. By buying stocks
freely during the period of liquidation, they
accomplished their purpose of ' supporting
prices. When prices advanced they were will-
Ing to sell out the holdings which were taken
purely for supporting purposes, but were clear
ly undisposed to attempt an extensive advance,
until the situation clears Itself. The market
Is thus left fallow, except for the efforts of a
small contingent of professional operators
whose attempts to move prices are of small
efficacy. They secure no following when they
bid up* prices and they induce no important
liquidation now when Â¦ they offer them down.
It is noticeable that railroad authorities are
willing to concede rather more damage to the
corn crop, now that the drouth is effectually
broken,: than they were during the period when
the securities of their companies were .under
pressure of liquidation. With the turn of the,
month, some light replenishment of the" money
market is looked for as the result of dividend
and interest disbursements, . which are,* how
ever, small. The most important is the divi
dend on United States Steel preferred of 1%
per cent for the quarter, involving an outgo
of about $9,000,000. This doubtless had : much
to do with the small flurry in the call I loan
market late in the day which helped the move
ments of the traders to put down prices to
about the lowest of the day. . Intimations that
the strike settlement 'negotiations were not go
ing -smoothly helped to this end. The closing
was weak. United States Steel fell an extreme
2?4 and the preferred 3Vg. The most conspicu
ous feature, next to these, was Norfolk and
Western, which rose nearly 3 points on a per
sistent demand, which was without . explana
tion.
I The bond market was Intensely dull and lr-
I regular. Total sales, par value, $910,000.
United States bonds were all , unchanged on
the last call. . . -

"The stock market has offered excellent trad
ing opportunities and this situation seems like
ly to continue. A few stocks which had ad
vancrd to unreasonably high or control price*
are Ftlll beyond the reach of investors, and
should be handled carefully by speculators.
There are others which have shown declines
of I5@30 points that are much eafer and more
profitable. Several heavy blows have been
dealt to the market, which at the present level
has displayed excellent resisting qualities. Li
quidation has been very thorough and Etocks
neve been passing into stronger hands for the
last month or six weeks. The monetary situa
tion is steadily improving: bank reserves Beem
iikely to increase during the next few weeks;
gcMlt coming in from the Klondike, and' the
Treasury will shortly begin to disburse funds
mere freely; consequently there is little chance
of disturbance In the mosey market until the
-rop movement begins. No further untoward
fle\ elopments have taken place abroad, and the
quantity or American securities over there has
b^en so greatly diminished that our stocks will
tie lees sensitive to foreign disturbance than
formerly. Altogether, the situation is one de
serving a. fair degree of confidence. The
known bad features have been for the present
fit least probably discounted, and the c#untry
t'iil continues on Its prosperous career. When
the bis operators again take a hand,' refreshed
fcy vacations, we may look lor a more active
tEsrket." Â¦ -. ' i .V;
"The turn in the drift has been impelled prin
cip2l!y by three very real and substantial
cauree, all cf which have been sudden and
unexpected: <l) the injury to the crops, <2) the
great etrike 'of the employes of the steel corpo
ration, and (8) the uncertainty of a money
market which may possibly be subjected to un
usually heavy and urgent demands for move
ment of the crops.
"A reaction from the recent unprecedented
rise in the prices cf securities was to be ex
pected. With such an extraordinary Increase
In the earning power of the railroads, such a
xnarvelooe run of national prosperity, and such
en unrestrained buoyancy in every business In
terestâto eay nothing of the excitement de
veloped by the great corporate deals â it is not
at all remarkable that the market value of
lailroad investments should have risen to such
unparalleled figures as we have lately seen.
That tendency having exhausted its force, it
is not a matter of surprise that a sharp reac
tion has eet in from the upward impuse. For,
net a few of the large buyers on the rise
bought less because they were convinced that
the new level of values would prove permanent
than because they believed that the new Inflat
ing conditions would produce a temporary un
cqualed enhancement in quotations. Their ex
perience under all sorts of conditions of specu
lation had taught them that maximum values
never prove permanent; and that, when the
top has been reached, an impulse of reaction
mug-, have its eway, which may as easily as not
carry values as much below the normal as
they had previously been forced above it. That
is a fixed law in the operations of the Stock
Exchange, which must always sooner or later
Â£Â£scrt its sway, and sometimes in disregard of
conditions that legitimately determine the
\'alue of investments. The course of the stock
market during the last two weeks lias been
a marked verification of this principle.
The New York clrudor of Henry Clews says:
Conditions in Wall Street.

Late mail advices from New York say:
â¢Peaches are scarce and firm, with a very
good demand for medium grades. Prunes con
tinue in light supply, particularly 40-oOs, which
are held firm at 6%c. Consumptive demand
lor both Prunes and Peaches is unusually ac

tfamase to 6mall fruits almost everywhere from

PREPARING FOR BUSINESS
The Supreme Court in bank decided yes
terday â¢ that proceedings for divorce may
be carried â¢. on even though alimony or
dered by the court may be unpaid. The
practice of Judges heretofore has-been to
refuse to permit a continuation, of pro
ceedings when the party directed to pay
thÂ« alimony, was delinquent.
- The case was instituted by J. /W;. E."
Allen, who claimed. ihat his marriage was
fraudulent. He was ordered to pay costs
and $20 a month. He failed to pay the ali
mony and was cited for contempt. It /was
shown In the Superior Court that he iwas
unable to make payment and the case
was dismissed. An appeal ." was taken.
The only provision made by the Supreme
Court is that the defendant must furnish

The evening was > pleasantly , spent i In
conversation and a - supper concluded the

Some sixty guests in all were present

C.'F. Peterson, vice president, and A. S.
Wollberg, secretary of . the Vedanta So
ciety, were assisted in receiving the guests
by a reception committee consisting of
the following, named ladles: ,
A reception was given last night to
Swami Abhedananda I by the Vedanta So
ciety at the residence of Dr. M. - Logan,
770 Oak street. The Swami Is an eminent
philosopher of Calcutta, India, and is at
present stationed at New York, where- he
has engaged in /disseminating the doc
trines of the . ' 'Vedanta philosophy." .'He
is making a tour of the coast and the
Vedanta Society of this city arranged to
have him meet some fifty pupils of a class
organized to study the teachings of j the
vedanta:
Now that the time has been extended
for thirty days, it Is supposed that the
bars will be opened indefinitely. The liquor
men of this city took the matter up in
real earnest recently, and notified the rail
road company that should the saloons be
closed on the Southern Pacific's boats thsy
would transfer all their freight business
to the Santa Fe road. ~ Â¦Â¦;_;,
The saloons on the ferry-boats will not
be closedâ at least the time was extended
yesterday by President Hays for th'rty
days. This is a victory for the liquor men,
who have been fighting tooth and nail to
get President Hayo to reconsider his or
der abolishing the sale of liquor on the
ferry-boats and steamers.'
Shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon, H. Flannery, who owns the privilege
of selling liquor on a number of the Oak
land ferry-boats, was notified that his
time had been extended thirty, days.' It is
presumed that Influence was brought to
bear on President Hays, and that he noti
fied Manager Kruttschnitt that he had re
considered the order. .
Judge Conlan ' took \the matter I of issu
ing the warrant under advisement, prom
ising to announce, his decision this morn
ing at:ll o'clock. -Â¦Â¦.-â¢Â¦â¢ \ ,-:
"It was this^way,", explained- Lewis.
"Miss Logan loaned me the ring and one
evening 'after I had worn it for several
months I invited her to go with me . to
the theater. ' I wore the ring that even
ing in rriy; scarf and it got turned around.'
Miss Logan adjusted it for me, and I said
to her. 'It's pretty near time you gave
me that ring, isn't it?' Thereupon she
answered: : 'You can have it." I never in
tended to take it back from you.' ",
When Miss Logan spoke In this gener
ous fashion, Lewis .claims he < answered,
"That is awfully gopd'of you, little girl "
and then as a return gift he says he sent
her 4000 oil shares. If Miss Logan will
return the oil shares to Mr. Lewis, Mr.
Lewis declares he will give her back hÂ»r
ring. Â¦'.',;: -Â¦ ' \-: Â¦:Â¦'-Â¦Â¦:Â¦> Â¦ .â¢-â¢â¢ .- Â¦',- â¢-Â¦Â¦-,.
According .to : Miss .Logan's -version of
the ring story, she simply loaned Lewis
the ring at' his /urgent; request, so he
might wear- It to go to an out of town
banquet. .;â¢Â¦ '.-Â¦â¢Â¦:-. .-Â»/ '.- Â¦ , .. Â¦ ri
- "I never grave it to him," she said "and
as for that oil stock, 1 will not return it.

him." Â¦ Â¦<Â¦.. >â¢ "". . Â¦ Â¦Â¦: . - '..-" â¢Â¦Â¦., :Â¦'" -',... - . ..â¢ .: ...
As for the ring, Lewis claims Miss Lo
gan loaned it to him for a period of sev
eral" months and. then gave It to him, he
in return giving her 4000 shares of oil stock
valued at 5 cents per share. ' |
According to Lewis' story, instead of
him having any property or security that
belongs to Mrs. ; Waldron the lady is In
debt to him to the amount of several hun
dred; dollars,' $200 of which he claims he
advanced to her, the balance being money
due him for services rendered. , ;
Mrs. Waldron and her pretty young
daughter. Miss Alda Logan, went before
Judge Conlan yesterday to /swear out a
warrant for the arrest of Paul Redfleld
Lewis, an oil broker, on a charge of em
bezzlement. -Mrs.. Waldron' claims that
Lewis has got away with about $1500 be
longing to her and considerable oil stock
that is her rightful property. Miss Logan
demands the return of a valuable opal
and diamond ring that she claims she
loaned to Lewis. _ .

Baltimore passenger train from the east,
which was due to arrive in the Grand
Central station, Chicago, at 9 o'clock to
night, was held up by five masked men at
8 o'clock to-night between Edgemere and
Grand Calumet Heights, Ind., thlrty-ona
miles out from Chicago. One of the mail
cars, which contained no money, waa
dynamited and wrecked. The attempt as
robbery waa made after the two mall cars
had been detached from the train and run
a quarter of a mile ahead. The failure
of the robbers to make a rich haul was)
due to the fact that the express car.
which contained the train's treasure, was
in an unusual place. It was the third
car in the train. After wrecking tho :Â¦
mail car and obtaining no booty the men
disappeared In the darkness without at
tempting to rectify their mistake. Tha
only loot that they carried away with,
them as a result of their adventure waa
the gold watch of the engineer.
The train was the New York and Wash
ington vestibule limited. Most of the*
trainmen were shot at and had narrow
escapes from the bullets. No person waa
injured either by the dynamite or fire
arms. The place where the robbery ocÂ»
curred -is a lonely district where houses
are few and far between.

BALTIMORE, July 31.â The Democratic
State Convention, which will meet at
Ford's Opera-house, this city, at noon to
morrow, promises to be thoroughly har
monious. In the preliminaries.- which
closed yesterday, no bitterness has been
developed except in Montgomery County,
where the friends of Senator Bouic are
sore- over his defeat by Spencer Jones, the
administration candidate/ The delegates
to the coming convention, with, unusually
few exceptions, are strict organization
men and there will be no kicking over the
traces. The only nominations to be made
to-morrow are candidates for Controller
and Clerk of the Court of Appeals. At
this time there seems no reason to doubt
that Dr. Joshua W. Herring will be
nominated for Controller and that J. F.
Turner will get the other place on the
ticket.
, As to the declaration of -principles It
seems clear that no mention will be made
of national issues. .Nothing will be said
about the currency, the tariff, imperialism
or anything of that sort, but every plank
In the platform will be confined to State
Issues. Prominent among these, it is un
derstood, will be the negro vote problem.
Although the leaders will not admit it,
there is every reason for believing that a
strong declaration will be made upon thi3
subject, following closely along the lines
laid down by the Democrats at their re
cent convention in Frederick County, the
home of Colonel L. Victor Baughman, for
merly one of Senator Gorman's lieu
tenants, In which it was decided that the
danger of the negroes ultimately holding
the Dalance of power In Maryland is Im
minent unless something is done to check
their right to vote.
Th3 course of the State administration
in convening the General Assembly in spe
cial session last spring for the purpose
of passing laws to disqualify illiterate
voters and the taking of a State census
will be upheld.
The platform is being carefully drawn
with a view of getting every vote pos
sible for the Democratic nominees for the
Legislature. Gorman has taken part in
many conferences upon this subject and
the list of nominees in the various coun
ties has been carefully scrutinized and
revised by his friends, it being- a recog
nized fact that upon the success or failure
of the party to carry their legislative tick
ets, so as to have a majority in the coming
Legislature, wjll depend Gorman's fu
ture career as a politician, In so far as the
State of Maryland is concerned. That
he will be chosen to succeed Senator "Well
ington in the event of Democratic success
is regarded as certain.
NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 31.â The "Pro
gressive Democratic party" was organ
ized here to-day. The attendance was so
small that many doubted. up to 1' p. m.
whether any. attempt would^ be made to
hold a State convention. During the week
following the recent Democratic State
Convention a conference was held at
Cleveland and a protest was issued
against the action of the Democratic con
vention in ignoring Bryan, free silver and
other issues.
Â¦ George A. Groot. who called the confer
ence at Cleveland, was both temporary
and permanent chairman to-day and waj
made chairman of the State Committee
of the new party. The convention was
held in his 'room at the Great Southern
Hotel. The promoters of the movement
did not disguise their disappointment over
the small attendance. The total attend
ance did not exceed thirty, though the
formalities of .a State convention were
carried out. . - .
The features of the platform are lauda
tion of Bryan and reafflrmatlon of the
Kansas City platform. - Planks were, also
inserted, calling for the public ownership
of all public utilities and that all money of
whatever kind shall be issued by the Gov
ernment without the. intervention of
banks. The destruction of all trusts is
demanded.
A committee on nominations reported
the following ticket, which was nomi
nated: Governor, Dr. Rudolph Reemlln:
Lieutenant Governor. Henry C. Cordery:
Supreme Judge, Rial M. Smith; State
Treasurer, J. C. Shepard; Attorney Gen
eral, S. L. Clark; Clerk of Supreme Court.
Charles Bonsall: member of the Board of

is either inherited or in other ways gets into the blood and attacks certain vital
organs or appears in the form of terrible sores and ulcers, while the milder and
less dangerous skin diseases are caused by blood humors or an over acid condition
of that fluid. . These acid poisons, as they ooze out through the pores of the skin,
cause great irritation, with intense itching and burning. The eruption may be of
â¢a pustular kind, with excessive discharge of thick, gummy fluid, or the skin may
be hot, dry and feverish, swollen and fissured. Skin diseases, whether they appear

SEATTLE, July 31.â At a point about
four miles above Selkirk is the big Patter
son logging camp. The logs are stored
for rafts in a convenient slough four or
five miles long, across the mouth of the
slough being stretched a heavy cable hold
ing a boom of heavy logs. . On July 19 the
boom gave way, liberating 400,000 . feet of
loose logs, which are now sailing Daw
sonward without let or hindrance. The
amount lost is about equal to four large
rafts, and valued at $35 per thousand, or
$14,000 in all. - .
Immediately upon the breaking of the
boom all the available men were drafted
into a salvage crew and herculean efforts
were made to stem the flood of logs flow
ing steadily into the open river. Twice at
the risk of life and limb was a line car
ried across the moving logs, but having
once started the moving ma3S of lumber
proved irresistible and snapped the lines
like twine. The men followed In Â¦ boats
and a few logs have been made fast to
islands or turned into blind sloughs, but
most of tlie logs are divided and scattered
and are believed to be hopelessly beyond
reclaim. â¢ The advisability of attempting
to bocm the Yukon has been discussed
and abandoned as Impracticable, owing
to the steamers, swift water and expense.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OP THE PACIFIC COAST
The Charles D. Lane was formerly
called the Irrawaddy, and was purchased
in the winter of 1903 In New York -by the
Wild Goose Company, who placed her on
the Nome-Seattle run. First Officer Tom
Riley of the Lane, arriving on the Sena
tor, states that no blame can be placed
on Captain Ames, and says that they had
been running along in the fog for twenty
four - hours and the strong current set
them in on the rocks. It was very thick
at the time the steamer struck.
The story of the disaster reached Nonw
July 21 by a party of six men. Among
them were A. Rpbertson, a waiter on th<Â»
Lane, and J. E>. McKay of Seattle, who
was a passenger on the Steamer, togetr.er
with four others, also passengers. These
men left the wreck of the Lane on tile
morning of the 14th in the Vega. All of.
the Lane's passengers, forty-nine in num
ber, were transferred to the Vega on the
night the steamer was wrecked. Thire
was no confusion or disorder. The schoon- ,
er turned back for Nome on the morning
of the 14th at 7 o'clock. Some stores and
supplies were taken from the Lane -to the
Vaga. Water, however, was scarce.
The Lane left Nome July 11, and en
countered 'f ogrgy weather most of the trip.
She was running under a slow, bell when
she struck the island, and the Vega; being
In tow, also struck the ledge of rocka and
was somewhat damaged. The Vega made
considerable water, but It was kept dovÂ«rn
by the pumps until the damage was re
paired.

. IN SUIT FOR DIVORCE
It did not appear that the gardener had
received any funds which belonged to the
State and the commission could find no
grounds "for civil" action. '.
Dunn. admitted that he had received a
25 per cent bonus on materials sold to the
State by- a; contractor named-Lewis, but,
he claimed that the money came as a gift
and was. not paid according to prearrange
ment. He became alarmed at last,'how
ever, and* left the State.' w
Attorney General Ford states that ac
tion may be instituted under section 70
of the Penal Code, which says: "Every
executive or ministerial. officer who know
ingly asks ' or receives any emolument,
gratuity or reward, or any promise there
ot, excepting such as may be authorized
by law, for doing any official act, is
guilty of a misdemeanor." It seems like
ly therefore, that in the event of Dunn's
return he will have to answer for his ac
tions. â¢. . Â¦, , Â¦ ._

Ir.Quiry from the State Board of Barber
Examiners, " issued the statement yester

reason of Â¦ i drunkenness, contagious dis
eases or immorality; ,The Attorney, Gen

plications â¢ for licenses may be refused on
tho grounds mentioned, but that " revoca
i tlon of licenses Issued is Impossible.
The question as to whether M. H. Dunn,
formerly gardener of the State Capitol
grounds at Sacramento and whose where
abouts are at present unknown, is liable
to prosecution, -was . affirmatively settled
by Attorney General Ford yesterday. The
faci was recently established that Dunn

pÂ»-r|-Â«a HE allied bosses under the leader- I
j ship of Kelly, Gage, Crimmins,
11 Herrin, John Lynch and Jerry
U Burke made haste to force the Re
publican State Central Committee
into the local contest, but the interference
Is not proving as effective as they antici
pated. In the olden days of boss domina
tion the employes of the Southern Pacific
Company and the Market-street Railroad
could be relied. upon to pull .the bosses
through in the doubtful districts, but
times have changed. President Hays of
the Southern Pacific will not permit or
ders to go out commanding the men in the
service of the Southern Pacific to line up
for Boss^Kelly at- the primary election.
Railroad passes and patronage will not be
delivered on the order oi the political
boss. There is a little State patronage in
reserve, but every place within the gift
of the administration is covered with ten
layers of promises. "Goods promised
during the prolonged Senatorial contest
are not yet delivered to those who gave
their work for favors to come.
Market-Street Road's Position.
There is a story current in the boss
camp that orders have been given for em
ployes of the Market-street Railroad to
fall in behind Martin Kelly and vq,te his
ticket in their respective districts. There
is no truth whatever in the story that the
company has decided to lend assistance to
the bosses. I. W. Hellman and Charles
Holbrook. officers of the company and
members of the executive committee, as
sert that they have no knowledge of such
orders or of any intention to issue such
commands. The executive committee of
the directors is the governing body of the
corporation, and this committee will not
advise or request the conductors, grip
men or other attaches of the road to vote
for any set of delegates to the nominating
conventions.
Yesterday Charles Holbrook, vice presi
dent of the company, said:
"No orders to support any ticket have
been given by the executive committee
and no one is authorized to Issue such or
ders."
The bosses cannot count on the Market-
Street Railroad conductors and gripmen
for help In this municipal campaign. Prop
erty-ownere and citizens generally will be
gratified to learn that the men in the serv
ice of the road will not be expected to do
politics for the allied bosses. The failure
of Boss Kelly to get help from the rail
way companies accounts for the demor
alized condition of his forces. -It Is obvi
ous to impartial spectators of the fight
that the boss forces are losing heart and
hope. The meddlers from the country
who were so offensively prominent just
before the meeting of the State Central
Committee was called have vanished. Citi
zens shun the headquarters of the Kelly-
: Decrees of divorce were granted yester
day to Estella K. Bethell from Norman

The will of Babette Seligman, widow of
the late Moses Seligman, who died July
26, was filed for probate yesterday. After
making a few minor bequests of jewels to
friends the testatrix bequeaths one-half
the residue of her estate to Max Kohn, a
friend, and the other half to Max Kohn In
trust for the benefit of Jesse Seligman,
decedent's son.
The testatrix states that she purposely
omits leaving anything to her son, Max
Seligman, because he has been undutlful
and urfilial, has brought disgrace upon
her and has caused her untold physical
pain and anguish of mind and heart.
In a codicil, however, the deceased
leaves Max Kohn $1000. He is now under
arrest in Portland, charged with having
defrauded a bank. This $1000 bequest will
be used In his defense, which will be con
ducted by Attorney I. I. Brown of this
city, who is charged by Mrs. Seligman "to
use every honorable means and every ef
fort to release her son from the legal re
straint under Â¦which he now suffers."

A large and* enthusiastic meeting was
held last night at the Republican Primary
League clubrooms at 27 Sixth street.
Standing room was at a premium. An ex

ed, consisting of the following named:
Thirtieth. Assembly District.
Under the auspiqes of the Primary
League Club of the Twenty-ninth Assem
bly District, a rousing demonstration took
place at 830 Howard street last eveninig.
The meeting: was called to order by J. S.
Parry, one of the leaders of the anti-boss
campaign in the district. Vigorous and
convincing addresses were delivered, and
the audience cheered the sentiments in
favor of home rule and clean local govern
ment. The principal speakers were M. M.
Miller, L. E. Savage and Marc Anthony.
In the course. of his remarks Mr. Miller
declared that the newspapers supported
the Republican Primary League through a
sense of justice, as the league was the
only organization in the campaign worthy
of support. In eulogizing the press, he
asked for a standing vote in indorsement
of his utterances, and 500 men sprang to
their feet to indorse the anti-boss pross
in its support of the Republican Primary
League. The fight for good principles in
the Twenty-ninth District is practically
won. ' â¢
Twenty-Ninth District.
The efforts of the Republican Primary
League to arouse public sentiment In tho
cause of good local government are widely
appreciated. The present activity at 'the
office of the Registrar of Voters is mainly
due to the league. The number of transfers
and new registrations signify that a large
vote will be cast at the primary election
en August 13. Citizens should bear in
mind that registration for the primary
closes Saturday, August 3. Recollect that
failure to vote is a half vote for the
bosses. Every citizen interested in the
welfare of San Francisco should take part
in the primary election. . The last hop? of
the bosses and tax looters is the slender
chance of a light vote.
The district clubs organized under the
auspices of the Primary League are reach
ing the masses in every district. The
campaign is beginning to take' on the
character of popular demonstrations in
behalf of clean municipal government.
Appreciate League's Efforts.

general disgust and weariness pervades

The work of substituting heavy for the
now inadequate seventy-pound rails be
tween this city and San Jose Is in prog
ress. From this city to San Jose the rails
now being laid weigh eighty-five pounds
to the yard. South to Castrovllle the
company purposes laying seventy-five
pound rails and from there over the
mountains eighty-flve-pound rails will be
laid. The new rails which already stretch
from Eighth street south are of the heavi
est and look more like the girders of a
modern sky-scraper than the rails in com
mon use. Beside them the old crossings
and switches that have not yet been re
moved look. like the tiny tunnel rails in
the great mines of the Comstock. The
road is also being ballasted and leveled
and it is announced that when this work
is completed the road will be equal to
any in the Eastern States now famous
for their stability. .
Word came i"rom Chicago recently that
between $30,000,000 and $40,000,000 is to be
expended within the next few years by
the Southern Faciflc with the view of
placing the system in the best possible
condition â¢ in equipment- and facilities.
President Hays will devote -much of his
time on the problem, of bringing the road
up to the standard and it was stated that
it * was partially with a view to giving
Hays every opportunity to accomplish the
task in the quickest possible time that
Harrlman gave the traffic of the road ex
clusively into the charge* of Stubbs.
Under the management of the late C. P.
Huntington very little money, compara
tively speaking, was expended yearly for
Improvements and the result is that there
are but few systems in need of such an
immense expenditure. Now thousands of
miles of fifty-two and seventy pound rails
must be replaced with those weighing
eighty-five or ninety pounds, so that the
great 100 and 125 ton locomotives may be
safely operated over them at a high rate
of speed. Curves, especially over the
new coast- route, must be straightened,
grades reduced, roadbeds balanced and
wooden bridges and trestles displaced by.
structures of steel.. Â¦
This work has now commenced and
within five years the larger portion of the
road will be modern and equipped with all
the latest transportation facilities.
Under the direction of President Hays
the great work of reconstructing the en
tire Southern Pacific system has begun.
More men are employed at the railroad
shops at Fourteenth and Harrison streets
than for year3 past preparing the tools
and equipments for the rail-laying corps.

The buildine of this dock will give Mare
Island two of the finest docks In the world. It
means a great deal to Vallejo, for it forever
sets at rest any possibility of the removal of
the navy-J'ard from this locality. The con
tractors have already spent J100.000 in dlggirg
the hole, and they will go ahead with the work
immediately. They are to complete it in thlr
ty-eix months, according to the contract, but
they E&y it will be finished In thirty months.
AH that Is needed now is that the San Fran
cisco merchants insist that the Congressmen
tret an appropriation of $400,000 to dredge the
shoal. Then the largest battleship in the world
can come to Mare Island.
The people of Vallejo greatly appreciate the
pood work done by The Call in having the Sec
retary of the Navy visit Mare Island, for it is
greatly due to his observations there that the
contract was signed.
GEORGE CAMPBELL JR.,
Secretary Chamber of Commerce, Vallejo.
The contract for the stone drydock at Mare
Island was signed yesterday by the Secretary
of the Navy and the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf
Company. The amount to be expended is
Jl.0S9.000. The dock is to be 750 feet long. 80
feet at bottom and 30 feet on the sill at mean
high water. It is to be of etone and cement.
About S3C0,0C0 will be epent in Vallejo for labor.
The stone Is to come from lone. Cal.
The Chamber of Commerce of Vallejo.
when it received notice of the signing of
the contract, sent the following signed
statement to The Call:
It has always been contended that the
erection of a mammoth dock at Mare Is
land would be of little use. as the channel
leading to the naval station was not sup
posed to be of sufficient depth to provide
passage for the large vessels. The sign
ing of the contract is proof positive that
j.he naval officials do not believe the as
sertions made concerning the .depth of
water between here and Mare Island and
that the future of the naval station is an
assured fact.
This means that the navy yard Is not
to be abandoned, as was frequently sug
gested by the evening papers. The dimen
sions of the dock which the contract calls
for show that it will be big enough to
accommodate the largest of Uncle Sam's
men-of-war.
That the \iews of this paper were ap
preciated is shown by the fact that yes
terday officials of the ICavy Department
signed a contract with the Atlantic. Pa
cific and Gulf Company which provides
for the erection of a mammoth stone dry
dock.
The efforts of The Call to secure a prop
er recognition of the value of the Mare
Island navy yard to the United States
naval authorities have at last met with
success. This paper has at all times fa
vored the extension of the natural facili
ties by which the navy yard is surround
ed and In support of its claim has sug
gested time and again that the contract
calling for the building of a wooden dock
at the navy yard be changed so as to
provide for a stone dock.

Samuel Van Praag, an aged cigar dealer,
who conducts | a store at Polk street and
Fern avenue, was held up. by two young
men last evening about 10J o'clock in front
of his residence, 1213 Bush street. The rob
bers became alarmed and fled before, se
curing any money. \
It is supposed that the thug s who at
tempted to rob Van Praag had watched
him for some time and were of the opin
ion that when he closed his store he car
ried home all his receipts with him. Â¦â¢ Last
night the robbers waited till the .old man
started home and then hurried onto his
house ahead of him. To render detection
difficult they turned : out . the street gas
lamp in front of the house and waited for
him in his garden. As soon as Van Praag
started to walk up the garden -path the
robbers jumped out on him and dragged
him to the ground. The victim cried
lustily for help and this frightened the
footpads. They took to their heels and
ran One of the robbers in his hurry to
get away left a black derby hat in" the
garden. It had the initial. M in the in-
S Soon n a"fer the attempted robbery Chief
of Police Sullivan was on the scene. He
was accompanied by several detectives

be able to identify them.
