MYSTERY BAFFLES DETECTIVES.
/ ~T HE murder of young Hislop was one of the most fiendish
**Â¦ pieces of butchery ever brought to the attention of this'de
partment. The sight of the dead lad, shortly after tlie \
crime, eclipsed anything I have ever seen, when his youth and
helplessness is taken into consideration.
"I cannot state what are the chances of capturing the as
sassin. The suspect zue how have is lacking in the nerve it would
require to do so terrible a deed. Still, we will not release him un
til we are satisfied that he is absolutely guiltless. The crime zvas
committed by some one with whom the lad was acquainted. That
much Jias been established. Fear of exposure prompted the deed
tliat was executed by a bend. If the murderer came to commit
burglary, which I think he did; he was clumsy at his business.
Bui he may have come for some other purpose, and therein lies
the mystery. Whatever transpired that night was known only to
the victim whose lips are forever silenced, and his slayer." â
Opinion of Captain John Seymour, Chief of Detectives.

MURDER RECALLS SIMILAR MYSTERIES.
THE brutal killing of young/Hislop by some unknown/flend. re calls the mysterious murders of 1
Eugene Ware and Miss Harrington in this city severdi years ago. In both these cases the police
were unable to get even the faintest clew to the asjfessins. > ' . . .! V ; '
Ware was a clerk in the Sfc ; Nicholas pharmacy/on- Market street. One morning , he Was
found murdered, having been stabbed no lessthan Ifrenty! times. All the available police talent
was employed on the case, but not the slightest clow^was *>und which would tend to unravel the mys
tery. The detectives who worked on the case were always iifclined to beliove that the fiendish, crime was
committed by a morphine fiend, v: hose cravings for the, drfg ; made him desperate. ' '
Miss Harrington was foully murdered by some unknfwn fiend while she was asleep in her flat on
Ellis street. After killing her the murderer -set fire to, ttt house in the hope of destroying the evidence
of his dastardly crime. Ex-Chief of Police Lees, who wasthen'in charge of the detective department,
learning that ex-Senator Buck had been a friend of the rfirdered woman, sent a detective to bring him to
his office. Buck lived in Oakland, and when told the mis/on of the detective, he jumped- into a cart
and started to drive to the train. On the way he was thrjwn out, breaking his neck. / ..
In many respects the killing of Miss Harrington riembles the mysterious murder of young Hislop,
except that the house in which the latter met his deatif was not set on fire. Like Hislop, the'unfortu
nate woman was alone when the unknown fiend enteredfthe house and murdered her.
From tne beginning of the search after
clew's it was pointed out that no burglar
except the merest tyro would have killed
the boy under such conditions: It would
have sufficed to have choked him Into in
sensibility and have left him 'bound and
gagged, and being In no danger from the
boy's attack a burd f would ' have re
frained from murderJ' . \ Â¦ ;
'.- No or othucjiolsej'was heard in
the HJslop home by fVe women. living in
the flat below until ne parents returned
and discovered' the cjme. j '
Lights were left liming in several
rooms,, and many: circumstances Indicate
the murderer's familiarity; with the prem
ises and knowledge' that he. was tempora
rily safe from 'molestation. Â¦,â ;.
Herman Lutchard/a' Norwegian butcher
who formerly roomed at the Hlslop' home,
is held at - the City Prison as a" suspect,
FOUL murder In most atrocious
form was done Saturday night
and the best detective skill of
the police force has been at
work constantly since the crime
was discovered without obtain
ing the slightest satisfactory clew either
to the murderer's identity or the motive
that prompted the horrible deed.
Some fiend incarnate stole upon 13-year
old Robert Hislop as he lay in bed. his
mother's kiss fresh upon his lips and the
coverlet snugly about him. tucked in by
her loving hands. Blows were aimed at
his head with desperate strength, and not
content merely to strike a fatal blow the
monPter in human form slashed at the
boyish face with a knife, until nearly a
ecore of wounds had been inflicted. This
as the boy lay with his face away from
his cowardly assailant.
Bo much lies on the surface and Is
patent to every searching detective. But
the motive? What prompted the mur
derer to strike the blows that robbed the
harmless boy of life? Who is the monster
and what was his purpose?
, No answer except merest theory has
been given to these questions. Robbery,
It now seems -certain, did not prompt the'
deed. No valuables were taken from the
house so far as can be ascertained, and
all the circumstances indicate that some
other purpose *purred on the murderer to
bis unspeakable crime.

Whether the, deed was the work of an

fearing" arrest, of some insane wanderer

much' of a mystery as it was at'thebe

â¢' M. . tives' : Edward Gibson, Wren,
; '.^? Â¦: ' pinan, Reynolds . and Riordan
running down various clews last
â¢ -7^^ night, but at midnight they were
as' far 'away from a solution of
the mystery of the murderer and
hip motive as they were when they
started.
"It is a hard case," remarked the head
of the- .detective department, "but I have
hopes that we will ultimately fasten the
crime on the right man. .Lutchard tells a
straight story. . but he is* so densely ig
-norant It Is difficult for him to explain
away^ the circumstances that' point to him
a*. the, murderer. Thus far I have .been
unable" to find . any evidence* which would
establish^ beyond the possibility of a doubt
that he committed the foul crime. He
gives a good account of himself on the
nlght^of.the murder, even to detailing his
movements between the hours of 7 and 10
o'clock,' between which', the awful crime
was committed. I intend to hold him until
, I am thoroughly satisfied that he had
nothing to do with the murder."
. Several of the detectives who are work
ing on 'the case are thoroughly convinced
that Lutchard is innocent.
"He" seems to be a harmless fellow,"
said one of them, "and not a man who
would commrt such a foul crime. -He has
accounted for his movements during â¢ the
time that the murder was committed, and
his 'Â¦ statement is corroborated | in many
particulars by ' his companion. Smith."
The suspect was closely" questioned last
nlgh't, but his answers did not differ ma
terially ;from the ones he gave when he
was first examined except that he said he

Discovery of the Crime.
>_Young HJslop resided with his parents
and 'brother fat? 104^ Halght 'Â¦Â¦ street.- His
father,'. Robert ,C. J Hlslop,*. conducts a fur
niture, store at 341 Hayes street. The boy
: attended [the' John Swett Grammar School
and his application to study placed him. In
the -foremost rank - in ; his class. -, He' was
popular J and as f a r as Is . kno wn had â¢ no
enemies. â¢;
Captaui Seymour's Men Work on Clews
That Lead to No Important Develop
ments and Leave Them in the Dark
When Ilislop closed his store he took a.
short walk with his wife. As the couple
approached the house Mrs. Hlslop noticed
that there was light, in the front parlor,
arid this alarmed hef. ."< She expressed
her " fears to her husband." 'The'
latter opened ', thu . front - door hur
riedly, with < his latch key and in a mo
ment, had. gained the head of. the stair
way. He ' glanced in. the direction of the
room occupied by the. boy. , The door was
ajar and \ the- light burned brightly. Ho
* It was the habit of Mrs. Hlslop to -walk
to her husband's store each evening and
accompany him home. Robert, usually
went with her. On Saturday night after
the dinner' hour she prepared herself for
the trip, but the boy did not want to go.
He first said he wanted to study and then
that he was tired, having: spent much of
the day down town. About 8 o'clock, tha
boy was In bed - and his mother, after
tucking the covers about him,' kissed him
good nicht and . left the house. Before,
going. she turned out the lights in every
room except, the ore occupied by the boy
and' told him she would return soon.
Accompanied by Detective Harry Rey
nolds young Smith, who was with Lut
chard Saturday evening, traversed th*
route taken by them on the fatal night.
He pointed out the places they had vis
ited, but was unabl<? to fix the time with
any degree of accuracy. He claims that
after leaving: thÂ© drug store they walked
up Market street to their home. Ha says
they reached their lodgings between 9 and
10 o'clock. Satisfied that the young man,
was telling the truth. Captain Seymour
allowed. him to go. .
The detectives were working late last
night on the theory that young HlÂ»Iop
may have been murdered by a Japanese
who, had turned burglar. It was first re
ported that the Hlslops had recently en
gaged the services of a Japanese servant,
but as he did not suit he was discharged.
As it was' reasonable to suppose that hÂ©
might have committed the foul crime
through revenge Captain Seymour sent
one of his men to interview Mr. Klslop.
The latter exploded the theory by declar
ing that he had never employed a Japan
ese as a servant or In any other capacity.
Captain Seymour placed little impor
tance . in the contradiction and explain*
It by saying that Lutchard might have
been confused when accused of being thÂ«
slayer of the unfortunate' boy.
"I made a mistake." he explained when
asked about the matter. "I meant to Â«ay
that wo. went to a restaurant instead of
a saloon."
and Smith had visited a restaurant dur
ing the evenlpe and had something to eat.
When first questioned by Captain Sey
mour Lutchard claimed that he and SmlUi
had gone to a saloon and partaken of
several drinks.

The decision was reached after one of
the most spirited discussions ever hold
within the sacred circle of the Supreme
bench. . ; â¢ Â¦ _.
There is Â» a . dlsjientlng opinion.' The
World correnpondent is lnformeÂ«l, and has
every reason to credit as a fact, that
politics has out no figure in this great
controversy, that there was an honest and
exceedingly rarnest division of opinion.
When the decision iÂ« announced It will
be found that the opinions handed dewn
by the dissenting Justices will be very
long, very thorough, very elaborate In
their discussion of the Important points
at issue.

LONDON, May 26.â Thirty-two bodies,
Bome of them terribly mutilated, have
been recovered at the Universal colliery In
Sengbenydd, in the Rhondda Valley,
where an explosion occurred last Friday
morning. The grewsoroe work proceeds
"Very slowly, and many painful scenes are
witnessed at the pit's mouth.'
King Edward has sent a message of
sympathy to the families of the victims
and has expressed his . admiration at the
gallantry of the rescuers.
the southbound car, with both legs sev
ered, and was killed Instantly, while the
other one lived but a few minutes.
Fully 120 men, women and children
formed a struggling, shrieking pyramid,
framed with detached portions of human
bodies and the wreckage of the cars.
Some of the less seriously injured of the
men extricated themselves and began to
pull ' passengers out of the rear ' ends of
the two' cars. Almost | every one was
taken pat in this I way and nearly all
were bsdly Injured j
. 'Victims Taken to Albany. .
Men with broken bones, with dislocated
Joints (and gashed heads tried to assist
othersv who were more helpless.. Help
had Â¦ bh\n summoned from East Grean

the Â¦victA.J Â» dying and dead, were loaded

physicians could â¢ temporarily attend the
n-ouiided^they. were j taken to their, homes
or to tljej hospitals. ' - <~~~Z
Withrtibth motormen killed it was hard
to get at the real cause of the accident,
bnt it is^pretty well determined that it
was an attempt of the southbound car to
reach a second switch instead of waiting
for the northbound cariat the .first siding.
The cars weigh fifteen tons each, and are
the largest electric cars built. So fright
ful was the crash j that both cars were
torn almost to splinters. Both were filled
with Sunday pleasure seekers returning
'from the new recreation grounds that the
railway had just opened. ' . ,v
Story of a. Passenger.
Among the passengers on the south
bound car was Deputy Superintendent
Howard J. Rogers of the State Depart
ment of Public Instruction. He was ac
companied by his wife and children, all
of whom were slightly- injured with the
exception of the daughter. Speaking of
the accident.. Mr. Rogers said: .
"My recollection of Â¦ what happened as
the cars came tigether is rather vague.
We were proceeding southward at a very
rapid rate of speed, our car being well fill
ed with passengers, including many women
and children. Fortunately, my wife, my

self was a direct'affront to the teachings
of Tillman and a repudiation of Bryan.
The open breach between Tillman -ana
McLaurin occurred about the time the
South Carolina delegates for the Kansas
City convention were being selected. Mc-
Laurin was. totally Ignored/ while Till
man headed a delegation- of his own
chocsing. McLaurin regarded the : over
whelming defeat of Bryanism as a vindi
cation of his independent course, and his
action in the Senate last winter. In voting
with the Republicans on' all I leading na
tional issues aroused the indignation of
the Tillman faction at home to the high
est pitch. He has been denounced in and
out of the State as an "assistant Republi
can," and charged wlthrthe leadership of
a movement to organize. a white Repub
lican partyMn the South.
It Is understood that McLaurin and Till
man have a tacit agreement to contest for
the long term, to which Tillman was elect
ed last January. Undef the State Demo
cratic party rules the candidate. must de
signate specifically, the office' to : which he
aspires. "Whether McLaurin Â¦ wins over
Tillman,. or Tillman be re-elected jfMcLau

man. / : " '".â¢"."-" ' Â¦ '"Â¦'Â¦'-Â¦.,

Senator, from Aiken; Colonel George John
ston,- ex-Congressman from the Third dis
trict, f and Wiley Jones, . chairman . of the
'State Democratic ' Executive U Committee.
Between Johnston and Latimer, there is no
good feeling,' and this " race may be as In
teresting as It promised to be : before the
conditions were changed and McLaurin, as
it were, put on the offensive, u The Gover
nor has the right to appoint regardless of

One of the pathetic incidents of the dis
aster was the death of Maud Kellogg: of
Round Lake. She was on the southbound

Troy, and Mr. Barry's father. "When the

accommodated between seventy-five and

after we -had passed a switch beyond

as we neared the. curve. There was ab
solutely no warning, so far as my memory
can recall, before the crash came.
"As we dashed around the curve the
cars met with terrific force. With the ve
locity of a cannon ball the car in which
wo were seated fairly plowed the entire
length of the other car before It lost Its
impetus. The crash of the cars was ; suc
ceeded by one of the most awful scenes
I have ever witnessedâ by the shrieks of
men, women and children that layfscat

debris. Mrs. Rogers, our two children and
myself were hurled . toward the front of

which were buried dozens of other passen

At Catabatto, one day out from Zam

trol the town and the trade of the whole

tinued to react here, causing an almost
total cessation of business in the Ameri

PHILADELPHIA, May 26.âCommis
sioners to the ; general assembly I again
supplied nearly all of the Presbyterian
pulpits and those of several other denom
inations In this city and vicinity to-day.
Many persons took advantage of the op
portunity to hear the men whose elo
quence during the week held the attention
of thousands In . Calvary Church, in the
discussion on the question of the revision
of the confession of faith. The leaders of
the several parties that have battled. for
supremacy were heard in the prominent
churches. Moderator Mintq^i delivered two
sermons, one in the morning at North
minster Church and the other in the even
ing at Olivet Church.
~ The debate on the revision of the con
fession of faith, which took up the Â¦whole
of three days last week, will be resumed
to-morrow morning, $ and. It' Is believed
some definite action will have been taken
before the assembly adjourns for the day.
The question now before the assembly
is: "Shall the majority report be adopted
ini its entirety?" This report, briefly
stated, recommends the appointment of a
committee to prepare a brief summary of
the reformed faith the same re
lation to the confession which the shorter
catechism bears to the larger catechism,
and formed on the general model of the
concensus creed prepared for the assem
bly of 1892, or the "articles of faith" of
the Presbyterian church of England. The
report also , recommends this committee
prepare amendments to several chapters
of the confession, either by modification
of the text or by declaratory statement,
so as more clearly to express the mind of
the church. The motions to dismiss the
whole matter and to strike out the recom
mendation In the majority report -for a
brief summary having been defeated; the
contest has narrowed down to a struggle
between the advocates of a new creed and
those who desire only a moderate revision
of the confession. .'-'â¢ â¢-Â¦ Â¦ " -V
It is predicted with .considerable show
of confidence that -the moderate revision

Is placed at 51,200,000. Including the cost
of provincial and Judicial administration,
the Filipino taxpayer will pay salaries
amounting to several millions of dollars.
The amount which will be disbursed an-
nually to the different departments estab
lished is thus estimated:
Philippine Commission and etaff $112,621

a senator.
The contest is likely to be more interesting than
important. It will add a new liveliness to the politics
of the summer, , but is not likely to have any notable
consequences, since it will hardly be taken as a pre
cedent to be followed by wrangling Senators in, other-
States. About the only parallel^to the action.of the
two Senators is that taken by Conkling and Platt of
New York in resigning for the purpose of getting an
indorsement by the Republican Legislature of their
fight against the administration of Garfield. . In that
case both the aspirants for indorsement were disap
pointed, for neither of theffl was re-elected. In the
South Carolina case we cannot expect a' similar result.
It is a foregone conclusion that one of. the two will be
re-elected, since it is too clearly a contest between
rival champions for any outsider to interfere.
It is evident Tillman believes he has a walkover,
for otherwise he would not match his full six-year
term against a man who has but two years of his term
left. On the other hand, McLaurin, doubtless'thinks
he has much to gain by the ' fight and \ nothing
of great importance to lose, since two years in the
Senate' lacking the confidence of his State and' his'
party can be of no high value to a man who has am
bition and a capacity for , making a living outside of
office holding. 'Each of them therefore will enter the
fray with ardor, and the contest is very sure to be one
of the most exciting that the eccentric and dominating
Tillman has furnished to the State. , 9 ; * â¢
McLaurin's position is peculiar..- Elected as a Dem-
ocrat and a supporter of the 'Tillman 5 wing of the.party
in South Carolina; hehas so completely broken away,
I from Bourbon Democracy that during the last session
of Congress \he voted with the Republicans*,on party
measures more "often than with the/ opposition.'-
A SOUTH CAROLINA TEST.
The corner in Northern Pacific! was one of the
great feats of the time; and yet, despite the eagerness
of so many Americans to claim credit of directing
everything that happens, there is not a man connected
with Wall street who will admit that he had anything
to do with if. . .'i .
THE RAIN AND THE. CROPS.
REPORTS from various parts of the State where
rain has fallen give widely differing estimates
as to its effects upon rural industries. In" the
south it is looked upon as a well-nigh unmixed bless
ing, while in other sections it is feared the results will
be on the side of loss^ rather than of gain. Thus,' from
Los Angeles comes the report that, while a great deal
of hay is down and will be injured; materially, the
damage is offset by the good done to young 'orchards
and to irrigators; and it is added: "It is quite likely
a considerable amount of corn and another crop of
potatoes will be put in because of the rairi, which has
left the ground in good condition for planting." From
other counties, however, there are reports .of estimated
damage to cherries and strawberries, -as well as to hay;
and from Visalia comes the announcement that grain
men estimate their loss in Tulare County at upward of
$450,000/ \ ; >
It is safe to say the estimates of damage are exag
gerated., We "are so accustomed to continuous sun
shine during the haymaking months in this State that
tho appearance of rain after the hay is down, seems
like a calamity. In the Eastern States, the haymaker,
would smile at such fears. In that part of the Union'
where spring and summer rains are : frequent a hay
crop that is mowed and cured without- being touched
by rain is an exception to the general 1 rule. It is even
more exceptional . in j Great .Britain and in Western
Europe, for in those lands at this"season' of the year
spring showers occur, well-nigh every week and some-:,
times every . ftay. There is a .way" of curing hay even
though the rain has fallen on it; and although our hay,
is not made .of the same grasses, as. that of the East
and of Europe) it is nevertheless not so' delicate as to;
be destroyed by. a rain if care be taken, promptly and ;
properly, to save it. ', Â¦'='-' , \ Â¦;
-There is such a thing as banking' too much on a'
genial 'climate and becoming overanxious -whenever '
the. weather- varies from the normal, g Consequently,
despite the "estimates of damage 'here and' there, it. is
"quite likely that before': the " season is over i it will be
admitted the rains have done much-more good than
harm' not .only in the south ':Â¦ but -wherever they : have
fallen. It has been a bad enough spring in the way of
frosts, but there is no reason thus far. for being fright
ened by. its. rains.
BUSINESS STILL, EXPANDING.
rr-s RADE conditions continue favorable, but with-
I out especial feature. The crop prospects of the
A country are good, being, indeed, far beUer than
usual at this time of the year, and the yield of grain
promises to be so large that some anxiety is expressed
as to the supply of labor to harvest the crops. Fears
of drought in the West have been dispelled by recent
rains, and, save for the ravages of the Hessian fly
here and there, the conditions could hardly be better.
The export movement in wheat is improving, and a
shortage in the German crop has resulted in large
purchases at New York and Chicago for German
account. Of course, this excellent crop outlook tends
to render railroad stocks very strong, as it means
heavy earnings later on. ""Had it not been for the
recent corner in Northern Pacific stock. and the con
sequent panic in Wall street, that market would prob
ably be lively now, owing to the brilliant grain out
look, but the public has been well shaken out in the
shuffle and shows no disposition to come back again
at present A singed cat fears the fire. In fact, there
is general complaint in Wall street that the commis
sion business is but a fraction of what it was prior to
the Northern Pacific flurry.
The usual commercial statistics, however, point to
continued activity in business all over the country.
The bank clearings last week gained 65.4 per cent over
the same week last year, and, with the exception of
Minneapolis and St Paul, every large city in the land
exhibited an increase. The gain in business, as repre
sented by these clearings, was 89.8 per cent at New
York, 42.5 per cent at Boston, 24.5 per cent at Chi
cago, 37.6 per cent at Pittsbu'rg, 55.9 per cent at St.
Louis, 38.3 per cent at Baltimore, and so on. As the
boom in Wall street has subsided, at least. for the
-present, it is reasonable to suppose ; that this gain in
the clearings represents just so much- increase in the
volume of legitimate trade, especially as the conserva
tive cities, where there is no speculation of any conse
quence, show as much gain, comparatively, as the
speculative centers. The failures," however, continue in
excess of those last year, the number last week being
192, aganist 167 for the same week in 1900.
[The staples show little change. Crude iron is not
as active as it has been, but finished products are'iri
as heavy demand as ever. The West reports an espe
cially active demand for" building hardware, barbed
wire and other constructive material. , Boots and shoes_
continue active, the shipments thus far this season
being 50,000 cases ahead of last year. 1 Leather rules
firm, with a good, demand, but hides are easier at
Eastern points. There is more call for new raw wool,
but manufacturers report continued dullness in woolen
goods. Silk goods, on the contrary, are reported in
very good demand, with an upward tendency in raw
silk. From all parts of the. country come reports of
an improvement in general distributive trade, due to
warmer and sunnier weather.
On this coast previous conditions prevail. Indeed,
the situation has Bhown little change for months: Sea
board and interior trade is active, and the wholesale
merchants consider the _ present year the banner one
thus far. Labor seems to be well! employed, wages
are higher* as a rule than for some years, and the in
quiry for bur, goods Ifor. export shows little 'decrease
from: the phenomenal demand of a year pr so ago,
when it was difficult to find- ships enough to carry
away our produce and merchandise to foreign lands.
The crop {prospects, '*â¢ all -things' considered, continue
brilliant/. and. there. are no serious commercial mis
haps to 'cast a'cldud "on , the sky. '

QNE of the most picturesque and beautiful of the old Scottish castles is
Glamis Castle, the ancient seat of the Earls of Strathmore. It dates
back' to the dark ages,' having been a royal residence in. the time of
King Malcolm, and remained so until the end of the fourteenth cen
tury. At .the, marriage of the daughter of King Robert .II- to Sir 'John
Lyon, in 1372, the lands andthanedom of Glamis were given to the bridegroom by
the King. The present family of Lyon, Earls of Strathmore, is directly descended

Sir Walter. Scott once spent a night at Glamis, in 1794, and in a note to "Wav

has a. prototype at the fine old castle of Glamis, so rich in memorials of ancient
times. It is a massive beaker" of silver, double gilt, molded into the shape of a lion

of Strathinorei which is Lyon, and when exhibited ' the cup must necessarily be
emptied to the Earl's health. The author ought, perhaps, to be ashamed of re-
I cording:that he has had the honor of swallowing" the contents of the-lion, and the
; recollection 1 of the feat served to suggest the story of the^Bear of Bradwardine.' "
5S The walls ofthe castle are' so thick that hidden stairways and passages are"
-, frequent iri' them, and a secret room exists whose location -is known only, to the
feigning Earl, his eldest son and his business manager. The main entrance is sin
gularly small and low, and the door is of heavy oak, studded with iron rails. Di

IMMIGRATION PROBLEMS.
>-> OMMISSIONER POWDERLY of the Im-
I migration Bureau is reported to have said
AÂ»-^ that in his forthcoming annual report to 'the
Secretary of the Treasury he will repeat his recom
mendation for. the enactment "of a law requiring im
migrants to declare v at the time they land' whether or
no it is their intention to become citizens of L the
United States. It is argued by the Commissioner that
the naturalization of aliens is a matter of such impor
tance that when the courts are applied to to admit
foreigners to citizenship they _ should have something
more in the way of information to 'act upon than the
statements of the applicant and those who vouch for
him. ... . , -
Whether or no such a law would be of much ad
vantage can hardly be known until it has been tested.
It is to be borne in taind, however, that the Com
missioner has made a more careful study of the sub
ject than the average member of Congress,' and his
recommendations merit thorough consideration. In
several States aliens are permitted to vote upon a
mere declaration of intention to become citizens, and
it would seem on the face of it nothing more than
right that immigrants having that intention should
declare it upon landing.
The various problems arising from the influx of im
migrants have been made more perplexing than ever
by the change that has. taken place in the nature of
-the immigration. The official records show, that
whereas in former years nearly the whole immigra
tion was from the British Islands and from Western
Europe, the bulk now comes from Eastern Europe.
During the nine months ending March 31 of this year
there arrived 287,120 immigrants. Of that number
69.07S came fromi Austria-Hungary, 71,951 'from Italy
and 52,947 from Russia; in other words, nearly 70
per cent are from races which in former years sent
hardly any emigrants at all. . â¢
' The change is' still more strikingly shown in a
summary of ; immigration for a long series cf years.
According to such a summary, compiled from' official
records it appears that from 1881 to-1890 there arrived
from the United Kingdom 1,466,426; Germfiiy, 1,452,
952;, Austria-Hungary, 353,698;^ Italy,- 30-^6, 'and
-Russia; 265,o64f-- 'From 1890 to 1899, inclusigithe fig
ures are: United Kingdom, 820,463; GerJjjny,J 618,
642; Austria-Hungary, 538,399; Italy^ . 607WW; : A ' and
Russia, 539,587. : During Vthe fiscal year enfled' June
30, 1900, there arrived from the kingdom
48,337; Germany, 18,507; Austria-Hungary? \ 114,847;
Italy, 100,135, and Russia, 90,787.-
No one questions that most of these immigrants
are capable of becoming good citizen's, or that their
labor adds to the wealth of the nation; but , at the
same time it is a severe tax to absorb them into our
industrial and political system, and it is nothing more
than justice to ourselves to exercise a reasonable care
in admitting. them to citizenship, or even to the coun
try at all. It is full time for Congress to grapple with
this subject in earnest, and as a matter of fact it should
be dealt with at the next session. >

That Tillman will be victorious is hardly to be ques
tioned, but McLaurin may make a much better show
ing than some people expect. A very large number of
energetic men in the South have protested agai&st the
domination of Southern politics by Bryanism. : Among

manufacturing and commercial industries of their

masses of the whites has never yet been tested. .It is
therefore quite possible they may decide to make an
earnest effort to show their full strength. in this fight.
It is an off year, and national politics will not interfere

quently, though leading a forlorn hope, McLaurin
may emerge from the : contest defeated, indeed, as

WIRELESS SIGNALS * FOR ; SHIPS.
BY arranging to" establish, a wireless telegraph
'service from' NantucKet lightship* to the island
from whence. dispatches can be sent by cable to
the mainland and thence to New .York City, the New
York Herald provides a means of giving information
of the approach of a ship some twelve or fourteen
hours before it arrives in New York harbor.
The benefits accruing from the improved service are
many. Relatives and friends who wish to meet the
passengers on an incoming steamer -will have such
ample notice of her approach that, as the Herald says,
"Persons residing in Hartford, in Albany or in Wash
ington can remain at their homes until they learn
that a boat has, been sighted, and they will then be in
a position to take a train to the metropolis and reach
the pier before the vessel is made fast. Many vexa
tious delays will be obviated."
The system adopted for the service is that of-Mar
coni, one that has been fully tested, first by The Call
in obtaining news of the arrival of the transport bring
ing home the California volunteers from Manila, after
ward by the Herald and The Call in obtaining reports
of the international yacht race in 1899, and since then
by many other experiments, official and otherwise, by
nations as well as by individuals. It is therefore cer
tain that the system to be established by the Herald
can be successfully operated, notwithstanding the dis
tance to be covered by the wireless messages is up
ward of forty-three miks.
In describing. the enterprise the Herald says: -"To
inaugurate the wireless telegraphic service it will be
necessary to run a pole forty-seven feet above the
mast of the lightship, which reaches sixty-three feet
above the water line. Upon this the apparatus will
rest. At Sankaty Head is a bluff about ioo feet in
height. The pole to be raised there will be 130 feet
high. The South Shoals lightship is of modern con
struction, and is one ofthe most admirably equipped
vessels of her class in the world. She is a two
masted steamer, with main engines of about 350 horse
power, and capable of developing a speed of seven
knots an hour. She has on board an electric engine
of direct coupling dynamo of ninety volts and eight
kilo-watts. There are two powerful lamps forward
and two aft of the mainmast. There are good accom
modations for the captain, mate, two engineers and
crew of thirteen men. There will be ample room
aboard for the engineers and telegraphers required
for the installation and operation of the Marconi wire
less telegraph system. : ; : 'Â¦Â¦'%'
While the service may be confined at first to send
ing to New York information of the approach of a
ship, it will not be long before it, will develop a far
greater usefulness. When ships are equipped with the
Marconi wireless system they will be able to receive
signals and to transmit dispatches should they desire
to do so. The utility of a service of that kind was
demonstrated last month in the British Channel when
a steamer equipped with a Marconi apparatus received
a message from a lightship stationed at sea off Dun
kirk to the effect that the illuminating machinery was
out of order. As soon as she reached port the
steamer forwarded the information to the proper au
thorities and new machinery was sent at once, so that
the lightship did not have to go without lights even
for a single night. , . >
San Francisco has an interest in this story. If wire
less telegraphy can be established of? New York har
bor, why should it not be established by the Govern
ment between this city and the Farallones? It not in
frequently happens that vessels have to wait many
hours off the harbor before entering, and consequently
a wireless telegraph station at the Farallones could
hitcn give notice of the arrival of a -ship as much as
twelve or perhaps even twenty-four hours before she
entered port. That information "would be of great
service. It would, among other benefits, enable the
port authorities to look out for any vessel coming in
during a fog and thus provide against such accidents
as that which befell the Rio.
It would be well for tile Chamber of Commerce, the
Merchants' Association and other influential bodies to
take up the issue and urge action on the part of the
Government. Wireless telegraphy has â¢ ceased to be
,an experiment. It is now a well-tried method of com
munication over much greater distances than that be
tween us and the Farallones, and there is no reason
why we should not have the of it.

A QUEER looking craft Is being fit
ted out at the bulkhead betw'een
Pacific and Broadway for a voy
age to Nome. She is a double
ender,. has an enormous Â¦ beam
with a very light draught and Is schooner
rigged. Her foremast Is stepped well for
ward and she will carry when under all
canvas a. foresail, staysail, leg-of-mutton
sail and a mainsail. The Helen, as the
craft has been named. Is about thirty^
five feet on the keel, while her beam is
about fourteen feet. She was built at
Sausallto and a considerable portion of
the work on her was done by her owners.
When everything is in readiness =he will
clear for St. Michael, but her real des
tination is known only to four people.;
The master of the Helen will be Captain
J. A Lockhart and the chief officer Peter
Olson. A third man will form the crew,
but he will have nothing to do with the
enterprise. His duty will be to mind the
galley and take an occasional trick at
the wheel. With anything like luck, Cap
tain Lockhart expects to make the run
of 2S00 miles to St. Michael in a month
or six weeks, but should it take ten weeks
or three months there will be no fear of
starvation, as a year's supply of provis
ions will be aboard.
Both Captain Lockhart and Mate Olson
were formerly in the employ of the Oce
anic Steamship Company. They are satis
fied that they will make the voyage as
comfortably as on an ocean liner, but the
majority of the mariners who nav^e seen
the craft couldn't be hired to make the
run for love or money. The Helen is
now ballasted and will start loading to
day. She will get away . for the Arctic
Wednesday or Thursday.
ACAPULCO FOR PANAMA.
Mail Company's Steamship Arrives
"With Passengers and Cargo. _
The Pacific Mail Company's steamship
Acapulco arrived from Panama and way
ports early yesterday morning. She was
a day behind time owing to being delayed
at the coffee ports. Among her cargo is
$63,114 in treasure, 19,214 sacks of coffee.
2ZZ! sacks of sugar. 497 sacks of ore. 247
cedar logs. 573 cases of fruit and some
general merchandise.
The Acapulco brought up ten steerage
passengers, sixteen Chinese in transit to
Hongkong and the following named cabin
passengers:
Richard Smithers, Thomas Smith, Charles
Â¦W'ilcox, Thomas H. Oakley, John Angrove, E.
Everett Burgess, Wiliam T. Koch, Henry C.

Electric Cars "in Collision.
A car of the San Mateo line and another
of the Folsom-street line were badly dam
aged in a collision at the ferries yester
day. The passengers got a scare but that,
was about all, the only one who was hurt
being Ralph Cohn, a transfer man, who
escaped with a black eye.
The Folsom street car was the first to
arrive at the ferries, but the automatic
switch would not work, so it ran in on the
San Mateo siding. The motorman at once
backed out. but while he was doinc- so
along came the San Mateo car and
crashed Into the rear of the Folsom street
vehicle. The end of the latter was
wrecked, while the windows of the San
Mateo car were nearly all smashed. Glass
flew in all directions for a few seconds,
but everybody escaped. Both cars were
withdrawn for the dav.
Man-of -"Wars' Men to Race.
There is much rivalry between the men
on the battleships Iowa and "Wisconsin.
The flagship has a boats' crew that has
never been beaten, but the boys on the
Wisconsin think they can pick thirteen
men from the ship's company who can
beat them. A challenge has been issued
and eagerly accepted. The race is to be
rowed in barges manned by twelve men
and a coxswain for $10 an ore. The course
is to be straightaway from Hunters
Point to the battleship Iowa, lving oft
Folsom-street wharf. The officers are as
much interested in the event" as the imn
and much money will change hands on
the result. Both crews are practicing
hard and* the race is expected to be rowed
in fast time.
There Is not a man in the brig on eit'asr
battleship just now. When the President
came here there wers nineteen men locked
up on the Iowa and five on the Wisconsin.
When Secretary Long paid the warships
a visit he released all the prisoners and
there has been a general rejoicing among
the fleet ever since. All the prisoners
were booked for a summary courtmartial
and bread and water would have been
the least of some of their troubles had
they been convicted.
Big Fleet Gets Away.
Nearly a score of steamships, coaster?,
deep-water ships and sugar boats sailed
yesterday. Nearly all of them were ready
Saturday, but a falling barometer kept
them in port. The steamships Ruth and
City of Puebla sailed, taking away a num
ber of gold hunters. The French bark
Francois sailed for Queenstown with a
cargo of wheat, the barkentine Tropic
Bird took away a general cargo for Ta

pressed their sympathies for the men that

TEETH TROUBLES
are generally caused through nejriect in
early life. Teeth relief comes through
the application of our modern
DENTISTRY â -
Our teeth without plates are the most
natural, perfect and lasting. Have stood
the test of years and proved their high
quality. Our prices are based upon that
high quality, but are not high.

Forster. Schulti and Burnell W^d. The
shoot off furnished very interesting Â»t'ort.
Up to the sixteenth target neither Bchultz
nor Ross was credited with a single i'jus,
but the latter let up on his good work on
the seventeenth bird and allowed Schultz
to win out with r clean score. The mem
bers of the San Frandnco Gun Club were
vcrv Jubilant over Schulu's victory In this
event, and attested their Joy by carrying
him off the field in their arms.

for this trophy, but Schultz again won out
with a straight score, which made four
straight scores that he had shot in suc
cession. This record has never belore
been accomplished in any tournament.

which did not dry until the afternoon.
The best match of the day was the spe
cial return contest between George Whit
ney and Frank i Mitchell on one side and
W. B. Collier and Grant Smith on the
other. On Saturday the for^ner beat the
latter team by a very small margin, but
yesterday Collier and Smith turned tha

On Saturday Norman Hodgklnson. rep
resenting Lowell High School, won tha
singles championship of the Academic
League. Roy Taylor ofy Oakland High
School, his opponent in the finals, did not
put in an appearance on Saturday and the
match went to Hodgklnson by default.
That the Lowell man' completely out
classed all his opponents Is shown by tha
fact that he won the tournament without
having played a single match, having won
each match by default This Is the first
time such a thing has happened In the his
tory of tennis on the coast. Lowell, rep
resented by Norman Hodgkinson and Carl
Gardner, won the doubles tournament two
weeks ago, and by virtue of these two
victories she is the champion of the
league In tennis for the present year.
On Thursday, the 30th of May, there will
be a scratch singles tournament, open.
for the championship of San Francisco.
This will be the most Important tourna
ment held for many months, and all the
cracks have expressed their intention of
entering. George Whitney will probably
be the winner, but with Sumner Hardy
entered he will have to play his best.
Flay will be called at 11 o'clock. .

chinists' strike the situation In Philadel
phia is as follows: . Sixty-seven firms out

the nine-hour day basis without a reduc
tion in wages. The machinists employed
by forty-one firms, numbering 2000, con
tinue on strike for a nhie-hour day.
Forty-two firms have not been affected
by the- strike because their - machinists
are thus far Insufficiently organized to

the union officials deem- It practicable to
take such action. .

More happened at Recreation Grounds
yesterday than a baseball gameâ in fact
almost everything but a baseball game.
The players, listless on the field, displayed
remarkable vigor in opposing Umpire
Donohue, and the climax came when
Householder of Los Angeles was escorted
ofl. the grounds by a uniformed policeman.
Householder, the Angel strong hitter,
is a kicker as well. With the stick he
Uijain demonstrated his ability by putting
the ball over the right field fence early
In the game, when Urockhoff and Hutch
inson were doing sack stunts. In tho fifth
inning Householder slid to third, and was
called out. Of course, ho bucked head
foremost against the decision, and
through his persistence was ordered out
of the game. On the benches he sat until
tho eJRhth, when, owing to Kwing'8 weird
nort ot management, thero was no butter
ready, and Husnell wait sent to the plate.
Then Householder shouted aloud:
"You have a nerve to bat, you havej"
This whs tho straw that broke tho pa
tience of Donohue, who ordered Housu
hulder out of tho grounds. The crowd
cheered long and loud, and for the first
time agreed with the umpire. Donohue
resigned after the game, and will be. re
placed by Tyler, a baseball player of ex
perience.
Mosklman started to pitch for Oakland,
and was replaced in tho fifth by Kur^Hl,
who was no bad that Ewlng changed him
for Eabbltt in the eighth.
The game was llstlesd and characterized
by too much s^nd-lot play. In the- il/ili
inning Francks was hurt at eecond, and
was forced to retire.
The Oakland team has been fined $100
for Itv recent action in Los Angeles, when
the nine left before the end of tha game
to cotch the owl train. Repetition of this
will bring upon the malfcasors a fine of
$250. The score:
Los Angeles 5, Oakland O.
Listless Game Won by the
Angels, Who Shut Out

Palo Alto Has the Backing of the Talent, but a Full Limit Course
With Homer Boy in the Semi-Final Ruins His ChancesâDew
drop Beats Bohe for the! Last Flag in the Reserve Stake
FIRST HONORS IN THE BIG
STAKE ARE WON BY SIR PASHA
Geary's dog had to compete with Sir
Pasha in the final. No one expected him
to make a great showing; though he was
well backed slightly under even money.
Sir Pasha got the flag and landed the
rich stake. ; â¢ . â¢Â¦
In the reserve event W. C. Glasson's
Dewdrop beat H. Perigo's Bohe in the
final by a score! of 3 to 2. The runner-up
showed considerable of her old-time stake
winning form and was friendly to the
short end players. Black Flush , took
third money.
The talent had an unsuccessful day. In
tho first round of the class event six of
the ten courses went against the dogs on
which the big:, money was placed, and a
total of twenty-six errors of Judgment
was recorded against tho knowing ones.
Sir Pasha won the â¢ committee stake,
with Palo Alto as runner-up. Dewdrop
beat Bone in the reserve final. The fact
that For Freedom was on the card In tho
big event was responsible, to some extent
for the large gathering, for many of the
patrons were anxious to see the undoubt
ed champion of days gone by put to the
test with some of the younger fast one*.
Homer Boy went to the Blips with the
THE California Coursing Committee
stake of high class coursers proved
a great attraction, and as a result

188""Competition Among Stores at Tread
well Mines Causes a Series of '
Reductions. .
TACOMA, May' 26. â Several merchants
at Douglas, Alaska, have been trying to
secure mine business by starting an agi
tation against the big company store op
erated by the Treadwell mines. State
ments were made that the miners were
being overcharged and yet practically
compelled to purchase of the company.
Manager MacDonald of the Treadwell Com
pany has met this competition by so re
ducing prices that other stores are finding
It difficult to secure trade from the Tread
well employes. Groceries and dried meats
have been placed at cost or below, while
porterhouse steaks are cut to 15 cents per
pound. Coal has been reduced to $7 50 per
ton for employes and $S for others. It is
claimed this price is below what rival
dealers can lay it down for.
At Juneau Captain Ray, manager of the
Cook Inlet Coal Fields Company, an
nounces that he can now supply all Alas
ka with coal. He has nearly finished a
fifteen-mile railroad from the beach at
Homer to the mine.- He Is now arranging
for shipments to Juneau and Skaguay,
and desires later to put on his own line of
steamers.

Austin will tell the story of the shooting
before the Coroner's Jury. Although there
is no other living witness to the occur
rence, every circumstance goes to bear out
the truth of the East> Oaklander's narra
tive of his desperate fight.
There will be an inquest held Tuesday
evening. The action of the Coroner's Jury
will in large measure determine the na
ture of the proceedings against Austin. As
no one has appeared to claim Burnham's
body, the county will have to bear the ex
pense of burial.
The bullet which struck Burnham's left
arm penetrated the left lung. Two bullets
that entered the right side ranged around
the outside of the chest and lodged In the
back. These were the three balls that
were recovered.
The fourth bullet did not lodge in the
dead stableman's body, but passed out on
the left side of the neck, directly opposite
the oolnt of entrance. This wound and
One In the left lung were the immediate
causes of the severe hemorrhage which
caused Burnham's death. That is the re
port which the autopsy physician made to

The United States is not in favor of the
proposed scheme to raise and guarantee
an international loan for China, out of the
proceeds of which she can liquidate her
indebtedness to the powers. The United
States is willing to accept the bonds of
China, without indorsement by any power,
at- 3 per cent interest, and thus make
manifest to the world the sincerity of the
American profession proclaimed at the
very outset that the United States desires
to help China to her feet and preserve her
political integrity.

with regard to scaling down tht J

disappointment, though it could haru.
be said that It was entirely : unexpected.*
The necessities of European cowers for
the maintenance of their large armies
and navies are perhaps a factor in their
present action. The President and mem
bers of the Cabinet feel that this Govern-'
ment was right in protesting against ex
actions which might force China to the
wall and from the position taken by the
United States there will be no retreat.
The demands of the powers are consid
ered exorbitant and likely, if insisted up
on, to result ultimately in the crippling or
dismemberment of the empire. The
United States will continue to urge this
view at every opportunity. If the powers
proceed alone and force China to accede
to their demands this Government, of
course, will accept a share of the indem
nity assigned to it upon the present basis.
It can then distribute such amount as is
necessary to liquidate the claims of our
citizens and subsequently determine, If
such a course be deemed wise, whether all
the remainder should be retained by this
Government as its proper share.

the ride across Nevada is generally ex

which makes all the more pronounced the

The services -At Pleasanton were cele
brated in St. Augustine's Catholic Church,
followed by an open air dinner, a band
concert and dancing during the afternoon.
The celebrations in the other towns were
conducted on the same general .rder as
those at Haywards. They were rJl well
attended and there was much merry
making. ' Â¦
The celebration actually began last
evening but the most significant partb of
the programmes tftok place to-dav. At
Haywards the ceremonies were conducted
under the auspices of Council No. 14, I.
D. E. S. The crown was conveyed to the
new hall of the society and during the
procession there was a dlsplav of fire
works. This ceremony was followed by.
an entertainment and dance. This morn
ing the procession bearing the crown left
ihe HoV Ghost Hall and proceeded to the
Catholic Church, where high mass was
celebrated by three priests. The sermon
was spoken In both English' and Portu
guese. The special singing was contrib
uted by Mr. Finch. Miss Annie Haas, Miss
Annie Garcia and Victor Lagrave. At the
end of the services the procession re
turned to the hall.
The feast of the Holy Ghost, the annual
religious ceremony of the Portuguese,
was celebrated with more than usual
pomp to-day by the people of that nation
ality. It was a great day for them arid
they entered into the spirit of it without
reserve. The towns outside of Oakland
contain nearly all the Portuguese reputa
tion of Alameda, and It was In them that
the celebration was most generallv ob
served.- Haywards, San Leandro, Pleab
anton and, Liver-more all held celebrations,
though In Haywards the most elaborate
preparation had been made.

Stewart Cronin, fourteen years old, a
schoolboy attending the Durant School,
has disappeared under circumstances
which have greatly â¢ alarmed his uncle
and aunt. Mi. and -Mrs. Jeremiah Con
nolly, with whom the missing- lad has
been living at their home, 826 Thirty-fifth
street.
The boy started for school last Thurs
day morning with his books under his
arm as usual. At noon a companion of
young Cronin went to the Connolly resi
dence with the boy's books, saying Stew
art had asked him to return them to the
house and to tell Mrs. Connolly that he
would not be at home for fcis lunch.
Since then nothing has been seen of
the lad and his relatives are nearly dis
tracted, fearing that in gome youthful
PEcapade he might have been hurt so
seriously as to be unable to get word to
his people.
ThÂ« boy Is an orphan and since the
death of his mother, ten years ago, has
been cared for by his aunt. He has no
bad traits, according to the family, ex
cept a disposition to stay away from
school at times. The relatives have
learned that he was absent from his class
without their knowledge for several days
before he dropped out of sight.
They suspect that his sudden lapse
may be due to fear of punishment for
his truancy. At any rate, the boy has
pone and has left absolutely no trace of
his whereabouts. Among some of his
schoolmates he had talked of a desire to
R-o East. The relatives declare they have
no idea how he could accomplish his pur
oose. as he had little if any money when
he went away.

SPREADING RAILS CAUSE
WRECK OF FREIGHT TRAIN
The Brakeman and a Man Who Was
Stealing a Ride Are Crushed
to Death.
PUEBLO, Colo., May 26.â Spreading rails
on the Santa Fe road at Braddon, a small
station eight miles south of Pueblo,
caused a freight wreck at 2:15 this morn
ing which resulted in the death of Head
Brakeman E. J. Washeaton of Pueblo and
J. TV., Holt of Newton, Kans. The, train
was heavily loaded. When the rails spread
the train had reached what Is known as
the west switch and was going at the
usual speed. vVhen the locomotive jumped
the tracks the rest of the train Jammed
down on it and piled nine cars in the ditch
before stopping. "Washeaton was between
the engine and the tender when the acci
dent occurred, and it is presumed was too
slow in Jumping. His right leg was caught
and cut off below the knee. It is thought
that he was injured internally, as he died
at 10 o'clock this morning at the Pueblo
hospital. He did not regain consciousness
after being injured. J. W. Holt was rid
ing under one of the ditched cars. Mem
bers of the train's crew saved themselves
by jumping. .
BATN" DOES DAMAGE
TO CHERRIES AND HAY
Farmers Near Petaluma and Niles
Suffer Severe Loss Because of
Untimely Showers. ) Â» - Â¦! ;
PETAIiUMA, May 26.â The rain that has
been falling here since early last evening
and which continued until this evenins in
showers has been the most destructive in
years. It came when nearly all the hay
in this section Is down and the Cherry
crop is ready for picking:. A half Inch
fell, ; enough to practically destroy the
crop of Royal Â¦ Anne and black cherries
and badly damage all the hay cut. Some
farmers have lost almost the entire pro
duct of their ranches.. There- was an un
usually large crop of hay this year and
on nearly every ranch the loss * will be
felt. .
-NIL.ES, May 26.â It began raining: early
last night and continued intermittently
until 2 p.>m. . The rainfall is .47 of an inch,
making .71 of an inch for the month and
24.53 inches for the season as compared
to 20.02 Inches last year. A large quantity
of nay down throughout the county will
be almost a total loss. The cherry season
is well advanced . but the crop is very
light and badly injured. Growing grain,
sugar beets and vegetables have been
greatly benefited. - /

a life sentence. As he was being taken
from court to the jail he was shot and

If they were notÂ«hang-ed, and It la gener
ally believed that one of the relatives fired

excitement during the voyage from. Santa;
Barbara to Son 1 Francisco by 'attempting
to commit murder and nulctde. ?>. "V k i ;
As soon as the steamship* docked yestei
day; afternoon â¢ Vogel wai ! turned over ; to
the. Harbor Police, who" hurrtwl him gut
to the City Hall where he-wtll^e'held'aij}
tll his sanity has been determined. * '.
When the Queen was ready to ball from
Santa Barbara Vogel was brought abOÂ»M
by his male nurse. He was accompanied
by his wife, who explained that her hus
band was a very sick man and that he
had been In a sanitarium In Southern
California. All went well until early yes
terday morning when Vogel apparently
became violently Insane. He attacked
his nurse and had almost choked him to
death when the people In the adjoining
stateroom heard the struggle and reached
the scene Just in time. Vogel was pulled
off his victim and locked up in" a spare
room. By some means he secured a
razor and made an attempt to end his
own life by cutting his throat. The wound
was not a dangerous one but, but in order
to . prevent any more such attempts he
was put In a straight jacket.
Vogel Is a mem.ber of the firm of Vogel
& Flint, saloonkeepers. 38 Stockton street,
and his home is at 941 Jones street. When
the Queen arrived yesterday a delegation
from the order of United Workmen was
down to meet him. The members of the
delegation off ered " to ' care for the sick
man but when they heard of hla attempt
to murder his nurse and then take hia
own life they decided that the police were
the proper, people to handle him. â¢
Vogel was placed in a cell in the De
tention Hospital, where he imagines he is
being pursued by enemies who want to
kill him. His wife visited him during the
afternoon and came to the conclusion that
it will be necessary to have him commit
ted to the asylum. .She will swear to a
complaint charging him with insanity
this mornins. . . ;â¢..Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
