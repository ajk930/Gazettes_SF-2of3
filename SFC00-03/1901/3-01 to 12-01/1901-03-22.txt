"Moreover, : he agreed that children
should be instructed In . English or

The Government undertook to make no
claim on church property or funds, or
upon hospitals or hospital funds or upon
private Investments. No burgher of
cither state was to be allowed to possess
a rifle except by special license. General
Botha was generally, in favor of - these
conditions, but he dissented strongly from
a proposal to give the full privilege of citi
zenship to properly domiciled and regis
tered blacks. He was also greatly con
cerned about the positon Jewish capital
ists would occupy in the country and was
tcld that Jews and Christians would en
joy equal rights, no distinction being made
in the matter of concessions."
Philip Botha Is Killed.
A special from Cape Town dated March
disputed points could be best settled by
Field Marshal von Waldersee as the com
mander in chief, and General Gaselee. the
British commander, was instructed to re
quest the field marshal to settle the im
mediate differences, reserving for future
examination the question of the validity
of the alleged private rights. General
Gaselee was also Instructed to refrain
from using force except to repel aggres
sion.
Questions of Title Reserved.
On March 20 the alleged removal of the
Russian boundary pillar occurred, and the
Government instructed the British Minis
ter at Peking. Sir Ernest Satow, that
Great Britain was ready to refer the facts
to Field' Marshal* von Walderaee. on the
understanding that if either side was
found to have committed an Irregularity
it should apologize to the other. The
Government added that the construction
of the siding should continue under what
ever conditions the field marshal thought
fit to impose. He (Lord Lansdowne) was
glad to say that he had heard this morn-
Ing from the British Embassador at St.
Petersburg that the Russian Foreign Min
ister. Count Lamsdorff, had proposed that'
they should agree to reserve all questions
of title and proprietary rights for the ex
amination of the two Governments, and
that In the meanwhile orders be forthwith
sent for the withdrawal of the troops of
both sides from the disputed. plats. Great
Britain had entirely concurred, and
thought the withdrawal should be carried
out to Field Marshal von Waldersee's sat
isfaction.
Relations Not Disturbed.
Lord Lansdowne added that Count
Lamsdorfl had expressed a very moderate
and very manly desire to avoid any
cause for friction between the two Gov
ernments, and since the receipt of Count
LamsdorfTs proposal the Government had
ordered the- military authorities to carry
out the simultaneous withdrawal of the
troops to the satisfaction of Field Mar
shal von Waldersee. so that there might
be no room for a renewed misunderstand
ing as to the matters of detail.
His Lordship expressed the hope that
the result of the negotiations over what
was really a very small matter of strictly
local importance would not be allowed to
disturb the relations between the two
countries.
The statement was received with cheers.

were not such as to make his wife believe
that he had any serious trouble to brood
over. The eldest daughter was washing
dishes at the sink when her father went by

CONFERENCE OF DIPLOMATS.
Representatives of Powers Differ on
the Subject of Indemnity.
' "WASHINGTON, March .-21.â A "number
of. foreign representatives: called at the
State Department to-day, all Interested In
China and all - keenly aroused over the
progress of the negotiations concerning
Indemnities.. Among. them was the Brit
ish Embassador, . Lord^ Pauncefote; the
Russian Ambassador, Count Cassini; the
German .Embassador," Dr. von Holleben;
the French Embassador, M. Jules Cam
bon; the Japanese Minister, Mr. Taka
hira; the Belgian Minister. Count Lich
tervelge. Each had separate and rather
long conferences with Secretary Hay.
The Russian view as to indemnities ap
pears to coincide with that of the United
States, being favorable to keeping the
amount down,tn a, sum which there is
some prospect.that China can pay, instead
of placing it so high that China's Inability
to pay will result In a territorial scram
ble. All of the foreign representatives
minimized the/trouble at Tientsin, and
it was not brought up in the conferences
with Mr. Hay, except by one of the con
tinental representatives, who pointed out
that the clash between the soldiers did
not refer to the trained soldiers of the
several powers, but to the native contin
gents from India and Cochln-China. .
\ The Idea of a gross indemnity of $200.
000,000 to be divided into eight parts does
rot seem to meet with approval in diplo
matic 'quarters, as it Is pointed out that
some countries have been put. to far more
expense than ; others, especially in the
matter of moving troops. It is felt by the
foreign representatives that there are spe
cial conditions which will ; interfere with
an equal sharing between all the powers.
TO WITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS.
Lansdowne -Announces , Agreement
Between England and Russia.
Â¦ LONDON. March -21.-Â»In the House of
Lords to-day_ tho Foreign Secretary, Lord
Lansdowne, announced that Russia arid
Great Britain had agreed to withdraw
their troops from the disputed territory at
Tientsin and reserve the question of title
and proprietary receipts for subsequent
examination.
Lord _ Lansdowne supplemented the an
nouncement by explaining that the dis
pute concerned an extensive area in the
left. bank of the Peiho River, which the
Russians . occupied in the autumn and
claimed by right of conquest. Subsequent
ly this Government was informed that
China and Russia had reached, an agree
ment placing the area under Russian oc
cupation. T,he, area, however, comprised
plats belonging to the Northern Chinese
Railroad, and was therefore part of the
security of the British bondholders.
Allies Need the Siding.
The line was part of the railroad re
cently transferred by. the Russians to
Field Marshal ; von Waldersee, who re
transferred it to the British. The necessi
ties of the allies required the construction
of a siding on one of the : plats referred
to. and the presence of British workers
on the ! plat, was treated as a trespass on
Russian \- territory. \ 1 1 .; was \ subsequently
alleged that the Russian boundary marks
had' been removed by/ the British: / In
those circumstances the" Government, on
March 16. telegraphed 'to Its representative
In China' that if thought the rights" of "the
British or' Russian troops - to Â¦ occupy the
dies devout masses against the stu
dents, the intellectual movement and the
factory^ workmen.
The statement that students entered the
church smoking cigarettes, that a student
struck a priest and another student
caught the chief priest rudely by the arm,
are discredited by eye-witnesses.
Driven by Brutal Cossacks.
The fact is that the trouble occurred en
tirely outside the church' until the Cos
sacks pressed 300 persons Into the church
and fought them to the back wall." It is
also doubted that holy .water was used to
dress wounds. The students sent a church
servant expressly for other water. It Is
learned now that the police not only pre
pared for the event themselves, but made
previous arrangements at one of the hos
pitals for the anticipated wounded/They
also had carriages xeady In neighboring
courtyards.
Lectures will hardly be possible for the
remainder of the year at any of the higher
institutions. S-\ ? Vi
The participation Â¦ of the factory hands
In the riots Is considered extremely grave,
so far as the future Is concerned.
It is understood that measures will be
taken Monday. to forestall the possible
marching of laboring men from the su

TIENTSIN, March 21.â Altercations con
tinue here between the French and the
â¢British. An Indian officer of high rank
horsewhipped a French sergeant to-day.
The discipline of the French forces leaves
much to be desired. While the French
officers are evidently doing their best to
maintain discipline, it would not surprise
me to se'e the .French troops get beyond
control at any moment. Already I have
heard of French\soldiers hissing their own
officers, and: it is reported that some
French officers have been stoned In a mys
terious manner, the . missiles coming from
uritraceable quarters. Contingents of Cos
sacks are continually dribbling* In and .'the
Russians have now BOO men more than
they had here yesterday. .
.; Nothing has yet been heard of the ar
rival at the mouth of the river of expected
reinforcements from t Port Arthur and
Newchwang. On the "other hand, it is
reported and believed' here that the Brit
ish fleet Is collecting at Welhalwel: for
the purpose of making a navaldemonstra
tion against Port Arthur.
Contrary to expectations, the day passed
without serious conflict. The Russians,
with the help of between 300 and 400 cool
ies, are building a road along the river In
front of. their concessions.
"This morning the Russian working par
ties stopped- work on the riverside road
when they had reached' a point within

subsequently resumed construction of th6
road at a' point 400 yards farther, on.': The

Missionary Association at Peking that he
recant his attack on several missionaries
which appeared in a recent issue of the
North American Review. It was learned,
however, that the humorist will have
much more to say on the subject In the
April issue of the North American Re
view. "... . .
The Rev. Messrs. Scheffleld, Wherry and
Tewksbury expressed Indignant surprise
that such a man in such a review should
thus slander Rev. Mr. Ament without ex
amining into the facts. Rev. Mr. Reid
said the trouble began because a Peking
dispatch of December 22 on the subject
had been left unrefuted. Ament left here
to-day for the United States. A large
party of Chinese accompanied him to the
railway station.

FRESH EVIDENCE
IN CORDITE CASE
Chamberlain Admits Th
Kynochs Tenders Were
Not the Lowest. '
Lord Chief Justice Interrupts Testi
mony on Irish Members' Coer
i cion by Remarking "You
Pulled the Strings."'
LONDON. March 21.â The King's Bench
Division of the High Court of Justice wa3
again the center of attraction to-day, ow
ing to the hearing of the libel actions
brought against the Star and the Morn
ing Leader by Arthur Chamberlain,
brother of Joseph Chamberlain, and Ne
ville Chamberlain, a son of Arthur Cham
berlain, In connection with charges bear-
Ing on War Office contracts, which are
being heard before the Lord Chief Jus
tice, Lord Alverstone, the defendants
pleading that the articles printed were
not" llbelous and were fair comment on
matters of public lmerest. The cross-ex
amination of Mr. Chamberlain was con
tinued. He declared he had formed the
opinion that the main object of the ar
ticles was to vilify his brother, Joseph,
in doing which they vilified him. Though
the papers one day denied the intention of
imputing corruption and dishonesty to
Joseph Chamberlain, en the following day
they printed something which was more
libelous than ever.
Consulted Joseph First.
He (Arthur Chamberlain) had not com
municated with thÂ«s newspapers before
bringing the action. He had consulted
with Joseph Chamberlain ' and the latter
took legal advice and told him that ndth
ing had occurred on which action was
maintainable. To say. as the defendants*
averred, that the K.ynochs were favored
by the Government was untrue and llbel
ous. Arthur Chamberlain considered that
it would be dishonorable for them to re
ceive favoritism from the Government.
Counsel for the defendants produced let
ters purporting to have been passed be
tween, the Kynochs and the Nobels, by
which the former agreed to keep up the
price of the powder for which the latter
had made a tender to the British Govern
ment. Arthur Chamberlain repudiated ail
knowledge of the letters. Subsequently
he admitted that there had been an agree
ment in 1894 between the Kynochs. Nobels
and Chllworths in regard to a fixed price
for cordite. Counsel read the evidence
given by the Nobels' representative be
fore the Committee on War Contracts to
the effect that Arthur Chamberlain toid
him he had personal influence to secure
contracts.
Saw No Irish Members.
In regard to the cordite contract se
cured for Arklow In 1898. Arthur Cham
berlain said he did not see any Irish mem
bers of Parliament, but got local pressure
put on them by telling the working peo
ple that the shops would be closed unless
the contract was secured. Here the Lord
Chief Justice interjected: "You pulled the
Strings."
Counsel read a couple of letters from
Arthur Chamberlain to the manager of
the Arklow works, urging that local pres
sure be brought to oear on the Irish mem
bers of Parliament and telling the man
ager that William Field, member for the
St. Patrick's Division of Dublin, was
about -to visit the works. The manager
was Invited not to say anything untrue,
but to select tho3a truths which were
most illustrative of the advantages Mr.
Chamberlain brought to Arklow.
On further . cross-examination Arthur
Chamberlain admitted that the Kynochs
secured Government orders for cordite
when their tenders were higher than
others. The case wis again adjourned.

At Mansion House Meeting Declares

LONDON, March 21.â Speaking at a
meeting held In the Mansion House this
afternoon, Lord Rosebery emphasized the
necessity for commercial education if
Great Britain was to successfully meet
systematized competition. He said that
much more than half the foreign policy
of all the intelligent nations of the world
was a commercial society and that the
Incident at Tientsin proved this.
Mr. Choate, the American Embassador.
in moving thanks to the Lord Mayor for
presiding at the meeting, which was held
in connection with the school of economy
and political science, said Americans re
garded such schools as among the means
of maintaining their part in the rivalry
which they were maintaining and meant
to maintain with the sister natons of the
world, "especially with this country.".
Mr. Choate added: "It is a rivalry not
of arms or warfare, but a rivalry of
brains and skill and courage in the great
industries of life."

"I saw the whole affair. The Blumen

passed her near the. banister he put his
arm ' against her "waist and pushed - her
back a step or^so. I called both down,
and, following tho usual-custom, I sep
arated them and had them write an ac
count of all that happened; This done,
I reprimanded them and sent them to
their classes. The matter was , closed."
After passing the resolutions the board
adjourned, like vigilantes who had per
formed a necessary but disagreeable duty.
Indignation runs very high, and the
community is stirred as it never has
been in years past. Sympathy; Is every

count as untrue and upholding Principal
Van Horn. In a written statement hend
ed to the chairman of to-night's meeting
Mr. Van Horn said: /Â¦ â¢

The words were stricken out by a vote.
Indignation* at Fever Point.
Resolved, That a copy of. these resolutions
be sent to eaeh of the San Francisco dallies.
A condition of uneasiness amounting almost
to a reign of terror exists among our people,
lest some trifling Incident may furnish a pre
text for more sensational publications, hold-
Ing them up to public ridicule, humiliation
and disgrace. We know of no reason why San
Rafael should be selected for this kind of
punishment, and we therefore earnestly repre
sent that the time has -come for a .radical
change of policy such as the good sense and
better nature of newspaper managers should
suggest.
We desire therefore to represent to the news
papers and the public that the notoriety which
San Rafael has acquired through the Instru
mentality of the dally press is not due to
any unusual conditions here, but is caused en
tirely by the necessity that the work of our
resident reporters should be. remunerative copy,
and that to this end they have not hesitated
to sacrifice the Interests of our local institu
tions, the reputations of our citizens and even
the fair fame of . our daughters.
Resolved. That we. the San Rafael Board of
Trade, do hereby most earnestly and vigorous
ly protest against the long series of sensa
tional articles that have been published in
the San Francisco dally papers without any
foundation In fact and to the detriment of
the city of San Rafael, .and the business, so
cial and educational Interests of our people.
We see no necessity for -a corps of resident
reporters in a quiet residence community like
our own, and so long as the managing edi
tors of our great dallies are willing to pay
for fake sensations we hevg_ no reason to
expect reporters to refrain from creating the
material upon the sale of which their liveli
hood depends.
Henry Gieske, City Trustee and mem
ber of the Board of Trade, then Intro
duced a set of resolutions. , They were
torrid in their temperature and general
ox against the press. He said that if the
guilty papers were named they would
hound a man for all time to come. The
resolutions were as follows:
Sensations Are Denounced.
After the chairman had finished School
Trustee Dr. W. J. Wlekman â¢ made a
rpeech in the same vein. He was fol
lowed by R. Magnes, who expressed sim
ilar views.. Principal R. H. Van Horn
was present and also addressed the
meeting. He denounced "tho story as a
fake and said that the purported Inter
views in the Chronicle and .Examiner of
the 14th inst. between representatives: of
those papers and himself never took
place.
i "Jsot content with this, an assault was
afterward made through one" of "the pa
pers on the principal. We must take ac
tion to-night and strong action. Our city
is being damaged. The reputations of
men, women and even children are .not se
cure. There was one of the papers that
refused to publish the story. The Call
should be thanked."
"We are assembled 'here to-night to pro
test against the scandalous story that was
publtsned In the -San Francisco Examiner
and the Chronicle, wherein our local High
School was made to suffer. You all read
the story of the little girl, who was said
to have been seized and carried upstairs
by a boy scholar and kissed. The story
was not true. It was brutal.
Protest- of Citizens.
To-night the board met and there were
present -over thirty prominent business
men and property-owners of the cliy.
Their faces. wore a look of determination
and they immediately went to work. The
chairman. Captain Â±1. A. Gorley, .called
the meeting to order and forcibly, stated
its object. He said in part:
Several days ago "the local Board of
Trade issued a call to its members and
prominent citizens to meet and take action
on what is known as the "High School
story." The Call, in observance of its
policy to publish only the truth, did not
prints the story, and the members of the
Board of Trade and citizens publicly
thanked It for refraining to magnify so
trivial an incident to such brutal propor
tions. â¢ t

Dr. Julius Remmson on this subject
savs: Xenons persons, people run down
In health and of low vitality should eat
meat and plenty of it. If the digestion Is
too feeble Â£t first It may be easily cor-
rected by the regular use of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia TaWets after each meal. Two of
these excellent tablets taken after dinner
will digest several thousand grains of
meat, eggs or other animal food in three
hours, and no matter how weak the stom-
ach may be no trouble will be experienced
If a resrylar practice is made of using
Btuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, because they
eupply the pepsin and diastase necessary
to perfect digestion and every form of In-
Cipcstion will be overcome by their use.
That large class of people who come un-
der the head of nervous dyspeptics should
rat plenty of meat and insure its proper
digestion by the dally u*e of a- safe, harm-
less digestive medicine like Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets, composed of the natural
digestive principles, pepsin, diastase, fruit
acids and salts, which actually perform
the work of digestion. â¢ Cheap cathartic
medicines, masquerading under the name
of dyspepsia cures, are useless for indi-
gestion, as they have absolutely no effect
upon the actual digestion of food.
Dyspepsia In all its many forms is sim-
ply a failure of the stomach to dicest food
and the sensible way to solve the riddle
and cure the dyspepsia is to make daily
use at mealtime of a preparation like
etuarfs Dyspepsia Tablets, which is In-
dorsed by the medical Orofession and
known to contain active digestive princi-
ples.

housed while the steamer Belgian King
went to San Francisco to finish dischar?- -
Ing. The certificates presented are al
most identical with those which were pre
sented at San Francisco. He asserts his
belief that the reason of the Chinese com
ing here is the rigid Inspection to which
they have been subjected in San Fran
cisco. He adds that on a recent steamer
but two Chinese applied for admission,
where 200 would have come & year ago
One reason why he is of the opinion
that the attempt to land the Chinese here
is a part of the same wholesale Chinese
landing business la. that since coming hero
he has seen one of the agents of the Chi
nese in San Francisco who attends to such
matters here; and apparently intent on
seeing that the would-be immlgrranta are
safely landed In San Diego slnca they

tion Discusses the Act of the
State's Executive.
The executive committee of the Califor
nia Water and Forest Association has de
cided to issue "an address to members of
the association and others explaining the
effect of Governor Gage's veto of the bill
providing for a commission to investigate
the water supply of the State. This bill
passed both housos of the Legislature,
having only one vote in opposition in each
house. The veto, so the members of the
suBScciation pay, is likely to largely reduce '
the work that the United States Govern- !
ment will do for the State. The associa- i
tlon during the laet year expended 112,000
to extend the work of the geological sur
vey and the Irrigation investigation. Xow
it is out of funds. Secretary Friedlander
eays that the money raised by the ac
tivity of a few persons since the organi
zation of the as.^ociation was devoted to
showing the State what could be done.
The association never intended to engage
in tield work. What was done was an ob
ject lesson and the almost unanimous ac
tion of the Legislature indicated that the
people were favorable to the enterprise
er.d desired to lend the assistance of the
State in the performar.ee of a work which
was only for the benefit of thr> State.
The discussion of the matter took place
at an executive session of the executive
committee. There were no d-nunciations
of the Governor. A member of the com
mittee pays that the talk was "more In
sorrow than anper." Xo draft of the ad
dreFs to be sent out was submitted. A
"committee will prepare something to be
considered some day next week. There
are between MKÂ»n and G*>0 members of the*
association, of whom 3000 live In or near
Fan Francisco. The remainder are In ail
the counties of the Btate.

was then appointed to confer with the
railroad officials to the end that a time
schedule may be arranged* which the rail
roads must keep or pay a" penalty for
every day Â¦ in excess thereof. The matter
of a reduction of rates was also left in
the hands of the ccfmmittee, but'the con
sensus of opinion was that the Important
thing is to secure quick transportation of
the fruit regardless of the freight rates.
Many speeches were made reciting that
freight rates on oranges have been con
siderably increased and that the. time oc
cupied in carrying oranges across the con
tinent had been lengthened from seven
days to twelve and in some cases twenty.
At the afternoon session resolutions
were adopted reviewing, the situation as
depicted above and . mildly scoring the
railroad companies. The resolutions de
clare among other things that the rail
roads have increased their passenger traf
fic by offering special inducements in the
shape of low rates and have taken engines
from the freight service to meet the in
creased demand in the handling: of . pas
sengers, thus causing the freight to suffer.
The fruit men were called to order at
10 o'clock this morning by F. 'Q. Story ot
Los Angeles. George Frost of Redlands
was elected chairman and J. W. Jeffries
'of Azusa secretary. A committee on reso
lutions was appointed and the meeting
took a recess until 1:30 p. m. The mem

growers and shippers from, all over South
ern California assembled here to-day to
discuss the alleged car' famine and the
delay in the transit of fruit to the East.
Hundreds of carloads of fruit, it is said,
are being rejected on arrival a,t their des
tination because of rot. Much of this, the
fruit growers claim, is due to the slow
time made In transit. Thousands of dol
lars have "already been . lost to' growers
and shippers and many carloads of fruit
do not realize the freight charges.

A merry war among the medical men of
this city is promised as a result of the
refusal of the State Board of Medical Ex
aminers to issue certificates to recent
graduates of the Pacific Coast Regular
.College of Medicine. A loud wail rose
from the lips of the graduates who were
refused certificates and the faculty of the
college from which they graduated when
the action of the State board was an
nounced, and now the matter has been
carried to the courts.
J. C. Cowden. one of the graduates who
fell under the ruiing of the board, filed a
petition in the interior Court yesterday
for a writ of mandate to compel the issu
ance to him of a certificate. By w&v- of
Introduction to his complaint Cowden al
leges that the action of the State board is
a flagrant, malicious, outrageous, deliber
ate, wanton and reckless abuse and per
version of power conferred upon it by the
Ftatutes, and was taken for the sole pur-
J>ose of protecting Cooper Medical Col
ege, the College of Physicians and Sur
greons and the Medical Department of the
University of California from the compe
tition of the Pacific Coast Regular Col
lego of Medicine.
Cowden asserts that of the Examiners
l>r. E. T. Frisbie is a member of the
faculty of the College of Physicians and
Surgeons; Dr. B. F. Carpenter, Dr. C. A.
L. Ryfkogel and Dr. James McCone of the
Medical Department of the University of
California, and Drs. P.- K. Brown and C.
C. Woodworth of Cooper Medical College.
These physicians, Cowden avers, refused
him a certificate with the malicious de
sign to injure the Pacific Coast Regular
College of Medicine, to prevent It from
.obtaining patronage and recognition, and
to defraud the college of its corporate
right to exercise its franchise.
â¢ - The action has been assigned to Judg-o
Hunt for trial.

Track Notes.
ANYBODY who thinks Tod Sloan is
the greatest rider In the business
would have been repaid by a
visit to Tanforan Park yester
day, if for nothing more than to
see Dominick straddle Tuthill in the mile
and a sixteenth handicap. 'On Saturday
last at the premature opening of Ingleside
Sloan rode Tuthill with 105 pounds up in
a "special" at the same distance against
Advance Guard, the latter shouldering 125
pounds. Tuthill was a hot favorite, and,
contrary to all expectations, was rated,
or. in other words, ran under a choking'
pull most of the way, while the top
weight cut out the pace.
To be sure, near the close the public got
the English roll and a hot cross bun for
their money, were pleased that Ingleside
was again upon the map, and took the
cars homeward bound. In yesterday's
speed recital Tuthill picked up 102, Ad
vance Guard 127. Joe Piggott, who
rode the last named . horse, his first
mount since being reinstated, was ac
corded a hearty reception. Strangely
enough, Advance Guard closed outsider
of the three starters, Pat Dunne's Star
Chamber, piloted by O'Connor, enjoying
the call. The race was strictly a bewil
dering reversal of form, for, after step
ping off the mile out In front in 1:40%, Tut
hill won, throwing the bit away, and
Dominick looking backward at the hard
ridden Star Chamber, four lengths in his
rear. Advance Guard was as straight as
the City Hall flagstaff when the stretch
turn was rounded. The old-time Pennsyl
vania oil well borer cracked English wal
nuts on the top of a can of nitroglycer
ine, and his relatives are searching for
him still. When Toddy steered Tuthill he,
too, grew careless, and no doubt mis
judged, the pace.
The hot tip on Star Chamber was not
the only happening that gave the talent
cramps, for four other choices strayed
from the narrow path. Rinaldo met with
hard luck at the start, the pedigree of
I The Phoenician became twisted, and Mc-
Namara stopped to pick a bunch of
shamrocks, lllo Chico again caused a
ripple of excitement by taking the third
number at odds of 50' to 60 to i.
Henry, who rode Impromptu, favorite
for the first event at six furlongs, nearly
threw the purse away after having it won.
With Invictus on the rail at hia mercy I
he did not notice O'Connor astride Cougar
creeping up on the outside. When past
the paddock he turned just in time, and
riding hard, again got the favorite's head
in front, receiving the decision by a nar
row margin.
Winnie O'Connor brought in "Doc"
Streett's mare. Dangerous Maid, first for
the six and a half furlong spin. She
closed an even money chance and prac
tically ridden out beat Redwald a length.
Jeria paused for a Jtst after making the
running to the strewn, losing third posi
tion to Our Lizzie. Willie See, could not
make Gibraltar extend himself.
Two noses and a head on the wire, with
Rio Chico receiving the verdict over Ca
tastrophe and Dolore, marked the close
of the seven furlong run which followed.
See put up a very strong finish on the
winner else Catastrophe, plainly the best,
would have scored. There was a mix-up
at the start, in which Rinaldo, the favor
ite, did net get any the best of it. At
that he led into the sretCh, but could not
last out. A few Chinese lottery players
bet a dollar or so on the winner.
Astor. owned by Charley Ellison* who
left some weeks ago for Hot Springs with
a stack of Invictus tickets as high as the
Claus Spreckels building and a bunch of
coin that would send Rip Van Winkle up
into the Catskills again, downed The Pho
enician for the mile selling affair. Nearly
everybody who flattered himself with pos
sessing good sound horse sense put his
checks down on the latter horse and Astor
beat him all the way at odds of 7 to 2.
Vohicer made a very, cheerful showing,
securing the small end of the purse.
Scotch Plaid ran disappointingly.
These unfortunates who backed Mission
on his laet two starts when ridden by
"Pedro" Enos got low and game. With
Mounce up the Imp. Albert gelding came
in aheud of a cluster of fair ones In the
last i ace, beating Mitten and McNamara,
the favorite, four open lengths. There
was a time when Enos, down on the
ground, Â¦was moving lamp posts and briÂ«;'t
buildings looking for reinstatement, and
it might be well to remind the same ridtr
that some of his recent' rides have worn
freckels that a two-dollar sunbonnet
wouldn't hide.

OVERDUE FRENCH BARK DUPLEIX IN A CALM NEAR THE EQUA
TOR. SHE WAS A LOXG TIME GETTING HERE. THE DELAY BE
ING CAUSED BY LIGHT WINDS AND CALMS.
Is More Than One Hundred Days Coming From Australia,
and It Was Feared That the Cargo Had Caught Fire.
More Cases of Salmon Cast Ashore on Oregon Coast
ANOTHER overdue vessel made
port yesterday morning, much to
the joy of reinsurance gamblers.
Tuesday the French bark Du
pleix. 102 days from Newcastle.
Aus., wajs posted among the list of belated
ships and 20 per cent was offered by the
underwriters to reinsure the hull and car
go of coal. The mail boat Sonoma brought
the news that the Star of Bengal had ar
rived at Honolulu with her cargo heated,
and 170 tons of coal had to be jettisoned.
It was this news that gave rise to fear
for the Dupleix. as she was loaded with
the same kind of coal as the Star of Ben
sal.
A'.most before there â¢was a chance to
speculate upon the overdue she put in an
appearance. Still seme few people took
the risk and gathered In their premiums
yesterday. Captain Haraug of the Du
pleix explains his long run by the terse
comment "light winds and calms." For a
week at a time the bark did not make five
knots, and on one occasion she lost
ground.
The chances are that the rate of rein
surance on the British ship Ardnarrrur
rhan will go up to-day. She is now out
"16 days from the Frazer River for Liver
pool, and 50 per tent is offered. A private
wire from Astoria says that more cases
of salmon and also some white-painted
cabin plar.king ore coming ashore on the
Oregon coast. The salmon cases are
marked "C. C. C." the middle "C" being
in a half circle. Salmon cases with simi
l.ir marking came ashore several weeks
ago and were identified as part of the
cargo shipped on the Ardnamurchan. It
begins to iook dnrk for the Britisher.
COMES NEAR DROWNING.
Captain Freese Accidentally Thrown
From the Robert Dollar.
WhUe standing on the deckload of the
Robert Dollar yesterday Captain A. C.
Freeze pot entangled in a guy rope and
was thrown clear across a lumber scow
lyir.p alongside the steamship into the
bay. He was not only badly hurt by the
rope, but was half-drowned before being
rescued. He was sent honse in his buggy
and a doctor called in. No bones were
found to be broken and the captain is
now on the rnad to recovery.
The Robert Dcllar was lying at the Ber
ry-street wharf discharging 400.030 feet of
jumbor for the Hunters Point drydock
into scows. Captain Freese had the con-
Tract for the stevedoring, and paid a
visit to the steamship to see how his men
wore getting along. Owing to a misunder
standing the dor.key engine was started
and the guy rope, catching Captain
Freeze around the shoulders and under
the left arm, iifted him into the air and
hurled him across the scow and ir.to the
bay. Had he been hurled against the
boat the ex-Public Administrator would
have been instantly killed. As it was, he
had a marvelous escape.
Manv Vessels Sail In.
Five of the sujrar fleet and one coal ship
from Australia sailed into port yesterday.
The wind was fair, blowing forty-eight
miles an hour from the northwest, so tug
boats were at a discount. Among those
that got in were the schooner Stanley,
nineteen days from Hana: schooner O. M.
Keliops. eighteen days from Mahukona;
schooner Muriel, fifteen days from Hono
lulu: bark R. P. Rithet, eighteen days
from Honolulu, and bark Martha Davis,
twenty-two days from Hilo.
Whiie the KreneH bark Dupleix took 103
days to come from Newcastle. Aus.. the
German bark Anna covered the same dis
tance in seventy days. The latter also
Failed In. and in dropping anchor off Goat
Inland got foul of the Postal Telegraph
< "ornpany's cable. The tug Detiance
tteraed her and moved her to a safe an
chorage.
Sailing Dates Postponed.
The transport Pak Ling was to have
sailed for Manila yesterday with 750
horses for the Eleventh Cavalry. As it
cvrs blowing hard from, the northwest
Â¦jutsiae yesterday it was decided to post
pone the Bailing until to-day.
The Oceanic Company's Australia was
2ue to have got away for Tahiti yester
iay at 2 p. m.. but the cargo could not be
rot aboard, so the sailing was postponed,
jr.tii 5Â« o'clock this morning. The Austra
ia will take away fifteen cabin and thirty
steerage passengers for Papeete.
The Mail Company's City of Peking,
Krhich was scheduled to sail to-morrow
r or the Orient, will not get away until
rucsday, the 2Cth. owing to a flaw In the
:ub of the propeller.
Accidents on the Front.
William F. Lee, an employe of George
\Y. Caswell & Co.. was nearly killed on
Lhc front yesterday. He was driving a
buggy when the horse ran away along
Kast street. He crossed through all the
cable and electric cars at the foot of Mar
ket street, but collided with a butcher's
Â¦waRon near Howard-street wharf. Lee
was thrown out on his head and rendered
unconscious. At the Harbor Hospital It
v.es fcur.d that he was badly bruised and
hud a bad lacerated wound of the scalp,
but was otherwise all right.
Harry Morris, a salesman for an up
town house, fell overboard from Clay
street wharf yesterday. He was rescued
by T. Carter, the boatman, and was none
the worse for his duckine.
Water Front Notes.
The transfer of the Klmball Steamship
Company's fleet to R.cbert Dollar has lit
tle or no significance, as the same people
v.lll handle the vessels and there will be
really nothing but a cangre of name. John
S. Kimball retired from the concern that
b^ars his name nearly eighteen months
Â£go.
A walking delepute from the stevedores*
union tried to call out the men at work
on the ship Lucille yesterday. Some of
the men belonged to the union and some
did net. The latter are anxious to become
union men. but as there are two unions
they do not know which to Join. Captain
I3er.nett discussed the whole matter quiet-
Jy with th- walking delegate and his em
ployes and agreed to have all the men
objected to Join the union as soon as the
opposing factions settled their differences.
Max KailFh, the popular manager of the
Humboldt Steamship Company, came to
town yesterday. He starts for Puget
Sound next Sunday.

clde because he '. had no hope . for the
future. -:. Mr. , Kuhl Â¦Â¦Â¦ endeavored Â« to cheer
him and: suggested that he become an In
mate of the Almshouse, where he could
pass the remaining days of hJs life in
peace without being haunted ' by ' the . fear
of* Â¦want and Â¦where his wife : could rejoin
him should she recaver , from her illness.
Captain Harrington agreed,, and on
Wednesday afternoon Mr. Kuhl took him
to the home for the moneyless and had
him regularly, installed as an Inmate. -At
that " time Captain Â¦ Harrington had $1 60,
his total earthly possessions. , At 5:35 yes
terday :morning: the? inmates of ,the ward
1A ' which { the captain slept â¢ were startled
by the sound of a postol shot and saw the
old mariner; writhing in his bed. He died

It is not worth while going over the whole list, but
some of the items may be noted. Mattituck harbor,
ir. New York, received an appropriation of $5000.
The place is thus described in the report: "This har
bor is a tidal inlet extending about two miles south
from Long Island Sound to the village of Mattituck,
on Long Island; the natural depth of water at the
entrance is from one to two feet." An appropriation
of $12,500 was given for the improvement of Trinity
River, Texas, and the leports of engineers show that
the stream "has a depth at its mouth of three and a
half feet at mean low tide"; " that to "improve" the
stream it would first "be necessaryto cut down and
remove all timber along the banks"; when improved
the waterway would open up navigation to Liberty, a
village of 700 inhabitants. There was an appropria
tion of $10,000 for the Altamaha' River, in Georgia,
and the reports declare: "The chief obstructions to
navigation consist in rock ledges, sandbars, snags,
sunken logs and overhanging. trees."
â¢ Such are some of the specimen items which Carter
His speech was long, but not too long for the sub-'

bors for which appropriations were made he has fur

vided for its members and their constituents.
WHEN Senator Carter marked the close of his
career in Congress by talking to death the
river and harbor bill he inflicted much injury
upon the country, but he also did some good. He
put a sjop to many improvements that arc of great
importance, and for doing so has been justly con
demned; but it is to be borne in mind that hj
slaughtered a good many buncombe jobs along with
the needed improvements, and is entitled to credit to
that extent.

Designs From the Erie Canal.
Pitcher of the War of 1812.
The Erie canal was opened during his
visit, and many of the plates printed to
commemorate, that opening bear medal
lion portraits of Lafayette. Those Erie
canal plates, of which seven designs are
known, are among the most interesting of
our historical plates. The canal was, to
quote from one of these plates: "A splen
did monument of the enterprise and re
sources of the State of New York. In
debted for its early commencement and
rapid completion- to the active energies,
pre-eminent talents and enlightened pol
icy of De Witt Clinton, late Governor of
the State." On these varlou% canal plates
may be seen a view of the capltol grounds
at Albany, one of the aqueduct bridge at
Rochester, of the canal at Buffalo, of the
aqueduct bridge at Little Falls, of the
canal at Albany; also smaller
views of canal locks and portraits of Gov
ernor Clinton, JefTerson and Washington.
During the tour of Lafayette there was
given to him on September 18, 1824, a re
ception in Troy. N. Y.. at which was used
a very remarkable pitcher, now owned by
Horace Jones Richards of Troy and
known as the "Historical Pitcher of the
War Of 1812." It was made about 1S24 by
Enoch Wood & Sons of Burslem. Staf
fordshire, by the order of Horace Jones of
Troy, N. Y. It stands twenty inches in
height and is eighteen inches in diameter
and holds eleven gallons. It is decorated
with a border of green and copper luster,
with portraits of Washington, Adams and
heroes of the war of 1812â Captain Jones of
the Macedonian, Major General Brown of
the Niagara campaign. Commodore Bain
bridge of the Constitution, Commodore
Decatur, ' Commodore Perry and Captain
Hull of the Constitution. It has also
prints and, views of Commodore Macdon
ough's victory on Lake Champlain. Com
modore Perry's victory on Lake Erie, the
Constitution escaping from the British
fleet and the engagement between the
Chesapeake and the Shannon, also pa
triotic emblems and and the historic mot
to, "We have met the enemy and they
are ours." This pitcher is a monumental
example of American triumphâ and Brit
ish indifference to sentiment.
Other Bare Old Pitchers,
I have seen a pitcher with a portrait of
"John Adams, President of the United
States"; another with a portrait of John
Hancock, one with Samuel Adams, one
entitled "Death of Montgomery" and one
"Death of Warren." A design known as
the "Proscribed Patriots" is rare. It has
portrait medallions of Samuel Adams and
John Hancok and the motto, "The mem
ory of Washington and the proscribed pa
triots of America. Liberty, virtue, peace,
justice and equity to all mankind.- Co
lumbia's sons, inspired by freedom's flame,
live in the annals of Immortal fame." - On
the front of the pitcher is the inscription.

It should be made clear that the public sentiment
of San Francisco is opposed to track gambling, no
matter at what place or under what management.
There has never been any question of personality in
the content so far as the supporters of morality are
concerned. Their sole interest has been the welfare
of the community, their sole motive that of protect
ing the public against the vices of track gambling and
the crimes that follow. Let that truth be made clear
on Monday afternoon. Let the supporters of the veto
be present at the meeting of the Supervisors on Mon
day and see to it that the final action of the board on
tbe matter be a complete victory for morality.
It has been charged in some quarters that the fight
against the scheme to legalize gambling at Ingleside
was prompted not so much by a detestation of the
evils of gambling as by personal antagonism to the
men who sought the privilege. ' The charge could
never have had much weight with intelligent people,
for among those who were foremost in supporting
the cause of morality were men of high repute in the
business world, pastors of churches and others whose
characters are beyond the reach of slander. Never
theless it will be worth while to refute the charge ut-
Hrly by making the fight against gambling at Ingle
side under the new management as vigorously as U
was made when the track was in the hands of other
parties. Consequently The Call urges all who have
acted with it in the controversy to show themselves
as earnest as ever in the good cause.
While there is thus nothing in the situation to
cause any alarm among the opponents of track gam
bling* in this city, they should not overlook the im
portance of the Monday meeting. Once more there
should be a demonstration of public sentiment
against the toleration of gambling. The men who
have been earnest and faithful in making the fight
for morality from the start should attend the meet-'
ing and renew their protests against the proposed
wrong. They should again make clear to the Super
visors the force of the objections to gambling and
strengthen the hands of those who will sustain the
veto.
There is hardly a single cause for fear that the veto
will be set aside. The men who voted against the
ordinance in the first place can be counted on to vote
against it again., and several at least of those who
voted for the ordinance in the first place have had
reason to change their views upon the subject, so
that it is likely they will on Monday either vote to
sustain the veto or abstain from voting.
rIKAL action in the prolonged contest over the
ordinance permitting bookmaking and pool
selling at Ingleside track will be taken on Mon
day. On that day the Mayor's veto will be sub
mitted to the Supervisors and a vote will be taken
upon the question of passing the ordinance over it.
If the veto be sustained the long controversy will be
brought to an end by a complete victory for the
people.
SUSTAIN THE VETO.
The long residence and great popularity
abroad of Benjamin Franklin account for
the many ceramic relics relating to him
which are now in existence. They are
richer and more varied even than those
of Washington, yet few appear on artl
cies in daily use, such as Staffordshire
table services. The design known as the
"Tomb of Franklin" Is common enough;
It is a -rich, dark blue print of a pedestal
inscribed "Franklin," surmounted by an
urn bearing an illegible inscription. By
the side of the monument .sits the figure
of a man reading, which is popularly be
lieved to be intended for Lafayette. This
design is seen on dinner, tea and toilet
services. Occasionally the "fun cap por
trait" is found on Liverpool bowls and
pitchers; and a set of dark blue plates
Perhaps the two most popular Washing
ton designs are what are now known as
the "Monument" design and the "Apothe
osis" design. Both commemorate the
death of Washington; one Â¦with conven
tional monuments. Inscriptions, urns,
weeping willows and mourning figures;
the other with Time lifting Washington,
robed, in a shroud, from his open tomb,
while an angel holds the patriot's hand
and points upward to rays of glory. This
is from an old engraving advertised In
Philadelphia newspapers In 1801 and some
times still seen In Philadelphia homes;
and hideous enough it is, and absurd also.
The various decorations owned by Wash
ington, including the Order of the Cincin
nati, hang conspicuously over the open
dcor of the tomb.
Two Other Washington Pitchers.
A design which â¢ would appear to be
earlier In manufacture, but which has no
definite date, bears a portrait of Wash
ington mounted on horseback, with an In
scription, "His Excellency Gen. George
Washington, Marshal of France and Com
mander in Chief of the North American
Continental Forces." Washington, In a
letter to the poet Lamont (who had ad
dressed him by the French title of mare
chal). wrote in 1875: "I am not a marshal
of France nor do I hold any commission
or fill any office whatever under that Gov
ernment." Still, - it is universally stated
that the French at Yorktown addressed
Washington as "Monsieur le Marechal."
The oldest dated pitcher which I have
seen with a Washington design bears the
date 1796, and is known as the "map pitch
er." â¢ It has a medallion inclosing a very
curious map of the United States, showing
thirteen States). On this map Louisiana la
called the "Country of Mines" and
stretches up to Lake Superior. Washing
ton and Franklin are gazing at this map,
while two fair dansesâ Liberty and His
toryâare gazing with equal lntentness at
the heroes. In the sky a winged Fame, a
favorite emblem of the day, is blowing
a trumpet and flourishing her heels in
clo?e proximity to. the august head of
Washington. This print is seen on bowls
and pHchtrs, and is sometimes accompa
nied with a key giving tbe names of the
figures. The pitchers are always of what
is known as the watermelon shape, once
so popular In Liverpool ware,. now practi
cally obsolete. - : -

also thirty or forty more designs In tha
form of medallions, statuettes and other
costly forms- of ceramic art, on- which we
will not now dwell. The Liverpool pitchers
and mugs, decorated with transfer prints

Washington designs. .<,;.â¢Â¦-;
Imperialism might save Austria for a time, but that
would be only a postponement of the inevitable.
Throughout Europe i here is a marked desire to re
construct the' political map so as to make national
boundaries correspond with the habitations of races.
The Germans of Austria wish to be a part of the em
pire of their fellow Germans, the Slavs desire to be
united with other. Slavs. Aspirations .of that kind
when cherished by strong races are almost certain to
win in the end. A reconstruction of the map o(
Europe is therefore by no means an improbability,
and the establishment of absolutism at Vienna. might
even have the effect of hastening it. .
Korber is reported to have stated that the efforts
now being made to conduct the affairs of the empire
through the Reichsrath would be the last attempt un
der the present constitutional system, and he warned
the opposing factions that "outside the Reichsrath
there is a governing power in Austria able to enforce
its lawsand protect its empire." Furthermore, there
is a story that the Emperor himself 'ihas told M.
Javorski, the leader of the Poles, that this will be the
last constitutional means his Government, will em
ploy. /These reports may be exaggerated, but the
very fact they are circulated is ample evidence that
there exists in. Austria a party â¢ favorable to abso
lutismâone which will cordially support the Em
peror if he put a summary end to the faction fights
in the Reichsrath and restore order.
Is it surprising that under such circumstances the
Prime Minister should think seriously of closing
Parliament, establishing a military government and
by providing work for the people rally to the sup
port of the Government all the laborers and conser
vative elements of the empire?
Such declarations from men chosen to carry on the
legislative branch of a constitutional Government do
not augur well for the future of that Government.
When one set of men frankly assert a desire to be
incorporated into the empire of Germany, and an
other into the empire of Russia, it is evident that
neither of them can be safe legislators for Austria.
It is to be noted/moreover, that at the very time the
dialogue was going on in the Reichsrath a large body
of unemployed men was outside of the doors of the
building shouting, '"Down with the Czechs!" "Down
with the Pan- Germans!" "Down with Parliamentl"
"Give us work!"
* Herr Silenzâ Austria has not gained any advantage
by her alliance with Germany, â¢* but she might profit
much by a rapprochement with Russia.
Herr Stein â Say openly that you -wish to belong to
Russia. â¢
Herr Silenzâ We remain good Austrians.
Herr Steinâ Anybody remaining a good patriot now
adays in Austria is a fool.
Herr Stein retorted; "The German Emperor Is right.
I declare openly that we wish to join the German em
pire."
To this Ilerr Silenz replied: "That Is why the Ger
man Emperor recently said he hoped to establish a
great northern kingdom on the Elbe."
The recent proceedings in the Reichsrath have cer
tainly been sufficient to justify such a declaration.
The strife between Germans and Czechs has gone
beyond the point of wrangles and rows and reached
an open declaration of a desire to dissolve the em
pire. A report from Vienna of a debate in the
Reichsrath between Herr Silenz, a Czech leader, and
Herr Stein, a German,. says:
Herr Silenz taunted the Germans with squinting: to
ward .Germany, whereupon Herr Stein shouted:
"We do not squint; we look. We wish to go over to
Germany, as you do to Russia." .
\A ANY predictions have been made that the Aus
/ \ trian empire will be involved in civil war and
break to pieces shortly after the death of the
present Emperor, therefore it is not surprising to
learn the statesmen-of the country are making prep
arations to meet whatever crisis comes. One among
them, the Prime Minister, Dr. von Korber, is re
ported to have had the boldness to speak out con
cerning the preparations that are being made,. and to
have given warning that if the empire cannot be held
together by the present constitutional Government a
resort will be had to the army and imperial abso
lutism.

V.â PITCHERS OF OUR GREAT GRAND-MOTHERS.
One of the curious and incomprehensible
side issues In our history is the immediate
subservience made after the revolution by
the English of patriotism to commercial
ism. The victories of the American colo
nies had hardly taken place when English
potters set to work to supply the Ameri
can market with pottery and porcelain,
decorated with designs relating to the
glories of Washington, Franklin, La
fayette and other revolutionary heroes.
These potters had none of that patriotic
pride which would prevent them from cel
ebrating and perpetuating the virtues and
victories of their late enemies, or even
hinder them from printing inscriptions
and verses Insulting to their native land
and their fellow countrymen; they were
plainly, mercenary; the United States
made a vast and lucrative market. Â»
The great American who was "first in
war, flrs*t in peace and first in the hearts
of his countrymen" was also first on the
pitchers of the English potters. There are
over twenty -designs relating to General-
Washington now known printed on Staf
fordshire and Liverpool wares. There are
with illustrations of Franklin's prowess
is entitled "Franklin's Morals."
" Designs Relating to Lafayette.
I have never seen any pieces of English
pottery bearing the name or portrait of
Lafayette or any reference to him that
could be assigned to an earlier date than
1824. the time of the Marquis' triumphal
visit to America. There are ten or a
dozen views and portraits of this date that
are well known to all china collectors.
The great veneration felt J or Lafayette's
character, his universal popularity, and
the enthusiasm over his visit, contributed
to produce- the great numbers of these
commemorative pieces which were
brought to America, and also- to their safe
preservation to this day. The two superb
views of La Grange, the home of Lafay
ette, were manufactured by Enoch Wood
of Burslem, and the fascinating "Landing
of Lafayette at Castle Garden," made by

the art of the British potter of that day.
The portraits of Lafayette which are

very ugly and mean. Indeed, he 'was JitJt

IT is interesting to observe the trend of Southern
sentiment and expression as to the President
Several Southern States were 'represented at the
inauguration by formations of their National Guards,
and others were present by their Governors and
staffs. Among the latter appeared Governor Longino
and staff of Mississippi. The Governor of the Fire
eaters took his place and bore his part creditably in
the parade, mixed with his Northern brethren and had
a good time, contributing also to the same kind of a
time enjoyed by others. Then he went home to be
immediately attacked by the press of his State, in
some cases as bitterly as if he had gone to Boston to
lay a chaplet on the grave of Wendell Phillips and
eat baked beans, with pie for breakfast
To some extent the Mississippi idea seems to be
that the North is a foreign country, inimical to the
State of Jefferson Davis, and that her Governor must
not foregather, nor march, nor take bite and sup with
the outside barbarians. No amiable person in f the
North will object to. this idea that Mississippi is an
American Korea, a sort of hermit State, not yet
opened to the world. It adds to the gayety of nations,
and in these flat and even, four square and common
place days contributes to the national amusement.
Seen from the practical standpoint it would be bet
ter for the States and the Union if the Governors of
all the States would attend the inauguration of Presi
dents and seek other and more frequent opportunities
for getting together. In the States we have conven
tions of county Sheriffs, and of members of Boards of
Supervisors. Even the Mayors of cities all over the
Union have conventions, exchange ideas about muni
cipal government, discuss measures of betterment and
reform, and go home. refreshed, if not wiser and bet
ter. Why would it not be a good idea to have an an
nual executive convention, composed of all the Gov
ernors and presided over by the President of the
United States, to discuss constitutional forms of gov
ernment, develop the analogy and parity of laws, and
decide upon a common code between the States to
cover the matters of extradition and divorce?'
While Mississippi is laying the lash on Governor
Longino for straying so far from home and, as some
of the more grandiloquent put it, "dragging the cap
tive Democracy at the chariot-wheel of a Republican
conqueror," in other parts of the South a different
frame of mind is shown.
Of course the border States do not share the fire
eating appetite, but it is surprising and gratifying tha:
the Ultima Thule of the South, the southest South
that continental geography will permit, Florida, shows
in regard to the President and the North a normal
temperature, unfluttered pulse and a cool, moist skin.
Perhaps this" is because Florida knows the value cf
the Northern market for early garden truck and
values the presence of the Northern tourist who ar
rives chilled to the marrow and remains to thaw out,
fish tarpon and shoot alligators, with much gain to
the local capital.
Whether the reason is material and sordid or in
effable and patriotic, the Florida press seems to enjoy
entering the den of Northern lions and playing with
their teeth and claws, as if to show Mississippi that
it is not afraid.
The leading Florida paper, the Times-Union, has
published a really remarkable editorial estimate of
President McKinley, which may impress other parts
of the South. . .
After explaining that Southern Democrats threw
Mr. Cleveland and purposely opposed and embar
rassed his administration because he had policies
opposed to what the Democracy wanted, the editor,
praises President McKinley because he has gone with
his party and stopped when it laid down the law, and
preferred rather, to obey the will of the people than
to blaze out a path for himself in the wilderness ot
new conditions. As to expansion it is declared that
he could not prevent it, and would have wasted his
strength in struggling against the irresistible current.
So this Southern writer concludes that the history
of Cleveland and McKinley proves that the people
want to govern themselves, and want to make mis
takes in doing it, bark their shins, so to speak, in
spite of Presidential warnings.
As to the Democratic minority this significant
statement is made: "On leading issues Republicans
have so divided that a decided stand against the ma
jority made in determined fashion by the minority
would have reversed conclusions, but the Democratic
opposition refused to stand out, as did' Republicans
against Cleveland. For this failure the Democrats
are responsibleâ he who does not oppose accepts and
indorses."
That will do to keep in pickle until the next cam
paign. It is an admission by high Democratic author
ity that that party in Congress has really indorsed
the measures of the administration and that its oppo
sition has been intended to be perfunctory and not
real and effective.
After all is said and sung, however, let us be thank
ful that Mr. Cleveland was better than his party, for
it makes a deal of difference what kind of a party it
is when a President tries to be better than it. His
claim to the gratitude of his country rests upon the
sort of party he had. With McKinley it is different.

first edition, printed at Strawberry Hill
In 1757, with numerous important SIS.

This volume was purchased at Daniel's

Caricatures to be sold are also very nu

Another new novel which Is sure to be

popular success. He la now Very busily

will deal with what Is considered an In
teresting period in early English life.
It Is stated that more than one English
publisher Is seriously thinking of Invading
America and starting business In the
United States.
It is true that some years ago thÂ«
amount of business done by English ptfb
llshera in America was comparatively
small and that an American branch house
was often an unprofitable enterprise, but
of late the sale of books has been so
gigantic that more than one English pub
lisher during the last twelve months has
mode more out of bis American business
than out of business this side the At
lantic.
The American colony In London has be
come so large and important that it has
been found necessary to prepare a direc
tory of Americans in London. This has
been a long felt want and will be gladly
welcomed when published.
One of the most striking collections of
books which have come under the ham

of the collection Is exceedingly varied,
notwithstanding the fact that a few of its
most desirable articles have been be
queathed to public and private Institu

It contains many extra, illustrated books
and collections of engravings. For in

"Byron's letters." etc.. extended to
twenty quarto volumes by the addition of
2S0O portraits, views and the like; a copy
of Camden's "Britannia." 1772. with near

therefore, that out of the evil results of his action
some good will come. It will of course be always
necessary to have log-rolling to get an appropriation

Senator Carter in commenting upon the appear
ance.of so much jobbery in the bill said: "It appears
ridiculous, utterly absurd, wholly indefensible from
any standpoint whatever. It is an unhappy condition
of things to contemplate when we are brought Â¦ face
to face with the fact that the harbor of New York,
with its majestic commerce, the harbor of San Fran

around the country, upon which the nation at large
depends for incoming and outgoing commerce, can
not b$ honestly improved without filtering the public

are appropriating to blush in the act when the facts
are brought before them."

Government was expected to make a channel for
ocean vessels to the village of Mattituck out of a tidal
inlet whose , waters are only, two , feet deep, to open

hang their channels and so shallow that even at their
mouths there is a natural depth of water hardly deep
enough for a good-sized fish to swim in.

sensible of tha proud privileeo accorded mÂ«
by the chairman In assigning to me the agree
able duty of saying a few words of welcome
to our honored The present occasion
does not call for any Verbal pyrotechnics or
gems of thought. We are all, I take it, al
most too intimate with Tom Williams and
ourselves, to throw "bouquets" at him or at
each other. It seems to me you would all
be better pleased if I limit my remarks to ex
pressing our pleasure at having him with us
this evening as our guest. He Is not going
to- leave us to selfishly enjoy his new-found
happiness. He proposes to remain right here
among us and he expects us all to be wit
nesses of his felicity. He has proven by re
cent events that he is great in war and I am
sure he will be great In peace. As a result cf
the war, he should settle up and as a result
of peace and happiness he should settle down.
"We cannot separate tho two who, - in a few
hours are to be made one, and so I propose
the health of the brido and groom, to be
drunk in bumpers.
The toast was quaffed with right good
will, all the gentlemen standing while

The facts remain, however, that the lit
tle flat is vacant and that David Ferrier
and his baby boy are living with hla
mother at 1S03A Folsom street and that
none of the Ferrier family know of the
whereabouts of the young wife.
Another said that the man was a fur
niture . dealer who had purchased the
household effects, wliile others said that
she never had a brother and that the
alleged furniture man was some one
dearer to her than the man who dealt in
household articles.
The people In tho neighborhood of 1321
Minna street supplied many additional
facts. One said that the young wife was
assisted to move by her brother, with
whom she went away.
"Yes, my son's wife packed up every
thing last Monday while he was at work
and has gone, we know not where," said
Mrs. Ferrier.
The grandmother of the child, who is
a refined and well-educated French lady,
admitted the troubles of her son and
daughter-in-law and \ said she had the
baby in her possession.
The mother sought the child some weeks
ago and recovered It. Since then there
has been constant trouble between the
husband and wife, which resulted in the
sudden separation. Â«â¢
The couple had been married about'
three years.;- Mrs, Ferrier, who was a
Miss McNally, is a tall, handsome blondo,
about 20 years old. It is alleged that some
time since she neglected her baby and
household for outside pleasures and tha
society of other men. As a result the hus
band took their child and placed It in the
care of his mother, Mrs. Ferrier, a widow
and teacher of languages, at 1803A Folsom
street. > "
When David Ferrier, an engineer em- j
ployed at the Union Iron Works, returned
from his work last Monday evening he
found that his wife had sold the furniture
and' levanted. Their two-year-old baby
was the only occupant of the otherwise
desolate home at 1321 Minna street." %?Z-'.

Mrs. Hennessy, after parting with her
money, has been compelled to work In an
overall factorv to nipport her children.
One daughter is married, but another and
a. snn are dependent upon her. Her hus-
V>and died fourteen years ago and by her
r-xertions she has since maintained her
family.
"That would be compounding a felony
to see her." said Alicri and another search
for bondsmen was uade, but it proved
lutile.
"Can't you go and see this woman? See
how much she wants; give her anything
Fhe as^ks. but get me out of here. Won't
any of my friends go my bail?"
"This is a case of blackmail." said Ful
ler. "I do not know anything about it.
"What is the charge anyway?"
Turning to his attorney, Mr. Allen, he
paid:.
Nearly nine months elapsed from the
time I eaw him last until I located him
cut his residence, 502 Stanyan street, where
his wife keeps a rooming-house. I went
there several times, but failed to meet
him. His wife always answered the door.
On February 27 I get word to him and on
March 2 he called on me, promlsincto re
turn all my money. He was very much
agitated, denied that he was married and
asked me to wait fcr a few days. Then
I consulted Attorney Nagle. who sent a
formal demand to him. to which he paid
no attention. After avoiding me for near
ly a year I thought, after taking my at
torney's advice, that it would be better
to send him to prison than to compromise
with him."
Fuller made an attempt to resist arrest
when Officers Waterman and Bunner
raught him. He lives directly over the
Stanyan street police station. "Waterman
and Bunner were in a lot adjoining the
rear of Fuller's residence attending to the
patrol wagon horses. Fuller appeared on
the back perch and Waterman, knowing
thcrÂ«Â» was a warrant for his arrest, called
to him.
Fuller obediently responded, but when
Waterman placed Lim under arrest he
tried to break away. Bunner then Jumped
over the fence and helped to escort him
to the station, where he was formally
charged. He was immediately sent to the
Hall of Justice and was locked up in de
fault of tsm bail.
He eald he had an estate coming to
him from the East, but needed money to
carry on the fight for Its possession. I
save him various sums at various times,
In all over $1000.
In December, 1S25, Mrs. Hennessy, with
her four children, left her home In Char
lottetown. Prince Edward Island, and
soon laaded la San Francisco. She located
In & lodrinr-housa at 617 Mission street
and was Introduced to Fuller by the land
lady. Fuller at this time was suing: his
wife for a- divorce. Mrs. Hennessy being
a Btrantrer told him tnat she had a draft
xrem the bank In her home town that she
wished cashed- Fuller, ehe claims, of
fered to have it cashed and learned at tha
came time that eho had some other re

Â¦was very attentive to her financial affairs
end In order that he might be in better
"posltiou to handle her moneys took her
before Notary Thorpe and had her ac
knowledge some sort of an Instrument.
Out of a remittance of more than $300
Mrs. Hennessy received about one-half,

A railroad man of good education is

ident Benjamin I. Wheler decided that

railroad officials their advice as to how to
get a 'good 'man to fill tho bill. Wheeler's
action was not crowned with success, and
how gently he was let down is not known."
It is said, however, : that he has now- an
impression that railroad men are, besides
being busy, high-priced.

ticipated In with deep sincerity. The
punch bowl was filled with sparkling
liquid and circulated around the room,
and for some hours the gentlemen con
versed. When they dispersed It was with
a heartfelt wish that Tom Williams and
his bride would enjoy for many years the
acme of happiness.
The bowl presented to Mr. "Williams Is
of massive silver with a heavy raised rim
of vine leaves and grrapes top and bottom.
The inside is heavily gold-plated. The ex
terior bears the Inscription: "Thomas H.
Williams Jr.; From His Friends," and
the date of the presentation. The donors'
names are engraved around the bowl. It
is a fine piece of workmanship, from the
hands of Shreve & Co. The ladle is of
the old Dutch type, the handle bent al
most to a right angle at the point where
It touches the bowl: . The handle proper
is a silver owl, the Bohemian symbol.
The total weight is seventy-five ounces,
of which the bowl weighs sixty-five and
the ladle ten.. v "
It was understood that there should be no
speeches to-night and so I will give you my
thanks for this kind expression of your re
gard for me. This Is not a farewell dinner,
as many have supposed. It Is tbe most hos
pitable reception I*have ever had in my life
and all I can say is that I hope that my
better, half' Is a million times better than' I
am. I trust that I shall be able to Invite
you all to my home. Once again I thank you.
As Mr. Oelrlchs concluded his remarks
the club attaches brought Into the room
the superb work of the silversmith's art,
â¢which was then presented to Mr. Wil
liams amid cheers.
With visible emotion Mr. "Williams ac
cepted the gift and said: f - :'.
I will conclude my remarks by asking the
honored guest's acceptance of this punch bowl,
which I beg he will accept with the best
wishes of those whose names are on It 'and
with every possible wish for his future happi
ness. Â¦ - ..-".. - , .
Toastmaster Oelrlchs then resumed his
speech and raised hearty laughter by fe
licitous comment upon each gentleman
present. The merry manner of the
speaker then gave way to a serious vein,
and, continuing-, he said:
they drained their g-oblets of sparkling:
wine.

NEW TOnK, March 21.â The heavy selling
by speculators to realize, which carried the
whole irarket down yesterday, was checked to
day, and there were renwaJ recoveries and a
showing of net gains for the day In a majority
of cases. There was continued pressure on the
ci&rket at the opening of buslnesc and lt was
emphasized by the depression In the London
market on account of uneasiness over the
Tientsin affair and fears of harder money there.
But there was renewed buying of some stocks
of such proportions and conducted with Â«uch
confidence as to discourage the selling, and the
rubscquent rally was helped by the demand
from quite an extended short Interest left un
covered after yesterday's operations for the
decline. The speculative leaders were very
active in their efforts to cause a resumption
of the etrong bull market which has recently
prevailed. They were only partly successful,
although they had the assistance of a report
late in the session that the Anglo-Russian diffi
culty had been settled. A number of stocks
were falriy buoyant during the day and others
were markedly etrong, but the advances were
not all well held and there were frequent reac
tions after the recovery had set In. Burlington
was In demand from the shorts and there was
a combined upward movement at one time In
the Grangers. Pacifies and Southwesterns.
Heavy realizing met this advance and difficulty
was encountered, especially In the case of Mis
souri Pacific, in upward course. The Eries were
the conspicuous feature of the later market and
were lifted from 24 to 7 points, the latter the
eecond preferred on enonnous buying. Recently
current reports of early dividend action wen
all revived. The Wabach securities were In
good demand, the preferred rising 1\ over last
night. The movement In the Erie* helped all
the coalers. Sugar shot up 2*4 points and Peo
ple's Gas and Tobacco had their periods of
strength. The International Paper stocks were
very strong, rising 2>Â»Q44 for the common and
preferred. Salt gained l'i and the preferred 7.
There Â»u quite a lonr list of minor railroad
stocks which moved up i'rom 1 to 4S. and North
American advanced 6Â»i over last night. Amal
gamated Copper was strong on the regular divi
dend declaration. The steel stocks were de
cidedly quiet and moved narrowly, but recov
ered to some extent from early *heav1ness. Not
withstanding, this quite Impressive showing of
strength there was no renewal of the universal
upward movement which .affected the whole
market at time* during the last few days. That
there Is some latent uneasiness over the money
outlook is shown by the eager discussion of the
poesibllty that the Secretary of the Treasury
will redeem Government bonds and thus benefit
the money market.
The railroad bond market continues very act
ive, many new issues coming Into prominence.
The price movement was Irregular. Total sales,
fS.255,000. United States refunding 2s advanced
Â»Â» and the old 4s declined \k per cent on the
last call.

CHICAGO. March 2Lâ The provision market
opened strong on light hog receipts and higher
prices at the stock yards, May pork 15@20c
higher at $17 07i517 10. Selling by brokers said
to be acting for Armour, who Is popularly be
lieved to be In a position to control the mar
ket, started realizing by other longs and- May
broke on an excited market to $16 20. Armour
was an open buyer of ribs In the meanwhile,
his purchases' bein& approximated at 2.000.000
pounds. This, together with the readiness of
the market to absorb pork at the decline, caused
a gradual reaction In May pork to $16 45. The
close was E5c under yesterday at $16 S3. May
lard closed a shade up and ribs C@7>,ic higher.
Armour Is still believed to control the market
and some traders took the long side of the
decline.
Wheat was only moderately active, trade be
ing chiefly of a professional character. At the
opening yesterday's rumor of a clash between
the Russian and English troops at Tientsin re
mained unconfirmed. Easier cables from Liver
pool were In line with the supposition that
the report was either unfounded or exaggerated.
Northwest receipts were liberal and in addition
to this bearish array ot facts the Price Cur
rent estimated the wheat In farmers' hands
fit <6,000,000 busfiels more than the Government
approximation, and the warehouse stocks at
47,000.000 bushels more than appears at the
points- of which the official visible supply state
ment takes cognizance. May opened Uc lower
at 76ftÂ®76%c, eold to 7634c dipped to 76^c
and recovered to 76-\c. In the afternoon May
dropped again to 76Hc. closing heavy, %c un
der yesterday at 76V4ia76Hc.
Corn was moderately active, while the un
dertone of the maiket seemed easy. May
closed %c lower.
Oats were dull. May closed Me ldwer at 24TÂ»c.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

i The Prune market grows brighter every
day, and it really appears as If the long de
pression were over. Stocks In the East are
reported smaller than for years at this sea
son, as will be seen In. the flrst column, and
inquiries are being received from all over the
East. If the present demand keeps up there
will be no desirable Prunes . on hand when
the new crop comes in, but there will prob
ably be a quantity of small and Inferior
stock, though this will not compete seriously,
with fresh, large fruit. It is by no means
improbable that we may have a good Prune
market this coming fall, after all.

Arata is a son of Andrew A. \ Arata,
who does the teaming for the firm of
Gray & Barbieri, 309 < Washington street
He and Victor Cassirielli. a cripple, had
been teaming together for some time and
were always friends. Yesterday at the
noon hour Arata, after his lunch, was tak
ing a nap on top of some empty sacks at
the Washington strtet store. Cassinelli,
in a spirit of fun, began throwing empty
boxes and sacks at him to keep him from
sleeping, which maddened Arata and he
jumped up, seized a piece of scantling
four feet long by three inches broad and
struck Cassinelli a vicious blow on. top of
the head with it, rendering him uncon
scious.
Cassinelli was taken to the Harbor Hos
pital and from thero to the Emergency
Hospital at the City Hall, where Drs.
Bunnell and Armstead trepanned his
skull. It was found that a large clot of
blood had formed on the brain, which
would, if not removed, cause his death.
The fracture extends clear from the fron
tal bone to the base of the skull, leaving
him one possible chance out of a hundred
to recover. He remained unconscious
after -the operation, which adds to the
uncertainty of his recovery. Â¦Â¦
The police were notified and Detectives
Dlnan and Wren were detailed on the
case. They arrested Arata on Sansome
street and locked- him up in the. "tanks",
at the City .Prison, pending developments.
He did not deny rtriklng Cassinelli on
the head with the piece of scantling and
said he was sorry that he 'had injured
him.- They were always friends, he said,
but Cassinelli threw the boxes and sacks
at him which made him mad. Arata is
only 21 years of age and Cassinelli Is three
years older. , Â¦ * - '-,
James Arata, a teamster. Is detained In
"the tanks" at the City Prison and the
probability is that a charge of murder
will be booked against him. . . / V

RESULT OF BLOW
Chester M. Griffin, who halls from
Yreka, complained at police headquarters
Tuesday that he had been bunkoed out
of $97 50,' In what is known as the "plate
game," in a shed attached to, the phono
graph parlore on the Ocean boulevard, be
tween A and B streets. He stated that
he and a friend had visited " the place
Tuesday and he soon dropped his money
and his friend also lost about $24.
The modus operandi of the game is to
pitch five brass plates at a red circle with
the object of covering entirely the circle.
Grftfln got Interested in the game, b'ut
steadily lost, and he alleges that the men
in charge" of 'the game deftly moved tho
plates when he had a chance of winning.
Detectives Dillon and Crockett went out
to the Ocean Beach yesterday and arrest
ed the proprietor of the game .and four
others. They are Frank Marshall, J. D.
Brooks, H. Kenny, Bert Alburn and Ed
ward Williams. Marshall, Brooks and
Kenny were booked at the City Prison
on a charge of grand larceny and the
other two for vagrancy: The officers
seized the paraphernalia and closed the
place.- * . .. :. '
About half an hour after they had been
booked on the Griffin charge, Carl Goertz,
1159 .Mission street, appeared at ! the City
Prison and on his complaint Marshall,
Brooks and : Alburn were booked on an
other charge of grand larceny. He played
the plate game Monday and soon, parted
with - $68. x He alleged that Alburn delib
erately altered the plates on the circle so
as to prevent Its being, entirely covered.
The Â¦ men " were : soon released on bonds.
It Is claimed that they hold a license to
play the game .and that they cannot be
convicted under any of the city ordi
nances. They denied that there was any
trickery, as alleged. The men played the
game and lost fairly.
â¢ The game is played on Kearny street
every < day, and Tuesday night a police
man asked , the advice . of â¢ the Â¦ warrant
clerk as to whether the proprietors of the
games could be arrested and was informed
there was no ordinance to cover the case.
A similar attempt was made two or three
years ago without, success, i ' *: , .

Puts Big 1 Force of Men to "Work Re
ducing Width of City Hall
Avenue.
The Board of Public Works received In
formation yesterday afternoon- -that
George T. Marye was suing out a writ of
injunction to prevent the narrowing of tho
roadway on City Hall avenue by four feet
on each side. Immediate orders were
given to Chief Field Deputy McGilllvray
to put every available laborer in the
Street Department to work tearing up the
basalt blocks and placing new curbing
along the avenue. .This was done in or
der to escape the service of the Injunction
Commissioners Mendell, Maguire and
Manson went their several ways, but a
force of fifty men began operations at 4
o'clock and by 6 the work was nearly
completed and the injunction, which
was issued late in the afternoon
by Judge Dunne, was of no ef
fect, as there was no one to serve it on.
The work was done at the direction of the
Beard of Supervisors with a view toward
beautifying- the avenue with Ebade trees.
Marye and other adjoining property own
ers objected before the Street Committee
and the Mayor and the matter was re
ferred to the City Attorney. - That of

ular and the work was prosecuted with
renewed vigor when it became known that
Marye was getting out a restraining or

Judere Fritz will not render his decision
<r>n the charce of forging the seal of a
court of record till this morning, and It
nay be favorable to the defendant, which
Â¦would render that portion of the writ un
necessary.
In ' the aprrtlcatlon for the writ the
Vlaim Is made that the complaint charg
ing Cooper with forging a telegram
did not state sufficient facts to con
stitute a crime and the evidence did
rot ?how reasonable, probable or any
cause to hold the defendant to answer for
nny crime. The instrument wasÂ» not such
that the crime of forgery could be predi
cated upon, it is claimed. It Is also
claimed that a woman's consent to her
marriage or her affections were not such
rroperty that the law contemplated could

could have fceen no intent to defraud any
Person or anything which would render
the defendant liable to punishment for
eny crime.
In regard to the charge of forging tne
peal of the "High Court of Chancery, Lon

a telephone message was sent for a pri

physician who accompanied it announced,
that Curnow had been dead for some time.
Rigor mortis had set in, tending to show
that Curnow was dead when first discov

The only evidences of injury were found
on the hands of the deceased. Both of
them were burned and blistered and sev

dynamo. Whether Curnow stumbled and
in trying to save himself from falling
threw out his hands and touched the
dynamo or carelessly placed both hands
.on the electrical generator while examin

When his hands touched the dynamo the
circuit was completed and the entire

I will not reopen the matter. As I said in
my statement of Wednesday evening, the in
cident is closed. When Mr. Scannell said he
would race any horse in the world for any
number of heats from seven to twenty, I took
him at his word. It was immaterial to me
how many heata there were in the race. I
would have been willing to race three or five
heats if he had so stated at first, .but when
he said he would race The Abbott four In
seven I accepted that offer. When he talked
with me over the telephone this was perfectly
understood. " Then when my representative
was ready to sign the agreement objection
was made to four heats in seven and he was
told that ThÂ«y Abbott would not be. raced four
heats In seven. Now I do not do business In
that way. When I give, my word I keep.it.
and when Mr. Seannell announced that I he
would not race The Abbott as he had agreed
to, then, as far as I was concerned, the race
was off. Under no circumstances will I take
up the matter againâ no matter, in what form
it comes to me. â¢ .

flesh sticking to a 4000-volt dynamo gave
mute evidence as to the cause of death.
Curnow had been in the employ of the
company a short time. It was his duty
to oil the general operating machinery
and the dynamos. He went to the dynamo
room about 3:30 o'clock yesterday morn

on the ground floor. It generally took him
abcut fifteen or twenty minutes to refill
the oil cups of the dynamos. When ho
failed to return half an hour later L. A.
Eaton, the foreman, went upstairs to look
for him. He found Curnow lying on the
floor in front of a dynamo that when fully
loaded generates 4000 volts of electricity.

uer Holland, It says:
' "The general conduce of the Coroner's
office under L. T. Holland has been very
tad and such as to bring scandal upon
the office and disgrace upon the county of

been actuated not so much by a purpose
to- perform the important duties of his
office faithfully and well as to subserve
certain ulterior purposes to punish ene
mies and reward friends, and altogether
to secure the utmost profit for somebody
out of the corpses that have fallen Into
his temporary keeping."
Another paragraph in the report has
this to say:
! "Not disparaging the skill of physicians
or surgeons of the County Poor Farm or
County Hospital and of the physician In
charge of the free dispensary, we are of
the opinion that the. superintendents of

Not TJp to the Usual Mark, Many
Well-Known Artists Not Being
Represented.
The forty-third spring exhibition at the
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art opened last
evening with a reception to members of
the Art Association. A musical pro
gramme â¢was rendered under the direction
of Henry Heyman, and was much enjoyed
by those present.
With this exhibition a new plan will be
inaugurated. The principal exhibition of
the year has before been held in the au
tumn, but It has been decided, in conse
quence of contiguity of dates with the
winter exhibition of the Bohemian Club,
to make the spring event the important
artistic function of the, year at the Hop
kins Institute. The fall exhibition will in
the future be confined to the slitrwing of
pastels, watercolors and specimens of the
various black, and white mediums.
Tho exhibition Is not quite up to the
usual mark in point of Interest, many
well-known names, including. those of A.
L. Matthews, C. J. DIckman, R. Lang
try Partlngton, H. Stuart Fonda, Evelyn
McCormick, T. Welch and others, being
unrepresented. The exhibition Is also
smaller than usual and the pictures ex
hibited are comparatively unimportant in
point of size and subject. There is a con
siderable dearth also in the domain of
portraiture.
Mary Curtis Richardson has two charm-
Ing pastels, the head of a child and a
brilliant little/portrait of a lady, than
which is nothing better In the exhibition. ,
William Keith is represented by three im
portant landscapes. Theodore Wores has
a portrait of W. Greer Harrison and an
ambitious Japanese figure subject. B.
M. Robin'son has a true and subtle bit of
color in a view of the Golden Gate.
Eugene Cadenasso has three. landscapes,
one of considerable Interest, though hard
ly up to the high level which this artist
has lately set for himself. Annie Frances
Brlggs has some charming Dutch water
colors,, pleasing in composition and strong
in color. . '
J. A. Stanton shows some specimens of a
now process of color etching, one of which
has the rich and pleasant tonÂ© of old en
graving, plus the color. C. P. Nellson
shows some Monterey sketches; L. P.
Latimer, an ambitious landscape; Sara B.
Gamble, the portrait of a lady; J. J.
Baumgartnor, a couple of watercolors, dis
tinguished by various kinds of unworth;
J. M. Campbell, a landscape with cows,
and Clara Curtis three* large watercolor
sketches.
Lucia K. Matthews has a clever child
portrait and a number of charming llttio
landscape and genre subjects and Louise
Schwamm has a good collection of
sketches. â¢ â¢"Â¦.-.â¢Â¦â¢-
G. F. P. Plazzonl has a richly toned
studio subject and a distinctively Gallic
landscape. The three H. C. Best Hand
scapes show marked advance, and C.
Chapel Judson's "Reflection" is a strong
color study. . Â¦

All these roads but the four latter had
representatives at to-day's meeting. The
meeting of the representatives of the au
ditors la being held in the Her Grand

To-day the rules, as they havo been de
vised by the general passenger agents,
were taken up and dlscused ln detail.
Fourteen roads are in the proposed asso
ciation, as follows: The Atchison, Burling
ton and Missouri River, St.. Paul and
Omaha, Colorado and Southern (except
north and west of Denver) ; Fremont, Elk

OMAHA, March JB.-r^Representatlves of
ten railroads operating In the territory
tributary to Omaha "are in session in
Omaha arranging the details for the new
Passenger Association, which Is designed
to Include fourteen railroads ln this ter
ritory. , The men here are the represen
tatives' of the auditors and they are pro
viding for the handling of the joint ac
counts which will arise with the estab
lishment of the association. Thi3 new as
sociation has asked the Western Passen
ger Association to take it ln ag^ a branch.
Should the reply be ln the negative it will
ask for admittance in the Southwestern
or Transcontinental Association. Should
it be refused by all it Is said it will become
independent. â¢ Â¦ . â¢
Some opposition to it was expected be
cause of a plan it has for a new mileage
system, to which the other associations
object. This plan is that script books
will be sold, the paper of which will be
exchanged for tickets at any of the ticket
offices in the association's territory-

"The' Messlnas weighed forty-six
ounces; the weight of the pulp, seed and
rind was thirty-three ounces and tho
weight of the Juice was thirteen ounces.
The seeds numbered 185. The percentage
of the weight of Juice in the California
dozen was 3C and of the Messina dozen
28.3. Taking this test as a basis, a box
of California lemons would weigh 450
ounces avoirdupois and the Juice would
contain 26.64 ounces' of crystallized citric
acid. The* box of Messinas would weigh
325 ounces and the juice would contain 19.7
ounces of crystallized citric acid.
"Another test of California lemons and
of Messinas took place in January last at
Cleveland, the chemists being Benton,
Myers & Co. There were 300 Messinas and
300 * .California lemons. The Messinas
weighed seventy-one pounds five and a
half ounces and the Califomias seventy
seven pounds six and a half ounces. The
free acid in the Messinas weighed two
pounds three and a half ounces and in the
Oallfornias three pounds three ounces.
This made the percentage of free acid in
the Messinas 3.11 and ln the Califomias
4.12. Then. the Sicily lemon dealer had an
analysis made in which he claimed that
the percentage of citric acid in 300 Mes
sina lemons was 8.58 and in the Callfor
nias only 6.5S. He undoubtedly realizes
the death struggle that the Messinas are
about to have, and is doing his best."
"The Messina lemons have been beaten
twice in fair chemical tests by the Cali
fornia fruit and there is no reason to ex
pect anything but victory for California
in any unprejudiced trial. The present
situation grows. out of an advertisement
that an importer of Messina lemons pub
lished some months ago, in which he set
forth that California lemons had little or
no citric acid, very little Juice, and were
comparatively worthless. After that ap
peared, a test was made of Messina and
California lemons, by Stlllwell & Glad
ding, chemists, at New York. The show
ing was strongly in favor of California.
Twelve Messina and twelve California
lemons were the basis of the test, these
being of the size of 300 to the box. The
twelve California lemons weighed fifty
ounces. The seeds and rind and pulp
weighed thirty-two ounces and the Juice
weighed eighteen ounces. The total num
ber of seeds was forty.
The fruit dealers of this city say that
the Eastern man who has ?500 to hazard
on the outcomo of any fair test will not
havo to wait lohg to find out "where he
Is at." B. N. Kowley, who has been keep
ing a close watch of the progress of the
California lemon, said yesterday:
A very Interesting event Is ahead. The
Italian Chamber of Commerce of New-
York and the Fruit Buyers' Union of New
York are about to have a chemical analy
sis made of Sicily and California Iemon3
to determine which variety . ha3 the
greater percentage of citric acid, and
which is the superior. Some individual la
making the offer In behalf of the Sicily
lomon growers to give any one $500 who
can show that the California lemons are
superior. The truth of the matter is that
the California lemons have taken away
the trade territory of the Eastern States,
west of the Alleghanies, on 'their merits,
from the Sicilians, and the rival citrus
fruits are now engaged ln a death strug
gle for the mastery of the field on the At
lantic seaboard, which Is the only fight
ing ground left in the United States for
the Sicilian fruit.

de Seviglia." "The Barbiere" in 1816 be
longs to Rossini's earlier period. "Don
Pasquale." written ln 1S43 (over a quarter
of a century later), belongs to Donizetti's
latest. Note also that "The Barbiere"
was written for Rome; "Don Pasquale"
for the Theatre Italian In Parisâ that Is.
for a decidedly more sophisticated audi
ence. The difference in style between the
two works is even greater than the dif
ference ln dates and places might sug
gest. "II Barbiere" is frankly an opera
buffa of tho very purest, type; it has all
the characteristics of the genre, and none
other. The styie of "Don Pasquale" Is
more mixed. Starting out as a pure opera
buffa, it dips now and then into senti
mental opera of a rather Hotel Rambouil
let type. Then the orchestration is far
greater than in Rossini's work, a circum
stance which of itself takes a little out
of the opera buffa vein. The old recita
tive secco, too, in replaced by accompa
nied recitative. There is -an enormous
amount of line melodic intention, but the
comic element stands forth '.frankly and
the -sparkle " is that of diamonds.- The
quartet "E Rimasto la Impietrato', 1 is' a
decidedly elaborate piece of writing, yet
is carried through with a very firm hand.
I know nothing else in which Donizetti
has shown such real musicianship. It is
a finer piece of work than, the sextet "in
"Lucia, quite as full of inspiration and
far more. distinguished in style and work
manship. The serenade "Com e Gentil"
has long been famous; the duet between
Norlna and Malatesta. ~ "Pronta io Soni"
is one, of the very best of, Us genre. The
character drawing is capital throughout.
An occasionar touch of sentimentallsm, a
fondness for , luscious-. thirds and .sixths,
indicates the composer, whose real forte
was opera seria, who could not quite rid
himself' of his . habitual Â¦;, manner Â¦Â¦Â¦ when
i writing opera buffa. ,_ - -
MADAME SEMBEICH
To Raappear Saturday Afternoon.
Madame Sembrlch has entirely recov
ered from her recent Indisposition and will
reappear Saturday afternoon at Morosco's
Grand Opera-house, when for the first
time in many years Donizetti's "Don Pas
qualc" will be produced. It was originally
given "In evcnJn? dress." that is, not so
much in the costume of the period (1843)
as in dress suits and a ball dress through
out, as if it were a salon bluetto acted
without costume. This plan has generally
been followed since, though Madame Sem
brlch and company dress in Louis XV
period.
"Don Pasquale" is surely Donizetti's
masterpiece in opera buffa, and it is in
teresting to compare It with Rossini's
young worcAir victim

Last night Mrs. Esplnoza visited police
headquarters and gave the detectives,

list of the property stolen. It consists of

rings, a pair of diamond earrings, one

The police are anxious to find Julia
Gonzaletti, a handsome Austrian girl, who
ia wanted for stealing diamonds and Jew
elry valued at more than $2000 and $500 in
money from Mrs. Cspinoza, by whom she
was employed as a servant. Mrs. Espin

street. They arrived here from Guate
mala a short time ago, bringing with them
an Indian girl, whom they had reared
from infancy. Two weeks ago Mrs.
Esplnoza engaged the pretty Austrian to

roll of greenbacks, which -was secured by
the thief.
"I am satisfied that the crime was com
mitted by the servant." declared Mrs.
Esplnoza. "Notwithstanding thÂ© fact
that she had been strongly recommended
to me, I had a suspicion that she was not
altogether honest. After I discovered
that my room had been entered and my
diamonds and money taken, I looked for
her, but failed to flnd her. It seems that
she left the house immediately after com
mitting the robbery and has not been
seen since."
The .detectives who are working on the
case think that the girl is in Oakland and
every effort is being- made to apprehend
her.

Pbr-rt addresses of welcome. Among
those present at tho dinner were:
j President Jordan of Stanford told of the
great spread of education and the
changes that are now going on through
out the country. "The extension of higher
education," said he, "means more than
many people now realize or appreciate.
The day is fast approaching when the col
lego men will rule America."
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of
Berkeley spoke humorously of the great
pleasure it afforded him "to meet a man
v.*ho is held' responsible for everything
that goes wrong In the community, for
misery loves company," he concluded.
In responaing to the speech of welcome
Professor Hadley said that he had long
looked forward to the time he would be
able to visit California. After detailing
the work accomplished by Yale within the
past decade he outlined the programme
arranged for ,-the bi-centenary of the
founding of the college. He told of how
the courses of study had been remodeled
and that departments of music, forestry
and ranitary engineering had been added.
He lurther said that the academic fac
ulty was studying to get a substitute for
GrÂ«-ek. "Yale," said he. In conclusion,
"still remains a domocratic institution.
No ono better understands than do her
stvdents the value of the student fra
ternity that has always marked the col
lege's existence. The spirit of loyalty is
to-day as great if not greater than ever
before."
The address of welcome was delivered
by "William Mayo Newhall, who then In

Judge Hayne in closing spoke but a few
minutes and the court then took the mat
ter under advisement, it being understood
that an early decision would be handed
down.
Justices Van I>yke. Garoutte and Mc-
Farland frequently asked Attorney Mc-
Cutchen whether it was not a fact that
the water company sought to restrain th?
Oakland City Council from performing the
duty imposed upon it bv the Legislature.
In reply Mr. McCutchen read many de
cisions to show that the Council could
be restrained from performing its duty
Â¦when it was known that the act to be
performed would be &n illegal one. The
decisions, however, \all referred to aces
of various, legalized bodies, which had
been performed, tho carrying out of which
would be illegal.
Supreme Justices Ask Questions.
Mr. McCutchen claimed that the lower
court alone had jurisdiction In that mat
ter- He further argued that the supple
mental complaint was part, of the pro
ceedings of the original suit brought by
the water company, and that Judge Hart
had every right to allow the filing of ths
second complaint and Issue the injunc
tion.
Judge Hayne argued that the lower
court had no right to allow the fllinsr of
the supplemental complaint and that
Judge Hart had no authority to Issue an
injunction against the City Council. Judge
Hayne contended that the trial Judge had
been called'in solely to try the suit aris
ing out of the act of the Council In fixing
the water rate for the last year and that
he had no power to interfere with any act
of the Council as to the proposed rate tor
the ensuing year.
The entire contention of Judge Hayne
was that a new cause of action could uot
be made in a supplemental complaint, and
he quoted many decisions on the point.
Attorney McCutchen In behalf at M:e
water company, and Judge Hart, the re
spondent, claimed that the act complaineJ
of was the act of the court and not that
of the Judge who presided. The attorney
argued that the Supreme Court had no
power to pass upon the merits of a sup
plemental complaint or say whether or
not It should have been filed.
Judge Hayne, for the city of Oakland,
made a short but forceful argument yes
terday. He claimed that after the filing
of the suit on October 4 of last year, by
the water company and pending the de
cison of the case, the company had In
jected an entirely foreign matter into the
litgatlon by filing the supplemental com
plaint, that was the basis for the injunc
tion Issued, on March 14. The latter com
plaint aJleged that the City Council of
Oakland was biased and unfair and was
about to pass another water rate ordl
naifce. For that reason Judge Hart had
granted the injunction.
Claims Judge Hart Acted Illegally.
Chief Justice Beatty presided and Jus
tices Van' Dyke, Garoutte, McFarland
and Harrison were also on the bench.
Judpro R. Y. Hayne and City Attorney \V.
A. Dow appeared for the city of Oakland
and Attorneys E. J. McCutchen and A. A.
Moore represented the Contra Costa Wa
ter Company and Superior Judge Hart,
tho respondent In the proceedings.-
The Supreme Court, Bitting In bank, yes
terday heard arguments upon the alterna
tive writ granted a few days ago In the
Oakland water rate case, by which Su
perior Court Judge E. C. Hart of Sacra
mento was called upon to answer why he
not be enjoined from acting: tin the
Injunction granted by him to restrain the
City Council of the city of Oakland 'from
fixing water rates for the ensuing fiscal
year.
