EDY. MAJOR SILVESTER HAS . INSTITUTED . A FAR-REACHING
MOVEMENT AGAINST ANARCHISTS.
One of Edison's best X-ray machines
and his most skilled and trusted oper

The batteries were charged and the ma

Thus far the bullet, which is still in
the body, gives the physicians no anxi
ety; but if the slightest inflammation
appear ir. the region of the lead it will
be immediately extracted. ; No difficulty
is expected in this regard.
Yesterday one of the doctors thought
forty-eight hours would be the limit of
the danger from that source, but his
more conservative colleagues believe at
least twenty-four hours, possibly thirty
six from this time, must elapse" before
the possibility of peritonitis shall have
vanished. That disposed of, still other
complications may arise. Blood-poison
ing may set in or an abscess form where
the bullet is imbedded in the muscles of
the back.
And yet, despite all this optimism,
the President is by no means out of
danger. None of his physicians, not one
of his advisers who is admitted to the
inner councils, has the temerity to go so
far as to declare that he is. But if he
continue to improve for one day more
the danger of peritonitis, which is most
dreaded, will have practically disap
peared.

continuously, remained 'steadfastly
throughout the day in the little white
walled tents across the street from the
house where the country's patient lay
and flashed the news over the land and
the sea.
Dr. Charles McBurney. the famous
New York surgeon, who had been sum
moned in consultation, after a thorough
examination in which he said he had
found not a single unfavorable symp
tom, joined in the last afternoon bul
letin, which declared that the President's
condition was satisfactory to the physi
cians present. It is not strange, there
fore, that the Vice President, the mem
bers of the Cabinet and other distin
guished \-isitors who called came away
with lighter hearts and buoyant tread
and gave expression to the most optim
istic sentiments.
Not the slightest premonitory symp
tom of peritonitis appeared and the
fresh hope born with the morning grew
stronger and stronger as the day ad
vanced, until toward evening the con
fidence expressed in the President's re
covery seemed almost too sanguine.
2JO TJNTAVOKABLE SYMPTOM.
The developments of last night and
to-day were dreaded, but hour after hour
passed and the distinguished patient,
struggling there beneath the watchful
eyes of physicians and trained nurses,
showed no unfavorable signs. Five
times during the day the doctors and
surgeons assembled for consultation
and each time the verdict was unani
mous that what change had occurred
was for the better.
BUFFALO, Sept. 8.â Through
this quiet, peaceful Sunday
every word that came from
the big vinedad house in
Delaware avenue, in which
the stricken chief magistrate of the na

and to-night the chances for his recov

those who have kept the patient vigil

The encouraging news spread over
the Exposition City with great rapidity
and thousands came in carriages, in
street cars and afoot to learn for them
selves of the faith and confidence that
existed about the Milburn house. The
brightness of the day, with its cool,
bracing atmosphere, added to the gen

newsboys darted into the crowd about 6

KAISER SENDS SYMPATHY.
Later Secretary Cortelyou took , oc
casion to emphasize this very: point by
issuing an official statement assuring the
public of the complete trustworthiness
of the bulletins sent out by. the physi
cians. Senator Hanna came agairijiir
ing the afternoon and was seldonwar

BULLETINS TRUSTWORTHY.
All day the members of the Cabinet
and others associated with the President
in public life came solicitously and went
away almost jubilantly, all reflecting the
hopeful outlook at the Milburn house.
Vice President Roosevelt received the
earlier bulletins, and, after going to
church, hurried to the residence. There
he was joined by Senator Hanna. They
came away together and gave expression
to .the most confident and encouraging
sentiments. The Vice President not
only shared the cheerful feeling, but was
extremely optimistic. Both gentlemen
took occasion to denounce in unmeas
ured terms the statements gaining circu
lation in some quarters that the doctors
were not frank in their communications
to the public. They maintained that the
President's favorable condition was even
understated by the physicians, through
motives of conservatism, during the
seventy-two hour period.. . .
To-day also, for the first time, nour
ishment was administered. It was in
liquid form and was injected hypoder

ritating the walls of the stomach. The
exterior wound was dressed this morn

tween 9 and 4 o'clock he had the solace
of natural slumber for about four hours,
and the physicians stated 1 officially that
his sleep had been "quiet and reposeful"
and had helped the sufferer a great deal.

â¢The Cabinet officers feel it to be their
duty to be. here in this crisis -to meet
any emergency. They are holding no
formal meetings, although there are
some matters of public business which
they daily discuss . informally, and the
possible contingencies should the Pres

canvassed. They - do not believe that

gether- about - noon, and, indeed, there
was no time during the day when some
member. of the Cabinet was not in the
house where his stricken chief lay. Even
those most, prominent in public life did
not see him, as the doctors would not
relax the ironclad rule . they have laid
down to. prevent the least drain upon
his energies and vitality. Those who
came and went moved silently and rev
erently, receiving, the latest statements
from the doctors and departing:. All of
the members of the, Cabinet are here ex
cept Secretaries Hay ' and Long. \ . The
former telegraphed to-day that he would
start from Newbury to-morrow and
would probably be here to-morrow
night. Secretary Long telegraphed that
he was coming but did not specify the
time. â¢ ', \ Â¦
"Speaking as a surgeon," he said, in
effect, "and disregarding for the moment
the personality of the patient. I would
say that to me his recovery seems al
most as certain as anything human can
be. Let me explain: ' ,\ If the distin
guished patient in Milburn's home were
known to me merely as a man who had
received a gunshot wound and I knew
nothing more of him than what I could
see as a surgeon,' I would say, there was
absolutely no doubt of his recovery. My
apprehensions are now based not in the
least upon my views of this case as a
surgeon, but because of "the vast im
portance of the life of the patient to all
of us and to the nation." : 'i ..;.. ~''\
Dr. Charles McBurney of New York,
one of the most famous surgeons in this
country in dealing with wounds of the
nature of that inflicted upon the Presi
dent, made a thorough examination of
the distinguished patient and reported
that he could find no trace of peritonitis.
In response to the President's inquiry
he told him that he had more than a
fighting chance. ;
BUFFALO, Sept. 8.â While
Vice President Roosevelt was
looking over his mail at his
rooms in Ansley Wilcox's
home this morning and be
fore he had breakfasted, Dr. Matthew
D. Mann, the Buffalo specialist, who has
had a large practice here in abdominal
operations and who has been with the
President much of the time since he was
shot, called. Dr. Mann said he had
come k to give the Vice President the lat
est news from President McKinley and
lie came ali the more gladly because his
news was thoroughly encouraging. \He
said to Colonel Roosevelt that there was
every reason to believe the President
would recover.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"Then I will recover," was the Pres
ident's determined reply.
Dr. McBurney's statement, dictated
lor The Call to-night, follows:
"In regard to the present condition of
President McKinley I would call your
attention to the fact that it is but a
little over forty-eight hours since the
shot was fired. It is yet too soon to
speak confidently of the outcome. At
the present hour, however, and giving
due consideration to the severity of the
injury and the importance and extent
of the operation required, the patient's
condition . is entirely satisfactory. It is
gratifying to find that up to the present
time - none of the numerous signs of in
flammation or septic conditions have
appeared. The temperature is not too
high. It is lower to-night than it was
this morning*' The pulse. is better, the
facial expression is entirely satisfactory,
the mind is clear; there is no pain or
tenderness, noA nausea and no distension
of the abdomen.
' "The crisis will have passed Tuesday.
By that time we ought to be able to tell
with a reasonable degree of certainty
whether he is going to recover. Peri
tonitis has not developed. It will have
developed by Tuesday, probably, if it is
going to come at all. The wounds have
entirely closed. - They were closed im
mediately after the "operation. There has
been no subsequent exploration of the
wounds. The 'presumption is now that
the bullet is lodged in the muscles of the
back. If it is lodged there it is harm
less and there is no . need to take it
out.", ; ;
â¢ The doctor added that if the President*
lived until Tuesday he ought to be so
far recovered in three or four weeks as
to resume his ordinary duties.
': Secretary Cortelyou, iri whose hands
the management of everything seems to
be; was able, to take some rest this
morning for the 5 first time since : the
tragedy. -The great . confidence which
the'President has in his secretary could
not have beenmore strikingly illustrated
than at the exposition , hospital, when
he was about to be placed upon the op
erating table. The President ' realized
that " the sooner the operation was per
formed the better^and he ,was perfectly
willing to submit himself ; to the knife.
R : s only solicitude was as to the com
petency of the surgeons who were to
perform the operation. Just before ;he
was placed upon the table, he called Sec
retary Cortelyou to him ' and .'asked
â¢Mrs. McKinley, continues to bear up
bravely and her fortitude under the cir
cumstances is regarded as remarkable.
One of.her dearest and closest friends,
Mrs. Rand "of Washington, has arrived
here and will probably remain with her
during this trying; period.
The messages ' of sympathy from all
over the United States and all over the
world, in fact, have fairly overwhelmed
Secretary Cortelyou.. Two more White
House stenographers have been sent
for and, upon their arrival, perhaps to
morrow, some . of the important
messages will be made/public. Almost
every Government in the world has been
heard from* most. of the crowned heads
of Europe sending personal messages.
Among the latter are King Edward,
Emperor William, the Kings of Portu
gal, Italy and Sweden and the Sultan of
Turkey. President ; Lotibet. of . the , re
public Â»bf France has cabled his sym
pathy direct. One of the most touching
messages . thus ; far received was from
Madame Labori, the. wife of Maitre La
bori, who . defended Dreyfus in his fa
nous trial at. Rennes. .
MESSAGES POURING IN.
Vice President Roosevelt's attendance
at the morning service of the First Pres
byterian Church gave occasion- for a
heartfelt expression of the sorrow uni
versally felt over the calamity and the
detestation of.the assassin's .methods. A
fervid prayer by the pastor, Dr. Mitchell,
invoked the' sternest reprobation of an
archy and asked that the temples of pub
lic life be scourged of men willing- to
temporize with the madness of anarchy.'
The interest. in the President's condi
tion was such across the Canadian bor
der that the press' was asked to furnish
a bulletin this morning to be read in
the churches in Quebec and Montreal
and many requests of a similar character
came direct to Secretary Cortelyou from
different parts of the United States. ' -

however, they will return at once to

BERLIN. Sept. 8.â The United States
Embassador, Andrew D. .White, who was
Interviewed before his departure for Sass
nitz, said :
"President McKinley's death would be
a terrible loss at the time when he had
marked out a policy for the United States
calculated to complete magnificently his
career. I knew him, for many years and
never heard him speak without being
deeply Impressed by his. ability, patriot-
Ism and goodwill to all mankind. If there
ever was a democrat (1 use the word in

thing he had at heart was the welfare,
not of a person nor of a class, but of all
the people. . His conduct has been' ad

White * Eulogizes His Chief.
"These things come hardest on the

in her state of health, should have been

The Pope, the Daily News correspond-*

saying: . ~-\-u :Â¦ ;-.Â«*Â¦ Â¦
"Oh! How. earnestly I pray that he
may escape with his life. . These crimes
are the curse of our. day. I can only
offer the afflicted -victim and his poor

It is gratifying at least to see the universal
sympathy the crime has evoked for the victim.
The whole world is kin to-day alike In horror
at the act and in compassion for the Ameri
can President and the American people. Thus,
it may be, out of evil good will come and. the
nations be drawn into closer bonds of sym

Queen Margherlta, upon hearing the
news of the attempt upon the life of
President McKinley, says the Rome cor
respondent of the Daily News, said, with
tears in her eyes: -â¢ -
The Observer says:
The atrocity of the outrage again brings be
fore the public the question of how to deal
with anarchists. Scotland Yard knows a deal
more about the London anarchists than the
public realizes. The police even recognize
clubs In which anarchical doctrines are
preached and plots hatched. The members of
such organizations btamp . themselves as out
laws and the time has arrived when they
should be treated as such. They are a source
of terrible danger to the community and should
no longer be tolerated. ,
.The Sunday papers all voice the horror
and sympathy already expressed by the
daily press. The Sunday Special, after
commenting upon the insane aimlessness
with which the anarchists apparently se
lect their victims, says:
I rejeice to hear the favorable account of
the President's health. God gTant that his
life be preserved. EDWARD. Rex.

"The crime of 1865 was explained by po
litical passion. The crime of yesterday is
wholly inexcusable. It would, seem' that
a President chosen by universal suffrage
would be safe amid the people of -the'
freest country of the world. But, no.
Amid the outcasts of humanity are . de
generates who detest all authority. The
criminal explained all by declaring him
self an anarchist, and he was moved. by
the same motives as was the murderer of
the Empress of Austria. Anarchists are
indifferent as to how the .world regards
their crimes. They present ends which
are 'intelligible only to their own minds.
However, such a state of things cannot
be allowed to continue. The existing leg-"
islation against anarchism Is evidently
insufficient to accomplish its ends, and it
must be reconstituted, because states
have the right to enjoy liberty and not to
be affrighted lest their tranquillity be de

It was a motley crowd that gathered at
Pythian Castle yesterday ostensibly to
listen to a learned discourse upon "Samuel
the Seer," by John Robertson, but in real
ity to comment upon the great tragedy
which has plunged the nation into gloom.
There were eighty-four men, who were
for the greater part past the meridian of
life, and, eight women of uncertain pedi
gree and age. The majority of those
present were foreigners, of little educa
tion, but apparently possessed of the sin
gle idea that the affairs of humanity are
going to the dogs and that unless the ig
norance of the world is speedily dispelled
according to ihe anarchistic convictions
mankind is Irretrievably lost. The wom

themselves with applauding such in

they were ably represented on the ros

50 years, who wore a faded terra cotta
colored dress and hat; She sat in one cor

allusions, that brought the blush of shame

CINCINNATI, Sept. 8.â The ramification
of the band of anarchists which Is sup
posed to have been responsible for the
commission of the terrible tragedy at
Buffalo Friday is believed to extend Into
this city. The local police have received
a. telegram from Chief Wilkie of the Fed
eral Secret Service Department request
ing the arrest here of E. Laux, 1430 Mon
roe street. Beyond this statement no in
formation .was furnished. Detectives have
failed to locate Laux, as there is no such
number on Monroe .- street. The police
claim to have the details of a former plot
which was hatched here, and in which a
Cincinnati man left here for Canton, Ohio
the. home of the President, for the pur
pose of murder, but returned, unable to
fulfill his purpose. It is said that' Emma
Goldman visited here Incognito recently

to the street to a certain- extent resem
bles the man who attempted to take the
life of President McKinley.
This witness was seen from the street
and. a little later the police heard that a
plot had been, formed .to kill him.
His cell was changed to one that of
fered greater safety ;.and it is. said when
this change was made the prisoner first
learned \ot the attempt that had been
made upon the life of the President .
Eleven men and women who are
avowed anarchists were formally booked
to-night on the charges of conspiracy to
commit murder. They will be taken be
fore Justice Prindiville to-morrow morn
ing for a hearing. It is said that the pros
ecution will ask f.or.a continuance of ten
days that the police may have more time
for an investigation. This was admitted
to-night by Captain Colleran.
"I am not prepared to say that a con
spiracy to kill President McKinley was
formed in Chicago," he said. "The evi
dence in our possession has been turned
over to the law department, and while we
are ready to begin the hearing to-morrow
it Is possible that the city prosecutor may
want more time. In that event we will
ask for a continuance."
Chief O'Neill was directed to get the
names of all the outspoken anarchists
now in the city and to ascertain to what
extent their movement has progressed
during the last three or four years.
If any further proof were needed that
Leon Czolgosz was the guest of ! Chicago
anarchists shortly before he went to Buf
falo on his murderous mission against
President McKinley it was supplied to
day by three of the prisoners of the Cen
tral police station. They identified a pho
tograph of Czolgosz as' a picture of a man
whom they saw at the home of Abraham
Isaak,- 515 Carroll avenue, not longer ago
than July 12.
Chief O'Neill's order is the result of a
conference he had with Mayor Harrison
last night. Information to the effect that
Leon czolgosz, the Buffalo assassin, re
ceived part of his anarchistic education in
Chicago arid that he was one of tnose who
attenaed meetings at which Emma Gold
man and other anarchist leaders spoke in
this city, coupled with the experience of
the Mayor's own family, led Mr. Ham

To-day Mrs. McKinley went for a drive

that Dr. Rixey felt a drive in it would

result more than justified the physician's
opinion. Mrs. McKinley returned to the

Before commencing' his sermon. Bishop
Talbot offered a fervent prayer, in which
the congregation joined, that President
McKinley should recover from his griev
ous wound and that he should be restored
to health. Bishop Talbot said in part:
Whatever God gives us to do we must do it
here â here on the streets of San Francisco. If
you are to be pure and noble men and women
you must be so here and not in some distant
heaven. The ideal religious life is the life that

BERKELEY, Sept. 8.â In unsparing language Rev. R. L. Halsey of the First Baptist
Church, in his sermon this morning on "Our Chief Magistrate Stricken," denounced the
yellow press for .its share in the assassination of President McKinldy. In part he said:
"We should be thankful that we 'are not yet too dull to read the lessons that
this tragedy teaches. We may learn from it the lesson that freedom rampant is not lib
erty, but license â that the priests and priestesses of disorder and advocates of lawless
ness must be restrained; that their license may not begin wherever liberties end. We
may learn, moreover, that if you sow a thought you reap an act and that the indiscrimi
nate denunciations and insults and abuse of a vile and venal yellow journalism cannot
stand uncondemned. It is as accessory as lying and pandering to the anti-social pas
sions of man can make it. The colorâ yellowâ is appropriate. It is the Chinese color,
and our yellow'press resembles and is at one with the Chinese Boxers, and sells its
placards for 5 cents a day. At present for a few days it will bottle up its vitriolic vitu
peration. It dare not pour it out before an indignant public. But we know its character
and we need to stir ourselves and see to it that men who pander with their press to, the
vilest and most dangerous passions of human nature be given to understand that they
forfeit the respect of all decent men and worthy citizens."

To-day, dear brethern, we are sitting in the
shadow of a great national calamity. The chief
magistrate of the republic has been struck down

life and death. It is our duty to pray that God,
through whom alone all rulers have rule, to
spare him to the country that chose him to

It Is the teaching of holy writ and of holy

discharging its proper functions the authority it

and safeguarded by the. consent of eighty mil

Rev. William Rader, pastor of the Third
Congregational Church, aroused applause
by his utterances agrainst anarchy and
yellow journalism last evening. The
church was far too small to accommodate
the attendance and hundreds were turned
away. Dr. Rader delivered an eloquent
address and his fervent remarks aroused
enthusiasm.' In part he said:

The epirlt of anarchy seems to be having its
own way in San Francisco at the present time.
The other day while walking down one or our
busy thoroughfares I met a gentleman who
had just got away from a crowd of lawless and
inhuman fellows who had beaten him unmerci
fully. His face was covered with blood and as
he staggered along three of tbe band of brig,

murderer*, the anarchical revolutionists and the
assassins of rulers. Literature Is being now
circulated throughout the city, cursing the
church and state and slandering the clergy. It
advocates * # a world-wide universal strike, not
to uphold government but to pet all the good
out of the evil, as long as It existsâ and it Is the
quietest and quickest plan, and the most eco
nomical of human life that can now be carried
out!"
A few years ago the anarchists organized in
Han Francisco under the direction of Pietro
Gorl. a man who was expelled from Switzer
land for attempting to organize a band of anar
chists. But America, the land of unrestrained
liberty, welcomes him and others of his kind.
Think of such men roing about In this country
dleseminatlns such doctrine that expelled them
from their own country! Gorl succeeded in or
ganizing a society in this city and when he pre
sented the eo^Jety with the banner of anarchy,
a. flae of blood red color, bordered with black,
the adherents went wild with enthusiasm. The
society was called the "Socialistic- Anarchical
Federation of the Italian Workmen of North
America. San Francisco Branch." From these
societies come the bomb-throwers, the Mafia
The anarchist, whatever part he plays In the
scheme of lawlessness, is a traitor to his coun
try and should be dealt with accordingly.
Anarchy neither fears God nor regards man.
Its cry, according to one of its American lead
ers, Herr Most, is: â¢â¢Religion, authority and
the etate are all carved out of the same piece
of woodâ to the devil with them all." Thai's
where Herr Most and all of his kind would have
gone long ere this. If It -were not for the exist
ence of the very things they condemn.
In his sermon last evening the Rev.
Frank K- Baker, pastor of the First
Methodist Episcopal Church, spoke with
out fear of anarchists and the lawless ele
ment of this city. He charged these
classes of society with being dangerous
to any community, and said they .should
be checked before they could do further
mischief. After reviewing the act of
Czolgosz, the speaker traced the history
of anarchy. He also took occasion to con
demn the beating of non-union men by
the rough element of this city. He said
in part:
ers of the Bed Flag.

ANARCHY NEITHER
FEARS GOD NOR MAN
Let all good people unite in the prayer that
God may give wisdom and skill to the sur
geons, may bless all the means used and in
infinite mercy restore our loved President to
health and usefulness. \
The abnse of public men, the
charge that our rulers are in leagrue
with monopolists to enslave the la
borer; tbe use of pictures and car
toons to ridicule officers of state
and fill the minds of illiterate peo
ple with imaginary evils and dan
grers. These are not only in bad
taste, but they encourage disorder
and Inflame the evil passions of
weak-minded men.
Has not the time come when cluba of an
archists which openly advocate the assassina
tion of rulers should be suppressed and their
leaders incarcerated or banished? No other
human Government has had such' noble men
as rulers as our Presidents have been. We
honor ourselves and our nation as we honor
them. \
In a prelude to his regular sermon Rev.
E. A. Woods, pastor of the First Baptist
Church, delivered an able address last
evening to his congregation on the at
tempted assassination of the President.
In part he said:
The civilized world is appalled" at this crime.
The American people are stunned by the blow.
The indignation is inexpressible. That a man
so true and pure, so kind and generous so wise
and patriotic should be thus shot down seems
incredible. We boast of our freedom, free
speech and a free press, but may it not be that
license is disgu!sed as liberty and lawlessness
as independence?

At both morning and evening services
prayers were offered for the recovery of
the President.
The aivful crime that has wound
ed this nation In these sad days is
first and last attributable to the
veriest eodleiss incitements of hu
man weakness and hnman pansion,
stirred r.nd tired in the fanatical
brain of the criminal, who, while
personally responsible and verily
acconntable to this great people
and his God, Is representative of
the senseless, extravagant and Bod
leÂ«Â» teachings of certain Irrespon-
Mlble journals, of certain little so
cieties and dangerous Individuals
whose first motto Is, "Xo God," and
his logric is therefore, "Xo govern
ment and down with all authority.*'
Any expression in journalismâ
Â¦o-calledâ that arrays class ngratnst
clous, or man acainst man. or
-widen* tbe assumed breacb between
manual labor and mental labor, is
most dangerous to the interests of
sooicty, for there can be no real
devotion to God that does not recog
nize His common fatherhood, and
therefore the universal brotherhood
of man and the unity of interests
of men. Whenever the band of man
is raised apalnst his fellow man. or
the tong-ne or pen of man is used
to incite liatred or diÂ»Â«enÂ»ionÂ« of
society, there is a tendency to an
archy and crime.
After showing that anarchy was the di
rect result- of the denial of the existence
of God the reverend gentleman spoke as
follows:
At the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church yesterday morning: Rev. S. D.
Hutsinpiller took for his topic. "The true
g-ospel for the sins and sorrows of this
wour.ded nation to-day."
Yellow Publications Are Dan
g-erous to Society.
Rev. S. D. Hutsinpiller Declares the
It is, -therefore, time for action, prompt
action, severe action. If it is wrong to murder,
it is certainly wrong to teach others to murder,
and that is what anarchist literature does.
The shooting of McKinley and the cheering
of the foul deed by Chicago anarchists shows
us a poisonous fang with the boiling malice of
perdition roaring behind it. directed at the very
heart of public and private safety and welfare.
This foul deed that has made the heart of the
nation bleed is but a single drop of that great
ocean of calamity that would sweep forward In
universal destruction, crushing nations and civ
ilization like eggshells, were anarchism let full
upon us.
The rights of personal liberty do not give
me privilege of poisoning my neighbor's well
or directly to poison his body. Neither should
the rights of a free press give privilege to poi
son the public mind and conscience through the
publication of anarchist ideas.
Tbe publication of anarchist pa
pers and literature should be sup
pressed and the publication of such
made a capital crime.
It' is so fiendish-hearted in its nature that
we must deal with it in severest measures. A
law should be passed compelling all anarchists
to leave our country.
Anarchism is an enemy of no
frightful a mien that we cannot
rimh too quickly to plunge the
sword to its heart.
The shooting of President McKinley by Czol
gOEZ is a deed so dastardly, a deed so full of
hell itself, that we cannot find language to con
demn it severely enough.- It gives us another
view of that awful monster, anarchism, which
as a hydra-headed fiend is uncovering Itself
in our land.
Rev. "W. E. Dugan of the Stewart
Memorial United Presbyterian Church
said:

Lawlessness in this community was also
condemned. The inhuman beatings given
men who have the hardihood to take the
places of men who are out on strike were
referred to in many pulpits. One minister
said this was akin to a spirit of anarchy
and should not be tolerated in a\free
country. j -
The pasters also paid their respects to
"yellow journalism." One pastor declared
that the public press had no right to
poison the public mind and conscience
through the publication of anarchistic
ideas. Another pastor said: "Let us fur
ther hope that the pistol shot in Buffalo
sounds the death knell of yellow journal

citizen of the land. They dwelt on the
fortitude, courage and dignity displayed
by the President when wounded, and la
mented the fact that such a- noble Chris

IN every church in San Francisco
prayers were offered yesterdaj' to
spare the President to the country
that chose him to govern It. Pas

â¢which they condemned the action
to spare the man's life. With some curses for

meeting, attended by about 500 Poles, of
which it is estimated there are SO.00O in
New York City, was held to-day at the
Church of St. Stanislaus, and bitter
words of denunciation of Czolgosz and
his crime were uttered, while the expres
sion of sympathy for the President and
those belonging to him was 'warm and
universal.'
Doubt as to the nationality of the
would-be assassin was expressed, and it
was decided to send a delegate to Cleve
land and Toledo at once to look into his
ancestry and to prove to the American
people that he is not a Pole, but a Rus

shooting of President McKinley and pro
tested against the statements that the
would-be assassin. was connected with the
Polish people Â¦ in .thia country. Among
those present were five Polish priests.
The resolution, after regretting the at
tempted murder, continues as follows:

The message -was, signed by all the
members of the official board. The adop

remarks by several of the leading mem
bers of the church, all filled with.sentl
ments of the deepest regret for the Buf
falo tragedy and highest praise for the
President as a man and a member of
their - congregation. "When the meeting*
finally adjourned the members of the con

changing condolences and regrets. These
expressions, however, were not entirely
harmonious, for mingled with the general
conversation were, remarks in depreca

WASHINGTON, Sept. 8.â "The exigen

these exigencies are disease, accident and
the bullet of the assassin, such as we
have heard of in the past forty-eight
hours. That occurrence at Buffalo indi
cates that no man is safe from the shaft
of death. It is very difficult to get away
from it, and while I have ever been loyal
to the law and have ever contended for
its stTict enforcement, I must say that
the affair of last Friday has almost con

The above extract from the sermon of
Dr H Â¦ R Naylor, presiding elder of the
Washington district, was tne only direct
reference made in the regular sermon
preached to-day at the Metropolitan
MetHbdist Episcopal Church, which is the
church President McKinley attends when
in Washington. Of the several prayers
all were supplications for the early res
toration of health to the President, of
tiraise' for his personality and an admoni

this trying time. When the regular serv
ice had been concluded the congregation,
which was large, transformed itself into
a mass meeting, and upon motion of

following expression of the sense of the
congregation be sent to the President:

The National Association of Chiefs of Police
of the United States and Canada at the last
annual meeting adopted a resolution invitlns
the heads of foreign police departments to par

tressing calamity which this country has re
cently experienced through the assault by an
unknown assassin, confirms the belief that the
import of the resolution should be impressed
on foreign officials, with a view of having such
of their number present at our next annual
meeting as may be able to attend; this with
the hope that a closer. relationship may be es
tablished officially and personally, and that
there may be an interchange of opinion as to
the best methods to be pursued to eliminate
from society such organizations and persons as
may be evilly disposed toward institutions of
government and those charged with their con-
Th'is Is a most vital question and if the laws

would forever prevent the like in this country
and aid the authorities abroad. I trust the
members will give thi3 matter close and careful
consideration and offer such suggestions as may
aid in accomplishing the desired end and that
the secretary will be authorized to adopt such
measures as will bring about a thorough un
derstanding with our foreign friends and to se

In the meantime there should be active ef
forts made to looking to the eradication of
these evils and information gathered and dis
seminated through the national bureau of
criminal identification with a view of accom
plishing such result.
This proposition will be acted upon by
the directors individually by mail. If the
board of directors vote to adopt their ex
ecutive's views the secretary of the asso
ciation will be authorized to address a
letter to the officials having charge of the
police affairs of the European nations,
requesting their attendance at the con

some definite steps will be taken to ef
fectually stamp out or destroy the danger
arising from anarchistic plots. The let

yesterday, and Major Sylvester expects to
receive replies within the next week.

ON ANARCHY'S TRAIL
God grant that the life of Mr. McKinley may
be spared, .and that he may be restored to
health and strength to bring joy and comorrt
to his now afflicted family. I earnestly ask
this congregation to pray fervently to God for
his safe recovery.
Father Ducey of St. . Leo's (Roman
Catholic), in the course of extended re
marks on the tragedy at Buffalo, said:
As you are aware that a great calamity has
befallen the nation during the last few days
in an attempt on the life of its chief executive,
and as it is of vital Importance thai he should
again be able to continue an administration
which has brought so much happiness and pros
perity to this country, your prayers are re
quested for his speedy restoration.
I feel that I am called upon to express some
what of your feelings and your sympathy, and
to lead your prayers for President McKinley,
who is the victim of such a dastardly crime.
Though a stranger to your country. It is easy
for me to do this, since it needs no local knowl
edge of policies but merely the expression of the
universal heart of man. As for the deed itself,
the whole civilized world must pronounce ab
horrence not only of the act but o* the destest
able principles which inspired It. Nowhere out
side of America, moreover, will sorrow be
keener or prayer be more fervent than in Great
Britain.
Preceding the prayer at St. Patrick's
Cathedral, Father Dyer said:
The Rev. Hugh Black, associate pastor
of Free St. George's Church, Edinburgh,
Scotland, was In the pulpit of the Fifth
Avenue Presbyterian Church to-day. As
a prelude to his sermon he said:
Thus he (Gideon) resembles our own great
leadersâ Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Lin

not least. William McKinley. ' the man whose
spirit is now hovering between life and death,
the man whose name will go down to posterity

Kinley:

Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, in
a sermon based on Gideon as an Israel-
The whole nation, aye, the whole world, to
day is watching: at the bedside of a President
whom It has learned to regard as Just and true.
We are under the shadow of a great anxiety,
overwhelmed by a great calamity. It is to
God that the people turn at such a time. In
him lies the power and strength to heal the
sick. May it be his will to restore to us our
President in life and strength.
At Old Trinity Church to-day the Rev.
Alfred L. Griffin, in addition to referring
to Mr. McKinley in the prayer for per
sons under affliction, included the Presi
dent's wife, and this was the case in most
of the churches. The keynote of the ser
mons may be gathered from these words
by Mr. Griffin:
There was no concerted action in this
matter by the churches other than that
called forth by Mayor Van "Wyck's proc
lamation of Saturday calling: on the pas
tors of- churches of all denominations to
direct their services with special reference
to the suffering President. In the Prot
estant Episcopal churches almost 'with
out exception the full text of the litany
was read and the name of President Mc-
Kinley was entered in the general prayer
for the sick. In all the Roman Catholic
churches a special uniform prayer was
offered at every mass.
In a majority of the pulpits those occu
pying them took as their theme the
attack on the life of Mr. McKinley, and
in almost every case some reference was
made to the tragedy, either in the ser
mon itself jut in the prelude. In some
instances demand 'was made for meas
ures of suppression against the anarchis
tic propaganda, which was generally held
responsible for the deed of Czolgosz.
To-morrow (Monday) will witness an
other session of prayer and pleading. In
the afternoon the children of the public
schools of this city and Brooklyn to the
number of hundreds of thousands will
follow the instructions of the president of
the Board of Education, and under the
lead of their teachers will hold a special
session of prayer for President McKin
ley.
NEW YORK. Sept. 8.â Not a church ser

CHICAGO. Sept. 8.â Two thousand
members of the socialists voted down a
resolution of regret at the attempted as

the resolution was that ilcKinley was the
representative of the capitalist class, and
that his safety or danger was a matter

SAYS ANARCHISTS
ARE ENEMIES OF LAW
"In my judgment," said Mr. Miller, "the
attempted assassination of the President
again suggests that in.: forming our crim
inal laws we have paid too little attention
to the protection of the Government. As
a general rule the law takes no more ac
count of an assault upon the- President
than upon a private citizen. If, as all
good people hope, the President shall sur
vive this attack, the offense, if the laws
of New York are as I suppose they are,
is simply an assault with intent to com
mit murder. It seems to be that they
should be so framed as to take Into ac
count the President's public character;
in short, that r.n attempt to take the life
of the President should be deemed treason
and be punished accordingly.

upon the President's life should be, treated
as treason, says W. H. H. Miller, Attor

ATTACK SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED TREASON
After eight policemen were â¢ treacherously
murdered by the anarchists in Chicago in 1886
a bill was drafted and presented to both houses
of representatives favoring' the rigid exclusion
and deportation of all alien anarchists. I be
lieve that bill failed to pass, but surely with
this latest crime before us we shall not cease
to urge and pray for the passage of some law
by which every known anarchist may be ban
ished or imprisoned with hard laBbr. .. and the
monster Czolgosz be sentenced to -solitary con
finement for life.
In the brutal attack on President McKinley
there can be but one universal verdict that it
was a most treacherous and .Â¦ diabolical act
against one who is the peer if not the superior
of any living ruler on earth. No incentive was
there to the atrocious deed other than the de
pravity of the anarchists, whose creed is no
tiod, no government, no work, no home, no
marriage, and whose banner Is the red flag of
riot and murder. * Â¦ "
Three times in less. than fifty years has the
assassin's hand been raised against the highest
officer in the United States Government, and
every time against a man who honored the po
sition to which he had been elected. Four
times in a little over seven years has the hand
of the anarchist been dipped In the blood of as
many rulers and in every instance they who
'were selected as victims were among the great
est in their positions.
Rev. Philip Coombe, pastor of the Rich
mond Congregational Church, delivered a
stirring sermon against anarchy last
evening. In the course of his remarks he
said:

The fearful responsibility for the dastardly
attack on President McKinley lies afthe door
of anarchy. ! This diabolical movement, which
has been permitted to gain strength In Pater
son, N. J., and Chicago, is directly answerable
for the crime. The man who struck our be
loved executive In the prime of his career Is an
avowed anarchist and claims to have been in
cited to commit the heinous deed by the in

PASTOR BELIEVES IN
STRENUOUS MEASURES
In this connection. It Is of Interest that some
experienced surgeons do not mind the tempera
ture at all In noting the bulletins of the Presi
dent's condition, but say that so long as the
pulse Is in the proper relation to the tempera
ture In a big operation like this it is very com
mon, for the temperature to remain around 102
or even 103. But if the temperature had
dropped and the pulse had accelerated It would
have been a danger signal of peritonitis-setting
In. It Is of interest also to know that after an
operation of this kind the peristaltic or com
pressive action In the abdominal cavity ceases
or becomes retrograde.
In turning .-up the stomach, an act that was
absolutely necessary, and was performed by
Dr. Mann with rare skill, the danger Was that
some of the contents of tha stomach might get
into the abdominal cavity and as a result cause
peritonitis. It so happened that there was very
little in the President's stomach at the time of
the operation. Moreover, subsequent devolop
ments tend to show that this feature of the
operation was grandly successful and that none
of the contents of the stomach entered the ab
dominal cavity. If any of the contents had en
tered the cavity the probability is that by now
peritonitis would have set In.
The operation lasted almost an hour. A cut
about five Inches long was made. It was found
necessary to turn up the stomach of the Presi
dent in order to traee the course of the bullet.
The bullet's opening in the front wall of the
stomach was small and it was carefully closed
with sutures, after which a search was made
for the hole In the back wall, of the stomach.
This hole, where the bullet 'went out of the
stomach, was larger than the hole of the front
wall of the stomach, in fact it was a wound of
an inch in diameter, jagged and ragged. It
was sewed up In three layers. This wound was
larger than the wound where the bullet entered
the stomach, because the bullet In Its course
forced tissues ahead of it.
The operation performed at the Emergency
Hospital left no need. for a second operation to
follow It almost immediately. The full details
of the operation therefore , have not been
known. It was performed by Dr. Matthew D.
Mann. Ilia first assistant was Dr. Herman
Mlnter. His second assistant was Dr. John
Parmenter. His third assistant was Dr. Lee
of St. Louis, who happened to be on the ex
position grounds at the time of the tragedy
and placed his services at the disposal of the
President. Dr. Nelson "W. Wilson noted the
time of the operation and took the notes. Dr.
Eugene "W'asdin of the Marine Hospital gave
the anaesthetic. Dr. Rixey arrived at the lat
ter part of the operation, and held the light.
Dr. Parke arrived at the close of the opera
tion. Dr. Mann wielded the knife.

in the fire. .Â¦; Â¦ '. "..;;
The fire started . early in the morning
and lasted the better part of two days.
European proprietors of business houses
and larger Chinese merchants were the
heaviest sufferers. .During the progress
of the fire and immediately after it, the
coolie native population commenced. loot-
Ing the half-burned buildings and stole
everything that they could lay hands on.
The Chinese police, under their European
officers, were unable to prevent the loot
ing except in a small degree, and before
the second evening had passed a large
number of regular soldiers were * called*
out. At. that time many people had been
killed in fights, and there were dead bod
ies in every street. Five men were killed
by the falling of a three-story building.

the natives who were running away with
stolen goods held on to their bundles. The

LEADING FIGURES IN A YOLO COUNTY SENSATION THAT CAUSES
RESIDENTS IN LISBON DISTRICT TO FEAR THE PRESENCE OF AN
INNOCENT AND PRETTY GIRL.
5
THE SAN FRANCISCO , CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1901;
No inducement would lead any of the
Portuguese residents of ~the Lisbon dla
trict to pass the home of the Corrie fam
ily before sunrise or after sunset. Tha
unfortunate Marie wonders " in her mind
why those who so. kindly greeted her
when she. arrived- in Yolo County now
shun her and pass i hurriedly away, with
a prayer on their lips and their hands
grasping their rosaries. .
"In the space of an hour yesterday the
girl was attacked three times, the spells
lasting ten to fifteen minutes. The girl's
body swelled from the abdomen up to the
throat and it is this peculiar swelling that
makes her relatives and friends think that
an evil spirit is within her. â¢ :
The condition of the girl lasted for
twenty minutes and then it passed away
as quickly as it began. She sat upright
on her brother's knee and smiled upon
him. Her pulse was again normal and,
in reply to questions from her brothers,
stated that she had been sitting in the
same position all the time. Manuel and
Juan Corrie fear to tell their sister that
they believe an evil spirit inhabits her
body and guarded questions as to wheth
er she knows of anything strange hap
pening elicited a negative response. When
asked if she felt any pain she complained
of a peculiar sensation ; in her chest.
Hesitate to Tell Fears to Sister.
Suddenly the girl's body commenced
to quiver and, with a scream, she struck
at her brother's face. Juan Corrie, Mrs.
Corrie and Manuel Corrie had difficult
work to restrain the girl. She struggled
violently and almost succeeded In break
ing from the grasp of her powerful broth
ers. Her pulse rapidly increased and her
eyes assumed a dull glaze. No word pass
ed her lips, but a peculiar sound seemed
to come from her throat. To some <fues
tions nut to â¢ her by her brothers, who
claimed they were speaking to the spirit
within her body, she shook or nodded her
head. Her limbs became perfectly rigid
and her hands were clenched fast. Per
spiration rolled from the brows of the
Corrie brothers, as the powerfully built
men struggled to hold their little sister
in their iron grasp.
W hen The Call correspondent reached
the home of Manuel Corrie yesterday the
entire family was about to -partake of din
ner. Marie Corrie sat on the knee of her
brother Manuel while he talked to his in
terviewer. Â¦
Mrs. J. Sarameno and Miss Fernandez
declare that the spirit spoke to them in
two languages and shouted loudly in reply
to their questions.
uncle of Marie Corrie, who is one of the
wealthy ranchers of Yolo County; Marie
Fernandez and Manuel Fernandez cou
sins of Marie Corrie, American born and
educated in the public schools, all told
stories yesterday of how they had con
versed with the evil spirit in the body of
Marie Corrie.
, Manuel Caldera, a young rancher, born
In this State; Antoine Dutra, another
American-born citizen; Enis Rosa, one of
the prominent residents in Lisbon dis
trict; Mrs. Antoine Varenz, wife of a
well-to-do rancher; Manuel Fernandez,
Says She Sapfce to the Spirit.
"I spoke to the^vil spirit in Marie Cor
rie," said Mrs. Gouvenor, "not once, but
many times. I spoke to it, one evening
for more than! an hour. It, told me of
three murders It had committed, of many
robberies and of ruin brought to young
girls. It said it could speak in many lan
guages, and when I spoke to it in English
it answered me in Portuguese. It shouted
at times, but Marie's lips never moved.
It was awful to see how her body swelled
up when the evil spirit was there."
On the Yolo side of the ferry the coun
ty road runs up and down the river. A
short distance from the ferry is the Por
tuguese church and the house of the
young priest. Father Soares. He talks
English but little, and was not Inclined
to discuss the case of Marie Corrie. His
manner showed plainly that he realizes
he cannot quell the fears of his flock or
override their beliefs that Marie Corrie
is possessed of an evil spirit.
"It is superstition," eald Father Soares.
"The girl is sick, but because she has
spoken the names of a few American cit
ies, the people think that it is a spirit
within her. It is nothing, I assure you."
There was a sad look on the face of
Father Soares as he ushered his visitor
from his humble home. It was that of
a man who felt the magnitude of a diffi
cult task and problem. Father Soares'
task is to eradicate the fears that possess
the men and women who look to him for
spiritual guidance. Â¦
Mrs. Frank Gouvenor, the middle-aged
wife of Jose Gouvenor, resides a few
yards from the home of Father Soares.
Both wife and husband have lived in the
Lisbon district for many years and are
highly respected by all who know them.
Joe Praie, who ferries travelers and
wagrons across the Sacramento River at
Freeport, said:
"Ah. the poor little Marie Corrie is af
flicted by God. It was a month ago that
the evil spirit went into the girl's body.
He was a bad spirit, for he says he has
Killed three men, stolen lots of money
and ruined girls. Sometimes he leaves
her body for a few days and then he
comes back. Last night he was there
and he carried on in a wicked manner.
We pray to the good Madonna to help
poor Marie Corrie. She is such a child,
so gentle, so kind. She has made us all
love her. but we can only help her with
our prayers. Doctors can do no good,
help must come from God and the good
priests."
Tells of the Girl's Affliction.
fears of the Portuguese that make them
say what they do."
It was mainly due to the success in life
of their uncle, Manuel Fernandez, that the
Corrie brothers located in Yolo County.
Fernandez has lived in the district for
many years and is one of the wealthy
His fellow countrymen grave him a help
ing hand, and he toiled early and late in
the fields. It was not long ere Manuel
Corrie sent to Portugal for his younger
brother, Juan, and the two brothers, by
hard work, soon acquired possession of a
number of acres.
His friends had written to him that Cal
ifornia was a fair land and that under
the laws every man was free to pursue
his calling in life. Thus it was that Man
uel Corrie, full of ambition, located in the
Lisbon district of Yolo County.
Manuel Corrie is a stalwart rancher,
who left his country home in the village
of Pique, Portugal, eleven years ago to
seek his fortunes in the New World.
"Wearied of the toil that barely gave to
him and his a sordid existence, he set
bravely forth to the Pacific slopes of the
great American republic.
One month apo rumors spread in Sacra
mento that a young 1 Portuguese girl, re
cently arrived from her birthplace in Eu
rope, had been taken suddenly 111, and
that wonderful tales were being told by
the Portuguese ranchers as to the evil
pplrlt that had taken up its abode in the
girl's body.
Call special correspondent by
many ' of . the Portuguese ranchers
who live in the Lisbon district of Yolo
County, Â¦which district Is located for many
miles up a'nd down the Sacramento River,

lage of Kreeport, situated nine miles from

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 8.â "Little
Marie Corrie is possessed of an

This {statement tras made to a
"The evil spirit is too powerful for these
priests," is the explanation made yester
day by many of the people. "Doctors can
do no good," they said. "It will take one
of the greatest of priests to drive the
spirit from the body of Marie Corrie."
â¢ In the little cluster of houses facing the
Freeport ferry the condition of Mario
Corrie and the fears of the Portuguese
ranchers are daily discussed. The way
side inn of Freeport is kept by P. J.
Rhiel, who is assisted in his business by
"W. Arenz. They are Americans of a
sturdy type and are possessed of good
common sense. .While The Call corre
spondent was. talking to Rhiel and Arenz
the wife of the latter joined the group.
"I went over to see Marie Corrie," said
Mrs. Arenz, "and there is something very
peculiar about the spells she has. I can
not talk Portuguese, but I heard the peo
ple talking to the girl in that language.
They told me that they were conversing
with the evil spirit in. the girl's body and
that it answered them. We Americans
think that it is only the . superstitious
Some of the friends of the Corrie family
sought' the services of priests in Sacra
mento and the gentle fathers readily came
to the side of the young Portuguese girl.
To tiie statements of the priests that no
evil spirit was in the body of Marie Cor
rie the ranchers and their families turned
a deaf ear. .Â¦ â¢ ,
Those who have stood by the girl's side
when she has been in one of, her spells
state that the evil spirit has fully an
swered all questions put to it. They as
sert that it has informed them that It is
the spirit of a man who has committed
three murders, stolen countless sums ol
money and brought many young girls to
shame.
Doctors from Sacramento have exam
ined the girl and the priest of the Lisbon
settlement. Father Soares, has joined
with the medical men in trying to calm
the fears of the ranchers and their fam
ilies, but with no success.
Two days spent in the Lisbon district
by The Call correspondent showed that
the people fully believe that the evil
spirit inhabiting the body of Marie Cor
rie is one of pronounced malignity.
Believe Evil Spirit Is Present.
The assertion Is so fully accepted' that
even to speak to one of the Portuguese
ranchers or their families of the condir
tlon of Marie Corrie causes their faces
to pale with terror, while their lips move
silently in prayer, their hands stealing
to their bosoms in order to clutch the
rosaries or other sacred emblems they
carry on their breasts.
terviewed .by a Call correspondent and
all adhere to the story that an evil spirit
has taken up Its abode in the body of the
young Portuguese girl.
From mouth to mouth the story has
been passed along and while many of the
Portuguese families told what they had
heard from others It was an easy matter
to find men and Â¦women who had stood by
the side of Marie Corrie and who claimed
they had held long conversations with
the evil spirit within her body.
The story told by these people was re
counted with absolute sincerity. There
was no attempt at deception, and many
volunteered the statement that they
would never have believed what they had
heard from others, but had satisfied them
selves that an evil spirit was In their
midst.
Men and women of mature years, youths
and maidens, all join in stating that they
have spoken for more than an hour, at
various times with the evil spirit that
they claim, with all sincerity, is living in
the body of the unfortunate Marie Corrie.
Dozens of the Portuguese ranchers'liv
ing in the Lisbon district have been in-
From the day, one month ago, when
Marie Corrie was seized with the first
strange spell, she has suffered a number
of similar attacks in rapid succession.
Ranchers far and wide In the Lisbon dis
trict heard of the strange doings in the
household of the Corrie family and many
came from, their homes to verify what
others had told them. â¢.,"."
Strange sounds proceeded from her
throat. Her lips did not move, but the
sounds were similar in every respect to
those made by a ventriloquist. Marie's
body, from the abdomen to the 'throat,
swelled to abnormal size and her arms
and legs became almost rigid. Her hand*
were tightly clenched and the strength of
her brothers could not relax the firm grip.
As' suddenly as the spell began so it
ended and Marie Corrie looked into the
faces about her with a smile. She wan
entirely unconscious of Â¦ what had taken
placÂ« and In reply to questions simply
said that she had a severe pain In her
chest. Â¦ Â¦ '
Body Is Abnormally Swollen.
The aged mother came to the assistance
of her sons and for an hour they were
engaged in preventing Marie from harm
ing herself or those around her.
The weeks slipped i quickly Â¦ along and
there was not a cloud to mar the hap
piness of the Corrie family until one
month ago. In the middle of the 'day
Marie | Corrie suddenly rushed upon her
brother Manuel and sought to strike him.
There was a fierce expression on her face
and when the powerful rancher sought to
restrain his little sister he found that his
strength was not sufficient. Calling his
brother Juan to his aid the two strong
men overpowered Marie, who seemed to
be endowed with superhuman strength.
Marie Corrie is a trifle over 18 years old.
She is slight in stature, a demure little
miss of a most lovable disposition. She
soon settled down to the rural life on her
brothers' ranches and in the evenings
would singr while her aged mother and
brothers listened with delight.
From New York they came overland by
train, and at Sacramento mother and
daughter were met by Manuel and Juan
Corrie, who took them to their home on
the banks of the Sacramento River.
Manuel and Juan Corrle wherv their
day's labor was finished often talked of
the oid home In far away Portugal. There
lived the aged mother and father and
their sister Marie. According to state
ments made by the Corrie brothers yes
terday their father had neglected his fam
ily, leaving his sons and his wife to earn
a living 'while he sought oblivion to his
earthly duties by carousing in the wine
shops of the little village of Pique.
Four months ago Manuel Corrie and his
brother Juan sent enough money to their
mother to bring her and their sister Marie
from Portugal to this country. The moth
er and daughter Journeyed, from their
home In the village of Pique to Lisbon,
and there secured passage for New York.

Not only does Jamaica's export trade refuse to fol
low the flag; but her import trade is becoming equally

The summary shows that of the exports of Jamaica
57 per cent were sent to the United States in 1896,
while in 1900 the share was 63.6 per cent. To the
United Kingdom the share in 1896 was 27.6 per cent
and in 1900 19.2 per cent. The report says: "The
value of the exports from Jamaica which go to the
United States continues to increase in total value and
in proportion to the. whole amount of the trade. The
exports to the United Kingdom diminish steadily.
This tendency is largely due to the development of
the fruit trade, which has hitherto been almost exclu
sively with the United States."
FROM the Treasury Bureau of Statistics there
has been issued a summary of a report of the
trade of Jamaica taken from British colonial re
ports for 1899 and 1900. It affords a striking evidence
of the fallacy of the doctrine that trade follows- the
flag, for, while the flag that floats in' Jamaica is Brit
ish, the course of trade in the island is strongly and
increasingly in our direction. . ' â¢"?.

:The Boston Globe, in reviewing the early organiza
tion of labor unions in Massachusetts, notes that in
1849, during the first strike on record at Lowell, the

At present the Home for Feeble-minded

Dr. Osborne was dismissed for the sole
purpose of making way for a physician
who has political influence. 1 The trustees
have' committed Â¦ a . crime ; against the
State, for Dr. .Osborne was the -right man
in the right = placej having had so many
years' experience in caring for the feeble
minded. In an institution of this kind
politics should have no place.
Dr. Osborne made the training of feeble
minds a life study, and the high standing
of the home to-day is due. to his untiring
efforts. His successor, Dr. W. M. Lawlor,
has had no experience with those unfortu
nates afflicted with a blighted intellect,
and, it is criminal on the part of Gover
nor Gage and his henchmen, the trustees
of the institution, to turn Dr. Osborne
out. * â¢ . â¢
When the home was founded, fifteen
years ago, Dr. Osborne was elected to the
position of superintendent, and the duties
devolving upon him have ever since been
faithfully, honorably and efficiently exe
cuted. He is_a man of very few equals
in his profession, especially in the line in
which he has engaged for the past fifteen
years. He has been superintendent
through Democratic and . Republican ad

or faithfulness to duty questioned.
The summary dismissal of Dr. A. E.
Osborne from the position of superin

Hannibal, completed In 1S97, were built by

those built by other contractors for ships
of the same type and power. During the

proved herself the best and most econom
ical ship in the contending fleets, as her
coal consumption was less by four tons a
day and her Â£peed half a knot greater an

Two Ironclads, the Audacious and In

list of the" British 1 ' navy and are being
converted into depots for torpedo-boat de

at a cost of ;i,315,M0 and her repairs up
to 1S99 foot up to $1,495,935, an excess of
$179,993 over the original cost. The Invin
cible," built in 1871, cost $1,268,045, and $668,
815 in repairs during her thirty years of
active service. Three third class cruisers
âthe Garnet, Ruby and Tourmalineâ of
2120 tons, which were struck off the list
three years ago, are being converted into
coal hulks. They were built during 1873
and 1S77 and were of the composite class
that is. iron frames planked with wood
and copper sheathed. Their usefulness as
cruising vessels averaged about twenty
years and their good and reliable speed of
thirteen knots, together with the moder
ate expense of repairs, made this type a
very popular class of vessels in the Brit

In our local market there is little change to report.
Our farm products are still in demand for a vast area
though one or two are slackening from their recent
abnormal activity, as the later crops of the Western
States are beginning to compete with the California
products. This happens every year. But we have sent
so much of our farm produce out of the State during
the past two months that if the stream kept up we
might run short ourselves. This has been a great
year for .California farm products and trade 'ts feeling
the beneficient effects thereof. If we had made the
season ourselves we could hardly have improved upon
It. Perhaps we might not have done so well.
Aside from this distressing and startling dose, how
ever, the week made t. fine record. The bank clear
ings gained 33.2 per cent over the corresponding, week
in 1000 and every city of note except Omaha showed
a gain. The staples were firm as a rule, pork prod
ucts being firm and advancing, hides and leather also
on the up grade and wool and woolen goods firm and
in demand. The regular fall demand for merchandise
was reported brisk all ever the country, with, a marked
expansion in the South. The railroads reported a
heavy movement of goods and complained of contin
ued scarcity of cars. Leading Western centers re
ported improved collections. The great iron strike
continued to ease off with the opening of still more
works and the demand for finished iron and steel
products showed a marked increase, with a good deal
of business ordered, but necessarily postponed. The
business already booked promises continued activity
throughout the winter. The inquiry for boots and
shoes is so brisk that many wholesalers and jobbers
are insisting upon having their contracts closed at
once so as to -insure delivery. Briefly, from all over
the country the commercial reports indicate that the
present activity in trade will continue over into the
next year at least. The tide of prosperity shows no
signs of ebbing.
But there was a curious feature to this. This pon
toon bridge over a financial flurry was made possible
by exceptionally sound business conditions all over
the country, brought about by that same President
who lay under the surgeons' instruments at Buffalo.
President McKinley's election had built a solid foun
dation of prosperity on which the nation rested se
curely when the founder of that prosperity was laid
low. It was precisely like inoculation in advance of
an epidemic. No such ; occurrence has ever before
been witnessed in the history of American commerce.
Had any other political party been in power it could
not have happened. Everybody recognized that the
President had created such prosperity that even when
the assassin's hand struck him down that prosperity
held the country up. It shows what z t wise adminis
tration of public and financial affairs will do in an
emergency. Nor will the negative side of the ques
tion be lost on the community.
THE close of the week was distinguished by a
pronounced drop along the whole line of se
curities in Wall street. This was not wholly
due to the attempted assassination of President Mc-
Kinley on the preceding day, but was largely the
effect of an unfavorable bank statement, aggravated,
of course, by the crime of the anarchist. A poor
bank statement had been expected, and the leading
financial interests of New York had already met and
r.greed to stand under any bad break in stocks on Sat
urday morning before it was known that the Presi
dent had been shot. The break came along on time and
the market went off from two to ten points, but the
banks announced that everybody would be protected,
the clearing-house was prepared to issue millions of
certificates to tide over the emergency, and what
might havt been a bad piece of financial business was
softened down to the proportions of an incident.

This lesson of the time should be the chief theme
of the orations of the day and of the thoughts of the
people. California can afford for once to turn aside
from exultation in her greatness and her increasing
wealth and power, to consider seriously the duty
which her people owe to themselves and to the laws
of the great free republic under which they live.
There are some offenses which statutes cannot.effec
tively deal with, but which are amenable to the bar of
public opinion, and by that powerful authority can be,'
if not suppressed, at least so checked that the evil
will be greatly diminished. One of those offenses is
that of yellow journalism. Dr. David Starr Jordan
summed up the moral of the whole lesson in his state
ment of yesterday: "We cannot suppress the agitator
or the journal, for foice only increases the danger;
but we have a moral duty to stand\pgainst all move
ments of whatever kind which seek to accomplish
their ends through intimidation or murder."
That is the lesson and the moral for the people of
California to take to their hearts on this anniversary
of the State festival. If they sink^ deeply into the
hearts of the people and take root there to grow into
a firm resolve we shall not have had our mournful
holiday in vain. r
The instinct of the people roused to activity by the
crime has unerringly detected one of the most potent
of the many causes that have led up to the develop
ment of anarchy among some of the lower grade of
the foreign elements among us. .The people now per
ceive that the Emma Goldmans of the time are not
alone in their responsibility for the crime. A" reckless
and pervert journalism too long tolerated among us
has been hardly less pernicious than the. anarchist
teachere themselves. In that judgment the reason of
the wisest and the best confirms the instinct of the
masses. The presidents of our universities have united
in emphasizing that lesponsibility. Thus the issue is
presented to serious and earnest patriots whether or
not they will any longer give even an indirect sup
port-to that evil which has now proved itself so ter
ribly dangerous to society.
There is something almost maddening in the
thought that in a land of freedom and of prosperity
like this such a malignant spirit as that of anarchy
should ever find lodgment in the breast of even the
most vicious and insane. The evil spirit is here, how
ever, and its appalling mischief has been wrought. It
will be for the people of California on this holiday
to ponder deeply upon the significance of the tragedy
and consider well what steps should be taken to expel
from our shores the spirit that caused it. , .: ;
CALIFORNIA'S annual festival in celebration
of her admission to the Union will be kept
to-day with more of mournfulness than of re
joicing. The thoughts of the people are turned not
to the scene where the celebration will be observed
by the Native Sons and Native Daughters, but to
the bedside of the stricken President. It is true that
the first dread shock caused by the attempted assas
sination of the President has passed away and san
guine hearts have hopes for his recovery, but the
danger of death is still too imminent for any one to
feel in a mood for gayety; and," moreover, whether the
President rally or fail during the day, the feeling of
grief and rage that such a foul offense should have
been committed in cur republic against the chief
magistrate is still burning too deeply and too hotly
for any one to put it aside for a holiday.

The Examiner has instructed them that they have
all the powers of government, and many that govern
ment has rot and dare not exercise. It has led them
into- weakening the good rights they have by fantas
tically claiming those which are at war with law. !
The Examiner is making ready, to falsely claim for
itself the credit of an end of the strike, and to deceive
its dupes into the belief that they have gained what
they sought. What their leaders seek, is the right
to dictate to the wage-paying employer in the tran
saction of his business, to whom he shall sell and of
whom he shall buy. When the struggle ends, as it
will end by the denial of this. right of dictation, labor
unionism in all its legitimate purposes will be j,ust
where it was before, untouched and unharmed, and
the Examiner lies about the real issue in order that
it may cla:m that undisturbed status as a victory. It
will deceive but a few. When a majority of the wage
earners gc. back to work upon the same terms on
which they could have continued in unbroken em
ployment they will hc.ve gained nothing that their
leaders contended for. But they will have lost many
weeks' wages, to the injury of their families, and will
have forfeited the good will of thousands of pro
ducers all over California whom they have"'b6en led to
injure and in many cases to ruin. " ..'. b
We say in all candor to the strikers who are mis
led by evil counsel and lying that no community ever
yet surrendered to force and as long as it
had the means of resistance.
It is this erratic and tyrannical use of power with
out responsibility that is at issue, and not beneficial
unionism at all.
The question at issue is not the existence of union
ism, but the attempt of union leaders to usurp the
place of the employer by compelling his employes to
obey their orders in the transaction of his business.
These leaders, who arc now in alliance with the Ex
aminer, ordered members of the Teamsters' Union
not to haul freight or baggage for customers of their
employers to whom the leaders objected. The right
of these leaders to exercise that absolute domination
over the business of employers is the sole question
at issue. It is a question which the Examiner in its
own case would settle exactly as the employers have
done. If the pressmen of that paper refused to run
off an edition that contained the advertisement of a
non-union firm they would be instantly discharged,
just as the teamsters were who refused to haul non
union baggage. Such discharge would be no more
a lockout than this widespread strike is -a lockout.
Such action by pressmen would be in all respects ex
actly like the action of the union teamsters, without
the faintest shade of difference, and every newspaper
proprietor and every business man knows that the
Examiner would do exactly what the employing dray
men did. Now, one need not search f%r for proof
that this new policy of the autocratic leaders of union
labor means just such interference with the lawful
rights and business of newspaper proprietors as well
as of other business men. The Employers' Associa
tion has advertised generally in the press of the State
for labor to take the place of the strikers. This was
sent out and paid for- as a regular advertisement in
the usual and daily course of business in all newspa
per offices. This advertisement ran in the Examiner
and was paid for. It also appeared in the Herald of
Grass Valley, and the labor unions in that county,
which have' been recently addressed by Organizer
Pierce, immediately ordered, instituted and are now
by such order maintaining a. boycott of the Herald
to punish it for taking that advertisement. Here is
the assertion of a discrimination and the power to de
stroy one man's business and at the same time build
up the business of another, though both have done
the same thing for which this new union policy or
ders' the ruin of another! The Grass Valley paper
must be ruined by the order of men who cheer and
support the Examiner, though it did the same iden
tical thing!
In the same reckless spirit of falsehood the Ex
aminer speaks always of the strike as, "a lockout," to
give the impression that employers were the aggress
ors and ' wantonly locked out their employes to de
stroy labor unionism. Of course the statement is
false. No fight is made on labor unionism in any
of its relations to the welfare of labor, to hours or
wages. In all such respects unionism had been will
ingly recognized by the employers, who, relying on
the good faith of union labor, had in numerous in
stances made contracts with their union labor, as
such, in order that labor might be assured of con
tinued employment and wages on conditions agree
able to it as union labor, and that the employer might
safely plan for the future on the basis of stability in
his relations to the labor employed.
To right-minded men would occur the misfortune
of 400 employes discharged through a blow struck
by a newspaper at their employer's business. No hu
mane man would rejoice at such a calamity to labor,
if it occurred. But such considerations do not affect
the Examiner any more than the obligation of a man
or a newspaper to tell the truth. .
:The publication of this lie was to encourage the
strikers, by making them believe that following its
advice to injure employers of labor was effective and
would coerce employers to yield. . .
â¢ That paper, knowing the statement to be a lie, pub
lished that Levi Strauss & Co., the. firm that, it ad
vised to be boycotted, had suffered so in its trade that
it had been compelled to discharge 400 employes.
This it did after it knew the falsity of the statement,
and when the firm asked it to publish a respectful let
ter in denial it refused to do so.
IF the strikers do not go, and remain, wrong in
respect to their relation to the law, it will not be
for lack of false, evil and incendiary advice given
by their organ, the Examiner.
CELTIC UNION'S CELEBRATION
ARRANGEMENTS ARE FINISHER
Jamaica is but a small island and her trade is in
significant in comparison with that of the United
States; nevertheless it will bear watching. It affords
a good opportunity for applying that peculiar kind
of reciprocity that some Eastern people have lately
advocated) It supplies the Eastern market with sugar
and fruit and takes manufactured goods in return.
Thus, if reciprocity could be arranged, the East would

most of the competition, and there are a number of
Eastern people who would be quite willing to make
that kind of arrangement.
It is to be noted that the chief products of Jamaica
are sugar and fruit,. and of these the exports are
mainly to. this country . N The report says: "Sugar
was shipped almost entirely to the United States and
to the United Kingdom in the proportion of eight to
one. Fruit almost exclusively to the United States."
The imports ff om this country were made up mainly
of coal and cotton goods. Of the latter the increase
of imports has been quite striking, and it appears
our manufacturers of cheap cotton fabrics will v event
ually have the bulk of the trade.'
lines of commercial, expediency and is increasingly
made up of imports from. this country. Thus the re
port shows that in 1896 the percentage of Jamaican
imports taken from the United States was 41.8 per
cent and in ; i960 43 per cent, while the proportion from
the United Kingdom, which in 1896 was 48.1 per cent,
was in 1900 47.2 per, cent. In neither imports nor ex
ports does the trade with Canada show any increase."
Of the exports 1.6 per cent went to Canada in 1896 and
the same proportion in 1900; while of the imports 7.5
per cent were taken from Canada in 1896 and 7.1 per
cent in 1900.

MANILA, Sept. 8.â The Insurgent lead

men, a number of rifles and a quantity of
ammunition. Numbers i of other small
surrenders occur daily. The only active
forces operating now â¢ with any number
of men are those of Malvar and Lukban.
The capture or surrender of the former
ia expected at any time. The latter, the
Filipinos believe, will hold out as long as
he is able to get ammunition. His broth
er, a doctor In Manila, says Lukban will
never surrender.

Forty miles away is one of the Japanese

be. a split -in the organization of the
Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel
and Tin Workers in this city. The radi
cals will undoubtedly claim the charter
of the association, but President Redfern
says, as president of the lodge, he will
hold on to the charter as the action taken
at the meeting was constitutional. Trou
ble is looked, for when the men return
to work to-morrow.
r J"ib. question. of returning to work was
debated at length, and after every mem
ber had had his say President Joseph D.
Redfern ordered a secret ballot taken.
An appeal was made. The appeal was
referred to the vice president of the lodge,
whose duty it. is to act in such an ex
igency. The lodge waited fifteen minutes,
and the vice president failed to take any
action on the appeal. President Redfern
then appointed tellers and ordered that a
secret ballot be taken, whereupon, the
radical element left- the lodge in a body.
The -radicals slightly outnumbered the
conservatives. Those remaining in the
lodge then voted unanimously to return
to work. . .

The officers of the Brotherhood of
Teamsters have followed their recent
open letter to the Merchants' Association
with another, issued to the press yester
day, as follows: ;
To the Members of the Merchants' Associa
tion â Gentlemen: A few days ago we took the
liberty of placing before you certain facts in
reference to the present condition of labor in
San Francisco. We are informed that you are
to hold a general meeting of your society ou
Tuesday. We therefore beg of you to extend
your Indulgence to us so that we may call your
attention to certain facts and the practical ap
plication of the same, which we feel sure wlil
be to your interests and prosperity.
This is a commercial city. No one in it is
independent of the other. The city exists be
cause of the trade that is carried here. In
jure, the trade and you Injure the city anÂ«i
every class in the city. Now the Employers'
Association has caused this lockout. It v has
crippled the transportation facilities of San
Francisco. It has done this without any cause
or justification. Therefore the Employers' As-
Fociation is injuring every class, every inter
est in the city, and you, who are merchants,
it is injuring above all. It is therefore to your
interests and prosperity to put yourselves on
record with regaoi to this wanton Interference
of a secret and irresponsible society with the
course of trade. The agreement which we had
with our employers was satisfactory to them
and us. - It was the fruit of a period of great
prosperity and was working without a hitch.
The Employers' Association compelled the
draymen to break that agreement. We ask
you, therefore, to mark -your condemnation of
such unwarranted interference with the -busi
ness of other people. Strengthen the hands of
the draymen who wish to throw oft the tyran
ny of this secret coterie and to resume busi
ness under the old conditions. By doing this
you will injure the real rights of no party and
you will restore peace to this detracted city.
Again, many of you are members in name of
this Employers' Association, but in name only.
You have not been consulted as to its course,
many of you vehemently disapprove of it. You
are in the hands of a narrow junta that is ex
ploiting you merely to gratify its pride and re
sentment. Are the days of Nero come again?
Must San Francisco burn that a click of rich
men may indulge In mock heroics at their
clubs? You and you alone can stop this folly.
Demand a meeting of the members of the
Employers' Association that you may be able
to put a term to. the stupidity that is perpe
trated in your name. If you cannot get a meet-
Ing of the Employers' Association then this
meeting of the Merchants' Association will
serve to mark your indignation.
We beg most respectfully to remind you that
the wage earners of this city have always
treated the merchants well. After all we pay
the taxes. Every tyro in political economy
knows that taxes come not from the landlord
but from the ' tenant, not from the merchant
but the consumer. Â¦ Every- man who rents,
every -"man who' sells makes provision for the
taxes in the rent he fixes and in the price he
demands. Now we who pay the taxes have
acted generously with you the merchant. For
the past decade we have practically given the
government of the. city into your hands. We
gave | you the new charter, which is a mer
chants' charter. The major portion of the city
revenue has been spent downtown and for
your benefit.- We need not remind you that
what has been given may be taken away. We
have no desire to Inaugurate a class warfare,
but a class warfare is forced upon us by
those who claim to represent you. We are
the people. We can at the polls choose our
own officials and make our own laws. It you
should find that in the future the city grows
niggard with you and puts In force regulations
to hamper you that other cities do not scruple
to enforce then you may place the responsibil
ity on this secret clique that is defying nat
ural justice and setting at nought public opin
ion and making the name of., merchant and
employers to ba an evil odor in the nostrils of
all fair-minded men. . .
Â¦ Now, gentlemen, the case is in your hands.
You are men of business and you know how to
act for your. best interests. Again let us say
we all in this town stand or fall together.
Whoso injures us injures you. You will there
fore be doing, what â¢ your prosperity . demands
and what the people expect from you when
you condemn the policy of the Employers' As
sociation and demand with rightful Indignation
that the misguided men who rule it shall cease
from their policy of anarchy and destruction.
Respectfully yours, JOHN McL.AUGHL.IN,
. Secretary Brotherhood of Teamsters.

The police give the affair an entirely
different version. They say arrests were
not made except when unprovoked at
tacks were made upon the disguised po
liceman and that the ruse resulted in ab
solute proof that union pickets are guilty
of assaults upon non-union laborers.
"The arrest of these men was the re
sult of a plan conceived by Lieutenant
Price and was unwarranted. A police offi
cer disguised as a sailor was sent out
with orders to raise disturbances so. that
the other officers could arrest the men
who were. foolish enough to take part in
them. The officer, of course, was ac
costed by the pickets, but they made no
assault on him. On the contrary the offi
cer started the rows and attacked the
men, who did nothing but ask him if he
were working. He was not long at work
when we were warned that an officer was
masquerading for the purpose of making
wholesale arrests and we immediately
sent word to the pickets to watch out for
him. Then he began feigning drunken
ness. He would stagger into a group of
men, bumping against them, and if any
man said a word to him out came his
club and at fight and an arrest were the
results. It was a disgraceful proceeding,
in line* with Price's record and the desire
of the employers to provoke outbreaks so
that the National Guard troops may be
called out."
, The arrest of twenty-four men, twelve
of whom wete union sailors, by Lieuten
ant Price and the harbor police Saturday
night was the cause of great indignation
yesterday around the union headquarters
on East street. John Kean, treasurer of
the City Front Federation and captain of
pickets, said yesterday: .â¢ Â¦ _

Strike Leaders Say Pickets Were

The ships Montebello and Clan Graham

lier Milton, were treated at the Harbor
Hospital yesterday for injuries received

it was being hoisted out of the hatch.

night. Seven men of the crew of the A.
G. Ropes were put aboard of her to com
plete her complochent. Â¦ .
Many draymeh are anxious that the end
of the controversy be reached, but ap
parently the majority of the draymen and
other employers Immediately" concerned
are not willing that- even partial recogni
tion of the unions be conceded, to even
the slight degree involved in conference
upon questions of hours and wages. It Is
the knowledge of this frame of mind on
the part of the majority of employers that
leads to despair of a speedy settlement.
With the teamsters and the machinists
the problem is a very different one, and
much privation already exists in their
families.
, Cm the water front the strikers look
ahead to weeks of idleness with indiffer
ence. It is claimed that contributions
from other branches of the International
Seamen's Union are sufficing to pay the
strike benefits, leaving the fund of the
local union unimpaired except as it is
drawn upon to relieve particular cases of
suffering. Each sailor receives $3 per
week, which satisfies the claims of his
boarding-house master. In times of in
dustrial peace the, boarding-house master
furnishes bed^and board to the sailor in
port for $5 per week, but he is under con
tract that in. time of strike he shall fur
nish bed and board, of a sort to keep body
and soul together, at $3 per week. The
sailor who has a little fund laid up for to
bacco and other extras can live an in
definite time on his strike benefit and be
happy.
Developments of importance are not ex
pected to-day. Little work will be done
in the wholesale district/ and what teams
go put will take special officers as guards.
The draymen have been notified that no
regular police officers will be detailed to
protect non-union teamsters to-day. Both
employers and strike leaders say there
will be no conferences, and that whatever
there is to be in the way of negotiations
for peace must wait until to-morrow.
The confidence felt by the striking- team
sters that agreement will be reached by
Wednesday at latest is perceptibly weak
ening. The strike leaders particularly
are saving that hope of settlement is
slight, and they are preparing to settle
down to a long-drawn test of strength, to
be ended only by the defeat of one party
to thÂ«' controversy. .
I . MPLOYERS and strikers made
I a the .most of the weekly day of
I rest yesterday, and the California
H holiday will be similarly observed
to-day. The managers of both
sides were not to be found at their offices
any time during the day, and industrial
affairs drifted along- entirely without
change.

the most important of all the matches,
will be played. The contestants will \ be

This leaves Miss May Sutton and- Miss
Seymour and the Misses Florence and
Ethel Suttoh to play in ..the finals this
morning. The latter will allow Mjss Sut
ton and Miss Seymour odds of half-fifteen.
In the next match the Misses Florence
and Ethel Sutton, being much stronger
than the other teams, allowed Miss Hoff
man and Miss Violet Sutton odds of half
fifteen. The handicap proved to be much
too small as the Suttons won in straight
sets. The score was 6-1, 6-1, 6-3.
Miss Hall was unable to play and aa. this
left Ethel Sutton without a partner it' was
decided that the losersâ Mrs. Seymour
and Florence Sutton â should draw lots to
see who would be Ethel's partner.
The first match was between May Sut
ton and Miss Seymour and Florence Sut
ton and Mrs. Seymour.'- After playing the
full five sets victory finally .went to the
former team. The score was 7-5, 4-6. 6-4,
6-8, 7-5. The match was exceedingly close
and the outcome in doubt until the. finish.
The invitation 'doubles tournament for
women, held yesterday at San Rafael,

like all the others of the series, the Dudes
hammering a brace of Senatorial pitchers

The class stake was made up of cham
pions. Homer Boy beat Game Boy for
rinal honors. The run-down in this event
resulted in many upsets. Wedgewood
showed how poorly he can run when the
desire overtakes him. He looked on while
his opponent outworked him.
ORIGIN All ARRANGEMENT
OF INVITATION DOUBLES
Hickory Dick was the surprise of the
stake and will be heard from in the near
future. As a whole the event has brought
out a good lot of youngsters. The win
ner showed the requisite qualifications of
the successful courser, and great things
are expected of him. The stake was run
off satisfactorily. Judge Grace was up to
his usual form, and Jim Grace acquitted
himself splendidly in slipping the lot of
comparatively green youngsters without
a mishap.
Sir Pitt looked a strong aspirant for
final honors at one time, but with 5 to 1
on his chances was retired by Partial
Eclipse.
Freeze Out was not expected to get
through the stake, being rated a good
one, but physically unfitted to run up to
her reputation. Her defeat of Tame Tra
lee in the fourth gave her backers a
faint hope, but the hope was dissipated,
when In the next round she got an unde
cided with Hickory Dick, and in the run
off lost to him.
COLD SHIVERS, the strongest and
best of the For Freedom-Ama
rosa litter, won first honors in
the big Futurity stake at Union
Coursing Park yesterday, beating
George Nethercott's Rochester-Little
Wondersnippy'in as pretty a final as has
been seen on the grounds in many days.
The entire stake, for that matter, was of
the higher order and was productive of
many courses of the kind in which the
winner can be called only after the last
point Is made.
George Malcolm's Aeolus, though being
retired from the game in the fourth
round, earned a reputation as a brilliant
' young courser. .- Aeolus had- a strong fol
lowing that look*ed upon him as the most
likely candidate. His first course in yes
terday's finals was deemed a gift and the
dope-mixers figured a quick trial. An
athletic hare, however, made things look
dark and gloomy for those who had
chosen the fast youngster for their choice.
Not that the course was at any time in
danger of being lost, for Aeolus had dem
onstrated his superiority over his oppo
nent in a. very -decided manner, but the
hare was determined, too, and before it
was dispatched it set the favored hound
a long and killing trip. In the very next
course the unfortunate hound had a rep
etition of the chance-destroying worn,
and in the following go fell a victim, as
was expected, to Cold Shivers.
In the seventh the Senators 'scored
again, making the board read 3-1. Score:
Mohler opened the Dudes' end of it in
the sixth by rapping out a pretty . three
bagger to far-away left. Streib, whose
counterpart in face and figure Mohler is,
did not help the new man in any way by
dying a sudden death. But "Truck"
Eagan did. He hit to Devereaux, who
errored, and Mohler stamped upon the
rubber. Then Drennan hit, as did Francks,
and the bags were filled, with only one
man out and Arrellanes at the bat. He
hit a short one which only served to end
Eagan's "career as he rushed toward the
plate, but left the bags filled again. Loh
man then flew to McLaughlin and Dude
hopes died.
Sacramento won the game yesterday af
ternoon not because the Senators pounced
down upon "Youngey" Johnson, but be
cause Oakland was unable to take ad
vantage of good opportunities in the sixth
Inning, when the only bunching of hits
off McNeely marred an otherwise perfect
piece of slab work. At this time the Sen
ators had worked two men over the plate,
one in the first and one in the fourth
inning.
The tailenders have at last reached a
measure of baseball excellence. "With
Mohler in Arrellanes' place the team
seems strengthened beyond its original
self. And this man Mohler knows the
game and how to play it. He has won the
popular favor by clean, fast baseball, and
his record in the few games he has played
makes him deserving of the public's ap
proval.
at Recreation grounds has been the most
remarkable since the season began. All
the matches except the Sunday morning
game at Oakland, resulted in close scores,
and out of the five games the Dudes
walked off the sand with four victories
to their credit.

FACULTY GIVES
F1SHER CONTROL
Decides That Arbitration
Is Impossible in the
Nourse Matter.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept 8.â
The faculty committee has decided that
arbitration in the case of John T. Nourse.
; the treasurer of the student body, is Im
possible. They have given to Ralph S.
Fisher, captain of the varsity football
team, complete control over the ath
letic interests, virtually making him, dic
tator of athletics. Captain Fisher was
officially Informed of the decision of the
faculty committee by the following let
ter which was given out for publication,
this afternoon:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 7. 1901.â
Mr. Ralph S. Fisher, Stanford Universityâ Dear ,
Sir: In 'View of the situation set forth in a let
ter to the president of the Associated Students,
and in a resolution of the executive committee* -
in response thereto, copies of which are at
tached to thia, you are hereby instructed bjr
the committee on student affairs to assume tna
management of the athletic Interests of tha .
university, to control the collection and dis
bursement of funds and to -take charge of tbÂ«
property of the Associated Students.
In the, exercise of the power conferred you
are to be independent of control of the officers
of the Associated Students, until Instructed to
1 relinquish authority to a properly qualified
treasurer. â¢.
It is understood that in athletic matters yon
are to act under the direction of the faculty
committee on athletics. R. I* GREEN.
Chairman Committee on Student Affairs.
..The letter to the president of the As
sociated Students mentioned in the abovo
letter was published in The Call yester
day. The resolution of the executive com
mittee of the Associated Students in re
sponse thereto is as follows:
Resolved, That the executive committee In
executive session deplores the fact that there
has been a misunderstanding between tha offl- -
cers of the Associated Students and the commit
tee of student affairs, but after due considera
tion it deems it unwise to take any action in
the matter of student body treasurer, believing 1
that, so far as the students are concerned. Mr.
Nourse holds his position legitimately, and that
any further action on Its part would be In ex
cess of its authority.

R. J. McFADDENÂ« '04.
Nourse declines to state what action he
will take in the matter, but affirms hlsÂ»
intention of continuing in the exercise of
his duties as treasurer.
It Is understood that the money of the
Associated Students; which is In the Bank
of Palo Alto, has been placed beyond
Nourse's control by faculty action. It is
possible that this may call forth legal
action on the part of the treasurer. Ex
citing developments along this line are
expected to-morrow. There may, how
ever, be no direct legal clash until the
first campus game occurs, at which timo
money as gate receipts will be. collected,
and the faculty committee has authorized
Captain Fisher "to control the collection
and disbursement of funds." "What lha
outcome will be in event of both Treas
urer Nourse and Captain Fisher attempt
ins to take the gate money is difficult to
foretell.

OAKLAND. Sept. 8.â The baseball team
from the Bohemians of America again
proved themselves champions by defeat
ing the Dewey Theater nine by a score
of 8 to 2. The game was a fast one frorii
Ftart to finish. The Dewey team put
Ru=sell the former pitcher for the Oak
land nine of the California League into
the box. but the Bohemians landed on
Â«.Kussell's curves harder than any Cali
fornia League team ever did. Fiege, the
Ditcher for the Bohemians, picked three
hits, and Bill Ward, the first baseman
for the lodge team, got a double and
three singles. Flege and Callahan. the
batten' for the Bohemians, again proved
that they could do as nice battery work

fessional league.
When it came to the selection of an
umpire there was much debate as to what
should be done. There seemed. to be some
objection to nearly every one who was
f-usreested. At last Manager Char.es lvonl
of the Bohemians said he would Uke;-t-Â»
have Landers Stevens, the manager of the
;, ewcy Theater, to act in that capacity.
That was a bombshell in the Dewey camp,
and they took their own manager for
umpire. The Dewey team lost and now
they are blaming it all on the Â«â¢"

"Present Day Xihilists" was the subject
of the Rev. Ernest E. Baker's sermon at
the First Presbyterian Church. Dr.
Baker said:
The late Benjamin Disraeli was wont to say
'the unexpected always happens." The truth
of this dictum is Ftrikingly illustrated In the
attempted assassination of the President. The
civilized world has been shocked by the sad
news and waits with us in anxiety for the final
1fsuÂ». Hoping against hope we unite in the uni
versal prayer for the President's recovery and
Fj>eedy restoration to family, friends and peo
jile. Heartsick we address ourselves to the in
quiry. "Why was this deed of wanton cruelty
done?" With peace and prosperity at home
and like conditions prevailing in our foreign re
lations it cannot be charged to politics, national
tir international.
If we are correctly informed the would-be
murderer seeks to extenuate his crime by con
struing Mr. McKinley into the representative of
capital. Never was greater mistake made in
ttie man or the office. The President is per
force President of all the people and not of any
class however influential. And those who know
( ihe man need no assurance that hie first con
cern is the welfare of the American citizen,
however humble.
Personally 1 do not think we can -attribute
this terrible deed to the struggle now on be-
tween capital and labor. It is to be remem
bered that the labor problem is as old as time
and as universal as man. It is not confined to
any one race or country or form of government.
Its weapons are not powder and dynamite.
These are the peculiar property of those ene
mies of organized society called anarchists, ni
hilists and revolutionary eocialists. In all
countries and under all governments a group
of persons, men and women car be found whose
quarrel is with government in the abstract as
well as in the concrete. AH forms of govern
ment are equally oppressive in their eyes and
to be destroyed. Hence their resort to violence
in Russia, Italy. France and America.
The lesson of this national tragedy Is that
liberty is not to be confounded with license;
republican government is not to be confounded
with the shout of popular anarchy; freedom is

Â¦ If there is a man living whose love for his

He had nothing but what he had won by sheer

country, from private life to the House of Kep

of the United States who loves liberty and fol

and religion to constitute himself a committee
of one as a sentinel "with eternal vigilance"
to hunt down anarchists and such like ene
mies of real liberty, truth and freedom.
And that the voice of sorrow, commingled
with sympathy and condemnation, was heard
In the fnited States from the remotest cor

if not a positive proof that God's divine order
in society will prevail and anarchy and such
like will go down where such damnable ideas
were conceived in the hell of the powers of
darkness.
The mind that plots to nullify the effect of
the President's power and office, much less to
take away his life, can aspire to no higher
place In the scale of principle and purity than
the mind of Satan, who sought to dethrone
his God and was satiated only in the eternal
ruin and destruction of the angels. No won

than the number in the class of 1904. This
is all the more noteworthy when it is re
membered that this year's class Is fully
7 per cent larger than last year's. '. This
sudden decrease in ' the " attendance of
women students is unprecedented in the
history of the university. Heretofore the
women have entered in such numbers that
they threatened for a time to outnumber
.the men. The change is considered sig
nificant, though the causes are difficult to
determine. , . . ; Â¦ . ...
It being early in the evening when the
fire broke out, few of the hotel occupants
were asleep, and the firemen . and police
had no : difficulty in alarming i every one
in the building.- All of the storekeepers
carry insurance, so the net loss will not
be very heavy. Baker / Martin suffers
most severely, as nothing was left of nls
business. ' . ..".
At 8:30 o'clock the department was
called to the Liberty bakery, 857 Wash
ington street, where a big pot of hot
grease had boiled over, setting the base
ment kitchen ablaze in an instant. The
bakers had barely time to escape before
the - place was a roaring furnace. The
fire worked upstairs into the hotel, and
smoke added to the damage. The firemen
saved the building by hard effort and the
flames were confined in greater part to
the bakery, but this was destroyed. -
Clem Martin, the owner, is absent from
the city and the amount of his insurance
was not available.. His loss will reach
$10,000. The fire worked Into Robert Vin
cent's butcher -shop, at 853 Washington
street. Smoke did much damage there,
as well as to Christensen &. Shaw's sa
loon, at 851 Washington street. * .
At the same number is C. E. Qiiigley's
cigar store, which was slightly damaged
by smoke. William Heyers' saloon, 859
Washington street, and his residence up
stairs were filled with smoke. . The hotel
building Is owned by A. Bocqueraz. His
loss will be $2000 for repairs. The proprie
tors Of the hotel are Henri Cammas and
Pierre ! Rouguet, who recently purchased
it for $3000. They carried $1500 insurance
on the furniture. Water ; and smoke
caused their loss, except where fire 'broke
through the ll walls '.from the .bakery
kitchen. .: ' A.

years ago he withdrew from all active

The remarkably youthful appearance of
Mr.' and Mrs. Jacobs is evidence of the
happy wedded life they have led.' Their
fifty years of conjugality have been almost
free from the cares that beset the lives
of others. They look upon the loss of
their only son as their greatest sorrow.

TACOMA, Sapt. 8.â Fish Commissioner
Little returned to-day from California,
where he visited the fish hatcheries at
Battle Creek and Baird, on the Sacra
mento River, with the object of ascer
taining if any improved appliances or
methods unknown here are in use in Cali
fornia. He says the California hatcheries
are doing splendid work, but are scarcely
more up-to-date than the hatcheries now
In operation in this State.

TACOMA, Sept. 8.â After being induced,
as she says, by h^f husband to sign an
agreement permitting him to get a di
vorce and consent to the division of $7000
worth of property on his terms, Mrs. Ab
bie L.. McReavy has reconsidered her de
cision, and yesterday filed a cross-com
plaint, in â¢ which she makes sensational
charges against her husband, L. L. Mc-
Reavy, a Northern Pacific engineer. Mrs.
McReavy first came Into prominence
about a year ago, when in a fit of tem
porary insanity she jOmped from the Oak
land ferry-boat into San Francisco Bay.
In October last she was committed to the
Steilacoom Insane. Hospital; remaining
there less than three months. She avers
she was harassed into signing the agree
ment mentioned, and alleges that her hus
band has subjected her to cruel treat

ity," "Seashore," "Friendship," "The

ELKS ENJOY THEMSELVES
ON BEACH AT CAPITOI/A
This afternoon the Archbishop visited
St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum, where a
class of one hundred and fifty boys were
confirmed. His Grace was assisted In the
ceremonies by Rev. John Egan, his first
assistant; Rev. Father Crowley of the
Youths' Directory of San Francisco and
the Rev. Father Phelan, the asylum chap
lain.
At the close of the ceremonies the con
victs, both Catholic and non-Catholics,
presented the Archbishop with an elab
orately engrossed address thanking him
for the aid rendered them by the church
through the ministrations of her priests.
Fathers Eggran and Phillips were heartily
thanked for their kindness to the/con
victs. To Father Sesnon, "the convicts'
friend," was conveyed the thanks of all
the prisoners, Irrespective of creed, and
an earnest prayer that God may bless and
preserve him.. The address was signed by
twelve men, six Catholics and six non-
Catholics.
SAN RAiTAEL., Sept. 8.â About twelve
hundred convicts crowded Into the library
building at San Quentin prison this morn
ing and eagerly listened to an address
delivered by his Grace Archbishop Rior
dan. Fifty-two of their number were con
firmed In the Catholic faith. Twenty re
ceived their first communion, while one
hundred approached holy communion.
Ten were baptized into the church yes
terday by Father Sesnon.
To-day was one of the most memorable
In the history of the prison. Nearly all
the convicts attended the services. The
hall was beautifully decorated for the oc
casion. Special music was provided by the
prisoners. After the eonlirniatlon cere
monies Archbishop Riordan delivered a
powerful sermon on the text, "You can
not serve two masters." It was not the
kind of an address that is usually given
to prisoners. If his Grace had occupied
the pulpit of a large church and had been
speaking to a fashionable gathering he
would have spoken much .the same. No
mention did he make of the condition of
his auditors. He spoke to his text and
commanded the closest attention through
out.

The schooner Rosamond is fourteen
days out from Honolulu to-day and should
arrive any time now. She has a cargo of
16â¬9 tons of sugar aboard and a. fair pas
senger list. Among those coming on her
is P. Maurice MacMahon, Hawaii's Irish
poet. The object of his visit to San Fran
cisco is to publish a volume of his poems.
Mr. MacMafion is the official stenographer
to Hawaii's first Territorial Senate. He
will not make a long stay in California.
Schooner Rosamond Due.
It was seven years ago yesterday since
Captain Blair of the Alaska Commercial
Company brought his last. command into
port. He was then master of the bark
Electra and had aboard about seventy
Native Sons, who were returning from the
canneries, eager to take part in the Ad
mission day celebration. The captain was
telling yesterday how he was becalmed
in a dense fog and a tug came i along,
which asked $250 to tow him in. After
considerable dickering a bargain was
made for $125 and the Native Sons arrived
in time for the jollification. Since then
Captain Blair has been "ship's husband"
for the Alaska Commercial Company, u
The naval training ship Mohican is at
Astoria. She will remain there a few
days and will then continue her cruise.
The cruiser Philadelphia is now out
with the members of the Portland Naval
Militia. As soon as that cruise is over
she will- come back here and take out the
San Francisco boys.
WaterTront Notes.
George Curry and Edward Fernandez
were seriously injured on the steam col
lier Milton yesterday. A bucket of coal
as it was going aloft tipped and the con
tents, over a ton in .weight, fell on the
two men. Both received lacerated scalps
and badly contused shoulders, while it. is
feared Fernandez is internally injured.
Injured on a Coal Ship.
Texas is counting on having a bigger
cotton crop in 1901 than it gathered in
1900. Its acreage for 1901 is 25 per cent
greater than that of 1900.
THE time of the log raft has come
again, and for two months to
come these menaces to navigation
will be heading for San Fran
cisco. The tirst of this year's
ventures is now on the way in. tow of the
tugs Tatoosh and Richard Holyoke, and
if all goes well it should reach here next
Wednesday. . .
This immense mass of logs was built
at Westport on the Columbia River and
cost $30,000 to construct. It is 625 feet
long and 60 feet beam, with a depth of 32
feet, and draws 20 feet of water. The
raft is really a huge bundle of piles, some
of which are twenty-two inches in diam
eter at the butt and 120 -feet long. It con
tains 7,200,000 feet of lumber. Captain
Robertson, the builder, says the ratt will
reach San Francisco in safety, and thai
it will make the ninth that he has suc
cessfully handled. Half a dozen others
were not' such a success, however. Some
of them went to pieces and for months
the huge piles floated around, a menace
to navigation. Others broke in two and
only half of them reached port. All in all,
however, the successes have more than
counterbalanced the failures.
The raft now on the way here stuck on
a bar when leaving Westport, and at first
it was feared it would have to stay there
until next year. It was finally floated
over, however, and got into the Colum
bia River. An examination failed to find
any damage, but the towing in the open
sea will soon discover the defects if there
are any. Should one log work its way
out of the raft the whole structure will
stand a good chance of going to pieces.
mous cargo of 8500 barrels of salmon. Cap
tain Nick Rossich tried hard 'to keep his
men by the ship, but they would not stay.
He offered them $4 a day if they would
remain and discharge the vessel, but they
would not entertain the offer.
Osterhout Is being congratulated on the
fact that the robber overlooked a hand
some diamond stud which was in his shirt
front. The burglar also failed to go
through his victim's coat pockets. In the
right breast pocket of the coat was a wal
let containing $500 in currency.
Osterhout saw that resistance was use
less and let the robber have his way. Af
ter securing his victim's valuable watch,
$1 50 in small change that was in the
trou. Â»rs and the revolver, he left the
room. As soon as the man had gone Os
terhout jumped out of bed, and, rushing
to the head of the stairs, flung a hand
some cut glass vase after his retreating
figure ' The missile failed to hit the rob
ber, who went out of the front door and
quickly disappeared.
Osterhout's business keeps him up to
an early hour in the morning. On Friday
morning he retired to his room about 4
o'clock. Before retiring he extinguished
the light, but left the door open, as he
expected a male friend of his to occupy
the room with him that morning. He does
not know how long he slept, but he was
aroused .by. seme one in his. room. He nat
urally supposed that it was his friend and
paid- no further heed to the matter. At
last his suspicion was aroused at the long
time -the man was groping in the dark.
Osterhout turned on the incandescent
light in his room and was surprised to
find a stranger in his room going through
his trousers pockets. The man wore a
black handkerchief tied over the lower
part of - his face. . . Â»â¢- *
Osterhout reached for his â¢ revolver,
which he had laid on a small table -.at
the side of his bed and found the weapon
was gone. The robber, had his revolver,
and, pointing it at his victim, .told him
to remain quiet or "he would be carried
out of the house in a box."
Schuj'ler Osterhout. familiarly known
as "Sky" in sporting circles, and one of
the proprietors of the Baldwin Annex
poker rooms, was the victim of a dating
robbery early Friday morning in his
room at 126 Ellis street.
The new bIH which opens at the Chutes
to-day includes Sisson .Wallace â¢ and com
pany in a bright sketch, entitled "Love
Finds a Way"; Ernest Yerxa, a contor
tionist; Ada Sweeney, in illustrated songs;
the Standard Quartet, Murphy and Hart,
Irish | comedians; - Ameta, the .spectacular
dancer, and new moving pictures. A spe
cial feature to-night will be a grand dis
play of fireworks. â¢ *
Among famous revivals that Miss Flor
ence Roberts has given at the Alcazar
during her present engagement* none will
be more popular than that of the present
week, "The Taming of the Shrew." Miss
Roberts will, appear, as the shrewish
Katherine and White Whittlesey as Pe
truchio. They will be well supported by
the clever Alcazar Stock Company. Â¦â¢ '' .
Â¦ Von Suppe's deliglftful mythological op
eretta, "Beautiful Galatea," will be given
at Fischer's Concert-house this evening
with a cast including Mabel Martin, Min
nie Huff, Frank Onslow and Henry Ro
land. .An excellent performance is prom
ised. Others on the programme are Mae
Tunisdn, soprano; Wren and Linden,
sketch artists; June Mathias," Sam Holds
worth, tenor, and Merle Stanton, ballad
ist. ' - - Â¦ Â¦Â¦>..: Â¦ ,
A: good bill of the week- will be a spec
tacular presentation of "Quo Vadis," to
be produced at the Grand Opera-house,
-with Joseph Haworth in his famous part
of Vinicius. . Mr. Haworth will be well
supported by the Grand Opera-house com
pany, and the production will be on the
usual sumptuous scale that one has come
toexuect at this theater. .. " . <
."A Voice From the Wilderness" Is draw
ing crowded houses at the popular uptown
house, the Central, and is improving with
rapid strides at each presentation. The
production has created the widest inter
est and many of . the players have won
individual successes in their parts. Mi&s
Marshall as Herodias, Mr. Downing as
John the Baptist, Miss Downing as Hul
dah, Oza Waldorp as. Salome,"' are all fine
ly 'cast, and the staging continues' to
arouse a hearty chorus of commendation.
It will run for the week.
One of the best casts of the season has
been chosen to . interpret . Gounod's
"Faust" to-night at the Tivoli, the same
cast concerned in the rendition of Boito's
"Meflstofele" a week aeo, but with the
valuable addition of Salassa, namely,
Agostlni, Montanari and Dado. Coming
so closely after the Boito edition of the
story "Faust" will be doubly intereating.
The alternate bill of the week/beginning
Tuesday, is "Carmen,", by long odds the
most popular bill of last season. It is
Collamarini's big part, and she is -a most
satisfying gypsy. Russo is Don Jose and
Ferrari sings the "Toreador." - ..
- Last night a crowded house greeted the
revival of "Barbara Frietchie" at the
California Theater. This most popular
bill of the current season of the Neill
Company will be repeated to-night and
this, the last week of the engagement,
will be given over to the following reper
tory: Tuesday evening, "The Jllt' T ; Wed
nesday evening, "A Bachelor's' Ro
mance"; Thursday matinee, "The Jilt";
Thursday evening, "A Royal Box," and
Friday (farewell), "The Lottery of Love."
The present Neill season, has been un
usually successful and every one will â¢ be
sorry to take leave of these popular play
ers. "The Jilt". is among the novelties in
revivals and will no doubt draw a large
contingent of curious play goers.
Annie Russell, with her. delightful pro
duction â¢ of "A . Royal Family," will re
main the attraction at the Columbia The
ater for' another week, commencing with
this evening. The star, her excellent'sup
porting company and R.- Marshall's
charmingly, told romance of comedy have
made . impressions of a very high order.
Theater goers have been crowding the Co
lumbia for. the oast week and will no
doubt continue to fill- the house up to the
close, of Â¦ ." the engagement on Saturday
night. The second and last matinee will
be given Saturday. Next Monday night
the attraction at the Columbia is to be
Comedian Thomas Q. Seabrooke in Syd
ney Rosenfeld's new romantic comic play,
"A Modern Crusoe," with Isabelle Eves
son in the leading feminine role. The
production and cast are both said to be
unusually attractive.
'Â¦Â¦ One of the cleverest one-act plays (pre
sented in this city for some time is the
prize play written by. - ; Thomas Frost,
called "Chums,"; which was presentechby
George W. Leslie , and ' company at the
Orpheum last night. It affords the Les
lies,-Lester Wallack Jr.\ahd ! Miss Louise
Willis ample opportunity to show a thor
ough appreciation of the comedy, which
lurks in its lines and is replete with funny
mix-ups, due to misunderstandings which
the dialogue develops that keep the au
dience convulsed with laughter.- '
"The Debutante," cleverly rendered
last week by J. Aldrich Libby, Kathryn
Trayer and John D. Gilbert, is a good
holdover, and . was so cleverly presented
last night that the audience called the
trio before the curtain. The reappearance
last I night of . Ernest Hogan, ."the un
bleached American," brought forth hear
ty applause. His rendition of coon songs
captured the house. The other holdovers,
Powell, the magician, the La Vallee trio,
shapely Mile. Lotty and the American
Biograph all help to make one of the best
programmes that has been seen" at the
Orpheum for some time.
